2
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:29,745
Let me take that.

3
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,913
No way, I already told
you, I can carry my one bag.

4
00:03:33,682 --> 00:03:35,454
Sorry I dragged you
all the way out here.

5
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:37,852
Give me a couple of days.
I'll take care of things,

6
00:03:38,254 --> 00:03:39,425
and we go back home, okay?

7
00:03:40,461 --> 00:03:43,055
I'm actually really happy
I came out with you.

8
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,727
That's nice to be
out of the city and

9
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:46,432
unplug and

10
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:50,568
be in a place
where time has kind of stopped.

11
00:03:51,404 --> 00:03:53,307
Time passes in its
own way out here.

12
00:03:54,076 --> 00:03:55,738
Nothing has changed
since I was a kid.

13
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:02,448
Oh my goodness.
Not even the goats?

14
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,319
They're so cute! Ah!

15
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:08,586
Yeah, they used to drive
me nuts when I was a kid.

16
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,427
That is awesome.
I bet you were such a cute kid.

17
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,364
Yeah, I was crazy.
Like a tornado.

18
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,500
Well, I guess,
not much has changed.

19
00:04:21,869 --> 00:04:24,030
Yeah, so you better
not mess with me.

20
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:25,064
Hey!

21
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:28,441
Good, my shoulder hurts anyway.

22
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:33,644
Hey! Hello!
Welcome! Vivien!

23
00:04:34,013 --> 00:04:37,450
- So nice to meet you!
- So nice to meet you, finally!

24
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,784
- So good to see you.
- Oh, good to see you!

25
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:43,852
Come in, come in!
Lunch is ready!

26
00:04:43,887 --> 00:04:45,656
- You must be starving!
- Yeah.

27
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:18,854
- What? Really?
- Yeah.

28
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:20,526
I like so much here.

29
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:23,562
- Oh. Here you are.
- This house is so beautiful.

30
00:05:23,597 --> 00:05:26,895
Oh. Thank you. May I introduce
you to Roy's other aunt?

31
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,369
- Concetta.
- Vivien.

32
00:05:34,036 --> 00:05:35,574
They don't speak English very
well, be patient.

33
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:54,153
So. Uhm. Are you guys engaged?

34
00:05:57,532 --> 00:05:58,696
Why don't you tell her?

35
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,537
So what did he say?

36
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,869
Oh, it's a secret.

37
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:09,201
No fair, secrets
don't make friends.

38
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,675
Mmm. No, they don't.

39
00:06:11,244 --> 00:06:13,843
Uh, Roy. Did you go
see the farmhouse?

40
00:06:14,615 --> 00:06:16,010
Not yet.

41
00:06:16,045 --> 00:06:19,783
Oh, it's in bad shape. Every
time I go there, I get mad.

42
00:06:20,051 --> 00:06:21,785
It's best for everyone
if we sell it.

43
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,593
How's school going?

44
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:30,464
It's over. I lost
my scholarship.

45
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,697
What happened?

46
00:06:32,732 --> 00:06:35,062
I got it because
I was on the swim team.

47
00:06:35,097 --> 00:06:36,965
And I'm not on the team anymore.

48
00:06:37,267 --> 00:06:40,034
Couldn't you find a
job and pay for it?

49
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:42,036
You could work with your dad
at the garage.

50
00:06:42,071 --> 00:06:43,576
College is too expensive.

51
00:06:44,011 --> 00:06:45,644
That's why I wanna sell the
farmhouse,

52
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,042
so I can pay the tuition fees.

53
00:06:49,584 --> 00:06:52,486
Whatever you want, Roy.
Grandma left it to you.

54
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,941
What happened here?

55
00:07:20,912 --> 00:07:21,911
There was a fire.

56
00:07:22,346 --> 00:07:24,551
It spread to the house
and destroyed it.

57
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,146
How old is this place?

58
00:07:26,448 --> 00:07:29,523
It's been in the family
for generations.

59
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:29,011
I'm actually a bit sad
about selling it.

60
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,310
So many memories.

61
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,049
You grew up here.

62
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:36,590
Yeah, and I chose to leave.

63
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,222
Uhm Hey! You made it.

64
00:08:42,895 --> 00:08:43,894
Are you okay?

65
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:45,665
Yeah.

66
00:08:46,034 --> 00:08:47,667
- What are you?
- Oh

67
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:49,834
- Are you an object?
- Yeah.

68
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:55,576
Oh! This is my favorite.
Okay, uhm Can I use you?

69
00:08:56,843 --> 00:08:58,007
Yes, you can.

70
00:08:58,676 --> 00:09:02,077
Okay. Uhm Can Does
everyone use you?

71
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:05,718
- A lot of people, not everyone.
- Are you a household appliance?

72
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,754
- Not only.
- Are you a kitchen appliance?

73
00:09:09,218 --> 00:09:10,316
No.

74
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:12,923
You're not a hose, are you?

75
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:18,896
Are you colorful?

76
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,031
Come on

77
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:29,928
Hello?

78
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,494
Hey!

79
00:11:39,236 --> 00:11:42,402
I'm so sorry, I don't speak
Italian. Do you speak English?

80
00:11:42,637 --> 00:11:45,240
Yeah, I Uhm I didn't
mean to scare you.

81
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:46,340
- Get up here.
- Thank you.

82
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,507
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

83
00:11:49,378 --> 00:11:50,377
Fine.

84
00:11:50,912 --> 00:11:57,054
Uh That is very heavy.
How do you ride this thing?

85
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,057
Haven't you seen my muscles?

86
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:02,488
I'm Vivien. Hi.

87
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:03,322
Anna, nice to meet you.

88
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:05,524
That
actually does look kind of bad.

89
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,263
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Let's get you inside and

90
00:12:08,298 --> 00:12:10,199
We'll clean that up
so that doesn't get infected.

91
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,071
I'm fine, really, I don't
I don't wanna bother you.

92
00:12:14,106 --> 00:12:16,370
No!
Do not be ridiculous, come on!

93
00:12:16,405 --> 00:12:18,372
- Are you sure?
- Yes, of course!

94
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,079
Your English is so good!

95
00:12:22,114 --> 00:12:24,279
I I studied in
America for a while.

96
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:33,387
What are we doing here?

97
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:35,158
Come with me!

98
00:12:35,193 --> 00:12:36,522
I'm sorry Sir,
there's nothing I can do,

99
00:12:36,557 --> 00:12:38,524
that reservation was
definitely canceled.

100
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,558
Oh God

101
00:12:42,497 --> 00:12:47,434
Hey. Did something happen?

102
00:12:47,469 --> 00:12:50,140
Yeah, one of the artists can't
come. It's a major disaster.

103
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:51,977
He supposed to check
in this morning,

104
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:53,946
he didn't show up and now the
whole show is falling apart.

105
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:54,914
I'm so sorry.

106
00:12:55,616 --> 00:12:56,883
-Love, this is
-Roy, right?

107
00:12:56,918 --> 00:12:57,984
Yes.

108
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:59,479
Roy, I couldn't wait for
you to get here. I'm Thomas.

109
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:01,283
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

110
00:13:01,318 --> 00:13:02,451
Oh

111
00:13:02,486 --> 00:13:04,990
I'm so sorry, I have to go
and take care of this mess.

112
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:06,255
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. Go fix it. Love you.

113
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,289
Love you too.

114
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:10,457
So where did he come from?

115
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,998
I met him in London
at an exhibition.

116
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,266
And Vivien's been putting up
with you for what Six months?

117
00:13:17,301 --> 00:13:18,366
Give or take.

118
00:13:19,035 --> 00:13:21,138
She ain't exactly low
maintenance either.

119
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:23,943
So you're made for each other.

120
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:28,442
Well This was your mother's.

121
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:33,150
We used to dream about meeting
our true loves, getting married

122
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:34,987
and Vivien

123
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:40,223
I have a feeling she can't wait
to get a ring on her finger. So

124
00:13:44,493 --> 00:13:47,296
- Thank you.
- Oh Don't make me cry.

125
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:51,630
Hey listen, I used up my film.

126
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,500
Is there anywhere
I can develop it?

127
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,975
Sure! Thomas has a dark room
at the gallery, let's go!

128
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,472
Thank you, you saved me.

129
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,245
No, trust me, you saved me.

130
00:14:02,577 --> 00:14:04,049
My uhm

131
00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:07,646
My boyfriend and I came to visit
his relatives and

132
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:13,685
It's just really not been easy
to find someone to talk to.

133
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,027
Yeah, I'm sorry, it's

134
00:14:15,763 --> 00:14:18,195
A lot of Italians
don't speak great English.

135
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,494
Yeah, but you're pretty fluent.
Where did you go to school?

136
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:23,904
Oh, this place in In New Jersey.

137
00:14:24,773 --> 00:14:27,171
New Jersey, really?
That's where we're from.

138
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:33,375
- So, do you study Medicine?
- Ah No. Physics.

139
00:14:34,147 --> 00:14:35,377
That's really cool.

140
00:14:35,912 --> 00:14:38,380
It always fascinated me,
but I never thought I could

141
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:40,052
understand it.

142
00:14:42,254 --> 00:14:43,352
So

143
00:14:43,387 --> 00:14:44,958
How do you manage it
while you're here?

144
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:49,523
I don't. Uhm, but I'll
go back really soon

145
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:51,459
And I'm so excited

146
00:14:51,494 --> 00:14:53,263
because my school got me

147
00:14:53,298 --> 00:14:55,694
this internship
with a big company.

148
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:59,236
- So, I'm happy!
- Yeah, sounds cool.

149
00:15:00,602 --> 00:15:04,571
- What do you do?
- Oh I I do a bunch of things.

150
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:07,211
Right now I'm here
for the<i> vendemmia</i>.

151
00:15:07,642 --> 00:15:08,707
The grape

152
00:15:09,578 --> 00:15:10,610
- Harvest.
- Oh, cool.

153
00:15:10,912 --> 00:15:12,249
And it starts tomorrow,

154
00:15:12,284 --> 00:15:14,284
you really really have to come.

155
00:15:14,619 --> 00:15:16,990
I can't tomorrow.
I leave tomorrow morning.

156
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:20,059
You know, I've got an idea

157
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,295
- You're coming with me.
- What?

158
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,297
Oh, it's your last
day here and you

159
00:15:27,632 --> 00:15:30,234
can't spend it
cooped up in here all alone.

160
00:15:34,504 --> 00:15:35,503
So, do you like it?

161
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:40,013
Oh "I like it"
is an understatement.

162
00:15:40,609 --> 00:15:42,015
It's beautiful.

163
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:43,577
Good, I'm happy.

164
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,284
It's one of my favorite places.

165
00:15:47,853 --> 00:15:51,585
- It's just so nice to just walk.
- Yeah.

166
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:53,191
Thinking

167
00:15:56,064 --> 00:15:57,129
So serene

168
00:15:57,659 --> 00:15:59,098
It is, it's quiet.

169
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,165
No people.

170
00:16:02,201 --> 00:16:04,136
- Yeah.
- Just the two of us.

171
00:16:19,681 --> 00:16:20,680
What are you doing?

172
00:16:21,485 --> 00:16:24,057
I'm gonna go for a swim.

173
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,488
- What?
- Yeah.

174
00:16:27,457 --> 00:16:31,328
You're gonna go swimming right
now Isn't it like too cold?

175
00:16:31,697 --> 00:16:34,661
Oh, it's never too cold in
Sicily, believe me.

176
00:16:34,696 --> 00:16:36,333
The water is great!

177
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:41,767
Oh my Goodness, it's
gonna be so cold!

178
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,574
Oh, I'm good about that!

179
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:01,820
Oh yes! Freedom!

180
00:18:40,228 --> 00:18:43,163
This is, honestly, breathtaking.

181
00:18:43,865 --> 00:18:47,299
I told you. I knew you
were gonna love it.

182
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,928
Uh How did that happen?

183
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,472
- Uhm Shark attack.
- What?

184
00:18:57,245 --> 00:19:01,610
Oh, you
had me. You had me!

185
00:19:01,645 --> 00:19:05,383
I got burned when I was a kid.

186
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:12,951
And I guess you really
shouldn't play with fire.

187
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,197
Well

188
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:23,302
I think scars are kind
of really beautiful.

189
00:19:24,602 --> 00:19:28,208
They like tell a person's story.

190
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,970
Well, maybe one day
I'll tell you mine.

191
00:19:33,677 --> 00:19:34,841
- Deal.
- Yeah.

192
00:19:36,713 --> 00:19:42,255
I have to tell you, I think your
boyfriend is a really lucky man.

193
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,423
Have you guys been together
for a long time?

194
00:19:48,824 --> 00:19:49,955
No.

195
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:55,829
But Roy was there for me in
like, a really

196
00:19:58,306 --> 00:20:00,570
bad time in my life.

197
00:20:00,605 --> 00:20:01,604
Uhm

198
00:20:02,673 --> 00:20:03,672
And so I feel like

199
00:20:04,906 --> 00:20:07,280
I don't know, like
he knows who I am.

200
00:20:08,877 --> 00:20:09,843
Yeah.

201
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,615
What about you? Do you
have someone

202
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,782
special enough
to appreciate all this beauty?

203
00:20:15,884 --> 00:20:17,752
Actually Yeah, I do.

204
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:19,721
His name is Tony and I've

205
00:20:20,356 --> 00:20:23,461
I've known him for a
really really long time and

206
00:20:25,663 --> 00:20:26,464
It's just that

207
00:20:27,896 --> 00:20:30,930
I think you never
really know people.

208
00:20:39,644 --> 00:20:41,611
Where were you?
I called you all afternoon.

209
00:20:42,746 --> 00:20:44,614
Uhm I made a friend.

210
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:47,749
The reception was bad
and then my battery died.

211
00:20:47,784 --> 00:20:49,289
This is Anna, by the way.

212
00:20:49,758 --> 00:20:53,722
Nice to meet you. Vivien
told me so much about you.

213
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,464
You had me so fucking worried.

214
00:21:00,764 --> 00:21:02,093
I'm sorry, baby.

215
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:04,337
I thought you were going
to be back way later.

216
00:21:04,672 --> 00:21:07,571
And then Anna showed me this
amazing place, so beautiful.

217
00:21:07,606 --> 00:21:08,407
Yeah.

218
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:11,443
I really have to go, so

219
00:21:12,078 --> 00:21:14,578
I hope I'll get to
see you again. Yeah?

220
00:21:14,613 --> 00:21:18,417
- Yes, very nice to meet you!
- Yeah, for me too! Bye!

221
00:21:18,452 --> 00:21:19,682
- Bye!
- Bye bye!

222
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,690
Who was that? Mm?

223
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:32,024
I told you, this
girl I met today.

224
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:36,369
Uhm, she fell off her motorcycle
and I helped her out.

225
00:21:38,472 --> 00:21:40,472
Then she took you on
some sort of adventure

226
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,441
just because she liked you?

227
00:21:42,806 --> 00:21:43,673
Yeah.

228
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:48,645
I'm sorry, are you like, jealous
or What's happening here?

229
00:21:49,945 --> 00:21:51,010
No, I'm just curious.

230
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:55,014
Okay.

231
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:57,555
Are you packed?

232
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,856
Yeah, I have
a couple of things left to grab.

233
00:22:03,024 --> 00:22:04,023
Okay, we should hurry up.

234
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:06,630
We're leaving
at the crack of dawn tomorrow.

235
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,699
Oh my God!

236
00:22:43,801 --> 00:22:44,536
What happened?

237
00:22:45,902 --> 00:22:48,540
A volcano erupted and they
canceled all the flights.

238
00:22:49,142 --> 00:22:52,577
I guess you already know.
Our volcano is a female.

239
00:22:53,481 --> 00:22:55,580
Unpredictable and restless.

240
00:22:55,782 --> 00:22:57,417
We need to get the
hell out of here.

241
00:22:57,819 --> 00:22:59,881
But they don't know when the
flights are gonna resume.

242
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:02,114
You're not stuck here forever.

243
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:04,050
You can make it a vacation.

244
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:05,491
I could use some extra hands.

245
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,724
- What for?
- What do you mean "what for"?

246
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:10,892
The grape harvest!
You guys can help!

247
00:23:11,594 --> 00:23:15,798
A grape harvest doesn't sound
that bad. I've never been.

248
00:23:17,868 --> 00:23:18,801
It's so annoying.

249
00:23:24,941 --> 00:23:27,073
No need to run!

250
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:39,085
This is my boyfriend Tony.

251
00:23:39,287 --> 00:23:40,252
- Hi!
- Hi!

252
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,660
- Vivien. Nice to meet you!
- Nice to meet you.

253
00:23:42,695 --> 00:23:43,427
He's a singer.

254
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,926
Do you play the guitar?

255
00:23:44,961 --> 00:23:47,764
I can drink wine also.

256
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:50,063
Yeah!
That's a great answer!

257
00:23:50,098 --> 00:23:51,064
Yeah.

258
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:54,133
- I like that.
- Just need a bit of red courage.

259
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,709
Hey!

260
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,915
You, wait there.

261
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,082
Wait.

262
00:26:49,343 --> 00:26:50,408
That was fun.

263
00:26:52,082 --> 00:26:53,081
Yeah.

264
00:26:53,985 --> 00:26:55,413
Do you mean now or today?

265
00:26:55,748 --> 00:26:59,318
Both

266
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:01,958
Yeah.

267
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:08,800
Anna and Tony are
so cute together.

268
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:10,670
I guess.

269
00:27:12,003 --> 00:27:13,805
You don't like Anna, do you?

270
00:27:15,204 --> 00:27:16,434
I don't know, like

271
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:19,338
She's always hanging around you,
haven't you noticed?

272
00:27:21,177 --> 00:27:22,176
I mean

273
00:27:23,377 --> 00:27:25,883
We like each other, that's all.

274
00:27:28,756 --> 00:27:30,954
She showed up at the house
when you were all alone.

275
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:32,450
Out of the blue.

276
00:27:33,354 --> 00:27:34,727
Don't you think it's weird?

277
00:27:36,027 --> 00:27:38,995
No, I told you. She
fell off her bike.

278
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,326
Did you see her fall?

279
00:27:40,528 --> 00:27:43,164
No, but

280
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:49,302
Why would she do that,
like, who would fake that?

281
00:27:49,337 --> 00:27:50,743
She was bleeding.

282
00:27:51,405 --> 00:27:52,404
I don't know.

283
00:27:52,706 --> 00:27:54,307
I'm just telling you
what I think, but

284
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,013
I'm sorry if I upset you.

285
00:27:58,346 --> 00:27:59,818
No, I'm not upset.

286
00:28:01,855 --> 00:28:02,854
I just

287
00:28:05,925 --> 00:28:07,826
I just think she needs friends.

288
00:28:09,225 --> 00:28:10,224
You just met her.

289
00:28:12,426 --> 00:28:13,766
You never really know people.

290
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:26,207
Roy?

291
00:29:19,328 --> 00:29:23,429
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

292
00:29:23,464 --> 00:29:26,168
eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,

293
00:29:26,203 --> 00:29:27,906
seventeen, eighteen,
nineteen, twenty,

294
00:29:27,941 --> 00:29:29,303
-twenty-one
-You're amazing!

295
00:29:32,242 --> 00:29:33,141
Yes!

296
00:29:33,177 --> 00:29:35,012
- Hey, you two!
- Hey, babe.

297
00:29:35,047 --> 00:29:36,849
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

298
00:29:36,884 --> 00:29:37,916
Good morning, April.

299
00:29:39,117 --> 00:29:40,116
Hi.

300
00:29:42,516 --> 00:29:43,988
What's going on?

301
00:29:45,321 --> 00:29:47,827
The school called.
They're moving up my internship.

302
00:29:48,588 --> 00:29:50,830
- When do you start?
- A week.

303
00:29:52,229 --> 00:29:53,459
Don't worry. We'll
be home by then.

304
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:56,297
What if they don't
reschedule the flight?

305
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:58,970
Don't worry, we'll
figure it out.

306
00:30:58,493 --> 00:30:59,492
Do you like it?

307
00:31:00,594 --> 00:31:02,198
Yes, looks like a sketch.

308
00:31:03,034 --> 00:31:04,563
It's all in the eye
of the beholder.

309
00:31:07,106 --> 00:31:08,941
This artist has an amazing eye.

310
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:12,670
You do too. That's
why I called you.

311
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:16,949
Now, the thing that really
struck me about you, Roy,

312
00:31:16,984 --> 00:31:18,676
is there's something

313
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,349
uneasy, you know?

314
00:31:21,884 --> 00:31:24,352
Something restless
in your landscapes.

315
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,650
Take a sit.

316
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:32,558
Each shot conveys
something different,

317
00:31:32,927 --> 00:31:36,067
and yet they all have
something in common.

318
00:31:36,597 --> 00:31:37,596
Your gaze.

319
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:40,269
I'm not sure what
you're getting at.

320
00:31:40,771 --> 00:31:43,404
One of the artists just
backed out the show I'm doing.

321
00:31:44,273 --> 00:31:46,440
I've been looking
for a new talent.

322
00:31:46,775 --> 00:31:50,246
Somebody who's got something
truly original to contribute.

323
00:31:50,581 --> 00:31:51,814
I was getting desperate

324
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:54,954
because you know how hard that
is to find on such short notice.

325
00:31:55,323 --> 00:31:58,089
And Laura brought
me your photos.

326
00:32:00,456 --> 00:32:02,555
I'd like to show these
if that's all right with you.

327
00:32:04,097 --> 00:32:05,965
Are you kidding
me? That's amazing!

328
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:09,760
I have to talk to Vivien but
Yes, thank you so much!

329
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:11,003
No, no. Thank you.

330
00:32:11,872 --> 00:32:16,305
So, I'll start working on this
and I plan to see you tomorrow

331
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,273
What time?

332
00:32:17,308 --> 00:32:18,538
Yeah, I can't wait to start.

333
00:32:18,573 --> 00:32:19,473
At 2:30pm?

334
00:32:19,508 --> 00:32:20,507
- Yeah.
- Great.

335
00:32:22,577 --> 00:32:24,181
- Hey!
- Hey!

336
00:32:24,216 --> 00:32:25,446
Thomas wants my photos!

337
00:32:26,284 --> 00:32:28,086
- What?
- Yes!

338
00:32:28,121 --> 00:32:30,022
He wants to do a show
in his art gallery!

339
00:32:30,858 --> 00:32:32,585
I'm so excited, I
can't believe it!

340
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,522
That's awesome! Congrats, baby!

341
00:32:35,557 --> 00:32:37,623
- When is the show?
- I still don't know.

342
00:32:38,494 --> 00:32:39,658
Well

343
00:32:39,693 --> 00:32:41,132
We should probably
figure that out,

344
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,002
because I have to leave soon
for my internship.

345
00:32:45,204 --> 00:32:47,336
What? What did I
say? What's wrong?

346
00:32:49,142 --> 00:32:50,768
I thought you would
be happy for me.

347
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:55,212
Of course I'm happy for you
I'm so happy for you!

348
00:32:55,247 --> 00:32:57,049
Yeah, so happy you
can't wait to leave!

349
00:32:58,481 --> 00:33:02,450
Uh I have to actually get back,
this is about my future.

350
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:04,782
Do you still give a
shit about my future?

351
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,091
That's why we're here!

352
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,819
For your future,
that's why we came,

353
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:10,194
so that you could
sell the farmhouse

354
00:33:10,229 --> 00:33:11,360
and have money for school.

355
00:33:17,698 --> 00:33:18,697
What?

356
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:21,799
I don't think school is the
right path for me anymore.

357
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:26,210
What?

358
00:33:26,712 --> 00:33:27,640
What are you talking about?

359
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:29,807
Are you coming with me or not?

360
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,315
Hi, uhm

361
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:35,648
- Bad timing?
- No No, not at all.

362
00:33:37,355 --> 00:33:40,422
- Guys! What are you up to today?
- Nothing!

363
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:43,821
Wonderful, then come with us,
we're going for a walk.

364
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:46,527
No, man. I don't feel like it.
I'm not in the mood.

365
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:49,233
I do! Sounds like a great idea.

366
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:52,203
Great. Let's go.

367
00:34:00,642 --> 00:34:02,279
You're so quiet today,
something wrong?

368
00:34:04,448 --> 00:34:05,612
Oh

369
00:34:08,188 --> 00:34:12,685
I have to go back to the States,
but I think Roy wants to stay.

370
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,259
You guys had a fight?

371
00:34:18,495 --> 00:34:21,826
It's more like I'm learning
things about him

372
00:34:21,861 --> 00:34:23,630
that I didn't know before.

373
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,369
Mm

374
00:34:25,405 --> 00:34:27,733
Well, I guess that's quite
normal when a relationship

375
00:34:27,768 --> 00:34:29,240
starts to get more serious.

376
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,439
Do you still trust him, right?

377
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:33,640
Yeah.

378
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:38,249
Hey, where are you going?
Aren't we going to the top?

379
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:39,877
Yeah but

380
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,253
That way is way more difficult.

381
00:34:43,817 --> 00:34:45,421
It's way faster.

382
00:34:45,456 --> 00:34:47,390
I don't think so.
It's not faster.

383
00:34:47,425 --> 00:34:48,754
Why don't we have a race?

384
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:50,822
It's gonna be boys against girls

385
00:34:50,857 --> 00:34:53,264
- Race, race, race, race.
- Okay.

386
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,134
That's a stupid idea.

387
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:57,499
Well, I think the boys
are just scared

388
00:34:57,534 --> 00:34:59,732
that we're gonna kick
their asses.

389
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:02,768
Okay then. Remember,
no running allowed.

390
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,408
And I'll know if you cheat,
so don't even try.

391
00:35:05,443 --> 00:35:07,806
All right, I'm gonna send you
a postcard from there.

392
00:35:07,841 --> 00:35:09,643
- Yeah. I'll send you one too.
- Signed it.

393
00:35:09,678 --> 00:35:10,677
Yeah.

394
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:22,293
Is it gonna be like
this the whole way?

395
00:35:23,494 --> 00:35:24,493
Pretty much.

396
00:35:26,233 --> 00:35:27,265
I need help.

397
00:35:38,872 --> 00:35:40,311
At the end of the month

398
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,279
I'm doing a gig
with my band in Catania.

399
00:35:42,513 --> 00:35:43,710
I would have invited you guys.

400
00:35:45,384 --> 00:35:46,812
Is that what you do?
Are you a musician?

401
00:35:47,815 --> 00:35:49,221
Is that your thing?

402
00:35:49,949 --> 00:35:50,948
Yeah.

403
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,785
After ten years of school. Yeah.

404
00:35:53,154 --> 00:35:54,490
But it's fine, it's my thing.

405
00:35:56,593 --> 00:35:58,395
What about you?
Are you studying at school?

406
00:36:00,531 --> 00:36:03,532
I'm still looking for my thing.

407
00:36:23,554 --> 00:36:28,260
Anna! What are these trees
called? They're so beautiful!

408
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:38,864
Anna!

409
00:36:45,675 --> 00:36:46,674
Anna!

410
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:55,012
Oh shit!

411
00:36:59,854 --> 00:37:00,853
Anna!

412
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:07,365
Can anyone hear me?

413
00:37:17,102 --> 00:37:18,607
Your girlfriend seems amazing.

414
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:21,544
Anna was telling me
she studies incredible things.

415
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,448
Yeah, she's very determined,

416
00:37:24,983 --> 00:37:27,451
and unlike me,
she always knows what she wants.

417
00:37:27,686 --> 00:37:30,047
Anna is like that too.

418
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:50,672
So, have you guys been together
for a long time?

419
00:37:51,274 --> 00:37:52,641
We've known each
other for years.

420
00:37:53,611 --> 00:37:56,315
But she never saw me that way.

421
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,078
So what changed?

422
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:03,355
A few weeks ago she
came looking for me,

423
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,326
and she suggested
I go with her on this trip.

424
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:09,319
So it hasn't been
that long then.

425
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:13,090
Like, you basically hooked up
right before we got here.

426
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,367
Yeah.

427
00:38:21,705 --> 00:38:22,704
Fuck!

428
00:38:56,542 --> 00:39:00,005
I'm sorry!

429
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,677
Where's Vivien?

430
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:05,142
I don't know, I turned around
and she just wasn't there.

431
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:08,178
Hey, hold on. Breathe!
Tell us what happened.

432
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:11,390
We got lost.

433
00:39:11,854 --> 00:39:13,150
Okay I I

434
00:39:15,055 --> 00:39:16,890
I don't know what happened,
I turned around

435
00:39:17,225 --> 00:39:18,991
and I looked everywhere
and I called her,

436
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:20,157
and she just wasn't there.

437
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,060
I felt the best thing
that I could do

438
00:39:22,095 --> 00:39:22,894
was to come and tell you guys

439
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:24,700
so we could look
for her together.

440
00:39:24,735 --> 00:39:26,768
It was you, wasn't it?

441
00:39:26,803 --> 00:39:28,002
Why are you sayi...

442
00:39:28,038 --> 00:39:31,608
I should have never left her
with you. It's all your fault!

443
00:39:31,643 --> 00:39:34,039
Dude! Calm down! Anna
didn't do anything!

444
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:37,944
Of course she did. It was her!

445
00:39:40,982 --> 00:39:46,425
I get it. You're afraid.
But we have to go find her.

446
00:39:47,626 --> 00:39:48,525
Now.

447
00:39:48,561 --> 00:39:51,727
I think I lost her
somewhere over there.

448
00:39:51,762 --> 00:39:53,465
You think or you're sure?

449
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,731
I don't know, I think!
I'm pretty sure, I don't know!

450
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,436
Take this.

451
00:39:58,471 --> 00:40:00,571
I'm going alone,
you guys go that way,

452
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,573
just in case you got it wrong.

453
00:40:04,577 --> 00:40:05,576
Vivien!

454
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:43,240
Vivien!

455
00:40:46,817 --> 00:40:48,784
Baby, baby wake up, wake up.

456
00:40:50,557 --> 00:40:51,589
Are you okay?

457
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:53,789
- Yeah.
- What happened?

458
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,693
I

459
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:02,633
Can you move your leg?

460
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:03,634
Yeah.

461
00:41:04,604 --> 00:41:05,603
Okay.

462
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:11,972
- What happened?
- I

463
00:41:13,712 --> 00:41:16,273
Uh Ouch, okay, okay, thank you.

464
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:17,780
Are you sure?

465
00:41:17,815 --> 00:41:21,146
Yeah, I don't know, I got lost.

466
00:41:21,181 --> 00:41:23,687
I was looking for Anna.

467
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:37,701
Are you actually okay?

468
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:43,135
I'm okay. I just miss home.

469
00:41:48,945 --> 00:41:52,584
- I don't need to do the show.
- No, you should

470
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:55,312
I miss our lives.

471
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:57,589
I think it's time to go back.

472
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:03,826
Today you really scared me.

473
00:42:06,127 --> 00:42:09,194
I almost lost you once.
I won't let that happen again.

474
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,251
Thomas just got here.

475
00:42:35,662 --> 00:42:37,354
I I think I better
go and talk to him.

476
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:40,764
It's gonna be hard to tell him

477
00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:42,634
I changed idea about doing
the show.

478
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:45,230
I'll see you at home, okay?

479
00:42:45,903 --> 00:42:46,902
Okay.

480
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,439
Wow!

481
00:44:04,146 --> 00:44:05,783
So beautiful.

482
00:44:07,985 --> 00:44:09,985
Wait. Where is everyone?

483
00:44:10,654 --> 00:44:12,757
There's a flower festival
in town.

484
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,924
And they couldn't wait to go.

485
00:44:15,259 --> 00:44:18,158
And I couldn't wait to have
some time alone with you.

486
00:44:19,194 --> 00:44:21,898
Oh, is this all for me?

487
00:44:28,005 --> 00:44:29,466
So did you this all by yourself?

488
00:44:30,942 --> 00:44:32,139
Nicola gave me a hand.

489
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:38,211
To us. To our future together,
and to going back home.

490
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:40,818
Finally they opened up the
flights again.

491
00:44:41,315 --> 00:44:42,215
To us!

492
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,192
What's wrong?

493
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:56,328
You can't pass up that show.

494
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,232
But you need to get back home!

495
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:01,069
What will you do?

496
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,237
I don't know,

497
00:45:04,906 --> 00:45:08,208
I'll call the university,
ask for an extension.

498
00:45:08,243 --> 00:45:09,781
I'll figure it out.

499
00:45:10,817 --> 00:45:12,047
Isn't it gonna be hard on you?

500
00:45:12,883 --> 00:45:15,952
They chose me, and
Thomas chose you,

501
00:45:17,252 --> 00:45:20,022
and your photos are
so beautiful. It's

502
00:45:21,025 --> 00:45:22,024
It's worth it.

503
00:45:23,225 --> 00:45:24,158
You give me strength,

504
00:45:24,193 --> 00:45:26,094
like no one else
has ever given me before.

505
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:31,066
I have a lot of doubts in life.

506
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:35,070
But there is one
thing I'm sure about.

507
00:45:36,469 --> 00:45:38,205
I wanna spend
the rest of my life with you.

508
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:41,406
Would you marry me?

509
00:46:07,401 --> 00:46:10,006
Are you okay?

510
00:46:10,041 --> 00:46:11,909
Me and Tony had
a really big fight.

511
00:46:12,406 --> 00:46:17,310
Oh It's okay.

512
00:46:17,345 --> 00:46:19,279
It's just a fight, you guys
will get past it, right?

513
00:46:22,218 --> 00:46:23,822
Well, where is he right now?

514
00:46:24,191 --> 00:46:26,286
At a party in Noto.

515
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:32,193
Do you wanna go celebrate?

516
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:34,129
Wherever you want.

517
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:37,869
Let's go track him down.

518
00:46:37,904 --> 00:46:39,365
- Okay.
- Let's see what he's doing!

519
00:46:40,269 --> 00:46:41,035
I'll be right back.

520
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:44,271
Okay, we can have a drink.

521
00:46:55,983 --> 00:46:59,451
Oh Wow! Oh!

522
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:01,618
Hi guys, it's a theme party.

523
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:04,995
So girls change in here
and boys over there.

524
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:07,558
Do you want a drink?

525
00:47:07,593 --> 00:47:09,329
Okay, let's go!

526
00:47:09,364 --> 00:47:13,069
Oh wow!
Oh! This is amazing.

527
00:47:13,905 --> 00:47:17,403
- Uh, drinks! Perfect!
- So pretty!

528
00:47:19,374 --> 00:47:23,640
- Okay, what about
-It's too much!

529
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:26,148
- Okay.
- Here! Drink.

530
00:47:29,549 --> 00:47:31,351
I'm really bad at drinking.

531
00:47:31,886 --> 00:47:35,355
- Come on, it's a party.
- I'm such a lightweight Like

532
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:37,291
I know, but I can't
be the only drunk one.

533
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,164
And I'll take care of you
if you get too drunk, I swear!

534
00:47:46,038 --> 00:47:48,665
Uh, good. Wow, oh

535
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,272
- Another one.
- Okay.

536
00:47:53,243 --> 00:47:56,915
- Oh my God, Anna!
- What?

537
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:02,921
- This one!
- Is that for you?

538
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:08,553
- No, what?
- Come on, I can't wear that!

539
00:48:08,588 --> 00:48:10,225
Why not?

540
00:48:11,261 --> 00:48:13,063
It's not for me, you know?

541
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,725
- Oh Okay, is it too much?
- I'm not sexy

542
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,595
- You are.
- And I don't think

543
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:19,102
that's my color anyway.

544
00:48:24,637 --> 00:48:26,978
Okay

545
00:48:31,314 --> 00:48:32,412
It is now.

546
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,448
Well, I guess it
could be for tonight.

547
00:48:35,917 --> 00:48:37,989
Come on!

548
00:48:38,524 --> 00:48:41,619
I'm still the only one that's
getting drunk. It's not right!

549
00:48:41,654 --> 00:48:45,128
Okay Cheers.

550
00:48:58,044 --> 00:49:01,441
- Wow!
- Wow!

551
00:52:55,578 --> 00:52:57,677
Babe, don't.

552
00:53:07,557 --> 00:53:08,556
It's okay.

553
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:13,495
Should I I feel like
Should I go after him?

554
00:53:14,058 --> 00:53:15,266
No, it's

555
00:53:16,533 --> 00:53:18,269
I think you should talk
about it tomorrow

556
00:53:18,304 --> 00:53:19,600
when you're rested.

557
00:53:20,202 --> 00:53:23,571
- It's all right. It's all right!
- Sorry! I

558
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,542
- That's all right.
- I agree. I'm also

559
00:53:27,577 --> 00:53:28,609
like, a little bit drunk.

560
00:53:28,911 --> 00:53:31,975
So I feel like I shouldn't
talk about it tonight.

561
00:53:32,615 --> 00:53:33,614
Yeah.

562
00:53:34,383 --> 00:53:36,914
Let's just. lay down
for a bit, alright?

563
00:53:49,764 --> 00:53:50,763
It's okay.

564
00:54:43,389 --> 00:54:45,015
Stay away from me.

565
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:47,490
Are you
sure that's what you want?

566
00:55:47,046 --> 00:55:48,419
Hey.

567
00:55:48,854 --> 00:55:49,849
Had too much to drink?

568
00:55:53,118 --> 00:55:55,756
I saw you guys dancing in there.
But I didn't say hello.

569
00:55:56,858 --> 00:55:58,121
I didn't wanna talk to Anna.

570
00:56:00,224 --> 00:56:01,828
Anna seems like the coolest,

571
00:56:01,863 --> 00:56:04,402
funniest, sexiest person
in the world.

572
00:56:05,669 --> 00:56:06,668
And she is.

573
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:09,572
But behind all that

574
00:56:11,873 --> 00:56:13,708
she's hiding what
she really wants.

575
00:56:16,911 --> 00:56:18,581
She used me without
a second thought.

576
00:56:22,983 --> 00:56:23,882
You kill the relationship

577
00:56:23,918 --> 00:56:25,951
when you lie to someone
you say you love.

578
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:31,726
You better watch it, Roy.

579
00:56:34,126 --> 00:56:36,731
But you already know
exactly what she's like.

580
00:56:39,571 --> 00:56:40,900
You know her better than anyone.

581
00:56:52,078 --> 00:56:53,748
I really shouldn't have drunk.

582
00:56:56,885 --> 00:56:57,983
I completely overdid it.

583
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:05,760
How come you left last night?

584
00:57:08,226 --> 00:57:09,225
What?

585
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:11,601
How come you left me?

586
00:57:14,298 --> 00:57:16,199
Seems to me you were doing
just fine without me.

587
00:57:24,814 --> 00:57:25,945
Well, nothing happened.

588
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,493
Would you please look at me?

589
00:57:41,226 --> 00:57:43,666
Why does Anna have a tattoo
exactly like yours?

590
00:57:44,867 --> 00:57:45,866
Why's that?

591
00:57:46,134 --> 00:57:47,637
-How the hell should I know
-Uh.

592
00:57:49,135 --> 00:57:50,266
Why are you bullshitting me?

593
00:57:52,908 --> 00:57:54,611
What is going on
between you guys?

594
00:57:54,646 --> 00:57:56,877
There's nothing going on, okay?

595
00:57:57,679 --> 00:57:59,781
- Clearly something is...
- What are you stressing about?

596
00:58:02,115 --> 00:58:03,719
Why won't you tell me the truth?

597
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:06,722
There's something I don't know.

598
00:58:06,757 --> 00:58:09,318
It's you, her, me in the middle
and what's going on?

599
00:58:09,353 --> 00:58:10,693
No, listen to me.
There's me and you.

600
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:13,894
You invited Anna in our life.

601
00:58:14,696 --> 00:58:16,633
I don't wanna have anything
to do with her.

602
00:58:18,868 --> 00:58:20,571
You're not telling me something.

603
00:58:24,874 --> 00:58:28,073
What aren't you telling me?
Is it really that bad?

604
00:58:31,947 --> 00:58:33,078
You don't trust me anymore.

605
00:58:33,547 --> 00:58:35,817
We're supposed to be
getting married now.

606
00:58:35,852 --> 00:58:37,016
Yes, we are getting married.

607
00:58:37,485 --> 00:58:39,854
I'm not fighting about this,
but you're lying!

608
00:58:40,056 --> 00:58:42,560
Have you changed because a
random girl has my tattoo, uh?

609
00:58:42,962 --> 00:58:44,320
I have a million tattoos
on my skin.

610
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:46,993
Because I know there's
something else.

611
00:58:50,801 --> 00:58:52,196
I don't know what
you're talking about.

612
00:58:52,498 --> 00:58:54,198
-Uh
-You're stressing about nothing.

613
00:58:57,236 --> 00:58:58,235
Oh, hey!

614
00:58:59,371 --> 00:59:03,779
Roy, someone made an offer on
the farm. We have to go to Noto.

615
00:59:04,248 --> 00:59:06,177
Okay, I I'll be out shortly,
just give me a second.

616
00:59:06,212 --> 00:59:07,211
Yeah. Okay.

617
00:59:12,416 --> 00:59:14,185
We support each
other, always. Okay?

618
00:59:15,188 --> 00:59:16,187
Tonight I'll explain.

619
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:18,761
Trust me.

620
00:59:20,963 --> 00:59:22,633
Things have been weird lately.

621
00:59:23,068 --> 00:59:24,063
But I love you.

622
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:26,769
Hey.

623
00:59:28,234 --> 00:59:29,640
We made a promise.

624
00:59:32,073 --> 00:59:33,072
See you later, okay?

625
00:59:45,416 --> 00:59:46,822
Thanks for coming.

626
00:59:46,857 --> 00:59:47,889
No problem.

627
00:59:48,591 --> 00:59:50,320
I just wanted to see
it one more time,

628
00:59:50,355 --> 00:59:52,663
although this place really
grabbed me from the get-go.

629
00:59:53,996 --> 00:59:55,666
It's gonna need a lot of work.

630
00:59:56,295 --> 00:59:57,294
Right. Sure.

631
00:59:57,763 --> 00:59:59,835
It's got loads of charm
but it's falling apart.

632
01:00:00,604 --> 01:00:02,937
Still, this is the
right time to invest.

633
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:05,269
We'll put up a terrific resort.

634
01:00:05,671 --> 01:00:07,876
There's plenty of space,
the location is great.

635
01:00:08,144 --> 01:00:10,175
We'll tear all this down
and build it from scratch.

636
01:00:12,113 --> 01:00:14,410
I brought you this.
Just to start with.

637
01:00:17,481 --> 01:00:18,755
It's quite a number.

638
01:00:20,451 --> 01:00:21,824
Can we think it over?

639
01:00:22,453 --> 01:00:23,419
What's going on?

640
01:00:24,054 --> 01:00:25,421
I already gave you an advance.

641
01:00:26,193 --> 01:00:27,192
It's not about that.

642
01:00:28,734 --> 01:00:30,800
Okay. Okay, okay, well.

643
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,198
I can raise the offer.

644
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,101
I need time to think it over.

645
01:00:35,603 --> 01:00:37,807
Until I'll hear otherwise,
this place is still mine.

646
01:00:41,043 --> 01:00:42,306
You're wasting my time.

647
01:00:42,675 --> 01:00:44,847
- What just happened?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

648
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:47,410
I'm gonna call you soon,
in the next few days.

649
01:00:47,445 --> 01:00:48,785
Fucking asshole!

650
01:01:03,901 --> 01:01:06,033
You don't wanna
sell? What happened?

651
01:01:06,402 --> 01:01:08,200
I wanted to, but things change.

652
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,807
Part of me wants to stay now.

653
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:12,809
I feel like I'm finding my way.

654
01:01:13,311 --> 01:01:14,712
You couldn't wait to go home!

655
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:18,012
This is where I feel at home.

656
01:01:20,247 --> 01:01:21,246
But she doesn't.

657
01:01:26,792 --> 01:01:27,725
What if I lose her?

658
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:31,157
If you lose her going after what
you want,

659
01:01:31,192 --> 01:01:33,225
you would have lost her anyway.

660
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:35,766
Think about it.

661
01:02:00,859 --> 01:02:01,858
Viv!

662
01:02:42,263 --> 01:02:43,328
Why are we here?

663
01:02:46,564 --> 01:02:47,970
So you can see for yourself.

664
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:53,844
We used to sit here
together and draw.

665
01:02:58,477 --> 01:03:01,115
<i>He was way better
than me, always was.</i>

666
01:03:05,352 --> 01:03:07,990
<i>This was the kitchen.</i>

667
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,322
<i>We used to have snacks here.</i>

668
01:03:13,492 --> 01:03:16,427
<i>We would measure each other,
kept track of our progress.</i>

669
01:03:17,628 --> 01:03:19,133
<i>He was green and I was purple.</i>

670
01:03:21,071 --> 01:03:22,103
<i>This was his bedroom.</i>

671
01:03:22,672 --> 01:03:24,908
<i>I used to love
playing hide and seek.</i>

672
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,373
<i>I always hid under the
bed, hoping he'd find me.</i>

673
01:03:32,511 --> 01:03:34,445
I remember one time, we laid
together for hours

674
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,886
without saying a word.

675
01:03:35,921 --> 01:03:38,119
Just looking at each other.

676
01:03:49,231 --> 01:03:50,362
This is where the fire came up.

677
01:03:55,171 --> 01:03:56,170
Roy was there.

678
01:03:57,074 --> 01:03:58,073
He saved me.

679
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:00,669
He's always been there for me

680
01:04:00,704 --> 01:04:02,913
and I've always
been there for him.

681
01:04:04,642 --> 01:04:06,609
So was everything
you told me a lie?

682
01:04:07,579 --> 01:04:09,546
Did you even fall off your bike?

683
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:13,319
New Jersey? Matching tattoos?

684
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,422
So what, you You
did all this because

685
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:22,526
you're still in love with him
and he's still in love with you?

686
01:06:08,832 --> 01:06:10,469
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

687
01:06:14,805 --> 01:06:16,013
I just

688
01:06:16,515 --> 01:06:17,740
I needed some time to think.

689
01:06:20,514 --> 01:06:22,118
I got a feeling
it's not about me.

690
01:06:25,321 --> 01:06:26,485
It's complicated, you know?

691
01:06:27,785 --> 01:06:28,784
No.

692
01:06:29,655 --> 01:06:30,654
It's not.

693
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,559
You don't see me.

694
01:06:38,103 --> 01:06:39,135
You don't see me anymore.

695
01:06:42,569 --> 01:06:43,568
Cause you see me?

696
01:06:44,835 --> 01:06:46,043
Yes.

697
01:06:47,343 --> 01:06:48,342
I do.

698
01:06:51,512 --> 01:06:52,511
What do you see?

699
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:55,151
A girl who's not happy.

700
01:06:57,716 --> 01:06:59,353
Because her happiness
is somewhere else.

701
01:07:13,864 --> 01:07:15,072
Where have you been?

702
01:07:17,571 --> 01:07:18,570
What's going on, Vivien?

703
01:07:22,411 --> 01:07:24,444
Can we please talk about it?
Tell me what's going on!

704
01:07:24,879 --> 01:07:26,182
Please, just talk to me!

705
01:07:26,877 --> 01:07:28,844
Viv! What did she tell you?

706
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:32,188
You lied to me.

707
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:34,586
You acted like
she was a complete stranger,

708
01:07:34,621 --> 01:07:37,292
you acted like you
didn't know her at all!

709
01:07:37,327 --> 01:07:39,228
She was acting like
she didn't know me!

710
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:40,592
I was just trying to avoid her!

711
01:07:40,627 --> 01:07:42,396
I figured out it was the best
thing to do!

712
01:07:42,965 --> 01:07:44,398
Did you fuck her at that party?

713
01:07:44,433 --> 01:07:46,103
No! I would never fuck her!

714
01:07:46,338 --> 01:07:48,105
Whatever happened between us,
we were just kids!

715
01:07:48,707 --> 01:07:49,766
- Right.
- It was years ago!

716
01:07:50,435 --> 01:07:54,276
New Jersey and getting
matching tattoos together,

717
01:07:54,311 --> 01:07:56,608
that all happened
a really long time ago, right?

718
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:58,577
Viv. We grew up together.

719
01:07:58,612 --> 01:08:00,612
She's obsessed with me,
she cannot let it go!

720
01:08:01,147 --> 01:08:02,845
But I already told her
a thousand times.

721
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,320
I don't care about her,
I don't care!

722
01:08:06,521 --> 01:08:07,850
Please. Just give me some time.

723
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,328
Just give me a moment, like
Let's talk about it.

724
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:16,166
You had plenty of
time to talk about it.

725
01:08:17,268 --> 01:08:18,267
Let me go.

726
01:08:18,599 --> 01:08:19,664
Why?

727
01:08:20,469 --> 01:08:21,568
Why what?

728
01:08:21,604 --> 01:08:24,339
Why would you rather believe
a total stranger than me?

729
01:08:26,343 --> 01:08:29,608
- Maybe there's something else!
- Oh! Like what?

730
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,447
Like you don't care
that much about me.

731
01:08:33,482 --> 01:08:35,185
You just wanna go home.

732
01:08:35,654 --> 01:08:37,649
First you tell me that I have to
follow my dreams,

733
01:08:37,684 --> 01:08:39,519
that I have to do the show.

734
01:08:39,554 --> 01:08:42,621
And now you're finding any
excuse to go back to New Jersey!

735
01:08:44,823 --> 01:08:46,790
And where is your home, Roy?

736
01:08:53,766 --> 01:08:54,831
You gave up on us.

737
01:08:55,801 --> 01:08:57,306
The moment you lied to me.

738
01:09:05,778 --> 01:09:07,349
Viv Viv, Viv, Viv, Viv!

739
01:09:08,814 --> 01:09:10,451
I meant it when I
asked you to marry me.

740
01:09:11,652 --> 01:09:13,223
I love you so much.

741
01:09:15,887 --> 01:09:16,919
Please don't go.

742
01:11:30,153 --> 01:11:31,526
I did it to save her.

743
01:11:32,628 --> 01:11:33,660
I never told anyone.

744
01:11:35,499 --> 01:11:36,795
So, that girl was Anna.

745
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:40,799
Yes.

746
01:11:41,201 --> 01:11:43,802
It's all my fault. I
destroyed the barn.

747
01:11:44,137 --> 01:11:45,342
Stop it!

748
01:11:45,711 --> 01:11:48,103
You didn't destroy anything.
You saved her life.

749
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:50,611
And that's the best thing
you could have done.

750
01:11:59,116 --> 01:12:00,654
What What are you doing?

751
01:12:00,689 --> 01:12:01,820
You helped me with the show.

752
01:12:02,289 --> 01:12:05,120
And I wanna try to
rebuild something.

753
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:07,694
Starting with the old house.

754
01:12:09,434 --> 01:12:10,499
If that's okay with you.

755
01:12:10,534 --> 01:12:13,502
Okay. Oh

756
01:12:21,171 --> 01:12:23,138
You want her here,
with you, don't you?

757
01:12:25,043 --> 01:12:27,142
- Yeah.
- Then why did you let her go?

758
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:35,755
I don't wanna stand in her way.

759
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:38,758
How about getting
out of your own way?

760
01:12:39,527 --> 01:12:42,663
This pain you're feeling,
do something with it.

761
01:12:47,703 --> 01:12:48,735
Thank you.

762
01:14:03,009 --> 01:14:04,976
Hey. What's up?

763
01:14:05,847 --> 01:14:06,846
What are you doing here?

764
01:14:07,415 --> 01:14:09,211
I can't show these
pictures anymore.

765
01:14:10,819 --> 01:14:12,984
Come on, man. What do you mean?

766
01:14:13,186 --> 01:14:15,525
Everything's ready,
the opening is tomorrow!

767
01:14:16,461 --> 01:14:18,858
I just can't! These photos
don't represent me!

768
01:14:19,564 --> 01:14:20,596
They're not me!

769
01:14:20,631 --> 01:14:22,191
Look, you're just nervous.

770
01:14:22,493 --> 01:14:23,962
Everything will be fine.

771
01:14:24,965 --> 01:14:26,536
These are the wrong pictures.

772
01:14:26,571 --> 01:14:28,263
Roy, we're all set to go.

773
01:14:29,101 --> 01:14:30,232
We don't have the time.

774
01:14:32,203 --> 01:14:33,235
We have all night.

775
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:35,809
Please.

776
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:47,183
Hey. Do you want some coffee?

777
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,823
No I'm I'm fine, thank you.

778
01:14:50,225 --> 01:14:51,286
Are you sure? That's fresh.

779
01:14:52,190 --> 01:14:53,189
Yeah, really. I'm fine.

780
01:14:58,163 --> 01:14:59,569
I remember you.

781
01:15:01,232 --> 01:15:03,738
You wouldn't remember me.
You were too young.

782
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:11,746
I'm I'm looking
for Roy, is he here?

783
01:15:13,343 --> 01:15:15,585
No. He's at the gallery.

784
01:15:16,321 --> 01:15:18,016
He and Thomas haven't
come back yet.

785
01:15:18,051 --> 01:15:20,590
It happens a lot
the night before an opening.

786
01:15:24,354 --> 01:15:25,562
Must be really hard.

787
01:15:29,865 --> 01:15:30,765
What?

788
01:15:31,262 --> 01:15:32,294
Letting him go.

789
01:15:36,707 --> 01:15:37,904
Yeah.

790
01:15:38,806 --> 01:15:42,579
Sometimes, we have to suffer
for the good of other people.

791
01:15:44,275 --> 01:15:48,849
In the long run maybe we
realize it's better for us too.

792
01:18:55,565 --> 01:18:56,971
What are you doing here?

793
01:18:59,173 --> 01:18:59,974
Waiting for you.

794
01:19:04,882 --> 01:19:05,881
I'm

795
01:19:06,583 --> 01:19:08,378
I'm sorry, I just
didn't realize.

796
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:10,787
What?

797
01:19:11,614 --> 01:19:12,954
How much you care about her.

798
01:19:14,254 --> 01:19:15,253
Now I know.

799
01:19:16,487 --> 01:19:17,519
It's too late for that.

800
01:19:19,490 --> 01:19:21,325
It's never too late
for someone you love.

801
01:19:21,894 --> 01:19:23,294
Look, Anna, I haven't slept.

802
01:19:23,329 --> 01:19:25,131
I still have to choose
the last photos and

803
01:19:25,933 --> 01:19:27,969
I turned everything upside down
last night.

804
01:19:29,434 --> 01:19:30,840
Why did you do all this?

805
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:34,140
I'll tell you why,
you did it for her.

806
01:19:36,474 --> 01:19:38,474
But it won't do you any good
if she can't see it.

807
01:19:41,446 --> 01:19:42,852
Why don't you go to her?

808
01:19:45,516 --> 01:19:46,823
She doesn't want me anymore.

809
01:19:48,651 --> 01:19:50,959
Well, did you try everything
you could to get her back?

810
01:19:53,458 --> 01:19:54,457
No, you didn't.

811
01:19:55,159 --> 01:19:57,933
You'll never forgive yourself
if you don't get her back.

812
01:19:59,266 --> 01:20:00,562
I know this because

813
01:20:00,597 --> 01:20:03,037
I did everything I could
to get you back.

814
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:06,106
And it's your turn now.

815
01:20:08,308 --> 01:20:09,604
We just have to learn to fly.

816
01:20:11,982 --> 01:20:13,344
I mean, you taught
me that, remember?

817
01:20:18,186 --> 01:20:19,218
She'll never forgive me.

818
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:22,023
Roy, if you forgave me,

819
01:20:22,058 --> 01:20:24,058
I don't see why
she wouldn't forgive you.

820
01:20:33,168 --> 01:20:34,200
Now go.

821
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:37,874
Go!

822
01:21:38,167 --> 01:21:39,100
You can't leave now.

823
01:21:39,135 --> 01:21:41,399
My flight leaves in
an hour, I have to go.

824
01:21:45,174 --> 01:21:47,273
You don't have to go,
you can stay here with me.

825
01:21:47,608 --> 01:21:48,703
I can't stay here with you.

826
01:21:50,443 --> 01:21:53,279
I have things to do, I have
something important to me.

827
01:21:53,781 --> 01:21:54,984
Does that matter?

828
01:21:55,646 --> 01:21:56,986
Obviously matters.

829
01:22:00,156 --> 01:22:01,254
I don't think it does!

830
01:22:04,754 --> 01:22:06,226
I came here for you!

831
01:22:09,297 --> 01:22:12,100
So you could sell the farmhouse,
money for school

832
01:22:12,135 --> 01:22:13,431
and now you change
your all mind!

833
01:22:13,933 --> 01:22:15,400
Now you want
something different!

834
01:22:15,835 --> 01:22:18,106
Every single time you want
something different,

835
01:22:18,141 --> 01:22:19,107
I never know!

836
01:22:20,638 --> 01:22:21,736
One minute you want one thing,

837
01:22:21,771 --> 01:22:24,112
the next minute something else.

838
01:22:24,147 --> 01:22:25,740
I'm always here
trying to play catch up!

839
01:22:35,752 --> 01:22:37,356
Vivien, wait, wait, wait.

840
01:22:37,624 --> 01:22:39,358
- Listen to me.
- Why would I wait?

841
01:22:39,793 --> 01:22:40,726
Why would I listen?

842
01:22:40,761 --> 01:22:43,593
Every single time I
listen, you lie to me!

843
01:22:43,628 --> 01:22:45,496
Every single time!

844
01:22:48,798 --> 01:22:50,006
Look into my eyes.

845
01:22:52,637 --> 01:22:53,636
I know I lied to you.

846
01:22:55,673 --> 01:22:59,147
I didn't want to hurt you
and I've messed that up so bad.

847
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,545
I messed up everything.

848
01:23:03,813 --> 01:23:04,779
This time, I won't.

849
01:23:09,522 --> 01:23:12,160
Just give me one hour.
I need one hour of your time.

849
01:23:13,305 --> 01:24:13,341
