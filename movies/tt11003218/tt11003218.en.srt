00:02:32,714 --> 00:02:34,351
Come on.

4
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:41,886
There you go.

5
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:12,950
Come on.

6
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,590
Have a truffle, girl.

7
00:04:18,985 --> 00:04:20,589
Good find, girl.

8
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,986
Oh, boy.

9
00:06:35,055 --> 00:06:37,154
Excuse me.

10
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:40,861
No. No, fuck off.

11
00:06:40,896 --> 00:06:41,928
Get away from my car.

12
00:06:41,963 --> 00:06:45,162
Go, go. Come on.

13
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,131
No, no, not me, either.

14
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,706
What's up, old man?

15
00:06:54,811 --> 00:06:56,415
Oh, wow.

16
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:01,145
Beautiful.

17
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,723
Woo.

18
00:07:07,758 --> 00:07:10,022
I don't know how this
little fucker does it.

19
00:07:10,057 --> 00:07:11,463
How do you do it?

20
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:16,798
You sure you don't want
one of those,

21
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,899
um, camp showers,

22
00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:20,197
you know,
the ones with the propane

23
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:23,200
and the hot water?

24
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,741
What about that phone?

25
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:27,006
I don't wanna be
the one to drive up

26
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,746
and find you, like dead.

27
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:32,946
You know, there's, like,
animals and shit out here.

28
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:39,854
Okay.

29
00:07:42,155 --> 00:07:43,561
Oh.

30
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,226
Good talk, Rob.

31
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,964
See you next Thursday, asshole.

32
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:44,083

33
00:08:44,118 --> 00:08:47,757

34
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:50,155
<i>Get out, get out, it's just...
I'm trying to surprise you.</i>

35
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,058
<i>I'm trying... I'm...</i>

36
00:09:16,821 --> 00:09:18,018
I'm okay.

37
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:35,002
It's just coyotes.
Back to bed, girl.

38
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:26,757
Hey, hey.

39
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:33,357
It's just coyotes.

40
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:39,737
That's it, go to bed.

41
00:10:50,211 --> 00:10:54,950
Go inside! Go!
Get it. Get it!

42
00:10:54,985 --> 00:10:56,380
I got it, I got it, I got it.

43
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:06,192
- Let her go!
- Oh, my God!

44
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:10,933
Hey!

45
00:11:15,368 --> 00:11:18,875
No. No. No.

46
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:24,351
Can I help you?

47
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:30,390
Is...

48
00:15:32,262 --> 00:15:34,031
Marge here?

49
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:37,694
Marge died 10 years ago.

50
00:15:40,303 --> 00:15:41,500
Oh.

51
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:46,736
Do you have a phone?

52
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:49,277
Are you gonna order something?

53
00:15:49,312 --> 00:15:51,444
No.

54
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,093
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

55
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,622
Thank you.

56
00:16:04,657 --> 00:16:06,393
You fucker.

57
00:16:18,506 --> 00:16:21,606
Whoa, that hurt?

58
00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:28,184
Listen, man.

59
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:31,187
You know this isn't, like,
my problem, right?

60
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:37,358
You want your supply,
I need my pig.

61

How's it going, Mac?

73
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,504
- Yo.
- Mac?

74
00:17:34,384 --> 00:17:35,680
You know, I don't like

75
00:17:35,715 --> 00:17:37,583
buyers coming out to the site.

76
00:17:37,618 --> 00:17:39,651
Yeah, hey, Mac. Sorry.

77
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:41,818
I'm just, um...

78
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,523
um, uh, we're just looking

79
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:45,624
for that couple
with the green pickup.

80
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:48,132
Turquoise.

81
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,827
You got a little somethin'.

82
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:53,566
Uh, they haven't been around
for a few weeks.

83
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:54,798
What'd they do?

84
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,438
Nothing.
Just a little misunderstanding

85
00:17:57,473 --> 00:17:58,538
we gotta get sorted out.

86
00:17:58,573 --> 00:18:01,112
They took my pig.

87
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,410
What kind of pig?

88
00:18:04,282 --> 00:18:05,479
It's a truffle pig.

89
00:18:05,514 --> 00:18:07,250
Motherfucker!

90
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:08,713
Wicky, you take over.

91
00:18:08,748 --> 00:18:11,254
Anyone fucks with Wicky,
I'll break your fingers.

92
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:12,321
Motherfuckers!

93
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:29,305
I expect certain things

94
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,472
from the people
I do business with.

95
00:18:31,507 --> 00:18:33,144
I think that's reasonable.

96
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,146
Yeah. We appreciate that, Mac.

97
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,774
- We really do appreciate it.
- Uh-hmm.

98
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:38,677
You've been digging my sites.

99
00:18:38,712 --> 00:18:40,481
No. No, no, no.
We wouldn't do that.

100
00:18:40,516 --> 00:18:43,286
This guy comes telling me
you took his pig.

101
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:44,518
That means you're poaching.

102
00:18:44,553 --> 00:18:45,849
Okay. Listen.

103
00:18:45,884 --> 00:18:47,455
We don't even have
the pig anymore, okay?

104
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,259
- I mean, I swear...
- Who has it?

105
00:18:51,626 --> 00:18:52,790
I don't know.

106
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,399
Did you see him?

107
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:02,239
I didn't get like
a fucking ID or...

108
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,374
it was just some guy
with money and...

109
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:07,607
- Rich?
- Um, he came to us.

110
00:19:07,642 --> 00:19:09,213
Oh, he drove a nice car.

111
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,610
What kind of car
did he drive in?

112
00:19:10,645 --> 00:19:12,348
Black.

113
00:19:12,383 --> 00:19:15,285
It was... it was waxy.

114
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,882
It was just some city guy.
I don't... I don't know.

115
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:29,794
So I guess that's it?
Just find a new one?

116
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:31,730
Another pig can't do
what she did.

117
00:19:31,765 --> 00:19:33,237
I don't know, man. Get a...

118
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,931
get a good trainer
or something.

119
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:36,801
You lose a season
while I train a pig

120
00:19:36,836 --> 00:19:38,440
that'll never be as good?

121
00:19:49,618 --> 00:19:50,815
Take me to the city.

122
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,850
What?

123
00:19:52,885 --> 00:19:54,522
A city guy.

124
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,657
What are you gonna do,
knock on every

125
00:19:57,692 --> 00:19:58,955
fuckin' door in Portland?

126
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,430
I might know someone

127
00:20:01,465 --> 00:20:02,728
who knows the industry.

128
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,797
You might...

129
00:20:05,832 --> 00:20:09,240
I... I'm not taking you
to the fucking city, okay?

130
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,637
That's where I do my business.

131
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,476
Are you afraid?

132
00:20:19,648 --> 00:20:22,011
Listen, what I do
is all about my reputation.

133
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:23,848
- People talk.
- People talk?

134
00:20:23,883 --> 00:20:25,718
- Yeah.
- People talk.

135
00:20:25,753 --> 00:20:26,785
Stop saying that.

136
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,392
You like this car?

137
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:31,889
You like that shirt?

138
00:20:35,796 --> 00:20:36,960
Shut up.

139
00:21:38,023 --> 00:21:40,496
Yo.

140
00:21:40,531 --> 00:21:41,629
Is this the spot?

141
00:21:44,898 --> 00:21:46,403
I need $10.

142
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:50,374

Have you heard anything
about a pig?

148
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:14,458
I remember a time
when your name

149
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,921
meant something
to people, Robin.

150
00:23:17,793 --> 00:23:20,156
But now...

151
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:21,663
you have no value.

152
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:29,407
You don't even exist anymore.

153
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,613
You don't exist.

154
00:24:00,836 --> 00:24:02,539
You even know his real name?

155
00:24:12,177 --> 00:24:14,749
Open the door.

156
00:24:14,784 --> 00:24:15,816
How do you know that guy?

157
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,216
Rob, how do you know him?

158
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,789
I used to live around here.

159
00:24:24,057 --> 00:24:25,496
Was that Edgar?

160
00:24:27,093 --> 00:24:28,598
How do you know Edgar?

161
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,962
What time is it?

162
00:24:29,997 --> 00:24:31,931
- What?
- I don't have a watch.

163
00:24:31,966 --> 00:24:34,230
Oh, shocker.

164
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:35,506
It's 9:15.

165
00:24:37,906 --> 00:24:39,235
What are we doing?

166
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,841
We're waiting until 12:00.

167
00:24:55,055 --> 00:24:56,285
Oh, shit!

168
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,924
Just you... yeah, you go.

169
00:25:04,097 --> 00:25:05,162
Go away.

170
00:25:05,197 --> 00:25:07,835
I need to go inside.

171
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,639
We don't have a bathroom.

172
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,102
- I'm having a night out...
- Don't tell him my name,

173
00:25:11,137 --> 00:25:13,038
- ...with my friend.
- You stupid asshole.

174
00:25:13,073 --> 00:25:14,545
- What is it?
- Amir?

175
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,780
- Fucking kill me...
- Amir! Yo!

176
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:24,819
Dave? What's up, my dude?

177
00:25:24,854 --> 00:25:26,986
I didn't know
you were working tonight.

178
00:25:27,021 --> 00:25:30,088
Yeah. Is this guy with you?

179
00:25:30,123 --> 00:25:33,663
Hey, listen,
he's my dad's friend.

180
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,324
I'm just showing him around
and we're just...

181
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:37,029
- Just whatever, man.
- He's Buddhist.

182
00:25:37,064 --> 00:25:39,669
I don't care.

183
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,777
Do you even know
where we're going?

184
00:25:48,812 --> 00:25:50,009
Rob!

185
00:25:50,044 --> 00:25:51,714
We're going
to the Hotel Portland.

186
00:25:51,749 --> 00:25:53,309
What?

187
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:55,685
What hotel? What...

188
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,818
The Hotel Portland.

189
00:25:56,853 --> 00:25:58,182
I know this city.

190
00:25:58,217 --> 00:26:01,020
There is no such thing
as a Hotel Portland.

191
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,122
I'm sticking my neck out.

192
00:26:04,157 --> 00:26:06,322
And we're in my city now,
so you have to...

193
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:08,060
you know,
you gotta keep me in the loop.

194
00:26:08,095 --> 00:26:10,260
There is no loop.
We're finding my pig.

195
00:26:10,295 --> 00:26:13,703
You're not part of a loop.
You're my ride.

196
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,331
Fuck you, man!

197
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:17,168
You're just a fucking
homeless asshole

198
00:26:17,203 --> 00:26:18,873
who probably fucks his pig.

199
00:26:18,908 --> 00:26:21,106
I'm so sick of your shit!

200
00:26:21,141 --> 00:26:23,141
Do you know what you're worth
to me without that pig?

201
00:26:23,176 --> 00:26:25,242
Nothing. Fucking zero!

202
00:26:25,277 --> 00:26:27,277
You're gonna have
a fucking stroke in that cabin,

203
00:26:27,312 --> 00:26:30,082
and I'm gonna be the only one
that fucking notices.

204
00:26:30,117 --> 00:26:33,921
So how about try and give me
some fucking respect?

205
00:26:33,956 --> 00:26:36,792
I don't fuck my pig.

206
00:26:39,423 --> 00:26:42,193
Fuck this, man!
I am fucking outta here.

207
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,333
The hotel was torn down
back in the '50s.

208
00:26:52,942 --> 00:26:54,612
Now it's Pioneer Square.

209
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:59,617
But they just covered up
the subbasement, so...

210
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:04,083
it's all still there
under the park.

211
00:27:04,118 --> 00:27:07,350
- What?
- Now it's Edgar's place.

212
00:27:07,385 --> 00:27:10,089
That's where we're going.

213
00:27:10,124 --> 00:27:12,058
Now you're in the loop.

214
00:27:13,325 --> 00:27:14,665
Help me.

215
00:27:30,045 --> 00:27:33,409
Whatever happens,
just stay back.

216
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,279
What does that mean?

217
00:27:35,314 --> 00:27:37,281
What's "whatever?"

218
00:27:37,316 --> 00:27:39,151
Rob?

219
00:27:39,186 --> 00:27:41,417
It's dusty.

220
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:44,288
Leave that off.
Your eyes will adjust.

221
00:27:48,426 --> 00:27:51,064
Edgar's been running fights
for restaurant workers

222
00:27:51,099 --> 00:27:52,736
for 30 years.

223
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:56,465
If your name means something,
they'll bid high.

224
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,302
That's all he sees.

225
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,207
How do you know that?

226
00:28:08,281 --> 00:28:10,314
Who are you?

227
00:28:36,309 --> 00:28:40,146
Ten seconds.
That is 500 bucks for Dennis.

228
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,414
And next up, we've got...

229
00:30:27,057 --> 00:30:28,485
Oh, my God.

230
00:31:04,358 --> 00:31:09,097
<i>♪ I don't know if ♪</i>

231
00:31:09,132 --> 00:31:14,069
<i>♪ We're in the garden ♪</i>

232
00:32:57,174 --> 00:32:58,635
I'm looking...

233
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:02,177
for my pig.

234
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,685
Sorry.
I don't cook very much.

235
00:34:59,395 --> 00:35:01,296
You know the place?

236
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,762
Finway's?

237
00:35:05,797 --> 00:35:08,666
Yeah, it's hot.

238
00:35:08,701 --> 00:35:11,141
Can you get a reservation
for lunch?

239
00:35:12,606 --> 00:35:14,474
Sure. Yeah.

240
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:31,458
You know, when I was a kid,

241
00:35:34,892 --> 00:35:36,727
my parents used to do this...

242
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:40,434
date night thing.

243
00:35:40,469 --> 00:35:42,535
I mean, not a lot,

244
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,900
my dad was really busy.

245
00:35:46,409 --> 00:35:48,574
They'd usually come back

246
00:35:48,609 --> 00:35:50,444
fighting and screaming
at each other.

247
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:52,380
And my mom would get all...

248
00:35:53,482 --> 00:35:55,812
mopey.

249
00:35:55,847 --> 00:35:58,419
But...

250
00:35:58,454 --> 00:36:00,289
this one night...

251
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:04,359
I remember...

252
00:36:04,394 --> 00:36:06,328
going to this restaurant and...

253
00:36:07,826 --> 00:36:09,859
they came back,

254
00:36:09,894 --> 00:36:12,598
and they were so happy.

255
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:14,831
Like, they were smiling

256
00:36:14,866 --> 00:36:18,472
and talking about the food
and the wine

257
00:36:18,507 --> 00:36:21,904
and really, really,
really drunk.

258
00:36:23,545 --> 00:36:27,745
They talked about that meal
for years.

259
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,813
Even after the chef,

260
00:36:29,848 --> 00:36:31,881
this huge chef,

261
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:34,851
just disappeared.

262
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:39,295
That was your spot.

263
00:36:41,563 --> 00:36:44,894
People still talk about it,
you know?

264
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:48,469
It's probably the only time
I remember my mom, like...

265
00:36:54,774 --> 00:36:56,576
What happened to her?

266
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:01,581
She's...

267
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:05,750
Um, she killed herself.

268
00:37:08,854 --> 00:37:10,854
She was...

269
00:37:10,889 --> 00:37:12,790
she was never like...

270
00:37:14,992 --> 00:37:17,564
when you're like that,

271
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,995
it's just it's gonna happen
sooner or later.

272
00:37:21,966 --> 00:37:24,340
My dad was...

273
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:27,640
he was always the tough one

274
00:37:27,675 --> 00:37:29,576
in the family.

275
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:31,974
So, his business is bomb.

276
00:37:35,749 --> 00:37:39,289
I mean, he's not going anywhere
anytime soon.

277
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:40,653
He's very...

278
00:37:42,492 --> 00:37:45,559
he's very with it,

279
00:37:45,594 --> 00:37:47,693
know what I mean?

280
00:37:47,728 --> 00:37:49,497
He's locked in.

281
00:37:52,931 --> 00:37:54,568
Motherfucker.

282
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,310
We don't...

283
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,282
have to care.

284
00:38:07,814 --> 00:38:11,420
People first came out here

285
00:38:12,852 --> 00:38:15,688
10,000 years ago...

286
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:24,466
we would've been
under 400 feet of water.

287
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:29,603
Every 200 years,

288
00:38:29,638 --> 00:38:31,506
we get an earthquake,

289
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:33,002
right along the coast.

290
00:38:34,775 --> 00:38:36,412
One's coming up.

291
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:44,585
When the shockwave hits,

292
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,885
most of the city will flatten.

293
00:38:49,988 --> 00:38:53,792
Every bridge will fall

294
00:38:55,026 --> 00:38:57,092
into the Willamette,

295
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:58,599
so...

296
00:39:00,867 --> 00:39:03,670
there's nowhere to go

297
00:39:03,705 --> 00:39:04,836
even if we could.

298
00:39:10,943 --> 00:39:15,814
Anyone who survives
that's just waiting.

299
00:39:18,687 --> 00:39:20,852
Five minutes later,

300
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:24,955
they'll look up

301
00:39:27,861 --> 00:39:31,060
and they'll see a wave

302
00:39:31,095 --> 00:39:33,029
ten stories high.

303
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,577
And then all this, everyone...

304
00:39:45,681 --> 00:39:49,815
it's all gonna be at the bottom
of the ocean.

305
00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:53,148
Again.

306
00:40:01,796 --> 00:40:04,665
You should use stale bread
for French toast.

307
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,738
<i>A tone becomes
musical material</i>

308
00:40:11,773 --> 00:40:14,972
<i>only by association
with another tone.</i>

309
00:40:15,007 --> 00:40:17,007
<i>We might hear it alone,</i>

310
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:18,778
<i>study its quality,</i>

311
00:40:18,813 --> 00:40:20,208
<i>and determine its degree</i>

312
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:22,650
<i>of acuteness or gravity,
but its...</i>

313
00:40:24,654 --> 00:40:27,083
You want that hundred fifty
percent carthusianum?

314
00:40:29,087 --> 00:40:31,186
You come to me.

315
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:32,957
If you want
some bullshit indicum,

316
00:40:32,992 --> 00:40:34,563
then you go to Katie.

317
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,928
You want some shit
that's been sitting in a...

318
00:40:36,963 --> 00:40:38,831
you want some shit
that's been sitting in a cooler

319
00:40:38,866 --> 00:40:40,635
for three days?
Then you go to my father.

320
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,472
But if you want the real thing,

321
00:40:42,507 --> 00:40:44,936
if you want the real thing
then you come to me.

322
00:40:44,971 --> 00:40:47,136
I'm the king of the jungle.

323
00:40:48,711 --> 00:40:50,238
Hey, you're buddies
with the sous-chef

324
00:40:50,273 --> 00:40:52,878
- over at Finway's, right?
- How many grams are we at?

325
00:40:52,913 --> 00:40:54,242
Uh, 220.

326
00:40:54,277 --> 00:40:56,145
- That's close enough.
- Cool. So, um...

327
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,817
Hey, Jess will get you
on the way out, all right?

328
00:40:57,852 --> 00:40:59,555
Right. Awesome. Um...

329
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,052
you are friends
with Finway's guy, right?

330
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:04,153
- Yeah.
- Sweet. Sweet.

331
00:41:04,188 --> 00:41:06,122
Yo, you think you could, like,

332
00:41:06,157 --> 00:41:08,531
score me a res
for lunch today or...

333
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,533
You know that's your dad's spot.

334
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,095
Yeah. No, I... I mean, I know.

335
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,097
It's just like... it's fine.

336
00:41:14,132 --> 00:41:15,670
He knows. It's cool.
I'm not there for business.

337
00:41:15,705 --> 00:41:17,232
I'm just...
I have a friend in town.

338
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:19,509
Anyway, you know how busy
they are this time of year?

339
00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:21,137
For sure.
For sure. But...

340
00:41:21,172 --> 00:41:23,843
I mean, you got
like mad ins there, so.

341
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:28,177
Come on.

342
00:41:28,212 --> 00:41:29,651
Hey.

343
00:41:29,686 --> 00:41:31,246
Half off.

344
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:33,116
No.

345
00:41:33,151 --> 00:41:34,854
My friend is Robin Feld.

346
00:43:12,987 --> 00:43:14,723
That sounds nice.

347
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,285
What is it?

348
00:43:18,025 --> 00:43:20,058
It's called a handpan.

349
00:43:21,831 --> 00:43:23,600
Wanna try it?

350
00:43:51,223 --> 00:43:54,191
Does your face hurt?

351
00:43:54,226 --> 00:43:55,962
Yeah.

352
00:43:59,198 --> 00:44:01,165
Thanks.

353
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,035
What's your name?

354
00:44:06,238 --> 00:44:08,007
I'm Rob.

355
00:44:10,143 --> 00:44:12,242
I used to live here.

356
00:44:16,853 --> 00:44:19,788
What happened
to the persimmon tree?

357
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,922
What's a persimmon?

358
00:44:23,486 --> 00:44:25,222
It's a, uh...

359
00:44:26,896 --> 00:44:29,963
it's an orange fruit.

360
00:44:29,998 --> 00:44:31,932
Looks kind of like a tomato.

361
00:44:35,938 --> 00:44:40,303
You... you can't eat it
if it's not ripe.

362
00:44:40,338 --> 00:44:42,745
It's awful.

363
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,110
But...

364
00:44:45,145 --> 00:44:46,441
if you give it time,

365
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:50,412
it gets rid of these things
called tannins,

366
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,690
and then they're very good.

367
00:44:56,288 --> 00:44:59,388
I don't think
we have a persimmon tree.

368
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:02,028
No?

369
00:45:04,362 --> 00:45:05,966
That's okay.

370
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,806
Did it die?

371
00:45:25,284 --> 00:45:28,120
<i>We all have
a set of held beliefs</i>

372
00:45:28,155 --> 00:45:30,254
<i>about the world around us.</i>

373
00:45:30,289 --> 00:45:31,959
<i>To challenge them</i>

374
00:45:31,994 --> 00:45:35,325
<i>is to acknowledge
our foundation is sand,</i>

375
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,328
<i>but it opens us up
to something greater.</i>

376
00:45:38,363 --> 00:45:40,198
<i>To pure connection.</i>

377
00:45:40,233 --> 00:45:42,332
<i>To true life.</i>

378
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:45,775
Today's journey begins
by uniting the depths of the sea

379
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,337
with the riches of our forests.

380
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:50,241
We've emulsified
locally sourced scallops

381
00:45:50,276 --> 00:45:53,343
encased in a flash-frozen
seawater roe blend,

382
00:45:53,378 --> 00:45:56,280
on a bed of foraged
huckleberry foam,

383
00:45:56,315 --> 00:45:57,919
all bathed in the smoke

384
00:45:57,954 --> 00:46:00,823
from Douglas fir cones.

385
00:46:13,464 --> 00:46:15,937
I'd like to speak to the chef.

386
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,505
Listen, man, can we try
to keep a low profile?

387
00:46:24,981 --> 00:46:26,178
My dad sells to this place.

388
00:46:26,213 --> 00:46:28,851
I'm not really
supposed to be in here.

389
00:46:30,052 --> 00:46:31,282
Sorry.

390
00:46:33,253 --> 00:46:34,549
It's okay.

391
00:46:36,091 --> 00:46:37,453
Why?

392
00:46:39,061 --> 00:46:41,259
Why what?

393
00:46:41,294 --> 00:46:43,591
Why aren't you
supposed to be in here?

394
00:46:43,626 --> 00:46:45,461
Oh, that's nice.

395
00:46:45,496 --> 00:46:47,562
You know, we just have a thing.

396
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:50,840
We don't step
on each other's sales.

397
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:53,502
I've got my business
and he's got his.

398
00:46:53,537 --> 00:46:55,537
Why don't you work for him?

399
00:46:57,079 --> 00:46:59,079
I will one day, you know,

400
00:46:59,114 --> 00:47:01,279
when I'm more established.

401
00:47:04,086 --> 00:47:06,086
Your dad sounds terrible.

402
00:47:06,121 --> 00:47:09,089
Well, you know,

403
00:47:09,124 --> 00:47:10,354
can't all live in the woods.

404
00:47:10,389 --> 00:47:12,059
I mean, it sounds like

405
00:47:12,094 --> 00:47:14,127
he's not very supportive.

406
00:47:14,162 --> 00:47:17,460
Well, he knows
that I can make it on my own.

407
00:47:17,495 --> 00:47:19,836
You know, in this business,
you got to...

408
00:47:21,664 --> 00:47:24,973
You got to...

409
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,943
you know, I don't need help.
I don't need his help.

410
00:47:32,609 --> 00:47:34,543
Let me do the talking, okay?

411
00:47:34,578 --> 00:47:36,578
- Okay.
- Hi, I'm Chef Finway.

412
00:47:36,613 --> 00:47:38,217
Welcome to Eurydice.

413
00:47:38,252 --> 00:47:41,154
- Food is really good.
- Well, thank you.

414
00:47:41,189 --> 00:47:44,157
Thank you.
I'm so glad you're enjoying it.

415
00:47:44,192 --> 00:47:47,061
Um, we heard there were some

416
00:47:47,096 --> 00:47:49,932
new truffles on the menu?

417
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:52,495
Well, we are planning
a few truffle dishes

418
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:54,167
for the winter menu.

419
00:47:54,202 --> 00:47:56,103
It's... it's a...
it's a fascinating

420
00:47:56,138 --> 00:47:59,304
and expanding local industry
with deep roots

421
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:02,043
in old-world, uh, traditions.

422
00:48:02,078 --> 00:48:03,605
Great.

423
00:48:06,346 --> 00:48:07,510
Um...

424
00:48:09,954 --> 00:48:11,888
I'm looking for a truffle pig.

425
00:48:14,618 --> 00:48:16,090
I don't...

426
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:17,421
I, uh, I don't understand.

427
00:48:17,456 --> 00:48:19,654
I just wanna know about the pig.

428
00:48:22,461 --> 00:48:23,900
Tell him who you are.

429
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:28,234
Come on. Tell him.

430
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:47,154
Chef Feld?

431
00:48:48,586 --> 00:48:50,960
Oh, my God. Uh, may I?

432
00:48:52,689 --> 00:48:54,359
Uh, how are you?

433
00:48:54,394 --> 00:48:56,328
My God. You... you... you've been
off the scene for what,

434
00:48:56,363 --> 00:48:58,693
- uh, 10 years?
- Fifteen.

435
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:00,530
Really? Okay.

436
00:49:00,565 --> 00:49:03,104
I thought you were...
um, well, I mean,

437
00:49:03,139 --> 00:49:05,238
- the time is very, uh...
- Sure.

438
00:49:05,273 --> 00:49:07,537
Yeah.

439
00:49:07,572 --> 00:49:09,572
I'm sorry,
do you need medical attention?

440
00:49:09,607 --> 00:49:11,178
No. Thank you.

441
00:49:11,213 --> 00:49:13,312
Uh, you probably
don't remember me,

442
00:49:13,347 --> 00:49:15,413
but I actually worked at Hestia.

443
00:49:15,448 --> 00:49:17,745
You were a prep cook
for two months.

444
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,483
Was it two months?

445
00:49:19,518 --> 00:49:22,486
I fired you because
you always overcooked the pasta.

446
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:29,097
Ah, ah, now, this is excellent.

447
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,199
This is a, uh, a 2012 Pinot

448
00:49:32,234 --> 00:49:34,267
from just 20 miles away.

449
00:49:37,602 --> 00:49:39,206
So do you know about the pig?

450
00:49:40,407 --> 00:49:41,736
Uh, why... why do you want a pig?

451
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:44,013
It's my pig.

452
00:49:44,048 --> 00:49:45,443
Oh, okay.

453
00:49:45,478 --> 00:49:47,214
Uh, that... that... that's great.

454
00:49:47,249 --> 00:49:48,776
That's a... that's a...
that's a great business.

455
00:49:48,811 --> 00:49:51,020
It's a... it's a...
it's an expanding industry.

456
00:49:51,055 --> 00:49:53,187
- It's... it's...
- Someone stole it.

457
00:49:57,787 --> 00:50:01,327
I really, um,

458
00:50:01,362 --> 00:50:03,362
I respect you, Chef,
I always have.

459
00:50:03,397 --> 00:50:05,166
But I'm running a business here

460
00:50:05,201 --> 00:50:08,433
and people have expectations,

461
00:50:08,468 --> 00:50:13,207
uh, critics,
uh, investors, so forth.

462
00:50:13,242 --> 00:50:15,770
And, uh, truffles
are-are-are-are a key part

463
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:19,180
of the whole, uh, concept
of the winter menu

464
00:50:19,215 --> 00:50:23,184
and... and they need to be
the top of the line.

465
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:25,252
So you understand.

466
00:50:25,287 --> 00:50:27,518
I... I have... I have
the utmost respect for you,

467
00:50:27,553 --> 00:50:29,025
utmost.

468
00:50:39,796 --> 00:50:42,335
What is the...

469
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:44,172
concept here?

470
00:50:48,277 --> 00:50:50,343
Um, well, uh,

471
00:50:50,378 --> 00:50:53,346
we're interested
in taking local ingredients,

472
00:50:53,381 --> 00:50:54,842
uh, native to this region

473
00:50:54,877 --> 00:50:57,383
and... and just
deconstructing them,

474
00:50:57,418 --> 00:51:01,585
you know, making
the... the familiar feel foreign,

475
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,257
thereby giving us, uh,

476
00:51:03,292 --> 00:51:06,491
an even greater appreciation
of food as a whole.

477
00:51:06,526 --> 00:51:08,658
This is the kind
of cooking you like?

478
00:51:08,693 --> 00:51:10,330
It's cutting-edge,

479
00:51:10,365 --> 00:51:12,827
- it's very exciting.
- Exciting.

480
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:14,730
Uh, I mean, everybody loves it.

481
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,473
You like cooking it?

482
00:51:22,806 --> 00:51:25,477
- Absolutely.
- Derek,

483
00:51:25,512 --> 00:51:29,580
what was it you always
used to talk about opening?

484
00:51:29,615 --> 00:51:31,087
Wasn't it a pub?

485
00:51:33,784 --> 00:51:35,322
Every-everyone loves it here.

486
00:51:35,357 --> 00:51:36,851
It's a... this is a huge success.

487
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:38,820
Why didn't you open your pub?

488
00:51:38,855 --> 00:51:41,493
I... I don't...

489
00:51:41,528 --> 00:51:44,298
I don't know that
I... I really wanted,

490
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:46,762
uh, I mean... I mean, it's such...
that was such a long time ago.

491
00:51:46,797 --> 00:51:49,732
When I fired you, I asked you
what you wanted to do.

492
00:51:49,767 --> 00:51:52,504
You said you have
a few rooms upstairs,

493
00:51:52,539 --> 00:51:55,408
a real English pub.

494
00:51:55,443 --> 00:51:57,410
That... did I... I say that?

495
00:51:57,445 --> 00:52:00,182
- Yes.
- Nobody wants pubs around here.

496
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:04,186
It's a... that's-that's-that's
a terrible investment.

497
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:06,452
What was going to be
your signature dish?

498
00:52:06,487 --> 00:52:09,257
Liver scotch eggs
with a honey curry mustard.

499
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,429
They're not real.

500
00:52:16,464 --> 00:52:18,464
You get that, right?

501
00:52:18,499 --> 00:52:20,763
None of it is real.

502
00:52:20,798 --> 00:52:22,798
The critics aren't real,

503
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:25,438
the customers aren't real

504
00:52:25,473 --> 00:52:29,442
because this isn't real.

505
00:52:29,477 --> 00:52:30,806
You aren't real.

506
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:33,908
What...

507
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:36,284
Okay.

508
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,748
Derek, why do you care
about this people?

509
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,718
They don't care about you,
none of them.

510
00:52:41,753 --> 00:52:44,259
They don't even know you

511
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:46,690
because you haven't shown them.

512
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:50,364
Every day you wake up

513
00:52:50,399 --> 00:52:52,498
and there'll be less of you.

514
00:52:52,533 --> 00:52:54,665
You live your life for them

515
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,865
and they don't even see you.

516
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,571
You don't even see yourself.

517
00:53:03,544 --> 00:53:06,446
We don't get a lot of things
to really care about.

518
00:53:41,879 --> 00:53:45,815
Derek, who has my pig?

519
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:59,268
He's not somebody
you wanna make angry.

520
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:05,439
He will be angry.

521
00:54:09,973 --> 00:54:12,611
Rob.

522
00:54:12,646 --> 00:54:15,416
Rob, it wasn't me, okay?

523
00:54:15,451 --> 00:54:17,550
I don't even talk to him.

524
00:54:17,585 --> 00:54:19,486
Open it.

525
00:54:19,521 --> 00:54:21,719
Rob, I didn't say shit, okay?

526
00:54:21,754 --> 00:54:25,492
Please,
I... I didn't even know about it.

527
00:54:25,527 --> 00:54:27,263
Take me to him.

528
00:54:28,728 --> 00:54:31,333
It's my dad, okay?

529
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:32,763
It's my dad.
You don't understand.

530
00:54:32,798 --> 00:54:34,468
No.

531
00:54:34,503 --> 00:54:36,305
Fuck. Stop.

532
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,801
Stop.
What the fuck?

533
00:54:37,836 --> 00:54:39,572
The Camaro.
What the fuck?

534
00:54:39,607 --> 00:54:41,035
The Camaro. Stop.

535
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:43,444
- You psycho.
- What's his address?

536
00:54:43,479 --> 00:54:45,314
Listen, man,
I will get you a new one.

537
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:46,744
I will get you a new one.
I swear.

538
00:54:46,779 --> 00:54:47,811
I'll take a hit for the season.

539
00:54:47,846 --> 00:54:49,648
What is it?

540
00:54:51,817 --> 00:54:53,553
380 Northwest Willow.

541
00:54:55,557 --> 00:54:57,920
We're done.

542
00:54:57,955 --> 00:54:59,856
I don't wanna see you again.

543
00:55:01,794 --> 00:55:03,926
So that's it?

544
00:55:03,961 --> 00:55:05,433
Really?

545
00:55:06,865 --> 00:55:07,963
I'm right here.

546
00:55:07,998 --> 00:55:09,437
Man, I am right here.

547
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:10,933
We can work this out.

548
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:14,871
Okay. You know what? Fuck.

549
00:55:27,787 --> 00:55:30,821
<i>All great men
are ahead of their time</i>

550
00:55:30,856 --> 00:55:32,526
<i>and then all great music,</i>

551
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:34,495
<i>no matter when written,
you shall find</i>

552
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:35,661
<i>the instances of...</i>

553
00:56:11,193 --> 00:56:12,797
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

554
00:56:18,607 --> 00:56:21,938
Um, I met the guy

555
00:56:21,973 --> 00:56:23,577
who, um...

556
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:27,416
who made you that dinner.

557
00:56:29,948 --> 00:56:31,882
Do you remember that dinner?

558
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:42,530
I actually think
you'd really like him.

559
00:56:45,997 --> 00:56:47,931
Maybe not.

560
00:56:49,165 --> 00:56:51,033
I don't know.

561
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:05,520
Would you wish
Dad would just let you die?

562
00:57:08,624 --> 00:57:11,185
So do you just wish
that he'd let you die?

563
00:57:15,928 --> 00:57:18,500
Excuse me.

564
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:21,063
Um, I was gonna clean
her trach but...

565
00:57:21,098 --> 00:57:23,934
- Uh-hmm.
- ...did you wanna see her?

566
00:57:23,969 --> 00:57:25,199
No.

567
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,950
Can I say...

568
00:57:39,985 --> 00:57:42,953
it's an honor meeting you?

569
00:57:42,988 --> 00:57:45,923
Half the restaurants in Portland
owe you a debt.

570
00:57:48,257 --> 00:57:50,532
I'd like my pig back.

571
00:57:55,264 --> 00:57:58,969
My son means well, but, uh,

572
00:57:59,004 --> 00:58:00,938
he's not cut out
for this business.

573
00:58:00,973 --> 00:58:02,808
It'll eat him alive.

574
00:58:04,009 --> 00:58:05,140
I mean, he'll be okay.

575
00:58:05,175 --> 00:58:07,142
I'll find him a nice desk job,

576
00:58:07,177 --> 00:58:10,519
something out of the way.
That's really where he belongs.

577
00:58:11,819 --> 00:58:12,950
I don't care.

578
00:58:15,823 --> 00:58:17,790
You know, he, uh,

579
00:58:17,825 --> 00:58:22,190
he told me the first day
that he met you

580
00:58:22,225 --> 00:58:24,995
was actually sweet.

581
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:28,504
And I didn't think the business
would take off, but...

582
00:58:29,705 --> 00:58:32,640
here I am with egg on my face.

583
00:58:35,942 --> 00:58:37,843
But I think now it's time
for somebody who knows

584
00:58:37,878 --> 00:58:39,141
what they're doing to take over.

585
00:58:39,176 --> 00:58:42,144
I want my pig back.

586
00:58:42,179 --> 00:58:45,752
Yeah. I'll give you $15,000
to walk away.

587
00:58:45,787 --> 00:58:47,281
- No.
- Twenty thousand.

588
00:58:47,316 --> 00:58:49,657
- No.
- Twenty million?

589
00:58:55,291 --> 00:58:57,698
I control myself very well,

590
00:58:57,733 --> 00:59:00,096
but I don't think
you understand what I am.

591
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:05,068
From the very first moment
my son started selling for you,

592
00:59:05,103 --> 00:59:07,037
you've been in my world.

593
00:59:07,072 --> 00:59:10,304
This whole time,
all these years,

594
00:59:10,339 --> 00:59:13,208
Edgar, Finway,

595
00:59:13,243 --> 00:59:15,848
those tweaked out fucks,

596
00:59:15,883 --> 00:59:18,279
they're mine.

597
00:59:18,314 --> 00:59:21,282
That's just how it is.

598
00:59:21,317 --> 00:59:24,120
You have nothing
to bargain with.

599
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:29,631
Now I will have
$25,000 delivered

600
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:32,601
to that little campground
of yours tomorrow.

601
00:59:34,198 --> 00:59:36,330
If I see you again,

602
00:59:36,365 --> 00:59:38,904
you do anything to fuck with me,

603
00:59:38,939 --> 00:59:41,874
I will chop that pig up
into bacon.

604
00:59:43,306 --> 00:59:45,240
I can buy another one.

605
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,914
Now get out of my house.

606
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,347
Were you always like this...

607
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:56,317
or was it just after she died?

608
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:01,795
Were you?

609
01:00:06,098 --> 01:00:09,297
You made the right choice

610
01:00:09,332 --> 01:00:11,398
being out there in the woods.

611
01:00:11,433 --> 01:00:13,268
You had your moment,

612
01:00:13,303 --> 01:00:16,040
but there's nothing here
for you anymore.

613
01:00:16,075 --> 01:00:18,680
There's really nothing here
for most of us.

614
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:21,111
You don't keep a grip on it,

615
01:00:21,146 --> 01:00:23,817
that's pretty much it.

616
01:00:25,348 --> 01:00:27,117
Buy yourself a new pig.

617
01:01:16,498 --> 01:01:18,806
I thought
you might need your ride.

618
01:01:21,239 --> 01:01:22,810
I have a bike.

619
01:01:24,979 --> 01:01:26,913
I'm sorry I told him about you.

620
01:01:30,248 --> 01:01:32,182
I really didn't know
he'd take her.

621
01:02:04,282 --> 01:02:07,217
I don't need my pig
to find truffles.

622
01:02:09,287 --> 01:02:11,518
What?

623
01:02:11,553 --> 01:02:12,992
The trees.

624
01:02:15,161 --> 01:02:17,095
The trees tell you
where to look.

625
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,396
Then why the fuck
did we do all this?

626
01:02:28,306 --> 01:02:30,075
I love her.

627
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,295
Do you have a pen?

628
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:54,297
What?

629
01:02:54,332 --> 01:02:56,266
I have to write something.

630
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:02,041
Um...

631
01:03:08,115 --> 01:03:10,478
well, if the city floods,
we can always go up

632
01:03:10,513 --> 01:03:12,546
to Mount Hood.

633
01:03:12,581 --> 01:03:14,350
Hood's an active volcano.

634
01:03:18,521 --> 01:03:21,093
Well, I'm not fucking
moving to Seattle.

635
01:03:21,128 --> 01:03:22,292
Fuck Seattle.

636
01:03:24,296 --> 01:03:25,933
I'm gonna need you
to drop me off

637
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,067
and go and get everything
on that list.

638
01:03:29,532 --> 01:03:31,037
I can't get all these stuff.

639
01:03:31,072 --> 01:03:32,500
Check in with the names.

640
01:03:32,535 --> 01:03:33,435
Tell them you're with me.

641
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:39,243
You want me to use your name?

642
01:03:48,518 --> 01:03:50,287
Should I even ask
what we're doing?

643
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:54,456
We're getting my pig back.

644
01:04:29,526 --> 01:04:31,031
<i>Can I help you?</i>

645
01:04:31,066 --> 01:04:34,067
Hi. Um, I'm looking for Jezebel.

646
01:04:35,631 --> 01:04:37,873
<i>You'll have to schedule
an appointment.</i>

647
01:04:40,944 --> 01:04:42,372
Robin Feld sent me.

648
01:05:13,603 --> 01:05:15,108
Are these all yours?

649
01:05:15,143 --> 01:05:19,112
Well, now, yes.

650
01:05:19,147 --> 01:05:22,577
They used to belong
to Robin and Laurie.

651
01:05:26,154 --> 01:05:27,582
Who's Laurie?

652
01:05:39,464 --> 01:05:41,695
He didn't ask me to

653
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:44,665
but I'm saving
the one next to it for him.

654
01:05:46,735 --> 01:05:48,944
You tell him that, okay?

655
01:06:01,189 --> 01:06:03,057
You made it a bakery?

656
01:06:06,194 --> 01:06:07,589
I'm a baker.

657
01:06:10,528 --> 01:06:13,364
I kept it the same
for a couple years.

658
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:17,566
I thought maybe you'd come
take it back...

659
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:22,010
but you didn't.

660
01:06:23,211 --> 01:06:26,982
And, um, it wasn't me,

661
01:06:30,548 --> 01:06:32,086
you're a chef,

662
01:06:33,419 --> 01:06:34,990
I'm a baker.

663
01:06:42,428 --> 01:06:47,002
Do you still make
your salted baguette?

664
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,305
Robin...

665
01:06:59,379 --> 01:07:01,115
I do still make it.

666
01:07:04,483 --> 01:07:05,779
The same recipe?

667
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:08,452
Same recipe.

668
01:07:13,756 --> 01:07:15,294
Do you have a loaf?

669
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:02,704
Can I have another?

670
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:32,668
Bye, chef.

671
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:46,715
You got rid of the curtains?

672
01:08:48,653 --> 01:08:50,521
Laurie always wanted to.

673
01:08:52,756 --> 01:08:54,228
This is better.

674
01:11:34,687 --> 01:11:35,785
Dad?

675
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:39,921
Dad, can you come out here?

676
01:11:41,859 --> 01:11:43,397
We made you dinner.

677
01:11:45,929 --> 01:11:47,665
You can leave.

678
01:12:00,878 --> 01:12:02,416
We made you dinner.

679
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:31,742
Thank you.

680
01:12:55,438 --> 01:12:56,965
Your son found this.

681
01:14:50,982 --> 01:14:52,113
Hmm.

682
01:15:39,162 --> 01:15:40,634
Get out.

683
01:15:45,168 --> 01:15:46,739
Please get out.

684
01:15:50,008 --> 01:15:51,073
Get out!

685
01:15:51,108 --> 01:15:52,778
Get out of my house!

686
01:15:52,813 --> 01:15:54,175
Get out!

687
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:03,558
I remember every meal
I ever cooked.

688
01:16:05,958 --> 01:16:09,025
I remember every person

689
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:10,697
I ever served.

690
01:16:15,363 --> 01:16:17,671
Why are you doing this?

691
01:16:38,386 --> 01:16:40,628
I'm sorry.
But, um...

692
01:16:44,931 --> 01:16:46,898
by the time I got it,

693
01:16:48,264 --> 01:16:51,397
these waste of space junkies,

694
01:16:51,432 --> 01:16:52,805
they...

695
01:16:55,172 --> 01:16:56,941
They were too rough,

696
01:17:00,045 --> 01:17:03,343
we couldn't...

697
01:17:06,315 --> 01:17:07,886
she died.

698
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:53,057
What can I get you two?

699
01:18:55,523 --> 01:18:57,325
What pie do you have today?

700
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,997
We don't do pie.

701
01:19:00,231 --> 01:19:01,296
You don't do pie?

702
01:19:02,365 --> 01:19:04,200
We have chocolate chip cookies,

703
01:19:04,235 --> 01:19:06,169
cheesecake, and brownies.

704
01:19:06,204 --> 01:19:07,104
All right.

705
01:19:07,139 --> 01:19:08,941
We'll get two brownies.

706
01:19:08,976 --> 01:19:10,338
We'll have some coffee too.

707
01:19:10,373 --> 01:19:11,779
Cream and sugar?

708
01:19:11,814 --> 01:19:12,846
Sure.

709
01:19:25,828 --> 01:19:27,058
What are you thinking?

710
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:33,427
I was thinking

711
01:19:39,237 --> 01:19:41,941
if I never came looking for her,

712
01:19:44,011 --> 01:19:45,274
in my head,

713
01:19:47,311 --> 01:19:49,080
she'd still be alive.

714
01:19:55,253 --> 01:19:56,824
But she wouldn't be.

715
01:20:25,151 --> 01:20:26,414
No, she wouldn't.

716
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,043
You okay?

717
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:58,578
I think I'm gonna walk.

718
01:21:04,289 --> 01:21:05,585
You okay?

719
01:21:13,562 --> 01:21:14,627
Yeah.

720
01:21:44,593 --> 01:21:46,263
I'll see you Thursday?

721
01:21:46,298 --> 01:21:47,528
Yeah.

722
01:22:09,717 --> 01:22:12,124
<i>...shall not be
difficult for him to recognize</i>

723
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:15,523
<i>the three elements
on which music rests,</i>

724
01:22:15,558 --> 01:22:19,065

725
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:22,233

726
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,765

727
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,438

728

729
01:25:53,347 --> 01:25:54,808
<i>to a really fancy restaurant
tonight</i>

730
01:25:54,843 --> 01:25:57,514
<i>and you're gonna complain
about the food,</i>

731
01:25:57,549 --> 01:26:00,352
<i>and I'm gonna have
to get really drunk</i>

732
01:26:00,387 --> 01:26:01,815
<i>to deal with it.</i>

733
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:04,554

734
01:26:04,589 --> 01:26:06,292
