00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,160
- Hey, folks.
- It's that time again, right?

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,280
Yeah.

4
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,440
Good size?

5
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,240
Come on, guys. Hurry up.

6
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,600
You good?

7
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,440
- What's going on?
- We're all set.

8
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,640
- You guys ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready. You ready?

9
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,080
- Let's do this.
- All right. Let's do it. Fuck this.

10
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,160
Get down! Get down!

11
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,760
- Get down! Don't make me fucking do it.
- Oh, my God!

12
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,080
- Get down! Get down! Don't move.
- Get your hands up.

13
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,560
There you go.

14
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,720
Nice and easy.
Nobody gets hurt.

15
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,720
We don't need any heroes.

16
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,560
Ready?

17
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,400
- Police! Freeze!
- Let's go!

18
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,720
Freeze!

19
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,640
Drop your weapon!
Now! I said now!

20
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,960
Let's go! Get in the car!

21
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,560
What are you doing?

22
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,680
- Oh, my God!
- Get in the car!

23
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,000
<i>One thing that always stuck
with me on the streets,</i>

24
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,400
<i>never do armored trucks.</i>

25
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,880
- Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

26
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,320
Over there.

27
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,640
Hey! Son of a bitch!

28
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,360
Hey! You little
bastards, get back here!

29
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,400
No menthols.

30
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,680
Why don't you guys have a couple
of Cokes? Go sit over there.

31
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,920
I got some stuff to do.
I'll be with you in a minute.

32
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,240
Where'd you get
the cigarettes?

33
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,120
Fell off a truck.

34
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,800
Twice in one week?

35
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,320
How'd you like to
do an errand for me?

36
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,840
- Sure.
- Depends.

37
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,880
- Did you go down to Williams yet?
- Not yet.

38
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,120
I want you to go down to Williams
Tavern and pick up an envelope.

39
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,560
- Can you handle that?
- Sure.

40
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,960
How much?

41
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,320
How much. Listen to
this kid. "How much?"

42
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,200
Fifty bucks. Is that enough?

43
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,840
- Sure.
- Sure.

44
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,080
Brian.

45
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,840
Brian. Brian.

46
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,160
We have to be quiet.

47
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,280
This is nice,
Stacy. Come here.

48
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,400
We can't do nothing 'cause
my mother's upstairs.

49
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,400
Hey, hey. No hanging
around. Call it a night.

50
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,560
What do you think of this
coat, Jackie? A little too big?

51
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,040
- No, it looks good.
- It looks good.

52
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,200
- How'd you make out? Did you find him?
- We got him.

53
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
It's cold out.

54
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,280
Oh, yeah. It's
colder where he is.

55
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,360
Get him out. Get him
out. Come on. Come on.

56
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,880
- Come on. Get out. Get out.
- Come on, out! Out!

57
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,000
Get him in the back. Hurry up.

58
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,200
Get in. Get in there.

59
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,120
- So fuck me, huh?
- What?

60
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,440
Fuck me?

61
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,640
- No, no, it's okay. Say it. Fuck me.
- Listen, I never said...

62
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,880
Didn't I tell you any money made
around here, I see a piece of it?

63
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,000
You did.

64
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,920
And what have you given
me? What have you given me?

65
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,280
I haven't...

66
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,200
Don't you scream! Don't
you fucking scream!

67
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,800
I'll put a fucking
hole right in you again.

68
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,080
I always wonder why people scream
when they're in pain, Jackie.

69
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,720
It's like when they slurp coffee thinking
it's gonna change the temperature,

70
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,200
- but it doesn't.
- You're right. It doesn't change a thing.

71
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,240
I get a kick out of guys like you.
I see you around the neighborhood,

72
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,480
playing your gangster roles,
tough guys, arms folded,

73
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,440
talking out of the side of
your mouth. Now look at him.

74
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
I can't believe it.

75
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,120
Didn't you put that Sweeney kid in
the hospital for money he owed you?

76
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,520
So you're a fucking bully,
too, right? Oh, yeah, you are.

77
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,800
- What's that kid, 150 pounds, Jackie?
- Tops.

78
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,560
- You got my money on you?
- No.

79
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,440
Do you got the money
you owe me on you?

80
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,960
No.

81
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,520
Here, cut this up.

82
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,680
That prick down at Williams
Tavern is ducking me again.

83
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,800
Go down and get some
money off him, will you?

84
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,440
Another slow week.

85
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,920
I'm sick and tired of all
this nickel-and-dime bullshit.

86
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,280
I'm not gonna wait all
day for this cocksucker.

87
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,680
Hey, guys, what's up?

88
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Fuck!

89
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,080
Do you wanna get involved?

90
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,880
- Are you gonna be warm enough?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

91
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,360
- You don't need a sweater?
- No.

92
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,520
- You sure?
- Yeah.

93
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,800
All right.

94
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,320
- Oh, good. You're just in time.
- For what?

95
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,520
Sean's game.

96
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,040
I can't. I'm running
right back out. I gotta go.

97
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,680
- Where are the...
- It's the playoffs.

98
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,080
I can't. I'm busy. I'll catch
your next game. I promise.

99
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,800
What's to eat?

100
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,000
...from behind,
duct-taped me...

101
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,800
- Does it sound like that?
- Yeah.

102
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,960
- Hey! That's them right there.
- Look who it is.

103
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,240
Yeah. With a scar over there.

104
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,240
- A thing of beauty.
- How'd that tape treat you?

105
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,040
It's all right. It's all right.
Almost took my mustache off.

106
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,600
- What'd you tell them?
- I didn't tell them nothing.

107
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,040
I told them they better
find the guys who did it

108
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,040
'cause I'm not
paying for that shit

109
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,080
- out of my own pocket.
- That's right.

110
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,840
- What are you having?
- I'll take a cold beer.

111
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,760
- Give him a cold beer.
- Thank you.

112
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,920
Yeah.

113
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,320
- Good job, good job. - Wrists almost
ripped off, mustache is gone.

114
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,840
I gotta hit the head.
I'll talk to you later.

115
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,800
Hey, come here, boys. Hey,
boys, I got you something.

116
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,480
Come here, shorty.

117
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,320
What are you doing
out in the rain?

118
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,720
- Come over here.
- Something for everybody.

119
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,320
Hey, there's your ma.

120
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,240
Hey, Stacy. Hey, Katie.

121
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,200
- Call me later. - I'll give you a call
around 8:00, all right?

122
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,800
- Hey, Katie.
- Hi, Brian.

123
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,280
- Yo, Katie, you want a ride home?
- Yeah.

124
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,960
- Say goodbye to your Uncle Paulie.
- Bye.

125
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,360
Pay some bills. Get
yourself a little something.

126
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,400
Thanks. Are you staying for
supper or are you running out?

127
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,440
Yeah, yeah. Do you mind?

128
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,200
- The good old days.
- Yeah.

129
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,040
He's upstairs.

130
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,680
- What's his name?
- Marius.

131
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,200
Marius. Yeah, Marius.

132
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,240
Might as well go talk to
him. See what he has to say.

133
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,720
$5,000 is $5,000, right?

134
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,640
- Yeah.
- All right.

135
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,200
- Jackie, again the soup is freezing.
- Again, cold?

136
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,800
- Tell Hogie, "Hogie, the soup's freezing!"
- You gotta be kidding me.

137
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,320
- Marius, how you doing?
- I'm not too good.

138
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,320
Here's what happened.

139
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,400
I'm 60 years old, so
I had this indiscretion

140
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,160
with this young manicurist
on Newbury Street,

141
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,800
and then this cunt and her
boyfriend called my wife!

142
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,920
Hold it. Indiscretion?
You're losing us.

143
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,480
- I was fucking her. I was fucking her.
- What?

144
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,560
- He was cheating on his wife.
- I want them to pay, especially her.

145
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,640
Wait a minute. You want
us to slap a girl around?

146
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,240
No, no, no. You see,

147
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,400
this bitch has these two poodles
that she loves like her own children.

148
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,680
I want you to
kidnap the female.

149
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,400
Now, it has to be the female. I
don't care what you do to the guy.

150
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,480
I'll pay you five grand.

151
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,160
Let me get this straight. You
want us to kidnap a poodle?

152
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,360
Yeah.

153
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,480
Do you think we're a couple of
jerk-offs? No, you're making fun of us.

154
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,160
- No, no, no! No, but you see...
- No, hey, hey!

155
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,400
Giving a guy a beating is one thing, all
right? But kidnapping a fucking dog...

156
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,120
No, no, but you
don't understand.

157
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,800
She's the one that has to
pay. She called my wife.

158
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,600
- The guy's a fucking nut.
- Five grand is five grand, Paulie.

159
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,720
I'm not doing it.

160
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,320
- Come on, we'll get some kid for
a C-note. - Hey, I'm not doing it.

161
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,400
Kidnap a fucking poodle. What
are you, out of your mind?

162
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,920
I know you don't like this,

163
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,200
but I think we should seriously
consider doing an armored car.

164
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,480
Don't start with that again.
Don't start with that again.

165
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,560
Everybody gets caught.

166
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,400
You gotta do it in broad daylight.
Everybody sees you. It's impossible.

167
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,120
All right? Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

168
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,880
Brian! Brian! I got him.

169
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,200
- I got the motherfucker.
- Spread his legs. Let me see.

170
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,880
It's got balls. Go in
there and get the other one.

171
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,920
- They're vicious maniacs!
- Get the fuck back in there.

172
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,600
It's not funny. It's a
fucking poodle. It's not funny.

173
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,840
- It's kind of funny.
- Brian, it's not funny.

174
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,680
- It's not funny. It's embarrassing.
- A little funny.

175
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,680
- What are we gonna do?
- I got this kid, Anthony, all right?

176
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,720
He's making a lot of money,
and he don't answer to anybody.

177
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,280
What about Pat?

178
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,800
We gotta start
making our own money.

179
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,200
That rat McGill is
giving up everyone.

180
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,640
No wonder, with the deals
they're giving today.

181
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,520
I should've killed that
prick when I had the chance.

182
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,040
- Yeah. Definitely.
- We took care of that.

183
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,600
Yeah, he called.

184
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,840
- Hey, Jackie.
- Hey, Jackie.

185
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,320
Here you go.

186
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,920
He said $5,000.

187
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,120
Yeah, that's your cut. You got
a problem with that, Paulie?

188
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,120
- Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do.
- You do?

189
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,520
Yeah, yeah. You know
what, Pat? Keep it.

190
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,920
Hey, come here.
Come here. Come here!

191
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,240
Who the fuck you think you're
talking to, some fucking punk?

192
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,720
I've been lining your
pockets since you were a kid!

193
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,840
If it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't have shit!

194
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,120
That's not the point, Pat.

195
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,560
The point is it's supposed
to be getting easier.

196
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,760
You think you're the only one with
problems? I got heat up my ass,

197
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,280
and you've been moping around here
for months with this fucking attitude,

198
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,120
and I'm tired of it.
You better work on that

199
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,960
because I'm telling you, we're gonna
have a fucking problem! You got that?

200
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,440
You got that?

201
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,400
You better talk to him, Brian.

202
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,800
You see what I'm talking about? You
see what I'm fucking talking about?

203
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,440
He treats us like we're a
couple of fucking assholes!

204
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,120
Okay, relax, Paul.

205
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,120
Come on. Let me in. Let me in!

206
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,320
What'd he say to you, huh?

207
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,480
Then we drive off with the truck.
That's it. It's that simple.

208
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,720
- Who is this guy?
- George Shea. I've known him for years.

209
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,440
He's solid.

210
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,560
He's not gonna try to
fuck us on the price?

211
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,640
- No?
- No.

212
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,080
We get paid that night,
and then we're on our way.

213
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,440
Does he have to
know who we are?

214
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,680
He doesn't care how the TVs get
there, as long as they get there.

215
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,040
All right, Anthony,
we'll see you tonight.

216
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,400
All right, cool. Call me.

217
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,480
Hey, Brian, why
don't you go home?

218
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,280
- Why don't you mind your business, Katie?
- You know, he's got a girl.

219
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,480
Hey, do me a favor, tell Paulie
to come over here, will you?

220
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,240
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, and then go home.

221
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,800
Why don't you buy
me a fucking drink?

222
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,960
- Hey, Paulie.
- Yeah, what?

223
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,000
Brian wants to talk to you.

224
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,920
Okay. All right. Two seconds.
So you got a place to...

225
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,560
- I gotta pay the bills.
- You gotta pay the bills?

226
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,880
I'll pay your bills.
You got a place to stay?

227
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,680
- You'll pay my bills?
- That's right, I'll pay your bills.

228
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,400
- All right, well, I'm on a couch right now.
- You're on a...

229
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,600
I'll go on the
couch, you go...

230
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,120
Why don't you stay at my
house? What's your name?

231
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,560
- How big is your couch?
- How big is my couch?

232
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,960
- My name is Lisa.
- My couch is big enough.

233
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,120
All right, Lisa, I'm
gonna go talk to my friend.

234
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,560
I'm gonna come back, and
I'm gonna talk to you.

235
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,080
We're gonna talk some more about my
couch, all right? Holy fucking shit.

236
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,400
Deal me out.

237
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,000
Yeah, no problem.

238
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,960
- You know that kid Jay?
- What, the kid behind me?

239
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,840
Yeah. He's making a lot
of money with that coke.

240
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,640
- Yeah? How do you know?
- I just do.

241
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,040
- We should get some from him.
- Who's he with?

242
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,480
- Nobody, that's my point.
- Let's go.

243
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,920
- Hey, Jay, can we talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah, yeah.

244
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,200
- Hey, cute girl.
- Yeah, I know her.

245
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,680
- Hey, kid. Did you see Charlie?
- How you been?

246
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,400
- You know Paulie, right?
- Yeah.

247
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,520
- How's it going?
- Good.

248
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,440
Hey, Jay, we want to talk to
you tomorrow. Is that all right?

249
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,840
- What about? Everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

250
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,760
You want to meet us at the
Heights at 2:00 tomorrow?

251
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,960
- All right.
- Don't worry. Have a good time tonight.

252
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,080
Hey, Pat.

253
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,720
- How you doing?
- All right.

254
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,960
- Busy, huh?
- Yeah.

255
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,800
Hey, you two haven't heard of a truck
full of TVs disappearing, did you?

256
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,760
- No.
- Nothing?

257
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,040
- You sure?
- Yeah, we're sure.

258
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,400
It's funny, I
got a call from...

259
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,480
Well, anyway, you keep your ears open.
Let me know if you hear anything, will you?

260
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,160
Yeah. No problem.

261
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,080
All right.

262
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,840
Greedy prick.

263
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,360
Hey. Hey, guys.

264
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,440
- Shit.
- All right, let's go.

265
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,280
Sean, help your
brother. Here's your bag.

266
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,000
- Why don't you go wait in the kitchen?
- All right, be good. Learn a lot.

267
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,280
That's great. Here, Sean,
help him put on his jacket.

268
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,120
I can't get the zipper.

269
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,520
It's 8:00 in the morning.
Where the hell have you been?

270
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,280
- Out. Out.
- Where?

271
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,800
- Where?
- I don't want to hear it. Here.

272
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,960
Like this solves everything.

273
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,400
Come on.

274
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,120
Come on.

275
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,720
- Brian, this has gotta stop.
- Yeah, okay.

276
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,000
All right, yeah, whatever
you say. I won't do it again.

277
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,320
For the last time, just
let me get some sleep.

278
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,600
- Yeah?
- Hey, it's me.

279
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,840
<i>- Jackie wants to see us.
- For what?</i>

280
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,440
I don't know. He
didn't say anything.

281
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,560
All right. I'll be there.

282
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,320
Feds got Pat.

283
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,080
For what?

284
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,480
They're trying to pin some
old bullshit murder rap on him.

285
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
For when? Who?

286
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,440
- You know that prick, Mickey Gills?
- Yeah.

287
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,200
He's been flipping on
everybody from years ago,

288
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,520
trying to get his
sentence cut in half.

289
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,760
What's he looking at?

290
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,880
If he pleads out to
manslaughter, eight.

291
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,440
Hey, don't worry about it,
though. It'll be all right.

292
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,320
- Nothing changes.
- Yeah, sure.

293
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,400
- Of course.
- Nothing.

294
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,600
- I can't fucking believe it.
- What do you think?

295
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,080
I think it's time
to go see that kid.

296
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,400
She's not going to mind doing
it, you know, coming to tell me...

297
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,680
Hey, Jay.

298
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,440
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

299
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,960
No problem. Nice car.

300
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,320
Thanks.

301
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,120
You're making good money
with that coke, huh?

302
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,600
I'm doing all right.

303
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,080
Personally, I don't care
how you make your money.

304
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,640
You don't sell it
to the kids, right?

305
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,360
- No.
- Let's cut to the chase, all right?

306
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,360
You're making a lot of money
with that, and we want some.

307
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,760
All right. So you
got two choices.

308
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,960
You can either come up with
a little something each week,

309
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,480
or, better yet, you can set up some
dealers, we'll rob them and cut you in.

310
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,320
- You want me to set up my connections?
- Yeah.

311
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,600
I can't do that. They know me.

312
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,000
- They know where the fuck I live.
- Yeah, but so do we.

313
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
Brian, are you gonna
put me on the spot?

314
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,720
I known you how long? We're
from the same neighborhood.

315
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,280
- What am I supposed to do?
- Jay, fuck them.

316
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,760
So if this goes good, they say they
might need 50 pounds every 10 days.

317
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,320
- I got all you need, man.
- Yeah, I bet.

318
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,600
- I'll go get them.
- All right, I'll be here.

319
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,400
Hey, what's going on?

320
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,280
- Oh, God.
- Relax, Tommy, you're gonna be okay.

321
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,480
- Jay, what's going on?
- Bad day for you, Tommy.

322
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,360
Just chalk it up as a loss, Tommy.
You'll make it back in a couple of weeks.

323
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,480
I'll take this. Thank you.

324
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,640
Okay. In case you get
stupid, that look familiar?

325
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,560
Jay, stuff in the back?

326
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,160
- Trunk open, Tommy?
- Yeah.

327
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,280
Tommy, I'm gonna
take the keys.

328
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,400
I'm gonna throw them in
the alley around the corner.

329
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,960
Give yourself a few minutes
to pull yourself together.

330
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,600
When you go back to Braintree, you
don't mention any of this to anybody.

331
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,480
- Got it?
- Yeah.

332
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,360
- Try these out.
- They're too big. I'm a seven.

333
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,600
- What?
- These are big.

334
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,640
All right, just put another pair
of socks on. They'll be fine.

335
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,520
- Don't worry, I'll get you another pair.
- That won't work.

336
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,040
Hey, you got it on
the wrong foot, boss.

337
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,240
Hey, you want to help your brother
when you're done? You guys hungry?

338
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
- Yeah, I guess.
- All right.

339
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,760
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

340
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,320
You look good.

341
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,200
Hey, Brian. How are you doing?

342
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,160
- I'm okay.
- Yeah? Can I get you something to drink?

343
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,000
Yeah. Stacy?

344
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,920
- I'm all set.
- Okay. The usual?

345
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,720
No. Yeah, give me...

346
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,280
No, I'm gonna have... Give me just
whatever you got on tap. Thanks.

347
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,440
Okay.

348
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,800
Friend of yours?

349
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,040
What do you mean
"friend"? She works here.

350
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,000
What?

351
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,600
Are you mad now because
the waitress knows my name?

352
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,360
Then why are you getting
all quiet all of a sudden?

353
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,440
How come you
didn't introduce me?

354
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,840
What are you talking
about? She's the waitress.

355
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,960
I thought she just might be more
than that, the way you eyed her.

356
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,680
See? That's why
we never go out.

357
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,280
We never go out because you're
always too busy running around.

358
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,200
You want to start
this all over again?

359
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,640
Let's not ruin a
nice night, okay?

360
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,520
I would've introduced you,
but I don't even know her name.

361
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,600
Here you go, honey.

362
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,720
- I'm sorry, what's your name?
- Kim.

363
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
- Kim.
- Yeah.

364
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,760
- Kim, this is my wife Stacy.
- Hi.

365
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,920
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

366
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,280
- You need a few minutes?
- Just one.

367
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,480
Okay, I'll be back. Thanks.

368
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,040
- We okay now?
- Yeah.

369
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,000
Excuse me, can I get a
couple of menus, please?

370
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,200
Sorry.

371
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,480
Take your time.

372
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,160
Here.

373
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,480
- No, no, she meant it for you, I think.
- Take it, please.

374
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,760
Charlie, can we have
a couple of minutes?

375
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,360
- Sure.
- Thanks, man.

376
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,440
Hey, Brian.

377
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,640
- Hey, Jay. How'd you make out?
- Paulie.

378
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,560
- Not bad. $900 a pound.
- $900 a pound.

379
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,640
That's 45 grand.

380
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,560
So, what, 12.5 for you?

381
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,560
- That sound good to you?
- Yeah, that sounds good.

382
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,600
- That's good, yeah.
- All right, let's do it.

383
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,280
Listen, I gotta get going, but
I'm gonna see that guy Friday.

384
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,680
- All right. Okay.
- Okay?

385
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,720
I gotta run, too.

386
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,040
Well, don't forget we got
that guy at 1:00, 1:30.

387
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,640
- Forty-five grand, that's not
bad. - That's good. Good job.

388
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,960
Hey, Jay.

389
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,640
You got a little bit of that
shit on you until Friday?

390
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,000
Yeah, yeah.

391
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
- Thanks.
- See you Friday.

392
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,800
It's a good business, Paulie.
Jewelry is always in demand.

393
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,960
Yeah, yeah, all right, but
just so we're on the same page,

394
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,440
I give you 10 grand now,

395
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,920
then you give me 200 a week for
a year, plus my 10 grand back.

396
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
- Yeah, definitely.
- Okay, that'll work.

397
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,760
I'll be back in a minute.

398
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,800
All right.

399
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,960
- Who is it?
- Brian.

400
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,880
- Hey, Jay.
- What's up, Brian?

401
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,920
I was wondering if you
have any of that money yet.

402
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,760
I told you I wasn't gonna have it
till Friday. Hey, come in, come in.

403
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,200
Thanks. You having a party?

404
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,400
- Yeah, you want a drink?
- Sure.

405
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,480
Hey, Brian, what's
up? I'm Matt.

406
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,280
Hey. How you doing? Yeah,
I've seen you around.

407
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,600
- Here.
- Yeah, I'll take that.

408
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,480
What do you got?

409
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,360
- How much, Brian?
- A "G."

410
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,360
I don't have a
"G." I don't have...

411
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,160
Jay, come on. What do you got?

412
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,880
I don't... I could
give you like 500.

413
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,600
I'll take that. You
got some coke, too?

414
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,000
Yeah, give me a second.

415
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,440
Fuck them, Jay. Fuck them!

416
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,520
- These your girlfriends?
- No, they're strippers.

417
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,760
- Oh, yeah? You're a dancer?
- Yeah.

418
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,840
Show me some of your moves.

419
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,880
Nice. Let's see the backside.

420
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,160
Nice.

421
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,360
Tim, how you doing?

422
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,400
Yeah, set me up.

423
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,400
I'll set you up.

424
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,160
- What's that you're smoking? Crack?
- Yeah.

425
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,120
You guys are freebasers, huh?
It's like a morgue in here.

426
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,160
I want to be dead like you.

427
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,000
Here's the five, Brian.
Plenty of coke, all right?

428
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,880
Come on, no more coke for you.

429
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,920
That's not bad.

430
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,240
- You gotta suck it in real hard.
- Okay.

431
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,000
When it fills up with
smoke, take your finger off.

432
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,280
All right, I
think I got it now.

433
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,800
Where is he?
Everything all right?

434
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,440
- What do you mean? He's not here?
- No, he never came home.

435
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,960
- Weren't you with him last night?
- Yeah, yeah, I was with him earlier.

436
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,000
- This is it. I've had it.
- What?

437
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,720
Every night he's out until
3:00, 4:00 in the morning.

438
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,520
- Take it easy.
- You take it easy!

439
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,080
- Stace. Stace.
- 15 years of this shit.

440
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,240
I know.

441
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,200
12:00 in the afternoon?
You're the biggest asshole...

442
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,760
I just spent the night locked
up! Leave me the fuck alone!

443
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,360
Hello?

444
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,560
He just got in.

445
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,840
It's Paul.

446
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,600
- Yeah, tell him I'll call him back.
- He's gonna call you back.

447
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,320
I don't know, some bullshit
about being arrested. I gotta go.

448
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,840
So what happened?

449
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,400
Nothing. I was just
with some broad.

450
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,320
- You okay?
- Yeah.

451
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,040
Jay! Jay! Jay!

452
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,400
Almost had a touchdown there.

453
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,120
I got your message. What's up?

454
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,200
Yeah. Remember that kid Matt you
met at my house the other night?

455
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,320
- Yeah, yeah. What about him?
- When was this?

456
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,480
What?

457
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,200
Last week sometime.
What about him?

458
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,640
Well, he sells steroids to these
muscle-heads out in Stoneham.

459
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,680
Yeah? There's money in that?

460
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,240
- I guess. He says 20 to 30 grand.
- 20 to 30 grand?

461
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,520
Yeah! Yeah.

462
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,520
Well, anyways, he's
been dealing a few years.

463
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
His connection
just got busted.

464
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,760
These fucking clowns keep paging him
every day for more. They don't know.

465
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,680
- Is he for real? - I figured you guys
might want to take them.

466
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,400
- No bullshit.
- Yeah.

467
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,840
You know, it sounds good.

468
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,280
Sounds real good. All right, we'll
give you a call tomorrow. Thanks.

469
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,800
- Thanks, Jay.
- Paulie.

470
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,840
Be good.

471
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,920
You go over to his house?

472
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,880
What? I went to see
if he had the money.

473
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,680
This guy's pumping coke, man. You
don't think he's being watched?

474
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,840
Use your head.

475
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,000
- I went there for two minutes.
- Yeah, well.

476
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,440
- That mine?
- Yeah.

477
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,640
Thanks. Hey, who
won the Celtics game?

478
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,560
- Cavs by eight.
- Fuck me.

479
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,360
- You bet those bums again?
- Yeah.

480
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,200
Fucking Celtics.

481
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,960
What'd you say?

482
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,480
- Who is that fucking guy? - I don't know.
I never saw him before, Brian.

483
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,680
What the fuck's
that guy named? Dave?

484
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,200
Hey, it's me.

485
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,400
Who is this? Matt?

486
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,080
Do me a favor, will you?

487
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,760
Cook me up some of that shit.
I'm coming over right now.

488
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,080
- Hey, you got something to say to me?
- I didn't say nothing to you.

489
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,960
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

490
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,280
Yeah.

491
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,120
So, Jay said something
about some steroid score.

492
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,680
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I got these guys, right?
- Fuck me.

493
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,280
- They got a lot of money.
- Yeah?

494
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,640
- A lot of money.
- What's the deal?

495
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,160
I'll set them up.

496
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,640
- Hey, they got a lot of money, you know.
- Okay.

497
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,040
Yeah.

498
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,680
- I think one of them is rich.
- Okay, dude.

499
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,800
What the fuck. Who's that?

500
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,520
- Who is it?
- Get away from me.

501
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,720
- Hey, how much money am I gonna get?
- Come on, man. Get off of me for a second.

502
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,840
You guys are gonna take care of
me with some of that money, right?

503
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,720
Matt, Matt, shut the fuck up.

504
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,120
- I just wanna know how much I'm gonna get.
- Matt, shut the fuck up!

505
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,480
- Matt, what the fuck's going on? Huh?
- Nothing.

506
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,800
How many times did
I fucking tell you?

507
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,920
- Brian.
- What?

508
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,640
This is my house. It's
3:00 in the morning.

509
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,080
- Come on.
- You're right. You're right. Sorry, Jay.

510
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,520
I'm sorry.

511
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,720
How many times did I
fucking tell you, Matt?

512
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,840
No one in the fucking house! Clean
the fuck up, you fucking clown!

513
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,760
Thanks, Charlie.

514
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,320
Look, one thing you gotta do is make sure
that he brings the money inside, all right?

515
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,840
Insist on that. Tell him that the steroids
are in the cellar in a cooler. All right?

516
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,560
Once he comes in, we'll take care
of the rest, all right? Right?

517
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,440
Yeah.

518
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,800
All right. What time are
you supposed to meet him?

519
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,440
2:00 on Thursday.

520
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,800
2:00. All right, at 2:30, we'll be in the
back at the sandwich counter, all right?

521
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,480
See you later, guys.

522
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,960
What happened to
you last night?

523
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,960
Nothing. I had to do
some stuff with Stacy.

524
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,840
We gotta be sharp on this.

525
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,960
Naturally.

526
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,760
- Hey, Matt.
- Yo, hey. Paulie.

527
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,080
- Hey, what's up.
- Yeah, good, good.

528
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,040
- How's everything going?
- Yeah, good. You want a seat?

529
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,520
- You want a sandwich or something?
- No, I think I'm okay.

530
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,320
- Well, you got the money?
- Yeah, do you have the juice?

531
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,600
Yeah, it's in the freezer.
Have a seat. Now, seriously...

532
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,240
- What, you want something?
- No, man, I'm okay. Why don't we...

533
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,240
- It's all right. It's all right. It's on me.
- No, believe me, I'm fine. I appreciate it.

534
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,040
You know what? You
guys just sit tight,

535
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,240
and I'll go grab the money,
all right? I'll be right back.

536
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,000
I told him to bring it in.

537
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,880
We told you to have him
bring the fucking money in!

538
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,520
I know, I told him, but
he was threatening me.

539
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,520
Get the fuck in the car!
Something's going on.

540
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,080
- Hurry up!
- Boston PD! Hey!

541
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,840
Put your hands up!
Hands on the dash!

542
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,720
Hey! Do not fucking move!

543
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,880
All right, here. Hands on
the... Give me the keys.

544
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,280
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Put your hands on the dash!

545
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,200
- You selling any drugs down here?
- No, sir.

546
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,600
So, you're down here
making a drug deal, huh?

547
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,640
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- Shut the fuck up!

548
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,120
Are you making drug
deals down here?

549
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,320
- No.
- Where's the money?

550
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,760
- Where's the money?
- What money?

551
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,800
- Where's the money?
- Shut the fuck up!

552
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,200
Joe, get an answer out of him!

553
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,440
Christ! We're not gonna get an
answer like that! Fucking prick!

554
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,120
- Shit! Where is the money?
- I don't know what you're talking about!

555
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,280
The fucking money!
Where's the money?

556
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,120
Oh, yeah. You don't know what I'm
talking about, huh? You lying prick.

557
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,400
Let's go!

558
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,280
What the fuck are
you looking at?

559
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,440
- Hey!
- Mind your fucking business!

560
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,240
- Somebody help us!
- Where's the key?

561
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,120
Hey, somebody help
us! Call a doctor!

562
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,080
Let me ask you something.
How old are you?

563
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,360
- I'll be 27 next week.
- No, you're not.

564
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,920
Fuck! She looks like
she's 22, don't she?

565
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,680
No, no, you look good.
You look really good.

566
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,840
- Thanks. Yeah, I gotta get back to work.
- No, sit down, sit down.

567
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,360
- Joe wants to talk to you.
- You're gonna get me fired.

568
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,640
I wanna talk to you.
I wanna talk to you.

569
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,960
No, you don't have to work. All right,
I'll come with you. I'll help you.

570
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,360
- Hey, Jay. How you doing?
- Brian, what's going on?

571
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,400
I want you to meet
my buddy, Josh.

572
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,600
Hey, Josh. How you doing?
Have a seat over here.

573
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,520
What, your boy run off
in the middle of a score?

574
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,080
- He does shit like that all the time, Brian.
- I'm sorry I took off, but you know...

575
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,560
What are you doing, running off on
a score? You don't have any balls?

576
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,040
No, I do, but it
was getting crazy.

577
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,840
- You were gonna kill those guys.
- I don't give a fuck!

578
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,480
Here. Here's a few bucks for you.
You're lucky you're getting that.

579
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,840
No, don't sit down
here! Get over there!

580
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,960
No, come on, sit down.
Man, I'm fucking with you.

581
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,040
Hey, can you get him a drink?

582
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,640
We need to talk.

583
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,160
- Come on, Jay.
- Listen, listen, relax.

584
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,720
What's going on?

585
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,440
What do you mean?

586
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,160
What do I mean?
I'm talking scores.

587
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,960
You just robbed two
guys up on E Street.

588
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,200
What are you
getting at, Jackie?

589
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,080
You two are out there on your
own, and we don't see a dime?

590
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,400
What do you want from us?

591
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,800
We been running around like a
couple of fucking errand boys for you

592
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,480
for 15 years, and what
do we have to show for it?

593
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,040
Nothing. All right, so we make
a few extra bucks on the side.

594
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,480
Errand boys? That's
how you see it?

595
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,760
That ain't the point, Jackie. I
got kids to feed, and I'm broke.

596
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,680
And we don't? Hey, Pat
is pissed about this.

597
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,480
You keep it up, you're
gonna have a problem.

598
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,440
- Are you threatening us?
- I don't threaten nobody.

599
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,120
All right, man, if that's the way
it is. I don't know what else to say.

600
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,000
That's the way it is.

601
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,040
- You need a ride home?
- No, I'm all set.

602
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,760
Hey, listen, I'm gonna be out
of here in about 15 minutes.

603
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,440
- I just gotta clean up.
- No, I'm fine, thanks. Here you go.

604
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,400
You motherfucker!

605
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,200
Motherfucker.

606
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,360
<i>Dr. Evans, dial 283.</i>

607
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,000
- Mrs. Reilly.
- Yes.

608
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,000
Hi.

609
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,160
Here's the situation.

610
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,920
As you know, your husband has
been struck by three bullets.

611
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,320
One is lodged in the back of his head,
one's been removed from his right shoulder,

612
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,560
and one from his left forearm.

613
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,080
The bullet in the
back of his head,

614
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,080
we have decided not to go ahead
with the surgery to remove it

615
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,560
because we feel it would be too
dangerous at this time, okay?

616
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,040
It's too close to
the spinal cord,

617
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,480
and it would be too dangerous to
go in and retrieve that bullet.

618
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,280
What we want to do is we want
to keep him here and observe him,

619
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,080
and we want to give him a lot of
antibiotics, and he should be okay.

620
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,640
We're very lucky that it was a
very small caliber bullet, so...

621
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,920
I do think you should know

622
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,080
that there were large traces of
cocaine and alcohol in his system.

623
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,400
He says he's gonna be fine.

624
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,360
I couldn't tell you. This
guy had a hood over his head.

625
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,720
- I couldn't see his face.
- Fuck him.

626
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,400
I just saw him standing
there with the pistol.

627
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,920
- Who do you think, if you had to say?
- I don't know. I couldn't say.

628
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,680
- Do you think it was that prick Jackie?
- I wish I knew. I really do.

629
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,680
- Hi.
- I'll be back.

630
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,560
- Hey. How are you?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

631
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,320
I'm all right. Come
on, give me a kiss.

632
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,960
- My God, I can't even get to you.
- Get over that thing.

633
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,880
Don't move your arm.

634
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,240
He's gonna be all right. I've got some
water right here for him if he wants.

635
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,760
- Stace, I'm gonna be right outside.
- Hi, Katie.

636
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,520
- The boys okay?
- They're fine.

637
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,480
- Are they okay?
- Yeah, they're good.

638
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,640
They're with my father. Don't worry
about anything. I gotta call work...

639
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,160
- No, no, no, I'm okay.
... get someone to cover for me.

640
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,080
- I'm just gonna go to sleep anyway.
- What, are you crazy? I can't.

641
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,960
You gotta get home. The
boys are gonna worry.

642
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,040
- Hey, Paulie.
- Hey, Hogie.

643
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,440
- How's Brian doing?
- I don't know. He's in the fucking hospital

644
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,800
with a shitload of holes in him.
How do you think he's doing, huh?

645
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,200
Did you see anything?

646
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,520
No, I was stocking the bar.
Brian was the last to go.

647
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,200
Ten minutes later, I
found him on the sidewalk.

648
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,400
Hey, Paulie, how's he doing?

649
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,760
Did you do it?

650
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,400
What are you, out of your
mind? I'm gonna shoot Brian?

651
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,680
Come on, I've known you
guys since you were kids.

652
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,160
Whatever you two were doing,
you brought this on yourselves.

653
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,040
So, how is he?

654
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,640
He's gonna live.

655
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,400
- I feel like I'm going fucking crazy.
- Come on, have a seat. Sit down.

656
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,960
Oh, no, sorry. You
had the roast beef.

657
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,760
This one's for him.

658
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,880
I can't even remember
a fucking order.

659
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,600
Thanks.

660
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,160
- How you doing?
- Pretty good. You?

661
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,440
Hey! Hey!

662
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,080
- Stace?
- Yeah?

663
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,440
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

664
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,560
Now, I know I've said this
before, but this has gotta stop.

665
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,520
- He's killing you with this shit.
- I know.

666
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,720
- You have got to get away from him.
- Katie, please, not now.

667
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,000
You know what? You say
this every single time,

668
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,280
- and every single time you go back...
- I got nowhere to go!

669
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,720
- Really?
- I got two kids!

670
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,880
- Oh, okay.
- Where am I gonna go?

671
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,680
You think you're the only person who's
ever been in this situation before?

672
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,760
- I can't hear this now.
- Stacy!

673
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,160
I'll call you later.

674
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,280
- Please push the button.
- I already pushed it.

675
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,560
There she is. Excuse me, nurse.
Can I please get some pain medicine?

676
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,760
You have an hour to go.

677
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,360
No, I don't have an hour to go.
I've already waited a fucking hour.

678
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,120
I want some pain
medicine, okay?

679
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,440
- You need to calm down.
- No, I don't need to calm down.

680
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,280
- I need to get some pain medicine.
- Brian, quiet!

681
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,120
- No, there's no reason...
- You just have to be patient.

682
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,320
There's no reason that I need to sit here
in pain. Now, can I just please have a...

683
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,400
Whatever you got. Just give
me a little bit of something.

684
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,600
- You need to just wait one more hour.
- I'm in fucking pain here, okay?

685
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,840
I don't know what it takes
for you to understand that!

686
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,080
- How long you been working here?
- This is my second week.

687
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,480
Right! Figures!

688
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,720
- Give me some fucking pain medicine!
- Brian! Brian, lower your voice.

689
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,320
- Now!
- I'll go get the doctor.

690
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,520
- Get the doctor!
- Look at you. Look at you.

691
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,920
- This is insane. What are you doing to us?
- Not right now, Stacy.

692
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,560
What about your boys? If
you're not gonna think about me,

693
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,760
- think about your boys.
- Not right fucking now!

694
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,280
Yes, now! You're a drug addict. You're
out every night doing coke, drinking.

695
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,160
This has gotta stop. You
promised me it was gonna stop!

696
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,800
- Get me the fuck...
- What are you doing?

697
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,200
- Brian, wait!
... out of here!

698
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,240
Brian, wait!

699
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,040
- What are you doing? No!
- Get the fuck away from me!

700
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,160
You can't leave.
Brian, you're gonna...

701
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,800
Brian, where are you going?

702
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,760
- Mr. Reilly, where are you going?
- Mind your own fucking business!

703
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,160
This is AMA, Mr...

704
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,040
- I don't give a fuck what you call it!
- Mr. Reilly!

705
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,040
You sit down!

706
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,120
- Brian! Brian, wait!
- Just leave me alone!

707
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,120
You're gonna freeze.
Hey! Somebody help.

708
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,560
He's barefoot!

709
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,720
Brian!

710
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,880
Matt, get him some
clothes, all right?

711
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,160
Get him some fucking clothes
before I fucking murder you!

712
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,040
Brian, get the fuck up!

713
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,320
What the fuck is this
crazy shit? Get the fuck up!

714
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,920
You're better than this,
bro, all right? Get up.

715
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,800
After all we been through,
you're gonna do this to me?

716
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,920
All right. Hey, you are stronger
than this! You look like shit.

717
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,600
- Get some... Where are the fucking clothes?
- Here. Here.

718
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,120
I don't ever want to
see you again. All right?

719
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,440
I don't ever want
to see you again!

720
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,880
You're so much better than this,
all right? Leave this shit alone.

721
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,360
This is what you're
gonna do to us, huh?

722
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,560
You're supposed
to have my back.

723
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,640
Let's go home. Let's
go home. Let's go home.

724
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,920
What, you're just gonna sit there
silent? You're not gonna say a thing?

725
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,320
I mean, come on, Stacy.
I had a lot going on.

726
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,560
I haven't touched
a thing in a week.

727
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,480
<i>What do you want me to do?
You're not gonna let me come home?</i>

728
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,920
I want to see my kids, Stacy.

729
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,840
I mean, how many times do I
have to say I'm sorry? I'm sorry.

730
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,320
<i>Sorry's not good
enough anymore.</i>

731
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,160
I got nothing to say. I
gotta go pick up the kids.

732
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,920
All right.

733
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,120
How you doing?
Stacy coming around?

734
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,280
I don't know. We're talking about
maybe going out to dinner. We'll see.

735
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,160
Anthony called me. He's got another
one of them truck scores lined up.

736
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,560
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

737
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:07,040
- I could sure use it.
- Can you drive one of them...

738
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,240
- Five speeds?
- Yeah.

739
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,120
- Sure.
- All right.

740
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,960
Hey, Mark. You gonna
throw that at me? Okay.

741
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,480
Not in the street.
Not in the street.

742
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,200
- Hey. How you doing?
- Doing good.

743
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,120
See you later, okay?
Give your dad a kiss.

744
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,400
I love you.

745
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,040
You ready?

746
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,360
Hey.

747
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:44,120
- So, what about dinner?
- Call me tomorrow.

748
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,360
- How much more room?
- I don't know. Looks good to me.

749
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,160
Here we go.

750
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,720
What'd I tell
you? Piece of cake.

751
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,120
Nice. Nice. Yeah.

752
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,200
- Talk to you guys later.
- Thanks.

753
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,680
Oh, fuck.

754
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,400
Hey, turn him around.

755
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,320
Do you remember me?

756
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,640
How about now?

757
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,080
Get him out of here.

758
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,520
- Hey, you Paulie McDougan?
- Yeah. Who are you?

759
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,000
Ronny Dents, from Dorchester.
You know Pat Kelly, right?

760
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,520
- Yeah.
- He'll be out in the yard at 1:00.

761
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,960
He wants to see you.

762
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,920
<i>Section 3 and 5, "A" block
on the yard in 15 minutes.</i>

763
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,080
<i>Section 3 and 5, "A" block
on the yard in 15 minutes.</i>

764
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,200
- That's Pat.
- I'll catch up.

765
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,200
Brian.

766
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,880
- Paulie.
- Hey, Pat.

767
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,400
- Small world.
- Yeah, yeah.

768
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,800
Five to seven, could be worse.

769
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,760
Come on. Let's walk.

770
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,800
- So, that's the thanks I get, huh?
- Pat...

771
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,120
Hey, look, I haven't lasted this
long by letting people fuck me.

772
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,280
The first chance you get,
you guys go out on your own.

773
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,560
- It wasn't like that, Pat.
- That's exactly how it was.

774
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,920
You don't think I know
what's going on out there?

775
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,720
Come on.

776
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,760
I give people one chance,
and you just had yours.

777
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,960
Don't ever fuck me again.

778
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,880
I was pretty good to you two.

779
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,240
Let's put this shit behind us.

780
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,120
We watch each
other's back in here.

781
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,600
- Fucking rat hole.
- It's good to see you, Pat.

782
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,520
It's good to see you, too.

783
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,600
I heard you two
were coming in.

784
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,480
Unfortunate, but I'm
just glad to see you.

785
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,040
Yeah, you, too, Pat.

786
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,760
And, you, you still fucking
everything out there, huh?

787
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,520
- Prospects ain't so good right now.
- You're all done for a while.

788
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:06,400
- You got enough.
- You better be all done for a while.

789
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,680
Hey, sign up for that
alcoholics meeting later.

790
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,760
Okay, yeah, all right.

791
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,400
Hey, I'm Ray. I'm an alcoholic.
It's good to be here tonight.

792
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,520
And you remember
when we first met,

793
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,880
I said, " Look, let's
get the cigarette book,

794
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,360
"everything that helps
the clock go fast. "

795
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,840
- Yeah, right.
- Right, it kills time.

796
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,160
But then when we
take the cash bets,

797
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,360
and they wanna bet $500
or $1,000 a game, right,

798
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,760
then they think they can give us
the old check-in-the-mail story.

799
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,920
Well, we cut them off.
Who needs the aggravation?

800
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,120
I'll see you back there.

801
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,320
...for the people in my network, I'm
able to stay sober one day at a time.

802
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,080
Thanks for coming.

803
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,240
Sure.

804
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,800
- You look good.
- Thanks.

805
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,160
- How are the boys?
- They're all right.

806
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,640
Mark wrote you some letters,
but they confiscated them.

807
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,360
How are you doing?

808
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,240
Considering I was just
frisked, I'm doing great.

809
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,760
Look, you gotta help me
out a little bit here, okay?

810
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,160
- Give you some help?
- Yeah.

811
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:11,160
I know the situation that I put you
in. I feel bad about it, believe me.

812
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,160
But there's nothing I
can do about that now.

813
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,080
If you want to move
on, I'd understand.

814
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,960
Move on? Move on where?

815
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,760
Move on where? You
got an option for me?

816
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,760
I'm just telling you
it's okay. I'd understand.

817
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,760
I gotta raise your sons.

818
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,440
It's not like you
were ever there.

819
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,240
Not like I was ever there. What, you
gonna start taking shots at me now?

820
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,440
If it weren't for my
father, we'd be homeless.

821
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,880
So what do you wanna do?

822
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,800
I don't know.

823
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,760
Do you still love me?

824
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,440
Do you ever find yourself
getting tired of all this?

825
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,600
What, doing time? Fuck yeah.

826
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,880
No, the whole thing,
you know. Just the grind.

827
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,360
Always chasing after a buck, trying
to be one step ahead of the cops.

828
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,880
We're just playing
the cards we're dealt.

829
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,000
I suck as a father.

830
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,880
What?

831
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,920
Brian, come on. I mean, I'm
not gonna shit you, all right.

832
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,440
You're not gonna win Father of the Year,
all right? You're not. It's over, you know.

833
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,480
But your kids
love you. They do.

834
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,120
They got it better than
we did, all right? They do.

835
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,360
They got a good mom.
They're good. They love you.

836
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,240
- You really think they do?
- I know they do, all right?

837
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,200
Someday you're gonna make all
this up to them. All right?

838
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,600
Hey, hey, look at this guy up here. All
right? You see who I'm talking about?

839
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:52,200
He's doing 35 for an armored car,
all right? So, things could be worse.

840
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,280
Yeah, things could be worse.

841
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,040
<i>Prison is the most boring
waste of time you can imagine.</i>

842
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,760
<i>Yesterday is the
same as tomorrow.</i>

843
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:29,600
<i>A bunch of cowards hiding
behind muscles and tattoos,</i>

844
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,000
<i>the most dangerous kind,
people filled with fear.</i>

845
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,760
<i>All I ever think about is how
I let you and the kids down.</i>

846
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,000
<i>I miss you. I'm sorry.</i>

847
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,440
So I got that number to them guys
when you get out. They're good guys.

848
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,440
I drank away my wife.

849
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,040
It was hell, but that's
what the booze does.

850
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,800
Jesus Christ, that's Danny Sullivan.
I haven't seen him in 15 years.

851
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,240
Oh, yeah. He was friends
with my uncle, right?

852
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,520
Yeah, he was. He looks great.

853
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,760
Twenty years ago, I was
sitting right where you are.

854
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,200
Anyways, what else you got?

855
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,360
I was able to get
a handle on it.

856
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,240
I was able to get a little
piece of my life back.

857
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,240
- Hey, you with us?
- Yeah, yeah.

858
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,840
Once again, my name is Dan. I'm an
alcoholic. Thanks for letting me talk.

859
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,560
All right, everybody
back to the block!

860
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,800
Hey, Sully. I'm Brian Reilly. I
met you when I was a little kid.

861
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:31,240
Bobby's nephew. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. He was a good man.

862
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,080
Yeah, he was. Thanks.

863
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,640
So, you hear anything
that made sense?

864
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,160
Yeah. A few things, yeah.

865
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,320
How much time you got left?

866
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,360
- Just a couple weeks and I'm out.
- Good, good.

867
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,480
You planning on staying sober?

868
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:53,480
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- You got any meetings lined up?

869
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,080
I've never been to a meeting
before I come in here,

870
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,760
and that was just
to get off the block.

871
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,720
If you ever want to go
to a meeting or just talk,

872
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,600
- give me a call. - All right, Brian,
let's go. Time to go back.

873
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,120
Just one minute.

874
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:08,400
- All right. Thanks, Sully.
- You bet.

875
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,160
Hey, Paulie.

876
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,280
Remember that scumbag child
molester we saw on TV last week?

877
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,520
- Yeah.
- I'm putting him in cell 12.

878
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,480
Thanks, Callahan.

879
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
let's go! Let's do it.

880
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,160
What the fuck?

881
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,000
Come here a second. Come here.

882
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:59,360
You fucking... You take
the pain, you fucking freak.

883
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,880
You like fucking kids? You
fucking rape fucking kids!

884
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,920
What's wrong with
you? Come on, come on.

885
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:25,000
You eat like a fucking animal.

886
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,760
Don't start, Paulie.

887
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,600
Here they are.

888
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,360
All right, let's go.

889
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,560
- Enjoy yourself.
- Thanks.

890
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,440
Eat however you want.

891
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,720
How you doing?

892
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,000
<i>All right, let's
get right to it.</i>

893
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:45,120
We all know you did it.
Personally, I don't give a shit,

894
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,280
but Sergeant Callahan may lose his
job. He's already been suspended.

895
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:52,680
I know he's been good to you two,
newspapers, privileges, whatnot.

896
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,680
I got the D.A. all
over my ass on this one.

897
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,840
As sick as these bastards
are, they're protected.

898
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,520
- What are you looking for?
- Well, if somebody came forward,

899
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:05,840
we could make this go away and
save everyone a lot of aggravation.

900
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,200
Callahan's a good man.

901
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,440
So what are we looking at?

902
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,480
Six more months or
90 days in the hole.

903
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,040
It was me.

904
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,120
- What?
- Just you?

905
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,240
- Yeah, just me.
- Wait a second.

906
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,160
- Come on. You'd do the same for me.
- You don't have to do that.

907
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,360
- Say hi to the boys.
- Paul.

908
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,800
- Just you?
- Just me.

909
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,560
It's the right thing, Brian.
Come on, you'd do the same thing.

910
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,200
What, so the boys,
they didn't wanna come?

911
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,120
No, they wanted to.
Mark's still sick.

912
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,800
Sean'll come around. You're
gonna have to work on it though.

913
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:40,960
So...

914
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,040
What do you plan on doing?

915
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,080
I'm not sure yet.

916
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,680
- You're gonna get a job, right?
- Yeah, I'm gonna get something,

917
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,360
but first I want to just spend
some time with you and the kids.

918
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,800
Stacy, take a good
look around here

919
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:01,800
'cause I will never ever put you
and the boys in this situation again.

920
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:07,320
You'll never see me like this
again, ever. I promise you.

921
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,680
Hey, Callahan. So this
is where they got you.

922
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,560
Yeah, well, it could've
been a lot worse, huh?

923
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,080
Yeah. I appreciate everything you did
for us. You're all right, Callahan.

924
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,600
- Take care out there, Brian.
- Thanks.

925
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,360
Hey, buddy!

926
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,800
I missed you. Let me
see. Let me see you.

927
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,560
Give me a look. Hey,
where's your brother?

928
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,160
- He went to go meet his girlfriend.
- He'll be home later.

929
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,520
He did? Do you have
any girlfriends?

930
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,560
- I have two, actually.
- Not bad, not bad.

931
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,440
- Hey, Katie.
- Hey.

932
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,160
- How've you been?
- Good. Welcome back.

933
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,760
Good to see you.

934
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,040
Thanks for watching
them for us.

935
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,640
Your brother went to
see his girlfriend, huh?

936
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,920
Yeah, he'll be
back later though.

937
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,680
What happened
to Coynes Tavern?

938
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,360
They made it into
condos two years ago.

939
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,960
All these yuppies are moving in buying
up everything. Rents are unbelievable.

940
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,160
Everything's changing.

941
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:50,440
So now you gotta be rich
to live in South Boston.

942
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,400
So we are.

943
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,600
Mark told me you
have a girlfriend.

944
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,920
- Yeah? Is she pretty?
- Very pretty.

945
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,880
This is pretty good.

946
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,160
- Pretty good?
- Yeah, pretty good.

947
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:11,080
- What's her name?
- Stephanie.

948
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,880
I'd like to meet her sometime.

949
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,360
I gotta go. I'll
see you later.

950
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,280
- You don't wanna finish?
- No.

951
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,240
Not too late, Sean. Sean?

952
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,880
All right, I'll
see you, buddy.

953
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,080
Wow.

954
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,280
You don't have to say that.

955
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,080
Oh, my God.

956
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:39,120
Come on, you're gonna be late,
and your ma is gonna kill me.

957
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,360
- I miss you, man.
- All right. Bye.

958
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,040
All right. I put a
cupcake in your lunch.

959
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,560
All right. Thanks, Dad. Bye.

960
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,200
I love you, Mark.

961
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,000
I love you, too.

962
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,720
What?

963
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,880
What are you banging on the
door like you're the cops for?

964
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,240
- Do you know you're $600 overdue?
- Yeah, I do now.

965
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,200
We sent you three notices, so
unless you make a payment...

966
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,360
Hey, you seem to be taking
this pretty personal.

967
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,880
What, is the money coming
out of your own pocket?

968
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,960
Just doing my job.

969
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,800
Well, some people don't have a
job that pays 52 checks a year.

970
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

971
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,440
Listen, you either pay the money, or
I'm gonna have to shut your gas off.

972
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,480
Hey.

973
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,760
- You ain't shutting off a fucking thing.
- Relax.

974
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,760
Now, you get back in your
little truck, and you drive away

975
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,560
before I bash your
fucking head in.

976
01:01:23,561 --> 01:01:25,800
- Take it easy, okay?
- No, no. Get going.

977
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:29,160
Call the cops. Do what you
have to do. I'll find you.

978
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,840
Hey, hey. Wait a second.

979
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,120
Now look what you got me
doing in front of my wife.

980
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:40,080
Now, shake my hand, and smile at
her like everything's all right.

981
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,320
Give her a little wave.

982
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,120
Now, write down on a piece of
paper where I can make a payment.

983
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:47,720
Okay.

984
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,120
Thanks. Have a nice day.

985
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:55,480
He gave me a number where
I can make a payment.

986
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:59,200
- I can't ask my father for no more money.
- I'll see what I can do.

987
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,080
You mean like a job?

988
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,280
I only been out for two days.
I need you to give me a chance.

989
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,240
No, no, no. I just
meant, you know...

990
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,280
- What?
- Never mind.

991
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,200
- Hey.
- Look who it is.

992
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,440
- All right.
- Good to see you.

993
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:20,480
You, too, Jackie.

994
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,240
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

995
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,800
- Look at you. You lost a bundle of weight.
- Yeah, I did.

996
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,320
How does it feel to be home?

997
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,800
- Different.
- Yeah, yeah, I know that feeling.

998
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,680
So Pat said there was
an envelope for me.

999
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:33,240
- I got it right here. Hold on.
- Thanks, Jackie.

1000
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,200
So, you want a drink?
Maybe something to eat?

1001
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,280
No, no, no. I'm all right.

1002
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,040
- You've been staying in shape, huh?
- You know, hitting the bag a little.

1003
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,120
- Attaboy.
- Thanks.

1004
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,360
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1005
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,360
All right.

1006
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:51,720
Come on, have a seat.
Have something to eat.

1007
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,600
- Sit down, relax.
- I'm okay, Jackie.

1008
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,880
- Hey, listen, I got a few things to do.
- All right.

1009
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,640
Thanks.

1010
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,960
- All right. Hey, good to see you, Brian.
- I'll be seeing you soon, Jackie.

1011
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,680
I got the pizza. Here you go.

1012
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,040
- Yes, pizza!
- Nice.

1013
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,800
Here you go. Dig in.

1014
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,160
Pay the gas bill. Pay it.

1015
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:24,440
- Where did you get this?
- I went down to see Jackie about a job.

1016
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,520
He lent me a few bucks.

1017
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,480
Come on, dig in. What
are you waiting for?

1018
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,200
- Hey, Sean, how you doing, buddy?
- Pretty good.

1019
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,600
All right, listen, Stace,
he gave me a two-word answer!

1020
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,480
I'll get it.

1021
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,680
How is that?

1022
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,680
Brian!

1023
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,720
What's up?

1024
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,720
Go be with the kids.

1025
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,000
What? What's going on?

1026
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,240
I just came by to welcome
you back to the neighborhood.

1027
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,400
You got a warrant?

1028
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,520
Why? You do something wrong?

1029
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,360
Yeah, okay. Could you
step outside, please?

1030
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:10,920
Thanks.

1031
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,640
Don't come in my
house without a reason.

1032
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,280
Like I said, I just
came to welcome you back.

1033
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,880
Cute. I got it.

1034
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,480
Hey, Jackie, did
you talk to that guy?

1035
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:29,000
<i>He says nothing's open right
now. Hey, maybe in a month or two.</i>

1036
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,680
All right, thanks.

1037
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:32,880
Any luck?

1038
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,280
Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna
go see him right now.

1039
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,320
- Right now?
- Yeah.

1040
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,640
All right.

1041
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,520
Hey, Brian. How you doing?

1042
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,520
- I'm all right. What's your name?
- Dave.

1043
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,400
My little brother plays baseball with
your son, Sean. He's a good player.

1044
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:07,840
Yeah, thanks.

1045
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,920
- You work for the city?
- Yeah.

1046
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,400
How's that?

1047
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,240
- Not bad.
- How do you get a job like that?

1048
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,000
- You remember Jimmy Kelly, right?
- Yeah.

1049
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:21,120
He got me the job. Otherwise I'd have
to wait in line with 40,000 other people.

1050
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,640
There's the boss. All right.

1051
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,360
I gotta go buy him lunch
to get him off my back.

1052
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,080
Have a good day.

1053
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,960
And that's my story of how
I ended up at these meetings.

1054
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,160
I'd like to thank you for
letting me speak tonight.

1055
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,440
And I'd like to end this
meeting, as we do all of them,

1056
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,720
with the Lord's
Prayer, please.

1057
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:48,280
And in the name of the
Father and of the Son

1058
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:50,600
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

1059
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,960
"Our Father who art in
Heaven Hallowed be thy name"

1060
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,640
- All that praying and stuff threw me.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

1061
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,480
I felt the same way
when I first came around.

1062
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:12,640
I want you to trust me on this.
For now, you just show up with me.

1063
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:14,880
If you have trouble
sitting through a meeting,

1064
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,640
you just remember
where you were.

1065
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:22,760
That always helped me. Come
on. I'll give you a ride home.

1066
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,920
Now, I'm gonna try
to find you some work.

1067
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,040
Excuse me. You Jerry?

1068
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:38,320
- Yeah. How you doing?
- My name's Brian.

1069
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,160
Sully might have called
you about some work.

1070
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,520
Brian. Oh, Brian, yeah,
yeah. Sully called me.

1071
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,160
- How are you doing? You all right?
- I'm good. Yeah.

1072
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,440
- Yeah. You looking for a little work?
- Yeah, you got something?

1073
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,480
Okay.

1074
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,160
Yeah, well, you know,
you see what we got here.

1075
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,560
Not much, but, you know,
we can keep you busy.

1076
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:54,560
- That'll work for me.
- All right, let me get the card.

1077
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,480
- Here's a card. Here you go.
- Yeah.

1078
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,440
You give me a call, we'll do
what we can. All right, brother?

1079
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,520
- I appreciate it. I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay. You got it.

1080
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,280
Hut one, hut two. Hike!

1081
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,920
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi,

1082
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,360
three Mississippi, four
Mississippi, five Mississippi.

1083
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:09,920
Yeah.

1084
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:49,840
Hello?

1085
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,880
<i>Hi, this is Sister Flora from Saint
Brigitte's. Is this Mr. Reilly?</i>

1086
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:55,400
Yes, Sister.

1087
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:58,400
<i>Mr. Reilly, I'm calling in
regards to Mark's tuition.</i>

1088
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,720
<i>As of now, you're
three payments behind.</i>

1089
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,840
Yes, Sister, I realize that.

1090
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:07,080
I'm just starting a new job here,
so we've just been playing catch-up.

1091
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:10,160
<i>We're well aware of your
situation, Mr. Reilly,</i>

1092
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:13,960
<i>but we need to bring this to your
attention before the school year ends.</i>

1093
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:16,560
Okay. I realize
that, Sister, but...

1094
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,560
I'll take care of it, okay?

1095
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,080
<i>Very good. God bless you.</i>

1096
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,560
Yeah, you, too.

1097
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:34,440
- Hey, Jerry, what's up?
- Brian, I tried to catch you at home.

1098
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,440
I got nothing for you
today. Call me tomorrow.

1099
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,120
Okay. All right.

1100
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,680
Hey, Freddie.
Freddie, how you doing?

1101
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,680
- How's it going?
- Hey, good to see you. Good to see you.

1102
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:53,720
Yeah.

1103
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,760
- Hey, what's that? You gotta kill the ball!
- Hey!

1104
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,280
- How you doing? Welcome back.
- Good.

1105
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,320
- So can I step in?
- Come on in.

1106
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,320
- Hey, who's your partner?
- Vinnie and Kevin.

1107
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,360
Kevin. Hey, how you
doing? Can I step in?

1108
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,560
- Yeah.
- Yeah, take a rest.

1109
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,480
- Hey, Paulie.
- Joe Biggs. How are you?

1110
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:12,840
Hey, Tony! Put $100 on us, all right?
I just got out of handball school.

1111
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,720
It's a safe bet. All right.

1112
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,600
All right. Serve
it up, let's go!

1113
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,640
All right.

1114
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:25,360
Can you believe that prick
Pat, huh? $500, he gives us.

1115
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,600
I couldn't believe it, either.

1116
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,000
What about Stacy and
the kids? They good?

1117
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,760
They're good, yeah.

1118
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,920
How about money,
huh? You making any?

1119
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,520
Yeah, you know, picking up
some stuff here and there,

1120
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,720
just spending time with the kids,
trying to do the right thing.

1121
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,080
It's tough out here, you know?

1122
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:47,800
- It's good to be out though, you know?
- Yeah.

1123
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,240
It'd be a lot
nicer with money.

1124
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,840
- Hey, Paulie! When'd you get out, huh?
- You forget about me?

1125
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:02,600
- No. How could I forget about you, Paulie?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1126
01:11:02,601 --> 01:11:04,440
So you got my money then?

1127
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:08,120
Well, not right now, but give
me a couple of months and...

1128
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,280
A couple of months?
You greedy prick!

1129
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:13,880
I've been down for five years, and
you haven't sent me a fucking dime!

1130
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:16,280
I'm gonna go outside,
and I'm gonna count to 20,

1131
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:20,240
and when I come back in, there's
gonna be two grand on this counter.

1132
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:32,040
Do yourself a favor, Burt, throw
some cash up on that counter.

1133
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:42,840
- How we doing?
- Here, here, here.

1134
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,200
Yeah. Hey.

1135
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,160
Hey, see you.

1136
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,320
What the fuck, Paul? You haven't
even changed your clothes yet.

1137
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:54,360
- Relax.
- He's a cheap prick.

1138
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:57,680
What are we gonna do, starve
out here? Let's go see the kids.

1139
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:02,480
- Fucking crazy.
- How do you like this car?

1140
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,600
- What do you think?
- I don't know. I don't know.

1141
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:09,040
- She didn't know that he was married.
- Hi, Stacy.

1142
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,040
- Paulie!
- How are you doing?

1143
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:13,920
- When did you get out?
- A couple hours ago.

1144
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,480
- Oh, yeah? You look good.
- Thanks, doll.

1145
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,920
- How you been?
- Okay. I'm okay now.

1146
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:21,000
- How you doing? You look good.
- Hey, Paulie, they let you out, huh?

1147
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,840
Nice to see you, too, Katie.
You're still single, I bet.

1148
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,320
- Oh, yeah. Fuck you, Paulie.
- Come on, give me a kiss.

1149
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:26,480
- Mark.
- Mark.

1150
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,440
- Coming, Dad.
- Come here.

1151
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,440
This is Mark.

1152
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,320
- That's not Mark. That's Mark?
- Yeah, that's Mark.

1153
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,440
- Look at the fucking size of
this kid. - Hey, wait! The F-bomb!

1154
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,480
No, no, no!

1155
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,840
- What a football player you're gonna be.
- Baseball.

1156
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,640
- Baseball.
- You remember your Uncle Paul?

1157
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,560
- Yeah. He got me my first football.
- Supper's ready.

1158
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,440
That's right. That's right,
I got him his first football.

1159
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:48,240
Oh, no. You know, we're heading right
out. I gotta get Paulie situated.

1160
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,920
You don't want a burger?
I'll have a burger.

1161
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,080
- You got...
- Just grab one.

1162
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,480
- Wait.
- I can cook up another one.

1163
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,280
- Just have him put a top on one.
- Yeah...

1164
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,720
Can I grab this
one? Pretty good.

1165
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:58,960
- Yeah, help yourself.
- Thank you.

1166
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,480
Mark, wash your hands.

1167
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:01,760
- You want to come with us, Mark?
- Okay.

1168
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,120
I'm just kidding.

1169
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:08,040
- Chivas on the rocks.
- Can I get a soda water?

1170
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:11,400
- What's with the soda water?
- I'm taking it easy.

1171
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,080
Well, what do you think?

1172
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:18,400
I don't know. I don't like anything
that Jackie and Pat are behind lately.

1173
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:21,880
Thanks. Me, neither, but let's
just hear them out, all right?

1174
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:24,680
Hey, boys, this is Eddie.
He'll give you all the details.

1175
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:27,960
Hey, there. You want a
drink? You want a drink?

1176
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:31,040
- No, I'm good, thanks.
- Yeah, all right. Okay.

1177
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,520
- Sully came by last night.
- Oh, yeah?

1178
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,720
I'll give him a call later.

1179
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:43,760
- What's this?
- I left you a few bucks.

1180
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,960
- Where did you get it?
- Come on.

1181
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:48,200
What, are you gonna question
every dollar I give you?

1182
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:51,560
You're like a fucking parole
officer. Relax, will you?

1183
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:53,320
I gotta go.

1184
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,240
Tell me again, how much
money is in that safe?

1185
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,720
- Forty grand.
- Forty grand.

1186
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,720
- And that's definitely him?
- Yeah, that's definitely him.

1187
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:06,080
- I'd know that fat fuck anywhere.
- All right, let's do it.

1188
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,880
Get in the truck, you fat fuck,
before I put a hole in you.

1189
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,240
Get in the fucking truck!

1190
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,440
Open the fucking door. Get
in. We're going to your house.

1191
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:21,600
We're gonna clean
out your safe. Get in!

1192
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,520
Wave to them kids.

1193
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,160
There you go.

1194
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:52,840
Paulie, I don't know
what to tell you.

1195
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,400
There was supposed to
be 40 grand in the box.

1196
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:55,640
- Shut the fuck up!
- What's the matter?

1197
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:57,480
- What happened?
- 2,700 fucking dollars.

1198
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,040
That's it? Eddie, what
the fuck's going on here?

1199
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,880
Jackie, I know, there was
supposed to be 40 grand in the box.

1200
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,280
- Hey, Eddie, you
guaran-fucking-teed it! - I know.

1201
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:05,960
Hey, here's your $700, all
right? We're keeping the rest.

1202
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,360
Broad fucking
daylight, Jackie,

1203
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:12,480
and, for the record, we are done
risking our asses for you and Pat.

1204
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,360
- You can both go fuck yourselves.
- Is that right, Paulie?

1205
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,480
- Yeah, that's right!
- Hey, what do I get, Paulie?

1206
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:30,440
Here, pay the tuition.

1207
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:34,440
What is this? What is this?
You just don't get it, do you?

1208
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:36,960
- I am not paying any bills with that money!
- What do you want from me?

1209
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,760
- What the fuck do you want from me?
- Do you think I'm stupid?

1210
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,080
- When are you gonna realize...
- What? Shut up!

1211
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,240
God damn it! Do you
think 'cause I'm sober...

1212
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,960
- Do you think 'cause I'm...
- You just...

1213
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:47,720
Do you think 'cause I'm sober, they're
gonna start sending me envelopes?

1214
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:50,480
- When are you gonna listen to me?
- Get off me!

1215
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,000
- You better listen to me!
- What do you want me to say?

1216
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,440
When are you gonna realize
your kids need a father!

1217
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,120
This is who I
am! It's who I am!

1218
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:58,920
Yeah, go ahead, run.
That's what you do best.

1219
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,920
- It's who I am!
- Slam the door, too!

1220
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,240
Yeah, that's it. Go ahead.

1221
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,840
- What? I think I'm in love.
- Oh, really?

1222
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,640
I've known you what,
eight, nine minutes?

1223
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:20,480
- So? Don't you want to...
- So?

1224
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:24,320
- Nicole, don't go there. Don't go there.
- What? What's wrong? We're just talking.

1225
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:28,680
You're a young girl. Do not
go falling for a guy like me.

1226
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,640
- It's not...
- I like bad boys.

1227
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:33,000
Yeah, you're too young to
know what you like, all right?

1228
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:36,680
And all that bad-boy stuff,
that's great, real exciting.

1229
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,440
You got some good stories
to tell your friends,

1230
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:41,920
and then you end up curled up
in a ball when they leave you.

1231
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,200
- Is that what you think?
- Drop it, Nicole.

1232
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:46,600
We're just hanging out.
I'm having a great time,

1233
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:49,880
but if that don't work for
you, then you gotta tell me.

1234
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:51,240
All right?

1235
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,760
You know what? I just remembered,
I got some place I gotta be.

1236
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,840
I get it. I'll go.

1237
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,800
Where were you? I waited
for you, and then I just...

1238
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,920
I know. Yeah, I got tied up.

1239
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:36,600
I know what we can do, because
I'm done with this bullshit.

1240
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,480
Oh, yeah? What's that?

1241
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:41,200
I clocked an
armored truck today.

1242
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,240
- Brian.
- Come on.

1243
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,400
What? Every time I mention it
to you, you say it's impossible.

1244
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:47,440
Everyone gets caught.

1245
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,760
That's 'cause they're all
high on junk, all right?

1246
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,200
They got wet brain. We're
gonna do it different.

1247
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:52,040
- Come on, will you, Paul?
- I'm not fucking around, Brian.

1248
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:55,200
Okay? No, I'm done with this grind.
What are we gonna do? Get a job, huh?

1249
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:58,520
It's like standing in mud. 30
years go by, and you're dead.

1250
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,360
You wanna live like that?

1251
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,960
All I'm asking is check it out.
If we don't like it, we walk.

1252
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,120
How's it going, guys?

1253
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,160
I see you're out
getting some exercise.

1254
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:12,960
- Is that a crime?
- No.

1255
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:15,000
Robbing someone
at gunpoint is.

1256
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,760
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yeah, I'm sure you don't.

1257
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,240
Good thing for you two,
the fat man didn't flip.

1258
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,920
But don't worry, they all
do eventually. Just ask Pat.

1259
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,360
- Okay.
- Brian.

1260
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:26,800
Can I ask you a question?

1261
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:31,160
I'm out here, I'm trying to do the right
thing, and everywhere I go, you're all over me.

1262
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,400
So what's it gonna take? When
are you gonna let that go?

1263
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:34,480
It was five years ago.

1264
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:39,040
How about you toss me a beating for an
hour or two, and then we call it even.

1265
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:49,760
You see what I'm
talking about, huh?

1266
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:53,480
We're gonna be dodging pricks like
that for the rest of our lives.

1267
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:58,600
Alls we need is a little bit of padding,
and then we can do whatever we want.

1268
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,680
What do you think?

1269
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:13,040
- Aren't there usually three?
- Yeah, that's why it's perfect.

1270
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:16,400
All we have to do is get
one of them, and we own them.

1271
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,200
- What?
- I don't know, Paulie.

1272
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:23,640
- What?
- This is some cowboy shit, man.

1273
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,240
No. I know we
can pull this off.

1274
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,440
Let's go.

1275
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,000
This is the spot.

1276
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:57,120
All right, we got three
exits. It's their last stop.

1277
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,680
They'll be fully
loaded. This is it.

1278
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:04,920
You all right?

1279
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:07,920
Look, Brian,

1280
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:12,280
if you don't wanna do it, I'll
understand. I'll get another guy.

1281
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:13,920
I need the money.

1282
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,760
Well, it's your call.

1283
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,080
Hey, buddy.

1284
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:28,920
- Hey.
- Is Ma home?

1285
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:30,840
She went for a walk.

1286
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,960
Sorry about the blow
up with Ma last week.

1287
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:47,600
I just been having a...

1288
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,120
I've just been having
a tough time adjusting.

1289
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,000
We haven't talked much.

1290
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:06,400
I been trying to give
you a little time.

1291
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,760
You got every right to be mad.
I just don't want you to hate me.

1292
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:15,320
I don't hate you.
You're my father.

1293
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:25,240
Sean, I'm really proud of you
and the way you carry yourself

1294
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:30,000
and what you've done in school
and with your life, and...

1295
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,520
Sean, I guess I just wanna
know what it's gonna take

1296
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:40,360
to get you to respect me
the way that I respect you.

1297
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:49,280
Just stop drinking
and don't leave us.

1298
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:01,240
Yeah, yeah, just...

1299
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,960
What's up, Sean?

1300
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,440
Anyway, so I'll pop out,
right? I get the drop on them.

1301
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:31,720
- And what do you do?
- Pop the trunk.

1302
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,720
Pop the trunk.
Boom, there it is.

1303
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,000
What's this?

1304
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:40,560
Hold on a second.

1305
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,880
- How you doing?
- Hey, Sully.

1306
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:55,520
I haven't heard from you.

1307
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,440
Yeah, me and Stacy had a beef,
so I've been staying with Paul.

1308
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:00,440
Yeah, yeah, she called me.

1309
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:03,400
- She called you? For what?
- She's worried.

1310
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:08,720
Sorry about that.
She's paranoid.

1311
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,040
- You been using?
- No.

1312
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:18,560
She told me you're
out making money.

1313
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:21,960
I'm fucking broke.
Making money?

1314
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:28,080
You wanna go back to prison
and abandon your kids again?

1315
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:30,560
'Cause that's where
you're gonna go.

1316
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:35,040
Keep going down the same road,
you end up in the same place.

1317
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:38,560
- Yeah, well, maybe that's where I belong.
- Is that what you want?

1318
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:43,320
The easy way out? Prison, three
squares a day, no responsibilities?

1319
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:47,640
Funny, you didn't
strike me as a quitter.

1320
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,280
I can't make it out here.

1321
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,000
You know, I sit in that...

1322
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:06,640
Sit in that cell with all these
hopes and dreams of my life,

1323
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:10,080
and it's fucking bullshit.

1324
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:14,720
Who am I kidding?
It's impossible for me.

1325
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:21,280
And nobody loves their
kids more than I do. Nobody.

1326
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:26,560
But I look at them, I see
nothing but victims. My victims.

1327
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,760
I can't give them
anything, nothing,

1328
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:34,000
let alone what they deserve.

1329
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:37,320
Just...

1330
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,640
It's okay. Go
ahead. Let it out.

1331
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:50,080
It took me 50 years
to learn real men cry.

1332
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:59,400
Today Sean asked me to stay
sober and not ever go away again.

1333
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:00,560
Man...

1334
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:05,960
It scared the fuck out of me because I
don't think it's anything that I can do.

1335
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:07,920
A day at a time, you can.

1336
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:11,720
I'll tell you something, they'd
be better off without me, really.

1337
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,120
They would.

1338
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:16,560
I just screw everything up
when I come around, anyway.

1339
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,720
Let's do it. Fuck this.

1340
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,320
Get down! Get down!

1341
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:24,040
- Get down! Get down!
- Get your hands up.

1342
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,560
There you go.

1343
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:28,240
- Fuck!
- Nice and easy. Nobody gets hurt.

1344
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:31,000
We don't need any heroes.

1345
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,760
Police! Freeze!

1346
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:36,360
- Freeze!
- Let's go!

1347
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,160
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1348
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:46,120
- Let's go!
- Drop your weapon! Now! I said now!

1349
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:48,280
What are you doing? Get in!

1350
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,720
- Get in the car!
- Let's go! Move!

1351
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:53,040
Go, go, go, go!

1352
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:49,080
Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit.

1353
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:51,360
Where you been?

1354
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,920
- I went for a walk.
- Yeah? You hungry?

1355
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,160
Thanks.

1356
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:00,680
This chick I've been seeing is making
these unbelievable pancakes, all right?

1357
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:04,040
You're gonna want one of
these suckers. All right.

1358
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:13,760
What's up? You all right?

1359
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:18,680
Yeah.

1360
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:24,560
I don't know what, she taught
me a little something, but...

1361
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,400
These fucking things are good.

1362
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,160
What's up?

1363
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:39,760
I...

1364
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:53,040
I can't go, Paulie.

1365
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:55,840
I gotta take a
pass for my boys.

1366
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,480
Don't worry, all
right? I seen it coming.

1367
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:05,480
You know, I got a guy ready.
But I gotta tell you something.

1368
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:12,280
I'm getting away with it.
There's not a doubt in my mind.

1369
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:16,880
I'm retiring on this one. I'm not
going back to prison for no one.

1370
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,640
You can bet on that.

1371
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:22,440
I guess there's no chance I
could talk you out of it then.

1372
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:27,360
It's not gonna be the same.

1373
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:30,600
- I understand, Brian.
- Paul.

1374
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:34,280
Come on, you got kids.
It's good. It's good.

1375
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:38,920
Come on.

1376
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:45,160
I understand, all right.

1377
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:56,640
<i>Topping today's news, a brazen
broad-daylight armored-car robbery.</i>

1378
01:29:56,680 --> 01:30:00,760

1379

undetermined amount of cash.</i>

1380

1381
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:07,800
<i>His condition is unknown.</i>

1382
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,240
Good job.
