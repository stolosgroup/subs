-It's not an act. I really...
-Over here.

318

-Ma'am.
-Oh, footmen?

319
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:02,893
GRANT: Okay. The viewing numbers are in,
folks, and they are not a pretty read.

320
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,270
I mean, look at this. We're still in...
(SMACKS LIPS)

321

-I don't know how to read this.
-Fifth place.

322
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:10,442
Fifth, like five?
There are only four news shows.

323
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:13,612
Okay, I could try
a different shade of spray tan.

324
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:15,989
No, no, ever since we switched you
to coconut glow,

325
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:18,158
you are killing it
with teen girls and shut-ins.

326
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:20,827
It's the rest of you
that need to step your game up.

327
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:22,412
Especially you two!

328
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:23,789
What was that?

329
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,708
"Cops think
pranksters blew up some pumpkins."

330
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:28,877
That is not getting eyes on the box.

331
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:35,467
But, "Police rule out witchcraft
in mysterious pumpkin cult massacre"?

332
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,094

335
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,475
I mean, look what Dave did last month.

336
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,186
Dave forgot to bring us back
from commercial for 12 minutes,

337
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,396
and nobody noticed.

338
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:51,233
Wrong. Dave got people talking about us.

339
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,569
Is that the summit
of our ambition, really?

340
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:56,446
Okay. You think you can do better?

341
00:19:56,989 --> 00:20:01,076
Tomorrow, Bruins' playing Golden Knights,
Cold War classic at TD Garden.

342
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,203
Dave, you're my guy,
so you're covering the game.

343
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:05,956
And I want the two of you on the tailgate.

344
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,584
So tell me, how are you gonna
get people talking about us?

345
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:11,170
Actually, I was thinking,
instead of covering the tailgate,

346
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,337
we could do a segment

347
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:15,048
on the team donating coats
to the city's homeless youth.

348
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:17,676
I'm sorry, what's your name?
I don't care. You are boring.

on his hair are huge.

352
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:29,688
And his face and his smile. (GIGGLES)

353

a pat on the back.

Oh, I am. Totally committed.

357
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:45,370
What if we shoot B-roll
of everyone cooking in the parking lot,

358
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:48,582
and we do a whole "Is there salmonella
at the tailgate" kinda thing?

-Go on.
-Uh, or, uh, face paint.

Uh, on fans' faces.

361
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:56,632
"Is it poisoning fans? Find out at 11:00."

362
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:59,635
-Face paint isn't poisonous.
-Yeah. And we'll tell them that at 11:00.

363
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:02,971
Good. That doesn't totally suck.

364

All right, people, I just want you
to focus on what's important. Okay?

365
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:08,477
And that's fourth place. All right?

for the 7:00 p.m. show.

(SIGHS)

527
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:19,468
I bet when Beyoncé was young,

528
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:22,221
her mother used to encourage her
in exactly the same way.

529
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,854
Did Beyoncé hyperventilate so badly
in her eighth-grade talent show

530
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:32,981
that she passed out and cracked a rib?

531
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:34,525
In seventh grade, it was hives.

532
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:37,027
She scratched those scabs
so badly they got infected,

533
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,238
I had to take her
to the hospital at 2:00 a.m.

534
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:41,865
She had a fever of 103.
Doctor said she could have got sepsis.

535
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:44,076
If you ever get sick of your job
as a TV producer,

536
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,994
you could become a motivational speaker.

537
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:48,497
Sixth grade, she projectile vomited
before she got onstage.

538
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,291
Every time she goes to perform,
it's a complete disaster.

539
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:53,168
She ends up totally crushed.

540
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:54,378
You sound like Mom.

541
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:56,046
Well, Mom has common sense.

542
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,423
Mom didn't raise Beyoncé.

-Not anymore.

What? What do you mean?

548
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,752
Step three says
that you find your true love

549
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:37,462
and you live happily ever after.

550
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:39,965
Well, we did live happily.

551
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:43,677
(SIGHS) But life
isn't always a fairy tale.

552

Sometimes people grow
or change or get divorced

553
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:50,100
or fall out of love
or run off and join a cult

554
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:52,811
or fall in love
with a skinny Pilates instructor.

555
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:55,772
Life isn't as simple
as "happily ever after."

find your heart's desire.

My heart's desire now
would be a clean house

before I started stress plucking.

01:15:24,024 --> 01:15:25,776
-That's not true.
-It is.

1394
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:28,487
You came here and did exactly
what you promised you wouldn't do.

1395
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:31,114
And the worst part is,
you didn't even need to.

1396
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:34,868
I was actually having fun tonight.
I felt pretty.

1397
01:15:34,952 --> 01:15:36,495
But why isn't that enough for you?

1398
01:15:36,995 --> 01:15:41,166
Why am I a failure
unless I'm dressed like ginger Elvis?

1399
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:44,628
-You're not a failure.
-Then why are you here?

1400
01:15:44,711 --> 01:15:48,549
Because I don't wanna fail!
They're closing down the Motherland.

1401
01:15:49,007 --> 01:15:51,885
So, you're my only chance
at being a Fairy Godmother.

1402
01:15:52,636 --> 01:15:55,556
And if I don't get you
to "happily ever after,"

1403
01:15:55,639 --> 01:15:59,852
then I'll have to spend
the rest of my life as a Tooth Fairy.

1404
01:15:59,935 --> 01:16:04,398
-(SCOFFS) This is all about you.
-No! Of course not. I...

1405
01:16:05,649 --> 01:16:07,150
Wait. Is it?

1406
01:16:07,568 --> 01:16:11,321
All this time, I thought you cared
about wanting to make me happy.

1407
01:16:11,405 --> 01:16:12,823
You just want it for you.

1408
01:16:12,906 --> 01:16:15,409
You don't care what I want,
not if it gets in your way.

1409
01:16:16,285 --> 01:16:18,537
I'm so sorry, Mackenzie.

1410
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:21,498
I'm sorry too, Eleanor,
but you need to leave.

1411
01:16:29,715 --> 01:16:30,716
Mackenzie!

1412
01:16:32,843 --> 01:16:36,513
ELEANOR: She was right about everything.
I'm not Fairy Godmother material.

1413
01:16:36,597 --> 01:16:40,350
And "happily ever afters,"
those are just for fairy tales.

1414
01:16:40,434 --> 01:16:41,768
But you helped us.

1415
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:46,607
-MIA: Don't go.
-I'm sorry. It's over.

1416
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:48,901
-She'll calm down.
-But we need you.

1417
01:16:49,318 --> 01:16:50,402
I have to go.

1418
01:16:51,695 --> 01:16:52,905
Goodbye, girls.

1419
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:06,627
Bye, Bingo.

1420
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:09,546
Bingo?

1421
01:17:12,216 --> 01:17:13,717
Who's that pig?

1422
01:17:18,889 --> 01:17:20,349
Now we have a pig and a dog.

1423
01:17:23,393 --> 01:17:25,938
Eleanor, where are you?
(SHUDDERS)

1424
01:17:35,197 --> 01:17:38,534
Gourds? Pumpkins? Carriages?

1425
01:17:38,617 --> 01:17:40,160
Transport.

(SIGHS)

1428
01:18:04,434 --> 01:18:05,602
Hi.

1429
01:18:05,686 --> 01:18:08,230
-I need to tell you something.
-I just wanna...

1430
01:18:08,313 --> 01:18:09,314
Yes.

1431
01:18:09,523 --> 01:18:12,276
I really wanted to apologize
about last night.

1432
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:13,944
I'm just completely mortified.

1433
01:18:14,027 --> 01:18:18,448
I think I had too much punch or something,
and things got a little wild.

1434
01:18:18,532 --> 01:18:21,368
No, it's... I mean, yeah,
I was surprised, but...

1435
01:18:22,578 --> 01:18:23,787
But not in a bad way.

1436
01:18:24,454 --> 01:18:25,789
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

1437
01:18:26,915 --> 01:18:31,044
Hey! You two!
What are you doin'? Get in here!

1438
01:18:32,337 --> 01:18:34,631
(GROANING) My tum-tum.

1439
01:18:35,382 --> 01:18:39,261
I'm gonna be straight with you guys.
I hit the eggnog way too hard last night.

1440
01:18:39,344 --> 01:18:42,681
So, I'm gonna keep this quick.
Did you fake the flying saucer story?

1441
01:18:43,182 --> 01:18:45,559
-No! We would never fake a story.
-Absolutely not.

1442
01:18:45,642 --> 01:18:48,270
Really? Then how do you explain this?

1443
01:18:49,938 --> 01:18:50,939
Huh?

1444
01:18:52,191 --> 01:18:56,153
And why is flying saucer girl
at the Bruins game?

1445
01:18:56,695 --> 01:19:00,449
'Cause she's my cousin,
and she's visiting from Canada.

1446
01:19:00,532 --> 01:19:02,868
You seriously want me to believe
that you and your cousin

1447
01:19:02,951 --> 01:19:05,412
had nothing to do with the fireballs?

1448
01:19:05,913 --> 01:19:06,997
It was an accident.

1449
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,791
Ah! So was the blackout too, I suppose.

1450
01:19:10,209 --> 01:19:11,418
That's her, isn't it?

1451
01:19:12,252 --> 01:19:15,672
We had three big news stories this week,

1452
01:19:15,756 --> 01:19:19,968
and your cousin was there
for every single one of them. Yes or no?

1453
01:19:20,052 --> 01:19:21,720
Mack, what's goin' on?

1454
01:19:21,803 --> 01:19:23,347
I just... I can't.

1455
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:27,392
It's really hard to explain.
But I did not fake a story.

1456
01:19:28,519 --> 01:19:32,981
Yeah. You lack the initiative
to pull that off. I actually believe you.

1457
01:19:33,065 --> 01:19:35,567
Plus, your cousin seems crazy.
She is, right?

1458
01:19:35,651 --> 01:19:39,404
No! No, she's just a little different.

1459
01:19:39,488 --> 01:19:44,660
She's a chaos machine.
And you should be ashamed of yourself...

1460
01:19:48,872 --> 01:19:50,749
For not cutting me in sooner.

1461
01:19:50,832 --> 01:19:53,418
You're good. She is ratings gold.

1462
01:19:53,502 --> 01:19:55,838
Here's what we'll do.
We're gonna put a camera on her,

1463
01:19:55,921 --> 01:19:59,550
and we are gonna let her fly
her freak flag until we're number one.

1464
01:19:59,633 --> 01:20:02,010
-That's exploitation. No.
-But that's not news.

1465
01:20:02,094 --> 01:20:04,304
I know. It's gonna be awesome.

1466
01:20:06,723 --> 01:20:07,766
No!

1467
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:10,894
I won't let you
take somebody kind and good

1468
01:20:10,978 --> 01:20:12,646
and turn them into a sideshow.

1469
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:16,316
You're a single mom, and you haven't put
a good story out in I don't know how long,

1470
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:19,069
so "no" isn't really an option for you.

1471
01:20:19,152 --> 01:20:21,613
You do what I say, or you're fired.

1472
01:20:25,284 --> 01:20:28,328
-I am done doing things your way.
-Mack, I'm not sure you...

1473
01:20:28,412 --> 01:20:30,330
You're the reason we're in last place.

1474
01:20:30,414 --> 01:20:32,416
Ah! Fourth place.

1475
01:20:32,499 --> 01:20:34,751
You want us to spin things
and twist things

1476
01:20:34,835 --> 01:20:37,546
and tell stories about bad people
doing bad things,

1477
01:20:37,629 --> 01:20:39,715
but people want more than fearmongering.

1478
01:20:39,798 --> 01:20:41,133
They wanna...

1479
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:45,762
To laugh, and to hope, and be inspired
to see the magic in the world.

1480
01:20:45,846 --> 01:20:47,973
-'Cause it's real.
-That's cute.

1481
01:20:48,599 --> 01:20:49,683
You're fired.

1482
01:20:49,766 --> 01:20:51,268
Yeah. No kidding.

1483
01:20:52,561 --> 01:20:54,688
You deserve so much better
than this place.

1484
01:20:54,771 --> 01:20:57,065
I know. That's what I was tryin'
to tell you before.

1485
01:20:57,149 --> 01:20:59,109
I took the job at Channel 4, so...

1486
01:20:59,776 --> 01:21:02,154
(INHALES) Merry Christmas. I quit.

1487
01:21:03,864 --> 01:21:05,199
How's that for spectacle?

1488
01:21:16,502 --> 01:21:18,504
-Bye.

Uh...

1500
01:22:20,274 --> 01:22:24,403
Mr. Clancy called. Honey, you're supposed
to be on stage for the rehearsal.

1501
01:22:30,951 --> 01:22:32,452
Is that Dad's guitar?

1502

(CRYING) You were right. You were right.

1503
01:22:40,169 --> 01:22:43,088
I can't do this. I can't do anything.

1504
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:45,215
Oh, I never said that.

1505
01:22:45,299 --> 01:22:47,593
Yeah, well, you never said that I could.

1506
01:22:49,303 --> 01:22:52,472
Or that you thought that I'd be amazing.

1507
01:22:54,224 --> 01:22:57,019
But Eleanor did.

1508
01:22:59,062 --> 01:23:04,318
And now she's gone.
And I can't do this. I can't...

1509
01:23:11,742 --> 01:23:13,493
I'm so sorry.

Honey, if you need Eleanor,
I'll find her. I promise.

1511
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:28,926
Should we bring Dad's guitar with us
for good luck?

understand human. But look!

been looking for Eleanor.

is the fastest way back to the Motherland?

1522
01:24:32,114 --> 01:24:33,198
Yes, but...

-I'm never going to get it.
-No worries.

That was our last pumpkin.

1525
01:24:40,789 --> 01:24:42,082
I've got an idea.

1526
01:24:46,753 --> 01:24:47,754
Ta-da!

1527
01:24:48,088 --> 01:24:49,506
That's not a pumpkin.

1528
01:24:51,341 --> 01:24:53,760
-No. I know it's not a pumpkin.
-Good.

1529
01:24:53,844 --> 01:24:57,264
-Okay. You know what? Loosen up, right?
-All right.

1530
01:24:57,347 --> 01:25:00,559
You know, just really stay loose
and don't think about the fact

1531
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:02,436
that that's a watermelon,
not a pumpkin,

1532
01:25:02,519 --> 01:25:05,147
and you might not have
enough magic left to get home,

1533
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:06,773
and you might be stuck here forever.

1534
01:25:08,442 --> 01:25:10,777
I'm sorry, that wasn't
a very good pep talk.
