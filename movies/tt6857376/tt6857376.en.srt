3
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:19,264
Good Lord, look at you.
Well, get on in here.

4
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,311
How you been, Grandma?

5
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,647
Well, I'm living.

6
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,316
I thought you were coming in earlier.

7
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,610
Well, bus was late.

8
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:36,490
I would've picked you up in town,
only they won't let me drive no more.

9
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,118
I straightened up your room.

10
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,871
Put some things in the closet.

11
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,582
You go on. Go get settled.

12
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,792
Okay.

13
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,182
Yeah.

14
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,944
Yeah, you got this lookin' good, huh?

15
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,322
Son of a bitch. Goddamn it.

16
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,491
- Hey, Shelly. Shell, Shell, Shell.
- Yeah?

17
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:21,910
You take my fucking wallet again?

18
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:26,248
Yeah, I stole it.
There was so much money in it.

19
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,336
I'll be back in, I don't know,
a couple days.

20
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,880
Can't wait.

21
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,593
That woman is nothing but trouble.

22
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:41,972
If it wasn't for her little boy,
I'd kick her right out of that trailer.

23
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,434
I imagine it's gonna take
some time getting used to.

24
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:46,935
Yeah.

25
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:50,147
You just gotta get yourself
back out there.

26
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,481
That's all.

27
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,026
You can't be feeling sorry for yourself.

28
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:55,569
No, ma'am.

29
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,781
And I go to church every Sunday.

30
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,451
If you're living here, you will too.

31
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,469
You know the conditions
of your parole, right?

32
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:21,637
Yes, sir.

33
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,055
You'll submit to drug testing.

34
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,973
You'll come in every two weeks,
right here.

35
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:30,020
You are to obey all laws:
Municipal, parish, state, federal.

36
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,355
And you'll get a job.

37
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,482
Sound good?

38
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,319
Any idea where you gonna work?

39
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,780
No. See what's out there.

40
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,157
Then I'll see you in a couple weeks.

41
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:47,955
I'll tell you what.

42
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,832
I'll give you a call if something
opens up, try to help you out.

43
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,001
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

44
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,448
- Palmer?
- When the fuck did you get out, man?

45
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,034
Holy shit!

46
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,316
Thought you weren't getting out
for five more years, man.

47
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,539
- I didn't know you could grow a beard.
- All right.

48
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,499
Hey, you should've told me
you was coming home.

49
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,293
I'd have throwed you a goddamn party.

50
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,628
- Oh, yeah? Who'd have shown up?
- Dumbass Ned.

51
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,463
- Of course I would've.
- See?

52
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,132
The last time I talked to you,

53
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,968
I threw that money at your commissary
like you was asking,

54
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,637
- but, you know, I never heard from you.
- Thank you, man.

55
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,081
You still on that second marriage?

56
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,765
Hey, don't even get me started.

57
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,768
I don't know what I was thinking.
And now I got a eight-year-old,

58
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,438
and Darleen's still kicking me in the nuts
every chance she gets.

59
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,774
- How's little Jake doing?
- Little Jake is 15 years old, man.

60
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,359
- Fifteen?
- Fifteen.

61
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,528
- Jesus.
- Yep. He's a hell of a ballplayer too.

62
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:02,613
- Yeah, man.
- Is he now?

63
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,281
- Just like his daddy.
- I'll bet.

64
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,326
Hey, you know, your TD record
only just got broke a couple years ago.

65
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,036
- No shit?
- Some little freshman kid.

66
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,705
- Freshman?
- Holy cow.

67
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,958
Look who it is. Palmer.

68
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,794
- When'd you get out?
- A few days ago.

69
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,463
Wow.

70
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,631
Looks good on you.

71
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,634
Oh, yeah. Well, you know my daddy.
It's not like I had a choice.

72
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,094
It's good to see you.

73
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,304
Yeah, you too.

74
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,641
- You staying down there at Vivian's place?
- Yeah, for now.

75
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,101
If you need anything,
you let me know, all right?

76
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:34,978
I mean that. Anything.

77
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:38,607
Shit. I need your old man to quit writing
me all these goddamn speeding tickets.

78
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,138
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Let's play some pool.

79
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,098
Hey, Ned, let's get a game in
before the wife calls.

80
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,071
Palmer, you're next.

81
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:46,907
There you go.

82
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:48,951
Appreciate you.

83
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:53,789
- Cosimo, how's it hanging?
- And what do you want?

84
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,750
I want my nails done and my ass waxed.

85
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,377
What do you think I want?

86
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,422
Get me a Jim and Coke.

87
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,061
You're Vivian's grandson, ain't you?

88
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,859
What's the matter, handsome?

89
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,529
You don't talk?

90
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,543
You really did just get outta prison.

91
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,199
Eddie. Eddie, wake up.

92
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,284
We're gonna be late for church.

93
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:02,167
This boy's gonna make us late, I swear.

94
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,386
Church starts at 10:00 a.m.
Now don't go making us late.

95
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,595
Sorry.

96
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:35,075
Sam, this is my grandson, Eddie.

97
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:40,747
Now, he would prefer you call him Palmer,
even though Eddie's a much nicer name.

98
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,128
You had a sleepover with my mama,

99
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,631
and you didn't wear no pajamas
or underwear neither.

100
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:50,716
Sam.

101
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,385
Roll that window up.

102
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,346
It took me two hours to do my hair.

103
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,238
Dot, you remember Eddie?

104
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,866
Eddie, this is Dot.

105
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,951
My grandson.

106
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,040
- Stop.
- Toby, get off him.

107
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,250
Good morning, everybody.
I'd like to welcome you

108
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:26,668
to Wesley Chapel this morning.

109
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,964
Must be strange being back here, huh?

110
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,633
You ain't kidding.

111
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:37,179
Well, not much has changed.
Still all about church and football.

112
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:40,557
- Amen.
- They did open a new coffee shop though.

113
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,228
- Eddie.
- Chief.

114
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,105
- Heard you got out early.
- Yes, sir.

115
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:50,692
Well, you make sure
to keep yourself in check.

116
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:52,986
I would hate
to have to put you back inside.

117
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:55,739
Yes, sir.

118
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,160
- See you down at the station.
- Yeah, Dad.

119
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,162
Shit. Sorry about that.

120
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:03,413
Same old fart.

121
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,791
Yeah, I'd be surprised
if he hadn't come over.

122
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,128
Look, I just wanted to say
that I should've came and visited you

123
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,130
or sent you a letter at least.

124
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,258
I should've been a better friend.

125
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,093
Forget it.

126
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,095
- What's going on?
- Hey.

127
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,638
Same shit, different Sunday.

128
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:23,684
Christ. There's something
seriously wrong with that kid.

129
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:37,573
Here now. Give this to your mother.

130
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,368
Make sure she eats some.
And it'll keep for a week.

131
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,288
- Thanks, Miss Vivian.
- Sweet boy.

132
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,998
- Bye, Miss Vivian.
- Bye-bye.

133
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:47,833
Bye, Palmer.

134
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,259
Good night, Grandma.

135
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,804
Sweet dreams, Eddie. I'm glad you're back.

136
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:03,599
Me too.

137
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:34,046
- You slept late.
- Yeah. Guess I did.

138
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,715
I need some things from the market

139
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,593
if you don't mind picking them up
on the way home.

140
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:41,803
Yeah, sure.

141
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,765
And hold on. Let me give you some money.

142
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:48,060
I don't imagine you have any.

143
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:50,771
Yeah.

144
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,981
Be careful out there.

145
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,900
I'll be back later.

146
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:57,444
Hey, I ain't kidding. You need to shave,

147
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,809
'cause you give me rug burn down here
and it really hurts.

148
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,771
I'll shave for you, 'cause God knows
I love you, and I love your strawberry.

149
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:06,119
- Who's that guy over there?
- Tell me again how much you love me.

150
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,081
Whatever.

151
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:11,917
He's just looking.

152
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:18,590
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Have a nice day.

153
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:21,051
- Hello.
- Hello.

154
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:27,057
Would you like an application?

155
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,225
Yeah, sure.

156
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:32,312
I filled that position this morning.

157
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:34,773
- Hey, Eddie. How you been?
- Hogan.

158
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,859
Just forgot to take the sign down is all.

159
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,319
Good to see you.

160
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,029
You too.

161
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:47,286
I'm sorry.
I thought that they were still hiring.

162
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,455
It's fine.

163
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:52,374
What side do you want?

164
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:53,959
This side.

165
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:57,171
I think I can spice that up a little.

166
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,338
That's good.

167
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,845
His mama took off again.

168
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,264
He'll be staying with us till she's back.

169
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,394
I think I need a little color.

170
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,105
On the way.

171
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:17,941
Thank you.

172
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:23,238
You're gonna have to sleep
out here on the couch.

173
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:25,324
Sam gets your bed at night.

174
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:29,286
I don't mind the couch, Miss Vivian.
I sleep on it at home.

175
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,873
A boy your age needs to sleep on a bed.

176
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:33,957
I don't mind.

177
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,167
I can watch TV.

178
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,171
Now, too much TV ain't good for you.

179
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,883
Excuse me. Just want these.

180
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,471
My friend Emily gave me this.

181
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:52,392
Every time she gets a new doll,
I get one of her old ones.

182
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,269
Fuck.

183
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,232
Her dog chewed this one up,
but it's still okay.

184
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,526
She just has to hop a little. See?

185
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:03,654
You know you're a boy, right?

186
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:06,073
Yeah.

187
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,450
Boys don't play with dolls.

188
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,037
Well, I'm a boy, and I do.

189
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,539
Dinner's ready!

190
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,083
See you later, Palmer.

191
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,504
- Meatballs.
- Thank you.

192
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,968
Did you have any luck finding a job?

193
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,136
Not yet.

194
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,181
- I'm sure you will.
- Miss Vivian.

195
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:38,146
- That's for her.
- We love our meatballs.

196
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:44,027
One for you, and one for me.

197
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:49,032
How long does your mama
usually stay gone for?

198
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:50,868
You hush now.

199
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,788
When you gonna give me
the rest of the change from the mart?

200
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:59,334
- I gave it to you.
- Nah, I was short.

201
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,170
What you mean "short"?

202
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,672
I didn't get all my change.

203
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:10,512
- Count it.
- I don't need to count it.

204
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:11,638
It was short.

205
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:15,017
Twelve dollars and 13 cents.
Go ahead. Count it.

206
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:18,478
You eat your supper.

207
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:55,516
Door's open.

208
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:03,106
I'm Eddie Palmer.
I'm here for my interview.

209
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:04,983
Come on in.

210
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,736
Calvin Sibs. Have a seat.

211
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:14,242
Fill this out, and we'll take
a walk over to see Principal Forbes.

212
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:20,207
Mr. Palmer, I'm sorry, but I can't
hire you simply due to the fact that

213
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,291
you're a convicted felon.

214
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,671
I understand, sir.

215
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:29,049
But I did my time, and I did it
without getting in any trouble.

216
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:30,968
Well, that may be the case,

217
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,720
but I have the safety of the children
I have to consider.

218
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:36,640
I ain't never done nothing to no kids.

219
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,310
If I can't get a job sweeping floors,

220
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:43,063
then y'all tell me,
what am I supposed to do?

221
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:46,149
Mr. Sibs, your thoughts?

222
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:52,447
He's got the experience:
Twelve years of laundry, kitchen and yard.

223
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:54,992
But it's your call.

224
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,209
You were All-USA player
two years in a row at Riverside?

225
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,794
Yes, sir.

226
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:07,754
Football scholarship to LSU?

227
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,091
Palmer.

228
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,260
You related to Vivian Palmer?

229
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,220
Yes, sir. That's my grandmother.

230
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:19,558
Well, she's a respectable member
of our congregation.

231
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:22,269
Yes, sir. I attended with her last Sunday.

232
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,771
Beautiful sermon.

233
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,609
All right, I tell you what.

234
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:32,154
I'm a big fan of second chances.

235
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:35,032
So, let me run all this
by the school board,

236
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,772
and let me see if I can pull some strings
and make something happen.

237
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,203
Thank you. Thank you.

238
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,454
You're welcome.

239
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,581
We thank you for this meal

240
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:45,667
and for allowing the three of us
to be here together.

241
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,211
- Amen.
- Amen.

242
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,337
Amen.

243
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:54,009
Miss Vivian,
you never said you were sorry...

244
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:58,597
for yesterday when you said
he shorted you, but he didn't.

245
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:02,351
Sam, drink your milk.

246
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:07,981
I miscounted.

247
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,192
I apologize.

248
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:11,735
It's okay.

249
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:16,156
Want me to get it?

250
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:20,536
- No greens, no TV.
- Hello.

251
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,371
- Yes, it is.
- Yes, ma'am.

252
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:23,539
Yes, sir.

253
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:28,168
Thank you. Okay. See you then.

254
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:35,384
Got a job.

255
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:39,847
Good for you, Palmer.

256
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:42,391
- Oh, good.
- Cheers.

257
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:46,812
Now, bathrooms and classrooms
get done every day.

258
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:51,900
We're the first that unlock the doors.
Kids get here soon after.

259
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:54,820
Make sure you get here on time.
You need to wear this.

260
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:56,238
Okay.

261
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:58,532
Should I get a set of keys?

262
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,742
Let's see how it goes first.

263
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,550
When you finish this, the air conditioner
in Maggie Hayes's room is busted.

264
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,343
- I need you to fix it.
- Yes, sir.

265
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:19,720
Gonna need these.

266
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,682
Good job, Kayleigh.

267
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,518
- I like those details.
- Snowflakes.

268
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:29,521
I love that. Is that a house or a church?

269
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:33,358
Stacy, I told you, put that away.

270
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:38,363
Ma'am, air conditioner.

271
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:40,949
Oh, yes. It's this one. Thank God.

272
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:44,203
Palmer.

273
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:49,082
- That's Palmer.
- "That's Palmer."

274
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,793
Great. So, hopefully you can fix this.

275
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:53,462
It's been making a crazy noise.

276
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:55,660
It's been really hot,
and we haven't been able to use it.

277
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:56,840
Stop, Toby!

278
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:59,343
- Toby?
- I didn't do nothing.

279
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,304
How would you feel
if someone did that to your painting?

280
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,973
Go and get a paper towel
and help clean that up.

281
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,267
All right, everybody, keep going.

282
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:22,866
Four o'clock.

283
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,827
I know. I know.
Hey, Palmer, you met my wife yet, Lucille?

284
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,579
- I haven't.
- It's nice to meet you.

285
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:28,735
- You too.
- Heard a lot about you.

286
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,487
You two have known each other
since you were little, huh?

287
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,739
Yeah. Since we were five.
He was a little skinnier back then.

288
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:33,836
Hey, we're working on that.

289
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,959
Emily, come on.
Get your butt in this car. Let's go.

290
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,590
It's just shameful
the way his mama carries on.

291
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:41,635
I can't believe the state
hasn't taken him away already.

292
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:45,264
He ain't no trouble, Dot. Now, shush.

293
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,599
I'm telling you, you can't keep that boy.

294
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:54,022
Some people just have too much to say.

295
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:55,691
Who has too much to say?

296
00:21:56,149 --> 00:22:00,320
Stop listening
to our adult conversations, Sam.

297
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:04,116
But, Miss Vivian, I'm right here.

298
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:06,493
Don't mean you have to listen.

299
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:12,624
Dot's always sticking her nose
in other people's business.

300
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,209
Whose business?

301
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:16,461
I told you, stop listening, Sam.

302
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:20,424
I can't stop listening, Miss Vivian,
if you keep talking.

303
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:22,176
Jeez Louise!

304
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:26,096
Hi, I'm Penelope.

305
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,391
This is my world in the sky,
and these are my friends.

306
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:31,226
Welcome to the club.

307
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,061
Get your wands ready.

308
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:35,606
We fly together every day.

309
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:38,066
Making friends along the way.

310
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,402
Dot is cool and Phoebe's nice.

311
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,779
And I'm the one with sparkly tights.

312
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:45,115
Miss Vivian is still sleeping.

313
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,745
Doesn't matter what people say.

314
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:52,331
Through the clouds we make our way.

315
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:54,499
Spread your wings.

316
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:57,461
In Penelope's Flying Princess Club.

317
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:17,856
We're here to celebrate Vivian Palmer,

318
00:23:18,524 --> 00:23:21,318
who we all hold deep in our hearts.

319
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:27,366
In our celebration of remembering
her joy, laughter...

320
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:30,035
and a life well lived,

321
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:35,666
we will mourn Vivian
till we are once again reunited with her

322
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:37,167
in the kingdom of heaven.

323
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:43,590
Vivian was a fine woman.

324
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:49,263
You take as much time
as you need, Palmer, all right?

325
00:25:25,651 --> 00:25:26,818
Where are we going?

326
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:33,408
- Why'd I have to pack my bag?
- Don't worry about it.

327
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,546
Come on. Get out.

328
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,391
Come on.

329
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,362
How long has she been gone this time?

330
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:11,655
About two weeks now.

331
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,700
And Vivian had him this whole time?

332
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:19,037
Of course she did. I swear, this woman...

333
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:29,673
I ain't here right now,
so leave a message.

334
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,258
Or don't. I don't give a shit.

335
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:37,097
Well, I can't take him home.

336
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:39,600
I mean, Emily alone is a handful.

337
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:44,354
And you sure you can't hang on to him
for a little bit longer? You got the room.

338
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:45,522
He ain't my problem.

339
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:49,234
All right. Leave him.

340
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:56,491
I'll put in a call to child services.

341
00:26:59,328 --> 00:27:01,580
He's gonna have to go in the system.

342
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,006
Palmer.

343
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:12,299
Where are you going?

344
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:56,218
Fuck.

345
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:26,475
Palmer.

346
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,367
Miss Maggie gave me a ride home.

347
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:46,078
- Hello.
- Come on in.

348
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:48,622
Yeah, I just thought I'd say hello.

349
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:50,415
Can I get you something to drink?

350
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,669
Water would be great. Thanks.

351
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:54,753
Right, sure.

352
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:59,925
I don't care what we do
as long as we do it together.

353
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,971
- Last one to the moon is a beautiful egg.
- Beautiful?

354
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:07,766
Miss Maggie, all the flying princesses
are flying to the moon.

355
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,935
Can you imagine? The moon.

356
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:11,520
That's amazing.

357
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:13,021
I love this!

358
00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:15,274
Hold on. Slow down.

359
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:16,900
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

360
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:17,985
No problem.

361
00:30:19,236 --> 00:30:21,780
Flying to the moon is my favorite.

362
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:24,741
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about Vivian.

363
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:28,662
I didn't know her well,
but she seemed like a really good person.

364
00:30:29,246 --> 00:30:30,664
She was a good woman.

365
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:34,084
She actually was watching Sam
quite a bit lately.

366
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:37,045
You wouldn't know where Shelly is,
would you?

367
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,756
Your guess is as good as mine.

368
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,383
One, two, three.

369
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:43,218
Princess power. Princess power...

370
00:30:43,302 --> 00:30:44,887
So, how's it going?

371
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:49,975
Good. Yeah, fine.

372
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:53,145
She's never really gone for too long.

373
00:30:53,896 --> 00:30:55,189
How about this?

374
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:57,357
You know, I just give you my phone number,

375
00:30:57,441 --> 00:31:01,111
and if you have any questions,
or if you need anything,

376
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:03,572
or if it's too much,
you just give me a call.

377
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:06,074
Yeah, sure. That'd be helpful.

378
00:31:06,158 --> 00:31:07,367
Do you have a cell phone?

379
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:10,329
No. Well, there's... one on the wall.

380
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:12,706
- May I?
- Yeah, sure.

381
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:13,957
Old-school.

382
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,668
I asked Sam if he wanted to stay with me,

383
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:19,213
but he said he wanted
to stay here with you.

384
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,380
Sparkles!

385
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:22,216
This is good of you.

386
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:25,427
You know, most people would've left him.

387
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:28,514
Well, what was I supposed to do?

388
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:30,641
Oh, my goodness. Is that a dragon?

389
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:32,976
- Bye, Sam.
- Bye, Miss Maggie.

390
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,020
Okay, thanks.

391
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:38,273
I ain't here right now,
so leave a message.

392
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:39,733
Or don't. I don't give a shit.

393
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:53,038
What you playing?

394
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:55,165
Solitaire.

395
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:57,459
Can I play?

396
00:31:58,043 --> 00:31:59,795
Nope, it's for one player.

397
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:09,346
Is this a boy or a girl?

398
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:13,392
Did you wash today?

399
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:16,103
Yeah, I washed earlier.

400
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,650
You stink.

401
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:25,320
Palmer!

402
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:35,831
I just wanted to make sure
you were still here.

403
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:38,417
- I'm watching TV.
- Okay.

404
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:42,212
Palmer!

405
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:45,215
Jesus Christ.

406
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:47,092
What?

407
00:32:47,593 --> 00:32:50,095
You're not going anywhere, are you?

408
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:52,556
No. I'm right here.

409
00:32:55,184 --> 00:32:56,393
Y'all ready to get out?

410
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,521
I'm ready to get out!

411
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:04,193
What's that?

412
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:05,819
I'm ready to get out.

413
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:08,906
Just get out. Here.

414
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:11,909
It's cold.

415
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,954
At DuBois and Guidry,
we've been working to get you your money...

416
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:17,623
All right.

417
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:19,249
Go to sleep.

418
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:21,752
Palmer.

419
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:25,589
Yeah?

420
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:29,134
Do you know when my mama's coming back?

421
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:31,803
Nah, I wish I did.

422
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:37,601
I sometimes get mad
at my mama for leaving.

423
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:39,978
Do you ever get mad at yours?

424
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:44,191
I barely knew the woman.

425
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,860
But you knew your daddy.

426
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:48,278
That's right.

427
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,739
Do you miss him?

428
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:52,950
Yeah.

429
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:55,035
Yeah, sometimes I do.

430
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,037
Miss Vivian missed him too.

431
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:00,457
But now, she gets to see him.

432
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:06,505
I'm sure she does.

433
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:09,174
Go to sleep, Sam.

434
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:12,344
Palmer? Good night.

435
00:34:14,638 --> 00:34:15,639
Good night.

436
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:44,311
Hey. Get in.

437
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:56,073
Hey, Palmer.

438
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:03,747
My mama bought me this.

439
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:07,626
She got it at a garage sale.

440
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:12,381
She said it was a bargain
'cause she got it for 50 cents.

441
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,634
And she said
there was this woman named Heifer,

442
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:19,763
'cause that old heifer
tried to steal it out from my mama.

443
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:21,390
But my mama wouldn't let her,

444
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:26,436
'cause she knew princesses
were my favorite thing in the whole world.

445
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:41,326
All right. You guys are doing a great job.

446
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,453
Tell me, what else do you see
in the ocean?

447
00:36:43,537 --> 00:36:44,705
Jellyfish?

448
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:46,874
Jellyfish. And what do we see, Thomas?

449
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:03,182
- Palmer?
- All right.

450
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:04,474
Really?

451
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:07,603
Okay. Hold on. Stay right here.

452
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:08,896
Hey, Eddie.

453
00:37:08,979 --> 00:37:10,606
- Hey, it's Lucille.
- Hey.

454
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:13,400
- Yeah, we met at church with Tommy.
- Yeah, right. Right.

455
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:15,694
Yeah, Tommy mentioned
you're working at the school.

456
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:17,654
So...

457
00:37:18,655 --> 00:37:20,073
Emily just adores Sam,

458
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:23,076
and so I was wondering if it'd be okay
for them to have a playdate.

459
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,038
Sam said I had to ask you.
He said you were his daddy.

460
00:37:26,747 --> 00:37:27,789
Playdate?

461
00:37:27,873 --> 00:37:31,668
Yeah, they would come right now
over to our house so that they could play.

462
00:37:31,752 --> 00:37:32,878
It's called a playdate.

463
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:38,091
And then you could just pick him up,
say, around 5:00.

464
00:37:39,218 --> 00:37:40,677
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah?

465
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:41,803
Hey, guys.

466
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,182
- Told you.
- Let's do it.

467
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:03,492
Look. He's early.

468
00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:06,078
Come in. Come on in.

469
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:08,372
- Oh, Christ.
- What are you doing?

470
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:09,665
Come on.

471
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:13,669
I don't know. He's just sitting there.

472
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:16,255
I'm not gonna bite. You can come in.

473
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:17,923
- In...
- Yeah.

474
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:22,344
I don't know what he's doing.

475
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:24,555
To hell with it.

476
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:26,515
Shit.

477
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,809
Can I get you anything?

478
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:30,507
- No, no, no. Yeah.
- You want anything? Okay.

479
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:32,145
- Can I get your coat?
- No, I'm good.

480
00:38:32,229 --> 00:38:33,939
- Hey, Palmer.
- Hey, Sam.

481
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:35,816
Is Coles still at work?

482
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:38,151
Yeah. That's what he tells me.

483
00:38:39,361 --> 00:38:42,114
And look. It is teatime, see?

484
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:44,116
Just make yourself comfortable right here.

485
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:46,451
Actually, just... You wanna sit...
This looks good.

486
00:38:46,535 --> 00:38:47,744
How many lumps do you want?

487
00:38:49,288 --> 00:38:51,456
She means sugar. Sugar.

488
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,541
Two.

489
00:38:56,295 --> 00:38:58,088
Careful, Palmer. It's hot.

490
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:01,717
- Sir. This is beautiful.
- Thanks.

491
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:05,888
Pinkies, please.

492
00:39:05,971 --> 00:39:07,222
Pinkies up.

493
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:12,644
Do you know they drink tea in England?

494
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:13,729
Yes.

495
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:17,065
It's so good.
What do you think, Mr. Palmer?

496
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:20,736
Yes.

497
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:21,945
Real good.

498
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:24,990
I love it.
I think I'll have a little more.

499
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:26,700
- Bye, Miss Lucille.
- Bye, Sam.

500
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:28,202
- Take care.
- Bye.

501
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:29,995
Tea parties are my favorite.

502
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:33,540
So, is Emily your girlfriend?

503
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:37,377
She says she wants to marry me
when we get older.

504
00:39:37,461 --> 00:39:39,213
That sounds like a good offer.

505
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:42,132
- I'm not gonna marry her.
- You never know. Maybe you will.

506
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:45,427
Nah. She's a bossy little thing.

507
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,513
You don't say.

508
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:49,806
Okay. Yeah, all right, Daryl.

509
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,518
Yeah, I'll be there.
I can't wait to see him play.

510
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:54,436
Jesus.

511
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:57,773
Hey, you ever been to a football game?

512
00:39:57,856 --> 00:39:59,107
Football?

513
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:14,426
See that guy right out there?
Number three.

514
00:40:14,456 --> 00:40:16,708
That's the quarterback.
That's what I used to play.

515
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:19,711
- Cool. Did you have a number?
- I sure did, number nine.

516
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:21,171
- Well, look who it is.
- Hey.

517
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:22,965
- Hi, Mr. Coles.
- Hey, Sammy.

518
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:25,384
Heard y'all had yourself
a little tea party the other day.

519
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:26,468
Yeah.

520
00:40:26,552 --> 00:40:29,763
Yeah, well, don't worry.
I've had to go to a few myself.

521
00:40:29,847 --> 00:40:30,848
I bet.

522
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:33,767
God dang it. Max, Morgan,
get off that fence!

523
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:35,561
Duty calls. Y'all enjoy the game.

524
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:36,728
- All right, bud.
- Hey!

525
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:37,980
- You hungry?
- Yep.

526
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:40,274
- Thanks.
- Thank you very much.

527
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:41,567
Hey, Miss Maggie.

528
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:44,528
Sam, what are you doing here?
Are you a Rebels fan now?

529
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:48,991
Yep, that's the quarterback out there.
Palmer used to be him when he played.

530
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:51,285
- Quarterback, huh?
- A long time ago.

531
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:53,036
What can I get for you?

532
00:40:53,704 --> 00:40:54,830
I already know.

533
00:40:55,414 --> 00:40:56,498
- Cookies.
- Cookies.

534
00:40:56,582 --> 00:40:57,958
Cookies!

535
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,460
- All right. It's on me, kiddo.
- Thanks.

536
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:02,379
What else you got planned for the weekend?

537
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:03,463
I don't know.

538
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:06,633
Do you wanna come with me
to a bowling fundraiser tomorrow?

539
00:41:06,717 --> 00:41:09,553
- Sure. Can Palmer come too?
- No, no, no. Miss Maggie invited you.

540
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:11,513
She don't care. Right, Miss Maggie?

541
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:14,725
- Sure, you're more than welcome to join.
- I can't. I got things to do.

542
00:41:14,808 --> 00:41:18,020
No, you don't. You're lying.
You got nothing to do.

543
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:19,730
Please, Palmer. Please.

544
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:21,511
- I think someone wants you to come.
- You have to come.

545
00:41:21,523 --> 00:41:23,942
- Okay, all right. I'll go.
- Yes.

546
00:41:24,026 --> 00:41:27,738
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Riverside High,

547
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:32,284
home of the Riverside Rebels
and the Honey Belles.

548
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:34,369
Palmer!

549
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,914
- What's up, Palmer?
- Hey, Sibs. How are ya?

550
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:37,998
All right.

551
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:40,042
Don't forget to buy your raffle tickets.

552
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:43,670
Five dollars for the raffle tickets.
Five dollars. All the proceeds...

553
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:45,410
All right, looks like we made it
just in time.

554
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:48,091
Hey there, little fella.
Can I have one of those?

555
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,511
Thank you.

556
00:41:50,594 --> 00:41:52,596
How the hell
did you get stuck babysitting?

557
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:57,309
Hey, don't get mixed up with Shelly, man.

558
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:01,813
Trust me on that. Keep your dick
as far away from that one as possible.

559
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:03,398
She'll burn it right off.

560
00:42:05,192 --> 00:42:06,652
Good to have you home, man.

561
00:42:06,735 --> 00:42:09,154
- Cookie, cookie, cookie.
- Ned, Ned.

562
00:42:09,238 --> 00:42:11,281
- Leave the boy's cookies alone.
- It's a fumble!

563
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:12,950
That's good, man.

564
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,244
Great play.

565
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:18,997
Look, see? Number ten.
That's my boy, Jake, right there.

566
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:20,082
Yeah. I see him.

567
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:22,417
How they doing this season anyway?

568
00:42:22,501 --> 00:42:24,253
Are you kidding me? They're 3-0.

569
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:26,463
Won that last game by three touchdowns.

570
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:28,882
It's the best offensive line
I've seen in years.

571
00:42:35,264 --> 00:42:36,265
Hey...

572
00:42:36,932 --> 00:42:38,851
you ever see that Wessler kid anymore?

573
00:42:39,935 --> 00:42:40,978
Why?

574
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,982
I tried looking him and his old man up.
Couldn't find either of 'em.

575
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:49,403
Man, you gotta let that shit go.

576
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:54,783
What you should have done
is beat his son's ass too.

577
00:42:54,867 --> 00:42:56,034
Nah.

578
00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:59,621
Well, he was the one bragging
about all that money his daddy got.

579
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:01,915
Mind, there wasn't even
hardly nothing in there.

580
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:05,377
And you go away for what?

581
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,671
Old man lived, right? He was fine.

582
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:10,382
He was lucky you used
an aluminum bat instead of wood.

583
00:43:10,465 --> 00:43:11,884
Otherwise, he'd be dead.

584
00:43:15,053 --> 00:43:18,265
Hey, you did your time, Palmer.
You don't owe nobody shit.

585
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:21,768
Unlike Coles.

586
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:25,314
Left you standing there
with your dick in your hand.

587
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:26,565
I ain't talking shit.

588
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:28,817
If you gonna be mad at somebody,
it should be him.

589
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:32,404
And there's the pass. Jake Reed...

590
00:43:32,487 --> 00:43:34,072
All right!

591
00:43:34,656 --> 00:43:37,910
What did I tell you?
Just like his goddamn daddy!

592
00:43:38,493 --> 00:43:40,454
Ladies and gentlemen, the Honey Belles!

593
00:43:40,537 --> 00:43:42,247
The Honey Belles.

594
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:48,921
We are Riverside!

595
00:43:49,546 --> 00:43:51,256
We are Riverside!

596
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:55,469
Now, go on. Get inside
and lock this door behind me.

597
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:56,970
Where are you going?

598
00:43:57,054 --> 00:43:58,734
Don't worry about it. It's grown-up stuff.

599
00:43:59,348 --> 00:44:01,099
Why can't I come with you?

600
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:02,476
Because I said so.

601
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:07,064
My favorite part was the Honey Belles.
My mama was a Honey Belle.

602
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:09,316
I'm sure she was.

603
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,984
Now shut the door.

604
00:44:12,945 --> 00:44:13,946
Lock it.

605
00:44:21,912 --> 00:44:23,664
No, no, her name was Bubba-Jean...

606
00:44:24,706 --> 00:44:26,458
and she was from Havana, Alabama...

607
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:29,628
- Hold on. Her name was Bubba-Jean?
- Here, kitty, kitty.

608
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:31,004
So she was gonna come over,

609
00:44:31,088 --> 00:44:33,465
I was gonna give her
some of my grandmama's moonshine.

610
00:44:33,549 --> 00:44:36,218
- Hey, Sibs.
- Hey, Jake.

611
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:37,636
- Hey!
- Hell of a catch.

612
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:38,887
Great win, boys!

613
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:41,390
Hey, Jake!

614
00:44:41,473 --> 00:44:44,893
- Tommy held the line right here. Yeah.
- Kick ass and take names, all right?

615
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:47,271
- Jake!
- We're doing what we do.

616
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:49,898
- Best game y'all ever played.
- Hey.

617
00:44:49,982 --> 00:44:52,943
Too big of a football star now
to say "hi" to your old man?

618
00:44:53,735 --> 00:44:56,029
Let's get out of here. He's drunk.

619
00:44:58,156 --> 00:45:01,201
I'm gonna go get a beer. Jake.

620
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:04,246
Hey, Palmer. Look who it is.

621
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:06,206
It's your boss man, Sibs.

622
00:45:07,332 --> 00:45:09,209
Hey, get me a beer over here!

623
00:45:09,293 --> 00:45:12,212
Hey, how's my boy Palmer
working out for you?

624
00:45:12,296 --> 00:45:13,630
He's being a good boy for you?

625
00:45:14,464 --> 00:45:16,300
He's doing just fine, Daryl.

626
00:45:17,217 --> 00:45:19,678
I'm sorry. Am I bothering you?

627
00:45:20,804 --> 00:45:22,514
I'm just trying to have a drink here...

628
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,808
in peace.

629
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:28,353
Yeah, well, if you're looking for peace,
I suggest you find another fucking bar.

630
00:45:28,437 --> 00:45:30,981
Where the hell is my beer?

631
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:34,526
- I'll go.
- All right.

632
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:37,529
Hey, Daryl. Come on. We got you a beer.

633
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:40,449
- Come on. Let's play some pool.
- All right.

634
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:42,701
- Yeah, let's play.
- Hey, let's play some pool.

635
00:45:42,784 --> 00:45:44,661
- All right.
- Coles, grab our shit.

636
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,959
Good morning. Wake up.

637
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:54,796
I can't wait to go bowling.

638
00:45:56,965 --> 00:45:59,760
- What are you doing with that?
- It's for you.

639
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:03,222
Go get dressed.

640
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:32,167
Yes!

641
00:46:42,761 --> 00:46:44,638
- Okay.
- All right!

642
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:45,722
Pretty good.

643
00:46:46,348 --> 00:46:48,267
Oh, my gosh! Good job!

644
00:46:49,685 --> 00:46:51,353
Good job, Sammy!

645
00:46:51,436 --> 00:46:53,897
I like those dance moves, man.

646
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,111
I'm done.
Can I have some money to play some games?

647
00:47:02,072 --> 00:47:03,073
Thank you.

648
00:47:04,283 --> 00:47:06,118
And we're leaving in ten minutes.

649
00:47:06,201 --> 00:47:07,202
Okay.

650
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:10,497
Did you get one of these yet?

651
00:47:10,581 --> 00:47:13,000
Nope. One on the wall still works.

652
00:47:15,544 --> 00:47:18,589
So, quarterback at Riverside.

653
00:47:20,632 --> 00:47:21,967
Yeah, the glory days.

654
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:23,886
And then I went on to LSU.

655
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:28,682
What? What is that face?

656
00:47:29,474 --> 00:47:31,560
I'm a closeted Bulldogs fan.

657
00:47:32,102 --> 00:47:33,228
You went to Georgia?

658
00:47:33,312 --> 00:47:35,147
Go, Dawgs! Sic 'em!

659
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:37,191
No, no. You can't say that around here.

660
00:47:37,274 --> 00:47:40,402
You're the first person I told,
so if you tell anyone, I will deny it.

661
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:41,778
Your secret is safe with me.

662
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:43,197
Thank you.

663
00:47:44,615 --> 00:47:47,618
I only went to LSU
for about a year, and then...

664
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:52,080
then got sort of a different education.

665
00:47:55,459 --> 00:47:57,294
Yeah, I did hear about that.

666
00:47:58,629 --> 00:47:59,838
People like to talk.

667
00:48:00,464 --> 00:48:01,590
Don't I know.

668
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:06,595
And now to be back here, it's a...

669
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:10,349
Yes! Another jackpot!

670
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:12,184
So, how'd you end up here?

671
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:17,814
I was in a different institution.

672
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:20,609
Marriage.

673
00:48:21,735 --> 00:48:24,071
Yeah, I was married and living in Atlanta.

674
00:48:24,947 --> 00:48:28,283
He and I met in college.
Tied the knot right after.

675
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:30,827
Things didn't work out.

676
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:33,539
Once the divorce was final,
I wanted to be closer to my family.

677
00:48:33,622 --> 00:48:35,262
And I got a cousin here in Sylvain, so...

678
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:37,584
I moved.

679
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:42,339
You know, sometimes, yeah,
it can be a little too...

680
00:48:43,715 --> 00:48:45,008
country.

681
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:18,458
Trash bins need to be washed out.

682
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:20,961
Take 'em round back.
There's a hose. Wipe 'em down.

683
00:49:21,503 --> 00:49:22,504
Yes, sir.

684
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:29,469
Hey, Daryl was an asshole in high school.

685
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:31,263
Not much has changed.

686
00:49:31,763 --> 00:49:34,433
Personally,
I don't spend time with assholes.

687
00:49:35,642 --> 00:49:36,643
Yes, sir.

688
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,568
Sam.

689
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:47,070
- Come talk with me for a moment.
- Okay.

690
00:49:57,456 --> 00:50:00,292
I saw that Mr. Palmer
gave you a ride to school this morning.

691
00:50:01,084 --> 00:50:03,170
- Does he always do that?
- Yes, sir.

692
00:50:03,962 --> 00:50:06,465
And he lives right next door to you.
Is that right?

693
00:50:06,548 --> 00:50:09,259
His house is right beside
my mama's trailer.

694
00:50:11,136 --> 00:50:12,638
And he's always nice to you?

695
00:50:13,222 --> 00:50:14,515
Yes, sir.

696
00:50:14,598 --> 00:50:15,974
And everything's okay?

697
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:26,068
Sam, if everything weren't okay,
you could tell me, no matter what it is.

698
00:50:29,029 --> 00:50:31,198
It's okay, son. Go on.

699
00:50:33,992 --> 00:50:37,412
Your breath smells kinda funny.

700
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:43,001
Okay. Well, carry on.

701
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:50,592
Rinse.

702
00:50:52,553 --> 00:50:54,555
Come on. Get dressed. Can't be late.

703
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:04,940
I'll see you in a couple weeks.

704
00:51:06,191 --> 00:51:07,317
Good luck to you.

705
00:51:13,156 --> 00:51:14,157
Bye.

706
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:16,577
You like root beer floats?

707
00:51:17,244 --> 00:51:19,329
I don't know. Never had one.

708
00:51:20,038 --> 00:51:22,457
What? Never had one?

709
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,334
Come on, man.

710
00:51:26,962 --> 00:51:28,213
Well?

711
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:30,883
Heaven in a cup.

712
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:37,222
Why did you have to go see
that man anyways?

713
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:43,520
'Cause I did something bad,
and he's gotta check up on me

714
00:51:43,604 --> 00:51:45,105
to make sure I'm doing good now.

715
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:46,857
Well, what'd you do?

716
00:51:49,735 --> 00:51:52,196
I wasn't a nice person.

717
00:51:52,988 --> 00:51:54,406
I hurt somebody.

718
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,493
And I stole money and a whole lot
of other things that didn't belong to me.

719
00:51:59,244 --> 00:52:03,248
My mama stole money once,
but she never had to go see that man.

720
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:08,212
Some people get caught, and some don't.
I got caught.

721
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:12,966
My mom said she had to steal
'cause we were poor.

722
00:52:13,592 --> 00:52:15,594
Lots of people are poor. They don't steal.

723
00:52:15,677 --> 00:52:16,720
You did.

724
00:52:18,555 --> 00:52:21,725
That's right, I did. And I wish I hadn't.

725
00:52:24,102 --> 00:52:25,312
I stole too.

726
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:27,272
You did, huh?

727
00:52:29,316 --> 00:52:31,527
You think that person
misses what you took?

728
00:52:32,486 --> 00:52:35,197
I know she does. She cried in class.

729
00:52:35,781 --> 00:52:39,409
Miss Maggie asked if anyone had seen it,
and I said no.

730
00:52:40,827 --> 00:52:41,954
So you lied too.

731
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:48,877
You think that little girl would feel
better if she got back what you stole?

732
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:53,423
Yeah. I think I'd feel better too.

733
00:52:53,966 --> 00:52:55,384
I bet she'd appreciate it.

734
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:06,854
I stole from Miss Vivian too,
but I can't give it back.

735
00:53:06,937 --> 00:53:08,146
You did, huh?

736
00:53:10,399 --> 00:53:11,567
I was hungry.

737
00:53:13,652 --> 00:53:14,736
It's all right.

738
00:53:16,321 --> 00:53:19,867
But I bet if you'd asked Miss Vivian
for anything in the world,

739
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:21,368
she'd have helped you out.

740
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:22,578
What do you think?

741
00:53:23,412 --> 00:53:26,206
Yeah, think she would've.

742
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:28,667
Me too.

743
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:35,424
You ain't gonna go all psycho on me
after all that sugar, are you?

744
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:39,553
All right, tucked in there.

745
00:53:40,971 --> 00:53:43,891
This is way more comfier than the couch.

746
00:53:43,974 --> 00:53:45,809
Well, that's 'cause it's a bed.

747
00:53:48,353 --> 00:53:49,354
Palmer?

748
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:52,524
Yeah?

749
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:55,861
Nothing.

750
00:53:57,446 --> 00:53:58,447
Good night, Sam.

751
00:53:59,573 --> 00:54:00,574
Night.

752
00:54:49,748 --> 00:54:52,543
You think maybe we ought to put
something else in there today?

753
00:54:53,168 --> 00:54:54,169
Okay.

754
00:54:54,253 --> 00:54:56,338
Grab that loaf of bread and a plastic bag.

755
00:55:00,133 --> 00:55:01,510
Throw it on the table.

756
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:05,180
Sit down.

757
00:55:07,432 --> 00:55:08,642
All right.

758
00:55:08,725 --> 00:55:11,228
Now, not many people know this.

759
00:55:11,979 --> 00:55:12,980
When I was your age,

760
00:55:13,063 --> 00:55:16,567
I won the state sandwich-making contest
three years in a row.

761
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:19,987
There's no state sandwich contest.

762
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:21,905
There ain't? Then how'd I win?

763
00:55:23,073 --> 00:55:26,660
Now, the secret is you gotta spread
the mustard evenly

764
00:55:26,743 --> 00:55:28,328
on both slices of bread.

765
00:55:28,412 --> 00:55:29,705
Judges love that.

766
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:31,874
You're fibbing.

767
00:55:36,837 --> 00:55:38,046
Are you calling me a liar?

768
00:55:40,591 --> 00:55:42,009
A matter of fact, I am.

769
00:55:43,927 --> 00:55:45,053
Yeah, I am.

770
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,515
Look, just do me a favor, okay?

771
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:52,769
You can have the cookies,
but will you just eat this before?

772
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:54,521
Okay.

773
00:55:55,105 --> 00:55:56,773
Attakid. Let's do it.

774
00:55:58,275 --> 00:55:59,359
Morning, Sam.

775
00:55:59,443 --> 00:56:00,736
Hey, Mr. Sibs.

776
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:02,779
Early, huh?

777
00:56:02,863 --> 00:56:04,239
Early bird gets the worm.

778
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:34,853
...dear Sam.

779
00:56:34,937 --> 00:56:38,649
Happy birthday to you.

780
00:56:38,732 --> 00:56:39,816
There you go.

781
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:42,694
One left. One left!

782
00:56:42,778 --> 00:56:44,321
Blow it.

783
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:45,405
There you go.

784
00:56:48,158 --> 00:56:49,368
I hope you like it.

785
00:56:50,786 --> 00:56:53,038
A guitar! But I don't know how to play it.

786
00:56:54,248 --> 00:56:58,210
It's actually called a ukulele,
and I'll show you how to play it.

787
00:56:58,293 --> 00:56:59,294
Here.

788
00:57:00,295 --> 00:57:01,296
There you go.

789
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,381
So here's your notes.

790
00:57:02,464 --> 00:57:05,217
G, C, E, A.

791
00:57:06,301 --> 00:57:07,636
And what you want to say is.

792
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:11,390
My dog has fleas.

793
00:57:11,473 --> 00:57:13,809
- What do you think about that?
- Cool.

794
00:57:13,892 --> 00:57:14,893
Try it.

795
00:57:15,811 --> 00:57:19,106
My dog has fleas.

796
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:20,899
- Wow!
- That's pretty good.

797
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:23,402
- Thanks.
- My dog really does have fleas.

798
00:57:24,862 --> 00:57:26,113
Good to know.

799
00:57:26,196 --> 00:57:28,365
Try it again.
See if y'all can do it together.

800
00:57:28,448 --> 00:57:30,784
My dog has fleas.

801
00:57:30,868 --> 00:57:32,870
My dog has fleas.

802
00:57:33,704 --> 00:57:34,913
My dog has fleas.

803
00:57:34,997 --> 00:57:36,957
- That was a mistake.
- Oh, yeah.

804
00:57:39,042 --> 00:57:40,043
Is this you?

805
00:57:42,004 --> 00:57:44,798
- Yeah.
- Look at how cute you were.

806
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,466
All right.

807
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:49,553
Did Vivian raise you alone?

808
00:57:51,221 --> 00:57:53,932
My dad passed away
when I was in high school.

809
00:57:54,016 --> 00:57:55,225
She took care of me.

810
00:57:55,976 --> 00:57:57,144
And your mother?

811
00:57:57,769 --> 00:57:59,563
Ran off when I was about five.

812
00:58:01,023 --> 00:58:02,816
Vivian was more like a mother to me.

813
00:58:08,614 --> 00:58:10,032
It's a lot of mail you got here.

814
00:58:11,283 --> 00:58:12,284
Yeah, I know.

815
00:58:13,452 --> 00:58:15,078
You know you gotta open it, right?

816
00:58:15,162 --> 00:58:18,081
Why? Can't be anything good in there.

817
00:58:18,165 --> 00:58:21,460
If you want,
I can help you sort through some of it.

818
00:58:21,543 --> 00:58:22,616
Nah, you don't have to do that.

819
00:58:22,628 --> 00:58:26,507
I know I don't have to.
There might be some cool coupons in there.

820
00:58:28,091 --> 00:58:29,343
Jesus.

821
00:58:29,426 --> 00:58:31,970
Hey, be careful with that.

822
00:58:34,723 --> 00:58:38,310
All right, this one is for $12.61.

823
00:58:38,393 --> 00:58:39,394
Okay.

824
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:44,149
There's 13 even,
and you can keep the change.

825
00:58:44,233 --> 00:58:45,484
Thank you.

826
00:58:47,444 --> 00:58:49,655
- Do you wanna do the lawyer next?
- Yeah. Yeah.

827
00:58:50,322 --> 00:58:51,365
All right.

828
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:54,451
What's it say?

829
00:58:57,538 --> 00:58:58,789
It's about Vivian's will.

830
00:58:58,872 --> 00:59:02,084
The lawyer just wants you to call him
as soon as you can.

831
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:03,210
That's it?

832
00:59:06,255 --> 00:59:07,422
Okay.

833
00:59:07,506 --> 00:59:11,260
This Eddie Palmer?
Were you aware of Vivian's will?

834
00:59:11,343 --> 00:59:12,594
No, I'm not.

835
00:59:13,512 --> 00:59:15,430
Well,
according to your grandmother's will,

836
00:59:15,514 --> 00:59:17,641
her house and land
are to be put up for sale,

837
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:21,311
and the money is gonna be donated
to the Saints of Christ Church.

838
00:59:21,395 --> 00:59:25,148
But she also left instructions
that you'll receive $5,000.

839
00:59:25,232 --> 00:59:26,483
Hold on. She...

840
00:59:27,442 --> 00:59:29,444
She's giving the house to the church?

841
00:59:30,529 --> 00:59:31,738
These are her wishes?

842
00:59:32,531 --> 00:59:34,157
I'm afraid so.

843
00:59:34,241 --> 00:59:36,201
Do you have any other questions?

844
00:59:37,828 --> 00:59:40,038
When do I gotta move out?

845
00:59:40,122 --> 00:59:41,915
Well, once the house sells,

846
00:59:41,999 --> 00:59:44,543
you'll have 30 days
to vacate the premises.

847
00:59:47,504 --> 00:59:51,049
'Kay, ready? Snap to the right.

848
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,260
Turn to the left.

849
00:59:53,343 --> 00:59:56,096
- Go like that. Not like...
- This?

850
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:58,307
Okay? So get like... Yeah.

851
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:01,018
Hey, Sam. Why do you act like a girl?

852
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:04,104
I... I don't know.

853
01:00:04,646 --> 01:00:06,690
I know why. 'Cause he's a faggot.

854
01:00:08,317 --> 01:00:10,152
Stop, Toby.

855
01:00:11,111 --> 01:00:14,031
He's probably going
as a fairy for Halloween.

856
01:00:17,075 --> 01:00:18,410
What you gonna do about it?

857
01:00:18,869 --> 01:00:19,870
Nothing.

858
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:24,499
Go on to class, Sam.

859
01:00:26,835 --> 01:00:28,003
Y'all get outta here.

860
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:36,303
You touch that boy again,
I'm gonna break your arm.

861
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:37,930
Got it?

862
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:39,973
Go.

863
01:00:49,775 --> 01:00:54,655
And remember, if you wanna be a member
of Penelope's Flying Princess Club,

864
01:00:54,738 --> 01:00:57,366
all you have to do is write us a letter.

865
01:00:57,449 --> 01:01:00,118
We'll even mail you a certificate.

866
01:01:00,202 --> 01:01:01,703
I love new members.

867
01:01:01,787 --> 01:01:04,748
Penelope the Princess said
if you write their show a letter,

868
01:01:04,831 --> 01:01:06,917
you can join their club.

869
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,169
They even give you a certificate.

870
01:01:09,253 --> 01:01:11,088
Okay, everybody fly back.

871
01:01:11,171 --> 01:01:12,589
Can you write me one?

872
01:01:13,257 --> 01:01:14,258
Look.

873
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:17,469
There's things in this world you can be,
and there's things that you can't.

874
01:01:17,553 --> 01:01:19,847
- ...ready for adventure.
- Okay?

875
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:22,724
How many boys do you see on that show?

876
01:01:23,809 --> 01:01:26,311
- None.
- And what does that tell you?

877
01:01:27,354 --> 01:01:29,439
- That I can be the first.
- Here goes.

878
01:01:30,607 --> 01:01:33,569
Sparkles! Hello, Sparkles.

879
01:01:33,652 --> 01:01:36,154
Gemma, Lilly, come on.

880
01:01:36,655 --> 01:01:38,657
Look! They have it.

881
01:01:39,324 --> 01:01:40,492
Can I get it?

882
01:01:41,285 --> 01:01:44,621
What about being Peter the Prince
or, I don't know, a pirate?

883
01:01:44,705 --> 01:01:47,833
I don't wanna be a pirate.
I wanna be Penelope the Princess.

884
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:50,210
You can't be a princess,
so pick something else.

885
01:01:50,294 --> 01:01:52,754
Why? Emily is going as a princess.

886
01:01:52,838 --> 01:01:55,382
- Emily is a girl.
- So?

887
01:01:57,968 --> 01:01:59,887
Come here. Look at me.

888
01:02:01,597 --> 01:02:05,642
Some costumes are made for girls,
and some are made for boys.

889
01:02:05,726 --> 01:02:09,313
Now, it don't mean you can't wear it.
You can.

890
01:02:09,396 --> 01:02:11,231
But kids are mean.

891
01:02:11,315 --> 01:02:14,818
Especially when they see something
that they ain't used to seeing.

892
01:02:14,902 --> 01:02:18,780
They just expect to see
a girl wearing this costume.

893
01:02:19,489 --> 01:02:21,366
Like your friend Emily.

894
01:02:22,284 --> 01:02:24,411
They should make one for boys.

895
01:02:24,494 --> 01:02:25,495
They do.

896
01:02:27,122 --> 01:02:28,457
It's Peter the Prince.

897
01:02:33,587 --> 01:02:35,172
You ready for Halloween?

898
01:02:35,255 --> 01:02:36,465
Yep. I can't wait.

899
01:02:36,882 --> 01:02:39,009
You have yourself a good time.

900
01:02:39,092 --> 01:02:41,553
Eddie Palmer. Hello, Sam.

901
01:02:42,095 --> 01:02:43,972
You still looking after this boy?

902
01:02:44,056 --> 01:02:46,850
You got no right looking after any child.

903
01:02:46,934 --> 01:02:48,644
You ain't nothing but a criminal.

904
01:02:48,727 --> 01:02:49,811
Come on, Sam.

905
01:02:50,479 --> 01:02:51,522
You know what?

906
01:02:51,605 --> 01:02:54,650
Palmer's been seeing that man,
and he's been doing good.

907
01:02:54,733 --> 01:02:57,152
So you can mind your own ass.

908
01:02:57,236 --> 01:02:58,403
Come on.

909
01:02:58,487 --> 01:03:00,781
I am calling child services.

910
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:02,115
Hey, Sam?

911
01:03:04,201 --> 01:03:05,536
I'm doing good, huh?

912
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:09,581
Real good.

913
01:03:12,334 --> 01:03:13,335
Come on.

914
01:03:14,378 --> 01:03:17,923
I can't wait to see what everyone's
gonna be for Halloween tomorrow.

915
01:03:18,006 --> 01:03:19,842
Group three, you can get your backpacks.

916
01:03:20,425 --> 01:03:21,426
Bye, sweetie.

917
01:03:21,718 --> 01:03:25,597
Hey, Sam. Do you have
a Halloween costume for tomorrow?

918
01:03:25,681 --> 01:03:29,309
Uh-huh. Penelope the Flying Princess.
Palmer got it for me.

919
01:03:29,935 --> 01:03:33,772
Penelope? That's exciting.
Okay, I can't wait to see it.

920
01:03:33,856 --> 01:03:35,524
- Goodbye, Miss Maggie.
- Bye.

921
01:03:44,867 --> 01:03:46,076
Quite an outfit.

922
01:03:46,702 --> 01:03:48,745
I can't get it to stay on my head.

923
01:03:49,955 --> 01:03:50,956
Come here.

924
01:04:03,468 --> 01:04:05,846
There you go. I hope that works.

925
01:04:06,555 --> 01:04:08,974
Me too. Thanks.

926
01:04:09,474 --> 01:04:10,517
You're welcome, kiddo.

927
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,356
Let me guess. Pink or purple.
You can't decide.

928
01:04:18,066 --> 01:04:20,611
I'm the flying princess cowboy.

929
01:04:20,694 --> 01:04:22,613
Let's ride. Giddy-giddy.

930
01:04:22,696 --> 01:04:25,866
Samantha is wearing a girl's costume.

931
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:28,368
She's probably wearing panties.

932
01:04:36,251 --> 01:04:38,253
Excuse me, class.

933
01:04:39,254 --> 01:04:42,466
Does anybody know where Miss Maggie is?

934
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:44,218
- You're right there!
- No.

935
01:04:44,301 --> 01:04:46,887
No, I'm not. I'm Principal Forbes.

936
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:49,181
And that's a fake mustache!

937
01:04:49,848 --> 01:04:53,560
It's a real mustache.
I grew it this morning.

938
01:04:53,644 --> 01:04:55,020
No!

939
01:04:55,103 --> 01:04:57,105
Miss Maggie must be playing hooky,

940
01:04:57,189 --> 01:05:00,567
'cause today Principal Forbes
is taking care of your classroom.

941
01:05:00,651 --> 01:05:03,737
- No.
- Yes, I am. You see,

942
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:08,325
that is the entire point of Halloween
or any other day of the year.

943
01:05:08,408 --> 01:05:11,161
You can just be whoever you wanna be.

944
01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:14,164
I'm a cowboy!

945
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:15,374
Is that an astronaut?

946
01:05:15,457 --> 01:05:16,792
And we got a witch.

947
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:18,168
And is that...

948
01:05:18,794 --> 01:05:22,381
That looks like a flying princess.
Yes, it does.

949
01:05:22,881 --> 01:05:24,091
And another one.

950
01:05:24,675 --> 01:05:25,801
And another one.

951
01:05:25,884 --> 01:05:29,221
How wonderful does everybody look today?

952
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:34,434
- Trick or treat!
- I've got some treats.

953
01:05:34,518 --> 01:05:36,228
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

954
01:05:36,311 --> 01:05:37,771
These are my favorite.

955
01:05:38,814 --> 01:05:41,149
- Wow. Nice place you got.
- Thank you.

956
01:05:41,233 --> 01:05:42,985
Who are you for Halloween?

957
01:05:43,068 --> 01:05:44,486
- Me?
- Yeah.

958
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:45,737
I was a janitor.

959
01:05:46,655 --> 01:05:48,240
You want to give me a hand?

960
01:05:48,323 --> 01:05:49,825
That's enough candy, Sam.

961
01:05:55,163 --> 01:05:57,040
- That was so good.
- Good, good.

962
01:05:57,124 --> 01:05:59,793
- How's he doing?
- He's watching TV in there.

963
01:06:00,252 --> 01:06:01,461
Boy loves TV.

964
01:06:02,087 --> 01:06:03,630
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

965
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:08,051
It turned out to be
a really good day at school today.

966
01:06:08,135 --> 01:06:09,178
That's good.

967
01:06:09,678 --> 01:06:11,597
I think he really had fun.

968
01:06:16,393 --> 01:06:18,145
And I'm glad you guys
stopped by for dinner.

969
01:06:19,229 --> 01:06:20,480
Me too.

970
01:06:22,191 --> 01:06:23,609
So, I gotta ask you something.

971
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:27,821
Okay.

972
01:06:30,199 --> 01:06:31,992
How did you end up in prison?

973
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:37,122
That's a longer story.

974
01:06:37,206 --> 01:06:38,957
I don't know. I don't get it.

975
01:06:40,167 --> 01:06:41,752
It's a fair question.

976
01:06:52,596 --> 01:06:55,807
Things were going okay at LSU.

977
01:06:57,643 --> 01:07:01,980
Until one game, I get hit so hard,
I can't even tell you my name.

978
01:07:04,691 --> 01:07:09,238
Couple surgeries,
and that was the end of football

979
01:07:09,738 --> 01:07:10,906
and school.

980
01:07:12,658 --> 01:07:16,745
Came back home. Started taking pills.

981
01:07:19,414 --> 01:07:20,624
Doing other things.

982
01:07:23,168 --> 01:07:24,670
I'd end up in jail for a night...

983
01:07:26,129 --> 01:07:27,881
swear I wouldn't do it again.

984
01:07:31,385 --> 01:07:32,678
There was this rich kid.

985
01:07:33,428 --> 01:07:34,805
He was always going on and on,

986
01:07:34,888 --> 01:07:38,058
bragging about how much money
his dad kept in the safe at the house.

987
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:42,855
One night, me and the guys, we broke in.

988
01:07:43,772 --> 01:07:45,524
Nobody was supposed to be there.

989
01:07:46,358 --> 01:07:47,985
His old man comes home.

990
01:07:49,152 --> 01:07:50,279
Had a gun.

991
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:58,537
I nearly beat him to death.

992
01:08:03,834 --> 01:08:06,128
And the next thing I know, I'm in prison.

993
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:11,133
You weren't alone?

994
01:08:11,675 --> 01:08:14,303
Don't matter. I did what I did.

995
01:08:17,598 --> 01:08:18,765
Yeah.

996
01:08:20,642 --> 01:08:22,185
But look at what you did today.

997
01:08:49,212 --> 01:08:50,214
He's out.

998
01:08:54,301 --> 01:08:55,301
Are you tired?

999
01:08:58,764 --> 01:08:59,765
No.

1000
01:10:10,794 --> 01:10:13,338
I swear that boy will sleep
through a freight train.

1001
01:10:20,345 --> 01:10:21,346
This was fun.

1002
01:10:26,059 --> 01:10:27,728
- All right.
- All right.

1003
01:10:29,104 --> 01:10:30,606
I guess I'll see you at school.

1004
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:36,069
- Good night.
- Good night.

1005
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:39,907
Still looking.

1006
01:10:45,954 --> 01:10:48,999
All right, guys.
I'll give you a few more minutes.

1007
01:10:49,082 --> 01:10:51,043
And it's okay if you make a mistake.

1008
01:10:51,126 --> 01:10:53,253
Sam, do you wanna have another tea party?

1009
01:10:53,337 --> 01:10:54,463
Can we play dress-up?

1010
01:10:54,922 --> 01:10:56,048
Of course.

1011
01:10:56,131 --> 01:10:57,799
- I'm in.
- Yeah.

1012
01:10:59,801 --> 01:11:02,387
What are we going to do, huh? Hey, Eddie.

1013
01:11:02,471 --> 01:11:04,223
Hey, they are so excited.

1014
01:11:04,306 --> 01:11:08,143
Listen, listen. Don't even rush yourself.
Just come whenever you're ready, okay?

1015
01:11:08,227 --> 01:11:10,979
And Daryl's stopping by too.
We can all have a beer.

1016
01:11:11,063 --> 01:11:13,732
- Say hello to Tommy.
- I will. We're gonna have fun.

1017
01:11:13,815 --> 01:11:15,984
- See you later, Palmer.
- See ya, bud.

1018
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:00,737
May I help you?

1019
01:12:02,114 --> 01:12:03,949
How's that air conditioner working out?

1020
01:12:07,536 --> 01:12:08,954
You're gonna get me in trouble.

1021
01:12:09,997 --> 01:12:10,998
Am I?

1022
01:12:16,253 --> 01:12:19,464
- I gotta go.
- No, you don't.

1023
01:12:19,548 --> 01:12:21,717
Yes. Yes, I do.

1024
01:12:26,513 --> 01:12:27,681
Hey.

1025
01:12:28,724 --> 01:12:29,725
Hey.

1026
01:12:31,059 --> 01:12:32,436
Will you help me with something?

1027
01:12:33,687 --> 01:12:35,397
- Yeah.
- Come here.

1028
01:12:39,776 --> 01:12:42,404
I don't know. All this stuff.

1029
01:12:43,488 --> 01:12:45,240
Do you know anybody who could use it?

1030
01:12:46,617 --> 01:12:48,702
I think my grandmother
would've loved that.

1031
01:12:52,414 --> 01:12:53,624
Yeah, I'm sure I do.

1032
01:12:59,713 --> 01:13:00,797
Sam!

1033
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:04,551
- Hey, bud.
- What happened to you?

1034
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:08,472
- Eddie, I am so...
- What the hell is going on?

1035
01:13:08,555 --> 01:13:11,235
I don't even know. I left him for a bit.
They were playing dress-up.

1036
01:13:11,308 --> 01:13:14,728
When I came back, he had makeup smeared
all over his face and he was crying.

1037
01:13:14,811 --> 01:13:16,772
I don't even know what happened.
I'm sorry.

1038
01:13:16,855 --> 01:13:18,607
It's okay. It's okay, sweetie.

1039
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:20,484
Hey, buddy. Hey.

1040
01:13:20,567 --> 01:13:22,653
You wanna tell me and Miss Maggie
what happened?

1041
01:13:24,613 --> 01:13:25,864
Hey. It's all right.

1042
01:13:26,949 --> 01:13:29,785
Was it the same ones that pick on you?
Were they over there?

1043
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:33,413
Listen to me, son.

1044
01:13:33,497 --> 01:13:36,917
I know you don't wanna hear this,
but sometimes you gotta hit 'em back.

1045
01:13:37,626 --> 01:13:38,752
Eddie.

1046
01:13:39,253 --> 01:13:40,504
They were bigger than me.

1047
01:13:40,587 --> 01:13:43,048
I know, son, but if you don't stand up
for yourself now,

1048
01:13:43,131 --> 01:13:45,008
those kids are never
gonna leave you alone.

1049
01:13:45,092 --> 01:13:46,093
Eddie.

1050
01:13:46,176 --> 01:13:48,387
They weren't kids.

1051
01:13:49,513 --> 01:13:51,390
What do you mean?

1052
01:13:51,849 --> 01:13:54,685
Okay, look at me, okay?
Who did this to you, Sam?

1053
01:13:55,853 --> 01:13:57,145
It's okay. You can tell us.

1054
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:01,316
Toby's dad.

1055
01:14:02,234 --> 01:14:03,277
What?

1056
01:14:03,944 --> 01:14:08,782
Toby's dad. Your friend, Daryl, he did it.

1057
01:14:12,744 --> 01:14:13,745
Hey, Eddie.

1058
01:14:16,123 --> 01:14:17,124
Hey, Eddie.

1059
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,502
Eddie. Hey, Eddie! Where are you going?

1060
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:22,337
Eddie, don't do...

1061
01:14:37,603 --> 01:14:41,356
Hey, look. He was already wearing a dress.
I just gave the little faggot some...

1062
01:14:42,107 --> 01:14:44,026
Palmer, no! What are you doing?

1063
01:14:44,109 --> 01:14:45,152
Stop!

1064
01:14:46,153 --> 01:14:47,654
- Eddie!
- Palmer!

1065
01:14:47,738 --> 01:14:49,615
- Palmer!
- Eddie! Hey!

1066
01:14:49,698 --> 01:14:51,867
- Get off me!
- Eddie, Eddie.

1067
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:53,785
What the hell you doing? My...

1068
01:14:53,869 --> 01:14:55,996
- Simmer down, man!
- Palmer. Palmer...

1069
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:58,332
Funny to you too, Coles, huh?

1070
01:14:58,415 --> 01:15:01,752
Seeing a grown man hold a little boy down,
make him cry while he put makeup on him?

1071
01:15:01,835 --> 01:15:04,213
- I was not... I wasn't there...
- The fuck you weren't!

1072
01:15:04,296 --> 01:15:06,673
- It was at your fucking house.
- I wasn't there.

1073
01:15:08,383 --> 01:15:09,968
Let's get one thing straight.

1074
01:15:10,928 --> 01:15:15,516
Your daddy comes to see me,
you ain't walkin' away this time.

1075
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:18,268
Believe me on that.

1076
01:15:19,895 --> 01:15:21,313
Twelve fucking years!

1077
01:15:33,116 --> 01:15:34,756
What's everybody lookin' at? Show's over.

1078
01:15:34,826 --> 01:15:36,370
- Fuck.
- Come on. Let's go.

1079
01:15:36,453 --> 01:15:37,955
- Get up.
- Oh, my God, Daryl.

1080
01:15:38,038 --> 01:15:39,206
Come on.

1081
01:15:40,249 --> 01:15:42,876
- Is he okay?
- Jesus H. Christ.

1082
01:15:53,637 --> 01:15:54,805
What are you gonna do?

1083
01:15:56,181 --> 01:15:57,724
Beat up everyone that picks on him?

1084
01:15:58,642 --> 01:16:00,686
No, just the ones over 30.

1085
01:16:00,769 --> 01:16:03,522
There are other ways to handle things.

1086
01:16:06,108 --> 01:16:09,152
- Are you gonna get in trouble?
- Daryl ain't gonna press charges.

1087
01:16:10,153 --> 01:16:11,196
Lucky you.

1088
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:15,701
Sam cried himself to sleep...

1089
01:16:16,618 --> 01:16:17,828
asking for you.

1090
01:16:27,629 --> 01:16:28,839
Hey, I...

1091
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:55,365
I got you this.

1092
01:17:06,168 --> 01:17:08,170
Sam. Listen to me.

1093
01:17:09,588 --> 01:17:12,257
What Daryl did to you was wrong.

1094
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:14,676
You know that, right?

1095
01:17:15,844 --> 01:17:17,638
You didn't do anything bad.

1096
01:17:18,764 --> 01:17:19,806
You understand me?

1097
01:17:20,349 --> 01:17:22,518
- Okay.
- Not a thing.

1098
01:17:23,977 --> 01:17:25,020
You hear me, son?

1099
01:17:25,812 --> 01:17:26,813
Yeah.

1100
01:17:27,564 --> 01:17:28,565
Okay.

1101
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:32,236
Hey. I got an idea.

1102
01:17:32,945 --> 01:17:33,946
Come on.

1103
01:17:35,364 --> 01:17:37,783
All right. Here's what we got so far.

1104
01:17:38,659 --> 01:17:41,161
"Dear Penelope's Flying Princess Club"...

1105
01:17:41,828 --> 01:17:43,914
- Did I get that right?
- Yeah.

1106
01:17:43,997 --> 01:17:47,793
"My name is Sam, and I would very much
like to be a member."

1107
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:52,130
Make sure you tell them how much I love
their show, and I watch it every day.

1108
01:17:52,214 --> 01:17:57,427
"I watch your show, and..."

1109
01:17:59,137 --> 01:18:01,014
I love it

1110
01:18:01,098 --> 01:18:06,311
"more than anything in the world."

1111
01:18:07,771 --> 01:18:08,772
All right.

1112
01:18:08,856 --> 01:18:10,858
All you gotta do
is sign your name right there.

1113
01:18:16,822 --> 01:18:18,448
Should be good to go.

1114
01:18:32,254 --> 01:18:33,463
Hey, Sammy.

1115
01:18:35,966 --> 01:18:37,759
Hi, baby.

1116
01:18:40,596 --> 01:18:43,307
Aren't you gonna come give
your mama a hug? Come on.

1117
01:18:43,849 --> 01:18:44,933
Hey, Mama.

1118
01:18:47,311 --> 01:18:50,147
Oh, boy. I missed you so much.

1119
01:18:51,481 --> 01:18:54,526
Look at you. Hi.

1120
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:57,070
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1121
01:18:57,154 --> 01:18:58,405
Yeah, I'm good.

1122
01:19:01,491 --> 01:19:03,285
I heard about Miss Vivian.

1123
01:19:04,203 --> 01:19:05,746
I'm sorry about that.

1124
01:19:07,915 --> 01:19:09,750
She was a good woman. I liked her.

1125
01:19:12,753 --> 01:19:15,172
Sammy, I think it's time for us
to go home, baby.

1126
01:19:15,255 --> 01:19:16,673
You wanna go get your stuff?

1127
01:19:17,466 --> 01:19:19,593
- Back home?
- Yeah.

1128
01:19:26,016 --> 01:19:28,393
- Don't forget this.
- I won't.

1129
01:19:30,896 --> 01:19:31,939
Hey.

1130
01:19:32,981 --> 01:19:34,149
We had a good time.

1131
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:38,737
And you can come and visit me
whenever you like.

1132
01:19:48,872 --> 01:19:49,873
All right.

1133
01:19:50,707 --> 01:19:52,626
I'll go get the rest of your stuff.

1134
01:19:52,709 --> 01:19:53,836
Thanks, Palmer.

1135
01:19:55,504 --> 01:19:56,588
Where'd you get that?

1136
01:19:57,256 --> 01:19:58,382
That ain't yours.

1137
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,135
Palmer got it for me for my birthday.

1138
01:20:03,303 --> 01:20:04,888
Hey. Guess what?

1139
01:20:06,056 --> 01:20:08,684
I got you the best present ever.

1140
01:20:09,268 --> 01:20:10,811
Greatest thing in the world.

1141
01:20:11,395 --> 01:20:15,357
And I had to travel so far to get it.
Far and wide.

1142
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,192
And I chased the rainbow for you.

1143
01:20:18,485 --> 01:20:19,945
- Really?
- Yeah.

1144
01:20:20,028 --> 01:20:21,363
And it's pretty.

1145
01:20:22,656 --> 01:20:24,032
I'm excited to give it to you.

1146
01:20:24,116 --> 01:20:25,325
All right, kiddo.

1147
01:20:25,701 --> 01:20:29,746
Wow. You really moved in here, huh?

1148
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:32,499
- Well, you were gone a while.
- Yeah.

1149
01:20:34,084 --> 01:20:35,169
Come on. Let's go.

1150
01:20:37,796 --> 01:20:40,507
Sam, I said it's time to go. Come on.

1151
01:20:41,633 --> 01:20:42,634
Go on.

1152
01:20:43,677 --> 01:20:47,014
Thanks for watching him for me.
Let's go get your present. Come on.

1153
01:20:47,097 --> 01:20:48,515
Let's go home.

1154
01:20:48,599 --> 01:20:50,267
I wanna take a bath.

1155
01:21:45,405 --> 01:21:46,615
Hey, is Sam okay?

1156
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:49,910
Shelly came back.

1157
01:21:51,286 --> 01:21:52,371
She did?

1158
01:21:54,456 --> 01:21:56,208
Didn't look too good either.

1159
01:21:57,167 --> 01:21:58,919
Kinda sickly, you know?

1160
01:21:59,962 --> 01:22:01,880
I'm sure he'll be back tomorrow.

1161
01:22:02,506 --> 01:22:03,674
I hope so.

1162
01:22:07,678 --> 01:22:09,096
- Hey...
- I'm gonna...

1163
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:11,640
- I'm gonna get back...
- Yeah, no. I'll let you get back.

1164
01:22:38,584 --> 01:22:39,585
Hey.

1165
01:22:40,711 --> 01:22:41,879
Where's your lunch box?

1166
01:22:43,589 --> 01:22:44,923
Jerry threw it away.

1167
01:22:47,009 --> 01:22:49,887
Did he? What'd he do that for?

1168
01:22:50,804 --> 01:22:53,765
He said my mama
was raising me to be a queer,

1169
01:22:53,849 --> 01:22:56,393
and he ain't living with no queer kid.

1170
01:22:59,563 --> 01:23:00,981
What does queer mean?

1171
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:05,485
Well, some people
think it means you're different.

1172
01:23:06,528 --> 01:23:07,696
Are you queer?

1173
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:10,991
Well, I'm different. That's for sure.

1174
01:23:14,578 --> 01:23:15,579
Hey.

1175
01:23:16,288 --> 01:23:17,873
You know what else we are?

1176
01:23:19,666 --> 01:23:20,834
Good-looking.

1177
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:25,214
No, don't laugh.
We're both good-looking fellas.

1178
01:23:25,297 --> 01:23:27,549
It intimidates people. Makes 'em afraid.

1179
01:23:29,968 --> 01:23:32,179
Plus you can never trust a guy
with a mullet.

1180
01:23:32,888 --> 01:23:34,223
What's a mullet?

1181
01:23:34,306 --> 01:23:37,309
It's creepy is what it is.
Come on, I'll give you a ride to school.

1182
01:23:37,935 --> 01:23:39,019
Thanks, Palmer.

1183
01:23:39,603 --> 01:23:42,314
Hey, how about after school
I take you to get a root beer float?

1184
01:23:42,397 --> 01:23:44,983
I can't. I gotta help my mama.

1185
01:23:45,442 --> 01:23:48,237
- Why?
- 'Cause we're moving to Jerry's.

1186
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,739
And I'm gonna have to go
to another school.

1187
01:23:53,283 --> 01:23:55,953
I guess I'll just have to visit you then.

1188
01:23:56,036 --> 01:23:57,037
Promise?

1189
01:23:57,955 --> 01:23:59,373
You got my word, kiddo.

1190
01:24:19,935 --> 01:24:23,605
Let's go. Come on. Christ.
Like mother like daughter. You two.

1191
01:24:23,689 --> 01:24:24,773
Yeah.

1192
01:24:25,691 --> 01:24:27,734
I love the commentary.

1193
01:24:27,818 --> 01:24:30,195
You always rush me. Don't rush me!

1194
01:24:58,974 --> 01:25:00,851
...you fucking touch me!

1195
01:25:00,934 --> 01:25:02,186
Get away from me!

1196
01:25:02,269 --> 01:25:04,813
Just calm the fuck down,
all right. This ain't my goddamn fault.

1197
01:25:04,897 --> 01:25:07,649
- Get the fuck away from me.
- Just going up here, just listening.

1198
01:25:07,733 --> 01:25:09,264
- Hey.
- Ain't like it's the first time.

1199
01:25:09,276 --> 01:25:10,777
Hey.

1200
01:25:10,861 --> 01:25:11,862
What was that?

1201
01:25:13,405 --> 01:25:15,365
What the fuck is going on? Where's Sam?

1202
01:25:17,534 --> 01:25:20,204
- Where is he?
- He's gone. He ain't here.

1203
01:25:23,373 --> 01:25:27,628
The fucking police.
The CPS, they took him away.

1204
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:36,929
Mother of the fucking year you are.

1205
01:25:41,058 --> 01:25:44,603
There's a case hearing with
his mother in family court on Monday.

1206
01:25:44,686 --> 01:25:47,606
The judge will decide then
if Sam is placed into a home

1207
01:25:47,689 --> 01:25:49,274
or returned to his mother.

1208
01:25:50,651 --> 01:25:54,655
Normally, we try to find relatives
for temporary custody.

1209
01:25:54,738 --> 01:25:56,532
I'll need you to fill out this paperwork.

1210
01:25:57,908 --> 01:25:59,785
I have a felony record.

1211
01:26:00,536 --> 01:26:02,204
Are you currently on parole?

1212
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:07,960
I'm sorry. The agency won't approve
a foster care license if you're on parole.

1213
01:26:11,004 --> 01:26:12,005
Can I see him?

1214
01:26:12,089 --> 01:26:14,258
- No.
- He's probably scared, ma'am.

1215
01:26:14,341 --> 01:26:16,885
- If he could just see a friendly face...
- Sir, I understand.

1216
01:26:16,969 --> 01:26:20,848
But not unless you're a parent,
a family member, or a legal guardian.

1217
01:26:23,058 --> 01:26:25,602
It's possible
the judge could make an exception.

1218
01:26:26,103 --> 01:26:27,771
It's unlikely.

1219
01:26:32,818 --> 01:26:33,986
What do you want?

1220
01:26:35,529 --> 01:26:36,655
Where's Jerry?

1221
01:26:38,156 --> 01:26:39,658
I don't know. You tell me.

1222
01:26:41,201 --> 01:26:44,079
Hey, you got a cigarette for me?

1223
01:26:49,751 --> 01:26:50,752
Thank you.

1224
01:27:00,304 --> 01:27:01,805
Why are you here, huh?

1225
01:27:06,226 --> 01:27:07,352
What's this?

1226
01:27:16,195 --> 01:27:17,821
A legal guardian?

1227
01:27:18,405 --> 01:27:20,532
You'd be signing Sam over to my care.

1228
01:27:23,785 --> 01:27:25,287
Why the fuck would I do that?

1229
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:28,665
Because unless you get clean, I don't see
the courts giving him back to you.

1230
01:27:30,167 --> 01:27:32,002
I need you to get outta my house.

1231
01:27:32,628 --> 01:27:33,754
Take it.

1232
01:27:45,349 --> 01:27:47,559
You think you can buy my son?

1233
01:27:47,643 --> 01:27:48,852
No.

1234
01:27:50,771 --> 01:27:53,106
- You think that you're better than me?
- No.

1235
01:27:53,190 --> 01:27:54,399
I think you do.

1236
01:27:55,234 --> 01:27:57,569
You think just 'cause you fucked me...

1237
01:27:58,779 --> 01:28:00,322
that you're his daddy?

1238
01:28:03,116 --> 01:28:04,660
You ain't his fucking daddy.

1239
01:28:05,285 --> 01:28:07,246
And you ain't fucking better
than me neither.

1240
01:28:07,329 --> 01:28:09,611
- And I don't want your money.
- I don't think I'm better than you.

1241
01:28:09,623 --> 01:28:12,042
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, I don't think I'm better than you.

1242
01:28:12,709 --> 01:28:15,170
Hell, maybe a little bit luckier
this time around.

1243
01:28:15,254 --> 01:28:17,297
But if something were to happen to you...

1244
01:28:18,507 --> 01:28:21,176
they will take Sam
and put him wherever they want.

1245
01:28:22,386 --> 01:28:23,762
- No.
- And you and I both know...

1246
01:28:23,846 --> 01:28:26,557
- No.
- ...he ain't like other boys.

1247
01:28:27,474 --> 01:28:29,643
They are gonna give Sammy back to me.

1248
01:28:31,228 --> 01:28:34,189
Sammy and I, we're gonna be fine. Okay?

1249
01:28:34,273 --> 01:28:38,735
We're gonna leave this shit town
behind us, and I'm gonna get clean.

1250
01:28:38,819 --> 01:28:40,821
I'm gonna do it, you know?

1251
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:44,157
Hey! I'm gonna buy us a big house.

1252
01:28:44,616 --> 01:28:48,662
I'm gonna show you, and you will see
that I can do it.

1253
01:28:48,745 --> 01:28:49,913
I can...

1254
01:28:50,706 --> 01:28:52,791
- Please take the money.
- No.

1255
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:55,711
- Shelly, listen to me.
- Don't look at me like that.

1256
01:28:55,794 --> 01:28:57,045
- Please.
- No.

1257
01:28:57,129 --> 01:28:58,505
Don't look at me like that.

1258
01:28:59,006 --> 01:29:00,591
Don't look at me!

1259
01:29:02,718 --> 01:29:03,802
Get outta my house.

1260
01:29:05,762 --> 01:29:07,181
Get outta my house!

1261
01:29:09,516 --> 01:29:12,519
Get the fuck out of my house!

1262
01:29:29,411 --> 01:29:31,496
I'm sorry to just show up like this.

1263
01:29:40,714 --> 01:29:42,716
Mr. Palmer, come with me.

1264
01:29:50,516 --> 01:29:55,312
Mr. Palmer, you appear to be moving
in the right direction, doing well.

1265
01:29:55,896 --> 01:29:59,816
And perhaps, once you get
your living situation squared away

1266
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,944
and are no longer on parole...

1267
01:30:03,028 --> 01:30:05,197
you can apply for the license again.

1268
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:06,281
Please.

1269
01:30:07,115 --> 01:30:09,117
I did what I did when I was younger,

1270
01:30:09,868 --> 01:30:12,788
and I got what I got,
so I ain't blaming nobody, Your Honor.

1271
01:30:13,622 --> 01:30:19,837
But truth is, I haven't felt like
I was good at anything in a long time...

1272
01:30:20,629 --> 01:30:21,630
until Sam.

1273
01:30:24,216 --> 01:30:28,512
My decision is that the boy
will remain under the care of the state.

1274
01:30:28,595 --> 01:30:30,722
He will be placed
in a registered foster home

1275
01:30:30,806 --> 01:30:34,184
until the mother is well enough
to regain custody.

1276
01:30:34,268 --> 01:30:36,770
Your Honor, she's a drug addict.
That ain't gonna happen.

1277
01:30:36,854 --> 01:30:38,230
But, for now, I'm sorry.

1278
01:30:38,313 --> 01:30:41,275
I have to deny your request
for temporary custody.

1279
01:30:41,358 --> 01:30:42,776
Don't do this.

1280
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:45,863
I know what it feels like
to be left alone.

1281
01:30:47,322 --> 01:30:48,615
I can't abandon that boy.

1282
01:30:48,699 --> 01:30:50,868
I will not abandon that boy.

1283
01:30:53,453 --> 01:30:54,663
I promise you...

1284
01:30:55,789 --> 01:30:57,875
nobody would ever have to worry
about Sam again.

1285
01:30:57,958 --> 01:30:59,668
I'd take real good care of him.

1286
01:31:00,752 --> 01:31:02,004
Real good care.

1287
01:31:03,255 --> 01:31:05,257
I'm sorry. That's my decision.

1288
01:31:11,722 --> 01:31:12,806
Excuse me, ma'am.

1289
01:31:12,890 --> 01:31:15,530
- I'm supposed to be there. Hey! I'm here.
- You can't go in there.

1290
01:31:15,559 --> 01:31:18,395
Sir, get your hands off me. I'm here.

1291
01:31:18,478 --> 01:31:20,981
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

1292
01:31:21,064 --> 01:31:23,192
- What is he doing here?
- Excuse me.

1293
01:31:23,275 --> 01:31:24,443
I am Sam's mother.

1294
01:31:24,526 --> 01:31:27,446
- Please do not approach the bench.
- Ma'am... Sorry, ma'am, no.

1295
01:31:29,364 --> 01:31:32,242
Your Honor, I'm sorry I'm late.
But I'm here.

1296
01:31:33,202 --> 01:31:36,747
Ma'am, them police,
they didn't even talk to Sam, okay?

1297
01:31:36,830 --> 01:31:39,333
They just came into my house,
and they took my boy away.

1298
01:31:39,416 --> 01:31:40,918
And they didn't even say why.

1299
01:31:41,001 --> 01:31:44,963
Miss Burdette, a complaint of abuse
and neglect has been made

1300
01:31:45,047 --> 01:31:46,673
to Child Protective Services.

1301
01:31:46,757 --> 01:31:50,010
And you were described
as being violent and agitated.

1302
01:31:50,093 --> 01:31:52,513
That ain't true. Ma'am, no.

1303
01:31:54,890 --> 01:31:58,393
Agitated, yes. I was agitated.
I'll admit to that.

1304
01:31:59,478 --> 01:32:01,897
I've had some health problems recently.

1305
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:04,066
I ain't trying to deny that.

1306
01:32:05,192 --> 01:32:09,071
Listen, I don't know what your notes say,
or what he said, or anyone else.

1307
01:32:09,571 --> 01:32:12,074
But I ain't never laid a hand on my boy.

1308
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:15,202
I ain't never even
raised my voice to Sammy.

1309
01:32:15,285 --> 01:32:16,745
Ma'am, he ain't an unhappy boy.

1310
01:32:16,828 --> 01:32:19,027
- Miss Burdette, I understand.
- I'll do whatever you want.

1311
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:21,583
What? You wanna piss-test me?
Then fine. Test me.

1312
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:24,545
I beg you.

1313
01:32:24,628 --> 01:32:27,381
Please don't send my little boy
to go live with no strangers.

1314
01:32:31,134 --> 01:32:32,678
He needs to be with his mama.

1315
01:32:34,221 --> 01:32:35,347
Please.

1316
01:33:08,922 --> 01:33:10,215
You good?

1317
01:33:10,924 --> 01:33:11,925
Sam?

1318
01:33:12,634 --> 01:33:14,845
Hey, Sammy. Come on, baby.

1319
01:33:15,888 --> 01:33:18,765
Hey. More to put in the car. Come on.

1320
01:33:25,272 --> 01:33:27,649
I am fucking tired
of your fucking bullshit!

1321
01:33:27,733 --> 01:33:29,193
Goddamn it! You again?

1322
01:33:29,276 --> 01:33:32,404
How many fucking times do I gotta tell you
to stop all these fucking things?

1323
01:33:32,487 --> 01:33:34,823
I am so tired of you!

1324
01:33:34,907 --> 01:33:37,201
I'm gonna burn down this fucking trailer.

1325
01:33:37,284 --> 01:33:40,621
And you and that half a fag kid
are gonna be out on the goddamn streets.

1326
01:33:40,704 --> 01:33:42,497
He's gonna be sucking dick by Christmas.

1327
01:33:42,581 --> 01:33:44,625
I am fucking tired
of your fucking bullshit.

1328
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:51,006
You lying fucking whore!
Go ahead. Fucking say it.

1329
01:33:51,089 --> 01:33:53,717
- What the fuck is wrong with you anyway?
- Mama!

1330
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:55,260
Get off of my mama!

1331
01:33:55,344 --> 01:33:56,512
- Get off of me!
- Mama!

1332
01:33:56,595 --> 01:33:59,002
- Get this goddamn kid off of me. Go!
- Don't hurt my baby, please!

1333
01:33:59,014 --> 01:34:00,724
- Get off me, you little shit!
- Please!

1334
01:34:00,807 --> 01:34:02,506
Is that what you want?
Let me tell you where I'm gonna put your...

1335
01:34:02,518 --> 01:34:04,311
- No! Hey!
- What?

1336
01:34:05,729 --> 01:34:07,523
Oh, my God.

1337
01:34:07,606 --> 01:34:09,525
You just made Jerry fly.

1338
01:34:10,067 --> 01:34:11,860
He just fucking flew.

1339
01:34:12,694 --> 01:34:14,988
I ain't never seen him do that before.

1340
01:34:17,032 --> 01:34:19,409
- Come on, Sam. Come on.
- He flew!

1341
01:34:19,952 --> 01:34:20,953
Hey.

1342
01:34:21,745 --> 01:34:23,705
Hey! Where are you going with my boy?

1343
01:34:24,206 --> 01:34:26,375
Hey! Son of a bitch!

1344
01:34:36,385 --> 01:34:39,346
Hey. It's gonna be all right. Okay?

1345
01:34:39,972 --> 01:34:41,223
- Okay.
- All right?

1346
01:34:41,306 --> 01:34:42,307
All right.

1347
01:35:00,492 --> 01:35:02,077
Stay here, Sam, okay?

1348
01:35:06,832 --> 01:35:08,500
You got a phone I can use?

1349
01:35:09,376 --> 01:35:10,377
Thank you.

1350
01:35:18,635 --> 01:35:19,636
Hello?

1351
01:35:20,053 --> 01:35:21,096
It's me.

1352
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:24,016
- I took Sam.
- Jesus Christ.

1353
01:35:24,099 --> 01:35:26,560
Eddie, Shelly called the police.
They're looking for you.

1354
01:35:27,686 --> 01:35:28,937
You gotta bring him back.

1355
01:35:29,021 --> 01:35:30,856
I can't. Not to that.

1356
01:35:30,939 --> 01:35:33,192
- Eddie, it's kidnapping.
- She ain't fit.

1357
01:35:33,275 --> 01:35:36,028
Maybe so, but where you gonna go?

1358
01:35:36,778 --> 01:35:39,281
You wanna go back to prison?
Is that what you want?

1359
01:35:40,782 --> 01:35:43,368
She's Sam's mother, Eddie.

1360
01:35:44,328 --> 01:35:47,956
Good or bad, right or wrong,
she's Sam's mother.

1361
01:35:58,634 --> 01:35:59,718
Call Coles.

1362
01:36:10,103 --> 01:36:11,355
What are we gonna do?

1363
01:36:36,004 --> 01:36:38,549
Everything's gonna be okay. All right?

1364
01:36:43,887 --> 01:36:45,305
There's my boy! Sammy!

1365
01:36:45,389 --> 01:36:48,100
- Get back.
- No! Hey. Sammy!

1366
01:36:48,183 --> 01:36:49,393
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, hey.

1367
01:36:49,476 --> 01:36:51,728
You fucking let go of me! Oh, my God. No!

1368
01:36:51,812 --> 01:36:52,896
Hold her.

1369
01:36:53,647 --> 01:36:57,150
- We gotta get out now. Come on.
- Sammy! Baby!

1370
01:36:57,234 --> 01:36:59,862
- Hold her. Steady.
- Sammy! Sammy!

1371
01:36:59,945 --> 01:37:02,281
- I'm gonna take you to court.
- Calm down.

1372
01:37:02,364 --> 01:37:04,004
Get her on the ground and keep her there.

1373
01:37:04,032 --> 01:37:05,200
- Shit.
- Sammy.

1374
01:37:05,284 --> 01:37:08,245
- I'm calm! Sammy, come to Mama.
- Look. She ain't in any shape.

1375
01:37:08,328 --> 01:37:10,747
- Out of her goddamn mind.
- Please, baby, come here.

1376
01:37:10,831 --> 01:37:12,249
Yeah.

1377
01:37:12,332 --> 01:37:14,614
I'm gonna take Sammy to Maggie's.
He'll stay there for now.

1378
01:37:14,626 --> 01:37:16,128
- My baby.
- All right?

1379
01:37:16,211 --> 01:37:18,797
I love you. Hi. Are you okay?

1380
01:37:18,881 --> 01:37:21,842
Did he hurt you? So worried about you.

1381
01:37:21,925 --> 01:37:23,844
- I'm so sorry. Truly.
- Turn around, Eddie.

1382
01:37:23,927 --> 01:37:25,220
Tell me you're okay.

1383
01:37:25,971 --> 01:37:27,389
Put your hands behind your back.

1384
01:37:28,473 --> 01:37:30,809
You just couldn't stay outta trouble,
could ya?

1385
01:37:31,977 --> 01:37:33,770
- Mama was so worried about you.
- Let's go.

1386
01:37:33,854 --> 01:37:36,231
Hey, baby. My precious boy.

1387
01:37:36,315 --> 01:37:38,192
Don't you let him go back into the system.

1388
01:37:38,275 --> 01:37:40,068
- It's okay.
- No!

1389
01:37:40,152 --> 01:37:41,737
No, Sammy, Sammy, no.

1390
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:44,781
- Let him go!
- Hey, hey. Come on, Sammy.

1391
01:37:44,865 --> 01:37:46,730
- Stop. Hey. I said stop it.
- You get your fucking hands off my boy!

1392
01:37:46,742 --> 01:37:48,481
- Knew they let you out too soon.
- You're hurting him.

1393
01:37:48,493 --> 01:37:50,120
- Come on, Sammy.
- No, baby!

1394
01:37:50,204 --> 01:37:52,706
- Let him go!
- Sammy.

1395
01:37:53,332 --> 01:37:54,917
Hey, baby. I love you.

1396
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,320
I got you. Your mama loves you.
I'm gonna take care of you.

1397
01:37:57,377 --> 01:37:59,838
- You never take care of me!
- I love you. Yes, I do.

1398
01:37:59,922 --> 01:38:02,674
- You never do!
- I do. I do. I got you, honey.

1399
01:38:02,758 --> 01:38:04,593
Let me go!

1400
01:38:06,345 --> 01:38:07,804
Palmer!

1401
01:38:10,349 --> 01:38:11,892
Palmer!

1402
01:38:12,935 --> 01:38:14,311
Go to your mama, Sam.

1403
01:38:15,062 --> 01:38:17,105
Palmer!

1404
01:38:18,607 --> 01:38:20,442
- It's okay.
- Palmer.

1405
01:38:21,026 --> 01:38:22,027
Sam.

1406
01:38:22,110 --> 01:38:23,612
Palmer!

1407
01:38:24,196 --> 01:38:25,572
Palmer!

1408
01:38:27,366 --> 01:38:28,617
Palmer!

1409
01:38:30,285 --> 01:38:31,703
Palmer!

1410
01:38:32,621 --> 01:38:34,831
Palmer!

1411
01:38:35,749 --> 01:38:37,292
Palmer!

1412
01:39:19,918 --> 01:39:21,253
You're free to go.

1413
01:39:23,130 --> 01:39:27,050
Shelly said you were just taking Sam
to get something to eat.

1414
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:31,471
Too high to remember, I guess.

1415
01:39:32,764 --> 01:39:34,850
So we gotta drop the charges.

1416
01:39:36,351 --> 01:39:38,145
Sam's still at Maggie's.

1417
01:39:47,070 --> 01:39:48,071
Hey.

1418
01:39:50,616 --> 01:39:51,700
I owed you one.

1419
01:39:53,243 --> 01:39:55,412
Yeah. You did.

1420
01:40:22,022 --> 01:40:23,607
You think I'm a terrible mother.

1421
01:40:36,495 --> 01:40:37,496
Hey, Sammy.

1422
01:40:45,212 --> 01:40:46,213
Hi, baby.

1423
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:02,771
Hey.

1424
01:41:07,860 --> 01:41:09,528
I know you're mad at me.

1425
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:12,281
It's okay.

1426
01:41:13,907 --> 01:41:15,409
I'd be mad at me too.

1427
01:41:18,036 --> 01:41:22,291
Well, I need to talk to you
about something real important.

1428
01:41:24,251 --> 01:41:25,961
Do you think we could do that?

1429
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:29,423
Yeah, I can sit here with you?

1430
01:41:29,506 --> 01:41:30,549
Yeah, Mama.

1431
01:41:31,884 --> 01:41:32,885
Thank you.

1432
01:41:43,896 --> 01:41:46,231
I've been doing some thinking
about some things.

1433
01:41:50,485 --> 01:41:53,280
I think it would be best
if you live with Palmer.

1434
01:41:56,700 --> 01:41:57,868
He's a good man.

1435
01:41:58,911 --> 01:42:00,829
And he cares about you so much.

1436
01:42:03,582 --> 01:42:04,583
And...

1437
01:42:13,592 --> 01:42:15,969
I'm struggling.

1438
01:42:17,346 --> 01:42:20,098
Baby, I'm really struggling now.

1439
01:42:25,521 --> 01:42:26,605
But...

1440
01:42:26,688 --> 01:42:28,440
Give me your hands.

1441
01:42:30,692 --> 01:42:32,694
It isn't because I don't love you.

1442
01:42:36,365 --> 01:42:38,408
I love you with all my heart.

1443
01:42:43,914 --> 01:42:45,207
What do you think?

1444
01:42:50,796 --> 01:42:52,464
You wanna live with Palmer?

1445
01:42:54,299 --> 01:42:56,051
You want him to be your daddy?

1446
01:42:56,134 --> 01:42:58,387
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1447
01:43:04,518 --> 01:43:06,520
Come here and give me a hug.

1448
01:43:20,450 --> 01:43:21,577
All right.

1449
01:43:45,309 --> 01:43:46,643
Got everything you need?

1450
01:43:46,727 --> 01:43:48,270
Looks like it.

1451
01:43:48,353 --> 01:43:51,190
Are we gonna have dinner tonight
with Miss Maggie?

1452
01:43:51,273 --> 01:43:53,942
Yep. She's cooking
your favorite, broccoli.

1453
01:43:54,026 --> 01:43:55,277
Broccoli?

1454
01:43:58,071 --> 01:44:00,741
Forbes's air conditioner is fixed.
I'll get it over to him.

1455
01:44:02,451 --> 01:44:03,452
Palmer.

1456
01:44:05,454 --> 01:44:06,663
I have something for you.

1457
01:44:17,466 --> 01:44:18,675
Your keys.

1458
01:44:20,302 --> 01:44:22,012
I think you've earned these.

1459
01:44:27,976 --> 01:44:29,102
Thank you, Sibs.

1460
01:44:31,021 --> 01:44:33,440
Well, Junior don't like to wait.
Get on outta here.

1461
01:44:40,572 --> 01:44:42,741
- Bye, Sam.
- Bye, Emily.

1462
01:44:43,617 --> 01:44:45,077
Hey, when's our next tea party?

1463
01:44:45,619 --> 01:44:47,454
I don't know. You tell me.

1464
01:44:48,747 --> 01:44:50,249
I don't know the schedule.

1465
01:44:56,713 --> 01:44:58,924
Come on. We gotta go pick something up.

1466
01:45:21,196 --> 01:45:23,407
Hey, Sam? Come here.

1467
01:45:27,911 --> 01:45:28,912
It's for you.

1468
01:45:32,583 --> 01:45:34,501
I've never got mail before.

1469
01:45:34,585 --> 01:45:36,128
Open it. See what it says.

1470
01:45:53,770 --> 01:45:55,606
Look at it. There's a golden star.

1471
01:45:55,689 --> 01:45:58,317
And look at my name. It's right here.
Sam Burdette, and...

1472
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:00,319
Yeah. Yeah.

1473
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:05,949
Hey.

1474
01:46:06,033 --> 01:46:07,159
Congratulations.

1475
01:46:09,171 --> 01:46:14,171
