1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,625
Yeah.

3
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:43,916
Who are you?

4
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,250
What are you doing in my room?

5
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,333
Where's Michael?

6
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,375
Ah!

7
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,166
Huh?

8
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,791
Ah!

9
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,750
Ah!

10
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:21,791
You missed!

11
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,375
Come on!

12
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,666
This old bitch.

13
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,333
Shit.

14
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,458
Works every time.

15
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,833
With your old ass.

16
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,500
When was the last time
you been to the dentist, huh?

17
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,125
Money.

18
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,750
Do you know what the definition
of insanity is, Sasha?

19
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:20,375
Doing the same thing over and over
and expecting a different result.

20
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:25,416
You cling to the old ways
like a tick on a dog's ass.

21
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,125
And look at where that's gotten us.

22
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,166
You've made your point.

23
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,750
I accept your terms.

24
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,833
I think we're a little
beyond that now, don't you?

25
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,125
I made a mistake.

26
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,000
You want this? You have it.

27
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,666
There you go again, lacking imagination.

28
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,708
"You, our, yours."

29
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:49,333
These are words of division, darling.
And divided, we are vulnerable.

30
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,500
But together?

31
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,958
The sky is the limit.

32
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,750
And why rent when you can own?

33
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,916
No. No, no, no. No, no, no!

34
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,041
No!

35
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:11,208
We've got big plans
for the Valley, <i>cabrón.</i>

36
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,375
Maybe we can dig you up in 100 years

37
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,291
and show you
what we've done with the place.

38
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,916
No, no. Please, no!

39
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,666
No. No!

40
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,416
Hey, Bud. Nice look.

41
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,833
…everything, the package isn't here.
Bud, I need your rent.

42
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,541
So I'll look again…

43
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:57,250
Oh, shit.

44
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,875
I'm calling because your husband
is late again to pick up Paige.

45
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,500
Do you have an ETA
of when we should expect him?

46
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,583
All right, but this is
the third time this week that he's late.

47
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,916
You shouldn't have to remind him that…

48
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,500
Just a sec. He's pulling up.

49
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,583
Paige!

50
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,625
- Hey, Daddy!
- Come on, baby!

51
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,416
Well, what up?

52
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,541
- Who's your favorite daddy?
- You.

53
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,958
I'm your only daddy, I hope. What's up?

54
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,625
- You're late, you know?
- What?

55
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,916
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

56
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,166
You know why I'm late? 'Cause this job.

57
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,041
- Work is dumb.
- Oh, well, yes it is.

58
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,333
And what do you have in your hand? Oh…

59
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,666
- A little something.
- Shaboom! I love that.

60
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,458
How about this? Hmm?

61
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,958
- All right.
- Can we go to Yogurtworld?

62
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,333
Yogurtworld. Oh, Pickle, I don't know.

63
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,583
Your mom is already upset
because we're late.

64
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,250
Whose fault is that?

65
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,166
Harsh.

66
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,583
But true. Roll the dice.

67
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,333
And we gonna roll out. Here we go.

68
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,625
Hands in the air!

69
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,041
We taking off.

70
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,000
Yogurtworld, we're on the way.

71
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,416
Yogurtworld!

72
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,083
I'm gonna get strawberry.
There it is.

73
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,791
Daddy's getting… strawberry.

74
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Pow.

75
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,583
Wow.

76
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,625
Boom! Got it.

77
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,416
- Boom!
- Yeah. Boom.

78
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,250
Got it.

79
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:53,916
Got it.

80
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,916
You got it.

81
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You're so weird.

82
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,958
If you only knew. All right, come on.

83
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,958
Excuse me, do you guys have
any Black History Month discounts?

84
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,708
Home sweet home.

85
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:28,791
Home sweet…

86
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,500
- We home.
- We home.

87
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:35,666
You're late.

88
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,791
- Hey.
- Hi.

89
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,041
We went to Yogurtworld.

90
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,583
Oh! Did you?

91
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,041
Snitches get stitches.
We were gonna keep that between us.

92
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,000
Sorry.

93
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,791
It's all good. Gimme five on your way up.

94
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,916
Nothing can stop you.
You're all the way up.

95
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,583
Making a ten-year-old
a part of your lies now. Charming.

96
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,583
She told me that she liked
hanging out with her old man. I was like…

97
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,125
Oh, she wanted to hang out with you.

98
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,708
That's something she could a done
if you'd taken her to school like I asked.

99
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,333
Well, I told you I had to go and...

100
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,458
That pool cleaning appointment
this morning?

101
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:06,875
- Exactly.
- Right.

102
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,250
Whose house was it?

103
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,500
It was Mrs… uh… Mrs. Jones' house.

104
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,416
Where's she live?

105
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:18,208
She, uh… With Mr. Jones. That's exactly…

106
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,000
- Right over there on Mr. Jones Way.
- Oh my God. Bud.

107
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,375
We'd get much further
if you'd be straight with me.

108
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,041
- I'm being straight.
- You're not.

109
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,958
I'm being straight, but the question is,

110
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,458
what is that sponge doing on the ground?

111
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,166
And this? What is all this?

112
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,041
I am fixing the broken tile.

113
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,500
Mm-hmm. I see that. And why?

114
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,833
Uh, what does it matter?

115
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,458
- You don't live here anymore.
- Wow, that's what we doing?

116
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,833
What I was gonna tell you
is that this tile goes…

117
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,750
Joss, what's this? This a new door?

118
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:46,875
Uh…

119
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,625
A door with five locks doesn't exactly

120
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,875
send the right impression
to potential buyers.

121
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,000
Buyers? Buyers?
What are you talking about, Joss?

122
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,333
I didn't want to tell you this way, but…

123
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,875
I'm thinking about selling the house
and taking my mom up on her offer.

124
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,625
You and your momma.

125
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:07,750
Florida?

126
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,370
What are you talking about?
You can't move to Florida.

127
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,458
All her friends are here.
I'm here. Her world is here.

128
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:14,541
She needs stability.

129
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,000
She has stability.
She got you. She got me.

130
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,250
She got Yogurtworld.
Ain't no Yogurtworld in Florida!

131
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,875
Yeah, and she also has a school

132
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,208
that she's not gonna be able to go to
unless we pay tuition by Monday.

133
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,583
Then let's pay the tu… Mon...

134
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,708
Monday? Monday, like in seven days?

135
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,666
Yeah, which you would know
if you had checked your voice mails.

136
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,541
Is that the stability you talk about?

137
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,125
- How much is it?
- Five grand.

138
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,916
Five thousand dollars for a child?

139
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,458
Mm-hm. And she needs braces.

140
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,875
- What's wrong?
- Her teeth are jacked up.

141
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:43,041
She always says she likes her teeth
'cause they look like my teeth.

142
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,208
That's my point.

143
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,583
Okay. Well, how much are braces?
What? Five, six hundred dollars?

144
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,250
- Without insurance, try six grand.
- Six grand?

145
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,791
But I did find a guy who quoted me $4,800.

146
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,166
- I know we done been through a whole lot.
- Yeah.

147
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,500
Just, please, don't take my daughter away.

148
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,625
Till Monday. Just give me till Monday.

149
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,791
Ten grand. Tuition, teeth, everything.

150
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,666
Okay, fine. I will give you till Monday.

151
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,583
Come on, hug me.

152
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,916
- Hug me.
- I'm hugging you.

153
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,416
- Stop listening to your mom. She drinks.
- What?

154
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,291
- Bud.
- What?

155
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,750
I have one more question.

156
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:27,416
Paige said that there's
a porn star living in your building?

157
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,750
How does she even know
what a porn star is?

158
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,416
It's the Valley, Joss.
They live amongst us.

159
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,666
Fellas. Sup, baby?

160
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,208
Who's thirsty? Hmm?

161
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,791
Business is booming, I see.

162
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,041
What's up, Eddie? Oh!

163
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,666
You always fast.

164
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,666
All right.

165
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,870
Troy!

166
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,250
Decided to take me up on my offer?

167
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,041
Not today, not tomorrow, not anytime.

168
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,041
- Here, you thirsty?
- Ooh. Thank you!

169
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,666
- Get some of that in you.
- Fifteen hundred is good money.

170
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,416
Like I said, Troy,
Snake Eyes ain't for sale, now.

171
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,375
Everything's for sale.
You just have to be desperate enough.

172
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,458
- So what do you got for Troy?
- Desperate, huh?

173
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:48,458
Mm-hmm.

174
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,333
That's what I got for Troy.

175
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,041
Money. All right.

176
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,125
Right there.

177
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,083
- Ooh, nice.
- Count that.

178
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,666
Let's see, uh…

179
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,916
- Oh, this is a young male.
- Mm-hmm.

180
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,708
Garden-variety, it's like Eastern…

181
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,625
Hey, smoker…

182
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,500
- Nasty habit, don't you think?
- Yeah.

183
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:10,208
He would have died from smoking
if he wasn't dead already.

184
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,291
Count the shit up.

185
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,125
Let's check this out.
Uh, yeah, you see there?

186
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,291
- Yeah, solid bloodline.
- Mm-hm.

187
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,791
Must've gotten here
through Mexico or something.

188
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,791
- He fed recently, you see that?
- Yeah.

189
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,083
Okay. Well, how much?

190
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,708
{\an8}Eight hundred? $800? A piece?

191
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:31,916
No, both.

192
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,375
Troy, what are you talking about?
Look at that again.

193
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,000
- That's worth at least four grand.
- Down at the union.

194
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,833
- Why don't you try the union?
- Come on.

195
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,500
I can't go union. You know that.

196
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,666
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I forgot you can't go to the union.

197
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,291
That's why you're coming to me. Huh?

198
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,958
And I'm offering you 800 for both.

199
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,958
All right, forget it.
Just check the Elder's.

200
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,041
Elder?

201
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:55,500
That's a different story. That's 20 grand.

202
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,375
Boom. Perfect. Done.

203
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,791
Yeah.

204
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,041
If she had been an Elder,

205
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,291
which she's not.

206
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,500
Check this out.

207
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,958
A decade early
and a whole lot of dollars short,

208
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:11,375
so I can give you like two grand for this.

209
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,666
- Two thousand, Troy?
- Mm-hm.

210
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,958
Two thousand?

211
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,333
I don't think you understand.
I need cash today.

212
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:19,541
Then go and rob a bank or do something.
I'm a businessman!

213
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,208
Forget the Elder's.
How about this? Silver.

214
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,291
Hmm?

215
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,125
Silver? This is…

216
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:29,791
- Just gonna put that in your mouth, huh?
- This plated shit? Please, Bud.

217
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,083
You want to make a deal or not?

218
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,500
Shit.

219
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,333
Snake Eyes, 1,500.

220
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,083
Ah. Twelve.

221
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,166
You said 1,500 when I walked in here.
It is 1,500.

222
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,250
Before I knew you were desperate.

223
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,041
That's everything I have.

224
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,708
Well, I think you have something else.

225
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,625
Are those Jordans?

226
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,166
What size?

227
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Hey. Hey, Pickle. How you doing?

228
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,166
<i>Dad, are we moving?</i>

229
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,375
- Are we what?
<i>- Are we moving?</i>

230
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,458
No. No. What makes you think that?

231
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,875
<i>Mom says I might have
to start a new school.</i>

232
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,708
That's what Mom says, huh?

233
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:44,541
Well, you know Mom is a jokester,
and I love her to death but, uh…

234
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,833
But we're not going anywhere.

235
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,791
You're not going anywhere, okay?

236
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,250
<i>Okay, good. Thanks, Daddy.</i>

237
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,541
- I love you.
<i>- I love you too!</i>

238
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,458
I need you, bro.

239
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:24,583
<i>We have already agreed
to take delivery of the product</i>

240
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,666
<i>and to help with placement in Simi Valley.</i>

241
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,416
<i>You had no authority to take out Sasha.</i>

242
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,083
<i>I'm gonna have to rethink our deal.</i>

243
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,583
Sasha is the past,
and I am the future.

244
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,000
We already own the night,

245
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,333
but my product
will allow us to seize the day.

246
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,541
So here is your choice.

247
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:50,000
You join me and we take over the Valley,
or you can join him. <i>Comprendes?</i>

248
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:54,208
It's just one man.

249
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,208
I can still smell him.

250
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,750
Find him.

251
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:22,291
Big J, you ain't changed a bit, baby.
I see you. What's happening?

252
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,208
You know me,
cutting necks and cashing checks.

253
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:25,625
Yeah. Thanks for meeting me, man.

254
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:29,041
Least I can do for the player that
snatched my ass out the sandbox twice.

255
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:30,125
How's Seeger?

256
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Same.

257
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:33,291
- Or worse.
- Damn.

258
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,500
You think he'll listen?

259
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,916
- Things have changed since you left.
- I ain't never left, Big J.

260
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,250
Well, since you got
your ass kicked out the union.

261
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:43,541
Look here. I'm putting my name and my ass
on the line by vouching for you.

262
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:45,083
Can you play this shit by the books?

263
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:48,208
I got to. I got to get that union card,
or I'm gonna lose my family.

264
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,583
Look, I need ten large
in the next five days

265
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:52,666
or Joss is gonna take Paige
down to Florida.

266
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,583
That's bad.

267
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:56,375
Union is the only place
gonna give me that kind of coin.

268
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:58,583
- I got you. Lock and load.
- All right.

269
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,666
She's done this before, man.
Pump faking, whatever.

270
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,458
But right now it seems like it's real.

271
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:14,208
Momoko.

272
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:16,541
Yes?

273
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,708
Pink penguin puffy pants.

274
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:26,291
See you ain't missed a step, Big J.

275
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,791
<i>J.J. Perry to the trade counter.</i>

276
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:49,875
Wow.

277
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,541
<i>J.J. Perry to the trade counter.</i>

278
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:57,291
I don't know how I feel about this.

279
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:04,166
Things really done changed
around here, huh?

280
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,166
Yeah, we ain't just 818 no more.

281
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,541
We done went international.

282
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:09,833
Look, Paris even blowing up tonight.

283
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:13,416
Bet money's good out there.

284
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:16,000
Let's go and get this thing over with.

285
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,500
How's the shirt look?

286
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:23,375
Stop being nervous, man.
Pull yourself together.

287
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:29,583
Hey, Big John.

288
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:30,833
Well, hello, sunshine.

289
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:34,208
He's expecting you,
but he's in one of his moods today.

290
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:53,458
I took this meeting
out of respect for you, Big John.

291
00:26:53,541 --> 00:26:56,166
God knows I wouldn't be
sitting here without your support.

292
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,416
But, uh, I'm certain we all remember

293
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,583
that Mr. Jablonski's previous tenure
as a union member was…

294
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,458
Chock-full of incidents.

295
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:10,500
Let's just take a look.

296
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:16,541
North ridge, 2014, violated code 103.

297
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:20,041
Encino, 2015, fleshed out a nest

298
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:23,666
while a child's birthday party
was unfolding next door,

299
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:29,166
endangering civilians,
violating codes 921, 833, and 605,

300
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,250
the worst of which was the failure
to notify law enforcement in due time.

301
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:36,583
- That was a good bust. What happened was...
- And to top it all off…

302
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:40,125
Canoga Park, 2017,

303
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:45,166
violated code 101,
endangering a fellow union member's life.

304
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,458
Critical injury sustained.

305
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:52,166
He already had… gout. He had gout.

306
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:56,791
Each of these incidents…
meriting a lifelong suspension.

307
00:27:57,541 --> 00:28:02,333
And yet, time and again,
you were given warnings.

308
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:06,958
Why should I extend you
yet another lifeline?

309
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:10,083
Ralph, let me be the first to tell you.

310
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:12,708
- Bud here, he's a new man.
- Yeah.

311
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:13,958
Is that right?

312
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:16,333
Yes, sir. Absolutely. I'm a changed man.

313
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:18,708
I've cut out, uh…

314
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:22,916
Pork and cartoons and minimal white women.

315
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:25,625
Bud, I'm curious. Uh…

316
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:31,125
If you were in my position sitting
across from a man such as yourself,

317
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:35,791
would you let you back in?

318
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:39,833
If that person
that is in question admits fault

319
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:42,625
and be apologetic, which I am, and,

320
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:44,416
on top of that, I just…

321
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:48,000
Look, Ralph…

322
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:49,958
Mr. Seeger, I just…

323
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:53,375
I really need to get out there.
I need to do good.

324
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:56,583
I promise, if you give me that opportunity
I'm not gonna mess it up.

325
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:05,541
One last chance.

326
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:08,291
Now that we, uh, got that part settled,

327
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:12,708
I'm gonna go freshen up my coffee
and let you gentlemen cross those T's.

328
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:16,500
That's a great guy. Great guy.

329
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,375
Really appreciate this second chance.

330
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,778
I don't know what the hell
that man sees in you, Jablonski.

331
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,458
I mean, I know you served together,
but, frankly, I don't care.

332
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:32,458
I've made it my life's work
keeping cowboys like you out of the union,

333
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:34,125
so I'll be watching you.

334
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:45,083
Quite.

335
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,000
Fill these out, all of them.

336
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:52,250
Once you pay your initial dues,

337
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,133
we'll get you started
on the health care plan.

338
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:55,458
There's dental included, right?

339
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:58,208
After a probationary period lasting…

340
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:00,500
30 days.

341
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:02,958
Come on, man. Three days.

342
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:04,625
Two weeks.

343
00:30:04,666 --> 00:30:06,500
One.

344
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:09,208
Fine.

345
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,708
With a union rep
accompanying him in the field.

346
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:15,583
- Generous. Thank you.
- Great.

347
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,041
All right. Thanks, and, uh…

348
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:21,083
I want the night shift.

349
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:24,083
- Not on my life.
- Come on, Seeger.

350
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:26,625
- That's where the big money is!
- No. Not a chance.

351
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:28,791
Amount of shit
you stirred up working night shift,

352
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:31,791
you expect me to let you
back out there where the sun don't shine?

353
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:33,291
Fine.

354
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,375
Day shift.

355
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,375
Good. Anything else?

356
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:38,958
No.

357
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:43,041
Oh, yeah. I got some,
um, teeth I need to sell.

358
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:44,041
Go to the cage.

359
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:46,166
Seeger, thank you kindly.

360
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,291
Mm-hmm.

361
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:49,083
And remember, Bud,

362
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:51,750
one last strike.

363
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:55,666
Is… Are you referring to bowling, because…

364
00:30:56,833 --> 00:31:00,291
- I'm saying there's a strike in bowl...
- You're back. That's all that matters.

365
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:13,791
Carol.

366
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,708
Carol, did you eat my yogurt again?

367
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:20,000
I even wrote my name on the lid today,

368
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:23,750
so you literally had to peel back
my name to get to the yogurt.

369
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,750
What? You can't hear me?

370
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,208
I'm gonna fart in my yogurt
and you're gonna eat my fart.

371
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:32,333
Next.

372
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,916
Mr. Jablonski?

373
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Yeah. Teeth.

374
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:42,708
So I look at it like this.
I get back out there, do what I gotta do,

375
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,875
you know, for Mr. Mullet.

376
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:50,500
This is chipped, female.

377
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:55,291
Appears to be an almost Elder,
roughly 90 years old.

378
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:57,175
Ninety?
You probably need to check that again.

379
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:59,125
- You sure it's 90?
- I'm sure.

380
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,208
Huh.

381
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:02,541
Okay, whatever.

382
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:04,625
Full price still, right?

383
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:07,250
I'm sorry. Code 107 in the book
clearly states anything...

384
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:09,166
Enough of the codes. It's fine.

385
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:19,000
- That's the net for the teeth.
- Yeah, I'll come in… Hey!

386
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:22,666
However, due to
the truncated processing time,

387
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,750
Mr. Seeger would like me to inform you
we need your dues up front,

388
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:27,375
which, of course, is $5,000.

389
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:28,875
$5,000? I thought it was two?

390
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:31,291
Those are 2017 rates, Mr. Jablonski.

391
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:35,166
Then there is 15%
off the top of every fang,

392
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:39,833
and we have to hold 50%
until we receive your paperwork.

393
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,916
And, of course, $10
for your membership card,

394
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,083
which gets you one free app
at Cheesecake Factory.

395
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:46,966
- I don't like cheesecake.
- Do you have that?

396
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:49,541
Why won't you take the $10 out of that?
Taking everything else.

397
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:52,083
You don't have cash on you?
You wanna make me split this?

398
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:57,958
Okay, you are good to go.

399
00:32:58,041 --> 00:32:59,041
Am I?

400
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:02,916
If you have any issues with this,

401
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,500
Carol right here would be happy
to further assist you.

402
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,291
Oh, great. I see you met your union rep.

403
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:09,875
Huh.

404
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:10,958
What?

405
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:15,125
Come on, Bud.

406
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:19,666
Sir, please.

407
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:21,541
That new girl's a smoke show.

408
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:24,916
Right, but I'm begging you to reconsider.
I'm not meant for the field.

409
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,541
I just bought an ergonomic chair
with my own money. I'm all in on the desk.

410
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:30,458
That's why I need you out there with him.

411
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,500
Right.
Someone who knows the codes to the letter.

412
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:33,767
- Okay, but...
- Hey, hey, hey.

413
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:35,375
Do you want to move up here?

414
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:37,750
You gotta get your ass
out in the field. All right?

415
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:38,833
Think about it this way,

416
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,833
you're gonna be
my eyes and ears, my friend.

417
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:41,750
- Right?
- Right...

418
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:45,416
And the minute he messes up,
the minute he goes against code,

419
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:49,208
you'll be there
reporting it back to me, right?

420
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:51,916
The sooner he fucks up,

421
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,708
the sooner
your sweet cheeks are in Carol's desk.

422
00:33:58,208 --> 00:33:59,208
You work out?

423
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:02,458
- A little.
- Yeah, thought so.

424
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,750
You're late.

425
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:31,291
Close it.

426
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:40,625
I was actually here
an hour ago, but you weren't,

427
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:42,416
so I went to go get us breakfast.

428
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:49,916
I got you an organic,
gluten-free, paleo bran muffin.

429
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:52,208
Really? Thank you.

430
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,666
- I was starving.
- That was a six-dollar muffin.

431
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,500
- What do you have on?
- What?

432
00:34:57,583 --> 00:35:00,125
- What are you wearing?
- Just, like, normal clothes.

433
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:02,791
The handbook says blend in on the hunt.
Be inconspicuous.

434
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:05,125
You have on a suit.
How's that inconspicuous?

435
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:07,541
You have on a suit.
We're in the Valley. In the summertime.

436
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:09,375
- It's a summery suit.
- A summery suit?

437
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:11,541
- Juniper green. Yes.
- What is juniper green?

438
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:14,416
A hue of green I found to be complementary
against my skin tone.

439
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,500
Whatever it is, don't wear it again.

440
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:21,291
Look, I'll put myself together,
and we'll take off, all right?

441
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:24,458
- Do you have somewhere I can hang this?
- Yep.

442
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:29,000
Not there.

443
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:37,458
I'll just… hold on to it.

444
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:39,791
This ain't gonna last.

445
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:52,666
Got enough weapons and ammo in here
to take down El Jefe, huh?

446
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,625
What you know about El Jefe?

447
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:58,541
Oh, come on.
Legendary 700-year-old European vampire.

448
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:00,541
Some say he's
at the top of the LA drug trade,

449
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,500
just waiting for his moment to re-emerge.

450
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:05,583
Fangs so sharp, with just one
you could buy a mansion in Bel Air.

451
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:06,791
Hmm.

452
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,333
You sound like Big John.

453
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,750
Whole lot of gibberish.
You know that's a crock of shit, right?

454
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,333
I didn't take you for
an arts and crafts guy.

455
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:19,500
What are these about?

456
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:20,958
Wanna keep your hands off my shit?

457
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:23,625
It's my trophy case.

458
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:25,500
For each one that I kill, I, uh…

459
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,263
They're already dead,
but you get my drift.

460
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:36,708
'Cause they're allergic to wood. Smart.

461
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:39,541
They're allergic to wood,
but not just any wood. It's mpingo wood.

462
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:42,500
The strongest African hardwood.
Not that Ikea shit.

463
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:45,416
We mix it with the garlic.
The wooden bullets pierce the heart.

464
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,184
- The silver...
- Silver to the throat. Right.

465
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:50,083
Yeah. Cuts the head off… usually.

466
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,541
Usually. Right, you are
referring to Uber Vamps,

467
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:54,333
who have come back from decapitation.

468
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:57,916
Not if you blast the heart with wood
before you cut their throats with silver.

469
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,208
Mm-hmm. You also forgot to mention
that you can kill them by burning them.

470
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:03,791
I didn't forget anything.
That's how I get my money.

471
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:05,833
Why would I burn the fangs?
I don't do that.

472
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:08,000
Listen, Guacamole Suit,

473
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:11,000
right there on the shelf,
grab that for me.

474
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:13,000
Get that, we'll take off.

475
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:15,791
And remember, whatever you do, don't…

476
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:17,916
Drop my shit.

477
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,500
So, uh… where we going?

478
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:28,166
I'm going hunting. I don't know about you.

479
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:40,083
Why you wearing the seat belt like that?

480
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:41,916
Um, yeah,

481
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,458
I mean, usually the seat belts aren't
like this complicated and heavy. But…

482
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:48,583
It's not complicated.
It's just a seat belt. It protects you.

483
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:49,666
Sure.

484
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,880
Sure. It's still protecting me though.
If anything happened, it's just...

485
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,833
See? It still catches me.

486
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,500
I see.

487
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:02,458
It's gonna be a long day.

488
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,208
So, are you gonna tell me
what we're doing at an animal shelter?

489
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:16,541
I'm gonna tell you shit.

490
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:22,916
What you know about Juvies?

491
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:26,291
Juvies or Juveniles, AKA Zombie Vamps,

492
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:29,166
formed when an already young vamp
turns somebody else.

493
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,083
Instead of the strength of a full vamp,

494
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:34,083
they lack regenerative abilities
and appear more dead than alive.

495
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:36,833
They can't process human blood yet,
so what do they do?

496
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:39,291
- I'm aware.
- They feed off of small animals, rodents.

497
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:40,541
So you've read the book?

498
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:42,375
I don't have to read it. I'm out here.

499
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:44,958
What about different species of vampires?

500
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:49,625
I know there are five types. Southern,
Eastern, Spider, Uber, and Juvenile.

501
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:52,916
They're largely solitary,
but when together, there is a hierarchy.

502
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,833
They organize by age. What else?

503
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,750
Sunlight's the only thing
they're scared of.

504
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,875
They can't reproduce,
but they can turn people.

505
00:38:58,958 --> 00:38:59,958
Should I continue?

506
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:02,541
- What about familiars?
- You think this guy's one?

507
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:04,125
I don't know. You tell me.

508
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,041
Hmm?

509
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:07,333
I think he fits the profile.

510
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:08,666
- You think so?
- Absolutely.

511
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,958
More powerful vamps
have more powerful familiars.

512
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:13,500
And when it comes to Juvies,
a little kid like this,

513
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:16,791
he's probably grabbing those cats for 'em,
try to get 'em turned.

514
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,583
- Oh, man.
- What?

515
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:24,875
No, I'm just a big cat lover.
I got two of them myself.

516
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:26,250
Oh. Okay.

517
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:27,791
Well, that explains it.

518
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:29,666
- Want to see a picture?
- No, I don't.

519
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:31,166
Maybe later.

520
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:35,958
All right. Here we go.

521
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,250
There's his car.

522
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,958
Canoga Bowl, closed for 18 months.

523
00:39:56,666 --> 00:39:57,666
It's perfect.

524
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:00,125
- Can I offer some advice?
- No.

525
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:03,333
I mean, economically speaking,
why go after Juvies?

526
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:05,934
Why not let them ripen,
come back when their teeth are valuable?

527
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:09,041
I could come back in September,
but, right now, I'm out of time.

528
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:10,458
And beggars can't be choosers.

529
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:13,083
Plus, you don't want
these things biting people, do you?

530
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:15,416
Wait. Why don't you have time?

531
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:18,333
- Why you ask me so many questions?
- I'm just...

532
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,136
Just stay in the truck
and do your business.

533
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:23,333
Stay in the truck? No, I have to be
with you at all times in the field.

534
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:25,216
- Union rules.
- Other than keeping you alive,

535
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,530
I don't give a shit about rules.

536
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:28,791
No, no, you don't understand. All times.

537
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:31,125
You're gonna stay in this car.
With that in mind, here.

538
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:34,500
- What? No, I don't believe in guns.
- You don't believe in 'em?

539
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:37,583
No, they're amoral. They're
killing machines. They're not for me.

540
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:42,041
When I was a kid, I tried
shooting a squirrel with a BB gun

541
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:43,541
and I just couldn't. All right?

542
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:46,000
I still have nightmares
where I can see his little face

543
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:49,625
making little squirrel noises,
and I still have nightmares about it.

544
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:51,041
Made squirrel noises, huh?

545
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:53,500
- What does a squirrel noise sound like?
- It's like…

546
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:59,750
Whatever! I don't want to talk about it.

547
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,583
Stay in the truck.

548
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:36,750
It's impossible.

549
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:39,541
How the hell can you be here?

550
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:40,791
It's daytime.

551
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,666
You've been a bad boy, Troy.

552
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,958
Did you know that a vampire
cannot live without its fangs?

553
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:05,500
And yet, for whatever reason,
whatever cruel joke from the gods…

554
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,583
They are the one thing
we cannot regenerate.

555
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:17,000
Everything that makes a vampire a predator

556
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:19,541
is in its fangs.

557
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:26,833
Each set is a life
that could have lived a thousand lives.

558
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:32,750
Lives that you had a part in ending.

559
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:41,333
Yet it wasn't always like this, you know?

560
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:47,625
There was a time when you humans,
you worshiped us as gods.

561
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:51,708
Right here in this valley, you built
temples of blood and bone to honor us.

562
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:54,500
And then you turned on us.

563
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:57,916
Well, guess what?

564
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:01,625
I'm gonna take back what's ours,

565
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:05,958
one property at a time.

566
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:12,416
The way I see it,
you have two choices, two doors.

567
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,333
One, you bend the knee
and join me in service and you live.

568
00:43:16,416 --> 00:43:17,625
And two…

569
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:20,333
You don't.

570
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:25,625
All right.
So what the hell do you want? Huh?

571
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:28,791
Who brought you this tooth?

572
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:33,875
A name.

573
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,791
You're so full of shit, lady.

574
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,541
You think you're a god?

575
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:42,958
You're not gods. You're a big mistake.

576
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:47,500
You're a genetic mutation
that would've died out

577
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:51,541
if there hadn't been a stinking hole
for y'all to crawl into.

578
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:53,375
Door number two it is.

579
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:55,916
No. No!

580
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,625
No!

581
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:48,583
Time for the tooth fairy.

582
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:52,041
Ah!

583
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:07,541
Hello, sir.

584
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:11,000
How are we on this fine morning?

585
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,000
Any violations to report?

586
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:14,791
<i>He is certainly heading that way,</i>

587
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:17,500
but nothing verified quite yet.

588
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:18,916
<i>Well, where is he now?</i>

589
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,083
He left me in the car
and went into a bowling alley.

590
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:28,125
You didn't follow him?

591
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:31,583
I thought he was gonna shoot me.
He's very difficult to reason with, sir.

592
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:33,500
<i>Kid! You want your promotion?</i>

593
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:34,875
You want Carol's desk?

594
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:39,208
Then get off your ass,
get in there, and verify those violations.

595
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,166
Ugh! Hair on your nipples!

596
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,083
- Bud?
- Seth!

597
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:51,416
Seth!

598
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,833
Shit.

599
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,583
- Bud!
- Hurry up! Shoot it!

600
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:55,833
I… I don't have my gun!

601
00:45:55,916 --> 00:45:57,666
Give me my shotgun!

602
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,000
I'm just an observer!

603
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:01,416
Your gonna be hors d'œuvre
if you don't give me that gun!

604
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,125
Shit! Shit! Shit!

605
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:08,958
Whoa! I'm sorry!

606
00:46:09,041 --> 00:46:12,001
Next time I tell you, "Gimme that
goddamn gun," you gimme that goddamn gun!

607
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:13,291
- Now duck!
- What?

608
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:14,375
I said duck!

609
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:25,291
You okay?

610
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:33,875
Oh, jeez. That was horrible.

611
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:36,375
These Juvie teeth ain't worth shit,
but get enough of 'em…

612
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:39,125
It's a number game, like you said.
Uh, you okay?

613
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:40,875
What's going on?

614
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:43,916
Oh, come on. No, no, I'm not okay.

615
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,666
- All right? Look at me!
- What?

616
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,833
Vampires just tried to kill me.

617
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:49,375
You put a gun in my face,

618
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:52,208
and now I just pissed
my favorite fucking suit!

619
00:46:52,291 --> 00:46:54,416
Hey, hey. Relax. You did good in there.

620
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,750
You did good in there.

621
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,750
Besides, everybody pisses themselves
the first time.

622
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,875
- Really?
- Yeah.

623
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:04,375
- Did you?
- No, I… No, I didn't. But listen, you did.

624
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:08,375
Here, dry your eyes. Dry your eyes, okay.

625
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:09,875
You know what?

626
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,875
Put it on me. My bad.
We bit off more than we could chew today.

627
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:15,541
So why don't we go home, get some rest.

628
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:18,166
In the morning,
we'll kick some motherfucking ass. Okay?

629
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,083
- Okay.
- All right, come on.

630
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:21,500
Let's get in the car.

631
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:23,875
What the fuck is that?
What'd you eat today?

632
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:25,625
You know what?

633
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,916
Let's have you get in the back.

634
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,166
Don't want you
to get that on my vintage seats.

635
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,208
- What, are you serious?
- Damn right.

636
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:34,458
Come on. Gotta move.

637
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:44,833
Hang your leg out the back
so we can air dry.

638
00:48:04,041 --> 00:48:05,625
Hey. Hey!

639
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:08,455
- You forgot your man purse.
- Wait. That's expens...

640
00:48:10,166 --> 00:48:11,833
You gotta get some of this too.

641
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:14,818
I'm sure you know, Mr. Union Man.
But when vamps are killed,

642
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:18,166
they release a gas that gets on you
that other vamps can sniff out.

643
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:21,083
So you got to get all of that off.
Here, take this.

644
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:24,500
It's my special blend,
like a little, uh, skunk musk, okay?

645
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:26,666
- Now, get that on you, in the shower.
- Oh, Jesus.

646
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,250
On every inch of you, okay?

647
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:30,833
Be extremely careful.
Don't get it in your eyes.

648
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:32,083
And whatever you do…

649
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:35,750
- Don't get it in your butthole.
- What happens in the butthole?

650
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:38,291
I mean, it can't kill you, but…

651
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:39,458
Jesus Christ.

652
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,416
By the way, lock your doors,
don't come out after dark, and, uh…

653
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:45,875
- Guess what?
- What?

654
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:47,083
You're dried up.

655
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:28,708
Oh!

656
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:31,375
- Oh God. It's okay.
- I'm sorry about that.

657
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:32,858
- No, no, me. I got it.
- It's okay.

658
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:34,791
My fault. I couldn't see over my baskets.

659
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:38,375
I got it. This is a…
You a… you a doctor?

660
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:40,000
Uh, nurse, actually.

661
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:42,958
Hope you don't think this is weird,
but you got a lot of scrubs.

662
00:49:43,041 --> 00:49:44,708
Yeah, I mean, I hate doing laundry.

663
00:49:44,791 --> 00:49:46,875
So I kind of just kept buying new ones.

664
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:48,500
- Got out of control.
- Okay.

665
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:51,083
But, hey, new apartment.
Why not start off on the right foot?

666
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:55,208
Yeah. Well, welcome to the building.
I'm right there in 20.

667
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:59,000
- Oh! Well, I'm Heather. I'm in 19.
- Well, I'm Bud 20.

668
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:00,750
Can you help me with that actually?

669
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:01,833
Oh. Yeah.

670
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,291
- Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

671
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,333
- You can just put that down anywhere.
- Sure. Okay.

672
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:11,166
See you've got a retro vibe poppin', huh?

673
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,500
- Dig that.
- Thanks.

674
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:15,500
I wish I had a beer
or something to offer you.

675
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:19,666
Uh, a previous tenant left some ice cream
in the freezer, if you're interested.

676
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,416
No, thanks. I'll take a rain check.

677
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,583
- You sure?
- Yeah. Welcome to the building.

678
00:50:24,166 --> 00:50:25,166
Thank you.

679
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:49,166
Feeling better?

680
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:50,750
Not really.

681
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,833
Got a little bit of that
yellow stuff in my butthole.

682
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:56,375
It was so much worse
than what you even described.

683
00:50:56,458 --> 00:50:57,541
Bet it was.

684
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:05,166
You looking for something?

685
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,916
- Whoa. Hey, that's personal.
- No, no, no.

686
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,375
"Violation code 101, terminated vamps
and didn't report to the union."

687
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:15,541
"Violation code 276, breaking and entering
without union sanctions."

688
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:18,000
- But that did happen.
- Violation. Violation. Violation.

689
00:51:18,083 --> 00:51:21,833
Oh, look at this. "Needs to
reimburse me for six-dollar muffin"?

690
00:51:21,916 --> 00:51:23,416
It's standard union procedure.

691
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,184
- I have to document everything.
- It's not.

692
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:28,208
It's for Seeger, to keep me out the union.
Ain't that great?

693
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:29,958
You almost got me killed yesterday.

694
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:31,916
You almost got yourself killed yesterday.

695
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I told you, stay your punk-ass in the car.
That's why I work by myself.

696
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:38,458
Listen. What? You're gonna die
in the name of kissing your boss's ass?

697
00:51:38,541 --> 00:51:40,416
Well, he didn't give me a choice, okay?

698
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,416
Listen to me, Mr. Union Fellow.

699
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,541
I may not follow all the union rules,
but let me tell you something.

700
00:51:45,625 --> 00:51:48,375
If we went by the book,
we'd both be dead by now.

701
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,833
And you saw that yesterday.

702
00:52:00,416 --> 00:52:03,541
Look. Just give me a couple of days.

703
00:52:06,375 --> 00:52:08,000
Okay, a couple days.

704
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,333
So what's on the agenda today?

705
00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:15,541
Like every day.

706
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,041
Hunting vampires.

707
00:52:25,416 --> 00:52:27,375
Bud, what are we
doing at a pawn shop?

708
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:31,000
This dude's cheap as shit,
but he got goods we need in order to, uh…

709
00:52:31,583 --> 00:52:32,625
What the hell?

710
00:52:39,708 --> 00:52:40,875
Oh Jesus.

711
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:42,333
Shut up. Shut up.

712
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:48,291
Hey, hey.

713
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:51,875
Don't you puke in here!
Don't touch nothing. Don't leave your DNA.

714
00:52:51,958 --> 00:52:53,125
I swallowed it.

715
00:52:56,916 --> 00:52:58,125
Troy.

716
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,208
Troy?

717
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:04,833
Damn it.

718
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,583
Wait, is that…

719
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:11,916
It was.

720
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,875
Oh no.

721
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,416
Who… who does that?

722
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:20,875
All right, we got to move.

723
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:25,916
Wait a minute. Take this.

724
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Ow!

725
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:28,666
Are you kidding me?

726
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,670
- It's not right, okay. Wait...
- Damn right. How you think he feels, huh?

727
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:32,708
Come on, let's go.

728
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,833
Wait. You can't leave.
That's against protocol.

729
00:53:34,916 --> 00:53:36,750
We have to call the union
and wait for them.

730
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:39,833
- Code 233 says any hunter who encounters…
- Code? I don't give a shit.

731
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:42,708
…suspicious civilian death
will be under 30-day suspension...

732
00:53:42,791 --> 00:53:44,541
We don't have 30 days. I don't give fuck!

733
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:46,906
We gotta leave.
There's other vamps around here. Let's go.

734
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:48,916
No, no. I'm calling.

735
00:53:49,541 --> 00:53:51,833
Whoa! We have dead humans here.
We have to report this.

736
00:53:51,916 --> 00:53:54,250
That ain't no dead human!
That's my friend!

737
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:57,666
Listen, I'm not telling you
you cannot report it.

738
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:59,583
I'm just telling you to delay it.

739
00:53:59,666 --> 00:54:02,291
We'll make an anonymous call to the cops,
and, after 24 hours,

740
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:04,291
you can make
your funky little report. Let's go!

741
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:06,708
Why do you care?
What difference does a day make?

742
00:54:06,791 --> 00:54:09,333
I'm gonna lose my family in a day.
That's the difference.

743
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:10,416
What?

744
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:14,625
Look, if I don't score some prices
at union wages by Monday,

745
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:16,625
my wife and my daughter move to Florida.

746
00:54:17,291 --> 00:54:20,583
That means, if you call Seeger,
I'm gonna lose my family.

747
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:25,458
I'm… I'm sorry.

748
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:26,708
Yeah, I bet you are.

749
00:54:29,708 --> 00:54:32,666
So what you're saying
is you kinda need me.

750
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:33,666
But…

751
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,458
No, I didn't… I didn't say I need you.
I didn't say that.

752
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:38,250
- No, I just mean…
- I didn't say that.

753
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:41,083
You told me your secrets.
I'm gonna break protocol for you.

754
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:43,767
- So we're like a team, partners, whatever.
- I didn't say partners.

755
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:45,041
- Crockett and Tubbs.
- No.

756
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:47,458
- Any partnership you find satisfactory.
- Listen.

757
00:54:47,541 --> 00:54:49,166
What I'm saying is this,

758
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:52,500
is as a man,
just give me till the weekend.

759
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:56,708
Yeah, okay. Until the weekend.

760
00:54:57,875 --> 00:54:58,875
Yeah.

761
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,541
Look. What do you want me to do?

762
00:55:04,625 --> 00:55:07,291
If I keep… he's gonna suspect something.

763
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:09,000
Just relax.

764
00:55:39,375 --> 00:55:41,500
I got a tip on this house
from Big J.

765
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:44,541
Why don't you
check the glove box right now?

766
00:55:46,666 --> 00:55:47,708
Yeah.

767
00:55:47,791 --> 00:55:49,916
That's what we're doing right there.

768
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,166
That's what we doing.

769
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:53,208
These… garlic grenades.

770
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:56,000
Pull the pin, garlic and sawdust
comes out, clears the room.

771
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:58,875
I think. Haven't actually had to use it.

772
00:55:58,958 --> 00:56:01,041
But, in theory,
that's what's gonna happen.

773
00:56:01,666 --> 00:56:03,875
An unproven weapon
for my first real vampire fight.

774
00:56:03,958 --> 00:56:05,601
- That's wonderful. Thank you.
- Shit. Shit!

775
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:06,625
What, what?

776
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:08,125
Goddamn Nazarian Brothers.

777
00:56:08,708 --> 00:56:12,000
Wait, the Nazarian brothers.
Oh, they're big-time hunters.

778
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:13,916
Yeah, not bigger than me, though.

779
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,916
Cleared out all of Glendale,
now they're headed west.

780
00:56:21,416 --> 00:56:23,375
Hey, Bud.

781
00:56:23,458 --> 00:56:25,000
I thought I smelled chlorine.

782
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:27,791
Funny. Thought I smelled shit.

783
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:31,000
- Who's the cupcake?
- Seth.

784
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:34,708
I'm his union rep. But you can
call me Cupcake or whatever you prefer.

785
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:37,591
- I'm a big fan, by the way.
- Want to get a selfie for your Instagram?

786
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:41,083
What you guys doing in Simi Valley?

787
00:56:41,166 --> 00:56:42,916
You know what we're doing here, bro.

788
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,875
We let you do the hard part for us,

789
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:47,583
figure out which house
is hiding the goods, then, you know.

790
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:50,125
You got me twisted.
I did the work, but ain't do it for you.

791
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:52,083
Oh, come on, Bud. Think about it.

792
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:56,208
Waste a week waiting for the right moment
that we just might take from you?

793
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:58,041
Or we run up there in force right now.

794
00:56:58,125 --> 00:57:00,666
Sack the place together.
Split the money down the middle.

795
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,541
Well, one, ain't nobody
taking shit from me.

796
00:57:04,791 --> 00:57:05,791
And two…

797
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:14,625
Yeah. It's a good idea.

798
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:18,625
Wanna get a selfie?

799
00:57:19,125 --> 00:57:21,375
Right now? Is that appropriate?

800
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:23,500
- We can wait...
- That's not appropriate at all.

801
00:57:24,916 --> 00:57:27,333
- What's this?
- Keep your neck from getting chewed out.

802
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,958
Take this. Stay behind me,
I keep you alive.

803
00:57:31,041 --> 00:57:33,583
Don't shoot where they are.
Shoot where they're gonna be.

804
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:36,541
You ready? Let's go.

805
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,333
What's the garlic for?

806
00:58:25,416 --> 00:58:27,750
Any vamp gets close to me,
I spit in their eye,

807
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:29,375
melt hole in their fucking head.

808
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:31,333
Bro, you got any more gum?

809
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:38,541
- You always share that with your brother?
- We share everything.

810
00:58:42,166 --> 00:58:44,333
D, you're supposed
to pry that shit open, not smash it.

811
00:58:44,416 --> 00:58:46,333
Hey. Are we inside the house or not, bro?

812
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:49,125
Don't even think about it.

813
00:58:57,291 --> 00:58:58,666
Got him.

814
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,291
- Nice shot, bro.
- Time to get paid.

815
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:05,375
Open up.

816
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:10,666
I told him not to do it.

817
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:15,375
- Really?
- I'm sorry.

818
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:16,750
- Put that gun down.
- Okay.

819
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:18,793
- Take your finger off the trigger.
- Right. Okay.

820
00:59:18,875 --> 00:59:20,083
Just watch my six.

821
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:21,958
Six… Uh…

822
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:42,000
- It's a hive.
- What?

823
00:59:44,458 --> 00:59:45,666
Showtime, bro.

824
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:12,083
Head on out.

825
01:00:13,458 --> 01:00:14,458
Bitch-ass.

826
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:29,083
Keep your head on a swivel, all right?
And stay away from the walls.

827
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:31,458
Oh, shit! Bud!

828
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:36,208
Bud! I don't… What do I do?

829
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:38,416
Ah! You gotta stop wiggling!

830
01:00:39,166 --> 01:00:40,666
Oh no!

831
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:41,833
No!

832
01:00:41,916 --> 01:00:43,916
Oh shit! The gun's broken!

833
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,434
- Take the safety off!
- Help, Bud! My gun's not working.

834
01:00:46,458 --> 01:00:48,833
Oh, come on!

835
01:00:58,708 --> 01:00:59,708
Oh God!

836
01:01:00,291 --> 01:01:01,958
Ah!

837
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:05,166
Ah!

838
01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:20,500
Buckshot mouthwash, baby.

839
01:01:22,666 --> 01:01:25,000
Nice, bro. Yes.

840
01:01:25,083 --> 01:01:26,291
I got six.

841
01:01:26,375 --> 01:01:28,250
You got six, I got five.
I'll catch you up.

842
01:01:36,708 --> 01:01:40,000
Oh shit! Bud, help me!

843
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:46,125
Wait, hold up! Wait, hold on! Ah!

844
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:55,666
Don't let it bite you!

845
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,833
Haircut time, bro.

846
01:02:05,541 --> 01:02:06,666
I'm out!

847
01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:20,458
Ah!

848
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:53,500
Bud, help me! Bud, help!

849
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:55,708
This motherfucker threw me up the stairs?

850
01:02:55,791 --> 01:02:56,791
Ah!

851
01:03:08,208 --> 01:03:09,958
Bro, send one!

852
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:27,416
No good!

853
01:03:27,958 --> 01:03:29,333
Nice work, bro.

854
01:03:29,416 --> 01:03:31,375
Help! Ah! Help me!

855
01:03:42,708 --> 01:03:44,791
Seth, my shotgun!

856
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:05,583
- Big money, baby.
- Huh? This is what I was talking about.

857
01:04:05,666 --> 01:04:07,250
- This was good, yes?
- Very good.

858
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:09,708
What happened to you? You piss your pants?

859
01:04:13,041 --> 01:04:14,166
It's kinda my thing.

860
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,750
- Bro.
- What you doing? What're you doing?

861
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:19,153
Listen, pee-pee pants,
this is man's world, not little boy.

862
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:22,541
Gonna get you a Pamper.
Anyway, listen. Be safe, man. Okay?

863
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:26,375
I'mma take this and put it
towards my baby girl's tuition, you know?

864
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:28,125
That's why I'm out here. You know…

865
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:29,416
Familiar on the run.

866
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,500
I got it.

867
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:37,041
- He's up again. That was vampire.
- I know.

868
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:40,333
Streets done changed. I hear
they got this sunscreen that they put on.

869
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:44,458
It's real thick, and they can now last
out in the sunlight like 15, 20 minutes.

870
01:04:44,541 --> 01:04:46,916
You know it's made
from the shell of desert tortoise.

871
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,875
It's illegal in 40 countries, right, bro?

872
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:51,500
Vampire sunscreen? The Valley?
I don't like the sound of this.

873
01:04:51,583 --> 01:04:53,708
- Hey, wait, this doesn't make sense.
- 'Sup?

874
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:57,041
Okay, that's a Spider, but that's an Uber.

875
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:58,916
Those are Southerns, and…

876
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:02,017
Yeah, that's an Eastern.
You can tell by his fangs in the front.

877
01:05:02,041 --> 01:05:04,833
Ain't Bloods and Crips.
It's the Valley. They cross-pollinate.

878
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:07,500
No, these vamps would never
choose to live together.

879
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:09,291
Ubers are solo-nesters.

880
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:11,875
Spiders co-habit ate,
but never with Easterns and Southerns.

881
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:14,309
- They'd steal their food.
- Listen to this kid. Huh?

882
01:05:14,333 --> 01:05:17,416
This joker reads a few books,
he thinks he knows more than the pros.

883
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,833
No, no, wait, wait, wait.

884
01:05:18,916 --> 01:05:20,416
Kid makes a good point.

885
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,500
But…

886
01:05:22,416 --> 01:05:24,892
But I'm outta time. I gotta go
pick up the little one. Come on.

887
01:05:24,916 --> 01:05:28,666
Pull these fangs. And why don't you
go to the bathroom and dry off your dick.

888
01:05:36,208 --> 01:05:37,208
You okay?

889
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:40,375
I don't know.

890
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:44,666
I just keep thinking about
how all those vampires we just killed

891
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:46,458
used to be regular people.

892
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:48,458
There you go.

893
01:05:48,541 --> 01:05:52,208
The old vampires-are-just-like-us routine.

894
01:05:52,791 --> 01:05:54,000
But they're not, Seth.

895
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:57,750
You know what I see when I see a vamp?
A big old dollar sign.

896
01:05:58,791 --> 01:06:01,250
'Cause all they are
is murderers and liars.

897
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:04,416
It ain't Brad Pitt in a leather jacket
and some blood raves.

898
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:09,041
It's not <i>Eclipse.</i> It's not <i>New Moon.</i>
It's not <i>Breaking Dawn Part One.</i>

899
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:10,500
It ain't like that, all right?

900
01:06:11,083 --> 01:06:13,708
Why do you know the names
to all the specific <i>Twilight </i>films?

901
01:06:13,791 --> 01:06:15,791
What's your gripe
with <i>Breaking Dawn Part 2?</i>

902
01:06:15,875 --> 01:06:18,375
It's the exciting conclusion
of the whole <i>Twilight Saga.</i>

903
01:06:18,958 --> 01:06:20,833
Wha… Have you seen <i>Part 2?</i>

904
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:23,333
Bella has her baby now. It's insane.

905
01:06:23,916 --> 01:06:26,166
- She had the baby?
- Oh, I wish I was you!

906
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:28,875
To experience that the first time.
You're in for a treat.

907
01:06:28,958 --> 01:06:31,708
My daughter hipped me to all that.
I don't get into all that.

908
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,666
But you got something different, Seth.

909
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:36,416
You're tougher than you think you are.

910
01:06:37,958 --> 01:06:38,958
No.

911
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:40,458
I'm serious.

912
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:42,750
You're just saying that
so I don't report you.

913
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:46,291
No, I'm not. You got what it takes.
I'm telling you. You have that instinct.

914
01:06:46,375 --> 01:06:48,166
You could be a real hunter out here.

915
01:06:48,666 --> 01:06:50,166
Telling you right now.

916
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:51,250
Fuck Carol.

917
01:06:52,458 --> 01:06:53,625
Fuck accounting.

918
01:06:54,125 --> 01:06:55,375
You could do this.

919
01:07:06,666 --> 01:07:08,041
- Hey. Hey!
- Hi, Dad!

920
01:07:08,541 --> 01:07:11,083
- Dad? What happened to "Daddy"?
- Little kids say "Daddy."

921
01:07:11,166 --> 01:07:13,125
Oh, is that right? "Dad," huh?

922
01:07:14,791 --> 01:07:16,151
Everything's changing around here.

923
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:20,166
You're late. Again.

924
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:21,708
So what is all this?

925
01:07:21,791 --> 01:07:25,208
Well, I can't actually sell the house
without putting it on the market.

926
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:28,750
Yeah. Last I checked,
it's three days until Monday, isn't it?

927
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:31,166
Come on, Dad.
We're gonna be late to the party.

928
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:34,458
You know, I was thinking,
what if we don't go?

929
01:07:34,541 --> 01:07:37,875
What if we stay here at the house
and eat pizza, some ice cream...

930
01:07:37,958 --> 01:07:41,750
Bud. No. She's been talking about this
all week. You promised.

931
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:45,125
Yeah, well, I just didn't think
it was the right time right now.

932
01:07:45,208 --> 01:07:46,750
What? Okay, give me a reason why.

933
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,750
Right. So, Daddy was just kidding.
He was just being weird.

934
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:55,375
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you guys are going to a party!

935
01:07:55,458 --> 01:07:58,458
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.
- See, Daddy was just being strange.

936
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:00,291
- Strange, yeah.
- Yeah.

937
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:01,625
- Come on.
- Bye.

938
01:08:01,708 --> 01:08:02,833
- Bye, baby.
- Bye.

939
01:08:10,875 --> 01:08:13,166
- Cake time, baby. I'll check on the kids.
- All right.

940
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,625
Hello?

941
01:08:20,708 --> 01:08:22,875
<i>I've been looking for you, Bud.</i>

942
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:24,666
Who is this?

943
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:26,416
<i>Troy spoke so highly of you.</i>

944
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,541
<i>Your name was the last thing
on his lips when he died.</i>

945
01:08:30,041 --> 01:08:32,000
<i>You know how this ends, don't you?</i>

946
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:33,791
You tell me.

947
01:08:33,875 --> 01:08:36,083
<i>With you on your knees in front of me,</i>

948
01:08:36,166 --> 01:08:38,791
<i>begging for the lives
of your wife and your daughter.</i>

949
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:42,750
<i>You took something from me, and now
I'm gonna take everything from you.</i>

950
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:44,625
<i>Enjoy the party.</i>

951
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:56,541
Yay!

952
01:08:56,625 --> 01:08:59,458
Aw. Nice. Ha-ha. That's so nice.

953
01:08:59,541 --> 01:09:02,458
We gotta go, baby.
That's so nice. Happy birthday.

954
01:09:02,541 --> 01:09:04,166
Yeah. Right now.

955
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:06,458
Up, up, up.

956
01:09:06,541 --> 01:09:08,916
Look, buckle yourself in, okay?

957
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,083
Look, in here, all right.
Now let's put your headphones on, okay?

958
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:15,416
Got your iPad right here.
Now listen. Dad's gonna be driving.

959
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:18,583
You might feel a little swerving,
but that's just my special driving.

960
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:51,291
Just pick up, pick up, pick up.

961
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:52,855
<i>Can't talk. Meeting a realtor.</i>

962
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:54,416
- Don't hang up!
<i>- Why? Is Paige okay?</i>

963
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,208
Uh, yeah, she's great, but, uh…

964
01:10:57,291 --> 01:11:00,083
Look, Joss, we're in trouble, okay?
All of us.

965
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:04,666
<i>What? What are you talking about?</i>

966
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:06,250
There's a lot I need to tell you.

967
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:08,916
I know you've had trouble
trusting me in the past.

968
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,750
I know you think I keep things from you,
but right now you gotta trust me.

969
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:15,916
- I don't want to lose either of you.
- <i>Now you're freaking me out.</i>

970
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,208
Pack your bags, be ready to go,
and I will explain everything, okay?

971
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:20,500
<i>A bag?</i>

972
01:11:20,583 --> 01:11:21,791
All right.

973
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:23,791
Hey. You took your headphones off, huh?

974
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:26,750
I already won my race.
Besides, looks like you can use my help.

975
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,750
Uh, you're not wrong on that.

976
01:11:29,833 --> 01:11:31,208
Light!

977
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:37,208
Whoa!

978
01:11:46,208 --> 01:11:47,458
Car!

979
01:11:48,041 --> 01:11:50,000
[skidding

980
01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:51,416
Thank you!

981
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:41,916
All right, big jump. Big jump!

982
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,750
Woo-hoo!

983
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:47,166
There's a guy on the right!

984
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,416
Hold on.

985
01:13:13,666 --> 01:13:15,083
Cover your ears, sweetie.

986
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:41,958
That was awesome.

987
01:13:42,041 --> 01:13:43,916
Yeah? Just don't tell your mother.

988
01:13:55,708 --> 01:13:58,791
Come on. All right. Come on. Let's run.

989
01:13:58,875 --> 01:14:01,291
- Ever heard of Jackie Joyner-Kersee?
- Uh, no.

990
01:14:01,375 --> 01:14:03,041
- I'll show her to you.
- Okay.

991
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:09,125
No! No! No!

992
01:14:09,208 --> 01:14:11,208
No!

993
01:14:13,208 --> 01:14:14,625
No, no, no! Stop!

994
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:18,333
<i>Hola,</i> Bud.

995
01:14:18,416 --> 01:14:21,041
I told you you'd be on your knees
begging for their lives.

996
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:22,250
It's okay. It's okay.

997
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:23,458
So beg.

998
01:14:23,541 --> 01:14:26,250
- Go to hell.
- Oh, your <i>com padre </i>said the same thing.

999
01:14:27,833 --> 01:14:30,125
Oh shit. Baby, I'm sorry.

1000
01:14:30,208 --> 01:14:32,375
I'm sorry for this, Joss. Are you okay?

1001
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:33,458
Yeah.

1002
01:14:33,958 --> 01:14:35,083
What is happening, Bud?

1003
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:38,958
I could try to explain it right now,
but it's not gonna make any sense.

1004
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:40,750
- But...
- But what?

1005
01:14:42,375 --> 01:14:44,250
I'm not exactly a pool cleaner.

1006
01:14:45,875 --> 01:14:47,208
Well, then what are you?

1007
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,250
I…

1008
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:52,000
Hunt vampires.

1009
01:14:53,916 --> 01:14:56,166
- What?
- Yeah. I hunt vampires.

1010
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:59,416
- Vampires?
- Yeah. That's what I do.

1011
01:14:59,916 --> 01:15:01,166
- Vampires?
- Yeah.

1012
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:06,416
Okay, so all of the lies, all of
the late-night calls, all of the locks…

1013
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:07,541
Come on, man.

1014
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:10,416
The reason I'm separated
from the man I love is vampires? Ow!

1015
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,000
Stop choking her like that!

1016
01:15:12,583 --> 01:15:15,375
Come on, Bud. We said
we were gonna be honest with each other.

1017
01:15:15,458 --> 01:15:16,458
We are.

1018
01:15:18,125 --> 01:15:20,017
- I know. Don't even look at it.
- Oh my God!

1019
01:15:20,041 --> 01:15:21,916
Listen…

1020
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,166
I wanted to tell you,
I just didn't know how.

1021
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:27,666
Okay. Okay, so…

1022
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:30,541
Uh, what do you want?

1023
01:15:30,625 --> 01:15:31,708
What do I want?

1024
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:34,625
You and your daughter.

1025
01:15:35,375 --> 01:15:38,291
- They're not a part of this!
- <i>Pendejo, </i>you made them a part of it!

1026
01:15:41,916 --> 01:15:42,750
Don't touch me!

1027
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:43,750
Don't touch her!

1028
01:15:43,833 --> 01:15:45,083
I'm not afraid of you.

1029
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:47,375
Such a brave <i>muñeca.</i>

1030
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:48,291
Take them.

1031
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:50,333
- No! No!
- No, don't touch her!

1032
01:15:50,416 --> 01:15:52,767
- Leave her alone! Get your hands off her!
- Don't touch her!

1033
01:15:52,791 --> 01:15:54,041
I'll come get you!

1034
01:15:54,125 --> 01:15:55,416
Daddy!

1035
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,458
- I'mma fix all of this. I love y'all!
<i>- Cálmate,</i> Bud.

1036
01:15:58,541 --> 01:16:02,166
A new day is dawning, and at least
your little girl's gonna be a part of it.

1037
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:03,541
Get off of me.

1038
01:16:06,666 --> 01:16:08,458
First, I'm gonna turn her,

1039
01:16:08,541 --> 01:16:11,583
and then I'm gonna watch
as she drinks your wife.

1040
01:16:13,583 --> 01:16:15,083
I wish you could be there to see it,

1041
01:16:15,166 --> 01:16:17,875
but I'm afraid
someone's having you for dinner.

1042
01:16:23,541 --> 01:16:24,916
<i>Buen provecho.</i>

1043
01:16:37,916 --> 01:16:39,083
<i>Daddy!</i>

1044
01:16:48,166 --> 01:16:49,166
Oh, I'm alive.

1045
01:16:51,333 --> 01:16:52,666
Oh, Bud.

1046
01:16:53,458 --> 01:16:54,458
Oh!

1047
01:16:54,916 --> 01:16:56,375
Oh, I feel weird.

1048
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:58,208
Yeah, I bet… I bet you do.

1049
01:16:58,291 --> 01:16:59,708
What happened to me?

1050
01:16:59,791 --> 01:17:02,916
Just some bullshit. You know how shit go.

1051
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,125
But, uh…

1052
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:07,416
You probably wanna… check your teeth.

1053
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:08,583
Check my teeth?

1054
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:11,041
Yeah, just check them.
There's a mirror over there.

1055
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:12,125
Oh…

1056
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,458
Oh! Oh no!

1057
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:18,750
Oh no. Oh, that's not good.

1058
01:17:19,916 --> 01:17:23,208
- What! That was totally involuntary.
- It's like a hiccup, probably.

1059
01:17:23,291 --> 01:17:26,458
I'm sorry, man, it was all my fault.

1060
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:27,541
How you feel?

1061
01:17:28,166 --> 01:17:30,916
Pretty horrified
about the fact that I'm a vampire.

1062
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,625
- Right. Right.
- But also like…

1063
01:17:32,708 --> 01:17:34,708
- I don't know, kind of amazing.
- Yeah, like...

1064
01:17:34,791 --> 01:17:37,541
Like my blood, it just…
it feels like it's on fire...

1065
01:17:37,625 --> 01:17:39,916
Like you had, like,
a lot of energy drinks.

1066
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,083
Oh, I can smell everything!

1067
01:17:43,166 --> 01:17:46,083
Oh God, did I shit myself this time?

1068
01:17:46,166 --> 01:17:47,500
No, no, no, you look fine.

1069
01:17:47,583 --> 01:17:49,541
- Is there like a mark?
- No, you look good.

1070
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:50,958
Everything looks great.

1071
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:52,791
Listen, let's just take it easy.

1072
01:17:52,875 --> 01:17:54,795
We're gonna work this out.

1073
01:17:54,833 --> 01:17:56,041
Oh wow.

1074
01:17:56,125 --> 01:17:59,208
Mainly I just… Whoa, I just feel

1075
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:00,708
hungry!

1076
01:18:05,625 --> 01:18:07,416
Goddamn it, Seth.

1077
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:11,541
I'm sorry, kid.

1078
01:18:11,625 --> 01:18:13,708
I'm actually gonna miss you, man,
you know?

1079
01:18:13,791 --> 01:18:16,041
It's crazy how
you get attached to someone.

1080
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:17,250
Oh, shit.

1081
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:21,291
Bud?

1082
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:22,750
Huh?

1083
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:25,750
You cut my head off.
I thought we were friends.

1084
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:27,958
I… You rushed me.

1085
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:30,541
It's just reaction. That's what I do.

1086
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:34,291
It's in my blood. It's like…
You ever see Tyson? He…

1087
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,875
You don't walk up on Tyson, either.

1088
01:18:37,375 --> 01:18:39,000
Friendship is complicated, huh?

1089
01:18:40,416 --> 01:18:42,750
Yeah, friendships are complicated.

1090
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:46,125
All right, wait. Follow my voice.
Left, there. Yep, okay.

1091
01:18:46,208 --> 01:18:48,458
Easy. No. Okay, easy, easy.

1092
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:51,083
Okay, here we go.

1093
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:52,166
The fuck?

1094
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:53,916
Okay, gentle.

1095
01:18:54,916 --> 01:18:56,083
Gentle.

1096
01:18:58,458 --> 01:18:59,708
Huh. Still fits.

1097
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:02,083
Wha…

1098
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:07,333
Oh, it's been quite the week.

1099
01:19:07,416 --> 01:19:09,666
Yeah, it has. You good?

1100
01:19:10,708 --> 01:19:12,375
- How do I look?
- You look all right.

1101
01:19:12,458 --> 01:19:14,000
- You feel all right?
- You swear?

1102
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:16,083
Yeah.

1103
01:19:16,166 --> 01:19:17,416
- Hey!
- Sorry. Just kidding.

1104
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:19,500
- Okay. All right.
- Too soon. Too soon. All right.

1105
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:23,666
Hey, I'm sorry I tried to eat you.

1106
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:25,916
How 'bout we not report this
to Seeger until Monday?

1107
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,625
Seeger, shit. Oh, what?
You don't think he's gonna notice?

1108
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:33,083
What, am I just supposed to
wear turtlenecks from now on?

1109
01:19:33,666 --> 01:19:37,000
I mean, I do look good in a T-neck,
but that's not sustainable.

1110
01:19:38,416 --> 01:19:40,916
- Wait. Where are we going?
- Going to get my family back.

1111
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,333
I have to stop at my place
and get some information.

1112
01:19:43,916 --> 01:19:46,583
What's going on with your neck?
Is it repairing itself?

1113
01:19:47,375 --> 01:19:48,708
I actually think it is.

1114
01:19:48,791 --> 01:19:50,916
Just be careful.
Don't go over any speed bumps.

1115
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,000
Damn. Damn.

1116
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:56,750
My bad.

1117
01:20:02,958 --> 01:20:05,375
You have a driving problem.
You know that, right?

1118
01:20:05,458 --> 01:20:07,166
I gotta go to apartment 19.

1119
01:20:07,916 --> 01:20:09,041
I'll be back in five.

1120
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:18,708
Heather, you just moved in.
Leaving so soon?

1121
01:20:18,791 --> 01:20:20,875
Bud, just listen to me.

1122
01:20:22,916 --> 01:20:24,458
Look, we need to talk.

1123
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:26,958
Talk? Vampires kidnapped my family.
You want to talk?

1124
01:20:27,041 --> 01:20:29,166
- I didn't have a choice.
- I don't give a rat's ass.

1125
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:42,708
This is stupid, Bud.
Let me at least explain.

1126
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:49,916
Okay, listen.

1127
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,541
Because of you, my family got kidnapped,
and my friend is dead.

1128
01:20:54,125 --> 01:20:55,000
Or undead.

1129
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:56,833
So I don't want no problems, I just…

1130
01:20:59,666 --> 01:21:01,000
That's what she does, Bud.

1131
01:21:01,083 --> 01:21:03,708
She turns people against their will.

1132
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:07,208
I wasn't even a familiar.
She just… just did this to me.

1133
01:21:07,291 --> 01:21:09,171
You think I want
to work for a monster like her?

1134
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:10,583
Then why do you?

1135
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:17,166
- She's my maker, okay?
- What?

1136
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:18,250
And an Uber Vamp.

1137
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:20,083
Look, she forced me to get close to you.

1138
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:22,286
She wanted to get back at you
for what you did to her.

1139
01:21:22,333 --> 01:21:23,333
What you talking about?

1140
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:27,916
She just…
She just wanted to know how to hurt you.

1141
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Why?

1142
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:35,833
So you just gonna
light your finger on fire, huh?

1143
01:21:44,416 --> 01:21:46,291
You killed a vampire Monday, didn't you?

1144
01:21:46,375 --> 01:21:48,666
- Sweet old lady?
- Not so sweet, actually.

1145
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:50,416
That was Audrey's daughter.

1146
01:21:52,208 --> 01:21:54,750
Daughter? How?

1147
01:21:54,833 --> 01:21:57,750
When she came over, she had
a little girl she had to leave behind.

1148
01:21:57,833 --> 01:22:01,458
So by the time they went back,
found her, and turned her, she was old.

1149
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:03,833
- And I killed her.
- And you killed her.

1150
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:05,791
And now they got Paige and Jocelyn.

1151
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:06,958
I'm sorry.

1152
01:22:07,041 --> 01:22:10,500
Hey, Bud. I don't feel so good.

1153
01:22:11,041 --> 01:22:13,250
Could you hold my head for a little?

1154
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:17,791
Holy shit.

1155
01:22:23,166 --> 01:22:26,583
You're walking on sacred ground.
You should be honored.

1156
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:28,791
Where are you taking us?

1157
01:22:28,875 --> 01:22:31,375
- Why, are you frightened?
- No.

1158
01:22:31,458 --> 01:22:32,291
You should be.

1159
01:22:32,375 --> 01:22:34,541
Well, then you don't know me
that well, bitch. Ah!

1160
01:22:36,625 --> 01:22:38,166
Why are you doing this?

1161
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:39,541
Paige, don't talk to her.

1162
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:40,916
She has a right to know.

1163
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:43,791
You don't get to decide...

1164
01:22:46,916 --> 01:22:49,916
I had a daughter once, feisty like you.

1165
01:22:50,583 --> 01:22:52,458
I wanted to make a better world for her,

1166
01:22:52,541 --> 01:22:55,375
a world where
she could be free from hiding.

1167
01:22:56,083 --> 01:22:58,375
But your father took that away from me.

1168
01:22:58,458 --> 01:23:01,708
But now, you see,
it's only fair I take you away from him.

1169
01:23:01,791 --> 01:23:04,541
If you hurt her, I'll kill you.

1170
01:23:04,625 --> 01:23:06,291
But I'm already dead.

1171
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:10,083
I'm not gonna hurt her, Ms. Jablonski.

1172
01:23:10,166 --> 01:23:12,541
I'm gonna make sure
no one can ever hurt her again.

1173
01:23:13,041 --> 01:23:14,875
You should thank me.

1174
01:23:14,958 --> 01:23:16,416
A war is coming,

1175
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:19,250
and your little girl's
gonna be on the winning side.

1176
01:23:20,583 --> 01:23:21,625
- No!
- Paige!

1177
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:24,916
Let me go.

1178
01:23:25,625 --> 01:23:26,625
No. No!

1179
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:36,166
Come on.

1180
01:23:39,083 --> 01:23:40,916
Seth, hold your head still.

1181
01:23:41,666 --> 01:23:45,541
Looks like they turned him with Uber blood
so he'll be unpredictable for a while.

1182
01:23:45,625 --> 01:23:47,583
He'll get under control eventually.

1183
01:23:50,166 --> 01:23:51,000
Here.

1184
01:23:51,083 --> 01:23:53,208
No, I'm pescatarian.

1185
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:54,291
Come on.

1186
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:58,458
Mm. Mmm!

1187
01:23:59,083 --> 01:24:01,916
You hunters are always
complaining about LA running dry.

1188
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,916
That's what Audrey's trying to change.

1189
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,750
It's, like, sweet but a little tangy.

1190
01:24:05,833 --> 01:24:08,750
That's nice.
Oh yeah, get inside of me.

1191
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:12,250
She uses her cover as a realtor
to buy properties all over the Valley

1192
01:24:12,333 --> 01:24:14,166
and move vamps
back in amongst the rest of us.

1193
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:16,125
Within a year, all vamp activity in LA

1194
01:24:16,208 --> 01:24:18,625
will be traceable
to her sitting at the top.

1195
01:24:18,708 --> 01:24:20,250
Not if I get to her first.

1196
01:24:21,041 --> 01:24:21,958
I'll lead the way.

1197
01:24:22,041 --> 01:24:24,958
- All right, I'm coming too.
- No, no, no. No. Hell no, Seth.

1198
01:24:25,041 --> 01:24:27,375
You got too much energy now.
You fresh off some blood.

1199
01:24:27,458 --> 01:24:30,000
I don't want you to switch up on me,
try to bite my kidneys out.

1200
01:24:30,083 --> 01:24:31,541
No, Bud, listen. They tortured me.

1201
01:24:31,625 --> 01:24:34,583
Okay, they drank my blood.
They cut my head off.

1202
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:39,041
I guess technically you cut my head off,
but they turned me into this, okay?

1203
01:24:39,125 --> 01:24:41,083
- I want to help take her down.
- Okay.

1204
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:44,083
We'll get you changed,
head back to my spot, and we'll gear up.

1205
01:24:44,666 --> 01:24:46,333
- Oh, right now?
- Yeah, right now.

1206
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:47,333
What? It's dark out.

1207
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:48,958
That's a suicide mission.

1208
01:24:50,291 --> 01:24:52,333
Welcome to the motherfucking night shift.

1209
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:22,083
Oh shit!

1210
01:25:22,166 --> 01:25:25,000
- Ah! Oh, they got me!
- Look, Seth, calm down!

1211
01:25:26,375 --> 01:25:28,517
They're expecting humans.
It's lead, it can't hurt you.

1212
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:32,500
- Really?
- Yes. But, hey, let it make you mad.

1213
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,458
Ah!

1214
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:33,250
You okay?

1215
01:26:35,791 --> 01:26:38,125
This one actually hurts. Shit. Ah! Ah!

1216
01:26:48,916 --> 01:26:50,875
Bud, what do we do? We're surrounded.

1217
01:27:12,791 --> 01:27:14,125
Black Cowboy.

1218
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,166
Get down.

1219
01:27:40,208 --> 01:27:42,000
Oh shit.

1220
01:27:42,791 --> 01:27:44,125
How the hell you get here?

1221
01:27:44,625 --> 01:27:45,625
The snowflake.

1222
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:47,666
I might have texted him.

1223
01:27:48,250 --> 01:27:50,583
- Welcome to the fucking union, brother.
- Thank you.

1224
01:27:50,666 --> 01:27:53,000
- Hey, hey, if you don't get your ass off...
- Oh. Sorry.

1225
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:54,083
- This way.
- Sorry.

1226
01:27:54,125 --> 01:27:55,166
Come on, Big J.

1227
01:27:55,250 --> 01:27:56,250
After you.

1228
01:28:05,875 --> 01:28:09,333
Bud, in the back, look for the staircase.
That's the entrance to her tunnel.

1229
01:28:09,416 --> 01:28:11,250
Keep going down and you'll find her.

1230
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:13,791
There's a faster way down,
but you wouldn't survive it.

1231
01:28:13,875 --> 01:28:16,958
We survive everything. See me
fighting a bear, you pour honey on me.

1232
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:18,583
You two go ahead. We'll catch up.

1233
01:28:23,666 --> 01:28:25,583
Come on. Let's get cracking.

1234
01:28:56,458 --> 01:28:58,000
Just like old times.

1235
01:28:58,083 --> 01:28:59,250
I'm out.

1236
01:29:01,666 --> 01:29:03,166
Look at this shit here. Jackpot.

1237
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:04,750
Man, look at all this gear.

1238
01:29:06,833 --> 01:29:07,833
Okay.

1239
01:29:09,458 --> 01:29:13,041
Ugh. Shit, look at this.
All this sunscreen.

1240
01:29:13,125 --> 01:29:16,208
Vamps runnin' around in the day.
She could take over the Valley.

1241
01:29:19,333 --> 01:29:20,791
Handle him, J!

1242
01:29:21,375 --> 01:29:22,583
Okay.

1243
01:29:22,666 --> 01:29:24,291
Oh shit.

1244
01:29:24,375 --> 01:29:27,041
I see you. He didn't know, did he?

1245
01:29:27,125 --> 01:29:28,125
He didn't know.

1246
01:29:29,916 --> 01:29:31,250
Whoo! Get him, J.

1247
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:35,458
Stay down, fool.

1248
01:29:35,541 --> 01:29:38,208
Yo. You did that
without even stretching, huh?

1249
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:41,875
That was my weak leg.

1250
01:29:42,458 --> 01:29:44,625
See all this? Huh?

1251
01:29:45,333 --> 01:29:46,333
All these guns?

1252
01:29:47,625 --> 01:29:49,585
Check it out.
Silver-tipped wooden bullets.

1253
01:29:49,666 --> 01:29:50,791
Vampire killers.

1254
01:29:50,875 --> 01:29:52,083
What's that about?

1255
01:29:53,208 --> 01:29:54,375
Is she El Jefe?

1256
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:56,458
Nah. El Jefe is bigger than this, brother.

1257
01:29:56,541 --> 01:29:59,666
But, either way,
that bitch got an ass-whooping coming.

1258
01:30:00,958 --> 01:30:01,958
Yeah.

1259
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,833
Yeah, they down here.

1260
01:30:18,125 --> 01:30:19,291
Let's get cracking.

1261
01:30:19,375 --> 01:30:20,791
Just like old times.

1262
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,166
He's coming.

1263
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:29,041
I can smell him.

1264
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:33,833
I don't know how all this works,
but I know my husband,

1265
01:30:34,333 --> 01:30:36,000
and he's gonna murder you.

1266
01:30:36,083 --> 01:30:38,666
- Ex-husband.
- See, now you're just being a bitch.

1267
01:30:42,875 --> 01:30:43,875
Paige.

1268
01:30:52,541 --> 01:30:55,541
- This place ain't creepy at all.
- Tell me about it.

1269
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:57,500
Here we go.

1270
01:31:29,166 --> 01:31:30,166
Bud!

1271
01:31:38,583 --> 01:31:41,083
Jablonski…

1272
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:56,666
John!

1273
01:32:13,375 --> 01:32:15,041
That's how we do, baby.

1274
01:32:15,125 --> 01:32:18,083
You know how we do.
We bag 'em, and we tag 'em.

1275
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:19,375
That's how we get it done.

1276
01:32:19,458 --> 01:32:21,666
What's going on with you, Chief?

1277
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:24,291
Ain't nothing going on.
Ain't nothing wrong with me, man.

1278
01:32:24,375 --> 01:32:27,208
- You all right?
- Shit. You know they can't fuck with me.

1279
01:32:27,291 --> 01:32:28,750
Okay, but why you leaning like that?

1280
01:32:28,833 --> 01:32:31,041
We been battle tested.
This don't mean nothing.

1281
01:32:31,125 --> 01:32:32,925
- All right.
- Nothing but a flesh wound, dog.

1282
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,583
Okay. Still, it don't look too good.
Come on, let's get up out of here.

1283
01:32:37,916 --> 01:32:41,166
Come on. We ain't got much time.
Gotta get you out of here. Come on, man.

1284
01:32:44,666 --> 01:32:45,666
Come on!

1285
01:32:46,666 --> 01:32:49,346
- Big John, what the hell is you doing?
- I'm saving your Black ass.

1286
01:32:49,416 --> 01:32:50,500
What are you talking about?

1287
01:32:50,583 --> 01:32:52,500
Go get your family right now. I got this.

1288
01:32:52,583 --> 01:32:55,000
- We can't do it like this.
- You know I work alone.

1289
01:32:56,083 --> 01:32:57,666
- You crazy motherfucker.
- Go.

1290
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:59,416
- You better stay alive.
- Go!

1291
01:33:00,583 --> 01:33:02,291
I'll be here waiting for you.

1292
01:33:07,666 --> 01:33:09,375
All right, motherfuckers, come on!

1293
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:53,000
West side for life.

1294
01:34:00,291 --> 01:34:01,333
John…

1295
01:34:07,916 --> 01:34:11,916
I'm not supposed to kill you yet,
but you've been a real pain in the ass,

1296
01:34:12,583 --> 01:34:13,875
so give me one good reason.

1297
01:34:13,958 --> 01:34:14,958
Burn in hell.

1298
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,125
Good enough.

1299
01:34:34,625 --> 01:34:37,375
- You're working on that landing, huh?
- No, I planned it like that.

1300
01:34:37,458 --> 01:34:38,583
Go, we've got him.

1301
01:35:01,875 --> 01:35:04,458
No!

1302
01:35:07,375 --> 01:35:08,500
Paige! Stay back.

1303
01:35:09,958 --> 01:35:10,958
Daddy!

1304
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,250
- Joss, you okay?
- Yeah.

1305
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:16,083
All right. I'll let you go.

1306
01:35:16,166 --> 01:35:18,750
A life for a life
or whatever the hell you have.

1307
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:24,708
You took my daughter, Jablonski.

1308
01:35:25,375 --> 01:35:27,541
- I'm just returning the favor.
- No.

1309
01:35:28,875 --> 01:35:30,875
- Mommy!
- Baby!

1310
01:35:33,333 --> 01:35:34,625
What do you think, <i>muñeca?</i>

1311
01:35:34,708 --> 01:35:36,750
I'm gonna kill your daddy,

1312
01:35:36,833 --> 01:35:39,208
then I'm gonna make you
drink your mean old mommy,

1313
01:35:39,291 --> 01:35:42,958
and then I'm gonna be
your new, improved mommy.

1314
01:35:43,708 --> 01:35:45,101
How does that sound?

1315
01:35:45,125 --> 01:35:46,125
I hate you!

1316
01:35:46,625 --> 01:35:48,291
That's not very nice.

1317
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:49,833
I hate you too.

1318
01:36:01,333 --> 01:36:02,666
Daddy!

1319
01:36:09,041 --> 01:36:10,541
Ah.

1320
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:38,041
Ah!

1321
01:36:41,666 --> 01:36:43,416
I should've just got another job.

1322
01:36:45,125 --> 01:36:46,750
Ah!

1323
01:36:46,833 --> 01:36:49,166
- Baby, get up!
- Come on, Daddy, get up!

1324
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:50,375
Baby, I'm trying.

1325
01:36:50,458 --> 01:36:52,291
- Try harder.
- Oh, okay.

1326
01:37:17,250 --> 01:37:18,750
That's what you get.

1327
01:37:21,291 --> 01:37:22,500
No!

1328
01:37:23,875 --> 01:37:24,875
Mommy!

1329
01:37:34,333 --> 01:37:35,583
Pull!

1330
01:38:01,625 --> 01:38:04,708
Wood to the heart, silver to the neck.

1331
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:35,333
No!

1332
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:52,583
The best.

1333
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:58,583
Y'all good?

1334
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,041
Works every time.

1335
01:39:03,125 --> 01:39:04,125
Let's go.

1336
01:39:09,375 --> 01:39:10,708
Come on, babe. Let's go.

1337
01:39:12,666 --> 01:39:13,916
All right.

1338
01:39:15,666 --> 01:39:17,375
- Hey. Where's Seth?
- Hey.

1339
01:39:17,458 --> 01:39:20,000
- Whoa!
- No, no, no. Babe, babe, no.

1340
01:39:20,083 --> 01:39:21,500
They're the good vampires.

1341
01:39:21,583 --> 01:39:24,250
That's my girl Heather.
That's my guy Seth.

1342
01:39:24,333 --> 01:39:25,583
- Hey.
- Hey.

1343
01:39:25,666 --> 01:39:26,666
Whose arm is that?

1344
01:39:27,375 --> 01:39:28,791
Oh. Sorry.

1345
01:39:29,375 --> 01:39:32,333
But, Bud… got my first pair of fangs.

1346
01:39:32,416 --> 01:39:33,416
Whoa.

1347
01:39:34,291 --> 01:39:35,583
That's big money right there.

1348
01:39:35,666 --> 01:39:36,791
- Guess what?
- What's that?

1349
01:39:36,875 --> 01:39:38,333
I didn't pee myself this time.

1350
01:39:38,916 --> 01:39:41,208
- Get out.
- Vampires don't pee or poop.

1351
01:39:41,291 --> 01:39:42,666
Nah, they don't.

1352
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:46,958
- Please let me have this little victory.
- Of course you can. C'mon. Let's go.

1353
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:51,500
Do they really not pee or poop?

1354
01:39:51,583 --> 01:39:54,708
- Does that mean they're full of shit?
- Language!

1355
01:40:02,583 --> 01:40:03,791
Big John.

1356
01:40:03,875 --> 01:40:05,250
I'll miss you, baby.

1357
01:40:13,333 --> 01:40:14,166
Oh, no.

1358
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:15,333
Go ahead.

1359
01:40:16,083 --> 01:40:17,708
It's got good energy in that.

1360
01:40:21,166 --> 01:40:22,166
All right.

1361
01:40:22,916 --> 01:40:25,458
We were hiding right over there.
Right over there.

1362
01:40:25,541 --> 01:40:26,875
Jablonski!

1363
01:40:27,833 --> 01:40:30,708
Seeger? What the hell you doing,
walking all fast like that?

1364
01:40:31,666 --> 01:40:32,916
New shoe boots on.

1365
01:40:33,708 --> 01:40:36,791
And you. What are you, sick?

1366
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,416
- Uh, pink eye.
- What?

1367
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,416
It's when poo particles get in your eye.

1368
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:43,583
Where's Big John?

1369
01:40:47,125 --> 01:40:49,458
Oh goddamn it!

1370
01:40:50,875 --> 01:40:51,958
I did you a solid.

1371
01:40:52,041 --> 01:40:55,791
But now you have
graciously returned the favor,

1372
01:40:55,875 --> 01:40:58,416
because after the shit
you pulled here tonight,

1373
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:00,833
I'll never have to deal with you again.

1374
01:41:01,416 --> 01:41:02,958
For starters,

1375
01:41:03,041 --> 01:41:07,583
flagrantly violating code 682,
operating outside of your shift.

1376
01:41:07,666 --> 01:41:09,041
Actually, sir, if I may.

1377
01:41:09,791 --> 01:41:12,916
Code 741 states that,
"If a hunter is in a 911 situation,

1378
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,875
he may circumvent normal operating hours

1379
01:41:14,958 --> 01:41:17,833
so long as he notifies the union
before entering," which he did.

1380
01:41:17,916 --> 01:41:19,875
Thank you. Thank you for that.

1381
01:41:19,958 --> 01:41:23,625
There's also code 584,
unlawful termination of familiars

1382
01:41:23,708 --> 01:41:25,541
without prior authorization.

1383
01:41:25,625 --> 01:41:28,375
Yes, sir, that is correct,
but Section 4 states,

1384
01:41:28,458 --> 01:41:31,208
"When fired on, a hunter is
lawfully allowed to return fire,"

1385
01:41:31,291 --> 01:41:32,625
which is what happened here.

1386
01:41:33,375 --> 01:41:37,333
Code 424, "A union Hunter
must make all reasonable efforts

1387
01:41:37,416 --> 01:41:41,375
to limit collateral damage to property
while engaging in a hunt."

1388
01:41:41,458 --> 01:41:42,333
Boom!

1389
01:41:42,416 --> 01:41:44,416
- Sir, code 42...
- I got this.

1390
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:49,166
Code 424 was rescinded by
the national office in January.

1391
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:50,791
Boom. Boom.

1392
01:41:51,291 --> 01:41:53,708
- Someone's been reading.
- Saw it in the newsletter.

1393
01:41:53,791 --> 01:41:55,791
Yeah. I see what's going on here.

1394
01:41:55,875 --> 01:41:56,875
Uh-huh.

1395
01:41:57,375 --> 01:41:58,375
Loopholes.

1396
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:01,458
Think you're smarter than me?

1397
01:42:01,958 --> 01:42:04,875
Then you can probably spell "traitor."

1398
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:06,833
Sure.

1399
01:42:06,916 --> 01:42:09,666
T-R-A-I-T-O-R. What was the point of that?

1400
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:15,916
Carol's keeping her fucking desk.

1401
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,916
Good! She can have it.

1402
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,375
I'm a field man now!
Mowing down vamps with my best friend Bud.

1403
01:42:25,125 --> 01:42:27,833
- That felt good.
- You did that.

1404
01:42:27,916 --> 01:42:30,125
Wait. Shit. What are you
gonna do about the money?

1405
01:42:30,208 --> 01:42:32,000
Oh, I'm good.

1406
01:42:32,083 --> 01:42:33,750
Think I'm gonna be all right.

1407
01:42:33,833 --> 01:42:34,833
And, uh…

1408
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,083
Fuck Carol.

1409
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:39,708
Hey, should I drink Carol?

1410
01:42:39,791 --> 01:42:41,291
No, no, that's a lot of cholesterol.

1411
01:42:41,375 --> 01:42:42,375
Right, okay.

1412
01:42:42,416 --> 01:42:45,041
I won't go out of my way,
but if, like, there's a chance encounter

1413
01:42:45,125 --> 01:42:46,500
outside her house at night or…

1414
01:42:46,583 --> 01:42:48,000
- Yeah. Later.
- See you, guys!

1415
01:42:48,083 --> 01:42:49,416
- Bye.
- See you, guys.

1416
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
What about us?

1417
01:42:53,583 --> 01:42:54,666
What about us?

1418
01:42:55,166 --> 01:42:57,666
I was thinking,
what if we tried this whole, you know,

1419
01:42:57,750 --> 01:42:59,500
stay on the same groove type thing.

1420
01:42:59,583 --> 01:43:01,708
You know, me cooking breakfast. You know?

1421
01:43:01,791 --> 01:43:05,458
How about we take it
one day at a time, but no more lies.

1422
01:43:05,541 --> 01:43:08,666
After what we've seen tonight,
there is no reason to lie.

1423
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:12,541
So I ask you a question,
and you give me a straight answer.

1424
01:43:12,625 --> 01:43:15,250
I can live under those terms, you know.

1425
01:43:15,333 --> 01:43:16,333
Okay.

1426
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:18,625
Yeah, I don't think we're there yet.

1427
01:43:18,708 --> 01:43:21,000
Mm-hmm. You just gonna leave me like this?

1428
01:43:25,791 --> 01:43:28,333
Mmm. Jump back, want to kiss myself.

1429
01:43:29,125 --> 01:43:31,166
I'm gonna be a vampire hunter too.

1430
01:43:31,666 --> 01:43:32,541
Uh…

1431
01:43:32,625 --> 01:43:33,625
- No.
- No.

1432
01:43:34,958 --> 01:43:38,375
- Daddy, why do you call me Pickle?
- Because that's what you are, baby.

1433
01:43:38,458 --> 01:43:41,333
Sometimes you're a sweet pickle,
sometimes you're a sour pickle,

1434
01:43:41,416 --> 01:43:43,333
and sometimes you're a salty pickle.

1435
01:43:43,416 --> 01:43:44,833
I love you, Daddy.

1436
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,750
That's what I love about LA.

1437
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:06,083
All the damn vampires.

1437
01:44:07,305 --> 01:45:07,486
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
