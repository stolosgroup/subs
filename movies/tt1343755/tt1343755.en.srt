RABBIT WITHOUT EARS 2

3
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,424
Hello, Anna Gotzlowski.

4
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,555
I am a strong, independent woman,
and l know exactly what I want.

5
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,516
l have no self-confidence problems.

6
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,685
I am totally into my independence.

7
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:29,314
And my boyfriend, Ludo, of course.

8
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,024
What a man!

9
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:35,279
Women are crazy about him,
and he is constantly being hit on.

10
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,322
I am so happy for him.

11
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,994
Actually, did l mention
how incredible Ludo is in bed?

12
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,207
Oral sex is my absolute favorite.

13
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,543
Right to the end.

14
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,212
But Ludo tastes incredibly good,

15
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,173
and so ...

16
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,551
good ... so ...

17
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,511
so good ...

18
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,390
good ...

19
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,518
Hey Ludo,

20
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:10,522
because you always have those
dirty Angelina Jolie fantasies,

21
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,358
I have a little surprise for you ...

22
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,846
Super! Tell me
which part of "go buy toilet paper"

23
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,265
you didn't understand!

24
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,769
I mean, seriously.
l asked you four days in a row

25
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:53,023
to pick up toilet paper on the way home.
That's not too much to ask.

26
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,109
And what is all this?

27
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,072
How can this not bother you?
It stinks!

28
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,742
Eww! What do you think will happen?
The mould will grow legs

29
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,703
and drag itself to the hamper?

30
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:11,124
Listen, did you leave
any dirt on the soccer field?

31
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,795
Man, I am so sick
of cleaning up after you.

32
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,632
You aren't a child anymore!
Did you take the bottles back?

33
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,302
I bet you didn't.
- Yes. - You did?

34
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,138
Yes.
- That is cool.

35
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:29,685
You told me to.
- You guys drank so much.

36
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,689
l hope that  Moritz
didn't puke in the driveway for once.

37
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,149
He doesn't do it on purpose.

38
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:41,655
Come, get up.
- Please. Can't you go to work for me?

39
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,992
Very funny.
You have the forest project group now.

40
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:53,208
Today's topic is the forest, right?
l thought we could approach it

41
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:57,629
in a playful way.
Do you want to play a game? - Yes.

42
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,174
What's the game called?
- Hibernation.

43
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,636
Hibernation?
- Yes! l'm the fat, lazy bear,

44
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,889
and you are the bear's children.
All summer long,

45
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,851
we explored the whole forest

46
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:17,024
so now we're really, really tired
and really happy to go to bed!

47
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,401
Ahh ... nice ...

48
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,739
That game sucks.
- Shh, don't wake the bears!

49
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,533
You mean "the bear."

50
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:35,459
What sits on a tree
and looks like a sguirrel? - No idea.

51
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,586
A sguirrel!

52
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,508
Where did you hear that?
- l made it up!

53
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:47,721
That's not how it works!
You have to lie down now to play!

54
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,431
Zappzarapp!

55
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,771
Yes ...

56
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,025
The little bear children
have finally stopped yapping.

57
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,778
They will stop giggling

58
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,406
and are really happy
about their hibernation.

59
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,868
Breathe deeply ...

60
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,414
and smell the fresh forest air.

61
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,461
And breathe deeply ...

62
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,552
You're supposed to close your eyes.

63
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,807
But l can't sleep
when the big bear snores like that.

64
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:54,621
Eww, that's gross!
- l have an idea.

65
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:11,680
So now the bear knows
what the forest really smells like.

66
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,851
What are you all doing?
- We're playing hibernation.

67
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,228
Hibernation?

68
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,481
Do you want to know what happens
when spring comes?

69
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:22,899
Yes!

70
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,235
Alright.

71
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,697
Spring is here!

72
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,045
Done!

73
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,886
What is that? - A jaundiced,
lop-eared, pot-bellied pig.

74
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,434
It's the new friend
of the rabbit without ears.

75
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,853
What is the friend's name?

76
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,023
Jaundicedlopearedpotbelliedpig.

77
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,067
Twoearchicken.

78
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,153
Twoearchicken?

79
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,780
Twoearchicken?
- That's right.

80
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,284
But chickens don't have ears.
- They do now.

81
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,495
What do you think?
- Cool.

82
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,040
What do you think?
- Sweet.

83
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:24,044
But why does that chicken have ears?
- Because Ludo can't sew?

84
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,507
lt has ears
because it wished for them so hard.

85
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,967
But why?
- Why what?

86
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:35,680
Why did it wish for ears?
- Because it really wanted to fly.

87
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:39,768
It can fly with its ears?
- Yes,

88
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,646
but only at wind force four or five.

89
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,358
And only with the north-westerly.
lt stands there,

90
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,860
and waits for the wind from behind.

91
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,405
The wind goes under its ears,
and it lifts off like a plane.

92
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:57,285
lt flies around the world,
and it can see everything below.

93
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:01,748
It's been to Turkey,
the Antarctic, the Luneburger Heide.

94
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,417
lt was even behind the moon.

95
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:09,130
lt grew ears just because
it wished for them really hard?

96
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,590
Yes.

97
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:14,052
lf you wish for something
and really believe

98
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,389
that it will come true,
then it does.

99
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,819
The ear story was really sweet.
- Yeah? Thanks. Can we go?

100
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:35,365
Yes. l just have to put on my shoes.
- You said that before.

101
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,953
The new ones or these?

102
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,122
Um ... those.

103
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,043
Don't you like the other ones?
- l didn't say that.

104
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:51,214
But you like these better?
- They're both nice.

105
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,717
But you told me to wear these.

106
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,178
You asked, I answered.
lt was a suggestion.

107
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,432
A suggestion. Aha.
But they're so uncomfortable.

108
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,310
So wear the others for God's sake!
- They're even worse.

109
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:08,398
So why did you buy them?
- On sale but not in my size.

110
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,444
You bought shoes that don't fit?
- They fit me.

111
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,488
l mean, I can fit into them.

112
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,825
I'd really like to buy some nice shoes,
but we're always broke.

113
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,537
Can we go now, please?
- I want you to like how l look.

114
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,124
Sweetie, you look good in those shoes,
and in those shoes,

115
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:30,128
and even when you are barefoot!
- Your problem is that you can't decide.

116
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:34,007
The place will be closing soon.
- So you chose the first ones?

117
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,969
Which ones? - The ones you said first.
- l have had enough.

118
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:42,599
You know what? We'll stay home
and watch TV. What's on?

119
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:47,312
No way. We're partying today.
- The party'll be over soon.

120
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,733
Okay, I'll take these.
- Finally, yay.

121
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:56,738
But these don't go with my dress.
I'll change. Only need a sec ...

122
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,409
Hey!

123
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,622
You guys Tiki-Taki?
- What?

124
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,124
Are you Tiki-Taki? I wanted to meet you.

125
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,884
Where did you get that line?
- I made that one up. It's an original.

126
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,720
Congratulations!
- Thanks!

127
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,555
Yeah, yeah ...

128
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,605
My dress is so tight. It's pinching me.

129
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,942
Why did you put it on?
- Because it goes with the shoes.

130
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,237
l have to go to the toilet.

131
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,419
Need help?

132
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,673
Could you close my dress?
It's a bit tight.

133
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,093
Just one sec.
- Thanks.

134
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,930
Can you pull your tummy in?

135
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,852
Oops ...
- Oh, no. - Sorry.

136
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,231
Now l can't go back out there.
I look like a burst sausage.

137
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:17,360
Don't stress about it.
Happened to me, too, when l was chubby.

138
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:21,364
l had to squeeze into dresses
that were too tight. It's no fun.

139
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,493
Ah!

140
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,540
What is it?
- New shoes really suck for me.

141
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,043
Really?
lt's just the opposite for me.

142
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:52,145
You want a drink?
- Sex on the Beach. - Don't do them.

143
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:56,483
Then l'd like an orgasm.
- So would l.

144
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,235
Why not fix yourself one?
- Sorry?

145
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:04,199
Should I call security?
- l just wanted a cocktail.

146
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,534
This is the champagne bar.

147
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:10,497
Ah. Now l see that, too ...

148
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,251
Can I have your number anyway?
- She's not giving him her number?

149
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,005
She is.

150
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,721
You're cool. - That's the
Flirt Academy's number. Give it a try.

151
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,599
Anna?
- Freezing cold.

152
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,644
Marie!

153
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:43,279
I have a girlfriend now.
- That's super. - Right?

154
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,449
l have a boyfriend, too.
- Yeah? - But he's a retard.

155
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:51,538
Do you remember how
you did me on that haystack?

156
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,039
Oh yeah ...

157
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:57,919
Oh Ludo.
I never had better sex than with you.

158
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,465
Where do you live now?
- ln Berlin. - In Berlin?

159
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:07,679
Yes. Still have my number?
- No. - So put it in there.

160
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,432
Go.
- Zero, one, seven, three,

161
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,227
five, eight, four, four, four,

162
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,771
sex, sex,

163
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,357
sex.
- Really?

164
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,402
That makes sense.
- Ouch!

165
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,364
Sorry.

166
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,659
I apologize. Sorry, I didn't see that.

167
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,830
Ludo, l'd like to go.
- You said we were partying today.

168
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,625
My dress exploded, my feet hurt,
l waited for an hour in the toilet.

169
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,503
l have had enough, okay?
And l'm a little tired.

170
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:43,882
Are you coming?

171
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,145
Is something wrong?
- What could be wrong?

172
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,314
You're acting funny.

173
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,902
Who was that?
- Who?

174
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,113
The one you were sitting with.

175
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,408
The one you made a scene about?

176
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,290
She's a really old friend.
- l didn't make a scene.

177
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,629
You did. And you stepped on her hand
on purpose. - I did not.

178
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,090
Sure you did.
- l did not. - You did.

179
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:30,678
Why on earth would l step on her hand?
l thought she was really nice.

180
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,889
Really?
- Yes.

181
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,432
Great!

182
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,853
She'd be a great girlfriend for you.

183
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,106
You guys will get along great.

184
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,651
She's not one of those bitches, y'know?

185
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,779
She's up for anything.

186
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,323
I can believe that.

187
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,328
I love you.
- I love you, too.

188
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,462
We can call her tomorrow

189
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,383
and ask her if she wants
to have breakfast with us.

190
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,638
Did you buy milk?

191
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:02,729
Where is the milk?
-  Man, I am still asleep.

192
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,501
What is all the noise?

193
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,132
What's this?

194
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,267
l asked you what this is.
- A bottle.

195
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,686
Aha.
- Aha what?

196
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,981
And what is it doing here?
- l don't know. Ask it.

197
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,360
It almost slit me open just now.
- lt's plastic ...

198
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:56,240
Pure luck, my friend.
- Come cuddle. lt's the weekend.

199
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,869
Ludo,
I've told you to take them in for weeks.

200
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:04,457
Yesterday you lied
about it without batting an eye.

201
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,336
Okay, so l'll get up early
on the weekend

202
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,756
and do it to make you happy.

203
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,802
lt's no fun asking you for help.
- l am doing it!

204
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,721
But I don't want it this way.
- Huh?

205
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,600
Take a look at yourself.
I want you to be happy to help.

206
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,854
So it's not enough that I take them in,
I have to be happy to take them in?

207
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:31,400
That's exactly right.
- But l'm not happy, nobody would be!

208
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,236
Especially not on the weekend!

209
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,489
You've had four weeks to do it!
l see it this way:

210
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:41,119
If you love and respect someone,
you're happy to do stuff you don't like.

211
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:45,957
And you don't lie to them.
- If l tell you l'm happy to take

212
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:50,461
a million bottles in, I'd be lying!
- Lying was fine for you before!

213
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,589
l didn't lie to you!
- You told me you'd done it!

214
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,717
I didn't lie. I meant to do it,

215
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,345
but the timeframe I wanted to do it in

216
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,974
got pushed back a little,
and l forgot to tell you.

217
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,435
So it wasn't a lie.
- Yes, that's what l'm saying.

218
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:12,400
Sure. My man doesn't lie, he just forgets
to mention changes in his timeframe.

219
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,111
"Dear Anna, l've been with
a new girlfriend the last two years.

220
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,948
Unfortunately I forgot to tell you
our relationship timeframe changed."

221
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,576
Oh my Lord ...

222
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,584
Hello?
- Ludo.

223
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,004
Hey. - No, it's a really bad time.
l am, let's say,

224
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:37,800
in the middle of a meeting.
- What? - I'll call you back, okay?

225
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,679
Are you done?
- I have ... - That is so typical.

226
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,765
I am making an effort
and analyzing our relationship,

227
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,603
and the first chance you get,
you escape the situation.

228
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,813
Hello? My phone rang!

229
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,315
Okay.

230
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:58,321
You said you did
something I asked you to do.

231
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,240
Look at me when l'm talking.

232
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,450
Come on!

233
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,330
But you didn't really do it,
and you're just hoping

234
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:12,084
that I won't find out.
I find out, call you a liar,

235
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,421
and you say no.
What does this say about our trust?

236
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,759
Then if l go look
at the whole situation,

237
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,470
I have to ask what else isn't true.

238
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,388
Right? ln the end,

239
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:29,310
you never do anything l ask
and pretend things are all different.

240
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:34,398
You only ever do what you want without
even a hint of a guilty conscience.

241
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,151
Now analyze all of this and tell me

242
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,237
what it all really means.

243
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,367
What?
- This is about the whole thing.

244
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,203
The bottles are only the microcosm
for the macrocosm.

245
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:51,540
It isn't that hard to understand, is it?
- Yes.

246
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,087
Yes?
- Yes, you are right.

247
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,839
How do you mean?

248
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,512
I think ... l think what you are saying

249
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,014
sounds logical and plausible,

250
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,684
and you are simply right.

251
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,773
You said what?
Hello? l don't understand at all.

252
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,693
l don't either.
She must be getting her period.

253
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,028
l didn't mean what Anna said!

254
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:25,116
I mean you. You can't tell
a woman she's right when she's wrong!

255
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,953
It's self-betrayal! Where is your pride?
- Pride?

256
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:33,916
Listen to me. When a woman
is on your case and goes so far

257
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:37,670
that she forgets her own point
and starts saying:

258
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:42,466
"You always ... You never ..."
Then you're in deep shit.

259
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:47,013
They bring up all your mistakes
from the last thousand years,

260
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,932
remember everything
you have long forgotten

261
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,270
or was done by some other guy.
And when that gets started,

262
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,856
you can never win.

263
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,818
Do I have no pride? Maybe.
Am l betraying myself? Who cares?

264
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:04,405
I just want some peace.
That's what they call psychology.

265
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:12,997
How stupid does he think l am?
- He meant well. It's a reflex.

266
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:17,501
Confronted with an angry woman,
their ears ring. They want that to stop.

267
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,797
lt's like with a dog whistle,
a very uncomfortable sound for dogs.

268
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:26,010
Once Ludo got an ear infection
in the middle of a fight. Suddenly,

269
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,721
he couldn't hear a thing.
- No way!

270
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:33,309
Or when he has to fix something,
he invites Moritz over and tells him

271
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:37,521
how great being a handyman is,
till Moritz begs him to do it.

272
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:43,277
He's not stupid. - Ludo is
the laziest guy ever. Lazy and cunning.

273
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:47,990
At least he cooks. - He always
makes a mess cooking "pasta a la Ludo"

274
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:51,202
and then there's his rule:
"The cook never cleans up."

275
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:54,580
The cook has his little servant
cleaning up after him.

276
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,666
He has an excuse
for everything. He won't

277
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,462
wash the wooden floor
because the water ruins it.

278
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,092
Standing in line at the store drives him
crazy, and he never ever flirts.

279
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,054
He just talks to old friends
who happen to have big tits.

280
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,516
I know that kind of old friend.
- Just once, l'd like to see

281
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,895
a guy talk for five minutes
to a fat, ugly old friend.

282
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,481
Is  Marie really good looking?
- Kinda cheap.

283
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,150
She looks great.
- No. Cheap, like I said.

284
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:28,155
Fine.  Maybe in a really cheap way,
she looks kinda great.

285
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,283
Did she text him yet?
- l don't look at his phone.

286
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:35,246
Why not?
- I don't spy on my boyfriend.

287
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,708
Okay, so you don't.
But I'll tell you what happens.

288
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:45,131
She starts telling him about you,
"She's so sweet, Ludo!"

289
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,800
Blah, blah, blah ...
So he won't be suspicious.

290
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:52,263
So if you say something mean,
you look like a jealous bitch.

291
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,099
When her trick has worked,
then she goes for it.

292
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,935
Writes him sweet text messages.
Tells him what a great guy he is.

293
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:02,398
And that he'd make any woman happy.
Then she starts with the old stories.

294
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,276
"Remember when we fucked there?"

295
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:09,155
"And remember how crazy we were,
how relaxed and free."

296
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,450
And to underline it all,
she permanently shakes

297
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,952
her barely covered tits.

298
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,580
When you get upset, he thinks of her.

299
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:24,378
You're the bitchy girlfriend, and he'll
pine for that crazy little fuck-bunny.

300
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,923
l still won't spy on him.
- Jesus!

301
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:33,137
lf he leaves his stuff lying around,
maybe he wants you to spy.

302
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,852
If it's on the floor,
you can't help it, if you see something.

303
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,229
l thought I shouldn't clean up.
- Hey!

304
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:47,276
Not dirty socks and food scraps.
Credit card bills and cell phones, yes.

305
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,237
Silly girl.

306
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:21,435
They all wash just fine.
It's all pure cotton.

307
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:26,190
Um, I was thinking I wanted to try
something in silk maybe?

308
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:30,152
l see what you're getting at.
- Red or black or something.

309
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,488
Something cheeky.
- Yes.

310
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:36,158
A-cup?
- No, B. Or maybe C ...

311
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,662
Okay ...

312
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,377
Try this one.
- Thanks.

313
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,926
Amazing!

314
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,470
Yes?

315
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,641
But l think it's a bit tight up here.

316
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,311
I thought so ... double-D.

317
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,771
Thanks.

318
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,527
Oh ...

319
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,153
And?

320
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:17,199
Well ... I would say

321
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:21,036
on your hips and tummy,
it's a bit too tight.

322
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:24,248
And up top,
you don't really fill it up.

323
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:29,003
So you mean, l am flat-chested, but
luckily I have a big butt. - Come on.

324
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,339
l have a neat trick for you.

325
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:42,850
A secret weapon for those of us
not as well-endowed by nature.

326
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,395
Aha ...

327
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,990
Hey, Anna!
-  Marie ... - Hey.

328
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,075
What a coincidence!

329
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:04,830
lt is extremely rare
that anyone is built like you

330
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:08,626
and has a D-cup.
One could be envious.

331
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:13,255
Am I eat like a horse,
but I just can't put on any weight.

332
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,592
Someone even called me anorexic once.

333
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,220
l was totally hurt.
Be happy that you are so normal.

334
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:25,809
Imagine that. There are people
who fight bullshit like world hunger

335
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:29,521
while people like you
have real problems.

336
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,857
I'll get you the bigger inserts.

337
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:38,489
Um, no thanks. l don't need any!
- l'd give them a try.

338
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:43,410
Ludo's always liked big breasts
as long as I've known him.

339
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:47,206
As his live-in girlfriend,
I know better, and I've known Ludo

340
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,667
since kindergarten.
- Oh right.

341
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,295
He told me how he tortured you.
- Four eyes!

342
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,673
But only because you told on him.

343
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,176
Stupid asshole!
I'll teII your big sister!

344
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,804
I didn't tell on him. We were friends.

345
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:06,433
You were the tattle tale
with the glasses and monster retainer.

346
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,645
l had a slight overbite.
- Ludo tells it differently.

347
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,231
Funny he never talked about you.

348
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,858
Maybe you guys have trust issues?

349
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,569
Or you weren't important enough.

350
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:24,076
I wouldn't be so sure!
- I'd love to stay and chat, but ...

351
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:27,246
but ... um ...
- Yes?

352
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,167
This is ridiculous.

353
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,044
Your breasts!

354
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,549
This is still tight up here, hm?

355
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,643
Can't you put your things away?

356
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,147
ln real time?
Before your timeframe changes again!

357
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:57,818
Man! Shoes on the table.
Butter on your jacket.

358
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,257
Oops, fell down.

359
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:32,019
"Hey, sex god! Looking forward
to seeing you! Kiss,  Marie."

360
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,271
Oh shit.

361
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,237
Something wrong?
- No, nothing?

362
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,490
I am outta here.

363
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,495
Where are you going? We need groceries.
- l have to meet someone.

364
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,747
Who?
-  Marie.

365
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:56,293
Why are you going out with Marie?
- She needs a man's advice.

366
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,547
A man's advice?
- Yes. Relationship problems.

367
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,967
Are you that stupid goose's
relationship therapist?

368
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,804
What now?
You told me she's nice.

369
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,265
Ludo, the woman is awful.
- You don't know her.

370
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,978
l do. We just had a deep conversation.
- Where?

371
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,774
At the bakery.
- Aha.

372
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,068
Really. She's a stupid bitch.

373
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:25,656
She is calculating and empty
with silicone tits. - No, they're real.

374
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,993
No silicone there.
- I don't care. l can't stand her.

375
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,996
Pity you say that.
She really likes you.

376
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,374
She likes me?
- Yes.

377
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:40,045
How dumb are you?
- What? When l said you liked her,

378
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,922
she was thrilled.

379
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:46,885
Are you jealous?
- Sorry. No.

380
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,388
You are jealous.

381
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,516
Right.

382
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,727
Fine. Want to come along?

383
00:30:56,646 --> 00:31:01,692
Are you mental? l meant what l say,
but you have to make your own mistakes.

384
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,409
I am outta here.

385
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,912
Bye.
- Have fun, sex god.

386
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,166
Did you look in my phone?

387
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,004
l can't believe it ...

388
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:29,970
I only ... it was on the floor ...
l was cleaning up ...

389
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,098
Anna, that's fucked up.

390
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,188
Stupid ...

391
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,275
I forgot to tell you before

392
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,528
that you totally
could have brought your girlfriend.

393
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:51,033
Should we call her?
- No, we were fighting.

394
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,660
Really? What about?

395
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,456
She looked in my phone.

396
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,792
That sucks.

397
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,837
Such a breach of trust.

398
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:08,175
Oh God! Did she read my message?

399
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,470
Should I call her and explain?

400
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,972
No, forget about it.

401
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,521
lt hurts so bad.

402
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,985
You're mad.
- Sure.

403
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,071
Don't be mad.
- Why not?

404
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:33,617
You are a dream man.
You could have anyone, and she knows it.

405
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,913
lt can't be easy for her.
- Are you Anna's lawyer today?

406
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:41,959
Ludo, don't be stupid.
I just want to be fair.

407
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:46,672
She is insecure and afraid of losing you.
- Bullshit.

408
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,800
Do you love her?
- Sure I love her.

409
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,637
Sure?
- I want to spend my life with her.

410
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:58,058
Wow ... That sounds nice.

411
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,559
Right?

412
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,605
Are you faithful?
- 1 00 percent. - Ludo,

413
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,315
l know you.

414
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,527
People change.

415
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,911
What are you doing?
- No?

416
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,666
Old feelings are bubbling up.
- Nope..

417
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,672
Not here either?
- No.

418
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,215
And ...

419
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,262
... if l do this?

420
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:40,225
Sorry to disappoint. No movement there.
- Ah.

421
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:44,021
You got a lead pipe in your pants,
or are you just happy to see me?

422
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:48,066
Please take your foot away,
or l'll stand up and go.

423
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,528
You've gotten so closed-minded.

424
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,532
l think you're getting old.

425
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,914
What advice did you need
about your retard boyfriend? - None.

426
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,042
I just broke up with him.

427
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,337
Yeah? You don't seem very upset.

428
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,007
l told you he was a retard.

429
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,010
Anyway, l'm sitting here with you.

430
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,596
But not for long.

431
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,432
I have to go now.
- Already?

432
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:25,062
I have to go grocery shopping.
- Ah, groceries.

433
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,356
l see.

434
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,360
Look! Spare ribs.
You like them so much.

435
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,948
l can't, not organic.
- Let's forget that for today.

436
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,577
I want to spoil you today.
Today is Ludo Decker Day.

437
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:44,122
We'll buy anything your heart desires.
Refined sugar,

438
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:49,127
white flour, meat from factory farming,
eggs from laying batteries.

439
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,006
Hey, look! Who am I?

440
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,508
"Ludo,

441
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,511
you have a super nice girlfriend."

442
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,012
Very funny.

443
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:03,934
It's not fair you're still mad.
l explained it to you.

444
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:09,106
I'm not dumb. No one can accidentally
unlock a phone with their foot

445
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,567
and also accidentally
open the inbox with their big toe.

446
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:16,154
That's what happened.
- You didn't have to read it.

447
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:19,241
Or was that your foot, too?
- Alright. l read it on purpose.

448
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:24,162
At least you're admitting it.
That's just how we didn't want to be.

449
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,457
We wanted to trust each other
and give ourselves free space.

450
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:31,920
This is the start of a thousand things
that don't belong in a loving,

451
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,965
trusting relationship.
You said we shouldn't be

452
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:40,720
accountable to each other but live our
own lives while loving each other, too.

453
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,266
It is completely fucked up
that you're starting with this. Really.

454
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,357
I understand what you are saying.
Wait a second.

455
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:57,195
You are right somehow. lt's all true.
But think about why l did it.

456
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:00,490
You don't trust me and want control?
- I don't want that.

457
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,451
lt's just that
you're not so thoughtful anymore.

458
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,538
I was in the toilet for an hour
while you're flirting with this chick!

459
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,166
So this is about  Marie?

460
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,836
No, it's that
you take me for granted now.

461
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:17,132
You don't look at me anymore
and think how lovable and exciting I am.

462
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,759
l look at you and think just that!

463
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,220
Not now.
- You're behind me.

464
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,639
You are too fast again!
- l'm walking normally.

465
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,642
You always go too fast,
now, when we go out for dinner ...

466
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,313
You always have to be first.
At first you watched where l was.

467
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:36,276
You paid attention and asked
if I was feeling okay. But now,

468
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:39,446
there's no woman
who gets more doors in her face.

469
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,992
This is actually about something else.
You don't trust me.

470
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,287
And I don't see why it's my fault
that you look in my phone.

471
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:51,791
You just want to distract me.
Now you don't have anything to say!

472
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,839
That's exactly what l meant.

473
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:02,344
My name is Dr. Ephraim Eisenberger.
I am well over 50,

474
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:06,640
am losing my hair,
and l have a very small penis.

475
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,225
Last night,

476
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,269
I slept with this woman.

477
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,190
Bravo!

478
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:23,323
And you can, too!
Welcome to the Flirt Academy.

479
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,747
You. Pale young man there.

480
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,583
What is your name?
- Me? - No, back there.

481
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,294
You. Yes, you.

482
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,089
Um ...  Mo ...  Moritz.

483
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,591
Moritz.

484
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,094
Come up here and flirt with me.

485
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,347
Come on. No one will bite you.

486
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,182
Come on.

487
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,643
Stop.

488
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,103
Not like that.

489
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,984
Each step you take
should be a sweet promise.

490
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:03,196
Convince me to sleep with you, okay?

491
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,711
No, l don't want to sleep with you.

492
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,755
Pity, um ...

493
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,175
May I ask why?

494
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,806
Come up here.

495
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,601
You see your dream woman in a bar.

496
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:38,189
White teeth, big breasts,
Gucci bag. What do you say?

497
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,943
Um, nice handbag?

498
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,656
Come over here.

499
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:52,078
Are you parents terrorists?
- Um ... no ...

500
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,705
Funny ...

501
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:57,042
l could have sworn.
You are so hot.

502
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,878
As hot as a bomb.

503
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:09,554
Good one.
That is ... wow. That's good.

504
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:14,017
Yes, l know.
- Bomb, yes ... - For the tough ones:

505
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:17,270
Listen, l am an author,

506
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:21,316
and I'm writing a telephone book.

507
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,777
Can l have your telephone number?

508
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:41,836
What? - My God, how l love
Anna Gotzlowski and find her exciting.

509
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,173
You are sweet.

510
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:50,345
What smells so good?
- Come in. We have a visitor.

511
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,104
Hi!

512
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,901
You must be Lupo.
- Ludo!

513
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,154
Or that.
- Who are you, if I may ask?

514
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,449
I'm Ralf.

515
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,577
What Ralf?
- Ralf and I studied together.

516
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,538
He was in Africa for a long time

517
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,833
and founded his own aid agency.

518
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,215
ls that my apron?
- Ralf is cooking for us today.

519
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:31,261
African. - I wanted to make "pasta a la
Ludo." - We always eat that.

520
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,890
What can l do? Couscous or meat?
- Nothing. Have a seat

521
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,601
and drink wine with Lupo.

522
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:42,647
You are nice, but you can't cook.
- Yes I can.

523
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:45,608
Anna is a great cook.
- Really? You never like it.

524
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:51,698
l do like it. l'm just not able
to show it. - Lupo? - Ludo!

525
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,367
Oops. Now l'll remember:

526
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:58,830
Ludo ... Anyway, it's really nice
that l can stay here a few days.

527
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,999
Sorry?
- He's stopping over

528
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:05,211
before going back to Africa.
-  May I?

529
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:10,508
I'll take care of the house,
and you can relax! - Great!

530
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,308
C'mere, please?
- Sure.

531
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,812
l don't want to see that guy
in my kitchen every night.

532
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,608
Ludo, this is our place.
Your friends are always welcome.

533
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:30,111
Where is he supposed to sleep?
- On the couch. Where else?

534
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,406
Hello? We don't even have doors.
Did you think of that?

535
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,783
You can manage a couple of days.

536
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,288
Do you have fresh coriander?
- l'll get it for you.

537
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:44,209
Stop complaining and help.
Go make up the couch.

538
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:47,128
I won't make his bed!
- You want him in our bed?

539
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:51,424
You see? I thought so.
Come on, dinner's ready.

540
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,135
Oh, that smells great!

541
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,815
I almost broke off my tooth.

542
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,529
Where are the sheets?

543
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:16,574
Don't you know?
- Would l ask otherwise?

544
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:20,620
In the closet.
- In which closet?

545
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,915
Ludo, in the closet you're standing in.

546
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,633
Try some.

547
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,273
Can't I at least ...
No, let me stir this.

548
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,194
A sex list. l can't believe it.

549
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,366
Name: Ludo Decker.

550
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,830
Cock size: fits.

551
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,333
Sex: super.

552
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,715
Ralf Schmidt ...
- Ludo, dinner's ready!

553
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,468
Cock size: mini salami.

554
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:03,723
Sex: worst ever. This is great!

555
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,065
Ralf Berger.

556
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,234
Cock size: Eiffel Tower.

557
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,696
Lupo! Come on! lt's getting cold.

558
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,615
Sex: incredible.

559
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,479
It tastes super.

560
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,363
What are you writing
your thesis about, Ralf?

561
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:04,742
What is your last name?
- Ludo, l just asked a guestion.

562
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:08,663
Muller,  Meier, Schmidt ...?
- Ludo ...

563
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,209
When we have such a nice visitor,
can't I ask him his name?

564
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,753
This is Ralf. He told you.

565
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,715
What are you writing about?
Developmental aid?

566
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,926
The history of genital shaving.

567
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:28,516
Fuckin' A.
A thesis about the Brazilian!

568
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:33,312
Must be anthropologically interesting.
- Absolutely.

569
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:37,233
Did you know it's been practiced
for thousands of years?

570
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:40,111
It goes back to ancient Egypt. 4000 B.C.

571
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,031
How do they know?
- Tomb paintings.

572
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,201
l'd have thought
it was 80s US stuff or something.

573
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:51,247
No, no, it is
a constant throughout human history.

574
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:54,792
In Muslim harems
there were eunuchs trained

575
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:57,170
to remove the concubines' pubic hair.

576
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,547
Why did they do it back then?

577
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,674
There were various reasons.

578
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:05,178
One important aspect
was hygiene, of course.

579
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:09,223
No hairs, no creepy crawlies. Logical.

580
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:12,769
The other important aspect
was aesthetic.

581
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:16,230
ln ancient Rome,
pleasure girls could ask twice as much

582
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:20,735
as soon as they were shaved.
A naked mound was the ideal of beauty.

583
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:24,989
Sure. If l order a schnitzel
I wouldn't want fur on it. - Fur!

584
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,992
Good word. Shaving down there

585
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,204
was important for survival
among primitive peoples.

586
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,791
They shaved to differentiate
themselves from their prey.

587
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:39,545
lf I go on a bear hunt with a big bush,
I'll be the first one

588
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,298
to be shot.
- Smart comment, Mr. Decker!

589
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:47,094
l am ambivalent about it.

590
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:51,390
In female pubic shaving
l see a compulsion to conform

591
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,310
and relinquish female individuality

592
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,979
in our pornographic society.

593
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:01,943
The woman who refuses to
conform, to be smoothed out,

594
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:05,404
is subject to enormous
repression by her environment.

595
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,991
So pubic shaving ends up being
copied without question

596
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,785
only to be liked.

597
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:15,373
The fact that they follow and repeat
the dominant gender-power-logic,

598
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,792
proves that pubic shaving

599
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:22,338
is a significant part in
chauvinistic, patriarchal repression.

600
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,423
Holy moly.

601
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:29,762
Furthermore, there is
a widely accepted theory

602
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:35,017
that says a hairless mons veneris
is so attractive to men because a woman

603
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:40,857
looks young and that attracts men
with pedophile tendencies.

604
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,154
What kind of shit is that?

605
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:51,742
I personally find a woman in her
natural condition the most beautiful.

606
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,370
When she really looks like a woman.

607
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,623
Are you telling me
you like to dive into the bush land?

608
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,251
lf the woman has nice hair.

609
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,926
Whew. I never thought about it.

610
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,470
I think l'll let mine grow back.
- You're crazy.

611
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,307
lf you grow a bush,
l'm growing a beard.

612
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,476
That's totally different.
- It is not. - Then do it.

613
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:21,564
l will. - l'll let my leg hair grow.
Starting now. - Go ahead!

614
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,901
I will. And my armpit hair.
- That is really

615
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:29,322
awful.
- I'm tired. Can we go to sleep now?

616
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,199
l'll do the washing up in the morning.

617
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,911
Ah ... Berger.
- Huh?

618
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:36,579
Ralf Berger.

619
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:40,249
You wanted to know my name, Lupo.

620
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,209
Good night, Lupo.

621
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,632
He is so nice.

622
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:51,594
Hey!

623
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,054
Lupo!

624
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:03,814
Lupo, wake up. Good morning, Lupo.

625
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,073
Do you have Ajax?

626
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,534
Ajax for the sink?

627
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,373
I'll go have a look myself.

628
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,083
Morning.

629
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,964
Ralf, that's great!

630
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,591
The kitchen looks perfect!

631
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:34,428
You are amazing. Thanks.
-  My pleasure.

632
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:38,391
Could I come see the kindergarten?

633
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:42,561
Sure, of course.
- l'd love to meet your merry band.

634
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,399
And Ludo can sleep in, right Ludo?
- Hm?

635
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,401
Great.

636
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:12,299
Yes, right. I see.

637
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:19,390
The postman sure is handsome.

638
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,434
He's not that good looking.

639
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,644
He looks like Brad Pitt.

640
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:26,188
The most handsome postman in the world.

641
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,816
You don't know them all.

642
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:33,654
If you pay us, we'll tell you
what he always says to Anna.

643
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:35,656
Okay, how much?

644
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,493
1 000 euros.
- You are crazy.

645
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,579
Forget it then.

646
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,915
l'll give you all lollipops.

647
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,375
Okay.

648
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:48,961
What does he always say to Anna?

649
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:52,048
"Morning,  Ms. Gotzlowski,
here's your mail."

650
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:08,064
Jambo, dear children!
That's Swahili for hello!

651
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,816
Jambo.

652
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,403
Jambo, buana.
awarigami mousuri suri,

653
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:15,821
sana.

654
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,782
Alright, let's get started.

655
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:24,371
Kasperle, Kasperle.
Tell me about Africa.

656
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,790
Super!

657
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:30,044
You're a curious fella ...
- This is super, such a good idea.

658
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:31,253
So ...

659
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:34,882
In Africa ...
- Really incredible.

660
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:40,930
You just said super.
Now does it taste super or incredible?

661
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,432
lt's the same thing.
- Apparently not.

662
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,352
... no interest at all.
- Okay, it tastes ...

663
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,480
... super incredibly delicious.

664
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:51,857
You are talking total nonsense.

665
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:55,778
I've had enough!
- What did l just see?

666
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,531
Ludo is throwing food around!

667
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,741
That's bad!

668
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:04,078
Yes. Children in Africa
don't have enough to eat.

669
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:07,873
Do you know why?
- Globalization?

670
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,793
Smart crocodile. You were listening!

671
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,130
The differences in economic wellbeing

672
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:18,884
and the dependency on foreign aid
vary greatly between countries.

673
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:22,054
This is a kindergarten not a university!
- Shh!

674
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:26,684
Please be quiet, children.

675
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,937
l'm sure some of you want to learn.
- Boring!

676
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,236
There are densely settled
and thinly settled areas,

677
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,489
developing countries
with and without natural resources.

678
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,533
l'm falling asleep.

679
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,203
Children, this isn't any fun.
- Right.

680
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:48,747
lt's a pity you don't like learning.

681
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:52,877
How is it fun if we don't understand?
- I apologize.

682
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,963
The show is over for today.

683
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,341
Think about it.

684
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,598
Couscous again?

685
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,521
Don't let it get you down.

686
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:16,817
Your intentions were good,
but your delivery was a bit dry.

687
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:21,989
Nice of you to say so.
I care so much, I forget myself.

688
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:27,203
There is so much to be done.
Time stops for no man.

689
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:31,457
l'm almost 30 and haven't done anything.
- Excuse me, Ralf.

690
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:36,462
You've done more than us put together.
30 is young, you can do more.

691
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,966
Young? No, no, no.
30 is as old as the hills.

692
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,593
Life is half over.

693
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:46,138
Careful, Ludo is ...
- Can I have the salt?

694
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:52,019
Don't you want to taste it?
- No, I can see.

695
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:57,274
The lnuit, the so-called Eskimos,

696
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:01,528
when they were too old to hunt,
they were put out on a sheet of ice

697
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,906
so they wouldn't be a burden anymore.

698
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:06,533
Really?

699
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,578
This needs salt.

700
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:15,751
ln ancient times, everyone died at 30.

701
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,712
Game over. They were decrepit.

702
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:22,299
Ludo would already be dead.
- Can I have the pepper?

703
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:26,303
You have to age elegantly.
But some things

704
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:30,766
get better with age.
- What? Wrinkles and impotence?

705
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:33,018
Feeding the ducks.

706
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:37,147
Or watching documentaries.
Or rubbing your aching joints.

707
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:42,278
You are talking shit!
I've never fed a duck in my entire life!

708
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,287
Hello? This isn't about you.

709
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:55,582
Why do you always think
everything is about you?

710
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:59,336
Now this is a true story:
I have a friend

711
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:03,757
he's 41 .
He turned impotent over night.

712
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,610
Can I help you?

713
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:26,363
Are your parents terrorists?

714
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:28,907
Excuse me?

715
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:32,036
Are your parents terrorists?

716
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:38,917
No, but my brother is a suicide bomber.

717
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,712
He's on the john.
lf he sees us talking,

718
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:46,300
I may fall victim to an honor killing.
But first, he'll cut out your tongue.

719
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:51,388
Listen! l have a German passport,
was born in Bielefeld, studied in Berlin,

720
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:56,977
and have the same right as you
to be in this country. - No ...

721
00:55:57,395 --> 00:56:01,857
Because you are so hot,
as hot as a bomb. You know?

722
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:05,110
That comment
was sort of an opening to ...

723
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:06,820
Asshole!

724
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:12,910
Hey ...

725
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,287
Listen ...

726
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:19,124
l am an author ...
- Shut up.

727
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,960
... writing a phone book.
- Shut up!

728
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:26,340
Could I have your number?
- Shut up, or I'll smack you.

729
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,260
Retard.
- I can't believe it!

730
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:34,223
A spritzer, please.
- Wine? - Apple juice.

731
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:38,852
Tell me it's not true!
- Apple. - You are such

732
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:42,981
a slut!
You would fuck anybody!

733
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:46,985
I can't help it.
Do you think l do it on purpose?

734
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:51,198
I have an illness.
- lllness? You are a nympho!

735
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:54,952
That's the truth!
- Sammy, sexual addiction

736
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:59,623
is a recognized medical condition.
- Tell the parking meter. l'm gone.

737
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:16,223
l'm Lana, I have a recognized
medical condition, and who are you?

738
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:19,935
Um ...

739
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,229
Ah ...

740
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,443
Can't you speak?
- Moritz ... Moritz.

741
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,111
Moritz- Moritz, sweet.

742
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:34,700
Drink a martini with me, Moritz- Moritz?
- Sure. Sure, um ...

743
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,452
Two martinis, please.

744
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:41,915
Dry? - I said "two."
Am I speaking French or something?

745
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:46,170
Anyway, what was your name again?

746
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:51,884
Lana.  Maybe spelling it backwards
will help you remember it.

747
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:13,906
Ludo,

748
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:17,951
l want to sleep with you
- Now?

749
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,318
What is it?
- I can't.

750
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,615
ls it me?
- No.

751
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:00,369
My mind is racing.

752
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:01,828
Aha.

753
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:05,874
And anyway, l can't do it
with that jerk snoring there.

754
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:13,382
Ludo,
we've done it in the department store.

755
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,385
And now his snoring bothers you?

756
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,179
Sleeping like a baby.

757
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,936
It can happen to anyone.

758
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:31,692
You know you can tell me
even if it's my fault. - Anna!

759
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:37,656
What do you mean, your mind is racing?
What's bothering you?

760
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:40,742
Anna, let's get some sleep.

761
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:02,472
No, not like that.
- Thumb is caught.

762
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:07,227
No, I mean, not at all.
- What? What is wrong?

763
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,771
You know,

764
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:15,110
my sexual addiction has ruined so much.

765
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:20,490
With you, it's the first time
I ever felt l wanted to wait,

766
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:23,493
because you are special.

767
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,914
l'm not that special.
- You are, you are.

768
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:31,293
You are so modest.

769
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:36,381
l want to fall asleep next to you.

770
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,759
That is much more beautiful and intimate

771
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:41,428
than wild, uncontrolled sex.

772
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:43,305
Yes.

773
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:48,602
l can even feel your erection,
and it doesn't bother me.

774
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:52,898
You can be proud.
- Thanks a lot.

775
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:59,154
Good night. Sweet dreams.

776
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:40,570
l booked a table for four o'clock.
We'll do a boat tour first, okay?

777
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:42,030
Okay.

778
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:57,921
l think I look younger.
-  Much younger.

779
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:01,800
Everyone thinks I am younger.

780
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:05,387
Anyway, you're only as old as you feel.

781
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:13,061
What happened to my eye cream?
Did you use it? - Ridiculous.

782
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:14,563
Funny.

783
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:18,817
Why would l use that?
- What do l know?

784
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:23,739
lt was probably Ralf.
- Probably.

785
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:36,710
Man.

786
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:19,711
Yes?
- Lana here.

787
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:24,549
l forgot to say the water's off today.
Don't use the toilet!

788
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:27,511
No, no way!
- Listen, I ...

789
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:31,223
I really want to see you again.
- Thanks, I appreciate it!

790
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,726
Okay. I'll be back as soon as I can.
Maybe you'll still be there?

791
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:37,229
Looking forward to it.
- Me, too.

792
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,940
Ciao.
- Bye.

793
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:02,337
Water! Water ...

794
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,447
Okay. Hey ...

795
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,908
Come to daddy! Hey ...

796
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,365
My phone ...

797
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:57,118
The bag!

798
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:06,419
The crow's feet are no problem.
We'll use Botox.

799
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:10,757
I'll do injections
under these unfortunate laugh lines,

800
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:12,592
and ... uh-oh ...

801
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:19,474
l'll suck out this little fatty bulge.
- l have a double chin?

802
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:23,478
I didn't say that.
l only said you have a fatty bulge.

803
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:28,900
Oh God.
- Don't worry.

804
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:32,278
Look at me. l am way over 40.
And you know what?

805
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:35,573
Without several operations,
I'd still be married to my ex

806
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:39,661
who is as old as I am
and has cellulite on her arms. Eww.

807
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,540
Okay, I'll do it.

808
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:47,293
I don't want to fool you.

809
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:52,173
For really lasting rejuvenation,
these touch-ups don't do much.

810
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:57,303
At your age, the only thing
that really helps is a radical facelift.

811
01:06:57,722 --> 01:06:59,723
I'll cut you open along your hairline,

812
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:03,768
from ear to ear,
loosen and pull back your skin,

813
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:07,814
remove the surplus skin,
and sew you up again!

814
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:11,234
lt'll be a solid as a rock.
So tight, you can't even

815
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:13,361
wrinkle your forehead.

816
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:16,156
My little joke.

817
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:25,874
What about complications?
I don't want to look like Zsa-Zsa Gabor.

818
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:30,587
Nonsense.
Such enormous facial asymmetry

819
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:33,048
hardly ever happens anymore.

820
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:42,140
So ...
Next Tuesday, ten o'clock?

821
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:45,518
Hello?
- Ludo, it's a matter of life and death!

822
01:07:45,936 --> 01:07:48,980
Where are you?
- Calling from a payphone.

823
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:51,483
l forgot my cell and something else!

824
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:55,528
You have to come! Please, please!
Schluter Street 1 0. Okay?

825
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:01,743
Oh man, look. Over there
my shit is lying on the nightstand.

826
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:04,579
We'll go get it back now.
- Okay.

827
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:12,545
Hello?
- Telecom!

828
01:08:27,728 --> 01:08:29,354
Here it is.

829
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:36,069
We'll go in over the roof.

830
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:43,493
I know. I'll tell her
the mailman left a package.

831
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:46,412
From "Colonia" or what?

832
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:23,658
Hold on to me.
- Huh? - Hold on to me.

833
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:31,916
What if we fall and die?
- She'll have a nice goodbye present.

834
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:46,181
You are charged with importing
a Iarge quantity of narcotics.

835
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:51,978
Doesn't she get it?
- She is hot. - That isn't hash, man.

836
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:55,773
Do I Iook Iike Scarface?
- I don't know Scarface.

837
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,317
The Mafia boss.

838
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:06,409
This is total trash.

839
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:16,544
Wicked.

840
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:30,558
Dude, what is going on?

841
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:18,731
Holy shit.

842
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:23,736
Hey! There you are finally!

843
01:11:25,155 --> 01:11:27,282
How was your day?

844
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,952
What happened here?
- What? Um ...

845
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,914
Nothing.
- l mean the window.

846
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:38,334
Um ...

847
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,964
It was a pigeon.
- A pigeon? - Yes.

848
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:46,509
It was really big and fat, very heavy.

849
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:51,764
Where's the pigeon now?
Did it hurt itself?

850
01:11:52,182 --> 01:11:53,224
Ah ...

851
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:57,979
Don't worry, it's in here.
We have a vet appointment.

852
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:00,940
Poor pigeon. Can l see?

853
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:07,905
It smells pretty funny ...
It can't breathe in there.

854
01:12:10,242 --> 01:12:11,492
What are you doing?

855
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:14,871
I gotta run.
- Why?

856
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:17,582
l have to bury the pigeon.

857
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,500
I'll be right back, alright?

858
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:26,841
Ludo!

859
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:36,851
Oh.  My. God.
- What?

860
01:12:40,397 --> 01:12:42,440
On your ear ... it's like ...

861
01:12:47,404 --> 01:12:48,571
Ha! Just kidding!

862
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:59,624
Hello?
- l pick you up in 1 0. - l'm not home.

863
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:03,753
We're supposed to meet. Where are you?
- Where were you? - Where are you?

864
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:07,757
Where were you? - At the bakery.
- Why didn't you answer?

865
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:11,094
Because I didn't hear it.
- Sure, the bakery is so loud ...

866
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:15,348
Please tell me where you are!
- We are already here.

867
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:19,352
We who? - Ralf and l.
We went ahead and are waiting for you.

868
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:21,604
Ralf? You and I had a date.

869
01:13:22,022 --> 01:13:25,608
Ludo, I have been calling all day.
I left you a thousand messages.

870
01:13:26,026 --> 01:13:28,903
lf there's a problem,
l can take the train back.

871
01:13:29,321 --> 01:13:32,115
What did he say?
- lt's not that bad ... Nothing!

872
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:36,828
Get a move on and come here.
We delayed the reservation for you.

873
01:13:58,225 --> 01:14:00,226
l can't find my makeup bag.

874
01:14:00,644 --> 01:14:04,397
You want to put on makeup outdoors?
- Yes.

875
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:06,607
You look best naturally.

876
01:14:07,025 --> 01:14:10,361
l always said so.
Sure.  My eyes are swollen. - Anna,

877
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:12,780
you have the most beautiful eyes ever.

878
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:00,620
So ...

879
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:07,210
You look wonderful.

880
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:10,129
What is that?

881
01:15:10,547 --> 01:15:12,423
Where?
- Something on your eye. Wait.

882
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:13,966
Leave it.

883
01:15:14,384 --> 01:15:16,928
Stop it! Anna, please!

884
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:18,471
Stop it!

885
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:24,685
What can we eat today?
Maybe no couscous this time.

886
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:29,315
He's losing his color, Anna.
- It's ... -  Makeup?

887
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:31,317
Are you wearing makeup?

888
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:38,658
Pathetic! It's not my fault that
this place doesn't wash their linens!

889
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:40,618
Were you really at the bakery?
- Yes.

890
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:43,496
Were you with  Marie?
- That wasn't dirt.

891
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:48,376
You worry about world hunger
and stop bothering us here.

892
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:52,505
What is your problem?
- You're about to have a problem.

893
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:55,967
You think l don't know what's going on?
- What?

894
01:15:56,385 --> 01:16:01,264
You dig in like a tick,
flirting with my girlfriend. - Anna.

895
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:02,557
That's absurd.

896
01:16:05,602 --> 01:16:10,690
Absurd, my ass! Plenty of guys flirt
with me. But it doesn't bother him.

897
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:15,236
Nice for you. You should
add it to your list. - What list?

898
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:17,363
But you should add

899
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:20,741
that his Eiffel tower
is surrounded by bush land.

900
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:23,744
You went through my things!
Unbelievable.

901
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:28,541
Says the acrobat who can read
texts with her feet. - Excuse me,

902
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:31,586
have you decided on anything?
- Yes, um ...

903
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:35,047
Please bring my boyfriend
some privacy to violate.

904
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:40,886
And some sleep-around potatoes
for my ravenous girlfriend.

905
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:42,221
Ravenous?

906
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:45,182
What are you then?
You don't have a list because

907
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:49,687
you can't remember all the sluts' names.
- One plate of sleep-around potatoes,

908
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:52,815
and some hysterical beans?

909
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:57,153
Okay, I'll have
a floppy sausage with mustard.

910
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:00,197
That's absurd.

911
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:07,121
What're you laughing at?

912
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:13,002
Floppy sausage is funny!
- Wipe that grin off your face.

913
01:17:19,843 --> 01:17:20,593
Ludo!

914
01:17:21,511 --> 01:17:24,430
Stop grinning like that.
- lt's a free country.

915
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:27,767
Ludo!
- He started it!

916
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:32,396
He's bleeding! Are you mental?
- That was for his stupid grin.

917
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:38,444
l think my neck is broken.
- You are so primitive!

918
01:17:38,862 --> 01:17:42,365
Hang out a sign at the kindergarten:
"Ludo, our floppy sausage."

919
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:46,619
Have you lost it?
Going apeshit in front of everyone,

920
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:51,040
hitting Ralf. What is your problem?
- Mine? Very good.

921
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:53,751
My problem. Very funny.

922
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:55,086
Excuse me.

923
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:57,838
You forgot your concealer.

924
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:06,472
l am arresting you in the name
of the law for turning my head.

925
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:10,434
Your sentence: a date with me.
Something like that

926
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:13,688
only works in theory,
not in reality. But,

927
01:18:14,272 --> 01:18:18,651
watch this!
You could have saved the Titanic.

928
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:22,738
Your eyes
would have melted that iceberg.

929
01:18:25,992 --> 01:18:27,076
Amazing!

930
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:30,121
Amazing, amazing! Hello?

931
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,582
What are you doing tonight?
- It's party night. - Where?

932
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,713
Bangaloo. Costume party. A huge event.
- l don't have a costume.

933
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:43,092
You want to come?
- I need a costume. - l'll get you one.

934
01:18:43,468 --> 01:18:46,595
But listen,
not a bear costume or shit like that.

935
01:18:47,013 --> 01:18:49,181
Something cool.
- l got it.

936
01:18:54,312 --> 01:18:55,896
I said something cool.

937
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:59,483
Ginger Rogers ...
l'm not going in drag.

938
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:03,529
It was the only thing left.
The very last one.

939
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:09,410
Okay, take that off.
I'm going as Fred Astaire.

940
01:19:10,495 --> 01:19:12,747
Are you crazy? Look at yourself.

941
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:17,168
You're too fat for this.
l barely fit into it.

942
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,588
Come on, Ludo.

943
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:24,091
We'll drink
till we lose the power of speech.

944
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:28,554
Maybe it'll cheer you up.
Paul is DJ'ing tonight.

945
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:36,979
Your spinal column
is definitely undamaged.

946
01:19:38,815 --> 01:19:42,610
What makes you so sure, doctor?
- l do this fulltime.

947
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:43,944
Right.

948
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:47,698
What about my nose?
- lt's broken

949
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:50,618
and dislocated. Does this hurt?

950
01:19:52,996 --> 01:19:53,913
l thought so.

951
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:57,082
What do you mean dislocated?
- It's not that bad.

952
01:19:57,501 --> 01:20:01,420
A clean break and a small displacement.
I'll give you

953
01:20:01,838 --> 01:20:05,966
a local anesthetic
and pull your honker straight.

954
01:20:06,384 --> 01:20:09,261
You don't use full anesthesia?
- Only for children.

955
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:12,932
But if you insist,
l'll be happy to put you under.

956
01:20:14,851 --> 01:20:17,853
No, no. l have a high pain threshold.

957
01:20:19,022 --> 01:20:23,567
In Africa, we didn't even have aspirin.
- l can do it without anything.

958
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:30,115
You sure?

959
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:37,623
On three ...

960
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:40,459
Three!

961
01:20:45,131 --> 01:20:47,925
You'll get a bandage.
Keep it on for five days.

962
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,386
I'll be right back.

963
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:54,431
I pictured this day
going a little differently.

964
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:56,350
I am so sorry.

965
01:20:56,768 --> 01:20:59,228
l'm sure
Ludo has a very guilty conscience.

966
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:05,502
How do l look?
- Hot.

967
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:08,631
I would fuck myself!

968
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:13,010
Where are my breasts?
- Hold on. Here.

969
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:15,512
Can you put them in?
-  My pleasure.

970
01:22:20,518 --> 01:22:21,894
One ...

971
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:24,813
Two ...
- Ouch! Careful!

972
01:22:25,231 --> 01:22:30,653
They're stuck on your rolls of fat.
- I'll give you rolls of fat!

973
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:40,788
These or these?

974
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:42,414
Those.

975
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:45,709
Don't you like these?
- l didn't say that.

976
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:48,545
But you like these better.
- l like them both.

977
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:52,883
But you like these more.
- Ludo! The party will be over!

978
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:57,262
I just want to look nice.
- You look nice in those and those.

979
01:22:57,681 --> 01:22:59,890
Which ones should I put on?
- The dark ones.

980
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:02,851
But these go better with this dress.

981
01:23:03,269 --> 01:23:06,438
So put those on.
- I'll put on these. - There you go.

982
01:23:06,856 --> 01:23:10,776
Or maybe these.
- My God, man!

983
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:18,033
We're back.

984
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:20,536
Ludo?

985
01:23:30,296 --> 01:23:33,924
"Went to a party.
Don't wait up for me.

986
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:37,177
l'll be out late. Ludo." What is this?

987
01:23:37,595 --> 01:23:41,849
First he beats you, then he leaves us
to take the train home, now he's out

988
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:45,477
and partying?
- Why are there two glasses?

989
01:23:48,898 --> 01:23:52,693
Lipstick.
- Really? Shit.

990
01:23:56,448 --> 01:24:00,409
He's out with Marie.
-  Maybe it doesn't

991
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:02,578
mean anything.

992
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:04,413
Come on.

993
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:07,708
He uses concealer, too.

994
01:24:18,928 --> 01:24:21,680
Smile and tits out.

995
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:33,358
Hey, baby!  My brother and l ...

996
01:24:34,986 --> 01:24:38,739
We made a bet you'd give us a kiss.

997
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:44,745
Sorry, you lose.

998
01:24:45,705 --> 01:24:49,958
So I won. C'mere, you're hot.
- Yeah!

999
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:56,799
Keep going!
- The cheek!

1000
01:24:57,717 --> 01:25:00,511
Go for it. I'll put it online!
Keep going!

1001
01:25:07,393 --> 01:25:10,062
You have very bad manners.
And you, too.

1002
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,272
Let's go, dear.
- Lesbians!

1003
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:14,650
What are you looking at, jerk?

1004
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:40,759
Sweetie, l think he likes you.
- Who?

1005
01:25:41,177 --> 01:25:43,345
The rabbit in glasses.

1006
01:25:43,763 --> 01:25:46,390
Are you crazy? l can do better.

1007
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:49,101
Don't be so arrogant,
you're not so young anymore.

1008
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:59,695
No more wine. - No surprise considering
Ludo and Marie had three bottles.

1009
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:02,531
You don't know she was here.

1010
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:07,161
Maybe not.
Ludo could be using lipstick now, too.

1011
01:26:08,246 --> 01:26:11,999
One point for you.
- He left that glass on purpose.

1012
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:14,459
You think so?

1013
01:26:14,878 --> 01:26:19,590
Maybe it's his way of
showing he's upset?

1014
01:26:20,216 --> 01:26:23,677
I can understand he wasn't happy
to read that stuff about me.

1015
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:28,140
No man would be.
- That's ridiculous.

1016
01:26:28,558 --> 01:26:32,019
Ludo knows our sex was super.
Why on earth

1017
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:34,771
did he read it? Why didn't I burn it?

1018
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:37,482
That was careless of you.

1019
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:41,236
He did invade your privacy.

1020
01:26:41,654 --> 01:26:44,990
Well ... I looked in his phone.

1021
01:26:45,408 --> 01:26:49,995
Really? That sucks, Anna.
- Yes, I know.

1022
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:54,249
This is tricky.

1023
01:26:57,170 --> 01:27:00,380
l don't really know him well enough ...

1024
01:27:01,966 --> 01:27:03,675
He is so different from you.

1025
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:15,437
Let's go now.

1026
01:27:15,855 --> 01:27:18,523
The party is just getting started.

1027
01:27:19,525 --> 01:27:22,444
You're as drunk as a skunk. Come on.
- Stay here,

1028
01:27:22,862 --> 01:27:25,322
Moritz.
-  My flight is in an hour.

1029
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:28,659
l'm flying to the  Munich film festival.
I'll take you home.

1030
01:27:29,077 --> 01:27:33,288
Don't want to. Ralf is there.
- Are you sure you're staying?

1031
01:27:33,706 --> 01:27:35,832
l'm going. Take care of yourself.

1032
01:27:38,211 --> 01:27:40,003
You take care, too.

1033
01:27:48,972 --> 01:27:50,514
Hey, baby.

1034
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:52,766
I'm Herb, photographer.

1035
01:27:53,184 --> 01:27:57,479
l'm Ginger.
- You're guite the dancer.

1036
01:27:59,482 --> 01:28:01,942
Want a drink?
- Sure.

1037
01:28:05,863 --> 01:28:08,240
You have a very deep voice.

1038
01:28:08,658 --> 01:28:10,784
No one ever told me that.
- It's true.

1039
01:28:11,202 --> 01:28:14,204
Cheers.

1040
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:21,962
Did you ever
have a woman fake an orgasm?

1041
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:25,007
Nope.

1042
01:28:26,009 --> 01:28:29,094
I would never fake an orgasm.
When l come,

1043
01:28:29,512 --> 01:28:31,805
baby, I come! And how.

1044
01:28:32,223 --> 01:28:35,767
l'll drink to that! Ginger ...

1045
01:28:36,227 --> 01:28:38,437
"HERA LIND - SUPER BROAD"

1046
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:44,609
Are you asleep?
- No, not yet.

1047
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:46,653
You know what?

1048
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:48,363
What?

1049
01:28:49,115 --> 01:28:51,325
l dreamed about you last night.

1050
01:28:52,201 --> 01:28:53,744
Really? What?

1051
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:56,288
No, it's too embarrassing.
- Tell me.

1052
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:00,709
We were in the mountains,
everything was covered in snow,

1053
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:05,255
the sun sparkled in the snow.
At midday we came back

1054
01:29:05,673 --> 01:29:07,883
to our mountain hotel

1055
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:12,429
and had pancakes
and iced pear schnapps.

1056
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:15,599
We were so drunk that afternoon

1057
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:18,810
we went outside
and rolled around like children.

1058
01:29:19,228 --> 01:29:21,646
You threw snowballs at me.

1059
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:24,441
l slipped and fell.

1060
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,527
You know what you did?

1061
01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:43,418
Anna?

1062
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:34,386
Dear God,
please let this be a dream.

1063
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:37,472
Hey, you!

1064
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:41,935
Did I scare you, honey?

1065
01:30:42,395 --> 01:30:43,562
Sorry.

1066
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:45,981
Come back and cuddle.

1067
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:47,315
Come on.

1068
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:53,405
You don't have any tits. Sweet.

1069
01:30:54,615 --> 01:30:56,491
Looks good on you.

1070
01:30:56,909 --> 01:30:58,577
I like boyish women.

1071
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:02,247
What a great night!

1072
01:31:08,504 --> 01:31:11,381
How great was it exactly?
- You're funny.

1073
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:15,427
One of the best nights of my life.

1074
01:31:16,929 --> 01:31:19,681
I could fall in love with you a bit.

1075
01:31:21,976 --> 01:31:23,894
Oh God, l can't believe this.

1076
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:26,688
I don't think you're a slut or anything.

1077
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:31,985
We had sex?

1078
01:31:32,403 --> 01:31:34,196
Hello!

1079
01:31:36,407 --> 01:31:37,199
No.

1080
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:39,493
We were much too drunk.

1081
01:31:43,956 --> 01:31:45,707
But you're a great kisser.

1082
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:08,647
Kopernikus Street 1 0, please.

1083
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:11,191
My feet hurt.

1084
01:32:12,318 --> 01:32:16,112
What is it?
- You have a deep voice for a woman.

1085
01:32:17,490 --> 01:32:19,950
l was at a costume party.
- Looking good!

1086
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:21,785
Really? Thanks!

1087
01:32:23,412 --> 01:32:26,414
Nice taxi.
- Only one in Berlin. l got it cheap

1088
01:32:26,832 --> 01:32:30,835
from a colleague.
- l met him. A total asshole.

1089
01:32:32,004 --> 01:32:35,674
He did some embarrassing stuff.
- Like what.

1090
01:32:36,092 --> 01:32:39,177
He took some guy and his girlfriend
and gave the guy a blowjob

1091
01:32:39,595 --> 01:32:43,723
in broad daylight.
And the girlfriend watched!

1092
01:32:44,141 --> 01:32:48,311
No! - l'm telling you! lt's true!
- What does he do now?

1093
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:51,815
He sells hot dogs at the station.
- Hot dogs? - Yes.

1094
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:56,236
Well, that fits.
- We honk when we go by him.

1095
01:32:56,654 --> 01:32:59,531
Here we are. 8.50, please.

1096
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:01,032
Keep the change.

1097
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:05,870
Thanks. - Can you give him a message?
- Sure. - He gives great head.

1098
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:07,372
No way!

1099
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:11,459
Oh, awesome!
- Very awesome.

1100
01:33:11,877 --> 01:33:13,795
Take care.
- Bye.

1101
01:33:30,646 --> 01:33:32,063
Hello, Ludo!

1102
01:33:34,108 --> 01:33:36,985
You look weird. Where were you.

1103
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:40,030
What do you mean?

1104
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:42,073
lt is 7:30 a.m.

1105
01:33:42,491 --> 01:33:45,327
Where were you?
- Why aren't you at the kindergarten?

1106
01:33:45,745 --> 01:33:47,787
l wonder. Where were you?

1107
01:33:48,205 --> 01:33:49,914
Who's with the kids?
- Ralf.

1108
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:51,583
Ralf?

1109
01:33:52,668 --> 01:33:55,211
Why are you wearing a dress?
- l dressed up as a woman.

1110
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:57,839
l can tell. Why?
- I was at a costume party.

1111
01:33:58,257 --> 01:34:00,925
Where?
- Is this the third degree?

1112
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:03,428
Where?
- At the Bangaloo.

1113
01:34:03,846 --> 01:34:07,515
They close at four.
I'm not stupid. Where were you?

1114
01:34:10,561 --> 01:34:12,520
l was at Herb's.

1115
01:34:12,938 --> 01:34:14,773
l don't know any Herb.
- You don't, I do.

1116
01:34:15,191 --> 01:34:19,277
You don't know any Herb.
- Since last night. - Last night? - Yep.

1117
01:34:19,695 --> 01:34:22,155
Sure. Herb is called  Marie
and has silicone breasts.

1118
01:34:22,573 --> 01:34:26,368
No, Herb is a guy and has a dick.
- Have you turned gay? - No!

1119
01:34:27,536 --> 01:34:30,664
I can handle it. Tell me.
- Anna! l slept there!

1120
01:34:31,082 --> 01:34:33,958
Amazing.
Mr. Decker meets some guy

1121
01:34:34,377 --> 01:34:37,420
and sleeps at his place
the first night. Very credible.

1122
01:34:37,838 --> 01:34:40,423
I was totally drunk.
- That's new.

1123
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:44,177
Ludo, stop lying to me.
If you cheated on me, tell me now.

1124
01:34:44,595 --> 01:34:46,554
We only kissed.
- Kissed?

1125
01:34:46,972 --> 01:34:49,891
Says Herb. l don't remember.
l was too drunk.

1126
01:34:50,309 --> 01:34:53,436
You are a terrible liar.
We have to get going.

1127
01:34:53,854 --> 01:34:57,816
But think up a better story by lunch.
One that l can believe.

1128
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:01,296
Hello, children!

1129
01:36:01,714 --> 01:36:03,548
Hello, Kasperle!

1130
01:36:04,884 --> 01:36:10,430
I'm so excited! It's my birthday,
and all my friends are coming!

1131
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:15,226
Oh great!
The lovely crocodile is already here!

1132
01:36:18,022 --> 01:36:21,316
Hi, crocodile.
Here to wish me a happy birthday?

1133
01:36:24,487 --> 01:36:25,570
Yes?

1134
01:36:29,366 --> 01:36:32,243
Hello, Kasperle. Happy birthday.

1135
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:36,998
The crocodile
is in a bad mood today even though

1136
01:36:37,416 --> 01:36:40,376
there's no one else
l love more in the whole world.

1137
01:36:40,795 --> 01:36:42,962
I wish l could believe that.

1138
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:47,592
But it's hard when Kasperle
spends the night out with other puppets.

1139
01:36:48,969 --> 01:36:52,555
But Kasperle told you
that that was only Herb.

1140
01:36:52,973 --> 01:36:57,268
You have to understand, children,
that "Herb"

1141
01:36:57,686 --> 01:36:59,854
has a really big bust.

1142
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:05,360
Kasperle loves crocodile's jokes!

1143
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:09,489
Let's see how funny
Kasperle finds this!

1144
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:15,495
Are you crazy?
- The crocodile whacked Kasperle!

1145
01:37:16,664 --> 01:37:18,790
No, no, it was all a joke.

1146
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:22,961
Kasperle will now give
the crocodile a great big kiss.

1147
01:37:23,379 --> 01:37:24,754
Then it'll calm down.

1148
01:37:28,759 --> 01:37:29,884
Yummy!

1149
01:37:32,137 --> 01:37:34,973
Cool!
The crocodile is stronger than Kasperle!

1150
01:37:35,391 --> 01:37:39,727
Because the crocodile got enough sleep
and wasn't out all night.

1151
01:37:40,145 --> 01:37:44,399
And Kasperle has to think up
so many fairy tales.

1152
01:37:44,817 --> 01:37:46,818
Do it! Whack Kasperle again!

1153
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:49,779
Ouch!
- Hey, kids!

1154
01:37:50,197 --> 01:37:52,365
Was that funny?
- Yes!

1155
01:37:53,576 --> 01:37:57,370
Did you know that the crocodile
was on the Eiffel Tower?

1156
01:37:57,788 --> 01:37:59,956
I was, too! You can see all of Paris!

1157
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:02,709
Not when the crocodile was there.
At that time

1158
01:38:03,127 --> 01:38:08,006
there was only bush land. The crocodile
was so amazed that it wrote it all down

1159
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:10,091
in its weird notebook.

1160
01:38:12,845 --> 01:38:15,013
Where did Kasperle go?

1161
01:38:25,107 --> 01:38:26,524
Kasperle,

1162
01:38:26,942 --> 01:38:29,652
what happened to your eye?

1163
01:38:32,948 --> 01:38:35,408
Yay, the crocodile won!
- Yes!

1164
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:41,289
Enough. This is getting childish.
- So go. I can manage without you.

1165
01:38:41,707 --> 01:38:42,832
Thanks. Same to you.

1166
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:45,084
What? Go!
- I need a break.

1167
01:38:45,502 --> 01:38:48,421
Me, too.
- You can run this place alone for now.

1168
01:38:48,839 --> 01:38:50,590
No problem. Take care, Ludo.

1169
01:38:59,975 --> 01:39:02,018
Ludo! Wait!

1170
01:39:07,399 --> 01:39:10,944
Ludo, are you leaving for good?

1171
01:39:13,322 --> 01:39:15,406
Don't leave us.

1172
01:39:18,452 --> 01:39:19,494
Look,

1173
01:39:20,412 --> 01:39:24,707
l was always a bad kindergartener. You
need one who really takes care of you,

1174
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:27,710
who doesn't sleep on the job.

1175
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:30,755
But then we couldn't fart in his face.

1176
01:39:32,841 --> 01:39:35,551
That's true.
- Cheyenne Blue, come inside.

1177
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:38,096
Your mom is on the phone.

1178
01:39:40,975 --> 01:39:43,309
Go inside or Anna will be sad.

1179
01:39:43,727 --> 01:39:46,562
l don't want Anna to be sad.

1180
01:39:47,606 --> 01:39:49,691
You see, I don't want that either.

1181
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:54,612
Come.

1182
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:28,146
Thanks again
for letting me stay with you.

1183
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,481
Hey ...

1184
01:40:32,776 --> 01:40:34,277
Maybe he'll be back.

1185
01:40:34,695 --> 01:40:38,740
He didn't come back yesterday
or the days before that. He won't today.

1186
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:42,869
Maybe it's better that way.
- He's right.

1187
01:40:47,624 --> 01:40:51,961
l thought you understood me?
- That l'm here because I still love you.

1188
01:40:54,548 --> 01:40:56,632
But it was so long ago.

1189
01:40:57,718 --> 01:41:01,179
And you left me.
- Yes. lt was a big mistake.

1190
01:41:01,597 --> 01:41:04,474
l never got over you.
I missed you every day.

1191
01:41:04,892 --> 01:41:08,603
l named the well l built after you.
- Really?

1192
01:41:09,021 --> 01:41:13,566
Yes. In a Tanzanian village
there's an "Anna Gotzlowski Well."

1193
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:18,988
lf I could do it all again,
l'd give everything, everything,

1194
01:41:19,406 --> 01:41:24,118
to spend my life with the smartest,
most beautiful woman in the world.

1195
01:41:28,123 --> 01:41:31,501
l hope for your sake
that he sees how lucky he is.

1196
01:41:32,878 --> 01:41:36,881
lf he doesn't,
then I'm sorry, but he's an idiot.

1197
01:41:39,301 --> 01:41:42,553
The problem is
that men and women don't go together.

1198
01:41:42,971 --> 01:41:47,475
They always want to change us.
We're simple. We need our freedom.

1199
01:41:47,893 --> 01:41:52,063
That's exactly what I say.
I need my freedom, too.

1200
01:41:52,481 --> 01:41:55,566
Wow, you are amazing.

1201
01:41:57,778 --> 01:42:01,280
I hear that a lot. I grew up with boys.

1202
01:42:01,698 --> 01:42:06,285
I don't get along well with women.
The bitchiness kills me.

1203
01:42:07,162 --> 01:42:09,831
Women can be so mean to each other.

1204
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:13,167
Yeah.
Let's go to my place for coffee.

1205
01:42:13,585 --> 01:42:17,213
Sounds like a good plan.
- Like l said!

1206
01:42:18,257 --> 01:42:19,674
Wait a sec.

1207
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:29,934
Hey, Ludo. Alone here, too?

1208
01:42:41,822 --> 01:42:44,031
Why is that? What has changed?

1209
01:42:44,449 --> 01:42:50,872
Everything changed. She is the woman
of my Iife. I can be open with her ...

1210
01:42:51,290 --> 01:42:52,498
I can be myself with her.

1211
01:42:52,916 --> 01:42:56,252
l think a man's purpose
is to find the woman of his Iife.

1212
01:42:56,670 --> 01:43:02,425
Yvonne, how about you? WouId you caII
WIadimir the love of your Iife? - Yes!

1213
01:43:02,843 --> 01:43:07,680
When this super taII guy Ieaned down
towards me at this awards ceremony ...

1214
01:43:08,098 --> 01:43:12,643
He smiIed at me, and I knew
something was happening to me.

1215
01:43:13,061 --> 01:43:16,564
Yes, she was in huge pain.
- Why pain? - Because ...

1216
01:43:16,982 --> 01:43:18,900
I had stepped on her toes.

1217
01:43:19,318 --> 01:43:24,864
Yes, and he wears a size 1 4!
- 1 4? You couId put out forest fires ...

1218
01:43:28,410 --> 01:43:30,453
Being as happy as you are here tonight,

1219
01:43:30,871 --> 01:43:34,415
wouId you say there is a secret recipe

1220
01:43:34,833 --> 01:43:36,250
for a perfect reIationship?

1221
01:43:36,835 --> 01:43:39,879
WeII, I think
too many give up too early.

1222
01:43:40,297 --> 01:43:43,966
And I think you need to find
the strength to fight for your love.

1223
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:48,387
No matter how hard it is: You have
to keep fighting! - I'll remind you

1224
01:43:48,805 --> 01:43:53,351
next time you leave your
sweaty boxer shorts on the couch ...

1225
01:43:54,478 --> 01:43:57,146
Yes ...
- Of course l will put them away ...

1226
01:44:01,526 --> 01:44:04,195
HeIIo?
- Ludo.

1227
01:44:04,613 --> 01:44:05,655
How are you?

1228
01:44:06,907 --> 01:44:08,616
Awful, to say the least.

1229
01:44:09,785 --> 01:44:12,787
Are you still mad?
- No.

1230
01:44:14,915 --> 01:44:17,708
Where are you?
- On the toilet.

1231
01:44:18,752 --> 01:44:20,670
Really?  Me, too.
- Really?

1232
01:44:21,630 --> 01:44:22,964
At Herb's?

1233
01:44:25,175 --> 01:44:26,217
No.

1234
01:44:30,514 --> 01:44:32,556
Can I see you tomorrow night?

1235
01:44:34,935 --> 01:44:38,729
That would be good.
- 8 p.m., at the Italian place?

1236
01:44:39,356 --> 01:44:40,398
Fine.

1237
01:44:42,067 --> 01:44:43,150
Sweet dreams.

1238
01:44:44,528 --> 01:44:45,945
You, too.

1239
01:45:09,594 --> 01:45:12,638
Were you waiting?
- No, no problem.

1240
01:45:17,602 --> 01:45:19,729
You're looking good.
- You, too.

1241
01:45:27,863 --> 01:45:31,282
Anna, l have to tell you something.
- I've been thinking a lot.

1242
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:33,951
Me, too.
- Do you believe

1243
01:45:34,369 --> 01:45:37,288
when you're really in love,
that you can forgive bad mistakes,

1244
01:45:37,706 --> 01:45:42,001
even when you got hurt?
- l think you should really try.

1245
01:45:42,419 --> 01:45:43,836
Yes, definitely.

1246
01:45:45,589 --> 01:45:47,757
Forgiving someone can feel good.

1247
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:52,553
Maybe that expresses special love.
- Yes.

1248
01:45:53,096 --> 01:45:56,432
For sure.
True love is to be able

1249
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:58,934
to admit one's mistakes.

1250
01:45:59,353 --> 01:46:03,773
Opening myself shows my partner
what a special place he has in my life.

1251
01:46:04,191 --> 01:46:06,275
Yes.
- And I mean, really,

1252
01:46:06,693 --> 01:46:11,197
even in the most perfect relationship,
it can happen that you fight,

1253
01:46:11,615 --> 01:46:14,700
yell, are mean, cheat,

1254
01:46:15,118 --> 01:46:17,536
or forget to recycle the bottles.

1255
01:46:19,498 --> 01:46:21,624
Or look in their phone.

1256
01:46:24,711 --> 01:46:29,215
Being faithful your whole life
is an impossible ideal nowadays.

1257
01:46:29,633 --> 01:46:30,508
True.

1258
01:46:31,843 --> 01:46:36,013
l would forgive you anything. Really.
- I'd forgive you, too.

1259
01:46:36,431 --> 01:46:40,226
Because l love you very much.
- I love you, too.

1260
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:43,020
From the earth to the moon and back.

1261
01:46:49,903 --> 01:46:52,696
The wine is good.
- Yes, it's super.

1262
01:46:54,241 --> 01:46:56,409
Anna, l screwed up.
- Me, too.

1263
01:46:57,411 --> 01:47:00,329
Go ahead. - You first.
- No, you go. - You were first.

1264
01:47:00,747 --> 01:47:02,206
Okay.

1265
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,709
l was with  Marie last night.

1266
01:47:07,462 --> 01:47:08,879
Great.

1267
01:47:12,008 --> 01:47:14,760
But you didn't sleep with her, right?
- l did.

1268
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:20,683
l think I'm going to puke.

1269
01:47:22,602 --> 01:47:24,562
You fell for her!

1270
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:27,440
"Hello, I'm  Marie.

1271
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:31,527
Come on, let's go crazy.
l'm not a real woman, I am

1272
01:47:31,945 --> 01:47:33,362
your best buddy with tits."

1273
01:47:34,364 --> 01:47:36,490
Anna!
l was lonely and drunk.

1274
01:47:36,908 --> 01:47:40,077
And l was mad at you.
I didn't really want it at all.

1275
01:47:40,495 --> 01:47:43,289
Did you slip on a banana peel?
- Anna!

1276
01:47:44,166 --> 01:47:46,750
lt was just stupid sex.
Wham, bam, thank you ma'am.

1277
01:47:47,169 --> 01:47:50,546
l can't sleep with someone
I don't have feelings for. -  Men can.

1278
01:47:50,964 --> 01:47:52,631
What a cliche!

1279
01:47:53,049 --> 01:47:57,011
What did you want to say? - Still
your turn. - You were with Ralf, right?

1280
01:47:57,429 --> 01:48:01,182
I wasn't "with" him. - Thank God.
- I slept with him.

1281
01:48:03,101 --> 01:48:04,768
Super ...

1282
01:48:09,774 --> 01:48:12,818
You went with that retard?
Anna, what is wrong with you?

1283
01:48:13,236 --> 01:48:15,362
He is so awful.
- Don't worry.

1284
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:18,657
It was just wham, bam, thank you ma'am.
Don't feel hurt.

1285
01:48:19,075 --> 01:48:22,536
I never would have thought it of you.
l never would have.

1286
01:48:24,581 --> 01:48:27,500
We drank some wine. Ludo,

1287
01:48:27,918 --> 01:48:30,753
I was drunk,
mad at you, and lonely.

1288
01:48:31,171 --> 01:48:34,381
That's no reason, Anna.
- I know.

1289
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:37,593
It was a mistake.

1290
01:48:38,678 --> 01:48:40,054
Will you forgive me?

1291
01:48:42,641 --> 01:48:44,642
It's not that simple, Anna.

1292
01:48:45,602 --> 01:48:50,397
When l think how that guy
softened you up

1293
01:48:51,066 --> 01:48:54,276
and that he touched you. lt's ...

1294
01:48:54,694 --> 01:48:57,655
l can't think about it! It's disgusting!

1295
01:48:58,073 --> 01:49:01,116
Excuse me, can you
resolve your sex problems at home?

1296
01:49:01,535 --> 01:49:04,328
What do you want?
Sit down, or I'll smack you.

1297
01:49:04,746 --> 01:49:05,913
Unbelievable!

1298
01:49:13,547 --> 01:49:15,422
Ludo, let's go home.

1299
01:49:19,344 --> 01:49:22,763
l don't have a home.
- Are you serious?

1300
01:49:24,307 --> 01:49:25,349
Yes.

1301
01:49:28,061 --> 01:49:32,606
Ludo, l don't understand. We did
the exact same thing. - No, we didn't.

1302
01:49:33,233 --> 01:49:36,777
How so? - You just said
you can't go to bed with someone

1303
01:49:37,195 --> 01:49:40,197
if you don't feel something.
You need feelings!

1304
01:49:40,615 --> 01:49:42,825
Of course I feel something for him!
I've known him forever!

1305
01:49:43,243 --> 01:49:47,079
We were together for three years!
But those are other feelings!

1306
01:49:51,042 --> 01:49:53,419
You still love him, right?

1307
01:51:00,195 --> 01:51:02,196
Are you sad, Anna?

1308
01:51:03,907 --> 01:51:05,115
A bit.

1309
01:51:07,952 --> 01:51:11,455
ls Ludo coming back?
- I don't think so.

1310
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:15,084
Then l'm sad, too.

1311
01:51:15,502 --> 01:51:19,129
Don't be sad, Cheyenne Blue.
If you miss him,

1312
01:51:19,547 --> 01:51:22,758
your mom can call him,
and he'll come visit you.

1313
01:51:23,176 --> 01:51:26,303
Don't you miss Ludo?
- l do.

1314
01:51:28,014 --> 01:51:30,933
Why don't you want to see him?

1315
01:51:31,768 --> 01:51:34,228
l'd like to see him,
I really care about him.

1316
01:51:34,646 --> 01:51:37,690
But it's not possible right now.

1317
01:51:38,108 --> 01:51:41,151
Ludo said if you wish for something

1318
01:51:41,569 --> 01:51:45,406
and really believe in it,
then it'll happen.

1319
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:50,869
Sometimes two people
wish for too much and then ...

1320
01:51:52,205 --> 01:51:54,998
it still doesn't work
even though they want it to.

1321
01:51:55,417 --> 01:51:56,625
That is silly.

1322
01:51:57,502 --> 01:52:03,549
Once for my birthday,
l wished for a soap bubble machine,

1323
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:06,260
skates, and a bear book.

1324
01:52:06,678 --> 01:52:12,349
First, my mom said it was too much,
but I got it all anyway.

1325
01:52:13,643 --> 01:52:16,311
Your logic is overwhelming. You win.

1326
01:52:16,813 --> 01:52:18,397
l know. l'm clever.

1327
01:52:27,115 --> 01:52:32,953
Y'know what? I'm going to wish
for myself that Ludo comes back.

1328
01:52:33,371 --> 01:52:36,206
Here, this is for you.
- Thanks.

1329
01:53:41,314 --> 01:53:42,356
Dear Anna,

1330
01:53:43,191 --> 01:53:46,693
I'm writing from Leba,
where two years ago

1331
01:53:47,111 --> 01:53:49,196
we took our onIy vacation.

1332
01:53:50,448 --> 01:53:54,034
I took the train to Stettin,
then l hitchhiked and walked

1333
01:53:54,536 --> 01:53:58,580
aIong the tracks. The rest of
the trip was on the oId fishing boat.

1334
01:53:58,998 --> 01:54:01,124
just like we did back then.

1335
01:54:02,293 --> 01:54:06,213
And now I sit here wondering
why l went through all this again.

1336
01:54:06,631 --> 01:54:10,259
I was so happy back then
that l didn't know what to do.

1337
01:54:11,511 --> 01:54:14,054
l never thought
things would end this way.

1338
01:54:15,431 --> 01:54:19,768
I can't think of anything but you and
the dreams that won't be fuIfiIIed now,

1339
01:54:20,186 --> 01:54:23,105
because I was a stupid idiot.

1340
01:54:23,523 --> 01:54:27,192
l know l made the same mistake
you made. Who did what

1341
01:54:27,610 --> 01:54:30,863
with or without feeIings doesn't matter.

1342
01:54:31,281 --> 01:54:35,784
l know I hurt you,
and that makes me very sad.

1343
01:54:36,202 --> 01:54:40,581
You asked me to forgive you, and l said
it wasn't so simpIe. lt is simpIe,

1344
01:54:40,999 --> 01:54:45,210
if l swaIIow my dumb, male pride.
I'm doing that now.

1345
01:54:46,254 --> 01:54:49,923
As I do it,
all the anger is gone. Instead ...

1346
01:54:50,967 --> 01:54:53,719
l am empty and sad.

1347
01:54:55,471 --> 01:54:57,431
Anna, I don't know what to do.

1348
01:54:57,849 --> 01:55:02,895
l miss you so much.
I miss your smell, your skin.

1349
01:55:03,313 --> 01:55:05,063
I miss your Iaugh

1350
01:55:05,481 --> 01:55:08,650
and your swoIIen eyes when you wake up.
l wanted to have

1351
01:55:09,068 --> 01:55:12,779
a little Anna with you or maybe five.

1352
01:55:13,781 --> 01:55:18,702
I know I was inattentive,
not because l didn't Iove you anymore,

1353
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:23,665
but because l took it for granted
that we'd aIways be together. Anna,

1354
01:55:24,876 --> 01:55:28,587
don't put me out on a sheet of ice.
I want a dignified oId age.

1355
01:55:29,005 --> 01:55:33,008
l want to feed the ducks with you.

1356
01:55:33,718 --> 01:55:38,513
I know that I Ieft,
but I reaIIy want to come back.

1357
01:55:38,932 --> 01:55:41,516
l cannot live without you, Anna.

1358
01:55:43,895 --> 01:55:47,648
PS: If you take me back again,

1359
01:55:48,066 --> 01:55:52,611
you can Iet your Ieg and armpit hair
grow as much as you want.

1360
01:55:53,029 --> 01:55:54,488
I promise.

1361
01:55:55,907 --> 01:55:59,242
Anna, I want to come home again.

1362
01:56:14,926 --> 01:56:16,426
Do you like it?

1363
01:56:17,887 --> 01:56:19,304
Looks sexy.

1364
01:56:30,066 --> 01:56:31,984
l don't want a little Anna.

1365
01:56:33,319 --> 01:56:36,071
You couldn't handle it.

1366
01:56:38,032 --> 01:56:42,452
I'd prefer a little Ludo.
Then we can talk about a little Anna.

1367
01:56:46,582 --> 01:56:51,795
Will you still love me when l'm 1 80
and buy pants with an elastic waist?

1368
01:56:52,213 --> 01:56:53,255
Yes.

1369
01:56:54,382 --> 01:56:55,590
I love you.

1370
01:56:56,634 --> 01:56:58,260
I'll always love you.

1371
01:56:59,305 --> 01:57:59,779
