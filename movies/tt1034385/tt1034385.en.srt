2
00:00:55,943 --> 00:00:58,679
We are never very far
from those we hate.

3
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:02,982
For this very reason,

4
00:01:02,984 --> 00:01:06,220
we shall never be truly close
to those we love.

5
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:11,123
An appalling fact.

6
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:14,259
I knew it well enough
when I embarked.

7
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:16,798
But some truths
deserve our attention.

8
00:01:18,298 --> 00:01:20,935
Others are best left alone.

9
00:01:23,637 --> 00:01:26,240
We set sail 67 days ago.

10
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:30,979
September, 1914.

11
00:01:57,405 --> 00:02:02,711
Matches are useless as teats
on a bull above deck.

12
00:02:08,315 --> 00:02:09,717
Thank you.

13
00:02:13,988 --> 00:02:17,825
There's your island.
Look, you see it?

14
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,103
What are you running from?

15
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,873
That was the first question
they asked me

16
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,678
when I decided to go to sea.

17
00:02:38,912 --> 00:02:41,915
Prepare to weigh anchor!

18
00:02:56,062 --> 00:02:59,731
That is a one man job.
Don't need two.

19
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:01,033
Rusky, aren't you listening?

20
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:02,834
Be careful with those
in the back!

21
00:03:02,836 --> 00:03:06,041
Don't get 'em wet!

22
00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:12,344
Careful with that.
Don't throw stuff about.

23
00:03:12,346 --> 00:03:18,053
Get that rope in! Rope!
Are you listening to me?

24
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:37,903
Come on, come on!
Put him on the rope!

25
00:03:37,905 --> 00:03:39,374
Move it!

26
00:03:44,144 --> 00:03:45,810
No birds.

27
00:03:45,812 --> 00:03:49,116
No weather official
to greet you, either.

28
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:35,326
Captain, sir,
where we leave the luggage

29
00:04:35,328 --> 00:04:36,929
of officer of air and winds?

30
00:04:36,931 --> 00:04:38,831
Here inside.

31
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,499
Tell the others to hold off
with the rest of the provisions.

32
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:43,235
No.
No, bring it forth.

33
00:04:43,237 --> 00:04:45,237
With respect,
I am responsible

34
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:48,607
for your safe passage,
and this is hardly reassuring.

35
00:04:48,609 --> 00:04:50,945
And you've already provided
such passage.

36
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:08,160
It had to be taken
as an act of kindness

37
00:05:08,162 --> 00:05:11,196
that the captain accompanied me
onto dry land.

38
00:05:11,198 --> 00:05:15,033
Nothing obliged him,
but during the journey,

39
00:05:15,035 --> 00:05:16,968
we had come to one of those
understandings

40
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,240
that sometimes arise between
men of different generations.

41
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:24,076
The captain
always treated me

42
00:05:24,078 --> 00:05:26,280
with the courtesy
of an executioner.

43
00:05:28,082 --> 00:05:32,153
If he could do anything
for me... he would.

44
00:05:43,097 --> 00:05:46,301
Boys?
Go back to the boat.

45
00:06:23,237 --> 00:06:26,241
You in there!
Open up!

46
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:36,316
Can you hear me?!

47
00:06:40,688 --> 00:06:42,523
Hello!

48
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:17,991
Hello?

49
00:07:41,515 --> 00:07:44,085
Hey! Wake up.

50
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:49,720
Fetch water toad.

51
00:07:49,722 --> 00:07:53,759
Wake up!
Maritime signal technician.

52
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:57,396
We are replacing the weather
official, Aldor Vigeland.

53
00:07:57,398 --> 00:07:59,366
Can you tell me
of his whereabouts?

54
00:08:06,073 --> 00:08:09,443
I said where is
the weather official?

55
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:15,614
Listen here, I'm captain
of a ship in transit.

56
00:08:15,616 --> 00:08:18,115
I had to change course
to bring this man here

57
00:08:18,117 --> 00:08:20,785
and take his predecessor away.

58
00:08:20,787 --> 00:08:23,457
- Now where is...
- Typhus.

59
00:08:25,058 --> 00:08:28,593
- He's dead?
- Do you have any tobacco?

60
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:30,261
Vodka?

61
00:08:30,263 --> 00:08:33,531
Where are the man's remains?

62
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:36,037
Christ, man, speak up!

63
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:42,808
He went out one day.
I never saw him again.

64
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:47,212
For God's sake, it's an island!
How far could he have gone?

65
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:48,447
A swim?

66
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:50,685
Your name?

67
00:08:54,088 --> 00:08:55,687
Gruner.

68
00:08:55,689 --> 00:08:57,823
You like Frazer?

69
00:08:57,825 --> 00:09:00,294
That's not my book.

70
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:03,495
You, you have tobacco?

71
00:09:03,497 --> 00:09:05,366
Not on my person, no.

72
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:08,632
Ah.

73
00:09:10,104 --> 00:09:12,706
Mr. Gruner.

74
00:09:28,888 --> 00:09:30,390
Captain.

75
00:09:31,725 --> 00:09:33,391
I appreciate your concern,

76
00:09:33,393 --> 00:09:35,430
but I'm not about
to turn back now.

77
00:09:37,697 --> 00:09:38,832
Take this.

78
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:43,568
Don't mistake stubbornness
with stupidity.

79
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:47,407
I'll manage.
Thank you for all you've done.

80
00:09:50,576 --> 00:09:53,844
Eat well.
Work hard.

81
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:55,449
Stay busy.

82
00:09:59,452 --> 00:10:00,519
Fair winds.

83
00:10:00,521 --> 00:10:03,524
And following seas.

84
00:10:21,675 --> 00:10:25,676
I would have to live
in a solitude-like exile

85
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:29,514
for 12 months
far from civilization

86
00:10:29,516 --> 00:10:32,383
with a job as monotonous
as it was insignificant...

87
00:10:32,385 --> 00:10:35,322
to log the intensity
and direction of the winds.

88
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:15,666
Mr. Gruner?

89
00:15:22,075 --> 00:15:23,710
Mr. Gruner?

90
00:15:25,644 --> 00:15:26,877
Mr. Gruner, if this is your idea
of an initi...

91
00:18:20,352 --> 00:18:22,121
Open the door!

92
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:28,294
Let me in!

93
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:35,135
Gruner?!

94
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:38,705
Gruner!

95
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:44,311
Gruner!

96
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,282
Please let me in!

97
00:18:52,284 --> 00:18:53,987
Should've stayed on the boat

98
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:57,357
Gruner!

99
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:07,801
Gruner!

100
00:19:17,476 --> 00:19:20,278
When I have fears
that I may cease to be,

101
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,115
before my pen has gleaned
my teeming brain,

102
00:19:24,117 --> 00:19:26,951
before high-piled books,
in charactery

103
00:19:26,953 --> 00:19:30,120
hold like rich garners
the full ripened grain,

104
00:19:30,122 --> 00:19:33,124
when I behold
upon the night's starred face

105
00:19:33,126 --> 00:19:36,359
huge cloudy symbols
of a high romance

106
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:39,163
and think that I may never
live to trace their shadows

107
00:19:39,165 --> 00:19:41,765
with the magic hand of chance,

108
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:44,969
and when I feel,
fair creature of an hour,

109
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:47,070
that I shall never look
upon thee more,

110
00:19:47,072 --> 00:19:49,307
Never have relish
in the faery power

111
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:51,242
of unreflecting love,

112
00:19:51,244 --> 00:19:55,512
then on the shore of
the wide world I stand alone,

113
00:19:55,514 --> 00:19:59,786
and think till love and fame
to nothingness do sink.

114
00:20:55,007 --> 00:20:56,476
Mother of God.

115
00:26:11,623 --> 00:26:13,890
No! Don't shoot!

116
00:26:13,892 --> 00:26:15,494
Put your gun down!

117
00:26:19,365 --> 00:26:20,534
Put it down!

118
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:30,844
Step back.

119
00:26:32,611 --> 00:26:34,246
Step back!

120
00:26:37,582 --> 00:26:38,715
What do you want?

121
00:26:38,717 --> 00:26:40,753
Do I really need
to spell it out?

122
00:26:44,423 --> 00:26:45,923
You said you have tobacco?

123
00:26:45,925 --> 00:26:47,892
Yes.

124
00:26:47,894 --> 00:26:50,627
- Coffee?
- Yes.

125
00:26:50,629 --> 00:26:54,798
- Vodka?
- Gin. And ammunition.

126
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,503
Caliber?

127
00:27:04,243 --> 00:27:05,712
There's plenty more.

128
00:27:08,747 --> 00:27:11,848
- She's harmless.
- Harmless?

129
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,186
Come here.
Come here,

130
00:27:16,688 --> 00:27:18,257
Come on.

131
00:27:19,926 --> 00:27:22,492
Good girl, easy.
Good.

132
00:27:22,494 --> 00:27:24,531
See?

133
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,704
I think I'll call you...
Friend.

134
00:27:48,788 --> 00:27:50,421
You got bit?

135
00:27:50,423 --> 00:27:51,558
Burned.

136
00:27:53,225 --> 00:27:55,695
- How many'd you kill?
- Don't know.

137
00:27:58,397 --> 00:28:01,999
The previous weather official.
It wasn't typhus.

138
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:05,501
You left him stranded here
like me.

139
00:28:05,503 --> 00:28:07,771
It's as good as murder.

140
00:28:07,773 --> 00:28:09,576
We gotta go.

141
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:22,688
Come on!

142
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:54,554
Pain gone?

143
00:28:56,656 --> 00:28:59,792
- How long was I out for?
- Day or two by my reckoning.

144
00:29:01,494 --> 00:29:02,829
Pissed your pants.

145
00:29:17,076 --> 00:29:19,643
1,862.

146
00:29:19,645 --> 00:29:22,482
Now that's what I call
an armory.

147
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:26,916
What's it doing?

148
00:29:26,918 --> 00:29:30,724
Stupid thing.
Thinks stuff'll float away.

149
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:35,425
You can speak with the beasts.

150
00:29:35,427 --> 00:29:36,963
Not speak, command.

151
00:29:39,831 --> 00:29:41,498
Doesn't it try and escape?

152
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,335
Does a dog leave even
the cruelest of masters?

153
00:29:44,337 --> 00:29:47,538
It's incredible.

154
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,574
I never even imagined
such things could exist.

155
00:29:50,576 --> 00:29:52,443
What we know is a small island

156
00:29:52,445 --> 00:29:54,513
in the vast ocean
of what we don't.

157
00:30:00,086 --> 00:30:02,051
I've heard that there
are atolls that contain

158
00:30:02,053 --> 00:30:03,953
unique and endemic species
of fish

159
00:30:03,955 --> 00:30:06,089
that have evolved
completely independently.

160
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:11,028
Hangover species that have
survived in isolation,

161
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:14,000
stuck in a kind
of evolutionary stalemate.

162
00:30:16,702 --> 00:30:18,402
Maybe these beasts
are like that,

163
00:30:18,404 --> 00:30:23,810
not quite human nor amphibian,
reptile or fish.

164
00:30:25,144 --> 00:30:27,881
She's not quite like
the others, is she?

165
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:32,715
This one doesn't bite,
that's all.

166
00:30:32,717 --> 00:30:35,452
What about that scar
on your shoulder?

167
00:30:35,454 --> 00:30:37,087
There was one time.

168
00:30:37,089 --> 00:30:39,525
The only time.
She learned her lesson.

169
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,994
Remember, it's the still
and silent sea

170
00:30:44,996 --> 00:30:46,699
that drowns a man.

171
00:30:53,638 --> 00:30:56,973
I adjusted the mechanism
to sweep the coastline.

172
00:30:56,975 --> 00:31:00,877
All I know is that the toads,
like all infernal beasts,

173
00:31:00,879 --> 00:31:04,114
they shun light,
human or divine.

174
00:31:04,116 --> 00:31:06,416
Demons from Atlantis.

175
00:31:06,418 --> 00:31:08,786
I believe in what I see.

176
00:31:08,788 --> 00:31:11,155
One thing I still can't
understand

177
00:31:11,157 --> 00:31:13,690
is that you could have escaped
four days ago on the boat

178
00:31:13,692 --> 00:31:16,126
- that brought me here.
- Escape? To where?

179
00:31:16,128 --> 00:31:17,860
To a civilized world.

180
00:31:17,862 --> 00:31:22,065
Nice place,
that civilized world of yours.

181
00:31:22,067 --> 00:31:23,770
That why you gave it up?

182
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:28,105
Here I'm master
of my own destiny,

183
00:31:28,107 --> 00:31:30,174
- come hell or high water.
- Well, you can keep it.

184
00:31:30,176 --> 00:31:32,909
I'm signaling the first ship
that passes by.

185
00:31:32,911 --> 00:31:36,646
Really? This island is not on
any commercial shipping lanes.

186
00:31:36,648 --> 00:31:38,182
The next ship here will be
the one with your replacement.

187
00:31:38,184 --> 00:31:40,017
Come on, Gruner,
lighthouses are built

188
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:41,684
- where there's naval transit.
- They're also built

189
00:31:41,686 --> 00:31:44,221
to balance navy budgets
and siphon funds.

190
00:31:44,223 --> 00:31:48,427
Gotta empty a bucket before
you can fill it up again, boy.

191
00:31:53,498 --> 00:31:57,436
It is the second time in a
week I'm forced to rebuild my life.

192
00:31:59,003 --> 00:32:02,572
All my belongings are burned.

193
00:32:02,574 --> 00:32:04,910
I've nothing from the person
I used to be.

194
00:32:06,145 --> 00:32:08,578
In this remote part
of the world,

195
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,048
I feel a sense
of irreparable loss.

196
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:15,918
I can't tell whether it arises
from a longing for civilization,

197
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,255
a prisoner's panic...

198
00:32:19,257 --> 00:32:20,759
or simply fear.

199
00:33:12,645 --> 00:33:14,912
Don't!
Don't eat that.

200
00:33:14,914 --> 00:33:17,517
It's... it's not edi...

201
00:33:20,084 --> 00:33:21,854
It's a can...

202
00:33:24,255 --> 00:33:26,525
Friend, get your rifle.

203
00:33:58,089 --> 00:33:59,956
Don't shoot till
they reach the tower,

204
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:01,925
and don't waste bullets
on their wounded.

205
00:34:01,927 --> 00:34:04,230
Give them enough carrion,
they'll devour each other.

206
00:34:26,085 --> 00:34:28,117
I don't see anything.

207
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:30,353
You'll learn
what to look for.

208
00:34:58,884 --> 00:35:00,217
Come on!

209
00:35:00,219 --> 00:35:03,085
Come on!

210
00:35:03,087 --> 00:35:05,154
Shoot, man! Use your gun!

211
00:35:12,264 --> 00:35:13,900
Come on, shoot!

212
00:36:18,297 --> 00:36:20,797
No man is an island.

213
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:26,869
Horse shit.
Gruner is an island.

214
00:36:26,871 --> 00:36:30,507
Gruner does not need
any dead weight,

215
00:36:30,509 --> 00:36:36,148
no matter how much chocolate
and coffee ladybird brought!

216
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:44,256
Go fetch some water.

217
00:38:11,944 --> 00:38:13,311
One last chance.

218
00:39:13,205 --> 00:39:16,375
Hold. Hold fast.

219
00:39:18,342 --> 00:39:21,578
Wait. Hold.

220
00:39:23,147 --> 00:39:24,382
Steady.

221
00:39:31,156 --> 00:39:34,590
Behind you!
Wake up, man! Wake up!

222
00:39:34,592 --> 00:39:39,462
Shoot! Shoot, dammit! Shoot!
Shoot! One last chance!

223
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,378
Gruner,
wait, don't! Gruner!

224
00:39:57,214 --> 00:39:59,616
Gruner! Help!

225
00:39:59,618 --> 00:40:03,520
Gruner!
Gruner, let me in!

226
00:40:03,522 --> 00:40:06,188
Gruner!

227
00:41:45,523 --> 00:41:47,424
Gruner and I settled into

228
00:41:47,426 --> 00:41:52,462
a curious sort of co-existence
based on routine.

229
00:41:52,464 --> 00:41:55,398
The monsters always swarm
at night,

230
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,201
their strikes growing longer
every day.

231
00:41:59,203 --> 00:42:01,570
The Japanese
philosopher Musashi said

232
00:42:01,572 --> 00:42:05,407
that only a few
appreciate the art of war.

233
00:42:05,409 --> 00:42:08,677
A good warrior is not defined by
the cause he defends

234
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:11,449
but rather by the meaning
that derives from the struggle.

235
00:42:13,384 --> 00:42:15,784
Days are always the same.

236
00:42:15,786 --> 00:42:17,719
I abandon my post
on the balcony

237
00:42:17,721 --> 00:42:19,355
at the break of dawn.

238
00:42:19,357 --> 00:42:22,625
Nature dictates
the length of my slumber.

239
00:42:22,627 --> 00:42:25,427
I have to accept the most
ungrateful tasks

240
00:42:25,429 --> 00:42:28,299
simply to keep my place
inside the lighthouse.

241
00:42:29,868 --> 00:42:31,800
I've been meditating
on my reason

242
00:42:31,802 --> 00:42:33,205
for coming to this island.

243
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:38,677
I had been seeking peace
through nothingness.

244
00:42:39,777 --> 00:42:42,277
But in place of silence,

245
00:42:42,279 --> 00:42:44,749
I found a monster-plagued
inferno.

246
00:42:48,853 --> 00:42:50,686
Smells strange.

247
00:42:50,688 --> 00:42:52,654
How do you know that
the herbs aren't bad?

248
00:42:52,656 --> 00:42:55,491
Herbs are like people.
They are neither good or bad.

249
00:42:55,493 --> 00:42:57,460
They're just known or unknown,
that's all.

250
00:42:57,462 --> 00:43:00,230
Herbs won't slit
your throat for money.

251
00:43:00,232 --> 00:43:02,831
A farmer keeps cows.
He cares for them.

252
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:07,302
He feeds them.
He gives them endearing names.

253
00:43:07,304 --> 00:43:08,640
Like Daisy.

254
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:13,311
But then he steals her milk.

255
00:43:15,212 --> 00:43:16,846
And he kills her children.

256
00:43:16,848 --> 00:43:18,882
Another riddle.

257
00:43:18,884 --> 00:43:20,849
It's a question
of necessity.

258
00:43:20,851 --> 00:43:23,219
Has it ever occurred to you
that it might be her wailing

259
00:43:23,221 --> 00:43:24,623
that attracts the beasts?

260
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,192
But then why would they attack
some nights and not others?

261
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:33,163
And why would she lure her
own kin to die on the rocks?

262
00:43:33,165 --> 00:43:35,297
The only thing you need
to understand

263
00:43:35,299 --> 00:43:39,268
is that we are the invaders,
which makes us the enemy.

264
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:42,838
Kill and conquer,
that's what we humans do.

265
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,507
You want to conquer them.
Is that it?

266
00:43:45,509 --> 00:43:47,879
Oh, no,
I want to exterminate them.

267
00:43:58,223 --> 00:43:59,558
We need more timber.

268
00:44:02,226 --> 00:44:03,793
Why?

269
00:44:03,795 --> 00:44:05,865
We haven't been attacked
in weeks.

270
00:44:07,866 --> 00:44:09,902
You like sleeping
in my lighthouse.

271
00:44:19,511 --> 00:44:21,413
Faded.

272
00:44:22,647 --> 00:44:24,183
Far away.

273
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:28,353
Dissolved.

274
00:44:34,292 --> 00:44:35,627
And quite forgotten.

275
00:44:56,248 --> 00:45:00,817
My eyes have scrutinized
every surface a thousand times.

276
00:45:00,819 --> 00:45:03,353
We speak of the lighthouse
and its environs

277
00:45:03,355 --> 00:45:06,021
as if it were an entire state.

278
00:45:06,023 --> 00:45:08,194
Every nook
and cranny has a name.

279
00:45:09,493 --> 00:45:11,460
Every rock.

280
00:45:11,462 --> 00:45:12,931
Every stone.

281
00:45:19,036 --> 00:45:21,839
Maybe they migrate,
like the whales in winter.

282
00:45:24,808 --> 00:45:27,409
Or maybe the creatures reason
they can't defeat us.

283
00:45:27,411 --> 00:45:29,411
They're beasts.

284
00:45:29,413 --> 00:45:33,516
They are out there gathering in
numbers for their next attack.

285
00:45:33,518 --> 00:45:35,487
You're on watch.

286
00:45:42,993 --> 00:45:45,395
Although it may seem strange,

287
00:45:45,397 --> 00:45:47,529
the lulls between fighting
are often worse

288
00:45:47,531 --> 00:45:49,400
than the battles themselves.

289
00:45:51,435 --> 00:45:52,735
This void is accompanied

290
00:45:52,737 --> 00:45:55,340
by the mascot's change
in attitude.

291
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:33,342
How could Gruner lie with one of
the very same monsters

292
00:46:33,344 --> 00:46:35,513
that plague us every night?

293
00:46:40,784 --> 00:46:45,520
How did he manage
to justify the act in defiance

294
00:46:45,522 --> 00:46:48,459
of all the obstacles
set down by civilization?

295
00:46:50,728 --> 00:46:52,297
Set down by nature.

296
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,447
How could he get closer...

297
00:47:11,449 --> 00:47:12,885
and closer...

298
00:47:17,121 --> 00:47:20,525
and not be repelled
by her cold skin?

299
00:47:25,929 --> 00:47:27,765
I have decided
to give her a name.

300
00:47:29,534 --> 00:47:30,903
Aneris.

301
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:37,442
Down.

302
00:48:00,998 --> 00:48:02,898
When'd we run out of potatoes?

303
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,936
We didn't.
You're drinking 'em.

304
00:48:15,513 --> 00:48:16,848
You play?

305
00:48:17,848 --> 00:48:19,751
What civilized man doesn't?

306
00:48:24,788 --> 00:48:27,190
These beasts really are
a fascinating species.

307
00:48:27,192 --> 00:48:29,192
Take the blood,
for example.

308
00:48:29,194 --> 00:48:32,228
I imagine that it must
share the properties

309
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:36,098
of some arctic fish containing
a kind of anti-freeze

310
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,934
to help them to survive
in sub-zero conditions.

311
00:48:38,936 --> 00:48:42,070
Have you noticed that they've
got two sets of eyelids?

312
00:48:42,072 --> 00:48:43,773
Now the first,
very much like ours,

313
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,576
but the second
is a transparent membrane

314
00:48:46,578 --> 00:48:48,511
helping them when they dive,
I would imagine.

315
00:48:48,513 --> 00:48:51,713
We could capture specimens,
take them back to Great Britain

316
00:48:51,715 --> 00:48:54,183
or to the United States,
present our discovery,

317
00:48:54,185 --> 00:48:56,585
- and we would be celebrated...
- All right, you got me!

318
00:48:56,587 --> 00:48:59,721
I came down to the asshole
of the world to become famous.

319
00:48:59,723 --> 00:49:01,724
All right? Check!

320
00:49:01,726 --> 00:49:03,494
Now shut up and play.

321
00:49:07,965 --> 00:49:09,201
Check mate.

322
00:49:14,505 --> 00:49:17,572
No, i-it can't be.

323
00:49:17,574 --> 00:49:19,074
I-it j...
it just can't be.

324
00:49:19,076 --> 00:49:21,043
Calm down, Gruner,
it's only a game.

325
00:49:21,045 --> 00:49:23,182
- Kings, pawns.
- It can't be!

326
00:49:25,817 --> 00:49:27,683
We forgot the light!

327
00:49:27,685 --> 00:49:29,221
Galley deck!

328
00:50:48,132 --> 00:50:51,537
I'm out! There's too many!
There's too many!

329
00:51:55,866 --> 00:51:57,668
So what do we know do now?

330
00:52:05,043 --> 00:52:08,213
♪ One starry night ♪

331
00:52:09,813 --> 00:52:14,150
♪ As I lay sleeping ♪

332
00:52:14,152 --> 00:52:17,987
♪ One starry night ♪

333
00:52:17,989 --> 00:52:20,989
♪ As I lay in bed ♪

334
00:52:22,125 --> 00:52:25,695
♪ I dreamed I heard ♪

335
00:52:25,697 --> 00:52:30,299
♪ Wagon wheels creakin' ♪

336
00:52:30,301 --> 00:52:36,842
♪ Molly Ban, a storeen,
come and lay me down ♪

337
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:41,780
I wh...

338
00:52:59,163 --> 00:53:00,795
Look at us.

339
00:53:00,797 --> 00:53:04,366
We can't survive
another assault like that.

340
00:53:04,368 --> 00:53:09,471
We're running out of supplies.
Running out of ammunition.

341
00:53:09,473 --> 00:53:11,042
Running out of will.

342
00:53:58,054 --> 00:53:59,521
Where are you going?

343
00:53:59,523 --> 00:54:02,426
- Hey! What is it?
- There's a boat!

344
00:54:21,978 --> 00:54:23,348
No!

345
00:54:26,183 --> 00:54:28,116
Gruner knows
how to defend himself.

346
00:54:28,118 --> 00:54:30,219
Gruner rules the world!

347
00:54:30,221 --> 00:54:34,190
Gruner wants what he has
and has only what he wants!

348
00:54:39,931 --> 00:54:42,297
- Ungrateful little bitch!
- No.

349
00:54:42,299 --> 00:54:45,169
- Get out of my way, boy!
- Please, Gruner.

350
00:54:58,215 --> 00:55:01,317
No more people.

351
00:55:01,319 --> 00:55:04,453
I see what you are!

352
00:55:04,455 --> 00:55:08,924
A sad, pathetic failure
of a misanthrope!

353
00:55:08,926 --> 00:55:12,328
You're too afraid
to let your friends leave!

354
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:15,230
Too afraid
to kill your enemies!

355
00:55:15,232 --> 00:55:18,302
Afraid of having
no one left to hate.

356
00:56:31,074 --> 00:56:32,277
Look.

357
00:56:39,083 --> 00:56:40,351
Look.

358
00:56:55,065 --> 00:56:57,002
What has he done
to you this time?

359
00:57:12,583 --> 00:57:15,619
We call this... a "boat."

360
00:57:21,257 --> 00:57:22,627
You see?

361
00:57:40,444 --> 00:57:41,612
What?

362
00:58:51,482 --> 00:58:53,217
I found a rowboat.

363
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:56,617
I know of it.

364
00:58:56,619 --> 00:59:00,322
Sorry, what?
Why didn't you say so?

365
00:59:00,324 --> 00:59:02,123
Wouldn't do you no good.

366
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:03,625
I'm sure you'll make it
off my island.

367
00:59:03,627 --> 00:59:06,795
Then you'd be taken by
hypothermia, starvation,

368
00:59:06,797 --> 00:59:10,766
a storm, most likely end up
as toad food, but, hey,

369
00:59:10,768 --> 00:59:13,405
who am I to deny you the right
to choose how you die?

370
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:18,440
- Where'd it come from?
- Belonged to some Portuguese.

371
00:59:18,442 --> 00:59:20,541
- Shipwreck?
- Tremendous storm.

372
00:59:20,543 --> 00:59:22,444
Came to grief in the night.

373
00:59:22,446 --> 00:59:24,579
And I'm sure you did everything
you could to save them.

374
00:59:24,581 --> 00:59:27,148
I did what I could.

375
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:29,217
Those that made it ashore
were set upon

376
00:59:29,219 --> 00:59:31,453
trying to reach
the lighthouse.

377
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:33,255
Nothing left of them
by the morning.

378
00:59:33,257 --> 00:59:35,424
Dragged back down
to the depths.

379
00:59:35,426 --> 00:59:38,226
What were they doing so far
from commercial routes?

380
00:59:38,228 --> 00:59:41,130
It was an illegal ship.
Dynamite smugglers.

381
00:59:41,132 --> 00:59:44,433
Found some crates
washed up ashore.

382
00:59:44,435 --> 00:59:46,603
No good though,
all waterlogged.

383
01:00:01,217 --> 01:00:04,820
You want to dive that ship.

384
01:00:04,822 --> 01:00:07,755
We recover the dynamite,
repair the rowboat,

385
01:00:07,757 --> 01:00:11,692
head out in the morning
at low tide when it's safest.

386
01:00:11,694 --> 01:00:13,561
You're an idiot.

387
01:00:13,563 --> 01:00:15,898
What is it about blowing up
a thousand toads you don't like?

388
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,900
Suicide mission, I'm not
going down in that water.

389
01:00:17,902 --> 01:00:19,404
Scared?

390
01:00:23,273 --> 01:00:24,706
I'll do it.

391
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:27,241
All I require from you
is to pump my air.

392
01:00:27,243 --> 01:00:28,911
Won't work.

393
01:00:28,913 --> 01:00:30,746
I'm talking
about toad extermination.

394
01:00:30,748 --> 01:00:32,350
No!

395
01:02:23,527 --> 01:02:25,761
I changed my mind.

396
01:02:25,763 --> 01:02:27,699
We leave right away.

397
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:00,829
Remember,
one tug on the rope,

398
01:03:00,831 --> 01:03:03,665
everything's fine,
two, load is secured.

399
01:03:03,667 --> 01:03:04,902
Three....

400
01:03:07,503 --> 01:03:09,440
Three,
row for your life.

401
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,988
The second line's too close
to the lighthouse.

402
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:28,657
At this distance,

403
01:08:28,659 --> 01:08:31,059
the toads will be packed in
nice and tight,

404
01:08:31,061 --> 01:08:33,060
like a can of sardines.

405
01:08:33,062 --> 01:08:36,299
We'll end up perched
on the leaning tower of Pisa.

406
01:08:58,221 --> 01:09:01,355
The Austral summer
is fading timidly

407
01:09:01,357 --> 01:09:02,860
but with grandeur.

408
01:09:04,794 --> 01:09:08,065
Now we are inexorably
heading toward the winter.

409
01:09:10,066 --> 01:09:12,002
Or rather, the darkness.

410
01:09:19,709 --> 01:09:22,212
Time is a relative idea.

411
01:09:23,879 --> 01:09:26,247
Drops suspended
from a spider web

412
01:09:26,249 --> 01:09:29,484
for centuries
before it falls.

413
01:09:29,486 --> 01:09:32,052
Sometimes, however,

414
01:09:32,054 --> 01:09:34,792
a week passes
in the blink of an eye.

415
01:11:16,959 --> 01:11:18,828
Come inside.

416
01:11:56,333 --> 01:11:59,868
Three weeks.
Three weeks and nothing.

417
01:12:28,632 --> 01:12:31,399
- We can't eat that garbage!
- Gruner.

418
01:12:31,401 --> 01:12:33,600
She told them.
You told your friends, huh?

419
01:12:33,602 --> 01:12:35,903
You warned them, didn't you?
Huh?!

420
01:12:35,905 --> 01:12:40,207
You fucking little toad spy.
This is how you repay me, huh?

421
01:12:40,209 --> 01:12:41,643
- You ungrateful, bitch!
- Gruner!

422
01:12:41,645 --> 01:12:43,978
How dare you leave me?!
Dare you leave me!

423
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:45,979
- Gruner...
- Try it! Try it again!

424
01:12:49,552 --> 01:12:51,653
We ambush them.

425
01:12:51,655 --> 01:12:53,921
We leave the main door open
and lure them inside.

426
01:12:53,923 --> 01:12:55,590
You pick them off
from the stairs.

427
01:12:55,592 --> 01:12:58,429
I operate the detonator
once they're close enough.

428
01:14:22,312 --> 01:14:25,212
Gruner, Babel's open.

429
01:14:25,214 --> 01:14:27,583
- Lanterns!
- Burning.

430
01:15:45,294 --> 01:15:49,130
Come on,
come on, sing! Come on!

431
01:15:49,132 --> 01:15:53,501
Come on! Come on! Sing!
Sing! Sing for your supper!

432
01:15:53,503 --> 01:15:55,802
Sing! Sing!

433
01:15:55,804 --> 01:15:57,704
Sing! Sing!
There you go!

434
01:16:53,262 --> 01:16:57,133
Sing! Sing! Come on!

435
01:18:04,234 --> 01:18:05,802
They're in!

436
01:18:11,807 --> 01:18:13,476
They're here!

437
01:18:28,391 --> 01:18:29,860
It's not working!

438
01:18:32,829 --> 01:18:34,364
The contact!

439
01:19:05,661 --> 01:19:06,862
Get down!

440
01:19:15,672 --> 01:19:17,441
No, Gruner...

441
01:20:18,034 --> 01:20:19,469
Gruner.

442
01:20:21,137 --> 01:20:25,741
Gruner, can you hear me?
Gruner.

443
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:41,921
Under the wide
and starry sky...

444
01:20:41,923 --> 01:20:44,627
dig my grave
and let me lie.

445
01:20:45,762 --> 01:20:49,497
Glad did I live
and gladly die.

446
01:20:49,499 --> 01:20:52,336
And I laid me down with a will.

447
01:21:41,517 --> 01:21:44,054
Use your knife.
Don't waste ammunition.

448
01:21:58,767 --> 01:22:00,636
Look at what we've done.

449
01:22:50,585 --> 01:22:52,755
She'll do that for a time.

450
01:22:54,656 --> 01:22:56,692
Wail away like that.

451
01:22:59,529 --> 01:23:02,296
That's how I found her.

452
01:23:02,298 --> 01:23:06,833
Tangled in a net,
little tyke.

453
01:23:06,835 --> 01:23:09,472
Cute that way,
aren't they?

454
01:23:11,307 --> 01:23:13,109
They don't stay that way.

455
01:23:15,745 --> 01:23:18,144
Cut it free.

456
01:23:18,146 --> 01:23:20,149
Saved its life, I did.

457
01:23:25,288 --> 01:23:27,557
It'll come groveling back.

458
01:23:29,825 --> 01:23:31,958
She always does.

459
01:23:50,045 --> 01:23:51,815
They're mourning.

460
01:25:45,428 --> 01:25:47,197
Look at this.

461
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:51,165
It's brilliant.

462
01:25:51,167 --> 01:25:55,836
We have to keep up the pretense.
New, more powerful weapons.

463
01:25:55,838 --> 01:25:57,706
Putting the fear in them.

464
01:31:08,017 --> 01:31:11,551
I see you, king of the toads!

465
01:31:11,553 --> 01:31:14,020
Don't harm them, Gruner.

466
01:31:14,022 --> 01:31:16,390
A truce is what I think
they want.

467
01:31:16,392 --> 01:31:19,629
Gruner, put your rifle down.
Show them that you mean no harm.

468
01:31:23,398 --> 01:31:25,168
We were wrong.

469
01:31:26,567 --> 01:31:29,304
Gruner, we were wrong.

470
01:31:37,045 --> 01:31:38,580
Go inside.

471
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:46,656
I said inside!

472
01:31:52,694 --> 01:31:54,496
Leave me?

473
01:31:56,065 --> 01:31:59,232
No one leaves.
No one leaves.

474
01:31:59,234 --> 01:32:02,836
I leave.
No one leaves Gruner!

475
01:32:02,838 --> 01:32:05,704
You don't leave.

476
01:32:05,706 --> 01:32:08,444
You don't leave.
You don't leave.

477
01:32:10,111 --> 01:32:11,346
No one leaves Gruner!

478
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:16,149
Gruner leaves.
Gruner leaves... Gruner...

479
01:32:16,151 --> 01:32:18,385
you don't leave Gruner, no!

480
01:32:18,387 --> 01:32:20,487
You don't leave!
Gruner leaves.

481
01:32:20,489 --> 01:32:24,157
No one leaves Gruner.
No one leave Gruner!

482
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:27,030
Gruner leaves.

483
01:33:15,744 --> 01:33:16,909
Wait.

484
01:33:44,373 --> 01:33:47,940
Gruner!

485
01:33:47,942 --> 01:33:51,446
Gruner! Gruner!

486
01:34:21,642 --> 01:34:24,446
Aldor Vigeland,
you're no murderer!

487
01:34:51,339 --> 01:34:52,775
Love.

488
01:34:56,410 --> 01:34:57,746
Love.

489
01:35:01,717 --> 01:35:03,319
Love.

490
01:37:04,772 --> 01:37:06,342
Mr. Gruner?

491
01:37:08,610 --> 01:37:11,714
Maritime signal
technician Gruner.

492
01:37:14,014 --> 01:37:16,319
All right, get up!

493
01:37:26,928 --> 01:37:30,729
We are here to replace the
weather official with this man.

494
01:37:30,731 --> 01:37:32,767
Do you know where he is?

495
01:37:35,637 --> 01:37:37,373
Speak up!

496
01:37:40,741 --> 01:37:42,775
Typhus.

497
01:37:42,777 --> 01:37:46,845
Ugh, this place is a pigsty!

498
01:37:46,847 --> 01:37:48,614
Look at yourself.

499
01:37:48,616 --> 01:37:50,716
You are in no fit state
to hold the position

500
01:37:50,718 --> 01:37:52,051
of signal technician.

501
01:37:52,053 --> 01:37:55,424
We're at war, man!
Get back here!

502
01:37:58,959 --> 01:38:02,429
I believe the poor soul
is ill from isolation, sir.

503
01:38:02,431 --> 01:38:03,896
You know the saying.
No man...

504
01:38:03,898 --> 01:38:07,602
We'll have him seen to.
Search the island.

505
01:39:12,142 --> 01:39:17,142
