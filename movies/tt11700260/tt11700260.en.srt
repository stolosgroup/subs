00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:22,415
HAPPY 80TH, DON HUMBERTO

4
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,499
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

5
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,832
I couldn't sleep last night.

6
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:59,749
I was thinking and thinking.

7
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,665
Alright...

8
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,749
How do people see me?

9
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,790
How do they see me?

10
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,540
As a man who started from nothing

11
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:20,665
and today is a leader
in the pharmaceutical industry

12
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:24,249
and feeds almost 10,000 families.

13
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,165
What do I care about that?

14
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,374
I'll tell you how they see me.

15
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,582
As a millionaire,

16
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,249
with an obscene fortune,

17
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,540
but with no prestige.

18
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:46,707
Well, through your foundation
you've helped to set up projects...

19
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,332
Everyone knows
what foundations are for.

20
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,707
That building is practically unused.

21
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,415
I've turned 80.

22
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,874
I want to be remembered differently.

23
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,832
I don't know,

24
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,332
to do something that lasts.

25
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,915
A bridge, for example,

26
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,082
designed by a famous architect.

27
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,249
A bridge with my name on it.

28
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,665
To finance it,
then donate it to the State.

29
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:35,999
The Humberto Suárez Bridge.

30
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,749
Or if not, a movie.

31
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,124
A movie?

32
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,290
You want to direct a movie?

33
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,624
No, you idiot,
how can I direct a movie?

34
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,665
To finance a movie.

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,665
To be the maker.

36
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,749
So that people know I'm behind it.

37
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,040
But not any movie.

38
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,540
A great movie,

39
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:19,124
with a great director,
famous actors,

40
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,040
with the best.

41
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,290
A movie.

42
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,749
Yes, it's the best option.

43
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,999
A movie.

44
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,582
Sorry, excuse me.

45
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,915
What would it be about?

46
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,290
How should I know?

47
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,957
Lola Cuevas, the director.

48
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,707
She's the most prestigious now.

49
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,624
She snaps up all the awards.

50
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,457
Highly prized by the critics.

51
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,332
She never grants interviews.

52
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,249
She's kind of strange.

53
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,707
Her films:
<i>The Inverted Rain,</i> from 1996.

54
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,582
Her first work,
acclaimed around the world.

55
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,124
<i>The Void,</i> 2001. Very weird,
not as celebrated as the previous one.

56
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,207
<i>Haze,</i> 2015.
Considered her masterpiece.

57
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,749
She's been waiting a few minutes.

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,040
Remind me a bit about this project.

59
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,624
It's all fine,
we have the book rights.

60
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:38,540
-It was a tough negotiation, but...
-Sure, I found out what we paid.

61
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,707
You asked me to prioritise it.

62
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:44,207
One thing is prioritising,
another is getting fucked.

63
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,499
But anyway, we've got it now.

64
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,124
-Lola...?
-Cuevas.

65
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:57,415
Iván Torres and Félix Rivero.
They're the perfect actors for this.

66
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,874
They're being sounded out now,
and it's all go,

67
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:04,415
despite loads of difficulties,
which was expected.

68
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,165
They belong to different worlds.

69
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:14,499
Iván is the master actor,
very prestigious,

70
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,415
and Félix is...

71
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,790
a worldwide star.

72
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,207
I'm interested in that tension,
I think it'll help us a lot.

73
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,249
And they've never worked together.

74
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,832
I don't know...

75
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,915
I want the best.

76
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,207
Are they the best?

77
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,332
Better, worse...

78
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,124
wouldn't use those terms
to define an artist,

79
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,249
but I get your question

80
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:46,165
and the answer is yes,
they're absolutely the best for this.

81
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,374
Excellent.

82
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,540
-You really don't want any?
-No, you go ahead.

83
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:55,207
Well, getting the book wasn't easy.

84
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,790
But that's it.

85
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,249
We have it, it's mine now.

86
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,790
You know I'll do a very loose version
of the novel, don't you?

87
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,457
It was the first thing I said
when they called me.

88
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,499
But there will be
something of the book left?

89
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,749
It cost me a fortune.

90
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,290
Tell me,

91
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,156
what did you think?

92
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,499
It's meant to be good, isn't it?

93
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,457
It's a Nobel Prize winner.

94
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:27,124
I'd love you to tell me
what it's about.

95
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,040
I haven't read it yet.

96
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,582
I'm not much of a reader, actually.

97
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,915
How do I tell you?

98
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,082
<i>Rivalry</i> is...

99
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,790
Alright then...

100
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,665
It's the story of two brothers:

101
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:57,707
Manuel is dull, introverted,

102
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,082
and his brother Pedro,
his older brother,

103
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,124
is very sure of himself, and rich.

104
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:10,249
1970: a country town.

105
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,082
Manuel is driving his parents
down a road.

106
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,040
It's night and he's drunk.

107
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,290
He loses control and the car
rolls over and over.

108
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,249
I hate drunks.

109
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:25,415
The parents die in the crash.
Manuel is unhurt.

110
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,915
Pedro, the other brother,
reports him to the police.

111
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:29,665
Well done.

112
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:33,331
Then Manuel is sentenced
to several years in prison.

113
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,874
Meanwhile, Pedro goes on
with his life

114
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:39,874
and has a relationship with Lucy,
a whore at the town brothel.

115
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,415
Everyone is suspicious
of Pedro's luxuries.

116
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,374
He has a foundry,

117
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,332
but nobody believes that
the money comes from there.

118
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,415
Years go by
and Manuel gets out of prison.

119
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:54,332
Pedro knows his brother is free
but they never meet.

120
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,624
Until one day Manuel goes to
the brothel and sleeps with Lucy.

121
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,957
His brother finds out, proposes to Lucy
and offers her a life of luxury.

122
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,582
Lucy says yes.

123
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,165
Manuel sinks into a terrible depression.

124
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,249
Then he finds out
that Lucy is pregnant.

125
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:14,332
He begins to wonder
if the child is his.

126
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,957
The baby is born.

127
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,332
But is it his or not?

128
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:19,999
Wait, I'll go on.

129
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,249
One day Manuel steels himself
and goes to Pedro's house.

130
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,749
He knocks on the door.

131
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,249
Pedro opens up.

132
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,040
Manuel sees Lucy with the baby

133
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,374
in a scene of devastating ordinariness.

134
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,499
Manuel asks, almost begs
to talk to his brother.

135
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,707
The brothers walk around
the estate at night, in darkness.

136
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,124
Manuel apologises to Pedro.

137
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,582
Pedro relents.

138
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,040
The brothers embrace
and cry like children.

139
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,040
Because men do cry.

140
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,082
I love it. It ends well.

141
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,249
I like the ending.
The brothers have reconciled.

142
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,957
Wait, it doesn't end there.

143
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,124
There's still the ending.

144
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,957
OFFICIAL COMPETITION

145
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,124
Take care of it!

146
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,665
Maestro, we meet at last.

147
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:55,332
It'll be a real honour
to work with you.

148
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:57,999
Thank you.

149
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:00,874
Let's go.

150
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,707
Well...

151
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,874
First rehearsal, eh?

152
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,415
Good luck, pal.

153
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,124
You'll need it.

154
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,165
Sure.

155
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,915
So will you.
Don't get too confident.

156
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,415
Coats.

157
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,457
Thank you.

158
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,165
Go ahead.

159
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,332
Look, there she is.

160
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,624
Lola, good afternoon.

161
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:42,082
I really rushed to finish it,
but it's turned out very well.

162
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,249
A lot of work, loads.

163
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,332
It ended up a bit bulky.

164
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,582
With all my notes.

165
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,249
I can't stop.

166
00:12:56,916 --> 00:13:00,374
How about we do a short exercise?

167
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,499
Okay.

168
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,832
How do you see your character, Iván?

169
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:11,999
I've thought a lot about Pedro
all these months.

170
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,332
I think Pedro's...

171
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:20,040
driving force has been
to outdo his younger brother

172
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,540
in front of their parents.
*

173
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:25,290
So let's say that Pedro
has done everything right,

174
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:30,040
he's always been steadfast,
secure, even with women.

175
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,332
A football fan,

176
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,040
a touch of the macho,
aggression, nationalism...

177
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,582
He channels the primitive side,

178
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,915
joining other primates
on the bleachers of the stadium.

179
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,457
He gets up early.

180
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:51,040
He's a simple, optimistic man.

181
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,582
And I think that
he never wanted children,

182
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,332
although he ended up
with one at this late stage.

183
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,124
I love the idea of two brothers
forming a single entity,

184
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,540
but split into two bodies.

185
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,249
Look.

186
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,707
They try to lead their lives
on different paths,

187
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,874
but an unexpected event
puts them in opposition.

188
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:13,624
Yes, yes.

189
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:17,457
The fate of one is irrevocably linked
to that of the other.

190
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,374
In fact, what happens to one,

191
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,040
-happens to the other, right?
-Exactly.

192
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,249
Félix, how do you see your character?

193
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:32,499
Manuel, my character, doesn't exist.

194
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,749
Pedro, his character, doesn't either.

195
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:36,624
-Oh no?
-No.

196
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,040
They're black ink on white paper.

197
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:43,957
I don't need to know my character's past,
because he doesn't have one.

198
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:48,624
I'll study the words and say them
with conviction and authority.

199
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:52,165
That'll be enough,
the people will see Manuel.

200
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,415
When you go to the doctor,

201
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,957
you don't need him to tell you
his life story to believe him.

202
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,332
If he has a white coat, a diploma
on the wall and a stethoscope,

203
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,707
-to the audience he's a doctor.
-That underestimates the audience.

204
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:10,540
Well...

205
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,457
And it underestimates the actor,
it underestimates our work.

206
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,082
-No, I don't think so.
-Yes.

207
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,874
Anyway, I haven't argued about
these things for 30 or 40 years.

208
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,749
You can never be so sure of
what the audience perceives

209
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,249
about you or the character.

210
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,540
There's an exercise I do
with my students.

211
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,124
I tell them that when they're alone

212
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,832
to call themselves out loud.

213
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,832
For that very reason, to see
and feel themselves from outside.

214
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,749
I know it sounds silly...

215
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:46,624
-Sounds good.
-...but it's quite distressing.

216
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:49,457
Iván!

217
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:53,624
Iván!

218
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,582
Iván!

219
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,499
Iván!

220
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,332
Oh, jeez...

221
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,790
Poor kids, poor kids.

222
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,290
I want to return to what you said
about the character,

223
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,249
that he doesn't want children.

224
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,790
I think it's a major detail.

225
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,207
So do I, it is.

226
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,624
-Do you have children?
-Yes.

227
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,707
Five.

228
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,749
-Five? All with the same one?
-Yes.

229
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,915
All with this guy.

230
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,301
Sorry, you gave it to me
on a platter.

231
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,832
Yes, five with four
different women, yes.

232
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,124
Do you have any Iván?

233
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,707
Sorry?

234
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,624
-Do you have any children?
-Yes, yes.

235
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,999
One from my first marriage.

236
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,707
He's grown up now, over 40.

237
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,332
With Violeta,
we've been together for 28 years,

238
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,249
we tried at the time,

239
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,624
but now it's a little late.

240
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,749
-I would have liked to.
-Okay.

241
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,749
-Do you have...?
-No. Nor do I want to.

242
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:07,999
I think an artist without children
has a huge advantage.

243
00:17:08,165 --> 00:17:10,957
You can create freely, without fear.

244
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,124
With children, there's panic.

245
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,539
People become conservative,
have no ideas. It's normal.

246
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,289
With children to take care of,

247
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:23,749
with the constant worry that
something bad could happen to them...

248
00:17:23,915 --> 00:17:28,874
it doesn't leave much room
to create anything risky, but anyway...

249
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,915
Can you face me so that I can
see you better when we read?

250
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:46,374
Well, Félix, we may have
different work methods,

251
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,707
but we do agree on
the mediocrity of having children.

252
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,332
-Shall we read?
-Yes, of course.

253
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:55,957
Let's go.

254
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,957
"Scene 1: interior, night,
Pedro's house.

255
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,624
Pedro is told about the crash.

256
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,957
The phone rings.
It's 11:30 at night.

257
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,332
Pedro looks at the time and answers."

258
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,707
"Hello."

259
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,415
"A man's voice on the other end.

260
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,874
Pedro knows it's a policeman.
He answers."

261
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,040
"Good evening. Who is it?"

262
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,124
Again, please.

263
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,332
What?

264
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,874
"Good evening". Again.

265
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,707
-"Good evening."
-Once more.

266
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,415
"Good evening."

267
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:29,999
Once more.

268
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,790
-"Good evening."
-Again.

269
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,582
"Good evening."

270
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,624
Once more.

271
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,082
"Good evening." Do we carry on?

272
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,624
No, because it's not right.

273
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:59,332
You know that "good evening"
can mean many things, don't you?

274
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,874
An invitation, an apology,
an attack, a thousand things.

275
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,832
Here, this "good evening" must say:

276
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,249
"What the hell's happened
for the police to call me

277
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,249
at 11 o'clock at home?"

278
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:15,790
All that?

279
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,207
All that.

280
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,707
You can do it perfectly well.
Let's go.

281
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,665
"Good evening."

282
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,249
That's it.

283
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,374
That's it.

284
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,707
"Scene 2: exterior, night, road.

285
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,665
Pedro reaches the scene of the crash.

286
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:41,332
An overturned car, an ambulance,
and his parents' bodies on the asphalt.

287
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,540
Beside them is Manuel, kneeling,
crying desperately, a cop beside him."

288
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:46,707
Pedro.

289
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,957
Excuse me, Lola.

290
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,957
A small observation on this text.

291
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,999
Here the script says:

292
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,582
"What happened?
What have you done, you fucking drunk?"

293
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,540
I think Pedro should first just ask

294
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:06,124
"What happened?", without the insult.

295
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,999
I think it's better
if he's more restrained at first,

296
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,207
trying to understand the situation.

297
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,582
Later, yes...

298
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:18,332
as he gradually gets angrier,

299
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,665
he explodes at his brother,

300
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,790
but not...

301
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,582
What do you think?

302
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,249
No, it's better to say it
as it's written.

303
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:34,124
Let's go from where Pedro arrives
at the scene of the crash.

304
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,290
Iván.

305
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:40,290
"What happened? What have
you done, you fucking drunk?"

306
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:41,874
"Sorry, sorry.

307
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:45,957
Something ran in front of me,
a dog or whatever..."

308
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,374
-Stop. Let's stop for a moment.
-Yes.

309
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,874
-One crucial thing that you know...
-Yes.

310
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,707
A drunk tries not to look drunk,
isn't that right?

311
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,457
Even more if he's caused an accident.

312
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,332
Then let's...

313
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,249
How...?

314
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,749
Imagine your level of drunkenness

315
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:08,207
from 1 to 10, 10 being really drunk.
Try to give me a 3.

316
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,749
Very well.

317
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,082
A 3.

318
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,624
Sorry, sorry.

319
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,832
Something ran in front of me,
a dog or whatever...

320
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,165
A 5.

321
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,457
Sorry, sorry.

322
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:29,874
Something ran in front of me,
a dog or whatever...

323
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,540
A bit more, a 6.5.

324
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,040
Sorry, sorry.

325
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:42,707
Something ran in front of me,
a dog or whatever...

326
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,082
That's it, Félix, right there.

327
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,457
I felt it too.

328
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:51,499
Yes.

329
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:55,749
Did you see?

330
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:59,290
Back into the brain,
no one can survive that.

331
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:00,290
-Nobody?
-Nobody.

332
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:01,624
I believe you.

333
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:02,999
Alright, another one.

334
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:07,082
Some guy comes along
and hits you square in the face.

335
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:07,915
Alright.

336
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,582
Because you stole his girlfriend
or he just doesn't like you.

337
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,207
-For whatever reason.
-Okay.

338
00:22:14,365 --> 00:22:15,582
-Okay.
-Go.

339
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,707
-Slowly first, right?
-Yes, in slow motion.

340
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,249
-Go.
-That's it.

341
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:24,165
Okay, now we use
the inertia of his body,

342
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,082
to pull him forward.

343
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:30,040
It's very simple, but it works.

344
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,165
-It works.
-Yes.

345
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,582
-Let's go.
-Good.

346
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,874
Go on.
We'll do it a bit faster, okay?

347
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,957
-Did you see?
-Can I try?

348
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,082
-Go ahead.
-I'm going to try.

349
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,749
Let's see if I can do it.

350
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,249
Come on!

351
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:50,790
Ready?

352
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,665
At most,

353
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,082
at most, one of you,

354
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,332
only one,

355
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,999
will finish this hard road

356
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,707
and get to be a professional actor.

357
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,957
One at most.

358
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,915
So, if there's anyone here

359
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:21,249
who's not absolutely sure
that they're this chosen one,

360
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:27,124
I ask you, please, to leave the room
and not come back.

361
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:32,999
The world needs engineers,
dentists, lawyers,

362
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:36,124
people who turn the wheel,
labourers who work,

363
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:39,832
but one thing it doesn't need
is more actors.

364
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,874
Does no one have any doubts?

365
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,374
No.

366
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:57,624
Yes.

367
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,582
Maybe.

368
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:03,457
This guy is in every fucking movie
in this country. No.

369
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:04,874
Maybe.

370
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:05,874
No.

371
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,124
Yes.

372
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,040
No.

373
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:09,040
No.

374
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,290
No.

375
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,582
No way.

376
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:12,499
No.

377
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,582
No.

378
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:17,415
What a bland face. No.

379
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:21,624
This cross eyed one, maybe.

380
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,665
No.

381
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,124
No.

382
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,249
No.

383
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:28,207
No.

384
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:29,290
No.

385
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:31,082
Yes.

386
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:34,915
-Hey, he was a student of mine.
-Really?

387
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:38,082
-Yes. Not much talent, poor guy.
-Then no.

388
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,290
No, no, please, let him!

389
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:43,124
You don't have to be a genius
to sit without saying a word.

390
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:43,999
Take him, please.

391
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,874
-We'll include him for you.
-Thanks.

392
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:48,332
They are actors, aren't they?
I don't want any surprises.

393
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,624
Yes, they're all actors.

394
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,540
Poor guys.

395
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:54,082
-I'd keep...
-Excuse me.

396
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,207
Apologies for Félix's delay.

397
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:59,207
He had to see the doctor,
but he'll be here in a minute.

398
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,582
I warn you, he's not in a good mood.

399
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,415
I don't give a crap.
And who is this?

400
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:06,249
Félix's errand boy.

401
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:07,582
Come, come.

402
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,499
I'll introduce you.

403
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:10,707
Darío, Félix's personal assistant, Iván

404
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:12,540
Iván, a pleasure to meet you.

405
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:14,999
I'm a big fan,
I really admire you.

406
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:17,165
Thank you very much.

407
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,665
Rook!

408
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:30,582
Rook!

409
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,207
Cartagena!

410
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:42,582
I'm ready.

411
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:43,624
He's ready.

412
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:47,749
The issue is what I do with
all these projectiles on me.

413
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:50,707
You won't be doing this
before every take, will you?

414
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:54,101
Hey, it's my method,
it works for me.

415
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:56,540
-It disturbs me. Do it further away.
-Sure, sure.

416
00:25:56,708 --> 00:26:00,040
-And I assure you, it does no good.
-No, it does for me. Oh, yeah.

417
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,457
Shall we begin?

418
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:05,499
Remember, we're in the prison,
in the visiting area,

419
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:08,540
with reinforced glass
between the two of you.

420
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:10,290
-You talk on the phone.
-Okay.

421
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:11,790
-Ready?
-Yes.

422
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,665
Okay, let's go.

423
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:15,040
Action.

424
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:22,082
Mum and Dad would hate you
if they were alive.

425
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,374
Don't even say their names!
You should've died in the crash.

426
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:27,124
Okay, stop. Let's go back.

427
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:30,707
Here, Pedro bangs the glass hard.

428
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:33,249
He's very upset,
he starts to cry.

429
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:35,082
Do it, please.

430
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,415
What?

431
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:37,999
Your actions.

432
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:41,082
Do your actions.
Cry, I want to see it.

433
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:45,457
There's no need,
I'll do it in the take.

434
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:49,165
I can't cry gratuitously,
just like that.

435
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:51,290
I've never been asked to.

436
00:26:51,416 --> 00:26:54,415
I have to be in the situation.
I have to be focused.

437
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:56,874
But don't worry,
my emotion is on point.

438
00:26:57,041 --> 00:26:59,665
No, I'm not worried,
but I want to see it.

439
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:02,082
Otherwise, I can't direct you.

440
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:05,957
I don't need to do it
in a reading, frankly.

441
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,374
The script says
that Pedro cries, right?

442
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:10,249
Sure.

443
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:12,249
-Well, how do we do it?
-That's...

444
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,707
-Don't try to do it well.
-Okay.

445
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:17,540
Find the truth.

446
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:22,749
What are you doing?

447
00:27:25,416 --> 00:27:26,874
Crying.

448
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:28,790
Weeping.

449
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,582
Tears.

450
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:34,124
Menthol. I always use it.

451
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:37,332
Or do you need to remember
your dead grandma to cry?

452
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,915
I don't know, eh?

453
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:41,915
-You're not using that in my film.
-It works!

454
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:43,774
Let's go again.
I'll watch from here.

455
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:45,874
Let's go from "Mum and Dad".

456
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,290
Action.

457
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:53,165
Mum and Dad would hate you
if they were alive.

458
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:56,457
Don't even say their names!
You should've died in the crash.

459
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,040
Let it out, Iván!

460
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:00,124
Hold on...

461
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:06,415
Give me a break, man!

462
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:09,124
-Why are you doing this? Why?
-Nothing happened.

463
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:13,332
Don't be an asshole!
Look, blood. I'm bleeding!

464
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:18,082
Are you all right Félix?

465
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,165
Lola, Iván can't do this.

466
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:24,749
This is my work tool, eh?

467
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,832
This time I'll let it go,
but next time...

468
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,999
I swear I'll smash
that fools face in, eh?

469
00:28:32,708 --> 00:28:34,999
When you get a film actor,

470
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:38,457
don't get one who needs
this whole circus.

471
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:39,999
Plus, he has an Argentinian accent.

472
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:42,665
20 years in Spain
and he still has the accent.

473
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:43,499
He has no accent.

474
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,249
As if there weren't Spanish actors
who could play my brother.

475
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:47,915
There must be a hundred.

476
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,415
Come on, you still have time.

477
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:52,957
Paco Carrasco.
A wonderful actor, wonderful.

478
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:55,249
-Let's see...
-Yeah.

479
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:58,082
Or Emilio Aravena..

480
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:00,540
Emilio's very good too, eh?

481
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:03,165
He's very good.

482
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:31,915
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

483
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,082
Don't get side-tracked.

484
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:41,457
I may have to call my lawyer.

485
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:44,749
Come on, rehearse!

486
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,499
He's all better.

487
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:52,540
-By contract you can't touch his face.
-What?

488
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,374
I thought you knew.

489
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:56,624
Why would I know that crap?

490
00:29:56,791 --> 00:29:59,582
Is that true? It's extraordinary.

491
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:01,332
It's pretty wild.

492
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:06,249
Come on, let's act.

493
00:30:07,791 --> 00:30:09,499
Let's go.

494
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:15,165
The link between these two brothers
is broken now,

495
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:16,832
it has shattered.

496
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:21,707
But something is still alive, okay?

497
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,582
Let's work on that,
that impotence.

498
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:27,749
But restrained, Iván.

499
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:32,957
Let's go for it.

500
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,082
Action.

501
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:42,499
You're despicable.

502
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,207
I'm your brother.

503
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:48,999
I'm all you have.

504
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:56,457
How can you live knowing that
you sent your only brother to prison?

505
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:02,457
Leave that to me
and my conscience.

506
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:06,249
You've only got two years left.

507
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:09,499
For causing a massacre.

508
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:11,999
It's nothing.

509
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:22,665
Mum and Dad would hate you
if they were alive.

510
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:24,415
Don't even say their names!

511
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:27,415
Don't even say their names!

512
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:32,165
You should've died in the crash.

513
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,040
You.

514
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,124
Very good, Iván.

515
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:14,749
-Thank you.
-Very good.

516
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:24,608
You don't have to smash
a chair to show anger.

517
00:32:24,826 --> 00:32:26,249
Sorry about that.

518
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:29,249
We're not acting
for row 48 in a theatre.

519
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:32,415
-You're right. A thousand pardons.
-Okay.

520
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,082
-I don't know...
-It's fine, it's fine.

521
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:37,249
-The tension... Forgive me.
-Forget it. It's over.

522
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:41,207
Anyway, in the end
it turned out great.

523
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:44,540
I'll tell you something.
I'm sure we'll make a great movie.

524
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:45,707
I hope so.

525
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:49,957
I can see us getting an Oscar
in the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.

526
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:52,082
Your speech in English.
You do speak English, right?

527
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,707
-No, not at all.
-No?

528
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:56,540
I'd never subject myself
to that circus.

529
00:32:56,833 --> 00:32:59,665
I don't want to be the Latino
who puts a bit of colour

530
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:02,665
into that entertainment industry
for numbskulls.

531
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:06,290
You go, you like it,
that's why you work...

532
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:08,832
I won't say no.
Yeah, yeah, I'll go.

533
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,999
-See?
-Yeah, sure.

534
00:33:12,541 --> 00:33:15,915
Hey, this wardrobe is great.

535
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:23,415
Check out the lesbian-looking
eyesore outside.

536
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:26,999
I bet you 100 euros
she's one of Lola's girlfriends.

537
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:28,332
Done.

538
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:36,540
Félix, this is Violeta, my wife.

539
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:39,790
Nice to meet you.

540
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:42,207
-Charmed.
-Nice to meet you.

541
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:46,290
Félix, I'd like to give you
my latest book.

542
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,165
She writes children's stories.

543
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,082
I'm sure you've heard her name.
Violeta Valderrobles.

544
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:57,874
She's famous in the circle
of children's writers.

545
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:02,457
It's the story of a special child,
an immigrant

546
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:05,290
who lives on the street
and turns junk objects

547
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:09,082
into imaginary treasures
that teach him something.

548
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,040
Don't tell him the whole book.

549
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:12,874
It's a metaphor.

550
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:15,707
It's a call to all of us,

551
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:18,957
men, women, the genderless,

552
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:22,332
to live in a state
of permanent poetry,

553
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:26,165
against this ever more hostile, sick

554
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:29,374
and unjust world we live in.

555
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:32,957
I love it. Thanks a lot.

556
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:36,082
How do you know you love it
if you haven't read it yet?

557
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,915
From what she told me.

558
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:41,915
-It looks great.
-Thank you.

559
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:44,332
And it only cost you 100 euros.

560
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,499
Why?

561
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,749
Shall we go?

562
00:34:46,916 --> 00:34:50,790
<i>Did you know that the pink dolphin
is in serious danger of extinction?</i>

563
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:55,415
<i>This marvellous animal has been
devastated by the deeds of man</i>

564
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:57,332
<i>and it needs our help.</i>

565
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:59,790
<i>The pink dolphin has no voice.</i>

566
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:01,915
<i>Today I am its voice</i>

567
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:04,374
<i>and I say: it needs your help.</i>

568
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:06,999
-How pathetic. Please...
<i>-I need one euro.</i>

569
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:09,290
<i>With your contribution we can...</i>

570
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:12,540
Lola, excuse me,
the crane is ready on the terrace.

571
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:17,124
Félix will be late.
In case you want to entertain Iván.

572
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:18,332
Coming.

573
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:21,165
You must see this Félix thing.

574
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:22,624
It's dreadful.

575
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:26,915
<i>Did you know that the pink dolphin
is in serious danger of extinction?</i>

576
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:31,374
<i>This marvellous animal has been
devastated by the deeds of man</i>

577
00:35:31,541 --> 00:35:34,457
<i>and it needs our help.</i>

578
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:39,040
I'll speak in Spanish.

579
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:43,707
I must say that when I was
nominated for this award,

580
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:46,874
my first impression was distaste.

581
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:49,832
I wasn't going to come, frankly,
but then...

582
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:53,457
my family and friends
made me realize that

583
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,332
it was important to be here
to say what I think.

584
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,165
That's why I'm here before you,
to lay out my position.

585
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:05,374
I don't believe in art as spectacle

586
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:08,582
and much less
in what they call success.

587
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:13,749
Making art compete
as if it were a sports event,

588
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:16,040
I think is atrocious.

589
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:20,665
Why then have I come?

590
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,165
I've come...

591
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:27,999
to formally declare
my rejection of this award.

592
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:31,874
Thank you very much.

593
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,790
And good night.

594
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,707
Hello.

595
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:58,499
What's this?

596
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:01,999
This is about including
an external element

597
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,249
that increases the tension,
increases the fear.

598
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:09,249
It also symbolises the pressure
these two wretches live under,

599
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:10,457
the weight of the law.

600
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:12,457
I don't need that.

601
00:37:12,916 --> 00:37:15,165
It's not a need Iván,

602
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,790
it's an exercise.

603
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:20,040
Come on, it's only 5 tons.

604
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:21,790
Is this safe?

605
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:25,624
Are we ready?

606
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,540
Remember, you're talking to a judge.

607
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:40,207
That image will haunt me
my whole life.

608
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:42,124
Memories of horror.

609
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:44,915
Mum and Dad stretched out.

610
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,415
In shock, deep shock.

611
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:50,207
...amid glass and blood...

612
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:51,540
Now you hate him!

613
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:54,832
...and Manuel kneeling on
the asphalt, drunk...

614
00:37:54,979 --> 00:37:56,213
Sentence!

615
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:59,957
I didn't see my brother,
I saw my parents' killer.

616
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:03,582
-Less Iván. Relax!
-Sure, "relax", Lola, but with this...

617
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,249
Don't cut!

618
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:09,207
Let's go again.

619
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:11,999
From "I didn't see my brother".

620
00:38:12,413 --> 00:38:13,489
Action.

621
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,457
I didn't see my brother,
I saw my parents' killer.

622
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:18,224
Less.

623
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:22,915
I didn't see my brother,
I saw my parents' killer.

624
00:38:23,057 --> 00:38:25,054
-Less.
-But...

625
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:28,207
If I do any less,
I'll be doing nothing, Lola.

626
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,790
That's the idea.

627
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:34,499
-Alright, Félix...
-Yeah, yeah.

628
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:37,665
-Use it, use it.
-Yeah, yeah.

629
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:40,540
-You're terrified of the judge.
-Yes, the judge.

630
00:38:40,657 --> 00:38:41,959
Let's go.

631
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:48,249
I bear the harshest sentence,

632
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:49,939
the guilt...

633
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:52,249
-From here, from the heart.
-Yeah, yeah.

634
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,790
Say it from here.

635
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:57,374
I would rather have died

636
00:38:57,833 --> 00:38:59,082
and they lived.

637
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:00,749
-Fake, I don't believe it.
-No.

638
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:03,457
Truth, I want the truth.

639
00:39:04,223 --> 00:39:05,753
Something...

640
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:09,415
ran in front of me,
I think it was an animal or...

641
00:39:09,532 --> 00:39:11,002
Resigned.

642
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,602
An accident.

643
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,332
An accident I couldn't prevent.

644
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,707
Again. Resigned and disillusioned.

645
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:20,790
Disillusioned. Right.

646
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:26,540
An accident I couldn't prevent.

647
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:30,040
Resigned, disillusioned
and distressed.

648
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:34,874
An accident I couldn't prevent.

649
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:38,874
-That's it.
- Yes, I...

650
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:41,040
That's the way, guys.

651
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:43,582
I promise to shut up.

652
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:45,171
It's all yours.

653
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:46,337
Action.

654
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:51,582
We've done three rehearsals.
Six to go.

655
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:55,915
I never understood that.
Nine seemed like very few.

656
00:39:56,458 --> 00:40:00,165
Sorry, it's the best I can do
with my schedule.

657
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:01,624
Sure, but...

658
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:05,332
You always have to rehearse
according to what the work requires.

659
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:10,749
Sometimes rehearsing too much
can overcook the thing.

660
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:13,540
Too much, no, what's necessary.

661
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:15,499
Don't worry about it.

662
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:18,665
We're rehearsing for nine days
because that's enough.

663
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,624
Lola, sorry, you've finished
with the rock, haven't you?

664
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:38,999
-But...
-Guys, you're so gullible.

665
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:40,665
It's cardboard.

666
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:42,499
-Ready?
-Got it.

667
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:44,540
-Straight to Instagram, eh?
-Yeah, yeah.

668
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:45,707
Let's go.

669
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,415
Go, go.

670
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,624
What a wanker.

671
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:17,999
I'm sorry.

672
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:20,290
It all got terribly complicated.

673
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:21,374
The third time.

674
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:24,582
Lola, Diana is coming,
but she's with Mr Suárez.

675
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,749
You don't say.

676
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:29,374
And to what do we owe
the visit from our producer?

677
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:33,207
He's bringing his daughter Diana.
I told you she's playing the role of Lucy.

678
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:35,665
That was true?
I thought it was a joke.

679
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:39,749
He asked me, I did loads of tests
and the girl's great,

680
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:40,999
very special.

681
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:46,915
Diana, your character doesn't
have any particular interest.

682
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:49,415
She's in her place,
she goes with the flow.

683
00:41:49,583 --> 00:41:52,457
They're the ones
with the conflict. Alright?

684
00:41:52,627 --> 00:41:53,499
Okay.

685
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:57,249
I'd like to see the stamp of
Pedro and Manuel's personalities

686
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:58,515
through the kiss,

687
00:41:58,709 --> 00:42:00,749
how they kiss Lucy,

688
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,707
their individual approach.

689
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:06,415
-Do you want to start?
-Right away.

690
00:42:09,375 --> 00:42:10,874
Right, let's go.

691
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:15,290
Put the headphones on.

692
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:17,332
The sound is key here.

693
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:20,707
Hello.

694
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:21,999
Listen...

695
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:24,874
Sorry if I have an erection.

696
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:29,249
And sorry if I don't,
it's nothing personal.

697
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:32,707
-Okay. Ready?
-Yeah, yeah.

698
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:35,707
Action.

699
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,915
Okay, okay, okay.

700
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:22,874
Thank you, Félix.

701
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,499
Iván, shall we go with you?

702
00:43:27,666 --> 00:43:29,582
Good luck, champ.

703
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:36,124
Okay, let's go.

704
00:43:37,083 --> 00:43:38,290
Forgive me.

705
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:58,665
Okay, okay, okay.

706
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:01,749
The poor guy's been married
for 28 years to the same woman,

707
00:44:01,916 --> 00:44:03,999
you can tell that.

708
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:07,665
Don't you laugh,
you don't convey much either.

709
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:11,624
I have 13 international awards, eh?
I must convey something.

710
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:12,749
Just saying.

711
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,707
Oh, sure, the awards.
Yes, that's so important.

712
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:19,374
Guys, I'll show you something,
with Diana's permission.

713
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:24,707
Do you mind?

714
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:28,999
Look.

715
00:45:40,958 --> 00:45:43,150
I forgot something at work.

716
00:45:43,352 --> 00:45:44,874
I have to go.

717
00:45:45,583 --> 00:45:47,499
It's all fantastic.

718
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:51,957
My girl...

719
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,457
Excellent.

720
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:57,290
Tell me about it later.

721
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:05,207
So the idea is to fly
on Tuesday the 21st.

722
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:06,790
In the morning, early.

723
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:09,082
Excuse me.

724
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:11,582
Lola, yes?

725
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,499
Yes.

726
00:46:14,958 --> 00:46:16,249
Fine, I'll put it on speaker.

727
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:18,124
It's Lola.

728
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:21,332
<i>Hi, guys, how are you?</i>

729
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,624
<i>I wanted to ask you a favour.</i>

730
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:27,999
<i>Maybe the next day you could
bring some of your awards.</i>

731
00:46:29,791 --> 00:46:32,124
Hi, Lola, it's Félix.

732
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:35,082
Do you mean the trophies,
the statues?

733
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:39,707
<i>Yes, some of the 35 you said.
Whatever's easy.</i>

734
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:44,165
<i>We'll be doing an exercise
with them, okay?</i>

735
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:45,874
-Okay.
-Great. See you later.

736
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:47,332
<i>See you later. Great.</i>

737
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,249
Good, let's resume.

738
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:52,832
I was saying that we'd leave
early on the 21st

739
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,790
and we'd be just over a week

740
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:58,249
until the final scenes
and some exteriors.

741
00:46:58,458 --> 00:47:01,124
-Exactly seven working days.
-Yes, as long as it doesn't rain.

742
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:04,374
One thing.
When I travel, I always get

743
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:08,582
the cheapest ticket,
never first class.

744
00:47:08,916 --> 00:47:11,082
Take that into account, please.
It's important.

745
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:12,249
Why?

746
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:13,957
It's an ethical question.

747
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:15,290
Ethical?

748
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:18,832
I hate being forced
to have privileges.

749
00:47:19,041 --> 00:47:22,124
Besides, when I get on the plane
and pass through first class,

750
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:26,790
I check out the turd
and shitbird faces up front.

751
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:29,999
Iván, I like you more every day.

752
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,249
-I have to go. I have classes.
-Fine.

753
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,832
Sorry I'd like to comment
briefly on Félix's food.

754
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,082
Let's see...

755
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:46,832
It has to be macrobiotic,
ecological,

756
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,457
gluten-free, all made in Spain.

757
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,249
Félix.

758
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,665
Félix.

759
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:09,124
Félix.

760
00:48:16,041 --> 00:48:17,249
Félix.

761
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:21,874
Félix!

762
00:48:26,625 --> 00:48:27,874
Félix!

763
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:31,582
Félix!

764
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:35,457
Félix!

765
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,249
Félix!

766
00:48:41,666 --> 00:48:43,249
Cool, I like it.

767
00:48:43,416 --> 00:48:44,582
Yeah, yeah.

768
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:23,999
I'm starting to worry
because this isn't it.

769
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:25,249
This isn't it.

770
00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:29,374
Where are the sofa fabrics
I approved the other day?

771
00:49:29,916 --> 00:49:31,082
Here.

772
00:49:32,458 --> 00:49:34,249
Look, this is it.

773
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:36,040
This one, this one.

774
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:37,207
Not this one.

775
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:38,957
See the difference?

776
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:41,290
-Yes, I think so.
-You see?

777
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:46,457
The curtains are from the house
of a simple, small-town guy.

778
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,749
Yes, he has money,
but we have to imagine

779
00:49:48,916 --> 00:49:52,832
what he thinks is refined,
a rough, unrefined guy.

780
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,665
What does he think is refined?
Not the art director. Got it?

781
00:49:56,833 --> 00:50:00,201
I've got it.
It's about this man's aspiration.

782
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:01,540
-Exactly.
-Lola.

783
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:05,582
Iván should've come half an hour ago.
I've called him three tiroes.

784
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,582
-Call from my phone.
-Yes.

785
00:50:07,791 --> 00:50:08,874
Well, Susana, that's it.

786
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:13,124
Check the notes, that's why I spent
seven hours looking at fabrics.

787
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:20,415
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Iván, hello.

788
00:50:20,916 --> 00:50:22,915
<i>-Lola?</i>
-No, it's Julia.

789
00:50:23,083 --> 00:50:25,915
I'm calling from Lola's mobile,
my battery's run out.

790
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:26,832
<i>Sure.</i>

791
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,457
Iván, you do remember
that we start at 2 o'clock?

792
00:50:29,666 --> 00:50:31,499
Yes, it's in my diary,

793
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:34,374
but since I was made to wait
in the last rehearsal

794
00:50:34,541 --> 00:50:36,915
and the one before,

795
00:50:37,291 --> 00:50:39,499
etcetera, etcetera,

796
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:42,207
today I'll make them wait
two hours to make up for it.

797
00:50:42,416 --> 00:50:43,957
And I'm charging for it.

798
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,540
I'll see you at 4 pm.

799
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:48,332
I'll be on time.

800
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:07,540
Sorry.

801
00:51:07,708 --> 00:51:08,915
It's...

802
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:13,374
a series about an astronaut.

803
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:16,081
On the way back in a spaceship,

804
00:51:16,291 --> 00:51:19,207
he lands on an island
inhabited by savages

805
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:22,249
who've never had any contact
with civilization.

806
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:24,082
I play the astronaut.

807
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,040
How awful.

808
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:28,915
It's so bad, it could be great, eh?

809
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:32,624
-Mark my words.
-Yes, great.

810
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:43,124
This is nice.

811
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:47,082
What a waste.
Nobody's ever used it.

812
00:51:47,541 --> 00:51:51,249
For a pharmaceutical congress,
at the very most.

813
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:58,165
These are just some of them.

814
00:51:58,708 --> 00:52:02,332
From right to left,
the San Sebastián Silver Shell,

815
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,249
two Golden Globes,

816
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:07,249
the Volpi Cup from the Venice festival,

817
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,624
and two of my five Goyas.

818
00:52:09,791 --> 00:52:11,915
The other three
are in my home in Saint-Tropez.

819
00:52:12,166 --> 00:52:15,040
The rest are in
the Los Angeles house.

820
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,707
-A lot.
-Why did you make us bring them?

821
00:52:18,416 --> 00:52:20,999
We're going to do
a little thing with them.

822
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:22,707
Yours, Iván?

823
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:26,624
I don't have nearly as many.

824
00:52:26,807 --> 00:52:29,832
Obviously, I must be
a much worse actor.

825
00:52:30,958 --> 00:52:34,624
The Medal for Excellence
in the Performing Arts,

826
00:52:35,625 --> 00:52:37,457
a Max Award...

827
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:42,124
And this is the most important of all.

828
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:47,624
I was given it at a school
for disabled children.

829
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:49,832
I went to teach the kids there.

830
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,415
They made it themselves.

831
00:52:51,666 --> 00:52:54,707
A beautiful experience.

832
00:52:54,875 --> 00:52:56,707
-Shall we start?
-Yes, let's start.

833
00:53:16,958 --> 00:53:19,415
Trust, trust, guys.

834
00:53:21,875 --> 00:53:24,790
I want you to lose
all autonomy, all of it.

835
00:53:25,791 --> 00:53:28,540
One is anchored to the other,
and vice versa.

836
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:30,165
There are two of them.

837
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:35,124
Two, but subordinate
to a single path.

838
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:37,665
They are two, but with one "I".

839
00:53:37,833 --> 00:53:41,165
With a deformed "I",
it's deformed.

840
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:45,957
It's one of the things I like most
about the novel, if not <i>the</i> most.

841
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,290
The body as an enclosure,

842
00:53:51,125 --> 00:53:53,374
a prison and a sentence,

843
00:53:54,875 --> 00:53:58,832
where the skin is merely
a casing, a vessel.

844
00:53:59,958 --> 00:54:01,207
One.

845
00:54:02,541 --> 00:54:03,832
One only.

846
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:14,665
Curtain!

847
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,374
No! No!

848
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:59,457
Fucking bitch!

849
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:03,249
No, Lola!

850
00:55:06,333 --> 00:55:08,165
Not that, no!

851
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:22,124
No!

852
00:55:24,125 --> 00:55:25,207
No!

853
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:32,082
No, not that, please!

854
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:39,540
Fucking bitch!

855
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:44,624
Not that!

856
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:48,332
Not that!

857
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,249
Not that!

858
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:55,749
No!

859
00:55:56,208 --> 00:55:57,207
No, no!

860
00:55:58,291 --> 00:55:59,290
No!

861
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:05,040
Lola, no!

862
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:09,832
My Silver Lion for Best Director

863
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,124
and my Palme d'Or
for Best Picture.

864
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,582
Fuck it.

865
00:56:23,583 --> 00:56:26,874
Well, it seems the awards
we're good for something.

866
00:56:28,458 --> 00:56:29,624
Gentlemen,

867
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:33,124
an exercise on the ego.

868
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:35,540
What is she doing, the bitch?!

869
00:56:35,708 --> 00:56:39,582
Guys, 15 minutes break
and we go to 63.

870
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:41,665
Take it easy, Félix!

871
00:56:41,958 --> 00:56:45,332
Give me one reason,
one, to justify what you did!

872
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:48,249
Why the fucking hell
did you do that?

873
00:56:48,416 --> 00:56:50,790
-To transform.
-Do you know what it means to us?

874
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:53,290
To transform, that's the reason.
It transforms.

875
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:56,165
Transform... I'll turn your face
into a Picasso!

876
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:57,249
Take it easy, Félix.

877
00:56:57,458 --> 00:57:00,540
-That was nuts. We'll talk about this.
-Whenever you like, Iván.

878
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:01,957
She's crazy.

879
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:05,874
I'm sending a stack of lawyers!

880
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:07,874
I'm so scared.
Give them my address.

881
00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:11,540
-4310 Segurola and La Habana, 7th floor.
-They'll be there!

882
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:03,582
Félix's lawyers demand that
the destroyed awards are replaced

883
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:06,749
and their client reimbursed
for non-material damages.

884
01:00:06,916 --> 01:00:08,957
Fuck, "non-material damages"...

885
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:09,915
Let's see?

886
01:00:10,166 --> 01:00:14,249
Duplicates of the six you destroyed
comes to 83,000 euros.

887
01:00:14,416 --> 01:00:17,957
I don't care, they can work it out
with the producer, not me.

888
01:00:18,583 --> 01:00:21,332
The catering people are here.
You asked to try the food...

889
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:24,499
-No, don't depress me with that today.
-Fine.

890
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:28,915
The day I got out,
I wanted to go back to jail.

891
01:00:29,333 --> 01:00:30,790
No, no.

892
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:32,624
-What?
-No.

893
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:33,790
Don't look at him.

894
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:34,832
Don't look at him,

895
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,957
and when you do, at the end,

896
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:40,374
I want you to bore into him
with your look, to see his soul.

897
01:00:40,541 --> 01:00:41,582
Again.

898
01:00:44,541 --> 01:00:45,624
Action.

899
01:00:47,416 --> 01:00:49,082
The day I...

900
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,207
No.

901
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:52,540
No, no, no.

902
01:00:52,708 --> 01:00:53,374
But...

903
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:57,874
Look, Lola, I've made
over a hundred films,

904
01:00:58,125 --> 01:01:02,082
and you're going to tell me
how to do my fucking job?

905
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:03,665
Don't fuck with me.

906
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:05,082
Let me do the scene once,

907
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:09,540
and if you don't like it,
you come and do it, eh, cutie?

908
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:11,790
Sorry.

909
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:14,832
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

910
01:01:17,083 --> 01:01:18,290
Excuse me.

911
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:21,832
Excuse me, Lola.
You too, Iván, I'm sorry.

912
01:01:22,083 --> 01:01:22,665
Sorry.

913
01:01:22,833 --> 01:01:25,374
Félix, I'm sorry,
but I have to believe it.

914
01:01:25,541 --> 01:01:27,915
No, no, it's just...

915
01:01:29,958 --> 01:01:32,124
I'm upset about a personal matter.

916
01:01:32,291 --> 01:01:34,040
It's my problem

917
01:01:34,208 --> 01:01:36,957
and I took it out on you.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

918
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:39,915
Did you fight with your new call girl?

919
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:42,665
Okay, it's fine,
we all have bad days.

920
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:43,915
Yes.

921
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:47,665
-From the top.
-Lola, Lola, wait. Iván...

922
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:52,457
I have something to tell you.

923
01:01:53,875 --> 01:01:56,790
It's very hard to say,

924
01:01:56,958 --> 01:01:59,665
but I think you both should know.

925
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:02,290
It turns out...

926
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:04,874
I don't want to shake you up.

927
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:09,665
If there's anything I don't want,
it's to be pitied.

928
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:13,082
First of all, I'm fine,

929
01:02:13,708 --> 01:02:17,124
as well as one can be
under the circumstances.

930
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:19,749
Anyway...

931
01:02:19,916 --> 01:02:22,749
I'd better get to the point,
come straight out with it.

932
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:25,499
Earlier this month

933
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:28,999
I had a medical check-up and...

934
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:31,374
the results weren't good.

935
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:35,082
Not good at all.

936
01:02:36,666 --> 01:02:39,332
Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

937
01:02:40,916 --> 01:02:42,249
Cancer.

938
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:44,540
And...

939
01:02:45,541 --> 01:02:49,874
the prognosis isn't encouraging.

940
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:53,082
I have to have more tests,

941
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:56,249
but if they confirm
what seems to be...

942
01:02:56,958 --> 01:02:58,415
a fact,

943
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:01,415
I have at most a year left.

944
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:08,832
But...

945
01:03:10,833 --> 01:03:12,790
Is there no treatment?

946
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:17,665
Yes, but it's very invasive and...

947
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:20,374
I decided not to do anything.

948
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:22,874
I'm just on palliatives.

949
01:03:25,083 --> 01:03:27,832
I haven't cancelled any project.

950
01:03:28,208 --> 01:03:31,249
I'm carrying on with
my normal life while I can.

951
01:03:35,583 --> 01:03:36,832
I want...

952
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:40,665
I want death to catch me
living my life.

953
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:49,290
Lola, Iván, I want my last film
to be a great film.

954
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:53,499
And I'm going to do my utmost,

955
01:03:53,666 --> 01:03:55,290
absolutely.

956
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,915
Maybe I can even channel
this painful experience

957
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:05,207
to nourish my character.

958
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:09,707
Count on my help
for whatever you want.

959
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:12,374
Thank you.

960
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:17,374
We're going to make
a fucking great film.

961
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:25,124
Forgive my mood swings
and these outbursts, but...

962
01:04:25,333 --> 01:04:27,957
this medication has got me...

963
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:29,999
kind of crazy.

964
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:32,749
Everything disturbs me and...

965
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:19,165
Julia.

966
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:21,749
Can you hear me?

967
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:28,999
What I'm going to tell you
is between us, okay?

968
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,957
Félix is sick. He has cancer.

969
01:05:35,458 --> 01:05:38,290
Yes, awful. He told us today.

970
01:05:38,458 --> 01:05:40,249
He hasn't long to live.

971
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:44,499
So we have to shoot sooner.

972
01:05:44,666 --> 01:05:46,249
Yes, two weeks.

973
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,249
Yes, yes, sure we can.

974
01:05:49,416 --> 01:05:51,874
We have to start on the 21st.

975
01:05:52,541 --> 01:05:54,957
I don't know, nor do I care.

976
01:05:55,166 --> 01:05:58,124
PANCREATIC CANCER:
WHY IS IT THE DEADLIEST?

977
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:14,374
DENTAL BLEACHING

978
01:06:54,375 --> 01:06:58,665
Losing one of your actors
as soon as you start shooting.

979
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:03,790
What a disaster.

980
01:07:04,416 --> 01:07:07,457
How was I to know
he was going through all this?

981
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:10,790
He looks fine,
always full of energy.

982
01:07:11,041 --> 01:07:12,874
It's horrible, yes.

983
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:14,624
It's really tough.

984
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:19,624
And it's a nasty cancer.

985
01:07:20,416 --> 01:07:23,124
And I'm demanding so much
from you, so much...

986
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:26,832
Have I treated you so badly?

987
01:07:28,666 --> 01:07:30,874
You didn't know.

988
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:37,332
It doesn't matter,
I'm a goddamn monster.

989
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:40,749
It's because I suffer,
I suffer a lot with my films.

990
01:07:40,916 --> 01:07:44,499
I tried to do it differently,
but I can't. I don't know.

991
01:07:46,166 --> 01:07:47,540
Lola, sorry.

992
01:07:47,708 --> 01:07:50,374
Félix's mobile is off.
He's half an hour late.

993
01:07:50,625 --> 01:07:52,707
Don't call him again, my God.

994
01:07:57,375 --> 01:07:59,957
Poor guy must be with the doctors.

995
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:05,207
What the fuck do we do now?

996
01:08:10,416 --> 01:08:13,040
Lola, I want to
tell you something because...

997
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:17,249
I keep thinking about it too.

998
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:20,707
If it gets worse...

999
01:08:20,875 --> 01:08:24,749
We hope not, of course,
we hope not.

1000
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,582
But if Félix can't go on,

1001
01:08:31,666 --> 01:08:34,915
I could play both roles.

1002
01:08:37,875 --> 01:08:40,540
Two brothers,
one with a beard,

1003
01:08:40,708 --> 01:08:42,874
the other without a beard...

1004
01:08:43,541 --> 01:08:45,415
Or they could be twins.

1005
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:47,957
Why not?

1006
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:49,790
Whatever.

1007
01:08:54,208 --> 01:08:56,290
It's an idea, that's all.

1008
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:10,124
Oh, this stress.

1009
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:15,374
My whole body hurts.

1010
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:18,832
Squeeze a bit there,
please, my neck.

1011
01:09:25,125 --> 01:09:27,790
-Harder.
-Yes, hold on.

1012
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:30,249
Harder.

1013
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:34,249
Life is so hard sometimes.

1014
01:10:00,916 --> 01:10:03,249
Félix, how are you, honey?

1015
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:05,415
It's all fine, fine.

1016
01:10:06,416 --> 01:10:07,790
Did you rest up?

1017
01:10:07,958 --> 01:10:11,082
Yes, I had a tiny domestic problem.

1018
01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:14,415
I was arguing with my ex-wife
all morning

1019
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:18,249
because the bitch wants to stay
in my house in Saint-Tropez.

1020
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:19,582
Do you know Saint-Tropez?

1021
01:10:20,208 --> 01:10:21,915
Beautiful beaches.

1022
01:10:22,083 --> 01:10:23,832
Great nightlife too.

1023
01:10:25,625 --> 01:10:29,040
But she knows about
your disease, right?

1024
01:10:30,291 --> 01:10:31,457
What disease?

1025
01:10:31,833 --> 01:10:34,082
Oh, no, no... the cancer thing?

1026
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:36,249
No, she doesn't because...

1027
01:10:36,541 --> 01:10:38,124
it's a lie.

1028
01:10:38,583 --> 01:10:39,582
It's a lie.

1029
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:43,832
How can I be sick?
Just look at me.

1030
01:10:44,041 --> 01:10:45,665
I did it as...

1031
01:10:46,166 --> 01:10:48,249
a performance for you two,

1032
01:10:48,416 --> 01:10:52,124
a little acting demonstration.

1033
01:11:16,916 --> 01:11:18,415
So intense.

1034
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:20,832
You do realize, right?

1035
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:23,332
You don't play with that.
You son of a bitch.

1036
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,749
A son of a bitch...

1037
01:11:26,291 --> 01:11:28,374
but a great actor too, clearly,

1038
01:11:28,541 --> 01:11:31,540
because you bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

1039
01:11:38,916 --> 01:11:40,957
You destroyed something
very fragile, Félix.

1040
01:11:41,125 --> 01:11:42,999
You destroyed it.

1041
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:45,124
And you destroyed those awards.

1042
01:11:45,291 --> 01:11:47,040
-Don't speak.
-Huh?

1043
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:48,665
Don't say anything.

1044
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,499
Lola, what happened?

1045
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:56,457
I can have a ton of things
going around my mind,

1046
01:11:56,595 --> 01:11:59,999
and it works perfectly,
despite the chaos.

1047
01:12:00,166 --> 01:12:04,124
Now this absurd, childish thing
between you two comes up,

1048
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:06,582
and it's like a rock to the head,

1049
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:09,540
I go into a kind of blackout.

1050
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:11,832
Fuck, you're getting to know me

1051
01:12:12,041 --> 01:12:14,915
and you know that
I'm very, very sensitive.

1052
01:12:15,166 --> 01:12:16,499
Is it a gift? Yes.

1053
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:19,915
Do I have a hard time?
Yes, I do!

1054
01:12:21,208 --> 01:12:25,540
Is this about whose dick is bigger,
who is more macho?

1055
01:12:25,916 --> 01:12:28,124
No, Lola, it's not.

1056
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:31,624
In my case, I can assure you
that it's not like that.

1057
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:34,040
Look, however...

1058
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,290
out of place, stupid,
even unpleasant

1059
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:41,249
what Félix did may be,

1060
01:12:42,666 --> 01:12:44,749
I mean... well...

1061
01:12:44,916 --> 01:12:47,040
There's competition,

1062
01:12:47,208 --> 01:12:48,665
there always is.

1063
01:12:48,833 --> 01:12:51,290
But in this case the situation,

1064
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:54,207
and I want to make this clear,

1065
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:56,249
it's objective,

1066
01:12:57,708 --> 01:12:59,332
it's reality,

1067
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:02,124
it can't be concealed.

1068
01:13:02,458 --> 01:13:07,332
It's easy to see which one
of us has the most talent.

1069
01:13:08,708 --> 01:13:09,790
Come here.

1070
01:13:10,833 --> 01:13:14,832
Come over here.
It's good for you to hear too.

1071
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:19,207
I'm saying that one
can tell very clearly

1072
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:21,374
who is the better actor

1073
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:24,082
between Félix and me.

1074
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:25,832
And it's Félix.

1075
01:13:26,083 --> 01:13:29,999
Félix is a better actor than I am.

1076
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:32,832
You know how to reach...

1077
01:13:34,041 --> 01:13:37,249
the audience, the people,
the real people.

1078
01:13:37,541 --> 01:13:39,582
On the other hand, I chose...

1079
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,749
to believe I was prestigious.

1080
01:13:42,916 --> 01:13:46,832
I fooled myself, I told myself that
the audience wasn't at the level

1081
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:50,249
of what I was doing.

1082
01:13:52,041 --> 01:13:53,165
Horrible.

1083
01:13:53,625 --> 01:13:56,457
A whole career based

1084
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:58,915
on a false doctrine,

1085
01:13:59,625 --> 01:14:02,874
comfortable and fake,
which is even worse.

1086
01:14:04,625 --> 01:14:07,457
And I ended up realising,
working here with you,

1087
01:14:07,708 --> 01:14:10,374
and it's what I owe you,

1088
01:14:11,541 --> 01:14:15,874
that true artistic daring
lives in moving

1089
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:19,707
the common people,
the common audience.

1090
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:23,874
And that's tremendously hard,
extremely hard.

1091
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:26,249
Félix does it,

1092
01:14:27,875 --> 01:14:29,790
hats off, like no one else.

1093
01:14:30,125 --> 01:14:31,207
Like the best.

1094
01:14:31,416 --> 01:14:33,332
You're the master.

1095
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,915
I have to tell you that.

1096
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,207
Iván, I don't...

1097
01:14:40,666 --> 01:14:43,957
I'm very grateful
for your words, really.

1098
01:14:44,791 --> 01:14:48,249
For someone with your career
to speak like that...

1099
01:14:49,416 --> 01:14:51,999
You're the master of acting,

1100
01:14:52,166 --> 01:14:54,624
and for me what you said

1101
01:14:54,791 --> 01:14:57,249
is better than any award.

1102
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:01,457
Lola, I'll always be
grateful to you

1103
01:15:01,625 --> 01:15:04,332
that you had the idea
to put us together.

1104
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:10,665
I must say that I also had
a lot of prejudices against you.

1105
01:15:11,041 --> 01:15:14,582
The great master,
the one who knows the most...

1106
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:18,249
But I've seen that
you're all that and more.

1107
01:15:19,083 --> 01:15:21,749
An actor in capital letters.

1108
01:15:22,875 --> 01:15:25,374
And I'm sure that this film

1109
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:28,499
will see you recognised
by the general public.

1110
01:15:29,333 --> 01:15:30,415
Yes, sir.

1111
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:35,165
I was returning the courtesy, Félix.

1112
01:15:36,666 --> 01:15:37,999
I was acting.

1113
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:40,457
You believed it, eh? I got you.

1114
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:42,290
The general public

1115
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:46,957
is a mass of ignorant,
passive people with no ideas,

1116
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:48,415
and actors like you

1117
01:15:49,166 --> 01:15:53,332
leave the audience
even more stultified.

1118
01:15:54,541 --> 01:15:56,415
And you always give them
the same thing.

1119
01:15:56,583 --> 01:15:59,249
Pure banal entertainment,

1120
01:15:59,416 --> 01:16:02,999
which doesn't even entertain me,
incidentally.

1121
01:16:03,166 --> 01:16:06,082
That's what I really think.

1122
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:08,165
Sorry, Lola, sorry.

1123
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:09,790
Forgive me.

1124
01:16:10,333 --> 01:16:12,999
One-all. We're tied.

1125
01:16:18,333 --> 01:16:19,582
That's true.

1126
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:22,124
No one likes how I act.

1127
01:16:22,291 --> 01:16:23,624
Except the audience.

1128
01:16:23,791 --> 01:16:25,165
No less.

1129
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:28,124
-Julia, when's the next rehearsal?
-Thursday.

1130
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:29,540
Thursday.

1131
01:16:31,083 --> 01:16:33,082
Good, because I can't
handle you two anymore.

1132
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:34,540
No rehearsal today.

1133
01:16:34,708 --> 01:16:36,290
Until Thursday.

1134
01:16:41,958 --> 01:16:43,457
Amazing.

1135
01:16:43,916 --> 01:16:45,832
I totally believed it.

1136
01:16:46,791 --> 01:16:48,707
You as an audience believed it,

1137
01:16:48,875 --> 01:16:52,457
but I believed it first,
do you understand?

1138
01:16:52,625 --> 01:16:53,332
Sure.

1139
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,957
I have to believe it
so that you do.

1140
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:58,499
I never tire of telling my students:

1141
01:16:58,666 --> 01:17:03,207
It's not about repeating the text,
but thinking like the character.

1142
01:17:03,375 --> 01:17:05,207
If you think like the character,

1143
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:08,957
if you've captured
the mind of the character,

1144
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:11,165
the rest comes by itself.

1145
01:17:11,333 --> 01:17:12,665
It's as simple

1146
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:15,207
and as complex as that.

1147
01:17:15,375 --> 01:17:16,415
Excuse me.

1148
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:20,999
YOU'RE FIRED YOU IDIOT

1149
01:17:21,166 --> 01:17:22,665
Is something wrong?

1150
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:31,624
Excuse me.

1151
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:33,790
Félix, Iván,

1152
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:36,165
Lola just told me she's not coming.

1153
01:18:36,375 --> 01:18:38,582
I'll read the message.

1154
01:18:38,916 --> 01:18:43,249
"Tell them this is today's rehearsal,
the experience of coming in vain.

1155
01:18:43,583 --> 01:18:46,415
This question mark,
the void of the unforeseen,

1156
01:18:46,583 --> 01:18:49,249
will make them think
about themselves.

1157
01:18:49,416 --> 01:18:51,165
I'll see them on Tuesday."

1158
01:18:52,791 --> 01:18:53,874
Sorry.

1159
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:58,999
Holy shit, man.

1160
01:18:59,166 --> 01:19:01,249
Holy shit.

1161
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:05,165
Let's not give this nutcase
the satisfaction of a comment.

1162
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,249
What a bitch.

1163
01:19:07,958 --> 01:19:10,040
Goddamn bitch.

1164
01:19:11,416 --> 01:19:12,290
Fucking bitch!

1165
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:38,457
-Wonderful.
-Yes, it's great, great.

1166
01:19:38,625 --> 01:19:43,415
Listen to that texture,
the dirt in the background.

1167
01:19:43,583 --> 01:19:44,624
Can you hear it?

1168
01:19:44,791 --> 01:19:46,665
Like a latent...

1169
01:19:46,833 --> 01:19:49,499
Yes. Very dense.

1170
01:19:49,791 --> 01:19:51,124
And now..

1171
01:19:52,541 --> 01:19:54,707
Now it goes to the limit.

1172
01:20:00,541 --> 01:20:02,249
Where is he from?

1173
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:05,332
He's Canadian,
but he lives in Düsseldorf.

1174
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,415
He's a performer as well.

1175
01:20:10,708 --> 01:20:15,082
These sounds fascinate me,
that timeless, tribal banging.

1176
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:16,582
Listen.

1177
01:20:19,958 --> 01:20:21,957
No, no, I think...

1178
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:24,832
I think it's...

1179
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:29,540
the man next door
nailing something.

1180
01:20:31,791 --> 01:20:33,790
Yes, it's him, fuck it.

1181
01:20:40,125 --> 01:20:41,749
Misunderstood.

1182
01:20:43,291 --> 01:20:44,790
Lesbian.

1183
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:47,874
Pretentious.

1184
01:20:48,166 --> 01:20:49,540
Depraved.

1185
01:20:50,875 --> 01:20:52,082
Cruel.

1186
01:20:53,958 --> 01:20:56,165
Whore. Whore.

1187
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:58,832
Girl.

1188
01:20:59,583 --> 01:21:00,832
Girl.

1189
01:21:03,541 --> 01:21:04,790
Alone.

1190
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:07,749
Alone.

1191
01:21:10,833 --> 01:21:13,332
Terrified. Terrified.

1192
01:21:15,166 --> 01:21:16,249
Genius.

1193
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:20,082
Jerk.

1194
01:21:21,125 --> 01:21:22,290
Crazy.

1195
01:21:24,208 --> 01:21:25,332
Crazy.

1196
01:21:26,583 --> 01:21:27,874
You're crazy.

1197
01:21:28,833 --> 01:21:31,749
Ridiculous.

1198
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:36,165
Ridiculous.

1199
01:21:36,333 --> 01:21:39,290
Sorry, I didn't want to interrupt,
but they're ready.

1200
01:21:40,083 --> 01:21:42,124
What, what? What now?

1201
01:21:42,291 --> 01:21:43,582
They're set.

1202
01:21:46,375 --> 01:21:49,374
Not one fucking moment
to myself, really!

1203
01:21:49,541 --> 01:21:51,957
Not a single one.

1204
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:53,582
Idiot!

1205
01:21:53,833 --> 01:21:54,790
Ignoramus!

1206
01:21:54,958 --> 01:21:56,540
Son of a bitch!

1207
01:21:56,708 --> 01:21:57,499
Prick!

1208
01:21:57,666 --> 01:21:58,957
Ass kisser!

1209
01:21:59,125 --> 01:22:00,290
Go fuck yourself!

1210
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,124
Double fuck yourself!

1211
01:22:03,291 --> 01:22:04,332
Fathead, filth!

1212
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:05,332
Bastard!

1213
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:06,332
Scumbag!

1214
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,457
Shit eater!

1215
01:22:07,625 --> 01:22:08,374
Leech!

1216
01:22:08,541 --> 01:22:10,249
I shit on your teeth!

1217
01:22:10,416 --> 01:22:12,874
Double fuck your mother!

1218
01:22:13,125 --> 01:22:15,415
Triple fuck your fucking mother!

1219
01:22:15,583 --> 01:22:16,624
Nutjob!

1220
01:22:16,791 --> 01:22:17,582
Abortion!

1221
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:20,124
Son of a truckful of bitches!

1222
01:22:21,541 --> 01:22:26,374
I shit on the ass crack
and pussy of your fucking mother!

1223
01:22:26,625 --> 01:22:29,957
Fuck your mother!
I shit on your mother's face!

1224
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:31,332
Not me.

1225
01:22:31,583 --> 01:22:33,124
Not me, Iván Torres.

1226
01:22:33,291 --> 01:22:37,082
I shit on the whole Torres family,

1227
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:38,915
on the Torres of the past,

1228
01:22:39,166 --> 01:22:40,540
the present

1229
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:42,457
and of the future!

1230
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:43,790
On all the Torres!

1231
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:45,290
Félix Rivero,

1232
01:22:45,458 --> 01:22:49,665
if there wasn't a lady present,
I'd beat the living shit out of you.

1233
01:22:49,833 --> 01:22:51,290
Right, that's enough.

1234
01:22:51,625 --> 01:22:55,374
It was just an exercise
to warm up for rehearsal.

1235
01:22:55,541 --> 01:22:57,499
-That's enough.
-Take it easy.

1236
01:22:57,666 --> 01:23:01,457
I'd never hit an old man
clearly in inferior shape.

1237
01:23:01,625 --> 01:23:03,415
So speaks the kid
who's a slave to money.

1238
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:05,499
You're a slave too,
but for less money.

1239
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:06,957
Enough, enough.

1240
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:09,624
We rehearse in 15.
Let's go, guys.

1241
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:13,124
Look, this is Pedro's house.

1242
01:23:13,291 --> 01:23:15,915
Here, he's having dinner with Lucy
when Manuel arrives.

1243
01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:16,915
Perfect.

1244
01:23:17,083 --> 01:23:20,249
And all this is the fields outside.

1245
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:25,415
There, where the door is,
is the foundry.

1246
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:26,665
Excellent.

1247
01:23:27,416 --> 01:23:31,665
And here, in this spot,
you two stop for the ending.

1248
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:33,124
Got it. Good, good.

1249
01:23:33,333 --> 01:23:35,499
All this minimalism.

1250
01:23:36,375 --> 01:23:40,374
It takes me back to
my beginnings, in the 60s.

1251
01:23:40,833 --> 01:23:45,540
Laboratory Theatre,
this is older than...

1252
01:23:46,833 --> 01:23:49,457
I don't know if it's useful
to rehearse like this, but...

1253
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:50,957
It's useful to me.

1254
01:23:51,125 --> 01:23:53,249
Exactly, it's useful.

1255
01:23:53,875 --> 01:23:56,040
Guys, this is the most complex,

1256
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:58,999
the biggest scene in the film,
so, concentration.

1257
01:23:59,166 --> 01:24:00,499
Come on, let's do it.

1258
01:24:00,666 --> 01:24:03,165
-Diana, are you ready?
-Lucy is ready.

1259
01:24:03,916 --> 01:24:06,624
One thing, Iván.

1260
01:24:08,208 --> 01:24:11,582
Did you do something to your teeth?
They're very white.

1261
01:24:12,458 --> 01:24:13,374
No.

1262
01:24:13,541 --> 01:24:15,520
Okay, nobody interrupts
the rehearsal but me.

1263
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,415
No one cuts for any reason.

1264
01:24:17,583 --> 01:24:19,999
I want a full take, okay?

1265
01:24:20,333 --> 01:24:23,374
People, this is the final scene.

1266
01:24:23,541 --> 01:24:25,499
Julia, lights, please.

1267
01:24:26,625 --> 01:24:27,957
Focus.

1268
01:24:29,666 --> 01:24:30,749
Action.

1269
01:24:46,541 --> 01:24:48,290
You hesitate for a second.

1270
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:09,999
Hello.

1271
01:25:11,333 --> 01:25:12,749
I need to talk to you.

1272
01:25:12,916 --> 01:25:16,249
Impossible. I'm about to
have dinner with my wife.

1273
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:17,749
Please.

1274
01:25:18,125 --> 01:25:19,374
I can't take any more.

1275
01:25:19,625 --> 01:25:23,290
I need to talk to you,
even if it's for the last time.

1276
01:25:23,458 --> 01:25:24,832
-Mum and Dad...
-Don't even say their names.

1277
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,582
Please, please.

1278
01:25:26,875 --> 01:25:29,790
Iván, you hesitate, but give in.

1279
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:32,457
Lucy.

1280
01:25:34,291 --> 01:25:38,540
I'll be back in a few minutes
and we'll have dinner.

1281
01:25:42,166 --> 01:25:45,832
-Let's get away from the house.
-Yes, that's better.

1282
01:25:48,875 --> 01:25:53,249
Even if it's too late,
I wanted to apologise to you.

1283
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:56,540
Hold it there.

1284
01:25:57,083 --> 01:25:59,665
I always competed with you.

1285
01:25:59,833 --> 01:26:03,874
And you always protected me,
almost like a father.

1286
01:26:04,916 --> 01:26:07,249
Now you've started a family
with Lucy

1287
01:26:07,458 --> 01:26:12,332
and I'm sure she's made
the best choice.

1288
01:26:16,083 --> 01:26:18,249
There's nothing...

1289
01:26:18,958 --> 01:26:21,874
Not everything
can be expressed in words.

1290
01:26:23,291 --> 01:26:24,957
I just want to...

1291
01:26:26,416 --> 01:26:28,082
tell you I'm sorry...

1292
01:26:29,166 --> 01:26:30,665
for everything.

1293
01:26:31,208 --> 01:26:33,582
Manuel, you paid your debt.

1294
01:26:34,791 --> 01:26:36,332
That's all over.

1295
01:26:38,041 --> 01:26:40,582
And it was crystal clear that...

1296
01:26:41,666 --> 01:26:44,249
you had no bad intentions.

1297
01:26:45,083 --> 01:26:49,457
Don't think it was easy for me
to testify against you.

1298
01:26:51,291 --> 01:26:54,624
Maybe it was my way...

1299
01:26:54,791 --> 01:26:58,207
of putting the pain somewhere.

1300
01:27:02,916 --> 01:27:06,249
The truth is that,
whatever happens,

1301
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,582
we're brothers.

1302
01:27:12,458 --> 01:27:13,707
They hug.

1303
01:27:16,416 --> 01:27:18,874
Turn, turn, turn.

1304
01:27:21,458 --> 01:27:22,415
Now!

1305
01:27:39,458 --> 01:27:41,040
Let's see who's in charge now.

1306
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:43,707
Now drag him to the foundry.

1307
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,915
And you put him in the oven.

1308
01:28:23,333 --> 01:28:25,207
He transforms.

1309
01:28:27,666 --> 01:28:29,207
Glasses.

1310
01:28:34,458 --> 01:28:35,749
Cap.

1311
01:28:44,791 --> 01:28:47,665
That's it.
The complete mutation.

1312
01:28:48,458 --> 01:28:52,790
Now you go home
as if nothing's happened.

1313
01:29:02,291 --> 01:29:04,374
Here the voice-over
would come in.

1314
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:11,165
Manuel took over the life
of his brother.

1315
01:29:13,458 --> 01:29:16,832
No one could've mistaken
Manuel for Pedro,

1316
01:29:17,708 --> 01:29:20,499
but Lucy and the whole town

1317
01:29:20,666 --> 01:29:23,624
chose to pretend
that Manuel was Pedro.

1318
01:29:25,333 --> 01:29:26,540
And full stop.

1319
01:29:28,916 --> 01:29:30,290
The end.

1320
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:35,957
Okay, cut.

1321
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:38,665
Very good.

1322
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:40,624
Very good, yes sir.

1323
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:43,624
Rest up, we'll be playing this
loads of times.

1324
01:29:43,791 --> 01:29:45,207
I didn't think it was that good.

1325
01:29:45,375 --> 01:29:47,874
You have to know it in your sleep.

1326
01:29:48,041 --> 01:29:49,457
But it was great.

1327
01:29:50,625 --> 01:29:51,665
Very good.

1328
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:54,082
All three looking at the camera, please.

1329
01:30:00,875 --> 01:30:02,540
Don't move.

1330
01:30:09,666 --> 01:30:11,415
Everyone look that way, please.

1331
01:30:11,583 --> 01:30:12,665
That's it.

1332
01:30:18,375 --> 01:30:20,707
Great. Smile, please.

1333
01:30:35,875 --> 01:30:38,040
One moment, please.

1334
01:30:40,583 --> 01:30:41,582
That's it.

1335
01:30:46,083 --> 01:30:48,915
Thank you, everyone,
for coming today.

1336
01:30:50,583 --> 01:30:53,332
It's a very important time
in my life.

1337
01:30:54,666 --> 01:30:59,415
We're celebrating the start
of this adventure I've put you on.

1338
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,665
Shooting begins in two days.

1339
01:31:05,541 --> 01:31:08,582
I want to thank these great artists,

1340
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:12,332
who at this stage of my life
I consider to be my friends,

1341
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:14,124
for joining the project.

1342
01:31:14,958 --> 01:31:18,915
Félix and Iván,
our two greatest actors,

1343
01:31:19,083 --> 01:31:21,124
together for the first time!

1344
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:24,582
Thank you very much.

1345
01:31:26,666 --> 01:31:27,999
Lola,

1346
01:31:28,625 --> 01:31:30,124
what can I tell you?

1347
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,457
-Sometimes you bewilder me.
-Oh, really?

1348
01:31:33,625 --> 01:31:37,790
But I see the genius of your ideas.

1349
01:31:38,041 --> 01:31:40,707
You know that
I consider you my friend.

1350
01:31:40,875 --> 01:31:43,915
Perhaps you want to say a few words.

1351
01:31:44,083 --> 01:31:44,749
No, no.

1352
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,707
-Yes, please, come, Lola.
-Thank you.

1353
01:31:46,875 --> 01:31:48,374
Yes, of course.

1354
01:31:50,208 --> 01:31:53,624
Thank you,
and make the best of films!

1355
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,082
The best of films....

1356
01:32:01,916 --> 01:32:04,165
What is that, Humberto?

1357
01:32:05,333 --> 01:32:07,082
I often wonder

1358
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:11,165
if there's a kind of canon
we should follow.

1359
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:13,540
Right? I wonder if...

1360
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:19,165
we can dislike a film,
but think it's good as well.

1361
01:32:19,791 --> 01:32:23,124
And when we think
a film is good, is it good?

1362
01:32:24,958 --> 01:32:27,165
I don't know,
maybe it only reaffirms

1363
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:31,582
our pigeonholed,
entrenched tastes.

1364
01:32:31,916 --> 01:32:35,249
We should be very careful
about what we like.

1365
01:32:36,875 --> 01:32:38,707
Because one sees
what one understands,

1366
01:32:38,875 --> 01:32:41,874
and what one doesn't understand,
one doesn't like.

1367
01:32:44,541 --> 01:32:49,040
Many important things
are those we don't understand.

1368
01:32:49,916 --> 01:32:51,832
Thank you, everyone.

1369
01:33:00,708 --> 01:33:02,582
I was thinking

1370
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:05,124
it'd be great if you asked Félix...

1371
01:33:05,291 --> 01:33:05,999
What?

1372
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:09,374
If you asked Félix to record
a message for Emilia,

1373
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:10,874
she's a huge fan of his.

1374
01:33:11,041 --> 01:33:14,332
Don't count on me for such drivel.

1375
01:33:16,291 --> 01:33:18,165
But she's your niece.

1376
01:33:18,541 --> 01:33:19,790
And she's turning 15.

1377
01:33:19,958 --> 01:33:22,999
Those things are cringeworthy.

1378
01:33:24,625 --> 01:33:26,290
She'd die to get...

1379
01:33:26,458 --> 01:33:27,499
Even worse.

1380
01:33:27,666 --> 01:33:29,249
I'm sorry.

1381
01:33:29,416 --> 01:33:34,415
I don't agree with the vile upbringing
the parents gave that poor creature.

1382
01:33:35,583 --> 01:33:39,082
He gave out such a whomping...

1383
01:33:40,250 --> 01:33:43,332
If we'd done it for real,
it wouldn't have been

1384
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:45,499
as dangerous as it was.

1385
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:47,915
-Félix, excuse me.
-Hi, Violeta. What's up?

1386
01:33:48,083 --> 01:33:48,957
-How are you?
-Good, great.

1387
01:33:49,125 --> 01:33:50,290
I wanted to ask you a favour.

1388
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:54,124
It's my niece's birthday
and I'd like you to record a video.

1389
01:33:54,291 --> 01:33:55,582
-Do you mind?
-No, no.

1390
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:56,943
Thanks a lot.

1391
01:33:57,125 --> 01:33:58,624
-What's her name?
-Emilia.

1392
01:33:58,791 --> 01:34:00,165
-Emilia.
-She's turning 15.

1393
01:34:01,833 --> 01:34:03,165
Hello, Emi.

1394
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:04,624
Happy birthday.

1395
01:34:24,375 --> 01:34:25,582
Indeed!

1396
01:34:25,916 --> 01:34:27,290
How rude.

1397
01:34:29,875 --> 01:34:33,082
You can't leave dishes from
the first round uncollected.

1398
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:34,582
It's unacceptable.

1399
01:34:34,833 --> 01:34:37,999
I don't know if you're blind
or just idiots.

1400
01:34:38,166 --> 01:34:41,665
So stop running around
like headless chickens and do it.

1401
01:34:41,833 --> 01:34:43,332
Sorry, right away, don't worry.

1402
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:46,707
No, I do worry.
Of course I worry!

1403
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:48,457
Don Iván!

1404
01:34:48,625 --> 01:34:50,874
What are you doing here?
Can I help you?

1405
01:34:51,041 --> 01:34:53,165
I need a cigarette,
have you got one?

1406
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:56,999
I'll smoke with you.

1407
01:35:01,041 --> 01:35:03,915
Now I'm the face
for a charity campaign

1408
01:35:04,083 --> 01:35:08,207
that makes houses for African refugees
from discarded containers.

1409
01:35:08,375 --> 01:35:10,957
You've seen those ship containers.

1410
01:35:11,208 --> 01:35:13,707
They make beautiful houses
out of them.

1411
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:15,249
They're small,

1412
01:35:15,583 --> 01:35:18,582
-but very beautiful.
-Great.

1413
01:35:19,625 --> 01:35:22,457
Sorry, I have to take
an important call.

1414
01:35:22,708 --> 01:35:23,915
Just a second.

1415
01:35:25,208 --> 01:35:29,707
And in the name of "charisma"
we have to endure horrible actors

1416
01:35:29,958 --> 01:35:32,707
with a lobotomized audience
that adores them.

1417
01:35:32,875 --> 01:35:34,707
It's a vicious circle,
where the audience...

1418
01:35:34,875 --> 01:35:37,457
I'm dying to be with you too,

1419
01:35:37,625 --> 01:35:39,707
but not today, it's impossible.

1420
01:35:39,875 --> 01:35:41,665
Keep that urge for tomorrow.

1421
01:35:41,833 --> 01:35:44,624
And that energy,
you're going to need it.

1422
01:35:44,791 --> 01:35:47,290
Félix is without a doubt
the worst actor

1423
01:35:47,458 --> 01:35:49,249
I've worked with in my life.

1424
01:35:49,416 --> 01:35:53,332
It's incredible that a guy
so lacking in resources

1425
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:55,290
has had the career he's had.

1426
01:35:55,458 --> 01:35:57,832
Clearly, the film industry

1427
01:35:58,083 --> 01:36:00,707
is too generous, too generous.

1428
01:36:00,875 --> 01:36:05,124
Lola told me
what they're paying him.

1429
01:36:05,333 --> 01:36:06,957
-It's grotesque.
-Right.

1430
01:36:07,416 --> 01:36:08,540
Grotesque.

1431
01:36:08,708 --> 01:36:11,999
And the brute thinks that because
he's paid this obscene amount,

1432
01:36:12,166 --> 01:36:13,707
because it is obscene,

1433
01:36:13,916 --> 01:36:17,749
he's better than those of us who
get paid a reasonable amount.

1434
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,582
I'd never let them pay me
what they pay him.

1435
01:36:20,833 --> 01:36:23,290
It'd be dishonest...

1436
01:36:23,458 --> 01:36:25,582
pornographic, even.

1437
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:29,332
I totally agree, I totally agree.

1438
01:36:29,541 --> 01:36:32,749
One is certainly not
the money one makes.

1439
01:36:32,916 --> 01:36:33,999
I, for example...

1440
01:36:34,166 --> 01:36:37,665
And it's not the first time
I've worked with an idiot.

1441
01:36:37,833 --> 01:36:39,790
I'm used to it.

1442
01:36:40,041 --> 01:36:41,207
But...

1443
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,790
this individual, so to speak,

1444
01:36:46,041 --> 01:36:49,457
has the worst problem
anyone can have:

1445
01:36:49,625 --> 01:36:52,040
He doesn't know
that he doesn't know it.

1446
01:36:53,125 --> 01:36:55,165
He doesn't know
that he doesn't know it.

1447
01:36:55,375 --> 01:36:56,457
Sure.

1448
01:36:56,625 --> 01:36:59,499
Ignorance plus arrogance.
The worst thing.

1449
01:37:00,125 --> 01:37:01,332
The worst thing.

1450
01:37:03,458 --> 01:37:05,040
Anyway...

1451
01:37:05,208 --> 01:37:08,540
I think the main thing now is...

1452
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:13,165
to focus on the film, isn't it?

1453
01:37:17,625 --> 01:37:19,415
Well, I'm heading down

1454
01:37:19,583 --> 01:37:22,749
because if I'm not there,
it all falls apart.

1455
01:37:22,916 --> 01:37:23,790
Are you coming?

1456
01:37:23,958 --> 01:37:24,999
No, you go.

1457
01:37:25,166 --> 01:37:28,999
I'm fucking sick
of this decadent circus

1458
01:37:29,166 --> 01:37:32,082
of airheads, whores and the corrupt.

1459
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:33,374
You go.

1460
01:37:35,166 --> 01:37:36,374
It's finished.

1461
01:37:40,416 --> 01:37:43,165
Well, I'll get going.

1462
01:37:51,458 --> 01:37:52,749
Anyway...

1463
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:06,457
Félix, buddy...

1464
01:38:06,625 --> 01:38:07,582
Right then...

1465
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:10,749
Say that again,
you old piece of shit.

1466
01:38:10,916 --> 01:38:12,415
You whinger.

1467
01:38:12,583 --> 01:38:14,999
Let's see if your face
really is untouchable.

1468
01:38:15,166 --> 01:38:16,374
Right then...

1469
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:28,332
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1470
01:38:48,458 --> 01:38:50,082
Fuck.

1471
01:39:01,583 --> 01:39:03,999
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1472
01:39:22,375 --> 01:39:23,707
Everyth ing's-fi ne.

1473
01:39:27,291 --> 01:39:28,665
Everything's fine.

1474
01:39:33,333 --> 01:39:35,040
Everything's fine.

1475
01:39:47,666 --> 01:39:49,582
Yes, the Humberto Suárez Foundation.

1476
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:52,040
It's the third time I've called.

1477
01:39:52,791 --> 01:39:54,207
Yeah, it was me.

1478
01:39:59,250 --> 01:40:01,415
There's a man...!

1479
01:40:04,416 --> 01:40:08,165
Yes, but this is
the third time I've called.

1480
01:40:22,875 --> 01:40:24,249
-What happened?
-He jumped.

1481
01:40:24,416 --> 01:40:27,082
-What?
-Or fell, I don't know.

1482
01:40:28,791 --> 01:40:32,582
How many times do I have to call
for a goddamn ambulance?

1483
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,999
Again, Félix!

1484
01:42:22,708 --> 01:42:23,915
Here, here!

1485
01:42:24,083 --> 01:42:26,749
Félix! Félix!

1486
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:43,457
<i>RIVALRY</i>
A FILM BY LOLA CUEVAS

1487
01:42:57,708 --> 01:42:59,207
Next question.

1488
01:42:59,708 --> 01:43:00,790
You.

1489
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:05,707
First of all,
congratulations on the film.

1490
01:43:05,875 --> 01:43:09,832
I saw it at the morning screening
and I was astounded.

1491
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,540
-The question, please.
-Yes, sorry.

1492
01:43:12,708 --> 01:43:14,207
For Lola.

1493
01:43:14,375 --> 01:43:18,207
In your film there is a clear
ideological position,

1494
01:43:18,375 --> 01:43:24,582
a critique of the role of women
within the patriarchal society.

1495
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:28,082
The position doesn't matter,
if there was one.

1496
01:43:28,791 --> 01:43:29,457
It doesn't matter.

1497
01:43:29,625 --> 01:43:34,332
One has to stop doing
an ideological frisk of everything,

1498
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:38,915
to stop pigeonholing works
by their presumed ideology.

1499
01:43:39,625 --> 01:43:43,415
The fact that you see
a manifesto in my film

1500
01:43:43,916 --> 01:43:45,874
is rather reductionist,

1501
01:43:47,291 --> 01:43:50,082
to my taste, intellectually lazy.

1502
01:43:50,458 --> 01:43:55,374
A film isn't an affirmation,
an answer to a question,

1503
01:43:55,541 --> 01:43:59,290
just as art does not
refer to something,

1504
01:43:59,458 --> 01:44:02,457
but is a thing in itself.

1505
01:44:06,708 --> 01:44:07,707
Next question.

1506
01:44:10,041 --> 01:44:11,415
You, please.

1507
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:15,832
Thank you.

1508
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,374
For Félix Rivero.

1509
01:44:19,708 --> 01:44:22,832
Iván Torres was meant to
be your co-star in this film.

1510
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,707
Then tragedy struck.

1511
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:31,082
How was the experience
of playing both characters?

1512
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:36,124
Do you have any news
of Iván's state of health?

1513
01:44:36,333 --> 01:44:39,832
They haven't issued
a medical report for some time.

1514
01:44:40,083 --> 01:44:42,540
Beginning with the main thing,

1515
01:44:42,708 --> 01:44:45,499
there is no news on Iván's state.

1516
01:44:46,291 --> 01:44:49,124
He's the same,
in a vegetative state.

1517
01:44:49,708 --> 01:44:53,207
The diagnosis is diff...

1518
01:44:54,375 --> 01:44:57,290
Diffuse axonal injury.

1519
01:44:57,458 --> 01:44:58,415
Exactly.

1520
01:44:58,666 --> 01:45:00,165
Diffuse axonal injury.

1521
01:45:00,333 --> 01:45:02,957
He's in a deep coma,

1522
01:45:03,125 --> 01:45:05,457
no reaction at all, poor man.

1523
01:45:05,625 --> 01:45:09,374
From what the doctors say,
it's irreversible.

1524
01:45:09,875 --> 01:45:12,290
It was a very tough situation,

1525
01:45:12,458 --> 01:45:16,207
I never quite understood
what really happened.

1526
01:45:16,833 --> 01:45:20,707
Iván was a very complex,
tortured person.

1527
01:45:20,875 --> 01:45:23,207
Anyway... Terrible.

1528
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:26,290
We'll never know
what was going through his head.

1529
01:45:26,458 --> 01:45:28,749
Personally, I'm still,

1530
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,915
as you can imagine, devastated.

1531
01:45:32,458 --> 01:45:35,290
That's why,
when Lola told me her idea,

1532
01:45:35,458 --> 01:45:37,374
brilliant, by the way,

1533
01:45:37,583 --> 01:45:40,165
of playing Iván's character as well,

1534
01:45:40,375 --> 01:45:43,124
I saw it as a tribute.

1535
01:45:44,115 --> 01:45:45,163
And I know,

1536
01:45:45,649 --> 01:45:47,166
I'm certain,

1537
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:51,207
that he would've done
the same for this film.

1538
01:45:52,083 --> 01:45:54,790
Iván, my dear...

1539
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:01,832
Thank you so much,

1540
01:46:03,970 --> 01:46:05,506
<i>maestro.</i>

1541
01:46:06,237 --> 01:46:07,472
Friend.

1542
01:46:08,643 --> 01:46:09,958
Brother.

1543
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:22,457
You.

1544
01:46:25,041 --> 01:46:26,249
For Lola, please.

1545
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:29,540
Have you imagined what the film
would be with Iván Torres,

1546
01:46:29,708 --> 01:46:33,540
if what unfortunately happened
hadn't happened?

1547
01:46:37,359 --> 01:46:38,488
No.

1548
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,124
Thank you.

1549
01:46:44,666 --> 01:46:46,499
Next question.

1550
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:56,957
<i>When does a film end?</i>

1551
01:48:00,666 --> 01:48:01,915
<i>Now?</i>

1552
01:48:03,208 --> 01:48:05,790
<i>When the end credits come on?</i>

1553
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:11,499
<i>At the cinema exit,
when we argue about it?</i>

1554
01:48:13,041 --> 01:48:16,332
<i>The next day,
a month later, a year later?</i>

1555
01:48:20,583 --> 01:48:22,999
<i>Or every time we think about it?</i>

1556
01:48:25,416 --> 01:48:29,332
<i>Some films end
with the closing credits.</i>

1557
01:48:32,291 --> 01:48:33,915
Félix...

1558
01:48:35,166 --> 01:48:36,790
Rivero.

1559
01:48:40,583 --> 01:48:44,582
Fucking son of a bitch.

1560
01:48:45,875 --> 01:48:47,457
<i>But others,</i>

1561
01:48:48,208 --> 01:48:49,374
believe me,

1562
01:48:51,125 --> 01:48:54,249
may never end.
