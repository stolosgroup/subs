Regina, I am prepared to depart.
Have my project brought up.

[Regina] <i>Yes, Mr. Wenan.</i>

Billy, I just got word

00:01:57,862 --> 00:02:01,126
that your father will not be
joining us for Christmas.

Oh, I know, sweetie.

It's... his work.

9
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:07,686
It's unfortunate.

10
00:02:07,814 --> 00:02:10,534
I was really looking
forward to seeing John.

11
00:02:10,662 --> 00:02:15,270
I'm sorry that I won't be able
to be there for you today.

on the day's orders,

I'd get in some practice.

91
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:14,150
- [woman] How long did this take you?
- Two weeks of conceptualizing

and ten days
of actual building.

93

with this?

power within a flowing water source,

sell their toys and sodas and cars.

You might be right.

to be well below
our current budget.

Now, to make up
for that shortfall...

00:43:24,485 --> 00:43:26,662
and throughout the duration
of this engagement.

634
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:31,174
These rules are for your safety,
and your safety alone.

635
00:43:31,301 --> 00:43:34,246
Number one,
you will be fingerprinted,

636
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:38,054
- assigned a security badge to be worn at all times.
- Next.

637
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:41,669
Number two, you must enter
and exit the factory floor

638
00:43:41,798 --> 00:43:43,718
through the
southern bay doors only.

639
00:43:43,846 --> 00:43:48,006
Number three, you must remove
the bells from your uniforms

640
00:43:48,133 --> 00:43:50,695
as they will set off
our metal detectors.

641
00:43:50,822 --> 00:43:55,109
In addition to these rules,
we will be upgrading the site's security.

642
00:43:55,782 --> 00:43:57,573
Do you have any questions?

643
00:43:58,918 --> 00:43:59,974
Yes.

644
00:44:00,101 --> 00:44:02,311
What kind of toys
are we making, sir?

645
00:44:02,437 --> 00:44:03,782
Not toys, miss.

646
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,982
Control panels for
America's eagle in the sky,

647
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,734
our FJ-63 fighter jets.

649
00:44:17,926 --> 00:44:19,813
What's the purpose
of your visit?

650
00:44:20,455 --> 00:44:23,206
Recreation. Hunting.

651
00:44:23,335 --> 00:44:25,382
I'm gonna kill some things.

652
00:44:27,622 --> 00:44:29,509
You fill out the 5589?

653
00:44:29,638 --> 00:44:33,413
Yes, ma'am,
I have my 5589...

654
00:44:33,862 --> 00:44:36,902
my 4457,

655
00:44:37,029 --> 00:44:39,782
and my 3177 right here.

[stamper clicks]

658
00:44:58,213 --> 00:44:59,462
All right.

659
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:00,966
Welcome to Canada.

660
00:45:01,414 --> 00:45:02,853
Good to be here.

661
00:45:44,935 --> 00:45:47,815
Holy Christ, Corporal,
you call that hammering?

662
00:45:48,485 --> 00:45:50,727
Show a little pride
in your work.

663
00:45:50,853 --> 00:45:52,102
Here. You're up.

664
00:45:52,229 --> 00:45:54,118
[loud crash]

00:45:54,245 --> 00:45:55,909
Holy hell.

666
00:45:56,038 --> 00:45:58,406
Soldier, get your sorry ass
out of that lift.

667
00:45:58,533 --> 00:46:00,135
Clean that shit up.

00:46:13,798 --> 00:46:15,269
Hey, partner. Here.

670
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:16,837
Hang on to this.

I come in peace.

676
00:46:43,174 --> 00:46:44,806
Thank you.

677
00:46:59,655 --> 00:47:01,575
Morning, 7.
How's everybody holding up?

678
00:47:01,702 --> 00:47:04,966
Very well, sir. We got the
line up and running last night.

679
00:47:05,093 --> 00:47:07,621
- Right now we're optimizing.
- Oh, yeah.

680
00:47:07,749 --> 00:47:09,925
Okay, optimizing.
I see.

681
00:47:10,053 --> 00:47:11,845
19, 23,
how are you doing?

682
00:47:11,973 --> 00:47:14,151
- Wonderfully perfect, sir.
- Uh, super-duper good.

683
00:47:14,278 --> 00:47:16,870
Ah, I appreciate
the positivity.

684
00:47:16,998 --> 00:47:17,926
Are you buying that?

685
00:47:18,055 --> 00:47:19,815
Absolutely, boss.

686
00:47:19,942 --> 00:47:23,013
I really backed you into a corner on this
one, 7. Don't think I don't know that.

687
00:47:23,142 --> 00:47:25,861
The order calls for a lot of
product in a short amount of time.

688
00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:29,701
Yeah, it's gonna be a squeaker even if
everything goes perfect. Refill, thanks.

689
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:31,013
Which it never does.

690
00:47:31,142 --> 00:47:32,837
When have you seen it
go perfect?

691
00:47:32,965 --> 00:47:35,398
- 1910 was close.
- There was a bad war that year.

692
00:47:35,526 --> 00:47:36,549
You can't blame
yourself.

693
00:47:36,677 --> 00:47:39,175
- I'll go check the crew.
- The office.

694
00:47:39,301 --> 00:47:40,678
Oh, one more thing.

695
00:47:40,806 --> 00:47:42,373
7...

696
00:47:42,502 --> 00:47:45,189
this is make or break
for us.

697
00:47:45,317 --> 00:47:48,646
I don't need to tell you that
absolutely everything is on the line.

698
00:47:49,638 --> 00:47:52,294
Christmas is at stake, sir.
We won't let you down.

699
00:47:52,422 --> 00:47:55,558
- We'll have the order finished on time.
- Good man.

700
00:47:55,686 --> 00:47:58,119
Chris, I just
talked to my superiors.

701
00:47:58,246 --> 00:48:00,326
They're very impressed with
the numbers that I gave them.

702
00:48:00,453 --> 00:48:03,685
They're sending in a couple of suits
to have a look at the operation.

703
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:05,862
It's a very impressive
group of...

704
00:48:06,726 --> 00:48:08,646
little workers
you've got here.

705
00:48:08,775 --> 00:48:09,735
Real hard workers.

706
00:48:10,951 --> 00:48:13,126
I'd like to use the break
room, if that's possible.

707
00:48:13,253 --> 00:48:15,686
I'm running an eight-man
rotation, four on at all times.

708
00:48:15,813 --> 00:48:18,821
Me or one of my men are gonna be
inside the factory 24 hours a day.

709
00:48:18,949 --> 00:48:20,837
How does that
sit with you, 7?

710
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:23,686
We can take our breaks
in the cafeteria.

711
00:48:23,813 --> 00:48:25,990
Many thanks to you.
Captain Jacobs.

712
00:48:26,118 --> 00:48:27,589
- 7.
- 7?

713
00:48:27,718 --> 00:48:29,638
We're all ranked and
accounted for by number.

714
00:48:29,766 --> 00:48:31,015
It's more efficient
that way.

715
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,966
7's our factory foreman.

716
00:48:33,093 --> 00:48:34,213
What happened to
1 through 6?

717
00:48:34,342 --> 00:48:36,229
Well, we've been at this
a long time.

718
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:38,278
We don't reissue numbers.

719
00:48:38,406 --> 00:48:41,223
That would be unethical
and dishonorable.

720
00:48:42,214 --> 00:48:43,110
I like it.

721
00:48:43,239 --> 00:48:44,997
That's a hell of
a way to run a crew.

722
00:48:45,126 --> 00:48:48,613
Would you like a cookie,
Captain Jacobs?

723
00:48:49,222 --> 00:48:50,501
Indeed.

724
00:48:51,717 --> 00:48:53,253
A hell of a way
to run a crew.

725
00:48:53,381 --> 00:48:54,663
Excuse me.

726
00:48:59,622 --> 00:49:00,678
Mmm.

727
00:49:01,861 --> 00:49:03,109
Wow.

[squeaking continues]

730
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:16,902
You all right, buddy?

731
00:49:30,693 --> 00:49:33,797
The hamster hammock is a top
seller and this, the roller.

732
00:49:33,926 --> 00:49:36,453
Then we have
the seesaw.

733
00:49:36,581 --> 00:49:39,271
Nibblers and
the pet playhouse.

734
00:49:39,397 --> 00:49:41,542
There's no room
for the pet playhouse.

735
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:44,422
You know, it's funny.
You don't strike me as a hamster person.

736
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:47,686
- Well, I am.
- You seem more like a... a reptile person.

737
00:49:47,815 --> 00:49:49,861
Do you like lizards?

738
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,711
I have a great selection
of chameleons.

739
00:49:52,837 --> 00:49:54,821
I don't want a chameleon.

740
00:49:56,358 --> 00:49:57,541
Snakes.

741
00:49:57,669 --> 00:50:00,453
That's it.
You're a snake person.

742
00:50:01,413 --> 00:50:03,110
Snakes eat hamsters.

743
00:50:03,238 --> 00:50:05,477
You know, lots of people don't know
what kind of pet person they are,

744
00:50:05,606 --> 00:50:07,526
but I'm really good
at this.

745
00:50:08,326 --> 00:50:10,630
You know, you remind me
a lot of my mother.

746
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,101
- Really?
- Yeah.

747
00:50:12,229 --> 00:50:13,830
She wasn't
a good listener,

748
00:50:13,957 --> 00:50:16,997
and she never knew
when to shut the fuck up.

749
00:50:19,749 --> 00:50:21,094
Thank you.

750
00:50:38,598 --> 00:50:40,166
Here you go, fellas.

751
00:50:46,726 --> 00:50:47,749
- Hi.
- Hey.

752
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,094
Mr. Cringle.
[chuckles]

753
00:50:49,222 --> 00:50:51,397
We had a hell of a time
finding this place.

754
00:50:51,526 --> 00:50:53,477
Asked around town,
but no one had a clue.

755
00:50:53,606 --> 00:50:55,975
Yeah, as you can imagine,
it has to be that way.

756
00:50:56,101 --> 00:50:57,286
And we think
it's a good thing.

757
00:50:57,414 --> 00:50:59,173
Great thing.
Yeah, I'm Lex Taylor.

758
00:50:59,302 --> 00:51:02,086
- This is, uh, Carter Mapplethorpe.
- I know who you are.

759
00:51:02,214 --> 00:51:04,263
Right. They warned us
about that.

760
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:06,693
Things were a little touch-and-go
for a couple of years.

761
00:51:06,821 --> 00:51:08,326
Weren't they, Carter?

Oh, that's Donner.
He gets a mite nippy.

764
00:51:14,982 --> 00:51:17,446
You're lucky it wasn't Blitzer.
She'd tear your package right off.

765
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:20,101
- [reindeer bellows]
- Well, have a look around, fellas.

766
00:51:20,229 --> 00:51:21,958
7, my shop foreman,

767
00:51:22,085 --> 00:51:23,686
will show you anything
you might need to see.

768
00:51:23,815 --> 00:51:25,925
We, uh, don't need to have
a look around, Chris.

769
00:51:26,053 --> 00:51:28,550
No, we've seen the numbers,
we've seen the samples,

770
00:51:28,678 --> 00:51:30,438
and the work you do
is exceptional.

771
00:51:30,566 --> 00:51:33,733
The military would like to procure
your services on an annual basis.

772
00:51:33,862 --> 00:51:35,878
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves here.

773
00:51:36,006 --> 00:51:40,934
We are prepared to guarantee
your subsidization for 15 years.

774
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:43,718
I hear
what you're saying,

775
00:51:43,846 --> 00:51:45,670
but this is a one-time deal,
gentlemen.

776
00:51:45,798 --> 00:51:49,190
How about you wait until you get that
check on the first of next month,

777
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:52,454
and then we'll see if you
don't have a change of heart.

778
00:51:52,582 --> 00:51:53,990
That's not gonna happen.

779
00:51:54,118 --> 00:51:57,030
I appreciate your optimism,
sir, I-I really do,

780
00:51:57,158 --> 00:52:00,038
but with all due respect,
I think both of us know

781
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:03,558
that there's a very good chance you're
gonna end up right back here next year.

782
00:52:04,261 --> 00:52:05,670
And then maybe,
Mr. Cringle,

783
00:52:05,798 --> 00:52:09,061
- the deal we offer won't be so sweet.
- Mm-hmm.

784
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:11,302
I'll keep
some axle grease handy

785
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:13,638
just in case
I change my mind.

786
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:18,246
Okay.

Jonathan Miller.

1118
01:18:56,422 --> 01:18:58,373
You twisted child.

1119
01:19:01,446 --> 01:19:04,359
And I always thought
you forgot about me.

1120
01:19:12,549 --> 01:19:14,086
You remember this?

1121
01:19:15,622 --> 01:19:18,918
This was the only goddamn
thing you ever got me.

1122

[grunts]

1123
01:19:29,382 --> 01:19:34,054
After all the times
that I wrote you.

1124
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:39,653
I'm sorry, son.

1125
01:19:42,151 --> 01:19:44,453
There are limits
to what I can do.

1126
01:19:46,213 --> 01:19:48,646
I couldn't replace
your parents.

1127
01:19:51,205 --> 01:19:52,455
Yeah.

1128
01:19:53,478 --> 01:19:54,789
You couldn't.

1129
01:19:58,215 --> 01:20:00,006
Well, here we are.

1130
01:20:02,533 --> 01:20:06,469
I've come for your head,
fat man!

1131
01:20:09,382 --> 01:20:11,141
You think
you're the first?

1132
01:20:14,021 --> 01:20:17,829
You think I got this job
because I'm fat and jolly?

Chris?

Chris, love?

[gasps]

1159
01:25:59,302 --> 01:26:02,405
It's okay.
Just try and relax.

Helga!

1162
01:26:58,310 --> 01:27:01,029
I'll be working in my room
for the rest of the evening,

1163
01:27:01,158 --> 01:27:03,142
so no interruptions.

1164
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:04,326
[Helga]
Yes, Mr. Wenan.

1165
01:27:04,454 --> 01:27:06,918
Why are you calling me
about this now?

1166
01:27:07,045 --> 01:27:09,478
How can there be
that much missing?

1167
01:27:09,606 --> 01:27:12,134
Oh, I want this tracked.

1168
01:27:12,262 --> 01:27:15,014
Find out where
it was cashed.

1169
01:27:15,142 --> 01:27:17,094
Then check my signatures.

1170
01:27:17,221 --> 01:27:21,093
Call the bank. Tell them to
keep an eye on all my accounts.

1171
01:27:21,222 --> 01:27:24,742
If there's a rat,
I want to snap its little neck.

[knocking]

1177
01:28:02,502 --> 01:28:06,342
Damn it, Helga.
I said no interruptions.

1178
01:28:08,102 --> 01:28:12,038
Don't you speak English?
I said stay out.

1179
01:28:13,989 --> 01:28:15,526
Who the hell are you?

1180
01:28:16,486 --> 01:28:17,926
I'm Ruth.

1181
01:28:18,949 --> 01:28:21,542
And this is Chris.

1182
01:28:32,582 --> 01:28:34,534
- [door closes]
- [Chris] Billy.

1183
01:28:35,558 --> 01:28:36,933
Well...

1184
01:28:38,118 --> 01:28:40,262
I can't say
I'm surprised.

1185
01:28:41,446 --> 01:28:43,045
Mmm.

1186
01:28:52,134 --> 01:28:54,726
Yeah. Fentanyl.

1187
01:28:55,558 --> 01:28:57,414
That'll get the job done.

1188
01:29:03,686 --> 01:29:05,702
This is partly my fault.

1189
01:29:06,854 --> 01:29:10,310
You know, I just haven't quite
been myself lately, have I, dear?

1190
01:29:10,438 --> 01:29:11,845
[Ruth] Mm-mmm.

1191
01:29:12,646 --> 01:29:15,974
But the time has come
to turn things around.

1192
01:29:16,645 --> 01:29:19,781
I've decided to be proactive.

1193
01:29:21,286 --> 01:29:23,206
And it starts with you.

1194
01:29:26,982 --> 01:29:29,477
Ow. Ow. Ow.

1195
01:29:31,397 --> 01:29:32,709
Ow.

1196
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:58,150
[Chris]
Now look at me, child.

1197
01:30:01,190 --> 01:30:03,558
I said look at me.

1198
01:30:04,838 --> 01:30:08,007
A wicked soul
bent on bloodshed

1199
01:30:08,133 --> 01:30:09,862
was sent
to collect my head.

1200
01:30:09,991 --> 01:30:15,846
Like you, he thought he lived
outside of morals and consequence.

1201
01:30:17,477 --> 01:30:20,646
He is now buried
with his lack of reverence.

1202
01:30:21,766 --> 01:30:24,005
One more time,
Billy Wenan,

1203
01:30:24,134 --> 01:30:26,086
once more,

1204
01:30:26,215 --> 01:30:29,605
and you'll be getting more
than coal in your stocking.

1205
01:30:30,725 --> 01:30:33,542
If your grandmother
meets an early grave,

1206
01:30:34,405 --> 01:30:38,022
if Christine Crawford
suffers so much as a cold,

1207
01:30:38,149 --> 01:30:43,397
if anybody that crosses your path is made
to feel less or lower because of you...

1208
01:30:44,742 --> 01:30:46,533
I'm coming back.

1209
01:30:48,166 --> 01:30:52,709
I'll come while you sleep
and rip you from your covers.

1210
01:30:52,838 --> 01:30:57,766
By my hand, you will know the
consequence of your actions.

1211
01:31:00,133 --> 01:31:02,214
So don't screw it up.

1212
01:31:06,054 --> 01:31:09,286
The fat man's
got his eye on you, kid.

1213
01:31:24,133 --> 01:31:25,478
[squeaking]

1214
01:31:41,031 --> 01:31:42,373
Mmm.

1215
01:32:04,678 --> 01:32:06,790
Why don't you all take 15?

1216
01:32:06,918 --> 01:32:08,805
Uh, I'd really
rather not.

1217
01:32:08,935 --> 01:32:10,982
I wasn't asking.

1218
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:12,646
[Chris] If there's one thing
I've learned, 7,

1219
01:32:12,775 --> 01:32:14,822
it's never argue with
a woman gifting cookies.

1220
01:32:14,949 --> 01:32:17,766
Oh, I'll tell the crew
we're on a break.

1221
01:32:17,893 --> 01:32:20,487
Yeah. I'll take one of
those, if you don't mind.

1222
01:32:20,613 --> 01:32:22,789
Aren't you supposed
to be taking it easy?

1223
01:32:22,918 --> 01:32:24,038
I am.

1224
01:32:29,478 --> 01:32:32,871
We'll have this place up in no
time, bigger and better than before.

1225
01:32:32,998 --> 01:32:34,630
And we're gonna
keep it that way.

1226
01:32:34,758 --> 01:32:36,325
We are.

1227
01:32:37,062 --> 01:32:38,917
- [chuckles]
- Lovely.
