00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,800
Alice...

4
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:08,301
Have you seen my gun?

5
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:16,702
Somewhere.

6
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,503
Thought I had packed it with the photos.

7
00:02:25,404 --> 00:02:27,704
Alice?

8
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:37,705
Honey?

9
00:02:39,806 --> 00:02:42,706
Is everything okay?

10
00:02:47,557 --> 00:02:49,307
I'm okay.

11
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,608
Come on Sweetie, come here.

12
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:09,009
What happened?

13
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,010
Was it cramps?

14
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:18,511
I'm just scared.

15
00:03:19,812 --> 00:03:21,912
Yeah, I know.

16
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:27,413
Everything's okay though, right?

17
00:03:28,314 --> 00:03:30,014
Right.

18
00:03:37,115 --> 00:03:39,315
You couldn't find it?

19
00:03:40,216 --> 00:03:42,316
No, I don't have
time to look.

20
00:03:42,317 --> 00:03:44,717
I'm sure the Inspector
will understand.

21
00:03:45,418 --> 00:03:47,618
I hope so.

22
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,319
Are you nervous?

23
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,920
No.

24
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:57,421
Kinda feels like my first day.

25
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:01,122
I'm sure you will
a very good impression.

26
00:04:05,823 --> 00:04:08,423
I should go.

27
00:04:12,624 --> 00:04:14,324
I love you.

28
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:16,725
Me too.

29
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:33,025
You are not taking the car?

30
00:04:33,326 --> 00:04:34,926
Well, you might want to go into town.

31
00:04:35,627 --> 00:04:37,027
I can walk.

32
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:38,928
You can waddle.

33
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:41,429
Do you even know where you're going?

34
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,030
No idea.

35
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:18,233
<i>Good morning. I'm Richard Morecroft
with national and regional news.</i>

36
00:06:18,234 --> 00:06:22,034
<i>We've just received news that there's
been a large explosion...</i>

37
00:06:22,135 --> 00:06:24,935
<i>at Western Bay Maximum Security Prison.</i>

38
00:06:24,936 --> 00:06:28,236
<i>The residents of the area were awoken
around 8 AM...</i>

39
00:06:28,237 --> 00:06:31,837
<i>for what's being described as
a large booming sound.</i>

40
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:33,738
Hey..

41
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:36,639
I was just...
That's okay.

42
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,440
Constable Shane Cooper
reporting for duty.

43
00:06:40,141 --> 00:06:42,241
Sergeant Jim Barlow.

44
00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:44,442
Old Bill said you would be coming by.

45
00:06:44,643 --> 00:06:45,843
So did you just get into town?

46
00:06:46,244 --> 00:06:47,444
Uh yeah, late last night.

47
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:49,445
How was your drive?

48
00:06:49,546 --> 00:06:52,846
Well, it would have been quicker if my wife
didn't have to pee every two minutes.

49
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:56,847
What? She's got some sort of bladder problem?
No, no, she's pregnant.

50
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:59,548
Oh, that's great.

51
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:02,449
It's horseshit and you know it.

52
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,650
Bullshit!

53
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:06,451
Don't say that.

54
00:07:10,052 --> 00:07:12,052
Hey, Manning...

55
00:07:12,653 --> 00:07:15,453
<i>Don't bother me, Barlow.
I'm late.</i>

56
00:07:15,954 --> 00:07:18,854
Manning, come here,
there's someone I want you to meet.

57
00:07:21,355 --> 00:07:23,855
This is Shane Cooper. The new guy.

58
00:07:30,856 --> 00:07:33,256
He's having marriage difficulties.

59
00:07:34,257 --> 00:07:37,857
So is the Inspector in here or...

60
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,858
No, Old Bill's at Town Hall this morning.

61
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,859
He wanted me to send you there.

62
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,660
Well, you gonna tell me where it is? Or...

63
00:07:46,661 --> 00:07:48,561
Oh jeez, I'm sorry...

64
00:07:48,762 --> 00:07:51,062
Gonna have to get used
to having a city boy around.

65
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,863
You go back to the main road
and turn right.

66
00:07:54,864 --> 00:07:56,864
You go up the hill,
pass the information center...

67
00:07:56,965 --> 00:07:58,965
Information Center?
Oh yeah, you can't miss it,

68
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:01,166
There's a historical exhibit
on the front window.

69
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:03,367
Alright.

70
00:08:04,868 --> 00:08:06,568
Oh, Shane?

71
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,269
You won't tell Old Bill
I was sleeping, will you?

72
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,270
Not unless you tell him
I was late.

73
00:08:15,671 --> 00:08:18,771
Oh, you guys know there's a horse
loose in the parking lot?

74
00:08:18,772 --> 00:08:21,172
Yeah, that's our Betsy. She lives here.

75
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:24,073
Of course she does.

76
00:08:50,274 --> 00:08:53,574
I often wonder what
this town would of been like...

77
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,975
back when it was thriving.

78
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:59,776
When it had a sense
of purpose and pride.

79
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:04,377
And since that time
we've had the logger shut down,

80
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:06,578
the sewing mill abandoned,

81
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,179
and crops reduced to dust,

82
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,080
and the high country...

83
00:09:11,181 --> 00:09:14,081
riped off for a national reserve.

84
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:17,982
Well, it turns out fitly...

85
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:21,183
the Martha here suggests that
we rub the last scrap of business...

86
00:09:21,184 --> 00:09:23,184
out of this godforsaken town.

87
00:09:27,085 --> 00:09:29,985
That is not the point, Bill,
and you know it!

88
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:32,386
Instead of living in the past...

89
00:09:32,587 --> 00:09:36,287
this city ought to be looking
towards new revenue streams.

90
00:09:37,188 --> 00:09:41,688
You're not suggesting we host
a food and wine festival, are you?

91
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:45,689
Our forefathers didn't sacrifice

92
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,590
their blood, sweat, and tears...

93
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,690
so that a bunch of wankers
could come here and sip fucking Pinot!

94
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:02,791
For those who want to destroy this town,

95
00:10:04,592 --> 00:10:07,092
they better deal with me first...

96
00:10:08,793 --> 00:10:11,593
cause I'm not going down without a fight!

97
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:26,894
Where's your gun, Constable?

98
00:10:34,695 --> 00:10:35,695
Sir?

99
00:10:39,696 --> 00:10:40,696
Inspector?

100
00:10:43,597 --> 00:10:46,597
Look, I arrived late last night...

101
00:10:47,098 --> 00:10:48,598
I had a house full of boxes...

102
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:50,699
Why didn't you unpack it?

103
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,900
Sir, I didn't know where it was.

104
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:55,501
So you lost it?

105
00:10:55,602 --> 00:10:57,402
No sir, I just didn't have time to find it.

106
00:10:57,403 --> 00:10:59,903
If you knew where it was,
you would have unpacked it.

107
00:11:00,204 --> 00:11:01,904
Sir...

108
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:05,705
You know that losing a police issued
firearm is a serious offense?

109
00:11:06,806 --> 00:11:09,606
I'd be happy to report
the firearm is formally missing,

110
00:11:09,607 --> 00:11:11,607
if you fell that it's required, sir.

111
00:11:13,108 --> 00:11:16,408
Don't go crawling up my ass just yet Constable.

112
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,009
I haven't had breakfast yet.

113
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,510
Yes, sir.

114
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:35,511
You are the transfer assigned?

115
00:11:37,612 --> 00:11:39,812
Personal reasons, I guess.

116
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:43,213
What sort of personal reasons?

117
00:11:48,514 --> 00:11:51,514
Just give us a minute, Slim.

118
00:12:07,515 --> 00:12:11,215
If I'm gonna be your superior,
there's nothing that you can't share with me.

119
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,616
Now, to be honest with you, Shane...

120
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:19,617
when a blowing from the big smokes
requests to be transferred to my outpost...

121
00:12:19,718 --> 00:12:21,518
I count on two things.

122
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:24,519
Either he's lazy

123
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,620
looking for what he thinks is a cushy bait

124
00:12:27,721 --> 00:12:30,721
or he's an upstart looking for an easy promotion.

125
00:12:31,722 --> 00:12:35,022
"So which one are you?
It's nothing like that, sir.

126
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:41,623
Then what is it?

127
00:12:42,224 --> 00:12:45,024
It's my wife, sir.

128
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,425
We lost...

129
00:12:48,826 --> 00:12:51,526
We lost our last pregnancy at six months.

130
00:12:52,527 --> 00:12:57,027
The doctor said we should move
somewhere quiet, away from the city.

131
00:12:57,428 --> 00:13:00,028
Try and keep her blood pressure down.

132
00:13:22,229 --> 00:13:27,029
And here's something I haven't seen in a while.
The Carlin brothers riding on horseback.

133
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,530
Bill.
What's the occasion, Micky?

134
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:32,531
Gleason lost the herd this morning.

135
00:13:32,632 --> 00:13:35,432
Old Jerry Patrick forgot to shut
the gate again, did he?

136
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:39,433
Oh no, reckon something spooked them bad.
Stampede broke the fence.

137
00:13:40,234 --> 00:13:41,934
Where they head to?

138
00:13:44,435 --> 00:13:47,135
You are not gonna tell anyone,
are you, Billy?

139
00:13:47,836 --> 00:13:49,636
Not unless you don't come back.

140
00:13:53,137 --> 00:13:58,137
This is Shane Cooper
the new Constable.

141
00:14:02,738 --> 00:14:05,938
You boys better try and make it back
before the storm hits.

142
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:08,839
It'll only spook the horses even more if we don't.

143
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,840
Well, be good now.

144
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,041
Are they not allowed
to ride in those mountains?

145
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:25,542
Not since the government bought them off.

146
00:14:26,243 --> 00:14:27,943
Heaven forbid...

147
00:14:28,344 --> 00:14:31,444
Somebody once step on a flatten flower.

148
00:14:36,445 --> 00:14:38,145
Yeah.

149
00:14:43,946 --> 00:14:45,946
Useless.

150
00:14:56,048 --> 00:14:58,248
Good to see that business
is booming, Ted.

151
00:14:58,849 --> 00:15:01,249
Someone's gotta feed Ken's medicine.

152
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,650
Got a look at your file.

153
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:12,851
It's not very poor.

154
00:15:12,952 --> 00:15:14,652
Thank you, sir.

155
00:15:17,653 --> 00:15:19,653
What was the counselling for?

156
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,654
You did that, police counselling.

157
00:15:23,955 --> 00:15:26,155
It was mandatory.
Why?

158
00:15:28,556 --> 00:15:30,556
I was shot on duty, sir.

159
00:15:32,357 --> 00:15:34,157
Post-traumatic stress?

160
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:38,158
No, sir.
Then why did they send you?

161
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,459
I guess they thought it was my fault.

162
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,260
What, you shot yourself?

163
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:46,861
No, sir.

164
00:15:47,562 --> 00:15:48,762
Well, who did?

165
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:51,963
A kid.

166
00:15:54,364 --> 00:15:58,164
He was strung out, he pulled
a concealed weapon, I pulled mine and...

167
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:04,965
You couldn't pull the trigger.
He was just a kid.

168
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,666
He was a kid with a gun.

169
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:11,367
That's one way of looking at it.
Well, what's the other way, Constable?

170
00:16:11,368 --> 00:16:14,368
Well, maybe he needed help,
not a bullet.

171
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,669
What? You disagree, Inspector?

172
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,770
We would be having
a different conversation if you were dead.

173
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:27,771
<i>Bill, come in.
Over.</i>

174
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:32,872
Yeah, it's me. Go ahead.

175
00:16:33,073 --> 00:16:34,573
<i>Quick call from Gleason.</i>

176
00:16:34,574 --> 00:16:37,574
<i>He wants one of us to go out to his property.
Take a look at something.</i>

177
00:16:37,975 --> 00:16:39,875
Is it about the missing horses?

178
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:43,076
<i>Yes, he says he found out
what caused the stampede.</i>

179
00:16:43,077 --> 00:16:45,077
<i>You wanna come by the fort.</i>

180
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:48,578
No. I'll send Cooper up to you.

181
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:52,479
It's about time we brought him in.

182
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,980
Copy that.

183
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:03,681
Once you get to the top of the hill...

184
00:17:04,182 --> 00:17:06,282
There's a communications tower.

185
00:17:06,283 --> 00:17:09,183
Property's six klicks south of that.

186
00:17:11,084 --> 00:17:14,784
Okay. So I'll just take the car out back?

187
00:17:15,085 --> 00:17:17,585
No, that's mine.

188
00:17:19,586 --> 00:17:20,586
Okay.

189
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:23,287
What about the car out front?

190
00:17:23,988 --> 00:17:25,488
Barlow's.

191
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,089
Well, how am I supposed to get to Gleason's property?

192
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,090
Whew.

193
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,591
Mr. Gleason?

194
00:18:18,092 --> 00:18:21,292
<i>Debbie, I understand the breakout
occurred just a few hours ago.</i>

195
00:18:22,193 --> 00:18:23,593
<i>That's right, Richard.</i>

196
00:18:23,594 --> 00:18:25,794
<i>This morning
at approximately 8AM,</i>

197
00:18:25,895 --> 00:18:28,895
<i>a huge explosion ripped through
the southern wall of the facility.</i>

198
00:18:29,395 --> 00:18:31,595
<i>Initially, prison officers
were unsure as to</i>

199
00:18:31,596 --> 00:18:33,896
<i>how many inmates, if any, had escaped.</i>

200
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:39,296
<i>But we can now confirm the identity
of the man the police is searching for.</i>

201
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:42,497
<i>Dural Conway, also known as "Jimmy"...</i>

202
00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:44,398
<i>was convicted of murdering his wife...</i>

203
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:49,399
<i>and the attempted murder
of a Red Hill police officer in 1995.</i>

204
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,200
<i>Conway was sentenced to life in prison.</i>

205
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:55,401
<i>The police are urging the public to not approach the man,</i>

206
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:58,202
<i>as he is considered armed and dangerous.</i>

207
00:18:58,402 --> 00:19:00,102
<i>Thanks very much, Debbie,</i>

208
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:05,003
<i>and we will be giving you all the updates
on the story as they come in.</i>

209
00:19:11,804 --> 00:19:14,304
What kind of animal is capable
of such a thing?

210
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:17,805
It scares me to ponder.

211
00:19:19,006 --> 00:19:22,106
Certainly isn't from anything local.

212
00:19:24,707 --> 00:19:26,607
When I was a kid...

213
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:30,008
My father swore he had seen
a panther up in them hills.

214
00:19:30,909 --> 00:19:34,209
Some of the locals claim
they had seen the same thing.

215
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:39,510
How the hell does a panther
end up roaming high country Australia?

216
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:44,111
Travelling circus, so the story goes.

217
00:19:44,412 --> 00:19:48,512
Apparently two of the bastards
escaped from the show in 1880.

218
00:19:48,713 --> 00:19:50,713
And one of them was pregnant.

219
00:19:52,114 --> 00:19:56,314
Lucky for us, Panthers don't breed like rabbits.

220
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:03,315
I seen you ride in on that horse.

221
00:20:04,616 --> 00:20:06,616
Did Manning put you up to it?

222
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:14,317
That man
was born a bastard.

223
00:20:17,418 --> 00:20:20,018
Just look where you want to go...

224
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,719
and the horse will follow.

225
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,720
Ahem. Ahem.

226
00:21:03,321 --> 00:21:05,521
Come on.

227
00:21:23,822 --> 00:21:26,222
<i>Dural Conway, also known as Jimmy</i>

228
00:21:26,323 --> 00:21:29,323
<i>is approximately 175 cm tall...</i>

229
00:21:30,224 --> 00:21:33,924
<i>of Aboriginal descent, and of
median build with short brown hair.</i>

230
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:37,225
<i>He can be recognized
by the distinct burn scars...</i>

231
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:40,726
<i>along the left hand side
of his face and upper body.</i>

232
00:21:40,927 --> 00:21:43,227
<i>Officials have now confirmed...</i>

233
00:21:43,328 --> 00:21:47,228
<i>that the explosion was caused
by the detonation of a gas line...</i>

234
00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:49,529
<i>leading through the prison wall.</i>

235
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:53,730
<i>Did they know how the inmate
was able to get into the gas line?</i>

236
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:59,431
<i>Yes Richard, following the discovery of
a 3m hole dug into solid concrete.</i>

237
00:21:59,832 --> 00:22:02,132
<i>Prison officers now believe...</i>

238
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:10,533
<i>Prison officials are greatly concerned
for the whereabouts of the suspect...</i>

239
00:22:13,635 --> 00:22:15,535
Barlow?

240
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:17,836
What's going on?

241
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,837
<i>Do we have a history of his previous arrests?</i>

242
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,938
<i>Indeed, Richard.
Convicted of murdering his wife...</i>

243
00:22:22,939 --> 00:22:26,939
<i>and the attempted murder of a
Red Hill police officer in 1995...</i>

244
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,940
<i>Conway was sentenced...</i>

245
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:30,641
Old Bill's the one who put him away.

246
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:33,142
<i>Police are urging the public not to approach the man...</i>

247
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,043
<i>as he is considered armed and dangerous.</i>

248
00:22:35,244 --> 00:22:37,844
Now we all here.

249
00:22:38,245 --> 00:22:40,745
Alright, here is what we know.

250
00:22:41,646 --> 00:22:43,846
Approximately 9 AM today...

251
00:22:44,047 --> 00:22:48,047
Jimmy Conway break out of the
Maximum Security Prison at Western Bay.

252
00:22:49,448 --> 00:22:54,048
45 minutes later, he was spotted
stealing a white 86 Falcon...

253
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:57,249
Registration MKC-489...

254
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,050
from a BP service station in Jackson.

255
00:23:00,351 --> 00:23:02,651
Alright, now...

256
00:23:02,652 --> 00:23:06,552
From Jackson, it's about a six-hour haul to Red Hill.

257
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:11,353
So that gives us exactly two hours
to lock this town down.

258
00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:15,854
Manning, you'll take the freeway exit.

259
00:23:16,555 --> 00:23:21,455
Rex, you'll cover the hard country bypass
in case he takes the scenic route.

260
00:23:21,756 --> 00:23:24,456
My bet is he's gonna try and flank us...

261
00:23:24,657 --> 00:23:27,357
so I'm gonna cover Alpine Drive.

262
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:30,358
So Dale, you ride with me...

263
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:32,759
and Willy, you ride with Manning.

264
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,760
Now, Barlow.
I want you here to monitor the wire.

265
00:23:37,161 --> 00:23:39,161
Alright, you'll feed us if there are any updates.

266
00:23:39,262 --> 00:23:41,162
And you put out a storm warning.

267
00:23:41,163 --> 00:23:44,863
There's a big one hitting our way tonight,
so keep everyone indoors.

268
00:23:45,264 --> 00:23:47,464
Right. Earl, Slim, Ted.

269
00:23:47,965 --> 00:23:50,865
I want you to secure up Main Street.

270
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:55,266
Earl, you good with the scope,
so make sure you get a good vantage point.

271
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:58,467
Kenny.

272
00:23:59,268 --> 00:24:01,568
You stay with Barlow and secure the station,

273
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:05,069
because if he strikes,
this will be the first place he hits.

274
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,170
What's funny?

275
00:24:10,771 --> 00:24:13,471
A bit overkill, Billy?

276
00:24:15,272 --> 00:24:17,272
Jimmy Conway...

277
00:24:17,273 --> 00:24:20,273
was the best bromley tracker
this town ever had.

278
00:24:23,074 --> 00:24:27,974
You'll hold your positions and you'll be armed
at all times. You understand?

279
00:24:32,075 --> 00:24:34,275
Any questions?

280
00:24:34,376 --> 00:24:35,776
What about Gleason?

281
00:24:35,777 --> 00:24:37,577
No, we'll leave him out of this one.

282
00:24:37,578 --> 00:24:39,778
What's he gonna do,
throw his walking cane?

283
00:24:41,678 --> 00:24:44,978
I'd like to know who's gonna
cover Skins Creek Road.

284
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:48,479
Jimmy won't take Skins Creek Road.

285
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,680
What makes you so sure?
Cause I know the way he moves.

286
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:55,081
He'll be after the
smallest track with the most cover.

287
00:24:55,082 --> 00:24:57,782
Maybe he thinks you are thinking that...

288
00:24:57,783 --> 00:25:00,183
so maybe he'll do something different.

289
00:25:00,184 --> 00:25:03,484
No harm posting a man for a piece of mourn, Billy.

290
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,385
Cooper.

291
00:25:14,686 --> 00:25:16,686
You'll cover Skins Creek Road.

292
00:25:16,787 --> 00:25:18,587
Yes, sir.

293
00:25:18,588 --> 00:25:20,988
"Yes, sir."

294
00:25:21,689 --> 00:25:23,589
Everybody armed?

295
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,090
Slim, you need one, right?

296
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,891
Nobody leaves here without a weapon.

297
00:25:31,892 --> 00:25:34,292
That includes you too, Constable.

298
00:25:37,193 --> 00:25:39,293
Give him something.

299
00:25:43,594 --> 00:25:45,194
Alright, the radios.

300
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:48,795
I want everyone to tune into channel four.
If the shit hits the van...

301
00:25:48,996 --> 00:25:52,596
We'll stay off the wire and regroup
at Earl's barn. And listen!

302
00:25:56,497 --> 00:25:59,597
We all know
what we're dealing with here.

303
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:04,298
If Jimmy Conway rides into this town,

304
00:26:04,699 --> 00:26:07,499
he'll be bringing hell with him.

305
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,500
Shoot to kill.

306
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:13,701
Alright, you heard the man.
Move out.

307
00:26:21,102 --> 00:26:24,002
Inspector?

308
00:26:24,003 --> 00:26:27,703
Listen, I don't want to cause
any unnecessary stress, but I just came...

309
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:29,704
from Gleason's Property

310
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,805
and he seems to think there's
a Panther roaming the area.

311
00:26:34,705 --> 00:26:36,205
Jesus, Cooper.

312
00:26:36,706 --> 00:26:39,706
This in Australia, mate.
Not fucking Africa.

313
00:28:31,107 --> 00:28:33,607
Adonis? Adonis.

314
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:44,208
Luca. Luca.

315
00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:52,409
<i>Hey, honey.
Howdy, sheriff.</i>

316
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,910
<i>How's your first day?</i>

317
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:56,811
You know, working hard.

318
00:28:57,612 --> 00:28:59,112
<i>I bet you are.</i>

319
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:01,713
<i>You are never gonna guess
where I found your gun.</i>

320
00:29:01,714 --> 00:29:03,414
<i>It was tucked under the towels...</i>

321
00:29:03,415 --> 00:29:06,215
Good to know. Listen honey,
I'm gonna have to call you back.

322
00:29:06,616 --> 00:29:09,716
<i>Okay, I love you.
Love you too. Bye.</i>

323
00:29:28,817 --> 00:29:30,717
How are we doing today?

324
00:29:32,218 --> 00:29:34,018
<i>Attention all positions.</i>

325
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:36,819
<i>We have just received word
that Conway's getaway vehicle</i>

326
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,820
<i>has been found
abandoned in Winston.</i>

327
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,120
Please, please
put the gun down.

328
00:30:18,621 --> 00:30:21,121
Nobody needs to get hurt, okay?

329
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:26,122
Putting it down, you see.

330
00:30:29,823 --> 00:30:31,323
You gotta let them go.

331
00:30:36,124 --> 00:30:37,124
You want this?

332
00:30:39,425 --> 00:30:42,425
I'm gonna put it down slowly.

333
00:30:47,126 --> 00:30:48,926
Nice and easy. There you go.

334
00:30:51,027 --> 00:30:52,027
Okay.

335
00:30:52,828 --> 00:30:54,328
You gotta let them go now.

336
00:30:56,129 --> 00:30:57,129
You don't need them.

337
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,830
Take it easy.

338
00:31:09,831 --> 00:31:10,831
Easy.

339
00:31:33,332 --> 00:31:36,132
Radio Check. Come in, Cooper. Over.

340
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:42,233
Radio Check. Come in, Cooper. Over.

341
00:31:45,434 --> 00:31:46,934
Cooper, you there?

342
00:31:57,135 --> 00:31:59,535
Bill... look...

343
00:31:59,536 --> 00:32:02,436
I don't want you to start sweating, but...

344
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:07,137
we've lost contact with Cooper.

345
00:32:22,138 --> 00:32:24,838
Jimmy. Mate...

346
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:29,839
look, there's no need...

347
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,840
No...

348
00:36:13,742 --> 00:36:15,742
<i>Barlow, come in, over.</i>

349
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:21,243
<i>Barlow, come in, over.</i>

350
00:36:24,744 --> 00:36:27,144
<i>Barlow, come in.</i>

351
00:36:30,745 --> 00:36:32,745
<i>Barlow, answer your radio.</i>

352
00:36:36,546 --> 00:36:39,546
<i>Goddamn it, Barlow,
answer your fucking radio.</i>

353
00:36:50,947 --> 00:36:56,747
No!
Wait!

354
00:38:22,148 --> 00:38:25,248
Well, after he pulled
down the relay tower...

355
00:38:25,249 --> 00:38:29,649
he softened off the tank
and legged it.

356
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,650
Did he say anything?

357
00:38:31,651 --> 00:38:33,451
No.

358
00:38:35,652 --> 00:38:40,252
Which way did he go?
Headed to town, I suppose.

359
00:39:13,953 --> 00:39:15,553
Fuck.

360
00:39:21,954 --> 00:39:23,754
It's him, Billy...

361
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:26,255
It's fucking him.

362
00:39:26,256 --> 00:39:28,156
<i>Has he seen you?</i>

363
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,257
I don't know.

364
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:34,058
Stay where you are.

365
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:36,759
Manning and I are on our way back.

366
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,060
<i>Rex, you copy that?</i>

367
00:39:39,061 --> 00:39:41,261
<i>I'm moving, I'll be there in ten.</i>

368
00:39:41,262 --> 00:39:44,562
<i>Hold your positions
and stay off the wire.</i>

369
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,463
Please...

370
00:43:12,864 --> 00:43:14,364
I'll give you anything.

371
00:43:17,165 --> 00:43:18,965
Tell me what you want.

372
00:43:54,866 --> 00:43:55,966
Police!

373
00:44:01,167 --> 00:44:02,167
Hello!

374
00:46:42,068 --> 00:46:44,068
Please don't kill me.

375
00:46:49,169 --> 00:46:51,369
I don't want anybody
to get hurt, Jimmy.

376
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:57,070
I promise you, Jimmy.

377
00:46:58,171 --> 00:47:01,971
Please don't kill me, Jimmy.

378
00:47:08,673 --> 00:47:11,673
You black bastard.

379
00:47:24,574 --> 00:47:25,674
Jimmy.

380
00:47:28,975 --> 00:47:30,475
Please Jimmy.

381
00:47:30,676 --> 00:47:32,576
Jimmy, Jimmy, please, Jimmy.

382
00:47:33,677 --> 00:47:35,677
Please, Jimmy. No.

383
00:47:36,278 --> 00:47:37,278
Jimmy.

384
00:47:39,479 --> 00:47:42,079
Please, Jimmy, no, no.

385
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,580
Jimmy, no, Jimmy.

386
00:48:05,281 --> 00:48:09,381
I'm watching them now, Bill.
You are not gonna believe this, man.

387
00:48:09,482 --> 00:48:11,582
He shot him, he shot Slim.

388
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:13,983
<i>He just shot him man.</i>

389
00:48:14,484 --> 00:48:17,484
<i>Rex, I told you
to stay off the fucking wire.</i>

390
00:48:17,985 --> 00:48:18,985
<i>Jimmy</i>

391
00:49:32,686 --> 00:49:33,686
Shit.

392
00:51:18,687 --> 00:51:20,787
Hey.

393
00:51:21,888 --> 00:51:23,088
I'm gonna die.

394
00:51:23,589 --> 00:51:24,589
Don't say that.

395
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:30,690
I'm going to hell.

396
00:51:32,491 --> 00:51:33,691
I know it.

397
00:51:34,892 --> 00:51:36,392
You'll be okay.

398
00:52:12,393 --> 00:52:14,993
What do you think he's doing?

399
00:52:16,394 --> 00:52:17,894
He's waiting for us.

400
00:52:18,795 --> 00:52:20,795
You call flanking him, Bill?

401
00:52:21,696 --> 00:52:23,696
What do you wanna do?

402
00:52:27,197 --> 00:52:29,197
We're moving... on foot.

403
00:53:25,698 --> 00:53:28,498
What's happening?
No. .. no... no...

404
00:53:28,499 --> 00:53:32,499
Easy, easy!
It's me. It's me, Shane.

405
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,600
Barlow. Where's Bill?

406
00:53:34,601 --> 00:53:37,301
He's killing us all...
Where is Bill?

407
00:53:37,302 --> 00:53:39,302
I don't know!
What do you mean, you don't know?

408
00:53:39,503 --> 00:53:41,303
Is he dead?
I don't know, I don't fucking know!

409
00:53:41,704 --> 00:53:44,204
The phones, radios, the mobiles,
nothing's fucking working.

410
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:46,705
It's payback.

411
00:53:46,706 --> 00:53:49,406
Earl's Barn? Do you know where it is?
He's here for payback.

412
00:53:49,407 --> 00:53:51,405
And he won't stop.
Nothing's gonna stop him.

413
00:53:51,407 --> 00:53:53,407
Bill said that if shit hits the van,
we'll make it

414
00:53:53,408 --> 00:53:54,808
to Earl's barn.
He's hunting us down like dogs.

415
00:53:55,009 --> 00:53:56,809
Where the fuck is Earl's barn?!

416
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:14,910
Oh fuck.

417
00:55:18,411 --> 00:55:20,411
Oh fuck me.

418
00:55:21,712 --> 00:55:23,612
What is it?
Billy.

419
00:55:23,713 --> 00:55:25,813
Oh fuck.

420
00:55:28,914 --> 00:55:31,414
Oh shit.

421
00:56:05,315 --> 00:56:06,615
You gonna keep quiet, okay?

422
00:56:07,616 --> 00:56:08,916
Don't leave me here.

423
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:11,617
I'll come back for you.
Please, please.

424
00:56:14,918 --> 00:56:16,118
I don't want to die.

425
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:22,219
You aren't die.
No, you don't understand.

426
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:24,720
He's gonna kill us all.

427
00:56:29,021 --> 00:56:30,321
Shane, please, mate.

428
00:56:38,822 --> 00:56:40,022
Here.

429
00:56:41,723 --> 00:56:43,223
Don't fucking move.

430
00:56:56,824 --> 00:56:58,024
Fuck!

431
00:56:59,225 --> 00:57:01,125
I'm going out...

432
00:57:01,426 --> 00:57:04,326
What the fuck do we do?
We're pinned.

433
00:57:08,327 --> 00:57:09,327
Shit.

434
00:57:23,229 --> 00:57:25,229
Go, go, go, go!

435
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:36,030
No.

436
01:06:36,532 --> 01:06:38,732
I saw him Bill,
with my own eyes.

437
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:41,833
He's hunting us like fucking dogs.

438
01:06:42,234 --> 01:06:44,234
Where's Earl?
Dead.

439
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:48,235
What about Rex?

440
01:06:49,236 --> 01:06:50,736
We are all that's left.

441
01:06:50,737 --> 01:06:51,937
He's here for payback.

442
01:06:52,938 --> 01:06:54,738
If we don't stop him,
we are all gonna die!

443
01:06:56,539 --> 01:06:59,639
You think you can scream any louder?

444
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,240
We gotta do something, Bill.

445
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:08,741
Dale, get the horses.

446
01:07:09,842 --> 01:07:11,742
Where's the backup, Bill?

447
01:07:11,843 --> 01:07:13,743
We'll play him in his own game.

448
01:07:13,844 --> 01:07:15,944
We stop running.
We start hunting.

449
01:07:15,945 --> 01:07:18,945
Bill, where's the backup?

450
01:07:19,546 --> 01:07:20,746
There isn't any.

451
01:07:21,147 --> 01:07:23,147
He's taken out all communications.

452
01:07:24,348 --> 01:07:26,348
Surely, we can send
somebody for help?

453
01:07:26,349 --> 01:07:28,549
Nearest town is an hour's ride.

454
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:29,850
So?

455
01:07:29,851 --> 01:07:32,851
So we deal with
this fucking situation ourselves!

456
01:07:34,352 --> 01:07:35,552
He's right, Bill.

457
01:07:35,953 --> 01:07:37,953
Listen to him.
We have to have backup.

458
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:41,454
We got a convicted murderer out there
killing every men in this town

459
01:07:41,455 --> 01:07:42,955
and you're suggesting
we don't call it in?

460
01:07:43,144 --> 01:07:44,144
Yes.

461
01:07:45,657 --> 01:07:48,057
Old Gleason's got a
satellite phone.

462
01:07:48,658 --> 01:07:51,658
We can use that for backup.
Shut up, Barlow.

463
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:55,659
He does,
he uses it for emergencies.

464
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:57,060
I'm calling it in.

465
01:07:57,661 --> 01:07:58,861
No, you're not.

466
01:08:10,062 --> 01:08:11,562
The hell's going on here?

467
01:08:16,863 --> 01:08:18,063
You tell me, son.

468
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:23,664
Jimmy Conway killed every
local you put up against him.

469
01:08:25,765 --> 01:08:27,565
But when he came to me...

470
01:08:27,766 --> 01:08:29,966
He dropped me to the
outskirts of the town.

471
01:08:30,367 --> 01:08:32,567
Now, why do you think that is?

472
01:08:32,968 --> 01:08:36,968
If you got something to say, you go right ahead and say it.

473
01:08:38,569 --> 01:08:39,769
Billy?

474
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:41,870
Barlow's died.

475
01:08:47,671 --> 01:08:48,871
Dale...

476
01:08:49,672 --> 01:08:50,972
saddle up three horses.

477
01:08:51,673 --> 01:08:53,173
Turn the others loose.

478
01:08:55,274 --> 01:08:57,674
Seems Cooper here won't be joining us.

479
01:09:03,775 --> 01:09:07,675
That's a mighty fast draw
for someone who's never shot a bullet.

480
01:09:11,476 --> 01:09:12,876
One sec.

481
01:09:14,277 --> 01:09:18,177
Constable here hasn't got the nerve
to pull the trigger, do you son?

482
01:09:22,678 --> 01:09:23,878
Come on.

483
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:28,679
Come on.

484
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:56,980
Come on.

485
01:13:01,581 --> 01:13:02,681
Come on!

486
01:13:05,082 --> 01:13:07,882
Fuck! Fuck!

487
01:13:29,883 --> 01:13:33,183
Just look where you want to go.

488
01:14:09,284 --> 01:14:10,484
Mr. Gleason!

489
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:18,285
Mr. Gleason!

490
01:14:21,186 --> 01:14:22,186
Mr. Gleason!

491
01:14:35,187 --> 01:14:37,687
<i>This is High Country patrol,
Please state your emergency.</i>

492
01:14:37,688 --> 01:14:41,188
This is officer Shane Cooper
of Red Hill District 208.

493
01:14:41,289 --> 01:14:43,389
I'm requesting immediate backup.

494
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:46,590
We have an escapee Jimmy Conway
roaming the area.

495
01:14:46,891 --> 01:14:49,091
He's heavily armed and on the loose.

496
01:14:49,192 --> 01:14:51,192
We've lost all communications.

497
01:14:51,193 --> 01:14:54,293
One officer is dead
along with several civilians.

498
01:14:54,594 --> 01:14:56,894
I'm requesting immediate backup.
Over.

499
01:14:57,095 --> 01:15:00,095
<i>Received, 208.
What is the current location of the suspect?</i>

500
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:05,396
I don't know. I don't know.
He's roaming the whole fucking area.

501
01:15:05,497 --> 01:15:09,197
Look. Just send all available units
and send them...

502
01:15:09,498 --> 01:15:10,198
No.

503
01:15:15,699 --> 01:15:16,899
Mr. Gleason!

504
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:22,900
Mr. Gleason!

505
01:15:25,901 --> 01:15:27,101
Mr. Gleason?

506
01:15:30,202 --> 01:15:31,702
He's out there, isn't he?

507
01:15:35,703 --> 01:15:38,403
When I saw on the news
that he had escaped...

508
01:15:38,504 --> 01:15:41,604
I knew he would come for us.
Why don't you step down from there...

509
01:15:41,605 --> 01:15:44,105
and we could talk about this?
No.

510
01:15:45,406 --> 01:15:49,106
This is something I should
have done a long time ago.

511
01:15:51,307 --> 01:15:53,307
He's an innocent man, Shane.

512
01:15:56,408 --> 01:15:58,508
What are you saying?

513
01:15:58,609 --> 01:16:00,609
<i>Fifteen years ago...</i>

514
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:04,210
<i>the government was
buying up the land.</i>

515
01:16:04,611 --> 01:16:07,611
<i>They were going to cut a train line
through the mountains.</i>

516
01:16:08,212 --> 01:16:11,312
<i>But Jimmy found
a sacred burial site.</i>

517
01:16:11,513 --> 01:16:13,513
<i>Bill tried to stop him,</i>

518
01:16:14,514 --> 01:16:17,214
<i>but Jimmy went public.</i>

519
01:16:17,715 --> 01:16:19,915
What did you do?

520
01:16:25,416 --> 01:16:27,616
What did you do?

521
01:16:36,517 --> 01:16:37,817
I've written everything down...

522
01:16:39,618 --> 01:16:41,118
exactly as I remembered.

523
01:18:21,719 --> 01:18:24,119
Shane?

524
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:26,920
Hey

525
01:18:29,421 --> 01:18:31,221
How's your day?

526
01:18:32,322 --> 01:18:34,322
It was great.

527
01:18:37,123 --> 01:18:39,123
You cut your face.

528
01:18:40,324 --> 01:18:42,324
Oh, it's just a scratch.

529
01:18:44,225 --> 01:18:46,525
The Inspector's got us
rounding up cattle.

530
01:18:56,226 --> 01:18:57,726
I'm sorry that we had to move.

531
01:19:11,427 --> 01:19:13,527
Don't you ever say that...

532
01:19:13,928 --> 01:19:16,528
because we're in this together.

533
01:19:18,229 --> 01:19:20,129
All three of us.

534
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:26,530
He has been kicking like crazy tonight.

535
01:19:31,531 --> 01:19:34,331
Your dinner's in the fridge.

536
01:19:34,732 --> 01:19:36,432
I'll eat when I get back.

537
01:19:36,433 --> 01:19:38,833
Are you going out again?
I have to.

538
01:19:40,434 --> 01:19:43,534
Why did you come home for?

539
01:19:45,235 --> 01:19:47,235
You.

540
01:19:52,836 --> 01:19:54,936
Bye.

541
01:20:01,537 --> 01:20:03,237
Shane?

542
01:20:08,238 --> 01:20:10,338
Be careful, cowboy.

543
01:21:06,839 --> 01:21:08,439
Spread out, boys.

544
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:10,940
We bring him to us.

545
01:23:14,141 --> 01:23:16,041
Dale?

546
01:23:18,642 --> 01:23:20,342
Dale?

547
01:23:32,943 --> 01:23:35,243
Jimmy...

548
01:23:35,444 --> 01:23:38,144
I got a wife now.

549
01:23:49,445 --> 01:23:51,045
Manning?

550
01:23:51,846 --> 01:23:53,646
Dale

551
01:24:02,747 --> 01:24:06,247
Come on, Jimmy.
I know you're out there!

552
01:24:55,448 --> 01:24:58,648
You wanna know whether she survived?

553
01:25:00,049 --> 01:25:03,249
You kill me,
you'll never know.

554
01:25:09,450 --> 01:25:12,050
If it isn't the black killer himself!

555
01:25:16,151 --> 01:25:19,951
Didn't count on seeing you
for another 30 years, Jimmy.

556
01:25:23,352 --> 01:25:25,652
Don't tell me they've let you loose.

557
01:25:34,053 --> 01:25:37,353
Want me to make a citizen's arrest,
Billy?

558
01:25:37,954 --> 01:25:40,654
Throw the book at him.

559
01:25:40,855 --> 01:25:43,755
I don't know what I like doing more...

560
01:25:44,856 --> 01:25:48,756
Killing you or nailing your fucking wife.

561
01:25:48,757 --> 01:25:51,157
You best put that gun down.

562
01:25:57,258 --> 01:25:59,858
What the fuck are you doing, Cooper?

563
01:26:00,959 --> 01:26:03,259
I'm taking you in, Bill.

564
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:08,160
You put the gun down. That's an order!

565
01:26:08,361 --> 01:26:11,261
You... and your friends...

566
01:26:11,362 --> 01:26:15,862
are under arrest for the rape
and murder of Ellin Conway.

567
01:26:24,963 --> 01:26:28,863
You don't know what you're talking about.

568
01:26:32,664 --> 01:26:36,764
I've got a sworn statement, right here.

569
01:26:44,465 --> 01:26:47,265
<i>After Jimmy stopped the train line...</i>

570
01:26:47,666 --> 01:26:50,466
<i>You rounded up a posse
for retribution.</i>

571
01:26:55,067 --> 01:26:57,667
<i>But there was only so much Jimmy could take.</i>

572
01:27:18,568 --> 01:27:21,468
<i>You beat him, shot him...</i>

573
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:23,869
<i>and burned.</i>

574
01:27:29,970 --> 01:27:33,470
<i>But you didn't kill him, did you, Bill.</i>

575
01:27:35,071 --> 01:27:36,971
So you had your men...

576
01:27:36,972 --> 01:27:38,472
your boys...

577
01:27:38,573 --> 01:27:42,373
testify against him for
a murder he didn't commit.

578
01:27:51,374 --> 01:27:53,974
Nice story, kid.

579
01:27:54,275 --> 01:27:56,975
But, you got no evidence.

580
01:27:58,476 --> 01:28:01,976
You buried her on top of Eagle's Ridge.

581
01:28:05,577 --> 01:28:08,077
Shane!

582
01:28:08,078 --> 01:28:11,478
You put that gun down
or I'll have you shot!

583
01:28:17,279 --> 01:28:18,979
He's bluffing, boys.

584
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:21,680
Go ahead, shoot him.

585
01:28:21,881 --> 01:28:25,081
You don't have the balls
to pull the trigger.

586
01:28:58,282 --> 01:29:00,682
Who the fuck are you?

587
01:29:01,083 --> 01:29:04,383
You know nothing
about this town.

588
01:29:06,584 --> 01:29:08,584
I know the law.

589
01:29:08,685 --> 01:29:10,885
You're not the law in this town.

590
01:29:10,886 --> 01:29:12,286
I am!

591
01:29:12,287 --> 01:29:15,487
This is my town!
My town!

592
01:29:23,788 --> 01:29:26,988
I got Jimmy a chance,
but no...

593
01:29:27,389 --> 01:29:29,589
he wanted to be a hero!

594
01:29:29,890 --> 01:29:31,990
And for what?

595
01:29:32,791 --> 01:29:35,791
Bones in the fucking ground!

596
01:29:53,692 --> 01:29:56,492
Jimmy?

597
01:29:57,693 --> 01:29:59,693
Jimmy!

598
01:30:05,794 --> 01:30:08,494
You don't have to do this.

599
01:30:11,295 --> 01:30:15,295
Come on, kill me. Come on!

600
01:31:24,996 --> 01:31:28,896
We were going to have a boy.

601
01:31:29,305 --> 01:32:29,780
