00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,548
Did you save your patient,
Daddy?

3
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:12,989
Of course.

4
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,650
You know I'm the best.

5
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,661
Sure.
And me?

6
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,891
You're the best
at being naughty.

7
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,990
Something else.

8
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:25,002
Something else?
Hold on...

9
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:27,368
You're the best little girl
in the world.

10
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,601
Give me your hand.

11
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,612
I'll deliver my invitations
after lunch.

12
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,047
Your party's in two weeks.

13
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,550
Come with me.

14
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,620
Princess, I'm beat.

15
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,052
Ask Mom.
She'll help you.

16
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,852
No, I want to go with you.

17
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,484
Daddy's tired, Jasmine.

18
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,825
After school, okay?

19
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,228
No, I'll just do it by myself.

20
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,601
I didn't get my dessert.

21
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,211
My dessert.

22
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,405
Thank you.

23
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,614
There.

24
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:19,317
If no one's home, leave
the invitations in the mailbox.

25
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,622
I know, Daddy.

26
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,323
I love you.

27
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,028
I'm beat.
I need sleep.

28
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,730
Unplug the phone on your way.

29
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,604
I'm only going in 15 minutes.
We have time.

30
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,301
Sylvie, I'm exhausted.

31
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,574
You can just lie there.
I'll take it from there.

32
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:00,950
Hi.

33
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,052
I brought Jasmine her homework.

34
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,630
What do you mean?

35
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,723
She wasn't at school
this afternoon.

36
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,563
Is she sick?

37
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,603
No.

38
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,831
- You didn't see her?
- No.

39
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,071
Thanks.

40
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,504
Jasmine?

41
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,158
Why didn't they call?

42
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,669
They left a message

43
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,798
asking why she wasn't in school
after lunch.

44
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:49,966
Didn't you answer?

45
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,408
I was asleep.
You know.

46
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,847
When did you wake up?

47
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,646
Around 2:30.

48
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,948
And you only listened to it now?

49
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:16,658
Do you normally drive her
to school?

50
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,431
No, she usually goes on her own.

51
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,030
Does she walk with anyone,
a friend?

52
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,403
- Not today.
- Not today.

53
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,501
How was she?
What was she wearing?

54
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:32,744
She was wearing a plaid skirt
and gray tights with boots.

55
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,547
Brown boots with...

56
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,349
She was carrying invitations.

57
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,686
Did she have a hat
or a schoolbag?

58
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:43,125
- A white coat with fur.
- She had a braid.

59
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,322
Thank you.

60
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,408
Should we follow her route
to school?

61
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,240
Sure.

62
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,974
We could go to the park,
ask her friends.

63
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,572
We can go right now.

64
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,879
Yes.

65
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:18,427
In case she calls.

66
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,295
We'll find her.
We'll find her.

67
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:45,214
She's always with Benoit,
who lives there.

68
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:49,590
- We'll find her.
- Or in the field in back.

69
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,390
You go here, I'll go there.

70
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:55,661
She never does this.
She usually calls or...

71
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,699
Does she know people there?

72
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,968
She has friends.
She's always with them.

73
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,838
We'll look over there.

74
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,434
Jasmine?

75
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:24,161
Roger.
Yes?

76
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,831
Dr. Hamel, stay here!
Dr. Hamel!

77
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:32,200
Dr. Hamel, stop!

78
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,932
Don't go there, Dr. Hamel.

79
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,032
Don't go there.
Don't go there.

80
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:45,062
"7 DAYS"

81
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,255
Dr. Hamel?

82
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,825
Detective Sergeant Mercure
speaking.

83
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:54,094
Sorry to bother you
at this difficult time.

84
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:02,069
We think we've found
your little girl's murderer.

85
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,607
Murderer?

86
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,708
We have solid
material evidence.

87
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:18,518
Plus we analyzed the DNA
of the sperm we found.

88
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:23,527
It matches the suspect's DNA.

89
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,689
In my opinion, the trial
will be a formality.

90
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,370
Hello?

91
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,633
Dr. Hamel?

92
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:49,745
Step aside, please!
Step aside.

93
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,119
Do you have anything to say?

94
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:56,388
A new twist in the case
of 8-year-old Jasmine Hamel

95
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:59,487
found raped and murdered
four days ago.

96
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,862
Already the police have found
enough evidence

97
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:05,095
to arrest a prime suspect.

98
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,105
He is a 31 -year-old laborer
named Anthony Lemaire,

99
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:11,938
who moved to Drummondville
a few months ago.

100
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,877
He'd previously lived
in St. Hyacinthe,

101
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,073
where he was charged
for sexual assault.

102
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,844
He was released
for lack of evidence.

103
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,614
But now,
in the case of Jasmine Hamel,

104
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:26,157
the evidence seems
more conclusive.

105
00:15:57,056 --> 00:16:01,823
How long will he get?

106
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,862
About 15 to 25 years.

107
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,492
25 years.

108
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,996
Where are you going?

109
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,838
The hospital.

110
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:56,643
Work will do me good.

111
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,580
So soon?

112
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:05,455
Maybe you should go back
to the gallery.

113
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:08,025
It'll help you forget.

114
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,490
I don't want to forget!

115
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,802
See you tonight.

116
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:24,512
This isn't for
a friendly game of poker.

117
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,447
Not asking questions
and keeping your trap shut

118
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:29,384
is part of the contract.

119
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,922
It sounds kind of suspicious.

120
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:36,154
This is a small town here,
Mister...

121
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,695
I told you,
it won't happen here.

122
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,228
How long can I think it over?

123
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,428
20 seconds.

124
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,062
There are other towns,
other handymen.

125
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,698
$25,000.

126
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,141
$20,000.

127
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:23,498
How are you spending your days?

128
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,872
You know, I'm at the hospital.

129
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:32,273
That's not true.

130
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:35,444
I called.

131
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:39,513
I even left messages
on your cell.

132
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:42,218
That's right.

133
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,591
You never listen to messages.

134
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,408
What I'm asking is simple.

135
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:00,945
For two minutes' work
you pocket $10,000.

136
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:05,073
Think fast.

137
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:07,743
$5,000 now, $5,000 after.

138
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:37,644
$20,000, as agreed.

139
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,718
Plus $10,000 a day
if you don't talk.

140
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,086
What?

141
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:48,148
Every day I'll call to say
where the money is for a week.

142
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,818
Unless you talk.

143
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,829
If you talk, I'll know.

144
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:57,300
$10,000 a day?

145
00:23:57,402 --> 00:24:01,031
You can be sure I won't talk.

146
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,606
We won't meet again.

147
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:48,610
"DAY ONE"

148
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:18,040
Dan, are you all right?

149
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:20,549
Wake up! Wake up!

150
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:23,177
Open your eyes, come on!

151
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,051
- What is it?
- Can I help?

152
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,818
I'm a doctor.

153
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,554
He blacked out.
I don't know what's wrong.

154
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:43,197
Get him out.
He needs air.

155
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:44,900
- What happened?
- I don't know.

156
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,274
He just fainted.

157
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:54,117
Hold him up.
I'll get my bag.

158
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,950
Dan, talk to me!
Open your eyes!

159
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:23,278
What are we doing here?

160
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:30,619
Where are we, fuck?

161
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:01,777
The driver is being questioned.

162
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,206
We located the van.

163
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,867
Your husband drugged him.

164
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,413
The driver lost consciousness.

165
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,846
We don't know
how he pulled it off.

166
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,147
What's he trying to do?

167
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:38,984
We expect to find Lemaire's
corpse within a few hours.

168
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,150
No, impossible.
That's not like Bruno.

169
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,827
So you don't know anything?

170
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,929
No.

171
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,031
You said your husband
has been out a lot.

172
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:00,771
I thought he was going...

173
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,040
That he...

174
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,912
That he what?

175
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,349
I don't know.

176
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,253
Do you always know
where your wife is?

177
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,589
My wife is dead.

178
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:10,537
You don't know
where he might be hiding?

179
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:13,082
A hotel, a country place,
a cottage?

180
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,345
No.

181
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:19,389
We wanted to buy something,
but we never got very far.

182
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,394
I want you to write down
everyone you know.

183
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,763
Relatives, friends, everyone.

184
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,996
We'll question his colleagues
at the hospital.

185
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:39,072
You understand,
we have to tap your phone.

186
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,342
Shit!

187
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,900
What's going on?

188
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:23,229
Why am I tied up like this?

189
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:28,942
What is this?

190
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,010
You bastard!

191
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,280
What do you want?

192
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:49,324
What's going on?

193
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:54,235
What do you want?

194
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,637
Who are you, damn it?

195
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:17,827
It wasn't me, man!

196
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,898
I swear, it wasn't me.

197
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:27,435
Wait till my trial, you'll see.

198
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,597
It wasn't me.

199
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:36,476
Man, look me in the eyes!

200
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:42,013
It wasn't me, fuck!

201
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,784
I've never seen your daughter.

202
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:49,257
I didn't do anything!

203
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,828
Untie me, we can talk.

204
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:02,001
I'll help you.

205
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,074
I'll help you, man.

206
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:07,372
I'll help you find
the real killer.

207
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:10,208
I hate pedophiles too,
just like you!

208
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:13,442
I hate the bastards!

209
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,951
What are you doing?

210
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:22,286
What are you gonna do?

211
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,520
Stop fucking around.

212
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:25,994
Stop joking!

213
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,955
Fuck!

214
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,125
I can't last like this!

215
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:38,429
You can't do this.

216
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,678
Jesus Christ!

217
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:53,875
You're sick, fuck.

218
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:07,190
Shit!

219
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,823
Don't leave me like this.

220
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:20,704
Fuck you, you sick bastard!

221
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,821
Sick piece of shit!

222
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,095
The security cameras
caught this

223
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:53,405
right after Lemaire
entered the courthouse.

224
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:56,480
"DAY TWO"

225
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:07,089
Have you found out who it is?

226
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:10,183
We're working on it.

227
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:34,807
Go to hell!

228
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,319
It wasn't me, shit!

229
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,386
It wasn't me, shit!

230
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,379
Goddammit!

231
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:09,749
You're committing
a major injustice, man.

232
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:12,584
It's you who'll go to jail,
you asshole.

233
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,494
A stunning development
in the Jasmine Hamel case.

234
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:08,094
Her father, Bruno Hamel,
is believed

235
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,696
to have kidnapped
the prime suspect.

236
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,537
We have no other details
for now.

237
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:58,952
If I were Hamel,
I'd cut off his balls.

238
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:02,116
And make sure he was conscious
while I did.

239
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:15,894
Hello?

240
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:19,703
Yesterday I wrecked his knee.

241
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:23,906
That's just the beginning.

242
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:27,108
It's your turn.
Tell me what to do next.

243
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:31,882
I want you to stop
and come home.

244
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:36,856
I was hoping you'd understand.

245
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:40,727
No one approves
of what you're doing.

246
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,197
Your family, your friends.

247
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,530
I don't care.
Fuck 'em.

248
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:51,268
It's for Jasmine.
I owe it to her.

249
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:54,105
You also think I owe it to her.

250
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:56,645
I didn't say that.

251
00:41:56,747 --> 00:42:01,514
You also think I owe her a debt.

252
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:05,055
You have to come home, Bruno.

253
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:06,213
We'll help each other.

254
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:07,722
I hoped you'd see.

255
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,690
This is
Detective Sergeant Mercure,

256
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:11,522
Dr. Hamel.

257
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:16,157
If you turn yourself in now,
the mitigating circumstances...

258
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:20,260
I'll turn myself in.

259
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,932
Next Friday,
my daughter's birthday.

260
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,235
I'm going to kill him.

261
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:26,741
I'll turn myself in after.

262
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:29,244
We'll find you before.

263
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:31,371
I don't think so.

264
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:34,144
You're not a violent man,
Dr. Hamel.

265
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,481
Not fundamentally.
I know it.

266
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:40,056
What else do you know?

267
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:41,215
What you're feeling.

268
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:47,524
I'd be surprised.

269
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:50,657
My wife was shot six months ago
in a grocery

270
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:55,398
by a young thief
for 58 bucks.

271
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,667
Didn't you want to kill him?

272
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:58,833
Yes.

273
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,741
But I knew it was pointless.

274
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,075
Where is he?

275
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:11,786
In prison, where he belongs.

276
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:17,392
And that satisfies you?

277
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:20,486
At night,
lying in your big empty bed,

278
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:25,865
does it console you to know
your wife's killer is in jail?

279
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,462
Does it make your life
more bearable?

280
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:46,987
Bye, Sylvie.

281
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,195
The trace failed.

282
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:42,438
Wait till I get out of here!

283
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:45,913
Wait till I get out of here,
asshole!

284
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,489
"DAY THREE"

285
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:42,013
Pleau, it's Mercure.

286
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:45,020
My ring rolled under the door.
Can you get it?

287
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:46,953
Why don't you do it?

288
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:48,752
Without my ring, Pleau,

289
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:51,555
I can't face it.

290
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:29,592
I put the board back
like it was.

291
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,227
Thanks.

292
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:36,773
Hervי, you should...

293
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:42,511
A Drummondville electronics
salesman recognized Hamel.

294
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:46,810
The doctor bought $4,000 worth
of stuff, including a laptop.

295
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:49,317
A laptop?

296
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:55,290
I didn't know why
he wanted to get in, I swear.

297
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:58,020
It only took a minute.
He went in, came out...

298
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:01,996
I saw Bruno once
at the hospital.

299
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:04,659
I didn't expect him
to come to work so soon.

300
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:07,965
Hamel paid me
to crack the van door.

301
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:10,232
There's not a lock
I can't open.

302
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:15,808
Surgical instruments,

303
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:18,472
antibiotics,

304
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:20,948
even an artificial respirator.

305
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:22,780
They all went missing
last week.

306
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:25,354
After he paid me,

307
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:27,855
he sat in the parking lot...

308
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:32,054
He's such a calm man,
so gentle.

309
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:35,097
I must say,

310
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,530
I find it hard to believe.

311
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:40,262
You're not gonna charge me.

312
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,769
I learned my lesson.

313
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:46,002
Besides, I was cool.
I told you everything I know.

314
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:49,237
It's your turn to be cool.

315
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:52,315
Seriously,
I have to get to school.

316
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,790
The food's so I last longer?

317
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,913
I'm telling the truth.

318
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:30,783
Leave me alone.

319
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:32,855
Want me to confess,
is that it?

320
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:44,659
I did it.

321
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:50,035
I did it, man!
I confess.

322
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,869
But I'm sorry!

323
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:58,271
Shit, I'm so sorry.
So sorry!

324
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:06,482
I don't know why I did it.

325
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:09,616
I'm sorry, man!

326
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,227
I'm sorry.

327
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:35,908
I confessed, shit.

328
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:39,147
Isn't that what you wanted?

329
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,554
I'll say it again to the judge.

330
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,286
I'll be behind bars for years,
you can be sure.

331
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:55,294
I confessed, shit!

332
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:59,136
Stop! Stop!

333
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:09,483
I'll go to jail for life.

334
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:11,417
What more do you want?

335
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:29,730
I'll do anything you want!
Anything!

336
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:29,788
All right,

337
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:33,801
to summarize,

338
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:36,098
Hamel wants to torture the guy
undisturbed.

339
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,037
Where does he go?

340
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:40,632
A cottage?
He doesn't have one.

341
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:42,109
A motel room?

342
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:43,611
We'll keep searching,

343
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,476
but in a radius
of 100 kilometers,

344
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,982
there's a shitload of 'em.

345
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:50,348
A motel's not the place
to torture a guy,

346
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,250
too many people around.

347
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:55,290
So back to a cottage.

348
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:57,553
Did he break into
a friend's place?

349
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:59,390
We checked all the cottages

350
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:03,830
of his colleagues,
friends, relatives.

351
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:06,163
All right.

352
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:15,303
Maybe he rented one?

353
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:17,744
That's risky too.

354
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:23,149
Even if he paid cash,
the owner might remember him.

355
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:26,154
That leaves the abandoned cabin
in the woods.

356
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:29,453
Did he find it by accident?
Did he have it built?

357
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:33,256
In the woods...
Where?

358
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:36,560
Christ, we got nothing!

359
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,600
Does it really matter?

360
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:42,103
After all,
Lemaire's a child rapist.

361
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:44,673
Why should we bust our ass

362
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:47,766
to save a guy
who murders little girls?

363
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:52,638
It's not Lemaire
I want to save.

364
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:06,854
"DAY FOUR"

365
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:39,628
There's no point torturing me.

366
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:44,858
It won't bring back
your little girl.

367
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:11,153
After you finish me off,

368
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,456
what'll you do?

369
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,187
Only three days left
till the deadline runs out,

370
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:54,627
and still no sign
of Bruno Hamel.

371
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:57,825
How is the doctor's wife,
Mrs. Sylvie Bיrubי,

372
00:58:57,934 --> 00:58:59,959
coping with
this difficult situation?

373
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:03,038
Jean Fafard spoke with her.

374
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:07,508
It's hard.
I have nothing to say.

375
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:10,579
You don't approve
of his actions?

376
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:14,378
I think...

377
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:17,920
I think that his grief
has driven him mad.

378
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:19,113
I'm sorry.

379
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,917
Mrs. Bיrubי?

380
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:22,389
In the Middle East...

381
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:25,893
What made you tell the press
I've gone crazy?

382
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:28,088
I'm not crazy;
I've never been so lucid.

383
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:30,028
Come back.
Stop all this.

384
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:32,260
How can you ask that?

385
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:34,632
How can you
ask that?

386
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,706
If you loved Jasmine,
you'd know this is for her.

387
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:40,332
You're doing it out of guilt.

388
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:43,606
You finally said it.
You think it's my fault, right?

389
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:45,442
- It's you who...
- Who what?

390
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:46,947
You could've gone with her.

391
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,881
But you wanted to fuck!

392
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:50,816
While you were having
your orgasm,

393
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,888
your little girl
was being raped.

394
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:56,652
If you'd answered the phone
or listened to the message,

395
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:57,691
maybe...

396
00:59:57,794 --> 00:59:59,625
Maybe!
Screw your maybes!

397
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:01,162
Should we just hide in a corner
and cry?

398
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,892
I'm doing something, Sylvie!

399
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:25,514
They're really going at it.

400
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,283
He was calling
from St. Julie.

401
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:32,157
Trace the call.
He's losing it.

402
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:34,456
Anyone would lose it
if a loved one was murdered.

403
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:38,091
Fine, but we have to
capitalize on it.

404
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:43,138
Concentrate on cottage rental
agencies around St. Julie.

405
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:46,697
Search every home
recently occupied, one by one.

406
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:54,837
All my life

407
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:58,209
has been marked by violence.

408
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:02,982
And more of it

409
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:06,317
isn't going to help me.

410
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:13,060
When I was a kid,

411
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:16,188
I was abused and beaten.

412
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:18,460
I know what it is to suffer.

413
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:25,966
I need help, man!

414
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:30,102
Help, not more violence!

415
01:02:39,655 --> 01:02:42,089
What's that?

416
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:44,056
What is it?

417
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,561
Curare?

418
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:50,530
It's to...

419
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:59,700
"CURARE: PARALYZES THE MOTOR
SYSTEM BUT NOT CONSClOUSNESS."

420
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:19,053
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

421
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:36,269
I can't take it.

422
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:45,119
You're worse than me.

423
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:48,019
You're worse than me!

424
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:38,613
"DAY FlVE"

425
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:07,481
I figured out what you did.

426
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,175
Fuck your food!

427
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:13,119
I'm not gonna shit out
my stomach again.

428
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:18,983
So?

429
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:23,429
What do you got planned now?

430
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:25,659
How you gonna amuse yourself?

431
01:08:30,339 --> 01:08:32,899
Go on,

432
01:08:33,008 --> 01:08:35,340
I can't wait to see.

433
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:47,581
Worst thing is, you don't even
seem to be enjoying yourself.

434
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:58,359
Finished already?

435
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:57,949
Running low on motivation?

436
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:05,026
I'll help you, okay?

437
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:08,528
Your daughter
wasn't the only one.

438
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:14,502
Those little sluts...

439
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:16,833
I killed three others too.

440
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:23,034
Marion Houle,

441
01:11:23,145 --> 01:11:26,137
Laurie Thibodeau,

442
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:30,184
and Charlotte Masson.

443
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,186
I fucked 'em,

444
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:35,746
and then I killed 'em,
all three.

445
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:46,895
But your little girl,

446
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:49,300
Jasmine...

447
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:52,932
She was the best.

448
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:56,034
She was the prettiest.
Real pretty.

449
01:11:56,145 --> 01:12:00,411
Fucking tease!

450
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:03,542
The way she was dressed.

451
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:06,553
She deserved to get her
cunt reamed.

452
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:13,256
While I was fucking her,

453
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:14,920
she kept calling you.

454
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:18,830
She said,

455
01:12:18,934 --> 01:12:23,064
"Daddy! Daddy!"

456
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:26,573
Where were you?
Where were you?

457
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:39,512
Kill me.
Kill me!

458
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:39,111
Hervי?

459
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:42,047
It's Hamel on two.
He wants to talk to you.

460
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:02,000
Yes, Dr. Hamel?

461
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:05,437
You didn't answer last time.

462
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:08,442
What was the question?

463
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:12,878
The fact that your wife's
murderer is in prison,

464
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:15,211
does that make life
more bearable?

465
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:21,422
No.

466
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:28,459
Too bad we didn't talk before.

467
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:30,862
It's too bad, yeah.

468
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:40,541
I don't know why I called.
I shouldn't have.

469
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:42,940
That's not true.

470
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:45,775
You know why.

471
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:48,782
I can help you.

472
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:55,189
You can't even help yourself.

473
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:57,724
You're drowning, Dr. Hamel.

474
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:01,728
And you're starting
to realize it.

475
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:05,561
Yeah.

476
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:07,897
Let me sink.

477
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:17,370
The trace worked.
We'll be there in two minutes.

478
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:20,073
Bolduc and his men
are already in the area.

479
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,877
How precise is it?

480
01:15:21,984 --> 01:15:23,144
Within 50 meters.

481
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:26,050
They only need to search
a few houses.

482
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:30,653
Montrיal.

483
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:33,455
No.

484
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:39,457
We've got the address.
Bolduc's on his way.

485
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:00,684
Marion Houle.

486
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:02,347
Charlotte Masson.

487
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:04,152
Laurie Thibodeau.

488
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:05,283
Yes.

489
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:37,014
Yes, Bruno Hamel.
Check the names, you'll see.

490
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:42,420
Police!

491
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:53,106
Nobody here.

492
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:15,561
A remote-controlled computer?
What do you mean?

493
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:17,256
Where's he calling from?

494
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:18,560
We're identifying his lSP.

495
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:21,727
We'll call them.
It shouldn't take long.

496
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:34,043
Yes.

497
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:36,174
It's up north in Charette.

498
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:38,343
He subscribed
using a fake name.

499
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:41,320
Get the local guys in there.

500
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:57,771
We're at the address.

501
01:17:57,873 --> 01:18:02,071
There's a laptop
and a cell phone, but no Hamel.

502
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:03,940
He's hiding somewhere else.

503
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:35,642
Hello.

504
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:14,109
With the gas?

505
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:20,186
$46.19.

506
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:35,826
I know who you are.

507
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:45,905
I'm with you.

508
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:55,414
Thanks.

509
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:17,433
You've been looking
near Charette.

510
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:20,372
Because that's
where he's hiding.

511
01:21:20,475 --> 01:21:23,239
He called from there,
but he may not be there.

512
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:24,370
"DAY SlX"

513
01:21:24,412 --> 01:21:25,811
He has to be.

514
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:29,281
He called his wife 15 minutes
after seeing her on TV.

515
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,215
In 15 minutes on a dirt road,

516
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:34,686
you can't drive
more than 25 kilometers.

517
01:21:34,789 --> 01:21:36,017
Okay.

518
01:21:36,124 --> 01:21:38,718
But it's still a huge area.

519
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:42,319
There are tons of cottages.

520
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:45,058
We'll put all our men on it.

521
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:48,226
We traced all Hamel's calls
to the Charette place.

522
01:21:48,336 --> 01:21:51,066
He called TVA TV
just before we got there.

523
01:21:51,172 --> 01:21:52,662
Who did he speak to?

524
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:57,404
We never thought they'd find
our little Laurie's killer.

525
01:21:57,512 --> 01:22:01,881
Knowing that Bruno Hamel
has him prisoner,

526
01:22:01,983 --> 01:22:04,713
we not only approve,
we urge him on.

527
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:11,122
I want you to make him suffer,
Dr. Hamel.

528
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:15,925
Make him suffer as much
as he made my Marion suffer.

529
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:17,896
One person disagrees,

530
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:20,832
the third victim's mother,
Mrs. Diane Masson,

531
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:24,303
a widow who raised her Charlotte
alone in St. Hyacinthe

532
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:27,603
until Anthony Lemaire
ruined her life.

533
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:31,702
I think what Dr. Hamel is doing
is pointless.

534
01:22:31,813 --> 01:22:35,180
It won't help him, or me,
or anyone.

535
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:38,150
For me,
that man doesn't exist.

536
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:40,983
That horrible event happened
four years ago.

537
01:22:41,089 --> 01:22:43,455
I went on with my life.

538
01:22:43,558 --> 01:22:46,186
I'm all alone,
but I'm alive all the same.

539
01:22:55,737 --> 01:22:58,297
St. Hyacinthe.

540
01:22:58,406 --> 01:23:01,375
Yes.

541
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:03,273
Diane Masson.

542
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:26,752
What you said on TV
is disgusting.

543
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:38,896
Why did you bring me here?

544
01:25:45,406 --> 01:25:47,806
For you,
that man doesn't exist?

545
01:25:50,378 --> 01:25:52,243
We'll see about that.

546
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:57,411
I don't want to see him!

547
01:25:57,519 --> 01:25:59,111
I don't want to.

548
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:03,748
I don't want to!

549
01:26:03,858 --> 01:26:07,089
Let me go!
Let me go.

550
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:10,494
I said let me go!

551
01:26:10,598 --> 01:26:12,623
You bastard!

552
01:26:12,734 --> 01:26:13,996
I don't want to go!

553
01:26:14,102 --> 01:26:16,468
I don't want to see him!

554
01:26:24,812 --> 01:26:26,643
Look at him.

555
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:28,477
Look at him!

556
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:31,780
That man doesn't exist?
He doesn't exist?

557
01:26:39,327 --> 01:26:42,023
Look at him.

558
01:26:51,506 --> 01:26:53,599
He doesn't exist?

559
01:26:57,312 --> 01:26:58,745
Go on.

560
01:26:58,846 --> 01:27:00,370
Go ahead.

561
01:27:00,481 --> 01:27:03,609
I know you want to.
Finish him off.

562
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:06,186
Come on.

563
01:27:06,287 --> 01:27:09,279
Now's the time.
Do it, finish him off!

564
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:11,790
- Kill him.
- I won't.

565
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:14,225
- Kill the bastard.
- I won't.

566
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:16,229
- Kill the fucker!
- No!

567
01:27:16,331 --> 01:27:19,095
Finish him off!

568
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:41,010
I'll give you time
to realize he exists.

569
01:27:41,122 --> 01:27:43,113
Let me out!
Let me out!

570
01:27:43,224 --> 01:27:45,749
Let me out!
I won't do it, I told you!

571
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:46,849
Please.

572
01:27:46,961 --> 01:27:50,829
Please, let me out!

573
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:55,232
Let me out, please.

574
01:27:55,336 --> 01:27:57,736
Please, let me out.

575
01:27:57,839 --> 01:27:58,863
Please.

576
01:27:58,973 --> 01:28:00,531
Let me go.

577
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:51,187
I'd erased that man
from my life.

578
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:55,661
- You can't.
- Yes, you can.

579
01:28:55,763 --> 01:29:00,564
It's hard, it takes long,
but you can.

580
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:10,409
By bringing me here,
you destroyed that.

581
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:13,275
It's like...

582
01:29:19,787 --> 01:29:23,621
It's like you killed my girl
a second time.

583
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:29,494
Every time
you torture that man,

584
01:29:29,597 --> 01:29:31,292
you kill your own daughter.

585
01:34:03,904 --> 01:34:05,804
Take me to the police.

586
01:34:05,906 --> 01:34:11,071
Concentrate on waterfront houses
by a lake or river.

587
01:34:11,178 --> 01:34:12,907
Forget rental cottages.

588
01:34:13,014 --> 01:34:17,007
Masson's convinced Hamel
broke into a private home.

589
01:34:17,118 --> 01:34:19,712
He's using Masson's car,
a red Saturn.

590
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:21,788
We have the license plate.

591
01:34:28,729 --> 01:34:32,756
"DAY SEVEN"

592
01:35:21,182 --> 01:35:22,843
I'll go there.

593
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:24,008
It's an hour away.

594
01:35:24,118 --> 01:35:25,813
I want to be in Charette
when they find him.

595
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,616
Keep me posted.

596
01:36:25,112 --> 01:36:27,910
Call Mercure.
We found him.

597
01:41:51,138 --> 01:41:52,298
Dr. Mercure?

598
01:41:52,406 --> 01:41:53,668
Sergeant Coutu.

599
01:41:53,774 --> 01:41:56,174
We just called the SWAT team.

600
01:41:56,276 --> 01:41:58,107
We'll move in now.

601
01:41:58,212 --> 01:41:59,543
Yeah.

602
01:41:59,646 --> 01:42:03,446
- I don't want...
- He won't just wait for us.

603
01:42:03,550 --> 01:42:05,279
There's been no movement?

604
01:42:05,385 --> 01:42:10,846
Nothing.
Maybe he's still asleep.

605
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:13,483
Call an ambulance.
Tell them no siren.

606
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:18,329
Is this Hamel's hideout?

607
01:42:18,432 --> 01:42:20,423
You found him?
Is Lemaire dead?

608
01:42:20,534 --> 01:42:23,731
No comment yet.
Please step back.

609
01:42:23,837 --> 01:42:25,566
Keep those guys far away.

610
01:42:25,672 --> 01:42:27,970
And make sure they keep
their mouths shut.

611
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:31,971
Here we go.

612
01:42:36,783 --> 01:42:38,273
Is he trapped?

613
01:42:38,385 --> 01:42:39,943
He's trapped.

614
01:42:54,701 --> 01:42:57,226
It's her birthday today.

615
01:43:00,474 --> 01:43:02,942
She would have been 9.

616
01:44:52,486 --> 01:44:54,613
Bruno Hamel?

617
01:44:54,721 --> 01:44:57,519
This is Detective Sergeant
Hervי Mercure.

618
01:44:57,624 --> 01:45:00,024
You're surrounded.

619
01:45:00,127 --> 01:45:02,823
Come out with your hands up.

620
01:45:11,605 --> 01:45:13,903
Bruno Hamel!

621
01:45:14,007 --> 01:45:15,634
Come out with your hands up.

622
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:56,110
Drop your gun.

623
01:46:18,271 --> 01:46:19,932
Dr. Bruno Hamel,

624
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:24,602
you are under arrest for
kidnapping and attempted murder.

625
01:46:24,711 --> 01:46:27,509
You have a right
to immediate legal counsel.

626
01:46:27,614 --> 01:46:30,708
Do you understand?
Do you understand?

627
01:46:30,817 --> 01:46:32,182
You have the right
to remain silent.

628
01:46:32,285 --> 01:46:36,016
Anything you say
can be used against you.

629
01:46:44,731 --> 01:46:47,359
I didn't kill him.

630
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:51,829
Dr. Hamel?

631
01:46:51,938 --> 01:46:55,499
Do you still think vengeance
is the right answer?

632
01:46:55,609 --> 01:46:57,076
No.

633
01:46:57,177 --> 01:47:00,772
So you regret
what you've done?

634
01:47:00,881 --> 01:47:02,712
No.
