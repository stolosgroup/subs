2
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,769
I can't believe this.

3
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,597
Why not?

4
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:18,265
Because I love you,
Fabio, like a son.

5
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:21,935
I love you, Don Luis,
like a father.

6
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,542
I'm going to miss you.

7
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,317
And I'm going to miss you.

8
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:34,186
Okay. Enough of this
sentimental bullshit.

9
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,850
One last drink?
Next we'll be crying

10
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:39,554
like two old women.
Come on!

11
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:42,998
To the future.

12
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,579
So business is all clear?

13
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,480
It's all here.

14
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,551
No other copies?
You have to ask?

15
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:07,885
Hey, hey, hey.

16
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,050
Oh, come on, eh?

17
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,769
I'm going to miss you.

18
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:20,596
Adiףs, Marco.

19
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,874
Kill this motherfucker.

20
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,954
Not okay, boss?

21
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,691
The bastard thinks I'm an idiot,
playing it mellow.

22
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:52,860
If he screamed and threatened
to kill my family,

23
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,528
it would've been better!

24
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,106
We have an hour
to get out of here at the most.

25
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,336
We've got 10 minutes.

26
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,511
Cataleya, go pack.
I'm packed, Mama.

27
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,688
Cataleya.

28
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,634
In case anything happens,

29
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,430
this-- This is your passport.

30
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,102
You find yourself alone,

31
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,300
you go to the address
on this card,

32
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,344
you show it to the man
at the gate.

33
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,442
I don't understand, Papa.

34
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,515
Cata, you don't
have to understand.

35
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:17,018
You just have to listen
and remember.

36
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,815
Now...

37
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,794
And this,
this will keep you safe.

38
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,132
The Cattleya orchid.

39
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:39,038
My mother, your grandmother,
used to grow them.

40
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,476
Every morning,
I'd wake up to the sight of them,

41
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,546
the smell of them.

42
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:49,145
That's why
I named you Cataleya.

43
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,880
Never forget
where you came from.

44
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,604
We want to see Don Fabio.

45
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,933
He is not home.

46
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,005
I'm ready.

47
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:30,623
Back! Back! Back!

48
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,799
He said he's not home yet.

49
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,528
Wait a minute.

50
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,730
It's too late.
Get ready.

51
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,302
Go. Go.

52
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:55,815
I love you very much.

53
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,920
I love you too, Papa.

54
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,453
Do it now.
Okay.

55
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,654
Change of plans.

56
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,147
Cata.

57
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,626
Alicia!

58
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,362
Fabio...

59
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:26,227
...you should know
that you don't leave Don Luis.

60
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,897
Only die.

61
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,778
Hey, what are you doing?
Don Luis said kill everyone.

62
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:50,121
He also said no names.
She won't remember.

63
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,229
She's a kid.
So what?

64
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:01,235
What do you mean, "So what?" Hm?

65
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,737
What do you mean?

66
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,614
Do you remember me, Cataleya?

67
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,251
I was at your
confirmation.

68
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:22,587
My name is Marco, and I was a
very good friend of your father.

69
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:27,325
You know who Don Luis is, right?

70
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:31,200
He was like a father
to your father.

71
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,103
That makes you family too.

72
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:40,771
But when someone

73
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,607
is good to you

74
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:47,979
and you're not good to them back,
then bad things happen.

75
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,279
You do very well in school.

76
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,857
So I know this is not too
complicated for you. Am I right?

77
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,895
Excellent. Now, your father

78
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,397
had something
that belonged to Don Luis.

79
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,968
IFS a small thing,
not bigger than this.

80
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,465
Do you know where it is?

81
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,901
Well, if you give it to me,

82
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:18,674
Don Luis will be very happy
and very grateful.

83
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:23,985
So why don't you just
give me that little thing

84
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,145
which belongs to him?

85
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,486
Would you do that?

86
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,584
You're a smart girl,

87
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,357
and in this life,
smart girls

88
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,434
always get
what they want. Hm?

89
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:40,769
So just tell me.

90
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,736
Just tell me, sweetheart.

91
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,831
What do you want?

92
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,077
Aah!
To kill Don Luis.

93
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,718
Get that little bitch!

94
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,365
We need her alive!

95
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,279
Find her! Find the little bitch!

96
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:17,593
Eh?

97
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:17,016
Alive.

98
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,235
Got you.

99
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,571
Quick!

100
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,440
Get her! Go! Quick!

101
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:48,914
Shit!

102
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,132
Excuse me.

103
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,319
And you say you have
something for us, sweetie?

104
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:01,984
Well, may I see it?

105
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,696
Jesus.

106
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,183
Um...

107
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,536
Everybody,
take a Eve-minute coffee break.

108
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,868
Jim, we're going to
have to record this.

109
00:18:57,036 --> 00:19:00,210
Where did you get this, sweetie?
My papa.

110
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:01,817
And where is your papa?

111
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:03,876
Dead.

112
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,881
Do you know what this is?

113
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,885
Yes.

114
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:11,551
My passport.

115
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:20,593
We're about to arrive
in Miami.

116
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,773
Let me buckle you up.

117
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,282
Welcome to America.

118
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,830
Go ahead. I'll wait right here.

119
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,055
Cataleya?

120
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,795
Hello, young lady.
Where are we wanting to go today?

121
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,402
Chicago. It's not just
down the street, you know.

122
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:34,906
How much?

123
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,295
Hey, kid.

124
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,868
What are you doing here?

125
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,718
Emilio.

126
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,592
Emilio.

127
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,631
Emilio.

128
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,930
There's a girl
looking for you.

129
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,946
Her name is Cataleya.

130
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,667
Cataleya.

131
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,309
I thought you were dead.

132
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,548
You're safe.

133
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,719
It's okay. You're safe now.

134
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:38,656
You're safe.

135
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:07,121
--Still locked in a
bitter battle over the budget.

136
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,205
You have

137
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:26,867
your mothers beautiful eyes.

138
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,272
Don't be afraid.

139
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,246
This is your home.

140
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,114
How long has it been
since you sleep?

141
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:45,388
I don't know. A long time ago.

142
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:49,157
Wen, good.
A young body needs to sleep.

143
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:53,497
When I was your age,
I would sleep half the day.

144
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,003
I don't know if it helped
with the growing,

145
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,732
but I was always ready
for what came after.

146
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,781
Whose room did I sleep in?

147
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:08,908
My son.

148
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:11,178
Your cousin.

149
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:14,519
Where is he?

150
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,785
He's dead.

151
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,958
Killed?

152
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,430
Yes.

153
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,629
By who?

154
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:33,472
No one who is still alive.

155
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:39,282
You are very talented.

156
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:41,679
Is this what you want to be,
an artist?

157
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,446
I used to want to be like Xena.

158
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,186
Warrior princess.

159
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,519
Not anymore?

160
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,187
Now?

161
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,631
I wan (to be a killer.

162
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,537
Can you help?

163
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,638
Sure.

164
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:29,659
Normally, we don't accept students
in the middle of the academic year.

165
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:32,828
But under these circumstances,

166
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:36,996
losing her parents
in this tragic car accident...

167
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:40,775
Here you are.
These are the school supplies

168
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,275
you will need.
- Sorry.

169
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,905
She's a little traumatized.

170
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,880
Of course.
We'll see you Monday, Cataleya.

171
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:50,751
Such a pretty name.

172
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:03,931
After we get this stuff, we'll go
to Maxwell Street to get a hot dog

173
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,433
from the Polish people.
You like hot dogs?

174
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,794
Hey.

175
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,440
What is it now?

176
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,774
That school has nothing
to teach me.

177
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,914
I told you what I want.

178
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:22,480
You don't want
to help me? Fine.

179
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,143
I'll do it myself.

180
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,053
Look.

181
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,228
Stop! Run!

182
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:44,134
Like that?
That's what you want?

183
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:46,572
You want me to teach you
how to be a killer?

184
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:48,335
No problem. I teach you.

185
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,003
But you'll be dead in five years.

186
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:58,610
If you want to be a killer and survive,
you got to be a smart one.

187
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:02,350
Have to know things
besides how to pull a trigger.

188
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,494
You have to know how people think.

189
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,788
You got to learn how
to be psychological.

190
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:10,456
I cannot teach you that unless
you learn the basics at a school.

191
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,602
You got that? Hm?

192
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:16,201
Come on, what's it going to be?
Cataleya, you choose.

193
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:17,696
Come on.

194
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,705
Now. Choose. Come on.

195
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,813
What you want? Choose.

196
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,153
Bette F.

197
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:02,007
Hey, buddy.

198
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:05,511
I got the good stuff.
So then I suggest,

199
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:09,147
you know, let's buy some
things, spice it up a bit.

200
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:12,693
A garter belt, some of those
stockings that come up to the thigh.

201
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,728
Right, nice.
It's been 14 years.

202
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:17,560
You know?
No matter how much I like steak,

203
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:20,362
sometimes a lamb chop
isn't a bad thing, right?

204
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:22,004
Exactly.

205
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:24,563
Oh, my God.

206
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,677
Son of a bitch!

207
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,185
Fuck, man.

208
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,917
What the--?

209
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:41,547
Put your hands
on the car!

210
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:44,557
Hands on the vehicle
right now. Right now.

211
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,454
Oh, bad--

212
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:54,137
You stupid crazy bitch.
I'm really sorry. This is not--

213
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,272
it's not even my car.
- This is funny?

214
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:57,532
No, sir!

215
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,370
I'll give you something
to laugh about.

216
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,540
I'm sor-- Officer, I'm sorry.
I don't drink.

217
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,424
What the--?

218
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:30,099
Oh, hey.
There's nothing here.

219
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:36,578
No license, no registration,
no ID.

220
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:39,477
Except for a library card.

221
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:43,976
Miss Valerie Phillips.

222
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:48,488
In addition to all that,
you are being charged with DUI,

223
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:50,786
driving the wrong side
of the road,

224
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,429
and destruction
of police property.

225
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:56,496
Miss Phillips!

226
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,029
Do I have your full attention?

227
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,603
Yeah.

228
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,367
That's it?

229
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,534
Unless there's anything
else you can think of.

230
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:11,670
I have to throw up.

231
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:14,373
Oh, no, no, no.
Get her out of here!

232
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:17,811
And a cup of coffee.
We'll book her tomorrow.

233
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:20,456
Let her sleep it off,
for chrissakes.

234
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,797
All right, big step.
Down you come.

235
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,369
All right, stretch those legs.
Come on, move.

236
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,509
Regis, check downstairs.

237
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:43,077
She's from Roma.
And she says to the other--

238
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,975
Excuse me.
U.S. Marshal Warren.

239
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,913
I'm here with Gennaro Rizzo
on an overnight.

240
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,576
Wait, hold a second.
You know, it says here

241
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:54,815
you're not expected until tomorrow.
Never expect the expected, sergeant.

242
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:57,550
Is that coffee there? Is that fresh?
Yes, it is.

243
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:59,696
Do you mind?
Patrick.

244
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,922
Appreciate it.
Officer Doyle

245
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,033
is gonna show you
the Cell blocks.

246
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:05,725
Oh, come on.

247
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,163
Home, sweet home.

248
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,437
After you, sir.

249
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,885
I'm gonna miss you, Rizzo.

250
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,352
I'll leave that there.

251
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,924
Just in case you get hungry
in the night.

252
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,127
Sleep well.

253
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,561
Be a caffeine kind of night, Joe.
Keep your eyes open.

254
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,762
--The count two balls and no strikes.

255
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:46,869
He does have
24 home runs and...

256
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,559
Two.

257
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:18,785
One.

258
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,089
Oh, f--

259
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,734
Not again.

260
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,803
Hey, Doyle, go check the
ventilation system, will you?

261
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,134
As in today, please.
Jesus Christ.

262
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,550
Oh, Shit.

263
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:31,633
Yeah?
Yeah, I gotta pee.

264
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:41,197
Unbutton your shirt.
What?

265
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,770
Now.

266
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,373
Who are you?

267
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:50,043
Not room service.

268
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:59,016
Go!
Come on!

269
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:00,588
High-level security threat.

270
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:03,924
- Come on!
- Move! Move!

271
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:08,520
Come on, move! Get inside!
Somebody open the door!

272
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:18,367
Look at me. Look at me.
Give me the gun.

273
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,942
Just give it to me, okay?
It's okay. That's good.

274
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,772
Move it! Hold him down!
I didn't do it!

275
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,216
You really gotta listen to me.

276
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:29,942
- You got him?
- Watch him!

277
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:31,644
- Get him Out.
- I didn't do it!

278
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,050
Get him out! Call it in.
I didn't do it!

279
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:36,081
Call it in!

280
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,225
Come on!

281
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:41,897
Step aside!
- Go, go!

282
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,242
Come on, spread out, men.

283
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,446
There!

284
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,964
Check out the north side.

285
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:56,298
It's clear here.

286
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:23,161
Okay, okay, let's go.

287
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:42,742
Agent Ross.

288
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:44,352
Where is he?

289
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:47,546
He's in the morgue.
Let's go.

290
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:56,364
This is just how he came in.

291
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:01,260
It's the same handwriting.

292
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,764
Same drawing, right?

293
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,706
It's him.

294
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,403
I want to see the location,
please.

295
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,582
Thank you.

296
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,778
- Oh, I shouldn't drink.
- No, you shouldn't.

297
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:23,391
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, you can tell that to the judge

298
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:27,256
in 10 days' time at your hearing.
Oh, my God.

299
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,133
What's going on down there?
Nothing. Sign this form.

300
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,394
And then you can go.

301
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,434
Really?
But I'm sure the judge

302
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:38,233
will send you back here.
I probably deserve it.

303
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:40,808
Yeah, well, you're just lucky
no one got hurt.

304
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,914
Marshal. Marshal!

305
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:48,744
Okay, okay, back up.

306
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,977
Was it an assassination?

307
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,255
You didn't lock it down.

308
00:41:58,416 --> 00:41:59,588
It was after the fact.

309
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,923
I didn't think anybody--
You have to do it.

310
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:05,158
Nobody in, nobody out, please.
Okay.

311
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:08,361
You heard the man, lock it down.
Nobody in, nobody out.

312
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,164
When will there be a statement?

313
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:14,004
Will the commissioner hold
a press conference again?

314
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:15,769
Yes or no?

315
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:21,280
People need to know!

316
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:47,637
I want to see paper on everybody
in and out of this station

317
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,641
in the last 24 hours.

318
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:57,817
And I want the tapes
from all the security cameras.

319
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:59,352
All of them.

320
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:49,200
We're good.
When you are back?

321
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,237
The day after tomorrow.
Good.

322
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:53,602
I have something for you.

323
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:55,869
Give me a day.
Okay.

324
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:58,206
We can't wait to see you back.

325
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:02,047
Give Mama a kiss for me.
I will.

326
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:07,416
Thank you.

327
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:11,548
Twenty-two murders in the last
four years, all with the same MO.

328
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,786
Rm right.
He is sending a message,

329
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,227
but I believe
it's not meant for us.

330
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:18,230
We're the ones
with the information.

331
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:21,927
We're not getting anywhere with it.
Put it out to the press.

332
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:26,632
Its time. The word.
This lipstick drawing.

333
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:29,573
I want it splashed over
every newspaper, magazine.

334
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:32,805
Front page, national.
If the message isn't meant for us,

335
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,814
let's make sure it gets
to who it's intended for.

336
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:53,261
Mr. Richard.
Hm. Marco.

337
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:56,098
It's been a long time.
It has. How is the hand?

338
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,436
It only hurts when it's humid.

339
00:44:59,597 --> 00:45:02,635
Let us relocate you to Arizona
instead of New Orleans.

340
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,440
Yeah, right.
But the boss likes it humid.

341
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:08,106
He's waiting for you.
Okay.

342
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:14,122
What do you think? Hm?

343
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:16,656
Coincidence.
Twenty-two times?

344
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:19,352
Flower that only grows
in one place on earth.

345
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,796
Uh, didn't that used to be
the calling card of...?

346
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:25,126
Shoot. I forgot his name.

347
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:27,132
What was his name?
Your partner?

348
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,794
You know, the one who
used to do your wet work.

349
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:32,799
Fabio.
Fabio.

350
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:34,840
Fabio Mafia Restrepo.

351
00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:36,501
May I?

352
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:41,915
The CIA is not
an amusement park.

353
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:45,144
When the agency extracted you
from Colombia 15 years ago,

354
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:49,155
and set you up here, we allowed you
to resume your little business.

355
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:51,987
What we should've done
was lock you away for life.

356
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:55,426
Now, in exchange, you should've
kept the information flowing.

357
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,088
And I have.
Not much.

358
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:03,369
I had nothing to do with this.
Then find out who did.

359
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:19,878
She's talking to us.

360
00:46:20,678 --> 00:46:22,555
Could be anyone.

361
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:24,192
Idiot.

362
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:28,763
I told you, everyone dead,
down to the dog.

363
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:32,427
You screwed up the first time.

364
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:35,696
Now, go fix it.

365
00:47:27,745 --> 00:47:29,088
? Deeper down?

366
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:34,155
? We're all goin' down?

367
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:40,124
? Down, deeper down, yeah?

368
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:47,336
? We are all plunging
Straight towards our own decline?

369
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:51,469
? Without noticing
We slide down, deeper down?

370
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:52,875
? Down?

371
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:57,711
? Down, deeper down, yeah?

372
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:32,743
Each and every one of the victims
was a professional bad apple.

373
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,550
As for motive,
I've narrowed it down to

374
00:48:35,713 --> 00:48:38,922
payback, but not much else.
My best guess:

375
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,562
Alexa Milshinova.

376
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:43,692
She made a career
out of getting intimate

377
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:46,494
with high-stakes gamblers
out of Vegas.

378
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:50,002
She would rip them off and then
send them to meet their maker.

379
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,834
Here, DiAngelo James.

380
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:56,876
He tried to take over
the heroin trade from Houston

381
00:48:57,835 --> 00:49:00,008
from the Gemini cartel.

382
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:03,549
If you do not know all there is
to know about these twins,

383
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,550
you should not be in this room.

384
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:11,356
You see, he tilts
the camera just enough

385
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:16,021
so he won't be seen going into
the cell. The time, 1:55 a.m.

386
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:19,429
That means our perp
was in that station that...

387
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,034
I don't have to spell it out
for you, do I?

388
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:24,129
Excuse me.

389
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,240
Hand these out, please.

390
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:29,703
These are names, addresses
and phone numbers

391
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:35,545
of everyone with a pulse who was
in that station before 1:55 a.m.

392
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:39,779
Everyone. Which means
one of them was our target.

393
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:43,447
Locate the 10 people in the folder
you've just been handed.

394
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:45,616
I want a detailed dossier on each

395
00:49:45,783 --> 00:49:48,059
for the last 10 years of their lives.

396
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:51,893
I want you to run down every lead.
You will check every story.

397
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:54,899
Our killer, ladies and gentlemen,
is in those folders.

398
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:58,437
And I mean to catch him
before he kills again.

399
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,132
Don't move.

400
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:35,772
Hello, Jennifer.

401
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:38,370
Hello, Danny.

402
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:49,450
? Get so tired?

403
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:51,490
You haven't finished
your painting.

404
00:50:52,316 --> 00:50:55,388
You never finish a painting.
You just stop working on it.

405
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,031
I know something you finish.

406
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:59,360
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

407
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:06,035
? A thousand flowers?

408
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:08,233
Tell me something.

409
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:13,146
Will we ever go on a normal date?
What's a normal date?

410
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:16,841
You know, go out, have dinner,
drink wine, get drunk.

411
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:18,645
Mmm. Dessert?

412
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:24,491
? Give me a reason
To love you?

413
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:32,665
? Give me a reason
To want to be your man?

414
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:40,368
? Give me the reason to love you?

415
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,726
? Watch out, watch out?

416
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:35,225
? Timber?

417
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,056
Safe?

418
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:41,895
From my end. You?

419
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:43,561
Safe.

420
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,229
How's Mama?

421
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:48,740
She is missing you.

422
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:50,401
Tell her I miss her back.

423
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:53,411
I think she would love
to hear that from you.

424
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:54,981
I know.

425
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:57,247
What do we have?

426
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:03,156
Remember the guy on the news
running a Ponzi scheme

427
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:04,690
about a year ago?
Mm-hm.

428
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,590
Made $50 million
and vanished into thin air.

429
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:10,129
Clever guy. Now he's
living in the Caribbean.

430
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:11,595
Oh.
Mm.

431
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:14,998
So left a lot of people very upset.

432
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:18,605
So we give him a break.
Permanently.

433
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:21,640
Okay.

434
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:25,807
There's something else.

435
00:53:31,008 --> 00:53:33,784
How long has this
been going on?

436
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:42,957
Not long.
Newspaper says 22.

437
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,964
Why?
You know why.

438
00:53:46,123 --> 00:53:47,830
Think this will
smoke Don Luis out?

439
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:52,201
You think he's that stupid?
It's not just about you, okay, Cataleya?

440
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:54,399
There's me, Mama, the family.

441
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,880
Tio, please. You're clean.

442
00:54:01,038 --> 00:54:03,314
You book the work,
you collect the money.

443
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:06,818
Oh. How nice. And I watch your back.
That's what I do.

444
00:54:06,995 --> 00:54:09,098
Each and every job,
I vet, I double-vet.

445
00:54:09,264 --> 00:54:11,676
If I give you a job,
I turn down five, 10,

446
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:15,440
because I made a promise
to keep you safe.

447
00:54:15,604 --> 00:54:18,949
I keep you safe, Cataleya.
That is a full-time job,

448
00:54:19,107 --> 00:54:21,109
no matter what
you think. But this?

449
00:54:21,276 --> 00:54:22,778
It's not professional.

450
00:54:22,944 --> 00:54:26,551
I don't care about what's professional.
I'm doing this my way.

451
00:54:26,715 --> 00:54:28,888
That is your way?
Yeah.

452
00:54:29,051 --> 00:54:31,622
A Tag Killer?

453
00:54:41,163 --> 00:54:44,201
L should never have
let you do this.

454
00:54:44,366 --> 00:54:47,813
Never.
You didn't let me do anything.

455
00:54:47,969 --> 00:54:52,475
I chose this, remember?
I chose this.

456
00:54:52,641 --> 00:54:54,746
From the moment
I walked in your door,

457
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:57,481
I had already made my decision.
By yourself?

458
00:54:57,646 --> 00:54:59,250
Yes.

459
00:55:00,482 --> 00:55:03,827
Not you or anybody
is going to change that.

460
00:55:07,489 --> 00:55:09,992
We love you, Cataleya.

461
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:18,034
Then watch my back
until it's done.

462
00:55:31,379 --> 00:55:33,017
Cattleya.

463
00:55:33,181 --> 00:55:34,421
Excuse me?

464
00:55:34,583 --> 00:55:37,530
It's an orchid.
What? This is?

465
00:55:37,686 --> 00:55:41,099
Sure it is. It grows in Colombia.
How do you know that?

466
00:55:41,256 --> 00:55:42,860
My wife, she's Colombian.

467
00:55:44,259 --> 00:55:46,068
Colombia. Uh...

468
00:55:46,228 --> 00:55:47,935
Cattleya?
That's right.

469
00:56:01,042 --> 00:56:04,455
Okay. Let's try "organization"

470
00:56:06,148 --> 00:56:08,253
Well, shit.

471
00:56:15,824 --> 00:56:17,826
Hi, boys. Did you miss me?

472
00:56:19,227 --> 00:56:21,002
Yeah? Well, I missed you too.

473
00:56:23,165 --> 00:56:25,338
Hi. Come.

474
00:56:27,335 --> 00:56:29,315
You guys been good? Hm?

475
00:56:29,471 --> 00:56:30,916
All right, stay.

476
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,483
Sirloin.

477
00:56:33,642 --> 00:56:36,248
Juicy. Delicious.

478
00:56:37,579 --> 00:56:39,422
Want one? Good.

479
00:56:47,155 --> 00:56:49,032
Eat.

480
00:56:57,666 --> 00:56:58,701
I know that song.

481
00:57:02,204 --> 00:57:04,013
I guess the boys
gave me away, huh?

482
00:57:04,172 --> 00:57:05,947
You spoil them.
I train them.

483
00:57:15,617 --> 00:57:17,392
? If you're on the court alone?
? Hoop dreams?

484
00:57:17,552 --> 00:57:19,657
? Try to give it all you got?
? Hoop dreams?

485
00:57:19,821 --> 00:57:21,801
? Yo, it's 10:00 in the park
Gettin' dark?

486
00:57:21,957 --> 00:57:24,631
? But you still gotta hit this fast shot?
? Hoop dreams?

487
00:57:24,793 --> 00:57:27,239
J' Yo, I got this hoop dream
Written all on my mind J'

488
00:57:27,395 --> 00:57:29,534
? I'm 'bout to push rocks
Orange with the black lines?

489
00:57:29,698 --> 00:57:32,235
? Y'all know the deal
I got dreams of dunks?

490
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,640
Fishy, fishy.

491
00:57:33,802 --> 00:57:35,042
Willie!

492
00:57:35,203 --> 00:57:36,739
Why are they ignoring me?

493
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:40,312
What?
- Baby,

494
00:57:40,475 --> 00:57:42,887
you put one drop of blood
in there,

495
00:57:43,044 --> 00:57:45,820
they'll be your biggest admirers.
Really?

496
00:57:45,981 --> 00:57:47,221
Oh, yeah, baby.

497
00:57:47,382 --> 00:57:50,488
All the way down to your clean,
stripped bones.

498
00:57:51,386 --> 00:57:53,730
Cool.

499
00:57:58,493 --> 00:58:01,667
Alejandro, you bring in
extra security for tonight.

500
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:03,275
Yes, sir.
You make sure

501
00:58:03,431 --> 00:58:05,911
that we are shut down, tight.

502
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:08,240
Yes, sir.
Take care.

503
00:58:11,907 --> 00:58:14,911
Girls! Come to papa, huh?

504
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:30,861
There are guys in the garden
and guys out back.

505
00:58:31,026 --> 00:58:33,267
I want you three upstairs.
- Yes, sir.

506
00:58:33,428 --> 00:58:35,465
Two on the roof.

507
00:58:37,198 --> 00:58:38,370
Hurry!

508
01:00:24,139 --> 01:00:25,516
What's this?

509
01:00:36,885 --> 01:00:38,762
Willie, come back to bed.

510
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,365
Shh.

511
01:01:20,695 --> 01:01:22,265
What the fuck is it?

512
01:01:43,618 --> 01:01:45,154
Turn around.

513
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:58,071
Who are you?
It doesn't matter who I am.

514
01:02:04,339 --> 01:02:06,080
Okay, what do you want?

515
01:02:06,241 --> 01:02:08,016
I want you exactly where you are.

516
01:02:14,582 --> 01:02:17,188
Whatever they're paying,
I'll double ii.

517
01:02:17,352 --> 01:02:20,595
Please, please don't kill me.
I'm not gonna kill you.

518
01:02:20,755 --> 01:02:21,756
Eh--? Wha--?

519
01:02:24,025 --> 01:02:25,333
Oh.

520
01:02:25,493 --> 01:02:26,870
Oh, no, no. Please.

521
01:02:32,767 --> 01:02:34,440
Oh, no!

522
01:02:57,125 --> 01:02:58,627
Yeah?
- Mn Steven Richard?

523
01:02:58,793 --> 01:02:59,897
Who is this?

524
01:03:00,061 --> 01:03:01,904
This is FBI Special Agent Ross.

525
01:03:02,063 --> 01:03:04,839
Look, I'm lead agent on a case.
It's a serial

526
01:03:04,999 --> 01:03:07,878
we call the Tag Killer.
You might have heard of him.

527
01:03:08,036 --> 01:03:09,743
I've seen the publicity.

528
01:03:09,904 --> 01:03:12,851
He marks his victims with a flower.
It's from Colombia.

529
01:03:13,675 --> 01:03:16,918
The Cattleya orchid.
Each time I try to access information,

530
01:03:17,078 --> 01:03:20,059
I get stuck with a CIA
"access denied" tag.

531
01:03:20,215 --> 01:03:23,992
I'm at the end of a long road,
Mr. Richard. I've been led to believe

532
01:03:24,152 --> 01:03:27,156
that you are the man--
Listen, Agent Ross.

533
01:03:27,322 --> 01:03:29,996
I can’t give any information
out over the phone.

534
01:03:30,158 --> 01:03:33,002
I suggest you file a formal request
with the agency

535
01:03:33,161 --> 01:03:36,165
for any information you might want.
I'll be happy

536
01:03:36,331 --> 01:03:38,834
to get back to you
as soon as I can.

537
01:03:41,202 --> 01:03:42,840
Thank you.

538
01:03:53,281 --> 01:03:55,625
Hello.
Stop bullshitting me, Marco!

539
01:03:55,783 --> 01:03:57,956
I got the FBI on my ass now.

540
01:03:58,119 --> 01:04:00,065
I want that problem taken care of

541
01:04:00,221 --> 01:04:02,861
Do you hear me?
Loud and clear.

542
01:04:03,024 --> 01:04:04,230
Good.

543
01:04:04,392 --> 01:04:07,236
Keep your
baggage with you at all times.

544
01:04:10,798 --> 01:04:11,970
Where to?

545
01:04:12,133 --> 01:04:15,706
Downtown. And we question
every Colombian we meet

546
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:19,044
until we find an address
to get her family, okay?

547
01:04:44,565 --> 01:04:48,172
Jen, in case you show
up, I wanted to let you know

548
01:04:48,336 --> 01:04:52,478
that I went to New York to meet
with galleries. I'll be back tomorrow,

549
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,951
but if you're already here,
make yourself at home.

550
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:23,505
What do we got?

551
01:05:23,671 --> 01:05:27,050
We do have the surveillance
tapes from a few angles.

552
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:33,625
That's it?
That's it.

553
01:05:33,781 --> 01:05:35,624
It's not a lot to go on.
Come on.

554
01:05:35,783 --> 01:05:38,161
Run it through the database,
see what happens.

555
01:05:51,466 --> 01:05:55,175
We're not looking for a woman.
It's not possible.

556
01:06:13,154 --> 01:06:14,531
Wow.

557
01:06:15,523 --> 01:06:18,527
Wine?
Thank you.

558
01:06:21,262 --> 01:06:23,003
Come.
I'm impressed.

559
01:06:27,835 --> 01:06:29,280
I got you something.

560
01:06:29,437 --> 01:06:31,178
You did?
Yeah.

561
01:06:36,411 --> 01:06:37,947
A stuffed alligator?
Yeah.

562
01:06:38,112 --> 01:06:40,023
Exactly what
I've always wanted.

563
01:06:45,787 --> 01:06:48,631
Hey, Wait. Wait, wait.

564
01:06:50,391 --> 01:06:52,302
Let's just, uh...

565
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:55,703
Let's just sit, have this food
and talk for a bit first.

566
01:06:57,532 --> 01:06:59,205
What do you want to talk about?

567
01:07:00,701 --> 01:07:02,703
I don't know. Anything.

568
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:04,372
Ask me something.

569
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:08,380
How was your trip?

570
01:07:08,543 --> 01:07:10,887
It was great. The gallery
liked my paintings.

571
01:07:11,045 --> 01:07:13,389
They're gonna put up a show.
That's good.

572
01:07:13,548 --> 01:07:15,050
Right?
Yeah.

573
01:07:16,117 --> 01:07:17,255
My turn.

574
01:07:17,418 --> 01:07:19,398
How was your trip?

575
01:07:21,722 --> 01:07:24,566
Hot.
Did you do anything exciting?

576
01:07:24,725 --> 01:07:27,934
I went swimming.
Anything else?

577
01:07:31,165 --> 01:07:33,076
Come on, talk to me.

578
01:07:33,234 --> 01:07:35,180
What do you want to know?
Anything.

579
01:07:35,336 --> 01:07:37,338
Something about you.

580
01:07:37,505 --> 01:07:39,246
Something.

581
01:07:40,308 --> 01:07:42,413
Where are you from?

582
01:07:44,312 --> 01:07:46,622
Are your parents
from here in the city?

583
01:07:52,653 --> 01:07:55,657
Okay. Let's start with something
a little more simple.

584
01:07:55,823 --> 01:07:57,803
What do you like
to eat for breakfast?

585
01:07:57,959 --> 01:07:59,802
I don't eat breakfast.

586
01:08:01,162 --> 01:08:03,142
I'm not gonna hurt you.

587
01:08:03,297 --> 01:08:05,299
I want to know
a little bit about you.

588
01:08:05,466 --> 01:08:08,447
About what you feel, what you
feel about me. Anything.

589
01:08:08,603 --> 01:08:10,605
Just a little.

590
01:08:21,716 --> 01:08:24,196
I feel lonely sometimes.

591
01:08:26,287 --> 01:08:27,789
Thank you.

592
01:08:27,955 --> 01:08:29,525
Me too.

593
01:08:51,579 --> 01:08:53,490
Let me this time.

594
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:39,968
Morning.

595
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:45,240
You say you don't eat breakfast,
So I thought I'd make lunch.

596
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:48,642
Oh, my God. Oh, shit.
Wait. Where you going?

597
01:09:48,803 --> 01:09:51,306
I shouldn't have done this.
Done what?

598
01:09:51,472 --> 01:09:53,543
Any of it!
I don't understand. Why?

599
01:09:54,108 --> 01:09:56,384
What are you talking about? Why?
Because.

600
01:09:56,544 --> 01:09:59,218
Can you just hold on?
Can we just talk about this?

601
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:01,883
No, no, Danny.
We've talked too much.

602
01:10:02,049 --> 01:10:05,895
Jennifer, just stay for a minute.
I'm sorry, I have to go.

603
01:10:06,053 --> 01:10:07,760
Jennifer!

604
01:10:19,166 --> 01:10:20,975
I'm sorry I'm late.

605
01:10:26,307 --> 01:10:28,753
Eight people
slaughtered in Miami.

606
01:10:28,909 --> 01:10:30,411
One of them is my friend.

607
01:10:30,578 --> 01:10:31,579
So what?

608
01:10:31,746 --> 01:10:32,918
You know exactly what.

609
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,423
He's getting too close.

610
01:10:34,582 --> 01:10:36,289
Please, again with that?

611
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:40,193
They're looking for you,
so don't play with me.

612
01:10:41,756 --> 01:10:43,326
You're bringing them to you.

613
01:10:43,491 --> 01:10:46,301
I know how your twisted
little mind works.

614
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:50,306
Think this is a game?
I'm a fucking joke to you?

615
01:10:51,832 --> 01:10:53,140
Hm?

616
01:10:53,968 --> 01:10:56,642
You scare me, Cataleya.

617
01:10:56,804 --> 01:10:59,284
I don't want to deal
with your shit anymore.

618
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:02,785
I don't want to give you work
or anything anymore.

619
01:11:03,611 --> 01:11:05,682
YOU are retired.

620
01:11:05,946 --> 01:11:08,449
You can't do that.
Lunatic!

621
01:11:09,684 --> 01:11:12,221
How many people did you
kill when your boy died?

622
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:20,231
What you know about my son?

623
01:11:20,628 --> 01:11:23,472
You know fucking nothing
about my son.

624
01:11:26,233 --> 01:11:28,304
Bur it changed nothing.

625
01:11:29,503 --> 01:11:32,006
When I lose my son,
I lose my life.

626
01:11:32,173 --> 01:11:35,177
Everything that's important
to me is gone.

627
01:11:35,976 --> 01:11:38,422
But I want to believe
in you, Cataleya.

628
01:11:38,579 --> 01:11:43,494
Why? I still pray that you
find a life away from this,

629
01:11:43,651 --> 01:11:48,327
because no one in our entire family
has a chance for one.

630
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:57,506
Listen. Never come to the house,
never come to the church.

631
01:11:57,665 --> 01:11:59,008
Don't bother.

632
01:11:59,166 --> 01:12:01,703
I don't want to wait for
your phone call no more.

633
01:12:01,869 --> 01:12:04,941
I don't want you to break
my mother's heart.

634
01:12:05,106 --> 01:12:07,518
Maybe this

635
01:12:07,675 --> 01:12:11,851
will help you to understand
what I try to tell you.

636
01:12:40,441 --> 01:12:44,048
Five-six, brown eyes--
Well, hazel, actually.

637
01:12:44,912 --> 01:12:47,722
Dark hair, thick. Shiny.

638
01:12:47,882 --> 01:12:50,385
Incredible body, killer Smile.

639
01:12:50,551 --> 01:12:54,055
I think about her all day long.
Dude, you're in love.

640
01:12:55,389 --> 01:12:57,892
You're so smart.
Seriously, and I mean this

641
01:12:58,058 --> 01:13:00,732
from the bottom of my heart,
you're nuts.

642
01:13:00,895 --> 01:13:03,569
I haven't had anyone
in my life for 10 years.

643
01:13:03,731 --> 01:13:05,802
I finally meet someone
that I really like.

644
01:13:05,966 --> 01:13:08,242
That I want to be with
all the time.

645
01:13:08,402 --> 01:13:11,281
I've got nothing.
A stuffed animal and a picture.

646
01:13:12,339 --> 01:13:14,751
You got a picture? Give it up.

647
01:13:14,909 --> 01:13:16,582
It's not even a whole picture.

648
01:13:16,744 --> 01:13:18,849
I took it of her
while she was sleeping.

649
01:13:20,681 --> 01:13:22,092
Oh, my God!
Jesus, relax.

650
01:13:22,249 --> 01:13:24,251
When do I meet
the future Mrs. Delaney?

651
01:13:24,418 --> 01:13:25,761
You? Never.

652
01:13:27,188 --> 01:13:29,930
Oh, shit.
Ha, ha.

653
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:32,696
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Why are you writing a ticket?

654
01:13:41,035 --> 01:13:43,276
Third Precinct.
- Hey, Shari.

655
01:13:43,437 --> 01:13:44,609
You got that picture?

656
01:13:46,774 --> 01:13:49,653
Hello, skinny face
lying on my computer.

657
01:13:49,810 --> 01:13:52,620
Ooh. She's beautiful.
Clearly out of your league.

658
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:55,954
It's not for me, it's for Danny.
Remember the painter?

659
01:13:56,116 --> 01:13:58,289
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Much better match.

660
01:13:58,452 --> 01:13:59,988
How long's this gonna take?

661
01:14:00,154 --> 01:14:02,964
Slow your roll.
You're my brother-in-law, not my boss.

662
01:14:03,123 --> 01:14:06,468
I'm not supposed to do this.
Shari, you are gonna be

663
01:14:06,627 --> 01:14:10,006
the fairy godmother in the most
beautiful love story ever.

664
01:14:10,164 --> 01:14:11,802
Okay? Think about it.

665
01:14:11,966 --> 01:14:15,175
You get the honor of saying you
made this all happen.

666
01:14:15,336 --> 01:14:18,510
And I get to lose my job
if I get caught.

667
01:14:22,343 --> 01:14:24,323
Done. I'll call when
I got something.

668
01:14:24,979 --> 01:14:26,481
Thank you, baby.

669
01:14:34,088 --> 01:14:36,159
He'll thank me later.

670
01:14:47,067 --> 01:14:49,513
I want a trace put on
an incoming transmission.

671
01:15:05,519 --> 01:15:08,398
Chicago, Third Precinct.
Get somebody down there now.

672
01:15:53,133 --> 01:15:55,340
That was such a nice surprise.

673
01:15:56,904 --> 01:15:58,906
Everyone grows up sometime.

674
01:15:59,073 --> 01:16:00,245
She's gonna be okay.

675
01:16:02,176 --> 01:16:05,180
Yes, Mama. I think so.

676
01:16:22,663 --> 01:16:25,303
Um, excuse me.
- Come with me, please.

677
01:16:25,466 --> 01:16:26,968
That's my computer.
Why--?

678
01:16:27,134 --> 01:16:29,444
Why are you on my computer?
- Remain silent.

679
01:16:29,603 --> 01:16:31,674
You better not
mess up my favorites.

680
01:16:31,939 --> 01:16:35,148
We need a common base,
so let's try his eyes.

681
01:16:35,309 --> 01:16:38,449
Good. Now, let's see hands.

682
01:16:40,547 --> 01:16:42,322
Looking good. And now...

683
01:16:45,285 --> 01:16:46,889
Hm. Nice nose.

684
01:16:48,322 --> 01:16:51,633
Congratulations.
You have a girl.

685
01:16:51,792 --> 01:16:54,966
Print it. Get it out to all stations.

686
01:16:55,129 --> 01:16:56,699
And get the mobile unit ready.

687
01:16:56,864 --> 01:16:58,309
Yes, Sir.

688
01:17:25,993 --> 01:17:28,269
Hello?
It's me.

689
01:17:28,429 --> 01:17:31,171
Jen?
Are you busy?

690
01:17:31,331 --> 01:17:33,242
No. No, I'm not.

691
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,004
Danny Delaney.

692
01:17:35,169 --> 01:17:37,274
Localization in progress.

693
01:17:37,438 --> 01:17:39,349
I was just

694
01:17:39,506 --> 01:17:41,679
looking out the window
and thinking.

695
01:17:41,842 --> 01:17:43,685
Where are you?
I'm-- I'm at home.

696
01:17:43,844 --> 01:17:46,222
Looking out the window too.
We're looking

697
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:48,291
at the same sky now?
Almost.

698
01:17:48,449 --> 01:17:50,451
You have a sexy voice
on the phone.

699
01:17:50,617 --> 01:17:52,528
Yeah, you do too.

700
01:17:52,686 --> 01:17:54,029
Progress. We've got it.

701
01:17:54,188 --> 01:17:55,531
There it is.
We got it.

702
01:17:55,689 --> 01:17:57,896
Give SWAT the location.

703
01:17:58,892 --> 01:18:00,200
Let's go!

704
01:18:02,863 --> 01:18:05,036
I'm really glad you called me.
Me too.

705
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:07,702
I was just looking
at a picture of you

706
01:18:07,868 --> 01:18:09,779
when the phone rang.
Picture?

707
01:18:09,937 --> 01:18:12,577
I took a picture of you sleeping
with my phone.

708
01:18:12,739 --> 01:18:16,482
But I just wanted to have
something to remind me of you.

709
01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:20,380
Did you show it to anybody?
No. Well, actually, my friend Ryan.

710
01:18:20,547 --> 01:18:23,551
Who else saw the picture?
- Nobody. Why?

711
01:18:25,385 --> 01:18:26,386
Danny, who else?

712
01:18:26,553 --> 01:18:29,557
I didn't show it to anybody.
What's the big deal?

713
01:18:34,895 --> 01:18:37,466
I just took a picture
with my phone. I'm sorry.

714
01:18:37,631 --> 01:18:40,407
I'm sorry too. Oh, fuck.

715
01:18:58,118 --> 01:18:59,256
See what we got.

716
01:18:59,419 --> 01:19:01,763
Special Agent Williams. FBI.

717
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,366
It's clear.

718
01:19:47,134 --> 01:19:48,738
Shh. Unh.

719
01:19:48,902 --> 01:19:52,645
I mean, I really think, like,
he was publicly humiliated...

720
01:19:59,012 --> 01:20:00,355
Everything's under control.

721
01:20:00,514 --> 01:20:01,891
I need you to come with us.

722
01:20:02,049 --> 01:20:03,824
We're evacuating the building.

723
01:20:08,322 --> 01:20:09,824
Copy. Ten-four.

724
01:20:17,864 --> 01:20:19,002
Charges.

725
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:41,700
Blow it.

726
01:21:14,454 --> 01:21:18,231
No, she's not here.
Lock down this building ASAP.

727
01:21:48,121 --> 01:21:49,759
Anything?
No, nothing.

728
01:21:53,193 --> 01:21:55,696
No, wait, wait, wait.
One security camera down.

729
01:21:56,763 --> 01:21:57,935
Second down.
Where?

730
01:21:58,098 --> 01:22:00,305
The garage!
All units, get to the garage.

731
01:22:00,467 --> 01:22:02,970
Let's go. Let's go.
Cover all the damn exits.

732
01:22:39,973 --> 01:22:41,577
She's here!

733
01:22:43,310 --> 01:22:44,482
Look everywhere!

734
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,824
Under every oar.
Look in every boot.

735
01:22:48,982 --> 01:22:51,656
She's here. Find her!

736
01:22:54,654 --> 01:22:57,362
Anything? Come on.
Check that boot. In here.

737
01:23:30,223 --> 01:23:31,725
Mama.

738
01:23:56,316 --> 01:23:58,922
Mama!

739
01:24:06,893 --> 01:24:10,340
Emilio! Emilio!

740
01:24:42,863 --> 01:24:45,309
I'm sorry.

741
01:25:01,982 --> 01:25:03,461
Thank you.

742
01:25:30,577 --> 01:25:33,888
This won't take long.
Please, sit.

743
01:25:34,047 --> 01:25:35,526
You think
you've been smart.

744
01:25:36,416 --> 01:25:38,589
Have you covered
all your bases?

745
01:25:38,752 --> 01:25:41,665
Because this?
This is already over.

746
01:25:41,821 --> 01:25:44,028
This whole place
is wired with webcams.

747
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:45,999
You mean these?

748
01:25:47,327 --> 01:25:49,170
Talk about covering
all my bases.

749
01:25:49,329 --> 01:25:52,208
Your chair is pressure-wired.
You move a single inch,

750
01:25:52,365 --> 01:25:54,504
it'll be the last move
you ever make.

751
01:25:54,668 --> 01:25:56,773
And given what you
know about me,

752
01:25:56,937 --> 01:25:58,883
you know I don't bluff.

753
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:06,388
I don't know about you.

754
01:26:06,546 --> 01:26:08,025
So I'm just gonna ask.

755
01:26:08,181 --> 01:26:11,185
What happened to you
that you could kill 23 people?

756
01:26:11,351 --> 01:26:16,596
Would you believe me if I told you
this wasn't the life I had imagined

757
01:26:16,756 --> 01:26:18,963
when I was a child?

758
01:26:19,125 --> 01:26:22,265
I wanted to be like you,
on the other side.

759
01:26:22,429 --> 01:26:26,707
Really? So, what happened?

760
01:26:31,705 --> 01:26:33,207
Luis Sandoval.

761
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:37,581
I was 9
when he had my parents killed

762
01:26:37,744 --> 01:26:40,315
in front of me.

763
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,221
So all this?

764
01:26:42,782 --> 01:26:44,386
The rag Killing, the clues

765
01:26:45,251 --> 01:26:47,561
weren't for us at all.
It was all for him?

766
01:26:47,721 --> 01:26:49,257
Only way to track him down.

767
01:26:49,422 --> 01:26:51,732
You needed us
to put it all in the press?

768
01:26:51,891 --> 01:26:54,804
Yes, but it took you
so fucking long.

769
01:26:54,961 --> 01:26:57,601
Goddamn. You've had
to be really determined.

770
01:26:57,764 --> 01:27:01,678
Very focused, huh?
Not focused enough.

771
01:27:06,006 --> 01:27:10,421
This morning he took
the last piece of me.

772
01:27:10,577 --> 01:27:13,683
You sent the man a message,
he sent you one right back.

773
01:27:13,847 --> 01:27:16,088
And now
I'm gonna finish it.

774
01:27:16,249 --> 01:27:18,195
Oh, I can't help you.

775
01:27:18,351 --> 01:27:20,422
Yes, he's protected
by your government.

776
01:27:20,587 --> 01:27:23,625
By a part of my government
that I cannot reach.

777
01:27:23,790 --> 01:27:26,771
It's CIA, and I don't know why,
but I can't get under it.

778
01:27:26,926 --> 01:27:30,271
I can't get over it, and you have
to believe me, I have tried.

779
01:27:30,430 --> 01:27:32,205
Try harder, Agent Ross.

780
01:27:37,337 --> 01:27:39,112
You have a beautiful family.

781
01:27:39,272 --> 01:27:41,718
You go anywhere near my family,
and I swear to God, I will--

782
01:27:41,875 --> 01:27:43,115
Shh.

783
01:27:48,181 --> 01:27:49,990
Now you know
what you have to do.

784
01:27:50,150 --> 01:27:51,959
Get me Luis Sandoval.

785
01:27:52,118 --> 01:27:54,325
Because if you don't,

786
01:27:54,487 --> 01:27:58,025
you're going to go
to a funeral every week,

787
01:27:58,958 --> 01:28:01,632
and I will not stop
until you begin to feel

788
01:28:01,795 --> 01:28:03,638
what I felt all these years.

789
01:28:03,797 --> 01:28:05,504
I'm sorry.

790
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,245
Cataleya.

791
01:28:11,971 --> 01:28:14,349
When your dinner's ready,

792
01:28:14,507 --> 01:28:16,851
the timer in your chair
will have expired.

793
01:28:17,977 --> 01:28:19,820
Don't get up before.

794
01:28:22,148 --> 01:28:23,388
Hey!

795
01:28:37,197 --> 01:28:40,007
You do understand
that I only took this meeting

796
01:28:40,166 --> 01:28:41,941
out of professional courtesy.

797
01:28:42,102 --> 01:28:44,844
NOW, the truth is,
I really can't help you at all.

798
01:28:45,004 --> 01:28:47,848
Can't or won't?
It's the same thing, really.

799
01:28:48,007 --> 01:28:50,851
But in the spirit
of reaching out,

800
01:28:52,378 --> 01:28:54,688
let me put my cards on the table.
Yeah?

801
01:28:54,848 --> 01:28:56,350
I have met this woman,

802
01:28:56,516 --> 01:28:58,894
this Tag Killer.
It's a woman?

803
01:28:59,052 --> 01:29:00,360
Yeah.
Is she pretty?

804
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:02,966
She got the drop on me
in my home, told me

805
01:29:03,123 --> 01:29:06,195
that if I don't bring her
the whereabouts of this man,

806
01:29:06,359 --> 01:29:09,067
she's going to kill
a member of my family

807
01:29:09,229 --> 01:29:12,369
every week until I have none left.
Are you kidding me?

808
01:29:12,532 --> 01:29:15,706
Does it seem to you that I would
make something like this up?

809
01:29:15,869 --> 01:29:19,715
So why don't you just
tell me what I should do?

810
01:29:20,373 --> 01:29:21,545
Call 911.

811
01:29:21,708 --> 01:29:24,211
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a meeting.

812
01:29:24,377 --> 01:29:26,220
It starts now.

813
01:29:33,219 --> 01:29:34,664
Ross.

814
01:29:42,162 --> 01:29:45,234
It's her. If you don't give her
what she wants,

815
01:29:45,398 --> 01:29:49,312
she's going to redecorate
your whole office. With you.

816
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,582
Can you tell her that glass
is tempered to resist

817
01:29:56,743 --> 01:29:59,656
a direct hit
by a 57 mm ordinance?

818
01:30:12,025 --> 01:30:14,096
Ten seconds
to give up that address.

819
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:16,206
How can I be sure
she won't kill me?

820
01:30:16,362 --> 01:30:18,603
She says you can't,
but you can trust me.

821
01:30:18,765 --> 01:30:22,508
If you don't give her what she wants,
you will be her 24th victim.

822
01:30:22,669 --> 01:30:25,377
Eight-six-seven Magnolia Terrace,
New Orleans.

823
01:30:25,538 --> 01:30:28,519
She asked that you keep
this conversation confidential.

824
01:30:28,675 --> 01:30:30,154
With pleasure.

825
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:32,221
What about my family?

826
01:31:43,683 --> 01:31:45,856
Good morning. Who are you?

827
01:31:46,019 --> 01:31:47,259
That's not important.

828
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:49,957
What's important is,
I need the floor plans

829
01:31:50,123 --> 01:31:53,730
to 867 Magnolia Terrace.
If you don't leave immediately,

830
01:31:53,893 --> 01:31:55,702
I will call the police.

831
01:31:56,362 --> 01:31:59,036
I really need those floor plans.

832
01:32:01,935 --> 01:32:06,748
You will take positions
here, here and here.

833
01:32:06,906 --> 01:32:09,785
You must expect
the unexpected.

834
01:32:09,943 --> 01:32:13,390
She's like mist under a door,
like a mouse in the wall.

835
01:32:13,546 --> 01:32:15,492
She will never attack straight on,

836
01:32:15,648 --> 01:32:18,561
and you will not see her
until it's too late.

837
01:32:18,718 --> 01:32:21,756
She's that invisible.

838
01:32:25,992 --> 01:32:27,266
Shit! Marco!

839
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:56,525
Don Luis.

840
01:32:56,689 --> 01:32:58,600
Don Luis, are you okay?

841
01:33:00,026 --> 01:33:02,097
Get the Mercedes!

842
01:33:02,261 --> 01:33:04,104
What happened?
We need to get out.

843
01:33:04,263 --> 01:33:06,436
Leave me alone!
- Come on!

844
01:33:06,599 --> 01:33:08,306
Come on, come on!

845
01:33:09,369 --> 01:33:10,780
Everyone in!

846
01:33:43,469 --> 01:33:45,176
We have to move.

847
01:33:45,338 --> 01:33:47,011
Quick! Let's go!
Hurry up.

848
01:33:47,173 --> 01:33:48,311
Come on.

849
01:33:49,075 --> 01:33:51,316
You hide here.

850
01:33:51,844 --> 01:33:53,187
Wait for my call.
- Okay.

851
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,271
Come on! Find her!

852
01:34:09,429 --> 01:34:12,501
And look everywhere!

853
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:56,142
Hello.
- Did you catch her?

854
01:34:56,309 --> 01:34:57,811
We're checking it.

855
01:35:14,393 --> 01:35:15,463
I think we got her.

856
01:35:21,901 --> 01:35:23,642
Marco! Marco!

857
01:36:11,117 --> 01:36:12,687
Marco!

858
01:36:28,801 --> 01:36:30,303
What the hell is going on?

859
01:36:30,469 --> 01:36:32,642
I will hold here.
Marco!

860
01:37:01,901 --> 01:37:05,178
You've been waiting for this
moment for a long time, right?

861
01:37:05,338 --> 01:37:06,578
Yes.

862
01:40:05,684 --> 01:40:07,129
Marco?

863
01:40:07,286 --> 01:40:08,924
CATALEYA I
No.

864
01:40:09,388 --> 01:40:11,129
It's Cataleya.

865
01:40:11,290 --> 01:40:12,894
What were you expecting?

866
01:40:13,058 --> 01:40:15,698
You have ruined
your whole life trying to kill me.

867
01:40:15,861 --> 01:40:17,033
Someone like me?

868
01:40:17,263 --> 01:40:20,142
I cannot be killed. I do the killing.

869
01:40:20,299 --> 01:40:22,905
And now it's your tum to be hunted.

870
01:40:23,102 --> 01:40:24,911
You will never find me.

871
01:40:25,237 --> 01:40:28,081
But as day follows night,
believe me,

872
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:31,619
I'll find you, and I will kill you!
And you know why?

873
01:40:31,777 --> 01:40:35,384
Because I will never be
where you want me to be.

874
01:40:36,215 --> 01:40:37,956
Actually...

875
01:40:39,952 --> 01:40:42,432
you're exactly where
I want you to be.

876
01:40:42,588 --> 01:40:43,589
Huh?

877
01:40:47,159 --> 01:40:49,332
Aah!
Eat.

878
01:41:17,156 --> 01:41:19,466
You should think very carefully.

879
01:41:20,092 --> 01:41:23,164
Is there anything else?
I've already told you everything.

880
01:41:23,329 --> 01:41:26,333
She'd come by for a couple of hours,
then she'd leave.

881
01:41:26,499 --> 01:41:29,503
It's late, I'm tired.
If you are not gonna arrest me...

882
01:41:29,668 --> 01:41:32,649
We don't actually have
anything to charge you with.

883
01:41:33,272 --> 01:41:35,274
So can I leave?
No.

884
01:41:35,441 --> 01:41:37,284
I got a few more
questions.

885
01:41:38,444 --> 01:41:42,358
Can I at least get a cup of coffee?
Yeah.

886
01:41:44,350 --> 01:41:45,385
Cream and sugar?

887
01:41:45,551 --> 01:41:47,531
Yes, please.

888
01:41:54,159 --> 01:41:56,662
Hello?
Hello?

889
01:41:56,829 --> 01:41:59,810
Jen. Thank God.
Look, I had no idea.

890
01:41:59,965 --> 01:42:02,377
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

891
01:42:02,535 --> 01:42:04,674
I'm fine.

892
01:42:04,837 --> 01:42:07,317
Where are you?
FBI.

893
01:42:07,473 --> 01:42:11,421
Danny, you know that they--
Yeah.

894
01:42:11,577 --> 01:42:13,716
How much time do we have?

895
01:42:13,879 --> 01:42:15,859
Forty seconds.

896
01:42:16,015 --> 01:42:20,486
Use this time for three questions.
What's your real name?

897
01:42:22,488 --> 01:42:24,365
Cataleya.

898
01:42:24,523 --> 01:42:26,366
Like the flower?

899
01:42:27,526 --> 01:42:30,166
Yes. Like the flower.

900
01:42:30,329 --> 01:42:31,774
Twenty-two seconds.

901
01:42:31,931 --> 01:42:35,105
Will my little bird
come back one day?

902
01:42:37,336 --> 01:42:40,078
Leave your window open
and you'll see.

903
01:42:41,607 --> 01:42:42,915
Hey, Ross!
Yeah?

904
01:42:43,075 --> 01:42:45,578
We're picking something up
off that guy's phone.

905
01:42:46,211 --> 01:42:48,088
Last question.

906
01:42:48,881 --> 01:42:50,519
I love you.

907
01:42:53,686 --> 01:42:57,634
Give me that phone.
Give it. Hello?

908
01:42:58,023 --> 01:42:59,764
Hello?

909
01:43:19,144 --> 01:43:20,885
You can go.

910
01:43:39,765 --> 01:43:43,338
# I hurt myself today#

911
01:43:45,471 --> 01:43:49,248
# To see if I still feel#

912
01:43:50,576 --> 01:43:54,683
# I focus on the pain#

913
01:43:56,081 --> 01:44:00,086
# The only thing that's real#

914
01:44:01,286 --> 01:44:05,098
# The needle tears a hole#

915
01:44:06,759 --> 01:44:10,468
# The old familiar sting#

916
01:44:11,463 --> 01:44:16,139
# Try to kill it all away#

917
01:44:16,635 --> 01:44:21,345
# But I remember everything#

918
01:44:22,941 --> 01:44:26,286
# What have I become#

919
01:44:28,714 --> 01:44:31,627
# My sweetest friend#

920
01:44:33,452 --> 01:44:36,956
# Everyone I know#

921
01:44:37,456 --> 01:44:42,405
# Goes away in the end#

922
01:44:43,662 --> 01:44:47,804
# And you could have it all#

923
01:44:49,301 --> 01:44:52,839
# My empire of dirt#

924
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:57,987
# I will let you down#

925
01:44:59,678 --> 01:45:03,490
# I will make you hurt#

926
01:45:14,893 --> 01:45:19,569
# I wear this crown of thorns#

927
01:45:20,566 --> 01:45:24,514
# Upon my liar's chair#

928
01:45:26,171 --> 01:45:29,675
# Full of broken thoughts#

929
01:45:31,510 --> 01:45:35,253
# I cannot repair#

930
01:45:36,348 --> 01:45:40,353
# Beneath the stains of time#

931
01:45:41,754 --> 01:45:45,395
# The feelings disappear#

932
01:45:47,259 --> 01:45:50,934
# You are someone else#

933
01:45:52,698 --> 01:45:56,202
# I am still right here#

934
01:45:57,970 --> 01:46:01,315
# What have I become#

935
01:46:03,876 --> 01:46:06,823
# My sweetest friend#

936
01:46:08,547 --> 01:46:11,824
# Everyone I know#

937
01:46:12,551 --> 01:46:17,261
# Goes away in the end#

938
01:46:18,757 --> 01:46:22,330
# And you could have it all#

939
01:46:24,329 --> 01:46:27,776
# My empire of dirt#

940
01:46:29,635 --> 01:46:33,082
# I will let you down#

941
01:46:34,807 --> 01:46:38,118
# I will make you hurt#

942
01:46:39,678 --> 01:46:43,524
# If I could start again#

943
01:46:44,917 --> 01:46:48,592
# A million miles away#

944
01:46:50,355 --> 01:46:53,598
# I would keep myself#

945
01:46:55,494 --> 01:47:00,534
# I would find a way#

946
01:47:01,305 --> 01:48:01,580
