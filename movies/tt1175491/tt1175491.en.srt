2
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
And now...

3
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,800
...ladies and gentlemen...

4
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,725
...the 43rd president of the United States...

5
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,700
...George W. Bush.

6
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,940
Axis of Hatred?
- I know.

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,600
Something about it...

8
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,000
...just misses.
- Any other brilliant ideas?

9
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,300
How about Axis of Weasels?

10
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,300
Don't get cute, Karl.
This is serious now.

11
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,900
I think it needs to be stronger.

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,500
Just cut through the noise. Like
Reagan with the 'Evil Empire' speech.

13
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,320
Well, is it too much then to...?

14
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,900
What about Axis of Evil?

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,600
Axis of Evil?

16
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,250
Evil? Yeah, I like the ring of that.
That's good.

17
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,900
Mr. President,
'axis' brings up World War II.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,950
You can't link Germany and Japan
with Iraq and North Korea.

19
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,100
No, I... I disagree, Colin.

20
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,050
Weapons of mass destruction make
these countries more dangerous.

21
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:09,000
We gotta begin educating the public
about this war and its implications.

22
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,850
You have an approval rating
of more than 80 percent now.

23
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,300
It's just astounding.

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,000
Not since Roosevelt after Pearl Harbor.

25
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,100
The American people want revenge.
They liked Afghanistan.

26
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,200
They want more.

27
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,300
Mr. President, if I may?

28
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,400
Given your strong commitment
to democracy...

29
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,200
...do you think that Iran
should be lumped together...

30
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,800
...with Iraq and North Korea?

31
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,500
After all, Iran has
a democratically elected president.

32
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,800
As always, Guru, sharp.
- Thank you.

33
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,350
Iran is not Iraq and Iraq is not Iran.
I know that.

34
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,000
If we can get one democracy going
in one of these places, Iran, Iraq?

35
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,950
Reagan was right. It's gonna spread
to all these countries...

36
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,500
...because people want freedom.

37
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,750
With this message, we're sending
strong word to reformers in Iran...

38
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,800
...to turn on these deadbeat dead-enders...

39
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,650
...these ayatollah cockamamies.
Iran stays in.

40
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,100
When you make threats, sir,
you have to back them up.

41
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,000
You'd be committing us to planning...

42
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,450
...three fully operational wars
with three countries.

43
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,500
No, I'm not saying war.
I'm saying lay down the law.

44
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,100
But the speech as written
is taking a preemptive posture...

45
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,700
...against countries,
none of whom declared war on us.

46
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,050
For 60 years now, this country...

47
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,500
...has operated under a principle
of containment.

48
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,800
That's a defense, general,
not an offense.

49
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,200
How are you gonna contain
100,000 lunatics...

50
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,200
...running around with fake passports...

51
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,450
...from country to country,
looking for nukes, anthrax?

52
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,300
Containment don't hold water
as far as I'm concerned.

53
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,500
We're gonna get hit again.
We all know that.

54
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,400
Unless we go out there,
hit them hard, and we hit them first.

55
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,300
Well,
containment won us the Cold War.

56
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,500
Some people might just say that
Reagan won the Cold War, general.

57
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,800
And it started
with the 'Empire of Evil' speech.

58
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,000
What do you think?

59
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,600
Oh, Mr. President, you know I don't
do nuance. It's just not my thing.

60
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,800
I'll keep to the big picture if you don't mind.

61
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,300
I do. Brother George?

62
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,700
Think?

63
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,950
Well, actually there's about 80,000 of
them, terrorists, in about 80 countries.

64
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,300
My point exactly.

65
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,600
And I'm sure you realize, of course,
what complicates things is...

66
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,700
...it wasn't Iran or Iraq who attacked us.

67
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,000
It was Osama bin Laden.

68
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,000
I know it was bin Laden, George.
You know as well as I do...

69
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,200
...there's more terrorists out there...

70
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,400
...than a religious nut in a cave in Pakistan.

71
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,150
Wolfie, you got that look on your face.
- Well, sir, to get back to the point...

72
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,300
...lran is the issue here.

73
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,290
It is the mothership of terrorism.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Vice?

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,355
Sir, as you know, I don't view
this issue as a matter of choice.

76
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,390
Since 9l11, there's no going back.

77
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,900
Well, then...

78
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,700
...we'll go with Axis of Evil.
- Yes, Mr. President.

79
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,200
And now I'm tired of this sentence.

80
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,380
All right, before we go,
let's all take a moment.

81
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
You too, turdblossom.

82
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,300
Do infants enjoy infancy...

83
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,900
...as much as adults enjoy adultery?

84
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,500
Let's go. Go.

85
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,950
Why do kamikaze pilots wear seat belts?

86
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,400
Because the Japs are crazy.

87
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,600
That's wrong. And you all suffer.

88
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,100
Buxenhall,
you worthless piece of horseshit.

89
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,580
Sing 'The Whiffenpoof Song.'

90
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,810
I can't hear you.
- Louder.

91
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Yeah.

92
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,400
Lovely.

93
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,200
So...

94
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,360
...enjoying ourselves, I see.
- Yeah.

95
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:24,150
Good evening, young fellow
Delta Kappsters in waiting.

96
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,900
This is pledge week.

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,500
If you make the grade,
you'll become a brother.

98
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,700
Delta Kappa brothers are men of honor...

99
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,200
...decency...

100
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,700
...and God-given character.

101
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Yeah.
- Yeah.

102
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,900
That, along with our family fortunes, is
why we rule the world. Right, Jimmy?

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,100
Right.

104
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,400
But...

105
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,000
...until you are Delta Kappsters...

106
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,000
...you are all still pieces of garbage.

107
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,400
You, Buxenhall, quick.

108
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,200
How many of these brothers do you know?

109
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,300
Name every brother in this room.
Now.

110
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,900
Dieter...

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,900
...Hotchkiss, Austin, Hill, Coors.

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,300
No good.
- Sanders...

113
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,200
Seven. Seven out of 40. That's it?

114
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,700
Maybe you'll remember better with a drink.

115
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Yeah.

116
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,100
And what about you?

117
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,450
You think you can do any better,
Mister Pussy?

118
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,600
Yes, sir.
- Are you ready for your bath?

119
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,900
I think I can do better.

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Let's hear.

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,800
'Cape Cod' Cartner...

122
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,100
...Scotty 'Scotch and soda' Sonnenberg...

123
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,600
...Paul 'Putting-on-the-Rich' Richardson...

124
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,700
...Jackie 'Jambalaya' Jackson...

125
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,500
...Paul 'Poodle' Johnson...

126
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,950
...Marky 'Pit Bull' Phillips,
Ollie 'Octopus' Givens...

127
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,500
...John 'Cranky' Olinger...

128
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,550
...Sammy 'Sloppy Seconds' Woods,
Jeremiah 'Crusher' Adams...

129
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,500
...Howie 'Gringo' Givens...

130
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,900
...Adam 'Lazy' Greenwood...

131
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,650
We have got a working brain here.
- Yeah.

132
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,800
He may be from Texas...

133
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,400
...but he's gonna be
one great Delta Kappster.

134
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,900
Sir, I'm working for that.

135
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
You legacy?

136
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,600
Yeah, father, grandfather, all the way
back to great, great grandfather.

137
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,900
Yeah, for any ignoramuses
who don't know...

138
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,700
...his grandfather Prescott...

139
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,000
...is our esteemed senator
from Connecticut.

140
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,000
My father's running for Congress in Texas.

141
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,100
Yeah.

142
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,700
Planning on following
in their footsteps there, Bushie?

143
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Hell, no. No way in the world
I'd wanna do that.

144
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,100
Congressman George Bush.

145
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,835
May I please speak with my son?

146
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,100
Daddy's on the phone.
- Hey, tell your mom I said hi.

147
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,500
Wait here. I'll be right back.
- Help us out here, Bush.

148
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,255
I'll be right back.
- Don't forget about us.

149
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,600
Hello, Pop. Is that you?

150
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,500
What's this about?

151
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,200
What kind of trouble you in now?

152
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,300
Oh, it's penny ante. I swear, Poppy.

153
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,800
Hey, we beat Princeton.

154
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,400
Won the darn championship.

155
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,500
We were tearing down the goal posts.
I was hanging on the crossbar.

156
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,500
But they arrested me on account of
me being head cheerleader, I'm sure.

157
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,100
Hill and Dowling had great games.
I mean, we kicked their butts.

158
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,100
The only thing better than beating
Princeton, beating Harvard.

159
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,850
You beat both of them when you won
the championship.

160
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,800
Went to the first College World Series.

161
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,300
The first two college national
championships.

162
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,250
Forty-seven and '48.
Right after you were born.

163
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,900
There are still photos of you...

164
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,700
...and that team up on the walls
of Delta Kappa.

165
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,900
Tell you, things in this life
you wish you could go back, do over.

166
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,500
I could field, but I couldn't hit.

167
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,900
Went 0 for 3 against Cal in the finals.

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,300
How history goes.

169
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,500
Still, you were on the greatest
Yale baseball team of all time.

170
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,800
My father
would've kicked the crap out of me...

171
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,900
...if I ended up where you are now, Junior.

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,400
They're gonna let me go, Poppy.

173
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,400
I have to get out of New Jersey
and promise never to come back.

174
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,880
Which is okey-dokey with me.

175
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,280
Don't work that way, Junior.

176
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,800
Not to me, not to this family.

177
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,900
Now, I'm getting you out of this,
this time.

178
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,400
I don't wanna get
any more phone calls like this again.

179
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,300
Ever.

180
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,800
You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

181
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,300
Where is your grease gun?
- It's up there.

182
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Quit messing with me.

183
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,500
Manuel.
- Get your butt back in here.

184
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,900
I thought you just wanted me
to go up there just now.

185
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Shit.

186
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,340
What happened?
- I think the bearing stopped.

187
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,650
Hey, watch this for me, will you?
- Okay.

188
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,800
Watch it.
- Okay.

189
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Hey, Miguel.

190
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,400
Is that too hot?
- Yeah.

191
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,300
Damn.

192
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,500
I need some help out here.

193
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,100
Bush, what you doing off the floor?
Shift's not over till 1800.

194
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,240
I'm having a drink, sir.

195
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Get back there.
The motor's overheating.

196
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,000
I need every swinging dick I got.

197
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Yeah, I know that.
But, sir, you see, I'm about parched.

198
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,650
You know, I just need
a couple of minutes here.

199
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,500
You already had your break. This ain't
some fancy-ass Ivy League school.

200
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,100
Now, haul that butt of yours
back out to your motor...

201
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,100
...before something else happens.

202
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,495
All right. You know, sir...

203
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,800
...I think this butt of mine just quit.
- That the way you want it?

204
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,640
That's fine with me.
Get your ass off my rig.

205
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,400
I'll just get the next coach out.

206
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
Thank you.

207
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,950
Look, how many times
do I gotta tell you? You are my gal.

208
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,000
I mean, I'm as happy as a rabbit
in a carrot patch with you.

209
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,900
But you never say the words.

210
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,200
What words?

211
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,700
The L word.

212
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,900
The L word? What, lesbian?
You're no lesbian.

213
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,700
What future are we gonna have
if you're always joking?

214
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,700
Come on, Fran, I'm crazy about you.

215
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
Okay?
We're gonna go back to Houston.

216
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,400
We're gonna have a big church
wedding. All the trimmings. All of it.

217
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,100
What kind of church?

218
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,300
I grew up Episcopalian.
I grew up Presbyterian...

219
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,900
...and then I turned into Episcopalian.

220
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Well, I'm a Baptist.

221
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,650
Episcopalian, Baptist,
what the hell does it matter?

222
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,700
You're gonna be one of us, a Bush.
How does that sound, sweetheart?

223
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,100
You mean it? You swear it?

224
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,300
Look, then we're gonna move
to New York. You ever been there?

225
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,900
Bright lights, big city.
It's even bigger than Dallas.

226
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,050
I'm gonna work on Wall Street.
I got an uncle who's gonna set me up.

227
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:29,000
Told me, 'Just say the word.'

228
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,800
You gotta picture a boatload of money.

229
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,700
We're gonna be on a big boat
with lots of money.

230
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,500
New York?
- Yup.

231
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,700
I never dreamt of that.

232
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,300
Start dreaming now.

233
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
George.
- Yeah?

234
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,600
Are you proposing to me?

235
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,660
If I had a rock big enough,
I'd give it to you right now.

236
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,300
Freddie Mac, here we go,
two more shots.

237
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,200
Oh, I love this song. Come on, honey.

238
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,750
Come on. Get on up here, girl.
- What are you doing? You're crazy.

239
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,850
Come on, baby.

240
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,100
Yeah.

241
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,800
Come on, my boy.

242
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,100
Damn right, brother.

243
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,600
See you later, George. Tell Barbara hi.
- Junior.

244
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,800
Thanks for coming.
- W.

245
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,800
Hey, guys.

246
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,700
Tell him... Tell him that I won't be able
to do that till 3.

247
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,775
No, that's the soonest I can do it.

248
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,040
And hold my phone calls.

249
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,600
Let's see now. Sit down.

250
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,500
If I remember correctly, you didn't like
the sporting-goods job...

251
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,000
...or the oil-rig job.

252
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,300
Working in the investment firm
wasn't for you either.

253
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,650
That ranch-hand thing, Arizona.
That sure didn't last long.

254
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,400
Didn't exactly finish up...

255
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,350
...with flying colors
in the Air National Guard, Junior.

256
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,300
We're still not out of that one.

257
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,250
Now this gal, Suzie. Shooting off
her mouth about you knocking her up.

258
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,500
Wait. How did you know about that?
- Word gets around, boy.

259
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,700
That's a danged lie, Poppy.

260
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,600
I used a condom. I'm not dumb.

261
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,800
What are you cut out for?

262
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,500
Partying, chasing tail, driving drunk?

263
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,600
What do you think you are?
A Kennedy?

264
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,600
You're a Bush. Act like one.

265
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,600
You can't even hold a job.

266
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,500
We always worked for our living.

267
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,400
It's time you joined the rest of us...

268
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,100
...and decided what it is
you're gonna do with your life.

269
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,800
I know, Poppy.

270
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,900
I'm just having a devil of a time
trying to figure it out.

271
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,400
Well, then figure it out soon, Junior.

272
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,400
Your brother Jeb
graduates Phi Beta Kappa.

273
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,600
What did you get? Cs?

274
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,700
You only get one bite at the apple.

275
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,050
Well, Jeb's not me
and I don't wanna be Jeb, Poppy.

276
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,500
Look, what I'd really love...

277
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,750
I mean, what I'd really love to do
is to find something in baseball.

278
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,850
What? You can't play.

279
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,950
Coach? You're fishing
for the moon in the water.

280
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,400
Something real.

281
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,850
I started out in the oil fields.
I was hoping that...

282
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:43,000
No, I'll try harder, Poppy, I promise.

283
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,100
No, I can do it.

284
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,100
Can you? Can you really?

285
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
You agreed to work for a period of time...

286
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,380
...and you haven't
kept your word once. Not once.

287
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,000
In our family, the Bush family...

288
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,500
...we honor our commitments.

289
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,200
I'll take care of this...

290
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,700
...young woman.

291
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,500
You disappoint me, Junior.

292
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,200
Deeply disappoint me.

293
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Is that it?

294
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,900
Yeah.

295
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Almost three minutes behind, Rafael.
Pick up the pace.

296
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,050
My running times are better than ever
since the Afghan invasion.

297
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,100
I'm back down from 7-minute miles
to the 6:45s.

298
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,700
I mean, honestly, I'm probably
the fastest president in history.

299
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,300
I heard your father
was a pretty good runner too.

300
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,100
Yeah, second fastest, maybe.

301
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,300
He had endurance,
but not my kind of speed.

302
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,600
What about Clinton?

303
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,000
My mother waddles faster than that lardass.

304
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,200
And my pulse is only 35I 40.
You need to get in shape, Vice.

305
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,500
We need you around.
Three heart attacks is three too many.

306
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,900
Thank you.

307
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Mr. President...

308
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:19,250
...if there was an E. coli breakout
in a produce farm in Maryland...

309
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,950
...would you take the chance of eating
the lettuce in that sandwich?

310
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,500
Why are you bringing this up?

311
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,800
I mean, you know I got tasters
in the kitchen.

312
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,600
If there was a 1 percent chance
of you dying, sir...

313
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,300
...would you eat the lettuce
in that sandwich?

314
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,400
One percent?

315
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,100
No. Probably not.

316
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,000
Most people wouldn't, sir.

317
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,000
And that's the dark side.

318
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,450
The 1 percent chance of a nuclear
attack, or an anthrax epidemic...

319
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,300
...or God help us,
a smallpox outbreak.

320
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,700
We'd have 200 million Americans
dead on our hands.

321
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,900
Why are you bringing this up at lunch?

322
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,400
Vice, I mean, you know
I agree with you on this.

323
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,950
Because I'm more worried now
than I was on 9l11.

324
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,280
And you know how disorganized we were.

325
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,100
I just wanna know
where you're going with this.

326
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Mr. President...

327
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,500
...this is a fulcrum point in history.
Your presidency.

328
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,200
The Middle East, 9l11,
homeland security.

329
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,150
Everything is coming together
like a perfect storm.

330
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,300
Now, with all due respect, sir...

331
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,300
...I don't think this executive branch
is ready for that.

332
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,100
Didn't we get the Patriot Act through?
- Doesn't go far enough, sir.

333
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,800
All right, Vice, so, what do you want
me to do that I haven't already done?

334
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,400
I mean, look, we're on top of the
banks, the telecoms, the databases...

335
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,400
...these Internet carriers.

336
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,100
We're tracking, what,
a billion phone calls a day?

337
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,550
We got this Guantanemera open.
- Guantanamo.

338
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,400
Nobody's gonna be hearing
from those people for a long time.

339
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,100
Sir, I served your father.

340
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,400
And he was an able and honorable man.

341
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,900
And he won the Iraq war.

342
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,100
But he, myself and Powell...

343
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,700
...we let that momentum slip away.

344
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,900
And if we hadn't...

345
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,800
...we wouldn't be looking down
the barrel of another 9l11.

346
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,800
I told my father the same thing back then:

347
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,900
'Take the sucker out.'

348
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,850
So, what do you think the odds are
that Saddam's got nukes?

349
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:25,150
Well, according to our sources,
90 percent.

350
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,300
But even if it was 1 percent...
- You don't have to sell me.

351
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
We gotta sell the American people...

352
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
...okay, and Colin.

353
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,100
The Commander in Chief
doesn't have to sell anything.

354
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,750
He has constitutionally
unlimited power in wartime.

355
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:43,270
And you have the capacity
to do anything you see fit.

356
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,300
Okay.

357
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,000
What's that thing you got there?

358
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,100
This is a sign-off.

359
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,300
It authorizes us...

360
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,450
...to use 'interrogation techniques...

361
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:58,000
...against unlawful enemy combatants...

362
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,330
...with maximal effective persuasion.'

363
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,500
Like pulling out their toenails?

364
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,600
No sir.
Enhanced interrogation techniques...

365
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,000
...means utilizing fear scenarios...

366
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,150
...like dogs or isolation...

367
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,800
...or simulated drowning
or sleep deprivation...

368
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:22,150
...or enforced stress positions,
but nothing fatal.

369
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,285
Kind of reminds me of my fraternity days.

370
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,100
Remember,
we don't use torture in this country.

371
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,500
No torture.

372
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,000
But it includes our citizens too.

373
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,775
If they are aiding and abetting
terrorist organizations.

374
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,100
Makes sense.

375
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,450
Still, I can see all these
latte-sipping lefties going nuts again.

376
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,200
The Kyoto bullshit was bad enough.

377
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,500
Now it'll be all the sobbing
over the Geneva Convention.

378
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,725
Let me take a look at it.

379
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,700
Only three pages? Good.

380
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,100
The Office of Legal Counsel
is with us on this one.

381
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,850
I got it, Vice, I'll look at it.
- If we sign this week...

382
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,600
...with Congress in recess,
we're gonna have less nonsense.

383
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,335
I said, I'll look at it.
- Okay.

384
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,635
I'll let you finish your lunch.

385
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,100
Oh, Vice...

386
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,000
...when we're in meetings with others...

387
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,700
...I just want you to keep a lid on it.

388
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,000
I thought I was, sir.

389
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,800
No, you heard me.
Just keep your ego in check.

390
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,900
You know, because, remember,
I'm the president.

391
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm the decider.

392
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,080
I totally agree, sir.
- Okay.

393
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,450
Ninety, 45, 90 is the plan, sir.
Two hundred and twenty-five days.

394
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,700
Ninety for prep.

395
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,900
Moving 150,000 troops into Kuwait...

396
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,450
...building the airfields,
moving equipment.

397
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,800
Then air strikes for 45 days.

398
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,000
Then 90 days of ground combat.
- A hundred and fifty thousand men?

399
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,900
I mean, I'm not looking
to play small ball here, Tommy.

400
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,900
We put 500,000 pairs of boots
on the ground, Desert Storm.

401
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,600
We planned for any possibility.

402
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,700
I think the Pentagon can wrestle
this thing down to 100,000.

403
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,300
Go light. Like Afghanistan.

404
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,900
Blitz the bejesus out of them from the air.

405
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,900
Total shock and awe, Mr. President.

406
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,800
Shock and awe. I like it. I like that.

407
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,200
So when can we go?

408
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,600
Well, January,
February, March is best.

409
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,100
What about April, May, June?

410
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,400
No, you can't start a war in Iraq after March.

411
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,200
They got scorchers out there,
burn the hide off a scorpion.

412
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,400
All right.
I can run in that kind of heat.

413
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,450
Not with a biohazard suit on, you can't, sir.

414
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,600
I like the cut of your jib, Tommy.

415
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,200
I don't mean to rain
on Tommy's parade here, sir.

416
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,900
If you go through with this,
you're gonna be the owner...

417
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,800
...of 26 million Iraqi people
standing around looking at us.

418
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,000
You break it, you own it.
And I can tell you something.

419
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,100
You need to understand.

420
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,000
It's gonna suck the oxygen
right out of everything you do.

421
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,600
It will become your first term.

422
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,800
Your father weighed this when we
weighed the merits of the Gulf War.

423
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,150
Well, that may be so, Colin, but
my dad's fishing at Kennebunkport...

424
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,100
...and Saddam's still dicking us around.

425
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,700
I didn't say we're going yet.

426
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,400
I still think we can use
that 52nd card, you know...

427
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,300
...proof that he's got the WMDs.

428
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,300
You mean the 53rd card,
sir, the joker?

429
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,600
No, that would be you,
Brother George.

430
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,700
Hey, whoa, fellas.

431
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,920
I think we missed the side road.

432
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,090
Sir, I presume we'll win this war.

433
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,200
Then what?

434
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,900
What is our exit strategy?

435
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,950
Well, the DOD has already drawn up
initial plans for a post-Hussein era...

436
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:07,600
...which would include the exercise of
democracy and a free-market economy.

437
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,000
Well, I'm glad State's been consulted.

438
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,850
What type of government is DOD
talking about putting in Iraq?

439
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,300
Come on, Spotty.
Make me proud, girl.

440
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,400
Look, fellas,
in the end it's about freedom.

441
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
A free country is a peaceful country.

442
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,700
My dream is to see peace break out
all over the Middle East.

443
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,050
So any kind of government will do.
As long as it's a democracy.

444
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,600
Indeed.

445
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,500
Yeah, the cars are this way.

446
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,200
Half a mile maybe. Follow me.

447
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,400
Boy, we're not seeing that guy today.

448
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,600
Well, this is a guy
who got hurt in practice...

449
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,700
So just a lot of development there.

450
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,500
He wasn't the starter for the first half
of the season...

451
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,700
...so he's continuing to evolve.

452
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,500
They're at 11,
they need to get to the 25.

453
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,900
Randall under pressure,
the ball is loose...

454
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,200
...and Texas has it.

455
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,700
Yes.
- Will go all the way, touchdown...

456
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,800
Yes.
- ... Longhorns.

457
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Redding knocked it loose...

458
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,425
...and Jackson cashes in.

459
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,300
Hey, give me that, little brother.

460
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,200
That's enough.

461
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,300
That's enough.

462
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,300
Poppy.

463
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
We're here.

464
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,400
We made it. Yeah.

465
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,700
Come on.

466
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,400
Marvin, go to your room.

467
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,400
Do what your dad says.
- What the hell...

468
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,700
...do you think you're doing?
- What?

469
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,500
He's only 15.

470
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,800
I've had just about enough of your crap.

471
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,900
You had enough of me?

472
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,300
I'm mighty glad to hear that.

473
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,000
Because I've had enough of you...

474
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,900
...for a lifetime...

475
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
...and then some.
- My advice to you, Junior:

476
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,800
Get yourself to an AA meeting. Get help.

477
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,250
Thank you, Mr., what, Perfect,
Mr. War Hero, Mr. God Almighty.

478
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,300
Don't you talk to your father that way.

479
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,100
I'll talk to him however I want to.

480
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,250
When in tarnation is this boy
gonna get out of his own way?

481
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,200
How many chances
do you expect us to give?

482
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,100
Can't you talk to me?

483
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,900
Well, why do you tell her?
That's it. Let's go.

484
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,300
Mano a mano.

485
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,700
You and me. Right here. Right now.

486
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,400
You want an ass-whipping?
- Yeah.

487
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,950
I'll give it to you.
- Jeb, do something.

488
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,300
Both of you, just stop it.

489
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
Have you lost your minds?
- Try it, old man.

490
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,300
Go ahead. Take a swing.
- Hey, calm down.

491
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,600
Don't you realize he was out celebrating?

492
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,000
He just got into Harvard Business.
- What?

493
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,200
George, why didn't you tell us?

494
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,500
Because I ain't going.

495
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,250
Okay? I just wanted to show you all
that I could do it. Get in.

496
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,400
Love me now?
- Calm down. He'll...

497
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,800
He'll change his mind.

498
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,600
I wouldn't count on it,
Jebbie, old boy.

499
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,150
George.
- You scared me half to death.

500
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:36,050
All right, now, he got into Harvard.
Will you give him a little credit?

501
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:40,300
Of course he got in.
Who do you think pulled the strings?

502
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
You did.

503
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,800
That's 20. Stay in.

504
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,600
How about that?

505
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,100
Excuse me. Excuse me.

506
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,900
All right. Here we go.

507
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Oh, come on.

508
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,600
My income for the week.

509
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,100
Bush, you're just fleecing us tonight.

510
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
You're better at poker than finding oil.

511
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,700
Is it my fault the good Lord
didn't put oil where I been digging?

512
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,100
Don't ask us to invest any more
in your dry well.

513
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,900
Hey, Corn Dog. You remember this.

514
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,100
You invest in me, you'll get
your money back and plenty more.

515
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,100
Better start shaking
that money tree somehow.

516
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,350
Well, the great peanut farmer
and rabbit hunter, Jimmy Carter...

517
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,600
...sure ain't helping. Solar panels
on the roof of the White House?

518
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,700
Big government taxes are back, boys.

519
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Amen to that.

520
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,000
Hope and pray your daddy
can take him out in 1980.

521
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,700
He's gotta get past Reagan first.

522
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,300
Your dad's a true statesman.

523
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,700
He can take out
that Hollywood actor, right, W?

524
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,100
Hey, Jimmy, what if I tell you...

525
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,600
...that I'm ready to get
in the family business myself.

526
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,400
You're not talking about oil now?

527
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,700
No, I ain't.
No, I'm ready to take a shot.

528
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,100
Because a sign has come unto me.

529
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,300
What has come unto you?

530
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,400
This July 6th, what notable event
happened right here in West Texas?

531
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,800
You're birthday, wasn't it?

532
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,100
We already celebrated.

533
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,400
Yes, and George Mahon announced...

534
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,200
...his retirement from Congress
after 44 years.

535
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,100
That's right.
- What a coincidence.

536
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
This, and right on my birthday.

537
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,400
And now that he's gone, boys,
the 19th District...

538
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,200
...is in play for a Republican.

539
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,400
And that Republican is going to be...?

540
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,700
Yours truly, Skeeter.

541
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,950
Hope you don't forget us little people
when you're in the Capital.

542
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:32,500
Well, saddle up our horses, boys,
and send George W. to Washington.

543
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,500
Hey.
- What I like to hear.

544
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,500
Both of them?
That would be Bush City.

545
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,600
Bush City.

546
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,700
Bushington.

547
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,100
Thank you.
- All right, you all gotta meet...

548
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,900
...my husband.
This is Don. Don Evans.

549
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,465
How do you do? I'm Don Evans.

550
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,700
Oh, George.

551
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,500
Hey, Suzie, how are you?

552
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,000
Good to see you. Skeeter.

553
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,600
What's up, Bush? How you doing?

554
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,000
Can I get that beer, Jan?
Thank you, honey.

555
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,300
You give me that laundry right here.

556
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,535
I have to borrow him for one...

557
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,250
Laura.
- Yo, give me a burger, will you?

558
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,200
You got it.
- Yeah? All right.

559
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,900
Laura, come here.

560
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,500
I'd like for you to meet George Bush Jr.

561
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,750
Laura Welch.
- You can call me anything but Junior.

562
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,500
You know, I remember seeing you
in school.

563
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,450
We were in the 7th grade together
at San Jacinto Junior High.

564
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,300
San Jacinto, yeah.

565
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,400
Year after I moved to Houston.

566
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,800
I don't know how I could have missed
seeing someone as pretty as you are.

567
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,400
Because I wasn't a cheerleader.
- That could be it.

568
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,350
I've only been trying to get you two
to meet for years.

569
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,700
Joe, can you put some more burgers
on the barbecue?

570
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,900
Dang.
- Two with cheese. I'll get the drinks.

571
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,600
I gotta go give him a hand.

572
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,400
George, got your clean laundry
ready for you on the way out.

573
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,410
Thanks, hon.
And thanks for saying it out loud.

574
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,310
So, what do you do, Laura?

575
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,200
I read, I smoke, I admire.

576
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,800
When you do admire,
you admire what?

577
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,555
People who write, who read.
I'm a librarian.

578
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,200
Actually, I'm reading something right now.

579
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,100
Yeah, a very engaging book.

580
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,500
Oh, what is it?

581
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,510
Barry Goldwater's
Conscience of a Conservative.

582
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,200
Jan.
- Don't tell me.

583
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,550
I worked on Gene McCarthy's
campaign. And voted for LBJ.

584
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,400
Oh, no. No.

585
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,700
Well, looks like we're hitting it off
like grease hits the skillet.

586
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,400
Well, I don't think politics
should define a human being.

587
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,900
There's more to people
than just how they vote.

588
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I like that. I like that.
You're open-minded.

589
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,000
Yeah, much more so than me,
I have to say.

590
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:10,625
Well, I just think it's important to see
all sides of a situation.

591
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,700
I read in the paper
that you're running for Congress.

592
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,100
Yes, ma'am, I am.

593
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
I don't believe in forcing myself on people.

594
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,800
So that's why I'm just gonna ask
for your phone number, not your vote.

595
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,500
Oh, well,
I couldn't vote for you, anyway.

596
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,600
I live in Austin.

597
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,300
Not that I wouldn't consider it.

598
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,300
Well, thank you for that.

599
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,800
But if you win...
- Yeah?

600
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,790
please do something for education.

601
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I was a teacher.
I believe that's the thing...

602
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,300
...that can make a difference
in people's lives.

603
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,600
Well, I'll tell you what. If I win,
you can be my education advisor.

604
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,700
Yeah, right.
- No, no, no. I'm serious.

605
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,775
I like the way you think, you know?

606
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,100
And look.

607
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
You're a devil.

608
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500
Devil in a white hat.

609
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,600
My daddy and granddaddy were farmers.

610
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,200
They didn't have anything to do
with this mess we're in.

611
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,600
Bush's daddy and granddaddy have
been in politics his whole life.

612
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,900
They don't know what
people's suffering is about.

613
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,800
George Bush here
hasn't earned the living he enjoys.

614
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,200
I stand on my own two feet,
make my own living.

615
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,400
When it comes to the integrity
of my father...

616
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,100
...what mess are you talking about?

617
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,600
Washington is the way it is...

618
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,600
...because of the Yale and Harvard
fellas running the place.

619
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,000
I went to Texas Tech,
you went to Yale.

620
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,400
I went to UT Law,
you went to Harvard.

621
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,850
I've spent half my life in Midland.
I know the problems of the people here.

622
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,600
Yeah, maybe at the country club.

623
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,000
You're still an outsider
as far as we're concerned.

624
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,500
Mr. Hance will be nothing...

625
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,000
...but a tax-and-spend errand boy
for the Democrats...

626
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,300
And he's really a carpetbagger
from Connecticut.

627
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,900
That's below the belt, even for you.
- It's God's truth.

628
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,550
Carpetbagger? This is my home. I've
been here in Midland since I was 2.

629
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:00,750
You're still an Easterner as far as we're
concerned. East don't mix with Texas.

630
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,000
My fellow Christians...

631
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,650
My fellow Christians
everywhere from Odessa to Lubbock...

632
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,800
...last week, Mr. Bush here used
some of his vast sums of money...

633
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,200
...to throw a beer bash
for underage students at Texas Tech.

634
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,400
A Bush Bash.

635
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,800
He's trying to get students to vote for him...

636
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,000
...by offering free alcohol to them.
Bribing them with booze.

637
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,300
Well, you've had a beer or two
in your lifetime.

638
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
Hell, yeah, but I'm not drinking with kids.

639
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,500
That may be the cool thing to do at Yale...

640
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,900
...but not here in good Christian country.

641
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,200
He just kept hammering away at me,
you know?

642
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,850
The same lame stuff, tarring and
feathering me about my father.

643
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:35,400
My father. What am I supposed to do?
Run as Sam Smith?

644
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:40,050
Your family name has its advantages
and its disadvantages, W.

645
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,400
Now, I'd still be with you
if you were Sam Smith.

646
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,300
There's gotta be intelligent people
that can see through him.

647
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,100
They should,
but he was so busy attacking you.

648
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:53,100
I got in some licks before he threw
the dirty tricks there at the end. Right?

649
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,500
Well...
- What, you don't agree?

650
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,600
Your mother told me never to criticize
a politician's speech.

651
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,700
Honey, look, I got a thick hide.

652
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,400
You can tell me the truth.

653
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,500
Come on.

654
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,100
What, it was all bad?

655
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,100
It wasn't good.

656
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,600
Why did you do that?

657
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,600
That was crazy.

658
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,400
I told you I can take criticism.

659
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,900
You see, I'm already over it.
- The car isn't.

660
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,100
Do not ask me for my opinion
on your speeches again.

661
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,350
Honey, look, I'm gonna be asking you
for a long, long time.

662
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,300
Not while we're driving then, please.

663
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,000
I never dated a woman quite like you,
you know that?

664
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,800
Hey, I think...

665
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,700
I think you are the gal for me.

666
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,400
Look, you're one of
the greatest listeners I've ever met.

667
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,650
And since I'm one of the biggest
talkers, it seems like a genuine fit.

668
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,750
What do you think, huh?

669
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,500
It kind of does.
- Only kind of?

670
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,000
More than kind of.
- Yeah.

671
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,050
The polls have now closed and
it looks like Democrat Kent Hance...

672
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:22,200
...has defeated Republican candidate
George W. Bush...

673
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,150
...in the race for
the 19th Congressional District.

674
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:30,050
And while Bush garnered
a respectable 47,497 votes...

675
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:34,400
...Hance swept into the lead with 53,97...

676
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,200
Well, look at it this way.

677
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,750
You came closer than any Republican
ever has in this district.

678
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,100
First is first and second is nothing.

679
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,100
At least we won here in Midland.

680
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,100
The people who know you best
voted for you.

681
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,500
I should've stuck it right back up
his butt. That's what I should've done.

682
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Geo, you wanted to play fair.

683
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,200
You didn't wanna get in the gutter.
Even though you lost...

684
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:04,250
...you can hold your head up.
- Laura, politics is not a library.

685
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:06,800
It's a kick-ass, skull-crushing war,
and I lost.

686
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,300
You'll get him next time.
- If there is a next time.

687
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,200
George.
- Look, I'll tell you one thing.

688
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:16,910
There's no way I will ever be
out-Texaned or out-Christianed again.

689
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,100
How's it going, word guys?
You gotta get cracking...

690
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,250
...on my foreign-policy speech
tomorrow. I need the draft by tonight.

691
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:04,600
You'll get it. We just have to get
our guy at the NSC to sign off on it.

692
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,250
All right. You get your guys,
you get Tenet, then I decide.

693
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:12,300
I'm going to bed after Sports Cap, so
I want it in my room by 8 p.m., latest.

694
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,400
No excuses now.
- Yes, Mr. President.

695
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,135
Come on, sit down, get writing.

696
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,600
You think we can get this stuff in?

697
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,000
If we can't,
we can always leak it to the Times.

698
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,000
All right. Let me get our guy on the horn.

699
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:29,500
Just to be safe, I wouldn't say 500,
I would say up to 500 metric tons.

700
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,300
Continue.
- 'Some ask why Iraq...

701
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,250
...is different from countries
that also have terrible weapons.

702
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,300
While there are many dangers
in this world...

703
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,300
...the threat from Iraq stands alone.'

704
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,650
I'll have to have this approved by
the agency. Let me fax it to Langley.

705
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,200
I'll get in touch with Tenet.

706
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,100
Okay.

707
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,350
George, it only takes
about 10 tons of yellow cake...

708
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:51,100
...to produce enough uranium
for a single nuclear weapon.

709
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,900
Hank, I have already gone over this...

710
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,300
...with the vice president's office and DOD.

711
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,800
This information comes from a single
foreign source.

712
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,700
It has not been confirmed.

713
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,400
Besides, Hank...

714
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,800
...it's not solid enough
to be out front with. Take it out.

715
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,100
You're sure?

716
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,240
I just can't go with it.

717
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,500
Get me Mike again.

718
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,400
Yeah?
- You have to take out the red meat...

719
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,600
...but leave all the spice you can.

720
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,400
Okay, thanks.

721
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,450
Slight change of plans. It's out.

722
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:29,290
We got a lot of work to do
before Sports Cap.

723
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,500
So, Karl, how long is this
History Channel thing gonna take?

724
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:40,635
Card scheduled it for 45 minutes.
- Come on, Spotty, this one's for you.

725
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,000
God. Spotty's getting old.

726
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,900
She needs a seeing-eye dog for herself.

727
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,100
You know,
once she was a great athlete.

728
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,900
You should have seen her.
She was like the DiMaggio of dogs.

729
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,800
So you remember your lead?
- Yup.

730
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,000
Ronald Reagan believed that
everything happened for a reason...

731
00:40:55,100 --> 00:41:00,115
...and that we should strive to know
and do the will of God.

732
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,450
Looks like your balls have been put
through the wringer, Ari. What's up?

733
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,700
Helen Thomas.
- Barney...

734
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,500
...how many times do I gotta tell you?
Stay back.

735
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,700
And what else did I write down?
- Berlin Wall.

736
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,900
Right. Cold War.

737
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,900
Reagan didn't say,
'Mr. Gorbachev...

738
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,900
...will you take down the top
three bricks off the Berlin Wall?'

739
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,900
He said, 'Tear it down. Tear it
all down.' And so they did.

740
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,600
Good boy, Barney.
- Memory's still the greatest, sir.

741
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,100
You know, I'm a lot more like him
than my father.

742
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,400
And the world has to know clearly
where America stands.

743
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,900
Yeah.

744
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,900
What's that old battle-ax,
Helen Thomas, ragging on about now?

745
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,570
Did she say anything about,
you know, Iraq?

746
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,400
She was talking about secret plans...

747
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,300
...for regime change there.
You know the rap:

748
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,900
'What makes Saddam
different from any other dictator?

749
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,100
What right do we have
to go to war with Iraq?'

750
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,300
Did you tell her I don't like mudsuckers
who gas their own people?

751
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,500
Did you tell her I don't like assholes
that try to kill my father?

752
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,300
Did you tell her that I'm gonna kick
his sorry ass all over the Mideast?

753
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,460
Well, I told her about half of that.

754
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,400
Only half?

755
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,800
Here's to turning 40 and looking 30.

756
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,100
Nothing old about you
except a few of your jokes.

757
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,200
I think my jokes are funny.

758
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:29,900
To the best thing that ever came out
of a Texas backyard barbecue.

759
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,400
May all yours and Laura's dreams
come true.

760
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,500
Each and every one of them.
- It's baseball, you know.

761
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,900
I think Bushie wants to be
baseball commissioner.

762
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,900
Why not? I love baseball.
- After all the times I've gone...

763
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,600
...I just never could get into it.

764
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,800
You know who I grew up dreaming
to be, Spider?

765
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,900
Who?
- Willie 'The Say Hey Kid' Mays.

766
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,300
He was the greatest ever.

767
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,800
The problem is you couldn't hit
the curve ball, and you're white.

768
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,300
That's right, I am white. I'm white.

769
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,565
Phone call for you, Mr. Bush.
- Whoa, Buddy Holly.

770
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,860
Who is it?
- The vice president, sir.

771
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:07,150
All right. All right, I'll get that
and it's time to get serious.

772
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:10,200
I'll see you in a while.
All right, I'll tell him you said hello.

773
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,765
You guys, I'll be right back.

774
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,600
Poppy.

775
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,100
I just wanted to wish you
a happy birthday, son.

776
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,500
Oh, thank you.
- Hope you're enjoying yourself.

777
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,700
Oh, I am, very much so.
Thank you, sir.

778
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,800
How's Laura?

779
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,400
Sweet as ever.

780
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,900
And the girls?
- They're back home in Midland.

781
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,300
We were just hoping
to get some alone time.

782
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,500
A good thing.

783
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,700
Your mother and I, we rarely get that.

784
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,500
You know, I'm gearing up to run in '88.

785
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,800
Yes, sir.
I think that's great.

786
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,640
Your brother Jeb can't get away
from Florida.

787
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,250
How'd you like to lend a hand?

788
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,200
In what way?

789
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,900
Would you be willing
to come to Washington?

790
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,040
Help me run my campaign?

791
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,300
Yes or no?

792
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,300
We'll do the... We'll do the river.

793
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,000
So, what did he have to say?

794
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,500
Well...

795
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,490
...looks like we're moving to D.C.

796
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,400
All right.

797
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,700
Hey, all right.
- Yeah.

798
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,100
All right.

799
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Come on now.

800
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,900
Good morning.

801
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,250
Well, Jan beat me 6 to 1. I'm never
gonna be any good at that game.

802
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:08,400
I think it's because I drank
almost as much as you last night.

803
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,700
You all right there?

804
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,400
Oh, I can't go on like this.

805
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,600
I'm through.
- Through what?

806
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,700
Drinking.

807
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,775
Well, everyone knows you're trying.

808
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,400
Why don't you take today off?

809
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,800
Stay in bed.

810
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,400
No. I gotta do my miles.

811
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,600
My three miles.

812
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,100
I'll suck it up.

813
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,650
You know, George, Washington
is gonna be a big change for us.

814
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,750
For the girls.

815
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:41,245
Your father is running for president.

816
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:45,650
I think it's so nice of him
to show such confidence in you.

817
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:48,200
You could not have asked for
a better birthday present.

818
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,850
Confidence? He only called me
because Jeb wasn't available.

819
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:52,900
The point is, he asked you.

820
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,845
He wants you. Bushie, why do you
do this to yourself? Why?

821
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,100
You gonna throw up?

822
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,300
Three miles.

823
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,700
You are my God and savior.

824
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,400
I always trust thee.

825
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,650
In Jesus' name, Amen.
- Amen.

826
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,800
Amen.

827
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,280
We'll see you all next week.

828
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,810
God bless you.
- Thank you.

829
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,600
You hit a dry well,
you keep on drilling.

830
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,200
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

831
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,275
Thank you very much, sir.
- Bye-bye.

832
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,500
Earle.

833
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,000
There's always this weight on me.

834
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,100
This heaviness.

835
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,250
And no matter how many times
I come here or go to church...

836
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:11,985
...that weight just won't lift.

837
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,500
W...

838
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:21,925
...the Christian life is not a constant high.

839
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,150
I got my moments of deep discontentment.

840
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:29,200
And I got to go to God, just like you,
and say, 'God, please help me.'

841
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,300
But all I am is name.

842
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,800
People say that
I was born with a silver spoon...

843
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,100
...but they don't know the burden it carries.

844
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,800
I believe you, W.

845
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,000
And that's all right.
You know, that's okay.

846
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,100
Now, look.

847
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,300
Look what you have achieved.

848
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,500
It's been, what, almost six months
that you haven't touched a drink.

849
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,600
Yes, sir.

850
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,400
Well, the good Lord sees that,
and he's proud of you.

851
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,500
We're all proud of you.

852
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,750
The worst thing you could
ever say in your life are the words:

853
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:05,400
'If only I could live it over again.' No.

854
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,675
Born again, W, that's what you are.

855
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:13,200
God has spoken to you.
We've all sinned, Lord knows.

856
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,400
But it's what you have learned that matters.

857
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,200
You hear me, George?
- Yes, sir.

858
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,900
I do. I hear you, Reverend,
I really do.

859
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,900
For God so loved the world...

860
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,900
...that he gave his only begotten son...

861
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,700
...that whosoever believeth in him...

862
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:31,750
...shall not perish
but shall have everlasting life.

863
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:34,000
John 3:16.

864
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,150
Now take the baton. Reach out.

865
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,700
And beginning today...

866
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,900
...I want you to treat everybody you meet...

867
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,850
...your friends, your enemies,
everybody...

868
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:47,400
...like they were gonna be dead at midnight.

869
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,600
Yes, sir.

870
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:52,750
You give that person
all the love that's in you, son...

871
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,900
...and do it without any thought of reward...

872
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,600
...and your life, I promise you...

873
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,420
...will never be the same again.

874
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,600
You stay with it, W,
because I can tell you...

875
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:11,600
...straight as A meets up and
mates with B, you are one of us now.

876
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:15,850
And you will never be alone now
that you're one of us, okay? Yeah?

877
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:21,500
From all walks of life,
we are a country of wounded sinners.

878
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,700
A nation, a Christian nation.

879
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:27,400
There are millions of us born again.

880
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,500
Can I ask you, Earle, to pray with me?

881
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,100
It would be my pride and joy
to pray with you, son.

882
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,200
Thank you, sir.

883
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,900
Heavenly Father...

884
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,900
...we humbly thank you
for giving our servant, George...

885
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,550
...the wisdom, the strength
and the understanding...

886
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,900
...to know the power of your ways.

887
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,700
And may he always see the light
even in his darkest days.

888
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,250
In Jesus' holy name, Amen.

889
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,350
Amen.

890
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,200
A set-up job.

891
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:11,550
Look, I'm a devout Christian.
Been one all my life.

892
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,500
No need for me to say I've been reborn.

893
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,800
No, we're not looking to put words
in your mouth, sir, far from it.

894
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,400
Only to help you
be understood by our community...

895
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,050
...who do not understand you at all.

896
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:25,200
If you say no it's gonna cost you votes.

897
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,950
And Karl knows his stuff,
and these men want you to win.

898
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:32,600
It's just a matter of coding, Poppy.
I mean...

899
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,400
It's all right, Genius Boy.
Sometimes he thinks he's me.

900
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,900
Go on, Karl.

901
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,100
Well, it's rephrasing things
so that you connect to the base.

902
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,100
I can show you this metric data,
if you like.

903
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,800
Fellas, I appreciate your support.

904
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,500
Obviously need it.

905
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,100
Trying to learn the lingo, but...

906
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,400
Still an old-school Episcopalian
you're looking at.

907
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:58,900
Junior here, I mean W,
is the real born again.

908
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:03,250
All right, gentlemen.
Thank you. Thanks a bunch.

909
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:06,100
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
- Thank you very much, sir.

910
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,580
Thank you.
- Thank you, John.

911
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,650
They all act like businessmen. They're
screamers and temple burners.

912
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:23,700
Come on. They're all protיgיs
of Billy Graham, and from Texas.

913
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,250
Look, this is a bigtime change
going on out there.

914
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:28,000
People are hungering for faith.

915
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:31,330
Your mother said you're really reborn.

916
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,900
Well, as long as you stop drinking,
you can call it what you want.

917
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,400
I'm not comfortable with this stuff.

918
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,200
Inauthentic.
Nixon did stuff like that.

919
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,700
I'm trusting you to vet everything.

920
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,900
I'm just looking for every edge, Poppy.

921
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Check this spot out.

922
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,700
Bush and Dukakis on crime.

923
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,600
Bush supports the death penalty
for first-degree murderers.

924
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,000
Dukakis not only opposes
the death penalty...

925
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:01,750
...he allowed first-degree murderers
to have weekend passes from prison.

926
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:04,400
One was Willie Horton,
who murdered a boy in a robbery...

927
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,300
...stabbing him 19 times.

928
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,900
Despite a life sentence...

929
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,650
...Horton received
10 weekend passes from prison.

930
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,900
Horton fled,
kidnapped a young couple...

931
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,400
...stabbing the man
and raping his girlfriend.

932
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:19,000
Weekend prison passes,
Dukakis on crime...

933
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,700
This guy Willie Horton
is gonna be a household name.

934
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,700
This and Dukakis in that silly helmet...

935
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,000
...sitting in the tank are gonna
put you over this time, Poppy.

936
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:30,400
Strong stuff. Naughty.

937
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,800
But you can't run
this through the campaign.

938
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,200
You've got to use another pipeline.

939
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,200
I'm ahead of you, Poppy,
don't you worry.

940
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,500
We outsourced it to
the National Security PAC.

941
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,800
Roger Ailes and his group,
they funded it.

942
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:46,300
Well, that's good work, son.
Really good.

943
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,000
Earning your spurs now.

944
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,100
Thank you, sir.

945
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,900
Here is Tom Brokaw, NBC News.

946
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,100
Good evening,
and Vice President George Bush...

947
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,500
...who's been in government housing
for 8 years...

948
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,085
...will continue to live in government...

949
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,735
George Bush is
president-elect of the United States.

950
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,400
We should send Willie Horton a fruit basket.

951
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,500
That's a good idea.

952
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,600
You look down. What is it?

953
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:32,100
Congratulations.
- Well, I'm just tired.

954
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,500
Just wondering what's
gonna happen now, Karl.

955
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,600
What do you mean?

956
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,150
My father's not gonna give me
a position, because he can't.

957
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:49,800
And I'm not gonna sit around,
become a lobbyist. That's for sure.

958
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,900
George...

959
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,650
I've been a lifelong student
of political horseflesh.

960
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:05,800
From what I see, you've got
a natural talent. Got the people touch.

961
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,900
But you need to go
out in the world, do something.

962
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,695
I don't know how else to say it,
but you haven't done jack shit yet.

963
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
George.

964
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,700
George, come on to bed.

965
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,400
Rove hit me with a 2-by-4 of truth tonight.

966
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,100
Yeah, what was that?

967
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,800
That I'll never get out of Poppy's shadow.

968
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,700
They'll all keep saying,
'What's the boy ever done?'

969
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,600
I mean, who ever remembers
the son of a president?

970
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:41,100
John Quincy Adams.

971
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:46,000
Yeah, but that was like
300 years ago, wasn't it?

972
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,800
You know what? I wish he'd lost.

973
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,900
What?

974
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,600
How can you say that?
- I don't know.

975
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:56,000
I got crazy, mixed feelings about it.
- What are you talking about?

976
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:59,550
You helped him win the presidency.
You gained his respect.

977
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:02,400
No matter what I do,
it's just never gonna be enough.

978
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,500
Okay? Never.

979
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,200
What's the bottom line, George?

980
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,600
That Baghdad has...

981
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,650
...chemical and biological weapons
currently active, no question.

982
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,600
Nukes? In some stage or other?

983
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,100
That's still problematic, sir.
We say not yet...

984
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,850
...but with moderate confidence we can
say they will have them by 2007, 2009.

985
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:25,800
But definitely this guy
has got anthrax, mustard gas...

986
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:29,300
...sarin, VX,
as much as 500 tons of CBW.

987
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,850
Given the dual-use provisions of the
U.N. sanctions, we can't prove intent.

988
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:34,000
Until he launches.

989
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,750
Their military is deteriorated,
infrastructure is shattered...

990
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:40,600
Why is British Intelligence
telling us now that this guy...

991
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:44,650
...is trying to buy up a few hundred
tons of yellow cake from Niger?

992
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:46,700
We still have no backup on that.
- We don't.

993
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:50,400
Well, we know this:

994
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:54,650
That Saddam is talking to Zarqawi,
who is talking to al Qaeda...

995
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:58,050
...and Atta met Saddam's
intel chief in Czechoslovakia.

996
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:01,000
There is no doubt that they're linked.

997
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,500
No doubt, Dick?

998
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,600
No doubt at all?

999
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,300
No doubt, Colin.

1000
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,700
What do you say, Rummy?

1001
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,750
Sir, the absence of evidence
is not the evidence of absence.

1002
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:20,800
Just because you do not have
evidence that something does exist...

1003
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,100
...does not mean you have...

1004
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,500
Can your intel say where these WMDs are?

1005
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:30,635
Well, my people think they've found
something in the area around Tikrit.

1006
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,300
But we also have leads around Baghdad.

1007
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,500
And to the areas east, west,
south, and north somewhat.

1008
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,900
Well, let's find them, Rummy.
- Indeed.

1009
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,800
We know this guy Saddam's hiding stuff.

1010
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,700
We know the U.N.'s
one big international mosh pit.

1011
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,400
We got a lot of maybes, probablys
and buts from George...

1012
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,300
...which John Q. Public ain't gonna buy.

1013
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,600
We can present better,
but we don't have nukes.

1014
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,900
What we have is a slam-dunk on the others.

1015
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Slam-dunk?

1016
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,300
What have you been drinking,
Brother George?

1017
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,400
What you need
is to bring in some lawyers...

1018
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,500
...who can argue cases with juries to help.

1019
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,500
These snapshots and Iraqi gobbledygook...

1020
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,900
...on tape is just another bunch of bullshit.

1021
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,485
Sir, you know,
whatever we come up with...

1022
00:58:14,301 --> 00:58:15,301
The old Europe.

1023
00:58:15,401 --> 00:58:17,501
Your father went to the U.N.,
Mr. President...

1024
00:58:17,601 --> 00:58:21,201
...and it took him six months, as I
remember, but he got his resolution.

1025
00:58:21,301 --> 00:58:22,501
And he got Congress too.

1026
00:58:22,601 --> 00:58:25,701
My gosh, Colin, you're the finest
military man in this room...

1027
00:58:25,801 --> 00:58:27,101
...we all know that.

1028
00:58:27,201 --> 00:58:30,501
But don't you think the Gulf War
days are long gone?

1029
00:58:30,601 --> 00:58:34,451
Do we really need six months
and half a million men...

1030
00:58:34,551 --> 00:58:37,851
...to knock off a tin-pot dictator
with a ragtag army?

1031
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,801
You're right, Don,
I am a military man.

1032
00:58:39,901 --> 00:58:43,401
And you more than anyone in this room...

1033
00:58:43,501 --> 00:58:46,401
...learned the lessons of Vietnam.

1034
00:58:48,101 --> 00:58:51,201
Now, I think we're all adults in this room...

1035
00:58:51,301 --> 00:58:56,351
...and we recognize that 9l11,
no matter how horrific it was...

1036
00:58:56,451 --> 00:58:57,501
...and it was...

1037
00:58:57,601 --> 00:59:02,616
...was also an opportunity this time
for us to get it right.

1038
00:59:03,001 --> 00:59:05,001
Drain the swamp.

1039
00:59:05,101 --> 00:59:09,951
Sweep up all the bad guys in one big move.

1040
00:59:10,051 --> 00:59:12,101
Things related and not.

1041
00:59:12,501 --> 00:59:15,391
Otherwise, sir, they will be back.

1042
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:17,401
I thought we just did that in Afghanistan.

1043
00:59:17,501 --> 00:59:19,401
We keep the focus
on sweeping up Bin Laden.

1044
00:59:19,501 --> 00:59:23,751
Goodness gracious, if you want
to call Afghanistan a war, Colin.

1045
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:26,851
You know there were no real targets
to bomb there.

1046
00:59:26,951 --> 00:59:29,801
It was an exercise.
- In any case...

1047
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:33,401
...if we don't act,
all of us will be out of here in 2004.

1048
00:59:33,501 --> 00:59:35,101
And that's the bottom line.

1049
00:59:35,201 --> 00:59:37,001
So this is all about politics, Karl?

1050
00:59:37,101 --> 00:59:39,601
I'm confused
as to what you're doing in this room.

1051
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,301
Okay, let's stay on message here.

1052
00:59:41,401 --> 00:59:44,301
Look, Genius Boy is just here
to listen, not talk.

1053
00:59:44,401 --> 00:59:46,401
You see, sir...

1054
00:59:46,901 --> 00:59:49,001
...what I'm pressing for here...

1055
00:59:49,101 --> 00:59:51,101
...is why?

1056
00:59:51,501 --> 00:59:53,501
Why are we doing this?

1057
00:59:54,101 --> 00:59:55,401
Why Iraq?

1058
00:59:55,501 --> 00:59:58,001
Why now?
- We discussed that already, Colin.

1059
00:59:58,101 --> 01:00:01,901
We had America
protected September 11 th.

1060
01:00:02,001 --> 01:00:04,751
That is, if people had been
doing their jobs right.

1061
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,701
But we blew it.

1062
01:00:06,801 --> 01:00:10,601
And now instead of taking down
these 10,000 al Qaeda lunatics...

1063
01:00:10,701 --> 01:00:13,001
...in the mountains
with special operations...

1064
01:00:13,101 --> 01:00:15,201
...we're way outside of the box
on this thing.

1065
01:00:15,301 --> 01:00:18,191
Why aren't we trusting the system?

1066
01:00:18,901 --> 01:00:20,701
Why have we veered off to this place...

1067
01:00:20,801 --> 01:00:24,301
...where we accept without debate
that a preemptive strike on Iraq...

1068
01:00:24,401 --> 01:00:26,801
...can defeat terrorism
better than police action...

1069
01:00:26,901 --> 01:00:28,901
...or intel agencies that share information?

1070
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:32,501
I just don't get it, Mr. President,
I don't. Because I am a soldier.

1071
01:00:32,601 --> 01:00:37,001
And I'd be mighty sure before
I put young American lives at risk.

1072
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:40,151
Here we are...
- Okay, Secretary Powell, come on.

1073
01:00:40,251 --> 01:00:42,701
Let me finish.

1074
01:00:45,001 --> 01:00:46,701
Here we are...

1075
01:00:46,801 --> 01:00:50,371
...changing the whole way
we do business...

1076
01:00:50,401 --> 01:00:55,051
...in response to a small but dedicated
enemy hiding out in caves and jungles.

1077
01:00:55,151 --> 01:01:00,591
Are we losing our perspective here?
- We changed our perspective.

1078
01:01:01,201 --> 01:01:03,501
The Trade Center was bombed in '93.

1079
01:01:03,601 --> 01:01:06,201
We had a huge attack on Oklahoma in '95.

1080
01:01:06,301 --> 01:01:09,401
And those who did it are in jail or dead.

1081
01:01:09,501 --> 01:01:11,001
Big difference.

1082
01:01:11,101 --> 01:01:16,501
Oklahoma terrorists
didn't have anthrax or nukes.

1083
01:01:17,001 --> 01:01:18,201
Colin...

1084
01:01:18,301 --> 01:01:21,301
...I swear, you're beginning
to sound like Neville Chamberlain.

1085
01:01:21,401 --> 01:01:23,401
Oh, don't patronize me,
Mr. Five Deferments.

1086
01:01:23,501 --> 01:01:26,201
You save that for speeches
to veterans. Neville Chamberlain.

1087
01:01:26,301 --> 01:01:27,901
You think, really...

1088
01:01:28,001 --> 01:01:31,351
You think,
with all your diplomatic bullshit...

1089
01:01:31,451 --> 01:01:37,146
...that you can appease Islamic
fascists, who are as nuts as Hitler.

1090
01:01:38,001 --> 01:01:40,601
You wanna know what I see,
Mr. President?

1091
01:01:40,701 --> 01:01:43,701
I see a world where in about 25 years...

1092
01:01:43,801 --> 01:01:46,436
...America's reserves are gone.

1093
01:01:47,301 --> 01:01:48,401
Done.

1094
01:01:48,501 --> 01:01:49,601
Demand is up...

1095
01:01:49,701 --> 01:01:51,201
...30, 40 percent.

1096
01:01:51,301 --> 01:01:56,751
And we have two oceans
blocking us from the world reserves.

1097
01:01:56,851 --> 01:02:00,166
You think we're gonna have allies then?

1098
01:02:00,301 --> 01:02:03,001
We're at 5 percent
of the world's population.

1099
01:02:03,101 --> 01:02:06,451
We use 25 percent of its energy.

1100
01:02:06,551 --> 01:02:09,201
You think Russia and China
are gonna help us out...

1101
01:02:09,301 --> 01:02:12,301
...when they need
those resources themselves?

1102
01:02:12,401 --> 01:02:16,051
Eighty percent of the world's
future energy reserves...

1103
01:02:16,151 --> 01:02:20,751
...are right here in Eurasia,
where the prize ultimately lies.

1104
01:02:20,851 --> 01:02:23,801
Oil, gas, water.

1105
01:02:24,501 --> 01:02:28,001
Iraq alone,
10 percent of the world's reserves...

1106
01:02:28,101 --> 01:02:32,351
...60 of 80 oil fields are still undeveloped.

1107
01:02:32,451 --> 01:02:35,401
And probably another 100 billion
gallons in their western desert.

1108
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:37,901
They are floating in a sea of oil.
- We have bases...

1109
01:02:38,001 --> 01:02:40,801
...in more than 120 countries
all over the world.

1110
01:02:40,901 --> 01:02:44,046
If we include Iraq,
look what happens.

1111
01:02:46,101 --> 01:02:50,301
We are at the fertile
choke point of civilization.

1112
01:02:50,401 --> 01:02:53,751
The Tigris-Euphrates,
the biblical cradle.

1113
01:02:53,851 --> 01:02:56,826
We drain this swamp, like Don says.

1114
01:02:56,901 --> 01:02:58,401
We rebuild it.

1115
01:02:58,501 --> 01:03:00,501
We develop its resources to the maximum.

1116
01:03:00,601 --> 01:03:02,601
They own it, we run it.

1117
01:03:02,601 --> 01:03:06,101
Pipelines, sea lanes, their resources
finance the reconstruction.

1118
01:03:06,201 --> 01:03:09,701
A nexus of power that won't be broken
in our lifetime.

1119
01:03:09,801 --> 01:03:12,101
If we stick to the plan.

1120
01:03:12,601 --> 01:03:16,681
So, what is our real exit strategy
on Iraq, Dick?

1121
01:03:22,401 --> 01:03:24,401
There is no exit.

1122
01:03:27,101 --> 01:03:29,101
We stay.

1123
01:03:34,701 --> 01:03:36,911
Spoken like a true oilman.

1124
01:03:37,301 --> 01:03:39,851
You were part of the plan, Colin,
back in the '90s.

1125
01:03:39,951 --> 01:03:43,201
You backed our dominance in
weaponry, space, cyber, electronic.

1126
01:03:43,301 --> 01:03:45,101
You agreed that we would never allow...

1127
01:03:45,201 --> 01:03:48,001
...another military-economic rival
to emerge against us again.

1128
01:03:48,101 --> 01:03:50,201
I don't understand...
- Turning weapons loose...

1129
01:03:50,301 --> 01:03:53,401
...on terrorists is like trying to hit
an ant with an elephant gun.

1130
01:03:53,501 --> 01:03:56,151
We invoke preemption...
Preventive war, you call it.

1131
01:03:56,251 --> 01:03:58,201
The right to use nukes whenever we see fit.

1132
01:03:58,301 --> 01:04:01,951
and I guarantee you, Paul,
we will be in a forever war everywhere.

1133
01:04:02,051 --> 01:04:04,346
Three, four wars at a time.

1134
01:04:04,401 --> 01:04:07,501
That's not new world order,
that's a world gone mad.

1135
01:04:07,601 --> 01:04:10,101
There's got to be some
global cooperation here.

1136
01:04:10,201 --> 01:04:12,901
No one's against cooperation,
Colin, you know that.

1137
01:04:13,001 --> 01:04:16,501
As long as we're calling the shots.
- Which gets us back to reality.

1138
01:04:16,601 --> 01:04:18,601
Lest we forget...

1139
01:04:19,601 --> 01:04:21,901
...where do you see
a lack of American presence?

1140
01:04:22,001 --> 01:04:23,501
Right in the heart of it all.

1141
01:04:23,601 --> 01:04:25,601
What's missing?

1142
01:04:26,701 --> 01:04:28,701
Iran.

1143
01:04:29,401 --> 01:04:30,601
The mother lode.

1144
01:04:30,701 --> 01:04:33,601
Third largest oil reserve in the world.

1145
01:04:33,701 --> 01:04:36,701
Forty percent of the world's oil...

1146
01:04:36,801 --> 01:04:40,101
...goes right through here,
the Strait of Hormuz.

1147
01:04:40,201 --> 01:04:44,281
Control Iran, control Eurasia,
control the world.

1148
01:04:45,101 --> 01:04:47,101
Empire.

1149
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:50,001
Real empire.

1150
01:04:50,701 --> 01:04:53,336
Nobody will fuck with us again.

1151
01:04:58,901 --> 01:05:02,131
It's big, Vice.
You know, big thoughts.

1152
01:05:03,601 --> 01:05:07,351
But you go out here and you
scare people when you talk like that.

1153
01:05:07,451 --> 01:05:09,901
The working Joe's not thinking about oil.

1154
01:05:10,001 --> 01:05:12,801
We're talking 9l11 terrorists...

1155
01:05:12,901 --> 01:05:14,501
...WMDs.

1156
01:05:14,601 --> 01:05:17,801
We're talking freedom and democracy.

1157
01:05:17,901 --> 01:05:20,196
We're talking Axis of Evil.

1158
01:05:20,201 --> 01:05:21,801
Sir...

1159
01:05:21,901 --> 01:05:24,701
...you have the touch, not I.

1160
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:32,301
You know,
when I was coming up...

1161
01:05:32,401 --> 01:05:34,501
...it was a dangerous world.

1162
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:37,701
But we knew exactly who the 'they' were.

1163
01:05:37,801 --> 01:05:41,951
We knew it was us versus them,
and it was clear who 'them' was.

1164
01:05:42,051 --> 01:05:43,701
Today...

1165
01:05:43,801 --> 01:05:48,101
...we're not so sure who the 'they' are,
but we know they're there.

1166
01:05:48,201 --> 01:05:50,001
Now, I'm not gonna negotiate with myself.

1167
01:05:50,101 --> 01:05:52,001
I'm a gut player, always have been.

1168
01:05:52,101 --> 01:05:54,901
And I am just so bone-tired of this Saddam.

1169
01:05:55,001 --> 01:05:57,101
He's always misunderestimated me.

1170
01:05:57,201 --> 01:05:59,701
I don't want our soldiers
invading in that desert heat.

1171
01:05:59,801 --> 01:06:02,501
We have got to get this war
going before summer, Rummy.

1172
01:06:02,601 --> 01:06:06,151
You say go now, sir, and Tommy
can start mobilizing normally.

1173
01:06:06,251 --> 01:06:08,501
We could have 300,000 troops in the Gulf...

1174
01:06:08,601 --> 01:06:11,201
...by early January without creating a stir.

1175
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:13,301
I want you to keep a tight lid on it, Rummy.

1176
01:06:13,401 --> 01:06:16,401
For the record, this is against
the spirit of the U.N. resolution.

1177
01:06:16,501 --> 01:06:19,351
We agreed with our allies
to let the inspectors do their jobs.

1178
01:06:19,451 --> 01:06:23,191
As Yogi Berra said,
'Dיjא vu all over again.'

1179
01:06:24,001 --> 01:06:26,001
Colin, you know what a burn card is?

1180
01:06:26,101 --> 01:06:27,501
No, sir.

1181
01:06:27,601 --> 01:06:30,701
Someday I gotta teach you
how to play some Texas Hold 'Em.

1182
01:06:30,801 --> 01:06:32,801
You keep selling our friends at the U. N...

1183
01:06:32,901 --> 01:06:36,551
...but whatever they say, in the end,
the final decision is mine.

1184
01:06:36,651 --> 01:06:38,201
Yes, sir.

1185
01:06:38,301 --> 01:06:42,636
Now, are you gonna be with us
on this, Colin, right?

1186
01:06:46,401 --> 01:06:48,601
I'm with you, sir.
- Good.

1187
01:06:49,201 --> 01:06:51,201
All right, gentlemen,
it's a great meeting.

1188
01:06:51,301 --> 01:06:52,301
Best yet.

1189
01:06:52,401 --> 01:06:54,401
Let's close this out.

1190
01:07:08,401 --> 01:07:10,501
Well, you've done a heck of a job, son.

1191
01:07:10,601 --> 01:07:13,321
Even though I traded Sammy Sosa?

1192
01:07:13,501 --> 01:07:15,701
We all make mistakes.

1193
01:07:16,101 --> 01:07:19,001
Center field. This is my favorite spot
in the world, Poppy.

1194
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:22,601
You know, whenever things get rough,
when I need to clear my head...

1195
01:07:22,701 --> 01:07:26,101
...I just come out here.
It just makes me feel at peace.

1196
01:07:26,201 --> 01:07:28,901
Right now,
I wish I had a spot like this.

1197
01:07:29,001 --> 01:07:31,501
Not the White House lawn.

1198
01:07:31,601 --> 01:07:34,451
This guy Saddam's really put a burr
under your saddle, I guess?

1199
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:36,801
Saddam, what I call him now.

1200
01:07:36,901 --> 01:07:39,301
If you emphasize the first syllable...

1201
01:07:39,401 --> 01:07:42,901
...it means in Arabic, 'the little boy
who shines old men's shoes.'

1202
01:07:43,001 --> 01:07:45,601
Well, he's one shoe-shining
piece of crap, all right.

1203
01:07:45,701 --> 01:07:47,701
He gassed his own people,
the Kurds...

1204
01:07:47,801 --> 01:07:49,901
...invades Kuwait.

1205
01:07:50,001 --> 01:07:52,601
It's time to back him down
and take him out, Poppy.

1206
01:07:52,701 --> 01:07:54,501
You know, like you done Noriega.

1207
01:07:54,601 --> 01:07:55,701
Well, you know...

1208
01:07:55,801 --> 01:07:59,301
...I've always believed in leaving
personal feelings out of politics...

1209
01:07:59,401 --> 01:08:02,251
...but Saddam, this can't stand.

1210
01:08:02,351 --> 01:08:04,501
I'm not gonna let that little dictator control...

1211
01:08:04,601 --> 01:08:07,501
...one quarter of the civilized world's oil.

1212
01:08:07,601 --> 01:08:09,501
I got a feeling about this.

1213
01:08:09,601 --> 01:08:11,601
How I handle it...

1214
01:08:11,701 --> 01:08:15,701
...one way or another, is gonna
determine my legacy as president.

1215
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:18,451
We don't wanna have another draw,
another Vietnam.

1216
01:08:18,551 --> 01:08:20,401
Sloppy ending.

1217
01:08:20,501 --> 01:08:23,301
It's critical I make the right call.

1218
01:08:23,401 --> 01:08:24,901
For myself.

1219
01:08:25,001 --> 01:08:26,401
For the world.

1220
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:27,701
Well, you will, Poppy.

1221
01:08:27,801 --> 01:08:28,801
I'm sure.

1222
01:08:28,901 --> 01:08:31,101
You know, just don't think about it
too much...

1223
01:08:31,201 --> 01:08:34,346
...because it just screws you all up.

1224
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:36,301
Sorry to hear about Selig screwing you.

1225
01:08:36,401 --> 01:08:37,301
No.

1226
01:08:37,401 --> 01:08:40,301
I was a dang fool thinking
he'd ever make me commissioner.

1227
01:08:40,401 --> 01:08:43,801
He was just jerking my chain,
keeping the job warm for himself.

1228
01:08:43,901 --> 01:08:45,941
You own a baseball team.

1229
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:48,381
Spare yourself the headache.

1230
01:08:49,801 --> 01:08:53,101
It may be better you stay out of the barrel.

1231
01:08:53,201 --> 01:08:55,201
What do you mean?

1232
01:08:56,201 --> 01:08:58,201
Just better.

1233
01:09:01,001 --> 01:09:02,501
So how's Jeb?

1234
01:09:02,601 --> 01:09:05,751
You know, I think your brother's
actually gonna be governor of Florida.

1235
01:09:05,851 --> 01:09:07,801
I really do.
- You don't say.

1236
01:09:07,901 --> 01:09:09,701
He's always had that ambition.

1237
01:09:09,801 --> 01:09:12,096
Oh, who knows these things.

1238
01:09:12,101 --> 01:09:13,601
But that kid could...

1239
01:09:13,701 --> 01:09:16,001
Well, one day...

1240
01:09:16,101 --> 01:09:18,651
...he could even be president.

1241
01:09:19,401 --> 01:09:21,001
Gotta be getting back.

1242
01:09:21,101 --> 01:09:22,301
Nice seeing you, son.

1243
01:09:22,401 --> 01:09:24,501
You keep it up.

1244
01:09:24,901 --> 01:09:29,236
And I'll throw out that first ball
when you need me.

1245
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:34,001
In facing down Saddam Hussein...

1246
01:09:34,101 --> 01:09:36,801
...President Bush has rewritten
the book on crisis management.

1247
01:09:36,901 --> 01:09:40,401
The temporary cease-fire
would become formal in 48 hours...

1248
01:09:40,501 --> 01:09:43,651
...if Iraq releases all POWs
and Kuwaiti detainees.

1249
01:09:43,751 --> 01:09:47,651
For all intents and purposes,
Operation Desert Storm has ended.

1250
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:49,301
A smashing victory for the Allies.

1251
01:09:49,401 --> 01:09:51,901
A crushing and embarrassing defeat
for Iraq.

1252
01:09:52,001 --> 01:09:54,101
The Iraqi POWs march
with their hands up...

1253
01:09:54,201 --> 01:09:57,951
...trudging past burning oil fields
and abandoned defensive positions.

1254
01:09:58,051 --> 01:10:00,301
Gentlemen, well done.

1255
01:10:00,401 --> 01:10:02,101
Dick, could you and Colin stay?

1256
01:10:02,201 --> 01:10:04,326
Congratulations, general.

1257
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:07,401
Good job.

1258
01:10:14,301 --> 01:10:17,201
A hundred hours, my gosh.

1259
01:10:17,601 --> 01:10:21,201
I guess we finally kicked
that Vietnam syndrome.

1260
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:23,901
It makes you wanna go all the way
to Baghdad, doesn't it?

1261
01:10:24,001 --> 01:10:26,636
Probably get there in two days.

1262
01:10:27,201 --> 01:10:30,601
But to be an occupying power
in an Arab land...

1263
01:10:30,701 --> 01:10:32,701
...the coalition would fall apart.

1264
01:10:32,801 --> 01:10:36,201
We'd be out there all alone.
Mission creep.

1265
01:10:36,301 --> 01:10:39,901
Going after Saddam,
we'd turn him into a hero.

1266
01:10:40,001 --> 01:10:41,501
That's not our job.

1267
01:10:41,601 --> 01:10:44,601
And how many Americans is Iraq worth?

1268
01:10:44,701 --> 01:10:47,421
You got an election in November.

1269
01:10:48,201 --> 01:10:49,901
No.

1270
01:10:50,001 --> 01:10:52,001
Gone far enough.

1271
01:10:52,901 --> 01:10:54,901
Nice job, fellas.

1272
01:10:54,901 --> 01:10:57,201
Cleanest war in history.

1273
01:10:57,401 --> 01:10:59,401
Proud of you.

1274
01:10:59,801 --> 01:11:03,371
This is the proudest day of my presidency.

1275
01:11:09,501 --> 01:11:11,901
Governor Clinton
is now President-Elect Bill Clinton.

1276
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:13,901
He has won this presidential race...

1277
01:11:14,001 --> 01:11:16,101
...along with his running mate,
Senator Al Gore.

1278
01:11:16,201 --> 01:11:18,601
In spite of his overwhelming victory
in Iraq...

1279
01:11:18,701 --> 01:11:21,651
...the people did not return
George Bush to the White House.

1280
01:11:21,751 --> 01:11:25,101
A stunning reversal of fortune
for an aristocrat of politics...

1281
01:11:25,201 --> 01:11:28,101
...whose long career was
overshadowed by a bad economy...

1282
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:32,151
...a third-party candidate, Ross Perot,
and a secret war in Nicaragua.

1283
01:11:32,251 --> 01:11:35,736
All of which may have combined to undo...

1284
01:11:36,901 --> 01:11:40,001
The best person didn't win tonight.

1285
01:11:40,401 --> 01:11:43,701
The best man did not win, George.

1286
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:47,701
He's so beneath you.

1287
01:11:47,801 --> 01:11:50,101
He doesn't deserve to be president.

1288
01:11:50,201 --> 01:11:53,701
And he wouldn't be
if it wasn't for the damn media.

1289
01:11:53,801 --> 01:11:55,901
You were a great president, Poppy.

1290
01:11:56,001 --> 01:11:58,001
Great president.

1291
01:12:00,901 --> 01:12:03,201
I gave it all I could.

1292
01:12:06,301 --> 01:12:09,701
I thought the war would have carried us.

1293
01:12:19,901 --> 01:12:21,901
Well...

1294
01:12:21,901 --> 01:12:26,201
...if you just would've clobbered
the son of a bitch, you know?

1295
01:12:26,301 --> 01:12:27,601
What?
- You know, I mean...

1296
01:12:27,701 --> 01:12:31,866
...gone all the way to Baghdad.
Cleaned his clock.

1297
01:12:33,101 --> 01:12:34,901
Has he been imbibing something I don't...?

1298
01:12:35,001 --> 01:12:38,001
Don't start. Don't start that.
I'm talking about decisiveness.

1299
01:12:38,101 --> 01:12:39,701
Finishing.
Everything I've been told.

1300
01:12:39,801 --> 01:12:43,351
Okay, that's it. You can stop right now.
Just zip it up, and I mean it.

1301
01:12:43,451 --> 01:12:44,601
I won that war.

1302
01:12:44,701 --> 01:12:46,826
Of course you did, Poppy.

1303
01:12:47,301 --> 01:12:49,301
Of course you did.

1304
01:12:50,401 --> 01:12:52,901
Can you all leave, please,
for a moment? Thank you.

1305
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:58,051
and this is the first indication
of jubilation in Little Rock, Arkansas.

1306
01:12:58,151 --> 01:13:00,001
What was that about?
- Damned if I know.

1307
01:13:00,101 --> 01:13:02,801
I've never seen him like this before.

1308
01:13:02,901 --> 01:13:05,401
Well, it's hard, you know?
He knows this is the end.

1309
01:13:05,501 --> 01:13:09,101
You know what? If he would've listened
to me, he'd have pulverized Clinton.

1310
01:13:09,201 --> 01:13:12,601
I mean, I wish he had more of Mom
in him because he's weak in spirit.

1311
01:13:12,701 --> 01:13:15,601
That's the difference maker.
He doesn't believe like I believe.

1312
01:13:15,701 --> 01:13:17,101
That is not what this is about.

1313
01:13:17,201 --> 01:13:19,601
It's his health,
all the medications he's taking.

1314
01:13:19,701 --> 01:13:22,001
He's just tired, and he's old.

1315
01:13:22,101 --> 01:13:23,601
I can't watch him like this.

1316
01:13:23,701 --> 01:13:26,401
You know, it hurts too damn much to lose.

1317
01:13:26,501 --> 01:13:29,731
I'd never let this happen to me.
Never.

1318
01:13:38,901 --> 01:13:40,901
Governor of Texas?

1319
01:13:40,901 --> 01:13:42,901
You must be joking.

1320
01:13:43,501 --> 01:13:44,701
No, I'm dead serious.

1321
01:13:44,801 --> 01:13:47,901
Well, how are you gonna beat
Ann Richards? She's way too popular.

1322
01:13:48,001 --> 01:13:50,401
Look, Ann Richards
is way too liberal for Texas.

1323
01:13:50,501 --> 01:13:52,701
Karl's done the polls.
He says I can beat her.

1324
01:13:52,801 --> 01:13:54,701
I'm gonna make Miss Big-Mouth-Big-Hair...

1325
01:13:54,801 --> 01:13:56,901
...pay for the things she said about Poppy.

1326
01:13:57,001 --> 01:13:58,601
Leave it alone.

1327
01:13:58,701 --> 01:14:00,401
Besides, I won that campaign.

1328
01:14:00,501 --> 01:14:03,101
What's at issue...?
This isn't fair to Jeb.

1329
01:14:03,201 --> 01:14:05,501
He's already running
for governor of Florida.

1330
01:14:05,601 --> 01:14:08,501
One Bush at a time, son.
- I'm not looking to steal his heat.

1331
01:14:08,601 --> 01:14:11,501
How do you expect us to go
campaigning for both of you?

1332
01:14:11,601 --> 01:14:14,201
I'm not asking you to.

1333
01:14:14,301 --> 01:14:16,951
Laura, how do you feel
about all of this, truthfully?

1334
01:14:17,051 --> 01:14:18,401
W knows how I feel.

1335
01:14:18,501 --> 01:14:21,401
Look, you don't understand.
I've already made up my mind.

1336
01:14:21,501 --> 01:14:24,951
So you're not asking us,
you're telling us.

1337
01:14:25,051 --> 01:14:27,346
The fact is, you can't win.

1338
01:14:27,401 --> 01:14:29,401
Why do you say that?

1339
01:14:29,401 --> 01:14:31,501
Because you're too much like me.

1340
01:14:31,601 --> 01:14:34,101
You're loud and you got a short fuse.

1341
01:14:34,201 --> 01:14:36,801
Now, Jeb is like your father.

1342
01:14:36,901 --> 01:14:38,401
He thinks before he speaks.

1343
01:14:38,501 --> 01:14:40,401
He's got his feet on the ground.

1344
01:14:40,501 --> 01:14:44,901
Barb, don't be so hard on him.
- Well, he knows it's the truth.

1345
01:14:45,001 --> 01:14:47,501
I'm not gonna say something
I'm liable to regret here.

1346
01:14:47,601 --> 01:14:52,051
Son, just consider holding off until '98.

1347
01:14:52,151 --> 01:14:54,201
You won't have Richards to contend with.

1348
01:14:54,301 --> 01:14:56,601
We'll be able to give you
our undivided support.

1349
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:58,101
No, no, I get it. I get it.

1350
01:14:58,201 --> 01:15:00,301
You want Jeb to get elected before me.

1351
01:15:00,401 --> 01:15:04,651
Come off it.
It's a matter of practicality, of timing.

1352
01:15:04,751 --> 01:15:09,426
I want you both to have
what you want, what you deserve.

1353
01:15:09,601 --> 01:15:13,151
Well, I'm running this time, Poppy.

1354
01:15:13,251 --> 01:15:14,901
You hear me?

1355
01:15:15,001 --> 01:15:16,301
I'm running now.

1356
01:15:16,401 --> 01:15:19,601
Here they come.
They'll be bringing the heat.

1357
01:15:19,701 --> 01:15:21,101
I know, don't swing at anything I can't hit.

1358
01:15:21,201 --> 01:15:23,301
Mr. Bush, you didn't talk much
about education.

1359
01:15:23,401 --> 01:15:24,901
What are your plans for reform?

1360
01:15:25,001 --> 01:15:27,201
Well, I'm gonna deregulate
school districts...

1361
01:15:27,301 --> 01:15:29,201
...so that teachers and administrators...

1362
01:15:29,301 --> 01:15:31,601
...can develop programs
that best fit their kids.

1363
01:15:31,701 --> 01:15:34,251
How are you proposing
to measure students' progress?

1364
01:15:34,351 --> 01:15:38,851
Well, we need to make a wholesale
effort against racial profiling...

1365
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,401
...which is illiterate children.

1366
01:15:40,501 --> 01:15:42,201
You need to teach a child to read...

1367
01:15:42,301 --> 01:15:44,801
...then he or her will be able
to pass a literacy test.

1368
01:15:44,901 --> 01:15:47,501
We're in the very early stages
of developing our program.

1369
01:15:47,601 --> 01:15:50,201
How do you plan
to change the school finance formula?

1370
01:15:50,301 --> 01:15:52,951
I for one will not stand
for the subsidation of failure.

1371
01:15:53,051 --> 01:15:54,901
How do you know
if you don't measure up...

1372
01:15:55,001 --> 01:15:57,551
...if you have a system
that simply suckles them through?

1373
01:15:57,651 --> 01:15:59,101
What about our failed schools?

1374
01:15:59,201 --> 01:16:02,651
Think the state needs to take over?
- More government's not the answer.

1375
01:16:02,751 --> 01:16:05,201
We must have the attitude
that every child in America...

1376
01:16:05,301 --> 01:16:07,801
...regardless of where they're raised,
can learn.

1377
01:16:07,901 --> 01:16:10,201
You know,
rarely is the question asked:

1378
01:16:10,301 --> 01:16:12,201
'Is our children learning?'

1379
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:15,301
Okay, fellas, that's it. We'll see you
at the next campaign stop.

1380
01:16:15,401 --> 01:16:18,951
Mr. Bush. Mr. Bush. Mr. Bush.
- No more. Adiףs. Adiףs. Adiףs.

1381
01:16:19,051 --> 01:16:20,801
'Suckles'?

1382
01:16:20,901 --> 01:16:22,701
Look, you're the son of a president.

1383
01:16:22,801 --> 01:16:24,401
You graduated Yale.

1384
01:16:24,501 --> 01:16:26,701
You went to Harvard,
got a business degree.

1385
01:16:26,801 --> 01:16:29,901
If you can't stand in front of those guys
for two minutes...

1386
01:16:30,001 --> 01:16:32,501
...and come up with one plausible answer...

1387
01:16:32,601 --> 01:16:34,951
...then what the hell
are we running for governor for?

1388
01:16:35,051 --> 01:16:37,601
Just tell me what to do.
Whatever it takes.

1389
01:16:37,701 --> 01:16:41,001
Look, if I need to read the
whole damn Constitution, I'll learn it.

1390
01:16:41,101 --> 01:16:43,601
Okay, four food groups.

1391
01:16:43,701 --> 01:16:46,001
Crime, education,
tort reform, welfare.

1392
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:48,901
And if they ask you what time of day
it is, what do you say?

1393
01:16:49,001 --> 01:16:50,601
We must teach our children to read.

1394
01:16:50,701 --> 01:16:51,701
What about welfare?

1395
01:16:51,801 --> 01:16:54,501
We must hold the fathers
and the unwed mothers accountable.

1396
01:16:54,601 --> 01:16:56,801
Because we love babies.
- Because we love babies.

1397
01:16:56,901 --> 01:16:58,501
Crime?

1398
01:16:58,601 --> 01:17:02,001
End early release and all paroles
for rapists and child molesters.

1399
01:17:02,101 --> 01:17:05,701
Citizens got the right to carry
a handgun for self-protection.

1400
01:17:05,801 --> 01:17:08,501
My opponent disagrees about that.

1401
01:17:08,601 --> 01:17:11,501
But Texas got the highest rate
of murders in the country.

1402
01:17:11,601 --> 01:17:14,001
And still Miss Richards' hair
is in the clouds.

1403
01:17:14,101 --> 01:17:16,801
She doesn't believe the citizens
got to protect themselves.

1404
01:17:16,901 --> 01:17:18,801
If you believe that,
vote for my opponent.

1405
01:17:18,901 --> 01:17:21,201
Okay, so, what about
that swagger of yours?

1406
01:17:21,301 --> 01:17:24,951
In Texas, we call that walking.
- Drinking, drugs, your past?

1407
01:17:25,051 --> 01:17:28,201
It was a mistake. I was young.
That's all I'm gonna say about that.

1408
01:17:28,301 --> 01:17:31,101
I don't wanna give your
14-year-old child the excuse to say:

1409
01:17:31,201 --> 01:17:33,651
'If old Governor Bush done it,
maybe I can do it too.'

1410
01:17:33,751 --> 01:17:35,501
Hey, George.
- Hey, girls. How are you?

1411
01:17:35,601 --> 01:17:37,701
Good luck on your campaign.
- Thank you.

1412
01:17:37,801 --> 01:17:39,601
Hope you win.
- Vote for me, don't forget.

1413
01:17:39,701 --> 01:17:40,701
Yes, sir.

1414
01:17:40,801 --> 01:17:44,301
What do you say to, 'George W. Bush
is a rich, spoiled jerk.

1415
01:17:44,401 --> 01:17:46,301
His wealth was produced by stock swaps...

1416
01:17:46,401 --> 01:17:48,601
...and bailouts arranged by his daddy'?

1417
01:17:48,701 --> 01:17:50,601
Ann Richards can badmouth me
all she wants.

1418
01:17:50,701 --> 01:17:52,601
I've created successful small businesses.

1419
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:54,401
I run a Major League baseball team.

1420
01:17:54,501 --> 01:17:57,451
I'm in touch with real people in Texas.

1421
01:17:57,551 --> 01:17:59,601
I work with them every day at the ball park.

1422
01:17:59,701 --> 01:18:03,801
Talk to the fans, hot dog vendors.
Get to know what they think.

1423
01:18:03,901 --> 01:18:06,351
Because truly, deep down inside...

1424
01:18:06,451 --> 01:18:08,801
...you know I'm a guy like you,
a guy you can trust.

1425
01:18:08,901 --> 01:18:11,101
Fabulous. Fabulous, W.

1426
01:18:11,201 --> 01:18:12,801
What it all comes down to...

1427
01:18:12,901 --> 01:18:16,251
...is who Joe Voter wants to sit down
and have a beer with.

1428
01:18:16,351 --> 01:18:17,701
And guess who that is.

1429
01:18:17,801 --> 01:18:19,701
Just remember to make mine nonalcoholic.

1430
01:18:19,801 --> 01:18:22,601
So anything about the issues,
you come to me first.

1431
01:18:22,701 --> 01:18:24,401
I'll tell you what to say.

1432
01:18:24,501 --> 01:18:26,501
You're not gonna tell me what to say, Karl.

1433
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:29,001
I'm gonna tell you what I want.
You're the word man.

1434
01:18:29,101 --> 01:18:31,201
This campaign starts and ends with me.

1435
01:18:31,301 --> 01:18:34,201
You got it, W. I'm just a little fairy...

1436
01:18:34,301 --> 01:18:37,601
...putting down a little magic dust for you.

1437
01:18:37,701 --> 01:18:39,401
And, Karl...

1438
01:18:39,501 --> 01:18:42,816
...this time I'm gonna out-Texas Texas.

1439
01:18:46,501 --> 01:18:49,301
Your father's here to see you,
governor.

1440
01:18:49,401 --> 01:18:51,101
Poppy's here right now?

1441
01:18:51,201 --> 01:18:53,101
All right, send him in, Evie.
- Governor.

1442
01:18:53,201 --> 01:18:54,901
Yeah. You like that, don't you?

1443
01:18:55,001 --> 01:18:57,001
Put your pants on.

1444
01:18:58,401 --> 01:19:01,546
How are you, son?
- Hey, Poppy, sorry.

1445
01:19:02,101 --> 01:19:03,101
Got your speech ready?

1446
01:19:03,201 --> 01:19:05,601
Yeah, I was just getting ready
to go over it again.

1447
01:19:05,701 --> 01:19:07,901
This is a moment you'll never forget...

1448
01:19:08,001 --> 01:19:10,201
...being inaugurated for the first time.

1449
01:19:10,301 --> 01:19:13,101
Try and take a photograph in your mind...

1450
01:19:13,201 --> 01:19:16,651
...so you can savor it
when the times get tough...

1451
01:19:16,751 --> 01:19:18,801
...as they always do.

1452
01:19:19,201 --> 01:19:22,431
All right, well, I'll try and do that.

1453
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:26,101
Yeah, I sure am glad that Jeb's coming.

1454
01:19:26,201 --> 01:19:29,516
I'm gonna acknowledge him in my speech.

1455
01:19:30,601 --> 01:19:34,001
It's been hard on him,
the loss.

1456
01:19:34,301 --> 01:19:37,601
I wish I could've been
at his inauguration too.

1457
01:19:37,701 --> 01:19:39,101
It would've been something.

1458
01:19:39,201 --> 01:19:42,176
Why do you just feel bad about Jeb?

1459
01:19:43,501 --> 01:19:46,306
Why don't you feel good about me?

1460
01:19:46,401 --> 01:19:49,001
Well, of course I do.

1461
01:19:49,101 --> 01:19:51,101
And...

1462
01:19:56,201 --> 01:19:58,201
I brought you these.

1463
01:20:00,501 --> 01:20:02,966
They were your grandfather's.

1464
01:20:03,601 --> 01:20:06,661
The only real thing he ever gave me.

1465
01:20:10,401 --> 01:20:12,401
Wear them well.

1466
01:20:18,801 --> 01:20:21,606
See you at the inauguration, son.

1467
01:20:26,701 --> 01:20:29,251
Well, what did he have to say?

1468
01:20:32,501 --> 01:20:35,901
'These cufflinks
are my most treasured possession.

1469
01:20:36,001 --> 01:20:40,751
My father, Prescott, gave them to me
right after I came back from the war.

1470
01:20:40,851 --> 01:20:42,501
They were mine.
Now they are yours.

1471
01:20:42,601 --> 01:20:44,701
I'm sure you will make a fine governor.'

1472
01:20:44,801 --> 01:20:46,801
It's nice, W.

1473
01:20:46,901 --> 01:20:49,901
You think he might ever be able
to say something direct to me...

1474
01:20:50,001 --> 01:20:52,301
...instead of using these notes?
- This is his way.

1475
01:20:52,401 --> 01:20:55,651
You think he might be happy with me?
- Hon, he is.

1476
01:20:55,751 --> 01:20:57,751
Let me help you.

1477
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:07,036
Well, Jebby, that's just great.

1478
01:21:07,201 --> 01:21:09,701
Keep Florida warm. You say hi
to Columba and the kids for me.

1479
01:21:09,801 --> 01:21:11,801
Governor, the reverend.

1480
01:21:12,001 --> 01:21:13,801
Yeah, we'll talk later.

1481
01:21:13,901 --> 01:21:15,101
Earle.
- Governor.

1482
01:21:15,201 --> 01:21:17,001
Hey, thanks a bunch for coming.
- Yeah.

1483
01:21:17,101 --> 01:21:20,501
Hey, go ahead, take a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

1484
01:21:20,601 --> 01:21:23,051
Hey, how's the show coming along?
- Couldn't be better.

1485
01:21:23,151 --> 01:21:26,901
Over 100 million Americans
are watching the Earle Hudd Hour...

1486
01:21:27,001 --> 01:21:29,301
...right here in North America.
- Fabulous.

1487
01:21:29,401 --> 01:21:33,481
You don't say. That's great.
That's dandy, Earle.

1488
01:21:33,701 --> 01:21:36,001
So, listen...

1489
01:21:36,101 --> 01:21:41,711
...I asked you here today to discuss
something of great importance.

1490
01:21:42,801 --> 01:21:44,301
I've heard the call.

1491
01:21:44,401 --> 01:21:45,601
Well, I know.

1492
01:21:45,701 --> 01:21:48,601
Don't forget, I've been the witness
to the growth in your faith.

1493
01:21:48,701 --> 01:21:51,001
No, that's not what I mean.

1494
01:21:51,101 --> 01:21:52,901
I mean, I've heard the call.

1495
01:21:53,001 --> 01:21:57,421
And I believe that God
wants me to run for president.

1496
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:04,796
Truly?
- I can't explain it.

1497
01:22:04,801 --> 01:22:07,001
But I think that something is gonna happen.

1498
01:22:07,101 --> 01:22:09,901
And at that time,
my country is gonna need me.

1499
01:22:10,001 --> 01:22:13,201
And, you know,
I think it's part of a divine plan.

1500
01:22:13,301 --> 01:22:16,501
Well, a man don't hear the call, governor...

1501
01:22:16,601 --> 01:22:18,701
...unless the good Lord wants him to.

1502
01:22:18,801 --> 01:22:20,501
The truth is I don't wanna run.

1503
01:22:20,601 --> 01:22:23,701
I mean, it's like Moses. I mean,
he wasn't a very good speaker.

1504
01:22:23,801 --> 01:22:26,201
But finally, he just knew.

1505
01:22:26,301 --> 01:22:29,551
My father was president,
the whole family was affected by it.

1506
01:22:29,651 --> 01:22:31,501
I know the price.

1507
01:22:31,601 --> 01:22:34,901
I'd be happy just buying
my fishing lures at Wal-Mart.

1508
01:22:35,001 --> 01:22:38,751
And if I run for president,
I know my life will never be the same.

1509
01:22:38,851 --> 01:22:42,101
But I feel
that God wants me to do this, Earle.

1510
01:22:42,201 --> 01:22:44,201
And I must do it.

1511
01:22:44,601 --> 01:22:46,601
I must.

1512
01:22:49,701 --> 01:22:51,911
Well, then, you must, son.

1513
01:22:52,601 --> 01:22:56,256
I'd like to pray over it.
- Yeah, thank you.

1514
01:22:57,901 --> 01:22:59,901
Dear Lord...

1515
01:23:00,001 --> 01:23:02,401
...we pray that you will watch over...

1516
01:23:02,501 --> 01:23:08,051
...and always shine your light on
our humble servant George W. Bush.

1517
01:23:08,151 --> 01:23:10,001
In Jesus' name.

1518
01:23:10,101 --> 01:23:11,701
Amen.

1519
01:23:11,801 --> 01:23:13,801
Amen.

1520
01:23:17,101 --> 01:23:19,101
Last draft. I promise.

1521
01:23:20,601 --> 01:23:23,401
Yellowcake again.
I've read how many of these?

1522
01:23:23,501 --> 01:23:29,536
I'm burned out. I've gotta get some
sack time. Have my guy check it out.

1523
01:23:33,401 --> 01:23:35,501
We finally got it in.

1524
01:23:35,601 --> 01:23:38,001
Page eight. Uranium in Africa.

1525
01:23:38,101 --> 01:23:39,601
Took long enough.

1526
01:23:39,701 --> 01:23:43,001
British Government has learned
that Saddam Hussein...

1527
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:48,201
...recently sought significant quantities
of uranium in Africa.

1528
01:23:48,301 --> 01:23:50,301
Our intelligence sources tells us...

1529
01:23:50,401 --> 01:23:53,801
...that he has attempted to purchase
high-strength aluminum tubes...

1530
01:23:53,901 --> 01:23:56,901
...suitable for nuclear-weapons production.

1531
01:23:57,001 --> 01:23:59,301
Evidence from intelligence sources...

1532
01:23:59,401 --> 01:24:02,901
...and secret communications
from people now in custody...

1533
01:24:03,001 --> 01:24:05,201
...reveal that Saddam Hussein...

1534
01:24:05,301 --> 01:24:07,701
...aids and protects terrorists.

1535
01:24:07,801 --> 01:24:10,601
Including members of al Qaeda.

1536
01:24:11,601 --> 01:24:14,066
Imagine those 19 hijackers...

1537
01:24:14,101 --> 01:24:17,101
...with other weapons and other plans...

1538
01:24:17,201 --> 01:24:20,346
...this time armed by Saddam Hussein.

1539
01:24:20,601 --> 01:24:23,831
It would take one bomb,
one canister...

1540
01:24:23,851 --> 01:24:26,601
...one crate slipped into this country...

1541
01:24:26,701 --> 01:24:30,451
...to bring a day of horror
like none we have ever known.

1542
01:24:30,551 --> 01:24:33,701
Facing clear evidence of peril...

1543
01:24:34,101 --> 01:24:37,101
...we cannot wait for the final proof...

1544
01:24:37,201 --> 01:24:42,641
...the smoking gun that can come
in the form of a mushroom cloud.

1545
01:24:43,801 --> 01:24:47,901
The liberty we prize
is not America's gift to the world.

1546
01:24:48,001 --> 01:24:50,701
It is God's gift to humanity.

1547
01:25:00,801 --> 01:25:05,351
Every nation and every region
has a decision to make.

1548
01:25:05,451 --> 01:25:09,786
Either you're with us
or you're with the terrorists.

1549
01:25:21,601 --> 01:25:23,401
May he guide us now.

1550
01:25:23,501 --> 01:25:28,431
And may God continue to bless
the United States of America.

1551
01:26:08,201 --> 01:26:11,101
Why don't you take your sleeping pill?

1552
01:26:11,201 --> 01:26:13,201
Clouds coming in.

1553
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:15,201
Looks like rain.

1554
01:26:15,401 --> 01:26:17,201
Come on.

1555
01:26:17,301 --> 01:26:22,301
You're not sitting here at 3 a.m.
thinking about the weather.

1556
01:26:22,401 --> 01:26:24,601
Remind me to call the electrician
in the morning.

1557
01:26:24,701 --> 01:26:26,501
There's a light out on the path below.

1558
01:26:26,601 --> 01:26:29,801
Why don't you call your son
and tell him what's on your mind...

1559
01:26:29,901 --> 01:26:31,701
...what's keeping you awake all night?

1560
01:26:31,801 --> 01:26:33,801
I'm worried about him.

1561
01:26:35,501 --> 01:26:37,501
Really worried.

1562
01:26:39,001 --> 01:26:41,301
I can't talk to him.

1563
01:26:41,801 --> 01:26:44,301
Well, he's not gonna listen to me.

1564
01:26:44,401 --> 01:26:47,801
He takes criticism worse than I do.

1565
01:26:48,001 --> 01:26:50,101
He's the president now.

1566
01:26:50,201 --> 01:26:52,401
His decision to make.

1567
01:26:52,901 --> 01:26:54,601
Well...

1568
01:26:54,701 --> 01:26:56,201
...you better do something.

1569
01:26:56,301 --> 01:26:58,901
This is eating away at you.

1570
01:27:01,701 --> 01:27:03,701
I'll do something.

1571
01:27:04,401 --> 01:27:06,001
'An attack on Iraq at this time...

1572
01:27:06,101 --> 01:27:09,201
...would seriously jeopardize
the global counter terrorist campaign...

1573
01:27:09,301 --> 01:27:11,201
...we have undertaken.
And would result...

1574
01:27:11,301 --> 01:27:14,351
...in a serious degradation
in international cooperation with us...

1575
01:27:14,451 --> 01:27:16,451
...against terrorism.'

1576
01:27:19,101 --> 01:27:20,901
Damn Brent Scowcroft.

1577
01:27:21,001 --> 01:27:23,501
He wouldn't be doing this
unless my father approved it.

1578
01:27:23,601 --> 01:27:25,401
You know, Poppy's good friend.

1579
01:27:25,501 --> 01:27:27,601
These 1980 guys trying to
tell me what to do...

1580
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:29,401
...when they don't know what I know.

1581
01:27:29,501 --> 01:27:31,901
Just when we want the U.N.
and the Democrats in this.

1582
01:27:32,001 --> 01:27:34,381
I will call Brent right now.

1583
01:27:34,401 --> 01:27:36,401
He can't even talk to me directly like a man.

1584
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:39,201
Writing letters. I don't wanna
get anything like this again.

1585
01:27:39,301 --> 01:27:42,851
I will let Brent know that from here
on out, he's persona non grata.

1586
01:27:42,951 --> 01:27:44,401
This is my war, not his.

1587
01:27:44,501 --> 01:27:46,881
I will not renegotiate this.

1588
01:27:46,901 --> 01:27:48,701
Mr. President.

1589
01:27:48,801 --> 01:27:53,051
Has your father ever personally
offered you advice on Iraq?

1590
01:27:53,151 --> 01:27:55,301
No, I haven't asked. I don't need to.

1591
01:27:55,401 --> 01:27:57,501
Wrong father to appeal to
in terms of strength.

1592
01:27:57,601 --> 01:28:00,201
You know, there's a higher father
I appeal to.

1593
01:28:00,301 --> 01:28:02,301
Amen.

1594
01:28:04,801 --> 01:28:06,501
Protestors came by the thousands...

1595
01:28:06,601 --> 01:28:11,701
...filling block after block around
the United Nations to make a single...

1596
01:28:11,801 --> 01:28:17,411
These are the largest anti-war
demonstrations ever seen in history.

1597
01:28:19,101 --> 01:28:22,951
Some of our allies were very much
against this operation.

1598
01:28:23,051 --> 01:28:24,601
Bush, Bush.

1599
01:28:24,701 --> 01:28:28,451
Estimates of 10 to 15 million
protestors across the planet...

1600
01:28:28,551 --> 01:28:32,631
...protesting America's
pro-war policies in Iraq.

1601
01:28:33,601 --> 01:28:38,021
Tens of thousands demonstrating
all over the world...

1602
01:28:39,701 --> 01:28:42,801
So I suppose the key here,
George, is to go back to the U.N.

1603
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:46,451
Tony, I'm with you, but I'm flat out of
wrestling moves with these U.N. types.

1604
01:28:46,551 --> 01:28:48,601
Even Powell doesn't think
we can get it through.

1605
01:28:48,701 --> 01:28:51,301
Believe me, I am twisting
my own set of arms at the U.N.

1606
01:28:51,401 --> 01:28:54,001
All right.
- But I still think...

1607
01:28:54,101 --> 01:28:58,251
...France, Germany, Russia,
we can make a deal.

1608
01:28:58,351 --> 01:29:00,501
Well, our new thinking is shaping on that.

1609
01:29:00,601 --> 01:29:02,201
Yeah.
- Which is?

1610
01:29:02,301 --> 01:29:04,601
Punish France.
Ignore Germany.

1611
01:29:04,701 --> 01:29:06,401
Forgive Russia.

1612
01:29:06,501 --> 01:29:10,751
Yes, but with time, just a few months,
much will become clearer.

1613
01:29:10,851 --> 01:29:12,201
No, we can't do that, Tony.

1614
01:29:12,301 --> 01:29:15,601
We run out of time. The start date
for the war is penciled in. March 10.

1615
01:29:15,701 --> 01:29:17,001
March 10th.

1616
01:29:17,101 --> 01:29:20,701
George, the inspectors
haven't found anything yet.

1617
01:29:20,801 --> 01:29:22,501
How can we justify a preemptive attack?

1618
01:29:22,601 --> 01:29:25,401
Well, no WMDs yet, Tony,
but we know they got them.

1619
01:29:25,501 --> 01:29:27,801
Absolutely.
- So it just might come down to us...

1620
01:29:27,901 --> 01:29:30,251
...having to provoke the son of a bitch.

1621
01:29:30,351 --> 01:29:31,801
Well, what do you have in mind?

1622
01:29:31,901 --> 01:29:35,451
We were thinking of painting one of
our U-2 recon planes in U.N. colors...

1623
01:29:35,551 --> 01:29:36,701
...and fly it over Iraq.

1624
01:29:36,801 --> 01:29:40,501
Now, if Saddam takes the bait,
which, knowing him, he will...

1625
01:29:40,601 --> 01:29:43,501
Well, when he fires on it,
he'll be in breach of 1441.

1626
01:29:43,601 --> 01:29:46,501
That would sure justify retaliation.

1627
01:29:46,601 --> 01:29:48,401
Well, it's a novel idea.

1628
01:29:48,501 --> 01:29:50,301
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

1629
01:29:50,401 --> 01:29:51,501
Tony...

1630
01:29:51,601 --> 01:29:54,701
...come the U.N.
second resolution or not...

1631
01:29:54,801 --> 01:29:56,901
...we're going to war on this.

1632
01:29:57,001 --> 01:29:59,001
Are you?

1633
01:30:05,801 --> 01:30:09,301
I do not share your spirit
for why we need war.

1634
01:30:09,401 --> 01:30:11,001
War is not inevitable.

1635
01:30:11,101 --> 01:30:14,951
There are alternative ways to reach goals.

1636
01:30:15,051 --> 01:30:17,701
I mean, it's a question of morality,
George.

1637
01:30:17,801 --> 01:30:20,501
Well, Jacques,
St. Augustine wrote about that.

1638
01:30:20,601 --> 01:30:24,001
Said there was such a thing as just war.

1639
01:30:26,201 --> 01:30:28,701
Listen, Jacques,
I'm committed to our relationship.

1640
01:30:28,801 --> 01:30:30,301
So am I.
- I'm responsible for...

1641
01:30:30,401 --> 01:30:33,301
...hugging the families of those
who have lost lives in war...

1642
01:30:33,401 --> 01:30:36,651
...and I view an armed Saddam as
a direct threat to the American people.

1643
01:30:36,751 --> 01:30:42,701
Well, if there is a war, we'll work
together on the reconstruction.

1644
01:30:42,801 --> 01:30:45,201
We will all contribute.

1645
01:30:47,201 --> 01:30:48,401
Okay, Jacques.

1646
01:30:48,501 --> 01:30:50,501
Then...

1647
01:30:50,701 --> 01:30:53,501
...that's it.
You have a good night now.

1648
01:30:53,601 --> 01:30:55,601
Good night, George.

1649
01:30:56,601 --> 01:30:59,551
I'd love to stuff some freedom fries
right down that frog's throat.

1650
01:30:59,651 --> 01:31:01,701
Yeah.
- Thinks he can have it both ways.

1651
01:31:01,801 --> 01:31:03,001
Ripping off their oil...

1652
01:31:03,101 --> 01:31:06,001
...and then taking the high horse
and claiming the low road.

1653
01:31:06,101 --> 01:31:09,951
Sir, don't lose any sleep over
the French. He was never onboard.

1654
01:31:10,051 --> 01:31:13,401
They got him on 60 Minutes next week
calling for 30 days for the inspectors.

1655
01:31:13,501 --> 01:31:15,501
Thirty days?

1656
01:31:15,501 --> 01:31:18,551
Next chance that comes up,
remind me to veto something French...

1657
01:31:18,651 --> 01:31:20,501
...because I'd be damn glad to.

1658
01:31:20,601 --> 01:31:22,601
What about Putin?
Get him on the phone.

1659
01:31:22,701 --> 01:31:24,101
All right.

1660
01:31:24,201 --> 01:31:26,601
Might as well get stabbed
in the back all at once.

1661
01:31:26,701 --> 01:31:29,201
Like that guy in Rome.

1662
01:31:31,901 --> 01:31:35,251
teaspoonful of dry anthrax in an envelope...

1663
01:31:35,351 --> 01:31:38,201
...shut down the United States Senate
in the fall of 2001.

1664
01:31:38,301 --> 01:31:40,001
This forced several hundred people...

1665
01:31:40,101 --> 01:31:42,301
...to undergo
emergency medical treatment...

1666
01:31:42,401 --> 01:31:44,301
...killed two postal workers...

1667
01:31:44,401 --> 01:31:48,736
...just from the amount
of just about this quantity.

1668
01:31:48,801 --> 01:31:54,051
Iraq declared 8500 liters of anthrax.

1669
01:31:54,151 --> 01:31:57,851
My man, Balloon Foot,
came through in the end, didn't he?

1670
01:31:57,951 --> 01:32:04,001
even one teaspoonful
of this deadly material.

1671
01:32:04,801 --> 01:32:07,101
You know, he's been a nudge
from the beginning...

1672
01:32:07,201 --> 01:32:10,176
...but this is gonna seal the deal.

1673
01:32:10,301 --> 01:32:13,446
It's the best speech he's ever given.

1674
01:32:16,001 --> 01:32:17,301
Can you believe that, Vice?

1675
01:32:17,401 --> 01:32:20,301
Comrade Pooty-Poot, with all
the problems he's got in Chechnya...

1676
01:32:20,401 --> 01:32:23,201
...he's got the balls to feel bad for me.

1677
01:32:23,301 --> 01:32:25,601
It's all because
of that damn Kraut, Schrצder.

1678
01:32:25,701 --> 01:32:27,601
Used me as a piסata to get re-elected.

1679
01:32:27,701 --> 01:32:29,701
I won't forget that.

1680
01:32:29,901 --> 01:32:32,901
Well, at least we got Italy, Australia...

1681
01:32:33,001 --> 01:32:35,551
...the Czechs, Spain,
Poland, South Korea...

1682
01:32:35,651 --> 01:32:37,601
...and, you know, the Brits.

1683
01:32:37,701 --> 01:32:41,551
Romania, Slovenia, Bulgaria.
- Yeah.

1684
01:32:41,651 --> 01:32:43,401
Japan is sending observers.

1685
01:32:43,501 --> 01:32:46,001
And let's not forget
the 90 Mongolian troops.

1686
01:32:46,101 --> 01:32:49,101
I hear they're damn fine wrestlers too.

1687
01:32:49,201 --> 01:32:51,751
We got more than 40 countries
in this coalition, right?

1688
01:32:51,851 --> 01:32:56,101
Yeah, 49, sir, but most of them
do not have militaries.

1689
01:32:56,201 --> 01:32:57,901
Some are sending equipment.

1690
01:32:58,001 --> 01:33:00,901
Morocco is sending monkeys.
- Monkeys?

1691
01:33:01,001 --> 01:33:04,651
Monkeys that are trained to locate
and set off minefields, yeah.

1692
01:33:04,751 --> 01:33:06,501
That's a good idea.

1693
01:33:06,601 --> 01:33:09,601
Okay, Tommy's standing by in Qatar.
- Right.

1694
01:33:09,701 --> 01:33:12,401
Hey, Tommy.
How you doing over there?

1695
01:33:12,501 --> 01:33:14,701
Hot as a goat's asshole, sir.

1696
01:33:14,801 --> 01:33:16,201
What's the latest plan, Tom?

1697
01:33:16,301 --> 01:33:19,751
Well, we should have 140,000
in the region any day now.

1698
01:33:19,851 --> 01:33:21,901
Seventy eight thousand of them
ground forces.

1699
01:33:22,001 --> 01:33:23,901
Another 50,000 are on the way.

1700
01:33:24,001 --> 01:33:27,001
We'll have a total force level
of 208,000 on the ground.

1701
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:29,101
That's great.
So you got all you need to go?

1702
01:33:29,201 --> 01:33:30,601
Yes, sir.

1703
01:33:30,701 --> 01:33:34,251
Now, sir, we have identified
over 24 high-value targets.

1704
01:33:34,351 --> 01:33:37,301
But this could result in civilian deaths.

1705
01:33:37,401 --> 01:33:40,001
I'm no target picker, Tommy,
but I'm not Clinton either.

1706
01:33:40,101 --> 01:33:44,551
I don't wanna fire no $2 million missile
at a $ 10 empty tent, and hit a camel.

1707
01:33:44,651 --> 01:33:46,401
Not gonna happen on my watch, sir.

1708
01:33:46,501 --> 01:33:48,601
Be sure not to hit any schools or hospitals.

1709
01:33:48,701 --> 01:33:52,201
Well, I read you on the hospitals.
Any schools we'll hit at night.

1710
01:33:52,301 --> 01:33:54,301
All right, what about projected casualties?

1711
01:33:54,401 --> 01:33:57,951
Well, I think now, more in
the neighborhood of several hundred.

1712
01:33:58,051 --> 01:33:59,401
No more than a thousand.

1713
01:33:59,501 --> 01:34:02,951
Remember, Americans don't like to
see dead boys on their television sets.

1714
01:34:03,051 --> 01:34:05,801
Yes, death tends to give war
a depressing image.

1715
01:34:05,901 --> 01:34:09,551
We can issue a blackout on
any coverage of soldiers in caskets.

1716
01:34:09,651 --> 01:34:12,001
The same thing should apply
to military funerals.

1717
01:34:12,101 --> 01:34:14,481
Oh, yeah, that's good, Vice.

1718
01:34:14,601 --> 01:34:15,801
Well...

1719
01:34:15,901 --> 01:34:18,801
...it's been a long haul,
gentlemen, ladies.

1720
01:34:18,901 --> 01:34:20,401
I don't care what happens now...

1721
01:34:20,501 --> 01:34:24,501
...how many damn votes we do
or don't get in the U.N.

1722
01:34:24,601 --> 01:34:27,001
Come Monday morning, 10 a. m...

1723
01:34:27,101 --> 01:34:30,651
...I'm giving Saddam and his two sons
48 hours to get out of Dodge, okay?

1724
01:34:30,751 --> 01:34:32,301
Indeed.

1725
01:34:32,401 --> 01:34:34,401
All right.

1726
01:34:35,801 --> 01:34:37,101
Everybody in agreement then?

1727
01:34:37,201 --> 01:34:38,201
Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1728
01:34:38,301 --> 01:34:40,101
All right.

1729
01:34:40,201 --> 01:34:42,401
May God bless the troops.

1730
01:34:43,201 --> 01:34:45,401
May God bless America.

1731
01:35:20,901 --> 01:35:23,951
All right, way to go.
This is like the fall of the Berlin Wall.

1732
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:25,401
I've got goose bumps.

1733
01:35:25,501 --> 01:35:28,501
Not one CBW attack. Not one Scud.
No surprises.

1734
01:35:28,601 --> 01:35:30,101
Except they're not surrendering.

1735
01:35:30,201 --> 01:35:32,701
Thousands are taking off
their uniforms and going home.

1736
01:35:32,801 --> 01:35:35,601
Well, good. I'll bet Saddam's running
from palace to palace...

1737
01:35:35,701 --> 01:35:37,301
...trying to find his passports.

1738
01:35:37,401 --> 01:35:39,401
Don't say I was wrong on this one, Colin.

1739
01:35:39,501 --> 01:35:41,001
We did it, sir. Congratulations.

1740
01:35:41,101 --> 01:35:42,401
We sure did, Colin.

1741
01:35:42,501 --> 01:35:44,501
Congratulations.
- Good to see you smiling.

1742
01:35:44,601 --> 01:35:46,601
What do you mean we, kemosabe?

1743
01:35:46,701 --> 01:35:47,701
Hey, good job.

1744
01:35:47,801 --> 01:35:50,201
Hey.
- Good job, sir. Good job.

1745
01:35:50,301 --> 01:35:51,801
I remember you once agreeing...

1746
01:35:51,901 --> 01:35:54,451
...that going all the way to Baghdad
would be a mistake.

1747
01:35:54,551 --> 01:35:56,401
I think you made a bigger boo-boo, Colin.

1748
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:58,201
You could've been president.

1749
01:35:58,301 --> 01:36:00,301
Fuck you.

1750
01:36:04,701 --> 01:36:07,001
This is for those who doubted
I won the election.

1751
01:36:07,101 --> 01:36:08,901
Yes, sir.
- And who doubted my judgment.

1752
01:36:09,001 --> 01:36:12,401
So dropping a rope around its neck,
that didn't bring it down.

1753
01:36:12,501 --> 01:36:15,951
They took an ax to the base of
the statue, that didn't bring it down.

1754
01:36:16,051 --> 01:36:18,701
And this is finally what did.

1755
01:36:18,801 --> 01:36:23,051
Yeah. We got the son of a bitch.
How about that?

1756
01:36:23,151 --> 01:36:26,126
Maybe he called it right after all.

1757
01:36:26,601 --> 01:36:28,801
Well, they got the statue...

1758
01:36:28,901 --> 01:36:31,961
...but now they gotta catch the man.

1759
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:40,801
Live from New York City,
this is SpinBall...

1760
01:36:40,901 --> 01:36:44,001
...with Jack Hawk and Candice Black.

1761
01:36:47,501 --> 01:36:49,701
What did you think of that?
That was spectacular.

1762
01:36:49,801 --> 01:36:51,101
Jack, it's really stunning.

1763
01:36:51,201 --> 01:36:55,251
I mean, he's landing on a boat
at 150 miles per hour.

1764
01:36:55,351 --> 01:36:57,501
I can't think of a Democrat
that would do that.

1765
01:36:57,601 --> 01:36:59,201
Exactly. Imagine Kerry.

1766
01:36:59,301 --> 01:37:01,301
Kerry would never be able to pull this off.

1767
01:37:01,401 --> 01:37:04,301
This is the guy who threw down
someone else's Vietnam medals.

1768
01:37:04,401 --> 01:37:07,251
George Bush, on the other hand,
a man's man.

1769
01:37:07,351 --> 01:37:11,201
Women love that. We're buying
into that, and perception is reality.

1770
01:37:11,301 --> 01:37:13,201
George Bush looks for real, all right.

1771
01:37:13,301 --> 01:37:16,451
He didn't fight in the war,
but he looks like he did.

1772
01:37:16,551 --> 01:37:19,801
And women love President Bush
for this very reason.

1773
01:37:19,901 --> 01:37:22,901
And women love this war. It's simple.

1774
01:37:23,001 --> 01:37:24,801
My fellow Americans...

1775
01:37:24,901 --> 01:37:28,351
...major combat operations in Iraq
has ended.

1776
01:37:28,451 --> 01:37:30,501
In the battle of Iraq...

1777
01:37:30,601 --> 01:37:34,901
...the United States and our allies
have prevailed.

1778
01:37:38,701 --> 01:37:41,701
In the images of celebrating Iraqis...

1779
01:37:41,801 --> 01:37:45,351
...we have seen the ageless appeal
of human freedom.

1780
01:37:45,451 --> 01:37:49,531
Everywhere that freedom steers,
let tyrants fear.

1781
01:37:49,901 --> 01:37:55,341
That is the Almighty's gift to every
man and woman in this world.

1782
01:37:55,601 --> 01:37:57,401
May God bless you all.

1783
01:37:57,501 --> 01:38:00,731
And may God continue to bless America.

1784
01:38:11,601 --> 01:38:14,701
Roadside bombs
killed six U.S. soldiers today...

1785
01:38:14,801 --> 01:38:17,451
...in separate attacks
in Fallujah and Baghdad.

1786
01:38:17,551 --> 01:38:22,226
To date, 853 American soldiers
have been killed in Iraq.

1787
01:38:23,601 --> 01:38:26,301
The bombing continues
a recent pattern of insurgency...

1788
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:30,351
...directed at American troops,
but also the Iraqi civilian population...

1789
01:38:30,451 --> 01:38:35,601
...which is divided between Shiite
and Sunni religious affiliations.

1790
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:37,701
The truck bomb killed at least 17...

1791
01:38:37,801 --> 01:38:41,601
...and wounded over 100
at the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad.

1792
01:38:41,701 --> 01:38:45,001
The blast also killed
U.N. Ambassador Sergio de Mello...

1793
01:38:45,101 --> 01:38:47,201
...who appears to have been
the main target.

1794
01:38:47,301 --> 01:38:49,901
Back up. Back up.

1795
01:38:50,401 --> 01:38:52,101
Former members of the Iraqi army...

1796
01:38:52,201 --> 01:38:54,951
...are protesting the dissolution
of the armed forces.

1797
01:38:55,051 --> 01:38:57,401
They have guns
but no food to feed their families.

1798
01:38:57,501 --> 01:39:00,301
Some have threatened
they will resort to suicide attacks...

1799
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:03,886
...if their grievances are not addressed.

1800
01:39:06,701 --> 01:39:10,501
The Pentagon told me we'd be down
to 25 to 30,000 troops by August.

1801
01:39:10,601 --> 01:39:12,201
Is that anywhere near possible now?

1802
01:39:12,301 --> 01:39:16,351
Well, I'm afraid, Mr. President, we're
in for a longer haul than we thought.

1803
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:18,901
Then where the hell are the WMDs at?

1804
01:39:19,001 --> 01:39:24,201
Well, we control the country now, sir,
so I'm sure we're gonna find them.

1805
01:39:24,301 --> 01:39:25,401
All right, tell me this.

1806
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:29,901
Whose job is it
to find these damn weapons?

1807
01:39:32,501 --> 01:39:36,101
Bremer, I mean, you're running
the whole show here, right?

1808
01:39:36,201 --> 01:39:38,401
Well?
- That's not within my purview, sir.

1809
01:39:38,501 --> 01:39:41,101
I thought General Franks
was taking the initiative there.

1810
01:39:41,201 --> 01:39:43,301
Tom, you're commander
of the whole shebang...

1811
01:39:43,401 --> 01:39:46,651
That area was never part
of my command responsibility, sir.

1812
01:39:46,751 --> 01:39:52,361
There was a team assigned by the...
- No, no. Who? Who's in charge?

1813
01:39:55,901 --> 01:39:59,896
Well, as per Secretary Rumsfeld's
wishes, sir...

1814
01:39:59,901 --> 01:40:02,751
...most normal post-op
State Department functions, sir...

1815
01:40:02,851 --> 01:40:04,901
...were stripped from us
and given to Defense.

1816
01:40:05,001 --> 01:40:07,201
Why wasn't I told?

1817
01:40:07,701 --> 01:40:09,601
What's Rummy say about this?

1818
01:40:09,701 --> 01:40:14,151
Cambone... I believe that it's
Stephen Cambone's jurisdiction, sir.

1819
01:40:14,251 --> 01:40:16,601
Cam... What is that?
Cam who? Cam who?

1820
01:40:16,701 --> 01:40:20,351
Well, he's undersecretary of defense
for intelligence, Mr. President.

1821
01:40:20,451 --> 01:40:22,501
He reports to Secretary Rumsfeld.

1822
01:40:22,601 --> 01:40:23,801
Well, that's great.

1823
01:40:23,901 --> 01:40:26,111
I mean, that's just great.

1824
01:40:26,901 --> 01:40:31,236
Why the heck didn't anyone
tell me this before, huh?

1825
01:40:32,901 --> 01:40:36,131
Mr. President,
I wanna go back to Iraq.

1826
01:40:37,801 --> 01:40:40,436
Look, let me make this clear...

1827
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:45,551
...since I've had some experience
dealing with these matters.

1828
01:40:46,001 --> 01:40:50,251
My son has got the toughest position
in the world.

1829
01:40:50,351 --> 01:40:54,101
He's the one
who gets the intelligence briefings.

1830
01:40:54,201 --> 01:40:56,001
And as Americans...

1831
01:40:56,101 --> 01:40:58,501
...it's our duty to fully support his efforts...

1832
01:40:58,601 --> 01:41:03,021
...to bring freedom and democracy
to the Middle East.

1833
01:41:03,901 --> 01:41:05,901
And as a father...

1834
01:41:06,401 --> 01:41:08,501
...I'll be damned if I'll listen to people...

1835
01:41:08,601 --> 01:41:12,426
...who are always trying
to tear the boy down.

1836
01:41:13,401 --> 01:41:16,001
And you know what?
They built him a set of metal legs...

1837
01:41:16,101 --> 01:41:18,001
...made him faster than what he used to be.

1838
01:41:18,101 --> 01:41:19,901
They make them that good these days.

1839
01:41:20,001 --> 01:41:23,601
You and I are gonna run together, son,
soon as you get back on your feet.

1840
01:41:23,701 --> 01:41:26,401
I give you my promise, all right?

1841
01:41:26,501 --> 01:41:28,501
Okay?

1842
01:41:46,401 --> 01:41:49,601
Got him a shirt. Maybe you can
give it to him when he wakes up.

1843
01:41:49,701 --> 01:41:51,301
I'd like...

1844
01:41:51,401 --> 01:41:53,401
...to stand up for you, sir.

1845
01:41:53,501 --> 01:41:54,901
No, you don't, sergeant.

1846
01:41:55,001 --> 01:41:57,351
No, I'm the one standing up for you.

1847
01:41:57,451 --> 01:41:59,901
Laura and I are looking forward
to seeing you next trip.

1848
01:42:00,001 --> 01:42:01,501
All right, now?
- That's right.

1849
01:42:01,601 --> 01:42:04,066
All right, you hang in there.

1850
01:42:06,401 --> 01:42:08,401
Thank you.

1851
01:42:14,701 --> 01:42:16,701
Thank you.

1852
01:42:18,301 --> 01:42:20,401
David, good to see you.

1853
01:42:20,501 --> 01:42:24,156
Mr. President.
- So, what do you got for us?

1854
01:42:26,001 --> 01:42:28,201
You used to love pecan pie,
Mr. President.

1855
01:42:28,301 --> 01:42:30,901
I've given up sweets
since the start of the war, Rummy.

1856
01:42:31,001 --> 01:42:34,101
My personal sacrifice
to show support for our troops.

1857
01:42:34,201 --> 01:42:38,501
The best pie I've ever tasted,
Mr. President.

1858
01:42:39,101 --> 01:42:43,551
So, what you're telling me, David,
comes down to nothing on nothing?

1859
01:42:43,651 --> 01:42:44,701
Frankly, we missed it...

1860
01:42:44,801 --> 01:42:48,101
...because Saddam pretended
that he had the weapons.

1861
01:42:48,201 --> 01:42:49,201
It doesn't make sense.

1862
01:42:49,301 --> 01:42:53,301
Why would he risk his life and
government by not coming clean?

1863
01:42:53,401 --> 01:42:55,601
Because I think...

1864
01:42:55,701 --> 01:42:58,551
...he didn't want his people to know
he didn't have the weapons.

1865
01:42:58,651 --> 01:43:01,101
Part of his Superman image.

1866
01:43:01,201 --> 01:43:03,901
Afraid they'd cut his throat
if they found out the truth.

1867
01:43:04,001 --> 01:43:06,601
You're saying this guy
was running a full house off a pair?

1868
01:43:06,701 --> 01:43:08,001
Come on, that's just nuts.

1869
01:43:08,101 --> 01:43:11,101
He really thought you were bluffing.
Right up to the end.

1870
01:43:11,201 --> 01:43:13,401
Me, bluff?

1871
01:43:13,501 --> 01:43:18,501
How could the CIA, all our
intel people, completely muff this?

1872
01:43:18,601 --> 01:43:20,901
I told Mr. Tenet from the beginning...

1873
01:43:21,001 --> 01:43:25,301
...that things weren't panning out
the way we thought they existed.

1874
01:43:25,401 --> 01:43:27,201
And your National Security advisers...

1875
01:43:27,301 --> 01:43:30,601
...should've got into this, gotten
the details and vetted them for you.

1876
01:43:30,701 --> 01:43:32,701
Believe me, Dr. Kay...

1877
01:43:32,701 --> 01:43:35,101
...when I say we were getting
thousands of reports...

1878
01:43:35,201 --> 01:43:37,201
...and not just from you or the CIA.

1879
01:43:37,301 --> 01:43:40,401
I don't see... I don't know that
putting the blame on some...

1880
01:43:40,501 --> 01:43:45,151
Mr. President, I think we're being
overly negative in a situation...

1881
01:43:45,251 --> 01:43:48,851
...where, indeed,
we lack the metrics...

1882
01:43:48,951 --> 01:43:52,251
...to judge the overall success
of the global war on terror.

1883
01:43:52,351 --> 01:43:56,801
My office sent to you spy satellite photos...

1884
01:43:56,901 --> 01:44:00,951
...that showed that WMDs
could be hidden in caves...

1885
01:44:01,051 --> 01:44:03,401
...that you never responded to.

1886
01:44:03,501 --> 01:44:07,101
We analyzed those photos,
Mr. Vice President...

1887
01:44:07,201 --> 01:44:11,651
...and they are actually trenches,
watering holes for cattle.

1888
01:44:11,751 --> 01:44:13,401
Not caves.

1889
01:44:13,501 --> 01:44:15,501
That's not what my people told me.

1890
01:44:15,601 --> 01:44:17,201
Vice, you grew up in Wyoming.

1891
01:44:17,301 --> 01:44:20,106
You should damn well know cattle.

1892
01:44:20,201 --> 01:44:23,551
I mean, there you go.
You fool me once, shame on you.

1893
01:44:23,651 --> 01:44:25,701
Now, fool me twice...

1894
01:44:26,801 --> 01:44:29,691
...and you can't get fooled again.

1895
01:44:33,301 --> 01:44:35,426
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

1896
01:44:36,101 --> 01:44:38,801
We thought he had WMDs.

1897
01:44:39,501 --> 01:44:42,221
But we were all wrong about him.

1898
01:44:43,701 --> 01:44:45,701
And I include myself.

1899
01:44:51,501 --> 01:44:53,501
Our system...

1900
01:44:54,301 --> 01:44:56,426
...the integrity of it...

1901
01:44:56,801 --> 01:44:59,351
...has broken down completely.

1902
01:45:02,201 --> 01:45:06,101
And I have never traded access
for integrity.

1903
01:45:07,301 --> 01:45:10,301
And I am obligated to resign.

1904
01:45:35,201 --> 01:45:37,501
That was some shit sandwich
he served for lunch.

1905
01:45:37,601 --> 01:45:39,801
Working on it. We can
find someone who can deliver.

1906
01:45:39,901 --> 01:45:42,201
I don't buy it. He had those weapons.
- No doubt.

1907
01:45:42,301 --> 01:45:43,601
But now we shift the ground.

1908
01:45:43,701 --> 01:45:45,501
Keep the focus on freedom and democracy.

1909
01:45:45,601 --> 01:45:47,201
Rumsfeld is on another planet.

1910
01:45:47,301 --> 01:45:50,201
Sometimes I wonder.
I think he's lost it.

1911
01:45:50,301 --> 01:45:52,101
What about Iran?
- Oh, yeah.

1912
01:45:52,201 --> 01:45:54,401
Bigtime uranium-enrichment
program going on.

1913
01:45:54,501 --> 01:45:56,801
We're on it.
- Stay on it.

1914
01:45:56,901 --> 01:45:58,001
There's something there.

1915
01:45:58,101 --> 01:45:59,801
I can feel it.

1916
01:45:59,901 --> 01:46:00,956
Kansas State and Ohio State,

1917
01:46:01,056 --> 01:46:02,901
a pair of top- 10 teams
squared off......

1918
01:46:03,001 --> 01:46:05,651
...in the Fiesta Bowl.
That was for the championship.

1919
01:46:05,751 --> 01:46:09,321
Krenzel, your MVP,
four touchdowns passing.

1920
01:46:13,401 --> 01:46:15,401
Funny thing...

1921
01:46:16,501 --> 01:46:18,501
...Poppy once said.

1922
01:46:20,101 --> 01:46:22,201
I didn't appreciate it.

1923
01:46:23,401 --> 01:46:25,601
What was that, Geo?

1924
01:46:27,201 --> 01:46:29,201
Something about:

1925
01:46:30,001 --> 01:46:34,166
'Sometimes it's better to stay
out of the barrel.'

1926
01:46:42,301 --> 01:46:44,401
These lines here...

1927
01:46:45,401 --> 01:46:48,801
...seem like they just dug in overnight.

1928
01:46:49,101 --> 01:46:51,301
You're as handsome as ever, Geo.

1929
01:46:51,401 --> 01:46:54,716
Only makes you look more distinguished.

1930
01:46:56,801 --> 01:47:02,071
Your favorite play is coming to town.
Why don't we get tickets?

1931
01:47:05,001 --> 01:47:06,501
Cats.

1932
01:47:06,601 --> 01:47:09,201
The Broadway company
is going to be here.

1933
01:47:09,301 --> 01:47:11,301
You wanna go?

1934
01:47:11,801 --> 01:47:13,801
Cats?

1935
01:47:14,301 --> 01:47:16,501
That's something I'd stay up late for.
Definitely.

1936
01:47:16,601 --> 01:47:18,601
I thought so.

1937
01:47:22,301 --> 01:47:24,426
You know, I don't get it.

1938
01:47:25,201 --> 01:47:28,801
All this psychobabble in the media.

1939
01:47:29,201 --> 01:47:33,251
I mean, all I wanted to do
is make this a better and safer world...

1940
01:47:33,351 --> 01:47:35,351
...for everyone.

1941
01:47:36,001 --> 01:47:37,901
There's good and there's evil.

1942
01:47:38,001 --> 01:47:43,801
And you and I and the rest of the
people in America know the difference.

1943
01:47:43,901 --> 01:47:46,451
That good ultimately wins out.

1944
01:47:49,401 --> 01:47:53,351
But you have to fight for it.
You have to fight for it.

1945
01:47:53,451 --> 01:47:58,001
People have no idea how hard it is on us.

1946
01:47:59,901 --> 01:48:02,601
The sacrifices you've made.

1947
01:48:02,901 --> 01:48:06,601
Laura, I knew when I married you
what you were made of.

1948
01:48:06,701 --> 01:48:09,951
That same bolt of lightning hit both of us.

1949
01:48:10,051 --> 01:48:12,051
For better or worse.

1950
01:48:12,101 --> 01:48:14,201
Mostly better.

1951
01:48:18,701 --> 01:48:21,101
Since the start of the war, though...

1952
01:48:21,201 --> 01:48:24,901
...I barely have time
to run my three miles anymore.

1953
01:48:25,001 --> 01:48:26,101
My knees hurt.

1954
01:48:26,201 --> 01:48:28,601
I'm just off my pace.

1955
01:48:29,701 --> 01:48:31,801
It's been hard on me, Laura.

1956
01:48:31,901 --> 01:48:34,401
On top of everything else.

1957
01:48:34,501 --> 01:48:36,501
Well...

1958
01:48:36,701 --> 01:48:39,421
...someday the war will be over.

1959
01:48:39,601 --> 01:48:42,236
And we can have our lives back.

1960
01:48:44,901 --> 01:48:48,046
I'll get those tickets for next week.

1961
01:48:54,801 --> 01:48:57,901
Poppy, what are you doing here?
- I used to sit in this chair.

1962
01:48:58,001 --> 01:49:00,001
Opposite Baker.

1963
01:49:01,701 --> 01:49:07,141
Got him to help pull your ass
out of the fire in Florida in 2000.

1964
01:49:07,301 --> 01:49:09,301
Don't forget that.

1965
01:49:10,001 --> 01:49:11,401
Come on. Let's go.

1966
01:49:11,501 --> 01:49:13,901
A little mano a mano.

1967
01:49:15,301 --> 01:49:18,401
Bet you I can still whip your ass.
- What?

1968
01:49:18,501 --> 01:49:22,101
Got to admit, I scared you back then.
Still scare you, don't I?

1969
01:49:22,201 --> 01:49:27,046
I got a lot on my mind.
I don't need this, Poppy. Not now.

1970
01:49:30,201 --> 01:49:32,241
Why you being so ornery?

1971
01:49:32,301 --> 01:49:34,501
Because you disappoint me, Junior.

1972
01:49:34,601 --> 01:49:36,401
Deeply disappoint me.

1973
01:49:36,501 --> 01:49:39,201
After all these years. Still?

1974
01:49:39,301 --> 01:49:41,801
You're still with that?
- No, no, no.

1975
01:49:41,901 --> 01:49:45,101
Not the girls or summer jobs anymore.

1976
01:49:47,501 --> 01:49:50,651
I dug myself out of the depths of hell
to stand on my own two feet...

1977
01:49:50,751 --> 01:49:53,401
...make something of myself.
And I did it on my own.

1978
01:49:53,501 --> 01:49:54,901
Think you did.

1979
01:49:55,001 --> 01:49:57,001
Yeah, well, you also wrecked it.

1980
01:49:57,101 --> 01:49:58,501
Wrecked. Wrecked what?

1981
01:49:58,601 --> 01:50:00,401
You've ruined it for us.

1982
01:50:00,501 --> 01:50:02,801
What are you talking about?
- The Bush name.

1983
01:50:02,901 --> 01:50:04,001
Get out of my office.

1984
01:50:04,101 --> 01:50:06,801
Two hundred years of work. For Jeb.

1985
01:50:06,901 --> 01:50:08,601
Get out.

1986
01:50:08,701 --> 01:50:11,651
With this fiasco.

1987
01:50:11,751 --> 01:50:13,101
Get out of my life.

1988
01:50:13,201 --> 01:50:15,201
And that's what it is.

1989
01:50:15,201 --> 01:50:16,501
A goddamn fiasco.

1990
01:50:16,601 --> 01:50:18,101
Get out.

1991
01:50:18,201 --> 01:50:20,601
George. George.

1992
01:50:21,301 --> 01:50:22,701
Are you all right?

1993
01:50:22,801 --> 01:50:24,801
Oh, Jesus.

1994
01:50:24,801 --> 01:50:27,101
Jesus, George.

1995
01:50:31,401 --> 01:50:33,701
There's been tough weeks in Iraq.

1996
01:50:33,801 --> 01:50:35,701
But our central commitment
of the mission...

1997
01:50:35,801 --> 01:50:40,731
...is the transfer of sovereignty
back to the Iraqi people.

1998
01:50:41,001 --> 01:50:43,701
Now, we've set a deadline
for this to take place...

1999
01:50:43,801 --> 01:50:45,701
...three months from now.

2000
01:50:45,801 --> 01:50:49,101
June 30, 2004.

2001
01:50:55,501 --> 01:50:59,921
It's important that
we meet that deadline, all right?

2002
01:51:01,201 --> 01:51:03,411
The only way we can win...

2003
01:51:05,401 --> 01:51:09,001
...is to leave before the job is done.

2004
01:51:10,401 --> 01:51:12,401
Yeah.

2005
01:51:12,701 --> 01:51:14,001
I'll now take questions.

2006
01:51:14,101 --> 01:51:15,101
Mr. President.
- Sir.

2007
01:51:15,201 --> 01:51:16,701
Sir, sir.
- Question, sir.

2008
01:51:16,801 --> 01:51:18,801
Yeah.

2009
01:51:19,501 --> 01:51:20,901
Miss China?

2010
01:51:21,001 --> 01:51:23,401
Mr. President,
I know this is a tough question...

2011
01:51:23,501 --> 01:51:26,551
...but my viewers would really like to know.

2012
01:51:26,651 --> 01:51:29,201
What place do you think
you'll have in history?

2013
01:51:29,301 --> 01:51:31,301
In history?

2014
01:51:32,101 --> 01:51:33,501
I don't know.

2015
01:51:33,601 --> 01:51:36,001
In history, we'll all be dead.

2016
01:51:36,101 --> 01:51:38,101
Mr. President?
- Yeah.

2017
01:51:38,501 --> 01:51:41,001
Mr. President?
- Yeah, John, there.

2018
01:51:41,101 --> 01:51:43,001
Thank you, sir. Mr. President.
- Yeah.

2019
01:51:43,101 --> 01:51:47,501
After 9l11, what would you say
your biggest mistakes would be...

2020
01:51:47,601 --> 01:51:51,511
...and what lessons
have you learned from them?

2021
01:51:57,901 --> 01:51:59,601
Now, I wish you would have given me...

2022
01:51:59,701 --> 01:52:03,356
...this written question beforehand,
John...

2023
01:52:03,701 --> 01:52:06,166
...so I could prepare for it.

2024
01:52:09,401 --> 01:52:11,401
You know, I just...

2025
01:52:15,801 --> 01:52:18,901
John, I'm sure historians will say,
'Gosh,' you know.

2026
01:52:19,001 --> 01:52:24,441
'I wish he could've done better,
you know, this way or that way.'

2027
01:52:29,301 --> 01:52:32,251
Something will pop into my head
here in the press conference...

2028
01:52:32,351 --> 01:52:35,201
...with all the pressure of trying
to come up with an answer...

2029
01:52:35,301 --> 01:52:37,301
...but it hasn't yet.

2030
01:52:40,301 --> 01:52:42,301
You know, I hope...

2031
01:52:42,601 --> 01:52:45,701
I don't wanna sound like
I haven't made no mistakes.

2032
01:52:45,801 --> 01:52:48,201
You know, I'm confident I have.

2033
01:52:48,301 --> 01:52:50,301
It's just, I haven't...

2034
01:52:52,201 --> 01:52:54,401
You know, you really put me
on the spot here...

2035
01:52:54,501 --> 01:52:55,601
...and maybe I'm not...

2036
01:52:55,701 --> 01:53:00,716
...as quick on my feet
as I should be in coming up with one.

2037
01:53:21,201 --> 01:53:22,401
Mr. President.

2038
01:53:22,501 --> 01:53:25,301
Not now, Ari. Not now. I'm busy.

2039
01:53:34,401 --> 01:53:38,001
We're locked into a dandy, 1- 1 here, 
bottom of the eighth, two outs...

2040
01:53:38,101 --> 01:53:39,501
...as Spencer stands in.

2041
01:53:39,601 --> 01:53:41,401
He's 3-for-3 on the night.

2042
01:53:41,501 --> 01:53:44,101
This is the first time he's come up
with a man on base.

2043
01:53:44,201 --> 01:53:45,801
He hasn't had a chance to do damage.

2044
01:53:45,901 --> 01:53:48,001
He'd certainly love to do some here.

2045
01:53:48,101 --> 01:53:51,001
Monroe off of first. That was
the starting pitcher by the way.

2046
01:53:51,101 --> 01:53:53,201
Jay Fletcher you just saw down
in the bullpen.

2047
01:53:53,301 --> 01:53:54,501
Woodhouse is on deck.

2048
01:53:54,601 --> 01:53:56,601
Schwartz will follow if we get that far.

2049
01:53:56,701 --> 01:53:58,901
Chavez now from the stretch.

2050
01:53:59,001 --> 01:54:00,601
And the pitch to Monroe.

2051
01:54:00,701 --> 01:54:03,201
Swinging, there's a fly ball into right field.

2052
01:54:03,301 --> 01:54:04,601
Moving over.

2053
01:54:04,701 --> 01:54:06,101
He dives, he misses the ball.

2054
01:54:06,201 --> 01:54:08,401
Monroe rounds first.
He heads for second.

2055
01:54:08,501 --> 01:54:11,101
And here comes Spencer
around third going for home.

2056
01:54:11,201 --> 01:54:12,801
The relay to the plate is...

2057
01:54:12,901 --> 01:54:16,981
...not in time.
And Texas takes the lead, 2 to 1.

2058
01:54:17,305 --> 01:55:17,324
