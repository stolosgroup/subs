These are delicious.
I'll give you some.

3
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,462
This is a bracelet of hope.

4
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,715
Thank you!

<i>Kagome kagome</i>

00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:24,218
<i>The bird in the cage.</i>

{\an8}<i>When, oh, when will it come out</i>

<i>Who is behind you now?</i>

11
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,239
Good to see you children.

12
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,942
The Governor!

13
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,822
Come on, let's move!

14
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:30,025
Where did you come from?

15
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:32,611
Do you want to join us?

16
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:35,906
There are so many of us.

17
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:39,618
What's your name?

18
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:42,996
Can't you speak?
Say something!

19
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,041
Hey! Talk!

20
00:27:51,547 --> 00:27:55,384
We are almost there!
Hang in there!

21
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,835
If time starts moving...

22
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:14,755
...everything will explode again!

23
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:18,342
Keep time from moving!

24
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:26,099
Thick red blood!

25
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:29,102
He has thick red blood!

26
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:35,234
The Prophecy!
Time will move again!

27
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:42,741
Thick red blood!

28
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:44,993
Maybe someday...

29
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:48,372
...these children can drink
wonderful water...

30
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:52,334
...breathe wonderful air.
live in a wonderful world!

31
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:55,045
Feel the fresh blood
on their faces!

32
00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:14,773
Stop it!

33
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:51,685
Ratman! Get the fuck out!

34
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:08,929
Go find her yourself!

35
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:30,571
Everyone!

36
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:32,322
It's time to read.

37
00:42:52,614 --> 00:42:55,117
These are delicious.
I'll give you some.

38
00:50:20,521 --> 00:50:23,690
Many years ago,
when I was just a child

39
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:28,195
There was a catastrophic wreck,
at mile 244...

40
00:50:29,112 --> 00:50:31,281
It was the age of nuclear towers.

41
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:34,284
There was a massive reactor,

42
00:50:34,785 --> 00:50:38,497
strong enough to power an empire,

43
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:40,457
...or destroy it.

44
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:46,672
Beneath it all...
the waste, the boiling toxic waste.

45
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:49,258
Buried, hidden, unclean.

46
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:50,968
The hidden secret legacy.

47
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:54,972
A mighty tanker burdened with
molten nuclear sludge.

48
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:59,935
On the searing highway
outside of the city... lost control.

49
00:51:00,394 --> 00:51:05,482
It struck a transport carrying
deadly convicted men.

50
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:10,737
Covering them all with
the scalding atomic disease.

51
00:51:11,697 --> 00:51:14,992
The burning!
The hideous burning!

52
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:19,121
The fire crept into the soil,
the ancient polluted earth

53
00:51:19,705 --> 00:51:23,250
Every stone and tree had
sucked up the buried poison.

54
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:26,628
The entire city burst into flames!

55
00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:54,573
We called for help!

56
00:51:54,615 --> 00:51:57,534
We called to the powerful
men in the atomic towers.

57
00:51:57,951 --> 00:52:02,539
But the men of the toxic
empire could not confess it.

58
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,791
They must deny it...

59
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,460
Deny them all.

60
00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:23,185
You found Bernice. The innocent soul.

61
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:25,229
Gave her a chance.

62
00:52:25,604 --> 00:52:27,689
You are a hero.

63
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:06,223
It's empty!

64
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,016
I'm sorry!

65
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:18,861
Governor, you command all the time.

66
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:22,489
You are the time!

67
00:55:23,073 --> 00:55:27,035
You are the greatest and
most powerful clock.

68
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:30,831
And your second hand is sharp and
more dangerous than a knife!

69
01:03:29,726 --> 01:03:31,979
You have a duty to complete.

70
01:03:32,229 --> 01:03:35,065
We will give you another life.

71
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:10,475
Hello girls!
Good evening.

72
01:04:10,726 --> 01:04:13,604
There are so many pretty girls.

73
01:04:15,647 --> 01:04:18,692
Don't I deserve a girl tonight?

74
01:04:19,401 --> 01:04:20,819
You?

75
01:04:22,905 --> 01:04:25,574
You are a pretty one, too.

76
01:04:28,535 --> 01:04:29,828
Hey!

77
01:04:30,162 --> 01:04:32,623
Yasujiro!

78
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:37,127
Who should I pick?

79
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,255
Did you pick already?

80
01:04:40,297 --> 01:04:41,882
Yasujiro-chan!

81
01:04:42,174 --> 01:04:43,383
Brother?

82
01:04:43,425 --> 01:04:45,260
Brother, are you here?

83
01:04:45,302 --> 01:04:48,347
Is this your sister Yasujiro?!

84
01:04:49,681 --> 01:04:50,974
Show yourself now!

85
01:04:51,266 --> 01:04:52,476
Brother!

86
01:04:52,518 --> 01:04:54,102
Brother, are you here!

87
01:04:54,144 --> 01:04:55,270
Show your face!

88
01:05:02,194 --> 01:05:03,237
Kill him!

89
01:05:50,701 --> 01:05:52,327
Brother wait!

90
01:05:52,911 --> 01:05:54,454
I know everything!

91
01:05:56,456 --> 01:06:00,794
You work for the Governor
because of me.

92
01:06:01,503 --> 01:06:05,465
He promised if you did then
he would let me go, didn't he?

93
01:06:06,258 --> 01:06:07,551
That's a lie!

94
01:06:07,926 --> 01:06:09,344
He is a liar!

95
01:06:10,304 --> 01:06:11,847
Brother...

96
01:06:12,222 --> 01:06:14,224
Please leave him.

97
01:08:06,128 --> 01:08:09,590
Where did you come from?
Where are you from?

98
01:08:14,344 --> 01:08:17,221
Where did you come from?
Where are you from?

99
01:08:26,356 --> 01:08:27,691
Please.

100
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:30,611
Thank you very much.

101
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,082
Delicious.

102
01:08:54,051 --> 01:08:56,511
Where are you going?
Wait.

103
01:08:56,553 --> 01:08:58,305
I'm coming with you.
Where are you going?

104
01:09:00,807 --> 01:09:03,227
Hero! Hey! Hero!

105
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:07,523
Where are you going?
Hero!

106
01:12:59,296 --> 01:13:01,632
It doesn't matter anyway!

107
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:29,493
Forward! Forward!

108
01:14:11,702 --> 01:14:14,496
Hey! Ratman is having fun.
Let's go!

109
01:17:03,123 --> 01:17:06,793
It crashed into the bus
carrying violent convicts.

110
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:11,924
It covered them in nuclear waste.

111
01:17:13,342 --> 01:17:15,969
The burning!
The hideous burning!

112
01:20:06,348 --> 01:20:07,808
Maybe it's a lie.

113
01:20:14,231 --> 01:20:16,441
Here they come!

114
01:28:24,888 --> 01:28:29,434
Governor, I thought there was going to
be a statue of you in this town!

115
01:28:32,771 --> 01:28:34,189
You don't have any money!

116
01:28:34,231 --> 01:28:35,399
You are useless.

117
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,441
Loser!

118
01:33:34,865 --> 01:33:37,618
Everyone!
We are free!

119
01:33:47,669 --> 01:33:49,463
We are free from time!

120
01:33:49,755 --> 01:33:51,632
You can let go!

121
01:34:13,278 --> 01:34:16,448
Look, they did it!
Time is starting again! Quick!

121
01:34:17,305 --> 01:35:17,161
