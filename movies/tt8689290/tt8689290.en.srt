3
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:31,223
Okay.

4
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:35,327
Okay, it's just 50 minutes.

5
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:39,666
Worst thing that happens

6
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:41,868
is you walk in.

7
00:00:44,436 --> 00:00:46,639
Okay, okay.

8
00:00:46,673 --> 00:00:50,542
Just do it, just walk in,
just go in.

9
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:52,779
One, two, three, go.

10
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:25,544
If you had to use three words
to describe yourself,

11
00:01:25,577 --> 00:01:26,813
what would they be?

12
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,282
Um...

13
00:01:34,453 --> 00:01:36,022
Disappointment.

14
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,993
Um...

15
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,665
Burden.

16
00:01:50,837 --> 00:01:53,405
Failure.

17
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:56,676
How often do you remind yourself
of those words?

18
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:58,577
Every day.

19
00:01:59,812 --> 00:02:01,613
And do you truly believe

20
00:02:01,647 --> 00:02:04,382
that you are
any of these things?

21
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,450
Yes.

22
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:11,657
You said that college

23
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:13,626
was the happiest time
of your life.

24
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:15,393
Yeah.

25
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:18,497
Would you mind
expanding on that?

26
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,666
What was that like?

27
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:25,537
In college, you're invincible.

28
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,774
Nothing can break you.

29
00:02:27,807 --> 00:02:30,509
Invincible.

30
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:32,678
Why is that?

31
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,817
Because I had my friends.

32
00:02:39,518 --> 00:02:43,689
And I had goals, plans.

33
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:49,361
And that is
a very deadly combination.

34
00:02:49,394 --> 00:02:51,363
Deadly how?

35
00:02:51,396 --> 00:02:54,366
It creates a blanket.

36
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:55,701
Blanket.

37
00:02:55,735 --> 00:02:58,403
Is writing this much normal?

38
00:02:58,436 --> 00:02:59,839
Yes.

39
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:06,145
Um...

40
00:03:06,179 --> 00:03:09,381
I'm sorry, I don't remember
what I was...

41
00:03:09,414 --> 00:03:10,817
A blanket?

42
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:16,722
Do you, uh, do you mind
if we, uh, stop for today?

43
00:03:16,756 --> 00:03:19,959
I'm just feeling kind of tired.

44
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,694
Plus, I got to start packing.

45
00:03:21,727 --> 00:03:23,395
I usually procrastinate
these things

46
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:25,064
till I'm halfway out the door.

47
00:03:25,097 --> 00:03:28,100
Packing for what?

48
00:03:28,134 --> 00:03:30,535
My old roommate
sent me a letter

49
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:32,571
inviting us all up
to his lake house this weekend.

50
00:03:32,604 --> 00:03:34,674
Big news.

51
00:03:34,707 --> 00:03:36,943
I didn't even know Roger moved.

52
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:39,145
Well, enjoy yourself.

53
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:40,579
I will.

54
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,482
- Zach?
- Yeah?

55
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:48,120
How are they healing?

56
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,428
Yeah, I decided to go.

57
00:03:56,461 --> 00:03:57,797
I don't know,
I haven't seen them

58
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:58,998
in, like, five years.

59
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:02,567
I'm sure it'll be a very
unsurprising weekend with them.

60
00:04:04,136 --> 00:04:06,605
What I mean is,
as soon as I see Gil,

61
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,808
he's inevitably
going to piss me off.

62
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:10,142
Rowan will pretend
that James and her

63
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:11,744
have a picture-perfect life,

64
00:04:11,777 --> 00:04:13,145
and she'll try to coerce us
into joining

65
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:14,714
her weird fitness cult.

66
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:17,549
Andy and Roger will screw
because they're bored,

67
00:04:17,582 --> 00:04:19,719
and Zach will cry.

68
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:22,154
Just like old times.

69
00:04:22,188 --> 00:04:24,824
Why am I going, again?

70
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,508
It's three days.

71
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:50,182
Logan?

72
00:04:50,216 --> 00:04:52,985
Logan! Oh my God, Logan!

73
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:56,989
Oh, I missed you so much!

74
00:04:57,023 --> 00:04:59,491
- Hey, Rowan.
- All I do is tell James

75
00:04:59,524 --> 00:05:01,193
how much I want
to come visit you.

76
00:05:01,227 --> 00:05:02,862
- You guys should.
- I wish,

77
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:05,031
but now I've got seven clients
at a time.

78
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:06,699
Every season is wedding season.

79
00:05:06,732 --> 00:05:08,768
I don't remember
the last time we traveled.

80
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:10,535
- Well, you look great.
- Pilates and yoga

81
00:05:10,568 --> 00:05:11,837
three times a week,

82
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:14,606
and I just started
a kickboxing class.

83
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,175
- Wow.
- It wasn't always that easy,

84
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,944
but once I changed my diet,
it's like I have

85
00:05:17,977 --> 00:05:20,545
this entirely different
perspective, you know?

86
00:05:20,578 --> 00:05:21,948
Did you want to join
my company?

87
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:24,684
'Cause it is the best decision
I have ever made.

88
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:26,152
I would love that.

89
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:29,055
Oh, I missed you so much!

90
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:31,190
Okay, you have to catch me up
on everything,

91
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:34,126
you job, dates,
recent TV binges.

92
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,762
- Is anyone else here yet?
- Yeah, it's James and me,

93
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:40,099
uh, and Zach's here, and Andy.

94
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,634
Oh my God!

95
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:43,803
-Oh my God!

96
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:46,238
Oh my God!

97
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:48,506
Holy shit,
I missed you so much!

98
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,810
Oh, look at you, sexy!

99
00:05:50,843 --> 00:05:51,978
Stop, look at your body.

100
00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:54,880
If I had that, I would
literally do everything naked.

101
00:05:54,914 --> 00:05:56,614
Yeah, you'd have to
because my body

102
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:57,817
would never be caught dead
in that.

103
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,784
What the fuck are you wearing?

104
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:01,253
- Stop, I know.
- Seriously, is this a cape?

105
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:02,520
Wait till Gil sees you in that.

106
00:06:02,554 --> 00:06:03,588
He's gonna hate himself.

107
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:04,957
No, I didn't wear this...

108
00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:06,859
- Mm-hm.
- I didn't.

109
00:06:06,892 --> 00:06:07,960
Our lips are sealed,
don't worry.

110
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:10,162
No, before I came up,
I had to stop by the office.

111
00:06:10,196 --> 00:06:11,797
My boss is working
on a double homicide case.

112
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:14,266
- It's so cool.
- I'm bored already.

113
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,168
Come on, I made
some special juice.

114
00:06:16,202 --> 00:06:18,004
We'll go right inside
and enjoy the day.

115
00:06:18,037 --> 00:06:19,939
Andy, it's noon.

116
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:22,208
Let's go, we're behind schedule.

117
00:06:25,044 --> 00:06:26,912
Come on, you're gonna love it.

118
00:06:26,946 --> 00:06:28,647
I'll get the door,
I got it.

119
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,485
...if you guys wanted to,

120
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,286
but you get all these classes
together.

121
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,088
I was helping this other bride
the other week.

122
00:06:36,122 --> 00:06:37,690
She ended up needing
to have to change...

123
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,659
- James!
- Logan.

124
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:42,194
Hi!

125
00:06:42,228 --> 00:06:44,196
- Check my teeth.
- You don't floss enough.

126
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,965
That's so lame, no one does.

127
00:06:45,998 --> 00:06:47,833
It's better than my diagnosis.

128
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:49,769
He told me I have to get
my wisdom teeth pulled out.

129
00:06:49,802 --> 00:06:51,103
If you don't take care
of your teeth,

130
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:52,838
no boys will want to kiss you.

131
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:54,840
And here I thought
you only cared about yourself.

132
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:56,608
How's the new practice going?

133
00:06:56,642 --> 00:06:57,743
It's pretty cool.

134
00:06:57,777 --> 00:06:58,911
I like being my own boss,

135
00:06:58,944 --> 00:07:00,980
and the dental assistants
pretty much do everything.

136
00:07:01,013 --> 00:07:03,816
Can you believe you need to go
to medical school for teeth?

137
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:04,850
You know, you make fun of me,

138
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:06,685
but I had to pass
organic chemistry to get in.

139
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:07,987
- So?
- So I never saw

140
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,821
any party favors.

141
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:10,356
I'm gonna get you back
for that.

142
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,124
- Is that a promise?
- It's a threat.

143
00:07:12,158 --> 00:07:14,060
Oh, that's even better.

144
00:07:16,328 --> 00:07:20,032
Oh, yes, yes, bring them.

145
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:22,301
- What? No.
- Yes.

146
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:25,971
- Shots?
- You're so welcome.

147
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:29,775
All right, guys,
one, two, three.

148
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:35,748
Oh, I should've mixed that.

149
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,710
It was the perfect big wedding.

150
00:08:04,743 --> 00:08:06,879
- Yes, it was.
- Hey!

151
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:08,247
Oh my God!

152
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,183
Hi, Zach!

153
00:08:13,052 --> 00:08:14,386
How are you?
How's your fiancée?

154
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,423
Um, oh, we are drinking already.

155
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:18,724
What are you having, my friend?

156
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:20,960
Um, whatever everyone else
is having.

157
00:08:20,993 --> 00:08:23,896
Bad choice. Andy made
some vile concoction.

158
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:25,231
My special juice.

159
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:27,299
It's a little early
for that, right?

160
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,835
It's never too early
for my special juice.

161
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:40,412
Holy shit.

162
00:08:40,446 --> 00:08:42,982
Roger, is that you?

163
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:44,183
Gil.

164
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:48,721
You look good.

165
00:08:48,754 --> 00:08:49,989
I mean, I hardly
recognized you.

166
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:51,991
Thanks, I joined a Curves.

167
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:53,425
Somehow, you look even better.

168
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,094
Yeah, well, Seattle air.

169
00:08:55,127 --> 00:08:57,463
I had no idea
that air had an impact

170
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,899
on your getup here, sailor.

171
00:08:59,932 --> 00:09:01,367
Yeah, something
you can't afford.

172
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,904
This is gonna be
a long weekend, isn't it?

173
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:07,439
Yeah, yeah, but I...

174
00:09:07,473 --> 00:09:12,211
I brought drugs and alcohol
to numb.

175
00:09:12,244 --> 00:09:14,413
Of course you did.

176
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:22,254
All right.

177
00:09:22,288 --> 00:09:24,156
Oh, fuck!

178
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:26,458
That was... that was good.

179
00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:28,327
Right here, right here.

180
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,929
- Eyes here.
- Hey!

181
00:09:29,962 --> 00:09:31,163
See what happens
if you listen to me?

182
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:32,331
You see what happens?

183
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:40,105
- So why defense?
- I don't know.

184
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:41,907
It seemed like more
of a challenge, I guess.

185
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:43,809
- Is it?
- Very.

186
00:09:43,842 --> 00:09:47,112
Yeah, my first case,
he was like a serial rapist.

187
00:09:47,146 --> 00:09:48,447
- Yeah, he was a dick.
- I bet.

188
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,915
Did you prove him innocent?

189
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:51,517
Can't lose your first case.

190
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,153
- God, I could never do that.
- Oh, you monster.

191
00:09:54,186 --> 00:09:55,020
You don't have a choice.

192
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:58,123
They teach you
to become indifferent.

193
00:09:58,157 --> 00:10:00,259
It's not... whatever.

194
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:02,928
- Enjoying yourself?
- Yes, I am, thank you.

195
00:10:02,962 --> 00:10:05,197
Great. You want to take
my pills too?

196
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:07,399
They're in the other pocket
if you want.

197
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:09,068
Nothing gets past you,
does it?

198
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:11,003
- You have pills?
- Yeah,

199
00:10:11,036 --> 00:10:12,504
but they're prescription,
it's all good.

200
00:10:12,538 --> 00:10:15,107
- What is it this month?
- Aw, it's endless.

201
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,810
- Could be worse.
- Yeah, could be worse.

202
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:21,146
Don't look at me like that.

203
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,214
I didn't say anything.

204
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:24,850
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

205
00:10:24,883 --> 00:10:27,453
- All right, give me this.
- Come and get it.

206
00:10:27,486 --> 00:10:29,455
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hm.

207
00:10:29,488 --> 00:10:30,923
Grow up, Andy.

208
00:10:30,956 --> 00:10:32,124
Mm, no.

209
00:10:32,157 --> 00:10:34,193
Stop.

210
00:10:34,226 --> 00:10:35,995
Logan, take it, take it!

211
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:38,030
Oh my God. Oh my God,
leave me out of this!

212
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:40,165
- Leave me out of this!
- Give me my fucking weed!

213
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:41,333
- No, no, no, no!
- Give it back.

214
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:43,902
Stop, ah!

215
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:48,173
Don't pick on a girl. No.

216
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:49,208
It's not fair.

217
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:51,277
Ah, well.

218
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,280
Oh, yes.

219
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:55,581
Happy?

220
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,182
Yeah, actually.

221
00:10:57,216 --> 00:10:58,284
Pretty happy.

222
00:10:58,317 --> 00:11:00,185
Not gonna lie.

223
00:11:01,854 --> 00:11:04,857
Oh my God, you still have this?

224
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,826
Yeah, obviously,
it's awesome.

225
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,762
Does that make me a loser?

226
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,329
- Is that lame?
- I mean, it kind of does.

227
00:11:10,362 --> 00:11:12,498
No fucking way!

228
00:11:12,531 --> 00:11:14,033
That looks like shit.

229
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:15,367
- What did you do to it?
- You fucking made it!

230
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:16,235
Walk through the valley

231
00:11:16,268 --> 00:11:17,970
of the shadow of death
in that thing.

232
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:19,405
Mine looks good.

233
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:22,341
That was really bad.

234
00:11:22,374 --> 00:11:23,442
It's fine.

235
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:26,345
Watch this, babe.

236
00:11:26,378 --> 00:11:27,379
Here it is.

237
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,555
I told you not to call me.

238
00:11:36,588 --> 00:11:38,924
Come on, Gil.

239
00:11:38,957 --> 00:11:42,161
Right, I know,
but he is my husband.

240
00:11:42,194 --> 00:11:43,362
We're fine, we're fine.

241
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:46,532
Yeah, I...

242
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:48,934
I know.

243
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:50,637
Yeah, I promise.

244
00:11:52,471 --> 00:11:56,175
Can you just hang tight
for me, please?

245
00:11:57,677 --> 00:11:59,011
All right.

246
00:11:59,044 --> 00:12:00,446
I got to go.

247
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:02,915
No one saw that.

248
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:06,418
Boom!

249
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:09,154
Fuck you! In your mouth!

250
00:12:11,323 --> 00:12:13,292
Gil, it's not as fun

251
00:12:13,325 --> 00:12:14,560
if you're not
a sore loser about it.

252
00:12:14,593 --> 00:12:15,628
Good job, man.

253
00:12:15,662 --> 00:12:16,895
What?

254
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:18,097
Where the fuck are you going?

255
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,633
Gonna go collect
my consolation prize.

256
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:24,136
You know, you didn't win, Gil!

257
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:25,237
This is crazy.

258
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,372
- I'm good.
- Yeah?

259
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:28,040
- Yeah.
- Logan.

260
00:12:28,073 --> 00:12:29,608
Hey.

261
00:12:29,642 --> 00:12:30,576
- What?
- Let's go.

262
00:12:30,609 --> 00:12:32,679
What? Hey.

263
00:12:32,712 --> 00:12:34,146
No!

264
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:35,581
Put me down!

265
00:12:35,614 --> 00:12:38,417
No, I was talking to Roger.

266
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,985
I don't... stop running.

267
00:12:40,018 --> 00:12:42,087
- You need some Gil time.
- Oh, no, no, no, no!

268
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:43,555
Don't throw me in the lake!

269
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:46,392
Now another installment of
America's favorite game show,

270
00:12:46,425 --> 00:12:49,027
Will He Do It?

271
00:12:51,296 --> 00:12:52,965
Stop.

272
00:12:52,998 --> 00:12:55,702
No, stop. Stop.

273
00:12:55,735 --> 00:12:57,536
Boo! Throw her in the lake!

274
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,372
I want to see betrayal!

275
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:03,409
I remember
when we were that cute.

276
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:05,077
Were?

277
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,946
Did you get your joint back?

278
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,048
James, stop,
what are you doing?

279
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:12,951
- I'm being cute.
- James!

280
00:13:12,985 --> 00:13:14,319
I swear to God, put me down.

281
00:13:14,353 --> 00:13:16,689
- I will divorce you!
- Freedom!

282
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:21,293
Race you down the dock?

283
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,268
- Come on.
- No, I can't.

284
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:31,170
You want the girl or not, dude?

285
00:13:31,203 --> 00:13:32,504
Come on.

286
00:13:37,543 --> 00:13:39,311
Gil! No!

287
00:13:39,344 --> 00:13:40,279
Gil!

288
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:45,350
Babe, get in the water!

289
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,261
Zach!

290
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:01,433
Guys, guys, guys,
he doesn't have to come in

291
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:02,669
if he doesn't want to.

292
00:14:02,702 --> 00:14:03,703
All right, but at least
let me out

293
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:06,238
'cause I don't want
to be in here anymore.

294
00:14:13,345 --> 00:14:14,513
Woo!

295
00:14:14,546 --> 00:14:16,415
Zachie boy!

296
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,686
Stop it.

297
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:44,737
So, I guess I'll start
with the awkward catch-ups

298
00:15:44,771 --> 00:15:47,205
and where are we nows?

299
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,876
I'm currently working
at Bar Louie still

300
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:52,477
and I'm not serving, though.

301
00:15:52,511 --> 00:15:54,847
I am actually the bartender,

302
00:15:54,881 --> 00:15:57,215
and I get to plan the events
sometimes,

303
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:58,785
- which is pretty cool.
- Doesn't it suck

304
00:15:58,818 --> 00:16:00,019
still living up there, though?

305
00:16:00,053 --> 00:16:03,823
Um, sometimes, but I still get
to go to the football games

306
00:16:03,856 --> 00:16:05,692
and the bars are dirt cheap.

307
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:07,593
Why did you spend
thousands of dollars

308
00:16:07,627 --> 00:16:09,294
on a criminology degree again?

309
00:16:09,328 --> 00:16:11,597
Oh, okay,
probably the same reason

310
00:16:11,631 --> 00:16:14,867
you took that bullshit PR job
that you didn't want.

311
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:17,837
I actually got fired
from that bullshit PR job,

312
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,371
so I really wish
I had it right now.

313
00:16:19,404 --> 00:16:21,173
Seriously? When?

314
00:16:21,206 --> 00:16:23,141
Uh, maybe a month ago.

315
00:16:23,175 --> 00:16:25,177
How did Zoey take it?

316
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,145
Oh, yeah.

317
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:28,380
I guess I should
tell you guys.

318
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:30,482
Um, she's gone, she left me.

319
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:32,351
- Wait, what?
- Yeah,

320
00:16:32,384 --> 00:16:34,586
maybe like three weeks ago.

321
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,722
I can't really remember.

322
00:16:35,755 --> 00:16:37,456
Oh, Zach.

323
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:39,759
- Damn, dude.
- Yeah, seriously bad timing.

324
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,593
I was just pissed
she kept the ring.

325
00:16:41,628 --> 00:16:43,462
Cost me a fortune.

326
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:44,797
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

327
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:46,365
none of us
really liked her anyway.

328
00:16:46,398 --> 00:16:48,768
That does, that does.

329
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:50,837
That seriously pisses me off.

330
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,572
I say we track her down,
then kill her.

331
00:16:53,605 --> 00:16:57,744
Normally, I'm not with this,
but I say we just kill her.

332
00:16:57,777 --> 00:16:59,511
How about this? I'll counter.

333
00:16:59,544 --> 00:17:02,581
I'll allow a light keying
of the car I bought her.

334
00:17:02,614 --> 00:17:05,550
- Yay!
- For you, I'll do it.

335
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:07,452
Do a good job.

336
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:09,554
But enough about me
and my misfortunes.

337
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:11,289
Someone else go,
something lighter,

338
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:14,359
something happier.

339
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:16,495
Unless you all can top
my misery, I mean...

340
00:17:16,528 --> 00:17:18,296
- Ooh, I can.
- Logan.

341
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,700
Okay, my fiancé left me
five years ago

342
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:22,501
and now he's sitting
across from me,

343
00:17:22,534 --> 00:17:25,504
so I think
that tops yours easily.

344
00:17:25,537 --> 00:17:27,640
- Wow.
- What?

345
00:17:27,674 --> 00:17:28,741
It always comes back to this,
doesn't it?

346
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:30,910
- Comes back to what?
- It's been less than four hours

347
00:17:30,943 --> 00:17:31,844
and you're already
starting shit.

348
00:17:31,878 --> 00:17:34,446
- I'm just stating the truth.
- I moved

349
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:36,381
for a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

350
00:17:36,415 --> 00:17:38,751
- You refused to come.
- You never invited me.

351
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:40,352
Yeah, well, it looks like
you're doing pretty well

352
00:17:40,385 --> 00:17:41,353
for yourself.

353
00:17:41,386 --> 00:17:44,256
I saw your posts of Fiji.

354
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:45,725
And what is that
supposed to mean?

355
00:17:45,758 --> 00:17:47,760
It means that you can afford
something like that.

356
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:49,494
The trip,
your designer clothing,

357
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:50,897
that watch you're trying
to show off right now.

358
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:51,631
James and I are trying
to have...

359
00:17:51,664 --> 00:17:52,999
You really didn't even need me.

360
00:17:53,032 --> 00:17:54,967
- Here we go.
- Well,

361
00:17:55,001 --> 00:17:56,703
when you attend Yale University,

362
00:17:56,736 --> 00:17:58,771
ranked number one
in the United States,

363
00:17:58,805 --> 00:18:01,506
and you are number four
of your graduating class,

364
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,443
you tend to get offered
really well-paying jobs

365
00:18:04,476 --> 00:18:07,412
that give you money
to go on said trips

366
00:18:07,446 --> 00:18:08,948
and to buy said
designer clothing

367
00:18:08,981 --> 00:18:11,851
and my $3,000 watch.

368
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:12,952
You spent three grand?

369
00:18:12,985 --> 00:18:15,988
Yes, I did, Zach.

370
00:18:16,022 --> 00:18:17,757
So while you're still
a fucking intern

371
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,860
up to his elbows in bedpans
and sutures,

372
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:24,329
I am standing comfortably
six to eight hours a day

373
00:18:24,362 --> 00:18:25,932
in my Louis Vuittons.

374
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,401
Did I adequately answer

375
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:32,604
your condescending
question, Gil?

376
00:18:32,638 --> 00:18:33,940
I did?

377
00:18:33,973 --> 00:18:35,775
Okay.

378
00:18:41,013 --> 00:18:42,982
So are you still
mainly cardio...

379
00:18:43,015 --> 00:18:44,784
Are you still a has-been
English lit professor

380
00:18:44,817 --> 00:18:46,986
that sleeps with his TAs?

381
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:48,988
What?

382
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:50,022
You do.

383
00:18:50,056 --> 00:18:53,358
Oh, Zach, what?

384
00:18:53,391 --> 00:18:55,594
Five times.

385
00:18:55,628 --> 00:18:57,529
Uh, me and Rowan
are trying to have a baby.

386
00:18:57,562 --> 00:19:00,432
Hey!

387
00:19:00,465 --> 00:19:02,400
- Congrats.
- Thanks, guys.

388
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:04,402
I can't believe you guys
are starting a family.

389
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:06,571
Yeah, I'm super stoked
to be a father.

390
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:07,974
We already got the top names
picked out,

391
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:09,809
and I'm gonna build
the crib myself.

392
00:19:09,842 --> 00:19:11,409
- Nice.
- We can totally plan

393
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,311
the baby shower, gender reveal,

394
00:19:13,345 --> 00:19:14,046
whatever you guys need.

395
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,547
Slow down.

396
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,616
He said we were trying.

397
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,652
There's no baby.

398
00:19:19,685 --> 00:19:21,620
Not yet.

399
00:19:25,091 --> 00:19:28,593
- I'm gonna head to bed.
- It's, like, 9:00.

400
00:19:28,628 --> 00:19:29,929
- Dude.
- What?

401
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:31,764
Are you really about to leave
without telling us?

402
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:32,965
What are you talking about?

403
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:34,466
Why you brought us here.

404
00:19:34,499 --> 00:19:35,668
The suspense is killing me.

405
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:36,869
Yeah, Gil.

406
00:19:36,903 --> 00:19:38,905
- What?
- The letter.

407
00:19:38,938 --> 00:19:41,339
The weird letter,
you said you had some big news

408
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:42,541
and to come up
to your lake house.

409
00:19:42,574 --> 00:19:45,044
- What are you talking about?
- Dude, this is not my house.

410
00:19:45,077 --> 00:19:47,445
- What?
- I received a letter from Logan.

411
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,048
- Logan?
- Wait, what?

412
00:19:49,081 --> 00:19:51,784
Your letter,
it's in my jacket pocket.

413
00:19:51,818 --> 00:19:53,385
Letter? No, no, no.

414
00:19:53,418 --> 00:19:55,620
No, no, I got a letter
and it was from Andy.

415
00:19:55,655 --> 00:19:58,390
No. No, I... that's impossible.

416
00:19:58,423 --> 00:19:59,926
I got mine from Zach.

417
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:01,661
I got mine from Roger.

418
00:20:01,694 --> 00:20:04,396
Mine is from Logan, so...

419
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:05,998
Wait, so none of
anyone's letters

420
00:20:06,032 --> 00:20:07,800
- are from James and I?
- Babe, I don't think

421
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:09,068
that's the big issue here.

422
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:11,938
No, but admit
it's a little strange.

423
00:20:23,582 --> 00:20:25,685
"Hey, long time, no talk,
stranger.

424
00:20:25,718 --> 00:20:26,551
I miss you."

425
00:20:26,585 --> 00:20:27,419
"I know it's probably
last minute

426
00:20:27,452 --> 00:20:28,486
and asking a lot,
but I'd love it

427
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,023
if you could make it
to my lake house next weekend."

428
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:32,758
"Oh, yeah, did I tell you
I bought a lake house?

429
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:34,559
- It's insane."
- "Anyways,

430
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:36,062
I invited everyone
from the group up.

431
00:20:36,095 --> 00:20:38,664
I have big, big news
for you all."

432
00:20:38,698 --> 00:20:41,000
"But I better not spoil
anything.

433
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:42,668
It's gonna be
a hell of a weekend."

434
00:20:42,702 --> 00:20:43,836
"Hope to see you there.

435
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,038
Bring lots of booze.

436
00:20:46,072 --> 00:20:47,039
Yours truly..."

437
00:20:47,073 --> 00:20:48,473
- "Roger."
- "Zach."

438
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:51,610
What is going on?

439
00:20:51,644 --> 00:20:52,678
Okay, it's probably
just the storm.

440
00:20:52,712 --> 00:20:54,847
- James.
- I'm right here.

441
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:57,415
Check your phones for service,
you guys got anything?

442
00:20:57,449 --> 00:20:58,718
Guys, it's probably
just the storm.

443
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,485
Would you stop saying that?

444
00:21:00,518 --> 00:21:02,520
Oh my God, it's a fucking ghost.

445
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:04,456
This house is haunted and...

446
00:21:04,489 --> 00:21:06,591
Andy, get yourself together.
Ghosts aren't real.

447
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,460
Then who wrote us
the fucking letter, Gil?

448
00:21:08,493 --> 00:21:10,462
Maybe something with fucking
hands to write it with?

449
00:21:10,495 --> 00:21:12,064
It has to be someone
we knew in school.

450
00:21:12,098 --> 00:21:13,900
James, we literally had
zero other friends.

451
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:15,533
Yeah, they wanted in the group,
we didn't let them in,

452
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:16,636
and now they've been
holding a grudge

453
00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:18,104
and pulling off this shit.

454
00:21:18,137 --> 00:21:19,571
James, that could never happen.

455
00:21:19,604 --> 00:21:21,674
- Nobody liked us.
- Or...

456
00:21:21,707 --> 00:21:23,743
Or it's just one of us
playing a prank,

457
00:21:23,776 --> 00:21:25,711
and if they are,
they've got us really good

458
00:21:25,745 --> 00:21:28,180
and they should totally
just come forward right now!

459
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:31,483
My vote is still on the ghost.

460
00:21:31,516 --> 00:21:33,485
Andy, ghosts aren't real.

461
00:21:33,518 --> 00:21:34,854
Whose fucking house is this?

462
00:21:34,887 --> 00:21:37,056
Everybody, calm down. Relax.

463
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:39,959
Way too fucking high
for this right now.

464
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,028
All right, ladies, stay here.

465
00:21:42,061 --> 00:21:44,063
Me and Gil are gonna
check things out in the front.

466
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:46,666
Zach and Roger, you guys see
what's going on in the barn.

467
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:48,868
- What?
- Let's go.

468
00:21:48,901 --> 00:21:50,602
Let's go.

469
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:54,774
"Let's go."

470
00:21:54,807 --> 00:21:56,574
- You ready?
- Yeah.

471
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,733
Dude, this place is huge.

472
00:22:22,735 --> 00:22:25,104
Dude, I'm convinced
we only stayed friends with them

473
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:26,939
- for the girls.
- What do you mean?

474
00:22:26,973 --> 00:22:28,174
I mean,
have you heard them talk?

475
00:22:28,207 --> 00:22:29,541
It makes me want
to kill myself.

476
00:22:29,574 --> 00:22:31,110
That's a given.
Whenever Gil talks,

477
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:34,213
I want to slit my wrists
with shards of glass.

478
00:22:34,246 --> 00:22:36,082
What do you mean
"for the girls"?

479
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,122
Wow.

480
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:44,857
Uh, you know,
I mean the girls.

481
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,158
You were always into Logan.

482
00:22:46,192 --> 00:22:47,760
I was into Andy.

483
00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:49,795
They came as a package deal,
I mean.

484
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:52,932
No, dude, I never liked Logan.

485
00:22:52,965 --> 00:22:54,900
You're such an asshole.

486
00:22:54,934 --> 00:22:56,669
I'm just saying I think
we could've spared ourselves

487
00:22:56,702 --> 00:22:59,105
a lot of unnecessary
memories with them

488
00:22:59,138 --> 00:23:00,940
- if we just dealt with that.
- Yeah,

489
00:23:00,973 --> 00:23:03,275
but then you wouldn't get
to tell all these stories.

490
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:06,645
Oh, yeah, right,
the ones I love telling.

491
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:08,781
This is actually pretty nuts,
dude.

492
00:23:08,814 --> 00:23:10,049
We should bring
everybody in here.

493
00:23:10,082 --> 00:23:12,752
- This place is massive.
- It's not small.

494
00:23:12,785 --> 00:23:15,154
Basketball hoop too.

495
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:16,789
I should get everybody
in here, dude.

496
00:23:16,822 --> 00:23:18,257
Insane.

497
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:22,094
Oh, fuck.

498
00:23:23,896 --> 00:23:25,631
Oh, shit.

499
00:23:27,366 --> 00:23:29,201
Dude.

500
00:23:32,972 --> 00:23:36,308
- So we're stranded here?
- At least until morning.

501
00:23:36,342 --> 00:23:38,610
Great, so there could be
a psychopath trying to kill us

502
00:23:38,644 --> 00:23:40,578
and there's nothing
any of us can do about it.

503
00:23:40,612 --> 00:23:42,048
It's a small house, Rowan.

504
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:45,051
I think we'd notice
the eighth unidentifiable person

505
00:23:45,084 --> 00:23:46,252
lurking in the shadows.

506
00:23:46,285 --> 00:23:48,054
He could be lurking outside.

507
00:23:48,087 --> 00:23:49,288
You don't know.

508
00:23:49,321 --> 00:23:51,357
First of all,
it could be a woman.

509
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,793
Let's not undermine
psychotic women,

510
00:23:53,826 --> 00:23:55,661
because they're fucking nuts.

511
00:23:55,694 --> 00:23:57,963
Secondly, it's cold
and wet outside.

512
00:23:57,997 --> 00:23:59,131
None of us are
interesting enough

513
00:23:59,165 --> 00:24:01,734
to have a personal vendetta
against us.

514
00:24:01,767 --> 00:24:03,069
It's not a psychopath.

515
00:24:03,102 --> 00:24:04,003
All right, let's go back.

516
00:24:04,036 --> 00:24:05,805
Does anyone remember
who got here first?

517
00:24:05,838 --> 00:24:07,339
It was me.

518
00:24:07,373 --> 00:24:08,374
Um.

519
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:11,343
No, fuck. Uh, maybe Zach?

520
00:24:11,377 --> 00:24:12,812
- I don't know.
- Look, I think we should

521
00:24:12,845 --> 00:24:13,813
just call the police.

522
00:24:13,846 --> 00:24:15,781
There's no service, remember?

523
00:24:15,815 --> 00:24:18,050
All of these
are in different handwritings.

524
00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:20,352
Do you think it means anything?

525
00:24:20,386 --> 00:24:22,354
Does it mean anything, Logan?

526
00:24:22,388 --> 00:24:24,323
I don't know,
I'm not a detective.

527
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:26,292
You're the next closest thing.

528
00:24:26,325 --> 00:24:27,726
You're always bragging
about Yale,

529
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,994
so why don't you start thinking?

530
00:24:29,028 --> 00:24:30,763
God, Rowan, why are you
such a bitch?

531
00:24:30,796 --> 00:24:33,099
Why are you
such a fucking ditz?

532
00:24:33,132 --> 00:24:35,267
All right, shut the fuck up!

533
00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:38,337
You guys need to come see this.

534
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:41,173
We need to get out
of this house.

535
00:24:59,191 --> 00:25:02,228
So, should we, like, take bets

536
00:25:02,261 --> 00:25:05,297
on who's gonna get
fucking axed first?

537
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:08,367
Anyone?

538
00:25:10,002 --> 00:25:12,271
My money, definitely on Gil.

539
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:15,007
Like, he would make me.

540
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,375
Not if I sacrifice you first.

541
00:25:16,408 --> 00:25:18,310
All right, this isn't
funny anymore, you guys.

542
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:19,178
Somebody, come clean.

543
00:25:19,211 --> 00:25:21,147
Rowan, we are all
a little bit sick,

544
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,083
but nobody is that demented.

545
00:25:24,116 --> 00:25:25,851
What does this even mean?

546
00:25:25,885 --> 00:25:27,186
What secrets
is it talking about?

547
00:25:27,219 --> 00:25:29,255
I mean, we did
our senior year.

548
00:25:29,288 --> 00:25:30,289
Oh, that's got to be it.

549
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:33,192
Something tells me
this is a little more major.

550
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:36,896
You know, some secrets exist
to protect other people...

551
00:25:40,733 --> 00:25:42,434
...to protect yourself.

552
00:25:42,468 --> 00:25:44,803
Andy?

553
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:48,040
Whoever wrote that is
seriously fucked in the head!

554
00:25:59,385 --> 00:26:00,319
- That's blood.
- So what do we do

555
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:02,855
because we can't leave here

556
00:26:02,888 --> 00:26:05,357
and we can't call somebody
for help.

557
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:08,727
And we obviously can't hide
from whatever it is.

558
00:26:08,761 --> 00:26:10,896
Whoever it is.

559
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,464
Right.

560
00:26:14,433 --> 00:26:16,502
So we drink.

561
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:18,337
- Seriously?
- What?

562
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,172
I mean, this is
supposed to be a vacation.

563
00:26:20,206 --> 00:26:21,207
I haven't seen you guys
in years.

564
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,775
I don't know
when I'm gonna see you again.

565
00:26:22,808 --> 00:26:23,809
We might as well have some fun

566
00:26:23,842 --> 00:26:28,147
until the demons take over
or whatever, right?

567
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,152
Guys, you saw how Andy acted.

568
00:26:33,185 --> 00:26:37,156
How is us not being calm
going to help the situation?

569
00:26:42,061 --> 00:26:43,162
Okay, if we're still
placing bets,

570
00:26:43,195 --> 00:26:45,197
my vote is on Zach.

571
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:12,992
- You all right?
- Yeah, I just can't sleep.

572
00:27:13,025 --> 00:27:16,262
- Need a distraction?
- That depends.

573
00:27:18,297 --> 00:27:20,165
James, stop.

574
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:22,201
What are you trying to do?

575
00:27:22,234 --> 00:27:23,168
Trying to make a baby.

576
00:27:23,202 --> 00:27:25,137
What's it look like
I'm trying to do?

577
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:28,007
Babe, maybe we should take
a break, all right?

578
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,408
Something weird is going on.

579
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:31,210
These are not our sheets.

580
00:27:31,243 --> 00:27:33,545
No, no breaks.

581
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:35,914
I want to do this.

582
00:27:35,948 --> 00:27:38,817
For you, for us.

583
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:40,452
I want this for us too.

584
00:27:40,486 --> 00:27:42,121
I don't want to fail you.

585
00:27:42,154 --> 00:27:44,857
You're not failing me.

586
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,059
I feel like I am.

587
00:27:47,092 --> 00:27:48,360
Babe.

588
00:27:48,394 --> 00:27:50,996
The doctor said
when you're ovulating,

589
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,898
that's when it's gonna work.

590
00:27:52,931 --> 00:27:54,833
I'm on top of this.

591
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:56,468
I know your cycle by heart.

592
00:27:56,502 --> 00:27:58,037
It's important.

593
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,172
It's important to us.

594
00:28:00,205 --> 00:28:03,208
So we have to try
extra hard this week.

595
00:28:05,878 --> 00:28:07,846
I promise I can do this.

596
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,881
And I want to have a baby
with you

597
00:28:08,914 --> 00:28:11,450
more than anything
in the world.

598
00:28:16,288 --> 00:28:18,290
Okay.

599
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:20,025
We'll keep trying.

600
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:22,361
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

601
00:28:32,037 --> 00:28:34,940
If I ask to go to the bathroom
really quick,

602
00:28:34,973 --> 00:28:37,910
will that kill the mood?

603
00:28:37,943 --> 00:28:39,578
Yes.

604
00:28:39,611 --> 00:28:42,381
I mean no, you're fine,
just go.

605
00:28:42,414 --> 00:28:44,483
I'm sorry.

606
00:29:55,521 --> 00:29:58,524
- Gil?
- Mm.

607
00:29:58,557 --> 00:30:00,426
It's got to be one of us.

608
00:30:00,459 --> 00:30:02,094
- I just know it's one of...
- Babe...

609
00:30:04,363 --> 00:30:05,632
Well, I was just thinking
about it and...

610
00:30:05,665 --> 00:30:08,500
Yeah, I know you do that a lot.

611
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,071
You all right?

612
00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:14,573
Yeah.

613
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:17,409
All right, so come back
to bed, please.

614
00:30:26,251 --> 00:30:28,721
- Better?
- Yeah.

615
00:30:30,489 --> 00:30:31,758
Good.

616
00:30:37,697 --> 00:30:40,232
- I mean, there was...
- For God's sake, Logan.

617
00:30:40,265 --> 00:30:42,034
Why is no one else
freaking out about this?

618
00:30:42,067 --> 00:30:44,036
Because, honestly,
it's just a dumb prank.

619
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:45,170
- A prank?
- Yeah.

620
00:30:45,204 --> 00:30:47,339
Roger is weird like that.

621
00:30:47,372 --> 00:30:48,741
What did you just say?

622
00:31:22,074 --> 00:31:23,776
Oh, no, no, no.

623
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:36,656
Oh, no, no, no.

624
00:31:48,835 --> 00:31:50,536
Fuck!

625
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:52,672
Fuck.

626
00:31:52,705 --> 00:31:54,741
It was all right here.

627
00:31:54,774 --> 00:31:56,308
Okay, okay.

628
00:31:56,341 --> 00:31:57,677
Roger this, Roger that.

629
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,344
It's always been
about fucking Roger.

630
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:02,281
I am just simply asking you
why you're accusing him.

631
00:32:02,314 --> 00:32:03,683
- That's all.
- And I'm simply asking you

632
00:32:03,716 --> 00:32:04,583
why are you defending him?

633
00:32:04,616 --> 00:32:05,818
I'm not.

634
00:32:05,852 --> 00:32:07,486
Yes, you are.

635
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,422
Would you just answer
the question?

636
00:32:10,455 --> 00:32:11,323
Don't drill me like that.

637
00:32:11,356 --> 00:32:13,191
- Like what?
- Like one of your clients.

638
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:15,527
Oh, see, I'm nice
to my clients.

639
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:16,328
I like my clients.

640
00:32:16,361 --> 00:32:18,130
- I don't like you.
- Oh, yeah?

641
00:32:18,163 --> 00:32:19,598
You like murderers and rapists
more than me?

642
00:32:19,632 --> 00:32:21,199
Yes.

643
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:22,635
No.

644
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:23,770
I don't know.
You're frustrating me.

645
00:32:23,803 --> 00:32:26,238
All right, just wait.

646
00:32:26,271 --> 00:32:27,406
Roger is a dick.

647
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:30,309
I can just see him pulling
a dumb dick prank like this

648
00:32:30,342 --> 00:32:31,443
and then the surprise

649
00:32:31,476 --> 00:32:33,780
is that he's in rehab
or something.

650
00:32:33,813 --> 00:32:36,481
Just get back to bed, please.

651
00:32:36,515 --> 00:32:37,684
No.

652
00:32:37,717 --> 00:32:39,117
What is wrong with you?
What did I do?

653
00:32:39,151 --> 00:32:39,819
Do you want a list?

654
00:32:39,852 --> 00:32:41,353
Stop being so fucking stubborn.

655
00:32:41,386 --> 00:32:44,222
Then stop being
a total fucking prick.

656
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,458
Are you serious?

657
00:32:46,491 --> 00:32:47,526
What? That always used to work.

658
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:49,328
God, you are unreal.

659
00:32:49,361 --> 00:32:50,897
You are...

660
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,165
...unreal.

661
00:32:53,198 --> 00:32:55,400
Logan...

662
00:33:00,807 --> 00:33:03,643
- Hey.
- Hey.

663
00:33:03,676 --> 00:33:04,777
Do you mind if I join you?

664
00:33:04,811 --> 00:33:06,578
Yeah, of course.

665
00:33:10,582 --> 00:33:13,686
Listen, I'm sorry about before.

666
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,388
- It's okay.
- No, I freaked out.

667
00:33:16,421 --> 00:33:18,190
Well, yeah, I mean,
something weird is going on.

668
00:33:18,223 --> 00:33:19,391
You had every right to.

669
00:33:19,424 --> 00:33:21,828
Yeah, but that's not me.

670
00:33:21,861 --> 00:33:23,595
I'm Andy, I'm the fun one.

671
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,632
And I'm Zach, I'm the loser.

672
00:33:25,665 --> 00:33:27,834
- The ables are overrated.
- You're not a loser.

673
00:33:27,867 --> 00:33:29,201
You're perfect.

674
00:33:34,272 --> 00:33:36,208
Can I ask you something?

675
00:33:36,241 --> 00:33:37,609
Anything.

676
00:33:40,545 --> 00:33:44,416
Uh, why Roger?

677
00:33:44,449 --> 00:33:46,251
I mean, you could've had
any guy you wanted

678
00:33:46,284 --> 00:33:50,389
back in college and I know
that you still could, so...

679
00:33:50,422 --> 00:33:53,325
I don't know, um...

680
00:33:53,358 --> 00:33:57,664
He's funny, uh,
he always had weed

681
00:33:57,697 --> 00:33:59,498
which, you know
I enjoy so much,

682
00:33:59,531 --> 00:34:01,701
and he was only interested
in the sex,

683
00:34:01,734 --> 00:34:03,736
so clearly my type.

684
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,672
Why do you ask?

685
00:34:05,705 --> 00:34:08,841
I was... I was, uh, curious.

686
00:34:09,976 --> 00:34:12,712
Just be glad you never
messed around in the group.

687
00:34:12,745 --> 00:34:15,782
Complicated things.

688
00:34:15,815 --> 00:34:17,850
Mm, tell me about it.

689
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:21,386
Wait a minute. Did you ever?

690
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,454
- Oh my gosh.
- No.

691
00:34:22,487 --> 00:34:24,322
- Who?
- No.

692
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:26,859
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not.

693
00:34:26,893 --> 00:34:29,261
Swear?

694
00:34:29,294 --> 00:34:30,663
I swear.

695
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,740
Want to go to bed?

696
00:34:49,749 --> 00:34:54,619
Um, um, I'm gonna stay
with my beer, actually.

697
00:34:54,654 --> 00:34:57,023
You head on up.

698
00:34:57,056 --> 00:34:58,323
Okay.

699
00:34:58,356 --> 00:35:00,292
- Goodnight, then.
- Goodnight.

700
00:35:25,985 --> 00:35:28,453
Fuck.

701
00:35:39,598 --> 00:35:41,533
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

702
00:35:41,566 --> 00:35:44,003
Yeah, well, you did, so...

703
00:35:49,574 --> 00:35:50,843
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

704
00:35:50,877 --> 00:35:53,012
- You look terrible.
- I'm fine.

705
00:35:53,045 --> 00:35:54,781
- Roger...
- Andy, I can't do this

706
00:35:54,814 --> 00:35:56,749
right now, we can't... it's not
gonna happen.

707
00:35:56,783 --> 00:35:58,885
- Dude, what?
- This. Us. Sex.

708
00:35:58,918 --> 00:35:59,986
Okay, it's not... it's not
gonna happen.

709
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:01,988
What makes you think
that's what I came in here for?

710
00:36:02,021 --> 00:36:04,556
Isn't it, though? That's what
you always come in here for.

711
00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:06,591
It's after midnight.

712
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:08,493
You're bored,
I'm just... I'm here.

713
00:36:08,527 --> 00:36:11,998
Wow, okay. So that's
what you think about me.

714
00:36:12,031 --> 00:36:14,399
Just get out, okay?

715
00:36:14,432 --> 00:36:15,802
What the hell happened to you?

716
00:36:15,835 --> 00:36:18,603
I grew up, Andy!

717
00:36:18,638 --> 00:36:22,041
Just, please, just get out.

718
00:36:22,074 --> 00:36:23,475
Please.

719
00:36:23,508 --> 00:36:25,011
Just get out.

720
00:36:38,057 --> 00:36:40,960
- Don't talk to me.
- Nothing happened.

721
00:36:40,993 --> 00:36:42,695
Fuck.

722
00:36:46,632 --> 00:36:48,400
- You scared me.
- Yeah, well,

723
00:36:48,433 --> 00:36:50,602
you scared me, so...

724
00:36:50,636 --> 00:36:51,971
- Hey, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

725
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:55,507
- Let me look at you.
- I'm fine, okay?

726
00:37:09,889 --> 00:37:11,623
Be sane, girl.

727
00:37:11,657 --> 00:37:14,694
Lock your door.

728
00:37:14,727 --> 00:37:17,462
Okay.

729
00:38:22,828 --> 00:38:25,831
Help, help, help me.

730
00:38:25,865 --> 00:38:27,099
Help me, help.

731
00:38:29,835 --> 00:38:31,904
Help.

732
00:38:31,938 --> 00:38:33,639
Help me.

733
00:39:15,982 --> 00:39:17,283
Help me!

734
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:31,130
Ow, ow.

735
00:39:31,163 --> 00:39:32,732
Ow, help me.

736
00:39:32,765 --> 00:39:34,599
Help me, ow, ow.

737
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:36,534
Help me, help me, help me.

738
00:39:36,568 --> 00:39:38,070
Help.

739
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:45,711
Help me.

740
00:39:45,745 --> 00:39:46,979
Help.

741
00:39:47,013 --> 00:39:48,580
Help me, help me.

742
00:39:48,613 --> 00:39:49,949
Help me.

743
00:39:51,317 --> 00:39:52,251
Help me!

744
00:39:52,284 --> 00:39:54,020
Help me! Help me!

745
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:01,260
Zach, are you okay?

746
00:40:01,293 --> 00:40:03,829
I'm fine.

747
00:40:03,863 --> 00:40:05,064
-I'm fine.

748
00:40:53,879 --> 00:40:57,016
Mm, good morning, sunshine.

749
00:40:57,049 --> 00:40:59,318
Hey, how's it going?

750
00:40:59,351 --> 00:41:00,352
You look like shit.

751
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:04,657
- Do you want some pancakes?
- Sure.

752
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,358
They're just made.

753
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:14,166
Drugs, day two.
Day two, doing drugs.

754
00:41:19,905 --> 00:41:21,941
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, no, I just, uh,

755
00:41:21,974 --> 00:41:23,809
I didn't sleep much last night.

756
00:41:23,843 --> 00:41:24,944
Do you want me
to make you some coffee?

757
00:41:24,977 --> 00:41:27,713
I'm good, I'm good, but thanks.

758
00:41:27,746 --> 00:41:28,881
- Something happen?
- No, can you just leave me

759
00:41:28,914 --> 00:41:30,316
the fuck alone?

760
00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:32,184
Please?

761
00:41:32,218 --> 00:41:34,320
Thanks.

762
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:44,296
All right, so me and Gil
are gonna head into town,

763
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,165
see how bad the path is.

764
00:41:46,198 --> 00:41:47,233
Babe, you want to call
the cops?

765
00:41:47,266 --> 00:41:49,135
Sure thing, babe.

766
00:42:21,867 --> 00:42:23,102
- Dude.
- Mm.

767
00:42:23,135 --> 00:42:25,104
Will you put the papers away?

768
00:42:25,137 --> 00:42:26,205
No.

769
00:42:26,238 --> 00:42:28,941
Scheduled to stand in
on surgery when I get back.

770
00:42:28,974 --> 00:42:29,808
I'm supposed to hold a heart.

771
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:31,911
Like an actual human heart
this time.

772
00:42:31,944 --> 00:42:34,013
- I got to be prepared.
- Okay.

773
00:42:34,046 --> 00:42:35,114
All right.

774
00:42:35,147 --> 00:42:36,382
It's your vacation to ruin.

775
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:39,351
This isn't much
of a vacation for me.

776
00:42:39,385 --> 00:42:40,719
I hate bugs and trees.

777
00:42:40,753 --> 00:42:41,754
Don't you live in Washington?

778
00:42:41,787 --> 00:42:42,421
Like, aren't there bugs
and trees?

779
00:42:42,454 --> 00:42:45,424
Seattle, city of Washington.

780
00:42:45,457 --> 00:42:47,459
There's no bugs,
just buildings and rain.

781
00:42:47,493 --> 00:42:48,561
Okay.

782
00:42:48,594 --> 00:42:51,463
So then why would you come
to a cabin in the woods

783
00:42:51,497 --> 00:42:53,232
where there are nothing
but bugs and trees

784
00:42:53,265 --> 00:42:54,500
as far as the eye can see?

785
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:56,468
- For Logan.
- What?

786
00:42:59,471 --> 00:43:01,473
I never should have
just left her, man.

787
00:43:01,507 --> 00:43:04,810
Wait, wait, hold on,
so this means you...

788
00:43:04,843 --> 00:43:06,779
I want her to come back
to Seattle with me.

789
00:43:08,847 --> 00:43:10,449
You think she would?

790
00:43:10,482 --> 00:43:12,051
I'll convince her,
I always do.

791
00:43:12,084 --> 00:43:13,786
Jesus Christ, dude.

792
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,389
Oh, shit.

793
00:43:20,793 --> 00:43:23,495
Hey.

794
00:43:23,529 --> 00:43:26,298
Yeah, no, I'm good.

795
00:43:26,332 --> 00:43:30,769
Last night was just scary.

796
00:43:32,171 --> 00:43:35,341
Yeah, I just...

797
00:43:35,374 --> 00:43:37,276
I just want to be home
with you.

798
00:43:40,846 --> 00:43:42,481
Jesus.

799
00:43:42,514 --> 00:43:44,183
Is everything okay?

800
00:43:44,216 --> 00:43:47,519
Yeah, it's just work stuff.

801
00:43:47,553 --> 00:43:49,054
Oh.

802
00:43:49,088 --> 00:43:53,459
Do they want a live band
or a DJ?

803
00:43:53,492 --> 00:43:56,262
Hey, are you okay?
Do you need to vent?

804
00:43:56,295 --> 00:43:59,098
No and no,

805
00:43:59,131 --> 00:44:03,235
but I know you won't stop
until I do, so...

806
00:44:04,503 --> 00:44:07,239
It's very true.

807
00:44:07,273 --> 00:44:10,409
How's the baby-making going?

808
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:13,846
Oh, not... we're not...

809
00:44:13,879 --> 00:44:16,315
Not here.

810
00:44:16,348 --> 00:44:18,183
The walls are really thin

811
00:44:18,217 --> 00:44:20,986
and everything is
made of wood, so...

812
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,821
- Right.
- Yeah, you are,

813
00:44:22,855 --> 00:44:25,824
but don't be embarrassed.

814
00:44:25,858 --> 00:44:27,359
You and James are at this point
in your life

815
00:44:27,393 --> 00:44:29,862
and, honestly, if it's going
to make you super happy,

816
00:44:29,895 --> 00:44:32,298
- then why not?
- Yeah, I know!

817
00:44:32,331 --> 00:44:34,066
I know, and I know
that this is what you do

818
00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:35,968
at this point.

819
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:39,271
- And I am happy.
- Are you?

820
00:44:45,511 --> 00:44:47,246
Oh, shit.

821
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,282
Fuck.

822
00:44:50,316 --> 00:44:54,186
We're not even on
a main road yet.

823
00:44:55,254 --> 00:44:56,088
Hey, can you pop the trunk?

824
00:44:56,121 --> 00:44:57,956
I'm gonna see
if you have a spare.

825
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,491
James?

826
00:44:59,525 --> 00:45:01,126
What are you doing?

827
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,127
I'm calling Rowan.

828
00:45:02,161 --> 00:45:03,595
No, don't do that.

829
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,464
- Why?
- Because...

830
00:45:05,497 --> 00:45:06,365
We have to tell the police.

831
00:45:06,398 --> 00:45:08,434
No, what if it's them,
one of them?

832
00:45:08,467 --> 00:45:10,135
This would just make it worse.

833
00:45:10,169 --> 00:45:12,338
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

834
00:45:12,371 --> 00:45:14,106
- Gil!
- Logan was right.

835
00:45:14,139 --> 00:45:15,040
She's always right.

836
00:45:15,074 --> 00:45:16,041
I need you to calm down.

837
00:45:16,075 --> 00:45:17,609
You're acting ridiculous,
gimme the phone.

838
00:45:17,644 --> 00:45:19,511
Dude, something weird
is going on.

839
00:45:19,545 --> 00:45:20,479
I thought she was overreacting,

840
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:22,081
but look at the evidence.

841
00:45:22,114 --> 00:45:24,283
The storm, the weird messages,
the fucking invitations,

842
00:45:24,316 --> 00:45:26,452
- and now a flat tire?
- So what?

843
00:45:26,485 --> 00:45:28,020
So what? What?

844
00:45:28,053 --> 00:45:29,121
What do you mean "so what"?

845
00:45:29,154 --> 00:45:31,023
I just don't see how
any of this is connected.

846
00:45:31,056 --> 00:45:33,158
Dude, give me my phone.

847
00:45:34,626 --> 00:45:36,562
Was it all part of
the perfect plan?

848
00:45:36,595 --> 00:45:37,664
Plan? What plan, Gil?

849
00:45:37,697 --> 00:45:39,264
Your plan, your fucking plan.

850
00:45:39,298 --> 00:45:40,966
Don't fucking touch me.

851
00:45:40,999 --> 00:45:43,369
You never told Rowan
about Andy.

852
00:45:43,402 --> 00:45:44,203
What did you just say?

853
00:45:44,236 --> 00:45:45,638
When you fucked Andy
freshman year.

854
00:45:45,672 --> 00:45:46,538
Before I even met Rowan?

855
00:45:46,572 --> 00:45:47,606
How many times?

856
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,441
What does this even matter?

857
00:45:49,475 --> 00:45:51,110
Is she in on this?

858
00:45:51,143 --> 00:45:52,478
Are you guys trying
to get revenge on Andy

859
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,380
and all of us are collateral?

860
00:45:54,413 --> 00:45:56,382
- Is that what this is?
- You think my secrets

861
00:45:56,415 --> 00:45:57,549
are the biggest ones here?

862
00:45:57,583 --> 00:45:59,051
- Yeah, okay.
- Oh my God,

863
00:45:59,084 --> 00:46:00,386
I'm not proud
for leaving Logan.

864
00:46:00,419 --> 00:46:01,587
That was never a secret.

865
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,021
Everyone knows that.

866
00:46:03,055 --> 00:46:05,057
Does Logan know why
Roger is the way he is?

867
00:46:07,259 --> 00:46:08,227
I don't know what
you're talking about.

868
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,396
Oh, you don't? Freshman year.

869
00:46:10,429 --> 00:46:11,664
You said you didn't
even like Logan.

870
00:46:11,698 --> 00:46:13,399
You said she was too shy,
too like-minded,

871
00:46:13,432 --> 00:46:14,500
too opinionated.

872
00:46:14,533 --> 00:46:16,402
And, then, I remember you
telling our pledge class

873
00:46:16,435 --> 00:46:18,170
how on your first date
you shoved your dick

874
00:46:18,203 --> 00:46:20,105
in her mouth just to get her
to "stop talking."

875
00:46:20,139 --> 00:46:20,906
I was an idiot.

876
00:46:20,939 --> 00:46:21,974
I said stupid shit
all the time.

877
00:46:22,007 --> 00:46:23,275
Then we met Roger.

878
00:46:23,308 --> 00:46:25,577
She really
and I mean really liked him.

879
00:46:25,611 --> 00:46:28,514
And he liked her, there was
like an instant spark.

880
00:46:28,547 --> 00:46:30,115
Then our first week of finals,

881
00:46:30,149 --> 00:46:31,483
Roger was really stressed
and you bought him

882
00:46:31,517 --> 00:46:33,952
some Adderall, was it,
to help him focus?

883
00:46:33,986 --> 00:46:35,722
Yeah. Kids do it all the time.

884
00:46:35,755 --> 00:46:38,223
Mm-hmm, but then you bought him
a second, third,

885
00:46:38,257 --> 00:46:39,558
fourth, and fifth batch, right?

886
00:46:39,591 --> 00:46:42,461
And then Adderall became Xanax,
and Xanax became oxy,

887
00:46:42,494 --> 00:46:43,962
and oxy became
a little bit of coke,

888
00:46:43,996 --> 00:46:45,097
and then you almost killed him
with fentanyl...

889
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:47,132
- All right, stop!
- ...'cause you didn't even care!

890
00:46:47,166 --> 00:46:48,267
You didn't care
about his addiction

891
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:53,305
or how much he would cry
every time the drugs got worse,

892
00:46:53,338 --> 00:46:54,973
because the worse they got,

893
00:46:55,007 --> 00:46:59,478
the easier it was for you
to ruin their lives.

894
00:46:59,511 --> 00:47:01,980
Do you think he knows
that you filled him

895
00:47:02,014 --> 00:47:05,150
with all those drugs
because she would've picked him?

896
00:47:05,184 --> 00:47:07,519
Because Gil Grady doesn't lose.

897
00:47:07,553 --> 00:47:08,755
Hmm?

898
00:47:08,788 --> 00:47:11,023
Should we tell him?

899
00:47:11,056 --> 00:47:12,491
You better watch
your fucking mouth.

900
00:47:12,524 --> 00:47:14,193
I said don't fucking touch me.

901
00:47:35,414 --> 00:47:38,584
What about your wedding night?

902
00:47:38,617 --> 00:47:41,587
When you told Andy
it wasn't too late?

903
00:47:43,055 --> 00:47:46,158
That you two could still
run away together?

904
00:47:46,191 --> 00:47:48,661
And then you fucked her
one last time.

905
00:47:48,695 --> 00:47:51,096
Maybe we should tell
your wife about that.

906
00:47:59,672 --> 00:48:01,039
Stop, stop, stop!

907
00:48:01,073 --> 00:48:02,809
Oh, fuck!

908
00:48:02,842 --> 00:48:04,443
Oh, no...

909
00:48:06,578 --> 00:48:09,481
What the hell is wrong with you?

910
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,685
My God, I need this hand.

911
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:14,253
What the fuck!

912
00:49:03,636 --> 00:49:05,203
Anyone wanna go skinny dipping?

913
00:49:05,237 --> 00:49:08,106
- No.
- Not really.

914
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:10,242
All right.

915
00:49:10,275 --> 00:49:11,644
How about a game?

916
00:49:11,678 --> 00:49:13,245
We're already drinking,

917
00:49:13,278 --> 00:49:15,314
so, king's cup?

918
00:49:15,347 --> 00:49:16,315
Truth or dare?

919
00:49:16,348 --> 00:49:17,583
No one's in the mood, Andy.

920
00:49:18,851 --> 00:49:20,485
Well, fuck this tension.

921
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:22,421
Seriously, I'm sick of it.

922
00:49:22,454 --> 00:49:25,190
I get it, we're stuck here.

923
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:32,899
Rowan,

924
00:49:32,932 --> 00:49:33,866
truth or dare?

925
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,802
Andy, come on.

926
00:49:35,835 --> 00:49:37,603
No, James, you come on.

927
00:49:37,637 --> 00:49:39,471
This sadness is gonna kill me

928
00:49:39,504 --> 00:49:41,540
before whoever sent
the letter does.

929
00:49:41,573 --> 00:49:43,442
I forgot about the letters.

930
00:49:44,644 --> 00:49:45,577
How?

931
00:49:49,849 --> 00:49:51,450
Rowan,

932
00:49:51,483 --> 00:49:52,785
truth or dare?

933
00:49:54,954 --> 00:49:56,689
Truth.

934
00:49:56,723 --> 00:49:58,758
Excellent.

935
00:50:01,226 --> 00:50:03,528
If not James,
who would it be?

936
00:50:06,933 --> 00:50:08,400
Uh...

937
00:50:08,433 --> 00:50:11,169
I guess I'd have to say

938
00:50:11,203 --> 00:50:12,537
Gil.

939
00:50:12,571 --> 00:50:16,375
And he wouldn't want
a real doctor.

940
00:50:16,408 --> 00:50:19,746
Wow, uh, don't remember
specifying that they had to be

941
00:50:19,779 --> 00:50:22,347
in our inner circle of friends,
but kudos.

942
00:50:22,381 --> 00:50:25,384
Stop! Come on!

943
00:50:25,417 --> 00:50:26,618
I'm joking.

944
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:31,758
There's no man I would rather
start a family with.

945
00:50:35,494 --> 00:50:37,229
Okay.

946
00:50:39,866 --> 00:50:41,668
Zach,

947
00:50:41,701 --> 00:50:43,201
truth or dare?

948
00:50:44,536 --> 00:50:46,673
Uh, truth.

949
00:50:46,706 --> 00:50:50,943
What is your biggest,
deepest, darkest secret?

950
00:50:50,977 --> 00:50:52,477
Rowan, I don't think
that's very nice.

951
00:50:52,511 --> 00:50:53,680
What?

952
00:50:53,713 --> 00:50:56,649
Secrets... secrets
are no fun, right?

953
00:50:56,683 --> 00:50:58,651
Do you really think
that's the smartest idea?

954
00:50:58,685 --> 00:51:01,386
Whoever wrote that
likes to play games.

955
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:02,587
So do I.

956
00:51:04,757 --> 00:51:06,358
Zach?

957
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,896
- Um...
- I can answer it for you.

958
00:51:09,929 --> 00:51:12,230
If you know it,
then it's not a secret, dumbass.

959
00:51:12,264 --> 00:51:13,432
Don't call her that.

960
00:51:13,465 --> 00:51:14,634
Go ahead, Zach, tell her.

961
00:51:16,368 --> 00:51:17,469
Tell her.

962
00:51:17,502 --> 00:51:19,604
I'm in therapy.

963
00:51:20,807 --> 00:51:23,275
Um, when I lost my job

964
00:51:23,308 --> 00:51:25,712
and Zoe left me,
I was in a really dark place,

965
00:51:25,745 --> 00:51:28,848
so I now go to therapy
twice a week,

966
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:31,884
and I have medication
which I refuse to take

967
00:51:31,918 --> 00:51:35,287
because I wanna maintain
some level of normalcy

968
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,490
which, as you all know,
is pretty hard for me.

969
00:51:38,523 --> 00:51:40,559
Um, and because
I don't take them,

970
00:51:40,592 --> 00:51:44,496
I now get horrific nightmares
which Roger can attest to,

971
00:51:44,529 --> 00:51:47,867
and... I think I'm hitting
all the notes here.

972
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,902
Did I miss anything, Rowan?

973
00:51:49,936 --> 00:51:51,503
I was just trying
to have some fun.

974
00:51:51,536 --> 00:51:53,505
I think I was, too,
but if that's not

975
00:51:53,538 --> 00:51:55,507
your definition of fun,
what is?

976
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,777
Um... Roger,

977
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:00,512
truth or dare?

978
00:52:00,545 --> 00:52:01,814
- Dare.
- Terrific.

979
00:52:01,848 --> 00:52:05,752
How about I dare you
to kiss someone right now?

980
00:52:05,785 --> 00:52:07,252
Make it count.

981
00:52:27,339 --> 00:52:28,908
- Thanks, little buddy.
- No problem.

982
00:52:34,046 --> 00:52:35,547
Your turn to pick somebody.

983
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,784
I don't think anyone
wants to play.

984
00:52:37,817 --> 00:52:39,384
No, keep going.

985
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:40,820
I'm having so much fun.

986
00:52:40,853 --> 00:52:43,522
Okay! Andy, truth or dare?

987
00:52:47,827 --> 00:52:49,427
Dare.

988
00:52:50,797 --> 00:52:55,034
I dare you to...

989
00:52:55,067 --> 00:52:56,601
shut up for the rest
of the night.

990
00:52:58,370 --> 00:52:59,604
Well, that's impossible

991
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:00,873
'cause I have to nominate
the next...

992
00:53:00,907 --> 00:53:02,407
No, no, no, see,
Zach can be your voice.

993
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,844
He barely talks,
and you talk so much...

994
00:53:04,877 --> 00:53:06,012
Logan, truth or dare?

995
00:53:08,948 --> 00:53:11,751
- Truth.
- Hmm.

996
00:53:11,784 --> 00:53:14,921
Who is your very best friend
in the whole wide world?

997
00:53:14,954 --> 00:53:16,488
And you can't say Zach Davis.

998
00:53:19,058 --> 00:53:20,927
Okay, so, if I can't pick you...

999
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,095
- Right.
- Then I guess I'd have to pick

1000
00:53:23,129 --> 00:53:24,462
Andy.

1001
00:53:24,496 --> 00:53:25,463
What?

1002
00:53:26,732 --> 00:53:27,733
What?

1003
00:53:27,767 --> 00:53:28,768
No, it's just weird.

1004
00:53:28,801 --> 00:53:29,902
I didn't expect that.

1005
00:53:29,936 --> 00:53:31,804
It's just a game, Rowan.

1006
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:34,841
Careful,
your jealousy is showing.

1007
00:53:34,874 --> 00:53:37,442
I would never be jealous of you.

1008
00:53:37,475 --> 00:53:40,378
You've been not so subtle
about it all weekend.

1009
00:53:40,412 --> 00:53:41,848
What's there to be jealous of?

1010
00:53:41,881 --> 00:53:43,883
I have a career, a husband.
What do you have?

1011
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:45,617
All right, stop.

1012
00:53:47,153 --> 00:53:48,821
Gil,

1013
00:53:48,855 --> 00:53:50,089
truth or date?

1014
00:53:50,122 --> 00:53:51,924
Truth.

1015
00:53:51,958 --> 00:53:55,560
How did you really break
your hand?

1016
00:53:57,529 --> 00:53:59,131
- I fell.
- You're lying.

1017
00:53:59,165 --> 00:54:00,666
Stop, stop doing that.

1018
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,101
- Doing what?
- Interrogating me.

1019
00:54:02,134 --> 00:54:04,436
- I'm fucking sick of it.
- Maybe he did it on purpose.

1020
00:54:04,469 --> 00:54:06,939
- Excuse me?
- I just think it's kinda funny

1021
00:54:06,973 --> 00:54:09,909
how you and James
are the only two people

1022
00:54:09,942 --> 00:54:11,443
who say we can't leave.

1023
00:54:11,476 --> 00:54:12,712
You think I did all this?

1024
00:54:12,745 --> 00:54:13,980
I do, yeah!

1025
00:54:15,014 --> 00:54:17,116
- Really?
- Yes.

1026
00:54:19,051 --> 00:54:21,654
Well, you're right, it was me.

1027
00:54:21,687 --> 00:54:22,955
I planned all of it.

1028
00:54:22,989 --> 00:54:25,124
The letters,
the bloody messages in the barn.

1029
00:54:25,157 --> 00:54:27,492
I even broke my hand to make it
more of a fucking challenge.

1030
00:54:27,525 --> 00:54:29,662
- I bet you did!
- Boys, enough.

1031
00:54:31,596 --> 00:54:33,032
You know, isn't it strange

1032
00:54:33,065 --> 00:54:34,934
that you and your wife
are the only ones

1033
00:54:34,967 --> 00:54:36,002
who didn't send anyone letters?

1034
00:54:36,035 --> 00:54:37,469
What you trying to say?

1035
00:54:37,502 --> 00:54:39,005
You know exactly
what I'm trying to say.

1036
00:54:39,038 --> 00:54:41,573
And Logan's the only person here
to have invited two people.

1037
00:54:41,606 --> 00:54:43,042
Is she in conspiracy
with my wife and I?

1038
00:54:43,075 --> 00:54:45,044
- Leave Logan out of this.
- Yeah, 'cause it could never be

1039
00:54:45,077 --> 00:54:47,780
either one of your faults
'cause you're just so perfect.

1040
00:54:47,813 --> 00:54:49,682
- I'm gonna tell her.
- Tell her.

1041
00:54:49,715 --> 00:54:50,850
Tell everyone.
Tell Roger.

1042
00:54:50,883 --> 00:54:52,084
- What?
- Guys, knock it off.

1043
00:54:52,118 --> 00:54:53,753
Aw, is Zachie sad?

1044
00:54:53,786 --> 00:54:55,487
- Is Zachie upset...
- Gil, stop!

1045
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,123
- Oh, shut up, slut.
- Fuck you!

1046
00:54:57,156 --> 00:54:59,091
- Whoa!
- What's wrong, Zachie?

1047
00:54:59,125 --> 00:55:00,960
Are you gonna cry?

1048
00:55:02,962 --> 00:55:04,797
I just don't think
that we should be turning

1049
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:05,932
on each other, Gil.

1050
00:55:05,965 --> 00:55:07,599
Yeah, well,

1051
00:55:07,633 --> 00:55:10,670
it's a little too late
for that now, isn't it?

1052
00:55:17,944 --> 00:55:21,647
Tomorrow when they clear
the roads, we get outta here.

1053
00:55:42,068 --> 00:55:43,568
Fuck.

1054
00:55:49,008 --> 00:55:50,876
Fuck!

1055
00:56:44,964 --> 00:56:46,098
Zach?

1056
00:56:48,768 --> 00:56:50,669
- Oh.
- Sorry.

1057
00:56:50,703 --> 00:56:52,071
No reception in the basement?

1058
00:56:52,104 --> 00:56:55,074
- Uh, no, just music.
- Oh.

1059
00:56:55,107 --> 00:56:58,711
Um, can I sleep in here tonight?

1060
00:56:59,345 --> 00:57:01,579
Uh... sure.

1061
00:57:01,613 --> 00:57:03,015
Uh, are you okay?

1062
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:06,252
No.

1063
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,088
Hop in.

1064
00:57:27,873 --> 00:57:29,075
Ready to lose?

1065
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,813
Just like college.

1066
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:46,092
Hey.

1067
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:50,663
Did your first option
turn you down?

1068
00:57:52,031 --> 00:57:54,967
You're mad then, I'm guessing?

1069
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,335
Why would you ask that?

1070
00:57:56,368 --> 00:57:59,905
For... me kissing Andy
at the fire.

1071
00:57:59,939 --> 00:58:02,174
No, you and Andy
were always a thing.

1072
00:58:02,208 --> 00:58:03,409
No...

1073
00:58:03,442 --> 00:58:06,412
we were not always a thing.

1074
00:58:06,445 --> 00:58:08,214
Moved out 'cause, I don't know,

1075
00:58:08,247 --> 00:58:10,983
there's no one else
to go home to, I guess.

1076
00:58:11,016 --> 00:58:13,719
It's not a thing,
it's... it's sad.

1077
00:58:13,752 --> 00:58:16,789
Roger, you don't have to explain
yourself, it was just a game.

1078
00:58:16,822 --> 00:58:19,925
Were you expecting me
to kiss you during this game?

1079
00:58:22,128 --> 00:58:23,963
I'm kidding.

1080
00:58:25,097 --> 00:58:26,165
Okay.

1081
00:58:28,801 --> 00:58:30,436
Do you wanna smoke a little bit?

1082
00:58:30,469 --> 00:58:31,737
I wish we could.

1083
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:33,038
All my drugs keep disappearing,

1084
00:58:33,072 --> 00:58:35,407
so I have nothing to offer.

1085
00:58:35,441 --> 00:58:37,877
Drugs as in... plural.

1086
00:58:38,911 --> 00:58:40,379
You know what I mean, like...

1087
00:58:40,412 --> 00:58:41,914
I'm... I'm fine.

1088
00:58:41,947 --> 00:58:43,849
I thought you got better, Roger.

1089
00:58:43,883 --> 00:58:47,753
I'm... I'm better from what
I used to be, for sure.

1090
00:58:47,786 --> 00:58:49,054
Really?

1091
00:58:50,856 --> 00:58:52,758
Um...

1092
00:58:52,791 --> 00:58:55,027
I've been like that all day.

1093
00:58:56,328 --> 00:58:58,030
All right, come on,
smoke with me.

1094
00:58:58,063 --> 00:59:00,132
- It'll get rid of the shaking.
- I don't have anything.

1095
00:59:00,166 --> 00:59:01,167
I told you that.

1096
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,402
Oh, I know, I know.

1097
00:59:03,435 --> 00:59:05,237
- Logan...
- But what if I do?

1098
00:59:05,271 --> 00:59:06,372
You don't. That's...

1099
00:59:07,439 --> 00:59:09,041
She tiny but she mighty.

1100
00:59:09,074 --> 00:59:10,776
Wow, wow, nice.

1101
00:59:10,809 --> 00:59:12,278
Okay, great.

1102
00:59:12,311 --> 00:59:13,913
You know this is illegal?

1103
00:59:13,946 --> 00:59:14,947
- Is it?
- Yeah.

1104
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:17,149
I'm 127 percent sure

1105
00:59:17,183 --> 00:59:18,284
this is illegal.

1106
00:59:18,317 --> 00:59:19,952
Oh my God, then it's so good

1107
00:59:19,985 --> 00:59:21,220
that I know a great lawyer.

1108
00:59:21,253 --> 00:59:23,122
- Where... of course you do.
- It's me.

1109
00:59:23,155 --> 00:59:25,024
Where has this been
the whole time?

1110
00:59:25,057 --> 00:59:28,827
- Holding out on me.
- I am, 'cause you upset me.

1111
00:59:28,861 --> 00:59:31,096
- You're welcome.
- Thanks.

1112
00:59:33,232 --> 00:59:34,900
Do you remember that night

1113
00:59:34,934 --> 00:59:37,937
freshman year when I ate
really bad sushi

1114
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:40,472
and I was throwing up all night?

1115
00:59:40,506 --> 00:59:43,842
But you laid in bed with me
for like five hours

1116
00:59:43,876 --> 00:59:46,378
just running your hands
through my hair

1117
00:59:46,412 --> 00:59:49,949
and singing really badly
to make me feel better.

1118
00:59:49,982 --> 00:59:52,885
- It wasn't that bad.
- It was pretty bad.

1119
00:59:52,918 --> 00:59:56,755
Thoughtful and tone-deaf
does sound like me.

1120
00:59:56,789 --> 00:59:59,892
I think about that night a lot.

1121
01:00:02,361 --> 01:00:05,197
I think about you all the time.

1122
01:00:11,337 --> 01:00:13,272
- Ow.
- What... what happened?

1123
01:00:13,305 --> 01:00:15,140
- Nothing.
- You winced. What's wrong?

1124
01:00:15,174 --> 01:00:17,076
No, I'm fine,
don't worry about it.

1125
01:00:17,109 --> 01:00:19,445
Andy, Andy, stop, stop.

1126
01:00:19,478 --> 01:00:21,313
- What did you do?
- I'm fine.

1127
01:00:21,347 --> 01:00:23,082
- When did you do that?
- I'm fine!

1128
01:00:23,115 --> 01:00:26,485
- Is that why you're in therapy?
- Andy, no, I'm fine.

1129
01:00:26,518 --> 01:00:28,787
- Then show me.
- What?

1130
01:00:28,821 --> 01:00:31,257
I want to see how fine you are.

1131
01:00:40,432 --> 01:00:43,902
Is the other one like that?

1132
01:00:43,936 --> 01:00:45,537
Yeah.

1133
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:50,576
But why didn't you call me?

1134
01:00:50,609 --> 01:00:52,278
Any of us.

1135
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:57,049
I didn't think anyone
would care.

1136
01:00:57,082 --> 01:00:58,784
Oh my God.

1137
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:01,920
Is this your secret?

1138
01:01:01,954 --> 01:01:03,055
My secret?

1139
01:01:03,088 --> 01:01:04,857
That message...

1140
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:07,393
Stupid message.

1141
01:01:07,426 --> 01:01:09,161
Oh.

1142
01:01:09,194 --> 01:01:10,429
Um...

1143
01:01:11,497 --> 01:01:14,933
No, I don't think
this would be mine, Andy.

1144
01:01:14,967 --> 01:01:16,535
How?

1145
01:01:16,568 --> 01:01:20,039
I have older secrets.

1146
01:01:20,072 --> 01:01:22,374
Zach, you're...
you're starting to scare me.

1147
01:01:24,009 --> 01:01:25,210
What's going on?

1148
01:01:27,513 --> 01:01:30,382
Um...

1149
01:01:30,416 --> 01:01:32,217
Andy, uh...

1150
01:01:35,921 --> 01:01:37,556
Wait. What... what are you doing?

1151
01:01:37,589 --> 01:01:39,358
Andy, I'm so in love
with you, okay?

1152
01:01:39,391 --> 01:01:41,160
I have been in love with you
since the first moment

1153
01:01:41,193 --> 01:01:42,628
I ever saw you,
that night that you came

1154
01:01:42,662 --> 01:01:44,363
into my and Roger's room
freshman year

1155
01:01:44,396 --> 01:01:46,265
in your underwear, drunk,
looking for Logan.

1156
01:01:46,298 --> 01:01:48,367
I remember thinking
you are the most beautiful girl

1157
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,369
that I have ever seen, and I
never stopped thinking that.

1158
01:01:50,402 --> 01:01:52,604
I've thought that every single
second for the last eight years

1159
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:56,208
and I've just been too much
of a... pussy to tell you

1160
01:01:56,241 --> 01:01:58,944
because every day I wonder
what would've happened

1161
01:01:58,977 --> 01:02:01,413
if I'd told you sooner
because it's always been me.

1162
01:02:01,447 --> 01:02:02,649
It's not Roger, it's me.

1163
01:02:02,682 --> 01:02:05,217
And I think that
if I had told you sooner,

1164
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:09,154
I wouldn't have ever done
any of this.

1165
01:02:09,188 --> 01:02:10,923
Zach...

1166
01:02:10,956 --> 01:02:14,426
do you really think
I'm that stupid?

1167
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:16,495
- What?
- Last night, I...

1168
01:02:16,528 --> 01:02:18,063
You rejected me.

1169
01:02:18,097 --> 01:02:19,666
- No, I wanted to come.
- And now that I know,

1170
01:02:19,699 --> 01:02:21,400
all of a sudden
you're in love with me?

1171
01:02:21,433 --> 01:02:24,136
Yeah... no,
I didn't have sex with you

1172
01:02:24,169 --> 01:02:25,638
because I'm in love with you,
that's my point.

1173
01:02:25,672 --> 01:02:27,172
You think because I'm me,
you can make up

1174
01:02:27,206 --> 01:02:28,440
this bullshit love confession

1175
01:02:28,474 --> 01:02:31,243
to deflect from the fact that
you're trying to kill yourself?

1176
01:02:31,276 --> 01:02:33,078
- That is not what I'm doing!
- "Oh, Andy's easy.

1177
01:02:33,112 --> 01:02:34,613
I'll just fuck her
until she shuts up.

1178
01:02:34,647 --> 01:02:35,581
She'll totally forget..."

1179
01:02:35,614 --> 01:02:38,350
I wasn't even gonna tell you
about it!

1180
01:02:41,487 --> 01:02:46,191
You were in love with me
when you were engaged?

1181
01:02:46,225 --> 01:02:48,026
I tried not to be.

1182
01:02:53,165 --> 01:02:55,234
Okay, well, then,
what was this, Andy?

1183
01:02:55,267 --> 01:02:56,969
You came in,
you're talking about that night,

1184
01:02:57,002 --> 01:02:58,570
you were cuddling me,
you tried to kiss me.

1185
01:02:58,604 --> 01:03:00,239
You're gonna say
that you never had

1186
01:03:00,272 --> 01:03:03,175
any kind of feelings
for me whatsoever?

1187
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:05,577
- I'm not in love with you, Zach.
- Andy, come on.

1188
01:03:05,611 --> 01:03:06,612
I'm sorry, Andy.

1189
01:03:06,646 --> 01:03:09,448
- I can't be near you right now.
- Please don't.

1190
01:03:27,767 --> 01:03:30,602
- I don't remember that.
- You totally should!

1191
01:03:33,105 --> 01:03:34,406
Oh, man.

1192
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,709
I had to sit
on your tiny twin bed,

1193
01:03:36,743 --> 01:03:38,477
which is the smallest thing
in the world

1194
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:40,680
with all the pillows
and stuffed animals and shit.

1195
01:03:40,713 --> 01:03:42,481
I know, I was there.

1196
01:03:42,514 --> 01:03:45,317
I listened to you cry
about how he never...

1197
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:49,321
called or texted
after you lost it to him.

1198
01:03:49,354 --> 01:03:52,324
- Do you have a point?
- Yeah, I...

1199
01:03:54,359 --> 01:03:57,196
I kissed you, and then...

1200
01:04:00,432 --> 01:04:02,301
And like, the next day,

1201
01:04:02,334 --> 01:04:03,670
you guys were together.

1202
01:04:03,703 --> 01:04:06,038
Yeah, but I slept with you
like a year later.

1203
01:04:06,071 --> 01:04:09,208
Just to get back at Gil, like,
it wasn't anything serious.

1204
01:04:09,241 --> 01:04:12,277
- No!
- It's exactly what happened,

1205
01:04:12,311 --> 01:04:14,313
'cause that night,
he went to his frat party

1206
01:04:14,346 --> 01:04:18,383
instead of your soccer game,
and you came back to my room

1207
01:04:18,417 --> 01:04:21,053
crying, and we...

1208
01:04:21,086 --> 01:04:23,088
and, uh...

1209
01:04:25,457 --> 01:04:29,595
We never talked about it
after that ever again.

1210
01:04:29,628 --> 01:04:32,632
How do you remember
all of that?

1211
01:04:32,665 --> 01:04:35,167
It's just stupid, I...

1212
01:04:36,468 --> 01:04:38,638
I remember everything about you.

1213
01:04:38,671 --> 01:04:40,539
It's dumb, I know, it's stupid.

1214
01:04:40,572 --> 01:04:42,441
No, it's not.

1215
01:04:42,474 --> 01:04:46,545
Yeah, it is, but it's true, so.

1216
01:04:46,578 --> 01:04:48,681
Okay, I have to tell you
something.

1217
01:04:48,715 --> 01:04:51,483
- What?
- I had the biggest crush on you.

1218
01:04:51,517 --> 01:04:54,386
- Yeah, okay.
- I did, after that night!

1219
01:04:54,419 --> 01:04:56,121
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

1220
01:04:57,523 --> 01:04:59,759
Why didn't you tell me?

1221
01:05:02,094 --> 01:05:04,329
I don't know.

1222
01:05:04,363 --> 01:05:06,265
- I was scared, I think.
- Of what?

1223
01:05:06,298 --> 01:05:10,068
- 'Cause I wasn't him?
- No, that's not...

1224
01:05:11,671 --> 01:05:16,308
No matter how many times
he hurt you and...

1225
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:20,579
...how many times you said
he made you feel like

1226
01:05:20,612 --> 01:05:25,183
just completely worthless,
like shit,

1227
01:05:25,217 --> 01:05:28,655
you always chose him, and...

1228
01:05:30,522 --> 01:05:32,357
I get it, I guess.

1229
01:05:32,391 --> 01:05:34,560
I wasn't cool.

1230
01:05:34,593 --> 01:05:39,565
I wasn't popular,
I wasn't strong, I couldn't...

1231
01:05:39,598 --> 01:05:42,501
I couldn't get us into parties,

1232
01:05:42,534 --> 01:05:44,503
couldn't protect you,
I just wasn't him.

1233
01:05:44,536 --> 01:05:47,840
- I never wanted you to be him.
- I tried, I always tried.

1234
01:05:47,874 --> 01:05:50,108
- I'm still trying.
- Roger, hey, stop!

1235
01:05:50,142 --> 01:05:53,846
I... I followed you around
like a puppy dog, you know.

1236
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,214
I slept with your best friend
hoping you'd notice me.

1237
01:05:56,248 --> 01:05:58,317
I was a... I was a drug addict.

1238
01:06:03,723 --> 01:06:06,558
I...

1239
01:06:06,592 --> 01:06:08,627
I am.

1240
01:06:09,729 --> 01:06:10,863
I know.

1241
01:06:12,865 --> 01:06:16,836
I wouldn't have chosen me
either, honestly.

1242
01:06:16,869 --> 01:06:19,471
- I wish I had chose you.
- No, you don't.

1243
01:06:19,504 --> 01:06:21,506
- I do, no, I suck.
- No, I suck!

1244
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:24,509
I should've told you how I felt.
I should've...

1245
01:06:24,543 --> 01:06:26,411
I should've kissed you
when I wanted to,

1246
01:06:26,445 --> 01:06:29,247
I should've said something
sooner,

1247
01:06:29,281 --> 01:06:31,550
spoke my mind, I don't know.

1248
01:06:31,583 --> 01:06:34,754
- I should've done a lot.
- When did you want to kiss me?

1249
01:06:37,356 --> 01:06:40,626
When I met you,

1250
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:42,260
at that party.

1251
01:06:44,664 --> 01:06:47,366
The first time
we went ice skating.

1252
01:06:49,368 --> 01:06:53,505
The football game you won with
like four pointless overtimes.

1253
01:06:59,712 --> 01:07:01,681
Now.

1254
01:07:01,714 --> 01:07:03,683
I want to kiss you now.

1255
01:07:13,458 --> 01:07:16,628
Sorry if that was... forward.

1256
01:07:16,663 --> 01:07:18,230
No, no, no.

1257
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:27,606
Do you want to talk about it?

1258
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,708
No.

1259
01:07:28,741 --> 01:07:30,575
Because you did do it.

1260
01:07:30,609 --> 01:07:31,476
Oh my God.

1261
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:34,346
- That is just great, James!
- I had to.

1262
01:07:34,379 --> 01:07:35,648
I don't even know
what that means.

1263
01:07:35,682 --> 01:07:36,883
He was talking like a lunatic!

1264
01:07:36,916 --> 01:07:38,417
He kept going on about the plan

1265
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:39,786
and saying that Logan
was always right,

1266
01:07:39,819 --> 01:07:41,453
whatever the fuck that means...
I had to!

1267
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:44,857
I'm not a monster.

1268
01:07:50,328 --> 01:07:54,566
Look, I believe you, okay?

1269
01:07:54,599 --> 01:07:57,937
I'm sorry.

1270
01:07:57,970 --> 01:07:59,471
I don't know if I trust them.

1271
01:07:59,504 --> 01:08:00,873
James, they're our best friends.

1272
01:08:00,907 --> 01:08:01,708
Are they?

1273
01:08:01,741 --> 01:08:04,609
When was the last time
we saw them?

1274
01:08:04,644 --> 01:08:06,578
- Our wedding.
- Two years ago.

1275
01:08:06,611 --> 01:08:07,680
Two fucking years ago.

1276
01:08:07,714 --> 01:08:11,718
Do we even know if
they're the same people anymore?

1277
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:17,222
You got me.

1278
01:08:19,391 --> 01:08:21,027
You can trust me.

1279
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:23,595
I know. I know.

1280
01:08:23,628 --> 01:08:25,732
You're my best friend for life.

1281
01:08:34,372 --> 01:08:36,676
What, what are you doing?

1282
01:08:36,709 --> 01:08:39,679
I'm distracting you.

1283
01:08:39,712 --> 01:08:41,446
Rowan, come on.

1284
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:43,683
Hey.

1285
01:08:43,716 --> 01:08:45,584
Please.

1286
01:08:47,754 --> 01:08:49,856
Wait.

1287
01:08:49,889 --> 01:08:51,958
Give me a minute.

1288
01:08:51,991 --> 01:08:53,592
Yeah.

1289
01:09:24,489 --> 01:09:25,490
Fuck.

1290
01:09:28,694 --> 01:09:29,896
Oh, shit.

1291
01:09:29,929 --> 01:09:31,097
Shit!

1292
01:10:18,211 --> 01:10:21,613
Multiple scenes like this are
playing out throughout the area.

1293
01:10:21,647 --> 01:10:23,515
Look, this tree has just smashed

1294
01:10:23,548 --> 01:10:25,918
not just through the roof but
through the side of the house,

1295
01:10:25,952 --> 01:10:26,886
through the windows.

1296
01:10:26,919 --> 01:10:29,454
A lot of the interior
of the house is exposed.

1297
01:10:29,487 --> 01:10:31,389
Trees have fallen
on power lines,

1298
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:32,992
on roadways,
blocking roadways,

1299
01:10:33,025 --> 01:10:36,428
and police are urging people
to stay off the roads

1300
01:10:36,461 --> 01:10:38,597
if at all possible,
just trying to convey

1301
01:10:38,631 --> 01:10:40,465
how dangerous it is out here.

1302
01:10:40,498 --> 01:10:42,702
Portions of the northeast
underwater

1303
01:10:42,735 --> 01:10:46,639
after severe storms
pounded the region.

1304
01:10:46,672 --> 01:10:49,008
Some streets look
more like waterways,

1305
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:52,845
water so high, roadblocks
floating down the streets...

1306
01:10:55,681 --> 01:10:57,582
Babe, what's going on?

1307
01:10:57,616 --> 01:10:59,517
What is this, James?

1308
01:10:59,551 --> 01:11:00,253
Where... where did...

1309
01:11:00,286 --> 01:11:02,154
- James!
- Where did you get that?

1310
01:11:02,188 --> 01:11:04,156
Answer the question now.

1311
01:11:05,725 --> 01:11:07,525
Babe, babe,
it was a long time ago.

1312
01:11:07,559 --> 01:11:08,627
And you never thought
to tell me?

1313
01:11:08,661 --> 01:11:10,863
Well, I didn't technically
know you when it...

1314
01:11:10,897 --> 01:11:12,632
when it happened.

1315
01:11:12,665 --> 01:11:14,432
How many times did "it" happen?

1316
01:11:14,466 --> 01:11:15,467
I don't know, I don't know.

1317
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:18,570
- How many times?
- I don't know, like three.

1318
01:11:18,603 --> 01:11:20,438
Three?

1319
01:11:20,472 --> 01:11:22,141
Oh my God.

1320
01:11:22,174 --> 01:11:23,142
- Three?
- Babe.

1321
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:25,845
- I hate you!
- Stop, stop!

1322
01:11:25,878 --> 01:11:28,114
I hate her!
You know that I hate her!

1323
01:11:28,147 --> 01:11:30,049
- That's why I couldn't tell you.
- I hate you!

1324
01:11:30,082 --> 01:11:31,449
Stop, stop!

1325
01:11:31,483 --> 01:11:32,617
Stop!

1326
01:11:36,188 --> 01:11:37,690
I'm having an affair.

1327
01:11:43,963 --> 01:11:46,498
What?

1328
01:11:46,531 --> 01:11:48,000
What are you... I don't...

1329
01:11:48,034 --> 01:11:49,869
I don't... with who?

1330
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:52,038
Riley.

1331
01:11:52,071 --> 01:11:55,007
Your... your female
yoga instructor Riley?

1332
01:11:55,041 --> 01:11:56,742
Yeah.

1333
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:01,080
For how long?

1334
01:12:02,014 --> 01:12:03,883
- It's not...
- I said...

1335
01:12:03,916 --> 01:12:06,618
for how fucking long?

1336
01:12:06,652 --> 01:12:08,154
Over a year.

1337
01:12:10,856 --> 01:12:11,991
A year?

1338
01:12:12,892 --> 01:12:14,760
- I do love you.
- Apparently not enough.

1339
01:12:14,794 --> 01:12:16,528
- No, I wanted to end it.
- I don't believe you.

1340
01:12:16,561 --> 01:12:18,130
I was, as soon
as we got back home.

1341
01:12:18,164 --> 01:12:21,200
Has she been to our house?
Has she slept in my bed?

1342
01:12:23,069 --> 01:12:24,270
Answer me.

1343
01:12:25,304 --> 01:12:26,138
I said answer me!

1344
01:12:26,172 --> 01:12:27,106
No, she's never been
to the house.

1345
01:12:27,139 --> 01:12:28,174
I swear to God, Rowan,
if you're lying.

1346
01:12:28,207 --> 01:12:31,210
I'm not lying.
She's never been to the house.

1347
01:12:31,243 --> 01:12:33,012
- I want a divorce.
- I think I'm pregnant.

1348
01:12:33,045 --> 01:12:34,246
You're not pregnant,
you're lying.

1349
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:35,147
- I'm not lying.
- You're not pregnant!

1350
01:12:35,181 --> 01:12:37,683
- You can't leave me!
- Stop talking!

1351
01:12:37,717 --> 01:12:38,918
Stop talking.

1352
01:12:41,821 --> 01:12:43,089
I can't believe this.

1353
01:12:43,122 --> 01:12:46,792
I can't believe you slept with
Andy and you didn't tell me.

1354
01:12:46,826 --> 01:12:48,593
You can't believe me?

1355
01:12:48,626 --> 01:12:50,262
You're gay,
and you can't believe me!

1356
01:12:50,296 --> 01:12:51,797
I am not gay!

1357
01:12:51,831 --> 01:12:53,165
You've been having an affair
for over a year.

1358
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:54,433
- You gotta sorta like it.
- I don't!

1359
01:12:54,467 --> 01:12:57,569
- Don't what? You don't what?
- Stop, stop yelling at me!

1360
01:12:57,602 --> 01:13:00,538
- Don't you fucking touch me!
- Don't you fucking touch me!

1361
01:13:13,753 --> 01:13:15,154
- Hey, are you...
- What the...

1362
01:13:15,187 --> 01:13:16,554
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1363
01:13:16,588 --> 01:13:18,190
Oh my God, get out,
Gil, get out!

1364
01:13:18,224 --> 01:13:20,126
Obviously I didn't respond
to your text fast enough.

1365
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:21,761
What are you talking about,
what text?

1366
01:13:21,794 --> 01:13:23,095
The text you just
fucking sent me.

1367
01:13:23,129 --> 01:13:26,265
- I don't even have my phone.
- What?

1368
01:13:26,298 --> 01:13:29,735
I haven't had my phone for
hours, I can't find it anywhere.

1369
01:13:29,769 --> 01:13:31,337
Why do you have the letters?

1370
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:33,339
I was looking for answers.

1371
01:13:33,372 --> 01:13:35,607
Yeah, and I just got mine.

1372
01:13:35,641 --> 01:13:39,345
Stop being so dramatic, dude,
just get outta here.

1373
01:13:39,378 --> 01:13:40,780
Logan.

1374
01:13:42,014 --> 01:13:43,015
No.

1375
01:13:44,917 --> 01:13:46,018
Bye-bye.

1376
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:48,988
He's such an idiot.

1377
01:13:49,021 --> 01:13:50,322
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

1378
01:13:59,331 --> 01:14:01,599
Oh my God, Gil, get off him!

1379
01:14:01,634 --> 01:14:02,835
Gil, stop!

1380
01:14:02,868 --> 01:14:04,036
Stop, you're gonna kill him!

1381
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:05,704
Oh my God!

1382
01:14:05,738 --> 01:14:06,972
Fucking psycho!

1383
01:14:10,643 --> 01:14:12,878
- Fuck!
- Oh my God.

1384
01:14:13,611 --> 01:14:14,947
Stop running like a little bitch

1385
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:16,182
so I can beat the shit
out of you.

1386
01:14:16,215 --> 01:14:17,716
With one hand?
Come on, let's go.

1387
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:19,185
Both of you, knock it off.

1388
01:14:19,218 --> 01:14:21,053
Tell her. Tell her,
the only reason you asked her

1389
01:14:21,087 --> 01:14:22,855
on a second date is because
I told you I liked her.

1390
01:14:22,888 --> 01:14:24,023
- That's not true.
- Yeah, bullshit.

1391
01:14:24,056 --> 01:14:26,058
Could somebody please come up
here and help me please!

1392
01:14:26,092 --> 01:14:27,093
You couldn't just let us
be happy?

1393
01:14:27,126 --> 01:14:28,861
You just had to get the girl
to prove a point?

1394
01:14:28,894 --> 01:14:30,329
All she ever was to you
was a fucking point!

1395
01:14:30,362 --> 01:14:32,264
- I loved her.
- You left her though

1396
01:14:32,298 --> 01:14:33,999
for a goddamn internship?

1397
01:14:34,033 --> 01:14:36,168
- Fuck you!
- Logan, what's going on?

1398
01:14:36,202 --> 01:14:38,871
Stop it, you both
are acting like children.

1399
01:14:38,904 --> 01:14:40,406
- You wanna see childish?
- No.

1400
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:42,074
You took my fucking pills?

1401
01:14:42,108 --> 01:14:43,776
Aw, does the junkie
need his fix?

1402
01:14:43,809 --> 01:14:45,778
- What is happening?
- Give them back to me!

1403
01:14:45,811 --> 01:14:47,079
So pathetic!

1404
01:14:47,113 --> 01:14:49,849
Look at you.
She'll never want you, get it?

1405
01:14:49,882 --> 01:14:51,884
So stop trying.

1406
01:14:51,917 --> 01:14:54,019
Never, never, huh?

1407
01:14:54,053 --> 01:14:55,821
Bloody message on the walls
told you that?

1408
01:14:55,855 --> 01:14:56,722
- Roger...
- No, no, no.

1409
01:14:56,755 --> 01:14:58,757
Secrets, secrets,
are no fun, right, guys?

1410
01:14:58,791 --> 01:15:01,827
- Stop.
- I fucked her sophomore year!

1411
01:15:01,861 --> 01:15:03,829
Yeah, when you two
were together.

1412
01:15:03,863 --> 01:15:05,064
Ask her.

1413
01:15:05,097 --> 01:15:07,166
Go ahead, tell him.

1414
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:11,837
- Tell him, Logan!
- Roger!

1415
01:15:11,871 --> 01:15:13,806
You cheated on me?

1416
01:15:13,839 --> 01:15:16,142
It was complicated.

1417
01:15:16,175 --> 01:15:17,443
How?

1418
01:15:17,476 --> 01:15:18,844
What about Andy?

1419
01:15:18,878 --> 01:15:20,045
Don't you think
something like this

1420
01:15:20,079 --> 01:15:21,080
could hurt your best friend?

1421
01:15:21,113 --> 01:15:23,282
Please, she never liked Roger,
not even when...

1422
01:15:23,315 --> 01:15:25,151
When what?

1423
01:15:29,755 --> 01:15:31,924
No, no, when what?
You stopped yourself.

1424
01:15:31,957 --> 01:15:34,059
I can't believe
I came here for you.

1425
01:15:38,464 --> 01:15:39,365
I wanted to start over.

1426
01:15:39,398 --> 01:15:41,267
I wanted you
to come back to Seattle with me.

1427
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:43,035
- To start over?
- Yeah, start over.

1428
01:15:52,077 --> 01:15:55,181
Leaving you was
the worst decision of my life.

1429
01:15:55,214 --> 01:15:58,717
Only took you a whopping five
years to figure that out, huh?

1430
01:15:58,751 --> 01:16:00,186
So convenient. Congratulations.

1431
01:16:00,219 --> 01:16:02,888
Gil, stop! Gil!

1432
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:11,997
Whoa, Gil, stop!

1433
01:16:12,031 --> 01:16:13,065
Stop!

1434
01:16:13,098 --> 01:16:16,035
Stop it! Gil!

1435
01:16:16,068 --> 01:16:18,103
Stop it!

1436
01:16:18,137 --> 01:16:19,438
Stop!

1437
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:29,315
James.

1438
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:33,152
Have you been down here
the whole time?

1439
01:16:33,185 --> 01:16:34,787
What are you doing
with that knife?

1440
01:16:58,043 --> 01:16:59,478
- You.
- Andy.

1441
01:16:59,511 --> 01:17:01,213
It was you this whole time.

1442
01:17:01,247 --> 01:17:02,481
You brought us here.

1443
01:17:02,514 --> 01:17:04,083
Andy, why are you covered
in blood?

1444
01:17:04,116 --> 01:17:06,785
Because you want to destroy
our fucking lives.

1445
01:17:06,819 --> 01:17:08,520
Why, why would you do this?

1446
01:17:08,554 --> 01:17:09,955
Whose blood is that?

1447
01:17:09,989 --> 01:17:11,290
Why don't you tell me?

1448
01:17:11,323 --> 01:17:13,359
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1449
01:17:13,392 --> 01:17:15,294
Seriously?
You're gonna play innocent

1450
01:17:15,327 --> 01:17:17,496
after all the little
fucked-up things you did to us?

1451
01:17:17,529 --> 01:17:19,031
I swear I didn't do any of this!

1452
01:17:19,064 --> 01:17:22,167
- Why would I do any of this?
- Because you know!

1453
01:17:23,135 --> 01:17:26,572
- You know my secret.
- Your secret, what?

1454
01:17:30,109 --> 01:17:32,011
- Her baby.
- What?

1455
01:17:32,044 --> 01:17:33,979
Don't fucking do that!

1456
01:17:34,013 --> 01:17:35,881
Call it what it is, an abortion.

1457
01:17:35,914 --> 01:17:37,349
- You were pregnant?
- Okay, hold on.

1458
01:17:37,383 --> 01:17:39,351
No, you know how much
this hurt me.

1459
01:17:39,385 --> 01:17:41,086
No, no, I know
what this looks like.

1460
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,488
- No, wait!
- Tell them it's all you.

1461
01:17:42,521 --> 01:17:44,123
- Tell us, Logan.
- It's not! I didn't...

1462
01:17:44,156 --> 01:17:47,860
- Why are you lying?
- It's not me!

1463
01:17:47,893 --> 01:17:50,396
You're the only one who knew.

1464
01:17:53,265 --> 01:17:55,567
No.

1465
01:17:55,601 --> 01:17:58,604
I wasn't the only one who knew.

1466
01:17:58,638 --> 01:18:02,074
- You what?
- What are you talking about?

1467
01:18:02,107 --> 01:18:03,842
I told Zach.

1468
01:18:07,346 --> 01:18:09,448
After your appointment,
I didn't want you to be alone

1469
01:18:09,481 --> 01:18:11,383
when I went to class,
so I told him.

1470
01:18:11,417 --> 01:18:14,486
- No.
- He knew, he's always known.

1471
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:19,391
No.

1472
01:18:23,929 --> 01:18:25,931
Zach, what is going on?

1473
01:18:28,901 --> 01:18:31,537
I knew if anyone was gonna
figure it out, it'd be you.

1474
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:33,339
Wow, well done.

1475
01:18:33,372 --> 01:18:34,506
Wow!

1476
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:36,008
Three days, that's good.

1477
01:18:36,041 --> 01:18:38,510
- Is this a prank?
- No, it wasn't a prank.

1478
01:18:38,544 --> 01:18:40,946
Not some serial killer,
it wasn't ghosts,

1479
01:18:40,979 --> 01:18:42,281
but that was a very good guess.

1480
01:18:42,314 --> 01:18:44,483
This is what I would call
an intervention.

1481
01:18:44,516 --> 01:18:46,318
- You did all this?
- I did all...

1482
01:18:46,352 --> 01:18:47,886
No... yes and no.

1483
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,923
I influenced a lot,
do not get me wrong,

1484
01:18:50,956 --> 01:18:53,225
but the rest was entirely
of your own doing.

1485
01:18:53,258 --> 01:18:55,427
A few texts sent here and there,

1486
01:18:55,461 --> 01:18:56,962
a vague and threatening message,

1487
01:18:56,995 --> 01:18:59,398
an anonymous letter,
taking you all here.

1488
01:18:59,431 --> 01:19:01,333
A little bit of fake blood
for you, my love,

1489
01:19:01,367 --> 01:19:02,901
and then I watched
the rest unfold.

1490
01:19:02,935 --> 01:19:06,338
I sat back and watched
all of you fucking snap!

1491
01:19:06,372 --> 01:19:07,674
You all went insane.

1492
01:19:07,707 --> 01:19:10,075
You, little by little,
one by one,

1493
01:19:10,109 --> 01:19:11,977
pawns in my chess game, broke!

1494
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:14,513
James, you fucking broke
Gil's hand!

1495
01:19:14,546 --> 01:19:16,081
That's goddamn awesome!

1496
01:19:16,115 --> 01:19:17,950
- James.
- James, please calm down.

1497
01:19:17,983 --> 01:19:20,152
Do not calm down.
James, do not calm down,

1498
01:19:20,185 --> 01:19:22,421
because this next part, I have
a special guest appearance.

1499
01:19:22,454 --> 01:19:25,023
It's your wife, and she's
gonna love this next part.

1500
01:19:25,057 --> 01:19:26,492
- Rowan!
- My wife is dead!

1501
01:19:29,027 --> 01:19:30,562
What did you say?

1502
01:19:32,564 --> 01:19:34,433
My wife is dead.

1503
01:19:34,466 --> 01:19:36,135
My God, Zach.

1504
01:19:36,168 --> 01:19:37,704
- No.
- Zach!

1505
01:19:37,737 --> 01:19:40,305
No, I...
no one was supposed to die!

1506
01:19:40,339 --> 01:19:42,274
- Oh my God.
- She was not supposed to die.

1507
01:19:42,307 --> 01:19:44,443
- You killed my wife.
- I killed her?

1508
01:19:44,476 --> 01:19:45,944
I didn't touch her.

1509
01:19:47,045 --> 01:19:49,114
I did.

1510
01:19:49,148 --> 01:19:50,382
I did!

1511
01:19:50,416 --> 01:19:53,452
James, what are you
talking about, man?

1512
01:19:55,755 --> 01:19:58,090
I shoved her
and killed my wife.

1513
01:19:58,123 --> 01:19:59,726
Fuck.

1514
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:06,432
James...

1515
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,169
I'm sorry.

1516
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:12,438
That's...

1517
01:20:12,471 --> 01:20:14,573
You're so pathetic.

1518
01:20:14,606 --> 01:20:15,675
Look at you!

1519
01:20:15,708 --> 01:20:17,710
The fuck are you laughing?

1520
01:20:20,078 --> 01:20:21,613
- I'm sorry.
- This is your fault.

1521
01:20:21,648 --> 01:20:22,749
No, it's not.

1522
01:20:22,782 --> 01:20:24,450
I never laid my hands on her.

1523
01:20:24,483 --> 01:20:25,752
- That was all you.
- Shut up.

1524
01:20:25,785 --> 01:20:28,320
Hey, I didn't lay
my hands on her.

1525
01:20:28,353 --> 01:20:30,355
- That was you, you hit her.
- Shut up, shut up!

1526
01:20:30,389 --> 01:20:32,491
Was it off an impulse,
or did you do it slow?

1527
01:20:32,524 --> 01:20:34,560
Shut up, I'll kill you
right now, I swear to God.

1528
01:20:34,593 --> 01:20:37,296
I swear to God,
I'll fucking kill you, Zach.

1529
01:20:37,329 --> 01:20:39,298
I swear to God.

1530
01:20:39,331 --> 01:20:41,467
Okay.

1531
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:42,601
Easy, tiger.

1532
01:20:42,635 --> 01:20:45,270
I got you, it's okay.

1533
01:20:45,304 --> 01:20:46,673
Do it.

1534
01:20:46,706 --> 01:20:48,207
Okay?

1535
01:20:49,776 --> 01:20:50,777
Do it.

1536
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:53,612
- Hey, hey, it's okay.
- James, grab that gun.

1537
01:20:53,646 --> 01:20:56,582
- Don't. Gil, stop.
- Take it. Take it.

1538
01:20:56,615 --> 01:20:59,218
- Grab the gun from him, James.
- No.

1539
01:20:59,251 --> 01:21:01,053
- James, stop!
- There you go, there you go.

1540
01:21:01,086 --> 01:21:02,387
- Shoot him, shoot him.
- No, no, no, no!

1541
01:21:02,421 --> 01:21:04,122
James, please do it,
you said you wanted to do it,

1542
01:21:04,156 --> 01:21:05,591
I'm giving you the opportunity,
please do it.

1543
01:21:05,624 --> 01:21:08,227
Don't kill him,
please don't kill him, please.

1544
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:09,696
- What are you doing, man?
- He wants this,

1545
01:21:09,729 --> 01:21:11,096
he's trying to get
inside your head.

1546
01:21:11,129 --> 01:21:12,297
I'm already inside
your head, James!

1547
01:21:12,331 --> 01:21:13,599
- Shut up.
- That's why you broke

1548
01:21:13,633 --> 01:21:15,668
your best friend's hand, that's
why you murdered your wife.

1549
01:21:15,702 --> 01:21:17,135
I have complete control
over you.

1550
01:21:17,169 --> 01:21:19,605
- Just fucking do it.
- Shut up, shut up!

1551
01:21:19,639 --> 01:21:22,074
Shut the fuck up, Zach,
I'll fucking kill you right now!

1552
01:21:22,107 --> 01:21:24,711
- I'm asking you to!
- Make it stop.

1553
01:21:24,744 --> 01:21:27,112
How long was she cheating
on you, James?

1554
01:21:27,145 --> 01:21:29,716
How long was she pretending
that she loved you?

1555
01:21:32,117 --> 01:21:33,619
Oh, she did tell him.

1556
01:21:33,653 --> 01:21:35,554
Guys.

1557
01:21:35,587 --> 01:21:37,289
He's taunting you, man,
shoot him!

1558
01:21:37,322 --> 01:21:39,091
Is that what made you kill her?

1559
01:21:39,124 --> 01:21:40,359
Shut up the fuck up, Zach.

1560
01:21:40,392 --> 01:21:41,460
Stop it.

1561
01:21:41,493 --> 01:21:43,428
James, he is taunting you,
shoot him!

1562
01:21:43,462 --> 01:21:45,364
I am taunting you,
and you should shoot me,

1563
01:21:45,397 --> 01:21:48,668
but listen, before you do,
did she confess anything else?

1564
01:21:48,701 --> 01:21:50,770
This is friend to friend,
I'm just asking.

1565
01:21:50,803 --> 01:21:53,372
Did she tell you what else
she was hiding from you?

1566
01:21:53,405 --> 01:21:55,240
- Stop it, Zach, please.
- James, listen to me.

1567
01:21:55,274 --> 01:21:56,676
- Listen to me.
- There was nothing else.

1568
01:21:56,709 --> 01:21:58,711
We surveyed
our audience here, okay?

1569
01:21:58,745 --> 01:22:00,512
- Shut up, Zach.
- And before tonight's broadcast,

1570
01:22:00,546 --> 01:22:02,214
survey says...

1571
01:22:03,850 --> 01:22:05,852
...she didn't want
to have your baby.

1572
01:22:05,885 --> 01:22:08,153
She never did.

1573
01:22:08,186 --> 01:22:09,789
Now, granted,
had things worked out

1574
01:22:09,822 --> 01:22:11,691
with you and Andy
back in college, maybe...

1575
01:22:11,724 --> 01:22:13,525
- Shut up!
- You're just letting him talk.

1576
01:22:13,559 --> 01:22:15,294
Shoot him!

1577
01:22:15,327 --> 01:22:17,195
Do it, do it.

1578
01:22:17,229 --> 01:22:18,397
Come on, please.

1579
01:22:18,430 --> 01:22:20,599
Fucking do it.

1580
01:22:20,633 --> 01:22:23,435
James, do it.

1581
01:22:23,468 --> 01:22:25,404
Please.

1582
01:22:25,437 --> 01:22:27,372
Motherfucker, fucking do it!

1583
01:22:27,406 --> 01:22:29,107
Pull the trigger!

1584
01:22:32,377 --> 01:22:33,612
- James.
- I'm not a murderer.

1585
01:22:33,646 --> 01:22:35,480
James.

1586
01:22:35,514 --> 01:22:37,115
- Neither was I.
- Zach...

1587
01:22:39,752 --> 01:22:41,520
Zach, no!

1588
01:22:41,553 --> 01:22:43,255
James!

1589
01:22:43,288 --> 01:22:44,623
James, stay with me!

1590
01:22:44,657 --> 01:22:46,124
Hey, hey, look at me!

1591
01:22:46,158 --> 01:22:47,426
James, James, look at me!

1592
01:22:47,459 --> 01:22:49,227
- James!
- You fucked it up!

1593
01:22:49,261 --> 01:22:51,430
You fucking idiot,
you fucked...

1594
01:22:51,463 --> 01:22:54,701
you fucked...
you fucked it up!

1595
01:22:54,734 --> 01:22:56,736
- Why?!
- Hey, hey, look at me.

1596
01:22:56,769 --> 01:22:58,871
Hey!

1597
01:23:00,439 --> 01:23:02,407
- James!
- You fuck...

1598
01:23:02,441 --> 01:23:03,743
You know, if you were
a real doctor,

1599
01:23:03,776 --> 01:23:05,544
you could probably save him,
it's a shame.

1600
01:23:10,415 --> 01:23:11,751
You fucking psychopath!

1601
01:23:11,784 --> 01:23:13,753
He wasn't supposed to die!

1602
01:23:13,786 --> 01:23:15,755
I didn't want anyone to die!

1603
01:23:15,788 --> 01:23:17,356
He was...

1604
01:23:17,389 --> 01:23:18,590
He fucking ruined everything.

1605
01:23:18,624 --> 01:23:20,525
He fucking...
he fucking ruined everything.

1606
01:23:20,559 --> 01:23:22,561
Zach, listen to me,
what is the point of this, Zach?

1607
01:23:22,594 --> 01:23:23,663
Two people are now dead.

1608
01:23:23,696 --> 01:23:26,231
Because no one
ever listens to me!

1609
01:23:26,264 --> 01:23:27,532
Because I'm Zach!

1610
01:23:27,566 --> 01:23:30,670
I'm kind, gentle, pushover Zach!

1611
01:23:30,703 --> 01:23:32,839
I'm everyone's shoulder
to cry on!

1612
01:23:32,872 --> 01:23:34,674
I'm everyone's secret-keeper!

1613
01:23:34,707 --> 01:23:36,676
I'm everyone's
fucking punching bag!

1614
01:23:36,709 --> 01:23:39,344
We trusted you, man,
we told you our secrets.

1615
01:23:39,378 --> 01:23:40,880
You should feel honored,
not fucking crazy.

1616
01:23:40,913 --> 01:23:44,182
Honored? Honored to know
that you slept consistently

1617
01:23:44,216 --> 01:23:46,686
with the only girl
I've ever been in love with,

1618
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:48,655
but you were supposed
to be my best friend?

1619
01:23:48,688 --> 01:23:51,658
- I stopped once you told me.
- You knew!

1620
01:23:53,258 --> 01:23:54,626
There's no way you didn't know.

1621
01:23:54,661 --> 01:23:56,261
Zach, please don't do this,
okay?

1622
01:23:56,294 --> 01:23:57,964
Why? Because you love him?

1623
01:23:57,997 --> 01:24:00,833
Who cares?
No one ever cared how I felt!

1624
01:24:00,867 --> 01:24:02,501
Okay, that's enough.

1625
01:24:02,534 --> 01:24:04,837
All of us knew
that you liked Andy.

1626
01:24:04,871 --> 01:24:08,775
- I mean, don't you think...
- Don't interrupt me!

1627
01:24:08,808 --> 01:24:12,310
It is my turn to fucking talk.

1628
01:24:12,344 --> 01:24:14,279
Why, why are you doing this?

1629
01:24:14,312 --> 01:24:15,580
Oh, why don't you
tell them, babe?

1630
01:24:15,614 --> 01:24:17,582
I think you know exactly
why I'm doing this.

1631
01:24:17,616 --> 01:24:19,484
- I didn't mean to.
- Stop crying!

1632
01:24:19,518 --> 01:24:21,520
Just tell them.

1633
01:24:21,553 --> 01:24:24,222
His wrists, look at his wrists.

1634
01:24:25,323 --> 01:24:29,294
You all abandoned me.

1635
01:24:29,327 --> 01:24:30,495
All of you.

1636
01:24:33,265 --> 01:24:35,768
I'm sorry.

1637
01:24:35,802 --> 01:24:37,369
- Your turn, Roger.
- What?

1638
01:24:37,402 --> 01:24:38,537
Come on, don't be bashful.

1639
01:24:38,570 --> 01:24:40,272
I'm not the only one
who's tried.

1640
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:44,443
- How did you know that?
- You tried to kill yourself?

1641
01:24:44,476 --> 01:24:45,477
Twice.

1642
01:24:47,312 --> 01:24:49,682
Yeah, I, uh...

1643
01:24:49,716 --> 01:24:51,516
I overdosed twice.

1644
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:53,418
Um, once on accident,

1645
01:24:53,452 --> 01:24:56,823
and the other on purpose,
last year.

1646
01:24:56,856 --> 01:24:58,758
- How did you know?
- You can try and transform

1647
01:24:58,791 --> 01:25:01,259
yourself into Gil all you want,
but I think deep down,

1648
01:25:01,293 --> 01:25:03,295
you're always gonna be
a sad, pathetic little junkie.

1649
01:25:03,328 --> 01:25:05,564
- Shut the fuck up!
- Zach, give me the gun!

1650
01:25:05,597 --> 01:25:09,501
Stop, stop, just stop trying
to save him.

1651
01:25:09,534 --> 01:25:11,637
You can't save guys like us.

1652
01:25:11,671 --> 01:25:13,806
Okay, okay, I get it.

1653
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,675
Okay, lesson learned.

1654
01:25:15,708 --> 01:25:18,911
Don't talk to me
like I'm a child.

1655
01:25:18,945 --> 01:25:21,047
- I'm not a fucking kid.
- I'm not talking to you

1656
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:24,449
like you're a child, Zach,
please, just listen!

1657
01:25:24,483 --> 01:25:27,053
James and Rowan,
their marriage was toxic, okay?

1658
01:25:27,086 --> 01:25:29,521
You said there was an affair,
right, there was an affair,

1659
01:25:29,554 --> 01:25:31,924
so I can... I can make it
all go away, okay?

1660
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:33,391
It's easy, it's easy, okay?

1661
01:25:33,425 --> 01:25:34,626
I can help you, Zach,
just let me...

1662
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:35,962
I don't want your help!

1663
01:25:35,995 --> 01:25:38,831
I don't need
your help now, Logan!

1664
01:25:38,865 --> 01:25:39,999
I did!

1665
01:25:40,032 --> 01:25:41,734
I would've loved it before!

1666
01:25:41,768 --> 01:25:43,836
But no!

1667
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:46,072
I called all of you

1668
01:25:46,105 --> 01:25:48,607
the day that...

1669
01:25:48,641 --> 01:25:50,342
None of you answered,

1670
01:25:50,375 --> 01:25:52,310
and I called all of you
three times,

1671
01:25:52,344 --> 01:25:54,981
and no one even called me back.

1672
01:25:55,014 --> 01:25:57,083
It's too late!

1673
01:25:58,617 --> 01:26:00,787
You guys are just too late.

1674
01:26:01,888 --> 01:26:03,790
- You're just too late.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1675
01:26:03,823 --> 01:26:06,993
Okay, you wanna shoot somebody,
man, shoot... shoot me.

1676
01:26:07,026 --> 01:26:08,593
Okay, it's my fucking fault.

1677
01:26:08,627 --> 01:26:10,830
I slept with Andy, I'm the one

1678
01:26:10,863 --> 01:26:11,998
who didn't tell Logan
how I felt.

1679
01:26:12,031 --> 01:26:14,332
I'm the only reason
we've been friends with Gil,

1680
01:26:14,366 --> 01:26:17,003
and with fucking James,
so just... just shoot me, man.

1681
01:26:17,036 --> 01:26:19,404
Just, please.

1682
01:26:19,437 --> 01:26:21,908
All I ever wanted was
for you guys to listen.

1683
01:26:23,910 --> 01:26:25,711
Andy, I loved you,

1684
01:26:25,745 --> 01:26:28,346
and you could've changed this
for everyone.

1685
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:29,481
Please, Zach.

1686
01:26:31,550 --> 01:26:34,452
Now you all have
one more secret to keep.

1687
01:26:37,757 --> 01:26:39,058
Please.

1688
01:26:51,137 --> 01:26:55,574
The seven of us have always been
a really deadly combination.

1689
01:27:29,175 --> 01:27:31,010
Oh my God.

1690
01:27:31,043 --> 01:27:33,713
- Oh my God, Zach, no.
- Andy, stop.

1691
01:27:34,881 --> 01:27:36,716
Andy, do not touch him.

1692
01:27:36,749 --> 01:27:39,618
- What?
- I said, do not touch him.

1693
01:27:39,652 --> 01:27:41,721
Back away.

1694
01:27:42,922 --> 01:27:44,690
Oh my God, oh my God.

1695
01:27:44,724 --> 01:27:47,592
Andy, I'm not gonna
tell you again.

1696
01:27:47,626 --> 01:27:49,896
Back up!

1697
01:27:49,929 --> 01:27:52,098
Get away from him.

1698
01:28:00,072 --> 01:28:01,974
Okay.

1699
01:28:02,008 --> 01:28:05,011
Okay, this is what
we're gonna do.

1700
01:28:05,044 --> 01:28:07,079
Andy, I need you to get up.

1701
01:28:07,113 --> 01:28:10,448
Andy, I need you to get up.
Get up, Andy. Get up!

1702
01:28:12,885 --> 01:28:15,453
I need you to go upstairs,
I need you to shower,

1703
01:28:15,487 --> 01:28:17,790
I need you to put those clothes
in a garbage bag, okay?

1704
01:28:17,823 --> 01:28:20,793
Gil, I have to wrap your arm,
we gotta stop the bleeding.

1705
01:28:20,826 --> 01:28:23,595
We gotta strip all the sheets,
we gotta start washing them.

1706
01:28:23,628 --> 01:28:25,197
Roger, you gotta collect
all the garbage, okay?

1707
01:28:25,231 --> 01:28:26,332
Any paper, any bottles,

1708
01:28:26,365 --> 01:28:28,668
anything lying around
that could trace us back here,

1709
01:28:28,701 --> 01:28:30,636
and I'm gonna start wiping down
all of the furniture

1710
01:28:30,670 --> 01:28:32,504
to get rid
of the fingerprints, okay?

1711
01:28:32,537 --> 01:28:33,873
I have gloves in my car.

1712
01:28:33,906 --> 01:28:36,474
Every single one of you
are wearing them!

1713
01:28:36,508 --> 01:28:39,544
Zach just killed himself,
Rowan and James are dead,

1714
01:28:39,577 --> 01:28:41,714
they're fucking dead!

1715
01:28:41,747 --> 01:28:43,515
You're right, they're dead,

1716
01:28:43,548 --> 01:28:45,651
so we have to protect ourselves.

1717
01:28:45,685 --> 01:28:47,552
No, we...

1718
01:28:47,585 --> 01:28:49,855
- We need to call the police.
- No.

1719
01:28:49,889 --> 01:28:51,589
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1720
01:28:51,623 --> 01:28:54,060
Listen to me,
we cannot call the police, okay?

1721
01:28:54,093 --> 01:28:55,861
Because if we call them
and we tell them

1722
01:28:55,895 --> 01:28:57,229
exactly how everything happened,

1723
01:28:57,263 --> 01:28:58,998
they're going to bring us in
for questioning

1724
01:28:59,031 --> 01:29:01,267
and we're gonna remain guilty
until proven innocent,

1725
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:05,638
and they will still pin it
on one of us,

1726
01:29:05,671 --> 01:29:08,240
and I'm not going to jail.

1727
01:29:12,678 --> 01:29:14,914
Okay?

1728
01:29:14,947 --> 01:29:17,683
Is anyone else still opposed?

1729
01:29:25,057 --> 01:29:27,727
All righty then.

1730
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,729
Let's start cleaning.

1731
01:29:37,803 --> 01:29:38,871
No.

1732
01:29:38,904 --> 01:29:41,007
Fuck! Fuck!

1733
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,175
Oh God.

1734
01:29:43,209 --> 01:29:45,011
You can still tie it up.

1735
01:29:48,647 --> 01:29:53,551
You see, humans are
extremely simple creatures...

1736
01:29:57,089 --> 01:29:59,825
...each individually formulated

1737
01:29:59,859 --> 01:30:03,195
by a mixture
of both light and dark,

1738
01:30:03,229 --> 01:30:06,098
good and evil.

1739
01:30:06,132 --> 01:30:09,135
Most are balanced of the two,

1740
01:30:09,168 --> 01:30:13,239
and the others... not.

1741
01:30:13,272 --> 01:30:16,275
But then there are the immoral,

1742
01:30:16,308 --> 01:30:20,179
the message, the warnings
to the rectifiable,

1743
01:30:20,212 --> 01:30:23,749
although forgiven by God
are damned to a life

1744
01:30:23,783 --> 01:30:28,054
of predetermined torment
by their sin,

1745
01:30:28,087 --> 01:30:34,260
consumed by a life
of only wrong decisions.

1746
01:30:34,293 --> 01:30:38,164
The glutton, no temperance.

1747
01:30:38,197 --> 01:30:41,133
The greedy, no charity.

1748
01:30:41,167 --> 01:30:44,303
The wrath, no patience.

1749
01:30:44,336 --> 01:30:48,240
The envious, no kindness.

1750
01:30:48,274 --> 01:30:52,678
The lustful, no self-control.

1751
01:30:52,711 --> 01:30:56,715
The sloth, no zeal.

1752
01:30:56,749 --> 01:31:00,386
And the proud,

1753
01:31:00,419 --> 01:31:03,089
no humility.

1754
01:31:05,357 --> 01:31:07,726
No happiness.

1755
01:31:10,029 --> 01:31:11,263
No virtues.

1756
01:31:16,802 --> 01:31:18,170
No end.

1757
01:31:22,908 --> 01:31:25,344
The story will never end.

1758
01:31:30,015 --> 01:31:32,184
- Zach?
- Yeah.

1759
01:31:33,752 --> 01:31:35,788
How are they healing?

1760
