00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,887
- Joe?
- Yes?

3
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,009
It's Gloria.

4
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,428
- Gloria...
- Gloria Bell.

5
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,929
Oh. Hi, how are you?

6
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,059
- Good, how are you?
- I'm good.

7
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,192
How long has it been?

8
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,526
Oh, gosh, 10 or 12 years at least.

9
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,524
Since my divorce, probably.

10
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,446
Right. Right.

11
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:41,151
- Well, you look good.
- Thanks. So do you.

12
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,194
Cheers.

13
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,650
Oh.

14
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,780
How did you get in here again?

15
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,667
All right. Go home!

16
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,209
Go home!

17
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,358
I gave you everything!

18
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,222
Everything!

19
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,468
What for, huh?

20
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,763
What for? What for?

21
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,108
What are you looking at, huh?

22
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,688
Are you going to tell me what to do?

23
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,696
You know nothing, Dad!

24
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,402
You don't know shit, man!

25
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,997
Nobody knows anything!

She said the light was yellow.

34
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,242
Oh, no, I doubt that she's color-blind.

35
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,665
Was there injury involved?

36
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,493
Well, how about the other driver?

37
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,205
Is it Robert Cox?

38
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,670
Oh, no. That's fantastic!

39
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,427
Well, that's the most important thing,
that everybody's safe,

40
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,851
because it's just a car,
and that's what we're here for.

41
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,145
No, I'm sure that you paid
your premium on time.

42
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,566
Uh, but I will check on that,
and I'll get right back to you.

43
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,269
Hi, Anne, honey.

44
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,650
Um, I haven't heard from you in a while,

45
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,949
so I thought I'd give you a call
and see what's going on.

46
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,196
Um...

47
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,653
It's pretty busy here
at the office, but just,

48
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:34,161
you know, call me anytime
if you feel like it. Okay?

49
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,662
I love you.

50
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,833
It's your mother.

51
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,290
Hi, Peter.

52
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,713
It's Mom.

53
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,507
Just, um...
Just calling to see how Hugo is feeling

54
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,882
and if you guys need any help or anything.

55
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,213
Um, that's it.

56
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,965
I love you.

57
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,470
It's your mother.

58
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:53,805
Oh, you doing again?

59
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,457
- Put it back on.
- I should put him down.

60
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,834
Oh, I can do it. I'll put him down.

61
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,350
No, no. I'll do it. It's gonna be faster.

62
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,921
- Oh. Go with Daddy.
- Come on, buddy.

63
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,278
- Go to Daddy. Okay.
- Come on.

64
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,884
- See you later, Nana.
- See you later.

65
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,235
See you later.

66
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,486
Okay.

67
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,781
Oh, God.

68
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,125
Have you heard from Rachel?

69
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,968
She's in the desert. That's all I know.

70
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,091
She's finding herself in the desert.

71
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,256
- I see.
- Yeah.

72
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,603
- He's fussy, isn't he?
- Yeah.

73
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,440
Do you think he still has
that ear infection?

74
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,519
Uh, I don't know. I don't think so.

75
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,729
Did you give him an antibiotic?

76
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,564
Yeah, we gave him antibiotics.

77
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,237
I mean, it could be bad.

78
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,695
He could be having a reaction
to the antibiotics.

79
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,141
I mean, you know...

80
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,578
...sometimes it gives him
a stomachache or, um,

81
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:02,162
a lot of diaper rash,
or even a, um, even a fungus.

82
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,900
There's this white stuff.

83
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,291
It's called thrush, in their mouth.

84
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,591
Um...

85
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,260
Did you... Did you check in his mouth?

86
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:12,846
- Did you? Did you?
- No.

87
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,410
- Did you open his...
- I don't think...

88
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,141
Sorry.

89
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,968
Hey, Rachel.

90
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,975
Yeah. It's so awesome of you to call.

91
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,601
It's really great. Thank you.

92
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,770
It's so nice of you to check on us.

93
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,361
Yeah, he's eating and... Yeah.

94
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,067
His poops have been very dark and solid.

95
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:34,952
Where are you?

96
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,622
No, he's not asking about his mother!
He doesn't speak!

97
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,915
<i>Uttanasana</i>. Facing forward.

98
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:45,872
Concave back.

99
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,626
Extending over the legs,
taking hands in line with the feet.

100
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,555
Press the palms together...

101
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:58,888
And look up.

102
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,477
Take your elbows close to your body.

103
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,775
Raise your knees, raise your thighs.

104
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,402
Well done.

105
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,612
Good job, Gloria.

106
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,198
Thank you, everybody.

107
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,790
Bye.

108
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,950
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

109
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,750
- You did really well.
- You think so?

110
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:24,981
Yeah, you should come more often.

111
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,621
- I would love that.
- Bye. Thanks.

112
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,081
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

113
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,632
Excuse me.
Everybody really loved the class.

114
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,085
- Oh, yeah?
- I can tell, yes.

115
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,379
All right.

116
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,932
- Shall we go?
- Yeah, let's go.

117
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,136
Uh, Theo! Come here.

118
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,971
Theo, this is my mom.

119
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,935
- Hi!
- Mom, this is Theo.

120
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,358
It's nice to meet you.

121
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,562
Anne has told me a lot about you.
It's really nice to meet you.

122
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,237
It's nice to meet you too.

123
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,814
- Where are you from?
- Sweden.

124
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,570
- Yeah?
- He's a big wave surfer.

125
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,494
Yeah. I go around the world
looking for giant waves.

126
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,788
- Oh!
- And I'm on my way to Oahu.

127
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:05,539
So I stopped here to surf the wedge
in Newport and see Anne, of course.

128
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,120
- Oh. Of course.
- And she's...

129
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,299
She's a spectacular woman and very nice.

130
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,446
Oh, well, yes.

131
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,506
We've gotta go.

132
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,132
- Do you practice a lot?
- Um, no.

133
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,633
Actually, this is my first time.

134
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,841
Um, what about you?
Do you practice yoga often?

135
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,550
I tried to, since I was 15.

136
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,637
Oh, my goodness, that's, um...
That's early to start, isn't it?

137
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,375
Okay, Mom, we're leaving.

138
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,356
Oh, okay. Have fun.

139
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,443
- Take care.
- Yeah.

140
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,938
- Bye.
- Oh!

141
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,646
- Nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.

142
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,653
- All good?
- Bye.

143
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,408
- Bye. Call me, okay?
- Yes.

144
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,815
Anyone coming?

145
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,392
- I said I quit.
- Yeah, me too.

146
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:12,522
But...

147
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,230
I saw that huge drop in my 401.

148
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,951
And I asked the human-resources guy
and he said,

149
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,871
"Oh, um, this is just due to the market.
It's normal."

150
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,620
I can't even begin
to understand the stock market.

151
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,420
The amount of money
that I'm gonna get is bullshit!

152
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,338
Believe me, I get it. I get it.

153
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,713
And I'm only getting
this bullshit amount of money

154
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,511
if I make it to full retirement
in five years.

155
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,912
I'm gonna be working in my eighties.

156
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,394
I know. If it all goes to hell,
we can be roommates, okay?

157
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,850
- Gloria, I'm fucked.
- Now, hey, you know what?

158
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,650
If they fuck with you, they fuck with me.

159
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,693
We're in this together. Right?

160
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,818
Hey! Hey, you fuckers!

161
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,615
This woman is awesome!

162
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:01,660
Treat her right!

163
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,777
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

164
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:06,239
She's a good woman, she's a good friend.
Respect her!

165
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,699
She works her ass off, you fuckers!

166
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:09,909
Yeah, fuckers!

Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

173
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,613
No, no. Have a seat.

174
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,123
- Gloria.
- Stanley.

175
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,792
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

176
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,710
- Hi.
- Hi. Michelle.

177
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,128
Very nice to meet you.

178
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,375
Pat. Pat Banowsky.

179
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:00,877
Pat Banowsky.

180
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,506
- You're good at that.
- Thanks.

181
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,090
Can I ask you a question?
I hope you don't mind.

182
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,891
No, I don't mind.

183
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,019
Have you had work done?

184
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,351
No.

185
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,274
- Really? Really?
- Thanks, though.

186
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,151
Pardon me. Shall we?

187
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,208
- See you around.
- Mm-hmm.

188
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,006
Are you always this happy?

189
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,027
Uh, no.

190
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,402
Oh. Uh, you asked me
and I laugh, that's all.

191
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,156
No.

192
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,074
Some days, I'm happy.

193
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,961
Some days, I'm not.

194
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,586
Like everyone.

195
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,383
- Like everyone.
- Mm-hmm.

196
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,131
Do you come here a lot?

197
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,766
Yes.

198
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,263
Uh... Yes, I'm...

199
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:18,973
No, not a lot. I mean, um, sometimes.

200
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,400
When I feel like it.

201
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,690
When I can.

202
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,620
I like coming here, though.
I like to dance.

203
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,872
By yourself?

204
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:36,994
By myself.

205
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,916
I'm divorced.

206
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,498
So am I.

207
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:45,458
Oh, really?

208
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,387
How long?

209
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,175
One year.

210
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,844
Recently.

211
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,426
- Finally.
- Well, yes.

212
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,682
Sometimes it's finally, isn't it?

213
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,685
I'm trying to... change things.

214
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,941
Life.

215
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,116
What's your name?

216
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,033
Gloria.

217
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,807
What's this?

218
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,310
Just take it off.

219
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,231
Yeah, um, it's, uh...

220
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,435
It's... It's 500.

221
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,484
No, I know... No, I know. I know.

222
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,941
It's a lot,
but you are covered for a rental

223
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,697
the entire time your car is in the shop.

224
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,115
Well, I can... I can arrange

225
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,419
for you to get into a rental vehicle.
I'll just...

226
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,244
I'll give them all the information

227
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,751
and I'll tell you where...

228
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,376
...you can pick it up.

229
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,042
Um...

230
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,717
Or better yet,

231
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:38,889
I'm gonna have them
deliver it to you, okay?

232
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,551
No, it's... No...

233
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,011
It's no trouble at all. I can handle it.

234
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,722
Believe me. Anything you need,
I'm here for you, okay?

235
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,065
I love cats.

236
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,901
- How does it get in?
- I have no idea.

237
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,571
I shut everything up
and that little fucker still gets in.

238
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,990
Mm. Maybe it's trying
to tell you something.

239
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,695
It's like a... It's like a dead thing.
It's like an Egyptian mummy cat.

240
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,289
Oh, like a sphinx?

241
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,997
It doesn't have any hair, Veronica.

242
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:08,168
There's a beautiful story about cats
in the Bible.

243
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,120
Oh, no, please... Ow! Ow!

244
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,205
- Do you want more than that?
- Excuse me?

245
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,541
Do you want more off the sides?

246
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,968
Uh, no. I think I just want it regular,
I don't want...

247
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,970
A little bit more than that,
actually, thanks.

248
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:27,976
So, uh, when the big flood came,
God told Noah to build a huge ark.

249
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,272
And he brought his family.

250
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,934
And two kinds of animals
from every species

251
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,815
that existed in the world back then.

252
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,112
- Mmm-hmm.
- And soon there were just

253
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,942
a ton of mice
and they were eating all the food.

254
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,493
And Noah didn't know what to do.

255
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,912
So he asked God and God said,

256
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:48,083
"Go find the lion, pet its head like this.

257
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,626
Three times." And the lion went...

258
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:57,631
Just letting out a gush of air
and two cats came out of its nose.

259
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,921
Those cats got rid of the mice.

260
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:06,344
And so order and balance
were re-established in the world.

261
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,686
Ow! Ow.

262
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:09,889
Sorry, sweetie.

263
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,725
And we're gonna
hit our ribs softly like this.

264
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,727
And we're gonna count one, two, three!

265
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,109
Again!

266
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:43,173
Your father,
God bless him, left me just enough.

267
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,631
And, no...

268
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,844
No, I don't...
I don't spend much other than...

269
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:53,774
Well, okay. I do like to come here
with my girlfriends and have my salad,

270
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,942
- but other than that...
- No. I know, yeah.

271
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,155
It's just that I could live too long.

272
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:05,448
I just don't think there's gonna be
much left once I'm gone.

273
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,370
I don't need anything.

274
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,698
I've been paying my own bills
for a long time now.

275
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,209
You won't even know it.

276
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,958
You're gonna wake up one morning
and you'll find yourself

277
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,630
a wrinkled old lady just like me.

278
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,050
You're not old. You look beautiful.

279
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,344
You do. You really do.

280
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,594
Because life just goes by in a flash.

281
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,765
Like that.

282
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,970
I know. You tell me
the same thing every ten years.

283
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:35,057
- Do you see what I mean?
- I know, Mom.

284
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,651
- You'll be fine.
- Of course I will.

285
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,862
At least you quit smoking, thank God.

286
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,190
Ladies.

287
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:46,777
I'll just... I'll take that,
thank you very much.

288
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,912
Gloria Bell. Your tenant in apartment two.

289
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:56,040
I live below your son, Mrs. Duffy.

290
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:00,545
Yes. That's...
That's actually why I'm calling,

291
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:05,846
and I'm so sorry to bother you
so late at night, um...

292
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,763
- But, you know, I...
- Come here!

293
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:12,845
I work and I have to get up
early in the morning, you know, so...

294
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,600
Why be born?

295
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,976
Yes, yes, exactly,

296
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:19,559
and I hate to be the one
to tell you this, but are you...

297
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,820
Are you aware of what's happening?

298
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,843
I just... Your son is...

299
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,904
I think your son is having
some kind of a...

300
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,681
- Some kind of a breakdown.
<i>- Is he there with you?</i>

301
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,705
No.

302
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,660
It's all fucked up! Don't go outside!

303
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,083
It breaks my heart.

304
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:39,914
I mean, honestly...
I mean, I'm a mom too, so I...

305
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,545
I wanna die! I wanna die!

306
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,134
He needs help.

307
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,592
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

308
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:52,301
I'm sorry, I hate to do this,
but please, please listen.

309
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,137
Listen.

310
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,188
Don't be born, man!

311
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,515
Don't be born!

312
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,609
Don't be born!

313
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,124
Hello?

314
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,330
Uh, no, this is she.

315
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:30,346
No, I'm not mad. Why would I be mad?

316
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,939
Are you asking me out?

317
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:48,908
Thank you.

318
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,659
You're such a gentleman.

319
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:54,658
I can't get you out of my head.

320
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,748
I...

321
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,750
I'm really...
I'm constantly thinking about you.

322
00:22:58,836 --> 00:22:59,836
You're just so...

323
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:03,834
different.

324
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,620
What happened to me with you, I...

325
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,848
I thought it was never gonna happen again.

326
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,305
My head is still spinning.

327
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,054
I didn't dare...

328
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,395
It was driving me crazy.
I mean I wanted to,

329
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:27,146
but I was too nervous to call you.

330
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,447
But I went for it, thank God.

331
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,900
So, thank you.

332
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,120
Thank you for coming.

333
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,281
You're very welcome.

334
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,995
Ah.

335
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,295
It's okay. Go ahead.

336
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,050
- Excuse me, would you?
- Yeah, please, it's okay.

337
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,504
Hello? Hello. Hello, Suzanne.

338
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,392
Okay. Fine, but...

339
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:01,513
There's no reason to cry about it.

340
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,768
Um...

341
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,397
I... I'm gonna do it before 2:00. Okay?

342
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,270
What?

343
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,105
Yes, I'll make the deposit before 2:00.

344
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,857
I'm busy now.

345
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,401
Just relax.

346
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,455
Bye.

347
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,532
Mm.

348
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:25,246
- So, are you divorced or not?
- I am. I am.

349
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:26,963
Hmm, but...

350
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,818
You get divorced from the woman,
not the kids.

351
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,083
- Ah.
- Yes.

352
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,385
I've been living alone now for a year.

353
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:37,011
But I still have to help out
the girls a lot.

354
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:40,560
They're... They're very dependent on me.

355
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:47,067
It's just the way things are,
so, you know...

356
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,486
It's not all of me, but it's a part of me.

357
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,190
My life used to be very different.

358
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:58,495
I was drowning, about to blow and then...

359
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,332
About a year and a month ago,
I had surgery.

360
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:04,751
What kind of surgery?

361
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,412
Gastric bypass.

362
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,299
- I used to weigh 280 pounds.
- I don't believe you.

363
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,085
- I swear.
- No.

364
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,919
- It's true.
- No. I... I...

365
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,550
I was huge, really.

366
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,472
If you don't believe me, here you go.

367
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,766
All right, all right.

368
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,223
See? Look at that, see?

369
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,691
- I had a size 52 waist.
- I'm sorry.

370
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,858
Very little neck.

371
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,777
I'm sorry. I'm...

372
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,794
Oh... Whoa. Whoa!

373
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,470
I got you. I got you.

374
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,514
Okay. Okay.

375
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:02,308
Oh. Oh!

376
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,057
This is the hopper,
where the paintballs go in.

377
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:09,812
- Okay.
- This is the pod with 140 paintballs.

378
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,646
And now you take the gun.

379
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,089
- You want me to hold it?
- Yeah, okay.

380
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:16,231
You put your hand there
and this hand around here.

381
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:17,406
- Okay. Mmm-hmm.
- Okay?

382
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:18,779
- You got it?
- I have it.

383
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,532
This is the trigger. All right? Okay?

384
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:24,456
This is the safety. Take the safety off.

385
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,749
Now it's an automatic.
Okay, now be careful.

386
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,063
- Do you want me to shoot?
- Not yet.

387
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:31,546
Look through the sight, okay? All right.

388
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,248
- A little more...
- Okay.

389
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,083
- A little more at the target.
- At the guy.

390
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,293
- Right. Okay?
- At the guy.

391
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,781
- You can see him, right?
- Yes, I can see him.

392
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,546
- Okay? And...
- Okay. And...

393
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,718
- You hit the bull's-eye.
- I think he's dead.

394
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,599
I love your park.

395
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:51,433
You know, men,
they like to play war.

396
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,609
I do know that.

397
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:00,609
Capturing the flag.

398
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,453
Protecting the president.

399
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,369
- Zombie attack.
- Hmm.

400
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,181
Hmm.

412

It's this weird mix of happiness and...

413
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,403
And anxiety. I've...

414
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,194
I've never felt anything like this before.

415
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,238
I think it's called love, honey.

416
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,366
- Oh, my God!
- It's fine, Mom.

417
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:17,086
- He gets paid to do this?
- Yeah. It's his job.

418
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,628
He's a big wave surfer,
like an extreme surfer.

419
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,876
It's what he loves to do.

420
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,050
Honey, this guy could die tomorrow.

421
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,974
Mom. We could all die tomorrow.

422
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,224
I just saw on the news
where they sent a boy home

423
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,102
for just making a gun with his hand.

424
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,935
Oh, wow. You cannot stop boys
from playing with guns.

425
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:43,146
And if they don't have one,
they're gonna make everything into a gun.

426
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,717
When Peter was little,
he went into my purse

427
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,357
and made a gun out of a tampon.

428
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,662
Yeah. What was the trigger?

429
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,835
See, we can't even outlaw guns
in our own families.

430
00:29:58,255 --> 00:29:59,255
That's true.

431
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:04,922
But the fact that a civilian can just walk
in and buy a military-style assault rifle

432
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:05,970
is just beyond me.

433
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:09,681
Well, the majority of gun owners
are responsible.

434
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,661
This is not about the majority.

435
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:14,393
The responsibility
that you're referring to

436
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,311
is what is going to blow up
the whole planet.

437
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,856
The planet is as good
as blown-up already, my dear.

438
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:22,811
We're just arranged in the deck chairs
on the Titanic at this point.

439
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,816
- Mmm-hmm.
- I don't think we should panic.

440
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,816
Everything goes in cycles. It's natural.

441
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:32,449
Besides, every generation thinks
it's the end. The worst it's ever been.

442
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:36,120
And one generation will be right.

443
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:40,871
Well, when the world blows up,
I hope I go down dancing.

444
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,047
Hey-hey!

445
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:44,374
- Right?
- Yes!

446
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:13,988
Because everything is changing,
it's transforming.

447
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,623
All the time. Even our physical bodies.

448
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:22,165
I was reading in the science section
of the paper about cell renewal.

449
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,459
Do you know about that?

450
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,582
Yeah. Yeah, I've heard something.

451
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:32,468
Basically, it said that, um, our bodies,

452
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,765
even middle-aged bodies,

453
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,888
are less than ten years old.

454
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:41,939
Our skin. The epidermis
is recycled every two weeks.

455
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:47,771
Our bones, the human skeleton
is replaced every ten years.

456
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:52,529
And each organ, you know,
renews itself at a separate rate

457
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,576
and so everything is...

00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:30,881
If I were a peach, you'd be a tree.

480
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,003
And if you were a tree, I'd be your sap.

481
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:39,966
And I'd course through your arms
like blood.

482
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,428
And if I were blood,

483
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,599
I'd live in your heart."

484
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,254
Hello?

485
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,837
Helen. Uh...

486
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,340
Hello. How are you?

487
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,970
Good. How about you?

488
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:29,391
That's nice.

489
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,605
Yes.

490
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,984
I've already had lunch.

491
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,076
Well, she should take her pills.

492
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,492
What's that?

493
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,999
Hey, what can I do about it?

494
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,243
I'm here at home.

495
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,921
I haven't been feeling well.
That's why I haven't been out.

496
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:54,878
What? No...

497
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:57,130
No, I'm not going out today.
I'm staying here.

498
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:58,882
Okay?

499
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,131
Okay? No, I don't think so.

500
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,055
Did you like it?

501
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,852
I don't understand, really.

502
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,068
Where are you?

503
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,021
Why are you here?

504
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,107
Because I'm with you.

505
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,192
Then why can't you tell them
that you're with me?

506
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:24,161
Why? I don't want to involve them
in our thing. No way.

507
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,950
No way. Why drag them into a situation
that they're incapable of understanding?

508
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:32,253
Why? So they can say,
"Oh, my God, you have a girlfriend?

509
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,376
- You stupid old man."
- You're not old.

510
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,799
"How could you even think
of dating at your age?"

511
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,672
It... They...

512
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,628
I know them. They'd make fun of me and...

513
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,013
Why give them the chance?

514
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,761
I thought that, you know...

515
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:46,968
Um...

516
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,894
I'm a part of your life, aren't I?

517
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,958
You're the most important part of my life.

518
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,475
Well, I wanna feel that, and if you're
lying to your daughters, then I'm not.

519
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,316
- They're grown-ups, right?
- They're not that grown up.

520
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:02,491
I mean, physically they are, but...
I don't know if it's a generational thing,

521
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:06,196
but they see me as their father,
not as a person.

522
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,616
I've always been the one
worrying about them.

523
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,627
And they've never worried about me,
not at all.

524
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,000
It's a really lonely feeling.

525
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:22,886
And I don't want you to...

526
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,215
have to experience that.

527
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,944
Hello?

528
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,536
Open the door.

529
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,334
- Open the fucking door.
- Hey!

530
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,298
Shit!

531
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:44,377
Shit!

532
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:45,803
This is not your door.

533
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,366
What are you doing?

534
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,308
Fucking bitch!

535
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,611
I'm so happy you could come.

536
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,236
Thanks for bringing me.

537
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,786
- Happy birthday, sweetheart.
- Thanks.

538
00:38:56,709 --> 00:39:00,077
Ooh! This is gonna be
a wonderful year for you.

539
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,412
Thanks.

540
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,668
- Oh, it's gonna be just great.
- Okay.

541
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,249
I can feel it. I know.

542
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,585
And I can help you with anything you need.

543
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,090
Thanks, Mom.

544
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,172
- This is Arnold.
- Hi, Arnold.

545
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:13,883
- Hi. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

546
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,011
- Hi.
- Hi.

547
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:21,349
- Oh, you look so nice.
- Oh, thank you.

548
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,899
- Mm.
- Hello.

549
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,727
- Hello.
- How are you?

550
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,357
I'm well. How are you?

551
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,530
- Good. This is nice, huh?
- Yes.

552
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,152
My goodness. How long has it been?

553
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:32,451
- Four... I think.
- Four years?

554
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,028
- Five, I think.
- Five?

555
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:36,330
- Yes.
- Oh, what? Since you got divorced?

556
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,829
No, actually since the last time
we saw each other.

557
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,659
No, we got divorced 12 years ago.

558
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,039
- Oh.
- Twelve? Really?

559
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,587
Oh, you must be Fiona.

560
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:44,959
- Hi. Hi.
- Yeah.

561
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,777
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, it's so nice to meet you.

562
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,884
Oh, my goodness, you are so pretty.

563
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,614
- Oh...
- You didn't tell me how pretty she is.

564
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,345
- Please.
- No, beautiful.

565
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:53,673
No, she is.

566
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,557
So you haven't introduced us.

567
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,807
Oh, I'm so sorry.
This is my friend, Arnold.

568
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,935
- Um, that's my ex-husband.
- Okay.

569
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,607
- Dustin.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

570
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:06,527
- And his wife, Fiona.
- A pleasure.

571
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,195
Nice to meet you.

572
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:09,675
- Cheers.
- Thanks, everyone.

573
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,406
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

574
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,742
I'm happy. Thanks for being here.

575
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,405
- Mm.
- Ah.

576
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,449
And cheers.

577
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,660
- Cheers.
- To your pregnancy.

578
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:31,677
- Oh, you didn't know?
- No, I didn't.

579
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,514
You're pregnant?

580
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:35,951
- You didn't tell him?
- No.

581
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,388
- I'm sorry. I...
- Oh, really?

582
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,261
That's so nice.

583
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,268
It's still new, you know, so...

584
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,394
Yeah.

585
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:49,479
- Oh, well, you're not showing at all.
- Ten weeks, so...

586
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,050
Do you have a boyfriend?

587
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:53,407
- Yeah.
- That's great.

588
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,405
She's the same age that I was.

589
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:56,531
Aw!

590
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,988
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

591
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,811
Would you like some nuts, Arnold?

592
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:08,668
Yeah, sure.

593
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:10,920
Thanks.

594
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:16,596
Would you like an olive?

595
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,017
Sure.

596
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,186
- Thanks.
- Olive?

597
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:24,231
Thanks.

598
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,023
You know, the baby's the same size
as an olive right now.

599
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,476
- Oh.
- It is.

600
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,527
Oh!

601
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,027
What a nice home you two have.

602
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:37,781
It's just... This is beautiful. I love...

603
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,203
Most of this is Rachel's taste, but...

604
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,326
Oh. Where is she?

605
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:43,783
I have no idea.

606
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:46,710
Well, I like it too. Congratulations.

607
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:49,459
Thanks. I'll be moving out soon.

608
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:56,050
So you guys got any plans for Christmas?
Do you celebrate that?

609
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:58,381
Oh, my gosh,
I haven't even thought about that.

610
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,175
We're spending it together.

611
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,011
- Oh. Mmm-hmm.
- Of course. Yeah.

612
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,541
Arnold, my mom tells me that you have

613
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:08,023
some kind of, um,
amusement-park type thing.

614
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:12,103
- Uh, yes. Vertigo park.
- It's so much fun.

615
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,076
- Have you ever done paintball?
- No, I haven't.

616
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:15,364
Is it real paint?

617
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,443
Yes, it's real paint
and it's in two teams.

618
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,529
So it's kind of like a...
I guess it's like a pretend war.

619
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,743
- She loved it.
- I did. I loved it!

620
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,244
You did paintball?

621
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,134
Well, I just did the target shooting.

622
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,749
She has great aim.

623
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,001
Yeah, she sure does, yes, sir.

624
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,124
What did you do before?

625
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,834
I... I was a marine.

626
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:40,172
After that,
I started transporting equipment for them.

627
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,307
Were you an officer?

628
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,221
Yes. Of course.

629
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,558
So you were in the military.

630
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,139
Yeah. I went in to, uh, pay for school.

631
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,609
- Do you have any children?
- Two daughters.

632
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,938
- How old are they?
- 27 and 31.

633
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,318
Oh. So like us, more or less.

634
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,469
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah.

635
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:02,828
Well, they're pretty different
from you guys.

636
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,916
- Are you a grandfather?
- No, no.

637
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,459
And they aren't married?

638
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,379
No, they're single.

639
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:14,081
Very single.

640
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,382
What do they do?

641
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,919
You mean at this particular moment?

642
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,343
Nothing. They're doing nothing.

643
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,676
No, but one of them
just had a meeting with a friend

644
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,664
who owns a pet store
and that went very well, didn't it?

645
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,145
Yeah, it did. Yeah.

646
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:32,687
And it has the potential
to be very lucrative.

647
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,109
People love their pets.

648
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,111
What part of town are they in?

649
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,405
Redondo. With their mom.

650
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:41,450
Uh, you know, high rents,
and all that stuff.

651
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,118
And what does Mom do?

652
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:47,118
She's a...

653
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,166
That's amazing.

654
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:57,125
- Do you want some weed?
- Oh. No. Thank you.

655
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:58,925
No? You don't smoke?

656
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:02,470
Well, no. I mean, I...
I tried it long time ago, but now I...

657
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,299
I'm afraid I'd lose control.

658
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:07,555
No, don't be silly.

659
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:09,974
- Are you sure?
- No.

660
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:14,559
Well, everybody reacts differently,
so if you don't mind, I'll just...

661
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,107
Who's my grandson's father?

662
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:40,398
His name's Theo.

663
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,067
Theo?

664
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:46,116
- Theo what?
- Van Gogh.

665
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:50,738
It doesn't matter. He's Swedish.

666
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:52,990
- Swedish?
- Mmm-hmm.

667
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:55,622
- But does he live here?
- No, he lives in Sweden.

668
00:45:57,046 --> 00:46:00,539
- But he's coming to live here.
- No, he's staying there.

669
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:03,209
- How come?
- I'm moving there.

670
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,587
- She's leaving.
- To go to Sweden?

671
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:08,138
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

672
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:10,591
Wouldn't you?
I'd love to move to fucking Sweden.

673
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,224
- When?
- On the 28th.

674
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,681
- It's so soon.
- Yes.

675
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:19,437
Wha...

676
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:23,987
You know what, honey? Why don't you read
your dad the letter that he wrote you?

677
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,467
- E-mail, Mom.
- Okay, the e-mail.

678
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,027
Read him the e-mail so he can see.

679
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,220
- No.
- He's a wonderful guy.

680
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:29,826
He's just... Oh, he's so lovely

681
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,912
and I think we're both
a bit in love with Theo too.

682
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:33,284
No. Mom...

683
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,616
- Why, Annie? Come on.
- Just cut it out.

684
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,542
It'll be nice for your dad.

685
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:52,804
"The only thing I want is
to have a life with you.

686
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:57,934
I discovered that the love in my heart
was being saved for you.

687
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:06,606
Living the mystery of every day with you
is the most profound thing I can imagine.

688
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,818
I may have been on the biggest waves
in the world,

689
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,573
in the deepest waters,

690
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,656
but the deepest thing I can think of
is to be with you."

691
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:22,962
Oh, my.
Everything is making me cry these days.

692
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:24,711
I don't know why.

693
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,135
- Mm!
- Look at these two.

694
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:32,555
Look at these two little cuties
eating their apples.

695
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:35,099
- Oh, they're so cute!
- You loved apples.

696
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:36,893
The people thought they were twins.

697
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,457
- They looked like twins.
- I know.

698
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:41,349
Our wedding picture.
Here we are, stiff as boards.

699
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:43,855
- We were so naive.
- Oh, we were so in love.

700
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,687
- We were very naive.
- We were in love.

701
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,675
- Hold it up, hold it up.
- No, Peter.

702
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,112
No, for one second.
Let's do a quick then-and-now.

703
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,763
- What's happening?
- Peter, we were in love.

704
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:54,449
I know you were in love.

705
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,121
Just hurry up. Hurry up, okay?

706
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,040
- Don't cut my head off.
- No, no.

707
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,662
She's laughing.

708
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:03,120
- We were laughing.
- No, stop.

709
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:04,830
You look so much happier now.

710
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:07,712
- Send me a copy. Peter.
- I'll send it.

711
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:08,918
Please, send me a...

712
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,718
Oh.

713
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,305
- Look.
- Oh, yeah, okay.

714
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:14,882
We look great. Yeah.

715
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,592
Oh, look at Petey with his necklace.

716
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,678
Look at your necklace. Look at that.

717
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,104
I bought it on the beach.

718
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:22,834
- Really?
- He loved his jewelry. Right?

719
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,269
- Aw!
- Isn't he sweet?

720
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,879
- Oh, look at you!
- Oh!

721
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,839
I know. And here's Annie.

722
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:30,321
This is the day
that she graduated from preschool.

723
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,821
I know because I remember that dress.

724
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,118
- Look at you in that dress.
- I remember that dress.

725
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:36,365
It's so cute.

726
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:40,449
Oh, this... Oh, my God.
Here's our wedding cake.

727
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:42,187
We couldn't get married
with just any cake.

728
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,702
It had to be bigger than we were.

729
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,037
Take a look at that.

730
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:46,838
Oh, but look at that frilly dress!

731
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,665
It was 1986.

732
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,612
- Okay, that's hilarious.
- That's what we wore then.

733
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:53,800
- I was not here.
- No. You were gone by then.

734
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,380
No. I wasn't.

735
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,474
Wow.

736
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,642
I should've been here. Here.

737
00:48:58,727 --> 00:48:59,913
And I wasn't!

738
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,929
All right.

739
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:04,935
I wasn't here.

740
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:10,983
All right, let's calm down.

741
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,073
Dad, you want some water?

742
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:19,829
Arnold?

743
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,202
Arnold? Are you in there?

744
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:38,585
- Maybe he went down to his car.
- No, Mom.

745
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,509
- He's not here.
- He's not.

746
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:44,267
Oh, no, now we woke up the baby.

747
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,518
Jeez. Do you think he got sick?

748
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:50,148
Uh, I don't know. Maybe the food
that he ate didn't agree with him.

749
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:52,195
He did seem a bit off.

750
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:53,863
Hmm. Oh.

751
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,110
He's not downstairs.

752
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:56,678
I'm gonna get the...
I'm gonna get the baby.

753
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,443
No, no, no. I'll do that, just...

754
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,324
Okay. You got him.

755
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:02,956
I'm gonna give him a call.

756
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:05,079
I'll see if I can get him on the phone.

757
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:07,995
All right.

758
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,045
Is there another way to get out?

759
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,172
No, it's just the entrance
and the back door.

760
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,945
- It was just a photo.
- I know.

761
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,649
- It was ages ago.
- Yeah.

762
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,215
Did you say something, Dad?

763
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:19,548
Nothing. You were here.

764
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:24,227
Arnold. It's Gloria. What happened?

765
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:26,314
Um...

766
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:29,224
I'm still at Peter's and I'm worried,

767
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:32,482
so give me call
and let me know where you are, okay?

768
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:34,489
Okay, bye.

769
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:41,578
Sometimes he feels sick.

770
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:46,955
He had surgery recently,
and he has a hard time digesting things.

771
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,332
He had a lot of olives.

772
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:55,459
So, I think that I...

773
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:58,337
I probably...

774
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:02,132
- Thank you. Uh...
- I don't...

775
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:05,264
- I'm sure he'll reappear.
- Yeah.

776
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,938
- Well, thank you for coming.
- Thank you so much.

777
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:11,767
Okay. Mmm-hmm.

778
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,442
- All right.
- I'm driving.

779
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,252
No answer.

780
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:43,298
Okay. I should go.

781
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:46,093
Who is this guy, Mom?

782
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:56,361
Who are you with?

783
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,964
Arnold? I'm busy.

784
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,375
I'm working.

785
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:20,979
What are you doing here?

786
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:22,280
Can we talk?

787
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:26,776
- I don't have anything to say to you.
- I really need you to listen to me.

788
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,611
I do.

789
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,368
How could you be so rude, Arnold?

790
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,618
For what?

791
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:33,951
I was introducing you to my family.

792
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,252
I brought you to my son's birthday party,

793
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,983
- and you have the nerve to disappear?
- You would've done the same thing.

794
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,919
- It wasn't an easy situation.
- Really?

795
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:44,298
I searched for your eyes again and again.

796
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,964
I didn't exist. "We were in love."

797
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,674
- Oh, please.
- "We were in love."

798
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:52,080
- He didn't mean... He was drunk.
- How many times did he have to say that?

799
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:53,595
- He was... He...
- It made me sick!

800
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:56,107
I threw up.

801
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,854
I don't know how you could
do something like that to me.

802
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,690
And the girls called, so...

803
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,445
Grow a pair.

804
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:15,041
Take your... Take your toy guns with you.

805
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:16,753
Gloria.

806
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:20,668
- No. No, Gloria.
- Okay, fine. Okay, fine.

807
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:22,791
Then I'll keep them.

808
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:24,487
- Gloria, don't go.
- I don't want to run you over.

809
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,548
- Gloria.
- Arnold, please!

810
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,717
- Just get... get away!
- I love you, Gloria.

811
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:30,452
I love you, you understand?

812
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:31,796
- Get away from the car.
- Please!

813
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,477
Gloria! Gloria!

814
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,986
Those are your toes?

815
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,112
How many toes?

816
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:52,822
One, two, three, four, five. Five.

817
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:54,788
Five.

818
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:59,244
One, two, three, four, five.

819
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:06,426
One. Two.

Don't squint in this eye.

838
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,283
- That's great.
- So how are your kids?

839
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,459
They must be like four and six now, right?

840
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:04,911
Hold on. Don't talk.

841
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:08,127
When you talk, your eye moves
and I can't see.

842
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,259
What?

843
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:14,428
- Am I going blind?
- No. Not necessarily.

844
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:18,766
But in time, if you don't take care of it,
your field of vision will get smaller,

845
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:20,722
which will limit your day-to-day life.

846
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,016
Like driving, getting around...

847
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:27,566
So I'm afraid I'm going to have
to prescribe you these eye drops.

848
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:30,896
They're to be taken
in each eye twice a day. Okay?

849
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,647
For how long?

850
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:35,700
Unfortunately, for the rest of your life.

851
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,602
Please call me if you wanna talk.

852
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:16,740
Mmm-hmm.

853
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,792
Thank you for everything, Gloria.

854
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:31,544
Or e-mail me, text me. Any time.

855
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:33,758
I will.

856
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,605
Gloria.

857
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:52,310
- These came for you.
- Thank you.

858
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:10,207
If you cut your hair
or do something different to it,

859
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,483
then people think it's the hair
that's different.

860
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:13,964
That's why you look different.

861
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:16,509
- Mmm-hmm.
- They don't notice the other stuff.

862
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,053
Here comes the bride.

863
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:23,011
- You look gorgeous.
- Wow.

864
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,558
- Really?
- Yeah.

865
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:25,760
Really? Is it not too much?

866
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:28,221
No, no, no. It's special enough
for the big day.

867
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,227
- But you still look like yourself.
- Yeah.

868
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:33,977
All right. My hair is next,
so I'll be back.

869
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:36,563
- Okay.
- It's gonna be a great wedding.

870
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:40,692
She's such a beautiful girl.

871
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,875
He calls me every five minutes.

872
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:51,545
Don't pick it up.

873
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,000
No, I won't.

874
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:04,716
Hello.

875
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:06,176
Nope, it's Vicky.

876
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:10,763
Uh, she is in the bathroom.

877
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:14,434
And, uh, it's gonna take a long time.

878
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:16,821
Mmm-hmm.

879
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:19,151
Yeah.

880
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:21,367
Okay.

881
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,491
Bye-bye.

882
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:29,125
I can't believe you did that.

883
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:41,131
- I'm gonna jump out and see you off.
- No, Mom.

884
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:43,463
To help you with your luggage, Annie.
It's heavy.

885
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:45,469
No, Mom. Just leave me here, please.

886
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:48,513
I'm not gonna cry.

887
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:51,562
- I'm just gonna walk you to the entrance.
- Mom.

888
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,645
Just be careful, okay?

889
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:02,857
Yes.

890
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:04,271
And e-mail me when you get there,

891
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,972
just, you know,
to let me know that you're safe.

892
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,783
Just "I'm here" is all I need.

893
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,410
Yes, Mom.

894
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,621
It's fine.

895
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,459
- Take care of my books for me.
- I will.

896
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:24,383
- Don't sell them.
- I won't.

897
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,010
I love you very much.

898
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,277
Okay, baby, okay.

899
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:45,987
All right.

900
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,695
Okay.

901
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:50,996
Okay. Okay.

902
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:17,265
Come on, come on.

903
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:43,165
- Please step back, ma'am.
- Oh, sorry.

904
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:07,902
Bitch!

905
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,488
That's what you are.

906
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:14,079
Bitch!

907
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:15,451
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

908
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:16,874
Fucking dumb bitch!

909
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:19,752
That's what you are!

910
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:22,872
What's it all for, huh?

911
01:03:25,093 --> 01:03:27,176
What's it all for? Nothing!

912
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:33,720
You gave me nothing!
I gave you everything!

913
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:40,432
You didn't fucking love me, did you?

914
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:44,109
You've just fucked me around!

915
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:06,999
Your coffee, ma'am.

916
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:37,677
Arnold?

917
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:49,067
- Okay, thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

918
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,290
Thank you.

919
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:06,539
Thank you so much.

920
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:09,038
- Enjoy Vegas, sir.
- Thanks.

921
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:10,168
It's beautiful.

922
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:25,815
Good afternoon.
Welcome to Caesars Palace.

923
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:28,892
Hello. I have a reservation.

924
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,523
- Under what name?
- Arnold Tenner.

925
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:33,988
Welcome, Mr. Tenner. One moment, please.

926
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:34,127
Honey.

927
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:35,965
Hello?

928
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:40,254
What's happened now?

929
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:45,888
Well... I'm out of town. Why?

930
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:50,560
What?

931
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:54,105
But how?

932
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:00,441
How did she go through a window?

933
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:03,203
What the...?

934
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:10,334
Are the... Are the cuts deep?

935
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:12,296
Are they deep?

936
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:15,915
I'm really sorry.

937
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:22,463
I can't come now. I'm busy.

938
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:26,516
The doctors can take care of it.

939
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:28,811
That's what they do.

940
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:30,762
Yes. The doctors.

941
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,984
I have things to do! Please!

942
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:53,790
What happened?

943
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,424
My ex-wife's had an accident.

944
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:02,962
My daughters called me and...

945
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:11,145
Suzanne walked
right through a glass sliding door.

946
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:16,859
It was too clean. She didn't see it.

947
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:20,024
She crashed through it.

948
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:25,196
Cut herself, uh, badly.

949
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:27,153
On her legs.

950
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:30,990
So stupid. I just, uh, well...

951
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:36,457
I am...

952
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:40,340
I'm not leaving.

953
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:44,591
I'm staying with you.

954
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:51,351
I'm not gonna let them
take this away from me.

955
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:55,355
They're not gonna destroy my life.

956
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,518
I'm staying here with you.

957
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:04,982
It's what I want.

958
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:09,240
With you.

959
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:15,868
Maybe we should just go back.

960
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:27,550
Gloria.

961
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:29,886
Gloria.

962
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:32,767
Gloria, don't go.

963
01:12:55,663 --> 01:12:57,120
You're doing the right thing.

964
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:59,156
It's gonna be fine.

965
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,742
Thank you for saying that.

966
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:08,048
You just may not see
how difficult this is for me.

967
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:12,044
How can I not see you?

968
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,262
I'm looking straight at you.

969
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:21,720
You know, it's not just bad for them

970
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,306
to depend on you so much.
It's bad for you too.

971
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,817
You have the right to your own life.

972
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:31,738
Yes. I do.

973
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:51,633
Do you wanna take a trip?

974
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,878
A big trip? Just the two of us.

975
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:59,300
We could...
We could go to Europe or Spain.

976
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:01,931
- Spain?
- Have you ever been to Spain?

977
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:04,729
- No.
- Well, then let's go.

978
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:06,807
Let's... Let's go to Spain.

979
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:10,269
Let's take ten days off work
and go dancing.

980
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:12,650
We both love to dance. Let's do it.

981
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:14,360
You know, we could die tomorrow.

982
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,951
Turn it off, okay?

983
01:14:38,766 --> 01:14:40,928
All right. My goodness.

984
01:14:58,828 --> 01:14:59,864
All right.

985
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:37,197
Cheers.

986
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:39,195
To Spain.

987
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:41,161
To Spain.

988
01:15:57,762 --> 01:15:59,549
I'll be right back. Excuse me.

989
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:17,474
<i>The winning number is... one!</i>

990
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:28,030
Excuse me.

991
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:30,570
Could I have another one, please?

992
01:18:30,664 --> 01:18:31,996
Absolutely.

993
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:54,803
It's weird to bet it all on 11
when my favorite number is 22.

994
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:58,606
- Well, that's my birthday.
- Then we'll bet them all.

995
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:01,185
What's your name?

996
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:03,691
- Gloria.
- I'm Jen. Nice to meet you.

997
01:19:03,781 --> 01:19:06,569
- Very nice to meet you.
- Yeah. Let's see how we do.

998
01:19:07,117 --> 01:19:08,397
No more bets, please.

999
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:18,038
Black 22.

1000
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:20,370
Oh, my God, we won. You won!

1001
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:23,628
Oh, what a job! Congratulations!

1002
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:25,333
- Good for you!
- Thanks!

1003
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:27,419
Oh. This is Gloria, my new friend.

1004
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:28,949
- Hi. Mark. How you doing?
- How are you?

1005
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:30,760
- Good.
- Oh, our friend, Jeremy.

1006
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:33,182
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1007
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,856
Let's keep it going.

1008
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:42,413
12? All right.
I'll go with that too.

1009
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:02,504
Oh, no, no, no! No, no, no.

1010
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:04,501
No, no. Please. Please.

1011
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:07,004
No, you have no idea. Don't do that.

1012
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:09,419
Don't do it. Don't do it. No.

1013
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:13,007
God, no. I mean it. Really.

1014
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:15,843
Take that off. Please take that off.

1015
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:09,146
Four, still here.

1016
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:12,190
Five, there you go.

1017
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:14,492
Six. Whoa!

1018
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:15,944
Oh.

1019
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:26,375
Excuse me.

1020
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:29,494
May I use your phone to call LA?

1021
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:31,750
Oh, yes. Of course. Uh, number?

1022
01:23:32,382 --> 01:23:37,468
- 818-614...
- 614...

1023
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:40,217
- ...5329.
- ...29.

1024
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:42,806
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1025
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:09,250
Gloria.

1026
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:20,845
- I got your stuff.
- Thanks, Mom.

1027
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:25,058
- I'll pay for the tickets.
- I already bought them.

1028
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:29,478
I'm sorry.

1029
01:24:55,674 --> 01:24:58,257
When did you get a cat?

1030
01:24:59,678 --> 01:25:00,885
Just leave him.

1031
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:17,936
Mom.

1032
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:23,612
Gloria.

1033
01:26:48,328 --> 01:26:49,569
Okay.

1034
01:27:15,105 --> 01:27:17,142
<i>Hello? Gloria?</i>

1035
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:19,273
<i>Are you there?</i>

1036
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:22,105
<i>Say something, please.</i>

1037
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:25,321
<i>You have to believe me. I'm so sorry.</i>

1038
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:28,282
<i>We need to save what we have.</i>

1039
01:30:41,811 --> 01:30:43,177
Gloria.

1040
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:47,849
Gloria!

1041
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:51,648
No. No!

1042
01:30:54,032 --> 01:30:56,115
I love you. No! No!

1043
01:31:00,413 --> 01:31:01,654
You shot me!

1044
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:04,665
Dad?

1045
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:07,164
- What happened?
- Daddy, what happened?

1046
01:31:07,253 --> 01:31:09,290
Oh, my God, help! Help me get him up!

1047
01:31:09,381 --> 01:31:11,261
Who do you think you are,
you fucking old bitch?

1048
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:13,837
- Gloria!
- Come back here and show your face, bitch!

1049
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:18,213
Come on and get your skinny ass back here!

1050
01:31:19,057 --> 01:31:20,639
Gloria!

1051
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:18,238
- Hi.
- Hi.

1052
01:32:33,089 --> 01:32:37,550
- You are a vision.
- Oh, hi! Thank you, Gloria.

1053
01:32:37,635 --> 01:32:39,877
So sorry I didn't make it
to the ceremony.

1054
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:42,338
No, that's okay. It's all right.

1055
01:32:42,432 --> 01:32:44,752
- Congratulations!
- Thank you so much for coming.

1056
01:32:46,352 --> 01:32:47,888
- Hi.
- Hi.

1057
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:50,141
- Got her married.
- Oh, good for you.

1058
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:53,774
- Hi, Gloria.
- I'm sorry.

1059
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:56,648
Oh, please don't worry about that.
I'm just so happy that you're here.

1060
01:32:56,738 --> 01:32:57,696
Me too.

1061
01:32:57,697 --> 01:32:59,154
Oh, nice.

1062
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,106
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1063
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:03,193
You seem a bit off.

1064
01:33:03,286 --> 01:33:05,494
