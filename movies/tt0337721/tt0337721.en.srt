2
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,629
And he asked: "What's the ceiling?"

3
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:18,006
He looks up and he says:
"I don't know, I think it's Beaver Board. "

4
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,346
Set 'em up, Jimmy.
Except for this son of a bitch...

5
00:02:25,387 --> 00:02:28,307
... he's working on my plane tomorrow.
No, just one more, one more come on.

6
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,643
Hey you guys! Here they are.

7
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,853
Here, I'll get it for you.

8
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:38,023
No...
Get out of there, boy...

9
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:40,067
Estelle!
Boys, boys! Come on!

10
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:44,570
Charlie, we all pitched in and
we bought you a girl for your birthday.

11
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:45,696
Oh, yeah?

12
00:02:45,696 --> 00:02:48,782
OK everybody, look here.
One, two, three.

13
00:02:56,789 --> 00:02:58,791
Charlie... two, three.

14
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:06,171
I set it up for you all myself...

15
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,006
Beautiful!

16
00:03:08,548 --> 00:03:10,592
Concentrate.

17
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:14,678
Hey brother!

18
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,388
Five dollars?

19
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:20,308
Piss off, you drunken rummy!
Get outta here!

20
00:03:23,852 --> 00:03:25,395
Come here, come here.

21
00:03:25,437 --> 00:03:26,938
Come here.
Look at me.

22
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,314
Come on, look at me!

23
00:03:28,314 --> 00:03:30,191
Hell, hold this.

24
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:33,486
I'll give you a nice shiney new quarter
if you look at me, huh?!

25
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,155
Look me in the eye.
Look me in the eye.

26
00:03:37,405 --> 00:03:38,823
Look at me!

27
00:03:42,284 --> 00:03:44,870
The oddest bunch of people
I've seen in my life.

28
00:03:44,912 --> 00:03:46,871
Won't even look me in the eye.

29
00:03:47,205 --> 00:03:48,873
Beautiful.

30
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,500
Don't give him a good lead, Charlie.
Concentrate.

31
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,669
Ok, ok, ok, ok.

32
00:03:55,086 --> 00:03:57,630
Hey, brother.
Get off of me.

33
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:01,383
Hey!

34
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,052
I'm sorry, brother.

35
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,264
I ain't your brother.

36
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:10,348
Hey, you're outta here.

37
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:13,351
Get outta here.

38
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:16,020
Come on, take a shot.

39
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,563
Yeah.

40
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:19,648
Rum is here.

41
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:31,783
Wait... stop.

42
00:04:31,825 --> 00:04:34,327
Why?
Wait, I have...

43
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:36,287
...your birthday present.

44
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:37,997
I have your birthday present.

45
00:04:38,372 --> 00:04:39,748
My birthday is not 'til tomorrow.

46
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:45,586
Come on, open it.
I'm opening my present.

47
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,682
Charlie?

48
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:02,641
Charlie, are you in there?

49
00:05:02,683 --> 00:05:05,561
What? Yeah...

50
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:07,812
It's Carl...

51
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:10,648
What... what's going on?

52
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:14,276
Hey, what do you want?

53
00:05:14,318 --> 00:05:16,778
Yeah, it's seven...
Yeah? So?

54
00:05:16,903 --> 00:05:19,780
It's 7:00 and Shep said you're suppose
to be there at 6:30, and it's 7:00 already.

55
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:23,367
Ok, Ok, um.... hold on, I'll be right back.
Give me five minutes.

56
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:24,869
Alright.

57
00:05:25,036 --> 00:05:27,245
Well, we tried calling, but...

58
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:31,166
Oh. Sorry.

59
00:05:39,463 --> 00:05:41,924
Aren't you gonna eat?

60
00:05:43,383 --> 00:05:45,844
What about your present?
What?

61
00:05:46,094 --> 00:05:48,013
Your present?

62
00:05:49,054 --> 00:05:51,348
Yeah, right.
I'll tell you what...

63
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,851
as soon as I get back,
I'll open it, ok? Promise.

64
00:05:56,477 --> 00:05:59,230
All right? I'm gonna call you.
I'll be back before you know it.

65
00:05:59,981 --> 00:06:03,066
So you just help yourself
to anything you need in the 'fridge.

66
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:04,776
And ah...

67
00:06:05,318 --> 00:06:06,610
...see ya.

68
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,123
Here you go, fellas.

69
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:24,458
Queen Maud Gulf

70
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:27,587
We'll set up the first camp
right by the ocean.

71
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:29,838
Go that far?
Cover the territories.

72
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,923
Every bloody inch.

73
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:34,592
Morning fellas.

74
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:44,142
Wow! It's a beaut!

75
00:06:44,392 --> 00:06:45,893
What is it?

76
00:06:45,935 --> 00:06:48,520
She's a Norseman.

77
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,980
Right.

78
00:06:51,064 --> 00:06:53,315
You got pontoons on?

79
00:06:53,357 --> 00:06:55,526
Floats.

80
00:06:55,609 --> 00:06:56,944
Right.

81
00:06:56,986 --> 00:06:58,529
Would you excuse us a second?

82
00:06:58,571 --> 00:06:59,863
Charlie.
Yeah.

83
00:06:59,863 --> 00:07:01,531
Knock it off.
What?

84
00:07:01,531 --> 00:07:03,449
You know what.
Now, knock it off.

85
00:07:04,325 --> 00:07:07,911
These guys are a couple of custards.
I'm just tryin' to have fun.

86
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:09,788
Now look, this is a really big contract.
You piss these guys off...

87
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:12,748
they're gonna take their
business someplace else.

88
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:14,709
Oh bullshit!
They ain't goin' anywhere.

89
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,876
Oh yeah? Well, you just
make sure that they don't.

90
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,797
Speaking of which...

91
00:07:22,465 --> 00:07:24,967
how 'bout a little detour
after my run?

92
00:07:25,217 --> 00:07:27,386
Where?
Bathurst.

93
00:07:28,386 --> 00:07:30,346
Why?
Business.

94
00:07:30,805 --> 00:07:32,515
What kind of business?

95
00:07:32,515 --> 00:07:34,224
Oh, a little business business.

96
00:07:38,603 --> 00:07:41,146
Come on, two or three days.
I'm in, I'm out.

97
00:07:42,273 --> 00:07:44,149
Make it worth your while.

98
00:07:45,442 --> 00:07:46,609
Two.
Three.

99
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:47,694
Two!

100
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:49,570
And you let me know where you are.

101
00:07:51,155 --> 00:07:52,239
Alright.

102
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:54,700
And try to keep those
guys happy, will ya?

103
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:57,910
Hey. Get your suit all dirty?

104
00:07:58,828 --> 00:08:01,664
It's kind of grimy up here.
Oh yeah. Thanks.

105
00:08:01,997 --> 00:08:03,457
So uh...

106
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:05,416
...you've been flying long?

107
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,418
Guess a better part
of twelve years.

108
00:08:07,502 --> 00:08:09,419
He's my best pilot
during the war.

109
00:08:10,337 --> 00:08:12,339
Africa?

110
00:08:12,631 --> 00:08:14,258
No. Europe.

111
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:16,259
Flew bombers, Mosquitos, mostly.

112
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:18,386
Bombed the hell out of Manheim.

113
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:22,013
Hell, I would've sunk the Bismark
if they'd given me half a chance.

114
00:08:22,597 --> 00:08:24,182
I was infantry myself.

115
00:08:24,224 --> 00:08:25,934
Well, sir...
you have my sympathy.

116
00:08:26,935 --> 00:08:28,686
So, you have a co-pilot
you work with?

117
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:30,062
Sure do.

118
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,814
Like the book says...

119
00:08:31,855 --> 00:08:33,481
God!

120
00:11:15,406 --> 00:11:17,365
Heavy little buggers, huh?

121
00:11:19,034 --> 00:11:21,328
Didn't expect to see anybody here.

122
00:11:24,997 --> 00:11:27,291
You fellas like chocolate?

123
00:11:31,252 --> 00:11:33,880
You eat this stuff?

124
00:11:36,757 --> 00:11:38,300
Thanks again.

125
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:52,728
Come.

126
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,440
Come.

127
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,317
Why? What d'ya got there?

128
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:01,319
Please... please...
come.

129
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,154
You got some pelts?

130
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:05,989
A little white fox?

131
00:12:07,574 --> 00:12:09,409
What? Wanna do a little trade'n?

132
00:12:11,994 --> 00:12:13,704
Yeah, sure.
What the hell.

133
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:24,588
Ah Jesus.

134
00:12:32,386 --> 00:12:35,889
Is she your girlfriend?

135
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,432
Your sister?

136
00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:41,351
Well, ah... she's sick,
I can't do anything for her...

137
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,271
because she's got TB
or something.

138
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:47,982
You know what tuberculosis is?
You...

139
00:12:48,274 --> 00:12:51,109
No. Not even going straight back.
I can't take her.

140
00:12:51,401 --> 00:12:53,528
Take her back to her village.

141
00:12:53,778 --> 00:12:55,947
You got a medicine man,
or somethin' don't ya?

142
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,907
I mean, the hospitals in
Yellowknife are full.

143
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:02,577
She stays.

144
00:13:05,413 --> 00:13:06,998
I'm sorry.

145
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,430
What d'ya got there?

146
00:13:26,054 --> 00:13:28,181
Holy Smokes!

147
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,393
Lotta money right there.

148
00:13:32,101 --> 00:13:35,187
Yellowknife

149
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:43,444
Alright. Shit.

150
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:46,113
I'm deadhead'n anyway.

151
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,198
But you hurry, alright?
Gotta storm brew'n.

152
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,467
Give me your government
number there...

153
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:15,095
Eskimo tag in case
I gotta get a hold of ya.

154
00:14:17,055 --> 00:14:19,598
E5254

155
00:14:20,224 --> 00:14:21,517
Alright.

156
00:14:21,725 --> 00:14:23,811
This her stuff?

157
00:14:23,978 --> 00:14:25,061
Ok.

158
00:14:26,271 --> 00:14:27,772
Come on.

159
00:14:28,022 --> 00:14:29,607
Ok, here?

160
00:14:34,945 --> 00:14:36,028
Here you go.

161
00:14:38,322 --> 00:14:40,616
Yellowknife.
Yes, yes, Yellowknife.

162
00:14:40,658 --> 00:14:42,909
I said I'd take her to Yellowknife.

163
00:14:42,951 --> 00:14:46,538
Come visit her in the spring,
bring her a potted plant.

164
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:39,581
How you doing over there?
You alright?

165
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:45,628
Good days and bad days
I guess, huh?

166
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,467
Coffee?

167
00:15:58,346 --> 00:16:00,390
No. I believe not.

168
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,564
Chocolate?

169
00:16:12,316 --> 00:16:14,527
Come on. It's Nestles.

170
00:16:15,236 --> 00:16:17,153
You know...
N-E-S-T-L-E-S

171
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:19,781
Nestles makes the very best.

172
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:25,077
Alright. Never mind.

173
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:30,331
No what?
To hell with it.

174
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,751
What d'ya say we screw Bathhurst...
head straight for home?

175
00:16:35,293 --> 00:16:37,671
Get around this miserable weather.

176
00:16:39,588 --> 00:16:44,385
Funny thing is I was just going there
to sell off those grape di soda...

177
00:16:44,635 --> 00:16:47,136
maybe scrounge up some ivory.
...glad I got that covered.

178
00:16:49,138 --> 00:16:51,056
Life is funny that way.

179
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,053
Shit!

180
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,312
May Day, May Day, May Day!
This is Juliet-India-November...

181
00:17:48,354 --> 00:17:52,899
I'm outta fuel.
We're going down.

182
00:17:56,652 --> 00:17:58,070
Come on!

183
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,077
Hang on!

184
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:23,549
Come on!

185
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,013
Come on!

186
00:18:39,062 --> 00:18:41,397
Son of a bitch!
Come on!

187
00:18:42,481 --> 00:18:43,857
Pull up!

188
00:18:45,942 --> 00:18:47,027
Come on! Come on!

189
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:53,907
Pull up!

190
00:18:57,827 --> 00:18:59,620
Don't stop, you bitch!

191
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,623
Shit!

192
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:48,869
Shit!

193
00:19:51,621 --> 00:19:53,873
Son of a bitch!

194
00:20:08,844 --> 00:20:10,094
Shit!

195
00:20:13,931 --> 00:20:15,932
Son of a bitch!

196
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:42,496
Well, you might as well get out.

197
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:44,707
She's broken!

198
00:20:45,498 --> 00:20:47,750
She's smashed to hell,
you understand?

199
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:51,587
Don't fly no more.

200
00:22:21,494 --> 00:22:23,204
Fish'n.

201
00:22:24,913 --> 00:22:27,624
What the hell kind of fish
can you catch in here?

202
00:22:35,881 --> 00:22:38,007
It's Juliet-India-November...

203
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:40,176
Anyone read?
Anyone read?

204
00:22:41,177 --> 00:22:42,678
Warren, do you copy?

205
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,347
Bathhurst, Baker Lake.
Anyone?

206
00:22:47,224 --> 00:22:48,766
Oh, hey hey, easy
easy with that.

207
00:22:49,058 --> 00:22:52,144
No, no.
Get outta here with that.

208
00:22:56,189 --> 00:22:57,899
Oh....no what?

209
00:22:58,358 --> 00:22:59,984
Just go....go

210
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:02,277
You eat it if you're gonna
eat it like that. Go.

211
00:23:07,782 --> 00:23:09,200
Disgusting.

212
00:24:42,735 --> 00:24:44,528
You speak any English?

213
00:24:49,449 --> 00:24:51,283
You speak any English?

214
00:24:52,493 --> 00:24:54,119
Yes, no...

215
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:55,746
Little bit?

216
00:24:58,289 --> 00:24:59,457
No?

217
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,838
I don't know if you
understand our situation here,

218
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,672
but we're in a hell of a bind.

219
00:25:08,672 --> 00:25:10,841
Nobody knows where
the hell we are.

220
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,345
The reason being is I didn't
stick to my flight plan.

221
00:25:19,098 --> 00:25:20,682
The radio's busted.

222
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:23,560
I can't call out.

223
00:25:26,021 --> 00:25:27,980
Try and fix it in the
morning, but...

224
00:25:28,981 --> 00:25:31,817
I think my tools are in the
bottom of that lake somewhere.

225
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:37,238
So I'm just saying, uh...

226
00:25:37,572 --> 00:25:40,657
...there's a good chance
nobody's gonna show up.

227
00:25:44,494 --> 00:25:45,995
Ok?

228
00:25:50,624 --> 00:25:52,292
Good talk'n to ya.

229
00:25:58,172 --> 00:25:59,465
Hey, Shep...

230
00:25:59,715 --> 00:26:01,925
Still no sign of 'em.
I'm start'n to think...

231
00:26:01,966 --> 00:26:04,093
No sign of who?
Charlie?

232
00:26:04,135 --> 00:26:07,763
Yeah, he just got a little delayed
by the weather, that's all.

233
00:26:10,474 --> 00:26:13,642
Now why would you say something
like that in front of her for, huh?

234
00:26:13,684 --> 00:26:15,978
I didn't know she was standing there.
Jesus, Carl.

235
00:26:16,145 --> 00:26:19,147
You know Charlie's got women
stashed all over the bloody map.

236
00:26:19,189 --> 00:26:20,940
I know, but shouldn't we have
heard something by now?

237
00:26:20,982 --> 00:26:23,359
Hey, don't worry about it.
He's fine.

238
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,194
I'll start worrying
about Charlie Holladay

239
00:26:25,194 --> 00:26:27,404
five minutes after
hell freezes over.

240
00:26:28,906 --> 00:26:30,491
I'll tell ya what though...

241
00:26:30,532 --> 00:26:33,117
he'd better be having
one hell of a good time.

242
00:27:27,954 --> 00:27:29,788
Shit! No!

243
00:27:30,205 --> 00:27:31,582
No!

244
00:27:31,915 --> 00:27:33,959
No!

245
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:35,668
No!

246
00:28:15,452 --> 00:28:16,702
Hey!

247
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:20,789
A town couple hundred
miles east of here.

248
00:28:21,748 --> 00:28:24,041
I'm gonna head for it.

249
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:25,668
Alright?

250
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,295
I left you some grub.

251
00:28:28,336 --> 00:28:30,338
Be back in about a week.

252
00:28:37,136 --> 00:28:38,387
What?

253
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,849
No. It's too far.
You stay.

254
00:28:43,141 --> 00:28:44,517
Ok? You stay here.

255
00:28:45,101 --> 00:28:47,686
I'll send a plane
to get you.

256
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:50,772
Ok? I'll be back in a little bit.

257
00:31:40,745 --> 00:31:42,287
Shit!

258
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,909
Shit!

259
00:33:32,753 --> 00:33:34,379
Charlie Holladay...

260
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:37,215
with the Norseman.
Juliet-India-November

261
00:33:37,466 --> 00:33:39,425
I think I got it here.

262
00:33:40,343 --> 00:33:42,094
Norseman!
Mark 5!

263
00:33:42,845 --> 00:33:45,263
They say it isn't gonna break
for at least another 24.

264
00:33:47,432 --> 00:33:48,600
Second it does...

265
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,185
Pierce, I want you and
Carl to go to the Gulf.

266
00:33:51,268 --> 00:33:53,479
You take the Stinson,
cover west towards Bathurst.

267
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:54,521
Yes, sir.

268
00:33:54,897 --> 00:33:55,980
Bathurst?

269
00:33:59,567 --> 00:34:00,610
Can you try them? Over.

270
00:34:00,902 --> 00:34:02,444
Sorry.

271
00:34:02,694 --> 00:34:04,196
Frank. It's the station.

272
00:34:04,613 --> 00:34:07,324
The want to make it an
official missing person.

273
00:34:11,744 --> 00:34:13,162
Yeah, Ok.

274
00:34:46,397 --> 00:34:47,773
Charlie!

275
00:34:47,815 --> 00:34:49,482
Charlie!
What?

276
00:34:49,524 --> 00:34:53,278
Hold back on the formation.

277
00:34:55,279 --> 00:34:56,405
No!

278
00:34:58,824 --> 00:35:00,242
Charlie!

279
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,785
No!

280
00:40:03,783 --> 00:40:05,867
Shit!

281
00:40:18,711 --> 00:40:20,421
What the hell?

282
00:40:24,925 --> 00:40:26,676
What the hell you doing here?

283
00:40:31,347 --> 00:40:32,556
Hey.

284
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,599
Did you follow me?

285
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,935
You follow me?

286
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:41,104
Walk?
Did you walk here?

287
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,814
Sleep.

288
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,484
You speak English?

289
00:40:49,153 --> 00:40:50,863
Little bit.

290
00:41:00,913 --> 00:41:02,247
Eat.

291
00:41:02,497 --> 00:41:03,623
Thank you.

292
00:41:11,129 --> 00:41:12,172
Oh, that's good.

293
00:41:13,173 --> 00:41:14,507
That's good.

294
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:53,164
Where did you get this?

295
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:58,043
What is this?
Sicsic.

296
00:42:03,797 --> 00:42:05,090
What's sicsic?

297
00:42:22,396 --> 00:42:24,273
You catch this?

298
00:42:27,108 --> 00:42:29,152
Where the hell you find this?

299
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:41,454
I don't even know your name.

300
00:42:42,747 --> 00:42:44,038
What's your name?

301
00:42:45,832 --> 00:42:47,125
No, no...

302
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:49,710
Not your tag.

303
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:52,671
Your name.
What do I call you?

304
00:42:55,047 --> 00:42:56,757
Kanalaaq.

305
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:58,509
Kanalaaq.

306
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:02,512
Charlie.

307
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,347
Charlie?

308
00:43:07,224 --> 00:43:09,268
Nice and easy.

309
00:43:16,524 --> 00:43:18,026
Here we go, Cherry.

310
00:43:18,483 --> 00:43:20,485
Look alive.

311
00:43:40,836 --> 00:43:42,795
Fishing camp.

312
00:43:46,007 --> 00:43:47,632
Huskies.

313
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:54,930
What are you doing?

314
00:43:54,972 --> 00:43:56,473
Lunch.

315
00:43:58,892 --> 00:44:01,144
Why? Don't you ever eat, Cherry?

316
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:03,813
Don't call me that.

317
00:44:04,313 --> 00:44:06,189
How long you been up here?

318
00:44:06,982 --> 00:44:08,692
Couple months.

319
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:11,068
It's different, isn't it?

320
00:44:13,696 --> 00:44:15,990
How big you think it is,
the territory?

321
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,074
Half a million?
Million miles?

322
00:44:20,034 --> 00:44:22,744
You know, you could put all of
Europe in here three times...

323
00:44:22,786 --> 00:44:25,414
and still have room for Greenland.

324
00:44:25,414 --> 00:44:27,499
What are you talking about?

325
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,335
Charlie was where he
was suppose to be.

326
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,754
Why is Shep sending
people to Bathhurst?

327
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,384
Maybe the plane's
under the water...

328
00:44:40,592 --> 00:44:42,761
crashed on the sand
or something.

329
00:44:42,803 --> 00:44:44,930
How'd the barrels
get on the beach?

330
00:44:45,806 --> 00:44:47,223
Right.

331
00:44:47,682 --> 00:44:49,642
Somethin' else happened.

332
00:44:49,892 --> 00:44:51,102
You know?

333
00:44:51,853 --> 00:44:54,187
Maybe it was murder.

334
00:44:54,604 --> 00:44:56,439
Maybe the Huskies killed him.

335
00:44:57,524 --> 00:44:59,608
Then they ate him.

336
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:02,236
Then they ate his plane.

337
00:45:08,241 --> 00:45:09,991
What's the matter with you?

338
00:45:11,535 --> 00:45:13,245
Nothing.

339
00:45:16,455 --> 00:45:18,624
Let's go find the poor
son of a bitch.

340
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,835
Here. A little souvenir.

341
00:46:30,725 --> 00:46:32,434
What are these little things?

342
00:46:35,604 --> 00:46:38,105
Old boots.
Old boots.

343
00:46:40,858 --> 00:46:42,568
Want some water?

344
00:46:42,568 --> 00:46:44,569
Here. Do you want some?

345
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:54,119
Water.

346
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:55,620
Hot.

347
00:47:02,042 --> 00:47:03,585
Water?
Drink.

348
00:47:03,627 --> 00:47:05,170
Drinking is "imec"?

349
00:47:06,588 --> 00:47:08,339
Water is "imac"?

350
00:47:08,631 --> 00:47:11,217
Drink... "Imec".

351
00:47:11,467 --> 00:47:12,759
What's that?

352
00:47:18,597 --> 00:47:20,349
Water... "Imac".

353
00:47:22,935 --> 00:47:24,977
I'm not gonna remember all this.

354
00:48:01,716 --> 00:48:02,759
Hey!

355
00:48:03,551 --> 00:48:04,928
What are you doing?

356
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:07,262
What?

357
00:48:07,304 --> 00:48:09,932
Fix it.
No... not right now.

358
00:48:10,557 --> 00:48:11,849
Wait!

359
00:48:12,183 --> 00:48:13,976
I need those.

360
00:48:14,185 --> 00:48:15,895
Come back!

361
00:48:16,187 --> 00:48:17,645
Kanalaaq!

362
00:48:20,148 --> 00:48:21,983
Come back!

363
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,945
What about up here?
North of Slave Lake.

364
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,697
... have already covered that...
I don't give a damn.

365
00:48:29,947 --> 00:48:31,824
I'm telling you where
I want you to go.

366
00:48:32,783 --> 00:48:33,993
Fine.

367
00:48:40,123 --> 00:48:41,332
Pierce?

368
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,125
Do the Back River...

369
00:48:43,292 --> 00:48:45,085
in case he cuts straight down.

370
00:48:45,127 --> 00:48:46,794
Why would he?

371
00:48:48,171 --> 00:48:49,255
Shep?

372
00:49:05,018 --> 00:49:06,519
Hello, Mrs. Holladay.

373
00:49:06,728 --> 00:49:09,314
This is Walter Sheperd.

374
00:49:09,481 --> 00:49:11,190
I work with your son.

375
00:49:11,565 --> 00:49:13,817
I don't know exactly
how to say this.

376
00:49:16,235 --> 00:49:18,863
I always hoped I'd never
have to make this call.

377
00:49:33,249 --> 00:49:35,126
Want some fish?

378
00:49:38,004 --> 00:49:40,005
Your, um...
You got something...

379
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:55,018
What are you making?

380
00:50:01,148 --> 00:50:02,857
For you.

381
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:06,068
No you don't have to do that.

382
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,486
At least...

383
00:50:09,029 --> 00:50:10,572
these boots are still fine.

384
00:50:10,572 --> 00:50:13,825
Put a few stitches in them,
they'll take me a few more miles.

385
00:50:18,078 --> 00:50:19,955
You should rest.
You know?

386
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:16,626
Alright. That's it.
Gotta go back.

387
00:51:17,586 --> 00:51:19,795
Maybe we should push a little bit.
No.

388
00:51:22,715 --> 00:51:25,174
Look at the gauge.
We got the fuel.

389
00:51:25,383 --> 00:51:27,343
Just 5 more minutes.
Look at the gauge.

390
00:51:27,552 --> 00:51:30,512
What do you think this is, a game?
What are you, some kind of boy scout?

391
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,305
What are you talking about, Pierce?

392
00:51:32,723 --> 00:51:35,183
Think I don't know
what's going on here?

393
00:51:35,934 --> 00:51:37,309
You think I don't really
see what's going on?

394
00:51:37,351 --> 00:51:38,978
Why don't you just come out
and say it? Say what?

395
00:51:39,019 --> 00:51:40,771
You don't wanna find him!

396
00:51:48,068 --> 00:51:49,861
You... you dumb ass kid!

397
00:51:50,862 --> 00:51:52,990
Charlie Holladay's dead.

398
00:51:53,906 --> 00:51:56,867
He was an arrogant, selfish
son of a bitch who got sloppy...

399
00:51:56,909 --> 00:51:58,577
and now he's dead.

400
00:52:01,037 --> 00:52:03,707
Take a look out there.
Go on. Just look down below.

401
00:52:04,207 --> 00:52:05,833
You see that?

402
00:52:07,918 --> 00:52:09,837
That's death, boy.

403
00:52:10,087 --> 00:52:13,005
This land will kill you as
sure as a bullet in the head.

404
00:52:13,256 --> 00:52:15,967
We just run this little drill
to make us all feel better.

405
00:52:16,676 --> 00:52:17,884
Because next time, who knows,
could be my ass...

406
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:20,595
or Shephard's, your yours.

407
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:23,597
He would have done the
same for us. What?

408
00:52:23,639 --> 00:52:26,350
He would have done the same for us.
Your goddamn right, he would.

409
00:52:26,892 --> 00:52:28,851
But that don't change the facts.

410
00:52:58,126 --> 00:52:59,836
Hey!

411
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:02,505
Hey!

412
00:53:06,758 --> 00:53:08,635
Hey!

413
00:53:29,693 --> 00:53:32,738
You see, the way I figure it,
I probably walked for 5 days.

414
00:53:33,696 --> 00:53:36,157
Maybe... I don't know...

415
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:38,618
...15, 20 miles a day.

416
00:53:39,326 --> 00:53:41,662
So that would put us,
probably...

417
00:53:42,663 --> 00:53:44,831
...80, 90 miles from the plane.

418
00:53:45,122 --> 00:53:48,542
So if Shep is flying a triangular
grid from Queen Maud Gulf...

419
00:53:48,542 --> 00:53:50,961
...Bathurst, Yellowknife...

420
00:53:51,586 --> 00:53:53,755
and that was them
and they're flying east...

421
00:53:54,339 --> 00:53:57,007
they'd see the plane.
They'd see the S.O.S.

422
00:53:57,341 --> 00:53:59,802
and they'd know
we're alive. But, no...

423
00:53:59,843 --> 00:54:02,304
we're here in the middle
of bloody nowhere.

424
00:54:03,471 --> 00:54:05,598
Because I left the plane.

425
00:54:05,807 --> 00:54:07,809
Shit!

426
00:54:08,267 --> 00:54:12,562
You never, never, never
leave the plane!

427
00:54:14,772 --> 00:54:16,565
But I know it was them.

428
00:54:16,857 --> 00:54:18,734
We gotta go back.

429
00:54:19,068 --> 00:54:22,111
You're gonna cut my
circulation off there.

430
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:29,493
Alright.

431
00:54:31,036 --> 00:54:33,162
I'm not a bloody invalid.
I'm good.

432
00:54:33,329 --> 00:54:35,289
I got it, I got it, I got it.
I'm good.

433
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:39,793
Alright, let's go back to camp.

434
00:54:40,418 --> 00:54:42,420
No, I'm not going in the water.

435
00:54:42,462 --> 00:54:45,756
It's Ok.
No, I'll get soaked.

436
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,716
It's Ok.

437
00:54:57,557 --> 00:54:59,059
How 'bout that?

438
00:55:01,435 --> 00:55:02,937
Water tight.

439
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:07,649
I got boots.

440
00:56:24,128 --> 00:56:25,504
You've... wife?

441
00:56:25,546 --> 00:56:27,089
Me? No.

442
00:56:27,381 --> 00:56:29,382
Not married.

443
00:56:29,758 --> 00:56:31,801
Use to have a girl.

444
00:56:33,178 --> 00:56:35,429
That was a while ago.

445
00:56:37,973 --> 00:56:39,308
How old?

446
00:56:39,558 --> 00:56:41,058
32.

447
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,730
32, no wife?

448
00:56:47,105 --> 00:56:48,940
How old are you?

449
00:56:51,067 --> 00:56:52,818
20?

450
00:56:53,193 --> 00:56:55,321
How 'bout you?
You got a wife?

451
00:57:44,862 --> 00:57:47,488
Hey. That's enough.
Time out.

452
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:52,868
You know, you've been singing the
same song for three days now.

453
00:57:53,452 --> 00:57:55,454
I mean, have mercy woman.

454
00:57:55,495 --> 00:57:57,788
A man can only take
so much of this.

455
00:57:57,997 --> 00:57:59,457
You know any other songs?

456
00:57:59,999 --> 00:58:03,585
You know anything with
a tune or a beat?

457
00:58:04,043 --> 00:58:05,879
You sing.
No, ah...

458
00:58:06,087 --> 00:58:08,006
that's not what I meant.
You sing now.

459
00:58:11,133 --> 00:58:12,426
Alright.

460
00:58:13,594 --> 00:58:15,094
Fine.
I'll sing.

461
00:58:17,847 --> 00:58:20,515
"When the moon hits your eye... "

462
00:58:20,557 --> 00:58:23,184
"... like a big pizza pie... "

463
00:58:23,685 --> 00:58:25,562
"... that's amore."

464
00:58:26,812 --> 00:58:29,606
"When the world seems to shine... "

465
00:58:29,648 --> 00:58:32,442
"... like you've had too much wine... "

466
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:35,027
"... that's amore."

467
00:59:04,593 --> 00:59:05,845
So?

468
00:59:06,095 --> 00:59:07,762
Sit down.

469
00:59:14,601 --> 00:59:16,770
Search and rescue called.

470
00:59:18,564 --> 00:59:21,899
They've been at it for
almost three weeks now.

471
00:59:22,441 --> 00:59:24,360
You know what they
say about them.

472
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:27,237
They have a perfect record...

473
00:59:28,071 --> 00:59:31,240
but never found anybody.

474
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:36,703
The country is just...
so big, you know?

475
00:59:37,161 --> 00:59:39,622
And if, God forbid,
the plane burned...

476
00:59:39,664 --> 00:59:42,041
they could fly right
over the top of it...

477
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:44,918
never see anything at all.

478
00:59:47,671 --> 00:59:49,380
I'm sorry kid.

479
01:00:16,903 --> 01:00:18,237
You Ok?

480
01:00:19,029 --> 01:00:20,739
Here, sit down.

481
01:00:21,782 --> 01:00:23,699
Let's rest a while.

482
01:00:34,334 --> 01:00:36,377
What the hell is that?

483
01:00:36,627 --> 01:00:38,087
It's not the plane.

484
01:00:38,087 --> 01:00:40,130
You see that?

485
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,477
Dear God.

486
01:01:01,689 --> 01:01:04,483
Ooh, jeeze,
look at this.

487
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,300
Bimotor...

488
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:37,928
You know,
I think this is a B-18.

489
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,346
Sure took a tumble.

490
01:01:40,638 --> 01:01:42,890
Look at all this stuff.
Come look at this.

491
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:44,391
Come here.

492
01:01:45,517 --> 01:01:47,477
We can use some of this.

493
01:01:48,937 --> 01:01:50,730
Look up in here.

494
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,773
All kinds of stuff.

495
01:01:52,814 --> 01:01:53,857
Yeah.

496
01:01:54,775 --> 01:01:56,526
Use that.

497
01:01:59,195 --> 01:02:00,947
Look at the jack I found here.

498
01:02:01,197 --> 01:02:03,114
We can kill a few squirrels
with that, huh?

499
01:02:04,741 --> 01:02:06,743
Come on. There's all kinds
of stuff. Give me a hand.

500
01:02:11,622 --> 01:02:13,374
It's Ok.

501
01:02:14,333 --> 01:02:15,792
It's Ok.

502
01:02:16,626 --> 01:02:18,628
Poor son of a bitch.

503
01:02:32,889 --> 01:02:34,557
Look at that!

504
01:02:34,807 --> 01:02:36,309
Not too bad.

505
01:02:37,477 --> 01:02:39,770
Use it for somethin'.

506
01:02:41,396 --> 01:02:44,106
Come on!
Come on, give me a hand.

507
01:02:48,986 --> 01:02:49,986
Yeah!

508
01:02:51,446 --> 01:02:52,906
Jack pot!

509
01:02:53,198 --> 01:02:54,532
Look at this!

510
01:02:55,908 --> 01:02:57,618
Thank you!

511
01:03:00,996 --> 01:03:03,122
That's gonna save us,
right there.

512
01:03:14,173 --> 01:03:17,009
We were meant to
find this stuff, Kanalaaq.

513
01:03:20,887 --> 01:03:22,764
Would you at least
look at me?

514
01:03:25,849 --> 01:03:27,768
I'm talking to you.

515
01:03:29,561 --> 01:03:31,479
Would you look at me?

516
01:05:00,385 --> 01:05:02,596
What are you doing?

517
01:05:07,683 --> 01:05:10,144
He doesn't need
these things, you know.

518
01:05:36,748 --> 01:05:38,417
Fine.

519
01:06:07,274 --> 01:06:10,860
The world has many spirits.

520
01:06:12,194 --> 01:06:15,071
All things ...

521
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:21,743
Breath?

522
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:25,038
Everything breathes?

523
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:27,999
Some spirits good...

524
01:06:33,378 --> 01:06:36,214
some bad.

525
01:06:37,173 --> 01:06:39,216
They trick you.

526
01:06:43,554 --> 01:06:46,931
When you die...

527
01:06:47,557 --> 01:06:50,183
"Tarquiup" will come.

528
01:06:50,517 --> 01:06:52,686
Who's that?
Who is Tarquiup?

529
01:06:52,727 --> 01:06:54,563
Is he a spirit?

530
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:56,814
He...

531
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:02,652
He sees you?

532
01:07:03,736 --> 01:07:05,363
He watches you?

533
01:07:05,655 --> 01:07:08,949
He says...

534
01:07:10,242 --> 01:07:13,120
Come. It's Ok.

535
01:07:13,911 --> 01:07:16,789
It's your time now.
It's Ok.

536
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:21,668
Where does he take you,
when he comes?

537
01:07:26,713 --> 01:07:29,550
Good hunting.

538
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:32,426
Many fields...

539
01:07:33,636 --> 01:07:35,346
fish...

540
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:39,516
walrus?

541
01:07:42,644 --> 01:07:44,770
Sounds like a good place.

542
01:07:47,606 --> 01:07:50,066
When you die...

543
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:57,447
you need...

544
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:05,371
You need your tools.

545
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:11,960
I see.

546
01:08:16,713 --> 01:08:18,923
So, where does Tarquiup live?

547
01:08:25,971 --> 01:08:27,806
The moon?

548
01:08:40,066 --> 01:08:41,150
Hey.

549
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:47,613
I was just trying to figure
out whose dog that is.

550
01:08:48,489 --> 01:08:50,824
You off work?
No, just a break.

551
01:08:51,367 --> 01:08:53,368
Told Jimmy I needed some air.

552
01:08:53,952 --> 01:08:56,204
I wanted to tell you something.

553
01:08:59,081 --> 01:09:01,500
I know you feel bad, Shep.

554
01:09:01,792 --> 01:09:04,294
But this wasn't your fault.

555
01:09:04,835 --> 01:09:08,339
You aren't responsible for him.
Nobody was.

556
01:09:09,298 --> 01:09:12,884
When it comes right down to it,
all of us are just alone in this world...

557
01:09:12,926 --> 01:09:15,970
and that's just the way it is.

558
01:09:19,181 --> 01:09:21,266
I brought you something.

559
01:09:22,767 --> 01:09:24,936
I thought you might
like to have it.

560
01:09:28,855 --> 01:09:30,440
Ok.

561
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:54,627
What are you doing?

562
01:09:55,044 --> 01:09:57,129
Gettin' my stuff.

563
01:10:00,006 --> 01:10:02,258
I heard they called off the search.

564
01:10:03,176 --> 01:10:04,635
Yeah.

565
01:10:04,885 --> 01:10:06,762
That's a tough break.

566
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:13,309
Listen, if you're looking for another flyer,
I got a buddy you might wanna meet.

567
01:10:14,018 --> 01:10:17,020
He and I are partners on
a couple of side deals we got going.

568
01:10:17,896 --> 01:10:20,649
I do a little speculating now
and again myself, you know?

569
01:10:21,148 --> 01:10:23,067
Matter of fact, you know
we should talk.

570
01:10:24,401 --> 01:10:27,028
Because, uh...
maybe we could...

571
01:10:28,571 --> 01:10:30,615
work out a little arrangement?

572
01:10:31,449 --> 01:10:32,991
Get out.

573
01:10:33,575 --> 01:10:35,327
What?
You heard me.

574
01:10:35,577 --> 01:10:37,704
Go on.
Get the hell outta here.

575
01:10:38,454 --> 01:10:41,457
Before I throw you
through the goddamn wall.

576
01:11:21,698 --> 01:11:23,158
Look.

577
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:35,126
Thank God!

578
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:45,384
Look at that.

579
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:47,344
How could you miss her?

580
01:11:54,267 --> 01:11:56,476
Come on. I know you
guys left something here.

581
01:12:08,862 --> 01:12:11,948
Alright. Come on fellas,
I know you left it. So where is it?

582
01:12:12,197 --> 01:12:14,033
Come on, Shep, Pierce.

583
01:12:16,827 --> 01:12:18,661
I don't believe it.

584
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:27,919
Damn it!

585
01:12:39,345 --> 01:12:41,014
Nothin!

586
01:12:41,306 --> 01:12:44,474
Not a note. Not a sign. Nothin!
How could they miss this?

587
01:12:47,893 --> 01:12:49,937
How could they not see us?

588
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,190
You know, the snow is comin'.

589
01:12:54,232 --> 01:12:56,484
What is it gonna get?
20, 40 below?

590
01:12:58,611 --> 01:13:01,238
How we gonna eat then, huh?
How we gonna stay alive?

591
01:13:04,783 --> 01:13:07,160
I don't even know
why you came for me.

592
01:13:13,915 --> 01:13:15,792
But you know what
the real joke is?

593
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:19,336
We never had a chance.

594
01:13:19,587 --> 01:13:21,839
We were dead the minute
we hit the ground.

595
01:14:30,854 --> 01:14:33,855
(Speaking Eskimo)

596
01:14:38,943 --> 01:14:41,195
Leave me alone.

597
01:14:41,696 --> 01:14:44,198
(Speaking Eskimo)

598
01:14:44,365 --> 01:14:46,408
I said leave me alone.

599
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:30,451
Charlie, no!

600
01:16:32,828 --> 01:16:34,538
No!

601
01:16:45,923 --> 01:16:47,715
Charlie?

602
01:16:48,633 --> 01:16:50,134
Charlie?

603
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:12,319
What?

604
01:19:41,692 --> 01:19:43,234
You Ok?

605
01:20:52,458 --> 01:20:53,542
Here.

606
01:21:09,347 --> 01:21:11,181
What is that?

607
01:21:11,432 --> 01:21:13,267
Looks like fat.

608
01:21:15,018 --> 01:21:16,770
You eat this?

609
01:21:22,608 --> 01:21:24,067
Pretty good.

610
01:21:48,713 --> 01:21:51,966
(Speaking Eskimo)

611
01:22:20,364 --> 01:22:21,698
I was just thinking about this...

612
01:22:21,739 --> 01:22:24,033
steak house in Montreal.

613
01:22:24,742 --> 01:22:26,077
Called "Moishe's".

614
01:22:28,995 --> 01:22:31,665
I use to always go there
with the fellas from my outfit.

615
01:22:31,915 --> 01:22:34,625
I'm tellin' ya, the
steaks in this joint

616
01:22:34,667 --> 01:22:37,294
were at least five inches thick.

617
01:22:38,504 --> 01:22:40,171
They had it all, boy.
They had...

618
01:22:40,463 --> 01:22:44,509
top sirloin, New York, rib eye...

619
01:22:45,384 --> 01:22:48,428
and you walk in there,
and you could smell it...

620
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:51,889
waft into the joint,
sizzling on the grill.

621
01:22:52,223 --> 01:22:56,477
They come to the table
with these giant spuds...

622
01:22:56,518 --> 01:23:00,563
just swimming in butter
and sour cream...

623
01:23:00,563 --> 01:23:03,357
and chives, and fried onions
and mushrooms...

624
01:23:04,817 --> 01:23:07,569
and the wine, just...

625
01:23:08,277 --> 01:23:10,738
flowing like bloody spring water.

626
01:23:10,988 --> 01:23:13,491
Course, the fellas would
get a little tight...

627
01:23:14,199 --> 01:23:18,578
gettin' lit up on the sauce,
and start jaw waggin' about...

628
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:22,206
all the crazy, dumb ass shit
we did during the war.

629
01:23:25,376 --> 01:23:27,252
Those were good times.

630
01:23:30,296 --> 01:23:34,216
Funny thing, you know, what
war does to some people.

631
01:23:38,594 --> 01:23:40,971
You know, you think
you know a fella...

632
01:23:43,765 --> 01:23:46,726
seems perfectly normal,
then one day...

633
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:51,021
the hammer drops,
and he snaps, you know?

634
01:23:51,313 --> 01:23:53,232
He falls all to pieces.

635
01:23:54,358 --> 01:23:56,108
Just because a...

636
01:23:57,485 --> 01:24:00,613
what we saw over there, you know,
what we saw during the war.

637
01:24:02,906 --> 01:24:07,159
Never in your wildest dreams
thought you'd see stuff like that.

638
01:24:09,787 --> 01:24:14,457
You never thought you could
do the things you did.

639
01:24:16,417 --> 01:24:21,338
Things you just grow
to hate yourself for.

640
01:24:24,757 --> 01:24:28,594
But somehow you know
you'll make your peace with it.

641
01:24:31,221 --> 01:24:33,264
At least you try.

642
01:24:38,101 --> 01:24:41,563
Soon, we walk.

643
01:24:47,652 --> 01:24:51,321
(Speaking Eskimo)

644
01:24:52,781 --> 01:24:54,406
Here.

645
01:24:54,698 --> 01:24:56,784
Put this around you.

646
01:25:02,246 --> 01:25:05,415
Oh, damn.

647
01:25:05,916 --> 01:25:08,001
That's enough for today.

648
01:25:09,628 --> 01:25:11,253
Ok?

649
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:13,547
Oh shit, you're burning up.

650
01:25:29,226 --> 01:25:30,770
It's Ok.

651
01:25:31,103 --> 01:25:32,646
It's Ok.

652
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:35,273
You just pushed yourself
too hard today.

653
01:25:38,485 --> 01:25:39,819
It's Ok.

654
01:25:51,829 --> 01:25:53,246
It's Ok.
It's Ok.

655
01:26:13,263 --> 01:26:15,223
How you doing?
You alright?

656
01:26:15,265 --> 01:26:16,974
I'm Ok.
Good.

657
01:28:01,351 --> 01:28:05,397
There was small girl.

658
01:28:12,486 --> 01:28:15,864
Family. Family hunting?
She was hunting with her family?

659
01:28:19,032 --> 01:28:22,452
Father...

660
01:28:27,373 --> 01:28:30,126
Father was hurt?
Couldn't hunt.

661
01:28:36,338 --> 01:28:38,382
The storm...
snow...

662
01:28:44,887 --> 01:28:48,598
Many days never eat.

663
01:28:51,268 --> 01:28:58,023
Tarquiup Inua took father...

664
01:28:59,525 --> 01:29:02,777
mother...

665
01:29:07,364 --> 01:29:12,034
She went away to die
because there was no food?

666
01:29:13,744 --> 01:29:15,287
More food for her.
Sure.

667
01:29:19,874 --> 01:29:22,877
Sister was dying.

668
01:29:28,799 --> 01:29:31,843
So the girl...

669
01:29:47,146 --> 01:29:49,232
You fed her with your blood.

670
01:30:02,326 --> 01:30:04,452
Then what happened?

671
01:30:06,246 --> 01:30:08,248
People came.

672
01:30:10,624 --> 01:30:12,960
But Tarquiup never came.

673
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,587
Tricked him.

674
01:30:40,982 --> 01:30:43,318
You are not going to freeze.

675
01:32:23,025 --> 01:32:26,653
Yeah, I figure just keep headin' north...

676
01:32:26,903 --> 01:32:30,031
We're bound to run into
a hunting party, or a village.

677
01:32:30,281 --> 01:32:32,199
Sooner or later.

678
01:32:32,491 --> 01:32:35,452
I can radio from Medivac
and get straight into a hospital.

679
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:39,830
They'll take care of
you in a hospital.

680
01:32:40,164 --> 01:32:42,249
They got good medicine
since the war.

681
01:32:45,418 --> 01:32:48,587
I'll tell you another thing.
We're not going to Yellowknife, either.

682
01:32:48,879 --> 01:32:51,590
Take you to the big city,
like Edminton.

683
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,884
Ever been to the city?

684
01:32:55,843 --> 01:32:58,012
You wouldn't believe your eyes.

685
01:32:58,054 --> 01:33:01,640
There's cars and people,
everywhere all over the streets.

686
01:33:03,683 --> 01:33:06,268
Millions of "cabunas"
everywhere.

687
01:33:08,854 --> 01:33:10,731
"Moishe's"?

688
01:33:11,565 --> 01:33:13,024
"Moishe's"

689
01:33:14,484 --> 01:33:16,736
No, that's in Montreal.

690
01:33:16,736 --> 01:33:18,487
But, they have the
same thing in Edminton.

691
01:33:19,112 --> 01:33:20,780
Plus, I'll tell you what...

692
01:33:21,031 --> 01:33:24,742
soon as you get out of the hospital,
I'll take you for a big steak dinner.

693
01:33:24,992 --> 01:33:26,911
Alright?

694
01:33:27,161 --> 01:33:31,247
Mushrooms...
potatoes and onions...

695
01:33:43,883 --> 01:33:46,552
I didn't know Charlie Holladay
for very long...

696
01:33:48,136 --> 01:33:50,638
but I do know he
was a good pilot...

697
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:54,099
and a good friend.

698
01:34:04,316 --> 01:34:07,652
We are gathered here today
because he was taken from us.

699
01:34:08,069 --> 01:34:09,946
Much too soon.

700
01:34:11,614 --> 01:34:16,284
Words are cold comfort when
a young life is cut so short.

701
01:34:20,705 --> 01:34:25,250
But I thought I might read
from a poem I found,

702
01:34:25,459 --> 01:34:30,254
written by a young Canadian flight lieutenant
named John McGee during the war

703
01:34:30,921 --> 01:34:34,090
and found in his locker
after he was shot down.

704
01:34:35,467 --> 01:34:39,179
"Oh, I have slipped the
surly bonds of Earth,

705
01:34:40,846 --> 01:34:44,850
and danced the skies
on laughter-silvered wings.

706
01:34:46,058 --> 01:34:48,102
Sunward I've climbed,

707
01:34:48,102 --> 01:34:52,355
and joined the tumbling mirth
of sun-split clouds --

708
01:34:52,981 --> 01:34:57,027
and done a hundred things
you have not dreamed of --

709
01:34:57,276 --> 01:35:03,406
wheeled and soared and swung
high in the sunlit silence.

710
01:35:03,489 --> 01:35:08,494
Hov'ring there,
I've chased the shouting wind along,

711
01:35:09,661 --> 01:35:12,998
and flung my eager craft
through footless halls of air.

712
01:35:13,623 --> 01:35:17,793
Up, up the long,
delirious burning blue,

713
01:35:18,711 --> 01:35:22,422
I've topped the windswept
heights with easy grace

714
01:35:22,714 --> 01:35:26,675
Where never lark,
or even eagle flew.

715
01:35:27,718 --> 01:35:30,971
And, while with silent, lifting mind

716
01:35:30,971 --> 01:35:35,391
I've trod the high untresspassed
sanctity of space,

717
01:35:36,559 --> 01:35:40,478
Put out my hand,

718
01:35:40,770 --> 01:35:42,939
and touched the face of God."

719
01:36:36,149 --> 01:36:40,778
Not very good boots.

720
01:36:45,031 --> 01:36:47,117
Thank you.

721
01:36:53,163 --> 01:36:55,206
My people.

722
01:37:03,088 --> 01:37:04,506
Brother.

723
01:37:05,305 --> 01:38:05,180
