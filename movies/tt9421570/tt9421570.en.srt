<i>No, no.</i>

23
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:17,546
Okay, so where are you at?

<i>Yeah, I did.</i>

31
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,911
You shouldn't do that. What did you take?

32
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,512
<i>Speed.</i>

33
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:34,983
Shoot it up or snorted?

34
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:41,350
Take a deep breathe and answer me.

35
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:43,452
<i>I can't breathe and I'm fucking scared.</i>

36
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:46,142
I understand,

37
00:02:48,457 --> 00:02:49,291
-Dru?
<i>-Yes. Yes.</i>

This is Joe.

45
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:11,473
<i>Joe, hey. Do you have time to answer
a couple of questions about tomorrow?</i>

46
00:03:11,557 --> 00:03:13,472
-Who is this?
<i>-I just have some questions.</i>

47
00:03:13,556 --> 00:03:15,576
-I asked who's calling.
<i>-It's Katherine Harbor.</i>

48
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:17,906
Are you a journalist?

49
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,898
<i>Yes. I thought I said I was.
I'm with L.A. Times.</i>

50
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:23,141
<i>Is this a bad time for you?
I can call back later.</i>

51
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:26,447
Shouldn't you introduce yourself properly
before you start asking me questions?

52
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:28,345
<i>I just want to get your side of the story.</i>

53
00:03:28,429 --> 00:03:29,597
How'd you get this number?

How'd you get this number?

56
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:34,613
As I said no comment.

57
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:35,533
Baylor.

58
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,575
No calls. I already told you this.

59
00:03:39,715 --> 00:03:41,342
I thought that was the fucking job.

60
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:45,096
<i>Hello, I'm sorry, I'm back.
Yes, what is it?</i>

61
00:03:52,346 --> 00:03:55,822

<i>Is this the fire department?

63
00:03:58,066 --> 00:03:59,522
No, ma'am, you've reached 911.

64
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,214
But I can connect you to fire--

65
00:04:01,305 --> 00:04:03,321
<i>I can see the flames
at the hill side to the east.

66
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:06,288
I understand, just hold one moment
I'll connect you to fire. Just hold.

67
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:07,559

<i>I'm in my car, man. Come quick!</i>

<i>Bro, doesn't your computer show that?</i>

81
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,176
No, unfortunately it's not exact.

82
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,463
<i>-Man, I need the fucking police!</i>
-And I need an address.

83
00:04:43,547 --> 00:04:46,790
I need you to get out of your car and read
me a street sign or give me a landmark.

84
00:04:46,874 --> 00:04:48,668
<i>I just told you I just got robbed!</i>

85
00:04:48,752 --> 00:04:50,106

00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:55,358
<i>A woman pulled a knife
and took my wallet and computer, okay?</i>

88

<i>It has all my work.</i>

89
00:04:57,156 --> 00:04:58,730
-And did this just happen?
<i>-Yes.</i>

90

<i>In my fucking car, man, I just told you.</i>

92
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:06,670
How'd she get in your car?

93

<i>I-- Does it matter?</i>

94
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:12,341
I'm-- Excuse me? I--

95
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:13,869
<i>She just jumped in, okay?</i>

96
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:16,896
-Jumped in.
<i>-Get the fuck outta here!</i>

97
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,611
<i>I told you you give me back my computer.</i>

98
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:21,656
-Do you see the Wells Fargo building?
<i>I'm on the phone with the police.</i>

99
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,972
-Sir?
<i>-Yes. I'm right below it.</i>

100
00:05:23,553 --> 00:05:26,163
You are on Bunker Hill,

<i>-This is fucking crazy.</i>

103
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:34,987
<i>On the car? Yes, there's a door.</i>

104
00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:38,818
Open it. Get out.
And get me your plate number.

105
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:41,388
<i>I told you I'm not getting out
of the fucking car.</i>

106
00:05:41,472 --> 00:05:43,533
All right, then it should be
on the registration

107
00:05:43,617 --> 00:05:45,473
that should be
in your glove compartment, sir.

108
00:05:45,557 --> 00:05:47,603
<i>Hey, man, can you tell me
how long it's gonna take?</i>

109
00:05:47,687 --> 00:05:50,030
<i>Aren't you supposed
to fucking protect me, man?</i>

00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:09,437

<i>She was voluptuous.</i>

125
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:28,867

00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,010
<i>No.</i>

477
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:39,282
We protect people that need help.

478
00:23:39,764 --> 00:23:42,454
<i>You help people? You took my Daddy away.</i>

479
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,790
<i>Where's my Mommy?</i>

480
00:23:51,403 --> 00:23:52,966
I'm gonna find your Mommy, all right?

481
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,686
And I'm gonna bring her back
to your and your little brother.

482
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,483
Okay, you want me do that?

483
00:24:01,097 --> 00:24:02,113
<i>I want Mommy.</i>

484
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,487
I know.

485
00:24:06,781 --> 00:24:08,700
I get scared being alone too, you know.

486
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,777
And you know what I do
when I'm lonely? I'd turn on the TV,

487
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:15,098
and I'd have company,
why wouldn't you go do that?

488
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:19,251
<i>It's broken.</i>

489
00:24:20,464 --> 00:24:22,751
Okay, why wouldn't you go sit
with your little brother?

490
00:24:26,338 --> 00:24:27,267
<i>He's sleeping.</i>

491
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:29,612
It's okay. You just go in there.

492
00:24:30,972 --> 00:24:32,279
<i>If I did it'd wake him up.</i>

493
00:24:32,812 --> 00:24:34,862
You won't wake him up
if you're very very quiet.

494
00:24:34,946 --> 00:24:36,462
And in the meantime.

495
00:24:36,546 --> 00:24:39,982
I'm gonna send some officers over there
to look after you and Oliver, okay?

496
00:24:41,252 --> 00:24:43,686
<i>I don't wanna talk anymore. I want Mommy.</i>

497
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,780
Okay, someone's gonna be with you soon.

498
00:24:45,864 --> 00:24:48,779
If you'll need help then call 911.

499
00:24:49,303 --> 00:24:50,590
Can you say that for me?

500
00:24:53,236 --> 00:24:54,526
<i>911.</i>

501
00:24:54,969 --> 00:24:57,022
Yeah, you just press
those numbers on the keypad.

502
00:24:57,106 --> 00:24:59,110
Just like when you call your Daddy, okay?

503
00:24:59,194 --> 00:25:01,941
That's right.
And my name is Joe. Can you say that?

504
00:25:04,585 --> 00:25:06,621
<i>911, Joe.</i>

505
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:07,579
Good.

506
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:09,609
Good girl, Abby.

507
00:25:09,693 --> 00:25:10,960
<i>Okay, bye bye.</i>

508
00:25:20,271 --> 00:25:21,244
What's going on?

509
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,827
What a-- Mind your own fucking business.

510
00:25:32,237 --> 00:25:34,294
Hey, has anyone got a call
from Emily LIGHTON?

511
00:25:34,378 --> 00:25:36,299
What's going on, Baylor?
What do you need?

512
00:25:36,383 --> 00:25:39,119
Just if you get a call
from Emily LIGHTON…

513
00:25:40,504 --> 00:25:41,943
-How about you, Manny?
-No.

514
00:25:52,081 --> 00:25:53,481
<i>-California Highway-</i>
-It's Joe.

515
00:25:54,325 --> 00:25:55,545
Plate number is California

516
00:25:55,629 --> 00:25:57,459
2FTD12K

517
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:03,648
<i>2FTD12K. I'll pass it on.</i>

518
00:26:03,732 --> 00:26:05,089
She's with her ex, Henry Fisher.

519
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:06,556
He took her.

520
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:08,458
<i>10-4. (OK)</i>

521
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:09,856
The suspect has a knife.

522
00:26:11,187 --> 00:26:12,183
<i>I'll pass it on.</i>

523
00:26:12,267 --> 00:26:13,413
And history of assault.

524
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,447
<i>I'll relay the plate number.</i>

525
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:17,637
Okay, is there a unit
you can send to her house?

526
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:20,881
<i>I have to relay the plate now.</i>

527
00:26:20,965 --> 00:26:22,263
Right, but what's your plan?

528
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,463
<i>To wait until they find the van?</i>

529
00:26:24,547 --> 00:26:26,074
Yeah, but you need a plan.

530
00:26:26,158 --> 00:26:27,250
<i>-Joe.</i>
-There's a little--

531
00:26:27,334 --> 00:26:30,436
<i>The quicker they get the plate number
the faster we'll find them, right?</i>

532
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:32,558
No, no. Listen. You have to--

533
00:26:32,642 --> 00:26:34,902
<i>Okay, thanks for the plate number.</i>

534
00:26:34,986 --> 00:26:37,355
No, no. Listen, I was thinking
that if you could send--

535
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:38,825
<i>No, you listen.</i>

536
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:40,375
<i>Listen.</i>

537
00:26:40,459 --> 00:26:42,720
<i>I am up to my ass in calls.</i>

538
00:26:42,804 --> 00:26:45,851
<i>Wait for her to call back,
do your job and I'll do mine, okay?</i>

539
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:50,515
<i>Okay?</i>

540
00:26:53,704 --> 00:26:54,550
Yeah.

541
00:26:57,702 --> 00:26:58,548
<i>Good.</i>

542
00:26:59,982 --> 00:27:00,869
Oh, by the way--

543
00:27:11,324 --> 00:27:13,817
16A71, 16A71.

544
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:16,907
Welfare check
on 5800 Regis St., apartment 6.

545
00:27:16,991 --> 00:27:18,617
Two juveniles, home alone.

546
00:27:19,123 --> 00:27:19,964
Respond, code 2.

547
00:27:21,063 --> 00:27:22,329
<i>16A71, roger.</i>

548
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:25,584
<i>Be advised, we're stacked up
on multiple fire calls.</i>

549
00:27:28,702 --> 00:27:29,537
16A--

550
00:27:36,391 --> 00:27:37,318
Shit.

551
00:27:38,354 --> 00:27:39,198
Jess?

552
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:42,687
<i>Joe, I want you to be able to tell
your side of the story. It runs tomorrow.</i>

553
00:27:42,771 --> 00:27:44,483
-Who is this?
<i>-I just have a few questions.</i>

554
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:45,412
Who is this?

555
00:27:45,496 --> 00:27:47,511
<i>It's Katherine Harbor
from the Los Angeles Times.</i>

556
00:27:47,595 --> 00:27:49,977
-Katherine Harbor? Stop calling me!
<i>-Listen to me-</i>

557
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:04,829
Hey, Manny.

558
00:28:07,142 --> 00:28:08,502
Hey, is it cold in here?

559
00:28:09,284 --> 00:28:10,418
Feels all right to me.

560
00:28:14,148 --> 00:28:15,052
Manny.

561
00:28:15,136 --> 00:28:15,989
Yeah?

562
00:28:17,964 --> 00:28:19,074
I've been an asshole.

563
00:28:21,148 --> 00:28:22,976
Not just today, but in general.

564
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:23,906
Yes, you have.

565
00:28:27,277 --> 00:28:28,749
We should get a beer some time.

566
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,291
That sounds good, man.

567
00:28:38,568 --> 00:28:39,928
Hey, I've got…

568
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:41,343
I have a technical question.

569
00:28:41,427 --> 00:28:42,267
Sure.

570
00:28:42,775 --> 00:28:45,524
If I logout of my computer
and I login into another one,

571
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:47,392
will I still get the same calls?

572
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,467
Yes, they follow your login,
not your computer.

573
00:28:49,551 --> 00:28:51,518
So your system can go anywhere you go.

574
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,023
Where are you going? We are off of 15s.

575
00:28:57,664 --> 00:28:58,544
How about the beer?

576
00:29:11,448 --> 00:29:13,207
JOE BAYLOR #625

577
00:29:26,027 --> 00:29:27,087
FISHER, HENRY

578
00:29:27,171 --> 00:29:29,150
AREA RTO

579
00:29:31,411 --> 00:29:34,205
<i>LAPD Communications.
This Sgt. Miller.</i>

580
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:35,429
Hey, Sarge, it's Joe.

581
00:29:36,095 --> 00:29:37,622
<i>Hey, Christ.</i>

582
00:29:38,164 --> 00:29:39,149
<i>You ever go home?</i>

583
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:40,429
Am I interrupting something?

584
00:29:40,513 --> 00:29:43,752
<i>Oh, God, no.
This is more boring than taking a shit.</i>

585
00:29:44,276 --> 00:29:45,470
Not if you constipated.

586
00:29:46,057 --> 00:29:47,271
<i>Well, yeah. That's true.</i>

587
00:29:48,384 --> 00:29:49,251
You got a sec?

588
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,830
<i>Sure, man,
it's calm down here, what's up?</i>

589
00:29:53,781 --> 00:29:55,354
I need you to do me a favor.

590
00:29:56,821 --> 00:29:58,101
<i>Sure thing, what do you need?</i>

591
00:29:58,185 --> 00:30:01,959
Okay, could you send a car over
to 5800 Regis St., apartment 6?

592
00:30:02,043 --> 00:30:02,879
It's urgent.

593
00:30:02,963 --> 00:30:04,257
<i>Yeah, you got it. Why?</i>

594
00:30:04,766 --> 00:30:07,035
I'm working a convicted felon
who kidnapped his ex-wife.

595
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:09,392
Left two kids at the mother's house.
They're alone.

596
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:11,366
I need someone to the send
a unit over there.

597
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,617
<i>Okay, how do you know
the kids are in there?</i>

598
00:30:14,701 --> 00:30:16,254
I spoke to a girl, Abby.

599
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,348
<i>All right, and are the parents home?</i>

600
00:30:19,866 --> 00:30:22,506
No, he took her, and they're mobile.
Somewhere East to the city.

601
00:30:23,032 --> 00:30:24,859
<i>And did you talk to CHP?</i>

602
00:30:24,943 --> 00:30:26,914
Yes, but CHP is looking for the vehicle.

603
00:30:26,998 --> 00:30:27,928
But, Sarge, look…

604
00:30:29,151 --> 00:30:30,256
They don't live together

605
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,501
and both of their residence
are under our jurisdiction.

606
00:30:32,585 --> 00:30:35,695
So, I need you to send
a unit over to the mother's house.

607
00:30:36,414 --> 00:30:39,950
And I need you to send another unit
over to his house.

608
00:30:40,885 --> 00:30:43,041
<i>Is there anyone at his house?</i>

609
00:30:43,543 --> 00:30:44,709
I think he lives alone,

610
00:30:44,793 --> 00:30:47,511
but there might be clues
to where they are going or where he is.

611
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,757
<i>Joe--</i>

612
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:50,987
Look, we need to hurry.

613
00:30:51,071 --> 00:30:52,564
Get a unit over to the mother's house

614
00:30:52,648 --> 00:30:55,693
and then send one over to his and kick
his fucking door in if you have to.

615
00:30:57,457 --> 00:30:58,933
<i>What was that?</i>

616
00:30:59,017 --> 00:31:00,437
Kick his fucking door in.

617
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:04,125
<i>Joe, excuse me?</i>

618
00:31:04,209 --> 00:31:06,316
I talked to a terrified six year old girl

619
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,634
and I promised her
that her mother would come home.

620
00:31:08,718 --> 00:31:11,945
<i>I'm assuming that there's no warrant
for his residence,</i>

621
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:14,368
<i>so I'm gonna send someone
to the mother's house to check--</i>

622
00:31:14,452 --> 00:31:16,008
No! No!

623
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:19,868
I need you to send a unit
over to his house,

624
00:31:19,952 --> 00:31:22,464
and I need you to send a unit
over to her house.

625
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,734
<i>Joe, it's too much.</i>

626
00:31:24,818 --> 00:31:25,846
No, goddamnit, Bill.

627
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:29,346
There is a scared little girl
whose mother has been abducted.

628
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,793
<i>That's enough! It's enough!
What are you trying to do?</i>

629
00:31:32,844 --> 00:31:34,957
<i>You are in enough trouble already.</i>

630
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:37,253
<i>I will send a car to the mother's house.</i>

631
00:31:37,337 --> 00:31:40,200
<i>But I'm not gonna have anyone
kicking in any fucking doors.</i>

632
00:31:42,014 --> 00:31:43,114
<i>It's not your job.</i>

633
00:31:44,951 --> 00:31:45,881
I know that.

634
00:31:45,965 --> 00:31:47,325
<i>Yeah, well, apparently you don't.</i>

635
00:31:50,464 --> 00:31:52,171
<i>Does it have anything to do with tomorrow?</i>

636
00:31:53,173 --> 00:31:54,680
What? No, I'm just trying to…

637
00:31:56,146 --> 00:31:58,859
<i>-Do you wanna talk to psychologist?</i>
-I'm just trying to help…

638
00:31:59,568 --> 00:32:01,258
<i>-Do you need to do that?</i>
-No. No.

639
00:32:01,342 --> 00:32:03,389
<i>I know you didn't get along
with the last one.</i>

640
00:32:03,913 --> 00:32:05,076
No, no. I'm fine.

641
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,478
<i>-What's that?</i>
-No, I'm fine.

642
00:32:07,223 --> 00:32:08,062
<i>Okay.</i>

643
00:32:08,565 --> 00:32:10,566
<i>All right, so then, when are you off?</i>

644
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:13,525
I don't know. Ten minutes.

645
00:32:14,896 --> 00:32:15,759
<i>Okay. Good.</i>

646
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:18,054
<i>Then you gonna go to the court tomorrow.</i>

647
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:21,324
<i>And then afterwards,
you'll be back on the street</i>

648
00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:22,695
<i>and you'll be off the phone.</i>

649
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:26,946
<i>That's what you want, isn't it?</i>

650
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,024
Yeah.

651
00:32:30,889 --> 00:32:31,987
<i>Isn't it, Joe?</i>

652
00:32:32,071 --> 00:32:33,118
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

653
00:32:36,386 --> 00:32:37,239
<i>All right.</i>

654
00:32:37,739 --> 00:32:38,653
<i>Okay.</i>

655
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,230
<i>Send my love to Jess.</i>

656
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:42,921
She's not here.

657
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:45,541
<i>When you get home.</i>

658
00:32:46,568 --> 00:32:47,701
<i>I'll talk to you later.</i>

659
00:32:47,785 --> 00:32:48,705
Yeah.

660
00:33:06,699 --> 00:33:10,386
<i>This is Emily LIGHTON,
I can't come to the phone right now, so…</i>

661
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,097
<i>Stop it.</i>

662
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:15,229
<i>Leave me a message,
call later, or send a text.</i>

663
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:27,335
CHP

664
00:33:30,661 --> 00:33:32,864
<i>-California Highway--</i>
-It's Joe, you found a van?

665
00:33:34,086 --> 00:33:35,726
<i>No, not yet.</i>

666
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:39,927
<i>Why are you calling, you have an update?</i>

667
00:33:42,285 --> 00:33:43,818
No. No.

668
00:34:11,057 --> 00:34:13,270
JESS

669
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:24,688
Jess?

670
00:34:28,515 --> 00:34:30,049
Hello? Hello, can you--

671
00:34:30,866 --> 00:34:32,039
Did I wake you up?

672
00:34:33,945 --> 00:34:35,392
<i>You have to stop doing this, Joe.</i>

673
00:34:39,174 --> 00:34:40,167
You're up late.

674
00:34:40,738 --> 00:34:41,843
<i>Come on./<i>

675
00:34:42,376 --> 00:34:46,190
<i>We've been separated for six month.
I'm not gonna keep doing this with you.</i>

676
00:34:46,692 --> 00:34:48,431
I just want to say goodnight to Page.

677
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:52,126
<i>Okay, well, she's asleep, Joe.</i>

678
00:34:53,422 --> 00:34:55,042
I was thinking about her.

679
00:34:55,828 --> 00:34:57,781
<i>It's two o'clock in the morning.</i>

680
00:35:01,326 --> 00:35:02,719
<i>Hey, listen to me, Joe, you…</i>

681
00:35:03,928 --> 00:35:05,402
<i>You can't keep doing this.</i>

682
00:35:06,748 --> 00:35:09,819
<i>Okay? It's confusing to her,
don't you get that? We agreed--</i>

683
00:35:09,903 --> 00:35:11,746
I just wanna talk
to my fucking daughter.

684
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:12,673
I don't under--

685
00:35:12,757 --> 00:35:15,047
<i>-Rules… Don't you get that?</i>
-Come on, Jess.

686
00:35:15,131 --> 00:35:16,142
<i>Cause it's just like…</i>

687
00:35:16,642 --> 00:35:18,872
<i>You keep doing whatever
you want time after time.</i>

688
00:35:18,956 --> 00:35:21,528
<i>You don't even give a shit
about what's best for everybody else.</i>

689
00:35:21,612 --> 00:35:23,511
All right. All right. Jesus Christ.

690
00:35:26,518 --> 00:35:29,416
<i>Jesus Christ? You know what?
I'm not doing this with you.</i>

691
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,387
Just hold on. Hold on. Wait, wait.

692
00:35:32,908 --> 00:35:33,774
Just wait.

693
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,975
How was the--

694
00:35:40,365 --> 00:35:42,526
That job interview? The one--

695
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,937
The one at the art place.

696
00:35:48,492 --> 00:35:49,432
<i>It's next week.</i>

697
00:35:51,267 --> 00:35:52,113
Oh.

698
00:35:53,927 --> 00:35:54,814
<i>Oh.</i>

699
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:01,160
Look, I'm just-- I'm--

700
00:36:02,234 --> 00:36:04,567
I'm late, I'm losing track of time.

701
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:07,785
I just-- Like--

702
00:36:08,899 --> 00:36:10,592
I just can't sleep in that Airbnb.

703
00:36:11,094 --> 00:36:13,654
And I just keep watching too much TV.

704
00:36:16,373 --> 00:36:17,226
Yeah.

705
00:36:21,204 --> 00:36:22,722
<i>Okay, Joe…</i>

706
00:36:24,693 --> 00:36:26,464
<i>Look, I'm gonna go back to sleep.</i>

707
00:36:26,548 --> 00:36:28,508
Wait, wait. Wait.

708
00:36:29,493 --> 00:36:33,176
Have you talked to Vicky about Rick?

709
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,687
<i>Jesus, please. Please, Joe.
You said you wouldn't do this with me.</i>

710
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:41,105
<i>God.</i>

711
00:36:43,705 --> 00:36:44,994
<i>Yeah.</i>

712
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,910
<i>Vicky said that there were…</i>

713
00:36:47,745 --> 00:36:51,292
<i>There were federal officers over there
the other day offering him something.</i>

714
00:36:52,652 --> 00:36:55,445
<i>Maybe immunity? I don't know, Joe, please.</i>

715
00:36:59,365 --> 00:37:00,582
Were they over at our house?

716
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:04,386
<i>Just stop. I'm not doing this, Joe.</i>

717
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,072
Why didn't you just call me
and tell me that?

718
00:37:12,527 --> 00:37:13,680
They were over at our house?

719
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:15,369
<i>No, okay? Nobody came to our house.</i>

720
00:37:15,453 --> 00:37:17,294
<i>Nobody came to our house, all right?</i>

721
00:37:18,616 --> 00:37:19,456
<i>Okay?</i>

722
00:37:21,165 --> 00:37:22,231
Are you coming tomorrow?

723
00:37:25,424 --> 00:37:28,020
<i>You know, I don't really think
that's such a good idea, Joe.</i>

724
00:37:28,104 --> 00:37:31,093
Cause you know it would look
really good to have the wife there.

725
00:37:31,598 --> 00:37:32,464
You know?

726
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:33,965
<i>Right.</i>

727
00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:35,428
<i>Okay.</i>

728
00:37:35,942 --> 00:37:37,465
<i>-I'm gonna go, Joe.</i>
-What did I--

729
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:40,910
-Why are you being like-- What did I say?
<i>-I'm hanging up. I'm hanging up.</i>

730
00:37:40,994 --> 00:37:42,546
-What did I--
<i>-Good luck tomorrow.</i>

731
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,730
Jess.

732
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:18,755
Yes?

733
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,029
<i>Barracuda. Now.</i>

734
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,178
<i>The doorman just attacked us.</i>

735
00:38:22,262 --> 00:38:24,504
<i>-Send the police down here now!</i>
-Where are you?

736
00:38:24,588 --> 00:38:27,086
<i>We're at the fucking Barracuda,
I just told you that.</i>

737
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,558
I need an address.

738
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:29,933
<i>Hey, hey, get away from him!</i>

739
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:31,368
Sir, are you in the valley?

740
00:38:31,886 --> 00:38:32,848
<i>Get away from him!</i>

741
00:38:32,932 --> 00:38:35,210
<i>You know what, fuck this.
Fuck this. I'll figure it out.</i>

742
00:38:35,294 --> 00:38:37,257
Hey, you need
to let the police come there--

743
00:38:37,341 --> 00:38:38,323
<i>Fuck you. Forget it.</i>

744
00:38:38,407 --> 00:38:39,553
Fuck me?

745
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:42,785
-Fuck me?
<i>-Yeah, fuck you. Go to hell.</i>

746
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:44,502
All right, now, fuck you!

747
00:38:52,127 --> 00:38:54,171
HENRY. 213-100-7200

748
00:39:19,061 --> 00:39:21,374
OLIVER. KNIFE

749
00:39:33,354 --> 00:39:34,323
Henry?

750
00:39:37,162 --> 00:39:38,302
<i>Who is this?</i>

751
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:43,317
This is Officer Joe Baylor, LAPD.
Sorry to call so late.

752
00:39:43,401 --> 00:39:45,424
You know your daughter
and son are home alone?

753
00:39:45,973 --> 00:39:47,444
<i>My wife and I are separated.</i>

754
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:48,886
<i>We're separated.</i>

755
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,267
Do you know where your wife is?

756
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:53,462
<i>No.</i>

757
00:39:53,546 --> 00:39:55,699
When was the last time
you saw her or talked to her?

758
00:39:57,798 --> 00:39:59,141
<i>-I don't know.</i>
-Whoa.

759
00:39:59,641 --> 00:40:02,027
Don't you think you should go
and check in on the children?

760
00:40:02,536 --> 00:40:03,528
<i>No.</i>

761
00:40:03,871 --> 00:40:05,988
<i>I can't do that right now.</i>

762
00:40:06,535 --> 00:40:08,941
What… Are you busy with something?

763
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:11,344
<i>Yeah.</i>

764
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,095
I know Emily's with you.

765
00:40:20,547 --> 00:40:22,156
<i>You don't know shit.</i>

766
00:40:23,312 --> 00:40:24,789
Where are you going?

767
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:27,580
<i>What?</i>

768
00:40:27,664 --> 00:40:29,538
Where are you going?

769
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,305
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

770
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,328
Oi, I know you've been to LAC, huh?

771
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:38,456
-I know you've done time at LAC, huh?
<i>-What?</i>

772
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,398
You wanna fucking do more?

773
00:40:40,549 --> 00:40:42,461
Huh? You wanna do more?

774
00:40:49,954 --> 00:40:50,852
<i>This is Henry.</i>

775
00:40:50,936 --> 00:40:52,876
Fuck, fuck!

776
00:41:15,676 --> 00:41:17,099
<i>What's up, partner?</i>

777
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,206
Everything all right?

778
00:41:18,304 --> 00:41:20,023
<i>Yeah. Yeah. Something wrong?</i>

779
00:41:20,118 --> 00:41:21,320
Where are you?

780
00:41:22,473 --> 00:41:24,170
<i>At the station, I just got off duty.</i>

781
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,162
<i>Bueno.</i> Do me a favor.

782
00:41:27,271 --> 00:41:28,376
<i>Sure, what is it?</i>

783
00:41:28,568 --> 00:41:29,755
Is your car there?

784
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:30,917
<i>Uh, at the station.</i>

785
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:32,464
I need to go to Foothill. All right?

786
00:41:32,548 --> 00:41:34,454
I'll explain to you
when you get there, right?

787
00:41:34,538 --> 00:41:35,440
<i>Yes.</i>

788
00:41:35,524 --> 00:41:36,393
Rick.

789
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,539
You're not at the station. Are you?

790
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:47,804
<i>Yeah, I am.</i>

791
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:51,899
You don't sound like you.
You sound strange.

792
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:55,359
Have you been drinking?

793
00:41:56,035 --> 00:41:57,320
<i>I'm not strange.</i>

794
00:42:02,412 --> 00:42:04,005
You haven't been drinking, have you?

795
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,208
<i>Nope.</i>

796
00:42:06,472 --> 00:42:09,333
<i>-Joe…</i>
-You don't drink, Rick.

797
00:42:11,011 --> 00:42:12,128
You don't drink.

798
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:14,917
<i>I know. How many times
are you gonna say that?</i>

799
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,682
You're my wit…
You're my witness tomorrow.

800
00:42:18,766 --> 00:42:19,841
<i>I know, I know.</i>

801
00:42:19,925 --> 00:42:22,181
I can't have you coming
to court courthouse hung over?

802
00:42:22,327 --> 00:42:23,759
<i>No, of course not.</i>

803
00:42:30,605 --> 00:42:31,530
<i>It's just that…</i>

804
00:42:31,761 --> 00:42:32,647
What?

805
00:42:37,632 --> 00:42:40,174
<i>Just, I'm fucking afraid.</i>

806
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,809
<i>This isn't gonna go our way.</i>

807
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:46,106
<i>I had the feds at my house this morning.</i>

808
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:47,385
<i>You understand?</i>

809
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,025
<i>I'm afraid.</i>

810
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,478
<i>I might say the wrong thing.</i>

811
00:42:50,562 --> 00:42:53,054
-Hey, hey, I know. I know.
<i>-Joe, I'm afraid.</i>

812
00:42:55,163 --> 00:42:56,944
You're not gonna say
the wrong thing, right?

813
00:42:57,811 --> 00:43:00,178
After tomorrow, you know,
we're just, we'll back at it.

814
00:43:00,262 --> 00:43:01,202
<i>Joe.</i>

815
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,882
<i>I'm tired of this. It's been eight months.</i>

816
00:43:05,966 --> 00:43:08,047
I know, I know. Me too, homie.

817
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:09,552
I know.

818
00:43:11,114 --> 00:43:12,841
-I know.
-Yeah.

819
00:43:13,295 --> 00:43:14,208
<i>Yeah.</i>

820
00:43:27,575 --> 00:43:28,893
Hey, how much you had to drink?

821
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:30,707
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

822
00:43:31,535 --> 00:43:33,888
<i>-Just wanted to…</i>
-All right, so you can still drive?

823
00:43:33,972 --> 00:43:35,901
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-I need you to go…

824
00:43:36,845 --> 00:43:42,953
to 1605 N. Tujunga, in Foothill.
All right?

825
00:43:43,511 --> 00:43:45,692
A Henry Fisher lives there. All right?

826
00:43:48,182 --> 00:43:49,104
Baylor.

827
00:43:49,855 --> 00:43:51,299
-You got it?
<i>-Got it.</i>

828
00:43:51,575 --> 00:43:53,597
Okay. All right. Just drive safe.

829
00:43:53,752 --> 00:43:55,010
All right and hurry.

830
00:43:56,945 --> 00:43:59,389
What, am I not supposed
to talk in here either?

831
00:44:00,187 --> 00:44:02,029
No, in here is fine.

832
00:44:02,165 --> 00:44:04,368
You could do something
about your attitude though.

833
00:44:07,289 --> 00:44:08,171
What?

834
00:44:09,483 --> 00:44:11,246
-You got a phone call. A little girl.
-Abby?

835
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:14,382
I don't know. She didn't tell me her name.
Do you want me to put her through?

836
00:44:14,466 --> 00:44:16,272
Yeah. Put her through, yes.

837
00:44:16,962 --> 00:44:18,098
You wanna try that again?

838
00:44:19,684 --> 00:44:20,798
-Sorry.
-Okay.

839
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:30,900
Abby?

840
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:33,136
<i>I'm not supposed to open the door.</i>

841
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:36,799
It's okay. All right. They're my friends.
It's the police. You can let them in.

842
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,128
<i>Mommy said not to.</i>

843
00:44:38,274 --> 00:44:39,600
It's okay. It's okay.

844
00:44:39,684 --> 00:44:42,836
They're gonna, they're gonna stay with you
until your mommy comes home.

845
00:44:43,459 --> 00:44:44,712
<i>Hi, my name is Tim.</i>

846
00:44:44,796 --> 00:44:46,292
<i>-This is Nadia.
-Hi.</i>

847
00:44:46,665 --> 00:44:48,172
<i>We're police officers.</i>

848
00:44:48,946 --> 00:44:50,533
<i>-Is that for me?
-Yes.</i>

849
00:44:52,459 --> 00:44:54,262
<i>Hello? Officer Jim Gervasi.</i>

850
00:44:54,346 --> 00:44:56,780
Hi, this is officer Joe Baylor,
LAPD communications.

851
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:59,421
<i>Hi, we're checking in on two kids.</i>

852
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,505
Yes, Abby and her little brother.

853
00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:04,056
I have to keep the line open
because her mother might call.

854
00:45:04,437 --> 00:45:07,325
-I think probably you can find the…
<i>-Did you hurt yourself, Abby?</i>

855
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:08,468
<i>It's not mine.</i>

856
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,402
<i>She has blood on her hands and shirt.</i>

857
00:45:12,845 --> 00:45:13,956
What's going on?

858
00:45:17,716 --> 00:45:18,739
Check on Oliver.

859
00:45:19,078 --> 00:45:21,653
<i>Abby? Do you know where
your little brother is?</i>

860
00:45:21,737 --> 00:45:22,766
<i>He's sleeping.</i>

861
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:25,344
<i>Okay. All right. You just wait here
with Nadia, all right?</i>

862
00:45:25,428 --> 00:45:26,774
<i>Wait here with me.</i>

863
00:45:27,252 --> 00:45:28,783
<i>Oh, this place isn't right.</i>

864
00:45:29,145 --> 00:45:30,981
<i>-Hello.</i>
-Just find Oliver.

865
00:45:32,471 --> 00:45:33,631
<i>Do you know where he is?</i>

866
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:35,930
<i>I don't know. Just look around.</i>

867
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:38,274
<i>Okay. I'm in the kitchen right now, it's…</i>

868
00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:42,595
<i>There's the bedroom.</i>

869
00:45:43,072 --> 00:45:44,484
-Did you find him?
<i>-This must be it.</i>

870
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:48,991
Tim, are you there?

871
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,735
<i>Hold that, hold that. Listen,
there's blood stains on the floor.</i>

872
00:45:53,325 --> 00:45:54,258
<i>Oh my Gosh.</i>

873
00:45:54,984 --> 00:45:56,501
<i>LAPD, we need medical immediately.</i>

874
00:45:56,585 --> 00:45:57,519
What's going on?

875
00:46:00,235 --> 00:46:01,242
Tim, what's going on?

876
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:02,282
<i>Close the door.</i>

877
00:46:02,366 --> 00:46:03,670
<i>Nadia, get in here.</i>

878
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:05,211
Tim?

879
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:06,780
<i>Alright, I'm coming, I'm coming.</i>

880
00:46:07,122 --> 00:46:08,078
<i>Are you there?</i>

881
00:46:08,492 --> 00:46:11,436
<i>-Just check if he's breathing, all right?
-All right, I'm on it.</i>

882
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,863
Tim, what the fuck is going on?

883
00:46:12,947 --> 00:46:14,879
What the fuck is wrong with you?
What's going on?

884
00:46:14,963 --> 00:46:17,015
<i>-I don't think he's breathing.
-Abby, stay outside.</i>

885
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:19,403
-Tim?
<i>-Nadia, close the door.</i>

886
00:46:19,487 --> 00:46:20,931
<i>-Abby, get back.
-Are you okay?</i>

887
00:46:21,015 --> 00:46:23,409
-Tim?
<i>-What's wrong with Oliver?</i>

888
00:46:23,493 --> 00:46:24,978
<i>-Nadia, stay with him.
-I'm on it.</i>

889
00:46:25,062 --> 00:46:26,265
<i>Abby, just come with…</i>

890
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:28,250
Yo. Tim? Tim?

891
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:32,521
Joe.

892
00:46:33,343 --> 00:46:35,557
The shift is over day.
Day Watch is here. We're off.

893
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:42,757
I think I'm gonna stick around
for a while.

894
00:46:49,737 --> 00:46:50,760
Joe.

895
00:46:52,331 --> 00:46:54,136
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah.

896
00:46:55,917 --> 00:46:58,221
Look, good luck tomorrow, huh?

897
00:47:20,725 --> 00:47:21,776
<i>Don't call me.</i>

898
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,872
I know what you did to the baby.

899
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,466
<i>Shh, don't call me. Don't call me.</i>

900
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:26,892
Abby saw what you did to Oliver.

901
00:47:26,976 --> 00:47:28,588
What? Are you going to kill her now too?

902
00:47:28,672 --> 00:47:31,020
<i>No, I told her not to go in there.
She shouldn't have gone.</i>

903
00:47:31,104 --> 00:47:32,481
She's six years old.

904
00:47:33,176 --> 00:47:34,870
What did you think she was gonna do?

905
00:47:35,449 --> 00:47:38,120
She is covered in his blood.

906
00:47:40,075 --> 00:47:41,975
Henry, this stops here right now.

907
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:45,340
You stop the car and you tell me
where you are. I will send help.

908
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:47,357
<i>I can't do that.</i>

909
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:48,363
You have to.

910
00:47:49,902 --> 00:47:51,222
<i>But if I do…</i>

911
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,487
Yes?

912
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,686
<i>-What will happen?</i>
-To you?

913
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:58,758
-You go back to prison.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

914
00:47:59,235 --> 00:48:00,266
<i>No, that can't happen.</i>

915
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:02,606
Well, you think that can't happen?
That can't happen?

916
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:04,611
What do you want me to say?
That you're a victim?

917
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:06,380
Huh, Henry? You think you're a victim?

918
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:07,496
You're not a victim.

919
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:08,816
Emily is a victim.

920
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,130
Oliver is a victim.

921
00:48:10,214 --> 00:48:11,881
Abby is a victim. You're not a victim.

922
00:48:11,965 --> 00:48:15,949
You're a-- You should be fucking executed.

923
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:23,264
<i>This is Henry. Leave a message.</i>

924
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:27,083
<i>This is Henry. Leave a…</i>

925
00:48:28,575 --> 00:48:30,427
-Rick.
<i>-I'm at the address.</i>

926
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:32,261
<i>Some courtyard apartments.</i>

927
00:48:32,552 --> 00:48:34,341
<i>Looks like nobody's home.
The lights are out.</i>

928
00:48:34,425 --> 00:48:35,643
-Kick the door in.
<i>-What?</i>

929
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:36,792
Just trust me.

930
00:48:38,316 --> 00:48:40,237
<i>Stop fucking around, Joe.
Tell me why I'm here.</i>

931
00:48:40,321 --> 00:48:42,831
The man who lived there
killed one of his kids, a baby.

932
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:46,520
And then he abducted his ex-wife,
we need to know where they are going.

933
00:48:48,785 --> 00:48:49,799
<i>How did you get this?</i>

934
00:48:53,435 --> 00:48:54,832
Answering a 911 call.

935
00:48:54,916 --> 00:48:57,525
<i>Of course you did. Fucking shit, man.</i>

936
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:00,751
<i>Hello?</i>

937
00:49:01,455 --> 00:49:02,650
<i>Hello? Police.</i>

938
00:49:03,335 --> 00:49:05,998
<i>Hello, this is the police.</i>

939
00:49:06,878 --> 00:49:10,277
Whoa. What's going on?
Rick, Rick, what's up?

940
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:11,361
Rick?

941
00:49:11,452 --> 00:49:13,932
<i>They have a fucking dog
on a chain in the house.</i>

942
00:49:15,395 --> 00:49:16,269
Fuck.

943
00:49:17,074 --> 00:49:18,793
All right. Did you get in?

944
00:49:21,055 --> 00:49:22,142
-Did you get in?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

945
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:23,789
-All right.
<i>-Yeah. The door was open.</i>

946
00:49:23,873 --> 00:49:25,391
<i>Yeah, they must've been in a hurry.</i>

947
00:49:25,475 --> 00:49:26,374
Look around.

948
00:49:30,275 --> 00:49:31,590
<i>There's not much.</i>

949
00:49:33,578 --> 00:49:34,935
<i>Place is practically empty.</i>

950
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:38,625
<i>Mattress, some toys, unopened.</i>

951
00:49:39,773 --> 00:49:40,845
<i>There's something else.</i>

952
00:49:40,928 --> 00:49:43,867
<i>A stack of letters on the floor.
An address book.</i>

953
00:49:44,608 --> 00:49:46,287
<i>Damn, a lot of bills.</i>

954
00:49:46,371 --> 00:49:48,435
<i>DWP, parking ticket, parking ticket.</i>

955
00:49:49,209 --> 00:49:51,310
<i>There's like five parking violations.</i>

956
00:49:51,394 --> 00:49:52,342
What else?

957
00:49:53,973 --> 00:49:57,137
<i>Come on. I can't, Joe. There's--
So much shit here.</i>

958
00:49:57,221 --> 00:49:58,369
Rick, Rick, please.

959
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:04,481
<i>It'll take me hours to realize
how many letters and papers there are.</i>

960
00:50:04,572 --> 00:50:06,024
<i>She'll be dead by the time I'm done.</i>

961
00:50:06,108 --> 00:50:07,814
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

962
00:50:10,447 --> 00:50:11,408
<i>Nothing.</i>

963
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,715
<i>-Time is against us.</i>
-Right. So get going.

964
00:50:13,864 --> 00:50:15,150
All right? You got it?

965
00:50:15,604 --> 00:50:16,440
<i>Yeah.</i>

966
00:50:23,915 --> 00:50:24,758
Emily.

967
00:50:28,664 --> 00:50:30,289
Emily, you listening? Do you hear me?

968
00:50:34,569 --> 00:50:35,494
<i>Abby.</i>

969
00:50:35,585 --> 00:50:36,428
Okay.

970
00:50:36,512 --> 00:50:38,014
<i>Hey, give me the phone.</i>

971
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:39,889
Emily.

972
00:50:39,979 --> 00:50:42,192
<i>-Give me the phone.</i>
-You have your seat belt on?

973
00:50:43,476 --> 00:50:44,374
<i>No.</i>

974
00:50:44,617 --> 00:50:45,882
-Does Henry?
<i>-Come on.</i>

975
00:50:47,614 --> 00:50:49,551
<i>-No.</i>
-Put yours on.

976
00:50:49,682 --> 00:50:51,877
<i>Come on. Give me the phone.
I need to talk to her now.</i>

977
00:50:51,961 --> 00:50:53,736
<i>-What is she saying?</i>
-Is it on?

978
00:50:55,299 --> 00:50:56,384
<i>Yes.</i>

979
00:50:56,705 --> 00:50:57,783
Okay.

980
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,559
Now listen,

981
00:51:00,611 --> 00:51:03,173
I need you to pull the handbrake hard.

982
00:51:05,614 --> 00:51:06,505
Pull it.

983
00:51:06,669 --> 00:51:08,348
<i>No, no.</i>

984
00:51:19,856 --> 00:51:20,749
Emily?

985
00:51:20,841 --> 00:51:23,593
<i>This is Emily LIGHTON.
I can't come to the phone right now.</i>

986
00:51:23,677 --> 00:51:24,637
<i>So…</i>

987
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:31,074
-Emily?
<i>-Yeah, I crashed my bike…</i>

988
00:51:31,158 --> 00:51:32,145
-What?
<i>-My knee.</i>

989
00:51:32,301 --> 00:51:35,223
-I can't talk right now. Call back later.
<i>-Hello?</i>

990
00:51:38,585 --> 00:51:39,662
-Emily.
<i>-Hello?</i>

991
00:51:39,746 --> 00:51:42,281
<i>-I crashed my bike and hurt my knee.</i>
-Sir, I'm sorry.

992
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:44,501
-Like I said, I can't talk right now.
<i>-What was that?</i>

993
00:51:44,585 --> 00:51:45,445
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

994
00:51:45,529 --> 00:51:47,313
When you call, you get the same operator.

995
00:51:47,397 --> 00:51:48,967
So, I, just please call back later.

996
00:51:49,051 --> 00:51:50,031
<i>Excuse me?</i>

997
00:51:50,115 --> 00:51:52,331
<i>-Just send an ambulance.</i>
-What for your knee?

998
00:51:52,415 --> 00:51:53,250
<i>Yeah?</i>

999
00:51:53,334 --> 00:51:56,336
Call an Uber and don't bike drunk asshole.

1000
00:52:00,852 --> 00:52:01,688
Emily.

1001
00:52:01,772 --> 00:52:05,215
<i>I did the thing you said
but it didn't work. I can't get out.</i>

1002
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,555
Okay, I know. Okay. You're headed toward,
you're headed toward San Bernardino.

1003
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:11,300
-Did you know where?
<i>-I can't see anything.</i>

1004
00:52:12,236 --> 00:52:13,921
<i>I don't know.
I don't wanna get locked up.</i>

1005
00:52:14,012 --> 00:52:16,645
No. But where are you going?
I'll get you out of the car.

1006
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:21,500
-Emily.
<i>-I'm going to die. I'm going to die.</i>

1007
00:52:21,584 --> 00:52:23,606
No. Nobody's gonna die.
Nobody's gonna die.

1008
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:25,278
I have to put you on hold, okay?

1009
00:52:25,362 --> 00:52:26,727
Please just help my kids.

1010
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:29,591
Emily, if I'm gonna help you,
hold, just hold the line.

1011
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,122
I'll be right back.

1012
00:52:35,005 --> 00:52:38,153
<i>-LAPD communications, Sergeant Miller.</i>
-It's Joe.

1013
00:52:38,482 --> 00:52:39,926
<i>Joe, what? You're still at work?</i>

1014
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:41,474
Oh shit, Bill.

1015
00:52:41,652 --> 00:52:44,514
No, I didn't, I didn't mean to call you.
I am gonna call CHP. Sorry.

1016
00:52:44,598 --> 00:52:47,082
-No, I know, I can't. I can't right now.
<i>-What the fuck, Joe!</i>

1017
00:52:49,835 --> 00:52:51,465
<i>-California Highway Patrol.</i>
-It's Joe.

1018
00:52:52,535 --> 00:52:54,390
Listen, I have Emily
on the other line. Okay?

1019
00:52:54,474 --> 00:52:55,811
She's in the back of the van.

1020
00:52:55,895 --> 00:52:58,105
It looks like they're headed somewhere--

1021
00:52:58,488 --> 00:53:01,455
somewhere near the 10th and the 210th
towards San Bernardino.

1022
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:04,007
<i>-No, I need a better location.</i>
-Shit. Shit.

1023
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:07,270
Fuck shit. They just switched,
switched cell, cell towers, just, just,

1024
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:09,408
-I have her on the other line.
<i>-I told you I had,</i>

1025
00:53:09,492 --> 00:53:11,593
<i>-I need a better location.</i>
-I'll get it. I'll get it.

1026
00:53:11,677 --> 00:53:14,048
Just send units up to 210th from the 10th.

1027
00:53:14,132 --> 00:53:16,132
<i>-How will you get it?</i>
-I'll get her out of the car.

1028
00:53:18,413 --> 00:53:20,017
-Emily?
<i>-Oh God, please, don't hang up.</i>

1029
00:53:20,101 --> 00:53:21,155
Emily, I'm back.

1030
00:53:22,124 --> 00:53:23,335
<i>Please don't hang up.</i>

1031
00:53:23,419 --> 00:53:24,562
I won't.

1032
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,273
<i>I just wanna go home to my kids.</i>

1033
00:53:28,357 --> 00:53:30,359
All right. Now just listen.

1034
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:33,903
<i>He put me in the back
of the van and I can't see anything.</i>

1035
00:53:33,987 --> 00:53:37,400
-No. Emily, Emily, listen to me.
<i>-I don't know why he's doing this?</i>

1036
00:53:37,754 --> 00:53:39,165
Just listen to my voice, Emily.

1037
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,420
All right? I'm with you.

1038
00:53:40,504 --> 00:53:42,729
<i>-He's gonna lock me up.</i>
-You're not alone. All right?

1039
00:53:42,813 --> 00:53:43,964
Do you understand?

1040
00:53:44,543 --> 00:53:46,464
<i>I don't know. I don't wanna die.</i>

1041
00:53:47,754 --> 00:53:49,035
Okay, just…

1042
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:52,366
What does Henry do?

1043
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:54,277
What, what, why does Henry have a van?

1044
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:55,780
<i>-I'm gonna die.</i>
-No, no, you're not.

1045
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:56,915
No, you're not.

1046
00:53:56,999 --> 00:54:00,392
-Emily, Emily, take a deep breath.
<i>-I'm gonna die.</i>

1047
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:03,361
Now, I'm gonna get you back to Abby,

1048
00:54:03,722 --> 00:54:05,043
but I need your help. All right?

1049
00:54:05,127 --> 00:54:07,679
I'm gonna need you to go
find something in the back of the van

1050
00:54:07,763 --> 00:54:09,203
to defend yourself with.

1051
00:54:09,572 --> 00:54:12,330
-Is there anything back there?
<i>-I can't see anything.</i>

1052
00:54:12,414 --> 00:54:15,525
Just feel around.
Use the flashlight on your phone.

1053
00:54:17,923 --> 00:54:19,374
<i>Ah, there's a cardboard box.</i>

1054
00:54:19,874 --> 00:54:21,994
<i>Heavy. Heavy box.</i>

1055
00:54:23,023 --> 00:54:25,180
<i>-Bricks. Bricks.</i>
-Okay, okay, good.

1056
00:54:25,264 --> 00:54:27,264
Good. Okay. Can you pick one up?

1057
00:54:29,795 --> 00:54:31,631
<i>I can only have one. I have one.</i>

1058
00:54:31,715 --> 00:54:33,816
Good. Okay, good. Okay.

1059
00:54:35,014 --> 00:54:36,587
Now listen, Emily.

1060
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:38,388
When he stops the van

1061
00:54:39,169 --> 00:54:40,606
and he opens those doors

1062
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:44,587
I want you to hit him
in the head as hard as you can.

1063
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:45,986
Do you understand?

1064
00:54:46,557 --> 00:54:48,501
<i>-I can't do that. I can't do that.</i>
-You can.

1065
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:49,488
Emily?

1066
00:54:49,925 --> 00:54:51,056
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1067
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:52,316
Emily? Yes, you can.

1068
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,657
Then you take his knife
and then you tell me where you are

1069
00:54:55,853 --> 00:54:57,165
and I will send help.

1070
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,189
<i>I can't.</i>

1071
00:54:58,859 --> 00:55:00,124
Yes, you can. Emily,

1072
00:55:00,618 --> 00:55:01,605
Emily.

1073
00:55:03,402 --> 00:55:05,913
Emily, Emily, breathe.

1074
00:55:06,806 --> 00:55:09,265
Emily, breathe, come on, come on now.

1075
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,050
-Come on, come on, come on.
<i>-I'm gonna die.</i>

1076

Just like this. Just like this.

1077
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:17,220
Come on, just like, come on, Emily.

1078
00:55:17,765 --> 00:55:18,635
Emily.

1079
00:55:18,924 --> 00:55:20,730
<i>I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die.</i>

1080
00:55:20,814 --> 00:55:22,119
You're not.

1081
00:55:22,331 --> 00:55:24,330
Emily. Breathe with me.

1082
00:55:34,077 --> 00:55:37,178
Breathe, breathe Emily.
Breathe with me. Breathe with me.

1083
00:55:45,677 --> 00:55:47,936
And Emily, what, what's your favorite…

1084
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:49,894
What's your favorite food?

1085
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:55,120
Emily, what, what's your favorite food?

1086
00:55:55,847 --> 00:55:56,683
<i>Cherry.</i>

1087
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:59,003
<i>Cherry Slurpees.</i>

1088
00:56:01,197 --> 00:56:05,017
Cherry Slurpees,
I don't know if that's a, uh, food.

1089
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,174
What do you…

1090
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,321
What do you like to do with your kids?
Huh? What's the nice thing?

1091
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,856
Keep breathing,
keep breathing with me. All right?

1092
00:56:14,093 --> 00:56:16,765
What's-- what's-- what--
what do you like to do in your free time?

1093
00:56:19,219 --> 00:56:23,789
<i>I like to be with Abby,

No. What do you do with your kids, Emily?
Come on. What's a nice thing you do?

1095
00:56:28,645 --> 00:56:30,023
Come on, what's…

<i>We like the aquarium.</i>

Where?

1099
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:49,817
<i>In San Pedro, have you been there?</i>

1100
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:55,822
No, I've always meant to
take my daughter there,

1101
00:56:56,448 --> 00:56:57,829
but we never had a chance to.

1102
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:00,620
Tell me, tell me about the aquarium.

1103
00:57:00,704 --> 00:57:02,531
What is in… Is it nice?

1104
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:08,900
<i>Abby likes the turtles,</i>

1105
00:57:09,938 --> 00:57:12,744
<i>she doesn't even look at the sharks.</i>

1106
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,340
Well, what do you-- what do you like?
You like the sharks?

1107
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:21,751
<i>I like all of them.</i>

1108
00:57:21,858 --> 00:57:22,881
<i>I…</i>

1109
00:57:23,427 --> 00:57:28,279
<i>I usually walk behind Abby
with Oliver in the baby carriage.</i>

1110
00:57:30,218 --> 00:57:32,404
<i>And then I just look.</i>

1111
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:34,538
<i>And feel.</i>

1112
00:57:37,007 --> 00:57:38,225
Feel what?

1113
00:57:41,366 --> 00:57:43,288
<i>It seems so peaceful.</i>

1114
00:57:47,315 --> 00:57:48,412
What does?

1115
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:53,779
<i>Under the water like…</i>

1116
00:57:55,803 --> 00:57:57,217
<i>Like quiet.</i>

1117
00:57:58,007 --> 00:57:59,757
<i>Like being held.</i>

1118
00:58:02,132 --> 00:58:03,341
<i>No distractions.</i>

1119
00:58:03,425 --> 00:58:07,584
<i>It's just water flowing around you.</i>

1120
00:58:08,858 --> 00:58:10,429
<i>Very quiet.</i>

1121
00:58:11,452 --> 00:58:16,178
<i>Like a big blue silence.</i>

1122
00:58:18,936 --> 00:58:19,944
Yeah.

1123
00:58:26,345 --> 00:58:28,350
<i>I forgot your name.</i>

1124
00:58:30,147 --> 00:58:32,327
My name is Joe.

1125
00:58:36,365 --> 00:58:37,764
<i>I like you, Joe.</i>

1126
00:58:40,615 --> 00:58:42,045
I like you too, Emily.

1127
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,444
<i>Would you like to come with us?</i>

1128
00:58:49,015 --> 00:58:50,116
I'd love to.

1129
00:58:57,836 --> 00:58:59,107
<i>He's stopping.</i>

1130
00:59:01,897 --> 00:59:03,546
<i>I am scared.</i>

1131
00:59:04,445 --> 00:59:06,945
Okay. All right. Now, take it easy, Emily.

1132
00:59:07,205 --> 00:59:08,741
-Just…
<i>-I'm scared.</i>

1133
00:59:08,825 --> 00:59:11,281
-Put your phone in your pocket.
<i>-I am scared.</i>

1134
00:59:11,395 --> 00:59:12,821
And when he opens those doors.

1135
00:59:12,951 --> 00:59:16,284
You take that brick and you hit him
in the head as hard as you can.

1136
00:59:16,368 --> 00:59:17,529
He deserves it.

1137
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,560
<i>-He deserves it.</i>
-That's right.

1138
00:59:23,107 --> 00:59:26,308
Now, put your phone away,
put it in your pocket.

1139
00:59:26,392 --> 00:59:29,051
<i>He was so angry.</i>

1140
00:59:29,135 --> 00:59:32,197
-I know, I know.
<i>-He was so angry.</i>

1141
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:34,494
Emily put the phone away.

1142
00:59:34,578 --> 00:59:36,579
<i>-Oliver's fine.</i>
-Just put…

1143
00:59:36,663 --> 00:59:39,157
-Put the phone away when he opens.
<i>-Oliver is fine.</i>

1144
00:59:39,241 --> 00:59:41,279
<i>He isn't even crying now.</i>

1145
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,170
What was that?

1146
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:48,779
<i>The snakes.</i>

1147
00:59:49,145 --> 00:59:50,529
<i>Snakes? What snakes?</i>

1148
00:59:52,535 --> 00:59:55,130
<i>He was in so much pain…</i>

1149
00:59:57,615 --> 00:59:58,717
<i>in his stomach,</i>

1150
00:59:58,884 --> 01:00:02,378
He kept crying
because he had snakes in his stomach.

1151
01:00:04,732 --> 01:00:06,717
<i>And I just took them out.</i>

1152
01:00:11,466 --> 01:00:13,341
<i>I just took-- took them out.</i>

1153
01:00:18,561 --> 01:00:20,217
Was it you?

1154
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:28,256
<i>He's not crying anymore.
He's so much better.</i>

1155
01:00:30,716 --> 01:00:32,998
<i>He's fine. Isn't he, Joe?</i>

1156
01:00:34,522 --> 01:00:38,131
<i>Joe, please tell me he's fine.</i>

1157
01:00:39,499 --> 01:00:41,561
<i>Please just tell me, Joe.</i>

1158
01:00:42,186 --> 01:00:44,085
<i>-Hey, hey.
-Please, don't lock me up.</i>

1159
01:00:45,077 --> 01:00:46,326
<i>Get away from me!</i>

1160
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:49,264
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

1161
01:00:50,217 --> 01:00:51,077
<i>Hey!</i>

1162
01:00:51,483 --> 01:00:52,678
<i>Stop it!</i>

1163
01:01:11,165 --> 01:01:12,053
<i>Hello?</i>

1164
01:01:13,235 --> 01:01:14,615
<i>Hello? Are you there, Joe?</i>

1165
01:01:16,031 --> 01:01:18,265
<i>I think there's something wrong
with my phone. Hang on.</i>

1166
01:01:18,935 --> 01:01:20,000
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1167
01:01:20,482 --> 01:01:21,450
Yeah.

1168
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:25,315
<i>I think I found something.</i>

1169
01:01:25,927 --> 01:01:27,759
<i>They went to court over custody.</i>

1170
01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:31,302
<i>Henry has a lot of letters from a lawyer.
It looks like he lost visitation rights.</i>

1171
01:01:31,386 --> 01:01:34,386
<i>It's about his criminal record
and his sentences for assaulting them.</i>

1172
01:01:34,503 --> 01:01:35,714
<i>No fucking wonder.</i>

1173
01:01:38,082 --> 01:01:39,026
<i>Joe?</i>

1174
01:01:42,518 --> 01:01:43,440
<i>Joe?</i>

1175
01:01:44,683 --> 01:01:45,596
Yeah.

1176
01:01:46,201 --> 01:01:47,128
Yeah.

1177
01:01:48,784 --> 01:01:50,775
<i>Sorry, I'll get to the point.</i>

1178
01:01:50,859 --> 01:01:52,233
<i>The only thing
from San Bernardino</i>

1179
01:01:52,317 --> 01:01:54,836
<i>are some unpaid bills
from Patton State Hospital.</i>

1180
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,242
<i>She was a patient there.</i>

1181
01:02:01,955 --> 01:02:02,811
<i>Joe?</i>

1182
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:06,565
<i>Patton State Psychiatric Treatment Center.</i>

1183
01:02:06,649 --> 01:02:07,490
<i>Does that help any?</i>

1184
01:02:08,863 --> 01:02:10,625
She doesn't wanna be locked up.

1185
01:02:12,541 --> 01:02:13,572
<i>What was that?</i>

1186
01:02:14,371 --> 01:02:16,175
She doesn't wanna be locked up.

1187
01:02:17,495 --> 01:02:19,495
<i>-You lost me there, brother.</i>
-Shit.

1188
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,012
<i>Joe?</i>

1189
01:02:45,339 --> 01:02:47,472
PATTON STATE PSYCHIATRIC CENTER

1190
01:02:50,292 --> 01:02:51,238
Henry?

1191
01:02:51,322 --> 01:02:52,302
<i>Hello.</i>

1192
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:53,870
Joe, from LAPD.

1193
01:02:53,954 --> 01:02:56,807
Are you at, are you
at Patton State Hospital?

1194
01:02:56,891 --> 01:02:58,003
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1195
01:02:58,580 --> 01:02:59,721
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

1196
01:03:03,436 --> 01:03:05,774
Okay. Uh, where's Emily.

1197
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,654
<i>I don't know.</i>

1198
01:03:09,738 --> 01:03:11,014
<i>She hit me.</i>

1199
01:03:11,428 --> 01:03:12,306
Okay, I'll send help.

1200
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:14,196
-Do you need an ambulance?
<i>-No.</i>

1201
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,584
<i>-Oh no, no, please.</i>
-No, I…

1202
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:18,451
-Henry, I have to, I have to.
<i>-No, please.</i>

1203
01:03:18,535 --> 01:03:21,132
-I have to.
<i>-I've been telling you not to, man. No.</i>

1204
01:03:21,953 --> 01:03:23,272
I know, I know.

1205
01:03:26,334 --> 01:03:29,948
Why didn't you just tell me?
You should've just called the police

1206
01:03:30,032 --> 01:03:32,132
and let us take care of Emily.

1207
01:03:33,506 --> 01:03:35,170
<i>-Why?</i>
-I want to help her.

1208
01:03:35,374 --> 01:03:37,397
<i>Huh? Now, you wanna help her?</i>

1209
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:39,428
Yes. That is my job.

1210
01:03:40,623 --> 01:03:42,636
<i>I tell you something, nobody helps.</i>

1211
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:45,486
<i>You get doctors,
lawyers, social workers, nobody helps.</i>

1212
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:47,702
<i>Just fucking nobody.</i>

1213
01:03:47,835 --> 01:03:49,928
<i>And you gonna tell me
that cops can help me?</i>

1214
01:03:50,645 --> 01:03:51,928
I'm trying to help.

01:03:53,835 --> 01:03:57,991
<i>Fuck you, fuck you.</i>

1216

<i>It's my son.</i>

1217

<i>My son is dead.</i>

1219
01:04:24,929 --> 01:04:27,303
<i>Last November, you know,</i>

1220
01:04:27,937 --> 01:04:29,124
<i>we--</i>

1221
01:04:30,771 --> 01:04:32,309
<i>Discount ran out, man.</i>

1222
01:04:34,274 --> 01:04:37,370
<i>We said we'll try and then we tried
to do without her meds.</i>

1223
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:39,020
<i>Oh my God. Oh my God.</i>

1224
01:04:41,038 --> 01:04:44,788
<i>I couldn't-- Because I couldn't pay
for the, you know-- like--</i>

1225
01:04:45,082 --> 01:04:47,241
<i>Cause I-- Oh my God.</i>

1226
01:04:49,764 --> 01:04:53,163
Henry, what are you doing?

1227
01:04:55,452 --> 01:04:56,733
<i>Oh my God, Abby.</i>

1228
01:04:56,921 --> 01:04:58,657
<i>I should have never left her.</i>

1229
01:04:58,741 --> 01:05:01,663
No, no, Henry, the police are with her.

1230
01:05:02,075 --> 01:05:07,934
Henry, Henry, I'm going to need you
to try and calm down.

1231
01:05:09,247 --> 01:05:11,804
<i>And she's a little baby.
It's a little baby girl.</i>

1232
01:05:11,888 --> 01:05:13,848
<i>I told her not to go in there.</i>

1233
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:16,434
<i>Oh my God, I need to get Abby.</i>

1234
01:05:16,655 --> 01:05:18,262
Henry Henry.

1235
01:05:18,346 --> 01:05:21,365
Listen to me, Henry,
the police have her, the police.

1236
01:05:21,449 --> 01:05:23,009
She is safe. She is safe.

1237
01:05:23,225 --> 01:05:24,348
She is fine.

1238
01:05:24,614 --> 01:05:27,281
She is fine. Where is Emily?

1239
01:05:27,513 --> 01:05:28,962
We have to find Emily.

1240
01:05:29,621 --> 01:05:31,887
-Henry, Henry.
<i>-I don't know where she is.</i>

1241
01:05:33,184 --> 01:05:35,473
Henry, do you think that
she could harm herself?

1242
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:37,436
<i>I don't know. I don't know.</i>

1243
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:42,126
<i>Listen, just, listen.
Listen to me, okay? Listen.</i>

1244
01:05:43,048 --> 01:05:46,809
<i>She has no idea what she's done, man.</i>

1245
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:53,415
<i>She thinks… Oh my God,
she thinks that she helped Oliver.</i>

1246
01:05:54,253 --> 01:05:57,926
<i>I didn't have the heart to tell her
that she was-- oh, God.</i>

1247
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:02,299
<i>She wasn't always like this,
she's just sick.</i>

1248
01:06:03,885 --> 01:06:08,408
<i>I just, well, I needed to help her, Jesus.</i>

1249
01:06:09,588 --> 01:06:10,698
Henry?

1250
01:06:23,921 --> 01:06:27,460
<i>This is Emily LIGHTON. I can't
come to the phone right now. So…</i>

1251
01:06:46,504 --> 01:06:47,584
Joe.

1252
01:06:49,027 --> 01:06:50,080
Joe.

1253
01:06:52,156 --> 01:06:54,609
We have a caller who wants to talk to you.

1254
01:06:54,693 --> 01:06:55,544
What?

1255
01:06:55,628 --> 01:06:57,314
We have a caller who wants to talk to you.

1256
01:06:57,398 --> 01:06:59,405
She says, you've talked before.
Her name is Emily.

1257
01:06:59,489 --> 01:07:03,926
No. What? Just where is she?
Just now, now, man, now!

1258
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:05,276
What happened here?

1259
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,670
-Just put her through.
-I'll patch her through.

1260
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:14,820
Emily.

1261
01:07:15,485 --> 01:07:16,736
<i>Is that you, Joe?</i>

1262
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:18,328
Yes. Emily, I'm here.

1263
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,242
Where are you?

1264
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:27,195
<i>I'm gonna go find Oliver and Abby.</i>

1265
01:07:28,191 --> 01:07:30,390
<i>I'm gonna take them to the aquarium.</i>

1266
01:07:30,672 --> 01:07:32,677
No, no.

1267
01:07:32,768 --> 01:07:35,892
-No, Emily, no.
<i>-I'm gonna show you the turtles.</i>

1268
01:07:38,057 --> 01:07:39,611
<i>Oliver loves the turtles.</i>

1269
01:07:39,695 --> 01:07:41,103
No, you're not gonna…

1270
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:44,111
You're not gonna find Oliver.

1271
01:07:45,432 --> 01:07:46,729
Oliver is not there.

1272
01:07:47,158 --> 01:07:48,908
Emily, Emily, I need you…

1273
01:07:49,947 --> 01:07:51,116
<i>He is better now.</i>

1274
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,684
Emily, I need you to look around you.
Okay? Where are you?

1275
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:55,680
Where are you? I hear cars.

1276
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:58,015
Can you see what's around you?

1277
01:08:00,893 --> 01:08:01,924
<i>I…</i>

1278
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:05,470
<i>I see, I see…</i>

1279
01:08:05,557 --> 01:08:06,612
What?

1280
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:07,994
Emily.

1281
01:08:11,534 --> 01:08:12,783
<i>What is this?</i>

1282
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:19,242
<i>I have blood on my hands
and on my shirt.</i>

1283
01:08:19,326 --> 01:08:20,728
Emily.

1284
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:22,604
<i>Where?</i>

1285
01:08:22,736 --> 01:08:24,710
<i>-I got blood on my hands.</i>
-Emily, Emily. Okay.

1286
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:27,173
Okay. Emily, listen to me,
Emily, listen to me.

1287
01:08:27,257 --> 01:08:28,166
<i>I have blood on me.</i>

1288
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:30,415
-Listen to me. It's okay.
<i>-Oh God, where is this from?</i>

1289
01:08:30,499 --> 01:08:32,797
It's not yours. Okay. Just look up. Okay?

1290
01:08:32,881 --> 01:08:34,496
Look up and tell me where you are.

1291
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:36,556
What… what can you see? I hear cars.

1292
01:08:37,665 --> 01:08:39,087
Is that, is that right?

1293
01:08:39,545 --> 01:08:41,361
Are there cars nearby?

1294
01:08:43,576 --> 01:08:45,213
<i>Way down below.</i>

1295
01:08:46,565 --> 01:08:48,275
What? The cars are?

1296
01:08:51,704 --> 01:08:52,870
Emily? Are you on a freeway?

1297
01:08:52,954 --> 01:08:56,289
Are you-- are you--
are you on an overpass?

1298
01:08:58,938 --> 01:09:00,118
<i>Joe.</i>

1299
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:03,971
-Emily.
<i>-Joe, is it Henry's blood?</i>

1300
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:07,300
<i>Joe, is this Henry's blood?</i>

1301
01:09:11,975 --> 01:09:13,541
No, Henry's okay.

1302
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:14,780
<i>This isn't…</i>

1303
01:09:16,038 --> 01:09:20,468
<i>I know this isn't my blood.
Joe, whose blood is this?</i>

1304
01:09:20,552 --> 01:09:22,007
No. Emily, Em…

1305
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:23,606
<i>Whose blood is this?</i>

1306
01:09:24,302 --> 01:09:26,006
<i>-Whose blood is this?</i>
-Emily, Emily.

1307
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:28,925
Just tell me where you are
so I can send someone to help you.

1308
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:31,183
<i>-This isn't my blood.</i>
-Emily, tell me where you…

1309
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:33,037
-Just tell me where you are.
<i>-What did I do?</i>

1310
01:09:33,121 --> 01:09:35,331
-Please, please listen to me.
<i>-Oh, what did I do, Joe?</i>

1311
01:09:35,415 --> 01:09:36,980
Emily, please.

1312
01:09:37,064 --> 01:09:40,668
<i>No. This is Henry's blood.</i>

1313
01:09:40,916 --> 01:09:42,447
<i>This is Henry's.</i>

1314
01:09:46,681 --> 01:09:49,048
Hey, call CHP Dispatch now.

1315
01:09:49,978 --> 01:09:51,509
I know, Henry knows.

1316
01:09:51,734 --> 01:09:53,359
Henry knows.

1317
01:09:54,268 --> 01:09:55,432
Tell them it's Joe.

1318
01:09:55,588 --> 01:09:58,306
Tell them I have the abducted woman
on the 210 overpass.

1319
01:09:58,390 --> 01:09:59,658
Dispatch, now.

1320
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:01,025
Now!

1321
01:10:01,588 --> 01:10:04,783
Emily. I'm here. I'm here.
I know, I know.

1322
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:07,126
-I know.
<i>-Tell them I didn't mean it, Joe.</i>

1323
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:08,665
No, Henry knows. Henry knows.

1324
01:10:08,749 --> 01:10:10,616
He was just,
he was just trying to help you.

1325
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:12,796
And we were all just trying to help you.

1326
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,184
We're all just trying to help you.
Just, just…

1327
01:10:15,268 --> 01:10:18,607
<i>Why did you…
You said that he deserved it, Joe.</i>

1328
01:10:25,031 --> 01:10:26,439
I was-- I was wrong.

1329
01:10:28,526 --> 01:10:29,828
It's my-- it's my fault.

1330
01:10:30,215 --> 01:10:31,205
It's my fault, Emily.

1331
01:10:31,289 --> 01:10:34,259
It's my fault that you you're-
you're on the overpass. Okay?

1332
01:10:34,343 --> 01:10:37,382
Just please, please don't do
anything stupid.

1333
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:38,735
Do you understand?

1334
01:10:39,226 --> 01:10:40,359
Please.

1335
01:10:41,178 --> 01:10:42,834
There are people who love you.

1336
01:10:44,546 --> 01:10:46,772
Okay? Abby-- Abby loves you.

1337
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:50,874
Abby needs you.

1338
01:10:53,413 --> 01:10:56,241
Abby is waiting for you to come home.

1339
01:10:56,445 --> 01:10:59,426
Just please, Emily, please,
just talk to me.

1340
01:11:00,575 --> 01:11:03,013
-Talk to me.
<i>-I'm gonna go now.</i>

1341
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:05,942
<i>-I'm gonna go be with Oliver.</i>
-No.

1342
01:11:06,169 --> 01:11:08,590
<i>Joe, I'm gonna go be with Oliver.</i>

1343
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,340
I killed a man.

1344
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:13,582
Do you hear me? I kill-- I killed a man.

1345
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:22,653
Do you hear me?

1346
01:11:23,749 --> 01:11:25,140
I killed a man,

1347
01:11:25,718 --> 01:11:27,178
A boy, actually.

1348
01:11:28,561 --> 01:11:32,162
Nineteen years old, Joseph.
Still-- still-- still a boy.

1349
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:35,530
<i>No, what? Why?</i>

1350
01:11:35,785 --> 01:11:38,410
I don't know. I don't know.

1351
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:42,319
Because I-- because I could.
I just wanted to punish him.

1352
01:11:42,491 --> 01:11:45,134
I wanted to punish him
because I was angry.

1353
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:49,014
I'm just so, I'm so angry and I, I…

1354
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:53,490
Just, he-- he did something.
He hurt-- he hurt someone.

1355
01:11:56,824 --> 01:11:59,461
He didn't hurt. Did he hurt someone?

1356
01:11:59,545 --> 01:12:03,480
Um, he--
I don't know if he hurt someone.

1357
01:12:03,695 --> 01:12:04,865
Please, please.

1358
01:12:05,545 --> 01:12:09,435
But my-- my dad.

1359
01:12:13,975 --> 01:12:17,506
Just, please, I can't--
I can't kill you too, Emily.

1360
01:12:19,625 --> 01:12:22,554
I can't kill you too.

1361
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,078
<i>Joe.</i>

1362
01:12:27,171 --> 01:12:29,227
<i>No, why? Why?</i>

1363
01:12:30,275 --> 01:12:31,631
<i>Was it snakes?</i>

1364
01:12:38,095 --> 01:12:39,010
Yeah.

1365
01:12:43,182 --> 01:12:44,446
Yes, it was snakes.

1366
01:12:51,318 --> 01:12:52,483
Just…

1367
01:12:53,295 --> 01:12:58,880
I promised Abby that you will come home.

1368
01:13:01,715 --> 01:13:03,821
I promised her that you would come home.

1369
01:13:04,123 --> 01:13:05,373
She needs you.

1370
01:13:05,584 --> 01:13:06,615
<i>Abby.</i>

1371
01:13:08,928 --> 01:13:10,053
<i>Abby.</i>

1372
01:13:11,326 --> 01:13:12,295
Yes.

1373
01:13:13,175 --> 01:13:17,143
Please, I promised her. And so does Henry.

1374
01:13:17,846 --> 01:13:20,487
You have people who love you.

1375
01:13:26,563 --> 01:13:28,516
Please. Please.

1376
01:13:30,828 --> 01:13:32,273
Please, Emily.

1377
01:13:37,248 --> 01:13:40,071
<i>Joe, Joe.</i>

1378
01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:42,633
Yes?

1379
01:13:47,532 --> 01:13:49,376
<i>I see the lights.</i>

1380
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:50,884
Okay, Emily.

1381
01:13:51,813 --> 01:13:55,250
Just go over to the officers.

1382
01:13:55,850 --> 01:13:57,880
<i>I'm gonna go now.</i>

1383
01:13:58,892 --> 01:14:01,228
Just go over to the officers.

1384
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:03,408
<i>I'm gonna go be with Oliver, Joe.</i>

1385
01:14:06,332 --> 01:14:07,251
Emily.

1386
01:14:12,016 --> 01:14:15,464
<i>This is Emily LIGHTON.
I can't come to the phone right now. So…</i>

1387
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:17,626
<i>Stop it.</i>

1388
01:14:17,917 --> 01:14:21,618
<i>Leave me a message.
Call later or send a text. Bye.</i>

<i>This is Emily LIGHTON.
I can't come to the phone right now. So…</i>

1390
01:14:29,618 --> 01:14:30,587
<i>Stop it.</i>

1391
01:14:31,064 --> 01:14:32,564
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

1392
01:14:37,287 --> 01:14:39,287
<i>-California Highway Patrol.</i>
-It's Joe.

1393
01:14:41,937 --> 01:14:44,295
<i>We have her, she came down.</i>

1394
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:48,142
Whoa, wait, y-y-you…

1395
01:14:48,226 --> 01:14:50,547
Uh huh, we have her.

1396
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:54,566
<i>I'm on with the officers now.
She came down off the overpass.</i>

<i>We got her.</i>

1398
01:14:59,073 --> 01:15:00,196
<i>Good job, Baylor.</i>

1399
01:15:26,404 --> 01:15:30,083
Oh, you got a message from Tim Gervasi,

1400
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:31,714
Who?

1401
01:15:31,798 --> 01:15:33,793
The officer who went to the LIGHTON home.

1402
01:15:33,877 --> 01:15:36,619
He wanted you to know that the baby
is in the ICU at St. Helens.

1403
01:15:39,049 --> 01:15:40,197
Sorry, what?

1404
01:15:41,164 --> 01:15:44,187
The baby is in the ICU at St. Helens.

1405
01:15:44,296 --> 01:15:45,265
Oliver?

1406
01:15:45,349 --> 01:15:46,890
Yeah, I guess.

1407
01:15:48,271 --> 01:15:49,513
He's alive?

1408
01:15:49,976 --> 01:15:50,856
Yeah.

1409
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:56,544
