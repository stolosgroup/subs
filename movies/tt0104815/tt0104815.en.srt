1
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,899
<i>Good morning, Azul.</i>

2
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,098
Know who this is?

3
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,910
Moco.

4
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,980
What the hell do you want
after all these years?

5
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,310
<i>I'm a few towns away...</i>

6
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,714
...with a whole new gang.

7
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,386
I heard you were nearby...

8
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,252
...so I decided to give you a call, amigo.

9
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,584
That's very sweet of you...

10
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:49,785
...asshole.

11
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,889
Suppose you get me out of here
and give me my share of the money.

12
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:58,432
Seeing how I got you
where you are today.

13
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,436
Do you really want to get out?

14
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,269
<i>I hear you're running</i>
<i>quite a business...</i>

15
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,310
<i>... from your cell...</i>

16
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,176
<i>... with only a phone</i>
<i>and a few loyal men.</i>

17
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,612
That's not a bad idea.

18
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,751
<i>Someday I'll try it.</i>

19
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,252
In here I'll earn peanuts...

20
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,187
...compared to what you owe me
when I get out.

21
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,851
So, yes, help me...

22
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,527
...amigo.

23
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:27,689
Soon, Azul, soon.

24
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:31,565
<i>I'm sending some friends to get you...</i>

25
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,036
...in a few days.

26
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,637
That's more like it.

27
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,474
Just like the Moco I used to know.

28
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,374
Hang in there.

29
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:51,714
<i>I won't forget you've been</i>
<i>a big part of our triumph.</i>

30
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,890
What's going on, Moco?

31
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,395
Getting me out today?

32
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,876
There are three armed men!

33
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,282
Did you send them?

34
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,704
I'm still here, Moco,
and so are your little friends.

35
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,906
But not for long.

36
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,941
They have something
they want to scream to you.

37
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,611
Listen close.

38
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:56,975
You'll repeat it to me
when I visit you.

39
00:09:55,294 --> 00:10:00,095
<i>That morning was just like any other.</i>

40
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,733
<i>No love.</i>

41
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,460
<i>No luck.</i>

42
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,974
<i>No ride.</i>

43
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,303
<i>Nothing changes.</i>

44
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,686
<i>I came across a turtle...</i>

45
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:29,127
<i>... walking on the highway.</i>

46
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:41,068
<i>We were both taking our time</i>
<i>getting to where we were going.</i>

47
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,466
<i>What I didn't know...</i>

48
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,703
<i>... was that my time...</i>

49
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,870
<i>... was running out.</i>

50
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,715
ICE COLD COCONUT JUICE

51
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,394
I'll have a coconut.

52
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,481
<i>WELCO ME TO ACUׁA-CO AHUILA</i>
<i>LAND OF FRIENDSHIP</i>

53
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,212
<i>Free coconuts.</i>

54
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,983
<i>I was beginning to like this city.</i>

55
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:52,604
<i>I've always wanted to be a mariachi...</i>

56
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,837
<i>... like my father, my grandfather...</i>

57
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,541
<i>... and my great-grandfather.</i>

58
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,210
<i>I'm not as good as them yet...</i>

59
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,879
<i>... but I'm improving.</i>

60
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:08,287
<i>My plan was to follow their footsteps</i>
<i>to the end...</i>

61
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,760
<i>... and die with my guitar in my hand.</i>

62
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,824
<i>I played from town to town...</i>

63
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,833
<i>... gaining different experiences.</i>

64
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:29,404
<i>This city was my next stop.</i>

65
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,919
<i>The free coconut at the edge of town...</i>

66
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:38,318
<i>... made me feel like this city</i>
<i>would bring good luck.</i>

67
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,324
<i>But I was completely wrong.</i>

68
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,013
- What do you want?
- A soda pop.

69
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,531
Music?

70
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,907
- Why?
- I'm a mariachi, and a good one.

71
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,680
I play ballads, love songs...

72
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:42,411
...old songs, new songs
and a few originals.

73
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:43,714
What do I care?

74
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,491
I could add more style,
more class to the place.

75
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,561
I work for almost nothing.

76
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,425
I live mostly from tips.

77
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:57,033
But I need steady work...

78
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,468
...and I guarantee more customers.

79
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,103
Why would I want one mariachi...

80
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:07,040
...when I already have a full band?

81
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,001
You see?

82
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:12,633
I only pay one guy and I have
a whole group of mariachis.

83
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,642
Understand?

84
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,476
Thanks.

85
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:30,853
If you want to earn a real living,
get a real instrument...

86
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,754
...asshole.

87
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,705
I gotta go.

88
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:52,316
- Come on.
- I'll be right back.

89
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,198
What the hell is this?

90
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,800
Mariachi Day?

91
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:13,266
There's no work for you either!

92
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:25,679
Bartender, a beer.

93
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,929
In a bottle, stupid.

94
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:56,042
I'm looking for an old friend.

95
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,280
His name is Moco.

96
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:03,048
- Where is he?
- Sometimes he's here.

97
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,581
He owns the place.

98
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,295
- So you know him?
- There you go.

99
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,556
Of course. We work for him.

100
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,524
That's too bad.

101
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,927
Hold that.

102
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,346
<i>What the hell is going on there?</i>

103
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,652
- Answer me!
- Moco!

104
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,901
Give me the telephone.

105
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:40,876
Take it.

106
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,451
Dead?

107
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,523
All of them? How long ago?

108
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,896
What does he look like?

109
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,373
Carrying a guitar case?

110
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,206
Dressed in black.

111
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,014
Don't worry, Moco.

112
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,846
We'll find him, kill him...

113
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,215
...and feed him to the dogs.

114
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:29,987
If you see someone dressed in black,
with a guitar case...

115
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,459
...call this number.

116
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,826
His name is Azul.

117
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,163
And if I don't call you...

118
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,100
...you'll kill me, right?

119
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,503
No, I won't.

120
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,666
But he will.

121
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,878
<i>I started to sense I wouldn't have</i>
<i>much luck here.</i>

122
00:20:57,522 --> 00:21:01,686
<i>What happened to the days</i>
<i>when the guitarists were gods...</i>

123
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,623
<i>... like my ancestors?</i>

124
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,594
<i>Technology...</i>

125
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,098
<i>... has crushed us...</i>

126
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,761
<i>... robbed us of our culture...</i>

127
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:18,137
<i>... turned us into machines.</i>

128
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:23,379
<i>Now, there's the most</i>
<i>beautiful creature of the day...</i>

129
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,641
<i>... besides the turtle, of course.</i>

130
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:28,781
What can I get you?

131
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,155
What can I get you?

132
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,224
- A soda.
- Soda?

133
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:40,922
- Are you a kid, or what?
- No, I'm a singer. I can't drink or smoke.

134
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,331
My voice is my life.

135
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,397
Cheers.

136
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,665
I work for almost nothing.

137
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:53,276
I live mostly off tips...

138
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,909
...but I need steady work.

139
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,981
- Where?
- Here in your bar!

140
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,916
I don't have money for a mariachi.

141
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,853
I guess I woke up with bad luck.

142
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,550
What?

143
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,590
Thanks.

144
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:28,941
I need a cheap room for the week.

145
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,110
I'm looking for work.

146
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,152
Can I pay you later?

147
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,217
Yeah, yeah.

148
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,585
Later.

149
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:53,567
Excuse me, sir,
could you leave a deposit?

150
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,407
You don't trust me?

151
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:02,279
I'm sorry.
How much can you give me?

152
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:07,880
I only have a few pesos.

153
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,917
That's fine. Enjoy your stay.

154
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:49,638
Not there! Room 10! 10!

155
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,599
There he goes, you idiots!

156
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:26,475
He's wearing black. Find him.

157
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,665
Over here, morons!

158
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:45,836
What happened, mariachi?
Too much soda pop?

159
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:50,173
I just killed four men.

160
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:55,449
Is it true?

161
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:06,121
Wait! What's your name?

162
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:07,761
Domino.

163
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:11,265
Wait. Domino, it was in self-defense.

164
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:18,438
I'm not from here.
I don't know anyone.

165
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,106
No friends.

166
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,409
No enemies.

167
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:37,928
- They were thieves, then?
- I don't think so.

168
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,564
There were four men.

169
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,090
I'm staying at a cheap hotel.

170
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:47,996
Nothing of value. No money.

171
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:51,005
They were only interested in killing me.

172
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:56,669
Then why come here?
So they can kill me too?

173
00:31:56,848 --> 00:32:01,114
I need a place to stay
until this passes.

174
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,619
They've confused me
with someone else.

175
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:07,781
I'm just a mariachi.

176
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,322
There's a room upstairs.

177
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,795
My room.
Don't touch anything.

178
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:18,493
I'll be up later, and we'll call a friend.

179
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,168
Thank you. I'll never forget this.

180
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,613
This way.

181
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,650
And be careful with my pit bull.

182
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,598
- Good morning, Domino.
- What's up?

183
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:38,840
Give me the phone.
I have to call Moco.

184
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,682
Domino, has anyone strange
come around here?

185
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,992
- Strange people always come here.
- Dressed in black...

186
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,651
...carrying a guitar?
- No.

187
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,129
He killed 10 of our men...

188
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,427
...all in one day.

189
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:11,107
- Aren't you going to call your boss?
- Give me a drink first.

190
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:54,943
Moco, he got away.

191
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,053
He shot me.

192
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,348
He killed several men.

193
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:02,458
One mean son of a bitch.

194
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,618
I didn't get a good look at him.

195
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:08,561
If he changes his clothes,
I won't recognize him.

196
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,598
Don't worry.

197
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:15,898
He always dresses in black
and carries a guitar case.

198
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:17,540
It's his style.

199
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:20,942
But it's not a guitar.

200
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:27,009
It's a case full of weapons.

201
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,923
What?

202
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,367
It's not a guitar.

203
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,271
The case is full of weapons.

204
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:51,040
He uses them on his victims.

205
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:53,871
See you later.

206
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:56,779
Thanks for the drink.

207
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,494
I'll be right back.

208
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,529
I told you not to touch anything.

209
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:26,837
I was trying to relax.
I can get out.

210
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,710
It's okay. Finish up.

211
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,146
Want some shampoo?

212
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,946
Yes, please.

213
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:05,443
Who are you?

214
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,208
A musician.

215
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:12,152
What do you have here?
Guns? Knives?

216
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:14,052
My guitar!

217
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,749
We'll see.

218
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:22,957
You're very modest, mariachi.

219
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,967
You said you killed four men...

220
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,631
...when you really killed 10.

221
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,502
Don't you even want to look?

222
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,788
Play it!

223
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,854
Play something sweet!

224
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,452
Play!

225
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,234
Sing!

226
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:05,035
<i>I've been caught with my pants down</i>

227
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:08,542
<i>And there may be a castration</i>

228
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:11,876
<i>There were several assholes</i>

229
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:15,280
<i>Who tried to rip me to pieces</i>

230
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:18,547
<i>And now I'm with this princess</i>

231
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:21,851
<i>Who's armed with a knife</i>

232
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,018
<i>Big northern eyes</i>

233
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,962
<i>And a ferocious body</i>

234
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:49,479
This is the best I've ever played.

235
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,686
You inspired me.

236
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:54,749
Okay.

237
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:59,555
You're a mariachi, and a good one.

238
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,958
Hire me.

239
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:04,295
I couldn't pay you.
I have no money.

240
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:07,904
This fancy dive,
and you don't have money?

241
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,130
It's true.

242
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,672
Pay me room and board.

243
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:22,442
Will I have to keep the knife
between your legs to inspire you?

244
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,815
If I stay here? No.

245
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:28,083
Just until I find permanent work.

246
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:32,389
You won't find work in this town,
but... Okay.

247
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:45,434
You'll need a better sense of humor...

248
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,975
...if you plan to work for me.

249
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:50,170
This is a letter opener.

250
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,105
Yes?

251
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,182
Just a second.

252
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,223
<i>Amigo...</i>

253
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:44,663
...you haven't answered
the phone all day.

254
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:49,397
<i>You were busy killing 10 of my men.</i>

255
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:51,541
- Six.
- <i>What?</i>

256
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:54,303
I only killed six, asshole!

257
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,412
You were always stupid in math.

258
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,071
That's why you never paid me.
You thought it was all for you.

259
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:04,051
I knew half was yours.
I got carried away. But you...

260
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:08,046
<i>... you're modest.</i>
<i>You killed 10 of my men.</i>

261
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:09,886
Six.

262
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,460
Don't worry. By tomorrow
I'll double the body count.

263
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,723
I'll admit I was greedy.

264
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:20,496
It would have been cheaper for me
if I had paid you.

265
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:23,970
Now I'll have to find 10 more men.

266
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:26,701
- Six!
- Ten!

267
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:31,075
Listen. Give me my money,
and I won't kill anyone else.

268
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:32,909
I'll even spare you.

269
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,916
It's too late for that.

270
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:38,816
We'll have to see this through.

271
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:42,686
Just like the Moco I used to know.

272
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,954
Still wearing white?

273
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,494
What do you see?

274
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:55,571
I see a white suit
soaked with blood.

275
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,550
Ready to play?

276
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:52,190
- We're waiting for you.
- Almost.

277
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,092
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thanks.

278
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:05,299
Hurry up.

279
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:42,944
This song is called "Ganas de Vivir."

280
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,296
A beer.

281
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:55,001
Are you sure
you want me to sleep here?

282
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:57,868
As long as you stay on your side.

283
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:01,601
Remember I have this...

284
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,377
...and him.

285
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:15,280
That first song you played.

286
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:17,427
It's an original, right?

287
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:20,496
How did you know?

288
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:22,825
It seemed like you wrote it
for someone.

289
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:30,996
I did.

290
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,249
Sweet dreams.

291
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:50,980
I need to go to the hotel
for my money.

292
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:55,750
I'll be right back.

293
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:10,300
Watch my things.

294
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,630
Hi. It's Domino.

295
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:46,033
I know.

296
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,299
It's jammed.

297
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:36,682
Son of a bitch.

298
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:06,113
- Good afternoon. What can I get you?
- A beer.

299
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:15,731
In a bottle, dumb-ass.

300
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,439
Isn't there a girl that works here?

301
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,307
Yes, she's the owner.
She'll be right back.

302
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:38,283
She's the owner?

303
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:40,719
Then she must be Moco's girl.

304
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:42,586
I don't know.

305
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:45,159
I see her hanging around a musician.

306
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:18,753
I just saw a guy
with a case like mine.

307
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,564
It's him they want.

308
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:23,960
He didn't say anything?

309
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:25,897
No, he only drank.

310
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:29,996
I don't look anything like him.

311
00:53:57,334 --> 00:54:00,565
Let's go. He can take all three.

312
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,364
It's him.

313
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:04,336
I'm not sure.

314
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:09,333
- What's in the case?
- My guitar.

315
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:13,972
- Don't tell me you're a fucking mariachi.
- I am.

316
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:17,419
Open it.

317
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:22,757
If it's a guitar, you can go.

318
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:28,061
If it's not, we're gonna
fuck you up real bad.

319
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:37,264
Go.

320
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:49,309
Don't carry your guitar around
until this passes.

321
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:51,078
It's the other guy they want.

322
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,891
I better put it upstairs.

323
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,597
What's wrong?

324
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:10,330
What's wrong?

325
00:55:26,189 --> 00:55:28,384
It is him!

326
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,760
It's him.

327
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:13,855
We screwed up.

328
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:17,481
- We didn't know what to do.
- We thought you could defend yourself.

329
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:22,721
You thought I could defend myself.

330
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,930
Against three armed men...

331
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:29,933
...using this?

332
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:36,772
My case got switched
with some stupid mariachi's!

333
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:42,850
Where's the mariachi?

334
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:47,080
He's dead by now,
so go find my case!

335
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:13,708
Where were you
when he came to the bar?

336
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,908
I was on the phone...

337
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:19,612
...talking to a friend
who knows what's going on.

338
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:22,519
- Did you mention me?
- No.

339
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:24,887
He told me the man in black
is named Azul.

340
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:29,465
If his name is Azul,
why doesn't he wear blue?

341
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:32,628
I don't know.

342
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:35,703
But he's killing the men
of a drug dealer...

343
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:39,798
...whose name is Mauricio,
but they call him Moco.

344
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,478
And Moco sent his men to find Azul.

345
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:46,339
So, what do they want with me?

346
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:49,849
Nobody has ever seen Azul.
Only Moco.

347
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:54,914
And Azul wears black
and carries a guitar case.

348
00:59:58,194 --> 01:00:00,560
Sounds like you, doesn't it?

349
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:03,528
Then ask your friend to tell Moco...

350
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,999
...that there's two of us,
a killer...

351
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:10,268
...and a mariachi.

352
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,035
Not just anyone can talk to Moco.
It's best to not go out.

353
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:19,778
Hide your jacket and the case
until this passes.

354
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:38,963
He got away,
but I got a good look at him.

355
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,862
He killed Piסa and Taco.

356
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:44,563
He won't get away again,
I promise you.

357
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,990
Are you always closed on Mondays?

358
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:16,896
Or did you close
because I lost my guitar?

359
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:20,440
I'm closed Mondays.

360
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:21,907
Play me?

361
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:26,070
DOMINO

362
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:29,676
- Hello?
- Come see me.

363
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:33,050
I can't.

364
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:40,086
Please?

365
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:43,292
I don't feel good.

366
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:47,768
Have you ridden the motorcycle?

367
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,808
I have to hang up.

368
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,356
Boyfriend?

369
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:19,935
- A gringo?
- Yeah.

370
01:02:22,638 --> 01:02:25,607
There's one thing I don't understand.

371
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:28,903
If you're so poor like you say...

372
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:31,842
...how did you get this place?

373
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,415
It was a gift.

374
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,521
- From who?
- Mauricio.

375
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:42,988
From Moco,
the man who wants me killed?

376
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:45,184
He doesn't want to kill you.

377
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:47,295
His men confused you with Azul.

378
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:49,260
Same thing.

379
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,998
You know how it is.

380
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:57,469
When you want a girl...

381
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,268
...you give her flowers, candy...

382
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,035
...jewelry...

383
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,042
...until you win her over.

384
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:08,981
Right.

385
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:12,446
Mauricio gave me flowers...

386
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,613
...then jewelry.

387
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:18,025
He let me work in his bar...

388
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:20,719
...then he gave me the bar.

389
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:24,659
What was the last thing he gave you?

390
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:31,837
A motorcycle.

391
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:38,210
He wants me to
ride it out to his ranch...

392
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:40,542
...when I decide to give myself to him.

393
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:44,945
He thinks he can convince me.

394
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:47,255
Can he?

395
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:49,816
He could have...

396
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,631
...but not anymore.

397
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:53,154
Good morning. Take this.

398
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:58,819
I've saved this.
Take it. Buy a new guitar.

399
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:05,099
Take it.
I didn't say to buy the best one.

400
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:08,533
Something temporary,
so you can play again tonight.

401
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:57,712
Loco, look for him.
Black pants, white shirt.

402
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:17,665
- Where did he go, Loco?
- He got in my truck.

403
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:21,066
Bring him around.

404
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:44,349
That's not him.

405
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:40,605
Did you find my case?

406
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:44,984
We didn't find it.

407
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:50,719
We heard you were caught
and taken to Moco's ranch.

408
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:53,854
We came to see if it was true.

409
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:57,456
They got the mariachi.

410
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:40,542
- What can I get you?
- A beer.

411
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,613
Anything else?

412
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,786
My guitar case.

413
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:02,959
Where is he?

414
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:06,024
Where's my case?

415
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:12,298
- Upstairs.
- Go get it.

416
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,978
If you want to see your mariachi,
come with me.

417
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:52,477
Why do you want to help me?

418
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:56,106
Because you know where
Moco's ranch is, and I don't.

419
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:01,749
Let's go.

420
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,217
Play along.

421
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:43,392
Domino! Let's go! Now!

422
01:11:43,565 --> 01:11:45,726
- She's gone.
- Where is she?

423
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:47,835
- She went to find you.
- And the guitar case?

424
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:50,494
She gave him back the case.
They went to find you.

425
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:55,871
Open the door or she's dead!

426
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,041
I'm sorry...

427
01:12:36,218 --> 01:12:38,709
...he used you to get to me.

428
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:44,950
Give me my money or I'll
soak your clothes with her blood!

429
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:49,020
Let her go.
I'll give you your money.

430
01:13:03,912 --> 01:13:06,346
Make me a map to Moco's place.

431
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:13,481
What did you do with him?

432
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:17,919
Who?

433
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:20,061
The mariachi they confused with Azul.

434
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:26,223
That's why you hung up on me
last night.

435
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:30,601
Throwing a party without me?

436
01:13:32,474 --> 01:13:35,602
With that musician's hands
all over you!

437
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:38,008
Give me my money or she's dead!

438
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:40,842
After all I've done for you...

439
01:13:41,016 --> 01:13:43,314
...this is how you treat me?

440
01:13:43,485 --> 01:13:46,283
I've never asked for anything until now.
Let him go!

441
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:53,427
I swear I'll kill her!

442
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,790
You won't kill her.

443
01:13:56,865 --> 01:13:58,389
I will.

444
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:27,726
You feel sorry for her, don't you?

445
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:30,262
All I wanted was my share...

446
01:14:30,432 --> 01:14:33,629
...but you have to kill everyone.

447
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:38,473
That's why you'll never be
as big as me.

448
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:43,075
You have too much heart.

449
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,611
So...

450
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:55,409
...you are the mariachi
who came to my town...

451
01:15:55,584 --> 01:15:57,176
...killed my men...

452
01:15:57,352 --> 01:16:00,082
...and took my girl!

453
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:10,397
You're very talented...

454
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:15,528
...playing your little guitar!

455
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:18,097
Not anymore!

456
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:32,248
Now, get off my property...

457
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:35,282
...and take your hand with you.

458
01:18:24,066 --> 01:18:27,263
<i>All I wanted was to be a mariachi...</i>

459
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:29,131
<i>... like my ancestors.</i>

460
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:34,398
<i>But the city I thought</i>
<i>would bring me luck...</i>

461
01:18:34,576 --> 01:18:37,739
<i>... brought only a curse.</i>

462
01:18:37,913 --> 01:18:40,177
<i>I lost my guitar...</i>

463
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:41,838
<i>... my hand...</i>

464
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:44,812
<i>... and her.</i>

465
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:50,320
<i>With this injury,</i>
<i>I may never play the guitar again.</i>

466
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:55,585
<i>Without her, I have no love.</i>

467
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:59,962
<i>But with the dog...</i>

468
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:01,602
<i>... and the weapons...</i>

469
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:03,465
<i>... I'm prepared...</i>

470
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:06,266
<i>... for the future.</i>

471
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:10,434
