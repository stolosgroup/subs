2
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:32,217
- Hot enough for you?
- She's tried everything.

3
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,600
What about the looks
she was getting…

4
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,187
We were all, frankly, keen on…

5
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,650
No, it's not right for a girl.

6
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,569
…giving you any more money to…

7
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,785
- Look at it this way…
- It's simple to me.

8
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,787
I must stay away from…

9
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,666
- Goin'...
- Excuse me.

10
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,210
Feels like
the whole city is out today.

11
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,253
Summer sales.

12
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:11,589
- Can't keep a New Yorker from a bargain.
- Ain't that the truth?

13
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,758
Let's get to the toy store
and out of this heat.

14
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,469
I'll never hear the end of it
if I don't get my niece a doll.

15
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,179
She asking
for some special sort?

16
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,807
They have those ones
with darling hair you can braid.

17
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,726
- Yes, maybe she'd like that.
- Taxi!

18
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,022
- Oh.
- There now, that's better.

19
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,608
Look at that precious
little pickaninny one.

20
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,111
- That, she'll love.
- No.

21
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,322
She's never even met a colored
who didn't work for us. Thank heavens.

22
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,116
Oh.

23
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,827
No, never mind, ladies.
Accidents will happen.

24
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,704
- My goodness.
- Here you are.

25
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,791
- Here.
- Oh! Thank you.

26
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,795
- What a nice lady.
- Mm-hmm.

27
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,061
There you go, miss.
Thank you so much.

28
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,398
- Thank you.
- Mama, I want that one.

29
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,443
Do you have
the <i>Mother Goose Drawing and Tracing Book</i>?

30
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,819
All sold out.

31
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,907
Figures. I've tried all over town.
My son won't settle for anything but.

32
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,409
Try again in a couple weeks.
Might get lucky.

33
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:25,121
- His birthday's tomorrow.
- Well, better luck next time.

34
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,711
Thank you.

35
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,346
Mister?
Hey, are you all right, sir?

36
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,683
Please, somebody, help me.
I… I… Help me out.

37
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,978
He's fallen down. Sir, can you hear me?

38
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,688
Sir. Sir, you all right?

39
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,357
- What's happened?
- I don't know.

40
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,358
He all right?

41
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,794
This heat.
Feels like I'm about to pass out myself.

42
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:17,298
Yes. I guess it's tea I need.
I'm a little faint.

43
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:21,302
The Drayton, ma'am? They do say
as how there's always a breeze up there.

44
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,973
The Drayton would be lovely.

45
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,101
Oh! Taxi!

46
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,645
Take him to a hospital.

47
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:52,625
Thank you.

48
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,422
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

49
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,087
The waiter will be with you.

50
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,176
Stop it.

51
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,970
- Now?
- Yes, now.

52
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,034
You satisfied?

53
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,587
Come here.

54
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:51,994
See you later.

55
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,955
Don't be long.
I'll get another one.

56
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,415
I won't. I hope.

57
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,209
- You'll be all right?
- I'll be just fine.

58
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,630
I'm going to sit here
and enjoy this cool room.

59
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,674
- All right.
- All right.

60
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:08,136
- I suppose I should…
- I suppose you should.

61
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,400
Oh!

62
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,051
We'll be married soon.

63
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,098
As far as they know, we are.

64
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:03,941
Pardon me. I don't mean to stare,
but I think I know you.

65
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,943
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

66
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,030
No, of course I know you, Rene.

67
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,534
You look just the same.
Tell me, do they still call you Rene?

68
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,954
Yes, though no one's
called me that for a long time.

69
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,791
Don't you know me?

70
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,295
Not really, Rene?

71
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,092
I'm afraid I can't seem to place…

72
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,724
- Clare?
- Mm-hmm.

73
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,309
That's right.

74
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,607
- Not Clare Kendry?
- Mm-hmm.

75
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,942
Now, don't run away.

76
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,070
You simply must stay and talk.

77
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,782
Fancy meeting you here.
It's simply too lucky.

78
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,367
It's awfully surprising, yes.

79
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,202
Mmm.

80
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,123
I'd never have known you
if you hadn't laughed.

81
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,417
You've changed so.

82
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,378
Well, it's been 12 years at least.

83
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,423
You know, I almost dropped by
your father's house not so long ago.

84
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,592
I've thought of you so often.

85
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,844
- You have?
- Of course.

86
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,641
You know, since I've been here,
I've hoped I might run into someone.

87
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,228
Preferably you, though.
And now you're here.

88
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,525
I'll wager you haven't given me a thought.

89
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,110
So…

90
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,280
Tell me.

91
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,076
I want to know everything.
Married? Children?

92
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:41,247
- Yes. Two boys. You?
- Mm-hmm.

93
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,709
One girl. Margery. She's my angel.

94
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,211
My husband John's here on business.

95
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,422
Banking business.
In this heat! Can you imagine?

96
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,673
That was your husband?

97
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:55,303
We've been here a whole week from Chicago.

98
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,387
That's home.

99
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,308
Although I come here
and remember what home really is.

100
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,148
Well, we can see lots of one another
these days that I'm here, can't we?

101
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:11,652
I don't know… I mean… I'm just…

102
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,072
I live in Harlem, still.

103
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,867
I don't come
to this part of town a whole lot.

104
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,746
Oh, that's sad.

105
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,375
Perhaps I can come visit
with you another time in Harlem?

106
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,002
Meet your boys?

107
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,421
We're here quite often.

108
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,716
And if this trip goes well,
well, John's quite sure we'll move.

109
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,679
It's my dream to come back, Rene.

110
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,934
I'm sure.

111
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,023
Clare…

112
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,152
Does he…

113
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,488
Know?

114
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,829
Let's go up to my suite,
where we can talk properly.

115
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,749
Waiter!

116
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:11,295
Ugh. I can't bear this heat!
I have to change.

117
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,465
John'll be back soon.

118
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,177
And here I am, sweatin' up a storm.

119
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,262
- That's nice.
- Oh!

120
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,683
I found Gert Johnson in the phone book.
Well, Gertrude Martin now.

121
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,184
She married Fred. Remember?

122
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,896
Yes. I haven't seen Fred
for an unmentionable time.

123
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,898
Well, they have twins.
Isn't that wonderful?

124
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,442
- Mmm.
- Boys. Oh, I'd love boys.

125
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,903
I'd never risk it again, though.

126
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:39,031
I went through hell those nine months
for fear Margery might turn out dark.

127
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,324
Mine are dark.

128
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,453
Oh. And your husband, he…

129
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:49,291
He… couldn't exactly "pass,"
if that's what you mean.

130
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,086
Oh, I thought…

131
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,381
Oh.

132
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,719
Oh, well, then.

133
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,222
Would you?

134
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,684
Would you?

135
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,364
Well, anyway, she goes as white.

136
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,953
- So, you haven't ever thought to?
- What?

137
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,250
I'm asking
if you ever thought of passing, Rene.

138
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,669
No, why should I?

139
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:39,759
I mean, for convenience,
occasionally, I suppose. But no.

140
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,261
I just mean
I have everything I've ever wanted.

141
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,972
Except perhaps
a little more money.

142
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,517
Of course. That's all
anybody ever wants, a little more money.

143
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,771
Money's an awfully nice thing to have.

144
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,776
In fact, all things considered,
I think it's entirely worth the price.

145
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,614
I should go, Clare.

146
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,366
I'm not sure
it's such a good idea if John…

147
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,160
Oh, no, Rene, it is.

148
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,289
Oh, you must stay a little while longer.
Oh, please say you'll stay.

149
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,168
Hang it! I've made a mess.

150
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,921
Give me a second,
and I'll order us some food up here.

151
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,672
All right.

152
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,849
Whatcha thinking, Rene?

153
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,186
You're curious, is that it?

154
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,231
You can ask me anything.
Anything you want.

155
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,194
What have you told him… of your family?

156
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,492
You know, I haven't had to worry
as much as you'd think.

157
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,619
There were my aunts, you see.

158
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,789
They took me in after Father died
and gave me a home of sorts.

159
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:56,335
Very white,
very respectable, very religious.

160
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,629
I met John not long after,

161
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:02,424
and as soon as I turned 18 and legal,
we got married and…

162
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,970
Well, went off and left for good.

163
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,516
And you're happy?

164
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,768
Of course, Rene.

165
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,355
As you say,
I have everything I ever wanted.

166
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,237
I'm sorry, Clare, that was rude of me.

167
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,447
Of course you're happy.

168
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,825
Look at you.

169
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:34,248
- And your daughter?
- Margery? Oh, she's divine.

170
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,960
John wants to put her in one of those
Swiss boarding schools in the fall.

171
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:42,256
I dare say she'll get quite the education.
Not like anything we had.

172
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,092
Room service, hello?

173
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:49,930
We want cakes.
The most beautiful cakes you have.

174
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,432
Mm-hmm.

175
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:55,728
Tell me, what tea you got
passes for French champagne?

176
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,315
Oh, I'm messing!

177
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:06,238
Yes, we'll take a pitcher of iced tea
in champagne flutes.

178
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,824
Mm-hmm. We're celebrating.

179
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,416
- That's enough, thank you.
- Have a drop more. You've hardly had any.

180
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:22,463
- Nig?
- John, dear!

181
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,133
I ran into an old,
old friend of mine from school.

182
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:30,137
Irene Westover.
Irene, this is my husband, John Bellew.

183
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,264
Pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Westover.

184
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,768
- Actually, it's Mrs. Redfield.
- Mm.

185
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:40,189
Oh, of course, I…
I didn't even think to ask.

186
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,857
I am sorry if I've interrupted.

187
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,444
- Will you get me a drink, honey?
- Here.

188
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,612
Thank you.

189
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:47,780
Hmm.

190
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,325
So, what do you say, then? To old friends?

191
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,828
- To old friends!
- To old friends.

192
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,881
- Did you hear what John called me, Rene?
- Oh, Clare, please.

193
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,134
No, go on, tell her why.

194
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,803
Oh, it's silly.

195
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:14,473
When we were first married,
this woman was as white as a lily.

196
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:19,103
But as the years go by,
she seems to be getting darker and darker.

197
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:23,107
So I told her, "If you don't look out,
you'll wake up one morning

198
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,401
and find
that you've turned into a nigger."

199
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,571
Yeah. She's been Nig ever since.

200
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,921
That's good!

201
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,716
Well, it's silly.

202
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,260
No, that's… That's…

203
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,720
That's good.

204
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,221
My goodness, John!

205
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,975
After all these years,
what would it matter

206
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,145
if you found out
that I was 1 or 2% colored, hmm?

207
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,565
Well, you can turn as black
as you please, as far as I'm concerned.

208
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,983
I know you're not colored.

209
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,363
So, you dislike Negroes, Mr. Bellew?

210
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,533
No, no, no, not at all. I hate them.

211
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:21,290
But not as much as Nig does,
for all she's trying to turn into one.

212
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,084
Why, she won't have them near her,
not even as a maid.

213
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,086
Isn't that true?

214
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,922
Have you ever known any Negroes?

215
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:33,719
No, no,
but I do know people who know them.

216
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,638
And I read about them
in the papers, of course.

217
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,892
Terrible mess. Robbing, killing.

218
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,269
It's sad, really.

219
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:46,899
John, Rene doesn't want to hear
about your pet perversions.

220
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,693
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bore you.

221
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,279
You live nearby?

222
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:54,698
Fairly.

223
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:59,036
It's a great city, New York.
City of the future.

224
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,498
- What line of work is your husband in?
- He's a doctor.

225
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,877
- That's an interesting life.
- Yes. Hard. Nerve-racking too.

226
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,297
Wife's nerves, too, I bet.
All those lady patients.

227
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,300
John, dear, don't start! More tea, Rene?

228
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,844
I've taken up
too much of your time already.

229
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,472
Oh, but we're just getting started!

230
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,017
- Thank you for the drink.
- I'll see you out.

231
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,316
Rene.

232
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,654
- I do hope to see you soon.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Redfield.

233
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,365
- Glad to have met you.
- Goodbye, Clare.

234
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,518
- Evening, Lance.
- Evening.

235
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,572
Hmm.

236
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,618
Where you been?

237
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,745
Lookin' for that darn book.

238
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,373
- They eat?
- I think so.

239
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,918
I was gonna put them to bed, but…

240
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,420
- But you fell asleep.
- Apparently.

241
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,135
Mm.

242
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,013
Am I still sleeping?

243
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,311
Catch it!

244
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,689
Pass, pass.

245
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,318
Hey. Come here.

246
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:27,411
- I thought you nailed this already.
- I forget sometimes.

247
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,037
All right, ten minutes.

248
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,504
- Catch the ball, okay?
- I don't want to.

249
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,589
Don't lose it.

250
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,386
It's boring. Play with me.

251
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,596
Just leave me alone.

252
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,181
Damn!

253
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,188
- Caught!
- Damn it!

254
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,774
Brian, why you gotta be
creepin' around the place like that?

255
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:58,984
Profanity, miss!

256
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,069
They'll be late for school.

257
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,990
I'm not gonna have time to make it
to my next call if I have to drop you.

258
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,911
- Boys, come on in.
- Irene?

259
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,497
Yes, yes,
you have to come on in now.

260
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,582
Sorry, honey.

261
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,593
I was just thinking
how much Junior is getting like you.

262
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,552
Mmm.

263
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,763
I wonder if he isn't
going too fast in school.

264
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,139
It's easy to forget he's younger.

265
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:32,642
I wish you wouldn't be
ever fretting about those boys.

266
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,854
They are fine. They're perfectly
good, strong, healthy boys.

267
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:36,855
I suppose.

268
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,399
I'm just afraid
he's picked up some queer ideas

269
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,485
about things from some of the older boys.

270
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,028
"Queer"? What about?

271
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,864
You know,
things young boys be thinking about.

272
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,992
Ah. You mean about sex?

273
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,953
Yes. Jokes. Things like that.

274
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,664
If sex isn't a joke, what is it?

275
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,502
- What is a joke?
- Don't be facetious.

276
00:22:58,585 --> 00:22:59,419
You ready?

277
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,798
No, you go. I'll take the bus.

278
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:07,219
- Pick you up, then?
- Please. From the printing office.

279
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:10,013
I need to see about more handbills
and tickets for the dance.

280
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,598
They should be paying you.

281
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,227
It isn't charity work
if they pay me for it.

282
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,573
- Go on, boys.
- Are we ready?

283
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,158
Lickety-split!

284
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,701
- Come back.
- Are you ready?

285
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,702
- I'm fast.
- Let's go.

286
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,121
- Go on, boys, get.
- Junior.

287
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,748
- I don't wanna go!
- You have to, I'm afraid.

288
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:37,833
Bye, Mama.

289
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,044
- I'm too fast! Can't catch me.
- Get back here.

290
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,133
- You want grapefruit, ma'am?
- Mm-hmm.

291
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,720
Thank you.

292
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,319
Ugh, my hat.

293
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,533
Oh, Ms. Redfield, you forgot one.

294
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,246
Thank you.

295
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,846
- Do you want me to drive?
- Mmm.

296
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:18,808
Yeah, sure.

297
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,863
Everything set?

298
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,742
We're a month away and all the bookings
are gone, not counting the door.

299
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,162
- Busy as a cat with fleas myself.
- Ain't you cold?

300
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,374
No, leave it, if you're not cold.

301
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,549
This city!

302
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,718
I think I'm beginning to hate sick people.

303
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,973
Their stupid meddling families,
their dirty, smelly rooms...

304
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,849
Come on, now. It's just a bad day.

305
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,894
You don't mean that.
You're helping those sick people.

306
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,188
- Let's not talk about it.
- You brought it up.

307
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,657
- Put the window down.
- Thought you were cold.

308
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,118
Now I'm saying I can't breathe.
Put the window down.

309
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,501
I know you think trying somewhere else
would be easier for us.

310
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,421
South America or some such.
And to a point, I agree.

311
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,090
We should go abroad somewhere.

312
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,843
Not for a while, of course,
but when the boys leave…

313
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,971
- We can visit Brazil.
- Visit?

314
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,976
Or I was thinking of one of them
European schools for Junior.

315
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,979
You are going to make
a mollycoddle out of that boy.

316
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,398
Ted is the one who needs your attention,
not Junior,

317
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:52,611
and you needn't think I'll let you send
Junior to some nice kindergarten school

318
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,821
'cause he's getting
a much-needed education.

319
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:58,908
Sooner he learns about sex, the better.
Certainly if he learns it's a grand joke.

320
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,201
The greatest in the world.

321
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,495
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

322
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:08,960
I'm just getting a little tired
of playing second fiddle

323
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:12,172
to your precious Negro League, that's all.

324
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:17,177
How about a little charity for this Negro?

325
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,471
Come on, now.
There's people looking.

326
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,316
What's this?

327
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,153
- I think it's from Clare Bellew.
- Clare Bellew?

328
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:39,032
That woman from Chicago
you told me about running into?

329
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,493
- Mm-hmm.
- You gonna see her again?

330
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,038
I haven't opened the letter.

331
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,249
- It's postmarked New York.
- I know.

332
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,544
- They must've moved here.
- Brian, I'm not going to see her.

333
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,630
Thought you were good friends in school.

334
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,716
Brian, darling,
I'd have to be an idiot not to realize

335
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,803
if a man calls me a you-know-what,
it's his fault the first time,

336
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,305
but mine if I give him
the opportunity to do it again.

337
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,306
Sure, sure.

338
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,475
May I?

339
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:24,744
"I am so lonely, so lonely…"

340
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,497
"Cannot help longing
to be with you again."

341
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:32,293
- Don't mock her. That's not fair.
- I'm just reading it.

342
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,378
Fine.

343
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:38,133
"You can't know
how in this pale life of mine,

344
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,594
I am all the time seeing
the bright pictures of that other

345
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,389
that I thought
I was so glad to be free of."

346
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,687
Oh, come on, it's funny!
She's very dramatic.

347
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,982
"It may be, Rene dear,

348
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,611
that your way may be the wiser
and infinitely happier one."

349
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:02,323
I'm flattered. "Wiser." As if anything
could rectify the humiliation…

350
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,742
Wait, wait, there's more.

351
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,453
"I wouldn't feel this wild desire…

352
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,663
If I hadn't seen you."

353
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,417
That's rich.

354
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,044
Blaming you.

355
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,550
"Wild desire."

356
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,595
Don't give her an inch.

357
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,355
What you so angry for anyhow?

358
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:38,109
- Husband didn't call you a...
- No, but he would've.

359
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,694
It amounts to the same thing.

360
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,905
It has, you will admit,
its humorous side.

361
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,992
No, I won't.

362
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,787
It's not funny, it's revolting.

363
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:53,208
Irene, leave it, huh?
It's normal. They always come back.

364
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,628
They have to work hard at getting there,
why would they wanna come back?

365
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,755
If I knew that, I'd know what race is.

366
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,591
You'd think they'd be
satisfied being white.

367
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,427
Rot! Who's satisfied being anything?

368
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,981
I am.

369
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:18,858
Hmm?

370
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:21,820
Satisfied.

371
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:26,699
I am.

372
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,375
- Let's go. Wait, Junior!
- Come on, boys.

373
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,919
- Books, books.
- Bye, Mama.

374
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,045
Bye, Mama.

375
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,924
Bye.

376
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:17,166
I got yams for tonight.
Save the chicken for tomorrow.

377
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,334
Yes, ma'am.

378
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,212
- Did you clean the boys' room already?
- Not yet.

379
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,549
Well, hurry. They'll be back soon
and then it'll be impossible.

380
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,010
Can I get you something?

381
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,720
No. I can get it.

382
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,719
Redfield residence.

383
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,639
Yes, hello.

384
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:14,807
Mm-hmm.

385
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:16,893
It's Mr. Wentworth.

386
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,275
Hello. Yes, Hugh.

387
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,444
Oh, quite, and you?

388
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:31,157
Every single one, honest. I know…

389
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,912
Wait, I'll give mine to Bianca.
I won't need it anyway.

390
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,247
No, I mean it.

391
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,917
It was silly of me not to,
I'll be so busy…

392
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:49,968
Mm-hmm.

393
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,352
Well, as long as Brian has a place
to drop down now and then…

394
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,020
Uh-huh.

395
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,443
That's nice. My love to Bianca.

396
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:12,198
Yes, I'll see to it right away.
See you tomorrow, Hugh. Bye.

397
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,921
Dear God,
but aren't you lovely, Clare.

398
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,342
Didn't you mean to
answer my letter, Rene?

399
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,556
Every day I went
to that nasty little post office.

400
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:39,851
They thought I was having an affair
and the man had thrown me over.

401
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,103
- Oh! Clare, I…
- Well…

402
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,272
Eventually it sunk in.

403
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,733
You hadn't written to me
and didn't intend to.

404
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:50,653
I tried very hard to forget,
I really did, but I couldn't.

405
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,532
I had to know why. That's why I came here.

406
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,037
Why didn't you write to me, Rene?

407
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,506
You see…

408
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,513
Well… you see…

409
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,689
I can't help thinking that…

410
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,109
You ought not to…

411
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,446
Ought not to come up here.

412
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,490
- You mean you don't want me here.
- No.

413
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,408
What I said,
you ought not to run the risk.

414
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:41,954
It's terribly foolish.
You must see that, and, well…

415
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,541
Just not the right thing.

416
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,918
Oh!

417
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:51,047
Rene, you are priceless.
The right thing?

418
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,466
- I mean, it isn't safe.
- Safe?

419
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:57,428
To come up here. Considering what I saw
of Mr. Bellew's attitude.

420
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,016
Oh, of course, I understand.

421
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,937
And I don't blame you
for being angry, Rene.

422
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:10,441
You acted beautifully that day,
really beautifully. Thank you.

423
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,194
I don't want thanks.

424
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:18,199
I just mean that… it was very kind of you
to be so delicate about it.

425
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,159
What other option did I have, Clare?

426
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,871
I have been furious at you,
really furious.

427
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,706
- Putting me in that position.
- Of course.

428
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,376
I can't see why you wouldn't
understand why I wouldn't write.

429
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,418
Foolish of me.

430
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,420
Why I wouldn't want
anything to do with you!

431
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,431
Oh, no, now…

432
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,311
Don't cry.

433
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,231
I just… I feel so terrible about it all.

434
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,484
Oh, I… I didn't think…

435
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,237
I'm so very sorry, Rene.

436
00:35:57,446 --> 00:36:00,032
There, there. Don't be.

437
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,160
I'm sorry too.

438
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,461
Oh, darn it. The truth is
I'm very glad to see you, Clare.

439
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:14,839
Very.

440
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,801
Oh, and I you, Rene. You can't imagine.

441
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:24,307
Without that day, I would've got
to the end, unable to speak to anyone.

442
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,684
You can't know.

443
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,563
Never anyone to <i>really</i> talk to.

444
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:33,774
It was insensitive of me
not to think about that.

445
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,860
Oh, I don't expect you to understand.

446
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,029
You're happy.

447
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,659
You have a true, good life,
and you're free.

448
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:45,953
Free and safe.

449
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,457
Safe.

450
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,710
I don't even know what that is anymore.

451
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:01,052
I'm beginning to believe that no one
is ever completely happy, free, or safe.

452
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,263
Well, then, what does it matter
if I come up here sometimes?

453
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:08,976
You have a child, Clare.
It's not just a matter of your safety.

454
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,649
Being a mother
is the cruelest thing in the world.

455
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,860
- Hello. Redfield residence.
- Yes.

456
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,029
One moment…

457
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,447
And the most responsible.

458
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,493
Mr. Wentworth
is on the telephone again, ma'am.

459
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,286
Excuse me.

460
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,550
Hello?

461
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:51,686
Oh, honestly, Hugh, tell her to stop
being silly. I've told you it's fine.

462
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,814
Mm-hmm. See you tomorrow.

463
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,239
You sound busy.

464
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,826
It's this
Negro Welfare League dance tomorrow.

465
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:10,579
I'm on the organizational committee.
I am the committee, pretty much.

466
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:14,333
- Hugh Wentworth, the novelist?
- Yes. Do you know him?

467
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,585
- I've read a book or two of his.
- You have?

468
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,172
- They're good, aren't they?
- I suppose.

469
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,757
Sort of contemptuous.

470
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,678
Yes. Well, he's a dear, really.

471
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,014
Mind if I do some things around the house?

472
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,224
- I wasn't expecting guests.
- Oh, I don't mind.

473
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,642
You can show me your home.

474
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,188
So, Hugh Wentworth's
coming up to your dance, huh?

475
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,316
Yes. Why not?

476
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,277
Curious to me.

477
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,238
A man like that going to a Negro dance.

478
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,283
Hundreds of white people like Hugh
come to affairs in Harlem now

479
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:50,244
- Why?
- Same reason you're here. To see Negroes.

480
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,205
What are you doing, boys?

481
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,959
To enjoy themselves, to get material,

482
00:38:57,043 --> 00:39:00,046
to gaze on the great and near-great
as they gaze on the Negroes.

483
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:02,256
Rene, suppose I come too?

484
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,844
- Why, because so many white people go?
- No, because it'll be fun.

485
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:10,097
I don't know.
What if somebody recognizes you?

486
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,932
I'll take my chances on getting by.

487
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,894
- You'll be bored stiff.
- I won't, honestly. I won't.

488
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,897
- I won't be able to look after you.
- I'll be as good as gold.

489
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,900
I'll just sit there
and gaze at the great and not-so-great.

490
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,652
Look, I don't care
what you do or where you go,

491
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,780
but I don't see why you should
put yourself in a place

492
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,114
that might bring you trouble.

493
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,200
Damn John!

494
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:33,371
He gets in the way of everything I want.
I could kill him.

495
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:34,789
I wouldn't.

496
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,833
There's still capital punishment
in this state, at least.

497
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,630
I want so much to be around Negroes again.

498
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,883
Talk with them, hear them laugh.

499
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,637
I've almost forgotten it…

500
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,307
Damn!

501
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:59,313
- Shall I go down?
- No, it's nothing.

502
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,148
Zu will clean it.

503
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:04,860
Zu!

504
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,698
Come to the dance if you want to.
I'm not going to stop you.

505
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:13,369
Thank you, Rene.
That's so kind of you. Really, thank you.

506
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,286
Boys?

507
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,539
- What do you want? We're busy.
- Junior.

508
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:20,709
Oh, now, don't be cross.
I know I've gone and spoiled everything,

509
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,712
but if I promise not to get in the way,
will you let me in?

510
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,969
It will just be us for dinner.

511
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,513
It's just as well.
I don't have any more for more.

512
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:37,268
Well, they were the cowboys
and I was the Indian,

513
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,562
and they captured me
right outside the fort.

514
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,856
But I think I just made my getaway.

515
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,571
Pay him no attention.
Junior gets ahead of himself fast.

516
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:54,368
Mmm. What's cooking?
Yams? How you fixin' them?

517
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:59,039
- Butter, salt, sugar. Simple.
- Simple!

518
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,460
Why, it's just about
the most perfect taste on God's earth!

519
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,880
Where did you find her, Rene?

520
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,757
I long for a maid
who knows real home cookin'.

521
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,136
- It's not like that.
- Not like what?

522
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,263
Everyone needs help. It's normal.

523
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:21,854
- Maybe next time you can stay for dinner.
- Oh, please, yes.

524
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,399
How about I stop by tomorrow
and we can go to the dance together?

525
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,692
All right.

526
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:29,737
- All right. See you tomorrow, then.
- Tomorrow. Yes.

527
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,573
- Bye, Rene.
- Mm.

528
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,258
- All right, come on in.
- I didn't get a chance yet.

529
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:10,653
- Thought you might've fallen asleep.
- No. Out on time. For once.

530
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,112
Ooh, good.

531
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:18,035
- You nervous?
- Hey, get off. You're sitting on my dress.

532
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,467
- Clare's coming. Clare Bellew.
- Hmm?

533
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,221
- That crazy woman, Clare?
- Her, yes, her.

534
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,556
Crazy woman Clare Bellew.

535
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,849
- She's not crazy.
- Since when?

536
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,893
Just… different.

537
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:51,068
She surprised me with a visit yesterday.

538
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,238
Yesterday?
Why in the world didn't you tell me?

539
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:57,324
- Don't know. I had a lot to think about.
- Irene.

540
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,828
She made it sound not such a problem
if she came with us, so…

541
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:01,996
I said fine.

542
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,084
- She's coming here?
- Any minute, I would think.

543
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,128
Be nice, huh?

544
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,755
I highly doubt it.

545
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,008
I mean, you be nice to her.

546
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,426
I will be polite.

547
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,808
Gonna dress or lie there?

548
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,696
Quit hovering. Go wait for me downstairs.

549
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,038
Wait, I'm sorry. I love you.

550
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,416
Boy! You are nervous.

551
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,889
Oh, I thought
I'd never get better.

552
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,183
I had such a fever.
I thought I'd die. Truly.

553
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:07,770
It was quite the epidemic.
I can't recall how many cases I treated.

554
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,521
- Not all of them made it.
- Mmm.

555
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,273
- So you're lucky.
- Yeah.

556
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,567
Of course,
many more survived on my watch.

557
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,486
I'm not bragging.

558
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:16,904
And what if you are?

559
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:20,616
It's worth bragging about if it's true.

560
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:21,742
You may be right.

561
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,538
I'm sorry,
I didn't realize you were here already.

562
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,916
Don't worry.
We made our own introductions.

563
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,125
Yeah, we did.

564
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,461
- You look lovely, Rene.
- Mm-hmm.

565
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,091
I'm afraid I may have chosen all wrong.

566
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:40,177
Rot! It's perfect.

567
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,304
- …do it again.
- You told me.

568
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,889
Here they are!

569
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,892
Well, how do I look?

570
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,603
Like a princess.

571
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,939
All right, all right.

572
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,608
- Good night and good night.
- Good night.

573
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,569
I feel exactly as I used to
the night before Christmas.

574
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,864
I knew there was a surprise waiting
for me, but I could never guess what.

575
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,033
- Ah.
- I'm so excited.

576
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,953
You can't possibly imagine.

577
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,497
- "You can't possibly imagine."
- Stop now.

578
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,875
Hi.

579
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:15,003
That music sounds good.

580
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,549
They'll be there.

581
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,773
Bianca, I am outraged.

582
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:45,784
There's Hugh!

583
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,078
Anywhere to sit?

584
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,081
In that booth with Hugh
if we can get there.

585
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,208
What a hoot!

586
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,056
There he goes!

587
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,080
Hey, where'd you learn this dance?

588
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,832
You taught me everything I know.

589
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,751
Felise, Dave!

590
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,796
- It's a triumph! The band is peachy!
- It's a riot!

591
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,341
- Come on, Brian. We're going dancing.
- What...

592
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:45,302
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

593
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,346
Look out, Clare.
The man has two left feet.

594
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,017
- Is that true?
- No.

595
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,312
Yes, it's very true. Bit rusty.

596
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,147
- Well, let's give it a go.
- All right.

597
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,070
Okay.

598
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:14,414
"Poor man, rich man, beggar man, thief…"
How's the rest of it go?

599
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:19,294
"Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief."
All here and a few more.

600
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,885
What I'm trying to find out
is the history and status

601
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:30,347
of the blonde beauty out of the fairy tale
that you've brought along.

602
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,306
See?

603
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,227
The one currently seen
dancing with your husband.

604
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:39,690
She's a girl from Chicago I used to know.
She's very excited I know you.

605
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,276
Good of her, I'm sure.

606
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:47,072
Can you spot
my wayward wife in the throng?

607
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,535
Ah, yes!

608
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,579
Ah. The usual problem.

609
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:57,541
All these gentlemen of color have driven
a mere Nordic out of her mind.

610
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:58,458
Stop!

611
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,795
Have I laid eyes on her tonight
except in spots here and there

612
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,839
being twirled about by some Ethiopian?

613
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,132
I have not.

614
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:08,093
Well, sir, you have to admit
that the average colored man

615
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,928
is a better dancer than the average white.

616
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,389
That is if the celebrities
who find their way up here

617
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,224
are fair specimens of your sort.

618
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:18,020
Having not tripped the light fantastic
with any of the males,

619
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,689
I am hardly in a position
to argue the point.

620
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:31,450
Bianca and Co. are always raving on

621
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:36,705
about the good looks of some Negro,
especially an unusually dark one.

622
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,373
Like Ralph Hazelton there.

623
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:42,628
Dozens of women
have declared him fantastically handsome.

624
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,171
What do you think? Is he?

625
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:47,507
No. And I don't think
anyone else would either.

626
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:52,012
It's just plain exoticism.
An interest in what's different.

627
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,181
A kind of emotional excitement…

628
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:58,018
Something you feel in the presence
of something strange

629
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,896
and, even perhaps, a bit repugnant to you.

630
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,105
And there you have it.

631
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,195
So, do you subscribe to the notion

632
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:12,157
that our motives for coming up here
are predatory?

633
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:13,659
No.

634
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,536
More curious, I should say.

635
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,289
Like your princess from Chicago.

636
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:25,504
What is that supposed to mean?

637
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,924
Things aren't always what they seem, Hugh.

638
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,349
I'll be damned.

639
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,603
- Nobody could tell from looking at her.
- No.

640
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,231
Most surprising.

641
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,193
Tell me,
can you always tell the difference?

642
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:51,530
- Oh, now you really are sounding ignorant.
- No, no, I mean it.

643
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:55,283
Feelings of kinship
or something like that?

644
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:58,954
Stop talking to me like you're writing
for the <i>National Geographic.</i>

645
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,455
I can tell same as you.

646
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,543
And I suppose sometimes there is a…

647
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,379
A thing… a thing that can't be registered.

648
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,674
Yes, I understand what you mean.

649
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:15,345
Yet, lots of people pass all the time.

650
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,472
It's easy for a Negro to pass for white.

651
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:21,393
I'm not sure it would be so simple
for a white person to pass for colored.

652
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,354
Never thought of that.

653
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,607
No, Hugh. Why should you?

654
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,193
Sometimes I think you could.

655
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,446
Yes.

656
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:35,615
And in a way, if you can,
why wouldn't you?

657
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,576
Sorry. Hey.

658
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:40,954
- I'm asking, why wouldn't you?
- Who's to say I'm not?

659
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:45,167
- You're being unusually cryptic this...
- And you are being an ass.

660
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:47,961
I just mean…

661
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,339
We're all of us passing
for something or other.

662
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:56,887
Aren't we?

663
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,057
An ass, am I?

664
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:05,270
Ah, my feet hurt
like a… a marathon runner's.

665
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,648
I am in awe of your energy!

666
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,151
Well, I suppose
I ought to go retrieve my wife

667
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,905
before some man or other
steals her away from me indefinitely.

668
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:17,074
Won't you dance with me, Mr. Wentworth?

669
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:20,577
It's not quite my strong suit, Ms. Bellew.

670
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,413
- Hugh.
- Brian.

671
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,710
- Thank you.
- And for you.

672
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,880
- Thank you.
- Your husband has ruined me, Rene.

673
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:34,633
I must have another dance with him.
He's the best here!

674
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:39,763
I guess my wife hasn't told you
that I do not respond well to flattery.

675
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,808
Uh, however, I would be more than happy

676
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:45,727
to find you a suitable replacement.

677
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:46,895
- Oh.
- Mmm.

678
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,900
Now, this… this is your man.

679
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:35,944
- You?
- Yeah.

680
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,822
You'll do. Come along.

681
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:43,201
- See ya.
- He doesn't stand a chance.

682
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,619
None whatsoever.

683
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:46,663
Oh!

684
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:50,041
You know, I'm rather glad she came.

685
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:56,131
Isn't she
extraordinarily beautiful, though?

686
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,841
No, not particularly.

687
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,719
- You're fooling!
- No.

688
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:05,348
I mean, she'd be a rather unusually
good-looking white woman, I suppose.

689
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:09,728
But personally, I like my women darker.

690
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:11,855
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

691
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,780
Maybe it's just because she was so happy.

692
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,074
Shh.

693
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,081
Irene, watch yourself.

694
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,167
Mmm?

695
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,253
Don't find yourself responsible
for that kind of happiness.

696
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:38,131
Nonsense.

697
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,687
Hey, can it!

698
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:40,568
Clare?

699
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,405
Goin' back to bed, Mama?

700
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,949
No, of course not, sweetie.

701
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:51,246
- Where's Clare?
- She's coming later when you'll be in bed.

702
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:54,666
- But she sends you special kisses.
- But Pa said she'd play with me.

703
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:58,962
Ted, take your brother to the kitchen
and get something to eat.

704
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,505
I don't want something to eat.

705
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,717
- Ted, I said go take your…
- 'Scuse me.

706
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,889
Sorry. I told Junior Clare would be here.

707
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,893
What's that about?

708
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:18,148
Somebody called him a dirty…

709
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,651
You-know-what today.

710
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,881
- Zulena?
- Out back, Rene.

711
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:50,138
What in the world?
Clare, aren't you freezing?

712
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:53,975
When the Lord brings you
a magical day like this, I say lap it up.

713
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,393
You're crazy.

714
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:59,022
- Zu, can you help with these groceries?
- They call this an Indian summer.

715
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:01,358
- An Indian summer?
- Zu.

716
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:08,531
Zu and I were just talking
about the Charlestons next door.

717
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,242
- That eldest girl is getting so pretty.
- She is.

718
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,995
Ted can barely look at her.

719
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:23,046
- Puberty makes such a mess of friendships.
- Puberty <i>is</i> a mess!

720
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,923
Amen to that!

721
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:26,549
I don't know.

722
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,135
You had a lot of friends, as I recall.

723
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,846
I suppose.

724
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:37,936
Sometimes I wonder
why we weren't better friends.

725
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,563
Oh, we did all right.

726
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,317
I always admired you, though.

727
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:50,573
You were always so calm
and beautiful in the face of everything.

728
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:53,076
Me? Come on, now.

729
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,203
You were always the beauty.

730
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:58,957
Not how I see it.

731
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,426
Staying for dinner?

732
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,052
I can't.

733
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,179
John's coming home.

734
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:16,683
Oh, I thought next week.

735
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,060
Back early.

736
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,312
Misses me.

737
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:25,900
Can't say I feel the same.
Wish he'd stay away always.

738
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,404
- You mustn't say that.
- Mustn't I?

739
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,844
Still coming to bridge?

740
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:55,638
Heaven forfend I miss the bridge, Rene!

741
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,923
"It was dusky inside
and smelled like wood and oil."

742
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:33,676
"She bumped her head on a light bulb
dangling from the ceiling."

743
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,261
Want to take the next part?

744
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:39,098
"All that time, the rat steadied the bulb

745
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,935
and pulled the chain,
and light flickered."

746
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:45,813
There was a lynching in Little Rock.
You hear about that?

747
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,982
- Not now.
- What happened?

748
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:51,653
A Black man was accused
of assaulting two white women.

749
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,072
What did he do to them?

750
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:57,242
It's less a question
of "what" than "if," Ted.

751
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,786
- But they lynched the man anyway.
- Exactly.

752
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,204
Junior, go brush your teeth.

753
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,206
They…

754
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:05,792
- Chased him…
- Brian.

755
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:09,337
They caught him, hung him from
a telephone pole, and they shot him.

756
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:13,132
- But why, Papa?
- Because they hate us, son.

757
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,677
I said, Brian, not now.

758
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:21,474
Come here.

759
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:26,437
Seems as though
we can't discuss these things

760
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,856
without distressing
the ladies of our family.

761
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:33,987
- All right?
- Yeah.

762
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,114
Go brush those teeth, hmm?

763
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:51,963
I know I take being a mother
rather seriously.

764
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:55,925
I know I'm wrapped up in my boys
and the running of my house.

765
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,595
But I don't think
there's anything funny in that.

766
00:59:58,678 --> 00:59:59,762
Oh, Rene, I know.

767
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:03,141
You're so good. So perfect.

768
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,394
You say that like it's a bad thing.

769
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,817
Let's sit here a minute.

770
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,613
I like hearing him play.

771
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:41,429
Don't think, whatever happens,
I'll forget how good you've been to me.

772
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,266
- What are you talking about?
- I mean it.

773
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:49,937
You see, I…

774
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:56,027
I don't have proper morals
or a sense of duty like you.

775
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,573
- You're talking nonsense.
- But it's true, Rene.

776
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,204
Don't you realize?

777
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,750
I'm not like you one bit.

778
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:23,012
Why, to get the things
I want so badly, I'd do anything.

779
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:25,765
Hurt anybody.

780
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,895
Throw anything away.

781
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:33,898
Anything.

782
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:40,697
I'm not safe.

783
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,253
Clare, stop it.

784
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,797
What you're saying is wrong.

785
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,675
You've always had so much,
you haven't given up a thing.

786
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,230
Clare?

787
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,014
Oh, I'm sorry.

788
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,642
Has Mae called?

789
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:54,103
I don't know where she could be.

790
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,898
Damn Zu taking the night off…

791
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,275
She does have to see her family
from time to time.

792
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:05,823
Oh, but, we're late already and…

793
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,994
Well, it is my last night
before I leave for Europe.

794
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:17,794
Why don't I stay with the boys
and you two go?

795
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,796
- Really?
- I don't mind.

796
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:23,174
- No, we can't leave you.
- Oh, yes, you can.

797
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:26,385
And it will make the numbers even.

798
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:33,100
Well, now I really have to play bridge.

799
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,694
- Go on, now.
- But I'll miss you, Rene.

800
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:47,073
No, you won't. Go on. Get.

801
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,082
Go on, now.

802
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,673
This is where all the talent is.

803
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,593
Yeah, and the hooch.

804
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:50,052
Where's Princess tonight?

805
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:52,847
It's a rarity having the two of you
all to myself.

806
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,433
She's in Europe.

807
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:58,978
Her daughter's in boarding school.
Switzerland, of all places.

808
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,901
- What?
- Nothing. Just, uh…

809
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:08,070
What do you know about Switzerland?

810
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:13,951
Well, I shouldn't miss her too much.
I find her hard work.

811
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:15,995
Well, some would say the same of you.

812
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,747
True.

813
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:23,044
But I call it shameless, what she does.
Always playing the victim.

814
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:24,837
"Poor little tragic me," etcetera…

815
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,797
It's a low way
of making yourself popular...

816
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:29,467
- I don't think that's fair.
- I didn't quite finish.

817
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:35,514
But she does maintain a certain charm.

818
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:38,726
Hugh, you hardly know the woman.

819
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:41,687
- Since she isn't here to defend herself...
- You will?

820
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:45,399
Very chivalrous of you, I'm sure.

821
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:09,966
- Afternoon, Lance.
- Irene.

822
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,391
Have to let this dry before we attach it.

823
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:09,150
This is nice, isn't it? Just us four.

824
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:17,491
- I'll make some hot chocolate.
- Yes, please!

825
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:20,870
Look out!

826
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,174
No, I want to keep talking about it.

827
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:36,427
- You two look serious.
- We're talking about John Carter.

828
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:40,139
The one that got lynched in Little Rock.

829
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,809
- That again?
- You gotta know about these things.

830
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:46,312
- Do I?
- Do we have any more nuts?

831
01:07:46,979 --> 01:07:48,731
- I'll see.
- I want some too.

832
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:52,568
You know they did more
than just shoot him.

833
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:56,072
They attached his body to a caravan,
dragged it through the city.

834
01:07:57,865 --> 01:08:00,659
- Did you tell your father that?
- He told me.

835
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:02,953
He did?

836
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:08,751
I'm old enough not to be spoken to
like a child anymore.

837
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:19,678
Thank you for dinner, Mama.

838
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:35,027
I wish you wouldn't keep talking to them
about all that lynching stuff.

839
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,195
Why?

840
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:40,116
There'll be time for them to learn
about horrible things when they're older.

841
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:43,244
- Right now, they're safe.
- You are absolutely wrong.

842
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:46,705
If you are determined
to have them grow up in this damn country,

843
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,999
the sooner they find out, the better.

844
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:52,002
But they're happy. Why ruin that?

845
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,922
- I want them to stay happy.
- Irene.

846
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:59,885
What is the use
in keeping things from them? Hmm?

847
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:03,180
We tried to keep them
from hearing the word "nigger."

848
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:05,224
- Don't use those...
- They found out the hard way.

849
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:07,977
You are not to talk
about the race problem. I won't have it.

850
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:11,105
- It is my house too. They need to know...
- They don't!

851
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:14,942
They do not.

852
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:24,577
I don't understand how someone
as intelligent as you can be so stupid.

853
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,769
I wanted to leave
this hellish place years ago.

854
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:57,318
I have been saying
we should go away for a bit.

855
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:05,618
But then you seemed happier
having Clare around, so…

856
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,204
The hell has Clare got to do with...

857
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:10,664
Only that we would have
gone on a trip but for that.

858
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:12,833
I gave up that idea because you objected…

859
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,419
- I never objected to having Clare...
- God damn it!

860
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:18,422
Irene, I'm not talking about Clare.

861
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:20,341
- It seems...
- I'm not talking about a trip!

862
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:22,176
I am talking about leaving this...

863
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:27,014
It seems to me you are a lot less content
with what you've got when she's not here.

864
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:17,041
<i>Not how I see it. No.</i>

865
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:03,712
I'm getting up.

866
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:06,006
Don't worry.

867
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:08,801
Hmm.

868
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:15,808
- It was good of you to think to call me.
- Always the attentive husband.

869
01:13:17,142 --> 01:13:18,977
All of those people coming to tea.

870
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:23,273
Thank goodness everything is ready.

871
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:29,279
- Clare's downstairs.
- Clare? How?

872
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:31,365
I didn't invite her, purposely.

873
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:35,577
Uh, she's been back for a while.
Zu's always taking messages,

874
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:38,038
and you never seem to respond.

875
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:39,790
Might a mere man ask why?

876
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:45,212
This party is for Hugh, and Hugh happens
not to care a great deal for her, so…

877
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:47,631
I didn't ask her.

878
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:50,801
If you ask me, his dislike
has less to do with her

879
01:13:50,884 --> 01:13:55,764
and more to do with the attention
she happens to not give him very much of.

880
01:13:56,348 --> 01:13:58,058
- You love Hugh.
- I do.

881
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:00,936
But you'll admit he has
a godlike opinion of himself.

882
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:02,187
I disagree.

883
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:05,858
He thinks far better of himself
than that.

884
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:34,344
Brian?

885
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:37,764
I'm sorry. It's my fault, Irene.

886
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:42,811
She seemed hurt at being left out.
I told her I was sure you'd forgotten.

887
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:50,360
But, Brian, I…

888
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:58,869
You spoke to her, then?

889
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:01,413
Yes.

890
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:04,500
Of course you did.

891
01:15:15,385 --> 01:15:18,263
In spite of what I said,
Clare does add to any party.

892
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,809
She's so easy on the eyes.

893
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:28,982
You won't be long?

894
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:51,088
- Thank you.
- Sorry.

895
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:55,217
We're all discussing
<i>La Josephine.</i> You've seen her, I presume?

896
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:58,762
- Josephine Baker? No, never.
- You're missing out.

897
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:02,474
She may have been
in <i>Shuffle Along</i> when I saw it,

898
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:05,894
but I can't remember.

899
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:07,938
I much prefer her
to Ethel Waters.

900
01:16:08,021 --> 01:16:10,524
Ethel Waters is awfully good.

901
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:14,152
Hello, Felise, so glad you made it.

902
01:16:14,861 --> 01:16:16,655
Oh, come back. Irene.

903
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:20,492
You haven't sat down all afternoon.

904
01:16:21,201 --> 01:16:22,744
I wanna talk to you.

905
01:16:27,624 --> 01:16:31,378
Come out of it, whatever it is.
You look like the second gravedigger.

906
01:16:31,461 --> 01:16:33,422
I'm not quite feeling up to par.

907
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:38,010
- The weather, I guess.
- Buy yourself an expensive frock.

908
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:39,344
It always helps.

909
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:43,056
I have been trying to get her alone
all afternoon. Clare!

910
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:47,477
You look too divine,
sitting so quiet like a painting!

911
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,730
- Come over for a gathering next month.
- You must!

912
01:16:49,813 --> 01:16:52,274
I was telling Dave
I just finished his book.

913
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:55,277
- You've read his books?
- Of course, I've read all of 'em!

914
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:57,863
Oh.

915
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:03,452
So sorry, Rene, I must've pushed you.
Clumsy of me.

916
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:09,124
Don't tell me,
it's priceless and irreplaceable?

917
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:12,044
No, you didn't push me, I'm quite sure.

918
01:17:13,211 --> 01:17:15,881
That pot was the ugliest thing

919
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:19,051
that your ancestors,
the charming Confederates, ever owned.

920
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:21,845
I've forgotten how many
thousands of years ago it was

921
01:17:21,928 --> 01:17:25,849
that Brian's
great-great-great-great uncle owned it…

922
01:17:25,932 --> 01:17:30,562
What I mean is I never figured out how
to get rid of it till just this minute.

923
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:34,024
Inspiration! I had only to break it,
and I was free of it forever.

924
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:37,527
- Simple.
- Well done.

925
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:43,909
- My lovely.
- Oh, that was wonderful.

926
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:47,079
Well done.

927
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:51,500
Brian, thank you so much
for a tea party that…

928
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:53,460
- Bye, Rene.
- …can never be matched.

929
01:17:53,543 --> 01:17:55,629
- Staying for dinner?
- Oh, I can't tonight.

930
01:17:55,712 --> 01:17:59,549
Oh. Right.
Too bad. Brian's got work, anyway.

931
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:01,426
- So glad to see you.
- So long.

932
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:06,682
Thank you so much.
We had a marvelous time.

933
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:08,392
Good to see you. Thank you.

934
01:18:14,564 --> 01:18:17,651
- Then I beat Patrick in a race.
- Hat! Hat!

935
01:18:17,734 --> 01:18:19,945
Race you up the steps! Can't catch me.

936
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:22,406
I'm not letting you have it. No!

937
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:25,867
Evening.

938
01:18:33,583 --> 01:18:34,751
My goodness.

939
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:40,173
- Heavens, my eyes are watering.
- I fear my fingers might fall off.

940
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:41,800
This wind is brutal!

941
01:18:43,009 --> 01:18:43,844
Excuse me.

942
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:48,557
Oh, Mrs. Redfield! How do you do?

943
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:09,661
That was abrupt.

944
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:15,000
You just passed the only person I ever met
while disguised as a white woman.

945
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:46,114
Hello, Central Quincy 5-4-7-3.

946
01:19:49,534 --> 01:19:52,913
Hello, is Mrs. Bellew in? It's urgent.

947
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:58,043
No?

948
01:20:04,007 --> 01:20:04,966
Never mind.

949
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:10,013
It isn't that urgent.

950
01:20:11,389 --> 01:20:12,557
I'll try again later.

951
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,546
Irene.

952
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:09,716
Irene.

953
01:22:13,219 --> 01:22:14,930
What are you doing? It's freezing.

954
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:18,516
Are we going to that party with Clare?

955
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:39,496
Have you ever been up to the sixth floor?

956
01:22:39,579 --> 01:22:43,500
Of course!
My father was a janitor.

957
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:46,378
Back in the old days

958
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:49,923
when every ramshackle apartment
had its own elevator.

959
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:51,007
Elevator?

960
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:56,680
- Oh, you can't mean we have to walk up?
- All the way to the top.

961
01:22:56,763 --> 01:22:58,264
Oh, Lord!

962
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:01,101
Why on earth would anyone live here?

963
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:04,396
She says it discourages
the casual visitor.

964
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:07,107
- Says she'd rather be dead than bored!
- Huh.

965
01:23:10,902 --> 01:23:12,862
Damn these thin shoes.

966
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:17,909
What is it, Rene?

967
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:23,415
Have you ever thought of what you'd do
if John found out?

968
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:24,916
Yes.

969
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,253
Don't fall by the wayside
before the fourth floor.

970
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:31,506
I absolutely refuse to carry anybody up
more than two flights.

971
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:39,264
And? What would you?

972
01:23:40,932 --> 01:23:43,560
I'd do what I want
more than anything right now.

973
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,187
I'd come up here to live.

974
01:23:47,063 --> 01:23:49,399
In Harlem. With you.

975
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:10,754
Lord.

976
01:24:31,691 --> 01:24:33,026
Come on, slowpoke.

977
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:47,415
…dinner at Eddie's,
then Leroy's, then Smalls.

978
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:50,168
Those dancers seem strange to anyone else?

979
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:53,171
- No, honey, just the liquor.
- That's why I've given it up.

980
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:54,923
- Since this morning?
- Yes.

981
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,717
And nothing in the least exciting
has happened...

982
01:24:57,801 --> 01:24:59,844
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

983
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:02,514
I wouldn't.
I've heard the drinks here aren't safe.

984
01:25:06,726 --> 01:25:10,814
Irene, have you taken a vow
not to laugh again?

985
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:15,568
No. It's simply the rest of you
are so clever, I'm speechless.

986
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:17,654
You haven't a drink. What will you take?

987
01:25:18,738 --> 01:25:20,323
Ginger ale and three drams of scotch.

988
01:25:20,406 --> 01:25:22,659
Scotch first, then the ice,
then the ginger ale.

989
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:26,079
Don't attempt
to mix that yourself, Dave, honey.

990
01:25:26,162 --> 01:25:29,082
- Have the butler make it.
- And the footman, would you?

991
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:41,029
- Yes, it's a perfect evening.
- Good.

992
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:57,337
Don't stand there.
Aren't you freezing?

993
01:26:58,755 --> 01:27:03,051
Come. Come talk to me,
or at least listen to me gabble.

994
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:06,054
- Evening, can I help you?
- Let me in.

995
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:09,557
Perhaps
you've come to the wrong house.

996
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:11,684
I know where I am. Let me in.

997
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:13,895
Which apartment
are you looking for, sir?

998
01:27:13,978 --> 01:27:16,064
- My wife is in there.
- Your wife?

999
01:27:16,147 --> 01:27:18,816
No, sir, she's not here. I guarantee it.

1000
01:27:19,525 --> 01:27:22,487
- Excuse me, I think you're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

1001
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,697
- Do not come in!
- Sir, calm down.

1002
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:26,658
- What's going on?
- Out of my way.

1003
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:27,575
Can I help you?

1004
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:32,121
I've been to the Redfields'
and I know she's with them.

1005
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:33,456
Ralph, where's my drink?

1006
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:43,174
Save yourself the trouble
and get out of my way.

1007
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,970
I know what you're doing here. I know.

1008
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:51,140
I'm Redfield.
What the devil's the matter...

1009
01:27:51,224 --> 01:27:53,935
You don't get to tell me what to do!
Any of you people!

1010
01:27:54,018 --> 01:27:55,270
It's best you leave.

1011
01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:56,813
You liar!

1012
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,400
Careful.
You're the only white man here.

1013
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:05,863
You dirty liar.

1014
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:23,423
Oh!

1015
01:28:26,259 --> 01:28:27,885
Good Lord Jesus!

1016
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,555
- Hurry.
- Quickly!

1017
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:33,349
Quickly!

1018
01:28:35,893 --> 01:28:36,978
Go downstairs.

1019
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:54,972
Her husband's just sitting there?

1020
01:29:56,766 --> 01:29:57,767
I don't know.

1021
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:00,311
You don't know?

1022
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:02,397
I don't know
for sure if she's dead.

1023
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:14,283
I imagine he was
just trying to protect his wife.

1024
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:16,452
Doesn't strike me
as particularly unusual.

1025
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:21,958
Is she…

1026
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,838
Is she…

1027
01:30:47,316 --> 01:30:48,401
Irene, you mustn't.

1028
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:51,112
You'll make yourself sick.

1029
01:30:51,195 --> 01:30:55,116
I mean, she just tumbled over
and was gone.

1030
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:56,993
Irene was there
beside her, weren't you?

1031
01:30:57,076 --> 01:30:58,161
This lady here?

1032
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:00,413
You're sure she fell?

1033
01:31:00,496 --> 01:31:02,790
Her husband
didn't give her a shove or anything,

1034
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:05,001
as Dr. Redfield here seems to think?

1035
01:31:06,085 --> 01:31:09,672
No. I'm quite sure she just fell
before anyone could stop her.

1036
01:31:09,755 --> 01:31:11,090
It was so quick, I…

1037
01:31:14,177 --> 01:31:16,929
- Careful.
- Anyone else notice anything?

1038
01:31:17,013 --> 01:31:19,056
- You mustn't.
- None of you saw how she fell?

1039
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:23,394
- He was upset, that's true.
- So an accident?

1040
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:27,565
I guess an accident, yeah.

1041
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:29,484
That's what I thought.

1042
01:32:15,321 --> 01:32:16,447
I love you.

1043
01:32:20,243 --> 01:32:22,453
Death by misadventure,
I'm inclined to believe.

1044
01:32:22,537 --> 01:32:24,830
Let's go up
and have a look at that window.

1044
01:32:25,305 --> 01:33:25,702
