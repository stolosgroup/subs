Who are the real-world Illuminati ?
Find out @ saveanilluminati.com

3
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:11,437
There he is.

4
00:02:15,438 --> 00:02:17,737
Is this your first job?

5
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:19,039
- My first job?
- Hm.

6
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:21,669
I've never killed a man

7
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:23,437
if that's what you mean.

8
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:28,539
It's not as hard
as you might think.

9
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,471
- Depends on the man.
- Which man?

10
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:36,072
The target, or the man
doing the killing?

11
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:39,971
Both.

12
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:57,971
Tell me, friend, what did you
do before the war?

13
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:03,073
I was a baseball player.

14
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:07,437
You know baseball?

15
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,103
Oh, baseball.

16
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,170
Like Joe DiMaggio.

17
00:03:11,672 --> 00:03:13,505
<i>Did he ever kill anyone?</i>

18
00:03:15,306 --> 00:03:17,103
Not that I know of.

19
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,539
Good luck, my friend.

20
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:28,671
You'll be fine.

21
00:03:31,072 --> 00:03:33,672
Just do it before
the <i>Gestapo</i> figures it out.

22
00:03:34,537 --> 00:03:36,404
I'll try.

23
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:19,635
Two out top of the third,
man on first.

24
00:04:19,637 --> 00:04:21,569
Moe Berg still in the catcher.

25
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:25,534
<i>Fifteen years in the league
and still standing.</i>

26
00:04:25,536 --> 00:04:27,102
<i>How long can this guy go on?</i>

27
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:30,970
<i>Runner takes his lead.</i>

28
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:35,237
<i>Moe calls the sign.</i>

29
00:04:40,904 --> 00:04:42,736
<i>Okay, now here's the pitch.</i>

30
00:04:42,738 --> 00:04:44,001
<i>The runner goes.</i>

31
00:04:44,937 --> 00:04:46,536
<i>Berg throws down to second.</i>

32
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,103
<i>Got him.</i>

33
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,169
Hey, don't shake me off.

34
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,037
I don't wanna a change-up
when somebody's stealing.

35
00:04:58,039 --> 00:04:59,535
I barely got him.

36
00:04:59,537 --> 00:05:01,469
How'd you know
where he was goin'?

37
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:02,903
I just knew.

38
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,136
How you holding up?

39
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,836
What do you mean?

40
00:05:23,838 --> 00:05:25,102
Sooner or later
I'm gonna need your spot

41
00:05:25,104 --> 00:05:26,336
on the roster, Moe.

42
00:05:27,571 --> 00:05:30,302
- Make it later.
- It is later.

43
00:05:30,304 --> 00:05:31,535
I've been asking
for two seasons

44
00:05:31,537 --> 00:05:33,167
to hang up the cleats
and coach.

45
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:35,068
I like it out there.

46
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,135
<i>You hardly play.</i>

47
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:38,202
All the more reason
to hang on.

48
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:41,702
Look, I didn't want to
stop playin' either.

49
00:05:41,704 --> 00:05:43,135
So, what do you say?

50
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:45,569
Finish out the season,
then coach?

51
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:47,370
I could go to Detroit.

52
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:48,768
Mickey'd let me play.

53
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,634
Mickey's an idiot.

54
00:05:50,636 --> 00:05:53,370
So are you,
for letting me play.

55
00:05:56,702 --> 00:05:58,502
You get a call
about the Japan thing?

56
00:05:58,504 --> 00:05:59,601
Yeah.

57
00:05:59,603 --> 00:06:02,202
- <i>You goin'?</i>
- Absolutely.

58
00:06:02,204 --> 00:06:04,668
- Who else is going?
- Uh, we got Murderers' Row.

59
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,134
We got Ruth, Gehrig, Averill,
Gehringer, Gomez.

60
00:06:08,136 --> 00:06:09,535
Am I the only bum?

61
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:11,102
They like
the Professor Berg thing.

62
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,103
They also like
that you speak Japanese.

63
00:06:14,471 --> 00:06:16,435
Who said I speak Japanese?

64
00:06:16,437 --> 00:06:18,704
<i>Kieran, in one of his columns.</i>

65
00:06:21,304 --> 00:06:23,168
- Interesting.
- Say..

66
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,771
Barker House? Steaks?

67
00:06:25,537 --> 00:06:26,803
No, thanks.

68
00:06:28,203 --> 00:06:29,436
Okay, mystery man.

69
00:06:33,337 --> 00:06:34,936
<i>What you staring at, rookie?</i>

70
00:06:36,002 --> 00:06:38,067
What's the story with Berg?

71
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:41,569
- What do you mean?
- Uh, he seems strange.

72
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:42,935
What the hell
are you talking about?

73
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:44,835
I don't know.
He just seems odd.

74
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,434
Mind you own business, Dalton.

75
00:06:46,436 --> 00:06:48,369
Does he, does he bat lefty?

76
00:06:49,436 --> 00:06:51,037
How the hell should I know?

77
00:06:51,868 --> 00:06:53,267
Why should I care?

78
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:56,702
It's just I don't feel like
showing my dick to a queer.

79
00:06:56,704 --> 00:06:58,304
Well, don't show it
to him, then.

80
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:01,368
Somebody ought to find out.

81
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,403
<i>You're Moe Berg, aren't you?</i>

82
00:07:19,536 --> 00:07:20,800
Who?

83
00:07:20,802 --> 00:07:24,736
Moe Berg,
the baseball player.

84
00:07:24,738 --> 00:07:26,835
Oh, no. You know,
but I must look like him.

85
00:07:26,837 --> 00:07:28,768
Everybody says
I look like him.

86
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,268
You're kidding.

87
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,599
No, I ain't him.

88
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:33,334
But I sure as hell
must look like him.

89
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,401
Ha!

90
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:38,334
Where am I dropping you?

91
00:07:38,336 --> 00:07:39,500
A couple more blocks.

92
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:41,335
I'll walk from there.
It's fine.

93
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:42,469
Suit yourself..

94
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,335
...Mr. Berg.

95
00:07:47,371 --> 00:07:50,866
Actually, you know what, stop.
Here. That's good.

96
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:09,869
<i>I wouldn't have
been able to tell.</i>

97
00:08:09,871 --> 00:08:11,400
Really?

98
00:08:11,402 --> 00:08:13,567
Well, I was on my third
martini by that point, so...

99
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:14,700
You flatter me.

100
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:19,667
So, what did you think
of the place, honey?

101
00:09:04,736 --> 00:09:06,966
Mr. Dalton,
you live around here?

102
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:08,567
Man, fuck you!

103
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:13,700
I didn't catch your answer.
Do you live around here?

104
00:09:14,937 --> 00:09:17,866
- Do you live around here?
- No! No.

105
00:09:17,868 --> 00:09:19,867
Do you know what the word
"Hypothetical" means?

106
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:22,968
No? It means, let's suppose.

107
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,165
<i>Let's suppose there was
a baseball player</i>

108
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:29,102
a rookie, who intruded on the
privacy of another ballplayer

109
00:09:29,104 --> 00:09:31,799
who was reaching
the twilight of his career

110
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:33,432
and really had nothing
to lose at this point.

111
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:34,601
Are you following so far?

112
00:09:34,603 --> 00:09:36,600
You fucking faggot!

113
00:09:43,202 --> 00:09:45,700
You think you know everything,
don't you?

114
00:09:45,702 --> 00:09:47,601
I don't know anything,
alright?

115
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:49,967
I..

116
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:56,900
Now, you'll be pleased
to know Cronin..

117
00:09:58,668 --> 00:10:02,000
Cronin is considering
putting you in the lineup.

118
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,568
Show some improvement
and you got a shot.

119
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:07,199
Good luck.

120
00:11:18,935 --> 00:11:20,467
Don't stop.

121
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:22,098
That's beautiful.

122
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,499
You're a liar.
And you're late.

123
00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:28,534
I had some people to see.

124
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:33,066
Play.

125
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,467
Where did that come from?

126
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:54,666
The way you looked at me
when I came in.

127
00:12:54,668 --> 00:12:57,600
Any normal man would've
done the same thing.

128
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:00,866
I didn't look at you.

129
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:03,667
I had my back turned.

130
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,099
And the reason
that I love you

131
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:09,530
is that you're the farthest
thing from a normal man

132
00:13:09,532 --> 00:13:11,300
that anyone would
ever think of.

133
00:13:15,565 --> 00:13:18,630
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for..

134
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,733
The Information Game!

135
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:24,165
Yes, the show
where the elite meet

136
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:27,163
to mete out the meat
of their minds.

137
00:13:27,165 --> 00:13:29,532
Tonight, our special guest
is Moe Berg

138
00:13:29,534 --> 00:13:31,997
catcher for the Boston
Red Sox, and for those of you

139
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:33,565
who actually read
John Kieran's articles

140
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,598
will know him
as Professor Berg

141
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,831
top graduate
from Princeton University

142
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,765
also holding advanced degrees
from Columbia University

143
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:43,598
and the Sorbonne University
in Paris, France.

144
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,765
Welcome, Professor Berg.

145
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:46,931
Thank you.

146
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:50,564
<i>Moe will do.</i>

147
00:13:50,566 --> 00:13:52,265
- Happy to be here.
- Well, Moe it is.

148
00:13:52,267 --> 00:13:55,164
And, Moe, let's play ball.
Our first question is for you.

149
00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:03,064
- Excellent.
- Thank you.

150
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:04,797
Very well done.

151
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,764
And I'll see you next week.

152
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:09,630
- Thank you.
- Bye.

153
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:10,698
Bye-bye.

154
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:14,797
<i>Trick question? Me?</i>

155
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,198
<i>The Canary Islands
aren't named for a canary.</i>

156
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,731
The name is derived
from the Latin word <i>canis</i>

157
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:24,598
which means dog.

158
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,398
<i>The islands were named
for the wild dogs</i>

159
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,862
<i>that are found there.</i>

160
00:14:27,864 --> 00:14:28,863
Right you are.

161
00:14:28,865 --> 00:14:31,897
Well, so far, Moe Berg
is batting a thousand!

162
00:14:35,665 --> 00:14:38,898
So, Moe, tell us a little bit
about yourself.

163
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,764
Is there a Mrs. Berg?

164
00:14:40,766 --> 00:14:43,630
<i>Ah, yes, she's married
to my father.</i>

165
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:48,797
<i>I meant is there
a Mrs. Berg in your life?</i>

166
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,297
<i>Does this count for points?</i>

167
00:14:52,466 --> 00:14:55,431
<i>Wow, you sure wriggled
your way out of that one.</i>

168
00:14:55,433 --> 00:14:57,466
<i>Moe Berg, the walking enigma.</i>

169
00:14:58,133 --> 00:14:59,363
<i>That is..</i>

170
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,732
<i>Well, that's the case</i>

171
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:01,795
<i>with old Whitby.</i>

172
00:15:01,797 --> 00:15:04,064
- <i>Very similar.</i>
- <i>Was it always?</i>

173
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:05,298
<i>Always. Because of that,
people...</i>

174
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,295
How do you know
all of these things?

175
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:09,664
Well, it's common knowledge.

176
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,030
Well..

177
00:15:11,032 --> 00:15:13,865
Oh, I'm going to Japan.

178
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,130
An exhibition tour
after the season.

179
00:15:18,132 --> 00:15:21,364
Oh, Moe, I have always
wanted to see Japan.

180
00:15:21,366 --> 00:15:23,032
I'll take some pictures.

181
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:26,596
Or you could take me, and I'll
take the pictures myself.

182
00:15:26,598 --> 00:15:29,763
- Oh, Estella, come on.
- I'd really like to go, Moe.

183
00:15:29,765 --> 00:15:33,330
It's just a series
of exhibition games.

184
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,396
And I'm sure the other players
are taking their wives.

185
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:37,498
You're not my wife.

186
00:15:43,432 --> 00:15:44,530
Mm.

187
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:45,665
I didn't mean
anything by that.

188
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:48,363
I was simply stating it
as a fact.

189
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,429
It was more than that, Moe.

190
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:50,896
It wasn't more than anything.

191
00:15:50,898 --> 00:15:52,898
- <i>Estella.</i>
- What?

192
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:56,665
Why do you not want
to take me to Japan, Morris?

193
00:16:01,531 --> 00:16:03,897
I would just rather go alone.

194
00:16:07,765 --> 00:16:10,400
Well, that wasn't so hard,
was it?

195
00:16:23,864 --> 00:16:25,497
<i>Tokyo is host of Babe Ruth</i>

196
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:27,929
<i>and his barnstorming
American baseball team</i>

197
00:16:27,931 --> 00:16:30,664
<i>on their goodwill
exhibition tour of Japan.</i>

198
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:52,395
Jesus Christ.

199
00:17:52,397 --> 00:17:54,062
He know their languages.

200
00:17:54,064 --> 00:17:55,496
That makes 12.

201
00:17:57,597 --> 00:18:00,829
Welcome to Japan, Mr. Berg.

202
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,530
I'm sure you're going
to enjoy it here.

203
00:18:04,365 --> 00:18:07,394
My name is Isao Kawabata.

204
00:18:07,396 --> 00:18:09,496
It's such a pleasure
to meet you.

205
00:18:12,162 --> 00:18:12,963
The pleasure is mutual.

206
00:18:25,565 --> 00:18:26,830
<i>Move it, move it!</i>

207
00:18:37,264 --> 00:18:39,629
Don't they know
he only batted 235?

208
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:40,929
Right.

209
00:18:47,863 --> 00:18:48,995
- Oh!
- Oh!

210
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:02,096
Please, tell me
all about baseball.

211
00:19:02,098 --> 00:19:05,030
It looked like
such as interesting game.

212
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,862
You don't know anything?

213
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,993
Nothing.

214
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:14,297
Well, baseball's a game
where people fail

215
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:16,662
a lot more often
than they succeed.

216
00:19:16,664 --> 00:19:18,627
Sounds very much like life.

217
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:20,429
Yes, it does.

218
00:19:21,396 --> 00:19:23,362
So, what do you do?

219
00:19:23,364 --> 00:19:26,393
I am a professor of history.

220
00:19:26,395 --> 00:19:27,961
Now that sounds interesting.

221
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:30,929
So why would a professor

222
00:19:30,931 --> 00:19:33,530
who doesn't know anything
about baseball be at a game?

223
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:38,728
Maybe you don't fully
understand, Mr. Berg.

224
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,828
This visit is very important.

225
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:43,763
It goes beyond sport.

226
00:19:45,198 --> 00:19:48,795
Our cultures are very different,
and growing further apart.

227
00:19:50,596 --> 00:19:54,427
If we don't stop to learn
about one another, then..

228
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:55,894
Then what?

229
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:59,261
There'll be no more games.

230
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:20,128
You're happy here?

231
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:24,362
I am.

232
00:20:24,364 --> 00:20:25,829
Why?

233
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,595
<i>When I was growing up</i>

234
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:35,027
<i>my first baseball team
was a church team.</i>

235
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:36,461
<i>But I'm a Jew.</i>

236
00:20:36,463 --> 00:20:38,795
<i>Now, I was never
a practicing Jew</i>

237
00:20:38,797 --> 00:20:42,729
but I was different
than the other boys.

238
00:20:42,731 --> 00:20:44,362
I never even told them
my real name.

239
00:20:44,364 --> 00:20:46,130
I tried to blend in.

240
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,128
I wanted to hide.

241
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,595
And it worked.

242
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:52,529
Do you like to hide, Mr. Berg?

243
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,028
I do.

244
00:20:58,895 --> 00:21:00,161
I don't fit.

245
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:06,728
Even now, I have no real home,
I have no wife.

246
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:12,895
Do you have a wife, Isao?

247
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:14,694
I do.

248
00:21:14,696 --> 00:21:17,260
And six children.

249
00:21:17,262 --> 00:21:19,029
She's very fertile.

250
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,760
I like to hide too.

251
00:21:51,163 --> 00:21:53,527
Now, can I ask you
an important question?

252
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:55,294
Yes.

253
00:21:55,296 --> 00:21:57,827
You're a professor of history.

254
00:21:57,829 --> 00:22:00,594
Will there be a war
between our two countries?

255
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:09,395
Yes.

256
00:22:10,995 --> 00:22:13,662
It has been progressing
step-by-step.

257
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,061
It is quite inevitable.

258
00:22:18,828 --> 00:22:20,394
<i>Everything will change.</i>

259
00:22:23,262 --> 00:22:25,863
<i>And we'll all play our part.</i>

260
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:32,061
I also think
after this visit..

261
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:36,294
...we will never
see each other again.

262
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,963
I hope you're wrong.

263
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:47,394
As do I.

264
00:23:46,295 --> 00:23:50,461
<i>The attack yesterday
on the Hawaiian Islands</i>

265
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:53,293
<i>has caused severe damage</i>

266
00:23:53,295 --> 00:23:57,291
<i>to American naval
and military forces.</i>

267
00:23:57,293 --> 00:24:00,993
<i>I regret to tell you
that very many American lives</i>

268
00:24:00,995 --> 00:24:02,726
<i>have been lost.</i>

269
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:56,325
Hello, Jerry.

270
00:24:56,327 --> 00:24:59,623
Moe, nice to see you.
Been a long time.

271
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:00,926
I was hoping you'd be here.

272
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,758
Oh, yeah? Why?

273
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,027
I understand you're working
in Washington.

274
00:25:06,526 --> 00:25:08,224
Where'd you hear that?

275
00:25:08,226 --> 00:25:10,826
One of the guys.
I can't remember who.

276
00:25:18,394 --> 00:25:20,994
- State Department?
- Uh, yeah, sort of.

277
00:25:22,926 --> 00:25:24,493
How'd you come to get the job?

278
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:29,925
There's room for people
with languages.

279
00:25:29,927 --> 00:25:31,325
That's what I figured.

280
00:26:04,494 --> 00:26:07,191
- How are your knees?
- What do you mean?

281
00:26:07,193 --> 00:26:10,726
I figure a professional
ballplayer's getting 4F.

282
00:26:10,728 --> 00:26:12,126
Bad hinges.

283
00:26:12,993 --> 00:26:15,427
My knees are as passable
as my Italian.

284
00:26:18,294 --> 00:26:20,125
Have you heard
of Bill Donovan?

285
00:26:20,127 --> 00:26:22,891
Yeah, sure. Yale, football.

286
00:26:22,893 --> 00:26:24,926
Medal of Honor, 1918.

287
00:26:24,928 --> 00:26:26,393
He's my boss.

288
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:32,024
We're setting up a small adjunct
to the State Department.

289
00:26:32,026 --> 00:26:33,359
Here's the number.

290
00:26:37,827 --> 00:26:40,925
- Give this man a call.
- Thanks.

291
00:26:42,592 --> 00:26:45,325
First time I've seen you
at one of these things.

292
00:26:45,327 --> 00:26:47,991
Well, first time
I've come to one.

293
00:26:47,993 --> 00:26:50,924
<i>Gentlemen, may I have
your attention please?</i>

294
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:53,158
We are at war.

295
00:26:54,193 --> 00:26:56,525
In light of what lies
before us

296
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:59,757
<i>the challenges, the sacrifices</i>

297

Interesting film
you brought back, Mr. Berg.

323
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:49,889
What made you make it?

324
00:28:49,891 --> 00:28:51,823
I happened to be in Japan.

325
00:28:51,825 --> 00:28:54,090
A lot of people
happen to be in Japan.

326
00:28:54,092 --> 00:28:56,456
Not all of them go to the top
of a building in Tokyo

327
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:58,556
and make home movies of the
harbor and naval shipyards.

328
00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:01,857
I had the opportunity.

329
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:03,625
It seemed the sensible
thing to do.

330
00:29:05,592 --> 00:29:08,123
How did you know then that
we would be at war with Japan?

331
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:09,757
"The Journal
Of Oriental Society"

332
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:10,889
was filled with articles

333
00:29:10,891 --> 00:29:12,324
about going to war with Japan.

334
00:29:13,193 --> 00:29:15,256
You read the "JOS?"

335
00:29:15,258 --> 00:29:19,089
Ah, uh, well, that wasn't
apparent from what I just said?

336
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:22,089
Yes, yes, I suppose it was.

337
00:29:23,991 --> 00:29:25,789
But no one in the government
or the army

338
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:26,990
asked you
to make the film?

339
00:29:26,992 --> 00:29:28,156
No.

340
00:29:28,158 --> 00:29:30,289
You did it
as a private citizen?

341
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:32,022
Yes.

342
00:29:34,492 --> 00:29:36,760
You're an unusual man,
Mr. Berg.

343
00:29:37,858 --> 00:29:39,155
Yes, so I'm told.

344
00:29:39,157 --> 00:29:40,456
Have a seat.

345
00:29:41,825 --> 00:29:43,723
Not married, no children.

346
00:29:45,425 --> 00:29:47,557
Odd for a man your age, no?

347
00:29:49,092 --> 00:29:50,524
Never occurred to me.

348
00:29:51,658 --> 00:29:54,457
May I ask you
a very personal question?

349
00:29:56,792 --> 00:29:58,125
You may.

350
00:29:59,592 --> 00:30:00,824
Are you queer?

351
00:30:04,324 --> 00:30:06,592
I'm good at keeping secrets.

352
00:30:15,057 --> 00:30:17,456
You're also good
at some other things.

353
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:20,054
You speak
seven languages fluently

354
00:30:20,056 --> 00:30:21,557
another three or four
to a lesser degree.

355
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:22,955
In addition,
you're an athlete,

356
00:30:22,957 --> 00:30:25,156
which means you're more than up
to the physical requirements

357
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:26,455
of the job.

358
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:27,856
What job?

359
00:30:27,858 --> 00:30:29,290
Any job we might care
to give you

360
00:30:29,292 --> 00:30:31,224
in the event that we
bring you into the fold.

361
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:35,723
Moe, Jerry Fredericks
speaks very highly of you.

362
00:30:35,725 --> 00:30:38,256
We're looking for people
who can keep secrets

363
00:30:38,258 --> 00:30:39,989
but not from us.

364
00:30:39,991 --> 00:30:43,123
We're fighting a war here.
It's very serious business.

365
00:30:44,392 --> 00:30:46,690
Now, personally,
I don't care who a man fucks

366
00:30:46,692 --> 00:30:48,625
as long as he can help us
win this war.

367
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:52,589
If it comes down to it

368
00:30:52,591 --> 00:30:54,858
I'm willing to die
for my country.

369
00:30:59,923 --> 00:31:02,322
They say that patriotism

370
00:31:02,324 --> 00:31:04,755
is the last refuge
of a scoundrel.

371
00:31:04,757 --> 00:31:06,988
It isn't they.

372
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,689
It's Samuel Johnson.

373
00:31:08,691 --> 00:31:11,757
And it's not the last,
it's the first.

374
00:31:13,825 --> 00:31:15,823
Welcome to the OSS, Mr. Berg.

375
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:21,787
<i>There were many new developments
today at home and abroad.</i>

376
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:25,522
<i>The headlines, Germans claim
victory in the Crimea.</i>

377
00:31:25,524 --> 00:31:28,356
<i>The Russians report gains
around Moscow and Leningrad.</i>

378
00:31:28,358 --> 00:31:31,022
<i>President Roosevelt signs
the Neutrality Law.</i>

379
00:31:31,024 --> 00:31:33,855
<i>And then captive coal mine
strike ties up production.</i>

380
00:31:33,857 --> 00:31:36,656
<i>And Congress prepares
anti-strike legislation.</i>

381
00:31:36,658 --> 00:31:38,490
<i>And in France,
the Germans advanced</i>

382
00:31:38,492 --> 00:31:40,422
<i>along the Saint-Michel salient</i>

383
00:31:40,424 --> 00:31:43,255
<i>taking in the town
of Saint Ramelle and Toulon.</i>

384
00:31:43,257 --> 00:31:45,088
<i>On the southern front</i>

385
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,522
<i>allied advances
continued in Sicily.</i>

386
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,822
Great report on
the Serbian border unit.

387
00:31:51,824 --> 00:31:52,888
Thank you.

388
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,989
I'm going crazy.

389
00:31:54,991 --> 00:31:57,321
I am not made
for desk work, alright?

390
00:31:57,323 --> 00:31:59,254
You got to get me
out onto the field.

391
00:31:59,256 --> 00:32:01,788
- You're useful here.
- Well, I hate it, alright?

392
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,088
I'm used to being
on a ball field all day.

393
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,222
If I stay cooped up in here,
I'm going to kill somebody.

394
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,422
Maybe myself.

395
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,356
Oh!

396
00:32:42,756 --> 00:32:43,889
- Oh!
- Oh!

397
00:32:45,157 --> 00:32:46,423
Mr. Berg!

398
00:32:52,189 --> 00:32:54,155
Yeah?

399
00:32:54,157 --> 00:32:55,756
Someone chasing you?

400
00:32:56,757 --> 00:32:58,553
I don't know.

401
00:32:58,555 --> 00:33:00,288
Well, it's good
that you're here.

402
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:01,821
Come with me.

403
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,254
Where are we going?

404
00:33:05,256 --> 00:33:07,120
Be careful
what you wish for, Berg.

405
00:33:07,122 --> 00:33:08,189
Because you just might get it?

406
00:33:08,191 --> 00:33:09,656
Because it could get you
killed.

407
00:33:15,155 --> 00:33:16,388
Gentlemen.

408
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,856
Moe Berg. Bob Furman.

409
00:33:20,155 --> 00:33:21,520
Hi, nice to meet you.

410
00:33:21,522 --> 00:33:23,587
This is Professor
Sam Goudsmit.

411
00:33:24,856 --> 00:33:27,020
If you would.

412
00:33:27,022 --> 00:33:29,954
Bob, Moe, Sam.

413
00:33:40,056 --> 00:33:41,956
We have something for you.

414
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:45,986
Since this war began..

415
00:33:45,988 --> 00:33:48,954
...we've been engaged
in a massive research

416
00:33:48,956 --> 00:33:51,888
and development program,
called the Manhattan Project.

417
00:33:52,856 --> 00:33:54,286
The purpose of which

418
00:33:54,288 --> 00:33:56,454
is the creation
of a fission bomb.

419
00:33:57,657 --> 00:33:59,786
Now, if initial calculations
are correct

420
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:03,120
one bomb would be enough
to wipe out an entire city.

421
00:34:03,122 --> 00:34:06,521
The war could be decided
in a day.

422
00:34:06,523 --> 00:34:07,954
We have reason to believe

423
00:34:07,956 --> 00:34:10,389
the Germans are also working
on such a bomb.

424
00:34:11,521 --> 00:34:12,388
Sam.

425
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:13,887
The scientist leading

426
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:16,354
the atomic fission program

427
00:34:16,356 --> 00:34:17,921
is Werner Heisenberg.

428
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:23,954
So, we must get to him

429
00:34:23,956 --> 00:34:26,022
and find out how close
the Germans are to a bomb.

430
00:34:27,955 --> 00:34:30,586
Now, he has left Berlin.

431
00:34:30,588 --> 00:34:33,089
And we don't know where
he is or what he is doing.

432
00:34:33,091 --> 00:34:35,054
But, uh, he has remained
in contact

433
00:34:35,056 --> 00:34:36,619
with an Italian physicist

434
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:40,320
with whom I worked,
uh, Eduardo Amaldi.

435
00:34:40,322 --> 00:34:43,055
So we'd start in Italy,
the three of us.

436
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:47,319
Sam for the physics,
me, military

437
00:34:47,321 --> 00:34:49,055
and you, OSS.

438
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:53,420
- Where in Italy?
- Rome.

439
00:34:53,422 --> 00:34:55,088
Our fifth army is
moving north.

440
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:58,453
They should take the city
in a week or two.

441
00:34:58,455 --> 00:35:01,518
We'll go in, find the
physicist and interrogate him.

442
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,953
Uh, interview him, please.

443
00:35:04,955 --> 00:35:06,053
Amaldi is my friend.

444
00:35:06,055 --> 00:35:09,220
Uh, if the Italian physicist
has any value

445
00:35:09,222 --> 00:35:12,222
won't the Germans take him when
they pull out, or kill him?

446
00:35:12,224 --> 00:35:15,121
Well, that's why we'd actually
go in with the Fifth Army

447
00:35:15,123 --> 00:35:16,554
to prevent that from
happening.

448
00:35:19,489 --> 00:35:21,054
It's not desk work.

449
00:35:21,056 --> 00:35:22,154
No, it's not.

450
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,519
Could be fun.

451
00:35:25,521 --> 00:35:28,787
Ah, an athlete's
uncomplicated hubris.

452
00:35:30,487 --> 00:35:33,320
I do not speak of fun,
Mr. Berg.

453
00:35:33,322 --> 00:35:34,654
Figure of speech.

454
00:35:36,589 --> 00:35:38,285
<i>If the enemy intercepts
your communication</i>

455
00:35:38,287 --> 00:35:40,655
<i>they can easily discern
what you have written there</i>

456
00:35:40,657 --> 00:35:42,953
simply by holding
the paper over a flame

457
00:35:42,955 --> 00:35:44,687
or treating it
with a reactive chemical

458
00:35:44,689 --> 00:35:46,820
<i>such as sodium carbonate.</i>

The German MP 40.

460
00:35:54,656 --> 00:35:57,355
Very effective weapon
for close combat.

461
00:35:57,357 --> 00:35:59,921
Never hold the gun
by the clip when firing

462
00:35:59,923 --> 00:36:02,487
<i>as that can cause
the gun to jam.</i>

How's work?

470
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:34,986
It's just work.

471
00:36:36,155 --> 00:36:38,088
And when do you go back to DC?

472
00:36:38,755 --> 00:36:41,555
I, uh, I'm not going to DC.

473
00:36:42,321 --> 00:36:43,819
Not for a while.

474
00:36:43,821 --> 00:36:45,953
Well, how long do I have you?

475
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:46,953
Hm?

476
00:36:48,987 --> 00:36:50,220
Till tomorrow.

477
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:56,122
- Why am I not surprised?
- I'm sorry, Stell.

478
00:36:57,356 --> 00:36:58,587
I'm..

479
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:02,786
...going overseas.

480
00:37:06,287 --> 00:37:08,486
You brought me here
to say goodbye?

481
00:37:08,488 --> 00:37:10,221
- I'll be back.
- Who knows?

482
00:37:16,355 --> 00:37:18,955
Y... you know that I love you.

483
00:37:21,389 --> 00:37:22,652
Simple yes or no.

484
00:37:22,654 --> 00:37:25,319
D... do you know
that I love you?

485
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,087
I really wanted us
to be perfect.

486
00:38:12,953 --> 00:38:14,119
That's all.

487
00:38:15,455 --> 00:38:16,753
We are.

488
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:20,118
Liar.

489
00:38:36,053 --> 00:38:37,685
Difficult?

490
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:07,819
- May I?
- Hey. Come in.

491
00:39:19,822 --> 00:39:21,620
Tell me about Heisenberg.

492
00:39:24,219 --> 00:39:26,152
Well, he's a somewhat
complicated man.

493
00:39:27,821 --> 00:39:29,184
Yeah, just before
the war started

494
00:39:29,186 --> 00:39:30,785
uh, we were together
at the conference

495
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:32,720
at the University of Michigan.

496
00:39:33,687 --> 00:39:36,319
And Furman and I begged him

497
00:39:36,321 --> 00:39:38,217
not to go back to Germany.

498
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:39,184
- But he went.
- Yeah.

499
00:39:39,186 --> 00:39:42,085
But to save German science
from the Nazis.

500
00:39:43,453 --> 00:39:46,350
And now he's the head
of the atomic bomb program.

501
00:39:47,453 --> 00:39:49,149
Could he build a bomb?

502
00:39:49,151 --> 00:39:51,885
Could he or would he?

503
00:39:52,886 --> 00:39:54,284
Both.

504
00:39:54,286 --> 00:39:55,684
The could of it would require

505
00:39:55,686 --> 00:39:58,418
enormous physical
and financial resources

506
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,650
perhaps more than Germany
has at its disposal.

507
00:40:01,652 --> 00:40:04,917
But with the resources,
he could do it.

508
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,752
Yes.

509
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,851
And the would of it?

510
00:40:12,552 --> 00:40:13,984
I don't know.

511
00:40:15,052 --> 00:40:16,286
I don't know.

512
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,652
So you were friends?

513
00:40:24,654 --> 00:40:26,084
You knew him well?

514
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:28,818
Yeah.

515
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,153
Do you still
consider him a friend?

516
00:40:34,051 --> 00:40:36,852
You are a Jew, yeah, Mr. Berg?

517
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,853
Jewish.

518
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,984
A... after the Nazis
occupied Holland

519
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:46,350
my parents were taken
to Auschwitz.

520
00:40:46,352 --> 00:40:50,117
Now, I contacted Heisenberg
and I asked him

521
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:53,719
I... begged him
to do what he could.

522
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,885
And we haven't spoken since.

523
00:40:59,653 --> 00:41:01,986
I don't know
if they're dead or alive.

524
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:16,216
<i>Thanks.</i>

525
00:41:29,919 --> 00:41:31,817
I'm not comfortable with this.

526
00:41:31,819 --> 00:41:33,317
We'll be alright.

527
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:35,882
What if there are Germans
waiting for us?

528
00:41:35,884 --> 00:41:38,916
Then we'll probably
get shot and killed.

529
00:41:38,918 --> 00:41:41,515
This has all the
variables of a disaster.

530
00:41:41,517 --> 00:41:45,084
Sam, stop your whining.

531
00:41:57,452 --> 00:41:58,517
- Ah-ha.
- Here we are.

532
00:41:59,653 --> 00:42:01,485
Welcome to Italy, sir.

533
00:42:12,517 --> 00:42:14,017
Be careful!

534
00:42:38,985 --> 00:42:41,649
You doing alright?

535
00:42:41,651 --> 00:42:43,449
- You don't look so great.
- Nah..

536
00:42:43,451 --> 00:42:45,217
Quite well, thank you.

537
00:42:52,784 --> 00:42:54,050
Who the hell are you?

538
00:42:56,385 --> 00:42:58,482
- What's up there?
- Goddamn Germans.

539
00:42:58,484 --> 00:43:00,681
Left the rearguard division.

540
00:43:00,683 --> 00:43:02,116
Paying for every inch.

541
00:43:03,919 --> 00:43:06,048
What's the safest way
to Piazza Leone?

542
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,383
Why don't you drive
south 30 miles

543
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:10,551
find yourself a nice hotel,
wait a week?

544
00:43:10,553 --> 00:43:12,950
We can't wait.

545
00:43:12,952 --> 00:43:14,916
Alright, fine. Your call.

546
00:43:14,918 --> 00:43:17,382
Look, stay on the Via Appia
as long as you can.

547
00:43:17,384 --> 00:43:19,416
Stash your Jeep
when it gets too messy.

548
00:43:19,418 --> 00:43:20,750
But as of this morning
that whole area

549
00:43:20,752 --> 00:43:23,015
was crawling with Krauts.

550
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,582
- And good luck.
- Thanks.

551
00:43:25,584 --> 00:43:27,017
Alright, let them through.

552
00:43:27,019 --> 00:43:28,084
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

553
00:43:59,051 --> 00:44:01,216
Follow me and stay down.

554
00:44:01,218 --> 00:44:02,583
Duck.

555
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,781
There's still
Krauts everywhere.

556
00:44:11,783 --> 00:44:13,049
Ready? Move out.

557
00:44:13,051 --> 00:44:14,915
Yeah, come on.

558
00:44:52,452 --> 00:44:54,482
So you're the guys
they told us about.

559
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:55,749
You guys are crazy.

560
00:44:55,751 --> 00:44:57,249
Yeah.

561
00:44:57,251 --> 00:44:58,516
Alright, let's move out.

562
00:44:59,351 --> 00:45:00,816
Go, go, go.

563
00:45:03,184 --> 00:45:05,549
Look at me. We'll be alright.
Alright?

564
00:45:23,016 --> 00:45:24,281
Get down!

565
00:45:25,417 --> 00:45:26,650
Get down!

566
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:37,482
Get ready to run
to that wall.

567
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:38,648
Wait till I call.

568
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:42,315
Okay, go!

569
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:05,649
<i>Get down! Get down!</i>

570
00:46:29,148 --> 00:46:31,747
- Grenade!
- <i>Go, go, go!</i>

571
00:46:31,749 --> 00:46:33,915
- <i>Get down!</i>
- Aah!

572
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:35,114
Go, go, go, go!

573
00:46:48,017 --> 00:46:49,283
Uh, come on.

574
00:47:00,082 --> 00:47:01,749
<i>Panzer! Panzer!</i>

575
00:47:10,351 --> 00:47:12,181
- Move out!
- Get up! Move!

576
00:47:12,183 --> 00:47:13,381
- Let's go.
- <i>Whoo!</i>

577
00:47:16,117 --> 00:47:17,850
Move! Move! Move!

578
00:47:30,749 --> 00:47:32,513
- Aah!
- Move out!

579
00:47:53,382 --> 00:47:55,213
<i>Roll, roll, roll!</i>

580
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:06,980
No, uh.. Uh, that's Amaldi's.

581
00:48:06,982 --> 00:48:08,248
<i>Upper floor.</i>

582
00:48:10,448 --> 00:48:11,680
Behind me.

583
00:48:23,049 --> 00:48:24,848
We got to go.

584
00:48:27,414 --> 00:48:29,348
- Go, go.
- Yeah?

585
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:31,113
- Wait, get back.
- Yeah!

586
00:48:37,049 --> 00:48:38,914
Let's go.

587
00:49:01,281 --> 00:49:02,647
Go! Go!

588
00:49:15,681 --> 00:49:17,214
Shit.

589
00:49:26,148 --> 00:49:27,381
<i>Gracias.</i>

590
00:49:28,717 --> 00:49:30,212
Halt!

591
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:42,414
You okay?

592
00:49:43,282 --> 00:49:44,713
You're good, come on.

593
00:49:47,081 --> 00:49:48,681
Hold position!

594
00:49:51,815 --> 00:49:54,511
It looks like we've got
the city up past the Vatican.

595
00:49:54,513 --> 00:49:57,044
The Germans have pulled back
their rearguard.

596
00:50:10,513 --> 00:50:12,312
- Alright, alright.
- Thank you.

597
00:50:12,314 --> 00:50:13,513
<i>You'll be fine, buddy.</i>

598
00:52:14,781 --> 00:52:16,478
They don't have it,
they're still building

599
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,711
carbon molding frames
instead of shaped housings.

600
00:52:19,713 --> 00:52:22,245
He's writing about heavy water
absorption rates.

601
00:52:22,247 --> 00:52:23,745
This letter,
he asks Amaldi for help

602
00:52:23,747 --> 00:52:25,744
with casement tolerances.

603
00:52:25,746 --> 00:52:27,179
Here, he says
he's doing

604
00:52:27,181 --> 00:52:29,844
large-structure analysis.

605
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:32,713
Everything points to a reactor
instead of a bomb.

606
00:52:32,715 --> 00:52:35,410
How do we know
these documents aren't decoys?

607
00:52:35,412 --> 00:52:37,111
Plants?

608
00:52:37,113 --> 00:52:39,346
Uh, they're letters.

609
00:52:39,348 --> 00:52:42,077
Personal letters.
These men are friends.

610
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,679
The physics is, uh,
intertwined with the intimacy.

611
00:52:45,681 --> 00:52:48,746
Hmm, we have to be sure.

612
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:51,578
Then have the British review it.
They are physicists.

613
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,143
They will confirm what I say.

614
00:52:53,145 --> 00:52:54,877
Alright.

615
00:52:54,879 --> 00:52:57,343
We'll have
the Brits weigh in.

616
00:52:57,345 --> 00:52:59,010
Donovan will be here soon.

617
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:00,510
I'm kicking this upstairs.

618
00:53:21,478 --> 00:53:23,043
- Mr. Berg.
- Hello, sir.

619
00:53:23,045 --> 00:53:24,712
- How's it been going?
- Going well. Yes, sir.

620
00:53:30,747 --> 00:53:32,745
And the industrial complex
at Hechingen

621
00:53:32,747 --> 00:53:34,678
has only a containment vessel

622
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,011
and a cycle stack

623
00:53:36,013 --> 00:53:38,610
both signs of a nascent
reactor facility.

624
00:53:38,612 --> 00:53:41,179
And the uranium
separation facility?

625
00:53:41,181 --> 00:53:42,576
Consensus in London is

626
00:53:42,578 --> 00:53:44,712
that's just a carbon separator
of some sort.

627
00:53:44,714 --> 00:53:46,377
An attempt at shale
extraction.

628
00:53:46,379 --> 00:53:48,142
- <i>Coal?</i>
- Apparently so.

629
00:53:48,144 --> 00:53:49,678
I concur.

630
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,645
So, where does this leave us?

631
00:53:51,647 --> 00:53:53,345
London is certain.

632
00:53:53,347 --> 00:53:54,976
No German bomb.

633
00:53:54,978 --> 00:53:57,811
<i>Degree of certainty?</i>

634
00:53:57,813 --> 00:53:59,943
There's no such thing
as a degree of certainty.

635
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:03,210
I mean, something is
either certain or it is not.

636
00:54:03,212 --> 00:54:04,611
<i>Hmm.</i>

637
00:54:04,613 --> 00:54:07,277
<i>Thank you, gentlemen.</i>

638
00:54:07,279 --> 00:54:09,711
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

639
00:54:17,678 --> 00:54:19,044
So, what are the alternatives?

640
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,513
Bombing Hechingen
is unlikely to be effective.

641
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:26,945
If they are developing a bomb

642
00:54:26,947 --> 00:54:29,044
the work, the materials
will be spread out

643
00:54:29,046 --> 00:54:31,077
at facilities
and other factories.

644
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:34,777
So our British allies
tell us 100% no German bomb.

645
00:54:34,779 --> 00:54:36,877
My people tell me
a 20% possibility.

646
00:54:36,879 --> 00:54:38,875
More likely ten or
five percent.

647
00:54:38,877 --> 00:54:40,677
- Perhaps less.
- <i>But not zero.</i>

648
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:42,843
It's Probability 101.

649
00:54:42,845 --> 00:54:45,743
You multiply the likelihood of
the event by the consequence.

650
00:54:45,745 --> 00:54:46,812
Five percent chance you're

651
00:54:46,814 --> 00:54:48,444
going to stub your toe in the
dark

652
00:54:48,446 --> 00:54:49,844
you take the chance,
walk to the bathroom

653
00:54:49,846 --> 00:54:51,943
without turning on the lights
and waking your wife.

654
00:54:51,945 --> 00:54:55,775
A five percent chance of losingthe
war to a weapon like this

655
00:54:55,777 --> 00:54:58,542
you do what has to be done.

656
00:54:58,544 --> 00:55:00,845
Which is?

657
00:55:00,847 --> 00:55:02,979
We kill Heisenberg.

658
00:55:07,645 --> 00:55:09,578
What if he's on our side?

659
00:55:11,246 --> 00:55:14,877
Why is it that the Germans
haven't developed a bomb?

660
00:55:14,879 --> 00:55:16,310
Heisenberg has a team of
at least

661
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:18,542
a dozen capable physicists.

662
00:55:18,544 --> 00:55:19,910
What have they been doing?

663
00:55:19,912 --> 00:55:22,843
What are you saying?
He's dragging his feet?

664
00:55:22,845 --> 00:55:24,543
Intentionally slowing
the program?

665
00:55:24,545 --> 00:55:26,545
I do not think
that Werner Heisenberg

666
00:55:26,547 --> 00:55:29,475
would want to be remembered
as a traitor.

667
00:55:29,477 --> 00:55:31,477
The man who lost the war
for Germany?

668
00:55:31,479 --> 00:55:33,109
We are not absolutely
sure of that

669
00:55:33,111 --> 00:55:34,777
nor do we have
any actual evidence

670
00:55:34,779 --> 00:55:36,076
that he's secretly
working for us.

671
00:55:36,078 --> 00:55:38,177
There are millions of lives
at stake.

672
00:55:38,179 --> 00:55:39,677
I'm sorry.

673
00:55:46,245 --> 00:55:48,344
<i>Werner Heisenberg..</i>

674
00:55:48,346 --> 00:55:51,112
<i>Pioneer in the study
of subatomic particles.</i>

675
00:55:52,811 --> 00:55:55,642
<i>Winner of the 1932
Nobel Prize in physics</i>

676
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:58,278
<i>for the creation
of quantum mechanics.</i>

677
00:56:02,511 --> 00:56:04,208
<i>Equation 56 is known</i>

678
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:07,075
<i>as Heisenberg's principle
of uncertainty.</i>

679
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:10,910
<i>The principle shows
that one can never observe</i>

680
00:56:10,912 --> 00:56:13,444
<i>both the position
and velocity of a particle</i>

681
00:56:13,446 --> 00:56:15,279
<i>at the same time.</i>

682
00:56:16,878 --> 00:56:18,775
<i>One cannot be certain
where something is</i>

683
00:56:18,777 --> 00:56:20,710
<i>and where it is going.</i>

684
00:56:23,945 --> 00:56:27,410
<i>And thus, Heisenberg proves
that no one knows anything.</i>

685
00:56:29,745 --> 00:56:32,178
<i>We live in eternal
uncertainty.</i>

686
00:56:35,378 --> 00:56:37,344
<i>A man after my own heart.</i>

687
00:56:51,311 --> 00:56:54,409
You like libraries.

688
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:55,776
Why?

689
00:56:56,810 --> 00:57:00,042
Here is a belongingness

690
00:57:00,044 --> 00:57:02,076
I find in few other places.

691
00:57:03,844 --> 00:57:06,108
On a ball field?

692
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:07,309
There too.

693
00:57:08,845 --> 00:57:11,108
That's gone now.

694
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:12,641
I have to ask you
a question

695
00:57:12,643 --> 00:57:14,310
and I need a real answer.

696
00:57:15,911 --> 00:57:18,608
If it comes down to it

697
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:20,910
are you going to be able
to kill him?

698
00:57:24,111 --> 00:57:25,210
Yes.

699
00:57:32,511 --> 00:57:34,043
<i>There you go.</i>

700
00:57:38,845 --> 00:57:40,377
You wanna play?

701
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:44,244
Huh, good.
You, uh, got a choice?

702
00:57:46,677 --> 00:57:48,943
- Catcher?
- It's all yours.

703
00:58:06,744 --> 00:58:09,342
Oh, shit.

704
00:58:09,344 --> 00:58:11,944
- The guy's a pro.
- Yeah.

705
00:58:26,543 --> 00:58:27,842
I know who that is.

706
00:58:29,279 --> 00:58:30,511
That's Moe Berg.

707
00:58:36,811 --> 00:58:39,609
<i>Home plate, home plate!</i>

708
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:44,442
- Yes!
- Alright.

709
00:58:52,642 --> 00:58:55,475
Uh-oh. Move back, move back.

710
00:58:55,477 --> 00:58:58,307
Don't worry,
245 lifetime.

711
00:58:58,309 --> 00:59:01,308
Yeah, yeah, just don't hit it
down my throat, okay?

712
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:06,408
<i>Oh!</i>

713
00:59:10,243 --> 00:59:11,942
<i>That's a hit!</i>

714
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:21,274
Jesus Christ!

715
00:59:21,276 --> 00:59:22,875
Moe Berg, thanks.

716
00:59:22,877 --> 00:59:25,810
Oh, no. Don't thank me.
Thank you.

717
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:28,076
Hey, do you mind,
uh, signing the ball?

718
00:59:28,078 --> 00:59:30,274
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks a lot, Moe.

719
00:59:30,276 --> 00:59:32,041
You know, I saw you
a dozen times at Fenway.

720
00:59:32,043 --> 00:59:35,541
- You were great.
- Me? Great? When?

721
00:59:35,543 --> 00:59:37,772
Uh, well, I saw you.

722
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:41,074
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

723
00:59:56,043 --> 00:59:59,509
Zurich. It's a short train
journey from Hechingen.

724
00:59:59,511 --> 01:00:02,674
A break from the grim
atmosphere of Germany.

725
01:00:02,676 --> 01:00:04,207
He will be tempted.

726
01:00:04,209 --> 01:00:06,008
And I know someone in Zurich.

727
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:07,841
Paul Scherrer.

728
01:00:07,843 --> 01:00:09,239
He and Heisenberg
are good friends.

729
01:00:09,241 --> 01:00:12,106
- They play chess by mail.
- He's anti-Nazi.

730
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,840
Exactly, but he and Heisenberg
are still close.

731
01:00:14,842 --> 01:00:16,739
And he gonna help us
lure Heisenberg to Zurich?

732
01:00:16,741 --> 01:00:19,408
Such a word, "Lure."

733
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:23,040
Heisenberg has been there
twice since the war started.

734
01:00:23,042 --> 01:00:26,807
We simply have Scherrer invite
him to deliver a lecture.

735
01:00:26,809 --> 01:00:28,708
Can Scherrer be persuaded
to work with us?

736
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:31,376
Yes. Scherrer will arrange it.

737
01:00:37,109 --> 01:00:39,974
And so the madness
becomes real.

738
01:00:41,709 --> 01:00:43,640
We have to kill
Werner Heisenberg

739
01:00:43,642 --> 01:00:45,807
and I am to be a part of it.

740
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,807
No one wants
to kill Heisenberg.

741
01:00:47,809 --> 01:00:49,373
Yeah? Then kidnap him.

742
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:51,841
Send in spies to Germany
and kidnap him.

743
01:00:51,843 --> 01:00:54,275
You've read too many
spy novels.

744
01:00:54,277 --> 01:00:57,073
I've never read a spy novel.

745
01:00:57,075 --> 01:00:58,874
It's not that easy
to kidnap somebody.

746
01:00:58,876 --> 01:01:00,807
Ah.

747
01:01:00,809 --> 01:01:02,642
Yeah,
you mean killing is easier.

748
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:07,609
My God.

749
01:01:16,408 --> 01:01:19,407
You'll have about 30 miles
on foot to the Swiss border.

750
01:01:21,208 --> 01:01:22,541
I'd hold on to your gun.

751
01:01:22,543 --> 01:01:25,606
I have some reservations
about your guides.

752
01:01:25,608 --> 01:01:27,974
Reservations?
Like what?

753
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:30,672
Reservations like
they might kill you.

754
01:01:30,674 --> 01:01:33,408
You might have cared
to add that to the report.

755
01:01:40,608 --> 01:01:42,375
There's your guides.

756
01:01:44,975 --> 01:01:46,274
Wish me luck.

757
01:01:46,276 --> 01:01:48,341
I don't wanna hear you
depending on luck.

758
01:01:49,908 --> 01:01:51,474
Figure of speech.

759
01:01:54,608 --> 01:01:56,006
Thank you, Sam.

760
01:01:56,008 --> 01:01:57,974
Thank you, Moe.

761
01:02:48,442 --> 01:02:49,639
Now we rest.

762
01:02:50,708 --> 01:02:53,240
<i>Riposo.</i>

763
01:02:53,242 --> 01:02:54,508
No.

764
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:24,138
- Hi, are you okay?
- Yeah.

765
01:04:27,008 --> 01:04:29,506
Who came up
with that sheep nonsense?

766
01:04:29,508 --> 01:04:32,439
- I don't know.
- I felt like an idiot.

767
01:04:32,441 --> 01:04:33,606
So did I.

768
01:04:40,473 --> 01:04:41,640
Switzerland?

769
01:04:43,107 --> 01:04:45,139
Yes.

770
01:04:45,141 --> 01:04:46,607
Let's go.

771
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,840
That's Heisenberg.

772
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:21,870
It's good to see you..

773
01:05:21,872 --> 01:05:23,740
<i>And that's Professor Scherrer.</i>

774
01:05:24,973 --> 01:05:27,471
Scherrer looks way to nervous.

775
01:05:27,473 --> 01:05:29,605
I guess this isn't his thing.

776
01:05:30,574 --> 01:05:31,740
What?

777
01:05:33,007 --> 01:05:34,505
Treachery.

778
01:05:51,041 --> 01:05:53,605
- <i>Professor Scherrer.</i>
- Mr. Aziz, please come in.

779
01:05:53,607 --> 01:05:54,739
Thank you.

780
01:05:58,573 --> 01:06:00,836
My name's Berg.

781
01:06:00,838 --> 01:06:03,937
Oh, so who is Mr. Aziz?

782
01:06:03,939 --> 01:06:05,305
A cover name.

783
01:06:05,307 --> 01:06:07,338
I prefer you and I
tell each other the truth.

784
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:09,471
I'm Morris Berg.

785
01:06:09,473 --> 01:06:11,237
Oh.

786
01:06:11,239 --> 01:06:14,538
Sam Goudsmit
sends his regards.

787
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:15,505
Ah, well.

788
01:06:15,507 --> 01:06:18,804
I was hoping
he would come here personally.

789
01:06:19,907 --> 01:06:21,805
Please, please sit down.

790
01:06:21,807 --> 01:06:24,971
Well, he, uh..

791
01:06:24,973 --> 01:06:26,572
He sent you something.

792
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:33,739
Heavy water.

793
01:06:35,205 --> 01:06:37,338
Nordstemmen impurity.

794
01:06:41,306 --> 01:06:44,472
Oh, thank you so much.

795
01:06:44,474 --> 01:06:46,470
No, you don't know
how much I appreciate this.

796
01:06:46,472 --> 01:06:48,370
Thank you so much.

797
01:06:48,372 --> 01:06:50,904
You don't worry
I give this to the Germans?

798
01:06:52,038 --> 01:06:54,339
We trust you, professor.

799
01:06:57,371 --> 01:06:59,304
I may be mistaken, but..

800
01:07:01,173 --> 01:07:02,769
I don't think
Professor Heisenberg

801
01:07:02,771 --> 01:07:06,203
will reveal anything
in his lecture.

802
01:07:06,205 --> 01:07:08,337
Hmm.

803
01:07:08,339 --> 01:07:11,837
Well, then perhaps I could
speak with him privately.

804
01:07:13,006 --> 01:07:14,970
Are you hoping he'll defect?

805
01:07:14,972 --> 01:07:17,171
Yes, I am.

806
01:07:19,305 --> 01:07:20,770
Good luck.

807
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,605
Excuse me one moment.

808
01:09:10,006 --> 01:09:11,835
Got to listen carefully.

809
01:09:11,837 --> 01:09:13,369
There may be one moment
that tells you

810
01:09:13,371 --> 01:09:16,437
whether the Germans have a
chance at a fission bomb or not.

811
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:20,069
One moment, and you'll learn
all you need to know.

812
01:09:20,071 --> 01:09:21,870
You understand me, catcher?

813
01:09:23,538 --> 01:09:24,737
I understand you.

814
01:09:33,705 --> 01:09:35,936
<i>In that moment,
without hesitation</i>

815
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:38,802
you will shoot Heisenberg
dead on the spot.

816
01:10:16,737 --> 01:10:19,170
Did he accept
your dinner invitation?

817
01:10:19,172 --> 01:10:21,870
I prevailed upon our
friendship. He'll be there.

818
01:10:21,872 --> 01:10:23,236
Good.

819
01:10:23,238 --> 01:10:26,201
What if he doesn't tell you
what you want to know?

820
01:10:26,203 --> 01:10:28,636
I'll do my best
to be persuasive.

821
01:10:28,638 --> 01:10:31,735
There's always a possibility
that you will learn nothing.

822
01:10:31,737 --> 01:10:33,868
But at least
we will have tried.

823
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:35,135
Mr. Berg..

824
01:10:37,437 --> 01:10:39,934
Is there something
you're not telling me?

825
01:10:39,936 --> 01:10:42,535
No.

826
01:10:42,537 --> 01:10:45,104
Do you plan to kill
Professor Heisenberg?

827
01:10:46,672 --> 01:10:50,170
I have no intention
whatsoever.

828
01:10:50,172 --> 01:10:51,804
One last thing.

829
01:11:00,403 --> 01:11:04,169
Heisenberg will have undercover
Gestapo agents watching him

830
01:11:04,171 --> 01:11:06,738
and you can't allow yourself
to be captured.

831
01:11:15,304 --> 01:11:18,536
I don't know what God
you believe in, Berg, if any.

832
01:11:20,738 --> 01:11:23,570
But I'll be asking mine
to keep an eye on you.

833
01:13:03,936 --> 01:13:06,667
Your call is being
connected, sir.

834
01:13:06,669 --> 01:13:08,669
<i>Let me know
if there's a problem.</i>

835
01:13:25,669 --> 01:13:27,001
Hello?

836
01:13:29,536 --> 01:13:31,035
Hello?

837
01:13:34,102 --> 01:13:35,334
<i>Hello?</i>

838
01:13:37,768 --> 01:13:39,701
Hi, Estella.

839
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:45,002
<i>Morris?</i>

840
01:13:48,636 --> 01:13:50,369
<i>Are you alright?</i>

841
01:13:53,235 --> 01:13:54,969
I am.

842
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:58,301
<i>Where are you?</i>

843
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:01,835
Uh, I can't say.

844
01:14:02,803 --> 01:14:04,535
And I don't have much time.

845
01:14:05,969 --> 01:14:08,235
But I wanted to call and..

846
01:14:11,436 --> 01:14:13,435
I wanted to hear your voice.

847
01:14:19,535 --> 01:14:21,269
I'm here, Moe.

848
01:14:31,868 --> 01:14:34,002
I have to go.

849
01:14:36,803 --> 01:14:38,935
I love you.

850
01:15:27,169 --> 01:15:28,267
Thank you.

851
01:17:13,101 --> 01:17:15,166
Who is that, Paul?

852
01:17:15,168 --> 01:17:16,965
I saw him at the lecture.
What's he doing here?

853
01:17:16,967 --> 01:17:19,299
Yeah,
he's a good friend of mine.

854
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:22,130
I think you'll find him
very engaging.

855
01:17:22,132 --> 01:17:24,499
You know he carries a gun.

856
01:17:24,501 --> 01:17:26,701
Yeah.
No need to worry.

857
01:17:26,703 --> 01:17:28,434
Let's eat.

858
01:17:48,401 --> 01:17:52,532
I just don't understand how you
could have stayed in Germany.

859
01:17:52,534 --> 01:17:55,433
Oh, please, no politics.

860
01:17:55,435 --> 01:17:56,532
No war.

861
01:17:56,534 --> 01:17:59,066
There is a war,
whether you like it or not.

862
01:17:59,068 --> 01:18:01,330
What are you suggesting?
I like the war?

863
01:18:01,332 --> 01:18:04,031
I am suggesting that unlike
many of your colleagues

864
01:18:04,033 --> 01:18:07,130
you elected to stay
in Nazi Germany.

865
01:18:07,132 --> 01:18:11,432
I elected to stay in Germany,
which happens to be Nazi.

866
01:18:11,434 --> 01:18:14,732
Do I hear politics
from that end of the table?

867
01:18:14,734 --> 01:18:17,032
One hears what one
wishes to hear.

868
01:18:17,034 --> 01:18:19,064
Please, we are all friends.

869
01:18:19,066 --> 01:18:22,032
Let's talk about old times,
or better times to come.

870
01:18:22,034 --> 01:18:23,665
Yes, please.

871
01:19:14,832 --> 01:19:16,764
Aziz?

872
01:19:16,766 --> 01:19:18,300
Aziz.

873
01:19:24,099 --> 01:19:27,963
I understand we have a
bad weather tomorrow.

874
01:19:27,965 --> 01:19:29,531
Rain.

875
01:19:35,298 --> 01:19:37,996
There is no avoiding
political matters.

876
01:19:37,998 --> 01:19:39,398
We can try.

877
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,698
Is that what you've been doing

878
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,363
as the head of
the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute

879
01:19:43,365 --> 01:19:45,130
<i>and the Heereswaffenamt?</i>

880
01:19:45,132 --> 01:19:47,865
I beg of you, we are completely
separate from politics.

881
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:49,130
Oh, I forgot.

882
01:19:49,132 --> 01:19:51,197
The citizens
of the world, yes?

883
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:54,196
Once, and hopefully again
someday.

884
01:19:54,198 --> 01:19:57,065
<i>Tell that to the Poles,
and the Danes</i>

885
01:19:57,067 --> 01:19:58,498
the Belgians, the Jews.

886
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:01,963
Please,
I'm not a military man.

887
01:20:01,965 --> 01:20:03,097
We don't know
what sort of man you are.

888
01:20:03,099 --> 01:20:04,597
Yes, we do.

889
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:06,596
He's the kind of man
who is helping the Nazis

890
01:20:06,598 --> 01:20:07,898
fight their war.

891
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:09,665
Building Hitler's super
weapon.

892
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:14,734
See?
He doesn't even deny it.

893
01:20:17,298 --> 01:20:20,031
<i>I feel the war
will be over soon.</i>

894
01:20:20,033 --> 01:20:21,497
<i>Maybe.</i>

895
01:20:21,499 --> 01:20:24,864
- And Germany will lose.
- Whatever you say.

896
01:20:26,132 --> 01:20:27,565
You disgust me.

897
01:20:27,567 --> 01:20:30,065
Please, please, please.

898
01:20:30,067 --> 01:20:32,396
Professor Heisenberg
is my guest.

899
01:20:32,398 --> 01:20:35,931
Well, then the two of you can
lament Germany's loss together.

900
01:20:35,933 --> 01:20:37,232
Ugh!

901
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,463
Please forgive me.

902
01:20:44,666 --> 01:20:47,097
Werner, please stay.

903
01:20:47,099 --> 01:20:49,531
I really must go.
I've endured enough of this.

904
01:22:29,699 --> 01:22:31,631
Do I have a choice?

905
01:22:33,565 --> 01:22:34,830
Yes, of course.

906
01:22:36,333 --> 01:22:38,833
Should I run, perhaps?

907
01:22:41,198 --> 01:22:42,697
I wouldn't recommend it.

908
01:22:51,398 --> 01:22:53,531
We must finish our game.

909
01:22:56,197 --> 01:22:58,831
I believe it's your move,
professor.

910
01:23:02,831 --> 01:23:05,632
- Knight takes rook.
- Bishop takes bishop.

911
01:23:06,431 --> 01:23:08,563
Pawn takes knight.

912
01:23:10,231 --> 01:23:13,162
And so,
in three exchanges

913
01:23:13,164 --> 01:23:14,896
only my king will survive.

914
01:23:18,699 --> 01:23:21,196
It seems to me

915
01:23:21,198 --> 01:23:22,931
this game is nearly over.

916
01:23:24,765 --> 01:23:28,395
I cannot mount an attack
with my king.

917
01:23:28,397 --> 01:23:30,296
So it is over.

918
01:24:05,364 --> 01:24:07,030
Who are you?

919
01:24:08,229 --> 01:24:09,796
A student.

920
01:24:09,798 --> 01:24:12,398
A student? Really?
A student of what?

921
01:24:13,930 --> 01:24:15,329
Of you.

922
01:24:18,231 --> 01:24:19,530
I see.

923
01:24:25,698 --> 01:24:28,295
Now, how are we supposed to
ascertain the truth here

924
01:24:28,297 --> 01:24:30,094
Mr. Berg?

925
01:24:30,096 --> 01:24:31,894
Will Germany lose the war?

926
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:35,396
Is this really a secret?

927
01:24:37,963 --> 01:24:39,729
I'll ask him myself.

928
01:24:40,764 --> 01:24:42,998
I think you mean,
am I a traitor?

929
01:24:44,531 --> 01:24:46,562
Is that what you wish to know?

930
01:24:46,564 --> 01:24:48,696
And if I think he's lying..

931
01:24:50,464 --> 01:24:52,397
...then I'll kill him.

932
01:24:55,396 --> 01:24:57,129
Like me..

933
01:24:58,562 --> 01:25:00,762
...you are free to choose.

934
01:25:10,364 --> 01:25:11,829
Your move.

935
01:25:28,263 --> 01:25:30,029
<i>Goodnight,
Professor Heisenberg.</i>

936
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:40,863
<i>What did you say
your name was?</i>

937
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:47,029
I didn't.
