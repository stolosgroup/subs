3
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,750
No!

4
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,208
I can't run! My legs hurt!

5
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,875
I can't wait till we're older.

6
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,916
We can leave this place.

7
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,250
Where do you want to go?

8
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,708
Just somewhere different.

9
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,333
Somewhere where
the sun's always shining.

10
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,250
Like today.

11
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,833
California.

12
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,916
Let's go.

13
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,541
Really?

14
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,041
Promise you won't
go without me?

15
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,375
Of course.

16
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,333
It's friends
till the end, right?

17
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,125
Friends to the end.

18
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,207
- Bam.
- Oh!

19
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,625
Kevin, hurry up!
We have to go to the game!

20
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,416
Come on!

21
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,957
Kevin?

22
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:25,707
Kevin?

23
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,541
Kevin!

24
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,125
Kevin?

25
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,666
Kevin!

26
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,250
Okay, Kevin, this...

27
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,375
this, uh... this isn't funny.

28
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,250
Kevin?

29
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,250
Augh!

30
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,125
No! No!

31
00:06:50,832 --> 00:06:53,166
[Door slams

32
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,875
Gah!

33
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,957
Gah!

34
00:07:32,082 --> 00:07:33,041
Help!

35
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,291
Somebody, please! Help!

36
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,500
Help... Help!

37
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,582
Help, please!

38
00:08:16,707 --> 00:08:18,291
Somebody, help! Please!

39
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,082
Guh! Help!

40
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,916
Help me...

41
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,208
Guh!

42
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,750
Help!

43
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,041
Help me!

44
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,291
Help! Help!

45
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,208
Please, stop!

46
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,791
Somebody get me out of here!

47
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,083
Please!

48
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,583
Help!

49
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,290
Help! Please!

50
00:10:37,415 --> 00:10:41,208
Stop! Help, please!

51
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,958
Help!

52
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,000
But we have to try with all
the help we can get.

53
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,458
Now, I'm going to point out
the windows and doors.

54
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,125
Do you understand?
We'll be all right here.

55
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,333
We'll be all right here
if someone comes to rest,

56
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,415
but we'll have to
work together.

57
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,958
You'll have to help.

58
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,290
Now, I want you to go in
and get some wood

59
00:11:50,415 --> 00:11:51,540
so I can board the place up.

60
00:11:51,665 --> 00:11:54,708
Do you understand? Okay?

61
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,125
Okay?

62
00:14:55,415 --> 00:14:59,000
Shhhhh.

63
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,708
Don't cry.

64
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,833
There's nothing to cry about.

65
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,333
It's okay.

66
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,665
Shh, you're safe here.

67
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,665
You are.

68
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,290
Hey.

69
00:17:11,415 --> 00:17:13,500
What's going on?

70
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,958
What's wrong?

71
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,750
Come on,
don't do that.

72
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,708
Do not cry.

73
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,750
Stop now.

74
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,875
What was that?

75
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,375
It's okay.

76
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,750
You don't have to hide from me.

77
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,541
I just want to talk.

78
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,500
I'm not gonna hurt you.

79
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,291
Don't be shy, now.

80
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,125
You can come out.

81
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,833
It's okay.

82
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,083
- Rrgh!
- Ough!

83
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:52,000
Ugh!

84
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,208
Guh...

85
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,833
Come on, come on, come on!

86
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,500
Ugh!

87
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,416
There you are.

88
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,125
He... Help me!
Help me, please!

89
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,333
Shh, shh!

90
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,583
Stop that.
There's nothing to be scared of.

91
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,625
I just want to talk.
That's all I want to do.

92
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,125
Calm down.

93
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,708
It's okay.

94
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,333
That wasn't very nice, was that?

95
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,166
What are you gonna
do with that?

96
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,000
What are you gonna
do with that?

97
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,458
Hmm?

98
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,625
I need you to listen to me.

99
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,458
Be a good boy
and put the knife down.

100
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,833
Mnngh.

101
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,791
I'm sorry.

102
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,041
I said... Rgh!

103
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,333
Ugh!

104
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,625
Ugh...

105
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,666
I'm sorry.

106
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,416
Kevin.

107
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,916
Kevin, can you hear me?
It's me, Bobby.

108
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,500
Kevin, please answer me!

109
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,916
Can you hear me?

110
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,083
Kevin.

111
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,250
Bobby.

112
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:28,625
Kevin?

113
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,791
Kevin, are you okay?

114
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:34,041
Did he hurt you?

115
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:36,750
No, I'm fine.

116
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:40,375
Where is he?

117
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,000
H-He's gone.

118
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:50,041
What about the other one?

119
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:52,375
I-I don't know.

120
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,083
Can you come to the door?

121
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:58,583
No, he put something around
my ankle, and I can't move.

122
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,916
I'm scared, Bobby.

123
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:10,125
Me, too, okay?

124
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,625
But I'm not gonna leave you.

125
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,541
It's it's friends
till the end, remember?

126
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:16,625
Friends to the end.

127
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:20,791
Don't worry,
I'm gonna find keys.

128
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:18,291
Aw, come on.

129
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,625
Bobby?

130
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:28,958
Bobby.

131
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:14,333
Hey, I'm gonna drive
and get help.

132
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,541
- What do you mean?
- I can't find the keys.

133
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:19,208
Yeah, but you can't drive.

134
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,541
I-I'll be right back.

135
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:22,916
- Bobby!
- Just trust me!

136
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:47,833
A-And that's the thing...

137
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,458
these aren't law-abiding
Americans.

138
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:50,958
These aren't good people.

139
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:52,833
These are rapists.
These are criminals.

140
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:54,791
Now, I'll tell you something...
they're coming for you.

141
00:27:54,916 --> 00:27:56,291
They're coming for your jobs.

142
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:59,000
They're coming for your women.

143
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:00,750
Whoa. Whoa!

144
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:02,125
They take and take
till they...

145
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,083
No-no-no-no-no.

146
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:09,000
- Come on!
- They want to take your guns.

147
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:10,875
No, no, no.

148
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,750
No! Come on!

149
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:18,583
Augh!

150
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,333
Kevin, I need you.

151
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:37,916
Bobby, do you find help?

152
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:39,291
I found a phone.

153
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:41,333
It's like the ones
you see in movies.

154
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:42,833
It's big, heavy.

155
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:44,875
It has a curly cord thing.

156
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,541
Oh, my grandma
has one of those.

157
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:47,708
I-I don't know how it works.

158
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:49,333
You need to plug it
into a wall.

159
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:50,708
It doesn't have a plug.

160
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:53,333
Well, t-t-there should be
some cord around,

161
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:55,833
and it ...it looks like
an Internet cable.

162
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:23,083
Dang it.

163
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:30,208
Come on, come on, come on.

164
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:32,041
Agh!

165
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:33,375
Ugh!

166
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:50,708
Yes!

167
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:52,208
Kevin, it's working!

168
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,208
911, what's your emergency?

169
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:46,500
Yeah, w... M-Me and my friend
have been kidnapped.

170
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:48,416
What's your name, sir?

171
00:32:48,541 --> 00:32:50,666
- Bobby. Bobby Green.
- Okay, Bobby.

172
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:52,458
Is the person that took you
still there?

173
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:54,250
- Can they hear you?
- N-No, they're gone.

174
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:55,500
but my friend's still stuck.

175
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:56,666
You have to hurry, please.

176
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:03,333
We're tracking your location.

177
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:04,666
Can you tell me anything
about where you are?

178
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:07,041
- It's a house.
- Okay, a house.

179
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:08,375
Do you know where it is?

180
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,958
There's a lot
of grass and trees

181
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:12,083
and a big oil rig out front.

182
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,125
Oh!

183
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,291
Ooh!

184
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:28,958
Oh...

185
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,333
Bobby, hide!

186
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:39,541
...see anything else...

187
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:46,333
No.

188
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:49,500
He... He's back.
He just came back.

189
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:51,500
You have to hurry, please.

190
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:53,750
We'll... We'll be there soon.
Just stay on the line.

191
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:55,125
We almost have your location.

192
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,708
Just stay with me
a little longer.

193
00:33:56,833 --> 00:33:58,625
No, I have to go.

194
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,083
Is there a place you can hide?

195
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:02,291
N-No! No, he'll find me!

196
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,291
He'll see me!
He'll see the body, okay?

197
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,541
- Bobby, talk to me.
- I have to go.

198
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:33,541
Do you really think...

199
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:35,291
I don't think anything.

200
00:34:35,416 --> 00:34:37,208
I just know that
I'm going to my room.

201
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:40,208
And if anybody comes in,
I'll shoot him.

202
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:41,250
Or her.

203
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,000
O-Ow!

204
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:04,666
Okay.

205
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:08,791
Augh...

206
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:03,375
Oh, I wish
this night were over.

207
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:07,708
Those are guns.

208
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:13,458
I tell you, it doesn't make
any difference.

209
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:15,541
They're not through
with us yet.

210
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,125
Mnngh...

211
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:48,875
Rrghh!

212
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:07,125
Rgh.

213
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,291
Certainly not.

214
00:39:22,416 --> 00:39:23,750
And right as somebody else
in this house

215
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:25,708
who once has left his room.

216
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:27,666
Did you hear anything?

217
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:28,958
Organ music.

218
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:31,666
That and someone walking.

219
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:34,791
You look downstairs,
and I'll look out here.

220
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:36,666
Why not together?

221
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,000
There may be only minutes,
seconds left of someone's life!

222
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:42,708
Why waste time?

223
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:05,083
It's almost over, Nelly.

224
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:09,291
You really keep
the hours passing.

225
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:13,541
What's happening?

226
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:14,875
We've done it.

227
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
A perfect crime.

228
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,041
Beautiful.

229
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,625
Ahh...

230
00:46:46,208 --> 00:46:47,791
What are you doing?

231
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:49,500
What is that?

232
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:52,666
Please!

233
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:54,750
I just want to go home!

234
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:55,833
Please.

235
00:46:55,958 --> 00:46:57,791
I won't cry, I swear.

236
00:46:57,916 --> 00:46:58,958
I swear.

237
00:47:00,291 --> 00:47:01,375
Ple... Please don't!

238
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,875
Please! Please!

239
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:00,541
Gah!

240
00:48:04,083 --> 00:48:05,375
Get away!

241
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,416
Please, go away!

242
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:14,083
Just go away!

243
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:18,250
Why?!

244
00:48:20,041 --> 00:48:22,208
Please, stop!

245
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:27,083
Augh!

246
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:09,833
Help! Help! I'm up here!

247
00:49:09,958 --> 00:49:11,958
Please! Hello?! Please!

248
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:13,041
Up here at the window!

249
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:15,208
Please! Hello?!

250
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:17,416
It's me! It's me up here!

251
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:19,958
Up here at the window! Please!

252
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:21,708
Hello?! Please!

253
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,500
Please, I'm up here!

254
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:25,375
Help me, please!

255
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:31,458
Help, please!

256
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:33,625
I'm up here! Help!

257
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:44,166
There is a pattern
to all that lives!

258
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:46,333
An order, an arrangement!

259
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:50,583
She had a heart, and a brain,
and her spirit was in both!

260
00:49:50,708 --> 00:49:51,791
Not in one or the other!

261
00:49:51,916 --> 00:49:53,166
No.

262
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,208
I'll give her a brain
and a heart.

263
00:49:56,333 --> 00:50:00,291
Yes, and what of her soul?

264
00:50:00,416 --> 00:50:02,791
You say you love her and...

265
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,458
You can remember
her love for you.

266
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:10,083
Then how can you make of her
an experiment of horror?

267
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:13,750
All the skill and
science I possess was meant for this.

268
00:50:13,875 --> 00:50:16,500
Life has a pattern.

269
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:18,458
The whole pattern of my life
is shaping itself

270
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:20,708
to save her now.

271
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:22,250
Then, you intend to
go through with it?

272
00:50:22,375 --> 00:50:24,083
Yes.

273
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:25,916
Good evening.

274
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:27,916
Are you the owner
of this residence?

275
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:29,875
Yes, I am.

276
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,583
Can you cut that down?

277
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:37,750
I'm sorry.

278
00:50:38,833 --> 00:50:40,583
Are you the owner
of this residence?

279
00:50:40,708 --> 00:50:42,666
Yes. Yes, I am.

280
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:45,083
Um...

281
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,416
m-may I ask what this is about?

282
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:50,375
We received a distress call
about a suspected kidnapping.

283
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,958
Dispatch traced it
to this general area.

284
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,166
Oh, my God. You're kidding.

285
00:50:56,291 --> 00:50:57,500
In this area?

286
00:50:57,625 --> 00:51:00,250
Have you seen anything
unusual tonight?

287
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:01,708
No, no.

288
00:51:01,833 --> 00:51:06,166
It's just another
quiet night around here.

289
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:08,583
W... Except for the TV,
of course.

290
00:51:08,708 --> 00:51:12,041
It's just nice to hear
something in the background.

291
00:51:12,166 --> 00:51:14,291
Mm. Do you have
any kids, Miss...?

292
00:51:14,416 --> 00:51:17,041
Burton. Uh, no.

293
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:18,750
No kids.

294
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:22,791
What about a Mr. Burton?

295
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:28,583
Are you making a pass
at me, Officer?

296
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:31,458
No, ma'am, I'm not.

297
00:51:34,416 --> 00:51:36,041
It's just me.

298
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:48,000
Can I see some I.D.,
Miss Burton?

299
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:51,416
Of course.

300
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:53,958
It's, uh, just right inside.

301
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:55,583
I'll be back in a minute.

302
00:52:23,791 --> 00:52:25,166
Ms. Burton!

303
00:52:28,166 --> 00:52:30,583
Miss Burton, can you
hurry this up, please?

304
00:52:35,916 --> 00:52:37,750
Ms. Burton, I'm comin' in!

305
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:46,500
People fear what
they don't understand.

306
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:48,458
And what they can't see.

307
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:52,083
- Ms. Burton!
- No, what are you talking about?

308
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:55,250
You're nothing a freak of life.

309
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:57,875
And a freak of death!

310
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,083
Why should I be afraid of a few locks on the door?

311
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:03,083
But last night, you ran.

312
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:15,791
Hello?

313
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:38,375
Ms. Burton?

314
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,083
Help us!

315
00:53:52,208 --> 00:53:53,541
Oh, my God.

316
00:53:54,375 --> 00:53:56,208
Gah!

317
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,208
No!

318
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,291
Ah...

319
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:15,375
Ungh.

320
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:13,250
Open the door, kid.

321
00:55:16,083 --> 00:55:20,333
Open... the goddamn... door.

322
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,500
Okay, listen to me.

323
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:28,958
I know you're scared,

324
00:55:29,083 --> 00:55:30,666
but I'm coming in there
one way or another.

325
00:55:30,791 --> 00:55:32,041
So, if you open the door,

326
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:35,708
I promise you,
I will not hurt you.

327
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,083
Do it!

328
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:43,125
Let me in.

329
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:45,416
Come on!

330
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:46,375
Open the door!

331
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,458
Open the goddamn door!

332
00:55:49,583 --> 00:55:52,458
Open the door, bitch!

333
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:54,458
Fuck it!

334
00:57:49,916 --> 00:57:53,875
You know, I never really planned
on taking you out of that trunk.

335
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,583
I figured you'd
suck all the air out

336
00:57:55,708 --> 00:57:58,541
and that'd be the end of it.

337
00:57:58,666 --> 00:58:00,916
But, here we are.

338
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:16,833
My friends like
tough boys, though.

339
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:20,708
Not like your crybaby
buddy upstairs.

340
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:25,166
They actually pay good money
for the ones who put up a fight.

341
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:41,291
They don't normally go for ones
who look like you,

342
00:58:41,416 --> 00:58:43,666
but I think
they'll make an exception.

343
00:58:48,916 --> 00:58:50,833
You know what?

344
00:58:50,958 --> 00:58:54,541
Since you clearly like
your little fucking friend,

345
00:58:54,666 --> 00:58:57,958
how about I swap you out
for your pal?

346
00:58:58,083 --> 00:59:00,791
How does that sound?

347
00:59:00,916 --> 00:59:02,958
Ugh! Augh!

348
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:21,500
Ngh!

349
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:31,041
Oh, fuck!

350
00:59:35,291 --> 00:59:36,500
God damn it.

351
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:47,625
Rrgh!

352
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:22,041
Kevin.

353
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:26,291
Kevin.

354
01:03:26,416 --> 01:03:28,166
Kevin.

355
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:29,791
Get away from me!

356
01:03:29,916 --> 01:03:31,625
- Away from me!
- Kevin! Kevin, it's me!

357
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:34,041
It's me... Bobby.

358
01:03:34,166 --> 01:03:36,458
It's me.

359
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:38,500
Bobby.

360
01:03:38,625 --> 01:03:40,375
You didn't leave me.

361
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:44,083
You didn't leave me.

362
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:45,916
You didn't...

363
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,666
- Did he...?
- No.

364
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:56,500
Here, put this on.

365
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:05,333
She's still downstairs.

366
01:04:05,458 --> 01:04:08,333
We need to get you
out of here, okay?

367
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:12,958
You have to help me
pull, okay?

368
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,750
One, two, three.

369
01:04:24,958 --> 01:04:26,125
One more time.

370
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,375
Be right back, okay?
I promise.

371
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,208
Okay.

372
01:04:58,083 --> 01:05:00,166
What are you doing?

373
01:05:00,291 --> 01:05:01,541
Just trust me, okay?

374
01:05:01,666 --> 01:05:03,000
It'll be all right.

375
01:05:03,125 --> 01:05:04,791
J-Just back up a little bit.

376
01:05:11,125 --> 01:05:13,416
Three, two...

377
01:05:44,166 --> 01:05:46,458
Ow!

378
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:49,416
Oh, God!

379
01:05:52,583 --> 01:05:55,333
Kevin, what...
Kevin, what is it?!

380
01:05:58,666 --> 01:06:01,291
Come on.

381
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:02,541
Augh!

382
01:06:20,958 --> 01:06:22,333
I have an idea.

383
01:06:23,875 --> 01:06:25,125
N... No, no!

384
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:26,416
Don't leave me again!
Don't leave me!

385
01:06:26,541 --> 01:06:28,041
Listen, listen!
Listen, okay?

386
01:06:28,166 --> 01:06:30,458
Don't leave me again.

387
01:06:30,583 --> 01:06:34,333
The worst thing that could have
happened to us already happened.

388
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:37,250
Just stay here.
I'll be right back.

389
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:06,625
Rgh!

390
01:07:34,708 --> 01:07:35,750
Gah!

391
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:37,875
Rghh!

392
01:07:42,666 --> 01:07:44,416
- Ragh!
- Augh!

393
01:07:44,541 --> 01:07:47,083
No, let me...
Let me go!

394
01:07:47,208 --> 01:07:48,208
Augh!

395
01:08:11,416 --> 01:08:12,791
Ow! No!

396
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:21,375
Augh! Oh, God!

397
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,625
Oh, my God!

398
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,500
My finger!

399
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:28,708
You cut off my fucking finger!

400
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:32,125
You're dead!
Do you hear me?!

401
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:33,666
You're dead!

402
01:08:36,416 --> 01:08:37,583
You little shit.

403
01:08:59,083 --> 01:09:00,291
Bobby!

404
01:09:10,541 --> 01:09:12,083
Bobby!

405
01:09:15,208 --> 01:09:16,750
Bobby!

406
01:09:26,125 --> 01:09:28,458
Just say something!

407
01:09:32,916 --> 01:09:34,708
Come on.

408
01:10:21,875 --> 01:10:22,833
Ough!

409
01:10:22,958 --> 01:10:24,250
Fuck you!

410
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:45,666
Ungh!

411
01:11:11,791 --> 01:11:13,166
Hey! We've gotta go!

412
01:11:13,291 --> 01:11:15,875
- Mm...
- We've gotta go!

413
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,333
I can't.

414
01:11:17,458 --> 01:11:19,666
What do you... Yes, you can!

415
01:11:19,791 --> 01:11:21,875
Kevin, you have to go.

416
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,500
No! No!

417
01:11:23,625 --> 01:11:25,750
You have to.

418
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:31,000
Do you know what you told me?

419
01:11:32,541 --> 01:11:35,208
Friends till the end, remember?

420
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:37,416
This is not the end.

421
01:11:42,666 --> 01:11:43,833
God...

422
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:55,791
Boys!

423
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:42,916
Okay.

424
01:12:43,041 --> 01:12:44,083
Let's go.

425
01:12:45,458 --> 01:12:46,791
Come on.

426
01:12:50,208 --> 01:12:51,250
Guh...

427
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,416
Agh!

428
01:13:48,708 --> 01:13:50,166
Hello?

429
01:13:50,291 --> 01:13:51,541
Can anyone hear me?

430
01:13:55,083 --> 01:13:57,416
Last unit,
please identify yourself.

431
01:13:57,541 --> 01:14:01,083
Oh. My name is Kevin O'Connor,
and I need help.

432
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:03,208
Please send someone.

433
01:14:03,333 --> 01:14:05,041
Sir, this is
a restricted frequency.

434
01:14:05,166 --> 01:14:08,000
If you have an emergency,
please dial 911.

435
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:09,541
We don't... We don't
have a phone.

436
01:14:09,666 --> 01:14:11,541
Um, she already killed
the other officer.

437
01:14:11,666 --> 01:14:12,666
Please.

438
01:14:12,791 --> 01:14:14,166
What is your location?

439
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:16,583
U-Um, I-I don't know.

440
01:14:16,708 --> 01:14:19,708
It's a farmhouse,
and i-it looks far away.

441
01:14:19,833 --> 01:14:21,000
I'm in a cop car.

442
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:22,541
Find a safe place to hide.

443
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:24,583
Officers are on their way.

444
01:14:24,708 --> 01:14:26,166
Okay.

445
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:32,583
Here.

446
01:14:32,708 --> 01:14:34,000
I got something.

447
01:14:37,166 --> 01:14:39,541
Move your hand.

448
01:14:39,666 --> 01:14:42,166
Okay.

449
01:14:43,791 --> 01:14:46,375
Uh, here.

450
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,208
Don't move, okay?

451
01:14:48,333 --> 01:14:50,666
- Okay.
- Three, two, one.

452
01:14:50,791 --> 01:14:53,166
Agh!

453
01:15:00,625 --> 01:15:01,791
Thank you...

454
01:15:05,916 --> 01:15:08,333
We're still gonna go, right?

455
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:10,750
To California?

456
01:15:10,875 --> 01:15:13,500
Yeah, of course.

457
01:15:13,625 --> 01:15:14,916
They're gonna be here soon.

458
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,125
Oh, my God.

459
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,541
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God, Oh, my God!

460
01:15:19,666 --> 01:15:20,958
- We need to lock the doors!
- Please!

461
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:23,583
- What are you doing?! Please!
- No! No! No!

462
01:15:23,708 --> 01:15:25,041
- No! What are you doing?!
- Please don't!

463
01:15:25,166 --> 01:15:26,375
- No!
- No! No!

464
01:15:28,083 --> 01:15:30,125
Please don't!

465
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:32,083
No!

466
01:15:32,208 --> 01:15:33,583
No!

467
01:15:53,708 --> 01:15:55,458
Something's wrong.

468
01:15:55,583 --> 01:15:56,916
Yeah.

469
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:12,916
No! No! No!

470
01:16:13,041 --> 01:16:14,875
- No! No!
- No!

471
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,750
- No, no! Let me go!
- No!

472
01:16:16,875 --> 01:16:19,000
- No! Let me go!
- Bobby!

473
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:20,166
No!

474
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:21,708
Agh!

475
01:16:21,833 --> 01:16:22,750
Bobby!

476
01:16:25,708 --> 01:16:27,875
I got something for ya.

477
01:16:29,541 --> 01:16:31,625
Ungh!

478
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:34,208
Where do you think
you're going?

479
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:35,875
Stay down!

480
01:16:42,875 --> 01:16:44,291
Say goodnight.

481
01:16:44,416 --> 01:16:46,541
Gah! Ugh!

482
01:16:46,666 --> 01:16:48,875
Ahhhhh!

483
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,125
Ugh!

484
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:53,125
Rgh!

485
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:54,666
How does it feel?!

486
01:16:58,791 --> 01:17:00,750
Kevin!

487
01:17:17,708 --> 01:17:19,500
It's okay.

488
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:28,583
Okay.

489
01:17:35,958 --> 01:17:37,333
Boys?

490
01:17:53,958 --> 01:17:55,458
Do you see her?

491
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,875
No...

492
01:18:20,041 --> 01:18:21,583
Where are you?

493
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:55,791
Come on. Come on.

494
01:19:17,375 --> 01:19:18,541
Where is she?

495
01:19:18,666 --> 01:19:20,958
Is she still there?

496
01:19:21,083 --> 01:19:23,083
I don't see her anywhere.

497
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:27,250
- Sit down.
- Agh...

498
01:19:43,041 --> 01:19:45,458
Hey, I think she's gone.

499
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,166
Ugh! Agh...

500
01:19:52,333 --> 01:19:53,208
Hrgh!

501
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,250
Agh!

502
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:58,416
Get away from him!

503
01:19:58,541 --> 01:20:00,250
Agh! Gah!

504
01:20:00,375 --> 01:20:02,125
- Get down!
- God!

505
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:04,666
Get off of me!

506
01:20:04,791 --> 01:20:06,125
Augh!

507
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:13,375
- Guh!
- Ow!

508
01:20:15,416 --> 01:20:17,375
Agh!

509
01:20:20,708 --> 01:20:22,000
Grugh!

510
01:20:34,833 --> 01:20:37,041
Gah!

511
01:21:05,708 --> 01:21:08,000
Adam-2-4-4.
Shots fired, shots fired.

512
