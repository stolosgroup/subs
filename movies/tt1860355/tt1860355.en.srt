00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,290
[Man] Let's see here.

3
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,085
Starting right guard, shot.
No longer in school.

4
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,464
Starting linebacker, shot,
no longer in school.

5
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,134
Two players fighting
right in front of the coach

6
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,553
when he's trying
to make things work out.

7
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,265
Starting center, arrested for shooting
somebody in the face with a BB gun.

8
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:04,146
Most coaches, that would be pretty much
a career's worth of crap to deal with.

9
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,441
I think that sums up
the last two weeks for me.

10
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,737
And you know what?

11
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,948
I know damn good and well
what I sign up for every year.

12
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:18,702
And I keep coming back
because I love this program

13
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,621
and I feel very responsible to make sure

14
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:25,000
that you guys have a football season
that you can be proud of.

15
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,753
And I will kill myself
to make that happen.

16
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,091
This is our season.
I don't care what happens.

17
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,597
[Man] Back in the day
when the Firestone plant

18
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:21,765
was up and working,

19
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,892
the North Memphis area
used to be a booming place.

20
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,856
There was industry and there
were people in homes.

21
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,407
Since the plant closed,
that neighborhood just went to heck.

22
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,285
I mean, the people moved out,
the jobs were gone.

23
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,246
As a result, the football program
fell off the map.

24
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:51,712
[Woman] When I came,
the winning scores were very, um...

25
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,005
I don't remember winning.

26
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,925
For almost ten to 14 years,

27
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,052
we never won a football game.

28
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,515
We'd play ten games
and we ended up 0-10.

29
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,393
[Man] Oh, you know when you
see Manassas on the schedule,

30
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,104
"Oh, we gonna beat them.
We don't even gotta practice hard."

31
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,815
Bookie, come say hello to me!

32
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,734
Are you actually here
to work out today?

33
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,611
- [Player] I am!
- I am so proud of you.

34
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,779
What's up? A freshman.

35
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,323
15 years old.

36
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,366
[Williams] If it hadn't been
for Coach Courtney,

37
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,993
I don't know where
we would be right now.

38
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,621
[Smith] He's what got
the kids so excited

39
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,915
about the opportunities
and the possibilities.

40
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,083
He's the one that's got them
headed in that direction.

41
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:39,009
[Courtney] The foundation
has got to be a solid platform

42
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,929
that you can stand on
and speak to these kids and say,

43
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,389
"This is the way you build yourself.

44
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,558
If you build yourself this way
and handle yourself this way

45
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,019
and have character,
you get to play football."

46
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,480
And winning will take care of itself

47
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:55,484
because young men of character
and discipline and commitment

48
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:59,154
end up winning in life.
And they end up winning in football.

49
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,781
Well, when you flip it,

50
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,325
and the foundation
of what you're doing is football,

51
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,495
and then you hope
all that other stuff follows...

52
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,414
Well, then you think
football builds character.

53
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:13,335
Which it does not.
Football reveals character.

54
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,145
[Courtney] All right,
shut up and listen up.

55
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,190
Where's Big Kenneth?

56
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,360
Has anybody seen Big Kenneth?

57
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,489
[Courtney] Huh?
All right, listen up.

58
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,659
Everybody imagine
the state of Tennessee on a map.

59
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,660
OK?

60
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,955
Way over in the corner,
you got Knoxville and Chattanooga.

61
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,083
Toward the middle you got Nashville.
And you come on down here.

62
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,626
Everybody outside of Memphis,

63
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,963
do you know what they say
the biggest city in Mississippi is?

64
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,507
Memphis.

65
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,426
The rest of the state
doesn't even claim us

66
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,386
when it comes to football.

67
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,471
We're viewed by people

68
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,266
outside of the West Tennessee area
who've played us...

69
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,644
Undisciplined, not very well coached,

70
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,398
running around acting a fool
before the game,

71
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,443
about everything other than football,

72
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,987
and about ourselves
rather than about the team.

73
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,701
You have a responsibility
this year, guys,

74
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,286
just like the teams
that came before you.

75
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,662
You have a responsibility
to play hard.

76
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,457
You have a responsibility to take care
of yourself in the classroom.

77
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,793
And you have a responsibility
to show Memphis

78
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,420
what Manassas Football is about.

79
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,302
[Courtney] As you all know,
we got work to do today.

80
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,138
Lots of learning.
Everybody's head right.

81
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,306
[Whistle blows]

82
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:56,438
[Courtney] When I got there, there was
17 kids for a varsity football program.

83
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,315
First team, offensive line right here.

84
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:03,153
Joaquin and Robert on defense.
Let's go. Let's move!

85
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,155
There are good athletes
in the neighborhood,

86
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,157
but they weren't
gonna play for Manassas.

87
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,408
And do you blame them?

88
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,286
Not only was Manassas
one of the worst programs in the city,

89
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,706
it was arguably one of
the worst programs in the entire state.

90
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,334
Let's go, hustle up.
Tre, you're a safety.

91
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,504
Sills, tight end.
Receiver, down there. Hit it!

92
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,756
Hot Pocket, do you know
the freakin' routes?

93
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,840
Go, go, go!

94
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,259
Our first year there,
we won four games.

95
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,845
And people were opening
their eyes, saying,

96
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,306
you know, "Manassas isn't
the worst team in the city any more.

97
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,308
I mean, they're beating a few people."

98
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,476
[Courtney] There it is,

99
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,186
- that's what we want.
- [Blows whistle]

100
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:40,899
The next year,
there's this group of 8th graders...

101
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:45,487
That's O.C. And Julius
and T.O. And JP and all these guys,

102
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,739
that all showed up
to the weight room one day,

103
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:52,994
and said, "We see y'all getting better.
We hear what you got going on."

104
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:57,290
And I said, "Guys, all of you,
as a group, come to Manassas.

105
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,085
Just stay here
and let's build this thing."

106
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,086
Hike!

107
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,132
[Courtney] They were talking it up
in the neighborhood.

108
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,968
"We're going to Manassas.
We're going to make Manassas good."

109
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,929
And in their first year, they're 1-9.

110
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,347
And got hammered.

111
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,933
There you go. Good.

112
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,520
Instead of laying down,
they continued to try

113
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,730
and they continued to believe
and they continued to work.

114
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,191
You better win that ball, Will!

115
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,235
And now this is their senior year.

116
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,613
And my biggest concern
is that it doesn't end up

117
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,115
as great as it should be for them.

118
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:34,161
And I don't mean they have to win
the state championship to be successful.

119
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:39,040
The one thing that Manassas
has never done is win a playoff game.

120
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,084
- [Whistle blows]
- Everybody to Coach Coleman. Let's go!

121
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,502
[Courtney] Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

122
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,255
Guys, you're playing
a football game Friday.

123
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,633
We got work to do.
We just gotta keep getting better.

124
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,677
[Smith] I like their chances
this year, I do.

125
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:54,764
And it starts with that offensive line
and with Mr. Brown.

126
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:59,019
[Courtney] Come on, O.C. Come on,
let's go! Come on, O. C!

127
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,229
[Man] We get just hordes of film
coming to our office,

128
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,315
and to be totally honest

129
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,402
most of the film we get gets thrown
in a pile, never to be seen again.

130
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,071
So this link came across my desk,

131
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,366
and the first play,
you knew O.C. Was special.

132
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,204
[Announcer] From Manassas High School,
number 77, O.C. Brown!

133
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,248
- [Cheering and yelling]
- [Whistle blows]

134
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,962
[Man] That's what
I'm talking about, O.C.!

135
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,132
[Courtney] O.C. Was one of those kids
from Humes Junior High, in that class.

136
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,175
Hike!

137
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,554
[Courtney] Mike noticed in O.C.,
he said, "Bill, this kid is...

138
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,890
...for his speed and size,
he's just a big athlete.

139
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,058
He's really good."

140
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,061
[Ray] We were thinking this kid can
play some college football somewhere.

141
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,522
But no one had
ever heard of him. Nobody.

142
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,483
And so I pieced together
this grainy YouTube clip...

143
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,945
[Courtney] It had thousands of hits
in the first 48 hours,

144
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,239
and that's where it went nuts.

145
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,074
[♪ Dan Auerbach:
"Heartbroken In Disrepair"]

146
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,164
[Man] Just to see him
sometimes turn the corner

147
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,668
and nobody'd be there
and he's running with the back,

148
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,128
you think, "Oh, my gosh, this is scary.

149
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,964
That's a big dude running that fast."

150
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,090
Got some mail.

151

152

153
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,142
Nah, these ones I got
in one day, I think.

154
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:26,982
[Courtney] O.C. Is a perfect
picture of North Memphis.

155
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,734
Raised by his grandmother
in a very small house.

156
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,821
Mother's deceased,
father's kind of in and out.

157
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,615
If he can have a good senior year
and get a Division 1 scholarship,

158
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,742
you know, the sky's the limit.

159
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,955
I don't want to say football
is everything to me, but...

160
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,749
[O.C. Continues]

161
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,724
[Courtney] This is a very good
friend of mine.

162
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,977
And when you find out who he is and what
he's about and where he comes from,

163
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,354
you'll find out anybody can do anything.

164
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,773
So, just to speak to you
for a few minutes

165
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,984
is my buddy Aaron Hayden.

166
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,986
- Thanks, Coach.
- [Applauding]

167
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,864
I always ask two questions when I speak,

168
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,867
and I'm going to raise my hand
and answer the questions myself.

169
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,202
Raise your hand, anybody in here

170
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,496
that has a parent
that graduated from college,

171
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,832
in this room, raise your hand.

172
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,418
You'll notice I put my hand down.

173
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:32,255
Anybody raise your hand if you have
two parents that graduated from college.

174
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,466
Mom and dad graduated from college.

175
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,803
Is there anybody in this room
who has two parents?

176
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,221
I got another question.

177
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,641
Raise your hand
if you've had a close relative,

178
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:46,269
brother, uncle, cousin, anybody,
that has served time in jail.

179
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:52,150
I have my hand up as well, and that's...

180
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,319
...that's the thing,
that when I talk to kids,

181
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,862
from where we come from,

182
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,323
is that you got to think
outside your circumstances.

183
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,533
I didn't have a dad in the home.

184
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:05,163
Loved my mama to death, but she had
a new man, you know, every month.

185
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:09,042
Some dude was sleeping on the couch.
And I walked by him as I went to school.

186
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,294
And I could have went to school
or I could have stayed at home.

187
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,630
It really wasn't like anybody
forced me to do anything.

188
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,965
But it's not where you start.

189
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,468
It's what... what is it?
It's where you finish.

190
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:22,138
Thanks for having me.
And I appreciate being here, man.

191
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,473
[Applauding]

192
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,686
[Courtney] Release, Julius!

193
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,396
Stop!

194
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,398
Stop, back, back, back, back, back.

195
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,109
Get on the ball.
This is so easy, y'all.

196
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:38,321
You block. When you hear the thud,
you get in your lanes.

197
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,240
And you got to hustle into your lanes.

198
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,450
But you don't go anywhere
until you hear the thud.

199
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,702
Do you hear me?

200
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,454
[Man] When you look around this program,
not a lot of equipment.

201
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,499
They pretty much have
to do with what they have.

202
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,960
They have a nice school here
at Manassas, a brand-new school,

203
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,087
but unfortunately they got that built

204
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,424
and didn't get the rest of the school
built, which is the athletic part of it.

205
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,800
[Courtney] All right, let's go.

206
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:05,098
- O.C., you have to block first.
- [O.C.] There was nobody over there!

207
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,558
Damn it.

208
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,270
The city schools really are...
They play on a different level

209
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,773
in terms of support
and in terms of funding.

210
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,651
[Courtney] When you address that thing
is the minute it hits his right hand.

211
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,612
That's the landscape
that we have in athletics today.

212
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,073
It's kind of like America.
There are the haves and the have-nots.

213
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,491
[Courtney] Get it in there.

214
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,953
Oh, my God, Kevin.

215
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:32,792
The City of Memphis school system
is always just way underfunded.

216
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,544
There's just no money,

217
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,296
and if you don't have a booster club,

218
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,882
the only other way
to pay for the program

219
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,676
is to play what they call "pay games."

220
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:45,305
We would bus out
to places like Ripley,

221
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,641
Haywood, Milan, Westview...

222
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:52,729
We're talking big, powerful
3 and 4A football teams.

223
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,607
They'd beat our ass.
They give us a check

224
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,983
and send us back on the way.

225
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,528
And those five or six games would
raise 15 to 20 thousand dollars,

226
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,364
and that's what would
fund the football program.

227
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,785
The problem is, by the time
you got to your district games,

228
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,912
your 19 kids were beat up,

229
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,206
and pretty much accepted
that they were horrible

230
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,082
and couldn't win any games.

231
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,627
Well, Jim and I started Manrise

232
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:20,089
for the sole purpose of raising money
to give to Manassas like a booster club.

233
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:23,259
It's a program now.
It's not having to go up the road

234
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:26,012
to play these huge schools
that are going to destroy us

235
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,850
and an opportunity to tell kids
in the hallway, "Come play football."

236
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:43,822
[Courtney] Dickens?

237
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,034
- You weren't in practice yesterday?
- Yes, sir.

238
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,577
- You weren't there Monday, were you?
- No.

239
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,746
- You going to be there today?
- Yes, sir.

240
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,541
Get your grades right.
You need to be on the football field!

241
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,085
What a shame. What a shame.

242
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,420
Why'd you fly the coop on me?

243
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,423
Rarely do coaches come back
and go through all the stress,

244
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,259
the headache, and the tired
and everything else

245
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,344
for all the kids on the team.

246
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:10,014
It's typically one or two
that matter so much to you

247
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,641
that you're willing to put up with it.

248
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,768
Though, I'm not supposed
to be showing my project,

249
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,144
but I'm going to show you.

250
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:19,732
This is the one I spent four hours
in the early morning doing.

251
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,612
I'll show you my other project.

252
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,533
This is the egg in a bottle.

253
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,536
[Money] I'm the smallest lineman.

254
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,373
Like, I was the smallest linemen
on the offensive line last year.

255
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,084
When I first noticed, I'm like,
"I'm the littlest thing on the line."

256
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:42,255
Everybody else is all big and wide,
and I was just small.

257
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,632
But I feel like a giant.

258
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,970
But when you standing next to them,
I'm like a little pee-wee.

259
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,306
Coach, put me in, put me in there!

260
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,766
[Courtney] He's completely undersized
to play right tackle.

261
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,060
He has no business being a right tackle.

262
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,730
He's always out-manned physically.

263
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,024
And he always wins.

264
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:05,278
And that's not
because he's some physical specimen.

265
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,322
It's because he's so mentally tough.

266
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:11,284
[Player] I think of him as preacher
boy. Like, he's so serious.

267
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:16,080
He's so young, but like, Money got,
like, everything mapped out.

268
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,290
I'm pretty sure he can tell you

269
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,876
everything that's gonna
go on in his life...

270
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,252
and he gonna go by it.

271
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,838
This... I be lookin'
at this all the time.

272
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,634
This tells me, like,
the top colleges to go to.

273
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,928
Uh..."Getting accepted."

274
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,973
You got to have
a high school GPA of a 3.7.

275
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,600
I have a 3.8.

276
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,106
I'm living with my grandmother,
and, you know, we stay in North Memphis.

277
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,109
All my family has been in Memphis.

278
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,696
They've never been
outside of North Memphis.

279
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,698
Even if I don't make it
out of Tennessee,

280
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,617
I'm gonna get out of Memphis.

281
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,369
[Girl on PA system]
Good morning, Manassas.

282
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,871
Would you please stand
for the Pledge of Allegiance

283
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,248
and the Manassas High School Pledge?

284
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,543
[Courtney] Let's go! Come on. Come on.

285
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,757
[Groaning]

286
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,093
Very nice.
Good pitch, Will!

287
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,138
We got it right the third time.
That's impressive.

288
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,682
Huddle up!

289
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,017
[Player] Huddle up!

290
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,311
[Courtney] Trying real hard
to get this team prepared.

291
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,106
Now, I had to come off the hook
three times yesterday,

292
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,650
I had to cuss way too much.

293
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,611
I have to go home and pray
for forgiveness

294
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,197
for the way I talked
to these young guys.

295
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,199
And I don't want to be
driven there again.

296
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:37,829
Please do not make me act a fool
out here to get you all motivated.

297
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,290
Your first football game
is in two days.

298
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,627
All this bullshit we've been doing
is all about tomorrow.

299
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:49,132
Call it again and let's get off the ball
and be excited about being here.

300
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,384
- Thirteen... on one, ready?
- Break!

301
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,761
Thirteen... on one, ready?

302
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:54,887
[Courtney] Let's go, offense.

303
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:55,930
Come on!

304
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,140
[Coach] Hustle up!

305
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,853
[Courtney] A lot to be nervous about.
It's the first game out.

306
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,815
Starting off with a loss,
I worry about the team's psyche.

307
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,235
I want them to rise
above the inner city knock.

308
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,529
The knock on inner city
football teams,

309
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,907
if you score on 'em first
or get up on 'em 14-nothin' early,

310
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,117
they'll lay down.

311
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,244
You know,
they don't have the discipline

312
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,579
to keep themselves together
and come back.

313
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,789
That's the knock, I mean,

314
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,458
whether you like it or not,
that's the knock.

315
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,625
That's what people say.

316
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,300
[Announcer] The sun is setting
in the western sky right now.

317
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,135
The field lights are coming up here.

318
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,554
And we're just excited about seeing

319
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,307
another great night
of high school football action.

320
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:43,728
Manassas has a rich history of sports
and athletics in the Memphis area.

321
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,396
They've had some great basketball teams.

322
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,107
Football... it's been some lean years.

323
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,400
[Courtney] I want you to hear me.

324
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,029
Ever since I've been at Manassas,
it's been building every year.

325
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:56,115
One year to the next, to the better,
to the better, to the better.

326
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,576
The group I'm standing with right now

327
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,496
is the best team
I've ever coached at Manassas.

328
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,042
Not only are you going to prove tonight
that you are disciplined,

329
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,045
not only are you going to prove tonight
that you are well-coached,

330
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,464
you're going to prove tonight
you're the better program.

331
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,384
And leave no doubters
about who we are and what we are.

332
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,095
[Boys] Yes, sir.

333
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,850
[Announcer] Here to kick it away will be
the Manassas Tigers out of Memphis, T-N.

334
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:29,065
Going to be gathered in at the 15,
to the 20, to the 30.

335
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,068
He's still on his feet, dashes his way
to the middle of the field.

336
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,321
Forty! Forty-five!
Thirty! Twenty-five!

337
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,115
Inside the ten!
Down to the five!

338
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,825
Into the end zone! Touchdown!

339
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,911
[Courtney] Coach Raymond!
We had ten men on the field!

340
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,711
[Announcer] They have the back
ten yards, going to run the offense.

341
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,964
Pitches it and has running room.
Inside the ten!

342
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,467
He's going to go in!
And it's 14-nothing, just like that!

343
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,845
Manassas struggling here defensively.

344
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,721
They got to get something going
here to get that confidence,

345
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,765
especially
on the offensive side of the ball.

346
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,643
[Courtney] Listen to me!
We can come back, man!

347
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,728
It's two touchdowns and a whole quarter.

348
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,439
- Let's go kick their butts! Let's go!
- [Ray] Make it happen!

349
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,483
[Announcer] Second down at eight.
The ball at the 36.

350
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,403
Back. Looking. Throwing.

351
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,988
They got a man open
and it's caught!

352
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,992
Inside the ten! Down to the five!
And into the end zone! Touchdown!

353
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,912
[Announcer] That is a
devastating play for Manassas.

354
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,627
Redmond into shotgun, fourth and 11...

355
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,672
...throws... Man open
and he dropped it!

356
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,136
Redmond... hands it off this time.

357
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,680
Running back, nothing,
and we get him down.

358
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,354
Receiver seems wary.
Redmond the quarterback under center.

359
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,190
Play fake, running for his life.

360
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,943
Caught on the backside,
fumbling the ball, it's loose.

361
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,695
Yes, that really hurts there.

362
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,405
[Whistle blows]

363
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:11,000
Clock running and Manassas
about to fall to 0-1.

364
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,934
[Courtney] The character of a man is not
measured in how he handles his wins,

365
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,770
but what he does with his failures.
And tonight, we failed.

366
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,693
And everybody says, "When you get
these inner city kids down,

367
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:41,614
they'll lay over
and you'll beat them by 40." Not us!

368
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:46,953
Everybody'll say, "They're 0-1.
They're going to fold up camp.

369
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,208
They'll be 2-8 by the end
of this thing." No! Not us!

370
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,671
You walk with your chins up.

371
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,465
I am proud to be a Manassas Tiger
on this field tonight,

372
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,677
because my guys didn't lay down.
They got heart.

373
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,012
Now let's put our mind
with our heart and our bodies

374
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,265
and let's finish this thing this year!

375
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:11,018
[All praying] "...hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,

376
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:15,481
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread..."

377
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,288
[Courtney]
I never knew Manassas existed.

378
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,790
And then I started a business in 2001

379
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,293
and bought an old dilapidated,
crappy piece of property

380
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,005
on North 7th Street
in North Memphis.

381
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,424
What are they doing over there, Cliffy?

382
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,759
- Pardon?
- What are they doing over there?

383
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:47,096
- The wall in front of the chain.
- I've got some welding to do.

384
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,931
Remember I brought that up
yesterday in the meeting?

385
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,266
- Take care of that right now?
- Right.

386
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,226
- I need that basswood in the kiln.
- OK.

387
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,853
All right, Cliff.

388
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,196
[Woman] He sold cars for several years,

389
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,991
and he knew it was
a steppingstone to something else.

390
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,578
He was a great salesman, you know?

391
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,788
He could talk anybody into anything.

392
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,417
It's 7:45, Scrappy.

393
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,044
Well, why are you asking me
what time it is?

394
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,670
I'm your boss, dumb-ass.

395
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,089
You're supposed
to not ask me what time it is.

396
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,383
If somebody walked in
this afternoon and said,

397
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,553
"I'll give you whatever
for the business,"

398
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,931
and he's got enough money
to cover his expenses and kids

399
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,975
for the rest of his life
and he gets to go coach,

400
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:36,312
that's a no-brainer.
You know, he's gone.

401
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,522
You know, I mean,
that's what he wants to do.

402
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,608
He wants to coach.

403
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:46,113
[Car horn beeping]

404
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,407
Dantre, get them out. Let's go.

405
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,577
Hey, how are you?
Pleasure to meet you.

406
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,995
So, how you doin'?

407
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,998
Look at you.
You're starting to grow up a little bit.

408
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,541
- What happened to my little Chavis?
- [Chuckling]

409
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:58,751
Now you're big Chavis.

410
00:22:58,919 --> 00:22:59,919
Good to see you.

411
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,004
You gonna hang around practice
or are you leaving?

412
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,839
Can he stay for a little while?

413
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,759
Yeah. Yeah, what time y'all
normally be finished?

414
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,386
- 5:30.
- OK.

415
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,430
- [Courtney] Can he stay?
- [Woman] Yeah, right here...

416
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,766
[Courtney] Chavis played for us
as a freshman.

417
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,434
Confidentially,
if you want to talk to him

418
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,936
and he wants to talk to you about it,
you can find out.

419
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,980
But he missed his last year.
And he's back as a junior.

420
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:23,150
Chavis has serious anger issues.

421
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:26,278
And it's one of those things
that I don't think he can help it.

422
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,488
[Alarm goes off]

423
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,865
Back up! Back up!

424
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,043
Chavis is loud.
Chavis is big, and he aggressive.

425
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,170
[O.C.] One minute he could be laughing

426
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:47,967
and the next...
ten seconds he mad or something.

427
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,185
He went to jail and had a rough life.

428
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:02,398
And, you know, it's hard for him to get
to know people or trust anybody.

429
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:06,402
[Woman] I think it's really hard for
Chavis not to have his father around.

430
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,404
And he has never been around.

431
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,906
I think that's where a lot
of Chavis' anger come from.

432
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,456
[Man] How come?

433
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,762
He's real fast.

434
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,187
That's my favorite animal, actually
'cause it's like...

435
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,732
Turtles is like a human being to me

436
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,902
'cause it's like they gotta
be hard on the outside,

437
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,863
but they really soft on the inside.

438
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:55,451
Just look at...
at the texture of them.

439
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,244
See? This is like a human.

440
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:00,956
On the outside, everybody want
to be hard and show their strength.

441
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,792
But on the inside,
it's like they just all flimsy

442
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,796
and, you know, just skin and bones.

443
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,469
[Courtney] Money, I need that VCR!

444
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,554
What time are we supposed to be in here?

445
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,640
[All] 2:20.

446
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,934
[Courtney] At 2:23,
I walk in and everybody's late.

447
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,061
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

448
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,064
It's exactly what I'm talking about.

449
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,482
This is how we lose games,

450
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,943
'cause y'all can't follow
simple directions.

451
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,279
All right, so here's what we got.
Go ahead, I got it from here, Money.

452
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,454
First thing we're gonna do:
Do not watch your play books.

453
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,997
Watch the film.

454
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:47,211
- All right, here's the deal...
- [chattering, arguing]

455
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,797
Stop! Stop! What is y'all's problem?

456
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,924
[Chavis] Better stop playing me, bro.

457
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,843
What is y'all's problem?
You go over there, Money.

458
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,845
- Better stop playin'.
- Go over there, Money.

459
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,097
[Mutters]

460
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,890
- Stop playin', boy!
- What?

461
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:05,521
You shut up. I just told him to shut up.
You go sit down. Sit.

462
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:09,483
- Money! Sit.
- Be quiet, Money.

463
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,859
Go sit down over there.

464
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,821
Go... Don't touch one another.

465
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:20,661
Shut up. Did you hear me?

466
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,376
Money! Money!

467
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,529
Y'all killing me.

468
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,073
You're sucking it right out of me.

469
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,578
I got four children at home and a wife.

470
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,872
My kid's...
My own son's first football game

471
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,082
is in an hour and a half,
and I'm here with you.

472
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:14,840
My business isn't making any money,
and I'm still spending my money on you.

473
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,969
Y'all ain't givin' nothing back.
You're just taking.

474
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,264
You ain't giving me shit.

475
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,099
You're just taking.

476
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,937
Now, you...
You're going to apologize.

477
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,398
[Chavis]

478
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,237
You know what's going to happen?

479
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,739
Of course he's going to say something
'cause he's pissed.

480
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:40,949
[Courtney] No, you're not.

481
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:45,537
Listen to me. No, you're not.
You know why?

482
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:49,375
Because I just asked you to.
You think I want to deal with this?

483
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,542
I'm trying to get y'all prepared.

484
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,045
He is not gay.

485
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,132
OK, then keep your thoughts to yourself.
He ain't gay.

486
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,224
[Courtney] Chavis...

487
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:09,687
...you, for the betterment
of somebody other than yourself,

488
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,980
need to do what I'm asking you to do.

489
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,576
It's not part
of the job description.

490
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,415
Of course, I don't know really
what the job description is, frankly.

491
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,508
You want to tell me you're sorry
for not coming when I called you?

492
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,010
- Sorry, Coach.
- I know you are.

493
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,309
It pissed me off, too.

494
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,019
I appreciate you
getting away from him

495
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,188
and not screaming
when I told you not to.

496
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:56,233
You backed off and did what you did,
and you left because you were hot.

497
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,986
You're not going
to turn back on the team.

498
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,155
You're gonna come back
with me right now.

499
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,657
Listen to me. Listen to me.

500
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,535
Look at me. You're gonna
come back with me right now,

501
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,328
and you are not going
to get in a fight with him...

502
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,747
Hey, listen to me.

503
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,582
And he is not going
to get in a fight with you.

504
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,043
And you're going to put
the team before yourself.

505
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,087
- And you're going to be a man.
- Yes, sir.

506
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,922
And you're going to put it behind you.

507
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,675
And he's going to be a man,
and he's going to put it behind you.

508
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:25,345
And our team is not going
to be torn apart by stupidity

509
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,890
- because we're not going to let it.
- Yes, sir.

510
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,393
- Will you do that for me?
- Yes, sir.

511
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,978
What were you,
arguing over the arm rest?

512
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:37,024
I don't know. He up there playin'.
He shouldn't have moved me.

513
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,525
Just don't sit next to him.

514
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:42,070
I thought we was friends or something.

515
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,698
OK, listen, can you say that to him?

516
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,495
- Why not?
- I don't know, I...

517
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:50,996
Say, "Chavis, yeah, I'm mad,

518
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,581
but it hurt me because I thought
we were friends.

519
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,708
I thought we were just friends."

520
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,005
Get your shit. Let's go.

521
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,554
[Sighs]

522
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,600
[Courtney] Hut!

523
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,310
[Rhythmic claps]

524
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,106
[Courtney] Hut! Hut!
All the way through.

525
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,860
- Hut! Hut!
- [Clap]

526
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,406
- Hut! Hut!
- [Clap]

527
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,408
Don't send him back
until I say something.

528
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,578
- Hut! Hut!
- [Clap]

529
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,288
[Coach] All the way through.

530
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:36,375
[Courtney] Trezevant is full
of a bunch of jackasses!

531
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,170
A bunch of rogues!
A bunch of talkers!

532
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,923
Trezevant, it's our first district game.

533
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:47,678
We've got guys who have not
gotten along in the past,

534
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,221
ever since they were young,

535
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,140
and there's an enormous
amount of hype about the game.

536
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:56,395
If you lose Friday night, you're going
to hear about it for a year.

537
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,649
And I'm tellin' ya,
Friday night is won today!

538
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,237
Let's have a good practice.
Let's get on with the haul!

539
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,447
[Boy shouting]

540
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,617
[Courtney] Don't underplay
what this game's about.

541
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,452
I want you guys just to base block.

542
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:16,540
It's about
the up-and-coming Manassas program,

543
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:20,502
fighting the established program
that's willing to do anything

544
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,506
- to keep you down.
- Now! Let's go, on the hop.

545
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,800
We got Trezevant's ass to kick!

546
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,511
This games about what
we've been building to do right

547
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,680
and what they've been
doing wrong for years.

548
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:35,142
Y'all gotta wanna get better!
You gotta want to!

549
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,977
Friday night you have
an unbelievable opportunity to say...

550
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:40,939
"Yep. We are... We are
the class of North Memphis!"

551
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,441
There it is!

552
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:46,695
Golly! Golly!

553
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,196
That is sick!

554
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,990
Trezevant is trying
to punk them guys out,

555
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,783
and they wouldn't even let 'em
get none of them

556
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,161
because they had their heads
on right because they're tight.

557
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,538
That's what we're going to be!

558
00:31:56,706 --> 00:32:00,417
[Yelling, chanting]

559
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,423
[Man] I had to have a meeting with my
boss, the director of security.

560
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,508
The reason they
called me into a meeting...

561
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:13,096
...is about the rumors that is
going around about Trezevant

562
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,640
sending messages to you guys

563
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:18,060
that if they don't win the game,
they gonna win the fight.

564
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,187
- What school do we go to?
- [All] Manassas.

565
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,522
- What school do we go to?
- [All] Manassas!

566
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,150
[Swansey] How do we act in public?

567
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,778
We act like we have
home training, correct?

568
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:28,779
[Boys] Yes, sir.

569
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,114
[Swansey] When you guys take that field,

570
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,784
I don't care what's said,

571
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,078
I don't care if somebody
puts their hands on you.

572
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,831
I have enough people there to handle
whatever situation that comes on.

573
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,668
I got your back, man.
Nobody's going to do anything to you.

574
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,128
You're all big boys.
I know you can handle yourselves,

575
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,674
but let me do my job, please.
And win this game tonight.

576
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:52,844
[Announcer] First and ten,
the ball at the 23-yard line.

577
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,721
The quarterback
has his back to the I,

578
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,391
hands it off to the running back,
turns the corner,

579
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:00,102
coming out of that pack,
he has running room. He's gonna go in.

580
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:05,315
That is going to be a 23-yard scamper,
and just like that, it's 6-nothing.

581
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,651
Pull up!
Let's go! Pull 'em up!

582
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,944
[Announcer] Second down and eight.

583
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:12,155
Here's the play-fake in motion
near the near side of the quarterback.

584
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,950
Dashing inside, outside!
To the ten! Down to the five!

585
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:18,245
He stretches into the end zone!
Touchdown!

586
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,955
- [Cheering]
- Come on, man!

587
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,499
[Announcer] The Manassas Tigers need
to do everything that they can do

588
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,918
to get some points on the board
before we end this half.

589
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,628
All we gotta do is get a score!

590
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,965
[Announcer] First and ten.
Here's Redmond under center this time.

591
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,258
Here's the handoff.

592
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:35,387
He spins, and boy,
he's popped hard as he hits the 45.

593
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,264
Here's Redmond
on the quarterback keeper,

594
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,350
trying to get loose
and will be sacked in the backfield.

595
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,020
The only thing that occurred there
was about a five-yard loss.

596
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,731
Boy, those guys have taken
some beatings here, haven't they?

597
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,233
[Whistle blows]

598
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,112
[Courtney] That's bullshit!
He tried to break his damn neck.

599
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,906
Then they get up clapping about it.

600
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,784
[Announcer] The game's not over yet,
but it looks pretty dire for Manassas.

601
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:02,122
About to fall to 0-2 unless they
can stage a miraculous comeback.

602
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,544
[Courtney] Get in tight!

603
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,212
[Marching band playing]

604
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,839
[Courtney] All right, listen up!

605
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:17,262
We've done all the things
that we told you you had to not do.

606
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,599
And you're down 20-nothin'.

607
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,060
That's it.

608
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,561
Now, here's the deal.

609
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,606
This is
an unbelievably good opportunity.

610
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,233
You come back from that...

611
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,445
...now you're talking about something.

612
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,447
You lay down on that,

613
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:39,826
well... then you forgot
what we're about.

614
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:45,040
I do not want to see
anybody dropping their head.

615
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,543
I want to see us get a stop
and score and see what happens.

616
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,295
- Can we do that?
- [All] Yes, sir!

617
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:53,548
Hey, you got to believe
in yourselves, fellas.

618
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,842
You can come back,
but you gotta go to work.

619
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:56,843
We're coming back!

620
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,637
[All chanting, yelling]

621
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,263
- Let's go!
- Let's go, man!

622
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,849
[Announcer] Manassas trying
to do it again, five-man front.

623
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,477
Drops, looks... throws.

624
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,438
Got a man open and it's caught!
Inside the five! Touchdown!

625
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,321
[Player] Defense!

626
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,323
[All chanting] Defense! Defense!

627
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,741
[Announcer] First and ten.

628
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,618
Here's the handoff.
Fumbling the ball.

629
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:25,038
It's loose and Manassas has come up
with it at the 25-yard line.

630
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,335
[Courtney] You got them mashed.
They're laying down!

631
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,920
You got to keep mashing!

632
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,964
[Announcer] Redmond,
backs in the I again.

633
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:39,177
Redmond drops straight back, looks,
throws! It is caught! Touchdown!

634
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,888
[Cheering]

635
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,142
20-14, Manassas
in the midst of a comeback.

636
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,726
[Courtney] We just won
the third quarter!

637
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,271
If we win the fourth quarter,
we win the freakin' game!

638
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,564
Let's go get 'em, guys!

639
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:53,108
[Announcer] We thought Manassas
was going to get blown out of here.

640
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,776
And right now,
they've got all the momentum,

641
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,695
down by six and with the ball.

642
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,446
Manassas trying to take the lead.

643
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,240
They have the back ten yards.

644
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,659
Redmond. Here's the handoff.

645
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:06,663
Powers his way into the end zone.
Touchdown Manassas!

646
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,585
Credit the Tigers.
They really played a great second half.

647
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,795
[Courtney]
Let the clock run, baby, run!

648
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,630
Run, baby, run.

649
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:18,925
[Announcer] I would be shocked
if Redmond doesn't do anything

650
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:23,013
other than down the ball here
and get this over with.

651
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,641
[Courtney] Take the snap,
take a knee, game over.

652
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:30,687
If they swing at you,
run to me like I'm your daddy.

653
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,606
I will take care of it. Let's go.

654
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,360
Holy moly.

655
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,447
Everybody! Helmets strapped!

656
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,157
Do not take them off
until you get to the bus!

657
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,868
Get your damn helmet on,
helmet strapped!

658
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,037
[Announcer] They come with everyone
right at the line of scrimmage.

659
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,371
[Courtney] Toe-to-toe!

660
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,248
[Announcer] Redmond's just going to
fall on one knee, I would think.

661
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,417
Takes the snap,
that's exactly what he does.

662
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,544
- [Horn blares]
- [Cheering]

663
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,255
[Announcer] Manassas wins the ball game!

664
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,719
Coach! Coach! Coach!

665
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,389
No. The cops don't... Uh-uh!

666
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,391
The cops don't
want us to shake hands.

667
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:18,944
- [Officer 1] Let's go! Go to the bus!
- [Officer 2] Go to the bus!

668
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:23,657
Hey, good job, Manassas!
Yeah! Yeah!

669
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,867
Yeah! Yeah!

670
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:37,170
[Man] Let's go! Report cards!
I don't get a report card, no play!

671
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:41,675
You got O.C.'s?

672
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:42,676
[Player]

673
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,726
O. C!

674
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,438
Who's your teacher in journalism?

675
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,983
I got three different teachers.
This is the third teacher...

676
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,694
Well, how are you going to have a 60?

677
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:03,154
I don't know, Coach.
We had Miss Wells at first.

678
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:06,574
Then we had a old lady,
but now we got a young teacher.

679
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,828
That's what I'm saying.

680
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:13,748
How do you get a 90 in pre-calculus
and a 70 in keyboard?

681
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,710
You got good grades
in all your normal classes,

682
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,504
and you got crap ones
in these stupid classes.

683
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,256
[Woman] We had told Coach Bill

684
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,009
that we was going to stop
O.C. From playing football

685
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:27,554
because his grades wasn't up
like they was supposed to be.

686
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:32,142
[Courtney] Mike and I started talking
about O.C.'s academic struggles.

687
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,436
And we said, you know,
if this keeps going on,

688
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,396
he's going to lose
an opportunity to play college football

689
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,773
and get out and go
do something with his life.

690
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,234
[Ethel] So, the coach done
come in and they talked to us

691
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:45,780
and they say, "Well, we got a solution
if you'll let us work with him."

692
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,991
[Ray] We ran through
a lot of different options

693
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,784
and talked about getting tutors,

694
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,287
and then we thought "Well, we can't
get a tutor to go over there."

695
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,999
[Courtney] Mike said, uh, "Well, he can
just live with me for three days

696
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,918
or four days a week at my house.
And the tutors can come to my house."

697
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:16,186
The whole idea was I would take him home
from school, leave him at Mike's,

698
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,689
get him tutored, take him to school.
That's how it went.

699
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:25,445
What we said was he'd pay for the tutor,
if we'd pay for the groceries.

700
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,281
And I promise you, [chuckles]
We got the short end on that deal.

701
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,834
- Your favorite show?
- Yeah.

702
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,836
- Are you serious?
- [O.C.] Yeah.

703
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,838
[O.C.]

704
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,659
See, there's three going
into the 22 right here.

705
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:17,372
The school has not prepared him
for college or even close.

706
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,375
They advanced him a grade
because he was big.

707
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,003
You know how to do long division?

708
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,424
All right. We'll go over it.

709
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,843
[Tutor] You're going to
look at the first number

710
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,345
and three goes
into six twice, right?

711
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,932
So, you're gonna write two
right here, and then...

712
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:39,477
[Money] A lot of people look up to O.C.,
like I be tellin' him all the time,

713
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,897
I wonder
where we're gonna be after football.

714
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,607
[Boys chattering]

715
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,401
You're trying to burp in my ear.

716
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,361
[Money] I picture O.C., you know,

717
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,990
playing football
in college and going pro.

718
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:57,120
And I picture me being,
like, ex-football player/manager,

719
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,746
lawyer of a football player.

720
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,416
I see myself as that guy
wearing a suit every day.

721
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,461
Y'all know y'all can't go
that way, right?

722
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,921
[Williams] Montrail
is a very sensitive person,

723
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:10,467
especially in dealing
with the death of his father.

724
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,927
[Money] I was 13 when my dad died.

725
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,805
I didn't know what to do without my dad
because my dad was my protector.

726
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,934
When he died, it was like
I knew I was on my own.

727
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:23,480
And that's when I just really
started being on my own.

728
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:28,526
You know, being a man
and working through my problems.

729
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:32,572
He told me before he died...
he said, "Take care of your grandmother

730
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,741
and get an education.

731
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,993
As high as you can go
with an education."

732
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,413
That's why I'm going there.
I was gonna say

733
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:43,291
if I wasn't gonna get
no Tennessee money,

734
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,001
I wouldn't go to school.

735
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,462
[Woman] He talked to me
about it earlier this week.

736
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,506
He was concerned
about going to college.

737
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:56,095
And that's horrible because he is...
He's very intelligent.

738
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,515
He might be able to receive

739
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,518
a little money for computers
and things like that...

740
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,937
[Kirby] I hope he goes to college.

741
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:07,565
I don't know
how he's going to do if he doesn't.

742
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,321
Dad, you know what Maggie said
in the car on the way home from the zoo?

743
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,531
No telling.

744
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:18,243
She told us that when she
listened to two different songs at once,

745
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,536
it made her bones hurt.

746
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,704
[Giggling]

747
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,252
- Maggie...
- [Maggie] You're making me nervous!

748
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:30,421
- Shut up.
- Did you say shut up to me?

749
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:31,589
I love you.

750
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,050
[Girl] She said something else funny,
I can't remember.

751
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:37,470
[Lisa] He strives to be
a good daddy to his kids.

752
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:42,100
And I believe that stems from him
not having a father growing up.

753
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,352
He was four years old
when his dad left.

754
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:49,148
So, you know, he doesn't
remember a lot about his dad... at all.

755
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:54,070
My ninth-grade year,
it was 0-0 going...

756
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,655
...like, two minutes left in the game.

757
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,324
I took a handoff, and we scored.

758
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,660
We won 8-nothin'
at the very end of the game.

759
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,496
You know, it's ninth-grade football.
Wasn't that big of a deal.

760
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,748
But, you know, you score
the winning touchdown,

761
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,166
that's a pretty cool thing.

762
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:10,336
And I remember looking up and seeing...

763
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,922
...there were
four or five of my teammates,

764
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,675
and every one of them
were walking with their dads,

765
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,677
and their dads were carrying their...

766
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,137
They put their helmets
through their shoulder pads

767
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,805
and were carrying their gear for them.

768
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,016
And they're talking about the game
and everything else,

769
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,143
and I was walking
off the field by myself.

770
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,646
I remember thinking,
"Why ain't my dad here with me?

771
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:33,610
What do those kids have that I don't?
Why do those kids have what I want?"

772
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,278
Which is a father in my life

773
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,281
and somebody to share
these kind of experiences with.

774
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,826
You start feeling
like you're not very valuable

775
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,703
because you must not be.

776
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,288
If your own father doesn't want

777
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,332
to spend time with you
or do anything for you,

778
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:51,044
you must be valueless.
You must not really have much worth.

779
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:54,005
So... fast forward to Manassas.

780
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:58,843
I know some of those kids feel that way.
And I will never be their father.

781
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:03,056
But I can sure as heck tell them
it's nothing you've done.

782
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,475
You didn't ask to be born into this,
but you were.

783
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,684
There's nothing fair about it.

784
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,645
But it also doesn't mean
there's anything wrong with you.

785
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,564
There's something
inherently wrong with that guy.

786
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:16,819
- [Boys chattering]
- [P.A. Chattering]

787
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,264
[Chavis] You know,
if he say anything...

788
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:48,267
[Courtney] Will you just tell me
what happened?

789
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,228
Chavis! Chavis!

790
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:53,022
I am driving my truck over there.

791
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,899
Would you please
don't walk away from me?

792
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,693
You're about to hurt my feelings.

793
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,364
Thank you.

794
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:10,832
I didn't ask you what's wrong with you.
My truck's here. I gotta go this way.

795
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,126
- I'm trying to ask you what happened?
- Nothing.

796
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,294
Well, then what is it? What is it?

797
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,552
- No, don't. You wanna ride with me?
- No, coach.

798
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,345
- You wanna ride with me?
- No, sir.

799
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,101
- No.
- Is that it, Chavis?

800
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:38,192
[Courtney] Hey, Chavis. Listen to me.

801
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,403
Do you really wanna bring
the team down, right now?

802
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:42,613
Oh man, you know better than that.

803
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,617
I need you to think
about what you're saying

804
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,162
and just chill for me, please.

805
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,830
Look at... Look at me.

806
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,207
- Yes, sir.
- All right?

807
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:58,463
[Sighs]

808
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:08,139
At what point...
At what point do you quit trying?

809
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:12,977
[Courtney] Chavis, please come here.

810
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,021
Come here. Chavis.

811
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,606
- Chavis.
- [Clattering]

812
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,649
- Chavis!
- [Crashing]

813
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:36,501
Everybody, in there.
Everybody in that square.

814
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,924
That's that.

815
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:47,678
That's over. That's through.

816
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:50,223
[Announcer] And we're just about ready
for football action,

817
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,974
Bolivar and Manassas...

818
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,351
Picks it up on the 30-yard line.

819
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,019
Runs around the corner,
he's got some running room.

820
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,687
Nobody's gonna be able
to get an angle on him

821
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:59,023
and going all the way
for a touchdown is the...

822
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:02,443
[Courtney] One thing and one person
will not bring this program down.

823
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,072
And we give and we bend,
and we give and we bend,

824
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,824
trying to bring folks right.

825
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:11,869
When folks don't get right,
that's that. That's all.

826
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:14,455
[Announcer] He gets across the 15!
Across the ten!

827
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,415
Touchdown Manassas!

828
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:21,212
[Courtney] It will not be spoken of,
and it will not be talked about.

829
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:25,341
The coaches will handle that.
You will handle yourselves.

830
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,846
We have a football game to win.

831
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:32,849
We have a season
to go kick everybody's butt.

832
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,852
[Announcer] Clock is just going to run
as we enter the mercy rules.

833
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:40,857
Manassas with an easy win.

834
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,275
[Courtney] Now, y'all ready
to go play some football?

835
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,860
[All] Yes, sir!

836
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,990
[Courtney] Everybody knows why we're in
here, and there's no need to tippy-toe.

837
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:52,869
Quit dressin' and listen in.
Yesterday was not a good day.

838
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,371
Chavis failed us.

839
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,376
What you got to say?
I heard you mumbling twice.

840
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:04,839
- Well, now you need to speak up.
- [Chavis] I ain't got nothin' to say.

841
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:10,094
- Chavis, you've got nothin' to say?
- [Mumbles]

842
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,221
- Speak up.
- [Chavis] I ain't got nothing to say.

843
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,389
Do you think what you did was wrong?

844
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,393
Well, I guess it's time to man up.

845
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,856
Does this team mean anything to you?

846
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:28,404
- [Player] You're lyin'!
- Where would you be?

847
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:40,082
[Courtney] It was our judgment
that a long suspension

848
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,752
was better than a termination.

849
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,546
And the reason was,
is 'cause we didn't want to lose him.

850
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,257
We felt like
if he didn't have football,

851
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:51,344
that he would really
fall off the edge.

852
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:54,722
That he might transfer,
and if he transferred,

853
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,974
that would not be
a good thing for him at all.

854
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,185
I don't know when enough is enough.

855
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:04,565
I mean... you care
about these kids a bunch, right?

856
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:08,444
So, consider... maybe not
your own family,

857
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,197
but some people
that are very close to you.

858
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:14,158
And let's say they're abusing drugs
and continue to get off drugs,

859
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,035
get on drugs,
get off drugs, get off drugs.

860
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:19,705
You know, at what point do you take
someone you love and care about

861
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:22,041
and you want to make better, at what
point do you turn your back on them

862
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:25,044
and say "I'm through screwing with you.
Goodbye. Lose my number"?

863
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,089
I mean, I don't know.

864
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:31,050
[Man] And I'll tell you one last thing.

865
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:36,555
If you don't remember the past,
history will repeat itself.

866
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:41,060
And that passion you have right now
is going to become overwhelmed

867
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:45,398
by anger, hate...
and then you gonna snap.

868
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:51,278
But if you will allow it,
football will save your life.

869
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:56,492
Allow yourself to be coached.
Allow yourself to be criticized.

870
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,579
Allow yourself to learn
how to be a leader.

871
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:03,207
And then learn how to lead.

872
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:07,837
It's in you, but you got
to allow for that to happen.

873
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,714
When it's all said and done,

874
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,091
how do you want Chavis
to be remembered?

875
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,981
[Boy] See you, O.C.!

876
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,752
You did a good job.

877
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:50,713
[O.C.] Oh, I don't know
about gettin' him off.

878
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,133
[Ethel] Some people try to say,

879
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,552
"Well, you know, here's gotta be
something in it for them."

880
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,637
And I said, "Well, no,
I don't believe that.

881
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,181
They were doing that to help O.C.,

882
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:03,559
because they wanted him
to keep up with his football career."

883
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:07,188
[Woman]

884
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:09,815
Yes, ma'am. You worry about them.
And that's good.

885
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:12,234
[Ray] Can you give her
that sheet that y'all showed me?

886
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:15,821
I'll bring that. I'll bring
the graduation rate stuff to you.

887
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:20,659
[Smith] Any time you're dealing
with a story that involves both races,

888
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,828
it can always be a lighting rod
here in this town.

889
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:25,623
[Ray] Mrs. Hayes was about to make him
quit football, or was it you?

890
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,792
- No, it was me.
- It was you. That's right.

891
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,962
- Yeah, it was Rachel.
- [Ray] That's kinda when we decided...

892
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,965
[Ethel] Mm-hmm. Gotta do somethin'.
That's when y'all came to the house

893
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:37,259
and sat down and talked to us about it.

894
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,096
That story,
when you have this black kid

895
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,890
going out and living
with this white family,

896
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,058
when you read some of the comments

897
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,061
of what people said afterwards
when they read it, it was like,

898
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,854
"They wouldn't be
doing that for this black kid

899
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:52,191
if he didn't have any athletic ability.
They only see dollar signs."

900
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,693
[Ray] There's like 67 posts here.

901
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:57,863
"It's really a shame
that it's always the superstar athlete

902
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,741
everybody is after
and everyone is willing to help."

903
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:04,286
But it just so happens that I know
a little something about football.

904
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,287
Same with Bill.

905
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:08,165
If you see
someone that's really pretty good

906
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,751
and has a chance to do something,
yeah, you're gonna wanna help them.

907
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:15,005
It would be like if you were going
out there, giving them piano lessons,

908
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:19,218
and you saw that this guy
could be a concert pianist someday.

909
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,137
So I'm going to try
to help him get better at it.

910
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,347
[Chattering]

911
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,327
[Money] Homecoming tickets are on sale.

912
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,913
Tell your mama, your daddy,
your grandma, your granddad,

913
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:50,332
aunt, uncle, sister,
brother and cousins

914
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,835
to buy your tickets
from the school and the school only.

915
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,837
Let's have a safe weekend,

916
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,964
and everybody's planning
on being at the game.

917
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,718
[Courtney] All right, listen up.

918
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,345
- Everybody paying attention?
- [All] Yes, sir.

919
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:06,348
Everybody awake?
Thinkin'? Head's on.

920
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:11,770
Fellas? We're going
to talk a lot about football,

921
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:14,857
but I'm going to take five minutes to
tell you something I want you to hear.

922
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,318
I purposely,
until we got past this game,

923
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:21,155
have not discussed the playoffs
with you. But now I'm going to.

924
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,366
If you win your district,

925
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,994
we make the playoffs.

926
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,872
Now, you ready for the good news?

927
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,250
You have an unbelievable,

928
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:35,544
that I couldn't have even dreamed of,

929
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,838
opportunity in front of you.

930
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:41,467
Because this school
was founded in 1899

931
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:46,222
and has never won
a playoff game... ever.

932
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:49,433
And this group is going
to change all that.

933
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,981
[Courtney] A hundred
and ten years, folks.

934
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,276
Not one.

935
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:05,324
Seniors, don't let the last four years,

936
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,993
don't let everything we've worked for
slip through your fingers.

937
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:15,459
- Does it mean that much to you?
- [Player] Yes, sir.

938
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,503
[Courtney] It's what you've got to be
asking yourself right now.

939
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,214
Does it really mean something?

940
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:25,427
[O.C.] To win a playoff game,
just one playoff game,

941
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,680
I mean, it is big to me.

942
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:31,934
[Money] I just feel like, you know,
this is my last chance to do it.

943
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,270
Like, I don't want to have no regrets.

944
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:44,655
[Marching band plays]

945
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:53,080
[Courtney] Good job. Good job.

946
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,624
Dexter, that's
a pretty sweet block right there.

947
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,334
- [Crowd shouting, cheering]
- [Man] Field goal!

948
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:04,133
[Courtney] Let's score here. Let's go.
22 right, motion right, dart left.

949
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,592
Good job, D!

950
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,054
Money! Money!
Let's get it right here, come on!

951
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,889
[Announcer] First and ten, Tigers.

952
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:12,975
Redmond hands it off to Parker.

953
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,436
Parker scooting his way,
Parker still running,

954
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:20,107
Parker has a first down as he gets
inside of the 30 and is driven back.

955
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:23,110
And there's a Manassas player down.

956
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,988
[Crowd yelling]

957
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:29,450
Can't tell who that is right now.
That's not good.

958
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,368
The coaching staff is coming out.

959
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:34,747
[Courtney] Talk to me, Money.

960
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,457
Talk to me, Money.

961
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:38,250
Money, talk to me.

962
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,627
- [Money muttering]
- [Courtney] Just talk.

963
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:43,047
- Put your leg flat for us.
- [Money] It hurts.

964
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:45,132
Put your leg flat.

965
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,301
[Groaning]

966
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,347
[Courtney] Hurting?
Put your weight on this one.

967
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,640
Put your weight on your right one.

968
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:56,560
- [Man] Oh, you got it.
- [Money muttering]

969
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,645
[Man] Just take your time.
You'll be all right.

970
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:00,647
- [Courtney] Thanks.
- You'll be all right.

971
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:05,402
God, I hope we didn't just lose him.

972
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:10,866
[Money] Are you going
to put them up on there?

973
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,743
- [Woman] Mm-hmm.
- [Money] I get to see it?

974
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,870
- [Woman] Mm-hmm.
- [Money] OK.

975
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:21,377
- Wow. Is that my brain?
- [Woman] No, that's your leg.

976
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,509
- Montrail, how are you?
- All right.

977
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:31,345
- Good, good to see ya.
- You looked at the pictures already?

978
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,514
- Yeah, took a peek at them.
- Looks good?

979
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:36,975
Well... Let me sit down
and talk to you here.

980
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,519
OK.

981
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,484
Your anterior cruciate ligament
has been injured.

982
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:51,573
Now, what it looks like is
a high grade partial injury.

983
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:54,535
It doesn't look like
all of the fibers have been torn.

984
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:58,956
But it looks like a large number
of them have been torn.

985
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:02,751
I know you're dying
to continue to play football here.

986
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,254
But the bottom line is that...

987
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,715
...even if we don't
end up operating on you,

988
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:11,802
you're probably going to be out
of football at least for eight weeks,

989
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:16,098
and probably 12,
while we allow this to heal.

990
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:22,521
I know that's not what you wanted
to hear, but that's the case.

991
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:23,689
And I'm sorry about that.

992
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,066
I know you're having
a big year this year,

993
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:29,445
but it's a pretty significant injury.

994
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:36,034
- All right?
- Yes, sir.

995
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:39,705
OK, we'll get you through this.

996
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,999
[Man] You know, when you come
from North Memphis...

997
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,626
- Oh, boy.
- [Congregants] Yeah!

998
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,962
[Man] When you come
from North Memphis.

999
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,006
- [Man] Hard times...
- [all] Yes.

1000
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:52,009
See, I ain't had
no good life all my life.

1001
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:54,845
- You know, I had some hard times.
- [All] Amen.

1002
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:58,515
Just to be standing here...

1003
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,309
[congregants]
Praise you, Lord! All right!

1004
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,643
[Man] We're just calling on you, Lord.

1005
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:06,231
We just ask
that you just bless O.C., Lord.

1006
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:11,069
We ask that you bless him, Lord Jesus,
on the football field, Lord.

1007
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:13,906
Just continue to bless him, Lord Jesus.

1008
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:17,534
Just give him the strength
that he needs, Lord Jesus.

1009
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,828
Let him still keep
his focus on you, Lord.

1010
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,246
[Man] Please clear your desk
of everything

1011
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:22,831
except for a number-two pencil.

1012
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,124
You're about to take the ACT test,

1013
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,043
which is composed
of multiple choice tests

1014
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:28,670
in English, math, reading and science.

1015
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:32,549
If you've already taken the writing
portion, you will take a writing test...

1016
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:35,594
[Ray] He's kinda on the borderline
of qualifying right now.

1017
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:38,138
So if he kept his GPA upward...

1018
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:42,142
If he makes a 16, he'll be in.

1019
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,144
[Man] All right, here we go.

1020
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:59,993
- Hi, I'm Ashley. Nice to meet you.
- Hi, I'm Montrail. How you doin'?

1021
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:01,495
OK, what happened?

1022
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:02,788
[Ray] We lost him.

1023
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,831
I hope there's some way we can
get him back,

1024
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:05,999
but it's probably not likely.

1025
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:09,378
You usually tear this inside ligament
when you tear your ACL.

1026
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,797
So, you're going to be doing some stuff.
Let's get on the bike.

1027
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,679
I know what he feels like right now
as far as the injury.

1028
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:22,683
'Cause you go from
being in the inner circle

1029
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,351
to where no one cares about you.

1030
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:29,147
[Courtney]

1031
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:31,942
[Money]

1032
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,569
So?

1033
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:36,780
You need to be in school.
You gotta get your grades, Money.

1034
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:41,618
[Courtney] Did you hear
what I just said?

1035
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,831
You can't be not coming to school
because you're not playing football.

1036
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,543
- Hello?
- Coach...

1037
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,962
- Huh?
- It's... It's just school.

1038
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,922
I understand your frustration,

1039
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,008
but you don't quit
because you're frustrated.

1040
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:58,260
You just keep goin'.

1041
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,138
You're better than that.

1042
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:02,889
I expect that shit
out of some of these idiots,

1043
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:05,017
- but not you.
- Yes, sir.

1044
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:07,352
[Courtney]
So, you be at school tomorrow.

1045
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:10,981
- [Laughing] Yes, sir.
- Do you hear me?

1046
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,816
All right.

1047
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:16,612
I'm gone. See y'all later.

1048
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:19,489
[Boys chattering]

1049
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:25,537
[Chavis]

1050
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:35,088
Yeah.

1051
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:45,432
[Courtney] That's his commitment.
That needs to be y'all's commitment too.

1052
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,727
- [Clapping]
- Help each other out.

1053
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,606
[Chavis] This is the beginning for me,
for the rest of my season.

1054
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:57,027
And really, for the rest
of my football career.

1055
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,821
[Money] I really don't care.
Do not care at all

1056
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:03,241
because once he put his hands on me,
I have no feelings for him.

1057
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:05,369
None whatsoever.

1058
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:11,166
You know, it was like they say,
three strikes and you're out.

1059
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:15,504
This man probably got about 50 strikes,
and he's still in the game.

1060
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:18,757
[Crowd cheering]

[Crowd cheers]

1063
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:49,246
Hey! You act like
you've never been in a game before.

1064
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:52,708
You're not playing together on defense.

1065
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:55,168
I need to know what the hell's going on
in the defensive huddle!

1066
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:56,336
Tell me right now!

1067
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:02,259
If somebody makes a mistake,
everybody hollerin' at him.

1068
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:04,094
- Yes, sir.
- Shut up!

1069
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:12,185
How many times do we gotta talk
about discipline and team first?

1070
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:14,730
See, it doesn't mean anything to you!

1071
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:18,108
Rock! You've heard it
50 times from me!

1072
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:20,360
How do you measure character?

1073
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:23,947
Somebody tell me
how to measure character!

1074
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:26,575
Somebody tell me somebody
has listened to me!

1075
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:30,078
[Chavis]

1076
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:31,788
Who said it?

1077
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:35,584
Not how you handle your successes,
but how you handle failure.

1078
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,878
Character!

1079
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,131
Six freakin' years!

1080
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:46,678
And I can't get 11 so-called leaders
to have a little bit of character!

1081
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:51,767
It has nothing to do with adjustments
on defense tonight, fellas.

1082
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:54,686
It has to do with heart and character.

1083
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:59,608
Put yourself aside, put the team first
and have a little bit of character.

1084
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:03,779
Now, I'm thinkin' about putting you at
defensive tackle for... dude's a doofus.

1085
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:07,240
I'm serious. What do you think?

1086
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:10,911
Line up over the guard
and just go through them...

1087
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,956
[crowd cheering]

1088
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,502
[Chavis]

1089
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:19,961
Huh?

1090
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,547
Go do it! Go get Kenneth out. Go do it.

1091
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:25,091
[Coach] Thank you, thank you.

1092
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,011
[Ray] You want Chavis in at two
or here in the shade?

1093
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:31,181
[Courtney] I told him to get wherever he
wanted to and get to the backfield.

1094
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:32,724
Just give him a second.

1095
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:35,852
He'll figure it out.
I'm gonna trust him.

1096
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,230
[Cheering and yelling]

1097
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:42,776
[Man] Defense! Defense! Defense!

1098
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:49,616
[Cheering]

1099
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:57,249
[Woman] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1100
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,002
[Courtney] Where's Chavis?
Where's Chavis?

1101
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:04,923
I'm proud of you.

1102
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,638
[Courtney] "In what..."
Are you listening? Good.

1103
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:15,475
"In what will go down
as one of the best performances

1104
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:17,769
in the history
of Manassas Tiger football,

1105
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:21,815
the Tigers went out east and wrecked
the homecoming for St. Benedict.

1106
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:25,318
The Tigers came into this game
with key injuries in the offensive line,

1107
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:27,737
the defensive line and the backfield.

1108
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:31,700
To take matters worse,
they found themselves in a 28-13 hole

1109
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,035
with less than one minute
to go in the first half.

1110
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,496
That's when things changed in a hurry.

1111
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,957
Chavis Daniels,
inserted defensive tackle,

1112
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,458
formed a very tough defensive line.

1113
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:42,377
This made it easier
for the rest of the defensive unit

1114
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:43,545
to run around and make plays.

1115
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,422
The Tigers would go on
to outscore St. Benedict

1116
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:48,425
27-nothin' in the third quarter,
put the game away.

1117
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:52,721
After the 54-41 victory,
the Tigers now found themselves at 5-1

1118
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,181
in the midst
of a five-game winning streak.

1119
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:57,684
This might be one
of those games the Tigers look back on

1120
01:04:57,852 --> 01:04:58,977
as a pivotal point
to their season.

1121
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:02,856
Down by just... Down by two touchdowns,
just four half and on the road.

1122
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:04,900
They could have thrown in the towel,

1123
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:07,611
but if we've learned anything
about this team after six weeks,

1124
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:10,739
it is that they are
resilient and never give up.

1125
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,908
The Tigers next test
will be Thursday night.

1126

Manassas travel to Green Hill
to take on Frayser at 7:00."

What was the word I said we were going
to talk about for just a second?

1128
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:24,419
- A hurry.
- A hurry, a snap, quick.

1129
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,339
All right, watch this.
Ready to do some math?

1130
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:30,300
- [Players] Yes, sir.
- Good. How old are you, Joaquin?

1131
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:31,760
- Eighteen.
- Eighteen.

That's 936 weeks he's been alive.

1133

I'm gonna clap to 900.
You ready? You ready?

How long will it take me
to clap to 900?

1137
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:48,360
- Eighteen years.
- A while.

1138
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:51,363
That was just 18. Watch this.

1139
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:54,699
- [Player] Four?
- Four.

1140
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:56,910
That's what's left
of your football season.

1141
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:02,290
It ain't nothin' but a snap.
It's over in a hurry.

Ask Money.

1143
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:08,046
It could be over, just like... [snaps]
That. In a hurry.

1144
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,882
So, let's do this again, right?

1145
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:14,678
If I have to clap as many times
as most of y'all have been alive,

1146
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:16,471
it's gonna take me forever.

1147
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:19,975
If I have to clap as long
as football is, it's this.

1148
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:24,437
And you're done... unless you win.

1149
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:26,564
Then what's it sound like?

1150
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:34,114
If you win...

1151
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:35,991
And if you win...

1152
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:38,827
Let's go do what we're supposed to do,
which is beat Frayser, beat Douglass,

1153
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:43,289
beat Northside, beat Kingsbury,
get in the playoffs and do our thing.

1154
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:45,834
And let's surprise everybody
in Tennessee,

1155
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:49,504
'cause there's other folks out east
of here that don't think we belong.

[Courtney] Yeah, it's real fair to say.

1163

It's discipline,
it's coaching, it's teaching.

01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:12,207
I mean, honestly?
I'm... I'm tired.

1204
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:15,668
You know? And he's tired.
And I'm ready for him to be home.

1205
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:21,466
You know, 'cause he has four children
here that need him as well.

1206
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:24,010
[Courtney] They let us fake the dive.

1207
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:26,054
[Boy] It's the end
who caught the pass, I think.

1208
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:29,682
- No, he dropped it.
- Who was going...

1209
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:31,226
Don't get on my nerves right now.

1210
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:34,354
[Courtney] I mean,
I'm exhausted all the damn time.

1211
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:39,108
It's not a hobby to me.
I mean, it's a responsibility.

1212
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:41,861
- [Boy] How the... Those slots are...
- Shh.

1213
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:44,447
...like wingbacks.
- Shh.

1214
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:48,451
[Courtney] What I give up
is emotional capital

1215
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:50,703
that I can't spend on my own family.

1216
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:53,998
You know, it's 10:45
on Saturday night,

1217
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:56,960
and I screamed at 'em two hours ago
to get out of the house.

1218
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:03,216
It's a lot.
My family gives up a ton for this.

1219
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,218
A ton.

1220
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:09,097
[Players groaning, grunting]

1221
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:16,145
[Panting] Damn!

1222
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:18,648
[O.C.] They say,
"We would like to congratu...

1223
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:21,150
...congratulate you
for being nominated

1224
01:11:21,318 --> 01:11:26,656
for consideration to play in the 2010
U.S. All-American Bowl."

1225
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:30,618
"We have completed
our roster and unfortunately,

1226
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:33,579
you were not selected
to play in this year."

1227
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:44,048
[Ray] When all this happened, it seemed
like he might get offered by everyone,

1228
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:46,926
which that hadn't happened.
I think the word's probably out.

1229
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:48,761
In fact, the guy from Colorado, he goes,

1230
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:51,973
"Well, we understand
there's some academic issues

1231
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:56,602
and he may have a hard time doing
college work out here at Colorado,"

1232
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:58,271
which is evidently
a pretty tough school.

1233
01:11:58,439 --> 01:11:59,772
[Courtney] Most of these kids

1234
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,858
think they're going to play
college football...

1235
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:04,235
until, of course, signing day's over

1236
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:09,449
and they're standing around
with a 2.0 GPA and a 14 on the ACT

1237
01:12:09,616 --> 01:12:11,993
and no football scholarship
and nowhere to go.

1238
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:16,748
And you watch them go
from playful, little boys

1239
01:12:16,915 --> 01:12:21,753
to very concerned young men
over the course of a month

1240
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:25,840
'cause it all dawns on them,
"What do I do next?"

1241
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,596
- [Money] Thank you. I'm fine.
- You got a smile on your face.

1242
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:34,223
I know the first couple of times you
come in, you weren't smiling too much.

1243
01:12:34,391 --> 01:12:36,225
But you can have a seat in here,
wherever is comfortable,

1244
01:12:36,393 --> 01:12:37,852
and Dr. Wolfe will be in
in just a minute.

1245
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,771
- OK.
- [Woman] Thank you.

1246
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:53,743
[Doctor] OK, now that feels
pretty solid right there.

1247
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:57,705
Um, all right, you can
go ahead and sit up.

1248
01:12:57,873 --> 01:13:01,584
Let me grab a stool here.
I'm very pleased with your progress,

1249
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:06,464
but I'm still... I think
it's not appropriate to be playing.

1250
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:10,927
- And...
- What if I just put a brace on it?

1251
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:12,762
Well, I agree 100 percent...

1252
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:15,014
'Cause I'm not gonna,
you know, do nothin' stupid.

1253
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:18,142
- You know, I play smart now.
- Right.

1254
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:20,061
How much of your season's left anyway?

1255
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,146
It's the last game.

1256
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:25,358
- The last game? That's it?
- Yeah. This Friday.

1257
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:27,652
This Friday. That is it?
That's the end of the season?

1258
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:31,948
Yes, sir. And I missed
every last one of 'em.

1259
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:35,701
Well... I still...
I think it's too early to play.

1260
01:13:35,869 --> 01:13:38,746
Please, this is killing me.
You know I've been depressed?

1261
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,415
- Sad...
- I know.

1262
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,542
I, look...

1263
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:43,918
Are you a senior, too?

1264
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:47,964
Yes, this is my last year.
Close to being my last time...

1265
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:51,217
I'm not going to play football
in college 'cause I'm too small anyway.

1266
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:54,554
Right... I think
I just do not want you

1267
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:59,225
on the football field
playing competitively. I really don't.

1268
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:01,727
It's just not the right thing to do.

1269
01:14:01,895 --> 01:14:03,938
I'm sorry I didn't give you
the news you wanted.

1270
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,607
- OK.
- OK. Good to see ya.

1271
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:11,320
- She'll be right with ya.
- OK.

1272
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:12,655
All right.

1273
01:14:13,365 --> 01:14:16,492
- [Door shuts]
- [Sighs]

1274
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:18,327
I'm still gonna play.

1275
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:20,329
Just get on my nerves.

1276
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:25,084
[Mumbling] Wasting my time.

1277
01:14:26,086 --> 01:14:27,462
[Ashley] So, you saw him
yesterday, right?

1278
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:29,505
- Yeah.
- What'd he say?

1279
01:14:29,673 --> 01:14:32,049
- Another two weeks.
- I think that's a good thing.

1280
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:35,428
This way, you'll feel really confident
when you go back to playin'.

1281
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:40,141
That's the thing.
Season's over with.

1282
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:43,394
You know, it's either
you win or you don't.

1283
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:44,979
- Yeah.
- You don't win, you're gone.

1284
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:49,692
Well, just make sure
your team wins that game, right?

1285
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:52,695
And then you can play the next one.

1286
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,865
All right. Get dressed.
I'll meet you out here.

1287
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,290
[Students chattering]

1288
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,306
- Hey man, I got a jersey.
- OK.

1289
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:22,350
Let me see.

1290
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:26,604
Seventy-one... I got a jersey, man.
Look good on you.

1291
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:32,151
[Chavis]

1292
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:33,402
When did he say that?

1293
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:46,040
Of all the losses, I gotta hang on
to one or two pluses.

1294
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:50,711
And... I gotta keep telling myself that
to keep myself up, because it does...

1295
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:52,421
It just, I mean...

1296
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:57,093
...of all people to think that Money is
on the cusp of being lost is...

1297
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:05,101
You know, it kills me.
But in the same respect...

1298
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:08,938
If you had looked at Money
at the beginning of the season

1299
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:10,314
and Chavis at the
beginning of the season,

1300
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:12,817
if you had to put all your money
on who was going to blow up

1301
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,860
and not handle it all,

1302
01:16:15,028 --> 01:16:17,613
would you believe Chavis
would be the one in here

1303
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:20,700
still trying to get right, and Money
be the one not at school today

1304
01:16:20,867 --> 01:16:22,577
and not doing what he's supposed to?

1305
01:16:26,164 --> 01:16:30,543
Perhaps some of you are seniors.
Your goal is to graduate.

1306
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:35,131
And once you graduate, you're going
to be going out into that big world.

1307
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:42,221
And... we want you to know that.

1308
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:47,643
In addition to that,
I am very encouraged...

1309
01:16:47,811 --> 01:16:53,774
- [clattering]
- [Indistinct]

1310
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:57,737
...to know that in this day in time,
it is most important

1311
01:16:57,904 --> 01:17:00,740
that you get a good education.

1312
01:17:00,907 --> 01:17:03,492
[Group applauding]

1313
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:06,662
On my way over to the pre-game meal,
I drove by his house.

1314
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:09,540
I said, "What is wrong, Money?"
I said, "You know, you're close."

1315
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:13,252
And he said... Before he screamed at me,
and he just looked at me

1316
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:15,630
and he had tears rolling
out of his eyes and he said,

1317
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:21,594
"You know... Can you hug me?"
And he started bawling like a child.

1318
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:24,847
He feels like he's not
part of the team anymore.

1319
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:27,099
You know, he looked out
on the practice field Thursday

1320
01:17:27,267 --> 01:17:31,187
and some freshman was wearing
54 practice jersey, and he said,

1321
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:33,689
"I couldn't help it.
It just... It killed me."

1322
01:17:33,857 --> 01:17:34,857
[Courtney] Hey, guys.

1323
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,568
Hey.

1324
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:40,988
Tonight, you have a chance
to win a district championship.

1325
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:44,700
You have a chance to secure
a position for our team in the playoffs.

1326
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:47,036
It's a huge game.

1327
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:50,998
Let's get it done.

1328
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,418
Coach, you got men...
A Most Uncommon Man.

1329
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:56,212
All right, guys...

1330
01:17:56,380 --> 01:18:01,467
The Uncommon Man of the week,
very proud of this individual.

1331
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:03,511
I'll have to admit,
at the beginning of the year,

1332
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:07,390
I had my doubts as to whether he'd even
be a part of this football team,

1333
01:18:07,557 --> 01:18:11,394
but I'm going to let
Coach Bill finish this one.

1334
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:17,566
The reason we're here, y'all,

1335
01:18:17,734 --> 01:18:19,443
is not just to win football games,

1336
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:22,113
but to reach your hearts
through something you love.

1337
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:24,448
We wanna make you better.

1338
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:29,328
And then, as individuals, if you get
better, then you get better as a team,

1339
01:18:29,496 --> 01:18:31,580
you might start seeing
that if you do something

1340
01:18:31,748 --> 01:18:35,876
for somebody other than yourself,
that you might be better for it.

1341
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:40,256
And every once in a while,
problems come up.

1342
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:44,093
Money.

1343
01:18:45,762 --> 01:18:48,180
Two things that mean most...
anything to him in the world

1344
01:18:48,348 --> 01:18:50,766
is his father and football.

1345
01:18:50,934 --> 01:18:56,397
His dad's dead, and he's scared
to death his football's dead.

1346
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,652
That's tough, and we gotta
make sure we're there for him.

1347
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:10,077
Uncommon Man of the game
was clearly Chavis.

1348
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:12,663
- He had an onside...
- [applauding]

1349
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:18,335
He had an onside kick recovery.

1350
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:20,463
He had an interception
he should have scored on.

1351
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:25,009
He was all over the field on defense,
and he stepped up and led.

1352
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:28,679
And Chavis has done
some stupid crap this year.

1353
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:31,766
That stunt he pulled
at Bolivar was off the hook.

1354
01:19:32,684 --> 01:19:34,351
But, yeah, he was
the Uncommon Man of the game.

1355
01:19:34,519 --> 01:19:36,687
But, most importantly,
he's the Uncommon Man

1356
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:40,983
because he has tried to put
a whole bunch of demons aside,

1357
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:43,235
to be part of something
bigger then himself.

1358
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:47,448
So, Chavis, you're the Uncommon Man.

1359
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:49,450
[Applauding]

1360
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:52,953
I love you.

1361
01:19:53,538 --> 01:19:55,372
There you go.
All right, y'all...

1362
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:43,147
Let's beat Kingsbury tonight.

1363
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:44,899
Bow your heads.

1364
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:55,242
Father God, I lift up this team to you.

1365
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:01,123
I lift up tonight to you.

1366
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:03,792
I'm gonna lift up
each of these kids to you.

1367
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:06,921
Ease Money's pain.

1368
01:22:08,548 --> 01:22:10,841
Stay in Chavis' life.

1369
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:12,301
[Announcer] Back in the
E.H. Crump Stadium

1370
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:14,511
and we got a doozy
for you here tonight.

1371
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:17,514
The Manassas Tigers taking
on the Kingsbury Falcons,

1372
01:22:17,682 --> 01:22:23,062
for the district title
and also for playoff seeding as well,

1373
01:22:23,229 --> 01:22:25,314
so this should be a heck of a ball game.

1374
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:29,360
[Courtney] Help us as men, Lord,
to continue to help these kids.

1375
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:33,614
Open their ears and hearts,
so they listen to us and to you.

1376
01:22:36,242 --> 01:22:38,494
Give us strength tonight.

1377
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:42,748
Win or lose, let us play with discipline
and heart and put the team first.

1378
01:22:44,834 --> 01:22:46,961
Win or lose, keep us healthy.

1379
01:22:48,922 --> 01:22:51,131
Win or lose, keep our heads right

1380
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:55,427
and let us know that you've graced us
with another week, at least.

1381
01:22:55,595 --> 01:22:58,138
And as long as we do
what your will is,

1382
01:22:58,306 --> 01:23:00,432
you'll probably grace us with another.

1383
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,851
[Crowd cheering]

1384
01:23:03,019 --> 01:23:05,104
[Courtney] Teach us to believe
in a life of love, to walk in honor,

1385
01:23:05,271 --> 01:23:07,690
and to serve you in truth.
In your son's name we pray.

1386
01:23:07,857 --> 01:23:09,608
- Amen.
- [All] Amen.

1387
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:11,193
[Announcer]
The Manassas Tigers have shown

1388
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:14,029
a valiant second-half effort tonight
in this ball game.

1389
01:23:14,197 --> 01:23:18,117
Final score:
Manassas 27, Kingsbury 16.

1390
01:23:18,284 --> 01:23:20,369
With the game,
they win the district championship.

1391
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:22,121
And more importantly, probably,

1392
01:23:22,288 --> 01:23:26,500
they also have home-field advantage
during the playoffs.

1393
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:28,002
[All praying] "Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

1394
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:29,503
on earth as it is in heaven.

1395
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:32,798
Give us this day, our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

1396
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:35,467
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil..."

1397
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:40,806
[all] Team first!

1398
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:47,813
[Gospel music playing]

1399
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,986
[Announcer] Now, let's go
to Coach Bill Courtney at Manassas.

1400
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:57,531
Tell me about your playoff situation,
coach, as much as you can.

1401
01:23:57,699 --> 01:24:00,325
Who we picked up in the playoffs?

1402
01:24:00,493 --> 01:24:01,493
Westview.

1403
01:24:01,661 --> 01:24:05,122
I'm on the way
to trade tapes with the coach.

1404
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:08,917
I'm just going to go bury myself
somewhere in a hole with a VCR.

1405
01:24:09,085 --> 01:24:11,211
- How good are you?
- Oh, we're not very good.

1406
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:13,005
Coach, you just won
six straight and beat...

1407
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:17,259
Yeah, but look, we had a tough
first four games. And starting 0-4...

1408
01:24:17,427 --> 01:24:20,262
You can "Aw, shucks" all you want,
but I'm scared to death of you guys.

1409
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:22,514
[Announcer] How do you feel
going into the playoffs?

1410
01:24:22,682 --> 01:24:24,558
[Courtney] I think we've got
the mentality, you know.

1411
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:26,143
We're going to take it
one day at a time and...

1412
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:29,521
We can beat 'em, but they can beat us.
I mean, you know, it's playoffs.

1413
01:24:29,689 --> 01:24:31,190
[Announcer] How's the health
of your team going in?

1414
01:24:31,357 --> 01:24:33,901
[Courtney] Our right tackle
is out with a knee.

1415
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,736
We may or may not
be getting him back.

1416
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:54,755
[Courtney] You know, I'll see him
Sunday night at 7:00

1417
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:56,548
in the auditorium
at the school for film.

1418
01:24:56,716 --> 01:24:59,718
And we'll be on the practice field
Monday, and we're gonna do our best

1419
01:24:59,886 --> 01:25:02,179
to try to represent
District 15 playoffs.

1420
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:06,642
[Courtney] All right, listen up.
Everybody, listen up.

1421
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:09,561
I did not spend the last
15 hours of my life

1422
01:25:09,729 --> 01:25:12,064
driving to Westview
and doing this

1423
01:25:12,232 --> 01:25:15,234
for you to sit here
and not pay attention.

1424
01:25:15,401 --> 01:25:18,904
It's gonna take some time, and we're
gonna take all the time that it needs.

1425
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:22,449
Because at 9:00 in Martin, Tennessee,

1426
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:27,246
Westview High School shows up,
and they go film from 9:00 to 12:00.

1427
01:25:27,413 --> 01:25:29,498
So, if they can do it, we can do it.

1428
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:32,334
I can remember four and five
years ago and them saying,

1429
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:35,963
"Man... Manassas in the playoffs?"

1430
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:40,384
I mean, comments like,
"I never thought I'd see the day."

1431
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:43,387
Now, Manassas
not only won a playoff game,

1432
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:46,390
but a playoff game
from one of these schools...

1433
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:48,433
You got to understand,
this school used to pay us

1434
01:25:48,601 --> 01:25:51,979
$3,000 to come up there
and get our asses beat.

1435
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:56,108
Be their homecoming queen,
give us a check, some pizza,

1436
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:58,694
and send us right back
to Memphis to where we came from.

1437
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:01,989
How amazing would it be
to take one of those schools

1438
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,032
and turn around and that be

1439
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,869
the first team we beat
in the playoffs ever.

1440
01:26:09,956 --> 01:26:12,040
- Anybody seen Montrail?
- [Student] Yeah.

1441
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:14,459
Where? Damn.

1442
01:26:14,627 --> 01:26:16,378
My bad.

1443
01:26:17,755 --> 01:26:21,300
Now look, there's going
to be limited contact today

1444
01:26:21,467 --> 01:26:23,343
- until we get the brace.
- OK, coach.

1445
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:26,180
- [Player] Hey, Coach!
- [Courtney] Hey!

1446
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:28,891
[Coach] Pick it up,
pick it up, pick it up!

1447
01:26:29,726 --> 01:26:30,934
[Indistinct talking]

1448
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:36,398
Hut!

1449
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:39,401
[Courtney] That's amazing.

1450
01:26:42,822 --> 01:26:44,823
- Is he serious?
- Dead on.

1451
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:48,202
And he's a multi-multi millionaire.
He's probably worth 30, 40 million.

1452
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:50,329
Will he really do that?

1453
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:53,248
Hey, Mike. The minute they break,

1454
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:56,418
I want first team spread
and pro huddled up.

1455
01:26:56,586 --> 01:26:59,046
Eleven on defense,
and I'll be there in a second.

1456
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,924
Hey, this is Bill Courtney.
How're you doing, bud?

1457
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:08,722
So that's a bona fide, tried and blue,
for-sure offer you just made.

1458
01:27:12,268 --> 01:27:14,853
Tears are in my eyes.
I appreciate you very much.

1459
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:19,066
OK. Bye.

1460
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:22,444
- How about that?
- Wow.

1461
01:27:22,612 --> 01:27:24,696
I thought that was pretty cool.

1462
01:27:25,615 --> 01:27:28,533
Houston, get in at right tackle
next time for Money.

1463
01:27:28,701 --> 01:27:31,703
- [Money] Dang, man. Damn.
- [Player] Come on, man.

1464
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:39,294
You're goin' back in, man.
Don't worry about it.

1465
01:27:39,462 --> 01:27:41,296
[Courtney] Come here, Money.

1466
01:27:45,301 --> 01:27:50,847
You remember when you decided you didn't
want to go the physical therapy?

1467
01:27:51,015 --> 01:27:52,516
- Yeah.
- And I told you

1468
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:55,227
that you were going to physical therapy?
You kept saying no.

1469
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:58,105
You remember why I told you
you were going to physical therapy?

1470
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:02,567
Because, if you do the right thing,
people will...

1471
01:28:02,735 --> 01:28:06,405
- See me... notice me.
...continue to help you.

1472
01:28:06,572 --> 01:28:10,409
And when you quit doing the right thing,
they'll go away as fast as they come.

1473
01:28:10,576 --> 01:28:12,369
- Do you remember that conversation?
- Yes, sir.

1474
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:14,246
You remember that, right?

1475
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:17,291
All right, well, now look at you.
You went on to therapy,

1476
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:19,543
you put your little
selfish feelings aside,

1477
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:21,169
your crying
and your bitchin' and moanin'.

1478
01:28:21,337 --> 01:28:23,046
Now you're on a football field.

1479
01:28:23,214 --> 01:28:25,799
Hopefully not playing
your last game, but at least...

1480
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:28,135
...you're a part of what we're doin'.

1481
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:31,596
Starting again, leading us like
you're supposed to and everything else.

1482
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:37,644
It's a further testament
to doing the right thing.

1483
01:28:37,812 --> 01:28:42,190
You'll be shocked at what will happen
for your life if you stay right.

1484
01:28:42,358 --> 01:28:45,986
Coach Germany has a friend
who's been very blessed.

1485
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:47,863
- He's done very well.
- OK.

1486
01:28:48,031 --> 01:28:50,073
- And he knows about your story.
- OK.

1487
01:28:50,241 --> 01:28:53,535
- And yesterday?
- Last night.

1488
01:28:53,703 --> 01:28:57,080
[Courtney] Last night, they were having
dinner and they were talkin' about you.

1489
01:28:57,248 --> 01:29:00,584
And he said, you know what?
This man doesn't know you.

1490
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:04,046
Doesn't have any idea who you are,
but he knows about you.

1491
01:29:05,214 --> 01:29:06,548
He is going to pay

1492
01:29:06,716 --> 01:29:09,634
100 percent of every dime
for your college education.

1493
01:29:22,815 --> 01:29:26,193
Absolutely 100 percent taken care of.
Everything.

1494
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:32,657
Everything.

1495
01:29:35,411 --> 01:29:36,661
Oh, God.

1496
01:29:36,829 --> 01:29:40,874
So if you can go to Austin Peay,
away from Memphis, it's taken care of.

1497
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:43,919
You can go to UT Martin,
middle of Tennessee, taken care of.

1498
01:29:44,087 --> 01:29:45,170
Somewhere in Mississippi,
taken care of.

1499
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:47,005
Somewhere in Arkansas,
Alabama, wherever.

1500
01:29:47,173 --> 01:29:49,508
Wherever you can get into school.

1501
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:52,886
Wherever you can go,
you'll get your Pell grant money,

1502
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:54,429
and stuff for your spending money.

1503
01:29:54,597 --> 01:29:57,307
But you just basically got
a 100 percent all-paid,

1504
01:29:57,475 --> 01:30:00,352
all-expenses-paid, four-year
scholarship to get your degree.

1505
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:03,146
And you ain't got to worry
about a dime of where it comes from.

1506
01:30:03,314 --> 01:30:05,315
Nothing.

1507
01:30:16,994 --> 01:30:19,371
You keep doing the right thing...

1508
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:23,208
...and good things will happen to you.

1509
01:30:26,337 --> 01:30:29,631
It's a big world out there, Money,
and it's your chance to taste it.

1510
01:30:33,886 --> 01:30:36,263
I'm so happy for you I could cry.

Now get yourself together
and get your ass back in the huddle.

[Woman] All right. "Everyone in this

There are a lot of kids around town
that are picking up

01:31:37,366 --> 01:31:38,950
scholarships to go and play football.

1521
01:31:39,118 --> 01:31:42,162
Right now, we have
Carl Coleman on the phone,

1522
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:44,998
talking about what's going on
at Manassas today.

1523
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:46,833
[Carl] Right now, Mr. O.C. Brown

1524
01:31:47,001 --> 01:31:50,712
is going to sign with Southern Miss
down in Hattiesburg.

1525
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:54,591
Everything worked out for him.
He's going to sign today.

[Applauding]

1527
01:32:00,181 --> 01:32:03,683
So now you're headed to college.
You know what you're going to study?

1528
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:06,811
Well, I kind of want to study education.

1529
01:32:06,979 --> 01:32:09,439
Be a coach. Come back and be a coach.

1530

Like I said, like I said...

1531
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:18,114

Will's 12 and Max is 11 right now.

1535
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:42,430
For the last six and half years, I've
spent more time with kids in Manassas

1536
01:32:42,598 --> 01:32:43,598
than I have my own kids.

1537
01:32:43,766 --> 01:32:46,810
I want you to stand that big man up,
find the ball and jump on him.

Go in for James.

1539
01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:53,817
Not having a father has made me
better for the kids at Manassas,

1540
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:59,531
but it's also made me kind of realize
that my time at Manassas has to be up.

1541
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:02,242
Because... how ironic would it be

1542
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:06,037
if I did so much for these kids
at Manassas, trying to teach them

1543
01:33:06,205 --> 01:33:08,873
from my life experiences
and help them as best I can,

1544
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:13,128
and then my own kids experience
some of the same hurtin' that I have?

1545
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:19,342
I want my kids to know that...
no matter what,

1546
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:22,429
they're the most important thing
in the world to their father.

1547
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:27,434
And right now, they probably are
wondering if it's them or Manassas.

1548
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:31,438
And so, that can't happen.

There's really nothing else for me
to say, except one thing.

Don't quit.

We've won nine games,
we've played ten.

Do you understand
in five of those games,

1555
01:34:16,525 --> 01:34:19,819
this team in the third quarter
was losing by seven points or more?

1556
01:34:21,113 --> 01:34:22,656
Up to 20...

and they are getting free.

man ahead of the line of scrimmage.

Here comes Omar Williams,
running with the ball.

inside the 30, 25, 20, 15,

touchdown run by Redmond.

01:38:36,118 --> 01:38:37,911
[Announcer] Leading the charge...
gives to the running back

1644
01:38:38,078 --> 01:38:42,498
and Westview's Chevy Taylor
has made it to the 43, and that is all.

1645
01:38:42,666 --> 01:38:45,668
Let's go! Now is the time, let's go!

1646
01:38:45,836 --> 01:38:47,921
[Announcer] Third and nine.
Spencer with it, gives it to DeMarcus,

1647
01:38:48,088 --> 01:38:49,005
He needs somebody to go to.

1648
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:54,010
The big O.C. Brown single-handedly
brings DeMarcus and he had some helpers.

1649
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:56,304
Manassas on the move right now.

1650
01:38:56,472 --> 01:38:58,181
Westview needs
to make something happen.

1651
01:38:58,349 --> 01:39:00,308
Huddle 'em up!

1652
01:39:00,476 --> 01:39:02,143
Pro right...

1653
01:39:02,311 --> 01:39:04,103
- Pro right, dive right.
- Dive...

1654
01:39:04,271 --> 01:39:05,855
- Dive right?
- Yes!

1655
01:39:06,023 --> 01:39:08,983
Pro right, dive right,
tell Julius to go get the linebacker.

1656
01:39:09,151 --> 01:39:10,568
Pro right, dive right.

1657
01:39:10,736 --> 01:39:13,488
They're slamming
the nose guard to the short side.

1658
01:39:13,656 --> 01:39:17,533
[Announcer] I-formation again.
Tot a mix-up on the line of scrimmage.

1659
01:39:17,701 --> 01:39:21,371
He fell on the ball, but the Chargers
say they've recovered it.

1660
01:39:21,538 --> 01:39:24,248
Westview pulls a Sneaky Pete

1661
01:39:24,416 --> 01:39:28,086
and comes up with the football
after the fumble.

1662
01:39:28,253 --> 01:39:32,632
- That was a big turnover by Manassas.
- Fuck them, fuck them!

1663
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:35,259
[Announcer] And it's stopped
the adrenaline from flowing.

1664
01:39:35,427 --> 01:39:39,973
Westview goes back on its offense.
Great field position to start.

1665
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:44,560
Here comes Spencer under center.
Gives it to... Taylor.

1666
01:39:44,728 --> 01:39:46,938
Taylor takes it inside the 15,
to the ten,

1667
01:39:47,106 --> 01:39:49,315
all the way down
to the seven-yard line!

1668
01:39:49,483 --> 01:39:53,361
And the Chargers are seven yards
away from scoring a touchdown.

1669
01:39:53,529 --> 01:39:54,988
3:28 to go!

1670
01:39:55,155 --> 01:40:00,326
Manassas defense has been unable
to stop the Chargers on this drive.

1671
01:40:00,494 --> 01:40:03,663
Big play for Westview.
Spencer under center.

1672
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:06,916
Gives to again to DeMarcus,
he found a little hole, inside the five!

1673
01:40:07,084 --> 01:40:12,088
The three! The two!
He is in the end zone!

1674
01:40:12,256 --> 01:40:14,841
Tying up Westview!

1675
01:40:15,467 --> 01:40:17,719
Chavis! Block it!

1676
01:40:17,886 --> 01:40:19,470
Block it!

1677
01:40:20,222 --> 01:40:22,932
[Announcer] Here comes the snap,
Westview to take the lead on this one!

1678
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:28,521
It's up and it is good!
Westview takes a one-point lead!

1679
01:40:28,689 --> 01:40:32,900
28-27! Three minutes to go
in the football game!

1680
01:40:33,068 --> 01:40:35,319
[Courtney] All right, let's go!
We've got this thing!

1681
01:40:39,616 --> 01:40:42,702
[Announcer] Season comes to a close
for somebody here tonight.

1682
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:52,462
- [Man] Let's go!
- All right, we gotta go.

1683
01:40:52,629 --> 01:40:54,672
- [Ray] All right...
- Let's go win it.

1684
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:56,466
Let's go win it. Let's go!

1685
01:40:57,384 --> 01:40:58,217
[Courtney] Let's go!

1686
01:40:58,385 --> 01:41:01,888
[Announcer] At the 20-yard line,
Redmond, who had the last touchdown,

1687
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:04,098
takes the ball,
and he's going to run with it!

1688
01:41:04,266 --> 01:41:06,684
Looks, scrambles from the right,
now back to the left!

1689
01:41:06,852 --> 01:41:09,312
Runs out to the right!
He comes out across the 30!

1690
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:13,274
The 35-yard line!
Out near the 42.

1691
01:41:13,442 --> 01:41:17,487
Oh, my goodness,
to get 22 yards on a first carry

1692
01:41:17,654 --> 01:41:19,405
and only eight seconds
left on the clock.

1693
01:41:19,573 --> 01:41:21,866
That's Manassas football.

1694
01:41:22,034 --> 01:41:23,910
Clock, the biggest factor right now.

1695
01:41:24,703 --> 01:41:26,412
They come out of the shotgun,
here's Redmond.

1696
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:28,122
He's gonna call his own number.

1697
01:41:28,290 --> 01:41:31,959
He is stopped, dragged,
and now gets across the 45.

1698
01:41:32,127 --> 01:41:34,087
- It's not over yet.
- Did he get it?

1699
01:41:34,254 --> 01:41:38,132
[Announcer] 28-27, we're getting
closer to field-goal range.

1700
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:40,009
- [Cheering]
- Let's go!

1701
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:43,805
[Announcer] Redmond the quarterback.

1702
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:47,683
Antonio has the ball,
he runs to the far side.

1703
01:41:47,851 --> 01:41:51,604
Westview needs to hit him.
And he goes out of bounds!

1704
01:41:53,107 --> 01:41:54,107
[Yelling, cheering]

1705
01:41:54,274 --> 01:41:58,111
Charger Jake Vincent, walking to talk
to the official, the captain.

1706
01:41:58,737 --> 01:42:00,154
It's a holding call.

1707
01:42:00,322 --> 01:42:03,157
It's a ten-yard penalty,
it's a penalty against Manassas.

1708
01:42:03,325 --> 01:42:05,493
- Oh, my!
- What happened? What'd he call?

1709
01:42:05,661 --> 01:42:08,329
- [Crowd booing]
...his face mask.

1710
01:42:08,497 --> 01:42:09,914
[Announcer] The ball is marched back

1711
01:42:10,082 --> 01:42:13,000
across the 50 to the 47-yard line
of Manassas.

1712
01:42:13,168 --> 01:42:15,336
It is third down and about 20.

1713
01:42:15,504 --> 01:42:17,213
Thirteen pass right. Hurry up.

1714
01:42:18,423 --> 01:42:21,092
[Man] This is it, y'all! Let's go!

1715
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:25,054
[Announcer] 1:03 to go,
Westview leading 28-27,

1716
01:42:25,222 --> 01:42:28,599
Manassas with the ball
back on their own 47.

1717
01:42:31,061 --> 01:42:32,603
Third and 20.

1718
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:35,189
One, two, three, four receivers.

1719
01:42:35,357 --> 01:42:38,109
Here's Redmond. He's going
to throw it, he pulls the trigger.

1720
01:42:38,277 --> 01:42:39,610
Westview's got a chance
to knock it down!

1721
01:42:40,445 --> 01:42:42,363
They intercept it!
They intercept it!

1722
01:42:42,531 --> 01:42:45,950
Coming up with the football.
The Charger...!

1723
01:42:46,118 --> 01:42:48,828
Kevin Evans!

1724
01:42:49,371 --> 01:42:51,664
1:03 to go in the ball game!

1725
01:42:51,832 --> 01:42:55,209
Evans down on the 23-yard line!
Time's up!

1726
01:42:55,377 --> 01:42:57,628
[Cheering]

1727
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:20,735
[Announcer] Westview leading it by one.
Chargers have the football.

1728
01:43:20,903 --> 01:43:24,697
Spencer takes it. Rolls to the right.
He's gonna try to run the football.

1729
01:43:24,865 --> 01:43:26,407
Here he goes!

1730
01:43:26,575 --> 01:43:31,704
Twenty, 30, 35, fights his way
up there to the 50-yard line

1731
01:43:31,872 --> 01:43:34,081
and he is dragged out of bounds...

1732
01:43:37,753 --> 01:43:40,838
Westview looks like
they have come to Memphis,

1733
01:43:41,006 --> 01:43:44,967
and upset the
Memphis Manassas Tigers.

1734
01:43:48,138 --> 01:43:50,181
[Buzzer sounds]

1735
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:52,558
[Cheering]

1736
01:44:06,323 --> 01:44:09,325
[Courtney] Six years.
We've gone from slaw...

1737
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:12,245
...to one of the
best teams in Memphis.

1738
01:44:12,663 --> 01:44:15,957
Throw your chest out,
and hold your chin up.

1739
01:44:19,044 --> 01:44:23,214
Remember the things that carry you
are the things you've been taught.

1740
01:44:23,757 --> 01:44:27,009
Character, discipline.

1741
01:44:27,177 --> 01:44:29,512
And remember, please remember,

1742
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:32,098
if you ever remember anything from me
in the last six years.

1743
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:36,060
The true measure of a man's character
is how he handles this.

1744
01:44:36,228 --> 01:44:39,689
Anybody can be a champ.

1745
01:44:39,856 --> 01:44:42,858
It takes a man to stand up when this
thing hits you in the mouth,

1746
01:44:43,026 --> 01:44:44,819
'cause it hurts.

1747
01:44:48,532 --> 01:44:50,950
I am proud to be a Manassas Tiger.

1748
01:44:54,037 --> 01:44:56,539
And I'm proud of you.

- Guess what?
- What, coach?

1752
01:45:08,593 --> 01:45:11,345
- You got to end it on the field.
- Yes, sir.

01:45:12,264 --> 01:45:14,432
- I did, seriously.
- And you gave it all you had.

- Yes, sir.
- And now you get to go have a life.

1755
01:45:18,687 --> 01:45:20,730
- I'm proud of ya.
- Thanks, coach.

1756
01:45:23,734 --> 01:45:25,860
That's correct. It is. O.C.!

1757
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:43,002

[Sniffling]

1761
01:45:56,350 --> 01:46:01,228
OK, these four years
don't happen without you.

1762
01:46:02,856 --> 01:46:06,025
It has been my honor
and my privilege.

[Sobbing]

1764
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:14,533
I was the luckiest guy in the world to
have coached you the last four years.

1765
01:46:16,328 --> 01:46:20,581
We don't do anything, we hadn't
accomplished anything without you.

1766
01:46:20,749 --> 01:46:22,083
Yes, sir.

1767
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:24,835
- I love you.
- I love you too, coach.

1768
01:46:28,131 --> 01:46:30,508
Now you go from here

1769
01:46:30,675 --> 01:46:32,760
- and you go make a life for yourself.
- [O.C. Weeping]

1770
01:46:32,928 --> 01:46:36,263
You go play ball somewhere
and you make a life for yourself.

1771
01:46:36,431 --> 01:46:37,807
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

1772
01:46:37,974 --> 01:46:40,184
- You do not look back.
- Yes, sir.

1773
01:46:50,737 --> 01:46:53,197
- I love you, buddy.
- I love you too, coach.

I'm so proud of you.

[Students cheering]

1777
01:47:50,172 --> 01:47:52,423
[Woman on PA] All football students
who are returning for next season,

1778
01:47:52,591 --> 01:47:55,426
we need you to report to the gym.
Thank you.

1779
01:47:55,594 --> 01:47:58,721
[Courtney] I think you all know,
but I'm gonna make it official,

1780
01:47:58,889 --> 01:48:01,098
I will not be coaching next year.

1781
01:48:02,684 --> 01:48:04,810
I've been here six and a half years.

1782
01:48:04,978 --> 01:48:08,856
I have never made a tackle.
I've never scored a touchdown.

1783
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:10,566
Never made a block.

1784
01:48:10,734 --> 01:48:12,860
What I'm trying to say
to you is, guys...

1785
01:48:13,028 --> 01:48:15,321
...players win games.

1786
01:48:17,115 --> 01:48:18,741
Players.

1787
01:48:18,909 --> 01:48:23,537
All coaches do is try to get
them headed in the right direction.

I'm so proud of these kids,
and I'm so proud of this program.

1789
01:48:28,835 --> 01:48:31,629
I can't say "no regrets," because I
regret we didn't win the playoff game.

1790
01:48:31,796 --> 01:48:33,297
