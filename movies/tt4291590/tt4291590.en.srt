00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,070
EVOLUTION

3
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,250
Nicolas!

4
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,350
- There's a dead boy!
- Did you go out?

5
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,250
He's underwater.

6
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,550
Have you been swimming?

7
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,350
His eyes are horrible!

8
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,250
The sea makes you think
all kinds of things.

9
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,850
Don't do it again,
you could have drowned.

10
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,050
There was a star on his belly.

11
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,250
A starfish?

12
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,250
Yes, a red one, this big.

13
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,150
Nicolas!

14
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,050
We're going to bury it.
Coming?

15
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,250
I saw a dead body.

16
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,250
It's in the water.

17
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,150
Where in the water?

18
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,150
In the sea.

19
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,250
Liar!

20
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,150
He's scared!

21
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,050
We'll bury it here.

22
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,950
Time for your medicine.

23
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,750
One,

24
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,150
two,

25
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,250
three,

26
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,250
four.

27
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,250
Why am I sick?

28
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,950
Because at your age
your body is changing

29
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,050
and weakening.

30
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,050
Like lizards?

31
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,250
In a way.

32
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,050
Like lizards or crabs.

33
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,450
When they molt, they're very fragile.

34
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,650
And starfish?

35
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,150
They only change once, at birth.

36
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,150
And afterwards?

37
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,150
Afterwards...

38
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,950
A new cycle begins.

39
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,150
A new life.

40
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,050
Drink up.

41
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,950
You frightened me before.

42
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,950
Where did you go swimming?

43
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,350
There never was any drowned boy.

44
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,950
Nicolas!

45
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,850
You're a good boy.

46
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,650
Nicolas!

47
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,950
See its mouth? It's scary.

48
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,550
You're scared of this?

49
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,050
Coward!

50
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,350
Frank!

51
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,250
Stop that!

52
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:24,850
Coward!

53
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,250
You'll stay here overnight.

54
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,050
It won't be long.

55
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,050
What will you do to me?

56
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,050
An injection.

57
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:54,050
It's nothing for a big boy like you.

58
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,250
Your mother tells me you draw a lot.

59
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,650
Yes.

60
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,050
What do you draw?

61
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,950
Animals.

62
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:29,850
Starfish.

63
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,750
Am I going to die?

64
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,550
Hang your clothes there.

65
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,050
You can't shower dressed.

66
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,750
I can do it myself.
66.

67
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,850
It'll be more fun together.

68
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,450
Come on!

69
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,350
What's that?

70
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,750
I'd love to see your drawings.

71
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,850
I can keep a secret.

72
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,750
Thank you.

73
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,150
It's beautiful.

74
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,750
I'll count 10 and it'll be over.

75
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:06,950
One,

76
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,150
two,

77
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,750
Three,

78
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,750
four,

79
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,750
five,

80
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:45,650
six,

81
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:50,950
seven,

82
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,050
eight,

83
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,050
nine,

84
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:08,950
Ten.

85
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,850
Look, what they did to me.

86
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,250
They did it to us all.

87
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,850
Are we all sick?

88
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,650
Where are you going?

89
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,750
Don't you want to come home?

90
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,750
Victor!

91
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:56,850
Victor!

92
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,550
Victor!

93
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,750
Are you coming?

94
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,150
- Where?
- They're lying to us.

95
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,250
Let's see what they do at night.

96
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,950
Are you coming?

97
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,150
We're going to get lost.

98
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,050
No, we're not.
Come on!

99
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,950
How long do we have to stay here?

100
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,250
They're lying.

101
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,850
We won't get better.

102
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:42,850
Where's Victor?

103
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,850
Look what I have for you.

104
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:34,850
What's that?

105
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:36,850
A Ferris wheel.

106
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:44,750
And what does this wheel do?

107
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:47,150
You get on it

108
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:49,350
and it spins around.

109
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,150
Children!

110
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,150
I have good news.

111
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:43,050
Your friend Victor has been cured.

112
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,950
He sent you this.

113
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:11,950
More!

114
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,850
What are you doing?

115
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:20,050
Do you want them to force-feed you?

116
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:27,150
Give me that!

117
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:29,750
Give me that!

118
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:36,150
Get back into bed!

119
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:37,850
Obey me!

120
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:39,550
Obey your mother!

121
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:41,450
You're not my mother!

122
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:01,850
Nicolas...

123
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:06,950
Nicolas!

124
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,150
They took them all.

125
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:06,350
You know,

126
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:08,950
my mother's not my mother either.

127
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:58,750
Here.

128
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:04,950
Shall we draw?

129
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:37,350
You don't draw?

130
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:45,650
Show me.

131
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:53,350
Draw something.

132
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,750
Shall I tell you a secret?

133
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:37,850
Yes.

134
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:06,150
Can you feel it?

135
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:12,750
Yes.

136
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:23,050
Here he is!

137
01:16:57,850 --> 01:16:58,950
Stella!

138
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:04,950
Come back!

139
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:10,050
Stella!

140
01:17:11,305 --> 01:18:11,250
