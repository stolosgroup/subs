00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:13,849
<i>To the naked eye,</i>

4
00:01:13,884 --> 00:01:16,752
<i>a suit appears to consist
of two parts:</i>

5
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:19,056
<i>a jacket and trousers.</i>

6
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:25,996
<i>But those two
seemingly solid parts</i>

7
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:29,732
<i>are composed of
four different fabrics.</i>

8
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:35,973
<i>Cotton, silk, mohair and wool.</i>

9
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:42,079
<i>And those four fabrics are
cut into 38 separate pieces.</i>

10
00:01:43,113 --> 00:01:47,783
<i>The process of sizing, forming,
conjoining those pieces</i>

11
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:52,755
<i>requires no fewer than
228 steps.</i>

12
00:02:26,957 --> 00:02:30,160
<i>So the first step
is measurement.</i>

13
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:54,017
<i>But "measurement" doesn't mean,
uh, just reaching for your tape,</i>

14
00:02:54,051 --> 00:02:56,819
<i>"So many inches here,
so many inches there."</i>

15
00:02:56,852 --> 00:02:58,721
<i>No, no, no.</i>

16
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:30,686
<i>You cannot make something good</i>

17
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,991
<i>until you understand
who you're making it for.</i>

18
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:44,101
<i>All clothing says something.</i>

19
00:03:44,134 --> 00:03:47,237
<i>I've had gentlemen
walk into my shop and boast,</i>

20
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,973
<i>"Oh, I don't care about
what I wear."</i>

21
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:55,112
<i>And assuming that's true,
doesn't that say something, too?</i>

22
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,861
<i>So, who is your customer?</i>

23
00:04:11,895 --> 00:04:13,964
<i>And what are you trying to say
about him?</i>

24
00:04:18,068 --> 00:04:23,006
<i>A man walks through your door,
what about him can you observe?</i>

25
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:24,274
Good morning.

26
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:26,109
<i>Is he timid,</i>

27
00:04:26,143 --> 00:04:29,246
<i>hunched over
like a midday clock?</i>

28
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,781
<i>Or does he stand
with confidence,</i>

29
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:35,185
<i>spine at six and twelve?</i>

30
00:04:35,986 --> 00:04:40,257
<i>Is this a man
of springtime pastel,</i>

31
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,026
<i>clamoring to be noticed?</i>

32
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:47,464
<i>Or is this a man
of gray and brown,</i>

33
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:51,834
<i>blending into the hurried crowd?</i>

34
00:04:51,867 --> 00:04:55,804
<i>Is this a man comfortable
in his station?</i>

35
00:04:58,108 --> 00:05:01,211
<i>Or does he pine
for grander things?</i>

36
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,983
<i>And who would this man
like to be?</i>

37
00:05:12,088 --> 00:05:14,124
<i>And who is he underneath?</i>

38
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:54,998
<i>Take your measure...</i>

39
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,004
<i>...and when you understand
who he is...</i>

40
00:06:06,176 --> 00:06:07,911
Mr. Boyle.

41
00:06:07,944 --> 00:06:10,080
<i>...then you're ready to begin.</i>

42
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:12,983
Knock, knock.

43
00:06:13,016 --> 00:06:15,018
- Hmm.
- How's business, English?

44
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:16,886
Evening, sirs.

45
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:27,063
- Oh, wow. It's a nice one.
- Mm-hmm.

46
00:06:27,097 --> 00:06:28,298
Yeah, that's really nice.

47
00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:29,832
You making that for my pops?

48
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:31,268
Not this one.

49
00:06:31,301 --> 00:06:34,070
You're making those fine threads
for somebody else? Who?

50
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:37,873
Master Richie, you know
I can't talk about my gentlemen.

51
00:06:37,907 --> 00:06:40,977
Huh. Is that what we are?
Your gentlemen.

52
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:44,180
Whoa, get a load of English.

53
00:06:44,214 --> 00:06:46,149
Keeping his lips shut tight.

54
00:06:50,987 --> 00:06:53,023
- Your father was here.
- Oh, yeah?

55
00:06:53,056 --> 00:06:55,358
Uh... yesterday.

56
00:06:55,392 --> 00:06:57,860
He said your business

57
00:06:57,894 --> 00:06:59,429
is undergoing
some manner of expansion.

58
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:02,165
He said I should plan on making
you a new suit to celebrate.

59
00:07:02,198 --> 00:07:04,167
Francis, what do you think?
New threads?

60
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,834
Long as we're here?

61
00:07:05,868 --> 00:07:07,070
- Not tonight.
- Hey, come on. We got time.

62
00:07:07,103 --> 00:07:09,306
Not tonight.

63
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:11,408
Oh, shit.

64
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:13,376
Is that from the Outfit?

65
00:07:19,082 --> 00:07:21,184
English, do me a favor.

66
00:07:21,217 --> 00:07:23,386
Why don't you, uh, go up front,

67
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,356
check on your secretary
for me, all right?

68
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:29,426
Will you excuse me, gentlemen.

69
00:07:30,427 --> 00:07:31,961
It's the Outfit, man.

70
00:07:31,995 --> 00:07:34,397
It's his brass ring right here.

71
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:37,233
Right, go ahead, open it up.
See what it says.

72
00:07:54,117 --> 00:07:55,352
Any mail?

73
00:07:55,385 --> 00:07:57,220
Do you want to talk about it?

74
00:07:57,253 --> 00:07:59,222
The mail?

75
00:07:59,255 --> 00:08:00,924
That they gave you the boot.

76
00:08:02,258 --> 00:08:03,927
What's in the box?

77
00:08:04,928 --> 00:08:06,062
That one's mine.

78
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:07,297
Let's have a look.

79
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,165
Okay.

80
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,201
No, no, let me guess.

81
00:08:11,234 --> 00:08:14,104
Uh, the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

82
00:08:14,137 --> 00:08:15,305
Mm-mm.

83
00:08:15,338 --> 00:08:16,973
I've never understood
the appeal.

84
00:08:17,006 --> 00:08:19,075
All it does is lean.

85
00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:20,910
The Eiffel Tower?

86
00:08:20,944 --> 00:08:22,278
I already have that.

87
00:08:22,312 --> 00:08:25,248
Well, then I give up.

88
00:08:29,052 --> 00:08:30,286
What is that?

89
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:33,390
I'll show you.

90
00:08:38,261 --> 00:08:40,196
Ah-ha.

91
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,531
I feel at home again.

92
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:43,066
Isn't it beautiful?

93
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:45,001
It's a clock.

94
00:08:45,034 --> 00:08:46,536
Unlike some of us,
I've never seen it in person.

95
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:48,171
In person, it's still a clock.

96
00:08:48,204 --> 00:08:50,039
On the banks of the Thames.

97
00:08:50,073 --> 00:08:51,708
- You've seen clocks in Chicago?
- Yes, of course, but...

98
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:54,978
They look startlingly similar
in London.

99
00:08:55,011 --> 00:08:57,447
Okay.

100
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,416
I will never understand you.

101
00:09:00,183 --> 00:09:05,021
Well, you will never be
a-a dashing gentleman

102
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:08,024
of a certain age.

103
00:09:08,057 --> 00:09:10,960
You've been all over the world.

104
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:15,999
You could have a shop
anywhere you like.

105
00:09:16,032 --> 00:09:17,267
And yet you're here.

106
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,169
What's wrong with here?

107
00:09:22,238 --> 00:09:25,041
I can think of a few things.

108
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:27,143
Some things
one finds everywhere, dear.

109
00:09:27,177 --> 00:09:30,313
So it doesn't terribly much
matter where I am.

110
00:09:30,346 --> 00:09:31,481
I have me shears.

111
00:09:32,282 --> 00:09:34,984
What else does a man need
besides his shears?

112
00:09:35,018 --> 00:09:37,053
And I have you.

113
00:09:41,224 --> 00:09:42,325
Not forever.

114
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:45,995
Ah, yes.

115
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:47,230
Ben awaits.

116
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:54,471
One way or another...

117
00:09:56,172 --> 00:09:58,208
...I'm getting out of here.

118
00:09:58,241 --> 00:09:59,309
To London?

119
00:10:00,376 --> 00:10:02,345
To London.

120
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:04,447
And Madrid.

121
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:06,082
- And Barcelona.
- Mm.

122
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:08,117
And Morocco.

123
00:10:08,151 --> 00:10:09,252
And to Paris.

124
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:15,058
You know what'd make it
happen a lot sooner?

125
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:16,059
A map?

126
00:10:16,092 --> 00:10:17,560
A raise. Please.

127
00:10:17,594 --> 00:10:19,629
I best go see
if Master Richie needs me.

128
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:21,331
Ah.

129
00:10:21,364 --> 00:10:23,266
Speak of the devils.

130
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:24,400
What's that now?

131
00:10:24,434 --> 00:10:26,236
Just an expression, sirs.

132
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:27,804
Excuse me.

133
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:30,139
I meant no offense.

134
00:10:33,142 --> 00:10:34,544
See you tomorrow.

135
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:41,210
The horologist's apprentice
popped in yesterday.

136
00:11:41,244 --> 00:11:42,312
He's awfully nice.

137
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:44,380
S... What'd he... uh, who-who?

138
00:11:44,414 --> 00:11:46,115
From down the street.

139
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:48,184
He's ever so handsome.

140
00:11:50,219 --> 00:11:52,589
Are you... trying to get me
to go on a date

141
00:11:52,622 --> 00:11:55,158
with the guy who works
at the watch shop?

142
00:11:55,191 --> 00:11:58,328
He's an apprentice
to the horologist.

143
00:11:58,361 --> 00:12:00,296
The one with
the little mustache?

144
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,899
Yes, like Errol Flynn.

145
00:12:01,932 --> 00:12:04,667
I do not need you telling me
who to date.

146
00:12:04,701 --> 00:12:06,603
I didn't mean it like that.

147
00:12:06,636 --> 00:12:10,139
You meant it like, "I saw you
smiling at Richie Boyle earlier

148
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:11,407
"and now I'm petrified

149
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:13,276
that you're running
with a bad batch."

150
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:17,280
Those men may be customers,
but they are not gentlemen.

151
00:12:17,313 --> 00:12:20,149
Could've fooled me in those
nice clothes you make for 'em.

152
00:12:20,183 --> 00:12:22,719
If we only allowed angels
to be customers,

153
00:12:22,752 --> 00:12:24,721
soon we'd have
no customers at all.

154
00:12:24,754 --> 00:12:27,624
Do we let all of our customers
keep lockboxes in back?

155
00:12:27,657 --> 00:12:30,226
It was you
who was smiling at him.

156
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:31,594
I've spent my entire life

157
00:12:31,628 --> 00:12:33,496
around animals
like Richie Boyle.

158
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:35,765
You want to get him to back off,
you look him dead in the eyes

159
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:37,367
and you pretend
you're one of 'em.

160
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,235
You don't need me worrying
after you.

161
00:12:39,268 --> 00:12:41,304
- That's right.
- You can take care of yourself.

162
00:12:41,337 --> 00:12:42,572
You're not my...

163
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,541
- You know.
- I do.

164
00:12:45,575 --> 00:12:47,644
My father was a shit,
so y-y-y...

165
00:12:47,677 --> 00:12:49,245
Take that as a compliment.

166
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:51,280
I will.

167
00:13:05,561 --> 00:13:07,965
I know...

168
00:13:07,998 --> 00:13:10,233
that you hope that
I'll start loving this

169
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:12,335
- the way that you do.
- No. I don't.

170
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:14,771
- I don't.
- That I'll train...

171
00:13:14,804 --> 00:13:17,674
learn the craft.

172
00:13:17,707 --> 00:13:20,610
One day maybe even
take over the shop.

173
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:25,748
But I don't want that.
I don't want your life.

174
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:30,286
You're entitled to your own.

175
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:32,255
- I am.
- You're a smart young woman

176
00:13:32,288 --> 00:13:33,322
who's going to take herself

177
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:34,757
- far away from here.
- I will.

178
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:38,561
And when I go, I just don't
want you to be all alone.

179
00:13:42,032 --> 00:13:45,368
I don't need you
looking after me either.

180
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,339
After all,
you're not my, you know.

181
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,315
Fair enough.

182
00:13:59,348 --> 00:14:01,584
Now, if you want that raise,

183
00:14:01,617 --> 00:14:06,756
first you have to learn
what a bloody square looks like.

184
00:15:56,866 --> 00:15:58,835
We gotta find the keys.

185
00:16:00,436 --> 00:16:02,705
Uh...

186
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:03,907
They were right here.

187
00:16:03,941 --> 00:16:05,943
And... what did I do with them?

188
00:16:05,976 --> 00:16:08,444
♪ Well, that's what they say ♪

189
00:16:11,747 --> 00:16:14,383
Hey. What's this book do,
by the way?

190
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:15,585
I always wondered what this was.

191
00:16:15,618 --> 00:16:16,954
Richie.

192
00:16:16,987 --> 00:16:18,521
Don't touch anything.

193
00:16:18,554 --> 00:16:19,957
Hey.

194
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,724
Mm.

195
00:16:21,757 --> 00:16:23,626
- I just said don't touch anything.
- These are gorgeous.

196
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:25,461
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

197
00:16:25,494 --> 00:16:28,165
He likes things
the way that he likes them.

198
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:29,967
Okay.

199
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,401
What a fucking buster, huh?

200
00:16:32,435 --> 00:16:34,905
He cares about what he does,

201
00:16:34,938 --> 00:16:36,806
and that's why
he's the best at it.

202
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:37,874
Yeah.

203
00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:41,178
Like... somebody else I know.

204
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:43,180
Hmm.

205
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:44,948
What is that?
Are you fucking with me?

206
00:16:44,982 --> 00:16:46,482
What?

207
00:16:46,515 --> 00:16:47,783
I said, are you fucking with me?

208
00:16:47,817 --> 00:16:49,552
- Like, are you making fun? Huh?
- No.

209
00:16:49,585 --> 00:16:50,853
- No, Richie, baby.
- 'Cause I'm no goddamn joke.

210
00:16:50,888 --> 00:16:53,522
I'm not making fun.
I'm not making fun.

211
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:56,592
Come here.

212
00:16:57,827 --> 00:17:00,529
Baby, what's wrong?

213
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:04,201
- Did he do something?
- Did who do something?

214
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:06,435
Francis.
Did he do something again?

215
00:17:06,469 --> 00:17:07,971
Fuck Francis.

216
00:17:08,005 --> 00:17:09,572
- He ain't family.
- I know.

217
00:17:09,605 --> 00:17:10,806
Hmm.

218
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,009
- He ain't even Irish.
- I know.

219
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:16,046
He thinks we got a rat.

220
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,015
- Okay.
- Yeah.

221
00:17:18,048 --> 00:17:19,849
Somebody leaking
to the La Fontaines.

222
00:17:19,883 --> 00:17:21,517
Who?

223
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,818
Doesn't fucking matter.

224
00:17:22,852 --> 00:17:24,553
- He's paranoid. All right?
- All right.

225
00:17:24,587 --> 00:17:26,656
And he's been telling my pops
for months.

226
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:28,959
My pops fucking listens, too.

227
00:17:28,992 --> 00:17:32,595
"Hey, Francis,
you know, he's so smart.

228
00:17:32,628 --> 00:17:34,797
You can really learn
a thing or two from that kid."

229
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,934
Baby, you're the number two.

230
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:38,534
Your pops listens to you.

231
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:39,802
Don't worry about Francis.

232
00:17:39,835 --> 00:17:41,671
Who cares about Francis?

233
00:17:41,704 --> 00:17:46,243
You think I don't know what
Francis did for my pops? Hmm?

234
00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:48,045
You think I haven't heard
about it

235
00:17:48,078 --> 00:17:50,513
a thousand fucking times?

236
00:17:50,546 --> 00:17:52,950
Six marbles. I fucking get it.

237
00:17:52,983 --> 00:17:55,584
But that's only 'cause
I wasn't there.

238
00:17:55,618 --> 00:17:56,954
'Cause if I had been there,

239
00:17:56,987 --> 00:17:58,055
- that would've been me.
- Would've been you.

240
00:17:58,088 --> 00:17:59,822
You know that, right?

241
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:02,692
Francis thinks he can
make moves with my pops,

242
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:04,928
my fucking pops,

243
00:18:04,962 --> 00:18:06,696
without me.

244
00:18:08,597 --> 00:18:09,832
Fuck was that?

245
00:18:11,001 --> 00:18:12,835
I don't...

246
00:18:25,983 --> 00:18:27,516
Shut up.

247
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,919
Okay. Sorry.

248
00:18:28,952 --> 00:18:30,519
Geez.

249
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:35,491
I don't want to wake him up.

250
00:18:36,726 --> 00:18:39,062
Hey.

251
00:18:39,096 --> 00:18:41,497
- Looking for these?
- That's where...

252
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:45,035
You know what I like about you?

253
00:18:45,068 --> 00:18:46,602
What?

254
00:18:46,635 --> 00:18:48,105
You're going places.

255
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:50,773
Goddamn right I'm going places.

256
00:18:50,806 --> 00:18:52,608
Mm.

257
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:54,311
- Whoa.
- Out that door.

258
00:18:54,344 --> 00:18:56,746
Whoa, whoa.

259
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:09,993
<i>Step two is drawing.</i>

260
00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:18,734
<i>And for some, this can be
the most purely enjoyable step.</i>

261
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,841
<i>You're only just exploring.</i>

262
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:51,902
<i>But I will caution you
to heed your patterns.</i>

263
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:56,973
<i>They're there for a reason.</i>

264
00:19:58,175 --> 00:20:00,643
<i>This isn't art.</i>

265
00:20:00,676 --> 00:20:02,678
<i>This is a craft.</i>

266
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,616
<i>We can talk about
shocking originality later.</i>

267
00:20:13,656 --> 00:20:15,691
<i>The point now...</i>

268
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:18,727
<i>...is skill.</i>

269
00:20:46,189 --> 00:20:48,992
<i>Your patterns,
your proven forms,</i>

270
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:51,128
<i>they aren't your enemies.</i>

271
00:20:54,164 --> 00:20:56,832
<i>They're the only friends
you have.</i>

272
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,210
Shh!

273
00:21:42,312 --> 00:21:44,713
- Motherfuckers!
- Quiet.

274
00:21:44,747 --> 00:21:46,016
- Fucking dead!
- Quiet.

275
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:47,184
Yeah, back up, back up.

276
00:21:59,095 --> 00:22:01,131
- What's going on?
- Is anybody else here?

277
00:22:01,164 --> 00:22:02,265
Please, sirs,
I don't want any trouble.

278
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:04,201
Is anybody else here?

279
00:22:04,234 --> 00:22:05,235
No, no, no, sir.

280
00:22:05,268 --> 00:22:06,336
All right, back room.

281
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:07,803
Move, move, move. Come on.

282
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:10,106
Let's go.

283
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,342
We got ya. Don't worry.

284
00:22:14,277 --> 00:22:16,279
Come on, English.

285
00:22:16,313 --> 00:22:18,048
All right.

286
00:22:19,983 --> 00:22:21,750
- All right.
- Shit, shit.

287
00:22:21,784 --> 00:22:23,086
- All right, get the coat, get the coat. Come on.
- Shit.

288
00:22:25,222 --> 00:22:27,123
Fuck!

289
00:22:28,191 --> 00:22:29,326
Shit.

290
00:22:31,127 --> 00:22:32,929
Come on, help me lift him.

291
00:22:34,164 --> 00:22:35,864
Come on.

292
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:37,833
All right.

293
00:22:37,866 --> 00:22:40,036
Fuck.

294
00:22:42,272 --> 00:22:44,107
Fuck.

295
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,042
Fuck. Shit.

296
00:22:46,076 --> 00:22:49,012
Fuck.

297
00:22:49,045 --> 00:22:50,313
- Fuck.
- Grab some of that fabric,

298
00:22:50,347 --> 00:22:52,349
hold it, hold it up here
against the wound.

299
00:22:52,382 --> 00:22:54,284
Ah! Fuck! Fucking hurts!

300
00:22:54,317 --> 00:22:56,920
It hurts because there's a hole
in your stomach.

301
00:22:56,953 --> 00:22:59,055
Do you remember why
there's a hole in your stomach?

302
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:01,191
There's a hole in your stomach
because back there,

303
00:23:01,224 --> 00:23:03,960
when it was time for you
to pull the trigger, you froze.

304
00:23:03,994 --> 00:23:05,562
- Fuck you.
- Yeah, fuck me later.

305
00:23:05,595 --> 00:23:07,163
Right now, shut up.

306
00:23:07,964 --> 00:23:10,267
English, I need you
to listen carefully.

307
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,269
There are a thousand
blue boys out there

308
00:23:12,302 --> 00:23:15,804
hunting for this, and if they
find it, I start shooting.

309
00:23:15,838 --> 00:23:17,974
You follow?
Making matters worse,

310
00:23:18,008 --> 00:23:19,276
there are a thousand
racket boys out there

311
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:20,809
hunting for it, too,
and if they find it,

312
00:23:20,843 --> 00:23:22,412
they start shooting.
You follow?

313
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:23,880
- I think he fucking gets it.
- Shut up.

314
00:23:23,913 --> 00:23:25,081
Let me hear it.

315
00:23:25,115 --> 00:23:27,250
Uh, there's, there's
a thousand people

316
00:23:27,284 --> 00:23:29,085
looking for that briefcase.

317
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:32,589
It would be safest all around
if none of 'em get it.

318
00:23:32,622 --> 00:23:34,224
Good man.

319
00:23:34,257 --> 00:23:35,358
Keep the pressure on.

320
00:23:35,392 --> 00:23:37,294
Fuck.

321
00:23:38,328 --> 00:23:40,964
Are you calling my pops?

322
00:23:40,997 --> 00:23:42,098
Hey, prick!

323
00:23:42,132 --> 00:23:44,901
You fucking prick. Fuck.

324
00:23:47,904 --> 00:23:50,907
Boss, the La Fontaines
jumped us.

325
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,342
The whole crew was waiting.

326
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,010
They knew when we were gonna be there...

327
00:23:54,044 --> 00:23:55,045
- Fuck.
- ...they knew what we had with us,

328
00:23:55,078 --> 00:23:57,047
they knew where we were.

329
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,282
What have I been saying
about a rat?

330
00:23:59,316 --> 00:24:01,217
I told you.

331
00:24:01,251 --> 00:24:04,387
Yeah, yeah.
No, no, we still have it.

332
00:24:06,089 --> 00:24:10,060
Uh, no, Richie and I ran
to the safest place nearby.

333
00:24:10,093 --> 00:24:11,294
Tailor's shop.

334
00:24:11,328 --> 00:24:14,397
And, uh, yeah,
Richie took a marble.

335
00:24:14,431 --> 00:24:16,966
Yeah, well, he, he's not
gonna be playing for the Cubs

336
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,336
anytime soon,
but he-he'll, he'll be okay.

337
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:22,439
I... He'll be okay.

338
00:24:22,472 --> 00:24:24,873
You want to send the doc anyway?

339
00:24:26,676 --> 00:24:28,111
Well, w-we, we can come.

340
00:24:29,112 --> 00:24:30,413
Now?

341
00:24:30,447 --> 00:24:33,917
All of La Fontaine's spots?
That's war.

342
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,954
Then I guess it's D-Day.

343
00:24:40,924 --> 00:24:43,059
- Fuck he say?
- Listen to me, pal.

344
00:24:44,294 --> 00:24:46,162
Nobody knows where the doc is.

345
00:24:46,196 --> 00:24:48,098
Pops is gonna come
down here himself,

346
00:24:48,131 --> 00:24:49,299
but it's gonna take a while.

347
00:24:49,332 --> 00:24:51,000
What the f... fuck is a while?

348
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:53,002
- Take me home.
- Pops says wait here.

349
00:24:53,036 --> 00:24:55,438
When you got marbles in your
belly, you can stay, all right?

350
00:24:55,472 --> 00:24:57,040
- I'm-I'm leaving.
- Hey, hey.

351
00:24:57,073 --> 00:24:58,174
I've had marbles in my belly,
remember?

352
00:24:58,208 --> 00:24:59,242
Six shots. Fuck you!

353
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:01,111
You work for me, and I'm saying

354
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:02,245
take me the fuck home!

355
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:03,446
I work for your father,

356
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,048
and your father says
we stay put.

357
00:25:05,081 --> 00:25:07,117
Motherfuck...

358
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,985
Fuck!

359
00:25:09,018 --> 00:25:10,253
He needs a doctor.

360
00:25:10,286 --> 00:25:12,088
Oh, you think?

361
00:25:14,524 --> 00:25:16,326
- Fuck!
- Down here.

362
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,927
- Move, move!
- Shh!

363
00:25:25,402 --> 00:25:27,103
You fucking prick.

364
00:25:27,137 --> 00:25:29,005
- He's losing too much blood.
- Push harder.

365
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:30,440
The wound needs to be sealed.

366
00:25:30,473 --> 00:25:32,142
Oh, are you a doctor now, too?

367
00:25:32,175 --> 00:25:34,210
- I was in the war.
- At your age?

368
00:25:34,244 --> 00:25:35,545
The other war.

369
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:40,016
Let me see.

370
00:25:42,552 --> 00:25:44,320
Yeah, the marble went through.

371
00:25:44,354 --> 00:25:47,357
I've been in a war, too,
just not the overseas kind.

372
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,292
Yeah.

373
00:25:49,325 --> 00:25:52,095
We have to stop this bleeding.
He needs a hospital.

374
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,296
Sew him up.

375
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:55,064
What?

376
00:25:55,098 --> 00:25:57,033
You got a needle and thread
around here someplace.

377
00:25:57,066 --> 00:25:59,202
- Not that kind.
- Sew him up.

378
00:25:59,235 --> 00:26:01,004
I can't. I don't know how.

379
00:26:01,037 --> 00:26:03,006
Sewing skin is not the same...

380
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,942
Sew him up.

381
00:26:15,218 --> 00:26:16,953
If he's bleeding internally...

382
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:31,768
Fuck.

383
00:26:38,174 --> 00:26:40,210
Shh.

384
00:26:41,277 --> 00:26:43,012
Fuck.

385
00:26:43,046 --> 00:26:44,614
Fuck.

386
00:26:44,647 --> 00:26:46,382
What... the fuck is he doing?

387
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:48,218
He's fixing you up. Stay still.

388
00:26:48,251 --> 00:26:49,419
No fucking way, he isn't.

389
00:26:49,452 --> 00:26:51,087
No, no, no, no, no, no.

390
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,356
I think we should,
uh, we-we can, um...

391
00:26:53,389 --> 00:26:54,791
Go on, do it quick.

392
00:26:54,824 --> 00:26:56,059
...come up with
a different plan, yeah?

393
00:26:56,092 --> 00:26:57,393
Shh.

394
00:26:58,828 --> 00:27:01,264
Actually, I think I'm good.

395
00:27:05,101 --> 00:27:06,369
Hold him.

396
00:27:06,402 --> 00:27:08,371
- Nuh-uh.
- Fuck.

397
00:27:08,404 --> 00:27:10,507
If I run away,
you can run after me,

398
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,542
catch me and murder me then.

399
00:27:15,245 --> 00:27:17,814
- Keep your hands steady.
- Get the fuck...

400
00:27:17,847 --> 00:27:19,249
fuck away from me, both of you.

401
00:27:19,282 --> 00:27:20,650
Right, come on.

402
00:27:22,418 --> 00:27:23,653
Pull him this way.

403
00:27:31,661 --> 00:27:33,363
Ow! Fuck!

404
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:41,838
One more.

405
00:27:41,871 --> 00:27:44,340
Fuck!

406
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:48,444
Fuck!

407
00:27:48,478 --> 00:27:50,113
Get my, get my tweezers.

408
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,592
Scissors.

409
00:28:04,193 --> 00:28:05,295
Cut that.

410
00:28:08,464 --> 00:28:09,599
All right.

411
00:28:10,901 --> 00:28:13,136
Turn him over.

412
00:28:14,704 --> 00:28:16,573
Careful, careful.

413
00:28:26,282 --> 00:28:27,550
Good boy.

414
00:28:36,192 --> 00:28:38,161
Scissors.

415
00:28:52,241 --> 00:28:54,510
He'll be okay.

416
00:29:39,422 --> 00:29:41,524
Stay here with Richie,
wait for the boss.

417
00:29:41,557 --> 00:29:43,259
You're leaving?

418
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:44,560
I'll be back.

419
00:29:45,561 --> 00:29:47,463
Take Master Richie with you.

420
00:29:47,497 --> 00:29:49,699
This is the safest place
right now.

421
00:29:49,732 --> 00:29:52,802
Please, at least take
that-that thing with you.

422
00:29:52,835 --> 00:29:54,404
Too many hard boys out there.

423
00:29:54,437 --> 00:29:56,372
You-You've been loyal customers.

424
00:29:56,406 --> 00:29:58,241
I depend upon you.

425
00:29:58,274 --> 00:30:01,611
Not once, not once have I ever
asked about your business.

426
00:30:01,644 --> 00:30:03,646
I don't, I don't judge.

427
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,316
I just don't want to be involved
in whatever it is you do.

428
00:30:15,425 --> 00:30:19,696
English, you know exactly
what it is that we do.

429
00:30:19,729 --> 00:30:22,832
No, sir, I-I actually
don't know anything.

430
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:24,701
I don't know what that is.

431
00:30:24,734 --> 00:30:27,704
I don't know why all these
gentlemen are looking for it.

432
00:30:27,737 --> 00:30:29,372
And if they come here,
I won't be able

433
00:30:29,405 --> 00:30:31,741
to placate their suspicions.

434
00:30:31,774 --> 00:30:35,445
I'm useless to you.
I'm a liability.

435
00:30:35,478 --> 00:30:39,282
I... I only just want
to be left alone.

436
00:30:46,723 --> 00:30:49,692
But you're not alone, English.

437
00:30:49,726 --> 00:30:53,396
Like it or not,
now you're part of the family.

438
00:30:55,498 --> 00:30:57,800
This is a tape from a bug.

439
00:30:57,834 --> 00:30:59,469
Oh, please, stop.

440
00:30:59,502 --> 00:31:01,604
Some new gizmo
the Feds came up with.

441
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:05,742
Records sound, like a Victrola.

442
00:31:05,775 --> 00:31:09,412
But you can hide it, 'cause
it's only the size of a...

443
00:31:09,445 --> 00:31:11,048
Oh, you get it.

444
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:16,352
The Hoover boys planted
their bug in one of our spots.

445
00:31:16,385 --> 00:31:17,653
But what they don't know

446
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:19,822
is that we have friends
in high places.

447
00:31:19,856 --> 00:31:24,427
Friends who could do things like
smuggle us a copy of the tape.

448
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,329
But before I could listen to it,

449
00:31:26,362 --> 00:31:27,898
La Fontaine's crew
rolls up on us.

450
00:31:27,931 --> 00:31:30,633
See, we're making moves on them,
and if they get the tape,

451
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:32,069
then they'll know
how to hit back.

452
00:31:32,102 --> 00:31:33,503
Everybody wants this thing.

453
00:31:33,536 --> 00:31:36,405
So throw it away.

454
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:38,608
Somebody's been ratting us out
to La Fontaine.

455
00:31:38,641 --> 00:31:40,810
Now, somebody...

456
00:31:40,843 --> 00:31:44,347
helped the Feds get a bug on us.

457
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,782
If we can listen to this thing,

458
00:31:45,815 --> 00:31:48,451
then we'll know
where it was planted. Boom.

459
00:31:48,484 --> 00:31:51,889
If I can find a machine
to play this tape tonight,

460
00:31:51,922 --> 00:31:54,791
the rat don't wake up tomorrow.

461
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:58,795
Your friend, Mr. Boyle,
will be here in three hours.

462
00:31:58,828 --> 00:32:00,797
Nobody but me or the big man
touches this.

463
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,799
- What if the police come?
- Get rid of 'em.

464
00:32:02,832 --> 00:32:04,101
What if these
other gentlemen come?

465
00:32:04,134 --> 00:32:05,368
Get rid of 'em!

466
00:32:06,836 --> 00:32:08,538
'Cause if I get back

467
00:32:08,571 --> 00:32:11,340
and that tape isn't
sitting right there...

468
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,646
Welcome to the family.

469
00:33:20,043 --> 00:33:21,912
Master Richie.

470
00:33:22,913 --> 00:33:24,480
How are you feeling?

471
00:33:24,513 --> 00:33:26,649
Fuck you.
How you think I'm feeling?

472
00:33:26,682 --> 00:33:28,484
Unwell.

473
00:33:32,655 --> 00:33:34,657
Listen, uh...

474
00:33:36,626 --> 00:33:38,929
English, I want to thank you.

475
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,832
You saved my life, so...

476
00:33:42,865 --> 00:33:44,567
I don't know that I did, sir.

477
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,535
No, no, no.

478
00:33:46,569 --> 00:33:48,604
Came to you in a bad moment.

479
00:33:50,007 --> 00:33:52,675
You were a stand-up guy.

480
00:33:54,011 --> 00:33:55,711
Water?

481
00:33:55,745 --> 00:33:57,813
Sure.

482
00:33:57,847 --> 00:33:59,415
Yeah.

483
00:34:12,561 --> 00:34:15,232
Where's Francis?

484
00:34:15,265 --> 00:34:17,533
He, he said he had to find a way

485
00:34:17,566 --> 00:34:19,435
to play your tape.

486
00:34:21,071 --> 00:34:23,240
What do you mean, he left?

487
00:34:23,273 --> 00:34:27,244
Uh, something about how playing
the tape would tell him, uh,

488
00:34:27,277 --> 00:34:28,744
who the rat is.

489
00:34:28,778 --> 00:34:31,915
That's what you call it,
isn't it?

490
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:33,549
- A rat?
- Hmm.

491
00:34:33,582 --> 00:34:35,851
Francis told you that?

492
00:34:36,852 --> 00:34:38,554
Mm.

493
00:34:38,587 --> 00:34:41,691
He's just not usually
the type to get blabby.

494
00:34:41,724 --> 00:34:43,826
Well, it sounds like
it's been a long night.

495
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:46,462
- For us all.
- Yeah.

496
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:50,766
S-Slowly with that.

497
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,702
I got it.

498
00:34:53,502 --> 00:34:55,871
Who would do such a thing
to your family?

499
00:34:56,839 --> 00:35:01,078
After everything your father's
done for this neighborhood.

500
00:35:01,878 --> 00:35:04,847
My pops is
this fucking neighborhood.

501
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:06,482
Indeed.

502
00:35:15,691 --> 00:35:18,895
When I first came to Chicago,

503
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:22,299
all I had to me name
was a set of shears.

504
00:35:22,332 --> 00:35:25,735
Your father, did you know
he was my very first customer?

505
00:35:25,768 --> 00:35:27,104
Very first.

506
00:35:28,338 --> 00:35:29,805
Yeah, I remember that.

507
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,075
- Do you?
- Yeah.

508
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:33,709
Pops was excited.

509
00:35:33,743 --> 00:35:35,845
He, uh...

510
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:37,813
came home one day
saying, you know,

511
00:35:37,847 --> 00:35:39,316
"There's a new tailor in town."

512
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:40,984
- Did he?
- Yeah, "Right from England."

513
00:35:42,651 --> 00:35:44,553
It was a very warm welcome,
I tell you.

514
00:35:44,587 --> 00:35:45,721
Yeah.

515
00:35:45,755 --> 00:35:47,757
Much appreciated.

516
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,825
Pops loves all that
fancy stuff, you know.

517
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:52,595
- He does. He's got good taste.
- Mm-hmm.

518
00:35:53,363 --> 00:35:56,599
You know that he...
he taught me how to tie a tie

519
00:35:56,632 --> 00:35:58,068
for the first time
when I was four.

520
00:35:58,101 --> 00:35:59,635
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

521
00:35:59,668 --> 00:36:00,770
Four?

522
00:36:00,803 --> 00:36:03,040
What was he always saying? Uh...

523
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:04,941
"A well-tied tie is the, uh,

524
00:36:04,975 --> 00:36:06,176
first serious step
in life, kid."

525
00:36:06,209 --> 00:36:07,911
Some shit like that.

526
00:36:07,944 --> 00:36:10,914
- Wilde.
- Mm, fucking crazy, right?

527
00:36:10,947 --> 00:36:12,883
No, that's a quote.

528
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:14,784
Oscar Wilde.

529
00:36:14,817 --> 00:36:16,987
Yeah, I don't know him.

530
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,189
But see, that's probably why
my pops likes you, though.

531
00:36:19,222 --> 00:36:22,858
You know, he's into all that
quoting fancy people shit.

532
00:36:29,632 --> 00:36:31,801
So, who do you think it is?

533
00:36:31,834 --> 00:36:33,070
Who do I think is who?

534
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:35,671
This Judas
who's betrayed your family.

535
00:36:35,704 --> 00:36:37,640
I don't know.

536
00:36:40,709 --> 00:36:45,015
I'll wager
a clever young man like yourself

537
00:36:45,048 --> 00:36:47,984
must have some suspicions.

538
00:36:48,018 --> 00:36:52,655
Someone close to the family,
perhaps, but, but not family.

539
00:36:59,662 --> 00:37:02,933
I have something I need
to tell you, Master Richie.

540
00:37:02,966 --> 00:37:04,733
Okay.

541
00:37:06,702 --> 00:37:08,205
I feel terrible.

542
00:37:09,872 --> 00:37:11,841
I-I never imagined

543
00:37:11,874 --> 00:37:14,710
things would get
so out of control.

544
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,119
That anyone would be harmed,
much less yourself,

545
00:37:22,152 --> 00:37:26,223
or... or, God forbid,
your father.

546
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:28,992
But...

547
00:37:29,025 --> 00:37:31,694
The fuck are you
talking about, English?

548
00:37:33,696 --> 00:37:36,765
I... I have to tell...

549
00:37:37,766 --> 00:37:39,169
I have to tell you...

550
00:37:39,202 --> 00:37:40,904
Spit it out.

551
00:37:48,145 --> 00:37:49,913
I'm the rat.

552
00:37:53,816 --> 00:37:57,820
I've been selling information
to your enemies.

553
00:37:59,923 --> 00:38:03,226
And I let the Federal Bureau
of Investigation

554
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:06,963
plant their bug... here.

555
00:38:22,913 --> 00:38:24,881
Holy shit, you had me.

556
00:38:24,915 --> 00:38:26,950
You fucking had me.

557
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:35,058
I almost fucking shot you.

558
00:38:35,091 --> 00:38:37,194
I felt it.

559
00:38:37,227 --> 00:38:39,196
I made you laugh.

560
00:38:39,229 --> 00:38:41,797
It's a hell of a thing
to joke about.

561
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,233
Well, it's the best medicine,
you know.

562
00:38:43,266 --> 00:38:44,234
It is.

563
00:38:44,267 --> 00:38:46,970
Can you imagine, huh?

564
00:38:47,003 --> 00:38:49,805
You... the rat?

565
00:38:51,774 --> 00:38:53,043
Wait a minute.

566
00:38:53,076 --> 00:38:54,211
What do you mean by that?

567
00:38:55,778 --> 00:38:57,813
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

568
00:38:57,846 --> 00:38:59,916
You couldn't be the rat.

569
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,285
I absolutely could be the rat.

570
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:04,354
- Not a chance.
- Why not?

571
00:39:04,387 --> 00:39:06,256
Why? 'Cause look at you.

572
00:39:06,289 --> 00:39:07,823
What about me?

573
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:10,859
Nah, uh-uh.

574
00:39:10,894 --> 00:39:12,996
You're just a fucking tailor.

575
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:18,134
I'm not a tailor.

576
00:39:18,168 --> 00:39:19,302
I'm a cutter.

577
00:39:19,336 --> 00:39:21,837
- Sorry.
- A tailor sews on buttons

578
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,839
and hems trousers.

579
00:39:23,872 --> 00:39:28,078
Anyone with a needle and thread
and 15 minutes can be a tailor.

580
00:39:28,111 --> 00:39:31,181
I studied for decades
to be a cutter.

581
00:39:31,214 --> 00:39:34,150
I used to cut on the Row.

582
00:39:34,184 --> 00:39:36,386
- Fuck is "the Row"?
- Savile Row.

583
00:39:36,419 --> 00:39:38,388
Where's that, North Addison?

584
00:39:38,421 --> 00:39:39,990
It's in London.

585
00:39:40,023 --> 00:39:42,292
A quarter of a mile in which

586
00:39:42,325 --> 00:39:45,828
the greatest craftsmen
in the world

587
00:39:45,861 --> 00:39:47,796
all ply their trade.

588
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:52,168
I apprenticed there for years
before they allowed me...

589
00:39:53,903 --> 00:39:55,771
...to open my own shop.

590
00:39:56,439 --> 00:40:00,010
- Why'd you come here, then?
- The war.

591
00:40:00,043 --> 00:40:01,311
What, Krauts bomb your place?

592
00:40:01,344 --> 00:40:04,014
Worse.
They're called blue jeans.

593
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:07,117
After the war,

594
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,919
things were quite poor
in England.

595
00:40:09,953 --> 00:40:13,023
Not a lot of men
could afford well-made things,

596
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:16,859
so these blue jeans
became all the rage.

597
00:40:16,893 --> 00:40:19,129
Well, times change, pal.

598
00:40:19,162 --> 00:40:21,031
Blue jeans are the fashion now.

599
00:40:21,064 --> 00:40:24,200
This James Dean of yours
makes one picture

600
00:40:24,234 --> 00:40:25,902
and blue jeans are the fashion.

601
00:40:25,935 --> 00:40:27,404
Soon he'll make another,

602
00:40:27,437 --> 00:40:29,906
something else
will become popular.

603
00:40:29,939 --> 00:40:33,076
These fashionable things,
they don't last.

604
00:40:33,109 --> 00:40:35,178
The things I make,

605
00:40:35,211 --> 00:40:37,180
- like that suit of yours...
- Mm.

606
00:40:37,213 --> 00:40:38,415
...it's timeless.

607
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:42,352
So you thought that a bunch
of fancy-pants in England

608
00:40:42,385 --> 00:40:44,187
couldn't appreciate
the finer things,

609
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,357
so you came to Chicago?

610
00:40:48,658 --> 00:40:51,628
Wow. You must fucking
love Red Hots.

611
00:40:51,661 --> 00:40:56,299
I came to a place
that isn't weighed down...

612
00:40:59,235 --> 00:41:01,037
...with bitter history.

613
00:41:02,238 --> 00:41:03,473
And, yes,

614
00:41:03,506 --> 00:41:05,975
Red Hots are delicious.

615
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,998
I do hope
your cousin's all right.

616
00:41:29,032 --> 00:41:30,934
My cousin?

617
00:41:35,705 --> 00:41:38,141
- How is he?
- Awake.

618
00:41:38,174 --> 00:41:40,210
But...

619
00:41:40,243 --> 00:41:42,278
Francis ain't my goddamn cousin.

620
00:41:42,312 --> 00:41:44,381
He's not?

621
00:41:44,414 --> 00:41:45,915
But what?

622
00:41:45,949 --> 00:41:47,183
What's the matter with him?

623
00:41:47,217 --> 00:41:49,252
Come on, spit it out.

624
00:41:49,285 --> 00:41:52,088
My pops can see the
mangiest mutt on the street,

625
00:41:52,122 --> 00:41:54,391
and if he's got teeth
sharp enough,

626
00:41:54,424 --> 00:41:57,093
he'll be eating with us
at the dinner table.

627
00:41:57,127 --> 00:41:59,329
He's lost a lot of blood.

628
00:41:59,362 --> 00:42:02,165
He's probably light in the head.

629
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:13,176
Where did Francis say
he was going exactly?

630
00:42:13,209 --> 00:42:18,014
Oh, no, you can't think
he has anything to do with this.

631
00:42:18,047 --> 00:42:20,183
It's not my place to speak ill
of Master Richie,

632
00:42:20,216 --> 00:42:24,554
but he keeps going on about
this rat you mentioned.

633
00:42:24,587 --> 00:42:26,322
What about the rat?

634
00:42:26,356 --> 00:42:29,526
He said before, he was the one
looking for the rat.

635
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:34,431
Why would he place himself
in charge of looking for the rat

636
00:42:34,464 --> 00:42:37,233
if he was the rat himself?

637
00:42:37,267 --> 00:42:38,735
So he told you all that,

638
00:42:38,768 --> 00:42:41,037
but he didn't tell you
where he was going?

639
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:43,740
"I know who the rat is,"
he says.

640
00:42:43,773 --> 00:42:46,176
"Francis thinks
he can pull one over on me."

641
00:42:46,209 --> 00:42:48,244
- Who, me?
- Well.

642
00:42:48,278 --> 00:42:51,214
He keeps fiddling
with your briefcase.

643
00:42:53,149 --> 00:42:55,452
- What did he do to the case?
- Nothing.

644
00:42:55,485 --> 00:42:57,520
He left the case in there.

645
00:42:57,554 --> 00:42:59,088
If I was the rat...

646
00:42:59,956 --> 00:43:03,059
...and try as I might,
I can't seem to convince you

647
00:43:03,092 --> 00:43:05,195
that I am...

648
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:10,099
...well, I'd want to burn
that thing straightaway.

649
00:43:10,133 --> 00:43:15,238
So, you see, you've nothing to
fear from your friend Francis.

650
00:43:16,439 --> 00:43:18,374
He's family.

651
00:43:19,542 --> 00:43:21,377
Well, almost.

652
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,416
I haven't left him.

653
00:43:26,449 --> 00:43:28,017
Till now.

654
00:43:30,653 --> 00:43:33,456
English, get the door.

655
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,374
Richie.

656
00:43:51,407 --> 00:43:53,409
How you feeling?

657
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,379
Oh, I'm just peachy, yeah.

658
00:43:56,412 --> 00:43:57,647
How you feeling?

659
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,415
I didn't get shot
in the stomach earlier,

660
00:43:59,449 --> 00:44:00,517
so, you know, not bad.

661
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:02,318
Lucky, isn't it?

662
00:44:02,352 --> 00:44:04,587
All those bullets flying around,
but the La Fontaines,

663
00:44:04,621 --> 00:44:07,123
they didn't land
a single one on you, hmm?

664
00:44:07,156 --> 00:44:09,092
Not luck, Richie. It's, um...

665
00:44:10,093 --> 00:44:11,394
...it's skill.

666
00:44:11,427 --> 00:44:13,463
I guess I was too slow.

667
00:44:13,496 --> 00:44:16,332
So where you been?

668
00:44:16,366 --> 00:44:18,201
Made some calls.

669
00:44:18,234 --> 00:44:20,670
I checked in with a hi-fi shop,
owes us a favor.

670
00:44:20,703 --> 00:44:22,539
They got a machine
that can play the tape.

671
00:44:22,572 --> 00:44:25,241
I'm, I'm gonna go over
with it this minute.

672
00:44:25,275 --> 00:44:27,143
So you want to take the tape?

673
00:44:27,176 --> 00:44:29,212
Yeah. Pronto.

674
00:44:30,213 --> 00:44:32,549
- Why don't I go with you.
- No, no.

675
00:44:32,582 --> 00:44:34,651
You're in no shape
to be out there.

676
00:44:34,684 --> 00:44:37,387
So you want to walk out of here
with this tape alone?

677
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,256
- Is that right?
- That's right.

678
00:44:41,457 --> 00:44:43,059
I'll tell you what.

679
00:44:43,726 --> 00:44:45,662
Just wait for my pops
to get here, you know?

680
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,664
Then we can all listen
to the tape together.

681
00:44:47,697 --> 00:44:49,866
We don't have time.

682
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,535
- What's the big rush?
- Every second the rat is alive

683
00:44:52,569 --> 00:44:55,305
is another second
that your father is in danger.

684
00:44:55,338 --> 00:44:57,373
Gentlemen.

685
00:44:59,442 --> 00:45:02,178
If I know your father,
Master Richie,

686
00:45:02,211 --> 00:45:06,349
your father would want you both
to take a deep breath.

687
00:45:07,918 --> 00:45:10,687
Now... glad you said that.

688
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,488
Hmm?

689
00:45:12,522 --> 00:45:14,524
My father.

690
00:45:16,526 --> 00:45:18,561
My father, Francis.

691
00:45:20,229 --> 00:45:23,132
It's my father
who's in danger, not yours.

692
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:24,634
I love your father
like he was my own

693
00:45:24,667 --> 00:45:26,469
and I'm trying to help him.

694
00:45:26,502 --> 00:45:29,672
See, wasn't your father

695
00:45:29,706 --> 00:45:32,375
selling fucking tomatoes
down on State Street

696
00:45:32,408 --> 00:45:37,146
before he died from a lifetime
of being nothing to nobody?

697
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,615
Huh?

698
00:45:38,648 --> 00:45:42,185
So maybe me and my pops
don't need your fucking help.

699
00:45:42,218 --> 00:45:43,519
You ever think of that?

700
00:45:49,392 --> 00:45:51,427
I'm gonna need that tape, pal,
right now.

701
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:56,766
Why don't you try and take it.

702
00:45:56,799 --> 00:45:58,434
Not tonight.
Now give me the tape.

703
00:45:58,468 --> 00:46:00,436
Really, Francis,
I mean, what's the, uh,

704
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:01,939
what's the rush?

705
00:46:01,972 --> 00:46:05,608
I mean, really, my pops
will be here any minute.

706
00:46:06,409 --> 00:46:10,246
Unless you don't want my pops
listening to this tape.

707
00:46:10,279 --> 00:46:12,248
What are you talking about?

708
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:15,385
Huh?

709
00:46:15,418 --> 00:46:18,421
Why don't you want my pops
listening to this tape, Francis?

710
00:46:19,422 --> 00:46:21,424
I said, give me
the fucking tape.

711
00:46:22,425 --> 00:46:23,559
Ooh.

712
00:46:24,827 --> 00:46:27,363
Now who's too fucking slow?

713
00:46:29,832 --> 00:46:32,301
- Richie.
- Mm?

714
00:46:32,335 --> 00:46:35,805
Richie, for your own good,
for the good of your father,

715
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:40,410
I'm gonna take that tape now
and I'm gonna leave.

716
00:46:40,443 --> 00:46:42,478
If you touch me again...

717
00:46:44,681 --> 00:46:47,583
...I'll break your fucking arm,
you understand?

718
00:46:51,587 --> 00:46:54,624
You're such a fucking prick,
you know that?

719
00:46:55,858 --> 00:46:57,560
Think you're so fucking smart.

720
00:46:57,593 --> 00:46:59,362
- Careful.
- Hmm?

721
00:46:59,395 --> 00:47:01,364
- Smarter than everyone.
- Careful, Master Richie.

722
00:47:01,397 --> 00:47:02,732
- Careful.
- Eh?

723
00:47:04,834 --> 00:47:06,736
You fucking...

724
00:47:19,615 --> 00:47:21,718
Where's the tape, Francis?

725
00:47:21,751 --> 00:47:23,586
You must be out of your mind
to point that gun at me.

726
00:47:23,619 --> 00:47:26,322
- Gentlemen.
- Stop playing games, Richie.

727
00:47:26,355 --> 00:47:27,657
Where'd you put the tape?

728
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,625
- What was your plan?
- Did you hide it to try

729
00:47:29,659 --> 00:47:30,860
and trick me
into confessing something?

730
00:47:30,894 --> 00:47:32,428
'Cause that is somehow

731
00:47:32,462 --> 00:47:34,031
the dumbest thing
you've done all day.

732
00:47:34,064 --> 00:47:36,332
Mm. Always wanted to be
the big man, didn't you?

733
00:47:36,365 --> 00:47:39,402
No selling tomatoes for you.
No, no, no.

734
00:47:39,435 --> 00:47:40,636
You don't want to work
for my pops.

735
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:41,804
You want to fucking be him.

736
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:43,506
I owe everything to that man.

737
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:44,741
Well, guess what.

738
00:47:44,774 --> 00:47:46,275
As long as me and him
are around,

739
00:47:46,309 --> 00:47:47,477
you ain't never gonna be
number one.

740
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:49,812
There's no need
for this fighting.

741
00:47:49,846 --> 00:47:51,514
You slimy fuck,
I had you pegged from day one.

742
00:47:51,547 --> 00:47:53,382
You know that?

743
00:47:53,416 --> 00:47:57,620
From the second I first
laid eyes on you, I said,

744
00:47:57,653 --> 00:48:02,059
"Who the fuck
is this son of a bitch?"

745
00:48:02,092 --> 00:48:03,793
He ain't family.

746
00:48:03,826 --> 00:48:05,661
No, I'm the guy
who took six marbles

747
00:48:05,695 --> 00:48:08,798
to save your father's life
because family wasn't there.

748
00:48:08,831 --> 00:48:10,600
Yeah, fuck you!

749
00:48:10,633 --> 00:48:13,369
- I run this crew.
- No, your pops runs this crew.

750
00:48:13,402 --> 00:48:16,073
And I spend half of every day
cleaning up your messes.

751
00:48:17,673 --> 00:48:19,675
You want to see me make a mess?

752
00:48:48,805 --> 00:48:50,941
Damn it, Richie.
Why'd you make me do that?

753
00:49:01,151 --> 00:49:03,753
These are the last words
you're gonna hear,

754
00:49:03,786 --> 00:49:06,689
so I hope you remember them
in hell.

755
00:49:08,591 --> 00:49:10,526
You didn't die
because you're dumb,

756
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,329
because you're arrogant
or because you're slow.

757
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,734
It was because you're weak.

758
00:49:42,758 --> 00:49:44,393
You killed him.

759
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:50,366
You really pay attention,
don't you?

760
00:49:55,504 --> 00:49:58,741
- Where did Richie put the tape?
- I've no idea.

761
00:50:00,843 --> 00:50:03,914
Maybe you could explain
what happened.

762
00:50:03,947 --> 00:50:06,415
To God Almighty?

763
00:50:06,449 --> 00:50:07,817
No, to Mr. Boyle.

764
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:09,652
There's a difference?

765
00:50:10,786 --> 00:50:12,755
He had to hide it
in here somewhere.

766
00:50:16,026 --> 00:50:18,461
You brought a man
in here injured.

767
00:50:18,494 --> 00:50:20,796
Perhaps he didn't survive
his wounds.

768
00:50:21,731 --> 00:50:23,901
He's missing
half his goddamned head.

769
00:50:23,934 --> 00:50:27,570
On the phone,
I told his father he'd be fine.

770
00:50:27,603 --> 00:50:29,940
When a mistake has been made...

771
00:50:30,873 --> 00:50:35,478
...I've always found it best
to simply be up-front about it.

772
00:50:35,511 --> 00:50:38,481
English, I didn't cut
the boss's pants too short.

773
00:50:38,514 --> 00:50:39,815
I shot his son in the face.

774
00:50:41,919 --> 00:50:43,819
Shit.

775
00:50:43,853 --> 00:50:45,788
That's the man's Caddy.

776
00:50:45,821 --> 00:50:47,891
- Let's explain...
- Open the trunk.

777
00:50:47,925 --> 00:50:49,993
- What?
- Open the trunk and-and grab his arms.

778
00:50:50,027 --> 00:50:51,929
What you gonna do with him?

779
00:50:51,962 --> 00:50:54,630
Grab his goddamned arms
or else I'm hiding two bodies.

780
00:50:59,002 --> 00:51:00,670
Go. Get the door.

781
00:51:00,703 --> 00:51:02,605
Take your sweet time
bringing him back here.

782
00:51:02,638 --> 00:51:04,507
I need to clean this up.

783
00:51:10,713 --> 00:51:13,250
I don't know anything
about lying.

784
00:51:13,283 --> 00:51:14,684
Subterfuge.

785
00:51:14,717 --> 00:51:15,919
You don't know
how to say one thing

786
00:51:15,953 --> 00:51:18,255
when you mean something else?

787
00:51:18,288 --> 00:51:19,923
I thought you were English.

788
00:51:51,021 --> 00:51:53,856
Well, aren't you
a sight for sore eyes.

789
00:51:57,894 --> 00:51:59,595
- You're in one piece?
- Mm.

790
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:06,103
I'm not gonna forget
what you're doing for my crew,

791
00:52:06,136 --> 00:52:07,938
my family, tonight.

792
00:52:07,971 --> 00:52:09,772
I'm at your service, sir.

793
00:52:13,843 --> 00:52:15,012
Where are the boys?

794
00:52:15,045 --> 00:52:17,680
Are we quite
all in one piece, sir?

795
00:52:19,682 --> 00:52:21,084
Oh, it's not mine.

796
00:52:21,885 --> 00:52:24,787
We had to make
a few stops on the way.

797
00:52:26,056 --> 00:52:28,125
Where are the boys?

798
00:52:39,202 --> 00:52:41,104
Boss.

799
00:52:41,138 --> 00:52:42,738
You all right?

800
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:46,176
You must have made it
through some hell.

801
00:52:46,209 --> 00:52:48,611
Hey, nothing I haven't
seen before.

802
00:52:48,644 --> 00:52:52,049
First you save my life
and then you save my son's.

803
00:52:52,082 --> 00:52:55,018
One of these days, I'll have
to find a way to repay you.

804
00:52:55,052 --> 00:52:57,620
Hey, y-you been
to see La Fontaine?

805
00:52:57,653 --> 00:52:58,788
Got a few hard boys
still out there

806
00:52:58,821 --> 00:53:00,057
leaving calling cards.

807
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:01,657
Ah, the numbers game
at the Green Dragon?

808
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:02,926
There ain't no more numbers game

809
00:53:02,959 --> 00:53:04,094
at the Green Dragon.

810
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:06,930
Now it's a nice warm bonfire.

811
00:53:06,963 --> 00:53:08,631
Couple of Chicago's bravest

812
00:53:08,664 --> 00:53:10,167
running around
with squirt pistols.

813
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,702
- Glad you're keeping them busy.
- Where's Richie?

814
00:53:13,736 --> 00:53:15,838
Oh, I... I thought
he was with you.

815
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:18,774
- Why would he be with me?
- Well, he...

816
00:53:18,808 --> 00:53:20,743
he-he went out to find you.

817
00:53:20,776 --> 00:53:22,079
Find me? Why?

818
00:53:23,246 --> 00:53:25,148
Hey, you know how Richie is.

819
00:53:25,182 --> 00:53:27,084
You let my son walk out of here
with a marble in his gut?

820
00:53:27,117 --> 00:53:29,019
Let him?

821
00:53:29,052 --> 00:53:31,188
You know, Richie does
what Richie does, right?

822
00:53:31,221 --> 00:53:32,956
That's why you're there
to protect him.

823
00:53:32,989 --> 00:53:36,193
Well, he was doing okay.
E-English here patched him up.

824
00:53:38,694 --> 00:53:40,163
Tell the boss what you did.

825
00:53:42,865 --> 00:53:45,135
I did, I did what I could.

826
00:53:45,168 --> 00:53:47,837
And then Richie just
strolled out of here?

827
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:50,407
Well, you... yeah,
he walked on two feet

828
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,708
and, uh, yeah, he left.

829
00:53:52,741 --> 00:53:54,878
Okay. Grab the tape
and let's go find him.

830
00:53:54,911 --> 00:53:56,213
Richie took it with.

831
00:53:58,915 --> 00:54:00,984
I'm sorry,
I think I misheard you.

832
00:54:01,017 --> 00:54:03,719
Well, he said he was gonna
bring you the tape.

833
00:54:03,752 --> 00:54:05,688
He told me to stay here.

834
00:54:05,721 --> 00:54:07,991
You didn't think maybe
you should've gone with him?

835
00:54:08,024 --> 00:54:09,226
It's Richie, boss.

836
00:54:09,259 --> 00:54:10,860
He...

837
00:54:10,894 --> 00:54:12,996
Right? The man has
something to prove,

838
00:54:13,029 --> 00:54:15,432
and I figured the best thing
in this situation

839
00:54:15,465 --> 00:54:18,902
was to stay right here
in, uh, in case you turned up.

840
00:54:18,935 --> 00:54:21,004
You figured wrong.

841
00:54:21,037 --> 00:54:23,639
Where exactly did he go?

842
00:54:24,307 --> 00:54:26,910
Well, he didn't give me
an itinerary.

843
00:54:38,255 --> 00:54:39,688
Phone?

844
00:55:03,346 --> 00:55:05,814
It's Roy. Is Richie there?

845
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:09,186
Well, then go check. Now.

846
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:18,228
You're positive?
He hasn't been there all night?

847
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:27,836
Well, check with our
North Side friends. I'll wait.

848
00:55:31,874 --> 00:55:33,009
Damn it.

849
00:55:35,946 --> 00:55:37,813
All right. I'm at the tailor's.

850
00:55:37,846 --> 00:55:42,252
I want you to call me back here
every 15 minutes with an update.

851
00:55:42,285 --> 00:55:44,521
You understand?

852
00:55:44,554 --> 00:55:46,122
Every quarter hour.

853
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:50,260
Uh-huh.

854
00:55:53,363 --> 00:55:55,165
Uh-huh.

855
00:56:12,382 --> 00:56:14,117
Everything good, boss?

856
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:16,852
Not a single thing is good.

857
00:56:16,886 --> 00:56:19,089
My boy is missing,
the tape is missing,

858
00:56:19,122 --> 00:56:21,124
and there are more blue boys
on those streets

859
00:56:21,157 --> 00:56:23,859
than at
the St. Paddy's Day Parade.

860
00:56:25,328 --> 00:56:27,297
- Let's go find him, like you said.
- Where?

861
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:29,232
Everywhere.

862
00:56:29,266 --> 00:56:31,268
Hey, I don't like him being
out there any more than you do.

863
00:56:31,301 --> 00:56:34,170
And, uh, English here's
done enough.

864
00:56:34,204 --> 00:56:36,839
We should, uh...
we should let him head home.

865
00:56:41,278 --> 00:56:42,912
Yeah, all right.

866
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,382
But just you.

867
00:56:46,182 --> 00:56:48,885
If Richie shows up
at any of our spots,

868
00:56:48,918 --> 00:56:51,288
they'll call here,
so I'm staying here.

869
00:56:52,389 --> 00:56:53,856
Boss, if I go alone, um...

870
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:55,824
You got a problem, Francis?

871
00:56:55,858 --> 00:56:57,826
No. No problem.

872
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:01,364
You stay here and I'll...
I'll go find Richie.

873
00:57:04,267 --> 00:57:06,069
Francis.

874
00:57:08,371 --> 00:57:10,940
Bring my boy back to me.

875
00:57:21,451 --> 00:57:24,054
It's gonna be a long night.

876
00:57:25,055 --> 00:57:27,357
They usually are, sir.

877
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:30,927
<i>Some years ago,</i>

878
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,997
<i>a customer comes into my shop
with a suit,</i>

879
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:35,831
<i>not one of mine.</i>

880
00:57:37,967 --> 00:57:41,971
<i>The customer says,
"The jacket, it's too big."</i>

881
00:57:42,005 --> 00:57:43,406
<i>It is.</i>

882
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,076
<i>"The problem," I say,
"is the shoulders."</i>

883
00:57:46,109 --> 00:57:49,346
<i>But the customer says,
no, he likes the shoulders.</i>

884
00:57:49,379 --> 00:57:52,115
<i>The problem is the sleeves.</i>

885
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:55,251
<i>We go back and forth.</i>

886
00:57:55,285 --> 00:57:57,887
<i>Finally, the customer says,
"It's my money,</i>

887
00:57:57,921 --> 00:58:00,957
<i>and I'm telling you,
cut the sleeves."</i>

888
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:02,892
<i>So what do I do?</i>

889
00:58:03,693 --> 00:58:07,897
<i>I say, "Yes, sir,"
and then I cut the shoulders.</i>

890
00:58:07,931 --> 00:58:10,400
<i>The customer, he comes back,
tries on his suit.</i>

891
00:58:10,433 --> 00:58:12,135
<i>"It's perfect," he says.</i>

892
00:58:12,168 --> 00:58:15,372
<i>"That's exactly
what I asked for."</i>

893
00:58:24,714 --> 00:58:27,984
You learn how to do all this
on the Row?

894
00:58:28,985 --> 00:58:30,186
Yes, sir.

895
00:58:53,443 --> 00:58:55,912
You get these on the Row, too?

896
00:59:03,353 --> 00:59:05,155
My apologies.

897
00:59:07,023 --> 00:59:11,294
I trained on these shears.

898
00:59:11,327 --> 00:59:15,932
Every cut I've made,
I made with these shears.

899
00:59:16,966 --> 00:59:21,137
They're all I brought with me
when I came to Chicago.

900
00:59:23,473 --> 00:59:24,441
- Please.
- No, no, no, no.

901
00:59:24,474 --> 00:59:27,010
Oh, no, please. Please.

902
00:59:39,122 --> 00:59:42,058
You never told me
why you left England.

903
00:59:42,091 --> 00:59:43,760
It was under attack.

904
00:59:43,793 --> 00:59:45,428
Ah, Nazis?

905
00:59:45,462 --> 00:59:47,063
Worse.

906
00:59:47,096 --> 00:59:48,765
They're called blue jeans.

907
00:59:54,537 --> 00:59:56,239
I know what it's like

908
00:59:56,272 --> 00:59:58,475
to try to make something
of yourself.

909
00:59:58,508 --> 01:00:00,276
Yes.

910
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:02,345
Just you and your trusted tools.

911
01:00:03,613 --> 01:00:05,415
For example...

912
01:00:10,653 --> 01:00:13,389
I use this thing here to kill.

913
01:00:15,124 --> 01:00:16,626
I don't even know
how many people.

914
01:00:16,659 --> 01:00:19,162
All right.

915
01:00:19,195 --> 01:00:22,365
You got your tools, I got mine.
Here.

916
01:00:22,398 --> 01:00:24,200
Take a look.

917
01:00:27,237 --> 01:00:29,506
I read something once

918
01:00:29,539 --> 01:00:32,375
about how the thing
that separates

919
01:00:32,408 --> 01:00:34,377
man from monkeys is tools.

920
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:36,179
Do you believe all that?

921
01:00:36,212 --> 01:00:38,014
Evolution?

922
01:00:38,615 --> 01:00:40,517
I don't know.

923
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:44,120
But I do know that a man
has a choice in this world

924
01:00:44,153 --> 01:00:46,089
about how he uses his tools.

925
01:00:47,123 --> 01:00:49,259
He can destroy or he can build.

926
01:00:49,292 --> 01:00:50,527
And you think I destroy.

927
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:53,830
But, no, with this,
I've built loyalty.

928
01:00:53,863 --> 01:00:57,333
I have built a crew.
I've built a neighborhood.

929
01:00:59,302 --> 01:01:01,604
And the men I've had to kill...

930
01:01:03,439 --> 01:01:06,276
...well, you have to toss away
a few scraps, don't you,

931
01:01:06,309 --> 01:01:08,778
when you're cutting
a pair of pants?

932
01:01:12,682 --> 01:01:16,052
Have you ever heard of
the Outfit?

933
01:01:17,287 --> 01:01:20,156
Well, I make clothes, so...

934
01:01:20,189 --> 01:01:21,691
Oh, n-not that kind of outfit.

935
01:01:21,724 --> 01:01:23,626
It's an organization.

936
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:26,262
What, like the Rotary Club?

937
01:01:27,564 --> 01:01:29,365
Maybe you've heard of Al Capone?

938
01:01:29,399 --> 01:01:30,600
Him I've heard of.

939
01:01:30,633 --> 01:01:32,302
Yeah. He started it.

940
01:01:32,335 --> 01:01:35,305
- The Rotary Club?
- The Outfit.

941
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:37,674
Al Capone's dead, isn't he?

942
01:01:37,707 --> 01:01:39,609
After he died,

943
01:01:39,642 --> 01:01:43,613
his organization spread out,
became more of a network.

944
01:01:45,214 --> 01:01:50,320
Every big-time crew from
Santa Monica to Coney Island,

945
01:01:50,353 --> 01:01:53,389
Italians in the East,
Jews in the West,

946
01:01:53,423 --> 01:01:56,459
Poles in St. Louis...

947
01:01:56,492 --> 01:02:00,530
even a few sons of Killarney
here and there.

948
01:02:00,563 --> 01:02:03,132
The underworld United Nations.

949
01:02:03,166 --> 01:02:06,669
Anybody messes with anybody,
the Outfit has your back.

950
01:02:06,703 --> 01:02:08,471
It's like a stamp.

951
01:02:08,504 --> 01:02:11,207
- "You have arrived."
- And have you arrived?

952
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,475
Almost.

953
01:02:12,508 --> 01:02:14,477
They've been
sending us messages,

954
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:17,347
saying they like our style.

955
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,616
They're considering us,

956
01:02:19,649 --> 01:02:21,551
if we can finish
what we started.

957
01:02:21,584 --> 01:02:23,686
And what have you started?

958
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:26,356
Putting every one of
the La Fontaines in the dirt.

959
01:02:26,389 --> 01:02:29,225
See, the La Fontaines
aren't builders.

960
01:02:29,258 --> 01:02:30,928
That family has been running

961
01:02:30,961 --> 01:02:33,129
the same numbers racket
for decades.

962
01:02:33,796 --> 01:02:36,232
Their neighborhood, their rules.

963
01:02:36,265 --> 01:02:39,469
Nobody ever had the balls
to move in on their operation.

964
01:02:39,502 --> 01:02:40,637
Until me.

965
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:44,674
This tape
everyone's looking for,

966
01:02:44,707 --> 01:02:49,579
Francis said that
some powerful friends

967
01:02:49,612 --> 01:02:51,614
got you a copy.

968
01:02:51,648 --> 01:02:53,549
The Outfit, they those friends?

969
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:55,418
Yeah, so you understand.

970
01:02:55,451 --> 01:02:59,656
That tape gets into
the wrong hands,

971
01:02:59,689 --> 01:03:02,659
then the entire thing
comes crashing down.

972
01:03:02,692 --> 01:03:05,395
Mr. Boyle, why are you
telling me all this?

973
01:03:05,428 --> 01:03:07,230
Because that's Richie's coat.

974
01:03:12,301 --> 01:03:13,302
Is it?

975
01:03:13,336 --> 01:03:15,371
- It is.
- Oh.

976
01:03:17,573 --> 01:03:20,978
Well, I suppose he must have
left without it.

977
01:03:21,011 --> 01:03:22,545
In December?

978
01:03:22,578 --> 01:03:24,380
He was in a bit of a hurry.

979
01:03:24,414 --> 01:03:27,650
December in Chicago,
and he went out without a coat?

980
01:03:29,385 --> 01:03:31,421
You're hiding something,
my friend.

981
01:03:32,722 --> 01:03:35,558
And I'm trying
to help you understand

982
01:03:35,591 --> 01:03:39,262
that even if I never find out
what it is, the Outfit will.

983
01:03:39,295 --> 01:03:41,497
So you want
to get clear of this,

984
01:03:41,531 --> 01:03:44,667
you need to tell me what really
happened in here tonight.

985
01:03:46,803 --> 01:03:48,371
Now.

986
01:03:48,404 --> 01:03:51,641
Mr. Boyle,
I'm telling you the truth.

987
01:03:57,647 --> 01:03:59,215
Monk!

988
01:04:01,617 --> 01:04:03,352
Who walks out into the cold,

989
01:04:03,386 --> 01:04:06,756
in December, in Chicago,
without his coat?

990
01:04:06,789 --> 01:04:08,491
I ain't good at riddles.

991
01:04:09,525 --> 01:04:12,361
English, where's my goddamn son?

992
01:04:13,362 --> 01:04:16,332
You got five seconds...

993
01:04:16,365 --> 01:04:17,667
to tell me what happened.

994
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:20,336
Five, four...

995
01:04:21,671 --> 01:04:23,806
- ...three...
- He made me promise not to tell.

996
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,808
Who? Who made you promise?

997
01:04:25,842 --> 01:04:29,512
He said he'd kill me
if I told you.

998
01:04:29,545 --> 01:04:30,646
Who?

999
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,648
Francis.

1000
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:38,621
Mr. Boyle,
what really happened to Richie

1001
01:04:38,654 --> 01:04:40,456
is that Francis shot...

1002
01:04:44,393 --> 01:04:45,561
Whoa.

1003
01:04:51,434 --> 01:04:52,668
Full house tonight, huh?

1004
01:04:52,702 --> 01:04:54,270
Mable.

1005
01:04:54,905 --> 01:04:58,274
We got some questions
about Richie?

1006
01:04:58,909 --> 01:05:01,078
Realized I know somebody
who might have some answers.

1007
01:05:01,111 --> 01:05:02,678
Francis, English was
just about to tell me

1008
01:05:02,712 --> 01:05:04,680
what really happened to Richie.

1009
01:05:05,715 --> 01:05:08,085
English said you shot somebody.

1010
01:05:08,118 --> 01:05:09,852
Oh, yeah?

1011
01:05:11,687 --> 01:05:13,523
Hey, don't look at her,

1012
01:05:13,556 --> 01:05:15,792
don't look at him,
you look at me.

1013
01:05:15,825 --> 01:05:17,527
If you tell me the truth,

1014
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,363
there isn't a gun in this town
can hurt you.

1015
01:05:20,396 --> 01:05:23,633
You are protected from him,
you're protected from him.

1016
01:05:23,666 --> 01:05:25,701
You will be warmed
from the elements.

1017
01:05:26,702 --> 01:05:28,638
But you gotta tell me the truth.

1018
01:05:29,639 --> 01:05:31,574
What did Francis do?

1019
01:05:32,943 --> 01:05:34,777
Francis shot...

1020
01:05:40,416 --> 01:05:41,684
Francis shot...

1021
01:05:43,486 --> 01:05:46,689
...four of La Fontaine's men

1022
01:05:46,722 --> 01:05:48,858
earlier this evening.

1023
01:05:50,393 --> 01:05:54,463
But Richie,
he didn't shoot a single one.

1024
01:05:55,464 --> 01:05:58,668
He said he was embarrassed.

1025
01:05:58,701 --> 01:06:00,938
Ashamed.

1026
01:06:00,971 --> 01:06:04,540
He said he had to go and...

1027
01:06:04,574 --> 01:06:06,509
go and kill someone.

1028
01:06:06,542 --> 01:06:07,743
Kill who?

1029
01:06:07,777 --> 01:06:09,512
La Fontaine.

1030
01:06:09,545 --> 01:06:13,917
Richie made us promise
not to tell you.

1031
01:06:17,187 --> 01:06:20,456
He knew what he was doing
was dangerous.

1032
01:06:20,489 --> 01:06:23,860
I suppose he didn't want you
to stop him.

1033
01:06:23,894 --> 01:06:26,362
You made Richie a promise,
English.

1034
01:06:27,898 --> 01:06:29,832
- We both did.
- Yes, we did.

1035
01:06:29,866 --> 01:06:31,767
I'm sorry, Mr. Boyle.

1036
01:06:33,769 --> 01:06:34,938
So...

1037
01:06:36,806 --> 01:06:39,475
...where's Richie now?

1038
01:06:39,508 --> 01:06:41,577
- You're the receptionist?
- Yes.

1039
01:06:41,611 --> 01:06:46,415
After Richie left,
on the way to kill La Fontaine,

1040
01:06:46,449 --> 01:06:48,484
I think he stopped by her place.

1041
01:06:48,517 --> 01:06:49,819
No, he didn't.

1042
01:06:49,852 --> 01:06:51,989
Why would he stop by
the receptionist's place?

1043
01:06:52,022 --> 01:06:55,192
- Because she's Richie's girl.
- I'm not Richie's girl.

1044
01:06:55,225 --> 01:06:56,659
- The hell you're not.
- I'm not. - You're not?

1045
01:06:56,692 --> 01:06:58,661
- I'm not.
- Yeah, she is.

1046
01:06:59,662 --> 01:07:01,530
Richie likes to brag.

1047
01:07:02,531 --> 01:07:06,469
Mr. Boyle,
all I know about tonight

1048
01:07:06,502 --> 01:07:07,770
is that, at 2:00 in the morning,

1049
01:07:07,803 --> 01:07:09,940
this ham-handed jerk
knocks on my door,

1050
01:07:09,973 --> 01:07:12,808
tells me I gotta come with him,
and when I demur, he s...

1051
01:07:12,842 --> 01:07:14,810
When I come into her place,

1052
01:07:14,844 --> 01:07:16,579
there's a bloodstain
on the carpet.

1053
01:07:16,612 --> 01:07:18,581
What?

1054
01:07:18,614 --> 01:07:19,917
That's not true. That's a lie.

1055
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:21,952
Stop! Stop!

1056
01:07:25,255 --> 01:07:27,556
Come.

1057
01:07:30,526 --> 01:07:32,662
You live close?

1058
01:07:34,563 --> 01:07:35,865
Down the street.

1059
01:07:35,899 --> 01:07:37,935
Lived on this block
my whole life.

1060
01:07:37,968 --> 01:07:39,970
- What's your name?
- Mable.

1061
01:07:41,104 --> 01:07:42,705
Sean.

1062
01:07:43,706 --> 01:07:44,840
Shit.

1063
01:07:44,874 --> 01:07:46,944
Your dad was Ryan Sean.

1064
01:07:46,977 --> 01:07:49,478
That's what they tell me.

1065
01:07:49,512 --> 01:07:51,882
Did some work for me
once upon a time.

1066
01:07:51,915 --> 01:07:53,884
He's a real tough guy, your dad.

1067
01:07:53,917 --> 01:07:57,553
Was he? I wouldn't know.
He wasn't really around much.

1068
01:07:57,586 --> 01:07:59,890
I was sorry about...

1069
01:07:59,923 --> 01:08:02,092
well, what happened to him.

1070
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:03,793
Thank you.

1071
01:08:03,826 --> 01:08:05,828
Neighborhood's funny that way.

1072
01:08:05,861 --> 01:08:09,865
Bad thing happens to a guy,
everyone is so sorry, but...

1073
01:08:11,734 --> 01:08:13,536
...nobody saw a thing.

1074
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:16,872
It was a long time ago.

1075
01:08:16,907 --> 01:08:19,842
And this business, well...

1076
01:08:19,876 --> 01:08:22,611
sometimes bad things happen.

1077
01:08:25,748 --> 01:08:27,951
Mable Sean, where's my son?

1078
01:08:27,985 --> 01:08:31,721
Like I said,
I don't have the foggiest.

1079
01:08:34,024 --> 01:08:36,625
Monk, get the coat.

1080
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:41,999
Mr. Boyle, may I?

1081
01:08:42,032 --> 01:08:44,101
- You recognize this coat?
- Yeah.

1082
01:08:44,134 --> 01:08:45,668
That's Richie's coat.

1083
01:08:45,701 --> 01:08:47,304
And if Richie was to take off

1084
01:08:47,337 --> 01:08:49,906
in the middle of December,
with a marble in his belly,

1085
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:52,575
then Richie, who,
let's all be honest,

1086
01:08:52,608 --> 01:08:54,011
is not known for his planning,

1087
01:08:54,044 --> 01:08:57,680
was probably intending
on stopping somewhere close.

1088
01:08:57,713 --> 01:09:01,318
Maybe he was just going
down the street to her place.

1089
01:09:01,351 --> 01:09:03,786
And you said
you ain't good at riddles.

1090
01:09:04,921 --> 01:09:06,689
When was the last time
you saw my son?

1091
01:09:06,722 --> 01:09:08,892
Here. Earlier today.

1092
01:09:08,925 --> 01:09:11,694
Boss, some bastard
has been ratting on us,

1093
01:09:11,727 --> 01:09:13,030
- right?
- Right.

1094
01:09:13,063 --> 01:09:15,065
What if that
rat bastard is a girl?

1095
01:09:15,865 --> 01:09:17,901
She could have overheard
information from Richie.

1096
01:09:17,934 --> 01:09:19,835
Pillow talk and the like.

1097
01:09:19,869 --> 01:09:21,637
If he shows up at her place

1098
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:24,807
carrying the very thing
that puts the finger on her,

1099
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,043
I'm, I'm just saying.

1100
01:09:26,076 --> 01:09:27,978
We don't know
who she's been ratting to

1101
01:09:28,011 --> 01:09:31,014
or, uh, if he might have been
there when Richie showed up.

1102
01:09:31,048 --> 01:09:32,883
But you don't have to be
Joe Friday

1103
01:09:32,916 --> 01:09:34,084
to put it all together.

1104
01:09:34,117 --> 01:09:35,886
Mr. Boyle.

1105
01:09:35,919 --> 01:09:38,355
I've known Mable...

1106
01:09:38,388 --> 01:09:40,057
I've known Mable for years.

1107
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:43,726
I'm willing to bet my life
she has nothing to do with this.

1108
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:45,694
Oh, I'll take that bet.

1109
01:09:52,802 --> 01:09:53,937
Let's get the lady talking.

1110
01:09:53,970 --> 01:09:54,938
Fuck.

1111
01:09:54,971 --> 01:09:56,106
No, no.

1112
01:09:56,139 --> 01:09:57,740
What is wrong with...?

1113
01:09:57,773 --> 01:09:59,943
- No!
- Where's Richie?

1114
01:09:59,976 --> 01:10:01,677
I don't know.

1115
01:10:03,113 --> 01:10:04,948
Richie was right about you.
You're not a man at all.

1116
01:10:04,981 --> 01:10:06,816
So you and Richie
did do a little talking.

1117
01:10:06,849 --> 01:10:08,818
Back up, English.

1118
01:10:08,851 --> 01:10:10,020
This ain't your purview.

1119
01:10:10,053 --> 01:10:12,022
Yeah, all right,
all right, all right.

1120
01:10:14,424 --> 01:10:17,394
Francis, take her
to the back room.

1121
01:10:17,427 --> 01:10:19,795
Go.

1122
01:10:19,829 --> 01:10:21,630
Mr. Boyle, please.

1123
01:10:21,664 --> 01:10:23,866
- I'm sorry.
- Move.

1124
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:26,036
- I am.
- Sit her down.

1125
01:10:26,069 --> 01:10:28,838
We'll clean up after.

1126
01:10:30,107 --> 01:10:31,707
I-I'm telling you the truth.

1127
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:33,977
All right, the last time
that I saw Richie,

1128
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:35,879
I was...
I-I was inside this shop.

1129
01:10:35,912 --> 01:10:37,713
I was closing up for the night.

1130
01:10:52,028 --> 01:10:53,897
Hey!

1131
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:55,065
Where you think you're going?

1132
01:10:55,098 --> 01:10:57,100
Uh, uh...

1133
01:10:57,134 --> 01:10:59,069
Nobody's going anywhere
until we find my boy.

1134
01:10:59,102 --> 01:11:01,770
Mr. Boyle, sir, I-I...

1135
01:11:01,804 --> 01:11:04,207
I... I can't. I'm sorry.

1136
01:11:04,241 --> 01:11:06,877
- I'll send you away right now.
- Oh, settle.

1137
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:09,146
I know you have to do
wh-what you have to do

1138
01:11:09,179 --> 01:11:10,746
to find your son.

1139
01:11:10,779 --> 01:11:12,015
I understand how you feel.

1140
01:11:12,048 --> 01:11:14,783
You understand how I feel?

1141
01:11:16,086 --> 01:11:18,188
I had a daughter.

1142
01:11:22,259 --> 01:11:26,029
I didn't, I didn't come
to Chicago

1143
01:11:26,062 --> 01:11:28,899
because of...

1144
01:11:28,932 --> 01:11:31,700
uh, blue jeans.

1145
01:11:34,938 --> 01:11:38,774
There was a fire in my shop.

1146
01:11:38,807 --> 01:11:43,046
I-I didn't, I didn't even
notice it at first,

1147
01:11:43,079 --> 01:11:45,115
I was so busy working.

1148
01:11:45,148 --> 01:11:46,815
The fabrics lit up.

1149
01:11:46,849 --> 01:11:49,186
Everything...

1150
01:11:49,219 --> 01:11:52,788
burned so fast.

1151
01:11:55,258 --> 01:11:59,762
My wife and my little girl,
they lived upstairs.

1152
01:12:01,231 --> 01:12:03,300
I heard them.

1153
01:12:09,372 --> 01:12:13,709
The shears,
they was a gift from my wife.

1154
01:12:15,879 --> 01:12:17,881
So, you understand.

1155
01:12:17,914 --> 01:12:20,016
Boss, you don't have
to listen to...

1156
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:21,750
Quiet.

1157
01:12:24,287 --> 01:12:26,156
Mr. Boyle...

1158
01:12:26,923 --> 01:12:31,261
...you can hurt young Mable,
you can hurt me,

1159
01:12:31,294 --> 01:12:37,100
you can kill any one of us
with a snap of your fingers...

1160
01:12:39,102 --> 01:12:41,304
...but it won't find
your child...

1161
01:12:43,173 --> 01:12:45,208
...no matter how much
you want it...

1162
01:12:52,215 --> 01:12:53,950
Go get it.

1163
01:12:59,155 --> 01:13:01,124
Hello?

1164
01:13:02,359 --> 01:13:04,160
Oh.

1165
01:13:04,194 --> 01:13:06,029
Really?

1166
01:13:06,062 --> 01:13:08,365
We've all been
tremendously worried.

1167
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:11,234
20 minutes?

1168
01:13:11,268 --> 01:13:12,902
Fantastic.

1169
01:13:12,936 --> 01:13:15,272
Yes, yes, of course, I will.

1170
01:13:15,305 --> 01:13:17,107
All right.

1171
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:18,275
Thank you.

1172
01:13:22,312 --> 01:13:23,947
What was that?

1173
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:26,016
That was Richie.

1174
01:13:27,917 --> 01:13:30,253
He said he's in hiding
from the La Fontaines,

1175
01:13:30,287 --> 01:13:31,820
but he has the tape

1176
01:13:31,854 --> 01:13:33,089
and he wants you to go
pick him up.

1177
01:13:33,123 --> 01:13:36,226
31st and Halsted.

1178
01:13:36,259 --> 01:13:37,927
20 minutes.

1179
01:13:38,728 --> 01:13:42,065
Before I-I could get
any more details...

1180
01:13:42,098 --> 01:13:44,800
he was gone.

1181
01:13:55,378 --> 01:13:57,981
Let's go.

1182
01:13:58,014 --> 01:13:59,916
We'll swing by the house

1183
01:13:59,949 --> 01:14:01,318
and pick up whoever's there
to come with us.

1184
01:14:01,351 --> 01:14:04,120
Hey, may-maybe we should
just take a minute.

1185
01:14:04,154 --> 01:14:06,456
My son is waiting.

1186
01:14:06,489 --> 01:14:10,060
For what are we gonna take
a goddamn minute?

1187
01:14:11,995 --> 01:14:13,862
Let's get to it.

1188
01:14:26,276 --> 01:14:28,278
Boss?

1189
01:14:31,281 --> 01:14:34,250
Maybe I should wait back.
Keep an eye on them, huh?

1190
01:14:34,284 --> 01:14:36,353
I need all the firepower I got.

1191
01:14:36,386 --> 01:14:39,356
You really want to
trust Richie's life to the hope

1192
01:14:39,389 --> 01:14:42,926
that tonight doesn't have
any more twists in store?

1193
01:14:42,959 --> 01:14:45,128
If the devil himself
came crashing through the roof,

1194
01:14:45,161 --> 01:14:47,163
I wouldn't be shocked right now.

1195
01:14:49,999 --> 01:14:51,134
All right.

1196
01:14:52,168 --> 01:14:54,170
All right.
Belts and suspenders.

1197
01:14:55,405 --> 01:14:57,340
Make sure they don't go nowhere.

1198
01:15:40,483 --> 01:15:42,519
You want to tell me
who the fuck you just talked to

1199
01:15:42,552 --> 01:15:44,087
on that phone?

1200
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:45,989
That was one of Mr. Boyle's men

1201
01:15:46,022 --> 01:15:49,392
calling to say
he'd yet to hear from Richie.

1202
01:15:51,394 --> 01:15:52,529
Hmm.

1203
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:55,365
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1204
01:15:55,398 --> 01:15:56,533
Either I kill her now

1205
01:15:56,566 --> 01:15:58,468
and we pin tonight
on her corpse...

1206
01:15:59,302 --> 01:16:02,172
...or I kill both of you
and do it all myself.

1207
01:16:02,205 --> 01:16:03,540
It's, it's your choice.

1208
01:16:03,573 --> 01:16:05,408
You need her assistance.

1209
01:16:05,442 --> 01:16:07,377
With what do I need
her assistance?

1210
01:16:07,410 --> 01:16:10,380
Roy Boyle is about to walk
directly into an ambush.

1211
01:16:10,413 --> 01:16:13,016
- Who's ambushing him?
- The La Fontaines.

1212
01:16:13,049 --> 01:16:14,484
And how exactly
are the La Fontaines

1213
01:16:14,517 --> 01:16:16,252
gonna know where to ambush him?

1214
01:16:16,286 --> 01:16:17,554
Because Mable's
about to tell them.

1215
01:16:17,587 --> 01:16:19,055
- Me?
- Yes, you.

1216
01:16:19,088 --> 01:16:22,492
- Why me?
- Because you're the rat.

1217
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:29,399
You've been sleeping
with Richie Boyle.

1218
01:16:29,432 --> 01:16:31,201
You kept hearing him talk about

1219
01:16:31,234 --> 01:16:34,537
his father's escalating war
with the La Fontaines

1220
01:16:34,571 --> 01:16:37,106
and you saw your chance.

1221
01:16:39,142 --> 01:16:41,511
<i>You sold information
to La Fontaine</i>

1222
01:16:41,544 --> 01:16:46,249
<i>so that you could finally
get out of Chicago.</i>

1223
01:16:51,087 --> 01:16:55,225
But Francis...
Francis is paranoid.

1224
01:16:55,258 --> 01:16:59,262
Sooner or later, you thought
he would have found you out.

1225
01:17:00,063 --> 01:17:03,466
<i>So you helped the FBI
to plant a bug.</i>

1226
01:17:05,101 --> 01:17:08,505
<i>If the FBI could take down
the Boyle crew,</i>

1227
01:17:08,538 --> 01:17:10,206
<i>you could get away clean.</i>

1228
01:17:11,541 --> 01:17:13,576
<i>But you didn't plan
for one thing:</i>

1229
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:18,281
The Outfit.

1230
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:23,219
<i>They told the Boyles
about the bug.</i>

1231
01:17:23,253 --> 01:17:24,420
<i>Richie told you.</i>

1232
01:17:24,454 --> 01:17:27,223
<i>What could you do?</i>

1233
01:17:29,292 --> 01:17:31,327
<i>You told La Fontaine.</i>

1234
01:17:35,598 --> 01:17:39,003
And hoped that they would
all kill each other...

1235
01:17:39,702 --> 01:17:42,071
...before they found you.

1236
01:17:52,515 --> 01:17:55,552
You got your hustle.
I got mine.

1237
01:17:56,553 --> 01:17:58,354
You were, you were
the fucking rat?

1238
01:17:58,388 --> 01:18:00,123
I've spent my entire life

1239
01:18:00,156 --> 01:18:03,126
watching you leeches
suck this neighborhood dry.

1240
01:18:03,159 --> 01:18:05,495
I am gonna love...

1241
01:18:05,528 --> 01:18:08,565
sitting in a café in Paris,

1242
01:18:08,598 --> 01:18:11,534
reading all about your funeral.

1243
01:18:11,568 --> 01:18:13,536
You stole the tape?

1244
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:16,472
No. That was me.

1245
01:18:33,623 --> 01:18:35,458
You knew what I was doing,

1246
01:18:35,491 --> 01:18:37,260
and instead of stopping me,
you helped.

1247
01:18:37,293 --> 01:18:38,561
- Yes.
- Fuck you.

1248
01:18:38,595 --> 01:18:40,330
I can take care of myself.

1249
01:18:41,464 --> 01:18:45,602
If she doesn't call
the La Fontaines in the next...

1250
01:18:47,403 --> 01:18:49,305
...two minutes, I'd say,

1251
01:18:49,339 --> 01:18:54,711
Roy Boyle will return,
having failed to find his son.

1252
01:18:54,744 --> 01:18:58,314
Eventually,
he'll discover Richie,

1253
01:18:58,348 --> 01:19:00,617
and then he'll kill all of us.

1254
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:04,487
Or Mable can tell
the La Fontaines

1255
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:08,625
where to ambush him
and offer to sell them the tape.

1256
01:19:10,259 --> 01:19:11,761
Now tell me,

1257
01:19:11,794 --> 01:19:16,934
if Roy Boyle and all his
senior lieutenants die tonight,

1258
01:19:16,967 --> 01:19:21,137
who will be in charge
of his organization?

1259
01:19:23,406 --> 01:19:25,475
I took six bullets for that man.

1260
01:19:25,508 --> 01:19:27,677
And how many has he taken
for you?

1261
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:31,247
He made me everything
that I am today.

1262
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:36,219
And today is the day
that you don't need him anymore.

1263
01:19:37,087 --> 01:19:40,623
You think I'm just gonna
betray Roy Boyle that easy?

1264
01:19:40,657 --> 01:19:43,593
No, I don't think it's easy.

1265
01:19:43,626 --> 01:19:47,730
I think option A is: we all die.

1266
01:19:47,764 --> 01:19:51,367
And option B is:

1267
01:19:51,401 --> 01:19:54,170
you run the Boyle organization.

1268
01:20:13,623 --> 01:20:16,225
Make the goddamn call.

1269
01:20:22,632 --> 01:20:25,301
I'm not here.

1270
01:20:41,885 --> 01:20:44,587
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

1271
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:48,524
...Stetson.

1272
01:20:48,558 --> 01:20:50,027
Stetson.

1273
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:52,395
Yes, um...

1274
01:20:55,765 --> 01:20:57,366
...Roy Boyle...

1275
01:21:04,407 --> 01:21:05,742
...Halsted.

1276
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:12,615
...La Fontaine...

1277
01:21:19,655 --> 01:21:21,557
La Fontaine wants
to make a deal.

1278
01:21:21,591 --> 01:21:23,559
Tape for cash. One hour.

1279
01:21:23,593 --> 01:21:25,595
I didn't know you spoke French.

1280
01:21:25,628 --> 01:21:27,396
Francis,

1281
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:30,299
the number of things about me
that you don't know...

1282
01:21:33,469 --> 01:21:35,538
So what the fuck
really happened to Richie?

1283
01:22:10,773 --> 01:22:12,508
That's La Fontaine.

1284
01:22:12,542 --> 01:22:14,477
I'm gonna hide in the back.

1285
01:22:14,510 --> 01:22:16,412
As soon as you peep the green,
you toss me a signal.

1286
01:22:16,445 --> 01:22:17,948
"Count's right." And then...

1287
01:22:19,482 --> 01:22:20,850
This is a stupid fucking idea.

1288
01:22:20,884 --> 01:22:22,552
You don't toss me a signal,

1289
01:22:22,585 --> 01:22:24,654
I'm gonna come out firing
indiscriminate-like.

1290
01:22:24,687 --> 01:22:27,925
When La Fontaine dies tonight,
I'm not only leading our crew,

1291
01:22:27,958 --> 01:22:30,326
I'm leading them
into the Outfit.

1292
01:22:31,527 --> 01:22:33,462
It's the least I could do.
For Roy.

1293
01:22:48,477 --> 01:22:50,446
He's gonna kill us, too.

1294
01:22:58,454 --> 01:22:59,689
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

1295
01:22:59,722 --> 01:23:00,991
You're open late.

1296
01:23:01,024 --> 01:23:03,927
Mm. We work by appointment.

1297
01:23:03,961 --> 01:23:05,896
This is Mr. Burling.

1298
01:23:07,830 --> 01:23:11,001
I didn't know this city
had any tailors so classy.

1299
01:23:11,034 --> 01:23:13,636
Thank you.

1300
01:23:14,437 --> 01:23:16,173
You know how to make clothes
for a lady?

1301
01:23:16,206 --> 01:23:17,908
I haven't a clue.

1302
01:23:17,941 --> 01:23:19,943
<i>Désolé.</i>

1303
01:23:20,944 --> 01:23:22,712
I might have an inkling.

1304
01:23:27,650 --> 01:23:29,619
Oh.

1305
01:23:38,061 --> 01:23:41,965
I'm guessing it's been
quite an evening for you folks.

1306
01:23:41,999 --> 01:23:45,501
Hazard of the trade, madame.

1307
01:23:49,572 --> 01:23:51,574
Which one of you has my tape?

1308
01:23:51,607 --> 01:23:53,010
Money first.

1309
01:24:02,818 --> 01:24:04,620
Please.

1310
01:24:30,813 --> 01:24:31,814
Looks like...

1311
01:24:31,847 --> 01:24:34,251
Madame La Fontaine,

1312
01:24:34,284 --> 01:24:35,919
are you trying to rob us?

1313
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:37,988
Where's the money?

1314
01:24:45,828 --> 01:24:49,565
We're not showing you the tape
until we see the money.

1315
01:24:49,598 --> 01:24:50,968
Tape first.

1316
01:24:51,001 --> 01:24:53,703
How do I know what's on it?
I've gotta listen.

1317
01:24:53,736 --> 01:24:54,972
Well, it seems like

1318
01:24:55,005 --> 01:24:56,706
you're just gonna
have to trust us.

1319
01:24:56,739 --> 01:24:57,941
<i>Ou, peut-être,</i>

1320
01:24:57,975 --> 01:25:00,609
we may be able
to trust each other.

1321
01:25:12,155 --> 01:25:14,724
Okay.

1322
01:25:14,757 --> 01:25:16,059
Let's make a deal.

1323
01:25:17,727 --> 01:25:21,298
You give me the green,
I'll walk away.

1324
01:25:21,331 --> 01:25:23,934
We all live to kill each other
some other time.

1325
01:25:23,967 --> 01:25:26,470
You know what makes me mad?

1326
01:25:27,603 --> 01:25:31,908
I've been running numbers
in this city my whole life.

1327
01:25:32,976 --> 01:25:35,145
But nobody said a thing.

1328
01:25:35,178 --> 01:25:39,749
Cops, racket boys,
nobody even noticed.

1329
01:25:39,782 --> 01:25:44,854
Until the second
we started making real money.

1330
01:25:44,888 --> 01:25:48,758
<i>Mon Dieu,</i> this fucking city.

1331
01:25:50,693 --> 01:25:54,898
Since day one, people like me,
people like our English friend,

1332
01:25:54,931 --> 01:25:58,768
we come here and we make
something of ourselves.

1333
01:25:58,801 --> 01:26:00,870
And then right as soon
as we get big enough,

1334
01:26:00,904 --> 01:26:04,041
you <i>connards</i> show up

1335
01:26:04,074 --> 01:26:06,842
with your hair slicked back,

1336
01:26:06,877 --> 01:26:09,745
shoes all shiny,

1337
01:26:09,779 --> 01:26:11,982
and you snatch it away.

1338
01:26:13,749 --> 01:26:16,852
Like a spoiled child
who'd rather break his own toys

1339
01:26:16,887 --> 01:26:18,989
than watch somebody else
play with them.

1340
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:29,066
So I will admit to a...

1341
01:26:29,099 --> 01:26:32,969
satisfaction earlier

1342
01:26:33,003 --> 01:26:36,940
at 31st and Halsted

1343
01:26:36,973 --> 01:26:39,876
when I put a gun
to Roy Boyle's head

1344
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:43,914
and watched him die
as he'd lived.

1345
01:26:46,149 --> 01:26:49,685
Sorry he ever met me.

1346
01:26:49,718 --> 01:26:51,988
Madame,

1347
01:26:52,022 --> 01:26:54,857
you have nothing to fear
from this man.

1348
01:26:54,891 --> 01:26:56,993
Why is that?

1349
01:26:57,027 --> 01:27:00,629
Because earlier this evening,

1350
01:27:00,663 --> 01:27:03,766
I removed all the bullets
from his gun.

1351
01:27:17,881 --> 01:27:20,117
Any other killers in here
I should know about?

1352
01:27:28,058 --> 01:27:30,093
Only you.

1353
01:27:36,765 --> 01:27:38,101
A tailor.

1354
01:27:40,170 --> 01:27:42,671
Always listening, never talking.

1355
01:27:43,706 --> 01:27:49,112
But nobody stop to think:
"What's going on in his head?"

1356
01:28:02,492 --> 01:28:06,029
I'm not a tailor, ma'am.

1357
01:28:06,062 --> 01:28:07,964
I'm a cutter.

1358
01:28:11,834 --> 01:28:14,104
<i>Un coupeur.</i>

1359
01:28:18,275 --> 01:28:20,076
<i>Au revoir.</i>

1360
01:28:36,293 --> 01:28:38,094
Mm.

1361
01:28:40,530 --> 01:28:42,265
They'll find us out.

1362
01:28:43,266 --> 01:28:45,902
The Boyles are all dead.

1363
01:28:46,903 --> 01:28:48,171
The Outfit, then.

1364
01:28:48,205 --> 01:28:50,941
Why would the Outfit
come looking for us?

1365
01:28:50,974 --> 01:28:54,177
Because we took the tape
that everyone is loo...

1366
01:29:23,006 --> 01:29:25,375
<i>To the naked eye,</i>

1367
01:29:25,408 --> 01:29:28,979
a suit appears
to consist of two parts...

1368
01:29:29,012 --> 01:29:30,313
The tape.

1369
01:29:30,347 --> 01:29:33,550
...a jacket and trousers.

1370
01:29:33,583 --> 01:29:35,218
It's just a fake.

1371
01:29:35,252 --> 01:29:38,321
But these two
seemingly solid parts

1372
01:29:38,355 --> 01:29:41,992
are composed of
four different fabrics.

1373
01:29:42,025 --> 01:29:44,928
<i>The Outfit has never even
heard of Roy Boyle.</i>

1374
01:29:48,198 --> 01:29:51,201
<i>They didn't send those messages.</i>

1375
01:29:51,234 --> 01:29:53,203
<i>You did.</i>

1376
01:29:54,837 --> 01:29:57,173
<i>You've been planning this
for months.</i>

1377
01:29:58,841 --> 01:30:00,977
<i>Everything that happened.</i>

1378
01:30:01,978 --> 01:30:04,214
You set it all up.

1379
01:30:07,917 --> 01:30:12,922
This contains everything
that went on here this evening.

1380
01:30:12,956 --> 01:30:15,325
Enough to convict
any remaining Boyles

1381
01:30:15,358 --> 01:30:17,127
of a dozen crimes

1382
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:20,030
and Madame La Fontaine
of the murder of Roy Boyle.

1383
01:30:20,063 --> 01:30:22,299
You won't mind, will you,
popping it in the post

1384
01:30:22,332 --> 01:30:24,167
to your friend at the FBI?

1385
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,069
On your way to...

1386
01:30:28,104 --> 01:30:29,838
Perhaps it's safest if...

1387
01:30:31,074 --> 01:30:33,209
...I don't know.

1388
01:30:33,243 --> 01:30:36,346
But make it somewhere grand.

1389
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:53,163
So what about you?

1390
01:30:53,196 --> 01:30:54,931
Oh, I've started over before.

1391
01:30:54,964 --> 01:30:57,100
It'll be easier the second time.

1392
01:30:59,502 --> 01:31:01,204
- Come with me.
- No.

1393
01:31:02,205 --> 01:31:04,341
No, come with me.

1394
01:31:04,374 --> 01:31:07,143
You can show me things
you've already seen.

1395
01:31:07,177 --> 01:31:10,447
You will not spend
your best years

1396
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:13,383
taking care of my remaining few.

1397
01:31:20,056 --> 01:31:22,092
I was taking care of
myself just fine, you know.

1398
01:31:22,125 --> 01:31:23,993
Oh, yes.

1399
01:31:24,027 --> 01:31:27,230
Knowing you, I'm quite confident
you'd have seen to the burials

1400
01:31:27,263 --> 01:31:30,133
of each and every one
of those murderers.

1401
01:31:30,166 --> 01:31:32,969
But then...

1402
01:31:33,002 --> 01:31:36,039
you'd no longer be pretending
to be one,

1403
01:31:36,072 --> 01:31:38,141
would you?

1404
01:31:58,027 --> 01:31:59,896
I wish I could have met her.

1405
01:32:02,332 --> 01:32:04,701
Your real...

1406
01:32:04,734 --> 01:32:06,202
you know.

1407
01:32:12,175 --> 01:32:14,244
She would have liked you.

1408
01:32:58,388 --> 01:33:01,424
<i>Finishings, for me,
can be the hardest part.</i>

1409
01:33:05,528 --> 01:33:08,198
<i>Not because there's
any great skill involved</i>

1410
01:33:08,231 --> 01:33:11,301
<i>in these final steps...</i>

1411
01:33:14,370 --> 01:33:17,240
<i>...putting on a few buttons,
closing up a few edges,</i>

1412
01:33:17,273 --> 01:33:21,377
<i>but because
if you've done your job,</i>

1413
01:33:21,411 --> 01:33:25,381
<i>all the true craftsmanship
has already occurred.</i>

1414
01:33:26,182 --> 01:33:29,519
<i>The finishings are
mere inevitabilities.</i>

1415
01:33:43,266 --> 01:33:45,068
<i>It's at the finishings</i>

1416
01:33:45,101 --> 01:33:48,505
<i>that you must come to terms
with the idea</i>

1417
01:33:48,538 --> 01:33:52,542
<i>that perfection
is a necessary goal...</i>

1418
01:33:55,278 --> 01:34:00,049
<i>...precisely because
it is unattainable.</i>

1419
01:34:05,688 --> 01:34:10,093
<i>If you don't aim for perfection,
you cannot make anything great.</i>

1420
01:34:10,126 --> 01:34:13,596
<i>And yet, true perfection
is impossible.</i>

1421
01:35:13,623 --> 01:35:15,325
Oh.

1422
01:35:22,699 --> 01:35:24,334
Oh, no.

1423
01:35:35,511 --> 01:35:37,480
Stop.

1424
01:35:52,795 --> 01:35:55,164
<i>So at the finish,</i>

1425
01:35:55,198 --> 01:35:57,500
<i>you must reconcile yourself...</i>

1426
01:35:58,501 --> 01:35:59,702
<i>...to failure.</i>

1427
01:36:04,741 --> 01:36:07,377
I was like you once.

1428
01:36:07,410 --> 01:36:09,178
I was.

1429
01:36:10,813 --> 01:36:13,416
Made my living with a gun.

1430
01:36:14,417 --> 01:36:16,386
A knife.

1431
01:36:18,554 --> 01:36:20,490
Sometimes...

1432
01:36:22,358 --> 01:36:24,227
...just my bare hands.

1433
01:36:28,698 --> 01:36:30,400
I'd...

1434
01:36:33,236 --> 01:36:36,773
I'd a gift, they said.

1435
01:36:39,308 --> 01:36:41,444
But it wasn't magic.

1436
01:36:42,445 --> 01:36:44,514
It was work.

1437
01:36:59,328 --> 01:37:04,200
One day, they asked me to do
something I couldn't do.

1438
01:37:05,601 --> 01:37:07,303
So I ran. I hid.

1439
01:37:07,336 --> 01:37:08,838
I hid on the Row.

1440
01:37:08,871 --> 01:37:12,742
Picked up a trade,
learnt a craft, and met my wife.

1441
01:37:16,612 --> 01:37:18,381
Vera.

1442
01:37:19,382 --> 01:37:21,317
I fell in love.

1443
01:37:21,350 --> 01:37:24,454
We had little Lily.
I fell in love again.

1444
01:37:27,557 --> 01:37:29,592
But they found me.

1445
01:37:32,361 --> 01:37:33,730
They found me.

1446
01:37:35,331 --> 01:37:38,735
Set fire to my shop.

1447
01:37:40,369 --> 01:37:41,838
My home.

1448
01:37:44,741 --> 01:37:46,375
My life.

01:37:47,177 --> 01:37:51,347
I came here to get away
from all that violence.

1450
01:37:52,381 --> 01:37:54,617
Get away from myself.

1451
01:37:56,419 --> 01:37:59,655
M-My first day here,
who did I meet?

1452
01:37:59,689 --> 01:38:01,724
Huh.

1453
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:06,897
I suppose I put, put on
these clothes

1454
01:38:06,930 --> 01:38:12,301
to convince myself
I'm civilized.

1455
01:38:14,637 --> 01:38:17,673
I want so bad to be good.

1456
01:39:27,677 --> 01:39:29,712
<i>It's not perfect.</i>

1457
01:39:29,745 --> 01:39:31,848
<i>You have to make your peace
with that.</i>

1458
01:39:36,954 --> 01:39:38,654
<i>How?</i>

1459
01:39:42,625 --> 01:39:44,727
<i>Well...</i>

1460
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:46,696
<i>you sit at your board,</i>

1461
01:39:46,729 --> 01:39:49,665
<i>you lay out your tools...</i>

1462
01:39:50,666 --> 01:39:53,536
<i>...and you start again.</i>

1463
01:39:58,574 --> 01:40:03,574
