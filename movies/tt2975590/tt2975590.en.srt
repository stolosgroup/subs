1
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:20,185
<i>There was a time above.</i>

2
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,855
<i>A time before.</i>

3
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:25,824
<i>There were perfect things,</i>

4
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:28,127
<i>diamond absolutes.</i>

5
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,530
<i>How things fall.</i>

6
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:34,033
<i>Things on earth.</i>

7
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:36,068
<i>And what falls...</i>

8
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,169
Master Wayne!

9
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,004
<i>Is fallen.</i> Bruce!

10
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:42,441
<i>Bruce, it's all right.</i>

11
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,378
<i>Bruce, please.</i>

12
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,757
Martha.

13
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:47,653
<i>In the dream,</i>
<i>they took me to the light.</i>

14
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,554
<i>A beautiful lie.</i>

15
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,168
<i>Jack.</i> Bruce.

16
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,936
Jack, listen to me.

17
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:40,605
I want you to get everyone
out of the building right now.

18
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,441
<i>You understand?</i> My god.

19
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:44,142
<i>Stay away from the windows!</i>

20
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,278
Let's go. Come on.
Start moving now, people. Let's go.

21
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,380
The boss wants us out of the building,
so let's make it happen.

22
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:50,582
Jack. Jack!

23
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,984
<i>We're sorry.</i>

24
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:37,456
<i>All circuits are busy now.
Will you please try your call again later?</i>

25
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,358
Heavenly god,

26
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:44,329
creator of heaven and earth,

27
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,031
have mercy on my soul.

28
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,702
Jack!

29
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,977
Buddy hands!
Everybody show me! Good job!

30
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,712
Come on, guys.

31
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,582
<i>Hold on tight.</i>

32
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,018
<i>Come on, guys.</i>

33
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,621
Go.

34
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:43,855
<i>Mr. Wayne!</i>

35
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,359
Mr. Wayne!
I can't feel my legs.

36
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:48,793
I can't feel my legs.

37
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:51,029
We need help over here!

38
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,497
Help me. I can't feel my legs.

39
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:55,000
You're gonna be okay.
You hear me?

40
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:57,402
Wallace? What do they
call you, Wally?

41
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,639
You're the boss, boss.

42
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,476
All right.
You're gonna be okay.

43
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:06,011
Easy, easy. Come on.

44
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,416
My god. I can't move my leg.

45
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,752
<i>My god. I can't feel my legs.</i>

46
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,995
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

47
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:27,399
You're okay. All right?

48
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,000
You know what?
We're gonna find your mom.

49
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:30,635
Where is she?

50
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,193
All that wind is bad luck.

51
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,228
Blood in the sky.

52
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,763
There she is!

53
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,239
Miss Lane.

54
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,710
<i>Miss Lane. Jimmy Olsen.</i>

55
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,878
Photographer. Obviously.

56
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,313
Where's heron?

57
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,115
Trouble at the border.

58
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:02,387
So, how'd you land it?
This is, like, pioneer stuff.

59
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,723
Amajagh's never given
an interview.

60
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,792
You know what heron always
says when we're on assignment together?

61
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,662
Not a goddamn thing.

62
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:12,797
I like heron.

63
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,746
Let's go.

64
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,521
<i>Passports.</i>
<i>Electronics. Phones. Camera.</i>

65
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:39,090
Your fixer said that
the general approved photos.

66
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,922
Are you a terrorist, general?

67
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:13,758
They did not tell me
the interview was with a lady.

68
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,060
I'm not a lady.
I'm a journalist.

69
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:22,100
<i>What I am is a man with nothing</i>

70
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:25,804
<i>except a love of my people.</i>

71
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,806
Who's paying for these
security contractors, General?

72
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,708
Who pays for the drones
that pass over our heads at night?

73
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,112
<i>One question begs another.</i>

74
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,780
<i>Yes?</i>

75
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,615
<i>Say what you're</i>
<i>saying, general.</i>

76
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,918
It's just a camera.

77
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,821
The United States has declared
its neutrality in your country's civil war

78
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,790
both in policy and
in principle.

79
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,560
Don't open...
You just exposed...

80
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:53,164
These pious
American fictions...

81
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,833
<i>spoken like truth.</i>

82
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,901
Okay. That's my film.

83
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,110
Men with power obey neither policy
nor principle, Miss Lane.

84
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,515
<i>No one is different.</i>

85
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,618
No one is neutral.

86
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,462
CIA.

87
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,532
They're tracking us!

88
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,434
You!

89
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,873
You're CIA?

90
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,407
What? No. No!

91
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,543
You brought him here!
No, he's a photographer.

92
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,880
No!

93
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,253
It's okay, Lois.

94
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,538
Talon's down, sir.

95
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,741
Python, we have lost our
asset on the ground.

96
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,910
Repeat, we have lost our
asset on the ground.

97
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,913
There's still a civilian in the compound.
We'll extract her.

98
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,849
<i>Negative. Rpa to engage.</i>
<i>Stand down and get black.</i>

99
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:21,185
There'll be friendlies
in the blast zone, so...

100
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,388
Call off the goddamn drone.

101
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,024
Stand down is an order. Python?

102
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,659
Let's move!

103
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,535
I...

104
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:38,970
I didn't know.

105
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:43,942
Ignorance is not
the same as innocence,

106
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,310
miss Lane.

107
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,540
Get up! Stand up!

108
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,821
Quickly. He's coming.

109
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,669
Inbound 2 Mikes.

110
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,171
<i>Passing python now.</i>

111
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,414
Move out!

112
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,524
Target locked.
You are clear to engage.

113
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,226
Armed hot and in range.

114
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,966
<i>Three.</i>

115
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,903
Two. One.

116
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,049
Link's been hit.

117
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,617
By what?

118
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,589
Take one step,

119
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,491
you will see
the inside of her head.

120
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,011
<i>The women</i>
<i>in the village heard a noise.</i>

121
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:12,617
Like the sky cracked open.

122
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:17,321
He came down. Then came fire.

123
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,659
<i>Even worse came after.</i>

124
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,995
<i>The government attacked.</i>

125
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,831
<i>No mercy in the villages.</i>

126
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,400
My parents tried to run.

127
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:37,208
The world has been
so caught up with what Superman can do

128
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,678
that no one has asked
what he should do.

129
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,983
Let the record show
that this committee holds him responsible.

130
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:48,152
<i>He'll never answer to you.</i>

131
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:50,821
He answers to no one.

132
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,291
Not even, I think, to god.

133
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,495
<i>58 to nothing.</i>

134
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,697
<i>Metropolis, again,</i>
<i>blowing out Gotham city.</i>

135
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,166
<i>Really, only the diehards</i>
<i>are left in the stands.</i>

136
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:04,368
<i>Delta Charlie 27.
Reports of screams coming from vacant home</i>

<i>at 1939 harborway.</i>

138
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,838
<i>Tom, it's been great</i>
<i>working with you.</i>

139
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,141
<i>I want to thank our</i>
<i>producer and director.</i>

140
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:11,676
<i>Now wait a second.
I don't even want to suggest...</i>

141
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:12,543
<i>Delta Charlie 27, respond.</i>

142
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,845
Just take a knee.

143
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:16,914
<i>They're lining up as if Clarkson is gonna
throw it deep here.</i>

144
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,150
<i>- Don't tell me, Dave.</i>
<i>- Going to the end zone!</i>

145
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:21,352
<i>- This is unnecessary.</i>
<i>- Delta Charlie 27.</i>

146
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,187
<i>- Zeke Baker is open.</i>
<i>- Baker with a touchdown catch!</i>

147
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,855
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>I just watched that.</i>

148
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,424
<i>Delta Charlie 27. Do you copy?</i>

149
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,759
10-4. We're on it.

150
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,995
<i>And now a fight breaks out.</i>

151
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:34,232
<i>Gotham City, you know how they are about
their football team.</i>

152
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:37,201
<i>Things could get ugly</i>
<i>in the city tonight.</i>

153
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,611
Go.

154
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,658
It's okay.

155
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,259
It's okay.

156
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:38,062
We're gonna help.
We're here to help.

157
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:40,498
We're gonna get you
out of here. Okay?

158
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,043
I don't understand.

159
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,683
<i>Please don't. Please don't.</i>

160
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:10,528
<i>Please. I don't know who he is.</i>

00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,032
<i>I don't know who he is!</i>

<i>No!</i>

00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,258
<i>Fuck.</i>

164
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:22,533
Christ!

165
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:24,101
I saw him.

166
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:25,903
<i>I never saw him before.</i>
<i>I... I didn't know.</i>

167
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,705
You almost took my face off.

168
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:30,141
How about you don't shoot
the good guys?

169
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:35,679
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

170
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,281
<i>He branded him.</i>

171
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,173
Hey. Hey.

172
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:10,441
I was gonna cook.

173
00:25:10,443 --> 00:25:12,076
Surprise you.

174
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,583
They held hearings
about what happened.

175
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,319
<i>They're saying that...</i>
I don't care.

176
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:24,722
I don't care
what they're saying.

177
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,292
The woman I love could have
been blown up or shot.

178
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:29,994
<i>Think of what</i>
<i>could have happened.</i>

179
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:32,463
Well, think about
what did happen.

180
00:25:32,465 --> 00:25:34,865
I didn't kill those men,
if that's what they think.

181
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,634
<i>If that's what you're saying.</i>

182
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:39,069
No, I'm saying I want to
understand what happened.

183
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,806
I'm saying thank you
for saving my life.

184
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:44,608
<i>I'm saying there's a cost.</i>

185
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,553
I just don't know
if it's possible.

186
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,455
Don't know if what's possible?

187
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,761
For you to love me and be you.

188
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:32,756
Clark!

189
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,360
Clark, you're going
to flood the apartment.

190
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,564
You still working?

191
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:15,966
You're getting slow
in your old age, Alfred.

192
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:19,336
Comes to us all, master Wayne.

193
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:22,039
Even you got
too old to die young.

194
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,876
And not for lack of trying.

195
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,280
<i>Funnel-ferry butterbar.</i>
<i>Funnel-ferry butterbar.</i>

196
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,316
<i>Funnel-ferry butterbar.</i>
<i>Funnel-ferry...</i>

197
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:34,485
There's nothing wrong
with the microphone.

198
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:37,621
It's this new layer of armor.

199
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,556
I'll just have to rewire.

200
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:45,996
So, last night was productive?

201
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:49,933
No. He's too low-level.
He knew nothing.

202
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:52,369
This is the man
who knows things.

203
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:56,273
Anatoli Knyazev. He's Russian.

204
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:57,808
Contracts all over the globe,

205
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,176
<i>but he's based out of</i>
<i>the port of Gotham.</i>

206
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,978
<i>Weapons and human trafficking.</i>

207
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,846
<i>So the white Portuguese
is a Russian.</i>

208
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,982
<i>That's the theory.</i>

209
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:09,620
No. The theory is that the Russian
will lead me to the man himself.

210
00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:13,624
If he is, indeed, a "him."

211
00:28:13,626 --> 00:28:15,025
You don't even know
if he exists.

212
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,560
Could be a phantasm.

213
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:19,797
One that wants to bring
a dirty bomb into Gotham?

214
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,598
High-stakes round.

215
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,570
<i>New rules.</i>

216
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,175
We're criminals, Alfred.

217
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:33,711
We've always been criminals.
Nothing's changed.

218
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,880
Yes, it has, sir.

219
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,117
Everything's changed.

220
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:46,790
<i>Men fall from the sky.</i>

221
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,394
The gods hurl thunderbolts.

222
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:53,130
<i>Innocents die.</i>

223
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:57,034
<i>That's how it starts, sir.</i>

224
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:59,203
<i>The fever. The rage.</i>

225
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:02,139
The feeling of powerlessness.

226
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:08,145
It turns good men cruel.

227
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,092
<i>John, get d.</i>

228
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,862
Ooh. Ahoy, ahoy!
I did not know you were here.

229
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,930
Man on the marquee.
Yeah, don't believe it.

230
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,565
My father named the company
after himself.

231
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:30,768
He was the Lex in front of
the corp. How you doin'?

232
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,369
Really great.

233
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,938
Really great? Good. Good.
Follow me.

234
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,641
No, dad started saying
that he named the company,

235
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:39,443
after his kid
at investor pitches.

236
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,745
Rich old ladies. They thought
it was very cute, you know?

237
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:43,614
"Write check for Lex."

238
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:46,784
You know, dad was born
in east Germany.

239
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:49,119
He grew up eating,
stale crackers.

240
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,321
And every other Saturday,
he had to march in a parade

241
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:53,390
and wave flowers at tyrants.

242
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:57,127
So, I think it was Providence
that his son, me,

243
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,729
would end up with this.

244
00:29:58,731 --> 00:30:01,331
One of my rebuild Metropolis
crews found it.

245
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,934
<i>Little souvenir from</i>
<i>the Kryptonian world engine.</i>

246
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:05,769
What does a rock have to do
with homeland security?

247
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:07,771
Homeland security?

248
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:11,475
No, no, no, ma'am,
planetary security.

249
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,510
<i>The fragment is of a
radioactive xenomineral.</i>

250
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:16,313
<i>We suspected it might</i>
<i>have bio-interactions,</i>

251
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:19,316
so we took the sample
to amriid,

252
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:22,452
where they keep the remains
of the Kryptonian decedent.

253
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:25,956
And, when we exposed
general Zod to the mineral,

254
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:28,158
this happened.

255
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,629
<i>Profound biodegradation.</i>
<i>Decaying Kryptonian cells.</i>

256
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:34,164
We concluded the mineral
could be weaponized

257
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,699
if a large enough
sample was found.

258
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:39,336
And then, among the fishes,
a whale.

259
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,340
<i>Lying at the bottom of</i>
<i>the Indian ocean.</i>

260
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,509
Emerald City.

261
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,444
<i>Beautiful.</i>

262
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:49,012
<i>Now, rocky is radioactive,</i>

263
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:52,115
but what he needs from you
is an import license.

264
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:54,852
And why would we want to
weaponize this material?

265
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:56,019
<i>As a deterrent.</i>

266
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,521
A silver bullet
to keep in reserve,

267
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:58,789
to use against the Kryptonians,

268
00:30:58,791 --> 00:31:00,691
so the day does not come,
madam,

269
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,492
when your children are waving
daisies at a reviewing stand.

270
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,194
Last I looked,
the only one of those

271
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,829
flying around up here
was superman.

272
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:09,032
Ha-ha, yes. Superman.
Yeah, but there are...

273
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,467
<i>There are more of them.</i>

274
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:11,835
The metahuman thesis.

275
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:13,237
<i>Yes, the metahuman thesis.</i>

276
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:14,638
<i>More likely than not</i>

277
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,740
these exceptional beings
live among us.

278
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:19,543
The basis of our myths.
Gods among men upon

279
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:21,044
our little blue planet here.

280
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,182
Now, you don't have to use
a silver bullet.

281
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,718
But if you forge one...

282
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,419
Well, then

283
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:32,089
we don't have to depend
upon the kindness of monsters.

284
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:39,830
There are ways
we can help each other.

285
00:31:39,832 --> 00:31:42,065
Would you step
into my office here?

286
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,704
Yes.

287
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:49,473
What's your wish list?

288
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:56,113
Access to the wreck of
the crashed Kryptonian ship?

289
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,449
Done.

290
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:51,268
The complete remains of the
dead alien for testing.

291
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:54,204
You want Zod's body?

292
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,873
Okay.

293
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,244
It's cherry.

294
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,152
<i>Because the time has come</i>

295
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:45,455
<i>for the world to hear</i>
<i>the other side of the story.</i>

296
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:48,692

Okay, but whose hero?</i>

297
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,994
<i>If superman</i>
<i>were here right now,</i>

298
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:53,130

299
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:55,532
<i>That my family,</i>

00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:03,874
<i>which lives count.</i>

303
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:06,410
<i>And which ones do not.</i>

304
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,014
Sir, get down.

305
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,985

306
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:25,455
<i>Now!</i>

307
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,023
<i>Can we get some backup here?</i>

308
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,926

328
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,541

<i>Metropolis news 8.</i>

330
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:21,278
Jenny.

Is she in?

335
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:13,597
No, she's been gone.

336
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,899
<i>What'd she do, officer?</i>

337
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:18,101
I'm not a cop.

338
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:19,436
I'm a reporter.

339
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,240
The young lady living here...

340
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:25,175
She hasn't been back.

341
00:37:25,177 --> 00:37:26,910
In fact, if she's smart, then
she's got out of this city.

342
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,013
And you need to get out
of here before dark.

343
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:31,514
Unless you want to
run into him.

<i>Don't listen to that nonsense.</i>

345
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:36,920
Only people scared of him,
people who got reason to be.

346
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,755
Scared of who?

347
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:41,124
There's a new kind of
mean in him.

348
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,526
He is angry.

349
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:46,529
And he's hunting.

350
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:51,935
<i>Show 'em what you got!</i>

351

00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,341
Throw a punch, will ya?

353
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,145
Let's go! Come on!

354
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,536
Thank you.

355
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,814
The house treats
luck like an insult.

356
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,650
Good luck for one is always
his brother's misfortune.

357
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,823
Three nights with
a bolshoi ballerina,

358
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,591
that line was
all she taught me.

359
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:51,594
Not all, I'm sure.
Good evening.

360
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,002
<i>It's like a one-man</i>
<i>reign of terror.</i>

361
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:02,839
This bat vigilante has been
consistently targeting the port

362
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,841
and the adjacent projects
and tenements.

363
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,843
And, as far as I can tell, the
cops are actually helping him.

364
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,813
"Crime wave in Gotham."

365
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:13,016
"Water, wet."

366
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,617
Did you file the football yet?

367
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,519
Why aren't we covering this?

368
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,521
<i>Poor people don't buy papers?</i>

369
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,657
People don't buy papers,
period, Kent.

370
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:22,058
Perry, when you assign a story,

371
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,827
you're making a choice
about who matters.

372
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:25,195
And who's worth it.

373
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:26,996
Good morning, Smallville.

374
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:30,667
The American conscience died
with Robert, Martin, and John.

375
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:33,837
<i>Sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

376
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,940
No match. My guys in the crime
lab never seen one before.

377
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,410
It's called a bullet.
You shoot people with them.

378
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:41,911
Recovered from the scene

379
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:43,580
of the firefight in the desert.

380
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:45,882
Not sold anywhere
commercially in the world,

381
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,083
even black market.

382
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:48,485
<i>So?</i>

383
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:50,387
So who gave
prototype military rounds

384
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:51,855
to tuareg fighters
in the Sahara?

385
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,490
You're the reporter. Tell me.

386
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:55,258
I think that the us government
is arming the rebels

387
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,893
<i>while claiming to support</i>
<i>the elected government.</i>

388
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,561
The ask, Lois.

389
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,268
Flight to D.C. tonight.
Couple of days there.

390
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:06,836
Go.

391
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:09,172
Coach. No extra legroom.

392
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,009
Economy plus.

393
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:14,277
Coach!

394
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,914
So, why didn't you tell me?

395
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,185
You're digging up snakes, lo.

396
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,188
It's kind of dangerous.

397
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,123
That is why I didn't tell you.

398
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,525
Lane, don't you
have a plane to catch?

399
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,660
Yes, sir.

400
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,731
Benefit for
the library of Metropolis.

401
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:37,767
Someone on the committee requested
that Clark Kent cover it.

402
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:41,004
Probably some old charity crone
who's got a thing for nerds.

403
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,782
<i>Senator.</i>

404
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,452
Little bourbon before lunch?

405
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:57,587
My driver's outside.
I can't stay.

406
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:59,456
No bourbon?

407
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:00,957
Kentucky girl like yourself?

408
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:06,329
My dad always said
that Kentucky mash

409
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:08,298
was the secret to health.

410
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,402
This was his room.

411
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,172
I kept it just the same.

412
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:25,815
"Maybe one day dad'll come back if
I just keep everything the same."

413
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,383
That is silly.

414
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,488
The magical thinking
of orphan boys.

415
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:34,224
I'm blocking the import
license for your mineral.

416
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,933
The redcapes are coming.

417
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:47,604
The redcapes are coming.

418
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,209
You and your hearings.

419
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:59,749
Galloping through
the streets to warn us.

420
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:02,886
One if by land,

421
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:04,888
two if by air.

422
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:14,030
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, senator?

423
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,231
Can I call you June?

424
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:18,034
You can call me
whatever you like.

425
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:20,737
Take a bucket of piss and
call it granny's peach tea.

426
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:23,740
Take a weapon of assassination

427
00:42:23,742 --> 00:42:25,441
and call it deterrence.

428
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,212
You won't fool a fly or me.

429
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:32,782
I'm not gonna drink it.

430
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:39,822
You don't think
dad would mind, do you?

431
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:44,761
If I changed just...
Just one thing in this room?

432
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,599
Because that
should be upside-down.

433
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,836
We know better now, don't we?

434
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:56,973
The devils don't come
from hell beneath us. No.

435
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:00,109
No, they come from the sky.

436
00:44:57,729 --> 00:44:59,562
I hope the next generation
of waynes

437
00:44:59,564 --> 00:45:03,466
won't inherit
an empty wine cellar.

438
00:45:03,468 --> 00:45:06,602
Not that there's likely
to be a next generation.

439
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,138
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

440
00:45:12,177 --> 00:45:15,745
This is every call made
from the Russian's phone.

441
00:45:15,747 --> 00:45:18,214
Two mentions of business
with the white Portuguese.

442
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:21,150
And it's continually
transmitting blacked-out data

443
00:45:21,152 --> 00:45:22,819
to the personal residence

444
00:45:22,821 --> 00:45:24,487
of Alexander Luthor.

445
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:28,357
You think Lex Luthor
is the white Portuguese?

446
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:32,361
I can't see that he needs the
income from imported arms.

447
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:34,397
Regardless, I'll need to put
a leech at his house,

448
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:35,732
and I'm gonna need the suit.

449
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,834
The bat interrogated six people

450
00:45:37,836 --> 00:45:39,836
and came away with nothing.

451
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:43,906
It was Bruce Wayne
that got the information.

452
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:47,076
Well, Bruce Wayne can't
break into Lex Luthor's house.

453
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:48,811
Bruce Wayne won't have to.

454
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:52,081
He's been invited.

455
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:07,490
Who's that?

456
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:09,926
You must be new to
the "let them eat cake" beat.

457
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:12,695
That is Bruce Wayne.

458
00:47:12,697 --> 00:47:14,931
<i>Philanthropist, bibliophile...</i>

459
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:18,134
True friend of
the library of Metropolis.

460
00:47:18,136 --> 00:47:19,535
Mr. Lex Luthor.

461
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:22,238
Me? Okay.

462
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:29,111
Nicky.

463
00:47:29,113 --> 00:47:31,347
<i>You're embarrassing me. Um...</i>

464
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,382
<i>Speech, speech.</i>

465
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,486
<i>Open bar.</i>

466
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:39,488
<i>The end.</i>

467
00:47:42,227 --> 00:47:45,228
The word "philanthropist"
comes from the Greek.

468
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,829
Meaning a lover of humanity.

469
00:47:46,831 --> 00:47:49,899
<i>It was coined</i>
<i>about 2,500 years ago.</i>

470
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:51,667
All right.
Where am I going, Alfred?

471
00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:53,836
Go past the elevator.

472
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:55,371
Do a left.

473
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:58,541
<i>That's right, must be.</i>

474
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:00,877
<i>It's in the service corridor</i>
<i>in the basement.</i>

475
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:02,345
<i>Go down the stairs.</i>

476
00:48:02,347 --> 00:48:04,647
<i>Gods and men.</i>
<i>Prometheus went with us.</i>

477
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:07,383
And he ruined Zeus' plan
to destroy mankind,

478
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:08,851
and for that he was
given a thunderbolt.

479
00:48:09,988 --> 00:48:12,221
<i>That seems unfair.</i>

480
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:15,224
<i>Um... on a serious note,</i>
<i>the library of Metropolis...</i>

481
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:17,159
Go to the stairs. You saw them on your way in.
Down the stairs.

482
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:20,897
<i>But at one time,</i>
<i>dad could not buy them. No.</i>

483
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:23,032
<i>My father could not afford</i>
<i>books growing up.</i>

484
00:48:23,034 --> 00:48:24,600
<i>He had to root through the garbage
for yesterday's newspaper.</i>

485
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:28,604
All right. You got
the kitchens on your right.

486
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,540
<i>Do a left.</i>

487
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:33,776
Right in front of you.
That's where you want to be.

488
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,928
May I help you, Mr. Wayne?

489
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:54,297
I just...

490
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:57,066
I thought the bathroom was
down here. I must have...

491
00:48:57,068 --> 00:49:00,770
That last Martini was
two too many, I think.

492
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:02,238
Men's room is upstairs.

493
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,839
Great. I'm okay.

494
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,008
I like those shoes.

495
00:49:10,882 --> 00:49:12,782
I can't stay down here, Alfred.

496
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:14,250
<i>Go upstairs and socialize.</i>

497
00:49:14,252 --> 00:49:15,952
Some young lady from Metropolis

498
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:17,286
will make you honest.

499
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,324
In your dreams, Alfred.

500
00:49:21,326 --> 00:49:22,825
<i>Books are knowledge,</i>

501
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:26,395
and knowledge is power,
and I am...

502
00:49:26,397 --> 00:49:27,997
No.

503
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:31,000
No. What am I? I...
What was I saying? No.

504
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,737
The bittersweet pain among men

505
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:38,607
is having knowledge with
no power, because...

506
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:41,544
Because that is paradoxical!
And, um...

507
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,982
Thank you for coming.

508
00:49:47,418 --> 00:49:49,018
<i>Please drink. Drink.</i>

509
00:49:57,861 --> 00:50:02,164
Mr. Wayne? Mr. Wayne?
Clark Kent, <i> daily planet.</i>

510
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:04,266
My foundation has
already issued a statement

511
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:06,335
in support of books.

512
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,504
Sir?

513
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:11,207
Wow. Pretty girl. Bad habit.
Don't quote me.

514
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:12,875
All right?

515
00:50:12,877 --> 00:50:15,845
What's your position on
the bat vigilante in Gotham?

516
00:50:15,847 --> 00:50:18,547
<i>Daily planet.</i> Do I own this one?
Or is that the other guy?

517
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:22,151
Civil liberties are being
trampled on in your city.

518
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:23,519
Good people are living in fear.

519
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:28,491
Don't believe everything
you hear, son.

520
00:50:28,493 --> 00:50:31,861
I've seen it, Mr. Wayne.
He thinks he's above the law.

521
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:38,234
<i>The daily planet</i> criticizing those
who think they're above the law

522
00:50:38,236 --> 00:50:42,405
is a little hypocritical,
wouldn't you say?

523
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:45,174
Considering every time your
hero saves a cat out of a tree,

524
00:50:45,176 --> 00:50:47,476
you write
a puff piece editorial

525
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:50,212
about an alien who,
if he wanted to,

526
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:52,982
could burn
the whole place down.

527
00:50:52,984 --> 00:50:55,818
There wouldn't be a damn thing
we could do to stop him.

528
00:50:57,854 --> 00:51:00,890
Most of the world doesn't
share your opinion, Mr. Wayne.

529
00:51:00,892 --> 00:51:04,360
Maybe it's
the Gotham city in me.

530
00:51:04,362 --> 00:51:05,828
We just have a bad history

531
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:07,596
with freaks
dressed like clowns.

532
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,100
<i>Boys!</i>

533
00:51:11,102 --> 00:51:13,702
Bruce Wayne meets
Clark Kent. Ha!

534
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,704
I love it. I love bringing
people together.

535
00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:16,739
How are we?

536
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:18,507
Lex. Hello. Good.

537
00:51:18,509 --> 00:51:21,010
Hi, hello, Lex,
it is a pleasure.

538
00:51:21,012 --> 00:51:22,611
Wow! That is a good grip!

539
00:51:22,613 --> 00:51:25,414
You should not pick a fight
with this person.

540
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,716
So, after all these years, we
finally got you over to Metropolis.

541
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:29,885
Well, I thought
I'd come drink you dry.

542
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:31,887
Well, you're welcome. You should
hop the harbor more often, though.

543
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:33,222
I'd love to show you my labs.

544
00:51:33,224 --> 00:51:35,691
Maybe we could
partner on something.

545
00:51:35,693 --> 00:51:38,594
My r and d is up to
all sorts of no good.

546
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,966
That's seven minutes.

547
00:51:43,968 --> 00:51:45,267
<i>Looks like</i>
<i>the transfer's complete.</i>

548
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:47,770
Mr. Luthor. Yes?

549
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:49,605
The governor. Governor.

550
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,107
Excuse me. Next time.

551
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:52,441
Governor! Hi!

552
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:54,143
Lex, it's good to see you.

553
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:33,482
Excuse me.

554
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:42,218
<i>We, as a population</i>
<i>on this planet,</i>

555
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:43,719
<i>have been looking for a savior.</i>

556
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:46,155
<i>90% of people believe</i>
<i>in a higher power,</i>

557
00:53:46,157 --> 00:53:47,590
<i>and every religion believes</i>

558

<i>in some sort of</i>
<i>messianic figure.</i>

559

<i>And when this savior character</i>
<i>actually comes to earth,</i>

560
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,064
<i>we want to make him abide</i>
<i>by our rules?</i>

561
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:57,199
<i>We have to understand that</i>
<i>this a paradigm shift.</i>

562
00:53:57,201 --> 00:53:59,735
<i>We have to start thinking</i>
<i>beyond politics.</i>

563
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:02,404
<i>Are there any moral
constraints on this person?</i>

564
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:04,406
<i>We have international law.</i>

565
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:07,576
<i>On this earth,</i>
<i>every act is a political act.</i>

566
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:09,411
<i>Is it really surprising</i>

567
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:11,780
<i>that the most powerful man</i>
<i>in the world</i>

568
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:14,950
<i>should be</i>
<i>a figure of controversy?</i>

569
00:54:14,952 --> 00:54:17,519
<i>To have an individual engaging</i>

<i>in these state-level</i>
<i>interventions</i>

571
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:22,057
<i>should give us all pause.</i>

572
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:24,293
<i>Human beings</i>
<i>have a horrible track record</i>

573
00:54:24,295 --> 00:54:26,562
<i>of following people</i>
<i>with great power</i>

574
00:54:26,564 --> 00:54:28,264
<i>down paths that led to</i>

575
00:54:28,266 --> 00:54:30,266
<i>huge human atrocities.</i>

576
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:32,801
<i>We have always created
icons in our own image.</i>

577
00:54:32,803 --> 00:54:36,272
<i>What we've done is we
project ourselves onto him.</i>

578
00:54:36,274 --> 00:54:39,975
<i>The fact is, maybe he's not some
sort of devil or Jesus character.</i>

579
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:42,444
<i>Maybe he's just a guy</i>
<i>trying to do the right thing.</i>

580
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:45,614
<i>We're talking about a being</i>
<i>whose very existence</i>

581
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:50,152
<i>challenges our own sense of
priority in the universe.</i>

582
00:54:50,154 --> 00:54:51,620
<i>And you go back to copernicus,</i>

583
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,122
<i>where he restored the sun</i>

584
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:54,623
<i>in the center of</i>
<i>the known universe,</i>

585

<i>displacing earth.</i>

586
00:54:56,127 --> 00:54:57,960
<i>And you get to</i>
<i>darwinian evolution,</i>

587
00:54:57,962 --> 00:55:00,129
<i>and you find out we're not</i>

588
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:02,965
<i>we're just one among</i>
<i>other lifeforms.</i>

589
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,833
<i>And now we learn</i>
<i>that we're not even</i>

590
00:55:04,835 --> 00:55:06,302
<i>special in the entire universe</i>

591
00:55:06,304 --> 00:55:09,171
<i>because there is superman.</i>

592
00:55:09,173 --> 00:55:12,841
<i>There he is. An alien among us.</i>

593
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:14,943
<i>We're not alone.</i>

594
00:55:14,945 --> 00:55:17,146
<i>Are you,</i>
<i>as a United States senator,</i>

595
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:21,583
<i>personally comfortable saying</i>

<i>"superman could have</i>

<i>"but on principle,</i>

<i>I'm not saying</i>
<i>he shouldn't act.</i>

599
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:33,262
<i>I'm saying he shouldn't</i>
<i>act unilaterally.</i>

600
00:55:33,264 --> 00:55:35,497
<i>What are we</i>

601
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:38,200
<i>Must there be a superman?</i>

602
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:41,570
<i>There is.</i>

603
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:55,651
<i>Hello?</i>

<i>Mom?</i>

00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:58,253
Clark!

606
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,656
What is it?

607
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:01,890
What's wrong?

608
00:56:01,892 --> 00:56:04,126
<i>No. Nothing. I just...</i>

609
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:08,297
Hi.

610
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,767
Hi.

611
00:56:14,237 --> 00:56:16,105
How come dad never left Kansas?

612
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,044
Well, he just...

613
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:24,546
You know how he was.

614
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:26,548
"What do I need to travel for?"

615
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,117
"I'm already there."

616
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,121
Just wish it was more simple.

617
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,225
My baby boy.

618
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,462
Nothing was ever simple.

619
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:49,438
An odd little duck.

620
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,309
I've never seen
a metal like this.

621
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:59,214
Could be darpa black box.

622
00:56:59,216 --> 00:57:00,883
Who could find out?

623
00:57:00,885 --> 00:57:02,851
Nobody who'd want to.

624
00:57:02,853 --> 00:57:05,721
Maybe they gave them out to the
rebels to test in theater.

625
00:57:05,723 --> 00:57:08,924
Using live soldiers
as Guinea pigs?

626
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:11,794
This is what makes you
such a good reporter.

627
00:57:11,796 --> 00:57:13,095
Stuff like this
still shocks you.

628
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,119
It don't come off!

629
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,221
It don't come off!

630
00:57:39,223 --> 00:57:41,457
Prisoner transfer!

631
00:57:41,459 --> 00:57:43,725
You can't put me in general, man.
They gonna kill me.

632
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:45,327
Hey, you can't bring me
to general.

633
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:46,628
You should be thanking
the tax payers of Metropolis

634
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,397
for taking in your branded ass.

635
00:57:48,399 --> 00:57:49,998
Sign here, please.
I'm marked, man.

636
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,633
You know what they do
to people with this on them?

637
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,168
He's only a criminal.

638
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:54,670
This way! Let's go!
They're gonna kill me!

639
00:57:54,672 --> 00:57:55,971
- <i>They're gonna kill me!</i>
- Let's go!

640
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:57,072
Keefe.

641
00:57:57,074 --> 00:57:58,807
You made bail.

642
00:57:58,809 --> 00:57:59,875
Open two.

643
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:06,849
Who paid?

644
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,329
Who the hell are you?

645
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,202
Just a man.

646
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:29,404
Yeah? Well, what the fuck
do you want?

647
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:35,677
To help you
stand for something.

648
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:42,618
Your three o'clock's here.

649
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:55,264
He made me half a man.

650
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,901
My wife

651
00:58:58,903 --> 00:59:01,103
walked out on me.

652
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:06,275
I can't even piss standing up.

653
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,944
<i>Let me face him.</i>

654
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,414
You'll take care of it?

655
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:15,284
Good.

656
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:41,977
What?

657
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,431
Wrong room, miss.

658
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:03,899
Secretary swanwick,

659
01:00:03,901 --> 01:00:05,367
you haven't been
returning my phone calls.

660
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:09,438
Miss Lane, if you'd
like an interview,

661
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,074
major farris is
just outside that door.

662
01:00:12,076 --> 01:00:13,976
You're treating me
like a stranger?

663
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:17,446
I'm treating you
like a reporter.

664
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:21,216
All right. Is the us providing
experimental military arms

665
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:23,051
to rebels in Africa?

666
01:00:23,053 --> 01:00:25,621
You know,
with balls like yours,

667
01:00:25,623 --> 01:00:27,556
you belong in here.

668
01:00:27,558 --> 01:00:30,759
What's your source on this?
A tin foil hat?

669
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:32,794
No, not tin. But it's metal.

670
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:34,630
Fired in the superman incident.

671
01:00:34,632 --> 01:00:37,065
Experts at
the Pentagon can't ID it.

672
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:38,300
We haven't been told the truth.

673
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:39,601
Here's the truth.

674
01:00:39,603 --> 01:00:41,069
A reporter got greedy
for a scoop

675
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:42,471
and went where
she shouldn't have.

676
01:00:42,473 --> 01:00:44,640
Superman acted like
some rogue combatant

677
01:00:44,642 --> 01:00:47,309
to rescue her, and people died.

678
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:50,045
Don't invent a conspiracy
theory to put back his halo.

679
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,481
Or yours.

680
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,983
- Major.
- <i>Sir.</i>

681
01:00:56,185 --> 01:00:57,619
<i>So.</i>

682
01:00:57,621 --> 01:01:00,155
I logged into your dropbox
to find copy.

683
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:02,524
There's copy all right.

684
01:01:02,526 --> 01:01:06,461
But nothing about football.
Nothing about,

685
01:01:06,463 --> 01:01:09,765
the friends of
the Metropolis library,

686
01:01:09,767 --> 01:01:12,668
just the goddamn
Gotham bat thing

687
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,703
I told you not to pursue.

688
01:01:14,705 --> 01:01:16,705
If the police won't help, the
press has to do the right thing.

689
01:01:16,707 --> 01:01:18,607
You don't get to decide
what the right thing is.

690
01:01:18,609 --> 01:01:21,009
When the <i> planet</i> was founded,
it stood for something, Perry.

691
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:24,846
And so could you if it was
1938, but it's not 1938.

692
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:28,116
Wpa ain't hiring no more.
Apples don't cost a nickel.

693
01:01:28,118 --> 01:01:31,119
Not in here, not out there.
You drop this thing!

694
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,425
Nobody cares about Clark Kent
taking on the Batman.

695
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,462
<i>So apparently superman</i>

696
01:01:40,464 --> 01:01:42,831
<i>doesn't want us to think of
him as American anymore.</i>

697
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:44,232
<i>And really, why would we?</i>

698
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:46,168
<i>Aside from the</i>
<i>red and blue costume.</i>

699
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:47,969
<i>And, I don't know,</i>
<i>the fact that he has</i>

700
01:01:47,971 --> 01:01:50,472
<i>one-third of the usa's</i>
<i>initials on his chest.</i>

701
01:01:50,474 --> 01:01:52,074
<i>I assume the only reason</i>
<i>he's not wearing</i>

702
01:01:52,076 --> 01:01:55,043
<i>the declaration of</i>
<i>independence as a cape is...</i>

703
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:56,678
<i>He thinks it's too on-the-nose.</i>

704
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,647
<i>What is going on back here?</i> No.

705
01:01:58,649 --> 01:02:00,182
Guys, come on. Let's go.

706
01:02:00,184 --> 01:02:01,650
<i>Get yourselves together</i>
<i>and get out there.</i>

707
01:02:01,652 --> 01:02:03,051
<i>Get those glasses</i>
<i>on those trays.</i>

708
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:03,919
<i>We got thirsty people</i>
<i>out there.</i>

709
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:14,896
I wonder, would you excuse us?

710
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:17,733
There's something I'd like to show you.
I'm sorry.

711
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:21,036
Now some scholars insist
that it never happened...

712
01:02:21,038 --> 01:02:23,038
But I believe it's the action

713
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:27,909
perfectly in keeping with a king who
was also a psychopathic killer.

714
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:31,680
For me, it's the culmination
of 40 years curating.

715
01:02:31,682 --> 01:02:34,683
And I can't believe it,
but I've finally got it here.

716
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:38,019
It's the sword of Alexander.

717
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:42,324
It's the blade that
cut the gordian knot.

718
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:46,228
It's a triumph.

719
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,696
Yes.

720
01:02:47,698 --> 01:02:49,097
- <i>Enjoy.</i>
- <i>Thank you.</i>

721
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,473
It's a fake.

722
01:02:58,475 --> 01:03:01,276
The real one was sold
in '98 on the black market.

723
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:02,444
And now it hangs...

724
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:04,780
Over the bed of
the sultan of hajar.

725
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:09,684
Excuse me.

726
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,721
Excuse me, miss.

727
01:03:12,723 --> 01:03:15,957
The other night you took something
that doesn't belong to you.

728
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:18,126
Stealing's not polite.

729
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:20,796
Is it stealing if you steal
from another thief?

730
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,266
Who are you?

731
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:26,835
Someone interested
in the same man you are.

732
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:29,771
Is that right?

733
01:03:29,773 --> 01:03:32,841
I believe Mr. Luthor has a
photograph that belongs to me.

734
01:03:32,843 --> 01:03:34,342
Did you get it?

735
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:36,845
As it happens, no, I didn't.

736
01:03:36,847 --> 01:03:39,981
The data you copied has
military-grade encryption.

737
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:43,518
You know,
I bet with that dress,

738
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,454
9 out of 10 men will let you
get away with anything.

739
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:47,956
But you're the 10th?

740
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:50,358
I'm guessing I'm the first

741
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,727
to see through that
babe-in-the-woods act.

742
01:03:53,796 --> 01:03:55,463
You don't know me,

743
01:03:55,465 --> 01:03:57,098
but I've known
a few women like you.

744
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:03,538
I don't think you've ever
known a woman like me.

745
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:08,310
You know, it's true what
they say about little boys.

746
01:04:08,312 --> 01:04:11,079
Born with no natural
inclination to share.

747
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:14,516
I didn't steal your drive.

748
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:16,785
I borrowed it.

749
01:04:16,787 --> 01:04:19,754
You'll find it in the glove
compartment of your car.

750
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:22,090
Mr. Wayne.

751
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:16,471
Did you get it?

752
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:17,806
The rock?

753
01:06:17,808 --> 01:06:19,140
Yeah, we got it.

754
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:46,034
I'm sorry.

755
01:06:47,704 --> 01:06:50,705
Get down! Get down now!

756
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:07,622
No!

757
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,505
She was my world.

758
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,041
And you took her from me.

759
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:19,521
<i>Bruce!</i>

760
01:09:19,523 --> 01:09:22,590
Bruce! Listen to me now!

761
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:27,996
It's Lois!

762
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:29,931
It's Lois Lane!

763
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:32,200
<i>She's the key!</i>

764
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:36,604
Am I too soon?

765
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:40,508
I'm too soon!

766
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,844
<i>You're right about him!</i>

767
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:45,680
<i>You've always</i>
<i>been right about him!</i>

768
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:48,049
Fear him! Fear him!

769
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:49,951
Find us, Bruce!

770
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,620
<i>You have to find us!</i>

771
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,020
<i>The</i> white Portuguese
<i>is not a man.</i>

772
01:10:59,022 --> 01:11:00,121
<i>It's a ship.</i>

773
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:06,027
Master Wayne,
since the age of seven

774
01:11:06,029 --> 01:11:08,096
you have been
to the art of deception

775
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:10,698
as Mozart to the harpsichord.

776
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:14,469
But you've never been
too hot at lying to me.

777
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:19,374
The <i> white Portuguese</i> is not
carrying a dirty bomb.

778
01:11:19,376 --> 01:11:21,009
<i>What is it carrying?</i>

779
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:23,544
It's a weapon.

780
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,114
It's a rock.

781
01:11:26,116 --> 01:11:29,717
A mineral capable of weakening
Kryptonian cells.

782
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:31,452
<i>The first sample big enough</i>
<i>to mean something</i>

783
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:33,488
turned up in the Indian ocean
three months ago.

784
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:35,456
It is now aboard
the <i> white Portuguese</i>

785
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,959
being delivered to Lex Luthor.

786
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:39,994
Who I am going
to steal it from.

787
01:11:39,996 --> 01:11:41,929
To keep it out
of Luthor's hands.

788
01:11:41,931 --> 01:11:43,197
To destroy it.

789
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:45,700
No.

790
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:50,905
You're gonna go to war?

791
01:11:50,907 --> 01:11:56,911
That son of a bitch brought
the war to us two years ago.

792
01:11:56,913 --> 01:12:00,515
Jesus, Alfred. Count the dead.
Thousands of people.

793
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:04,619
What's next? Millions?

794
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:07,288
He has the power to wipe out
the entire human race,

795
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:09,857
and if we believe there's even a
1% chance that he is our enemy,

796
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:13,027
we have to take it
as an absolute certainty.

797
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:14,429
And we have to destroy him.

798
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:17,098
But he is not our enemy.

799
01:12:17,933 --> 01:12:19,967
Not today.

800
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:22,670
20 years in Gotham, Alfred.

801
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:24,605
We've seen
what promises are worth.

802
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:27,442
How many good guys are left.

803
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:30,511
How many stayed that way.

804
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:34,949
14 hours.

805
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:40,054
My name is Clark Kent.
I'm from the <i> daily planet.</i>

806
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:48,029
I'm trying to find out what
happened to an inmate, a Santos.

807
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:49,597
I can't give out
that information.

808
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,549
Mommy!

809
01:13:12,488 --> 01:13:14,889
Mrs. Santos?

810
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:17,358
<i>May I ask you a few questions?</i>

811
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,160
He wasn't my husband.

812
01:13:19,162 --> 01:13:20,561
But I know what he did.

813
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:23,865
But he was a father.

814
01:13:23,867 --> 01:13:25,833
He was that, too.

815
01:13:25,835 --> 01:13:27,435
They took him
out of Gotham central.

816
01:13:27,437 --> 01:13:29,670
They moved him to Metropolis.

817
01:13:29,672 --> 01:13:31,572
But inside they know.

818
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:34,075
They know the mark all over.
Guards don't care.

819
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:35,476
Bat's the judge.

820
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:38,246
One man decides who lives.

821
01:13:38,248 --> 01:13:40,748
How is that justice?
Talk to me.

822
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,785
Help me change it.
With what? Your pen?

823
01:13:43,787 --> 01:13:46,721
A man like that,
words don't stop him.

824
01:13:46,723 --> 01:13:48,189
You know stops him?

825
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:50,124
A fist.

826
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,363
<i>Kent, I want to talk to you.</i>

827
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,434
Kent!

828
01:13:59,436 --> 01:14:01,602
Where does he go?
Where does he go, Jenny?

829
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:03,604
I don't... I don't know.

830
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:04,806
Clicks his heels three times,

831
01:14:04,808 --> 01:14:06,507
goes back to Kansas, I suppose.

832
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:09,577
Son of a...

833
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:22,824
<i>Turn it!</i>

834
01:14:22,826 --> 01:14:24,358
<i>Turn it!</i>

835
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:09,237
Move out!

836
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:46,307
Go, go, go, go!

837
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:26,414
No!

838
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:52,867
Where is he?

839
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:15,449
Next time they shine
your light in the sky,

840
01:19:15,451 --> 01:19:17,284
don't go to it.

841
01:19:17,286 --> 01:19:19,687
The bat is dead. Bury it.

842
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:22,590
Consider this mercy.

843
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:26,193
<i>Tell me.</i>

844
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,133
<i>Do you bleed?</i>

845
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,109
<i>You will.</i>

846
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:27,214
I don't have a halo over me,
Mr. secretary.

847
01:21:27,216 --> 01:21:29,250
I went into the desert,
people died.

848
01:21:29,252 --> 01:21:31,385
It keeps me awake. It should.

849
01:21:37,192 --> 01:21:38,893
If you think that superman
is a murderer,

850
01:21:38,895 --> 01:21:40,895
then throw it away.

851
01:21:40,897 --> 01:21:42,796
But I don't believe
you think that.

852
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:48,903
<i>How do we determine</i>
<i>what's good?</i>

853
01:21:48,905 --> 01:21:51,739
In a democracy,
good is a conversation,

854
01:21:51,741 --> 01:21:54,608
<i>not a unilateral decision.</i>

855
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:57,278
So I urge superman to come

856
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,079
<i>to this hill of the people</i>
<i>tomorrow</i>

857
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:01,782
<i>to see those who have suffered.</i>

858
01:22:01,784 --> 01:22:05,052
<i>The world needs to know</i>
<i>what happened in that desert.</i>

859
01:22:05,054 --> 01:22:07,554
<i>And to know what he stands for.</i>

860
01:22:07,556 --> 01:22:09,757
<i>How far will he take his power?</i>

861
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:15,162
<i>Does he act by our will</i>
<i>or by his own?</i>

862
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:25,839
<i>People hate</i>
<i>what they don't understand.</i>

863
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:31,111
But they see what you do,
and they know who you are.

864
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:35,950
You're not a killer, a threat.

865
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:39,687
I never wanted this world
to have you.

866
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:46,493
Be their hero, Clark.
Be their monument.

867
01:22:46,495 --> 01:22:48,495
Be their angel.

868
01:22:48,497 --> 01:22:50,364
Be anything
they need you to be.

869
01:22:51,099 --> 01:22:52,800
Or be none of it.

870
01:22:54,769 --> 01:22:56,804
You don't owe
this world a thing.

871
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,640
You never did.

872
01:23:02,077 --> 01:23:05,346
<i>This is deniros. Transfer
available to Kane Avenue.</i>

873
01:23:05,348 --> 01:23:06,814
<i>Please, mind your step.</i>

874
01:23:36,811 --> 01:23:39,113
<i>I have to speak</i>
<i>to the senator today.</i>

875
01:23:39,115 --> 01:23:40,681
<i>You cannot</i>
<i>see the senator today.</i>

876
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:42,182
<i>I need to speak to her</i>
<i>before the hearing.</i>

877
01:23:42,184 --> 01:23:44,118
<i>Do you understand</i>
<i>how important this is?</i>

878
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,652
<i>I cannot</i>
<i>let you see the senator.</i>

879
01:23:45,654 --> 01:23:47,454
<i>Please, I need to speak to her.</i>

880
01:23:47,456 --> 01:23:50,357
<i>Please, madam. I beg of you!</i>
<i>Please don't do this!</i>

881
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:51,859
<i>This is so important!</i>

882
01:23:51,861 --> 01:23:54,395
<i>Come with me. Don't touch me!</i>

883
01:23:54,397 --> 01:23:56,597
Please! I'm sorry.
She wouldn't leave.

884
01:23:58,366 --> 01:24:01,168
I didn't tell you the truth.

885
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:04,071
C.I. Thinks
the desert was a setup.

886
01:24:04,073 --> 01:24:06,240
Somebody wanted superman
to look guilty.

887
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:09,043
The bullet?

888
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:18,886
The metal was developed
by a private company.

889
01:24:18,888 --> 01:24:20,187
What company?

890
01:24:20,189 --> 01:24:21,789
Lexcorp.

891
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:24,725
Lex Luthor?

892
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:27,094
He also had private security
contractors at the desert compound.

893
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:33,033
Go on record.

894
01:24:33,035 --> 01:24:36,737
Not a chance. It's classified.

895
01:24:36,739 --> 01:24:37,938
I happen to like my job.

896
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:39,706
It doesn't make sense.

897
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:41,775
You said that the ambush was
arranged to frame superman,

898
01:24:41,777 --> 01:24:44,111
but how could they know
that he'd show up in the...

899
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:52,953
In the middle of the desert.
Thank you.

900
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:59,860
The senate hearing is expected
to get underway any minute now.

901
01:24:59,862 --> 01:25:02,096
And of course the big
unknown in all of this is

902
01:25:02,098 --> 01:25:03,597
will superman show up?

903
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:04,598
That is what they're really
waiting to see.

904
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,899
Mr. keefe. Mr. keefe.

905
01:25:05,901 --> 01:25:07,434
Soledad o'brien, <i>in the moment.</i>

906
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:08,936
Quick question for you.

907
01:25:08,938 --> 01:25:10,304
You're heading in
to meet with the senators.

908
01:25:10,306 --> 01:25:12,106
What will you tell them?

909
01:25:12,108 --> 01:25:15,042
<i>I've come here</i>
<i>to tell them to wake up.</i>

910
01:25:15,044 --> 01:25:17,211
<i>This is flesh and blood.</i>

911
01:25:17,213 --> 01:25:18,645
<i>He has delivered a war here.</i>

912
01:25:18,647 --> 01:25:20,881
<i>And this...</i>

913
01:25:20,883 --> 01:25:22,249
<i>This is what war looks like.</i>

914
01:25:22,251 --> 01:25:24,418
<i>I have nothing.</i>

915
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:26,787
<i>There are plenty of people, sir,
who would say he's their hero.</i>

916
01:25:26,789 --> 01:25:28,455
<i>He is not a hero.</i>

917
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:31,458
Grace, can you get
Greg up here, please?

918
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,660
Right now.

919
01:25:33,662 --> 01:25:35,729
An anonymous source
can verify everything

920
01:25:35,731 --> 01:25:37,464
I told you about what
happened in nairomi.

921
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:40,100
An anonymous source? <i>Run it.</i>

922
01:25:40,102 --> 01:25:42,236
Luthor engineered the desert.

923
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:44,404
It was an ambush for superman.

924
01:25:44,406 --> 01:25:45,973
Trust your reporter.
Think Watergate.

925
01:25:45,975 --> 01:25:48,108
<i>Yeah, and you need to</i>
<i>think litigate.</i>

926
01:25:48,110 --> 01:25:50,644
<i>If you're wrong, Luthor will sue
the paper out of existence.</i>

927
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:51,812
<i>You need proof.</i>

928
01:25:51,814 --> 01:25:53,347
No. It needs to run now.

929
01:25:53,349 --> 01:25:55,015
<i>Before the hearing.</i>

930
01:25:55,017 --> 01:25:56,517
<i>If superman knows,</i>
<i>it might change what he says.</i>

931
01:25:56,519 --> 01:25:58,785
I am not going to
risk the paper

932
01:25:58,787 --> 01:26:00,487
so that you can
pass notes in class

933
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:01,755
to the man that rescued you.

934
01:26:01,757 --> 01:26:03,323
<i>He paid her?</i>

935
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:06,126
Not only paid her.
He threatened her.

936
01:26:06,128 --> 01:26:08,529
Gave her a script to learn.

937
01:26:08,531 --> 01:26:11,298
Her parents
are alive back home.

938
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:13,300
But the girl's
got a conscience.

939
01:26:13,302 --> 01:26:16,170
He's been using the committee
as his puppet theater. Senator!

940
01:26:16,938 --> 01:26:18,338
Hi, you.

941
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:19,706
Don't go anywhere.
I want to talk to you.

942
01:26:19,708 --> 01:26:21,708
You know what? Mercy, you go in

943
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:23,877
and make sure
no one takes my seat.

944
01:26:23,879 --> 01:26:25,145
So what you been up to?

945
01:26:25,147 --> 01:26:26,947
I'm just here to tell my story.

946
01:26:26,949 --> 01:26:28,482
That I was willing to finance
a Kryptonian deterrent,

947
01:26:28,484 --> 01:26:30,150
but a certain junior senator
from Kentucky

948
01:26:30,152 --> 01:26:32,219
decided to block it.

949
01:26:32,221 --> 01:26:35,856
Yes, the chair of the committee
on superman is soft on security.

950
01:26:35,858 --> 01:26:38,525
Greg, why hasn't he been getting our checks?
He is, Mr. Wayne.

951
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:41,195
He gets a check from
the victims fund every month.

952
01:26:41,197 --> 01:26:43,697
He returns them.

953
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:45,232
<i>Who lost both his legs</i>

954
01:26:45,234 --> 01:26:47,701
<i>in those horrific events</i>
<i>in Metropolis</i>

955
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:49,403
<i>that happened two years ago.</i>

956
01:26:49,405 --> 01:26:50,604
Jesus.

957
01:26:52,674 --> 01:26:54,341
Why haven't I seen this?

958
01:26:54,343 --> 01:26:56,376
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I'll get to the bottom of it.</i>

959
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:59,079
<i>And there he is.</i>
<i>Superman is here.</i>

960
01:26:59,081 --> 01:27:01,348
<i>He is actually</i>
<i>at the United States capitol.</i>

961
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:03,483
<i>This is really</i>
<i>a historic moment.</i>

962
01:27:03,485 --> 01:27:05,819
<i>Now we expect that</i>
<i>superman will give</i>

963
01:27:05,821 --> 01:27:07,888
<i>some kind of a statement</i>
<i>to the senate,</i>

964
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:10,624
<i>to the American people,</i>
<i>and, of course, to the world.</i>

965
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:12,893
He's here. He came.

966
01:27:12,895 --> 01:27:15,395
He's above the capitol.

967
01:27:15,397 --> 01:27:18,065
You are gonna be on the
hot seat in there, junebug.

968
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:19,733
I grew up on a farm.

969
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:22,202
I know how to wrestle a pig.

970
01:27:22,204 --> 01:27:24,404
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, senator?

971
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,307
It's that power
can be innocent.

972
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:30,644
Good luck.

973
01:28:06,547 --> 01:28:08,715
Miss...

974
01:28:08,717 --> 01:28:10,517
Rudy, she's good to go.

975
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,060
Get out!

976
01:28:23,331 --> 01:28:26,166
Get out! Get out!
Superman! Superman!

977
01:28:33,274 --> 01:28:35,375
Another one came
this morning, Mr. Wayne.

978
01:29:14,549 --> 01:29:17,484
Let me say at the outset that
I'm grateful to our witness

979
01:29:17,486 --> 01:29:20,354
for coming before us today.

980
01:29:20,356 --> 01:29:23,123
This is how a democracy works.

981
01:29:23,125 --> 01:29:25,859
We talk to each other.

982
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:31,365
We act by the consent
of the governed, sir.

983
01:29:31,367 --> 01:29:34,701
<i>I have sat here before to say
that shadow interventions</i>

984
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:37,704
<i>will not be tolerated</i>
<i>by this committee.</i>

985
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,239
<i>Neither will lies.</i>

986
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:44,311
Because today
is a day for truth.

987
01:29:46,147 --> 01:29:47,781
Because only by speaking...

988
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:02,396
Only by working together
can we...

989
01:30:08,503 --> 01:30:09,770
Can we...

990
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:23,016
Can we create a free, and a...

991
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,346
<i>My god!</i>

992
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:20,006
<i>We're back</i>
<i>at the nation's capitol,</i>

993
01:31:20,008 --> 01:31:21,708
<i>where something is happening.</i>

994
01:31:39,694 --> 01:31:40,927
<i>Excuse me.</i>

995
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:44,164
Excuse me, officer.

996
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:46,666
Member of the press.
Can you let me in, please?

997
01:31:54,609 --> 01:31:56,209
Breathe slowly and deeply.

998
01:31:56,211 --> 01:31:57,911
You're gonna be fine.

999
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:10,357
Thank you. I'm gonna need
a little room to work.

1000
01:32:10,359 --> 01:32:13,827
<i>Ma'am, it appears you've</i>
<i>suffered a head injury.</i>

1001
01:32:13,829 --> 01:32:16,796
I'm gonna need you to follow
my light with your eyes.

1002
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:08,448
<i>Master Wayne.</i>

1003
01:33:11,519 --> 01:33:14,421
Mr. Wayne!

1004
01:33:14,423 --> 01:33:18,625
<i>In the senate hearing room
where superman was testifying.</i>

1005
01:33:18,627 --> 01:33:21,528
<i>This is a catastrophic situation
at our nation's capitol.</i>

1006
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:23,196
<i>We don't have</i>
<i>exact numbers yet,</i>

1007
01:33:23,198 --> 01:33:25,265
<i>but I can tell you that</i>
<i>more than a dozen people</i>

1008
01:33:25,267 --> 01:33:26,933
<i>have died in this explosion.</i>

1009
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:28,368
<i>First responders</i>
<i>are at the scene.</i>

1010
01:33:28,370 --> 01:33:30,770
<i>They are still bringing</i>
<i>victims out.</i>

1011
01:33:30,772 --> 01:33:34,608
<i>Now initially, superman was helping
bring victims out after the blast</i>

1012
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:36,810
<i>but he seems to have</i>
<i>disappeared...</i>

1013
01:33:36,812 --> 01:33:38,645

1014
01:33:38,647 --> 01:33:41,381
<i>Carrie Birmingham, reporting

1015
01:33:41,383 --> 01:33:44,217
<i>Capitol police are now confirming
that the blast was caused</i>

1016
01:33:44,219 --> 01:33:46,319

<i>Run that one more time for me.</i>

1018
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:17,083
Can you enhance that?
There you go, sir.

1019
01:34:55,956 --> 01:34:58,224
<i>Capitol police are</i>
<i>confirming to CNN</i>

1020

<i>Now these sources...</i>

1022
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:04,364
Clark, it's me again.
Can you...

1023
01:35:04,366 --> 01:35:06,533
<i>could have gotten the explosive
device into the hearing</i>

1024
01:35:06,535 --> 01:35:08,902
<i>by concealing them</i>
<i>inside his wheelchair.</i>

1025
01:35:08,904 --> 01:35:10,837
<i>As for superman,</i>
<i>he was in the room,</i>

1026
01:35:10,839 --> 01:35:12,338
<i>but obviously</i>
<i>failed to stop him.</i>

1027
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:14,808
I didn't see it, lo.

1028
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:16,876
I was standing right there
and I didn't see it.

1029
01:35:16,878 --> 01:35:18,545
Clark, there are people
behind this.

1030
01:35:18,547 --> 01:35:20,780
I'm afraid I didn't see it
because I wasn't looking.

1031
01:35:24,218 --> 01:35:26,352
All this time,

1032
01:35:26,354 --> 01:35:28,922
I've been living my life
the way my father saw it.

1033
01:35:30,057 --> 01:35:31,725
Righting wrongs for a ghost.

1034
01:35:34,528 --> 01:35:36,396
Thinking I'm here to do good.

1035
01:35:40,701 --> 01:35:43,103
Superman was never real.

1036
01:35:43,105 --> 01:35:45,805
Just the dream of a farmer
from Kansas.

1037
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:50,910
That farmer's dream
is all some people have.

1038
01:35:50,912 --> 01:35:52,679
It's all that gives them hope.

1039
01:36:04,058 --> 01:36:05,959
This means something.

1040
01:36:07,261 --> 01:36:10,196
It did on my world.

1041
01:36:10,198 --> 01:36:12,165

<i>Now one FBI official</i>

What do you mean?

1107
01:44:41,643 --> 01:44:44,277
The inside of the chair
was lined with lead.

1108
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:48,414
You couldn't stop it.

1109
01:44:48,416 --> 01:44:50,683
You couldn't see it.

1110
01:45:33,193 --> 01:45:34,593
Something, isn't it?

1111
01:45:36,463 --> 01:45:38,431
We men of Kansas
live on a pancake,

1112
01:45:38,433 --> 01:45:40,032
so we come to the mountains.

1113
01:45:41,535 --> 01:45:45,338
All downhill from here,
down to the floodplain.

1114
01:45:45,340 --> 01:45:47,239
Farm at the bottom
of the world.

1115
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:52,211
I remember one season
the water came bad.

1116
01:45:52,213 --> 01:45:54,146
I couldn't have been 12.

1117
01:45:54,148 --> 01:45:57,149
Dad had out the shovels
and we went at it all night.

1118
01:45:57,151 --> 01:45:59,318
We worked till,
I think, I fainted.

1119
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:01,120
But we managed
to stop the water.

1120
01:46:02,356 --> 01:46:05,391
We saved the farm.

1121
01:46:05,393 --> 01:46:08,594
Your grandma baked me a cake.
Said I was a hero.

1122
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:12,765
Later that day we found out

1123
01:46:14,034 --> 01:46:15,201
we blocked the water all right.

1124
01:46:15,203 --> 01:46:17,703
We sent it upstream.

1125
01:46:17,705 --> 01:46:21,240
The whole lang farm
washed away.

1126
01:46:21,242 --> 01:46:24,243
<i>While I ate my hero cake,</i>
<i>their horses were drowning.</i>

1127
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:29,882
I used to hear them
wailing in my sleep.

1128
01:46:33,253 --> 01:46:35,221
Did the nightmares ever stop?

1129
01:46:37,524 --> 01:46:38,891
Yeah.

1130
01:46:39,893 --> 01:46:41,827
When I met your mother.

1131
01:46:43,830 --> 01:46:46,665
She gave me faith that
there's good in this world.

1132
01:46:49,069 --> 01:46:51,470
<i>She was my world.</i>

1133
01:46:54,074 --> 01:46:55,674
I miss you, son.

1134
01:47:00,580 --> 01:47:02,648
I miss you too, dad.

1135
01:47:22,436 --> 01:47:23,869
You know you can't win this.

1136
01:47:25,772 --> 01:47:27,373
It's suicide.

1137
01:47:30,110 --> 01:47:33,179
I'm older now than
my father ever was.

1138
01:47:35,482 --> 01:47:39,285
This may be the only thing
I do that matters.

1139
01:47:39,287 --> 01:47:43,222
20 years of fighting criminals
amounts to nothing?

1140
01:47:43,224 --> 01:47:45,958
Criminals are
like weeds, Alfred.

1141
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:48,360
Pull one up,
another grows in its place.

1142
01:47:50,430 --> 01:47:52,631
This is about
the future of the world.

1143
01:47:54,401 --> 01:47:56,035
This is my legacy.

1144
01:47:57,270 --> 01:47:59,638
My father
sat me down right here.

1145
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:01,807
Told me what Wayne manor
was built on.

1146
01:48:01,809 --> 01:48:05,311
Railroads, real estates,
and oil.

1147
01:48:05,313 --> 01:48:08,981
The first generation made their
fortune trading with the French.

1148
01:48:08,983 --> 01:48:10,683
Pelts and skins.

1149
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:16,222
They were hunters.

1150
01:48:32,606 --> 01:48:36,375
So falls the house of Wayne.

1151
01:48:36,377 --> 01:48:38,177
<i>We gotta</i>
<i>wait for more evidence,</i>

1152
01:48:38,179 --> 01:48:40,145
<i>but the question still remains,</i>

1153
01:48:40,147 --> 01:48:42,014
<i>where is he?</i>

1154
01:48:42,016 --> 01:48:44,350
<i>If superman was not involved,</i>

1155
01:48:44,352 --> 01:48:47,720
<i>if he's got nothing to hide,</i>
<i>then why hasn't he been seen</i>

1156
01:48:47,722 --> 01:48:49,655
<i>since the day of this tragedy?</i>

1157
01:48:49,657 --> 01:48:51,724
<i>You can't point a finger and...</i>

1158
01:48:51,726 --> 01:48:53,626
<i>I'm not pointing anything, Warren.
Look. Ten fingers, see?</i>

1159
01:48:53,628 --> 01:48:55,294
<i>If there is</i>
<i>going to be a criminal...</i>

1160
01:50:24,050 --> 01:50:25,851
The night is here.

1161
01:50:56,483 --> 01:50:57,549
Excuse me.

1162
01:50:59,753 --> 01:51:00,986
Don't I know...

1163
01:52:04,084 --> 01:52:07,920
Plain lo in the morning.
Lola in slacks.

1164
01:52:09,156 --> 01:52:10,289
Lois Lane.

1165
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:14,526
Come see the view.

1166
01:52:16,897 --> 01:52:19,098
Now the secret to the height

1167
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:21,400
is the building material.

1168
01:52:21,402 --> 01:52:24,903
It's light metals which sway
a bit in the wind.

1169
01:52:29,576 --> 01:52:32,911
And you know something about lexcorp
metals, don't you, miss Lane?

1170
01:52:32,913 --> 01:52:34,780
I've proven what you've done.

1171
01:52:34,782 --> 01:52:36,882
Wow, you're feisty.

1172
01:52:36,884 --> 01:52:39,384
Unfortunately,
that will blow away.

1173
01:52:39,386 --> 01:52:41,420
Like sand in the desert.

1174
01:52:41,422 --> 01:52:42,554
You're psychotic.

1175
01:52:42,556 --> 01:52:44,022
That is a three-syllable word

1176
01:52:44,024 --> 01:52:46,558
for any thought too big
for little minds.

1177
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:49,361
Circles.

1178
01:52:49,363 --> 01:52:54,133
Round and round and round
they go to find superman.

1179
01:52:54,135 --> 01:52:56,268
Wrong category, boy.
No, no, triangles.

1180
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:57,870
Yes, euclid's
triangle inequality.

1181
01:52:57,872 --> 01:53:00,072
The shortest distance
between any two points

1182
01:53:00,074 --> 01:53:01,874
is a straight path.

1183
01:53:01,876 --> 01:53:04,810
And I believe the straightest
path to superman

1184
01:53:04,812 --> 01:53:06,311
is a pretty little road...

1185
01:53:06,313 --> 01:53:08,747
Called Lois Lane.

1186
01:53:31,271 --> 01:53:32,704
You came back.

1187
01:53:33,573 --> 01:53:34,907
You came back.

1188
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:56,361
Boy, do we have
problems up here!

1189
01:54:00,935 --> 01:54:03,335
The problem of...
Of evil in the world.

1190
01:54:03,337 --> 01:54:05,537
The problem of absolute virtue.

1191
01:54:05,539 --> 01:54:07,706
I'll take you in
without breaking you.

1192
01:54:07,708 --> 01:54:09,508
Which is more than you deserve.

1193
01:54:09,510 --> 01:54:11,977
The problem of you
on top of everything else.

1194
01:54:11,979 --> 01:54:13,679
You above all.

1195
01:54:13,681 --> 01:54:16,181
Because that's what god is.

1196
01:54:16,183 --> 01:54:20,252
Horus. Apollo. Jehovah. Kal-El.

1197
01:54:21,187 --> 01:54:24,556
Clark Joseph Kent.

1198
01:54:26,326 --> 01:54:30,529
See, what we call god depends
upon our tribe, Clark-Joe.

1199
01:54:30,531 --> 01:54:33,665
Because god is tribal.
God takes sides.

1200
01:54:33,667 --> 01:54:35,667
No man in the sky intervened
when I was a boy

1201
01:54:35,669 --> 01:54:38,704
to deliver me from daddy's
fist and abominations.

1202
01:54:38,706 --> 01:54:42,507
I figured out way back,
if god is all-powerful,

1203
01:54:42,509 --> 01:54:43,942
he cannot be all-good.

1204
01:54:45,645 --> 01:54:47,212
And if he is all-good,

1205
01:54:47,214 --> 01:54:49,548
then he cannot be all-powerful.

1206
01:54:49,550 --> 01:54:51,149
And neither can you be.

1207
01:54:52,352 --> 01:54:54,386
They need to see
the fraud you are.

1208
01:54:54,988 --> 01:54:56,288
With their eyes.

1209
01:54:57,557 --> 01:55:00,425
The blood on your hands.

1210
01:55:00,427 --> 01:55:01,593
What have you done?

1211
01:55:01,595 --> 01:55:03,495
And tonight, they will.

1212
01:55:03,497 --> 01:55:07,666
Yes. Because you, my friend,
have a date.

1213
01:55:07,668 --> 01:55:09,167
Across the bay.

1214
01:55:09,169 --> 01:55:11,737
Ripe fruit, his hate.
Two years growing.

1215
01:55:11,739 --> 01:55:13,772
But it did not take much
to push him over, actually.

1216
01:55:13,774 --> 01:55:15,340
Little red notes, big bang.

1217
01:55:15,342 --> 01:55:18,076
You let your family die!

1218
01:55:18,078 --> 01:55:23,782
<i>And now you will fly to him.</i>
<i>And you will battle him.</i>

1219
01:55:23,784 --> 01:55:25,350
To the death.

1220
01:55:26,586 --> 01:55:29,621
Black and blue. Fight night!

1221
01:55:29,623 --> 01:55:33,125
The greatest gladiator match
in the history of the world.

1222
01:55:33,127 --> 01:55:35,961
God versus man.

1223
01:55:35,963 --> 01:55:38,864
Day versus night.

1224
01:55:38,866 --> 01:55:41,934
Son of Krypton versus
bat of Gotham.

1225
01:55:41,936 --> 01:55:44,202
You think I'll fight him
for you?

1226
01:55:44,204 --> 01:55:46,972
Yes, I do. I think
you will fight-fight-fight

1227
01:55:46,974 --> 01:55:48,941
for that special lady
in your life.

1228
01:55:48,943 --> 01:55:51,243
She's safe on the ground.
How about you?

1229
01:55:51,245 --> 01:55:54,880
Close, but I am
not talking about Lois.

1230
01:55:54,882 --> 01:55:59,284
No. Every boy's special lady
is his mother.

1231
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:07,459
Martha, Martha, Martha.

1232
01:56:09,430 --> 01:56:13,398
Why, the mother of a flying
demon must be a witch.

1233
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:16,268
The punishment for witches,
what is that?

1234
01:56:16,270 --> 01:56:18,403
That's right. Death by fire.

1235
01:56:27,981 --> 01:56:30,015
Where is she?

1236
01:56:30,017 --> 01:56:31,817
I don't know! I would
not let them tell me!

1237
01:56:31,819 --> 01:56:34,319
If you kill me, Martha dies.

1238
01:56:34,321 --> 01:56:36,488
And if you fly away,
Martha also dies.

1239
01:56:36,490 --> 01:56:39,491
But if you kill the bat...

1240
01:56:39,493 --> 01:56:40,926
Martha lives.

1241
01:56:45,832 --> 01:56:49,101
There we go. There we go.

1242
01:56:51,671 --> 01:56:55,607
And now god bends to my will.

1243
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:04,182
Ooh, now the cameras
are waiting at your ship.

1244
01:57:04,184 --> 01:57:06,451
For the world to see
the holes in the holy.

1245
01:57:06,453 --> 01:57:07,953
Yes, the almighty comes clean

1246
01:57:07,955 --> 01:57:09,321
about how dirty he is
when it counts.

1247
01:57:09,323 --> 01:57:11,023
To save Martha,

1248
01:57:11,025 --> 01:57:12,691
bring me the head of the bat.

1249
01:57:17,498 --> 01:57:20,365
Mother of god,
would you look at the time?

1250
01:57:20,367 --> 01:57:22,701
When you came here,
you had an hour.

1251
01:57:23,970 --> 01:57:25,871
Now it's less.

1252
01:58:27,533 --> 01:58:29,234
<i>Brooke Baldwin is on the scene.</i>

1253
01:58:29,236 --> 01:58:31,470
<i>Brooke, you're live on the air.
What are you seeing?</i>

1254
01:58:31,472 --> 01:58:32,938
There's something
happening at the ship.

1255
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:37,242
It's sending
massive power surges.

1256
01:58:37,244 --> 01:58:39,077
<i>Police helicopters</i>
<i>surrounding the area.</i>

1257
01:58:39,079 --> 01:58:41,813
<i>They've created a barricade
around this containment center.</i>

1258
01:58:41,815 --> 01:58:43,415
<i>And we're trying to get</i>
<i>a little bit closer here</i>

1259
01:58:43,417 --> 01:58:45,117
<i>to find out what's going on.</i>

1260
01:58:45,119 --> 01:58:47,119
<i>It is absolute chaos.</i>
<i>You can see that lightning,</i>

1261
01:58:47,121 --> 01:58:48,787
<i>those surges of electricity.</i>

1262
01:58:48,789 --> 01:58:52,057
<i>They seem to be getting</i>
<i>stronger by the minute.</i>

<i>Daily planet.</i>

1264
01:58:54,795 --> 01:58:59,164
Lois. I have to go to Gotham
to convince him to help me.

1265
01:58:59,166 --> 01:59:00,232
Who?

1266
01:59:02,602 --> 01:59:04,636
Or he has to die.

1267
01:59:04,638 --> 01:59:05,871
Clark.

1268
01:59:09,242 --> 01:59:11,409
No one stays good
in this world.

1269
01:59:20,353 --> 01:59:24,356
<i>But as of right now, much of the
city remains in the dark tonight.</i>

1270
01:59:24,358 --> 01:59:28,693
<i>Much chaos. Much confusing happening
on the streets of Metropolis tonight.</i>

1271
01:59:28,695 --> 01:59:30,862
<i>Those helicopters are still</i>
<i>surrounding the area.</i>

1272
01:59:30,864 --> 01:59:33,398
<i>I don't know if you can still
see those bolts of lightning...</i>

1273
02:01:35,254 --> 02:01:40,292
<i>2400 hours and 2 minutes.</i>
<i>Subject declining rapidly.</i>

1274
02:01:40,294 --> 02:01:42,360
<i>All procedural interventions</i>
<i>have failed.</i>

1275
02:01:43,229 --> 02:01:44,796
<i>Outcome</i>

1276
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:48,667
<i>will be death.</i>

1277
02:01:57,343 --> 02:02:00,145
<i>Dr. Silas stone suspending</i>
<i>all clinical protocol.</i>

1278
02:02:00,147 --> 02:02:06,885
<i>Us gov, object 6-19-82</i>
<i>is successfully activated.</i>

1279
02:02:28,507 --> 02:02:29,808
<i>I need a chopper to Gotham.</i>

1280
02:02:29,810 --> 02:02:31,209
Call the heliport.

1281
02:02:31,211 --> 02:02:32,977
Chopper? We can
barely afford a bicycle.

1282
02:02:32,979 --> 02:02:34,145
You wanna chase a story?

1283
02:02:34,147 --> 02:02:35,447
Go to the ship.

1284
02:02:35,449 --> 02:02:36,815
Superman's probably
there already.

1285
02:02:36,817 --> 02:02:39,584
Perry, it's not for a story.

1286
02:02:44,457 --> 02:02:46,157
Jenny, get her
a chopper to Gotham.

1287
02:02:46,159 --> 02:02:48,693
And forget the heliport.
Put it on the goddamn roof.

1288
02:02:48,695 --> 02:02:50,195
On the roof, Lois!

1289
02:02:52,865 --> 02:02:54,532
Where are we headed?

1290
02:02:54,534 --> 02:02:55,734
There!

1291
02:03:11,717 --> 02:03:14,753
<i>Well, here I am.</i>

1292
02:03:16,088 --> 02:03:17,455
Bruce. Please.

1293
02:03:19,225 --> 02:03:22,093
I was wrong.
You have to listen to me.

1294
02:03:22,095 --> 02:03:23,328
Lex wants us to...

1295
02:03:38,744 --> 02:03:41,079
You don't understand.

1296
02:03:41,081 --> 02:03:42,447
There's no time!

1297
02:03:44,083 --> 02:03:45,250
<i>I understand.</i>

1298
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:03,328
Stay down!

1299
02:05:03,330 --> 02:05:05,763
If I wanted it,
you'd be dead already.

1300
02:05:43,836 --> 02:05:45,136
<i>Breathe it in.</i>

1301
02:05:47,907 --> 02:05:49,774
<i>That's fear.</i>

1302
02:05:52,678 --> 02:05:54,112
<i>You're not brave.</i>

1303
02:05:58,417 --> 02:05:59,951
<i>Men are brave.</i>

1304
02:09:49,715 --> 02:09:54,385
<i>I bet your parents taught you</i>
<i>that you mean something.</i>

1305
02:09:54,387 --> 02:09:56,053
<i>That you're here for a reason.</i>

1306
02:09:57,556 --> 02:10:01,259
<i>My parents taught me</i>
<i>a different lesson,</i>

1307
02:10:01,261 --> 02:10:03,728
<i>dying in the gutter</i>

1308
02:10:03,730 --> 02:10:05,730
<i>for no reason at all.</i>

1309
02:10:22,481 --> 02:10:25,149
<i>They taught me the world</i>
<i>only makes sense</i>

1310
02:10:25,151 --> 02:10:27,218
<i>if you force it to.</i>

1311
02:11:05,557 --> 02:11:07,458
<i>You were never a god.</i>

1312
02:11:10,229 --> 02:11:12,396
<i>You were never even a man.</i>

1313
02:11:19,338 --> 02:11:22,707
You're letting him kill Martha.

1314
02:11:28,347 --> 02:11:30,147
<i>What does that mean?</i>

1315
02:11:31,350 --> 02:11:32,917
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

1316
02:11:34,186 --> 02:11:36,754
Find him.

1317
02:11:37,990 --> 02:11:39,690
Save.

1318
02:11:39,692 --> 02:11:41,392
<i>Martha.</i>

1319
02:11:44,329 --> 02:11:45,730
<i>Martha.</i>

1320
02:12:16,528 --> 02:12:18,429
Martha.

1321
02:12:22,634 --> 02:12:23,801
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

1322
02:12:25,738 --> 02:12:27,571
<i>Martha!</i>
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

1323
02:12:27,573 --> 02:12:28,873
Clark! Stop!

1324
02:12:28,875 --> 02:12:30,241
Please! Stop!

1325
02:12:30,243 --> 02:12:31,909
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

1326
02:12:31,911 --> 02:12:34,378
It's his mother's name!

1327
02:12:34,380 --> 02:12:36,647
It's his mother's name.

1328
02:13:08,247 --> 02:13:09,780
<i>We're not getting any answers.</i>

1329
02:13:09,782 --> 02:13:11,315
We're still right outside
the containment center.

1330
02:13:11,317 --> 02:13:12,516
A dangerous situation.

1331
02:13:12,518 --> 02:13:13,951
Military and police personnel

1332
02:13:13,953 --> 02:13:15,519
<i>surrounding the area.</i>

1333
02:13:31,036 --> 02:13:32,303
<i>Luthor.</i>

1334
02:13:32,305 --> 02:13:34,772
He wanted your life for hers.

1335
02:13:35,974 --> 02:13:37,808
She's losing time.

1336
02:13:37,810 --> 02:13:40,711
The scout ship seems to be
drawing power from the city.

1337
02:13:40,713 --> 02:13:42,279
It's got to be Lex.

1338
02:13:42,281 --> 02:13:45,016
<i>They need you at that ship.</i>
<i>I'll find her.</i>

1339
02:13:45,018 --> 02:13:47,118
My mother needs me. <i>Wait.</i>

1340
02:13:48,220 --> 02:13:50,654
<i>I'll make you a promise.</i>

1341
02:13:50,656 --> 02:13:52,923
<i>Martha won't die tonight.</i>

1342
02:14:19,651 --> 02:14:21,018
<i>Master Wayne.</i>

1343
02:14:21,020 --> 02:14:22,253
<i>Alfred.</i>

1344
02:14:22,255 --> 02:14:24,021
I'm sorry for listening in,

1345
02:14:24,023 --> 02:14:25,556
but I've tracked
the Russian's phone

1346
02:14:25,558 --> 02:14:27,224
to a warehouse near the port.

1347
02:14:27,226 --> 02:14:28,759
<i>You're locked onto it.</i>

1348
02:14:28,761 --> 02:14:30,327
<i>I don't deserve you, Alfred.</i>

1349
02:14:30,329 --> 02:14:32,797
No, sir. You don't.

1350
02:14:53,552 --> 02:14:55,486
I'm afraid this is goodbye.

1351
02:14:57,389 --> 02:15:01,592
And every time we say
goodbye, you die a little.

1352
02:15:14,739 --> 02:15:16,540
- Take it down.
- Go! Go!

1353
02:15:39,898 --> 02:15:41,232
<i>You have to take it, Alfred.</i>

1354
02:15:41,900 --> 02:15:43,801
Right.

1355
02:15:43,803 --> 02:15:45,870
Commencing drone mode.

1356
02:15:48,840 --> 02:15:50,674
Thermal imaging is showing me

1357
02:15:50,676 --> 02:15:53,277
two dozen hostiles
on the third floor.

1358
02:15:53,279 --> 02:15:55,679
Why don't I drop you off
on the second?

1359
02:19:00,765 --> 02:19:02,499
Drop it.

1360
02:19:04,169 --> 02:19:06,070
I said drop it!

1361
02:19:07,038 --> 02:19:08,372
I'll kill her.

1362
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:12,443
Believe me, I'll do it.

1363
02:19:15,313 --> 02:19:16,447
<i>I believe you.</i>

1364
02:19:28,828 --> 02:19:31,862
<i>It's okay.</i>
<i>I'm a friend of your son's.</i>

1365
02:19:31,864 --> 02:19:34,765
I figured. The cape.

1366
02:20:02,862 --> 02:20:04,395
"Late, late,"
says the white rabbit.

1367
02:20:04,397 --> 02:20:06,196
<i>40 seconds to animation.</i>

1368
02:20:06,198 --> 02:20:07,831
Right, wabbit?

1369
02:20:07,833 --> 02:20:11,602
Out of tricks, out of time.

1370
02:20:12,670 --> 02:20:15,172
And one bat head short.

1371
02:20:15,174 --> 02:20:17,007
<i>30 seconds to animation.</i>

1372
02:20:17,009 --> 02:20:18,776
That'll be the cook.

1373
02:20:18,778 --> 02:20:19,943
Excuse me.

1374
02:20:19,945 --> 02:20:22,880
Gotham roast. Well done.

1375
02:20:22,882 --> 02:20:25,048
Hello. Break the bad news.

1376
02:20:25,050 --> 02:20:27,951
<i>I'd rather do</i>
<i>the breaking in person.</i>

1377
02:20:27,953 --> 02:20:29,686
<i>20 seconds to animation.</i>

1378
02:20:29,688 --> 02:20:30,754
You've lost.

1379
02:20:31,723 --> 02:20:32,956
I don't know how to lose.

1380
02:20:32,958 --> 02:20:34,124
You'll learn.

1381
02:20:34,126 --> 02:20:35,759
I'll learn.

1382
02:20:35,761 --> 02:20:38,262
I don't hate the sinner.

1383
02:20:38,264 --> 02:20:40,364
- I hate the sin.
<i>- 10 seconds to animation.</i>

1384
02:20:40,366 --> 02:20:43,033
And yours, my friend,
is existing.

1385
02:20:43,868 --> 02:20:45,469
I cannot let you win.

1386
02:20:45,471 --> 02:20:46,737
I gave the bat a fighting
chance to do it,

1387
02:20:46,739 --> 02:20:47,805
but he was not strong enough.

1388
02:20:47,807 --> 02:20:49,807
So, if man won't kill god...

1389
02:20:49,809 --> 02:20:51,975
<i>two, one.</i>

1390
02:20:53,645 --> 02:20:54,745
The devil will do it!

1391
02:21:11,464 --> 02:21:12,896
Perry!

1392
02:21:12,898 --> 02:21:15,566
All right.
Stay calm, everybody!

1393
02:21:15,568 --> 02:21:17,000
<i>We're getting reports</i>

How best to describe it?

1421
02:25:21,513 --> 02:25:23,413
<i>Metropolis airspace</i>
<i>has been closed briefly.</i>

1422
02:25:23,415 --> 02:25:24,981
Excuse me?

1423
02:25:24,983 --> 02:25:25,682
<i>We kindly ask that</i>
<i>you stay in your seats.</i>

1424
02:25:25,684 --> 02:25:27,050
Excuse me?

1425
02:25:27,052 --> 02:25:28,452
Miss prince?

1426
02:25:42,900 --> 02:25:44,901
Sir. Look,
they've cleared the city.

1427
02:25:44,903 --> 02:25:46,570
Looks like he's taking it
into space.

1428
02:25:46,572 --> 02:25:48,405
We can go straight to
key red, Mr. president.

1429
02:25:48,407 --> 02:25:50,040
Not yet. Are you crazy?

1430
02:25:50,042 --> 02:25:51,341
They're high enough
that we can nuke 'em

1431
02:25:51,343 --> 02:25:52,709
with no casualties, sir.

1432
02:25:52,711 --> 02:25:55,645
One casualty, Mr. president.
Superman.

1433
02:25:58,217 --> 02:25:59,583
<i>God have mercy on us all.</i>

1434
02:26:05,923 --> 02:26:07,958
Key is hot. Key is hot.

1435
02:26:07,960 --> 02:26:09,993
Red birds are armed
to deploy, sir.

1436
02:26:11,262 --> 02:26:12,562
<i>Fire at will.</i>

1437
02:26:12,564 --> 02:26:14,598
Three, two, one...

1438
02:27:03,614 --> 02:27:04,915
<i>God.</i>

1439
02:27:27,138 --> 02:27:28,505
Projectile 1. Impact.

1440
02:27:28,507 --> 02:27:30,540
Stryker's island,
east of Metropolis.

1441
02:27:30,542 --> 02:27:31,842
That's uninhabited.

1442
02:27:31,844 --> 02:27:33,376
Projectile 2...

1443
02:27:38,950 --> 02:27:41,151
No apparent reentry.

1444
02:27:41,153 --> 02:27:43,119
<i>Projectile 2?</i>

1445
02:27:43,121 --> 02:27:48,959
Superman, Mr. president.
Projectile 2 was superman.

1446
02:27:48,961 --> 02:27:50,260
Sir.

1447
02:27:50,962 --> 02:27:52,095
It's moving.

1448
02:28:33,537 --> 02:28:35,238
<i>The shockwaves</i>
<i>are getting stronger.</i>

1449
02:28:35,240 --> 02:28:38,408
Every time we hit it,
we make it more powerful.

1450
02:28:38,410 --> 02:28:41,077
We can't attack.

1451
02:28:41,079 --> 02:28:43,546
<i>What are you saying, Calvin?</i>

1452
02:28:43,548 --> 02:28:45,782
I'm saying it's unkillable.

1453
02:29:13,277 --> 02:29:15,612
Master Wayne,
are you receiving me?

1454
02:29:15,614 --> 02:29:16,780
<i>Alfred.</i>

1455
02:29:16,782 --> 02:29:18,615
<i>It's Kryptonian.</i>

1456
02:29:18,617 --> 02:29:21,318
<i>Only kryptonite weapons</i>
<i>can kill it.</i>

1457
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:24,487
They might.
If you had any left.

1458
02:29:24,489 --> 02:29:27,958
<i>I got one round left.</i>

1459
02:29:27,960 --> 02:29:32,128
<i>The spear. Alfred, the spear.
It's pure kryptonite.</i>

1460
02:29:32,130 --> 02:29:33,897
<i>It's back in Gotham.</i>

1461
02:29:33,899 --> 02:29:36,766
<i>If I can penetrate the skin,</i>
<i>the spear will kill it.</i>

1462
02:29:36,768 --> 02:29:38,435
It would in theory.

1463
02:29:38,437 --> 02:29:40,937
<i>I've gotta get it to chase me</i>
<i>back to the city.</i>

1464
02:29:40,939 --> 02:29:42,672
<i>Back to the kryptonite.</i>

1465
02:30:43,334 --> 02:30:44,934
<i>Shit.</i>

1466
02:31:34,352 --> 02:31:36,419
Why did you bring him
back to the city?

1467
02:31:36,421 --> 02:31:37,921
<i>The port is abandoned.</i>

1468
02:31:37,923 --> 02:31:39,789
<i>There's a weapon here</i>
<i>that can kill it.</i>

1469
02:31:52,369 --> 02:31:53,636
Did you find the spear?

1470
02:31:54,605 --> 02:31:56,372
<i>I've been a little busy.</i>

1471
02:31:56,374 --> 02:31:59,676
This thing, this creature,
seems to feed on energy.

1472
02:32:01,745 --> 02:32:04,647
This thing is
from another world.

1473
02:32:05,316 --> 02:32:06,649
My world.

1474
02:32:06,651 --> 02:32:09,319
I've killed things
from other worlds before.

1475
02:32:10,955 --> 02:32:12,155
Is she with you?

1476
02:32:13,124 --> 02:32:15,024
<i>I thought she was with you.</i>

1477
02:35:53,477 --> 02:35:55,011
Clark!

1478
02:35:55,013 --> 02:35:56,379
Clark!

1479
02:36:03,854 --> 02:36:04,921
Clark!

1480
02:36:15,400 --> 02:36:17,300
Clark!

1481
02:36:17,302 --> 02:36:18,935
Clark! Are you all right?

1482
02:36:56,740 --> 02:36:58,474
I love you.

1483
02:37:02,079 --> 02:37:05,515
No. No, Clark, you can't.

1484
02:37:07,251 --> 02:37:09,185
This is my world.

1485
02:37:09,187 --> 02:37:10,653
No, Clark, don't.

1486
02:37:14,258 --> 02:37:16,626
You are my world.

1487
02:37:16,628 --> 02:37:17,760
No.

1488
02:37:20,931 --> 02:37:22,665
Please. Clark!

1489
02:44:28,625 --> 02:44:29,692
Hi.

1490
02:44:36,700 --> 02:44:39,435
Clark had this sent here,
so he could surprise you.

1491
02:47:06,516 --> 02:47:08,684
"The dead shall live."

1492
02:47:09,519 --> 02:47:12,755
"My slain shall rise again."

1493
02:47:15,725 --> 02:47:18,594
"Awake and sing,
ye that dwell in dust."

1494
02:47:20,030 --> 02:47:23,365
"For thy dew is like
the dew of morning."

1495
02:47:25,201 --> 02:47:30,139
"And the earth shall
give birth to her dead."

1496
02:47:37,547 --> 02:47:40,215
I need a ride
back to the house.

1497
02:47:40,217 --> 02:47:42,918
I forgot my checkbook
to pay the funeral director.

1498
02:47:42,920 --> 02:47:45,054
They said it's all
taken care of.

1499
02:47:45,056 --> 02:47:46,121
By whom?

1500
02:47:47,057 --> 02:47:48,791
Anonymous donor.

1501
02:48:32,602 --> 02:48:36,772
All those circuses back east
burying an empty box.

1502
02:48:36,774 --> 02:48:38,841
They don't know
how to honor him,

1503
02:48:39,876 --> 02:48:41,677
except as a soldier.

1504
02:48:43,446 --> 02:48:46,782
I've failed him in life.

1505
02:48:48,251 --> 02:48:52,054
I won't fail him in death.

1506
02:48:52,056 --> 02:48:54,723
Help me find
the others like you.

1507
02:48:54,725 --> 02:48:56,658
Perhaps they don't
want to be found.

1508
02:48:57,594 --> 02:49:00,395
They will. And they'll fight.

1509
02:49:01,598 --> 02:49:03,565
We have to stand together.

1510
02:49:11,307 --> 02:49:14,543
100 years ago,
I walked away from mankind.

1511
02:49:16,613 --> 02:49:18,580
From a century of horrors.

1512
02:49:22,152 --> 02:49:25,854
Man made a world where standing
together is impossible.

1513
02:49:28,925 --> 02:49:30,859
Men are still good.

1514
02:49:33,329 --> 02:49:36,231
<i>We fight. We kill.</i>

1515
02:49:37,433 --> 02:49:39,835
<i>We betray one another.</i>

1516
02:49:41,704 --> 02:49:43,772
<i>But we can rebuild.</i>

1517
02:49:45,008 --> 02:49:46,875
<i>We can do better.</i>

1518
02:49:48,144 --> 02:49:50,179
<i>We will.</i>

1519
02:49:50,181 --> 02:49:51,380
<i>We have to.</i>

1520
02:50:14,470 --> 02:50:16,038
The others like me.

1521
02:50:16,040 --> 02:50:18,307
Why did you say
they'll have to fight?

1522
02:50:23,713 --> 02:50:25,948
Just a feeling.

1523
02:50:37,160 --> 02:50:39,761
Prisoner a-c-23-19-40.

1524
02:50:39,763 --> 02:50:42,497
The warden wants to speak to
you, so stand to your feet.

1525
02:50:44,100 --> 02:50:46,001
I'm gonna say this
one more time.

1526
02:50:46,003 --> 02:50:48,804
The warden wants to speak to
you, so stand to your feet.

1527
02:50:56,679 --> 02:50:58,580
Turn around and face the wall.

1528
02:51:00,617 --> 02:51:03,018
Place your forehead
against the wall.

1529
02:51:03,020 --> 02:51:04,920
Put your hands
behind your back,

1530
02:51:04,922 --> 02:51:06,989
so that I can come in
and restrain you.

1531
02:51:35,285 --> 02:51:38,220
<i>Whatever you do,</i>
<i>wherever you go,</i>

1532
02:51:38,222 --> 02:51:40,322
<i>I'll be watching you.</i>

1533
02:51:43,793 --> 02:51:45,360
Look at us.

1534
02:51:46,462 --> 02:51:48,764
This is how it all caves in.

1535
02:51:48,766 --> 02:51:54,169
Civilization on the Wayne
manor's out the window.

1536
02:51:58,242 --> 02:52:01,143
But who would believe me? I...

1537
02:52:01,145 --> 02:52:03,578
I'm insane.

1538
02:52:04,847 --> 02:52:07,015
I'm not even
fit to stand trial.

1539
02:52:07,017 --> 02:52:08,950
That's right.

1540
02:52:08,952 --> 02:52:12,788
We have hospitals that treat the
mentally ill with compassion.

1541
02:52:14,091 --> 02:52:16,091
But that's not
where you're going.

1542
02:52:16,093 --> 02:52:19,594
I arranged for you to get transferred
to arkham asylum in Gotham.

1543
02:52:20,997 --> 02:52:23,532
I still have
some friends there.

1544
02:52:23,534 --> 02:52:25,167
They're expecting you.

1545
02:52:29,672 --> 02:52:33,909
But the bell's
already been rung.

1546
02:52:36,379 --> 02:52:37,846
And they've heard it.

1547
02:52:39,682 --> 02:52:41,450
Out in the dark.

1548
02:52:41,452 --> 02:52:44,119
Among the stars.

1549
02:52:47,190 --> 02:52:50,759
Ding dong, the god is dead.

1550
02:53:00,136 --> 02:53:02,938
But a bell cannot be unrung!

1551
02:53:04,240 --> 02:53:07,776
He's hungry. He's found us.

1552
02:53:08,978 --> 02:53:10,746
And he's coming!
