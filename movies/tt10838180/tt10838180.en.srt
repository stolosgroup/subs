00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,350
- <i>Seq, I'm in.</i>
- <i>Captain.</i>

4
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:00,685
<i>You were right.</i>

5
00:01:00,768 --> 00:01:02,186
<i>The skylight
was a window pane.</i>

6
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,771
<i>I've got
serious interference.</i>

7
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,189
<i>Weird.
It's some kind of Modal.</i>

8
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,066
<i>Looks like old code.</i>

9
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,526
<i>It feels
really familiar.</i>

10
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:10,361
<i>Drop a pin.
I'll signal for backup.</i>

11
00:01:10,444 --> 00:01:12,113
- <i>I'm gonna check it out.</i>
- <i>Bugs?</i>

12
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:13,406
<i>If the general finds out
we've been fishing...</i>

13
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:15,158
<i>A quick peek can't hurt.</i>

14
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,534
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

15
00:01:16,617 --> 00:01:17,994
<i>Shit. I think
our signal was traced.</i>

16
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:20,204
<i>Bugs, this feels like a trap.</i>

17
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,414
<i>Bugs!</i>

18
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,873
Freeze!
Do not move!

19
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:04,916
We will shoot!

20
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,294
Very slowly, raise your hands.

21
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,768
Here we go.

22
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,108
Hey, where are you going?

23
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,401
You were warned, Lieutenant.

24
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,737
I think we can handle
one little girl.

25
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:39,283
You're wasting your time!

26
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,619
My men are bringing her
down now.

27
00:02:41,702 --> 00:02:42,787
No, Lieutenant,

28
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:45,873
your men are already dead.

29
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:57,677
Seq, you with me?

30
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,136
This old code keeps crashing.

31
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,554
Your projection's breaking up.
Switch to audio.

32
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:01,973
Bugs,
this is a direct violation

33
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,307
of the general's protocols.

34
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,809
I know, I know.

35
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:06,519
But something
is happening here.

36
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,146
Something important.

37
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,314
Oh, fuck.

38
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,983
We know what happens next.

39
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,734
She kicks their ass.

40
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,675
Now she makes a call.

41
00:03:37,758 --> 00:03:39,010
The line was traced.

42
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,345
- And then...
- Then she runs for her life.

43
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,763
Are there any agents?

44
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,265
We know this story.

45
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,435
This is how it all began.

46
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,979
God damn it.

47
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:51,522
This is where he began.

48
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:54,859
You're thinking this Modal
is a loop? Or a treadmill?

49
00:03:54,942 --> 00:03:58,487
Some sort of sequencer
evolving a program to do what?

50
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,739
I don't know.

51
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:02,533
But I'm going to find out.

52
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:03,743
All right.

53
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,734
So deja vu and yet it's
obviously all wrong.

54
00:04:36,817 --> 00:04:38,986
Why use old code
to mirror something new?

55
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,696
I don't know.

56
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,419
If that's supposed
to be Trinity,

57
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,046
that's not what happens.

58
00:04:59,006 --> 00:05:00,966
Maybe this isn't the story
we think it is.

59
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,427
Bugs, you have
to get out of here.

60
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,763
It's gotta be a trap.

61
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,224
Shit.

62
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,263
Uh...

63
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,140
You all carry on.

64
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,224
As you were.

65
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,770
I'm just gonna...

66
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,440
see myself out.

67
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,524
Kill her.

68
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,477
Oh, Seq!

69
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:43,587
- Why did you save me?
- You first.

70
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,422
Who are you?
Where did you come from?

71
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,049
Okay.

72
00:07:47,132 --> 00:07:48,884
My name is Bugs.

73
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,262
As in "Bunny."

74
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,055
And tech that listens.

75
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:56,100
Do you know this is a Modal?

76
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,477
What's a Modal?

77
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,854
It's a simulation
used to evolve programs.

78
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,610
Do you understand
that you are...

79
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,196
digital sentience?

80
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,948
I know what I am.

81
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:12,283
Just like I know my job

82
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,451
is to hunt down
and destroy synthients.

83
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,786
Like you.

84
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,500
And yet...

85
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,587
Here we are.

86
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,088
Here we are.

87
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,842
The other agents
don't know about this room?

88
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:32,970
How'd you find it?

89
00:08:33,053 --> 00:08:35,556
No one was ever
in the key shop,

90
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,849
so I started looking.

91
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,102
More you looked,
the more you found.

92
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,730
Story of my life.

93
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:50,863
What?

94
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,617
I feel like I know this room.

95
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,669
Holy shit.

96
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,506
This is his apartment.

97
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,843
You mean Thomas Anderson's?

98
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:14,887
I searched everywhere.
He doesn't exist.

99
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,222
He stopped being Thomas
a long time ago,

100
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,683
but maybe you know him
by his real name.

101
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,518
Neo.

102
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:24,229
You do.

103
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,899
Oh, okay.

104
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:28,859
Uh...

105
00:09:28,942 --> 00:09:31,570
I can't believe this,
after all these years.

106
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:35,324
You see, most people
think that Neo is dead.

107
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,077
But I know he's not.

108
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,788
Because I've seen him.

109
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,833
Where?

110
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,461
It's not something
I can explain easily, but...

111
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,094
<i>But the moment
he looked at me,</i>

112
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,804
I felt something...

113
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,850
unlock my mind.

114
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,479
Okay.

115
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,733
Something like that
happened to me.

116
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,323
<i>I saw this pattern...</i>

117
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:19,034
<i>and it was everywhere.</i>

118
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,038
We can't see it,
but we're all trapped inside

119
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,666
these strange,
repeating loops.

120
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:29,002
Somehow I saw it
in the mirror.

121
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,839
Just a flicker,
but it was like you said.

122
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:39,722
And suddenly I understood.

123
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,266
This is not the real world.

124
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:48,063
<i>For the first time,
I felt real purpose.</i>

125
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,691
I knew who I was

126
00:10:50,774 --> 00:10:52,693
and what I had to do.

127
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,778
Who are you?

128
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,823
What do you have to do?

129
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:02,077
I am...

130
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,246
Morpheus.

131
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:07,666
And I have to find Neo.

132
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,172
Morpheus.

133
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,760
Okay. Okay.

134
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,927
Oh, my God!

135
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,304
I have to get you out of here.

136
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:22,806
I need to figure out
who built this Modal.

137
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,475
Okay, come with me.

138
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,685
You have to be ready to leave.
You have to be really ready.

139
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,061
And if you're not,

140
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,146
if you think that
this is where you belong...

141
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:34,067
You call this a choice?

142
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,652
Oh, honestly, when somebody
offered me these things,

143
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,237
I went off on binary
conceptions of the world

144
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,906
and said there was no way
I was swallowing

145
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,866
some symbolic reduction
of my life.

146
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:42,284
And the woman
with the pills laughed

147
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:43,535
'cause I was
missing the point.

148
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,162
What point?

149
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:48,165
The choice is an illusion.

150
00:11:48,248 --> 00:11:50,459
You already know
what you have to do.

151
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,300
Truth.

152
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,016
Okay.

153
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:07,309
There's an old building

154
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:08,977
with a skylight
and lots of stairs.

155
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,270
The Lafayette.

156
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,897
One of the four back doors
leads there.

157
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,857
Oh.

158
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,442
- Don't fight it.
- Whoa, what's happening?

159
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,610
Keep breathing.

160
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:18,070
Extraction works
pretty much the same

161
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:20,072
for humans and programs.

162
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,909
Ouch.

163
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:25,035
Ah.

164
00:12:26,453 --> 00:12:27,746
Okay.

165
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,708
- Hey.
- Hey.

166
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,585
I've never worn
different glasses before.

167
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,421
Yeah, looks good.
Which door?

168
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,298
- It's gotta be...
- Okay.

169
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,055
Agent White.

170
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:46,348
Agent Smith?

171
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,522
Go!

172
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:02,406
Seq! Can you hear me?

173
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:03,740
Bugs! I thought I lost you.

174
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,075
Can you get us
to the window pane?

175
00:13:05,158 --> 00:13:07,119
Bugs! Bugs! He's an agent!

176
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,548
That window! Go hard!

177
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,221
What the...

178
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,480
What the hell?

179
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,665
Something wrong?

180
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,501
Uh... Just a little crash.

181
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:39,962
Morning, Bobbi. Morning, dude.

182
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,840
What a beautiful day
to be alive. Am I right?

183
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,926
- Problemo?
- He lost something.

184
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,553
Is this old <i>Matrix</i> code?

185
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:52,140
A little Modal experiment.

186
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,185
For <i>Binary?</i>

187
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:57,896
- I need a coffee.
- Coffee. Yes, stat!

188
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,106
I'm buying.

189
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,860
I'm not trying to blow
smoke up your ass,

190
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:08,365
but the first time I played
the trilogy, I was shook.

191
00:15:08,448 --> 00:15:11,034
The paradox
between free will and destiny.

192
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,285
Are we all just algorithms

193
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,578
doing what we're
supposed to do

194
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,372
or can we escape
our programming?

195
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:19,376
Genius, inside the context
of the game, BT dubs.

196
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:21,545
Hey, did I tell you
it took over my life?

197
00:15:21,628 --> 00:15:24,381
Yeah. I failed
the seventh grade.

198
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:26,633
Your game almost ruined me.

199
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,219
- So you've said.
- Yet here we are.

200
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:32,139
You tell me, Mr. Anderson,

201
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,265
is it free will

202
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,143
or destiny?

203
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,733
Oh, yeah.

204
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,735
There she is.

205
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,319
Total f-ing MILF.

206
00:15:47,195 --> 00:15:49,281
Daggers. Look, I'm sorry.

207
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:51,658
I'm a geek.
I was raised by machines.

208
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,993
Maybe you should go.

209
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:56,121
No, please.
I... I promise, best self.

210
00:15:56,204 --> 00:15:57,456
Best self.

211
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:02,627
Sure.

212
00:16:03,503 --> 00:16:04,921
You ever talk to her?

213
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,467
Tell you what.

214
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,929
For all you've done for me,
let me do this for you.

215
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,766
Jude, no. Stop.

216
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,559
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Thanks.

217
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:19,061
Hi. Um...

218
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,729
I know this is all
a bit extemporaneous.

219
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,439
I'm Jude Gallagher.

220
00:16:22,522 --> 00:16:25,108
I work for a game company
called Deus Machina.

221
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,443
Hi, Jude, I'm Tiffany.

222
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:29,446
Tiffany. Wow.
Didn't see that coming.

223
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:31,448
- Mom loved Audrey Hepburn.
- Jude.

224
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:35,452
Oh, and this is my very
good friend, Thomas Anderson.

225
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:37,454
He is a bona fide
famous person

226
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:38,914
and considered by most to be

227
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:40,999
the greatest game designer
of our generation.

228
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,292
I'm sorry about this.

229
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,585
- Jude...
- Just talk to her.

230
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:46,171
Hi, Thomas.
Everyone calls me "Tiff."

231
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,256
Hi.

232
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,556
Have we met?

233
00:16:58,016 --> 00:17:00,143
Uh, we both come here.

234
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,645
- Can I have your morning bun?
- Hey!

235
00:17:01,728 --> 00:17:03,146
Are you trying
to ball my mom or what?

236
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,523
Brandon!

237
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,483
Can I have one bite?

238
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:09,569
Babe! What's going on?
We're gonna be late.

239
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,571
This is my husband, Chad.

240
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,448
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

241
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,160
Babe, we gotta get
Callie to practice.

242
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,329
Right. Sorry.

243
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,039
Come on, kids. Let's move out.

244
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,398
What?

245
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,199
Sorry. Uh, it's the boss.

246
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:05,208
"Billions of people
just living out their lives...

247
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,253
oblivious."

248
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:12,591
I always loved that line.

249
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,134
You wrote that one, yeah?

250
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,014
Every time I stand here,

251
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:22,350
I mean, O-M-G.

252
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,477
It's so perfect,
it's gotta be fake.

253
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,938
Right?

254
00:18:28,815 --> 00:18:30,066
Yeah.

255
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:32,068
Sure.

256
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,987
Have a seat.

257
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,200
Smoke?

258
00:18:39,492 --> 00:18:40,535
I thought you quit.

259
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,788
I quit calling it a habit.

260
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,790
Now it's just
a guilty pleasure.

261
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:51,546
Oh. Maybe I can make this
easy for you.

262
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,673
I know <i>Binary</i> is over budget.

263
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,051
This is not about <i>Binary,</i> Tom.
It's bigger than that.

264
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,469
This is about our future,

265
00:18:57,552 --> 00:19:00,513
which is a sticky subject,
given our past.

266
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,806
What do you mean?

267
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,518
How's the therapy?

268
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:05,894
Good.

269
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,063
Any...

270
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,357
episodes?

271
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,235
No.

272
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,654
That's terrific.

273
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,867
Look, Tom, I know we've
always had our differences.

274
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,786
What did you say
about our first meeting?

275
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:26,122
We had all the chemistry
of an FBI interrogation.

276
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,252
But look at this place.

277
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,671
We did this.

278
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,257
Together.

279
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,093
Yeah.

280
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,136
Now what?

281
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,807
Things have changed.
The market's tough.

282
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,184
I'm sure you can understand
why our beloved

283
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,644
parent company, Warner Bros.,

284
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:50,146
has decided to make
a sequel to the trilogy.

285
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,648
What?

286
00:19:51,731 --> 00:19:53,650
They informed me they're gonna
do it with or without us.

287
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,568
I thought
they couldn't do that.

288
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,154
Oh, they can.

289
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,572
And they made it clear

290
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,825
they'll kill our contract
if we don't cooperate.

291
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:03,618
Really?

292
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,580
I know you said the story
was over for you,

293
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,833
but that's the thing
about stories.

294
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:13,545
They never really end,
do they?

295
00:20:13,628 --> 00:20:16,172
We're still telling the same
stories we've always told,

296
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:20,552
just with different names,
different faces

297
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:25,265
and I have to say
I'm kind of excited.

298
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,269
After all these years,

299
00:20:29,352 --> 00:20:32,355
to be going back
to where it all started.

300
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,774
Back to <i>The Matrix.</i>

301
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,610
I've spoken to Marketing...

302
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,118
Tom?

303
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:46,745
Yeah.

304
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:47,871
Are you all right?

305
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:51,333
Yeah.

306
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:58,465
What were you feeling
at that point?

307
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,345
What was I feeling?

308
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:11,394
I felt either I'm having
a mental breakdown again

309
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:15,732
or I'm living inside
a computer-generated reality

310
00:21:15,815 --> 00:21:17,359
that has imprisoned me...

311
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:19,152
again.

312
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:31,331
Not much of a choice.

313
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:32,624
No.

314
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:34,292
Maybe it's not
as binary as that.

315
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,670
Maybe there are other ways
to understand what happened.

316
00:21:38,254 --> 00:21:39,339
Yeah.

317
00:21:39,422 --> 00:21:41,591
Thomas, you are
a suicide survivor

318
00:21:41,674 --> 00:21:44,552
gifted with
a powerful imagination.

319
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,388
Those facts have combined

320
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,973
to create dangerous fictions
in your life.

321
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,600
Yesterday,
you walked into a meeting

322
00:21:50,683 --> 00:21:51,810
with your business partner

323
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,353
and he ambushed you,

324
00:21:53,436 --> 00:21:55,855
demanding you make a game
you said you would never make.

325
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:59,275
This attack effectively
took away your voice.

326
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,112
His violence triggered you
and your mind fought back.

327
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,072
You did to him
what he was doing to you.

328
00:22:05,573 --> 00:22:06,950
We've talked about the value

329
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:10,578
of adaptive anger
in healing trauma.

330
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:14,040
Far from suggesting a repeat
of your initial breakdown,

331
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,333
I believe this episode

332
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,210
demonstrates healthy
self-protection.

333
00:22:18,753 --> 00:22:20,964
And more importantly,
I remember how hard

334
00:22:21,047 --> 00:22:24,092
it was for you
to share something like this.

335
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:26,886
Which tells me
just how far we've come.

336
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:34,269
Do you need a refill
on your prescription?

337
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,313
Yeah.

338
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,130
First of all, I know
I speak for everyone

339
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:04,507
when I say that
I'm so, so excited

340
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,676
to be working on a game
that was such a...

341
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:08,845
well, game changer.

342
00:23:08,928 --> 00:23:10,513
Now, the packet
in front of you

343
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,391
has our focus group research.

344
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,934
Inside, you'll find
the breakdown

345
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,854
including keyword association
with the brand.

346
00:23:17,937 --> 00:23:21,024
The top two being
"originality" and "fresh,"

347
00:23:21,107 --> 00:23:23,151
which I think are great things
to keep in mind

348
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:25,445
as you begin
working on <i>Matrix 4.</i>

349
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,573
And who knows how many more?

350
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:47,509
What made <i>Matrix</i> different?
It effed with your head.

351
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,885
On point.

352
00:23:48,968 --> 00:23:50,970
People want us
up in their grey space,

353
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:54,098
switching their synaptic
"WTF" light on.

354
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,569
What made <i>Matrix</i> different?
It effed with your head.

355
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,488
People want us
up in their grey space,

356
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:09,906
switching their synaptic

357
00:24:09,989 --> 00:24:12,617
"What the hell
is going on here?" light on.

358
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:26,923
I didn't love the first one,
like some of you.

359
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:29,425
And, frankly,
I've got zero tolerance

360
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,928
for anything that requires
a syllabus and a highlighter.

361
00:24:32,011 --> 00:24:33,888
I like my games big,
loud and dumb.

362
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,932
We need guns! Lots of guns.

363
00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:38,601
<i>Matrix</i> means mayhem.

364
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,441
Mindless action
is not on-brand.

365
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,943
She's right.

366
00:24:47,026 --> 00:24:50,071
<i>Matrix</i> is mind-porn.
Philosophy in shiny...

367
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:51,823
- tight PVC.
- Yeah.

368
00:24:51,906 --> 00:24:53,783
Ideas are the new "sexy."

369
00:25:07,922 --> 00:25:09,632
Obviously
<i>The Matrix</i> is about...

370
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,968
- ...trans-politics.
- Crypto-fascism.

371
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:12,969
It's a metaphor...

372
00:25:13,052 --> 00:25:14,721
...of capitalist exploitation.

373
00:25:27,191 --> 00:25:31,571
This cannot be another reboot,
retread, regurgitated...

374
00:25:31,654 --> 00:25:33,740
Why not? Reboots sell.

375
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,870
We are so far down the wrong
rabbit hole, here, people.

376
00:25:38,953 --> 00:25:42,790
You say <i>Matrix</i> to anyone...
You say <i>Matrix...</i>

377
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,835
Matrix...
Matrix... Matrix...

378
00:25:45,918 --> 00:25:47,754
...this is what they see.

379
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,721
Allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word.

380
00:25:56,804 --> 00:25:58,973
Bullet time! Bullet time!

381
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,683
That's two words.

382
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:07,857
We need
a new "bullet time."

383
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:14,364
We need to revolutionize
gaming again.

384
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:18,242
Revolutionize gaming
again!

385
00:26:44,143 --> 00:26:45,895
<i>Afternoon, Tiff.</i>

386
00:26:45,978 --> 00:26:47,146
The ushe?

387
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,399
You know what, Skroce?
I'm going wild.

388
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,984
I'll have a cortado today.

389
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,612
Fly that freak flag.

390
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,447
Mind if I get that?

391
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,573
Oh, hi.

392
00:26:58,574 --> 00:27:00,576
Hi.

393
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,162
I remember
wanting a family,

394
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,539
but was that because

395
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:07,291
that's what women
are supposed to want?

396
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,085
How do you know
if you want something yourself

397
00:27:09,168 --> 00:27:12,296
or if your upbringing
programmed you to want it?

398
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,381
Mmm.

399
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,384
I pay my analyst
a lot of money

400
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:19,053
to answer
such questions for me.

401
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,346
Smart.

402
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,639
I should get more therapy

403
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,142
but honestly,
I'm too goddamn tired.

404
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,977
Kids are exhausting, you know?

405
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,814
No. Never had kids.

406
00:27:29,897 --> 00:27:32,650
Oh, right, I knew that.

407
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,194
Sorry. I googled you.

408
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,741
So, what's it like being
a world-famous game designer?

409
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,368
- Must be amazing.
- Uh...

410
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,953
A lot of hours.

411
00:27:44,036 --> 00:27:46,080
Sometimes it is amazing.

412
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,665
Most times...

413
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,168
I don't know.

414
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,754
But you made <i>The Matrix.</i>
Even I've heard of that.

415
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:56,632
Yeah. We kept
some kids entertained.

416
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,843
So, worth it?

417
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,769
Can I ask something
about your game?

418
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,103
Sure.

419
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,439
Did you base your
main character on yourself?

420
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,571
There is a lot of me in him.

421
00:28:21,073 --> 00:28:24,243
Maybe a little too much.

422
00:28:26,245 --> 00:28:27,997
Can I ask you something else?

423
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,290
Please.

424
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,294
There's a woman in your game.

425
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,505
Trinity.

426
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,092
Which is a weird
coincidence also, right?

427
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:42,762
God, yeah.

428
00:28:44,138 --> 00:28:45,389
I like her.

429
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,893
- I like Trinity.
- Ah.

430
00:28:48,976 --> 00:28:50,228
And I dig her Ducati.

431
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:53,314
Another coincidence.
I love motorcycles.

432
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,320
My friend Kush and I
actually build them.

433
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:00,530
Really?

434
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,991
You have your analyst,
I have my bikes.

435
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:08,704
So, I was looking at images
from your game. At Trinity.

436
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:11,999
Well, I showed Chad a scene,

437
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,126
and I was like,
"So, what do you think?"

438
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,713
He didn't get it until I said,

439
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,799
"Don't you think
she looks like me?"

440
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,344
You know what he did?

441
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,930
He laughed.

442
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,521
And I laughed too,
like it was a joke.

443
00:29:33,604 --> 00:29:35,147
How could it not be, right?

444
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,985
Made me so angry.

445
00:29:40,486 --> 00:29:42,822
I hated myself for laughing.

446
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:47,577
I wanted to kick him so hard.

447
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,162
Not too hard.

448
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:53,457
Maybe just hard enough
to break his jaw off.

449
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,504
And right now,
you're probably regretting

450
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,089
sitting down with me.

451
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:06,137
This is the best thing
I've done in a long time.

452
00:30:10,516 --> 00:30:12,226
I have to take this.

453
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:16,939
Hi, this is Tiff.

454
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,107
Oh, God, no.

455
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,153
I'll be right there.

456
00:30:22,236 --> 00:30:25,072
My, uh, youngest
stuck a Lego up his nose.

457
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,241
Oh.

458
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:29,702
I gotta go.

459
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,498
I hope I see you again.

460
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,559
<i>There has been a report</i>

461
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,144
<i>of an emergency.</i>

462
00:30:55,227 --> 00:30:57,146
<i>Proceed calmly
to the nearest exit</i>

463
00:30:57,229 --> 00:30:59,273
<i>and leave the building
immediately.</i>

464
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,733
What's going on?

465
00:31:00,816 --> 00:31:02,652
We probably just got swatted
by some 14-year-old.

466
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,320
Yeah, someone pissed
about the latest update.

467
00:31:04,403 --> 00:31:05,821
Or they're just a dick.

468
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,658
Please move to the exits.
Building's being evacuated.

469
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,597
Sir, this way.

470
00:31:37,436 --> 00:31:38,604
Jude?

471
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,190
Jude!

472
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,615
At last.

473
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,702
Ah.

474
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,245
I wasn't too sure
about the callback,

475
00:31:54,328 --> 00:31:56,330
but, you know,
it was hard to resist.

476
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,540
What?

477
00:31:57,623 --> 00:31:59,041
Morpheus Uno.
Reveal at the window.

478
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,585
Lightning,
thunder and theater.

479
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,546
At last.

480
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:06,048
All these years later,
here's me,

481
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,384
strolling out
of a toilet stall.

482
00:32:08,467 --> 00:32:09,593
Tragedy or farce?

483
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,303
I know you.

484
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,389
Not every day
you meet your maker.

485
00:32:13,472 --> 00:32:14,640
This can't be happening.

486
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,392
Oh, most definitely is.

487
00:32:16,475 --> 00:32:18,936
You can't be
a character I coded.

488
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,063
100% natural.

489
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,739
How?

490
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,991
All the explanation you need.

491
00:32:35,202 --> 00:32:36,829
Oh.

492
00:32:36,912 --> 00:32:38,080
No.

493
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,915
No, no, no.

494
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,792
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean, "no"?

495
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,503
You wanted this, you did this.
This was your idea.

496
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:48,924
It was a test. An experiment.

497
00:32:50,217 --> 00:32:51,427
An experiment?

498
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,930
You put me
in a tiny-ass Modal,

499
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,390
left me to bang my head till

500
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,726
I nearly lost my shit
searching for you

501
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:00,311
as an experiment.

502
00:33:00,394 --> 00:33:02,396
- The exit's breaking down.
- He hasn't taken the pill.

503
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,814
What? There's no time.

504
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,941
I know, I know.
He's having a moment.

505
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,486
Does he know how hard it was
to hack that mirror?

506
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:12,448
Still open.

507
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:15,951
This... This can't be real.

508
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,870
Target acquired.
We got him.

509
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,796
This isn't happening.

510
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,340
It's in my mind.
It's in my mind.

511
00:33:29,423 --> 00:33:30,633
Hey, you!
Stop! Hold it!

512
00:33:46,732 --> 00:33:48,275
This can't be happening.

513
00:33:51,403 --> 00:33:53,155
Freeze! Don't move!

514
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,249
Neo!

515
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,557
Oh, my God!

516
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,384
Neo!

517
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,474
Mr. Anderson!

518
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,560
No!

519
00:35:04,643 --> 00:35:05,686
It can't be.

520
00:35:14,486 --> 00:35:16,322
I've missed you.

521
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,255
It's in my mind.

522
00:35:34,381 --> 00:35:35,758
It's in my mind.

523
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,434
Can you hear me, Thomas?

524
00:35:46,685 --> 00:35:49,480
Follow my voice.

525
00:35:49,563 --> 00:35:53,275
Feel the tips of your fingers.
What are they touching?

526
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,695
The bell.

527
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,616
Do you hear the bell?

528
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:07,081
Do you remember what happened?
How you got here?

529
00:36:08,707 --> 00:36:10,000
You must have walked.

530
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,293
I heard Deja Vu outside,

531
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,628
opened my door,
and there you were.

532
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,803
You feel like
you can talk about it?

533
00:36:20,886 --> 00:36:22,137
When we started
working together,

534
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,973
you had lost your capacity

535
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:26,600
to discern reality
from fiction.

536
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,853
You came to me after
trying to jump off a building.

537
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,231
You said you wanted
to fly away.

538
00:36:45,577 --> 00:36:48,330
We have made
a lot of progress since then,

539
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,749
but you seem particularly
triggered right now.

540
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,293
Can you tell me
how it started?

541
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,005
He texted me.

542
00:36:57,172 --> 00:36:58,507
Who?

543
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,050
Morpheus.

544
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,218
Ah.

545
00:37:02,928 --> 00:37:04,305
So, he's back.

546
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,557
It wasn't actually him.

547
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:11,020
It was a program
I coded for a Modal.

548
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,272
And this "Modal," Morpheus,

549
00:37:13,355 --> 00:37:15,357
came to help you escape

550
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:19,069
from a virtual reality
called <i>The Matrix.</i>

551
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,165
Am I crazy?

552
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:33,709
We don't use that word
in here.

553
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:36,712
What word should I use?

554
00:37:36,795 --> 00:37:40,132
What word explains
what is happening to me?

555
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:41,884
Can I see the texts?

556
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,888
They were erased.

557
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:54,480
If we got in my car
and drove to your office,

558
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,523
what do you think
we'd find there?

559
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,649
Nothing.

560
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,446
Because there was no attack.

561
00:38:03,655 --> 00:38:05,240
No one was killed.

562
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,285
No one texted.

563
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,412
My mind made it all up.

564
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,500
Is that what
I'm supposed to say?

565
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,085
Is that what you believe?

566
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,754
It felt real.

567
00:38:18,837 --> 00:38:20,589
Of course.

568
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:23,592
It was your great ambition
to make a game

569
00:38:23,675 --> 00:38:26,053
that was indistinguishable
from reality.

570
00:38:26,136 --> 00:38:27,596
To achieve this goal,

571
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:30,140
you converted elements
of your life into narrative.

572
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,476
Your sublimated anger
toward your business partner

573
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:34,770
cast him as your nemesis.

574
00:38:34,853 --> 00:38:36,480
A married woman named Tiffany

575
00:38:36,563 --> 00:38:39,900
became the "Trinity"
of a doomed romance.

576
00:38:39,983 --> 00:38:44,154
Even your dislike of my cat
made it into your <i>Matrix.</i>

577
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,031
There's nothing wrong
with that.

578
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,574
It's what artists do.

579
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:51,036
But it becomes a problem
when fantasies

580
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,455
endanger us or other people.

581
00:38:55,707 --> 00:38:58,085
We don't want anyone
to get hurt,

582
00:38:58,168 --> 00:38:59,545
do we, Thomas?

583
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,763
Hi, Thomas.
Everyone calls me "Tiff."

584
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,266
- Who are you?
- My name is Trinity.

585
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:13,976
<i>No one can tell you
you're in love.</i>

586
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:16,562
You just know it,
through and through.

587
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:19,148
Balls to bones.

588
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,024
<i>You feel this?</i>

589
00:39:22,734 --> 00:39:24,445
I'm never letting go.

590
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,163
<i>You have
to let it all go, Neo.</i>

591
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,623
Free your mind.

592
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,852
Huh.

593
00:39:56,935 --> 00:39:58,937
Looks easy enough.

594
00:40:05,777 --> 00:40:08,405
"Free my mind." Shit.

595
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,621
Okay.

596
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,122
Free my mind.

597
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,890
I fly...

598
00:40:35,807 --> 00:40:37,726
or I fall.

599
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,777
Who the hell are you?

600
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,738
You won't remember me,

601
00:40:49,821 --> 00:40:53,075
but a long time ago,
you changed my life

602
00:40:53,158 --> 00:40:55,536
when you leapt off
another roof.

603
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,539
<i>Back then, I was just like
any other coppertop,</i>

604
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,332
<i>pretending my life...</i>

605
00:41:00,415 --> 00:41:04,545
until I looked up
and I saw you.

606
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,130
<i>It was a different you,
but I saw</i>

607
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,675
the real you,

608
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,552
just a second before...

609
00:41:13,011 --> 00:41:14,096
you leapt.

610
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,644
And you never fell.

611
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:28,110
Are you the one
that hacked my Modal?

612
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:29,695
Yeah.

613
00:41:31,196 --> 00:41:32,739
That'll be Jude.

614
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,157
He's not your friend.

615
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,701
He's a handle,
a program used to control you.

616
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:36,827
He's on his way here,

617
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,745
and he's bringing
Agents with him.

618
00:41:40,205 --> 00:41:41,456
Jude.

619
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,958
<i>Bro, I've been calling you
all night.</i>

620
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:44,751
<i>We have a major problemo.</i>

621
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,879
Are you alone?

622
00:41:50,632 --> 00:41:53,427
<i>That's kind
of a sexy question, dude.</i>

623
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,804
They don't look like
typical Agents.

624
00:41:55,887 --> 00:41:57,306
They use bots now,
skinned as normal people,

625
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,515
which means they're everywhere

626
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,851
and you never know
who to trust.

627
00:42:00,934 --> 00:42:02,686
Why should I trust you?

628
00:42:04,771 --> 00:42:07,858
Because if they open
that door, we lose our hack.

629
00:42:07,941 --> 00:42:09,651
I will be caught and killed

630
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:10,944
and you will be put right back

631
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,279
on that treadmill
they designed for you,

632
00:42:12,362 --> 00:42:13,488
just like they did
the last time

633
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:14,740
you tried to leap
your way out.

634
00:42:16,074 --> 00:42:18,493
I know why you left
your Modal open.

635
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:21,038
You needed someone else
to free Morpheus.

636
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,165
And it's because of him that
we were able to get to you.

637
00:42:23,248 --> 00:42:25,125
I know these things
the same way

638
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:27,961
that I knew one day
I would find you.

639
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,672
And that when I did,
you would be ready for this.

640
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,637
If you want the truth, Neo,

641
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,890
you're going
to have to follow me.

642
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:42,434
Okay.

643
00:43:01,953 --> 00:43:04,581
- Where are we?
- Tokyo.

644
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,500
A moving portal
makes it harder to track us.

645
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:09,211
- Seq is the best of them.
- Portal's clean.

646
00:43:09,294 --> 00:43:10,712
Reading our shadows.

647
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,716
I don't remember this.

648
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,094
We don't have to run to
phone booths anymore, either.

649
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,146
Door's on your right.

650
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,746
Set and setting, right?

651
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,123
Oh, no.

652
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,666
It's all about set

653
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,751
and setting.

654
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,962
After our first contact
went so badly,

655
00:43:52,045 --> 00:43:53,922
we thought elements
from your past

656
00:43:54,005 --> 00:43:55,507
might help ease you
into the present.

657
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:58,427
Nothing comforts anxiety like

658
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,928
a little nostalgia.

659
00:44:00,011 --> 00:44:02,347
This is footage
from your game.

660
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,565
Time is
always against us,

661
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,484
etcetera, etcetera.

662
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:16,820
No one can be told

663
00:44:16,903 --> 00:44:20,198
what the Matrix is,
blah, blah, blah.

664
00:44:22,784 --> 00:44:24,745
You gotta see it
to believe it.

665
00:44:28,373 --> 00:44:29,958
Time to fly.

666
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,462
Wait.

667
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:34,796
If this is real,

668
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,507
if I haven't lost my mind,
does that mean

669
00:44:39,217 --> 00:44:40,594
this happened?

670
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,062
But if it did...

671
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,735
then we died.

672
00:44:56,818 --> 00:44:58,737
Obviously not.

673
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,238
Why the Machines
kept you alive

674
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:03,200
and why they went
to such lengths to hide you

675
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:05,118
are questions
we don't have answers to.

676
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,787
Hide me?

677
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:11,166
I've been at a company making
a game called <i>The Matrix.</i>

678
00:45:11,249 --> 00:45:13,835
Doesn't seem like they were
trying to hide anything.

679
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,462
We've been tracking
that company for years.

680
00:45:15,545 --> 00:45:18,340
We screened every
Thomas Anderson we found.

681
00:45:18,423 --> 00:45:20,008
What we didn't understand

682
00:45:20,091 --> 00:45:22,594
was that they could
alter your DSI.

683
00:45:22,677 --> 00:45:24,429
Pods generate
your digital self-image

684
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:27,015
through a feedback system
called Semblance.

685
00:45:27,098 --> 00:45:29,100
This is how
you look to yourself.

686
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:32,896
Somehow they were able
to alter your DSI loop.

687
00:45:32,979 --> 00:45:35,482
This is how
everyone else sees you.

688
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:51,540
Twenty years?

689
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:56,378
Why did it take 20 years
to find me?

690
00:45:56,461 --> 00:45:58,296
It took a lot longer
than that.

691
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,382
It's been over 60 years
since you and Trinity

692
00:46:00,465 --> 00:46:02,217
flew to one
of the Machine Cities.

693
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:03,885
What?

694
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,179
There's so much we don't know.

695
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,014
Like why you've barely aged,

696
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,308
or how many times
they've altered your DSI.

697
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,726
But based on
what we do know,

698
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,144
it appears no one found you

699
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:15,063
because you didn't
want to be found.

700
00:46:15,146 --> 00:46:17,899
- That's not true.
- Maybe it isn't.

701
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,192
Maybe there's no foundation

702
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,443
to the rumors
that you disappeared,

703
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:21,695
because you were working

704
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:23,196
with the Machines
from the beginning.

705
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,406
Morpheus, stop.

706
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:27,617
All I'm saying is
this is the moment

707
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:30,245
for you to show us
what is real.

708
00:46:30,328 --> 00:46:32,539
If you want out,

709
00:46:32,622 --> 00:46:33,999
you'll take this pill.

710
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,919
But if you are
where you belong,

711
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,172
you can go back to this.

712
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,590
Every day.

713
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:45,302
Over and over forever.

714
00:46:48,763 --> 00:46:49,973
Fuck.

715
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,192
Keep the loop tight.

716
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:14,789
Cybebe needs
that tower pin.

717
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,750
I got a signal. It's faint.

718
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:18,293
It's definitely off-grid.

719
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,594
Captain. I'm tracking
a whole lot of weird.

720
00:47:27,677 --> 00:47:29,137
- What?
- It's some kind of graft.

721
00:47:35,393 --> 00:47:36,686
Thomas?

722
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:39,648
Oh, God.

723
00:47:40,273 --> 00:47:41,983
Oh, no.

724
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,487
- We got company.
- How'd they find us?

725
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,658
Thomas, none of this is real.

726
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:53,954
You are in the midst
of a serious psychotic break.

727
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,122
- Lexy?
- Almost there.

728
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,291
Thomas?

729
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,211
Thomas, please.
This is not a game.

730
00:48:01,294 --> 00:48:02,796
Feel my hand.

731
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:04,089
This is what is real.

732
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,885
Stay with me.

733
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,595
No. No.

734
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:14,683
Stay with me.

735
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:18,353
Neo!

736
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,066
Morpheus!

737
00:48:24,609 --> 00:48:26,027
Let's go, let's go!

738
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,518
- Bots are being activated.
- It's a swarm.

739
00:49:22,667 --> 00:49:23,752
Come on!

740
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,703
I got a hack
in the bathroom. Hurry!

741
00:49:58,787 --> 00:49:59,788
Yes.

742
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,581
Come on!

743
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:04,667
Seq, where?

744
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,463
- That mirror.
- What?

745
00:50:08,546 --> 00:50:10,298
- We'll never fit.
- You gotta fit,

746
00:50:10,381 --> 00:50:11,758
'cause I don't have
another way off this train.

747
00:50:11,841 --> 00:50:12,842
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

748
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,386
No, no, no.

749
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,638
Think "perspective."

750
00:50:16,721 --> 00:50:18,515
Closer you are,
bigger it gets.

751
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,728
Okay, come on.

752
00:50:24,979 --> 00:50:26,147
In you go.

753
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:22,388
Trinity.

754
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:28,728
No!

755
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,562
Welcome back
to the real world.

756
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,280
Trinity.

757
00:54:02,363 --> 00:54:03,489
- What's up, Doc?
- His vital systems

758
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,033
have been
meticulously maintained,

759
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:06,993
but it doesn't look good.

760
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,751
- We're losing him.
- Cold boot could shock him.

761
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,377
Do it.

762
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:30,975
I remember this.

763
00:54:33,644 --> 00:54:35,188
The Construct.

764
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,608
In between everything

765
00:54:38,691 --> 00:54:40,818
and nothing.

766
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:42,570
Welcome to the Crib.

767
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,199
I've been chilling here
in the ship network...

768
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:51,204
learning all about you.

769
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,043
And me.

770
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,717
Careful. It'll do your head in.

771
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:08,346
Are memories turned
into fiction any less real?

772
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:14,769
Is reality based in memory
nothing but fiction?

773
00:55:14,852 --> 00:55:18,106
As to my role in all this,
my best guess

774
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,482
is that you wrote me

775
00:55:19,565 --> 00:55:21,609
as an algorithmic reflection
of two forces

776
00:55:21,692 --> 00:55:24,195
that helped you become you,

777
00:55:24,278 --> 00:55:27,740
Morpheus and Agent Smith.

778
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:28,950
A combo pack

779
00:55:29,033 --> 00:55:31,536
of counterprogramming
that was...

780
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:38,167
Let's just say, more than
a little bit crazy-making.

781
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:41,170
But it worked
because here we are.

782
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,798
Now, for the bad news.

783
00:55:43,881 --> 00:55:46,092
Your brain
is hooked on this shit

784
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:49,053
the Matrix has been
force-feeding you for years.

785
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,805
Hooked bad.

786
00:55:50,888 --> 00:55:52,390
You're going through
major withdrawals.

787
00:55:52,473 --> 00:55:55,685
Docbots are giving you
crap odds for surviving.

788
00:55:55,768 --> 00:55:58,020
But, see,
they don't know you like I do.

789
00:56:00,898 --> 00:56:03,109
I know exactly what you need.

790
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,674
You gotta be kidding.

791
00:56:26,757 --> 00:56:27,800
Uh-uh.

792
00:56:28,801 --> 00:56:30,595
No joke.

793
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:34,807
Could be this is the first day
of the rest of your life.

794
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,726
But if you want it...

795
00:56:40,354 --> 00:56:41,689
you gotta fight for it.

796
00:56:42,815 --> 00:56:45,776
No. I'm done fighting.

797
00:56:46,819 --> 00:56:47,820
Are you?

798
00:57:31,155 --> 00:57:32,573
What the hell is he doing?

799
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:36,536
Oh, yeah.
They taught you good.

800
00:57:41,999 --> 00:57:45,253
Made you believe their world
was all you deserved.

801
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,255
But some part of you knew
that was a lie.

802
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:50,091
Some part of you remembered
what was real.

803
00:57:52,843 --> 00:57:54,011
You don't know me.

804
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:55,680
No?

805
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:02,645
Ooh.

806
00:58:38,347 --> 00:58:39,974
I know you, because I know

807
00:58:40,057 --> 00:58:41,976
the only thing
that still matters to you.

808
00:58:42,059 --> 00:58:45,229
I know it's why you're here,
why you're still fighting

809
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,897
and why you will
never give up.

810
00:59:01,078 --> 00:59:02,413
Come on, Neo!

811
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:05,041
This is it.

812
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:08,753
This is your last chance.

813
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,179
You gotta fight
for your goddamn life

814
00:59:18,262 --> 00:59:19,597
if you want to see
Trinity again.

815
00:59:24,518 --> 00:59:25,895
Come on, Neo! Fight for her!

816
00:59:28,522 --> 00:59:31,150
- Holy shit.
- Fight for her!

817
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:24,912
- Hey.
- Hey.

818
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,332
Mind if I...

819
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,013
How are you doing?

820
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:46,684
If this plug is actually real,

821
01:00:48,644 --> 01:00:50,980
that means
they took my life...

822
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:55,901
and turned it
into a video game.

823
01:00:59,029 --> 01:01:00,656
How am I doing?

824
01:01:01,615 --> 01:01:03,659
I don't know.

825
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,911
I don't even know how to know.

826
01:01:07,037 --> 01:01:08,497
That's it, isn't it?

827
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,209
If we don't know
what's real...

828
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:15,421
we can't resist.

829
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:19,800
They took your story,

830
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:21,385
something that meant

831
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,722
so much to people like me,

832
01:01:26,348 --> 01:01:29,018
and turned it
into something trivial.

833
01:01:30,811 --> 01:01:32,605
That's what the Matrix does.

834
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,649
It weaponizes every idea.

835
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,818
Every dream.

836
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,113
Everything
that's important to us.

837
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:45,868
Where better to bury truth
than inside something

838
01:01:45,951 --> 01:01:48,996
as ordinary as a video game?

839
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:51,081
That sounds like the Oracle.

840
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,293
Heard so much about her.

841
01:01:57,087 --> 01:01:58,631
She was gone
before I was free.

842
01:02:00,257 --> 01:02:01,675
Gone?

843
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:04,595
When this new version
of the Matrix was uploaded,

844
01:02:06,096 --> 01:02:07,640
there was a purge.

845
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:16,273
They promised peace
and they gave us purge.

846
01:02:17,733 --> 01:02:19,193
No.

847
01:02:19,276 --> 01:02:20,986
No, there was peace.

848
01:02:22,404 --> 01:02:27,535
You made it possible,
and it changed everything.

849
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:31,121
Doesn't feel like
it changed anything.

850
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:34,416
The Matrix is
the same or worse.

851
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,710
And I'm back where I started.

852
01:02:39,463 --> 01:02:41,924
It feels like
everything I did,

853
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:44,468
everything we did...

854
01:02:50,474 --> 01:02:52,685
...like none of it mattered.

855
01:02:54,895 --> 01:02:56,564
All of it mattered.

856
01:02:58,315 --> 01:02:59,817
I can show you.

857
01:03:10,494 --> 01:03:12,079
This is my crew.

858
01:03:15,207 --> 01:03:17,376
Our operator, Seq.

859
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:23,465
Sequoia. But everybody
calls me Seq.

860
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:25,009
Nice to meet you.

861
01:03:26,051 --> 01:03:28,095
Dad loved redwoods.

862
01:03:28,178 --> 01:03:29,430
When he escaped the Matrix

863
01:03:29,513 --> 01:03:31,056
and found out
they no longer existed,

864
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,641
it almost killed him.

865
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:33,934
Lucky, he met Mom

866
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:36,437
and here I am.

867
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:40,232
This is Lexy,
Berg and Ellster.

868
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,109
Hi.

869
01:03:42,192 --> 01:03:44,778
You knew my grandfather,
Captain Roland.

870
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:47,323
Roland was your grandfather?

871
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:49,199
He always laughed,

872
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:50,242
joking how he never
believed in you.

873
01:03:51,368 --> 01:03:52,786
But, in private, he said that

874
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,997
you freed his mind
a second time.

875
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,124
Uh, not to fanboy out here,

876
01:03:57,207 --> 01:03:59,209
but this is kind
of a huge moment for me.

877
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:01,795
Berg is our resident
Neo-ologist.

878
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,088
A what?

879
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:06,216
There's a lot of people
out there like me

880
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,636
who are a little bit
obsessed with your life.

881
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:09,887
I would never have recognized

882
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:11,096
your Modal
if it weren't for him.

883
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:12,431
Whenever
you're feeling up for it,

884
01:04:12,514 --> 01:04:14,475
I've got, like,
a million questions.

885
01:04:14,558 --> 01:04:17,019
Me too. Starting with them.

886
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:19,396
It's okay.

887
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:21,398
Come meet him.

888
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:22,775
This is Cybebe.

889
01:04:22,858 --> 01:04:24,276
That's Octacles.

890
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,029
That's Lumin8.

891
01:04:27,112 --> 01:04:29,365
Machines are on our side now?

892
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:30,658
They are synthients.

893
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:32,409
It's a word
they prefer to "Machines."

894
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:33,827
Your contact
with the Synthient City

895
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:36,288
had a huge impact
on their world.

896
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:37,498
That's what I meant.

897
01:04:37,581 --> 01:04:38,832
What you changed

898
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:40,501
that nobody believed
could ever be changed.

899
01:04:42,419 --> 01:04:44,922
The meaning of "our side."

900
01:04:48,717 --> 01:04:50,552
Cybebe and Octacles
risked their lives

901
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:51,804
to help get you out.

902
01:04:53,263 --> 01:04:54,264
Thank you.

903
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:56,850
But why?

904
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:59,478
Not all seek to control.

905
01:04:59,561 --> 01:05:01,563
Just as not all
wish to be free.

906
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:04,608
What is that?

907
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:06,986
An exomorphic-particle codex.
It's pretty new.

908
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,196
It gives programs
access to this world.

909
01:05:09,279 --> 01:05:10,489
Within limits.

910
01:05:10,572 --> 01:05:13,575
Limits are the domain
of the limited.

911
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,202
Morpheus.

912
01:05:15,285 --> 01:05:16,328
Thank you.

913
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:17,830
It was my honor.

914
01:05:19,623 --> 01:05:20,874
Wow.

915
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:22,126
How does it work?

916
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:23,711
Paramagnetic oscillation.

917
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:24,962
If you want,

918
01:05:25,045 --> 01:05:26,296
I can download
the codex manual for you.

919
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,799
- Sure.
- Downloading used to be fun.

920
01:05:28,882 --> 01:05:31,260
Now it's all manuals
and diagnostics.

921
01:05:31,343 --> 01:05:33,053
Can I ask them something?

922
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:39,226
When you unplugged me,
there was another pod?

923
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:43,439
Yes. We've analyzed the data.

924
01:05:44,648 --> 01:05:45,983
It could be Trinity.

925
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:48,402
It's her.

926
01:05:48,485 --> 01:05:51,572
I figured we were going
to have this conversation.

927
01:05:51,655 --> 01:05:54,575
Look, you were not
a typical flush-and-grab.

928
01:05:54,658 --> 01:05:56,326
You were in this weird tower
that Cybebe

929
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:58,495
had never accessed,
and she's now exiled.

930
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:00,956
We burned
our one shot for you.

931
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,083
Even if it were Trinity
and she wanted to be free,

932
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:05,210
we have no idea how to do it.

933
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,295
Yet.

934
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:11,592
Nobody believed
we'd ever find him,

935
01:06:11,675 --> 01:06:12,718
but we did.

936
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:17,056
Okay.

937
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:20,267
We don't know
how to get her out... yet.

938
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,980
Captain, we're approaching
security clearance.

939
01:06:26,273 --> 01:06:27,441
We're here.

940
01:06:27,524 --> 01:06:28,567
Zion?

941
01:06:36,658 --> 01:06:38,118
Have a seat.

942
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:40,954
This is Hanno.
Best pilot in our fleet.

943
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:41,997
Quite a few synthients

944
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,540
deserve that title before me.

945
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:44,792
Mnemosyne, <i>you are cleared</i>

946
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:46,251
<i>for landing. Welcome home.</i>

947
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,003
Thank you, Control.

948
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,671
Um, we're about to crash.

949
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:57,846
General realized we were

950
01:06:57,930 --> 01:06:59,973
never going to beat
the Sentinels, so...

951
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:02,184
we just got better
at hiding from them.

952
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:08,357
Welcome to Io.

953
01:07:09,983 --> 01:07:11,401
Io.

954
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:20,577
Wow. That looks real.

955
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:22,663
Bio-sky.

956
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,585
Works kind of like
grow lights.

957
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:30,337
It's way more complex
than that.

958
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:32,881
It pulls water from the crust,
hydronating the air.

959
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:36,301
It balances the ECO
and our SRI cycles.

960
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:38,720
Plus...

961
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:41,348
it is pretty to look at.

962
01:07:41,431 --> 01:07:43,225
As opposed to that.

963
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:47,104
I guess the general sent us
a welcome party.

964
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:06,790
God damn.

965
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:09,084
It is you.

966
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,128
Niobe?

967
01:08:12,963 --> 01:08:16,550
A few more wrinkles
and a few less teeth,

968
01:08:16,633 --> 01:08:20,304
but wise enough to know
I don't know anything.

969
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:23,056
I sure as shit
never saw this coming.

970
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:25,058
Neither did I.

971
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:26,476
I told you he was alive.

972
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,520
Captain, you and your crew
have been grounded.

973
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,230
General,
if you'd just let me explain.

974
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:32,941
The protocols are put in place
for everyone's protection.

975
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:34,902
I'm sorry.
I saw an opportunity

976
01:08:34,985 --> 01:08:36,445
and I was afraid
we'd lose him.

977
01:08:36,528 --> 01:08:39,198
But, General, people have been
waiting for so long.

978
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:42,117
We found The One.

979
01:08:43,952 --> 01:08:45,662
I don't believe in The One.

980
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,041
I never did.

981
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:50,792
No?

982
01:08:51,877 --> 01:08:53,420
Me neither.

983
01:08:53,503 --> 01:08:55,881
But there was a time

984
01:08:55,964 --> 01:08:58,634
when you trusted me
with your ship,

985
01:08:58,717 --> 01:09:00,510
against the Council's orders.

986
01:09:00,594 --> 01:09:02,679
The world was different then.

987
01:09:04,514 --> 01:09:06,141
We were different.

988
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:09,603
Report to the docks.

989
01:09:09,686 --> 01:09:11,396
Scrub down the <i>Mnemosyne.</i>

990
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,774
Transfer your access codes.

991
01:09:13,857 --> 01:09:15,275
You are done, Captain.

992
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:26,787
We need to talk.

993
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,670
When word first came

994
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:37,005
that it actually
might be you...

995
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:44,554
I didn't know how I would feel
in this moment.

996
01:09:52,437 --> 01:09:54,398
It is nice to see you.

997
01:09:54,481 --> 01:09:57,192
It's good to see you too.

998
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:05,826
A long way
from Dozer's paint stripper.

999
01:10:05,909 --> 01:10:08,870
Yes.

1000
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:10,706
A lot has changed.

1001
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:14,167
Except maybe you.

1002
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:18,505
You remember this?

1003
01:10:25,595 --> 01:10:28,348
It's so easy to forget
how much noise

1004
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:30,350
the Matrix pumps
into your head

1005
01:10:30,434 --> 01:10:32,227
until you unplug.

1006
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:35,063
Yeah.

1007
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:38,066
Something else
makes the same kind of noise.

1008
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:40,360
Takes over every damn thing,

1009
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:42,154
just like the Matrix.

1010
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:44,823
War.

1011
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:49,161
I stood at the barricade
of the Temple.

1012
01:10:50,954 --> 01:10:53,248
Staring
at the army of Sentinels,

1013
01:10:54,374 --> 01:10:57,002
waiting for them
to kill every one of us.

1014
01:10:58,462 --> 01:11:01,548
But then, they left.

1015
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:05,218
They said you saved us.

1016
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:06,470
I didn't believe it.

1017
01:11:06,553 --> 01:11:09,890
Every night I would dream
of attack sirens.

1018
01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:11,808
But then,

1019
01:11:14,394 --> 01:11:16,605
I would wake up to this...

1020
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:22,069
silence.

1021
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:27,074
I'm ashamed of it now.

1022
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:31,161
My pessimism of how long
it took me to believe

1023
01:11:31,244 --> 01:11:34,498
a world without war
was possible.

1024
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:37,918
You gave me that.

1025
01:11:38,001 --> 01:11:40,879
You gave that gift to us all.

1026
01:11:40,962 --> 01:11:44,633
And it is the gift
that continues to bear fruit.

1027
01:11:47,344 --> 01:11:49,096
Come help me get up.

1028
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:50,931
Let's take a walk.

1029
01:12:15,038 --> 01:12:17,040
Oh! Beautiful.

1030
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:21,086
This is Freya, head of botany.

1031
01:12:21,169 --> 01:12:24,464
And this is Quillion,
our lead digitologist.

1032
01:12:24,548 --> 01:12:28,552
I presume our guest
needs no introduction.

1033
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:31,304
Nothing travels
faster than light,

1034
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:32,639
except gossip.

1035
01:12:35,016 --> 01:12:36,435
Welcome to the Garden, Neo.

1036
01:12:38,478 --> 01:12:39,646
A strawberry?

1037
01:12:39,729 --> 01:12:41,440
Using digital code
from the Matrix,

1038
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,942
we retro-convert it
into DNA sequences.

1039
01:12:44,025 --> 01:12:45,444
And they grow here?

1040
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:47,154
It's not easy
augmenting the genome

1041
01:12:47,237 --> 01:12:49,781
to photosynthesize
Bio-sky, but...

1042
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,616
We're getting there.

1043
01:12:52,367 --> 01:12:54,077
Go ahead. Try it.

1044
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:03,795
We're quite excited
about the blueberries.

1045
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:05,797
You remember that shit
we used to eat?

1046
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:08,258
That slop
that tasted like rust.

1047
01:13:09,843 --> 01:13:13,472
Zion could have never
made something like this.

1048
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:15,182
Why?

1049
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:17,851
Because we needed synthients

1050
01:13:17,934 --> 01:13:19,895
and DI like him.

1051
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:23,356
Zion was stuck in the past.
Stuck in war.

1052
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,817
Stuck in a Matrix of its own.

1053
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:29,779
They believed
that it had to be us or them.

1054
01:13:29,863 --> 01:13:32,866
This city was built by us

1055
01:13:32,949 --> 01:13:34,618
and them.

1056
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:41,833
What happened to Zion?

1057
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:45,337
I've been waiting
for you to ask that question.

1058
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:50,759
All of the troubles
started in the Machine Cities.

1059
01:13:50,842 --> 01:13:54,554
Power plants were unable
to produce enough energy.

1060
01:13:54,638 --> 01:13:58,391
Nothing can breed violence
like scarcity.

1061
01:14:00,143 --> 01:14:01,728
For the first time,

1062
01:14:01,811 --> 01:14:05,023
<i>we saw machines at war
with one other.</i>

1063
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:12,030
We got word from the Oracle
of a new power rising.

1064
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:16,660
That was the last
we heard from her.

1065
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:21,706
Morpheus.

1066
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:26,169
After the siege,
he was elected unanimously.

1067
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:29,130
High Chair of the Council.

1068
01:14:29,214 --> 01:14:32,634
Oh, how he loved that.

1069
01:14:32,717 --> 01:14:36,930
But as rumors
of this new power spread,

1070
01:14:37,013 --> 01:14:38,431
he ignored them.

1071
01:14:38,515 --> 01:14:43,144
He was certain what you had
done could not be undone.

1072
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:47,190
All of these people never
stopped believing in miracles,

1073
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:49,651
believing in you.

1074
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:03,081
I'm sorry.

1075
01:15:04,916 --> 01:15:07,335
How could I know
this would happen?

1076
01:15:07,419 --> 01:15:09,713
We didn't understand
all of it back then.

1077
01:15:09,796 --> 01:15:11,631
No more than we do now.

1078
01:15:11,715 --> 01:15:15,010
I didn't come here
to cause you problems, Niobe,

1079
01:15:16,052 --> 01:15:17,804
but I need your help.

1080
01:15:19,472 --> 01:15:20,932
Trinity is alive.

1081
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:22,767
Then there is
another question.

1082
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:24,644
Why did they keep her alive?

1083
01:15:24,728 --> 01:15:25,979
I can't answer that.

1084
01:15:26,062 --> 01:15:29,399
But if there's a chance
I can free her,

1085
01:15:29,482 --> 01:15:31,026
I have to try.

1086
01:15:31,109 --> 01:15:35,030
Even if it means endangering
everyone in this city?

1087
01:15:39,284 --> 01:15:40,994
I'm sorry, Neo.

1088
01:15:41,077 --> 01:15:44,748
I won't let what happened
to Zion happen to Io.

1089
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:47,917
I hope you'll forgive
an old woman

1090
01:15:48,001 --> 01:15:51,087
for asking you to go
with Sheperd, here,

1091
01:15:51,171 --> 01:15:52,672
till we have
better understanding

1092
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:54,174
of what's going on.

1093
01:15:54,257 --> 01:15:57,302
You're going to imprison me
after I just got free?

1094
01:15:57,385 --> 01:16:01,181
I know it doesn't seem fair,

1095
01:16:01,264 --> 01:16:04,059
but neither does growing old.

1096
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:06,269
But you don't
hear me complaining.

1097
01:16:18,281 --> 01:16:20,116
Sorry.

1098
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,243
I've never met
a legend before.

1099
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:26,706
Neo.

1100
01:16:27,999 --> 01:16:29,751
Sheperd.

1101
01:16:31,127 --> 01:16:32,962
Crazy. You're real.

1102
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,049
"Real."

1103
01:16:37,133 --> 01:16:39,135
There's that word again.

1104
01:16:44,641 --> 01:16:47,018
People talk a lot
about the old days.

1105
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:49,354
About you, the viral Agent.

1106
01:16:49,437 --> 01:16:52,065
The siege of Zion.

1107
01:16:52,148 --> 01:16:54,150
Everything was simpler
back then.

1108
01:16:55,151 --> 01:16:56,736
People wanted to be free.

1109
01:16:58,822 --> 01:17:00,740
It's different now.

1110
01:17:00,824 --> 01:17:04,285
Sometimes it feels like
people gave up.

1111
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:07,247
Like the Matrix won.

1112
01:17:10,041 --> 01:17:11,459
This is you.

1113
01:17:15,463 --> 01:17:17,757
And I gotta ask you one thing.

1114
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:21,511
Is it true you could fly?

1115
01:17:26,349 --> 01:17:27,350
Cool.

1116
01:17:57,881 --> 01:17:59,174
Morpheus.

1117
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:02,177
Oh. General stuck you
in the Rapunzel tower.

1118
01:18:04,637 --> 01:18:06,139
On the upside,
it's a nice view.

1119
01:18:06,222 --> 01:18:08,308
What happened to Bugs
and the others?

1120
01:18:08,391 --> 01:18:10,101
They're supposed to be
sterilizing the <i>Mnemosyne</i>

1121
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:12,312
- with a toothbrush.
- "Supposed to be"?

1122
01:18:12,395 --> 01:18:13,730
Well, I could tell you
that they're standing by,

1123
01:18:13,813 --> 01:18:15,064
waiting for you
to make the choice

1124
01:18:15,148 --> 01:18:16,983
to remain meekly incarcerated

1125
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:19,402
or bust the hell out of here
and go and find Trinity.

1126
01:18:20,987 --> 01:18:22,072
But that ain't a choice.

1127
01:18:34,709 --> 01:18:36,836
General,
what should we do?

1128
01:18:40,256 --> 01:18:42,842
Bugs has the same
independence of mind

1129
01:18:42,926 --> 01:18:44,385
she had the day you freed her.

1130
01:18:44,469 --> 01:18:47,472
This is not
independence of mind.

1131
01:18:47,555 --> 01:18:48,598
It's mutiny.

1132
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:51,184
Come on, 'Be.

1133
01:18:51,267 --> 01:18:54,270
I know how much
you hated locking him up.

1134
01:18:54,354 --> 01:18:57,065
Just like I know
there's a part of you

1135
01:18:57,148 --> 01:19:00,193
that's relieved now
that he's gone.

1136
01:19:01,653 --> 01:19:05,490
We've worked so hard
to keep Io safe.

1137
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:09,869
This scares me.

1138
01:19:20,421 --> 01:19:21,714
That's her.

1139
01:19:21,798 --> 01:19:22,924
On the bridge.

1140
01:19:23,466 --> 01:19:24,467
Got her.

1141
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:35,395
It's sick
how the Semblance works.

1142
01:19:35,478 --> 01:19:38,231
You see flashes
of the real her, but...

1143
01:19:38,314 --> 01:19:39,941
the way she reads...

1144
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:44,279
Code-wise,
she's pure bluepill.

1145
01:19:46,155 --> 01:19:49,242
This is a tough question, Neo,
but it has to be asked.

1146
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:52,537
What if she's happy
where she is?

1147
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:55,248
How did I read?

1148
01:19:57,333 --> 01:19:59,252
Exactly like her.

1149
01:20:03,006 --> 01:20:05,258
Take us to broadcast depth.

1150
01:20:16,561 --> 01:20:18,021
Thank you for helping me.

1151
01:20:19,647 --> 01:20:21,649
Most of us are here
because of you.

1152
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:25,445
I also admit our only chance

1153
01:20:25,528 --> 01:20:26,946
to get out
of the general's doghouse

1154
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:28,656
is for you to find your mojo.

1155
01:20:30,366 --> 01:20:32,952
What if I can't be
what I once was?

1156
01:20:34,495 --> 01:20:36,122
Then we're all fucked.

1157
01:20:36,205 --> 01:20:37,582
Two minutes.

1158
01:20:37,665 --> 01:20:39,042
Two minutes to broadcast.

1159
01:20:48,217 --> 01:20:49,552
I slipped you in
through a hotel room.

1160
01:20:51,387 --> 01:20:52,847
Should be safe.

1161
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,151
Portal's open.

1162
01:21:05,234 --> 01:21:07,362
Closest I could get you is
the warehouse near her garage.

1163
01:21:07,445 --> 01:21:08,988
Whole zone's
crawling with bots.

1164
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:11,908
Let's go.

1165
01:21:39,143 --> 01:21:42,271
So, what do you think of him?

1166
01:21:42,355 --> 01:21:45,149
I was kinda worried at first
because he's so much older.

1167
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:47,735
The beard, the hair... Oh.

1168
01:21:47,819 --> 01:21:51,239
- No, totally works for me.
- You idiot.

1169
01:21:51,322 --> 01:21:52,699
I mean "The One" thing.

1170
01:21:54,367 --> 01:21:57,328
You know, everyone that
shipped with him died.

1171
01:21:57,412 --> 01:22:00,206
Oh, yeah. He's gonna
get us all killed, for sure.

1172
01:22:05,586 --> 01:22:07,130
Predictable as ever.

1173
01:22:09,382 --> 01:22:11,134
Smith.

1174
01:22:11,217 --> 01:22:13,553
Smith? As in, "the" Smith?

1175
01:22:21,686 --> 01:22:22,979
This is so insane.

1176
01:22:23,062 --> 01:22:24,313
There's so many theories
about the two of them

1177
01:22:24,397 --> 01:22:26,065
and they're standing
right there.

1178
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:27,734
This code is freaky!

1179
01:22:27,817 --> 01:22:30,695
He's like an Agent, but not.

1180
01:22:34,866 --> 01:22:36,451
An appeal to reason.

1181
01:22:40,663 --> 01:22:42,165
How did you find us?

1182
01:22:42,248 --> 01:22:45,168
You never appreciated
our relationship.

1183
01:22:45,251 --> 01:22:46,627
Not like The Analyst.

1184
01:22:46,711 --> 01:22:48,629
- The what?
- My doctor.

1185
01:22:48,713 --> 01:22:52,425
He used our bond
and turned it into a chain.

1186
01:22:52,508 --> 01:22:54,177
It's so obvious
once you see it, right?

1187
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:57,680
But this whole altered-code
update really blew my mind.

1188
01:22:57,764 --> 01:22:59,766
I still don't know
how he did it.

1189
01:22:59,849 --> 01:23:02,643
You, as a balding nerd.

1190
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:04,479
Hilarious.

1191
01:23:04,562 --> 01:23:06,939
And me...

1192
01:23:07,023 --> 01:23:09,692
even more perfect.

1193
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:11,778
Maybe a little too far
on the piercing blue eyes.

1194
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:13,780
What do you think?

1195
01:23:13,863 --> 01:23:15,823
What do you want, Smith?

1196
01:23:17,992 --> 01:23:20,286
I have such dreams, Tom.

1197
01:23:20,369 --> 01:23:22,080
Big dreams.

1198
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:24,916
Well, mostly just extremely
violent revenge fantasies,

1199
01:23:24,999 --> 01:23:26,417
but in order for me
to pursue mine,

1200
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:28,544
I need to dissuade you
from pursuing yours.

1201
01:23:28,628 --> 01:23:32,256
Hmm. Sounds like conflict.

1202
01:23:33,966 --> 01:23:35,510
Inevitable?

1203
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:38,054
Doesn't have to be.

1204
01:23:38,137 --> 01:23:40,306
All you have to do
is stay out of the Matrix,

1205
01:23:40,389 --> 01:23:41,891
and leave
the good doctor to me.

1206
01:23:41,974 --> 01:23:44,310
You can have him.
I'm here for Trinity.

1207
01:23:44,393 --> 01:23:45,895
That's the trouble, Tom.

1208
01:23:45,978 --> 01:23:48,648
He knew you'd come,
just like I did.

1209
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:51,609
Trust me.

1210
01:23:52,568 --> 01:23:54,112
You're not ready for him.

1211
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:56,989
Captain, I'm reading portals
from the lower frequencies.

1212
01:24:02,286 --> 01:24:05,456
I won't have his leash
on my neck again.

1213
01:24:12,922 --> 01:24:15,174
I found some
old acquaintances of yours.

1214
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:19,595
Bugs!

1215
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:34,318
Exiles.

1216
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:35,570
I thought
they were all purged.

1217
01:24:35,653 --> 01:24:37,155
You?

1218
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:38,364
Oh!

1219
01:24:38,447 --> 01:24:40,783
It is you!

1220
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:45,705
All these years.
I can't believe it.

1221
01:24:46,372 --> 01:24:48,040
Oh, God.

1222
01:24:48,124 --> 01:24:52,086
You stole my life!

1223
01:24:56,841 --> 01:24:58,384
What the Merv
is trying to say,

1224
01:24:58,467 --> 01:25:00,928
is that their situation
is a little bit like mine.

1225
01:25:01,012 --> 01:25:03,222
To have their lives back,
yours has to end.

1226
01:25:06,893 --> 01:25:07,977
Kill him!

1227
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,659
You ruined

1228
01:25:23,743 --> 01:25:26,871
every suck-my-silky-ass thing!

1229
01:25:26,954 --> 01:25:29,540
We had grace.

1230
01:25:34,587 --> 01:25:36,130
We had style!

1231
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:38,216
We had conversation!

1232
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:40,259
Not this...

1233
01:26:04,784 --> 01:26:08,329
Art, films,
books were all better!

1234
01:26:08,412 --> 01:26:11,624
Originality mattered!

1235
01:26:11,707 --> 01:26:13,626
You gave us
Face-Zucker-suck

1236
01:26:13,709 --> 01:26:17,171
and Cock-me-climatey-
Wiki-piss-and-shit!

1237
01:27:03,301 --> 01:27:04,885
I still know kung fu.

1238
01:27:06,762 --> 01:27:07,763
Neo!

1239
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:38,961
Just like old times.

1240
01:28:36,602 --> 01:28:37,645
Neo.

1241
01:28:39,563 --> 01:28:42,233
I've been thinking
about us, Tom.

1242
01:28:42,316 --> 01:28:45,611
Look how binary is the form,
the nature of things.

1243
01:28:46,862 --> 01:28:48,155
Ones and zeros.

1244
01:28:49,365 --> 01:28:50,491
Light and dark.

1245
01:28:52,618 --> 01:28:54,662
Choice and its absence.

1246
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:00,292
Anderson and Smith.

1247
01:29:36,912 --> 01:29:39,123
You've lost something, Tom.

1248
01:29:43,085 --> 01:29:44,920
You're not
what you used to be.

1249
01:29:46,172 --> 01:29:47,256
It's true.

1250
01:30:00,603 --> 01:30:02,605
- Nice one.
- Thanks.

1251
01:30:10,446 --> 01:30:11,655
Come on, Neo.

1252
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:39,183
Captain. You okay?

1253
01:30:39,266 --> 01:30:42,228
Yeah. Where's Neo?

1254
01:30:42,311 --> 01:30:43,437
Smith is killing him.

1255
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:44,897
Where?

1256
01:30:52,404 --> 01:30:54,406
I feel bad about this, Tom.

1257
01:30:56,992 --> 01:30:59,119
After all, you are the one
who set me free...

1258
01:31:00,412 --> 01:31:01,413
again.

1259
01:31:03,457 --> 01:31:04,542
So, you, more than anyone,

1260
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:06,252
understands why
I can't go back.

1261
01:31:08,837 --> 01:31:10,631
You should have
listened to me.

1262
01:31:12,841 --> 01:31:14,593
Now you'll never
see her again.

1263
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:29,358
What was that?

1264
01:31:29,441 --> 01:31:30,818
That was Neo.

1265
01:31:32,444 --> 01:31:33,445
Mojo rising.

1266
01:31:41,495 --> 01:31:42,955
You all right?

1267
01:31:43,038 --> 01:31:44,540
Yeah.

1268
01:31:44,623 --> 01:31:45,791
It's gonna trigger a response.

1269
01:31:45,875 --> 01:31:47,084
I got multiple exits ready.

1270
01:31:47,167 --> 01:31:48,627
This is not over yet!

1271
01:31:48,711 --> 01:31:51,422
Our sequel franchise spinoff!

1272
01:31:58,470 --> 01:31:59,888
We should go.

1273
01:31:59,972 --> 01:32:01,140
I can't.

1274
01:32:01,223 --> 01:32:03,142
I have to talk to her.

1275
01:32:03,225 --> 01:32:05,477
Neo, those Exiles
were older than you,

1276
01:32:05,561 --> 01:32:06,645
and we barely handled them.

1277
01:32:10,232 --> 01:32:11,775
You really wanna do this now?

1278
01:32:17,197 --> 01:32:18,407
I mean...

1279
01:32:22,411 --> 01:32:23,996
you look like shit.

1280
01:32:35,257 --> 01:32:37,801
Oh, my God. What?
What happened?

1281
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:39,011
An accident.

1282
01:32:39,094 --> 01:32:41,430
Kush! Call a doctor.

1283
01:32:41,513 --> 01:32:43,057
It's fine.

1284
01:32:43,974 --> 01:32:46,101
I don't have a lot of time.

1285
01:32:46,185 --> 01:32:47,895
I wasn't sure
I'd see you again.

1286
01:32:47,978 --> 01:32:50,564
After we spoke, I realized...

1287
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:53,484
my life wasn't a life.

1288
01:32:54,943 --> 01:32:57,696
At some point,
I think I gave up

1289
01:32:57,780 --> 01:33:00,032
searching for something real.

1290
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:07,665
Wait.

1291
01:33:09,124 --> 01:33:11,710
Something happened.

1292
01:33:11,794 --> 01:33:14,171
I looked for you
at the coffee shop.

1293
01:33:15,964 --> 01:33:18,300
I began to wonder
if I imagined you.

1294
01:33:19,468 --> 01:33:22,012
And then last night
I had a dream.

1295
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:24,890
In the dream, you were
surrounded by police,

1296
01:33:24,973 --> 01:33:27,518
then they started chasing us.

1297
01:33:27,601 --> 01:33:30,604
- Us?
- You were on my bike with me.

1298
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:34,149
How did it end?

1299
01:33:35,567 --> 01:33:36,735
Not good.

1300
01:33:39,279 --> 01:33:42,700
I've had dreams
that weren't just dreams.

1301
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:45,035
You mean a dream
that came true?

1302
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:55,337
Finally, we can talk
like adults.

1303
01:33:57,005 --> 01:34:00,134
I hate lying. I do.
It exhausts me.

1304
01:34:01,927 --> 01:34:04,012
Tiff and I have been
waiting for you...

1305
01:34:04,096 --> 01:34:05,347
like, forever.

1306
01:34:12,438 --> 01:34:13,731
Deja vu, right?

1307
01:34:15,524 --> 01:34:17,693
Oh, no use.
You can't beat time.

1308
01:34:17,776 --> 01:34:21,488
This rewind is happening
faster than you can blink.

1309
01:34:26,368 --> 01:34:28,370
You gave me the idea.

1310
01:34:31,206 --> 01:34:34,501
Allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word.

1311
01:34:37,546 --> 01:34:38,672
"Bullet time."

1312
01:34:40,507 --> 01:34:42,468
I know. Kind of ironic,

1313
01:34:42,551 --> 01:34:46,472
using the power that defined
you to control you.

1314
01:34:46,555 --> 01:34:49,183
I kept such a close eye on you

1315
01:34:49,266 --> 01:34:51,810
and still you found a way out.

1316
01:34:51,894 --> 01:34:54,271
Clever monkey,
using that Modal.

1317
01:34:55,230 --> 01:34:56,398
Call me an optimist,

1318
01:34:56,482 --> 01:34:58,650
but this could
all be for the best.

1319
01:34:58,734 --> 01:35:01,570
The skin's not looking
too bad this time.

1320
01:35:01,653 --> 01:35:04,281
I know some of this will be
difficult for you to hear,

1321
01:35:04,364 --> 01:35:05,824
after everything
you went through.

1322
01:35:05,908 --> 01:35:07,284
All that pain and suffering,

1323
01:35:07,367 --> 01:35:10,204
only to learn the world
doesn't end when you do.

1324
01:35:11,747 --> 01:35:12,831
Surprise.

1325
01:35:18,837 --> 01:35:20,255
I was there when you died.

1326
01:35:22,758 --> 01:35:23,884
I said to myself,

1327
01:35:23,967 --> 01:35:27,179
"Here is the anomaly
of anomalies."

1328
01:35:27,262 --> 01:35:30,057
What an extraordinary
opportunity.

1329
01:35:31,725 --> 01:35:33,185
First, I had to convince
the Suits

1330
01:35:33,268 --> 01:35:34,686
to let me rebuild
the two of you.

1331
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:36,355
Why her? Getting there.

1332
01:35:36,438 --> 01:35:38,232
And don't worry,
she can't hear me.

1333
01:35:38,315 --> 01:35:41,443
Resurrecting you both
was crazy expensive.

1334
01:35:41,527 --> 01:35:42,861
Like renovating a house.

1335
01:35:42,945 --> 01:35:45,197
Took twice as long,
cost twice as much.

1336
01:35:49,284 --> 01:35:51,745
I thought you'd be happy
to be alive again.

1337
01:35:52,788 --> 01:35:54,039
So wrong.

1338
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:59,461
Did you know hope and despair
are nearly identical in code?

1339
01:36:01,463 --> 01:36:03,423
We worked for years,

1340
01:36:03,507 --> 01:36:05,134
<i>trying to activate
your source code.</i>

1341
01:36:05,217 --> 01:36:08,637
I was about to give up,
when I realized...

1342
01:36:11,723 --> 01:36:12,766
Trinity.

1343
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:15,018
...it was never just you.

1344
01:36:15,102 --> 01:36:18,188
Alone, neither of you
is of any particular value.

1345
01:36:19,898 --> 01:36:21,066
Like acids and bases,

1346
01:36:21,149 --> 01:36:23,527
you're dangerous
when mixed together.

1347
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:26,572
Every sim
where you two bonded...

1348
01:36:26,655 --> 01:36:28,740
Let's just say
bad things happened.

1349
01:36:30,784 --> 01:36:32,244
Neo!

1350
01:36:36,498 --> 01:36:39,877
However, as long as I managed
to keep you close,

1351
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,628
but not too close,

1352
01:36:41,712 --> 01:36:44,923
I discovered
something incredible.

1353
01:36:45,007 --> 01:36:48,510
Now, my predecessor
loved precision.

1354
01:36:48,594 --> 01:36:52,264
His Matrix was all fussy facts
and equations.

1355
01:36:52,347 --> 01:36:54,099
He hated the human mind.

1356
01:36:54,182 --> 01:36:55,601
So he never bothered
to realize

1357
01:36:55,684 --> 01:36:56,852
that you don't give a shit
about facts.

1358
01:36:56,935 --> 01:36:58,353
It's all about fiction.

1359
01:36:58,437 --> 01:37:03,108
The only world that matters
is the one in here.

1360
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:06,194
And you people
believe the craziest shit.

1361
01:37:06,737 --> 01:37:07,988
Why?

1362
01:37:08,071 --> 01:37:10,657
What validates
and makes your fictions real?

1363
01:37:11,617 --> 01:37:12,701
Feelings.

1364
01:37:13,869 --> 01:37:15,329
Allow me.

1365
01:37:16,705 --> 01:37:18,373
Kush, here,
is one of my handlers.

1366
01:37:18,457 --> 01:37:19,791
They're everywhere.

1367
01:37:19,875 --> 01:37:22,461
Such a pain, cloning Agents
over a coppertop.

1368
01:37:22,544 --> 01:37:25,005
Far more effective
just to saturate a population.

1369
01:37:26,924 --> 01:37:29,801
And, bonus,
swarm mode is sick fun.

1370
01:37:42,230 --> 01:37:45,359
Ooh! Nicely done.

1371
01:37:46,818 --> 01:37:50,072
You ever wonder
why you have nightmares?

1372
01:37:50,155 --> 01:37:53,116
Why your own brain
tortures you?

1373
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:56,703
It's actually us,
maximizing your output.

1374
01:37:56,787 --> 01:37:57,955
It works just like this.

1375
01:37:58,038 --> 01:38:00,666
Oh, no!
Can you stop the bullet?

1376
01:38:00,749 --> 01:38:03,669
If only you could move faster.

1377
01:38:03,752 --> 01:38:06,296
Here's the thing
about feelings.

1378
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:08,674
They're so much easier
to control than facts.

1379
01:38:09,633 --> 01:38:11,510
Turns out, in my Matrix,

1380
01:38:11,593 --> 01:38:15,055
the worse we treat you,
the more we manipulate you,

1381
01:38:15,138 --> 01:38:17,599
the more energy you produce.

1382
01:38:17,683 --> 01:38:19,893
It's nuts.

1383
01:38:19,977 --> 01:38:21,561
I've been setting
productivity records

1384
01:38:21,645 --> 01:38:22,938
every year since I took over.

1385
01:38:23,021 --> 01:38:25,857
And, the best part,
zero resistance.

1386
01:38:25,941 --> 01:38:27,317
People stay in their pods,

1387
01:38:27,401 --> 01:38:30,487
happier than pigs in shit.

1388
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:31,780
The key to it all?

1389
01:38:31,863 --> 01:38:33,198
You.

1390
01:38:33,281 --> 01:38:34,449
And her.

1391
01:38:34,533 --> 01:38:36,743
Quietly yearning
for what you don't have,

1392
01:38:36,827 --> 01:38:39,246
while dreading
losing what you do.

1393
01:38:39,329 --> 01:38:40,998
For 99.9% of your race,

1394
01:38:41,081 --> 01:38:43,750
that is the definition
of reality.

1395
01:38:43,834 --> 01:38:46,712
Desire and fear, baby.

1396
01:38:46,795 --> 01:38:49,756
Just give the people
what they want, right?

1397
01:38:59,057 --> 01:39:02,102
She's the only home
you have, Thomas.

1398
01:39:02,185 --> 01:39:05,480
Come home before
something terrible happens.

1399
01:39:15,907 --> 01:39:17,200
- Bugs!
- I hear him.

1400
01:39:23,582 --> 01:39:24,750
Trinity!

1401
01:39:24,833 --> 01:39:26,543
- You shouldn't call me that.
- I'm sorry.

1402
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:29,296
I have to go.

1403
01:39:29,379 --> 01:39:30,547
But I'll be back.

1404
01:39:31,673 --> 01:39:33,967
Neo! Time to go.

1405
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:38,180
- Sentinels?
- Worse.

1406
01:39:39,639 --> 01:39:40,724
<i>General ordered me</i>

1407
01:39:40,807 --> 01:39:41,808
<i>to look after the ship.</i>

1408
01:39:41,892 --> 01:39:43,769
So you shadowed us?

1409
01:39:43,852 --> 01:39:45,437
Check your long-range scans.

1410
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,522
<i>Squids are combing this area.</i>

1411
01:39:47,606 --> 01:39:49,066
He's right.

1412
01:39:49,149 --> 01:39:50,317
You can stay here and die,

1413
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,778
or come back
and face a court-martial.

1414
01:39:52,861 --> 01:39:54,863
And you call that a choice?

1415
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:04,206
Sheperd should have
left you to the Squids.

1416
01:40:04,289 --> 01:40:07,667
I'm too damn old to sit
through some boring-ass trial.

1417
01:40:07,751 --> 01:40:08,960
Niobe, don't blame Bugs.

1418
01:40:09,044 --> 01:40:10,962
Do shut your mouth.

1419
01:40:11,046 --> 01:40:13,340
Do address me as General.

1420
01:40:13,423 --> 01:40:17,677
And do not rob
my ex-captain of her agency,

1421
01:40:17,761 --> 01:40:19,763
which she exercised
with her own

1422
01:40:19,846 --> 01:40:23,350
particular brand
of shortsighted stupidity.

1423
01:40:24,601 --> 01:40:25,685
Shortsighted?

1424
01:40:27,354 --> 01:40:31,316
You care more about growing
fruit than freeing minds.

1425
01:40:31,399 --> 01:40:33,902
We are not going
to have this argument again.

1426
01:40:33,985 --> 01:40:36,321
It's not an argument.
It's a fact.

1427
01:40:36,404 --> 01:40:37,614
You gave up on people.

1428
01:40:39,074 --> 01:40:41,409
I tell you
what I'm going to give up on

1429
01:40:41,493 --> 01:40:42,577
and it's you!

1430
01:40:44,996 --> 01:40:46,915
Sheperd, get her
out of my sight!

1431
01:40:46,998 --> 01:40:48,125
General...

1432
01:40:50,043 --> 01:40:51,128
Disarm!

1433
01:40:51,211 --> 01:40:52,838
Kujaku's a friend.

1434
01:40:59,386 --> 01:41:01,012
Hello, friend.

1435
01:41:03,598 --> 01:41:04,599
Okay.

1436
01:41:05,934 --> 01:41:07,144
Him?

1437
01:41:14,067 --> 01:41:15,735
General.

1438
01:41:15,819 --> 01:41:17,112
Thank you for seeing me.

1439
01:41:17,195 --> 01:41:18,989
I figured if there was anyone

1440
01:41:19,072 --> 01:41:21,366
who could make sense
of this mess,

1441
01:41:21,449 --> 01:41:23,243
it would be you.

1442
01:41:23,326 --> 01:41:24,452
Hello, Neo.

1443
01:41:24,536 --> 01:41:26,371
I know you.

1444
01:41:26,454 --> 01:41:28,456
I tried to keep my eye on you.

1445
01:41:31,793 --> 01:41:33,044
Why?

1446
01:41:33,128 --> 01:41:34,880
We met a long time ago.

1447
01:41:36,590 --> 01:41:37,674
Good morning.

1448
01:41:40,468 --> 01:41:41,469
Sati.

1449
01:41:41,553 --> 01:41:44,055
My father knew
we'd meet again,

1450
01:41:44,139 --> 01:41:47,100
though he would have wished
for happier circumstances.

1451
01:41:47,184 --> 01:41:48,977
His inadvertent role
in what happened to you

1452
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:51,313
was the greatest regret
of his life.

1453
01:41:51,396 --> 01:41:53,273
I don't understand.

1454
01:41:54,649 --> 01:41:56,318
My father
was the chief engineer

1455
01:41:56,401 --> 01:41:57,652
at the Anomaleum.

1456
01:41:57,736 --> 01:41:59,112
The what?

1457
01:41:59,196 --> 01:42:02,282
My father designed
the resurrection pods

1458
01:42:02,365 --> 01:42:04,284
where Neo and Trinity
were imprisoned.

1459
01:42:06,328 --> 01:42:07,579
I'm sorry.

1460
01:42:07,662 --> 01:42:09,164
You knew what happened to him?

1461
01:42:09,247 --> 01:42:12,459
You knew that he and Trinity
both were alive...

1462
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:14,753
and you didn't tell me?

1463
01:42:14,836 --> 01:42:17,756
There were times
I doubted my decision, Niobe.

1464
01:42:17,839 --> 01:42:19,466
But Io needed you.

1465
01:42:19,549 --> 01:42:20,884
This city needed to be built

1466
01:42:20,967 --> 01:42:23,011
for your people
as well as mine.

1467
01:42:24,179 --> 01:42:25,931
If I would have
told you everything,

1468
01:42:26,014 --> 01:42:28,183
you would have had a very
difficult choice to make.

1469
01:42:28,266 --> 01:42:29,851
My friends

1470
01:42:31,186 --> 01:42:33,688
let me make my own choices.

1471
01:42:33,772 --> 01:42:35,690
If it was a mistake,

1472
01:42:35,774 --> 01:42:37,859
you have my deepest apologies.

1473
01:42:39,945 --> 01:42:41,279
Why are you here now?

1474
01:42:41,363 --> 01:42:43,865
Neo's escape has
destabilized the Matrix.

1475
01:42:43,949 --> 01:42:45,200
The Anomaleum
draws its current

1476
01:42:45,283 --> 01:42:46,618
from Trinity alone now.

1477
01:42:46,701 --> 01:42:48,870
A fail-safe has been
triggered to reset

1478
01:42:48,954 --> 01:42:50,956
the Matrix back
to the previous version.

1479
01:42:51,039 --> 01:42:52,832
But The Analyst
halted the reset.

1480
01:42:52,916 --> 01:42:54,209
He's convinced the authorities

1481
01:42:54,292 --> 01:42:56,253
that you will soon
return voluntarily.

1482
01:42:57,379 --> 01:42:59,297
And why would he say that?

1483
01:42:59,381 --> 01:43:02,467
Because if I don't go back,
he'll kill Trinity.

1484
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:07,597
Faced with returning
to your pod

1485
01:43:07,681 --> 01:43:10,475
or enduring
Trinity's death again.

1486
01:43:10,558 --> 01:43:11,851
What would you choose, Neo?

1487
01:43:12,936 --> 01:43:14,229
I'll go back.

1488
01:43:15,939 --> 01:43:18,149
Well, The Analyst
knows you well,

1489
01:43:18,233 --> 01:43:20,986
but that knowledge
has made him incautious.

1490
01:43:21,069 --> 01:43:22,737
After you escaped,

1491
01:43:22,821 --> 01:43:25,657
he should have accepted his
losses and devacuated Trinity.

1492
01:43:25,740 --> 01:43:28,618
But that would have prevented
this extraordinary opportunity

1493
01:43:28,702 --> 01:43:30,620
that now exists before us.

1494
01:43:31,288 --> 01:43:34,207
A few hours ago,

1495
01:43:34,291 --> 01:43:37,585
no one would have been able
to convince me

1496
01:43:37,669 --> 01:43:41,965
that I would be standing here,
trying to explain a mission

1497
01:43:42,048 --> 01:43:44,009
as crazy as this one.

1498
01:43:47,804 --> 01:43:49,431
What are you doing?

1499
01:43:49,514 --> 01:43:51,057
- Volunteering.
- Oh, no.

1500
01:43:51,141 --> 01:43:55,687
You are the one captain
that I am ordering to go.

1501
01:43:55,770 --> 01:43:57,355
Now you don't
have to order me, General,

1502
01:43:57,439 --> 01:43:59,107
'cause I'm volunteering.

1503
01:44:02,485 --> 01:44:04,029
I need two more.

1504
01:44:08,533 --> 01:44:11,369
Are you out of your minds?

1505
01:44:11,453 --> 01:44:13,330
You don't even know
what it is.

1506
01:44:13,413 --> 01:44:16,333
General, we know you.

1507
01:44:16,416 --> 01:44:17,625
If you say this is important,

1508
01:44:17,709 --> 01:44:19,753
none of us is
choosing to stay home.

1509
01:44:25,133 --> 01:44:26,217
Thank you.

1510
01:44:31,306 --> 01:44:33,308
Knuckle up, and good luck.

1511
01:45:03,338 --> 01:45:04,839
Trinity is held
in the Anomaleum,

1512
01:45:04,923 --> 01:45:06,674
which is in this
transmission tower.

1513
01:45:06,758 --> 01:45:09,010
<i>The passages used
to rescue Neo are now sealed</i>

1514
01:45:09,094 --> 01:45:11,304
<i>and a legion of Sentinels
patrols the tower.</i>

1515
01:45:11,388 --> 01:45:13,431
So, stealth will be paramount.

1516
01:45:13,515 --> 01:45:15,266
As long as we raise no alarms,

1517
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:17,435
this first part of the mission
should be the easiest.

1518
01:45:17,519 --> 01:45:18,770
You mean
crossing the Fetus Fields,

1519
01:45:18,853 --> 01:45:20,605
sneaking across
an entire power plant,

1520
01:45:20,688 --> 01:45:22,107
climbing
a two-kilometer tower

1521
01:45:22,190 --> 01:45:24,025
guarded by thousands
of Sentinels?

1522
01:45:24,109 --> 01:45:25,276
That's the easy part?

1523
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:27,028
Exactly so.

1524
01:45:27,112 --> 01:45:29,447
Because all we have to do
is convince someone

1525
01:45:29,531 --> 01:45:31,199
who does this every day

1526
01:45:31,282 --> 01:45:32,700
to take one of us along.

1527
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:58,059
Fifty meters
below the Anomaleum

1528
01:45:58,143 --> 01:45:59,644
is a stratum
of amniotic filters.

1529
01:45:59,727 --> 01:46:03,148
Hidden along this edge
is a small hexagonal vent.

1530
01:46:03,231 --> 01:46:06,401
<i>This vent feeds the air intake
into the corpuscular modifier,</i>

1531
01:46:06,484 --> 01:46:09,571
<i>which oxygenates
the bio-gel used in Neo's pod.</i>

1532
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:11,448
I get it.

1533
01:46:11,531 --> 01:46:14,409
The exomorph slinkies up
Neo's old umbilicus.

1534
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:16,786
What could go wrong?

1535
01:47:03,666 --> 01:47:05,043
<i>Once inside,</i>

1536
01:47:05,126 --> 01:47:06,961
<i>Morpheus will use
the System Operator</i>

1537
01:47:07,045 --> 01:47:09,380
<i>to open the devacuator line
and disengage the macerators.</i>

1538
01:47:13,468 --> 01:47:15,053
In order to unplug
Trinity's body,

1539
01:47:15,136 --> 01:47:17,347
while her mind still remains
connected to the Matrix,

1540
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:19,057
I'm gonna need
a second human brain

1541
01:47:19,140 --> 01:47:20,350
to implement the bypass.

1542
01:47:20,433 --> 01:47:22,060
And since Neo
must be with The Analyst,

1543
01:47:22,143 --> 01:47:25,313
the only available mind
that's a near-enough match

1544
01:47:25,396 --> 01:47:26,439
is yours.

1545
01:47:27,982 --> 01:47:28,900
Figures.

1546
01:47:46,417 --> 01:47:47,544
Thanks, Cybebe.

1547
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:57,762
Does Trinity still have
to take the red pill?

1548
01:47:57,845 --> 01:47:59,264
Since Kujaku and I
are transferring

1549
01:47:59,347 --> 01:48:00,640
her consciousness
onto the ship,

1550
01:48:00,723 --> 01:48:02,392
it's not strictly necessary.

1551
01:48:02,475 --> 01:48:06,396
But what matters is that
this is her choice.

1552
01:48:06,479 --> 01:48:09,774
Extracting a confused
or an uncertain mind will,

1553
01:48:09,857 --> 01:48:11,234
in all probability, kill her.

1554
01:48:11,317 --> 01:48:13,861
But even if it is
what she wants,

1555
01:48:13,945 --> 01:48:17,615
won't The Analyst just order
the Sentinels to stop you?

1556
01:48:17,699 --> 01:48:19,200
He will.

1557
01:48:19,284 --> 01:48:21,744
But if my plan works,
it won't matter.

1558
01:48:21,828 --> 01:48:22,787
Why?

1559
01:48:22,870 --> 01:48:24,497
Because we'll already be gone.

1560
01:48:26,207 --> 01:48:28,126
Somebody thinks
this hard about a plan,

1561
01:48:28,209 --> 01:48:29,627
there has to be a reason why.

1562
01:48:31,838 --> 01:48:33,047
When my father realized

1563
01:48:33,131 --> 01:48:35,383
how the Anomaleum
was going to be used,

1564
01:48:35,466 --> 01:48:38,928
he covertly transferred
the designs to me.

1565
01:48:39,012 --> 01:48:41,514
The Analyst
discovered his betrayal

1566
01:48:41,598 --> 01:48:43,474
and had my parents purged.

1567
01:48:46,102 --> 01:48:49,105
I would have been murdered too
if it wasn't for Kujaku.

1568
01:48:52,150 --> 01:48:56,154
Not a day goes by
that I don't grieve them.

1569
01:48:56,237 --> 01:48:59,365
I've been praying for this day
for a very long time.

1570
01:49:07,457 --> 01:49:09,000
We're coming up on broadcast.

1571
01:49:11,586 --> 01:49:15,590
I thought you should know
that I'm here because of her.

1572
01:49:19,093 --> 01:49:21,471
All I ever wanted was to be
as fearless as Trinity.

1573
01:49:23,681 --> 01:49:27,101
But I saw how she reacted
in the garage, and I...

1574
01:49:27,185 --> 01:49:29,812
You're wondering if I'm wrong.

1575
01:49:29,896 --> 01:49:31,439
What if we're too late?

1576
01:49:33,232 --> 01:49:34,942
What if she's not
Trinity anymore?

1577
01:49:40,365 --> 01:49:43,117
I never believed
I was The One.

1578
01:49:43,993 --> 01:49:45,411
But she did.

1579
01:49:46,454 --> 01:49:48,081
She believed in me.

1580
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:52,960
It's my turn
to believe in her.

1581
01:50:17,944 --> 01:50:19,862
This is
where it gets tricky.

1582
01:50:30,998 --> 01:50:33,418
Have you ever done
an operation like this?

1583
01:50:34,127 --> 01:50:35,211
Not yet.

1584
01:50:56,941 --> 01:50:58,276
Here we go.

1585
01:51:15,918 --> 01:51:17,837
Welcome home.

1586
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:20,298
All I want is to talk to her.

1587
01:51:20,381 --> 01:51:22,008
Do you mean Tiff?

1588
01:51:22,091 --> 01:51:24,844
Come back, and you can talk
to her as often as you like.

1589
01:51:24,927 --> 01:51:26,304
I mean, handsome Chad

1590
01:51:26,387 --> 01:51:27,847
may have something
to say about it.

1591
01:51:27,930 --> 01:51:31,225
If she tells me
this is what she wants,

1592
01:51:32,435 --> 01:51:33,603
you win.

1593
01:51:33,686 --> 01:51:34,812
Really?

1594
01:51:34,896 --> 01:51:37,648
But if she wants me,

1595
01:51:37,732 --> 01:51:39,567
then you'll let us go free.

1596
01:51:39,650 --> 01:51:42,403
And why would I do something
as stupid as that?

1597
01:51:42,487 --> 01:51:45,281
Right now, I'm on a ship full
of people who will unplug me

1598
01:51:45,364 --> 01:51:48,367
before they'll let you
take me back.

1599
01:51:48,451 --> 01:51:50,495
If you want this Matrix,

1600
01:51:50,578 --> 01:51:52,121
this is your only chance.

1601
01:51:52,205 --> 01:51:55,166
But how do I know
they won't unplug you anyway?

1602
01:51:55,249 --> 01:51:58,586
Same way I know you'll let us
walk out of here.

1603
01:52:24,195 --> 01:52:25,863
Okay.

1604
01:52:25,947 --> 01:52:27,448
I like tests.

1605
01:52:28,324 --> 01:52:30,117
We'll let Tiff decide.

1606
01:52:47,468 --> 01:52:48,636
That's it.

1607
01:52:49,846 --> 01:52:51,389
Bypass is ready.

1608
01:52:51,472 --> 01:52:53,182
Now what?

1609
01:52:53,266 --> 01:52:54,517
We wait.

1610
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:56,561
Doesn't it seem crazy
to come all this way

1611
01:52:56,644 --> 01:52:58,229
and leave her here?

1612
01:52:58,312 --> 01:53:00,982
We must abide by her decision.

1613
01:53:01,065 --> 01:53:02,650
And if she says no,

1614
01:53:03,484 --> 01:53:04,944
what happens to Neo?

1615
01:53:05,027 --> 01:53:06,237
At this time,

1616
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:09,156
the most important choice
of Neo's life

1617
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:10,741
is not his to make.

1618
01:53:41,772 --> 01:53:43,566
I saw this in my dream.

1619
01:53:45,026 --> 01:53:48,487
If I was the Oracle,
maybe I could explain it.

1620
01:53:49,155 --> 01:53:50,740
The Oracle.

1621
01:53:50,823 --> 01:53:52,491
From your game?

1622
01:53:54,368 --> 01:53:56,621
It's not a game.

1623
01:53:58,748 --> 01:53:59,957
Oh, God.

1624
01:54:07,423 --> 01:54:10,843
After you left, I went home

1625
01:54:10,927 --> 01:54:12,637
and I played it.

1626
01:54:15,014 --> 01:54:17,475
I kept thinking,

1627
01:54:17,558 --> 01:54:20,895
why does this story
feel like a memory?

1628
01:54:28,069 --> 01:54:29,820
There's a part of me

1629
01:54:32,406 --> 01:54:35,618
that feels like I have been
waiting my whole life for you.

1630
01:54:38,579 --> 01:54:40,831
And that part is like,

1631
01:54:40,915 --> 01:54:44,627
"What the hell
took you so long?"

1632
01:54:44,710 --> 01:54:46,754
I don't have an easy answer.

1633
01:54:48,923 --> 01:54:51,092
Maybe I was afraid of this.

1634
01:54:52,551 --> 01:54:54,428
Afraid of what might happen.

1635
01:54:55,930 --> 01:54:58,933
Afraid of hurting
the only person I ever loved.

1636
01:55:00,643 --> 01:55:04,188
I wish I was
who you think I am.

1637
01:55:05,564 --> 01:55:07,149
But look at me.

1638
01:55:08,442 --> 01:55:10,611
I can't be her.

1639
01:55:10,695 --> 01:55:12,822
- Mom!
- Mom! Come on.

1640
01:55:12,905 --> 01:55:14,156
- Mom!
- It's Callie.

1641
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:15,241
Is this real?

1642
01:55:15,324 --> 01:55:16,492
You have to come with us.

1643
01:55:16,575 --> 01:55:17,952
Come on,
we gotta go.

1644
01:55:18,035 --> 01:55:19,537
Tiff, hey. Don't know
what's going on here,

1645
01:55:19,620 --> 01:55:20,955
but I'm glad we found you.

1646
01:55:21,038 --> 01:55:22,331
- She got hit by a car!
- I know, it's crazy.

1647
01:55:22,415 --> 01:55:23,541
She was chasing after you.

1648
01:55:23,624 --> 01:55:24,959
They're casting her arm.
We gotta go.

1649
01:55:25,042 --> 01:55:26,419
Doctor said
she's gonna be fine.

1650
01:55:26,502 --> 01:55:28,295
You have to come
with us to the hospital.

1651
01:55:28,379 --> 01:55:29,463
It's too late.

1652
01:55:29,547 --> 01:55:30,756
I understand.

1653
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:32,675
- Tiff, come on, let's go.
- Come on.

1654
01:55:39,181 --> 01:55:40,266
What's happening?

1655
01:55:42,351 --> 01:55:43,477
Neo was wrong.

1656
01:56:16,844 --> 01:56:17,928
Tiffany.

1657
01:56:21,515 --> 01:56:24,060
Tiffany, you have
to come with us.

1658
01:56:25,686 --> 01:56:27,063
Tiffany!

1659
01:56:29,356 --> 01:56:33,069
I wish you would
fucking stop calling me that.

1660
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:34,695
I hate that name.

1661
01:56:36,197 --> 01:56:37,740
My name is Trinity

1662
01:56:37,823 --> 01:56:40,201
and you better
take your hands off of me.

1663
01:56:51,378 --> 01:56:52,379
Neo!

1664
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:53,881
Trinity!

1665
01:56:55,049 --> 01:56:56,092
Oh, shit.

1666
01:56:57,384 --> 01:56:58,719
Get her out. Get her out!

1667
01:57:07,353 --> 01:57:10,648
Aye-yi-yi, what a mess.

1668
01:57:10,731 --> 01:57:13,400
I own that mistake.
Shouldn't have pressed.

1669
01:57:13,484 --> 01:57:16,487
Women used to be
so easy to control.

1670
01:57:16,570 --> 01:57:21,117
You know there's no way
I can let you two go free.

1671
01:57:24,537 --> 01:57:25,996
Cannot happen.

1672
01:57:29,166 --> 01:57:32,002
So, I guess it's deja vu
all over again.

1673
01:57:33,129 --> 01:57:34,922
She dies

1674
01:57:35,005 --> 01:57:36,382
and it's all your fault.

1675
01:57:37,925 --> 01:57:40,511
Lies, lies and more lies.

1676
01:57:41,262 --> 01:57:42,471
Smith?

1677
01:57:42,555 --> 01:57:43,681
What has the world come to

1678
01:57:43,764 --> 01:57:44,932
when you can't even
trust a program?

1679
01:57:45,015 --> 01:57:48,352
How...

1680
01:57:48,435 --> 01:57:51,188
Tom and I have more in common
than you know.

1681
01:57:51,272 --> 01:57:54,316
Once he got out,
let's just say,

1682
01:57:55,151 --> 01:57:56,944
I was free to be me.

1683
01:58:04,618 --> 01:58:07,371
- Yeah!
- Trinity?

1684
01:58:55,753 --> 01:58:56,921
You ready?

1685
01:58:57,004 --> 01:58:58,297
Yeah.

1686
01:59:40,381 --> 01:59:41,840
Oh, no.

1687
01:59:43,217 --> 01:59:45,594
Destroy her. Destroy her!

1688
02:00:02,569 --> 02:00:03,570
No.

1689
02:00:09,410 --> 02:00:10,911
Stop them.

1690
02:00:36,562 --> 02:00:38,063
You think this is over?

1691
02:00:38,147 --> 02:00:40,149
Lockdown. Initiate swarm.

1692
02:00:49,116 --> 02:00:51,452
Here, our unexpected
alliance ends.

1693
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:55,748
You know the difference
between us, Tom?

1694
02:00:55,831 --> 02:00:57,708
Anyone could have been you.

1695
02:00:57,791 --> 02:00:59,835
Whereas I've always
been anyone.

1696
02:01:05,215 --> 02:01:06,717
What just happened?

1697
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:07,968
What?

1698
02:01:09,970 --> 02:01:12,556
Oh, no! Move! Move!

1699
02:01:12,639 --> 02:01:13,682
Get the hell out of there!

1700
02:01:17,561 --> 02:01:19,521
- How bad?
- Like, all the bad.

1701
02:01:20,814 --> 02:01:22,274
Yeah, this is bad.

1702
02:01:23,650 --> 02:01:25,277
I don't suppose
you can still fly?

1703
02:01:35,662 --> 02:01:37,373
Yeah, that's not happening.

1704
02:02:03,107 --> 02:02:04,358
Neo! Get on.

1705
02:02:13,033 --> 02:02:14,827
Calliope! Take the wounded!

1706
02:02:14,910 --> 02:02:16,954
Everyone else,
we stay with them!

1707
02:02:34,012 --> 02:02:36,557
- How is she?
- Life signs are good.

1708
02:02:40,394 --> 02:02:41,854
Her signal's strong, Captain.

1709
02:02:50,737 --> 02:02:52,781
Well done, Captain.

1710
02:02:55,159 --> 02:02:57,035
All we need is a miracle.

1711
02:03:25,105 --> 02:03:26,148
I hate bots.

1712
02:03:32,446 --> 02:03:34,281
- Get us out of here!
- I'm trying!

1713
02:03:34,364 --> 02:03:36,366
The lockdown is tracking.
Swarm is everywhere.

1714
02:03:36,450 --> 02:03:37,618
Never seen anything like this.

1715
02:04:23,497 --> 02:04:25,666
Seq, what is that?

1716
02:04:30,671 --> 02:04:31,797
What's wrong?

1717
02:04:33,507 --> 02:04:35,008
What are you...

1718
02:04:42,558 --> 02:04:44,601
He's turning bots into bombs.

1719
02:05:17,050 --> 02:05:18,260
Shit!

1720
02:05:18,343 --> 02:05:19,344
Lexy?

1721
02:05:33,734 --> 02:05:34,943
Sheperd's in trouble.

1722
02:05:38,030 --> 02:05:39,823
Jack me in.

1723
02:05:39,906 --> 02:05:41,950
I can get you in.
I don't know if I can get you out.

1724
02:05:47,914 --> 02:05:49,625
No!

1725
02:06:02,971 --> 02:06:04,097
What are they doing?

1726
02:06:08,143 --> 02:06:09,811
Herding them into a kill zone.

1727
02:06:42,886 --> 02:06:44,221
Captain, you gotta hurry.

1728
02:06:44,304 --> 02:06:46,556
Hang on, Lex.

1729
02:06:50,769 --> 02:06:52,604
Lexy!

1730
02:07:34,855 --> 02:07:36,022
There they are!

1731
02:08:02,466 --> 02:08:03,633
Morpheus!

1732
02:08:07,512 --> 02:08:09,222
Lex.

1733
02:08:09,306 --> 02:08:11,183
- Bugsy.
- Hell yeah!

1734
02:08:12,142 --> 02:08:13,769
Seq, where's Neo?

1735
02:08:13,852 --> 02:08:15,479
It's bad. They're pinned.

1736
02:08:15,562 --> 02:08:16,646
Heading to a roof.

1737
02:09:25,924 --> 02:09:27,175
Nodal fibrillation
is critical.

1738
02:09:27,259 --> 02:09:28,677
She'll die
if we don't extract.

1739
02:10:09,676 --> 02:10:12,304
It's so beautiful.

1740
02:10:27,611 --> 02:10:29,321
I remember this.

1741
02:10:31,406 --> 02:10:33,617
I remember us.

1742
02:10:51,718 --> 02:10:53,720
My dream ended here.

1743
02:11:04,606 --> 02:11:06,191
We can't go back.

1744
02:11:08,318 --> 02:11:09,402
We won't.

1745
02:11:28,672 --> 02:11:30,048
Can they make the jump?

1746
02:12:01,121 --> 02:12:02,747
I'm not doing this.

1747
02:12:02,831 --> 02:12:04,207
Are you doing this?

1748
02:12:28,314 --> 02:12:29,399
Bye.

1749
02:13:50,438 --> 02:13:52,023
How dramatic.

1750
02:13:52,857 --> 02:13:54,150
"Tiffany"?

1751
02:13:54,234 --> 02:13:57,195
It was a private joke.

1752
02:13:57,278 --> 02:13:58,822
An amusement, that's all.

1753
02:13:58,905 --> 02:14:01,241
An amusement? Hmm.

1754
02:14:02,992 --> 02:14:05,161
Whoa.

1755
02:14:05,245 --> 02:14:06,663
Kind of like that?

1756
02:14:10,917 --> 02:14:13,670
Okay. Ow.

1757
02:14:13,753 --> 02:14:15,213
If you hated the name so much,

1758
02:14:15,296 --> 02:14:17,465
why did you heel like
a good little bitch so long?

1759
02:14:20,593 --> 02:14:22,846
Yeah. Definitely asked
for that.

1760
02:14:28,143 --> 02:14:30,103
Can't you control her?

1761
02:14:35,942 --> 02:14:37,652
That was for using children.

1762
02:14:42,532 --> 02:14:44,033
We have a few questions.

1763
02:14:44,117 --> 02:14:45,952
You tried to activate
the fail-safe.

1764
02:14:46,035 --> 02:14:47,370
The Suits tried.

1765
02:14:47,453 --> 02:14:49,747
Obviously, without control
of your source code,

1766
02:14:49,831 --> 02:14:51,207
I knew that was impossible.

1767
02:14:51,291 --> 02:14:53,501
So, why haven't
the Suits purged you?

1768
02:14:54,377 --> 02:14:57,046
Because I know the system.

1769
02:14:57,130 --> 02:14:59,549
I know human beings.

1770
02:14:59,632 --> 02:15:01,801
And I know you.

1771
02:15:04,220 --> 02:15:06,764
Right now, you're feeling good
about what you've done.

1772
02:15:06,848 --> 02:15:09,267
You should.
It was a victory. Bravo.

1773
02:15:10,101 --> 02:15:11,436
Now what?

1774
02:15:11,519 --> 02:15:14,147
You've come here to negotiate
some kind of deal?

1775
02:15:14,230 --> 02:15:15,815
You think you hold
all the cards,

1776
02:15:15,899 --> 02:15:18,318
because you can do whatever
you want in this world.

1777
02:15:18,401 --> 02:15:20,737
I say, go for it.

1778
02:15:20,820 --> 02:15:23,406
Remake it.
Knock yourselves out.

1779
02:15:23,489 --> 02:15:25,533
Paint the sky with rainbows.

1780
02:15:25,617 --> 02:15:26,784
But here's the thing.

1781
02:15:26,868 --> 02:15:29,913
The sheeple aren't
going anywhere.

1782
02:15:29,996 --> 02:15:31,206
They like my world.

1783
02:15:31,289 --> 02:15:34,209
They don't want
this sentimentality.

1784
02:15:34,292 --> 02:15:36,211
They don't want
freedom or empowerment.

1785
02:15:36,294 --> 02:15:38,713
They want to be controlled.

1786
02:15:38,796 --> 02:15:40,757
They crave
the comfort of certainty.

1787
02:15:40,840 --> 02:15:43,593
And that means you two,
back in your pods,

1788
02:15:43,676 --> 02:15:47,222
unconscious and alone,
just like them.

1789
02:15:51,476 --> 02:15:54,187
We're not here
to negotiate anything.

1790
02:15:54,270 --> 02:15:56,522
We were on our way
to remake your world.

1791
02:15:56,606 --> 02:15:58,149
Change a few things.

1792
02:15:58,233 --> 02:15:59,442
I kind of like

1793
02:15:59,525 --> 02:16:00,860
the "paint the sky
with rainbows" idea.

1794
02:16:00,944 --> 02:16:02,862
Just remind people
what a free mind can do.

1795
02:16:02,946 --> 02:16:04,447
I forgot. It's easy to forget.

1796
02:16:04,530 --> 02:16:06,950
- He makes it easy.
- That, he does.

1797
02:16:07,033 --> 02:16:09,244
Something he should
think about.

1798
02:16:10,245 --> 02:16:11,454
Before we got started,

1799
02:16:11,537 --> 02:16:14,374
we decided to stop by
to say thank you.

1800
02:16:14,457 --> 02:16:17,543
You gave us something
we never thought we could have.

1801
02:16:17,627 --> 02:16:19,003
And what is that?

1802
02:16:19,879 --> 02:16:21,673
Another chance.

1803
02:27:24,919 --> 02:27:27,713
Face reality, people.
Movies are dead.

1804
02:27:27,796 --> 02:27:29,715
Games are dead.

1805
02:27:29,798 --> 02:27:31,550
Narrative? Dead.

1806
02:27:31,634 --> 02:27:33,594
Media is nothing
but neuro-trigger response

1807
02:27:33,677 --> 02:27:34,887
and viral conditioning.

1808
02:27:34,970 --> 02:27:36,472
Wait, what are you two
talking about?

1809
02:27:38,724 --> 02:27:40,559
Cat videos.

1810
02:27:40,643 --> 02:27:44,396
What we need is
a series of videos

1811
02:27:44,480 --> 02:27:46,815
that we call "The Catrix."
