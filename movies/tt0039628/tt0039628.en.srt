00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:19,480
- Hello, Mother!
- Hello, dear.

157
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:23,180
GAILEY: A cup of coffee?
You must be half frozen.

158
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,780
- Oh, don't bother.
- It's all ready.

159
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:28,724
DORIS: In that case, thanks.
What do you think of my parade?

160
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,727
SUZIE: It's much better
than last year's.

161
00:10:30,761 --> 00:10:32,422
DORIS: Well, I hope
Mr. Macy agrees with you.

162
00:10:32,463 --> 00:10:35,728
GAILEY: Sugar? Cream?
Both? Neither?

163
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:37,893
DORIS: Just one sugar, please.

164
00:10:40,437 --> 00:10:42,166
This is very kind of you,
Mr. Gailey.

165
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:43,468
GAILEY: Sit down.

166
00:10:43,507 --> 00:10:45,498
DORIS: I want to thank you
for being so kind to Susan.

167
00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:48,740
Cleo tells me you took them
to the zoo yesterday.

168
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,906
GAILEY: That's right,
but I must confess.

169
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:53,678
It's part of a deep-dyed plot.

170
00:10:53,717 --> 00:10:59,019
I'm fond of Suzie, very fond,
but I also wanted to meet you.

171
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:01,616
I read someplace the surest way
to meet the mother...

172
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:03,388
is to be kind to the child.

173
00:11:03,427 --> 00:11:05,520
DORIS: What a horrible trick.

174
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:07,531
GAILEY: It worked.

175
00:11:07,565 --> 00:11:09,692
SUZIE: There goes Santa Claus.

176
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:12,600
DORIS: Oh, don't even
mention the name.

177
00:11:12,636 --> 00:11:14,934
SUZIE: He's much better
than last year's.

178
00:11:14,972 --> 00:11:17,338
At least this one
doesn't wear glasses.

179
00:11:17,374 --> 00:11:19,467
DORIS: This one was
a last-minute substitute.

180
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,478
The one I hired I fired.

181
00:11:21,512 --> 00:11:22,809
SUZIE: Why?

182
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:25,748
DORIS: You remember
the janitor last New Year's?

183
00:11:25,783 --> 00:11:27,978
SUZIE: Ohh, yes.

184
00:11:28,018 --> 00:11:31,078
DORIS: Well,
this one was much worse.

185
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:32,383
SUZIE: Oh.

186
00:11:32,423 --> 00:11:35,085
GAILEY: I see she doesn't
believe in Santa Claus, either.

187
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,923
No Santa Claus,
no fairy tales...

188
00:11:37,962 --> 00:11:41,193
no fantasies of any kind,
is that it?

189
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:43,996
DORIS: That's right.
We should be realistic...

190
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:46,002
and completely truthful
with our children...

191
00:11:46,036 --> 00:11:47,503
and not have them growing up
believing in...

192
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:51,668
a lot of legends and myths
like Santa Claus, for example.

193
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:53,006
GAILEY: I see.

194
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:56,444
SUZIE: That's the end.
The acrobats were good.

195
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,505
DORIS: They ought to be
at those prices.

196
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,346
Thanks for the coffee.

197
00:12:00,384 --> 00:12:02,614
SUZIE: And thank you
for inviting me in.

198
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:05,053
GAILEY:
It was a pleasure, missy.

199
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:06,579
SUZIE: Mother, I was thinking...

200
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:08,615
we've got such
a big turkey for dinner...

201
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:10,627
and there are only two of us.

202
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:13,789
Couldn't we invite Mr. Gailey?

203
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:15,696
GAILEY: Oh, don't even
think about it.

204
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:17,860
I'll have a sandwich
or something.

205
00:12:17,902 --> 00:12:19,870
It's an awful big turkey.

206
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:21,132
DORIS: That's not it, dear...

207
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:23,833
but I'm sure Mr. Gailey
has other plans.

208
00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:26,001
No, he hasn't. Have you?

209
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:29,376
GAILEY: To be quite honest
and truthful with the child...

210
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:31,074
I must admit
I haven't any other plans.

211
00:12:31,115 --> 00:12:33,310
SUZIE: Please, Mother!

212
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,908
Did I ask all right?

213
00:12:34,952 --> 00:12:36,146
GAILEY: Hmm?

214
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,256
Didn't I ask all right,
Mr. Gailey?

215
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:45,888
GAILEY: That all depends.

216
00:12:47,564 --> 00:12:49,191
DORIS: Dinner's at 3:00.

217
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:51,224
GAILEY: Thanks.

218
00:12:51,268 --> 00:12:53,668
Suzie, honey,
you asked just right.

219
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:55,535
I'll see you at 3:00.

220
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,031
- It worked.
- Yes.

221
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,108
SHELLHAMMER: I tell you,
Mrs. Walker, he's stupendous.

222
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,277
Everybody's crazy about him.
So is Mr. Macy.

223
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:10,219
DORIS: Well, hire him,
by all means.

224
00:13:10,254 --> 00:13:11,778
It's perfectly
all right with me.

225
00:13:11,822 --> 00:13:15,155
It'll save me a frantic search
in the morning.

226
00:13:17,161 --> 00:13:19,220
Yes. That's right.

227
00:13:19,263 --> 00:13:21,356
I'll take care of it as soon
as he gets through.

228
00:13:21,398 --> 00:13:22,524
You'll love him.

229
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:24,295
I just know that
with that man on the throne...

230
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:26,360
my department will sell
more toys than it ever has.

231
00:13:26,403 --> 00:13:28,394
He's a born salesman.
I just feel it.

232
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:29,701
DORIS: Yes, yes, yes.

233
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,833
We'll talk about it
in the morning. Good-bye.

234
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,035
Good-bye.

235
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:39,208
And you'll find toys
of all kinds at Macy's.

236
00:13:52,196 --> 00:13:54,494
ALFRED: Gee, that sure is
an elegant costume.

237
00:13:54,531 --> 00:13:58,900
KRIS: Yes. I've had it
for years and years.

238
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:01,769
ALFRED: Sure makes a bum
out of the one they gave you.

239
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:03,796
Even that one's better
than the one I wear.

240
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:05,103
KRIS: You, Alfred?

241
00:14:05,142 --> 00:14:08,043
ALFRED: I play Santa Claus
over at the "Y" near our block.

242
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:09,204
KRIS: No kidding!

243
00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:11,214
Started about three years ago.

244
00:14:11,248 --> 00:14:15,446
They had a costume,
but it didn't have no padding...

245
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:17,954
and since I carry my own
padding around with me...

246
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:19,546
I got the job, see?

247
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,114
[Chuckles]

248
00:14:21,158 --> 00:14:23,149
You enjoy impersonating me?

249
00:14:23,193 --> 00:14:26,185
- Oh, yeah.
- Why?

250
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,460
I don't know. It's...

251
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:30,865
When I give packages
to little kids...

252
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:33,597
I like to watch
their faces get that...

253
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:35,628
that Christmas look
all of a sudden.

254
00:14:35,672 --> 00:14:38,505
It makes me feel
kind of good and important.

255
00:14:43,013 --> 00:14:44,480
WOMAN: Pardon me!

256
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:46,244
BUSINESSMAN: I bought
a 23-pound turkey.

257
00:14:46,283 --> 00:14:49,548
I had my daughter and her kids
over for dinner yesterday.

258
00:14:52,656 --> 00:14:54,681
SHELLHAMMER: There you are.

259
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:55,851
KRIS: Good morning.

260
00:14:55,893 --> 00:14:58,487
SHELLHAMMER: Oh, my,
what a striking costume!

261
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:00,656
Before you go up on the floor,
I want to give you...

262
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:02,700
a few tips on how to be
a good Santa Claus.

263
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,061
KRIS: Go right ahead.

264
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:06,934
SHELLHAMMER: Here's a list
of toys that we have to push.

265
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,632
You know, things
that we're overstocked on.

266
00:15:09,673 --> 00:15:11,140
Now, you'll find
that a great many children...

267
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:13,575
will be undecided as to what
they want for Christmas.

268
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:18,070
When that happens,
you suggest one of these items.

269
00:15:18,115 --> 00:15:19,241
You understand?

270
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:20,978
KRIS: I certainly do.

271
00:15:21,018 --> 00:15:23,987
SHELLHAMMER: Good.
You memorize that list...

272
00:15:24,021 --> 00:15:25,989
Oh, no. 9:50.

273
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:28,491
When you've finished,
come up to the seventh floor.

274
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:29,924
I'll be waiting for you.

275
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:34,292
KRIS: Imagine...

276
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:37,198
making a child take something
it doesn't want...

277
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:40,328
just because he bought
too many of the wrong toys.

278
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,430
That's what I've been
fighting against for years...

279
00:15:43,474 --> 00:15:45,465
the way they
commercialize Christmas.

280
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:48,672
ALFRED: A lot of bad "isms"
floating around this world...

281
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:50,612
but one of the worst
is commercialism.

282
00:15:50,647 --> 00:15:52,342
Make a buck. Make a buck.

283
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:54,350
Even in Brooklyn,
it's the same.

284
00:15:54,384 --> 00:15:56,545
Don't care what Christmas
stands for.

285
00:15:56,587 --> 00:15:59,055
Just make a buck.

286
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:01,148
Oh, don't bother.
I'll put it away for you.

287
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:03,352
KRIS: Eh?
Oh, thank you, Alfred.

288
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:06,728
And what should I do
with these?

289
00:16:06,764 --> 00:16:08,789
Throw them on the floor.

290
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:11,027
I get kind of tired
just sweeping up dust.

291
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:12,262
KRIS: Mm-hmm.

292
00:16:13,504 --> 00:16:16,337
- Thanks.
- Well, thank you, Alfred.

293
00:16:23,347 --> 00:16:26,976
KRIS: Yes, yes, yes.
Peter's a fine name.

294
00:16:27,017 --> 00:16:28,382
What do you want
for Christmas, Peter?

295
00:16:28,418 --> 00:16:31,819
PETER: A fire engine, just like
the big ones only smaller...

296
00:16:31,855 --> 00:16:33,846
that has a real hose
that squirts real water.

297
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:36,655
I won't do it in the house,
only in the backyard.

298
00:16:36,693 --> 00:16:38,285
I promise.

299
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:39,989
WOMAN: Psst! Psst!

300
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:43,056
Macy's ain't got any.
Nobody's got any.

301
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,660
KRIS: Well, Peter,
I can tell you're a good boy.

302
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:46,930
You'll get your fire engine.

303
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,837
PETER:
Oh, thank you very much!

304
00:16:49,873 --> 00:16:53,104
You see?
I told you he'd get me one.

305
00:16:53,143 --> 00:16:55,111
WOMAN: That's fine.
That's just dandy.

306
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:56,669
Listen, you wait over there.

307
00:16:56,713 --> 00:17:00,149
Mama wants to thank
Santa Claus, too.

308
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:02,618
Say, listen,
what's the matter with you?

309
00:17:02,653 --> 00:17:04,143
Don't you understand English?

310
00:17:04,188 --> 00:17:07,180
I tell you nobody's got any.

311
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:09,522
I've been all over.
My feet are killing me.

312
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,528
A fine thing, promising the kid.

313
00:17:11,562 --> 00:17:14,895
KRIS: You don't think I would've
said that unless I'm sure?

314
00:17:14,932 --> 00:17:18,732
You can get those fire engines
at Schoenfeld's on Lexington.

315
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:20,703
Only 8.50. A wonderful bargain.

316
00:17:20,737 --> 00:17:23,103
WOMAN: Schoenfeld's?
I don't get it.

317
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,973
KRIS: I keep track of
the toy market pretty closely.

318
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:27,340
Does that surprise you so?

319
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:28,969
WOMAN: Surprise me?

320
00:17:29,012 --> 00:17:31,503
Macy's sending people
to other stores?

321
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:32,845
Are you kidding me?

322
00:17:32,883 --> 00:17:35,818
KRIS: The only important thing
is to make the children happy.

323
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:38,913
Who sells the toy
doesn't make any difference.

324
00:17:38,956 --> 00:17:40,514
Don't you feel that way?

325
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:43,025
Who, me? Oh, yeah, sure.

326
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,789
Only I didn't know Macy's did.

327
00:17:44,828 --> 00:17:46,591
KRIS:
As long as I'm here, they do.

328
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,495
WOMAN: I don't get it.

329
00:17:48,532 --> 00:17:52,059
No, I just don't get it.

330
00:18:12,823 --> 00:18:14,290
KRIS: I quite understand.

331
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:16,121
Your little girl
would like some skates.

332
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:17,751
But of course,
you must get her the best...

333
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:20,194
'cause their little ankles
want protecting.

334
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,597
Our skates are very good,
but not quite good enough.

335
00:18:23,634 --> 00:18:25,659
You go to Gimbels.

336
00:18:25,702 --> 00:18:27,226
They'll have exactly what
you're looking for.

337
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:29,637
There you are, dear.
That's for you.

338
00:18:29,673 --> 00:18:30,799
Merry Christmas.

339
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:32,001
SHELLHAMMER: Gimbels.

340
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:35,705
KRIS: Hello, my little girl.
How old are you?

341
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:40,111
Gimbels.

342
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,311
Gimbels!

343
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:44,183
WOMAN: Pardon me.
The guard said to speak to you.

344
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:45,688
You're the head
of the toy department?

345
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:47,189
SHELLHAMMER: Yes, madam...

346
00:18:47,224 --> 00:18:49,920
WOMAN: Listen. I want to
congratulate you and Macy's...

347
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,485
on this wonderful new stunt
you're pulling.

348
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:55,123
Imagine, sending people
to other stores.

349
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:56,826
I don't get it. Why, it's...

350
00:18:56,867 --> 00:18:59,427
- It certainly is.
- You said it.

351
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:01,596
Imagine a big outfit
like Macy's...

352
00:19:01,638 --> 00:19:04,163
putting the spirit of Christmas
ahead of the commercial.

353
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:06,004
It's wonderful.

354
00:19:06,043 --> 00:19:08,102
I never done
much shopping here before...

355
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:12,343
but from now on, I'm going
to be a regular Macy customer.

356
00:19:12,382 --> 00:19:13,781
All right, dear.

357
00:19:13,817 --> 00:19:15,444
SHELLHAMMER: Thank you, madam.

358
00:19:18,855 --> 00:19:21,756
SECRETARY: There are six more
women who want to thank you.

359
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:25,057
Not now. I've got
to think this thing over.

360
00:19:25,095 --> 00:19:28,223
Personally, I think
it's a wonderful idea, too.

361
00:19:28,265 --> 00:19:31,132
You think so.
Those women think so.

362
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:34,103
The point is,
will Mr. Macy think so?

363
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:40,469
SUZIE: This seems awfully silly,
Mr. Gailey.

364
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,274
GAILEY: I thought as long
as we're in the store...

365
00:19:43,313 --> 00:19:45,474
you might as well
say hello to Santa Claus.

366
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:46,982
SUZIE: Why?

367
00:19:47,017 --> 00:19:49,144
GAILEY: Because when
you talk to him...

368
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:51,279
you might feel
differently about him.

369
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,829
KRIS: Good-bye, Elmer.
Be a good boy now.

370
00:19:59,863 --> 00:20:01,125
Merry Christmas!

371
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:03,689
Well, young lady,
what's your name?

372
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:05,895
SUZIE: Susan Walker.
What's yours?

373
00:20:05,936 --> 00:20:08,131
KRIS: Mine? Kris Kringle.

374
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:10,139
I'm Santa Claus.

375
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:13,506
Oh, you don't believe that,
do you?

376
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:17,604
SUZIE: My mother's Mrs. Walker,
the lady who hired you.

377
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:19,114
KRIS: Oh.

378
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:22,209
SUZIE: But I must say,
you're the best one I've seen.

379
00:20:22,252 --> 00:20:23,514
KRIS: Really?

380
00:20:23,553 --> 00:20:26,113
SUZIE: Your beard doesn't have
those things over your ears.

381
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:29,319
KRIS: That's because it's real,
like I'm really Santa Claus.

382
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,528
Oh, go ahead, pull it.

383
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,161
Ouch.

384
00:20:37,901 --> 00:20:39,835
CLERK: All right, folks,
don't crowd.

385
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,531
You have all day
to see Santa Claus.

386
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:43,937
Now, children, behave.
This way, please.

387
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:45,373
Get back in the line there.

388
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:48,435
KRIS: What would you like me
to bring you for Christmas?

389
00:20:48,478 --> 00:20:50,378
SUZIE: Nothing, thank you.

390
00:20:50,414 --> 00:20:52,609
KRIS: Oh, come now.
You must want something.

391
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:54,981
SUZIE: Whatever I want,
my mother will get for me...

392
00:20:55,018 --> 00:20:57,486
if it's sensible and doesn't
cost too much, of course.

393
00:20:57,521 --> 00:20:58,647
Hello, Mother.

394
00:20:58,688 --> 00:21:00,121
DORIS: Hello, Susan, Mr. Gailey.

395
00:21:00,157 --> 00:21:03,490
I think you've taken up enough
of this gentleman's time.

396
00:21:03,527 --> 00:21:06,826
GAILEY: The explanation for this
is all very simple.

397
00:21:06,863 --> 00:21:08,490
Cleo's mother
sprained her ankle.

398
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:11,000
She had to go home and asked me
to bring Suzie down to you.

399
00:21:11,034 --> 00:21:13,525
DORIS: Yes, Cleo called me.
I was wondering where you were.

400
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,232
GAILEY: As long as we're here,
we should say hello to Santa.

401
00:21:16,273 --> 00:21:19,970
SUZIE: He's a nice old man,
and those whiskers are real.

402
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,979
DORIS: Yes, dear. Many men
have long beards like that.

403
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:24,844
Susan, would you stand
over here a minute?

404
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:27,349
I want to talk to Mr. Gailey.

405
00:21:27,384 --> 00:21:30,353
GAILEY: I shouldn't have brought
Suzie to see Santa Claus?

406
00:21:30,387 --> 00:21:33,322
DORIS: You're making me feel
like the proverbial stepmother.

407
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:35,517
GAILEY: I'm sorry, but I just
couldn't see any harm...

408
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:37,459
in just saying hello
to the old fellow.

409
00:21:37,494 --> 00:21:39,359
DORIS:
But I think there is harm.

410
00:21:39,396 --> 00:21:41,990
I tell her Santa Claus is
a myth, you bring her here...

411
00:21:42,032 --> 00:21:44,159
and she sees hundreds
of gullible children...

412
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:47,102
meets a very convincing
old man with real whiskers.

413
00:21:47,137 --> 00:21:50,368
This sets up a very harmful
mental conflict within her.

414
00:21:50,407 --> 00:21:53,069
What is she going to think?
Who is she going to believe?

415
00:21:58,715 --> 00:22:00,205
And by filling them
full of fairy tales...

416
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,651
they grow up considering life
a fantasy instead of a reality.

417
00:22:03,687 --> 00:22:06,656
They keep waiting for
Prince Charming to come along.

418
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,658
And when he does,
he turns out to be a...

419
00:22:08,692 --> 00:22:11,490
GAILEY: We were talking
about Suzie, not about you.

420
00:22:11,528 --> 00:22:13,325
DORIS:
Whether you agree or not...

421
00:22:13,363 --> 00:22:16,594
I must ask you to respect
my wishes regarding Susan.

422
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:18,430
She's my responsibility...

423
00:22:18,468 --> 00:22:20,333
and I must bring her up
as I see fit.

424
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,530
GAILEY: OK.

425
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:31,337
- Say "Thank you."
- Thank you.

426
00:22:31,381 --> 00:22:33,076
KRIS: Bye. Merry Christmas!

427
00:22:35,652 --> 00:22:37,779
Well, young lady,
what's your name?

428
00:22:37,821 --> 00:22:39,914
MOTHER: I'm sorry.
She doesn't speak English.

429
00:22:39,956 --> 00:22:42,754
She's Dutch. She just came over.

430
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:44,851
She's been living
in an orphans home...

431
00:22:44,894 --> 00:22:47,522
in Rotterdam ever since...

432
00:22:47,564 --> 00:22:48,792
We've adopted her.

433
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,323
I told her you wouldn't
be able to speak to her...

434
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:53,336
but when she saw you
in the parade yesterday...

435
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,998
she said you were
"Sinter Claes"...

436
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,973
and you could talk to her.

437
00:22:58,008 --> 00:22:59,134
I didn't know what to do.

438
00:22:59,175 --> 00:23:02,144
KRIS: Hello. [Speaking Dutch]

439
00:23:02,178 --> 00:23:04,578
[Speaking Dutch]

440
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:28,627
[Singing in Dutch]

441
00:23:48,391 --> 00:23:50,018
DORIS: Now do you understand?

442
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,857
SUZIE: Yes, I see what
you mean, Mother.

443
00:23:51,895 --> 00:23:53,123
DORIS: Good.

444
00:23:53,163 --> 00:23:56,564
SUZIE: But when he spoke Dutch
to that girl, he was so...

445
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:00,057
DORIS: Susan, I speak French,
but I'm not Joan of Arc.

446
00:24:00,103 --> 00:24:03,072
What I'm trying
to explain is... Come in.

447
00:24:03,106 --> 00:24:04,937
KRIS: They said you wanted
to see me, Mrs. Walker.

448
00:24:04,974 --> 00:24:06,441
DORIS: Come right in.

449
00:24:06,476 --> 00:24:08,034
KRIS: Hello there!
Good to see you again.

450
00:24:08,078 --> 00:24:09,443
SUZIE: It's nice to see you.

451
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:10,878
KRIS: You're awfully lucky,
Mrs. Walker.

452
00:24:10,914 --> 00:24:12,643
Lovely little girl
you have here.

453
00:24:12,682 --> 00:24:15,617
DORIS: Thank you. Susan's why
I asked you to drop down.

454
00:24:15,652 --> 00:24:16,949
She's a little confused...

455
00:24:16,986 --> 00:24:18,510
and I thought you could help
straighten her out.

456
00:24:18,555 --> 00:24:19,817
KRIS: Oh, glad to.

457
00:24:19,856 --> 00:24:23,690
Would you please tell her
you're not really Santa Claus...

458
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:26,355
that there actually
is no such person?

459
00:24:26,396 --> 00:24:28,330
KRIS: I'm sorry to disagree
with you, Mrs. Walker.

460
00:24:28,364 --> 00:24:31,197
Not only is there such a person,
but here I am to prove it.

461
00:24:31,234 --> 00:24:33,293
No, you misunderstand.

462
00:24:33,336 --> 00:24:36,305
I want you to tell her
the truth. What's your name?

463
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:38,364
Kris Kringle. I'll bet
you're in the first grade.

464
00:24:38,408 --> 00:24:39,534
SUZIE: Second.

465
00:24:39,576 --> 00:24:41,203
I mean your real name.

466
00:24:41,244 --> 00:24:43,508
That is my real name.
Second grade?

467
00:24:43,546 --> 00:24:44,945
SUZIE:
It's a progressive school.

468
00:24:44,981 --> 00:24:47,643
KRIS: Oh,
it's a progressive school.

469
00:24:47,684 --> 00:24:50,084
DORIS: May I have this man's
employment card, please?

470
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,246
WOMAN: Yes, Mrs. Walker.

471
00:24:51,287 --> 00:24:52,720
KRIS: This dress is very cute.

472
00:24:52,756 --> 00:24:54,621
Where did you get
such a lovely outfit?

473
00:24:54,657 --> 00:24:57,387
SUZIE: Here at Macy's.
We get 10% off.

474
00:24:57,427 --> 00:25:00,396
DORIS: Please don't feel
you have to pretend for Susan.

475
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,364
She's a very
intelligent child...

476
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:04,491
and always wants to know
the absolute truth.

477
00:25:04,534 --> 00:25:06,434
KRIS: Good, because I always
tell the absolute truth.

478
00:25:06,469 --> 00:25:09,461
About your school...
What's the name of your teacher?

479
00:25:09,506 --> 00:25:11,599
SUZIE: Mrs. Haley.

480
00:25:11,641 --> 00:25:14,235
- Here it is, Mrs. Walker.
- Thank you.

481
00:25:14,277 --> 00:25:16,643
KRIS: What else do you do
besides read and play games?

482
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,842
SUZIE: We have rest periods
for one half-hour.

483
00:25:19,883 --> 00:25:21,976
KRIS: I don't suppose
you care for that, eh?

484
00:25:22,018 --> 00:25:25,146
SUZIE: No. We're not allowed
to talk or anything.

485
00:25:25,188 --> 00:25:28,624
SUZIE: Tuesday, Chester Richards
kept talking all the time.

486
00:25:28,658 --> 00:25:30,717
KRIS: My, that was bad, eh?

487
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,287
SUZIE: Mrs. Haley made him rest
all alone for nearly an hour.

488
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:38,494
DORIS: Susan, would you go out
and talk to Miss Adams?

489
00:25:38,535 --> 00:25:40,162
I'll be right with you.

490
00:25:40,203 --> 00:25:41,670
SUZIE: All right. Good-bye.

491
00:25:41,704 --> 00:25:43,501
KRIS: Good-bye, young lady.
Hope to see you again.

492
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,838
SUZIE: Thank you.
I hope so, too. Bye.

493
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:47,001
KRIS: Good-bye.

494
00:25:47,043 --> 00:25:50,501
DORIS:
I'm sorry, Mr., uh... Mr...

495
00:25:50,547 --> 00:25:51,844
KRIS: Kringle.

496
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:53,849
DORIS: I'm sorry, but we're
going to have to make a change.

497
00:25:53,883 --> 00:25:55,009
KRIS: Change?

498
00:25:55,051 --> 00:25:57,178
DORIS: The Santa Claus
that we had two years ago...

499
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,347
is back in town,
and I feel we owe it to him...

500
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:00,856
KRIS:
Have I done something wrong?

501
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,949
DORIS: Oh, no, no.

502
00:26:02,992 --> 00:26:04,619
Well...

503
00:26:04,661 --> 00:26:06,219
[Buzz]

504
00:26:06,262 --> 00:26:07,388
DORIS: Yes?

505
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,955
WOMAN: Mr. Macy wants
to see you immediately.

506
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:11,489
DORIS: I'll be right up.

507
00:26:13,503 --> 00:26:15,164
DORIS: Would you sit down...

508
00:26:15,205 --> 00:26:18,299
and I'll be right back
and sign your pay voucher.

509
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:21,476
SECRETARY: Yes, indeed.

510
00:26:21,511 --> 00:26:25,038
Go right in.
Mr. Macy's waiting.

511
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:29,017
MACY: The effect this will
have on the public is...

512
00:26:29,052 --> 00:26:30,451
Come in, Mrs. Walker.

513
00:26:30,486 --> 00:26:34,286
- Hello, Mrs. Walker.
- Sit over here.

514
00:26:34,324 --> 00:26:37,452
MACY: I've been telling these
gentlemen the new policy...

515
00:26:37,493 --> 00:26:39,154
you and Mr. Shellhammer
initiated.

516
00:26:39,195 --> 00:26:41,959
I can't say that I approve
of your not consulting...

517
00:26:41,998 --> 00:26:43,863
the advertising department
first...

518
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,301
but in the face of this
tremendous public response...

519
00:26:47,337 --> 00:26:49,305
I can't be angry with you.

520
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:51,671
- What's he talking about?
- Tell you later.

521
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:53,073
MACY:
Now, to continue, gentlemen.

522
00:26:53,109 --> 00:26:56,875
I admit this plan sounds
idiotic and impossible.

523
00:26:56,913 --> 00:27:00,576
Imagine Macy's Santa Claus
sending customers to Gimbels.

524
00:27:00,617 --> 00:27:05,213
Ho ho. But, gentlemen,
you cannot argue with success.

525
00:27:05,255 --> 00:27:07,246
Look at this.

526
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,258
Telegrams,
messages, telephone calls.

527
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:11,283
The governor's wife,
the mayor's wife...

528
00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:13,295
over 500 thankful parents...

529
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:15,559
expressing
undying gratitude to Macy's.

530
00:27:15,598 --> 00:27:18,032
Never in my entire career...

531
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:20,433
have I seen such a tremendous
and immediate response...

532
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,199
to a merchandising policy.

533
00:27:22,238 --> 00:27:25,935
And I'm positive, Frank,
if we expand our policy...

534
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:27,943
we'll expand
our results as well.

535
00:27:27,977 --> 00:27:30,502
Therefore, from now on...

536
00:27:30,546 --> 00:27:32,946
not only will our Santa Claus
continue in this manner...

537
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:35,712
but I want every salesperson
in this store...

538
00:27:35,752 --> 00:27:37,549
to do precisely the same thing.

539
00:27:37,587 --> 00:27:40,457
If we haven't got exactly
what the customer wants...

540
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,649
we'll send him
where he can get it.

541
00:27:42,692 --> 00:27:44,660
No high pressuring
and forcing a customer...

542
00:27:44,694 --> 00:27:46,321
to take something
he doesn't really want.

543
00:27:46,362 --> 00:27:49,695
We'll be known
as the helpful store...

544
00:27:49,732 --> 00:27:52,394
the friendly store,
the store with a heart...

545
00:27:52,435 --> 00:27:56,098
the store that places
public service ahead of profits.

546
00:27:56,139 --> 00:27:59,108
And, consequently, we'll make
more profits than ever before.

547
00:27:59,142 --> 00:28:01,978
Yes, I know it's late,
and we're all tired...

548
00:28:01,978 --> 00:28:03,377
and we want to go to dinner...

549
00:28:03,413 --> 00:28:05,643
so we'll continue first thing
in the morning.

550
00:28:05,682 --> 00:28:07,912
In the meantime,
you fellas get together...

551
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:10,112
and figure out the best way
to promote this thing.

552
00:28:10,153 --> 00:28:12,348
ADVERTISING EXECUTIVE:
We'll do that. Good night, R.H.

553
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:13,514
MACY: Good night.

554
00:28:13,556 --> 00:28:16,753
I want to thank you two again.

555
00:28:16,793 --> 00:28:18,454
And in your
Christmas envelopes...

556
00:28:18,495 --> 00:28:21,157
you'll find a more practical
expression of my gratitude.

557
00:28:21,197 --> 00:28:22,323
SHELLHAMMER:
Thank you, Mr. Macy.

558
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:24,356
MACY: Tell that Santa
I won't forget him, either.

559
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,300
SHELLHAMMER: Yes, Mr. Macy.

560
00:28:29,906 --> 00:28:32,602
SHELLHAMMER: Imagine, a bonus!

561
00:28:32,642 --> 00:28:35,873
He just assumed it was our idea.
What's the matter?

562
00:28:35,912 --> 00:28:37,903
- I fired him.
- Who?

563
00:28:37,947 --> 00:28:40,177
- Santa Claus.
- What?

564
00:28:40,216 --> 00:28:42,377
DORIS: He's crazy.
He thinks he is Santa Claus.

565
00:28:42,418 --> 00:28:44,648
SHELLHAMMER: I don't care if
he thinks he's the Easter Bunny.

566
00:28:44,687 --> 00:28:45,881
Get him back.

567
00:28:45,922 --> 00:28:47,412
DORIS: He's insane, I tell you.

568
00:28:47,457 --> 00:28:49,891
We'll hire somebody else
and have him do the same thing.

569
00:28:49,926 --> 00:28:52,451
SHELLHAMMER: You heard Mr. Macy.
We've got to keep him.

570
00:28:52,495 --> 00:28:54,656
DORIS: What if he should have
a sudden fit?

571
00:28:54,697 --> 00:28:56,892
Oh, no.
I've got to tell Mr. Macy.

572
00:28:56,933 --> 00:28:59,401
SHELLHAMMER: But maybe
he's only a little crazy...

573
00:28:59,435 --> 00:29:01,403
like painters or composers...

574
00:29:01,437 --> 00:29:03,337
or some of those men
in Washington.

575
00:29:03,373 --> 00:29:05,307
We can't be sure
until he's been examined.

576
00:29:05,341 --> 00:29:08,708
If you fire him, and we find out
he wasn't really crazy...

577
00:29:08,745 --> 00:29:12,112
Mr. Macy will have us
examined and fired.

578
00:29:12,148 --> 00:29:14,446
DORIS: I suppose
we ought to be sure.

579
00:29:14,484 --> 00:29:16,349
We could if Mr. Sawyer
talked to him.

580
00:29:16,386 --> 00:29:18,115
SHELLHAMMER: Of course.
He's a psychologist.

581
00:29:18,154 --> 00:29:20,588
He's paid to examine employees.

582
00:29:20,623 --> 00:29:23,421
Until we get his report,
we won't say a word.

583
00:29:23,459 --> 00:29:25,859
DORIS: I'll get in touch
with him right away.

584
00:29:25,895 --> 00:29:27,692
SHELLHAMMER: First,
get that Santa Claus back!

585
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:30,096
The examination is worthless
without the patient.

586
00:29:31,434 --> 00:29:34,130
DORIS: It was just because
I felt we owed it to him...

587
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,730
but Mr. Macy suggested
that we find something else...

588
00:29:36,773 --> 00:29:39,901
for the other Santa Claus
and keep you on by all means.

589
00:29:39,943 --> 00:29:43,003
KRIS: Oh, well, thanks.
That's mighty good news.

590
00:29:43,046 --> 00:29:45,446
DORIS: You'll be here
in the morning then?

591
00:29:45,481 --> 00:29:46,607
KRIS: Certainly I will.

592
00:29:46,649 --> 00:29:49,447
Mrs. Walker, this is
quite an opportunity for me.

593
00:29:49,485 --> 00:29:51,419
For the past 50 years or so...

594
00:29:51,454 --> 00:29:53,649
I've been getting more
worried about Christmas.

595
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:57,387
Seems we're all so busy trying
to beat the other fellow...

596
00:29:57,427 --> 00:30:00,419
in making things go faster,
look shinier, and cost less...

597
00:30:00,463 --> 00:30:03,660
that Christmas and I are sort of
getting lost in the shuffle.

598
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,498
DORIS: I don't think so.
Christmas is still Christmas.

599
00:30:06,536 --> 00:30:08,663
KRIS:
Christmas isn't just a day.

600
00:30:08,705 --> 00:30:11,731
It's a frame of mind.
That's what's been changing.

601
00:30:11,774 --> 00:30:14,937
That's why I'm glad I'm here.
Maybe I can do something.

602
00:30:14,978 --> 00:30:16,673
And I'm glad
I met you and your daughter.

603
00:30:16,713 --> 00:30:18,738
You two are a test case for me.

604
00:30:18,781 --> 00:30:20,078
DORIS: We are?

605
00:30:20,116 --> 00:30:22,676
KRIS: Yes. You're sort of
the whole thing in miniature.

606
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:25,688
If I can win you over,
there's still hope.

607
00:30:25,722 --> 00:30:29,488
If not,
then I guess I'm through.

608
00:30:29,525 --> 00:30:32,722
But I'm warning you,
I don't give up easily.

609
00:30:32,762 --> 00:30:34,252
Good night.

610
00:30:34,297 --> 00:30:35,423
DORIS: Good night.

611
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:37,797
Oh, Mr. Kringle,
first thing in the morning...

612
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:40,098
would you report
to Mr. Sawyer's office?

613
00:30:40,136 --> 00:30:42,900
He'll give you
a little examination.

614
00:30:42,939 --> 00:30:45,703
Oh, we do it
with all our employees.

615
00:30:45,742 --> 00:30:47,539
KRIS: A mental examination?

616
00:30:48,745 --> 00:30:50,770
Well...

617
00:30:50,813 --> 00:30:53,509
KRIS: I don't mind.
I've taken dozens of them.

618
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:56,609
Never failed one yet.
Know them by heart.

619
00:30:56,653 --> 00:31:00,350
- How many days in the week?
- Seven.

620
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,950
- How many fingers do you see?
- Four.

621
00:31:02,992 --> 00:31:04,983
Muscular coordination test.

622
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:11,162
No damage
to the nervous system.

623
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,600
Who was the first president
of the United States?

624
00:31:13,636 --> 00:31:14,967
George Washington.

625
00:31:15,004 --> 00:31:18,269
Who was vice president
under John Quincy Adams?

626
00:31:19,275 --> 00:31:21,607
Daniel D. Tompkins.

627
00:31:21,644 --> 00:31:23,976
I'll bet your Mr. Sawyer
doesn't know that.

628
00:31:24,013 --> 00:31:25,173
Good night.

629
00:31:38,294 --> 00:31:40,228
Miss Adams, would you get me...

630
00:31:40,263 --> 00:31:43,494
the Brooks' Memorial Home
in Great Neck?

631
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:46,161
It's a home for old people.
That's right.

632
00:31:46,202 --> 00:31:48,693
I want to talk
to the doctor in charge.

633
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,008
- How many days in the week?
- Seven.

634
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:02,574
SAWYER: The first president
of the United States?

635
00:32:02,618 --> 00:32:03,744
KRIS: George Washington.

636
00:32:03,786 --> 00:32:05,083
SAWYER: Three times five?

637
00:32:05,121 --> 00:32:07,749
You asked me that before.
The answer's at the bottom...

638
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,951
I'm conducting this examination.

639
00:32:09,992 --> 00:32:11,789
How much is three times five?

640
00:32:11,828 --> 00:32:14,695
Same as before... 15.

641
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,928
You're rather nervous,
aren't you, Mr. Sawyer?

642
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,631
Do you get enough sleep?

643
00:32:22,672 --> 00:32:24,663
SAWYER: My personal habits
are of no concern to you.

644
00:32:24,707 --> 00:32:27,835
KRIS: Oh, I'm sorry.
I hate to see someone tied up...

645
00:32:27,877 --> 00:32:30,505
- How many fingers do you see?
- Three.

646
00:32:30,546 --> 00:32:33,037
You bite your nails, too.
Tsk tsk tsk.

647
00:32:33,082 --> 00:32:36,415
I want you to stand
with your feet together...

648
00:32:36,452 --> 00:32:38,477
and your arms extended.
Then I want you to...

649
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:39,988
KRIS:
Muscular coordination test?

650
00:32:40,022 --> 00:32:43,389
Surely. Be glad to. Ha ha.

651
00:32:45,695 --> 00:32:49,153
KRIS: Sometimes the cause
of nervous habits like yours...

652
00:32:49,198 --> 00:32:51,496
is not obvious. No.

653
00:32:51,534 --> 00:32:54,401
Often they're the result
of an insecurity.

654
00:32:54,437 --> 00:32:56,064
Are you happy at home?

655
00:32:56,105 --> 00:32:57,538
SAWYER: That will be all!

656
00:32:57,573 --> 00:32:59,768
The examination's over.
You may go.

657
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:00,935
KRIS: Thank you.

658
00:33:00,977 --> 00:33:02,308
SAWYER:
You may go out that way.

659
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:07,472
And it may
interest you to know...

660
00:33:07,517 --> 00:33:09,849
that I've been happily
married for 26 years.

661
00:33:09,886 --> 00:33:12,946
Really? Delighted to hear it.

662
00:33:12,989 --> 00:33:14,354
Good-bye.

663
00:33:18,995 --> 00:33:20,121
Get me Mrs. Walker.

664
00:33:20,163 --> 00:33:22,893
Yes, sir. Your wife's on 672.

665
00:33:22,932 --> 00:33:24,729
She says it's very important.

666
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:30,471
How many times have I told you
not to bother me at the office?

667
00:33:30,506 --> 00:33:33,475
No. Not a penny.
I give you a liberal allowance.

668
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:35,170
It's up to you
to run the house on it.

669
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:37,179
If your stupid brother
would get a job...

670
00:33:37,213 --> 00:33:39,374
you wouldn't have to
pester me all the time.

671
00:33:39,415 --> 00:33:41,883
[Buzz]

672
00:33:41,918 --> 00:33:45,354
Mrs. Walker, I'd like to talk
to you about this Kringle.

673
00:33:45,388 --> 00:33:48,482
Oh, yes. Dr. Pierce
from the Brooks' home is here.

674
00:33:48,524 --> 00:33:50,389
It would be a good time
to settle the matter.

675
00:33:50,426 --> 00:33:52,485
Sorry, Doctor,
but that was Mr. Sawyer...

676
00:33:52,528 --> 00:33:54,519
the gentleman
I was telling you about.

677
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:56,725
He's just down the hall.

678
00:33:56,766 --> 00:34:00,258
I can't tell you how
we appreciate your time.

679
00:34:00,303 --> 00:34:03,500
PIERCE: Matter of fact,
I was going to call you today.

680
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:07,305
I had a feeling about now
you'd be wondering about Kris.

681
00:34:07,343 --> 00:34:10,278
DORIS: Dr. Pierce, Mr. Sawyer.

682
00:34:10,313 --> 00:34:11,610
PIERCE: How do you do?

683
00:34:11,647 --> 00:34:14,445
SAWYER: After giving this man
a comprehensive examination...

684
00:34:14,483 --> 00:34:16,508
it's my opinion he should
be dismissed immediately.

685
00:34:16,552 --> 00:34:19,919
Really? He failed
to pass the examination?

686
00:34:19,956 --> 00:34:22,447
- Yes.
- He didn't answer correctly?

687
00:34:22,491 --> 00:34:25,460
SAWYER: Yes, he did,
but he lacked concentration.

688
00:34:25,494 --> 00:34:27,962
He kept changing the subject.
Even questioned me.

689
00:34:27,997 --> 00:34:29,965
I don't think
there's any doubt about it.

690
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:31,967
He should be placed
in a mental institution.

691
00:34:32,001 --> 00:34:34,993
PIERCE: I don't agree.
People are institutionalized...

692
00:34:35,037 --> 00:34:37,174
to prevent them from
harming themselves or others.

693
00:34:37,307 --> 00:34:39,172
Mr. Kringle
is incapable of either.

694
00:34:39,209 --> 00:34:40,676
His is a delusion for good.

695
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,644
He only wants
to be friendly and helpful.

696
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,544
SHELLHAMMER:
That's what I feel, too.

697
00:34:44,581 --> 00:34:46,674
PIERCE: Thousands of people
have similar delusions...

698
00:34:46,716 --> 00:34:48,650
living perfectly normal lives
in every other respect.

699
00:34:48,685 --> 00:34:51,552
A famous example
is that fellow...

700
00:34:51,588 --> 00:34:54,056
I can't think of his name.

701
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,490
For years, he's insisted
he's a Russian prince.

702
00:34:56,526 --> 00:34:58,551
There's been much evidence
to prove him wrong...

703
00:34:58,595 --> 00:35:00,495
but nothing
has shaken his story.

704
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,997
Is he in an institution?

705
00:35:02,032 --> 00:35:04,330
No. He owns a famous restaurant
in Hollywood...

706
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:05,629
and is a highly
respected citizen.

707
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:08,934
SAWYER: I've made a great study
of abnormal psychology...

708
00:35:08,972 --> 00:35:12,305
and I've found from experience
when a delusion is challenged...

709
00:35:12,342 --> 00:35:13,934
the deluded
is apt to become violent.

710
00:35:13,977 --> 00:35:15,945
PIERCE: I'll have to disagree
with you again.

711
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:18,777
If you tell Kris
there is no Santa Claus...

712
00:35:18,815 --> 00:35:21,249
I grant he'll argue the point,
but he'll not become violent.

713
00:35:21,284 --> 00:35:23,479
His whole manner
suggests aggressiveness!

714
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,387
Look how he carries that cane!
He's never without it.

715
00:35:26,423 --> 00:35:28,823
I know Kris
always carries a cane...

716
00:35:28,858 --> 00:35:31,326
but surely you're not implying
he'd use the cane as a weapon?

717
00:35:31,361 --> 00:35:35,457
SAWYER: Mrs. Walker, naturally
I can't discharge this man.

718
00:35:35,498 --> 00:35:39,025
That's up to you.
But you asked my opinion.

719
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:40,969
So when he exhibits his latent
maniacal tendencies...

720
00:35:41,004 --> 00:35:42,938
which I assure you he will...

721
00:35:42,973 --> 00:35:45,601
please realize
the responsibility is yours.

722
00:35:51,081 --> 00:35:53,311
Speaking of delusions...

723
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,682
Now we're right back
where we started.

724
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,186
No, we're not.

725
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,654
After listening to Dr. Pierce,
I feel perfectly confident.

726
00:35:59,689 --> 00:36:02,715
But if anything happens,
you won't get blamed. I will.

727
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:05,353
PIERCE:
Nothing's going to happen.

728
00:36:05,395 --> 00:36:07,989
Please don't feel what I've said
was prompted by affection.

729
00:36:08,031 --> 00:36:09,999
My specialty is geriatrics.

730
00:36:10,033 --> 00:36:11,330
Huh?

731
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:12,926
PIERCE: Treatment
of the diseases of old age.

732
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:14,994
I've had quite a bit
of experience...

733
00:36:15,038 --> 00:36:19,202
and I assure you Kris has
no latent maniacal tendencies.

734
00:36:19,242 --> 00:36:20,937
You'll want to discuss this
with Mr. Shellhammer...

735
00:36:20,977 --> 00:36:23,537
so I'll be on my way.
May I see Kris?

736
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,047
DORIS: Why, certainly, Doctor.

737
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:26,946
Use the employees' elevator.
It's much quicker.

738
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:28,450
SHELLHAMMER:
The same one you came up on.

739
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:30,851
- Where is that?
- I'll show you.

740
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:32,684
PIERCE: That isn't necessary.
I'll find my way.

741
00:36:32,722 --> 00:36:35,213
DORIS: You understand
my position, Doctor.

742
00:36:35,258 --> 00:36:36,782
If there's the slightest
possibility...

743
00:36:36,826 --> 00:36:39,351
of him becoming violent
or getting into trouble...

744
00:36:39,396 --> 00:36:41,330
SHELLHAMMER:
What trouble could he get into?

745
00:36:41,364 --> 00:36:44,094
DORIS: All that's got to happen
is a policeman to ask his name.

746
00:36:44,134 --> 00:36:46,967
A big argument.
Clang, clang! Bellevue!

747
00:36:47,003 --> 00:36:48,971
PIERCE: You can prevent that
very simply.

748
00:36:49,005 --> 00:36:51,064
If he could
stay with an employee...

749
00:36:51,107 --> 00:36:53,302
they could ride
to and from work together.

750
00:36:53,343 --> 00:36:56,471
I'd prefer he didn't take the
train to Great Neck twice a day.

751
00:36:56,513 --> 00:36:57,980
SHELLHAMMER:
That would solve everything.

752
00:36:58,014 --> 00:37:00,073
They could steer him away
from trouble.

753
00:37:00,116 --> 00:37:01,583
DORIS:
Sort of take custody of him.

754
00:37:01,618 --> 00:37:03,245
Do you think
he'd agree to that?

755
00:37:03,286 --> 00:37:04,913
PIERCE: I'll talk to him.
I'm sure he will.

756
00:37:04,954 --> 00:37:06,421
DORIS:
In that case, he can stay.

757
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:08,048
PIERCE: Good. Thank you.

758
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:10,924
DORIS: It's the seventh floor,
and thank you very much.

759
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,154
- Bye, Doctor.
- Bye.

760
00:37:13,697 --> 00:37:16,257
SHELLHAMMER: I'm sure
you made a wise decision.

761
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:19,097
Now, let's see...
who could rent him a room?

762
00:37:19,135 --> 00:37:20,261
DORIS: You.

763
00:37:20,303 --> 00:37:22,931
Your son's away at school.
What about his room?

764
00:37:22,972 --> 00:37:25,964
Well, I don't mind.
I'd be glad to.

765
00:37:26,009 --> 00:37:28,443
I'm positive Mrs. Shellhammer
wouldn't like it.

766
00:37:28,478 --> 00:37:30,070
She's a little...

767
00:37:30,113 --> 00:37:32,081
Say, I have an idea.

768
00:37:32,115 --> 00:37:34,049
We always have martinis
before dinner.

769
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:36,712
I'll make them
double-strength tonight.

770
00:37:36,753 --> 00:37:39,722
I'll bet after a couple of them,
she'll be more receptive.

771
00:37:39,756 --> 00:37:41,451
But Kris is through work
at 6:00.

772
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:43,220
What about
the in-between time?

773
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:44,954
Take him home to dinner.

774
00:37:44,994 --> 00:37:48,054
I'll call soon as my wife's
plastered... feeling gay.

775
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:49,463
DORIS: Oh, no.

776
00:37:49,499 --> 00:37:51,057
SHELLHAMMER: If I'm willing
to let my wife...

777
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:53,001
have a big headache
in the morning...

778
00:37:53,036 --> 00:37:54,901
you can have
a little headache tonight.

779
00:37:54,938 --> 00:37:56,633
DORIS: All right.

780
00:37:56,673 --> 00:37:59,005
SHELLHAMMER: Won't take an hour.
Everything will be OK.

781
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:02,569
KRIS: Good. Very good.

782
00:38:02,612 --> 00:38:06,207
What sort of games do you play
with the other children?

783
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:09,946
I don't play much with them.
They play silly games.

784
00:38:09,986 --> 00:38:11,214
They do?

785
00:38:11,254 --> 00:38:13,916
Like today. They were
in the basement playing zoo...

786
00:38:13,957 --> 00:38:16,084
and all of them were animals.

787
00:38:16,126 --> 00:38:19,425
When I came down, Homer...
he was the zookeeper...

788
00:38:19,462 --> 00:38:22,590
he said, "What animal are you?"

789
00:38:22,632 --> 00:38:25,829
I said,
"I'm not an animal, I'm a girl."

790
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:27,928
And he said,
"Only animals allowed."

791
00:38:27,971 --> 00:38:29,836
So I came upstairs.

792
00:38:29,873 --> 00:38:32,137
Why didn't you tell him
you were a lion or a bear?

793
00:38:32,175 --> 00:38:34,075
SUZIE: Because
I'm not a bear or a lion.

794
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:37,079
KRIS: But the other children
were only children...

795
00:38:37,113 --> 00:38:39,081
and they were pretending
to be animals.

796
00:38:39,115 --> 00:38:41,447
SUZIE: That's what makes
the game so silly.

797
00:38:41,484 --> 00:38:42,644
KRIS: I don't think so.

798
00:38:42,685 --> 00:38:45,119
Sounds like
a wonderful game to me.

799
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:50,650
Of course, in order to play it,
you need an imagination.

800
00:38:50,693 --> 00:38:53,184
Do you know
what the imagination is?

801
00:38:53,229 --> 00:38:54,491
Oh, sure.

802
00:38:54,531 --> 00:38:57,193
That's when you see things,
but they're not really there.

803
00:38:57,233 --> 00:39:00,828
That can be caused
by other things, too.

804
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:04,431
No, to me the imagination
is a place all by itself...

805
00:39:04,474 --> 00:39:06,442
a separate country.

806
00:39:06,476 --> 00:39:09,604
You've heard of the French
or the British nation.

807
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:11,614
Well, this is
the Imagine nation.

808
00:39:11,648 --> 00:39:13,707
It's a wonderful place.

809
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:20,053
How would you like to make
snowballs in the summertime?

810
00:39:20,089 --> 00:39:24,219
Or drive a big bus
right down 5th Avenue?

811
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,820
How would you like to have
a ship all to yourself...

812
00:39:26,863 --> 00:39:30,822
that makes daily trips
to China and Australia?

813
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:33,427
How would you like to be
the Statue of Liberty...

814
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,802
in the morning,
and in the afternoon...

815
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,670
fly south with a flock of geese?

816
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:43,444
It's very simple.
Of course, it takes practice.

817
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,940
The first thing you've got
to learn is how to pretend.

818
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:51,943
And the next time Homer says,
"What kind of animal are you?"

819
00:39:51,988 --> 00:39:53,956
Tell him you're a monkey.

820
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,958
I don't know how to be a monkey.

821
00:39:55,992 --> 00:39:58,460
Sure you do.
Here, I'll show you.

822
00:39:58,495 --> 00:40:00,463
Now just bend
your body over a little.

823
00:40:00,497 --> 00:40:02,465
Let your arms hang loose, see?

824
00:40:02,499 --> 00:40:05,059
Now put your right hand
up here... under here.

825
00:40:05,101 --> 00:40:08,559
Now scratch yourself, see?
That's right.

826
00:40:08,605 --> 00:40:11,574
Put your tongue under your lips,
over your teeth.

827
00:40:11,608 --> 00:40:14,577
- Like this?
- That's right.

828
00:40:14,611 --> 00:40:16,476
Now scratch yourself
and chatter, see?

829
00:40:16,513 --> 00:40:19,710
- Bla bla bla!
- Eeek!

830
00:40:19,749 --> 00:40:21,114
Eeek erp!

831
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:24,483
Haislip, Haislip, Sherman,
Mackenzie, and Haislip...

832
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:25,988
have been very kind to me.

833
00:40:26,022 --> 00:40:29,583
But being an exceptional lawyer,
I want to open my own office.

834
00:40:29,626 --> 00:40:32,117
DORIS: Put this in
Susan's place for me, please.

835
00:40:32,161 --> 00:40:34,425
GAILEY: Take the meat out.
It should be done.

836
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:38,497
KRIS: Don't forget to scratch.

837
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:41,003
Put your tongue up
in front of your teeth.

838
00:40:41,037 --> 00:40:43,471
Talk to the other monkeys.

839
00:40:43,506 --> 00:40:45,804
GAILEY: What's going on here?

840
00:40:45,842 --> 00:40:47,969
KRIS: We're having
our first lesson in pretending.

841
00:40:48,011 --> 00:40:50,002
Doing quite well at it, too.

842
00:40:50,046 --> 00:40:53,015
That's right.
Call the other monkeys.

843
00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:57,509
No. You mustn't be a goose.
Be a monkey.

844
00:40:57,554 --> 00:41:00,318
- Mr. Kringle...
- Yes?

845
00:41:00,356 --> 00:41:02,381
Mrs. Walker
just happened to mention...

846
00:41:02,425 --> 00:41:04,620
that they're looking
for a room for you.

847
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:05,958
KRIS: That's right.

848
00:41:05,995 --> 00:41:08,589
Dr. Pierce doesn't want me
making the long trip daily.

849
00:41:08,631 --> 00:41:10,462
GAILEY: I was just thinking.

850
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,492
I'm all alone in my apartment.

851
00:41:13,536 --> 00:41:15,970
Twin beds, plenty of room.

852
00:41:16,005 --> 00:41:18,974
If you'd like
to move in with me...

853
00:41:19,008 --> 00:41:20,976
I'd be only too happy
to have you.

854
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:22,637
KRIS:
That's awfully nice of you.

855
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:25,580
You could ride to and from
work with Mrs. Walker.

856
00:41:25,615 --> 00:41:28,812
Yes. That would
give me a chance...

857
00:41:28,851 --> 00:41:31,388
to really talk things
over with her.

858
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:33,819
[Suzie chattering]

859
00:41:33,857 --> 00:41:37,884
KRIS: Don't forget to scratch.
You're not scratching.

860
00:41:37,927 --> 00:41:40,657
Besides, I could see
Suzie now and then.

861
00:41:40,697 --> 00:41:42,494
Mr. Gailey, it's a deal.

862
00:41:42,532 --> 00:41:43,965
- Good!
- [Telephone rings]

863
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,299
We'll get your things
after dinner.

864
00:41:47,337 --> 00:41:49,567
Hello.
Oh, yes, just a moment.

865
00:41:49,606 --> 00:41:51,096
It's a Mr. Shellhammer.

866
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:52,301
DORIS: Thanks.

867
00:41:53,376 --> 00:41:55,139
Hello, Mr. Shellhammer.

868
00:41:55,178 --> 00:41:57,305
Yes. Just a moment.

869
00:41:57,347 --> 00:41:59,542
Mrs. Shellhammer
wants to talk to you.

870
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:03,444
I made the martinis
triple-strength...

871
00:42:03,486 --> 00:42:05,477
and she feels wonderful.

872
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,451
Here, my pet.

873
00:42:08,491 --> 00:42:10,254
MRS. SHELLHAMMER: Ha ha.

874
00:42:10,293 --> 00:42:11,783
Hello?

875
00:42:13,296 --> 00:42:14,763
Hello?

876
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,766
SHELLHAMMER: No, no. No, dear.

877
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,098
MRS. SHELLHAMMER:
Thank you, darling.

878
00:42:19,135 --> 00:42:20,898
[Giggles]

879
00:42:20,937 --> 00:42:22,802
Hello?

880
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:25,637
SHELLHAMMER:
No, no, dear. There.

881
00:42:25,675 --> 00:42:28,838
MRS. SHELLHAMMER:
Oh, darling, how silly of me!

882
00:42:30,513 --> 00:42:32,140
Hello!

883
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:38,445
We'd love to have Santa Claus
come and stay with us.

884
00:42:38,488 --> 00:42:40,319
[Giggles]

885
00:42:40,356 --> 00:42:43,553
I think it would be
simply charming.

886
00:42:43,593 --> 00:42:45,993
Oh, and so do I,
Mrs. Shellhammer.

887
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:47,997
Just a moment.

888
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:51,000
It's Mrs. Shellhammer.
They have the loveliest room.

889
00:42:51,034 --> 00:42:53,093
They'd be so happy
if you'd stay with them.

890
00:42:53,136 --> 00:42:55,104
That's very sweet of them.

891
00:42:55,138 --> 00:42:56,469
Please thank them very much...

892
00:42:56,506 --> 00:42:59,964
but I'm going to stay
with Mr. Gailey.

893
00:43:00,009 --> 00:43:01,135
DORIS: Mr. Gailey.

894
00:43:01,177 --> 00:43:03,873
I think
I'd better get the meat.

895
00:43:06,649 --> 00:43:08,276
KRIS: Yes, I understand that...

896
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:10,445
but there must be something
you want for Christmas...

897
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,955
something you haven't
even told your mother.

898
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:15,253
Oh, come on, now.

899
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:17,316
Why don't you give me a chance?

900
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:20,853
Well...

901
00:43:37,614 --> 00:43:39,844
SUZIE: That's what
I want for Christmas.

902
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:41,510
KRIS:
A doll's house like this?

903
00:43:41,551 --> 00:43:44,145
No, a real house.

904
00:43:44,187 --> 00:43:46,348
If you're really Santa Claus,
you can get it for me.

905
00:43:46,389 --> 00:43:47,617
And if you can't...

906
00:43:47,657 --> 00:43:50,353
you're only a nice man with
a white beard, like mother said.

907
00:43:50,393 --> 00:43:51,985
Now wait a minute, Suzie.

908
00:43:52,028 --> 00:43:54,326
Just because every child
can't get his wish...

909
00:43:54,364 --> 00:43:55,831
doesn't mean
there isn't a Santa Claus.

910
00:43:55,865 --> 00:43:58,197
That's what I thought you'd say.

911
00:43:58,234 --> 00:43:59,997
But don't you see, dear?

912
00:44:00,036 --> 00:44:02,937
Some children wish for things
they couldn't possibly use...

913
00:44:02,972 --> 00:44:05,668
like real locomotives
or B-29s.

914
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:09,269
But this isn't like
a locomotive or a B-29.

915
00:44:09,312 --> 00:44:11,872
It's awful big
for a little girl like you.

916
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,611
What could you do
with a house like this?

917
00:44:14,651 --> 00:44:16,482
SUZIE:
Live in it with my mother.

918
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:18,783
KRIS: But you've got
this lovely apartment.

919
00:44:18,821 --> 00:44:20,448
I don't think it's lovely.

920
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:24,893
I want a backyard with a great
big tree to put a swing on...

921
00:44:28,498 --> 00:44:30,363
I guess you can't get it, huh?

922
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,834
I didn't say that.

923
00:44:32,869 --> 00:44:34,359
Well...

924
00:44:39,008 --> 00:44:41,977
Well, it's a tall order...

925
00:44:42,011 --> 00:44:43,979
but I'll do my best.

926
00:44:44,013 --> 00:44:45,640
May I keep this picture?

927
00:44:45,682 --> 00:44:47,377
Mm-hmm.

928
00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:50,875
Thank you. Good night, Susan.

929
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,911
SUZIE: Good night, Mr. Kringle.

930
00:45:40,503 --> 00:45:42,471
KRIS:
Nice place you've got here.

931
00:45:42,505 --> 00:45:44,473
GAILEY: Was I lucky to get it!

932
00:45:44,507 --> 00:45:47,908
KRIS: You like living
in Manhattan?

933
00:45:47,944 --> 00:45:49,912
GAILEY: It's all right.

934
00:45:49,946 --> 00:45:52,278
Someday I'd like to get
a place on Long Island.

935
00:45:52,315 --> 00:45:53,646
Not a big house.

936
00:45:53,683 --> 00:45:56,914
One of those junior-partner
deals around Manhasset.

937
00:45:56,953 --> 00:46:00,480
KRIS: I know just
the kind of place you mean.

938
00:46:00,523 --> 00:46:03,856
One of those
little Colonial houses.

939
00:46:03,893 --> 00:46:06,361
GAILEY: Either that or Cape Cod.

940
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:08,864
KRIS:
You're right about Mrs. Walker.

941
00:46:08,898 --> 00:46:10,889
A little more effort
on your part...

942
00:46:10,933 --> 00:46:13,902
and she might crawl out
of that shell.

943
00:46:13,936 --> 00:46:15,927
Take her to dinner, the theater.

944
00:46:15,972 --> 00:46:17,599
GAILEY: I've tried that.

945
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,904
She's always too busy
with her job.

946
00:46:19,942 --> 00:46:22,570
KRIS: Try a little harder.
Those two are lost souls.

947
00:46:22,612 --> 00:46:24,443
It's up to us to help them.

948
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,449
I'll take care of Suzie
if you take care of her mother.

949
00:46:27,483 --> 00:46:29,451
- It's a deal.
- Ready?

950
00:46:29,485 --> 00:46:31,953
Oh, no, you don't.
I'm not gonna be cheated.

951
00:46:31,988 --> 00:46:34,081
All my life
I've wondered something.

952
00:46:34,123 --> 00:46:36,091
Now's my chance to find out.

953
00:46:36,125 --> 00:46:38,593
It's a question that's puzzled
the world for centuries.

954
00:46:38,628 --> 00:46:43,429
Does Santa Claus sleep
with his whiskers outside or in?

955
00:46:43,466 --> 00:46:45,434
KRIS:
Always sleep with them out.

956
00:46:45,468 --> 00:46:47,459
Cold air makes them grow.

957
00:46:53,843 --> 00:46:55,470
MAN: Joe, we're running
out of books.

958
00:46:55,511 --> 00:46:57,103
JOE: I'll get some right away.

959
00:46:57,146 --> 00:46:58,977
WOMAN:
I need some more Wanamakers.

960
00:47:22,972 --> 00:47:25,440
SALESMAN:
Yes, I know just what you want.

961
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:28,444
We don't carry that brand,
but I think Gimbels does.

962
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:31,936
Let me see. Yes, here it is.

963
00:47:31,981 --> 00:47:34,575
I thought I noticed it before.
2.98.

964
00:47:34,617 --> 00:47:36,448
Looks like
an exceptional bargain.

965
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:38,454
WOMAN: Yes, it does. Thank you.

966
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:40,319
SALESMAN: Not at all.

967
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:50,958
Why didn't one of you
think of this idea?

968
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,401
It's the greatest
goodwill policy I ever heard of.

969
00:47:54,437 --> 00:47:56,371
Every shopper
in New York City...

970
00:47:56,405 --> 00:47:59,499
suddenly thinks of Macy
as a benevolent soul...

971
00:47:59,542 --> 00:48:02,534
thinking only of the welfare
of the public.

972
00:48:02,578 --> 00:48:04,409
And what does that make Gimbel?

973
00:48:04,447 --> 00:48:06,415
Nothing but a profiteering
moneygrubber.

974
00:48:06,449 --> 00:48:08,417
Two can play at this game.

975
00:48:08,451 --> 00:48:11,420
From now on, if we haven't got
what the customer wants...

976
00:48:11,454 --> 00:48:12,921
send him back to Macy's.

977
00:48:12,955 --> 00:48:15,389
And what's more, we'll do
the same thing in our stores...

978
00:48:15,424 --> 00:48:18,052
in Philadelphia,
Milwaukee, and Pittsburgh.

979
00:48:18,094 --> 00:48:20,062
Get to work on it right away.

980
00:48:22,031 --> 00:48:24,693
MACY: So, Gimbel's doing it
in Philadelphia...

981
00:48:24,734 --> 00:48:26,429
Pittsburgh, and Milwaukee, eh?

982
00:48:26,469 --> 00:48:27,936
MAN: And very successfully.

983
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,029
MACY: Well, we can cover
the country, too.

984
00:48:30,072 --> 00:48:32,063
Notify our stores
in San Francisco...

985
00:48:32,108 --> 00:48:35,566
Atlanta, Toledo, and Newark
to get going right away.

986
00:48:35,611 --> 00:48:37,078
MEN: All right, Mr. Macy.

987
00:48:38,247 --> 00:48:41,375
- Look this way, Mr. Gimbel.
- Hold it, Mr. Gimbel.

988
00:48:41,417 --> 00:48:43,146
One more.

989
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:44,983
That's fine.

990
00:48:45,021 --> 00:48:47,421
GIMBEL: Now we'll take some
at my store.

991
00:48:47,456 --> 00:48:48,889
MACY: Just a minute.

992
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:52,383
I have something I'd like
to give our friend here.

993
00:48:52,428 --> 00:48:56,364
This is a little something
to show my appreciation...

994
00:48:56,399 --> 00:48:57,525
for all you've done.

995
00:48:57,567 --> 00:48:59,797
KRIS: Thank you, Mr. Macy.

996
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:02,737
Ooh! That's very kind of you.

997
00:49:02,772 --> 00:49:05,900
I didn't think
you were that generous.

998
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:07,910
That's a bit of money.

999
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:09,912
What are you going
to do with it?

1000
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:13,575
Well, I have a friend.

1001
00:49:13,616 --> 00:49:16,414
A doctor.
He's been very kind to me.

1002
00:49:16,452 --> 00:49:18,420
He needs an x-ray machine.

1003
00:49:18,454 --> 00:49:20,855
MACY: I don't think
that's going to be enough.

1004
00:49:20,988 --> 00:49:23,616
GIMBEL:
I'll make up the difference.

1005
00:49:23,657 --> 00:49:25,625
MACY: Buy it through the store.
Get 10% discount.

1006
00:49:25,659 --> 00:49:28,059
I can get it for cost.

1007
00:49:34,335 --> 00:49:36,030
CLEO: Good night, Susan.

1008
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:37,799
SUZIE: Good night, Cleo.

1009
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:41,296
KRIS: Like me to sing you
a good night song?

1010
00:49:41,342 --> 00:49:43,310
SUZIE: If you want to.

1011
00:49:43,344 --> 00:49:46,313
KRIS: Doesn't your mother
ever sing to you at night?

1012
00:49:46,347 --> 00:49:49,077
SUZIE: Uh-uh. Why should she?

1013
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:53,951
Oh, no reason.
I just think it's kind of nice.

1014
00:49:53,988 --> 00:49:57,287
- Do you like "Market"?
- All right.

1015
00:49:57,324 --> 00:50:01,351
[Singing] To market, to market
to buy a fat pig

1016
00:50:01,395 --> 00:50:04,626
Home again, home again,
jiggidy jig

1017
00:50:04,665 --> 00:50:08,066
To market, to market
to buy a fat hog

1018
00:50:08,102 --> 00:50:11,970
Home again, home again,
jiggidy...

1019
00:50:16,644 --> 00:50:19,044
Amazing.

1020
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:21,240
Do you happen
to have a spare piece?

1021
00:50:21,282 --> 00:50:22,579
SUZIE: Mm-hmm.

1022
00:50:32,593 --> 00:50:34,424
Well, here goes.

1023
00:50:41,568 --> 00:50:42,728
[Loud pop]

1024
00:50:45,673 --> 00:50:48,301
Oh!

1025
00:51:03,924 --> 00:51:05,755
- Hello, Alfred.
- Hello, Kris.

1026
00:51:05,793 --> 00:51:08,591
KRIS: How about a game
of checkers after lunch?

1027
00:51:08,629 --> 00:51:11,757
ALFRED: Leave us not today.
I don't feel like it.

1028
00:51:11,799 --> 00:51:13,596
KRIS: Oh? What's the matter?

1029
00:51:13,634 --> 00:51:15,363
ALFRED: Nothing. Nothing.

1030
00:51:15,403 --> 00:51:18,065
KRIS: Something is wrong.
What is it?

1031
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,473
ALFRED: Well,
remember I was telling you...

1032
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:25,809
how I like to play Santa
at the "Y" on Christmas...

1033
00:51:25,846 --> 00:51:28,144
and give out packages
to the young kids?

1034
00:51:28,182 --> 00:51:30,650
I was telling that
to Mr. Sawyer, see...

1035
00:51:30,685 --> 00:51:33,552
and he says that's very bad.

1036
00:51:33,587 --> 00:51:35,282
KRIS: Sawyer. You mean, uh...

1037
00:51:35,323 --> 00:51:38,292
ALFRED: That's the one.
He's a psychologist.

1038
00:51:38,326 --> 00:51:41,295
KRIS: Ohh,
that's a debatable poin...

1039
00:51:41,329 --> 00:51:43,194
Why is it bad, does he say?

1040
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:47,792
ALFRED: He says guys who dress
like Santa Claus, see...

1041
00:51:47,835 --> 00:51:49,302
and give presents away...

1042
00:51:49,337 --> 00:51:51,305
do it because
when they was young...

1043
00:51:51,339 --> 00:51:52,806
they must have
did something bad...

1044
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,239
and they feel guilty about it.

1045
00:51:54,275 --> 00:51:56,402
So now they do something
they think is good...

1046
00:51:56,444 --> 00:51:57,741
to make up for it.

1047
00:51:57,778 --> 00:52:00,542
It's what he calls
a guilt complex.

1048
00:52:02,783 --> 00:52:04,546
KRIS: How old are you, Alfred?

1049
00:52:04,585 --> 00:52:06,052
ALFRED: Seventeen.

1050
00:52:06,087 --> 00:52:08,248
KRIS: Seventeen.

1051
00:52:08,289 --> 00:52:10,917
Doesn't seem you've had time
to be guilty of anything...

1052
00:52:10,958 --> 00:52:12,482
except overeating.

1053
00:52:12,526 --> 00:52:14,756
It's nothing to laugh about.

1054
00:52:14,795 --> 00:52:16,888
It's pretty serious, he says.

1055
00:52:16,931 --> 00:52:19,229
It's a lot of rubbish, Alfred.
Don't listen.

1056
00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:21,257
Oh, he knows
what he's talking about.

1057
00:52:21,302 --> 00:52:24,100
He's been studying that stuff
for a long time.

1058
00:52:24,138 --> 00:52:27,767
KRIS: Well, what's the basis
of this guilt complex...

1059
00:52:27,808 --> 00:52:29,435
you're supposed to have?

1060
00:52:29,477 --> 00:52:31,001
Does he say that?

1061
00:52:31,045 --> 00:52:34,276
Well, he ain't found out yet.

1062
00:52:34,315 --> 00:52:37,773
It's probably way down
inside of me someplace, see?

1063
00:52:37,818 --> 00:52:41,015
Maybe something that happened
when I was a baby, he says.

1064
00:52:41,055 --> 00:52:44,149
It takes time,
but he'll do it, he says.

1065
00:52:44,191 --> 00:52:47,024
KRIS: You mean
you're going to him again?

1066
00:52:47,061 --> 00:52:50,121
ALFRED: Sure.
I go every day after lunch.

1067
00:52:50,164 --> 00:52:52,530
Oh, he don't soak me nothin'.

1068
00:52:52,566 --> 00:52:56,229
He's doing it for free
'cause I'm an interesting case.

1069
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:57,464
KRIS: Yes.

1070
00:52:57,505 --> 00:53:00,372
What else has he found
wrong with you, Alfred?

1071
00:53:01,442 --> 00:53:03,342
Anything else?

1072
00:53:03,377 --> 00:53:06,437
No. Oh, just
that I hate my father.

1073
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,449
I didn't know it,
but he says I do.

1074
00:53:09,483 --> 00:53:11,849
And he sees you every day?

1075
00:53:11,886 --> 00:53:15,344
Yeah. I say anything
that comes into my head.

1076
00:53:15,389 --> 00:53:17,254
Excuse me, Alfred.

1077
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:18,952
A few things
have just come into my head...

1078
00:53:18,993 --> 00:53:20,517
and I'm going to say them.

1079
00:53:32,072 --> 00:53:33,869
SAWYER:
Why are you busting in here?

1080
00:53:33,908 --> 00:53:35,967
KRIS:
Are you a licensed psychiatrist?

1081
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:38,205
SAWYER:
What business is it of yours?

1082
00:53:38,245 --> 00:53:40,270
KRIS: I have great respect
for psychiatry...

1083
00:53:40,314 --> 00:53:43,306
and great contempt for amateurs
who go around practicing it.

1084
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:45,284
You have no more right
to analyze Alfred...

1085
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:47,617
than a dentist has
to remove a gallbladder!

1086
00:53:47,655 --> 00:53:48,952
SAWYER: I beg your pardon.

1087
00:53:48,989 --> 00:53:52,254
KRIS: Your job here, I gather,
is to give intelligence tests.

1088
00:53:52,293 --> 00:53:54,158
Passing yourself off
as a psychologist.

1089
00:53:54,195 --> 00:53:56,425
You ought to be horsewhipped...

1090
00:53:56,464 --> 00:53:58,728
taking a normal, impressionable
boy like Alfred...

1091
00:53:58,766 --> 00:54:00,529
and filling him with complexes.

1092
00:54:00,568 --> 00:54:02,900
SAWYER: I'm better equipped
to judge that than you are.

1093
00:54:02,937 --> 00:54:05,235
KRIS: Just because the boy
wants to be kind to children...

1094
00:54:05,272 --> 00:54:07,240
you tell him
he has a guilt complex.

1095
00:54:07,274 --> 00:54:09,003
SAWYER: Sharing his delusion,
you couldn't understand.

1096
00:54:09,043 --> 00:54:11,409
Alfred's definitely maladjusted,
and I'm helping.

1097
00:54:11,445 --> 00:54:12,912
KRIS: Maladjusted?!
You talk about maladjusted.

1098
00:54:12,947 --> 00:54:15,245
It seems to me the patient
is running the clinic here.

1099
00:54:15,282 --> 00:54:17,750
SAWYER: I won't stand...
Leave this office immediately.

1100
00:54:17,785 --> 00:54:19,946
KRIS: Now either
you stop analyzing Alfred...

1101
00:54:19,987 --> 00:54:21,454
or I go straight to Mr. Macy...

1102
00:54:21,489 --> 00:54:23,753
and tell him what a contemptible
fraud you are.

1103
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:25,452
SAWYER:
Leave or I'll call security.

1104
00:54:25,493 --> 00:54:29,395
KRIS: There's only one way
to handle a man like you.

1105
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:31,830
You won't listen to reason.
You're heartless.

1106
00:54:31,866 --> 00:54:32,992
You have no humanity.

1107
00:54:33,033 --> 00:54:35,228
SAWYER: Are you going to leave?

1108
00:54:35,269 --> 00:54:36,463
KRIS: Yes.

1109
00:54:45,646 --> 00:54:46,943
- Kris.
- Mr. Sawyer!

1110
00:54:46,981 --> 00:54:49,449
DORIS: Mr. Sawyer,
are you all right?

1111
00:54:49,483 --> 00:54:50,677
SHELLHAMMER: Look at that bump!

1112
00:54:50,718 --> 00:54:51,946
Mr. Sawyer...
He's unconscious!

1113
00:54:51,986 --> 00:54:53,886
Better get a wet towel.

1114
00:54:53,921 --> 00:54:55,388
DORIS: No, better get a doctor.

1115
00:54:55,422 --> 00:54:57,890
DORIS: You must have done
something to him.

1116
00:54:57,925 --> 00:54:59,893
I tell you
we were merely talking...

1117
00:54:59,927 --> 00:55:03,124
but when I mentioned Santa Claus
and attacked his delusion...

1118
00:55:03,163 --> 00:55:04,391
he became violent.

1119
00:55:04,431 --> 00:55:06,899
I told you he had
latent maniacal tendencies.

1120
00:55:06,934 --> 00:55:08,902
Well, I think this proves it.

1121
00:55:08,936 --> 00:55:11,404
SHELLHAMMER: Have Dr. Pierce
give him another examination.

1122
00:55:11,438 --> 00:55:12,564
SAWYER: Dr. Pierce...

1123
00:55:12,606 --> 00:55:14,904
He doesn't know anything
about this sort of thing.

1124
00:55:14,942 --> 00:55:16,409
He's a general practitioner.

1125
00:55:16,443 --> 00:55:18,411
SHELLHAMMER: You must admit
this is rather serious.

1126
00:55:18,445 --> 00:55:19,912
Perhaps we'd better get
a competent psychiatrist.

1127
00:55:19,947 --> 00:55:22,415
DORIS: But he's taken dozens
of those examinations...

1128
00:55:22,449 --> 00:55:23,916
and passed them all 100%.

1129
00:55:23,951 --> 00:55:26,647
SAWYER: It's possible
his condition has changed.

1130
00:55:26,687 --> 00:55:28,917
SHELLHAMMER: I don't think
we can take any chances.

1131
00:55:28,956 --> 00:55:30,924
I can't see any harm in it.

1132
00:55:30,958 --> 00:55:33,483
If he passes the test,
he can return to work at once...

1133
00:55:33,527 --> 00:55:35,927
and if he doesn't,
it's better if we find out.

1134
00:55:35,963 --> 00:55:38,431
SAWYER: You better have
the examination right away...

1135
00:55:38,465 --> 00:55:41,434
before he tells Mr. Ma...
before Mr. Macy finds out.

1136
00:55:41,468 --> 00:55:42,594
SHELLHAMMER: Oh, my, yes.

1137
00:55:42,636 --> 00:55:45,434
You explain to Mr. Kringle.
After all, you're his friend.

1138
00:55:45,472 --> 00:55:48,100
DORIS: I won't do it.
I've grown very fond of him.

1139
00:55:48,142 --> 00:55:51,441
This would be like telling him
I thought he was insane.

1140
00:55:51,478 --> 00:55:53,878
SAWYER: You don't call this
acting normal, do you?

1141
00:55:53,914 --> 00:55:55,438
DORIS: Of course I don't...

1142
00:55:55,482 --> 00:55:57,882
but there are thousands
of elderly who aren't normal.

1143
00:55:57,918 --> 00:56:00,944
This will hurt Kris deeply,
and I don't want to do it!

1144
00:56:08,762 --> 00:56:10,730
SHELLHAMMER:
That wouldn't be fair to him.

1145
00:56:10,764 --> 00:56:12,231
I'll tell him the truth.

1146
00:56:12,266 --> 00:56:14,393
I believe in being truthful
with people.

1147
00:56:14,435 --> 00:56:16,733
SAWYER: If he sees me
or you mention psychiatrist...

1148
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:19,398
it's more or less attacking
his delusion again.

1149
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,907
He's apt to become violent.

1150
00:56:20,941 --> 00:56:22,408
SHELLHAMMER:
But in front of the children?

1151
00:56:22,443 --> 00:56:23,910
Oh, that would be terrible.

1152
00:56:23,944 --> 00:56:26,742
SAWYER: Get him out of the store
on some other pretext.

1153
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,907
Then once outside,
I'll explain it to him.

1154
00:56:28,949 --> 00:56:30,940
SHELLHAMMER: If you think
it's better that way.

1155
00:56:32,486 --> 00:56:35,387
CLERK: Keep a straight line.
All day long to see Santa Claus.

1156
00:56:37,958 --> 00:56:39,255
Oh!

1157
00:56:41,962 --> 00:56:43,259
- Mr. Kringle.
- Yes?

1158
00:56:43,297 --> 00:56:44,924
SHELLHAMMER: Mrs. Walker
wanted you to know...

1159
00:56:44,965 --> 00:56:46,933
that we're going to take
some publicity pictures...

1160
00:56:46,967 --> 00:56:49,765
this afternoon
down at the city hall...

1161
00:56:49,803 --> 00:56:50,929
you and the mayor.

1162
00:56:50,971 --> 00:56:52,438
KRIS: Good. Like to meet him.

1163
00:56:52,473 --> 00:56:54,873
A few things
I'd like to discuss with him.

1164
00:56:54,908 --> 00:56:58,366
Oh, but I made an appointment
with Mr. Macy at 4:00.

1165
00:56:58,412 --> 00:57:00,380
I want to tell him
about something.

1166
00:57:00,414 --> 00:57:02,882
SHELLHAMMER: You'll be back
in plenty of time.

1167
00:57:02,916 --> 00:57:04,383
There's a car waiting
downstairs.

1168
00:57:04,418 --> 00:57:06,352
It's starting to drizzle.
You'll need a coat.

1169
00:57:06,387 --> 00:57:07,513
I'll get it.

1170
00:57:07,554 --> 00:57:08,987
KRIS: Thanks. Be right with you.

1171
00:57:09,023 --> 00:57:11,890
I just want to take care
of a few kiddies first.

1172
00:57:11,925 --> 00:57:13,415
SHELLHAMMER: All right.

1173
00:57:36,717 --> 00:57:38,207
CABBY: Where to?

1174
00:57:38,252 --> 00:57:39,719
SAWYER: Bellevue.

1175
00:57:39,753 --> 00:57:40,981
KRIS: Bellevue?!

1176
00:57:49,797 --> 00:57:51,498
Did she know about this?

1177
00:57:51,631 --> 00:57:54,464
SAWYER: Yes.
We all discussed it.

1178
00:58:03,376 --> 00:58:04,843
The second party shall...

1179
00:58:04,878 --> 00:58:06,846
in consideration
of the property...

1180
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,848
agree to be conveyed
by the first party to...

1181
00:58:08,882 --> 00:58:11,442
[Telephone ringing]
Excuse me, Gertrude. Telephone.

1182
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,354
Hello.

1183
00:58:15,388 --> 00:58:17,379
Yes. Yes.

1184
00:58:18,424 --> 00:58:20,824
Why, yes,
we share an apartment together.

1185
00:58:23,096 --> 00:58:24,222
Bellevue?

1186
00:58:24,264 --> 00:58:27,097
But why, Doctor? What did he...

1187
00:58:27,133 --> 00:58:29,067
Oh, he's quite comfortable.

1188
00:58:29,102 --> 00:58:32,071
He's going to be with us
for a few days...

1189
00:58:32,105 --> 00:58:35,074
and wondered if you could bring
his personal things.

1190
00:58:35,108 --> 00:58:38,566
Yes, in view
of his examination...

1191
00:58:38,611 --> 00:58:42,877
I'm afraid I shall have
to recommend commitment.

1192
00:58:42,916 --> 00:58:44,884
Yes, I know, Mr. Gailey...

1193
00:58:44,918 --> 00:58:46,783
but I'd rather speak to you
in person.

1194
00:58:46,819 --> 00:58:48,377
I'll be right over, Doctor.

1195
00:58:50,356 --> 00:58:51,516
[Buzz]

1196
00:58:55,361 --> 00:58:57,022
ATTENDANT:
To see the new patient.

1197
00:58:57,063 --> 00:58:58,724
- Thanks.
- Not at all.

1198
00:59:08,241 --> 00:59:09,902
GAILEY: Hello, Kris.

1199
00:59:09,943 --> 00:59:11,843
KRIS: Fred.

1200
00:59:11,878 --> 00:59:14,745
GAILEY: Why'd you do it, Kris?

1201
00:59:14,781 --> 00:59:17,773
You deliberately failed
that examination, didn't you?

1202
00:59:19,752 --> 00:59:21,083
Why?

1203
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:25,113
KRIS: Because the last few days
I've had great hope.

1204
00:59:25,158 --> 00:59:28,616
I had a feeling Doris was
beginning to believe in me.

1205
00:59:28,661 --> 00:59:32,119
And now I find out she was just
humoring me all the time.

1206
00:59:32,165 --> 00:59:33,632
GAILEY: I just telephoned her.

1207
00:59:33,666 --> 00:59:36,362
She didn't know anything about
taking pictures with the mayor.

1208
00:59:36,402 --> 00:59:38,370
That was Sawyer's idea.

1209
00:59:38,404 --> 00:59:40,065
KRIS: Well, I'm glad of that.

1210
00:59:40,106 --> 00:59:43,667
But why didn't she come to me
and explain the whole thing?

1211
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:46,144
GAILEY:
She didn't want to hurt you.

1212
00:59:46,179 --> 00:59:49,376
KRIS: Only because I was a nice,
kind old man she felt sorry for.

1213
00:59:49,415 --> 00:59:50,882
GAILEY: That's not true.

1214
00:59:50,917 --> 00:59:52,782
KRIS: Yes, it is.
She had doubts.

1215
00:59:52,819 --> 00:59:54,081
That's why she was just sorry.

1216
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,088
If you'd been dragged off here
instead of me...

1217
00:59:56,122 --> 00:59:57,680
she wouldn't have been sorry.

1218
00:59:57,724 --> 00:59:59,123
She'd have been furious.

1219
00:59:59,158 --> 01:00:02,184
GAILEY: All right,
she had doubts. Why not?

1220
01:00:02,228 --> 01:00:04,696
She hasn't really believed
in anything for years.

1221
01:00:04,731 --> 01:00:06,665
You can't expect her
to suddenly...

1222
01:00:06,699 --> 01:00:09,532
KRIS: Oh, it's not just Doris.
There's Mr. Sawyer.

1223
01:00:09,569 --> 01:00:14,529
He's contemptible, dishonest,
selfish, deceitful, vicious...

1224
01:00:14,574 --> 01:00:17,202
Yet he's out there
and I'm in here.

1225
01:00:17,243 --> 01:00:19,643
He's called normal and I'm not.

1226
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:21,704
Well, if that's normal,
I don't want it.

1227
01:00:21,748 --> 01:00:24,717
That's why
I answered incorrectly.

1228
01:00:24,751 --> 01:00:27,686
GAILEY: But, Kris, you can't
just think of yourself.

1229
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,814
What happens to you matters
to a lot of people.

1230
01:00:30,857 --> 01:00:34,384
People like me, who believe
in what you stand for...

1231
01:00:34,427 --> 01:00:37,726
and people like Suzie,
who are just beginning to.

1232
01:00:37,764 --> 01:00:40,892
You can't quit.
You can't let them down.

1233
01:00:40,933 --> 01:00:42,833
KRIS: No, I suppose I shouldn't.

1234
01:00:42,869 --> 01:00:45,702
GAILEY: Who knows, maybe someday
the Sawyers will be in here...

1235
01:00:45,738 --> 01:00:47,205
instead of out there.

1236
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,232
KRIS: You're right.
I ought to be ashamed of myself.

1237
01:00:50,276 --> 01:00:53,803
Even if we can't win,
we can go down swinging.

1238
01:00:53,846 --> 01:00:55,746
Let's get out of here.

1239
01:00:55,782 --> 01:00:57,249
GAILEY: Now, wait a minute.

1240
01:00:57,283 --> 01:01:00,309
You're forgetting you flunked
your examination but good.

1241
01:01:00,353 --> 01:01:02,321
KRIS: Oh, yes, I forgot.

1242
01:01:02,355 --> 01:01:04,721
I said Calvin Coolidge
was the first president.

1243
01:01:04,757 --> 01:01:08,215
I can imagine what they're
thinking of me for saying that.

1244
01:01:08,261 --> 01:01:10,229
But you'll get me out of this.

1245
01:01:10,263 --> 01:01:11,787
You'll think of something.

1246
01:01:11,831 --> 01:01:13,298
GAILEY:
It's not gonna be easy, Kris.

1247
01:01:13,332 --> 01:01:14,799
KRIS: It will be for you.

1248
01:01:14,834 --> 01:01:17,268
I believe you're the greatest
lawyer since Darrow.

1249
01:01:17,303 --> 01:01:19,794
GAILEY: Just a second, Kris.
You're putting me in a bad spot.

1250
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:22,899
KRIS: But I believe in you.
You can't let me down.

1251
01:01:22,942 --> 01:01:24,967
GAILEY:
But you don't understand. It...

1252
01:01:27,313 --> 01:01:29,907
I'll do everything I can, Kris.

1253
01:01:29,949 --> 01:01:31,075
KRIS: Thank you.

1254
01:01:31,117 --> 01:01:33,347
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

1255
01:01:37,857 --> 01:01:40,155
MACY: That's a lot of nonsense!
Dangerous, my foot!

1256
01:01:40,193 --> 01:01:42,320
I don't care
if he failed ten examinations.

1257
01:01:42,361 --> 01:01:43,828
You had no right to do it!

1258
01:01:43,863 --> 01:01:46,331
You get the case
dropped tomorrow...

1259
01:01:46,365 --> 01:01:50,301
or you might have another lump
to match the one Kris gave you!

1260
01:01:50,336 --> 01:01:51,735
SAWYER: Yes, Mr. Macy.

1261
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:08,243
HARPER: Age unknown.

1262
01:02:08,287 --> 01:02:09,720
Old man, huh?

1263
01:02:09,756 --> 01:02:11,724
MARRAH: Very old, Your Honor.

1264
01:02:11,758 --> 01:02:14,454
HARPER: I suppose
I'll have to read all this.

1265
01:02:14,494 --> 01:02:16,826
Take my word for it.
Just routine commitment papers.

1266
01:02:16,863 --> 01:02:18,330
Cut and dried.

1267
01:02:18,364 --> 01:02:20,229
The man calls himself
Kris Kringle...

1268
01:02:20,266 --> 01:02:21,995
thinks he's Santa Claus.

1269
01:02:22,034 --> 01:02:23,296
Uh-oh.

1270
01:02:24,804 --> 01:02:25,930
[Knock on door]

1271
01:02:25,972 --> 01:02:27,234
Come in.

1272
01:02:28,341 --> 01:02:30,639
Mr. Gailey to see you,
Your Honor.

1273
01:02:30,676 --> 01:02:31,973
He represents Mr. Kringle.

1274
01:02:33,446 --> 01:02:34,777
Better show him in.

1275
01:02:37,617 --> 01:02:38,948
GAILEY: Good morning.

1276
01:02:38,985 --> 01:02:41,579
Your Honor, there seems to be
undue haste in this case.

1277
01:02:41,621 --> 01:02:44,089
I wish to protect my client's
rights, as I'm sure you do.

1278
01:02:44,123 --> 01:02:45,249
HARPER: Of course.

1279
01:02:45,291 --> 01:02:47,418
GAILEY:
I request a formal hearing...

1280
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,121
to which I may bring witnesses.

1281
01:02:49,162 --> 01:02:51,790
- This is cut and dried?
- That's what I was told.

1282
01:02:51,831 --> 01:02:53,731
I didn't know anything
about a protest.

1283
01:02:53,766 --> 01:02:56,633
GAILEY: Of course, you may sign
the commitment papers now...

1284
01:02:56,669 --> 01:02:58,330
but I'll bring
a habeas corpus later.

1285
01:02:58,371 --> 01:03:00,839
There's no point in signing.

1286
01:03:00,873 --> 01:03:05,537
We'll have a hearing
on Monday morning at 10:00.

1287
01:03:05,578 --> 01:03:07,603
GAILEY: Thank you. Good day.

1288
01:03:12,285 --> 01:03:13,775
Thank you.

1289
01:03:18,790 --> 01:03:20,087
SAWYER: That man...

1290
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:23,253
I heard him say something
about Mr. Kringle before.

1291
01:03:23,295 --> 01:03:24,762
Who is he?

1292
01:03:24,796 --> 01:03:26,263
MARRAH: His name is Gailey,
Kringle's lawyer.

1293
01:03:26,298 --> 01:03:29,267
Probably grabbed the case
to get some cheap publicity.

1294
01:03:29,301 --> 01:03:32,270
SAWYER: We can't have that.
Mr. Macy would rather drop this.

1295
01:03:32,304 --> 01:03:33,771
MARRAH: It can't be done.
It's too late now.

1296
01:03:33,805 --> 01:03:36,273
Kringle has been examined by
city hospital psychiatrists.

1297
01:03:36,308 --> 01:03:37,866
It has to follow due process.

1298
01:03:37,909 --> 01:03:39,877
SAWYER: We must avoid publicity.

1299
01:03:39,911 --> 01:03:41,401
I, uh... Oh.

1300
01:03:50,222 --> 01:03:52,884
SAWYER: Mr. Gailey,
I represent Mr. Macy.

1301
01:03:52,924 --> 01:03:54,323
My name's Sawyer.

1302
01:03:54,359 --> 01:03:55,826
GAILEY: Oh, so you're Sawyer.

1303
01:03:55,861 --> 01:03:57,886
SAWYER: Yes.
Regarding this Kringle matter...

1304
01:03:57,929 --> 01:04:00,056
We're very anxious
to avoid any publicity.

1305
01:04:00,098 --> 01:04:01,326
GAILEY: Naturally.

1306
01:04:01,366 --> 01:04:04,563
SAWYER: So if you would agree
to put this through quietly...

1307
01:04:04,603 --> 01:04:07,834
we'd surely find a generous way
to express our appreciation.

1308
01:04:07,873 --> 01:04:09,033
GAILEY: Very interesting.

1309
01:04:09,074 --> 01:04:10,837
SAWYER: Then you'll cooperate?

1310
01:04:10,876 --> 01:04:13,743
GAILEY: Very interesting.
Publicity. Hmm.

1311
01:04:13,779 --> 01:04:15,542
That's not a bad idea.

1312
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:17,411
If I'm going to win this case...

1313
01:04:17,449 --> 01:04:19,747
I'll have to have plenty
of public opinion.

1314
01:04:19,785 --> 01:04:22,083
And publicity's
just the way to do it.

1315
01:04:24,423 --> 01:04:26,891
Thanks, Mr. Sawyer.

1316
01:04:26,925 --> 01:04:30,554
SAWYER:
Oh, Mr. Gailey, wait a minute.

1317
01:04:30,595 --> 01:04:33,086
Mr. Gailey, one moment, please!

1318
01:04:58,423 --> 01:05:01,221
HARPER: I don't see what
they're making a fuss about.

1319
01:05:01,259 --> 01:05:02,726
After all, he's an old man.

1320
01:05:02,761 --> 01:05:04,729
CHARLEY:
How've you been feeling lately?

1321
01:05:04,763 --> 01:05:06,355
You look a little run-down.

1322
01:05:06,398 --> 01:05:09,367
HARPER: Me? Why, I feel fine.
Never better.

1323
01:05:09,401 --> 01:05:11,869
CHARLEY: Why not see the doc?
Take a few weeks off.

1324
01:05:11,903 --> 01:05:14,872
Go fishing, go hunting.
Go anyplace.

1325
01:05:14,906 --> 01:05:16,874
HARPER: Why should I?

1326
01:05:16,908 --> 01:05:18,899
CHARLEY: Because
this Kringle case is dynamite.

1327
01:05:18,944 --> 01:05:21,913
Let some judge handle it that
isn't coming up for reelection.

1328
01:05:21,947 --> 01:05:23,380
HARPER: I can't do that.

1329
01:05:23,415 --> 01:05:24,882
CHARLEY:
I'm no legal brain trust.

1330
01:05:24,916 --> 01:05:27,749
I don't know
a habeas from a corpus.

1331
01:05:27,786 --> 01:05:30,254
But I do know politics.
That's my racket.

1332
01:05:30,288 --> 01:05:31,915
I got you elected, didn't I?

1333
01:05:31,957 --> 01:05:34,084
And I'm gonna try
to get you reelected.

1334
01:05:34,126 --> 01:05:37,926
HARPER: I appreciate everything
that you've done for me.

1335
01:05:37,963 --> 01:05:39,726
CHARLEY: Then get off this case.

1336
01:05:39,764 --> 01:05:41,254
HARPER: But why?

1337
01:05:41,299 --> 01:05:44,496
CHARLEY: You're a Pontius Pilate
the minute you start.

1338
01:05:44,536 --> 01:05:47,130
Oh, I don't believe it.

1339
01:05:47,172 --> 01:05:48,764
I'm an honest man...

1340

to hold it against me...

this will take?

SAWYER:
A week?! That seems impossible!

1366
01:07:03,081 --> 01:07:05,049
MARRAH: That lawyer
won't be stupid enough...

1367
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:07,677
to let him admit anything.
He'll deny everything.

the testimony you'll give
shall be the whole truth...

1380
01:07:54,266 --> 01:07:56,234
so help you God?

1381
01:07:56,268 --> 01:07:57,462
KRIS: I do.

1382
01:07:57,502 --> 01:08:00,562
HARPER: Before you begin, I want
to explain to the witness...

1383
01:08:00,605 --> 01:08:02,300
this is a hearing, not a trial.

1384
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:03,864
Mr. Kringle...

1385
01:08:03,908 --> 01:08:06,274
you don't have to answer
against your wishes...

1386
01:08:06,311 --> 01:08:08,939
or even testify at all.

1387
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:10,743
We have no objection,
Your Honor.

1388
01:08:12,484 --> 01:08:14,884
I'll be glad to answer
any questions I can.

1389
01:08:16,921 --> 01:08:18,912
What is your name?

1390
01:08:18,957 --> 01:08:20,117
Kris Kringle.

1391
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,227
Where do you live?

1392
01:08:23,261 --> 01:08:25,729
That's what this hearing
will decide.

1395
01:08:31,369 --> 01:08:33,929
A very sound answer,
Mr. Kringle.

1396
01:08:35,774 --> 01:08:37,935
MARRAH: Do you believe
that you're Santa Claus?

1397
01:08:37,976 --> 01:08:39,637
KRIS: Of course.

1398
01:08:44,983 --> 01:08:47,474
The state rests, Your Honor.

1399
01:08:55,226 --> 01:08:56,693
Well, Mr. Gailey...

1400
01:08:56,728 --> 01:08:59,196
do you wish to cross-examine
the witness?

1401
01:08:59,230 --> 01:09:01,391
I believe he was employed
to play Santa Claus.

1402
01:09:01,433 --> 01:09:04,027
Perhaps he didn't understand
the question correctly.

1403
01:09:04,069 --> 01:09:06,663
Oh, I understood perfectly,
Your Honor.

1404
01:09:10,942 --> 01:09:13,410
No further questions
at this time.

1405
01:09:16,915 --> 01:09:18,507
Thank you.

1406
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,581
HARPER:
In view of this statement...

1407
01:09:23,621 --> 01:09:26,556
do you still wish
to put in a defense?

1408
01:09:26,591 --> 01:09:28,559
GAILEY: I do, Your Honor.

1409
01:09:28,593 --> 01:09:31,892
I'm fully aware
of my client's opinions.

1410
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:33,261
That's the entire case
against him.

1411
01:09:33,298 --> 01:09:36,790
All these complicated tests
boil down to this:

1412
01:09:36,835 --> 01:09:39,030
Mr. Kringle is not sane...

1413
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:40,867
because he believes himself
to be Santa Claus.

1414
01:09:40,905 --> 01:09:42,236
An entirely logical...

1415
01:09:42,273 --> 01:09:44,867
and reasonable assumption,
I'm afraid.

1416
01:09:44,909 --> 01:09:48,242
It would be if the clerk,
Mr. Marrah, or I...

1417
01:09:48,279 --> 01:09:49,837
believed we were Santa Claus.

1418
01:09:49,881 --> 01:09:52,543
Anyone who thinks
he's Santa Claus is not sane.

1419
01:09:52,584 --> 01:09:54,142
GAILEY: Not necessarily.

1420
01:09:54,185 --> 01:09:56,653
You believe yourself
to be Judge Harper...

1421
01:09:56,688 --> 01:09:59,953
yet no one questions your sanity
because you are Judge Harper.

1422
01:09:59,991 --> 01:10:02,687
I know all about myself,
young man.

1423
01:10:02,727 --> 01:10:04,524
Mr. Kringle is the subject
of this hearing.

1424
01:10:04,562 --> 01:10:05,722
GAILEY: Yes, Your Honor...

1425
01:10:05,764 --> 01:10:08,699
and if he is the person
he believes himself to be...

1426
01:10:08,733 --> 01:10:11,827
just as you are,
then he's just as sane.

1427
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:13,030
Granted, but he isn't.

1428
01:10:13,071 --> 01:10:14,197
GAILEY: Oh, but he is.

1429
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:15,907
HARPER: Is what?

1430
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:19,009
I intend to prove
that Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus.

1431
01:10:20,745 --> 01:10:22,872
MARRAH: He's crazy, too!

1436
01:10:37,795 --> 01:10:40,628
Sorry I'm late. Get your coat.
I reserved our table at Luigi's.

1437
01:10:40,665 --> 01:10:41,791
We're gonna celebrate.

1438
01:10:41,832 --> 01:10:43,265
DORIS: What are we celebrating?

1439
01:10:43,301 --> 01:10:45,769
GAILEY: Read all about it.
"Gailey Throws Court Bombshell."

1440
01:10:45,803 --> 01:10:47,771
DORIS: Yes, I read that.

1441
01:10:47,805 --> 01:10:50,774
GAILEY: I didn't see this...
Front page! Good. Good.

1442
01:10:50,808 --> 01:10:52,742
DORIS:
You're not serious about this?

1443
01:10:52,777 --> 01:10:54,244
GAILEY: Of course I am.

1444
01:10:54,278 --> 01:10:56,746
DORIS: But you can't possibly
prove he's Santa Claus.

1445
01:10:56,781 --> 01:10:59,306
GAILEY: Why not? You saw Macy
and Gimbel shaking hands.

1446
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:01,818
That wasn't possible either,
but it happened.

1447
01:11:01,852 --> 01:11:03,285
It's the best defense I can use.

1448
01:11:03,321 --> 01:11:05,789
Completely logical
and completely unexpected.

1449
01:11:05,823 --> 01:11:07,313
DORIS: And completely idiotic.

1450
01:11:07,358 --> 01:11:08,825
What about your bosses...

1451
01:11:08,859 --> 01:11:10,588
Haislip and Mackenzie
and the rest?

1452
01:11:10,628 --> 01:11:11,754
What do they say?

1453
01:11:11,796 --> 01:11:13,764
GAILEY: That I'm jeopardizing
the prestige and dignity...

1454
01:11:13,798 --> 01:11:15,766
of an old, established
law firm...

1455
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,268
and either I drop this
impossible case immediately...

1456
01:11:18,302 --> 01:11:19,769
or they will drop me.

1457
01:11:19,804 --> 01:11:21,328
I beat them to it. I quit.

1458
01:11:21,372 --> 01:11:22,839
DORIS: Fred, you didn't.

1459
01:11:22,873 --> 01:11:25,034
GAILEY: Of course I did.
I can't let Kris down.

1460
01:11:25,076 --> 01:11:27,840
He needs me,
and all the rest of us need him.

1461
01:11:27,878 --> 01:11:29,641
DORIS: Darling,
he's a nice old man...

1462
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:33,582
and I admire you
for wanting to help him...

1463
01:11:33,617 --> 01:11:36,085
but you've got to be realistic
and face facts.

1464
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,088
You can't just
throw your career away...

1465
01:11:38,122 --> 01:11:39,783
because of a sentimental whim.

1466
01:11:39,824 --> 01:11:41,792
GAILEY: But I'm not
throwing my career away.

1467
01:11:41,826 --> 01:11:43,794
DORIS:
If Haislip feels that way...

1468
01:11:43,828 --> 01:11:45,796
so will every other law firm.

1469
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:48,298
GAILEY: I'm sure they will.
I'll open my own office.

1470
01:11:48,332 --> 01:11:50,800
DORIS:
What kind of cases will you get?

1471
01:11:50,835 --> 01:11:53,804
GAILEY: Probably people like
Kris who are being bullied.

1472
01:11:53,838 --> 01:11:55,806
That's the only fun in law
anyway.

1473
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,741
If you believe in me
and have faith in me...

1474
01:11:58,776 --> 01:12:00,573
everything will...

1475
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:05,242
You don't have any faith in me,
do you?

1476
01:12:05,282 --> 01:12:08,945
It's not about faith.
It's just common sense.

1477
01:12:10,788 --> 01:12:12,915
Faith is believing in things...

1478
01:12:12,957 --> 01:12:15,755
when common sense
tells you not to.

1479
01:12:15,793 --> 01:12:18,353
It's not just Kris
that's on trial.

1480
01:12:18,396 --> 01:12:19,920
It's everything he stands for.

1481
01:12:19,964 --> 01:12:21,989
It's kindness, joy, love,
and all other intangibles.

1482
01:12:22,033 --> 01:12:23,864
DORIS: Fred,
you're talking like a child.

1483
01:12:23,901 --> 01:12:25,391
You're living
in a realistic world!

1484
01:12:25,436 --> 01:12:26,903
Those lovely intangibles
aren't worth much.

1485
01:12:26,937 --> 01:12:28,427
You don't get ahead that way.

1486
01:12:28,472 --> 01:12:31,270
GAILEY: That all depends
on what you call getting ahead.

1487
01:12:31,308 --> 01:12:33,276
Evidently,
we have different definitions.

1488
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:35,778
DORIS: We've talked
about wonderful plans.

1489
01:12:35,813 --> 01:12:37,940
Then you go
on an idealistic binge.

1490
01:12:37,982 --> 01:12:40,780
You give up your job,
throw away your security...

1491
01:12:40,818 --> 01:12:43,946
and then you expect me
to be happy about it!

1492
01:12:43,988 --> 01:12:47,287
GAILEY: Yes,
I guess I expected too much.

1493
01:12:47,324 --> 01:12:49,451
Someday,
you're going to find out...

1494
01:12:49,493 --> 01:12:51,290
that your way of facing
this realistic world...

1495
01:12:51,328 --> 01:12:52,795
just doesn't work.

1496
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:54,229
And when you do...

1497
01:12:54,265 --> 01:12:56,062
don't overlook
those lovely intangibles.

1498
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,897
You'll discover
they're the only things...

1499
01:12:57,935 --> 01:12:59,266
that are worthwhile.

1500
01:13:07,778 --> 01:13:10,338
MARRAH: These reporters make me
look like a sadistic monster...

1501
01:13:10,381 --> 01:13:11,848
who likes to drown cats...

1502
01:13:11,882 --> 01:13:13,747
and tear the wings
off butterflies.

1503
01:13:13,784 --> 01:13:14,910
Why, this old man...

1504
01:13:14,952 --> 01:13:18,410
MRS. MARRAH: Tommy, go get
mother's scissors, will you?

1505
01:13:18,456 --> 01:13:20,424
They're in the bedroom.

1506
01:13:20,458 --> 01:13:22,449
That's a good boy.

1507
01:13:23,894 --> 01:13:26,362
I don't want to discuss
this case in front of him.

1508
01:13:26,397 --> 01:13:28,262
It'll break his heart.

1509
01:13:28,299 --> 01:13:30,267
While we're on the subject,
I agree with the reporters.

1510
01:13:30,301 --> 01:13:32,269
Mr. Kringle seems
to be a nice old man.

1511
01:13:32,303 --> 01:13:34,771
I don't see why you have
to keep persecuting him.

1512
01:13:34,805 --> 01:13:36,773
MARRAH: Firstly,
I am not persecuting him.

1513
01:13:36,807 --> 01:13:38,274
I am prosecuting him.

1514
01:13:38,309 --> 01:13:40,937
And secondly,
I like the old man, too.

1515
01:13:40,978 --> 01:13:43,276
I wish
I'd never gotten into this.

1516
01:13:43,314 --> 01:13:45,782
But it's too late now. There's
nothing I can do about it.

1517
01:13:45,816 --> 01:13:47,784
It's up to the state
of New York.

1518
01:13:47,818 --> 01:13:49,285
I'm their duly appointed
legal representative.

1519
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,288
Kringle has been declared
a menace to society...

1520
01:13:51,322 --> 01:13:52,949
by competent doctors.

1521
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:55,220
It's my duty to protect
the state of New York...

1522
01:13:55,259 --> 01:13:56,886
and see that he's put away.

1523
01:13:56,927 --> 01:13:58,827
No matter what they say
about me...

1524
01:13:58,863 --> 01:14:00,387
I've got to do it.

1525
01:14:00,431 --> 01:14:03,730
Sometimes I wish I'd married
a butcher or a plumber.

1526
01:14:03,767 --> 01:14:06,395
MARRAH: Well, my dear,
if I lose this case...

1527
01:14:06,437 --> 01:14:08,769
it's very possible
that you'll get your wish.

1528
01:14:20,784 --> 01:14:22,183
Hello, Kris.

1529
01:14:34,131 --> 01:14:35,598

MACY: R.H. Macy.

GAILEY: You are the owner...

1532
01:14:38,235 --> 01:14:39,702
of one of the biggest
department stores...

1533
01:14:39,737 --> 01:14:40,965
in New York City?

1534
01:14:41,005 --> 01:14:42,131
MACY: The biggest.

1535
01:14:42,173 --> 01:14:45,574
Who is the gentleman
seated there?

1536
01:14:45,609 --> 01:14:46,803
MACY: Kris Kringle.

1537
01:14:46,844 --> 01:14:48,277
- Your employee?
- Yes.

1538
01:14:48,312 --> 01:14:49,939
GAILEY: Do you believe him
to be truthful?

1539
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:51,106
MACY: Yes.

1540
01:14:51,148 --> 01:14:53,284
GAILEY: You believe him to be
of sound mind?

1541
01:14:53,284 --> 01:14:54,376
MACY: I certainly do.

1542
01:14:54,418 --> 01:14:56,215
MARRAH:
Mr. Macy, you're under oath.

1543
01:14:56,253 --> 01:14:58,414
You really believe
this man is Santa Claus?

1544
01:14:58,455 --> 01:15:00,753
Well, I...

1545
01:15:05,429 --> 01:15:07,989
Well, he gives
every indication...

1546
01:15:08,032 --> 01:15:11,433
MARRAH: Do you really believe
he's Santa Claus?

1547
01:15:19,777 --> 01:15:21,267
MACY: I do.

1548
01:15:21,312 --> 01:15:22,438
MARRAH: You do?

1549
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:23,969
GAILEY: That's all.

1550
01:15:24,014 --> 01:15:25,311
[Gavel pounding]

1551
01:15:36,627 --> 01:15:38,322
MACY: Psychologist!

1552
01:15:38,362 --> 01:15:41,456
Where'd you graduate from,
a correspondence school?

1553
01:15:42,466 --> 01:15:43,956
You're fired.

1554
01:15:45,736 --> 01:15:47,761
Your Honor,
I object to this testimony.

1555
01:15:47,805 --> 01:15:49,773
It's ridiculous, irrelevant,
and immaterial.

1556
01:15:49,807 --> 01:15:51,934
Mr. Gailey is making
a circus of this court.

1557
01:15:51,976 --> 01:15:53,705
There is no such person
as Santa Claus...

1558
01:15:53,744 --> 01:15:55,211
and everybody knows it.

1559
01:15:55,246 --> 01:15:57,714
GAILEY: I submit
it's purely a matter of opinion.

1560
01:15:57,748 --> 01:16:00,114
Can Mr. Marrah disprove
Santa's existence?

1561
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:01,879
MARRAH: No. I don't intend to.

1562
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:04,353
This isn't a nursery. It's the
New York State Supreme Court.

1563
01:16:04,388 --> 01:16:06,879
I'll not waste this court's time
with such nonsense!

1564
01:16:06,924 --> 01:16:08,892
GAILEY: Mr. Marrah seems to have
appointed himself judge.

1565
01:16:08,926 --> 01:16:11,895
He's ruling on what testimony
I may introduce.

1566
01:16:11,929 --> 01:16:14,727
MARRAH: We request an immediate
ruling from this court.

1567
01:16:14,765 --> 01:16:17,290
Is there or is there not
a Santa Claus?

1568
01:16:19,436 --> 01:16:20,903
Well...

1569
01:16:20,938 --> 01:16:22,735
CHARLEY: Ahem!

1570
01:16:28,445 --> 01:16:31,846
The court will take a recess
to consider the matter.

1571
01:16:34,785 --> 01:16:37,754
I don't care what you do
with old whisker puss...

1572
01:16:37,788 --> 01:16:40,256
but if you rule
that there's no Santa Claus...

1573
01:16:40,291 --> 01:16:42,759
you better start looking
for that chicken farm.

1574
01:16:42,793 --> 01:16:46,251
We won't even be able
to put you in the primaries.

1575
01:16:46,297 --> 01:16:48,288
HARPER:
But, Charley, listen to reason.

1576
01:16:48,332 --> 01:16:50,300
I'm a responsible judge.

1577
01:16:50,334 --> 01:16:52,302
I've taken an oath.

1578
01:16:52,336 --> 01:16:55,328
How can I seriously rule
there is a Santa Claus?

1579
01:16:55,372 --> 01:16:57,363
CHARLEY: Why don't you...

1580
01:16:58,876 --> 01:17:00,343
All right.

1581
01:17:00,377 --> 01:17:03,835
Tell them the New York
State Supreme Court rules...

1582
01:17:03,881 --> 01:17:05,348
there's no Santa Claus.

1583
01:17:05,382 --> 01:17:06,610
It's all over the papers.

1584
01:17:06,650 --> 01:17:08,845
The kids don't hang up
their stockings.

1585
01:17:08,886 --> 01:17:11,184
Now, what happens
to all the toys...

1586
01:17:11,221 --> 01:17:13,348
that are supposed to be
in those stockings?

1587
01:17:13,390 --> 01:17:14,857
Nobody buys them.

1588
01:17:14,892 --> 01:17:17,360
The toy manufacturers
are going to like that.

1589
01:17:17,394 --> 01:17:20,557
So they have to lay off
a lot of their employees...

1590
01:17:20,597 --> 01:17:22,565
union employees.

1591
01:17:22,599 --> 01:17:26,228
Now you got the C.I.O.
And the A.F.L. against you.

1592
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:28,740
And they're gonna adore you
for it.

1593
01:17:28,873 --> 01:17:31,967
And they're gonna say it
with votes.

1594
01:17:32,009 --> 01:17:34,910
And the department stores
will love you, too...

1595
01:17:34,946 --> 01:17:37,574
and the Christmas card makers...

1596
01:17:37,615 --> 01:17:39,082
and the candy companies.

1597
01:17:39,117 --> 01:17:43,918
Oh, Henry, you're going to be
an awful popular fellow.

1598
01:17:43,955 --> 01:17:46,321
And what about
the Salvation Army?

1599
01:17:46,357 --> 01:17:48,848
Why, they got a Santa Claus
on every corner...

1600
01:17:48,893 --> 01:17:50,554
and they take in a fortune.

1601
01:17:50,595 --> 01:17:51,926
But you go ahead, Henry.

1602
01:17:51,963 --> 01:17:54,193
You do it your way.

1603
01:17:54,232 --> 01:17:56,700
You go on back in there
and tell them...

1604
01:17:56,734 --> 01:17:59,794
that you rule
there's no Santa Claus.

1605
01:18:00,805 --> 01:18:03,205
But if you do, remember this:

1606
01:18:03,241 --> 01:18:05,072
You can count on getting
just two votes...

1607
01:18:05,109 --> 01:18:07,873
your own and that
district attorney's out there.

1608
01:18:10,414 --> 01:18:12,609
The district attorney's
a Republican.

1609
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:13,776
[Pounds]

1610
01:18:13,818 --> 01:18:14,978
BAILIFF: All rise!

1611
01:18:31,936 --> 01:18:33,904
HARPER:
Before making a ruling...

1612
01:18:33,938 --> 01:18:38,034
this court has consulted
the highest authority available.

1613
01:18:40,178 --> 01:18:42,237
The question of Santa Claus...

1614
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:44,510
seems to be largely
a matter of opinion.

1615
01:18:44,549 --> 01:18:47,416
Many people
firmly believe in him.

1616
01:18:47,451 --> 01:18:49,419
Others do not.

1617
01:18:49,453 --> 01:18:52,616
The tradition
of American justice demands...

1618
01:18:52,657 --> 01:18:56,650
a broad, unprejudiced view
of such a controversial matter.

1619
01:18:56,694 --> 01:19:01,688
This court, therefore,
intends to keep an open mind.

1620
01:19:01,732 --> 01:19:03,529
I'll hear all the evidence.

1621
01:19:03,568 --> 01:19:05,399
MARRAH: He's crazy, too.

1622
01:19:07,071 --> 01:19:10,199
The burden of proof for this
ridiculous contention...

1623
01:19:10,241 --> 01:19:11,708
clearly rests with my opponent.

1624
01:19:11,742 --> 01:19:14,711
Can he produce evidence
to support his views?

1625
01:19:14,745 --> 01:19:16,713
GAILEY:
If Your Honor pleases, I can.

1626
01:19:16,747 --> 01:19:18,214
Will Thomas Marrah
please take the stand?

1627
01:19:18,249 --> 01:19:19,409
MARRAH: Who, me?

1628
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:21,475
GAILEY: Thomas Marrah, Jr.

1629
01:19:32,897 --> 01:19:34,387
Hello, Daddy.

1630
01:19:36,868 --> 01:19:38,859
GAILEY: Here you are, Tommy.

1631
01:19:41,505 --> 01:19:43,973
HARPER: Tommy,
you know the difference...

1632
01:19:44,008 --> 01:19:46,533
between telling the truth
and telling a lie, right?

1633
01:19:46,577 --> 01:19:50,104
TOMMY: Everybody knows you
shouldn't tell a lie...

1634
01:19:50,147 --> 01:19:52,172
especially in court.

1635
01:19:52,216 --> 01:19:53,774
[Audience laughing]

01:19:53,818 --> 01:19:55,183
HARPER: Proceed, Mr. Gailey.

1637
01:19:55,219 --> 01:19:56,948
GAILEY:
Do you believe in Santa Claus?

1638
01:19:56,988 --> 01:19:58,922
TOMMY: Sure I do.

1639
01:19:58,956 --> 01:20:03,052
He gave me a brand-new
flexible flyer sled last year.

1640
01:20:03,094 --> 01:20:06,427
GAILEY:
And what does he look like?

1641
01:20:06,464 --> 01:20:08,955
TOMMY:
There he is, sitting there.

1642
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,558
Your Honor, I protest!

1643
01:20:11,969 --> 01:20:13,960
Overruled.

1644
01:20:15,406 --> 01:20:16,703
GAILEY: Tell me, Tommy...

1645
01:20:16,741 --> 01:20:19,938
why are you so sure
there's a Santa Claus?

1646
01:20:19,977 --> 01:20:22,946
TOMMY:
Because my daddy told me so.

1647
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:24,641
Didn't you, Daddy?

1648
01:20:24,682 --> 01:20:26,741
[Laughter]

1649
01:20:26,784 --> 01:20:28,718
GAILEY: You believe your daddy,
don't you?

1650
01:20:28,753 --> 01:20:30,448
He's a very honest man.

1651
01:20:30,488 --> 01:20:31,648
Of course he is.

1652
01:20:31,689 --> 01:20:34,658
My daddy wouldn't tell me
anything that wasn't so.

1653
01:20:34,692 --> 01:20:36,660
Would you, Daddy?

1654
01:20:36,694 --> 01:20:38,184
[Laughter]

1655
01:20:39,397 --> 01:20:40,762
GAILEY: Thank you, Tommy.

1656
01:20:44,468 --> 01:20:45,594
Good-bye, Daddy.

1657
01:20:45,636 --> 01:20:46,762
[Laughter]

1658
01:20:46,804 --> 01:20:49,034
Your Honor...

1659
01:20:49,073 --> 01:20:52,042
TOMMY: Don't forget.
A real official football helmet.

1660
01:20:52,076 --> 01:20:54,806
KRIS: Don't worry, Tommy.
You'll get it.

1661
01:20:54,845 --> 01:20:57,336
[Laughter]

1662
01:21:12,797 --> 01:21:14,264
Your Honor,
the state of New York...

1663
01:21:14,298 --> 01:21:16,630
concedes the existence
of Santa Claus.

1664
01:21:22,773 --> 01:21:26,231
But we ask that Mr. Gailey
cease presenting...

1665
01:21:26,277 --> 01:21:28,245
personal opinion as evidence.

1666
01:21:28,279 --> 01:21:31,112
We could bring witnesses
with opposite opinions...

1667
01:21:31,148 --> 01:21:33,378
but we desire
to shorten this hearing...

1668
01:21:33,417 --> 01:21:35,248
rather than prolong it.

1669
01:21:35,286 --> 01:21:37,254
I request that Mr. Gailey...

1670
01:21:37,288 --> 01:21:38,778
now submit
authoritative proof...

1671
01:21:38,823 --> 01:21:40,381
that Mr. Kringle...

1672
01:21:40,424 --> 01:21:43,018
is the one-and-only Santa Claus.

1673
01:21:44,328 --> 01:21:46,193
Your point's well taken.

1674
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:48,926
I'm afraid we must agree.

1675
01:21:53,771 --> 01:21:57,730
Mr. Gailey, can you show that
Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus...

1676
01:21:57,775 --> 01:22:00,039
on the basis
of competent authority?

1677
01:22:01,746 --> 01:22:03,714
Not at this time, Your Honor.

1678
01:22:03,748 --> 01:22:06,342
I ask for an adjournment
until tomorrow.

1679
01:22:06,384 --> 01:22:09,217
Court stands adjourned
till tomorrow afternoon, 3:00.

1680
01:22:14,825 --> 01:22:17,293
ALFRED:
Well, I guess that's that.

1681
01:22:17,328 --> 01:22:19,057
DORIS: There's a way, Alfred.

1682
01:22:19,096 --> 01:22:20,654
There's got to be!

1683
01:22:26,337 --> 01:22:28,305
DORIS: It's hard to explain.

1684
01:22:28,339 --> 01:22:31,308
They're having a trial
about him.

1685
01:22:31,342 --> 01:22:33,310
SUZIE: You mean like for murder?

1686
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:35,278
DORIS: No, it isn't that kind
of a trial.

1687
01:22:35,312 --> 01:22:37,803
It's just because
he says he's Santa Claus.

1688
01:22:37,848 --> 01:22:40,817
SUZIE: I've got a feeling
he is Santa Claus.

1689
01:22:40,851 --> 01:22:43,786
DORIS: Some people don't
believe that. That's why...

1690
01:22:43,821 --> 01:22:46,790
SUZIE: But he's so kind
and nice and jolly.

1691
01:22:46,824 --> 01:22:49,292
He's not like anyone else.

1692
01:22:49,326 --> 01:22:51,294
He must be Santa.

1693
01:22:51,328 --> 01:22:53,558
DORIS: I think
perhaps you're right, Suzie.

1694

SUZIE: Is Mr. Kringle sad now,

DORIS: I'm afraid he is.

I seen them write
to Santa Claus...

"Kris Kringle,
New York County Courthouse."

and the D.A. Claims he's nuts.

about 50,000 of them.

Bags and bags
all over the joint.

And there's more coming in
every day.

WORKER: Yeah. Hey, Lou.

1715

It'd be nice
to get rid of them, huh?

LOU: Yeah, but...

1717
01:25:04,795 --> 01:25:07,263
Hey, that's a wonderful idea!

1718
01:25:07,297 --> 01:25:10,266
WORKER: Why should we be
bothered with all that stuff?

1719
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:12,734
Why not get some trucks?
Big ones right away.

1720
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:15,762
Load them with Santa Claus mail
and deliver it...

GAILEY: Kris, I'm afraid
I've got bad news for you.

1728
01:25:45,836 --> 01:25:49,294
I've tried every way to get
some competent authority.

1729
01:25:49,339 --> 01:25:51,603
I've wired the governor,
the mayor. I even...

1730

KRIS:
This is worth more to me...

than all the governors
and mayors in the world.

MARRAH:
It's all over. Look at him.

1733
01:25:58,082 --> 01:25:59,913
He hasn't got a thing.

1734
01:26:16,333 --> 01:26:19,496
MARRAH: And furthermore,
the defense has yet to offer...

1735
01:26:19,536 --> 01:26:22,004
one concrete
piece of evidence...

1736
01:26:22,039 --> 01:26:24,507
to substantiate
this preposterous claim.

that this man is Santa Claus.

have you anything further
to offer?

1745
01:26:42,259 --> 01:26:43,749
Yes, I have, Your Honor.

1746
01:26:43,794 --> 01:26:46,763
I'd like to submit the following
facts in evidence.

1747
01:26:46,797 --> 01:26:48,628
It concerns
the Post Office Department...

1748
01:26:48,665 --> 01:26:52,123
an official agency
of the United States government.

any bearing on this case.

I have just quoted...

indicate an efficiently run
organization.

1764
01:27:34,278 --> 01:27:37,406
United States postal laws
and regulations...

1765
01:27:37,447 --> 01:27:40,678
make it a criminal offense
to willfully misdirect mail...

or intentionally deliver it
to the wrong party.

Consequently...

every possible precaution.

as positive proof that...

MARRAH: Uh, three letters
are hardly positive proof.

receives thousands of these.

1842
01:32:23,366 --> 01:32:25,698
but I thought
there'd be a letter.

1843
01:32:25,735 --> 01:32:28,761
KRIS: I don't suppose
you even want to talk to me.

1844
01:32:28,805 --> 01:32:30,773
DORIS:
Something about a present.

1845
01:32:30,807 --> 01:32:32,775
KRIS: Yes, I know.
I'm sorry, Suzie.

1846
01:32:32,809 --> 01:32:35,277
I tried my best, but...

1847
01:32:35,312 --> 01:32:38,145
SUZIE: You couldn't get it
because you're not Santa.

1848
01:32:38,181 --> 01:32:41,150
You're just a nice old man
with whiskers...

1849
01:32:41,184 --> 01:32:42,708
like my mother said...

1850
01:32:42,752 --> 01:32:44,982
and I shouldn't have
believed you.

1851
01:32:46,323 --> 01:32:49,383
DORIS: I was wrong
when I told you that.

1852
01:32:49,426 --> 01:32:52,793
You must believe in Mr. Kringle
and keep right on doing it.

1853
01:32:52,829 --> 01:32:54,228
You must have faith in him.

1854
01:32:54,264 --> 01:32:56,732
SUZIE:
But he didn't get me the...

1855
01:32:56,766 --> 01:32:58,700
That doesn't make sense, Mommy.

1856
01:32:58,735 --> 01:33:00,999
DORIS:
Faith is believing in things...

1857
01:33:01,037 --> 01:33:03,164
when common sense
tells you not to.

1858
01:33:03,206 --> 01:33:04,730
SUZIE: Huh?

1859
01:33:04,774 --> 01:33:07,208
DORIS: Just because things
don't turn out...

1860
01:33:07,243 --> 01:33:09,268
the way you want them to
the first time...

1861
01:33:09,312 --> 01:33:11,746
you've still got to believe
in people.

1862
01:33:11,781 --> 01:33:13,749
I found that out.

1863
01:33:13,783 --> 01:33:15,250
SUZIE: You mean like...

1864
01:33:15,285 --> 01:33:18,686
"If at first you don't succeed,
try, try again"?

1865
01:33:18,722 --> 01:33:19,848
DORIS: Yes.

1866
01:33:19,889 --> 01:33:21,789
SUZIE: I thought so.

1867
01:33:25,161 --> 01:33:27,129
GAILEY: May I drive you home?

1868
01:33:27,163 --> 01:33:28,289
DORIS: Thank you.

1869
01:33:28,331 --> 01:33:31,198
KRIS: If you'll go this way,
you'll miss a lot of traffic.

1870
01:33:31,234 --> 01:33:33,429
You go along Maplewood
until you've come to Ashley...

1871
01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:37,406
I believe. I believe.
It's silly, but I believe.

1872
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:40,102
GAILEY: Thanks, Kris.
Merry Christmas.

1873
01:33:40,143 --> 01:33:41,371
KRIS: Merry Christmas to you.

1874
01:33:41,411 --> 01:33:44,244
And to you, my dear,
and many of them.

1875
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:46,271
Good-bye, my dear.

1876
01:33:46,316 --> 01:33:48,250
ALFRED: Good-bye, Mrs. Walker.

1877
01:33:48,284 --> 01:33:49,751
DORIS: Good-bye, Alfred.

1878
01:33:49,786 --> 01:33:51,276
KRIS: Good-bye, Suzie.

1879
01:33:54,824 --> 01:33:57,691
DORIS:
This must be the turn here.

1880
01:33:57,727 --> 01:33:59,695
That's right. Ashley.

1881
01:33:59,729 --> 01:34:02,721
Now you go straight
for four blocks.

1882
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,834
I believe. I believe.

1883
01:34:11,307 --> 01:34:13,639
Stop, Uncle Fred! Stop!

1884
01:34:13,676 --> 01:34:15,644
Stop! Stop!

1885
01:34:19,315 --> 01:34:20,509
DORIS: Suzie!

1886
01:34:21,518 --> 01:34:22,712
Suzie!

1887
01:34:24,854 --> 01:34:26,481
Suzie, where are you going?

1888
01:34:26,523 --> 01:34:28,047
GAILEY: What is she doing?

1889
01:34:28,091 --> 01:34:30,116
- Suzie!
- Suzie!

1890
01:34:32,362 --> 01:34:34,762
GAILEY: Suzie, where are you?

1891
01:34:34,798 --> 01:34:36,265
SUZIE: I'm upstairs!

1892
01:34:36,299 --> 01:34:38,267
DORIS: You shouldn't run around
in other people's houses.

1893
01:34:38,301 --> 01:34:39,768
You know better than that.

1894
01:34:39,803 --> 01:34:43,830
SUZIE: But this is my house,
the one I asked Mr. Kringle for.

1895
01:34:43,873 --> 01:34:45,670
It is! I know it is!

1896
01:34:45,708 --> 01:34:48,609
My room upstairs is like
I knew it would be!

1897
01:34:48,645 --> 01:34:49,805
You were right, Mommy.

1898
01:34:49,846 --> 01:34:53,942
Mommy said if things
don't turn out right at first...

1899
01:34:53,983 --> 01:34:56,008
you've still got to believe.

1900
01:34:56,052 --> 01:34:57,986
I kept believing.
You were right, Mommy!

1901
01:34:58,021 --> 01:35:00,421
Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus!

1902
01:35:00,457 --> 01:35:02,220
DORIS: Where are you going?

1903
01:35:02,258 --> 01:35:03,748
SUZIE:
To see if there's a swing!

1904
01:35:05,094 --> 01:35:07,028
There is one! There is one!

1905
01:35:11,768 --> 01:35:13,759
GAILEY: You told her that?

1906
01:35:22,779 --> 01:35:26,408
The sign outside
said it's for sale.

1907
01:35:26,449 --> 01:35:28,178
We can't let her down.

1908
01:35:30,053 --> 01:35:31,987
DORIS:
I never really doubted you.

1909
01:35:32,021 --> 01:35:34,751
It was just
my silly common sense.

1910
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:37,760
GAILEY: It even makes sense
to believe in me now.

1911
01:35:37,794 --> 01:35:40,262
I must be a pretty good lawyer.

1912
01:35:40,296 --> 01:35:41,763
I take a little old man...

1913
01:35:41,798 --> 01:35:43,766
and legally prove
that he's Santa Claus.

1914
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,290
Now, you know that...

1915
01:35:55,745 --> 01:35:58,213
DORIS: Oh, no. It can't be.

1916
01:35:58,248 --> 01:36:00,910
It must have been left
by the people that moved out.

1917
01:36:01,918 --> 01:36:03,078
GAILEY: Maybe.

1918
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:08,757
Maybe I didn't do such
a wonderful thing after all.

1919
01:36:09,305 --> 01:37:09,844
