3
00:00:20,256 --> 00:00:23,695
What do we
have here?

4
00:00:23,728 --> 00:00:25,228
Well, there's
a lot of evidence.

5
00:00:25,262 --> 00:00:28,799
The gun was left here
and the daughter told us

6
00:00:28,832 --> 00:00:30,902
about a friend
who slept here all night.

7
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:32,302
Hey.

8
00:00:36,307 --> 00:00:39,944
- Kinky sex overdone.
- Oh, yeah.

9
00:00:39,976 --> 00:00:42,979
- Least he had fun, though, right?
- Who's the gun registered to?

10
00:00:43,012 --> 00:00:44,948
We're not sure yet.
Uh, we just sent it in,

11
00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:46,250
so we're waiting
to hear back.

12
00:00:46,283 --> 00:00:47,417
If I understand
this correctly,

13
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:48,753
this is the third death
this week

14
00:00:48,786 --> 00:00:50,420
within the
Verica Corporation?

15
00:00:50,454 --> 00:00:52,790
- Yeah.
- Yeah, case getting interesting.

16
00:01:01,531 --> 00:01:03,435
- Yeah.
- <i>Detective James Franklin.</i>

17
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:05,469
Who's this?

18
00:01:05,503 --> 00:01:06,971
<i>Someone who's going
to tell you</i>

19
00:01:07,004 --> 00:01:09,007
<i>everything about
Mr. Nour's death.</i>

20
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,810
Well, how will I...

21
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:17,882
Trace it.
Stop touching yourself.

22
00:01:29,393 --> 00:01:31,929
- Who the hell are you?
- Lucinda Kavsky, CIA.

23
00:01:31,962 --> 00:01:37,135
- I will tell you everything I know about this case, okay?
- Okay.

24
00:01:45,843 --> 00:01:47,778
Well, hot damn if don't
believe that story.

25
00:01:48,513 --> 00:01:50,014
How'd you get
into this mess?

26
00:01:50,046 --> 00:01:52,884
You know, I think you're going to have
to contact Rodney Williams at the CIA.

27
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:55,118
- No other choice.
- I already sent the proof to him.

28
00:01:55,151 --> 00:01:57,454
You got to tell him about the
other bombs inside the kids.

29
00:01:57,487 --> 00:01:59,824
- Where are they now?
- They're still in China.

30
00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:02,026
This week, all the families
with bomb-bearing kids

31
00:02:02,058 --> 00:02:06,296
mysteriously won a vacation on the
radio from the same tour company.

32
00:02:07,298 --> 00:02:08,533
One family goes to India,

33
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:10,534
another to Africa
and one to Russia.

34
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:15,072
The trips start next week,
which means in a week,

35
00:02:15,104 --> 00:02:18,108
we will have a big bang,
Detective Franklin.

36
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:19,911
Okay, well, I got
one question for you.

37
00:02:21,478 --> 00:02:23,046
Why do you need to kill
the scientists?

38
00:02:24,114 --> 00:02:25,383
Do you think they
deserve to live?

39
00:02:27,918 --> 00:02:30,254
I'm gonna pretend like
I didn't hear that.

40
00:02:30,287 --> 00:02:33,424
Aside from these three,
nobody else can create this bomb.

41
00:02:33,456 --> 00:02:37,227
- They knew the formula by heart.
- Makes sense.

42
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,896
Your explanation's
good enough for me.

43
00:02:41,899 --> 00:02:43,234
We have a tail.

44
00:02:44,634 --> 00:02:47,137
I'm not surprised.
You've got to lose them.

45
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,841
I'm not used to running away.
Normally, I do the exact opposite. Hold on.

46
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:09,360
Move. Move, James!

47
00:03:09,393 --> 00:03:11,062
- Floor it.
- Let's go. Let's go. Let's go!

48
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:20,170
I'm telling you,
these sons of bitches are crazy.

49
00:03:21,572 --> 00:03:23,540
Not too shabby.
Not too shabby.

50
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:36,020
Oh, shit. At least they're
good for something.

51
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:41,057
Detective James Franklin to Dispatch.
Officer under fire, Highway 4A.

52
00:03:41,091 --> 00:03:45,263
The suspects are armed and dangerous
and they're actively chasing me.

53
00:03:45,295 --> 00:03:49,432
We're headed towards 63rd Street.
They are in a black SUV.

54
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:55,039
License plate
number 368498.

55
00:03:55,072 --> 00:03:56,574
Damn it.
We need backup immediately.

56
00:03:56,606 --> 00:03:59,943
- Now you're gonna get your backup.
- Careful, Lucinda.

57
00:04:12,588 --> 00:04:14,225
Hold on.

58
00:04:14,257 --> 00:04:15,560
Shit, where
is the backup?

59
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:37,147
We're not gonna make it.

60
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:43,653
Bad news. Bad news.
Brakes are gone.

61
00:04:43,687 --> 00:04:46,157
Airbags are deployed.

62
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:49,026
- All right, we're gonna have to get creative.
- Perfect time.

63
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:50,061
Not really.

64
00:05:01,637 --> 00:05:03,440
Oh, shit.

65
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:14,351
Drop your weapon.

66
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:17,153
Get on your knees.

67
00:05:17,187 --> 00:05:20,391
Hands on your head.
Put your weapon on the ground.

68
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,593
God damn it. Buckle up.

69
00:05:37,774 --> 00:05:40,076
Drop your fucking weapon
right now.

70
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,580
Get on your knees.
Put your hands on your head.

71
00:05:42,612 --> 00:05:44,115
She is a traitor.

72
00:05:46,115 --> 00:05:47,317
I'm the director
of the CIA.

73
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,086
This is a CIA operation.

74
00:05:50,521 --> 00:05:52,088
Back off and stand down!

75
00:05:52,122 --> 00:05:54,625
This is a matter
of national security.

76
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:56,227
Sir, drop your weapon.

77
00:05:57,293 --> 00:05:58,462
I warned you.

78
00:06:08,072 --> 00:06:10,240
<i>Godzbiv! What the hell
are you doing?</i>

79
00:06:10,274 --> 00:06:11,742
- <i>Are you crazy?</i>
- I'm handling it!

80
00:06:11,776 --> 00:06:15,646
<i>Just listen to me. Stop fighting.
Surrender and I will get you out.</i>

81
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:27,258
Godzbiv won't talk.

82
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,526
Well, we'll get him to talk.

83
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:31,495
Situation is critical.

84
00:06:31,528 --> 00:06:33,631
That's why I've already
given the data to China.

85
00:06:33,663 --> 00:06:36,266
The evacuation of the children
has already begun.

86
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,634
We're putting them
on a ship.

87
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:39,703
The plan is to take it
far out to sea

88
00:06:39,735 --> 00:06:42,339
and leave it there until the
bombs have been deactivated.

89
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,507
Regarding Mr. Z...

90
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,478
We detected a call on
Godzbiv's phone

91
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:51,249
from a fired agent by the
name of Gerry McKellen.

92
00:06:57,487 --> 00:07:01,358
Hi, Serpent. Hello, Director.

93
00:07:01,391 --> 00:07:02,760
<i>You know, you really
shouldn't have thrown me</i>

94
00:07:02,793 --> 00:07:03,927
<i>out of the CI
like piece of garbage.</i>

95
00:07:03,961 --> 00:07:07,230
But I guess that's not
really the point now, is it?

96
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:10,234
<i>You know that I know that you
sent troops to my place to get me.</i>

97
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:13,370
<i>But what you don't know is I rigged
that entire facility with bombs.</i>

98
00:07:13,403 --> 00:07:16,774
So unless you want the deaths of
all those people on your hands,

99
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:19,276
<i>I would suggest you tell them
to stay the fuck out of there.</i>

100
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:21,379
- Why are you doing this?
- I want power.

101
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:25,682
<i>I want absolute
fucking power.</i>

102
00:07:25,716 --> 00:07:30,588
There's no way for you to make this right.
Your career is finished.

103
00:07:33,357 --> 00:07:37,361
<i>Because you're an idiot
and a damn loser.</i>

104
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:40,398
Now get out of my sight!

105
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,269
No, in my office.

106
00:07:54,211 --> 00:07:57,648
- They're throwing me out on my ass.
- What happened?

107
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:01,886
I'll explain later.
Will you do me a favor, though,

108
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:03,553
and grab the flash drive
that's in my computer?

109
00:08:03,586 --> 00:08:05,688
That dipshit didn't even
give me a chance to pack up.

110
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:09,392
- I'll do it for you. I owe you after Brazil.
- Thank you.

111
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:13,764
Serp, if you... if you ever need
anything, you let me know.

112
00:08:13,797 --> 00:08:15,333
I got your back, okay?

113
00:08:39,355 --> 00:08:40,691
<i>How long
are we gonna do this?</i>

114
00:08:48,432 --> 00:08:52,336
How many times have I specifically
told you to follow directions?

115
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,970
Let me introduce myself.
Can we stop for a minute?

116
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,240
Time is on.

117
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:32,943
My name's Charles.
Here's my card.

118
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:36,746
Why did you speak
to the subject?

119
00:09:39,283 --> 00:09:40,418
Give me his card.

120
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:50,661
Hi, Robson. What's up?

121
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:53,764
Hey, I need a favor.

122
00:09:53,996 --> 00:09:55,466
Yes.

123
00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:59,003
So I'm getting married
in four days.

124
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:01,404
Congrats. And what do
you need of me, old chap?

125
00:10:02,938 --> 00:10:06,644
Godzbiv just hit me with a
last-minute rush assignment.

126
00:10:06,677 --> 00:10:09,279
It's, uh, security
for a convoy in China.

127
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:11,414
China, you say?

128
00:10:12,682 --> 00:10:17,020
Yeah. It's... I mean,
you just accompany

129
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:20,790
a couple of bio engineers and
nano technology scientists

130
00:10:20,823 --> 00:10:24,294
and once they arrive safely,
you come right back

131
00:10:24,327 --> 00:10:27,764
and it's access code three
since you passed your test.

132
00:10:29,865 --> 00:10:31,701
It's a no-brainer, right?

133
00:10:33,403 --> 00:10:34,937
Man, if everything
goes smoothly,

134
00:10:34,971 --> 00:10:37,008
I'm not even gonna make
it to my wedding on time.

135
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,611
Just please do this for me,
and I will owe you big time.

136
00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:48,786
To be honest, I don't have the
slightest wish to go to China.

137
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:52,656
But since you are asking me,
I'll do it.

138
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:57,360
Think of it as your
wedding present.

139
00:10:57,394 --> 00:10:59,096
You are the best.

140
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:03,533
- Who's handling the operation by the way?
- Pierce.

141
00:11:07,937 --> 00:11:11,442
Easy, easy, easy!
Be careful with that box, all right?

142
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:12,475
Make sure it's locked in.

143
00:11:16,746 --> 00:11:18,115
Be careful with
the equipment. Yo!

144
00:11:18,148 --> 00:11:20,518
- Make sure it's locked in, all right.
- Yes, sir.

145
00:11:43,005 --> 00:11:44,475
What the hell
you doing here?

146
00:11:44,508 --> 00:11:46,110
Robson was scheduled
for this convoy.

147
00:11:47,076 --> 00:11:49,546
Nice to see you too.

148
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:53,350
You know what? Screw this shit.
I'm calling Godzbiv.

149
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,828
Agent code Alpha Tango Bravo
one-two-niner, put the director on.

150
00:12:05,961 --> 00:12:08,064
Does it sound urgent?
Put him on.

151
00:12:11,768 --> 00:12:12,769
Yes.

152
00:12:12,802 --> 00:12:15,706
It's better to do the op
with someone like that.

153
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:19,543
You know what? He's got Mars' disease
or some shit like that, all right?

154
00:12:19,576 --> 00:12:21,846
He doesn't feel hot and cold in his hands.
And he sweats a lot.

155
00:12:22,546 --> 00:12:24,915
Oh, right.

156
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:27,550
There are five or six doctors in the
world that could do this surgery.

157
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,386
And they're all here,
right on this plane.

158
00:12:31,053 --> 00:12:33,756
Why the fuck am I explaining
this shit to you anyway?

159
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:36,659
Are you there?
Well, put the director on.

160
00:12:39,095 --> 00:12:41,031
Fine. Tell him
Pierce says hi.

161
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:50,006
Why the hell are you here?
Where's Robson?

162
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:52,075
I thought you were aware
of my new access level.

163
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,778
Shall we start
the operation?

164
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:59,048
This is exactly why I don't
want you on this convoy.

165
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,585
<i>Moving out.</i>

166
00:13:02,852 --> 00:13:04,053
What's the operation about?

167
00:13:06,255 --> 00:13:08,458
I don't know anything.
Can you explain?

168
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:11,428
Sure. We are
going to China.

169
00:13:14,563 --> 00:13:19,836
With Chinese doctors. And conducting
experiments on Chinese patients.

170
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:21,805
Fuck you.

171
00:13:35,784 --> 00:13:38,054
<i>We are arriving
at the target in seven hours.</i>

172
00:13:59,576 --> 00:14:00,577
I'll take care of it.

173
00:14:03,212 --> 00:14:07,283
Darling. Is everything
all right?

174
00:14:07,317 --> 00:14:09,986
- Why are you sitting in the dark?
- Everything's fine, honey.

175
00:14:37,647 --> 00:14:39,283
What?
The horrible disease is gone.

176
00:14:40,984 --> 00:14:42,252
The hands can feel
the cold.

177
00:14:42,285 --> 00:14:45,955
If I was you, I'd be thinking
about something else right now.

178
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:52,796
Like, when was the last time
you used a parachute?

179
00:14:52,828 --> 00:14:55,899
Are you joking?
Who packed it? You?

180
00:14:58,134 --> 00:14:59,135
I won't jump with it.

181
00:15:00,102 --> 00:15:03,339
- I don't trust you.
- You don't wanna jump?

182
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:07,311
Too bad, 'cause as soon as we hit that
Green Zone, we're all out the door.

183
00:15:12,148 --> 00:15:14,183
Take this, I'll take yours.

184
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:23,593
You think I'm gonna
kill you or something?

185
00:15:23,626 --> 00:15:26,697
What should I think
after you left me bleeding?

186
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,701
I left to get backup and we'd
both be dead if I didn't.

187
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:33,604
It was you who
violated protocol, not me.

188
00:15:36,105 --> 00:15:38,274
I packed this bag for Robson,
not you.

189
00:15:38,307 --> 00:15:39,909
So you got
nothing to worry about.

190
00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:44,881
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention?

191
00:15:44,913 --> 00:15:47,850
The flight out to the Green Zone
has gone perfectly.

192
00:15:47,884 --> 00:15:50,253
In a few minutes,
we will open the hatch.

193
00:15:50,285 --> 00:15:52,021
Now, you've all been
given sat navs.

194
00:15:52,054 --> 00:15:54,156
This will help you track
each other.

195
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,326
First thing we will do is
deploy the cargo,

196
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:58,762
and then all of you
will jump out after it.

197
00:15:58,794 --> 00:16:00,764
No, no, no, no, no.

198
00:16:02,298 --> 00:16:04,067
- What's up with him?
- Scared to jump.

199
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,869
I don't give a shit
if he's scared to jump or not.

200
00:16:05,902 --> 00:16:07,037
We reach the Green Zone,

201
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:11,642
- everyone is getting off this plane.
- No! I'm scared!

202
00:16:11,674 --> 00:16:13,776
Don't be afraid,
my little Chinese friend.

203
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:15,011
We will help you.

204
00:16:15,044 --> 00:16:17,347
- No!
- Pierce.

205
00:16:18,214 --> 00:16:20,217
No, no, no, no, no.

206
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,250
Give me a hand.

207
00:16:22,686 --> 00:16:24,687
No, no, no, no.

208
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,303
You're next!
We're ejecting!

209
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:50,346
<i>Target is down.</i>

210
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:03,393
Surgery takes one hour
and 40 minutes.

211
00:17:03,425 --> 00:17:05,327
Your job is to stall
at all costs,

212
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:07,330
to give enough time
for the operation.

213
00:17:07,363 --> 00:17:08,699
Use the staff entrance.

214
00:17:10,165 --> 00:17:13,069
This is where you'll set up
the surveillance cameras.

215
00:17:13,103 --> 00:17:16,339
You need to block this entrance
so no one comes from outside.

216
00:17:16,372 --> 00:17:19,843
If necessary,
eliminate any hostiles.

217
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,179
Are we going for kill shots or
are we just putting them down?

218
00:17:22,211 --> 00:17:25,715
Your call. Director's very
nervous about this operation.

219
00:17:25,749 --> 00:17:28,050
Have you ever seen him
not nervous?

220
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:30,287
In Brazil, when you left me
there bleeding,

221
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:32,121
he was also pretty
damn nervous.

222
00:17:32,154 --> 00:17:34,825
You knew the location and
what you were getting into.

223
00:17:34,857 --> 00:17:38,928
You left the covered zone.
Focus now, getting started.

224
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:57,167
We got a problem.
Go check it out.

225
00:20:00,636 --> 00:20:02,004
Let's go.

226
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:33,936
<i>Serpent, check status.</i>

227
00:20:36,204 --> 00:20:37,206
<i>Serpent!</i>

228
00:21:00,563 --> 00:21:01,632
Yes?

229
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:04,100
<i>All clear.</i>

230
00:21:05,468 --> 00:21:09,471
Uh, I need help removing
an unwanted package.

231
00:21:09,505 --> 00:21:12,342
- Is it a local carrier?
- No, an international.

232
00:21:13,442 --> 00:21:15,077
Seems we're not alone here.

233
00:21:15,111 --> 00:21:17,647
Operation starts
in two minutes.

234
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,317
<i>I need you here. Don't worry
about the dead guy.</i>

235
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:23,219
He ain't going nowhere.
Take care of it later.

236
00:21:33,462 --> 00:21:36,165
This seems to be
a maternity ward.

237
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:38,101
Newborns are having
a special chip installed

238
00:21:38,134 --> 00:21:42,404
to prolong their lives.
This operation will make history.

239
00:21:42,438 --> 00:21:46,243
The question is whether we'll have a
beautiful future or no future at all.

240
00:21:50,313 --> 00:21:53,717
They might not have known the outcome,
but they definitely knew the risks.

241
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,486
If a child dies or becomes
handicapped after the operation,

242
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:58,955
the agency will make up
the damage to the parents.

243
00:22:01,523 --> 00:22:03,425
Pierce, we took
the clinic by force

244
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:06,528
and neutralized
everybody here.

245
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:09,498
You will delete all the footage
from the surveillance cameras.

246
00:22:09,531 --> 00:22:12,234
Why would anyone ever know
we were here?

247
00:22:12,268 --> 00:22:15,471
Just relax and do your job,
that's all.

248
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,112
What happened in Brazil?

249
00:22:24,413 --> 00:22:25,682
I was doing my job.

250
00:22:27,282 --> 00:22:28,651
What were you doing there?

251
00:22:33,122 --> 00:22:34,224
We've got a guest.

252
00:22:39,261 --> 00:22:40,629
It's a cat.

253
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:42,298
She's trying to get in.

254
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,134
Get rid of her.

255
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,601
Is that her
yelling so loud?

256
00:22:45,634 --> 00:22:47,170
Shoot the bitch.

257
00:22:47,202 --> 00:22:48,637
I'm not going
to shoot a cat.

258
00:22:48,671 --> 00:22:50,539
You don't shut her up,
I will.

259
00:22:51,173 --> 00:22:52,308
No. Whoa.

260
00:22:54,544 --> 00:22:55,545
I got it.

261
00:23:01,116 --> 00:23:03,720
Fuckin' cat.
She's hiding behind a tree.

262
00:23:03,752 --> 00:23:05,588
Let's scare her off
with a gas grenade.

263
00:23:06,655 --> 00:23:08,424
A grenade.

264
00:23:10,192 --> 00:23:11,260
I got it.

265
00:23:57,205 --> 00:23:58,541
<i>Where the hell is this bitch?</i>

266
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:01,545
<i>Can you see her?</i>

267
00:24:04,913 --> 00:24:07,483
Call the air force.
The situation is out of control.

268
00:24:07,517 --> 00:24:08,518
Where is she?

269
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:10,552
Pierce, you're being louder
than the damn cat.

270
00:24:10,586 --> 00:24:13,222
<i>Maybe it would be
better to shoot you down.</i>

271
00:24:13,256 --> 00:24:15,192
You're on the cat's
fucking side!

272
00:24:28,904 --> 00:24:30,139
What?

273
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:32,842
What?

274
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,676
What's with
the hazmat suits?

275
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,847
Haz... Why the hell did
you go in there?

276
00:24:38,881 --> 00:24:41,184
It's none
of your fucking business.

277
00:24:41,217 --> 00:24:43,686
I'll give my own report
to the head of the CIA

278
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:45,522
as soon as I get back.

279
00:24:45,555 --> 00:24:46,890
And I'll mention
the guest.

280
00:24:48,223 --> 00:24:49,225
Who I had
to get rid of.

281
00:24:50,326 --> 00:24:52,261
I don't give a shit.

282
00:24:52,295 --> 00:24:54,397
Report what
the fuck you want.

283
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,465
We have to come
back anyway.

284
00:24:55,498 --> 00:24:59,369
The damn cat woke up
the whole fucking district.

285
00:24:59,402 --> 00:25:01,371
Did you check if the dead
Asian had any documents on him?

286
00:25:01,403 --> 00:25:02,705
Of course I did.

287
00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:05,642
An American citizen walking
around in China without documents

288
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:08,644
but with a 12-caliber gun
and an arsenal of explosives.

289
00:25:11,614 --> 00:25:13,482
Something is very wrong here.

290
00:25:13,516 --> 00:25:15,185
Yes, something
is very wrong here.

291
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:22,759
Director.

292
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:27,196
<i>Do you even understand that your
life depends on this operation?</i>

293
00:25:33,635 --> 00:25:35,337
I do.

294
00:25:35,371 --> 00:25:37,908
I need your full
concentration on this.

295
00:25:39,142 --> 00:25:43,813
One call to the press and I
will destroy you for life.

296
00:25:58,594 --> 00:26:00,797
Where's Dr. Lee?
What, did he just disappear?

297
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:02,664
I'm leaving with the other
doctors, all right?

298
00:26:02,698 --> 00:26:05,001
We have exactly seven minutes
before we have to evacuate.

299
00:26:05,034 --> 00:26:08,371
You stay and find Lee and take
the next plane out. You got it?

300
00:26:08,403 --> 00:26:09,405
Let's go.

301
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,950
Dr. Lee, come with me.
We don't have time.

302
00:26:20,982 --> 00:26:22,586
Here, you need this.

303
00:26:59,488 --> 00:27:00,789
Lieutenant!

304
00:27:00,823 --> 00:27:02,625
The subject took off.

305
00:27:02,657 --> 00:27:03,892
Can we swing back?

306
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,961
It's not worth the risk.

307
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:19,041
I have guests,

308
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:21,911
Agents from the Department
of Internal Investigations.

309
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,517
You say nothing
about the operation in China.

310
00:27:29,117 --> 00:27:30,552
Do you hear me?

311
00:27:30,586 --> 00:27:33,390
Pierce? In my office
in 10 minutes.

312
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:35,991
You hear me?

313
00:27:36,726 --> 00:27:37,794
Nothing.

314
00:27:38,493 --> 00:27:40,562
Go to the
interrogation room.

315
00:27:41,763 --> 00:27:43,465
Since when
are you in charge?

316
00:27:43,898 --> 00:27:45,467
The op is over.

317
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,802
They're waiting for you.

318
00:27:51,707 --> 00:27:53,777
Agent Kavsky.
Follow me.

319
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:26,442
So when was the last time
you saw Agent Robson?

320
00:28:26,474 --> 00:28:28,477
I saw him three days ago
in the office.

321
00:28:28,943 --> 00:28:29,945
Why?

322
00:28:33,082 --> 00:28:34,351
What happened?

323
00:28:36,085 --> 00:28:37,553
Agent Robson
was murdered.

324
00:28:37,586 --> 00:28:40,088
Shot in the head
at point-blank range.

325
00:28:40,122 --> 00:28:42,525
We dusted for prints,
but we found nothing yet.

326
00:28:44,894 --> 00:28:46,128
Who is in charge
of this case?

327
00:28:50,165 --> 00:28:52,034
Who is running
the investigation?

328
00:28:56,939 --> 00:28:58,541
Captain Johnson Bigles.

329
00:28:58,574 --> 00:28:59,976
I have to go.

330
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:02,478
Oi, I'm not done
with you yet.

331
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,847
Am I under order
from Director Godzbiv?

332
00:29:05,948 --> 00:29:06,983
No.

333
00:29:07,016 --> 00:29:09,819
I told you everything
I know.

334
00:29:09,852 --> 00:29:11,821
I'll let you know
if I remember anything else.

335
00:29:14,656 --> 00:29:15,924
Okay, Agent Ford?

336
00:29:28,671 --> 00:29:29,772
Captain Bigles.

337
00:29:29,805 --> 00:29:30,940
I'm Lucinda Kavsky.

338
00:29:30,972 --> 00:29:32,607
I worked with
Agent Robson Walker.

339
00:29:32,641 --> 00:29:34,110
And I have some
information for you.

340
00:29:34,143 --> 00:29:35,412
Okay. Follow me.

341
00:29:47,189 --> 00:29:50,026
Director, we have a problem.

342
00:29:57,165 --> 00:30:00,602
I went to China
instead of Robson as a favor.

343
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:03,172
He was supposed
to get married tomorrow.

344
00:30:03,204 --> 00:30:05,774
All right, so tell me
about this op in China.

345
00:30:06,674 --> 00:30:08,911
She's sending everything
to Bigles from IA.

346
00:30:08,943 --> 00:30:10,980
Well, work it out
with him.

347
00:30:11,012 --> 00:30:15,550
All right, if you were on the op
then you have an ironclad alibi,

348
00:30:15,584 --> 00:30:17,720
but who would
want to kill him?

349
00:30:17,752 --> 00:30:19,120
Expose her.

350
00:30:19,153 --> 00:30:20,890
<i>She's nothing but trouble.</i>

351
00:30:24,192 --> 00:30:25,194
You have any ideas?

352
00:30:26,161 --> 00:30:27,529
No clue.

353
00:30:27,563 --> 00:30:29,131
And you make sure
and bury her.

354
00:30:29,163 --> 00:30:30,165
Yes, sir.

355
00:30:34,737 --> 00:30:35,839
Thank you.

356
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:54,022
Can I help you?

357
00:32:17,873 --> 00:32:18,942
What a day.

358
00:32:36,057 --> 00:32:37,059
Lucinda Kavsky!

359
00:32:38,794 --> 00:32:39,996
Lucinda Kavsky!

360
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,969
You're under arrest
for the murder of Agent Robson.

361
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:48,937
I advise you not to resist.

362
00:32:48,971 --> 00:32:50,405
Why break down the door?

363
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:51,975
Couldn't you just
ring the bell?

364
00:32:54,143 --> 00:32:55,644
Get her out of here.

365
00:33:02,884 --> 00:33:05,221
Make sure you find
that damn flash drive.

366
00:33:05,887 --> 00:33:06,955
Yes, sir.

367
00:33:36,818 --> 00:33:41,856
I don't have a lot of time,
Serpent. They're coming for me.

368
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:44,126
<i>I'm going to tell you everything
I know about the operation.</i>

369
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,661
<i>So listen closely.</i>

370
00:33:45,693 --> 00:33:52,300
<i>First, Director Godzbiv is being
controlled by a man known as Mr. Z.</i>

371
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:55,137
<i>Nobody knows his real name.</i>

372
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,673
<i>What I do know is that
he's incredibly powerful.</i>

373
00:33:59,108 --> 00:34:01,711
<i>And Godzbiv is under
his complete control.</i>

374
00:34:04,146 --> 00:34:07,250
<i>I don't know how far
his influence goes.</i>

375
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:09,719
<i>But you must trust no one.</i>

376
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:16,025
To the wall.
Hands up behind your head.

377
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,088
After all this time.

378
00:34:48,222 --> 00:34:50,159
I thought you'd completely
forgot about me.

379
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:53,028
No, I didn't.

380
00:34:53,061 --> 00:34:56,265
Five years is not a long time
compared to what awaits you here.

381
00:34:56,297 --> 00:34:58,366
Sounds promising.

382
00:35:00,168 --> 00:35:01,237
What's this?

383
00:35:03,304 --> 00:35:04,773
<i>Chess Strategies.</i>

384
00:35:09,878 --> 00:35:11,947
It might be
a worthwhile read.

385
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,916
The chess game
is still ahead of you.

386
00:35:16,318 --> 00:35:18,153
I can't go through
with this, Serpent.

387
00:35:19,554 --> 00:35:20,856
I thought I could,

388
00:35:21,856 --> 00:35:22,925
but I can't.

389
00:35:29,063 --> 00:35:32,434
There can be no loose ends
on our side, Serpent.

390
00:35:33,268 --> 00:35:35,503
That's why everyone we know
is dead.

391
00:35:35,536 --> 00:35:37,305
<i>All the operating
doctors are dead.</i>

392
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:43,145
The only ones alive
are you and me.

393
00:35:58,193 --> 00:35:59,195
<i>I need your help.</i>

394
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:02,431
You're the only person
I trust.

395
00:36:06,101 --> 00:36:07,103
Guard!

396
00:36:09,338 --> 00:36:10,406
Guard!

397
00:36:13,208 --> 00:36:15,878
She's not breathing.

398
00:36:16,577 --> 00:36:18,380
Call the ambulance!

399
00:36:57,385 --> 00:36:59,288
<i>God damn you, Pierce.</i>

400
00:39:16,257 --> 00:39:18,159
<i>Gerry,
I need the address of Avy Su.</i>

401
00:39:18,193 --> 00:39:21,063
- <i>Born April 14th. She's...</i>
- Hold on, I'm looking.

402
00:39:21,096 --> 00:39:24,333
And, Serpent, thanks for holding
on to that flash drive for me.

403
00:39:24,365 --> 00:39:25,367
Sure.

404
00:39:27,702 --> 00:39:31,240
I found her.
She's in the Shandong province.

405
00:39:31,273 --> 00:39:32,641
<i>Looks like it's a landline.</i>

406
00:39:32,673 --> 00:39:34,143
Put me through
a secure connection.

407
00:39:34,175 --> 00:39:35,376
Are you gonna talk to her?

408
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:36,478
Do you speak Chinese?

409
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,413
No. Nope.

410
00:39:38,447 --> 00:39:40,516
Definitely don't speak Chinese.
All right, stand by.

411
00:39:40,548 --> 00:39:42,384
And connected.

412
00:40:21,556 --> 00:40:23,724
- She's here.
- Here in New York?

413
00:40:23,757 --> 00:40:25,393
Can you find out
where they're staying?

414
00:40:25,427 --> 00:40:26,762
<i>Oh, look at that.</i>

415
00:40:26,795 --> 00:40:29,697
The Waldorf Astoria
on the famed Park Avenue.

416
00:40:29,731 --> 00:40:32,268
<i>Looks like they're checked in
for four days.</i>

417
00:41:42,204 --> 00:41:44,440
Gerry, I've prepared
a present.

418
00:41:45,306 --> 00:41:46,942
Avy is being followed.

419
00:41:46,974 --> 00:41:48,876
I want to get rid
of this tail.

420
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:50,411
At least buy us
some time for a while.

421
00:41:50,445 --> 00:41:53,215
Okay,
but whatever you do,

422
00:41:53,248 --> 00:41:54,650
don't draw any more attention
to yourself.

423
00:41:54,682 --> 00:41:56,351
That's almost impossible.

424
00:41:56,384 --> 00:41:58,820
Right Just stay away
from the taxi, okay?

425
00:41:58,853 --> 00:42:00,389
Don't worry. I will.

426
00:43:27,876 --> 00:43:28,944
<i>Room's clear.</i>

427
00:43:53,735 --> 00:43:54,670
Hello, Avy.

428
00:43:54,702 --> 00:43:57,972
I'm Lucinda.
I'm a friend of your parents.

429
00:43:58,005 --> 00:43:59,940
Do you want to
come play with me?

430
00:43:59,974 --> 00:44:03,445
Let's go. Mom and Dad
are with Aunt Sine.

431
00:44:03,811 --> 00:44:05,313
I know.

432
00:44:05,347 --> 00:44:07,816
Can we pretend to be cats
and get out of here?

433
00:44:07,849 --> 00:44:09,952
- Yes, like cats.
- Yes.

434
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:11,487
Let's go.

435
00:44:30,938 --> 00:44:32,907
Hold on tight
and don't let go.

436
00:44:47,755 --> 00:44:48,856
Avy.

437
00:44:50,724 --> 00:44:52,094
Avy, jump.

438
00:44:53,795 --> 00:44:54,896
Jump.

439
00:44:56,965 --> 00:44:59,568
Avy, jump. Jump!

440
00:45:07,608 --> 00:45:08,976
I promise I'll catch you.

441
00:45:29,864 --> 00:45:33,568
Here you are, madam.
Your tickets and keys.

442
00:45:33,601 --> 00:45:34,603
Thank you.

443
00:45:48,682 --> 00:45:51,987
There she is. Send it to the
idiots so they know what she looks like.

444
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:10,506
Now we're going to play
another game.

445
00:46:43,737 --> 00:46:47,007
This girl, you're sure
you didn't see her?

446
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:51,646
It's this one. You're sure
you didn't see her come through?

447
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:54,215
I'm not sure.
I don't remember her.

448
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:56,151
Sorry.

449
00:46:59,621 --> 00:47:00,655
Thank you.

450
00:47:49,003 --> 00:47:50,972
<i>We found
the chip. Closing in.</i>

451
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,880
Do you like
your new look?

452
00:48:11,793 --> 00:48:13,929
<i>Split up.
I'll cut 'em off.</i>

453
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:18,065
They're fast, I must admit.

454
00:48:24,606 --> 00:48:26,808
Avy, close your eyes
and cover your ears.

455
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:38,319
<i>Do not open fire.
We can't hit the girl.</i>

456
00:48:58,873 --> 00:49:00,842
<i>Stop the vehicle.</i>

457
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,000
Are you okay?
Are you all right?

458
00:49:25,032 --> 00:49:27,603
We've got to get
out of here, fast.

459
00:49:58,865 --> 00:50:00,402
Don't be afraid.

460
00:50:00,434 --> 00:50:01,969
Remember, we're cats.

461
00:50:02,003 --> 00:50:04,271
Cats are afraid of nothing.

462
00:50:04,304 --> 00:50:05,973
I wanna go home.

463
00:50:06,007 --> 00:50:08,644
I know, babe. Soon.

464
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,204
Hey!

465
00:52:04,525 --> 00:52:06,260
- Gerry, I need you.
- All right.

466
00:52:06,293 --> 00:52:08,362
<i>I need
the address of Borden Aaker.</i>

467
00:52:08,396 --> 00:52:10,164
He's got a private
clinic just outside the city.

468
00:52:10,197 --> 00:52:13,400
I'm sending you the address
to your GPS, now.

469
00:52:22,175 --> 00:52:24,945
- One more favor, please.
- Yeah, why am I not surprised?

470
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:27,548
<i>I'm assuming Avy
has a tracking chip in her.</i>

471
00:52:27,581 --> 00:52:30,884
- Any advice?
- Turn on the radio suppressor on your tablet.

472
00:52:30,918 --> 00:52:34,122
- It'll cut out communication within a three-mile radius.
- Thanks, Gerry.

473
00:52:34,155 --> 00:52:35,857
I'll check
with you later.

474
00:52:43,898 --> 00:52:45,867
I want my mommy.

475
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,568
I want to go home.

476
00:52:47,601 --> 00:52:49,971
I don't want
to play anymore.

477
00:53:01,548 --> 00:53:03,585
<i>Listen, Godzbiv,</i>

478
00:53:03,617 --> 00:53:05,586
<i>do you not understand
the consequences here?</i>

479
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:08,856
<i>How did she even cross the ocean?
How did she get through customs?</i>

480
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:11,259
- <i>It shouldn't have happened.</i>
- Where is she now?

481
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:13,327
- She's disappeared.
- <i>Find them.</i>

482
00:53:20,101 --> 00:53:21,436
- Hi, Aaker.
- As always

483
00:53:21,469 --> 00:53:23,171
with you,
there's a crisis, right?

484
00:53:23,204 --> 00:53:25,173
This time you don't need
to reassemble me.

485
00:53:25,206 --> 00:53:28,009
We have
another situation, entirely.

486
00:53:38,152 --> 00:53:39,487
Status update.

487
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:43,592
Sir, three agents are dead,
two wounded, and we lost three cars.

488
00:53:46,092 --> 00:53:49,129
I wanna go home.

489
00:53:49,163 --> 00:53:54,034
I know, baby, but first, Dr. Aaker is
going to check and make sure you're okay.

490
00:53:54,068 --> 00:53:55,070
Okay.

491
00:53:56,304 --> 00:53:59,139
<i>Use as many
additional forces as you can.</i>

492
00:53:59,172 --> 00:54:02,075
Call in all reserves,
and find the girl.

493
00:54:02,108 --> 00:54:03,210
Copy that.

494
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:06,146
All right, let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

495
00:54:13,387 --> 00:54:16,925
Don't pay attention to the mess,
I'm still in the middle of renovations.

496
00:54:17,724 --> 00:54:19,159
Clinic's not open yet.

497
00:54:24,231 --> 00:54:27,602
They're gone from the radar
and out of the reach of the satellite.

498
00:54:27,635 --> 00:54:29,905
They most likely disabled
the tracking system.

499
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:36,411
Don't let the mess fool you, I have anything
and everything I need to help you here.

500
00:54:36,443 --> 00:54:37,512
Yeah.

501
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:48,355
What's up,
my brave, little girl?

502
00:54:54,195 --> 00:54:55,497
I need to tell
you something.

503
00:55:00,568 --> 00:55:03,638
They disappeared somewhere in the
circle, ask the chopper

504
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:06,674
to give me pictures here,
here and here.

505
00:55:11,746 --> 00:55:14,449
I've never seen anything
like this before. I can't believe

506
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:16,617
she's still alive
with that thing in her head.

507
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:19,119
Now you understand
why we're here.

508
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:26,193
This is some seriously
advanced nano-technology.

509
00:55:26,226 --> 00:55:29,129
Essentially, this would
be making her a nuclear weapon,

510
00:55:29,163 --> 00:55:31,065
biological, ticking time-bomb.

511
00:55:38,706 --> 00:55:41,476
There's a huge risk she'll die
if I try to remove the device.

512
00:55:42,543 --> 00:55:46,114
If you don't, she'll die,
for sure.

513
00:55:46,146 --> 00:55:49,250
Why should I do it? I'll lose my
license and spend my life in prison.

514
00:55:49,282 --> 00:55:51,353
- This is suicide.
- You're alone in this clinic.

515
00:55:52,152 --> 00:55:53,355
Except for us, yes?

516
00:55:56,090 --> 00:56:00,161
Then it's simple.
You'll do the operation,

517
00:56:00,193 --> 00:56:03,130
or you'll do the operation
with my gun to your head.

518
00:56:03,164 --> 00:56:06,367
- You're threatening me?
- Don't make me use force.

519
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,568
Just get this thing
out of her head.

520
00:56:08,601 --> 00:56:10,605
We don't know what
we're dealing with here.

521
00:56:10,637 --> 00:56:12,172
I shouldn't even touch her.

522
00:56:12,206 --> 00:56:14,275
I can't complete an operation
like this alone.

523
00:56:14,307 --> 00:56:17,210
- I'll assist you.
- I need assistance with medical experience.

524
00:56:17,244 --> 00:56:20,382
- You know what I'm capable of.
- You're just good with a gun.

525
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:24,318
We don't have time
for any of this.

526
00:56:26,286 --> 00:56:28,389
We'll have to make do
with what we have, Doc.

527
00:56:32,726 --> 00:56:33,728
Let's go.

528
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:38,266
<i>Do we have
satellite data available?</i>

529
00:56:38,298 --> 00:56:41,168
<i>They're gone from the radar
and out of the reach of the satellite.</i>

530
00:56:41,202 --> 00:56:43,471
They most likely disabled
the tracking system.

531
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,643
Clamp.

532
00:56:49,677 --> 00:56:52,146
The signal is back,
We're right next to her.

533
00:56:52,179 --> 00:56:53,213
What?

534
00:56:54,181 --> 00:56:56,751
Get ready, we're going
to take the building.

535
00:56:58,552 --> 00:57:01,789
Doctor, you're going
to finish without me.

536
00:57:01,822 --> 00:57:04,291
- This is so typical.
- Let me know when it's completed.

537
00:59:14,755 --> 00:59:18,393
Shots are coming
from the nearby building. Fire.

538
00:59:56,297 --> 00:59:57,432
The fuck!

539
01:00:08,809 --> 01:00:11,412
Get in the building
and find the girl.

540
01:01:21,481 --> 01:01:23,918
So, what now?
You're gonna blow up my clinic?

541
01:01:23,951 --> 01:01:26,119
That's the thanks I get?

542
01:01:26,152 --> 01:01:28,855
You're the one who said
I was good with a gun.

543
01:01:28,889 --> 01:01:32,827
The operation was successful,
I have the chip in my hand.

544
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,496
- How's Avy?
- We have to wait until she wakes up.

545
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:55,048
In a minute, I'll be upstairs, to pick
up the chip, you and Avy will be fine.

546
01:01:56,784 --> 01:01:57,919
But I have to leave.

547
01:02:41,961 --> 01:02:43,530
Thank you.

548
01:02:45,132 --> 01:02:49,070
- Lucinda, take care.
- You too.

549
01:03:00,481 --> 01:03:01,916
Hands up. On the floor.

550
01:03:10,923 --> 01:03:13,027
<i>All right. All right.
All right. Where are you?</i>

551
01:03:13,059 --> 01:03:14,161
Somewhere under
New York City.

552
01:03:14,195 --> 01:03:17,530
- Okay, do you have the chip?
- I do, there's some code.

553
01:03:17,563 --> 01:03:20,934
- I want to know what it means.
- <i>You have to get it to me as soon as possible.</i>

554
01:03:20,967 --> 01:03:24,672
I can't tell you who made it until I can
actually have a chance to look at it.

555
01:03:24,704 --> 01:03:26,673
All right, let's see.
You're coming up on the radar now.

556
01:03:26,706 --> 01:03:29,943
You're at
57th and Broadway.

557
01:03:29,976 --> 01:03:32,745
<i>Get there and send me everything
you can to this address.</i>

558
01:03:32,778 --> 01:03:35,949
- What would I do without you?
- <i>Yeah. No shit.</i>

559
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:42,123
- <i>Gerry.</i>
- Wait a, wait a, wait a minute.

560
01:03:43,789 --> 01:03:46,226
Holy shit. There's all kinds
of classified data here.

561
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,662
<i>Looks like the work
of Verta Corporation?</i>

562
01:03:48,695 --> 01:03:52,066
<i>They do nuclear physics
and bio research.</i>

563
01:03:52,099 --> 01:03:55,669
<i>Let's see, the program was financed by,
oh, great... the Department of Defense.</i>

564
01:03:55,702 --> 01:03:58,272
<i>Big money there.
So, that's cool.</i>

565
01:03:58,304 --> 01:04:03,543
The authors are a Zagreb Duansky,
Michael Bonn and Rhuar Nour.

566
01:04:03,577 --> 01:04:07,248
I sent you their personnel files now.
The program was closed five years ago.

567
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,983
<i>These guys
are sociopaths.</i>

568
01:04:09,016 --> 01:04:11,652
<i>They used to do experiments
on women and children.</i>

569
01:04:11,684 --> 01:04:15,655
I hope you're ready to sort this one
out, kid. Oh, hey, one more thing.

570
01:04:15,688 --> 01:04:18,057
<i>Did you see you had a
message from Pierce?</i>

571
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:19,993
Why wouldn't he contact
me directly?

572
01:04:21,228 --> 01:04:22,563
<i>Look at the video.</i>

573
01:04:23,297 --> 01:04:24,532
<i>Pierce is gone.</i>

574
01:04:32,139 --> 01:04:33,240
Talk later, Gerry.

575
01:04:43,317 --> 01:04:44,518
<i>Now
about the operation.</i>

576
01:04:44,552 --> 01:04:48,021
<i>We helped create what was
being called "bio bombs."</i>

577
01:04:48,054 --> 01:04:51,925
<i>Human weapons. Make an atomic
bomb look like child's play.</i>

578
01:04:54,061 --> 01:04:57,298
<i>They've chosen children
as their hosts.</i>

579
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,284
<i>I don't have a lot of time,
Serpent. They're coming for me.</i>

580
01:05:50,317 --> 01:05:51,652
<i>So, listen closely.</i>

581
01:05:54,121 --> 01:05:57,391
<i>What we do know,
it will be somewhere in Southeast Asia.</i>

582
01:05:57,423 --> 01:05:59,659
<i>Four kids.</i>

583
01:05:59,693 --> 01:06:03,798
<i>Four bombs.
Four secrets.</i>

584
01:06:05,065 --> 01:06:08,668
<i>It will be strategically
located through tour agencies.</i>

585
01:06:10,704 --> 01:06:12,006
<i>And then the button
gets pushed.</i>

586
01:06:13,072 --> 01:06:14,608
<i>The question is why?</i>

587
01:06:15,775 --> 01:06:17,944
<i>I think that a disaster
this big</i>

588
01:06:17,978 --> 01:06:21,148
<i>will take the attention
off the internal issues.</i>

589
01:06:21,181 --> 01:06:25,052
<i>There can be no loose ends
on our side, Serpent.</i>

590
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:34,862
<i>The only ones alive
are you...</i>

591
01:06:35,262 --> 01:06:37,398
<i>and me.</i>

592
01:06:37,431 --> 01:06:39,233
<i>We can't go through
with this, Serpent.</i>

593
01:06:40,867 --> 01:06:43,838
<i>I thought I could,
but I can't.</i>

594
01:07:17,471 --> 01:07:19,005
Boss. Boss!

595
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:34,255
<i>I've developed a plan
to neutralize the bombs.</i>

596
01:07:36,021 --> 01:07:37,123
<i>I need your help.</i>

597
01:07:38,157 --> 01:07:39,926
<i>You're the only
person I trust.</i>

598
01:09:10,417 --> 01:09:12,086
I'll pay if you're
nice to me.

599
01:09:23,195 --> 01:09:24,931
What is your name?

600
01:09:24,965 --> 01:09:26,167
And what do you do?

601
01:09:28,234 --> 01:09:29,569
Well, you want to talk.

602
01:09:33,907 --> 01:09:38,545
I have spent my life
helping to

603
01:09:38,578 --> 01:09:43,115
weed out the population,
the biological garbage.

604
01:09:43,149 --> 01:09:48,289
Sick and ugly
kids, gimps, psychos.

605
01:09:49,421 --> 01:09:50,824
Wild animals.

606
01:09:53,426 --> 01:09:55,229
I sanitize society.

607
01:09:57,596 --> 01:09:59,032
I'm a wolf.

608
01:10:05,372 --> 01:10:07,208
People shouldn't be ugly.

609
01:10:09,442 --> 01:10:11,177
You should be beautiful.

610
01:10:12,177 --> 01:10:13,581
That's my motto.

611
01:10:19,485 --> 01:10:21,087
How do you fit
into your motto?

612
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,056
Having a belly
like that.

613
01:10:24,356 --> 01:10:26,126
You're a bit
of a porker.

614
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:28,095
What did you say?

615
01:10:29,162 --> 01:10:31,966
Because I am
the upper crust.

616
01:10:44,377 --> 01:10:46,580
Lucinda Kavsky,

617
01:10:46,613 --> 01:10:48,414
I'm Professor Archer.

618
01:10:49,481 --> 01:10:52,051
We studied your test,

619
01:10:52,085 --> 01:10:55,655
and we'd like to
offer you a job.

620
01:11:00,592 --> 01:11:01,595
Hello?

621
01:11:02,561 --> 01:11:05,164
Ang, are you
listening to me?

622
01:11:05,198 --> 01:11:06,600
Dad comes to pick me
up today.

623
01:11:06,632 --> 01:11:07,634
You're coming over.

624
01:11:07,667 --> 01:11:09,368
I promised to show you
our new pool, remember?

625
01:11:09,402 --> 01:11:10,537
- Oh, here's Dad.
- Mmm-hmm.

626
01:11:15,007 --> 01:11:16,542
Daddy, can Angie
stay over tonight?

627
01:11:21,014 --> 01:11:22,114
I don't mind.

628
01:11:22,148 --> 01:11:24,018
Nice to meet you.
I'm Rhuar.

629
01:11:59,485 --> 01:12:01,054
What do we have?

630
01:12:01,087 --> 01:12:04,257
Not a thing. Neck was snapped.

631
01:12:04,289 --> 01:12:06,292
Looks like a professional job.
Nobody knows a thing.

632
01:12:08,127 --> 01:12:09,328
What about the camera?

633
01:12:09,362 --> 01:12:11,064
Yeah, not in this zone.

634
01:12:11,096 --> 01:12:12,565
We're checking with
all the guests now, though.

635
01:12:12,599 --> 01:12:13,734
Give me his ID.

636
01:12:13,766 --> 01:12:15,568
I'm gonna check it out
in the database.

637
01:12:20,707 --> 01:12:22,142
Your fly's undone.

638
01:12:29,615 --> 01:12:31,251
So what are you studying?

639
01:12:31,283 --> 01:12:33,052
I would like
to become a lawyer.

640
01:12:33,086 --> 01:12:34,320
Perfect choice.

641
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:36,088
I say the same to Vita,

642
01:12:36,122 --> 01:12:39,793
but she has not chosen a
serious profession. Designer.

643
01:12:39,826 --> 01:12:41,761
A lawyer makes
much more money.

644
01:12:41,795 --> 01:12:43,262
Dad, please.

645
01:12:43,296 --> 01:12:44,798
I'm just following my heart.

646
01:12:44,831 --> 01:12:47,034
All right, fine.
As you wish, my dear.

647
01:12:47,501 --> 01:12:48,668
Let's go, Nick.

648
01:13:01,581 --> 01:13:05,752
Zach Ribdownski,
ex-personnel,

649
01:13:05,784 --> 01:13:09,155
with the Pentagon,
graduated military bioengineering.

650
01:13:09,689 --> 01:13:11,257
Yeah.

651
01:13:11,291 --> 01:13:14,194
We found something pretty interesting.
I think you're gonna want to see this.

652
01:13:16,762 --> 01:13:19,065
Ex personnel at the Pentagon
doesn't exist.

653
01:13:56,469 --> 01:13:57,871
And what do you do,
Mr. Nour?

654
01:13:57,904 --> 01:13:59,706
Nuclear physics.

655
01:13:59,738 --> 01:14:01,107
Atomic bombs. Wow!

656
01:14:01,408 --> 01:14:02,509
Cool.

657
01:14:07,346 --> 01:14:08,748
And where is your wife?

658
01:14:10,382 --> 01:14:13,787
- She's away in India.
- Don't you...

659
01:14:14,287 --> 01:14:15,823
get lonely at night?

660
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:28,402
We should go.
We have a lot of homework to do.

661
01:14:49,889 --> 01:14:51,925
All right, just don't kill
him too early,

662
01:14:51,957 --> 01:14:54,226
<i>or we're never gonna be able
to deactivate the damn chip.</i>

663
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:57,297
- I got it.
- <i>Just make sure you keep him talking.</i>

664
01:14:57,329 --> 01:14:58,899
<i>We need his voice
to crack the password.</i>

665
01:15:15,782 --> 01:15:17,251
I was waiting for you.

666
01:15:17,917 --> 01:15:19,286
Come to me.

667
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:33,900
Wow, such a skilled girl.

668
01:15:35,935 --> 01:15:37,471
Advanced youth.

669
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:43,176
Put your hands up.

670
01:15:52,784 --> 01:15:54,453
Would you like to
keep me here?

671
01:15:55,587 --> 01:15:57,890
Yes, I would never
let you go.

672
01:15:59,292 --> 01:16:01,762
And what
would be the passcode?

673
01:16:02,595 --> 01:16:04,731
E equals MC squared.

674
01:16:06,899 --> 01:16:10,804
No, wait,
let me be creative.

675
01:16:12,971 --> 01:16:15,574
This is not a defeat.

676
01:16:15,608 --> 01:16:17,844
<i>No surrender or failure.</i>

677
01:16:19,578 --> 01:16:21,947
It is a simple attack.

678
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:26,385
The king is in check,
to be especially protected,

679
01:16:26,418 --> 01:16:29,322
that's the part
he must play.

680
01:16:29,354 --> 01:16:30,623
For he is the king.

681
01:16:31,923 --> 01:16:33,993
You won't find him
in a church,

682
01:16:34,027 --> 01:16:37,364
and he is not
as tall indeed.

683
01:16:37,396 --> 01:16:40,367
But, the name of the
piece is the same.

684
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:41,667
<i>Bishop.</i>

685
01:16:44,069 --> 01:16:47,873
He may clatter
over other pawns,

686
01:16:47,907 --> 01:16:51,444
and other pieces,
for he is the knight.

687
01:16:52,645 --> 01:16:55,882
There is a famous rule.
You cannot take

688
01:16:56,515 --> 01:16:57,983
<i>the king.</i>

689
01:16:58,016 --> 01:17:01,688
You can freely
instead take and kill...

690
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:04,323
- <i>Yeah! I got it.</i>
- ...the queen.

691
01:17:04,356 --> 01:17:06,326
Nicely done.
You were fucking amazing.

692
01:17:22,942 --> 01:17:25,846
<i>I want absolute
fucking power.</i>

693
01:17:26,779 --> 01:17:28,448
And I have that now.

694
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,018
<i>One squeeze and
a billion people die.</i>

695
01:17:36,889 --> 01:17:39,926
I did all his dirty work
on the ground over there.

696
01:17:39,958 --> 01:17:43,963
I thought he was helping me,
and the whole time he was using me.

697
01:17:47,533 --> 01:17:48,702
Don't blame
yourself, Lucinda.

698
01:17:48,734 --> 01:17:50,703
It's a tricky game
that we play.

699
01:17:50,737 --> 01:17:53,440
Hey, you just got taken.

700
01:17:54,373 --> 01:17:55,942
Don't let it happen again.

701
01:17:55,975 --> 01:17:58,912
Maybe there's still something...
something I can do.

702
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,349
He likes me.
He likes the game.

703
01:18:04,951 --> 01:18:06,618
I feel...

704
01:18:06,652 --> 01:18:08,587
I'm the only one
who can stop him.

705
01:18:08,621 --> 01:18:09,855
Yeah. Woman's intuition.

706
01:18:12,524 --> 01:18:13,693
Are you with me?

707
01:18:15,461 --> 01:18:16,530
Why risk my life?

708
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:19,032
This is a suicide mission.

709
01:18:21,033 --> 01:18:22,736
I'm out of friends to ask.

710
01:18:22,769 --> 01:18:25,472
And if we don't stop
this insanity,

711
01:18:25,505 --> 01:18:28,775
you risk your life anyway,
along with a billion others.

712
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:33,079
You're convincing.

713
01:18:36,548 --> 01:18:38,618
Well, well, well.

714
01:18:38,650 --> 01:18:39,685
<i>Agent Kavsky.</i>

715
01:18:40,752 --> 01:18:43,088
<i>I'd like to thank you.</i>

716
01:18:43,122 --> 01:18:47,961
And as a parting gift, I will send
you the coordinates of the ship.

717
01:18:47,993 --> 01:18:50,963
So you actually expect me
to believe you again?

718
01:18:50,997 --> 01:18:53,833
I want you to be promoted
and awarded medals.

719
01:18:53,865 --> 01:18:55,368
<i>You know, I've always
been on your side.</i>

720
01:18:56,034 --> 01:18:57,670
Not really convincing.

721
01:18:57,703 --> 01:18:59,639
<i>Look. What do you
want from me?</i>

722
01:18:59,671 --> 01:19:00,973
You want to save the world?

723
01:19:01,006 --> 01:19:02,641
<i>You want to save
all the children?</i>

724
01:19:02,675 --> 01:19:04,476
<i>And I'm giving you
that opportunity.</i>

725
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:06,746
<i>I gave you the coordinates
and the location of the ship.</i>

726
01:19:06,779 --> 01:19:08,481
<i>You do with it
what you want.</i>

727
01:19:08,514 --> 01:19:10,150
I've got a world to conquer.

728
01:19:10,716 --> 01:19:11,718
Gerry?

729
01:19:16,555 --> 01:19:18,023
Do you think he's bluffing?

730
01:19:22,094 --> 01:19:24,029
Hey.
Check your phone.

731
01:19:24,063 --> 01:19:26,766
Looks like
we've got coordinates.

732
01:19:26,798 --> 01:19:29,202
If he's thick enough to play
this game of cat and mouse,

733
01:19:29,234 --> 01:19:32,171
then these could be the real coordinates.
We have to take the risk

734
01:19:32,204 --> 01:19:34,474
and assume this is real.

735
01:19:34,506 --> 01:19:36,675
We need to mobilize
a team immediately.

736
01:19:40,846 --> 01:19:44,850
Use extreme precaution. You'll be
visible to the enemy at all times.

737
01:19:49,055 --> 01:19:51,724
When we get on the ground,
let's move, people.

738
01:19:51,756 --> 01:19:53,192
I expect a good show.

739
01:19:56,028 --> 01:19:57,564
All right then.

740
01:20:00,265 --> 01:20:03,536
Well, now we have
something to celebrate, Doc.

741
01:20:03,569 --> 01:20:05,439
Let's get ready to make some
waves, Dr. Lee.

742
01:20:07,873 --> 01:20:09,208
Yes!

743
01:20:37,168 --> 01:20:38,805
What now?

744
01:20:38,837 --> 01:20:40,739
We'll split up.

745
01:20:40,773 --> 01:20:44,077
- You search the upper deck. I'm going to the cargo hold.
- Got ya.

746
01:20:44,109 --> 01:20:45,612
Let's go.

747
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:41,201
James.
What do you see?

748
01:21:42,835 --> 01:21:44,237
This ship is deserted.

749
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:47,873
<i>Nothing. There's
no one here.</i>

750
01:21:49,641 --> 01:21:50,842
But I hear the children.

751
01:21:50,876 --> 01:21:52,279
There's no one
up on the bridge.

752
01:21:54,079 --> 01:21:56,815
This ship is all shot to shit.
There's blood everywhere.

753
01:22:13,698 --> 01:22:15,969
Okay, okay, okay!

754
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:29,282
Lucinda,
I've got bad news.

755
01:22:29,314 --> 01:22:30,682
<i>What's up?</i>

756
01:22:30,716 --> 01:22:33,219
Shit.

757
01:22:33,252 --> 01:22:35,922
Lucinda, I see rocks in front of us.

758
01:22:35,954 --> 01:22:38,123
We are gonna go down.

759
01:22:38,157 --> 01:22:39,125
<i>You need to hurry up!</i>

760
01:22:39,158 --> 01:22:41,928
How long will it take
before we hit the rocks?

761
01:22:41,961 --> 01:22:43,329
We still have
a few minutes.

762
01:22:43,362 --> 01:22:45,163
I'm coming back
your way.

763
01:23:12,925 --> 01:23:14,994
James. I found them.

764
01:23:15,027 --> 01:23:16,996
Hi, my dears.
Well...

765
01:23:17,029 --> 01:23:18,365
Who is crying here?

766
01:23:20,166 --> 01:23:22,735
Serpent, turn off
the loudspeaker.

767
01:23:38,717 --> 01:23:40,219
We're hitting the rocks.

768
01:23:48,828 --> 01:23:51,364
Come with me.
It's time to go.

769
01:24:00,171 --> 01:24:01,875
Let's get the mother
Mary out of here.

770
01:24:31,804 --> 01:24:34,007
Yes! She made it out.
I knew she would.

771
01:25:03,301 --> 01:25:04,804
I always wanted
a big family.

772
01:25:07,072 --> 01:25:09,509
What do you say?
You want to get married?

773
01:25:13,011 --> 01:25:13,880
I don't mind.

774
01:25:13,912 --> 01:25:16,915
- Yeah?
- But you don't speak Chinese.

775
01:25:18,216 --> 01:25:19,451
I can always learn.

776
01:25:23,255 --> 01:25:26,292
- See that? That's where the bombs are.
- Whoa...

777
01:25:26,324 --> 01:25:29,061
Ready to annihilate
half the Earth's population.

778
01:25:31,229 --> 01:25:33,231
Wait.

779
01:25:33,265 --> 01:25:37,235
Use extreme caution. You will be
visible to the enemy at all times.

780
01:25:37,269 --> 01:25:39,139
Don't let them know
that we know.

781
01:25:41,207 --> 01:25:43,176
There must be some interference
or something on the line. Look.

782
01:25:44,475 --> 01:25:46,045
Lee, what's going on?

783
01:25:48,847 --> 01:25:50,315
We'll beat Gerry
at his own game.

784
01:25:52,051 --> 01:25:54,387
Good news. The first bomb
was deactivated in Russia

785
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:56,021
and the child's all right.

786
01:25:56,055 --> 01:25:57,990
That's the Russian bomb,
Lee. What the fuck?

787
01:25:58,023 --> 01:25:59,192
What is going on?

788
01:25:59,225 --> 01:26:01,260
The system will only
work for two hours.

789
01:26:01,292 --> 01:26:03,261
So we need to hurry
and distract Gerry.

790
01:26:03,295 --> 01:26:06,065
Hey, it's time to push the button.

791
01:26:06,798 --> 01:26:08,466
All the bombs
were deactivated.

792
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:09,802
Hey!

793
01:26:14,974 --> 01:26:17,543
Gerry, I know
you're watching this.

794
01:26:24,015 --> 01:26:26,152
You fucking bitch.

795
01:26:34,204 --> 01:26:39,204
