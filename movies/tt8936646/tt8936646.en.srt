00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:55,043
Just hook it through there
and then pull it back this way.

494
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:56,125
Yeah.

He's with me.

512
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:54,785
There's a clearing on east side
of Sultana Kamal Bridge,

513

<i>just outside the city.

<i>- Four kilometers.</i>

515
00:50:06,416 --> 00:50:08,326
You gotta leave the kid behind, Tyler.

That's not the job.

519
00:50:30,041 --> 00:50:31,501
The job is fucked.

520
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:38,381
Just find my money, Nik.

521
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:52,535
[Ovi] Are you gonna
leave me in the street?

522
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:57,166
Your phone... It's loud.

523
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:02,666
The only chance
of getting my money is you, mate. So...

524
00:51:03,916 --> 00:51:04,916
no.

525
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:10,130
I'm like a package then.

526
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:13,330
Yeah, pretty much.

This?

Piano. I play the piano when I'm nervous.

531
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:35,375
It helps.

532
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:38,668
My father hates it when I do it.

533
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:46,075
He thinks of me the same way you do.

534
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:50,036
More like a thing than a person.

535
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,630
I didn't... I didn't mean it like that.

536

I told Nik that an extraction is...
It's not feasible.

Well, you know, the city
is surrounded by rivers.

644
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,080
There are bridges going in and out.

645
01:02:13,166 --> 01:02:18,416
But every one of those bridges currently
is blocked by a roadblock

646
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:21,830
because you are a very popular individual.

I figure we lie low a couple days,
we let the panic dissipate.

And we'll get you going.

Yeah, knee, back, shoulder...

[swallows and exhales]

657
01:02:56,958 --> 01:02:59,628
Okay. I gotta go. I gotta go.

658
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:01,575
I gotta kiss my wife.

659
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:06,673
But you stay here and rest up.
And I will be back.

660
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:11,793
It's good to see you, man. I missed you.

661
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:21,333
[door closes]

662
01:03:28,541 --> 01:03:29,541

01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,500
[hip-hop song playing]

665
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:17,645
[in Bengali] Don't you see I'm eating?

666
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,080
- [Farhad] I had him...
- [Asif] Had who?

667
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:21,826
The man you want.

668
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:24,416
I lost him...

669
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,630
near the market.

670
01:04:26,625 --> 01:04:28,625
Tell them to scour the market.

671
01:04:28,708 --> 01:04:29,918
[Shadek] Yes, sir.

672
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,290
- What is this?
- A gift.

673
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,500
When you catch him,

674
01:04:44,583 --> 01:04:46,673
I want to be the one to pull the trigger.

675
01:04:47,333 --> 01:04:49,543
If you let me do that,

676
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:52,665
I'll give you the other finger!

677
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:09,960
He made me feel like a fool.

678
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:12,710
Of course he did.

679
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:18,455
You're only a kid. Hmm?

680
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:41,328
Here's some advice, a gift.

681
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:46,583
Keep your other finger.

682
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:51,130
Because no matter how badass
you think you are...

683
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:55,460
there's always a badass
who's bigger than you.

684
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:14,923
[Tyler exhales heavily]

685
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:20,125
[Ovi] Tyler.

686
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:23,375
Yeah?

687
01:06:24,916 --> 01:06:28,786
If you had been killed today,
it would have been my fault.

688
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,750
No, mate. But it would've been my fault.

689
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:38,206
You don't look like a Tyler.

690
01:06:39,291 --> 01:06:40,541
[chuckles softly]

691
01:06:41,041 --> 01:06:42,211
No?

692
01:06:42,291 --> 01:06:43,331
What do I look like?

693
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:47,416
A Brad.

694
01:06:48,083 --> 01:06:49,173
[chuckles]

695
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:52,875
Yeah.

696
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,000
Can I ask you something?

697
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,500
It's Rake.

698
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,210
- What's Rake?
- My last name.

699
01:07:04,208 --> 01:07:05,918
That's not what I was going to ask.

700
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:08,875
That's a strange last name, though.

701
01:07:10,208 --> 01:07:12,128
Isn't that like a gardening tool?

702
01:07:16,291 --> 01:07:17,501
What were you gonna ask me?

703
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:25,666
If you were always this way.
You know... brave.

704
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:27,671
I'm not brave, mate.

705
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:33,290
Of course you are. You rescue people.

706
01:07:34,666 --> 01:07:38,666
Yeah, sometimes.
Sometimes I do other things.

707
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:42,875
Like killing people?

708
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,791
Yeah.

709
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:51,173
My father, he kills people, too.

710
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,790
Sometimes, I would sit with him at dinner,
look at him and think,

711
01:08:00,416 --> 01:08:02,746
he just killed somebody else's father
that day.

712
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:05,791
And I'd feel sick.

713
01:08:25,041 --> 01:08:26,461
You have a family?

714
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:31,253
I did have me a wife.

715
01:08:32,166 --> 01:08:33,206
Where is she?

716
01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:37,788
I don't know.
I haven't seen her in a long time.

717
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:41,083
Children?

718
01:08:43,416 --> 01:08:44,626
Yeah, a son.

719
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:47,205
Where is he?

720
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,205
He died a few years ago.

721
01:08:58,500 --> 01:08:59,630
How did he die?

722
01:09:02,041 --> 01:09:03,041
Lymphoma.

723
01:09:12,041 --> 01:09:13,041
How old was he?

724
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:17,625
Six.

725
01:09:21,916 --> 01:09:23,286
[breath trembling]

726
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:25,376
[scoffs]

727
01:09:26,916 --> 01:09:30,876
I wasn't even there... when he died.

728
01:09:33,333 --> 01:09:34,753
Where were you?

729
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,130
Kandahar, Afghanistan.
It was my third tour.

730
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:43,378
You were called away?

731
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:53,208
No.

732
01:09:57,875 --> 01:09:58,995
I left.

733
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:02,963
Voluntary.

734
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,245
Because you couldn't watch?

735
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:16,125
Yep.

736
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:25,630
I told you, mate. I'm not brave.
I'm just...

737
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,920
I'm just the opposite.

738
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:33,375
You know...

739
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:41,325
"You drown not by falling into the river,

740
01:10:43,041 --> 01:10:44,881
but by staying submerged in it."

741
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:50,921
Who told you that?

742
01:10:52,083 --> 01:10:53,753
I read it in a book in school.

743
01:11:17,916 --> 01:11:19,496
[vehicle approaching]

744
01:11:31,791 --> 01:11:35,881
[in Spanish] <i>Estancia Los Chanares.</i>

745
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,208
- [in English] Yes. Yes!
- [chuckles] I don't know...

746
01:11:38,291 --> 01:11:39,921
It's the best dove hunting in Argentina.

747
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:44,213
Just lie in this pool...
You lie in a pool and they fly around!

748
01:11:44,291 --> 01:11:45,751
[mimics wings flapping]

749
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:48,463
And you shoot them. [mimics gun firing]

750
01:11:48,541 --> 01:11:50,171
And you sip a Cuba Libre.

751
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:55,458
I shot my first dove when I was
ten years old. Have I told you this?

752
01:11:55,541 --> 01:11:57,421
- I haven't. Listen.
- I think you have.

753
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:02,080
No. It was when I was ten years old,
my dad... My dad... The gun backfired,

754
01:12:02,166 --> 01:12:04,996
gave me a black eye,
and my dad laughs at me.

755
01:12:05,083 --> 01:12:09,083
I used to move so quick,
kill those little shits.

756
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:11,375
Not anymore, though.

757
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,920
It sucks getting old, man. Sucks!

758
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,830
- [loudly] Getting old sucks.
- Shh.

759
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:18,206
[softly] Sucks!

760
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,250
I think he's asleep.

761
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,540
What a goddamn tragedy, hmm?

762
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:33,666
That kid is a walking corpse.

763
01:12:40,416 --> 01:12:42,076
Asif will never let him live.

764
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:45,291
Think the disgrace.

765
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:50,705
I mean, you get him home. And then, what?
His father's in prison.

766
01:12:52,041 --> 01:12:53,541
There's no way to protect him.

767
01:12:57,541 --> 01:12:59,181
You know what the best thing
you could do?

768
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:02,128
The best thing you could do, honestly,
would be to go up there right now

769
01:13:02,916 --> 01:13:05,916
and just go put a bullet in his brain.
Make it painless.

770
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,580
'Cause the animals out there,
they're not gonna be... as kind to him.

771
01:13:14,875 --> 01:13:16,535
They like to start with the ears.

772
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:20,665
Then they cut off
each finger at the joint.

773
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:21,830
Mate, you're drunk.

774
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:27,423
I'm talking about mercy, Tyler.

775
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:37,790
You know how much he's worth?

776
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:40,568
We're talking about a kid, Gaspar.

777
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:42,495
We're talking about a gangster's kid.

778
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:46,538
With a price tag
of ten million on his head.

779
01:13:46,625 --> 01:13:48,165
You need to sober up, mate.

780
01:13:49,541 --> 01:13:53,881
You're a mercenary, right, Tyler?
Why don't you act the mercenary?

781
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:57,463
Aren't you sick of this life?
'Cause I am and I...

782
01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:03,673
I do not wanna end it playing hero
on some goddamn suicide mission...

783
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:05,540
What are you doing?
You said you'd help me.

784
01:14:05,625 --> 01:14:08,705
I am helping you. Ten million dollars.

785
01:14:10,375 --> 01:14:12,325
I'll get you to the border
in a couple hours.

786
01:14:12,416 --> 01:14:16,706
It's money in your pocket.
I take care of the body. Painless.

787
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:18,581
And it's the best that
that kid can hope for.

788
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Did you call someone?

789
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:23,916
- [groans]
- Who'd you call?

790
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,580
Why are you such a hypocrite? You've got
the blood of a hundred men on your hands...

791
01:14:27,666 --> 01:14:28,666
[grunts] Answer me!

792
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:32,383
[panting] Put your hands on me?

793
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:33,458
What'd you do?

794
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:37,000
Do you know what happens to me
if they find out that I'm helping you?

795
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:39,083
You know what happens to my wife?

796
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:41,625
Asif's a friend.

797
01:14:42,916 --> 01:14:45,286
I did some work for him.
We made a deal.

798
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,960
He gets the kid, you get your freedom,
and we both get rich.

799
01:14:50,041 --> 01:14:52,501
What do you want from me?
Walk upstairs and shoot the kid

800
01:14:52,583 --> 01:14:53,633
in the fucking head?

801
01:14:53,708 --> 01:14:57,378
No. No. I'll do it.

802
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:04,246
Don't do this.

803
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,673
You saved my life once.

804
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:09,668
Now I'm gonna save yours.

805
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:13,380
Step aside.

806
01:15:17,083 --> 01:15:18,543
[both grunting]

807
01:15:38,875 --> 01:15:40,495
Come on, Tyler. Stop!

808
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:44,750
[choking]

809
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:58,000
[panting]

810
01:16:00,333 --> 01:16:02,333
What are we doing, man? Huh?

811
01:16:04,166 --> 01:16:05,496
Come on, stay down.

812
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Stay down.

813

Hey, kid.

817
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:41,881
I know it looks bad. I know it looks bad.
