<i>(Stephen Segerman)</i>
<i>I got my nickname from this song.</i>

11
00:01:09,544 --> 00:01:13,923
When I was in the Army they used to
mispronounce Segerman as Sugar Man.

12
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:17,218
And then they just started calling me
Sugar and that became my nickname.

13
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:23,808
<i>It's 40 years since this LP called</i>
Cold Fact <i>by Rodriguez was released.</i>

14
00:01:24,434 --> 00:01:27,478
<i>And in South Africa</i>
<i>it was a very popular album.</i>

15
00:01:27,562 --> 00:01:30,356
<i>It was one of the biggest albums</i>
<i>of the day.</i>

16
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,526
<i>But the thing was,</i>
<i>we didn't know who this guy was.</i>

17
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,695
<i>All our other rock stars,</i>
<i>we had all the information we needed.</i>

18
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,198
<i>But this guy? There was nothing.</i>

19
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:42,618
<i>And then we found out</i>
<i>that he had committed suicide.</i>

20
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:47,540
<i>He set himself alight on stage and</i>
<i>burnt to death in front of the audience.</i>

21
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,377
<i>It was the most incredible thing.</i>
<i>It wasn't just a suicide.</i>

22
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:55,256
<i>It was probably the most</i>
<i>grotesque suicide in rock history.</i>

23
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:38,359
(thunder crashing)

24
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:12,268
<i>(Dennis Coffey)</i> The first time that
I remember actually recognising him is

25
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,853
Mike Theodore called me
on the phone one day and said,

26
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:17,815
''I have this artist
I want you to come see with me.

27
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,692
''This guy's name is Rodriguez,

28
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:21,735
''he's working down by the Detroit River.

29
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,654
''There's a bar down there,

30
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:26,282
''down by the wharf riverside district.

31
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,741
''Let's go see him tonight.

32
00:04:27,826 --> 00:04:29,076
''I think you'll really like him.''

33
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,455
<i>So that night, I remember,</i>
<i>we pull up...</i>

34
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:36,709
<i>away in this kinda isolated</i>
<i>part of Detroit</i>

35
00:04:36,793 --> 00:04:38,836
<i>right on the side of the Detroit River,</i>

36
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,756
<i>and you could see the mist in the air</i>
<i>coming off the river. We could feel it.</i>

37
00:04:42,841 --> 00:04:46,552
And we went inside there,
and as we walked in the door,

38
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:49,346
we could hear behind us
the sound of the freighters

39
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:51,140
as they're going down the river,

40
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:54,560
and so it's like you're walking out
of a Sherlock Holmes novel.

41
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:58,022
You walk out of the mist
and you go into this place,

42
00:04:58,106 --> 00:05:00,566
and inside the place,
it's all full of smoke,

43
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,276
so there's a mist inside there.

44
00:05:02,694 --> 00:05:05,904
<i>(Mike Theodore) Boom, hey, you know,</i>
<i>it's a wall of smoke.</i>

45
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:10,576
<i>Beer all over the place. Peanut shells.</i>
<i>It was just a mess.</i>

46
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,663
And then you hear this strumming sound.

47
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,707
Strumming and batting the guitar.

48
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,709
(mimics guitar batting)

49
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:24,256
And then you hear this voice.
Strange voice.

50
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:26,717
<i>(Coffey) Finally, we walked</i>
<i>through the smoke, and I looked,</i>

51
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:29,261
<i>and there in the far corner I saw...</i>

52
00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:32,681
I could see the shadow of a man
and I couldn't see his face.

53
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,726
I said, ''What's the deal?''
So we got a little closer...

54
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:41,690
<i>(Theodore) And you see this guy</i>
<i>with his back to you.</i>

55
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:46,737
<i>So all you see is his back</i>
<i>and he's in a corner, singing.</i>

56
00:05:47,364 --> 00:05:50,949
<i>It was an ethereal scene, if you will.</i>

57
00:05:51,034 --> 00:05:56,455
Foggy night, foghorns, smoke so thick
you couldn't see through it.

58
00:05:57,207 --> 00:05:59,083
<i>And here's this voice.</i>

59
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,627
<i>(Coffey) Maybe it forced you</i>
<i>to listen to the lyrics</i>

60
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:03,712
<i>'cause you couldn't see the guy's face.</i>

61
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:07,091
<i>That's when we talked to him and figured</i>
<i>we needed to do an album on him.</i>

62
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:11,470
The only writer that I had heard of,
of that time period,

63
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:15,057
was maybe Bob Dylan,
that was writing that well.

<i>And, uh, sometimes</i>
<i>I might catch him in the corner.</i>

79
00:07:42,187 --> 00:07:45,647
You know, Detroit's got its share of,
uh, burned-out, desolate areas

80
00:07:45,773 --> 00:07:48,942
and I would occasionally see him, um,

81
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:51,987
far away from The Brewery,
and I wondered,

82
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:55,324
and it just added
to this mythology of him.

83
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:59,119
Like, what is he doing?
What is he doing? What does he do?

84
00:07:59,204 --> 00:08:03,790
I heard he did a little roofing,
some construction work.

85
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,960
Um, I think that's how he got his money
at the time.

86
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:09,671
He just was, you know,
and I say this with love,

87
00:08:09,797 --> 00:08:12,132
I say this with respect, but,

88
00:08:12,217 --> 00:08:14,218
I thought he was just a...

89
00:08:14,886 --> 00:08:19,097
just not much more than a kind of
a homeless person, you know?

90
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:22,226
He just was a drifter.
He was just... Um...

91
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:26,188
<i>I didn't know if he had a home,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

92
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:30,275
<i>He'd look like maybe he'd go</i>
<i>from shelter to shelter or something.</i>

93
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,116
<i>(Coffey) Detroit in the '70s</i>
<i>was a hard place.</i>

94
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:39,785
<i>Well, it's still a hard place.</i>

95
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:44,998
<i>Lot of decay, lots of ruined houses.</i>
<i>Real poverty exists in this city.</i>

96
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:48,460
<i>And those streets</i>
<i>were Rodriguez's natural habitat.</i>

97
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:51,672
Any time we met him
to talk about what we were doing,

98
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:55,676
he would always meet us on a corner
somewhere in his neighbourhood.

99
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,262
Most of the time
he wasn't coming to my house.

100
00:08:58,346 --> 00:09:01,390
He'd say, ''Meet me on the corner
of this street and that street,''

101
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,975
and we would be there.

102
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:06,186
Uh, Mike and I would get out of our cars
and park our cars,

103
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:07,646
so we'd be standing on the corner,

104
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,398
and then we'd look round
and he'd be there all of a sudden.

105
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,941
He'd just show up.

106
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:13,860
<i>We thought he was like</i>
<i>the inner city poet.</i>

107
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:17,531
<i>You know? Putting his poems to music</i>
<i>of what he saw.</i>

108
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,826
<i>And it was definitely a very gritty look</i>

109
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,078
<i>at what he saw</i>
<i>on the streets of Detroit.</i>

110
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:26,665
<i>What he saw in his neighbourhood.</i>
<i>Who was walking around the streets.</i>

111
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:31,837
<i>And the way he presented it in a song,</i>
<i>I thought was very, very interesting.</i>

112
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:36,133
<i>(Theodore) We were working</i>

113

<i>you went, ''Whoa, this guy's got it.''</i>

114
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:46,018
<i>Rodriguez, at that time,</i>
<i>had all the machinery in place.</i>

115

<i>Big names, big money behind it.</i>
<i>Circumstances were right.</i>

116
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:55,694
<i>Why didn't it make it? That's the</i>
<i>big question that today still haunts me.</i>

117
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:59,448
Did he get enough promotion?
Did he do enough performances?

118
00:10:00,283 --> 00:10:02,034
Was he too political?

119
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,662
Was there this or was there that?

120
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,956
Should it have been green
instead of orange?

121
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,126
Should it have been a violin
instead of an oboe?

122
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,003
On and on you can go.

123
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:17,633
But the end of the day is, if you
listen to the stuff now, you'd say,

124
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:20,677

00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:46,388
Let me see.

147
00:11:46,431 --> 00:11:49,808
Possibly it's in this book,
I don't know where.

148
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,229
These are all my photos
from when I was acting.

149
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:58,442
That's me, and that's Jimmy Dean.
That was in 1955.

150
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:02,821
Hang on, I think I've found them.
Think they're in here.

151
00:12:04,574 --> 00:12:06,324
Yeah, here they are.

152
00:12:07,452 --> 00:12:10,287
Wow. Good Lord, here they are.

153
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,333
You know, I haven't seen these pictures
in almost 35 years.

154
00:12:18,296 --> 00:12:20,505
He's my most memorable artist.

155
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,176
You know, I've produced
a lot of great ones, but...

156
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,680
he's my most memorable.

157
00:12:29,307 --> 00:12:31,183
<i>It's not just a talent.</i>

158
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,935
<i>He's like...</i>

159
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:37,439
<i>He's like a wise man, a prophet.</i>

160
00:12:37,482 --> 00:12:41,193
<i>He's way beyond</i>
<i>just being a musical artist.</i>

161
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,362
<i>And he probably could have done</i>
<i>fantastically well</i>

162
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:45,864
<i>if he had have continued.</i>

163
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:49,951
When I met him, they said,
''Rodriguez, this is Steve Rowland.

164
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,871
''He really likes your album.''
And Rodriguez said to me,

165
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:56,166
''Well, did you like <i>Cold Facts?''</i>

166
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,835
I said, ''Man, I thought
it was absolutely brilliant.

167
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,378
''Absolutely brilliant.

168
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:04,216
''I can't believe that this album
didn't do anything.

169
00:13:04,342 --> 00:13:06,885
''It's just a fantastic album.''

170
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,512
So he played me...

171
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:12,724
Well, his next album was on...
In those days you had cassettes.

172
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,312
He had demos of this next album that
he was gonna call <i>Coming From Reality</i>.

173
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:22,567
And I said, ''Wow, man,
this has got to be a smash.

174
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:24,236
''These are great songs.

175
00:13:24,362 --> 00:13:29,908
''Little bit... Little bit different from
the others,'' I said, ''but great songs.''

176
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:33,245
I said, ''And a couple of them
were so sad.'' You know.

177
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:36,581
There's one in there
that's absolutely a killer.

178
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:38,708
It's one of the saddest songs that...

179
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:43,839
I'm laughing, but it's one of
the saddest songs that I've ever heard.

180
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,217
And it's a very simple song.
Hang on, I wanna play this. Hang on.

181
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,511
Okay, listen to these words.

196

was the album was released
in November of 1971,

197
00:15:14,972 --> 00:15:18,975
and we expected big things.
And it did absolutely nothing.

And then, two weeks before Christmas,

Sussex dropped him off the label.

was, ''I lost my job

I remember I was in high school

234
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:30,375
and we heard this song, ''I wonder
how many times you've had sex?''

235
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:33,044
And at that time South Africa
was very conservative.

236
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,421
It was the height of apartheid,

237
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:38,383
and there wasn't television here.

238
00:18:38,425 --> 00:18:41,886
That's how conservative it was,
'cause television was communist.

239
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:44,681
It was really... You wouldn't believe.

240
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,725
Everything was restricted,
everything was censored.

241
00:18:47,852 --> 00:18:49,227
Everything was...

242
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,437

243
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:54,232
<i>''Who's that?'' Said, ''That's Rodriguez.''</i>

244
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:58,570

<i>of a rebel sort of icon.</i>

245
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,781
<i>But the strange thing was</i>
<i>that we all bought his records.</i>

246
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:04,742
Everybody I knew had his records.
<i>I Wonder,</i>

247
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,036
that was the big song
that everybody was singing

248
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,580
and we all bought a record.

249
00:19:08,622 --> 00:19:12,292
And there he was on the cover,
sort of a hippy with shades.

250
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:15,545
But nobody knew anything about him.
He was a mystery.

251
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:19,465
Unlike other artists
that you could read about from America,

252
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:24,095
get to know something about them,
there was zilch. Nobody knew anything.

253
00:19:24,138 --> 00:19:28,433

his picture on the cover of the record.

<i>Cold Fact</i> by Rodriguez.

270
00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:22,320
To us, it was one of the most
famous records of all time.

271
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,782
<i>The message it had was:</i>
<i>''Be anti-establishment.''</i>

Anti-Establishment Blues.

273
00:20:28,285 --> 00:20:29,953
We didn't know what the word
''anti-establishment'' was

274
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:33,122
until it cropped up on a Rodriguez song
and then we found out,

275
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:36,167
it's OK to protest against your society,

276
00:20:36,293 --> 00:20:39,087
to be angry with your society.

277
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,340

where every means was used
to prevent apartheid from,

this album somehow had in it...

lyrics that almost set us free
as oppressed peoples.

Any revolution needs an anthem

283

and in South Africa
<i>Cold Fact</i> was the album

284

00:21:34,977 --> 00:21:36,936
<i>but, actually,</i>
<i>if you look back at the time</i>

294
00:21:36,979 --> 00:21:39,939
<i>we were in the middle of apartheid,</i>
<i>the height of apartheid.</i>

295
00:21:39,982 --> 00:21:43,151
<i>South Africa was under sanctions</i>
<i>from countries from all over the world.</i>

296
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,737
<i>South African musicians</i>
<i>were not allowed to play overseas.</i>

297
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:48,906
<i>No foreign acts</i>
<i>were allowed to visit South Africa.</i>

298
00:21:48,949 --> 00:21:50,992
<i>It was a closed-door situation</i>

299
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,161
<i>between South Africa</i>
<i>and the rest of the world.</i>

300
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:57,165
♫ <i>Woke up this morning</i>
<i>with an ache in my head</i>

301
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:01,085
♫ <i>I splashed on my clothes</i>
<i>as I spilled out of bed</i>

302
00:22:01,128 --> 00:22:05,256

303
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:09,969
♫ <i>But all I heard</i>
<i>was the establishment's blues</i>

304
00:22:10,012 --> 00:22:12,263
<i>(Segerman) The countries around</i>
<i>the world were saying horrible things</i>

305
00:22:12,306 --> 00:22:13,765
<i>about the apartheid government</i>

306
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:16,934
<i>but we didn't know</i>
<i>because they controlled the news.</i>

307
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:20,271
<i>The majority of the population</i>
<i>had been marginalised</i>

308
00:22:20,314 --> 00:22:23,816
<i>and forced out of the commerce in areas.</i>

309
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,693
<i>It was what had happened</i>
<i>in Nazi Germany.</i>

310
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:27,653
<i>It was a spin-off from Nazi Germany,</i>

311
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,698
<i>but if a newspaper published it,</i>
<i>they'd get prosecuted.</i>

312
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:34,786
<i>So, because of that, South Africa had</i>
<i>achieved a pariah status in the world.</i>

313
00:22:34,828 --> 00:22:37,622
<i>There were cultural boycotts.</i>
<i>There were sporting boycotts.</i>

314
00:22:37,664 --> 00:22:41,125
<i>It was a very isolated society.</i>
<i>So we were cut off</i>.

315
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,794
We all knew apartheid was wrong,

316
00:22:42,878 --> 00:22:44,045
but living in South Africa,

317
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,463
there wasn't much, as a white person,

318
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:46,798
you could do about it,

319
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,633
'cause the government was very strict.

320
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:50,802
It was a military state,
to a large degree.

321
00:22:50,886 --> 00:22:52,387
If you spoke out against apartheid,

322
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,472
you could be thrown into prison
for three years.

323
00:22:54,515 --> 00:22:57,809
<i>So although a lot of whites</i>
<i>were part of the struggle,</i>

324
00:22:57,851 --> 00:22:59,519
<i>the majority of whites were not.</i>

325
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:03,981
<i>You were watched. There were spies.</i>
<i>It was scary and people were scared.</i>

326
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:06,901
But out of the Afrikaans
community emerged

327
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,987
a group of Afrikaans
musicians, songwriters,

328
00:23:10,072 --> 00:23:14,325
and for them, when they heard Rodriguez,
it was like a voice spoke to them

329
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,329
and said, ''Guys, there's a way out.
There's a way out.

330
00:23:18,372 --> 00:23:21,499
''You can write music.
You can write imagery.

331
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,167
''You can sing, you can perform.''

332
00:23:23,252 --> 00:23:27,004
And that was where, really,
the first opposition to apartheid

333
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:29,674
came from inside
the Afrikaans community.

334
00:23:29,758 --> 00:23:33,177
It was these young Afrikaans guys
and, to a man,

335
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,763
they'll tell you
they were influenced by Rodriguez.

336
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:38,015
<i>Koos Kombuis. Willem Möller.</i>

337
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,892
<i>The late Johannes Kerkorrel.</i>

338
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:45,523
The guys who were regarded as the icons
of the Afrikaans music revolution

339
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:48,067
will all tell you,
''Rodriguez was our guy.''

340
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,861

341
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,739
<i>(Möller)</i>
<i>We call it the Voëlvry movement</i>

342
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:56,367

<i>singing against apartheid.</i>

343
00:23:56,452 --> 00:23:59,245
All of us listened to Rodriguez
at some point. All of us.

344
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,372
<i>It had an enormous impact.</i>

345
00:24:01,457 --> 00:24:03,958
<i>It made you just think</i>
<i>that there's another way.</i>

346
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:08,254

♫ <i>Set if off, set if off</i>

350
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:19,432
<i>(Möller) The biggest hit</i>

351
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:22,810
<i>which was when PW Botha</i>
<i>was the president then.</i>

352
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:26,731
The real bad guy. When he came on TV,
he used to talk like that.

353
00:24:28,317 --> 00:24:30,985
<i>And this song said, ''switch it off,</i>

<i>(male interviewer)</i>
So what lines do you think

355
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,830
were the lines they had problem with?

356
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:44,415
Ah, gee whiz, it's all of them.

357
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:47,627
''Sugar Man, won't you hurry

''For a blue coin, won't you bring back
all those colours to my dreams?''

359
00:24:52,132 --> 00:24:54,008

''Silver magic ships, you carry

00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,141
Uh...

363
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,851

364
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:05,353

-But it's drugs?
-It's certainly drugs.

366
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,859
During the apartheid years,
it was just impossible to play it.

367
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,861
And what happened if you did play it?

368
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:17,114
Well, you couldn't.
I'd like to show you why.

369
00:25:21,995 --> 00:25:24,872
Right, here we have the album,
the vinyl.

370
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:28,459
At the back of the sleeve
you'll see a sticker that says ''Avoid.''

371
00:25:28,502 --> 00:25:32,296
But when you open the album
and take it out from its sleeve,

372
00:25:33,048 --> 00:25:36,509
you would see that they have
scratched that particular song

373
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:40,304
with a sharp tool to make sure
that it would not go out on air.

374
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:45,351
<i>And that's the way that they</i>
<i>banned the music which, in my mind,</i>

375
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:50,147
<i>was quite a brutal way of ensuring the</i>
<i>song would never be heard on the air.</i>

376
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:54,151
<i>(Steve Harris) Most of those tracks</i>
<i>were on the banned list at SABC</i>

377
00:25:54,236 --> 00:25:57,572
<i>and they ran</i>
<i>the broadcast industry completely.</i>

378
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,408
<i>There weren't any independent</i>
<i>radio stations or TV stations.</i>

379
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:06,205
Obviously, when that word got out,
it just made the record more desirable.

380
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,000
You know,
it's like having something banned.

381
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:12,587
You're 16, 17 years old
and you've got something that's banned.

382
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:14,589
It was absolutely perfect.

<i>(Segerman)</i> Cold Fact <i>was just one</i>
<i>of the albums we had in our collections,</i>

393
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:11,228
<i>and for 10, 20 years, it was just</i>

<i>But then a pivotal event happened</i>
<i>that changed everything for me.</i>

395
00:27:15,525 --> 00:27:16,984
<i>We were down in Camps Bay beach.</i>

396
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:20,196
We were sitting around on the beach
and a friend of mine,

397
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,573
a woman, who was from South Africa,

398
00:27:22,658 --> 00:27:26,869
but she had got married
and emigrated to Los Angeles,

399
00:27:26,953 --> 00:27:31,332
she said to me, ''Where can I
buy <i>Cold Fact</i> in South Africa?''

400
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:35,252
And I turned round and I pointed
to a store across the road

401
00:27:35,337 --> 00:27:38,589
that sold CDs and I said,
''You can buy it at that store.''

402
00:27:38,674 --> 00:27:42,259
She said, ''Really? Because, you know,
you can't buy it anywhere in America.

403
00:27:42,344 --> 00:27:44,553
''I've asked everywhere in America,
no one's even heard of it.''

404
00:27:44,638 --> 00:27:47,139
<i>And that was a pivotal moment,</i>
<i>'cause I didn't know that.</i>

405
00:27:47,224 --> 00:27:48,599
<i>I thought everybody knew Rodriguez,</i>

406
00:27:48,684 --> 00:27:51,227
<i>especially in America</i>
<i>'cause he was American.</i>

407
00:27:51,311 --> 00:27:54,438
<i>So my next thought was,</i>
<i>''Ah, Rodriguez, that's interesting.''</i>

408
00:27:54,523 --> 00:27:56,941
<i>I went back... I came back home</i>
<i>and I took out my Rodriguez records</i>

409
00:27:57,025 --> 00:27:59,443
<i>and that's when I realised</i>
<i>there was nothing on the record</i>

410
00:27:59,528 --> 00:28:01,696
<i>to tell us who he was</i>
<i>or where he was from.</i>

411
00:28:02,072 --> 00:28:03,948
On <i>Cold Fact</i> there are four names.

412
00:28:04,032 --> 00:28:06,909
On the front cover
it just says ''Rodriguez.''

413
00:28:06,993 --> 00:28:09,787
But if we take the record out
and examine the sleeve,

414
00:28:09,913 --> 00:28:12,707
the artist's name is Sixto Rodriguez.

415
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,291
<i>But if you look at the tracks,</i>

416
00:28:14,376 --> 00:28:16,001
<i>six of these tracks</i>

417
00:28:16,086 --> 00:28:18,462
<i>are credited to Jesus Rodriguez,</i>

418
00:28:18,547 --> 00:28:19,922
<i>and four of these tracks</i>

419
00:28:20,006 --> 00:28:22,633
<i>are credited to Sixth Prince.</i>

420
00:28:22,718 --> 00:28:24,385
<i>So who actually wrote these songs</i>

421
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:25,720
<i>and who are all these people?</i>

422
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:28,973
<i>We didn't have any more information</i>
<i>than a record</i>

423
00:28:29,057 --> 00:28:32,601
<i>with him sitting on the cover</i>
<i>with a hat and sunglasses on.</i>

424
00:28:32,686 --> 00:28:35,688
<i>We didn't know how tall he was</i>
<i>'cause he was sitting cross-legged.</i>

425
00:28:35,772 --> 00:28:37,231
<i>So how do you solve a mystery?</i>

426
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,316
<i>You use whatever</i>
<i>information's available.</i>

427
00:28:39,401 --> 00:28:42,695
<i>What did we have?</i>
<i>A record cover with lyrics.</i>

428
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:44,447
So we started looking
quite deeply at the lyrics

429
00:28:44,531 --> 00:28:45,990
and seeing what they said,

430
00:28:46,074 --> 00:28:48,701
and some of them, very few of them,
had geographical references.

431
00:28:48,785 --> 00:28:51,412
The one <i>You Can't Get Away</i> starts off,

432
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,122
''Born in the troubled city

433
00:28:53,206 --> 00:28:56,000
''In Rock and Roll, USA.''

434
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:57,501
Born in which troubled city?

435
00:28:57,586 --> 00:28:59,670
Seems all the cities were troubled
in the late '60s.

436
00:28:59,755 --> 00:29:02,047
''In the shadow of the tallest building.''

437
00:29:02,132 --> 00:29:04,300
The tallest building, as far as we knew,
was in New York.

438
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,719
And at the bottom of the song
this verse says,

439
00:29:06,803 --> 00:29:08,429
''In a hotel room in Amsterdam.''

440
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:14,351
Then it says, ''Going down a dusty
Georgian side road I wander.'' Georgia?

441
00:29:14,436 --> 00:29:16,353
So we've had Amsterdam,
we've had Georgia,

442
00:29:16,438 --> 00:29:17,897
we've had the world's tallest building.

443
00:29:18,565 --> 00:29:20,274
Not much to go on.

444
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:29,450
<i>(Bartholomew-Strydom)</i>
<i>Well, what I heard,</i>

445
00:29:29,493 --> 00:29:30,910
<i>and the story differs a lot,</i>

446
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:34,622
<i>and a lot of people have different</i>
<i>versions of the story, but what I heard,</i>

447
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,416
<i>he hadn't played a concert</i>
<i>in a very long time.</i>

448
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:41,378
And a promoter got him
to play a concert,

449
00:29:41,463 --> 00:29:44,131
and he was hoping
it was gonna be a great show.

450
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:47,343
Of course, the show didn't
work out that way. It started out...

451
00:29:47,427 --> 00:29:51,430
The sound wasn't good.
The venue wasn't good.

452
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:54,141
A lot of the factors
surrounding the show wasn't good.

453
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:56,101
And as the show went on and on,

454
00:29:56,186 --> 00:30:00,773
it started going downhill from there.
People started ridiculing him.

455
00:30:00,857 --> 00:30:06,153
People started whistling
or making mention of the fact that,

456
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,614
you know,
the show wasn't going as planned.

457
00:30:08,698 --> 00:30:12,284
And it got to a point where,
just very quietly, very gently,

458
00:30:12,369 --> 00:30:13,828
he just sang his last song.

459
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:16,580
''But thanks for your time
Then you can thank me for mine

460
00:30:16,665 --> 00:30:18,624
''And after that's said forget it.''

461
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:23,045
And he reached down and pulled up a gun
and pulled the trigger.

462
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,799
And that was the dramatic,
very dramatic ending,

463
00:30:26,883 --> 00:30:29,468
to what was actually a non-career.

464
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,670
<i>(Segerman)</i> In 1996,
the South African record label

465
00:31:04,754 --> 00:31:08,966
released Rodriguez's second album,
<i>Coming From Reality,</i>

466
00:31:09,092 --> 00:31:11,886
on CD for the first time
in South Africa.

467
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,471
And because they thought
I knew a lot about him,

468
00:31:14,514 --> 00:31:17,224
they asked if I wanted to co-write
the liner notes for the booklet,

469
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:18,684
which I did.

470
00:31:18,768 --> 00:31:23,147
And I'll read some of it to you.
They start off by saying,

471
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:26,650
''If ever there is an air of intrigue
and mystery around a pop artist,

472
00:31:26,735 --> 00:31:29,445
''it is around the artist
known as Rodriguez.

473
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:32,656
''There's no air of intrigue and mystery
around him anywhere else in the world

474
00:31:32,741 --> 00:31:35,868
''because his two albums,
<i>Coming From Reality</i> and <i>Cold Fact,</i>

475
00:31:35,952 --> 00:31:38,746
''were monumental flops everywhere else.''

476
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,289
And this is the important part.

477
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:44,960
''There were no concrete cold facts
about the artist known as Rodriguez.

478
00:31:45,045 --> 00:31:47,463
''Any musicologist detectives out there?''

479
00:31:47,964 --> 00:31:50,758
And that,
that's the line that changed everything.

480
00:31:51,885 --> 00:31:53,677
<i>(Bartholomew-Strydom)</i>
<i>I started searching for Rodriguez</i>

481
00:31:53,762 --> 00:31:55,971
<i>when a few of us</i>
<i>were sitting around in the Army</i>

482
00:31:56,056 --> 00:31:58,432
<i>and somebody said,</i>
<i>''How did Rodriguez die?''</i>

483
00:31:58,516 --> 00:31:59,892
And just coincidence,

484
00:31:59,976 --> 00:32:02,394
at the time I was looking
for subject matter to write an article.

485
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:05,356
<i>I remember having, like, five points</i>
<i>on a piece of paper.</i>

486
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,776
<i>And number four, or something,</i>
<i>was ''Find out how Rodriguez died.''</i>

487
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,570
<i>I thought it would make a good story.</i>

488
00:32:11,613 --> 00:32:13,697
So that was in the back of my mind
for many years

489
00:32:13,782 --> 00:32:17,534
and then, many years later,
I came across this, um,

490
00:32:18,078 --> 00:32:23,415
re-release of <i>Coming From Reality</i>
and inside, the liner notes said,

491
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,877
''There were no concrete cold facts
about the artist known as Rodriguez.

492
00:32:26,962 --> 00:32:31,590
''Any musicologist detectives out there?''
Um, was the question,

493
00:32:31,675 --> 00:32:33,801
and I think that to me,
was like an invitation.

494
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,970
I thought, ''Well, maybe it's me''.

495
00:32:38,431 --> 00:32:42,768
<i>The first way I tried to find him</i>
<i>was to just follow the money.</i>

496
00:32:42,852 --> 00:32:44,103
Normally, you follow the money.

497
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:45,604
That's how you get
to the bottom of anything.

498
00:32:46,272 --> 00:32:48,607
<i>But where do dead men's money go?</i>

499
00:32:48,692 --> 00:32:51,068
<i>I was astounded that</i>
<i>no one knew anything about him.</i>

500
00:32:51,194 --> 00:32:55,489
<i>I guess it was reminiscent</i>
<i>of how bad the music industry was.</i>

501
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,408
<i>They were renowned</i>
<i>for ripping people off.</i>

502
00:32:57,492 --> 00:33:01,412
And it is one thing,
if they had said to me, ''Oh, yeah,

503
00:33:01,496 --> 00:33:05,833
''we send the money
to X place or Y,'' or whatever,

504
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,210
but they just kept on being very vague.

505
00:33:08,294 --> 00:33:12,047
<i>And, in fact, when I put some pressure</i>
<i>on somebody, I did get an address,</i>

506
00:33:12,132 --> 00:33:13,632
<i>and I called</i>

507
00:33:13,717 --> 00:33:16,635
<i>and, I can't remember</i>
<i>if I spoke to someone or left a message,</i>

508
00:33:16,678 --> 00:33:19,638
<i>but when I called the next day,</i>
<i>the number had been changed.</i>

509
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:20,848
<i>And that to me was...</i>

510
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:24,351
I mean, that's a gift
for anyone who wants to be a detective,

511
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:28,897
is an obstacle,
because an obstacle is an inspiration.

512
00:33:28,982 --> 00:33:31,608
If you just find things easily,
they're not inspiring,

513
00:33:31,651 --> 00:33:34,945
and this was a great obstacle
that somebody had changed their number.

514
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:39,450
I just smelt a dirty money story
somewhere there.

515
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:41,243
<i>(male interviewer)</i>
<i>So, if you compare to other artists,</i>

516
00:33:41,327 --> 00:33:42,953
<i>how big was it actually?</i>

517
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:45,080
<i>(Robbie Mann) Every month it just sold.</i>

518
00:33:45,165 --> 00:33:48,042
<i>And every party you went to</i>
<i>and every place you went to,</i>

519
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,544
<i>you'd hear that album at least once.</i>

520
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:55,007
I don't think I could even think
of how many albums he's sold here

521
00:33:55,091 --> 00:33:57,551
'cause it's a long period of time.

522
00:33:57,927 --> 00:34:00,721
<i>(male interviewer)</i>
What could be probable?

523
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,724
(sighs)

524
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:08,020
I'd have to guess. Maybe half a million
copies over that period of time.

525
00:34:08,938 --> 00:34:11,774
<i>It's a lot of records,</i>
<i>especially for a small country.</i>

526
00:34:11,858 --> 00:34:14,318
<i>Gold record, ten times over.</i>

527
00:34:14,402 --> 00:34:17,154
<i>(male interviewer)</i> Rodriguez never got
to know that he was big in South Africa.

528
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,697
How could that be?

529
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:22,034
Don't know.
I mean, everything would have been...

530
00:34:22,118 --> 00:34:23,702
I find that strange.

531
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,038
<i>I have no idea.</i>

532
00:34:26,122 --> 00:34:28,165
<i>(male interviewer) But you must</i>
<i>have sent royalties somewhere?</i>

533
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:30,918
<i>(Mann) Of course we sent royalties.</i>
<i>We sent royalties to A&M Records.</i>

534
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:33,295
<i>I remember the label. It was A&M Sussex.</i>

535
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:36,298
<i>Whether they had a partnership,</i>
<i>whatever they had, I don't... You know.</i>

536
00:34:36,925 --> 00:34:41,136
So, my suggestion is, if you
can find out whoever the person was

537
00:34:41,221 --> 00:34:42,888
who owned Sussex Records,

538
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,391
then you will find out
what happened to the money.

539
00:34:46,476 --> 00:34:49,186
<i>(male interviewer)</i>
<i>Because it's weird, isn't it?</i>

540
00:34:49,312 --> 00:34:52,439
<i>(Mann) It's very strange. Very strange.</i>

541
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:54,733
<i>(male interviewer)</i> How popular
was the album? Was he as famous as,

542
00:34:54,776 --> 00:34:56,944
you know,
the Rolling Stones and the Doors?

543
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,821
Oh, it was much bigger
than Rolling Stones.

544
00:34:58,905 --> 00:35:00,364
Absolutely, at the time, yeah.

545
00:35:00,907 --> 00:35:03,784
<i>(male interviewer) When you released</i>
<i>the record, did you try to contact him?</i>

546
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:07,663
<i>(Harris)</i> No, not at all. You know?
Because... because, at the time,

547
00:35:07,747 --> 00:35:11,750
the legend... the legend was...
here was an artist.

548
00:35:11,793 --> 00:35:13,710
This was like Jimi Hendrix.

549
00:35:13,753 --> 00:35:16,463
With Jimi Hendrix catalogues,
you've gotta understand,

550
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:21,969
if you just got Jimi Hendrix and you'd
got the licence for this territory,

551
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:25,472
you're obviously not gonna go try get
hold of Jimi Hendrix, because he's dead.

552
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:28,475
-But who did you pay royalties to?
-To Sussex Music.

553
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,935
To Clarence?

554
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:33,272
Yes. Well, to Sussex Music
which is his company, yeah.

555
00:35:33,606 --> 00:35:35,566
So, I decided to make a diagram.

556
00:35:35,608 --> 00:35:38,819
Write down the whole path
and trail that I was trying to work out.

557
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,572
All the various touch points,
all the record companies,

558
00:35:41,656 --> 00:35:45,075
all the people that had dealings with
Rodriguez and his album at some point.

559
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,077
<i>I made this whole document.</i>

560
00:35:47,162 --> 00:35:49,746
<i>So I found out there were three</i>
<i>record companies in South Africa</i>

561
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:52,291
<i>that had released Rodriguez's records.</i>

562
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:56,044
<i>Finally discovering that</i>
<i>led to a record company in America.</i>

563
00:35:56,129 --> 00:35:57,921
<i>It was a company that</i>
<i>had been signing Rodriguez</i>

564
00:35:58,006 --> 00:36:00,841
<i>and creating his first album</i>
<i>called Sussex.</i>

565
00:36:01,676 --> 00:36:03,719
<i>I then did my research on Sussex.</i>

566
00:36:03,803 --> 00:36:05,971
<i>That led me to discovering</i>

567
00:36:06,055 --> 00:36:10,475
<i>who the owner of Sussex Records was:</i>
<i>Clarence Avant.</i>

568
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,811
<i>Clarence Avant,</i>
<i>he'd been the head of Motown,</i>

569
00:36:12,854 --> 00:36:16,481
<i>one of the most prestigious jobs</i>
<i>to have in the record company industry.</i>

570
00:36:16,566 --> 00:36:20,277
So I did my research. I tried everything
to get a hold of Clarence Avant,

571
00:36:20,403 --> 00:36:23,822
but I just got to a lot of closed doors.
I could not get a hold of him.

572
00:36:36,044 --> 00:36:39,296
<i>(male interviewer)</i> I don't know
if you've ever seen this picture.

573
00:36:39,422 --> 00:36:42,049
(chuckles) That's him.

574
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,053
That's Rodriguez.

575
00:36:47,597 --> 00:36:49,890
I don't know when this was made.
I have absolutely no idea.

576
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,893
-That's 1970, I think.
-Yeah.

577
00:36:55,271 --> 00:36:57,189
This is my man.

578
00:37:01,361 --> 00:37:03,862
Man, don't get me emotional again. Shit.

579
00:37:03,905 --> 00:37:05,322
You made me emotional once.

580
00:37:05,448 --> 00:37:08,909
I ain't getting emotional no more
sitting here talking to you, man.

581
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:14,790
<i>If I had to name ten artists</i>
<i>that I have ever been involved with,</i>

582
00:37:14,874 --> 00:37:17,626
<i>Rodriguez would be in the top five,</i>
<i>simple as that.</i>

583
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,753
<i>There's nothing...</i>
<i>You never heard anything like him.</i>

584
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:23,215
<i>People would say, ''Well, Bob Dylan.''</i>
<i>I said, ''No, no''.</i>

585
00:37:23,299 --> 00:37:27,636
<i>Bob Dylan was mild to this guy.</i>
<i>Did it make any money?</i>

586
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,972
We judge singing here in America...

587
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:33,517
If you say,
''Is it... Was it the top hundred?

588
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:37,771
''Was it... was it number...
Did it get on the charts as number 12?

589
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:41,275
''Was there a lot of radio play?''
The answer's, ''No, man.''

590
00:37:42,652 --> 00:37:44,861
Nobody didn't... Rodriguez?

591
00:37:46,114 --> 00:37:48,699
You know, that name didn't register.

592
00:37:49,492 --> 00:37:52,369
Although he looked like he was
a white guy but, even still, Rodriguez,

593
00:37:52,495 --> 00:37:55,372
everybody knew Rodriguez,
that's a Spanish name.

594
00:37:55,498 --> 00:37:58,292
A Latin name.
Latin music was not happening then.

595
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,877
<i>(male interviewer)</i> How many records
do you think he sold in America?

596
00:38:00,962 --> 00:38:03,171
In America? Six.

597
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,299
Maybe my wife bought it,
maybe my daughter bought...

598
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:09,011
She couldn't buy it, but maybe
Neil Bogart, maybe Dennis and Mike.

599
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:13,390
Hey, look, man, you know,
it didn't sell here.

600
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,893
<i>There was some excitement about him.</i>

601
00:38:16,978 --> 00:38:21,356
<i>Couple of agents heard him</i>
<i>and wanted to bring him to California</i>

602
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:24,568
<i>and, you know, when he came</i>
<i>to California he was nervous,</i>

603
00:38:24,694 --> 00:38:26,737
<i>and he turned his back to the audience</i>

604
00:38:26,863 --> 00:38:29,031
<i>and everybody said,</i>
<i>''Well, what the hell is this?''</i>

605
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:30,574
<i>(male interviewer)</i>
<i>But the thing is that the guy sold</i>

606
00:38:30,658 --> 00:38:33,410
<i>hundreds of thousands of records</i>
<i>in another country.</i>

607
00:38:33,536 --> 00:38:35,746
<i>(Avant) I'm going to South Africa to try</i>
<i>to chase somebody who's selling records?</i>

608
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,205
<i>Shit, no, man.</i>

609
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,916
<i>(male interviewer) But did you know</i>
<i>that he was big in South Africa?</i>

610
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:44,921
Rodriguez, young man, never happened
insofar as I'm concerned.

611
00:38:45,048 --> 00:38:46,423
Period.

612
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:50,844
But if I'm really gonna try to track
down the money, how should I do it?

613
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:53,430
Well, is that important, the money?
Or is Rod...

614
00:38:53,556 --> 00:38:58,935
Which is important? Rodriguez's story
or you worrying about the money?

615
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,604
How many people in South Africa?

616
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:03,440
40 million? 40 thousand?
40 million people? How many people?

617
00:39:03,566 --> 00:39:05,025
40 million people live in South Africa.

618
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:08,737
Well, so they've been freed
for how long? Three hours?

619
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,238
So what the fuck's
that supposed to mean?

620
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,949
You told me at lunch,
they scratch records

621
00:39:13,076 --> 00:39:14,701
because they wouldn't let the lyrics...

622
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:18,288
So the underground movement,
how big was it? How big was it?

623
00:39:18,414 --> 00:39:20,957
<i>(male interviewer)</i> He sold
half a million records in South Africa.

624
00:39:21,084 --> 00:39:22,876
So he sold half a million records.
So what?

625
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,711
I don't know who he sold them to.

626
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:27,631
How many distributors did he have?
I have no idea.

627
00:39:27,715 --> 00:39:29,216
There are only...
There are three record labels.

628
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,134
-I spoke to all the record label...
-Well, great.

629
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:35,972
...bosses in South Africa who
has released his records. It was...

630
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,725
Go back to 'em and tell 'em
to send me an account.

631
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,228
You think it's something
I'm gonna worry about, a 1970 contract?

632
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,980
If you do,
you're outta your goddamn mind.

633
00:39:44,107 --> 00:39:47,818
Buddha Records out of business.
I'm out of business.

634
00:39:48,945 --> 00:39:53,156
So you think they give a shit
about that? I know I wouldn't.

635
00:39:55,785 --> 00:39:57,160
<i>(Segerman)</i>

637

640

<i>But there was nothing.</i>

641
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,678
<i>At that stage I met Craig,</i>

642
00:40:14,762 --> 00:40:18,014

645

<i>But unfortunately we had very little.</i>

647
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:33,280
<i>And at that stage I remember we felt</i>

648
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:34,865
<i>(Bartholomew-Strydom)</i>
<i>So basically I was lost.</i>

649
00:40:34,991 --> 00:40:36,658
<i>I'd come to a dead end.</i>
<i>I couldn't find him.</i>

650
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:38,285
<i>I didn't know where to look any more.</i>

651
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,704
<i>I'd even visited the places</i>
<i>that he sang about.</i>

652
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,831
<i>I'd been to London. Nothing.</i>

653
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:47,043
<i>I'd been to Amsterdam.</i>
<i>He sings about Amsterdam. Nothing.</i>

654
00:40:47,128 --> 00:40:49,963
<i>And one day I'd basically given up.</i>
<i>I thought, ''Well, this is it.''</i>

655
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:52,883
And one day, just by accident,
I was listening to the album in the car

656
00:40:53,009 --> 00:40:55,051
and I heard the song <i>Inner City Blues</i>.

657
00:40:55,136 --> 00:40:57,304
<i>Great song. And the line came up.</i>

658
00:40:57,388 --> 00:41:01,141
<i>''I met a girl in Dearborn,</i>
<i>early six o'clock this morn.</i>

659
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,726
<i>''A cold fact.''</i>

660
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:05,812
<i>Then I thought, ''Hang on a minute.''</i>
<i>I'd never checked out Dearborn.</i>

661
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:07,814
<i>I didn't even know if it was a city</i>
<i>but then I thought,</i>

662
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:09,733
<i>''Actually that sounds</i>
<i>like a town or a city.''</i>

663
00:41:09,817 --> 00:41:13,528
And I thought, ''Hang on,
let me check it out in an atlas.''

664
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:18,700
So I went through to my old atlas
and pulled it out.

665
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:22,078
I thought, ''Let me see
what I could find here.

666
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,581
''Let me see if I could find Dearborn.''

667
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:26,416
Um... Dear...

668
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:31,379
Then I found it.
Dearborn, Wayne, Michigan. F7.

669
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:37,594
F...7.

670
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:42,766
Dearborn. Part of Detroit.
That was a huge breakthrough in my mind.

671
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:47,521
Detroit, home of Motown,
Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder,

672
00:41:48,189 --> 00:41:51,107
and, eventually, Mike Theodore,
the producer of the album.

673
00:41:55,947 --> 00:42:00,116
<i>(Theodore) I was sitting in my condo,</i>
<i>just having a cup of coffee.</i>

674
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:04,120
<i>I was looking out the window</i>
<i>watching the ocean. Phone rings.</i>

675
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:06,915
It's a long-distance call

676
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:08,625
from South Africa...

677
00:42:10,044 --> 00:42:13,088
from a writer whose name's
Craig Bartholomew,

678
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:19,094
and he starts telling me
this amazing story.

679
00:42:20,263 --> 00:42:22,097
<i>So he said, ''Do you know that Rodriguez</i>

680
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:25,100
<i>''has been selling in South Africa</i>
<i>for 25 years.</i>

681
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:27,561
<i>''His albums are selling millions.''</i>

682
00:42:27,895 --> 00:42:29,563
<i>I said, ''What?''</i>

683
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:33,483
<i>Then he's sitting there and he wants...</i>
<i>he starts telling me some stories.</i>

684
00:42:33,568 --> 00:42:35,652
He said, ''How did Rodriguez die?''

685
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,990
And he's telling me information
that he had that Rodriguez had...

686
00:42:41,242 --> 00:42:43,159
blown his brains out on stage,

687
00:42:43,244 --> 00:42:45,495
or set himself on fire
and killed himself.

688
00:42:45,955 --> 00:42:48,039
I had 100 questions I wanted to ask.

689
00:42:48,124 --> 00:42:51,793
I was just hoping I could get
all my questions in, you know.

690
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:54,421
''Why did he write this lyric?
Why did he write that lyric?

691
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:58,592
''Where did he record this album?
Where did he record that album?''

692
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:02,470
And we got talking and I asked him
a lot of questions and it was amazing.

693
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:05,473
It was a rollercoaster ride
of questions and answers,

694
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:08,852
and it was a euphoric moment
of just having finally broken through

695
00:43:08,978 --> 00:43:10,353
and discovered something.

696
00:43:10,396 --> 00:43:14,357
And finally I got to the one question
I wanted to know the answer of, was,

697
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,570
''How did Rodriguez die?
Did he blow himself up on stage? Or...

698
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:21,197
''What is this dramatic story?

699
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,869
''Let's open up the lid on this
right away, and find out what happened.''

700
00:43:25,911 --> 00:43:30,707
And Mike Theodore said,
''What do you mean dead? He's not dead.

701
00:43:32,668 --> 00:43:34,919
''Sixto is alive. He's alive and kicking.

702
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:40,717
''The principal artist known as
Sixto Rodriguez is alive and kicking

703
00:43:40,843 --> 00:43:42,218
''and living in Detroit.''

704
00:43:46,349 --> 00:43:49,517
<i>(Harris) I... I can't remember who</i>
<i>called me and said, ''They've found him.''</i>

705
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:55,231
I said, ''No. You're shitting me.
This isn't... No.'' (laughs)

706
00:43:55,858 --> 00:44:00,111
<i>At first I thought it was a hoax.</i>
<i>I thought somebody was faking it.</i>

707
00:44:01,364 --> 00:44:04,741
You know, it's like going
into Tutankhamen's tomb

708
00:44:04,867 --> 00:44:06,242
and finding the mummy.

709
00:44:06,369 --> 00:44:07,744
You know, it was like, ''Wow, he lives.''

710
00:44:07,912 --> 00:44:11,289
I remember dancing on the spot
when I was staying on the phone.

711
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:15,251
And Craig and I were jumping up and down
saying, ''We found him, we found him.''

712
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:17,754
It was the most exciting thing.
We'd actually done it.

725
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,802
many people involved,

726
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:10,640
but somehow this article
made its way across the Atlantic

727
00:45:10,766 --> 00:45:13,101
and into the hands
of someone in America.

728
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:15,937
And what I thought was the end of story

729
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,648
was actually just the beginning
of another story,

730
00:45:18,691 --> 00:45:21,317
and the best part was still to come.

731
00:45:23,612 --> 00:45:26,156
'Cause I don't know where it is.
It might take a while.

732
00:45:26,198 --> 00:45:28,283
They do have the dates.

733
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:31,202
''Three-year search for dead singer.''
Yes.

734
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:34,622
August '97. I was in Kansas.

735
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:38,501
I got a copy of it to me at work.
I was on, like, a 24-hour shift.

736
00:45:38,627 --> 00:45:40,837
And then, I went online

737
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:45,175
and that's when
I discovered the website.

738
00:45:45,301 --> 00:45:49,053
When I went online there was
this milk carton with a picture.

739
00:45:49,805 --> 00:45:54,726
And it said, ''Wanted''
and ''Have you seen this man?''

740
00:45:55,394 --> 00:45:58,354
I was like, ''Matter of fact,
I have seen him before.''

741
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:04,402
I replied, ''Rodriguez is my father.
I'm serious.

742
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:07,655
''Do you really want to know
about my father?

743
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:11,367
''Sometimes the fantasy
is better left alive.''

744
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:13,495
I don't know why I said that,
but anyway I did.

745
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:17,332
And then I gave them e-mail address,
phone numbers,

746
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:20,710
anything that they wanted to contact me.
And he phoned me.

747
00:46:26,342 --> 00:46:28,384
<i>(Segerman) Well, we'd found out</i>
<i>that Rodriguez was alive.</i>

748
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:29,844
<i>I'd spoken to Craig.</i>

749
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,680
I came to work and Alex McCrindle,

750
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:34,724
who was the guy I worked
on the website with said,

751
00:46:34,767 --> 00:46:38,186
''You're not going to believe
what's on the website.''

752
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:41,898
And on the website was a forum
where people could post messages,

753
00:46:42,024 --> 00:46:43,525
and there was a message that said,

754
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:46,236
''My name's Eva.
I'm Rodriguez's daughter.''

755
00:46:46,362 --> 00:46:47,737
<i>She'd left a phone number and she said,</i>

756
00:46:47,863 --> 00:46:49,113
<i>''I'd like to speak to someone</i>

757
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,532
<i>in connection with this.''</i>

758
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,784
<i>So that night I phoned her.</i>

759
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,453
I said, ''Hi, I'm Sugar,''
and she said, ''I'm Eva,''

760
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:58,039
and we had the most
amazing conversation.

761
00:46:58,082 --> 00:47:02,252
She explained to me who her father was,
what he had done, where he had been.

762
00:47:02,378 --> 00:47:05,880
She asked me who I was
and I explained why my name was Sugar

763
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:08,383
and how I was involved with the website.

764
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:10,593
<i>And then at the end I said to her,</i>

765
00:47:10,636 --> 00:47:13,054
<i>''This has been the most</i>
<i>amazing thing for me,</i>

766
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:14,889
<i>''and what would be really great</i>
<i>is if I could,</i>

767
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:16,766
<i>''at some point, speak to your dad.</i>

768
00:47:16,892 --> 00:47:18,768
<i>''I'd love it if I could</i>
<i>just say hello to him.''</i>

769
00:47:18,811 --> 00:47:21,437
<i>Because, for me,</i>
<i>this was sort of the end of the search</i>

770
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,439
<i>and I just wanted to speak to this man.</i>

771
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,400
And then I went to bed.

772
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:28,653
And 1:00 in the morning that night,
the phone rang.

773
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:33,116
And my wife answers it
'cause it was her side of the bed.

774
00:47:33,242 --> 00:47:37,745
And I remember she picked up the phone
and her face just changed.

775
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:41,958
She had this look of awe.
She said, ''It's him.''

776
00:47:42,084 --> 00:47:44,127
And I was in shock. I'd been sleeping

777
00:47:44,253 --> 00:47:47,297
and I ran into the other room,
into my study,

778
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:49,841
and I picked up the phone
and she put hers down.

779
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:52,510
And I said, ''Hello?'' and a voice said...

780
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:54,470
<i>(Rodriguez's voice on phone)</i>
<i>''Hello, is that Sugar?''</i>

781
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:58,266
And I knew, I just knew,
because I knew that voice.

782
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:01,936
I'd heard that voice so many times
on the records, I knew it was him.

783
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:03,813
I was talking to Rodriguez.

784
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:08,151
<i>That, for me, was one of</i>
<i>the greatest moments of my life.</i>

785
00:49:17,388 --> 00:49:20,974
<i>-(Rodriguez) Whenever you're ready.</i>
<i>-(male interviewer) Okay.</i>

786
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,226
<i>(Rodriguez) Is this all right?</i>
<i>Should I be doing something though?</i>

787
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:26,604
<i>Should I have a glass of water</i>
<i>or something? Is that right?</i>

788
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,941
<i>-(male interviewer)</i> Do you want?
-Yeah. I like that.

789
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:32,819
Yeah, this is...
I'm supposed to be comfortable.

790
00:49:42,997 --> 00:49:47,083
So run the question to me again.
Just so I can hear it in my head.

791
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:52,630
In the '70s and '80s, did you ever
get any contact from South Africa?

792
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:55,174
Uh... No, I didn't.

793
00:49:57,177 --> 00:50:01,305
Maybe they didn't have a contact number
or something but, no, I didn't.

794
00:50:01,432 --> 00:50:03,599
How does that feel?
You weren't aware of something

795
00:50:03,684 --> 00:50:05,810
that would have changed
your life completely.

796
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:08,271
I mean, probably to the better.

797
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:11,441
Well, I don't know if it would have been
for the better,

798
00:50:11,525 --> 00:50:14,777
but it's certainly a thought, you know.

799
00:50:15,654 --> 00:50:19,365
But wouldn't it have been nice to know
that you were a superstar?

800
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:20,825
Uh, well...

801
00:50:25,539 --> 00:50:27,957
I don't know how to respond to that.

802
00:50:28,042 --> 00:50:32,336
After <i>Coming From Reality,</i>
did you wanna continue making albums?

803
00:50:32,463 --> 00:50:36,299
I would have liked to have continued
but nothing beats <i>Reality</i>.

804
00:50:36,341 --> 00:50:38,801
So I pretty much went back to work.

805
00:50:39,678 --> 00:50:41,137
What did you do?

806
00:50:41,221 --> 00:50:44,140
I... Well, I'd do hired labour.

807
00:50:44,308 --> 00:50:48,227
Demolition, renovation of buildings,

808
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:53,066
of homes, you know. Restoration.

809
00:50:54,485 --> 00:50:55,818
Did you enjoy that?

810
00:50:55,903 --> 00:51:00,656
I do. (stammering) It keeps the blood
circulating, keeps you fit, yeah.

811
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:03,493
But it's quite far away from music.

812
00:51:03,535 --> 00:51:07,413
Uh... Yeah, quite a bit,
quite a different contrast, yeah.

813
00:51:07,498 --> 00:51:09,874
Did you continue
making music on your own?

814
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,377
I do, I play guitar.
I love playing guitar.

815
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:17,507
But I do love to listen.
I like to go see the shows and things.

816

875
00:55:33,513 --> 00:55:36,223
And my father's family is Mexican.

876
00:55:36,308 --> 00:55:38,893
My grandfather came from Mexico.

877
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:43,147
<i>The Mexican came to Detroit</i>
<i>to work in the auto factories,</i>

878
00:55:43,231 --> 00:55:48,903

<i>blue-collar workers, hard labour.</i>

879

<i>Um, we lived in 26 different homes</i>
<i>and some houses didn't have bedrooms.</i>

880
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,370
<i>Some houses didn't have bathrooms.</i>

881
00:55:57,954 --> 00:56:02,083
<i>And they weren't homes.</i>
<i>They were just places that we lived.</i>

882
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:06,462
But just because people are poor
or have little

883
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:10,383
doesn't mean that, you know,
their dreams aren't big

884
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:13,636
and their soul isn't rich, you know,

885
00:56:14,179 --> 00:56:18,099
and that's where the classes

is that there is a difference

and the thing is,
it was a family guitar,

934
01:00:01,948 --> 01:00:07,036
and I played a lot of bars in the city
and clubs in the city, small rooms.

935
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:11,457
And I met Mike Theodore

936
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:14,043
and they came to the club
to see me play.

937
01:00:14,169 --> 01:00:18,047
I had a gig at a place called The Sewer,

right out by the Detroit River,

939

''but Rodriguez is coming to South Africa

1013
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:43,437
''and we can be the opening band.

1014
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:47,107
''Do you wanna do it?''
I said, ''Of course we wanna do it.''

1015
01:04:48,443 --> 01:04:51,486
''Why? Where is he?''
''Now they found him.

1016
01:04:51,613 --> 01:04:55,115
''They found him, he's alive, he's gonna
come and tour in South Africa.''

1017
01:04:55,158 --> 01:04:59,328
''Are we gonna be the opening band?''
So I couldn't really believe this.

1018
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:05,459
And then I got all the information:
he's living in Detroit and everything.

1019
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:07,169
And then a little while later he said,

1020
01:05:07,211 --> 01:05:09,838
''Look, it turns out
he hasn't got a band.

1021
01:05:09,964 --> 01:05:13,508
''Could we be the support band?''
I mean his band.

1022
01:05:14,469 --> 01:05:18,013
I remember, even then, we were sort of,

1023
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:21,350
''Is this really gonna be Rodriguez?''

1024
01:05:21,392 --> 01:05:24,019
We'll only know
if he can actually sing these songs.

1025
01:05:24,145 --> 01:05:27,397
I mean, we don't know.
What if it's just some guy? (chuckles)

1028
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,653

1029
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:35,864
<i>trying to believe our eyes,</i>

1030
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:38,867
<i>thinking it was just all very shocking.</i>

1031
01:05:38,993 --> 01:05:41,161
<i>I don't know, he took to it really easy.</i>

1032
01:05:41,204 --> 01:05:43,538
<i>He just walked in and did his thing</i>

1033
01:05:43,581 --> 01:05:47,167
<i>and I was amazed that he did so well.</i>

1034
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:48,210
<i>But he's not all</i>

1035
01:05:48,336 --> 01:05:49,378
<i>''head in the clouds'' kinda guy.</i>

1036
01:05:49,504 --> 01:05:53,215
<i>He's a little bit too much grounded.</i>

1037
01:05:53,299 --> 01:05:54,883
<i>He didn't take advantage</i>

1038
01:05:54,926 --> 01:05:57,052
<i>of all the amenities and stuff.</i>

1039
01:05:57,136 --> 01:05:59,888
He didn't sleep in the big
double king size bed.

1040
01:05:59,931 --> 01:06:03,725
He kinda curled up on the love seat
and I found him there and...

1041
01:06:03,768 --> 01:06:07,229
Yeah, he just didn't think somebody
should have to make another bed

1042
01:06:07,271 --> 01:06:09,231
because he messed it up or...

1043
01:06:09,273 --> 01:06:10,649
<i>(Regan) There was a time</i>

1044
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:12,776
<i>where I stayed in the house we were at</i>

1045
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:15,404
<i>and everyone else had gone out.</i>

1046
01:06:15,488 --> 01:06:17,114
<i>The phone rang and it kept ringing,</i>

1047
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,324
<i>so I decided to answer it.</i>

1048
01:06:19,409 --> 01:06:20,784
And it was a reporter

1049
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:22,744
looking to speak with Rodriguez

1050
01:06:22,829 --> 01:06:25,789
and set up time for an interview.

1051
01:06:26,499 --> 01:06:31,253
And then, before she hung up,
after I told her to call back later

1052
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:33,672
to talk to someone
'cause I couldn't help her,

1053
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:38,343
she told me that she wanted to know,
between she and I,

1054
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:40,345
if it was the real Rodriguez.

1055
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:41,930
(indistinct chatter)

1056

<i>(Möller)</i> We were rehearsing with a CD

1057
01:06:45,309 --> 01:06:47,477
of the songs that we've got

1058
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,937
in the studio here in Cape Town

1059
01:06:49,022 --> 01:06:52,441
on the day that he came
from the airport, when he arrived,

1060
01:06:52,483 --> 01:06:56,153
and we were actually in the middle
of a song when he walked in

1061
01:06:56,279 --> 01:06:58,947
and just took over the microphone
and finished the song.

1062
01:06:59,032 --> 01:07:01,450
We switched off the CD player

1063
01:07:01,492 --> 01:07:04,286
and it was, like, completely seamless.

1064
01:07:04,328 --> 01:07:05,704
<i>Completely seamless.</i>

1065

But it turned out really,
really different than that.

1075
01:07:47,205 --> 01:07:49,998
And there's old people and young people

1076

1164
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,472

1165
01:14:20,598 --> 01:14:25,602
Maybe that was OK as well
because he preserved his mystery.

1166
01:14:25,686 --> 01:14:27,729
I walked away
from that interview saying,

1167
01:14:28,022 --> 01:14:30,690
''This is all too strange to be true.''

1168
01:14:30,774 --> 01:14:33,401
<i>It remains too strange to be true.</i>

1169
01:14:33,486 --> 01:14:34,736
<i>''These are the days</i>

1170

1171
01:14:36,447 --> 01:14:37,989

1172
01:14:58,886 --> 01:15:01,137
<i>(Rodriguez) Oh, they were so sweet.</i>

1173
01:15:01,222 --> 01:15:03,389
<i>I didn't believe it.</i>

1174
01:15:03,474 --> 01:15:06,226
<i>And I still don't, but the thing is...</i>

1175
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:11,981
So when I went on stage
5,000 seats all set up,

1176
01:15:12,024 --> 01:15:14,359
white seats, and the thing is...

1177
01:15:14,693 --> 01:15:17,278
And I said, ''This is...''

1178
01:15:18,572 --> 01:15:23,201
<i>So when I played a show, they jumped</i>
<i>out of their seats and rushed the stage.</i>

1179
01:15:24,912 --> 01:15:29,082
<i>South Africa made me feel like</i>
<i>more than a prince.</i>

1180
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:33,044
<i>(Eva) And then signing the autographs</i>
<i>for, like, a couple of hours.</i>

1181
01:15:33,087 --> 01:15:37,298
<i>I mean, just the line of people</i>
<i>bringing their guitars to be signed,</i>

1182
01:15:37,383 --> 01:15:39,425
<i>bringing their CDs and...</i>

1183
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:40,969
<i>(Regan) The most amazing thing I'd seen</i>

1184
01:15:41,053 --> 01:15:43,930
<i>was the man with his tattoo</i>
<i>of the</i> Cold Fact.

1185
01:15:44,014 --> 01:15:48,101
<i>He was a Rodriguez impersonator.</i>

1186
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:51,229
<i>I was like,</i>
<i>''Man, that is just too crazy.''</i>

1187
01:15:54,108 --> 01:15:56,317
I have with me here,
presented to Rodriguez

1188
01:15:56,402 --> 01:15:58,319
for sales of the album <i>Cold Fact</i>.

1189
01:15:58,445 --> 01:16:00,321
(whooping and cheering)

1190
01:16:04,285 --> 01:16:06,119
Now just tell the States that,
OK, will you?

1191
01:16:06,161 --> 01:16:07,620
(all laughing)

1192
01:16:07,746 --> 01:16:11,958
American singer Rodriguez
is certainly alive and well

1193
01:16:12,001 --> 01:16:14,335
and with us in the Front Row tonight.
Welcome.

1194
01:16:14,461 --> 01:16:15,920
Very kind. How are you?

1195
01:16:16,005 --> 01:16:18,923
I've heard some really riveting tales
about your ''death.''

1196
01:16:19,008 --> 01:16:22,010
I mean, they range from you pouring
petrol all over yourself on stage

1197
01:16:22,094 --> 01:16:27,098
and committing suicide to taking
a drug overdose and dying in prison.

1198
01:16:37,276 --> 01:16:42,989
<i>(Eva) Yeah, it was a beautiful,</i>
<i>beautiful dream</i>

1199
01:16:44,992 --> 01:16:47,702
<i>and then you gotta go back. (laughs)</i>

1200
01:16:47,828 --> 01:16:50,455
My dad said he's got two lives.

1201
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:55,710
The carriage turns into the pumpkin bus
or something. It's like...

1202
01:16:55,836 --> 01:16:58,212
<i>(male interviewer)</i>
Did people in Detroit believe you

1203
01:16:58,297 --> 01:17:01,341
when you came back
and told them what had happened?

1204
01:17:01,383 --> 01:17:05,511
You know, people in Detroit
need to hear something good.

1205
01:17:06,347 --> 01:17:08,348
<i>I'm not sure how much of it</i>
<i>they believed</i>

1206
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:10,892
<i>because it is a grandiose story.</i>

1207
01:17:12,061 --> 01:17:13,645
It sounds like something
you would make up

1208
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:16,981
if you were bragging on some dream
or something.

1209
01:17:18,067 --> 01:17:20,485
<i>(Ferretti) He was really quite famous.</i>

1210
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:23,237
<i>He'd be, you know,</i>
<i>tearing down this old shack</i>

1211
01:17:23,322 --> 01:17:26,866
<i>or he'd be sweeping up filth or dirt</i>

1212
01:17:26,909 --> 01:17:30,078
<i>and he started to show me one day,</i>
<i>and I didn't believe him,</i>

1213
01:17:30,162 --> 01:17:33,998
<i>about the album</i>
<i>and how it got to be so popular.</i>

1214
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:35,750
Somebody had a bootleg copy
of this thing

1215
01:17:35,876 --> 01:17:37,919
and it spread around and everyone...

1216
01:17:38,003 --> 01:17:42,674
It got to be so popular
that children could recite it

1217
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:47,095
and sing the song word for word...
all of the songs word for word.

1218
01:17:47,179 --> 01:17:50,598
And I had never heard of the album
and I said, ''Can you get me an album?''

1219
01:17:50,683 --> 01:17:52,100
And he couldn't even get me one.

1220
01:17:52,184 --> 01:17:55,019
I mean, that's how
obscure of a thing it was.

1221
01:17:55,104 --> 01:18:00,066
But he had all these photos and stuff,
with these giant crowds,

1222
01:18:00,109 --> 01:18:03,111
20,000 people,
like Woodstock or something.

1223
01:18:03,195 --> 01:18:04,779
Like, ''Are you kidding me? That's you?''

1224
01:18:06,115 --> 01:18:09,117
<i>I thought it was Photoshopped</i>
<i>or something. I didn't believe him.</i>

1225
01:18:09,201 --> 01:18:12,870
<i>But he had all these giant crowds</i>
<i>and he was quite content</i>

1226
01:18:12,955 --> 01:18:16,582
<i>to just go and sweep up people's lawns</i>

1227
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:20,628
<i>or clean up and do manual labour.</i>
<i>He stayed.</i>

1228
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:27,135
He lives a very, very, very modest life.

1229
01:18:29,054 --> 01:18:30,430
<i>Definitely.</i>

1230
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:33,307
<i>There's definitely no excess,</i>

1231
01:18:34,768 --> 01:18:39,897
<i>and he definitely still works hard</i>
<i>in order to make ends meet.</i>

1232
01:18:40,607 --> 01:18:46,446
<i>And there's no glamour to his life</i>
<i>in that sense.</i>

1233
01:18:46,488 --> 01:18:49,115
<i>(male interviewer)</i>
<i>But he must be a rich man today?</i>

1234
01:18:49,158 --> 01:18:51,325
<i>(Regan) No.</i>

1235
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:55,329
<i>Rich in a lot of things</i>
<i>but perhaps not material things.</i>

1236
01:18:55,414 --> 01:18:57,749
<i>I guess it just never got to that.</i>

1237
01:18:57,833 --> 01:18:59,417
<i>(male interviewer) But he's sold</i>
<i>hundreds of thousands of records</i>

1238
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:00,960
<i>in South Africa.</i>

1239
01:19:01,003 --> 01:19:02,420
Well, yes.

1240
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:07,300
But I believe there's a great deal
of perhaps bootlegging,

1241
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:11,721
piracy, such like that. Perhaps...

1242
01:19:12,973 --> 01:19:15,183
Perhaps other people are rich.
