Andy-Andersen aka LilleBuh made this awesome sub.
Please enjoy.

3
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,210
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were hungry

4
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,370
Crazy me

5
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,730
Goodbye

6
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,410
Where is your sister?

7
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,390
OK, ignore me

8
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:22,240
If this window is staying open for the length of a coffee
and then you're stuck outside for the rest of the day.

9
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,890
I'm serious

10
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,330
- Mr. Spiegelman
- Madame Gauthier

11
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,920
- In the flesh

12
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,590
- Nice to meet you

13
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,290
- The apartment is on the fourth floor.
I did explain that, didn't I?

14
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,320
- Yeah, you did.
You did definitely.

15
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,420
Well...

16
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,240
I think I should be fine

17
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,220
- If you say so

18
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,430
- You're welcome

19
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,330
My pleasure

20
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,200
Love having a cold apartment

21
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,300
Oh, I can't stay mad at you guys

22
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,720
Spencer, you up?

23
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,260
- Coming

24
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,770
- Speak English?
- Yeah

25
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,280
- Hi

26
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,260
- That's yesterday's.
But there is nothing about the killer

27
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,900
- Did you do the crossword?

28
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,400
- Do I ever?

29
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,240
- Hey
- Hi

30
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,000
- I'm moving in upstairs.
Apartment number twelve

31
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,650
- Thank God.
I thought you were delivering pillows

32
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,290
- That would be a weird job

33
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,200
So cool you guys both are English

34
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,210
Sorry, I'm rude. I'm Victor.
Nice to meet you

35
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,300
- Spencer

36
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,460
Louise

37
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,280
- Nice to meet you

38
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,880
- OK, bye

39
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,260
- And there she goes

40
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,960
- Well, that's the luck with the move there, man.
I'd offer to give you a hand but...

41
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,080
I'm lazy

42
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,290
- No, what? No, no, no...
I have a brother coming in from Ottawa...

43
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,770
- I was kidding, Vince
- Yeah...

44
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,060
OK

45
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,840
- And he is tall.
Which you know I love

46
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,380
For me the perfect type is when you can slow-dance
and you can rest your head right on his chest

47
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,230
I mean how fucking hot is that, right?

48
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,660
- Pretty hot

49
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,240
And I never meet guys that tall and blond.

50
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,810
Which is nuts

51
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:13,666
I totally thought blond guys were like a myth.
I mean, I never see blond guys anywhere, do you?

52
00:06:13,778 --> 00:06:15,257
Oh, and his body...

53
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:19,175
I know his has an amazing body because at one point
I leaned over and I touched his arm,

54
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:24,419
and I swear to God he had like,
armor on underneath his t-shirt or something.

55
00:06:24,628 --> 00:06:26,043
I know, right.

56
00:06:26,223 --> 00:06:29,573
And his name is Roland.
Which I know you think is probably lame

57
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:31,730
but I think it is kind of sexy.

58
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:36,232
It's like those old British names, you know.
Like he is like the Lord of something, something

59
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:39,965
Anyway he is picking me up after work tonight

60
00:06:40,737 --> 00:06:43,215
- Don't you finish at midnight tonight?

61
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:45,834
- So we are going for a late drink

62
00:06:48,026 --> 00:06:50,094
Whatever I am not gonna sleep with him

63
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,606
- But you will
- But he's hot

64
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,484
- Have you read The Gazette?
Is there anything about the serial killer?

65
00:06:57,064 --> 00:07:00,366
- God, seriously Louise. There is no serial killer.
There is just one dead woman

66
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:03,755
- Three dead and raped

67
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,612
- Whatever

68
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,445
- Are you sure you don't mind?

69
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,937
- No, who cares.
There's no one here anyway

70
00:07:35,453 --> 00:07:36,658
- OK.
'night

71
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:37,633
- 'night

72
00:07:37,677 --> 00:07:40,329
Oh, if you hear from Natalie.
Tell her I'm gonna murder her

73
00:07:40,438 --> 00:07:42,120
- And rape her

74
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,162
- Yes

75
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,438
- So sorry. I'm so sorry.
It's pitch black outside.

76
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:05,210
You're coming home by yourself
and I just leap out and say hey

77
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:10,130
I'm an idiot.
I'm Victor we met this morning

78
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:13,368
I know it is weird that
I'm standing here.

79
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:18,974
But I promise I'm just waiting for my brother to come and help me
because I can't really carry this up to the fourth floor all by myself

80
00:09:19,806 --> 00:09:22,399
I'm so sorry
- Stop apologizing it's fine

81
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:26,713
I've just been reading too much
about the serial killer

82
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,700
- What?

83
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:36,541
- You haven't seen it?
- Oh, wow. This is awful

84
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:37,541
- Yeah. it's fucked

85
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,112
- I had no idea this was happening

86
00:09:39,132 --> 00:09:40,126
- Keep it

87
00:09:40,215 --> 00:09:42,295
- Really, are you sure?
- Positive

88
00:09:42,343 --> 00:09:44,638
- OK.
Thank you

89
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:55,139
- Tough day?

90
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,738
- Have you spoken to the new guy yet?

91
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:12,639
- No, just this morning.
You?

92
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,539
- He is down in the lobby

93
00:10:18,109 --> 00:10:20,907
With a couch he can't move

94
00:10:21,976 --> 00:10:23,999
I feel like I should help him, but...

95
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:27,423
- But what?

96
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:30,987
- But I don't want to

97
00:10:31,686 --> 00:10:33,448
- That's my girl

98
00:10:42,786 --> 00:10:45,948
- OK, I gotta go feed the cats
- OK

99
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,455
Do you wanna eat something in a bit?
- No, bye

100
00:11:00,237 --> 00:11:02,603
- I'm good

101
00:11:13,532 --> 00:11:15,880
Thank you, Louise.

102
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:20,756
You know it's not really heavy for a pull-out.
It just kind'a awkward and cumbersome

103
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:23,082
It's actually my parent's old couch.

104
00:11:23,286 --> 00:11:27,259
Pretty nice of them to give it to me

105
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,751
OK

106
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,940
- OK
- Thank you so much

107
00:11:42,983 --> 00:11:48,033
You are the best neighbor in the history
of neighbors. Thank you so much.

108
00:11:48,947 --> 00:11:50,514
- Don't give it another thought

109
00:11:50,592 --> 00:11:52,160
- No, no. Listen.
I gotta make it up to you.

110
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,944
Let me cook you supper or take you out for supper.
Something like that.

111
00:11:54,955 --> 00:11:56,457
- Sure, when you are settled

112
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:58,784
- OK

113
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,344
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 

114
00:12:06,438 --> 00:12:09,957
It's just stupid people.
Stupid things they want me to do

115
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:26,940
Just tonight

116
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:31,758
And just because you made me
feel so bad for being late

117
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:32,430
- You get stood up?

118
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:36,546
- OK, bye Mr. Chou

119
00:13:36,992 --> 00:13:40,587
- You should date nicer boys

120
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,892
- Hey

121
00:14:01,952 --> 00:14:04,010
- Hey.
How's it going?

122
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:08,981
- Good, good. I still owe you that supper
- Oh, don't worry about it.

123
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:13,570
- I am not worried about it.
I just want to make sure I thank you properly

124
00:14:14,407 --> 00:14:16,442
- OK. Hey
- Hello

125
00:14:16,783 --> 00:14:18,782
- Good morning
- Good morning

126
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,971
Got the newspaper?
- Oh, I didn't work yesterday

127
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,471
- Big night, anybody watching
the results come in tonight?

128
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:30,834
- 'cause I thought maybe we could like.
I don't know

129
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:34,192
Get together, eat food. 
See what happens.

130
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:37,387
Bad idea.
Never mind

131
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,587
- No, sure
- Yeah, let's do it here. I'll cook

132
00:14:41,592 --> 00:14:44,336
- Really?
Amazing. How 'bout I'll bring dessert?

133
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,723
- I'll come sevenish

134
00:14:46,894 --> 00:14:48,941
- Whenever
- OK. Bye

135
00:14:51,894 --> 00:14:54,441
- Man, this is gonna be fun
- It is gonna be a good time

136
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:56,022
Alright I'll see you there

137
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:57,843
- I'll see ya

138
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:12,369
- I'm English

139
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:13,969
Just give me one...

140
00:16:14,869 --> 00:16:18,912
What's going on?
- Johanne

141
00:16:18,925 --> 00:16:20,777
- What about Johanne?

142
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:26,743
- Where did she say that she met him?
- She didn't

143
00:16:26,934 --> 00:16:32,270
I don't know where she goes out.
She lives down town I think

144
00:16:34,634 --> 00:16:38,370
She described him to you, though?
- Yeah, but I was barely listening

145
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:45,634
She said he was blond, muscular.

146
00:16:45,934 --> 00:16:47,634
Tall I think or she thought

147
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:49,634
It really wasn't very specific

148
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,420
- And she said his name was?

149
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,700
- Something stupid sounding

150
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,810
Roland

151
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,940
It was Roland

152
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:09,140
So do you think this is the same guy.
I mean - the serial killer?

153
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,960
- What serial killer?

154
00:17:14,461 --> 00:17:16,160
- Was she raped?

155
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,580
- She was treated poorly

156
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,150
- But does this Roland guy,
does it sound like the same guy you're looking for?

157
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,560
- Louise, right?
- Right

158
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,150
- Louise.
I wanna thank you for your help

159
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:38,970
If you can think of anything else about Johanne.
Anything at all. Call me

160
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,630
My cellular number is on the back

161
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,760
- Mr. Brandt

162
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,290
Should I be worried?

163
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,110
I mean should I be concerned for my safety?

164
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,240
- A woman your age should always be concerned for her safety

165
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,800
It's a nasty world

166
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,110
- I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't even see it

167
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,040
This looks like it will be quite the feast

168
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,270
Fennel.
I love fennel

169
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,600
I forgot to ask you this when we spoke
this morning but there is no dessert.

170
00:18:50,645 --> 00:18:52,190
Should I run out
and get something?

171
00:18:52,191 --> 00:18:53,690
- Company is bringing dessert

172
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,790
- Company...
So mysterious

173
00:18:57,795 --> 00:19:00,990
My most mysterious patient,
that's what I call you.

174
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,910
Now, I know you don't want
me to mention this again

175
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,340
but I have to because I
think it is unconscionable

176
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,320
If you wanna vote it'll take me ten minutes to get the van...
- Thank you, Ms. Van Ilen

177
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,800
- They could win by one vote.
That's what everyone is saying

178
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,800
Ms. Van Ilen.
You make too many assumptions

179
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,250
- Just amazing

180
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,370
You could not ask anything more
from your musculature, young man.

181
00:19:59,380 --> 00:19:60,960
Just amazing

182
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,990
- I'm naturally athletic
- You certainly are

183
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,360
There is no doubt about that

184
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,490
- Hello
- Madame Gauthier, it's Louise

185
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,660
- Oh, hello beautiful
- Hi

186
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,870
Listen, do you know the new guy in the building, Victor?
- Of course I do

187
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,530
- Could I get his number from you?

188
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,150
- And she called you for his number?

189
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,300
So bold

190
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,870
- It's different for girls now

191
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,900
They are much luckier than we were
- I didn't even know there was a new tenant

192
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,930
- He's young
And he's Jewish

193
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,870
I always thought her and Spencer...
- So did I, so did I

194
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,100
- But nothing yet. And now this.
- So sad, for him.

195
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,530
Such a handsome man
- So handsome

196
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,980
- Almost tragic

197
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,670
- So who's he having dinner with?
- He didn't say

198
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,420
I tried but he wouldn't budge.
He's like a vault, that one

199
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,880
Is that, that Valיrie woman?

200
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,210
- Probably
- She's terrible

201
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,700
- She's sad
- She's horrible

202
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,950
- She drinks, so much
- Clearly

203
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,910
- Let you know what I see
- See you soon

204
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,510
- I know it's ridiculous but
it's only a few blocks, so...

205
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:52,010
Anyway, let me know if it's
inconvenient or anything. OK, thanks.

206
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,990
See you at dinner either way

207
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,900
- Hi there
- Hey

208
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,100
- I'm eh... Hey
- Hey

209
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,830
- Am I late?
- No, not at all

210
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,000
You too, OK.

211
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,630
Make sure someone picks you up
- I will

212
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,690
- Sorry about that message by the way
- What, why?

213
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,750
It's, my honor.
My pleasure

214
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,760
Actually I felt terrible that I
hadn't thought of it myself.

215
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:54,890
I mean there is a serial killer
attacking pretty young girls in NDG

216
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:59,900
and you having to walk home by yourself.
That's just crazy

217
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,520
- Well, thanks for that
- Well, yeah

218
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,940
Hey
- Hi

219
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,900
- So, Louise is just up stairs getting ready

220
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,999
- Come on in

221
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,970
So, you teach high school.
Is that it?

222
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:57,520
Well, elementary school actually
- Gotcha

223
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,910
Kind'a like baby-sitting, isn't it?

224
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,870
- Well, yes there is an
element of that to it.

225
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:13,750
But one can make a case that it's the most
important time in one's life learning wise, anyway

226
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:20,530
'Cause technically your brain will never be as open
to sort of new ideas as it is when you are like a little

227
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,330
- I was kidding

228
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,980
- Right, of course

229
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,580
- I'm sure it is really rewarding.
Really

230
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,980
- I love it

231
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,520
I really do
- No, I bet, I bet

232
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:36,420
And what is it. You just came back from...
- China. Northern China

233
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,280
- Wow, that's crazy
- Yeah, it's intense

234
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,330
- Were you doing the same thing there?
- Yeah, pretty much

235
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,930
I guess there is a bit more

236
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,830
- Chinese?

237
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,530
- Yeah, exactly

238
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,730
- But you are from here
originally though, right?

239
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:54,450
- Well, yeah. I was born in Ottawa.
But I grew up here in NDG

240
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:58,140
- Really...
Welcome back to Canada then

241
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,430
I mean for now
- Yeah

242
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,430
You know what. That's an idea,
that's an idea

243
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,930
To Canada

244
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,930
- For now

245
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,320
- I wonder what's taking Louise so long

246
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,220
- She is probably just playing with her pussy

247
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,720
The cat, man. She got two cats
she's obsessed with.

248
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,680
Victor, you can't make it that easy for me

249
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,890
- No promises

250
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,410
Allow me to tell you something

251
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,990
and forgive me if I 
sound like I'm an asshole

252
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,980
I mean condescending.
I don't wanna sound condescending

253
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,340
I'm just making it worse, aren't I?

254
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,690
No, I would like to say

255
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:42,490
It is inspiring to me to see how effortless
you make everything look

256
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:46,230
That was a terrible thing to say.
Oh, my God.

257
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,230
I should just never be allowed to speak

258
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:52,640
and I don't drink very often.
I'm drunk

259
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:56,240
- Did Madame Gauthier tell you?
- Tell me what?

260
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,990
- My story?

261
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,930
- No, I don't know.
I mean no

262
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,730
Well, she loves to gossip.
So you've been warned.

263
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,530
Car accident

264
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:09,730
Last winter,
my wife died

265
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,360
- Wow, that's awful

266
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,860
- Yeah.
I know it is

267
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,930
The doctor said I should be
able to walk again one day

268
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:24,630
but so far so nothing

269
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,170
- That, that is an awful story
- Yeah, it is

270
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,350
- Spencer

271
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,160
I can't tell
you how sorry I am

272
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,960
- Why the fuck are you sorry.
You didn't do anything.

273
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,500
Where is Louise.
I am starving

274
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,900
Look at that.
I fished my wish

275
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,100
- Are these guys new?

276
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,130
- Which ones?

277
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,360
- Mean looking sharky ones
- Ehm, no I don't think so

278
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,560
- Really?
- Well, some are. I think

279
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:15,860
OK, so since someone forgot to bring dessert
- Oh, I completely forgot. Bad guest.

280
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,950
- You know I could run out to the
store right now and grab some

281
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,230
- But he still managed to bring two
very decent bottles of wine, so...

282
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:26,160
- I like wine. I don't drink it very often but I like
to research it. Read about it, compare the differences

283
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:29,850
- Is he ever gonna stop talking?
- Sorry

284
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:37,950
- So wine plus wine minus dessert equals coffee and slightly
less of a Choco than Louise gets to the power of...

285
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,460
Can we please turn of
the fucking television?

286
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,510
- Now?
I mean.

287
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,210
We don't even know officially

288
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,670
- Oh, yes we do.
You won man. Canada.

289
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,950
Can we mute it at least?

290
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:04,350
But, you know. I didn't just win.
We all win.

291
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,950
- We all win? How'd we all win?
Because we're English?

292
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,980
- No.
What...

293
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,810
- Can I make a drink-drink?
- Of course

294
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,550
- You want something, Victor?

295
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,450
- Would it be OK if I rolled a joint?

296
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,350
- It would be very OK

297
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,650
- Great

298
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:28,350
Do you want a scotch?
- I do

299
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,580
- I'm so sorry about dessert.
I fucked that up.

300
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,830
- Oh, God. Please stop apologizing
- But that Choco was so good.

301
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,360
What was it?
- I don't know, man

302
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,960
- OK, it was delicious. Thank you.

303
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:43,300
- We will have to do this again. Soon.
My place next time.

304
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:47,230
Oh, Jesus Christ. No, your place.
I will cook then.

305
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:55,250
- OK, thanks...from before
- No problem at all. At all.

306
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,380
So you're off at same time tomorrow?

307
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,140
- Yeah
- Great, I'll be there

308
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,300
- No, you don't have to...
- Are you kidding me.

309
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,800
I can't have you walking home by yourself
with that crazy running around out there

310
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,900
- Yeah, OK, thanks

311
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,900
Good night

312
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,900
- This voice mailbox is full.
Please try...

313
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:54,830
- Hi there

314
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,990
Ready to go home?

315
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,890
So how was work today?
- It was fine

316
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,970
- 'anything interesting happen?
- Nope

317
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:13,580
- How would you feel about having
some real Chinese food tonight?

318
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,670
- Em, no
- Oh, OK

319
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:24,550
- I work at a Chinese restaurant
- No, I know. I just thought that we... Never mind.

320
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:29,250
Don't forget about my party at eight. It's on Friday night.
- OK

321
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:34,900
- And I got a surprise for you.
I really think you are gonna like it

322
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,930
- Thanks, Victor.
I will see you soon, OK?

323
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,730
Jesus

324
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,220
Oh, sorry guys

325
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:29,280
- Hello, maybe because you're English, and you won
the referendum you did not understand my message

326
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,510
I'll be clear.
Keep your fucking cats away from...

327
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:39,700
- Hello beautiful. It seems we may have another
small problem with My Lady like you are...

328
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,790
- How could anyone not love you?

329
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,990
Scaring birds away from her bird bath

330
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,910
It's fucking winter.

331
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,740
God is scaring the birds away from her bird bath

332
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,170
And isn't she not supposed to block
the fire escape with her garbage?

333
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,690
- I think she's losing her shit.
- Oh, really?

334
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,550
- You should have seen the
fit she threw this morning

335
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,860
Her creepy little husband went
away on another "business trip"

336
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,840
- I don't think he's creepy.
I think he's pathetic.

337
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,540
- You don't get a serial rapist vibe off of him?

338
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,640
- No, I don't think he's that interesting

339
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:56,900
Oh, there's an article about
the actual serial rapist

340
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,930
- Oh, national coverage.
How exciting.

341
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:8,930
Can I ask you something?
- Sure

342
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,730
- How come you didn't tell me you knew that last victim?
What was her name...?

343
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,730
- Johanne
- Yes

344
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,660
- I don't know.
I didn't know her very well

345
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,310
How do you even know that?

346
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,010
Know what?

347
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,300
- That I knew her

348
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,900
- One of the papers said she
worked at a Chinese restaurant in NDG.

349
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:32,300
- Which paper?

350
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:36,300
- I don't know, one of the ones
Ms. Van Ilen brought over probably

351
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,940
- What did the article say?

352
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,310
Just that she worked at a Chinese
restaurant in NDG. It was a little thing.

353
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,810
I was just curious why you never mentioned it

354
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,950
- I don't know

355
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,990
It was referendum night

356
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,430
Victor was around

357
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:58,430
- Yes, Victor is always around these days. Isn't he?
- Guess so

358
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:02,650
- How are things going between you guys?

359
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,280
- What's that supposed to mean?

360
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:06,100
- Oh, give me a fucking break, Louise

361
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,920
- I don't know what you're talking about

362
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,920
- Fine

363
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,060
- Can I have another?

364
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,670
- Only if it's a road rock and I'm done

365
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,950
What the fuck are you doing, Victor?

366
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,940
- Oh, good morning

367
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,970
Madame Gauthier said it was OK

368
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:47,130
- I just thought it was a bit ridiculous
not to have it in this day and age

369
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,570
Regardless of whether
you're living here or not.

370
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,980
But, you are living here so
it's even more ridiculous

371
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,580
- What?

372
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:01,460
-It's a ramp.
For wheelchairs.

373
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,500
Hey Spencer

374
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,310
I'm sorry bud.

375
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:14,160
I clearly should have asked you first.
I guess I thought it

376
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,640
might be a nice surprise...

377
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:16,980
for Christmas.

378
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,570
I shouldn't have done it.

379
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,450
I didn't think it would piss you off

380
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,690
- Oh, no. You didn't piss me off.

381
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,960
No, I'm gonna make you some coffee

382
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,710
- Hello, beautiful

383
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,910
At one point, enough is enough, eh?

384
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:38,510
She's been calling every day.
- Yeah, me too.

385
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:41,390
- What, guys?
Are you hungry?

386
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:44,090
- So, have you called her back?

387
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:49,870
- No, not yet.  I mean...
Ok - I get it!

388
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:58,070
I mean, I just don't have
anything to say to her.

389
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,780
- OK, happy holidays Miss Van Ilen.

390
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,980
- Alright then, Spencer.
You as well.

391
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,800
You, young man are a candidate for sainthood

392
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:30,700
- Oh, me? Hardly, hardly.
I just like to do stuff with my hands

393
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,860
- Merry Christmas
- Merry Christmas to you too

394
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,770
She's so nice
- I hate her

395
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,180
So, do you think you might come to my Christmas party?

396
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,110
- I'm not so much for parties, man

397
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:51,210
- Well, this is going to be super chill. It's just
going to be my brother driving in from Ottawa.

398
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:55,820
- Victor, I'm really really not interested
in going to a party. Any party.

399
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,830
No matter how chill

400
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:02,390
- Oh, OK, I just thought...
- I can imagine what you thought. But I'm gonna pass.

401
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,960
Louise will be so disappointed

402
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,520
- Hi

403
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,740
- Here.
Oh, wow - Thank you. Come on in.

404
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:30,920
Louise, that's my brother Jonah.
Jonah, this would be Louise.

405
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,740
- Hey, the famous Louise. Nice to meet you.
This is Jיrפme.

406
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,930
- Who wants a drink?
- Me

407
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,220
Did you want to drink this stuff?

408
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,520
Uh, no.  I'll just have a vodka...
- Oh, a drink-drink

409
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,820
Alright, done.

410
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,070
- Did you just... I'm sorry
- No, no, no, I'm sorry. Go ahead please...

411
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:00,370
- No, it's ok. Mine was stupid. You go.

412
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,130
I have to pee anyway

413
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,200
- So?
- So what?

414
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,440
- What do you think of her?

415
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,550
- Louise?
- Of course, Louise.

416
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:27,850
- I haven't gotten a chance to talk to her.
- She's so awesome

417
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:30,050
- Yeah, she seems great, man.
She seems good.

418
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,950
- We're engaged

419
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,400
- You... oh, shit.

420
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:35,920
Congratulations.

421
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
- Yeah, we're not telling anyone yet.

422
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:40,250
She wants to wait till Spring.

423
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:43,600
It's more romantic
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

424
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,960
- Victor...
- Oh my God, I almost completely forgot...

425
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,530
Louise

426
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,360
I have a surprise for you

427
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,960
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's OK

428
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:09,330
- One more second
- OK, Victor...
- Trust me, trust me

429
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,670
Louise

430
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,570
Meet Balthazar

431
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,920
He was my cat over in China

432
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,730
So, I had to wait for him to go through all the

433
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,170
quarantine procedures. They do
all that stuff in Ottawa.

434
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,760
That's kind of weird, eh?

435
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,930
So, my brother just brought him in.

436
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,910
He's great, eh?

437
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,510
- He's perfect

438
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:13,250
- What are you doing?

439
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:23,750
- Up the fire escape to the first floor...?
- Yeah

440
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,930
- Are you serious?
What time?

441
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:34,730
- I don't know, Victor. Like

442
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,730
three or four in the morning

443
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:39,370
- Cause, the first floor is Spencer's apartment

444
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:46,600
Are you sure that's what you saw?
- Yeah, I'm sure

445
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:48,910
- It just doesn't make any sense
- Why not?

446
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,520
- Cause Spencer is in a wheelchair.
Like...

447
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:56,840
were you wearing your glasses?
- Yeah, I'm lying. That's why.

448
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:59,630
- I didn't say that
- I'm always wearing my glasses!

449
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,930
- Give it a rest guys.
Come on guys, please?

450
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:08,240
- Hey
- Am I too early?
- No, no, no. Everyone's up. Come in.

451
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:11,940
- Good

452
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:28,620
- Uhm, eggs are getting cold

453
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,930
- Coming

454
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:43,930
- Hello?
- Hey man, it's Victor
- Yeah?

455
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:53,630
- Merry Christmas
- Merry Christmas, man

456
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,230
- You guys have twenty seconds

457
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:05,030
- So, uh, Merry Christmas...or whatever
- Bye

458
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:11,030
- Spencer?
- Yep?

459
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:15,470
- Have you seen my cats?
- Nope

460
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:20,270
- I mean like, today... like, this morning.
- No

461
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:22,950
- OK, thanks.

462
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:33,380
- Madame Gauthier

463
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:38,990
- If I don't take them down now, they
will be hanging all year. I just know it.

464
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,590
- You haven't seen my cats, have you?

465
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:45,910
- Uhm, no, not today

466
00:49:58,840 --> 00:49:59,750
- You guys...

467
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,980
- What happened?

468
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:09,800
- Don't look, don't look

469
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:46,070
Are you joking? Of course it was
her. She fucking hated those cats

470
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:48,440
- Well, we don't that
they were poisoned

471
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:51,780
Yes we do Victor! They didn't
have simultaneous heart attacks

472
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:53,940
OK, well, we don't know
that it was Valיrie

473
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,280
- Yes, we do

474
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,170
- We have to do something.

475
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:03,680
We can't just leave the cats lying in the snow and we
can't just pick them up and dump them in the garbage

476
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,160
- Well obviously not, Victor. Jesus Christ
- Well what Jesus Christ? People do that

477
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,960
- Louise isn't people

478
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,510
- I know that

479
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:13,530
Louise,

480
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,970
what would you like to do?

481
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,940
- I wanna bury them.

482
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:29,760
Under Valיrie's window

483
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,980
- Hi there
- I need to see him

484
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,040
- Is this another murder?

485
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:55,440
- Yeah, a few days ago. Didn't you read about it?
- No

486
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,610
- Salut, Nathalie
- Hi Victor

487
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,820
- Ready to go?
- Yeah

488
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,600
- Yeah, so, I told Madame Gauthier,
I said:

489
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:21,910
"how can we let Balthazar out

490
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:26,370
when we know for a fact that there's
a cat killer in our building?"

491
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:32,690
We already lost Mozart and we lost Tia Maria.
And that Valיrie woman is so insane

492
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:35,990
Boy, it's cold

493
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:41,140
Are you sure? I mean, I bought lamb.
I thought that was your favorite?

494
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:46,390
- It is, I just need to take a bath and I need some quiet time...

495
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:48,920
OK

496
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:56,990
Are you sure, you don't just want
to come up and see Balthazar?

497
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:01,690
- Do you think it would be OK
if he spent the night with me?

498
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:07,450
- I know we haven't known each other very long

499
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:11,430
But when I met you I felt

500
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:17,500
a connection I couldn't explain,
so...

501
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:23,910
I know we haven't known
each other very long.

502
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:28,290
But like, I feel this connection
to you that I can't explain.

503
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:31,340
Well, fucking try to it explain it, asshole.

504
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:34,190
I know we haven't known each other very long.

505
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:36,970
But it's like,

506
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:39,220
I feel this connection to you.

507
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:42,960
And I can't really explain it.

508
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:45,780
And I look at you and I,

509
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,590
see that maybe you feel it too.

510
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:50,830
- OK, so here's what's on
the list I am making.

511
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:53,780
Tell me if I'm forgetting something, OK?

512
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:59,780
First, I need a straight razor

513
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,810
Second, plastic gloves

514
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,910
Third, well...
I need something to rape her with

515
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:29,610
And then I guess I need sperm...

516
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:31,930
You know, to make it seem real

517
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,250
- One second
- OK

518
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:19,430
- I will just take care of this
- Yeah

519
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,360
I just have to go down to my place for a second.

520
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:58,870
Don't look at me like that

521
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,630
Have you seen that?

522
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:46,610
- Yeah, you're right.
There's a lot more detail there

523
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:50,810
- Do you think he kills them while
he's raping them or after?

524
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:55,440
or before even?

525
00:59:58,430 --> 00:59:59,740
- I don't know

526
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,730
- I bet before

527
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,220
- Why do you think you're so interested in all this stuff?

528
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:09,300
- Why do I think?
- Yeah

529
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,410
-  That's such a prick question

530
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,300
You'd never ask a guy that question.

531
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:20,100
Actually, you probably would.

532
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:26,590
I don't know, Spencer.

533
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:31,590
I'm a voyeur and it turns me on.

534
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,620
I'm numb and it makes me feel alive.

535
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,510
Who cares?

536
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:40,300
"Why" is boring, and it's the wrong question

537
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,340
- It is?

538
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:45,170
- It is.
And it's beneath you

539
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:48,920
- So what's the right question?

540
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:53,420
- What's next?

541
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:03,310
Do you ever like dancing?

542
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:07,310
- No.
But I always like watching

543
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,760
- Oh, so then you like this
- I've seen better

544
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,990
- Not recently though, huh?

545
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:25,940
- You suck.

546
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:28,980
No tip unless you feel me up again

547
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:53,420
- Ah, you're really leaving?
- Yeah, bye.

548
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:55,240
- I'm gonna miss my fucking train, Louise.

549
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:58,940
- I have the flu, Nathalie!

550
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:09,570
Hey babe. I came home early

551
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,670
- Louise?

552
01:02:58,130 --> 01:02:59,990
- Take it down a notch, Vic.

553
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:17,050
- Hey, this is Louise, leave a message

554
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:21,150
- Hey Louise, it's me, Victor.

555
01:03:21,242 --> 01:03:24,250
I stopped by the restaurant but
I guess you took off early

556
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:27,950
which is smart 'cause it's really
really cold out there, so...

557
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:33,950
OK. I hope you're keeping warm.
Call me. Bye.

558
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,410
- Please no!

559
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:11,190
- God, that's so disgusting

560
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:18,270
I don't know how people do this

561
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:51,430
- Fuck it

562
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:13,730
- Hi
- Hi

563
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:18,080
- Can you help me up?
- What?

564
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:19,900
- Give me a boost

565
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:22,590
- Ah, sure. Yeah, yeah

566
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:35,439
- Oh, shit

567
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:38,039
- Thanks

568
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:11,910
- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck

569
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:28,760
- Son of a bitch

570
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,300
Hey
- Oh, hi

571
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:47,910
- You, you good? I feel like I haven't seen you in forever
- Two days

572
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:52,720
- Good morning

573
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:55,890
- Morning
- Morning

574
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:57,970
- Quite the bru-ha-ha down there

575
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:59,960
- Yeah, what's going on there exactly?

576
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,560
- You tell me

577
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:17,580
- Madame Gauthier

578
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:20,899
- Oh, it's terrible.

579
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:25,300
It's just terrible.
I've never seen anything more gruesome,

580
01:11:25,450 --> 01:11:28,840
in my whole life.
Including on the TV.

581
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:30,040
- What happened?

582
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:33,520
Valיrie.
She was murdered

583
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:54,280
- Where were you last Tuesday night?

584
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:58,780
- I was here?
- All night?

585
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:03,380
- Oh, no. That's right. Tuesday night,
it was my Knight's game night.

586
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:06,380
It must have slipped my mind

587
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,860
- Where you alone?

588
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:12,750
- Uh, yes. I was alone

589
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:16,950
- No one came by?
- Nope. No one came by

590
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:19,980
- You know, the land lady, uh...

591
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:23,170
She tells us that you are friends with the
lady upstairs and the gentleman above her?

592
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:24,580
- Did she?
- Yeah

593
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,680
- Ah, well friendly I would say.

594
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:30,430
I think friends would be a bit of an exaggeration
- I see

595
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:37,630
- So, I guess... They can't verify anything you've said
- No, I guess not

596
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:41,170
Was that the night, the night
Valיrie died. Last Tuesday?

597
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:45,790
- How well did you know her?
- Not well

598
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:48,590
- Enough that you could recognize her face?

599
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:55,080
- Enough to recognize her voice. She was very fond
of screaming at her husband from the balcony

600
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:02,980
- You ever been in her apartment?
- Ah, never. No

601
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:05,980
- Know any of her friends?

602
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:12,810
Sorry fellas, I just, I don't know. I don't
think I am going to be very helpful here

603
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,030
- My card, Monsieur

604
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:18,680
- Roland.

605
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:20,390
That's a great name

606
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:22,440
- My cellular number is on the back

607
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:26,920
- There it is. OK.
Best of luck, you guys

608
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:35,120
- I guess we can cross him off, huh?

609
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:37,970
- We cannot!
- Really?

610
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:41,450
- Never make assumptions.
Let me see your notebook.

611
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:48,350
- Man, you got terrible handwriting

612
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,800
- This is that girl's apartment.

613
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,700
The one from the Chinese restaurant.

614
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,510
She's probably at work

615
01:13:57,610 --> 01:13:59,400
- Right, right

616
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:14,900
- Sorry

617
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:18,400
- Thank you Mr. Spiegelman
- Sure thing, sure thing

618
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:23,170
Where were you last Tuesday evening?

619
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:25,950
- Here in my apartment

620
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:28,360
- All night?

621
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,850
- Yeah, there was a snow storm that night.

622
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:32,990
No, no, no maybe there wasn't.

623
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:39,300
It seems like it snows all the time

624
01:14:41,070 --> 01:14:42,740
- Were you alone?
- Yeah

625
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:47,540
- No, no, no.
My fiancיe was here with me.

626
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:48,930
Louise

627
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:52,330
- Wait, is that the girl from downstairs?

628
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:53,850
- Yeah, Louise

629
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:56,510
Yeah, it was part of the night.

630
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:59,520
No, well. Yeah, I would say it
was most of it actually.

631
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:05,420
And Balthazar, my cat.
The three of us.

632
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:08,360
Maybe I shouldn't say
anything about the cats,

633
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,180
but you probably already
heard about that stuff.

634
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:16,660
It's just that Madame Gauthier loves to gossip and,

635
01:15:17,030 --> 01:15:19,840
and, Valיrie and Louise, and the cats...

636
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:24,920
That whole thing has been a bit of a real,
kind of, hot topic, as of late.

637
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:29,660
But you probably already know about that stuff

638
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,150
- Pretend I don't

639
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:39,850
- So, Louise, right?
- Yeah

640
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,970
- Where were you last Tuesday night?
- Home

641
01:15:44,270 --> 01:15:47,770
- Alone? - Yeah
- All night? - Yeah

642
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:54,370
- I came home from work, I fed
the cat, took a bath, went to sleep.

643
01:15:55,670 --> 01:15:58,870
Like most nights
- OK

644
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:04,320
You didn't see anybody? I don't know,
maybe somebody else in the building? - No

645
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:11,750
- How well did you know Valיrie?
- Not well

646
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:15,770
How would you characterize your relationship with her?
- Vaguely

647
01:16:16,290 --> 01:16:19,930
- How would you characterize her
relationship with your cats?

648
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:24,070
- I'm awfully sorry for your loss.

649
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,330
I understand that you had a very special bond with

650
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:28,940
Mozart and Tia Maria?

651
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:34,840
- I did
- Louise, telephone

652
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:36,840
- Excuse me

653
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:47,640 
- I think you should come by my place
for a drink when you get off work today.

654
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,940 
We have things to discuss
- OK

655
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:55,940
Listen mom, I am right in the middle of something
with the cops right now but that sounds fine

656
01:16:56,440 --> 01:17:01,540 
- Don't say anything you don't need to
- Bye, mom

657
01:17:05,240  --> 01:17:09,540
Sorry about that.
So, what where you asking me again?

658
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:10,950
Oh right, my cats.
Yes.

659
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:14,650
She hated them.
She probably killed them.

660
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:18,310
But I mean, who cares, right?
They're just cats

661
01:17:27,830 --> 01:17:29,610
- So where to now,
back to the lab, or?

662
01:17:29,610 --> 01:17:31,980
- No, I think we have to go back to that apartment.

663
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:33,980
Something's going on with these people

664
01:17:57,310 --> 01:18:00,760
- Just let me feed Balthazar

665
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:23,940
- I told them almost everything.

666
01:18:24,030 --> 01:18:26,900
I was just so nervous.
Louise, I couldn't stop talking.

667
01:18:27,130 --> 01:18:29,560
I told them about you and Valיrie and the cats

668
01:18:29,730 --> 01:18:32,260
and I told them about us
- What do you mean?

669
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:34,890
- I told them that... oh shit.

670
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:39,940
I should of told you too. I'm such an idiot
- What did you tell them, Victor?

671
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:42,660
- I told them that you and
I were engaged and that

672
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:46,950
you spent the night of
the murder here with me.

673
01:18:47,450 --> 01:18:49,950 
But that's not the worst thing.

674
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:55,310
The worst thing is I know who killed
Valיrie and nobody will believe me

675
01:19:09,530 --> 01:19:13,310
- So, what did you want to talk about, mom?

676
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:22,840
- So, I think we have a common problem, Louise
- We have?

677
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:26,270
I know that you have a problem, Spencer.
But I didn't realize that I did

678
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:28,570
- Oh, you didn't?

679
01:19:29,410 --> 01:19:32,370
Was that big cop, the one that
questioned you about Johanne?

680
01:19:32,410 --> 01:19:35,000
- Suddenly you remember her name?

681
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:39,800
- And he questioned you again today,
didn't he. About Valיrie?

682
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:42,930
- That's so odd that you remember Johanne

683
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:53,330
Yes, it was the same cop.
- Well, I think I have a solution

684
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:56,890
- And here I am still
unclear on the problem

685
01:19:59,050 --> 01:20:03,590
- Louise, I know we haven't had a chance
to chat properly since last Tuesday,

686
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:06,190
but I think you're a smart person.

687
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:07,800
I really do.

688
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:11,800
And I like to think that you
think that I'm a smart person.

689
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:16,500
Now do you wanna keep fucking around,

690
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:19,800
or do you wanna hear my solution?

691
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,950
- Sure

692
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:27,900
- Victor
- Victor?
- Victor

693
1:20:28,000 --> 1:20:29,400
- Spencer

694
1:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,800
I saw him, walking outside that night.

695
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:37,160
And I would have thought that my eyes
were playing tricks on me.

696
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:40,320
But stupid Jean-Marc kept saying
he thought he saw someone

697
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:44,270
crawling into Spencer's window when they
were here for that Christmas visit

698
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:50,680
- OK, so he saw Spencer walking.
That means he's getting better

699
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,660
- No. It means so much more than that.

700
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:58,820
- Oh, Louise. You always want to
see the best in people, don't you?

701
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,120
- I guess so

702
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:05,860
- Spencer killed Valיrie.
And that's not all...

703
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,860
- You think...
- No, I know.

704
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:11,750
It makes perfect sense.
He's a killer.

705
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:15,930
Spencer
He's the NDG serial killer.

706
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:20,570
- What does Victor have
to do with any of this?

707
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:24,970
- Nothing. That's why he's
the perfect fall guy.

708
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:30,250
- Just moved back to town.
He's lonely, he's sad.

709
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:36,050
We can pin Valיrie's murder on him and
probably a bunch of the others too

710
01:21:36,050 --> 01:21:37,750
- How?

711
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:40,900
- By writing an effective
suicide note for him.

712
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:43,890
I think together, we could come
up with something satisfying.

713
01:21:43,990 --> 01:21:46,450
For both parties involved

714
01:21:47,650 --> 01:21:49,250
- You think you've thought this through?

715
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:53,850
- I've been thinking about it. All day long.
Now look,

716
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:55,860
when I saw Spencer, he saw me too.

717
01:21:55,950 --> 01:21:57,930
Or at least, I think he did.

718
01:21:58,530 --> 01:22:04,980
And if he's the man I'm pretty sure he is, then
he's gotta be thinking of only one thing.

719
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:08,180
I need to kill Victor.

720
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:10,320
And we can use that to our advantage

721
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,910
- We can?
- Yes

722
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:19,730
Yes. We can set a trap.
Cause I know, he's

723
01:22:19,730 --> 01:22:23,140
just waiting for a chance, for
any chance to get rid of me.

724
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:25,140 
So we're gonna fake his suicide?
- Exactly

725
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:26,660
- How?

726
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,650
- Throw him off a bridge. Who cares?

727
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,490
- Clearly, not you

728
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:34,790
- Oh that's right, that's right.
I'm talking about your boyfriend

729
01:22:34,910 --> 01:22:36,900
- Fiancיe, apparently

730
01:22:38,270 --> 01:22:41,030
- Oh, be sure to let me
know where you register

731
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:42,530
- So your saying we'll let a trap play out
- Yes

732
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:44,920
- But a trap in which you are the bait?
- Exactly

733
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:47,510
But what if he actually does
manage to kill you, Victor?

734
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:49,110
He won't.

735
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:54,990
Because I'm not just me.
I'm us, and we're a team.

736
01:22:56,200 --> 01:23:00,240
And together, we're stronger than him

737
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:07,760
- Suicide note, bridge
- Keep it simple, stupid and shit gets done

738
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:11,260
- Right?
- Right

739
01:23:11,310 --> 01:23:12,960
- Are you in?
- I'm in

740
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:13,910
- They haven't told you anything?

741
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:15,640
- Nothing at all

742
01:24:15,870 --> 01:24:18,860
- That's almost irresponsible
- I agree

743
01:24:24,830 --> 01:24:25,850
- Hi

744
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:29,520
- Hello beautiful
- Hello dear
- Bye

745
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,960
- What a strange girl

746
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:43,810
- Apparently, she and Victor got engaged
- Really?

747
01:24:44,910 --> 01:24:46,990
Huh, that didn't take very long

748
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:51,919
- What's the music?

749
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,210
- It's Dvorak
- It's intense

750
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:59,209
- Alright gang we are about ten
minutes away from eating lamb

751
01:24:59,210 --> 01:25:02,160
Spencer has the best pots and pans

752
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:04,460
- Louise, why don't you fix us some drinks?

753
01:25:05,150 --> 01:25:08,820
- And Louise, maybe just turn the
music down... just a wee bit.

754
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:13,920
You don't mind, do you Spencer?
- Not at all

755
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:20,710
- Dinner party?
- Well, whatever. The three of us have dinner together

756
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:21,700
- Why?

757
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,380
- Because, then we are the
last people to see Victor.

758
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:28,380
And we can tell the cops how
sad and weird he was acting.

759
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:31,950
How close to the end in retrospect
- OK

760
01:25:32,190 --> 01:25:35,650
- Spencer, I feel like I
haven't seen you in forever

761
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:39,420
And I haven't got the chance to ask you,

762
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:41,990
have you tried the ramp yet?

763
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:45,720
- You know what? I haven't

764
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:51,960
- Really
- You'll be the first call when I do, though

765
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:54,450
- That's funny...

766
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:03,900
What's funny, Victor?

767
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:07,460
- It's just that the other day
when I passed you in the hallway,

768
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:09,900
I could've sworn that I
smelled the cold on you.

769
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,450
You know how it is when in the
winter time, you go outside

770
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:20,930
and the cold kinda... sticks to your
clothing and hangs around you like a...

771
01:26:21,630 --> 01:26:23,990
- Like a smell?
- Like a smell, exactly

772
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:27,260
- You must've been mistaken

773
01:26:30,010 --> 01:26:33,370
- I must've been mistaken.
Must have.

774
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:38,050
Thank you, Spencer.
- Thank you, Victor. You're a terrific cook.

775
01:26:38,050 --> 01:26:40,100
- We have to do this again very soon
- Hope so

776
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,820
Night guys!

777
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:57,940
So you tuck him in. You leave
him alone in his room.

778
01:26:57,950 --> 01:26:59,730
But the two most important things are:

779
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:01,680
you go back to your apartment and...

780
01:27:01,810 --> 01:27:04,170
- I leave his window open. I got it.

781
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:09,540
- And how will I know if you've done both of those things?
- I'll run a bath

782
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:19,770
- OK, so then we wait for Spencer?
- Yeah

783
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:24,960
But here's the thing; we won't
be the only ones waiting for him

784
01:28:30,650 --> 01:28:32,960
- So did you say we're gonna
be here like all night?

785
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:38,530
- I didn't say one way or the other
- OK

786
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,780
- Oh, is that what we are looking for?

787
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:53,730
You said we were waiting for
a sign so I thought...

788
01:28:55,730 --> 01:28:57,490
It's cold in here, right?

789
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:00,400
- What, Bilodeau?
What do you wanna do?

790
01:29:01,910 --> 01:29:04,780
Maybe I could go get us a couple of coffees
- Go then, go.

791
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:05,980
- Thanks

792
01:29:11,310 --> 01:29:12,530
- The cops?

793
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:16,360
No, I think that's a terrible
idea Victor. Don't call the cops

794
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:19,000
- I think its a good idea.
I think...

795
01:29:20,050 --> 01:29:21,650
- You already did, didn't you?

796
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:27,260
Yes, of course I remember you Mr. Spiegelman.
We just met.

797
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,740
Information about whom?

798
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,960
Well what about his condition?

799
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:37,900
- What do you think guys?

800
01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:40,990
Time for a miraculous recovery?

801
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:43,870
I already know what you think

802
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:26,270
- Ah, fuck!
- I'm sorry about this, Spencer. I really am

803
01:30:26,530 --> 01:30:27,880
- Louise!

804
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:33,670
- Police

805
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:40,520
- You industrious little fucker!

806
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,379
- Police

807
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:49,240
- No, no, leave her alone
- Fuck!

808
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:55,419
God! You're fucking pathetic.
You know that, man?

809
01:30:59,350 --> 01:31:02,449
- Do you know what kind of person
you're trying to save here?

810
01:31:02,850 --> 01:31:05,749
You wanna know what kind of girl she really is?

811
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:06,849
- I know everything I need to know

812
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:10,170
- I know you're hungry, sweety

813
01:32:22,690 --> 01:32:24,890
- Call 911. I'm going down there.

814
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:28,990
Mr. Spiegelman. Call 911

815
01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:30,890
- OK

816
01:32:34,150 --> 01:32:36,520
You did the right thing, Mr. Spiegelman.

817
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:38,780
Every step of the way

818
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:43,790
- OK

819
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:54,750
- OK, you can stop now

820
01:32:56,550 --> 01:33:00,910
Oh, silly me.
I thought you were hungry

821
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:45,000
+++++++ Special thanks for corrections to the Coker +++++++
