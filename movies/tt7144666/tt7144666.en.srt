Who are the real-world Illuminati ?

2
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,489
Come on!

3
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:57,725
You can do it!
Get in to second!

4
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,798
Come on, guys! You're
giving this game away!

5
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:05,599
Come on! Pick it up!

6
00:01:06,604 --> 00:01:08,549
Come on, Finney. Come on.

7
00:01:08,574 --> 00:01:10,576
Let's go. You got this.

8
00:01:15,165 --> 00:01:16,777
- Play ball!
- You got this, Finney.

9
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:22,583
Strike!

10
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,208
Yes, Finney! Nice, Finney!

11
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:26,304
Let's go, Finney.
Two more strikes.

12
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:34,895
Swing, batter, batter.
Swing, batter, batter.

13
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,033
Strike two!

14
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:39,935
Yeah!

15
00:01:51,852 --> 00:01:54,305
Eyes open out
there. Eyes open.

16
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:04,859
Oh, no. Oh, no.

17
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:07,895
Home run!

18
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,567
Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!

19
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:14,903
Bruce! Bruce!

20
00:02:14,936 --> 00:02:17,638
Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!

21
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,041
Bruce! Bruce!

22
00:02:19,074 --> 00:02:21,675
Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!

23
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:24,913
Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!
Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!

24
00:02:42,976 --> 00:02:44,586
Hey, dude.

25
00:02:44,758 --> 00:02:46,559
Man, your arm is mint.

26
00:02:47,495 --> 00:02:49,126
You almost had me.

27
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:50,451
- Good game.
- Good game.

28
00:03:11,117 --> 00:03:12,486
Hi, Bruce.

29
00:05:42,577 --> 00:05:45,914
You think you can slurp
that a little louder?

30
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:48,316
I don't think they can
hear you up in Boulder.

31
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:02,030
Sorry, Daddy.

32
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:16,077
<i>I don't know.</i>

33
00:06:16,111 --> 00:06:18,280
Everyone says Fonzie or Richie.

34
00:06:18,313 --> 00:06:20,148
Millie says Potsie,

35
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:22,093
but I don't think anyone
should ever trust anyone

36
00:06:22,117 --> 00:06:24,019
who wants to grow
up and marry Potsie.

37
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:25,886
I think I'll just stick
with my current plan

38
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,355
and marry Danny Bonaduce.

39
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,300
You're not gonna marry a
member of the Partridge Family.

40
00:06:29,324 --> 00:06:30,824
He's so crucial.

41
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:33,028
I love his voice.

42
00:06:33,053 --> 00:06:34,240
It's new.

43
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:36,699
What?

44
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,012
The flyer.

45
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:40,201
Mr. Yamada is putting
them up again.

46
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:44,774
You don't think they're
gonna find them, do you?

47
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:48,443
Not how they want to.

48
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:49,900
Come on. Let's go.

49
00:06:49,925 --> 00:06:51,227
We're gonna be late.

50
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:57,185
Come on!
Hey, come here!

51
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:58,953
Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

52
00:06:58,987 --> 00:07:01,289
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

53
00:07:01,323 --> 00:07:03,191
Fight! Fight!

54
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:05,205
You think
you're so tough, huh?

55
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,767
Let's find out.

56
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:10,127
I will pound you like a nail,
you scrawny little beaner.

57
00:07:10,298 --> 00:07:12,934
- Then do it.

58
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:14,445
- Unless you're scared.

59
00:07:22,883 --> 00:07:24,471
Get him, Robin!

60
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:42,130
Get up!

61
00:07:42,163 --> 00:07:43,298
Hit him harder!

62
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,068
Come on.

63
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:48,127
Holy shit.

64
00:07:48,152 --> 00:07:49,494
Let's go. Let's go.

65
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,040
What the hell?

66
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:02,000
- That was Moose.
- I don't care.

67
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,001
Moose is a giant asshole.

68
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,361
I know.

69
00:08:05,386 --> 00:08:07,462
But last year, when he made
your nose bleed...-Gwen.

70
00:08:07,869 --> 00:08:09,424
-He had it coming.

71
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:11,059
No one has that coming.

72
00:08:11,092 --> 00:08:12,470
- Finney, he beat you up.
- I know, Gwen.

73
00:08:12,494 --> 00:08:14,129
I was there, remember? I...

74
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,398
I just don't want
to talk about it.

75
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:19,300
Well, he was stupid to pick
a fight with Robin Arellano.

76
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:21,102
He's the toughest kid in school

77
00:08:21,136 --> 00:08:23,004
since The Grabber got
Pinball Vance Hopper.

78
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:24,406
I wish you wouldn't
call him that.

79
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,207
Everyone called
him Pinball Vance.

80
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:27,123
No, I mean...

81
00:08:27,148 --> 00:08:29,013
I know who you mean, jerk face.

82
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:31,307
Even the papers call
him The Grabber.

83
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:34,315
Just... I wish you
wouldn't say his name.

84
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,161
You don't actually believe
that story, do you?

85
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:40,288
- No.
- Because he can't hear you.

86
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:42,357
He doesn't really
take kids that say it.

87
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,426
- I know that.
- Finney.

88
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,227
- I said I know.
- Then say it.

89
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:47,196
: No.

90
00:08:47,221 --> 00:08:48,689
Are you chicken?

91
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:52,434
I didn't mean it.

92
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:54,235
I know.

93
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:58,400
The inner core is solid.
The outer core is molten.

94
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,243
The next layer, called the
mantle, is mostly solid.

95
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:04,579
However, the thin outer
zone of the mantle

96
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:06,236
is partially molten.

97
00:09:06,648 --> 00:09:08,268
Next slide.

98
00:09:10,336 --> 00:09:12,038
The surface layer
is called the crust.

99
00:09:12,063 --> 00:09:14,517
It is solid and very thin.

100
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:16,458
As the Earth
separated into layers,

101
00:09:16,491 --> 00:09:18,604
it began to cool slowly,

102
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:21,265
but the interior
was still very hot.

103
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,354
Hey, Finney.

104
00:09:36,228 --> 00:09:39,364
See you at lunch.
I'll save you a seat.

105
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:01,035
Hey, Finney.

106
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:02,470
Come on out, dick weed.

107
00:10:02,504 --> 00:10:04,372
Not fooling anyone, noid.

108
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:13,348
What you doing in
our bathroom? Huh?

109
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:15,416
See the sign? It says "boys."

110
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,385
Yeah, boys, not fags.

111
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:26,127
Dipshits, move.

112
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:29,464
Hey, Finn.

113
00:10:29,497 --> 00:10:31,266
What's happening?

114
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:35,270
You know, just keeping
on keeping on, I guess.

115
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:37,305
Uh-huh.

116
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:40,575
Moose got some damn sharp teeth.

117
00:10:40,608 --> 00:10:42,844
Knuckles bled all first period.

118
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:44,646
Wait.

119
00:10:46,952 --> 00:10:49,150
Fuck with Finn again...

120
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:51,510
I fuck with you.

121
00:10:55,227 --> 00:10:57,062
You can leave now.

122
00:11:05,434 --> 00:11:06,910
Thank you.

123
00:11:06,935 --> 00:11:09,704
You're gonna have to stand up
for yourself one of these days.

124
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,508
Yeah, I know.

125
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:14,509
Hey, why'd you fight Moose?

126
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:16,678
He was just shit-talking.

127
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:18,580
Pretty sure he'd back down.

128
00:11:18,613 --> 00:11:20,348
- Nope.

129
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:22,684
I was so surprised when
he swung, to be honest.

130
00:11:22,717 --> 00:11:25,553
I mean, did you have to?

131
00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:27,889
Looked like you really hurt him.

132
00:11:27,923 --> 00:11:30,124
I was just gonna
knock his ass down.

133
00:11:30,158 --> 00:11:31,392
Whale on him a bit.

134
00:11:31,426 --> 00:11:33,227
But that wouldn't draw no blood.

135
00:11:33,261 --> 00:11:37,165
In a situation like that,
the more blood, the better.

136
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,425
For the crowd, you know?

137
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:39,634
It makes a stronger point.

138
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:43,245
I've seen <i>Texas Chain Saw
Massacre</i> Friday night.

139
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,058
- You seen it?
- That movie's rated R.

140
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,083
My dad would never
take me to see that.

141
00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:48,484
My uncle takes me
to the drive-in.

142
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:50,067
We see everything.

143
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:52,027
But, man, that movie...

144
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:54,482
it's the best ever.

145
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:56,284
Better than <i>Enter the Dragon?</i>

146
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:58,440
- Well, okay. Maybe second best.

147
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:00,655
You know, I want to see a
Bruce Lee movie one day.

148
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:02,690
Like, um, maybe if it
comes on TV, you know?

149
00:12:02,724 --> 00:12:04,459
Yeah. Yeah, you will.

150
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:08,429
Hey, um, you got time to stop
by my house after school?

151
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:10,498
Is it math again?

152
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:12,467
Mr. Johnson talks too fast.

153
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,369
He doesn't explain it
right. Not like you.

154
00:12:14,402 --> 00:12:15,770
Can you walk me through it?

155
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:17,538
If I get another
"F," I'm suspended.

156
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:19,240
Yeah, sure.

157
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:21,242
So, when we
subtract six from 11,

158
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:24,278
we find that the
value of "X" is five.

159
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:31,653
You wanted to see me?

160
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:33,655
Gwendolyn Blake, this is

161
00:12:33,688 --> 00:12:35,723
Detective Wright and
Detective Miller.

162
00:12:35,757 --> 00:12:37,161
Miss Blake.

163
00:12:37,186 --> 00:12:39,255
They would like to talk
to you about something.

164
00:12:43,531 --> 00:12:48,302
Is it... is it true you're
friends with Amy Yamada?

165
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:50,471
We have homeroom together.

166
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:52,306
Is she okay?

167
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,608
She's fine.

168
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,409
You know what this is about.

169
00:12:57,512 --> 00:13:00,415
What did you say to Amy
about her brother Bruce?

170
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:03,451
Just that I had a
dream about him.

171
00:13:03,484 --> 00:13:05,353
What kind of a dream?

172
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:07,522
Just a weird one.

173
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:09,424
What happened in your dream?

174
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:11,293
He was taken. That's all.

175
00:13:11,318 --> 00:13:13,287
By a man with black
balloons in a van.

176
00:13:13,568 --> 00:13:14,832
Yes.

177
00:13:14,857 --> 00:13:16,989
What else can you
tell us about your dream?

178
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,032
Why? It was just a dream.

179
00:13:19,057 --> 00:13:20,659
Who else
knows about the dream?

180
00:13:20,684 --> 00:13:21,722
Nobody.

181
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:24,517
We found two black balloons
at the scene, Gwen.

182
00:13:27,192 --> 00:13:28,561
Oh.

183
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:30,645
We also found one black
balloon at the scene

184
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:32,160
of Griffin Stagg's abduction.

185
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:34,454
And we never released
those details, so...

186
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:37,199
So the question is, where did
you hear about the balloons?

187
00:13:37,324 --> 00:13:38,386
I didn't.

188
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:40,722
I'm gonna ask you again.

189
00:13:40,755 --> 00:13:42,457
How did you know
about the balloons?

190
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,792
What aren't you
telling us, Gwen?

191
00:13:43,817 --> 00:13:45,769
Either there's a leak in the
department, or...-Or what?

192
00:13:45,793 --> 00:13:47,462
I'm The Grabber?
No.

193
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:49,579
You think I kidnapped
Vance Hopper last spring?

194
00:13:49,604 --> 00:13:50,732
Is that it?

195
00:13:50,757 --> 00:13:52,459
Vance got held back twice.

196
00:13:52,484 --> 00:13:54,319
I've seen him
fight, and trust me,

197
00:13:54,344 --> 00:13:56,780
he could kick the shit out
of either of you blindfolded.

198
00:13:56,805 --> 00:13:58,707
Gwen, watch your language.

199
00:13:58,732 --> 00:14:01,568
Yeah, I took him down 'cause
obviously I'm The Grabber,

200
00:14:01,593 --> 00:14:03,429
you dumb fucking fart knockers.

201
00:14:03,454 --> 00:14:05,456
Gwendolyn Blake!

202
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,752
Gwen.

203
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:11,786
What aren't you telling us?

204
00:14:16,824 --> 00:14:19,794
That sometimes my
dreams are right.

205
00:14:27,675 --> 00:14:29,002
There he is.

206
00:14:30,906 --> 00:14:32,908
What was that?

207
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:34,675
Nothing.

208
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,879
I'm staying over
at Susie's tonight.

209
00:14:37,913 --> 00:14:39,814
It's Friday, so you
know what that means.

210
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:41,315
I'll look after Dad.

211
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,709
I'll be home in the morning.

212
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:45,169
And you better not
eat all the ice cream.

213
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:33,195
I'm sorry!

214
00:16:33,228 --> 00:16:35,730
- Dad, stop!
- Hey!

215
00:16:35,763 --> 00:16:38,632
You stay out of this!

216
00:16:38,657 --> 00:16:40,626
- Gwenny.

217
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:42,620
They came to my work.

218
00:16:42,645 --> 00:16:45,646
Why did the police
come to my work?

219
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,508
I don't know! I'm sorry!

220
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,875
You need to
tell me what you know

221
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:50,400
about this investigation.

222
00:16:50,425 --> 00:16:52,047
- Nothing!
- Tell me what... What?

223
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,648
- Nothing.
- Huh?

224
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:54,749
Nothing!

225
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:57,685
- What?!
- Nothing!

226
00:16:57,718 --> 00:17:00,554
Hit me again, and
I'm dropping it!

227
00:17:02,057 --> 00:17:06,028
You drop that, and I will
beat your ass twice as hard.

228
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:12,897
No, Dad!

229
00:17:12,922 --> 00:17:16,238
That was an eight-dollar
bottle of goddamn vodka!

230
00:17:16,271 --> 00:17:18,718
- Oh, now you listen to me.

231
00:17:18,743 --> 00:17:22,897
Listen to me. You
are not your mother!

232
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:23,841
I know.

233
00:17:23,866 --> 00:17:25,890
That means you do not hear
things that are not there.

234
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:28,951
You do not see things
that are not there!

235
00:17:28,984 --> 00:17:30,651
Okay.

236
00:17:30,685 --> 00:17:32,820
- They're not there, Gwenny!
- : Okay.

237
00:17:32,853 --> 00:17:35,523
And your dreams...

238
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:38,026
they're just fucking dreams.

239
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,727
- Do you understand me?
Yes!

240
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,696
- Do you understand me?!
- Yes!

241
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:43,698
Say it. I want to
hear you say it.

242
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:45,700
My dreams are just dreams.

243
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,535
Say it again!

244
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,704
My dreams are just dreams!

245
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:51,106
Say it again.

246
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:54,775
My dreams are just dreams!

247
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:06,620
Go watch some
television or something.

248
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:10,058
And no ice on that
bottom, young lady.

249
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:13,728
I want you to think
about what you did.

250
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,772
Did you know
anything about this?

251
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:30,045
Same goes for you.

252
00:18:30,078 --> 00:18:31,879
You got that?

253
00:18:32,847 --> 00:18:34,916
You got that?

254
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,918
Now, get out.

255
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,087
Mm.

256
00:18:41,756 --> 00:18:44,658
I told you, Davey.

257
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:46,894
You hurt, Sal?
I'm okay.

258
00:18:46,928 --> 00:18:48,863
You okay?

259
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:52,134
Yeah, but this is what
Officer Bob said would happen.

260
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:54,903
Sally, you're late.

261
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:58,706
Your bike's a mess.

262
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:00,042
So am I.

263
00:19:00,075 --> 00:19:02,344
Officer Bob would
fix that wheel,

264
00:19:02,377 --> 00:19:04,678
but I can't ask him now.

265
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:06,614
Why not?

266
00:19:48,123 --> 00:19:49,790
I understand.

267
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:51,725
Thank you for calling.

268
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:07,008
Finney.

269
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:09,978
Yeah?

270
00:20:10,011 --> 00:20:12,847
Do you know a kid
named Robin Are...

271
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,983
A-Ar... Ar...

272
00:20:15,016 --> 00:20:16,817
Arellano?

273
00:20:16,851 --> 00:20:18,819
Yeah, that's it.

274
00:20:19,854 --> 00:20:21,755
He's a friend from school. Why?

275
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,925
I'm really sorry, Finney.

276
00:20:57,926 --> 00:20:59,961
I know he was your friend.

277
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:06,067
Don't say "was."

278
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:07,469
He is my friend.

279
00:21:07,502 --> 00:21:09,670
Sorry.

280
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:15,944
Gwen.

281
00:21:15,977 --> 00:21:17,778
Can you do that dream thing?

282
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:20,048
It doesn't work that way.

283
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:21,782
Have you tried?

284
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:23,218
Of course I have.

285
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:28,023
Well, try again.

286
00:21:28,056 --> 00:21:29,757
Please.

287
00:21:54,115 --> 00:21:58,819
Jesus, I know you know
what I'm going to ask you,

288
00:21:58,852 --> 00:22:00,854
but I'm going to ask you anyway.

289
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:04,926
My brother, he needs his friend.

290
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,195
And I know you can't
just let him go,

291
00:22:07,229 --> 00:22:10,265
because you don't
interfere or whatever.

292
00:22:10,298 --> 00:22:12,800
I don't know the rules.

293
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,971
But if you could help
me have a dream or two

294
00:22:16,004 --> 00:22:18,373
and just see something
that could help the police

295
00:22:18,406 --> 00:22:21,943
or me or anyone find him,

296
00:22:21,977 --> 00:22:24,310
I will follow you forever.

297
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,321
Amen.

298
00:22:41,396 --> 00:22:45,233
Don't think I don't
know what's going on in here.

299
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:48,069
No playing after lights-out.

300
00:22:48,103 --> 00:22:50,038
Sorry, Daddy.

301
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:53,141
Go to sleep.

302
00:22:53,174 --> 00:22:54,976
I love you.

303
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,911
Love you, too, Daddy.

304
00:23:03,184 --> 00:23:04,818
<i></i>

305
00:23:08,456 --> 00:23:11,059
Goddamn it, Gwenny.

306
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:13,950
What the hell did she do now?

307
00:23:14,135 --> 00:23:15,669
We're sorry, Mr. Blake.

308
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,198
Your daughter hasn't
done anything.

309
00:23:17,232 --> 00:23:19,234
But is there any way
we can speak with her?

310
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:02,876
Fucking cocksucking cowards!

311
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:09,084
Fuck you, too, ugly ass face.

312
00:24:19,094 --> 00:24:21,029
Gwen!

313
00:24:35,872 --> 00:24:37,576
All right, class.

314
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,870
It is the day you've been
dreading all semester.

315
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,905
Frog dissection day.

316
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,399
Uh, pick a partner.

317
00:24:43,518 --> 00:24:45,519
Remember, you will be paired

318
00:24:45,544 --> 00:24:48,115
with this partner for
the rest of the year.

319
00:24:56,965 --> 00:24:58,199
Do you need a partner?

320
00:24:58,233 --> 00:24:59,365
Uh, no, no.

321
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:03,405
I-I mean, yeah, I don't
have a partner yet.

322
00:25:03,438 --> 00:25:06,007
Those guys are assholes.

323
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,857
- What?
- This morning.

324
00:25:07,981 --> 00:25:10,116
Everybody's talking about it.

325
00:25:12,113 --> 00:25:13,505
Oh.

326
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:15,550
Your sister's
really cool, though.

327
00:25:15,591 --> 00:25:18,361
I wish my brother and I
were friends like that.

328
00:25:18,386 --> 00:25:19,826
Eyes up here.

329
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,920
All right, let's
cut open a frog.

330
00:25:21,945 --> 00:25:24,781
: Donna,
Donna, Donna.

331
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,164
-"Oh, Finney, will you be my lab partner?"
-Stop.

332
00:25:29,197 --> 00:25:30,998
- Shut up, you jerk.

333
00:25:31,022 --> 00:25:33,685
All right,
see you tomorrow.

334
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,892
Where you going?

335
00:25:34,917 --> 00:25:36,413
I'm staying over
at Susie's tonight.

336
00:25:36,438 --> 00:25:37,857
It's Friday, so...

337
00:25:37,882 --> 00:25:39,599
- I'll look after Dad.
- See you, kid.

338
00:26:07,035 --> 00:26:08,536
Oh!

339
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:11,033
You goof.

340
00:26:11,058 --> 00:26:13,027
Well, isn't that
just peachy keen?

341
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:14,387
You need some help?

342
00:26:14,412 --> 00:26:16,377
You see that?

343
00:26:16,411 --> 00:26:18,179
- Yeah.

344
00:26:18,213 --> 00:26:20,014
Would you hand me my hat?

345
00:26:23,218 --> 00:26:24,763
Yes, sir.

346
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:28,112
I am a part-time magician.

347
00:26:28,356 --> 00:26:30,625
-Would you like to see a magic trick?
-Yeah.

348
00:26:30,658 --> 00:26:33,328
- Yeah?

349
00:26:33,361 --> 00:26:35,997
-Are those black balloons in there?
-Yeah.

350
00:27:05,527 --> 00:27:07,740
My fucking arm.

351
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:11,242
I should snap your neck
for what you did to my arm.

352
00:27:38,426 --> 00:27:39,943
Jesus.

353
00:27:40,896 --> 00:27:43,299
It's covered in blood.

354
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:46,080
It's like I killed someone.

355
00:27:46,489 --> 00:27:48,557
You see that?

356
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,641
Not like you can see shit.

357
00:27:59,614 --> 00:28:02,055
I know you're scared.

358
00:28:02,335 --> 00:28:05,138
But I'm not gonna
hurt you anymore.

359
00:28:06,621 --> 00:28:09,557
What I said about
snapping your neck...

360
00:28:11,626 --> 00:28:13,595
I was angry, is all.

361
00:28:14,852 --> 00:28:18,193
: And you
did a number on my arm.

362
00:28:19,534 --> 00:28:21,669
I'm not gonna hold
it against you. Hmm?

363
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:24,969
I guess...

364
00:28:25,941 --> 00:28:27,642
now we're even.

365
00:28:29,734 --> 00:28:32,136
You don't have to be scared,

366
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:36,651
because nothing bad is
going to happen here.

367
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:41,742
On that I give my word, Johnny.

368
00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:45,928
You like soda?

369
00:28:45,961 --> 00:28:48,730
Hmm? I'll tell you what.

370
00:28:48,763 --> 00:28:52,500
I'm gonna go get you
a soda, and then...

371
00:28:56,385 --> 00:28:58,253
Is that the phone?

372
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,259
You hear a phone ringing?

373
00:29:02,744 --> 00:29:04,646
I'm gonna go see who it is.

374
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,516
Then I'll get you a soda.

375
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:10,746
And then I'll come back and
explain everything. Hmm?

376
00:30:46,647 --> 00:30:49,784
Gwenny, your dad's on the phone.

377
00:30:53,088 --> 00:30:54,722
Hi, Daddy.

378
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,826
No, I haven't.
Not since school.

379
00:31:49,443 --> 00:31:51,445
<i></i>

380
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,137
It doesn't work.

381
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,832
Not since I was a kid.

382
00:32:18,323 --> 00:32:20,259
Hang it up.

383
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,850
I know you're scared
and you want to go home.

384
00:32:28,883 --> 00:32:30,953
I'll take you home soon.

385
00:32:32,303 --> 00:32:34,300
It's just that...

386
00:32:34,695 --> 00:32:37,397
: Oh, everything's
all fucked up.

387
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:41,495
I got to be upstairs
for a while.

388
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:43,464
Something's come up.

389
00:32:44,465 --> 00:32:45,833
What?

390
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:48,469
Never mind what.

391
00:32:50,705 --> 00:32:52,740
Did someone see something?

392
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:55,863
Are the police coming?

393
00:32:56,444 --> 00:32:58,180
If you let me go
before they get here,

394
00:32:58,213 --> 00:32:59,647
I promise I won't tell.

395
00:33:02,918 --> 00:33:04,852
It's
not the police.

396
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:06,754
Someone, though?

397
00:33:06,787 --> 00:33:08,689
Someone's coming?

398
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:11,592
I'll scream.

399
00:33:11,618 --> 00:33:13,230
If someone's upstairs,
they'll hear me.

400
00:33:13,428 --> 00:33:15,896
No, he won't.
Not with the door shut.

401
00:33:17,531 --> 00:33:18,967
He?

402
00:33:21,736 --> 00:33:23,516
With
the door shut,

403
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:26,041
no one can hear
anything down here.

404
00:33:26,074 --> 00:33:28,344
I soundproofed it myself.

405
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:31,774
So shout if you like.
You won't bother anyone.

406
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:34,044
You're the one
who killed the others.

407
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,266
Bruce.

408
00:33:38,374 --> 00:33:39,444
Robin.

409
00:33:41,656 --> 00:33:43,624
That wasn't me.

410
00:33:43,658 --> 00:33:45,693
That was someone else.

411
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:49,965
I will never make you do
anything that you won't...

412
00:33:51,934 --> 00:33:53,701
like.

413
00:33:55,603 --> 00:33:57,805
If you try to touch me,
I'll scratch your face.

414
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,505
And whoever's coming
will see and ask why.

415
00:34:03,011 --> 00:34:04,812
This face?

416
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,884
Hang up the phone now.

417
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,930
I was down here
once when it rang.

418
00:34:31,073 --> 00:34:34,130
: Ooh.
Creepiest damn thing.

419
00:34:34,564 --> 00:34:37,902
I think it's static
electricity that does it.

420
00:34:38,305 --> 00:34:40,441
It went off while I
was right next to it.

421
00:34:40,466 --> 00:34:42,616
I picked it up without thinking.

422
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:45,208
To see if anyone was there.

423
00:34:46,154 --> 00:34:47,452
Was there?

424
00:34:52,626 --> 00:34:54,257
No.

425
00:35:02,938 --> 00:35:04,805
Help!

426
00:35:05,773 --> 00:35:07,842
Help!

427
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:09,777
Please!

428
00:35:16,784 --> 00:35:19,121
: Help me!

429
00:35:19,154 --> 00:35:21,990
Somebody, please!

430
00:35:23,729 --> 00:35:26,166
Please help!

431
00:35:58,759 --> 00:36:00,861
Stop. Stop. Stop it.

432
00:36:00,886 --> 00:36:02,406
If anyone could've
broke that window,

433
00:36:02,431 --> 00:36:04,333
they already would've done it.

434
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:07,433
Robin would've done it.

435
00:36:15,482 --> 00:36:17,484
You're not getting out of here.

436
00:36:19,642 --> 00:36:21,644
I'm not getting out of here.

437
00:36:45,173 --> 00:36:46,975
Hello?

438
00:36:53,048 --> 00:36:54,788
Hello?

439
00:37:23,178 --> 00:37:24,246
Stop it.

440
00:37:24,279 --> 00:37:25,713
Stop what?

441
00:37:30,952 --> 00:37:32,515
I'm hungry.

442
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,382
I need food.

443
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:36,523
How are your eyes?

444
00:37:37,058 --> 00:37:38,601
They hurt.

445
00:37:44,299 --> 00:37:48,136
Well, I can't
bring you anything to eat.

446
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,944
You'll have to wait.

447
00:37:50,338 --> 00:37:53,108
Is there someone upstairs who
will see you bring me food?

448
00:37:53,141 --> 00:37:54,943
Don't
you worry about that.

449
00:37:54,976 --> 00:37:56,070
If you
weren't gonna feed me,

450
00:37:56,094 --> 00:37:57,881
why'd you even come down here?

451
00:37:58,215 --> 00:38:00,117
Just
to look at you.

452
00:38:02,918 --> 00:38:05,187
I just wanted to look at you.

453
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:09,272
I'll go.

454
00:38:38,732 --> 00:38:40,168
Hello?

455
00:38:43,058 --> 00:38:44,526
Is somebody there?

456
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:45,994
I need help.

457
00:38:52,234 --> 00:38:53,747
Hello?

458
00:38:56,338 --> 00:38:59,309
Finney.

459
00:39:37,178 --> 00:39:39,281
Don't hang up.

460
00:39:39,314 --> 00:39:41,116
I won't.

461
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,052
Who is this?

462
00:39:45,004 --> 00:39:47,502
I don't remember my name.

463
00:39:47,801 --> 00:39:49,203
Why not?

464
00:39:49,424 --> 00:39:52,160
It's the first thing you lose.

465
00:39:52,193 --> 00:39:54,408
First thing you lose when?

466
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:57,027
You know when.

467
00:39:58,433 --> 00:40:00,402
How do you know my name?

468
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:03,244
We met once.

469
00:40:04,007 --> 00:40:05,681
Your arm is mint.

470
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,375
You almost had me.

471
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:12,618
Bruce?

472
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:15,350
Bruce Yamada?

473
00:40:16,918 --> 00:40:18,525
Y-Yeah.

474
00:40:19,287 --> 00:40:20,807
Bruce.

475
00:40:21,089 --> 00:40:23,058
Uh, I'm Bruce.

476
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:26,023
Your arm is mint.

477
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,928
You almost had me.

478
00:40:28,953 --> 00:40:30,783
Did the phone ring for you?

479
00:40:31,825 --> 00:40:34,995
It rang, but none
of us heard it.

480
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,627
Just you.

481
00:40:37,172 --> 00:40:39,207
The Grabber hears
the phone, too,

482
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,376
but he doesn't
want to believe it.

483
00:40:42,932 --> 00:40:44,967
Why are you calling me?

484
00:40:46,514 --> 00:40:48,283
Your arm is mint.

485
00:40:48,852 --> 00:40:50,820
You almost had me.

486
00:40:52,253 --> 00:40:53,978
I'm glad it's you.

487
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:58,274
Finney?

488
00:40:58,299 --> 00:40:59,775
Yeah?

489
00:41:00,228 --> 00:41:02,664
There's a dirt section of
the floor in the hallway

490
00:41:02,697 --> 00:41:04,933
where the tile is loose.

491
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,268
Okay.

492
00:41:07,302 --> 00:41:09,304
Dig down underneath
the foundation.

493
00:41:09,337 --> 00:41:11,139
I tried, but there wasn't time

494
00:41:11,172 --> 00:41:13,141
for me to dig up and
out the other side.

495
00:41:13,174 --> 00:41:14,976
Will I have enough time?

496
00:41:19,414 --> 00:41:20,947
Hello?

497
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:23,158
Bruce?

498
00:41:24,152 --> 00:41:25,713
Bruce?

499
00:41:49,577 --> 00:41:54,382
: I pledge
allegiance to the flag...

500
00:42:06,834 --> 00:42:08,269
Help!

501
00:44:17,191 --> 00:44:19,260
I made you some breakfast.

502
00:44:19,294 --> 00:44:21,062
What did you put in that?

503
00:44:23,047 --> 00:44:25,049
Salt and pepper.

504
00:44:27,602 --> 00:44:30,405
Oh, eat it, don't eat it.

505
00:44:32,407 --> 00:44:34,275
You're already down here.

506
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:36,611
What do I need to drug you for?

507
00:45:06,608 --> 00:45:08,182
Hello?

508
00:45:08,857 --> 00:45:10,558
Don't go upstairs.

509
00:45:12,226 --> 00:45:13,782
Why not?

510
00:45:14,582 --> 00:45:16,338
It's a trap.

511
00:45:16,584 --> 00:45:18,519
Are you...

512
00:45:18,553 --> 00:45:20,355
Are you Bruce?

513
00:45:20,388 --> 00:45:22,223
Who's Bruce?

514
00:45:22,256 --> 00:45:25,159
Uh, I was just talking to Bruce.

515
00:45:26,561 --> 00:45:28,496
I don't know any Bruce.

516
00:45:28,529 --> 00:45:30,498
He's the baseball player.

517
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:35,269
We don't play baseball here.

518
00:45:37,405 --> 00:45:39,207
Who are you?

519
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,325
I don't remember.

520
00:45:42,477 --> 00:45:45,246
Did you play soccer? Football?

521
00:45:46,178 --> 00:45:48,180
I delivered newspapers.

522
00:45:49,651 --> 00:45:51,263
Billy.

523
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:53,788
You're Billy Showalter.

524
00:45:53,821 --> 00:45:55,590
Maybe.

525
00:45:55,623 --> 00:45:57,425
No, you're Billy.

526
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:59,694
Do not...

527
00:45:59,727 --> 00:46:02,697
go upstairs.

528
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:04,806
What is he doing?

529
00:46:05,366 --> 00:46:07,095
He's waiting...

530
00:46:07,283 --> 00:46:09,351
on the other side with
that fucking belt.

531
00:46:10,705 --> 00:46:12,674
He didn't say you can leave,

532
00:46:12,707 --> 00:46:15,626
so if you try, he'll punish you.

533
00:46:16,299 --> 00:46:19,102
He'll beat you with that
belt until you pass out.

534
00:46:20,085 --> 00:46:21,420
It hurts, kid.

535
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,572
It hurts real bad.

536
00:46:23,685 --> 00:46:25,453
You'll cry.

537
00:46:25,478 --> 00:46:27,247
You'll beg him to stop.

538
00:46:27,272 --> 00:46:29,307
We all did.

539
00:46:29,357 --> 00:46:31,259
But he just keeps beating you.

540
00:46:33,028 --> 00:46:34,662
Hello?

541
00:46:36,295 --> 00:46:38,097
Hello?

542
00:48:13,451 --> 00:48:15,420
Oh,
you poor dear.

543
00:48:15,445 --> 00:48:17,781
Go to the nurse's
office and get a nap.

544
00:48:36,818 --> 00:48:39,554
You
said my name was Billy.

545
00:48:39,587 --> 00:48:40,822
Billy Showalter.

546
00:48:40,855 --> 00:48:42,623
Don't call me that.

547
00:48:43,457 --> 00:48:45,726
I don't remember it.
It's not who I am now.

548
00:48:46,861 --> 00:48:48,763
What do you want me
to call you, then?

549
00:48:48,796 --> 00:48:50,464
What do you remember?

550
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,936
I told you.

551
00:48:53,969 --> 00:48:55,870
I was a paperboy.

552
00:48:57,283 --> 00:48:59,219
Okay. Paperboy.

553
00:49:01,334 --> 00:49:03,413
See the wall in front of you?

554
00:49:03,729 --> 00:49:06,231
See how the wall is
separated from the floor?

555
00:49:06,256 --> 00:49:07,490
Yeah.

556
00:49:07,682 --> 00:49:10,155
I tore a long cable
loose from down there.

557
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,615
I kept it hidden.

558
00:49:11,792 --> 00:49:13,794
What am I supposed
to do with that?

559
00:53:14,262 --> 00:53:15,830
Daddy?

560
00:53:15,863 --> 00:53:18,066
Yes, honey.

561
00:53:19,134 --> 00:53:20,936
Can I ask you a question?

562
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:22,837
Of course. Come sit.

563
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:24,318
Come.

564
00:53:24,343 --> 00:53:26,412
There you go.

565
00:53:28,357 --> 00:53:30,212
But you promise
you won't get mad?

566
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:32,341
I promise, honey.

567
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,232
It's about my dreams.

568
00:53:46,537 --> 00:53:48,230
What about your dreams?

569
00:53:48,263 --> 00:53:50,865
Well, what if they...

570
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:54,646
you know, they're... well...

571
00:53:54,671 --> 00:53:55,973
Gwen.

572
00:53:58,614 --> 00:54:00,568
Your mother,

573
00:54:00,693 --> 00:54:03,435
she was a special soul.

574
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,629
And she was smart,

575
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,844
just like you.

576
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,187
But, sweetheart,

577
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:13,038
she was also, uh...

578
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,669
touched.

579
00:54:15,694 --> 00:54:18,932
She saw things and
she heard things,

580
00:54:18,957 --> 00:54:22,201
and sh-she just
became so convinced

581
00:54:22,226 --> 00:54:25,240
that her dreams meant something.

582
00:54:25,265 --> 00:54:29,104
And eventually, they
told her to do things.

583
00:54:31,206 --> 00:54:33,041
Terrible things.

584
00:54:33,074 --> 00:54:35,977
And so she took her own life.

585
00:54:36,011 --> 00:54:39,247
But they weren't
real, sweetheart.

586
00:54:40,461 --> 00:54:42,862
They just weren't real.

587
00:54:43,401 --> 00:54:45,234
I loved Mom.

588
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:48,879
I... I loved her, too.

589
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:53,495
I mean, I loved her
the way she was.

590
00:54:53,528 --> 00:54:55,230
I know, sweetheart.

591
00:54:55,263 --> 00:54:58,934
I... I...

592
00:54:58,959 --> 00:55:00,437
I just... I don't...

593
00:55:00,462 --> 00:55:03,332
I don't want that future
for you, sweetheart.

594
00:55:04,216 --> 00:55:06,085
Do you understand?

595
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:10,382
But...

596
00:55:11,101 --> 00:55:14,770
wh-what if it could
help me find Finney?

597
00:55:48,882 --> 00:55:51,119
Hey! Samson, stop!

598
00:55:51,152 --> 00:55:52,886
Come here! Come
on, boy. Come on.

599
00:55:52,921 --> 00:55:54,131
- Hold on one second.

600
00:55:54,155 --> 00:55:55,366
- Get in here. Go.

601
00:55:56,983 --> 00:55:58,269
- Hello?
Good evening, sir.

602
00:55:58,293 --> 00:55:59,506
We're canvassing
your neighborhood,

603
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:00,734
talking to residents,

604
00:56:00,759 --> 00:56:03,031
and we were wondering,
have you seen this boy?

605
00:56:03,875 --> 00:56:04,943
You're the police.

606
00:56:04,968 --> 00:56:06,538
- Yes. Denver PD.
- Uh-huh.

607
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:08,045
-You're here for the missing kids.
Yes, sir.

608
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:09,421
And if there's anything
at all... No, no.

609
00:56:09,445 --> 00:56:10,871
Come inside.

610
00:56:10,905 --> 00:56:12,467
- Come on. Samson, stop it!

611
00:56:13,798 --> 00:56:15,119
Right. I want to
show you something.

612
00:56:15,143 --> 00:56:16,877
Yeah, right over here.

613
00:56:16,911 --> 00:56:18,381
So, all the kids live in
the same district, right?

614
00:56:18,405 --> 00:56:19,981
They all walk to
and from school.

615
00:56:20,015 --> 00:56:21,546
They were all grabbed on
the way home from school

616
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:23,094
except for Robin
Arellano... He was grabbed

617
00:56:23,118 --> 00:56:25,162
on a Saturday afternoon on his
way to the store to get some

618
00:56:25,186 --> 00:56:26,735
- pop and a candy bar, right?
- Sir, we're well aware of that.

619
00:56:26,759 --> 00:56:29,724
Just listen. He has to be
able to grab these kids

620
00:56:29,749 --> 00:56:31,849
and get them back to
his place very quickly,

621
00:56:31,874 --> 00:56:33,467
which means he's got
a house with a garage.

622
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:34,895
And he can't risk
them getting away

623
00:56:34,929 --> 00:56:36,307
or waking up if he's
knocking them out.

624
00:56:36,331 --> 00:56:39,833
Which means that The Grabber
has to live somewhere

625
00:56:39,867 --> 00:56:42,498
in this area right here.

626
00:56:42,523 --> 00:56:44,172
Mr., uh...
- It's Max.

627
00:56:44,205 --> 00:56:46,308
- Mr. Max...
- No, not Mr. Max.

628
00:56:46,341 --> 00:56:47,890
It's just... it's just Max.

629
00:56:47,915 --> 00:56:49,578
My friends call me Max.
And since we're all

630
00:56:49,602 --> 00:56:50,805
working on this case together,
you know, I figured...

631
00:56:50,829 --> 00:56:52,531
-How long have you lived in the area, Max?
-I-I...

632
00:56:52,555 --> 00:56:54,186
No, I live down in Durango.
I'm just crashing here.

633
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:55,259
This is my brother's place.

634
00:56:55,283 --> 00:56:56,563
I've been reading
about this case a lot,

635
00:56:56,587 --> 00:56:58,229
and I'm in between jobs
right now, and you guys

636
00:56:58,253 --> 00:56:59,321
could really use
my help on this.

637
00:56:59,345 --> 00:57:00,828
You keep working at
this, but if you see

638
00:57:00,852 --> 00:57:03,058
any of these boys,
give us a call.

639
00:57:03,091 --> 00:57:05,393
Wait. Uh, or if I have
any new leads, right?

640
00:57:05,427 --> 00:57:07,462
If you see any of
these boys, then call.

641
00:57:07,495 --> 00:57:10,831
And, uh, might want to tidy up
before your brother gets home.

642
00:57:15,937 --> 00:57:17,439
Oh.

643
00:57:18,306 --> 00:57:23,144
Stupid, stupid, stupid moron.

644
00:57:23,311 --> 00:57:25,347
Goddamn it, Max.

645
00:58:17,365 --> 00:58:20,902
I
know you're not sleeping.

646
00:58:27,575 --> 00:58:29,411
I'm starving.

647
00:58:29,444 --> 00:58:31,513
- Tell me your name.
- Why do you care?

648
00:58:31,546 --> 00:58:34,416
I usually don't.

649
00:58:34,449 --> 00:58:36,518
I find out eventually
in the paper.

650
00:58:36,551 --> 00:58:40,221
They always print
a nice, big photo

651
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:43,258
with all the details
I could ever want.

652
00:58:44,092 --> 00:58:46,428
All the things you
boys lie about.

653
00:58:46,461 --> 00:58:48,263
What's different this time?

654
00:58:48,296 --> 00:58:51,166
Oh...

655
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:53,301
Oh, it's complicated.

656
00:58:53,334 --> 00:58:56,171
It's... too complicated.

657
00:58:56,204 --> 00:58:58,440
Everything's different.
Nothing's going right.

658
00:58:58,473 --> 00:59:00,542
You could let me go.

659
00:59:02,277 --> 00:59:04,145
I'm
thinking about it.

660
00:59:07,048 --> 00:59:09,451
I promise I won't tell anyone.

661
00:59:09,484 --> 00:59:11,519
You can blindfold me,
drop me off on the street.

662
00:59:11,553 --> 00:59:13,188
I'll walk home.

663
00:59:13,221 --> 00:59:16,024
Well,
tell me your name.

664
00:59:17,425 --> 00:59:19,227
Taylor.

665
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,562
Taylor Mullen.

666
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,917
I was really
starting to like you, <i>Finney.</i>

667
00:59:42,283 --> 00:59:44,419
I almost let you go.

668
01:00:00,435 --> 01:00:02,237
Hello?

669
01:00:04,339 --> 01:00:05,745
Bruce?

670
01:00:06,058 --> 01:00:08,094
Billy... Paperboy?

671
01:02:35,423 --> 01:02:36,852
Hello?

672
01:02:40,628 --> 01:02:42,117
Hello?

673
01:02:44,465 --> 01:02:45,733
Hello?

674
01:02:45,767 --> 01:02:48,274
You
don't have much time.

675
01:02:48,469 --> 01:02:50,975
The Grabber hasn't
been sleeping.

676
01:02:51,305 --> 01:02:52,740
He thinks this might be it.

677
01:02:52,774 --> 01:02:55,309
That he's gonna figure it out.

678
01:02:56,149 --> 01:02:57,984
Who's gonna figure it out?

679
01:02:58,009 --> 01:02:59,410
His brother upstairs.

680
01:03:02,817 --> 01:03:04,686
Are you Griffin?

681
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:05,944
Who?

682
01:03:06,178 --> 01:03:08,346
- Griffin Stagg.
- Probably.

683
01:03:08,568 --> 01:03:10,131
It's all a little hazy,

684
01:03:10,156 --> 01:03:12,968
but I imagine you
know all our names.

685
01:03:13,304 --> 01:03:15,172
Every kid does.

686
01:03:17,765 --> 01:03:19,077
I didn't know you.

687
01:03:19,102 --> 01:03:20,796
Nobody did.

688
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,669
You spend so many
years invisible,

689
01:03:23,694 --> 01:03:26,363
and then every kid in the
state knows your name.

690
01:03:27,456 --> 01:03:29,491
You don't have much time.

691
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:33,299
Why hasn't he killed me?

692
01:03:33,324 --> 01:03:35,426
You won't play the game.

693
01:03:35,616 --> 01:03:37,552
You have to play the game.

694
01:03:37,585 --> 01:03:39,554
If you don't play, he can't win.

695
01:03:40,297 --> 01:03:42,032
What game?

696
01:03:42,057 --> 01:03:43,559
Naughty Boy.

697
01:03:43,756 --> 01:03:47,560
If you don't play Naughty Boy,
The Grabber can't beat you.

698
01:03:47,695 --> 01:03:49,764
And if he can't beat you,

699
01:03:49,797 --> 01:03:52,467
he can't move on
to the next part.

700
01:03:52,492 --> 01:03:54,594
And the next part of Naughty Boy

701
01:03:54,635 --> 01:03:56,671
is his favorite part.

702
01:03:58,183 --> 01:03:59,551
What's the next part?

703
01:04:02,469 --> 01:04:05,472
: You don't
have much time.

704
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:07,577
You said that.

705
01:04:07,602 --> 01:04:09,437
He's not been sleeping.

706
01:04:09,462 --> 01:04:11,112
You said that, too.

707
01:04:11,137 --> 01:04:13,240
Yeah, well, he is now.

708
01:04:13,265 --> 01:04:15,033
In his chair.

709
01:04:15,058 --> 01:04:17,026
He passed out waiting
for you to play.

710
01:04:17,051 --> 01:04:19,119
What good does that do me?

711
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:22,663
Wait. The door is
still unlocked.

712
01:04:22,876 --> 01:04:25,541
The door is still unlocked.

713
01:04:27,453 --> 01:04:29,488
Do I just go?

714
01:04:29,513 --> 01:04:31,482
There's a combination lock

715
01:04:31,507 --> 01:04:33,576
on the inside of the storm door.

716
01:04:33,601 --> 01:04:36,170
- It was my bike lock.
- Your bike lock?

717
01:04:36,195 --> 01:04:39,089
Yeah. He took it
when he took me.

718
01:04:39,114 --> 01:04:40,848
What's the combination?

719
01:04:40,882 --> 01:04:42,918
- I don't remember.
- Griffin.

720
01:04:42,951 --> 01:04:45,653
I remember being
afraid I'd forget it.

721
01:04:45,686 --> 01:04:47,522
That's why I wrote it down.

722
01:04:47,555 --> 01:04:49,690
What? Where?

723
01:04:49,724 --> 01:04:52,426
I carved it with a
bottle cap in the wall.

724
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:54,629
Which wall? Which wall?!

725
01:04:54,662 --> 01:04:56,597
The one on the right,

726
01:04:56,631 --> 01:04:59,333
about shoulder height
when you're sitting down.

727
01:05:10,632 --> 01:05:13,535
Two, three, three, one, seven.
Two, three, three, one, seven.

728
01:05:13,648 --> 01:05:15,883
Two, three, three, one, seven.

729
01:05:19,462 --> 01:05:21,131
Two, three, three, one, seven?

730
01:05:21,156 --> 01:05:22,324
If you say so.

731
01:05:22,349 --> 01:05:24,725
But is it 23-31-7

732
01:05:24,759 --> 01:05:28,696
or 23-3-17 or 2-33-17?

733
01:05:28,729 --> 01:05:30,260
- I can't remember.
- Griffin.

734
01:05:30,285 --> 01:05:31,686
I can't remember.

735
01:05:31,878 --> 01:05:34,080
You'll have to try them all.

736
01:05:34,105 --> 01:05:36,507
And you'll have to be
very quiet about it.

737
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:38,068
Yeah.

738
01:05:38,173 --> 01:05:40,708
Okay. Thanks.

739
01:05:51,425 --> 01:05:55,229
Two, three, three, one, seven.
Two, three, three, one, seven.

740
01:08:53,368 --> 01:08:55,703
: Help!

741
01:09:02,911 --> 01:09:04,946
Help! The Grabber!

742
01:09:11,543 --> 01:09:13,658
You say
one fucking word...

743
01:09:15,756 --> 01:09:20,162
and I will gut you like a
pig right here in the street.

744
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:25,766
And strangle you with
your own intestines.

745
01:09:44,127 --> 01:09:46,162
Nighty night, naughty boy.

746
01:09:51,469 --> 01:09:53,538
Hey, what was all
that noise I heard?

747
01:09:53,563 --> 01:09:55,206
Samson was
barking at something.

748
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:58,100
It's nothing. Go
back to bed, Max.

749
01:10:14,717 --> 01:10:16,719
Jesus, what the fuck?

750
01:10:16,744 --> 01:10:18,967
I mean, what the fuck?

751
01:10:18,992 --> 01:10:20,698
I ask you for help,
and you give me

752
01:10:20,723 --> 01:10:22,826
these clues that
don't mean anything.

753
01:10:23,158 --> 01:10:26,128
And now this morning, I wake
up without any dream at all?

754
01:10:26,161 --> 01:10:29,064
Seriously, what the
hell is wrong with you?

755
01:10:29,097 --> 01:10:31,266
You let The Grabber
take Finney, right?

756
01:10:31,299 --> 01:10:33,354
And don't tell me that
you don't get involved,

757
01:10:33,379 --> 01:10:36,171
because you've been
giving me these dreams.

758
01:10:40,175 --> 01:10:41,855
Unless...

759
01:10:51,368 --> 01:10:53,736
Maybe you're not even real.

760
01:11:01,683 --> 01:11:03,551
Son of a bitch.

761
01:11:06,181 --> 01:11:07,308
No.

762
01:11:09,504 --> 01:11:12,107
- Fuck you.

763
01:11:12,687 --> 01:11:14,035
Goddamn it.

764
01:11:18,246 --> 01:11:19,699
What?

765
01:11:21,045 --> 01:11:23,247
You gonna say something?

766
01:11:23,272 --> 01:11:25,074
Do you even know who you are?

767
01:11:25,099 --> 01:11:27,968
What the
shit kind of question is that?

768
01:11:27,993 --> 01:11:30,527
Do you even know who you are?

769
01:11:30,852 --> 01:11:32,511
I'm Finney Blake.

770
01:11:32,536 --> 01:11:35,049
Yeah, well, nice to fucking
meet you, Finney Blake.

771
01:11:35,074 --> 01:11:36,264
Right here.

772
01:11:36,298 --> 01:11:38,266
- This is it.
- This is what?

773
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:42,070
The horrifying nightmare end
of your pathetic little life.

774
01:11:42,103 --> 01:11:43,613
Holy shit.

775
01:11:44,306 --> 01:11:46,136
You're Vance Hopper.

776
01:11:46,541 --> 01:11:48,043
I remember you.

777
01:11:48,076 --> 01:11:49,379
You used to scare me.

778
01:11:50,078 --> 01:11:51,346
Trust me, Finney Blake,

779
01:11:51,752 --> 01:11:53,354
if you knew what you had coming,

780
01:11:53,379 --> 01:11:54,983
you'd be fucking terrified.

781
01:11:55,016 --> 01:11:57,352
Today's the day, motherfucker.

782
01:12:28,083 --> 01:12:29,985
Vance, you're gonna
beat your high score.

783
01:12:30,018 --> 01:12:31,785
Of course I'm gonna
do it, dumb shit.

784
01:12:31,819 --> 01:12:33,121
I said I would.

785
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:39,160
Hey.

786
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:42,389
Oh, jackass!

787
01:12:46,551 --> 01:12:47,972
Motherfucker!

788
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:49,565
You fucked with my game!

789
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:51,088
Oh, for Pete's sake.

790
01:12:51,113 --> 01:12:54,011
- Hey.
Come here, bitch.

791
01:13:08,219 --> 01:13:10,471
Don't fuck with me again!

792
01:14:19,327 --> 01:14:21,386
Do
you even know who you are?

793
01:14:21,411 --> 01:14:23,314
What the shit kind
of question is that?

794
01:14:23,339 --> 01:14:24,861
Do you even know who you are?

795
01:14:24,886 --> 01:14:26,129
I'm Finney Blake.

796
01:14:26,154 --> 01:14:28,212
Yeah, well, nice to fucking
meet you, Finney Blake.

797
01:14:28,236 --> 01:14:30,338
Right here. This is it.

798
01:14:31,449 --> 01:14:32,507
This is what?

799
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:34,209
The horrifying nightmare end

800
01:14:34,242 --> 01:14:36,244
of your pathetic little life.

801
01:14:36,277 --> 01:14:38,446
Holy shit.

802
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,320
- You're Vance Hopper.
<i>- </i>

803
01:14:40,348 --> 01:14:42,951
I remember you. You
used to scare me.

804
01:14:47,164 --> 01:14:48,932
Trust me, Finney Blake,

805
01:14:48,957 --> 01:14:51,332
if you knew what you had coming,
you'd be fucking terrified.

806
01:14:51,357 --> 01:14:53,144
Today's the day, motherfucker.

807
01:14:56,464 --> 01:14:59,000
Gwenny, hurry up.

808
01:14:59,033 --> 01:15:01,002
You're gonna be late for school.

809
01:15:01,035 --> 01:15:02,504
Sorry, Daddy.

810
01:15:02,537 --> 01:15:05,106
<i>Holy shit.
You're Vance Hopper.</i>

811
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:07,275
<i>I remember you. You
used to scare me.</i>

812
01:15:07,308 --> 01:15:08,863
<i>Trust me, Finney Blake,</i>

813
01:15:08,888 --> 01:15:10,136
: if you
knew what you had coming,

814
01:15:10,161 --> 01:15:11,446
you'd be fucking terrified.

815
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:14,115
Today's the day, motherfucker.

816
01:15:14,149 --> 01:15:16,985
Have you tried stacking the
carpets to reach the window?

817
01:15:17,018 --> 01:15:18,420
I've tried everything.

818
01:15:18,453 --> 01:15:20,964
No, not everything.

819
01:15:21,113 --> 01:15:23,425
When The Grabber saw what
I had done, that was it.

820
01:15:23,458 --> 01:15:25,326
And he took his
time with me, too.

821
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,636
What did you do?

822
01:15:26,661 --> 01:15:28,439
Oh, that fucker had
to spend a fortune

823
01:15:28,463 --> 01:15:30,331
- to repair all the damages.
- What did you do?

824
01:15:30,365 --> 01:15:32,167
I'm getting to that, cunt wad!

825
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,035
Or do you have some
other important shit

826
01:15:34,068 --> 01:15:35,293
you have to do right now?

827
01:15:35,318 --> 01:15:38,433
No, no, no, no,
I'm... I'm listening.

828
01:15:38,949 --> 01:15:40,351
There's an outlet
in the shitter,

829
01:15:40,375 --> 01:15:41,743
across from the john.

830
01:15:41,776 --> 01:15:43,545
Yeah, I've seen it.

831
01:15:43,578 --> 01:15:46,047
On the other side of that
wall, there's a storage room.

832
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,418
You can't get into that room,

833
01:15:47,443 --> 01:15:49,845
because there's a big-ass
upright freezer in the way.

834
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:50,847
Okay.

835
01:15:50,872 --> 01:15:54,035
Break into the wall about
two feet above the outlet

836
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:56,195
till you get to a panel
with screws in it.

837
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:58,593
Get the panel off,
you're into the freezer.

838
01:15:58,626 --> 01:16:01,062
And then out into
the storage room.

839
01:16:01,095 --> 01:16:03,031
Thank you.

840
01:16:03,064 --> 01:16:04,566
For what?

841
01:16:04,599 --> 01:16:06,367
For helping me.

842
01:16:07,365 --> 01:16:09,267
Helping you?

843
01:16:09,292 --> 01:16:11,228
This isn't about you.

844
01:16:11,253 --> 01:16:15,290
Fuck him...!

845
01:19:35,643 --> 01:19:37,269
What?

846
01:19:37,712 --> 01:19:39,681
Hey, Finn.

847
01:19:39,714 --> 01:19:41,616
What's happening?

848
01:19:42,717 --> 01:19:44,238
Robin?

849
01:19:44,264 --> 01:19:46,600
Hey, buddy. Don't cry.

850
01:19:46,821 --> 01:19:48,556
I'm not.

851
01:19:48,581 --> 01:19:50,129
Yes, you are.

852
01:19:50,154 --> 01:19:52,156
I can see you.

853
01:19:52,181 --> 01:19:54,250
- You can?
- I'm with you.

854
01:19:54,275 --> 01:19:56,511
I've been with you
this whole time.

855
01:19:56,707 --> 01:19:58,386
You have?

856
01:19:58,411 --> 01:20:01,114
A man never leaves
a friend behind.

857
01:20:01,164 --> 01:20:04,293
My dad didn't leave his buddies
behind when he went to 'Nam.

858
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:06,855
That's why he didn't come home.

859
01:20:07,296 --> 01:20:09,365
And I'm not coming home, either.

860
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:11,980
And I'm not going
to leave you behind.

861
01:20:12,312 --> 01:20:14,213
We'll be together again soon.

862
01:20:14,238 --> 01:20:16,507
Fuck that. You ain't
gonna go like I did.

863
01:20:16,532 --> 01:20:18,668
I've tried everything.
Nothing's worked.

864
01:20:18,693 --> 01:20:20,295
- Yet.
- Robin...

865
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,289
Do you remember what I told you?

866
01:20:23,424 --> 01:20:26,594
That I needed to see
<i>Texas Chain Saw Massacre?</i>

867
01:20:26,627 --> 01:20:28,254
Before that.

868
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:32,508
That someday I have to
stand up for myself.

869
01:20:32,533 --> 01:20:35,152
"Someday" is today, Finn.

870
01:20:35,177 --> 01:20:38,113
Today's the day you stop
taking shit from anybody.

871
01:20:39,303 --> 01:20:41,138
I'm not a fighter
like you, Robin.

872
01:20:41,163 --> 01:20:42,365
You couldn't even take him.

873
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:44,492
You've always been
a fighter, Finn.

874
01:20:44,517 --> 01:20:47,353
That's what we have in
common, why we were friends.

875
01:20:47,615 --> 01:20:49,484
You were always afraid
to throw a punch,

876
01:20:49,517 --> 01:20:51,486
but you always knew
how to take one.

877
01:20:51,519 --> 01:20:55,456
And you always got
back up every time.

878
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:57,019
I'm not strong enough.

879
01:20:57,044 --> 01:20:59,393
You have to be. You're
getting out of here.

880
01:20:59,427 --> 01:21:01,662
If you can't do it
for you, do it for me.

881
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:03,168
What does it matter?

882
01:21:03,193 --> 01:21:05,062
Because I don't want
to die for nothing.

883
01:21:05,087 --> 01:21:07,189
I want to at least
have died for a friend.

884
01:21:07,314 --> 01:21:09,249
And because I can't
kill that <i>hijo de puta,</i>

885
01:21:09,274 --> 01:21:11,243
you have to do it for me.

886
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:14,199
How?

887
01:21:14,729 --> 01:21:16,731
You're gonna use a weapon.

888
01:21:16,756 --> 01:21:18,357
What weapon?

889
01:21:18,382 --> 01:21:20,214
The one in your hand.

890
01:21:20,392 --> 01:21:21,627
The phone?

891
01:21:21,816 --> 01:21:23,751
Fill the receiver with dirt.

892
01:21:23,785 --> 01:21:25,300
Pack it in tight.

893
01:21:25,325 --> 01:21:26,627
Give it some heft.

894
01:21:26,652 --> 01:21:28,175
Then what?

895
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:31,236
Then you practice over and over.

896
01:21:31,363 --> 01:21:33,929
You raise the phone.
Take a fast step back.

897
01:21:33,962 --> 01:21:37,379
Step forward, step
back and swing.

898
01:21:37,571 --> 01:21:39,273
- Try it.
- Now?

899
01:21:39,298 --> 01:21:40,633
Yes.

900
01:21:40,658 --> 01:21:43,261
You raise the phone.
Take a fast step back.

901
01:21:43,286 --> 01:21:46,289
Step forward, step
back and swing.

902
01:21:46,324 --> 01:21:49,544
Again. You raise the phone.
Take a fast step back.

903
01:21:49,577 --> 01:21:51,879
Step forward, step
back and swing.

904
01:21:51,914 --> 01:21:54,816
Again. You raise the phone.
Take a fast step back.

905
01:21:54,849 --> 01:21:57,425
Step forward, step
back and swing.

906
01:21:57,450 --> 01:22:00,688
Again. You raise the phone.
Take a fast step back.

907
01:22:00,721 --> 01:22:03,825
-Step forward, step back and swing.

908
01:22:05,994 --> 01:22:07,636
You got it.

909
01:22:07,959 --> 01:22:10,427
Now fill the phone with
dirt like I told you.

910
01:22:10,452 --> 01:22:12,554
Will I still be able
to talk with you?

911
01:22:14,869 --> 01:22:16,798
This was the last call, Finn.

912
01:22:17,330 --> 01:22:19,332
It's all you from here on out.

913
01:22:21,365 --> 01:22:23,267
I miss you, Robin.

914
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:26,259
Then get out for me.

915
01:22:27,129 --> 01:22:29,134
Use what we gave you.

916
01:22:29,531 --> 01:22:31,126
I will.

917
01:22:31,886 --> 01:22:33,494
Bye, Finn.

918
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,601
Bye, Robin.

919
01:23:29,423 --> 01:23:31,545
Please, dear Jesus.
Please, please.

920
01:23:31,579 --> 01:23:32,915
I'm sorry I said
you weren't real.

921
01:23:32,948 --> 01:23:34,615
Please be real. Please.

922
01:23:42,523 --> 01:23:44,533
Please, please, please.

923
01:24:48,619 --> 01:24:50,239
Detective Wright, please.

924
01:27:29,025 --> 01:27:31,178
No fucking way.

925
01:27:33,121 --> 01:27:35,723
I knew that he was hiding
something from me down here,

926
01:27:35,756 --> 01:27:37,993
but holy Mary, mother of God.

927
01:27:38,026 --> 01:27:39,693
Please, help.

928
01:27:39,719 --> 01:27:41,548
C-Can you call my
dad? Call my sister?

929
01:27:41,573 --> 01:27:42,673
Oh, listen. Don't
worry, he's not here.

930
01:27:42,698 --> 01:27:44,166
He-he had to go into work.

931
01:27:44,191 --> 01:27:46,314
Uh, I'm Max, man.
Stay-stay calm.

932
01:27:46,415 --> 01:27:48,236
No wonder he was freaking
out this morning.

933
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:51,173
Hey, you want to know the story
about how I found you, man?

934
01:27:51,206 --> 01:27:53,203
- No, no, no, no...
- Hey, no, no, no.

935
01:27:53,228 --> 01:27:55,043
Don't worry about it. We
can talk about this...

936
01:28:14,964 --> 01:28:16,531
Is this the house?

937
01:28:16,556 --> 01:28:18,139
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

938
01:28:18,164 --> 01:28:20,911
I'd never seen it before
today, except in my dreams.

939
01:28:20,936 --> 01:28:23,238
The tree, the door,
the address, the gate.

940
01:28:23,271 --> 01:28:24,339
Every detail.

941
01:28:24,372 --> 01:28:26,908
Okay. Okay, you-you s-step back.

942
01:28:26,942 --> 01:28:28,842
Stay with her.

943
01:28:30,111 --> 01:28:31,779
Please hurry.

944
01:28:31,812 --> 01:28:33,215
Okay, let's go.

945
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:35,139
Look what you made me do.

946
01:28:36,384 --> 01:28:38,353
You made me kill my brother.

947
01:28:38,386 --> 01:28:40,355
: No.

948
01:28:40,388 --> 01:28:42,296
It wasn't me. I...

949
01:28:42,321 --> 01:28:44,767
He was an idiot.

950
01:28:46,910 --> 01:28:48,979
But he was my idiot.

951
01:28:51,078 --> 01:28:53,163
I'm sorry, Max.

952
01:28:53,931 --> 01:28:56,666
Now I'm gonna have to
put you with the others.

953
01:28:59,407 --> 01:29:02,010
Looks like you'll find those
naughty boys after all.

954
01:29:04,579 --> 01:29:06,847
Open up! Police!

955
01:29:15,357 --> 01:29:17,125
What's up with the phone, huh?

956
01:29:17,158 --> 01:29:18,994
I told you it doesn't work!

957
01:29:21,229 --> 01:29:24,655
Normally, I would use a knife.

958
01:29:26,134 --> 01:29:30,305
But you are special, Finney.

959
01:29:31,803 --> 01:29:33,897
I'm gonna take my time.

960
01:29:34,824 --> 01:29:38,654
I want this to really hurt.

961
01:29:41,901 --> 01:29:44,365
- Samson!

962
01:30:00,509 --> 01:30:02,945
Clear.
Clear!

963
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:07,659
Good boy.

964
01:30:17,778 --> 01:30:20,147
- It's empty.
- It's the wrong house.

965
01:31:45,829 --> 01:31:47,037
It's for you.

966
01:31:48,009 --> 01:31:49,951
Welcome
to the nightmare end

967
01:31:49,976 --> 01:31:51,887
- of your pathetic little life.

968
01:31:52,576 --> 01:31:55,191
You don't
have much time.

969
01:31:56,578 --> 01:31:58,529
Today's the
day, motherfucker.

970
01:31:58,553 --> 01:32:00,598
I can't kill
you, you <i>hijo de puta,</i>

971
01:32:00,623 --> 01:32:02,670
so Finn is gonna do it for me.

972
01:32:02,695 --> 01:32:04,528
Finn's arm is mint!

973
01:32:22,277 --> 01:32:23,344
Wait.

974
01:32:25,398 --> 01:32:26,899
We've got a basement.

975
01:33:14,195 --> 01:33:15,797
It's the missing kids.

976
01:33:15,830 --> 01:33:17,599
This is where he buries them.

977
01:33:18,433 --> 01:33:21,369
I think he kills
them someplace else.

978
01:33:25,406 --> 01:33:27,408
I think you're right.

979
01:35:20,588 --> 01:35:22,624
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey. Come with me.

980
01:35:25,670 --> 01:35:27,495
- Basement.
Basement.

981
01:35:27,528 --> 01:35:29,263
Get the
kids out of here.

982
01:35:52,553 --> 01:35:54,222
Behind the barrier.

983
01:36:14,850 --> 01:36:16,979
:
I am so sorry.

984
01:36:17,012 --> 01:36:18,613
I'm-I'm...

985
01:36:18,646 --> 01:36:21,716
: I'm
so... I'm so sorry.

986
01:36:21,749 --> 01:36:23,651
Please forgive me.

987
01:36:41,769 --> 01:36:43,604
My name is Chief Walker

988
01:36:43,629 --> 01:36:45,293
of the Denver Police Department.

989
01:36:45,318 --> 01:36:47,442
Our community's long nightmare

990
01:36:47,475 --> 01:36:49,950
has finally come to a
bittersweet end tonight

991
01:36:49,975 --> 01:36:52,647
with the rescue of the
missing Blake child

992
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:54,716
but also the discovery
of five bodies

993
01:36:54,749 --> 01:36:57,685
we believe to be the other
missing children in the area.

994
01:36:57,719 --> 01:37:00,588
Here are the facts of the
case by the men who broke it.

995
01:37:00,621 --> 01:37:03,291
- Detective Wright?
- Thanks, Chief.

996
01:37:03,324 --> 01:37:06,427
The perpetrator known as
The Grabber owned two homes,

997
01:37:06,461 --> 01:37:08,596
one where he kept the
victims while alive

998
01:37:08,629 --> 01:37:10,732
and a second empty
home across the street

999
01:37:10,756 --> 01:37:13,059
where he buried them postmortem.

1000
01:37:17,638 --> 01:37:19,674
- Is that him?
- That's him.

1001
01:37:19,707 --> 01:37:21,476
Oh, shit.

1002
01:37:21,509 --> 01:37:23,644
- Did you see him?
- I thought he would be bigger.

1003
01:37:23,678 --> 01:37:25,413
He's the one who
killed The Grabber.

1004
01:37:25,446 --> 01:37:26,490
- That's him.
- No way.

1005
01:37:26,515 --> 01:37:27,825
The Grabber was like
seven feet tall.

1006
01:37:27,849 --> 01:37:29,272
I heard he stabbed him.

1007
01:37:29,297 --> 01:37:32,253
How could that kid
strangle him to death?

1008
01:37:34,178 --> 01:37:36,758
- It was an axe to the head.
- My dad's a cop. I know.

1009
01:37:36,791 --> 01:37:39,427
I heard he beat him
to death with a phone.

1010
01:37:42,497 --> 01:37:44,298
Good morning.

1011
01:37:52,413 --> 01:37:54,248
Hi, Finney.

1012
01:37:56,779 --> 01:37:58,428
Call me Finn.

1012
01:37:59,305 --> 01:38:59,737
