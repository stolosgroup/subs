2
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:05,649
André Polonski,
do you wish to take

3
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,611
Marie-Claire Muller as your wife?

4
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,321
I do.

5
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:15,451
Marie-Claire Muller,
do you wish to take...

6
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:18,829
...André Polonski as your husband?

7
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:20,039
I do.

8
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:22,291
Having answered in the affirmative,

9
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:26,754
by virtue of mutual consent,
I declare you bound,

10
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:30,508
...or re-bound, if I may say so,

11
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,927
by the bonds of matrimony.

12
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,555
Would the witnesses please sign?

13
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,518
Please exchange rings.

14
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,817
They're the same ones.

15
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:54,907
We've laid on a small reception
in the main hall.

16
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:57,034
You seem happy anyhow.

17
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,537
I am.
But it's all for his sake.

18
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,832
I'd have gladly stayed
the way we were.

19
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:05,501
You won't make me believe that.

20
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,630
Why else wait
until Guillaume turned 18?

21
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,091
I know you like my own daughter.

22
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:13,759
I'm no one's daughter.

23
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,220
He seemed the ideal son-in-law,

24
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:19,640
the one who'd take over
Muller Chocolate.

25
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,893
How naive.
Surely he knew Andre was an artist.

26
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,478
And what an artist!

27
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,981
He was already very weak.

28
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:30,401
He'd been fighting illness
for over six months.

29
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:32,361
My father-in-law?

30
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,823
Poor man!
He was obsessed by his chocolates.

31
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,244
He was right to be proud of them.
Success like his is rare.

32
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:42,913
I wasn't the ideal son-in-law.

33
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,418
It's sad to say but he died
before I could disappoint him.

34
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:50,546
He was spared the sorrow
of your divorce.

35
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:52,256
As you say.

36
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,967
Can I fetch you another?

37
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,678
- You're too kind.
- You're welcome.

38
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:06,270
I admire him as a pianist
but, as a man, he bothers me.

39
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:09,773
You're swayed by your affection
for Marie-Claire.

40
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,650
You're mistaken.

41
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:15,321
To be honest, I'm glad
they're giving it another try.

42
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:18,490
That's just like her.
She hates losing.

43
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:21,035
The situation has changed too.

44
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:25,915
Polonski's fame is assured.
And Mika's no longer a little girl.

45
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,710
She's strong-headed,
she'll stand up to him.

46
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,962
She's not eighteen this time.

47
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:36,592
You know they've been living
together for three years now.

48
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:40,095
My dear Dubois,
I'm not partial to gossip.

49
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,598
My father gave me this for you.

50
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:45,851
Thank you, young man.
What's your name again?

51
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:47,186
Guillaume.

52
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:50,481
Will you seek
a career in music too?

53
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,733
I have no talent for it.

54
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:54,693
That's such a pity.

55
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,487
What do you plan to do?

56
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,281
We've always called her Mika.

57
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,034
An administration school?

58
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,245
No, my father hates the idea.

59
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,372
Join us at the factory.

60
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,375
You can take over
from your stepmother.

61
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,001
My stepmother?

62
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,879
She's your stepmother now.

63
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:16,298
I can't think of her that way.

64
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:19,134
He wasn't really playing
like before.

65
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,971
On that recording
after Lisbeth died,

66
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,223
you can tell he's in mourning.

67
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,975
Poor Lisbeth...

68
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:29,895
Bravo for the exhibition
of your mother's photos.

69
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,147
It's a tribute to her talent.

70
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,441
Mika organised everything.

71
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,903
I see now
how good she was at her job.

72
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,490
I agree with Mika.

73
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:44,702
A low-key wedding
is better this time.

74
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,661
It was Andre's idea too.

75
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:49,498
The first one was so luxurious...

76
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:54,128
There were 500 guests.
And look where it got them.

77
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,053
So, how's it going?

78
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,555
Fine. How about you?

79
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,390
If you're happy,

80
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,310
I am too.
But there are too many people.

81
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,022
I think we can slip off soon.

82
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:15,190
Are you two plotting again?

83
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,443
I think Mika wants to leave.

84
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,321
- Whenever you want.
- No, when you want.

85
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:24,575
There's a piano next door.
It's totally out of tune.

86
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,286
Sorry, I have a favour to ask...

87
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:31,540
For the press... A photo.
Just one little photo.

88
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,418
You're the devil incarnate.

89
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:45,262
NIGHTCAP

90
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,551
Where have they got to?

91
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,929
They must be playing a tie-break.

92
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,307
Your son's too gallant.

93
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,393
Let them have their fun.

94
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,190
I'm so glad
you were able to take Axel on.

95
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:24,778
It's changed him completely.
Nothing ever interested him before.

96
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,656
He's found his calling.

97
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:29,408
You'd have done
the same for Jeanne.

98
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:34,663
I don't see how. Jeanne's known
what she wants for a long time.

99
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,915
In any case, he's doing well.

100
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,794
His lab chief loves trainees.
A little too much.

101
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,005
I'm sure Axel can manage.

102
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,966
There's no problem there.

103
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,676
Here they come.

104
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,639
I'll put them in the boot.

105
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,058
Afraid of thieves in Switzerland?

106
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,729
Victor,
I think we can eat at last.

107
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:07,404
You're in no hurry, darlings.
Who won?

108
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:10,449
He won't lob hard
because I'm a girl.

109
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,076
Hurry up, it's 1:15 already.

110
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:16,955
I'll have a salad
with a soft-boiled egg and bacon.

111
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,208
Today's special is lake fish.

112
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,834
I'll have that.

113
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,086
Any heartier fare?

114
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,005
A rib of beef for two?

115
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:25,797
Okay.

116
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:30,302
- Rare, right?
- Yes, very rare.

117
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,392
The Coffee's better down here.

118
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,395
Maybe but your cigarette spoils it.

119
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:44,900
What's my mum like at work?
Not too harsh?

120
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,571
Wonderful, a real pro.
Everyone respects her.

121
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,406
Don't make fun of me.

122
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,034
You've never said what you do there.

123
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,620
- What does he do?
- Experiments.

124
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:59,498
Something practical and useful
at last.

125
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:04,253
Toxin surveys, sample analysis.
I've become indispensable.

126
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,965
Want to see a film tonight?

127
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,259
If you like. What's on?

128
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,094
I have today's paper.

129
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:23,146
Fancy that! Look what I've found.

130
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:27,192
"Marie-Claire Muller
and André Polonski"

131
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,236
"announce their wedding..."

132
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:33,448
Polonski... Isn't he the one
from the clinic?

133
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,244
- What clinic?
- He's a top pianist.

134
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,414
- You must have heard of him.
- What clinic?

135
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,165
When Jeanne was born.

136
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,626
- When I was born?
- What of it?

137
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,838
You know, Louise,
that mix-up they had.

138
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,506
There was no mix-up.

139
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:53,218
A mix-up? Are my origins
shrouded in mystery?

140
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:57,347
She doesn't know?
I've put my foot in it.

141
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:00,642
No, you haven't.
There's just nothing to say.

142
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,020
Mum always has something to say.

143
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,938
Shall I tell you?

144
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,773
You bet!

145
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:11,778
Polonski's child was born
in the clinic on the same day.

146
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,406
His wife,
not this one,

147
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:18,327
gave birth while he was performing
in Lucerne.

148
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,953
Is that right?

149
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,165
Anyway...

150
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:28,670
He rushed to the clinic
and asked to see his child,

151
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:32,299
before seeing the mother.
She was sleeping anyway.

152
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,593
The nurse went to the nursery

153
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,013
and showed you to him

154
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,350
saying,
"You have a lovely daughter."

155
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:45,270
Then he went to see his wife,
she was awake by then,

156
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,148
who told him they had a son.

157
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,526
He started kicking up
one hell of a fuss.

158
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:55,656
Luckily, your father managed
to calm him down. Is that it?

159
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,407
How could that happen?

160
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,951
Babies have a bracelet
with their name.

161
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:04,831
The clinic had run out of bracelets.

162
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:08,043
They wrote the first three letters
of your name.

163
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,587
Pollet and Polonski start the same.

164
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:14,633
It was dark and the nurse
mixed you up, that's all.

165
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,680
I might be Polonski's daughter...

166
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:24,351
It's just like
Life is a Long, Quiet River.

167
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:27,646
Oh, please,
you can't swap a boy for a girl!

168
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:28,814
Really?

169
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,900
You father sorted it all out.
I never knew.

170
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:37,197
Mum, just think,
he's a pianist like me.

171
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:43,036
If Mr Polonski is your father,
I'm not your mother.

172
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:48,291
And you're still studying
to be a pianist, remember.

173
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,627
I'm sorry, mum.

174
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,589
And your father was an artist too.

175
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,759
Yes, I know. I'm sorry.

176
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,264
I forgive you, dear.

177
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,900
- Can I have a cigarette?
- Of course.

178
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,529
Why did I mention all that?

179
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,948
Never mind, the incident's over.

180
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,492
In fact, there never even was one.

181
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:26,538
- Your father will be furious.
- So don't tell him.

182
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:34,421
I need to go into town.
Can I take the paper?

183
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,214
Of course, dear.

184
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:40,010
Don't go dressed like that.

185
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:46,016
Besides, you said you'd practice
every day, even on a Sunday.

186
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,562
See you later?

187
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,106
Yes, I'll call you.

188
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,568
Want me to drive you home?

189
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,570
Do I have a choice?

190
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,534
Can I take the car keys now?

191
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,119
Yes, they're in my pocket.

192
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,414
The papers are in the glove-box.

193
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:54,668
- That's a pretty dress.
- You bought it.

194
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,002
I did?

195
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:03,093
You have corpses on Sundays too?

196
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,345
Life goes on.

197
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,806
Paradoxically, they can't wait.

198
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:44,718
This Jewish gold business
resurfaces every year.

199
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,220
- Before elections.
- What's the use?

200
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:51,099
A prosecutor,
a homosexual and from Geneva...

201
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,269
Excuse me.

202
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,028
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

203
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,030
Don't worry.

204
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,282
You're kind.

205
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,164
Come on.

206
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,079
- I'll take your chocolate up.
- I'll do it.

207
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:57,958
Out of the question.
I see to the chocolate here.

208
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:02,087
I hope you've made less today.
I had to leave half.

209
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,672
I noticed.

210
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,009
Do you mind me playing?

211
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,428
- Is this disturbing you?
- Yes.

212
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,639
I'm sorry.

213
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:18,812
What's that?

214
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,565
- The doorbell.
- Expecting someone?

215
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,235
Was that the doorbell?

216
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,238
I'll go.

217
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,787
Good evening.

218
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,457
I'd like to see Mr Polonski.

219
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,085
Do you have an appointment?

220
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,921
Yes... Well, no, but he knows me.

221
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,882
I'll go and see.
What's your name?

222
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,885
Jeanne Pollet.
Tell him "from the clinic".

223
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,303
All right.

224
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,336
He doesn't know you.

225
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:29,299
Sorry but I can't help that.
What is it you want?

226
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,927
He does know me.
I'll explain to him.

227
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,977
Oh, no! Mika!

228
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:46,441
I've seen you before, young lady.
You were at the gallery.

229
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,027
You were standing outside.

230
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,196
What brings you here?

231
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:56,034
Sorry to burst in like this
but I absolutely had to come.

232
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,663
I could well be your daughter.

233
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:04,626
My daughter?
You're out of your mind!

234
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,461
No, listen to me, please.

235
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:09,547
I was the baby
you saw at the clinic.

236
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:13,051
Of course...

237
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,429
I remember that business.

238
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,808
But I never had a daughter.

239
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,518
Some idiot of a nurse...

240
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:22,977
Yes, I know.

241
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,688
What if they switched us?

242
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,900
They didn't. Your father explained.

243
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,444
A marvellous man. How is he?

244
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,030
- He's dead.
- I'm sorry.

245
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,074
It was a long time ago.

246
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,370
So it was you?

247
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,541
I kissed you that day.

248
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,835
Will you have a drink with us?

249
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,962
I'd like that.

250
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:55,343
You were delightful. You still are
but I wouldn't have known you.

251
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,848
What will you have'? Fruit juice,
white wine, whisky?

252
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,307
Fruit juice, please.

253
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,434
Can you get it, Guillaume?

254
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:07,605
No, Guillaume dear, in the kitchen.

255
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,151
So what do you do?

256
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,486
I'm doing the Budapest competition.

257
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,614
You're a pianist?
That's incredible!

258
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,451
Let's say, I play the piano.

259
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:23,246
I was on the jury two years ago.

260
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,873
Yes, I know.

261
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,126
It's tough. What are you playing?

262
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:33,089
A Bach fugue and prelude, a Chopin
study... They're obligatory.

263
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,676
Liszt is harder.
I've chosen Funérailles.

264
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:38,678
That's a good choice.

265
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,264
But it's full of traps.

266
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:45,643
You mustn't only play it
like a funeral march.

267
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:50,899
If you can pull it off,
you'll triumph.

268
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,359
It's impressive in any case.

269
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,622
And you mustn't try to play it
like some virtuoso.

270
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,348
I'd like to see how you manage.

271
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,143
- Pineapple juice.
- Thank you.

272
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,812
- Come on, show me.
- Dad!

273
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,982
The guests will be here soon.

274
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,359
What?

275
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,530
That's right. It is a little late.

276
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,283
Listen... Your name's Jeanne?

277
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,786
Jeanne,
can you come back tomorrow?

278
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:47,413
Yes, of course. Thank you.

279
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,750
- Call me first.
- I don't want to disturb you.

280
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,128
Not at all, I'll look forward it.
Drink up now.

281
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,465
Something to drink, Mika?

282
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,801
No, thank you, dear.

283
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,263
We'll drink enough later.

284
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,522
By the way,

285
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:13,940
would you like

286
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:17,235
to see the self-portraits
we have of Lisbeth?

287
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,779
Of course.

288
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,114
Can we go UP?

289
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,533
Yes, go ahead.

290
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,118
Come on then.

291
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:28,663
You live in Lausanne?

292
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,832
Yes, Chemin du Languedoc.

293
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:35,044
- Do you believe her?
- I believe her.

294
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,588
What she's saying is true.

295
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:43,011
You're my son and Lisbeth's.
You weren't switched.

296
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,638
- Did you check?
- Of course.

297
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,850
Her father
gave me a thorough demonstration.

298
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,560
It's odd she's a pianist.

299
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,688
If musical talent was hereditary,
we'd know.

300
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:56,607
Don't be ridiculous.

301
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,444
You welcomed her
like one of the family.

302
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:02,196
No, it's not that.

303
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,907
She reminded me of Lisbeth.

304
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:07,410
You think they look alike?

305
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:11,331
No, she just reminded me
of those days.

306
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,167
We were so happy then.

307
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:15,626
You weren't after?

308
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:18,171
After too...

309
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:22,216
How did she fall asleep
at the wheel?

310
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,510
It wasn't suicide, you know.

311
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,929
I don't know. We'll never know.

312
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:30,224
That's the thing I can't stand.

313
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,937
She was beautiful, wasn't she?

314
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,816
A real woman.

315
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,528
A true woman,
if you see what I mean.

316
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:47,116
I could understand André.
I adored her too.

317
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:50,411
It may sound odd
but we were good friends.

318
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,413
Almost like sisters.

319
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,543
Sisters aren't always friends.

320
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:01,798
You're probably right
but we loved each other.

321
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:22,360
I'm so clumsy!

322
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,655
I'll get a towel from the bathroom.

323
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,915
Damn, what an idiot!

324
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,753
You'll ruin your handkerchief!

325
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:46,342
I'm always replacing things I break.

326
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:49,679
It would leave a nasty stain
on a carpet.

327
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:55,393
What a horrible mess!

328
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:58,479
I'll wash your handkerchief.

329
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,356
Please, it's nothing.

330
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,191
Don't be silly.

331
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:06,154
We'll have it washed
for when you come back.

332
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,572
You needn't bother.

333
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:10,158
- I must make amends.
- I'm sorry.

334
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:14,245
You must be joking!
I'm the guilty one, not you.

335
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:28,342
I'll put all this in the kitchen.

336
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,636
Have you got the stopper?

337
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:33,222
For the flask. I left it behind.

338
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:34,724
I'll get it.

339
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:39,979
On the chest.

340
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,607
Have you found it?

341
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:51,157
Here, let me.

342
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:55,203
You're a darling.
I can't believe how clumsy I am.

343
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,371
It happens to me too...

344
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,706
The door.

345
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:01,167
André, can you go?

346
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,419
My hands are full.

347
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:06,547
He invited musician friends,
on a Sunday,

348
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,799
the staff's day off.

349
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,801
Are all pianists so forgetful?

350
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:14,597
I forget things but I'm not
a good enough pianist yet.

351
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:17,391
Excuse me, I'm hopeless.

352
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:20,353
No chocolate tonight,
I spilled the lot.

353
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,902
Miss Pollet, a pianist.

354
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:32,573
We met at the Conservatoire.
You're Dr Pollet's daughter.

355
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:34,617
Your father was a doctor?

356
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:39,330
No, mother's the doctor.
She runs the forensic science lab.

357
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:42,124
A very important lady...

358
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:45,545
- Can you show Jeanne out?
- I'll get my shoes.

359
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,463
Call me tomorrow.

360
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:51,801
I certainly won't forget.
Thank you.

361
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,553
See you tomorrow, dear.

362
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:57,306
With a clean handkerchief.
Here's our number.

363
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,897
Let's have a drink before dinner.

364
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:09,694
I'd forgotten it was Sunday.
But we'll be all right.

365
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:11,946
So, are you happy?

366
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:14,782
I never imagined I could meet him.

367
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,994
Now I'm invited to play,
I'm more than happy.

368
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,497
- This mix-up...
- What about it?

369
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,208
You believe you're his daughter?

370
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:28,045
Of course not!
I'm my parents' daughter.

371
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,132
You never believed it for a second.

372
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:34,510
Of course not.
I just wondered if you...

373
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,931
Funny we have the same birthday.

374
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,602
See you tomorrow perhaps.

375
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,021
Perhaps.
It depends what time.

376
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,988
Can I have some water?

377
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,781
Right away.

378
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,369
What a sight!

379
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,124
Thanks.

380
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:12,381
Your mother really thinks
we're at the movies?

381
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,801
Of course. She's pretty
old-fashioned, you know.

382
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,137
You could tell her.

383
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:19,889
That you're banging me?

384
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:23,059
I hate it when you get vulgar!

385
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,278
If a woman spilled
a flask of chocolate on purpose,

386
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:36,113
what would you think?

387
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,449
Was it really on purpose?

388
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:42,536
- She knew you could see her?
- No.

389
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:46,123
- I saw her reflection.
- Not so simple.

390
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:48,793
In any case, I'm sure.

391
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:51,921
She opened the flask
and knocked it over.

392
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:54,799
What do you think?

393
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:57,760
I've no idea.
I'm not Hercule Poirot.

394
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:00,179
You've got a one-track mind.

395
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:03,432
Was the chocolate for her?

396
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:06,143
No, someone else.

397
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,270
She didn't want them to drink it.

398
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,231
Okay, but why?

399
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,775
Why? How should I know?

400
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,985
To stop them putting on weight.

401
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:16,737
You're impossible...

402
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,698
Or deprive them of a treat.

403
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:22,827
With a mind like that,
you won't last long at the lab.

404
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:26,872
There's only one solution:
The chocolate was poison.

405
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:29,500
Maybe you're going a bit too far.

406
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,752
Who made the chocolate?

407
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,212
I don't know.

408
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,222
What's the matter?

409
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:47,143
Look, I stained it with the stuff.

410
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,521
- Messy, aren't you?
- Oh, come on...

411
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:52,690
Can you analyse it?

412
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:57,445
Hold on, I've only been doing
the job for two weeks.

413
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:00,740
Don't look at me like that.

414
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,286
I'll try but I'm not sure.

415
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:08,038
Can you do it in the morning?

416
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,291
I have to work fast too?

417
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:15,171
I'll try to do it as soon,
as fast and as well as possible.

418
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:17,590
I'll call you.

419
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,259
No, I'll call you once
I've finished.

420
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:25,931
You weren't too bored?

421
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:30,519
Not at all. It was delicious.
I'm going to bed, I'm stuffed.

422
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,396
Shall I make more chocolate?

423
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:36,734
No, Mika, really.
I don't know where I'd put it.

424
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:39,945
- Good night, dad.
- Good night, son.

425
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,239
I need water. How about you?

426
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:44,074
Excellent idea.

427
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,306
Just what I needed.

428
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:11,352
What's that?

429
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:13,354
I'm practising for tomorrow.

430
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:21,487
Liszt's Funérailles.

431
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,742
I haven't played it in ten years.
Well, not so long.

432
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,830
It's what that girl's playing.

433
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,832
I like her a lot.

434
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:36,043
She's pretty and lively.

435
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,170
And very intelligent too.

436
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,381
An awkward situation.

437
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,591
She handled it admirably.

438
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,741
I'll get it, Marielle!

439
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,830
Why aren't you calling my mobile?

440
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:14,415
<i>Oh, come on...</i>

441
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,542
Found anything?

442
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,919
Plenty of benzodiazepine.

443
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:20,588
What's that?

444
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:23,507
It helps you sleep.

445
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:27,261
And can it... Can you die of it?

446
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:31,682
You don't waste time.
You can die of anything.

447
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,310
You'd need one hell of a dose.

448
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:36,061
<i>Is there a lot?</i>

449
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:40,608
I haven't checked the concentration.
I set fire to your sweater.

450
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:43,944
Luckily, I was alone.
They'd have thrown me out.

451
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:47,406
You learn by your mistakes.
You ruined my sweater.

452
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:51,035
I'm kidding, I couldn't care
less about the thing.

453
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:53,954
What was that stuff again?

454
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:57,458
<i>Benzodiazepine.</i>

455
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:01,211
<i>You know what Rohypnol is?
The rape drug.</i>

456
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:05,007
I read about it.
You give some to a girl on the sly.

457
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:08,177
That's easy,
it dissolves in alcohol.

458
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:13,057
You rape her and she can't
remember a thing afterwards,

459
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:14,975
<i>even if it wakes her up.</i>

460
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,228
<i>She never knows she's been raped.</i>

461
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:23,108
No kidding! I hope you haven't tried
that stuff on me.

462
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:27,071
Are you sure
that's what the stuff is?

463
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,616
Not one hundred percent.
But it's similar.

464
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,161
Look, I've got to go.

465
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:37,957
But if you want my opinion,
forget the whole thing.

466
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,691
Benzodiazepine.

467
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,655
The 1999 accounts are approved.

468
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:11,907
That's all then.

469
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:14,493
Excuse me but, first of all,

470
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,997
I'd like to raise
a couple of brief points.

471
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,039
Go ahead, Patou.

472
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:21,083
Thank you. Firstly,

473
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:25,587
I'd like to stress the success
of what I call the "lactoline".

474
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:28,340
An original way of bringing milk

475
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:31,093
directly from the farm
to the factory.

476
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,804
Our milk is incomparably fresh

477
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:37,099
and it saves us time
and money.

478
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:38,684
What's the problem?

479
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:43,355
I'm coming to that.
I observe that, in 1999,

480
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,941
sales of the drinking chocolate

481
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:49,486
invented by your father
show the only rise.

482
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,572
You agree with me there?

483
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:53,574
Carry on, please.

484
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,660
Other sales are stationary

485
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,079
for the fourth year in a row.

486
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,874
And that's despite end-of-year sales,

487
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:04,126
...exceptional, of course,

488
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:06,754
that our industry benefited from.

489
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:09,631
But new centuries are a rarity

490
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:13,052
and I have great fears
for next year.

491
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,887
Let's face the facts:

492
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:18,891
The wide range
of non-chocolate products

493
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:23,771
show disappointing results
and we must learn from this.

494
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:27,441
For our customers,
Muller means chocolate

495
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:29,985
- and nothing else.
- That's in your report.

496
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:34,573
It's wise not to lose sight of that.
I'd also like to mention

497
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,951
the public relations
and sponsoring budget.

498
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:42,039
Given the poor returns,
it should be re-evaluated.

499
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:46,877
My dear, you can't reject
everything related to childhood.

500
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:51,673
People notice and that's bad for us.
It's our stock in trade.

501
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:55,219
Schools, sports clubs,
organisations...

502
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:57,763
You refuse to help any of them.

503
00:34:58,222 --> 00:35:01,725
It would cost a lot less
than your centres.

504
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,977
I'll use my money as I see fit.

505
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,480
It's our money too, in a way.

506
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,899
I know that chocolate

507
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:12,402
secretes endorphines
and so on and so forth.

508
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:16,532
That's no reason to subsidise
only anti-pain centres,

509
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,367
twelve of them to boot,

510
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:21,370
along with the exhibition of photos

511
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:25,124
by Lisbeth Polonski
that I'm not criticising at all.

512
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:26,834
I should hope not!

513
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:28,836
It's simple enough:

514
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,255
People shouldn't suffer.

515
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:33,090
Children suffer too.

516
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:35,717
You could just
offer them chocolates.

517
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:38,137
Your centres bring in nothing

518
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,973
in advertising terms
and cost us a fortune.

519
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,059
I won't touch them.
Please don't insist.

520
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:47,980
However, I think we need
to modernise our packaging.

521
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:50,858
The study results
will soon be available.

522
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:55,320
Keeping up appearances
is all that counts.

523
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:56,655
End of meeting.

524
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,619
Thank God that's over.

525
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:07,875
I fixed that appointment.

526
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:10,377
Very good, thank you.

527
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:18,802
Dufreigne...

528
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:21,180
Yes?

529
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,479
Forgive my insisting like this
but I really must see you.

530
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,732
Of course, Patou.

531
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:34,902
Without fail?

532
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:38,572
- I promise.
- I'm counting on you.

533
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:41,533
Good-bye, dear,
have a nice evening.

534
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,952
Thank you, Patou, you too.

535
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:55,339
Old papa Dufreigne
is getting to be a pain.

536
00:36:58,467 --> 00:36:59,593
My appointment?

537
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,261
At half past.

538
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,138
In twenty-five minutes.

539
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:17,569
Your appointment, doctor.

540
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,114
She's in your office.

541
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,701
Tell Dr Vernay
to take over until six.

542
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:27,120
- Very good.
- I'll call in on him.

543
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:42,219
Dr Pollet?
I'm Marie-Claire Polonski.

544
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:44,429
Thank you for seeing me.

545
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,807
I'm here about Jeanne.

546
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,435
Jeanne?

547
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,063
Yes.

548
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,565
You probably know

549
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:59,069
she came to see us yesterday.

550
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:00,654
Yes.

551
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,156
She didn't bother you?

552
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:06,076
Not at all. It was a surprise

553
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:09,454
but it was a pleasure
to get to know her.

554
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:12,708
Sit down, please.
Would you like some tea?

555
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,794
Well, I wouldn't say no.

556
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:21,842
Nathalie,
could you bring some tea, please?

557
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:24,720
Two cups.
And don't forget the milk.

558
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,014
You can leave after.

559
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,232
You didn't forget the milk?

560
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,076
Is there anything I can do
to help Jeanne?

561
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:51,413
She asked for help?

562
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:55,083
But I believe everyone needs help.

563
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,337
- Milk?
- No milk or sugar, thank you.

564
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:06,678
She doesn't need help.
She just needs to grow up.

565
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:10,140
She could do with a father.

566
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:12,934
She told us he was dead.

567
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:20,317
She seemed upset
about what happened at the clinic.

568
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:23,278
My husband too, in fact.

569
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:31,286
Could she be his daughter?

570
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,958
On an emotional level,
I'm sure she isn't.

571
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:41,088
But, on a professional level,
I know unlikely situations

572
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:42,964
are sometimes real.

573
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,720
So you have doubts?

574
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:51,515
No, just a scientific mind.

575
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:57,229
I suppose you must have checked
blood groups and so on...

576
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,148
My blood group
matches your husband's.

577
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:03,944
Your husband had the same group
as Mrs Polonski... as mine.

578
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:11,785
You all have the same blood group.

579
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:13,870
So there's some doubt.

580
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,622
Not for us.

581
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:19,626
There may have been
for our gynaecologists.

582
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,922
The blood groups are in the files.

583
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:28,176
You left it at that?
Surely your lab could have helped.

584
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:33,306
Things aren't that simple.
I didn't have this lab back then.

585
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:37,644
Above all,
what you suggest is illegal.

586
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:40,856
Only a judge can ask
for such tests.

587
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:45,569
My husband and I had no doubts,
I promise you.

588
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:50,490
Is that why you came?

589
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,536
No, not at all.
André has no doubts either.

590
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:57,122
He was pleased to meet Jeanne.

591
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:00,959
So was I.
I was glad that she came to call.

592
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:03,879
Wonderful.
Would you like more tea?

593
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:07,549
No, thank you.
I've taken up enough of your time.

594
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:12,095
I was just worried about Jeanne.
She seemed bothered by it.

595
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:17,684
It's terrible, I'm always meddling.

596
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:20,270
It's very kind of you.

597
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:25,025
You have wonderful facilities.
Are you State financed?

598
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:29,112
Partly. We have contracts
with private bodies for research.

599
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:31,573
Really? I could finance you then?

600
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:34,159
Yes but I don't see what research...

601
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:37,829
...Muller Chocolate
could require from a crime lab.

602
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:43,376
There's no obvious link but
if you need anything, let me know.

603
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,838
Don't worry about Jeanne.

604
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,508
She manages very well alone.

605
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,635
And she has her mother.

606
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:40,934
Your tempo's better.

607
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:42,519
I played it faster.

608
00:42:42,686 --> 00:42:46,856
That's not the problem.
Did you feel like a good pianist?

609
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:49,401
- Not at all.
- That's okay then.

610
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,862
- Have you heard Arrau's recording?
- I don't think so.

611
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:45,225
It's surprising,
nothing like a funeral march.

612
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:47,852
It is, but in a subtle way.

613
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:52,273
You'll notice if you listen again.

614
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:56,152
Don't try to copy it,
it would be a disaster.

615
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:58,488
I play it very badly.

616
00:44:58,822 --> 00:45:01,908
Not at all.
You're not playing the right way.

617
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:05,954
There's a percussive side to Liszt.
Supple wrists

618
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:09,541
and finger control
have to be forgotten.

619
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:13,336
Try to keep your wrist
as hard as steel.

620
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:17,424
Control has to come
from the arm and forearm.

621
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:22,053
You understand everything.
Well, a fair share of control...

622
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,765
It works for Bartok,
Prokofiev or Stravinsky.

623
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:29,018
Petrushka is astounding
on the piano.

624
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:31,646
Back to work.

625
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,913
Your turn now.

626
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,481
Why do you always make it
the day before?

627
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:18,151
It's better that way, Marguerite.
That's the secret.

628
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:21,488
A convent mother superior
found it out.

629
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,072
Why?

630
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:29,704
The lactic ferments
have time to develop.

631
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,499
If it's all chemistry then...

632
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:53,812
I'll make the Aztecs' chocolate
soon, with turmeric,

633
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:57,273
ginger, cinnamon...

634
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:12,121
- Let me.
- Heavens, no!

635
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:23,675
That's better.

636
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:27,595
The final chord must be
more terse, clear and final.

637
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:30,223
Release the pedal and strike it.

638
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:44,195
I'm not interrupting you?
I've made the chocolate.

639
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:46,990
We've finished for the day.

640
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:50,493
And we've done some good work,
haven't we?

641
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:54,247
That's not up to me to say.
How can I thank you?

642
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:58,459
That's easy. Work on all this
and play it for me tomorrow.

643
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:03,047
Meanwhile, sample Mika's chocolate,
the world's eighth wonder.

644
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:07,218
Where's Guillaume?
He isn't in his room.

645
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:13,099
He went out around three.
Just after Jeanne called.

646
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:17,103
Yes, I called around three.

647
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,731
He's enjoying his holidays.

648
00:48:21,024 --> 00:48:22,984
What's he studying?

649
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:28,781
Ancient languages this year.
I hope it lasts.

650
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:30,950
It Will.

651
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:32,869
Here, Jeanne.

652
00:48:35,163 --> 00:48:37,582
I met your mother this afternoon.

653
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:39,459
You saw my mother?

654
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:43,546
I was very impressed.
What an intelligent woman.

655
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:45,882
And so composed too.

656
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:50,053
She adores you. You're lucky.

657
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:52,305
How come you saw my mother?

658
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:54,641
Well, I asked for an appointment.

659
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:58,436
You've unsettled us a little.
Hasn't she, André?

660
00:48:59,062 --> 00:49:01,689
It was a surprise. A pleasant one.

661
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:06,486
I think it's upset Guillaume
a great deal.

662
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:08,863
I'm sure that's why he's out.

663
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:11,115
That's ridiculous.

664
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:14,160
I know but that's how it is.

665
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:18,957
Drink up before it gets cold.

666
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:27,131
Your mother is as sure as André
about what you told us.

667
00:49:27,924 --> 00:49:29,676
You learnt about it recently?

668
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,179
It must have been a shock.

669
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:37,600
Not particularly.
It was the coincidence mainly.

670
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,853
The fact that I'm a pianist too.

671
00:49:42,522 --> 00:49:43,731
It is amusing.

672
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:48,111
What do you think?

673
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:49,570
Delicious.

674
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:51,698
I'll make some every time.

675
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,245
Get to work. See you tomorrow.

676
00:49:57,412 --> 00:50:01,874
I see André's using
your first name now.

677
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,585
May I do the same?

678
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:08,006
Mrs Polonski, I'd be honoured.

679
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:10,633
Then you must call me Mika.

680
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:14,721
Good-bye, my dear.

681
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:25,148
Finished your act, have you?

682
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:28,901
We were all wondering
where you were.

683
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:32,947
Sure... The little family's worried
about me now?

684
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:34,866
I wanted to see you.

685
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:37,660
Sure... What is it you're after?

686
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:40,496
- Nothing...
- You're pathetic

687
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:43,166
when you try to look like my mother.

688
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:45,710
And when you try to play like dad.

689
00:50:46,294 --> 00:50:50,339
Listen, stupid. Your chocolate
was drugged yesterday.

690
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:54,218
- Are you crazy?
- No.

691
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:57,555
- I swear it's true.
- How do you know?

692
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:59,348
Through my mum's lab.

693
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:01,559
Your mother handled it?

694
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:05,855
No, my boyfriend's a trainee there
and he ran the tests.

695
00:51:06,481 --> 00:51:08,691
What tests? On what?

696
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:11,110
I'd splashed my sweater with it.

697
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:15,239
This is crazy! Why on earth
did you run the tests?

698
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:21,454
I saw your stepmother
spill the chocolate on purpose.

699
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:25,833
Mika? That proves it,
you really are crazy.

700
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:29,670
She made the chocolate herself.
She always does.

701
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:32,381
She'd never let anyone else do it.

702
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:33,883
So?

703
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:38,471
You're trying to say
she drugged it?

704
00:51:38,638 --> 00:51:41,516
I'm just telling you what I saw.

705
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:46,687
That's ridiculous.
I mean, why would she do it?

706
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,524
So, according to you,

707
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,818
she drugged my hot chocolate

708
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:56,280
and then spilled it
to make sure I wouldn't drink it?

709
00:51:59,492 --> 00:52:03,913
There's only one explanation:
You're out of your mind.

710
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:10,753
Believe what you want. I've
warned you, my conscience is clear.

711
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:15,258
I've had all I can take
of the Polonski family!

712
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:16,634
Wait!

713
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,053
Why would she hurt me?

714
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:22,431
She's got my father back now,
she's happy.

715
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:30,898
How did your mother die?

716
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:34,026
She fell asleep at the wheel.

717
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:37,530
You've seen the road up here.
It was fatal.

718
00:52:37,697 --> 00:52:40,074
- Did they do an autopsy?
- Yes.

719
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:43,369
Maybe my mother did it.

720
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:48,749
I don't know. They found
sleeping pills and alcohol.

721
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:52,044
It was my tenth birthday.

722
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:54,630
My father performed that afternoon.

723
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:58,426
When we came back here
for dinner...

724
00:52:58,593 --> 00:53:02,055
You were living here?
Isn't it the Mullers' house?

725
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:08,144
We had no fixed abode.
We mostly lived in hotels.

726
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:14,150
Mika invited us to live here
when we were in Switzerland.

727
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,279
She said that the pianos got bored
without dad.

728
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:21,115
Not only the pianos, I'd say.

729
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:25,286
She'd left a beautiful bicycle
in my room.

730
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:29,290
I fell when I ran back downstairs
to thank her.

731
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:33,836
I really sprained my ankle.

732
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:37,757
I couldn't even use the bicycle.

733
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:43,429
After dinner,
mother had a small cognac.

734
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:47,600
That was a habit:
Every evening after dinner,

735
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:49,936
a small glass of cognac.

736
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:54,690
Then we realised
that dad was out of sleeping pills.

737
00:53:55,024 --> 00:53:57,318
That was a disaster

738
00:53:57,485 --> 00:54:02,073
because clad can't sleep
without pills. He's hooked on them.

739
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,409
So mum decided
to drive into town for some.

740
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:09,330
She went off the edge of the road.

741
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:12,500
Was she taking sleeping pills too?

742
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:16,545
No, never. That's what
no one could understand.

743
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:30,226
Dad wouldn't understand
if you never came back.

744
00:54:30,393 --> 00:54:32,311
You don't know what you want.

745
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:37,066
I can't say yet. I want
to work with him, that's true.

746
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:39,360
I need to think it over.

747
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,114
Take care of yourself.

748
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:23,237
You'll have to get some more.
It's my last one.

749
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:26,782
Don't worry, I'll go tomorrow.

750
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,120
It's all planned.
I need some aspirin too.

751
00:55:38,336 --> 00:55:41,881
I really enjoyed
my session with Jeanne today.

752
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:44,467
Know what?
She makes me young again.

753
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:47,928
I noticed.

754
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:51,265
Does she play well?

755
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,060
She could, without the bad habits

756
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:57,188
that her idiotic teachers
have given her.

757
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:59,523
She's lucky she's met you.

758
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:04,320
Absolutely. Tomorrow, I'll see
if she's understood what I said.

759
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:07,948
I'm reserving my opinion for now.

760
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:13,245
Won't Guillaume be jealous?

761
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:16,540
Jealous? Why would he
be jealous of a student?

762
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:20,294
She didn't come as a student.

763
00:56:20,503 --> 00:56:24,548
That old business.
Think it's still bothering him?

764
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:26,926
What about her?

765
00:56:27,093 --> 00:56:29,303
She never mentioned it.

766
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,974
She could be my daughter.

767
00:56:35,935 --> 00:56:37,937
I'd like to have a daughter.

768
00:56:39,355 --> 00:56:41,690
What if we tried to have one?

769
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,234
Tonight?

770
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:46,320
We can start tonight.

771
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:50,491
No, not tonight, silly.

772
00:56:50,658 --> 00:56:52,576
Why not?

773
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:54,870
You'll doze off on the job.

774
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:56,997
- I won't.
- You will.

775
00:56:57,373 --> 00:57:00,418
You're always in a rush
to take your pills.

776
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,545
Tomorrow then.

777
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:07,842
Tomorrow, if you take
your sleeping pill afterwards.

778
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,138
You're beautiful and reasonable too.

779
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,849
True, I am starting to doze off.

780
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,815
I'm like a kid, aren't I?

781
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,485
Not always.

782
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:30,823
Carry on reading,
it doesn't bother me.

783
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:35,077
No, you're sweet,
but I'm sleepy too.

784
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:36,912
Good night, sweetheart.

785
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:38,330
Good night.

786
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:41,417
Sleep well at least.

787
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:10,089
If you want to make her work,

788
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:13,259
shouldn't she spend
a few days here?

789
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:56,737
Just a second...

790
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:02,868
I need to wake up!

791
01:01:04,745 --> 01:01:07,623
I'm sorry,
the milk was boiling over.

792
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:11,210
Forgive me, doctor.
It's Mika Muller here.

793
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:15,964
My husband is so impressed
by your daughter's talents...

794
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:25,391
I don't know what to say.
Jeanne isn't up yet.

795
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:32,314
I'm sure she'll be flattered
by your husband's opinion

796
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:35,025
but I don't know her plans...

797
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:38,654
That doesn't matter.
She's coming to see my husband.

798
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:42,157
If she wants to stay,
we'll have a room ready.

799
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,577
Board and lodging
along with the music.

800
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:50,499
It will be
a very great pleasure for us.

801
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,880
- You look pale.
- I didn't sleep well.

802
01:01:57,965 --> 01:01:59,800
Breakfast is ready.

803
01:01:59,967 --> 01:02:01,260
Do you ever relax?

804
01:02:01,427 --> 01:02:05,597
I was up. What else could I do?
Make toast if you want.

805
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,104
That was Mrs Muller.

806
01:02:13,147 --> 01:02:15,566
- They've invited you to stay.
- Really?

807
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:18,944
Her husband likes the way you play

808
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:21,905
and wants to coach you a little.

809
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:24,658
He has to go to Germany next week.

810
01:02:24,825 --> 01:02:27,953
Yes, I know...
What did you say?

811
01:02:28,287 --> 01:02:29,872
That I'd tell you

812
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:32,624
but I didn't know your plans.

813
01:02:41,592 --> 01:02:43,260
What do you think?

814
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,805
You're old enough to decide.

815
01:02:47,473 --> 01:02:50,851
I've no idea.
But I feel like accepting.

816
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:54,396
That's that then.

817
01:02:54,605 --> 01:02:56,607
You don't seem pleased.

818
01:02:57,733 --> 01:02:59,818
I'm not an unnatural mother.

819
01:03:01,904 --> 01:03:06,200
I'm glad Andre' Polonski
thinks you're talented. Very glad.

820
01:03:08,494 --> 01:03:12,790
But they want to monopolise you
and you're getting all worked up.

821
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:16,460
You can't manage two days
without your daughter?

822
01:03:16,627 --> 01:03:18,587
Pretentious thing!

823
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:23,175
I hardly ever see you anyway.

824
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:27,137
You're always with Axel,
playing tennis...

825
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,681
or seeing movies.

826
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,685
I want to go.

827
01:03:34,186 --> 01:03:37,773
Go but remember,
you're not Polonski's daughter.

828
01:03:38,023 --> 01:03:41,026
- That's all over.
- I'm not so sure.

829
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:43,070
I know you. I made you.

830
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:45,781
What's that tone?

831
01:03:47,616 --> 01:03:50,160
I'll use the tone I choose.

832
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:52,746
I'll spend two days with them.

833
01:03:58,544 --> 01:04:01,880
I'll never stop you
from doing what you want.

834
01:04:03,966 --> 01:04:07,052
But your father isn't your father.

835
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:08,762
Polonski, you mean?

836
01:04:09,263 --> 01:04:10,514
I didn't say that?

837
01:04:19,314 --> 01:04:21,275
No, you didn't.

838
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:24,570
You said,
"Your father isn't your father."

839
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:40,043
Polonski isn't your father

840
01:04:43,422 --> 01:04:45,173
nor was my husband.

841
01:04:50,721 --> 01:04:52,514
You're telling me this now?

842
01:04:54,433 --> 01:04:56,810
So who is my father?

843
01:04:58,437 --> 01:05:01,356
Jean asked me never to tell you.

844
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:06,069
I didn't agree but I promised.

845
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:08,906
I didn't agree so now you know.

846
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:12,618
Jean was sterile.

847
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:16,747
No doubt about it.
We had to face the truth.

848
01:05:18,707 --> 01:05:20,542
I considered adopting...

849
01:05:22,461 --> 01:05:24,296
But your father chose.

850
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:29,009
He begged me to try insemination.

851
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:33,597
It worked straight away.

852
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:35,349
There you go.

853
01:05:38,018 --> 01:05:40,604
You're my daughter
and Jean loved you.

854
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:43,482
Don't go looking for another father.

855
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:46,318
Sperm straws, was it?

856
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:52,866
He was terrified
you'd hold it against him.

857
01:05:55,327 --> 01:05:59,873
He didn't want people thinking
he was impotent, which he wasn't.

858
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:03,210
Even the clinic didn't know.

859
01:06:11,927 --> 01:06:14,012
It's been hell keeping quiet.

860
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:18,308
I've felt so dishonest with you.

861
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:23,146
Now I feel dishonest with him.

862
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:32,948
Maybe I shouldn't have told you.

863
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,701
You've been keeping a lot from me.

864
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:45,168
It'll do me good to get away.

865
01:06:45,836 --> 01:06:48,714
I'm going, mum.
Don't worry but I'm going.

866
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:01,018
What are you doing?

867
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:02,894
Gathering snails.

868
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:05,772
- Snails? What for?
- To eat.

869
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:08,608
It's the season.

870
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:14,114
We have a guest today.
Your little twin.

871
01:07:14,865 --> 01:07:17,743
Jeanne, your father's student.

872
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:19,494
Really?

873
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:23,040
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

874
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:25,792
Not at all.

875
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:54,488
Mr Dufreigne, please.

876
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,364
It's Mrs Muller.

877
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:00,494
Patou, it's Mika.

878
01:08:01,036 --> 01:08:02,621
Yes, me too.

879
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:04,372
Listen,

880
01:08:04,915 --> 01:08:09,169
if I came by on Sunday,
would that suit you?

881
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:11,838
In the afternoon? Perfect.

882
01:08:12,464 --> 01:08:16,176
I'm delighted.
We'll get everything sorted out.

883
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:21,681
Take care, Patou.

884
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:24,976
Stupid old fart!

885
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:34,611
You don't look too happy about this.

886
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:36,530
It's not that.

887
01:08:37,072 --> 01:08:39,199
Don't ask me anything, okay.

888
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:41,034
Shit!

889
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:43,787
I'm doing you a big favour.

890
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,499
It's no fun, driving you up here.

891
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:50,418
I'd rather spend two days with you.

892
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:53,004
Your mother will be mad at me.

893
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:54,881
Did you see her at work?

894
01:08:55,132 --> 01:08:57,300
Yes, briefly.

895
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:58,927
How was she?

896
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:00,846
Just like you.

897
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:03,056
She was sulking.

898
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:08,395
What's up?
Have you fallen out?

899
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:11,022
Don't ask.

900
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:17,237
She's been a bit heavy-handed.

901
01:09:17,863 --> 01:09:19,865
Oh, come on, she's wonderful!

902
01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:24,578
Where is this place? Berchtesgaden?

903
01:09:34,546 --> 01:09:36,006
You're an angel.

904
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:41,344
I don't know what you're up to,

905
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:45,682
but if you want to return
to civilisation, give me a buzz.

906
01:10:05,619 --> 01:10:08,288
Jeanne, welcome.
Let's get to work.

907
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:38,151
No, you're not there yet.

908
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:41,613
You're trying too hard
and it's obvious.

909
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:44,616
You're loosening up.
It was better before.

910
01:10:44,783 --> 01:10:46,618
Sorry, I don't think I can.

911
01:10:46,785 --> 01:10:49,579
Don't talk rubbish.
Like this.

912
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:17,148
- Don't you feel well?
- I'm fine.

913
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:20,110
This isn't natural for me.

914
01:11:20,277 --> 01:11:24,364
It isn't for anyone. It's all
concentration and hard work.

915
01:11:25,115 --> 01:11:27,284
So concentrate and work hard.

916
01:11:27,993 --> 01:11:30,745
Imagine the sound you want
and make it.

917
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:44,259
There, much better.

918
01:11:52,726 --> 01:11:57,147
Mika says that lunch is ready.
Marguerite's leaving early today.

919
01:11:57,772 --> 01:11:59,190
Stop right there.

920
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:03,236
Time to eat!
I hope you're hungry.

921
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:07,657
All true musicians
have one thing in common.

922
01:12:08,116 --> 01:12:09,534
They love their food.

923
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,625
You don't regret coming to work?

924
01:12:18,043 --> 01:12:20,128
No, not at all.

925
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:24,507
Actually, I'm glad to be able
to get away for a while.

926
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:26,551
Did your mother object?

927
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:29,637
Not exactly, no.

928
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:36,186
Put it on the table,
we'll serve ourselves.

929
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:38,229
I'll get the side dishes.

930
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:39,939
I'll help you.

931
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:50,742
I'll take the vegetables.

932
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:55,038
Clean the sauceboat,
there's a splash on it.

933
01:12:58,124 --> 01:13:00,293
You can go straight after.

934
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:03,546
You angel.
I haven't seen Joseph in ages.

935
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,340
Dessert's in the fridge.

936
01:13:05,507 --> 01:13:07,217
Fine, don't worry.

937
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:10,637
Do you know
Britten's piano concerto?

938
01:13:10,804 --> 01:13:12,472
I think I heard it once.

939
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:17,352
Not one of his best
but truly fascinating for a pianist.

940
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:21,606
The whole piano part requires you
to brush over the notes.

941
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:25,902
It's the exact opposite
of Funérailles.

942
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:28,446
Nothing is ever stressed.

943
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:32,742
And yet the piano part
structures the whole piece.

944
01:13:32,951 --> 01:13:35,703
Have some meat while it's hot.

945
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:40,583
It isn't played often,
because of its qualities.

946
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:43,628
It's thrown plenty of colleagues.

947
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:46,840
Have you ever played it?

948
01:13:46,965 --> 01:13:49,843
Once or twice
but I'm like the others.

949
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:55,014
It's a lot of hard work
for an unsatisfactory result.

950
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,144
You should try it.

951
01:13:59,686 --> 01:14:01,729
Your touch would suit it.

952
01:14:03,898 --> 01:14:05,442
I have other problems.

953
01:14:05,692 --> 01:14:08,570
- You've fought with your mother.
- Why?

954
01:14:08,903 --> 01:14:12,115
Because.
I'm sure you've fought with her.

955
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:15,743
Guillaume, please.
You're being tactless.

956
01:14:16,578 --> 01:14:20,623
I hope it isn't true.
Your mother's a wonderful woman.

957
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:24,043
I don't want to talk about it.

958
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:27,672
- Let's talk about Mozart.
- Andre, please...

959
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,757
Jeanne, listen to me.

960
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:33,928
You never really fall out
with your parents. I was adopted.

961
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:37,265
What's going on?

962
01:14:37,849 --> 01:14:40,643
Everyone knows.
I never knew my real parents.

963
01:14:41,436 --> 01:14:44,147
But I had other parents

964
01:14:44,522 --> 01:14:46,691
who gave me their name and love.

965
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:50,612
I was rebellious at times,
like any girl,

966
01:14:50,904 --> 01:14:55,033
to assert my personality.
Especially alone with father.

967
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:58,745
But I realise now
that we never really fought.

968
01:14:59,204 --> 01:15:01,164
That was impossible.

969
01:15:02,373 --> 01:15:03,833
You understand?

970
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:06,794
- Was it good?
- Delicious.

971
01:15:07,337 --> 01:15:09,255
You can tell Marguerite.

972
01:15:09,797 --> 01:15:11,382
Who wants coffee?

973
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:14,177
- Jeanne?
- No thanks, not for me.

974
01:15:14,344 --> 01:15:16,346
Guillaume, can you help me?

975
01:15:16,513 --> 01:15:19,682
- Let me help.
- Certainly not!

976
01:15:19,933 --> 01:15:22,018
We'll have it in the lounge.

977
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:23,728
Whatever you want.

978
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:27,690
Why didn't you try
the Haskill competition?

979
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:29,108
I wasn't ready.

980
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:30,818
Exactly...

981
01:15:33,947 --> 01:15:36,908
The dishes can wait.
Can you grind the coffee?

982
01:15:46,334 --> 01:15:48,044
Is Jeanne like Lisbeth?

983
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:52,924
My mother? No.
Well, maybe a little.

984
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:55,301
I think she's in love with you.

985
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:56,928
Well I'm not.

986
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:59,639
Pity, you'd make a nice couple.

987
01:15:59,973 --> 01:16:01,099
What?

988
01:16:01,558 --> 01:16:03,726
Her father's dead, your mother too.

989
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:05,562
What of it?

990
01:16:06,813 --> 01:16:08,982
I want everyone to be happy.

991
01:16:09,357 --> 01:16:10,942
You have some funny ideas.

992
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:16,656
Oh my God! I'm so sorry!

993
01:16:16,823 --> 01:16:19,951
Sit down on the chair.
You poor thing.

994
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:22,787
- Hold on, my shawl.
- Jesus...

995
01:16:25,123 --> 01:16:26,833
I'm really sorry.

996
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:33,047
I can't believe I'm this clumsy.

997
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:35,925
I'm really sorry.

998
01:16:39,137 --> 01:16:41,347
Stay here, I'll get a bandage.

999
01:16:41,598 --> 01:16:42,974
Just a second.

1000
01:16:46,019 --> 01:16:48,062
Put this on it for now.

1001
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:50,523
I'll be right back.

1002
01:18:34,794 --> 01:18:35,837
Here we are.

1003
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:39,298
A greased bandage for burns

1004
01:18:39,507 --> 01:18:41,634
and analgesic cream...

1005
01:18:45,847 --> 01:18:48,433
I feel better.
It's stinging less.

1006
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:52,979
It isn't serious
but it still needs bandaging.

1007
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:55,106
Like a real professional.

1008
01:18:56,733 --> 01:18:59,068
I wanted to be a nurse once.

1009
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,903
What's going on?

1010
01:19:01,529 --> 01:19:03,489
I wanted a glass of water.

1011
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:05,658
I've been clumsy again.

1012
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:08,745
I tipped boiling water
over his foot.

1013
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,249
Look at this bandage.
Brilliant!

1014
01:19:13,416 --> 01:19:15,084
- Does it hurt?
- Not now.

1015
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:17,670
- I'm terrible.
- You didn't do it on purpose.

1016
01:19:17,837 --> 01:19:19,922
- You wanted some water?
- For André.

1017
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:21,632
I'll take it to him.

1018
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:32,101
Can you walk?

1019
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:34,228
Of course.

1020
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:37,690
She does nothing by halves.

1021
01:19:37,857 --> 01:19:40,067
Shut up. Don't talk rubbish.

1022
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:44,447
You've scalded your foot?

1023
01:19:44,614 --> 01:19:47,450
- It was my fault.
- He didn't move his foot.

1024
01:19:47,617 --> 01:19:50,578
It's no big deal.
I'll lie down in my room.

1025
01:19:50,745 --> 01:19:52,330
Can you manage?

1026
01:19:52,497 --> 01:19:55,833
I'm okay.
I want to watch the TV for a bit.

1027
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:13,392
I can manage.

1028
01:20:14,811 --> 01:20:18,481
Will smoked salmon and blintzes
be okay for dinner?

1029
01:20:18,648 --> 01:20:19,607
My favourite.

1030
01:20:19,774 --> 01:20:22,527
- Guillaume? Smoked salmon?
- Wonderful.

1031
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:25,905
I'll go into town for it.
Can I take Jeanne?

1032
01:20:26,072 --> 01:20:29,826
Jeanne's not here to shop
but to learn to play the piano.

1033
01:20:29,992 --> 01:20:32,370
Back to work, young lady.

1034
01:21:37,852 --> 01:21:40,313
<i>These yoghurts have bright colours.</i>

1035
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:44,650
<i>Aren't there any
chemical flavourings in them?</i>

1036
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:49,113
<i>No, we make
nature-identical flavourings.</i>

1037
01:21:49,322 --> 01:21:51,741
<i>What do we mean by that?</i>

1038
01:21:51,908 --> 01:21:56,037
<i>They're flavourings
just like natural ones,</i>

1039
01:21:56,454 --> 01:22:00,416
<i>using the same molecules as nature</i>

1040
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:05,922
<i>but instead of nature making them,</i>

1041
01:22:06,172 --> 01:22:08,716
<i>a chemist made these molecules.</i>

1042
01:22:41,624 --> 01:22:44,126
I've found some Danish salmon

1043
01:22:44,377 --> 01:22:48,005
and a bottle of aquavit
for those who like it.

1044
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:50,508
Is Guillaume upstairs?

1045
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:52,468
We haven't seen him.

1046
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:54,387
Jeanne's playing well.

1047
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:56,430
I'm sure she is.

1048
01:23:00,351 --> 01:23:02,019
Are you okay, sweetheart?

1049
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:04,647
Of course, Mika. It's nothing.

1050
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:16,075
I've found two new tapes for you.

1051
01:23:16,409 --> 01:23:20,997
Lang's Secret Beyond the Door
and Renoir's La Nuit du Carrefour.

1052
01:23:21,205 --> 01:23:22,623
Brilliant.

1053
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:26,877
I'm happy then.

1054
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,131
You'll ruin your eyes.

1055
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:32,883
I'll call you down for dinner.

1056
01:23:36,804 --> 01:23:38,222
Let me help you.

1057
01:23:38,389 --> 01:23:39,932
That's kind of you.

1058
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:55,990
You're hardly limping anymore.

1059
01:23:56,157 --> 01:23:59,285
It still hurts
but I'll be fine tomorrow.

1060
01:24:00,327 --> 01:24:04,081
Jeanne's a good pianist.
We had a great session today.

1061
01:24:04,248 --> 01:24:06,459
I heard you upstairs.

1062
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:15,384
Have you enjoyed
your holidays, son?

1063
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:18,179
I don't do much to tire myself.

1064
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:20,222
You can say that again.

1065
01:24:21,807 --> 01:24:24,268
Mika found me two great tapes.

1066
01:24:24,643 --> 01:24:25,895
So you'll forgive her.

1067
01:24:26,062 --> 01:24:29,273
At that rate,
she can scald my foot every day.

1068
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:31,817
What's so funny?

1069
01:24:32,276 --> 01:24:33,402
You.

1070
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:36,822
- Why?
- We love you.

1071
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:38,491
Where's Jeanne?

1072
01:24:38,783 --> 01:24:42,703
She insisted on doing the dishes.
The machine's still broken.

1073
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:44,163
And you let her?

1074
01:24:44,330 --> 01:24:48,667
She wanted to. There are only
four plates plus the cutlery.

1075
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:50,294
Want your chocolate?

1076
01:24:50,461 --> 01:24:51,921
Yes, please.

1077
01:24:53,714 --> 01:24:55,508
You too, Guillaume?

1078
01:24:56,300 --> 01:25:00,096
No, Mika, I'll have coffee tonight.

1079
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:01,972
Well I never!

1080
01:25:03,099 --> 01:25:06,811
Get yourself a cup then.
I only brought one for Jeanne.

1081
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:39,135
I wait on you hand and foot.

1082
01:25:40,845 --> 01:25:42,763
I could have come and fetched it.

1083
01:25:43,681 --> 01:25:45,182
I'm exhausted.

1084
01:25:47,685 --> 01:25:52,398
I'm going to abandon you but
feel free to carry on if you want.

1085
01:25:53,691 --> 01:25:55,818
Mika and Guillaume won't mind.

1086
01:25:55,985 --> 01:25:57,236
Not at all.

1087
01:25:57,903 --> 01:25:59,738
Can I have my Rohypnol?

1088
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:01,198
What?

1089
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:03,284
My Rohypnol, sweetheart.

1090
01:26:04,702 --> 01:26:07,079
Oh my God, I completely forgot!

1091
01:26:08,581 --> 01:26:11,667
I was so upset
about scalding his foot.

1092
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,087
I even forgot the prescription.

1093
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:17,089
What are we going to do?

1094
01:26:17,256 --> 01:26:19,592
I'll pop into town, what else?

1095
01:26:19,758 --> 01:26:23,095
No, don't go out now.
I can go if you want.

1096
01:26:23,262 --> 01:26:27,600
Would you? That's kind.
But you don't know my car.

1097
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:32,062
It's okay, I won a rally last year.
There's a prescription?

1098
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:36,400
I'll fetch it. Drink your coffee,
it'll perk you up.

1099
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:58,589
You take Rohypnol?

1100
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:02,801
Yes but they're banning it soon.
I don't know what I'll do.

1101
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:05,387
I'll come with you.

1102
01:27:05,596 --> 01:27:07,598
There's no need.

1103
01:27:08,474 --> 01:27:10,017
I want to.

1104
01:27:12,436 --> 01:27:15,814
You're really very kind, Jeanne.

1105
01:27:16,607 --> 01:27:19,026
The night pharmacy's
at the station.

1106
01:27:19,443 --> 01:27:21,528
I'm going with her. I know it.

1107
01:27:23,906 --> 01:27:25,658
With your foot?

1108
01:27:26,075 --> 01:27:28,035
I'm not fatally wounded.

1109
01:27:31,121 --> 01:27:32,539
And Jeanne's driving.

1110
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:35,834
I'd prefer him to go with her.

1111
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:40,130
If last time...

1112
01:27:41,215 --> 01:27:42,007
What?

1113
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:47,012
Nothing.
Drive safely, I'm in no rush.

1114
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:51,558
See you later.

1115
01:28:06,949 --> 01:28:08,367
She left her coffee.

1116
01:28:11,704 --> 01:28:13,414
No, she drank it.

1117
01:28:15,666 --> 01:28:17,334
It's Guillaume's then.

1118
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:21,672
Why didn't he want chocolate?

1119
01:28:52,286 --> 01:28:53,662
They've gone.

1120
01:28:55,205 --> 01:28:57,207
She seems to drive well.

1121
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:00,878
She does everything well.

1122
01:29:02,713 --> 01:29:05,507
She must have her faults
like all of us.

1123
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:08,135
She knows what she wants.

1124
01:29:08,302 --> 01:29:11,138
She'll get it.
She's gifted and stubborn.

1125
01:29:12,222 --> 01:29:16,852
When I look at Guillaume,
idling around with no ambition...

1126
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:19,229
He's young.

1127
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:21,607
Give him time.

1128
01:29:22,524 --> 01:29:25,819
At eighteen,
children start to disappoint you.

1129
01:29:26,111 --> 01:29:27,404
That's rubbish.

1130
01:29:36,372 --> 01:29:37,998
You handle it well.

1131
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:39,792
I love this.

1132
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:12,000
What are you doing?

1133
01:30:15,202 --> 01:30:16,370
What are you doing?

1134
01:30:17,538 --> 01:30:19,498
The machine's not working.

1135
01:30:20,082 --> 01:30:21,959
Why are you washing the cups?

1136
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:24,628
To clean them. You know that...

1137
01:30:25,379 --> 01:30:27,589
What are you doing, Mika?

1138
01:30:28,715 --> 01:30:29,758
You can see.

1139
01:30:30,217 --> 01:30:31,718
Yes, I can see.

1140
01:30:32,094 --> 01:30:35,848
And on the night Lisbeth died,
you washed the glasses.

1141
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:39,143
Yes, I washed the glasses.

1142
01:30:40,561 --> 01:30:42,062
I washed the glasses.

1143
01:30:44,148 --> 01:30:46,984
- What's got into you?
- Look at me.

1144
01:30:53,699 --> 01:30:54,950
My God!

1145
01:30:56,326 --> 01:30:58,162
What's her mother's number?

1146
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:02,458
It's in our address book.

1147
01:31:02,666 --> 01:31:04,585
Why did you switch our cups?

1148
01:31:04,877 --> 01:31:07,963
I thought
Mika put something in yours.

1149
01:31:10,466 --> 01:31:12,342
See, you believe me.

1150
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:27,816
Hello, Doctor Pollet?

1151
01:31:28,484 --> 01:31:32,070
It's André Polonski.
I'm calling about Jeanne.

1152
01:31:32,571 --> 01:31:35,115
I can't explain but she's in danger.

1153
01:31:35,324 --> 01:31:39,453
Call her mobile. She's in our car.
Tell her to stop and wait.

1154
01:31:39,745 --> 01:31:41,330
I'll explain later.

1155
01:31:41,497 --> 01:31:45,083
Here's my number... 6161007.

1156
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:50,714
Come here.

1157
01:32:01,934 --> 01:32:03,352
Come here.

1158
01:32:16,782 --> 01:32:18,867
I have a knack for doing wrong.

1159
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:27,167
Look out!

1160
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:32,422
Sorry, I feel as if
I'm going all numb...

1161
01:32:49,398 --> 01:32:51,692
It's wrong when I pervert good.

1162
01:32:53,318 --> 01:32:56,530
The more violent it is,
the more it appears as good.

1163
01:32:58,865 --> 01:33:02,160
I give, I give and I can never ask.

1164
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:05,872
I didn't even ask to live.

1165
01:33:06,039 --> 01:33:10,252
You received life like everyone
else. You can't deny that.

1166
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:17,843
I don't understand.

1167
01:33:21,805 --> 01:33:24,266
I never understand when you speak.

1168
01:33:30,397 --> 01:33:32,858
I know what I am. I'm nothing.

1169
01:33:34,776 --> 01:33:36,028
So...

1170
01:33:37,446 --> 01:33:41,408
What have you done to them?
Tell me what you've done.

1171
01:33:42,242 --> 01:33:44,620
You know how I cherish Guillaume.

1172
01:33:45,412 --> 01:33:47,247
You should tell him.

1173
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,461
Guillaume's like me

1174
01:33:52,836 --> 01:33:54,963
and we're not like you.

1175
01:33:57,758 --> 01:34:00,385
My mother
never thought I was a genius.

1176
01:34:03,055 --> 01:34:04,723
I'm just a hanger-on.

1177
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:09,686
You don't realise how much
you've helped me. Thanks to you I...

1178
01:34:09,978 --> 01:34:12,105
I know, I help everyone.

1179
01:34:13,398 --> 01:34:15,067
I helped Lisbeth too.

1180
01:34:15,734 --> 01:34:17,778
But you adored Lisbeth...

1181
01:34:19,655 --> 01:34:21,823
I let her do what she wanted.

1182
01:34:25,494 --> 01:34:27,829
I only put Rohypnol in her cognac.

1183
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:31,124
Why did you do it?
You loved her...

1184
01:34:32,959 --> 01:34:35,128
That makes no difference.

1185
01:34:38,674 --> 01:34:42,427
Instead of loving, I say,
"I love you," and people believe me.

1186
01:34:47,724 --> 01:34:50,185
I have real power in my mind.

1187
01:34:51,853 --> 01:34:53,563
I calculate everything.

1188
01:35:13,834 --> 01:35:15,544
It's in God's hands...

1189
01:35:19,047 --> 01:35:22,175
I think I need
to feel tired occasionally.

1190
01:35:24,094 --> 01:35:25,554
You understand?

1191
01:35:27,681 --> 01:35:29,891
Why am I telling you all this?

1192
01:35:32,811 --> 01:35:34,855
What have you done to them?

1193
01:35:36,189 --> 01:35:37,149
Who?

1194
01:35:37,357 --> 01:35:38,734
The children.

1195
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:42,154
Nothing.

1196
01:35:43,613 --> 01:35:45,907
Why would I do anything to them?

1197
01:35:52,372 --> 01:35:54,875
I put Rohypnol in the coffee.

1198
01:35:59,963 --> 01:36:00,839
Are you angry?

1199
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:02,716
What a question!

1200
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:04,384
Are you angry?

1201
01:36:05,343 --> 01:36:07,429
You fool everyone.

1202
01:36:12,476 --> 01:36:14,853
Some people fool themselves.

1203
01:36:32,204 --> 01:36:33,497
Oh my God!

1204
01:36:36,583 --> 01:36:37,459
They're dead.

1205
01:36:46,593 --> 01:36:47,761
They're dead?

1206
01:36:50,055 --> 01:36:53,058
No, your luck ran out this time.

1207
01:36:53,683 --> 01:36:56,895
Just damage to the car.
They're not hurt.

1208
01:36:57,229 --> 01:37:00,857
They're at the police station
with Jeanne's mother.

1209
01:37:01,525 --> 01:37:03,360
They'll be coming back soon.

1210
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:56,301
