00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,891
OK, let's try this, please!

3
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,451
Meanwhile, some shepherds

4
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,119
were tending their flocks at night,

5
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,303
when suddenly, an angel
appeared right before them.

6
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:34,593
I bring good news.

7
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,090
For today, in a village, was born...

8
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,009
That's good.

9
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,678
In the city of David,

10
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:47,891
there is born for you a Saviour,
who is Christ the Lord.

11
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,267
I'm sorry.

12
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,436
It's good. Continue.

13
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:55,951
And this will be the sign for you.

14
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,667
You will find a baby wrapped

15
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,159
in cloths and lying in a manger.

16
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,286
The hymn now.

17
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,706
Glory to God in the highest,

18
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,345
and on earth peace among men
with whom He is pleased.

19
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,109
Who is that?

20
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,630
Hey!

21
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,038
- Who is that?
- There!

22
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,614
Over there. Something moved.

23
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,876
- Go and see.
- Yes.

24
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,047
Stop!

25
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,572
Aah!

26
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,499
Sh, sh, sh.

27
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,296
It's all right.

28
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,685
That's my son! Is he all right?

29
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,231
Is he all right?

30
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,640
That's my son!

31
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,142
- Is he all right?
- Yes, yes.

32
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,279
Oh, my.

33
00:09:40,104 --> 00:09:43,121
All right. You're all right.

34
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,485
Thank you.

35
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,821
Don't pedal your way back now!

36
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:52,211
You wrote that the human race
is "unimportant".

37
00:09:53,223 --> 00:09:56,162
Not at all. All I said was
that it's happened before

38
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,456
and it will continue to happen
again and again...

39
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,001
Nothing like this
has ever happened before. Come on!

40
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,253
They're still counting the dead.

41
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,339
Please don't miss my point on purpose.

42
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:10,093
This kind of brutality can be
pursued back to biblical times,

43
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,344
and what I said in my article

44
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,930
was not that the rest of the human race
is unimportant.

45
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:18,560
I only stated that, above all,
it is the self that mustn't be betrayed.

46
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,478
Well, let's look at the Bible, then.

47
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:24,993
I suppose one could say that
Pontius Pilate did not betray his self.

48
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:31,823
Well, that is certainly a banal illustration

49
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:35,702
and one that most scholars
would surely disagree with,

50
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,246
but all right.

51
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:42,250
The tragedy is not only that
Pontius Pilate betrayed his self

52
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,212
but that hundreds in the crowd
before him did betray their selves.

53
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,673
And that's what I wrote
was the tragedy of war.

54
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:52,093
Not that one man has
the courage to be evil.

55
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,982
But that so many have not
the courage to be good.

56
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,767
# Some day in gay Paris

57
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,984
# I will make you marry me... #

58
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,022
Damn it.

59
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:07,567
All right, Charlie.
Looks like you're four behind.

60
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,910
Let's forfeit this awful game.

61
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,200
For your sake. Another?

62
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,743
Why not?

63
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,584
I appreciate the company.

64
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,582
# And I'll do that for you

65
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:27,212
# I love your eyes,
they make me feel so... #

66
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,380
When did that brain of yours get so big?

67
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,132
# You're teasing me

68
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,718
# Why can't we parlez-vous... #

69
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,513
The house isn't so bad!

70
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,140
Lucky man, aren't you, boy?

71
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,060
It's too grand for just the three of us,

72
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,395
- and it's a bit isolated.
- # If you'll do this for me

73
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,190
# Then I'll do that for you,
oui oui, Marie #

74
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,984
Well, it's not too far from me.

75
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,952
I am in Paris less and less now
if I don't have to be.

76
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,824
# Will you do this for me?

77
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,712
- # Oui, oui, Marie #
- Let's see what we have here.

78
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:05,340
And it doesn't seem to be
in such poor shape, does it?

79
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:11,012
We took it off my sister-in-law.

80
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,051
They cleared out at the start of the war.

81
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,735
The house has just been
sitting here empty since they left.

82
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,215
Came with a bad cook and a maid.

83
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:28,314
Ah, I don't know... If we start
to fix something, I think if it's worth it.

84
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,656
Who knows how long we'll be here?

85
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:33,211
It might be a while.

86
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:37,157
Doesn't help you being on the side
of the eternal optimist, does it?

87
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,618
Well, there it is. Already, the French
don't feel what we're proposing

88
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,871
is a harsh enough response.

89
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,831
Well, no European would,

90
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:48,376
regardless of what Wilson
and the Americans are proposing.

91
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,670
The war was fought on their soil.

92
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,590
It's their future
doctors and fathers lost, not yours.

93
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,727
There it is. There it is.

94
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,970
Clemenceau would prefer to have Germany,

95
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,107
the whole goddamn country, dissolved...

96
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,225
Well...

97
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,068
With some patience, it'll be all right.

98
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,113
How's the wife liking it out here?

99
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,284
Took her a week to get over
a bad case of boat sickness,

100
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,995
but she likes it fine.

101
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,326
Happy to be back in Europe, I'd say.

102
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:25,872
I remember her telling Catherine and I that
she lived in Strasbourg for some time, yes?

103
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,751
Mm-hm. Spent much
of her childhood life there, in fact.

104
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,878
She's got memories.

105
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,339
Honestly, I think it's half the reason

106
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,681
Secretary Lansing asked me to come along.

107
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:42,680
She impressed him with her French
at a... a dinner party, something or other,

108
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,399
and he seemed to assume
that I too speak the language.

109
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,743
Little did he know!

110
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:57,195
She's already discovered
the church adjacent.

111
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:00,038
- It'll keep her and my boy occupied.
- Oh.

112
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,168
These are rather peculiar.

113
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,508
Hm...

114
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,417
Well, brother-in-law's in textiles,

115
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,212
and it would seem
he does well for himself.

116
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,005
Textiles?

117
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,047
You and I are in
the wrong business, my friend.

118
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,554
I've never met him.

119
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,266
My wife says he's a Muslim.

120
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,476
It was a bit of a scandal.

121
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,866
The entire property is covered with these
grim little statues, if you hadn't noticed.

122
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:37,566
There's more and more
of them here every year.

123
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,443
It's another reason to get
out of the city.

124
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,428
Mona!

125
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,508
Mona!

126
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,761
You gave her the night off. How was it?

127
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:07,070
Our son's not speaking to me.
He's had an accident.

128
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,977
Everything all right?

129
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:14,522
He's fine. I'll come down in a moment.

130
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,651
We've got company.
Charles drove me back from the city.

131
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,278
Charles?

132
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,165
Charles Marker?

133
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,700
- I thought you were in Germany.
- Not any more. I'm here.

134
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,837
Hello there.

135
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,423
He's been acting out a bit.

136
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:40,434
He had dress rehearsal
at church this evening.

137
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,761
How's his French coming along?

138
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,148
Well, it's certainly better than mine.

139
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,708
You put blood on my dress.

140
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,175
Why would you do that?

141
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,010
Why would you want to hurt anyone?

142
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,426
That was very embarrassing to do
in front of Father Laydu

143
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,179
and all our new friends at the church.

144
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,848
They're not our friends.

145
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,816
Maybe not yet, but they will be.

146
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,071
Do you love them more than me?

147
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,620
The people here in town?

148
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,081
Yes.

149
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,173
What do you mean?

150
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,888
God gave me your father and you.

151
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:14,732
Without Him, there would be no you,
or me to take care of you.

152
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,573
So, you love them more than me?

153
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,034
No.

154
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,912
Say your prayers before bed.
Put your hands together.

155
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,452
Lord, make me an instrument
of Your peace...

156
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,761
- Can I say them in my head?
- Yes.

157
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,029
- Are you finished?
- Amen.

158
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,404
We have a friend downstairs.

159
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,989
You must sleep.

160
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,957
And tomorrow,
you'll apologise to Father Laydu.

161
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,803
You were going to leave
without saying goodbye?

162
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,931
No, of course not.

163
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,819
I just didn't want to disturb you, my dear.

164
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,812
Ah, you've come to join the expatriate.

165
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,949
For the time being, yes.

166
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,568
I thought you were in Germany.

167
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,905
Well, initially it seemed like it was safer

168
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,658
to be in the eye of the storm, over there,

169
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:56,751
but perhaps not the best place
for me to be any more.

170
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:01,832
I don't work for that publication any more,

171
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,710
but I keep myself
busy with several others.

172
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,463
Even doing a bit of writing for myself
every once in a while.

173
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,049
Pleased to hear it.

174
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:15,972
I recently got called out of hiding
to cover the negotiations in Paris.

175
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,849
And voilà, who do I find
walking down the boulevard?

176
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,687
Providing there is something to
eventually celebrate at the end of all this,

177
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:26,148
I suggested we might throw
a party here at the house.

178
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,942
I know a number of very fine people

179
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,778
who'd take any excuse
to come out to the countryside.

180
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,822
Always been a big supporter
of your husband.

181
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:36,033
He knows how I feel generally about
statesmen and their politics.

182
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,590
I do.

183
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,998
Do you both some good
to make some friends while you're out here.

184
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,806
Well, sure, as soon as we are settled.

185
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,138
Do you have plans for Christmas?

186
00:19:49,345 --> 00:19:53,884
No, I... He's already asked me,
and I said I'll think about it,

187
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:58,979
but I generally want to avoid the holidays,
and stay out of the way.

188
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,435
Is everything all right upstairs?

189
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,438
- He's tired.
- What happened?

190
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,482
He threw rocks at someone
after the rehearsal.

191
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,943
What? Why?

192
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,405
I don't know. I was still inside
waiting for him,

193
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:18,367
and a man from town ran after him,
and he ran straight into a tree.

194
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,621
- Is he all right?
- He's fine.

195
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,873
I'm sure it's all right,
he's only a little boy.

196
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,334
He didn't actually hurt anyone, did he?

197
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,669
- No, I don't think so.
- Then it's all right.

198
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,921
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

199
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,550
I'd like to see him next time,
if he's having a better night.

200
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,141
Of course.

201
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:41,515
Well, I'm so happy to...
to see a familiar face.

202
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,278
Thank you. Me too.

203
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,731
Well, I'll leave you both for bed. Er...

204
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,358
Goodbye.

205
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,943
Be safe getting home at this hour.

206
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,238
- Such a vile language.
- Oh, stop it.

207
00:20:56,338 --> 00:21:00,034
Hey. Not too corked
to make it back in one piece, are you?

208
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,842
Hm. No, I'll be perfectly safe.

209
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:08,223
Goodnight to you both.
I'll, er... be in touch.

210
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:21,274
You know his wife
was killed travelling with him.

211
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,200
That's why I didn't ask about her.

212
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,428
I had a bad dream and I wet the bed.

213
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,764
Look at your face.

214
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,976
You wet your bed?

215
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:48,178
I had a dream you weren't there.

216
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,315
I wasn't where?

217
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,113
Wherever I was.

218
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,743
It's all right. I'm right here.

219
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:02,958
Go change your clothes and
I'll come up and change your bedding.

220
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,503
He's really hurt.

221
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,467
When did I give Mona tonight off?

222
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,384
Uh... Yesterday afternoon.

223
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,976
All the same.
He'll want me to tuck him in.

224
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,283
- Hello.
- Get off the bed, darling.

225
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,786
Come and see the snow before it melts.

226
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:38,845
Aah! There we go.

227
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,969
Did you miss me?

228
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:48,138
What's happened
to your handsome little face?

229
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,751
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

230
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,768
Ahh! Stop dragging your feet.

231
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,199
Hey, hey! Come on!

232
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:04,393
- Yes? Good morning.
- Good morning.

233
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,860
We're here to see Father Laydu, please.

234
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,125
Yes, enter.

235
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,620
One of your parishioners
has come to see you.

236
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,133
Ah. Send her in.

237
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,466
Ah, the little troublemaker!

238
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,594
- Good day.
- Good day, Father.

239
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,179
How are you both?

240
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,347
Very well, thank you, Father, and you?

241
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,861
Very well, thank you. Please sit.

242
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:52,566
And the rest of your family?
You are all settling in?

243
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,610
Yes, we're very happy, Father.

244
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:58,454
But we need to hire more help
at the house. It's quite large.

245
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,743
You should speak to
Madame Guibert in the rectory.

246
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,204
She might be of some help.

247
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,670
Thank you, Father.

248
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:11,168
I haven't seen your husband at Mass.

249
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,545
We only have him for a few days
every week.

250
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,632
My husband works as Assistant Secretary
to our Secretary of State.

251
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,134
He's working now with everyone in Paris.

252
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,554
Ah, we have a celebrity among us.

253
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,014
Hardly.

254
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:28,644
I've heard about your husband.
He's English or American?

255
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,730
American.
He works on President Wilson's staff.

256
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,690
Is that so?

257
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,526
Well, he doesn't have much
direct contact with the President.

258
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,743
He works for Secretary Lansing.

259
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,865
Please, sit down.

260
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,672
Take a seat.

261
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:49,888
The Americans are doing
a very honourable thing in this country.

262
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,919
We're very happy to have them here.

263
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,963
We're happy to be here. Thank you, Father.

264
00:30:56,063 --> 00:31:00,509
I... I've brought my son
with me to apologise

265
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:03,220
for the incident last night
at the rehearsal.

266
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,232
Oh, well, I missed it all.

267
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:09,740
Does your son speak French?

268
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,106
My husband preferred
us not to speak it at home.

269
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,774
For fear of being excluded.

270
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:20,070
But he's learning with a girl
from the village who speaks English.

271
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,697
She's been giving him lessons

272
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,700
and is helping him with his lines
for the Nativity play.

273
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,955
Why not you?
You speak very well for an American.

274
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,968
Oh, no, I'm not American.
That would be impressive!

275
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,753
My father is German, actually.
He was a missionary.

276
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,298
My sister and I learned several languages.

277
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,508
I would like my son
to have the same experience.

278
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:45,443
I thought it better he learn from
someone local, someone younger.

279
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:50,851
Well, you must excuse me.
My English is rather poor,

280
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:53,534
not even fit for a child.

281
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:59,286
- You'll translate for me?
- Of course.

282
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,281
You look nervous.

283
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,668
There's no need to be nervous here.

284
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,871
You look nervous. There's no need to be.

285
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:13,623
What happened to his face?

286
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,209
The poor thing.

287
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,676
He was running away
last night and fell down.

288
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,090
Ah.

289
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:26,470
Last night, you were throwing rocks
at people after the performance.

290
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:27,971
Is that right?

291
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,891
- You were throwing rocks...
- Yes.

292
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:34,325
- Ah. You understand me when I speak?
- Sometimes.

293
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,647
Were you angry with someone?

294
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,490
With one of the children
who's in the play with you?

295
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,279
Were you angry at someone?

296
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,917
One of the other children of the play?

297
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,708
Angry at your mother?

298
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,885
Were you upset with me, he asks.

299
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:59,592
Would you answer me
when I speak to you, please?

300
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,106
Will you please answer me, young man?

301
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,889
Father Laydu would like to help.

302
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,226
All he's asking is for you
to answer his questions.

303
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,069
Do you understand his questions?

304
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,822
Look at me.

305
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:27,364
- Do you understand his questions?
- Yes.

306
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:31,458
Good. Would you still like
to participate in the Christmas play?

307
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,621
Yes.

308
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,963
Would you like to make an apology to me?

309
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:42,254
Are you going
to say you're sorry to Father Laydu?

310
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:45,257
I didn't do anything to him.

311
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,842
Stop.

312
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,718
Stop it!

313
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,096
What did he say?

314
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,390
He says he wasn't doing anything to you.

315
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:56,028
He doesn't understand
why I brought him here.

316
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,564
Well, he's a smart boy.

317
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:04,484
Maybe it would be best for him
to address our parishioners directly

318
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,862
at Sunday Mass instead.

319
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,489
In the meantime,
he will have time to think it over.

320
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:13,299
It's not always easy
for a young person being in a new place.

321
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,506
Yes, Father.

322
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:24,309
Leave me be!

323
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,808
Come back!

324
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:30,687
Come back!

325
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,568
Come back, please!

326
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,162
Please!

327
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,629
I'm sorry, Mama.

328
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,926
Thank you for coming so quickly.

329
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,969
Of course. Thank you for the opportunity.

330
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,554
What is your name?

331
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,473
Edith or Edy.

332
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,225
Edith is fine.

333
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:21,102
- And how old are you, dear?
- 24, madame.

334
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,896
Do you have children?

335
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:25,023
Yes, madame, but...

336
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,489
And the father?

337
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,278
He hasn't yet been found.

338
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,280
But we feel that he's still alive.

339
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,916
Oh, my poor dear.

340
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,671
She has an excellent reference
from Madame Guibert.

341
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,705
She's been very kind to me.

342
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,999
She's taken a liking to my boy.

343
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:46,294
- How old is your son?
- 12.

344
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,297
- Hello.
- 12?

345
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,759
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Hello, Adélaide. Not at all.

346
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,469
- Hello.
- Hello.

347
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,013
- I'll show you the kitchen.
- How are you?

348
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,932
Fine. And you?

349
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:02,400
We had quite a week here.
I think he'll be happy to see you.

350
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,772
- He's been upset with me lately.
- Oh?

351
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,857
Why is that?

352
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:10,290
He caused a bit of a stir at our church.

353
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,366
- How was he in the rehearsal?
- He did well.

354
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,785
You did very well with him.

355
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,580
He must be in his room, upstairs.

356
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,387
Come with me.

357
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:27,054
I thought you were playing in your room.

358
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,595
- Hello, Ada.
- Hello.

359
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,772
Where do you want to work?

360
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:35,858
Here's fine.

361
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,014
But there's no desk.

362
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,151
We won't need one for the moment.

363
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:45,395
Well, I'll leave the both of you to it.

364
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,532
I'll be in my room if you need me.

365
00:36:57,507 --> 00:37:00,124
- Were you spying on us?
- No.

366
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:04,122
You weren't listening to our conversation?

367
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,965
- You didn't hear us?
- I heard you.

368
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,055
- Shall we begin?
- Yes.

369
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,341
What's that?

370
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,593
- Nose.
- Whose nose?

371
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,595
My nose.

372
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:21,264
- And this?
- Ear.

373
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,058
- And this?
- My eye.

374
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,061
Mm. Very good. And these?

375
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:28,073
- My eyelashes!
- Very good!

376
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:32,567
I'm a girl and you're a...

377
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,124
A boy.

378
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,999
I am French and you are...

379
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:42,869
Mother says we're citizens of the world.

380
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:43,953
Hm.

381
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,716
Citoyens du monde...

382
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,012
Mm...

383
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,678
Do you know what animal this is,
the word for it?

384
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,806
- It's easy.
- What is it, then?

385
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:05,865
- A lion!
- Good... Very good.

386
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,951
Do you want to take me on a walk?

387
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:38,550
Where's your father today?

388
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,178
I don't know. He's working in the city.

389
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:45,521
Mother says we're lucky we were
welcomed here with him.

390
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:49,367
Other people from home
didn't get to bring anyone.

391
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,147
Do you like it here?

392
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:55,365
- I don't know.
- Do you prefer home?

393
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:00,947
I might prefer home if I were you.

394
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,130
It can be sad here sometimes.

395
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:08,169
What do you say we practise
your monologue for Wednesday?

396
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,220
You know the word "to cut"?

397
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,139
I don't know.

398
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:29,448
- Like, "to cut hair."
- Stop!

399
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,781
- Did I tickle you?
- No.

400
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,791
- Does your mother have you keep it long?
- No.

401
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:43,406
You're a little boy.
You should cut it off.

402
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,463
You'd be very handsome.

403
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,997
I bring good news.

404
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:54,681
For today, in the city of David...

405
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:13,394
It is thanks to all your
constant devotion and prayer

406
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,606
that we may go on to celebrate

407
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:22,247
the end of such
grotesque fighting and violence.

408
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:28,243
Still, it is important to acknowledge

409
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:32,163
that there is no true victory

410
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,802
in this war or in any other.

411
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:41,881
Even if we have lost so much

412
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,724
that it is something
impossible to quantify,

413
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,179
God, who is looking down upon us,

414
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,474
does not want you mourning
only your losses,

415
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:56,104
but the losses of our enemy, as well.

416
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:59,858
It is only human that a response of
forgiveness may feel like surrender.

417
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:04,373
I want to assure everyone that this feeling
is a profoundly misleading one.

418
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:13,913
Right now, in our capital,
leaders from all over the world

419
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:17,750
are gathering
to discuss the potential for peace.

420
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:21,254
- He's speaking about you.
- Our Pope, Benedict XV,

421
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:23,840
will certainly be requesting
a role in the discussions.

422
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,843
...wants to come and discuss with you...

423
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:30,054
Needless to say,
above political and economic arguments,

424
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,396
a higher vision must also be represented.

425
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:37,645
And what more appropriate day for us

426
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,148
to celebrate the birth of our saviour,

427
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:44,538
as we too celebrate
the rebirth of our nation?

428
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:49,084
So, all together, let us pray.

429
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,426
Amen...

430
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:10,021
And now, without further ado,
I give you the children.

431
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,649
Come on.

432
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,367
I'm sorry for throwing rocks at you.

433
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:36,579
I'm sorry for throwing rocks at you.
I'm sorry for throwing rocks at you.

434
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,136
I'm sorry...

435
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,347
I'm sorry...

436
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:43,169
- My dear friend...
- Thank you, Father.

437
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,805
I'm sorry...

438
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:49,509
- Merry Christmas, Beatrice.
- Merry Christmas, Father.

439
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,135
I'm sorry...

440
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:54,524
- So, children, Merry Christmas,
- Merry Christmas, Father.

441
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,141
Merry Christmas, Father.

442
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:00,109
I'm sorry I threw rocks at you.

443
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:07,162
I'm not sure how long I can stand this.

444
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,133
I'm sorry I threw rocks at you.

445
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,378
What's she apologising for?

446
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:29,340
Oh, there was a little incident
at our rehearsal last week.

447
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,429
You seem like a nice little girl,
and I'm certain you are sorry.

448
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,486
I'm not a girl!

449
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,196
Merry Christmas.

450
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:51,994
How are you, dear?

451
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:22,449
My darling.

452
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:06,687
The lion... woken...

453
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,523
Woke.

454
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:12,110
- And immobilise...
- Immobilised.

455
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:16,114
It's old French. Do you understand?

456
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,501
- Yes.
- Go on.

457
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:23,044
...the mouse under his great paw.

458
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:28,265
"What am I going to do with you?"

459
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:35,383
he asked the mouse.

460
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,927
I can't go on.

461
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:39,887
Sure you can.

462
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,765
I'll do it for you.

463
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,652
Listen to my voice. Ahem.

464
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:48,896
One day, whilst the lion was asleep,

465
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:53,991
the little mouse accidentally ran up
one of his outstretched paws.

466
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:59,198
The lion woke and immobilised
the mouse under his great paw.

467
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,743
"What am I going to do with you?"
he asked the mouse.

468
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:07,623
"If you let me leave," cried the mouse,
"I'll make it up to you one day."

469
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:11,711
The lion was so tickled at the idea
of the mouse being able to help him

470
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,723
that he lifted his paw and let him go.

471
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:19,635
Some days later, some hunters
caught the lion in a trap

472
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:24,730
and tied him up with rope
in order to transport him the next day.

473
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:30,605
That night, the little mouse
happened to pass by,

474
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:34,609
and saw the terrible plight the lion was in.

475
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:39,780
The mouse, true to her promise,
helped out the lion.

476
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,999
She gnawed at the rope with
her sharp little teeth and freed the lion.

477
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:48,925
And you see the moral here?
Read that to me.

478
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:55,803
On souvent... besoin de... de...

479
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:01,183
en plus petit que souhaite.

480
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,931
Do you know what that means in English?

481
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:09,116
It means
little friends may prove great friends.

482
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,358
I think that should conclude
our lesson for today.

483
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:18,236
- What do you think?
- Yes. I'm hungry.

484
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:22,323
Well, then, perhaps we should ask
Edith to fix you some food.

485
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:25,291
- Shall I ask her on my way out for you?
- Yes.

486
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:31,040
I'm very impressed with you, you know?

487
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:35,044
Just think back to the first day we met.
Quite an improvement.

488
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:37,505
No, it isn't.

489
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:39,590
Yes, it is.

490
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:44,178
It's going to take time, but you will
arrive at where you are headed.

491
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,315
I will make sure of it.

492
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:44,249
Do you have some fire?

493
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:07,303
- Hello there, chap.
- Oh, dear.

494
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:09,722
You must be famished.

495
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:12,600
I plain forgot to ask for your treat.

496
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,353
Your mother's in town, I believe.

497
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:18,022
I didn't know you were home.

498
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:20,159
Yes, home early.

499
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,833
I returned from
the city just a moment ago.

500
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,164
Give your father a hug.

501
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,744
No thank you, Edith.

502
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:13,458
Thank you.

503
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:19,625
Give us grateful hearts, O Father,
for all thy mercies,

504
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,211
and make us mindful
of the needs of others.

505
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:25,673
- Through Jesus Christ our Lord, amen.
- Amen.

506
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:27,184
Amen.

507
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:40,604
Not hungry, darling?

508
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,946
You said he was famished earlier.

509
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,580
I don't like it.

510
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:52,908
- Nevertheless, finish your food.
- But I don't like it.

511
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,077
I don't like the food here.

512
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:58,038
Neither much do I, chap,
but I will finish it all the same.

513
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,721
We don't want to hurt
Edith's feelings, do we?

514
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:05,087
What is it you do in the city all day?

515
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,520
You know what your father does.

516
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,600
But what does he actually do?

517
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:18,100
It's much too complicated for you to
understand in its entirety, I'm afraid,

518
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,521
but I help our President
of the United States.

519
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:27,662
I am a helper to the President
of the United States of America, you see?

520
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,915
Put that back in your mouth.

521
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,952
Was Ada giving Father
French lessons today?

522
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,884
What's that?

523
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:42,631
Was Ada giving you a French lesson today?

524
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,420
No. I was paying her.

525
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,137
- But it's Monday.
- She asked for an advance.

526
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:55,721
Oh, that's right.

527
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,858
She asked me yesterday.

528
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,333
Do you know what he said to me?

529
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:26,627
You will never believe it.

530
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:29,255
He said, "Mum...

531
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:32,424
"Does it always hurt this much
when we love someone?"

532
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:35,344
Oh... It's not true.

533
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:37,680
I know it's a bit silly, but...

534
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,515
Mona.

535
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:41,277
Excuse me, madame.

536
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,562
He will sit with you
until he finishes his meal.

537
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:46,939
I don't care if it takes all night.

538
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:49,372
- Yes, madame.
- I'm going to bed.

539
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:27,527
May I take a bite?

540
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:42,341
Ugh. Horrible.

541
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:44,548
Disgusting!

542
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,186
Sh. Hm?

543
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:06,279
Do not tell me out.

544
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,658
Eh, la!

545
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:22,590
Eh, la!

546
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:25,126
Aah!

547
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,511
We are offering Trentino

548
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:43,430
and a few other small territories
to Orlando.

549
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:47,524
- Will he be satisfied?
- I doubt it, but we should hope so.

550
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:52,523
I will have to spend
a few nights in the city.

551
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:55,442
I trust you will be fine on your own.

552
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,829
I'm not on my own. I have a full house.

553
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,684
Seven times nine makes?

554
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:30,602
63.

555
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,646
A little bit harder this time.

556
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,362
Nine times nine?

557
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:38,370
81.

558
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:41,248
Very good.

559
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:46,994
What are you doing? That's not right!

560
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:51,039
Why... why would you do that?
Who taught you that?

561
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:53,722
My mother lets me do it all the time.

562
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:56,889
That cannot be true.

563
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:00,924
Please apologise.

564
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:03,061
What did I do wrong?

565
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:09,193
- I think we should stop for today.
- I'd like to continue.

566
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:12,728
No. Not today.

567
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:16,732
You have to apologise when
you make someone uncomfortable.

568
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:20,402
I'm sorry
for making you feel uncomfortable.

569
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:22,539
Hold your hand out.

570
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:34,041
# At the end of the rainbow,
there's happiness

571
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:40,172
# And to find it, how often I try

572
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:43,717
# But my life in the rain

573
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:47,095
# Is a wild-goose chase

574
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,973
# And my dreams have all been denied #

575
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:53,987
THE NEW FEMININE HEALTH AND BEAUTY

576
00:56:55,621 --> 00:57:00,108
# Why have I always been a failure?

577
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:04,452
# What have the reasons been? #

578
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:34,476
Make me an instrument of your peace.

579
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,687
Where there is hatred, let me sow love.

580
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:40,274
- Where there is injury, pardon.
- Where there is doubt, faith.

581
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:42,109
Where there is despair, hope.

582
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:44,361
Where there is darkness, light.

583
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,418
Where there is sadness, joy.

584
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:53,036
O Divine Master,
grant that I may not so much

585
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,622
seek to be consoled, as to console,

586
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:58,041
to be understood, as to understand,

587
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,335
to be loved, as to love.

588
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:03,171
For it is in giving that we receive.

589
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:06,133
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned.

590
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:10,178
And it is in dying that we are born
to Eternal Life. Amen.

591
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,014
Amen.

592
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:16,018
# Chasing rainbows, waiting... #

593
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:18,812
Edith, please serve the first dish.

594
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:25,910
# ...to find a little bluebird in vain

595
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:02,147
# Some fellows look and find the sunshine

596
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:07,527
# I always look and find the rain

597
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:12,074
# Some fellows make a winning sometimes

598
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:16,828
# I never even make a gain

599
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:20,791
# Dee, dee, dee

600
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:29,091
# I'm always chasing rainbows

601
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:34,930
# Waiting to find a little bluebird

602
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:40,867
# In vain #

603
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:33,540
Mother, who are they?

604
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,889
All right, let's call the head.

605
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,640
Well, he just turned up here.

606
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,976
Make sure that you take care of it,
you understand?

607
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,895
I understand. Of course.

608
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:06,897
Excuse me.

609
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:09,034
Pleasure to see you, my dear.

610
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:13,195
Why are all these people here?
It's a holiday.

611
01:01:13,295 --> 01:01:16,281
Orlando and his staff are...
leaving the conference.

612
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:18,492
- What?
- They are going back to Rome.

613
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:20,452
It's chaos in the city.

614
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:22,913
Secretary Lansing sent them home with me.

615
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:26,333
We are gonna be conducting
some meetings out here.

616
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:28,425
- Why here?
- It's private here.

617
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,392
And Wilson doesn't know about this?

618
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:40,180
Uh... Most major policy decisions
he is making by himself.

619
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:45,268
He doesn't consult us except to ask
where some place falls on a goddamn map!

620
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,896
It turns out I am not the only one

621
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:50,732
feeling that diplomacy
has been pushed aside.

622
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,869
Transport...

623
01:01:55,111 --> 01:01:56,988
Listen, it's nothing grave,

624
01:01:57,088 --> 01:02:01,833
we just need our own place where we
can discuss more realistic ideas openly.

625
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:06,838
- It is just a discussion.
- Are there members of the cabinet here?

626
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:11,461
Some might be coming, yes, but please
don't concern yourself with it

627
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,381
- and go upstairs.
- There's also a statement from...

628
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:16,758
Do you realise what trouble
you could all be in?

629
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:20,022
Yes, I'm aware. It's only
for a few days over the holiday.

630
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:27,310
What should we do for lunch?
I can't accommodate all these people.

631
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:30,021
- Where is Mona?
- Don't worry.

632
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:31,815
Everything has been taken care of.

633
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:35,454
Mona is taking care of everything now.
She has plenty of help.

634
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,293
Ah, there you are. Erm...

635
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:52,419
It's still not enough
to cover the region's losses.

636
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:55,547
Shouldn't they feel lucky
to be receiving any aid at all?

637
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:58,717
It's quite far east.
What if they take after the Bolsheviks?

638
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:01,386
Isn't it dangerous to be
throwing money after them?

639
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:05,473
Is anyone here actually concerned
about a communist revolution?

640
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:08,894
- The Old Europe is quite strong, you know.
- No, we do not know.

641
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:14,608
Please enlighten us. If it were so strong,
then why are we here?

642
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:17,068
Marxism seems to have taken a stronghold

643
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,320
over this part of the world.

644
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,822
Don't confuse Marxism with Bolshevism.

645
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:25,257
The Russians have recently ignored
some significant sections of Marx's texts.

646
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:29,581
What he professed was that
"Capitalism must come first..."

647
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:33,585
This brings on industrialisation,
which in turn will bring up a working class.

648
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:36,630
And that working class
will inevitably rise up

649
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:39,674
and an organic communism will take effect.

650
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:44,054
As I see it, it was an attempt at
fortune-telling and not a call to arms.

651
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:46,264
You seem to know a fair lot about it.

652
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:49,392
I am an economist. It is my job
to know a fair lot about it.

653
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:54,564
These debates are healthy!
More importantly, they are necessary.

654
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:57,776
We do appreciate
your education and your position.

655
01:03:57,876 --> 01:04:02,864
I only ask that, as we move forward,
you appreciate ours, as well.

656
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:05,533
Thousands upon thousands further west

657
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:08,967
would be most positively
affected by reparations paid,

658
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:11,623
so I suggest we move on.

659
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:14,125
There is significantly less damage there.

660
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:16,253
Perhaps, but more citizens.

661
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:19,381
In Paris, delegates are coming

662
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:22,384
to ask for countries, colonies.

663
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:24,469
They are coming to ask
for votes for women.

664
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:26,263
But away from all that noise,

665
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:31,601
what we must use this opportunity
to discuss here quietly is coal.

666
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,363
Go.

667
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:38,285
While I have addressed this
in many of my prior presentations,

668
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:44,948
it does not seem to be evident to those
presiding over the negotiations

669
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:47,742
to what extent
Germany is reliant on her coal.

670
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:49,911
If we go after the Saar basin,

671
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:53,581
it will leave Germans with
no way back and nothing to build upon.

672
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:55,667
We go after their coal,

673
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:59,087
it will give them no chance to repay
their debts or rebuild their nation.

674
01:04:59,187 --> 01:05:01,047
Rebuild their nation?

675
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,258
What right do the enemy possibly
have to rebuild

676
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:05,802
while the rest of the
continent is starving to death

677
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,929
and dying of influenza?

678
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:10,765
Wilson preaches peace
without vengeance or victory,

679
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:14,269
but it is just too emotionally removed,
too intellectual.

680
01:05:14,369 --> 01:05:16,730
Where I am in step
with my President, however,

681
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:20,358
is that one way or another,
we will force the world to be a better place.

682
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,575
Mark my words.

683
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:10,075
We can't acknowledge each
community's system of belief.

684
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:11,826
Have you found anything?

685
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,912
This is the best map I could find.

686
01:06:14,012 --> 01:06:17,040
The decision of what places
of faith are reconstructed

687
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,541
and those which are not.

688
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,753
We'll approach this in a secular manner.

689
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:23,310
Excuse me.

690
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:29,511
- Yes?
- Where's Ada?

691
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:32,695
- This must be your daughter.
- My son.

692
01:06:35,833 --> 01:06:39,118
I apologise.
I... I hardly got a look at him.

693
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:43,326
Where were we, gentlemen?

694
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:26,526
May I acknowledge
that there are multitudes

695
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:29,209
of different faiths living
within this region?

696
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:33,464
Who is to say how one group
should be favoured over another?

697
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:38,163
Or what that economic division
could do to their community?

698
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:41,082
I'm willing to accept
your point about faiths.

699
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:43,970
- But the legal framework...
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

700
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:49,347
...the region doesn't
leave much room for...

701
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:59,197
Why aren't you dressed?

702
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:07,531
- Mona!
- Mona!

703
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:11,994
Go to your room.

704
01:08:13,965 --> 01:08:15,922
Go to your room.

705
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:41,976
What in the hell are you doing in here?

706
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:43,520
The boy's running around naked!

707
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,688
- I'm sorry... I don't.
- I have people here!

708
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,997
People I'm working with,
and he's running around naked!

709
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:52,247
- The boy?
- Yes.

710
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:55,949
What's the word in French?

711
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:58,159
Look, just go upstairs
and tend to him. Go!

712
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:00,296
- Yes.
- God damn it.

713
01:09:07,769 --> 01:09:09,886
Darling. It's me.

714
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:18,735
Open the door, dear.

715
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:25,019
- What's going on?
- Oh!

716
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,313
I don't know, madame.

717
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,899
The little one had a quarrel with his father.

718
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:33,653
Something about how he was dressed.
And now he won't come out.

719
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:35,989
Leave him alone, then.

720
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:39,457
And stop making so much noise.
I have a terrible migraine.

721
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:57,061
Darling. It's only me.

722
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:00,606
I have something for you.

723
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:09,153
- What are you doing in here, chicken?
- Thank you.

724
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:11,858
Should I put you to bed?

725
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:15,153
No, thank you. Come back tomorrow morning.

726
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:16,869
OK.

727
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:21,492
- Mona?
- Yes.

728
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:25,051
- Can you bring me something?
- Yes, sir.

729
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:03,169
Ah, good evening...

730
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:07,997
Darling, we're leaving shortly.

731
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,583
We've had some good news, perhaps.

732
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:14,921
I'm not yet sure how long
I need to be in the city,

733
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:17,183
but I will get in touch when I can.

734
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,106
Yes, dear.

735
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:32,195
While I'm away, put the boy straight.

736
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:36,699
I want him how he used to be.

737
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:40,122
I'll see to it.

738
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,715
Here comes the lads right now.

739
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:10,685
You know what I think?

740
01:12:10,785 --> 01:12:12,729
I'm not feeling well.

741
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:14,445
Sh.

742
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:19,068
I want another child.

743
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,862
- What?
- I want another one.

744
01:12:20,962 --> 01:12:25,502
Maybe a little girl
who's your spitting image.

745
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:32,091
- I can't, for my health.
- You are perfectly healthy.

746
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:36,467
Mm.

747
01:12:38,563 --> 01:12:40,173
Having him...

748
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:42,310
it nearly killed me.

749
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:48,987
S-Stop.

750
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,576
I'm bleeding.

751
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:58,538
- I could make you, you know?
- I'm sorry, I...

752
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:07,992
I'm leaving.

753
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:11,085
I've lost the notion. Goodbye.

754
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,731
Madame?

755
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:43,075
Tell him he won't be fed
until he's dressed and out of his room.

756
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:48,167
Yes, madame.

757
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:10,680
- Hello?
- Yes?

758
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:12,612
Darling, it's Ada.

759
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:17,905
Can you open the door for me?

760
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:22,733
We have our lesson today, remember?

761
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:24,449
I'm busy.

762
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:30,831
Come back in three days.

763
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:56,350
Excuse me, do you have a moment?

764
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,066
Mm-hm.

765
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:03,034
I went up to his room
and he refused to see me.

766
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,624
He told me to come back in three days.

767
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:09,623
I'm not surprised.

768
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:13,659
I'd say come back in three days, then.

769
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,716
No cause to negotiate.

770
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:21,208
Yes, madame.

771
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,336
He will be bored by then.

772
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:26,099
If not, we'll starve him out of there.

773
01:15:33,696 --> 01:15:35,312
Adélaide?

774
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,106
Yes?

775
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:42,908
Do you know of any reason
why he may be acting this way?

776
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,998
Not that I know of, no.

777
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:51,703
I only ask because of something
he said several weeks ago.

778
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:58,464
No.

779
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:02,881
Anyway.

780
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:06,973
Would you be so kind
as to mail these letters for me?

781
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:17,362
Thank you. That will be all.

782
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:22,359
We look forward
to seeing you in three days.

783
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:41,288
One day, whilst the lion was asleep,

784
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:48,713
the little mouse accidentally ran up
one of his stretched paws.

785
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:51,146
Stretched. Outstretched.

786
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:26,344
- Is it good?
- Yes, thank you.

787
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:34,518
Mona.

788
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:39,597
What did I ask you?

789
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:41,098
I'm sorry, madame.

790
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:44,362
But he was very hungry.
He's just a little boy.

791
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:47,938
It's not your job to act as his mother.

792
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:50,316
It's your job
to carry out my instructions,

793
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:52,485
because I know what's best for my son.

794
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:55,696
He's a big boy
and he needs to learn how to behave.

795
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:58,991
Yes, madame. I'm very sorry.

796
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:01,285
I'm afraid that will not suffice.

797
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:05,675
You immediately went behind my back
and deliberately went against my will.

798
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:08,209
We care about you very much here, Mona.

799
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:10,050
I'll be sorry to see you go.

800
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:16,634
It won't happen again, madame.

801
01:18:16,734 --> 01:18:20,387
This is a very difficult situation,
but it's too late for discussion.

802
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:22,820
- Come with me.
- Oh!

803
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:38,503
- Why was she crying?
- Oh, I've got your attention now.

804
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:42,409
Mona won't be with us any more.

805
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:44,842
No! Aah!

806
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:01,393
Mona.

807
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,463
Please, madame.

808
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:26,676
Please.

809
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:33,387
Please, madame.

810
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:38,007
I don't have a family.

811
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:40,718
I've been with this house for 17 years.

812
01:19:40,818 --> 01:19:42,901
And you have been with us
for just four months.

813
01:19:56,792 --> 01:20:02,379
I will devote every day
of my waking life to destroying your family.

814
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:09,343
You can show yourself out.

815
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:14,585
Oh, excuse me, madame.
I did not mean to bother you.

816
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:16,768
You too. Out.

817
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:19,506
S-Sorry?

818
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:21,939
You'll make everyone here sick. Out. Out!

819
01:21:03,817 --> 01:21:05,934
Darling, it's me again.

820
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:19,163
Darling, would you please
open the door for me?

821
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:23,529
Can you fetch my mother?

822
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:25,621
Yes, of course.

823
01:21:35,265 --> 01:21:37,257
You have something to say to me?

824
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:42,308
I would like to read this story for you.
I've been working very hard on it.

825
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:46,176
Oh.

826
01:21:46,276 --> 01:21:49,690
I thought you might be ready to come
outside and apologise to me.

827
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,977
Ahem.

828
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:58,272
One day, whilst the lion was asleep,

829
01:21:58,372 --> 01:22:04,664
the little mouse accidentally ran up
one of his outstretched paws.

830
01:22:07,798 --> 01:22:12,995
The lion woke and immobilised
the mouse under his great paw.

831
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:17,583
"What am I going to do with you?"
he asked the mouse.

832
01:22:17,683 --> 01:22:23,505
"If you let me leave," cried the mouse,
"I'll make it up to you one day."

833
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:27,509
The lion was so tickled at the idea
of the mouse being able to help him

834
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:32,181
that he lifted his paw and let him go.

835
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:36,268
Some days later, some hunters
caught the lion in a trap

836
01:22:36,368 --> 01:22:41,523
and tied him up with rope
in order to transport him the next day.

837
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:45,194
That night, the little mouse
happened to pass by,

838
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:49,573
and saw the terrible plight the lion was in.

839
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:55,496
The mouse, true to her promise,
helped out the lion.

840
01:22:55,596 --> 01:23:00,432
She gnawed at the rope with
her sharp little teeth and freed the lion.

841
01:23:01,435 --> 01:23:02,920
And the moral is...

842
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:06,513
"Little friends may prove great friends."

843
01:23:11,612 --> 01:23:15,557
That was very good, my love. Impressive.

844
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:17,851
Yes, that was...

845
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:19,988
That was great.

846
01:23:21,872 --> 01:23:24,149
Well done.

847
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:25,984
It's not my doing.

848
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:29,196
Shall I continue or are you satisfied?

849
01:23:29,296 --> 01:23:31,504
No, that was very good, dear.

850
01:23:33,926 --> 01:23:37,715
Well, then, I'd like to continue
studying on my own.

851
01:23:41,642 --> 01:23:44,430
I won't be needing Ada any more.

852
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:54,899
Very well, then.

853
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:58,573
Why don't you step out with me, dear?

854
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:12,448
I just need a few minutes.

855
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:16,132
What do you say we get some clothes
on you and some food in your belly?

856
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:57,757
Did you know that I speak
four languages fluently?

857
01:25:12,983 --> 01:25:15,010
When I was your age,

858
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:17,602
I was still
travelling the world with my family.

859
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:22,281
I never once expected
to find myself in New York,

860
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:25,485
but there I was when I met my husband.

861
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:29,034
I had no interest in being married.

862
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:36,171
In fact, my aspirations
were quite in line with yours, I think.

863
01:25:38,759 --> 01:25:40,994
But he wouldn't give up.

864
01:25:41,094 --> 01:25:43,757
He asked and he asked...

865
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:47,135
and he never gave up.

866
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:52,140
Do you want to be a teacher, Ada?

867
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:55,477
What?

868
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:58,226
In life?

869
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:02,321
Is this your aspiration? To teach?

870
01:26:03,283 --> 01:26:04,899
Yes, ma'am.

871
01:26:08,372 --> 01:26:11,661
You don't want to get married,
have children of your own?

872
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:14,987
No, ma'am.

873
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:17,170
Good.

874
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:21,003
This is for you.

875
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:58,878
Wouldn't you like to make some friends?

876
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:03,327
What do you do up there, all by yourself?

877
01:27:03,427 --> 01:27:05,089
What do you do?

878
01:27:09,599 --> 01:27:12,919
Until I get someone here
looking after you again,

879
01:27:13,019 --> 01:27:16,048
I'm afraid you will have
to bear my company.

880
01:27:16,148 --> 01:27:17,764
It's fine.

881
01:27:24,114 --> 01:27:28,560
Would you like to go outside and
breathe some fresh air together?

882
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,697
I need to study.

883
01:27:41,298 --> 01:27:45,243
I had a thought that you and I
could be friends again.

884
01:27:45,343 --> 01:27:47,380
I'm going to my room.

885
01:27:48,555 --> 01:27:50,332
How about tomorrow?

886
01:27:50,432 --> 01:27:53,085
- It's meant to rain through the week.
- Really?

887
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:55,222
What makes you think that?

888
01:27:59,566 --> 01:28:01,478
What makes you think that?

889
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:50,694
Sir. Come in.

890
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:08,326
Ah.

891
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:10,245
There he is. The man of the hour!

892
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:12,831
Charles. What are you doing here?

893
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:15,584
I've just heard the news.
I came to congratulate you.

894
01:29:15,684 --> 01:29:17,721
What news is that?

895
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:22,013
The Germans have been summoned.

896
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:26,772
A final treaty in the series
is being drafted now.

897
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:30,821
Well, that is wonderful news.

898
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:34,728
I suppose we'll have to have that party.

899
01:29:34,828 --> 01:29:36,911
It means we can go home.

900
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:40,330
Where's our son?

901
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:44,707
- In his room.
- In his room? Where's Mona?

902
01:29:45,839 --> 01:29:48,158
I let her go.

903
01:29:48,258 --> 01:29:51,751
You were right.
She was making the situation worse.

904
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:55,842
He's just a little boy.

905
01:29:57,142 --> 01:30:00,931
You cannot allow a child
to run this household.

906
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:37,926
Open this door.

907
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:42,430
Open this door, I said!

908
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:48,520
Answer me when I speak to you!

909
01:30:52,948 --> 01:30:57,739
I am sick and I am exhausted
with your games.

910
01:30:58,828 --> 01:31:01,147
I am your father,

911
01:31:01,247 --> 01:31:05,833
and you will show some respect to me!

912
01:31:11,549 --> 01:31:14,286
If you do not answer...

913
01:31:14,386 --> 01:31:16,423
If you do not open this door,

914
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:22,554
I will give you a lashing
like you've never received!

915
01:31:26,856 --> 01:31:28,597
I will count to three.

916
01:31:29,651 --> 01:31:31,643
One... One!

917
01:31:33,446 --> 01:31:35,278
Two...

918
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:40,158
Three.

919
01:31:50,672 --> 01:31:53,506
Come here! I've had enough of this!

920
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:58,244
We are going... Come here!

921
01:32:01,266 --> 01:32:04,502
- We are going on a trip!
- Ah!

922
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:08,214
- We are going to Versailles!
- Ah!

923
01:32:08,314 --> 01:32:11,718
Now you will put your clothes on
for this trip!

924
01:32:11,818 --> 01:32:13,935
No!

925
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:15,258
What's your name, dear?

926
01:34:15,358 --> 01:34:16,968
Julie, madame.

927
01:34:17,068 --> 01:34:19,025
Julie, how far along are we?

928
01:34:21,114 --> 01:34:23,600
I'll have a look
in the dining room, madame.

929
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:25,111
Thank you.

930
01:34:42,552 --> 01:34:44,204
Oh, now!

931
01:34:44,304 --> 01:34:46,136
That's not right.

932
01:34:48,141 --> 01:34:50,383
That's not what I asked for.

933
01:34:57,317 --> 01:34:59,928
Very good. I'm excited to try this.

934
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:03,442
The kitchen's on the left, down the stairs.
Follow me.

935
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:26,824
# Now, won't you listen, honey

936
01:37:26,924 --> 01:37:29,507
# While I say... #

937
01:37:38,353 --> 01:37:40,797
Obviously, that's good, right?

938
01:37:40,897 --> 01:37:42,934
It's beautiful, anyway.

939
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:48,972
Eriksen, it was a complete delight
to finally meet your better half.

940
01:37:49,072 --> 01:37:50,688
Pardon me...

941
01:37:57,580 --> 01:38:00,275
You must be very proud of your husband.

942
01:38:00,375 --> 01:38:04,039
We are. And of his colleagues, of course.

943
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:09,795
- Here. It would be lovely...
- It's nice to meet you.

944
01:38:12,387 --> 01:38:14,872
Laura is a reporter as well.

945
01:38:14,972 --> 01:38:17,292
- Is that so?
- I was thinking...

946
01:38:17,392 --> 01:38:19,585
Well, not like Charles.

947
01:38:19,685 --> 01:38:21,963
I cover society events.

948
01:38:22,063 --> 01:38:25,898
Well, I do hope you enjoy the party.

949
01:38:50,925 --> 01:38:52,712
Hello there, little one.

950
01:38:55,012 --> 01:38:56,799
Hello, there.

951
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:27,320
Excuse me.

952
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:29,707
- What is it?
- I'm hungry.

953
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:32,418
We'll eat in a moment.

954
01:39:38,514 --> 01:39:40,631
What are you doing there?

955
01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:44,475
Come with me.

956
01:40:52,630 --> 01:40:58,494
# I shall find it how often I try

957
01:40:58,594 --> 01:41:01,928
# But my eye didn't blink... #

958
01:41:04,892 --> 01:41:07,545
You're on the other side with me, darling.

959
01:41:07,645 --> 01:41:09,839
- I prefer it here.
- Up, up, up.

960
01:41:09,939 --> 01:41:12,633
Excuse me. I will gladly take his seat.

961
01:41:12,733 --> 01:41:15,100
- Oh. That's very kind of you.
- Of course.

962
01:41:16,737 --> 01:41:18,399
Lucky you.

963
01:41:19,782 --> 01:41:21,819
How nice to see you. So...

964
01:41:37,967 --> 01:41:39,869
Hello again, everyone.

965
01:41:39,969 --> 01:41:45,666
Thank you very much for joining us
for this celebration tonight.

966
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:49,851
And thank you, my dear,
for arranging such a lovely party.

967
01:41:52,815 --> 01:41:57,512
Tonight, we celebrate
the end of the Great War.

968
01:41:57,612 --> 01:41:59,444
Hear, hear!

969
01:42:02,575 --> 01:42:05,228
I'm not much up for a speech,

970
01:42:05,328 --> 01:42:07,813
so I will spare you that.

971
01:42:07,913 --> 01:42:12,735
Instead, I'd like to call on my wife
to guide us all in a short prayer.

972
01:42:12,835 --> 01:42:14,292
Darling...

973
01:42:25,222 --> 01:42:28,215
Why don't you lead us
in a prayer, my love?

974
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:34,048
He's much less terrified than I
of public speaking.

975
01:42:34,148 --> 01:42:37,141
He was wonderful
in a performance our church put on.

976
01:42:43,449 --> 01:42:44,735
No.

977
01:42:45,868 --> 01:42:48,952
- Just a short prayer.
- I don't believe in praying any more.

978
01:42:51,874 --> 01:42:55,117
- Why would you say that?
- I don't believe in praying any more.

979
01:42:55,836 --> 01:42:59,031
- Take him upstairs.
- I don't believe in praying any more!

980
01:42:59,131 --> 01:43:01,826
- You! Stop it!
- I don't believe in praying any more!

981
01:43:01,926 --> 01:43:04,161
I don't believe in praying any more!

982
01:43:04,261 --> 01:43:08,416
I don't believe in praying any more!
I don't believe in praying any more!

983
01:43:08,516 --> 01:43:10,334
I don't believe in praying any more!

984
01:43:10,434 --> 01:43:13,254
- I don't believe in praying any more!
- Get down and come with me.

985
01:43:13,354 --> 01:43:15,715
- I don't believe in praying any more!
- I'm sorry.

986
01:43:15,815 --> 01:43:17,852
- Prescott, get down!
- No!

987
01:43:21,612 --> 01:43:23,148
Come here!

988
01:43:41,632 --> 01:43:43,868
Come here.

989
01:43:43,968 --> 01:43:46,120
It's all right, it's all right.

990
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:48,007
It's all right.

991
01:43:48,973 --> 01:43:50,416
Come here.

992
01:43:50,516 --> 01:43:52,627
Come on, come here. Come with me.

993
01:43:52,727 --> 01:43:54,920
Aah!

994
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:56,886
- No!
- Here!

995
01:43:58,190 --> 01:43:59,271
Get back!

996
01:44:04,405 --> 01:44:05,862
Stop!

997
01:44:06,699 --> 01:44:08,684
Come back here!

998
01:44:08,784 --> 01:44:11,322
No! Let me go!

999
01:45:00,169 --> 01:45:02,832
It's all right, it's all right.

1000
01:47:38,410 --> 01:47:40,493
Mr Secretary...

1001
01:47:42,039 --> 01:47:44,156
Thank you, Councillor.

1002
01:47:49,922 --> 01:47:51,663
Mr Advisor.

1003
01:47:53,425 --> 01:47:55,291
Thank you, gentlemen.

1004
01:48:04,395 --> 01:48:06,227
Mr Deputy.

1005
01:48:07,064 --> 01:48:09,101
Thank you, Mr Advisor.

1006
01:48:28,043 --> 01:48:32,629
Well, after all that,
I thought we might run out of ink.

1007
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:35,422
Next order of business?

1008
01:48:36,593 --> 01:48:40,748
The security details surrounding
his tour of the facilities.

1009
01:48:40,848 --> 01:48:42,249
Mr Advisor?

1010
01:48:42,349 --> 01:48:45,669
Security has already checked
on safety hazards.

1011
01:48:45,769 --> 01:48:48,923
There's only one in and one out.

1012
01:48:49,023 --> 01:48:51,091
How many workers present?

1013
01:48:51,191 --> 01:48:54,730
- 448 in total.
- That's dwindled.

1014
01:49:05,289 --> 01:49:07,149
I concur.

1015
01:49:07,249 --> 01:49:09,081
Very well, then.

1016
01:49:10,669 --> 01:49:13,662
- Send in my secretary, please.
- Yes, sir.

1017
01:49:16,341 --> 01:49:17,618
Next?

1018
01:49:17,718 --> 01:49:22,790
As reflected in executive order 13084,

1019
01:49:22,890 --> 01:49:27,586
the coordination of the individual
deployment plans have been executed.

1020
01:49:27,686 --> 01:49:32,341
The further working out of mobilisation
preparations for state and people,

1021
01:49:32,441 --> 01:49:35,678
and of the mobilisation
of top authorities is underway.

1022
01:49:35,778 --> 01:49:38,055
- Good.
- For this purpose,

1023
01:49:38,155 --> 01:49:41,016
I advise the secretary's office
of the defence committee

1024
01:49:41,116 --> 01:49:45,156
to compose a committee of specialists
from... from all ministries.

1025
01:49:46,330 --> 01:49:48,816
Should that be added to section G?

1026
01:49:48,916 --> 01:49:50,782
Most definitely.

1027
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:52,736
Yes, sir?

1028
01:49:52,836 --> 01:49:56,615
The Councillor has requested
that we please be well assured

1029
01:49:56,715 --> 01:50:01,078
of secured access in and out
of the facilities on the 14th of May.

1030
01:50:01,178 --> 01:50:03,664
Yes, sir. I will arrange
a second inspection.

1031
01:50:03,764 --> 01:50:05,916
Would everyone like to attend?

1032
01:50:06,016 --> 01:50:08,053
I think that would be best, yes.

1033
01:50:09,311 --> 01:50:10,337
Yes.

1034
01:50:10,437 --> 01:50:13,896
- Will that be all, sir?
- Yes, thank you.

1035
01:50:17,236 --> 01:50:20,014
Sounds to me like they're arriving now.

1036
01:50:20,114 --> 01:50:22,151
Shall we, gentlemen?

1037
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:58,937
- Useful.
- Well...

1038
01:51:05,492 --> 01:51:08,860
That is the biggest problem we have,
that nonetheless...

1039
01:51:33,937 --> 01:51:36,215
Nice, nice round...

1040
01:51:36,315 --> 01:51:38,352
However, there is no way...

1041
01:51:48,452 --> 01:51:50,990
He's right. He's right. He's exactly right.

1042
01:52:01,965 --> 01:52:04,002
Certainly can't get enough of that.

1043
01:52:09,723 --> 01:52:11,760
Start small, and...

1044
01:53:39,146 --> 01:53:41,388
Stop the car.

1045
01:53:58,332 --> 01:54:00,369
I'll walk from here.

1045
01:54:01,305 --> 01:55:01,750
