00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:48,788
Mr. Dobson,

3
00:04:48,864 --> 00:04:51,489
it's time for us to do what
the Good Lord would refer to

4
00:04:51,564 --> 00:04:53,860
as a "cleansing of the wicked,"

5
00:04:53,931 --> 00:04:56,726
and what my brother George,
God rest his soul,

6
00:04:56,798 --> 00:04:59,525
used to call
"100% Alabama ass kickin'."

7
00:05:00,998 --> 00:05:02,988
So you think we're gonna
die here today?

8
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:06,758
Dying's not an option.
Now, you stick that back

9
00:05:06,832 --> 00:05:09,355
in that gray matter of yours
and you make that stick,

10
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:12,023
'cause any other thought's
gonna get you cold-slabbed,

11
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:15,792
toe-tagged and mailed home to your
mom in a plastic bag. Are we crystal?

12
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:18,127
- Crystal, sir.
- Gentlemen!

13
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,858
Let's do what
God made us to do.

14
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:27,494
This is Sheriff John Quincey Wydell...

15
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:31,226
of the Ruggsville County
Sheriffs Department.

16
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,323
You're completely surrounded!

17
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,066
You have no chance of escape!

18
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:41,833
Now would be the time
to vacate the premises peacefully.

19
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:47,793
There's a million
fucking cops!

20
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:49,697
Come on.

21
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,597
Otis, the fucking pigs
are everywhere!

22
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:54,293
- Tell me something I don't know!
- We've gotta do something!

23
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:57,562
You're completely surrounded.
You have no chance of escape.

24
00:05:57,635 --> 00:05:59,601
Can't take the car,
about 25 pigs.

25
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:02,031
I know, I know!
Shit fuck shit fuck!

26
00:06:02,101 --> 00:06:03,930
Shit.
Where the fuck is Tiny?

27
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:05,797
- I ain't seen Tiny.
- Tiny!

28
00:06:05,868 --> 00:06:08,699
- I think he went out last night.
- Everybody shut up!

29
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:20,662
Mama, what's the matter?

30
00:06:20,736 --> 00:06:25,065
I keep thinking
about... old times...

31
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,261
like when you was
a fuckin' baby.

32
00:06:28,336 --> 00:06:31,166
- You looked like an angel.
- I know, Mama.

33
00:06:31,236 --> 00:06:34,225
- You told me that a million times.
- Yeah.

34
00:06:34,303 --> 00:06:36,166
Gentlemen!

35
00:06:38,137 --> 00:06:39,659
On the count of three!

36
00:06:39,737 --> 00:06:41,897
- Ready?
- Yeah.

37
00:06:42,938 --> 00:06:45,199
- One!
- I love you, Mama.

38
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,794
- I love you, Baby.
- Two!

39
00:06:49,771 --> 00:06:51,237
Let's go.

40
00:06:57,337 --> 00:06:59,099
Three!

41
00:07:03,704 --> 00:07:05,897
Fucking pigs!

42
00:07:12,505 --> 00:07:14,404
Stupid motherfucker!

43
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:20,203
Die, you fuckers!

44
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,904
- You okay?!
- Yeah, are you?

45
00:07:33,973 --> 00:07:35,166
Fuck!

46
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,365
- Ready?
- Yeah yeah yeah, go go!

47
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:48,541
Wydell:
Man down!

48
00:08:09,642 --> 00:08:12,039
- Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!

49
00:08:12,108 --> 00:08:14,199
Dobson! Get some tear-gas
in that house!

50
00:08:14,275 --> 00:08:16,104
Sir!

51
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:56,677
Mama!

52
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:03,609
Let's go! Let's go!

53
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,238
Do not fucking move!

54
00:10:19,216 --> 00:10:22,148
I advise you
to lower that weapon.

55
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:26,015
I'm sorry, Sheriff,

56
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:28,072
but you ain't gettin' me.

57
00:10:30,818 --> 00:10:33,375
Looks like you ain't
gettin' off that easy,

58
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,416
huh, bitch?

59
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,826
All right, everybody listen up.

60
00:13:23,893 --> 00:13:26,791
I want this place gone over
with a fine-tooth comb.

61
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,258
Wherever these fuckers are,

62
00:13:29,327 --> 00:13:32,122
- they gotta be close.
- I am standing outside the perimeter

63
00:13:32,194 --> 00:13:35,354
of what is turning out to be
the most horrific crime scene

64
00:13:35,427 --> 00:13:37,688
since Jack the Ripper
stalked the streets of London.

65
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,226
What police have uncovered
reads like this...

66
00:13:40,295 --> 00:13:43,261
words can't describe it...

67
00:13:43,328 --> 00:13:45,657
"Human skulls
used as ornaments,

68
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:49,160
body parts stuffed
in refrigerators. "

69
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,353
And I can't believe
what it says here:

70
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:53,621
"A mass grave
of decomposing bodies

71
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:56,320
dumped under the crawlspace
of the house. "

72
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:03,553
Hey, Chief, you might wanna
check this out.

73
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:06,595
- What?
- I don't know.

74
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:10,327
Jesus H Christ.

75
00:14:10,396 --> 00:14:12,362
Motherfucker.

76
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:15,953
What, you recognize the clown?

77
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,962
Yeah, his name is Spaulding,

78
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,996
Captain fucking Spaulding.

79
00:14:21,597 --> 00:14:25,188
Oh, yeah! Ooh, yes!
Gimme... give it to me!

80
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:27,161
- Yeah.
- Yeah yeah.

81
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,753
Yeah, ride the horse, baby!
Ride it!

82
00:14:28,831 --> 00:14:32,194
Ride it! Yeah yeah yeah.

83
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:37,529
God! Oh, yeah, honey.
Oh-ho!

84
00:14:37,597 --> 00:14:39,529
- Give it to me.

85
00:14:39,597 --> 00:14:41,756
- Oh, yeah. Yeah! Oh, yeah!
- You're the captain.

86
00:14:41,831 --> 00:14:44,126
- Come on, baby.
- Yeah yeah yeah...

87
00:14:44,197 --> 00:14:46,164
Oh, ride me, baby.
Ride it, ride it.

88
00:14:46,231 --> 00:14:48,493
Ride it!
Feels so good!

89
00:14:48,565 --> 00:14:51,031
Yeah! Yes, give it!
Give it up! Give it!

90
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,927
Give it, give it!
Yeah! Oh!

91
00:14:52,998 --> 00:14:56,486
Come on, baby, ride it home!
Yeah yeah yeah...

92
00:14:56,566 --> 00:14:58,725
- Yes! Yeah!
- Yeah, oh!

93
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:18,798
Ah! Oh, honey!

94
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:20,628
You gettin'
a good ride tonight.

95
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:26,489
Next time, you gonna
have to pay me.

96
00:15:28,434 --> 00:15:30,490
Did you just call me
a fucking whore?

97
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:33,056
Well, I calls 'em
like I sees 'em.

98
00:15:33,134 --> 00:15:35,100
Really?

99
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,928
You think I'm
a fucking whore?

100
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,159
I don't think it,
I know it.

101
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:45,560
- Whore this, fucker.
- Hey hey hey hey!

102
00:15:45,633 --> 00:15:47,463
Come on now, baby,
hold on.

103
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:49,591
I'm just messing with ya.
You know us clowns,

104
00:15:49,668 --> 00:15:53,795
we like to just fool around
a bunch, you know? Come on.

105
00:15:59,536 --> 00:16:02,797
- Yeah.
- Laugh.

106
00:16:04,102 --> 00:16:06,000
Clown... laugh!

107
00:16:10,902 --> 00:16:12,300
Poopy.

108
00:16:14,436 --> 00:16:16,493
What's the matter,
bad dream?

109
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,729
Yeah, 50-50.

110
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:20,769
You want to fool
around some more?

111
00:16:20,837 --> 00:16:23,531
Oh, Jesus Christ, woman,
I gotta take a piss.

112
00:16:23,604 --> 00:16:25,593
- No.
- Didn't you get enough ass-banging

113
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:28,694
last night?
God damn it, my dick is still sore.

114
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:30,794
- Oh, come on, I'm horny.
- No.

115
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:32,962
Most guys like
that quality in a girl.

116
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,662
Yeah, except you acting like some
kinda spastic mongoloid in heat.

117
00:16:42,038 --> 00:16:44,004
- Fuckin' bitch.
- Hurry!

118
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,336
Spaulding: Ah...

119
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:50,738
Where is it?

120
00:16:50,805 --> 00:16:53,236
Just calm down,
it'll be on in a minute.

121
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:55,864
Ah! Ha ha!
There it is!

122
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,303
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

123
00:16:58,372 --> 00:17:01,304
- Yeah.
- You look so sexy.

124
00:17:01,372 --> 00:17:05,702
Captain Spaulding again. I'm here to
tell you about a brand-new attraction.

125
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:09,206
Mary... the monkey.
Oh yeah, that's right.

126
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:11,068
- Ha! That fuckin' monkey.
- This here little monkey

127
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,401
...is half real human, half monkey...
- I love that monkey.

128
00:17:13,472 --> 00:17:16,234
...I brought all the way
from the wilds of Borneo.

129
00:17:16,307 --> 00:17:20,069
When y'all come in, make sure you bring
little Johnny and Suzie with you.

130
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,129
She'll scare
the holy guacamole out of 'em.

131
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,764
Ha ha! And remember
while you're down here,

132
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,739
pick up a "Captain Spaulding
for president" T-shirt

133
00:17:28,807 --> 00:17:31,739
all shapes and...

134
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:34,035
Hey, what the fuck is this?

135
00:17:34,107 --> 00:17:36,232
I paid good money for
this goddamn commercial!

136
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,239
Sheriff, "News Update,"
what is the situation now?

137
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:42,035
The situation?

138
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:44,073
Now what?
God damn it!

139
00:17:45,474 --> 00:17:47,441
- What are you...
- Yeah, what?

140
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:49,134
- Daddy, you gotta get outta there.
- Why?

141
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:52,334
- The pigs hit us this morning real bad.
- Shut the fuck up!

142
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:57,068
- They're gonna be coming for you too.
- All right, just calm down.

143
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:00,973
I'll meet you at the Kahiki Palms Motel
just like we always planned.

144
00:18:01,043 --> 00:18:04,271
- Yeah, okay.
- I'll be there as soon as I can.

145
00:18:04,343 --> 00:18:06,309
All right,
just go now.

146
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:16,532
Poopy!

147
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,701
What do you need a gun for?
Where are we going?

148
00:18:18,777 --> 00:18:21,038
- You ain't going nowhere, bitch.
- Oh, Poopy!

149
00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:22,803
Get outta my fuckin' way!

150
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:26,331
If you're out there listening to this,
I got a message for ya.

151
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,069
I'm coming to get ya.
You can't run forever.

152
00:18:29,143 --> 00:18:32,269
You're gonna have to stop
somewhere, sometime, and when you do

153
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:35,538
I'm gonna be there to put the wrath
of the Lord up your ass.

154
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:37,099
Poopy, don't go!

155
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:39,575
God damn it,
stop calling me Poopy!

156
00:18:39,644 --> 00:18:41,701
- But, Poopy...
- Leave me alone, woman!

157
00:18:41,778 --> 00:18:43,972
- I want my Poopy! Poopy, no!
- Leave me alone!

158
00:18:57,612 --> 00:19:00,373
In an attempt to help the Ruggsville
Police Department,

159
00:19:00,445 --> 00:19:02,411
we here at "News Update"

160
00:19:02,478 --> 00:19:05,105
would like to show you
these mug shots of the suspects

161
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,475
known to have escaped
during the raid earlier this morning.

162
00:19:39,315 --> 00:19:43,408
100. 150.

163
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,243
175.

164
00:19:46,582 --> 00:19:49,878
184 bucks?
What?!

165
00:19:49,949 --> 00:19:51,881
- Candy!
- What?

166
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:55,575
Candy, come on down here!
Come on, cut that out.

167
00:19:55,648 --> 00:19:57,615
Turn it off.
Candy, come down here!

168
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:02,877
- Come on down here!
- All right. Shit.

169
00:20:02,949 --> 00:20:04,915
What?

170
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:07,846
This is bullshit, baby!
What is this?

171
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,747
What do you want me to say?
It's a slow fuckin' night, boss.

172
00:20:11,816 --> 00:20:14,782
All them farmers want is
a quickie hand job and boom!

173
00:20:21,584 --> 00:20:23,516
10 dollar!

174
00:20:23,584 --> 00:20:27,380
Get back on their tractors,
save the real fucking for the sheep.

175
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,541
Jesus, Candy, you gotta figure
a way to hook 'em in.

176
00:20:30,617 --> 00:20:33,583
You gotta hustle
that pussy.

177
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,913
Find a new angle and you might
attract a higher clientele.

178
00:20:36,984 --> 00:20:39,610
Yeah, well, I've been
thinking about that.

179
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:43,675
I was thinking about something spacey
like that "Star Wars" shit.

180
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:47,514
You know, them losers wanna
fuck Princess Leia, right?

181
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:49,552
I'd fuck her.

182
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:51,847
Thank you.

183
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,544
I don't know, you start messing
with that spacey shit,

184
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:56,812
and you'll really bring out
some sick bitches.

185
00:20:56,886 --> 00:20:59,283
They all wanting
to pretend they're robots.

186
00:20:59,352 --> 00:21:02,512
Last thing I need is horny robots
running around, tripping over shit.

187
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:04,950
Droids... boss,
they call 'em droids.

188
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:08,008
Whatever.
I still say it's risky.

189
00:21:11,552 --> 00:21:13,815
Wong's Hong Kong Gardens,

190
00:21:13,887 --> 00:21:15,853
this is Mr. Wong speaking.

191
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,182
Cut the shit, Charlie.
It's me, Cutter.

192
00:21:18,254 --> 00:21:21,118
I got a serious meltdown
going on down here

193
00:21:21,187 --> 00:21:24,346
and I need a place to cool out,
so I'm coming down.

194
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,682
Fuck, man, I don't think it's such
a great idea, you coming around here.

195
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,685
I am coming down... now.

196
00:21:30,753 --> 00:21:32,776
- Whoa, ho... hold it!
- Fuck.

197
00:21:32,854 --> 00:21:34,582
Hold it!

198
00:21:34,654 --> 00:21:36,052
Fuck!

199
00:21:57,889 --> 00:21:59,855
Man, I don't see him.

200
00:21:59,922 --> 00:22:01,683
Shit, where the fuck is he?

201
00:22:02,956 --> 00:22:05,514
Jesus! Can we get
over this already?

202
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,181
I mean, I just don't
find it funny anymore.

203
00:22:08,256 --> 00:22:10,518
I don't know,
it's still pretty funny.

204
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,420
- I'd say so.
- I hate to be the one

205
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:16,784
- to tell you I told you so...
- Then don't.

206
00:22:16,856 --> 00:22:20,346
- But ridin' a mechanical bull
is not as easy as it looks.

207
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:23,049
Technically, she had
a pretty good ride...

208
00:22:23,123 --> 00:22:25,282
until tragedy struck.

209
00:22:25,357 --> 00:22:27,380
Hey, the lesson here is

210
00:22:27,457 --> 00:22:31,720
that tube tops are not the proper attire
for bull riding, Glory.

211
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:33,382
I agree with you.

212
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:36,424
You gonna have to put a harness
on them little suckers, honey.

213
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:39,013
Her "tig bitties"
were flappin' around...

214
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,785
My titties don't flap!

215
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:45,120
They looked like two raccoons
in a gunnysack fighting to get out.

216
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:47,248
- Oh, Adam, shut up.
- When her top fell down,

217
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,257
I was gonna pee myself!

218
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:51,020
"I was gonna pee myself!"

219
00:22:51,092 --> 00:22:53,558
You're just jealous
'cause you don't have any titties.

220
00:22:53,626 --> 00:22:56,183
Oh, Gloria, come on,
no reason to get mean.

221
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:58,225
Come on, baby.

222
00:22:58,292 --> 00:22:59,986
You had one titty going this way

223
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,457
and one titty going that way.
It was pretty amazing.

224
00:23:03,526 --> 00:23:06,788
Chances are high you made
a few fans that night.

225
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,519
Oh, shut up, dipshit.

226
00:23:08,593 --> 00:23:10,684
Well, I told Johnny Cash,
and he said...

227
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:13,554
did you know I shook hands
with Johnny Cash once?

228
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:17,059
Roy, how about you go
find me the ice machine?

229
00:23:17,126 --> 00:23:19,058
I need a drink.

230
00:23:19,126 --> 00:23:22,581
I'll get you the ice, but you gotta
promise us an encore tomorrow.

231
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,626
Roy!

232
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,422
You wish, honey.
Don't you wish.

233
00:23:27,494 --> 00:23:29,483
The babes are
going into seclusion.

234
00:23:31,528 --> 00:23:33,687
Man over radio:
The leader of this group who is

235
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:36,921
a local celebrity goes by the name
of Captain Spaulding

236
00:23:36,995 --> 00:23:39,552
along with two other
suspects known as Otis...

237
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:41,617
Aw, shit fuck
shit fuck!

238
00:23:41,695 --> 00:23:43,161
God, calm down.
Get rid of the car.

239
00:23:43,229 --> 00:23:45,092
Don't worry,
I'll get us a room.

240
00:23:45,162 --> 00:23:47,424
- Well, hurry the fuck up!
- Fuck you!

241
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:49,017
Fuck you!

242
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:53,051
Police revealed today
that they believe

243
00:23:53,128 --> 00:23:55,890
most of the victims were drugged,
kidnapped and sexually assaulted.

244
00:23:55,963 --> 00:23:57,826
God damn it! Fuck!

245
00:24:00,196 --> 00:24:03,992
Hey, Roy, I was doing some research
on that thing I was telling you about.

246
00:24:04,063 --> 00:24:05,961
- What thing?
- Rodeo clowning.

247
00:24:09,163 --> 00:24:10,652
Rodeo...

248
00:24:14,296 --> 00:24:16,455
A rodeo clown?
You been smoking dope.

249
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:20,155
Yeah... I mean no,
not right now.

250
00:24:21,196 --> 00:24:23,822
Let me tell you
something.

251
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:27,262
You spend one second in that pen
and that bull'd have his horn

252
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:30,787
up your ass
and sticking out your pecker.

253
00:24:30,865 --> 00:24:32,832
That's exactly what
I thought you'd say.

254
00:24:32,898 --> 00:24:36,888
You know, you can never be supportive
of anything I wanna do.

255
00:24:36,965 --> 00:24:38,761
What do you
want me to say?

256
00:24:38,832 --> 00:24:41,798
That you're dressed for the part
and headed in the right direction?

257
00:24:41,866 --> 00:24:43,832
Well, Adam was saying...

258
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,922
I've always been
good with animals.

259
00:24:45,998 --> 00:24:47,965
I mean, dogs love me.

260
00:24:48,031 --> 00:24:50,429
And isn't a horse
kinda like a big dog?

261
00:24:51,498 --> 00:24:53,896
I don't know.

262
00:24:55,532 --> 00:24:58,692
No, you're not
clown material.

263
00:24:58,765 --> 00:25:02,096
Forget it. I'm gonna walk
on over to the gas station.

264
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:04,928
- You want anything?
- No... yes.

265
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,522
Get me some
of that beef jerky.

266
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,566
Thanks for talking.

267
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,656
I could've been on that pit crew
down in North Carolina.

268
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,299
Yeah.

269
00:25:32,102 --> 00:25:34,567
Baby:
Meow! Meow.

270
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:36,601
Hey, pussycat.

271
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:40,301
Hey, got a light?

272
00:25:41,969 --> 00:25:45,662
No, uh, I don't smoke.

273
00:25:45,735 --> 00:25:49,690
My doctor says I got lungs
like a professional athlete.

274
00:25:49,768 --> 00:25:51,757
Ah, I get it.
You wanna live forever.

275
00:25:51,835 --> 00:25:53,801
Yeah yeah, well...

276
00:25:53,869 --> 00:25:56,835
So what, are you on vacation
all by yourself or something?

277
00:25:56,902 --> 00:26:01,358
Yeah... no. I'm actually out here
with my singing group.

278
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:02,765
I do the lead singing for it.

279
00:26:02,835 --> 00:26:04,631
It's called
"Banjo and Sullivan. "

280
00:26:04,703 --> 00:26:07,602
I used to sing with Johnny Cash.
He shook my hand.

281
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:10,500
I love famous people. They're so much
better than the real thing.

282
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:14,559
Well, yeah,
I suppose they are.

283
00:26:14,637 --> 00:26:17,126
I bet all the girls
wanna fuck you.

284
00:26:19,137 --> 00:26:24,695
- Would you say that again?
- I bet all the girls wanna fuck you.

285
00:26:24,771 --> 00:26:26,737
(both laughing)

286
00:26:30,238 --> 00:26:32,670
Do you kiss your mama
with that mouth?

287
00:26:32,738 --> 00:26:36,170
Trust me, fella, that ain't
the only thing I do with this mouth.

288
00:26:36,238 --> 00:26:38,603
Don't tell me that!
What? Say that again.

289
00:26:38,672 --> 00:26:41,194
That I ain't the only thing
I do with this mouth.

290
00:26:41,272 --> 00:26:43,238
It's so depressing.

291
00:26:43,305 --> 00:26:46,703
Let's talk about some of the symbols
of these groups

292
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,670
like the inverted cross
or the pentagram

293
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:51,671
or the number 666
left at the scene of the crime.

294
00:26:51,739 --> 00:26:53,136
What do you
think about that?

295
00:27:01,305 --> 00:27:03,965
This is not
an isolated incident.

296
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,937
Well, members of these cults
realize they have no chance

297
00:27:07,006 --> 00:27:08,996
of attacking God directly.

298
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:13,563
- So the next best thing...
- Adam, could you switch this?

299
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,040
- I can't stand to hear about this.
- What do I look like, Roy?

300
00:27:18,108 --> 00:27:20,471
I'm Sullivan,

301
00:27:20,541 --> 00:27:22,871
Roy Sullivan.

302
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,907
Well... Roy Sullivan.

303
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:28,135
You gonna take me
back to your room and play with me?

304
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:31,135
My wife's in that room.

305
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:32,969
Or is my brother
gonna have to shoot

306
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:34,734
your fucking teeth
out of your head?

307
00:27:36,175 --> 00:27:39,073
Okay, let's go, Hoss.
Move it.

308
00:27:39,141 --> 00:27:41,869
Just makes me sick
to my stomach to think

309
00:27:41,942 --> 00:27:45,067
that we live in a world
where there are Satanic cults.

310
00:27:45,142 --> 00:27:47,233
Come on, Gloria,
it's a bunch of crap.

311
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:49,774
- I don't know.
- Look at these two idiots.

312
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:53,206
They're just exaggerating all this shit
to try and kick up ratings.

313
00:27:53,276 --> 00:27:56,333
They wanna get people scared
so they stay at home,

314
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:58,806
buy TV dinners.
Fuck me running.

315
00:27:58,876 --> 00:28:02,331
I don't know about that.
That business down in Ruggsville...

316
00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:04,931
Ruggsville?
Ruggsville can kiss my ass.

317
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:07,339
Ain't nothing but a bunch
of local cousinfuckers

318
00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:09,341
corn-holing the livestock.

319
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:12,807
Could you just switch it
for me anyway, please?

320
00:28:12,877 --> 00:28:16,311
Jesus Christ, I don't know
how Roy puts up with your shit.

321
00:28:17,578 --> 00:28:19,544
What is taking Roy
so long, anyway?

322
00:28:22,612 --> 00:28:25,772
- Hey!
- On the bed now!

323
00:28:25,844 --> 00:28:28,538
- Get on the bed!
- Let me check my... all right.

324
00:28:28,612 --> 00:28:30,839
- Easy!
- What's going on here, Roy?

325
00:28:30,911 --> 00:28:32,900
Shut up! Did I tell you
to fucking speak?

326
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:35,604
- Hey! Hey! Quiet! Quiet!
- Did I tell you you could talk?

327
00:28:35,678 --> 00:28:38,337
Roy, what the hell is this?

328
00:28:38,411 --> 00:28:41,002
- God damn it, look at that jacket.
- What?

329
00:28:41,078 --> 00:28:42,908
On TV.

330
00:28:44,445 --> 00:28:47,844
- Well, fuck the TV.
- Fuck the TV? Fuck you!

331
00:28:47,913 --> 00:28:50,242
Will you keep your head
on the business at hand?

332
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:54,168
- Who's in the shower?
- That's my wife!

333
00:28:54,246 --> 00:28:56,235
- God damn it!
- Don't fuck with. 22.

334
00:28:56,312 --> 00:28:59,745
What are you gonna do, man?
What the fuck are you gonna do?

335
00:28:59,813 --> 00:29:01,836
I wanna know what the fuck
are you gonna do?

336
00:29:04,913 --> 00:29:06,879
Wendy!

337
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:09,344
Get the fuck out of here!

338
00:29:13,647 --> 00:29:15,613
Don't hurt her, please.

339
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,976
Is this everyone?

340
00:29:21,715 --> 00:29:24,374
Hey, Roy. Open up.

341
00:29:24,448 --> 00:29:27,074
I got some of that Dr. Corndog's
hickory-smoked jerky.

342
00:29:28,915 --> 00:29:30,403
Who the fuck is that?

343
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:33,606
That's Jimmy.
He's our roadie.

344
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:35,806
I forgot all about him.

345
00:29:35,882 --> 00:29:37,404
Baby, you all right?

346
00:29:40,048 --> 00:29:42,605
Now I know
I can't trust you!

347
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:44,409
I'll get him.

348
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:48,175
- Hey.
- I'm sorry. I got the wrong room.

349
00:29:48,249 --> 00:29:50,181
I'm looking for
room number two.

350
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:52,738
No, you got the right room.
Come on in.

351
00:29:52,816 --> 00:29:56,680
- Is Roy in there?
- Roy's in here, all right. Come on in.

352
00:29:57,916 --> 00:30:00,508
Get your ass in here!
On your knees!

353
00:30:00,582 --> 00:30:02,071
Roy, help...

354
00:30:12,351 --> 00:30:13,510
Shut up!

355
00:30:13,584 --> 00:30:16,277
We're at the scene
of a horrific multiple murder.

356
00:30:16,351 --> 00:30:19,408
- No telling how many...
- God damn it!

357
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,279
Fuck!

358
00:30:21,351 --> 00:30:23,614
...in the process
of recovering the corpses

359
00:30:23,685 --> 00:30:26,014
which are in varying states
of decomposition.

360
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:29,449
It's currently being treated
as a sign of a mass homicide.

361
00:30:29,518 --> 00:30:32,313
- If initial figures prove...
- (radio shuts off)

362
00:30:32,385 --> 00:30:35,283
Come on, honey.
Mommy has to get to work.

363
00:30:35,352 --> 00:30:38,580
If I'm late one more time,
Mr. McDonnell is gonna can my ass.

364
00:30:38,652 --> 00:30:41,618
I am hurrying!
I dropped something.

365
00:30:41,685 --> 00:30:43,116
Will you get in the car?!

366
00:30:46,385 --> 00:30:49,010
Okay, come on, let's go get in.

367
00:30:49,085 --> 00:30:51,745
- Mom, a clown.
- Yeah yeah, a clown.

368
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:53,375
Oh... hi.

369
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:56,908
Hi. I'm gonna have to
be taking your car today.

370
00:30:56,987 --> 00:30:59,077
See, I have some
top-secret clown business

371
00:30:59,152 --> 00:31:02,415
that supersedes any plans that you
might have for this here vehicle.

372
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:06,011
What's that about clown business?

373
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,345
Do I stutter, bitch?

374
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,352
Jamie, get in the car.
Lock the door.

375
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,818
Where the hell you going?
Damn it.

376
00:31:17,888 --> 00:31:20,150
Don't you never turn your back
on a fucking clown

377
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,119
- when he's talking to you!
- Get your fucking hands off of me!

378
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,086
What's the matter, kid?
Don't you like clowns?

379
00:31:35,421 --> 00:31:38,876
Why? Don't we
make you laugh?

380
00:31:38,955 --> 00:31:42,819
Aren't we fucking funny?
You best come up with an answer

381
00:31:42,889 --> 00:31:46,287
'cause I'm gonna come back here
and check on you and your mama.

382
00:31:46,356 --> 00:31:49,151
If you ain't got a reason
why you hate clowns,

383
00:31:49,222 --> 00:31:52,154
I'm gonna kill your
whole fucking family.

384
00:31:52,222 --> 00:31:54,847
All right, now get
your fucking ass out the car!

385
00:31:54,922 --> 00:31:56,717
Go on!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah!

386
00:31:56,788 --> 00:32:00,518
Shit! Woo!

387
00:32:08,191 --> 00:32:13,317
Chinese, Japanese,
dirty knees, look at these.

388
00:32:15,657 --> 00:32:20,817
Chinese, Japanese,
dirty knees, look at these.

389
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:24,722
Chinese, Japanese,

390
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:28,018
dirty knees, look at these.

391
00:32:33,325 --> 00:32:36,689
Hoss, are you staring
at my sister thinking bad thoughts?

392
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:38,883
No.

393
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:40,322
Why not? You a faggot?

394
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,085
No.

395
00:32:42,158 --> 00:32:45,318
Well, what are you?
I mean, you got this hot piece of ass

396
00:32:45,392 --> 00:32:47,324
shaking her shit right
in front of you

397
00:32:47,392 --> 00:32:50,415
and you're not getting any ideas?
What do you call that?

398
00:32:50,492 --> 00:32:52,082
I'm a married man.

399
00:32:52,158 --> 00:32:54,682
A married fucking man.

400
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,521
Hey, that's just great!

401
00:32:56,593 --> 00:32:59,559
Let's give him a big round
of applause, folks, for the married man!

402
00:32:59,627 --> 00:33:01,616
Come on!

403
00:33:01,693 --> 00:33:03,784
Woo! Married man!

404
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,827
All right. Wow.

405
00:33:05,895 --> 00:33:08,258
Okay, Mama,
front and center, on your feet.

406
00:33:08,327 --> 00:33:10,259
Don't hurt her.

407
00:33:10,327 --> 00:33:13,157
Get on your feet.
Come on.

408
00:33:13,227 --> 00:33:14,887
Let's go.

409
00:33:14,961 --> 00:33:16,620
Please, mister,
this is insane.

410
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:19,251
Boy... the next word
that comes outta your mouth

411
00:33:19,327 --> 00:33:21,816
better be some brilliant
fucking Mark Twain shit,

412
00:33:21,895 --> 00:33:24,793
'cause it's definitely getting
chiseled on your tombstone.

413
00:33:28,327 --> 00:33:30,259
Okay, come on, Mama.
Take that shit off,

414
00:33:30,327 --> 00:33:33,691
let's see what's been holding Hoss's
balls at attention all these years.

415
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,556
What?

416
00:33:35,628 --> 00:33:37,959
What? Take off your clothes,

417
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:40,120
or one of these assholes
is going to die.

418
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,028
Come on, come on.

419
00:33:55,097 --> 00:33:57,222
Shit, way to go, Roy!
She ain't too bad.

420
00:33:57,297 --> 00:33:59,854
She got a tight
little ass on her!

421
00:34:02,897 --> 00:34:04,795
And she got some
child-rearing hips.

422
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,360
Huh, yeah, hey.

423
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:11,760
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me.

424
00:34:11,831 --> 00:34:15,320
Here, ooh, Jeez.
Roy, beginning to see what you mean.

425
00:34:15,398 --> 00:34:17,330
Whoa.

426
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:19,193
Please don't hurt me.

427
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:29,564
You like this, don't ya?

428
00:34:30,598 --> 00:34:33,496
Say "Yes, I do. "

429
00:34:33,565 --> 00:34:36,190
You like that, don't ya?
Say "Yes, I do. "

430
00:34:36,265 --> 00:34:38,231
Yes, I do.

431
00:34:45,432 --> 00:34:46,864
Yes, I do.

432
00:34:46,932 --> 00:34:50,161
Yes, I... I do.

433
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:57,533
Okay.

434
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:00,726
Okay, now.

435
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,061
Give me some sugar.
Make it sweet.

436
00:35:03,133 --> 00:35:05,895
Don't want me to tense
up my trigger finger.

437
00:35:05,967 --> 00:35:08,091
- My finger's getting tense...

438
00:35:26,301 --> 00:35:29,358
I want you to say,
"You're the almighty devil,

439
00:35:29,434 --> 00:35:31,730
and I want you to make me
my filthy whore. "

440
00:35:31,801 --> 00:35:35,199
Come on, say it.
I know it.

441
00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:37,962
I know you're
feeling it. Say it.

442
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:40,058
You're... the...
almighty... devil

443
00:35:40,135 --> 00:35:44,625
and I want you...
to make me your... fucking whore.

444
00:36:06,637 --> 00:36:09,399
You make me sick.

445
00:36:09,471 --> 00:36:11,698
Woo-hoo!

446
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,498
I feel like we're all really getting
to know each other now.

447
00:36:14,571 --> 00:36:18,504
All right, ladies.
Me and the boys have an errand to run.

448
00:36:20,171 --> 00:36:21,637
We'll be back
in a little while.

449
00:36:21,704 --> 00:36:23,227
Come on, Hoss,
move it.

450
00:36:23,305 --> 00:36:25,669
Come on, shit stain!
Gotta go!

451
00:36:25,738 --> 00:36:27,704
Come on!
God damn it!

452
00:36:29,804 --> 00:36:33,202
Authorities struggle to
comprehend the grizzly remains found

453
00:36:33,272 --> 00:36:36,829
in what is now being called the most
heinous crime in American history.

454
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:39,064
The group responsible
for these murders

455
00:36:39,138 --> 00:36:42,572
is now being referred to as "The Devil's
Rejects" by the local media.

456
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,162
A woman known only
as "Mother Firefly"

457
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:47,171
was taken into
police custody today

458
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:49,762
after a violent
gun battle with police

459
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,830
that left four officers
dead and seven wounded.

460
00:36:52,907 --> 00:36:54,703
I'm Derek Sanderson

461
00:36:54,774 --> 00:36:56,763
bringing the world
to your doorstep.

462
00:37:09,807 --> 00:37:11,295
Open the gate.

463
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,331
Ma'am...

464
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:18,430
my name is Sheriff
John Quincey Wydell.

465
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,629
Let's see
who we got here.

466
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:25,435
Miss Gloria Teasdale,

467
00:37:25,508 --> 00:37:27,303
alias Eve Wilson,

468
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:29,364
alias Southern Betty Woods...

469
00:37:31,009 --> 00:37:33,770
Betsy Woods.

470
00:37:33,842 --> 00:37:35,865
And of course,

471
00:37:35,942 --> 00:37:37,932
alias Mother Firefly.

472
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:40,305
You can read.

473
00:37:40,376 --> 00:37:42,433
Congratulations.

474
00:37:42,509 --> 00:37:44,771
Four counts,
grand theft auto.

475
00:37:44,843 --> 00:37:46,809
Five counts,
armed robbery.

476
00:37:48,509 --> 00:37:52,135
What's this?
Looks like your specialty...

477
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:56,303
17 counts, solicitation
and prostitution.

478
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,040
You've been one busy whore.

479
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:03,906
I bet them old farmboys love you.

480
00:38:03,977 --> 00:38:06,341
Everyone loves me.

481
00:38:07,378 --> 00:38:09,435
Don't you pretend...

482
00:38:10,543 --> 00:38:12,566
you don't fancy me.

483
00:38:12,644 --> 00:38:14,543
Oh, yes, ma'am.

484
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,509
I find you quite irresistible.

485
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,633
- Dobson.
- Yes, sir.

486
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,870
- Put them books over there.
- Got it.

487
00:38:25,977 --> 00:38:29,433
Ma'am, you recognize
these books, here?

488
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:32,445
Yeah.

489
00:38:32,512 --> 00:38:36,605
Oh! Ain't she an angel?

490
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,112
Well, she gonna be one dead angel
when I catch up to her...

491
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:43,441
you, your whole clan,
you dead already.

492
00:38:43,513 --> 00:38:46,842
You're just ghosts,
just waiting to expire.

493
00:38:46,913 --> 00:38:49,539
The way I figure it,
only choice you got

494
00:38:49,613 --> 00:38:52,408
is to cooperate
and tell me where they are.

495
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,968
That way your little
angel over there

496
00:38:55,046 --> 00:38:57,978
don't have to die like no dog
in the streets when I catch her.

497
00:38:58,046 --> 00:39:02,241
- Are you done trying to scare me?
- No, ma'am.

498
00:39:02,314 --> 00:39:04,405
With God as my witness...

499
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:06,538
I have only just begun.

500
00:39:06,614 --> 00:39:09,239
Oh... Sheriff...

501
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:11,303
can I show you something?

502
00:39:13,514 --> 00:39:15,742
I'll need this book here.

503
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:17,780
I did never...

504
00:39:17,848 --> 00:39:21,610
get around to putting these
in the book proper.

505
00:39:21,681 --> 00:39:23,544
And I thought...

506
00:39:23,614 --> 00:39:25,477
you might enjoy them.

507
00:39:25,547 --> 00:39:27,604
Oh... you know...

508
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:31,805
he was a real sweetie pie.

509
00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:34,314
Tall...

510
00:39:34,383 --> 00:39:36,009
big moustache...

511
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:38,310
bald head...

512
00:39:38,383 --> 00:39:41,111
You know,
I feel contrite

513
00:39:41,183 --> 00:39:43,808
about blowing
his brains out,

514
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:47,906
'cause he seemed
like such a nice man.

515
00:39:47,983 --> 00:39:51,143
I think...

516
00:39:51,217 --> 00:39:55,149
he said... his name
was also Wydell.

517
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:00,714
Was he kin to you?

518
00:40:06,617 --> 00:40:08,583
Listen to me,

519
00:40:08,651 --> 00:40:11,049
you gonna listen to me good.

520
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:13,141
I'm going to kill every
member of your family.

521
00:40:13,218 --> 00:40:16,775
I am gonna hunt them down
like animals and skin 'em alive.

522
00:40:16,851 --> 00:40:20,249
They are gonna feel the pain
and suffering of every last victim.

523
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:24,080
They're gonna crawl on their hands
and knees and beg me for mercy,

524
00:40:24,151 --> 00:40:26,617
but all I'm gonna
have for 'em is pain.

525
00:40:26,684 --> 00:40:28,311
- You're dead!

526
00:40:31,718 --> 00:40:35,583
You go get 'em, Sheriff!

527
00:40:35,653 --> 00:40:38,813
Go get your ghost!
Them ghosts is gonna

528
00:40:38,886 --> 00:40:42,909
crawl right up
in your h-e-e-e-ead!

529
00:40:42,986 --> 00:40:49,078
You found yourself into something
you ain't never getting out of!

530
00:40:51,353 --> 00:40:54,114
We'll get ya!
We'll... get ya!

531
00:40:54,186 --> 00:40:58,312
We'll get ya!
You're dead, Sheriff!

532
00:40:58,387 --> 00:41:01,376
You're dead!
I'll see you

533
00:41:01,453 --> 00:41:05,783
in fucking hell!

534
00:41:42,823 --> 00:41:45,221
Hey, Hoss,
you like this song?

535
00:41:48,024 --> 00:41:52,218
Do you like this song?

536
00:41:54,523 --> 00:41:57,115
I don't know.
Yeah, I guess so.

537
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,156
Oh, really?

538
00:41:59,224 --> 00:42:01,712
- Which way?
- Take a right.

539
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,313
You like that T op 40 shit?

540
00:42:05,391 --> 00:42:07,357
I thought you
were like some kinda

541
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:11,015
true-blue-balls-earnest-kill-'em
country fucker.

542
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:14,022
You're nothing but a city faggot
with a cowboy hat.

543
00:42:15,557 --> 00:42:17,387
Stop here.

544
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:25,025
Okay, get out.

545
00:42:31,892 --> 00:42:33,381
This way.

546
00:42:39,759 --> 00:42:41,726
Follow the yellow brick road.

547
00:42:48,494 --> 00:42:50,392
Otis:
That's right.

548
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,426
Go on.

549
00:43:02,661 --> 00:43:04,627
You know, Hoss,
if I'm not mistaken,

550
00:43:04,694 --> 00:43:07,888
I think I can smell your wife's
pussy-stink on my gun.

551
00:43:08,928 --> 00:43:10,894
Hope it doesn't rust the barrel.

552
00:43:14,827 --> 00:43:16,793
Oh, man.

553
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:20,295
You know, the stress
of the day is really setting in on me.

554
00:43:21,963 --> 00:43:25,622
You guys happen to know how a guy
like me could relieve some tension?

555
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:31,825
Ah, maybe... I think
your wife Wendy, boy,

556
00:43:31,896 --> 00:43:33,885
looks like she could
relieve some tension.

557
00:43:33,963 --> 00:43:36,088
- Mister, where we going?
- Those little titties...

558
00:43:36,163 --> 00:43:37,958
we're going down
the road here.

559
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:40,393
Those little titties,
she's got a tight little ass.

560
00:43:41,696 --> 00:43:43,662
Does she like it
when you puke?

561
00:43:43,729 --> 00:43:45,524
Is that part of your deal?

562
00:43:45,596 --> 00:43:47,085
Where you taking us?

563
00:43:49,362 --> 00:43:51,829
Well, I guess, it wouldn't
do no harm to tell you none.

564
00:43:51,897 --> 00:43:55,761
We're gonna go dig up some guns
I buried out here a couple years ago.

565
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:58,660
- Then what?
- Well, there ain't no "what. "

566
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:00,696
That's the end of the road.

567
00:44:02,463 --> 00:44:03,952
What?

568
00:44:08,197 --> 00:44:11,754
- You're not gonna kill us, are you?
- Killing sounds so permanent.

569
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:14,456
Adam: We did everything
you want, mister, just let us go.

570
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,293
We did what you said.

571
00:44:16,365 --> 00:44:20,694
First of all,
I didn't say anything.

572
00:44:20,765 --> 00:44:22,856
And second of all,
I'm calling the shots!

573
00:44:22,932 --> 00:44:25,024
Consider me fucking
Willy fucking Wonka!

574
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:27,292
This is my fucking chocolate factory!
You got it?!

575
00:44:27,366 --> 00:44:29,059
My factory...

576
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,065
Get him, Roy!

577
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:33,099
Get the gun, Roy!

578
00:45:31,403 --> 00:45:32,733
Roy!

579
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:53,136
Please, mister, stop.
Please.

580
00:45:53,203 --> 00:45:56,135
- Stop.
- Stop?

581
00:45:56,203 --> 00:45:58,760
Bitch, I have just started.

582
00:45:58,836 --> 00:46:01,701
You know, I was gonna take
it easy on you, boy,

583
00:46:01,771 --> 00:46:05,033
but you brought this
down on yourself.

584
00:46:05,104 --> 00:46:08,367
You had to come
all fucking-big-stick- walking-tall

585
00:46:08,438 --> 00:46:11,563
like a big, fucking hero!
You got yourself to blame.

586
00:46:11,638 --> 00:46:14,502
Look at you now, hero!
You're gonna fucking bleed to death.

587
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:16,537
Fuck you!

588
00:46:18,972 --> 00:46:21,131
That's what they all say,
"Fuck you!"

589
00:46:21,205 --> 00:46:24,399
Well, it ain't gonna save ya.
It don't scare me none

590
00:46:24,472 --> 00:46:27,165
and don't make you a hero!

591
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:34,362
Wanna see what happens
to heroes, boy?

592
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,894
You wanna see bad-ass, motherfucker?
I'll show you bad-ass!

593
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,564
Roy!

594
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,401
Roy!

595
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:48,666
Hoss, I want you
to pray to your God.

596
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:51,570
I want you to pray that
He comes and saves you.

597
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,470
I want lightning to come down
and crash upon my fucking head!

598
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:58,472
- I pray... Jesus...
- Louder!

599
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:02,302
Bless the bunnies,
bless the little birds...

600
00:47:02,373 --> 00:47:06,171
- I don't feel anything.
... - bless the springtime morning.

601
00:47:06,242 --> 00:47:09,766
I feel it!

602
00:47:09,842 --> 00:47:13,296
Oh, Great God Almighty,
I repent, I repent!

603
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:16,034
I feel the love
of the God-God-God Almighty!

604
00:47:16,108 --> 00:47:19,336
Oh, the Holy Spirit
is in my body!

605
00:47:28,342 --> 00:47:32,206
I am the devil, and I am here
to do the devil's work.

606
00:47:36,943 --> 00:47:39,569
Roy! Roy!

607
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:48,038
Roy! Roy!

608
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,170
You fucking motherfucker!

609
00:47:58,244 --> 00:48:00,903
You fucking motherfucker!
Son of a bitch!

610
00:48:00,977 --> 00:48:04,069
I've got other
plans for you... hero.

611
00:48:35,313 --> 00:48:37,609
Shut the fuck up!

612
00:48:44,647 --> 00:48:48,204
Can I go to the bathroom, please?
I'm about to piss myself.

613
00:48:51,547 --> 00:48:53,376
Excuse me...

614
00:48:55,113 --> 00:48:57,511
Can she go to
the bathroom? Please?

615
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:01,104
What?! I heard you the first time.
I was just thinking.

616
00:49:01,181 --> 00:49:03,010
What are you
gonna do for me?

617
00:49:03,081 --> 00:49:05,876
- What?
- Go piss yourself for all I care.

618
00:49:05,948 --> 00:49:08,642
If you want special favors, you gotta
give me something in return.

619
00:49:08,715 --> 00:49:10,681
What do you want?

620
00:49:15,516 --> 00:49:17,981
I want you
to hit her in the face.

621
00:49:18,049 --> 00:49:20,948
- What?
- I know you heard me.

622
00:49:25,449 --> 00:49:27,415
Go ahead.

623
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,849
Go on.

624
00:49:32,749 --> 00:49:34,339
Make it hurt,
no love taps.

625
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:36,382
I want to hear it.

626
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:44,275
Harder, she ain't gonna break.

627
00:49:57,218 --> 00:49:59,410
You better make this
next one fucking count!

628
00:50:10,418 --> 00:50:12,680
- Ah!

629
00:50:12,751 --> 00:50:14,910
Good, very nice.

630
00:50:14,985 --> 00:50:16,951
Now you come here.

631
00:50:18,152 --> 00:50:20,119
Right here.
Kneel down.

632
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:27,014
Give me a kiss and say, "Thank you,
Baby, I'm having a great time. "

633
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,914
Thanks, Baby,
I had a really good time.

634
00:50:31,986 --> 00:50:34,452
Now make it fast, bitch!

635
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,077
Don't try anything cute!

636
00:50:44,786 --> 00:50:47,446
Shit!

637
00:50:52,921 --> 00:50:54,444
Now, what do you
want to do?

638
00:51:04,588 --> 00:51:07,019
Damn it, I knew that cunt
would do something stupid.

639
00:51:07,088 --> 00:51:09,748
Shut up!
Open the fucking door!

640
00:51:09,822 --> 00:51:12,788
- Open the goddamn door!
- Okay! Hold it!

641
00:51:19,322 --> 00:51:22,049
Somebody help me!

642
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:25,247
What are you
gonna do, shoot me?

643
00:51:25,323 --> 00:51:27,380
What did I ever
really do to you?

644
00:51:27,456 --> 00:51:31,354
I swear I'll do it.
I'll kill you.

645
00:51:31,423 --> 00:51:33,355
Why would you
want to kill me?

646
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,548
I'm you're only hope,
my brother's fucking crazy.

647
00:51:35,623 --> 00:51:38,316
- Please!
- Wendy, it's all right!

648
00:51:38,389 --> 00:51:40,015
Come on out...

649
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:05,258
Go ahead, shoot me.
Shoot me right in the ass!

650
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:13,681
Stupid cunt!
Ain't no bullets in this thing.

651
00:52:13,758 --> 00:52:15,417
It's all fucking mind power.

652
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:46,687
Somebody, help! Somebody, please!

653
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,523
Help! Help! Help!

654
00:52:51,661 --> 00:52:54,956
Help me! Help me!

655
00:53:02,562 --> 00:53:04,528
Oh, God. Help me!

656
00:53:05,861 --> 00:53:07,850
- Whoa whoa, darling.
- She's crazy!

657
00:53:07,928 --> 00:53:09,360
Daddy, grab that bitch!

658
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:35,655
Hey, Chief,
I think I got something.

659
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:37,662
What?

660
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:39,628
This Captain Spaulding guy,

661
00:53:39,697 --> 00:53:42,493
Captain Spaulding's
a character from "Animal Crackers,"

662
00:53:42,564 --> 00:53:44,496
a Marx Brothers' movie.

663
00:53:44,564 --> 00:53:46,826
I'll be damned.

664
00:53:46,898 --> 00:53:48,625
Think it means anything?

665
00:53:48,698 --> 00:53:50,664
I don't know.

666
00:53:52,764 --> 00:53:56,252
Tell you what, you get that
movie critic over here. What's his name?

667
00:53:56,331 --> 00:53:58,093
- Marty Walker?
- Yeah, that's him.

668
00:53:58,165 --> 00:54:00,687
Tell him to get his ass
over here as soon as he can.

669
00:54:00,764 --> 00:54:04,128
Tell him to bring whatever information
he's got about the Marx Brothers,

670
00:54:04,198 --> 00:54:06,357
particularly characters
Groucho played in his movies.

671
00:54:06,432 --> 00:54:08,398
All right,
I'll get right on it.

672
00:54:09,732 --> 00:54:11,721
This shit's just getting
weirder and weirder.

673
00:54:20,565 --> 00:54:22,531
Shit, Daddy, I didn't
think you were coming.

674
00:54:22,598 --> 00:54:25,030
I'm cool.

675
00:54:26,765 --> 00:54:28,697
Where the fuck is Otis?

676
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:31,493
Not back from
getting the guns yet.

677
00:54:31,565 --> 00:54:33,259
You wanna fuck with me?
Huh, bitch?

678
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:35,322
You ain't got what it takes.

679
00:54:35,399 --> 00:54:38,298
He fucks this up,
I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.

680
00:54:38,367 --> 00:54:41,822
You believe this bitch had the balls
to try and fuck with me?

681
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:47,997
Cox, nice of you to make it.
Enjoying your meal?

682
00:54:48,068 --> 00:54:50,057
What? I gotta eat.

683
00:54:50,134 --> 00:54:53,259
My blood sugar gets off,
I'm not gonna be any good to anybody.

684
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:55,426
Ya ain't no good
to nobody anyhow.

685
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:58,126
Listen here, that movie expert
guy's here. Wanna talk to him?

686
00:54:58,201 --> 00:55:00,099
Want me
to bring him in?

687
00:55:01,435 --> 00:55:03,765
All right, all right,
I'll get him right now.

688
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:06,266
Mr. Walker?
Come on in, please.

689
00:55:06,335 --> 00:55:07,891
Sheriff Wydell,
it's a pleasure.

690
00:55:07,968 --> 00:55:10,595
I rushed right over
as soon as I got your call.

691
00:55:10,669 --> 00:55:12,726
You came to the right man.

692
00:55:12,803 --> 00:55:16,462
I happen to be a self-proclaimed
Marx Brothers expert if I say so myself.

693
00:55:16,536 --> 00:55:19,161
I'm sure your knowledge
of bullshit is limitless.

694
00:55:19,235 --> 00:55:21,928
Why don't we get to the point?
What do you got for me?

695
00:55:22,002 --> 00:55:23,628
I got a fucking
grocery list for you

696
00:55:23,703 --> 00:55:26,692
of all the major Marx Brothers
characters and related characters,

697
00:55:26,769 --> 00:55:30,166
and I made a secondary list of any
and all films having to do with Groucho,

698
00:55:30,235 --> 00:55:32,793
including such gems as
"A Girl in Every Port," and "Skidoo,"

699
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:36,632
where Groucho played the part of God...

700
00:55:36,704 --> 00:55:40,067
directed by Otto Preminger,
who happened to be Jewish,

701
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:43,194
although he played a Nazi commandant
in "Stalag 17" directed by Billy Wilder.

702
00:55:43,271 --> 00:55:45,396
Otto Preminger also
directed "Exodus,"

703
00:55:45,471 --> 00:55:47,460
and it's rumored
that at the premiere

704
00:55:47,538 --> 00:55:50,027
Mort Sahl stood up,
yelled at the screen,

705
00:55:50,105 --> 00:55:53,798
- "Otto! Let my people go!"
- Give me the damn list.

706
00:55:53,871 --> 00:55:57,133
It's ironic, don't ya think?
Nazi, State of Israel?

707
00:55:57,204 --> 00:56:00,693
They're all here,
all the aliases...

708
00:56:00,771 --> 00:56:03,135
"Rufus Firefly,
Otis Driftwood,

709
00:56:03,205 --> 00:56:05,137
Captain Spaulding"...
all of 'em.

710
00:56:05,205 --> 00:56:09,228
Hey, Chief, I'm thinking we ought to
track down this Groucho Marx guy,

711
00:56:09,304 --> 00:56:11,497
ask him a few questions,
maybe he's involved.

712
00:56:11,571 --> 00:56:14,503
Idiot, he died last year.
He died, didn't he?

713
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:16,765
Oh God damn it.
God damn it, see?

714
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:20,067
That right there is one sad,
pathetic state of cinematic affairs.

715
00:56:20,139 --> 00:56:22,002
If you weren't a cop,
I'd wring your neck.

716
00:56:22,073 --> 00:56:24,800
Hey, let's take
that down a notch.

717
00:56:24,872 --> 00:56:26,861
Excuse me!
Excuse me!

718
00:56:26,939 --> 00:56:31,564
This sneering, rotating,
gyrating pelvis son of a bitch,

719
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:33,902
he died three days
before Groucho,

720
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:35,701
stole all
the goddamn headlines.

721
00:56:35,773 --> 00:56:37,568
That goddamn, fucking
Elvis Presley.

722
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,697
What did you say
about The King?

723
00:56:39,773 --> 00:56:41,864
He died three
days before Grouch...

724
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,633
You ever say another derogatory word

725
00:56:44,707 --> 00:56:47,573
about Elvis Aaron Presley
in my presence again,

726
00:56:47,641 --> 00:56:50,039
I will kick
the living shit out of you!

727
00:56:50,108 --> 00:56:53,336
You get this Hollywood-loving
pussy out of my face.

728
00:56:53,408 --> 00:56:55,703
- Elvis is in Hollywood!
- Get the hell outta here!

729
00:56:55,774 --> 00:56:57,400
- His first film...
- Get out!

730
00:56:57,475 --> 00:56:59,997
..."Love Me T ender,"
was based on an Irish folk song!

731
00:57:00,075 --> 00:57:02,041
Fuck Groucho!

732
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:29,967
Ha!

733
00:57:30,043 --> 00:57:32,566
Booga booga booga booga
booga booga booga booga!

734
00:57:32,644 --> 00:57:36,303
Don't you fucking knock?

735
00:57:36,377 --> 00:57:39,172
- Where the fuck you been?
- Did you get everything?

736
00:57:39,243 --> 00:57:41,709
Oh, yeah, I got everything.

737
00:57:43,677 --> 00:57:47,131
You, motherfucker!
Where the fuck have you been?

738
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:50,438
Hey! You got a problem
with my timeframe, son,

739
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:52,500
you best spit
it out right now.

740
00:57:52,578 --> 00:57:55,976
Yeah, I got a problem.
I got a big fucking problem, bozo!

741
00:57:56,045 --> 00:57:59,068
Well, make your move,
laddie, two hits.

742
00:57:59,145 --> 00:58:01,770
I hit you and your dick
hits the fucking dirt.

743
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:04,811
Old man, you ain't
hitting nothing!

744
00:58:10,345 --> 00:58:13,107
Hey, cut the shit, we gotta
get the fuck outta here.

745
00:58:13,179 --> 00:58:16,111
What are we gonna
do with this one?

746
00:58:17,845 --> 00:58:19,936
Leave her for
a maid to clean up.

747
00:58:23,379 --> 00:58:25,346
I got a better idea.

748
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:40,637
We regret to inform you

749
00:58:40,714 --> 00:58:44,545
that the "Banjo and Sullivan Show"
will be canceled tonight.

750
00:58:47,381 --> 00:58:49,279
Fuck.

751
00:58:53,481 --> 00:58:55,447
No, please!

752
00:59:29,084 --> 00:59:31,050
Housekeeping.

753
00:59:34,317 --> 00:59:36,283
Housekeeping!

754
00:59:45,051 --> 00:59:46,482
Ay, Julio.

755
01:01:45,958 --> 01:01:49,685
Jesus Christ.
What a fucking mess.

756
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:54,283
Wydell: 40-ton truck has
a tendency of doing that, Kenny.

757
01:01:54,358 --> 01:01:58,222
Listen, you mind getting one
of your donut brigade to go over there

758
01:01:58,291 --> 01:02:00,450
and scoop up some
of that skull matter?

759
01:02:00,524 --> 01:02:02,581
Put it in a bag
for the meds.

760
01:02:02,658 --> 01:02:04,283
Yeah, you got it.

761
01:02:04,358 --> 01:02:06,290
Is that the lady
who found her?

762
01:02:06,358 --> 01:02:08,483
Yeah, the maid.

763
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,490
That's Maria Gomez.

764
01:02:10,558 --> 01:02:12,492
She say anything?

765
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,492
Yeah, a lot of things.

766
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,492
But I don't
speaka no Spanish.

767
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,389
It's all mumbo jumbo to me.

768
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:21,620
Shit, what am I,
the mayor of Tijuana?

769
01:02:21,693 --> 01:02:24,625
Got one guy,

770
01:02:24,693 --> 01:02:26,659
Clarks, he speaks Spanish,

771
01:02:26,727 --> 01:02:28,659
but he called in sick

772
01:02:28,727 --> 01:02:31,625
from what he calls
"explosive diarrhea. "

773
01:02:31,693 --> 01:02:35,853
You mind sparing me any further details
about your deputy's asshole, Kenny?

774
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,625
Senorita Gomez?

775
01:02:55,761 --> 01:02:59,091
- No.
- What'd I tell ya?

776
01:02:59,161 --> 01:03:01,093
She's useless.

777
01:03:01,161 --> 01:03:03,956
Chief, got a couple
shit-kickers over there,

778
01:03:04,028 --> 01:03:05,721
says they're here
to meet you.

779
01:03:05,794 --> 01:03:07,760
- Recognize those guys?
- Yeah, I know 'em.

780
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:23,052
- What's going on, shitheads?
- Sheriff.

781
01:03:25,697 --> 01:03:29,129
Here's the list of names I need you
to run down for me.

782
01:03:29,197 --> 01:03:31,595
That's a funny-ass name.

783
01:03:31,664 --> 01:03:34,186
Look who's
fucking talking, Rondo.

784
01:03:34,263 --> 01:03:36,422
Just call me
if anything connects.

785
01:03:36,497 --> 01:03:38,463
I'm sure it will.

786
01:03:39,664 --> 01:03:41,823
Shit always floats
our way, don't it?

787
01:03:41,897 --> 01:03:43,658
Chief.

788
01:03:43,731 --> 01:03:47,424
You keep your mouth open wide enough,
maybe you'd catch it all.

789
01:03:47,497 --> 01:03:49,862
Don't fuck this up, assholes.

790
01:03:49,932 --> 01:03:52,397
Have fun scraping all them
brains up off the road.

791
01:03:52,465 --> 01:03:54,693
See ya later, Kenny.

792
01:04:04,264 --> 01:04:08,698
This is bullshit. I trust that fucker
Charlie about as much as I trust you.

793
01:04:08,766 --> 01:04:11,323
Where the hell you get off
talking shit about Charlie?

794
01:04:11,399 --> 01:04:14,854
Hey, I know what I know,
and I know I don't like that nut sack.

795
01:04:14,933 --> 01:04:16,865
Well, unless you got
a better suggestion,

796
01:04:16,933 --> 01:04:19,694
I suggest you keep
your fucking pie hole shut.

797
01:04:19,766 --> 01:04:22,733
That is the only
remotely safe place I know about.

798
01:04:24,001 --> 01:04:26,432
Hey, man,
if anyone's interested,

799
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:29,092
I think I'm gonna be wanting
some ice cream in about 10 miles.

800
01:04:29,167 --> 01:04:31,224
"Hey man, think I'm gonna be wanting

801
01:04:31,301 --> 01:04:32,789
some ice cream in about 10 miles. "

802
01:04:32,867 --> 01:04:34,890
Don't you fucking imitate me!
It's fucking rude!

803
01:04:34,967 --> 01:04:37,660
"I know what I know
and I know I don't like that nut sack. "

804
01:04:37,734 --> 01:04:39,428
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

805
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,966
Two fucking seconds for the kids,
is that gonna kill you?

806
01:04:42,034 --> 01:04:43,966
Yes, it is gonna kill me.

807
01:04:44,034 --> 01:04:46,296
I have calculated the time
and two seconds is

808
01:04:46,368 --> 01:04:49,391
the exact amount of time
that's a hazard to my fucking health!

809
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:52,195
Come on, don't be
such a fucking drag, I'm starving.

810
01:04:52,267 --> 01:04:54,097
Hey, eat this.

811
01:04:54,168 --> 01:04:57,532
What is your fucking problem?
I'm in and out in two seconds.

812
01:04:57,601 --> 01:05:01,193
I think I'm gonna get me
tuttifuckingfruity.

813
01:05:01,268 --> 01:05:03,928
Tuttifuckingfruity,
that sounds good.

814
01:05:04,003 --> 01:05:05,969
Both:
Tuttifuckingfruity!

815
01:05:06,036 --> 01:05:08,831
- Shut up!
- Tuttifuckingfruity!

816
01:05:08,902 --> 01:05:11,698
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Tutti-fucking-fruity!

817
01:05:11,769 --> 01:05:13,735
Tuttifuckingfruity!

818
01:05:13,802 --> 01:05:18,098
There is no fucking ice cream
in your fucking future.

819
01:05:28,037 --> 01:05:30,901
Mm, dee-licious!

820
01:05:33,237 --> 01:05:37,101
I don't know why you have to be
such a grouch. This is really good.

821
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:39,261
Here, have some.

822
01:05:39,337 --> 01:05:40,630
Fuck you.

823
01:05:44,804 --> 01:05:46,623
Tutti fucking fruity!

824
01:06:33,607 --> 01:06:34,937
Hey, piggy...

825
01:06:35,008 --> 01:06:37,304
Yeah, over here, come on.

826
01:06:37,375 --> 01:06:39,806
Come and get it.

827
01:06:39,874 --> 01:06:43,102
Yes, Mr. Wy-fucking-dell.

828
01:06:43,174 --> 01:06:47,231
Piggy, come over here
and get some.

829
01:06:49,308 --> 01:06:51,603
Don't fucking move, clown.

830
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,640
You looking for somebody?

831
01:06:58,309 --> 01:07:00,740
George?

832
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:02,775
What the hell you doing
down here, George?

833
01:07:04,776 --> 01:07:06,935
I live here now.

834
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:10,443
No. You got that
all wrong, George.

835
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:12,839
I mean,
this ain't your home.

836
01:07:12,909 --> 01:07:15,467
I got no choice, Johnny.

837
01:07:16,743 --> 01:07:18,676
This here is my fate.

838
01:07:18,744 --> 01:07:22,437
I cannot rest until
this whole thing is over.

839
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:24,941
And I'm asking you,
brother...

840
01:07:26,777 --> 01:07:28,901
kill 'em, John.
End this shit now.

841
01:07:28,976 --> 01:07:32,306
I'm-I'm walking the line on this,
brother. I'm walking the line.

842
01:07:35,344 --> 01:07:37,367
Well, Mother pin a rose on me.

843
01:07:37,444 --> 01:07:39,239
That is so great.

844
01:07:39,311 --> 01:07:42,471
I want these motherfuckers dead!

845
01:07:42,544 --> 01:07:44,373
Kill 'em!

846
01:07:44,444 --> 01:07:46,273
I'm sorry, George.

847
01:07:54,145 --> 01:07:58,510
- Yeah?
- Hey, I think I found your guy.

848
01:07:58,579 --> 01:08:01,374
Yeah, a friend of mine,
about 10 years ago,

849
01:08:01,445 --> 01:08:03,809
he used to buy hooch
from this guy out here.

850
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:05,004
Mm-hmm.

851
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:10,307
Went by the name
of Wolf J Flywheel.

852
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:13,835
Yeah, but-but his partner
called himself "The Captain. "

853
01:08:13,913 --> 01:08:17,572
Sounds like the fuckers
we're looking for, huh?

854
01:08:17,646 --> 01:08:20,942
Yeah, Wolf J Flywheel.
That name's on the list.

855
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:23,411
Apparently,
now Wolf J

856
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,605
goes by the name
of Charlie Altamont.

857
01:08:28,413 --> 01:08:31,675
All right, good.
You know what to do.

858
01:08:31,747 --> 01:08:35,111
We wouldn't be talking if I didn't.

859
01:08:37,513 --> 01:08:39,242
So is the shit on?

860
01:08:39,315 --> 01:08:41,247
The shit is on.

861
01:08:41,315 --> 01:08:43,076
Fucking A.

862
01:08:50,216 --> 01:08:52,182
Open the door, Deputy.

863
01:08:56,949 --> 01:08:59,541
Take the night off, Freddy.
I'll watch the prisoner.

864
01:09:03,815 --> 01:09:05,747
Well well well,

865
01:09:05,815 --> 01:09:09,373
working late tonight,
aren't we, Sheriff?

866
01:09:10,416 --> 01:09:12,076
What's the matter?

867
01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:16,048
Can't sleep?
Hell running loose in the streets?

868
01:09:16,117 --> 01:09:19,049
Or did ya
just miss Mama?

869
01:09:21,484 --> 01:09:24,916
As a matter of fact,
I was feeling kinda lonely.

870
01:09:27,684 --> 01:09:30,275
I knew you couldn't
stay away.

871
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:32,316
I got that
power over men.

872
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:37,107
Women like me
are a rare breed.

873
01:09:37,183 --> 01:09:38,910
Don't you agree?

874
01:09:38,983 --> 01:09:41,108
Oh, yes, ma'am, I do.

875
01:09:41,183 --> 01:09:43,149
I ain't been broken,
you know.

876
01:09:44,284 --> 01:09:46,251
Men like that.

877
01:09:48,452 --> 01:09:52,908
Ooh, you got me going
this afternoon.

878
01:09:52,986 --> 01:09:55,543
You think you
can break me?

879
01:09:55,619 --> 01:09:58,483
You like it rough?

880
01:10:00,085 --> 01:10:05,950
Oh, honey, you can have it
any way you want.

881
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:07,986
I don't want it rough.

882
01:10:11,252 --> 01:10:13,218
Oh!

883
01:10:14,686 --> 01:10:16,414
I like it hot...

884
01:10:16,487 --> 01:10:18,419
and slow.

885
01:10:18,487 --> 01:10:21,113
Hot...

886
01:10:21,187 --> 01:10:23,482
- and slow.
- Mmm.

887
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:25,485
- Hot... and slow.
- Mmm.

888
01:10:25,553 --> 01:10:28,713
Yeah.

889
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:38,752
- You like that, Mama?
- Oh, yeah.

890
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:40,786
You like that, Mama?

891
01:10:44,588 --> 01:10:46,554
I...

892
01:10:49,189 --> 01:10:51,280
Yeah.

893
01:11:50,625 --> 01:11:52,648
Check this place out.

894
01:11:55,259 --> 01:11:57,521
Whoa.

895
01:11:57,593 --> 01:12:02,184
I know that ain't Cutter walking
towards me with that stupid grin.

896
01:12:02,259 --> 01:12:06,351
'Cause I know I swore
if I ever saw that dumb-cunt-

897
01:12:06,426 --> 01:12:09,517
no-good-piece-of-shit-
motherfucking brother of mine,

898
01:12:09,593 --> 01:12:13,855
he'd soon be a dead piece- of-shit-
no-good-motherfucking brother of mine.

899
01:12:13,926 --> 01:12:16,051
Okay, everybody
in the peanut gallery,

900
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:18,684
Simon says hands up.

901
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:21,124
He said put
your fucking hands up!

902
01:12:21,193 --> 01:12:23,556
What the fuck
is this shit?

903
01:12:25,161 --> 01:12:28,615
You bring us all the way out here
and this prick pulls a gun on us?

904
01:12:28,694 --> 01:12:31,683
- Nice fucking plan, daisy.
- Just do it!

905
01:12:31,761 --> 01:12:35,091
- He's a crazy pigfucking son...
- What'd you call me?!

906
01:12:35,161 --> 01:12:37,525
Well, if you
give me a chance,

907
01:12:37,595 --> 01:12:42,085
I was gonna call you a crazy-pig-
fucking-dumb-ass-pussy piece of shit.

908
01:12:42,162 --> 01:12:44,684
Oh, brother,
you's a dead man.

909
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:58,194
Ain't that the most goddamn
realest water gun you ever did see?

910
01:13:00,729 --> 01:13:03,423
Oh, shit!
That was great, man.

911
01:13:03,497 --> 01:13:07,554
Sorry about that, it's just a little game we
used to always play on folks.

912
01:13:07,629 --> 01:13:09,425
- And it still works!
- Hell, yeah.

913
01:13:09,497 --> 01:13:12,929
- That's a fucking hoot.
- Johnny, this is my daughter, Baby.

914
01:13:12,996 --> 01:13:15,519
- My niece?
- Yes!

915
01:13:15,597 --> 01:13:17,994
You all grown up.
Give me some love!

916
01:13:19,463 --> 01:13:21,292
And you remember
happy boy here.

917
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:24,454
Are you still an asshole?

918
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:28,894
This is Casey,
my most limber lady.

919
01:13:28,963 --> 01:13:30,521
And this is Candy,
my special lady

920
01:13:30,598 --> 01:13:34,395
and my... top-earning gal.

921
01:13:34,465 --> 01:13:36,397
What you looking at?

922
01:13:36,465 --> 01:13:40,192
- I'm looking at you, mama.
- You see something you like?

923
01:13:40,265 --> 01:13:43,425
Maybe. I set my standards low
so I'm never disappointed.

924
01:13:43,499 --> 01:13:46,522
Oh, well,
I don't disappoint.

925
01:13:46,599 --> 01:13:48,565
Ooh...

926
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:51,689
Fuck, let's go inside.

927
01:13:51,766 --> 01:13:53,789
No sense standing
around like...

928
01:13:53,866 --> 01:13:56,832
stonefoot roosters
in a fuck farm!

929
01:13:59,165 --> 01:14:01,495
- Let's celebrate.
- Oh, yeah.

930
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:34,834
You know,
I gotta tell ya,

931
01:14:34,902 --> 01:14:38,891
that is some catch-phrase
you got there.

932
01:14:38,969 --> 01:14:40,265
"Devil's Rejects. "

933
01:14:47,735 --> 01:14:49,928
You got something
to say to me, clown?

934
01:14:50,002 --> 01:14:52,161
Huh?

935
01:14:52,236 --> 01:14:54,225
I bet you scare
lots of folks, don't ya?

936
01:15:03,069 --> 01:15:06,001
Yeah, you're a regular,
fucking killer.

937
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:11,200
You want a piece of this, motherfucker?
You want a piece of this?!

938
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:14,395
Huh? What you got?!
What you got?!

939
01:15:25,203 --> 01:15:28,897
Lord, I am
Your arm of justice.

940
01:15:28,971 --> 01:15:32,096
Lord, I am Your
arm of justice.

941
01:15:32,171 --> 01:15:34,103
Lord...

942
01:15:34,171 --> 01:15:36,932
I am Your arm of justice,

943
01:15:37,004 --> 01:15:38,970
Your righteous sword
of vengeance.

944
01:15:40,838 --> 01:15:43,202
Let my blows be true.

945
01:15:52,072 --> 01:15:55,300
Oh, yeah,
Lord have mercy!

946
01:15:55,372 --> 01:15:57,133
What a morning.

947
01:15:57,205 --> 01:15:58,967
- Clevon!
- Yeah, boss.

948
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:02,472
You know why I come here
to get these chickens?

949
01:16:02,539 --> 01:16:04,095
No, boss.

950
01:16:04,172 --> 01:16:07,138
'Cause my brother makes
the best fried chicken in the world.

951
01:16:07,205 --> 01:16:08,637
Is that right?

952
01:16:08,706 --> 01:16:10,672
Good morning, good morning, sir!
How are you?

953
01:16:10,739 --> 01:16:12,501
How y'all doing?
Good morning.

954
01:16:12,573 --> 01:16:14,732
Good good good.
What ya got for me?

955
01:16:14,807 --> 01:16:17,432
We got these real cute
barred rock chickens here.

956
01:16:17,507 --> 01:16:20,564
- Yeah, I see it.
- Got them nice, long-legged...

957
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,107
- Rhode Island red chickens.
- Rhode Island red!

958
01:16:23,175 --> 01:16:25,107
- Yeah.
- Oh, I like them!

959
01:16:25,175 --> 01:16:27,766
I want a Rhode Island red
for me, all right?

960
01:16:27,841 --> 01:16:30,306
- Two of 'em. Yeah.
- Rhode Island red, two?

961
01:16:32,108 --> 01:16:34,801
Now, y'all ain't planning on fucking
these chickens, are you?

962
01:16:40,808 --> 01:16:43,297
What the fuck are
you getting at?

963
01:16:43,374 --> 01:16:45,342
Do you fuck chickens?

964
01:16:45,409 --> 01:16:50,603
Well, I have thought
about fucking some chickens before.

965
01:16:50,675 --> 01:16:54,164
If you want to have a good time
and you need some pussy,

966
01:16:54,243 --> 01:16:56,141
you can cut
that chicken's head off

967
01:16:56,209 --> 01:16:58,834
and stick your dick
in that ass of that chicken,

968
01:16:58,909 --> 01:17:03,501
and that damn chicken'll go crazy
on your ass and go...

969
01:17:03,575 --> 01:17:07,769
Are you saying that I would cut off
a chicken's head, put my dick in it,

970
01:17:07,842 --> 01:17:11,502
fuck it
and go "Aaahhh"?

971
01:17:11,575 --> 01:17:14,440
You accusing me of fucking
a chicken, motherfucker?

972
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:16,602
No, I ain't call you
a chicken fucker, but...

973
01:17:16,676 --> 01:17:18,869
boy over there looks
sexually frustrated and...

974
01:17:18,943 --> 01:17:20,910
I don't approve
of chicken fucking.

975
01:17:20,978 --> 01:17:23,773
- You hear what he called me, boss?
- My mistake.

976
01:17:23,844 --> 01:17:25,470
He called me
a fucking chicken fucker!

977
01:17:25,545 --> 01:17:28,340
Go back and grab
the fucking chickens, Clevon.

978
01:17:30,744 --> 01:17:33,267
- Here's five.
- Appreciate it, thank y'all.

979
01:17:33,345 --> 01:17:34,743
He's a chicken fucker!

980
01:17:34,811 --> 01:17:36,744
That's all right,
put it back there.

981
01:17:36,811 --> 01:17:38,675
Next time, we go
someplace else.

982
01:17:38,745 --> 01:17:41,006
We ain't never buying
chickens from him again, boss!

983
01:17:41,078 --> 01:17:43,203
I know, I know.

984
01:17:43,278 --> 01:17:45,244
You inbred! Inbred!

985
01:17:55,945 --> 01:17:58,275
Wolf J Flywheel?

986
01:17:59,613 --> 01:18:02,636
Get your motherfucking
pimp ass over here now.

987
01:18:05,212 --> 01:18:08,076
Who are you talking about, man?
Who you talking to?

988
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:14,542
What's going on, Sheriff?
What'd we do?

989
01:18:14,613 --> 01:18:16,580
What's going on, baby?

990
01:18:18,847 --> 01:18:20,746
You and me,
we're gonna have a little powwow

991
01:18:20,815 --> 01:18:22,440
about a certain Captain Spaulding

992
01:18:22,515 --> 01:18:25,141
and his merry band
of assholes.

993
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:30,145
- Captain who?
- You know what I'm talking about,

994
01:18:30,214 --> 01:18:32,181
am I correct?

995
01:18:33,415 --> 01:18:36,711
Hey, Sheriff...
not in the middle of the street.

996
01:18:36,782 --> 01:18:38,975
Ain't no sense
in getting crazy out here.

997
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:44,306
I don't like no motherfuckers
playing dumb with me.

998
01:18:44,381 --> 01:18:47,246
Now, let me tell you
the way it's gonna go down.

999
01:18:47,315 --> 01:18:49,644
You're gonna make sure
all three of them dirtbags

1000
01:18:49,715 --> 01:18:52,681
are present and accounted
for tonight at midnight. You got me?

1001
01:18:52,748 --> 01:18:56,476
You understand me?
Charlie! You got me?

1002
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:06,478
What if I say no?

1003
01:19:06,549 --> 01:19:09,674
Then I ought to shoot your ass
right fucking here and now,

1004
01:19:09,749 --> 01:19:11,612
you and that other
ugly motherfucker.

1005
01:19:11,682 --> 01:19:14,309
And I'm gonna forget this
conversation ever happened.

1006
01:19:14,384 --> 01:19:17,713
Tonight, midnight.

1007
01:19:21,884 --> 01:19:24,612
It's a bad day to fuck
with me, Charlie boy.

1008
01:19:41,719 --> 01:19:45,742
Hey, we got you this far. Shit.

1009
01:19:45,819 --> 01:19:49,444
Without us, you'd still be swimming
around with your head up your ass.

1010
01:19:51,685 --> 01:19:54,912
Hey, Chief, don't sweat it.
Have a beer.

1011
01:19:54,985 --> 01:19:57,679
It's all going to work out
to your satisfaction.

1012
01:19:57,753 --> 01:20:02,082
If I were you, I'd put the beer down
and keep your mind on business

1013
01:20:02,153 --> 01:20:04,745
before business jumps up
and bites you right in the ass.

1014
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:06,786
Don't worry
about me, boss.

1015
01:20:06,853 --> 01:20:09,512
They'll think goddamn King Kong
came down from Skull Island

1016
01:20:09,586 --> 01:20:12,610
and raped them
a new fucking asshole.

1017
01:20:12,687 --> 01:20:16,051
Hey, man, don't give me
none of that cocky-ass-

1018
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:20,610
yard-bird-pumping-iron-I'm-the-baddest-
motherfucker-that-ever-lived horseshit.

1019
01:20:20,687 --> 01:20:23,551
That might work on some Johnny
Redneck bail jumper,

1020
01:20:23,621 --> 01:20:25,416
but that don't
mean shit to me.

1021
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:27,817
Then I suggest
you pick up the bat phone

1022
01:20:27,888 --> 01:20:29,547
and call some
new motherfuckers in.

1023
01:20:29,621 --> 01:20:31,417
Dime a dozen, man.
Fuck you.

1024
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:32,954
- Fuck me?
- Yeah.

1025
01:20:33,022 --> 01:20:34,487
Fuck you, motherfucker!

1026
01:20:34,555 --> 01:20:37,248
Hey, hold it, hold it!
We gotta cool our shit, here!

1027
01:20:39,588 --> 01:20:44,953
Look, you hired the unholy two because
you wanted the best money could buy.

1028
01:20:45,022 --> 01:20:47,453
Now, you got nothing
to worry about.

1029
01:20:47,522 --> 01:20:49,818
We're gonna
get the job done.

1030
01:20:49,889 --> 01:20:53,616
Might talk a lot of shit,
but we will get the job done.

1031
01:20:53,688 --> 01:20:55,517
Here's the deal.

1032
01:20:55,588 --> 01:20:58,214
I don't give a good God damn
what condition they're in.

1033
01:20:58,289 --> 01:21:01,812
I just want 'em alive so I can piss
in their face before they die.

1034
01:21:04,057 --> 01:21:06,488
You are one sick
fucking pirate.

1035
01:21:06,556 --> 01:21:09,115
Hey, Billy Ray,
your mama's on the phone.

1036
01:21:09,191 --> 01:21:11,282
She owes me 14 bucks!
Get down here.

1037
01:21:11,358 --> 01:21:15,188
- Better keep a rope on that asshole.
- Yeah, I know.

1038
01:21:15,258 --> 01:21:17,746
Now look, G,
let me explain something to you.

1039
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:21,950
You've been using a bazooka
to exterminate three little roaches.

1040
01:21:22,024 --> 01:21:24,956
Now when you hunt roaches,
you don't blow up your house.

1041
01:21:25,024 --> 01:21:27,286
You send in an exterminator
so he can...

1042
01:21:27,358 --> 01:21:29,119
he crawls like a roach;

1043
01:21:29,191 --> 01:21:31,748
He thinks like a roach;
He has a little roach mind...

1044
01:21:31,824 --> 01:21:35,223
Hey... you be careful

1045
01:21:35,292 --> 01:21:38,520
or maybe you get
stepped on like a roach.

1046
01:21:58,859 --> 01:22:00,825
I'm gonna tell you
something, brother,

1047
01:22:00,893 --> 01:22:02,620
you have got it made.

1048
01:22:02,692 --> 01:22:06,887
Please, man, don't be
fooled by the glamour.

1049
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,688
I got trouble.
Don't get me started.

1050
01:22:09,761 --> 01:22:11,420
Trouble. What kinda
trouble you got?

1051
01:22:11,494 --> 01:22:14,551
Man, you got hot and cold
running pussy on tap!

1052
01:22:14,628 --> 01:22:17,788
Man, dealing with these
greedy bitches

1053
01:22:17,861 --> 01:22:19,759
ain't all it's cracked up to be.

1054
01:22:27,861 --> 01:22:30,452
Brother, brother...

1055
01:22:33,995 --> 01:22:36,460
Go ahead.
Pick it up, pick it up.

1056
01:22:36,528 --> 01:22:38,824
Take a hit on this.

1057
01:22:38,895 --> 01:22:41,521
Man, I got the best, mmm.

1058
01:22:41,595 --> 01:22:43,561
Take one for me too, man.

1059
01:22:45,662 --> 01:22:48,651
Hey, listen, you got a nose
like a vacuum cleaner.

1060
01:22:48,729 --> 01:22:50,695
Don't do up all my cocaine.

1061
01:22:50,762 --> 01:22:54,387
Brother, would I
do that to you?

1062
01:22:54,462 --> 01:22:56,428
No, you my brother...

1063
01:22:56,495 --> 01:22:58,461
- See?
... and I love you.

1064
01:22:58,529 --> 01:23:00,496
- All right.
- All right, baby.

1065
01:23:03,763 --> 01:23:06,661
But I love my cocaine better.
Fuck you.

1066
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:09,525
Oh, man, that's some
cold shit right there.

1067
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:15,157
Well, any port
in a fucking storm.

1068
01:25:22,704 --> 01:25:24,670
Mmm.

1069
01:25:42,539 --> 01:25:46,903
Charlie, brother,
my brother...

1070
01:25:50,906 --> 01:25:53,395
I've been looking
for you, clown.

1071
01:25:53,474 --> 01:25:55,440
Ooh.

1072
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:10,329
You gonna start the killing,

1073
01:26:10,407 --> 01:26:13,305
you best start it right here.

1074
01:26:13,374 --> 01:26:15,738
Make sure
I'm all the way dead,

1075
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:19,171
or I will come back
and make you my bitch.

1076
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,007
Bitch that, motherfucker.

1077
01:26:23,074 --> 01:26:26,439
Get up, bitch!

1078
01:26:32,608 --> 01:26:35,631
Stop it! Stop it, motherfucker!

1079
01:26:39,575 --> 01:26:42,133
- Oh! Fuck! Oh!
- Get these scumbags in that truck.

1080
01:26:45,508 --> 01:26:47,771
It wasn't personal, brother.

1081
01:26:47,843 --> 01:26:49,968
Business is business, baby!

1082
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:53,233
You asshole!

1083
01:26:53,309 --> 01:26:56,003
She's right, Charlie.
You are an asshole.

1084
01:26:56,077 --> 01:26:59,703
Why don't you get on
your fucking horse and ride?

1085
01:26:59,777 --> 01:27:03,175
All right, let's get
this freak show on the road.

1086
01:27:03,244 --> 01:27:06,176
What the fuck are you doing there?
Get the fuck up!

1087
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,571
You know, I got
to thank you all...

1088
01:27:59,946 --> 01:28:03,505
for helping me to understand
what my heritage is.

1089
01:28:03,581 --> 01:28:07,104
You see, the Wydells,
they've always been vigilante justice.

1090
01:28:07,181 --> 01:28:12,239
Now, my granddaddy,
he rode with the likes of Tom Horn,

1091
01:28:12,314 --> 01:28:14,371
killing scum like
you for a living.

1092
01:28:15,614 --> 01:28:17,239
We've always
been devil slayers.

1093
01:28:17,314 --> 01:28:19,041
Wake up!

1094
01:28:19,114 --> 01:28:23,604
See I tried to walk the line,

1095
01:28:23,681 --> 01:28:25,510
but now I realize
there is no line.

1096
01:28:25,581 --> 01:28:31,037
We here, we are playing
on a level that most will never see.

1097
01:28:31,114 --> 01:28:34,512
I know my brother George,
he didn't see it.

1098
01:28:34,581 --> 01:28:36,548
Maybe he had a divine moment

1099
01:28:36,615 --> 01:28:38,843
when his brains
hit the floor.

1100
01:28:38,916 --> 01:28:41,906
Yeah, well, maybe you will too.

1101
01:28:44,583 --> 01:28:47,515
I got over here
some photographs

1102
01:28:47,583 --> 01:28:51,310
of every missing person
within 100 miles of this shithole.

1103
01:28:51,383 --> 01:28:54,679
Valerie Green.

1104
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:57,080
Take a look at that.
She was beautiful, huh?

1105
01:28:57,150 --> 01:28:59,513
Hell, anybody'd fuck her.

1106
01:29:01,716 --> 01:29:03,944
This is what she looked like
when we pulled her out

1107
01:29:04,017 --> 01:29:05,846
of your little
fucking torture shack.

1108
01:29:05,917 --> 01:29:08,146
She ain't so fuckable
anymore, huh?

1109
01:29:08,218 --> 01:29:09,843
Oh, yes, she is.

1110
01:29:09,918 --> 01:29:13,282
I cut her tongue out
and tied her to my bed for a month.

1111
01:29:13,351 --> 01:29:16,078
Busted that bitch wide open.

1112
01:29:16,151 --> 01:29:19,140
Well, then you get
to have this as a souvenir.

1113
01:29:30,984 --> 01:29:33,814
What about
Mary Knowles, anybody?

1114
01:29:33,884 --> 01:29:36,180
That fucking bitch is mine.

1115
01:29:36,251 --> 01:29:40,310
No no, she was mine.
I did her, come on. Bring it onto me.

1116
01:29:40,387 --> 01:29:42,750
- Nah, she's all mine.
- Baby, shut the fuck up!

1117
01:29:42,820 --> 01:29:46,344
Baby, you want her,
you got her.

1118
01:29:50,454 --> 01:29:52,545
Fuck, fuck!

1119
01:29:53,587 --> 01:29:56,109
Come and get me,
motherfucker!

1120
01:29:59,886 --> 01:30:01,648
Motherfucker!

1121
01:30:15,621 --> 01:30:17,984
You see this picture?

1122
01:30:18,054 --> 01:30:20,020
That's my brother George.

1123
01:30:21,988 --> 01:30:24,818
Old George,
he was a good man.

1124
01:30:25,855 --> 01:30:27,821
Very trusting.

1125
01:30:28,955 --> 01:30:30,921
I'm sure that's
what got him killed.

1126
01:30:32,154 --> 01:30:34,246
Anyway, y'all take
a good look at that.

1127
01:30:36,355 --> 01:30:38,913
Because that's the reason
you gonna die tonight.

1128
01:30:38,989 --> 01:30:42,682
Yeah, I remember.

1129
01:30:44,590 --> 01:30:46,453
Stupid fuck just like you.

1130
01:30:46,523 --> 01:30:48,455
Come at me like

1131
01:30:48,523 --> 01:30:52,047
some kinda matinee
fucking cowboy idol.

1132
01:30:54,657 --> 01:30:58,919
All I had to do was point him
in a direction and there he goes,

1133
01:30:58,990 --> 01:31:02,150
Officer Wyfucking-Dell
to the rescue.

1134
01:31:07,990 --> 01:31:10,047
Daddy!

1135
01:31:12,857 --> 01:31:14,289
And I hate fucking clowns.

1136
01:31:17,658 --> 01:31:21,488
Yeah, you couldn't
do all this by yourself!

1137
01:31:28,525 --> 01:31:31,515
I slayed me a devil
just the other day.

1138
01:31:31,592 --> 01:31:33,820
What you think? Huh?

1139
01:31:33,892 --> 01:31:36,017
See any you like?

1140
01:31:36,093 --> 01:31:38,650
You liar.
Those photos ain't real.

1141
01:31:38,725 --> 01:31:41,123
There's no way
you killed Mama.

1142
01:31:41,193 --> 01:31:42,783
No, Baby, they're real.

1143
01:31:42,859 --> 01:31:44,587
Take a look at her right there.

1144
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:48,023
Take a look at her eyes the way
they are like that. She's dead.

1145
01:31:48,093 --> 01:31:50,026
You know what I did?

1146
01:31:50,094 --> 01:31:53,322
I took my knife and I stuck
it in there real good.

1147
01:31:54,494 --> 01:31:56,187
And I kinda twisted it
a little bit.

1148
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:59,317
Kinda like fucked her
with it, you know?

1149
01:31:59,394 --> 01:32:01,019
Let me tell you,
that old whore came

1150
01:32:01,094 --> 01:32:03,458
before I fucking took
her miserable life.

1151
01:32:03,527 --> 01:32:06,459
You motherfucker.
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1152
01:32:06,527 --> 01:32:08,117
You gonna kill me?

1153
01:32:08,194 --> 01:32:09,820
You're gonna
fucking kill me?

1154
01:32:09,893 --> 01:32:13,348
- Get off me, fucker!
- You take a good look at that, bitch.

1155
01:32:13,427 --> 01:32:16,950
Take a good, fucking look.
You were her little angel,

1156
01:32:17,027 --> 01:32:19,050
her little angel.

1157
01:32:19,127 --> 01:32:22,754
That's why I got something
special in mind for you.

1158
01:32:22,829 --> 01:32:24,692
Yeah? Well I can't fucking wait.

1159
01:32:24,762 --> 01:32:28,286
If you want it, here it is.
Come and get it. Come on!

1160
01:32:33,596 --> 01:32:35,687
From delusion, lead me to truth.

1161
01:32:35,763 --> 01:32:37,729
From darkness, lead me to light.

1162
01:32:39,129 --> 01:32:43,687
From death, lead me to eternal life.

1163
01:32:46,996 --> 01:32:49,860
Hallelujah!

1164
01:32:49,930 --> 01:32:51,862
Are you feeling it, brother?

1165
01:33:11,031 --> 01:33:13,020
It's time to end this little charade.

1166
01:33:13,098 --> 01:33:16,894
Look, you're free.

1167
01:33:17,964 --> 01:33:19,589
Run.

1168
01:33:19,664 --> 01:33:21,562
I said fucking run!

1169
01:33:31,732 --> 01:33:33,823
Burn well, motherfuckers.

1170
01:33:51,899 --> 01:33:53,490
Come and get it!

1171
01:33:56,366 --> 01:33:58,025
I can hear you, Baby girl!

1172
01:34:03,067 --> 01:34:06,056
I can hear you!

1173
01:34:06,134 --> 01:34:08,259
I got something here for ya!

1174
01:34:10,267 --> 01:34:11,392
What's that I smell?

1175
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:14,560
It smells like rabbit!

1176
01:34:54,937 --> 01:34:58,596
It's me, Charlie, calm down.

1177
01:34:58,670 --> 01:35:00,499
How could you do this?
You ruined everything!

1178
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:03,401
Calm down, Baby!
This is not the time.

1179
01:35:03,471 --> 01:35:06,494
- Gotta get you outta here.
- Daddy and Otis are in the house...

1180
01:35:06,571 --> 01:35:09,537
I'll get them, but first we gotta
get you someplace safe.

1181
01:35:09,604 --> 01:35:10,797
Now, come on.

1182
01:35:21,638 --> 01:35:25,832
Cutter! Cutter, wake up!
Cutter, wake up!

1183
01:35:25,905 --> 01:35:28,167
Cutter! Wake the fuck up!
Wake the fuck up!

1184
01:35:33,605 --> 01:35:37,061
- Wait in the car and I'll go get them.
- I want to go!

1185
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:39,072
Oh, just get in! Go on.

1186
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,806
Stay put.

1187
01:35:46,507 --> 01:35:47,938
Charlie!

1188
01:36:09,541 --> 01:36:12,234
Run, Baby girl, run.

1189
01:36:12,308 --> 01:36:14,172
Run!

1190
01:36:14,242 --> 01:36:16,834
Run! Run!

1191
01:36:16,908 --> 01:36:18,670
Run run run!

1192
01:36:24,008 --> 01:36:25,941
Lord, I bet that hurts.

1193
01:36:26,008 --> 01:36:28,634
Man, I could hear
that bone shatter from right here.

1194
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:31,670
What the hell we got here?

1195
01:36:31,742 --> 01:36:34,708
Hey, looky here,
I got something for you.

1196
01:36:34,776 --> 01:36:36,969
Uh-huh.

1197
01:36:37,043 --> 01:36:38,804
Oh, yeah, I got
something for ya.

1198
01:36:38,876 --> 01:36:41,342
Hey, get up!

1199
01:36:41,410 --> 01:36:44,002
Come on, I said get up!

1200
01:36:44,077 --> 01:36:46,009
- Fuck you.
- I don't know about you,

1201
01:36:46,077 --> 01:36:49,201
but I sure wish I had
a bullwhip for this occasion,

1202
01:36:49,276 --> 01:36:51,674
but I found this.
I reckon it'll do.

1203
01:36:54,010 --> 01:36:56,498
You like that?
You like the feeling of being helpless?

1204
01:36:56,577 --> 01:37:00,270
At the mercy of someone
who's as sadistic and deranged as you?!

1205
01:37:00,343 --> 01:37:03,434
Not such a fucking party, is it?
Doesn't make it you feel proud?

1206
01:37:03,510 --> 01:37:07,567
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me? Oh, no.

1207
01:37:07,643 --> 01:37:09,939
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

1208
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:55,846
Tiny.

1209
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:03,745
Daddy and Otis are
still in the house. Go get 'em.

1210
01:38:07,748 --> 01:38:10,111
The nails!
The nails!

1211
01:38:24,749 --> 01:38:27,306
Tiny! Tiny!
Come on, man!

1212
01:38:52,650 --> 01:38:54,513
Daddy!

1213
01:38:54,584 --> 01:38:57,142
Baby? Baby!

1214
01:38:57,217 --> 01:38:59,184
You're okay!

1215
01:39:02,517 --> 01:39:04,143
Yes.

1216
01:39:21,119 --> 01:39:22,949
Ow! Oh!

1217
01:39:32,586 --> 01:39:34,609
You sure about this?

1218
01:39:38,019 --> 01:39:39,485
We'll come back
for you.

1219
01:39:40,305 --> 01:40:40,271
