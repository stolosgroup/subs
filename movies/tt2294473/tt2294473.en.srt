OpenSubtitles recommends using PureVPN
From 1.99 USD/Month -> bit.ly/getpvpn

2
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,600
It was all that damn kid.

3
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,086
I've always thought he
had no empathy at all...

4
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,600
but I never imagined this.

5
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,448
I can't believe it.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,049
There must be some mistake.

7
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,085
There's no proof, is there?

8
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,964
I saw him.

9
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,571
He snuck out of the house that night.

10
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,246
But maybe he just went out.

11
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,965
Not just that night.

12
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,246
When Mr Kumagai died, too.

13
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,802
We can't just let this go.

14
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,809
It's just that he doesn't
understand the difference...

15
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,245
between right and wrong.

16
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,486
We can't have raised him right.

17
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,129
Don't punish him.

18
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,601
This has gone way beyond that.

19
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,930
He needs to be put away.

20
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,011
That would be cruel!

21
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,730
The boy's only 14!

22
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,002
< LESSON OF THE EVIL >

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,968
The rumors are true.

24
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,051
The marks in Year 1 Class 3
were very similar, and...

25
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,044
Yes, we know that.

26
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,283
So this term, how do
we stop this group cheating...

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,650
ls "cunning" the English word?

28
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,401
No, it's "cheating".

29
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,090
Oh...

30
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,807
And so?

31
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,091
Probably...

32
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,767
they're using cell phones.

33
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,006
So it's email?

34
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,723
They text without looking,

35
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,770
so from under a desk would be easy.

36
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,400
So I guess we ban cell phones.

37
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,925
We do that...

38
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,442
but we can't do body
searches and desk checks.

39
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,322
And it's not good policy to
openly distrust our students.

40
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,490
So what do we do?

41
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,687
Perhaps our Radio Club staff adviser...

42
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,683
could help us here.

43
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,047
Mr Tsurii?

44
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,410
This way we can shut down...

45
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,570
all the cell-phone cheating.

46
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,007
Excellent!

47
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,840
However...

48
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,203
However what, Mr Hasumi?

49
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,284
We may be in violation of the Radio Law.

50
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,530
You mean we'll be jamming phones?

51
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,480
We can adjust to stop it
going beyond the school grounds.

52
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,120
And limit it to exam times.

53
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,721
No one's likely to find out.

54
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,802
Yeah, but...

55
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,722
breaking the law to stop cheating?

56
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,723
That's all mixed up.

57
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,049
Let's think of another way, then.

58
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,129
That's it for this morning's meeting.

59
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,206
Mr Hasumi?

60
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,726
Go for it.

61
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,329
I will.

62
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,964
I have high hopes.

63
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,407
Right.

64
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,565
Hasumin!

65
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,721
'Morning.

66
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,882
Good morning, Misaki & Ayane

67
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,366
Don't forget me!

68
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,090
Hey! Nice hair, Mayu

69
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,251
Questions so far?

70
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,687
Yes.

71
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,802
Yes, Toru

72
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,124
You always say "good" and "great".

73
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,486
What's the difference?

74
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,530
I'll explain.

75
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,490
Correct is "good", better is "great".

76
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,967
Even better is "excellent".

77
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,249
And there's more.

78
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,405
If it strikes you deep in your soul...

79
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,925
Mr. Watarai! It's your turn!

80
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,320
Magnificent

81
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,847
Is that right?

82
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,605
Excellent!

83
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,523
I'm trying to get into Todai University.

84
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,529
Magnificent

85
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,805
Let's repeat.

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,641
Magnificent

87
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,531
What does it mean?

88
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,647
Mr. Nagoshi! You'll up!

89
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,682
Sir?

90
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,921
Stand up, Please

91
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,086
All right, translate the title of
that comic book into English.

92
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,287
You can do it!

93
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,567
I'm sorry!

94
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,322
OK, it comes from "magnify".

95
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,086
It's an adjective.

96
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:32,085
On tests, remember
it means "beautiful", or "impressive".

97
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,129
Everyone! You've got a picture?

98
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,642
Yes.

99
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,450
OK. Next.

100
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,166
Grand, "majestic".

101
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,290
Related to "magnificat".

102
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,641
Magnificat?

103
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,327
A type of hymn, usually sung at evening.

104
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,963
Magnificent praises something
beyond normal understanding.

105
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,325
Keisuke! You're wasted
on science, you know.

106
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,970
Aw, shuddup.

107
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,527
So how's your class going?
Are you used to Hasumi yet?

108
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,924
He's OK.

109
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,408
Anyway, word's getting around.

110
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,047
About what?

111
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,809
The cheating. You're doing it again, right?

112
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,602
You like raising shit.

113
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,682
What good does it do you?

114
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,771
Yeah. Why do you do it?

115
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,325
No reason.

116
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,330
Just to pass time.

117
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,123
It's a game to mess up
their marking scheme.

118
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,250
I won't get caught.

119
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,930
Yeah, you should be all right.

120
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,206
Sure!

121
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,087
After exams I'm taking off.

122
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,080
Where this time?

123
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,642
I don't know. Wherever I feel like then.

124
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,290
I haven't missed a school day
since 2nd year started.

125
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,923
You always say that!

126
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,002
There's no bullying here.
We're right on top of it.

127
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,921
Well, we've talked to her classmates again.

128
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,124
There's no evidence of bullying.

129
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,240
So Rina's lying?

130
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,488
I'm not saying that.

131
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,680
Maybe there's been some misunderstanding...

132
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,887
Misunderstanding?

133
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,209
You mean she just thinks
she's being bullied when she isn't?!

134
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,970
Do you think the ones doing it
don't know what'll happen...

135
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,804
if they own up to it?!

136
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,365
Calm down, please.

137
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,643
Calm down?!

138
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,730
Did you just tell me to calm down?!

139
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,283
Everything I do is for my daughter.

140
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,160
I'll kick your ass!

141
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,606
Try me!

142
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,730
I can fight, you know!

143
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,805
Inside.

144
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,169
Did you see that?

145
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,845
That was Miya, right?

146
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,046
Psychopathology Research

147
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,803
Hasumin! 'Morning!

148
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,122
Careful!

149
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,407
Who put gum in here!

150
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,440
Just leave it.

151
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,168
Then we can't lock it from inside.
Someone'll break in.

152
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,847
They'll just wreck it again.
Think of another way.

153
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,045
Hasumin...

154
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,001
What's up?

155
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,046
Um...

156
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,841
What's wrong?

157
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,000
Well...

158
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,282
Reika thinks maybe...

159
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,361
Miya is being sexually harassed.

160
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,046
Who by?

161
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,962
Are you OK?!

162
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,245
You're next.

163
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,287
Yes, sir.

164
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,810
Mr Shibahara found out...
I was shoplifting.

165
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:00,601
I won't tell anyone, he said.
Tell me why you did it.

166
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,801
I did...

167
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,082
and he recorded it...

168
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,087
then said put out or else.

169
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,410
Appalling.

170
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,566
Really!

171
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,365
You, too.

172
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,526
Seatbelt.

173
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,487
Send Shibahara this text.

174
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,202
I've apologized to the store, comma...

175
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,204
and it's OK now. Period.

176
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,370
However... Wait...

177
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,209
However, comma...

178
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,569
I found out that for
lewd conduct with a minor, comma...

179
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,247
you are the one...

180
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,651
who will get charged. Period.

181
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,563
Is this OK?

182
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,520
Don't worry. He takes the
fall if this gets out.

183
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,160
Don't! Stop it!

184
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,367
You, too.

185
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,086
You stop it.

186
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,251
I'm going home.

187
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,811
See you tomorrow. Go straight home.

188
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,963
Starting with today's test,
we will collect cell phones.

189
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,690
I sympathize, but this
is a faculty decision.

190
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,966
Let's have 'em.

191
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,886
Thank you.

192
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,650
Give it here.

193
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,841
Thank you.

194
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,765
Thank you.

195
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,489
Where's yours?

196
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,726
I forgot it.

197
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,129
Oh, well...

198
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,811
No service

199
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,569
No service?

200
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,327
Maybe there's something
wrong with your phone.

201
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,528
With everyone's?

202
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,764
Now they're all working fine.

203
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,842
They were being jammed.

204
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,166
Jammed?

205
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,361
An interference signal.

206
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,526
It can be done.

207
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,444
Then why would they bother
confiscating the phones?

208
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,171
Someone else was doing it.

209
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,290
Jamming the phones?

210
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,566
Who?

211
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,764
My home-room teacher, I bet.

212
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,285
Tsurii?

213
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,567
Yeah.

214
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,645
He's staff adviser for the Radio Club.

215
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,609
He's a lurker.

216
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,286
You never know what he's thinking.

217
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,720
Since I have you here, I'll say two things.

218
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,611
One...

219
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,281
I will overlook this
latest cheating incident.

220
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,089
Learn from that.

221
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,524
And the second...

222
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,042
I wasn't jamming the phones.

223
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,570
But someone was.

224
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,804
Unless your phones and mine
went on the blink together...

225
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,129
it looks that way.

226
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,921
So?

227
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,242
Watch your step.

228
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Masanobu Tsurii The
Werther Effect

229
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,811
Copycat Suicides

230
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:05,604
In Norse mythology, a pair of ravens
named Huginn and Muninn...

231
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,326
patrol the world as agents of Odin.

232
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,165
Their names mean thought and memory".

233
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:24,564
These two ravens fly over the Earth...

234
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,564
and bring tidings to
Odin, King of the Gods.

235
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,681
Watch your head. Feet first.

236
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,443
Whoa!

237
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,329
It's OK. Hang on.

238
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,126
Here he comes!

239
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,089
Go.

240
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,445
You OK?

241
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,087
Almost there. Take it slow!

242
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,130
I made it!

243
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,123
Confirm the victim is
conscious and breathing.

244
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,604
Finally, confirm pulse and breathing.

245
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,211
And that's it.

246
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,961
All right?

247
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,484
Who wants to try?

248
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,289
Me!

249
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,802
What if you defibrillate
his crotch by mistake?

250
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,325
Hey, wait!

251
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,450
It's OK! You might even like it.

252
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,160
Do me.

253
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,610
Three, two...

254
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,842
one, barn!

255
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,245
I never came that much before.

256
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,961
Yuck!

257
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,366
Whatever.

258
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,648
But don't forget...

259
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,840
it records everything
you say when it's in use.

260
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,769
Is that true?!

261
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,206
As data to improve treatment in the future.

262
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,122
And you're ugly!

263
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,048
Uh-oh... Cut it out! Slow down!

264
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,645
Tade!

265
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,722
Ow! That hurts!

266
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,201
What a wimp!

267
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,611
Loser!

268
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,046
So you said there was
no bullying in Year 2 Class 4?

269
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,081
You didn't look very hard!

270
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,004
You didn't see that.

271
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:26,129
It's a message board one
of the girls started.

272
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,522
It's password-protected
so not everyone can get on.

273
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,368
There's a whole world out
there you don't see!

274
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,970
See? It's clear there's bullying going on.

275
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,521
This is Saori Yokota's site, Mr Kiyota.

276
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,967
There's lots like that.

277
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,682
I assume you're taking this
comment by "Tade" as bullying?

278
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,450
They're complaining about her!

279
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,567
All of them!

280
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,370
This "Tade"...

281
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,124
is a student named "Tadenuma".

282
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,124
He can be a bit aggressive...

283
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,171
but I wouldn't take
criticism on a site like this...

284
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,490
is anything more than letting off steam.

285
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,006
We all need that, don't we.

286
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,691
What?

287
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,045
I'm just here complaining
so I can let off steam?

288
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,369
Not at all.

289
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,324
You think you're pretty
smart, you son of a bitch!

290
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,127
Hasumin...

291
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,687
Yes, Miya?

292
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,088
Could I see you after school?

293
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,487
What's up?

294
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,170
I can't say here.

295
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,925
What?

296
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,884
Hey! What's going on?

297
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,964
I hate that.

298
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,961
Sorry.

299
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,125
Who's there?

300
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,090
Did you see?

301
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,800
What?

302
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,325
What are you doing?

303
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,530
Just sleeping.

304
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,930
It's wet.

305
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,171
Leave me alone.

306
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,726
It's OK.

307
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,126
Who was it?

308
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,249
Don't worry about it.

309
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,884
Where's Rina?

310
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,089
Hasn't she phoned?!

311
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,165
Kerosene?

312
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,801
Yes.

313
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,368
He had water bottles out
front to keep cats away.

314
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,889
But they'd been filled with kerosene.

315
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:13,130
We think the fire that killed him
started with a butt he'd thrown down.

316
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,845
A cigarette... He smoked
a lot, didn't he.

317
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,323
Oh?

318
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,405
He'd sit there and chain-smoke.

319
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,808
Here?

320
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,124
He'd come about his daughter.

321
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,928
Right?

322
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,687
Yes.

323
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,922
Well, at least Rina wasn't hurt.

324
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,371
That's the one good thing about it.

325
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,364
You're a detective, right?

326
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,727
And you are?

327
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,001
Tsurii. I teach physics here.

328
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,045
Mr Tsurii?

329
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,926
About Mr Hasumi, Rina's
home-room teacher...

330
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,687
He's a good teacher. Very enthusiastic.

331
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,444
And handsome.

332
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,051
What about him?

333
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,922
He started teaching at
this school last year.

334
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:40,360
Before that he was at
Kitahara Municipal High School.

335
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,248
Yes... and?

336
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,291
Kitahara Municipal High School.

337
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,045
- So what?
- Goodbye.

338
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,967
What did you tell the cops?

339
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:21,368
That until the year before last,
Mr Hasumi taught at Kitahara High.

340
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,766
Kitahara High?

341
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,329
Cool!

342
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,045
What do you mean?!

343
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,847
Should I name names, Mr Kume?

344
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,963
All right. Masahiko Maejima.

345
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,648
You are involved with a student in
a homosexual relationship.

346
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,001
And so...

347
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,688
what do you want now?

348
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,009
I don't want this brought to light, either.

349
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,129
It could affect him emotionally.
Masahiko is sensitive.

350
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,362
And a bit conceited.

351
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,401
The combination could drive him to suicide.

352
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,006
He is also very attached to you, Mr Kume.

353
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,050
It's best for him if this is kept secret.

354
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,362
And for you as well.

355
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,568
You'd lose your teaching license.

356
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:50,089
Your family's prominent, too.
I'd like you to take more care.

357
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,447
This doesn't just involve you.

358
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,160
I'm sorry.

359
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,090
But how did you find out?

360
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,924
That doesn't matter.

361
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:08,885
What is important now is that you admit...

362
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,930
that you are an anti-social...

363
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,802
pervert.

364
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,489
Which means...

365
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,764
your life is in my hands.

366
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,321
I'm sure you understand.

367
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,409
Wow!

368
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,209
This is too much!

369
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,601
Tell me...

370
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,802
who's the friend who
lent you this place?

371
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,322
A smart gay, let's say.

372
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,888
Shall we shower?

373
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,610
You'd prefer alone?

374
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,083
I don't know...

375
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,571
What's that?

376
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,729
On your back.

377
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,801
A scar from an accident when I was a kid.

378
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,847
What happened?

379
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,163
Nothing worth talking about.

380
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,009
Werther effect?

381
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,968
The Sorrows of Young Werther,
the book by Goethe.

382
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,726
In the end he shoots himself.

383
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,971
A lot of people committed suicide
after it first came out.

384
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:00,648
So a wave of copycat suicides
is called the "Werther effect".

385
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,450
That happened at Kitahara?

386
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,722
There were four of them.

387
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,243
Two by hanging, one by jumping,
and one by carbon monoxide.

388
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,845
All at the school...

389
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,688
when Hasumi was there.

390
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,206
So?

391
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,202
Beats me.

392
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,044
How would I know?

393
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,210
Tsurii told the police...

394
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:32,521
Hasumi was at Kitahara
when the suicides happened.

395
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,968
He was involved?

396
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,410
No way!

397
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,842
Keisuke...

398
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,680
Drop this.

399
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:52,843
Why?

400
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,241
Just stop.

401
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,524
Somehow I feel...

402
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,529
you're in danger.

403
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,489
What?

404
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,880
Yeah, OK.

405
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,966
You piece of shit!

406
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,766
Stop it!

407
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,523
Don't!

408
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,926
Cut it out!

409
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,685
Where's Hasumin?

410
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,887
What's going on?

411
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,849
Yokota's site.

412
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,128
MT burned down RK's house

413
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,922
Tade burned down Rina's house?!

414
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,765
No, but someone posted this.

415
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,881
Who?!

416
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,566
Miya...

417
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:23,290
how many of those message boards
can you get onto?

418
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,841
Hey!

419
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:27,963
Tade!

420
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,288
Just between us.

421
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,925
Let's have a drink.

422
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,047
Huh?

423
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,329
You're a teacher.

424
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,326
I know you guys all drink.

425
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,566
You get a lot of things that piss you off.

426
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:12,646
We won't go anywhere, where we'll be seen.

427
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,091
I'm broke.

428
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,526
The grown-up pays, of course.

429
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,530
From his low salary. Don't tell anyone.

430
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,360
Let's see your hand.

431
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,603
It's fine.

432
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,363
Show me.

433
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,124
I'm fine.

434
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,123
And the shark, it has teeth

435
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,889
And it wears them in its face

436
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:10,331
And a knife has Mackie Messer

437
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,964
Of the knife one sees no trace

438
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,966
On a beautiful blue Sunday

439
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:27,729
Lies a dead man on the Strand

440
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:33,404
And a man goes round the corner

441
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:38,851
Mackie Messer they call that man

442
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,088
And Schmul Meier is missing

443
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:51,088
And many another rich man

444
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:57,208
And Mackie Messer has their money

445
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:02,764
They can't pin anything on him

446
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:09,160
Jenny Towler was found

447
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:15,123
With a knife in her chest

448
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:21,242
And on the wharf walks Mackie Messer

449
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:27,282
Who knows nothing about all this

450
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,122
And the great fire in Soho

451
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:39,327
Burnt to death were seven
children and an old man

452
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,883
In the crowd is Mackie Messer...

453
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,801
Hello, police? Help!

454
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,800
Who knows nothing, and whom you don't ask

455
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:58,001
And the young widow

456
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:04,202
Whose name everyone knows

457
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:10,686
Woke up with the dirty deed done

458
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:17,200
Mackie, what was your price?

459
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:24,087
Woke up with the dirty deed done

460
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,211
Mackie, what was your price?

461
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,083
It's just too weird.

462
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:31,241
Will you tell me what
you've found out about Mr Hasumi?

463
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,682
All I have is doubts, nothing more.

464
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,442
OK...

465
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,449
when did you first have doubts?

466
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,008
I'm a jerk, right?

467
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,088
Sorry?

468
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,246
When I meet someone outstanding...

469
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:56,607
I soon get feelings of inadequacy
that come bubbling up...

470
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,484
from deep down.

471
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:04,725
But I didn't feel any
of that when I met him.

472
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,611
On the surface...
...he glitters.

473
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,242
But after a month, or even six months...

474
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,290
I still didn't hate myself.

475
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,441
There's something very strange about that.

476
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,162
So I went through
what I could find from his resume...

477
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,805
here at the school.

478
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,006
I found....

479
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,722
it had strange gaps in it.

480
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:48,010
His father was a doctor,
and he was born here in Tokyo.

481
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,480
But then for 3rd year middle school...

482
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,324
he switched to Kyoto.

483
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:00,486
He stayed there, and got into Law
at Kyoto University...

484
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,005
but...

485
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,489
he dropped out after a month.

486
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:13,204
The next September he went abroad...
to Harvard!

487
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:19,722
What he studied had nothing to
do with becoming an English teacher.

488
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,890
He graduated, and took an MBA.

489
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,206
He then went to the North American
head office of Morgenstern.

490
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,642
Morgenstern?

491
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,121
A European investment bank.

492
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,564
But after two years he left...

493
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,730
and came back to Japan.

494
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,608
Then he suddenly changed fields,
and became a teacher.

495
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,290
At Kitahara.

496
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,329
So what's going on?

497
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,844
I started following other
lines of investigation.

498
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:00,443
His father's Clinic in Toshima Ward
had gone out of business.

499
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:05,882
Dr Hasumi and his wife
had been stabbed to death...

500
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,243
by an intruder.

501
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,248
His parents?

502
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,242
Yes.

503
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,086
He was stabbed in the
back and badly wounded.

504
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:19,165
That was in the winter of
2nd year middle school.

505
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:24,607
That made me very interested in

506
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,683
the suicides at Kitahara High.

507
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:30,722
Were they really suicides?

508
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,885
Or had there been other strange deaths
where he was around?

509
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:43,247
Before his parents died,
his middle-school home-room teacher...

510
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:48,531
a man named Kumagai,
had been killed in a car crash.

511
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,808
I only know about Tokyo.

512
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,003
What do you think, Mr Tsurii?

513
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,490
About Tade.

514
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,887
They say he ran away from home.

515
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:10,326
What do you think?

516
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,320
Good evening.

517
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:38,961
Good evening.

518
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,169
May I sit there?

519
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:24,880
Mr Tsurii made the sad choice...

520
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,082
to take his own life.

521
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:31,246
About this there is something
that must be said.

522
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:35,450
Which is that life itself is precious.

523
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:40,811
Here we go again, you may be thinking.

524
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:46,011
Whenever something like this happens,
our ears are numbed...

525
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:51,124
by talk of the importance of life
at school and in the media.

526
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,171
Where is it?!

527
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,369
Excellent!

528
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,805
Was it you?

529
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,321
Well done, Keisuke Hayami.

530
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,122
You're right. I bugged the room.

531
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,130
Did you kill him?

532
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,366
Keisuke?

533
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,651
Keisuke?

534
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,761
Sir?

535
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,811
Sorry.

536
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,762
I didn't want anyone to see.

537
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,520
What's up?

538
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,762
Have you seen Keisuke?

539
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,447
Keisuke?

540
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,929
Keisuke Hayami?

541
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,041
No, I haven't. Why?

542
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,805
Nothing.

543
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,966
Soldering irons are great things, you know.

544
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:44,762
They can seal a wound shut
so you don't get the floor dirty.

545
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:49,920
Visually it's not great, though.

546
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,125
It leaves holes all over
the skin, like a beehive.

547
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,205
It's disgusting.

548
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,489
You know why I have this, right?

549
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:46,770
Nod for "yes", shake your head for "no".

550
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,884
Is that clear Mr. Hayami?

551
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,088
Bad, boy

552
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,686
First question.

553
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,243
The cheating...

554
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,484
which was very cunning...

555
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,805
You ran that.

556
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,165
Right?

557
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,369
Nod for "yes", shake your head for "no".

558
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:41,481
I see.

559
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,529
So you were the ringleader,
and these were your...

560
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,325
accomplices?

561
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:05,010
You may not want to tell on them,
but I won't do anything right away.

562
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,409
So relax.

563
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,164
This is so we can guide
our students better.

564
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,726
It's them, right?

565
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,089
Hey, Mr. Hayami, Yes or No?

566
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,042
Now...

567
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,964
to the big question.

568
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:53,324
Have you told anyone
what you heard from Mr Tsurii?

569
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:32,767
You were superb, Keisuke Hayami.

570
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:38,763
All those holes, and you wouldn't talk.

571
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:42,923
Or maybe you hadn't told anyone.

572
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:49,968
Anyway, as a teacher, I
am proud to have had...

573
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,485
a student like you.

574
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,411
Nice, that's "Mack The Knife".

575
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,881
Nope

576
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:01,241
Moritat.

577
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:07,011
Brecht's, The Threepenny Opera has... music

578
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,650
Yeah, I know.

579
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:16,411
Mack The Knife is the jazz
version of "Moritat".

580
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,526
Lyrics are little different.

581
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:46,367
But it's still a song about
a fucking killer tho.

582
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,526
It's MY theme song.

583
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,324
You've killed a few, haven't you?

584
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,200
I spot people like you a mile away.

585
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,444
I'm right, aren't I?

586
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,362
Let's be partners.

587
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,444
It's over, CLAY.

588
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,282
You like killing for pleasure. Ha?

589
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,331
Not me.

590
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,283
You take the blame...

591
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,528
and a fucking burn.

592
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,606
Mr. Hasumi...

593
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,200
Vincent

594
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,610
has done an unfortunate thing.

595
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,206
As you can see

596
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:15,287
suicide.

597
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:18,123
There's even a will.

598
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,081
It's real.

599
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:26,728
You will testify. Because you get the
honor of being the first witness.

600
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,246
If I refuse?

601
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,081
You can't refuse.

602
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,829
Your name and fingerprints
will be on the

603
01:09:44,842 --> 01:09:47,281
blacklist with the United
State immigration.

604
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:51,683
You'll never be able to
step foot into this country again.

605
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,560
Listen son

606
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:02,202
I plan on retiring quietly. Very quietly.

607
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,004
Don't ever come back.

608
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:09,448
You know...

609
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:13,442
this world is only for ambitious and
money-hungry criminals.

610
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,725
Not psychotic killers...

611
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:08,005
I could kill you anytime, Muninn.

612
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:20,967
You hardly ever answer
your cell phone, do you.

613
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,361
Idon%?

614
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,969
I don't know what you
do when I'm not around.

615
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,606
Does it bother you?

616
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,400
Not really.

617
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:39,566
What is it?

618
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,646
Why...

619
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,406
do you have Tade's cell phone?

620
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,089
We went out drinking.

621
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:03,881
When?

622
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:13,330
The day of the fight.

623
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:22,725
He acts all grown-up, but
he can't hold his liquor.

624
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,961
He forgot his cell phone.

625
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,881
Tell me...

626
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:47,568
who do you think left that message?

627
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:56,441
About Tade putting kerosene
around Rina's house?

628
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,965
What do you think?

629
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,371
I don't know.

630
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:32,489
Final notice: I don't want to
be Shibahara's slave any more.

631
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:36,083
I am unclean in body and soul.

632
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:47,160
The only thing I can do
is leave this body. Miya.

633
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,331
Milk Bar

634
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,850
I want a crepe, but this is Chinese food.

635
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:58,769
Sweet-and-sour pork. That's what I want.

636
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,081
Work hard.

637
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:01,720
Sweet-and-sour.

638
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:05,688
This is the Year 2 Class 4 classroom.

639
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,091
Yay!

640
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:10,921
Hell.

641
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:14,526
Don't film me!

642
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:18,368
Whoa!

643
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,848
What do we have inside?

644
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,886
Hands growing out of the wall.

645
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:30,005
The 2-4 House of Horrors
is under construction.

646
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:33,403
Work is steadily falling behind schedule.

647
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,483
Will they be done in time?

648
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,406
Whoa!

649
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,484
That was a scare.

650
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,607
Ms Kashiwabara, how is work progressing?

651
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:51,291
Uh... There's lots to
do, but we're trying.

652
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:51,980
Yes!

653
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:54,930
Great! I got your "yes!"

654
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:58,721
Hisashi! Put that thing down and help!

655
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,406
This is the "making of' video!

656
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,803
For future generations
when the festival's over.

657
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,007
For what?

658
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,123
Yuck! That's disgusting!

659
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,884
Something's going on!

660
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,247
Let me see.

661
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,281
What do you think?

662
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,242
Rina?!

663
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,046
Rina!

664
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,851
Has Rina Kiyota returned?

665
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:25,884
You'll be here next term?

666
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:26,768
Yes.

667
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,410
Great!

668
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,444
Are you staying all night tonight?

669
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,487
Yes.

670
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,010
A comment, please.

671
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:38,050
Uh... no comment.

672
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,368
Hasumin! Rina's back.

673
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,291
I'm fine now.

674
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:56,082
You know what our class is making?

675
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:56,968
What?

676
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:57,962
Look.

677
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,488
A house of horrors!

678
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:03,202
She's lonely.

679
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,328
Yeah, you're right.

680
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:07,680
Settle down!

681
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,844
Who's here from Class 4?

682
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,687
Everyone, I think.

683
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,965
Except Tade.

684
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:19,451
Don't start trouble.

685
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,690
Is Shibahara...

686
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,244
still hitting on Miya?

687
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,243
I don't know.

688
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,723
He's the duty teacher.

689
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:35,731
He'll be here with us all night.

690
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,727
You think he'll try something again?

691
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:39,807
There she is.

692
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:44,765
He told her...

693
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,364
to come see him?!

694
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,326
Come on!

695
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:51,725
I'll stay here.

696
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,328
You're not worried?

697
01:17:58,840 --> 01:17:59,682
Hasumin?

698
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,321
Lock it.

699
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:14,522
Can we send Yuzuka that picture from
Tade's cell phone?

700
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:17,162
The one of them both.

701
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,488
When Rina showed up...

702
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:26,002
she said,
With Tade the whole class would be here...

703
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,925
and got all teary-eyed.

704
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:32,448
I don't think we should
show that to Yuzuka.

705
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,246
It might make things harder?

706
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,122
What's that?

707
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:10,245
What... are...

708
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,722
Giving Mr Shibahara a gift.

709
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,280
Hasu....

710
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:29,921
min...

711
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,044
It's OK.

712
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:59,125
Whoa! Don't do that!

713
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:01,682
Hasumin?

714
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:04,481
Where's Miya?

715
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:07,566
Miya?

716
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:12,647
Miya?

717
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:14,561
Miya?

718
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,565
Kume speaking.

719
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:01,006
It's Hasumi. Where are you?

720
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:02,721
At home.

721
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,121
You can be here in 30 minutes.

722
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,162
Hurry.

723
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:10,050
There's trouble. It's Masahiko.

724
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,010
Masahiko

725
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:24,002
We're sorry, but your call
cannot be completed...

726
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:25,521
Here.

727
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:30,446
Thanks.

728
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:36,811
No service?

729
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:49,562
Satomi?

730
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:51,851
Do you have a minute?

731
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,325
I'd like to talk to you.

732
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,131
Talk to me?

733
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,323
Sure. What about?

734
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:01,241
Could we...

735
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:04,361
talk in the Club Room?

736
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,081
Can I finish this first?

737
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:13,849
Sure. There's no rush.

738
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,371
Holy shit!

739
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,047
Wow!

740
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:58,522
Mr Hasumi?

741
01:23:58,720 --> 01:23:59,881
Over here.

742
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,687
Do you have service?

743
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:15,602
My phone?

744
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,966
No service. Why?

745
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,770
Jamming?

746
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:31,400
Hasumin.

747
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:34,762
What's going on?

748
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:40,330
Wow!

749
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:41,970
That's great, sir!

750
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:44,043
Play with us at the festival.

751
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,245
Who, me?

752
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,122
You're really good!

753
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:52,801
Buy some juice.

754
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:53,688
Yeah?

755
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,524
Thanks!

756
01:24:55,680 --> 01:25:01,801
Is it true you guys and Hayami
were cheating with cell phones?

757
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,448
So what?

758
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:08,525
And all the phones said
"no service" then, too?

759
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,408
I had Shibahara all wrong.

760
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:18,322
Yeah!

761
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,970
He should play.

762
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,167
Will he?

763
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:23,687
We'll talk him into it.

764
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,127
You should hear Mr Shibahara!

765
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,806
All of you, stay where you are.

766
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:38,211
Uh, sir... Wait...
you're from Class 1.

767
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:45,803
Sir, is that a...

768
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,241
Hasumi?

769
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,251
What the fuck?!

770
01:26:58,920 --> 01:26:59,887
Miya?

771
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,845
I heard a noise.

772
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:15,563
Move! Turn off the music!

773
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:16,568
Turn it off!

774
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:24,206
What's wrong?

775
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:37,084
Your attention, please.
There is an intruder in the school.

776
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:40,050
I repeat, we have an intruder.

777
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:43,522
He is dangerous. Do not
go to the 1st floor.

778
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:47,846
Do not panic. Remain calm.

779
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:52,006
Get to the top floor. The
intruder has a shotgun.

780
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:56,246
Go to the roof, lock the
door, and wait for help.

781
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:08,770
A shotgun?

782
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:11,611
No way!

783
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,490
Let's do what he said!

784
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:19,570
Wait a minute!

785
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,165
Something's weird.

786
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:23,322
Hasumin's on the 1st floor!

787
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:24,880
He could get hurt!

788
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:25,643
No!

789
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,371
Maybe we can't trust him!

790
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,126
Tell them!

791
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:44,968
Stay here!

792
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,691
How's that going to help?!

793
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:50,530
I'm trusting Hasumin.

794
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:51,562
Let go!

795
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:57,726
Go to the top floor. The
intruder has a shotgun.

796
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:02,001
Go to the roof, lock the
door, and wait for help.

797
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,163
We need to go!

798
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:14,160
United we stand, divided we fall.

799
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,480
Had I taught them that yet?

800
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:26,687
Come on!

801
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:29,281
What's wrong?!

802
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,046
Kakeru's downstairs.

803
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,964
Maybe he got shot.

804
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:35,008
Where?!

805
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,121
Satomi...

806
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:48,060
Quick!

807
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:51,202
Hurry!

808
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:54,769
Open it!

809
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:56,524
It's locked!!

810
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:57,682
Wait!

811
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:00,320
Someone outside locked it!

812
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:01,481
Ayumi?

813
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:04,843
Is anyone out there?! Open up!

814
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,007
Miya!

815
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:09,643
What about trying a landline?

816
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,240
The pay phone?

817
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,443
Or in the staff room.

818
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,610
Let's split up.

819
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:18,488
Hurry!

820
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:23,085
If he gets Kakeru, we haven't got a chance!

821
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,001
Naoki...“

822
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,367
Satomi!

823
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:44,126
Satomi!

824
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:45,882
It's OK.

825
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:47,801
Stay here.

826
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:58,449
Let's close the fire shutters
and build a barricade.

827
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:08,126
It's dead!

828
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:19,049
We can't call help!

829
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:26,960
Come on!

830
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:40,402
Don't shoot!

831
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:42,605
Don't shoot!

832
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:45,606
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

833
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:56,761
Don't shoot!

834
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:38,686
It's not very likely you'll
get two with one shot.

835
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:41,571
Why?!

836
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:45,247
Why are you doing this, Hasumin?!

837
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,122
This is Mr Kume's doing.

838
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:04,329
It's no good us all bunched up like this!

839
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:06,165
Split up and hide!

840
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:06,889
Suzuki...

841
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,488
Let him go!

842
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:10,681
But...

843
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:14,561
I'm going, too.

844
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:15,728
Miho!

845
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,046
Me, too!

846
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,808
You fool! What are you doing?!

847
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:28,205
Don't call me a fool.

848
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:28,963
Hey!

849
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:32,324
Quick! Move it!

850
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:37,527
Masahiko!

851
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:57,166
Miya Yasuhara

852
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:19,130
Hey, Partner!

853
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:34,121
Hey, partner!

854
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:38,402
How about a little more enthusiasm.

855
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:45,410
Mack The Knife

856
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,850
Who's there?

857
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:32,366
Hasumin...

858
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:39,167
Hasumin?

859
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:40,481
Madoka?

860
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,691
Hasumin!

861
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:51,531
We did what you told us, sir!

862
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:24,929
Why?

863
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:46,691
Hasumin!

864
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:06,888
Stop!

865
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,884
Hasumin! Why?

866
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:27,602
Why didn't you close the window, stupid!

867
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:34,645
It's your fault! It serves you right!

868
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:06,647
Tade“.

869
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:11,282
Tade's dead, isn't he.

870
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:18,008
You killed him, didn't you!

871
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:30,927
Hey! Call the police!

872
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:32,605
Call the police!

873
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:34,205
What?!

874
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:36,124
Call the police!

875
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:38,169
There's a guy at the school...

876
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:39,651
with a shotgun!

877
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:41,001
That school?

878
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:43,084
Your student card...

879
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,011
Hurry!

880
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:49,130
OK, I'm calling!

881
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:50,486
Hang on!

882
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,207
Hello? Is this the police?

883
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:59,126
There's a man with a gun at
a high school near here.

884
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:01,004
A shotgun!

885
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:04,165
At Shinko Academy.

886
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:12,010
I'm taking...

887
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:13,680
Satomi...

888
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:18,041
with me.

889
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:28,740
Satomi!

890
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:33,722
He said the Club Room.

891
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:38,281
No way!

892
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:40,241
Way, maybe.

893
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:44,964
It might work.

894
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:48,126
She's the guinea pig?

895
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:50,486
Are you nuts?!

896
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:53,886
Satomi...

897
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:10,166
Don't! It'll never work!

898
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:15,566
Yukio?

899
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:20,561
Is that you?

900
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:24,448
Yes.

901
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:13,971
Satomi!

902
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:37,363
Satomi!

903
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:55,250
Kakeru!

904
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:03,961
Kakeru!

905
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:07,328
Hey bro

906
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:10,921
Looks like we're out of time...

907
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:39,326
Oh, Shit!

908
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:53,240
No, we're OK.

909
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:58,044
It's a fire shutter. That's what it's for.

910
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:01,330
That's right.

911
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:06,123
We'll get help before it's too late.

912
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:07,641
I know it.

913
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:11,921
We just have to hang in till then.

914
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:39,651
Why didn't anyone untie that?!

915
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:42,728
Why didn't you?!

916
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:44,921
Shut up!

917
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:48,521
Someone untie it!

918
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:50,801
Go on!

919
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:56,529
It's that stupid cow's fault
for going out that way!

920
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:02,248
You said it might work!

921
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:06,841
Fuck you!

922
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:12,211
Hasumin...

923
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:30,162
Stay back!

924
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:41,246
Keep away!

925
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:05,084
Out Of my way!

926
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:34,281
Reika!

927
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:43,720
Shit!

928
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:49,041
Sir...

929
01:50:57,200 --> 01:51:03,481
I have to get into Todai University...

930
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:07,602
To die?

931
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:17,562
The chute.

932
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:19,003
Chute?

933
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:21,726
The emergency-escape chute.

934
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:27,206
He'd see it as soon as we put it down!

935
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:31,725
Wait...

936
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:35,207
That just might work.

937
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:37,402
Come on!

938
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:09,726
No time to think.

939
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:13,643
Shit!

940
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:20,249
Sorry, Tohru!

941
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:24,405
But I've got to do this!

942
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:25,800
Yuichiro?

943
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:33,087
Reika...

944
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:35,930
trust me.

945
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:38,811
Do what I say.

946
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:44,608
OK.

947
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:00,649
Whose shoes are these?

948
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:10,126
You're going to frame Mr Kume?

949
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:12,801
Great!

950
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:20,171
I warned him to keep his
hands off the students.

951
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:22,805
No matter...

952
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:28,003
how beautiful.

953
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:35,321
Mr Kume went crazy and,
taking all the students with him...

954
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:39,371
committed love-suicide with you.

955
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:45,244
That's a pretty wild story, though.

956
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:48,602
That's crazy...

957
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:15,131
That's everyone.

958
01:56:17,320 --> 01:56:18,970
Happy graduation.

959
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:33,046
Mr Kume, the Art teacher,
was involved with a male student.

960
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:39,890
He entered the school with a shotgun,
attacked and handcuffed me...

961
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:40,768
and then...

962
01:57:44,240 --> 01:57:49,565
shot the students,
the Gym teacher, and himself.

963
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:17,640
A girl the Gym teacher had harassed
also threw herself off the roof.

964
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:30,444
But it might be hard to
fit that into the story.

965
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:35,005
Anyway, there's no need to think too hard.

966
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:43,129
It's not me who has to
think up a simple explanation.

967
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:47,448
It's the police.

968
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:16,649
Here.

969
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:18,730
Thanks!

970
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:30,171
Two survivors!

971
01:59:58,560 --> 01:59:59,846
You two...

972
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:08,842
I can't believe you managed
to live through that.

973
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:17,282
As your home-room teacher,
I'm proud of you.

974
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:30,403
You son of a bitch! Go
fuck yourself, Hasumi!

975
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:32,164
You did it! All of it!

976
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:34,120
Fuck you, Hasumi!

977
02:00:35,680 --> 02:00:37,205
He's the one who did it!

978
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:39,805
You bastard!

979
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:42,088
Hasumi!

980
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:44,447
Cut it out!

981
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:47,411
Stay away from me, Hasumi!

982
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:49,890
You bastard!

983
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:51,884
Hasumi!

984
02:01:04,240 --> 02:01:05,924
The proof was in...

985
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:09,680
the nurse's office.

986
02:01:16,680 --> 02:01:20,048
Hey! Don't touch that!

987
02:01:23,600 --> 02:01:25,045
Replaying-

988
02:01:26,760 --> 02:01:30,128
It's not very likely you'll
get two with one shot.

989
02:01:32,120 --> 02:01:33,326
Why?!

990
02:01:33,880 --> 02:01:37,282
Why are you doing this, Hasumin?!

991
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:39,724
This is Mr Kume's doing.

992
02:02:04,680 --> 02:02:07,001
Keisuke's alive, right?

993
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:15,008
He's alive, right?

994
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:17,330
Right?!

995
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:36,326
I'm sorry.

996
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:44,366
I'm really sorry.

997
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:55,650
This was all the will of God.

998
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:01,565
He gave me orders.

999
02:03:06,160 --> 02:03:10,882
I had to kill everyone,
all the demons in Class 4...

1000
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:15,565
to save their souls...

1001
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:17,881
Muninn.

1002
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:41,402
Say hello to Odin for me.

1003
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:46,605
God's will?

1004
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:51,840
He's crazy.

1005
02:03:53,560 --> 02:03:57,929
The bastard's completely crazy!

1006
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:02,200
No.

1007
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:05,720
No?

1008
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:12,846
He's just starting the next game.

1009
02:04:22,680 --> 02:04:26,366
Magnificent!

1010
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:41,088
Let's go, partner.

1011
02:04:42,760 --> 02:04:46,367
No way we will be found responsible...

1012
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:19,841
Hasumin...

1013
