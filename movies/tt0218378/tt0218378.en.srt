KINGDOM COME
SIERRA NEVADA, CALIFORNIA, 1867

3
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,305
Come on, Buddy,
at the end of the city.

4
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,943
Let them go, Buddy.

5
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,202
Buddy!

6
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,418
Well, ladies, let's go.

7
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,171
I'm Vauneen.
I'll take care of you.

8
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:12,508
Go down and we'll put you
to work very soon.

9
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,177
Gentlemen, place
your firearms.

10
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,513
- Why?
- It's the law.

11
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,516
These weapons belong
the railway.

12
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,059
Not matter.

13
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,771
Mr. Dillon said:
"No guns to town."

14
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,189
Do not take them.

15
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:30,984
- Let them!
- Otherwise, you do not enter here.

16
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:34,947
We are happy to cooperate.
Give them your weapons.

17
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,989
Help me.

18
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,783
Come back!

19
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,410
Ilfaut clean
and wash.

20
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,663
It is clean.

21
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,457
It is not with me.
Come on, girls.

22
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,836
Take me to the dollar into gold.

23
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,004
- I do not understand.
- Come, Hope.

24
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,131
Come on, just a little turn.

25
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,062
Stop! Disperse!

26
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,358
Disperse! Go away!

27
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,487
Help me to remove the harness.

28
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,073
Come on, guys.
Separate yourselves. Move away.

29
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,242
- Stay away.
- Thank you.

30
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,787
I did not want
it torments you.

31
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,623
- You are the railroad?
- Yes.

32
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:30,043
I am the Chief Engineer
Central Pacific.

33
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,713
- I came to see Mr. Dillon.
- It's true.

34
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,214
You have family?

35
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:37,926
It's not my family.
I carry the baggage anyway.

36
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:41,305
- Very nice.
- It's the least we can do.

37
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,102
Did you hear that, Mom?
He wants to see Mr. Dillon.

38
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,396
Come on, guys.
We go to the warehouse.

39
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:50,731
Hurry up!

40
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,654
What is your name?

41
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,406
Hope. Hope Burn.

42
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,909
It's a pretty name.

43
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,327
Thank you.

44
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,373
What brings you
here in Kingdom Come?

45
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,126
We visit
to the family.

46
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,212
How many people live here?

47
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,630
1200.

48
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,843
- I'm waiting here for bags.
- Thank you.

49
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,275
I do not
herbs, Hope.

50
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,154
I'm on it.

51
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,485
Dalglish, if you want
wait here,

52
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,445
I'll see
if Mr. Dillon is ready.

53
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,656
Fernando, give him drink.

54
00:05:58,317 --> 00:05:59,526
Come in.

55
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,031
The engineer of the railways.

56
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,240
It is how?

57
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,826
It's a blue. No problems.

58
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,792
Mr. Dillon will receive you,
Mr. Dalglish.

59
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,515
Mr. Dillon, he is here.

60
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:33,018
Choose a number.

61
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,479
I do not play.
I like to drink.

62
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,899
Get it in a number.
It will be finished before your glass.

63
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:42,986
- It's your money.
- I just give it to you.

64
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,281
I do not accept
gifts, Mr. Dillon.

65
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,033
Not matter.

66
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,285
You think I bought?

67
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,956
- You would not be the first.
- It is down to the hotel.

68
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:57,417
I said you had
a new bed, but no way.

69
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,470
This is when your birthday?

70
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:09,638
In September.

71
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,559
On 23.

72
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,436
I met a traveler
come of an ancient land ...

73
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,273
who said: "Two vast
legs of stone ... "

74
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,570
"Near them, on the sands ...

75
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,115
"Lay a face
half-buried ...

76
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,158
"Whose lips
crumpled and wrinkled ... "

77
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,660
Zero.

78
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,290
- I lost your money.
- Do not worry.

79
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,501
The casino is to it.

80
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,545
- Your song was beautiful.
- Thank you.

81
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:43,839
Mr. Dalglish works
for railways.

82
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:46,800
Dalglish? What as the name?

83
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,136
- It's Scottish.
- 0h, Scotland.

84
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:51,013
How romantic.

85
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:56,185
Look at my work, while O
powerful, and despair-you!

86
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,020
The town of Kingdom Come ...

87
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,396
would wish
welcome ...

88
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,440
the Company
Pacific Railway.

89
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,862
In their honor ...

90
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,864
all dances
are free.

91
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,368
Do you women!

92
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,546
Gentlemen?

93
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,715
Let me introduce you
two lovely ladies.

94
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:29,968
The French name is Sue.
It will supplement your education.

95
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,929
- And this is Annie.
- Good evening.

96
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,680
I need to be educated?

97
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,642
He took lessons
by San Francisco.

98
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,602
You come from far away.

99
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,188
Will you refuse such
ladies? It is an insult.

100
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,732
He has his views on anyone.

101
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,067
There, you?

102
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,319
No, she arrived
in care.

103
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,988
A woman from the East.
They have no type.

104
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,199
I Luif forget.

105
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,534
You dance?

106
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:55,994
With Mr. Dillon, only.

107
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,915
I did not offend you.

108
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:03,377
- I am not.
- But I am.

109
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,339
- I did not offend you.
- How will I get over it?

110
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,929
I apologize.
Dufond heart.

111
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,305
My God! What a voice!

112
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:41,517
He is young.

113
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,106
- Younger than you.
- More beautiful than you.

114
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:53,695
No one is more
beautiful than me.

115
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,827
It is not more beautiful than you.

116
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,337
Ouch! My hair!

117
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,173
You're hurting me.

118
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:17,135
- You like to hurt me.
- No.

119
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,149
Vauneen ...

120
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,069
- Give us another whiskey.
- And a whiskey.

121
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,280
Mr. Dalglish, railways.

122
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,781
Enchanted.

123
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,576
Welcome. You will
well treated. You want to smoke?

124
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,452
A cigar?

125
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,207
Vauneen! Come!

126
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,959
God!

127
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,088
Sweetley! Stop it!
What tufais?

128
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,757
What's going on?

129
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,927
He tried to pay me with this.

130
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:02,389
- It's my bag of gold.
- He lost the card.

131
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,725
I never heard
that Delaney was playing.

132
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:08,228
That's why he lost.
Lack of experience.

133
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:11,023
You'd better
introduce you to Mr. Dillon.

134
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,400
Tomorrow at dawn. Get out.

135
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,319
The show is over.

136
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,447
Let it work.
A tour here.

137
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,781
It's coming.

138
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,659
- Why not lock them up?
- No need.

139
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,287
Failure to appear
not Dillon,

140
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:26,622
they must leave the city.

141
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:30,918
It is a city clean.
It's good for the company.

142
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,463
And you! Going on.
Sorry, it's mine.

143
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,382
Why not both?

144
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,637
Down the hall,
The bed birds.

145
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,305
We want to treat it.

146
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,975
Have a good week.

147
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,478
Take it easy,
the girls. He is young.

148
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,648
- Where is he?
- At the end of the corridor.

149
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,816
It's been hours
I wait.

150
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:58,654
Ilfaudra wait.
Have you brought the train into town?

151
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,989
You've missed the boat again, Jim.

152
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,867
Come on, do not mind.

153
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,205
It's true that you will choose
the name of the station?

154
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:09,790
Give him my name.

155
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,917
- What is your name?
- Sarah.

156
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:16,880
He'll call Sue, like me.

157
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,006
Sue City.

158
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:22,803
The railway
is the largest ...

159
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,137
of all American history.

160
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,806
It's not you who selected.

161
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:28,016
- Ilfaut deserve it.
- No kidding, really?

162
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,601
Yes.

163
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,853
Sorry.

164
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,647
Why it is called Sue?

165
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,899
Because I
fuck you so deep ...

166
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,192
so, so deep ...

167
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:40,988
that your cock will be found
somewhere in California.

168
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:01,967
Come here, quick.

169
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:11,268
That's him.

170
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,561
It's Mr. Dillon.

171
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,648
He, on the horse?

172
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,209
Here, take this.

173
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:40,964
Give them to Mr. Dillon.

174
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,382
A one else.

175
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,428
How are you?

176
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,679
Hurry up.

177
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:49,890
I ...

178
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,936
Harry Grimes,
concession Roughwood,

179
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,897
November 30 this year,

180
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:59,233
have been found guilty
of intentionally ...

181
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,777
racked color and dust
Mr. Delaney gold ...

182
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,779
when he was
drunk and asleep.

183
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,992
I know I was wrong.

184
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:12,287
I deserve punishment.

185
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:17,125
The normal sentence
is 50 blows.

186
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:20,921
Mr. Dillon was transferred to 25 ...

187
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:23,632
because he knows that this
will not happen again.

188
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,976
The show is over,
guys!

189
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,686
Go home!

190
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,362
Mr. Dillon!

191
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,703
I was told to give you this.

192
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:36,079
What is it?

193
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:39,791
This is the part of Mrs. Burn.

194
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,344
Hope you are?

195
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:02,189
Mr. Dillon.

196
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:03,482
Burn miss!

197
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,570
- Can I accompany you?
- Yes.

198
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,157
Mr. Dillon is your parent?

199
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,326
Yes, indeed.

200
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:16,078
Our rich parent.

201
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,123
It's good to have
a parent like him.

202
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,585
Unless he does hunting
with a whip.

203
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:40,018
In many cities,
this man would have been lynched.

204
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,980
Mr. Dillon has probably
saved his life.

205
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,440
Have you ever seen a lynching?

206
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:48,151
J'aifailli lynched
myself, once.

207
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,487
- Really?
- A city waiting ...

208
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:52,155
its railway.

209
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:55,617
I had to tell them that
pass 25 km to the north.

210
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:58,370
The idea of ??a rope to the coup
I would change my mind.

211
00:17:58,412 --> 00:17:59,538
But no.

212
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,294
It must be fascinating
to be in the nature ...

213
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:08,297
with the lynchers, grizzly bears
and wild Indians.

214
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,756
It is.

215
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:13,677
Can I accompany you?

216
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,264
It's not very pleasant.

217
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:20,601
I am strong.
I do not slow you down.

218
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,354
- Okay.
- When?

219
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:26,106
Tomorrow morning.

220
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:28,442
The path
above the city.

221
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:30,944
We will return in the evening.

222
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:34,239
It makes me happy.
Thank you, Mr. Dalglish.

223
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,951
See you tomorrow.

224
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:08,852
Look!

225
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:20,197
I Dufeu and eat ...
if you want.

226
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,844
It's pork stew.

227
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:44,054
I have a bowl.

228
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,982
- Where are you from?
- In Dublin.

229
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,317
- And you?
- In Poland.

230
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,527
Want to drink?

231
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:01,530
Thank you.

232
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:06,243
I have not seen a woman ...

233
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:08,745
long time.

234
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:10,873
I understand.

235
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:15,961
- You have found?
- There is no gold in America.

236
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:18,422
No more gold than elephants.

237
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,059
It provides no pleasure.

238
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:33,854
A man loses his courage.

239
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:38,609
Even if it discovers
a pool, he loses.

240
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,235
There's more?

241
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:43,447
I do not need gold.

242
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:49,286
I need a woman.

243
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:51,205
Take that.

244
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:54,291
- On exchange.
- You do not part with.

245
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:58,128
I dragged on for six months
on this forsaken land.

246
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:05,761
I started with two mules,
a cart and luggage.

247
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:09,932
- I no longer owns it.
- You do not possess me.

248
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:12,351
The concession.

249
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:15,938
I give you the concession.

250
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:30,869
- Daniel.
- Shut up. Let me think.

251
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:35,958
I take the child as well.

252
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:38,252
I will be happy.

253
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,921
Want to sell your child?

254
00:23:44,675 --> 00:23:46,301
I'm serious.

255
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:28,719
This is my breath.

256
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:35,017
You see how
he clings to coal?

257
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:41,148
Yes, he has taken.

258
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:45,861
More slowly.

259
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:58,582
It warms the outside ...

260
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,001
and when it's hot ...

261
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:03,170
you pass on your face,
your hands ...

262
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:04,713
Get warm all day.

263
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:05,964
Thank you.

264
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:11,595
- You want good shoes?
- It's OK.

265
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:14,264
- You're not cold?
- No.

266
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:19,019
- Tell me if your feet are freezing.
- I come from pioneer.

267
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:20,729
My father was one.

268
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:24,191
My mother also.

269
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:27,194
I was a baby when all
California was like that.

270
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:31,490
They found gold?

271
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:33,075
A little.

272
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:34,243
Not enough.

273
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:41,667
They never
said as it was beautiful.

274
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,669
It's beautiful.

275
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,004
HowTo mount
a train here?

276
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:48,841
Ilfautfaire jump
the mountain.

277
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:50,884
That may be what will be done.

278
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,595
Tunneling.

279
00:27:06,168 --> 00:27:08,629
Can I have
more water for my mother?

280
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:11,173
- Of course.
- Thank you.

281
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:12,508
You're welcome.

282
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:19,306
- Miss Burn?
- Yes?

283
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:21,850
We have a mutual friend.

284
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:25,646
A Mr. Dalglish?

285
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:26,980
Oh, yes.

286
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:31,527
My name is Lucia.

287
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:33,946
Enchanted. Mine is Hope.

288
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:35,989
- It's a pretty name.
- Thank you.

289
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,075
You can call me Lucy.

290
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:41,745
I came to ask you
from Dillon ...

291
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:43,872
if you wanted
visit us.

292
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:45,707
Oh, yes. Thank you.

293
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:47,084
When?

294
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:49,211
- Here's your water.
- Thank you.

295
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:51,463
Whenever you want.
Now, if you want.

296
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:53,966
I'm not sure.

297
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:56,093
- My mother ...
- Oh, come with your mother.

298
00:27:57,469 --> 00:27:59,930
- I will ask.
- I'm waiting here.

299
00:27:59,972 --> 00:28:01,139
Okay.

300
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:16,738
Dillon is below.

301
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:19,575
I must visit him.

302
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:21,243
- You too.
- Dillon?

303
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:23,620
It is below.

304
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:33,213
- She knows we're here?
- Mr. Dalglish told him.

305
00:28:33,255 --> 00:28:35,674
- Can I go?
- Yes.

306
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:37,759
Cap up.

307
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,596
- I have no time. She waits.
- It will wait.

308
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:45,392
Come here.

309
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,729
Do not talk too much there.

310
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,023
Okay? Answer when
it speaks to you.

311
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:54,443
About Dillon.
Say nothing of yourself.

312
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:56,653
Do not worry.
I know quoifaire.

313
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:00,449
Goodbye.

314
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:09,833
- Where are you, Hope?
- In Boston.

315
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:16,507
I would go to Boston.

316
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:20,427
Tonight, Mr. Dalglish will fall
madly in love with you.

317
00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:22,137
I do not think.

318
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:25,182
- Why would he do?
- Because you will be splendid.

319
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:27,476
Let moifaire.
We captives.

320
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,190
I tried to do
like San Francisco.

321
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:47,204
Exactly.

322
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:53,752
- Let's start.
- Okay.

323
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:12,271
What do you think of the form?

324
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:17,401
I've never worn
like it. I do not know.

325
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:19,820
Here is the skirt that goes with it.

326
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:21,530
She is so beautiful.

327
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:27,744
- You can change the lace.
- It will be too big?

328
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:29,538
We can fix that.

329
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:36,295
Come on, guys. Move
boxes and boards!

330
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:41,550
Thank you.

331
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:45,721
We want to get
before nightfall. Go!

332
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:50,601
Go on. Keep it up!

333
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:21,191
Ladies ...

334
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:23,068
Ladies and gentlemen ...

335
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,028
we have a guest tonight.

336
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,698
A distinguished pianist
you just heard ...

337
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:32,536
and a famous actress
throughout the Americas.

338
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:33,871
Hope Burn miss.

339
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:45,841
There is a gorge ...

340
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:48,510
- What a beautiful song.
- Thank you.

341
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:49,803
What was she talking about?

342
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:51,889
It's a song about
the homeland of my ancestors.

343
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,849
- Portugal.
- You know what?

344
00:32:53,891 --> 00:32:56,185
She has a mole
on the buttock.

345
00:32:59,438 --> 00:33:01,899
The neighbors liked
the charming girl.

346
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,650
Calm down!

347
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:08,572
All of you!

348
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:13,160
Continue.

349
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:15,787
Then one day
a letter arrived ...

350
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:17,748
with its passage already paid ...

351
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:21,043
for land flowing
Missouri and Mississippi.

352
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:25,255
She made her luggage
and everything was ready ...

353
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:27,591
and a day at the door ...

354
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:31,470
the widow, the brokenhearted,
separated from her Noreen Bawn.

355
00:33:31,512 --> 00:33:32,804
I'm going to change.

356
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:35,390
The widow waited
many years.

357
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:40,020
But one evening through the door,
a slender woman entered.

358
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:43,148
It was
expensive clothes.

359
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,609
She said: "Mother,
you know me?

360
00:33:45,651 --> 00:33:48,362
"I only caught a cold."

361
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:50,906
But two scarlet spots
his cheeks ...

362
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:52,533
told
their sad story.

363
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:56,495
There is a grave
Old Shooting Connail ...

364
00:33:56,537 --> 00:33:58,622
where the wild flowers
stir gently.

365
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:03,085
An old woman sobbing
kneeling at the grave.

366
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:06,588
She said:
"Noreen, you hear me?

367
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:09,591
"I am alone
since you left.

368
00:34:10,676 --> 00:34:12,094
"The curse
of emigration ...

369
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:14,054
"Put you there, my Noreen Bawn."

370
00:34:23,856 --> 00:34:25,691
Daniel, stop!

371
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:29,278
Come!

372
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:58,932
So, dear youth
and tender girls ...

373
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:00,726
think before you leave.

374
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:02,978
Your humble
Irish houses ...

375
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,772
you do not see
that there really.

376
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:09,276
What gold and pleasure
without his health and strength?

377
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:14,531
If you are thinking of emigrating,
remember Noreen Bawn.

378
00:35:30,631 --> 00:35:32,966
It's been years ...

379
00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:34,092
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

380
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:36,386
- It was lovely.
- Thank you.

381
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:37,679
Sing, Dalglish.

382
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:39,598
- Sing! Sing!
- Oh, no!

383
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:42,684
- Sing!
- No!

384
00:35:42,726 --> 00:35:44,603
Sing! Sing!

385
00:35:44,645 --> 00:35:45,896
I know this ballad.

386
00:35:50,651 --> 00:35:52,903
I recited
often to my father.

387
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:54,822
He was still crying at the end.

388
00:35:57,324 --> 00:35:58,534
How was it?

389
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:02,371
My father?

390
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:03,705
You are not parents?

391
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:06,375
Mom said you
are related by marriage.

392
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:11,088
Oh, Shenandoah

393
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:14,716
Because I miss you

394
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:15,884
It's too high.

395
00:36:15,926 --> 00:36:18,262
Again. Again.

396
00:36:18,303 --> 00:36:20,138
- Do it again.
- Right now?

397
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:24,226
Do you have children?

398
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:25,352
Children?

399
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:30,732
Oh, Shenandoah

400
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:33,569
Because I miss you

401
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:39,241
In the distance, river flood

402
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,911
Oh, Shenandoah

403
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:46,582
As I hear you

404
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,752
Away

405
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:53,922
I am far

406
00:36:53,964 --> 00:37:01,096
I crossed the great Missouri

407
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:06,810
No.

408
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:09,271
Stop it.

409
00:37:11,023 --> 00:37:12,608
You are special.

410
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,068
Really?

411
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,904
Very special.

412
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:18,822
No, you say that ...

413
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:24,286
and then you go with your big
nitroglycerin box ...

414
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:26,246
and you never come back.

415
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:28,499
If I come back.

416
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:32,336
What are you doing in the hallway?
You have men in there.

417
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:33,921
The job before the cigarette.

418
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:38,217
Bellanger. The time has passed.

419
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:39,968
I want money.

420
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,178
- Annie?
- Yes.

421
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,472
No gifts. Go!

422
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:47,142
- On the table.
- I know.

423
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:49,436
- Now.
- Where have you gone?

424
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:54,107
- It goes well ...
- It takes me another 30 dollars.

425
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:56,443
Mary, it is not there?

426
00:37:56,485 --> 00:38:01,281
Bring your ass over here.
You do wait.

427
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:03,450
Going to do your job.

428
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:06,370
Dillon asked
from you.

429
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:09,289
What did you say?

430
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:13,001
You were a researcher
gold and should be wary.

431
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:15,462
You are very perceptive.

432
00:38:17,297 --> 00:38:19,925
I have to go again tomorrow.

433
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:22,219
I must consider
the next valley.

434
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:23,637
You come back?

435
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:26,056
Yes.

436
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:33,689
- What are you looking for?
- My turn.

437
00:38:36,024 --> 00:38:36,984
It is there.

438
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:41,989
It was a good night.

439
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:44,533
Yes? How?

440
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:47,119
$ 900 and 4 ounces.

441
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,246
It's good.

442
00:38:49,288 --> 00:38:52,291
One of them pays Annie
for each minute of the day.

443
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:55,544
- I liked your song.
- Thank you.

444
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:57,880
Ilfaudrait
watch your man.

445
00:38:57,921 --> 00:39:01,800
- As he looked at the small ...
- I beg you.

446
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:03,719
Well, it's just a child.

447
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,721
You were a
when he found you.

448
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:08,265
It Luif
marry an engineer.

449
00:39:08,307 --> 00:39:11,393
I know very well
what I do.

450
00:39:11,435 --> 00:39:13,103
- Good night.
- Good night.

451
00:39:17,065 --> 00:39:18,358
Back to work.

452
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,835
I do not think
that you will return.

453
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:38,879
Of course there is.

454
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:41,006
I leave luggage here.

455
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:42,674
And me?

456
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:49,264
You'll come back looking
your luggage and you will let me.

457
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:50,933
I'll be back for you too.

458
00:39:52,893 --> 00:39:55,604
You think more
in your luggage to me.

459
00:39:57,689 --> 00:39:59,107
Go to sleep now.

460
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,004
It's going in the room
Mrs. Burn.

461
00:40:21,046 --> 00:40:23,257
At the top of the stairs, right?

462
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:33,433
It's almost frozen.

463
00:40:44,528 --> 00:40:45,904
It's so pretty.

464
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:48,824
- It seems not stupid?
- It suits you very well.

465
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:52,828
Thank you, Mom.

466
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:55,122
Where do I ask this, Madame?

467
00:40:55,164 --> 00:40:56,832
Oh, that.

468
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:02,671
Mr. Dillon sent me
you up, ma'am.

469
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:05,674
I am not a package.

470
00:41:05,716 --> 00:41:08,552
No. I wait for you outside.

471
00:41:08,594 --> 00:41:09,595
Miss.

472
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:12,181
Mom.

473
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:14,308
Look at that.

474
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:43,670
That's it. I will
help you down.

475
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:46,340
How are you?

476
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:52,346
- You wait there.
- OK, Dan.

477
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:36,390
They say you're sick.

478
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:41,353
I am dying.

479
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:48,652
Burn died.

480
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:52,906
It did not leave anything.

481
00:42:57,035 --> 00:42:59,037
I do not want that Hope suffers.

482
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:02,040
I hope you either.

483
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,963
Coffee?

484
00:43:15,387 --> 00:43:17,389
I want $ 200 a year.

485
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:19,766
That's it.

486
00:43:22,186 --> 00:43:24,313
If it's too, we can negotiate.

487
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:30,611
But I want
a written promise.

488
00:43:34,156 --> 00:43:35,908
I no longer drink, Elena.

489
00:43:38,494 --> 00:43:41,121
I want you to know.

490
00:43:41,163 --> 00:43:42,873
I need money.

491
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:50,464
I need money for Hope.

492
00:43:57,554 --> 00:43:58,680
Does she know?

493
00:44:21,578 --> 00:44:23,539
It's cold here here.

494
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,165
Sweetley you deposit.

495
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:51,024
Mr. DeWolf.

496
00:44:52,151 --> 00:44:53,569
Mr. Dillon.

497
00:44:55,946 --> 00:44:57,281
Remain seated.

498
00:44:57,322 --> 00:44:59,658
- Hello, Mr. Dillon.
- Open the door.

499
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:53,462
Oh, Dillon ... my love.

500
00:46:36,255 --> 00:46:37,923
What is it?

501
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:39,299
A gift.

502
00:46:56,316 --> 00:46:57,609
And that?

503
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:00,821
The titles of the show.

504
00:47:00,904 --> 00:47:02,156
It is yours.

505
00:47:06,577 --> 00:47:07,703
Why?

506
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:11,456
We have to finish this.

507
00:47:14,376 --> 00:47:15,669
What are you talking?

508
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,963
It is a comfortable settlement.
You will not ...

509
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:19,715
I am not a whore!

510
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:22,384
I do not want.

511
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:26,221
Tell me why.

512
00:47:26,263 --> 00:47:29,057
- The titles of the tobacco ...
- Stop with that!

513
00:47:30,058 --> 00:47:32,561
- Why?
- It's impossible.

514
00:47:32,603 --> 00:47:35,898
You think I do not know.
It is this girl.

515
00:47:35,939 --> 00:47:38,609
You want to fuck her!
Sort of ... pig!

516
00:48:35,457 --> 00:48:38,043
As soon as one has passed
the mountain, I will leave.

517
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:41,296
- You will see.
- You always say that.

518
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:42,965
She has one child.

519
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:44,550
Annie?

520
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:47,886
She left him in Sacramento.
We'll get him.

521
00:48:49,346 --> 00:48:52,307
It will not be a life
with a kid.

522
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:54,643
I will find
a piece of land ...

523
00:48:54,685 --> 00:48:56,854
and I'm going to
build a house.

524
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,818
Bellanger, you are
so full of shit.

525
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,112
You did not sit
since 1862.

526
00:49:05,154 --> 00:49:06,864
I sat down.

527
00:49:06,905 --> 00:49:07,948
Where?

528
00:49:08,991 --> 00:49:11,493
In a brothel in San Francisco.

529
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:34,183
It is too narrow, boss.

530
00:49:34,224 --> 00:49:36,894
- We will never build here.
- I've seen worse.

531
00:49:50,032 --> 00:49:52,701
Come on, guys.
Bring the nitro.

532
00:49:52,743 --> 00:49:54,953
Cross far.

533
00:49:54,995 --> 00:49:56,872
Go right to the edge.

534
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:01,043
It peutfaire skip the rock.

535
00:50:01,084 --> 00:50:02,419
Where?

536
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:03,921
There.

537
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:18,977
It's good.

538
00:50:22,981 --> 00:50:25,275
Lord God!

539
00:50:25,317 --> 00:50:26,944
Thomas!

540
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:55,430
"Surely goodness
and mercy ...

541
00:50:55,472 --> 00:50:57,349
"Be with me all my life ...

542
00:50:57,391 --> 00:51:00,102
"And I will always
in the house of the Lord.

543
00:51:01,144 --> 00:51:02,271
"Amen."

544
00:51:02,312 --> 00:51:03,814
Amen.

545
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:31,508
You can not pass.
You know that.

546
00:51:33,802 --> 00:51:36,221
The train will stop
not to Kingdom Come?

547
00:51:36,263 --> 00:51:37,848
So what?

548
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:39,892
And Annie, then?

549
00:51:39,933 --> 00:51:41,768
There 's plenty of Annies.

550
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,981
But it is not Annie
you think.

551
00:52:18,055 --> 00:52:19,806
Be careful
where you put it.

552
00:52:19,848 --> 00:52:20,807
Hey, John?

553
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:26,063
T.J., you ready?

554
00:52:31,944 --> 00:52:34,696
Come on, guys. Walk straight.

555
00:52:34,738 --> 00:52:36,240
Ready?

556
00:52:36,281 --> 00:52:37,825
Fire!

557
00:52:48,585 --> 00:52:50,587
Straighten up and there!

558
00:52:51,964 --> 00:52:53,382
Fire!

559
00:53:03,517 --> 00:53:04,977
Fire!

560
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:15,279
Fire!

561
00:53:18,907 --> 00:53:20,576
Continues to descend, T.J.!

562
00:53:23,162 --> 00:53:24,997
Straighten up there!

563
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:27,791
Fire!

564
00:53:57,321 --> 00:53:58,405
Mom.

565
00:53:59,781 --> 00:54:01,950
There is music out.

566
00:54:40,864 --> 00:54:42,074
Mrs. and Miss Burn,

567
00:54:42,115 --> 00:54:44,910
Mr. Dillon asked
the pleasure of your company.

568
00:54:46,161 --> 00:54:48,831
- When?
- Now.

569
00:54:50,165 --> 00:54:51,500
Why?

570
00:54:51,542 --> 00:54:54,711
Dillon wants
tell you in person.

571
00:55:21,697 --> 00:55:23,907
Come on, straighten it!

572
00:56:00,235 --> 00:56:01,945
Ms. Burn ...

573
00:56:03,155 --> 00:56:04,907
I must speak.

574
00:56:58,794 --> 00:57:00,254
Why all this?

575
00:57:01,338 --> 00:57:03,882
I want us to get married.

576
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:08,929
- We are already married.
- No one knows.

577
00:57:08,971 --> 00:57:10,639
It would settle everything.

578
00:57:11,974 --> 00:57:14,309
You should have all the money
you want.

579
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:15,853
I have no other family.

580
00:57:17,271 --> 00:57:19,314
Hope inherit after death.

581
00:57:24,027 --> 00:57:25,404
And your little lady?

582
00:57:26,572 --> 00:57:28,615
It has nothing to do with it.

583
00:57:29,658 --> 00:57:33,162
- You did not marry?
- I was already married.

584
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:38,792
It would be a family again.

585
00:57:38,834 --> 00:57:40,419
I served as his father.

586
00:57:44,214 --> 00:57:45,465
On one condition.

587
00:57:49,928 --> 00:57:51,930
I do not want her to know.

588
00:57:57,394 --> 00:57:59,688
It was not me who would tell him.

589
00:58:03,484 --> 00:58:04,651
We agree?

590
00:58:09,948 --> 00:58:11,200
Okay.

591
00:58:16,413 --> 00:58:17,998
How can you marry him?

592
00:58:24,713 --> 00:58:26,215
I do not understand.

593
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:32,721
They were never married.

594
00:58:33,764 --> 00:58:36,058
It does not explain
why marry you.

595
00:58:43,941 --> 00:58:45,776
I knew before.

596
00:58:48,403 --> 00:58:49,738
Before Dad?

597
00:58:52,658 --> 00:58:54,117
Before Dad.

598
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,007
Hey, guys!

599
00:59:15,138 --> 00:59:16,765
Engineers are back!

600
00:59:20,727 --> 00:59:22,855
Come on, hurry up.

601
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:24,106
I hurry.

602
00:59:24,148 --> 00:59:26,441
Hi, Dalglish.

603
00:59:26,441 --> 00:59:28,110
We are waiting for you, you know.

604
00:59:29,153 --> 00:59:31,238
Where is everyone?

605
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,115
At the wedding.

606
00:59:33,157 --> 00:59:34,825
Why not you?

607
00:59:34,867 --> 00:59:38,287
It is the marriage of Mr.
Dillon and Mrs. Burn.

608
00:59:38,328 --> 00:59:40,455
Forward, guys!

609
00:59:58,557 --> 00:59:59,975
I want you to be happy.

610
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:02,686
I am.

611
01:00:02,728 --> 01:00:04,271
- Are you well?
- Yes.

612
01:00:05,272 --> 01:00:06,273
How are you?

613
01:00:08,859 --> 01:00:09,943
Take care of it.

614
01:00:11,487 --> 01:00:13,739
- Bellanger, just dance.
- I arrive.

615
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,449
Excuse me, ma'am.
Excuse me.

616
01:00:19,495 --> 01:00:20,454
Hello, miss Burn.

617
01:00:21,663 --> 01:00:22,915
Good morning.

618
01:00:22,956 --> 01:00:24,833
- How are you?
- Want to dance?

619
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:26,210
With pleasure.

620
01:00:35,052 --> 01:00:36,887
How did it go?

621
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:38,263
All right.

622
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:43,185
It starts quickly.

623
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:16,048
Kingdom Come needs
a railroad.

624
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:18,050
Everyone needs it.

625
01:01:18,092 --> 01:01:20,427
The nation needs it.

626
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:23,848
Hope everything will be in one day.
Think about it.

627
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:26,308
I do not want, Mr. Dillon.

628
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:29,228
It is up to you,
whether you like it or not.

629
01:01:29,228 --> 01:01:30,229
Now ...

630
01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:32,356
you dance with me?

631
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:52,960
- Sorry.
- How are you?

632
01:01:53,002 --> 01:01:54,003
Yes.

633
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:08,851
Now I want
a beautiful wedding photo.

634
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:11,812
Stand up
in front of the camera.

635
01:02:11,854 --> 01:02:14,148
- I sit here?
- Yes, please.

636
01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:20,196
Maybe the bride
should sit?

637
01:02:22,031 --> 01:02:23,324
The bride ...

638
01:02:23,365 --> 01:02:24,366
Yes.

639
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:55,356
- Do you love me?
- Yes.

640
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:58,108
- Really?
- Of course.

641
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:59,819
You do not amuse me?

642
01:03:43,779 --> 01:03:46,115
I have to leave tomorrow.

643
01:03:46,157 --> 01:03:47,158
Already?

644
01:03:49,118 --> 01:03:51,620
Yes, we must
examine the other side.

645
01:03:51,662 --> 01:03:52,913
But I shall return.

646
01:03:54,832 --> 01:03:55,833
When?

647
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:57,543
Soon.

648
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:04,925
Does Dillon will
have what he wants?

649
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:08,679
I do not know.

650
01:04:11,015 --> 01:04:12,600
Everything would change.

651
01:04:12,641 --> 01:04:14,101
For the better.

652
01:04:14,143 --> 01:04:16,270
There will be a school, church.

653
01:04:16,312 --> 01:04:17,813
Even the sidewalks?

654
01:04:21,025 --> 01:04:22,651
Ilfaudra rename it.

655
01:04:23,694 --> 01:04:26,113
Dillonville, probably.

656
01:04:26,155 --> 01:04:28,324
Dillonopolis or Dilladelfia.

657
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:30,326
There are so many possibilities.

658
01:04:34,705 --> 01:04:37,374
Hope is a nice
name for a city.

659
01:04:43,422 --> 01:04:46,258
You build the road
iron to the Atlantic?

660
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,052
It is already there.

661
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:49,970
We will meet
in the middle.

662
01:04:54,517 --> 01:04:56,227
It's not that far, then.

663
01:05:03,776 --> 01:05:06,987
- Come, we are in the saloon.
- No, I'm too tired.

664
01:05:07,029 --> 01:05:09,323
- We got engaged.
- Really?

665
01:05:09,365 --> 01:05:10,449
You are engaged?

666
01:05:10,491 --> 01:05:12,952
- Yes, we celebrate.
- Come, both of them.

667
01:05:12,993 --> 01:05:16,747
I promised my mother
to help. But, thank you.

668
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:19,708
Come, Bellanger.
I want to tell Sue.

669
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,544
You must come.

670
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:24,046
- Okay.
- Congratulations.

671
01:05:28,384 --> 01:05:30,427
You're sure not to come?

672
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:33,681
I would like
but I can not.

673
01:05:33,722 --> 01:05:35,808
Just a drink.

674
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:38,352
I really
go help my mother.

675
01:05:39,353 --> 01:05:40,354
I understand.

676
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:55,202
Okay, okay, it's good.

677
01:05:55,244 --> 01:05:57,872
In honor of the engagement
Mr. Bellanger ...

678
01:05:57,913 --> 01:06:00,958
and a certain lady
of the parish,

679
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,295
Railway Company
Central Pacific ...

680
01:06:04,336 --> 01:06:05,796
pays the tour!

681
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:12,344
And some
amount of tobacco.

682
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,028
- I'll go see Sue.
- Go ahead, darling.

683
01:06:35,242 --> 01:06:37,077
Hi, bitch.

684
01:06:37,077 --> 01:06:39,497
Do not be sad, Sue.

685
01:06:39,538 --> 01:06:41,207
You're gonna make me cry.

686
01:06:53,427 --> 01:06:55,054
You look lost, Lochinvar.

687
01:06:56,764 --> 01:06:59,600
- You do not want a girl?
- Not tonight.

688
01:07:07,775 --> 01:07:09,109
You bring me back home?

689
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:13,447
Impossible. I have a big
day, tomorrow.

690
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:16,659
You're so polite.

691
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,035
I like it.

692
01:08:15,426 --> 01:08:16,760
It hurts?

693
01:08:42,995 --> 01:08:44,914
Our equipment
is at the warehouse.

694
01:08:44,955 --> 01:08:48,417
- Send us an invoice.
- It will be free.

695
01:08:48,459 --> 01:08:50,419
We will pay
what seems right.

696
01:08:50,461 --> 01:08:53,088
If you do not build,
do not come back.

697
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:30,292
- Thank you.
- I bring you something?

698
01:09:31,293 --> 01:09:32,294
No, thank you.

699
01:09:33,879 --> 01:09:35,339
Look at the piano.

700
01:09:43,222 --> 01:09:44,598
Dillon offered to you?

701
01:09:58,112 --> 01:10:02,366
The man, now
identified and isolated the power ...

702
01:10:02,408 --> 01:10:05,536
which is originally
of life and had galvanized.

703
01:10:05,578 --> 01:10:08,414
This force is electricity.

704
01:10:08,414 --> 01:10:09,748
Look.

705
01:10:09,748 --> 01:10:11,375
The frog ...

706
01:10:11,417 --> 01:10:12,626
is dead.

707
01:10:12,668 --> 01:10:16,380
But if we introduce a
small electric shock ...

708
01:10:16,422 --> 01:10:17,840
in the frog,

709
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,760
and ...

710
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,143
Of course, it's too late ...

711
01:10:29,185 --> 01:10:31,479
forces to revive the ...

712
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,523
This poor frog
a sustainable manner.

713
01:10:34,565 --> 01:10:35,566
Excuse me.

714
01:10:36,609 --> 01:10:41,322
But the sound absorption
electricity ...

715
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:43,866
for a disease can ...

716
01:10:43,908 --> 01:10:47,536
revitalizing forces
life of an individual ...

717
01:10:47,578 --> 01:10:50,539
and strengthen the will to live.

718
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:54,001
Take them, yes.

719
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,171
Do not be afraid.

720
01:10:57,213 --> 01:11:00,299
This equipment generates
a small electric shock.

721
01:11:05,763 --> 01:11:06,764
Did you notice?

722
01:13:13,307 --> 01:13:15,142
It's narrow.

723
01:13:15,184 --> 01:13:16,852
Was constructed
in worse conditions.

724
01:13:18,437 --> 01:13:19,438
It's expensive.

725
01:13:20,231 --> 01:13:22,858
$ 50,000 per km,
perhaps 40,000.

726
01:13:26,153 --> 01:13:30,407
And this city, Kingdom Come?

727
01:13:30,407 --> 01:13:31,909
What will happen to him?

728
01:13:35,454 --> 01:13:37,414
They can move,
Sir.

729
01:13:38,874 --> 01:13:41,001
We will give you trouble?

730
01:13:42,169 --> 01:13:43,712
I guess yes.

731
01:13:45,422 --> 01:13:48,133
- Do what you must do.
- Yes, sir.

732
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:55,891
Do not try to get
one day of work without token.

733
01:13:55,933 --> 01:13:57,059
All right, guys.

734
01:13:58,561 --> 01:13:59,562
And that's it.

735
01:14:12,449 --> 01:14:13,826
Water, please.

736
01:14:25,296 --> 01:14:27,298
Let's remove him his nightshirt.

737
01:14:41,312 --> 01:14:42,521
Raises his arms.

738
01:14:49,445 --> 01:14:50,779
Thank you, Mr. Dillon.

739
01:14:52,364 --> 01:14:53,324
Thank you.

740
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:35,551
Good morning.

741
01:16:37,219 --> 01:16:40,723
Can you give me some herbs
like last time?

742
01:16:46,353 --> 01:16:48,022
Do not lose the head, Bellanger.

743
01:16:49,356 --> 01:16:51,025
We do not want the fight.

744
01:16:57,865 --> 01:17:01,076
Can you give me
a little more of it?

745
01:17:32,149 --> 01:17:35,444
If you walk a little,
it will pass.

746
01:17:35,486 --> 01:17:38,113
The engineering team
is going to pack.

747
01:17:39,782 --> 01:17:40,866
I'm coming.

748
01:17:46,497 --> 01:17:48,749
The current needs
time to circulate.

749
01:18:04,348 --> 01:18:05,641
Dan?

750
01:18:49,435 --> 01:18:50,936
You are leaving us, Dalglish ...

751
01:18:51,979 --> 01:18:55,107
or the railway
will go through my corral?

752
01:18:55,149 --> 01:18:57,109
No, it does not.

753
01:18:57,109 --> 01:18:58,611
Where is it?

754
01:18:58,611 --> 01:19:01,071
It will aufond Valley.

755
01:19:01,113 --> 01:19:04,825
Aufond Valley?
It's far from my city.

756
01:19:04,867 --> 01:19:07,828
Yes, but the land there
belongs to no one.

757
01:19:07,870 --> 01:19:10,206
- The railway ...
- You got me wrong.

758
01:19:11,457 --> 01:19:12,625
Why are you back?

759
01:19:14,043 --> 01:19:16,462
We must recover
the material of the company.

760
01:19:20,841 --> 01:19:22,718
Mr. Sweetley ...

761
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:25,679
these men are
weapons in our city.

762
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:28,307
We have spent
the limits of Kingdom Come.

763
01:19:28,349 --> 01:19:30,768
I decide
the limits of my town.

764
01:19:38,359 --> 01:19:39,610
Go to the home.

765
01:19:43,989 --> 01:19:45,449
Do not move, Mr. Dillon!

766
01:19:46,534 --> 01:19:48,410
There is no
other injuries.

767
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:55,626
Sorry for M. Sweetley.

768
01:19:58,921 --> 01:20:01,507
We pack and leave
as soon as possible.

769
01:20:06,512 --> 01:20:07,888
You have until dawn.

770
01:20:10,266 --> 01:20:12,726
Take him to the sheriff.

771
01:20:12,768 --> 01:20:14,019
Take off your hat.

772
01:20:22,736 --> 01:20:23,904
Lower arms.

773
01:20:23,946 --> 01:20:25,364
At work.

774
01:20:27,449 --> 01:20:29,076
Come on, faster.

775
01:20:56,979 --> 01:20:58,063
Let's go.

776
01:21:32,097 --> 01:21:33,098
What happened?

777
01:21:34,892 --> 01:21:36,811
Sweetley died.

778
01:21:36,852 --> 01:21:38,020
Dalglish was killed.

779
01:21:40,606 --> 01:21:41,607
Come here.

780
01:21:43,234 --> 01:21:44,193
Come.

781
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:08,717
Sometimes you turn
back to someone ...

782
01:22:08,759 --> 01:22:12,221
and when you look
again, your life is gone.

783
01:22:17,351 --> 01:22:18,769
Do not stay here.

784
01:22:20,104 --> 01:22:21,772
Do not stay for me.

785
01:22:36,579 --> 01:22:39,039
No one rejoices, Lucy.

786
01:22:43,002 --> 01:22:45,129
Hey!

787
01:22:45,171 --> 01:22:46,922
Francisco, where Bellanger?

788
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:53,471
Gentlemen! Come!

789
01:22:53,512 --> 01:22:55,306
Come on, girls. Will.

790
01:23:05,232 --> 01:23:07,318
It is on the house tonight.

791
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:10,321
Do not sit as
a band of virgins.

792
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:15,367
It did not. Will.

793
01:23:17,286 --> 01:23:19,330
You pay, you pay!

794
01:23:19,371 --> 01:23:20,873
Do not go, Bellanger.

795
01:23:27,254 --> 01:23:28,923
Please, do not go.

796
01:24:00,955 --> 01:24:02,206
I'll miss you.

797
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:05,042
Come with us.

798
01:24:06,544 --> 01:24:07,920
You can build a city.

799
01:24:14,051 --> 01:24:15,094
What do you mean?

800
01:24:16,345 --> 01:24:18,222
Why not?

801
01:24:18,264 --> 01:24:21,350
Are you recording land, you
organized money. You can.

802
01:24:24,145 --> 01:24:26,689
- You would do very well.
- Yes, I could.

803
01:24:30,192 --> 01:24:31,152
Really?

804
01:24:49,336 --> 01:24:50,504
She is dying.

805
01:24:51,630 --> 01:24:54,300
If you go,
you never see her again.

806
01:25:45,184 --> 01:25:46,519
What's going on?

807
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:49,522
- Where is he?
- Who?

808
01:25:49,563 --> 01:25:50,898
Where Dalglish?

809
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:52,441
Answer when I get off the woman.

810
01:25:52,483 --> 01:25:54,276
At Lucia!

811
01:26:03,619 --> 01:26:05,246
- Go away!
- Go, go!

812
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:16,173
I told you to go away!
I'll kill you.

813
01:26:20,469 --> 01:26:21,637
Going on.

814
01:26:23,013 --> 01:26:26,350
What are you doing here? Your wife
await you and your daughter.

815
01:26:30,146 --> 01:26:31,814
Hope your daughter, right?

816
01:26:50,583 --> 01:26:51,584
How are you?

817
01:26:59,425 --> 01:27:01,760
- Where are you?
- On vacation.

818
01:27:01,802 --> 01:27:04,889
Why? Wait!
What's going on?

819
01:27:04,930 --> 01:27:07,266
- What do you mean you go?
- C'estfermי.

820
01:27:07,266 --> 01:27:10,561
- Just you and me, then.
- What, you and me?

821
01:27:10,603 --> 01:27:13,439
It is so hard that
I could prick coal.

822
01:27:13,481 --> 01:27:17,318
Ilfaudra do that by hand.
Sit a little cream.

823
01:27:17,359 --> 01:27:18,903
I for two minutes.

824
01:27:18,944 --> 01:27:21,572
Sue was found
something to you!

825
01:27:23,782 --> 01:27:26,035
It is precisely
what we need.

826
01:27:52,353 --> 01:27:55,856
The tobacco shop and saloon
will close today.

827
01:27:55,898 --> 01:27:58,400
We will
installed in the valley.

828
01:27:59,485 --> 01:28:02,363
There will nifemmes,
or alcohol to Kingdom Come ...

829
01:28:02,404 --> 01:28:03,989
From now on.

830
01:28:04,031 --> 01:28:06,659
If you want women
tobacco and alcohol,

831
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:08,160
you know where to find them.

832
01:28:08,202 --> 01:28:10,871
If you want to stay,
God bless you.

833
01:28:26,053 --> 01:28:28,931
You will find our camp
in the valley.

834
01:28:28,973 --> 01:28:31,517
We will take
of you there.

835
01:28:31,559 --> 01:28:33,310
Okay.

836
01:28:33,352 --> 01:28:35,563
Do not forget us.

837
01:28:35,604 --> 01:28:37,398
We will not forget you.

838
01:28:42,444 --> 01:28:43,863
See you there.

839
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:00,796
Do not forget me

840
01:29:02,465 --> 01:29:05,593
Do not trouble

841
01:29:07,344 --> 01:29:11,015
Because my heart is sincere

842
01:29:12,183 --> 01:29:14,977
And can not disappoint you

843
01:29:16,479 --> 01:29:19,607
My hand and my heart

844
01:29:20,649 --> 01:29:23,486
I give them

845
01:29:25,821 --> 01:29:27,781
See you after all this?

846
01:29:32,244 --> 01:29:35,831
The next time you see me
you do not talk to me.

847
01:29:36,832 --> 01:29:38,334
Why?

848
01:29:38,334 --> 01:29:41,337
You'll be the woman most
rich north of Sacramento ...

849
01:29:41,337 --> 01:29:43,672
and I'm an engineer
of railways.

850
01:29:45,341 --> 01:29:48,302
You would not stay
to build a city?

851
01:29:48,344 --> 01:29:51,388
It is a railway
I want to build.

852
01:29:54,892 --> 01:29:57,561
You would stay if someone
you asked.

853
01:29:58,562 --> 01:30:00,439
- Who?
- Hope.

854
01:30:11,909 --> 01:30:13,869
You have a name for your city?

855
01:30:16,038 --> 01:30:18,707
I want to name it
after my father.

856
01:30:20,084 --> 01:30:22,127
I've always dreamed
to return there.

857
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:25,339
He pronounced it so well.

858
01:30:30,136 --> 01:30:32,138
Here
I belong now.

859
01:30:34,974 --> 01:30:36,267
And you, Dalglish?

860
01:30:37,268 --> 01:30:39,603
You would not
belong to one place?

861
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:44,400
Yes

862
01:30:47,027 --> 01:30:48,696
When I finished
the railway.

863
01:30:55,161 --> 01:30:56,620
Farewell.

864
01:30:56,662 --> 01:30:58,122
Farewell, Dalglish.

865
01:31:08,174 --> 01:31:09,758
Return to work.

866
01:31:22,229 --> 01:31:23,939
I would
she is my daughter.

867
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:30,029
So you do it
tell the truth.

868
01:32:41,809 --> 01:32:44,228
What's going on? Tell me.

869
01:32:45,062 --> 01:32:46,689
Come.

870
01:32:46,730 --> 01:32:48,232
It's going to go, it will go.

871
01:33:03,581 --> 01:33:05,374
Let me give you water.

872
01:33:05,416 --> 01:33:07,626
Wood as much as you can.

873
01:33:07,668 --> 01:33:08,878
Bois.

874
01:33:11,213 --> 01:33:13,841
You have to keep drinking.
I beg you.

875
01:33:15,050 --> 01:33:17,344
Please, wood.
Wood, please.

876
01:33:27,271 --> 01:33:30,107
You'll feel better in a minute.
It's going to go.

877
01:33:36,197 --> 01:33:37,198
Look at me.

878
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:26,325
TELEGRAMS

879
01:36:26,367 --> 01:36:27,993
You will work this afternoon ...

880
01:36:53,561 --> 01:36:57,022
Weapons are prohibited
in my city.

881
01:36:57,064 --> 01:36:59,525
I came for a priest.

882
01:36:59,567 --> 01:37:02,611
- Why do you need?
- Elena died.

883
01:37:48,866 --> 01:37:50,326
Where are you?

884
01:37:50,367 --> 01:37:51,368
I'm going.

885
01:37:55,164 --> 01:37:56,790
I'll get Dalglish.

886
01:38:00,002 --> 01:38:04,089
She told me not to
abandon those you love,

887
01:38:04,131 --> 01:38:05,800
no matter what they do.

888
01:38:08,677 --> 01:38:09,678
Farewell.

889
01:38:12,556 --> 01:38:14,016
I would like to show you
something.

890
01:38:15,893 --> 01:38:17,520
You come with me?

891
01:38:23,526 --> 01:38:25,903
Wait for me here,
please.

892
01:38:25,945 --> 01:38:26,987
I will be here.

893
01:38:29,448 --> 01:38:30,449
And there.

894
01:39:22,084 --> 01:39:23,085
Who is it?

895
01:39:25,379 --> 01:39:26,714
You know who it is.

896
01:39:31,010 --> 01:39:32,011
It's you.

897
01:39:37,349 --> 01:39:38,642
The baby is you.

898
01:39:40,436 --> 01:39:42,104
The woman is your mother.

899
01:39:53,449 --> 01:39:54,533
I do not understand.

900
01:39:56,702 --> 01:39:57,828
I have sold.

901
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:02,333
I sold your mother.

902
01:40:05,753 --> 01:40:08,547
I have sold
Burn in against gold ...

903
01:40:11,842 --> 01:40:13,844
here in this hut.

904
01:41:00,307 --> 01:41:02,434
Welcome, Mr. Dalglish.

905
01:41:02,476 --> 01:41:05,479
- It's nice to see you.
- Bellanger Here!

906
01:41:06,689 --> 01:41:07,898
Here it is.

907
01:41:19,493 --> 01:41:21,245
Where is the priest?

908
01:41:21,287 --> 01:41:23,789
- He is not here.
- Why?

909
01:41:23,831 --> 01:41:26,750
- He went to Kingdom Come.
- Why?

910
01:41:28,669 --> 01:41:30,671
Dillon died.

911
01:41:32,631 --> 01:41:36,010
- He went to bury him.
- It will come back?

912
01:41:36,051 --> 01:41:37,887
I hope so.

913
01:41:37,928 --> 01:41:41,515
Come see the church.
It is not over yet.

914
01:41:41,557 --> 01:41:42,516
Friends ...

915
01:41:44,602 --> 01:41:48,189
we are gathered to see
the beginning of an era ...

916
01:41:48,230 --> 01:41:50,983
and the beginning
a new city.

917
01:41:53,819 --> 01:41:57,448
In many years,
when you tell the story ...

918
01:41:57,490 --> 01:41:59,658
men and women
North America ...

919
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:03,329
who conquered this territory
blank with steel strings,

920
01:42:03,370 --> 01:42:06,248
you can say that
you played your role.

921
01:42:11,587 --> 01:42:13,464
And on behalf ...

922
01:42:13,506 --> 01:42:15,883
the railway
Central Pacific,

923
01:42:15,925 --> 01:42:20,346
I wish you happiness
and prosperity ...

924
01:42:20,387 --> 01:42:22,264
in your new city ...

925
01:42:23,098 --> 01:42:24,517
Lisbon.

926
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:56,025
Here the priest.

927
01:43:56,066 --> 01:43:57,443
Miss Burn it.

928
01:43:59,195 --> 01:44:00,404
I come back.

929
01:44:21,258 --> 01:44:22,593
Let me help you.

930
01:44:26,764 --> 01:44:27,765
Thank you.

931
01:44:31,685 --> 01:44:34,021
Miss Burn, I
sorry for your loss.

932
01:44:36,106 --> 01:44:38,108
She was sick
for a long time.

933
01:44:41,904 --> 01:44:43,113
I have done wrong.

934
01:44:44,490 --> 01:44:47,159
When one is left
not in one place

935
01:44:47,159 --> 01:44:50,788
it behaves differently
in other circumstances.

936
01:44:52,581 --> 01:44:55,501
It is unfortunate that
circumstances have been.

937
01:45:03,050 --> 01:45:04,677
I would like to attend the wedding.

938
01:45:08,097 --> 01:45:10,683
Yes, of course.

939
01:45:10,724 --> 01:45:12,017
Thank you.

940
01:46:52,243 --> 01:46:53,577
You are etfemme husband.

941
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:57,873
Embrace it, Annie!

942
01:47:08,843 --> 01:47:10,719
Annie, are you working tonight?

943
01:47:15,349 --> 01:47:16,392
Aufeu!

944
01:47:17,143 --> 01:47:20,229
Alan! Alan, saddle the horses!

945
01:47:34,451 --> 01:47:36,245
Kingdom Come is burning!

946
01:47:37,788 --> 01:47:39,373
- Horses!
- I gotta go.

947
01:47:39,415 --> 01:47:42,001
- I bring the horses.
- John! Robert!

948
01:48:42,978 --> 01:48:44,605
It's too hot!

949
01:48:46,732 --> 01:48:48,567
Be careful, guys.

950
01:48:52,822 --> 01:48:54,406
Come back, come back!

951
01:48:54,448 --> 01:48:55,908
We lost!

952
01:49:06,127 --> 01:49:07,920
Come on, guys!

953
01:49:24,103 --> 01:49:26,438
- Have you found?
- No.

954
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:28,315
We start again at dawn.

955
01:50:47,019 --> 01:50:48,312
What is it?

956
01:51:08,499 --> 01:51:09,834
Father, wake up,
I beg you.

957
01:51:11,502 --> 01:51:12,795
Please, wake up.

958
01:51:34,358 --> 01:51:35,985
You can help me return it?

959
01:51:37,486 --> 01:51:38,445
Bring the horses.

960
01:51:47,121 --> 01:51:49,582
Help me to return.

961
01:52:56,106 --> 01:52:58,359
Stop the horse. Stop!

962
01:52:58,400 --> 01:52:59,401
Please.

963
01:53:01,237 --> 01:53:02,279
Daniel?

964
01:53:58,210 --> 01:53:59,503
They were like kings.

965
01:54:03,257 --> 01:54:05,593
- Who?
- Pioneers.

966
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:08,053
Men like Dillon.

967
01:54:09,638 --> 01:54:12,099
They came here
when there was nothing

968
01:54:12,141 --> 01:54:15,603
they built these cities
and have reigned as kings.

969
01:54:20,024 --> 01:54:21,025
gold!

970
01:54:26,238 --> 01:54:28,908
Let's go get it! At the bank!

971
01:54:28,949 --> 01:54:31,410
- Quick!
- It's ours now!

972
01:54:32,305 --> 01:55:32,808
