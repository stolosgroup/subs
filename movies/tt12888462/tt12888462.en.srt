<i>A lot of people say</i>
<i>that an octopus is like an alien.</i>

3
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,560
<i>But the strange thing is,</i>
<i>as you get closer to them,</i>

4
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,760
<i>you realize that we're very similar</i>
<i>in a lot of ways.</i>

5
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,200
<i>You're stepping</i>
<i>into this completely different world.</i>

6
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,560
<i>Such an incredible feeling.</i>

7
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,680
<i>And you feel you're on the brink</i>
<i>of something extraordinary.</i>

8
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,800
<i>But you realize</i>
<i>that there's a line that can't be crossed.</i>

9
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,720
<i>It's quite a long time ago now,</i>
<i>that day when it all started.</i>

10
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,360
<i>This place on the tip of Africa</i>
<i>is known as the Cape of Storms.</i>

11
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,080
<i>My childhood memories</i>
<i>are completely dominated</i>

12
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,240
<i>by the rocky shore, the intertidal</i>
<i>and the kelp forest.</i>

13
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,240
<i>We had this little wooden bungalow,</i>

14
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,000
<i>literally below the high-water mark.</i>

15
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,960
<i>So when those huge storms</i>
<i>used to come in,</i>

16
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,600
<i>the ocean used to smash the doors down</i>
<i>and fill up the bottom of the house.</i>

17
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
<i>So it was incredibly exciting as a child</i>

18
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,400
<i>to literally live</i>
<i>in the force of that giant Atlantic Ocean.</i>

19
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,520
<i>Most of my childhood</i>
<i>was spent in the rock pools,</i>

20
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,480
<i>diving in the shallow kelp forest.</i>

21
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,360
<i>That's what I most loved to do.</i>

22
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,960
<i>As an adult, I'd been separated from that.</i>

23
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,720
<i>And that was fine at first.</i>

24
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,880
<i>Until I went to the central Kalahari</i>
<i>about 20 years ago.</i>

25
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,240
<i>I was making a film</i>
<i>called</i> The Great Dance <i>with my brother.</i>

26
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,960
<i>And then I met these men</i>

27
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,400
<i>who were probably</i>
<i>some of the best trackers in the world.</i>

28
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,520
<i>To watch these men...</i>

29
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,959
<i>go into the incredible,</i>
<i>subtle signs in nature,</i>

30
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,560
<i>things that my eye couldn't even see,</i>

31
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,520
<i>and then follow them, sometimes for hours,</i>

32
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,960
<i>and find hidden animals in the landscape</i>

33
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,400
<i>was just extraordinary to witness.</i>

34
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,880
<i>I mean, they just were</i>
<i>inside of the natural world.</i>

35
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,680
<i>And I could feel I was outside.</i>

36
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,400
<i>And I had this deep longing</i>
<i>to be inside that world.</i>

37
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,720
<i>I went through two years of absolute hell.</i>

38
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,520
<i>I had been working hard for a long time,</i>

39
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,720
<i>I'd just worn myself out.</i>

40
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,680
<i>I hadn't slept properly for months.</i>

41
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,160
<i>My family was suffering.</i>

42
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,200
<i>And I was getting sick</i>
<i>from all the pressure.</i>

43
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,920
<i>My mind couldn't deal with all that stuff.</i>

44
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,960
<i>And I didn't wanna see a camera</i>
<i>or an edit suite ever again.</i>

45
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,880
<i>I couldn't even face that.</i>

46
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,400
<i>Your great purpose in life is now...</i>

47
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,880
<i>just in pieces.</i>

48
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,640
<i>And you've got this young child</i>
<i>that's growing up.</i>

49
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,520
<i>Tom.</i>

50
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,520
I just couldn't, in that state,
be a good father to my son.

51
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,640
<i>I had to have a radical change.</i>

52
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,600
And I took inspiration from my childhood,

53
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,080
and I took inspiration
from these master trackers

54
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,680
I worked with in the Kalahari.

55
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,960
And the only way I knew
how to do it was to...

56
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,640
be in this ocean.

57
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,360
<i>In the beginning,</i>
<i>it's a hard thing to get in the water.</i>

58
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,200
<i>It's one of the wildest, most scary places</i>
<i>to swim on the planet.</i>

59
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,880
<i>The water drops to as low</i>
<i>as eight, nine degrees Celsius.</i>

60
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,600
<i>The cold takes your breath away.</i>

61
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,000
<i>And you just have to relax.</i>

62
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,160
<i>And then you'll get</i>
<i>this beautiful window of time</i>

63
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,840
<i>for 10, 15 minutes.</i>

64
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,320
<i>Suddenly...</i>

65
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,160
<i>everything feels okay.</i>

66
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:39,240
<i>The cold upgrades the brain because</i>
<i>you're getting this flood of chemicals</i>

67
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,480
<i>every time you immerse in that cold water.</i>

68
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,040
<i>Your whole body comes alive.</i>

69
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,320
<i>And then, as your body adapts,</i>
<i>it just becomes easier and easier.</i>

70
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,400
<i>And eventually...</i>

71
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,040
<i>after about a year...</i>

72
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,280
<i>you start to crave the cold.</i>

73
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,640
<i>What's so amazing about this environment</i>

74
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,000
<i>is you're in a three-dimensional forest,</i>

75
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,760
<i>and you can jump off the top</i>
<i>and go wherever you want.</i>

76
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,640
<i>You're flying, basically.</i>

77
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,799
<i>You might as well be on another planet.</i>

78
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,640
<i>You naturally just get</i>
<i>more relaxed in the water.</i>

79
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,120
<i>You get to be able</i>
<i>to hold your breath for longer.</i>

80
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,800
<i>Having a scuba tank in a thick kelp forest</i>

81
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,160
<i>is not optimal for me.</i>

82
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,000
<i>I want to be more like</i>
<i>an amphibious animal.</i>

83
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,000
<i>Instinctively,</i>
<i>I knew not to wear a wet suit.</i>

84
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,440
<i>If you really wanna get close to...</i>

85
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,520
<i>an environment like this,</i>

86
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,960
<i>it helps tremendously to have</i>
<i>no barrier to that environment.</i>

87
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,200
<i>And I suddenly realized I've got energy</i>
<i>to take images and film again...</i>

88
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,440
<i>and then picked up my camera again</i>

89
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,080
<i>and started doing the thing I love</i>
<i>and what I know.</i>

90
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,840
<i>The animals are extremely</i>
<i>exotic and strange.</i>

91
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,440
<i>It's, like, much more extreme</i>
<i>than our maddest science fiction.</i>

92
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
<i>I remember that day when it all started.</i>

93
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,400
<i>I found this very, very special area</i>

94
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,240
<i>that is protected</i>
<i>with a big piece of kelp forest,</i>

95
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,080
<i>'cause the forest itself</i>
<i>actually dampens the swell.</i>

96
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,760
And the whole forest around there

97
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,200
is absolutely murky,
and you can't see a thing.

98
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,120
And in this little 200-meter patch,
you can dive

99
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,280
and observe.

100
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,880
And it's an incredible place.

101
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,840
And I remember there was
this strange shape to my left

102
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,240
and just going down...

103
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,480
and seeing this really strange thing.

104
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,040
The fish even seemed to be confused.

105
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,400
And then, suddenly...

106
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,040
At the time, I didn't know

107
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,040
I'd witnessed something extraordinary.

108
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,880
I'd come in at the end of a whole drama.

109
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,440
You think,
"What on earth is this animal doing?"

110
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,680
And I think she was
a little bit afraid of me,

111
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,480
so she lifted this incredibly slippery...

112
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,120
piece of algae that you can hardly
hold with your hands

113
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,520
and just wrapped it
in this extraordinary cloak around her

114
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,800
and then stared at me
out of the little gap.

115
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,920
And then, boom, you know, she was gone.

116
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,800
It's a hard thing to explain,

117
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,480
but sometimes you just get a feeling,

118
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,200
and you know

119
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,080
there's-- there's something
to this creature that's very unusual.

120
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,800
There's something to learn here.

121
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,000
There's something special about her.

122
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,400
And then I had this crazy idea.

123
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,280
What happens if I just went every day?

124
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,720
What happens if I... I never missed a day?

125
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,280
And, initially, she was clearly
being affected by my presence,

126
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,480
so I thought,
"I'll leave the camera there,

127
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,000
and then that will record her
going about her business."

128
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,320
She sees this shiny new thing
in the forest.

129
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,520
Coming at it with a shield,

130
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,840
just in case it attacked,
and put up the shield.

131
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,480
<i>This is something different.</i>
<i>This is interesting.</i>

132
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,600
<i>Touching it, feeling it, tasting it.</i>

133
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,560
<i>If she was in a playful mood,</i>
<i>you couldn't leave it there for too long.</i>

134
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,520
<i>She'd just pull the thing over.</i>

135
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,680
<i>It took going in every day to really</i>
<i>get to know her environment better.</i>

136
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,640
<i>Initially, it all just seems</i>
<i>like much of the same thing.</i>

137
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,280
<i>But then, after a while, you see</i>
<i>all the different types of the forest.</i>

138
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,200
<i>You get the old-growth forest.</i>

139
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,200
<i>You get the forest with a lot</i>
<i>of different algae growing in the bottom.</i>

140
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,760
<i>You get the misty forest.</i>

141
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,880
<i>As I started to map</i>
<i>the environment around her den,</i>

142
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,960
<i>it was shocking to see small caves</i>
<i>really close to her,</i>

143
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,840
<i>packed with pyjama sharks.</i>

144
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,200
<i>And they really are</i>
<i>her most serious predator.</i>

145
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,080
<i>Their skin is striped.</i>
<i>That's why they're called a pyjama shark.</i>

146
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,360
<i>They're not visual predators.</i>

147
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,000
<i>But they have</i>
<i>an incredible sense of smell.</i>

148
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,280
<i>And they are particularly aggressive.</i>

149
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,520
<i>They can shove their noses</i>
<i>into a small crack.</i>

150
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,000
<i>So they are</i>
<i>deadly little octopus predators.</i>

151
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,160
<i>And I was thinking, "Well, how long before</i>
<i>something happens with these animals?"</i>

152
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,800
After visiting her more and more and more,

153
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,880
there was a definite moment where...

154
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,280
that fear had subsided tremendously.

155
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,400
She'd see big movement,

156
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,000
and she'd be slightly afraid
and then look, "Oh, it's him."

157
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,600
And she'd come out and be very curious.

158
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,600
Very interested, very curious,
but not taking stupid chances.

159
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,880
Keeping all the other arms
attached to the den

160
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,280
and the suckers in place.

161
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,040
And then it just happens.

162
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,240
I put my hand out a tiny bit.

163
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,480
Something happens
when that animal makes contact.

164
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,960
But, at some point,
you're gonna have to breathe.

165
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,120
So you've got to very gently

166
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,320
prize off those suckers

167
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
without disturbing her,

168
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,320
so that you can actually
go up and take a breath.

169
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,600
By far the most powerful

170
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,280
is when it comes out the den

171
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,760
because that's when you know
there's full trust.

172
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,760
There's no holding the arms back
just in case I have to pull back.

173
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,800
It's like, "I totally trust this human,

174
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,160
and I'm coming out of the den,

175
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,080
and I'm gonna go about my business."

176
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,440
I started to see
pretty extraordinary things.

177
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,320
They can look spiky. They can look smooth.

178
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,760
Grow horns on their heads.

179
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,400
They can match color,
texture, pattern, skin.

180
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's beautiful.

181
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,080
Most of the time, she's jetting
or crawling or swimming.

182
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,040
But occasionally,

183
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,360
two legs come out.

184
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,520
She walks.

185
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,520
And off she goes, striding away,

186
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,800
walking bipedally.

187
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,680
She puts her body into this strange
posture that kind of looks like a rock.

188
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,840
And then two of those arms underneath
slowly moving,

189
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,960
so the rock is just slowly moving away.

190
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,480
And then she changes

191
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,520
into this extraordinary, wobbly,
flowy old lady in a dress.

192
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,240
Perhaps she's trying to mimic

193
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,120
kelp or algae moving in the swell...

194
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,120
and, at the same time,
is slowly moving away.

195
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,600
And this is how she works.

196
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,920
This incredible creativity to deceive.

197
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:34,720
An octopus is essentially a snail
that's lost its shell in evolution.

198
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,120
A very fragile, liquid, soft animal

199
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,640
that relies on tremendous intelligence.

200
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,160
She's got no mother or father
to teach her anything. She's alone.

201
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,880
'Cause you've got all these different
types of predators, all hunting her.

202
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,040
So, over millions of years,
she's had to...

203
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,480
come up with the most incredible methods
to deceive them.

204
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,360
And she's got to learn fast because

205
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,040
she's only got just over a year to live.

206
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,120
When you're diving alone,
everything about my kit has to be perfect.

207
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,240
And I've gotta be prepared
for all eventualities.

208
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,160
I can't be fiddling around.
It's gotta be instinctive.

209
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,560
But, at that point,
I was making a lot of mistakes.

210
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,120
One day, she was following me.

211
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,800
And that's the most incredible thing,
is to be followed by an octopus.

212
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,040
You know, you're just backing away,
moving backwards,

213
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,520
and this incredible animal
is coming towards you.

214
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,000
And there's not
a lot of fear in it at all.

215
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,720
It's curious, and there's trust,

216
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
and it's like this fantastic feeling.

217
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,320
And then, bam!

218
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,760
I dropped one of my lenses,

219
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,280
and that thing falling quickly
just startles that animal.

220
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,120
And then it turns and rushes,
and it's got a huge fright.

221
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,720
And you just... you wanna kick yourself,
because it's, you know...

222
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,480
That could have ended in the most
incredible interaction and deep trust,

223
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,880
and you've ruined it.

224
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,640
Now, you know, have you ruined it forever?

225
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,240
Uh, is that animal ever gonna trust you?

226
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,120
Has that... has that experience
freaked it out too much?

227
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,080
And then I approached her too fast.

228
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,520
And that's when she left the den
and got a real fright...

229
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,160
and didn't come back to that den.

230
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,320
And I thought this was over.

231
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,400
She was gone.

232
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,960
I'd had this experience
with these incredible San master trackers.

233
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,960
I just thought, "I wonder if anybody
could ever track anything underwater?"

234
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:56,640
This animal has spent millions of years
learning to be impossible to find.

235
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,840
I had to learn
what octopus tracks looked like.

236
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,400
And that was very frustrating at first,
so difficult to discern.

237
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,800
What's the difference
between octopus tracks

238
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,440
and heart urchin tracks

239
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,200
and fish tracks...

240
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,200
and worm tracks?

241
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,720
And the predation marks.

242
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,800
The egg casings.

243
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,080
I needed to learn everything.

244
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,200
And then you have to start thinking...

245
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,880
like an octopus.

246
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,720
<i>It's like being a detective.</i>

247
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,200
<i>And you just slowly</i>
<i>get all your clues together.</i>

248
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,920
<i>And then I started to...</i>

249
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,120
<i>make breakthroughs.</i>

250
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,280
<i>"Okay, those are the animals</i>
<i>she's killing."</i>

251
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,120
<i>So I'm looking at kills. I'm looking</i>
<i>at little marks, diggings in the sand,</i>

252
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,520
<i>little changes in the algal patterns</i>
<i>where she's been moving.</i>

253
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,920
<i>And then knowing,</i>
<i>"Okay, this animal is very close now.</i>

254
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,800
<i>It's close.</i>
<i>It's within one or two meters."</i>

255
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,760
<i>And then focusing on that small space.</i>

256
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,800
And then, bang!

257
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,960
She's there.

258
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,880
Finally, after looking for her
for a week, day after day,

259
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,960
there she was.

260
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,720
It's like a...

261
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,600
a human friend, like, waving
and saying, "Hi, I'm excited to see you."

262
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,160
And I could feel it,
like from one minute to the next,

263
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,440
"Okay, I trust you. I trust you, human.

264
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,040
And now you can come
into my octopus world."

265
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,480
And she's moving towards me.

266
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,280
And my natural instinct is...

267
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,120
to gently back away.

268
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,720
And then I just wanted to keep still,
so I held onto a rock.

269
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,680
She just kept coming...

270
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,800
and then covered my whole hand.

271
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,760
I'd been underwater
for quite a long time,

272
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,960
so I just gently pushed for the surface,
thinking she would move off my hand.

273
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,320
But she didn't. She just rode
on my hand right to the surface.

274
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,960
There I was, just staring into the eyes
of this incredible creature.

275
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,720
It was difficult to imagine at first

276
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,680
that she was getting anything
out of the relationship.

277
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,080
Why would a wild animal, doing its thing,

278
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,400
get anything out of this

279
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,480
strange human creature visiting?

280
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
<i>And this is where it gets interesting.</i>

281
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,160
<i>I think quite stimulating</i>
<i>for that huge intelligence.</i>

282
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,000
<i>Somehow, she realizes</i>
<i>this thing is not dangerous,</i>

283
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,680
<i>so you go</i>
<i>and you interact with this human.</i>

284
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:30,200
<i>And perhaps it does give you</i>
<i>some strange octopus level of joy.</i>

285
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,720
<i>When you have that connection</i>
<i>with an animal</i>

286
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,120
<i>and have those experiences,</i>
<i>it's absolutely mind-blowing.</i>

287
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,240
<i>There's no greater feeling on earth.</i>

288
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,400
<i>The boundaries between her and I</i>
<i>seemed to dissolve.</i>

289
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,040
<i>Just the pure magnificence of her.</i>

290
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,120
<i>All I could do at the time</i>
<i>was just think of her.</i>

291
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,320
<i>In the water and on land.</i>

292
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,640
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>it just became a bit of an obsession.</i>

293
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,800
<i>You just want to visit her</i>
<i>every day and see what's going on.</i>

294
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,680
<i>You can't wait to get back in the water.</i>

295
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,400
<i>What goes through her mind?</i>
<i>What's she thinking?</i>

296
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,360
<i>Does she dream? If she dreams,</i>
<i>what does she dream about?</i>

297
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:05,080
<i>She just ignited my curiosity in a way</i>
<i>that I had not experienced before.</i>

298
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,600
<i>It's very useful to come back home</i>

299
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,040
<i>and try and read</i>
<i>as many scientific papers as possible.</i>

300
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,320
<i>She's a common octopus.</i>

301
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,400
Octopus vulgaris <i>is the scientific name.</i>

302
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,440
<i>Two-thirds of her cognition</i>

303
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,199
<i>is actually outside of her brain,</i>
<i>in her arms.</i>

304
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:42,440
<i>Her entire being</i>
<i>is thinking, feeling, exploring.</i>

305
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,560
<i>She's got 2,000 suckers, and she's using</i>
<i>all of them independently.</i>

306
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,639
<i>How do you do that?</i>

307
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,480
<i>Imagine having 2,000 fingers.</i>

308
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,760
<i>You can compare her intelligence</i>
<i>to a cat or a dog</i>

309
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,680
<i>or even to one of the lower primates.</i>

310
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,920
<i>A mollusk shouldn't be this intelligent.</i>

311
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,200
<i>So many times I'd go and search</i>
<i>through the scientific papers,</i>

312
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,480
<i>looking for the strange thing I'd seen.</i>

313
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,480
<i>And then you'd just come up</i>
<i>absolutely blank. There's nothing.</i>

314
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,760
<i>You're going into a place</i>
<i>that's under-studied,</i>

315
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:29,320
<i>and, almost on a weekly basis,</i>
<i>you can find out something new to science.</i>

316
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,280
<i>According to the literature, octopus</i>
<i>are supposed to be a nocturnal species.</i>

317
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,840
<i>Now, was she more active at night?</i>

318
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,440
<i>It was a little bit scary in the dark.</i>

319
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,400
<i>These incredible sounds</i>
<i>of the humpback whales</i>

320
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,760
<i>coming through the water.</i>

321
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,560
<i>You're on hyperalert.</i>

322
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,560
<i>I couldn't find her.</i>
<i>She wasn't in her den.</i>

323
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,720
<i>I'd kind of given up</i>
<i>and was going back to the shore.</i>

324
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,480
<i>Something just made me</i>
<i>veer slightly to the left.</i>

325
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,320
<i>And there she is...</i>

326
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,960
<i>right in extremely shallow water.</i>

327
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,440
<i>Can't see what she's doing.</i>

328
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,080
<i>These lightning-fast strikes.</i>

329
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,600
<i>Using her arm like this strange weapon.</i>

330
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,960
Just rolling it up
in this fraction of a second.

331
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,240
And I saw her catch three fish like this.

332
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,480
I'd never seen her catching a fish
during the day.

333
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,880
Super dangerous
out in the deeper forest at night,

334
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,520
so this incredibly clever animal
retreats to the shallows,

335
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,960
where it's difficult
for these sharks to get to,

336
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,560
and takes advantage
of all the wonderful food available there.

337
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,280
<i>The first instinct</i>
<i>is to try and scare the sharks away.</i>

338
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,040
<i>But then you realize</i>

339
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,200
<i>that you'd be interfering</i>
<i>with the whole process of the forest.</i>

340
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:08,880
<i>She was out of the den,</i>
<i>moving around near the edge of the forest.</i>

341
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,600
<i>I noticed...</i>

342
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,120
<i>the shark.</i>

343
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,520
<i>Body was slightly hunched forward</i>
<i>and was following the scent trail.</i>

344
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,680
<i>This is not good.</i>

345
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,280
<i>I think, "Thank God she's safe.</i>
<i>She's right under the rock."</i>

346
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,840
<i>These things are coming</i>
<i>right into that crack.</i>

347
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,080
<i>And the next minute, the shark is</i>
<i>actually clamped down on one of her arms,</i>

348
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,000
<i>doing this terrifying death roll.</i>

349
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,960
And I can clearly see...

350
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,560
her severed arm in its mouth.

351
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,320
You had that terrible feeling
in your stomach.

352
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,840
And thank God she managed
to get really deep in that crack.

353
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:32,440
She was moving very badly,
slowly, very weak.

354
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,880
She's bleeding. That smell's in the water.

355
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,200
There's quite a distance to the den.

356
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,560
Are these sharks gonna pitch up again?

357
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,440
I thought about helping her back
physically to the den.

358
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,160
But, luckily, I didn't need to.

359
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,800
I didn't know...

360
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,960
what was gonna happen to her or if this
would make her weak and vulnerable,

361
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,760
and they'd finish her off that night.

362
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,280
And I couldn't help feeling...

363
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,120
had I been responsible for this?

364
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,840
Was she out because I was there?

365
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,040
I felt very vulnerable.

366
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:22,760
As if somehow what happened to her
had happened to me in some strange way.

367
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,000
And then this almost felt,
psychologically, like I was...

368
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,600
going through a type of dismembering.

369
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,200
You start thinking about your own death
and your own vulnerability,

370
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,680
worried about your family, your child.

371
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I hadn't been a person that was
overly sentimental towards animals before.

372
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,240
I realized I was changing.

373
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,600
She was teaching me
to become sensitized to the other.

374
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,600
Especially wild creatures.

375
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,840
<i>A scary feeling,</i>
<i>going into the water early the next day.</i>

376
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,600
<i>I was very relieved</i>
<i>that she was alive, breathing.</i>

377
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,520
<i>She's so weak that she can't make</i>
<i>those vibrant colors of a healthy octopus,</i>

378
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,240
<i>and she's just dull and white.</i>

379
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,680
<i>And now I'm worried,</i>
<i>"How is she getting food?"</i>

380
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,920
<i>You are crossing a line</i>

381
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,160
<i>when you interfere</i>
<i>in the lives of animals.</i>

382
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,600
<i>But I was just too overcome</i>

383
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,520
<i>with my feelings for her.</i>

384
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,720
<i>I don't think it really helped.</i>

385
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:47,960
<i>And she's right at the back of the den,</i>
<i>you know, just not moving much.</i>

386
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,400
<i>I was just checking every day</i>
<i>to see if she was okay,</i>

387
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,880
<i>wondering, "Is this the last day?</i>
<i>Am I not gonna see her?"</i>

388
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,520
The big relief came a week or so later,

389
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,120
and I could see
it had sort of healed over pretty fast.

390
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:31,440
And then the most amazing thing,
to see this...

391
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,920
tiny little miniature,
perfect miniature arm...

392
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,840
starting to grow back.

393
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,360
<i>And it gave me</i>
<i>a strange sort of confidence</i>

394
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,120
<i>that she can get past</i>
<i>this incredible difficulty.</i>

395
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:59,080
<i>And I felt, in my life,</i>
<i>I was getting past the difficulties I had.</i>

396
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:05,320
<i>In this strange way,</i>
<i>our lives were mirroring each other.</i>

397
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,800
<i>My relationship with people,</i>
<i>with humans was changing.</i>

398
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:25,560
<i>My son, at this stage, was very interested</i>
<i>in everything underwater.</i>

399
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,200
<i>And every day, I'd tell him the stories.</i>

400
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,760
<i>He'd seen her. He'd met her.</i>

401
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,680
<i>I'd taken him so many times.</i>

402
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,960
<i>The arm becomes pretty functional,</i>

403
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,840
<i>even when it's half grown.</i>

404
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,360
<i>And then, slowly, as the arm grew,</i>
<i>she grew her confidence back.</i>

405
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,160
<i>Eventually, about 100 days later,</i>
<i>that arm had fully regrown.</i>

406
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,480
<i>An amazing feeling to think</i>
<i>that this animal is capable of that</i>

407
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,880
<i>and can withstand such an attack</i>
<i>and fully recover.</i>

408
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:22,480
<i>After a while, she was just carrying on</i>
<i>with her normal activities,</i>

409
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:26,680
<i>so I then started a whole new development</i>

410
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,320
<i>of seeing even deeper into her world.</i>

411
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,880
<i>It was a nice, calm, clear day.</i>

412
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,800
<i>She comes around a corner</i>
<i>and spots a crab.</i>

413
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,720
<i>The problem when you're a crab,</i>

414
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,080
<i>you're being now hunted</i>
<i>by a liquid animal.</i>

415
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,360
<i>She can pour herself</i>
<i>through a tiny little crack.</i>

416
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,440
<i>And the crab seems to sense her</i>

417
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:16,680
<i>and goes and hides</i>
<i>underneath a big, poisonous anemone.</i>

418
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,680
<i>And then she waits and hides.</i>

419
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,200
<i>And then the crab thinks,</i>
<i>"Okay, everything's all right,"</i>

420
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:54,040
<i>and makes the mistake</i>
<i>of leaving that anemone.</i>

421
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,960
<i>She's quite a messy eater.</i>

422
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,320
<i>Bits going everywhere.</i>
<i>The smell's going out.</i>

423
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:45,680
<i>And then you just look around,</i>
<i>and you see these brittle stars,</i>

424
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,280
<i>surprisingly fast,</i>
<i>just being drawn to her.</i>

425
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,880
<i>Just a mass of them</i>
<i>sort of overwhelm her,</i>

426
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,200
<i>and she doesn't seem sure of what to do</i>
<i>or how to deal with them.</i>

427
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,920
<i>So I thought,</i>
<i>"Yeah, this is like a real problem now.</i>

428
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,480
<i>She's always gonna have this problem</i>
<i>of brittle stars taking all her food."</i>

429
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,160
Not that long in the future,

430
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:23,080
she's thought, "Okay,
brittle stars are stealing my food,"

431
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:26,760
and has this amazing method
of just picking them up with her suckers

432
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,080
and gently just throwing them out the den.

433
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,160
Now she's completely the boss.

434
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,560
She initially adopted the same method
to crab hunting with lobster.

435
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,600
You just suddenly see...

436
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,800
lobsters just shooting out of the reef.

437
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,560
I'm thinking now,
"She's definitely gonna catch this one."

438
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,760
Time and time again, they just evade her.

439
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,840
And then, a couple of weeks later,

440
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,400
watching her coming round the side,

441
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,800
corralling me so that

442
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,360
she can then get between
the lobster and myself.

443
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,680
Using me as part of her hunting strategy.

444
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,520
And instead of that messy lunge...

445
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,160
throwing her web over the top.

446
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,240
And then there's nowhere for it to go.

447
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,000
This is an animal that is strategizing

448
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:29,440
and working out very quickly
how best to hunt a very tricky prey.

449
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,480
A lot of her intelligence is built

450
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,920
from the sheer number of prey
that she has to catch.

451
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,120
All sorts of animals.

452
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,280
All the mollusks she is capturing,
they're quite easy to catch,

453
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,280
but they've got
these incredibly hard shells.

454
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:02,200
Now, how the hell
does she kill and eat them?

455
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,960
At the base of all those arms,

456
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,720
there's a drill
that can drill through hard shell

457
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,880
and then drop venom in there,
like a snake,

458
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,800
and see how that mollusk reacts.

459
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,720
But some of these mollusks will only relax

460
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,520
if that drill is precisely
in the apex of the shell,

461
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,600
on the abductor muscle.

462
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,200
She basically has to do geometry

463
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:43,320
to work out exactly the precise spot
where she needs to drill that shell

464
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,680
in order to get her food.

465
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:52,120
This is high-level
invertebrate intelligence.

466
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:58,120
Her ability to learn and remember details.

467
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:05,080
And it hit me
how she was teaching me so much.

468
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:15,360
You just can't wait to get up in
the morning, 'cause there's so much to do

469
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,960
to understand every little tiny mark,

470
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,240
every little behavior,

471
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,880
every species and what they're doing,
how they're interacting.

472
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,560
People ask, "Why are you going
to the same place every day?"

473
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,240
But that's when you see
the subtle differences.

474
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,040
And that's when you get to know the wild.

475
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,920
So when these thousands of threads
going off from the octopus

476
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,520
to all the other animals,
predator and prey,

477
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,680
and then this incredible forest,

478
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,200
um, just nurturing all of this.

479
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:05,360
And now I know how the helmet shell
is connected to the urchin

480
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,040
and how the octopus
is connected to the helmet shell.

481
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,760
And as I draw all these lines,

482
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,440
all these stories
are just being thrown up.

483
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,360
It's almost like the forest mind.

484
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:36,000
I really could feel it. That big creature.

485
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,680
It was thousands of times more awake
and intelligent than I am.

486
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:47,800
This is like a giant underwater brain
operating over millions of years.

487
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,160
And it just keeps everything in balance.

488
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,560
Everything seemed, at this point...

489
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,360
sort of perfect in the forest.

490
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,120
And, of course, you know...

491
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,360
...you've forgotten...

492
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,520
those predators are ever present.

493
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,160
Just have this...

494
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:13,240
burnt in my memory, this, like, huge shark
just suddenly approaching her.

495
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,000
She kept still and tried to hide.

496
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:34,320
Then you just saw the shark swimming
on the periphery, picking up her scent.

497
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,760
And I thought,
"Oh, no, this is this whole...

498
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:47,840
nightmare happening again."

499
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,960
She jets up in the canopy,

500
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:53,320
and she's wrapping many leaves of kelp
tightly around her body

501
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,960
and then just peering out.

502
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,320
All the smell's on the kelp,

503
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,200
so the shark's now biting
and snapping at the kelp.

504
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,160
She's shot out the back.

505
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:04,200
She just climbs out over a rock,
leaves the water, and I was like...

506
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:12,680
I just, you know...
almost can't believe my eyes.

507
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:20,320
But the problem is, of course,
she's gotta come back.

508
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:32,200
On the other side,
the shark picks up her scent again.

509
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,280
And this crazy chase is on.

510
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,840
And then, I see her,

511
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,040
in a very quick movement,

512
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:18,120
picking up maybe close
to 100 shells and stones...

513
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,320
and then folding her arms

514
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,120
over her vulnerable head.

515
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,960
And in that moment,

516
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,360
I realized,
"This is this crazy thing I saw...

517
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:33,320
so long ago."

518
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,960
Next minute, the shark grabs her.

519
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,840
But I had to breathe.

520
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,920
Rush to the surface as fast as you can.

521
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,160
Straight back down again.

522
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,600
And it's like,
"Okay, now, this is too crazy."

523
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,720
Somehow she's managed to maneuver herself
into the least dangerous place,

524
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,560
and that's on the shark's back.

525
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:04,160
The shark tries to shake her off
and is swimming away.

526
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,600
Takes a few seconds to figure out,

527
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,760
"What the hell's going on here?"

528
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,560
But you can immediately tell

529
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,840
she's now got the upper hand.

530
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,720
As the shark goes near
some of the thick kelp...

531
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,640
she just pushes off the back...

532
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,200
drops the remaining shells

533
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,400
and jets away.

534
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,600
And the shark,
it's just been completely outwitted.

535
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:35,720
The shark comes, does one pass,

536
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,760
but she's completely safe.
There's nothing it can do.

537
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,400
And it leaves.

538
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:51,000
How she can think that quickly
and make those life-and-death decisions,

539
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:55,080
uh, it's just, yeah,
pretty, pretty incredible.

540
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:22,680
I was around for a good
80 percent of her life.

541
01:08:24,439 --> 01:08:27,439
Each moment is so precious
because it's so short.

542
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:33,040
There was this one incredible day.

543
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,960
A big shoal of dream fish.

544
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,160
Fairly shallow water.

545
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,040
Suddenly, she's...

546
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,080
reaching up for the surface like that.

547
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,080
Initially, I thought...

548
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,399
"She's hunting the fish."

549
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,880
Then I was like, "Hold on.

550
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:07,240
When she hunts, she's strategic,
and she's like...

551
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,040
focused.

552
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,600
This behavior
doesn't feel predatory to me."

553
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:24,520
It took a long time
to actually, like, process it.

554
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,279
But I couldn't help thinking,

555
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:30,279
"She's playing with the fish."

556
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,960
You see play often in social animals.

557
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:53,000
Here's a highly antisocial animal
playing with fish.

558
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,600
It takes that animal to a different level.

559
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,880
Oh, then she completely
lost interest in the fish,

560
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,000
rushed over...

561
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,040
grabbed hold of me.

562
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,400
And that was the last time
we had physical contact.

563
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,360
If I think back,

564
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,520
and I remember it was a very rough day,
very turbulent.

565
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:18,880
Sediment everywhere.

566
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,680
Go down and whoa,

567
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,080
there's another big octopus
right next to her.

568
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:38,000
It's very, very rare to see
two octopus close together.

569
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,120
"Oh, my God, what's going on?"

570
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:51,800
And then seeing that both animals
are pretty relaxed

571
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:55,120
and realizing,
"Okay, and then the mating is beginning."

572
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:12,280
By this stage, I knew quite well
the stages of an octopus's life.

573
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:16,800
So while I was very excited
that this mating was beginning,

574
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,520
there was a sort of...

575
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,200
this dread in the bottom of my stomach.

576
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,120
<i>She wasn't coming out of that den.</i>

577
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,480
<i>There was no more feeding,</i>
<i>no more hunting.</i>

578
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:43,280
<i>A huge part of her body</i>
<i>is actually given to those eggs.</i>

579
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:48,160
<i>So she drops in weight, and she loses</i>
<i>an enormous amount of strength.</i>

580
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,720
<i>The eggs are laid right in the back,</i>
<i>in the dark.</i>

581
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,760
<i>It's impossible to see them.</i>

582
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,920
<i>I just keep going every day</i>
<i>and just check.</i>

583
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:13,200
<i>She's oxygenating the eggs</i>
<i>with her siphon, looking after them.</i>

584
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,320
<i>She's just slowly dying</i>

585
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:21,000
<i>and timing her death exactly</i>
<i>for the hatching of those eggs.</i>

586
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,680
<i>I mean, it struck home so hard for me.</i>

587
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,920
<i>Here's an invertebrate,</i>
<i>essentially a mollusk,</i>

588
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,080
<i>sacrificing her own life</i>

589
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:39,800
<i>for her young.</i>

590
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,720
<i>All those eggs hatched.</i>

591
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:59,120
<i>They're tiny,</i>
<i>and they go into the water column.</i>

592
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,360
<i>Hundreds of thousands of them.</i>

593
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:12,600
<i>And the next thing I saw,</i>
<i>she's washed out the den, barely alive.</i>

594
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,240
<i>And the fish, you know, feeding on her.</i>

595
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,840
<i>A lot of the scavengers</i>
<i>coming to feed on her.</i>

596
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,640
<i>It was just heartbreaking.</i>

597
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,520
<i>A part of me just wanted to hold her</i>
<i>and chase them away.</i>

598
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:41,440
<i>But I didn't do that.</i>

599
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:56,360
<i>The next day...</i>

600
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,160
<i>a big shark came...</i>

601
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:16,960
and just took her away,
you know, into the misty forest.

602
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:34,160
Often, I go to the place of her main den.

603
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,320
And I just float above it
and feel her there.

604
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,320
Of course I miss her.

605
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:49,600
Um...

606
01:15:59,000 --> 01:15:59,920
But, um...

607
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,560
I mean, in some crazy way,
it was a relief.

608
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:16,760
It was a relief, because the intensity
of going every day and tracking her, um...

609
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,640
and trying to capture, it was...

610
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,480
It was tough in a way.

611
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:25,640
I mean, I sort of slept, dreamt...

612
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:28,520
this animal.

613
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,440
I was... You know, I was...

614
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:35,080
in my mind, thinking like an octopus.

615
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:38,320
And... and it was all so taxing, in a way.

616
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,200
Um...

617
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:53,200
But underneath that,

618
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,560
this incredible pride for this animal

619
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:01,160
that's been through impossible odds
to get to this place.

620
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,000
I mean, an unimaginable life.

621
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:36,160
<i>One of the most exciting things</i>
<i>ever in my life, taking my son,</i>

622
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:38,960
<i>walking along the shore</i>

623
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:42,200
<i>and just showing him</i>
<i>the... the wonders of nature</i>

624
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:43,360
<i>and the details</i>

625
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,120
<i>and the intricacies.</i>

626
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:54,120
<i>I was getting so much from the wild,</i>
<i>and I could actually now give.</i>

627
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,120
<i>I had so much energy to give back.</i>

628
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:10,560
<i>He's like a little marine biologist now.</i>
<i>He knows so much.</i>

629
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:18,040
<i>And very powerful swimmer.</i>

630
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:25,280
<i>And as he gets older,</i>
<i>he seems to want to do it more and more.</i>

631
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,880
<i>To see that develop,</i>

632
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:42,520
<i>a strong sense of himself...</i>

633
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,720
<i>an incredible confidence,</i>

634
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,040
<i>but the most important thing,</i>

635
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,720
<i>a gentleness.</i>

636
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,400
<i>And I think that's the thing</i>

637
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:59,160
<i>that thousands of hours in nature</i>
<i>can teach a child.</i>

638
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,320
<i>A few months later, after she'd died,</i>

639
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:15,080
<i>he actually found</i>
<i>this tiny little octopus.</i>

640
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:23,160
<i>It's very rare</i>
<i>to see an animal that small.</i>

641
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:31,880
<i>They have up to half a million young.</i>
<i>A handful survive.</i>

642
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:36,800
<i>So it's a pretty tough road</i>
<i>they have to walk.</i>

643
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,440
<i>But that's their strategy,</i>
<i>live fast and die young.</i>

644
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:48,880
<i>We kind of imagined</i>
<i>that it might be one of her young.</i>

645
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:52,440
<i>It was kind of the right size,</i>
<i>the right time.</i>

646
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:00,120
<i>And it was joyous.</i>
<i>It was like, "Well, there she is."</i>

647
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:27,040
<i>She'd made me realize</i>

648
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:30,480
<i>just how precious wild places are.</i>

649
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,000
<i>You go into that water...</i>

650
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,760
<i>and it's extremely liberating.</i>

651
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:47,800
<i>All your...</i>

652
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:52,360
<i>worries and problems</i>
<i>and life drama just dissolve.</i>

653
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:06,120
<i>You slowly start to care</i>
<i>about all the animals,</i>

654
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,440
<i>even the tiniest little animals.</i>

655
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:17,040
<i>You realize</i>
<i>that every one is very important.</i>

656
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:25,280
<i>To sense how vulnerable</i>
<i>these wild animals' lives are,</i>

657
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,240
<i>and actually, then how vulnerable</i>
<i>all our lives on this planet are.</i>

658
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:42,080
<i>My relationship with the sea forest</i>
<i>and its creatures deepens...</i>

659
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,320
<i>week after month after year after year.</i>

660
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,840
<i>You're in touch with this wild place,</i>
<i>and it's speaking to you.</i>

661
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,000
<i>Its language is visible.</i>

662
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,360
<i>I fell in love with her</i>

663
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:20,720
<i>but also with that amazing wildness</i>
<i>that she represented</i>

664
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,880
<i>and... and how that changed me.</i>

665
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,680
What she taught me was to feel...

666
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:44,520
that you're part of this place,
not a visitor.

667
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:46,880
That's a huge difference.

667
01:22:47,305 --> 01:23:47,367
