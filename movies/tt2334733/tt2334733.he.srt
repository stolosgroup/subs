00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,848
<i>Un. Deux.</i>

2
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,716
<i>Trois.</i>

3
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,219
<i>Quatre. Cinq.</i>

00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:11,490
<i>Six. Sept. Huit.</i>

<i>Neuf. Dix.</i>

00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:17,529
<i>Camille, Emma!
En place!</i>

7
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,626
Please God,
let him be the right one.

8
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:22,928
Please God,
let him be the right one.

9
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,370
Please God,
let him be
the right one.

10
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:24,743
Emma...

11
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,550
When your dear mother died,
I cried.

12
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:35,053
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>how to raise</i>
<i>a little girl.</i>

13
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,789
A pig? Yes.

14
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,991
But you, with all
those ideas

15
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,433
in your head,
I could not.

16
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,532
<i>Charles, you are
a good man.</i>

17
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,668
<i>And a good doctor.</i>

18
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,169
<i>Emma's mother
can finally rest</i>

19
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,237
knowing I
married her well.

20
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,977
This was your mother's
favorite wedding gift.

21
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,113
<i>Please think of us
when you eat your sweets.</i>

22
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,919
<i>Santé.</i>

23
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,137
This is Henriette.

24
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,239
Madame.

25
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,974
Would you mind helping
us with some
of these things?

26
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,342
Of course.
Let me, Madame.

27
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,377
Thank you.

28
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,999
<i>What's the matter, dear?</i>

29
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,172
It's all part
of nature.

30
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,977
I need to remove
my dress.

31
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,045
Oh.

32
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,750
I cannot remove
it alone.

33
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:27,018
<i>Sorry.</i>

34
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,538
Sleep, dear.

35
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,306
I didn't want
to wake you.

36
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:56,548
Stay with me.

37
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:02,213
It is the patient
that must find
solace in the bed,

38
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:05,116
never the doctor.

39
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,353
But all doctors
are husbands too,
aren't they?

40
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:11,389
Only in the evenings, dear.

41
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:12,391
Enjoy your day.

42
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,051
They're beautiful, Madame.

43
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,293
Thank you.

44
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,196
Are those
for eating?

45
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,765
Of course.

46
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:43,167
You must have spent
all afternoon on this.

47
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:47,739
You shouldn't go
to such trouble.

48
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:49,574
<i>Henriette is
always quick</i>

49
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:50,936
<i>to pick fruit
from the orchard.</i>

50
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,372
Is that what you
would prefer?

51
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:56,781
It is simply custom.

52
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,959
Fruit, please.

53
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:15,533
Any patients
of note today?

54
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,202
Any curious ailments?

55
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,270
<i>Curious?</i>

56
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:22,306
Um...

57
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:25,343
In the morning,
a patient needed
to be bled.

58
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:30,148
<i>On another,
I applied leeches.</i>

59
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,150
His, uh, wife
prepared me

60
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:34,552
a delicious mushroom
omelet for lunch.

61
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,322
Mm.

62
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,458
Oh, then yes,
in the afternoon,

63
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,428
<i>a patient had something
quite inexplicable.</i>

64
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,096
<i>I examined
his chamber pot twice,</i>

65
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:47,165
<i>but it remains
a mystery.</i>

66
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,145
<i>Madame?</i>

67
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,547
Monsieur Lheureux
is here to see you.

68
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:11,422
Oh, just
as everyone said,
simply beautiful.

69
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,723
That's most kind
of you,

70
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,492
but I must apologize.

71
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,094
It's not proper for me
to receive you

72
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,662
with my hair
in such disarray.

73
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:18,863
<i>No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.</i>

74
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,531
Forgive me
for making haste.

75
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,500
I could not simply let
the day go by

76
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:24,402
without gaining
your confidence.

77
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:26,704
I was told you were
an elegant woman
of taste,

78
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,573
and well,
I am a man

79
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:30,708
in the service
of such women.

80
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,810
Whatever you command,
I will provide you with.

81
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,413
I visit Rouen
at least twice
a week.
You do?

82
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:37,448
Yes, I'm connected
to all the best houses:

83
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,817
"Trois Frères",
"La Barbe d'Or",
"Le Grand Sauvage".

84
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:43,299
<i>Anything you wish.</i>
<i>Romantic novels,</i>
<i>chocolates, candies.</i>

85
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,525
Look at this.
Hm?

86
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,660
Simply beautiful,
is it not?

87
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:50,895
Yes, it is.
Mm.

88
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:52,763
How many
would you like?

89
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:55,166
Oh, I'm afraid I can't.

90
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:57,335
I've only just arrived.
Oh, and this, this,
this, this is...

91
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:59,704
Made of pearl.

92
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:02,373
<i>Carved in open-work</i>
<i>by convicts in</i>
<i>the West Indies.</i>

93
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,575
<i>They are lovely.</i>

94
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:07,345
Oh, but it's too soon.

95
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,613
I want to show
you something.

96
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,188
My father's
wedding gift.

97
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,357
Oh!

98
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,926
Simply beautiful.

99
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:24,362
We have
so much to share.

100
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,464
These, however,
you must have.

101
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:29,934
<i>These are woven
in Algeria</i>

102
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:32,436
<i>but the silk,</i>
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>is of mythical quality.</i>

103
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,705
<i>Touch one, touch one.</i>

104
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:37,608
<i>Ah! You have
exquisite taste!</i>

105
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,876
Thank you.

106
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:41,779
Hey-ah!

107
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,514
Angel.

108
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,886
Look closer.
Look at these spangles.

109
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,922
Almost threads of gold.

110
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:54,258
They scintillate like stars
in the night, do they not?

111
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,194
How much?

112
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:59,830
A mere nothing.

113
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:02,633
It's lovely, really,
but it's too soon.

114
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:05,369
I haven't even spoken
of these matters
with Charles.

115
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,505
Ah, very well,
very well.
I understand.

116
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,774
I will leave you
some fashion journals

117
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:13,811
and a book
of fabrics.

118
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,780
You really
mustn't worry
about the money.

119
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,548
I-I can give you some,
if need be.

120
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,883
On credit,
of course.

121
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,251
I know Charles
is good for it.

122
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:22,286
On credit?

123
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,388
Yes, it means
you can pay me
whenever you like.

124
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,624
Now.

125
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:29,227
<i>This.
Beautiful, no?</i>

126
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,394
Mm.

127
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,689
Ah.
Maison Lheureux.

128
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:01,592
He runs the boutique
out of his own house.

129
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,158
That is the end
of the village.

130
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,660
Come.

131
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,927
Oh, I should introduce
you to Homais.

132
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:40,398
He's our local chemist.
We work closely together.

133
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,633
<i>...look at this
month, mm?</i>

134
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,335
<i>Ah, Emma!</i>

135
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:46,304
You've joined us
at last!

136
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,605
You're beautiful.

137
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:50,308
Ah.
Welcome to Yonville.

138
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,677
My dear, um,
Monsieur Homais,

139
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,414
<i>and uh, Monsieur Binet,
our tax collector.</i>

140
00:21:56,416 --> 00:22:00,751
And uh, Monsieur
Leon Dupuis, our
legal clerk.

141
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,820
Madame no doubt has had
little time to rest

142
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,388
since her journey.

143
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,390
Well, moving
about amuses me.

144
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:08,859
I find it tedious
to always stay
in the same place.

145
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:10,761
I-I couldn't
agree more.

146
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:12,863
Not me. I'm most content
with the same slippers

147
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,799
and same fireplace
every night.

148
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:16,701
Charles, nothing is
more pleasant
than traveling.

149
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:18,502
You wouldn't say
that if you

150
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,705
were constantly obliged
to be in the saddle.

151
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:22,473
<i>You're wrong.</i>
<i>I-I would talk</i>
<i>of nothing else.</i>

152
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:24,375
<i>Just last year,
I was in Switzerland.</i>

153
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:26,811
You can't imagine
the enormity of
the valleys,

154
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:28,813
or the poetry
of the lakes.

155
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:31,982
It-it moved me
to-to such enthusiasm.

156
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,418
I was comm...</i>
<i>Emma, you</i>
<i>mustn't mistake</i>

157
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,520
<i>Leon's profession
for his heart.</i>

158
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,756
He-he-he might
appear to be

159
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:42,360
<i>just a legal clerk,
but secretly inside</i>

160
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:45,563
<i>he's the last romantic
left in all of France.</i>

161
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:47,131
<i>Oh, no, no.
It's no laughing matter.</i>

162
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,033
<i>I'm quite
concerned, actually.</i>

163
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,369
The other day,
I heard him singing

164
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:53,871
The Guardian Angel
in his bedroom,

165
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,006
and he was really
giving it his all.

166
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:58,609
There's nothing that
elevates my soul
more than music.

167
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:02,947
<i>Oh, not you too, Emma!
I need you to be sensible.</i>

168
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:04,915
I have a favor
to ask you, actually.

169
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,984
Of me?
<i>Hm.</i>

170
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:08,652
<i>I'd like to show you
something in the kitchen.</i>

171
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:12,823
Gentlemen, if
you'll excuse us?

172
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,992
<i>Monsieur Binet, could I
trouble you for the bread?</i>

173
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,996
Hippolyte here

174
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:20,831
<i>works at the inn,</i>
<i>day and night,</i>
<i>bussing tables.</i>

175
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:24,735
And he does
all this with
an atrocious impediment.

176
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,670
Isn't that
right, Hippolyte?

177
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:30,174
<i>Show Madame your foot.</i>

178
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:32,877
<i>See?</i>
<i>It's gruesome,</i>
<i>is it not?</i>

179
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:34,111
I'm sorry.

180
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:36,580
<i>Hmm. Now Emma,</i>

181
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,482
as a partisan
of progress,

182
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:41,552
it is my duty
to keep this town
to the fore.

183
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:43,487
Which is why
I need your help

184
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:46,157
to convince Charles
to operate on this
poor man.

185
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,958
<i>I believe I should be
convinced first, sir.</i>

186
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,762
<i>It's for
your own sake!</i>

187
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,165
Well, Madame,
what do you say?

188
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:56,567
I'm afraid it
is not my place
to tell Charles.

189
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:59,970
No. No, forget
convention and modality.

190
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:02,907
There are no risks here,
only advantages.

191
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:06,577
Uh, success.
Certain relief.

192
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,879
Beautification
of the patient.

193
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,881
But no less important,

194
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:13,184
<i>celebrity to be gained
by the surgeon.</i>

195
00:24:13,186 --> 00:24:15,619
All of what you speak
of is most alluring.
Mm-hm.

196
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:18,489
But the decision
is not mine, it's
up to Charles.

197
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:20,891
Oh, very well.

198
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:22,660
But you will at least
help me convince him,

199
00:24:22,662 --> 00:24:24,795
will you not?

200
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:27,865
We'll see.

201
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:29,107
Excellent.

202
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:36,607
I haven't devoted
much time to the garden.

203
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:39,710
It could be
so beautiful.

204
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:41,912
I'll take care
of it.

205
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:44,915
You've never thought
of a fish pond,
perhaps over here?

206
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,817
<i>You'll have plenty</i>
<i>of time to do</i>
<i>as you wish.</i>

207
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,853
<i>Best to come inside.</i>

208
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:50,488
Surely, it's for you
to enjoy as well.

209
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,056
<i>Well, yes.</i>

210
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:53,578
But not so early,
and not in this cold.

211
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,576
<i>Okay, one more.</i>

212
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,978
<i>This should be
the worst of it.</i>

213
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,518
<i>Yeah.</i>

214
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,960
<i>Yeah, it's
coming off.</i>

215
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,760
That's most
of it done.

216
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:39,136
<i>There, there.</i>

217
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:41,498
<i>I think you're good
to cover up now.</i>

218
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:57,721
<i>No, but that is once
you've done the operation.</i>

219
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,898
<i>The diagrams
are very detailed.</i>

220
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,634
Yes, well, you've never
seen anything like them.

221
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:12,136
They use
a hand here.

222
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,277
Now, we must
all understand

223
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,813
the future importance
of this machine.

224
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:25,049
This here
is a symbol
of industry.

225
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:27,184
It is a feat
of engineering.

226
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:29,753
Uh, notice
the treadmill

227
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,623
<i>gives a perfect regularity
of motion to the horse.</i>

228
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:35,125
<i>Here we go,
here we go!</i>

229
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:37,227
<i>But this configuration</i>

230
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,262
<i>seems extremely</i>
<i>uncomfortable for</i>
<i>the horse.</i>

231
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,730
<i>Well...</i>

232
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:41,799
When does
the animal rest?

233
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:44,301
They should have
two horses

234
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,337
taking turns,

235
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:48,105
<i>or some form
of schedule.</i>

236
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,774
Well, I suppose every town
has its diversions.

237
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,110
Is this ours?

238
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,879
Well, it
isn't Paris.

239
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,314
Have you been?

240
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:59,283
I have.

241
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:02,219
It's even better
than you can imagine.

242
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:05,022
It alights
your every sense.

243
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:07,504
Nothing at all
like Yonville.

244
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:11,929
I apologize.
I shouldn't speak that way.

245
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:15,366
You've only
just arrived,
and well...

246
00:27:15,368 --> 00:27:18,068
To be honest,
there's nothing
to feed my soul here

247
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:22,906
but my very own mind.

248
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:25,142
I feel guilty
saying that.

249
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,277
No, don't.

250
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,148
Guilt will bring you
nothing, I swear.

251
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,717
When I was sent
to the convent
for my education,

252
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,953
I had a beautiful idea
of the piety

253
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:39,757
of those pale-faced women
with their rosaries

254
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:42,126
and their convictions.

255
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:46,096
I wanted to be
just as they are,
but I couldn't.

256
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:49,967
I puzzled myself
to find some vow
to fulfill.

257
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:53,103
At confession,
I even invented
little sins.

258
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:55,372
No, I was mortified.

259
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:58,942
I wanted only emotions,
not discipline.

260
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:01,145
Hm.
The good nuns
declared me

261
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:02,913
to be without calling
and cast me out

262
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:04,448
to read romance novels

263
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:08,419
and fulfill the desires
of the heart.

264
00:28:08,421 --> 00:28:11,055
They made me ill,

265
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:12,456
but it was only later
that I realized

266
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,058
that my guilt
had been keeping me

267
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:19,863
from the happiness
I deserved.

268
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,800
And have you found
that happiness here?

269
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:23,287
Forgive me.
I did not
hear you enter.

270
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,391
Charles is visiting
a patient.

271
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:28,592
I'm not here
to see Charles.

272
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:31,061
No?

273
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:33,263
Of how may I
be of service?

274
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:35,098
Of no service.

275
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,001
I hoped you
might accompany
me on a walk.

276
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:40,470
A walk?

277
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,072
It's a lovely day.

278
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,721
I have
a gift for you.

279
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:21,278
I can't accept.

280
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,013
It's a trifle.

281
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:25,048
A relic from my days
in Paris.

282
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,216
Take it.

283
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:46,069
When I was a child,
I had a map like this.

284
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,038
Every night,
I would close my eyes

285
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,408
and trace
down the boulevards
and over the bridges,

286
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,011
imagining myself
in a carriage

287
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:57,247
passing all
the busy people.

288
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,049
All of them
with someplace to be.

289
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:00,051
Hm.

290
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,220
Hoo.

291
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,360
Well, that's
all I've got.

292
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,771
I win again.

293
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:29,272
<i>I'm going to bed.</i>

294
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:30,574
Do you mind
if we play another?

295
00:33:30,576 --> 00:33:32,542
No. Please.
By all means.

296
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:35,078
Good night.

297
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,440
Good night,
Charles.

298
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:43,994
Come with me.

299
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:48,759
Um...

300
00:33:48,761 --> 00:33:51,201
Please. I need
to talk to you.

301
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:56,574
Come.

302
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:21,825
I fear
I might be going mad.

303
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:24,761
I think
of nothing but you.

304
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:28,365
I cannot even hear
my voice in my own head.

305
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:29,607
I only hear yours.

306
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:42,712
I'm married.

307
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:44,634
Tell me
you feel differently.

308
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,523
...parents.
Now go back there,

309
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:01,858
sit down,
and stop messing about.

310
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,827
Charlotte, will you sit
up straight!?

311
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:04,928
Now all of you...

312
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:13,837
The young scamps.

313
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:14,938
They respect nothing.

314
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,710
You look pleasant,
Madame Bovary.

315
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:23,246
I don't feel pleasant,
Monsieur l'Abbé.

316
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:26,783
Nor do I.
Might be what I ate.

317
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,852
Or maybe
it's the season.

318
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:32,489
Cold days weaken one
most remarkably,
don't they?

319
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:34,257
I suppose.

320
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:36,493
Yeah.
As Saint Paul says,

321
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:40,397
we are born to suffer.

322
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:42,566
I've known
poor young mothers,

323
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:44,534
virtuous women,
of course,

324
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,304
veritable saints,

325
00:36:47,306 --> 00:36:48,838
who did not have
enough bread.

326
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:55,245
What of those,
Monsieur l'Abbé,

327
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:57,414
those who have bread,
but don't have any...

328
00:36:57,416 --> 00:37:00,684
Fire in winter?

329
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:04,621
Oh.
Does that matter?

330
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:07,257
Does it matter?

331
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:09,292
Seems to me
that once you
have a good fire,

332
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:12,229
sufficient food,
and a good husband...

333
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:14,297
Boudet!

334
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:16,699
I'll warm your ears
for you, you imp!

335
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:20,937
Talking of which...

336
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:24,307
How is
Monsieur Bovary?

337
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:27,310
Well, that is what I,
what I came to talk
to you about.

338
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:29,412
Sick as well.
Too much work.

339
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:32,249
We two are
the busiest men
in the parish.

340
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:35,819
I, the doctor
of the soul,
he of the body.

341
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:40,023
Oh, you're
most unwell.

342
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:43,260
<i>You should get home.</i>

343
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:46,930
<i>The first communion
will soon be upon us,</i>

344
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,566
<i>and I must make
these devils</i>

345
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:50,568
pious.

346
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,440
And I told you all
to stay still
and be quiet!

347
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,575
Now, look at me.

348
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:23,066
Did you know Leon
was moving to Rouen?

349
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:26,670
Homais told me
this afternoon.

350
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:28,004
He didn't give
much notice.

351
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,939
Homais was quite upset.

352
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:31,775
He needs to find
a new tenant.

353
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:33,943
Did he say when?

354
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:36,680
Tomorrow
or the day after.

355
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:39,549
I never noticed Leon
had such an impulsive
nature before.

356
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:49,659
<i>Shall I tell
the master?</i>

357
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,961
No, don't.

358
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:56,366
It'll only worry him.

359
00:38:56,368 --> 00:38:59,536
It's just my nerves.

360
00:38:59,538 --> 00:39:02,005
<i>This shall pass,
Madame.</i>

361
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:07,444
<i>You'll come
to like it here.</i>

362
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:12,515
I imagined that this
would be the happiest
time in my life,

363
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,950
but the calm here
in which we live

364
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:17,754
is not what
I dreamt of.

365
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:19,656
One after another,
the days come,

366
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:23,393
always the same,
bringing nothing.

367
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,099
Is this the will of God?

368
00:39:29,101 --> 00:39:31,101
Is my future
just a dark corridor

369
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:32,743
with a bolted door
at the end?

370
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:10,967
Always in a book, dear.
You'll strain your eyes.

371
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,536
This book
is fascinating.

372
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:15,205
It's about
the Orient.

373
00:41:15,207 --> 00:41:17,574
<i>Their manner of dress,
the rituals,</i>

374
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:18,808
even their medicine.

375
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,844
I could read it
to you.

376
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:22,745
You might find it
of use.

377
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:24,781
Those are
only curiosities.

378
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:27,684
They have
no application
in Yonville.

379
00:41:27,686 --> 00:41:30,920
But we certainly won't be
spending the rest of our
lives here.

380
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:32,889
I would hate
to disappoint
you, my dear,

381
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,257
but I don't see us
going to the Orient.

382
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:35,992
Well, I know
that, Charles.

383
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:39,062
I was thinking Paris,
or maybe Rouen.

384
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:40,797
Do you really believe
a country doctor

385
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:43,032
can open a practice
in Rouen on a whim?

386
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:45,568
It's...
But you're not
a country doctor!

387
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:45,207
Very good, Madame.
Tighter?

388
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:12,055
<i>My man is opening
a practice in Rouen,</i>

389
00:43:12,057 --> 00:43:13,823
<i>so we are currently
without a doctor</i>

390
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:17,694
- at Vaubeyssard.
- <i> Ah, yes.</i>

391
00:43:17,696 --> 00:43:23,066
Madame Bovary,
I suppose?

392
00:43:23,068 --> 00:43:25,368
You are blessed,

393
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,737
<i>my dear Doctor.</i>

394
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:29,172
<i>Ah. It's most
certainly broken.</i>

395
00:43:29,174 --> 00:43:31,074
Emma, dear,
would you mind
telling Henriette

396
00:43:31,076 --> 00:43:32,976
<i>to warm some water?</i>

397
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:36,913
Okay.

398
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:43,019
I was going to ask,

399
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:45,254
are you on duty
Sunday, Doctor?

400
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:46,923
Uh, no, Monsieur
Le Marquis.

401
00:43:46,925 --> 00:43:48,391
I always spend
Sundays with my wife.

402
00:43:48,393 --> 00:43:50,827
<i>That wouldn't be
a problem.</i>

403
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:52,128
We would, of course
invite Madame Bovary
to come along.

404
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,263
I'm hosting a hunt
next Sunday,

405
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:55,965
<i>and we need
a doctor on premises.</i>

406
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,001
So can I count you in?

407
00:43:58,003 --> 00:44:01,004
Well...

408
00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:04,107
Would... Madame
ride with us?

409
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,750
Uh, a hunt,
you say?

410
00:44:13,752 --> 00:44:17,253
<i>Sunday...</i>

411
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:20,990
Uh, well, I see
no reason why not.

412
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:23,259
<i>Fantastic.
I look forward to it.</i>

413
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,111
Madame Bovary!
It's so good
to see you.

414
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:43,813
Beautiful as ever,
of course.

415
00:44:43,815 --> 00:44:45,715
Charles and I
were treated

416
00:44:45,717 --> 00:44:48,084
with the most
extraordinary invitation.
Oh?

417
00:44:48,086 --> 00:44:50,820
The Marquis D'Andervilliers
invited us to a Chasse
à Courre!

418
00:44:50,822 --> 00:44:52,855
And you don't have
a tenue d'amazone,
I suppose?

419
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,797
This is going to be
very expensive.

420
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,159
You will extend me
credit, will you not?

421
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:20,116
<i>Money should never be</i>
<i>the problem, only</i>
<i>the solution.</i>

422
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:26,322
<i>My dear doctor.</i>

423
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:29,425
Please forgive
us for taking
Madame Bovary along.

424
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:32,128
I leave you
in excellent company.

425
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,930
By all means,
Monsieur le Marquis,

426
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:35,898
enjoy the hunt.

427
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,101
Emma could do
with the fresh
air and exercise.

428
00:45:38,103 --> 00:45:41,304
As for me, a day
not in the saddle
is a day of bliss.

429
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:45,208
<i>I'm much happier here
with the buffet.</i>

430
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:47,944
<i>My dear friends!</i>

431
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:49,779
What good fortune
it is

432
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:52,749
to share this moment
with all of you today.

433
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:54,183
I cannot fully grasp
the reason

434
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:57,019
for my euphoria
this morning.

435
00:45:57,021 --> 00:45:59,322
<i>Hunting is part
of my life and my soul.</i>

436
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:01,124
Who could live
more fully,

437
00:46:01,126 --> 00:46:03,993
love more deeply,
or celebrate so well

438
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:05,128
as the hunter
with his horse

439
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:07,430
and his hounds, hm?

440
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:11,300
So now,
my dear friends,

441
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:12,382
on your saddles!

442
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:04,634
<i>Come in.</i>

443
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:07,703
Good morning,
Monsieur.

444
00:50:07,705 --> 00:50:09,438
Good morning.

445
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,340
Madame.

446
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:25,054
What is it,
Madame?

447
00:50:25,056 --> 00:50:28,758
You don't wear
a uniform.

448
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,128
No, Madame.
I never have.

449
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:34,397
Of course not.
It's my fault.

450
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:37,433
I've never bought
you one.

451
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:40,036
<i>I'm happy to wear</i>
<i>my own clothes,</i>
<i>Madame.</i>

452
00:50:40,038 --> 00:50:42,571
Yes, but a uniform
is a proper dress

453
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:44,807
of someone
of your profession.

454
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:48,344
<i>Go see Lheureux.</i>

455
00:50:48,346 --> 00:50:50,813
He'll dress
you appropriately.

456
00:50:50,815 --> 00:50:53,015
<i>As you
wish, Madame.</i>

457
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:00,589
What's that?

458
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:02,391
What's what?

459
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,160
That box.

460
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:08,464
Ah. It's a cigar case.

461
00:51:08,466 --> 00:51:10,199
I couldn't find
an opportune moment

462
00:51:10,201 --> 00:51:11,441
<i>to return it
to the Marquis.</i>

463
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:27,349
You should save it
'til after you've
operated on Hippolyte.

464
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:29,431
I'll have this
returned to the Marquis.

465
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:37,860
I've been thinking.

466
00:51:37,862 --> 00:51:40,362
<i>What's there to think
about, dear?</i>

467
00:51:40,364 --> 00:51:42,832
<i>We must progress.</i>

468
00:51:42,834 --> 00:51:46,202
<i>As Homais said,
there are only benefits.</i>

469
00:51:46,204 --> 00:51:50,172
<i>No, there are risks.</i>

470
00:51:50,174 --> 00:51:51,607
How do you think
the Marquis' doctor

471
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:55,578
opened a practice
in Rouen?

472
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,712
<i>He took risks.</i>

473
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:04,787
I would like all
of these curtains changed.

474
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:06,856
I want them to be made
of gold damask

475
00:52:06,858 --> 00:52:10,426
with an embroidered
print of some kind.

476
00:52:10,428 --> 00:52:13,708
I know
just the look
you want.

477
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:19,468
I would also like
new linens,

478
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,704
and two
silver candelabras.

479
00:52:21,706 --> 00:52:24,507
Silver?
Well, surely gold
is twice as much.

480
00:52:24,509 --> 00:52:27,476
Yes, but if you bought
one large gold candelabra,

481
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,445
it would fit
the table better.

482
00:52:29,447 --> 00:52:31,480
It wouldn't cost
much more than
two silver ones.

483
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,415
Hm.
Hm.

484
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:35,584
Anything else?

485
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:37,353
There was
one more item.

486
00:52:37,355 --> 00:52:39,388
<i>Well,
don't hesitate.</i>

487
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:41,423
I saw
a rug in...

488
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:42,758
<i>A rug!</i>
<i>That's not</i>
<i>drinking the sea.</i>

489
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,793
But what about
the dresses?

490
00:52:44,795 --> 00:52:46,228
<i>We'll get</i>
<i>those too!</i>
<i>Stop dithering.</i>

491
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:49,698
Take it, take it.

492
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,867
Each moment you do
not possess what
you love

493
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:54,703
is a moment
not spent in love.

494
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:57,773
And a heart without love
is a heart without a voice.

495
00:52:57,775 --> 00:52:59,675
No song, no life.

496
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:13,689
Do you like this
for the fair?

497
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,858
Doesn't feel
too austere, does it?

498
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,394
You look
beautiful, Madame.

499
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:20,896
<i>You have
such a figure.</i>

500
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:24,466
A spoonful of vinegar
with every meal.

501
00:53:24,468 --> 00:53:27,908
After a week,
you don't even
taste it anymore.

502
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:51,961
Ah!

503
00:53:51,963 --> 00:53:54,897
Doctor.
Madame.

504
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:56,532
<i>What a superb morning!</i>

505
00:53:56,534 --> 00:53:58,634
<i>Yes.
Everybody is out.</i>

506
00:53:58,636 --> 00:54:00,903
It's not,
uh, too cold.

507
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:04,673
Ah, my goodness!
What an amazing beast!

508
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:05,975
Remarkable.

509
00:54:07,812 --> 00:54:09,778
<i>Ah, it's time
for the awards.</i>

510
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,879
<i>Well, I won't keep
you from the ceremony.</i>

511
00:54:10,881 --> 00:54:12,414
Pleasure seeing
you both.

512
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:13,656
Good day.

513
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:22,358
Dear, would it bother
you terribly

514
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,526
if I ran home
to rest?

515
00:54:24,528 --> 00:54:26,028
I'm feeling fatigued
but I'd hate to miss

516
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,830
this evening's festivities.

517
00:54:27,832 --> 00:54:28,864
Are you unwell?

518
00:54:28,866 --> 00:54:30,499
No, just tired.

519
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:32,034
Would you like me
to join you?

520
00:54:32,036 --> 00:54:35,556
No, no, dear.
I know you
enjoy this.

521
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,308
Your note
worried me.

522
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:14,390
Are you
not feeling well?

523
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:18,080
In all truth?

524
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:20,549
I'm drifting
into depression.

525
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:24,053
You?

526
00:55:24,055 --> 00:55:25,854
If only I'd found
some love,

527
00:55:25,856 --> 00:55:27,956
I wouldn't have to act
such turbulent joys

528
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:31,527
or fling myself
into such fantasies
and follies.

529
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:37,633
As a woman,
I'm not permitted
such distractions.

530
00:55:37,635 --> 00:55:40,869
Sad distractions.

531
00:55:40,871 --> 00:55:42,404
For happiness
is not found in it.

532
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:47,910
<i>Gentlemen, may I be
permitted first of all</i>

533
00:55:47,912 --> 00:55:50,446
<i>to pay tribute</i>
<i>to the higher</i>
<i>administration</i>

534
00:55:50,448 --> 00:55:52,514
<i>to the government.</i>

535
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:54,483
<i>For friends, it is
my duty to pay tribute...</i>

536
00:55:54,485 --> 00:55:57,853
Again, duty.
It's always duty.

537
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:02,791
I'm sick
of that word.

538
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:05,861
One's duty is
to feel what
is great,

539
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:07,730
to cherish
the beautiful,

540
00:56:07,732 --> 00:56:10,966
not accept
the conventions
of society.

541
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:13,369
To some extent,
one must bow

542
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:14,737
to the opinions
of the world,

543
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:16,739
and accept
its moral code.

544
00:56:16,741 --> 00:56:19,101
But there are
two codes.

545
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:24,113
There's the eternal,
the poetic, which
is ours.

546
00:56:24,115 --> 00:56:26,915
And the other?

547
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:30,686
Sad... convention.

548
00:56:30,688 --> 00:56:33,122
With all due respect,
Monsieur le Marquis,

549
00:56:33,124 --> 00:56:34,757
we should put an end
to this discussion.

550
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,670
Then I shall-I shall be
something to you?

551
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:47,569
I can only offer you
my friendship.

552
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:56,044
<i>How dare you?</i>

553
00:56:56,046 --> 00:56:57,913
<i>You come here to offer
me your friendship?</i>

554
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,082
Ha.

555
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,628
Madame Bovary.

556
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:56,931
Charles forgot
to return this.

557
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:02,738
You didn't come
here all the way

558
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:04,206
through the woods

559
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:05,874
to return
a cigar case, did you?

560
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,045
Please.

561
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,153
Well,

562
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:20,289
I have been thinking.

563
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:22,858
<i>Really? And what have
you been thinking about?</i>

564
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:29,197
Well, I realized
that before getting married,

565
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:31,233
I was contemplating
my coming life

566
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:34,136
like a child
in a theater.

567
00:59:34,138 --> 00:59:38,607
Um, sitting there
in-in high spirits,

568
00:59:38,609 --> 00:59:42,144
and eagerly waiting
for the play to begin.

569
00:59:42,146 --> 00:59:44,212
It was a blessing
in my early youth

570
00:59:44,214 --> 00:59:48,250
that I did not know
what was really going
to happen.

571
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:50,619
<i>When I look back now,
it seems that I was like</i>

572
00:59:50,621 --> 00:59:52,821
an innocent prisoner,

573
00:59:52,823 --> 00:59:55,290
condemned not to death
but to life,

574
00:59:55,292 --> 01:00:00,829
and as yet unconscious
of what the sentence meant.

575
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:03,365
The longer I live,
the more clearly

576
01:00:03,367 --> 01:00:04,933
I feel
that on a whole...

577
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,072
Life is
a-a disappointment.

578
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:14,276
Oh, my dear.

579
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:16,144
Perhaps you are
simply in need
of a confidante.

580
01:00:16,146 --> 01:00:17,980
A lady friend
who could advise you

581
01:00:17,982 --> 01:00:20,182
<i>in such feminine matters.</i>

582
01:00:20,184 --> 01:00:22,751
<i>Unfortunately, I'm not...</i>
I came here
because I
need you.

583
01:00:22,753 --> 01:00:24,353
I will not remain
standing inert

584
01:00:24,355 --> 01:00:26,054
in this fever
of despair.

585
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:34,396
My dear Emma, you are
unrelentingly standing

586
01:00:34,398 --> 01:00:36,131
under an apple tree,
wishing to smell

587
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:38,100
the scent
of orange blossoms.

588
01:00:38,102 --> 01:00:41,269
So yes, you are
indeed standing inert.

589
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:45,140
<i>Lost in a world
of illusions.</i>

590
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:47,109
<i>You like to hear
the words</i>

591
01:00:47,111 --> 01:00:49,678
but you have no courage
to act upon your feelings.

592
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,279
I do!

593
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:53,181
I do have courage!

594
01:00:53,183 --> 01:00:57,252
Please, do not push
me away!

595
01:00:57,254 --> 01:01:02,124
Yes... indeed.

596
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:07,796
It took you
a lot of courage

597
01:01:07,798 --> 01:01:09,958
just to come here,
didn't it?

598
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:18,493
<i>Madame? Monsieur Homais.</i>

599
01:03:18,495 --> 01:03:20,862
<i>Oh, Emma, Emma,
Emma, Emma.</i>

600
01:03:20,864 --> 01:03:22,497
You are beautiful,
you are wise,

601
01:03:22,499 --> 01:03:24,332
and you are magic.

602
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:26,034
I don't know
how you've done it.

603
01:03:26,036 --> 01:03:27,869
Oh, it's all
Monsieur Lheureux.

604
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:30,105
- Monsieur Lheur...?
- Ah!

605
01:03:30,107 --> 01:03:32,340
Forgive me. I wasn't
commenting on the house,

606
01:03:32,342 --> 01:03:35,443
which is indeed
in exquisite taste.

607
01:03:35,445 --> 01:03:38,180
No, Charles
has agreed to operate

608
01:03:38,182 --> 01:03:43,151
on Hippolyte's
wretched foot! Yes!

609
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:46,154
This book contains
everything he must
know for the surgery.

610
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:47,956
Do not let him rest

611
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:49,291
until he has learned
it all. You hear me?

612
01:03:49,293 --> 01:03:50,525
Yes.
Excellent.

613
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,527
And very soon,

614
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:54,449
you will be the wife
of a famous country surgeon.

615
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:58,433
What?

616
01:03:58,435 --> 01:04:01,570
This is what you want,
is it not?

617
01:04:01,572 --> 01:04:04,105
Of course.
Of course.

618
01:04:04,107 --> 01:04:06,942
Study hard, Charles!

619
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:41,610
Do you love me?

620
01:04:41,612 --> 01:04:44,946
Of course I do.

621
01:04:44,948 --> 01:04:46,214
A great deal?

622
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:49,651
Yes.

623
01:04:49,653 --> 01:04:54,055
And you haven't
loved any others?

624
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:57,425
You didn't think
you'd got a virgin,
did you?

625
01:04:57,427 --> 01:05:00,228
Of course not.

626
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,663
But I love you
so that I could
not live

627
01:05:01,665 --> 01:05:03,331
without you.
Don't you see?

628
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:15,503
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
of Yonville,</i>

629
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:18,340
you see before you
your great doctor,

630
01:06:18,342 --> 01:06:20,442
<i>Charles Bovary,</i>

631
01:06:20,444 --> 01:06:22,344
<i>who today
will finally cure</i>

632
01:06:22,346 --> 01:06:24,179
<i>our poor crippled
friend Hippolyte</i>

633
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:27,615
of his most
ignominious of traits.

634
01:06:27,617 --> 01:06:30,218
You may come forward,
but keep your calm.

635
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:31,486
<i>Remember.</i>

636
01:06:34,591 --> 01:06:36,558
<i>Some more brandy.</i>

637
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,694
Come, come.
Take a good
slug of that.

638
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:42,297
<i>Good boy.</i>

639
01:06:42,299 --> 01:06:44,599
<i>Monsieur Dubuc,
if you would hold the box.</i>

640
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:48,270
It must not move.

641
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:51,606
<i>We shall begin.</i>

642
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:54,242
Shhh.

643
01:07:04,287 --> 01:07:07,355
<i>I know.</i>
<i>I know.</i>
<i>Shhh.</i>

644
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:08,523
<i>Second incision.</i>

645
01:07:11,094 --> 01:07:12,094
<i>Shhh.</i>

646
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:15,697
You're nearly done.

647
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:19,200
<i>You're nearly done.</i>

648
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:21,236
Despite the prejudices
that still invest

649
01:07:21,238 --> 01:07:23,304
a part of Europe
like a net,

650
01:07:23,306 --> 01:07:25,340
the light of hope
begins to penetrate

651
01:07:25,342 --> 01:07:27,509
our country places.

652
01:07:27,511 --> 01:07:29,411
Thus it was
on Tuesday,

653
01:07:29,413 --> 01:07:31,246
our little town
of Yonville

654
01:07:31,248 --> 01:07:32,647
found itself
the stage

655
01:07:32,649 --> 01:07:34,649
of a great
surgical operation

656
01:07:34,651 --> 01:07:39,387
<i>and loftiest act
of philanthropy.</i>

657
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:43,191
<i>Monsieur Bovary, our most
distinguished practitioner,</i>

658
01:07:43,193 --> 01:07:47,695
<i>performed an operation
on a club footed man.</i>

659
01:07:47,697 --> 01:07:51,332
Moreover, that operation
was performed as if
by magic.

660
01:07:51,334 --> 01:07:55,136
<i>And barely a few drops</i>
<i>of blood appeared</i>
<i>on the skin,</i>

661
01:07:55,138 --> 01:07:57,405
<i>as though to say that
the rebellious tendon</i>

662
01:07:57,407 --> 01:08:00,141
<i>had at last...</i>

663
01:08:00,143 --> 01:08:02,544
Uh, given way
beneath the endeavors

664
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:04,579
of the surgical art.

665
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:07,582
To progress.

666
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:09,350
To progress!

667
01:08:09,352 --> 01:08:11,286
<i>Help! Help!</i>

668
01:08:11,288 --> 01:08:12,821
I'm going mad.

669
01:08:12,823 --> 01:08:14,456
He won't
stop screaming.
Alright.

670
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:16,291
He thinks
he's dying.
Calm down.

671
01:08:16,293 --> 01:08:18,626
What's the matter
with our ungrateful patient?

672
01:08:18,628 --> 01:08:20,361
He's having
hideous convulsions.

673
01:08:20,363 --> 01:08:22,130
He struck the machine
on his leg

674
01:08:22,132 --> 01:08:25,166
against the wall
enough to break it.
Yes.

675
01:08:25,168 --> 01:08:27,168
Go, Charles.

676
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:29,204
You must ensure the success
of the operation.

677
01:08:29,206 --> 01:08:30,338
<i>We'll return shortly.</i>

678
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:44,385
Well?

679
01:08:44,387 --> 01:08:45,753
I removed the box,
but the swelling

680
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:47,856
is much worse
than I imagined.

681
01:08:47,858 --> 01:08:49,691
Perhaps it was
a vulgus.

682
01:08:49,693 --> 01:08:52,460
What?

683
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:54,822
I may have cut
the wrong tendon.

684
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,268
I'm worried
that if it, uh,

685
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:02,337
does not heal properly
and gangrene sets in,

686
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:03,771
then we will have
to amputate.

687
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:09,677
My love...
Don't touch me.

688
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,479
What is it?

689
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:13,081
This was
not meant to be.

690
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:19,854
You know
how much
I love you...
Stop it!

691
01:09:19,856 --> 01:09:23,936
Calm down.
You're not
being yourself.
Leave me alone!

692
01:09:55,925 --> 01:10:00,728
How can Charles
be so complacent?

693
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:04,365
He has no notion
of my torment.

694
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:06,434
If he'd even once just
tried to understand me,

695
01:10:06,436 --> 01:10:07,676
I wouldn't have...

696
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,780
He's the cause
of my misery.

697
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:19,747
I wish
he would beat me,

698
01:10:19,749 --> 01:10:21,909
so I might have
a reason to hate him.

699
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:35,463
<i>You're-you're here.</i>

700
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:40,335
Take me away.
I beg you.

701
01:10:40,337 --> 01:10:41,736
Oh.

702
01:10:43,807 --> 01:10:47,542
You can't do this.

703
01:10:47,544 --> 01:10:49,010
It's reckless.

704
01:10:49,012 --> 01:10:52,413
You're compromising
yourself.

705
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,949
You're married, Emma.

706
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:56,751
We could be married.

707
01:10:56,753 --> 01:11:00,021
We could go live elsewhere.
In Paris!

708
01:11:02,792 --> 01:11:05,426
You really are mad.
How is that possible?

709
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:08,529
Please! I thought
I married a doctor,
but he's not.

710
01:11:08,531 --> 01:11:12,500
He's a butcher.
He tortures me.

711
01:11:12,502 --> 01:11:14,936
I can't stand another day
of having to eat

712
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:16,838
while peasants cough

713
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:19,307
and recount their whole
vile medical histories.

714
01:11:23,713 --> 01:11:26,614
Have courage.
Be patient.

715
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:28,716
I have been patient!

716
01:11:28,718 --> 01:11:30,685
I've suffered long enough!

717
01:11:30,687 --> 01:11:32,847
<i>You can't leave me
like this!</i>

718
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,664
Very well.

719
01:11:42,666 --> 01:11:44,666
<i>Give me some time
to arrange some affairs.</i>

720
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:10,692
You look beautiful.

721
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:27,775
Henriette, will you
please stop crying?

722
01:12:27,777 --> 01:12:30,478
Listen, you will take
good care of Charles,

723
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,813
won't you?

724
01:12:31,815 --> 01:12:33,348
You have
to promise me.

725
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:34,782
He is a good man.

726
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:50,098
<i>Thank you.</i>

727
01:12:56,839 --> 01:12:58,506
Who is it?

728
01:12:58,508 --> 01:13:00,228
A gift
from Monsieur le Marquis.

729
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:44,752
<i>Monsieur Homais.</i>

730
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:46,874
<i>Forgive me, forgive me.
I had to see for myself.</i>

731
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:49,157
<i>A plum?</i>

732
01:13:49,159 --> 01:13:51,826
No, no, no.
I don't believe that.

733
01:13:51,828 --> 01:13:54,128
<i>That's extraordinary!</i>

734
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:55,997
<i>Yes, the irregularities
of the nervous system</i>

735
01:13:55,999 --> 01:13:57,999
can be... perplexing.

736
01:13:58,001 --> 01:14:01,436
Well, you know,
my friend Bridaux
has a dog

737
01:14:01,438 --> 01:14:03,671
that, uh, goes
into convulsions

738
01:14:03,673 --> 01:14:05,640
every time you
hold a snuff box
up to him.

739
01:14:05,642 --> 01:14:06,808
<i>It's curious though,
isn't it?</i>

740
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:08,943
No.
It's not.

741
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:11,612
<i>You will wake Emma.</i>

742
01:14:15,484 --> 01:14:18,953
Rest, dear.
Rest.

743
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:23,644
Here's the leg.

744
01:16:23,646 --> 01:16:24,946
This should certainly
improve our friend's step.

745
01:16:24,948 --> 01:16:26,681
The socket
is lined with cork.

746
01:16:26,683 --> 01:16:28,182
It has spring joints
but function aside,

747
01:16:28,184 --> 01:16:30,184
consider only
the aesthetics.

748
01:16:30,186 --> 01:16:31,953
I did not order this.

749
01:16:31,955 --> 01:16:33,754
<i>Oh, Madame Bovary
ordered it.</i>

750
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:36,691
And it was not inexpensive.
Three hundred francs.

751
01:16:36,693 --> 01:16:38,059
<i>It's been
over a month now</i>

752
01:16:38,061 --> 01:16:39,961
and she did not leave
a deposit,

753
01:16:39,963 --> 01:16:41,162
so I will require
complete payment
right away.

754
01:16:41,164 --> 01:16:43,364
Well, you may keep it.

755
01:16:43,366 --> 01:16:45,800
Oh, I can't.
It's made to precise
individual measurements.

756
01:16:45,802 --> 01:16:47,602
But I cannot pay you.

757
01:16:47,604 --> 01:16:48,970
<i>Charles,
you are obliged to.</i>

758
01:16:48,972 --> 01:16:52,607
Otherwise, I must
exercise the law.

759
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:54,241
I will give you
until spring to pay,

760
01:16:54,243 --> 01:16:56,377
then I'll extend you
an additional 500 francs

761
01:16:56,379 --> 01:16:59,347
on your loan to cover
whatever costs incurred
by Madame's...

762
01:16:59,349 --> 01:17:00,748
Illness.
Illness.

763
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:01,750
Fine.

764
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:06,320
My dear Charles,
I think I may have

765
01:17:06,322 --> 01:17:08,389
the cure for Madame.

766
01:17:14,396 --> 01:17:19,233
Emma, are you familiar
with the great baritone
Romeo Fidanza?

767
01:17:19,235 --> 01:17:21,402
Yes, of course.

768
01:17:21,404 --> 01:17:22,837
Well, what
about him?

769
01:17:22,839 --> 01:17:24,372
Oh, my closest supplier,

770
01:17:24,374 --> 01:17:25,873
the owner
of La Maison Trois Frères,

771
01:17:25,875 --> 01:17:27,975
is holding a recital.

772
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:30,811
I have
a few invitations.

773
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:33,114
Only for my best clients,
of course.

774
01:17:33,116 --> 01:17:36,183
This is exactly
what she needs.

775
01:17:36,185 --> 01:17:38,819
To wear a beautiful gown,
to be herself,

776
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:43,324
and take pleasure
in what she loves.

777
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:45,059
Emma, think of it.
What a figure you'll cut

778
01:17:45,061 --> 01:17:47,421
in that beautiful
silk gown, hm?

779
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:52,337
The one
with the bow
in the back.

780
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,234
Emma, dear.

781
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:02,169
You won't believe
who is here!

782
01:19:02,171 --> 01:19:04,939
Leon!
What a coincidence.

783
01:19:04,941 --> 01:19:07,508
Is this your first time
in Rouen?

784
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:10,211
<i>I-I studied medicine here
but it's Emma's first time.</i>

785
01:19:10,213 --> 01:19:12,246
<i>First time</i>
<i>to a chamber recital?</i>
Yes.

786
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:14,849
And?
It was
absolutely beautiful.

787
01:19:14,851 --> 01:19:17,118
What this
must mean to you.

788
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,253
So, tell
us, Leon,

789
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:21,088
how is life
in Rouen?

790
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:23,090
I've been working
at a rather large office,

791
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:25,426
getting excellent practice
while I finish my studies.

792
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:27,895
Have you found time
to enjoy Rouen's
cultural life?

793
01:19:27,897 --> 01:19:30,898
Oh, yes.
I go to the opera
quite often.

794
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,466
I've seen
all the great tenors.

795
01:19:32,468 --> 01:19:36,237
Rubini, Grisi, Periani.
I can't imagine.

796
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:38,139
Rubini is
performing tomorrow.

797
01:19:38,141 --> 01:19:40,174
He is sublime.
You should come.

798
01:19:40,176 --> 01:19:42,309
Oh, unfortunately,
I must be back
in the morning.

799
01:19:42,311 --> 01:19:44,512
<i>In all honesty, I never
summoned the courage</i>

800
01:19:44,514 --> 01:19:46,180
<i>to go to the opera</i>
<i>in the four years</i>
<i>I spent here.</i>

801
01:19:46,182 --> 01:19:48,215
<i>I don't fully
understand the purpose.</i>

802
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:50,551
<i>Doesn't the music drown
out all the words</i>

803
01:19:50,553 --> 01:19:52,286
<i>and make it</i>
<i>impossible to...</i>
Charles!

804
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:55,189
Do you wish
to stay, my dear?

805
01:19:55,191 --> 01:19:56,924
We could meet
at the cathedral.

806
01:19:56,926 --> 01:19:59,827
You must see it.

807
01:19:59,829 --> 01:20:01,896
<i>Think it over, dear.</i>

808
01:20:01,898 --> 01:20:03,898
Night brings counsel.

809
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:53,534
Hippolyte!
Give me a hand here.

810
01:23:08,249 --> 01:23:11,685
How do you feel
with the boot?

811
01:23:11,687 --> 01:23:14,167
Just give me some coppers
and I'll carry your bags.

812
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:20,027
That one.

813
01:23:21,429 --> 01:23:22,563
Thanks.

814
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,255
What is it?

815
01:23:54,729 --> 01:23:56,230
My father passed.

816
01:23:57,732 --> 01:23:58,732
Oh!

817
01:24:46,714 --> 01:24:48,348
I just heard the news,

818
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:50,417
and under the sad
circumstances,

819
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:53,620
<i>I thought I'd come along
and offer my services.</i>

820
01:24:53,622 --> 01:24:56,757
Thank you,
but we can do without.

821
01:24:56,759 --> 01:24:58,392
Are you sure?

822
01:24:58,394 --> 01:24:59,560
<i>Yes.</i>

823
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:03,464
I beg
your pardon, Madame,

824
01:25:03,466 --> 01:25:06,500
but I should like a word
with you in private.

825
01:25:06,502 --> 01:25:08,902
<i>It's about
that affair.</i>

826
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:32,451
<i>I have been very good
to you, Emma.</i>

827
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:37,531
Weren't you glad to come
across old acquaintances
in Rouen?

828
01:25:37,533 --> 01:25:41,401
Don't you think
your timing is
a trifle inopportune?

829
01:25:41,403 --> 01:25:43,537
Your husband
is a good fellow.

830
01:25:43,539 --> 01:25:45,806
Kind. Honorable.

831
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:47,808
What do you want?

832
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:49,543
Your debt
has become
quite formidable,

833
01:25:49,545 --> 01:25:51,145
but you know that
well enough by now.

834
01:25:51,147 --> 01:25:54,248
This matter
specifically relates

835
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:57,551
to your little... fancies
in Rouen.

836
01:25:57,553 --> 01:25:59,486
His father
is not yet buried,

837
01:25:59,488 --> 01:26:01,355
and you blackmail me?

838
01:26:01,357 --> 01:26:03,290
Well, I happen to know
Charles has inherited

839
01:26:03,292 --> 01:26:05,192
a plot of land
just outside the town

840
01:26:05,194 --> 01:26:07,461
with 14 acres, so...

841
01:26:07,463 --> 01:26:08,829
I could extend
his credit.

842
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:10,197
But in his state...

843
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:15,402
I think it better
if he gave you
power of attorney.

844
01:26:15,404 --> 01:26:17,604
That way, we,
you and I...

845
01:26:17,606 --> 01:26:19,966
Could continue our little
business transactions.

846
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:35,756
This one.

847
01:26:39,494 --> 01:26:40,527
This one...

848
01:26:43,665 --> 01:26:45,232
Not this one.

849
01:27:24,272 --> 01:27:26,273
Dear, you are wrong
to get so impatient.

850
01:27:26,275 --> 01:27:28,542
It's awful.
My fingers
have gone stiff.

851
01:27:28,544 --> 01:27:30,444
I know.
Try again.

852
01:27:38,586 --> 01:27:41,555
It's no use.
I can't get better
without instruction.

853
01:27:41,557 --> 01:27:42,889
Don't say that.

854
01:27:42,891 --> 01:27:46,893
<i>But it's true.</i>

855
01:27:46,895 --> 01:27:49,396
The only teachers
are in Rouen.

856
01:27:49,398 --> 01:27:52,299
Well, if you must,
take a lesson.

857
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:26,420
Ah!

858
01:30:28,456 --> 01:30:30,724
How was your day?

859
01:30:30,726 --> 01:30:31,892
Good.

860
01:30:39,734 --> 01:30:44,104
I was admiring
this magnificent
new rug, Emma.

861
01:30:44,106 --> 01:30:46,673
<i>Why, thank you.</i>

862
01:30:46,675 --> 01:30:49,543
Has Henriette
not served you yet?

863
01:30:49,545 --> 01:30:51,111
No.

864
01:30:51,113 --> 01:30:53,013
Oh, dear.
You must be starving.

865
01:30:53,015 --> 01:30:55,135
I'll fetch
dinner immediately.

866
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:14,768
What is it, Charles?

867
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:16,970
What has your friend
gotten into your head?

868
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:21,541
Homais?
Nothing.

869
01:31:21,543 --> 01:31:23,243
<i>Lheureux was looking
for you today.</i>

870
01:31:23,245 --> 01:31:25,812
He brought over a bill,
and I opened it.

871
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:28,114
Oh, dear.
Why did you do that?

872
01:31:28,116 --> 01:31:30,150
I need you to know
that I do not make,

873
01:31:30,152 --> 01:31:34,488
nor ever have made,
enough money to pay
what is due.

874
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:37,757
Please, dear. You upset
yourself unnecessarily.

875
01:31:37,759 --> 01:31:40,794
Look around.
Look at everything we have.

876
01:31:40,796 --> 01:31:42,929
The rugs,
the new curtains,

877
01:31:42,931 --> 01:31:44,764
the chairs.

878
01:31:44,766 --> 01:31:47,701
Really, Charles,
look at everything.

879
01:31:47,703 --> 01:31:49,603
You must confess
that considering
the quantity,

880
01:31:49,605 --> 01:31:51,738
the cost isn't too dear.

881
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:53,006
<i>Those are
all extravagances!</i>

882
01:31:53,008 --> 01:31:56,576
I could have done
without them all!

883
01:31:56,578 --> 01:31:58,979
But you enjoy it.

884
01:31:58,981 --> 01:32:00,914
Do you not sit
in your chair every day?

885
01:32:00,916 --> 01:32:02,883
But I didn't need
it upholstered.

886
01:32:02,885 --> 01:32:04,718
Nor do I need
silk lining
in my jacket,

887
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:08,000
or pistachio cream
for my dessert
or oysters!

888
01:32:16,597 --> 01:32:18,878
Not everybody
can be rich, dear.

889
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,848
<i>September 2nd,
200 francs.</i>

890
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:37,150
October 5th,
three-seventy-five francs.

891
01:32:37,152 --> 01:32:40,120
November 20th,
450 francs.

892
01:32:40,122 --> 01:32:42,589
There's no end
to this.

893
01:32:42,591 --> 01:32:45,191
You owe me
ten thousand francs,

894
01:32:45,193 --> 01:32:47,928
and you must begin to pay.

895
01:32:47,930 --> 01:32:50,664
But I have nothing
to pay you with!
Oh, but you do.

896
01:32:50,666 --> 01:32:51,932
Charles' inheritance.

897
01:33:06,147 --> 01:33:07,781
It shall be finished.

898
01:33:19,193 --> 01:33:20,860
What are you doing here?
Why today?

899
01:33:20,862 --> 01:33:23,263
I had a horrible fight
with Charles.

900
01:33:23,265 --> 01:33:25,265
I'm working.
I can't see
you now.

901
01:33:25,267 --> 01:33:27,167
Come now.
You can slip
out with me.

902
01:33:27,169 --> 01:33:28,702
That's impossible.
My master has already

903
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:30,136
complained about
my absences.

904
01:33:30,138 --> 01:33:32,138
<i>This isn't like before.</i>

905
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:34,808
There's something
I must discuss
with you urgently.

906
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:40,213
Please.
It's of a legal nature.

907
01:33:40,215 --> 01:33:42,816
Very well.
Wait for me outside.

908
01:33:57,331 --> 01:33:58,865
I want you to grow
a pointed beard

909
01:33:58,867 --> 01:34:00,900
like the Duke
of Normandy.

910
01:34:00,902 --> 01:34:03,069
What is
the legal matter?

911
01:34:03,071 --> 01:34:05,739
Let's buy you
a new suit today.
All black.

912
01:34:05,741 --> 01:34:08,208
N-no.
I don't want to,

913
01:34:08,210 --> 01:34:10,910
and more importantly,
I can't afford one.

914
01:34:10,912 --> 01:34:12,979
How you care
for your money.

915
01:34:12,981 --> 01:34:15,115
Yes, I do.
Very much.

916
01:34:15,117 --> 01:34:19,219
Now, what is the legal
matter you wanted
to speak of?

917
01:34:19,221 --> 01:34:20,920
Marriage.

918
01:34:20,922 --> 01:34:22,088
Marriage?

919
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:23,990
Yes.

920
01:34:23,992 --> 01:34:25,925
You are married, Emma.

921
01:34:25,927 --> 01:34:26,960
Exactly.

922
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:36,836
You are going
to leave me too, aren't you?

923
01:34:36,838 --> 01:34:38,204
You will marry
someone else.

924
01:34:38,206 --> 01:34:40,707
You'll be
like all the others.

925
01:34:40,709 --> 01:34:43,777
Like what others?
Emma, like what others?

926
01:34:43,779 --> 01:34:45,278
Like all men.
Which men?

927
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,147
You are all evil,
every one of you.

928
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:52,285
I cannot
accompany you.

929
01:34:52,287 --> 01:34:54,054
Leon, please.

930
01:34:54,056 --> 01:34:56,089
I will meet you
at the hotel tonight.

931
01:34:56,091 --> 01:34:57,390
Please go.

932
01:35:51,112 --> 01:35:52,412
Leon!

933
01:35:52,414 --> 01:35:54,147
You must stop
doing this.

934
01:35:54,149 --> 01:35:55,709
But you never came!
I must speak to you!

935
01:36:02,189 --> 01:36:03,490
<i>Do you know
what you're doing to me?</i>

936
01:36:03,492 --> 01:36:05,425
These visits?

937
01:36:05,427 --> 01:36:07,060
Every day,
I must reckon
with my companions

938
01:36:07,062 --> 01:36:08,862
making jokes about me.

939
01:36:08,864 --> 01:36:11,064
You twit!

940
01:36:11,066 --> 01:36:12,899
You worry
about your fellow clerks
making jokes about you?

941
01:36:12,901 --> 01:36:16,202
Do you not love me?

942
01:36:16,204 --> 01:36:18,338
Do you not love me?
<i>Leon!</i>

943
01:36:20,274 --> 01:36:22,408
This is
of absolute reproach.

944
01:36:22,410 --> 01:36:26,079
You are ruining yourself
with a married woman.

945
01:36:26,081 --> 01:36:28,548
<i>Dismiss her at once
or you will be dismissed.</i>

946
01:36:28,550 --> 01:36:30,416
Yes.
She's just leaving, sir.

947
01:37:46,594 --> 01:37:50,063
Who was that?

948
01:37:50,065 --> 01:37:51,264
What have you done?

949
01:37:51,266 --> 01:37:53,066
Who was that?

950
01:37:53,068 --> 01:37:55,001
The bailiff.

951
01:37:55,003 --> 01:37:59,272
No. No, no,
that can't be.

952
01:37:59,274 --> 01:38:00,514
That's all wrong.

953
01:38:11,952 --> 01:38:13,453
Monsieur Lheureux,

954
01:38:13,455 --> 01:38:15,321
there's been
some kind of mistake.

955
01:38:15,323 --> 01:38:17,123
A bailiff has just left
my house with an order

956
01:38:17,125 --> 01:38:19,092
to collect everything
within 14 days!

957
01:38:21,362 --> 01:38:23,930
Did you not
hear me?

958
01:38:25,333 --> 01:38:28,968
A judgment
and a restraint.

959
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:30,937
Yes.
You must fix this.

960
01:38:30,939 --> 01:38:32,538
I'm afraid I can't.
I was pressed for capital

961
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:34,340
and had to pass
on your debts
to a creditor

962
01:38:34,342 --> 01:38:37,076
<i>in Rouen,
a Monsieur Vinçart.</i>

963
01:38:37,078 --> 01:38:39,178
But you made
a promise!

964
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:41,147
I was being bled myself.
The knife was at my throat.

965
01:38:41,149 --> 01:38:43,216
You simply have
too many bills.

966
01:38:43,218 --> 01:38:45,018
One gets in quite
a muddle over them.

967
01:38:45,020 --> 01:38:46,386
But surely,
good Monsieur Lheureux,

968
01:38:46,388 --> 01:38:48,054
you can talk
to Monsieur Vinçart

969
01:38:48,056 --> 01:38:50,056
and quiet him.
<i>Quiet Vinçart?</i>

970
01:38:50,058 --> 01:38:54,294
You don't know him.
He's more ferocious
than a bear.

971
01:38:54,296 --> 01:38:56,396
You could try
the Marquis.

972
01:38:56,398 --> 01:38:59,632
The Marquis?
Yes, I hear he's back
from his sojourn.

973
01:38:59,634 --> 01:39:01,701
Now, if you may,

974
01:39:01,703 --> 01:39:03,569
I must send
these parcels
out at once.

975
01:39:52,453 --> 01:39:54,620
Madame Bovary?

976
01:39:54,622 --> 01:39:56,222
Are you here
to pay alms?

977
01:39:58,092 --> 01:40:00,193
No, Monsieur l'Abbé.

978
01:40:00,195 --> 01:40:03,229
To confess?

979
01:40:03,231 --> 01:40:06,065
No.

980
01:40:06,067 --> 01:40:07,500
To seek counsel?

981
01:40:07,502 --> 01:40:10,036
No.

982
01:40:10,038 --> 01:40:11,637
Just silence.

983
01:40:15,075 --> 01:40:17,577
Have you tried
a walk in the forest?

984
01:40:17,579 --> 01:40:19,379
It never is
absolutely quiet,

985
01:40:19,381 --> 01:40:23,049
but I believe
one can find

986
01:40:23,051 --> 01:40:25,385
great silence
in the sounds of nature.

987
01:41:40,294 --> 01:41:43,196
<i>Good afternoon, Madame.</i>

988
01:41:43,198 --> 01:41:45,358
Charming.
Very pretty room.

989
01:41:55,542 --> 01:41:57,343
Ah, correspondence.

990
01:41:59,179 --> 01:42:00,746
Allow me.

991
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:09,640
Must make sure
you're not hiding
any gold coins.

992
01:42:37,851 --> 01:42:39,585
Sir.
Madame Bovary.

993
01:42:45,659 --> 01:42:48,227
You haven't changed
a bit.

994
01:42:48,229 --> 01:42:49,509
You're still
as charming as ever.

995
01:42:56,537 --> 01:42:59,539
They are poor charms
since you disdained them.

996
01:43:09,917 --> 01:43:11,651
What do you want?

997
01:43:11,653 --> 01:43:15,821
I am ruined.

998
01:43:15,823 --> 01:43:18,291
I need
10,000 francs.

999
01:43:18,293 --> 01:43:20,960
<i>Ten thousand francs?</i>

1000
01:43:20,962 --> 01:43:24,263
My husband borrowed
against our home.

1001
01:43:24,265 --> 01:43:25,865
We shall have
the money soon,

1002
01:43:25,867 --> 01:43:27,400
but today for want
of just 10,000 francs,

1003
01:43:27,402 --> 01:43:30,369
we are to be sold off.

1004
01:43:30,371 --> 01:43:33,673
I do not have
the money that you need.

1005
01:43:33,675 --> 01:43:35,241
You don't?

1006
01:43:35,243 --> 01:43:39,712
<i>I'm struggling myself.</i>

1007
01:43:39,714 --> 01:43:41,554
I pity you
very much.

1008
01:43:45,252 --> 01:43:47,853
<i>The least of these trifles
could get you the money.</i>

1009
01:43:47,855 --> 01:43:50,690
You want for nothing.

1010
01:43:50,692 --> 01:43:53,926
I don't have the money
that you need.

1011
01:43:56,496 --> 01:43:59,532
You made me believe
that you loved me!

1012
01:43:59,534 --> 01:44:01,974
For months, you held me
in the sweetest dream!

1013
01:44:07,774 --> 01:44:10,409
Do you remember
your letter?

1014
01:44:10,411 --> 01:44:11,944
It tore my heart,

1015
01:44:11,946 --> 01:44:14,780
and still I come
back to implore you.

1016
01:44:14,782 --> 01:44:16,015
But you just
look through me,

1017
01:44:16,017 --> 01:44:17,750
and disdain me again?

1018
01:44:22,656 --> 01:44:24,991
I do not have the money
that you need.

1019
01:45:01,461 --> 01:45:03,829
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1020
01:45:03,831 --> 01:45:05,464
What on earth
are you doing?

1021
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:11,804
You put those back.

1022
01:45:11,806 --> 01:45:13,039
They're not yours
to give.

1023
01:45:17,711 --> 01:45:19,612
Emma.

1024
01:45:19,614 --> 01:45:21,080
Emma!

1025
01:45:42,969 --> 01:45:44,470
That can't be it.

1026
01:45:44,472 --> 01:45:45,472
It is.

1027
01:45:59,886 --> 01:46:03,456
Surely this is enough
for an extension?
No.

1028
01:46:03,458 --> 01:46:04,857
And with my piano?
<i>It's too late.</i>

1029
01:46:04,859 --> 01:46:06,625
<i>There's no way out.</i>

1030
01:46:06,627 --> 01:46:08,127
<i>The court
has made its judgment.</i>

1031
01:46:08,129 --> 01:46:09,695
Did you think, little lady,
that I would be

1032
01:46:09,697 --> 01:46:11,797
your supplier
and your banker

1033
01:46:11,799 --> 01:46:14,767
until the end of time,
just for the love of God?

1034
01:46:14,769 --> 01:46:17,737
But the amount
is far too much! I...
<i>And whose fault</i>
<i>is that?</i>

1035
01:46:17,739 --> 01:46:19,805
While I'm slaving
away in here,

1036
01:46:19,807 --> 01:46:22,541
you're gadding about!

1037
01:46:22,543 --> 01:46:24,410
And I'm the one
with the fickle heart?

1038
01:46:24,412 --> 01:46:27,713
Not a sermon, please!

1039
01:46:27,715 --> 01:46:29,081
It never does
any harm.

1040
01:46:29,083 --> 01:46:30,750
You are a wretch!

1041
01:46:34,688 --> 01:46:36,155
<i>Such a little hothead.</i>

1042
01:46:40,394 --> 01:46:43,729
I know
it's not very pleasant.

1043
01:46:43,731 --> 01:46:46,399
I'm aware of that.

1044
01:46:46,401 --> 01:46:48,534
But it never killed
anyone, did it?

1045
01:46:48,536 --> 01:46:52,538
And it's the only way
for you to pay me back.

1046
01:46:52,540 --> 01:46:54,573
But could you not lend
me just a...?

1047
01:46:54,575 --> 01:46:56,642
None whatsoever.

1048
01:47:13,126 --> 01:47:14,527
Mm.

1049
01:47:25,972 --> 01:47:29,942
You have been
an excellent patron.

1050
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:32,545
And I have done
very well by you.

1051
01:47:36,783 --> 01:47:37,917
But in this state,

1052
01:47:37,919 --> 01:47:39,485
I do not see value

1053
01:47:39,487 --> 01:47:41,086
in this proposition!

1054
01:48:18,658 --> 01:48:20,059
Madame?

1055
01:48:23,864 --> 01:48:24,864
Madame?

1056
01:51:15,669 --> 01:51:18,871
<i>Mme. Bovary!</i>

1057
01:51:18,873 --> 01:51:19,905
Emma!

1058
01:51:24,978 --> 01:51:26,011
Emma!

1059
01:51:30,784 --> 01:51:31,884
<i>Mme. Bovary!</i>

1060
01:51:36,389 --> 01:51:37,756
Emma!

1061
01:51:39,859 --> 01:51:41,026
Emma!

1062
01:51:45,265 --> 01:51:46,799
Emma!
