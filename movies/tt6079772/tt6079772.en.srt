00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:33,397
1991 DA NANG, VIETNAM

4
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:15,809
<i>Hello, did you do all of this?</i>

5
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,760
Beretta 93

6
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,480
Usually dependable.

7
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,560
We should be good to go now.

8
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,240
<i>Come on.</i>

9
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,560
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

10
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:33,149
THIRTY YEARS LATER
BUCHAREST, ROMANIA

11
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,560
<i>What the fuck? Are you having a party?</i>

12
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,440
<i>Where is Anton?</i>

13
00:04:08,692 --> 00:04:10,141
<i>Why didn't he answer the phone?</i>

14
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,840
<i>Vali!</i>

15
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,585
<i>Your father is looking for you.</i>

16
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,520
<i>Get up!</i>

17
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,320
<i>Get up, Vali!</i>

18
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,399
<i>Come on, girls, come on. Go home.</i>

19
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,120
<i>Away, away!
Come on, get out of here.</i>

20
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,920
<i>Come on Vali, let's go.</i>

21
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,960
<i>Anton?</i>

22
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,159
<i>Where the fuck is Vali?</i>

23
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,200
<i>You had to look over him,
where the fuck is Vali?</i>

24
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,560
<i>Yes?</i>

25
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,440
<i>Who's talking?</i>

26
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,520
<i>It's me, Vali.</i>

27
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,159
<i>Vali?</i>

28
00:04:45,338 --> 00:04:47,472
<i>Explain to me where did you go?
Why don't you--</i>

29
00:04:47,523 --> 00:04:49,998
<i>Some assholes kidnapped me
outside the hotel.</i>

30
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,339
<i>What? Who?</i>

31
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,760
<i>Who kidnapped you?</i>

32
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,040
<i>How they fuck would I know?</i>

33
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,040
<i>They want three million euros now.</i>

34
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,306
<i>Vali, tell them how I am.</i>

35
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,200
<i>They don't fucking care
who you are, just pay!</i>

36
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,629
<i>They want three million euros
in two hours.</i>

37
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:06,244
<i>Or they'll cut my throat like a pig.</i>

38
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,200
How dare you take my boy?

39
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,120
There it is. You wanna count it?

40
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,080
Do you know who I am?

41
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Don Preda.

42
00:07:25,302 --> 00:07:27,680
Butcher of Bucharest, Killer of Men.

43
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,520
Tell your boss it's done.

44
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,760
Exactly, who are you people?

45
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,080
We're just--

46
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,680
We just find people
who can't be found.

47
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,159
The money.

48
00:07:46,044 --> 00:07:47,878
You gonna have it maybe for an hour.

49
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,400
Then we come take it back, cut you both
into pieces and feed you to my pigs.

50
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,480
That doesn't worry you?

51
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,400
No.

52
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,120
Why?

53
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,000
I didn't come here for money.

54
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,560
I came here for you.

55
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,360
<i>Stop the girl. She killed
Don Preda. Kill her.</i>

56
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,680
Why are you fighting so hard, huh?

57
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,160
You're going home, motherfucker.
Fuck off!

58
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,040
I'm good.

59
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,760
<i>You fucking pieces of shit.
You can't leave me here!</i>

60
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,400
<i>Fuck you, you bastards!</i>

61
00:09:45,311 --> 00:09:46,482
Did you take any, huh?

62
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:47,757
Take what?

63
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,000
Money.

64
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,539
It was all there, right?

65
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,120
We were paid to eliminate
the target. We did that.

66
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:56,760
Yeah, you know, three mil…
dirty money… nobody's looking for…

67
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,960
Just saying.

68
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,280
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't know you're hurting.

69
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,880
Please.

70
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,120
This is R & D Plumbing.
Your leak has been fixed.

71
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,600
Please remit the balance
of your payment for the withd--

72
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,713
<i>€7,000,000. Transfer complete.</i>

73
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,440
Done.

74
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:21,960
You need to see a doctor about that cough.

75
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,640
Traditional or a witch?

76
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,840
You? Definitely a witch.

77
00:10:26,256 --> 00:10:28,200
Ah, I know just the voodoo queen to call.

78
00:10:36,518 --> 00:10:38,493
LONDON

79
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,040
Chelmsford was a bloody war zone.

80
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,258
Every train was 30 minutes late
and jam-packed as always.

81
00:12:25,582 --> 00:12:26,601
Welcome back.

82
00:12:26,654 --> 00:12:28,133
Thank you for taking care of her,

83
00:12:28,157 --> 00:12:30,439
you know you're the only one
she'll tolerate, right?

84
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,397
She gets really mean when you're away.

85
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:35,325
Spent most of the time
hanging out with Proust.

86
00:12:35,425 --> 00:12:36,198
Is that true?

87
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,400
Three weeks, and this
is all you come back with?

88
00:12:38,473 --> 00:12:39,402
Ah, you know sellers,

89
00:12:39,502 --> 00:12:42,167
they know you've come all that way,
and they play hard to get.

90
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:44,000
Didn't you wanna
just kill people like that?

91
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,920
What do you think you're doing, huh?

92
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,680
So, the other day, he says to me
"70 is the new 30."

93
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,673
Well, that's just something old guys say.

94
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,125
How is he doing with his protocol?
Is he following the doctor's orders?

95
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,310
More like, following his own orders.

96
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,600
Happy birth--

97
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,280
No more fucking birthdays.

98
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,000
Take birthdays and shove them up your ass.

99
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,720
Bastard.

100
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,120
What a wonderful toy!

101
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,400
You skimped on the candles I see.

102
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,880
Seventy would have been a fire hazard.

103
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,980
Could you make us some tea please?

104
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,080
Sure.

105
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,489
All right, make your wish.

106
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,440
Happy birthday.

107
00:14:43,153 --> 00:14:43,988
Yeah.

108
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,200
To thank you.

109
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,920
A 1958 Gibson Flying V.

110
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,160
This was in production just two years.

111
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,920
There is only 90 in the whole world.

112
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,040
I know.

113
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,160
That sound…

114
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,960
It's the wood.

115
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,480
African limba.

116
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,960
Nothing else sounds like it.

117
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,440
I was just about giving up hope
on finding one.

118
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:43,551
How in the world did you…

119
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,240
You.

120
00:15:44,912 --> 00:15:47,472
You taught me how to find things
that didn't wanna be found.

121
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,520
Albert King played one.

122
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,280
Albert King played that one.

123
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,120
No!

124
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,640
No!

125
00:16:00,288 --> 00:16:01,917
You're gonna cry now, aren't you?

126
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,800
Only because I can't play it the way
it needs to be played.

127
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,840
Thank you.

128
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,683
One of the twins called me
last night, said she was pregnant.

129
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,080
Daisy in Dover?

130
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,720
No, Daisy in Manchester.

131
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,360
Daisy in Dover is a dyke.

132
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,811
It is a rare gift to have a friend
who trusts you enough

133
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,640
not to try and help until you ask.

134
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:58,939
If you fell in the pond
with those you'd drown.

135
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,023
Well, if I fell in a pond without them
I would probably float away.

136
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,880
-Hi, honey.
-Mind your fingers.

137
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,760
That hefa bites.

138
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,359
She's a baby and doesn't know any better.

139
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,599
There.

140
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,000
You have your own secret hideout.

141
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,160
Why am I not surprised?

142
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,640
I bought the building.

143
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,120
-What?
-The bookstore.

144
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,960
It's yours. Free and clear.

145
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,920
You didn't have to do that.

146
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,560
I know, but it's your passion.

147
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,155
And, it makes me feel good to know

148
00:17:51,255 --> 00:17:53,807
you'll have something
to work on while I'm gone.

149
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,280
What is that?

150
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,560
Those are the souls
waiting for me on the other side.

151
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,960
I'm sure they have a reception planned.

152
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,360
Ah… sent away so many prematurely.

153
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,960
Either by my hand or through you.

154
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,038
We never sent anyone away
who didn't have it coming.

155
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,920
Maybe.

156
00:18:17,952 --> 00:18:21,405
But… I'm sure there are
quite a few spirits up there

157
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,400
waiting for me with a bone to pick.

158
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:27,711
You really believe you're going up?

159
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,600
Don't you?

160
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,080
Lucas Hayes.

161
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,840
I need our friend to find him for me.

162
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,240
I have him up till 1998, Paris,
after that nothing.

163
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,560
-Just find?
-Just find.

164
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,960
Discreetly, and with the quickness.

165
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,160
Okay.

166
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,320
I may have to go back to Vietnam.

167
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,403
It'd be nice if you went with me.

168
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,546
I'm never going back there.

169
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,115
Our past is never
where we left it, little chameleon.

170
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,920
We all have scars.

171
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,200
You stare at them long enough
you remember how you got them.

172
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,760
-Hi.
-Morning.

173
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,124
The blue dress has a small tear in it,
I was hoping to talk to Benny about it.

174
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:20,066
What do you think?

175
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,400
Of what?

176
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,440
My, mustache.

177
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,760
Oh, you know, I don't have
my contacts in, sorry.

178
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,640
Funny.

179
00:20:33,072 --> 00:20:36,872
You wait till this grows in
women like you are gonna be so…

180
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,920
No, it's okay. I'll help you out.

181
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,400
I need you to find this guy.

182
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,360
What? No satellite shots of a
mafia compound outside Bucharest?

183
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,400
No, but that was
some of your better work.

184
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,640
Moody wants this guy, Lucas Hayes,
last seen in Paris in '98 and then nothing.

185
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:52,960
Yeah.

186
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,022
I'll be with you in a second.

187
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,960
Can I help you?

188
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,850
Yeah, I'm looking for a book,
an old book. Like, rare.

189
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,560
-"Like rare"?
-Yeah.

190
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:11,099
Either they are or they aren't.

191
00:21:11,123 --> 00:21:14,055
Books aren't like stake,
you can't get them like medium rare.

192
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,600
-It's funny.
-Sarcastic.

193
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,840
Yes, but funny.

194
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:22,320
Listen, my boss' wife is having a party
and she collects books, first editions.

195
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:23,400
Any particular subject?

196
00:21:23,425 --> 00:21:25,625
Birds. It's Audobon's…

197
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,600
"Birds of America"?

198
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,080
Yeah, that's it.
He said she's looking for a copy.

199
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,480
-A first edition?
-Yeah.

200
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,320
-Sorry.
-You don't have it?

201
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:34,210
No one does,
only one first editions exists,

202
00:21:34,235 --> 00:21:37,760
it was sold to a private buyer
in 1991 for a 9.6 million dollars.

203
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,640
Wow, okay.

204
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,480
Well, looks like I'm out of luck.

205
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,960
All right. What do you think?
Maybe poetry?

206
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,647
Hang on…

207
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,920
It'll be the hit of the party.

208
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,001
TAMERLANE AND OTHER POEMS

209
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,960
I don't-- I don't know this one.

210
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,600
It's Edgar Allan Poe actually.

211
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,440
His first collection of poems
published anonymously.

212
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,627
You think she might have it?

213
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:10,080
Doubtful. Only 50 copies were printed.
Only 12 are known to exist.

214
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,200
How much?

215
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,680
I can give it to you for $265,000.

216
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,880
Perhaps a bracelet instead?

217
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,440
She does have exquisite wrists, good idea.

218
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:31,971
Is there something else?

219
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,360
I find you interesting.

220
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,360
-You mean--
-You're interesting.

221
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,620
Beautiful, sure, not in that
ornamental kind of way.

222
00:22:38,722 --> 00:22:40,920
It's the interesting part
that got me wondering,

223
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Wondering what?

224
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,080
How long after I give you
my number will it take you

225
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,680
to decide that I'm just
as interesting and give me a call?

226
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,240
Twenty seven minutes.

227
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,360
That long?

228
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,320
First I have to pretend to cancel my date
and then I have to feed my cat.

229
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,440
That's six.

230
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,714
The rest is me playing hard to get.

231
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:07,535
Cute.

232
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,120
How many of these are you
carrying around, Mr…

233
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,240
Rembrandt. Michael Rembrandt.

234
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,360
Actually, I haven't had an occasion
to use one until just now.

235
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,480
So…

236
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,120
Interesting.

237
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:34,011
"There rose a fountain once, and there
full many a fair flower raised its head."

238
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,880
That was from the book, wasn't it.

239
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,041
"But she who rear'd them was long dead,
And in such follies had no part."

240
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,520
You almost got me on this one.

241
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,240
You didn't say I'd be tracking
an eight year old.

242
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,498
Lucas Hayes did arrive in Paris in '98,
but returned to Da Nang, March '99.

243
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,600
Everything else I have is on there.

244
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,958
B. B. KING
LIVE AT THE VILLAGE GATE

245
00:27:06,536 --> 00:27:08,566
READY TO GO

246
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,960
Benny?

247
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,240
You'll stay up
until I get there, 45 minutes.

248
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:22,200
Lucas Hayes, born April 5, 1990.

249
00:30:23,453 --> 00:30:25,554
Father: Edward Hayes.
Mother: Mary Christian.

250
00:30:33,382 --> 00:30:34,716
St. Quiteria Hospital

251
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:37,376
Lucas Hayes, admitted
to St Quiteria Hospital on June 2nd, 1999.

252
00:30:40,103 --> 00:30:43,453
Father: Edward Hayes, assassinated
at Christmas Day, 1991. No other records.

253
00:31:09,283 --> 00:31:11,879
Edward Arthur Hayes

254
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:17,245
Businessman indicted for war crimes
dies in car bomb attack.

255
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,330
Edward Hayes… was killed
in a car explosion in Da Nang yesterday.

256
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:28,680
Moody.

257
00:31:32,615 --> 00:31:34,258
"Company will continue," vows CEO

258
00:31:34,315 --> 00:31:36,015
"Edward Hayes
was my partner for 25 years.

259
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,561
I will continue to steer our company
as he would have wanted me to."

260
00:31:42,113 --> 00:31:45,020
Jossino Vohl

261
00:32:04,426 --> 00:32:06,529
DA NANG, VIETNAM

262
00:34:07,043 --> 00:34:08,668
Shit! What the fuck is that?

263
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,960
Fuck.

264
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,360
<i>Honey! Come on.</i>

265
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,440
Never thought I'd see you here again.

266
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,807
Well, maybe you're not seeing me now.

267
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,880
Who's the bitch?

268
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,840
Billy Boy…

269
00:35:02,003 --> 00:35:04,800
I know you run with all kinds
but now you're running with stupid?

270
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,541
Fuck you!

271
00:35:05,576 --> 00:35:09,246
Hey! Go get a drink, sugar,
and give the adults some privacy, huh?

272
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,440
Beers!

273
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,960
Is that your ride outside?

274
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,000
Yours now.

275
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,640
It ain't my birthday.

276
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,600
Jossino Vohl.

277
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,640
How's Moody?

278
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,280
He's dead.

279
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,040
For Moody.

280
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,320
Vohl involved?

281
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,160
I don't know. But he knows who is.

282
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,800
-He's gonna be hard to kill.
-I just wanna talk to him.

283
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,320
Steverino!

284
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,320
Yeah, Boss?

285
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,320
You work security at the State Tower.

286
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,040
My friend there needs
a few minutes with Vohl.

287
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,920
Alone.

288
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,850
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

289
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:09,458
He goes nowhere without private security.

290
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,960
The guy's never alone.

291
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,240
<i>What is happening?</i>

292
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,960
This is how easy it is
for me to get to you, Mr. Vohl.

293
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,600
Do you understand?

294
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,560
You were friends and business
partners with Edward Hayes,

295
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,960
so you would know most
about his short but interesting life.

296
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,320
Good, cause I have questions.

297
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,173
You give me answers:
if I'm satisfied you'll never see me again,

298
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,291
if I'm not, I'll be
the last thing you'll ever see.

299
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,160
I look forward to hearing from you.

300
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,960
<i>Good evening, Miss.</i>

301
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,040
<i>It's been a long time since such
a beautiful young woman gave me her number.</i>

302
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,840
You know who I am.

303
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,960
Jossino Vohl, born in April, 1945.

304
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,120
French national,
residing full time in Vietnam.

305
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,720
Was in business with Edward Hayes
until his untimely death.

306
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,440
Now you're a top political power broker
with some interesting side hobbies.

307
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,480
I see you're familiar with my resume.

308
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,275
I am not interested
in your business activities, Mr. Vohl.

309
00:38:53,393 --> 00:38:55,480
I want to talk
about your friend's son, Lucas.

310
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,640
My office, one hour.

311
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,720
We'll be alone?

312
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,960
<i>My lawyer will be present.</i>

313
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,680
That would be the man
standing behind you pouring a scotch?

314
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,200
<i>Delighted, Miss.</i>

315
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,240
Exactly on time.

316
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,760
Please.

317
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,640
Monsieur Duquet,
my personal attorney.

318
00:40:07,137 --> 00:40:09,706
-Would you like some champagne?
-Edward Arthur Hayes.

319
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,480
Eddie and I were involved
in a bauxite mining project together

320
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,560
until his accident.

321
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,360
It wasn't an accident,
it was an assassination.

322
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,720
We were useful.

323
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,320
The country was malleable,
ripe for certain business practices.

324
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,240
Eddie was juggling
a lot of delicate plates.

325
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,840
What's your interest in a man
who's been dead almost thirty years?

326
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,080
I'm interested in his son.

327
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,080
Lucas Hayes.

328
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,200
I'm sorry?

329
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,669
Three people are dead
because they inquired about him.

330
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,200
He had them killed
and I'm going to find him.

331
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,802
Should I be talking to him?

332
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,360
I have no connection with Lucas Hayes.

333
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,320
And what does any of this
got to do with me?

334
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,920
I was wondering the same thing.

335
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,920
Mr. Vohl's past relationships
are no one's concern.

336
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,000
And certainly none of yours.

337
00:41:10,076 --> 00:41:11,377
Oh, I've made them my concern.

338
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,040
Too bad.

339
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,960
I need to know everything.

340
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,080
Who are you?

341
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,600
Who hired you?

342
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,600
Why the interest in Lucas Hayes?

343
00:41:56,082 --> 00:41:57,884
We can do this another way if you'd like.

344
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,400
Fucking let me go!

345
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,480
Get up there.

346
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,200
Hand me a gun.

347
00:42:31,657 --> 00:42:32,782
SPRINKLER VALVE

348
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,922
Where the fuck do you think you're going?

349
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,040
Say it.

350
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,480
Fuck you!

351
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,200
Say it!

352
00:43:53,295 --> 00:43:54,644
<i>She's down there!</i>

353
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,659
Let's start with your name.

354
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,240
Why was Moody looking
for Edward Hayes' son?

355
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,280
Who else out there
should we know about?

356
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,040
Fuck!

357
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,400
Anyone ever last this long.

358
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,960
It's out of our hands now, anyway.

359
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:23,520
Him?

360
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,520
That was a long 27 minutes.

361
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,466
I'm still waiting for your call.

362
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,330
It's all right.

363
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,398
I don't take these things personally.

364
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:46,840
Bone broth.

365
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,720
Helps with inflammation and bruising.

366
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,400
Here.

367
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,994
Careful. It's hot. Watch it.

368
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,040
There you go.

369
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:00,720
I like this myself.

370
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,960
Here you go, small sips.

371
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:08,800
Good?

372
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,354
Not gonna lie to you,

373
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,120
there's not much of a chance
this ends well for you.

374
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,480
That guy out there.

375
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,440
We work for the same individual.

376
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,440
Boss has a problem.
He calls him, he takes care of it.

377
00:47:27,195 --> 00:47:30,280
Little heavy handed for my taste
but that's not my call.

378
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,200
I'm sorry about your friend, Moody.

379
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,280
I had no part in that.

380
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,280
Or the fire fight at the bookstore.

381
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,040
I'm an after-the-facts guy.

382
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,720
I come in to make sure
there's no loose ends.

383
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,720
I look for things that might
seem benign, but aren't.

384
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,920
Like a bookstore run by an assassin,
boy, I never saw that one coming.

385
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,480
I misread you completely.

386
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,418
I can help you out of here.

387
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,514
Okay?

388
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,588
But you have to help me.

389
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,160
I'm your last line of defense.

390
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,080
End of the road, no more lifelines.

391
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,240
You understand?

392
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,520
All right.

393
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,360
You forgot to blanch the bones.

394
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:28,840
Your soup.

395
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,840
You have to blanch the bones
before you roast them.

396
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,400
Locks the minerals in,
it's better for healing.

397
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,387
You got anything out of her?

398
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,600
Yes and no.

399
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,046
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

400
00:48:58,109 --> 00:49:00,398
Means I'll be back in the morning
to follow up with her.

401
00:49:00,427 --> 00:49:02,486
-I don't need you here, Rembrandt.
-Well…

402
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,640
the man who signs the checks
thought differently.

403
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,672
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

404
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:06,880
And why is that?

405
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,560
Oh, I don't know.

406
00:49:08,774 --> 00:49:11,480
Maybe it's because you killed Vohl
without asking his permission.

407
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,760
Vohl knew everything,
he was a direct connection.

408
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,440
Would've folded like a tent.

409
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:20,000
You… yes, kill me, you're all the same:
shoot first and ask questions later.

410
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,287
And hold off on those
enhanced interrogation techniques.

411
00:49:23,545 --> 00:49:25,433
I want her clear-headed in the morning.

412
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,680
He'll break her tomorrow.

413
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,600
Maybe he broke her already.

414
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:38,229
The old man is desperate
to know what she knows.

415
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:44,804
I wonder how it'd feel if his boy wonder
ends up killing her before he finds out.

416
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,040
I'm guessing he'll look
for a new boy wonder.

417
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,913
Just when we were getting
to know each other.

418
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,360
I've got teams at the airport,
shipyard and train station.

419
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,360
She's not gonna run, she's gonna lick
her wounds. Then she's coming after you.

420
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,760
Good.

421
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,280
Really?

422
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,440
Cause right now it's 4:0. She's wining.

423
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,000
Where do you buy your suits?

424
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,280
Cause I've got a cousin as big and tall

425
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,760
and he's a hard time.

426
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:19,840
Nobody's home.

427
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,280
Well, I can get you to the border.

428
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,200
London may not be safe
for you right now.

429
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,320
This is Vietnam, Anna,

430
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,720
you know what's it like here.

431
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,120
You owe it to Moody to stay alive.

432
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,840
I know what I owe him.

433
00:52:55,019 --> 00:52:56,141
<i>Go.</i>

434
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,444
The fuck you think
I gave you the money fo--

435
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,480
End of the line, kid.

436
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,080
Get in!

437
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,280
Watch out!

438
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:35,000
Moody was beautiful,

439
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,760
in his way.

440
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,250
He was kind.

441
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,320
And not through effort,
it was just a part of who he was.

442
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,880
He didn't save my life,
he gave me a life.

443
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,186
He knew who I was, what I've become.

444
00:53:55,494 --> 00:53:57,720
And he protected me.

445
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,280
Hayes has been dead for thirty years,

446
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,680
Vohl was gone longer.

447
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,040
You've got some very bad people
looking for you.

448
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,400
Lucas Hayes killed Moody,
he knows I'm looking for him.

449
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,400
His last known location
is St. Quiteria Hospital.

450
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,640
Nobody is as deaf as those
who don't wanna listen.

451
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,520
<i>Hello, Ms. Nguyen.</i>

452
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:39,229
It's been some time since we've had
a visit from the Ministry of Health.

453
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,200
And to request records
from that far back…

454
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,289
Yes, I know.

455
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:44,799
We're hoping to find something
in there that will help us

456
00:55:44,867 --> 00:55:48,091
rule out environmental factors,
cause we are in the midst of a study.

457
00:55:48,137 --> 00:55:48,746
Thank you.

458
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,840
Lucas Hayes, well before my time here.

459
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,399
2 5 8 5 0 2 4 5 8 6.

460
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,600
<i>Copy, I'll get Doc on it.</i>

461
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,400
Okay.

462
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,600
<i>Doc came through, pulled his records.</i>

463
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:23,560
And?

464
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:29,360
<i>Sit down: Lucas Hayes was admitted
to St. Quiteria on 2nd June, 1999,</i>

465
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,479
<i>and according to his records never left.</i>

466
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:37,400
I apologize, seems the boy was
re-admitted under the name Christian.

467
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,720
Christian, right,
his mother's maiden name.

468
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,440
He was already here when I arrived,

469
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,426
been a patient
for more than twenty years.

470
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,960
He doesn't like to be touched.

471
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,480
He can't speak. Also deaf and blind.

472
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,280
And how long has he been like this?

473
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,200
He was diagnosed when he was six,
I believe, it regressed rapidly.

474
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,720
It's a miracle he's lived as long.

475
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,960
And who pays for his care?

476
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,882
We have a generous endowment.

477
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,280
Everyone here is treated for free.

478
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,720
<i>Wow! Four men dead, nothing on camera.</i>

479
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,280
<i>Place looks like an abattoir.</i>

480
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,360
<i>Was it the food?</i>

481
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,280
You know, it was bad manners.

482
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,129
Yeah, well, that's no way to treat a lady.

483
00:57:25,237 --> 00:57:26,520
I'm no lady.

484
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,138
Not that I was a gentleman myself.

485
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,800
I wouldn't sell yourself short.

486
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,360
<i>Coming from you, that's a compliment.</i>

487
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,320
I'm in the middle of something--

488
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,800
Hey, how were good sisters
of the St. Quiteria?

489
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,997
Good enough to let me know
I've been looking for the wrong person.

490
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:44,960
<i>Good gals out there.</i>

491
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,252
St. Quiteria, do you know who she was?

492
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,960
Fifteen years old, she led a guerrilla war
against the Roman legions.

493
00:57:51,633 --> 00:57:52,218
Bad ass.

494
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:54,400
They chopped off her head
and fed the rest to the dogs.

495
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,040
Again, bad manners.

496
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:59,880
Hey, you up for a dinner? I could answer
some questions and save you some time.

497
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,680
<i>What do say if we say La Cinq?
Tomorrow night, eight o'clock.</i>

498
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,986
I mean you can say it.
But I won't be there.

499
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,520
I'll give you the time and place.

500
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,240
You're intrigued by her.

501
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:14,720
Curious.

502
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,360
Need I worry?

503
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,560
The gala list, sir,
200 guests, all vetted.

504
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,080
The joys of a room full of
the wealthy and the privileged

505
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,440
donating large sums for a noble cause.

506
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,760
Never gets old.

507
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:37,760
Good.

508
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:44,560
Why did you do this?

509
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,919
It's what people in my position
are supposed to do, Michael.

510
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:50,240
Give to the less fortunate.

511
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,520
I asked if I should be worried.

512
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,680
About the woman.

513
00:58:54,937 --> 00:58:57,857
Nope. Not yet.

514
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:01,440
Please wrap up
this unpleasantness by Sunday.

515
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,800
I don't wanna be embarrassed
before the celebration.

516
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:24,960
Wow.

517
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,259
Thank you, Ben.

518
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,520
They know me here.

519
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:35,880
Cheers.

520
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:39,471
Someone killed a friend of mine

521
00:59:39,571 --> 00:59:41,988
because of a contract
he completed years ago.

522
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,520
And anyone I ask about it ends up dead.

523
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,560
Why is that?

524
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:48,360
I don't know, but some people
might take it as a sign.

525
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,612
Why don't you just consider it
a mystery best left unsolved?

526
00:59:51,737 --> 00:59:53,266
But I like mysteries.

527
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:57,800
When I started this I was curios.
And then I went from curious to concerned.

528
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:58,680
And now?

529
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,040
I'm testy.

530
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,040
An trust me, you don't wanna
know me when I'm testy.

531
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,200
HK 9mm.

532
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,600
Very good.

533
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,195
Not from where I'm sitting.

534
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,409
Who's paying for the orphan kid?
I'd like to talk to whoever that is.

535
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,320
That'd be unwise.

536
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:20,560
<i>Unwise</i> is killing a man
who was a second father to me.

537
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,360
We are way past unwise.

538
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,320
This is a really bad place for a hit.

539
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:28,680
High-end restaurant, the security
at every exit, not to mention the cameras.

540
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,040
You know what, you already knew that.

541
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,520
Oh, I'm not here to kill you…

542
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,240
Yet. Just to get answers.

543
01:00:36,661 --> 01:00:37,840
You always ask like this?

544
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:40,480
Yeah, I like to have peoples' attention
when I talk, you know?

545
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:40,960
Well…

546
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:45,480
you certainly have the attention
of the boys down there.

547
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:49,280
Look, you're gonna have to put
at least three in me to be sure.

548
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,120
Four.

549
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,788
Fine. That leaves you with five.
In case there's trouble

550
01:00:52,888 --> 01:00:54,837
You think that's enough
to get you out of here?

551
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:59,160
Four quick shots and then the slow walk
to the exit amongst the chaos. Yeah.

552
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,880
Something unexpected could happen.

553
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,360
You know, it usually does.

554
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,280
SIG 226, it's got that great kick.

555
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,520
Yeah.

556
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:19,840
How about that.
Our first awkward silence.

557
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,960
You know what, I didn't get your name.

558
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:24,800
Anna.

559
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:25,360
Pleasure.

560
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,280
We'll see.

561
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,160
What do you say we forget these tricks.

562
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,520
Let's just go for a nice hotel.

563
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:37,360
You point a gun at my pussy
and then you ask me to bed?

564
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:39,640
I like your style.

565
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,400
Said the woman with hollow-points
pointed at my balls.

566
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:45,855
Well, let's hope this doesn't get messy,
These are my favorite shoes.

567
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,240
Manolo's, classic four inch pumps.

568
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,960
A man who knows Poe and footwear.

569
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,400
Let me put this to you delicately,

570
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,360
you keep this up, you're gonna die.

571
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,120
Vietnam has always been a place of death.

572
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,320
Only lucky ones make it out alive.
I was lucky once.

573
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,760
You don't get lucky twice.

574
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,960
I'm going to find out
who killed my friend.

575
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,200
And when you do?

576
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:16,320
I'm going to end their life,
and anyone standing in my way.

577
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,600
Thank you for a lovely evening.

578
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,200
Hey, I know it sounds crazy,

579
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,880
but I'd really like to see you again

580
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,600
under, you know, different circumstances.

581
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,400
This was personal time.

582
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,280
So these are the best circumstances
you'll ever see me in.

583
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,160
Speak.

584
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,320
Call me when it's done.

585
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,542
I thought you're off
chasing corrupt accountants.

586
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:38,080
I found a hotel room with all
of her shit, including her passport.

587
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,120
Name's Nadia Zhukova.

588
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,320
An Asian Russian.

589
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:43,560
Boy.

590
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,834
You don't really see that ever.

591
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,376
Good work, you must be exhausted, huh?

592
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,480
Looks like I'm a day late.

593
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,400
<i>And a dollar short.
Didn't take much I'm afraid.</i>

594
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,800
He sang like a bird, didn't he?

595
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,800
<i>All of the things I know now.</i>

596
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,120
<i>I know who your boss is,
the man who sanctioned Moody's killing.</i>

597
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,160
He's a big fish.

598
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,040
<i>More fun when you hook him.</i>

599
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,640
Well, then I guess…

600
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:29,080
I guess we'll be seeing
each other real soon then.

601
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:30,960
<i>Sooner than you think.</i>

602
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,560
<i>Hey, what happened to your hand?</i>

603
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:31,880
Make up your mind:

604
01:09:32,639 --> 01:09:35,233
kill me or fuck me?

605
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,712
It's so weird that we're
in this guy's bed while he's…

606
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:51,880
up there.

607
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,200
You know, hanging.

608
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:57,920
No.

609
01:09:58,500 --> 01:09:59,920
Would be a waste of a nice bed.

610
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:01,800
Okay.

611
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,784
How long have you been doing this?

612
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,280
Not, you know, this, but…

613
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,760
Long enough not to miss.

614
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,000
You got lucky.

615
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,440
Nah.

616
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,520
You don't want me dead.

617
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,320
Yet.

618
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,160
Why haven't you killed me?

619
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:24,960
Could you?

620
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:31,415
I could put two in the back of your head
and go make a sandwich.

621
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:34,840
Well.

622
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,600
You always said
this wasn't gonna work out.

623
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:41,040
No.

624
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:45,639
It's been my experience, it never does.
At least not for the other guy.

625
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:47,960
Have a way around that?

626
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:49,840
You are holding all the cards.

627
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,719
I'm watching a woman
who walk over a shark tank

628
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,120
on a tight rope in high winds.

629
01:10:59,559 --> 01:11:01,378
You're not gonna make it, Anna.

630
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,800
He's a bad man.

631
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,040
Who's done very bad things.

632
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,960
So, you just gonna lay there?

633
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,080
Good to see you, kid.

634
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,639
Get in. Get out.

635
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,719
You know you only get lucky once.

636
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:15,120
Yeah. Someone else just told me that.

637
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:15,880
Okay.

638
01:12:18,243 --> 01:12:19,340
God!

639
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:22,199
-Just a little glue. Just a little glue.
-What's wrong with you!

640
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:23,960
It's okay, grit your teeth.

641
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,040
Oh, God.

642
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,760
You know, I still feel
really bad about Claudia.

643
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,800
She couldn't cook worth a shit,
but she didn't deserve to die like that.

644
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,280
Here we go.

645
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:36,840
Okay.

646
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:39,120
Okay, okay. We're done here.

647
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,000
Did you really think
they can kill me that easily?

648
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:57,320
Before I blew the rest of it off he didn't
have much of a face to begin with.

649
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,920
And I left just enough of me
for the authorities to think it was me.

650
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,160
I'm sorry you had
to be the one who found him.

651
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,600
You could always think
on your feet anyway.

652
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,559
Not so much tonight.

653
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,480
That's what friends are for, right?

654
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,120
Oh, good. We're friends again.

655
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:31,520
You got laid, didn't you?

656
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,719
Depending more and more on this shit

657
01:13:45,559 --> 01:13:47,040
to take the edge off.

658
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,920
So, what's the plan?

659
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:00,605
Four hundred acres, to get there

660
01:14:00,705 --> 01:14:03,437
you'd have to hike through 12 miles
of rat-infested jungle.

661
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:07,480
That leaves the river,
cameras, sonar, patrol boats.

662
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,680
Still a pessimistic little shit,
aren't you?

663
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,160
And you're still a cockroach
you can't kill.

664
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:13,920
I mean it in a good way.

665
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,120
They know you're coming.

666
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:19,760
What is this?

667
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:23,840
It's a panic room,
in this case it's a panic bunker.

668
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:27,160
If he gets in there, you're done.

669
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:29,800
All the guests arrive by boat,

670
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,080
they'll be screened
a moment they disembark.

671
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:34,040
Perimeter locked down and site secured.

672
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:38,880
And I've added an additional team
of 16 out of Israel just for the night.

673
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,639
Seems like you got everything covered.

674
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:41,639
Michael.

675
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,080
Thoughts?

676
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:47,440
Venice.

677
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,639
It's really nice this time of year.

678
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,240
You should go. Now.

679
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,400
These guys have no idea
who they're dealing with.

680
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,480
<i>Copy that.</i>

681
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:56,880
You look a little tense.

682
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,680
I've protected everyone
from crowned princes to cartel kingpins.

683
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:05,632
Nothing's gonna happen tonight
especially when we know what she looks like.

684
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,320
Boy…

685
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,840
I really hope you got paid upfront.

686
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:18,360
Sir.

687
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:43,400
Anything?

688
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,487
Nothing so far. Sectors one,
two and three are clear.

689
01:17:46,587 --> 01:17:48,675
I'm waiting on the reports
from sector four.

690
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:32,120
Thank you.

691
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:38,120
It is with great pleasure that I welcome
you all here on this very expensive evening.

692
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:42,639
It warms my crusty heart to look across
the room and see so many familiar faces,

693
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:45,600
dear friends, and close
business associates.

694
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:50,639
As well as quite a few unfamiliar faces
that with luck will not remain so for long.

695
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:54,453
Perhaps I may even have spotted
a few former foes of mine.

696
01:18:55,523 --> 01:18:57,532
I want especially to thank you for coming,

697
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:00,719
and for seeing the error of your ways.

698
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:04,639
Over these considerable years
I've learnt to my great satisfaction

699
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:08,280
there is no better way to cleanse the soul

700
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,639
than to do good,
to perform selfless deeds.

701
01:19:10,639 --> 01:19:14,360
and acts of kindness,
to sacrifice for others,

702
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:17,719
and most importantly to give generously.

703
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,639
It is due to your generous spirit

704
01:19:20,639 --> 01:19:22,920
that we've been able to enrich and enhance

705
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,067
the lives of so many infants,
children, young men and women

706
01:19:26,167 --> 01:19:27,719
in desperate need of care

707
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:32,080
to a degree that would have been impossible
to achieve without every one of you.

708
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:36,920
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for
the privilege of being your host tonight.

709
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:41,480
And for allowing me to slide my hands
into your pockets and purses,

710
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,662
but for a worthy a cause.

711
01:19:44,866 --> 01:19:48,680
The sisters of St. Quiteria
do outstanding work… So…

712
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:51,320
…Give with your heart.

713
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:14,320
You look really good for a man
who's been dead thirty years, Mr. Hayes.

714
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,719
How'd you get in here?

715
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:25,320
Technology.
It just gonna fuck us all one day.

716
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:27,719
Who are you?

717
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:30,191
I'm the big bad wolf that comes to get you

718
01:23:30,291 --> 01:23:33,542
when someone on this Earth
decides your time is up.

719
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:36,800
Moody.

720
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,559
Resurrection is a bitch, ain't it?

721
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:47,280
You've come to finish the job,
haven't you?

722
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:51,680
Well, you did hire me
all those years ago to kill you, right?

723
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,719
Who was really in that car?

724
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:07,280
Does it matter? Disposable asset.
No one of any consequence.

725
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:13,960
You see, that's the kind of shit
I expect someone like you to say.

726
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,559
"No one of any consequence."

727
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:20,080
"Someone like me"?

728
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,680
Man, I can't be all morally right.

729
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:26,280
I kill people for a living,
bad people, mind you, but still.

730
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,800
I never pretend to be anything else.

731
01:24:29,529 --> 01:24:33,960
You, you're front and center
of a dozen high-profile charitable causes.

732
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:38,830
The world sees you as clean
as first fucking snow.

733
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:41,920
But your hands are covered in shit.

734
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:46,719
Blood, everything from from sarin gas
to human trafficking.

735
01:24:48,559 --> 01:24:51,840
So you know why
I had to arrange my demise.

736
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,120
I had a son,

737
01:25:00,559 --> 01:25:02,360
unexpected in many ways.

738
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:05,760
But what I couldn't fathom
was the depths of love

739
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:07,371
I had for this child,

740
01:25:08,291 --> 01:25:11,840
this imperfect, wonderful, vulnerable boy.

741
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:16,880
If I were dead, Lucas would be free
from any threats or harm.

742
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,080
Bullshit.

743
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,559
You may love your son, Mr. Hayes,

744
01:25:22,456 --> 01:25:26,026
but that was your chance to disappear.

745
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,200
You're very astute.

746
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,680
No one looks for a dead man.

747
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:38,680
I was able to continue behind the shroud
of respectability that allowed me to--

748
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:40,559
To become a bigger monster.

749
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:43,559
The irony of all of this, Mr. Hayes,

750
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,760
is that I was just trying
to make amends to your son

751
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,600
for taking his father away from him.

752
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,639
You brought all of this on yourself.

753
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:12,840
Anna.

754
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:24,320
You don't look so good.

755
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:25,600
I don't know.

756
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:30,193
Nothing an Apple Martini
and a liter of AB positive won't fix, huh?

757
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:35,320
Hey, what do you think
the chances are of me getting either?

758
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:36,480
Faint.

759
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:43,920
Something funny?

760
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,840
I find it amusing you think
you're better than me.

761
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:49,680
Not better.

762
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,480
Different.

763
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:58,520
You see, most people are good, Mr. Hayes.

764
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:04,840
Then occasionally they do something
they know is bad.

765
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:09,760
Some people are bad, and they struggle
every day to keep it under control.

766
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:14,960
Others… corrupt to the core and just
don't give a damn, that would be me.

767
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,120
But evil…

768
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:24,600
Evil is a completely different
creature, Mr. Hayes.

769
01:27:25,559 --> 01:27:31,480
Evil believes bad is okay,
its actions are justified.

770
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,840
Violence divorced from conscience,

771
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:37,880
no matter what toll it takes
or who it takes it upon.

772
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:43,040
And there, my friend,
is where we part ways.

773
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:48,680
I'm just a bad man
who's looking to pay for his sins.

774
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:51,760
I see.

775
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:56,160
So you are here to clear
your conscience first then?

776
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,840
You'll never get out of here alive.

777
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,440
I never intended to.

778
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:19,840
One more thing.

779
01:28:21,639 --> 01:28:23,240
You could have killed the old man.

780
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:24,440
Why didn't you?

781
01:28:26,559 --> 01:28:28,080
That wasn't the plan.

782
01:29:15,656 --> 01:29:18,059
ANNA: IT'S BEEN A BLAST.
LOCATION

783
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:52,880
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

784
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:56,880
<i>No! No!</i>

785
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:02,960
<i>No! Mom!</i>

786
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,400
<i>Mom!</i>

787
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:30,280
What took you?

788
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:31,960
Just out for a bite.

789
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:41,760
You just gonna stand there?

790
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:44,520
For now.

791
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:50,320
It doesn't have to be this way, Anna.

792
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:52,320
Not anymore.

793
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:56,240
We all have to pay
for our sins eventually.

794
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:59,040
Doesn't have to be today.

795
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:01,240
I'm tired.

796
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:03,680
I want peace.

797
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:06,719
And I can't have it
while you're out there.

798
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:11,760
What if I told you you could?

799
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:13,520
Yeah?

800
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:17,920
Two in the back of the head,
and then go have a sandwich.

801
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:23,160
You can't buy back your past, Anna,
can't change where you came from,

802
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,392
