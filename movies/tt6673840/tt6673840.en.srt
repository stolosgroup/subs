3
00:01:12,987 --> 00:01:15,153
0-12!

4
00:01:16,278 --> 00:01:18,153
0-12!

5
00:01:20,403 --> 00:01:22,778
This is 0-12.

6
00:01:22,945 --> 00:01:24,695
0-12, why didn't you answer?

7
00:01:26,778 --> 00:01:28,653
My engine is on fire.

8
00:01:28,987 --> 00:01:31,737
Request for permission to activate
the fire extinguishing system.
8th
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,248
Negative!

9
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:35,612
It will turn the engine off immediately!

10
00:01:35,778 --> 00:01:37,070
Roger that.

11
00:01:39,653 --> 00:01:42,361
Drift down to 1000 feet,
aim the plane to the field...

12
00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:44,486
and activate the ejection seat. Copy?

13
00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:45,904
Roger that. I'm drifting down.

14
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,737
Markelov, is the ejector prepared?
Markelov, are you deaf or what?

15
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,695
Did you remove the pin from the ejector?

16
00:02:12,737 --> 00:02:15,486
0-12, Leonov? Why are you doing nothing?

17
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:21,945
Reply! I order you to...

18
00:02:27,862 --> 00:02:30,862
Damn it!
He has shut off the engine.

19
00:02:52,278 --> 00:02:53,570
What the hell...

20
00:02:53,737 --> 00:02:55,653
Drive straight to the runway.
- Yes, sir.

21
00:03:03,737 --> 00:03:07,195
The commission is here.
- Which commission?
- General Kamanin.

22
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:14,570
He's trying to extinguish the fire.

23
00:03:16,653 --> 00:03:19,445
Come on, my little bird! Come on!

24
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:25,486
There we go!

25
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,570
Hold on!

26
00:03:42,778 --> 00:03:44,778
Lyosha!

27
00:04:03,486 --> 00:04:05,111
Markelov...

28
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,278
rascal.

29
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,486
Comrade General, as commander of the
294th Air Reconnaissance Division...
- At ease!

30
00:04:23,653 --> 00:04:25,904
What kind of theater was that?

31
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:30,195
It even had smoke effects.

32
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:32,069
Lyosha, are you OK?

33
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:37,195
Why didn't you jump?
We were worried at the end!

34
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:41,486
Here! Hide it.

35
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,612
And what should we tell them, Lyosha?

36
00:04:47,778 --> 00:04:49,778
Well, uh, uh...

37
00:04:49,944 --> 00:04:52,904
We'll say we were saving
expensive Soviet equipment.
Come on!

38
00:04:53,653 --> 00:04:56,195
What was going on?
- Luckily you survived...

39
00:04:56,361 --> 00:04:59,153
The equipment is old.
The engine failed.

40
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,570
We will investigate
and find who is responsible.

41
00:05:01,737 --> 00:05:03,028
Who is the pilot?

42
00:05:03,944 --> 00:05:07,069
Lieutenant Leonov.
We'll have a talk with him.

43
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,570
The man is a madman.

44
00:05:09,637 --> 00:05:13,778
I've never seen anything like that!
Madness! You're a hero.

45
00:05:13,944 --> 00:05:16,153
He should come to me.

46
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,111
We are in need of such crazy people.

47
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:28,528
SPACEWALKER

48
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:49,320
1963: INSTITUTE FOR EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH NO. 1

49
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:19,903
1965!

50
00:08:33,612 --> 00:08:35,320
1965.

51
00:08:38,153 --> 00:08:39,986
They can all go.

52
00:08:42,236 --> 00:08:44,528
I said you can go.

53
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,986

54
00:08:52,153 --> 00:08:54,278
Why in 1965?

55
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:57,736
Why?

56
00:08:57,903 --> 00:09:01,153
It is supposed to be in 1967.

57
00:09:01,944 --> 00:09:05,653
By that year Voskhod 2
could be prepared 100%.

58
00:09:05,986 --> 00:09:09,528
Why 1965? Because the Americans
have moved their flight.

59
00:09:10,403 --> 00:09:14,069
They want to be first in space before us.

60
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:16,153
It's unacceptable.

61
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,236
But to allow an unprepared
product into space...

62
00:09:19,403 --> 00:09:23,819
with USSR printed on its broadside...
is acceptable?

63
00:09:23,986 --> 00:09:26,153
To fall flat on our face in front
of the whole world... is acceptable?

64
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:28,528
And to get two heroic corpses,

65
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:32,777
instead of two living astronauts
welcomed on their return?

66
00:09:32,944 --> 00:09:36,528
We'll make sure that the space capsule
is reliable. But time is short.

67
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:38,861
Two space capsules.

68
00:09:39,652 --> 00:09:41,278
The first serves as a test.

69
00:09:42,445 --> 00:09:45,944
We have to deal with all eventualities
to be prepared.

70
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:49,403
The rest depends on the pilots,
and luckily...

71
00:09:49,652 --> 00:09:51,153
we have two of the best.

72
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,819

73
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:23,195
How many combat missions
did you have in the war?

74
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:26,903
Stop bugging me, Lyosh.

75
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,445
We're approaching the takeoff point.

76
00:10:32,652 --> 00:10:36,028
The cloud cover is very low.
And the wind is increasing.

77
00:10:36,611 --> 00:10:40,611
- How low?
- Ceiling is 1300 feet, without light gaps.
The wind is 12 points, gusty.

78
00:10:40,777 --> 00:10:42,278
Should we go back?

79
00:10:43,153 --> 00:10:44,694
Yes, turn back.

80
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:47,445
Let's jump. It's just wind.

81
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:49,028
With just a little wind...

82
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:52,236
chances are 1 in 10,
that we come down safe. Here!

83
00:10:56,736 --> 00:10:58,528
You can't turn back in space.

84
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:02,403
There will be different
instructions in space, Lyosh.

85
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:05,236
What did they choose us for?

86
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:07,361
Why us, why not someone else?

87
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:10,944
I haven't thought about that yet.

88
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:14,569
To handle impossible tasks.

89
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:18,153
Eat your apple. It tastes good.

90
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:26,986
I'll eat it at home.

91
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:31,736
Lyosh, you didn't get it?
We aren't jumping now.

92
00:11:31,903 --> 00:11:33,736
Who says so?
- Instructions.

93
00:11:36,903 --> 00:11:39,236
Don't get bored!

94
00:11:41,403 --> 00:11:43,944
Vlad, shut the door behind me!

95
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:30,111
Stay calm, Pasha! Pull out!

96
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:31,195
Pull out!

97
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:39,611
Unwind!

98
00:12:39,777 --> 00:12:41,652
Unwind!

99
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:44,777
Feet together!

100
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:49,278
What?
- Feet together!

101
00:13:12,236 --> 00:13:13,694
Come along.

102
00:13:20,777 --> 00:13:22,986
Keep walking! Lyosha!

103
00:13:33,195 --> 00:13:34,028
Don't touch it!

104
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:37,527
If the bird scents you,
he will not come back.

105
00:13:37,694 --> 00:13:39,611
Is that his home?
-Yes.

106
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,361
And does he sleep here, too?
- Why should I know that?

107
00:13:42,777 --> 00:13:45,944
But I want to know
where the bird sleeps, dad.

108
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,527
If you really want to know, you'll find out.
Come on, let's move on.

109
00:13:52,195 --> 00:13:54,444
Come on, Loyosha! Hurry up!

110
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,444

111
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:09,694
The content is correct, only the form is not.
- Attention!

112
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:11,819
It is not official enough.

113
00:14:11,986 --> 00:14:13,611
Comrade General, permission to speak?
-No.

114
00:14:13,777 --> 00:14:15,278
I'm sorry, may I ask...

115
00:14:15,444 --> 00:14:18,402
I would like to visit Lieutenant Colonel Belyaev.

116
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:21,736
That's what the doctors should decide.
- They have but he does not want to see anyone.

117
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,485
He is depressed.
I want to awaken his fighting spirit.

118
00:14:24,652 --> 00:14:26,527
What's with your leg?

119
00:14:26,694 --> 00:14:29,153
Oh nothing.
Just fell asleep while waiting.

120
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,986
Leonov...

121
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:33,903
Do you know why I didn't give you
a kick in the pants yet?

122
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:35,569
No.

123
00:14:35,736 --> 00:14:38,736
Neither do I.
Continue with your training.

124
00:14:38,903 --> 00:14:41,485
Thank you, Comrade General.
We'll do our best.

125
00:14:41,652 --> 00:14:45,652
Once Pavel is released ...
- Your new partner is Major Khrunov.

126
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:47,819
And what about Pavel?

127
00:14:47,986 --> 00:14:51,153
He could not help it. He did not want to jump.
I provoked him.

128
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:54,485
I know. I have read your report.

129
00:14:55,694 --> 00:15:00,319
Do not get upset.
Belyaev should first get back on his feet.

130
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:04,278
He is no longer so young.
He will soon be 40. Let him regain his health.

131
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:07,652
We have to keep the schedule.

132
00:15:08,611 --> 00:15:10,777
You are training with Khrunov for now.

133
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:12,527
Yes, sir.

134
00:15:32,153 --> 00:15:33,694
The food is getting cold.

135
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,819
Not bad.

136
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:42,195
Sveta, I've already told you, that is
the worst compliment for an artist.

137
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,903
It's not a compliment for an artist,
but it is for a cosmonaut with a paintbrush.

138
00:15:46,861 --> 00:15:49,402
Who, by the way, could have become
a very good artist.

139
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:52,402
Please, you're blocking my light...
But what about space?

140
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:56,944
A good painter does not need a rocket,

141
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:59,527
to travel to the stars.

142
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,028
But I see the stars
through the ceiling.

143
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:05,195
No, it's rather...

144
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,153
I do not see the ceiling at all,

145
00:16:08,236 --> 00:16:10,111
only the sky.

146
00:16:10,277 --> 00:16:13,652
I would if I could
go by bike to the moon.

147
00:16:14,777 --> 00:16:17,444
But such bicycles do not exist.
- Let's eat.

148
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:20,694
May I eat the apple?
- After dinner.

149
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:24,195
So let's go have dinner now.
-I beg your pardon?

150
00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:54,986
Hello!

151
00:17:00,402 --> 00:17:01,444
Alright.

152
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:04,527
Right, keep silent.

153
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,485
Then I will talk.

154
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,319
So...

155
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,235
Let's start with the program...

156
00:17:12,402 --> 00:17:14,319
for physical exercise.

157
00:17:15,194 --> 00:17:16,777
I only have one life.

158
00:17:18,235 --> 00:17:22,694
And I only have one partner.
I do not fly with anyone else.

159
00:17:24,235 --> 00:17:27,694
I am training with Khrunov, but only
so as not to get out of practice.

160
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:31,153
And once you're in shape,
we'll go to our supervisor...

161
00:17:31,402 --> 00:17:34,986
and request a medical examination.
It will be allright.

162
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:38,861
The most important thing is, that
it's not broken. Right? That's good.

163
00:17:39,194 --> 00:17:41,194
Your old injury has returned.

164
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,235
But that's not bad. It'll heal up.

165
00:17:44,402 --> 00:17:47,235
Some people get their head split open.
But that's just the leg.
- Alexey.

166
00:17:47,402 --> 00:17:48,652
Look at me.

167
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,152
And listen to me.

168
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:55,069
I will not go anywhere with you.
- You do not like me anymore?

169
00:17:56,819 --> 00:17:58,360
That's not it.

170
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:01,111
But you know no fear.
And that is not good.

171
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:09,069
I'll tell you something from my childhood.

172
00:18:09,277 --> 00:18:12,402
Go away.
- Then you will understand immediately.

173
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:15,028
Did not you hear?
- Leonov doesn't leave just like that.

174
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,986
I'll finish this and then I'll go.

175
00:18:24,777 --> 00:18:27,277
Very carefully... ok move now.

176
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:31,986
One...

177
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,903
two.

178
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:35,777
One...

179
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,110
It works...

180
00:18:41,194 --> 00:18:43,194
Wait, I'll help you! Does it hurt a lot?

181
00:18:43,652 --> 00:18:45,069
Get out! Go to hell!

182
00:18:45,235 --> 00:18:46,903
What's happened?

183
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:48,819
Get out!

184
00:18:50,444 --> 00:18:52,944
It's all right. Nothing happened.

185
00:18:54,652 --> 00:18:55,736
Get lost!

186
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,527
All right.

187
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:06,694
Good day!

188
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,360
Should I scratch for you?

189
00:19:10,402 --> 00:19:11,861
Scratch yourself.

190
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,777
In an hour.

191
00:20:00,444 --> 00:20:03,360
During the exercises
in weightlessness...

192
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:07,552
you never made any successful attempts
of entry into the airlock?

193
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,777
Why not, Comrade Major?

194
00:20:09,944 --> 00:20:13,777
There are several reasons.
One is the space suit.

195
00:20:15,235 --> 00:20:20,027
It is called the "Golden Eagle",
but it is a coffin of asbestos.

196
00:20:20,194 --> 00:20:22,903
I have a few suggestions. May I?

197
00:20:24,235 --> 00:20:25,277
Boris Victorovich!

198
00:20:26,444 --> 00:20:28,819
To pull the tether,

199
00:20:28,985 --> 00:20:30,819
you need better control
over the body,

200
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,152
which would require more agility.

201
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:37,277
You would need hinges on the shoulder,

202
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,611
elbows, knees and wrists for
greater freedom of movement.

203
00:20:40,777 --> 00:20:42,569
Did you draw that yourself?
- Yes, sir.

204
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:45,485
This takes into account
the pressure in the spacesuit.

205
00:20:45,652 --> 00:20:47,152
Listen...

206
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:51,360
To build such a spacesuit,
takes at least two years.

207
00:20:51,736 --> 00:20:55,360
If not 2.5.
- And we do not have time, Comrade Leonov.
- I see.

208
00:20:55,611 --> 00:20:58,152
But what if we shift the tether
attachment points for the supply line...

209
00:20:58,861 --> 00:21:00,652
to the helmet?

210
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:03,694
What do you mean?
What is that supposed to help?

211
00:21:04,943 --> 00:21:08,943
Our cosmonaut enters with his feet
first in the lock, right? Right.

212
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,777
I feel, it would be better, if the
cosmonaut could see where he is going...

213
00:21:11,943 --> 00:21:13,569
and go in with his head first.

214
00:21:20,194 --> 00:21:22,277
Comrades, please leave us alone for a moment.

215
00:21:25,152 --> 00:21:26,903
Go ahead.
- Me?
- Yes.

216
00:21:28,277 --> 00:21:29,652
How exactly do you want me to do this?

217
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:32,360
Head first. Show it to me.

218
00:21:34,943 --> 00:21:36,319
Go ahead.

219
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:44,611
And now turn back to face the hatch.

220
00:21:45,444 --> 00:21:49,485
Why?
- To close the outer hatch. Manually.

221
00:21:50,277 --> 00:21:53,902
But it closes automatically.
- In nine out of ten cases.

222
00:21:54,444 --> 00:21:56,152
What if you are unlucky this time?

223
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:03,527
What if your spacesuit gets stiff...

224
00:22:03,861 --> 00:22:06,277
and the oxygen is running out?

225
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:10,943
Can you imagine it?
- Yes.
- Then you are dead.

226
00:22:12,068 --> 00:22:13,652
And your partner too.

227
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:18,652
Now we know, Sergey Pavlovich.
We'll try to deal with what we have.
Sorry for bothering you.

228
00:22:19,277 --> 00:22:20,736
Sergey Pavlovich,

229
00:22:22,277 --> 00:22:23,861
we are ready to fly even in shackles,

230
00:22:24,235 --> 00:22:28,027
or in a knight's armor.
- Our people have always been in shackles.

231
00:22:29,444 --> 00:22:32,444
But imagine, if they were removed.

232
00:22:32,611 --> 00:22:33,694
What would happen then?

233
00:22:37,402 --> 00:22:39,235
We'd lose balance and crash

234
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,152
and everything would go to hell.

235
00:22:43,611 --> 00:22:45,569
That's how it is with us.

236
00:22:46,943 --> 00:22:50,110
You can go.
-Yes, sir.

237
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,068
The drawing...

238
00:22:52,485 --> 00:22:53,860
Leave her here.

239
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:17,902
Yevgeny Anatolyevich,
Belyaev is not feeling well!

240
00:23:18,068 --> 00:23:19,652
What do you mean?

241
00:23:19,818 --> 00:23:21,068
Damn it!

242
00:23:33,485 --> 00:23:36,777
Comrade Belyaev, what are you doing there?

243
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:43,569
You said I should start
to excercise my leg.

244
00:23:44,027 --> 00:23:46,319
Yes, but not like that.

245
00:23:46,485 --> 00:23:48,736
I meant, slowly. This will need time.

246
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:55,444
But I have no time Yevgeny Anatolyevich.

247
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,652
That old pilot amazes me!

248
00:24:06,818 --> 00:24:10,736
Do you know what I like most about you?
- What?

249
00:24:10,902 --> 00:24:13,943
Your smile. Smile again.

250
00:24:15,068 --> 00:24:16,652
Gagarin in person.

251
00:24:29,444 --> 00:24:30,902
Pasha!

252
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,611
Nice that you're back.

253
00:24:48,943 --> 00:24:50,985
Squad, line up!

254
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:53,068
On the ground!

255
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:54,569
Excuse me.

256
00:24:54,902 --> 00:24:57,110
Comrade Belyaev, line up!
- Yes, sir.

257
00:24:57,735 --> 00:24:59,319
Welcome back!
- Thank you.

258
00:24:59,485 --> 00:25:01,569
One, two...

259
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:28,776
INSTITUTE FOR EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH, NO. 1

260
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:30,360
120 DAYS TO LAUNCH

261
00:25:30,527 --> 00:25:31,527
Nikishin!

262
00:25:32,818 --> 00:25:34,068
Nikishin!

263
00:25:34,611 --> 00:25:37,235
Go home and get some sleep.

264
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:40,152
Finish tomorrow.
Sergei Pavlovich,

265
00:25:40,652 --> 00:25:44,444
people need rest. For three weeks now...

266
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:47,985
they've been working in three shifts.
- Soon.

267
00:25:48,152 --> 00:25:50,735
After the examination board
everyone will get a day off.

268
00:25:50,902 --> 00:25:55,402
One day.
- Let's put the head of the
commission into the spaceship.

269
00:25:55,569 --> 00:25:58,943
He'll feel like Gagarin, and be content.

270
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:02,235
Then we'll go to the celebration dinner
and after throw them all out again.

271
00:26:02,402 --> 00:26:04,860
Throwing them out is ok.

272
00:26:05,027 --> 00:26:07,235
But no outsiders in the spaceship,

273
00:26:07,402 --> 00:26:09,527
not even Brezhnev himself.

274
00:26:17,651 --> 00:26:19,194
What happened?

275
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,776
Nikishin?
- Step aside.

276
00:26:21,693 --> 00:26:23,527
Shine it on the chest and head area.

277
00:26:25,735 --> 00:26:26,776
Well?

278
00:26:30,235 --> 00:26:31,277
He's dead.

279
00:26:31,776 --> 00:26:32,818
Oh God!

280
00:26:33,985 --> 00:26:36,776
I want to know exactly what happened.

281
00:26:37,485 --> 00:26:39,902
Exactly. Boris Evseevich,

282
00:26:40,068 --> 00:26:43,569
report back to me in half an hour
what went wrong...

283
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:46,444
with the electronics.
- Yes.

284
00:26:47,235 --> 00:26:51,902
I take it that the visitation is cancelled?
- No way! I want them to see all of this.

285
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,610
It is important that they see it for themselves...

286
00:26:54,818 --> 00:26:57,360
and report it to whom they should.

287
00:27:05,735 --> 00:27:08,444
You could have done better,
Comrade Lieutenant Colonel.

288
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:13,693
One second. Would you please
give this to Svetlana Egorovna?

289
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,360
With pleasure.
- Because today is such a beautiful day.

290
00:27:16,527 --> 00:27:18,485
Good.
- And for her wise decision making.

291
00:27:22,693 --> 00:27:24,985
What's this?
- Someone asked me to give it to you.

292
00:27:28,027 --> 00:27:29,985
Put it here.

293
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:37,818
Comrade Lieutenant Colonel,
I have no objections for now.

294
00:27:38,485 --> 00:27:42,194
Let's change the workload, and
then we'll check the blood pressure.

295
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:45,319
Here's for our ladies!

296
00:27:45,651 --> 00:27:47,485
Hooray!

297
00:27:49,152 --> 00:27:50,360
Say...

298
00:27:51,152 --> 00:27:54,402
By the way, what do I call a lady
who is a cosmonaut?

299
00:27:54,568 --> 00:27:56,943
Female cosmonaut or lady cosmonaut?

300
00:27:59,194 --> 00:28:02,402
You've said already, "for our ladies."

301
00:28:03,027 --> 00:28:04,610
How did it go with the medical commission?

302
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:15,693
What did they say?

303
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,735
Not suitable.
That's the decision.

304
00:28:19,651 --> 00:28:21,110
Stop, wait a second...

305
00:28:21,943 --> 00:28:23,610
That was the decision?

306
00:28:23,776 --> 00:28:25,818
And how did they justify it?

307
00:28:25,985 --> 00:28:29,985
Anything specific?
- "Not suitable. Too old and injured," they said.

308
00:28:31,235 --> 00:28:33,610
"You can not run well with such a leg."

309
00:28:34,152 --> 00:28:35,651
I see.

310
00:28:35,818 --> 00:28:37,110
And you just accepted that?

311
00:28:38,402 --> 00:28:40,027
So who am I going to fly with now?

312
00:28:40,402 --> 00:28:42,484
You are my partner.
Why are you deserting me?

313
00:28:42,818 --> 00:28:46,444
Lyosh, what are you doing?
Am I your partner?

314
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:49,444
There is your partner.

315
00:29:01,526 --> 00:29:03,818
We don't serve our own whims,
but the common goal.

316
00:29:04,277 --> 00:29:07,360
The doctors are right,
I'm ill-suited for the task.
- I do not care about the doctors.

317
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:09,277
If I fly, it's only with you.

318
00:29:09,444 --> 00:29:12,484
Are you really going to run in space?
- The general is leaving! Fall in!

319
00:29:15,402 --> 00:29:16,902
Attention!

320
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,110
Run or not. You can't outrun fate.

321
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,610
Things didn't work out for me.

322
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:26,860
One can't outrun fate?

323
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,943
Lyosha!

324
00:29:35,152 --> 00:29:36,484
Lyosha!

325
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:38,610
It seems we must conquer
space without them now.

326
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:43,776
Are you out of your mind, Comrade Major?
Do you want to be thrown out of the squad?

327
00:29:43,943 --> 00:29:45,194
Comrade General!

328
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,402
May I speak briefly sir?

329
00:29:48,194 --> 00:29:52,860
What did you want, Comrade Leonov?
- Did you see him running? Did you?

330
00:29:53,277 --> 00:29:54,568
So he's able. Not half able.

331
00:29:54,735 --> 00:29:56,818
That's all?
- Yes... I mean, yes, sir!

332
00:29:58,526 --> 00:29:59,943
You can go.
- Yes, sir.

333
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,319
You can go!

334
00:30:10,902 --> 00:30:14,443
I'd like to see the results
of the medical commission.

335
00:30:23,985 --> 00:30:25,027
0 GRAVITY

336
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:01,735
Almaz-2 in the airlock!

337
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,194
Well done, Almaz-2!

338
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,985
START OF THE UNMANNED TEST MODULE

339
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,359
So, comrades cosmonauts...

340
00:31:17,526 --> 00:31:19,693
during the tests we'll make a film...

341
00:31:19,985 --> 00:31:21,735
about the everyday life of our Soviet heroes.

342
00:31:21,902 --> 00:31:25,110
I feel like a pop singer.
- Better than a singer.

343
00:31:25,277 --> 00:31:26,526
Scene 1, Take 3.

344
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:31,776
Today we are gathered here
not to celebrate victory,

345
00:31:31,943 --> 00:31:33,401
but to make sure...

346
00:31:33,818 --> 00:31:37,277
that this victory is possible.

347
00:31:37,443 --> 00:31:40,985
Attention, get ready and... action!
- Go to papa.
- Papa!

348
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:44,194
Papa! Ouch!
- Easy. Easy.
- Stop.

349
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:46,902
Let's go again.

350
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:50,194
Key to ignition.

351
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,693
I had a bad dream.

352
00:31:53,943 --> 00:31:55,152
That does not mean anything.
- Stop.

353
00:31:55,318 --> 00:31:56,985
The launch of the unmanned module...

354
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:02,651
will be performed at 10:30 today Moscow time.

355
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,152

356
00:32:04,484 --> 00:32:08,194
In this attempt,  the ship will reach
orbit for testing purposes.

357
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,152

358
00:32:09,401 --> 00:32:11,610
Come on, Svet.
- All right.
- There are people here...

359
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:15,276
Do not worry.
- "Farewell to the Cosmonauts",
Part 2, Scene 3, 1st Take.

360
00:32:15,943 --> 00:32:19,235
Our task is to run a full test of the equipment.

361
00:32:19,401 --> 00:32:20,152
Ignition.

362
00:32:20,318 --> 00:32:21,818
All systems from Voskhod 2...

363
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:24,276
and the inflatable airlock...

364
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,359
will be considered successfully tested,

365
00:32:28,235 --> 00:32:30,818
once the unmanned module...

366
00:32:30,985 --> 00:32:34,027
has returned to earth undamaged.
- Launch.

367
00:32:35,401 --> 00:32:36,443
Papa!

368
00:32:38,526 --> 00:32:41,818
We must be sure about the accuracy...

369
00:32:41,985 --> 00:32:44,276
of our calculations...

370
00:32:44,443 --> 00:32:46,110
before cosmonauts Pavel Belyaev...

371
00:32:46,276 --> 00:32:48,693
and Alexey Leonov fly into space.

372
00:32:49,194 --> 00:32:50,443
"The spacecraft has reached orbit"

373
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:54,484
Our heroes have a very special mission.

374
00:32:54,651 --> 00:32:55,693
"The airlock is open"

375
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,568
They will go outside the capsule for
the first time ever...

376
00:32:59,985 --> 00:33:03,443
and have a spacewalk in outer space.

377
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,234
"Simulated spacewalk has been implemented"

378
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:08,110
If this mission succeeds,

379
00:33:08,276 --> 00:33:09,943
we will be ready soon for...

380
00:33:10,818 --> 00:33:13,902
when we can be with space as equals,

381
00:33:14,276 --> 00:33:16,610
as friends.

382
00:33:16,776 --> 00:33:18,027
Take cover!

383
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,902
"Attention! The connection with
the test module has been lost"

384
00:33:25,526 --> 00:33:29,194
"Repeat, the connection with the test
module has been lost"

385
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:31,610
"Confirm, observing the cloud of wreckage"

386
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:53,027
Good to see you, Sergey Pavlovich.
- Good to see you.

387
00:33:53,193 --> 00:33:54,651
You are kindly requested.

388
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,985

389
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,359

390
00:34:02,276 --> 00:34:03,776

391
00:34:03,943 --> 00:34:05,110
Good to see you, Leonid Ilyich.

392
00:34:05,484 --> 00:34:07,401
Wait a moment, Sergey Pavlovich.

393
00:34:07,568 --> 00:34:09,651
Let's finish the movie and then talk.

394
00:34:11,193 --> 00:34:13,735
I do not have time to watch movies.

395
00:34:14,735 --> 00:34:16,193
We are in a race against time.

396
00:34:16,693 --> 00:34:18,818
We are getting the floor
pulled from under our feet.

397
00:34:18,985 --> 00:34:23,193
That does not happen to
those who keep step...

398
00:34:23,735 --> 00:34:27,234
and you're Sergey Pavlovich,
an engine for progress.

399
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:35,193
I have a comprehensive report here
with all the technical details.

400
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,610
I'll summarize it briefly.

401
00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:42,151
If something is unclear, please ask.
- I already know.

402
00:34:42,484 --> 00:34:44,359
The spacecraft reached orbit.

403
00:34:45,568 --> 00:34:49,110
The spacewalk was simulated.

404
00:34:49,276 --> 00:34:52,943
And now do the same thing again,

405
00:34:53,902 --> 00:34:57,651
but this time with two cosmonauts,
and collect a Gold Star.

406
00:34:57,818 --> 00:35:00,818
But the ship fell apart,
and we do not know why.

407
00:35:00,985 --> 00:35:03,318
We are still searching for the cause.
- Was there a spacewalk?

408
00:35:05,151 --> 00:35:08,526
Conditionally, yes.
- Now do it unconditionally.

409
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:13,401
The United States wants to launch
their spacecraft in May.

410
00:35:13,568 --> 00:35:16,027
That's why Voskhod has to fly earlier.

411
00:35:16,193 --> 00:35:19,818
So that the whole world knows
that we are the first.

412
00:35:21,068 --> 00:35:24,735
Our time in space is happening now.

413
00:35:24,902 --> 00:35:28,401
It is the time of pioneers!
- I do not care about the Americans.

414
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,776
I understand that the main thing for us,
for our country...

415
00:35:32,401 --> 00:35:34,610
is not to fall flat on our face.

416
00:35:34,776 --> 00:35:37,860
But as long as I carry the responsibility,

417
00:35:38,776 --> 00:35:42,109
an unprepared spacecraft won't go to space.

418
00:35:42,276 --> 00:35:44,568
All the more, if my people are inside.

419
00:35:44,735 --> 00:35:47,109
Only over my dead body!
- Is that a fact?

420
00:35:47,276 --> 00:35:48,860
I'm serious.

421
00:35:50,443 --> 00:35:51,818
You know what?

422
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:54,276
Sleep on it first.

423
00:35:55,151 --> 00:35:57,818
And tomorrow get back to work.

424
00:35:57,985 --> 00:36:00,234
We do not have anyone else but you.

425
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:03,109
You are irreplaceable for us.

426
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:30,276
COSMONAUT QUARTERS BAIKONUR

427
00:36:30,443 --> 00:36:32,359
ONE DAY TO LAUNCH

428
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,401
I wonder if it's snowing in Moscow too.
If so, I can go ski with the girls.

429
00:36:49,776 --> 00:36:52,318
Yeah, right... build a snowman, eat pierogies.

430
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:54,026
Was everything in vain?

431
00:36:55,151 --> 00:36:57,443
Don't drink and start rambling.

432
00:36:59,276 --> 00:37:01,026
So we don't fly?

433
00:37:01,902 --> 00:37:05,234
I don't think about it.
There are rules.

434
00:37:05,401 --> 00:37:09,401
We've spent so much time and effort.
All sizzle, no steak.
What are they thinking?

435
00:37:09,568 --> 00:37:11,318
What do you want to do?

436
00:37:11,484 --> 00:37:14,276
You want Korolyov to trust luck
and appoint the launch?

437
00:37:14,443 --> 00:37:19,359
Not luck, Pasha, we took apart that ship
cog by cog, and put it back together.

438
00:37:19,526 --> 00:37:21,568
I have confidence in it like in my own mother.

439
00:37:22,651 --> 00:37:24,484
But you're just standing around and packing!

440
00:37:25,026 --> 00:37:28,151
Do you think you're the only one
who wants to fly to space?

441
00:37:34,776 --> 00:37:37,651
OK, well...
we have to obey the orders.

442
00:37:38,318 --> 00:37:40,443
I don't care about the orders.

443
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:44,193
I won't back down.

444
00:37:47,234 --> 00:37:48,526
Yes?

445
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:52,234
Good morning, Sergey Pavlovich.
- Good morning, Comrade Chief Designer.

446
00:37:52,776 --> 00:37:53,984
Good Morning.

447
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:00,735
You've been up for a while?
- No. Just got up. Drinking tea.

448
00:38:02,984 --> 00:38:07,276
As you know, the test flight failed.

449
00:38:08,568 --> 00:38:13,193
Launching Voskhod 2 with
people is too risky.

450
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,942
We'll repeatedly launch an empty module...

451
00:38:16,276 --> 00:38:18,568
on the rocket until it's perfected.

452
00:38:18,735 --> 00:38:22,109
We'll build a new one in a year,
and then you'll fly.

453
00:38:22,942 --> 00:38:25,193
Alright.
- What is your problem?

454
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,610
That the Americans will be the first?

455
00:38:27,776 --> 00:38:30,443
Sergey Pavlovich, we are in
peak physical condition.

456
00:38:31,401 --> 00:38:32,776
We worked over 3000 emergency situations.

457
00:38:32,942 --> 00:38:36,401
There will be a 3001st, 3002nd,
and 3003rd in space.

458
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:41,109
Sending you up now,
would mean your certain death.

459
00:38:41,568 --> 00:38:44,568
And the country would cry for only a moment.
- Why are you here then?

460
00:38:47,151 --> 00:38:48,359
You are a farmer.

461
00:38:49,067 --> 00:38:50,526
From the village Listvyanka.

462
00:38:51,234 --> 00:38:52,942
In the district Kemerovo.

463
00:38:59,735 --> 00:39:02,610
When I was three, my father became
condemned as an enemy of the people.

464
00:39:03,484 --> 00:39:06,234
And we were marked as a family of saboteurs.

465
00:39:06,401 --> 00:39:08,193
Immediately the neighbors came...

466
00:39:08,776 --> 00:39:12,443
and took our food, the furniture
and then the house.

467
00:39:14,526 --> 00:39:16,942
We stood on the street, in the freezing cold.

468
00:39:18,151 --> 00:39:21,109
My mother was pregnant with eight children.

469
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:25,859
One of the neighbors took my pants off,

470
00:39:26,026 --> 00:39:27,942
and I just stood there in my shirt.

471
00:39:29,109 --> 00:39:31,401
Thank God, my older sister and
her husband sheltered us.

472
00:39:31,942 --> 00:39:33,651
In a room in a dormitory for workers.

473
00:39:33,818 --> 00:39:35,984
16 square meters for all of us together.

474
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:38,359
I had to sleep under the bed.

475
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:41,942
But so what, we survived.

476
00:39:42,109 --> 00:39:45,234
Then came the war and all
men had to go to the front.

477
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:50,901
The others went to field hospitals
or to build factories or to study.

478
00:39:51,067 --> 00:39:55,401
I wanted to learn so my mom sent
me to school. I was so proud.

479
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,193
Then I looked at my feet.

480
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,526
I stood in a puddle of ice and had no shoes.

481
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:03,901
But so what, we withstood, we survived!

482
00:40:04,651 --> 00:40:08,859
Then came the victory. But at what price?
All uncles, brothers had died.

483
00:40:09,901 --> 00:40:12,276
That's how it was all over the
country in every family.

484
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:16,067
Sergey Pavlovich,
we have experienced so much.

485
00:40:16,984 --> 00:40:19,026
Gone through so much.

486
00:40:20,193 --> 00:40:23,276
Not to get scared of an emergency situation.

487
00:40:23,568 --> 00:40:26,359
If the hatch gets stuck,
I'll gnaw a hole in it and crawl out.

488
00:40:33,526 --> 00:40:34,901
Sergey Pavlovich.

489
00:40:36,276 --> 00:40:38,401
We are ready to take the risk.

490
00:41:08,443 --> 00:41:10,817
The tea is pretty strong.

491
00:43:05,401 --> 00:43:07,109
See you!

492
00:43:13,692 --> 00:43:15,193

493

Comrade General, we are ready to launch!

494
00:43:33,942 --> 00:43:36,568
Report back to comrade Brezhnev
and comrade Kosygin,

495
00:43:37,151 --> 00:43:39,650
that the spaceship Voskhod 2

496
00:43:40,067 --> 00:43:42,109

- Yes, sir!

497
00:43:43,609 --> 00:43:45,692
Zarya, this is Almaz, we are ready.

498
00:43:48,901 --> 00:43:50,401
Attention! We are one minute to launch.

499

Elongating the airlock now.

540
00:46:53,483 --> 00:46:55,775

541
00:46:55,984 --> 00:46:59,775
Zarya, the airlock has been elongated.
We're starting to equalize the pressure in the airlock.

"Zarya, we are preparing to enter the airlock"

Switching to the oxygen supply

Zarya, the spacesuit is pressure-tight,
opening the inner hatch of the airlock.

546
00:47:56,775 --> 00:47:58,400
Don't get bored.

547
00:47:59,567 --> 00:48:01,234
I'll be right back.

548
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:08,901
Pasha, give me a little push.

549
00:48:09,942 --> 00:48:10,984
Ooh.

550
00:48:16,525 --> 00:48:18,234
This is Almaz-2.

551
00:48:18,984 --> 00:48:20,650
I am in the airlock.

"The air pressure is elevated,
but still within the normal range"

Almaz-2, your oxygen
consumption is above normal.

560
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,942
Lyosha, breathe more calmly.

561
00:49:11,483 --> 00:49:12,901
I'm almost not breathing.

562
00:49:15,067 --> 00:49:17,483
Attention, be ready!

563
00:49:18,775 --> 00:49:21,442
Zarya, the airlock pressure is zero.

564
00:49:22,901 --> 00:49:25,901
Opening the outer hatch of the airlock.

565
00:49:32,026 --> 00:49:34,400
"Almaz-2, give a status report"

566

00:49:38,233 --> 00:49:40,067
Everything's ok.

568
00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:43,775
"Ready to go outside the ship"

569

Begin with the exit into space.

00:49:52,901 --> 00:49:54,734
Copy!

571
00:49:54,901 --> 00:49:56,734

Zarya!

579
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:07,901
This is Almaz-2.

580
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:13,275
I'm on the edge of the airlock.

581
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:17,067
I feel excellent.

582
00:51:17,859 --> 00:51:21,150
Below me, I see clouds and the sea.

583
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:25,901
I'm just scanning the mountain
range of the Caucasus.

584
00:51:28,609 --> 00:51:31,942
I see the sky and the earth.

585
00:51:32,817 --> 00:51:34,775
And directly below me the Volga!

586
00:51:37,233 --> 00:51:40,650
Ideal working conditions!

587
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:45,400
Almaz-2, get ready to leave.

588
00:51:45,567 --> 00:51:47,233
Yes, copy that.

589
00:52:14,609 --> 00:52:16,859
Remove the lens cap from the camera.

590
00:52:25,817 --> 00:52:28,483
Finished! I have removed the lid!

591
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:30,192
What do I do with it now?

592
00:52:30,984 --> 00:52:32,233
"Where do I put it"

593
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,192
Just throw it away.

594
00:52:36,358 --> 00:52:37,150
"Copy"

595
00:52:37,692 --> 00:52:38,650
Throwing away.

596
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,358
Zarya, this is Almaz-2.

597
00:52:45,525 --> 00:52:47,233
Pulling out the tether.

598

<i>Soviet Cosmovision is sharing...</i>

Start the exit.

"Almaz-2, you can depart"

606
00:53:53,901 --> 00:53:55,483
Ok, ok, wait a sec.

607
00:54:11,483 --> 00:54:13,108
Let's go.

608
00:54:26,483 --> 00:54:28,775
"Zvezda, Zarya!"

609
00:54:28,941 --> 00:54:31,901
"This is Almaz"

"Man has stepped into outer space"

<i>stepped out into outer space.</i>

625

My dad is a real cosmonaut!
A real cosmonaut!

626
00:55:38,442 --> 00:55:40,442
So, now we only need to learn docking.

627
00:55:40,609 --> 00:55:43,609
Then we can form space
stations for the Space Army.

628
00:55:43,775 --> 00:55:46,150
Excellent! Thank you all!

629

00:56:14,609 --> 00:56:15,858
Comrade General,

631
00:56:16,025 --> 00:56:17,442
the Kremlin is calling.

632
00:56:17,609 --> 00:56:19,275
They ask to connect directly
with the cosmonaut.

633
00:56:19,734 --> 00:56:22,775
Well then connect them!
- Connect them.
- Yes, sir.

634
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,275
"Lyosha!"

635

639
00:56:50,567 --> 00:56:52,775
"Brezhnev is on the line"

640
00:56:52,941 --> 00:56:54,900

641
00:56:55,066 --> 00:56:56,150
"How are you, son?"

642
00:56:56,317 --> 00:56:58,066

My mind is clear, my vision is not disturbed.

644
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,442
Spatial orientation is normal.

645
00:57:04,609 --> 00:57:09,816
So man can work in space.

646
00:57:09,983 --> 00:57:12,525
Man can...

647
00:57:12,692 --> 00:57:13,900
work in space.

648
00:57:14,066 --> 00:57:17,400
"Oh, yeah... I see how you're tumbling
around out there"

649
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:21,108
"The whole country is watching you.
The whole world"

650
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:22,233
Thank you.

651
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,358
"We are very proud of you"

652
00:57:23,525 --> 00:57:25,609
Thank you, really thank you!

653
00:57:26,233 --> 00:57:28,358
"Just come back alive"

654
00:57:28,525 --> 00:57:30,150
"That is an order. Do you hear?"

655
00:57:31,025 --> 00:57:34,275
"Proud to serve the Soviet Union"

656
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,650
What is his condition?

657
00:57:36,816 --> 00:57:40,483
Blood pressure and body temperature
have risen slightly. But otherwise...

658
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:44,442
his condition is stable.
- And the air supply?

659
00:57:44,858 --> 00:57:46,567
That's enough for 27 minutes.

660
00:57:46,734 --> 00:57:48,525
Then quickly to the next stage!

661
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,066
"Almaz-2"

662
00:57:53,233 --> 00:57:55,858
Get ready for push off to test the
reaction of the vestibular system,

663
00:57:56,066 --> 00:57:59,192
"the balance test in space"

664
00:58:00,233 --> 00:58:01,983

665
00:58:20,816 --> 00:58:22,733
Almaz-2, how are you?

666
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,150
"I feel great!"

667
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:27,774
I'm ready...

668
00:58:27,941 --> 00:58:31,150
for the last gear and the photographs.

669
00:58:31,317 --> 00:58:34,983
His blood pressure has suddenly
increased to 140 over 90.

670
00:58:35,442 --> 00:58:38,941
Pulse 125. Body temperature 98.
- He is excited.

671
00:58:39,733 --> 00:58:42,233
That would be everyone in his place.
- Almasz-2.

672
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,900
Take a few pictures and then home!

673
00:58:45,066 --> 00:58:46,733
But without sudden movements.

674
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,192
"Nice and slow"

675
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,567
That's affirmative.

676
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:00,567
Pasha, are you smiling there?

677
00:59:01,858 --> 00:59:02,900
I am.

678
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:05,983
Next photo.

679
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:09,150
"Time is running out.
Take some pictures and come back"

680
00:59:13,275 --> 00:59:16,150
What's this?

681
00:59:16,317 --> 00:59:17,858
What's with the pressure?

682
00:59:20,983 --> 00:59:22,900
What's with the pressure?

683
00:59:43,816 --> 00:59:46,317
Almasz-2, are you alright?

684
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:49,275
"Almasz, what's going on there?"

685
00:59:51,858 --> 00:59:53,275
"Almaz-2 is not replying"

686
00:59:53,774 --> 00:59:55,983
"There was a blow to the ship's hull"

687
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:58,691
"Visual contact with Almaz-2 was lost"

688
00:59:59,774 --> 01:00:01,567
What about the connection?

689
01:00:02,983 --> 01:00:06,317
The devices are working well.
It is not a technical problem.

690
01:00:06,483 --> 01:00:10,192
What is his condition?
- Blood pressure, pulse, temperature...
All are rising.

691
01:00:16,608 --> 01:00:18,900
"Almaz, continue calling Almaz-2"

692
01:00:19,192 --> 01:00:20,649
"I repeat: Almaz!"

693
01:00:20,858 --> 01:00:22,691
continue calling Almaz-2

694
01:00:22,858 --> 01:00:25,150
Everything went too well, too seamlessly.

695
01:00:25,317 --> 01:00:28,317
Stop all on-air broadcasts.
- Yes, sir.

696
01:00:30,066 --> 01:00:31,900
<i>We are presenting to the audience...</i>

697
01:00:32,066 --> 01:00:35,275
<i>the ballet "The Stone Flower"
by Sergey Prokofiev,</i>

698
01:00:35,442 --> 01:00:37,941
<i>on stage at the State Academic
Bolshoi Theatre,</i>

699
01:00:38,108 --> 01:00:41,649
<i>where the Lenin Medal was awarded.</i>

700
01:00:55,442 --> 01:00:56,608
We'll wait.

701
01:01:05,649 --> 01:01:09,066
"Almaz-2, do you read me, over?"

702
01:01:15,816 --> 01:01:18,066
Almaz-2, over?

703
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,524
"Zarya, I cannot connect with Almaz-2"

704
01:01:22,691 --> 01:01:24,275
"I'll continue trying"

705
01:01:24,442 --> 01:01:25,442
Sergey Pavlovich,

706
01:01:26,108 --> 01:01:28,608
for such cases we have concrete instructions.

707
01:01:28,816 --> 01:01:32,108
If Almaz-2 cannot get back to the ship...

708
01:01:32,275 --> 01:01:34,983
we have to get ready to blast off the airlock.

709
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,317
Blood pressure 155 over 100,

710
01:01:37,483 --> 01:01:41,608
pulse 150, body temperature 101.

711
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,816

712
01:02:25,816 --> 01:02:27,858
Zarya, this is Almaz.

713
01:02:28,025 --> 01:02:30,150
Request for permission to enter the airlock.

714
01:02:35,774 --> 01:02:37,358
How long until the dead zone?

715
01:02:37,566 --> 01:02:39,941
Another 5 minutes until the connection aborts.
- Sergey Pavlovich.

716
01:02:40,317 --> 01:02:44,524
The exit of the second cosmonaut means
the full depressurizing of the ship.

717
01:02:44,691 --> 01:02:47,566
And they'll have to find their way back by themselves
because the connection will be lost.

718
01:02:47,774 --> 01:02:52,358
And who knows how the spaceship
will behave in this case?

719
01:02:52,524 --> 01:02:55,025
Start praying then.
- Sergey Pavlovich,

720
01:02:55,233 --> 01:02:59,233
if we blast off the airlock,
only one cosmonaut will die.

721
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,941
If you give that order,

722
01:03:01,108 --> 01:03:03,858
both could die.
- Almaz,

723
01:03:04,025 --> 01:03:06,941
Prepare to depressurize the ship.

724
01:03:09,649 --> 01:03:11,233
Copy, Zarya.

725
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,482
"2 minutes. Standby"

726
01:03:43,317 --> 01:03:45,025
If Belyaev does not succeed,

727
01:03:45,192 --> 01:03:49,108
the result of the colossal work of thousands
of Soviet citizens will stay in orbit.

728
01:03:49,275 --> 01:03:51,025
At the moment I am only interested in these two.

729
01:03:51,192 --> 01:03:53,275
"Zarya, this is Almaz"

730
01:03:54,441 --> 01:03:57,025
I'm ready to go into the airlock.

731
01:03:57,192 --> 01:03:59,941
Waiting for the order.
- We do not have the right...

732
01:04:00,108 --> 01:04:02,816
to fail the whole space program for one man.

733
01:04:02,983 --> 01:04:07,150
One minute until the dead zone!
- Cancel the command, Sergey Pavlovich!

734
01:04:07,317 --> 01:04:09,233
What is the state of Almaz-2?

735
01:04:09,441 --> 01:04:11,566
"Blood pressure 170 over 110,

736
01:04:11,733 --> 01:04:15,858
pulse 165, body temperature 102"

737
01:04:16,691 --> 01:04:17,941
He's alive.

738
01:04:18,108 --> 01:04:20,317
He's alive. Got it?

739
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:21,691
"Zarya, this is Almaz"

740
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,900
I repeat: I'm ready to go into the airlock.
Waiting for the order.

741
01:04:26,524 --> 01:04:28,941
I hope you know what you are doing.

742
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:30,900
30 seconds until entering the dead zone.

743
01:04:39,025 --> 01:04:40,108
"Zarya, I repeat,"

744
01:04:40,317 --> 01:04:41,482
I'm waiting for the command.

745
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:44,317
Start depressurizing the ship.

746
01:04:44,482 --> 01:04:45,608
15 seconds.

747
01:04:48,608 --> 01:04:50,441
There he is! Almaz-2. Next to the airlock!

748
01:04:50,649 --> 01:04:51,649
"Zarya, I confirm:"

749
01:04:51,858 --> 01:04:54,192
Almaz-2 is next to the airlock.
- Almaz-2!

750
01:04:54,399 --> 01:04:56,816
Come back inside immediately!

751
01:05:01,357 --> 01:05:02,399
They are in the dead zone.

752
01:05:05,816 --> 01:05:06,900
What happened?

753
01:05:07,066 --> 01:05:11,441
"The spacesuit inflated.
Arms, legs, fingers...
I can hardly move"

754
01:05:11,608 --> 01:05:12,441
Why didn't you answer?

755
01:05:12,649 --> 01:05:14,649
Didn't want to bother you all.

756
01:05:14,816 --> 01:05:17,192
"I see. Ok"

757
01:05:18,566 --> 01:05:20,816
How much oxygen do I have?

758
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:23,233
Not much.

759
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:27,399
"Lyosha, hurry up"

760
01:05:29,192 --> 01:05:30,524
Lyosha, there's no time at all.

761
01:05:30,983 --> 01:05:32,441
"Take the camera and get into the ship!"

762
01:05:32,608 --> 01:05:34,691
Ok, Ok... Taking the camera, Pasha.

763
01:05:34,858 --> 01:05:36,192
Hurry up!

764
01:05:47,399 --> 01:05:48,233
Well done.

765
01:05:55,316 --> 01:05:56,816
"Got it. Now try"

766
01:05:58,150 --> 01:05:59,816
That's the only way.

767
01:06:06,524 --> 01:06:07,816
Come on!

768
01:06:08,649 --> 01:06:09,983
What a mess.

769
01:06:10,274 --> 01:06:11,316
Try again!

770
01:06:11,691 --> 01:06:12,900
"Brace yourself, Lyosha!"

771
01:06:13,858 --> 01:06:14,399
"Stop!"

772
01:06:14,608 --> 01:06:15,900
Stop! Don't you dare!

773
01:06:16,066 --> 01:06:17,774
"Only with the legs first!"

774
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:19,983
Close.

775
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:23,733
"Close! Close, I said!"

776
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:24,900
"Do it!"

777
01:06:37,357 --> 01:06:39,274
It hasn't closed, right?

778
01:06:39,441 --> 01:06:40,691
"No"

779
01:06:43,108 --> 01:06:47,274
"I see. Then I have to turn around
and close the hatch manually"

780
01:06:47,482 --> 01:06:48,941
That won't work, Lyosha.

781
01:06:50,232 --> 01:06:51,482
What is the alternative?

782
01:06:52,566 --> 01:06:55,399
I'll open the hatch, pull you in...

783
01:06:55,566 --> 01:06:57,025
"and depressurize the ship?"

784
01:06:57,191 --> 01:06:58,399
So, we'll have to take the risk.

785
01:06:58,566 --> 01:07:00,191
"And put the whole operation at risk?"

786
01:07:02,232 --> 01:07:04,066
No, Pasha. I'll try again.

787
01:07:04,232 --> 01:07:05,150
"Lyosha!"

788
01:07:05,316 --> 01:07:06,608
Lyosha, no!

789
01:07:07,566 --> 01:07:09,274
"Lyosha!"

790
01:07:10,566 --> 01:07:11,274
Stop!

791
01:07:11,441 --> 01:07:13,983
"You only had a little air before.
Now you won't have..."

792
01:07:14,191 --> 01:07:15,025
anything at all.

793
01:07:15,191 --> 01:07:17,482
Then you can eject me together
with the airlock.

794
01:07:17,691 --> 01:07:18,858
You're bull-headed!

795
01:07:34,524 --> 01:07:36,524
Damn, I'm stuck!

796
01:07:36,691 --> 01:07:38,941
I can't move!
- Lyosha, talk less.

797
01:07:39,149 --> 01:07:40,649
"You're consuming too much oxygen"

798
01:07:40,816 --> 01:07:42,649
OK, I'm silent.

799
01:07:47,608 --> 01:07:51,691
What if I put the leg... like this?

800
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:53,774
"Keep trying, go!"

801
01:07:57,108 --> 01:07:58,816
Come on, Lyosha!

802
01:07:59,941 --> 01:08:00,900
Go, go, go!

803
01:08:06,399 --> 01:08:09,025
"Yes! The airlock is pressure-tight!"

804
01:08:09,191 --> 01:08:12,316
"Now hold on for a few more minutes"

805
01:08:19,774 --> 01:08:21,399
"Lyosha. Lyosha, no!"

806
01:09:21,482 --> 01:09:22,900
Lyosha!

807
01:09:26,482 --> 01:09:27,983
It's over.
- What?

808
01:09:29,065 --> 01:09:30,649
My race is over.

809
01:09:31,858 --> 01:09:34,191
Good job, Lyosha.

810
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:57,149
Ok, I see, but can you tell us?

811
01:09:57,316 --> 01:09:59,691
I understand, but what does it mean?

812
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:04,549
Ok.

813
01:10:04,816 --> 01:10:06,149
Thank you.

814
01:10:08,941 --> 01:10:12,733
They say the flight is proceeding as planned.

815
01:10:13,691 --> 01:10:16,482
Lyosha always answers like that,
if he gets disturbed at work...

816
01:10:17,399 --> 01:10:19,524
or if the situation is bad.

817
01:10:29,566 --> 01:10:31,733
In Moscow and Leningrad
there were demonstrations...

818
01:10:32,357 --> 01:10:33,816
in honor of the pilots.

819
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:39,524
Svetlana Leonova called.
- Tea?
- No, thank you.

820
01:10:40,399 --> 01:10:41,941
She wanted to know what's going on.

821
01:10:42,149 --> 01:10:43,858
She is worried.
- Why is she worried?

822
01:10:44,065 --> 01:10:45,608
Everything is fine.

823
01:10:45,816 --> 01:10:47,941
Voskhod 2 is going to escape
the dead zone in a minute.

824
01:10:48,149 --> 01:10:49,691
Start calling.

825
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:17,316
Lyosha?

826
01:11:20,065 --> 01:11:21,274
Lyosha, come back to earth!

827
01:11:22,107 --> 01:11:23,566
Almaz-2!

828
01:11:23,733 --> 01:11:25,649
We are escaping the dead zone.

829
01:11:27,441 --> 01:11:29,357
Hey, I was thinking...

830
01:11:30,232 --> 01:11:31,608
next time,

831
01:11:32,357 --> 01:11:35,107
when we fly to the moon ...
- Command Center is on the line.

832
01:11:35,816 --> 01:11:37,900
Get ready for a scolding.

833
01:11:38,065 --> 01:11:40,566
"Almaz, this is Zarya"

834
01:11:40,733 --> 01:11:42,232
"do you read me?"

835
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:44,816
Zarya, this is Almaz,
reading you loud and clear.

836
01:11:45,858 --> 01:11:48,274
Almaz, what is with Almaz-2?

837
01:11:49,191 --> 01:11:50,232
Zarya, this is Almaz-2...

838
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:51,441
"reading you loud and clear also"

839
01:11:51,816 --> 01:11:53,691
What a rascal!

840
01:11:58,899 --> 01:12:00,441
Almaz-2,

841
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:04,441
"Welcome back! Thank you for your service!"

842
01:12:07,399 --> 01:12:09,482
Thank you. Proud to serve to the Soviet...

843
01:12:09,649 --> 01:12:10,691
"Why the hell..."

844
01:12:10,858 --> 01:12:12,441
didn't you answer?

845
01:12:18,482 --> 01:12:22,274
Zarya, we had some problems with the connection.
We could not find the cause.

846
01:12:22,441 --> 01:12:23,649
"Almaz-2,"

847
01:12:24,024 --> 01:12:26,316
"you can't answer for yourself?"

848
01:12:26,482 --> 01:12:27,691
I confirm.

849
01:12:27,857 --> 01:12:31,274
Zarya, everything is alright here.
We are ready to blast-off the airlock.

850
01:12:31,649 --> 01:12:33,274
"Get ready..."

851
01:12:33,899 --> 01:12:35,065
"to blast off the airlock!"

852
01:12:35,232 --> 01:12:37,065
Getting ready to blast off the airlock.

853
01:12:37,232 --> 01:12:38,691
"Again as a reminder..."

854
01:12:38,857 --> 01:12:42,816
"that we implemented the test cycle
only until this stage"

855
01:12:43,024 --> 01:12:45,691
"We don't know what can happen after
blasting off the airlock"

856
01:12:45,982 --> 01:12:48,608
Be ready for anything and evrything.

857
01:12:49,608 --> 01:12:51,232
It can't get any worse.

858
01:12:52,774 --> 01:12:56,274
"Almaz, check the pressure in the cabin"

859
01:12:56,733 --> 01:12:58,357
The pressure in the cabin is normal.

860
01:12:58,524 --> 01:13:00,733
"Check the contact of the igniters"

861
01:13:00,899 --> 01:13:03,149
Check. Ready to blast off the airlock.

862
01:13:05,524 --> 01:13:06,566
Blast off!

863
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:24,940
Zarya, blasting the airlock is complete.

864
01:13:25,107 --> 01:13:27,899
No pressure loss or other problems.

865
01:13:28,608 --> 01:13:30,107
But we turned.

866
01:13:32,482 --> 01:13:35,566
How far have you turned, Almaz?

867
01:13:35,733 --> 01:13:37,149
"I would say..."

868
01:13:37,316 --> 01:13:39,191
"around 20 degrees"

869
01:13:39,357 --> 01:13:42,608
The automatic control system
could stabilize the ship.

870
01:13:42,815 --> 01:13:46,149
But that would consume all the fuel
intended for manual landing.

871
01:13:46,316 --> 01:13:49,691
Sergey Pavlovich, I'll put my
neck on the line for the automation.

872
01:13:49,857 --> 01:13:51,441
The manual landing won't be necessary.

873
01:13:55,733 --> 01:13:58,024
Almaz's, how do you feel?

874
01:13:59,857 --> 01:14:02,024
We feel good, Zarya.

875
01:14:03,107 --> 01:14:04,608
Well then...

876
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:07,191
Let's go for a spin.

877
01:14:07,649 --> 01:14:10,566
"It's 15 orbits before
entering the landing zone"

878
01:14:10,733 --> 01:14:13,482
"That's about 22 hours"

879
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:15,024
"What do you think, can you endure that?"

880
01:14:16,149 --> 01:14:17,691
We will, Zarya.

881
01:14:17,857 --> 01:14:19,982
"Hold on, my eagles"

882
01:14:20,191 --> 01:14:21,857
"Hold on"

883
01:14:22,857 --> 01:14:24,982
22 hours...

884
01:14:26,149 --> 01:14:27,982
That's like going to Tuapse by train

885
01:14:29,815 --> 01:14:31,608
riding in the upper berth.

886
01:14:55,274 --> 01:14:56,691

887
01:14:56,857 --> 01:14:58,940

888
01:15:01,065 --> 01:15:02,982
20TH HOUR OF FLIGHT

889
01:15:03,149 --> 01:15:07,316
TWO HOURS UNTIL ACTIVATING AUTOMATIC LANDING

890
01:15:52,441 --> 01:15:56,191
You should sleep a bit.
There are ten more orbits.

891
01:15:57,608 --> 01:16:01,857
Later. I need to finish the drawing.
Tretyakov Gallery is waitng.

892
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:04,174
The Tretyakov Gallery?
- What did you think?

893
01:16:04,441 --> 01:16:07,316
The first picture that was drawn in space.

894
01:16:07,482 --> 01:16:10,773
This isn't just a drawing of flowers in pots.

895
01:16:11,648 --> 01:16:15,149
They will hang it right next to
"Morning in a Pine Forest".

896
01:16:15,316 --> 01:16:19,107
Do you know they called me to go to the art Academy?
They kept me a place until the last moment.

897
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:21,773
Why didn't you go?
- What for?

898
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:24,399
You can fly and paint.

899
01:16:24,566 --> 01:16:26,690
But paint and fly... It's unlikely.

900
01:16:26,857 --> 01:16:29,982
Well... They called me to visit Cuba.

901
01:16:30,149 --> 01:16:34,608
You?
- Yeah, they called me right from
the embassy to the ship.

902
01:16:34,773 --> 01:16:39,065
I was congratulated. "Come here," they said,
"Pavel Ivanovich, for holidays."

903
01:16:39,232 --> 01:16:42,773
Ah... But where was I?
- I don't know, you went somewhere.

904
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:44,482
Right.

905
01:16:44,648 --> 01:16:47,566
Brezhnev congratulated me at the same time.

906
01:16:48,357 --> 01:16:51,690
He said he will come to the airport to meet me.

907
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:55,857
"Lyosha," he said, "Just when you descend
the ladder, look to the left,"

908
01:16:56,024 --> 01:16:58,274
"you'll recognize me, by my hat."

909
01:16:59,149 --> 01:17:04,107
Then were going to the country.
No, to the Kremlin first.
Then to the country.

910
01:17:05,316 --> 01:17:08,024
I wish you would draw instead, Lyosha.

911
01:17:24,274 --> 01:17:25,565
Lyosha...

912
01:17:28,107 --> 01:17:30,316
Lyosha!
- What is it?

913
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:35,024
How do you feel? Everything Ok?
- Yeah, just a little bit queasy.

914
01:17:35,357 --> 01:17:37,316
But that's normal.

915
01:17:38,482 --> 01:17:40,732
How much oxygen do we have?
- One moment.

916
01:17:43,149 --> 01:17:44,191
No way.

917
01:17:48,773 --> 01:17:51,024
Almost three hundred. Call.

918
01:17:55,690 --> 01:17:56,607
Zarya, this is Almaz.

919
01:17:56,815 --> 01:17:59,940
"Our oxygen content is twice above normal"

920
01:18:00,107 --> 01:18:01,732
What's the exact value?

921
01:18:01,899 --> 01:18:04,482
296... and still climbing.

922
01:18:05,523 --> 01:18:06,940
Almaz's...

923
01:18:07,107 --> 01:18:10,149
No sudden movements. This is not air...

924
01:18:10,316 --> 01:18:11,815
"but pure oxygen"

925
01:18:11,982 --> 01:18:14,523
"The littlest spark and you'll burn instantly"

926
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:15,732
Copy.

927
01:18:17,107 --> 01:18:18,107
What should we do?

928
01:18:18,399 --> 01:18:22,565
Turn off the main lights.
Stand by for instructions.

929
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:24,982
Copy.

930
01:18:29,857 --> 01:18:31,482
Where is the oxygen coming from?

931
01:18:33,899 --> 01:18:35,399
They'll find out.

932
01:18:36,024 --> 01:18:38,191
There is a leak somewhere.
- Maybe from the backpacks.

933
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:41,107
Leonov left his in the airlock,
so..., it's Belyaev's?

934
01:18:41,316 --> 01:18:44,523
And the value reached 296 at once?
Because of just one backpack?

935
01:18:44,732 --> 01:18:46,940
Then it's from one of the oxygen compensators.

936
01:18:47,149 --> 01:18:51,316
But there aren't any failures in the system
and the capsule is tight and undamaged.

937
01:18:51,481 --> 01:18:55,441
Maybe the hatch shifted away during the blast off?

938
01:18:55,607 --> 01:18:59,899
But then we would see a drastic temperature drop.
- Comrades,

939
01:19:00,107 --> 01:19:02,191
their pulse and blood pressure are decreasing.

940
01:19:02,357 --> 01:19:04,399
The risk of oxygen poisoning is extremely high.

941
01:19:04,607 --> 01:19:07,523
We need a blueprint of the central ceiling zone.

942
01:19:07,690 --> 01:19:09,107
The most detailed.

943
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:16,565
Almaz, most likely there is...

944
01:19:16,732 --> 01:19:21,191
"a micro fissure. It's useless trying to
search for it, it's not dangerous by itself"

945
01:19:21,357 --> 01:19:26,316
"But the system has detected the leak
and automatically started pumping oxygen"

946
01:19:26,481 --> 01:19:29,274
"The compensation detector can only
be turned off manually"

947
01:19:29,481 --> 01:19:31,149
"You'll have to disassemble something"

948
01:19:31,316 --> 01:19:35,357
Copy.
- Sergey Pavlovich! We must not do it!
Everything is under voltage there.

949
01:19:35,523 --> 01:19:38,857
Do you have a better idea?
Almaz,

950
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:41,773
"in the middle of the ceiling right above you,"

951
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:44,523
"the compensation leakage detector..."

952
01:19:45,149 --> 01:19:48,316
"is next to the pressure relief valve"

953
01:19:50,191 --> 01:19:53,316
"You have to cut open the panel"

954
01:19:53,523 --> 01:19:55,815
This is a gamble.
Remember...

955
01:19:56,024 --> 01:20:00,773
during assemblage, a technician died.
And he was a qualified specialist.

956
01:20:09,316 --> 01:20:11,481
Do you see the density of wiring?

957
01:20:11,648 --> 01:20:13,940
And they have neither tools nor light.

958
01:20:15,274 --> 01:20:16,732
My God.

959
01:20:19,899 --> 01:20:21,815
Zarya, we've cut the panel.

960
01:20:21,982 --> 01:20:24,191
"The sensor system is behind the cables"

961
01:20:24,815 --> 01:20:29,899
"To get to it, you need to cut
the binding holding the wires"

962
01:20:30,065 --> 01:20:31,481
Copy, Zarya.

963
01:20:32,191 --> 01:20:33,815
Lyosha, shine it here.

964
01:20:34,481 --> 01:20:35,607
What will happen to them?

965
01:20:36,065 --> 01:20:37,857
Numbness of the limbs at the beginning.

966
01:20:39,607 --> 01:20:41,940
Then painful muscle cramps.

967
01:20:42,107 --> 01:20:46,356
All of that amid a background of partial
hearing loss and visual hallucinations.

968
01:20:48,899 --> 01:20:51,232
Stop! Easy... Easy...

969
01:20:52,899 --> 01:20:54,648
Hold on, hold on...

970
01:20:56,065 --> 01:20:58,024
Carefully.

971
01:21:00,607 --> 01:21:02,232
Let me do it.

972
01:21:02,815 --> 01:21:04,232
And you hold the light.

973
01:21:04,523 --> 01:21:07,107
Finally, they will fall asleep.

974
01:21:07,274 --> 01:21:09,732
Fall asleep? That's all?

975
01:21:11,232 --> 01:21:12,565
Exactly.

976
01:21:13,398 --> 01:21:14,815
That's all.

977
01:21:15,565 --> 01:21:16,481
Almaz,

978
01:21:17,107 --> 01:21:18,565
I'll do it.

979
01:21:19,732 --> 01:21:21,690
"Almaz, do you hear me?"

980
01:21:21,857 --> 01:21:24,899
Hold on. Hold on, Pasha.

981
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:27,982
"Almaz!"

982
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:29,773
"Do do you hear me?"

983
01:21:34,398 --> 01:21:35,732
"Almaz!"

984
01:21:37,398 --> 01:21:38,940
"Almaz, do you hear me?"

985
01:21:39,107 --> 01:21:41,523
Pasha, you're shining the light so well.

986
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:45,107
Evenly...so bright.

987
01:21:47,274 --> 01:21:49,982
Good. That's good.

988
01:21:50,732 --> 01:21:51,773
Zarya,

989
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,773
I have visual. I have visual.

990
01:21:58,274 --> 01:21:59,315
I can see the sensor.

991
01:21:59,523 --> 01:22:01,690
"Very good! Now comes the important thing"

992
01:22:03,982 --> 01:22:06,149
"Do you see the yellow cable?"

993
01:22:06,315 --> 01:22:09,732
"Unplug it. It's behind the nest of wires"

994
01:22:11,232 --> 01:22:13,940
"Do you hear me? Reply"

995
01:22:14,107 --> 01:22:15,481
Zarya, repeat.

996
01:22:15,648 --> 01:22:17,440
"Behind the nest of wires"

997
01:22:17,607 --> 01:22:18,607
Repeat, Zarya!

998
01:22:18,773 --> 01:22:22,107
"Unplug the yellow.. behind the nest of wires"

999
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:25,356
"Do you hear me?"

1000
01:22:25,523 --> 01:22:26,690
The nest.

1001
01:22:28,232 --> 01:22:30,232
So that's where it lives.

1002
01:22:30,398 --> 01:22:32,065
"I did not understand you, Almaz"

1003
01:22:32,273 --> 01:22:34,523
That's where it sleeps.
That's her house.

1004
01:22:34,732 --> 01:22:36,690
"What house?"

1005
01:22:37,690 --> 01:22:38,523

1006
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:40,607
"I did not understand you Almaz. Repeat"

1007
01:22:40,773 --> 01:22:42,107
We'll unplug it.

1008
01:22:42,273 --> 01:22:43,191
"Do you have it?"

1009
01:22:43,356 --> 01:22:44,315
Where is your house?

1010
01:22:46,481 --> 01:22:48,065
"Have you unplugged it? Almaz?"

1011
01:22:52,191 --> 01:22:53,523
Ok, I've found it.

1012
01:22:58,191 --> 01:22:59,523
Hold on, Pasha.

1013
01:23:13,398 --> 01:23:15,065
"Almaz!"

1014
01:23:16,315 --> 01:23:18,690
"Almaz, do you hear me?"

1015
01:23:21,273 --> 01:23:25,982
"Don't be silent, speak!
Have you unplugged it? Almaz!"

1016
01:23:34,565 --> 01:23:37,815
"Almaz, Come in please!"

1017
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:53,231
Almaz, Almaz...

1018
01:23:53,398 --> 01:23:56,565
There is no signal anymore.
They are in the dead zone.

1019
01:23:57,607 --> 01:24:00,732
The system of automatic orientation...

1020
01:24:00,899 --> 01:24:05,231
will run before escaping the dead zone.
Cycle 4 will bring them down safely.

1021
01:24:09,107 --> 01:24:11,273
Do they have a chance?

1022
01:24:40,648 --> 01:24:42,065
Mama?
- Yes?

1023
01:24:43,690 --> 01:24:46,440
Is it night in space too?

1024
01:24:46,607 --> 01:24:49,065
Yes. Go to sleep.

1025
01:24:51,648 --> 01:24:53,982
Is papa sleeping now too?

1026
01:24:55,398 --> 01:24:57,231
Certainly.

1027
01:24:58,857 --> 01:25:01,024
We all have to sleep.

1028
01:25:10,106 --> 01:25:12,024
When I wake up,

1029
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,648
will papa have landed then?

1030
01:25:19,690 --> 01:25:21,398
He will try.

1031
01:25:24,982 --> 01:25:27,440
He will try very hard.

1032
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:43,190

1033
01:26:49,231 --> 01:26:50,732
22ND HOUR OF FLIGHT

1034
01:26:51,148 --> 01:26:55,273
25 MINUTES AFTER ACTIVATION
OF THE AUTOMATC LANDING

1035
01:27:04,273 --> 01:27:09,356
We've been waiting for a signal,
but it's been silent.
There is no visual contact either.

1036
01:27:09,523 --> 01:27:11,481
Disgusting.

1037
01:27:12,815 --> 01:27:15,857
A crowd of strong healthy men
sitting like couch potatoes.

1038
01:27:16,023 --> 01:27:18,565
And sighing like it's a funeral.

1039
01:27:19,481 --> 01:27:22,773
If we cannot help our comrades...

1040
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:26,315
we can at least not hold a premature funeral!

1041
01:27:26,523 --> 01:27:29,899
Please, coffee for everybody. And me too.
Strong coffee.

1042
01:27:30,481 --> 01:27:33,356
Look, let's think logically.

1043
01:27:33,648 --> 01:27:36,190
The ship should have landed 23 minutes ago.

1044
01:27:36,356 --> 01:27:39,773
Perhaps during the re-entry into
the atmosphere it went off course...

1045
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:42,356
and it ended up in an unplanned area.

1046
01:27:42,523 --> 01:27:45,398
You're repeating yourself, Boris Viktorovich.

1047
01:27:45,565 --> 01:27:47,440
"Probably, perhaps, it seems..."

1048
01:27:47,607 --> 01:27:51,732
Give me the calculations for all landing possibilities.

1049
01:27:51,899 --> 01:27:55,023
Copy. Prepare the calculations.
- We are running out of time.

1050
01:27:55,690 --> 01:27:58,815
Let's send some aircraft to
search from the air.

1051
01:27:58,981 --> 01:28:02,106
Sergey Pavlovich, there is a call from Kremlin.
They want to congratulate the successful...

1052
01:28:02,273 --> 01:28:04,899
They will call back.
- Their parameters!

1053
01:28:06,231 --> 01:28:09,106
They are alive! They are alive!

1054
01:28:09,565 --> 01:28:12,231
We have contact again!
- Signal, there is a signal!

1055
01:28:13,815 --> 01:28:16,190
"This is Almaz, over"

1056
01:28:16,356 --> 01:28:18,773
Tell them, Korolyov left to
meet the cosmonauts.

1057
01:28:18,939 --> 01:28:20,899
Almaz! We're here.

1058
01:28:21,607 --> 01:28:23,106
We can hear you.

1059
01:28:23,273 --> 01:28:25,690
We are you? We are you, Eagles?

1060
01:28:25,981 --> 01:28:29,106
In our seats, we didn't go anywhere.

1061
01:28:29,273 --> 01:28:31,273
Zarya, this is Almaz.

1062
01:28:32,023 --> 01:28:34,356
We're fine.

1063
01:28:34,523 --> 01:28:36,523
But Cycle 4 has not been activated.

1064
01:28:37,148 --> 01:28:39,981
"I repeat, Cycle 4 has not been activated"

1065
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:44,815
"We are still in orbit and have
just left the dead zone"

1066
01:28:44,981 --> 01:28:48,148
Sergey Pavlovich, I can not explain it.

1067
01:28:48,315 --> 01:28:50,815
Perhaps, the spin of the ship was too strong.

1068
01:28:51,023 --> 01:28:53,106
This is an extraordinary situation.

1069
01:28:53,315 --> 01:28:55,939
Oh, is it really? It's not the first
time you could not explain it?

1070
01:28:56,106 --> 01:28:58,315
Has anyone counted?
- I did!

1071
01:29:02,565 --> 01:29:06,064
Try to restart the system.
- Restart is being prepared.

1072
01:29:06,231 --> 01:29:08,773
Land them in the next orbit.

1073
01:29:09,481 --> 01:29:12,523
We don't have a right to land them in the next orbit.

1074
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:15,398
The ship will be passing in rival territory.

1075
01:29:15,565 --> 01:29:17,898
The boys should be returned to Earth.

1076
01:29:18,064 --> 01:29:20,106
We'll take care of the area later.

1077
01:29:20,273 --> 01:29:21,690
"Zarya, this is Almaz"

1078
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:26,148
Permission to switch the ship
to manual control immediately...

1079
01:29:26,315 --> 01:29:29,273
and implement the landing
right now, over.

1080
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:34,148
"Almaz, we need to calculate the
landing point for that. We don't
have enough time for that now"

1081
01:29:34,315 --> 01:29:38,064
Sergey Pavlovich! Don't worry!
We have all the calculations.

1082
01:29:38,231 --> 01:29:40,523
So, I guesstimated here...

1083
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:44,732
We'll land in the Urals.
Somewhere in the Perm area.
- Lyosha,

1084
01:29:45,023 --> 01:29:47,190
Be reasonable. Is that calculations?

1085
01:29:47,356 --> 01:29:49,607
"He guesstimated somewhere in the Perm area."

1086
01:29:50,231 --> 01:29:53,273
On the other hand, they both
are experienced pilots.

1087
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:57,856
But nobody ever landed a
spaceship in manual mode.

1088
01:29:58,023 --> 01:30:02,607
Manual control, it's like, I don't know...
a straw for a drowning.

1089
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:06,106
Exclusively only for desperate situations.

1090
01:30:06,732 --> 01:30:09,398
And what is the situation now?
- Sergey Pavlovich,

1091
01:30:09,939 --> 01:30:11,814
One minute please.

1092
01:30:12,690 --> 01:30:13,814
That's it.

1093
01:30:15,398 --> 01:30:16,939
The meeting has begun.

1094
01:30:19,231 --> 01:30:21,315
Now they will gather everyone.

1095
01:30:22,190 --> 01:30:25,064
Then they will appoint a chairman.

1096
01:30:25,648 --> 01:30:29,273
Then they will listen to a speaker
and then they will begin to argue.

1097
01:30:30,064 --> 01:30:34,190
And you asked me why I didn't reply?
I would be dead by now.

1098
01:30:38,148 --> 01:30:40,356
Come on, we will land this clunker, Pash.

1099
01:30:40,523 --> 01:30:43,231
We landed a lot worse rust buckets in our day.

1100
01:30:43,898 --> 01:30:45,607
You will land it, won't you?

1101
01:30:49,231 --> 01:30:51,939
We don't have any other option.
- Why not?

1102
01:30:52,565 --> 01:30:56,481
Either we land manually
or they will leave us in orbit.

1103
01:31:02,565 --> 01:31:05,148
In short we do as we are told to do.

1104
01:31:08,523 --> 01:31:10,981
You think they won't permit it?

1105
01:31:13,481 --> 01:31:15,273
I wouldn't.

1106
01:31:15,523 --> 01:31:18,856
We are not sisters of mercy, Sergey Pavlovich.

1107
01:31:19,106 --> 01:31:22,939
State secrets are not subjects for experiments.

1108
01:31:23,106 --> 01:31:25,690
Honestly, I don't understand you.

1109
01:31:26,814 --> 01:31:30,398
Or maybe I do, but that's even worse.

1110
01:31:30,565 --> 01:31:33,607
Are you proposing to keep them in orbit?

1111
01:31:34,315 --> 01:31:37,148
Did I get you right?
- We are at war.

1112
01:31:37,315 --> 01:31:41,481
Cold, but quite real.
What if they land in Europe?

1113
01:31:41,772 --> 01:31:43,481
Or, God forbid, fly into China.

1114
01:31:43,648 --> 01:31:47,148
All the secrets of our space program
will fall into the hands of the enemy.

1115
01:31:47,315 --> 01:31:51,106
And why should they die?
As a precaution? If it goes wrong?

1116
01:31:51,273 --> 01:31:55,398
So they do not land somewhere
where they should not land?
- They are soldiers.

1117
01:31:55,565 --> 01:32:00,148
And soldiers have to be ready to die
in the interest of their state.
- I see.

1118
01:32:01,315 --> 01:32:03,148
Ok, well...

1119
01:32:03,315 --> 01:32:05,148
The idea is not new,

1120
01:32:05,315 --> 01:32:07,814
but constructive. Thank you. Many Thanks.

1121
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:11,273
I'll have to think about it.

1122
01:32:23,898 --> 01:32:24,981
Almaz!

1123
01:32:25,731 --> 01:32:27,398
"This is Zarya"

1124
01:32:28,231 --> 01:32:30,731
"Switch to..."

1125
01:32:35,814 --> 01:32:37,148
manual control.

1126
01:32:37,315 --> 01:32:40,856
"Start making your spacesuits pressure resistant"

1127
01:32:41,273 --> 01:32:44,356
Zarya, copy that.
Making spacesuits pressure resistant.

1128
01:32:44,523 --> 01:32:47,023
It's good that you're not
the one who decides.

1129
01:32:55,398 --> 01:32:58,315
Zarya, I repeat, the
landing area is approximately...

1130
01:32:58,523 --> 01:33:00,231
Lyosha, they can't hear you.

1131
01:33:00,398 --> 01:33:02,689
They'll find us somehow.
If we land.

1132
01:33:02,856 --> 01:33:05,607
I say we land right on Red Square.
- Enough talk,

1133
01:33:06,356 --> 01:33:07,939
start stabilization of the spaceship.

1134
01:33:32,148 --> 01:33:35,856
Looks like we're in position.
- See! You can do it when you want to.

1135
01:33:36,023 --> 01:33:38,772
All we need now is to make it to Earth.

1136
01:33:42,148 --> 01:33:43,190
Lyosha.

1137
01:33:44,939 --> 01:33:46,440
I'm crammed in.

1138
01:33:47,190 --> 01:33:49,606
And how... how am I supposed to see?

1139
01:33:50,814 --> 01:33:52,273
Maybe I should go out?

1140
01:33:55,647 --> 01:33:57,064
You direct me.

1141
01:33:58,356 --> 01:33:59,356
I'm ready!

1142
01:34:01,190 --> 01:34:02,564
To the west.
- Done.

1143
01:34:04,023 --> 01:34:05,564
To the southwest.

1144
01:34:06,731 --> 01:34:07,523
Done.

1145
01:34:08,772 --> 01:34:11,356
North.
- Done.
- No, no! Northwest.

1146
01:34:11,564 --> 01:34:14,231
North or Northwest?
- Easy, easy, easy...

1147
01:34:14,689 --> 01:34:15,939
And now in a clockwise direction.

1148
01:34:20,689 --> 01:34:23,023
Gently.

1149
01:34:26,856 --> 01:34:28,148
And now west.
- Done.

1150
01:34:28,731 --> 01:34:29,939
Too much! Back it up!

1151
01:34:30,148 --> 01:34:32,023
Stop! Stop! Start over.

1152
01:34:35,231 --> 01:34:36,564
Ready.

1153
01:34:37,106 --> 01:34:38,898
West.

1154
01:34:39,064 --> 01:34:39,814
West!

1155
01:34:42,064 --> 01:34:45,398
Pasha, we're losing time.
- That won't work, Lyosh. I'll do it myself.

1156
01:34:45,564 --> 01:34:47,315
What are you doing?
The gravity center will shift.

1157
01:34:47,522 --> 01:34:49,273
Get up from your seat.

1158
01:34:51,689 --> 01:34:53,231
And where should I go now?

1159
01:34:53,606 --> 01:34:55,231
Go there, under the porthole.

1160
01:34:55,647 --> 01:34:56,731
I'll try to.

1161
01:34:57,772 --> 01:34:59,315
Ok, hold my legs.

1162
01:34:59,606 --> 01:35:01,106
I'm holding.

1163
01:35:03,231 --> 01:35:04,315
Lyosha, I'll take aim.

1164
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:11,106
And we'll very carefully...
gently as little mice...
sit back in our seats.

1165
01:35:11,315 --> 01:35:14,522
Do it quick, buddy.
Otherwise we'll land in China.
- Don't rush me.

1166
01:35:15,647 --> 01:35:18,856
If I slip up, we'll fly into space.

1167
01:35:37,064 --> 01:35:40,023
Easy. Back to the seats.

1168
01:36:03,190 --> 01:36:04,731
Are we still on course?

1169
01:36:05,606 --> 01:36:07,273
We shifted.
- How much?

1170
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:10,315
About 7 degrees already.
- Damn it. And the nitrogen indicator?

1171
01:36:10,898 --> 01:36:12,148
It's almost zero.

1172
01:36:13,564 --> 01:36:15,190
Lyosha, are you wearing your seatbelt?

1173
01:36:33,315 --> 01:36:35,814
The navigation system has been activated.

1174
01:36:35,981 --> 01:36:38,231
It'd be great to know
where they will end up...

1175
01:36:38,981 --> 01:36:42,689
We'll end up in jail, if anything.
But they will land.

1176
01:36:42,856 --> 01:36:44,856
The meter indicates a tilt.

1177
01:36:45,023 --> 01:36:47,856
I seems they left their seats,
to be able to navigate better.

1178
01:36:48,023 --> 01:36:50,772
And when they sat back,
the gravity center shifted.

1179
01:36:50,981 --> 01:36:52,315
What does that mean?

1180
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:56,190
That their trajectory could change.
- Sergey Pavlovich, may I?

1181
01:36:57,190 --> 01:36:59,397
With the inclination over...

1182
01:36:59,772 --> 01:37:01,439
by six or seven degrees,

1183
01:37:02,106 --> 01:37:05,273
they will get into the atmosphere
at a very acute angle.

1184
01:37:05,439 --> 01:37:07,731
The spaceship might ricochet off
and be thrown back into orbit.

1185
01:37:07,898 --> 01:37:12,898
Gravity will pull them back
down eventually.

1186
01:37:13,064 --> 01:37:16,148
But that won't be soon.
Boris Viktorovich,

1187
01:37:16,356 --> 01:37:19,106
calculate all possible landing positions.

1188
01:37:19,273 --> 01:37:20,522
Stay focused.

1189
01:37:20,814 --> 01:37:21,981
Let's wait...

1190
01:37:23,106 --> 01:37:25,315
for the transmitter signal...

1191
01:37:26,023 --> 01:37:29,814
and hope... for the best.

1192
01:37:44,023 --> 01:37:45,689
Is it Thursday?

1193
01:37:46,315 --> 01:37:47,731
Or Friday?

1194
01:37:48,606 --> 01:37:50,273
I have no idea.

1195
01:37:52,606 --> 01:37:54,856
You think the children have got up?

1196
01:37:57,439 --> 01:37:59,397
I wonder if Vika will go to kindergarten today...

1197
01:38:01,023 --> 01:38:02,856
or if she has a cold again?

1198
01:38:06,814 --> 01:38:08,564
Lyosha, don't worry.

1199
01:38:08,981 --> 01:38:11,397
If I slipped up, then in about three years...

1200
01:38:11,564 --> 01:38:13,731
gravity will bring us down.

1201
01:38:13,898 --> 01:38:15,981
We'll be buried with honours.

1202
01:38:23,314 --> 01:38:24,689
So...

1203
01:38:27,231 --> 01:38:28,606
Let's eat something.

1204
01:38:33,023 --> 01:38:34,273

1205
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:37,522
How about that! What delicacies!

1206
01:38:40,814 --> 01:38:42,023
Borscht.

1207
01:38:43,898 --> 01:38:45,355
It's a pity there's no garlic.

1208
01:38:53,981 --> 01:38:55,480
Do you want some?

1209
01:39:05,522 --> 01:39:06,981
Lyosha!

1210
01:39:11,731 --> 01:39:12,689
Seems...

1211
01:39:12,689 --> 01:39:13,647
we have gravity.

1212
01:39:15,272 --> 01:39:18,272
Hold the delicacies!
We're going home!

1213
01:39:19,272 --> 01:39:21,355
Understood, Comrade Commander!

1214
01:39:32,190 --> 01:39:33,355
Blasting off reserve retro engine.

1215
01:39:36,939 --> 01:39:38,564
Separation confirmed.

1216
01:39:39,314 --> 01:39:41,439
Get ready for instrument module
separation blast off!

1217
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:48,064
Partial, the module hasn't been separated.

1218
01:39:48,230 --> 01:39:50,106
Lyosha, hold on! It's going to spin.

1219
01:40:34,647 --> 01:40:37,397
Ok! Ok! It came apart!

1220
01:42:09,814 --> 01:42:11,272
Are alive?

1221
01:42:14,939 --> 01:42:16,105
Pasha?

1222
01:42:27,063 --> 01:42:28,522
Pasha...
- I'm still alive!

1223
01:42:28,689 --> 01:42:30,230
You fool!

1224
01:42:30,689 --> 01:42:33,230
Were you scared?
- Why'd you do that?

1225
01:42:33,397 --> 01:42:35,439
Done?
- Yeah.

1226
01:42:39,272 --> 01:42:40,772
Let's go.

1227
01:42:41,898 --> 01:42:44,480
Ready? It will be loud.

1228
01:42:45,105 --> 01:42:46,439
Wait a sec.

1229
01:43:07,272 --> 01:43:09,731
So are you ready?
- Yeah.

1230
01:45:06,814 --> 01:45:09,980
THREE HOURS AFTER LANDING

1231
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:19,063
"This is Alpha 18. I did not receive a signal"

1232
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:23,522
"The search in section 28 is finished"

1233
01:45:23,689 --> 01:45:27,606
"No traces of a landing"

1234
01:45:27,772 --> 01:45:30,230
"We are at section 24, no signal"

1235
01:45:30,397 --> 01:45:33,439
"Section 22, still nothing"

1236
01:45:33,606 --> 01:45:37,022
"In the entire short-wave range, no signal"

1237
01:45:37,938 --> 01:45:39,980
"Continue searching"

1238
01:45:40,397 --> 01:45:41,689
Why the hell can't we...

1239
01:45:42,272 --> 01:45:44,772
with all the achievements of Soviet science...

1240
01:45:44,980 --> 01:45:47,855
detect even a single transmitter
in a particular area?

1241
01:45:49,439 --> 01:45:52,147
The signal disappeared during re-entry
into the atmosphere.

1242
01:45:52,314 --> 01:45:54,689
That could mean...
- Not "could!"

1243
01:45:54,855 --> 01:45:57,189
I want specific details.

1244
01:45:58,397 --> 01:45:59,772
Sergey Pavlovich,

1245
01:46:00,689 --> 01:46:03,606
Apparently, they landed somewhere
that we didn't expect.

1246
01:46:03,772 --> 01:46:06,689
A full-scaled search operation
has been deployed.

1247
01:46:07,022 --> 01:46:10,480
You need to calm down, and get some rest.

1248
01:46:10,689 --> 01:46:12,480
I'll get rest when we've found them.

1249
01:46:12,647 --> 01:46:14,397
Does anyone have any thoughts?

1250
01:46:15,022 --> 01:46:16,397
First possibility,

1251
01:46:16,564 --> 01:46:19,855
the beacon might be broken
from a hard landing.

1252
01:46:20,022 --> 01:46:23,647
Second, they might have damaged it
when they were cutting the upholstery.

1253
01:46:23,814 --> 01:46:27,689
They have a portable transmitter for
that case to send signals manually.

1254
01:46:27,897 --> 01:46:30,230
So why can't we detect it?

1255
01:46:30,439 --> 01:46:32,980
The batteries of the transmitter
do not work at low temperatures.

1256
01:46:33,189 --> 01:46:35,230
So what? It wouldn't dawn upon them
how to warm a battery?

1257
01:46:35,439 --> 01:46:37,813
First they would have to work
out how to warm themselves.

1258
01:46:38,105 --> 01:46:41,689
The spacesuits, unplugged from the life support
system, are not designed for low temperatures.

1259
01:46:41,855 --> 01:46:45,480
Also they cannot take shelter in the capsule.
It will be like a freezer in an hour.

1260
01:46:45,647 --> 01:46:49,147
Perhaps, the radio waves just cannot pass through.

1261
01:46:49,314 --> 01:46:53,522
The quality of a short-wave signal depends a lot
on the terrain and weather conditions.

1262
01:46:53,689 --> 01:46:55,647
Let's assume,

1263
01:46:55,813 --> 01:46:58,105
they turned out to be
in adverse weather conditions.

1264
01:46:59,355 --> 01:47:01,189
How long can they last?

1265
01:47:02,689 --> 01:47:03,980
A day.

1266
01:47:06,063 --> 01:47:08,272

1267
01:47:21,606 --> 01:47:24,355
This forest. It's blocking the signal.

1268
01:47:26,355 --> 01:47:27,606
But we can use Morse code.

1269
01:47:28,314 --> 01:47:30,606
We'll make it with good old Morse code.

1270
01:47:32,439 --> 01:47:35,022
Morse code is very reliable.

1271
01:47:35,731 --> 01:47:38,731
You'd better warm up, Alexey.

1272
01:47:39,522 --> 01:47:40,813
I'll be ok.

1273
01:48:41,147 --> 01:48:42,980

1274
01:48:44,730 --> 01:48:47,147
B-H... B-H, B-H, B-H.

1275
01:48:47,314 --> 01:48:50,105
What's does that mean, "B-H, B-H?"

1276
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:51,688
Equals...?

1277
01:48:54,606 --> 01:48:56,105
Equals...?

1278
01:48:58,897 --> 01:49:03,189
Oh, "Everything normal".
- Do you mind?

1279
01:49:03,355 --> 01:49:07,063
They've landed, our eagles! B-H!
- What?
- It's B-H! "Everything normal"!

1280
01:49:07,272 --> 01:49:08,897
So everything is normal?
- Wait!

1281
01:49:09,105 --> 01:49:11,647
It's just starting to become interesting.
A rescue operation.

1282
01:49:11,813 --> 01:49:13,355
Don't worry, they will rescue them without you.

1283
01:49:15,022 --> 01:49:17,688
They will show everything on TV tomorrow.
- Ahh, why do you always...

1284
01:49:17,855 --> 01:49:21,355
Go, go. Enough intercepting state secrets.

1285
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:30,063
The Kremlin...

1286
01:49:31,063 --> 01:49:32,980
...is waiting for an official statement.

1287
01:49:34,022 --> 01:49:36,938
We have to do it tomorrow by 10 AM.

1288
01:49:37,272 --> 01:49:39,646
We have nothing to say yet.

1289
01:49:48,314 --> 01:49:49,564
Sergey Pavlovich,

1290
01:49:50,147 --> 01:49:52,147
You need to rest.

1291
01:49:52,314 --> 01:49:53,980
Nothing depends on you now.

1292
01:49:54,147 --> 01:49:58,230
There is a plenty of time until the morning,
if we don't waste it.

1293
01:49:58,855 --> 01:50:01,189
Comrade lieutenant general! Permission to speak.

1294
01:50:01,355 --> 01:50:04,855
The weather report has come. Heavy snowfall
is expected all over the Ural ridge.

1295
01:50:05,230 --> 01:50:06,938
An arctic storm is moving in.

1296
01:50:07,105 --> 01:50:09,855
The temperature will fall to -31 F at night.

1297
01:50:10,022 --> 01:50:11,272
At night?

1298
01:50:12,189 --> 01:50:14,646
But it's still day now, right?

1299
01:50:17,605 --> 01:50:19,938
It's still day.

1300
01:50:21,397 --> 01:50:24,272
SIX HOURS AFTER LANDING

1301
01:50:26,897 --> 01:50:30,105
If they got the signal,
they'll need about two hours.

1302
01:50:30,272 --> 01:50:32,605
That means they will be here soon.

1303
01:50:32,771 --> 01:50:35,230
They'll be here soon. Soon.

1304
01:50:36,189 --> 01:50:37,605
If they got it.

1305
01:50:43,522 --> 01:50:44,730
Here.

1306
01:50:45,522 --> 01:50:46,897
It's your turn.

1307
01:50:49,105 --> 01:50:53,439
Relax. We knew what we were getting into.

1308
01:50:57,980 --> 01:50:59,855
If they find the logbook,

1309
01:51:00,439 --> 01:51:02,897
the mission will be completed.

1310
01:51:03,439 --> 01:51:05,646
What do you mean "completed"?

1311
01:51:05,813 --> 01:51:07,397
Did you forget about your girls?

1312
01:51:09,771 --> 01:51:12,022
They're ironing your uniform right now...

1313
01:51:12,189 --> 01:51:14,439
preparing to meet their father alive.

1314
01:51:14,605 --> 01:51:16,480
You understand? Alive.

1315
01:51:17,272 --> 01:51:20,521
Not a frozen piece of mammoth shit.

1316
01:51:20,688 --> 01:51:22,355
No, my friend.

1317
01:51:23,688 --> 01:51:25,230
Give me a hand.

1318
01:51:26,521 --> 01:51:28,063

1319
01:51:29,646 --> 01:51:31,230
My family won't forgive me for this.

1320
01:51:32,147 --> 01:51:34,605
Who will take Vika to school for the first time?

1321
01:51:37,189 --> 01:51:38,646
Listen, Comrade Belyaev,

1322
01:51:39,314 --> 01:51:40,897
nobody has ordered us to give up.

1323
01:51:41,272 --> 01:51:42,646
Don't get bored, I'll be back soon.

1324
01:51:59,646 --> 01:52:01,038

1325
01:52:20,147 --> 01:52:22,022
Send the following command:

1326
01:52:22,938 --> 01:52:25,272
Put everything into the air that flies.

1327
01:52:25,439 --> 01:52:28,771
Double the search area.
- Yes, sir.

1328
01:52:31,272 --> 01:52:32,605
General Kamanin's order...

1329
01:52:33,855 --> 01:52:37,022
Please send the text now
for the official message.

1330
01:52:37,189 --> 01:52:39,688
Which one, Nikolay Petrovich?

1331
01:52:39,855 --> 01:52:41,230
Both of them.

1332
01:52:45,105 --> 01:52:46,314
Good evening, comrades.

1333
01:52:57,314 --> 01:53:00,063

1334
01:53:00,230 --> 01:53:02,005

1335
01:53:07,397 --> 01:53:09,897

1336
01:53:11,771 --> 01:53:13,479
May I have some water?

1337
01:53:44,813 --> 01:53:45,855
I'm ready.

1338
01:53:51,314 --> 01:53:52,897

1339
01:53:57,189 --> 01:53:59,479
<i>On the 18th of March...</i>

1340
01:54:00,438 --> 01:54:03,438
<i>in the year 1965...</i>

1341
01:54:04,980 --> 01:54:07,105

<i>sent the Voskhod 2 spacecraft...</i>

1344
01:54:12,897 --> 01:54:16,813
<i>into orbit around planet Earth.</i>

1345
01:54:26,813 --> 01:54:30,813
<i>It was manned by two pilots
and cosmonauts of the USSR,</i>

1346
01:54:31,605 --> 01:54:34,730
<i>Lieutenant Colonel Pavel Ivanovich Belyayev...</i>

1347
01:54:37,897 --> 01:54:41,771
<i>and Major Alexey Arkhipovich Leonov.</i>

1348
01:54:43,605 --> 01:54:45,855
<i>After the test flight,</i>

1349
01:54:46,314 --> 01:54:48,938
<i>which lasted more than a day,</i>

1350
01:54:56,105 --> 01:54:59,230
<i>in the process of returning to earth,</i>

1351
01:54:59,438 --> 01:55:01,646
<i>the ropes of the parachutes became twisted...</i>

1352
01:55:02,230 --> 01:55:06,438
<i>and the space capsule continued

1353
01:55:06,605 --> 01:55:09,272
<i>at a high rate of speed.</i>

1354
01:55:13,771 --> 01:55:15,980
<i>This ultimately resulted...</i>

1355
01:55:17,605 --> 01:55:20,563
<i>in the death of the crew.</i>

1356
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:26,938
Have you guys completely lost your minds?

1357
01:55:29,147 --> 01:55:33,105
Hey! Where are you?

1358
01:55:33,938 --> 01:55:35,980
Are you all stupid?

1359
01:55:36,897 --> 01:55:39,813
We are alive here! Hey!

1360
01:55:40,105 --> 01:55:42,105
We're alive here!

1361
01:55:43,563 --> 01:55:45,688
Are you deaf or what?

1362
01:55:47,438 --> 01:55:48,646
Hey! We're alive!

1363
01:55:49,230 --> 01:55:53,354
Hey! We're alive! We're alive!

1364
01:56:23,521 --> 01:56:25,855
<i>...untimely death...</i>

1365
01:56:26,022 --> 01:56:29,646
<i>of the remarkable researchers and cosmonauts...</i>

1366
01:56:29,813 --> 01:56:32,563
<i>Pavel Ivanovich Belyayev...</i>

1367
01:56:33,313 --> 01:56:36,646

01:56:37,605 --> 01:56:39,938

1369
01:56:40,147 --> 01:56:43,229
<i>and irreparable loss...</i>

1370
01:56:43,938 --> 01:56:47,730
<i>for the whole of the Soviet people.</i>

1371
01:56:52,855 --> 01:56:55,813
<i>They have been awarded the title of...</i>

1372
01:56:56,521 --> 01:56:59,022
<i>Heroes of Soviet Union...</i>

1373
01:57:02,229 --> 01:57:04,022
<i>posthumously.</i>

1374
01:57:06,980 --> 01:57:08,605
Pasha!

1375
01:57:21,897 --> 01:57:23,188
Pasha!

1376
01:57:27,771 --> 01:57:30,022
Pasha! Pasha!

1377
01:57:32,313 --> 01:57:34,730
Are you Ok? Don't fall asleep!

1378
01:57:35,022 --> 01:57:38,313
Hey, Pasha! Pasha! Don't fall asleep!

1379
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:41,188
Don't fall asleep, Pasha!

1380
01:57:42,605 --> 01:57:43,646
That's enough, Lyosha.

1381
01:57:45,813 --> 01:57:47,646
Pavel Ivanovich.

1382
01:57:47,897 --> 01:57:51,188
Alright.
Do you know what we're going to do now?

1383
01:57:51,354 --> 01:57:53,271
We will write you a speech
for the journalists.

1384
01:57:53,438 --> 01:57:56,313
Because you're always standing like a...
- You'll handle it yourself.

1385
01:57:56,479 --> 01:57:59,063
You're the hero now.
- Am I? Nah.

1386
01:57:59,229 --> 01:58:02,229
You were a hero when I still helping to farm cows.

1387
01:58:02,396 --> 01:58:04,105
You'd already been to war.

1388
01:58:04,271 --> 01:58:06,229
How many battles had you fought?

1389
01:58:06,396 --> 01:58:08,313
I was still dreaming about the sky.
- One.

1390
01:58:09,646 --> 01:58:11,229
One what?

1391
01:58:11,396 --> 01:58:13,354
One combat mission.

1392
01:58:13,521 --> 01:58:14,730
And...

1393
01:58:15,313 --> 01:58:18,146
I didn't even shoot.

1394
01:58:18,980 --> 01:58:21,688
The older guys fought,

1395
01:58:21,855 --> 01:58:25,063
and we younger guys, prepared
the planes and swept the runway.

1396
01:58:27,730 --> 01:58:30,396
And finally, when they gave me a flight...

1397
01:58:30,730 --> 01:58:33,605
I thought, now it's my turn!

1398
01:58:33,771 --> 01:58:36,146
Maybe I'll be useful for something.

1399
01:58:36,855 --> 01:58:39,521
The enemy didn't attack us.

1400
01:58:39,688 --> 01:58:42,521
We flew and returned...

1401
01:58:43,188 --> 01:58:45,313
back to the base.

1402
01:58:47,479 --> 01:58:51,605
And that was it.
On the next day they surrendered.

1403
01:58:52,354 --> 01:58:56,396
Well, here's your "hero" Pavel Belyaev.

1404
01:59:09,688 --> 01:59:13,646
Do you know why I went to flight school?

1405
01:59:13,813 --> 01:59:18,022
Why?
- The allowance was bigger than at the art Academy.

1406
01:59:18,188 --> 01:59:21,563
Right now I would be painting my pictures
and living carefree. But no!

1407
01:59:21,730 --> 01:59:25,771
Instead, the whole world has seen

1408
01:59:25,938 --> 01:59:29,062
how I dangled from a string in space.

1409
01:59:29,229 --> 01:59:34,396
Suit was inflated so much, I almost shit.
Here's the space conqueror Leonov!

1410
01:59:34,563 --> 01:59:37,354
Pashka, I'm sorry.

1411
01:59:38,354 --> 01:59:40,271
That I got you into this.

1412
01:59:40,438 --> 01:59:42,354
No...

1413
01:59:43,771 --> 01:59:45,438
It's good.

1414
01:59:46,313 --> 01:59:48,354
What's good?

1415
01:59:48,521 --> 01:59:50,730
It's good that you

1416
01:59:51,438 --> 01:59:53,605
didn't become an artist.

1417
01:59:53,771 --> 01:59:56,188
Otherwise, who else...

1418
01:59:56,354 --> 01:59:59,271
would I fly with?

1419
02:00:02,563 --> 02:00:05,271
Maybe we will fly again.

1420
02:00:07,062 --> 02:00:10,980
We do as we are told, Lyosha.

1421
02:00:11,146 --> 02:00:14,771
We do what we are told.

1422
02:00:46,354 --> 02:00:47,938
They've landed.

1423
02:00:48,104 --> 02:00:49,646
Successfully.

1424
02:00:49,813 --> 02:00:51,563
And they need help.

1425
02:00:51,730 --> 02:00:55,833
But nobody's coming to them.
- But they will come for you,

1426
02:00:55,979 --> 02:00:58,062
and you'll go to jail.

1427
02:00:58,855 --> 02:01:01,271
And I won't have anyone to ask for help.

1428
02:01:16,313 --> 02:01:17,730
I have to do it.

1429
02:01:34,521 --> 02:01:37,521
NINE HOURS AFTER LANDING

1430
02:01:38,021 --> 02:01:40,730
The weather has deteriorated.

1431
02:01:40,897 --> 02:01:43,104
I have to cancel the search.

1432
02:01:46,479 --> 02:01:48,229
I see.

1433
02:01:48,438 --> 02:01:51,688
As soon as the storm settles...
- Yes, yes of course.

1434
02:01:52,730 --> 02:01:56,021
We have to inform the families.

1435
02:01:57,188 --> 02:02:00,937
Sergey Pavlovich, maybe...
we shouldn't hurry?

1436
02:02:01,104 --> 02:02:03,271
But what do you want?

1437
02:02:03,438 --> 02:02:06,771
Do you want them to hear about it
from the radio announcer?

1438
02:02:08,146 --> 02:02:09,479
We have a signal!

1439
02:02:10,271 --> 02:02:12,813
Sergey Pavlovich, it seems...
we've got the signal.

1440
02:02:13,021 --> 02:02:15,354
What you mean, "it seems"?
- I'm sorry, comrade Lieutenant General.

1441
02:02:15,521 --> 02:02:17,646
There was a call from the committee.

1442
02:02:17,813 --> 02:02:20,021
Some radio hobbyist from Sakhalin
got in touch with them.

1443
02:02:20,188 --> 02:02:23,937
He says, he accidentally got a signal
from the cosmonauts.

1444
02:02:24,354 --> 02:02:26,271
Accidentally? How's that an accident?
- Accidentally?

1445
02:02:26,479 --> 02:02:29,979
A radio amateur? -Yes.
Sakhalin? -Yes.

1446
02:02:30,396 --> 02:02:32,979
Which section?
- According to the triangulation...

1447
02:02:33,188 --> 02:02:37,104
it turns out.. section 62.
- Do we have anyone at the 62nd?

1448
02:02:39,229 --> 02:02:41,521
Yes, we have one helicopter
within a mile from there.

1449
02:02:41,688 --> 02:02:43,438
Call him.
- Yes, sir.

1450
02:02:45,563 --> 02:02:49,479
"Craft 216! The signal from the cosmonauts
was located at the 62nd square"

1451
02:02:49,813 --> 02:02:53,021
You are the closest.
Try to gain visual contact.

1452
02:02:53,229 --> 02:02:57,021
"I repeat, try to gain visual contact"

1453
02:02:57,188 --> 02:02:58,937
This is 216.

1454
02:02:59,354 --> 02:03:02,229
I'm at section 62.

1455
02:03:02,438 --> 02:03:04,605
Very bad weather conditions.

1456
02:03:04,771 --> 02:03:07,979
Continue the search while you can.
- Yes, sir.

1457
02:03:19,062 --> 02:03:20,812
You hear it?

1458
02:03:26,271 --> 02:03:28,021
You hear it?

1459
02:03:30,396 --> 02:03:32,271
That's for us.

1460
02:03:32,979 --> 02:03:35,021
They've found us.

1461
02:03:38,354 --> 02:03:41,563
Where is... the flare gun?

1462
02:03:43,771 --> 02:03:45,313
Pasha.

1463
02:03:50,688 --> 02:03:52,646
Where's the flare gun?

1464
02:03:52,812 --> 02:03:53,896
Did I lose it?

1465
02:03:54,905 --> 02:03:56,812
Huh? I'm confused.

1466
02:04:00,104 --> 02:04:04,229
Commander, the tanks are almost dry.
We should get back, or we
might not make it to the base.

1467
02:04:05,854 --> 02:04:08,354
This is 216. Our tank is almost empty.

1468
02:04:09,730 --> 02:04:10,896
They have to get back.

1469
02:04:11,104 --> 02:04:13,605
Let them come back.
- Yes, sir.

1470
02:04:15,688 --> 02:04:18,646
216, return to base.

1471
02:04:22,354 --> 02:04:23,812
216,

1472
02:04:24,521 --> 02:04:26,937
This is Sergey Korolev.

1473
02:04:27,104 --> 02:04:28,730
What's your name?

1474
02:04:28,896 --> 02:04:30,146
"Major Markelov"

1475
02:04:31,062 --> 02:04:32,229
"And your first name?"

1476
02:04:32,396 --> 02:04:33,979
Vladimir.

1477
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:37,104
"Volodya, listen to me"

1478
02:04:37,563 --> 02:04:39,313
Somewhere in the forest,

1479
02:04:39,479 --> 02:04:40,937
between the trees,

1480
02:04:41,104 --> 02:04:42,479
hangs a parachute.

1481
02:04:42,646 --> 02:04:45,563
It's very big and noticeable.

1482
02:04:46,646 --> 02:04:49,563
Please, look closely.

1483
02:04:50,229 --> 02:04:52,146
It's hard not to notice it.

1484
02:04:52,979 --> 02:04:54,605
"Do you hear me?"

1485
02:04:54,770 --> 02:04:55,688
Yes.

1486
02:05:04,146 --> 02:05:08,229
What the... Where did I put it?

1487
02:05:08,438 --> 02:05:11,396
What are you doing?

1488
02:05:11,605 --> 02:05:13,062
Come on, help!

1489
02:05:13,896 --> 02:05:16,646
Lyosha, help, it froze.

1490
02:05:19,021 --> 02:05:21,313
Pashka!

1491
02:05:23,229 --> 02:05:26,979
Here you go. Hold on.

1492
02:05:27,729 --> 02:05:29,812
We are on emergency reserve.
We have to turn back.

1493
02:05:34,271 --> 02:05:37,271
Lyosha, send us a signal.
We can not see anything.

1494
02:05:37,605 --> 02:05:39,605
Hold on, Pasha.

1495
02:05:40,104 --> 02:05:41,979
You're the hero.

1496
02:05:42,438 --> 02:05:44,979
Wait... I'll help you.

1497
02:05:52,271 --> 02:05:53,313
Commander,

1498
02:05:53,563 --> 02:05:56,687
we have to turn back,
or we won't make it.

1499
02:05:56,854 --> 02:05:58,812
"This is 216"

1500
02:05:59,479 --> 02:06:01,645
"I have not seen a parachute"

1501
02:06:01,854 --> 02:06:03,729
"There's no signal from the cosmonauts"

1502
02:06:04,854 --> 02:06:07,521
We tried.
We are sorry.

1503
02:06:10,396 --> 02:06:13,438
I can't bend my fingers.
- Come on, do it slowly.

1504
02:06:13,605 --> 02:06:15,645
Pasha, do it slowly.

1505
02:06:20,854 --> 02:06:22,729
Come on, Pasha.

1506
02:06:22,896 --> 02:06:25,271
Come on!
- I can't.

1507
02:06:28,729 --> 02:06:29,812
216,

1508
02:06:29,979 --> 02:06:31,438
"return to base"

1509
02:06:31,812 --> 02:06:33,229
Copy. Going back.

1510
02:06:40,062 --> 02:06:43,229
This is 216. I see a flare!

1511
02:06:43,396 --> 02:06:44,812
"A signal flare!"

1512
02:06:44,979 --> 02:06:46,979
Call the rescue unit!

1513
02:06:47,146 --> 02:06:49,062
"We're copying the exact coordinates!"

1514
02:06:49,229 --> 02:06:53,604
"20 miles south-east of Bereznyaky..."

1515
02:07:36,645 --> 02:07:39,937
Thank you, Volodya.

1516
02:07:55,188 --> 02:07:59,104
Now I want to drink something.
A vodka, if you can.

1517
02:07:59,354 --> 02:08:01,271
Sure, Sergey Pavlovich.

Papa!

1523

Lyoshka!

1524
02:09:34,687 --> 02:09:37,437
What are you doing, kid?
Where did you go in the middle of the night?

1525
02:09:40,562 --> 02:09:43,188
She sleeps in the nest.
- Who?

1526
02:09:43,354 --> 02:09:44,979
The bird.

1527
02:09:45,562 --> 02:09:47,854
Good for you!

1528
02:09:48,396 --> 02:09:51,188
Were you scared?

1529
02:09:57,188 --> 02:09:59,979
Your heart is beating so fast.

1530
02:10:00,146 --> 02:10:03,687
Were you running around?
- No, papa. I did not run,

1531
02:10:03,854 --> 02:10:05,812
I flew.
