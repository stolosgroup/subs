00:00:44,246 --> 00:00:45,271
There's a big gap.

3
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,350
This feels like the
only route, let's keep going.

4
00:00:56,918 --> 00:00:58,422
You okay?

5
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:03,318
It's all right, kid.
Never be easy.

6
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:05,687
Okay.

7
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,350
- One...
- Be careful.

8
00:01:08,374 --> 00:01:09,974
...two, three!

9
00:01:11,318 --> 00:01:12,822
You okay?

10
00:01:12,854 --> 00:01:14,263
Okay.

11
00:01:16,022 --> 00:01:17,303
Oh, my God.

12
00:01:17,335 --> 00:01:18,335
Never better.

13
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,047
Okay.

14
00:01:27,926 --> 00:01:29,462
Whoa, whoa, you're good. Shit.

15
00:01:29,494 --> 00:01:30,614
You're good. Yeah?

16
00:01:31,286 --> 00:01:32,286
You're good?

17
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,102
No.

18
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,503
Okay, you've done
way scarier than this.

19
00:01:36,535 --> 00:01:38,902
Remember A.J. Hackett,
Snake Dike.

20
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:40,726
Stupid singing competition.

21
00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:42,071
God, you married this sad sack,

22
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:43,958
for Christ's sake.

23
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:45,718
Yeah? Okay.
Okay.

24
00:01:46,582 --> 00:01:48,950
One... Two...

25
00:01:49,847 --> 00:01:50,935
Three!

26
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:53,527
Come on! I got you.

27
00:01:53,558 --> 00:01:54,679
That's my girl.

28
00:01:57,078 --> 00:01:59,351
Ew! Gross!

29
00:01:59,383 --> 00:02:01,046
You guys, get a room!

30
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:04,375
Here comes Ethan Hunt.

31
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:06,646
Careful, H, there's loose
rock around the elbow.

32
00:02:06,678 --> 00:02:08,983
Worry about your ropes, bitches.

33
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:10,486
I'm fine.

34
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:12,470
Whoo!

35
00:02:12,502 --> 00:02:13,910
Try to keep up!

36
00:02:23,926 --> 00:02:26,902
Taking your time there, hotshot.

37
00:02:26,935 --> 00:02:29,750
Hunter, you show off!

38
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:30,838
Whoo!

39
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:07,639
Dan!

40
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,151
Dan!

41
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,942
Hold on, Dan.
Hold on, I'm coming.

42
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:16,183
Dan, are you okay?

43
00:03:16,214 --> 00:03:19,094
Just hold on.
I'm coming down.

44
00:03:19,127 --> 00:03:21,622
Come on. Come on.
I can't make it.

45
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:23,798
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, Becky, Becky.

46
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:25,087
I just need
a little more length.

47
00:03:25,111 --> 00:03:27,350
Can you
un-clip? Are you secure?

48
00:03:27,382 --> 00:03:28,759
Are you secure?
Yeah.

49
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,454
Yeah, I'm... I'm secure.

50
00:03:30,487 --> 00:03:32,350
Just un-clip and I'll be able
to swing to the rock.

51
00:03:32,374 --> 00:03:34,102
- Okay.
- I think I can reach it.

52
00:03:34,135 --> 00:03:35,158
Ready?

53
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,758
Can you reach it?

54
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,103
Just...
Just one second.

55
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:43,606
All right.
I think I can make it.

56
00:03:43,638 --> 00:03:45,079
Hold on, Dan.

57
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,486
I'm almost there.

58
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,551
Just need
a little more momentum.

59
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:48,662
Okay.

60
00:03:49,398 --> 00:03:50,870
No!

61
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,815
Dan!

62
00:04:17,846 --> 00:04:19,231
<i>Hey!</i>

63
00:04:19,255 --> 00:04:20,383
<i>Hey, this is Becky and Dan.</i>

64
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:21,302
<i>Leave a message.</i>

65
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:23,414
<i>Hey, Becky, it's me.</i>

66
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:27,062
<i>Look, I've tried to console you
every way I know how.</i>

67
00:04:27,094 --> 00:04:28,662
<i>But I...</i>

68
00:04:28,694 --> 00:04:31,894
<i>I can't help you
if you don't pick up the phone.</i>

69
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:34,486
<i>Sweetheart,
I'm worried about you.</i>

70
00:04:34,518 --> 00:04:36,406
<i>So whenever
you stop hating on me,</i>

71
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,678
<i>I am here.</i>

72
00:05:07,735 --> 00:05:09,095
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

73
00:05:11,318 --> 00:05:12,918
<i>This is just the voice mail.</i>

74
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,294
<i>You've reached Dan.</i>

75
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:16,094
<i>Just leave a message,
I'll hit you back when I can.</i>

76
00:05:16,118 --> 00:05:17,815
<i>Get it off at the beep.</i>

77
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,798
Hey.

78
00:05:21,686 --> 00:05:22,774
Miss you.

79
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:33,655
Dad, what?
Are you stalking me now?

80
00:05:33,686 --> 00:05:35,383
No, I just don't know
what else to do,

81
00:05:35,414 --> 00:05:37,046
'cause you're not
answering your phone.

82
00:05:37,078 --> 00:05:38,423
Take a hint.

83
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:39,774
I... I think this is getting
a little bit ridiculous.

84
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,239
"Ridiculous"?

85
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,831
You told me I shouldn't be
so broken up about him,

86
00:05:43,862 --> 00:05:45,847
because he was an asshole. No.

87
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,807
I said that maybe he didn't
belong on this pedestal

88
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:49,622
that you were putting him up on,

89
00:05:49,654 --> 00:05:51,839
that he wasn't this martyr that
you've been making him out to be.

90
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:53,591
This is how
you console your daughter?

91
00:05:53,623 --> 00:05:55,766
I just want you to be able
to move on with your life.

92
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:59,894
I don't want to move on.
I miss him!

93
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,102
Every day, I miss the way
he looked at me.

94
00:06:02,134 --> 00:06:03,326
I miss the way he made me feel.

95
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,350
Sweetie.
Don't!

96
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,718
Don't what?

97
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,319
What do you think
you're doing, Becky?

98
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:09,055
Getting away from you.
You are not driving. Stop it.

99
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,518
Fuck off!

100
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,055
You don't get to
talk to me like that.

101
00:06:12,086 --> 00:06:14,903
Your mother and I, we
raised you better than that.

102
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:16,694
So getting shit-faced

103
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:19,222
and pushing the people away
that love you,

104
00:06:19,831 --> 00:06:21,175
it's not gonna work.

105
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:22,231
All right, look,

106
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:24,886
a horrible thing
happened to you,

107
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:27,031
but you have to start
living your life again.

108
00:06:27,062 --> 00:06:28,694
All right?

109
00:06:28,726 --> 00:06:30,143
There's a whole big wide
world out there that needs you

110
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:31,831
and believe it or not,
I need you.

111
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:34,711
Let me give you a ride home.

112
00:06:36,694 --> 00:06:37,975
I'd rather walk.

113
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:42,583
Let me ask you something.

114
00:06:44,086 --> 00:06:45,302
If roles reversed,

115
00:06:45,334 --> 00:06:48,055
if it had been you
that had fallen that day,

116
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:50,038
do you think Dan
is standing out here alone?

117
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:52,855
Drowning in booze,
grief, sorrow,

118
00:06:52,886 --> 00:06:54,775
whatever the hell this is?

119
00:06:56,054 --> 00:06:57,943
He's not.

120
00:06:57,974 --> 00:06:59,575
And you damn well know it.

121
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,222
God damn it, Becky,
I need you to try.

122
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:07,574
Do you know what I need, Dad?

123
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:09,686
I need you to leave me alone.

124
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:19,103
God damn it.

125
00:07:27,703 --> 00:07:29,855
<i>The number
you have called has been disconnected.</i>

126
00:07:32,054 --> 00:07:33,238
No.

127
00:07:34,198 --> 00:07:35,383
No!

128
00:08:13,687 --> 00:08:15,863
Hi!
Hey.

129
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,518
You look, um...

130
00:08:18,551 --> 00:08:20,022
Awful.
Yeah.

131
00:08:20,054 --> 00:08:21,655
Yeah, like
really freakin' awful.

132
00:08:21,686 --> 00:08:23,062
Well, come here.

133
00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:29,782
So, what brings you back?

134
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:31,223
Are you finally ready to rest?

135
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,943
I'll rest when I'm dead.

136
00:08:35,126 --> 00:08:37,302
I have something that's planned.

137
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:38,743
And I need a partner in crime.

138
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:44,342
Look, your dad called me
a few weeks ago.

139
00:08:44,374 --> 00:08:46,038
He didn't know
who else to turn to.

140
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,022
And he said that
you were in a bad place.

141
00:08:48,055 --> 00:08:50,231
He had no right to do that.
He's worried about you.

142
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,415
It's coming up on a year.

143
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:53,654
He doesn't want you to be alone.

144
00:08:53,686 --> 00:08:55,606
Look, the only thing
that drives me crazier

145
00:08:55,638 --> 00:08:58,454
than Dan's boxed ashes
collecting dust in there,

146
00:08:58,486 --> 00:09:01,462
is my best friend
stuck in here with him.

147
00:09:01,495 --> 00:09:03,671
So I have something
that I wanna pitch you.

148
00:09:03,703 --> 00:09:04,759
You're not gonna like it,

149
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,551
but just try to keep
an open mind.

150
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,735
Look...

151
00:09:10,006 --> 00:09:12,950
The B-67 TV Tower.

152
00:09:12,982 --> 00:09:14,870
It's only a six-hour drive
from here.

153
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:16,822
I was planning on
climbing it this weekend

154
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:18,967
and I wanted to see
if you'd climb it with me.

155
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:23,542
It would be an adventure,

156
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:26,614
like old times.

157
00:09:26,647 --> 00:09:28,598
And you could scatter
Dan's ashes on top.

158
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,311
I just...
I haven't climbed since...

159
00:09:32,342 --> 00:09:33,342
I get it.

160
00:09:34,934 --> 00:09:36,287
But if you don't
confront your fears,

161
00:09:36,311 --> 00:09:37,846
you are always
going to be afraid.

162
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:40,630
What is it that Dan used to say?

163
00:09:41,846 --> 00:09:44,630
Don't die if you wanna live

164
00:09:44,662 --> 00:09:47,063
or keep living
even if you're dying.

165
00:09:47,095 --> 00:09:48,823
Shit, I feel like
I'm messing this pitch up.

166
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,614
No, I'm sorry.

167
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:52,150
Hunter, I just... I can't.

168
00:09:53,654 --> 00:09:56,278
It's like I know I
can't do it, I'm sorry.

169
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:58,006
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

170
00:09:58,038 --> 00:09:59,926
I can't.
Hey, hey, it's okay.

171
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,814
It's okay.

172
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:40,150
Morning, princess.

173
00:10:42,454 --> 00:10:44,630
What's wrong?

174
00:10:44,663 --> 00:10:46,934
"If you're scared of dying,
don't be afraid to live."

175
00:10:48,886 --> 00:10:50,390
That's what Dan used to say.

176
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:53,815
Let's do it.

177
00:10:53,846 --> 00:10:57,047
Let's climb your stupid tower.

178
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:59,030
Oh, my God, Becky,
baby, I'm so excited!

179
00:11:06,358 --> 00:11:08,567
I've never
actually seen this video.

180
00:11:10,262 --> 00:11:11,862
Shit, I was really ripped.

181
00:11:11,894 --> 00:11:14,102
Yeah! You're awesome.

182
00:11:14,134 --> 00:11:16,151
That is the Becky
that we need for this trip.

183
00:11:18,614 --> 00:11:19,831
Aw!

184
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:22,838
Holy shit!
Look at your beaming face.

185
00:11:22,871 --> 00:11:24,566
Now, who's this
in the photo with you?

186
00:11:24,598 --> 00:11:26,518
I don't know. It's an oldie.

187
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:28,631
Who is it?
Nobody.

188
00:11:28,663 --> 00:11:30,487
Just give it back.
Hunter has a boyfriend.

189
00:11:30,518 --> 00:11:32,567
It's nothing.
Just some guy.

190
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:35,191
Oh, that some guy sure knew
how to tickle your whistle.

191
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:48,959
<i>Yo, what's up, guys?</i>

192
00:11:48,983 --> 00:11:51,350
<i>Danger D,
and I'm back stateside, yo,</i>

193
00:11:51,382 --> 00:11:53,238
<i>hashtag, super badass.</i>

194
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,607
Okay, in my defense,

195
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,655
I may act like
a total dick on camera,

196
00:11:57,686 --> 00:11:58,686
but it's worth it.

197
00:11:58,711 --> 00:12:00,247
I get paid for this shit.

198
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:02,359
It's enough to keep me
traveling and you know me,

199
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,982
I have to be doing dangerous
shit to keep my blood pumping,

200
00:12:05,014 --> 00:12:06,902
so I might as well
monetize that.

201
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,622
I'm just saying if you're
gonna be a YouTuber,

202
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:11,510
why not be yourself?
You are awesome.

203
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:13,975
Natural born click-bait.
No.

204
00:12:14,006 --> 00:12:17,174
What we're doing here,
this is clickbait.

205
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:22,231
Excuse me?

206
00:12:22,262 --> 00:12:24,214
Do you have somewhere
I could charge my phone?

207
00:12:24,247 --> 00:12:25,942
Power ain't free, ma'am.

208
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:29,047
Oh, and do you know
where the B-67 TV Tower is?

209
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:30,198
We can't find it on the map.

210
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:33,558
You don't need a map.

211
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,967
You see that light way up there?

212
00:12:36,662 --> 00:12:38,390
That's your tower.

213
00:12:38,422 --> 00:12:40,375
That's insanely high.

214
00:12:42,518 --> 00:12:44,054
What's with the light?

215
00:12:44,086 --> 00:12:44,982
I thought you said
it was out of commission.

216
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,351
So aircraft can see it.

217
00:12:47,383 --> 00:12:49,782
You know, this was once
the tallest structure in the U.S.

218
00:12:51,223 --> 00:12:53,815
Now it's just this old relic.

219
00:12:53,846 --> 00:12:55,798
They're due to tear it down
next winter.

220
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,582
Becky?

221
00:12:58,615 --> 00:13:00,438
Becky?

222
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,390
What?
Give me your phone charger.

223
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:04,471
What are you doing?

224
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:08,471
A very cool life hack.

225
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:12,247
Now I'm just gonna
line up the prongs

226
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:14,263
with the elements in the lamp.

227
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,319
And...

228
00:13:17,911 --> 00:13:19,702
How's that for a dumb YouTuber?

229
00:13:38,838 --> 00:13:41,047
Hey, honey.

230
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:42,902
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you sleep well?

231
00:13:48,887 --> 00:13:50,006
I love you.

232
00:13:55,255 --> 00:13:57,014
You're not gonna say it back?

233
00:13:58,327 --> 00:13:59,327
I am saying it.

234
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,214
One...

235
00:14:02,327 --> 00:14:03,350
Four...

236
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:05,918
Three...

237
00:14:06,998 --> 00:14:08,119
I love you.

238
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,550
Hey, come
on, Becks. Sun's up.

239
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,607
What up, <i>El Capitan?</i>

240
00:14:39,638 --> 00:14:42,518
I don't know, but something's
up, <i>Sports Illustrated.</i>

241
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:43,551
Tits for clicks.

242
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:49,559
Are you live streaming?

243
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:51,734
No, dude.
Shoot now, post later.

244
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,111
Oh, good.
I don't wanna be in it.

245
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:57,239
<i>Hey, guys. Danger D here</i>

246
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,023

<i>The B-67 TV Tower.</i>

<i>This bad boy is
over 2,000 feet tall.</i>

252
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:17,303
<i>And your home girls</i>

253

<i>Watch out!</i>

256
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:33,623
Holy shit!

257
00:15:33,655 --> 00:15:34,679
Whoo!

258
00:15:34,711 --> 00:15:36,822
<i>Eight more lives, baby!</i>

259
00:16:11,798 --> 00:16:12,798
Shit.

260
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,966
Looks like
we're walking from here.

261
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:24,822
How far?
I don't know.

262
00:16:27,158 --> 00:16:29,111
Like a mile?

263
00:16:29,143 --> 00:16:30,326
Maybe two-ish?

264
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:36,727
Damn, it's hot.

265
00:16:36,758 --> 00:16:38,903
You'll cool down
once we get some air time.

266
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,630
We've got
enough water, you think?

267
00:16:41,654 --> 00:16:44,022
Water's check.
Harnesses check.

268
00:16:44,054 --> 00:16:46,454
<i>Super badass 4K drone check.</i>

269

<i>Selfie stick,
all the essentials.</i>

270
00:16:49,015 --> 00:16:50,327
Food?

271
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:51,391
Nah, we'll be back in time
before lunch...

272
00:16:51,415 --> 00:16:53,111
Oh, Jesus.

273
00:16:56,854 --> 00:16:57,974
<i>Holy shit, they're big.</i>

274
00:17:02,582 --> 00:17:04,375
It's still alive.

275
00:17:04,406 --> 00:17:05,494
Get off of him!

276
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:07,030
Hey! Hey!
Go away!

277
00:17:07,766 --> 00:17:09,302
Just go. Go!

278
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:17,366
Poor thing.

279
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:22,518
Pricks.

280
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,847
<i>Survival of the fittest, right?</i>

281
00:17:27,734 --> 00:17:29,687
You'd do the same

282
00:17:31,478 --> 00:17:33,719
"Feeling peckish."
Hunter.

283
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:35,191
What?

284
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,311
That's funny.

285
00:17:49,622 --> 00:17:51,542
Holy shit, 300 likes.

286
00:17:51,574 --> 00:17:52,855
Oh, wow.

287
00:17:54,326 --> 00:17:56,278
350.

288
00:17:56,311 --> 00:17:58,751
I wonder how many of
your followers are serial killers.

289
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:02,327
Holy shit.

290
00:18:03,895 --> 00:18:05,782
Looks a lot bigger
up close, right?

291
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:09,718
This is sick.

292
00:18:11,414 --> 00:18:12,791
This is awful.

293
00:18:13,847 --> 00:18:15,446
Hey, guys!

294
00:18:15,478 --> 00:18:17,335
Danger D here.

295
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:21,046
And we are at the foot of this
stomach-churningly massive

296
00:18:21,078 --> 00:18:23,447
fourth-highest structure
in the U.S.

297
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:25,782
<i>We're gonna begin
our grueling journey</i>

298
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:28,151
<i>with an 1,800-foot ladder climb</i>

299
00:18:28,183 --> 00:18:30,646
inside a steel cage.

300
00:18:30,678 --> 00:18:31,862
And then after the cage...

301
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:35,990
...we have a 200-foot,
vertigo-inspiring mast

302
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:37,654
with an external ladder.

303
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:40,534
Your girl's gonna be wide open
to the elements.

304
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:43,447
And then beyond that,
we have the precipice.

305
00:18:43,478 --> 00:18:46,454
<i>The ledge.
The top of the world, Ma.</i>

306
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:47,487
<i>Hunter?</i>

307
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:53,815
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

308
00:18:53,846 --> 00:18:55,255
Babe, of course you can.

309
00:18:55,286 --> 00:18:57,047
No, um, I really can't.
I'm, like...

310
00:18:58,135 --> 00:18:59,798
I'm petrified.
I'm, like, shaking.

311
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:01,847
I'm here.

312
00:19:03,318 --> 00:19:04,438
Take a breath.

313
00:19:06,806 --> 00:19:09,367
After Dan died, I was
afraid of my own shadow.

314
00:19:10,294 --> 00:19:12,311
But I pushed through.

315
00:19:12,343 --> 00:19:14,902
I overcame the fear.
I took control.

316
00:19:16,183 --> 00:19:18,871
Do not let this fear
consume you.

317
00:19:18,902 --> 00:19:21,847
Come at it head on
and kick its ass.

318
00:19:21,878 --> 00:19:24,950
If you can beat it,
you can beat anything.

319
00:19:24,983 --> 00:19:28,246
And I'm right here
beside you the whole time.

320
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:32,311
You are so much stronger
than you think you are.

321
00:19:33,398 --> 00:19:35,062
So shut your shit.

322
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:36,278
And let's do this.

323
00:19:38,486 --> 00:19:40,087
God, Hunter.

324
00:19:40,118 --> 00:19:41,782
You know,
that's the kind of shit

325
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:43,286
you should be posting
on Instagram.

326
00:19:44,246 --> 00:19:45,246
Come on.

327
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,671
Dude, this is so cool.

328
00:19:51,703 --> 00:19:53,174
Holy shit.

329
00:19:55,255 --> 00:19:56,982
Look at this.

330
00:19:57,014 --> 00:19:59,862
Damn it, Hunter.
You are such an asshole.

331
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:02,327
What are you getting us into?

332
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:03,479
Don't worry.

333
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:05,718
We've got 50 feet of rope
between us.

334
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,606
We're clipped in
and we're all good.

335
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,974
Okay.

336
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:11,414
One rung at a time,

337
00:20:11,446 --> 00:20:12,846
and let me know
if you have to rest.

338
00:20:43,094 --> 00:20:44,407
Okay, okay.

339
00:20:53,143 --> 00:20:54,582
See?

340
00:20:54,614 --> 00:20:55,702
It's easy.

341
00:20:59,414 --> 00:21:00,502
Sure.

342
00:21:02,422 --> 00:21:03,959
You're doing great.
Come on.

343
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:48,023
You okay?

344
00:21:49,718 --> 00:21:50,743
No.

345
00:21:52,342 --> 00:21:53,398
You're doing great.

346
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:54,846
Come on.

347
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:31,967
Hunter?

348
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:36,055
Hunter?
Yeah?

349
00:22:36,086 --> 00:22:37,943
Can we rest a moment?

350
00:22:37,975 --> 00:22:39,350
I need a drink.

351
00:22:39,382 --> 00:22:40,382
Of course.

352
00:22:42,743 --> 00:22:44,534
Those guy lines means
we're halfway up.

353
00:22:48,631 --> 00:22:49,782
Perfect spot.

354
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,918
Wanna know something crazy?

355
00:22:54,103 --> 00:22:55,094
What?

356
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:56,758
Halfway up.

357
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:59,575
That means we've
climbed about 1,000 feet.

358
00:22:59,606 --> 00:23:01,718
So we've climbed the height
of the Eiffel Tower.

359
00:23:03,286 --> 00:23:04,846
Please don't say
shit like that, Hunter.

360
00:23:05,911 --> 00:23:07,414
Whoa!

361
00:23:07,447 --> 00:23:10,231
There's the motel.
And the diner.

362
00:23:10,262 --> 00:23:13,367
No way. Looks like
a little toy town.

363
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:19,606
Let's just get this over with.

364
00:23:19,638 --> 00:23:20,638
Yeah.

365
00:23:24,151 --> 00:23:25,430
Come on.

366
00:23:25,462 --> 00:23:26,462
Catch up.

367
00:23:44,951 --> 00:23:46,742
That's it.

368
00:23:46,774 --> 00:23:48,535
Becky, you're doing amazing.

369
00:23:51,926 --> 00:23:53,302
Come on!

370
00:23:53,335 --> 00:23:54,518
Come on, Becky!

371
00:24:10,807 --> 00:24:12,662
Okay.

372
00:24:12,694 --> 00:24:14,966
This is the end
of the internal ladder.

373
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:17,238
One step at a time, okay.
You got this.

374
00:24:18,871 --> 00:24:22,038
The next 200 feet is external.

375
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,222
I'm not gonna lie.

376
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:24,511
It's gonna get
a little bit crazy

377
00:24:24,535 --> 00:24:26,102
when we're out of the cage
in the open.

378
00:24:26,134 --> 00:24:27,191
But don't panic.

379
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:40,278
Hunter.

380
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,558
Hunter!

381
00:24:41,591 --> 00:24:43,126
Hunter! Hunter!

382
00:24:43,158 --> 00:24:45,527
Becky! You gotta come up.
It's so sick!

383
00:24:47,287 --> 00:24:48,343
Okay.

384
00:25:01,046 --> 00:25:02,326
Hunter?

385
00:25:02,358 --> 00:25:03,671
I'm here.

386
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:05,462
It's just like 200 feet more,
that's all.

387
00:25:05,494 --> 00:25:07,094
I can't!

388
00:25:07,126 --> 00:25:08,534
Yes, you can!

389
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:12,214
Just look up and only up.

390
00:25:16,886 --> 00:25:19,286
You're doing great.
You got this.

391
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,454
Okay.

392
00:25:23,894 --> 00:25:24,894
Okay.

393
00:25:35,894 --> 00:25:36,894
Okay.

394
00:25:57,398 --> 00:25:59,222
Yeah! You're killing it!

395
00:25:59,254 --> 00:26:00,254
Whoo!

396
00:26:04,151 --> 00:26:05,151
You're okay.

397
00:26:06,614 --> 00:26:08,183
Remember, only look up.

398
00:26:14,422 --> 00:26:15,767
What the hell are we doing?

399
00:26:16,438 --> 00:26:17,750
Hey!

400
00:26:17,783 --> 00:26:19,414
Stop over thinking.

401
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:21,175
- How?
- I don't know.

402
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:23,575
Concentrate on
something else, like...

403
00:26:23,606 --> 00:26:27,254
Sing a, a nursery rhyme
or some shit.

404
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,702
Okay, okay.

405
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,878
Okay.

406
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,118
Down!

407
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:46,615
I wouldn't have picked that one.

408
00:26:48,214 --> 00:26:49,846
Wow.

409
00:26:49,878 --> 00:26:51,446
Okay. Okay, Becks,

410
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:54,710
this is gonna look a
little bit worse than it is.

411
00:26:54,742 --> 00:26:57,526
Ah, what the hell, Hunter?
Let's just go back down!

412
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:05,270
Becky, if I let you go back now,

413
00:27:05,302 --> 00:27:06,551
fear wins.

414
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,142
And I'm not going
to let that happen.

415
00:27:42,775 --> 00:27:43,927
It's okay, Becks.

416
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:46,903
It's okay.

417
00:27:46,934 --> 00:27:48,342
I've got your weight.

418
00:27:50,422 --> 00:27:52,310
Thanks. Okay.

419
00:28:09,143 --> 00:28:10,486
Reach up.

420
00:28:10,518 --> 00:28:11,551
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

421
00:28:19,382 --> 00:28:20,567
Okay.

422
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:23,158
Smooth as sailing
to the top now.

423
00:28:23,191 --> 00:28:24,214
You got this.

424
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:28,855
I actually really
do hate you, Hunter.

425
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:32,054
Hey, does this ladder
feel loose to you?

426
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:37,430
Stop, you dick, Hunter!

427
00:28:37,462 --> 00:28:39,286
Sorry.

428
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:48,118
What was that?

429
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:50,423
Come on, we're almost there.

430
00:28:54,071 --> 00:28:55,798
Come on.
Okay.

431
00:29:24,631 --> 00:29:25,631
Wow.

432
00:29:29,846 --> 00:29:31,262
Becky, you're not gonna
believe this.

433
00:29:31,286 --> 00:29:32,646
You gotta come up here.
I'm coming.

434
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:36,086
- Okay.
- Whoo!

435
00:29:37,046 --> 00:29:38,071
Okay.

436
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,710
Hunter.

437
00:29:51,031 --> 00:29:52,694
Hey, trust me.

438
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:56,022
Okay, okay.

439
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:07,894
Fuck, Becky!

440
00:30:07,927 --> 00:30:09,718
Oh, I'm here.
Oh, my God.

441
00:30:18,422 --> 00:30:20,118
Oh, my God.

442
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,463
We did it, Becks!

443
00:30:21,494 --> 00:30:22,550
I knew you could.

444
00:30:23,414 --> 00:30:24,886
Whoo!

445
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,710
Whoo!

446
00:30:45,206 --> 00:30:46,934
Here we go!

447
00:30:50,423 --> 00:30:52,375
On top of the goddamn world!

448
00:30:52,406 --> 00:30:53,846
Whoo!

449
00:30:57,014 --> 00:30:58,518
Do you wanna try?

450
00:31:00,631 --> 00:31:01,847
Shit! Hunter, stop!

451
00:31:01,879 --> 00:31:03,607
Just focus on
getting a good shot.

452
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:05,431
I didn't wear this
stupid bra for nothing.

453
00:31:05,462 --> 00:31:06,551
No.

454
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:07,703
No, Hunter.
Whoo!

455
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,126
Swoop it around!

456
00:31:13,526 --> 00:31:15,031
Seize your day!

457
00:31:15,062 --> 00:31:17,174
Okay. Oh, my God.

458
00:31:28,727 --> 00:31:30,134
How'd it look?

459
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:32,438
Insane! Insane. Crazy.

460
00:31:33,974 --> 00:31:36,535
Let's get this bad boy back.

461
00:31:36,566 --> 00:31:40,151
Holy shit, so sick, dude.

462
00:31:40,183 --> 00:31:42,806
Okay. Now the ultimate, Becks.

463
00:31:42,838 --> 00:31:44,054
Your turn.

464
00:31:48,887 --> 00:31:50,711
What? No.

465
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:52,598
Do you want to kick fear
in the dick or not?

466
00:31:52,631 --> 00:31:56,086
No. No, Hunter.

467
00:31:56,118 --> 00:31:57,974
The old Becky
would have done it.

468
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,526
Just saying...
Dude.

469
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:03,958
Here. I'll hold your hand.

470
00:32:09,686 --> 00:32:11,126
Okay.
Yeah?

471
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:12,438
Okay.

472
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,711
Shit.

473
00:32:14,743 --> 00:32:16,375
Come on, come on!

474
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:19,126
You can do this.

475
00:32:21,751 --> 00:32:23,062
You can do it.

476
00:32:23,095 --> 00:32:26,231
Okay, okay, okay.

477
00:32:26,263 --> 00:32:29,111
- I got you.
- Okay.

478
00:32:29,143 --> 00:32:30,646
Okay. Whoa!

479
00:32:30,678 --> 00:32:32,159
- You can trust me.
- Whoa, okay.

480
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:33,919
- I've got you, Becks.
- Oh, my God.

481
00:32:35,126 --> 00:32:36,342
Careful over the ledge.

482
00:32:37,462 --> 00:32:39,222
Take it easy.

483
00:32:39,254 --> 00:32:41,719
Okay, I've got you.
I've got you.

484
00:32:47,926 --> 00:32:49,207
Open your eyes.

485
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,782
Whoo-hoo!

486
00:32:59,446 --> 00:33:01,687
Okay, just one more.

487
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,215
You're coming up right now.

488
00:33:11,894 --> 00:33:13,174
My God, you did it.

489
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:15,991
You did it!
You did it, you idiot.

490
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,887
Yes! Look.

491
00:33:20,918 --> 00:33:23,030
Look how amazing these are.
Oh, my God.

492
00:33:23,063 --> 00:33:24,887
Whoa!

493
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:31,351
Next time you are
ever afraid of anything,

494
00:33:31,382 --> 00:33:33,078
I want you to look at these

495
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,998
and know that you have
nothing to be afraid of.

496
00:33:36,535 --> 00:33:39,127
Thank you.
Yeah.

497
00:33:39,158 --> 00:33:40,630
I'm really proud of you.

498
00:33:41,782 --> 00:33:43,094
Dan would be, too.

499
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,030
Yeah.

500
00:33:55,735 --> 00:33:57,110
Okay.

501
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,447
Okay, it's time.

502
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:36,727
You and I were one, Dan.

503
00:34:38,422 --> 00:34:40,214
And whenever I needed a laugh,

504
00:34:41,494 --> 00:34:44,022
you told me
one of your shit jokes.

505
00:34:48,982 --> 00:34:50,806
And whenever I needed
a shoulder to cry on,

506
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:51,895
it was yours.

507
00:34:55,031 --> 00:34:57,047
And now you're gone and I'm...

508
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,390
I don't feel whole anymore.

509
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:11,126
I miss you, um,
just so much and I'm...

510
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,294
I love you.

511
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,014
Goodbye, Dan.

512
00:35:33,527 --> 00:35:34,998
Hey.
I'm sorry.

513
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:38,806
I just didn't expect it
to hit me like that.

514
00:35:39,766 --> 00:35:41,239
Yeah.

515
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,223
I've just been
so far away for so long.

516
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,838
It just didn't really
feel real until then.

517
00:35:51,767 --> 00:35:53,206
Come on.

518
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:58,166
Let's get back down
on earth, okay?

519
00:35:58,198 --> 00:35:59,998
I don't know about you,
but I really need to pee.

520
00:36:00,022 --> 00:36:02,062
I've needed to pee since
we passed the Eiffel Tower.

521
00:36:03,254 --> 00:36:04,918
Okay?

522
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:06,934
Okay, home time.

523
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:08,279
Home time.

524
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:10,518
Harnesses?
Harnesses.

525
00:36:14,743 --> 00:36:17,366
Think of the
ice-cold beers waiting for us.

526
00:36:17,398 --> 00:36:18,614
Oh, stop.

527
00:36:20,534 --> 00:36:23,383
I've got you.
Okay, slowly.

528
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:24,599
Okay.

529
00:36:24,631 --> 00:36:26,359
Uh, I'm just getting
a stitch here.

530
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,022
Okay, okay.

531
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:46,271
Okay.

532
00:37:02,422 --> 00:37:03,422
Hunter!

533
00:37:12,918 --> 00:37:14,359
No!

534
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:26,455
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, holy shit.

535
00:37:28,534 --> 00:37:31,222
Don't let go.
Yeah, I got you.

536
00:37:31,255 --> 00:37:32,255
Hunter!

537
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:41,990
Oh, God, please don't drop me.

538
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,638
Don't drop me.

539
00:37:59,383 --> 00:38:00,383
Becks?

540
00:38:05,815 --> 00:38:07,031
I've got you, Becks.

541
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:11,478
I can see the ladder.

542
00:38:25,526 --> 00:38:27,127
I've got you.

543
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,598
I just died almost.

544
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:38,455
Oh, my God.

545
00:38:38,486 --> 00:38:40,727
Did that really just happen?

546
00:38:40,759 --> 00:38:43,062
Oh, my...
Jesus Christ!

547
00:38:43,094 --> 00:38:44,215
I wish we'd filmed that.

548
00:38:46,006 --> 00:38:47,575
Oh, you're here.

549
00:38:47,606 --> 00:38:49,854
Let's get back on the ground
before I actually pee myself.

550
00:38:49,878 --> 00:38:51,031
Yeah.

551
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,062
Okay, take two.

552
00:39:01,366 --> 00:39:02,551
Oh, no.

553
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:04,542
The ladder.

554
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:06,326
It's gone.

555
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:25,366
Hunter, how do we get down?

556
00:39:25,398 --> 00:39:26,486
Shit!

557
00:39:26,518 --> 00:39:27,614
Please tell me there's
a way to go down.

558
00:39:27,638 --> 00:39:29,879
There's nothing on the pole
I can get a good foothold on.

559
00:39:29,911 --> 00:39:31,670
No.
Oh, no.

560
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,302
No, no, no.

561
00:39:33,334 --> 00:39:35,447
Um, there must be something.

562
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,774
No. Shit.

563
00:39:38,806 --> 00:39:40,279
I don't have a signal.

564
00:39:42,871 --> 00:39:43,871
I don't get it, either.

565
00:39:44,951 --> 00:39:46,550
I'm sure there's something,

566
00:39:46,582 --> 00:39:47,966
I'm sure it's just
really spotty up here.

567
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,598
No, we're too freaking high.
There's no signal up here.

568
00:39:49,622 --> 00:39:50,999
We're gonna be okay.

569
00:39:51,031 --> 00:39:52,382
Freaking out is not gonna
help anything right now.

570
00:39:52,406 --> 00:39:53,623
So just take a breath.

571
00:39:53,654 --> 00:39:55,158
We're stuck on
a pizza-sized platform

572
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,599
in the middle of nowhere,
Hunter.

573
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:59,062
Becky, freaking out
is not gonna help anything.

574
00:39:59,095 --> 00:40:00,470
It's not gonna help, okay.

575
00:40:01,142 --> 00:40:02,142
It's okay.

576
00:40:03,798 --> 00:40:06,359
I'm sure we can... Wait,
Hunter. Hunter, Hunter.

577
00:40:06,391 --> 00:40:07,670
Look at this.

578
00:40:07,702 --> 00:40:09,494
Oh, my God.

579
00:40:09,526 --> 00:40:11,478
Binoculars. Amazing.
Okay.

580
00:40:12,374 --> 00:40:13,558
We have a flare.

581
00:40:13,591 --> 00:40:14,591
Okay.

582
00:40:16,406 --> 00:40:17,462
Okay.

583
00:40:17,494 --> 00:40:18,551
This is great news.
Okay.

584
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,270
Oh, shit, our bag is down there.

585
00:40:30,934 --> 00:40:32,951
Oh, man, our water's in there.

586
00:40:34,903 --> 00:40:35,935
Shit, we're gonna die of thirst.

587
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:37,687
No. No.
We don't have water.

588
00:40:37,718 --> 00:40:39,222
No, think about it...
The noise!

589
00:40:39,254 --> 00:40:40,510
That is how you die
when you're stranded.

590
00:40:40,534 --> 00:40:42,142
The noise that this thing made
when it crashed,

591
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:44,630
there is no way
nobody heard that.

592
00:40:44,663 --> 00:40:46,902
Okay? I'm...
I'm sure that there

593
00:40:46,934 --> 00:40:50,038
are like multiple calls to 911
as we speak.

594
00:40:50,071 --> 00:40:51,287
Do you really think so?

595
00:40:52,054 --> 00:40:53,239
Yeah.

596
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,302
Yeah, the cavalry
is coming, okay?

597
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:56,662
We just...
We just have to wait.

598
00:40:56,695 --> 00:40:58,550
Okay. Okay.

599
00:41:00,694 --> 00:41:01,943
Holy...

600
00:41:01,975 --> 00:41:03,478
What? What?
Becky, your leg.

601
00:41:03,511 --> 00:41:05,142
My God.

602
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,735
What the hell?

603
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:09,367
I didn't even notice this.

604
00:41:10,006 --> 00:41:11,479
Whoa!

605
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,198
Um, whoa! Come
here. Let's compress it.

606
00:41:14,231 --> 00:41:15,871
Are you okay? I know.
Ow! It really hurts.

607
00:41:15,895 --> 00:41:17,183
Can you just like...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

608
00:41:17,207 --> 00:41:18,775
Can you warn me?
Okay.

609
00:41:18,806 --> 00:41:20,534
Count of three?
Yeah. One...

610
00:41:20,566 --> 00:41:23,414
Two... Sorry.
I'm really sorry.

611
00:41:23,446 --> 00:41:24,662
I know.
Oh, man.

612
00:41:24,694 --> 00:41:26,551
Are you okay?

613
00:41:26,582 --> 00:41:28,694
Yeah, I know I'm like,
I'm okay. It's like...

614
00:41:32,759 --> 00:41:35,383
I really have to pee.

615
00:41:35,414 --> 00:41:37,111
- Just go.
- No.

616
00:41:37,142 --> 00:41:39,254
Just pee.
No, it's fine. I can hold it.

617
00:41:39,287 --> 00:41:40,822
I just need to get comfortable.

618
00:41:49,814 --> 00:41:50,911
Can you go any farther?

619
00:41:50,935 --> 00:41:52,919
It's, like, spraying.

620
00:41:52,951 --> 00:41:54,839
Okay, careful over
the ledge. I'm trying.

621
00:41:54,871 --> 00:41:56,759
Stop looking at me.

622
00:41:56,791 --> 00:41:59,575
Oh, God. That's a relief.

623
00:41:59,606 --> 00:42:03,254
I'm just grateful
you didn't need to shit.

624
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,335
Okay, well, we should find
a way to get comfortable,

625
00:42:05,366 --> 00:42:07,326
'cause I think we're gonna
be up here for a while.

626
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:10,079
All right.

627
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:16,310
All right!

628
00:42:22,262 --> 00:42:23,958
Do you really think
someone's coming?

629
00:42:25,463 --> 00:42:27,223
One million percent.

630
00:43:05,687 --> 00:43:09,431
<i>Hey, Danger D,

00:44:19,382 --> 00:44:21,527
What happened...

660
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:23,894
It just made me realize
that life is fleeting.

661
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:30,167
And I want to spread that
message, that life is short,

662
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:31,286
too short.

663
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:34,582
So, you gotta use every moment.

664
00:44:34,615 --> 00:44:37,814
You have to do something
that makes you feel alive.

665
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:49,430
That was amazing.

666
00:44:51,191 --> 00:44:53,878
Wow, I mean, I told you,
you should just be yourself.

667
00:44:55,351 --> 00:44:56,534
That was really great.

668
00:44:59,927 --> 00:45:01,687
Should I kill Danger D?

669
00:45:01,718 --> 00:45:02,870
Mm-hmm.

670
00:45:02,903 --> 00:45:04,534
I'll help you bury the body.

671
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:22,774
Oh, shit.

672
00:45:22,807 --> 00:45:24,470
There's like
an old RV thing down there.

673
00:45:24,502 --> 00:45:25,687
Can I see?

674
00:45:25,718 --> 00:45:27,478
Just past the gate,
a little over.

675
00:45:29,687 --> 00:45:30,687
Yeah.

676
00:45:31,574 --> 00:45:32,599
That looks abandoned.

677
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:36,086
It's been five hours.

678
00:45:36,118 --> 00:45:37,846
If anyone called 911,
they'd be here by now.

679
00:45:54,487 --> 00:45:55,487
Oh, my God.

680
00:45:56,278 --> 00:45:57,590
Holy shit.

681
00:45:57,623 --> 00:46:00,599
Hold on, Becky,
we don't get service up here,

682
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:02,102
but we definitely
did down there.

683
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,446
Remember, I got all those likes?

684
00:46:03,479 --> 00:46:04,758
Shit.

685
00:46:05,431 --> 00:46:07,223
Okay.

686
00:46:07,255 --> 00:46:08,702
Okay, so we don't know at
what point we lost service.

687
00:46:08,726 --> 00:46:10,103
Maybe it was just up here

688
00:46:10,135 --> 00:46:11,710
because of some
like interference with the...

689
00:46:11,734 --> 00:46:13,046
The broadcast antenna.
Yeah.

690
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:14,783
I think you're definitely
onto something, Hunter.

691
00:46:14,807 --> 00:46:16,502
Okay, we have 50 feet of rope.

692
00:46:16,534 --> 00:46:18,230
We can try to fish for coverage.

693
00:46:18,262 --> 00:46:20,407
I just need something
to secure this with.

694
00:46:20,438 --> 00:46:22,519
My hair tie.
Yeah, perfect.

695
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:23,550
Okay.

696
00:46:24,503 --> 00:46:25,910
Okay.

697
00:46:25,942 --> 00:46:27,230
Can you message
emergency services?

698
00:46:27,254 --> 00:46:28,406
I don't think so.

699
00:46:28,439 --> 00:46:29,750
But I have
over 60,000 followers.

700
00:46:29,782 --> 00:46:30,998
Okay.

701
00:46:31,031 --> 00:46:37,879
"Help us. Stuck on
B-67 Tower. Call 911."

702
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:39,262
It's ready to post.

703
00:46:39,286 --> 00:46:40,727
We should hear it when it sends.

704
00:46:46,934 --> 00:46:48,374
Come on, come on.

705
00:46:48,918 --> 00:46:50,038
Okay.

706
00:46:50,966 --> 00:46:51,966
Okay.

707
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:57,558
Let's see if I can get lower.

708
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:02,039
Just be careful.

709
00:47:02,071 --> 00:47:04,342
Got it, okay. Come on.

710
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:11,030
That's the end.

711
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:13,111
I didn't hear anything.
I didn't, either.

712
00:47:13,142 --> 00:47:14,455
I don't think it posted.

713
00:47:17,399 --> 00:47:19,190
Okay, maybe I can get lower.

714
00:47:20,662 --> 00:47:22,007
What? What do you mean?
Just...

715
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:23,199
I've got it.
I've got an idea.

716
00:47:30,518 --> 00:47:32,726
Careful, Hunter.
Feels solid.

717
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:36,607
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

718
00:47:42,134 --> 00:47:43,766
Okay.

719
00:47:43,798 --> 00:47:45,590
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.

720
00:47:45,622 --> 00:47:46,615
- Careful.
- Shit.

721
00:47:46,646 --> 00:47:48,023
Oh, my God, Hunter.

722
00:47:48,055 --> 00:47:49,879
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

723
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,007
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

724
00:47:53,815 --> 00:47:55,478
Careful. Shit.

725
00:48:03,766 --> 00:48:04,958
I don't hear anything.
Nothing.

726
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:06,263
Okay, you need to come back up.

727
00:48:09,911 --> 00:48:10,999
Shit.

728
00:48:18,391 --> 00:48:19,391
I got it.

729
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:30,871
Did it post?

730
00:48:32,054 --> 00:48:33,054
No.

731
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:36,470
What do we do now?
I don't know.

732
00:48:39,607 --> 00:48:41,462
Wait, hold on.

733
00:48:41,494 --> 00:48:43,511
We know there's a signal
at the base for sure.

734
00:48:43,543 --> 00:48:44,534
Yeah.

735
00:48:44,567 --> 00:48:46,519
What if we just drop the phone?

736
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:48,127
Okay, but what if my phone
just shatters into a million pieces?

737
00:48:48,151 --> 00:48:49,495
Not if we reinforce it somehow,

738
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:51,103
so it doesn't like
the egg drop challenge.

739
00:48:51,127 --> 00:48:52,886
Yeah. Okay, shit.

740
00:48:52,918 --> 00:48:55,798
Um, we just need
something to... To put it in.

741
00:48:55,831 --> 00:48:57,494
Yeah.
This.

742
00:48:58,231 --> 00:48:59,798
It's welded on.

743
00:48:59,831 --> 00:49:01,526
My shoe's too flimsy.

744
00:49:01,558 --> 00:49:04,310
Your shoe?
Yeah, perfect.

745
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:05,750
Okay, got it.

746
00:49:08,663 --> 00:49:10,998
We need some padding.
Can we use your sock?

747
00:49:12,535 --> 00:49:14,294
Yeah. Okay.

748
00:49:15,287 --> 00:49:16,790
Okay.

749
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:21,558
We still need something
more substantial.

750
00:49:22,518 --> 00:49:24,055
Oh, Hunter.

751
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,654
Your push-up bra.

752
00:49:25,687 --> 00:49:27,830
That is more substantial.
Yeah.

753
00:49:27,863 --> 00:49:29,750
Dying to get
this thing off, anyway.

754
00:49:31,351 --> 00:49:33,014
Thank you, VS.

755
00:49:35,062 --> 00:49:36,470
Okay.

756
00:49:36,503 --> 00:49:38,102
Hope it's strong enough.

757
00:49:38,134 --> 00:49:39,895
Shove it real good.

758
00:49:43,127 --> 00:49:44,127
Okay.

759
00:49:46,774 --> 00:49:47,798
Here goes nothing.

760
00:50:02,294 --> 00:50:03,702
Did it work?

761
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,094
I don't know.
I can't tell.

762
00:50:19,222 --> 00:50:20,630
Do you see anything?

763
00:50:20,663 --> 00:50:22,294
No, nothing.

764
00:50:23,351 --> 00:50:24,374
Don't worry.

765
00:50:25,303 --> 00:50:26,359
They're coming.

766
00:50:32,822 --> 00:50:35,990
Holy shit!
There's a freaking guy!

767
00:50:36,023 --> 00:50:38,390
- What?
- Oh, my God. Yes.

768
00:50:38,422 --> 00:50:39,574
And a dog, too.

769
00:50:41,174 --> 00:50:43,478
Hey! Up here!
Hey, help us!

770
00:50:46,423 --> 00:50:49,111
Look, I sent you the
check, man. Come on.

771
00:50:49,142 --> 00:50:51,415
I need that...

772
00:50:51,446 --> 00:50:53,270
- Hey!
- Hey, boy! Big boy!

773
00:50:58,582 --> 00:50:59,582
Parker.

774
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:02,711
Come! Come on, boy.

775
00:51:02,743 --> 00:51:03,926
No, no, no, no, no.

776
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,270
Shit!

777
00:51:07,511 --> 00:51:08,630
Hey!

778
00:51:11,062 --> 00:51:12,182
Let's go.

779
00:51:14,486 --> 00:51:16,094
God damn it,
they're getting away.

780
00:51:30,166 --> 00:51:31,447
Parker.

781
00:51:33,175 --> 00:51:34,391
He got the shoe.

782
00:51:34,423 --> 00:51:36,086
Hey! Up here!
Look up here. Please!

783
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,166
Hey!
Hey!

784
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:47,575
He's walking!
Hey!

785
00:51:54,326 --> 00:51:56,022
No, no, no, turn around!
Turn around!

786
00:51:56,054 --> 00:51:57,175
Right here!

787
00:51:57,206 --> 00:51:58,206
Hey!

788
00:51:59,479 --> 00:52:01,526
Shit! Shit!
Hey!

789
00:52:04,279 --> 00:52:05,782
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no.

790
00:52:05,815 --> 00:52:07,542
Do not fire the flare,
he's not looking.

791
00:52:07,574 --> 00:52:08,767
This might be our only chance.

792
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:10,742
No, no, no, he's not looking.

793
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:13,687
Wait.

794
00:52:13,718 --> 00:52:15,511
Hold on.
There's somebody by the RV.

795
00:52:15,542 --> 00:52:17,431
He's setting up
a grill or some shit.

796
00:52:17,462 --> 00:52:18,710
Okay.

797
00:52:18,743 --> 00:52:20,350
And we'll fire the flare
when the sun goes down

798
00:52:20,374 --> 00:52:22,135
in like...
In like an hour.

799
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:23,446
We've only got one shot at this.

800
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,359
Oh, damn.

801
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:27,415
What?

802
00:52:27,446 --> 00:52:29,974
They're making ribs.
Oh, no.

803
00:52:30,007 --> 00:52:31,574
And they have really cold beer.

804
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:32,662
Don't.

805
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:50,102
These guys
are definitely a couple.

806
00:52:51,062 --> 00:52:53,654
Dirty weekend away.

807
00:52:53,686 --> 00:52:54,775
I'm jealous.

808
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:14,167
Hey, hey, hey.
They're finishing up.

809
00:53:14,198 --> 00:53:15,455
It's now or never,
fire the flare.

810
00:53:15,479 --> 00:53:17,686
Is it dark enough?
Uh-huh.

811
00:53:17,718 --> 00:53:19,862
Okay.

812
00:53:19,894 --> 00:53:21,079
Shit.
Shit. What the hell?

813
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:22,838
Why isn't it firing?
I fired it.

814
00:53:22,871 --> 00:53:24,607
I cocked it, maybe there's
a safety or something?

815
00:53:24,631 --> 00:53:26,366
Shit. Okay, they're
going in, they're going in.

816
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:27,518
You have to do the flare now.
- I'm trying.

817
00:53:27,542 --> 00:53:28,607
Get it to go.
It's stuck.

818
00:53:28,631 --> 00:53:30,134
Okay, I got it. I got it.

819
00:53:35,414 --> 00:53:37,910
Hey, Randy,
come check this shit out.

820
00:53:37,942 --> 00:53:40,022
Okay, give me your phone.
Okay.

821
00:53:41,911 --> 00:53:43,862
Hey, sons of bitches, up here!

822
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:46,807
Holy shit! Check this out.

823
00:53:47,959 --> 00:53:49,398
Up here! Hey!

824
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:50,494
Wait, wait, wait,
they're looking at us.

825
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:51,511
What?
They can see us.

826
00:53:51,542 --> 00:53:52,631
Oh, my God!

827
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:53,879
Holy shit! Oh, my God,

828
00:53:53,911 --> 00:53:56,311
let me see, let me see,
let me see.

829
00:53:56,342 --> 00:53:57,942
Oh, my God, they're coming.

830
00:53:59,095 --> 00:54:00,095
Hey!

831
00:54:03,766 --> 00:54:05,054
Holy shit, they found the car.

832
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:06,710
They found our car,
they found our car.

833
00:54:09,047 --> 00:54:10,742
They have a... A crowbar.

834
00:54:10,774 --> 00:54:12,214
They're probably
gonna open the gate.

835
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:14,647
- Okay.
- Okay.

836
00:54:14,678 --> 00:54:15,743
Wait, what the hell?

837
00:54:15,767 --> 00:54:17,206
Wait, what's going on?

838
00:54:17,238 --> 00:54:19,126
They stopped.
What?

839
00:54:19,158 --> 00:54:21,334
Quit chatting,
go open the freakin' gate.

840
00:54:21,367 --> 00:54:24,086
No. No, no, no.
What the hell?

841
00:54:24,118 --> 00:54:25,183
They're stealing
my freakin' car!

842
00:54:25,207 --> 00:54:26,231
What?

843
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,310
No, you sons of bitches!
Hey!

844
00:54:28,343 --> 00:54:30,326
You asshole!
What the hell?

845
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:32,183
No! I need to see it!

846
00:54:33,911 --> 00:54:37,910
Oh, my God. No, no!
Die, you freakin' assholes!

847
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:29,206
Okay. New rule.

848
00:55:30,358 --> 00:55:32,471
If somebody falls off the tower,

849
00:55:32,503 --> 00:55:34,423
they bring the cell phone
with them.

850
00:55:34,454 --> 00:55:36,407
And call for help
on the way down.

851
00:55:38,806 --> 00:55:40,310
And maybe post that video.

852
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:44,246
Kidding, ish.

853
00:55:47,767 --> 00:55:48,983
Yeah, my leg.

854
00:55:49,015 --> 00:55:51,190
I could eat aspirin
like Skittles right now.

855
00:55:52,598 --> 00:55:54,358
Yeah.

856
00:55:54,391 --> 00:55:56,022
It's looking a little funky.

857
00:55:56,054 --> 00:55:57,590
Could use some washing, here.

858
00:56:09,014 --> 00:56:10,014
I'm sorry.

859
00:56:19,574 --> 00:56:21,206
We'll just keep it wrapped up.

860
00:56:24,055 --> 00:56:25,174
What's wrong?

861
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:30,967
Dan could never say
the words, "I love you."

862
00:56:33,911 --> 00:56:35,606
1-4-3.

863
00:56:39,895 --> 00:56:41,527
1-4-3.

864
00:56:46,711 --> 00:56:48,918
Becky, I...
How long?

865
00:56:52,918 --> 00:56:54,582
Four months.

866
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,558
It was a huge mistake.

867
00:57:01,591 --> 00:57:05,238
I'm sorry, I am so, so sorry.

868
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:07,607
For sleeping with my husband
or me finding out about it?

869
00:57:07,639 --> 00:57:09,590
For falling in love
with the same guy.

870
00:57:40,118 --> 00:57:42,582
Who made the move?

871
00:57:42,614 --> 00:57:44,502
- Both super drunk.
- Who?

872
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,470
He did.

873
00:57:50,358 --> 00:57:54,230
But it was a huge,
huge mistake, Becks.

874
00:57:57,527 --> 00:57:58,527
No.

875
00:57:59,606 --> 00:58:02,006
A mistake is a kiss.
A one-night stand.

876
00:58:03,383 --> 00:58:05,718
You said you loved him, so...

877
00:58:08,726 --> 00:58:10,550
It got out of hand.

878
00:58:10,582 --> 00:58:15,350
I tried so hard not to,
but I fell for him. I mean...

879
00:58:15,382 --> 00:58:18,295
He listened to me, he was...

880
00:58:18,326 --> 00:58:20,246
He was just different
than every other douche bag

881
00:58:20,278 --> 00:58:21,463
that I'd ever dated and...

882
00:58:23,479 --> 00:58:25,303
And I'd never
felt that way before.

883
00:58:27,479 --> 00:58:29,119
And then you asked me
to be your maid of honor

884
00:58:29,143 --> 00:58:30,742
and it all hit me
like a ton of bricks,

885
00:58:30,775 --> 00:58:32,215
how messed up this all was.

886
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:36,374
I loved him,

887
00:58:38,326 --> 00:58:40,694
but I love you more,
so I ended it.

888
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:46,934
It was just so hard
seeing you guys together.

889
00:58:48,631 --> 00:58:50,134
And after Dan died, I...

890
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:53,270
I just didn't have the strength

891
00:58:53,303 --> 00:58:54,678
to be there for you.

892
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:56,822
To be strong enough
for you, so...

893
00:58:57,911 --> 00:58:59,063
So, I ran away.

894
00:59:00,823 --> 00:59:02,870
And now you hate me
and I don't blame you,

895
00:59:02,903 --> 00:59:05,462
and now we're stuck on
this stupid, freaking tower

896
00:59:05,494 --> 00:59:07,190
in the middle
of freaking nowhere.

897
00:59:08,374 --> 00:59:09,623
And it's all my fault.

898
00:59:11,383 --> 00:59:14,231
I am so, so sorry.

899
01:00:25,367 --> 01:00:27,766
What's that?

900
01:00:27,798 --> 01:00:30,103
I set it when we dropped
the phone down yesterday.

901
01:00:32,215 --> 01:00:33,814
It's been 24 hours.

902
01:00:36,887 --> 01:00:38,678
I think it's time to accept

903
01:00:38,711 --> 01:00:40,543
that either your 60,000
followers don't give a shit

904
01:00:40,567 --> 01:00:43,158
or your phone's down there
in a million pieces.

905
01:00:43,799 --> 01:00:46,231
Okay.

906
01:00:46,262 --> 01:00:49,367
Well, we've got one
more shot. Your phone.

907
01:00:49,399 --> 01:00:51,127
Yeah, no padding
this time, though.

908
01:00:51,158 --> 01:00:52,886
Even less of a chance.

909
01:00:52,918 --> 01:00:54,798
And if this fails we really
don't have any hope.

910
01:00:58,070 --> 01:00:59,831
How long till we die of thirst?

911
01:01:01,334 --> 01:01:02,654
It's just killing me
that our water

912
01:01:02,678 --> 01:01:04,694
is just right down there
in that bag.

913
01:01:06,358 --> 01:01:08,663
Yeah, with the drone.

914
01:01:08,695 --> 01:01:10,998
We could've used that
to get help.

915
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:14,006
We could have flown it back to our
motel with a good old fashioned note.

916
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:21,014
Wait, maybe I can get it.

917
01:01:22,646 --> 01:01:23,831
What do you mean?

918
01:01:23,863 --> 01:01:25,438
You said it was too smooth.
No footholds.

919
01:01:25,462 --> 01:01:26,846
Yeah, but when I hung
my cell down yesterday,

920
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:29,206
I think the rope was
long enough to reach it.

921
01:01:31,703 --> 01:01:33,559
Are you serious?
Yeah.

922
01:01:35,383 --> 01:01:37,046
Yeah, I seriously think
I can get it.

923
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:47,446
Hunter, I don't think
this is a good idea.

924
01:01:47,478 --> 01:01:49,975
Becky, I don't think
we have a choice.

925
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:52,150
Every hour that passes,
the weaker we get.

926
01:01:56,471 --> 01:01:58,358
Besides...

927
01:01:58,391 --> 01:02:00,343
Maybe you'll get lucky
and I'll fall.

928
01:02:10,838 --> 01:02:11,894
Hunter.

929
01:02:15,542 --> 01:02:16,542
Be careful.

930
01:02:19,351 --> 01:02:20,503
I'm sorry, Becks.

931
01:02:22,102 --> 01:02:23,254
I love you.

932
01:02:34,934 --> 01:02:36,023
Okay.

933
01:02:45,175 --> 01:02:46,550
Are you okay?

934
01:02:47,543 --> 01:02:48,543
Yeah.

935
01:02:49,878 --> 01:02:51,191
Yeah, all good.

936
01:02:58,007 --> 01:02:59,478
Okay.

937
01:03:06,295 --> 01:03:07,295
Okay.

938
01:03:14,966 --> 01:03:16,022
Hunter, careful.

939
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:18,878
Shit.

940
01:03:20,023 --> 01:03:22,135
I can't quite reach it.

941
01:03:22,166 --> 01:03:23,478
Just come back up.

942
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:25,015
We'll attach it lower.
Come on.

943
01:03:25,046 --> 01:03:26,935
Shit.

944
01:03:30,518 --> 01:03:32,150
I think I can drop myself lower.

945
01:03:32,182 --> 01:03:33,974
What?

946
01:03:34,006 --> 01:03:36,182
What the hell
are you doing, Hunter?

947
01:03:37,495 --> 01:03:38,495
Hunter!

948
01:03:46,103 --> 01:03:47,103
Shit.

949
01:03:54,583 --> 01:03:57,206
I think I can swing to it.
Hunter, no!

950
01:03:57,238 --> 01:03:59,383
Hunter! Come back up!

951
01:03:59,414 --> 01:04:00,599
Hunter, no!

952
01:04:00,631 --> 01:04:01,782
Hunter!

953
01:04:08,023 --> 01:04:09,430
Are you okay?

954
01:04:11,606 --> 01:04:12,606
Yeah.

955
01:04:17,206 --> 01:04:19,382
Is there a way down?

956
01:04:19,414 --> 01:04:22,198
No. The ladder ripped
all the way off.

957
01:04:33,143 --> 01:04:34,143
Water.

958
01:04:37,751 --> 01:04:40,246
Oh, my God.
Wait, Hunter.

959
01:04:40,278 --> 01:04:42,422
How are you gonna
get back on the rope?

960
01:04:46,294 --> 01:04:47,294
Uh.

961
01:04:48,086 --> 01:04:49,367
Shit.

962
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:53,078
Can... Can you reach it?

963
01:05:06,647 --> 01:05:08,246
Oh, my God.

964
01:05:22,742 --> 01:05:23,742
Shit.

965
01:05:28,278 --> 01:05:30,326
You okay?
Yeah.

966
01:05:30,358 --> 01:05:31,766
I have an idea.

967
01:05:41,047 --> 01:05:42,646
Okay.

968
01:05:42,678 --> 01:05:44,822
I'm gonna try
to hook it on with this,

969
01:05:44,854 --> 01:05:47,510
and then we're gonna
work together to pull me up.

970
01:05:47,542 --> 01:05:49,751
Okay?
That's amazing.

971
01:05:49,783 --> 01:05:51,903
That's some good MacGyver
shit right there.

972
01:06:19,447 --> 01:06:21,655
Oh, come on. Please.
Come on.

973
01:06:24,503 --> 01:06:26,742
You did it!
Okay.

974
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:29,911
Okay. I'm gonna
jump onto this.

975
01:06:29,942 --> 01:06:31,958
I'm gonna need
your help to pull me up.

976
01:06:31,991 --> 01:06:33,462
Okay.
Get ready, Becks.

977
01:06:33,494 --> 01:06:35,446
Okay.
Okay.

978
01:06:36,023 --> 01:06:37,046
Okay.

979
01:06:40,567 --> 01:06:42,407
Okay, come on, come on.
Come on, you can do it.

980
01:06:51,862 --> 01:06:53,014
Shit.

981
01:06:53,047 --> 01:06:55,094
Hunter, are you okay?
You okay?

982
01:06:57,878 --> 01:07:00,086
Okay. I'm okay.

983
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:02,039
Let's do this
fast and quick, Becky.

984
01:07:02,071 --> 01:07:03,607
Work together to pull me up.

985
01:07:03,638 --> 01:07:06,806
Okay.
I climb, you pull.

986
01:07:06,839 --> 01:07:10,070
Okay? Okay, now!

987
01:07:39,158 --> 01:07:40,951
I can almost reach the ladder.

988
01:07:45,847 --> 01:07:46,967
Almost there, Becks.

989
01:07:53,879 --> 01:07:55,255
Okay.

990
01:08:25,238 --> 01:08:27,415
Becky! I landed on the bag!

991
01:08:27,446 --> 01:08:29,622
Oh, my God...
Are you okay?

992
01:08:29,654 --> 01:08:33,014
I hurt my hands, real bad.
I don't think I can climb.

993
01:08:33,047 --> 01:08:34,903
You're gonna
have to pull me up, okay?

994
01:08:34,934 --> 01:08:36,086
Okay. Okay.

995
01:08:39,767 --> 01:08:40,790
I got you.

996
01:09:17,047 --> 01:09:18,047
Oh, shit.

997
01:09:21,014 --> 01:09:23,030
Oh, no. Are you okay?

998
01:09:23,063 --> 01:09:25,622
Shit. I thought
you died there.

999
01:09:25,654 --> 01:09:27,350
I'm not going anywhere, Becks.

1000
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:29,783
Yeah, that was scary.

1001
01:09:37,271 --> 01:09:38,966
We should ration it.
Okay.

1002
01:09:38,998 --> 01:09:39,998
You're right.

1003
01:09:41,303 --> 01:09:43,542
Is there any food in there?

1004
01:09:43,574 --> 01:09:45,782
No, it's just
your cherry lip balm.

1005
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:47,927
I don't think you can eat that.

1006
01:09:47,959 --> 01:09:50,039
Okay. It's getting dark.

1007
01:09:50,071 --> 01:09:52,598
I think it's now or never
on that drone.

1008
01:09:52,631 --> 01:09:56,374
I guess we need to...
We need to write a note.

1009
01:09:56,407 --> 01:09:58,487
Okay, the receipt
from the diner.

1010
01:09:58,519 --> 01:10:02,006
A pen... Do you have a pen?
Eye liner in here.

1011
01:10:02,038 --> 01:10:03,598
Aren't you glad
I brought up makeup now?

1012
01:10:06,199 --> 01:10:07,766
"Help.

1013
01:10:07,798 --> 01:10:12,823
"Stuck on top of B-67 Tower.
Call 911."

1014
01:10:14,614 --> 01:10:15,830
Yeah, perfect.

1015
01:10:19,766 --> 01:10:22,038
Okay. See that?

1016
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:24,407
That's the road
where we almost got wiped out.

1017
01:10:24,439 --> 01:10:26,870
It leads to the motel.

1018
01:10:26,902 --> 01:10:28,662
Let's do this while
we still have light.

1019
01:10:32,183 --> 01:10:33,430
Okay.

1020
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:38,431
Okay, just keep it straight
and follow the line of the road.

1021
01:10:38,455 --> 01:10:40,438
Let it drift down
as it goes. Okay.

1022
01:10:53,686 --> 01:10:55,223
Okay.

1023
01:10:55,255 --> 01:10:57,622
Okay, we're almost
past the gate.

1024
01:10:57,655 --> 01:10:58,847
Oh, my God.

1025
01:10:58,871 --> 01:11:00,127
- No, no, no. The battery.
- What?

1026
01:11:00,151 --> 01:11:02,294
It's running out of juice.
Oh, shit.

1027
01:11:02,326 --> 01:11:04,694
Hit retrieve.
Or has it gone too far?

1028
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:06,583
Is it gonna make it?
There's no chance!

1029
01:11:06,614 --> 01:11:08,342
Are you sure?
It's not even at the gate.

1030
01:11:08,374 --> 01:11:09,942
Shit. It's dropping.

1031
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:10,934
Hit retrieve, hit
retrieve... Hunter.

1032
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:11,990
...hit retrieve.
Okay.

1033
01:11:13,303 --> 01:11:14,782
- It's coming back.
- Fly it up.

1034
01:11:14,806 --> 01:11:16,190
Give it the best shot
to get back to us.

1035
01:11:16,214 --> 01:11:17,934
Come on, just get it
higher, higher, higher.

1036
01:11:19,862 --> 01:11:21,686
Just get it higher!
I'm trying.

1037
01:11:23,095 --> 01:11:24,086
We'll grab it
when it gets close.

1038
01:11:24,119 --> 01:11:25,302
Okay.

1039
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,230
Okay.
We've got this.

1040
01:11:31,607 --> 01:11:33,142
Get it, Becks, get it.

1041
01:11:36,182 --> 01:11:38,231
Nice! Good job.

1042
01:11:50,422 --> 01:11:52,278
We have a charger,
but we don't have any power.

1043
01:11:53,206 --> 01:11:54,518
Maybe just turn it off

1044
01:11:54,551 --> 01:11:56,191
and once it's rested,
it will have more juice.

1045
01:11:56,215 --> 01:11:58,583
It's never gonna
be enough. Hunter.

1046
01:12:07,798 --> 01:12:09,622
What are we gonna do?

1047
01:12:09,655 --> 01:12:11,702
Hey, we're not gonna panic.

1048
01:12:11,734 --> 01:12:14,006
We're gonna stay calm.

1049
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:15,926
We're gonna figure it out, okay?

1050
01:12:15,959 --> 01:12:17,174
There's gotta be a way.

1051
01:12:20,534 --> 01:12:21,942
Are we gonna die?

1052
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:23,606
No.

1053
01:12:24,439 --> 01:12:26,006
No, we're gonna be okay.

1054
01:12:53,974 --> 01:12:55,574
Hunter. Hunter...

1055
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:58,070
Where are you? Hunter...

1056
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:06,270
Hunter...

1057
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:09,527
Hunter, where are you?

1058
01:13:13,303 --> 01:13:15,350
Hunter. Hunter!

1059
01:14:15,734 --> 01:14:16,855
Becky, it's okay.

1060
01:14:17,879 --> 01:14:19,799
You just had a bad dream.

1061
01:14:19,831 --> 01:14:21,719
You're nice and safe,

1062
01:14:21,751 --> 01:14:25,078
2,000 feet up
in the middle of nowhere.

1063
01:14:33,655 --> 01:14:35,510
I have an idea.

1064
01:14:35,542 --> 01:14:36,887
How to charge the drone.

1065
01:14:38,551 --> 01:14:39,863
Your dumb life hack.

1066
01:14:40,886 --> 01:14:42,743
Becky, you freakin' genius.

1067
01:14:49,942 --> 01:14:51,991
I think it's light
enough now. Let's do it.

1068
01:15:11,095 --> 01:15:12,918
Okay, it's a standard
bulb fitting,

1069
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:14,423
but it's gonna be hot.

1070
01:15:14,455 --> 01:15:16,310
It's 30 feet but it's
gonna feel like 1,000.

1071
01:15:20,311 --> 01:15:22,646
Is your leg okay?
Yeah.

1072
01:15:22,678 --> 01:15:24,662
It smells,
but it doesn't hurt anymore.

1073
01:15:24,694 --> 01:15:25,694
It's fine.

1074
01:15:26,582 --> 01:15:27,582
Okay.

1075
01:15:31,511 --> 01:15:32,630
You can do this.

1076
01:15:41,143 --> 01:15:42,519
Yeah!
Yeah.

1077
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:47,606
Keep going, Becky.

1078
01:15:52,246 --> 01:15:53,431
You got this, Becky.

1079
01:16:03,446 --> 01:16:05,111
I can't.

1080
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:06,582
It's okay, it's okay.

1081
01:16:06,614 --> 01:16:08,215
I can't.

1082
01:16:08,246 --> 01:16:09,718
You can do it, Becky.

1083
01:16:10,454 --> 01:16:11,454
You got it.

1084
01:16:14,807 --> 01:16:16,375
It's okay.

1085
01:16:16,406 --> 01:16:18,551
It's just like pole dancing.

1086
01:16:18,583 --> 01:16:21,271
Um... Okay, <i>Cherry Pie.</i>

1087
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:34,678
Whoo!

1088
01:16:42,358 --> 01:16:43,478
Whoo!

1089
01:16:47,191 --> 01:16:48,191
Yes!

1090
01:16:53,815 --> 01:16:55,159
You did it,
my little cherry pie.

1091
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:56,246
Good job!

1092
01:16:58,871 --> 01:17:00,631
Okay.
Yeah!

1093
01:17:00,662 --> 01:17:02,582
You did it, cherry pie!

1094
01:17:04,759 --> 01:17:05,846
All right. All right.

1095
01:17:07,126 --> 01:17:08,599
Okay. Okay.
Remember, it's hot.

1096
01:17:11,383 --> 01:17:12,383
Be careful.

1097
01:17:30,487 --> 01:17:32,534
Okay, just think back
to the diner.

1098
01:17:32,567 --> 01:17:34,902
You're gonna want to line
the prongs of the charger

1099
01:17:34,934 --> 01:17:36,982
with the elements
of the bulb socket.

1100
01:17:42,646 --> 01:17:44,150
I don't think it's long enough.

1101
01:17:44,183 --> 01:17:45,974
I think the back prong
doesn't reach.

1102
01:17:46,007 --> 01:17:47,702
Okay, you're gonna need

1103
01:17:47,734 --> 01:17:50,582
something small and metal
to carry the current, like a...

1104
01:17:50,614 --> 01:17:53,750
Like a screw or something
that you can jam in there.

1105
01:17:53,783 --> 01:17:56,471
There isn't anything.
Jesus. Um...

1106
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:26,486
It's working!
It's freaking working!

1107
01:18:26,519 --> 01:18:28,439
Holy shit, my hero!

1108
01:18:28,471 --> 01:18:31,063
Okay, we're gonna need
a full charge.

1109
01:18:31,094 --> 01:18:33,686
I don't know.
It just has four lights.

1110
01:18:33,718 --> 01:18:35,767
Okay, we have to
charge it all the way.

1111
01:18:35,798 --> 01:18:37,558
Give ourselves the best shot.

1112
01:18:37,591 --> 01:18:38,839
You gonna be okay?

1113
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:40,278
Yeah.

1114
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:41,310
I got this.

1115
01:19:10,391 --> 01:19:11,479
You okay?

1116
01:19:12,599 --> 01:19:14,102
Yeah.

1117
01:19:14,134 --> 01:19:15,254
Hang in there, Becks.

1118
01:19:16,726 --> 01:19:18,199
Past halfway.

1119
01:19:38,551 --> 01:19:39,798
Get off of me!

1120
01:19:47,702 --> 01:19:50,486
It's okay, it's okay,
Becky. You've got it.

1121
01:19:51,638 --> 01:19:53,270
Three lights.

1122
01:19:57,398 --> 01:19:59,414
Come on, Becky, you're so close.

1123
01:20:05,942 --> 01:20:08,023
Get the hell away from me!

1124
01:20:13,879 --> 01:20:14,879
You did it!

1125
01:20:20,278 --> 01:20:21,494
Jesus, I'm so proud of you.

1126
01:20:25,399 --> 01:20:28,087
Why didn't you
catch the bag? Uh...

1127
01:20:28,118 --> 01:20:29,942
Babe, you okay?

1128
01:20:36,854 --> 01:20:40,246
We need to fly that thing
when the motel is the busiest.

1129
01:20:40,278 --> 01:20:42,614
Checkout, 10:00 a.m.

1130
01:20:42,647 --> 01:20:44,215
Just a couple of hours.

1131
01:21:11,639 --> 01:21:13,559
You know,
he was right about Dan.

1132
01:21:13,591 --> 01:21:15,319
He was just trying to help me.

1133
01:21:17,878 --> 01:21:19,894
And I was so horrible to him.

1134
01:21:22,999 --> 01:21:25,462
If there was anyone I
could text, it would be him.

1135
01:21:25,495 --> 01:21:26,551
Just to say...

1136
01:21:28,214 --> 01:21:29,591
I'm so sorry.

1137
01:21:32,086 --> 01:21:33,302
I love him.

1138
01:21:39,798 --> 01:21:41,047
I'm tapping out here.

1139
01:21:42,646 --> 01:21:44,215
Stay with me.

1140
01:21:44,246 --> 01:21:47,030
Try to keep your mind occupied.

1141
01:21:47,063 --> 01:21:49,687
Tell me something,
something that...

1142
01:21:49,718 --> 01:21:51,574
That you and your dad
used to do together.

1143
01:21:55,158 --> 01:21:56,726
We would watch wrestling.

1144
01:21:58,135 --> 01:22:01,142
WWE.
Yeah.

1145
01:22:01,174 --> 01:22:03,127
I forgot you guys
were into that.

1146
01:22:03,158 --> 01:22:04,310
Yeah.

1147
01:22:04,343 --> 01:22:06,806
It was our thing, you know.

1148
01:22:06,838 --> 01:22:08,215
He was always said

1149
01:22:08,246 --> 01:22:12,983
I'd be world champion
with my fighting spirit.

1150
01:22:13,015 --> 01:22:15,671
I always felt so close to him
when we would watch it.

1151
01:22:18,839 --> 01:22:21,110
Name some of
your favorite wrestlers.

1152
01:22:24,535 --> 01:22:27,094
Uh, "Stone Cold" Steve Austin.

1153
01:22:28,279 --> 01:22:30,775
The Rock.

1154
01:22:30,806 --> 01:22:34,103
What was Cactus Jack's name
when he was wearing the mask?

1155
01:22:34,135 --> 01:22:35,478
Mankind.

1156
01:22:36,854 --> 01:22:38,262
Mankind.

1157
01:22:40,246 --> 01:22:42,102
Wait, I thought you said
you didn't watch it.

1158
01:22:42,134 --> 01:22:43,639
I didn't.

1159
01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:45,590
Keep going,
you need to stay awake.

1160
01:22:48,118 --> 01:22:49,334
Batista.

1161
01:22:54,902 --> 01:22:56,791
Okay. It's checkout time.

1162
01:22:59,959 --> 01:23:01,430
Okay, here it goes.

1163
01:23:08,438 --> 01:23:10,070
Just keep that shit straight.

1164
01:23:10,102 --> 01:23:11,894
Follow the line of the road.

1165
01:23:16,726 --> 01:23:18,007
Come on, you son of a...

1166
01:23:23,927 --> 01:23:25,751
I'm past the point of no return,

1167
01:23:25,783 --> 01:23:27,830
so how's the battery?

1168
01:23:27,863 --> 01:23:29,238
Should I retrieve?

1169
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:31,607
No, keep going.

1170
01:23:34,166 --> 01:23:36,311
Come on, come on,
just follow the road.

1171
01:23:43,063 --> 01:23:44,063
Oh, shit.

1172
01:23:49,847 --> 01:23:51,799
It's gonna work.

1173
01:24:00,214 --> 01:24:01,463
Oh, God.

1174
01:24:05,143 --> 01:24:06,143
No.

1175
01:24:08,311 --> 01:24:10,871
Screw your truck.
Get the drone!

1176
01:24:10,903 --> 01:24:12,055
Get it!

1177
01:24:16,886 --> 01:24:19,414
No, no, no, no!

1178
01:24:19,447 --> 01:24:22,262
Go back! Go back.

1179
01:24:22,294 --> 01:24:25,559
No, no, no. Go back!

1180
01:24:25,591 --> 01:24:26,742
Go back!

1181
01:24:31,574 --> 01:24:32,983
Fuck, no!

1182
01:25:20,087 --> 01:25:21,943
Is that a storm?

1183
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:25,783
It's kind of beautiful
from up here.

1184
01:25:31,831 --> 01:25:34,166
I can't survive another night.

1185
01:25:34,198 --> 01:25:35,606
Becky, don't talk like that.

1186
01:25:39,223 --> 01:25:40,726
I just...

1187
01:25:40,758 --> 01:25:43,958
I just wanna sleep.
You can't sleep.

1188
01:25:43,991 --> 01:25:46,518
The vultures,
they can smell your leg.

1189
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:48,670
They're waiting for you to
give up so they can attack.

1190
01:25:52,342 --> 01:25:54,102
Survival of the fittest.

1191
01:25:55,222 --> 01:25:57,142
You need energy.

1192
01:25:57,175 --> 01:25:59,062
We should eat something.

1193
01:25:59,095 --> 01:26:01,015
What?

1194
01:26:01,046 --> 01:26:04,247
We're 2,000 feet up in
the middle of the desert.

1195
01:26:04,279 --> 01:26:06,134
There's no food up here.

1196
01:26:06,167 --> 01:26:07,735
There's always something.

1197
01:26:10,711 --> 01:26:12,310
It's hopeless.

1198
01:26:16,342 --> 01:26:18,551
Let's send another message.

1199
01:26:18,583 --> 01:26:20,663
We can pad the cell
better this time.

1200
01:26:20,695 --> 01:26:23,030
With what?
Give me your shoe.

1201
01:26:23,062 --> 01:26:25,559
I can't.
Why?

1202
01:26:25,591 --> 01:26:27,991
It's not up here, is it?
What?

1203
01:26:30,838 --> 01:26:32,119
It's down there.

1204
01:26:33,622 --> 01:26:34,934
It's on your foot.

1205
01:26:36,406 --> 01:26:37,495
Yes.

1206
01:26:39,382 --> 01:26:45,175
But I'm down there, remember?

1207
01:26:50,327 --> 01:26:51,862
I fell.

1208
01:26:55,063 --> 01:26:57,622
<i>You can't have the shoe,</i>

1209
01:26:57,655 --> 01:26:59,671
<i>because I didn't catch the bag.</i>

1210
01:27:00,823 --> 01:27:02,262
<i>I bled out.</i>

1211
01:27:19,127 --> 01:27:22,486
You didn't really think your scrawny
ass could pull me up, did you?

1212
01:27:35,926 --> 01:27:37,334
You pulled the bag up.

1213
01:27:45,718 --> 01:27:47,831
<i>I guess you were just too afraid</i>

1214
01:27:47,863 --> 01:27:51,222
to realize that
you were up here,

1215
01:27:51,254 --> 01:27:53,431
<i>all alone.</i>

1216
01:29:05,654 --> 01:29:07,030
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

1217
01:29:09,078 --> 01:29:11,894
<i>I wanted you to know that I...</i>

1218
01:29:11,926 --> 01:29:14,006
<i>I found my fight again.</i>

1219
01:29:17,815 --> 01:29:19,199
<i>Please leave your message...</i>

1220
01:29:20,662 --> 01:29:22,039
<i>I wanna live.</i>

1221
01:29:23,671 --> 01:29:25,366
<i>I wanna go home,</i>

1222
01:29:27,671 --> 01:29:30,583
<i>but I'm not gonna make it.</i>

1223
01:29:36,022 --> 01:29:38,231
<i>You were right
about everything and I...</i>

1224
01:29:39,287 --> 01:29:40,918
<i>I'm sorry, Dad.</i>

1225
01:29:46,774 --> 01:29:48,631
<i>By the time you see this...</i>

1226
01:29:51,254 --> 01:29:52,342
<i>I'll be gone.</i>

1227
01:30:00,247 --> 01:30:01,846
<i>I love you.</i>

1228
01:31:33,719 --> 01:31:35,447
That's it! Fuck!

1229
01:31:58,998 --> 01:32:00,247
<i>You need energy.</i>

1230
01:32:01,334 --> 01:32:02,710
<i>You should eat something.</i>

1231
01:32:07,127 --> 01:32:08,854

1233
01:32:48,182 --> 01:32:49,367
<i>Give me your shoe.</i>

1234
01:34:05,207 --> 01:34:06,550
Hunter.

1235
01:34:19,735 --> 01:34:21,238
God, I love you.

1236
01:34:53,047 --> 01:34:54,295
I'm sorry.

1237
01:34:55,031 --> 01:34:56,758
I'm so sorry,

1238
01:34:56,791 --> 01:34:58,558
but I really have to make
sure this gets through.

1239
01:34:58,582 --> 01:35:00,406
God, God, I'm sorry.

1240
01:36:16,438 --> 01:36:17,623
You can't park here.

1241
01:36:17,654 --> 01:36:20,503
Becky! Becky!

1242
01:36:26,198 --> 01:36:27,223
No.

1243
01:36:28,951 --> 01:36:30,103
No.

1244
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:34,615
Dad?

1245
01:36:34,646 --> 01:36:35,646
Dad?

1246
01:36:36,950 --> 01:36:37,950
Dad!

1247
01:36:44,150 --> 01:36:46,615
I thought that was you.

1248
01:36:46,646 --> 01:36:50,231
Dad, I love you.
I'm so sorry.

1249
01:36:51,446 --> 01:36:52,886
It's okay.

1250
01:36:55,127 --> 01:36:56,119
I just...

1251
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:57,814
I just want you to be okay.

1252
01:37:01,847 --> 01:37:03,542
I am, you know.

1253
01:37:03,574 --> 01:37:04,694
I'm gonna be okay.

1254
01:37:05,783 --> 01:37:07,255
Really.

1255
01:37:21,718 --> 01:37:22,903
Let's go home.
