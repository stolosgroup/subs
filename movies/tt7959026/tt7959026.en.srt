2
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:31,821
Hey, Jose.

3
00:01:31,823 --> 00:01:33,856
The way you drive around
in this taco wagon,

4
00:01:33,858 --> 00:01:35,724
you'd think
you'd want to be deported.

5
00:01:35,726 --> 00:01:37,294
Okay, <i>culero.</i>

6
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:38,594
Yeah.

7
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:54,313
Oh, here he comes now.

8
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:01,685
Fashionably late, Earl.

9
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:03,720
Helen, Helen, Helen.

10
00:02:03,722 --> 00:02:04,988
You look sensational.
Sensational.

11
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,756
Aw. You look
pretty good yourself.

12
00:02:06,758 --> 00:02:07,991
It's been a long time.

13
00:02:07,993 --> 00:02:09,260
I brought you
a little something

14
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,495
from my latest cultivar.

15
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,431
Oh! You charming old devil.
This is lovely.

16
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,565
Yes, I'll sign in right here.

17
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:15,999
Hi.

18
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:17,268
- Okay.
- So talented.

19
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,976
Tim Kennedy.

20
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,876
My God.

21
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,044
As I live and breathe.
I thought you were dead.

22
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,883
No such luck, I guess.

23
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,017
Let me tell you something.

24
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,719
Did anyone ever tell you

25
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,354
you're a bit
of an asshole, Earl?

26
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,889
- All the time.
- All the time.

27
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,357
- Even in Spanish.
- Yeah, okay.

28
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,392
Oh, ladies.
You're on the wrong floor.

29
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,794
Third floor
is the beauty pageant.

30
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:46,998
Oh, Earl.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,867
It's literally so easy.
My niece set this up for me.

32
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,336
You just click one button

33
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,070
and you can buy
whatever you want.

34
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,506
With one click from home,

35
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,408
you get a choice of everything
on our line.

36
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,942
All the information is sent

37
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,478
and the flowers arrive to you
just two days later.

38
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,878
The first person to sign up

39
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,980
gets a 20% discount
off their first order.

40
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,816
Internet. Who needs it?

41
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,020
There you go.

42
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:10,422
- Hi, Earl. They're beautiful.
- All right.

43
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:13,458
Here, you get some.
And here, you take these.

44
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,825
Thanks, Earl.

45
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,562
Oh, you're most welcome.
You're most welcome.

46
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:18,230
You're most welcome.

47
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:19,531
Yes, ma'am.

48
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:23,335
Here's some. And for you.
Yeah, you're most welcome.

49
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:25,370
- Earl!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:29,107
You'd think I'm giving away
free Viagra or something.

51
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,475
What's going on here?

52
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,711
- Thanks, Earl.
- I'll take one, Earl!

53
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,279
I'll take one, too.

54
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:37,617
I just... A wonderful thing
you're doing here today.

55
00:03:37,619 --> 00:03:39,652
Earl, is that Jimmy Stewart?

56
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:41,119
<i>And now,</i>

57
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,488
<i>the moment
we've all been waiting for.</i>

58
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,525
<i>The NDL 2005
Gold Medal winner is</i>

59
00:03:45,527 --> 00:03:47,260
<i>Earl Stone,</i>

60
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:50,896
<i>with his Sunnyside Meadows'
Illinois Majestic daylily.</i>

61
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:51,964
<i>Earl!</i>

62
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:07,981
- Congratulations again, Earl.
- Thank you.

63
00:04:07,983 --> 00:04:11,384
<i>No booing, no booing.
Thank you very much.</i>

64
00:04:11,386 --> 00:04:14,622
<i>And rather than give a long,
boring speech,</i>

65
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:16,923
<i>I just wanted to tell you
a little joke. And that's...</i>

66
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:21,227
<i>Why did the horticulturist
walk across the hotel lobby?</i>

67
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:22,929
Why?

68
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:24,364
<i>'Cause he wanted
to get to the bar,</i>

69
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:26,032
<i>and that's exactly
where I'm headed.</i>

70
00:04:26,034 --> 00:04:27,767
<i>Thank you!</i>

71
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:37,711
Where is he?
He'll be here, right?

72
00:04:37,713 --> 00:04:39,181
Don't hold your breath, honey.

73
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,717
Grandpa Earl will be here.
He promised.

74
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:45,820
Oh, my poor girls.

75
00:04:52,862 --> 00:04:54,261
There's no sign of him.

76
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:57,166
Well, he'll be here.
It's my wedding day.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,134
I love you, Iris, I do.

78
00:05:00,136 --> 00:05:02,671
But you have to face facts.

79
00:05:02,673 --> 00:05:05,640
Your father has always
chose work over family.

80
00:05:05,642 --> 00:05:07,141
He missed your baptism,

81
00:05:07,143 --> 00:05:10,478
your confirmation,
your graduation.

82
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,646
Countless birthdays.

83
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:13,947
Not to mention
most of our anniversaries.

84
00:05:15,284 --> 00:05:16,884
I think I'm going to be sick.

85
00:05:16,886 --> 00:05:19,554
Who's gonna give Mommy away?

86
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:22,357
Oh, well...

87
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:25,360
- Oh, honey, my sweet Ginny.
- Iris.

88
00:05:25,362 --> 00:05:28,363
Hon. Can we have
another little reload here?

89
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:29,863
Another Crown Royal, Earl?

90
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:32,167
Yeah. In fact,
get the whole bar one.

91
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:34,938
Them, too? The wedding party?

92
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:39,974
Them, too.

93
00:05:39,976 --> 00:05:42,410
All right.
A round for everybody on Earl!

94
00:05:42,412 --> 00:05:44,546
I'll drink to that.

95
00:05:55,859 --> 00:05:57,327
Okay.

96
00:06:04,535 --> 00:06:06,537
Here you go, <i>amigos.</i>

97
00:06:08,606 --> 00:06:10,341
Sorry it couldn't be more.

98
00:06:12,143 --> 00:06:14,377
Damn Internet,
it ruins everything.

99
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:16,145
So what are you gonna do?

100
00:06:16,147 --> 00:06:19,181
I don't know. I've never been
a plan-B type of guy.

101
00:06:19,183 --> 00:06:21,386
- <i>Gracias, amigo.</i>
- My pleasure.

102
00:06:22,487 --> 00:06:23,488
Thank you.

103
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:25,988
I'll find something.

104
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,191
<i>Gracias.</i>

105
00:06:45,878 --> 00:06:48,010
Grandpa Earl! You're here!

106
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:51,113
Yeah. Hey, Ginny.
You look wonderful.

107
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:53,550
I knew you'd make it
to the pre-wedding brunch.

108
00:06:53,552 --> 00:06:55,052
Oh, I'm so excited.

109
00:06:56,688 --> 00:06:58,388
Is everything okay?

110
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,022
Oh, yeah,
don't worry about that.

111
00:07:00,024 --> 00:07:01,758
That's just a minor setback.

112
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,261
- It'll be just fine.
- Okay. Well, come on in.

113
00:07:04,263 --> 00:07:05,362
I don't care what they say.

114
00:07:05,364 --> 00:07:06,630
You're always welcome.
Come on.

115
00:07:06,632 --> 00:07:08,098
Okay.
All right, you first.

116
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,433
I just gotta grab
something inside,

117
00:07:09,435 --> 00:07:10,875
then I'll introduce you
to everybody.

118
00:07:11,837 --> 00:07:13,205
Ooh.

119
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:16,206
Oh, my God.

120
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,909
You saved all my cards.

121
00:07:17,911 --> 00:07:20,577
Ever since
the first one you sent me,

122
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:21,846
when I was nine.

123
00:07:21,848 --> 00:07:24,181
It was the Corn Palace?

124
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:27,150
Um... Okay.
I want you to meet Mike.

125
00:07:27,152 --> 00:07:29,419
Okay? He's my fiance.
Don't forget.

126
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:33,990
Fiance. All right.
Okay, fiance.

127
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:35,091
You need help with that?

128
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:36,259
It's fine. Thank you.

129
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:37,730
- Mom.
- Jesus.

130
00:07:43,803 --> 00:07:46,370
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I can't stay if he's here.

131
00:07:46,372 --> 00:07:48,475
- I'll wait in the car, Mom.
- No. Honey.

132
00:07:49,074 --> 00:07:50,510
Honey.

133
00:07:52,078 --> 00:07:55,146
Oh, well, of course.

134
00:07:55,148 --> 00:07:57,648
You're not here because of
the wedding. No, no.

135
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,052
You're here because you had
nowhere else to go.

136
00:08:01,054 --> 00:08:02,587
Again!

137
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:05,723
And you promised Ginny you'd
help pay for the wedding.

138
00:08:05,725 --> 00:08:08,125
It's fine, Grandma.
We can just make it BYOB.

139
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:11,062
No, it's not fine.
It's never been fine.

140
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:12,129
Why don't you
knock it off?

141
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:13,665
Oh, man, he's in deep shit.

142
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,132
Just stop it.

143
00:08:15,134 --> 00:08:17,703
Come back doing the same
old shit all the time.

144
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,237
How dare you come in here

145
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:20,672
and make all this fuss
right here in front of her.

146
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:22,273
Because you weren't there
for your own daughter,

147
00:08:22,275 --> 00:08:24,543
and now you're letting
down your granddaughter?

148
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,578
But it's no big surprise,
you know why?

149
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,779
Yeah, why?

150
00:08:27,781 --> 00:08:29,548
You were never a real father
or a husband.

151
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,450
I was on the road
60 hours a week

152
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:33,084
to provide for this family.

153
00:08:33,086 --> 00:08:34,820
What the hell
are you talking about?

154
00:08:34,822 --> 00:08:38,857
On the road providing?
Ha! You know what you do?

155
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:40,726
You play with your friends.

156
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,395
You sit around and hand
each other trophies

157
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,999
- for watching seeds sprout.
- Trophies?

158
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:48,135
- Mr. Daylily.
- You fucking...

159
00:08:49,837 --> 00:08:51,472
Ginny, come here, please.

160
00:08:57,012 --> 00:08:59,746
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

161
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,179
It's okay, Grandma.
Thank you.

162
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:02,421
Oh, I'm so sorry, darling.

163
00:09:05,152 --> 00:09:07,119
They did the alterations.

164
00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:08,955
I'll see you next week,
sweet girl.

165
00:09:08,957 --> 00:09:10,659
Thank you, Grandma.

166
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,535
I'm sorry, darling. I'm sorry.

167
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,371
I'll be going.

168
00:09:25,072 --> 00:09:27,509
Be right back.

169
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:33,981
Bitch. Bitch.

170
00:09:33,983 --> 00:09:35,350
Hey, man.

171
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:40,988
Weddings make everyone crazy.

172
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,923
Always some kind of drama.

173
00:09:42,925 --> 00:09:44,827
Yeah. You got that right.

174
00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:49,596
Looks like you covered
some ground in your day.

175
00:09:49,598 --> 00:09:51,164
Yeah.

176
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,233
Forty-one states out of 50.

177
00:09:54,235 --> 00:09:57,103
Never had a ticket, nothing.
Just drive.

178
00:09:57,105 --> 00:09:58,539
I never had a problem.

179
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,307
This old truck is great.
Got a good record.

180
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,209
- No tickets, huh?
- Nah-uh.

181
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:04,511
Never had one.

182
00:10:04,513 --> 00:10:06,647
Ever in my life,
I've never had one.

183
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,849
My grandpa was
a real road warrior, too.

184
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:10,149
He loved to drive.

185
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,455
Yeah. Well,
let's hear it for gramps.

186
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,888
I'm Richard. Rico.

187
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,191
I'm a friend of one of
Ginny's bridesmaids.

188
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:19,360
Yeah, okay, Rico.
My name's Earl.

189
00:10:19,362 --> 00:10:22,763
Hey, Earl, you know,
if you're really stuck...

190
00:10:22,765 --> 00:10:26,133
I know some people who would
pay you to just drive,

191
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:27,603
one city to another.

192
00:10:28,304 --> 00:10:29,906
Pay me to just drive?

193
00:10:31,074 --> 00:10:32,707
What do you get
out of it, slick?

194
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:35,643
All I'm saying is,
I have friends

195
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:38,579
looking for cautious drivers
like you.

196
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:39,648
Yeah.

197
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,284
You could help
your granddaughter.

198
00:10:44,153 --> 00:10:46,188
All righty.

199
00:10:50,527 --> 00:10:51,793
Huh.

200
00:10:51,795 --> 00:10:53,463
Just drive.

201
00:10:54,097 --> 00:10:56,900
Okay. All right.

202
00:11:07,377 --> 00:11:10,247
It says "tire shop,"
but which one?

203
00:11:53,024 --> 00:11:54,690
<i>Hola.</i> I'm Earl.

204
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:56,726
<i>Hola, hola,</i> Earl.

205
00:11:56,728 --> 00:11:59,261
Where do you want us to
cut the compartment, huh?

206
00:11:59,263 --> 00:12:01,363
Under the seat?
The wheel well?

207
00:12:01,365 --> 00:12:03,267
Do what to the compartment?

208
00:12:04,402 --> 00:12:05,971
Cut up your truck.

209
00:12:07,873 --> 00:12:11,775
What are you talking about?
Cutting up the...

210
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:15,344
Look, nobody's gonna cut up
this truck, understand?

211
00:12:15,346 --> 00:12:17,379
Put whatever you want
right back there,

212
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:19,651
next to the golf clubs.
It'll be safe.

213
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:21,720
No problem.

214
00:12:25,023 --> 00:12:27,224
You're fucking crazy, huh?

215
00:12:27,226 --> 00:12:28,725
Yeah.

216
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:34,664
- Take it.
- What's this?

217
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,568
You answer this,
day or night...

218
00:12:38,003 --> 00:12:39,503
But you don't call anyone.

219
00:12:39,505 --> 00:12:42,741
When you get to the drop,
someone will text you.

220
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:44,376
Text?

221
00:12:45,211 --> 00:12:47,410
You know how to text?

222
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:48,845
Well...

223
00:12:52,484 --> 00:12:54,754
Hold on to the phone.

224
00:12:58,091 --> 00:13:02,660
If it rings, you answer. Here.

225
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:05,963
When you get to the hotel,
park your truck.

226
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:09,432
Put the keys
in the glove compartment.

227
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:11,435
Then come back in an hour.

228
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:12,870
Your money

229
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:15,473
will be in the glove
compartment with the keys.

230
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:17,375
Do you understand?

231
00:13:17,377 --> 00:13:18,843
<i>Si, si.</i>

232
00:13:18,845 --> 00:13:20,845
I understand.
But what would happen

233
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:23,483
if somebody steals the money
or my truck?

234
00:13:24,484 --> 00:13:26,317
No one will fuck with it.

235
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:28,021
We got eyes everywhere,
<i>viejito.</i>

236
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:30,755
<i>Oye, viejito.</i>

237
00:13:30,757 --> 00:13:32,991
Do yourself a favor.

238
00:13:32,993 --> 00:13:34,826
Don't look in that bag.

239
00:13:34,828 --> 00:13:37,461
You might think
you can identify us,

240
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:39,530
or know
about this tire shop,

241
00:13:39,532 --> 00:13:41,967
but don't forget,

242
00:13:41,969 --> 00:13:44,435
we know who you are.

243
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:45,636
<i>Comprende.</i>

244
00:13:45,638 --> 00:13:48,541
I'm not gonna look
in anybody's bag.

245
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,511
Okay, papa.

246
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:56,784
Thank you.

247
00:14:05,626 --> 00:14:07,127
Come on.

248
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:13,734
<i>Adios!</i>

249
00:14:19,074 --> 00:14:22,008
Welcome to the team,
Agent Bates.

250
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,375
Thank you, sir.

251
00:14:23,377 --> 00:14:25,945
Go ahead and have a seat.

252
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:29,115
So, how's your family
adjusting to the move?

253
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:30,817
Do they like the city?

254
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:32,986
I'm assuming
you don't want the truth.

255
00:14:32,988 --> 00:14:34,354
No.

256
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:36,956
Listen, you made some
big cases in New York and D.C.

257
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,092
and I'm expecting you
to do the same thing here.

258
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:40,760
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

259
00:14:40,762 --> 00:14:42,829
No one wants to sit through
these long Chicago winters

260
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:45,298
but we got crime
coming out of our ass.

261
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,933
That's how
you get out of here.

262
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:51,372
Work hard, make cases,
make busts, make your name.

263
00:14:51,374 --> 00:14:53,273
Then maybe you can move on.

264
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:56,310
Well, that's the best news
I've heard all week.

265
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,212
Good.

266
00:14:58,214 --> 00:15:01,382
Now get out there and make
a splash, Special Agent.

267
00:15:01,384 --> 00:15:02,751
Yes, sir.

268
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:08,389
Agent Bates?

269
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:09,689
- Agent Trevino?
- Yes, sir.

270
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:11,624
- Pleasure.
- So, I'll be your number one.

271
00:15:11,626 --> 00:15:13,593
- Yeah, I heard. It's an honor.
- Yeah.

272
00:15:13,595 --> 00:15:15,762
- Uh, how you feeling?
- I feel good.

273
00:15:15,764 --> 00:15:17,965
Ready to make a big splash?

274
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:20,267
- He says that to everybody.
- Yeah, he does.

275
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:21,668
That's all right.

276
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,638
So your office is out here,
to the right.

277
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,640
Well, I'm not gonna spend
too much time there.

278
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:28,342
Hopefully not.

279
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,811
<i>Jesus
says that he came to seek</i>

280
00:15:30,813 --> 00:15:34,081
<i>and save that which is lost.</i>

281
00:16:38,782 --> 00:16:43,386
Jesus, it's like the <i>Star Wars</i>
cantina in there.

282
00:16:43,388 --> 00:16:45,920
Yeah, it's where
all the homies hang out.

283
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,790
It doesn't look
like a <i>TED Talks.</i>

284
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:51,127
It's my kid's.
He helps me pack.

285
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:52,194
You got kids?

286
00:16:52,196 --> 00:16:54,463
Yeah, five of 'em.

287
00:16:54,465 --> 00:16:57,634
Five. How do you make
that work in a job like this?

288
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:00,271
We just make it work.

289
00:17:03,908 --> 00:17:06,642
Ah, the plot thins.

290
00:17:06,644 --> 00:17:08,611
- Why's that?
- This is our guy.

291
00:17:08,613 --> 00:17:10,982
Yeah.

292
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:18,756
Right there.

293
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:50,689
Shit.

294
00:17:57,596 --> 00:17:59,665
Oh, shit.

295
00:18:06,805 --> 00:18:08,972
- Yeah?
- You did good.

296
00:18:08,974 --> 00:18:10,173
Supposed to tell you
to call this number

297
00:18:10,175 --> 00:18:11,442
any time you need work,
all right?

298
00:18:11,444 --> 00:18:13,009
Here you go.

299
00:18:13,011 --> 00:18:15,881
No, no, no, no. This is just
a one-time deal for me.

300
00:18:16,748 --> 00:18:18,149
Well, I tell you what, man,

301
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:19,916
why don't you call us
if you change your mind?

302
00:18:19,918 --> 00:18:22,322
You know what I'm saying?
Here you go. Take the number.

303
00:18:23,256 --> 00:18:25,857
Here.

304
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:27,191
Why don't you save that
for a rainy day?

305
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:28,326
Yeah.

306
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:30,461
Yeah, a rainy day. Okay.

307
00:18:30,463 --> 00:18:32,563
All right, let's go. Come on.
Let's move it up out of here.

308
00:18:32,565 --> 00:18:33,766
All right.

309
00:18:35,068 --> 00:18:36,701
All right.

310
00:18:39,772 --> 00:18:43,407
It's the starter,
the starter's pretty ratty.

311
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:48,980
Let's go. Come on.
Back it up.

312
00:18:48,982 --> 00:18:50,417
All right. I got it.

313
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,898
Everybody's
on their cell phone.

314
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,233
It's becoming an epidemic.

315
00:19:08,235 --> 00:19:09,434
What do you think
you're doing?

316
00:19:09,436 --> 00:19:10,735
Who the hell are you guys?

317
00:19:10,737 --> 00:19:12,670
My name is
Special Agent Colin Bates,

318
00:19:12,672 --> 00:19:14,173
this is Agent Trevino.

319
00:19:14,175 --> 00:19:16,041
We're with the Drug
Enforcement Administration.

320
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:18,243
And you're Luis Rocha.

321
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:20,479
And we're here
to save your life.

322
00:19:20,481 --> 00:19:22,214
I beg your pardon?

323
00:19:22,216 --> 00:19:24,449
We're gonna make sure
your cartel doesn't know

324
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:26,418
you're working for the DEA.

325
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,153
I'm not working for the DEA.

326
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:29,855
No, but that's what they'll
think if you don't,

327
00:19:29,857 --> 00:19:32,525
so welcome aboard.

328
00:19:32,527 --> 00:19:34,460
Wait, I don't know
what you're talking about.

329
00:19:34,462 --> 00:19:36,195
- I like the Tahitian Pearl.
- Mmm.

330
00:19:36,197 --> 00:19:37,930
- It's got, like, a nice sheen.
- Mmm.

331
00:19:37,932 --> 00:19:39,467
Think about it, Luis.

332
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:44,571
We got a warrant
to search your house.

333
00:19:44,573 --> 00:19:45,804
What?

334
00:19:45,806 --> 00:19:47,105
Yeah,
we'll see you there.

335
00:19:59,988 --> 00:20:01,988
Hi. I'm gonna interrupt
for a second.

336
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,724
- I'm sorry.
- He's yours.

337
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,543
<i>Hi, everyone.</i>

338
00:20:22,545 --> 00:20:26,513
<i>Before I get over-served...</i>

339
00:20:26,515 --> 00:20:28,915
<i>...we'd just like to take
a moment</i>

340
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:31,019
<i>to say thank you. Um...</i>

341
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,420
<i>Mom,</i>

342
00:20:33,422 --> 00:20:34,754
<i>I love you.</i>

343
00:20:34,756 --> 00:20:36,523
- Aw.
<i>- I love you so much.</i>

344
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:39,326
<i>Grandma Mary,
thank you so, so much</i>

345
00:20:39,328 --> 00:20:40,960
<i>for everything
that you've done.</i>

346
00:20:40,962 --> 00:20:43,564
<i>Um... Oh.</i>

347
00:20:43,566 --> 00:20:47,134
<i>And to my Grandpa Earl,</i>

348
00:20:47,136 --> 00:20:49,536
<i>who brought the flowers,
of course.</i>

349
00:20:49,538 --> 00:20:52,241
<i>And covered the open bar.</i>

350
00:20:56,012 --> 00:20:57,380
<i>So, thank you.</i>

351
00:21:10,293 --> 00:21:11,294
Hi.

352
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:14,130
Hey.

353
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:16,932
You look lovely tonight.

354
00:21:23,373 --> 00:21:24,872
It's kinda funny,

355
00:21:24,874 --> 00:21:26,874
our granddaughter
getting married.

356
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:31,146
And we worried all those years
about her finding Mr. Right.

357
00:21:31,148 --> 00:21:32,846
Earl, why do you think

358
00:21:32,848 --> 00:21:34,249
you could just sit down

359
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,285
and expect me to forget
about the past and

360
00:21:37,287 --> 00:21:40,190
reminisce about old times?

361
00:21:41,892 --> 00:21:46,729
Well, we had 10 good years.

362
00:21:46,731 --> 00:21:48,498
We can still be civil.

363
00:21:56,574 --> 00:21:57,908
Care to dance?

364
00:21:59,076 --> 00:22:00,977
You always liked this tune.

365
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:02,447
I do.

366
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:08,151
No, I can't. I just can't.

367
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:11,220
I can't.

368
00:22:11,222 --> 00:22:13,857
I see you're still
into your flowers.

369
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:15,458
Yeah.

370
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,260
I never understood
how you could spend

371
00:22:18,262 --> 00:22:21,499
so much time
and money on them.

372
00:22:24,435 --> 00:22:29,038
I love 'em.
I mean, they're unique.

373
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,173
They just bloom one day

374
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:33,509
and that's the end of it.

375
00:22:33,511 --> 00:22:36,047
They deserve
all the time and effort.

376
00:22:37,115 --> 00:22:40,084
So did your family.

377
00:23:36,175 --> 00:23:38,578
Not bad, <i>viejito,</i>
not bad.

378
00:23:39,846 --> 00:23:41,779
Damn!

379
00:23:41,781 --> 00:23:43,581
Badass, right there.

380
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,182
New ride. Nice.

381
00:23:45,184 --> 00:23:47,951
Yeah. Badass is right.

382
00:23:47,953 --> 00:23:49,487
- Yeah.
- This is beautiful.

383
00:23:49,489 --> 00:23:52,425
Yeah, the old one
finally quit on me.

384
00:23:54,661 --> 00:23:57,028
Hey, Earl.

385
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,697
- Got a little present for you.
- Oh.

386
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:01,466
Oh, what's in that?

387
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:03,701
Your <i>jale,</i> old man.
Your cargo.

388
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:08,575
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

389
00:24:11,144 --> 00:24:12,412
All right.

390
00:24:15,415 --> 00:24:16,682
Hey, what's going on,
big poppa?

391
00:24:16,684 --> 00:24:18,316
Yeah, good.
Just everything good.

392
00:24:18,318 --> 00:24:19,718
I'm just on the road again.

393
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,220
- You're king pimping, huh?
- Uh-huh, yeah.

394
00:24:22,222 --> 00:24:24,222
Kind of like that.

395
00:24:24,224 --> 00:24:26,425
- Yeah?
- Same as before.

396
00:24:26,427 --> 00:24:29,294
It rings, you answer.
Day or night.

397
00:24:29,296 --> 00:24:30,629
Yeah, well, you know,

398
00:24:30,631 --> 00:24:32,196
I've got this other one
from before, too.

399
00:24:32,198 --> 00:24:34,867
- Oh, yeah. Let me see.
- Yeah.

400
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:37,036
- Yep.
- Ah, I see.

401
00:24:39,473 --> 00:24:43,108
Hey, that was
a perfectly good phone.

402
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,978
What's going on?

403
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,779
Earl, you throw
your phone away

404
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:50,082
when your run is done.

405
00:24:50,084 --> 00:24:52,686
I don't suppose you learned
how to text yet either, huh?

406
00:24:53,855 --> 00:24:55,889
Uh, I can text.

407
00:24:55,891 --> 00:24:57,222
I'll be able to.

408
00:24:57,224 --> 00:24:59,324
Next time you see me,
I'll be texting.

409
00:24:59,326 --> 00:25:00,760
Texting my brains out.

410
00:25:00,762 --> 00:25:01,895
Okay.

411
00:25:01,897 --> 00:25:03,428
Looking good, <i>abuelito.</i>

412
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,165
Okay.

413
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:10,837
Hey, Earl.

414
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,137
Yeah?

415
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:13,406
Same hotel as before.

416
00:25:13,408 --> 00:25:15,909
Yeah, same hotel.
I'll be there.

417
00:25:15,911 --> 00:25:17,345
Okay.

418
00:25:17,846 --> 00:25:19,579
<i>Vamos.</i>

419
00:26:28,684 --> 00:26:30,551
1980 Shovelhead.

420
00:26:30,553 --> 00:26:32,455
I ran one of those things
into the ground.

421
00:26:33,489 --> 00:26:36,860
It'll probably be
the relay, son.

422
00:26:37,928 --> 00:26:39,462
Who you calling "son"?

423
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,564
Oh, you're gals, huh?

424
00:26:42,566 --> 00:26:46,668
Gals? Come on, old-timer,
we're dykes on bikes.

425
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,736
No shit.

426
00:26:50,206 --> 00:26:51,606
Okay, well.

427
00:26:51,608 --> 00:26:53,910
So, you think
that's the issue? The relay?

428
00:26:55,045 --> 00:26:56,778
It's a good early check.

429
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,780
It'll be the relay.

430
00:26:58,782 --> 00:26:59,916
Thanks, Pops.

431
00:27:01,518 --> 00:27:03,286
You're welcome, dykes.

432
00:27:36,587 --> 00:27:38,890
- You crazy motherfucker.
- Crazy old man.

433
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,358
Think about our offer, <i>amigo?</i>

434
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,362
Uh, no. And I'm Filipino,
not Mexican.

435
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:47,930
Oh. Well, that's a good thing.

436
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,533
It'll be harder for the cartel
to get to your family.

437
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:53,736
Why do you think
I'd work for you guys?

438
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:57,473
I mean, we found drugs,
$425,000 in cash

439
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,910
and three unlicensed firearms
in your house,

440
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:01,477
so I mean, that's a start.

441
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,947
Not to mention fraud,
tax evasion, money laundering,

442
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,648
state and federal drug laws
you've broken.

443
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,117
I mean, conservatively,
I'd say

444
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,919
you're looking at back-to-back
life sentences.

445
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,689
And I'm no psychic, but...

446
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,158
Looking at your manicured
nails and your exfoliated skin

447
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,626
and your scented candles,

448
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:17,928
I don't think you're gonna
fare too well in prison.

449
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,563
Oh, it's definitely
bitch material.

450
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:22,032
You'd be somebody's girlfriend
in a day.

451
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,034
You wouldn't like that,
would you?

452
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,069
And that's before
the cartel gets to you.

453
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:29,341
So, what do you think, Luis?
Are we gonna be friends?

454
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,709
What do I do?

455
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,644
Just do your job,
go back to work,

456
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:35,912
be a good cartel employee

457
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,282
and answer my calls
day and night.

458
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,652
- Okay.
- Good.

459
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:48,725
The foreclosure
will be canceled

460
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,161
with your
reinstatement payment.

461
00:28:50,163 --> 00:28:52,529
Plus late fees
and incidentals.

462
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:53,933
You said you had cash?

463
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:55,601
Yeah.

464
00:28:57,971 --> 00:28:59,505
Right here.

465
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:02,709
Okay.

466
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:15,688
Piece of shit. Motherfucker.

467
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:47,085
The hell happened here? Fire?

468
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:50,155
Yeah, in the kitchen.
Nobody got hurt.

469
00:29:50,157 --> 00:29:52,224
Oh, good.

470
00:29:52,226 --> 00:29:54,325
I'll have pancakes, then.

471
00:29:54,327 --> 00:29:56,462
Yeah. Yeah.

472
00:29:58,098 --> 00:30:01,400
Unfortunately, the insurance
company's jerking us around.

473
00:30:01,402 --> 00:30:03,435
We might not see
any money for years.

474
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:04,903
Yeah.

475
00:30:04,905 --> 00:30:08,006
Well, I've been coming here
since '58.

476
00:30:08,008 --> 00:30:09,875
This place is like
an institution.

477
00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:12,344
I don't know what the hell
the vets are gonna do.

478
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:13,948
I don't know.

479
00:30:17,185 --> 00:30:19,685
No Sunday night polka parties.

480
00:30:19,687 --> 00:30:21,321
No more meat raffles.

481
00:30:21,323 --> 00:30:25,691
What the hell, pretty soon
it'll be no more VFW.

482
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:30,031
Yeah, I guess so.
Well, that is unless, uh...

483
00:30:32,366 --> 00:30:37,072
Not unless somebody's got
an extra 25K laying around.

484
00:30:39,841 --> 00:30:40,842
Hmm.

485
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:22,349
How do, how do, how do.

486
00:31:22,351 --> 00:31:24,417
<i>Bienvenidos, Senor</i> Earl.
Welcome back.

487
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:25,653
Oh, thank you, thank you.

488
00:31:25,655 --> 00:31:26,820
What's up, big poppa?

489
00:31:26,822 --> 00:31:27,955
Oh, not too much,
not too much.

490
00:31:27,957 --> 00:31:29,422
- Same old, same old.
- Mmm-hmm.

491
00:31:29,424 --> 00:31:31,125
Just on the highway.

492
00:31:31,127 --> 00:31:32,427
What's going on?

493
00:31:36,132 --> 00:31:38,601
Look at this. Wow.

494
00:31:39,535 --> 00:31:41,135
What's in that? That's big.

495
00:31:41,137 --> 00:31:42,805
Don't worry about it.

496
00:31:44,807 --> 00:31:47,908
- Hey, Earl?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

497
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,111
- It rings, you do what?
- I answer.

498
00:31:50,113 --> 00:31:51,912
- That's my man. Big poppa.
- Okay.

499
00:31:51,914 --> 00:31:53,114
I got you.

500
00:31:53,116 --> 00:31:55,050
Remember, <i>con cuidado</i>
when you drive.

501
00:31:55,052 --> 00:31:56,351
Just drive safely.

502
00:31:56,353 --> 00:31:57,651
- Okay.
- <i>Si.</i>

503
00:31:57,653 --> 00:32:00,823
Drive safely. All right. Okay.

504
00:32:03,126 --> 00:32:06,660
Hey, Earl.
Keep your eyes open.

505
00:32:06,662 --> 00:32:09,130
- All right. I will.
- All right.

506
00:32:09,132 --> 00:32:11,768
- Okay. All right.
<i>- Vamonos.</i>

507
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,530
Holy shit. Holy shit.

508
00:33:13,698 --> 00:33:15,266
Need help, sir?

509
00:33:16,368 --> 00:33:18,567
Oh, uh... Officer, hi.

510
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:19,802
Need any help?

511
00:33:19,804 --> 00:33:21,670
Uh, no, no.
I'm fine, thank you.

512
00:33:21,672 --> 00:33:23,072
- What do you got there?
- Uh...

513
00:33:23,074 --> 00:33:26,443
Pecans. I'm delivering pecans
to my niece.

514
00:33:26,445 --> 00:33:27,977
- Pecans?
- Yeah, pecans.

515
00:33:27,979 --> 00:33:30,280
She makes the worst pecan pie
you've ever tasted.

516
00:33:30,282 --> 00:33:32,516
I feel sorry
for her husband, but...

517
00:33:32,518 --> 00:33:33,958
And I feel sorry
for the pecans, too.

518
00:33:36,288 --> 00:33:38,221
I don't know
what's wrong with him now,

519
00:33:38,223 --> 00:33:41,224
but this dog has to pee
every 15 minutes.

520
00:33:41,226 --> 00:33:42,591
Dogs.

521
00:33:42,593 --> 00:33:44,763
Oh, shit.

522
00:33:49,034 --> 00:33:51,336
It's all right. All right,
calm down. Come on.

523
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:12,622
Hi!

524
00:34:12,624 --> 00:34:15,894
Hi. Hi, doggy! How ya doing?

525
00:34:16,695 --> 00:34:18,029
Take a sniff of that.

526
00:34:18,031 --> 00:34:19,430
I'm sorry, sir,
I'm gonna have to ask you

527
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,565
not to touch the animal.

528
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:22,066
Oh.

529
00:34:22,068 --> 00:34:23,367
- I'm sorry, Officer.
- It's okay. It's okay, sir.

530
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:24,801
I had no idea. I'm sorry.

531
00:34:24,803 --> 00:34:27,271
- My Dukie, I miss him so much.
- It's okay, sir.

532
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,605
Dukie, you know,

533
00:34:28,607 --> 00:34:31,476
Dukie just one of those dogs
that everybody loves.

534
00:34:31,478 --> 00:34:32,877
- Drive safely, sir.
- Okay.

535
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,345
- You can go now.
- Yeah, thank you.

536
00:34:34,347 --> 00:34:36,716
You do a great Jimmy Stewart,
by the way.

537
00:34:38,251 --> 00:34:39,819
Yeah. Fuck.

538
00:34:58,104 --> 00:34:59,871
Let me
explain something, Luis.

539
00:34:59,873 --> 00:35:01,273
For you to get
into witness protection,

540
00:35:01,275 --> 00:35:02,773
you're gonna have to
prove your value.

541
00:35:02,775 --> 00:35:04,476
We win, you win.

542
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:06,411
So we're gonna go
on a little sightseeing tour.

543
00:35:06,413 --> 00:35:08,413
See what kind of value
you can offer.

544
00:35:08,415 --> 00:35:10,781
- You understand?
- Yeah.

545
00:35:10,783 --> 00:35:13,252
Good. Got you a latte.

546
00:35:17,558 --> 00:35:19,057
This is where it start,

547
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:22,361
not just here, but dozens
of hotels across the city.

548
00:35:22,363 --> 00:35:25,931
Mules come in from
various locations, loaded,

549
00:35:25,933 --> 00:35:28,734
leave their vehicles,
someone takes the vehicles,

550
00:35:28,736 --> 00:35:30,202
removes the load,

551
00:35:30,204 --> 00:35:32,605
and returns it
with the mule's payment.

552
00:35:32,607 --> 00:35:36,543
At 121, there's a guy outside.
What's going on here?

553
00:35:36,545 --> 00:35:38,043
121 is ours.

554
00:35:38,045 --> 00:35:40,245
He's just there
to make sure that

555
00:35:40,247 --> 00:35:43,383
they keep an eye on the vans
that come in and out.

556
00:35:43,385 --> 00:35:44,818
What else?

557
00:36:09,511 --> 00:36:11,012
Fuck me.

558
00:36:13,315 --> 00:36:14,816
Oh, shit.

559
00:36:18,853 --> 00:36:22,255
Okay. All right,
just settle down, boy.

560
00:36:22,257 --> 00:36:23,925
Settle down.

561
00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:43,605
All right!

562
00:37:43,607 --> 00:37:44,873
<i>How about putting
your hands together,</i>

563
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:46,241
<i>make a little bit of noise</i>

564
00:37:46,243 --> 00:37:48,009
<i>for Mollie-B
and her polka band.</i>

565
00:37:49,513 --> 00:37:52,581
<i>And a nice thank you
for Earl Stone.</i>

566
00:37:55,852 --> 00:37:59,120
<i>VFW Post 6330 owes this man
a debt of gratitude.</i>

567
00:37:59,122 --> 00:38:00,690
<i>So put your hands together
again for Earl.</i>

568
00:38:00,692 --> 00:38:01,757
<i>What do you say?</i>

569
00:38:04,595 --> 00:38:06,329
Earl! Earl!

570
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:09,130
Now how about shelling out
another bundle

571
00:38:09,132 --> 00:38:11,900
to fix the ice-skating rink
up at the old rec center?

572
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:16,407
Ice rink?

573
00:39:06,725 --> 00:39:08,127
Okay.

574
00:39:20,874 --> 00:39:22,074
Pull!

575
00:39:38,725 --> 00:39:42,260
That old man's
gonna make a full run for us.

576
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,198
Hundred and ten kilos.

577
00:39:48,902 --> 00:39:51,569
It's $2.7 million.

578
00:39:51,571 --> 00:39:55,339
He has no record.
He has no traffic tickets.

579
00:39:55,341 --> 00:39:57,675
I need you to travel with him,
to monitor him

580
00:39:57,677 --> 00:39:59,444
because he can become
our top mule.

581
00:39:59,446 --> 00:40:01,279
Monitor him,
you mean babysit, no?

582
00:40:05,185 --> 00:40:06,451
Are you tired
of being the top guy?

583
00:40:06,453 --> 00:40:07,853
Because I can ask
Gustavo here.

584
00:40:07,855 --> 00:40:09,353
He's always eager to step up.

585
00:40:09,355 --> 00:40:11,475
No, no, no. No. I got it.

586
00:40:16,529 --> 00:40:18,198
Have fun with <i>Tata,</i> Julio.

587
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:22,969
It won't be too bad.
You can always take Sal. Pull!

588
00:40:36,082 --> 00:40:37,449
Who are you?

589
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:40,118
The boss sent me.
I'm your handler.

590
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,256
We're gonna be with you
the whole trip.

591
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,161
Where are the boys?
Where are the fellas here...

592
00:40:49,163 --> 00:40:51,096
Hey, hey, hey.
Never mind the fellas.

593
00:40:51,098 --> 00:40:52,631
Listen to me.

594
00:40:52,633 --> 00:40:54,834
You've been entrusted
with a very valuable cargo,

595
00:40:54,836 --> 00:40:56,470
and I don't trust you.

596
00:40:57,271 --> 00:40:58,938
You do as you're told.

597
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,339
Take the routes I say.

598
00:41:00,341 --> 00:41:03,108
No unauthorized roads,
no unexpected stops.

599
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:06,378
My schedule, my timetable.
Is that clear?

600
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,615
You sure you're Mexican?

601
00:41:08,617 --> 00:41:11,049
You're playing
like you're the <i>Fuhrer</i>

602
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,585
- or something like that.
- Uh-huh.

603
00:41:12,587 --> 00:41:14,787
Yes.
Show me your papers

604
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:16,088
- at the border.
- Yeah.

605
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,924
- Yes. You fucker.
- I'll show you my papers.

606
00:41:17,926 --> 00:41:19,193
Here are my papers.

607
00:41:20,595 --> 00:41:22,228
Don't underestimate
how seriously

608
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,297
I take my work, Mr. Stone.

609
00:41:24,299 --> 00:41:26,232
I've been in combat before.

610
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:29,538
I'm not intimidated by you,
<i>mocoso.</i>

611
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:32,574
Sonny.

612
00:41:40,181 --> 00:41:42,816
Hey, <i>Tata,</i> how's it going?

613
00:41:42,818 --> 00:41:45,485
It's going good.

614
00:41:45,487 --> 00:41:48,022
A little bit too long
on the road and everything.

615
00:41:48,024 --> 00:41:50,290
But it's okay.

616
00:41:50,292 --> 00:41:51,457
How's your nephew?

617
00:41:51,459 --> 00:41:53,027
- He's doing a lot better.
- Oh, good.

618
00:41:53,029 --> 00:41:54,595
Thanks for asking. <i>Gracias.</i>

619
00:41:54,597 --> 00:41:57,263
- Yeah. All right.
- Hey, what's up, big poppa?

620
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:01,602
Okay. All right. Okay.

621
00:42:01,604 --> 00:42:04,905
I was okay with the little
letters and stuff,

622
00:42:04,907 --> 00:42:06,941
but you see, when I come
around to numbers...

623
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:09,243
Yeah, I can help you
with that. Easy. <i>Mira.</i>

624
00:42:09,245 --> 00:42:10,377

- Yeah.

626
00:42:11,747 --> 00:42:13,514
And it takes you back.
Pay attention now.

627
00:42:13,516 --> 00:42:14,982
- Emilio.
- Julio...

628
00:42:16,352 --> 00:42:18,352
- Is his package ready?
- <i>Si.</i>

629
00:42:18,354 --> 00:42:19,653
Then why are you
standing around?

630
00:42:19,655 --> 00:42:20,721
He just pulled in.

631
00:42:20,723 --> 00:42:23,691
I don't care.
Load the truck now.

632
00:42:23,693 --> 00:42:25,693
Hey, what's up, <i>papito?</i>
How's your old lady?

633
00:42:25,695 --> 00:42:27,528
- I got your <i>papito</i> right here.
- Now! Let's go! Move!

634
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:29,931
Great, <i>mein Kommandant.</i>
Very good.

635
00:42:29,933 --> 00:42:31,365
Shut up. Shut up!

636
00:42:31,367 --> 00:42:33,102
Mules don't talk.

637
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:39,741
Somebody ought to cool
his ass down.

638
00:42:41,612 --> 00:42:43,243
Okay, <i>mira, papi.</i>
Pay attention.

639
00:42:43,245 --> 00:42:44,546
You click on the icon here,
all right.

640
00:42:44,548 --> 00:42:45,647
Yeah.

- Numbers pop up. You see that?
- Yeah.

642
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:50,719
Then you just type "7-7-1.

643
00:42:50,721 --> 00:42:54,154
"Joy Drive." Easy.

644
00:42:54,156 --> 00:42:55,525
- Yeah.
- That's the drop site.

645
00:43:19,017 --> 00:43:20,582
I think I got it.

646
00:43:20,584 --> 00:43:21,650
- Icon pops up, numbers pop up.
- He says he's got it.

647
00:43:21,652 --> 00:43:23,719
Let's go. We're running late.

648
00:43:23,721 --> 00:43:25,857
Let's go. Let's go! Move.
<i>Vamos.</i>

649
00:43:28,893 --> 00:43:30,593
Okay.

650
00:43:30,595 --> 00:43:32,327
Come on.
We don't have all day.

651
00:43:32,329 --> 00:43:34,897
All right.

652
00:43:34,899 --> 00:43:37,633
That's right,
shoot the motherfucker.

653
00:43:37,635 --> 00:43:39,101
I will.

654
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:00,952
Oh, wow, thank you.

655
00:45:00,954 --> 00:45:02,552
How you folks doing?

656
00:45:02,554 --> 00:45:05,656
Not so good.
We got a flat.

657
00:45:05,658 --> 00:45:07,658
- A flat tire?
- Yeah.

658
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:11,261
And my husband isn't
too handy, so...

659
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:19,270
Didn't your daddy teach you
how to change a tire?

660
00:45:19,272 --> 00:45:21,539
No. That's why
I'm googling it.

661
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:24,075
I don't have any reception.

662
00:45:24,077 --> 00:45:27,278
Yeah, well, that's the trouble
with this generation.

663
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,313
If you can't open a fruit box

664
00:45:29,315 --> 00:45:31,049
without calling
the Internet...

665
00:45:31,051 --> 00:45:34,685
Anyway, you want a hand?
I'll give you a hand.

666
00:45:34,687 --> 00:45:35,553
Oh, okay.

667
00:45:35,555 --> 00:45:36,889
Yeah, come on.

668
00:45:36,891 --> 00:45:38,825
You get the tire out,
we'll fix it up.

669
00:45:39,325 --> 00:45:40,627
Yeah.

670
00:45:42,963 --> 00:45:45,731
- All right.
- Tire's in there. Great.

671
00:45:45,733 --> 00:45:47,498
- Uh...
- Okay. Keep going.

672
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,668
- Okay.
- Okay.

673
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:51,502
- Ah, here we go.
- Okay.

674
00:45:51,504 --> 00:45:54,173
There it is. Yeah.

675
00:45:54,175 --> 00:45:57,711
Well, this is good.
Helping you Negro folks out.

676
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,648
"Negro"? Sir,
we don't say that anymore.

677
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:05,050
Yeah, we prefer "black."

678
00:46:05,052 --> 00:46:06,718
- "Black" or "people."
- Or just "people."

679
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,120
Yeah. I'm black, you're white.

680
00:46:08,122 --> 00:46:09,555
No shit.

681
00:46:09,557 --> 00:46:11,023
Yeah, no shit.

682
00:46:11,025 --> 00:46:13,926
Okay. Let me
give you a hand here.

683
00:46:13,928 --> 00:46:15,561
- I'll take the jack.
- Okay.

684
00:46:15,563 --> 00:46:17,631
- You get the tire.
- All right.

685
00:46:27,474 --> 00:46:29,476
You are so sweet.

686
00:46:32,613 --> 00:46:34,613
Hey.

687
00:46:34,615 --> 00:46:35,949
My turn.

688
00:46:35,951 --> 00:46:38,184
Oh, my God,
look at this.

689
00:46:38,186 --> 00:46:39,654
My God.

690
00:46:57,772 --> 00:46:59,439
- Would you like...
- Oh, yes.

691
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,443
This is so nice.

692
00:47:55,765 --> 00:47:57,265
<i>Tata,</i> where are you going?

693
00:47:57,267 --> 00:47:58,599
The hotel is right up here!

694
00:47:59,802 --> 00:48:01,202
Move!

695
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:07,177
Hey, move! Hey!

696
00:48:07,911 --> 00:48:09,578
Move! Okay.

697
00:48:14,785 --> 00:48:16,384
Where the hell is he?

698
00:48:16,386 --> 00:48:17,754
- Where's he going?
- Over here.

699
00:48:35,806 --> 00:48:38,575
Who the fuck are you,
<i>ruco?</i> Eh?

700
00:48:39,077 --> 00:48:40,575
I'm Earl.

701
00:48:40,577 --> 00:48:42,078
- Earl?
- Yeah. Earl.

702
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,612
Earl who?
I don't know any fucking Earl.

703
00:48:44,614 --> 00:48:46,250
Earl, the driver.

704
00:48:50,054 --> 00:48:52,388
Get your fucking ass
inside, man.

705
00:49:04,268 --> 00:49:06,569
What the fuck
are you doing here, old man?

706
00:49:06,571 --> 00:49:10,606
I'm just bringing in
my load, that's all.

707
00:49:10,608 --> 00:49:13,509
But you're not supposed
to be here.

708
00:49:13,511 --> 00:49:16,579
Look, the address says
right here. Look.

709
00:49:16,581 --> 00:49:19,083
It's 771 Joy Drive.

710
00:49:20,018 --> 00:49:22,854
Okay. Just don't do it again.

711
00:49:24,722 --> 00:49:26,858
Who the fuck are you, <i>pendejo?</i>

712
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:29,259
I'm his handler.

713
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:32,362
Then handle him.
He ain't supposed to be here.

714
00:49:32,364 --> 00:49:34,665
I'll take care of it.

715
00:49:59,124 --> 00:50:00,125
Eh?

716
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:05,662
Who sent you here?

717
00:50:05,664 --> 00:50:07,764
Who gave you this address?

718
00:50:07,766 --> 00:50:09,833
I don't know.
He was a big guy.

719
00:50:09,835 --> 00:50:12,636
Mexican-looking guy.
He had tattoos all over.

720
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:15,173
Very scary,
at least to this gringo.

721
00:50:15,175 --> 00:50:18,042
Okay, that could be
anyone I know.

722
00:50:18,044 --> 00:50:19,277
What's his name?

723
00:50:19,279 --> 00:50:20,677
I don't know his name.

724
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:21,878
What do I look like,
Alexander Graham Bell?

725
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,114
I don't even know anything

726
00:50:23,116 --> 00:50:24,515
about texting
and all this shit.

727
00:50:24,517 --> 00:50:25,649
I don't know
whose name is who.

728
00:50:25,651 --> 00:50:26,918
- Okay. Okay.
- They all look

729
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,480
the fucking same.

730
00:50:36,196 --> 00:50:37,562
You're a real pain in my ass,

731
00:50:37,564 --> 00:50:39,030
you know that?

732
00:50:39,032 --> 00:50:42,534
Then go see a proctologist.
Don't bother me.

733
00:50:42,536 --> 00:50:44,368
Stop. Where are you going?

734
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:46,737
My pecans are in there.

735
00:50:46,739 --> 00:50:49,340
Fuck your pecans.
Let them do their job.

736
00:50:56,783 --> 00:50:59,719
What's up?

737
00:51:07,328 --> 00:51:09,528
Okay, slow down.
What did he do?

738
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:11,096
What did he do?

739
00:51:11,098 --> 00:51:13,232
He stops wherever he wants.
Eh?

740
00:51:13,234 --> 00:51:15,234
He doesn't
follow my instructions.

741
00:51:15,236 --> 00:51:16,835
He doesn't do
what I tell him to do.

742
00:51:16,837 --> 00:51:18,669
Yesterday he stopped
to see an old friend.

743
00:51:18,671 --> 00:51:20,139
I'm just gonna kill him.

744
00:51:20,141 --> 00:51:21,907
- <i>I won't tolerate...</i>
- Slow down, slow down.

745
00:51:21,909 --> 00:51:23,475
Listen to me. Listen to me.

746
00:51:23,477 --> 00:51:26,645
He moves his own way.
He's been successful.

747
00:51:26,647 --> 00:51:29,648
If he changes his route,
it's probably better for us

748
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:31,316
'cause then
he's less predictable.

749
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:32,651
You understand me?

750
00:51:32,653 --> 00:51:34,887
Yeah, but we don't oblige
the other drivers like this.

751
00:51:34,889 --> 00:51:37,224
You need to oblige me.

752
00:51:37,892 --> 00:51:39,658
Understood?

753
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:40,826
<i>Yeah, understood.</i>

754
00:51:40,828 --> 00:51:42,629
Stay with him.

755
00:51:42,631 --> 00:51:44,696
Make him feel at home.

756
00:51:44,698 --> 00:51:46,301
Other than that...

757
00:51:49,337 --> 00:51:51,106
How you doing?

758
00:51:51,939 --> 00:51:53,972
<i>I'm fine.</i>

759
00:51:53,974 --> 00:51:56,176
Okay. Do your job.

760
00:51:56,178 --> 00:51:57,778
<i>Si. Si.</i>

761
00:52:10,659 --> 00:52:12,192
What do you got?

762
00:52:12,194 --> 00:52:14,027
I'm taking all the risk here.

763
00:52:14,029 --> 00:52:16,229
If they found out that I'm
talking to you guys, I'm dead.

764
00:52:16,231 --> 00:52:17,897
Maybe don't work
with drug dealers.

765
00:52:17,899 --> 00:52:20,802
Got you a latte. Feel better?

766
00:52:21,937 --> 00:52:24,170
So what do you got for us?

767
00:52:24,172 --> 00:52:26,607
I don't know
if I should be doing this.

768
00:52:26,609 --> 00:52:28,210
Oh, what do you got?

769
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,980
What's this?

770
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:34,916
It's a freight manifest.

771
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:37,585
What is this? Code?

772
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:38,918
Symbols for each
of the mules

773
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,920
along with symbols
for their routes,

774
00:52:40,922 --> 00:52:42,822
dates, and cargo loads.

775
00:52:42,824 --> 00:52:45,092
There's this
new drug mule, <i>Tata.</i>

776
00:52:45,094 --> 00:52:48,495
New guy. He's delivered
121 kilos in April,

777
00:52:48,497 --> 00:52:50,998
172 kilos in May,

778
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,234
and then 232 kilos.

779
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:54,935
Jesus Christ.
Could that be right?

780
00:52:54,937 --> 00:52:56,870
This guy's nickname's,
uh, <i>Tata?</i>

781
00:52:56,872 --> 00:52:58,872
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's <i>Tata.</i>

782
00:52:58,874 --> 00:53:01,075
That's good. Good work.

783
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:03,177
I'm just gonna need
to document this.

784
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:05,746
I gotta get that back before
they know it's gone, though.

785
00:53:05,748 --> 00:53:07,181
So if I can just take it now.

786
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:09,116
It's just gonna take a second,
so just relax.

787
00:53:09,118 --> 00:53:12,319
You play hard to get
for a snitch.

788
00:53:12,321 --> 00:53:15,256
And you end up
snitching anyway.

789
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:16,957
I just need...

790
00:53:16,959 --> 00:53:18,526
Just think about
who else you can snitch on

791
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,060
while you're waiting.

792
00:53:20,062 --> 00:53:21,296
No. Come on. I'm just...

793
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,164
Reflect on that.

794
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:24,466
I'm showing
my worth though, right?

795
00:53:24,468 --> 00:53:25,700
I mean, this is...

796
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:26,867
You did great.

797
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:28,103
I know enough
for me to get in.

798
00:53:28,105 --> 00:53:29,271
Here we go.
Good job, thank you.

799
00:53:29,273 --> 00:53:30,572
Get the fuck out of here.

800
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:32,109
Jesus Christ.

801
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:18,487
He couldn't wait.

802
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:20,489
Doesn't know how to
fucking drive. Look at him.

803
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:22,925
Relax, okay?

804
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:23,959
We need to trust him.

805
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:25,428
What else are we gonna do?

806
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,470
We have no other choice.

807
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:53,224
Okay. Thank you.

808
00:55:04,536 --> 00:55:06,236
There you go.

809
00:55:06,238 --> 00:55:08,207
Everyone keeps looking at us.

810
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:12,042
Yeah, well, that's 'cause
they see two beaners

811
00:55:12,044 --> 00:55:14,313
in a bowl full of crackers.

812
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:20,018
Why are we here?

813
00:55:20,854 --> 00:55:22,352
The best pulled pork sandwich

814
00:55:22,354 --> 00:55:23,989
in the whole Midwest,
that's why.

815
00:55:36,736 --> 00:55:38,301
Not bad, huh?

816
00:55:38,303 --> 00:55:41,138
See, what you gotta do is take
more time out, like this.

817
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:43,940
Enjoy life. Like I do.

818
00:55:43,942 --> 00:55:45,545
Maybe.

819
00:55:47,614 --> 00:55:50,815
Or maybe you enjoyed
the moment a little too much.

820
00:55:50,817 --> 00:55:53,384
Had too much fun.

821
00:55:53,386 --> 00:55:55,655
That's why you're working
for us now.

822
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:03,963
Best pulled pork sandwich
in the whole wide world.

823
00:56:11,104 --> 00:56:12,704
No more stopping, <i>Tata.</i>

824
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:14,174
You stay on route.

825
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:17,110
Losing my patience.

826
00:56:19,245 --> 00:56:21,114
What's your business here?

827
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:22,915
Hmm?

828
00:56:25,151 --> 00:56:28,286
I ain't gonna ask you again.

829
00:56:28,288 --> 00:56:30,658
What's your business
in my town?

830
00:56:33,126 --> 00:56:35,327
Officer. Officer.

831
00:56:35,329 --> 00:56:36,895
I can vouch for these fellas.

832
00:56:36,897 --> 00:56:38,029
They're actually
working for me.

833
00:56:38,031 --> 00:56:39,331
You know this guy?

834
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:42,334
Oh, yeah.
I got 'em down at Home Depot.

835
00:56:42,336 --> 00:56:44,136
They came out here, and
they've been helping me move.

836
00:56:44,138 --> 00:56:45,804
Great job.

837
00:56:45,806 --> 00:56:47,606
A lot cheaper than the moving
company, I'll tell you that.

838
00:56:47,608 --> 00:56:50,175
Terrific job.

839
00:56:50,177 --> 00:56:52,211
Yeah, could you come over here
for a second?

840
00:56:52,213 --> 00:56:53,479
There's something
very important

841
00:56:53,481 --> 00:56:54,980
I want to show you
in this truck.

842
00:56:54,982 --> 00:56:56,315
Right here.

843
00:56:56,317 --> 00:56:59,086
Really important.
Really important.

844
00:57:12,567 --> 00:57:14,068
You'll love this.

845
00:57:16,805 --> 00:57:20,005
I went to a charity and I got
this caramelized corn.

846
00:57:20,007 --> 00:57:21,307
And it is really
terrific stuff.

847
00:57:21,309 --> 00:57:22,842
We can't accept
this kind of stuff.

848
00:57:22,844 --> 00:57:24,577
Oh, you'll be doing me
a great favor, if you would.

849
00:57:24,579 --> 00:57:27,280
I've got diabetes.
I can't have it.

850
00:57:27,282 --> 00:57:28,882
They'd love it
down at the station.

851
00:57:28,884 --> 00:57:32,287
And the gals upstairs,
they'll love it, too.

852
00:57:35,223 --> 00:57:37,090
Thank you for helping me, sir.

853
00:57:37,092 --> 00:57:38,793
All right, sir?

854
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:46,734
I'm very big
on law enforcement.

855
00:57:46,736 --> 00:57:48,638
Very supportive.

856
00:57:49,772 --> 00:57:52,073
We appreciate what you do.

857
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:57,410
Yes. Yes.

858
00:57:57,412 --> 00:57:59,145
- <i>Our numbers are down, Special Agent.</i>
- I realize we're down.

859
00:57:59,147 --> 00:58:00,548
The numbers
don't reflect the actuals,

860
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:02,349
and will be adjusted
by the end of the day.

861
00:58:02,351 --> 00:58:03,896
- <i>Fix 'em and send 'em over...</i>
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

862
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,019
<i>Today.</i>

863
00:58:05,021 --> 00:58:06,720
Yes, sir.

864
00:58:06,722 --> 00:58:07,922
What?

865
00:58:07,924 --> 00:58:10,324
Cartel's top mule's
on his way to a drop.

866
00:58:10,326 --> 00:58:11,926
So we know the route.
We know it's a black pickup.

867
00:58:11,928 --> 00:58:14,762
It's a needle in a haystack,
but at least it's a start.

868
00:58:14,764 --> 00:58:16,165
How do we know this?

869
00:58:17,066 --> 00:58:18,832
Phone tap.

870
00:58:18,834 --> 00:58:20,367
They thought their mule
was in an accident.

871
00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:22,738
Turns out it was a pickup
on Interstate 55.

872
00:58:23,439 --> 00:58:24,705
When's he due to arrive?

873
00:58:24,707 --> 00:58:27,207
9:00 p.m.
That puts us five hours out.

874
00:58:27,209 --> 00:58:28,742
So if we have
local law enforcement

875
00:58:28,744 --> 00:58:30,110
stop vehicles
of that description,

876
00:58:30,112 --> 00:58:31,712
do a random road check,

877
00:58:31,714 --> 00:58:33,213
we can catch this guy without
tipping off the cartel.

878
00:58:33,215 --> 00:58:34,683
This is the guy
you think is moving

879
00:58:34,685 --> 00:58:36,851
over 100 kilos
into Chicago a month?

880
00:58:36,853 --> 00:58:37,953
Mmm-hmm.

881
00:58:37,955 --> 00:58:39,386
100 kilos is overzealous,

882
00:58:39,388 --> 00:58:41,288
considering
we're only confiscating

883
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:43,491
five kilos a month.

884
00:58:43,493 --> 00:58:45,829
Is that a yes or a no?

885
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:47,731
Yes.

886
00:58:48,865 --> 00:58:52,168
But I want busts, Agent Bates.

887
00:59:57,568 --> 01:00:00,103
Congratulations, my friend.

888
01:00:00,105 --> 01:00:01,170
About what?

889
01:00:01,172 --> 01:00:03,272
You just broke the record.

890
01:00:03,274 --> 01:00:04,373
- Really?
- Yeah.

891
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:06,943
282 keys in one load.

892
01:00:06,945 --> 01:00:08,745
Oh, my God.

893
01:00:08,747 --> 01:00:10,579
Okay.

894
01:00:10,581 --> 01:00:12,783
The main boss
is really happy about this.

895
01:00:12,785 --> 01:00:14,583
- Yeah. Good.
- He wants to meet you.

896
01:00:14,585 --> 01:00:16,521
- Does he? Does he? Okay.
- Yeah.

897
01:00:42,115 --> 01:00:43,280
Beautiful.

898
01:00:54,293 --> 01:00:55,358
<i>Hola, papi.</i>

899
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,360
Hi, gals. Wow.

900
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,130
- Laton.
- Oh.

901
01:00:59,132 --> 01:01:00,332
Ah.

902
01:01:02,135 --> 01:01:03,568
Welcome to Mexico,
Mr. Stone.

903
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:05,803
Hi, Mr. Laton.
Yes, how are you?

904
01:01:05,805 --> 01:01:07,805
Who do you have to kill
to get a place like this?

905
01:01:07,807 --> 01:01:09,140
Oh, many, many people.

906
01:01:09,142 --> 01:01:10,340
I mean, it's really beautiful.

907
01:01:10,342 --> 01:01:11,876
- Thank you.
- My, my.

908
01:01:11,878 --> 01:01:14,412
What's your pleasure?

909
01:01:14,414 --> 01:01:15,580
What would you like?

910
01:01:15,582 --> 01:01:16,814
I'll have a double.

911
01:01:19,986 --> 01:01:21,352
How was the flight? Good?

912
01:01:21,354 --> 01:01:22,587
Uh, you know,
it was really good.

913
01:01:22,589 --> 01:01:24,088
Really good. A little bumpy.

914
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:25,523
Thank you.
But not too bad.

915
01:01:25,525 --> 01:01:28,359
- Let me show you around.
- It was good.

916
01:01:45,946 --> 01:01:48,613
Don't hurt yourself.

917
01:02:31,392 --> 01:02:33,860
Earl, I want to
introduce you to somebody.

918
01:02:33,862 --> 01:02:35,997
Okay.

919
01:02:37,999 --> 01:02:39,433
- Hi.
- Hello.

920
01:02:41,636 --> 01:02:44,336
Thank you. Thank you, too.

921
01:02:44,338 --> 01:02:46,706
I want you to take good care
of Earl tonight, okay?

922
01:02:46,708 --> 01:02:49,876
Tuck him in and stay with him.
Make him feel good.

923
01:02:49,878 --> 01:02:51,446
Of course.

924
01:02:56,252 --> 01:02:58,086
Don't hurt yourself, <i>Tata.</i>

925
01:02:59,354 --> 01:03:00,689
I won't.

926
01:03:17,439 --> 01:03:18,605
Ah...

927
01:03:18,607 --> 01:03:20,673
- Ah, this is...
- Lay down.

928
01:03:20,675 --> 01:03:22,475
- Beautiful.
- Oh, yeah.

929
01:03:22,477 --> 01:03:24,678
- Yeah.
- Do you like it?

930
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,682
Huh?

931
01:03:32,989 --> 01:03:35,289
I love it. Oh, God.

932
01:03:36,659 --> 01:03:38,492
Sweetheart.

933
01:03:41,464 --> 01:03:43,966
Wow. What do we have here?

934
01:03:44,834 --> 01:03:46,500
Oh! You guys having some fun?

935
01:03:46,502 --> 01:03:51,306
Well, we were just relaxing
a little bit. It was nothing.

936
01:03:51,308 --> 01:03:52,873
I think we'd rather have fun.

937
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:56,077
I think that a little heart
medicine wouldn't hurt.

938
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:59,780
You're fine. Here, let me grab
these lights for you.

939
01:03:59,782 --> 01:04:02,716
- One light will do.
- Yeah, get comfy.

940
01:04:02,718 --> 01:04:04,551
I need to call
a cardiologist.

941
01:04:04,553 --> 01:04:05,956
Doctor Clark.

942
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:20,635
Hey!
Mr. Life Of The Party.

943
01:04:20,637 --> 01:04:22,037
- Yeah.
- You having fun?

944
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:24,005
- Yeah, I am.
- Yeah, you are.

945
01:04:24,007 --> 01:04:26,308
- I saw you.
- I was having fun all right.

946
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:27,776
I've been looking for you.

947
01:04:27,778 --> 01:04:29,277
- For me?
- I was looking for you.

948
01:04:29,279 --> 01:04:30,645
Oh, yeah?

949
01:04:30,647 --> 01:04:32,547
Yeah, I thought I'd give you
a little advice.

950
01:04:32,549 --> 01:04:34,283
You're...
You're giving me advice?

951
01:04:34,285 --> 01:04:35,384
Yeah. Yeah. I...

952
01:04:35,386 --> 01:04:36,518
I pass.

953
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,955
I think you ought to quit.

954
01:04:39,489 --> 01:04:41,090
Quit? Quit what?

955
01:04:41,092 --> 01:04:42,457
Quit this.

956
01:04:42,459 --> 01:04:45,827
Quit here. These people
don't give a crap about you.

957
01:04:45,829 --> 01:04:47,129
You know, you could quit,

958
01:04:47,131 --> 01:04:48,830
find something
you really love to do.

959
01:04:48,832 --> 01:04:50,299
And then go after it.

960
01:04:50,301 --> 01:04:53,402
Wait, wait, wait,
what are you talking about?

961
01:04:53,404 --> 01:04:55,404
Let me tell you
something, okay?

962
01:04:55,406 --> 01:04:56,872
This is my family.
This is my home.

963
01:04:56,874 --> 01:04:58,841
- Yeah.
- Okay? Laton...

964
01:04:58,843 --> 01:05:02,345
He pulled me from the streets.
I was nobody. I was nothing.

965
01:05:02,347 --> 01:05:05,614
Okay? He gave me everything.
And here, I'm somebody.

966
01:05:05,616 --> 01:05:06,916
Yeah.

967
01:05:06,918 --> 01:05:10,086
Yeah. So what are you
talking about?

968
01:05:10,088 --> 01:05:11,654
Well...

969
01:05:11,656 --> 01:05:14,358
Hell, just an idea, you know?

970
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:16,692
Earl, Earl. Wait. No, no.
Where are you going?

971
01:05:16,694 --> 01:05:20,129
Hey, I'm gonna go
up to my room.

972
01:05:20,131 --> 01:05:21,933
There I'm somebody.

973
01:05:24,203 --> 01:05:26,068
No one wants
to tip off the cartel,

974
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:28,105
but we have to show some kind
of progress with this case.

975
01:05:28,107 --> 01:05:30,242
But you're talking about
a PR stunt.

976
01:05:33,045 --> 01:05:35,479
In Arlington, there's a table
of administrators

977
01:05:35,481 --> 01:05:37,481
sitting around just like us,

978
01:05:37,483 --> 01:05:40,450
only they're wondering
what the hell we're doing,

979
01:05:40,452 --> 01:05:42,855
and if maybe someone else
wouldn't be more productive.

980
01:05:43,455 --> 01:05:44,687
Hmm.

981
01:05:44,689 --> 01:05:46,825
We need busts,
Agent Bates.

982
01:05:50,295 --> 01:05:52,029
Well, there's an alleged,
uh, stash house

983
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,296
that might be getting
a shipment

984
01:05:53,298 --> 01:05:54,364
in the next couple of days.

985
01:05:54,366 --> 01:05:55,665
That's more like it.

986
01:05:55,667 --> 01:05:56,900
- Possible busts.
- Good.

987
01:05:56,902 --> 01:05:59,071
Have to look like
local PD, though.

988
01:05:59,805 --> 01:06:01,406
To the cartel.

989
01:06:01,408 --> 01:06:04,076
Our report will reflect
it's from our operation.

990
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:09,581
Do it. But I want busts.

991
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:15,018
You heard the man.

992
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:16,122
It's tricky.

993
01:06:16,822 --> 01:06:18,557
Splish-splash.

994
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:21,558
Any last minute orders?

995
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:25,263
Yeah. Nobody shoot me,
unless absolutely necessary.

996
01:06:25,265 --> 01:06:28,232
Nah, it's your show, Captain.
We're just tourists here.

997
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,101
All right, gentlemen,
you heard the man.

998
01:06:30,103 --> 01:06:32,604
Business as usual.
Weapons hot.

999
01:06:33,506 --> 01:06:34,806
Police!

1000
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:38,376
Get down!

1001
01:06:41,681 --> 01:06:43,381
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

1002
01:06:43,383 --> 01:06:44,651
Get down!

1003
01:06:45,285 --> 01:06:47,187
Move! Stay down!

1004
01:06:54,495 --> 01:06:57,229
Get down! Get down!
Get on the ground!

1005
01:06:57,231 --> 01:06:58,729
Don't even think about it.

1006
01:06:58,731 --> 01:07:00,131
Don't move!

1007
01:07:00,133 --> 01:07:02,267
Five of these.

1008
01:07:02,269 --> 01:07:04,303
We got
what they wanted, I suppose.

1009
01:07:04,305 --> 01:07:05,803
Yeah. Two nobody illegals

1010
01:07:05,805 --> 01:07:07,573
and a few bags of coke
to lay out for the press.

1011
01:07:07,575 --> 01:07:09,141
Guess now I can retire.

I'm just trying to make up

1033
01:08:09,304 --> 01:08:13,074
And, uh, I do feel that
education is important.

1034
01:08:16,778 --> 01:08:19,145

01:08:21,216 --> 01:08:22,884
Yeah. Thank God.

1037
01:08:26,154 --> 01:08:28,957
You? Impossible.

1038
01:08:35,431 --> 01:08:37,096
What's the matter? You okay?

1039
01:08:37,098 --> 01:08:39,766
It's nothing, it's nothing.
It comes and goes.

1040
01:08:39,768 --> 01:08:41,101
- It's nothing.
- All right.

1041
01:08:41,103 --> 01:08:43,671
No worries, no worries.
I'm fine.

1042
01:08:43,673 --> 01:08:45,506
I'm fine.

1043
01:08:45,508 --> 01:08:46,875
- All right.
- I'm fine.

1044
01:08:54,617 --> 01:08:55,683
Pull!

01:09:09,932 --> 01:09:11,433
<i>Gracias.</i>

Pull!

01:09:54,579 --> 01:09:55,812
Gustavo.

1048
01:09:58,782 --> 01:10:00,616
Laton is gone.

1049
01:10:00,618 --> 01:10:02,418
He was getting too lenient.

1050
01:10:08,191 --> 01:10:09,858
The DEA is cracking down,

1051
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:11,026
and I'm not gonna
rot in prison

1052
01:10:11,028 --> 01:10:12,430
because of his deficiencies.

1053
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:15,566
So, I got rid of him.

1054
01:10:17,368 --> 01:10:19,103
It's my show now.

1055
01:10:24,309 --> 01:10:25,410
Hmm.

1056
01:10:26,577 --> 01:10:28,146
No more tardiness.

1057
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,113
No more going off radar.

1058
01:10:31,115 --> 01:10:33,215
Everything goes
according to plan.

1059
01:10:33,217 --> 01:10:35,951
No deviations, no excuses.

1060
01:10:35,953 --> 01:10:37,953
Everybody gets
with the program,

1061
01:10:37,955 --> 01:10:39,155
or they go away.

1062
01:10:39,157 --> 01:10:42,091
I don't care who it is.

1063
01:10:42,093 --> 01:10:45,464
And yes, this goes
for your gringo, too.

1064
01:10:47,098 --> 01:10:48,933
You have a problem with that?

1065
01:10:50,536 --> 01:10:51,537
No.

1066
01:11:11,223 --> 01:11:12,522
Here's your burger.

1067
01:11:12,524 --> 01:11:15,160
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1068
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:37,849

1069
01:11:37,851 --> 01:11:39,419
You follow us.

1070
01:12:10,818 --> 01:12:12,152
Where are we going?

1071
01:12:30,937 --> 01:12:32,306
Get out.

1072
01:12:51,827 --> 01:12:54,028
It's so quiet out here.

1073
01:12:55,931 --> 01:13:00,067
No one for miles.

1074
01:13:04,538 --> 01:13:08,006
I want you to
listen carefully, <i>viejo.</i>

1075
01:13:08,008 --> 01:13:10,342
There's new rules.

1076
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:13,713
You show up on time.
You leave on time.

1077
01:13:13,715 --> 01:13:17,650
No unscheduled stops.
No fucking bullshit, man.

1078
01:13:17,652 --> 01:13:20,689
All orders are to be
followed to the letter.

1079
01:13:30,398 --> 01:13:32,601
We have a gift for you.

1080
01:13:49,084 --> 01:13:50,385
Sal.

1081
01:13:55,825 --> 01:13:58,559
Go. Open, <i>viejo.</i>

1082
01:13:58,561 --> 01:14:01,595
It's a phone for you.
This one you keep.

1083
01:14:01,597 --> 01:14:04,264
You keep it on you
at all times.

1084
01:14:04,266 --> 01:14:06,634
That's someone
who didn't follow orders.

1085
01:14:10,038 --> 01:14:13,509
So you know the routes.

1086
01:14:14,810 --> 01:14:16,712
We're not gonna babysit you,

1087
01:14:17,547 --> 01:14:19,880
but we have eyes everywhere.

1088
01:14:19,882 --> 01:14:21,983
We're only warning you once.

1089
01:14:21,985 --> 01:14:24,118
No more late shit, Earl.

1090
01:14:25,388 --> 01:14:26,620
New boss says,

1091
01:14:26,622 --> 01:14:28,142
you show up late again
and you're done.

1092
01:14:30,961 --> 01:14:33,695
We own your ass, <i>cabron,</i>

1093
01:14:33,697 --> 01:14:35,464
so don't be stupid,

1094
01:14:36,332 --> 01:14:38,167
or you disappear.

1095
01:14:41,872 --> 01:14:43,638
<i>Si.</i>

1096
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:45,272
Answer that phone.

1097
01:14:45,274 --> 01:14:47,176
You do as you're told.

1098
01:14:47,878 --> 01:14:49,276
Don't be a problem.

1099
01:14:49,278 --> 01:14:50,612
That's what happens
when you're a problem.

1100
01:14:50,614 --> 01:14:52,547
You end up
in the goddamn trunk.

1101
01:14:52,549 --> 01:14:55,586
- Julio, <i>mijo...</i>
- No, no, don't "Julio" me.

1102
01:14:56,987 --> 01:14:58,388
We're not friends.

1103
01:15:00,157 --> 01:15:01,725
I'm not your <i>mijo.</i>

1104
01:15:53,311 --> 01:15:55,378
- <i>Orale,</i> Earl. You're back.
- Yeah.

1105
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:56,512
What's up, big poppa?

1106
01:15:56,514 --> 01:15:58,814
Yeah, it's me.

1107
01:15:58,816 --> 01:16:01,484
And I gather
you guys own my ass.

1108
01:16:01,486 --> 01:16:03,619
Oh, come on, man.
It's not that bad.

1109
01:16:03,621 --> 01:16:05,657
Ready for another trip,
<i>una mas?</i>

1110
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:08,457
Okay. All right.

1111
01:16:08,459 --> 01:16:10,660
Come on, <i>viejito.</i>
Let's make some money.

1112
01:16:10,662 --> 01:16:12,294
All right.

1113
01:16:12,296 --> 01:16:13,462
That's the spirit.

1114
01:16:13,464 --> 01:16:15,132
Yeah, that's the Earl I know.

1115
01:16:15,134 --> 01:16:17,601
Yeah!

1116
01:16:17,603 --> 01:16:19,069
- What did he give us?
- Nothing.

1117
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,236
But from the wiretap,

1118
01:16:20,238 --> 01:16:21,270
we know where
the mule's going.

1119
01:16:21,272 --> 01:16:22,806
We know his exact route.

1120
01:16:22,808 --> 01:16:24,841
So this time, we don't use
local PD or state troopers.

1121
01:16:24,843 --> 01:16:26,910
It's Agent Trevino and myself
in an undercover vehicle,

1122
01:16:26,912 --> 01:16:29,381
Agent Brown
in an unmarked making stops.

1123
01:16:30,214 --> 01:16:31,948
- An aircraft.
- And?

1124
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:35,519
And that's it. We pull
the plug on the whole thing.

1125
01:16:35,521 --> 01:16:37,087
All the surveillance,
all the wiretapping,

1126
01:16:37,089 --> 01:16:39,123
man-hours, everything,
it all comes to a head.

1127
01:16:39,125 --> 01:16:40,424
It's a lot of busts.

1128
01:16:40,426 --> 01:16:42,428
- Go get 'er done.
- Okay.

1129
01:16:52,337 --> 01:16:53,973
All right,
let's see what we got.

1130
01:17:08,688 --> 01:17:10,421
They look funny.

1131
01:17:10,423 --> 01:17:11,956
Nah, between the two of them,

1132
01:17:11,958 --> 01:17:14,627
they got no more than three
grams of coke, guaranteed.

1133
01:17:20,934 --> 01:17:22,502
Brown, you see this?

1134
01:17:30,577 --> 01:17:32,978
Yeah, let's pull him over.

1135
01:17:51,397 --> 01:17:54,465
I'm slowly exiting
my vehicle.

1136
01:17:54,467 --> 01:17:56,067
- How you doing?
- I'm not a threat, sir.

1137
01:17:57,738 --> 01:17:59,238
- Please don't shoot me.
- All right.

1138
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,739
Please don't shoot me.

1139
01:18:00,741 --> 01:18:02,241
- Don't worry about it.
- I'm complying.

1140
01:18:02,243 --> 01:18:03,876
Relax. Relax.
Put your hands on the hood.

1141
01:18:03,878 --> 01:18:05,544
- My hands are on the vehicle.
- Great.

1142
01:18:05,546 --> 01:18:06,812
You don't have any weapons
on you, do you, man?

1143
01:18:06,814 --> 01:18:08,080
- No, sir, no weapons.
- All right.

1144
01:18:08,082 --> 01:18:09,381
I'm very tense right now.

1145
01:18:09,383 --> 01:18:11,683
Do you have
any drugs in the car?

1146
01:18:11,685 --> 01:18:14,120
No drugs. Not high,
don't have any drugs,

1147
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:15,255
never had any drugs.

1148
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:16,955
Okay. All right.

1149
01:18:16,957 --> 01:18:18,624
You know,
statistically speaking,

1150
01:18:18,626 --> 01:18:21,261
this is the most dangerous
five minutes of my life.

1151
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:23,930
Being pulled over
by law enforcement.

1152
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:26,632
It's okay.
Take it easy. Just breathe.

1153
01:18:26,634 --> 01:18:29,169
You want me to breathe?
You want me to relax?

1154
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:31,670
The chances of me dying
during a routine traffic stop

1155
01:18:31,672 --> 01:18:33,775
are greater than...
I don't even know.

1156
01:18:37,078 --> 01:18:38,778
It's the most dangerous
five minutes of my life, man,

1157
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,412
being pulled over
by law enforcement.

1158
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:43,752
I don't speak Spanish.

1159
01:18:44,586 --> 01:18:46,052
I... I'm no threat.

1160
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:48,320
That's you?

1161
01:18:48,322 --> 01:18:50,425
- Car is clean.
- Okay.

1162
01:18:51,927 --> 01:18:54,329
Sorry to inconvenience you.
Have a good day, sir.

1163
01:18:57,899 --> 01:19:00,500
Thank you
for your service, Officer.

1164
01:19:00,502 --> 01:19:02,003
Thank you, gentlemen.

1165
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:06,341
Have a good day.

1166
01:19:50,386 --> 01:19:52,419
How we looking up there,
anything?

1167
01:19:52,421 --> 01:19:55,023
<i>No.
I got no more, man.</i>

1168
01:19:55,025 --> 01:19:57,094
Yeah, he's not here.

1169
01:19:59,096 --> 01:20:00,696
Hey, Luis.

1170
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:03,999
You don't have him, do you?

1171
01:20:04,001 --> 01:20:05,466
No. Why?

1172
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:08,402
<i>He'll be at the Honest Abe
Motel off Interstate 55.</i>

1173
01:20:08,404 --> 01:20:09,738
Well, that's rather specific.

1174
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:11,639
Tata <i>had to get permission</i>

1175
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:14,276
from his handler
to stop for the night.

1176
01:20:14,278 --> 01:20:16,177
<i>Does that prove my worth?</i>

1177
01:20:16,179 --> 01:20:17,513
We'll see.

1178
01:20:21,151 --> 01:20:23,987
Says he's got a location
on him, Honest Abe Motel.

1179
01:20:26,290 --> 01:20:27,724
Let's check it out.

1180
01:20:36,267 --> 01:20:37,632
It would work a lot better

1181
01:20:37,634 --> 01:20:39,354
if you get that damn phone
out of your hand.

1182
01:20:41,105 --> 01:20:43,507
Did I ask for your
fucking advice, grandpa?

1183
01:20:48,612 --> 01:20:50,814
Past your fucking
bedtime anyway.

1184
01:20:55,452 --> 01:20:57,787
All right, scratch 109.
That's just a young couple

1185
01:20:57,789 --> 01:20:59,789
- with kids and a toddler.
- All right.

1186
01:20:59,791 --> 01:21:00,792
No.

1187
01:21:04,128 --> 01:21:07,699
We got a possible in 203.
Solo male, mid-30s.

1188
01:21:15,341 --> 01:21:17,341
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
What's that, right there?

1189
01:21:17,343 --> 01:21:18,543
What's that, right there?

1190
01:21:19,378 --> 01:21:21,112
You think that's our guy?

1191
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:24,281
Could be.

1192
01:21:24,283 --> 01:21:25,915
How do you wanna play it?

1193
01:21:25,917 --> 01:21:28,584
You wanna get local
police here on a noise call?

1194
01:21:28,586 --> 01:21:30,153
Disorderly conduct?

1195
01:21:30,155 --> 01:21:33,125
No, let's just have homeboy
run into the wrong guy.

1196
01:21:40,099 --> 01:21:42,132
- Everything all right?
- Yeah,

1197
01:21:42,134 --> 01:21:44,567
except I'm trying to avoid
some big asshole

1198
01:21:44,569 --> 01:21:46,136
who's going around here

1199
01:21:46,138 --> 01:21:49,206
banging his cell phone
on the ice machine down there.

1200
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:51,975
I don't know what it is with
you guys and your generation.

1201
01:21:51,977 --> 01:21:53,076
"You guys"?

1202
01:21:53,078 --> 01:21:55,178
Jesus.
Don't you guys live life

1203
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:57,347
for something outside
the goddamn phone?

1204
01:22:18,338 --> 01:22:19,536
The fuck are you doing?

1205
01:22:19,538 --> 01:22:21,372
Fuck, I thought
this was my room.

1206
01:22:21,374 --> 01:22:24,741
Yeah? Well, it's not.
Wake the fuck up, asshole.

1207
01:22:24,743 --> 01:22:26,312
Oh, fuck you, bro.

1208
01:22:28,248 --> 01:22:29,380
What did you say to me?

1209
01:22:29,382 --> 01:22:30,950
I said, "Fuck you."

1210
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:42,193
I don't know
if you've heard the news,

1211
01:22:42,195 --> 01:22:43,795
but it's a felony
to assault a DEA Agent.

1212
01:22:43,797 --> 01:22:45,830
- A what?
- DEA Agent.

1213
01:22:45,832 --> 01:22:47,567
Fuck.

1214
01:22:48,502 --> 01:22:50,635
Yeah, it's less than an ounce.

1215
01:22:50,637 --> 01:22:52,572
Maybe 15 grams.

1216
01:22:54,341 --> 01:22:55,875
See what's in his pickup.

1217
01:23:01,915 --> 01:23:04,615
Ah, fuck. It's not him.

1218
01:23:04,617 --> 01:23:08,487
Maybe there's another Honest
Abe Motel or maybe it's code?

1219
01:23:08,489 --> 01:23:09,921
What do you wanna
do with this guy?

1220
01:23:09,923 --> 01:23:11,390
Uh, call local PD,

1221
01:23:11,392 --> 01:23:13,325
give them the half-ounce
of meth and we keep going.

1222
01:23:13,327 --> 01:23:15,660
Start back up at 6:00 a.m.
Get some rest.

1223
01:23:15,662 --> 01:23:16,897
Come on.

1224
01:23:27,007 --> 01:23:28,575
- Miss?
- Hi.

1225
01:23:28,577 --> 01:23:29,942
Yeah, I'll have
a cup of coffee

1226
01:23:29,944 --> 01:23:31,578
and maybe you'd fill
that thermos for me?

1227
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:33,045
- Sure thing.
- Thank you.

1228
01:23:33,047 --> 01:23:34,581
Can I get the, uh, check,
when you get the chance?

1229
01:23:34,583 --> 01:23:35,850
Absolutely.

1230
01:23:55,337 --> 01:23:56,404
Morning.

1231
01:23:58,173 --> 01:23:59,174
Morning.

1232
01:24:00,774 --> 01:24:03,376
Oh, shit. It's the fifth.

1233
01:24:03,378 --> 01:24:04,379
Hmm.

1234
01:24:05,013 --> 01:24:06,214
Oh, shit.

1235
01:24:07,549 --> 01:24:10,250
I know a lot
about "oh, shits."

1236
01:24:10,252 --> 01:24:14,956
Is that a missed birthday
or what?

1237
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:17,192
Anniversary.

1238
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:21,060
Jesus, I'm an idiot.

1239
01:24:21,062 --> 01:24:22,328
Yeah.

1240
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:24,632
Yeah, I am.

1241
01:24:24,634 --> 01:24:26,166
Sure.

1242
01:24:26,168 --> 01:24:28,536
Yeah, you know, she doesn't
say, "Happy anniversary."

1243
01:24:28,538 --> 01:24:34,140
Just let it sit out there,
waiting for me to remember.

1244
01:24:34,142 --> 01:24:36,709
That was really
something yesterday,

1245
01:24:36,711 --> 01:24:38,978
down at the motel.

1246
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:40,882
The way you took
that guy down.

1247
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:43,883
That was something else,
I tell you.

1248
01:24:43,885 --> 01:24:45,219
Sorry if we caused you
any disturbance.

1249
01:24:45,221 --> 01:24:46,753
No, no. It didn't disturb me.
It was...

1250
01:24:46,755 --> 01:24:48,157
That was unfortunate.

1251
01:24:53,262 --> 01:24:54,762
Well...

1252
01:24:54,764 --> 01:24:56,330
You gotta think
about the family.

1253
01:24:56,332 --> 01:24:57,198
Ah, yeah.

1254
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,800
Each anniversary's important.

1255
01:24:59,802 --> 01:25:01,835
But you've got to think
about it because

1256
01:25:01,837 --> 01:25:03,839
women love that shit,
you know?

1257
01:25:07,944 --> 01:25:10,612
But, you know, I'm the king
of missing anniversaries.

1258
01:25:10,614 --> 01:25:12,094
- Oh, yeah?
- That's the problem. Yes.

1259
01:25:13,417 --> 01:25:15,751
Well, it's the first one
I've missed, so...

1260
01:25:16,386 --> 01:25:17,485
Good luck.

1261
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:20,020
Don't follow my footsteps
and do what I did.

1262
01:25:20,022 --> 01:25:23,123
I put work in front of family.

1263
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:25,360
Family's the most
important thing.

1264
01:25:25,362 --> 01:25:28,263
Work's fine,
if it's in second position.

1265
01:25:28,265 --> 01:25:30,665
But first position
should be family.

1266
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:32,234
I've learned that
the hard way.

1267
01:25:32,236 --> 01:25:34,436
My daughter
won't even speak to me.

1268
01:25:34,438 --> 01:25:36,940
Haven't talked to
in 12 and a half years.

1269
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:38,842
Jesus.

1270
01:25:39,710 --> 01:25:41,245
Twelve and a half years.

1271
01:25:42,713 --> 01:25:44,279
It's like I never...

1272
01:25:44,281 --> 01:25:46,682
Like they were never there,
or something.

1273
01:25:50,622 --> 01:25:52,487
But, uh, anyway,

1274
01:25:52,489 --> 01:25:54,557
- I'd better pay you.
- Oh, thank you.

1275
01:25:54,559 --> 01:25:56,057
Here, you keep that.

1276
01:25:56,059 --> 01:25:58,360
- Thank you.
- That's fine.

1277
01:25:58,362 --> 01:26:00,128
Just what you needed,

1278
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:01,896
some asshole sitting here,
telling you about

1279
01:26:01,898 --> 01:26:03,599
what you should do
in your personal life.

1280
01:26:03,601 --> 01:26:05,233
No, not at all.

1281
01:26:05,235 --> 01:26:08,704
Anyway, I want to
wish you good luck.

1282
01:26:08,706 --> 01:26:10,439
You'll need it.

1283
01:26:10,441 --> 01:26:12,241
And, uh, thank you
for the advice.

1284
01:26:12,243 --> 01:26:14,677
It's good to talk to one
of you guys, once in a while.

1285
01:26:14,679 --> 01:26:16,545
- "You guys"?
- You know.

1286
01:26:16,547 --> 01:26:18,381
- What kind of guys?
- You're just willing to...

1287
01:26:18,383 --> 01:26:20,082
You know,
you've lived so long,

1288
01:26:20,084 --> 01:26:21,918
I think you've probably
lost your filter.

1289
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:28,858
Really. I never realized
I ever had one.

1290
01:26:31,029 --> 01:26:34,032
- All right. Take it easy.
- You, too.

1291
01:26:49,581 --> 01:26:51,417
Excuse me, sir.

1292
01:26:57,323 --> 01:26:58,357
Forgot this.

1293
01:26:59,792 --> 01:27:00,856
Oh.

1294
01:27:00,858 --> 01:27:02,626
Thank you very much.

1295
01:27:02,628 --> 01:27:04,330
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

1296
01:27:25,017 --> 01:27:26,718
Hello, Ginny.

1297
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,518
<i>Grandpa Earl,</i>

1298
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,187
<i>it's Grandma Mary.</i>

1299
01:27:30,189 --> 01:27:34,459
She's sick. Like, sick sick.
We're at the hospital,

1300
01:27:34,461 --> 01:27:36,561
<i>but they're sending her home.</i>

1301
01:27:36,563 --> 01:27:37,961
Oh, well, that's good.

1302
01:27:37,963 --> 01:27:39,831
That's good
that they're sending her home.

1303
01:27:39,833 --> 01:27:41,998
No, it's bad.

1304
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,968
They did all these
tests and scan shit,

1305
01:27:44,970 --> 01:27:46,103
but it doesn't matter.

1306
01:27:46,105 --> 01:27:47,572
They said she should've...

1307
01:27:47,574 --> 01:27:49,642
She should've come in,
like, a year ago.

1308
01:27:51,877 --> 01:27:53,678
<i>Grandpa Earl, are you there?</i>

1309
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:55,079
Yeah.

1310
01:27:55,081 --> 01:27:57,715
<i>You have to come,
like, right now.</i>

1311
01:27:57,717 --> 01:27:59,517
Ginny, I can't.

1312
01:27:59,519 --> 01:28:02,320
What? Why?

1313
01:28:02,322 --> 01:28:04,956
<i>They said it could be
any day now.</i>

1314
01:28:04,958 --> 01:28:07,392
I've got this schedule.
It's really tight.

1315
01:28:08,763 --> 01:28:09,994
<i>I've just got so many things.
I can't do it.</i>

1316
01:28:09,996 --> 01:28:12,096
Yeah, right.

1317
01:28:12,098 --> 01:28:13,431
<i>I took shit for years,</i>

1318
01:28:13,433 --> 01:28:16,033
sticking up for you.
What an idiot!

1319
01:28:16,035 --> 01:28:18,639
It turns out,
I was wrong the whole time.

1320
01:28:19,939 --> 01:28:22,073
Ginny...

1321
01:28:22,075 --> 01:28:25,009
I'm sorry.
If I could drop everything

1322
01:28:25,011 --> 01:28:28,148
<i>and go do it, I would.
But I'm sorry...</i>

1323
01:29:02,183 --> 01:29:05,117
- You came?
- Yeah.

1324
01:29:05,119 --> 01:29:07,252
Where's your mom?

1325
01:29:07,254 --> 01:29:09,622
She's in her bedroom.

1326
01:29:09,624 --> 01:29:11,526
Okay. I'm gonna go in.

1327
01:29:23,438 --> 01:29:24,706
Hello, Mary.

1328
01:29:28,610 --> 01:29:30,045
Earl,

1329
01:29:30,846 --> 01:29:32,412
what do you want?

1330
01:29:32,414 --> 01:29:35,415
You're not in the will
or anything.

1331
01:29:35,417 --> 01:29:36,418
Oh.

1332
01:29:39,521 --> 01:29:41,623
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1333
01:29:43,024 --> 01:29:46,059
I didn't mean to say that.

1334
01:29:46,061 --> 01:29:48,430
I'm just scared, is all.

1335
01:29:48,997 --> 01:29:50,598
Yeah.

1336
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:53,099
Well, the only person
who wants to live to 100

1337
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:55,705
is a 99-year-old, anyway.

1338
01:29:56,772 --> 01:29:58,641
I'm sorry, Mary.

1339
01:30:01,009 --> 01:30:03,245
I'm... I'm sorry
for everything.

1340
01:30:06,549 --> 01:30:09,318
You lived
to get back out there.

1341
01:30:10,686 --> 01:30:13,921
All the conventions

1342
01:30:13,923 --> 01:30:19,493
and the socializing and being
the center of attention.

1343
01:30:19,495 --> 01:30:24,300
They got the fun,
wonderful man that you are.

1344
01:30:25,234 --> 01:30:26,667
And we got the Earl

1345
01:30:26,669 --> 01:30:29,705
who just couldn't wait
to get back out there.

1346
01:30:31,574 --> 01:30:32,743
Yeah.

1347
01:30:33,810 --> 01:30:35,109
Well, you're right.

1348
01:30:35,111 --> 01:30:36,645
I thought it was
more important

1349
01:30:36,647 --> 01:30:39,650
to be somebody out there

1350
01:30:41,317 --> 01:30:44,655
than the damn failure I was
here at my own home.

1351
01:30:50,092 --> 01:30:51,628
Anyway, for what it's worth,

1352
01:30:53,195 --> 01:30:54,765
I'm here now.

1353
01:30:57,734 --> 01:30:59,536
I don't know why,

1354
01:31:01,004 --> 01:31:02,773
but for some reason,

1355
01:31:05,342 --> 01:31:07,778
I'm so glad you're here.

1356
01:31:14,751 --> 01:31:15,853
Yeah.

1357
01:31:16,854 --> 01:31:18,355
Thank you.

1358
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:37,375
No answer, again.

1359
01:31:38,241 --> 01:31:41,176
No good, Earl. No good.

1360
01:31:41,178 --> 01:31:44,248
We're going to end
that fucking <i>Tata.</i>

1361
01:31:50,288 --> 01:31:52,657
Was supposed to be here
a day ago.

1362
01:31:53,992 --> 01:31:55,893
Maybe the kid lied.

1363
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:02,600
Maybe.

1364
01:32:05,004 --> 01:32:08,471
Hang on, there's
a call coming from inside.

1365
01:32:08,473 --> 01:32:10,575
They don't know
where he is either.

1366
01:32:11,242 --> 01:32:12,778
They sound pissed.

1367
01:32:14,345 --> 01:32:16,314
Say when they find him,

1368
01:32:17,082 --> 01:32:18,684
they're gonna kill him.

1369
01:32:31,195 --> 01:32:32,429
Mmm.

1370
01:32:37,102 --> 01:32:38,904
- You all right?
- Mmm-hmm.

1371
01:32:39,905 --> 01:32:42,341
Mmm. Good.

1372
01:32:45,078 --> 01:32:47,513
Earl.

1373
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,882
Tell me something?

1374
01:32:50,884 --> 01:32:52,384
Yeah, anything.

1375
01:32:54,286 --> 01:32:57,256
How did you come into
all that money?

1376
01:33:01,861 --> 01:33:03,594
Well, I just...

1377
01:33:03,596 --> 01:33:05,596
Well, I'm not gonna
lie to you.

1378
01:33:05,598 --> 01:33:07,832
I'm a high-end gigolo.

1379
01:33:12,072 --> 01:33:14,105
- Bounty hunter?
- Come on.

1380
01:33:14,107 --> 01:33:15,707
Seriously, come on.

1381
01:33:15,709 --> 01:33:17,608
- All right, seriously.
- Mmm-hmm.

1382
01:33:17,610 --> 01:33:20,945
I've become a drug mule
for the cartel.

1383
01:33:20,947 --> 01:33:24,348
And I've got
305 kilos of cocaine

1384
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:26,619
sitting right in the back
of my truck out there.

1385
01:33:32,258 --> 01:33:34,861
You're never gonna tell me.

1386
01:33:37,330 --> 01:33:41,532
Well, whatever you did,

1387
01:33:41,534 --> 01:33:45,672
you didn't have to get rich
for us to want you around.

1388
01:33:49,309 --> 01:33:50,678
Yeah.

1389
01:34:07,328 --> 01:34:09,997
I see you finally
came out here.

1390
01:34:15,603 --> 01:34:18,904
See, she didn't completely
throw you away.

1391
01:34:18,906 --> 01:34:20,341
No.

1392
01:34:22,409 --> 01:34:25,344
I failed you, Iris.

1393
01:34:25,346 --> 01:34:30,516
I was a terrible father,
terrible husband.

1394
01:34:30,518 --> 01:34:32,819
I just blew it, that's all.

1395
01:34:32,821 --> 01:34:34,488
Blew my chance.

1396
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:40,794
I don't think so.

1397
01:34:40,796 --> 01:34:43,129
I think you're just
a late bloomer.

1398
01:34:45,167 --> 01:34:46,868
Yeah.

1399
01:34:51,907 --> 01:34:53,139
They're shitting bricks.

1400
01:34:53,141 --> 01:34:55,341
They haven't heard from him
in over a week.

1401
01:34:55,343 --> 01:34:57,877
And it's like 12 mil
worth of coke,

1402
01:34:57,879 --> 01:35:00,816
so, I mean, they got people
swarming the highways.

1403
01:35:01,883 --> 01:35:03,318
Good.

1404
01:35:07,422 --> 01:35:09,056
We have new information
on <i>Tata.</i>

1405
01:35:09,058 --> 01:35:11,691
I have new information,
from my boss.

1406
01:35:11,693 --> 01:35:13,928
- It's time to wrap this up.
- Come on, we can get this guy.

1407
01:35:13,930 --> 01:35:16,864
- Oh, it's been months, Colin.
- So what's a couple more days?

1408
01:35:16,866 --> 01:35:18,631
Look, we don't even know
if the guy is still out there.

1409
01:35:18,633 --> 01:35:20,533
You've been allotted
as much time and resources

1410
01:35:20,535 --> 01:35:22,903
as we can give to anyone.

1411
01:35:22,905 --> 01:35:24,740
You did good work.

1412
01:35:29,078 --> 01:35:31,846
If you had a few more days
while we finalize

1413
01:35:31,848 --> 01:35:33,681
the warrants,
what's your plan?

1414
01:35:33,683 --> 01:35:35,149
Follow his followers.

1415
01:35:35,151 --> 01:35:37,184
We tapped the phones
of a couple cartel guys

1416
01:35:37,186 --> 01:35:38,487
that are also looking for him.

1417
01:35:39,288 --> 01:35:41,255
Okay, do it.

1418
01:35:41,257 --> 01:35:42,558
Thank you.

1419
01:36:19,229 --> 01:36:21,465
What? You okay?

1420
01:36:24,134 --> 01:36:25,836
It's all right.

1421
01:36:32,676 --> 01:36:37,712
You were the love of my life

1422
01:36:37,714 --> 01:36:41,018
and the pain of my life.

1423
01:36:43,787 --> 01:36:48,692
I need you to know,

1424
01:36:51,329 --> 01:36:54,496
it's all the world to me

1425
01:36:54,498 --> 01:36:56,768
that you're here.

1426
01:37:05,475 --> 01:37:07,078
I love you, Mary.

1427
01:37:10,548 --> 01:37:13,518
More today than yesterday?

1428
01:37:17,622 --> 01:37:19,857
But not as much as tomorrow.

1429
01:37:22,927 --> 01:37:25,130
Oh. Oh.

1430
01:37:43,514 --> 01:37:45,349
I knew Mary
well enough to know

1431
01:37:45,351 --> 01:37:47,451
that there was
no better friend,

1432
01:37:47,453 --> 01:37:49,686
no better mother,
no better mentor.

1433
01:37:49,688 --> 01:37:52,057
No better listener
to those in need.

1434
01:37:53,225 --> 01:37:54,925
The light that
she carried through

1435
01:37:54,927 --> 01:37:57,060
in her soul and her spirit

1436
01:37:57,062 --> 01:37:59,563
is something that
we should carry on

1437
01:37:59,565 --> 01:38:01,331
in our own daily lives.

1438
01:38:01,333 --> 01:38:03,468
The optimism, the hopefulness,

1439
01:38:03,470 --> 01:38:06,970
even at the end of her days.

1440
01:38:06,972 --> 01:38:09,273
"Everything works out
better than expected,"

1441
01:38:09,275 --> 01:38:10,707
she always used to say.

1442
01:38:10,709 --> 01:38:12,109
We will miss her,

1443
01:38:12,111 --> 01:38:15,181
but she would not
want us to mourn today.

1444
01:38:19,785 --> 01:38:21,419
- Thank you, sir.
- Very sorry.

1445
01:38:21,421 --> 01:38:22,819
- Thank you very much.
- Yes, sir.

1446
01:38:22,821 --> 01:38:24,355
- Thank you.
- Very, very sorry.

1447
01:38:24,357 --> 01:38:25,557
Yeah.

1448
01:38:30,130 --> 01:38:31,731
Hey, Dad.

1449
01:38:33,233 --> 01:38:35,833
The flowers
were really lovely.

1450
01:38:35,835 --> 01:38:39,337
Oh, well, thank you, dear.
Glad you liked them.

1451
01:38:39,339 --> 01:38:40,705
We'd, uh...

1452
01:38:40,707 --> 01:38:43,143
We'd like to invite you
to Thanksgiving.

1453
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:45,912
- Really?
- Yeah.

1454
01:38:48,381 --> 01:38:50,214
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1455
01:38:50,216 --> 01:38:51,217
Good.

1456
01:39:00,827 --> 01:39:02,667
That's him right there.
That's him right there.

1457
01:39:16,877 --> 01:39:18,279
Where you been, Earl?

1458
01:39:19,747 --> 01:39:21,513
I've been unavailable.

1459
01:39:25,152 --> 01:39:27,619
Why you making us
have to do this, hmm?

1460
01:39:27,621 --> 01:39:29,156
You were warned, <i>viejo.</i>

1461
01:39:31,258 --> 01:39:33,794
"Celebrating the life
of Mary Stone."

1462
01:39:34,695 --> 01:39:36,795
Who the fuck is Mary Stone?

1463
01:39:36,797 --> 01:39:38,766
- Huh?
- That's my wife. She passed.

1464
01:39:43,003 --> 01:39:45,572
Yeah. I know I was warned.

1465
01:39:45,574 --> 01:39:48,006
I went AWOL anyway so...

1466
01:39:48,008 --> 01:39:50,477
I won't feel
no ill will if you...

1467
01:39:50,479 --> 01:39:52,412
Whatever goes on here.

1468
01:39:52,414 --> 01:39:54,114
Just go ahead.

1469
01:39:54,116 --> 01:39:57,119
Do the fucking...
Do what you have to do.

1470
01:40:03,058 --> 01:40:05,058
<i>Gustavo, we found him.</i>

1471
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:07,093
Wait.
They're talking about <i>Tata.</i>

1472
01:40:07,095 --> 01:40:08,561
<i>He was at a funeral.</i>

1473
01:40:08,563 --> 01:40:10,096
<i>His wife was dying of cancer.</i>

1474
01:40:10,098 --> 01:40:11,664
Pero <i>now</i>
<i>he's finishing the run.</i>

1475
01:40:11,666 --> 01:40:13,666
Sounds like they're with him.

1476
01:40:13,668 --> 01:40:15,628
<i>He was warned.</i>

1477
01:40:17,672 --> 01:40:19,074
<i>I don't care.</i>

1478
01:40:22,210 --> 01:40:23,776
<i>Si, si, si.</i>

1479
01:40:23,778 --> 01:40:25,446
They're gonna kill him.

1480
01:40:25,448 --> 01:40:26,813
<i>Gustavo,
he's the best mule we have.</i>

1481
01:40:26,815 --> 01:40:28,047
I need a lock on a GPS now.

1482
01:40:28,049 --> 01:40:29,517
And get the chopper
in the air.

1483
01:40:29,519 --> 01:40:31,084
<i>Okay.
Let him finish his drop.</i>

1484
01:40:31,086 --> 01:40:33,521
<i>If he fails, it's your head.</i>

1485
01:40:35,957 --> 01:40:37,558
<i>Get it done.</i>

1486
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:38,894
Okay.

1487
01:40:41,696 --> 01:40:44,231
<i>We have
a location on that GPS track.</i>

1488
01:40:44,233 --> 01:40:48,304
<i>Illinois, a quarter mile east
off Interstate 55, exit 224.</i>

1489
01:40:49,372 --> 01:40:50,905
All right, here we go.

1490
01:41:30,047 --> 01:41:32,614
<i>Suspect is moving northbound.</i>

1491
01:41:32,616 --> 01:41:34,748
Unit one, go ahead and block
all northbound traffic.

1492
01:41:34,750 --> 01:41:36,952
Units two and three,
box him in once we're in position.

1493
01:41:36,954 --> 01:41:38,653
<i>- Roger that.</i>
- All right, here we go.

1494
01:41:38,655 --> 01:41:40,457
It all comes down right here.

1495
01:42:18,962 --> 01:42:20,429
All right, here we go.

1496
01:42:20,431 --> 01:42:22,965
<i>Charlie 223,
helo 17 on top.</i>

1497
01:42:22,967 --> 01:42:24,235
<i>Air team,
we have a visual.</i>

1498
01:42:30,975 --> 01:42:32,877
Be smart. Slow down.

1499
01:42:37,650 --> 01:42:38,850
All right.

1500
01:42:40,552 --> 01:42:42,084
Let's go.

1501
01:42:42,086 --> 01:42:44,053
Step out of the vehicle
with your hands up!

1502
01:42:44,055 --> 01:42:45,821
Get out of the car!

1503
01:42:45,823 --> 01:42:47,223
Driver, step out
of the vehicle.

1504
01:42:47,225 --> 01:42:48,525
Put your hands in the air!

1505
01:42:48,527 --> 01:42:50,159
Get out
of the fucking vehicle now!

1506
01:42:50,161 --> 01:42:51,528
Get out of the car!

1507
01:42:51,530 --> 01:42:53,399
Get out of the car!

1508
01:43:00,038 --> 01:43:01,171
Step out of the vehicle!

1509
01:43:01,173 --> 01:43:03,573
Put your hands
above your head!

1510
01:43:03,575 --> 01:43:06,176
Keep your hands in the air!
Step away from the vehicle!

1511
01:43:06,178 --> 01:43:08,211
Let me see your hands!

1512
01:43:08,213 --> 01:43:09,613
Put your hands in the air!

1513
01:43:09,615 --> 01:43:11,114
- Your hands!
- Step away from the vehicle!

1514
01:43:11,116 --> 01:43:12,815
Turn around,
face the other way!

1515
01:43:12,817 --> 01:43:14,217
- Turn around!
- Turn around

1516
01:43:14,219 --> 01:43:16,386
- and face the other way!
- Turn around!

1517
01:43:16,388 --> 01:43:18,555
Put your hands
behind your head

1518
01:43:18,557 --> 01:43:21,124
and interlace your fingers.

1519
01:43:21,126 --> 01:43:22,959
Now I want you to take
steps back towards me

1520
01:43:22,961 --> 01:43:24,563
to the sound of my voice.

1521
01:43:25,531 --> 01:43:26,965
There you go.

1522
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:30,102
That's it, keep coming.

1523
01:43:31,970 --> 01:43:33,205
Here we go.

1524
01:43:34,474 --> 01:43:35,841
That's it.

1525
01:43:52,858 --> 01:43:54,828
You.

1526
01:43:56,296 --> 01:43:57,430
Yeah.

1527
01:44:00,166 --> 01:44:01,432
Do you need
more staties here?

1528
01:44:01,434 --> 01:44:02,467
No, no, no.

1529
01:44:02,469 --> 01:44:03,701
We're just gonna talk.

1530
01:44:03,703 --> 01:44:04,904
Okay. All right.

1531
01:44:22,155 --> 01:44:23,657
What happened to your face?

1532
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:27,626
Nothing.

1533
01:44:27,628 --> 01:44:30,462
I just got what I damn
well deserved, is all.

1534
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:31,898
And the suit?

1535
01:44:33,099 --> 01:44:35,032
Went to a funeral.

1536
01:44:35,034 --> 01:44:36,869
My ex-wife's funeral.

1537
01:44:36,871 --> 01:44:38,071
I'm sorry.

1538
01:44:39,407 --> 01:44:44,676
Lucky, actually. I got to
spend some time with her.

1539
01:44:44,678 --> 01:44:47,880
She let me in
and my whole family let me in.

1540
01:44:47,882 --> 01:44:50,115
My daughter, everybody.

1541
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:52,651
Is this the daughter
that wouldn't talk to you?

1542
01:44:52,653 --> 01:44:54,286
Yeah.

1543
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:56,121
That's right.
You remember that, huh?

1544
01:44:56,123 --> 01:44:57,458
- I do.
- Huh.

1545
01:44:59,627 --> 01:45:01,059
Well...

1546
01:45:01,061 --> 01:45:02,896
Am I the guy who's responsible

1547
01:45:02,898 --> 01:45:05,765
for you missing
your anniversary?

1548
01:45:08,035 --> 01:45:09,435
You know, it's funny.

1549
01:45:09,437 --> 01:45:11,638
After all this work
and the time away,

1550
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:14,241
you, of all people,
were right.

1551
01:45:16,344 --> 01:45:19,514
I ain't been right
about much in life.

1552
01:45:23,518 --> 01:45:26,352
Well, you made things
straight with your family.

1553
01:45:26,354 --> 01:45:27,355
Yeah.

1554
01:45:27,988 --> 01:45:29,322
I'm glad for you.

1555
01:45:29,324 --> 01:45:32,158
That's the thing.
You just remember that.

1556
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:34,729
You remember that
with your family.

1557
01:45:36,031 --> 01:45:38,400
You don't need
all that other shit.

1558
01:45:39,801 --> 01:45:41,470
I'll try to.

1559
01:45:44,673 --> 01:45:47,140
You take care
of yourself, okay?

1560
01:45:47,142 --> 01:45:49,377
- You, too.
- Yeah.

1561
01:45:50,078 --> 01:45:51,647
Hang in there.

1562
01:46:19,575 --> 01:46:21,876
Earl Stone is a man
who served his country,

1563
01:46:21,878 --> 01:46:23,477
fought for our freedom,

1564
01:46:23,479 --> 01:46:25,715
and now faces
the loss of his own.

1565
01:46:29,887 --> 01:46:31,920
Murdering cartel thugs

1566
01:46:31,922 --> 01:46:35,089
who not only took advantage
of his good nature,

1567
01:46:35,091 --> 01:46:36,658
but also his advanced age,

1568
01:46:36,660 --> 01:46:38,492
his vulnerability.
Your Honor...

1569
01:46:38,494 --> 01:46:39,630
Guilty.

1570
01:46:41,097 --> 01:46:42,298
Earl.

1571
01:46:44,835 --> 01:46:46,267
Earl.

1572
01:46:46,269 --> 01:46:48,472
Mr. Stone, you should
talk to your attorney.

1573
01:46:49,238 --> 01:46:51,038
Earl, don't do this.

1574
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:53,443
- Earl...
- Guilty, Your Honor.

1575
01:46:54,011 --> 01:46:55,577
I did it.

1576
01:46:55,579 --> 01:46:59,416
Mr. Stone, are you pleading
guilty on all charges?

1577
01:47:00,884 --> 01:47:02,084
Yes.

1578
01:47:04,053 --> 01:47:06,688
Bailiff.
Take him into custody.

1579
01:47:06,690 --> 01:47:10,460
Mr. Stone, you are remanded
into federal prison.

1580
01:47:14,064 --> 01:47:15,766
You did a good job.

1581
01:47:19,169 --> 01:47:21,938
We'll come visit you
every chance we can.

1582
01:47:21,940 --> 01:47:23,240
Thanks.

1583
01:47:26,109 --> 01:47:28,010
Mike and I will
look after the farm.

1584
01:47:28,012 --> 01:47:29,379
Don't you worry, Grandpa.

1585
01:47:30,615 --> 01:47:32,149
I know you will.

1586
01:47:35,285 --> 01:47:38,588
It's just time, is all.

1587
01:47:38,590 --> 01:47:44,327
I could buy anything,
but I couldn't buy time.

1588
01:47:44,329 --> 01:47:46,831
It's okay. We love you.

1589
01:47:52,403 --> 01:47:54,037
All right. Thank you.

1590
01:47:54,039 --> 01:47:56,841
At least we'll always know
where you are.

1591
01:47:58,978 --> 01:48:01,312
Court is adjourned.

1592
01:48:11,155 --> 01:48:14,359
- Good work, Special Agent.
- Thank you, sir.

1593
01:50:18,959 --> 01:50:23,959
