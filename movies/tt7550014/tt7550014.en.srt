00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,458
Every day, it was the same.

4
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:49,167
Is there anyone…

5
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:56,333
anyone in my old life
who would still talk to me?

6
00:00:57,417 --> 00:01:00,583
Wouldn't hang up the phone
when I ask for money?

7
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,083
And as soon as I got that money,
it was gone.

8
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:05,958
And then I needed more.

9
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:09,708
Like that guy in the story.

10
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,250
That guy who keeps pushing
the rock up the hill,

11
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:17,708
and every time he gets to the top,
it rolls straight back down.

12
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,583
Every day, I pushed that rock up the hill,

13
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:26,500
and every day,
it rolled right back down to the bottom.

14
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,333
But I'm here now,

15
00:01:30,417 --> 00:01:33,500
and I know that every day can be
a fresh start if you want it to.

16
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:37,250
Amen, Jade.

17
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,333
Thank you.

18
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:39,458
Good job.

19
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:40,542
Thank you.

20
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,000
Darby.

21
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:55,250
Darby, it's your turn.

22
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,250
Um, okay.

23
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:04,042
Darby, 11 days.

24
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:11,292
The whole pushing a rock up the hill thing
is very moving.

25
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:17,500
I remember the first time I heard you
tell that story at the recovery center.

26
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:19,958
What was that, like, two years ago?

27
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:21,167
Fuck you.

28
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,042
Honestly, what are we doing here?

29
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:33,667
Sobriety is a battle. It's a daily battle.

30
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,250
I know, I've tried. Seven times.

31
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,792
The Sobriety Center,
Way Forward Recovery Clinic,

32
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,125
A Better Tomorrow.

33
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,250
NA.

34
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,375
But, hey, it's rehab or jail.

35
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,833
Darby, I've sat where you're sitting.

36
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:56,583
I told myself the same thing,
"Rehab doesn't work."

37
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:57,958
- But...
- Excuse me.

38
00:02:58,042 --> 00:03:00,500
- Darby, phone for you.
- Just a minute, Mike.

39
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,708
They said it's urgent.

40
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,208
Carry on.

41
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:16,792
Hello.

42
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:18,542
<i>It's Joe.</i>

43
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:22,708
<i>Your mom's in the Lakeview Hospital.
She had a brain aneurysm.</i>

44
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:25,125
<i>Doc-Doctor says there's a lot
of bleeding in her brain,</i>

45
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,875
<i>so they're gonna operate tonight.</i>

46
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,208
<i>I know you haven't talked to anyone
since you left,</i>

47
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:31,917
<i>but you should call your sister.</i>

48
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:34,583
<i>Devon's at the hospital now.</i>

49
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:37,750
<i>I'll give you her number.</i>

50
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:42,333
- <i>801-555-0148</i>...
- Wait, can you... Wait.

51
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:46,542
<i>801-555-0148.</i>

52
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,750
- <i>You got that?</i>
- Yeah.

53
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,917
<i>Look, I'm not sure
I should even be calling you</i>

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,625
<i>but I just thought you oughta know.</i>

55
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,167
- <i>Joe, we need you.</i>
- <i>I'm sorry. I gotta go.</i>

56
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,667
<i>Things are crazy here right now.
You should call Devon.</i>

57
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah. I'm, um…

58
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,875
- <i>Promise me you'll call her.</i>
- Yeah, I'm going to now.

59
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,333
<i>Okay, I'll talk to you later.</i>

60
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:07,000
- Okay, bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

61
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,542
You okay?

62
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,875
- Darby?
- Yeah.

63
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,750
Yeah, my mom...

64
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,250
I need to make a call.

65
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,500
No outgoing calls. You know the rules.

66
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,792
My mom is in the hospital.
I have to call my sister.

67
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,625
Last week you said
your mom was in a car accident.

68
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,208
Last week I was in detox.
Who knows what the fuck I was saying?

69
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:34,458
This is a big thing, Darby.
I have to call Dr. Fletcher.

70
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:35,875
What's going on?

71
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,958
My mom is in the hospital.
He won't let me make a call.

72
00:04:39,042 --> 00:04:41,917
Darby, you know the rules.
I have to speak with Dr. Fletcher.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,083
He's your doctor.

74
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,583
Call him.

75
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,583
<i>Ben Fletcher. Leave a message.</i>

76
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:00,458
- Tell him that it's urgent.
- Hey, Dr. Fletcher.

77
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:04,083
It's Mike from the Center. Can you give me
a call when you get this message?

78
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:06,042
Tell him that it's urgent.

79
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,125
- It's Friday afternoon. They're...
- Go fuck your Friday afternoon.

80
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:13,042
Darby.

81
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:24,958
Jade.

82
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:28,875
Jade.

83
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,167
- What?
- I need to borrow your phone.

84
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,250
I don't have a phone.

85
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,583
Sarah told me
that you let her call her kids yesterday.

86
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:49,042
If you don't give it to me, I'm gonna tell
Dr. Bill his perfect patient has a phone.

87
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,708
And then no one gets to make calls.

88
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:56,333
I'm doing this program at the Center here.

89
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,667
It's actually going really well.

90
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,750
I just...

91
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:08,167
You need to call them
and tell them what's going on,

92
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,667
so I can come and see Mom.

93
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:14,375
<i>That's not a good idea.
You should stay where you are.</i>

94
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,875
You call them. It'll be fine.

95
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,583
<i>Jesus, Darby.
I'm not bailing you out of rehab.</i>

96
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:23,000
<i>I've got enough problems
with Mom in the hospital.</i>

97
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:26,625
<i>Fuck. I told Joe not to look for you.</i>

98
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,292
<i>No one has time
for your bullshit right now.</i>

99
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,292
- <i>Mom could die.</i>
- Devon.

100
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,125
<i>Don't call me back.</i>

101
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,208
Come on.

102
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:35,250
Hey, Mikey,
can you give me a hand with Susan?

103
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,708
What's the problem?

104
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,208
She said she had a nightmare.

105
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,583
Now she won't get back in bed.
Roaming the halls.

106
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,417
Okay, hold on.

107
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,083
Keys, keys.

108
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,250
One day at a time, huh, Mikey?

109
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,167
<i>This is Devon. Leave a message.</i>

110
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,167
It's me.
I'll be in Salt Lake by morning.

111
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:03,917
Call me back, Devon.
I need to know how Mom is.

112
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,917
<i>Weather alert.
Incident ahead. Expect delays.</i>

113
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:29,083
<i>Exit right towards Route 50.</i>

114
00:09:50,292 --> 00:09:52,083
<i>This is Devon. Leave...</i>

115
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:29,542
Oh, God! Someone, please...
Please help me!

116
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:06,958
You okay, ma'am?

117
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:08,583
I... I just...

118
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,042
I pulled over for a break.
I think I must've fallen asleep.

119
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,000
Not the best place for a nap.

120
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:17,375
Yeah, I know.

121
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:19,833
I'll get... I'll get going.

122
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:21,625
No, you won't.

123
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,542
The road's closed.
Interstate's closed too.

124
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:26,667
This storm's just getting started.

125
00:12:28,292 --> 00:12:31,333
My mom is in the hospital.
I have to get to Salt Lake City.

126
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,250
No one's getting through
until the storm passes.

127
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:35,917
You got two choices.

128
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,750
You can either head back down,

129
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,750
or I opened up the Visitors' Center
for some folks.

130
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:43,000
It's a few hundred yards up the road.
You can wait it out there.

131
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:48,208
Ma'am, you need to decide now.

132
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:51,292
Uh…

133
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'll... I'll go to the Visitors' Center.

134
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,583
And when you get there, you stop.

135
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:59,708
Promise me you won't drive on.
You won't get through.

136
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:02,542
I don't wanna find your car
under a snowbank in the morning, okay?

137
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,375
Okay.

138
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,125
Shut the door, hon.
You're letting in the cold.

139
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:26,958
Bathroom?

140
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,542
Back around the map.

141
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,958
I told you we should have
stayed on the interstate.

142
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:37,458
You heard what that cop said.
We can always head back out the mountain.

143
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:39,583
I can't believe…

144
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:42,583
Anyway, you go back down,
you'll change your mind.

145
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,167
Anybody in there?

146
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,167
Do you have the Wi-Fi?

147
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,000
Excuse me.

148
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,542
Mm-mmm. No, there's no Wi-Fi.

149
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,625
Storm's on top of us now.

150
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,375
Well?

151
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,750
I got one bar by the tree
for about ten seconds.

152
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Which tree?

153
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,042
Muir Tree.
The tree in the middle of the lot.

154
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,125
I'm here. I'm here.

155
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:42,167
Fuck.

156
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:48,375
I'm gonna get you out, okay?
I promise, okay?

157
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,583
Come on, come on.

158
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,000
Shit.

159
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,083
Leaving already?

160
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,583
No, I-I forgot something in my car.

161
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:12,708
Yeah, you were out here so long,
I thought maybe you got some service.

162
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:13,875
No, nothing.

163
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:43,958
Hey.

164
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:45,958
Hey, are you okay?

165
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,250
Yeah.

166
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,375
Why don't you come on over here
and sit down?

167
00:21:55,125 --> 00:22:00,125
Make yourself comfortable.
We are here till the storm clears.

168
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,167
And then some.

169
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,833
So what's your name?

170
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:05,333
Darby.

171
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:07,042
I'm Sandi.

172
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,250
Ed.

173
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,083
And what's your name, son?

174
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,708
What's your name?

175
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:27,833
Lars.

176
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:35,167
Was I snoring?

177
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,125
I was snoring, wasn't I? Yeah.

178
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,292
Place sure filled up.

179
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:46,250
And what about you?
What's your name?

180
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,042
Oh. I'm Ash.

181
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:52,708
Sandi, Ed, Darby and Lars.

182
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:53,917
Anybody wanna play?

183
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:56,292
You can't wait?

184
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,417
We're stuck here.

185
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:01,333
Seven Card Stud. Quarter a hand?

186
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:03,375
I don't gamble.

187
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:04,667
That's smart.

188
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,333
What about you, Ash?

189
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:10,458
Oh, I'm not too good at poker.

190
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:11,833
Perfect.

191
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:15,167
Wanna play?

192
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:17,708
Got a lot of time.

193
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:20,167
I got a game everyone could play.

194
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:22,042
What's that?

195
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,375
Bullshit.

196
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:25,958
Bullshit?

197
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:27,667
Yeah, Bullshit.

198
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:30,000
It's the best game.

199
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:34,292
Okay. I'll try anything once.

200
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,250
- Really?
- Yeah, come on.

201
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,542
Okay.

202
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:57,833
- Sandi. You in?
- Fine.

203
00:23:57,917 --> 00:24:00,250
But aren't you scared you're gonna lose?

204
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,500
You know I can
see right through your bullshit.

205
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:05,792
- Oh!
- Your game, your deal, Mr. Bullshit.

206
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:07,125
How do we play this thing?

207
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:09,583
Well, it's pretty simple.

208
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:13,417
I divide the cards evenly
between everyone,

209
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,583
then the person to the left of the dealer
puts a card facedown on the table.

210
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,875
They say what it is, but none of us
can see it 'cause it's facedown.

211
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:24,458
The next person's gotta put a card
down on top of that,

212
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:28,208
that's either the same value,
one higher or one lower.

213
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:29,667
Suits don't matter.

214
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,958
So, if I put down a two, the next person's
gotta put down a two, a three or an ace.

215
00:24:34,042 --> 00:24:36,167
And all the cards are always facedown,

216
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,667
so we either gotta
take each other's word for it,

217
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,375
or if you think someone's lying,

218
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:42,792
you call, "Bullshit!"

219
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:45,792
Then what?

220
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:47,750
That depends.

221
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:51,333
Um, if you call bullshit, the person's
gotta show the card they put down.

222
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:54,000
If they were lying, they gotta pick up
all the cards on the table.

223
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:55,292
But if they weren't lying,

224
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:58,083
the person who called bullshit
has to pick up all the cards.

225
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:01,708
First person
to get rid of all their cards wins.

226
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:06,375
Ten cards each leaves two in the middle.
Facedown.

227
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:08,750
Sure we don't wanna make this interesting?

228
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:11,750
Well, it's a friendly game.
Let's keep it that way.

229
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,500
Left of the dealer goes first.

230
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:19,917
Jack. So, where's everyone from?

231
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:22,958
Jack.

232
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:26,750
Um, Lower Haight.
It's right next to San Fran.

233
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,500
San Jose. Jack.

234
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:29,875
Jack.

235
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:31,958
Oh, four in a row to start a game?

236
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:35,500
- They got a name for that?
- Yeah, bullshitter's row.

237
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:36,875
That's not a thing.

238
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,375
Queen.

239
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,667
- Jack.
- Bullshit! Jacks are out.

240
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,958
- Ooh!
- Hmm.

241
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:52,292
If you had two Jacks,
you should've put them both down.

242
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:54,333
I just did.

243
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:55,625
But the same time.

244
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:57,208
Hmm. Is that the rule?

245
00:25:57,292 --> 00:25:58,833
No, doesn't...

246
00:25:58,917 --> 00:26:01,333
No, you don't... I guess you don't have to.

247
00:26:03,292 --> 00:26:04,500
It's your turn.

248
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:08,708
Six.

249
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,083
- Seven.
- Two eights.

250
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:16,708
So, Lars, you didn't say where...
Where are you from?

251
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:18,917
Battle Mountain.

252
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:20,458
Where is that?

253
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,167
Two nines.

254
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,125
- Bullshit.
- Goddamn it.

255
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,167
You cleared your throat.

256
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,083
Everybody's got a tell.

257
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:31,542
Trick is, play the man, not the hand.

258
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,250
Everybody's got a tell, huh? What's yours?

259
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:37,708
You're gonna have to
figure that one out for yourself.

260
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:43,917
Two sixes.

261
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,875
Where you from?

262
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:48,875
Sacramento.

263
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:52,417
Five. So you're a big poker guy, huh?

264
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,042
Four. Guilty. Picked it up in the service.

265
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:56,125
Two fives.

266
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,417
- Four.
- You're in the army?

267
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:01,583
Marines. 22nd MEU.

268
00:27:02,417 --> 00:27:03,542
My dad was a marine.

269
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:05,958
Yeah? Where'd he serve?

270
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,958
Uh, Third Battalion, First Marines.

271
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:10,667
Fallujah?

272
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,625
Yeah.

273
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:14,833
Some hard fighting.

274
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:17,458
Were you there?

275
00:27:17,542 --> 00:27:21,000
No. I stopped after Desert Storm.

276
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:26,125
Well, thank you for your service, really.
And your dad too.

277
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:29,042
Okay, everyone always says that,

278
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:32,458
and it sounds about as empty
as "thoughts and prayers."

279
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:33,542
Babe.

280
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:35,750
Look, nobody knows
what you sacrificed, Ed.

281
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:38,750
- It's okay.
- I didn't mean to offend.

282
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:41,583
- I'm sorry. I... Really.
- No offense taken.

283
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:45,542
Did you ever kill anyone?

284
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:47,000
Jesus.

285
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,292
What?

286
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:52,875
I lost count.

287
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:57,458
Just kidding.

288
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:01,250
Whoa.

289
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,875
Your turn, Darby.

290
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:10,583
Three. So, where's everyone headed?

291
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:12,292
Two twos.

292
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:13,792
Ah, Reno.

293
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:18,292
Yeah, Sandi here surprised me with
a little vacation to my favorite city.

294
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:20,792
Reno's your favorite city?

295
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:24,333
Yeah, all the action of Vegas,
half the noise.

296
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:28,792
Ace.

297
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:31,000
Ace. And you, Darby?

298
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:32,833
- Two twos.
- Uh.

299
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:33,958
Three. Salt Lake.

300
00:28:34,042 --> 00:28:36,333
Four. What's in Salt Lake?

301
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:38,958
My mom's in the hospital.

302
00:28:39,042 --> 00:28:40,792
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.

303
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,458
Sandi's a nurse.

304
00:28:43,542 --> 00:28:44,917
Was a nurse.

305
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,750
- Two fives.
- Bullshit.

306
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:50,583
Goddamn it.

307
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,500
Told ya.

308
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:55,833
I go through Salt Lake on my way home.

309
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:57,833
Where's home?

310
00:28:57,917 --> 00:28:59,958
My parents live in Johnstown, near Denver.

311
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:02,042
Hmm, that's a long drive.

312
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:04,042
Queen.

313
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:05,958
King.

314
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:07,875
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit.

315
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:14,542
Nine. Um, Lars, so where you headed?

316
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:17,708
Uh…

317
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:19,208
- I'm headed home.
- Ten.

318
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:22,125
Battle Mountain?

319
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:25,208
Yeah. Yes, middle of Nevada.

320
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:37,667
Ed, are you gonna play or what?

321
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,750
Two nines.

322
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,792
Three tens.

323
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:44,833
Damn.

324
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,167
Bullshit.

325
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:48,250
Mm-mmm.

326
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:49,625
Ooh.

327
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:51,917
Screwed in your own game.
That's a bad beat.

328
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:53,750
Fuck that!

329
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,750
- Whoa. Hey, buddy.
- Hey, hey.

330
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:56,917
Relax.

331
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,583
We playing 52 Pickup now?

332
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:00,833
That's not... Don't...
That's not funny. Don't...

333
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:04,333
Don't... Don't make fun of me.

334
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:06,375
No one's laughing.

335
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:09,083
Yeah, I'm sorry. I...

336
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:13,500
Ugh, sometimes I just... Sorry. Sorry.

337
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:14,792
Shit.

338
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:16,833
- You need a hand with that?
- No.

339
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:18,500
You need to relax, young man.

340
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,458
Oh!

341
00:32:27,542 --> 00:32:29,000
We're getting out of here.

342
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:31,417
- Okay? I've just got to cut you free.
- Mm-hmm.

343
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,083
Are you sick?

344
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:37,167
Mm-hmm.

345
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:50,292
"That's a bad beat, huh?
Fifty-two Pickup, huh?"

346
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:53,958
That's funny. That's real funny, huh?

347
00:32:54,042 --> 00:32:56,000
I'll put a bullet
in your fuckin' brain funny!

348
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:57,375
How about that, huh?

349
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:02,167
Oh, sorry, Jay.

350
00:33:05,292 --> 00:33:08,542
Sometimes people...

351
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:13,125
You're lucky you're out here, Jay.
That place is full of liars and cheats.

352
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:17,083
I just came to warm it up for you.

353
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:27,083
Where's he going?

354
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:29,875
Sore Loser-ville.

355
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:33,417
Good thing he doesn't gamble.

356
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:38,208
Oh, it's gonna be a long night.

357
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:41,042
Yeah. That's better, huh?

358
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,875
Feeling better?

359
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:47,792
You don't look so great.

360
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:54,083
What the hell?

361
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:55,250
Oh, shit.

362
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,042
You do that?
Don't touch the cardboard, okay?

363
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,333
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

364
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:11,792
I know this is the scary part,
but you're gonna be all right.

365
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:13,583
You're gonna be more than all right.

366
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:18,208
Just gotta hang in there, Jay. All right?

367
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:21,208
It'll get much better when we get
to Uncle Kenny's. Trust me.

368
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:28,000
Shit! I was gonna bring you a snack.

369
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:29,375
You like snacks?

370
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:31,083
Brb.

371
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:35,583
Shit.

372
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:52,458
I can't be here when he comes back.

373
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:53,875
There's not much time.

374
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,250
Listen. Listen.

375
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:57,375
Your name's Jay, right?

376
00:34:57,458 --> 00:34:58,917
Mm-hmm.

377
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,333
My name's Darby,
and I need to go get help.

378
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:05,917
I'll come back.
I promise I will. I promise.

379
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:25,333
Party in the van?

380
00:35:30,917 --> 00:35:32,125
I left my phone out there.

381
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:35,000
Uh-huh.

382
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,667
I'll be back as soon as I can.

383
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:06,708
"Party in the van." Are you serious?

384
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,833
Shit.

385
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:52,625
Hello?

386
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:56,708
Darby?

387
00:36:57,833 --> 00:36:59,625
Everything okay in there?

388
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:03,083
Look, if you need someone to talk to
about your mom, I'm here.

389
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:05,417
Get in here. Get in here.

390
00:37:07,042 --> 00:37:09,333
- What? Yeah, what's going on?
- Just please...

391
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:23,375
Okay.

392
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,542
What the... What the hell is going on?

393
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:30,667
He has a little girl tied up in his van.

394
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,208
Mr. Bullshit?

395
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,292
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

396
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:43,208
She's little, like, nine or ten.

397
00:37:43,292 --> 00:37:44,833
I knew he was a fucking creep.

398
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:49,250
- We need to call the cops.
- I tried. I tried. No service.

399
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,292
Shit. No.

400
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:52,458
What do we do?

401
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,667
I don't know. I don't know.
I hoped maybe you or Ed...

402
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,000
Okay. Maybe we can wait until
there's a break in the storm,

403
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:02,625
- and then we can call cops.
- No, it's gonna take too long.

404
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:05,875
He's not gonna be able to go anywhere.
There's a blizzard. He can't drive any...

405
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:07,958
No, no, no. She's...

406
00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:11,583
She's sick or something.
She could die out there.

407
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:14,208
- We gotta go get her.
- Yeah.

408
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,125
But he's probably just waiting out there.

409
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:18,875
I think he knows that I was in the van.
That's why he came in here.

410
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:25,750
If he suspects you,
then he will follow you out, right?

411
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:27,417
Mm-hmm.

412
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,375
Okay, so if you go outside,

413
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:33,542
he follows you out just long enough
for me to tell Ed.

414
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:35,958
And then the both of us
will follow you straight out.

415
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:37,042
He has a gun.

416
00:38:39,042 --> 00:38:42,292
Look. Maybe Ed has a gun. He's a marine.

417
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:45,500
All right. You're gonna be okay.
You're not gonna be out there by yourself.

418
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:47,208
What if Ed doesn't have a gun?

419
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:53,292
Then we have to find something here.

420
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:10,333
Okay.

421
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:15,958
So, where is Reno?

422
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:18,208
Well, it's not on this map.

423
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:22,000
Forty miles north of Lake Tahoe.

424
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:27,375
I bet it'll still be there
when the storm clears.

425
00:39:32,042 --> 00:39:33,500
I'm sorry we're stuck here.

426
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:36,250
It's, uh... It's not your fault.

427
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,292
I was the one that said we should stay.

428
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:50,542
I know it hasn't been easy lately.

429
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:54,375
Maybe the universe is telling us
we need to spend more time together.

430
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,750
I have to pull it off.
Okay, like a Band-Aid.

431
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:59,250
One, two...

432
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:06,458
Fuck. It's okay.

433
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:10,667
It's okay. We're getting you
out of here right now, okay?

434
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,792
But where are the men?

435
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:16,375
Men?

436
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:19,708
The ones who took me.

437
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:25,167
How many men were there?

438
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,625
How many men?

439
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,375
Two.

440
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:33,667
What's wrong?

441
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:37,000
- She's in the van.
- Yeah, no shit, she's in the van.

442
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:56,708
- Why would you bring up Battle Mountain?
- I'm not good at making things up.

443
00:40:56,792 --> 00:40:59,708
Then stay quiet. Listen, and that's it.
Stay fucking quiet.

444
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:01,375
Now we gotta do damage control.

445
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:03,917
Give me the gun.

446
00:41:08,417 --> 00:41:10,958
- What's this?
- Careful.

447
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:13,250
I rigged the safety
so it fires like a real gun.

448
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:18,083
We were gonna ambush you.

449
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:20,708
Let's go.

450
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:24,458
What're we gonna do? Ash?

451
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,500
Keys.

452
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:37,208
Where the fuck is she?

453
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:39,833
Did you see anything?

454
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:40,917
No.

455
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,625
- I'm going out there.
- Ed. Ed.

456
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,583
Just relax.

457
00:42:06,292 --> 00:42:07,375
Keep fucking quiet.

458
00:42:09,792 --> 00:42:10,833
Fuck.

459
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,083
Go around.

460
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:32,833
Whew!

461
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:37,292
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, it's, uh... It's all good.

462
00:43:24,917 --> 00:43:26,625
I don't like that guy.

463
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:30,500
Ed, you don't know that guy.

464
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:32,500
I've known plenty of "that guy."

465
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,750
Weird little white boys
with a chip on their shoulder.

466
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:37,833
Give me your phone.

467
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:53,833
You text anyone else about this?

468
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:56,667
No.

469
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:57,750
Let's see.

470
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:02,833
Who sent these? Hmm?

471
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:05,583
My sister.

472
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:08,083
And she's expecting you at the hospital?

473
00:44:10,375 --> 00:44:11,375
Mm-hmm.

474
00:44:12,042 --> 00:44:13,792
And why would she write that?

475
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:16,833
She doesn't want you there
and, apparently, neither does your mom.

476
00:44:16,917 --> 00:44:17,917
Why do you care?

477
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,250
I need to know who's messing up my life
right now.

478
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:21,333
Hey!

479
00:44:25,917 --> 00:44:26,917
Where's Darby?

480
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:29,167
Darby?

481
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,583
Yeah. Darby.

482
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:34,708
I don't know.

483
00:44:41,667 --> 00:44:43,250
Ugh. Uh…

484
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:48,500
I think she's outside
trying to find bars.

485
00:44:49,292 --> 00:44:50,292
Darby's outside?

486
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:52,958
Yeah.

487
00:44:58,083 --> 00:44:59,250
I'll be back in a minute.

488
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:10,875
So your mom kicked you out of home,
huh?

489
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,500
Why'd she kick you out?

490
00:45:13,917 --> 00:45:15,125
Lots of reasons.

491
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:16,500
Yeah? What did you do?

492
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:21,625
Drugs.

493
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,750
What kind of drugs?

494
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:30,292
Whatever I could get.

495
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,875
Bet your dad loved that, huh?

496
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:36,167
Big-time war hero with a junkie daughter.

497
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:39,500
He's dead.

498
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:41,083
What, he die in the war?

499
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:51,167
He shot himself in the head.

500
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,167
Like this?

501
00:45:57,625 --> 00:45:58,792
No.

502
00:45:58,875 --> 00:45:59,917
Was it like this?

503
00:46:02,417 --> 00:46:05,583
- Um…
- Well, then, it must've been like this.

504
00:46:07,458 --> 00:46:08,458
No?

505
00:46:44,417 --> 00:46:48,833
First, the kid got sick,
then there's a storm, and now you.

506
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,458
- A junkie.
- You don't know me!

507
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:52,917
I know exactly who you are.

508
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
At least I'm not a child molester.

509
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:57,042
I'm not a fucking child molester.

510
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,000
This is about money.

511
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,500
You should see the house
that little girl lives in.

512
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:04,292
Her dad's some tech big shot.

513
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:08,042
So he's gonna pay and then we're gonna
ship her back without a fucking scratch.

514
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,125
She's sick.

515
00:47:10,042 --> 00:47:11,833
- She needs a doctor.
- Yeah, no shit.

516
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:14,292
She's got Addison's.

517
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:17,875
If she gets too excited,
she'll OD on adrenaline.

518
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:22,208
So your little intervention
didn't do her any favors.

519
00:47:55,625 --> 00:47:57,250
So, here's what's gonna happen.

520
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:58,958
We're gonna walk out...

521
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:09,792
Hi, uh, think I could talk to Darby
for a moment, please?

522
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:11,292
Sure.

523
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:13,125
I'll see you outside.

524
00:48:14,542 --> 00:48:17,125
Fuck this up,
I'll kill everyone.

525
00:48:25,292 --> 00:48:27,333
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

526
00:48:29,417 --> 00:48:32,042
We're just... We're stuck here. So…

527
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:34,458
Mmm.

528
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:44,667
You know,
if there's anything else that you, um…

529
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:46,083
I can handle it.

530
00:48:46,167 --> 00:48:47,167
Darby.

531
00:48:50,292 --> 00:48:55,542
- Lars was spying on us earlier.
- Oh.

532
00:48:55,625 --> 00:49:01,875
So I wanted to talk to Ash alone
without him following me.

533
00:49:01,958 --> 00:49:02,958
Mmm.

534
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:06,250
Okay.

535
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:09,833
'Cause if there is something
that's really wrong

536
00:49:09,917 --> 00:49:14,833
and you need to tell me anything,
you will, right?

537
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:24,792
Do you know anything
about brain aneurysms?

538
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:28,750
Uh, is that why your mom's
in the hospital?

539
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:31,583
Is she gonna die?

540
00:49:33,042 --> 00:49:36,375
If she's in the hospital,
she's in the best place she can be, right?

541
00:49:57,167 --> 00:49:59,458
Darby, wanna join us?

542
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:01,458
Please?

543
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:16,583
You said your dad was Third Battalion,
First Marines?

544
00:50:17,292 --> 00:50:18,792
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

545
00:50:19,542 --> 00:50:20,542
What'd he do?

546
00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:23,083
He was a gunner.

547
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:27,125
How 'bout that. So was I.

548
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:29,958
I bet we could swap some stories.

549
00:50:31,917 --> 00:50:37,667
What you said earlier about me not knowing
what they go through, you were right.

550
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:42,000
Darby, she told me what her dad did

551
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:45,333
when he got home.

552
00:50:47,917 --> 00:50:49,417
It's a tragedy.

553
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,083
I mean,
someone taking their own life like that…

554
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:56,500
I can't imagine that kind of pain.

555
00:51:07,042 --> 00:51:08,542
Sorry about your dad.

556
00:51:12,167 --> 00:51:14,208
That wasn't your goddamn story to share.

557
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:18,542
You might wanna think harder
before you open your damn mouth.

558
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:25,792
Jesus.

559
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:30,042
Well…

560
00:51:50,792 --> 00:51:52,458
I should go apologize.

561
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:54,167
Yeah, you should.

562
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,708
No!

563
00:52:18,667 --> 00:52:21,667
All you had to do was nothing.

564
00:52:27,083 --> 00:52:29,167
Ash?

565
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,625
What are you doing?

566
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:33,625
Where's the girl?

567
00:52:33,708 --> 00:52:36,542
She went up a hiking trail.
Uncle Kenny's gonna be so pissed.

568
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:39,500
Uncle Kenny's not gonna find out.
We're gonna go get her right now.

569
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:41,042
She's not gonna come to us.

570
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:43,458
Doesn't matter how cold she is.

571
00:52:43,542 --> 00:52:45,000
Maybe not.

572
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:47,875
But she'll come to her.

573
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,625
- Get up.
- Come on.

574
00:52:51,708 --> 00:52:54,542
- Quick, she's gonna freeze to death.
- Get up.

575
00:52:54,625 --> 00:52:55,750
- Hurry!
- Don't worry.

576
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:57,708
- We're gonna find her, all right?
- Okay.

577
00:52:57,792 --> 00:53:00,042
- She won't get far.
- Yeah.

578
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:07,625
I'm cold.

579
00:53:08,667 --> 00:53:09,875
It's really cold.

580
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,542
Should've worn something warmer.

581
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:17,833
We just gotta keep pushing, all right?
We're almost out of here.

582
00:53:17,917 --> 00:53:20,958
When we get to Uncle Kenny's
we're gonna look back at this and laugh.

583
00:53:21,042 --> 00:53:23,708
Yeah.
We're not gonna tell him anything, though.

584
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:28,000
Remember what happened last time?
He went nuts.

585
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:29,083
Yeah.

586
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:30,167
He was so pissed.

587
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:31,875
Who's Uncle Kenny?

588
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:35,458
He's our foster dad.
Took us in when no one else would.

589
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:37,375
Better than blood.

590
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:38,458
That's right.

591
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:44,833
What's Uncle Kenny think
about your line of work?

592
00:53:45,375 --> 00:53:46,542
We work for him.

593
00:53:47,375 --> 00:53:49,000
He finds them better homes.

594
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:52,208
Call out for her.

595
00:53:53,458 --> 00:53:54,458
Do it.

596
00:53:55,417 --> 00:53:56,542
Jay?

597
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:00,792
Jay.

598
00:54:01,625 --> 00:54:02,625
Louder.

599
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:06,417
She dies out here, it's your fault.

600
00:54:06,958 --> 00:54:08,042
Jay!

601
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,667
Louder.

602
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:17,625
Louder, so she can hear it.

603
00:54:18,667 --> 00:54:19,792
Jay!

604
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:23,167
- I told you she wasn't gonna go...
- Jay!

605
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:24,500
Ah, shit!

606
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:36,542
- That was a gunshot.
- Hmm.

607
00:54:36,625 --> 00:54:37,917
Are you sure?

608
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:40,708
There's only one thing
that sounds like a gunshot.

609
00:54:40,792 --> 00:54:41,750
Ed.

610
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,833
- Is she alive?
- Yes, she's alive. She's in a bad way.

611
00:56:25,917 --> 00:56:27,375
- Shot? Oh!
- No.

612
00:56:27,458 --> 00:56:28,458
Be careful now.

613
00:56:46,958 --> 00:56:48,042
Lars!

614
00:57:03,417 --> 00:57:04,583
Hey.

615
00:57:04,667 --> 00:57:06,958
Oh, God. Ed, she's freezing.
Give me your coat.

616
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:09,250
Where the hell did she come from?

617
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:10,458
Come on, honey.

618
00:57:13,042 --> 00:57:14,500
Shh. Come on.

619
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:17,000
- What's this?
- It's a medical alert bracelet.

620
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:20,667
She's in an adrenal crisis.

621
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:36,750
- You got her.
- You know this girl?

622
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:41,292
Ash and Lars kidnapped her.
She was in their van.

623
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,375
What?

624
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,042
Ash has a gun. He's gonna kill us all
if we don't get out of here.

625
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:46,667
Jesus Chr...

626
00:57:49,583 --> 00:57:52,208
- She beat us back.
- I can see that.

627
00:57:52,292 --> 00:57:54,042
We have to go now.

628
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:56,583
Ed, she's right.
We need to... We need to move.

629
00:57:56,667 --> 00:57:57,958
Come on, honey.

630
00:57:58,042 --> 00:57:59,667
- What do we do...
- Lars! Give me a minute!

631
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,250
- Yeah, yeah. All right.
- All right?

632
00:58:02,792 --> 00:58:07,250
Hey! Give us the girl
and no one gets hurt.

633
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,458
They're gonna kill us.

634
00:58:12,917 --> 00:58:14,792
Don't make me come in there and get her.

635
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:16,625
That's not gonna stop them.

636
00:58:16,708 --> 00:58:18,208
I'm buying us time.

637
00:58:18,292 --> 00:58:19,792
What are we doing here?

638
00:58:27,667 --> 00:58:28,958
- You ready?
- Yeah.

639
00:58:29,042 --> 00:58:31,625
Okay. I got Ed, you cover the other two.

640
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:32,833
- Okay.
- Okay?

641
00:58:34,792 --> 00:58:35,833
Here they come.

642
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,417
You walk through that door,
I will shoot you dead.

643
00:58:51,375 --> 00:58:53,000
You think he's really got a gun?

644
00:58:53,542 --> 00:58:54,542
I don't know.

645
00:58:55,708 --> 00:58:56,708
Ed!

646
00:58:57,833 --> 00:59:00,000
I think I'm gonna call bullshit on that.

647
00:59:00,083 --> 00:59:02,708
Okay. Come on in.

648
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:06,042
Fuck!

649
00:59:08,708 --> 00:59:09,708
Is it working?

650
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:15,542
They're talking.

651
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:20,292
Good. Let them talk all they want.
Out there.

652
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:24,250
We gotta get her out of there.

653
00:59:24,833 --> 00:59:27,667
- No shit, Lars.
- She probably needs her medication.

654
00:59:30,917 --> 00:59:34,167
You're a goddamn genius, Lars.
You're a goddamn genius!

655
00:59:36,167 --> 00:59:38,042
The girl is sick.

656
00:59:40,208 --> 00:59:43,125
She needs her meds, and we have them, Ed.

657
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:45,750
Huh? We have them!

658
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:49,208
Sandi, you're the nurse.

659
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:52,667
You know it's true.
You keep her, she dies.

660
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:55,458
It's your choice.

661
00:59:56,875 --> 00:59:57,875
He's right.

662
00:59:59,708 --> 01:00:03,292
You give her to us, we'll be gone.
It's that simple.

663
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:05,333
I say we do it.

664
01:00:05,417 --> 01:00:06,875
- No!
- No!

665
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:11,667
If this girl does not get her medication,
she will die. Let them take her.

666
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:14,333
They can't leave. I have their keys.

667
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:16,458
What?

668
01:00:16,958 --> 01:00:20,375
No. You have to give them back.
We want them to leave. They have to leave.

669
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:22,042
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

670
01:00:23,708 --> 01:00:24,708
Hey, Ash?

671
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:26,542
Yeah?

672
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:29,333
Give us the medicine,
and we'll let you leave.

673
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:31,208
Are you serious?

674
01:00:32,042 --> 01:00:35,875
Yeah. Give us the medicine,
and we'll give you the keys to your van.

675
01:00:43,917 --> 01:00:44,917
Ash?

676
01:00:47,375 --> 01:00:48,375
Ash!

677
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:53,125
Medicine for the keys.

678
01:01:02,917 --> 01:01:04,167
Are they doing it?

679
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:08,625
They're walking back to the van.

680
01:01:21,417 --> 01:01:24,542
Can you see anything?
Do they have the medicine?

681
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:25,875
No. They have a gas can.

682
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:27,542
What? No, no.

683
01:01:28,208 --> 01:01:30,000
- Shit.
- What the fuck do we do now?

684
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:32,333
They're bluffing.
They're not crazy enough to do it.

685
01:01:32,417 --> 01:01:34,833
- I think maybe they are.
- Just give them what they want.

686
01:01:34,917 --> 01:01:36,125
If we do that, we're dead.

687
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:37,542
You don't know that.

688
01:01:39,167 --> 01:01:40,292
Wait, wait, wait.

689
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:43,125
They can't kill us if they can't leave,
right?

690
01:01:43,208 --> 01:01:46,500
Hide the keys. These too.

691
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:49,375
Go ahead.

692
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:52,875
Ed!

693
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,625
Hey, Ed!

694
01:02:03,167 --> 01:02:04,167
Ed.

695
01:02:05,667 --> 01:02:08,042
We should just give them what they want.

696
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:09,625
We've been in holes before.

697
01:02:10,208 --> 01:02:13,750
And we're gonna claw ourselves out
of this one the way we always do.

698
01:02:13,833 --> 01:02:16,708
But this isn't a hole. This is a grave.

699
01:02:16,792 --> 01:02:18,417
Splash it everywhere. Let's go.

700
01:02:20,875 --> 01:02:22,375
So what's your plan, Ash?

701
01:02:23,292 --> 01:02:25,750
What does it look like, Ed? Huh?

702
01:02:25,833 --> 01:02:27,083
It looks like you're thinking about

703
01:02:27,167 --> 01:02:29,000
setting fire
to the only thing you care about

704
01:02:29,083 --> 01:02:31,833
and stranding yourself
at the scene of the crime.

705
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:36,542
You're stupid, Ash,
but you're not that stupid.

706
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:38,542
You know what's stupid, Ed?

707
01:02:39,042 --> 01:02:42,583
Stupid is getting yourself killed
for a stranger.

708
01:02:42,667 --> 01:02:45,583
I'm a Marine, you idiot. It's what we do.

709
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:51,125
How about you, Sandi?

710
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:55,583
You wanna die
because Ed wants to play hero?

711
01:02:55,667 --> 01:02:56,667
Huh?

712
01:03:01,583 --> 01:03:04,042
You give us the medicine.
We give you the keys.

713
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:06,000
You drive out and it's done.

714
01:03:06,708 --> 01:03:08,250
I'm done talking, Ed.

715
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:11,583
They're hidden.

716
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:13,500
Good.

717
01:03:13,583 --> 01:03:16,958
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I forgot I have something better.

718
01:03:21,667 --> 01:03:23,583
Since when you been carrying Mace?

719
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:27,167
I'd need a much bigger purse
to fit everything you don't know about me.

720
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,417
Give me the matches.

721
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,333
Are we really gonna burn 'em?

722
01:03:32,417 --> 01:03:33,458
That's up to them.

723
01:03:40,458 --> 01:03:41,583
Five!

724
01:03:41,667 --> 01:03:42,958
They won't do it.

725
01:03:44,958 --> 01:03:46,333
Four!

726
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:49,708
Ed, please.

727
01:03:51,625 --> 01:03:52,958
Three!

728
01:03:54,333 --> 01:03:55,333
Fuck.

729
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:57,833
Ed, I don't wanna die here.

730
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,833
Nobody is dying here.

731
01:03:59,917 --> 01:04:01,292
Get in here.

732
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:04,375
Ash? Come on. What are you doing?

733
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:07,042
Two!

734
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:09,167
Ed, please.

735
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:13,208
He's crazy. He's gonna... He's gonna do it.
We should give them what they want.

736
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:15,917
They're bluffing.

737
01:04:19,833 --> 01:04:20,958
Mrs. Lowery?

738
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:31,917
Hey, guys. This is my maid, Mrs. Lowery.
And now she's gonna do the dance.

739
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Ready?

740
01:04:33,083 --> 01:04:34,583
No... Honey, I've got work to do.

741
01:04:34,667 --> 01:04:36,375
Well, then, I could tell my mom

742
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:39,417
about that time I caught you smoking pot
on the porch.

743
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:42,000
Uh...

744
01:04:42,083 --> 01:04:43,083
Like this.

745
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:44,667
<i>♪ Put your hands up ♪</i>

746
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:48,042
<i>Everybody go whoo!
Put your hands up!</i>

747
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:49,833
Come on, dance with the vacuum.

748
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:51,583
Do it!

749
01:04:51,667 --> 01:04:52,833
<i>♪ Put your hands up ♪</i>

750
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,167
<i>♪ Everybody go whoo! ♪</i>

751
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:58,625
That is so tragic!

752
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:02,208
Oh, my gosh, you guys.
That is so hilarious.

753
01:05:02,292 --> 01:05:03,375
This that video?

754
01:05:05,208 --> 01:05:09,417
Yeah.
Jay does that kind of thing all the time.

755
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:10,833
And you didn't hear anything?

756
01:05:12,833 --> 01:05:15,292
Well, I was vacuuming
and I had my headphones on.

757
01:05:15,375 --> 01:05:17,625
No! Please!

758
01:05:17,708 --> 01:05:20,375
- Help, Mrs. Lower...
- Stop! Come...

759
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:24,125
- Calm down! It's gonna be okay.
- Let me go!

760
01:05:24,208 --> 01:05:26,458
- Shut up!
- Let me go!

761
01:05:30,167 --> 01:05:32,250
<i>The medicine
wasn't where you said it would be.</i>

762
01:05:32,333 --> 01:05:33,667
<i>And now she's dying again.</i>

763
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:35,208
<i>So you need to come meet us,</i>

764
01:05:35,292 --> 01:05:39,333
<i>or we'll bury this kid in the mountains
and you get nothing. You got that?</i>

765
01:05:44,458 --> 01:05:45,625
One!

766
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:47,292
Wait! Wait!

767
01:05:47,917 --> 01:05:49,333
He doesn't have a gun!

768
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,250
- What the fuck did you just do?
- God! She's the one who fucking did...

769
01:05:57,333 --> 01:06:00,208
Jesus Christ, Sandi!

770
01:06:00,292 --> 01:06:02,000
Are you crazy?

771
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:06,333
Ash, what... What'd she say?

772
01:06:06,417 --> 01:06:09,458
The bank called me,
and they told me that it was all gone.

773
01:06:09,958 --> 01:06:14,167
Our savings, our future. All of it, Ed.

774
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:15,750
All of it!

775
01:06:15,833 --> 01:06:18,667
So I tried to fix it. That is what I did.

776
01:06:22,958 --> 01:06:25,875
Why didn't you just say something?
I had a plan!

777
01:06:25,958 --> 01:06:28,583
What? You're gonna win it back?

778
01:06:28,667 --> 01:06:30,417
We're coming in, Ed.

779
01:06:36,417 --> 01:06:38,500
Drop it! Drop it!

780
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:41,958
- Lars, take her over by Jay.
- What?

781
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:44,958
Do it.

782
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:49,458
Stay there!

783
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,833
Please, don't move. Please.

784
01:06:56,167 --> 01:06:58,708
- Leave...
- You're gonna... You're gonna be okay.

785
01:06:58,792 --> 01:07:01,792
I just wanna go home.

786
01:07:01,875 --> 01:07:02,875
Yeah, I do too.

787
01:07:04,875 --> 01:07:05,917
Are you done?

788
01:07:08,583 --> 01:07:09,708
Hurry up, Sandi!

789
01:07:14,833 --> 01:07:16,292
You'll be okay now, Jay.

790
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,083
Kid's gonna live. Hallelujah!

791
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,708
How did you even meet these freaks?

792
01:07:20,792 --> 01:07:21,917
The Internet.

793
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,000
We were never even supposed to meet
and nothing was supposed to happen to Jay

794
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:28,917
and nothing is going to happen to her,
right?

795
01:07:29,667 --> 01:07:31,458
You're still gonna ransom her, right?

796
01:07:31,958 --> 01:07:34,792
They were never gonna ransom her.

797
01:07:34,875 --> 01:07:38,125
They traffic kids. They sell them.

798
01:07:38,625 --> 01:07:39,833
You got catfished.

799
01:07:39,917 --> 01:07:41,125
Don't you say that.

800
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:44,542
Yeah. We're finding her a better home.

801
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:46,833
Right, Ash?

802
01:07:46,917 --> 01:07:48,417
- That's right, Lars.
- Yeah!

803
01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:54,542
No. Whatever you were planning,
you can still change your minds.

804
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:56,458
It's $2 million.

805
01:07:56,542 --> 01:07:59,458
Is someone offering you more than that?
Huh?

806
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:03,625
Whatever it is,
Jay's parents will triple it.

807
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:05,708
- They'll... They'll triple...
- No.

808
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,750
Ed, you get it, right?

809
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:13,458
I just did it for the money.
It's so much money...

810
01:08:13,542 --> 01:08:16,458
Sandi, this isn't about the fucking money.
Shut up.

811
01:08:16,958 --> 01:08:19,917
We don't deliver the kid, we're fucked.

812
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:23,833
Okay.

813
01:08:26,083 --> 01:08:27,250
Okay.

814
01:08:29,292 --> 01:08:33,333
Okay, you've got her now,
so why don't you just leave?

815
01:08:33,417 --> 01:08:35,042
Well, that's a good idea, Sandi.

816
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:38,542
Where are the keys, Ed?

817
01:08:39,708 --> 01:08:40,708
I don't know.

818
01:08:40,792 --> 01:08:44,417
I'm done playing games!
Where did you put the keys?

819
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:45,542
Fuck you.

820
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:47,458
She hid them out back somewhere.

821
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:50,250
Darby!

822
01:08:50,333 --> 01:08:52,083
Where did you put the keys?

823
01:08:52,167 --> 01:08:55,125
Listen, you tell him, and we're all dead.

824
01:08:57,292 --> 01:09:00,042
No!

825
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:01,500
Oh, God.

826
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:03,875
No!

827
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:29,875
Oh, Ed.

828
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:33,125
I'm so sorry.

829
01:09:37,333 --> 01:09:39,708
No, no!

830
01:09:44,542 --> 01:09:46,000
No, no! No!

831
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:56,333
No! No! No! No, please! No!

832
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,292
Please! No, please!

833
01:10:03,625 --> 01:10:08,125
Please! Please! Please! Please! Please!

834
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:10,583
Listen, please, please!

835
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:27,417
Ash. Ash, my eyes!

836
01:10:33,208 --> 01:10:34,667
Hey. Let me see.

837
01:10:36,042 --> 01:10:39,917
We're gonna wash it out. Okay? Come on.

838
01:10:43,292 --> 01:10:46,625
Jay, if you move, I'll kill her.

839
01:11:30,542 --> 01:11:33,500
You killed him.
You shot him dead.

840
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:35,083
You shot him.

841
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,583
Ja... Jay!

842
01:11:58,833 --> 01:12:01,250
I need your hel...
I need your help.

843
01:12:03,375 --> 01:12:04,833
It's okay. Quickly.

844
01:12:05,417 --> 01:12:07,833
Come... Come here. Come here.

845
01:12:07,917 --> 01:12:10,333
I had to. I had no choice.
I have to look after us. All right?

846
01:12:10,417 --> 01:12:12,250
- I know. I know!
- I have to look after...

847
01:12:12,333 --> 01:12:13,875
I have to look after you, Lars!

848
01:12:25,625 --> 01:12:27,792
- I'm scared.
- I need the hammer.

849
01:12:28,583 --> 01:12:29,958
I need the hammer.

850
01:12:32,208 --> 01:12:34,000
I need you to keep it together.

851
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:37,667
We just gotta get the keys,
and we're gone. All right? Come on.

852
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:38,792
Let's go.

853
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,542
- No.
- Shh!

854
01:12:54,417 --> 01:12:55,625
Okay, okay.

855
01:12:55,708 --> 01:12:58,250
It's quitting time, Darby.
Where are the keys?

856
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,750
I don't have them.

857
01:13:23,167 --> 01:13:24,208
Your mom died.

858
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:43,833
Thoughts and prayers.

859
01:14:02,833 --> 01:14:03,833
What's wrong?

860
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,167
The text to the cops went through.

861
01:14:08,833 --> 01:14:09,958
You know she sent a text?

862
01:14:10,792 --> 01:14:12,292
Yeah, but I deleted it.

863
01:14:16,833 --> 01:14:17,833
Where are the keys?

864
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:20,750
Keys.

865
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:23,417
Where are the keys, Darby?

866
01:14:25,958 --> 01:14:30,208
No! Please! No!

867
01:14:31,792 --> 01:14:33,042
Ash, don't!

868
01:14:34,417 --> 01:14:36,958
- Please, no. No, please!
- In the snow.

869
01:14:37,042 --> 01:14:38,458
- In the...
- Please!

870
01:14:38,542 --> 01:14:40,250
In the snow outside the bathroom!

871
01:14:40,792 --> 01:14:43,042
No.

872
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:47,250
Lars.

873
01:14:50,583 --> 01:14:51,958
All right. Hold it.

874
01:14:54,333 --> 01:14:55,917
Come on. You got that?

875
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,583
If she tries anything,
you shoot her, okay?

876
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:08,750
<i>All roads are opening back up…</i>

877
01:15:39,417 --> 01:15:41,667
It's okay, Jay.
We're gonna be out of here soon.

878
01:15:59,458 --> 01:16:00,792
Come on.

879
01:16:07,375 --> 01:16:10,792
I need you to turn out the lights.

880
01:16:18,625 --> 01:16:19,625
I can't.

881
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:21,458
Yes, you can.

882
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:24,708
He won't hurt you.

883
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:31,625
Jay, what are you doing?

884
01:16:31,708 --> 01:16:34,458
- Lars. I know you don't wanna hurt Jay.
- Jay, sit down.

885
01:16:35,167 --> 01:16:37,667
Go back now. Jay, sit down!

886
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:40,000
- Lars. Listen to me.
- Uh-huh?

887
01:16:40,083 --> 01:16:42,458
You're not that guy, Lars.
You don't have to do this.

888
01:16:42,542 --> 01:16:44,708
- Jay, don't...
- Lars, that's not who you are.

889
01:16:44,792 --> 01:16:46,750
- You're not like him.
- Shut up! Shut up!

890
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:48,708
- Put the gun down, Lars.
- Stop.

891
01:16:48,792 --> 01:16:51,958
- Lars, she's just a little girl!
- Tell her to sit down! Tell her.

892
01:16:52,042 --> 01:16:56,125
- It's okay, Jay. It's okay.
- I need you to sit down, okay?

893
01:16:56,875 --> 01:16:58,417
I have a gun. Jay.

894
01:16:59,208 --> 01:17:01,500
Jay, where are you going? Jay. Please.

895
01:17:02,167 --> 01:17:03,708
He told you what was gonna happen.

896
01:17:04,417 --> 01:17:07,833
Don't make me use this. Huh? Jay?

897
01:17:12,625 --> 01:17:14,250
I need you to sit down now.

898
01:17:14,917 --> 01:17:17,208
Jay. Before he comes back,
I need you to sit down.

899
01:17:17,792 --> 01:17:18,875
Wait... No... Don't...

900
01:17:19,958 --> 01:17:21,667
Turn the light back on.

901
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:24,417
No! No!

902
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:25,542
Darby!

903
01:17:26,667 --> 01:17:28,417
Hang on! No!

904
01:17:32,292 --> 01:17:33,917
- No!
- Come on!

905
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,875
- No!
- Jay, stand up!

906
01:17:36,417 --> 01:17:38,042
- Get off the ground!
- No!

907
01:17:38,667 --> 01:17:40,750
Jay!

908
01:17:42,167 --> 01:17:44,042
Get up!

909
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:46,917
Yes, yes.

910
01:17:49,042 --> 01:17:51,042
No!

911
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:00,833
Oh, shit.

912
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:03,208
Oh, shit. Shit!

913
01:18:19,625 --> 01:18:22,958
Ash. Ash. I'm sorry.

914
01:18:23,042 --> 01:18:24,542
Drop it or I'll fucking kill him.

915
01:18:24,625 --> 01:18:26,667
No, don't let her.

916
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:29,000
- She's not gonna do it. It's okay.
- The fuck I won't!

917
01:18:29,875 --> 01:18:33,375
- Drop it.
- Hey, leave him alone! Leave him alone!

918
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:36,125
Then do what I fucking say!

919
01:18:52,042 --> 01:18:53,375
Ash.

920
01:18:54,292 --> 01:18:55,958
- I feel weird.
- Lars.

921
01:18:57,375 --> 01:18:58,542
I got you.

922
01:18:58,625 --> 01:18:59,667
My head.

923
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:02,000
- Hey, don't touch it.
- Come on. Get back. Get back.

924
01:19:02,083 --> 01:19:04,333
Holy shit, it's in my head?

925
01:19:04,417 --> 01:19:06,500
- Is it bad?
- It's okay. It's okay.

926
01:19:07,083 --> 01:19:09,083
- I wanna go home.
- Listen.

927
01:19:09,167 --> 01:19:12,417
I'm gonna get you home, okay?
Come on. I got the keys to the van.

928
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:13,708
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right? Yeah?

929
01:19:13,792 --> 01:19:16,333
Come on. Go, go, go!

930
01:19:16,417 --> 01:19:19,042
- We're gonna go home, okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

931
01:19:19,125 --> 01:19:22,167
- And then I'm...
- Ash, how do we get out of here?

932
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,625
Get in the car.

933
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:35,583
Lars?

934
01:22:25,083 --> 01:22:26,500
Oh, my Christ.

935
01:22:32,875 --> 01:22:36,292
Oh, thank God.
Officer, there's been an accident!

936
01:22:36,375 --> 01:22:37,708
Step away from the vehicle.

937
01:22:37,792 --> 01:22:40,333
- Please, hurry up!
- Sir, step away from the car!

938
01:22:40,958 --> 01:22:42,125
There are people that are hurt!

939
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:44,458
I need to see both your hands!

940
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:46,000
They are hurt real bad!

941
01:22:46,083 --> 01:22:47,333
Listen to me!

942
01:22:47,417 --> 01:22:49,167
Hands up where I can see them!

943
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:50,833
- Officer, there's a little girl!
- Freeze!

944
01:22:50,917 --> 01:22:52,250
Now! Sir!

945
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:54,667
- You're not listening to me!
- There are people hurt in here.

946
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:57,500
- Please! Thank God! Hurry up, help us!
- Sir, please.

947
01:23:03,292 --> 01:23:06,875
- Hey, you! Stop! Listen to me!
- You...

948
01:23:06,958 --> 01:23:09,167
- Put your weapon down!
- Stop! Wait!

949
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,292
- You don't get it! Wait!
- Put the gun down.

950
01:23:11,375 --> 01:23:12,833
- No! He's the...
- Put it down now!

951
01:23:12,917 --> 01:23:14,083
Right fucking now!

952
01:23:14,167 --> 01:23:15,458
He's the...

953
01:23:52,958 --> 01:23:54,750
Help. Help...

954
01:24:46,292 --> 01:24:47,667
Remind me how it was again.

955
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:49,667
Was it like this?

956
01:24:53,167 --> 01:24:54,167
Or was it like this?

957
01:24:58,708 --> 01:25:00,542
Oh, no, no, no, no.

958
01:25:02,917 --> 01:25:03,917
It was like this.

959
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,375
- Darby?
- Mm-hmm.

960
01:25:59,625 --> 01:26:01,333
Where are you?

961
01:26:15,792 --> 01:26:16,792
Darby?

962
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:19,250
Darby!

963
01:26:30,042 --> 01:26:31,250
Darby!

964
01:27:33,083 --> 01:27:34,208
I need help.

965
01:27:38,375 --> 01:27:40,083
<i>Corporal Hill?</i>

966
01:27:42,833 --> 01:27:44,458
<i>Are you in need of assistance?</i>

967
01:27:46,458 --> 01:27:49,000

You've got a visitor.

971
