that the law of salvage is

This was piracy.

[judge] Mr. Moreland,

you have provided no

nor permission to salvage
from the Spanish authorities.

The cargo salvaged by the Atlantic Group

165
00:15:21,568 --> 00:15:24,267
[in English] Um... here.

166
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:25,467
[man] Nice.

167
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:27,167
[Claudia] <i>E</i> here.

168
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,334
[man] Uh-huh.

169
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:30,301
- [in Italian] Thank you.
- You're welcome.

170
00:15:30,434 --> 00:15:32,733
- [man in English] Have a safe trip.
- [Claudia in Italian] See you.

171
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:36,100
[in English] Now, the rest
of you, I'm going to treat...

172
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:38,467
Why did you do that?

173
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:39,733
Do what?

174
00:15:39,867 --> 00:15:41,800
Well, you stole his wallet.

175
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,367
I thought you did.

176
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:47,067
Check your pocket.

177
00:15:52,934 --> 00:15:55,767
[gasps] What did you do?

178
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,167
Okay, I'm maybe just very boring,

179
00:15:58,301 --> 00:16:02,134
but I really don't want to get
involved with this, okay? Thank you.

180
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:06,601
Look, you can give it back to its owner,

181
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:09,201
tell him you found it on the floor,

182
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:13,401
and remain a law-abiding citizen.

183
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:16,301
Make your daddy proud. It's okay.

184
00:16:19,534 --> 00:16:20,767
Or?

185
00:16:22,034 --> 00:16:25,301
Be an accomplice and come with me.

190
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,467
Wait for me there.

[cell phone buzzes]

192
00:16:56,467 --> 00:16:58,534
Along with your father's voice mails,

193
00:16:58,668 --> 00:17:03,201
you'll hear from several leading oil
companies with increasingly rich offers.

194
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:07,833
Beer.

195
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:16,367
Don't worry about Lorraine.
She can look after herself.

196
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:20,267
Oh, it's Lorraine now.

197
00:17:20,401 --> 00:17:25,134
Enough with this cloak-and-dagger
nonsense. What's this game all about?

198
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:27,568
I'm Walter Moreland.

199
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,334
I'm the owner of a salvage business.

200
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,134
And I have a job offer.

201
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:35,733
I want you to help me break into the vault

202
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:38,733
of the most secure location in the world.

203
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,900
[laughs] Okay, very good.

204
00:17:46,034 --> 00:17:48,601
Do I look like Danny Ocean?

205
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:50,434
He's a, uh...

206
00:17:51,634 --> 00:17:52,700
I'm an engineer.

207
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,800
And your idea ended the Gulf crisis.

208
00:17:55,934 --> 00:17:58,733
Where others saw futility,
you saw a solution.

209
00:17:58,867 --> 00:17:59,900
It's the same with my problem.

210
00:18:00,034 --> 00:18:02,634
I see an impossible task.

211
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:04,467
You might see a way to overcome it.

212
00:18:04,601 --> 00:18:08,100
You probably need a safecracker,
someone who actually does this stuff.

213
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:12,467
Thieves want to rob a bank today,
they use a keyboard and a modem.

214
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:14,267
Great. Go and do that.

215
00:18:14,934 --> 00:18:15,900
I'm not a thief.

216
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:17,867
Oh, really? How do you figure?

217
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,934
Well, the vault, how it works, what it is,

218
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,467
we can't work it out.

219
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:26,134
For 80 years, no one has.

220
00:18:26,267 --> 00:18:29,301
It's been described as
a miracle of engineering,

221
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:31,867
but we don't even know what that means.

222
00:18:32,867 --> 00:18:34,334
I need your mind,

223
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:37,601
because I'm not just looking
for a solution to a problem.

224
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:39,733
I don't know what the problem is.

225
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,067
Why the hell would you think I'd do this?

226
00:18:45,201 --> 00:18:49,501
Well, aside from making you richer
than you ever thought possible,

227
00:18:49,634 --> 00:18:51,867
for the first time today...

Dad, uh, it's me.

233
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,733
Just wanted to let you know that I'm...

234
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:58,367
going to go off.

235
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:02,900
I need to go away for a few
days, think a few things over.

Walter was right.

242
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:31,134
I wasn't so sure.

- Yes.

Yes, right?

You are very welcome.

He hasn't even mastered shaving, and
he's going to mastermind the infiltration?

- Mastermind?
- [James] Yeah.

279
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:35,234
To succeed where all others
have failed takes a mastermind.

Oh.

281
00:22:37,534 --> 00:22:38,800
[Walter] Klaus, are we in?

282
00:22:38,934 --> 00:22:41,100
Yeah, we got the phone
line, I can listen in,

283
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,967
but I need an employee
voice mail code to break in.

284
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,334
A voice mail access code lets
you break into the system?

285
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:50,967
The Renaissance-art, genius of a
virus I created breaks the system.

286
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,767
- [scoffs]
- The code just lets us touch the loop.

to get a voice mail code.

289
00:23:00,634 --> 00:23:02,000
Have you got a better plan?

290
00:23:02,134 --> 00:23:02,934
Listen.

00:23:08,501 --> 00:23:10,634
- [sounds stop]
- He calls numbers in the bank's switchboard,

293
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:14,334
then keys random nine-digit
numbers, hoping to get a match.

294
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:18,034
It doesn't check one at a time. It
makes ten million attempts a day.

00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:20,467
- How many combinations are there?
- A billion.

296
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:22,000
What?

297
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,634
Klaus, we don't have time.

298
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:27,501
Find an employee who's out of the office,

299
00:23:27,634 --> 00:23:30,733
call them on their mobile, pretend
to be one of those automated messages

300
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,334
telling them they've got urgent voice mail.

301
00:23:32,467 --> 00:23:36,134
They'll key in their
passcode, and you can copy it.

302
00:23:36,267 --> 00:23:39,234
[scoffs] Come on. They won't fall for that.

303
00:23:39,367 --> 00:23:42,601
It's a voice mail code, not
bank details. Why wouldn't they?

304
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:45,700
Try it. Simon, you be the message.

Well done, Thom.

Thom? That's my hack.

318
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:30,134
Yes, but he made it work. So simple.

319
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:57,000
Unpacking now doesn't
mean you can't walk later.

You'll just be walking
away with less creases.

I just don't really
know what I'm doing here.

00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,733
[air brakes hiss]

326
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,167
Ah, another dead end.

327
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:10,833
Ah.

328
00:26:12,267 --> 00:26:14,334
Do you know who Sir Francis Drake was?

329
00:26:14,467 --> 00:26:17,967
Yeah. An English sailor from the 1500s.

330
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,234
Fought the Spanish Armada.

331
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:22,234
He wasn't navy. He was a privateer.

332
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:24,934
- Like a pirate?
- Mmm, it's a fine line.

333
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:26,201
Hmm.

334
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:29,100
Drake resented his orders
to steal Spanish treasure

335
00:26:29,234 --> 00:26:31,334
to fund the English Crown.

336
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:34,334
He stole the treasure, kept it for himself.

337
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:37,733
He buried it. No one knows where.

338
00:26:38,934 --> 00:26:41,467
Thirty years ago, I bought this letter

339
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:45,434
from a backstreet antique dealer on
Crete who didn't know what he had.

340
00:26:45,568 --> 00:26:47,301
It was written by his first mate.

341
00:26:47,434 --> 00:26:51,267
It concerns three coins Drake had engraved

342
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,833
with the coordinates to his fortune.

343
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,100
The coins were kept in this coffer.

344
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:03,034
Thirty years I've searched for that.

345
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:07,000
A year ago, I found it on a shipwreck.

346
00:27:07,134 --> 00:27:10,167
And that's what's locked in the bank.

347
00:27:12,034 --> 00:27:14,601
Drake's motto was written on the chest:

348
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,100
<i>"Sic parvis magna."</i>

349
00:27:18,467 --> 00:27:20,501
"Great things from small things come."

350
00:27:20,634 --> 00:27:21,934
Mm-hmm.

351
00:27:22,067 --> 00:27:24,334
How great are the things that come?

352
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:26,201
Untold wealth.

353
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:29,501
But it's not about that. I have money.

354
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:31,301
Then why do you care?

355
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,401
I'm a hunter.

356
00:27:34,534 --> 00:27:36,467
I seek what to others is lost.

357
00:27:37,267 --> 00:27:38,767
We can't explain our passions.

358
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,767
- If we did...
- [people singing]

359
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,100
- Listen to that.
- [singing continues]

360
00:27:43,234 --> 00:27:47,301
A million people gathering to
cheer for men they don't know

361
00:27:47,434 --> 00:27:49,301
to put a ball in a net.

362
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:53,301
Unnecessary, unessential,

363
00:27:53,434 --> 00:27:54,934
but it means everything.

364
00:27:56,668 --> 00:27:58,167
That's passion.

365
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:04,067
[Walter] The Bank of Spain,

366
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:07,201
one of the most impenetrable
buildings on the planet.

367
00:28:07,334 --> 00:28:10,800
Every inch of the interior is
covered by cameras and sensors.

368
00:28:10,934 --> 00:28:13,234
Any unauthorized movement
brings the rapid fire

369
00:28:13,367 --> 00:28:15,967
of the 15 guards stationed within.

370
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,601
Across the street is the
headquarters of the Spanish army,

371
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:23,733
a garrison of 500, on alert
for any attacks on the city

372
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:25,434
or any attempts on the bank.

373
00:28:25,568 --> 00:28:28,534
If that wasn't enough, Gustavo
Medina, chief of security.

374
00:28:28,668 --> 00:28:31,134
Former head of Spain's
anti-terrorist task force.

375
00:28:31,267 --> 00:28:33,634
What we call here... [in Spanish]
The original son of a bitch.

376
00:28:33,767 --> 00:28:36,000
If he makes us, the job's off.

377
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:39,167
- How are you getting in?
- From below.

378
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:42,034
There's more tunnels under
Madrid than streets above.

379
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:44,334
James and Simon are mapping the route.

380
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:47,167
We're not there yet, but we're close.

381
00:28:47,301 --> 00:28:50,334
And this is supposed to be the vault?

382
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:53,367
This was a sketch done by an ex-employee

383
00:28:53,501 --> 00:28:56,334
who was in the vault for
a few minutes in 1944.

384
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:57,867
And this?

385
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,700
[Walter] It's some sort of engraving.

386
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:05,000
They favored aesthetics in functional
architecture in the 19th century.

387
00:29:05,134 --> 00:29:06,501
[Simon] Catholic imagery.

388
00:29:06,634 --> 00:29:08,800
Probably a martyr. Very Spanish.

389
00:29:08,934 --> 00:29:10,601
[Walter] This is apparently a bridge,

390
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:13,334
and that gives us access to the vault door.

391
00:29:13,467 --> 00:29:18,000
That requires two actual keys
and Gustavo Medina's thumbprint.

392
00:29:18,134 --> 00:29:20,668
Claudia Valenti, our art expert,

393
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,234
whom you've met, will take care of it.

394
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:25,900
Sounds like you've got it covered.

395
00:29:26,034 --> 00:29:28,000
[scoffs] Not even close.

396
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:31,833
The vault is safety-rigged,
but we don't know how.

397
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:35,733
If we don't shut down the
fail-safe when we enter the vault...

398
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:38,100
we're not coming out.

399
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:44,800
That's the miracle of engineering
that you need to identify and solve.

400
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,867
Can I see the actual vault?

401
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,634
I can't control the
cameras yet, only watch.

402
00:29:51,767 --> 00:29:53,434
Not till tomorrow.

403
00:29:53,568 --> 00:29:56,100
We'll also have a better idea of
what the vault looks like then.

404
00:29:56,234 --> 00:29:57,967
We're gonna take a magnetometer read.

405
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,767
Wait, you're going in there tomorrow?

406
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,067
Stage one.

407
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:05,867
[ringing]

408

[announcer speaking Spanish on TV]

409
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:09,819
[in Spanish] This is the
Integrated Cleaning Services.

410
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,418
[Simon on phone] Good evening. This is the
maintenance department of the Bank of Spain.

411
00:30:12,499 --> 00:30:13,301
Yes?

412
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:16,458
We're having some problems with the
alarms that are annoying people here.

413
00:30:16,562 --> 00:30:19,144
We need to cancel your
cleaning time slot for tomorrow.

414
00:30:19,305 --> 00:30:21,217
Very well. How about
the day after tomorrow?

415
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,153
We don't know yet. We'll
call you back, okay?

416
00:30:24,282 --> 00:30:25,131
Okay, no problem.

417
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:27,703
[announcer continues
in Spanish on speakers]

418
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:28,779
It's ready.

419
00:30:29,722 --> 00:30:30,955
What do you think about it?

420
00:30:34,111 --> 00:30:35,364
It's perfect.

421
00:30:36,492 --> 00:30:37,662
As always.

422
00:30:47,568 --> 00:30:49,201
[tuning frequency]

423
00:30:50,189 --> 00:30:51,295
[announcer speaking Spanish on radio]

424
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:53,760
...passes it on to Villa. The
referee looks at his watch...

425
00:30:53,892 --> 00:30:55,915
...and it's the final whistle!

426
00:30:56,017 --> 00:30:59,507
The spectators are going crazy!

427
00:30:59,634 --> 00:31:01,934
[cheering]

428
00:31:03,534 --> 00:31:05,767
[cheering continues]

429
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:10,467
[James] We have to postpone
and find a replacement.

430
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:12,634
[Walter] We don't have
time. Too much of a risk.

431
00:31:12,767 --> 00:31:14,201
Going in now is the risk.

432
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:16,100
If you're getting nervous,
you need to tell me.

433
00:31:16,234 --> 00:31:19,501
Doing it right isn't a
question of nerve, Walter.

434
00:31:19,634 --> 00:31:22,867
- What's going on?
- [Klaus] The security uses Interpol's face rec.

435
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,301
James was special forces,
so he is on the database.

436
00:31:26,434 --> 00:31:28,167
The system will bust him.

437
00:31:28,301 --> 00:31:30,234
- I'm going in his place.
- You don't know how to use the equipment.

438
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:34,100
- Teach me how to use it.
- Teach you how to use a magnetometer overnight?

439
00:31:34,234 --> 00:31:38,167
[chuckles] And then Klaus can
teach you code over breakfast.

440
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,434
I can do it.

441
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,301
[scoffs] Of course you can, Cambridge.

442
00:31:48,434 --> 00:31:49,867
I know how to use it.

443
00:31:52,334 --> 00:31:53,800
I'm an engineer.

444
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,800
Yesterday you're a student.

445
00:31:57,934 --> 00:32:01,100
Today you're brainstorming
for a complete stranger.

446
00:32:01,234 --> 00:32:04,167
And tomorrow you're a
criminal. Is that right?

447
00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:09,434
Thom will do it.

448
00:32:47,057 --> 00:32:48,645
[in Spanish] - How are you?
- Fine.

449
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:53,918
It's just you two?

450
00:32:54,343 --> 00:32:56,385
Just be glad we're here.

451
00:32:56,722 --> 00:33:00,110
With the World Cup going
on, everyone calls in sick.

452
00:33:07,148 --> 00:33:09,326
The game with Paraguay
wasn't easy yesterday.

453
00:33:09,543 --> 00:33:12,793
With that already being difficult, we
don't stand a chance against Germany.

454
00:33:13,097 --> 00:33:14,200
You'll see.

455
00:33:17,321 --> 00:33:20,357
You know what's funny? It was the
English who invented football...

456
00:33:20,434 --> 00:33:23,102
...but in the end, it's
Germany that always wins.

457
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:25,657
Says who?

458
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:30,434
[in English] Gary Lineker. [chuckles]

459

[engine starts]

460
00:33:31,997 --> 00:33:33,465
[in Spanish] I prefer our own Torres.

00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:35,334
[laughs]

462
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:37,104
Torres, he says.

Gustavo Medina, head of security.

469
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:18,234
[in Italian] Pleased to meet you.

470
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,034
[in English] Is it your scanner?

471
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:24,934
No. Scanner is for reproductions.

472
00:34:25,067 --> 00:34:27,167
This has an ultraviolet light

473
00:34:27,301 --> 00:34:31,067
that traces any imperfections
in the paintings for insurance.

474
00:34:31,377 --> 00:34:32,676
[in Italian] You want to see it?

475
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:35,367
[man in English] Gustavo.

476
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:37,800
That's okay, Miss Valenti. Muñoz
will take care of you from here.

477
00:34:37,934 --> 00:34:39,167
Miss Valenti, Mr. Muñoz.

00:34:39,301 --> 00:34:41,367
- Pleased to meet you.
- Could you...

479
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:43,601
- Sure.
- [in Italian] Pleased to meet you.

480
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:45,867
[in English] This way.

481
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:47,434
Oh.

482
00:34:47,568 --> 00:34:49,800
- [in Italian] Thank you.
- You're welcome.

- [Muñoz] Please.

484
00:35:01,668 --> 00:35:03,867
[Walter] <i>Thom, you're
doing a great job.</i>

485
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,434
Now I want you to head
to the basement level.

486
00:35:09,434 --> 00:35:10,733
[beeps]

487
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:33,601
Okay, Simon. At the end of
the hall, the door on the left.

488
00:35:33,733 --> 00:35:35,201
Just hold on, hold on.

489
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:36,501
Hold on.

490
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:39,301
Okay, camera's off. Ninety seconds. Go.

491
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,733
[humming]

492
00:35:57,234 --> 00:35:59,034
Is it your first time in Madrid?

493
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:00,534
Mm-hmm. Yes.

494
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,767
[Klaus] <i>Simon, hurry up. Lorraine
is almost at the chairman's office.</i>

495
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:09,867
[Simon] I've got it.

496
00:36:12,668 --> 00:36:14,733
Done. Did it work?

497
00:36:19,367 --> 00:36:23,434
Yes! The security system is now our bitch.

498
00:36:24,501 --> 00:36:27,967
Okay, so the monitors on the
left is what Gustavo sees,

499
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,100
and the right side is our
focus, what's really happening.

500
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,833
Here is Lorraine.

501
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:36,733
- Please.
- Thank you.

502
00:36:37,334 --> 00:36:38,501
Here it is.

503
00:36:38,634 --> 00:36:40,534
Our most valuable Goya.

504
00:36:40,668 --> 00:36:43,201
[Lorraine] Wow! [in Italian]
The Marquess of Tolosa.

505
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:44,668
Yes.

506
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:49,167
Well, if you need
something, extension 2871.

507
00:36:49,301 --> 00:36:50,767
Thank you.

508
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:08,966
- Lorraine, can you hear me?
- [Lorraine] <i>Yes.</i>

509
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,201
Okay. Let's record the loop.

510
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:17,900
Twenty seconds. Don't breathe.
Wait until the camera switches.

511
00:37:18,534 --> 00:37:20,067
Go.

512
00:37:22,634 --> 00:37:24,134
Recording.

513
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:28,234
<i>Stop. Pretend you've seen
something in the picture.</i>

514
00:37:29,967 --> 00:37:31,700
<i>Okay, keep scanning.</i>

515
00:37:32,234 --> 00:37:33,267
Still recording.

516
00:37:34,601 --> 00:37:36,800
Got it. We will put it in slo-mo.

517
00:37:38,668 --> 00:37:40,900
The loop has been launched.

518
00:37:41,034 --> 00:37:43,301
Two and a half minutes. Go.

519
00:38:05,804 --> 00:38:09,456
[in Spanish] - It's amazing, no?
- A Goya is always amazing.

520
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:11,212
Yeah, sure, but I meant...

521
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,791
You and your sense of humor.
I'll understand it one day.

522
00:38:18,593 --> 00:38:19,426
We'll see about that.

523
00:38:24,634 --> 00:38:28,067
[Walter] <i>Great, Lorraine.
Let's go for that key. Fast.</i>

524
00:38:32,401 --> 00:38:34,000
[sighs]

525
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,334
[Klaus] <i>All right, Thom.</i>

526
00:38:36,467 --> 00:38:38,867
Ten meters to your left, there's a door.

527
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,934
Get closer while I prepare the loop.

528
00:38:48,234 --> 00:38:50,900
[Lorraine] Scanning first key.

529
00:38:51,034 --> 00:38:52,767
[Klaus] <i>Just wait. Hold on.</i>

530
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:57,100
Camera is on loop. Get inside. Go.

531
00:39:05,267 --> 00:39:07,767
Thom, you're right above the vault pit.

532
00:39:09,634 --> 00:39:10,967
[grunts]

533
00:39:13,467 --> 00:39:14,401
[beeps]

534
00:39:14,534 --> 00:39:17,100
[whirring]

535
00:39:17,234 --> 00:39:18,568
Okay.

536
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,201
<i>It works.</i>

537
00:39:20,334 --> 00:39:23,000
[Lorraine] Done. First key copied.

538
00:39:31,334 --> 00:39:34,401
- [Klaus] <i>Lorraine, someone is coming.</i>
- [man coughs]

539
00:39:34,534 --> 00:39:38,867
I'm not sure what this has to do with
your coming exhibit, Miss Valenti.

540
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,034
I cannot place the artist.

541
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:43,401
<i>Eating Breakfast in Salamanca.</i>

542
00:39:43,534 --> 00:39:44,467
It's my wife.

543
00:39:44,601 --> 00:39:46,034
[both chuckle]

544
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:49,000
- Mariano Bellido, chairman of the bank.
- Claudia.

545
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:54,601
Beautiful small talk, Lorraine,

546
00:39:54,733 --> 00:39:58,034
but if you're not back in the same
position in 20 seconds, we are screwed.

547
00:39:58,167 --> 00:39:59,800
[chuckles]

548
00:39:59,934 --> 00:40:02,534
This is embarrassing. I was wondering...

549
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,934
could you take a picture of me scanning it?

550
00:40:06,434 --> 00:40:07,867
Oh, of course.

551
00:40:10,401 --> 00:40:12,900
[Klaus] Now, put your
left hand an inch left.

552
00:40:13,034 --> 00:40:13,900
Yep.

553
00:40:14,034 --> 00:40:16,134
And get the chairman out of the shot.

554
00:40:17,267 --> 00:40:20,267
[in Spanish]

555
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:22,634
Can you take one from the doorway?

556
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:26,833
- I want to feel the grandeur of your palatial office.
- [laughs]

557
00:40:29,668 --> 00:40:31,234
Six seconds. He's still in shot.

558
00:40:31,367 --> 00:40:33,900
- [Mariano] Beautiful.
- [Lorraine in Italian] Thank you.

559
00:40:34,534 --> 00:40:37,700
Three, two...

560
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:40,034
[in English] A little further back?

561
00:40:52,568 --> 00:40:54,067
It's impressive, huh?

562
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:57,234
And it will stay that way if
you stop smoking around it.

563
00:40:57,367 --> 00:40:58,833
Oh.

564
00:40:59,634 --> 00:41:02,934
You could see that from the scan?

565
00:41:03,067 --> 00:41:05,700
- And from the air freshener.
- [chuckles]

566
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:07,134
And the disabled window lock.

567
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:10,934
- Well...
- Don't worry. I will not mention it.

568
00:41:11,067 --> 00:41:12,900
[chuckles] Thank you.

569
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,367
[Klaus] Good, Lorraine.
Go for the other key.

570
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:21,034
- Shit.
- [in German] Shit.

571
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:24,467
Fuck. Thom, you've got company.

572
00:41:28,267 --> 00:41:31,000
[chattering]

573
00:41:39,867 --> 00:41:42,167
Break up the magnetometer,
hide it in your clothes,

574
00:41:42,301 --> 00:41:45,100
and walk out of the room as
though you've been cleaning it.

575
00:41:45,234 --> 00:41:47,767
- We need to abort.
- No. We won't get a second chance.

576
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,733
[chattering continues]

577
00:41:49,919 --> 00:41:53,577
[in Spanish] The first topic of the day:

578
00:41:53,724 --> 00:41:56,606
it was brought to our attention that...

579
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,234
The other Goya.

580
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,434
Take all the time you need.

581
00:42:05,568 --> 00:42:09,700
- Can I help you with anything else?
- No, thank you.

582
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:11,100
Okay, then.

583
00:42:12,367 --> 00:42:15,201
[Klaus] <i>Okay, Lorraine. Gustavo
isn't on you yet. Scan fast.</i>

584
00:42:18,148 --> 00:42:21,565
[in Spanish] Yesterday, we discussed
July and December operations.

585
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:26,041
The development process of
assets' index is stable...

586
00:42:33,234 --> 00:42:35,167
[beeping]

587
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:37,401
[stops whirring]

588
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:42,551
So the bank can move forward with
the investment of 211 million...

589
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,733
<i>Scheiße!</i> It's frozen.

590
00:42:43,867 --> 00:42:46,100
- Fix it.
- [exhales]

591
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:51,201
- Thom can surge the power, but...
- The pulse will trigger the alarm.

592
00:42:53,733 --> 00:42:55,167

[alarm blaring]

595
00:43:01,322 --> 00:43:03,555
- It's the fire alarm.
- Quick, get out.

596
00:43:08,344 --> 00:43:09,502
[in Spanish] Attention, everyone.

597
00:43:10,301 --> 00:43:11,922
- [computers beeping]
- Where is it, Muñoz?

598
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,031
The vault.

599
00:43:13,067 --> 00:43:16,767
[in English] What the fuck
is that? Fifty seconds left.

600
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:19,155
[in Spanish] Close the perimeter.

601
00:43:19,268 --> 00:43:20,826
You go to the vault.

602
00:43:21,887 --> 00:43:24,471
Nobody comes in or goes
out without my permission!

603
00:43:24,675 --> 00:43:26,793
[guard] Come on, move it.

604
00:43:29,303 --> 00:43:30,742
[guard 2] Step aside! Step aside!

605
00:43:30,986 --> 00:43:34,200
Second battalion, right flank!

- [sirens wailing]
- [helicopter whirring]

607

[alarm blaring continues]

608
00:43:40,134 --> 00:43:43,134
Chairman's on his way. Two seconds.

609
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,800
Miss Valenti, this way. Come with me.

610
00:43:49,934 --> 00:43:52,134
[man on PA speaking Spanish]

611
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,267
The building's on lockdown. They're
moving everybody to the foyer.

612
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,501
Big problem.

613
00:43:59,634 --> 00:44:02,100
The safe is still open
and the key's in my hand.

614
00:44:03,467 --> 00:44:06,334
- Miss Valenti! This way, please.
- Thank you.

615
00:44:06,467 --> 00:44:08,367
Well, I'm calling it. Time to panic.

616
00:44:08,501 --> 00:44:12,234
Simon, I need you to go to
the comptroller's office.

617
00:44:12,367 --> 00:44:16,434
[man on PA in Spanish] <i>Please,
remain inside the building...</i>

618
00:44:16,568 --> 00:44:19,334
[in English] That's a
problem. I'm in the foyer.

619
00:44:22,334 --> 00:44:23,367
I'm not.

620
00:44:24,601 --> 00:44:26,000
Where are you, Thom?

621
00:44:26,134 --> 00:44:30,134
Bottom of the stairs.
What do you need me to do?

622
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,000
How's your catching arm?

623
00:44:34,334 --> 00:44:35,301
Absolutely terrible.

624
00:44:35,434 --> 00:44:36,934
Lorraine is going to throw you a key,

625
00:44:37,067 --> 00:44:38,900
and you're going to have to catch it.

626
00:44:39,034 --> 00:44:43,134
<i>There's no margin for error. If it
hits the floor, we're all screwed.</i>

627
00:44:45,534 --> 00:44:47,201
Lorraine, on three.

628
00:44:47,334 --> 00:44:48,800
<i>Two.</i>

629
00:44:49,534 --> 00:44:51,301
One. Now.

630
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:56,267
<i>Good job.</i>

631
00:44:57,467 --> 00:45:00,301
- [Thom] <i>Now what?</i>
- Okay, Thom, turn left 15 meters.

632
00:45:00,434 --> 00:45:03,434
<i>You will find the back
stairs. Go up. Third floor.</i>

633
00:45:03,568 --> 00:45:05,234
Third door along.

634
00:45:09,568 --> 00:45:12,334
Thom, there's a guard
approaching. You've got to hide!

635
00:45:17,153 --> 00:45:18,879
[in Spanish] What are you doing here?

636
00:45:19,937 --> 00:45:25,744
[in Spanish] You scared me. I didn't hear
the alarm because I had my earbuds on.

637
00:45:25,901 --> 00:45:27,009
You have to get out of here quickly.

638
00:45:28,472 --> 00:45:29,430
Come on.

639
00:45:29,767 --> 00:45:32,967
Thom, if you have any other hidden talents,

640
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,067
could you please let us know?

641
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,334
The kid's got balls.

642
00:45:38,975 --> 00:45:40,767
[in Spanish] What the hell is going on?

643
00:45:41,107 --> 00:45:43,789
[Muñoz on phone] Nothing, Gustavo,
the basement is completely empty.

644
00:45:44,278 --> 00:45:46,098
The alarm doesn't go off on its own.

645
00:45:46,216 --> 00:45:48,216
I think there was a power outage.

646
00:45:48,575 --> 00:45:51,578
If it's okay with you,
I want to let people go.

647
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:02,867
[Thom] This is the
ground floor of the bank.

648
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,568
This is a few hundred
feet of earth and rock,

649
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,634
and then this part... soft,
wavy lines, out of focus...

650
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:10,833
this is the vault.

651
00:46:10,967 --> 00:46:13,934
And then an empty chamber below it.

652
00:46:14,067 --> 00:46:16,100
The model's all hard lines, precision.

653
00:46:16,234 --> 00:46:19,367
I just don't understand
why this part isn't.

654
00:46:19,501 --> 00:46:20,934
Maybe the scanner shifted.

655
00:46:21,067 --> 00:46:22,534
No. Below it's solid.

656
00:46:22,668 --> 00:46:25,733
The scanner just can't figure
out what to put in focus.

657
00:46:32,267 --> 00:46:33,900
Water.

658
00:46:36,234 --> 00:46:38,800
It's a tank of water. The soft part.

659
00:46:38,934 --> 00:46:41,367
The vault sits under a tank of water.

660
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,034
Shit. He's right.

661
00:46:48,167 --> 00:46:49,267
Explain.

662
00:46:49,401 --> 00:46:50,767
The water is the trap.

663
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,334
The tank funnels through these
pipes here, flooding the vault.

664
00:46:53,467 --> 00:46:55,601
But that doesn't stop someone robbing it.

665
00:46:55,733 --> 00:46:57,534
You could swim in. Or scuba.

666
00:46:57,668 --> 00:47:01,234
No. Because of the empty
chamber. Under the vault.

667
00:47:01,367 --> 00:47:03,067
You see these teeth here, either side?

668
00:47:03,201 --> 00:47:06,568
That's an actuator. Gears.
Rack-and-pinion gears.

669
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:10,267
When the vault floods, the whole
thing sinks down into the chamber.

670
00:47:10,401 --> 00:47:13,833
And if it's in the chamber,
no one gets in or out.

671
00:47:13,967 --> 00:47:15,800
But what makes it sink? What triggers it?

672
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:17,334
[Simon] Lasers, maybe.

673
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,401
- Motion.
- No, too modern.

674
00:47:19,534 --> 00:47:23,833
Whatever it is, it was
designed 70 years ago.

675
00:47:31,134 --> 00:47:32,167
Hang on.

676
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:47,601
It's been in front of you the whole time.

677
00:47:47,733 --> 00:47:49,000
The engraving.

678
00:47:49,668 --> 00:47:51,301
It's not a martyr.

679
00:47:51,434 --> 00:47:52,668
Justice.

680
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,034
Exactly. Lady Justice.

681
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:57,301
[James] So?

682
00:47:57,434 --> 00:47:58,700
So, when they built this,

683
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:00,434
they didn't have sensors
or motion detectors,

684
00:48:00,568 --> 00:48:02,100
but they did have scales.

685
00:48:02,234 --> 00:48:05,167
If there's the slightest
change of weight in the vault,

686
00:48:05,301 --> 00:48:07,201
the whole thing floods and sinks.

687
00:48:07,334 --> 00:48:11,668
And if you're inside, the
vault dispenses its own justice.

688
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,900
It drowns you, the vault.

689
00:48:15,034 --> 00:48:16,201
The miracle of engineering.

690
00:48:16,334 --> 00:48:18,700
It's one giant weighing scale.

691
00:48:19,934 --> 00:48:21,733
And it's genius.

692
00:48:21,867 --> 00:48:25,467
A giant scales. So what's the solution?

693
00:48:26,301 --> 00:48:27,833
I don't know.

694
00:48:27,967 --> 00:48:30,000
But we know what the problem is.

695
00:48:32,648 --> 00:48:33,923
[man in Spanish] Are you happy now?

696
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:38,922
"Spanish soldiers scare
the hell out of tourists."

697
00:48:39,508 --> 00:48:41,281
We just followed protocol.

698
00:48:41,406 --> 00:48:44,739
Think before you involve the
army during the World Cup.

699
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:46,996
And for what? A simple power outage.

700
00:48:47,857 --> 00:48:49,505
I am not so sure about that.

701
00:48:50,216 --> 00:48:53,886
Haven't you seen what's outside?
The TV screens? The generators?

702
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:57,445
- I have. We need to take them away.
- I already thought about that.

703
00:48:58,513 --> 00:49:00,222
The semi-final is in a few days.

704
00:49:00,317 --> 00:49:02,519
Enough time to move that
playground elsewhere.

705
00:49:02,643 --> 00:49:05,518
People can watch it in a pub, as always.

706
00:49:05,825 --> 00:49:08,581
Gustavo, they won't move the TV screens.

707
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:11,035
Football is everything.

708
00:49:51,934 --> 00:49:54,668
Fuck. Another dead end.

709
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,034
We're only 30 meters away.

710
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:58,201
[sighs]

711
00:50:01,501 --> 00:50:02,434
Wait.

[rumbling in distance]

00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:05,367

Support structure.

719
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:12,067
[James] Kid was right.

720
00:51:13,267 --> 00:51:14,700
It is a scale.

721
00:51:17,034 --> 00:51:19,334
We must be directly under the vault.

722
00:51:23,201 --> 00:51:25,434
The pit must be over there.

723
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,967
[shutter clicking]

Oh, shit.

727
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,301
We're fucked.

and a Dyneema shell.

733
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:17,134
What does that mean?

734
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:19,167
To drill through this wall
to the pit will take 15 days.

735
00:52:19,301 --> 00:52:20,800
We have eight. Use a bigger drill.

736
00:52:20,934 --> 00:52:22,867
I'm not bargaining with you, Walter.

737
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,067
At 800 psi, this wall will take 15 days.

738
00:52:27,201 --> 00:52:30,167
Drill harder, and we trigger the alarm.

739
00:52:33,867 --> 00:52:35,767

That's it? We're done?

00:52:48,967 --> 00:52:51,733
We're not gonna try and
figure out another way?

744
00:52:51,867 --> 00:52:54,134
Walter will pay you for your time.

745
00:52:54,934 --> 00:52:57,800
Sorry you wasted five days of your life.

00:53:53,634 --> 00:53:57,201
[Simon] Walter, if I'm not gonna be
rich, I could at least watch the game.

751
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:58,934
Simon, come here.

752
00:54:00,301 --> 00:54:03,267
We can't break in from below,
but we can break in from above.

753
00:54:03,401 --> 00:54:05,601
[James] Walter, we spent weeks
mapping the route from above.

754
00:54:05,733 --> 00:54:09,000
We abandoned it because there's too
much exposure from the CCTV cameras.

755
00:54:09,134 --> 00:54:12,334
Except when Spain plays
its World Cup games.

756
00:54:12,467 --> 00:54:14,634
When the crowd gathers in Cibeles Square,

757
00:54:14,767 --> 00:54:18,934
every camera will be pointing away
from the building, toward the crowd.

758
00:54:19,067 --> 00:54:20,967
It'll be like that for the final,

759
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:24,967
which gives us 105 minutes
to get the job done.

760
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,100
This is your route, James.

761
00:54:27,234 --> 00:54:30,301
From the Zurich building, through
the dome, through the vents.

762
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:31,534
Is that still viable?

763
00:54:32,534 --> 00:54:35,800
If the cameras are pointing
at the crowd, not the bank,

764
00:54:35,934 --> 00:54:39,767
then yeah, the route is viable.

765
00:54:40,634 --> 00:54:44,201
So everything depends on this match?

766
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:45,934
Yeah.

I just wanted to remind you
that we've still got a problem.

772
00:55:03,334 --> 00:55:04,367
My problem.

773
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:06,833
The scale.

774
00:55:06,967 --> 00:55:08,867
I'm still no closer to finding a solution,

775
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,733
and the final is four days away now,

776
00:55:10,867 --> 00:55:12,934
half the time I was meant to have.

777
00:55:13,067 --> 00:55:16,534
Well, I have every faith
that Spain will get there.

778
00:55:16,668 --> 00:55:18,867
And I have every faith in you.

[in English] Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

00:56:12,851 --> 00:56:14,911
[in Spanish] Any intention
of emptying these bins?

793
00:56:15,464 --> 00:56:17,567
We weren't allowed in for two days.

794
00:56:18,109 --> 00:56:19,738
And now we are getting complaints.

795
00:56:20,747 --> 00:56:23,181
The day before yesterday,
there were two cleaners here.

796
00:56:24,336 --> 00:56:28,514
Weren't ours. You canceled on
us. And now you're saying...

797
00:56:50,134 --> 00:56:52,301
Drink that, and you won't sleep.

798
00:56:53,334 --> 00:56:55,733
I'm drinking it so I won't sleep.

00:56:57,034 --> 00:56:58,900
You've been awake 43 hours.

You won't figure it out if
you break down with exhaustion.

I put my faith in him.

00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,967
You've put fear in him.

806
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,634
Think what it will do to him if he fails.

807
00:57:38,767 --> 00:57:41,967
- He'll take a job with GranCo Oil.
- Not if he does have an idea.

808
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,000
What if he does and it fails?

809
00:57:45,134 --> 00:57:47,201
He won't be anywhere near it.

810
00:57:47,334 --> 00:57:50,367
But we will. And that's
a risk we agreed to take.

811
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:53,034
But you're asking him to
put our lives in his hands.

812
00:57:53,167 --> 00:57:57,100
Every voyage, every salvage, every dive,

813
00:57:57,234 --> 00:58:00,867
we all ask the crew to take each
other's lives in their hands.

He's not your crew.

He's a college kid.

You're worried about him
because he's a college kid?

Neither the police, nor the Civil
Guard have any files on them...

We are. And now we know who they are.

What are they after? Gold?

828

It would be impossible
because of the weight.

829

Too heavy.

They are sealed until the
Ministry investigates them.

Okay.

- Simon?
- I've never even had a parking ticket.

If it wasn't for my birth certificate,
there'd be no proof I even exist.

[Walter] Then an image

What's going on?

843
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,067
You fucked up when you surged the power,

00:59:30,201 --> 00:59:31,934
that's what's going on.

845
00:59:32,067 --> 00:59:34,501
Walter's right. We haven't been made.

We haven't been made?

847
00:59:36,467 --> 00:59:39,501
Gustavo Medina knows someone's
after the vault. The place is a trap.

848
00:59:39,634 --> 00:59:40,568
We can monitor the trap.

Walter's right.

[mocking] "Walter's right."

Are you capable of having
a thought of your own?

852
00:59:45,401 --> 00:59:48,733
Yes. When I agreed to do
this job, just like you.

853
00:59:48,867 --> 00:59:53,000
Since then, all I've heard
from you are reasons to run.

Why did you come aboard?

Yeah? To whom?

Stop.

James, we go on with the plan.

They know we want to get
in, but not how we'll do it.

how to crack that scale.

Yes, but I prefer we

The ship left America at the time...

865
01:00:28,888 --> 01:00:31,041
...with a cargo of gold and
silver, and then it sank.

866
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:34,142
Total value of the cargo?

867
01:00:34,265 --> 01:00:37,112
15 to 20 million. Maybe more.

If this is what it seems like, we
are not talking about 20 million.

It's worth more than that.

But those two men who entered with fake

It is not a coincidence
that they came 3 days ago.

The country's state gives
them the perfect diversion.

They will be coming when everyone's

We need to double up the security.
And close Cibeles, Prado and Alcalá.

If we do that, we will have a

01:18:08,797 --> 01:18:12,797
The next person that talks
about football is fired.

1123
01:18:12,963 --> 01:18:15,963
People are excited, no point
in making them any more nervous.

1124
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:19,130
Don't fuck around, Muñoz, focus!

1125
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:32,833
Fuck!

1126
01:18:32,967 --> 01:18:34,167
They're two minutes behind.

1127
01:18:34,301 --> 01:18:36,800
- Why is that happening?
- Thom is slowing them.

1128
01:18:47,130 --> 01:18:49,380
[announcer in Spanish]
End of the first half!

1129
01:18:49,505 --> 01:18:54,047
Spain 0, Netherlands 0!

1130
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,867
Okay, guys, it's halftime.
Sixty minutes to get out.

1131
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,867
<i>We're ten minutes late.</i>

1132
01:19:12,963 --> 01:19:15,797
- [Gustavo on phone in Spanish] Yes, sir?
- Have we been robbed yet?

1133
01:19:15,833 --> 01:19:16,718
[chuckles]

1134
01:19:16,754 --> 01:19:17,963
No, Mr. Director.

1135
01:19:18,172 --> 01:19:20,213
Then they have to hurry,
the second half starts soon.

1136
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:24,130
0-0... but the Dutch are
ruling the game for now.

1137
01:19:25,367 --> 01:19:26,401
[beeps]

1138
01:19:29,505 --> 01:19:32,047
Check all the cameras and sensors again.

1139
01:19:37,172 --> 01:19:39,630
Did he say anything about the score?

1140
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:48,067
Clear to proceed in three.

[Walter] <i>We can see you again.</i>

1142
01:20:16,767 --> 01:20:19,501
It's 46 minutes until full time.

1143

<i>Let's go.</i>

And the second half begins!

1146
01:20:58,401 --> 01:20:59,934
Come on, Cambridge.

Thom!

Look at me.

You're good.

James, don't move. The back's slipping!

1156
01:22:02,467 --> 01:22:03,800
Stop!

1157
01:22:10,634 --> 01:22:11,934
How's that catching arm?

1158
01:22:12,833 --> 01:22:15,000
S-Still poor to quite poor.

1159

Thank you

1163

for saving my life, Thom.

1164
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:46,934
I'll buy you flowers.

1165
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:50,067
Klaus, the codes.

1166
01:22:50,201 --> 01:22:52,401
[Klaus] <i>Okay, the codes
change every 33 minutes.</i>

1167
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:55,034
We got six minutes before I
can try grabbing the next one.

1168
01:22:55,167 --> 01:22:58,434
- But you can grab them?
- That's the billion-dollar question.

1169
01:22:58,797 --> 01:23:01,547
[in German] You can do it, you can do it...

1170

- Six.
- Six.

Seven.

Seven.

1174
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:19,134
One. Just one more. How's my time?

1175
01:23:19,267 --> 01:23:20,800
Fifteen seconds.

1176
01:23:24,568 --> 01:23:26,167
- Ten.
- [muttering]

1177
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:29,767
Klaus, if we don't get these,
we have to wait 31 minutes.

1178
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:31,934
Come on, baby.

1179

Four! It's four! Jesus! [exhales]

Taking far too much time.

01:26:08,733 --> 01:26:11,601
Simon, how many liters have you used?

1193

[Simon] <i>Eighty percent.</i>

Twenty left.

1195
01:26:20,668 --> 01:26:22,334
Should it have worked by now?

1196
01:26:24,167 --> 01:26:25,434
Yeah.

1197
01:26:27,568 --> 01:26:29,134
But it hasn't.

None. That's all of it.

[Walter] Fuck.

1229

[in Spanish] No, there is no opening.

No, no, we can't. There's
got to be another solution.

01:33:15,501 --> 01:33:18,568
It's over. I'm calling
the bank. They can stop it.

1285
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:19,833
[Thom] <i>There's no point.</i>

1286
01:33:19,967 --> 01:33:21,367
This thing is autonomous.

1287
01:33:21,501 --> 01:33:23,501
It won't stop until the vault's filled.

1288
01:33:23,634 --> 01:33:25,733

[gasping]

1290
01:34:00,501 --> 01:34:03,967
Thom, listen to me. There's
nothing we can do from here.

1291
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:05,967
You think we don't know that?

1292
01:34:13,234 --> 01:34:15,867
[gasping]

1293
01:34:17,601 --> 01:34:20,601
[Walter] <i>Thom, Lorraine, keep
calm. We'll get you out of there.</i>

1294
01:34:20,733 --> 01:34:23,634
You have around ten minutes before
you're submerged. Ten minutes.

1295
01:34:23,767 --> 01:34:25,967
- Okay. Okay!
- We have to get out!

1296
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:27,334
You studied the 3D model.

1297
01:34:27,467 --> 01:34:29,833
You know it. There has
to be a way, a route.

1298
01:34:29,967 --> 01:34:32,100
Okay! Okay, can everybody shut up?

1299
01:34:32,234 --> 01:34:36,000
Shut up! Shut up! I'm trying to think.

1300
01:34:39,334 --> 01:34:41,967
Okay. Okay, Thom. Let's keep it simple.

1301
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:43,934
Basic laws of physics.

1302
01:34:44,067 --> 01:34:45,934
The water will stop coming
when the vault's full.

1303
01:34:46,067 --> 01:34:48,867
It has to, otherwise the
pressure would burst the vault.

1304
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,301
Great. But that won't save us.

1305
01:34:54,167 --> 01:34:57,000
There's no sensors in here
to detect the water level,

1306
01:34:57,134 --> 01:34:59,800
so how does it know when to shut off?

1307
01:35:03,733 --> 01:35:05,234
The weight.

1308
01:35:05,367 --> 01:35:08,334
The weight. The weight!

1309
01:35:08,467 --> 01:35:09,700
Simon!

- <i>Are you still down there?</i>
- Yeah, sure.

1311
01:35:13,034 --> 01:35:16,467
Okay, pile as much weight
as you can onto the scale.

1312
01:35:16,601 --> 01:35:18,000
<i>Come on, please!</i>

1313
01:35:18,668 --> 01:35:19,967

into thinking the vault's full.</i>

1318
01:35:29,367 --> 01:35:31,967
It's all about the scale. It has to be.

01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:03,630
[in Spanish] The vault is filling
up, but we still don't see anything.

01:36:03,838 --> 01:36:05,505
- How is it going?
- [man on radio] I'm doing what I can.

[in German] Shit.

1331

out, the vault will be unlocked

No idea, sir. There is no body. Nothing.

They'll find them in five

[Lorraine] I told you
I don't want to get wet.

[Thom] So...

01:48:10,267 --> 01:48:13,867
you knew this whole time that James
was going to try and screw you?

I thought he might.

1450

He's a good man, but he
gave his loyalty to a flag,

Oh. I don't know.
