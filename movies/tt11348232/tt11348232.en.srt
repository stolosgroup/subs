3
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:22,429
Hey, honey.

4
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,931
What are you doing up?

5
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,969
Oh, I couldn't sleep.

6
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:29,871
I don't like the bed.

7
00:04:29,904 --> 00:04:31,338
Well, you better
get used to it,

8
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,074
it's only our first night here.

9
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:33,875
What about you?

10
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:35,710
Why are you up?

11
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,780
I couldn't sleep either.

12
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:40,548
Yeah.

13
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:42,917
Hey, you were gnawing your
teeth in your sleep again.

14
00:04:45,086 --> 00:04:45,920
Had another episode.

15
00:04:51,526 --> 00:04:53,027
Did you get connected
to the wifi?

16
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,097
No, nothing still,
I'm just looking at old posts.

17
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,065
Oh, I like that one there,
look.

18
00:04:58,099 --> 00:04:59,767
"Has your husband even grieved?

19
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,702
Is he even around?"

20
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:02,503
Trolls.

21
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,507
Aren't they your friends?

22
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,676
From high school,
like half a lifetime ago.

23
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:11,378
So what now, they suddenly
all become your therapist?

24
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,981
I know it sounds so
stupid, but if you were

25
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:16,984
on social media,
you'd understand.

26
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:19,020
Well, I value my privacy.

27
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:20,888
It's funny how that makes
me into some kind of maniac.

28
00:05:20,922 --> 00:05:21,989
Close.

29
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:23,691
You're in construction.

30
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:26,527
Well, I am a carpenter,
according to my old man.

31
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,030
Yeah.

32
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:32,700
I forgot, the religious
one in the family.

33
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,069
Listen,
I consider myself social,

34
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:37,038
just not in a media kind of way.

35
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:38,739
Do you want me to
go on social media?

36
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:39,907
I mean, would that help you?

37
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:47,048
Just forget about it.

38
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:47,949
I know who you are.

39
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:52,954
We're here for this.

40
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:53,754
What?

41
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:56,356
Just nothing.

42
00:05:58,993 --> 00:06:00,493
Which is exactly
what we're gonna do

43
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:02,395
the whole time we're here.

44
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,131
We're just gonna
let go of everything.

45
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,001
Okay?

46
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,368
You promised me.

47
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,908
Just breathe.

48
00:07:52,006 --> 00:07:52,673
Trust the harness.

49
00:07:52,707 --> 00:07:53,708
Oh my god!

50
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:54,542
Too late now!

51
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:57,878
Woo!

52
00:07:57,912 --> 00:08:00,114
Go, go, go, go!

53
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,750
Ah, go Jay!

54
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:22,236
Beautiful.

55
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:24,972
It's so pretty.

56
00:08:58,139 --> 00:08:59,173
Excuse me.

57
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,274
Yes, may I help you?

58
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:02,043
Hi, was this a prison?

59
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:03,677
Yes, it is.

60
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:04,912
Would you like to
hear her story?

61
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:05,746
Yes.

62
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,647
Yes, please.

63
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,182
Her name was Vo Thi Sau.

64
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,351
She was famous
about her bravery.

65
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:14,321
At 14 years old, she took arms
against the French soldier.

66
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:16,757
Wow, a teenage war hero.

67
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:18,759
That's amazing.

68
00:09:18,793 --> 00:09:19,727
Did she die here?

69
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,663
She was executed in 1952.

70
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,965
Her story is an
inspiration and make her

71
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:27,234
become a war hero in Vietnam.

72
00:09:27,268 --> 00:09:29,036
It's like Joan of Arc.

73
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,970
Thank you.

74
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,139
For good fortune.

75
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:54,695
Hello, hello.

76
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,979
Honey?

77
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:12,980
Hi, Mom.

78
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,115
Hi!

79
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:15,282
Can you hear me?

80
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:17,351
Yes, I can hear you.

81
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:19,353
How are you guys doing?

82
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:20,921
We're doing great.

83
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:22,256
Where are you?

84
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,692
At a beachside cafe in town.

85
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:25,659
You want to see?

86
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,261
Yes, I want to see.

87
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,029
Oh my god.

88
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:30,297
Is that Kyle?

89
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:32,333
He's playing soccer
with the waiters.

90
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:34,835
Uh-huh, yes, baby, I see you.

91
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:39,740
Such a goof.

92
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:40,975
Don't they have a job to do?

93
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:43,043
Well, it's the off season.

94
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:45,312
There's not a lot of tourists
for them to take care of.

95
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:46,280
Oh, that's good.

96
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,382
You beat the crowd.

97
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:49,950
It looks beautiful.

98
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:51,418
It certainly is.

99
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:52,920
Good.

100
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,790
Look who's here,
look who went away.

101
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,392
Logan, come
over here, say hi!

102
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:00,261
Quiet no more.

103
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:02,196
Hi, Lizzie.

104
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:03,397
Hey, Sis.

105
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,065
How's Vietnam?

106
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:09,103
Oh, it's, it's amazing so far.

107
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,738
I went parasailing.

108
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:11,272
Twice.

109
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:12,072
Wait, you?

110
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:13,774
No way.

111
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,442
I know, well, they
offered us a free ride, so.

112
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:17,478
Oh, it's 'cause
you guys are a hot-ass couple.

113
00:11:17,512 --> 00:11:19,313
That's right,
we are a hot-ass couple.

114
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,081
You guys have been
gone for three days.

115
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:22,316
I've been worried.

116
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,251
You said you would
call the first day.

117
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:26,153
I know, Mom.

118
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:29,857
There's no wifi in the room,
and it's really hard to get.

119
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,060
But did you get the
pictures that I sent you

120
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,728
just now of our hotel?

121
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:35,930
I did.

122
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:37,398
- Well, good.
- Wow, it's amazing.

123
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:39,200
Wait a minute, a
room above the water?

124
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:40,334
Is that safe?

125
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:44,338
Well, I hope, I guess.

126
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,407
It costs enough money.

127
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,275
No, why? Didn't you
say it's the low season?

128
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,046
Well, I still have
to watch my wallet.

129
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,781
I don't have a job
when I get home.

130
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:56,083
As a mother, I approve.

131
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,687
No woman should feel bad about
what you went through, baby.

132
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,891
Absolutely.

133
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:06,393
Hence, the amazing vacation.

134
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:08,295
Yeah.

135
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:10,965
I hope you realize how nice
it is of Kyle to do that?

136
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:12,800
I feel like most
guys would, you know,

137
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,202
go to happy hour and not plan
a whole vacation to Vietnam.

138
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:16,337
Yeah.

139
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,272
I was as surprised as you are.

140
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,041
I didn't see it coming.

141
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:23,177
Well, you guys need it.

142
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,446
It's never a bad decision
to take care of yourself,

143
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:26,180
or your marriage.

144
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:30,251
Wait, and no wifi?

145
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:32,219
I mean, for that price,
you guys should be getting,

146
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:34,488
at least HBO or something.

147
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:37,559
That's not the point, Lizzie,
it's a retreat for them.

148
00:12:37,592 --> 00:12:38,859
Just them, by themselves.

149
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:42,363
I'll take you
here sometime, Mom,

150
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:44,532
and Lizzie,
it'll be a girls' trip.

151
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:46,066
Oh, god.

152
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,334
That sounds so good.

153
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:48,802
Your dad says hello.

154
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:50,871
He's on his fifth
day of no carbs.

155
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,206
- Really?
- He's horrible.

156
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,341
Now I just need to get
the beer away from him.

157
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,577
Good luck with that!

158
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,111
Yeah.

159
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:01,148
How are you guys doing?

160
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:02,483
How is Kyle doing?

161
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:04,051
He's good.

162
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:05,219
He's really good.

163
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:06,820
We're doing really well.

164
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:07,855
Good.

165
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:08,422
Honey, it'll be okay.

166
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,390
You need this.

167
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,226
I miss you.

168
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,394
Oh, I miss you too.

169
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:15,095
You know I love you.

170
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:16,397
I can't stand this.

171
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,965
Let's get off.

172
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:19,333
But you guys have fun out there.

173
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:20,602
Just forget about everything.

174
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:21,368
- Just...
- Yeah, that's-

175
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,573
That's what Kyle
keeps telling me.

176
00:13:25,607 --> 00:13:27,341
Well, he needs you too, honey.

177
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:29,143
Come home to me soon, okay?

178
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:30,512
Get me something fun.

179
00:13:30,545 --> 00:13:32,179
That'll be my
first order of business.

180
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,314
I love you.

181
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:34,982
Love you, Mom.

182
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:44,224
- Bye!
- I love you.

183
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:45,192
Bye, sweetie.

184
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:45,893
Bye.

185
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:55,162
Honey, there's no signal here.

186
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:57,131
That SIM you got
in town is useless.

187
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:09,644
Oh!

188
00:15:09,677 --> 00:15:11,546
Oh my god, it's great.

189
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:12,680
I just, I'm trying to
get it on, I can't get on.

190
00:15:12,714 --> 00:15:15,115
Look, I can see all the fish!

191
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:15,949
So clear.

192
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:17,418
Honey, honey, hey!

193
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:18,520
Come on, just get rid of it.

194
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:19,521
It's not what we're here for.

195
00:15:19,554 --> 00:15:20,588
I just, I need a minute.

196
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:23,390
Come on.

197
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:25,426
Please, get in.

198
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:27,327
Let me help you,
you'll feel totally different.

199
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:28,462
Come on, we promised
we were just gonna

200
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:29,930
let go of everything, remember?

201
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,638
Besides, we paid a freakin'
fortune for this floating villa!

202
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:37,438
Come on.

203
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:42,409
All right.

204
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:43,110
Woo!

205
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,280
Hey, get me one too.

206
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:46,980
Got one.

207
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:52,386
No, no!

208
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,521
I hate you!

209
00:15:53,555 --> 00:15:54,656
Don't!

210
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:56,256
I'm gonna get in!

211
00:17:12,634 --> 00:17:13,400
God.

212
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:17,037
We should've done this sooner.

213
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:21,208
Ah, fuck, god damnit.

214
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:42,564
Honey.

215
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:46,568
I'm so sorry.

216
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:50,538
You know it's not your fault.

217
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:52,072
Honey, it's okay.

218
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,310
It's okay, it's not your fault.

219
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:58,713
It's gonna be okay.

220
00:18:00,615 --> 00:18:01,281
It's okay.

221
00:18:05,653 --> 00:18:07,354
You all right?

222
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,088
Mm-hmm.

223
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:11,224
It's just an episode.

224
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,127
Oh.

225
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,130
Sorry.

226
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:18,332
Maybe I shouldn't have
made you get in the water?

227
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:19,567
Just give me a minute.

228
00:18:19,601 --> 00:18:20,267
Yeah, yeah, of course.

229
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:30,645
Kind of stings.

230
00:18:30,678 --> 00:18:32,112
We should be wearing flippers.

231
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,849
You know, it's not your fault.

232
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:36,684
You know, none of it's
your fault, really.

233
00:18:36,718 --> 00:18:38,519
I'm sorry it happened,
I'm really sorry.

234
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:41,689
You don't have
to blame yourself.

235
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:47,528
Shouldn't have done it.

236
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:00,708
He would have died either way.

237
00:19:00,742 --> 00:19:01,876
It's not your fault.

238
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:03,711
Stop saying that.

239
00:19:03,745 --> 00:19:06,848
I hate it when people
say that, especially you.

240
00:19:06,881 --> 00:19:07,782
Sorry, I'm sorry.

241
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:11,151
God dammit, all that blood!

242
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:12,654
What?

243
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,256
Maybe she would have
lived if I hadn't bled.

244
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:16,858
Honey.

245
00:19:17,992 --> 00:19:19,761
It's not true, come on.

246
00:19:19,794 --> 00:19:21,529
It has nothing to do with
the water birth or the blood.

247
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:23,163
You came out of it alive.

248
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:27,234
We did everything we could.

249
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:30,303
We just, you hemorrhaged,
and then...

250
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:34,441
The baby didn't
have a heartbeat,

251
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,644
so, she didn't have a chance.

252
00:19:40,715 --> 00:19:43,183
No, it was me!

253
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:46,420
That's it, I strangled her!

254
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,791
No.

255
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:52,325
I was being stupid,
I didn't take care of myself!

256
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,529
I wasn't being safe.

257
00:19:54,562 --> 00:19:55,295
That's it.

258
00:19:56,631 --> 00:19:57,431
We failed her.

259
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:01,201
I don't know, I just don't know.

260
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:11,278
Baby?

261
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,917
How, how, how, can we...

262
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:18,786
Nothing.

263
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,593
- Just...
- No.

264
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:12,573
I can't stay here.

265
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:20,815
Yeah, this trip, it's
not gonna work out, is it?

266
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,385
I can't control it, I don't
know why, it just happens.

267
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,287
No, no, don't, it's okay.

268
00:21:29,624 --> 00:21:31,092
You don't have to
explain anything, honey.

269
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,929
I mean, from what I saw
today, from how you were,

270
00:21:36,898 --> 00:21:37,565
we're not staying.

271
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,333
Thank you.

272
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:41,669
We can leave in the morning.

273
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:43,436
Maybe the hotel will
give us our money back.

274
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:47,108
Hey, you know, you
don't have to worry.

275
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:48,943
I mean you can start
posting tomorrow

276
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:50,011
how great our trip was.

277
00:21:55,783 --> 00:21:57,484
Yeah.

278
00:21:57,518 --> 00:21:58,451
You wanna go to the bar?

279
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:05,827
Are we gonna be okay?

280
00:22:09,864 --> 00:22:10,531
I love you.

281
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:12,533
Here.

282
00:23:39,854 --> 00:23:40,922
What was that?

283
00:23:44,692 --> 00:23:46,493
Just the storm.

284
00:23:46,527 --> 00:23:47,862
Should we be worried?

285
00:23:49,764 --> 00:23:51,966
No, no, it's gonna pass
through, it's tropical.

286
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:53,067
Oh, it's tropical, yeah.

287
00:23:54,168 --> 00:23:56,938
Just go back to sleep.

288
00:24:02,043 --> 00:24:03,144
Hello?

289
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,518
Okay.

290
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:22,964
They say we can
relocate if we want.

291
00:24:22,997 --> 00:24:24,065
What?

292
00:24:24,098 --> 00:24:25,232
What'd she say about the storm?

293
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:26,667
That it's normal.

294
00:24:26,701 --> 00:24:28,235
She's just calling
to reassure us.

295
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:29,036
Wow.

296
00:24:31,572 --> 00:24:33,741
I don't think there's
anything to worry about.

297
00:24:33,774 --> 00:24:35,475
I mean, how do you feel?

298
00:24:36,877 --> 00:24:40,281
Um, well...

299
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:41,983
Should we move?

300
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:49,657
Okay.

301
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,092
No, we're okay, thank you.

302
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:52,927
Okay, good night.

303
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,966
You know, it's,
it's monsoon season.

304
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,035
I'm sure the hotel has
protocols and procedures

305
00:25:01,068 --> 00:25:02,603
in place for this kind of thing.

306
00:25:02,636 --> 00:25:03,771
Okay.

307
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:36,904
Kyle, wake up!

308
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:39,673
Oh my god.

309
00:25:47,982 --> 00:25:48,783
Kyle.

310
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,021
Hey!

311
00:25:57,224 --> 00:25:58,559
Oh, my leg.

312
00:26:03,931 --> 00:26:05,232
I can't.

313
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:08,836
Get to the phone, call
someone.

314
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:10,104
Okay.

315
00:26:22,283 --> 00:26:24,351
There's no dial tone.

316
00:26:24,385 --> 00:26:25,753
Dammit.

317
00:26:25,786 --> 00:26:26,787
It's dead. It's dead.

318
00:26:26,821 --> 00:26:27,755
I think I broke my leg.

319
00:26:27,788 --> 00:26:29,056
What? You broke your leg?

320
00:26:52,146 --> 00:26:53,080
Honey?

321
00:26:55,382 --> 00:26:56,183
Honey.

322
00:26:56,217 --> 00:26:58,052
Honey.

323
00:26:58,085 --> 00:26:58,752
Honey.

324
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:02,156
Honey, wake up!

325
00:27:02,189 --> 00:27:02,990
Honey!

326
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:05,092
Talk to me.

327
00:27:05,126 --> 00:27:05,893
Hey.

328
00:27:07,828 --> 00:27:08,395
Honey?

329
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:14,635
Honey.

330
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,204
Talk to me!

331
00:27:24,845 --> 00:27:25,846
Hey, talk to me!

332
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,151
Oh my god.

333
00:27:30,184 --> 00:27:31,185
What?

334
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:32,386
What is it?

335
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:34,922
Kyle, we're moving
away from land.

336
00:27:49,904 --> 00:27:52,306
Fuck!

337
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,140
Honey?

338
00:27:53,174 --> 00:27:53,974
Are you okay?

339
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:54,675
God!

340
00:27:57,178 --> 00:27:58,746
- God Dammit.
- Okay, okay.

341
00:28:00,381 --> 00:28:01,448
Hello, is anyone there?

342
00:28:01,482 --> 00:28:03,350
Do you see anyone?

343
00:28:03,384 --> 00:28:06,787
Babe, I see someone, I think,
I think they're here for us.

344
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:12,993
Help!

345
00:28:13,027 --> 00:28:15,162
Please, over here, we're here!

346
00:28:15,196 --> 00:28:16,197
Help!

347
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,431
Please!

348
00:28:17,464 --> 00:28:19,266
Help, over here!

349
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:23,370
Help!

350
00:28:23,404 --> 00:28:24,405
Help!

351
00:28:24,438 --> 00:28:26,207
- Hey!
- What?

352
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,841
We have to swim over to them,
we have to get off this thing.

353
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,210
- No.
- We're gonna lose them.

354
00:28:29,243 --> 00:28:30,444
Do they even know that
we're still out here?

355
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:32,179
I don't know what to do.

356
00:28:33,548 --> 00:28:35,282
I don't know what to do.

357
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:37,818
We gotta try.

358
00:28:37,851 --> 00:28:38,886
- No.
- Listen.

359
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:40,187
I don't think we can make it.

360
00:28:40,221 --> 00:28:41,155
It's gonna be okay,
we just have to try.

361
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:42,389
It's okay.

362
00:28:42,423 --> 00:28:44,258
No, you can't
make it, your leg!

363
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:46,193
Listen, I'm fine, I'm
gonna be okay, all right?

364
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:47,228
We have to try.

365
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:48,462
We have to, baby.

366
00:28:48,495 --> 00:28:49,763
We have to.

367
00:28:49,797 --> 00:28:50,998
I can't do it!

368
00:28:51,031 --> 00:28:51,966
Hey, trust me.

369
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:54,335
It's gonna be fine.

370
00:28:54,368 --> 00:28:56,203
Hey, look.

371
00:28:56,237 --> 00:28:57,972
Hey!

372
00:28:58,005 --> 00:28:58,739
Hey!

373
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,874
Hey!

374
00:29:04,878 --> 00:29:05,879
- Okay.
- Okay.

375
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:07,281
Here we go.

376
00:29:07,314 --> 00:29:08,115
Careful.

377
00:29:08,148 --> 00:29:08,916
Honey.

378
00:29:10,217 --> 00:29:11,318
Come on, come on!

379
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,924
Jay!

380
00:29:20,494 --> 00:29:22,363
Hold on, hold on.

381
00:29:22,396 --> 00:29:23,163
I got you.

382
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:25,432
Hey!

383
00:29:27,868 --> 00:29:29,236
Help!

384
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,304
Hey!

385
00:29:30,337 --> 00:29:32,106
Kyle, I'm slipping!

386
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:33,907
Oh my god.

387
00:29:42,182 --> 00:29:42,950
Come on!

388
00:29:54,261 --> 00:29:55,429
Oh shit.

389
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:57,064
Honey, I love you.

390
00:29:57,097 --> 00:29:58,533
Trust me.

391
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:09,009
Kyle, Kyle.

392
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:22,823
Kyle.

393
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,126
Kyle?

394
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:30,064
Kyle!

395
00:30:31,165 --> 00:30:32,399
Hey, hey.

396
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:33,100
- Hey.
- Thank god.

397
00:30:36,036 --> 00:30:36,837
You made it.

398
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:40,007
Okay.

399
00:30:43,243 --> 00:30:45,079
Oh, you're bleeding.

400
00:30:45,112 --> 00:30:46,413
Don't look at it.

401
00:30:46,447 --> 00:30:47,247
Don't...

402
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,484
- Oh.
- Don't look.

403
00:30:53,354 --> 00:30:54,021
Look.

404
00:30:55,422 --> 00:30:56,558
What are we gonna do?

405
00:31:00,562 --> 00:31:03,097
I think that we have
to wait this one out.

406
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,498
They'll come for us, right?

407
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:09,336
Maybe they'll wait
till the morning.

408
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:12,439
All we gotta do is we gotta
to stay afloat on this thing.

409
00:31:12,473 --> 00:31:14,642
But that's not until tomorrow.

410
00:31:14,676 --> 00:31:18,011
We can climb these rocks
and we'll send a signal,

411
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:19,614
the rescue crew has
gotta be around here.

412
00:31:19,647 --> 00:31:20,881
The storm's too strong.

413
00:31:22,316 --> 00:31:24,619
And I can't do that with my leg.

414
00:31:24,652 --> 00:31:26,053
No, I'll do it.

415
00:31:26,086 --> 00:31:26,954
No, I'll go.

416
00:31:26,987 --> 00:31:27,921
No!

417
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:29,490
You saw how...

418
00:31:29,524 --> 00:31:30,625
You saw me today on the reef.

419
00:31:30,658 --> 00:31:32,092
You saw how risky it was.

420
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:33,360
I don't even know
how far away we are.

421
00:31:33,394 --> 00:31:35,095
I mean, I can't even
see them anymore.

422
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:37,665
Listen, we have to stay put.

423
00:31:38,966 --> 00:31:40,467
We're grounded, okay?

424
00:31:40,502 --> 00:31:41,969
Okay.

425
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:43,538
They'll see us in the morning.

426
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:44,338
Okay.

427
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,641
What do I do about that?

428
00:31:46,674 --> 00:31:47,575
You gotta get me a towel.

429
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:48,442
Okay.

430
00:31:50,512 --> 00:31:52,446
Oh, okay, this?

431
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:53,581
Okay, okay, okay.

432
00:31:53,615 --> 00:31:54,481
Right on it.

433
00:31:54,516 --> 00:31:55,717
Yep.

434
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,985
- Is that good?
- Keep, keep pressure.

435
00:31:58,018 --> 00:31:59,587
- It got worse.
- Yeah.

436
00:31:59,621 --> 00:32:02,022
Yeah, when you were underwater,
I caught myself in that opening.

437
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:07,127
- Yeah.
- Here.

438
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:09,564
- Here, wrap that around it.
- Okay.

439
00:32:09,597 --> 00:32:10,998
Okay, tie it tight.

440
00:32:14,468 --> 00:32:16,003
Sorry.

441
00:32:16,036 --> 00:32:17,404
That hurt more
than I thought I did.

442
00:32:17,438 --> 00:32:19,039
Yeah.

443
00:32:19,072 --> 00:32:20,374
Okay, let's get
you comfortable.

444
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:27,615
I'm getting a
discount on this room.

445
00:33:07,555 --> 00:33:09,089
Oh my god.

446
00:33:09,122 --> 00:33:10,157
Honey!

447
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,158
Wake up!

448
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:12,259
Wake up!

449
00:33:12,292 --> 00:33:13,260
Honey, wake up!

450
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:16,531
Here, look, wake up.

451
00:33:36,316 --> 00:33:37,685
Fuck.

452
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:38,653
We could be anywhere.

453
00:33:38,686 --> 00:33:40,387
What are we gonna do?

454
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:43,658
I don't know.

455
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:45,192
No, we couldn't have
drifted that far.

456
00:33:52,332 --> 00:33:55,135
We should've
gotten on the rock!

457
00:33:55,168 --> 00:33:57,337
They were right there,
they could have seen us!

458
00:33:57,371 --> 00:33:59,641
The storm was too strong,
we could have been killed.

459
00:33:59,674 --> 00:34:01,275
I could have done it.

460
00:34:01,308 --> 00:34:03,845
They were there,
the rescue was right there!

461
00:34:03,878 --> 00:34:05,379
Honey, I understand.

462
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:06,614
I understand what you're saying.

463
00:34:06,648 --> 00:34:08,115
It was too dangerous.

464
00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:10,350
Maybe for you, but I
could have gone for us.

465
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:12,219
You were hanging off
the side of the house.

466
00:34:12,252 --> 00:34:13,453
Do you remember going
underneath the house?

467
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:14,722
And who put me down there!

468
00:34:14,756 --> 00:34:16,490
Jay, that's, that's ridiculous!

469
00:34:16,524 --> 00:34:18,760
I can't believe it,
we always do it your way,

470
00:34:18,793 --> 00:34:20,695
it's always your way!

471
00:34:20,728 --> 00:34:21,495
Stop!

472
00:34:21,529 --> 00:34:22,329
Stop it.

473
00:34:22,362 --> 00:34:23,731
I need to focus.

474
00:34:33,775 --> 00:34:37,144
Oh!

475
00:34:37,177 --> 00:34:39,379
Fuck.

476
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:41,348
Here, just help,
move me away from the water.

477
00:34:44,318 --> 00:34:46,521
I got it. I got it.

478
00:34:48,488 --> 00:34:49,156
Okay.

479
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:57,230
Just give me a
second to breathe.

480
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:08,208
Okay.

481
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:08,810
Okay.

482
00:35:11,178 --> 00:35:12,847
We need to keep
our heads about us.

483
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,315
We need to focus on surviving.

484
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:15,883
Okay?

485
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,153
Jay, honey.

486
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:23,791
We're still drifting.

487
00:35:26,259 --> 00:35:28,796
Yeah, probably,
slowly, yeah.

488
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,566
We could be getting
further away by the minute.

489
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,166
It's true, but we could
also be headed back to land.

490
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,670
I just wanna try to get back.

491
00:35:36,938 --> 00:35:38,573
Okay, okay.

492
00:35:38,606 --> 00:35:40,340
I agree with you.

493
00:35:40,374 --> 00:35:43,410
But I mean, where do we go,
which way do you want to swim?

494
00:35:43,443 --> 00:35:45,345
Which direction would we go?

495
00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:47,749
Let's just focus on surviving.

496
00:35:47,782 --> 00:35:49,784
We have to get
everything we can use.

497
00:35:49,817 --> 00:35:51,686
You just stay put.

498
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:52,520
I'll do it.

499
00:35:58,258 --> 00:36:00,728
Honey, just gather what we need.

500
00:36:00,762 --> 00:36:04,297
Look for water, blankets,
dry pillows, food.

501
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:06,934
I'll do it.

502
00:36:13,908 --> 00:36:14,809
Okay?

503
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:16,944
Just gather things up.

504
00:36:16,978 --> 00:36:18,478
Get anything you can.

505
00:37:02,757 --> 00:37:03,991
Water!

506
00:37:04,025 --> 00:37:04,892
More water!

507
00:37:37,825 --> 00:37:38,626
Come on.

508
00:38:53,868 --> 00:38:55,636
Ah.

509
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,336
Nice.

510
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,607
Yeah.

511
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:03,110
- Here.
- You go.

512
00:39:03,144 --> 00:39:05,012
It's okay, you have it.

513
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,688
We'll have to conserve.

514
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:18,893
Phone.

515
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:24,131
Can you come pick up our bags?

516
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:28,903
- Honey?
- Mm-hmm.

517
00:39:28,936 --> 00:39:30,171
What's wrong?

518
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:34,008
Swarm of fish scared
the shit out of me.

519
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:35,810
The shark bastards.

520
00:39:35,843 --> 00:39:37,444
Oh.

521
00:39:37,477 --> 00:39:38,478
You didn't happen to
catch one of them, did ya?

522
00:39:39,614 --> 00:39:41,682
I could use a little sushi.

523
00:39:41,716 --> 00:39:43,885
I was too scared
to think about sushi.

524
00:39:43,918 --> 00:39:46,053
You know what, if it's
not yellowtail, forget it.

525
00:39:55,963 --> 00:39:56,697
They'll come for us.

526
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,002
The raft is really big,
and it's very visible.

527
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:02,169
So, they'll see us.

528
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,908
We don't know where we are.

529
00:40:08,576 --> 00:40:09,877
What if another storm comes?

530
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,715
How long can we
last in all this?

531
00:40:14,749 --> 00:40:16,050
Alive now.

532
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:16,817
That's what matters.

533
00:40:19,053 --> 00:40:22,757
So much for the
fancy water villa, huh?

534
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:26,661
You had to go fancy
and impress the wife.

535
00:40:26,694 --> 00:40:28,663
I'm not impressed.

536
00:40:28,696 --> 00:40:31,666
It only matters if I live
to tell someone about it.

537
00:41:07,268 --> 00:41:08,769
Ow!

538
00:41:08,803 --> 00:41:11,138
- What is it?
- Shit.

539
00:41:11,172 --> 00:41:12,673
- Ah.
- What is it?

540
00:41:12,707 --> 00:41:14,241
I just, I just got burnt.

541
00:41:14,275 --> 00:41:16,010
- What?
- Yeah.

542
00:41:16,043 --> 00:41:16,944
Ah.

543
00:41:16,978 --> 00:41:17,778
You smell that?

544
00:41:20,247 --> 00:41:21,816
Smells like burnt hair.

545
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:23,117
Yeah.

546
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:23,918
Burnt the hair on the
inside of my thigh.

547
00:41:27,088 --> 00:41:29,290
What the hell!

548
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:32,126
Yeah, just scorched my balls.

549
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,594
Well, you gotta
keep it near you.

550
00:41:35,029 --> 00:41:36,030
Just want to keep
it off my nuts.

551
00:41:36,063 --> 00:41:37,231
Here.

552
00:41:37,264 --> 00:41:38,666
You want it on my thigh now?

553
00:41:57,184 --> 00:41:57,952
Wake up.

554
00:42:07,028 --> 00:42:08,796
Hey, over here!

555
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:09,964
Hey!

556
00:42:21,108 --> 00:42:22,877
Hey, over here!

557
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,311
Over here!

558
00:42:24,345 --> 00:42:26,047
Hey!

559
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,114
Over here!

560
00:42:27,148 --> 00:42:28,082
- They're too far away.
- Huh?

561
00:42:28,115 --> 00:42:29,583
Too far away.

562
00:42:31,085 --> 00:42:32,319
We have to try.

563
00:42:32,353 --> 00:42:34,321
If I can see them,
they can see us!

564
00:42:40,795 --> 00:42:42,296
- Smoke.
- What?

565
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:43,597
- Smoke.
- The bottle.

566
00:42:43,631 --> 00:42:44,865
- The bottle, yes.
- Yeah.

567
00:42:44,899 --> 00:42:46,133
Is that enough water?

568
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:48,169
Just drink it baby,
you need it.

569
00:42:48,202 --> 00:42:49,637
C'mon, drink it up.

570
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,905
I'm gonna fill it
up with salt water.

571
00:42:50,938 --> 00:42:51,705
Come on.

572
00:42:52,973 --> 00:42:53,908
Yes, okay.

573
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,351
Okay, here, do it, come on.

574
00:43:07,354 --> 00:43:10,024
I just need something.

575
00:43:10,057 --> 00:43:12,359
Find dry things, dry
things, anything dry.

576
00:43:13,828 --> 00:43:15,329
Here's paper.

577
00:43:15,362 --> 00:43:16,630
Okay.

578
00:43:16,664 --> 00:43:17,598
- No, it's too wet.
- Too wet.

579
00:43:23,904 --> 00:43:24,371
All right.

580
00:43:28,676 --> 00:43:29,076
What?

581
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,044
Do it!

582
00:43:31,178 --> 00:43:31,979
- No.
- Hurry.

583
00:43:34,815 --> 00:43:35,883
Fuck.

584
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:37,351
- Oh, fuck.
- What?

585
00:43:37,384 --> 00:43:38,285
The sun's too low.

586
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:39,753
- No!
- It's too low.

587
00:43:39,787 --> 00:43:40,888
- Try it again!
- The sun's too low.

588
00:43:40,921 --> 00:43:42,223
No!

589
00:43:42,256 --> 00:43:44,024
- Do it, honey, go, try again!
- It's too low.

590
00:43:44,058 --> 00:43:45,626
Oh, god.

591
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,163
Hey!

592
00:43:49,196 --> 00:43:50,331
Help!

593
00:43:50,364 --> 00:43:51,866
Help!

594
00:43:56,837 --> 00:43:58,405
Help!

595
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:02,409
Help!

596
00:44:03,177 --> 00:44:04,979
Help!

597
00:44:09,183 --> 00:44:10,718
Please.

598
00:44:10,751 --> 00:44:12,253
We're right here.

599
00:44:13,787 --> 00:44:16,323
They're gone, they're gone.

600
00:45:55,356 --> 00:45:57,124
Honey, honey.

601
00:45:57,157 --> 00:45:58,425
Honey.

602
00:46:03,063 --> 00:46:05,032
Come on, come here.

603
00:46:05,065 --> 00:46:06,267
Drink this.

604
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,068
Please drink this.

605
00:46:08,102 --> 00:46:10,538
There's not much,
but just drink it.

606
00:46:12,906 --> 00:46:13,541
Kyle.

607
00:46:28,188 --> 00:46:29,189
Oh my god.

608
00:46:29,223 --> 00:46:30,190
Oh my god.

609
00:46:30,224 --> 00:46:30,991
Oh my god.

610
00:46:33,394 --> 00:46:34,795
Over here!

611
00:46:35,597 --> 00:46:37,898
Over here!

612
00:46:39,466 --> 00:46:40,234
Over here.

613
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:46,574
Over here!

614
00:47:10,532 --> 00:47:12,132
Honey.

615
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:14,868
- Use the newspaper.
- Ok, yeah.

616
00:47:14,902 --> 00:47:16,470
Oh, baby.

617
00:47:16,504 --> 00:47:18,872
The newspaper, yes.

618
00:47:25,412 --> 00:47:26,980
- No, like-
- You got it?

619
00:47:27,014 --> 00:47:28,215
- I got it.
- Okay.

620
00:47:34,054 --> 00:47:37,592
Over here!

621
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:38,292
Over here!

622
00:47:38,325 --> 00:47:39,059
Over here!

623
00:48:06,588 --> 00:48:07,388
Over here!

624
00:48:07,421 --> 00:48:08,188
Over here!

625
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:10,057
Over here!

626
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:12,192
Over here!

627
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,294
Over here!

628
00:48:15,597 --> 00:48:16,964
- Over here.
- Hey.

629
00:48:16,997 --> 00:48:18,098
There's smoke.

630
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:28,075
It's working,
it's working, it's working.

631
00:48:28,108 --> 00:48:30,545
Get it.

632
00:48:34,616 --> 00:48:36,016
No!

633
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:37,317
No!

634
00:48:37,351 --> 00:48:38,653
They're going away!

635
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,388
Baby, more!

636
00:48:41,422 --> 00:48:42,624
More!

637
00:48:42,657 --> 00:48:44,258
More, more, everything.

638
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:46,226
Just put everything on them now!

639
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,162
We're going to lose them.

640
00:48:51,432 --> 00:48:53,300
They're gonna see us,
they're gonna see.

641
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:54,134
Help!

642
00:48:56,003 --> 00:48:56,738
Fuck.

643
00:48:56,771 --> 00:48:57,639
Hey, honey.

644
00:49:02,644 --> 00:49:03,711
No.

645
00:49:03,745 --> 00:49:04,411
Jay!

646
00:49:05,513 --> 00:49:06,480
Get outta here!

647
00:49:08,048 --> 00:49:09,049
Fuck!

648
00:49:15,389 --> 00:49:17,124
Come out, come out.

649
00:49:17,157 --> 00:49:17,725
Come out.

650
00:49:19,794 --> 00:49:21,361
Get outta there.

651
00:50:38,238 --> 00:50:39,306
What was that?

652
00:50:41,108 --> 00:50:42,376
What?

653
00:50:42,409 --> 00:50:44,344
I just saw something jump up.

654
00:50:57,324 --> 00:50:58,358
There it is again.

655
00:51:05,365 --> 00:51:07,401
I think maybe it's
just the current.

656
00:51:11,471 --> 00:51:13,373
No, it's a shark.

657
00:51:13,407 --> 00:51:14,474
It's a shark.

658
00:51:14,509 --> 00:51:16,076
Your leg, the blood!

659
00:51:21,549 --> 00:51:23,483
Let me, let me check, okay?

660
00:51:23,518 --> 00:51:24,384
The blood!

661
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:55,650
Shark, I see it, I see it.

662
00:51:55,683 --> 00:51:57,417
Okay, we have to
get out of the water.

663
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,824
Wait, over there there's
a board, can you make it?

664
00:52:02,857 --> 00:52:03,858
- Come on.
- Yeah.

665
00:52:03,891 --> 00:52:05,192
Come on.

666
00:52:05,225 --> 00:52:05,827
Come on!

667
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,227
Come on.

668
00:52:12,667 --> 00:52:13,768
Swim, baby.

669
00:52:13,801 --> 00:52:15,369
Hurry, hurry.

670
00:52:26,446 --> 00:52:27,247
I saw it!

671
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:30,918
Okay.

672
00:52:30,952 --> 00:52:31,819
Hurry.

673
00:52:31,853 --> 00:52:34,555
Come on.

674
00:52:34,589 --> 00:52:36,691
We have to get to that raft.

675
00:52:36,724 --> 00:52:38,458
Just stay still,
I'm gonna paddle.

676
00:52:39,927 --> 00:52:41,495
I gotta get my leg
out of the water.

677
00:52:42,964 --> 00:52:44,732
Oh, your leg.

678
00:52:44,766 --> 00:52:46,801
Gotta stay on.

679
00:52:49,436 --> 00:52:50,203
Sharks.

680
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:53,473
Oh my god.

681
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:57,244
We have to get to that raft!

682
00:52:57,277 --> 00:53:00,414
Stay still, baby,
I'm gonna paddle us over.

683
00:53:00,447 --> 00:53:01,281
Okay.

684
00:53:08,523 --> 00:53:09,691
Okay.

685
00:53:09,724 --> 00:53:11,391
Come here, come here.

686
00:53:19,499 --> 00:53:20,501
The other way.

687
00:53:21,703 --> 00:53:22,469
Come on.

688
00:53:47,595 --> 00:53:49,864
I fuckin' hate dolphins.

689
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:35,710
Ow, ow.

690
00:54:35,743 --> 00:54:37,845
It'll be here if you need it.

691
00:54:48,589 --> 00:54:49,724
This is it for us, isn't it?

692
00:54:51,491 --> 00:54:52,359
No one's coming.

693
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:57,999
You know, people
survive for months at sea.

694
00:54:59,834 --> 00:55:01,569
They only say that 'cause
they live to tell it.

695
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:06,073
Well, this is not our fate.

696
00:55:06,107 --> 00:55:06,874
So.

697
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:10,611
We're gonna make it.

698
00:55:13,147 --> 00:55:15,616
Just like, just like
all the other times.

699
00:55:16,918 --> 00:55:18,085
I'm sorry, I can't.

700
00:55:19,554 --> 00:55:20,955
You hate apologies, remember?

701
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:27,128
I dragged us into this hell.

702
00:55:27,161 --> 00:55:30,097
We would never have been here
if it wasn't for my dread.

703
00:55:30,131 --> 00:55:30,898
No.

704
00:55:36,137 --> 00:55:38,405
I could have done things better.

705
00:55:38,438 --> 00:55:42,442
I just, I could have been
more patient with your PTSD.

706
00:55:44,645 --> 00:55:47,648
And I shouldn't have left
you alone in your misery.

707
00:55:52,086 --> 00:55:53,688
I never should've
mentioned divorce.

708
00:55:56,591 --> 00:55:59,026
I just, I could've
done it better.

709
00:56:01,996 --> 00:56:04,832
I could've wanted,
but it doesn't matter.

710
00:56:04,866 --> 00:56:06,901
It doesn't matter.

711
00:56:06,934 --> 00:56:08,903
Because we brought
each other out here.

712
00:56:22,216 --> 00:56:23,684
Maybe this is our fate.

713
00:56:25,653 --> 00:56:28,556
Childless and die young.

714
00:56:28,589 --> 00:56:30,524
It's kinda cool,
it's like a rockstar fate.

715
00:56:32,627 --> 00:56:34,095
There's gonna be
concerts in your name.

716
00:56:36,697 --> 00:56:38,498
Fuckin' Flotel.

717
00:56:38,532 --> 00:56:39,901
We're like the unluckiest
couple in the world.

718
00:56:43,704 --> 00:56:44,505
Oh, honey.

719
00:56:46,774 --> 00:56:48,809
- Careful.
- We're not gonna...

720
00:56:55,116 --> 00:56:56,751
Listen to me.

721
00:56:56,784 --> 00:56:59,020
We're not gonna die.

722
00:56:59,053 --> 00:57:00,655
We're not gonna die.

723
00:57:10,031 --> 00:57:12,633
Do you remember Carl's wedding?

724
00:57:12,667 --> 00:57:14,602
And I saw you a week
later at that dog park.

725
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:17,071
You had that, that Pitbull.

726
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:19,907
He was so cute.

727
00:57:21,108 --> 00:57:23,210
You had that
ridiculous picture.

728
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:25,746
Oh.

729
00:57:27,148 --> 00:57:28,883
We're gonna be okay.

730
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:29,884
Okay?

731
00:57:29,917 --> 00:57:31,252
I don't want you to worry.

732
00:57:31,285 --> 00:57:32,653
We're gonna be fine.

733
00:57:32,687 --> 00:57:33,754
We're gonna make it.

734
00:57:35,623 --> 00:57:37,191
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

735
00:57:37,224 --> 00:57:39,727
- Yeah?
- You know that?

736
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,730
You're like my best friend.

737
00:57:43,264 --> 00:57:44,031
My wife.

738
00:57:47,001 --> 00:57:48,135
You're more than I'll ever have.

739
00:57:55,543 --> 00:57:56,911
We're gonna be okay.

740
00:57:58,245 --> 00:58:00,147
We're gonna be okay, baby.

741
00:58:01,615 --> 00:58:02,249
You promise?

742
00:58:05,786 --> 00:58:07,788
I promise.

743
00:58:21,268 --> 00:58:22,737
I promise.

744
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,681
Baby?

745
00:59:07,715 --> 00:59:09,884
Honey, are you okay?

746
00:59:26,233 --> 00:59:29,170
Oh, fuck you!

747
01:00:14,381 --> 01:00:15,182
Kyle!

748
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,121
Kyle.

749
01:00:20,154 --> 01:00:20,921
Kyle!

750
01:00:30,131 --> 01:00:31,365
You have to get
out of the water!

751
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:34,935
You have to get
out of the water!

752
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:38,172
It's okay, I can't move, okay?

753
01:00:38,205 --> 01:00:39,673
Just go!

754
01:00:39,707 --> 01:00:41,675
Go, paddle, go, get your paddle!

755
01:00:41,709 --> 01:00:43,844
Hurry, hurry, oh god!

756
01:00:43,878 --> 01:00:44,345
Oh god!

757
01:02:18,205 --> 01:02:19,039
Honey, honey.

758
01:02:20,341 --> 01:02:21,475
Honey, wake up!

759
01:02:21,509 --> 01:02:22,510
There's land.

760
01:02:22,544 --> 01:02:24,044
There's land, baby!

761
01:02:32,152 --> 01:02:33,387
No, baby!

762
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,221
No.

763
01:02:34,255 --> 01:02:35,089
No.

764
01:02:35,122 --> 01:02:36,357
Come on.

765
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:37,358
Wake up.

766
01:02:37,391 --> 01:02:39,126
Come on, baby, wake up!

767
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:41,028
Wake up, c'mon!

768
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:43,330
Wake up!

769
01:02:47,067 --> 01:02:48,235
I'm gonna wake you up.

770
01:02:48,269 --> 01:02:49,970
You're gonna wake up now, okay?

771
01:02:50,004 --> 01:02:51,939
You're gonna wake up now!

772
01:02:51,972 --> 01:02:53,173
You're gonna wake up!

773
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,120
Wake up!

774
01:03:06,153 --> 01:03:07,087
Wake up!

775
01:03:07,121 --> 01:03:08,122
Wake up now!

776
01:03:10,991 --> 01:03:12,493
You have to wake up.

777
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:18,432
Wake up, come on.

778
01:03:22,269 --> 01:03:23,505
I need you.

779
01:03:23,538 --> 01:03:25,072
Don't leave me!

780
01:04:02,209 --> 01:04:03,844
I love you.

781
01:04:06,447 --> 01:04:08,482
My best friend.

782
01:04:45,486 --> 01:04:46,588
Kyle.

783
01:05:02,302 --> 01:05:03,671
Kyle.

784
01:05:13,548 --> 01:05:14,214
Live.

785
01:05:16,651 --> 01:05:17,418
How?

786
01:05:19,286 --> 01:05:24,057
Do you remember the feeling
of the baby inside you?

787
01:05:27,094 --> 01:05:28,462
I do.

788
01:05:29,463 --> 01:05:30,964
Yeah.

789
01:05:30,998 --> 01:05:32,600
The same life is inside you now.

790
01:05:34,602 --> 01:05:37,104
I need you.

791
01:05:37,137 --> 01:05:38,673
I'm right here.

792
01:05:38,706 --> 01:05:40,040
You're with me?

793
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:37,585
Wake up, please!

794
01:13:37,618 --> 01:13:38,219
Please!

795
01:13:38,252 --> 01:13:39,520
Please wake up!

796
01:13:41,756 --> 01:13:42,556
Help me.

797
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:43,724
Please help me.

798
01:13:43,758 --> 01:13:45,226
Help me, please.

799
01:13:45,259 --> 01:13:46,894
Look, my leg.

800
01:13:46,928 --> 01:13:47,995
My leg!

801
01:13:48,362 --> 01:13:49,664
Look, a shark.

802
01:13:49,697 --> 01:13:51,032
A shark bit me.

803
01:13:51,065 --> 01:13:52,066
It's so bad.

804
01:13:54,535 --> 01:13:55,970
Shark and...

805
01:13:56,003 --> 01:13:57,939
Water, yeah.

806
01:13:57,972 --> 01:14:02,243
I was out there in the
ocean, my husband died.

807
01:14:02,276 --> 01:14:04,845
Please, can you take me home?

808
01:14:04,879 --> 01:14:06,714
Can you take me home?

809
01:14:09,216 --> 01:14:10,584
Thank you.

810
01:14:11,252 --> 01:14:12,720
Thank you.

811
01:14:16,724 --> 01:14:17,658
Yeah, it's bad.

812
01:14:17,692 --> 01:14:19,193
Oh, you wanna look at it?

813
01:14:19,226 --> 01:14:20,027
Oh.

814
01:14:20,061 --> 01:14:20,861
Ow.

815
01:14:20,895 --> 01:14:22,630
Okay, okay.

816
01:14:32,773 --> 01:14:33,541
Oh.

817
01:14:34,642 --> 01:14:36,077
Oh.

818
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:36,844
Oh.

819
01:14:42,116 --> 01:14:43,718
Oh.

820
01:14:43,751 --> 01:14:44,552
Oh.

821
01:14:44,585 --> 01:14:45,519
Oh.

822
01:14:45,553 --> 01:14:46,153
Yeah.

823
01:14:46,187 --> 01:14:46,954
Okay.

824
01:14:48,622 --> 01:14:49,757
Okay, okay.

825
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:50,758
Okay?

826
01:14:54,228 --> 01:14:54,895
Oh.

827
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:04,705
- Okay.
- Okay.

828
01:15:04,739 --> 01:15:06,707
Yeah, do it.

829
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:12,947
Okay.

830
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:30,898
Okay, okay.

831
01:16:07,301 --> 01:16:08,169
Okay, okay.

832
01:17:11,065 --> 01:17:12,032
Sir?

833
01:17:12,066 --> 01:17:13,267
Sir, where are you?

834
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:14,869
Sir?

835
01:17:14,902 --> 01:17:15,669
Sir?

836
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:18,072
Sir?

837
01:17:18,105 --> 01:17:19,874
There, there's sharks!

838
01:17:19,907 --> 01:17:21,375
The sharks are near!

839
01:17:21,408 --> 01:17:22,877
Sharks!

840
01:17:23,744 --> 01:17:25,179
Sir, get out!

841
01:17:29,416 --> 01:17:30,184
Sir!

842
01:17:31,418 --> 01:17:32,286
Sir!

843
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:40,127
Sir!

844
01:17:42,296 --> 01:17:43,697
Sir!

845
01:18:46,227 --> 01:18:47,361
Give me your arm!

846
01:18:50,264 --> 01:18:52,534
Come on, use your
feet, use your feet.

847
01:20:50,918 --> 01:20:52,286
That's right, mother fucker.

848
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:53,120
Not today.

849
01:21:22,517 --> 01:21:23,317
That's okay.

850
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:24,918
You want more?

851
01:21:24,952 --> 01:21:26,220
Do you want more?

852
01:21:26,253 --> 01:21:27,254
Fuck you.

853
01:21:27,287 --> 01:21:29,691
I'll give you more.

854
01:21:30,725 --> 01:21:31,892
