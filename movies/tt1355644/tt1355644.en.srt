<i>Good morning, James.</i>

<i>How are you feeling?</i>

4
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,127
Wait. What?

5
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,285
<i>It's perfectly normal to feel confused.</i>

6
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,921
<i>You just spent 120 years

7

What?

8
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,325
<i>It's okay, James.</i>

9
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,882
- It's Jim.
<i>- Jim.</i>

10

<i>Room to grow.</i>

18
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,324

<i>Whatever you do, don't get homesick,

47
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,816
<i>Let's start things off

48
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,161
<i>Once upon a time

No.

<i>Your introduction to colonial life.</i>

58
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,441
<i>Earth is a prosperous planet,
the cradle of civilization.</i>

59
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,681
<i>But for many, it's also overpopulated,
overpriced, overrated.</i>

60
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,442
I'm sorry, I think I may be in the wrong...

<i>The colonies offer an alternative,
a better way of life.</i>

64

Where are all the other...

65
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,770
<i>And there's no colony
more beautiful than Homestead II,</i>

69

<i>We are all on the</i> Starship Avalon.

73
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,763
<i>We're all in this together.</i>

74
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,921
<i>Hello?</i>

75
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,211
Anybody here?

76
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,051
Hello?

77
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,050
<i>Please buckle up
and secure any loose items.</i>

78

<i>This elevator will experience

79
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,769
<i>Grand concourse.</i>

80
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,841
<i>Hello.</i>

81

<i>Can I help you?</i>

83
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,083
I need to talk to a person.

84
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,810
A real live person, please?

85
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,087
<i>What sort of person?
Personal trainer? Travel planner?</i>

86
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,770
<i>- Therapist?</i>
- I... I don't know.

87
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,245
Somebody in charge.

88
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,129
<i>The ship's steward
handles passenger affairs.</i>

89
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,328
<i>It's on level three of the grand concourse.</i>

90
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,084
- Thank you.
<i>- Happy to help.</i>

91
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,801
Not good.

92
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,816
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Who's flying the ship?

93
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,816
<i>The flight crew, the captain, the pilot,
the chief navigator...</i>

94
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,922
Captain. I want to speak to the captain.

95
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,843
<i>The captain rarely handles
passenger queries...</i>

96
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,684
It's an emergency! Please.

97
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,448
<i>The captain is usually found on
the bridge, in the command ring.</i>

98

<i>Bridge access requires
special authorization.</i>

99
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,690
<i>Bridge access requires
special authorization.</i>

100
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,961
You got to be kidding me.

101
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,602
<i>Welcome to the observatory.</i>

102
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,040
<i>What can I show you?</i>

103
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,248
We're supposed to land soon.

104
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,890
I'm... I'm the only one awake.

105
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,560
<i>I don't understand. What can I show you?</i>

106
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,651
Show me Homestead II.

107
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,769
<i>Homestead II is the fourth planet
in the Bhakti System.</i>

108
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,327
Right. And where are we?

109
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,404
<i>We're in transit from
Earth to Homestead II.</i>

110

<i>We will arrive in approximately 90 years.</i>

111
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
What?

112
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,842
<i>We arrive at Homestead II
in 90 years, three weeks and one day.</i>

113
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,081
No. Wait.

114
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,764
How long ago did we leave Earth?

115
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,320
<i>Approximately 30 years ago.</i>

116
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,641
I woke up too soon.

117
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,009
<i>Hello.</i>

118
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,690
How do I send a message to Earth?

<i>Interstellar messages are

<i>This is an expensive service.</i>

121
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,444
- Bite me.
<i>- Happy to help.</i>

122
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,640
<i>Planet and connection?</i>

123
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,803
Earth. The Homestead Company.

124

<i>There are 30,826 contacts
listed under Homestead Company.</i>

125

I'm emigrating to Homestead II

126

<i>I have a customer help line.</i>

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,681
<i>Begin message.</i>

129
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,731
Hi. Uh, I'm Jim Preston.

130
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,045
I'm a passenger on the <i>Avalon.</i>

131
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,205
I, uh...

132
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,124
I think something went wrong
with my hibernation pod.

133
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,565
<i>I woke up too soon.</i>

134
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,326
<i>And I mean, way too soon.</i>

135
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,051
<i>Nobody else is awake, and...</i>

136
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,364
<i>I don't know how to get back to sleep.</i>

137
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,569
And the thing is, there's 90 years to go.

138
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,411
At this rate, I'm...

139
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,366
I'm sorry, I'm trying to fix this.

140
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,484
Maybe I missed something.
I could use a hand.

141
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,525
That's all.

142
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,367
Thank you.

143
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,291
<i>Message sent.</i>

<i>Earliest reply in 55 years.</i>

148
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,848
Fifty-five years?

149
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,202
<i>We apologize for the delay.</i>

150
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,806

<i>Call me irresponsible</i>

152
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,644
- Afternoon.
- Oh, man!

153
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,803
Is it good to see another face!

154
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,730
Thought I was the only one awake.

155
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,923
Who wants to sleep
on a beautiful day like this?

156
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,924
No, I mean we're in trouble.
We're not supposed to be here.

157
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,049
Well, I won't tell if you don't.

158
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,768
- Huh?
- Our little secret.

159
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,686
What can I get for you?

160
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,881
What?

161
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,445
You look like a whiskey man.

162
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,520
Uh, okay.

163
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,845
Oh, you're a robot.

164
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,767
Android. Technically.

165
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,361
Arthur's the name.

166
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,841
- Jim.
- Pleased to meet you, Jim.

167
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,604
How much do you know about this ship?

168
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,571
I don't know.

169
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,721
I know some things.

170
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,241
What do I do
if my hibernation pod malfunctions?

171
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,800
Oh, hibernation pods are fail-safe.

172
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,211
They never malfunction.

173
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,486
Well, I woke up early.

174
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,001
Can't happen.

175
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,523
How long until we get to Homestead II?

176
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,443
About 90 years or so.

177
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,536
And when are all the passengers
supposed to wake up?

178
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,403
Not till the last four months.

179
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,562
How is it that I'm sitting here with you

180
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,849
with 90 years to go?

181
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,804
Hmm?

182
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,805
It's not possible for you to be here.

183
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,205
Well, I am.

184
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,571
<i>Good morning.
It's a beautiful day here on the</i> Avalon.

185
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,929
<i>So wake up, sunshine.
It's time to relax and enjoy your stay.</i>

186
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,889
<i>Please make a selection.</i>

187
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,850
<i>Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme
is reserved for gold-class passengers.</i>

188
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,491
<i>Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme
is reserved for...</i>

189
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,000
I want the Mocha Cappuccino Extreme.

190
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,087
Bill my room, please.

191
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,730
<i>Food can be purchased in the ship's...</i>

192
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,290
<i>Sorry. The French Roast...</i>

193
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,725
<i>Sorry. The Pumpkin Spice...</i>

194
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,401
<i>Sorry. Vanilla Chai...</i>

195
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,760
<i>Sorry. Sorry.</i>

196
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,888
<i>Sorry.</i>

197
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,961
<i>Large coffee.</i>

198
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,008
- Cream...
<i>- Please enjoy your coffee.</i>

199
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,521
Oh, really?

200
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,526
<i>Crew pod room access
requires special authorization.</i>

201
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,606
<i>Grand...</i>

202
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,681
<i>Going...</i>

203
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,565
<i>Please make... Level...</i>

204
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,204
<i>Grand concourse.</i>

205
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,406
<i>I'm screwed, Arthur.</i>

206
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,083
Completely and ridiculously screwed.

207
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,491
Come on, now.

208
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,608
Every cloud has a silver lining.

209
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,650
Guess I am gonna die of
old age on this ship.

210
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,205
Oh, we all die.

211
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,320
Even androids end up on the scrap heap.

212
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,321
I'm your only customer.
Why are you always polishing a glass?

213
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,930
Trick of the trade.

214
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,651
Makes people nervous
when a bartender just stands there.

215
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,290
So lay some bartender wisdom on me.

216
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,164
I'm lost in space here.

217
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,966
You're not where you want to be.

218
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,566
You feel like you're supposed
to be somewhere else.

219
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,081
You said it.

220
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,929
Well, say you could snap your fingers

221
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,441
and be wherever you wanted to be.

222
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,284
I bet you'd still feel this way.

223
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,085
Not in the right place.

224
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,960
Point is, you can't get so hung up
on where you'd rather be

225
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,281
that you forget how to make
the most of where you are.

226
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,405
What are you telling me?

227
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,529
Take a break from worrying
about what you can't control.

228
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,367
Live a little.

229
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,169
Live a little.

230
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,811
<i>Welcome to the Vienna Suite.</i>

231
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,881
Oh.

232
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,570
Oh, yeah.

233
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,564
Huh.

234
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,845
What?

235
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,971
Ah!

236
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,402
<i>- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!</i>
- Yeah!

237
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,005
Make that a double jumbo shrimp.

238
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,401
Triple.

239
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,761
Dance-off.

240
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,525
All right.

241
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,840
I did exactly what you just did.

242
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,803
<i>Large coffee.</i>

243
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,930
<i>You have had many, señor.</i>

244
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,681
<i>Sí, señor.</i>

245
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,281
<i>Gracias.</i>

246
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,646
<i>Come on, come on</i>

247
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,291
<i>Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!</i>

248
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,651
<i>A little less conversation
A little more action, please</i>

249
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,489
Get out of here!

250
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,360
Come back. Hey.

251
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,127
Come here.

252
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,410
<i>Welcome, Jim.</i>

253
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,171
<i>Please turn your attention</i>

254
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,483
<i>to the screens displaying safety tips.</i>

255
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,849
<i>These spacesuits are designed to withstand
the harsh environment of space.</i>

256
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,127
<i>The carbon fiber and polyamide construction</i>

257
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,568
<i>means your suit is both
flexible and durable.</i>

258
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,731
<i>Remember,
your spacesuit is your lifeline.</i>

259
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,720
<i>Slide the handle on the right
to release the air pressure.</i>

260
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,367
<i>Your magnetic boots are now engaged.</i>

261
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,800
<i>They can be deactivated
using the control panel on your arm.</i>

262
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,326
<i>Press the red button
to open the airlock door.</i>

263
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,084
<i>Have a wonderful time.</i>

264
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,647
<i>Tether attached.</i>

265
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,685
<i>Welcome back, Jim.</i>

266
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,482
<i>We hope you decide to join us again soon</i>

267
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,927
<i>for another thrilling experience.</i>

268
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,843
<i>Have a wonderful time.</i>

269
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,050
Aurora.

270
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,842
<i>Searching passenger profiles.</i>

271
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,884
<i>I'm Aurora Lane.</i>

272
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,930
<i>Passenger 1456. I'm a writer.</i>

273
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,730
<i>I think we tell each other stories</i>

274
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,485
<i>to know we're not alone, to make contact.</i>

275
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,088
<i>Your father was Oliver Lane,
a Pulitzer Prize-winning author.</i>

276
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,446
<i>No pressure, right?</i>

277
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,922
<i>My dad used to say,
"If you live an ordinary life,</i>

278
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,287
<i>"all you'll have are ordinary stories.</i>

279
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,522
<i>"You have to live a life of adventure."</i>

280
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,564
<i>So...</i>

281
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,721
<i>Here I am.</i>

282
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,330
Good morning.

283
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,810
<i>We're starting over in every way.</i>

284
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,051
<i>I'll have to figure out
where to live, how to live,</i>

285
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,645
<i>Who my friends will be.</i>

286
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,056
<i>It's like the first day of school.</i>

287
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,320
<i>If the school bus took 120
years to get there.</i>

288
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,283
<i>We're creating a culture...</i>

289
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,487
You are funny.

290
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,291
Do you ever read something
and feel like it's written just for you?

291
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,883
I don't do a lot of reading.

292
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,724
She's good.

293
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,971
Who's that?

294
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,168
- Aurora.
- Ah...

295
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,086
The sleeping girl.

296
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,208
You know, I'm not saying
the universe is evil,

297
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,089
but it sure has a nasty sense of humor.

298
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,161
How is that?

299
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,766
You get to fly to another planet,

300
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,320
but you'll die along the way.

301
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,880
And you find the perfect woman

302
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,969
right in front of you...

303
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,924
Yet she's completely out of reach.

304
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,244
<i>Yeah, I'll miss New York City.</i>

305
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,936
<i>Give me a cup of coffee
and a view of the Chrysler Building,</i>

306
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,200
<i>and I can write all day.</i>

307
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,776
<i>They do have coffee on Homestead II, right?</i>

308
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,847
<i>They better have coffee.</i>

309
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,287
<i>If they don't, I have to turn around
and come back to Earth.</i>

310
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,528
<i>Is there anything
you regret leaving behind?</i>

311
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,283
<i>Yeah, I'll miss the trees
in Central Park turning in the fall.</i>

312
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,125
<i>I'll also miss crowds...</i>

313
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,604
Say you were trapped on a desert island,

314
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,931
and you had the power
to wish somebody there with you.

315
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,809
You wouldn't be alone anymore.

316
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,922
But you'd be stranding the person
on the island.

317
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,441
How do... Would you make that wish?

318
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,887
I don't know. I've never been on an island.

319
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,610
Okay, well, yeah.

320
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,610
Uh... Forget the island.

321
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,125
Let's say you figured out
how to do something

322
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,496
that would make your life
a million times better,

323
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,126
but you knew it was wrong
and there's no taking it back.

324
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,281
How do you do the math?

325
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,728
Jim, these are not robot questions.

326
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,725
I know how to wake Aurora up.

327
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,531
Oh. Well, that seems like a fine idea.

328
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,681
You could use some company.

329
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,486
I'd be stranding her on this ship
for the rest of her life.

330
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,767
Oh. Well, you can't do that.

331
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,526
What am I gonna do?

332
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,085
I'm here for you.

333
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,969
Arthur, you're a machine.

334
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,324
See? You can't feel that.
You don't have feelings.

335
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,361
See?

336
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,124
That doesn't hurt.

337
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,202
And you don't even mind.

338
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,325
'Cause you're not a person.

339
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,441
Don't even think about it.

340
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,931
No more Aurora talk.

341
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,445
I'm over it.

342
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,961
I'm moving on.

343
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,129
Don't even think about it!

344
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,136
What am I gonna do?
I'm just gonna sit and think about it?

345
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,696
I'm not... I can't think about it,
so I'm not going to.

346
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,563
That's the deal. I've made my decision.

347
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,641
I know what I'm doing.

348
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,520
I just cut it off.

349
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,096
I'm not... No more.

350
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,736
You won't hear me bring up her name again.

351
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,320
I'll never even mention her name again.

352
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,481
Done.

353
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,204
You can't do it.

354
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,805
Shaving off my beard.

355
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,563
Please don't do it.

356
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,445
<i>Good morning, Aurora.</i>

357
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,682
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

358
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,570
<i>It's perfectly normal to feel confused.</i>

359
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,763
<i>You just spent 120 years
in suspended animation.</i>

360
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,208
<i>Grand concourse.</i>

361
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,725
Hello?

362
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,480
Anybody?

363
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,361
Hello.

364
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,241
Hi.

365
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,409
Are you passenger or crew?

366
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,284
Passenger.

367
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,521
Jim Preston.

368
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,250
Aurora Lane.

369
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,449
Do you know what's going on?

370
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,443
Nobody else from my row woke up.

371
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,841
Same for me.

372
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,645
The crew's supposed to wake up
a month before we do,

373
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,484
but I haven't seen anybody.

374
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,890
The crew is still asleep.

375
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,689
Are you saying nobody's awake?

376
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,447
Just me.

377
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,961
Just you?

378
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,406
It's just us.

379
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,767
But somebody's got to land the ship
in a few weeks.

380
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,888
<i>We will arrive in approximately 89 years.</i>

381
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,122
Eighty-nine years?

382
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,284
The other passengers aren't late waking up.

383
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,444
We were early.

384
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,327
We... We need help.

385
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,640
Where's the crew?

386
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,965
The crew's in a secure
hibernation room.

387
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,328
Everything important, the controls,
the reactors, the engines...

388
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,004
It's all behind firewalls.

389
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,764
There's no way through.

390
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,487
How long have you been awake?

391
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,889
A year and three weeks.

392
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,371
No. No, no, no.

393
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,645
No, this can't be happening.

394
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,209
We have to go back to sleep.

395
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,211
Aurora, we can't.

396
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,368
We just have to get back to our pods
and start them up again.

397
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,291
I can't find my pod.
I can't find my pod.

398
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,601
I can't find my pod. I don't know which...

399
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,170
It doesn't matter.

400
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,810
- Aurora...
- I can't find it!

401
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,696
- Stop. Aurora...
- I can't find which one is mine!

402
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,370
- Stop.
- I don't know which one is mine!

403
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,560
- I'll help you.
- I can't...

404
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,126
Stop! It doesn't matter.

405
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,082
Putting somebody into hibernation
requires special equipment.

406
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,643
Remember the facility
where they put us under,

407
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,087
all the procedures we went through?

408
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,447
These pods are designed
to keep us in hibernation,

409
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,045
to wake us up at the right time,

410
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,764
but they can't put us back to sleep.

411
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,725
You don't think there's a way
back into hibernation?

412
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,605
No.

413
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,250
But there has to be.

414
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,525
There has to be.

415
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,165
9:00. Nighttime.

416
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,084
I know I should be
working the problem, but...

417
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,524
I can't even keep my eyes open.

418
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,483
You just came out of hibernation.

419
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,006
It's going to be a couple of days
before you're 100%.

420
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,525
You should get some rest.

421
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,324
Think I'm gonna have to.

422
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,011
I'll walk you to your cabin.

423
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,606
No, it's okay. I'll be all right.

424
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,481
Okay.

425
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,407
Good night, Aurora.

426
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,243
More than a year?

427
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,129
I can't imagine.

428
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,365
It must have been so hard for you.

429
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,925
It was.

430
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,445
Good night, Jim.

431
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,329
<i>Please buckle up and secure
any loose items.</i>

432
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,961
- Whiskey, neat.
- Sure thing.

433
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,126
How's your day been?

434
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,121
Aurora's awake.

435
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,004
Congratulations.

436
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,765
You don't look happy.

437
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,610
Arthur, can you keep a secret?

438
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,210
Jim...

439
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,851
I'm not just a bartender, I'm a gentleman.

440
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,801
Don't tell Aurora that I woke her up.

441
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,600
She thinks it was an accident.
Let me tell her.

442
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,251
Of course.

443
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,176
How can there be no way
to put someone back into hibernation?

444
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,611
What if a pod breaks down?

445
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,444
<i>No hibernation pod has malfunctioned</i>

446
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,807
<i>in thousands of interstellar flights.</i>

447
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,051
Well, I'm awake.

448
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,407
<i>Hibernation pods are fail-safe.</i>

449
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,280
Good morning.

450
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,284
- Have you eaten?
- No. I'm starving.

451
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,681
And this is the dumbest machine.

452
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,325
<i>Happy to help.</i>

453
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,046
<i>Gold-class breakfast.</i>

454
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,204
Well, you're a man of simple tastes.

455
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,962
I'm not a gold-class passenger.

456
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,408
French breakfast puffs above my pay grade.

457
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,970
What? This whole time?

458
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,804
- Yeah.
- What can I get you?

459
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,848
- No. No, I'm fine.
- Stop it.

460
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,729
Really. Okay.

461
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,771
Here you go.

462
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,681
Yeah.

463
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,483
So, I was thinking,
maybe there's another way to go to sleep.

464
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,766
What about the infirmary?

465
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,241
I checked it out.
It's just scanners and an Autodoc.

466
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,766
There could be another hibernation machine
in the cargo hold.

467
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,966
I had that thought, too.

468
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,376
And then I read the manifest.

469
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,448
It's mostly farming stuff,
machines and trade goods.

470
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,167
Replacement parts
for computers and engineering.

471
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,607
We're not gonna find
a hibernation facility in a box.

472
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,409
- We could build our own.
- We can't.

473
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,600
Jim, you're not even trying.

474
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,961
I have tried everything.

475
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,044
For over a year, I...

476
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,406
I tried everything.

477
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,925
Well...

478
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,085
Well, I'm not ready to give up.

479
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,244
<i>Infirmary.</i>

480
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,805
What about research articles?
Any kind of technical documents.

481
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,486
<i>Hibernation technology is proprietary.</i>

482
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,281
<i>The following articles deal with the
subject on a theoretical level.</i>

483
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,887
New file. My voyage.

484
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,726
I boarded the <i>Avalon</i> with an idea,
a destination.

485
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,888
Both now out of reach.

486
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,890
<i>I've been awake for seven days.</i>

487
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,968
<i>Awake far too soon.</i>

488
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,567
And I may well spend the
rest of my life here,

489
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:15,160
<i>in a steel world 1,000 meters long.</i>

490
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,929
<i>There's another passenger awake,
a mechanic named Jim Preston.</i>

491
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,731
He seems to have accepted our fate.

492
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,403
<i>But I'm scared.</i>

493
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,010
<i>I'm fighting to stay calm.</i>

494
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,241
<i>All the other passengers will sleep</i>

495
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,322
<i>for another 90 years</i>

496
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,166
<i>while I live out my life on this ship,</i>

497
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,649
<i>traveling forever...</i>

498
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,483
<i>Never arriving...</i>

499
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,807
<i>My only companion a total stranger.</i>

500
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,121
Why did you do it?

501
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,841
Do what?

502
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,960
Emigrate. Leave Earth.

503
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,576
I'm interviewing you.

504
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,601
You're what?

505
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,287
You were the first hibernation failure
in the history of space travel.

506
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,441
That makes you a story.

507
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,851
Who you gonna tell?

508
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,081
Posterity.

509
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,970
So, why did you give up your life on Earth?

510
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:28,366
120-year space hibernation means
you'll never see your family or friends again.

511
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,771
You'll wake up in a new century
on a new planet.

512
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,569
It's the ultimate geographical suicide.

513
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,407
Well, I could ask you the same thing.

514
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,323
But it's my interview.

515
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,603
Were you running away from something?

516
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,330
No.

517
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,721
- Everything was okay.
- So?

518
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,296
Well, I guess I just wanted a new world,

519
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,481
I don't know, a fresh start.

520
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,563
That's Homestead Company advertising.

521
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,051
- Is it?
- Jim.

522
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,009
I... I know. I guess. You're right.

523
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,330
Back on Earth, when something breaks,
you don't fix it, you replace it.

524
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,931
The colonies, they have problems to solve.

525
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,844
They're my kind of problems.

526
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,642
And a mechanic is somebody.

527
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,927
This is a new world still being built.

528
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,321
I could build a house and live in it.

529
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,851
Open country. Room to grow.

530
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,400
Now you're back to slogans.

531
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,245
Can't slogans be true?

532
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,536
<i>Do you know how much
Homestead Company</i>

533
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,642
made off its first planet?

534
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,802
Eight quadrillion dollars.

535
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,611
That's eight million billions.

536
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,087
Colony planets
are the biggest business going.

537
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,204
Did you pay full price for your ticket?

538
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,647
No. I'm in a desirable trade.

539
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,282
So they fill your head with dreams,
discount your ticket,

540
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,249
and you fly off to populate their planet

541
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,448
and give Homestead
20% of everything that you make

542
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,560
for the rest of your life.

543
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,729
Not to mention the debt you run up
on this fancy starship.

544
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,882
So all you see here is 5,000 suckers?

545
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,402
I see zeros
on the Homestead Company's bottom line.

546
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,770
I see 5,000 men and women
changing their lives.

547
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,365
For 5,000 different reasons.
You don't know these people.

548
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,131
I'm a journalist. I know people.

549
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,801
Really?

550
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,561
This one.

551
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,520
Is he a banker, a teacher or a gardener?

552
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,924
- Banker.
- He's a gardener.

553
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,126
And her. Is she a...

554
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,971
Madison, Donna or a Lola?

555
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,362
Donna's too serious for that hair.

556
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,441
Lola.

557
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,328
- Madison.
- Shit!

558
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,524
All right, chef, accountant or midwife?

559
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,807
She has to be a midwife.

560
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,496
There's no way you just made that one up.

561
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,567
Yeah. She's a midwife.

562
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,442
I didn't know they still had midwives.

563
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,086
I like her. We'd be friends.

564
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,404
You think you can see that?

565
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,891
Don't you?

566
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,241
I do.

567
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,886
- A round-trip ticket?
- That's right.

568
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,361
I was gonna fly to Homestead II,
live for a year,

569
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,771
and then right back to Earth.

570
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,488
I don't get it. I left Earth for a new life,
but you end up back where you started?

571
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,210
I end up in the future.

572
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,487
Two hundred and fifty years in the future,

573
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,325
on Earth, which is still
the center of civilization,

574
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,640
like it or not.

575
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,962
And I'll be the only writer to ever travel
to a colony world and come back.

576
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,969
I'll have a story no one else can tell.

577
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,570
What story?

578
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,961
Humanity's flight to the stars.

579
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,008
The greatest migration in human history.

580
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,730
It's the biggest story there is.

581
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,056
But you won't know
any of the people who are reading it.

582
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,570
But they'd be reading it.

583
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,325
Or they would have been.

584
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,326
I'll never write it now.

585
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,490
I don't know if I'll ever write again.

586
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,970
Jim, I can't think of anything else to try

587
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,450
to save us.

588
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,841
And I don't even want to
think about it anymore.

589
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,685
What is there to do around here?

590
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,927
- Are you serious?
- Dead serious.

591
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,964
- Partner mode.
<i>- Let's get it on!</i>

592
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,486
Come on, get in power mode.

593
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,730
You just stand here.

594
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,211
And then we repeat what they do.

595
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,527
Uh, is there anything else we can do?

596
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,806
- Just do the...
- Okay.

597
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,256
- You don't have to.
- Okay. I can...

598
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,123
<i>- Beat down!</i>
- Hey!

599
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,445
Here we go. Let's see it. Oh!

600
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,450
Whoa! Whoa! Oh.

601
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,896
Oh!

602
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,843
- Why you smiling?
<i>- Aurora! Aurora!</i>

603
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,570
'Cause I'm up two points.

604
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,320
Who's the lovely lady?

605
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,646
This is Aurora.

606
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,121
Aurora. A pleasure.

607
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,364
- I can't!
- You did great!

608
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,640
Okay, one more time.
One more time, let's see it.

609
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,885
Oh!

610
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,721
- Yes!
- Whoo!

611
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,920
I swear, I didn't
wear pants for a month.

612
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,606
Seven weeks and two days, to be exact.

613
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,920
The man has no shame.

614
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,480
Well, you're a little lacking
in that area yourself, Arthur.

615
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,485
I laughed at the man with no pants

616
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,688
until I realized I have no legs.

617
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,601
For a minute,
I almost forgot my life is in ruins.

618
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,246
I'm sorry.

619
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,405
What for?

620
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,290
I'm gonna go to bed.

621
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,121
Good night.

622
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,804
- All right.
- Good night, Aurora.

623
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,925
She is wonderful.

624
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,125
Excellent choice.

625
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,601
Hello.

626
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,401
<i>Hi.</i>

627
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,041
Here you go.

628
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,249
<i>Is he asking me on a date?</i>

629
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,206
Do you need a pen?

630
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,604
She didn't seem that impressed.

631
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,888
"Love to." She wrote, "Love to."

632
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,530
<i>You have a visitor.</i>

633
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,406
Wow.

634
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,603
You clean up pretty good yourself.

635
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,367
You went shopping.

636
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,801
I went shoplifting.

637
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,247
Evening.

638
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,806
What can I get for you?

639
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,882
I'll have a Manhattan, please.

640
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,169
- Whiskey, rocks.
- Coming up.

641
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,050
You two look fine this evening.

642
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,926
Thank you, Arthur. We're on a date.

643
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,811
Very nice.

644
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,364
Took you long enough to ask.

645
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,171
I was giving you space.

646
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,160
Space.

647
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,561
The one thing I do not need more of.

648
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,365
That was so good.

649
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,960
It wasn't easy getting a reservation.

650
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,761
They're probably gonna want us
to give up our table.

651
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,176
- Mmm-hmm.
- I'm getting a lot of dirty looks.

652
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,080
Very popular tonight.

653
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,245
So how's your book coming?

654
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,448
I don't really know what it is yet.

655
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,602
My dad, he used to always
write about his life,

656
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,290
but he had stories.

657
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,204
He'd sailed around Antarctica.

658
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,440
He was a war reporter.

659
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,767
He had lovers.

660
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,520
He wrote about his daughter.

661
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,320
He wrote about you?

662
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,966
Yeah. I grew up reading
about myself in his books.

663
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,041
How was that?

664
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,607
Not always easy.

665
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,400
A little more than you wanted
to know about yourself.

666
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,651
And then, when I was 17,

667
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,970
he had a heart attack.

668
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,925
Right at his keypad.

669
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,330
End of story.

670
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,846
That was so serious. I'm sorry.

671
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,806
We need more wine.

672
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,405
I like hearing about your life.

673
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,410
Thanks.

674
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,171
Why are we here?

675
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,366
You'll see.

676
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,050
Best show in town.

677
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,930
So you've done this before?

678
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,280
Oh, yeah.

679
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,760
And it's safe?

680
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,008
No.

681
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,846
Reasonably safe.

682
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,682
Hop in. You're next.

683
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,281
What about my dress?

684
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,561
Right.

685
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,165
Turn around.

686
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,451
<i>Tether attached.</i>

687
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,044
<i>What are you doing?</i>

688
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,201
<i>Do you trust me?</i>

689
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,245
<i>Thank you.</i>

690
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,487
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

691
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,168
You kill me.

692
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,522
You okay?

693
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,011
Yeah.

694
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,449
I'm fine.

695
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,010
It's just...

696
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,164
Yeah, I know.

697
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,565
<i>So, I'm seeing someone.</i>

698
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,290
<i>You'll never guess who.</i>

699
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,963
<i>We're the last two people in the world
who would ever get together.</i>

700
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,324
<i>But here we are.</i>

701
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,811
<i>The last two people in the world.</i>

702
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,321
What's that?

703
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,845
I'm writing, Arthur. Hush.

704
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,204
<i>Jim and I live
in accidental happiness.</i>

705
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,250
<i>Like castaways,
making their home on strange shores.</i>

706
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,482
"Strange shores." I love it.

707
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,856
You do? You don't have to say that.

708
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,008
- I know.
- You're not gonna eat this.

709
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,851
Does that seem fishy to you?

710
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,967
Keep reading.

711
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,245
<i>It's funny.</i>

712
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,924
<i>We all have dreams.</i>

713
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,123
<i>We plan our futures
like we're the captains of our fates.</i>

714
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,570
<i>But we're passengers.</i>

715
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,608
<i>We go where fate takes us.</i>

716
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,041
<i>I can't</i>

717
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,200
<i>Help</i>

718
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,241
Arthur!

719
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,920
<i>This isn't the life we planned.</i>

720
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,010
<i>But it's ours.</i>

721
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,651
<i>And for the first time in my life,</i>

722
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,404
<i>I don't feel alone.</i>

723
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,362
<i>We weren't supposed to find each other.</i>

724
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,405
<i>But we did.</i>

725
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,170
<i>He makes me feel like my life isn't over.</i>

726
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,448
<i>Like it's just beginning.</i>

727
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,361
How was your day?

728
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,442
Good. I wrote a few pages.

729
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,763
Did you find anything that can help us?

730
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,204
- I did.
- Are they real?

731
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,610
I cut them myself.

732
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,011
Oh, wow!

733
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,600
You know, for two unlucky people,

734
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,051
we sure got pretty lucky.

735
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,045
<i>Attention.</i>

736
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,801
<i>You may wish to proceed to a viewing area.</i>

737
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,248
<i>The Avalon will slingshot
around the star Arcturus.</i>

738
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,765
Look!

739
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,683
Oh, my God!

740
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,844
That was amazing.

741
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,364
A red giant.

742
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,008
The universe's present to you.

743
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,851
What?

744
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,969
Happy birthday.

745
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:36,330
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

746
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,325
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

747
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,450
<i>Happy birthday, dear Aurora</i>

748
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,885
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

749
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,881
A birthday drink
for the birthday girl.

750
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,216
Aren't you going to ask for my ID?

751
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,416
I might not be old enough to drink.

752
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,920
Oh, I would never ask your age
in front of a gentleman.

753
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,850
Jim's no gentleman.

754
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,400
Anyway, there's no secrets
between me and Jim.

755
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,325
- Is that so?
- You heard the lady.

756
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,447
I will be right back.

757
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,411
This is a perfect birthday drink.
Thank you.

758
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,609
I remember this day a year ago.

759
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,728
Jim was so looking forward to meeting you.

760
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:32,921
What?

761
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,649
How could he be looking forward to it?

762
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,405
Oh, he spent months deciding
whether to wake you up.

763
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,806
He couldn't stop talking about you.

764
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,690
Jim woke me up?

765
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,851
Oh, yes.

766
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,484
He said it was the hardest
decision of his life.

767
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,126
But I see it worked out just fine.

768
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,771
What?

769
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,323
Did you wake me up?

770
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,121
Yes, I woke you up.

771
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,126
How...

772
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,046
How could you do it?

773
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,685
I tried not to.

774
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,805
I'm gonna be sick.

775
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,525
I can't see.

776
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,686
Aurora, please...

777
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,240
Stay away from me!

778
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,444
I can't get off this ship.

779
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,000
I can't get off this ship. I can't get off.

780
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:12,801
No!

781
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,287
Oh, God.

782
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,490
Can I talk to you?

783
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,804
<i>Aurora,</i>

784
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,163
<i>I know nothing I can say
will make this okay.</i>

785
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:52,971
<i>But please listen.</i>

786
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,881
I was so alone

787
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:57,530
for so long.

788
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,320
It felt like I was disappearing.

789
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:05,124
The night I first saw you,
I was ready to...

790
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,721
You saved my life.

791
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,089
<i>And I know that's no excuse for what I did.</i>

792
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,044
I read everything you wrote,

793
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:22,883
<i>and I fell in love with your voice</i>

794
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,010
<i>and with the way your mind works.</i>

795
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,561
<i>I fell in love with you.</i>

796
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,728
<i>And all of a sudden,</i>

797
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,890
it was like I... I wasn't trapped anymore.

798
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,163
My pointless life suddenly had meaning.

799
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,682
And I wish I could take it back.

800
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,730
<i>But I can't.</i>

801
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,725
<i>Aurora, I don't want to lose you.</i>

802
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,928
I don't care!

803
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,208
I don't care what you want!

804
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:57,126
<i>I don't care why you woke me up!</i>

805
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,285
You took my life!

806
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,884
<i>Please stand by.</i>

807
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,930
<i>Your suite's control center is rebooting.</i>

808
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,044
I envy you, Arthur.

809
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,761
How so?

810
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,004
You have a purpose.

811
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,681
You're always happy.

812
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,729
How's your book coming along?

813
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,209
I've never written about myself before.

814
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,776
I think it's some of the best work
I've ever done,

815
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,768
and I don't even know why I'm doing it.

816
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,844
There's only one person who could read it,
and I can't stand him.

817
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,568
They say time heals all wounds.

818
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,007
Broken hearts aren't that simple, Arthur.

819
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,251
You wouldn't understand.

820
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,570
Arthur!

821
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,724
Tuesday's my day with Arthur.

822
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,206
It's Wednesday.

823
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,481
The bar's all yours.

824
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,245
What'll you have? Whiskey?

825
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,405
Coffee.

826
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,091
<i>Aurora! We love you!</i>

827
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,280
<i>What are we gonna do without you?
We'll miss you so...</i>

828
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,445
<i>You're the bravest woman I know.</i>

829
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,931
<i>Bye, Aurora!</i>

830
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:28,001
<i>I promise that I will
think of you every day.</i>

831
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,208
<i>When you wake up, I'll be gone,</i>

832
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:33,807
<i>but just know that I will never forget you.</i>

833
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,530
<i>You're my best friend.</i>

834
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,444
<i>You were never happy here. I know.</i>

835
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,648
<i>Nothing was ever enough for you.</i>

836
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:45,288
<i>You know, you don't have to go.</i>

837
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:48,569
<i>You could do
whatever it is you have to do right here.</i>

838
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,281
<i>But, uh...</i>

839
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,049
<i>Since you're going, here's my wish.</i>

840
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:01,609
<i>I hope you finally find someone
who fills your heart, and</i>

841
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,248
<i>I hope you let him in.</i>

842
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,685
<i>I hope you realize you don't have to do
something amazing to be happy.</i>

843
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,766
<i>You know, have fun,</i>

844
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,244
<i>take chances.</i>

845
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,923
<i>Um, okay.</i>

846
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,805
<i>I love you, Aurora.</i>

847
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,846
<i>Bye.</i>

848
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,603
Morning, Arthur!

849
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,603
- Coffee, please.
- Coming up.

850
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,608
Are you soiling my barstool?

851
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:43,127
You want to make things,
you got to get your hands dirty.

852
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,200
And what have you been making?

853
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,051
Improvements.

854
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,042
<i>Grand concourse.</i>

855
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,486
<i>First floor.</i>

856
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,489
<i>Gold-class breakfast.</i>

857
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,644
<i>This is Deck Chief Gus Mancuso.</i>

858
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,284
<i>Who the hell planted a tree on my ship?</i>

859
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,643
- Who did that?
- I did.

860
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,241
Who are you?

861
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:22,601
Jim Preston.

862
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,241
Aurora Lane.

863
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,366
Anybody else awake?

864
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,965
Just me and him.

865
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,130
How far along are we?

866
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,160
Eighty-eight years to go.

867
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,763
Hibernation failure.

868
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,689
They said that couldn't happen.

869
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:50,003
Three people, three pod failures.

870
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,965
You have no idea
how long I've been trying to get in there.

871
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:00,361
Now that you're in, don't touch anything.

872
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,970
This is where you work?

873
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,281
No, this is flight crew. I'm a deck chief.

874
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,481
Hmm.

875
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,728
Ops, Navigation, Comm.

876
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,721
Hmm.

877
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:12,929
<i>Unauthorized personnel.</i>

878
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,647
Sorry.

879
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,363
If I'm reading this right,
we're still on course.

880
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:23,171
So whatever's wrong with the ship,
NavCom is still on the job.

881
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,736
There's something wrong with the ship?

882
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:27,206
Three pod failures?
Yeah, there's something wrong.

883
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,044
Question is what.

884
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,250
That's strange.

885
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,960
We should be getting diagnostics
from all over the ship right here,

886
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,843
but there's no data.

887
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,364
Got to check all the systems manually.

888
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,602
Can't we turn the ship around,
go back to Earth?

889
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,056
No, we're doing 50% of light speed.

890
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:47,401
Turning back would
take just as much time as going on.

891
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:49,240
Well, there's got to be
something we can do.

892
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,687
Sorry. We're going where we're going.

893
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,241
You okay?

894
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,289
Hibernation hangover.

895
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,010
Get it all the time.

896
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,169
<i>Grand concourse.</i>

897
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,446
Two years, huh?

898
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,443
Any more trees I need to know about?

899
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:06,521
Look out!

900
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,325
Never seen that before.

901
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,289
These robots have been breaking down.

902
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:18,011
This guy makes fifteen?

903
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:19,727
Fifteen.

904
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,245
The breakfast bar went crazy today.

905
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,641
- Yeah, and an elevator.
- Last week, my door broke.

906
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,927
- I was trapped in my cabin for two days.
- You were?

907
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,846
Things like that don't happen.
Not on this ship.

908
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,768
There are 16 of these tech stations
on every deck.

909
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:34,886
Dock your slate.

910
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,176
- Data syncs automatically. Got it?
- Hmm.

911
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,884
- Yeah.
- Okay.

912
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,407
You take decks one and two.
You take decks three and four.

913
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:45,405
I'm going down to the hibernation bay,
check our pods.

914
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,565
Well, that should be interesting.

915
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,000
Ain't you supposed to be
making your rounds?

916
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,440
I'm finished.

917
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,889
I checked your pod.

918
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,491
Problem's very simple.
The clock chip's burnt out.

919
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,325
It ain't supposed to happen,
but pretty simple.

920
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:14,890
My pod's more complicated.

921
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,850
Bunch of system failures that
all happened at the same time.

922
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,729
Whole damn thing went haywire.

923
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,929
Explains why I'm feeling so bad.

924
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,606
But Aurora's pod...

925
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,404
You did this.

926
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:34,841
Yeah.

927
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:37,366
All this time, I'm thinking
you're one lucky son of a bitch

928
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,090
to get stuck with Aurora.

929
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,403
It wasn't luck, was it?

930
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:45,961
No.

931
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,121
She knows?

932
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:48,966
She knows.

933
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,400
How long were you alone?

934
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,325
A year.

935
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,325
Still...

936
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,650
Damn.

937
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,090
<i>Data received.</i>

<i>Interpolating data.</i>

941
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:25,608
System shutdowns...

942
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,967
Everywhere, but no apparent connection.

943
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,285
You saw the hibernation pods?

944
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,401
I saw them.

945
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:35,647
<i>Data received.</i>

946
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,006
So you know

947
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,361
what Jim did.

948
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,691
Yeah.

949
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,481
And?

950
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:48,401
- It's not my...
- He woke me up.

951
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,445
He took away my life.

952
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,602
I know, and I'm sorry,
but there's work I'd...

953
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,444
It's murder.

954
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:58,930
You're right, Aurora.

955
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,607
But the drowning man will always try
and drag somebody down with him.

956
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:05,326
It ain't right, but the man's drowning.

957
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,044
This one makes 16.

958
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:13,681
Yeah.

959
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,689
Hey. You okay?

960
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,920
- You should go rest.
- Yeah.

961
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:28,083
But just a couple hours, and then back
at it first thing in the morning.

962
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:16,856
I was in the pool when
the gravity gave out.

963
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,006
Are you okay?

964
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,730
We need to find Gus.

965
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,962
<i>Gus! Gus!</i>

966
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:27,160
Gravity loss means that whatever's wrong
is starting to hit the big-ticket items.

967
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,440
Not good.

968
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,004
Every failure's a burnt out processor.

969
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,845
Everything on board's thinking too hard.

970
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,600
Why?

971
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:39,085
Computer, display these failures over time.

972
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,288
<i>Processing timeline.</i>

973
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,085
Cascade failure.

Seventeen failures in one day.

01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,608
Including hibernation pod 1498.

977
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:54,767
That's me.

978
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,885
Woke me up.

979
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,091
- What happened that day?
- Something big.

980
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,328
A major system went down somewhere.

981
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,087
Everything else on board
is trying to pick up the load,

982
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:07,889
but the load's too heavy.

983
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,803
Whatever started this, we got to find it.

984
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,007
And fix it.

985
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,411
How bad can this get?

986
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,007
Give me risk analysis based on this data.

987
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,127
<i>Extrapolating.</i>

988
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:20,326
<i>A mission-critical failure is imminent.</i>

989
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,370
<i>Failing systems.
Life Support, Fusion Reactor...</i>

990
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:24,606
So we're stranded.

991
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,648
<i>Hibernation Bay, Ion Drive...</i>

992
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,210
On a sinking ship.

01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:39,083
<i>Main Engineering.</i>

994
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:42,050
Not a lot of things big enough
to hit this ship that hard.

995
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,731
With Diagnostics out,
we'll have to find it ourselves.

996
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,323
Where do we start?

997
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,365

<i>Scan complete. Analyzing data.</i>

What's it say is wrong with me?

1000
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:06,444

Get me out of here.

1003
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:26,685
What's the prognosis?

1004
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:30,082
<i>Critical diagnoses cannot be
discussed without a doctor in attendance.</i>

<i>Progressive organ failure. Cause, unknown.</i>

1010
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:43,722
My goofy hibernation pod. That's the cause.

1011
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:47,244
- What's the treatment?
<i>- Various treatments are possible.</i>

<i>None will meaningfully extend
the patient's life.</i>

1013

1017
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:28,330

01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,256
Where could he be?

1024
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,524
Should've took the damn pills.

1025
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:23,011
- I'll go get them.
- No. Stay here with me.

1026
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,244
Sit down.

1027
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,642
You two take care of each other.

1028

Get you where you need to go.

1030
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,764
Fix the ship.

1031
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,002
Find out what's wrong with her.

1032
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:58,526
How do I look?

1033
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,529
You look magnificent.

1034
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,651
Ladies love the dress blues.

1035
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:15,281
What do we do now?

1036
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,086
This can't be good.

1037
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:29,164
I'm going back to Engineering.

1038
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:30,810
Can you fix this?

1039
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,885
I need your help.

1040
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:36,921
Let's go.

1041
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:00,927

1043
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:19,241
Yeah.

<i>Main Engineering.</i>

1045
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:25,528
Can't we wake up some of the crew?

1046
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,976
It'll take them too long to recover.
We don't have that kind of time.

1047
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,445
What are we even looking for?

1048
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:33,244
Something broken. Something big.

1049
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,526
Come on.

1050
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,281
Is it broken?

1051
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,522
It seems okay. What's next?

1052
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,967
Power plant. This way.

1053
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,444
Come on.

1054
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,456
The whole section's closed off.
Something's wrong.

1069
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:11,883
A hole in the ship.

1070
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:15,561
More than one.

1071
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:22,124
How did that even happen?
The ship's supposed to be meteor-proof.

1072
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:23,360
I guess one got through.

1073
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,521
It's hot.

1074
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:41,160
I think we found it.

1075
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,080
It's the reactor-control computer.

1076
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,570
This is what hit us two years ago.

1077
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:03,005
Jim...

1078
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:04,891
How can we fix this?

1079
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,761
We're gonna die.

1080
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,609
There's replacement pans for everything.

1081
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,443
- Light.
- Sorry.

1082
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:23,411
Soon as I pull this module,
the entire computer's gonna shut down.

1083
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:25,323
Well, what happens then?

1084
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,530
I'll get it back up as quickly as I can.

1085

Hurry!

1086
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,729

01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:14,049
The outer door is jammed.

1096
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:16,096
We've got to open that door
and cool the reactor down,

1097
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,485
or the whole ship is gonna blow.

1098
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:20,327
- How?
- I got to go out there.

1099
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,004
Open it from the outside.

1100
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,530
I open the door, I get clear.

1101
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:28,610
- You blow that fire into space.
- You get clear?

1102
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:30,250
You can talk to me through this.

1103
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,362
What happens to you when that door opens?

1104
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,365
Heat shield. It might help.

1105
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:55,250
You might need this.

1106
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:09,921
It's gonna be okay.

1107
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:21,321
I better go.

1108
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:29,086

01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:50,361
<i>I think I have to stay here.</i>

1139
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:52,251
<i>Hold the door open.</i>

1140
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:53,561
What?

1141
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:54,721
No!

1142
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,530
<i>No way! Get out of there!</i>

1143
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:58,125
<i>I can't.</i>

1144
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,565
<i>Jim.</i>

1145
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:00,921
<i>We're out of time.</i>

1146
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:05,246
<i>- Containment unstable.</i>
- Jim?

1147
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,127
<i>Vent the reactor.</i>

1148
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:22,407
<i>No! You don't understand!</i>

1149
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:25,891
<i>If I open the door right now,
it'll kill you!</i>

1150
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:26,961
<i>I'm hoping not.</i>

1151
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:28,923
Come back in.
We'll think of something else.

1152
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,411
<i>There is nothing else.</i>

1153
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:32,887
<i>Jim!</i>

1154
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,081
<i>- It's okay.
- No!</i>

1155
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:37,003
- It's not okay!
<i>- Aurora...</i>

1156
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:38,889
<i>Warning.
Temperature level exceeded.</i>

1157
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:40,969
This isn't what you said was gonna happen!

1158
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:44,005
<i>Aurora, this ship is gonna go.</i>

1159
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:46,082
I don't care! You die, I die.

1160
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:49,771
<i>There are 5,000 other people
on this ship, Aurora.</i>

1161
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:52,401
<i>We have to do this.</i>

1162
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,445
<i>Maximum pressure reached.</i>

1163
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,128
<i>Do it. Now.</i>

1164
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,882
<i>Maximum cabin pressure reached.</i>

1165
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:27,885
<i>Temperature dropping.</i>

1166
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:30,481
Jim.

1167
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:51,288
- Jim?
<i>- Vent successful.</i>

1168
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:53,886
<i>Rebooting process initiated.</i>

1169
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,320
Jim, please say something.

1170
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:34,284
<i>Suit pressure dropping.</i>

1171
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:40,206
<i>Return to ship immediately.</i>

1172
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,286
<i>Aurora?</i>

1173
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,961
It worked!

1174
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:47,405
You did it! You can come in!

1175
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:50,251
<i>Uh, yeah, about that.</i>

1176
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,448
What's the matter? Are you hurt?

1177
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:54,249
<i>I got blown out of the tube.</i>

1178
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:55,970
- What?
<i>- My tether broke.</i>

1179
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:58,242
<i>I can't get back to the ship.</i>

1180
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:00,763
I'll come out. I'll come out.
I'll pull you in.

1181
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:03,531
<i>Warning. Oxygen level critical.</i>

1182
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:05,848
<i>Return to ship immediately.</i>

1183
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:17,046
<i>Aurora, I'm sorry.</i>

1184
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:20,081
<i>For everything.</i>

1185
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:22,447
Shut up. I'm coming.

1186
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:26,605
<i>I wish we'd have met in 90 years.</i>

1187
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:34,964
<i>I'd... I'd have built you a house.</i>

1188
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,762
<i>I'd have read your book.</i>

1189
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:45,566
<i>It's gonna be great.</i>

1190

<i>Jim!</i>

1195
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:39,289
<i>I'm sorry. The patient is dead.</i>

1196
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:41,529
Well, resuscitate him!

1197
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:44,649
<i>Postmortem operations require
authorized medical supervision.</i>

1198

No.

01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:48,571

<i>Executing.</i>

1211
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:21,321
Hi!

1212
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:24,281
Jim!

1213
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:28,406
Hey, Jim.

1214
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,368
You brought me back.

1215
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,131
Yeah.

1216
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:26,328
- Thank you.
- Be still.

1217
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:27,926
Of course.

1218
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:15,164
There's something I have to show you.

1219
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:16,736
In command mode, it turns out

1220
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:21,004
the Autodoc has an option
called Stabilize and Suspend.

1221
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:23,647
It stops all metabolic activity.

1222
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:26,521
What are you saying?

1223
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:30,407
With Gus's ID, it can be like hibernation
inside the Autodoc.

1224
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:31,481
You can go back to sleep.

1225
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:38,483
But there's only one Autodoc.

1226
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,325
Yeah.

1227
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:50,405
And you're gonna lay down in it
and fall asleep.

1228
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:53,761
And you'll wake up on Homestead II.

1229
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,649
And you'll write your book.

1230
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:58,401
You'd finish your journey.

1231
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:00,369
You'd do what you set out to do.

1232
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,684
You'd be alone.

1233
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,729
I've been alone before.

1234
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:15,480
And I'll be fine.

1235
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:19,004
But I would never see you again.

1236
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:24,365
I'll come and visit you.

1237
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:09,050
Tuesday is my day with Arthur.

1238
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:12,725
Lovely as ever.

1239
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:15,041
Thank you, Arthur.
You're looking very well yourself.

1240
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:16,565
Thanks to you.

1241
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:18,561
What's that?

1242
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:23,602
Something I've wanted to give you
for a long time.

1243
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:32,564
It's beautiful.

1244
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:47,762
Took you long enough to ask.

1245
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:52,285
Champagne.

1246
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:53,887
I'll wait.

1247
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:12,969
Hell of a life.

1248
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:16,965
Hell of a life.

1258

<i>But we found each other.</i>

1260
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:28,089
<i>And we made a life.</i>

1261
