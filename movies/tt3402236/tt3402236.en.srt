2
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,240
He said
four minutes precisely.

3
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,560
Non, non, non.

4
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
Quickly.

5
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,233
Two
perfect eggs this time, no?

6
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,749
Ah.

7
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,069
Hmm.

8
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,319
Maybe.

9
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,393
I blame the chicken.

10
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,076
Why do hens lay eggs
of different sizes?

11
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,389
It's not you, mon ami.

12
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,152
These are two
perfectly good oeufs.

13
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,376
Mr. Poirot...

14
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,072
I've got three religions
bent on riot.

15
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,856
If you're going to perform
one of your miracles,

16
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,108
the time is now.

17
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,913
Have the eggs. Allons-y!

18
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,392
Poirot!

19
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,269
Sorry for the, um...

20
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,791
It is not the, uh...

21
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,590
It is the imbalance of the...

22
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,474
Right.

23
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,789
That's better.

24
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,936
Excuse me.
Coming through.

25
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,359
Make way, please.
Excuse me.

26
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,153
Please call for the accused.

27
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,953
The rabbi...

28
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,279
the priest...

29
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,639
and the imam.

30
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,832
It is like the old joke, yes?

31
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,150
The rabbi, the priest,
and the imam.

32
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,156
Forgive me,
I am Belgian.

33
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,992
So, let us begin.

34
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,833
In the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre above us...

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,833
three representatives meet
under the supervision...

36
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,592
of the Chief
Inspector of Police

37
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,831
to discuss a divided timetable
for market use.

38
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,637
One hour after this
tense meeting...

39
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,837
a priceless relic
is found to be stolen.

40
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,716
It is said, one of these
three men has stolen it.

41
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,833
The police find no pieces
of evidence at all.

42
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,719
I find one.

43
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,715
On the meticulously
well-kept wall of a fresco...

44
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,715
a single crack
from an indelicate climb...

45
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,510
with a hard-soled shoe
or perhaps a boot.

46
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,233
So, ladies and gentlemen,
we must ask...

47
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,392
who stands to benefit
from the crime.

48
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,232
Our three holy men
live humbly.

49
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,834
They're thin-soled shoes poor.

50
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,395
Sudden riches
and rubies would be...

51
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,438
too conspicuous, yes,
to enjoy. They do not gain.

52
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,433
At this point, we need an armed
guard at the south gate.

53
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,792
Thank you very much.

54
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,234
No, the only one...

55
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,235
who benefits from the theft
and the unrest it causes...

56
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,069
is a man whose office
I had searched this morning...

57
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,559
as I waited,
I have to tell you,

58
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,392
rather disappointedly
upon my breakfast.

59
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,915
Difficulty with eggs.
You don't need to know this.

60
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,550
A man who is paid lavishly
to keep order in Jerusalem.

61
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,233
I mean, of course,

62
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,914
the Chief Inspector
of the Police.

63
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,755
A man who does not wish
to lose a well-paid post...

64
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,518
when there is discussion

65
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,591
among the local peoples
of self-governance...

66
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,230
who does wear boots, and who,
I believe, now does regret...

67
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,312
inviting me to
consult on this case.

68
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,311
How dare you accuse me!

69
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,754
Please, Sergeant...

70
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,631
did you search
the office as I asked?

71
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,949
Uh, yes, sir.

72
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,588
And did you find
what I said you might?

73
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,955
Uh, yes, sir.
Just as you said.

74
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,189
Merci.

75
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Halt!

76
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,896
You need
to deliver that, Captain.

77
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,136
It should be through
first thing in the morning.

78
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,440
Very good, sir.

79
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,749
Luggage is on board, sir.

80
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,352
I won the right to escort you
to your boat.

81
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,191
To Stamboul, then?

82
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,999
Will you be back
to London straight off?

83
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,675
I am tired, and I have earned
myself a little holiday.

84
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,199
I want to look at paintings

85
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,874
and have too much time
on my hands.

86
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,191
You are staring.
Does it stop?

87
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,792
It's just...

88
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,712
How did you know
it was him, sir?

89
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,791
From just a tiny crack
on the wall.

90
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,474
I have the advantage...

91
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,552
I can only see the world
as it should be.

92
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,553
And when it is not,
the imperfection stands out...

93
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,998
like the nose
in the middle of a face.

94
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,354
It makes
most of life unbearable.

95
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,911
But it is useful
in the detection of crime.

96
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,310
But it's as though
you see into their hearts

97
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,675
and divine
their true natures.

98
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,235
And whatever people say,

99
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,232
there is right,
there is wrong.

100
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,038
There is nothing in between.

101
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,239
We must part here.

102
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,120
Oh, no, sir,
I'm to escort you on the ferry.

103
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,233
Au revoir, mon capitaine.

104
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,038
We must never meet again.

105
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,280
Could you straighten your tie,
please? Just a little.

106
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,078
Yes.
That is perfect.

107
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,352
Final passengers, please!

108
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,874
Oh, I'm sorry.

109
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,876
Will be fixed soon.

110
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,513
But, will it be
fixed in time?

111
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,669
We are working!

112
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,035
I have a connection
in Stamboul.

113
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,270
Leaves tomorrow at seven.

114
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,876
There's a very ill patient
waiting for me in London.

115
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,799
I am a doctor.

116
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,634
Doctor.

117
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,112
I am a doctor.

118
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,953
I am shouting at you
in English,

119
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,719
and now I'm doing it
louder and slower.

120
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,792
Very silly, forgive me.

121
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,633
May I help? Let me help.

122
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,310
I know your mustache.

123
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,471
From the papers.

124
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,755
You're the detective,
Hercules Poirot?

125
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,751
Hercule Poirot. I do not slay
the lions. Mademoiselle.

126
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,319
Mary Debenham, monsieur.

127
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,152
I'll forget a name
but never a face.

128
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,311
Not yours, anyway.

129
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,799
You come from Baghdad?

130
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,676
It's true. No detail
escapes his notice.

131
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,637
Your ticket.
Ah.

132
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,520
I might also ask you if you
enjoyed your time there...

133
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,079
as a governess?

134
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,832
The chalk on your sleeve
and the geography primer.

135
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,516
A governess or a cartographer.
I made my gamble.

136
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,119
I always begin them
with geography...

137
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,589
and monster them till they
have the world down cold.

138
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,830
They may get lost in life...

139
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,270
but I'll be damned if they
don't know where they are.

140
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,353
Well, our chains are free.
Right on time.

141
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,114
I feel so free
out here on the water.

142
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,316
I wish I could enjoy it.

143
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,879
We should be
out of this, Mary.

144
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,228
Not now.

145
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,311
When it's all over.

146
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,959
When it's done.

147
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,390
Then, nothing can touch us.

148
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,716
Ah,
my holiday begins here.

149
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,156
I can see the soul of the city
in these humble breads.

150
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,835
The world insists
on destruction, yet here...

151
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,714
masterpieces are baked
to order every day.

152
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,360
Monsieur Poirot!

153
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,113
Mohammed!

154
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
Mohammed, my friend...

155
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,197
you are an artist.

156
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,157
Ah! My friend!

157
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,799
Sorry.

158
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,678
Here. Come, come.

159
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,096
Don't mind us,
we're just looking

160
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,576
for a place to have
a private argument.

161
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,192
It should take
some 20 minutes or so...

162
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,336
at which point we will both

163
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,936
come to an agreement,
or at least I will.

164
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,154
Monsieur Bouc!

165
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,870
Poirot! In the kitchen?

166
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,996
Well, of course,
this man will sniff out

167
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,616
a perfect pastry
faster than he catches...

168
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
a jewel thief.

169
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,199
Mon ami!

170
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,839
Now, I am no longer
a policeman.

171
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,797
I cannot bail you out
when this goes badly, eh?

172
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,310
This is my dear, old friend,
the esteemed...

173
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,152
Poirot, who I knew
before the esteem.

174
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,468
Hercule Poirot, this is...

175
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
A prostitute.
She is.

176
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,439
I am. Bouc, you did not tell
me you had famous friends.

177
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,576
We're friends because

178
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,656
I'm the only person
who never asks him...

179
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,353
any questions about his cases,
because I don't care.

180
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,296
And he never judges me
for being a terrible person.

181
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,355
Indeed you are.

182
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,079
Madame, Bouc,
please join me for a drink, yes?

183
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,639
You only have me
for an hour.

184
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,677
I ride on the Orient Express
at seven,

185
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,432
official director business.

186
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,158
Uncle pays me absurdly

187
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,680
to stay onboard
his gorgeous train...

188
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,915
and far away from him...

189
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,195
at the home office...

190
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,833
consigned to wine and dine

191
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,320
handsome officials
for all eternity.

192
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,588
There is an art to nepotism.

193
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,716
And you are
its Michelangelo!

194
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Mr. Poirot.

195
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,040
Are you a prostitute as well?

196
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,479
Certainly not.

197
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,629
Is this man bothering you?

198
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,994
He is about to.

199
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,593
You are from
the British consulate.

200
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,352
I am, sir.
It is the Kassner case.

201
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,279
Why, yes.

202
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,237
I was correct
in certain predictions?

203
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,312
Quite.

204
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,040
I do not need
to read the telegram.

205
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,115
Oh, how fun.

206
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,759
Did someone cheat, or die?

207
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,433
Unfortunately, both.

208
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,399
Someone has...

209
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,194
interrupted my
longing for rest.

210
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,669
It appears that I must travel
with you tonight, Bouc.

211
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,751
Can you find me a cabin
on the Orient Express?

212
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,989
My friend...

213
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,991
I may not be good for much,
but I sure as hell

214
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,399
can get you a bed
on my train...

215
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,993
in the dead of winter.
Three days...

216
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,034
free of care, concern
or crime. You will love it.

217
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,834
Mademoiselle, it has
been a pleasure. Sir.

218
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,317
Your luggage
has been collected

219
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,958
and your expenses paid.

220
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,872
You will be met at Calais...

221
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,429
and then escorted to Dover,

222
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,670
and then by rail
to London Victoria.

223
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,233
I would like to formally

224
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,736
express gratitude.
Please, don't speak.

225
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,432
You make it worse.

226
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,640
Here's a tip for you, pal.
Thank you, Mr. Marquez.

227
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,976
I didn't even carry
your luggage.

228
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,149
Oh, I had a good week.

229
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,918
We celebrate
when fortune smiles,

230
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,797
and we share
the good fortune.

231
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,030
Remember to say nice things
about us Americans, huh?

232
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,835
No!

233
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,035
Hey, stop!

234
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,188
Monsieur, bonsoir.

235
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,554
For you, Mr. Ratchett,

236
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,471
the best table in the house.

237
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,272
Just here, sir.
The very best table.

238
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,192
No, I want that one.

239
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,438
Hey, Masterman.
You got everything?

240
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,670
Kind of you to inquire,
Mr. MacQueen.

241
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,591
I do not make mistakes.

242
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,669
Oh, my goodness!
It's Count Andrenyi.

243
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,909
Come, come, come.

244
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,833
I saw you dance
at the Monte Cristo.

245
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,717
Could I take your photograph?

246
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,712
Please, my face, no!

247
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,313
Sorry.

248
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,274
The Simplon Orient Express...

249
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,069
with stops in Sofia, Niš,
Belgrade, Vinkovci, Brod...

250
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,435
with transfers
to Bucharest, Zagreb,

251
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,192
Trieste, Venezia,
Milan, Lausanne...

252
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,510
Dijon, Paris,
Boulogne, Calais...

253
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,120
with connection
to Dover and London,

254
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,349
leaves in fifteen minutes!

255
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,630
This way, Michel!
Precious cargo.

256
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,358
I need
a first-class compartment.

257
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,437
Give special care
to my friend, Michel.

258
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,039
I want him pampered
like a zoo panda.

259
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,256
But Monsieur Bouc,
we are fully booked.

260
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,315
There's no space left.

261
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,360
Then we make space.
He can have the number eleven.

262
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,280
The eleven is always kept
open for official use.

263
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,719
It's very comfortable.

264
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,880
Eleven is taken.

265
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,296
The Austrian professor
booked it two days ago.

266
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,440
There is not one first-class

267
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,760
sleeper car
on the whole train?

268
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,800
Negative, sir.

269
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,076
Second-class?
There's no space left at all.

270
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,878
Mademoiselle Debenham.

271
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,957
Mr. Poirot,
are you joining us?

272
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,111
It depends
who wins this debate.

273
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,599
Have all the passengers
arrived?

274
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,314
All but one. Mr. Harris.

275
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,840
"All passengers
must check in

276
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,000
"at least one half hour prior
to time of departure...

277
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,758
"or their seat
may be forfeit."

278
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,388
The half hour has passed.
The seat is forfeit.

279
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,318
Please take
Monsieur Poirot's luggage

280
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,675
to number three
with Mr. MacQueen.

281
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,910
Merci, Bouc.
Enjoy, my friend.

282
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,479
Welcome, sir.
Merci.

283
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,914
Number three is unlucky.

284
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,395
Oh!

285
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,835
Apologies, madame.
I meant no disrespect.

286
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,798
Well, you could try to mean
a little.

287
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,716
One thing about train travel,

288
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,756
you're always
knocking into somebody.

289
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,075
It's wonderful.

290
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,595
Though, I am looking forward
to getting back.

291
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,712
Travel is fine for spicy food,
mosques, meeting men.

292
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,190
But eventually, you just
miss your own bed.

293
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:25,148
I've been accused
of husband hunting abroad.

294
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,112
Well, I can't,
in all honesty, deny it.

295
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,395
I like my time alone, I do.

296
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,630
But a lady has certain needs

297
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,439
that deserve to be met
if she has any money...

298
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,431
and preferably,
on a regular basis.

299
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,112
Oh!

300
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,434
Oh, my!
Fire in the kitchen!

301
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,397
Farewell, madame.

302
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,416
Good evening.

303
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
Bonsoir.

304
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,674
Number nine.

305
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,632
Good evening.
Bonsoir, bonsoir.

306
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,318
How you doing?
Bonsoir.

307
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,993
Oh. Excusez-moi.

308
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,798
No, after you.

309
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,154
Merci, merci.

310
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,474
Ah number three.

311
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,597
You are Mr MacQueen?

312
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,591
Yeah. I think you might
have the wrong berth.

313
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,189
Uh...

314
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,470
Sorry, is there a problem sir?

315
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,114
No, no problem.

316
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,656
The train is full.

317
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,470
I think that we are,
how do you say... "bunkies."

318
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,229
Really?

319
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,198
I am equally disappointed
in you. This is nice.

320
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,760
Come along, darlings.

321
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,669
No.

322
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,669
No.

323
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,349
This?

324
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,309
Why am I not yet unpacked?

325
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,872
Five minutes to departure.

326
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,996
Final call for passengers!

327
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,757
Shall we brush you?

328
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,673
What the hell
is taking them so long?

329
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,656
Soon as we get out of here,
have them make up the bed.

330
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,976
It's already arranged,
Mr. Ratchett.

331
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,309
No, I want the bed made.
And bring my Dictaphone.

332
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,194
Dogs on the table.

333
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,475
Most disgusting thing
I've ever seen in my life.

334
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,232
Yes, sir.
I want you to get MacQueen...

335
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,960
and have him bring every
receipt from the Milan sale.

336
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,520
I want you to get it done.
Yes, sir.

337
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,118
I want you to get it done now.

338
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,389
Did I say get it done now?
Right away, sir.

339
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,870
"Better watch yourself."

340
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,832
Your coffee, Mr. Ratchett.

341
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,594
Who did this?

342
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,591
I can't say, sir.

343
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,000
Good evening,
Mrs. Hubbard.

344
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,720
Hello there,
Mr. Masterman.

345
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,988
Well, hello.

346
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,839
Eyes linger any longer,
I'll have to charge rent.

347
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,072
I'll pay.

348
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,000
Mmm. Have another drink.

349
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,353
Are you insulted?

350
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,635
Hmm. Disappointed.

351
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,153
Some men have a good look.

352
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,117
All they have to do is...

353
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,633
keep their mouth shut,

354
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,597
and they can take home
any prize they want.

355
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,957
Still, the mouth opens.

356
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,553
Is everything all right,
Mrs. Hubbard?

357
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,757
You have a strong intuition,
I know.

358
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,832
My second husband
used to say just so.

359
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,992
Hold that, it was my first.

360
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Yeah.

361
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,037
Brightest man I ever met.

362
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,317
Face like a turnip,
but I loved that turnip.

363
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,831
It was nice to talk.

364
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,998
Good night.

365
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,280
Monsieur Poirot?

366
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,197
Entrez,
Pierre Michel.

367
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,600
Voilà.

368
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,631
When you take supper...

369
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,936
I will move Monsieur MacQueen

370
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,136
into Monsieur Bouc's
compartment.

371
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,752
You travel first class,
monsieur.

372
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,754
Ah, impeccable. Merci.

373
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,680
Bon appétit.

374
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
...and the eggs?

375
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,879
Good afternoon.

376
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,314
Ah, Mrs. Hubbard.

377
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,833
Good afternoon.

378
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,674
There we are.

379
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,671
Compliments
of the Orient Express.

380
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,273
Thank you, Mr. Bouc.

381
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,591
I am here
for all of your needs.

382
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,113
No, thank you.
I do not drink.

383
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,589
It does not
agree with you?

384
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,558
Sin does not agree with me.

385
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,951
Vice is where the devil
finds his darlings.

386
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,111
We should no longer speak.

387
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,632
Good afternoon.

388
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,351
Monsieur.
How about a apéritif?

389
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,238
I regret I have
an appointment

390
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,351
with the director
of the train.

391
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,909
He was gonna leave anyway.

392
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,072
Please, sir.
Madame, madame.

393
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,629
Madame, madame.

394
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,912
All settled in?

395
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,879
Ah, merci!
As advertised.

396
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,874
And yet, the best things
on the train are not food.

397
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,536
You know
there's something about...

398
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,232
a tangle of strangers
pressed together

399
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,856
for days on end,
with nothing in common...

400
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,871
but the need to go
from one place to another...

401
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,076
then never to see
each other again.

402
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,430
Boredom plus
anonymity plus a...

403
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,591
constant, gentle rocking.

404
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,273
With your hobbies, you will
never amount to anything.

405
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,919
God, I hope so.
Hmm.

406
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,433
Order me the fish.

407
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,435
Um, exchange grouper for sole,

408
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,074
escarole for the potato,
and...

409
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,433
the beef sauce
for the velouté.

410
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,394
Garçon, that sounds superb.
The same for me.

411
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,472
The Princess Dragomiroff.

412
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,952
You know, if I ever were
to marry for money,

413
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,553
I'd marry for
that much money.

414
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,948
I brushed Dalia this morning.

415
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,759
No, you tortured
my darling doggy.

416
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,148
I asked you to brush her.

417
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,470
Are you still enjoying
your Dickens?

418
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,471
Very much, mon ami.

419
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,551
You know, with your books
and your capers,

420
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,312
you are missing out
on romance.

421
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,948
Romance never
goes unpunished.

422
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,993
There was, uh...

423
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,799
There was someone once.

424
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,154
I would prefer, in the future,
to be sat not with that man.

425
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,749
Like should be seated
with like.

426
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,796
We are not alike.

427
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,273
Not all of us
are so concerned

428
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,794
with the separateness
of races, Professor.

429
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,190
It is out of respect
for all kinds

430
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,788
that I prefer
to keep them separate.

431
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,958
To mix your red wine
and the white

432
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,996
would be to ruin them both.

433
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,191
I like a good rosé.

434
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,751
Hey, how you doing?
Would you mind...

435
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,353
if I joined you?

436
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,795
Dessert is an indulgence...

437
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,919
and I feel kinda silly
and stupid indulging alone.

438
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,548
I am at my happiest alone.

439
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,474
But...

440
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,438
for a small piece
of your fragelité,

441
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,589
please join me.

442
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,196
Oh, with pleasure.
Excuse me, another fork?

443
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,936
I've been trying to make
your acquaintance, Mr. Poirot.

444
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,960
Merci.

445
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,388
I never ever sat so close
to fame before.

446
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,596
No, I tell a lie.

447
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,633
Once, I was on a bus
with Ty Cobb.

448
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,429
Ball player, Detroit.
Ah.

449
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,952
Would you mind if I have the
little curly bit at the top?

450
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,395
You're an odd bird there.

451
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,635
You're a strange,
peculiar man.

452
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,869
I am of an age

453
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,916
where I know what I like
and what I do not like.

454
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,958
What I like,
I enjoy enormously.

455
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,475
What I dislike,
I cannot abide.

456
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,154
For instance,
the temporary pleasantries

457
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,999
before what is determined
to be a business discussion.

458
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,119
You're fun.

459
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,475
All right.

460
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,830
I would like
to offer you a job.

461
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,676
"The avenger of the innocent."

462
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,136
It's what they call you
in the papers.

463
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,479
And you are an innocent?

464
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,272
I'm a businessman.

465
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,275
I'm an art dealer.
I mean, I'm new to it.

466
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,278
But my beginner's luck
has panned out.

467
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,752
Relics, antiquities.

468
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,117
Rugs, weird. Orientals.

469
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,517
I'm new to the game,
so I got the amateur eyeball.

470
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,514
But I got a little problem
with these, uh...

471
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,750
so-called appraisers.

472
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,871
You can't trust
a one of 'em.

473
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,991
Some of my customers...

474
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,189
they buy a piece...

475
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,478
they find out that they're
not exactly original...

476
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,033
which is hardly my fault...

477
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,875
if a Kashan silk scarf
is a fake.

478
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,109
Right? Huh?

479
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,508
C'est bon.

480
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,394
But I've managed to make
a few enemies, is the thing.

481
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,711
I got a few letters,
people making threats.

482
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,359
I think, most likely,
it's the Italians.

483
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,953
I sold them a set of
Oriental carpets in Milan.

484
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,074
And the buyers weren't
so happy with the provenance.

485
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,232
And they want their money back
with interest, you know?

486
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,320
Italians.

487
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,393
A guinea's a guinea.

488
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,995
And then comes along
the genius detective.

489
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,388
Me?

490
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,990
Yes, you. Hercules Poirot.
Hercule.

491
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,314
Um...

492
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,839
Here's what I'd like to do.

493
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,037
I would like to hire you
to watch my back...

494
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,270
until I get someplace safe.

495
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,750
It's easy money for you.

496
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,751
And it's peace of mind
for me, you know?

497
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,592
I understand.
Good.

498
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,760
I refuse.

499
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,876
I'm sorry? That's bad.

500
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,351
Maybe I didn't make
myself clear enough.

501
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,513
You see,
someone's out to get me.

502
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,559
And I know I'm not the best
guy born, not by a long shot.

503
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,352
And if there's a world
after this one,

504
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,715
I will face judgment
just like you.

505
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
But...

506
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,756
I ain't in no goddamn
rush to do it.

507
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,111
You're holding a gun on me?
No.

508
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,919
Not you. On the world.

509
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,469
I exist in the world.
Do not point a gun at me.

510
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,312
How's ten thousand
sound for a week?

511
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,520
It's a generous offer,
Mr. Ratchett. I must decline.

512
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,640
Fifteen thousand?

513
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,920
You didn't hear me. I decline.

514
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,473
Oh, I get it.

515
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:41,155
It's not flashy enough for the
great Hercules Poirot, huh?

516
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,389
No flashbulbs...

517
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,616
You sell fakes to gangsters.

518
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,278
You're suffering
the consequences.

519
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,556
I detect criminals.
I do not protect them.

520
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,236
So you say "no"
to my dirty money.

521
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,311
I say "no" to you,
Mr. Ratchett.

522
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,595
Business with the gun, right?
Is that what it was?

523
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,955
It is far more personal
than that.

524
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,671
I do not like your face.

525
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,991
If you will excuse me.

526
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,151
You liked my cake,
didn't you?

527
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,759
The cake was excellent.

528
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,274
Have a pleasant afternoon,
Mr. Ratchett.

529
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,034
Thank you.

530
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,269
Ooh! Cold.

531
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,355
Hmm.

532
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,275
Mysweet Katherine.

533
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,794
My love.

534
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,233
Mr. Dickens.

535
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,113
Mr. Ratchett?

536
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,032
Mr. Ratchett?

537
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,395
It's nothing.

538
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,071
Very good sir.

539
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,120
Good night.

540
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,280
Mrs. Hubbard?

541
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,231
It's always Mrs. Hubbard.

542
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,879
Mrs. Hubbard.

543
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,351
Did we die?

544
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,193
Ladies and gentlemen,
the train has been derailed.

545
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,496
Are you all right,
Mr. Marquez?

546
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,431
I'm fine. Thank you.

547
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,656
You'll be
safest in your cabins.

548
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,999
Mr. Bouc will speak
to you all...

549
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,195
in the morning.

550
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,656
Please, you will be safest
in your cabins.

551
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,874
Of course.

552
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,871
Are we gonna die?

553
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,389
Oh...

554
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,357
MyKatherine.

555
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,516
Mybeautiful...

556
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,710
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am afraid

557
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,314
that our train is still
unable to go anywhere.

558
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,549
Yeah, except down.

559
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,360
How long are we supposed
to just sit here?

560
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,869
Yes, someone must
be doing something.

561
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,918
Of course I am doing
something. I am doing nothing.

562
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,514
Precisely two hours
and ten minutes ago,

563
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,636
when we did not arrive
in Brod as scheduled...

564
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,920
the station master will have
surmised our situation...

565
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,713
and already dispatched a team
to excavate the engine...

566
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,110
clear our path,
and send us on our way.

567
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,474
Until then, I assure you...

568
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,030
we will all be made warm
and fed and comfortable.

569
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,880
We could walk.

570
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,673
We could die
of exposure trying.

571
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,751
I have a connection to make.

572
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,798
My boat sails day after
tomorrow from France.

573
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,556
Without you, I'd wager.
Or me in London.

574
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,235
I hold you accountable for
my loss of time, Mr. Bouc.

575
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,176
Madam, you cannot hold me
accountable for the weather.

576
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,270
Of course I can.
You're the one here.

577
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,556
And my conference
in Turin?

578
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,955
And I was to meet at
the auto factory in Sochaux.

579
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,869
Yes, some things,
they are in God's hands.

580
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,431
It is not for us to say...

581
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,030
if we deserve to arrive safely
at our destination...

582
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,034
or if, like Lucifer,
we must fall.

583
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,469
Breakfast for you,
Mr. Ratchett.

584
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,956
Ah, Bonjour,
Mr. Masterman.

585
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,879
There is a problem?

586
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,473
I can't say, sir.

587
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,073
Mr. Ratchett?

588
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,395
Excuse me.

589
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,793
That is cold air.

590
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,916
Please bring Monsieur Bouc
immediately,

591
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,956
and also Dr. Arbuthnot.

592
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,318
Good God!

593
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,835
Touch nothing else,
only the body.

594
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,390
My God,
this is horrible.

595
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,068
First the snow, now...

596
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,416
I'll have to meet
with the police

597
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,240
and make some statement
in some grimy station.

598
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,436
And a man has died.

599
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,753
And a man has died.

600
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,036
He was stabbed.

601
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,349
Long, straight-edged knife.

602
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,112
Multiple stab wounds,
some shallow,

603
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,719
some cut clean through muscle.

604
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,456
Left-hand side
or right-hand side?

605
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,198
That's the thing.

606
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,112
It appears the killer

607
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,555
maybe closed his eyes
and struck blind.

608
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,156
Can you estimate
the time of death?

609
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,675
It's hard
to say with the window open...

610
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,758
but my best guess
is between midnight and 2:00.

611
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,256
But no one went
in his compartment then.

612
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,395
I sat in my seat all night.

613
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,472
I would have seen if someone
went in. It's impossible.

614
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,176
Thank you, Doctor. Please,
return to the dining car.

615
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,191
Michel, secure this carriage.

616
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,839
Poirot.

617
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,076
I need your help, my friend.

618
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,913
You have to find
who did this.

619
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,195
Please, I implore you,

620
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,872
on behalf
of the Orient Express.

621
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
When the police arrive,

622
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,256
we can present them
with the case closed.

623
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,316
You are the only one
who can save me.

624
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,630
Your faith touches me,
mon cher.

625
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,472
But I must have this rest.

626
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,677
Well, think of it as a little
beachside puzzle.

627
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,757
That's nothing to your mind!

628
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,990
You look up the antecedents
of the passengers.

629
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,360
You establish
their bona fides.

630
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,550
Then you do what you do.
You... You... You...

631
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,072
You sit in a chair
and you eat your cake...

632
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,390
and you think until
the solution presents itself.

633
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,536
What else are you going to do
while we sit here in the snow?

634
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,680
Without constant
stimulation,

635
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,256
your little gray cells
will starve and die.

636
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,696
You think that is what I do?
I sit in a chair...

637
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,776
and I have
a little piece of cake,

638
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,096
and then I come up
with a great idea?

639
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,616
I don't know what you do.
I have my Dickens.

640
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,232
Damn your Dickens!

641
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,280
If we leave this
to the police,

642
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,480
they will choose a culprit...

643
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,710
right or wrong,
and they will hang him.

644
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,074
Most probably Mr. Marquez...

645
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,390
for no other reason
than his name is Marquez.

646
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,199
Or Dr. Arbuthnot for
the color of his skin.

647
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,717
You are the only one
who can bring justice.

648
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,016
Let me have a map
of this coach.

649
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,040
Of course.

650
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,120
Every passport.
Anything.

651
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,077
Interviews arranged
with all of our passengers.

652
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,277
Evidence, order and method,
until one culprit emerges.

653
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,277
I do not approve
of murder, my friend.

654
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,480
Every day, we meet people

655
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,656
the world could
do better without...

656
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,908
yet we do not kill them.

657
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,719
We must be better
than the beasts.

658
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,909
So let us find this killer.

659
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,633
What's going on?

660
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,998
Ladies and gentlemen,
allow me to, um...

661
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,799
It appears that our bad luck
has worsened.

662
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
That is...

663
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,152
A passenger has died
on the train.

664
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,958
Monsieur Ratchett.

665
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,838
Looks like they
got him after all.

666
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,956
You assume
he was killed?

667
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,678
No, no.

668
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,513
I just mean he was
in perfectly good health.

669
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,159
He had his enemies,
that's all.

670
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,351
Indeed, he did.
He was murdered.

671
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,793
Good God. Murder, here?

672
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,188
Alas, madame.

673
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,191
God rest his soul.

674
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,037
Someone was rummaging
around my cabin

675
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,394
in the middle of the night.

676
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,551
Nobody would believe me.

677
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,675
What is going on?

678
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,000
As we are snowbound,

679
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,360
I have elected
to take the case...

680
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,954
and find for my friend,
Monsieur Bouc, the criminal.

681
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,758
And why you?

682
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,757
My name is Hercule Poirot...

683
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,559
and I am probably the greatest
detective in the world.

684
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,416
I will speak
to all of you in time.

685
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,759
For the moment...

686
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,136
I must recommend
that you remain

687
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,696
in your compartments
with the doors locked.

688
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,392
I feel like a prisoner here.

689
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,949
It is
for your own safety.

690
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,236
If there was a murder...

691
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,391
then there was a murderer.

692
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,277
The murderer is with us...

693
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,110
on the train, now.

694
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,991
The doors between coaches
were locked at night, hmm?

695
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,991
Absolutely.
Done myself.

696
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,296
The train's
been searched.

697
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,696
There's no one hiding
on it or under it.

698
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,029
We can therefore
limit our investigation

699
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,554
to the occupants
of the Calais coach.

700
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,631
Bouc, you will assist me.

701
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,576
As the only traveler
who slept in another coach...

702
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,591
you are the only one
who is not a suspect.

703
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,670
Mr. MacQueen, is this
really the time for drinking?

704
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,592
My boss is dead.

705
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,398
I'm out of a job,

706
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,118
and you're looking at me
like I did it.

707
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,508
We make no accusations.

708
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,954
You knew him,
so from here

709
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,360
we must glean
the essential facts.

710
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,351
Were you his relative?

711
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,993
No, his secretary.

712
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,837
Book his travel,
order his steaks.

713
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,228
The man ate more steak

714
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,436
than I've ever seen
in my entire life.

715
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,750
He was in antiques.

716
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,478
He had no qualification
for it,

717
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,680
not the eye
or the languages.

718
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,670
Truth is, he had no head
for business, accounting...

719
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,159
none of it.

720
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,514
I took care of everything.

721
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,148
How long were you
in his employ?

722
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,153
Twenty days shy of a year.

723
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,949
Prohibition
wasn't to my taste...

724
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,912
so I found myself overseas,
and in debt.

725
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,794
I'm a lawyer by education...

726
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,791
not disposition.

727
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,110
I was downright awful at it.

728
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,154
You were fond of him?

729
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,709
I was fond of his money.

730
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,995
Ratchett was crude...

731
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:41,270
demanding, insulting,
and most likely a felon.

732
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,271
When did you
last see him?

733
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,351
It must have been
just after 10:00.

734
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,590
He called me in to go
over our sales in Italy.

735
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,354
Milan,
the sale of forgeries?

736
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,431
Yeah, yeah.

737
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,159
He wanted to look over
the accounts.

738
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,072
I had to translate
everything...

739
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,336
as the contracts
were in French

740
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,839
and he didn't speak a word.

741
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,033
And when we stopped
at Vinkovci...

742
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,794
I struck up a chat with
the colored doctor, Arbuthnot.

743
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,076
And we had a couple of drinks,
stretched our legs.

744
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,240
He had some...

745
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,109
odd opinions about Stalin
I had to turn around.

746
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,793
I don't hold
a man's race against him,

747
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,871
but I don't often
take to Britishers.

748
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,398
When did your party end?

749
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,358
He left just after 2:00.

750
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,953
Did you know
of any specific enemies

751
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,712
Ratchett might have had?

752
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,233
Gosh.

753
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,753
Pick a number.

754
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,639
He confided
he had been threatened?

755
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,518
He got a couple
of nasty letters.

756
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,990
I have them if you like.
Some, anyway.

757
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,310
He tore up the rest.

758
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,237
Threw them into the fire.

759
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,760
That's them.

760
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,996
Merci, Mr. MacQueen.

761
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,160
Uh, thank you.

762
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,496
If we have
any further questions,

763
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,317
we will call for you again.

764
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,320
Have you considered
the Latin man?

765
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,908
Marquez. Hell of a guy.

766
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,675
And, well, you know,
his kind...

767
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,274
they don't have
the same distaste for murder,

768
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,032
historically speaking.

769
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,033
You said you don't hold
a man's race against him.

770
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,349
I suppose...

771
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,591
depends on the race.

772
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,518
And he was doing so well.

773
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,438
You think it's MacQueen?
Too early to say.

774
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,675
I admit, I cannot see him

775
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,176
stabbing a man twelve times
in a frenzy.

776
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,633
Not sober, anyway.
Who did it then?

777
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,392
I do not know yet.
It is time we ask.

778
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,477
Ask who?
The victim.

779
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,918
He has
twelve stab wounds

780
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,736
and, as Arbuthnot said,
they are patternless.

781
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,909
If the doctor is guilty...

782
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,456
he certainly did not
let it influence

783
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,595
his responsibilities.

784
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,830
Hey, the watch.
Stopped at 1:15.

785
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,816
Now that agrees with the
doctor on the time of death.

786
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,920
Hmm. It is possible,
yes. Certainly possible.

787
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,096
I don't
quite understand.

788
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,416
I do not understand,
myself.

789
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,589
I understand nothing at all.

790
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,637
If you look
at these two wounds...

791
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,997
they are powerful and deep,
and yet there is little blood.

792
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,754
But this was
a frenzied attack.

793
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,598
Lashing here and there.

794
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,478
No pattern at all,
just extreme violence.

795
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,358
And during all this,
our victim,

796
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,510
vigorous and anxious
and full of coffee...

797
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:53,030
merely lies still and accepts
death without struggle...

798
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,953
when he also has here...

799
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,476
the means by which
he might defend himself.

800
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,792
For you.

801
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,520
Now, let us see here.

802
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,791
Barbital. The Mickey slipped.

803
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,315
Drugged him
so he couldn't use this.

804
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,955
And later around here,
a lady's handkerchief.

805
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,151
An objet de luxe, handmade.

806
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,633
Boom, two hundred francs
in Paris.

807
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,314
And she even has
an initial, "H."

808
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,879
And our little friend,

809
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,752
the pipe cleaner.
Another clue.

810
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,599
Yes, a riot of clues
dropped most conveniently.

811
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:34,430
Yet only one appears, however,
to be perhaps genuine.

812
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,039
And maybe
this ashtray provides

813
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,479
the accidental breadcrumb.

814
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,671
A charred fragment of a note.

815
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,991
An attempt, perhaps,
to burn evidence.

816
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,680
Merci, monsieur.

817
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,136
We may borrow
your equipment, yes?

818
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,160
Thank you.

819
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,479
Merci, merci.

820
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,074
Now,
I prefer to understand...

821
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,472
why a clue is left rather than
what the object is.

822
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,230
We seek the truth from
within, not without.

823
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,515
In this case, however,

824
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,474
I may welcome a little
scientific assistance.

825
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,195
You will adjust the flame.

826
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,759
It's just another one
of those nasty letters.

827
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,856
You are mistaken, mon ami.

828
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,075
This one has a secret to tell.

829
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,395
Look.

830
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,232
"As a strong blood
is on hand, you will die."

831
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,197
What does this mean?

832
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,272
Come with me, Bouc.

833
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,916
Let us fill in the gaps.

834
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,719
This was never
a beachside puzzle.

835
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,029
I know the dead man's
real name.

836
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,911
It is not Ratchett,
but Cassetti.

837
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,479
I know that name.

838
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,074
Then you will also know
the name Armstrong.

839
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,231
The Armstrong case?

840
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,431
The story
shocked the world.

841
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,600
Two years ago...

842
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,910
the renowned pilot,
Colonel John Armstrong...

843
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,479
and his wife, Sonia,

844
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,114
woke to find their
only child, little Daisy...

845
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,272
taken from her crib
as she slept.

846
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,629
Desperate...

847
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,597
the Armstrongs
paid the ransom.

848
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,799
But soon after,
Daisy was found murdered by...

849
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,589
Ratchett,
who was Cassetti.

850
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,876
Sonia Armstrong
was with child

851
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,632
when she received the news.

852
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,792
The shock sent her
into premature labor.

853
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,793
Neither she
nor her baby survived.

854
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,438
How do you know this,
Poirot?

855
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,955
Because John Armstrong
told me so himself.

856
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,951
He wrote to me to ask me
for my help.

857
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,111
By the time
I received his letter...

858
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,151
it was too late.

859
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,434
He was found dead
of a gunshot wound.

860
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,438
Self-inflicted.

861
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,992
"Daisy Armstrong's blood
is on your hands.

862
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,150
"You will die for it."

863
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,834
Indeed, you did.

864
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,831
Monsieur Poirot?
Yes, Michel.

865
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,672
Mrs. Hubbard wants
to speak to you.

866
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,671
I held her as best as I could.

867
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,119
Ah, Mrs. Hubbard,
I'm sorry to have kept you.

868
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,456
You have a head full of steam
and a mouth full of words.

869
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,710
You're goddamn right, I do.
What I have been trying...

870
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,711
to tell you all day.

871
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:37,555
The murderer was in
my compartment last night.

872
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,309
I thought I'd be killed.
Turns out I might have been...

873
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,233
only he got Ratchett instead.

874
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,680
I woke up in the dark,
and I knew

875
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,800
there was a man in my room.

876
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,471
You are certain
it was a man?

877
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,833
I know what it feels like
to have a man in my bedroom.

878
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,313
I told your conductor,
and he wouldn't believe me.

879
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,993
I said, "Check the
communication door

880
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,320
"between my room
and Ratchett's.

881
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,356
"He must have
left through there."

882
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,239
Sure enough, it was unbolted.

883
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,915
I know I locked it...

884
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,036
after what Ratchett said.

885
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,636
He made a rather
overt overture.

886
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,759
Have you perhaps...

887
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,559
heard of
the Armstrong kidnapping?

888
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,358
You couldn't avoid it.

889
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,794
Morbid stuff.

890
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,030
The child's murderer,
Cassetti...

891
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,671
died last night.

892
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,229
Ratchett was the man.

893
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,869
I told you, I knew he was
a rotten one.

894
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,360
You do believe me...

895
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,636
about the man in my room?

896
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,876
I'm aware you think
I'm a silly woman.

897
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,235
But I have proof it's true.

898
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,256
It is
from the uniform...

899
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,793
of an Orient Express
conductor...

900
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,096
but it might have
fallen from Michel's

901
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,348
when he was in your room.

902
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,715
I'm not missing any.

903
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,800
I found it

904
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,096
at the foot of my bed,
on the cover...

905
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,951
right where I slept.

906
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,120
What do you call that?

907
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,675
I call it evidence. Thank you
so much, Mrs. Hubbard.

908
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:07,840
Have you ever
been to America?

909
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,478
Once.

910
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,392
Years ago, briefly.

911
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,312
For what purpose?

912
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,596
To confirm a suspicion.
Which was?

913
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,159
That I wouldn't like it.

914
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,992
I was offered
a post in Boston.

915
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,832
Saw Boston,
went straight back to London.

916
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,319
Is that where
Ratchett was from?

917
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,719
Boston?
I can't says I know.

918
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,234
It wouldn't be proper...

919
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,039
to ask.

920
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,960
Carry on.

921
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,519
I last saw...

922
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,911
Mr. Ratchett at nine o'clock.

923
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:40,153
I brought his coffee
and hung up his clothes.

924
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,069
You have a toothache, I think.

925
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,070
I've got an extraction booked
in London this week.

926
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,755
Mr. Ratchett insisted on not
putting it off any longer.

927
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,120
He said
he was tired of hearing

928
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,269
my suppressed groans.

929
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,560
This sympathetic Ratchett...

930
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,280
was it his usual practice
to drink coffee at night?

931
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:04,718
Not at all. But he'd been
very agitated lately.

932
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,793
Said he wanted to stay alert,
especially so last night.

933
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,349
He found a letter
in his compartment.

934
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,551
Please tell me
you didn't do this.

935
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,216
If I were to leave
something unpleasant

936
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,355
on your pillow, sir...

937
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,152
it would not be a letter.

938
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,593
Coffee.

939
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,474
Surely, such a...

940
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,678
proper and precise valet...

941
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,751
would never speak
to his master as you did?

942
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,276
Unless he knew his career
was coming to a sudden...

943
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,759
end.

944
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,999
No mere toothache, I think.

945
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,309
The lungs?

946
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,718
The thyroid.

947
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,509
Spread now to stomach.

948
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,279
Same as got my father,
five years younger.

949
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,678
Months at best.

950
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,391
"Inoperable, I'm afraid,"
said the doctor.

951
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,552
And suddenly,
I wasn't... afraid.

952
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,437
I would only do what
I wanted from here on.

953
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,669
I speak my mind now.

954
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,394
The coffee.

955
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,036
It appears that his cup
was laced with barbital.

956
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,200
You, of course,
will tell me

957
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,336
that you did not
put it in there.

958
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,360
Of course I didn't.

959
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,994
When and from where

960
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,957
did you procure
the coffee and the cups?

961
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,759
In the kitchen, sir.

962
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:28,158
I ordered it at dinner to be
ready at 9:00, and so it was.

963
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,517
Anybody could have got
a hold of it before me.

964
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,228
Merci.

965
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,918
Mr. Masterman.

966
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,356
I'm sorry about the toothache.

967
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,274
Merci.

968
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,431
I love the little cakes.

969
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,194
So, Miss Pilar Estravados,
you are a missionary...

970
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,400
but you trained as a nurse

971
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,840
before you changed
professions, yes?

972
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,039
I owed it to God.

973
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,589
You owed Him a debt?

974
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,512
There were...

975
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,073
indulgent times in my life...

976
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,595
when I took more than I gave.

977
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,034
Gerhard Hardman.

978
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,873
Professor of engineering.

979
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,793
It is science
that will win back

980
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,598
for Germany her pride.

981
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,751
- Biniamino Marquez.
- Mr. Marquez.

982
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,069
Listen, I wanna be clear

983
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,600
of any association
with the crime...

984
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,755
so please ask me anything.

985
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,229
Anything. I never lie anymore.

986
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,391
Did you leave your compartment
at all last night?

987
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,711
Only once, to get an aspirin.

988
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,440
Mrs. Hubbard offered me
something earlier.

989
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,556
I declined at first,
but when I couldn't rest...

990
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,392
I went to ask for it.

991
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,790
My conference is in Turin.

992
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,837
I am the only Austrian
to present,

993
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,672
which means without me...

994
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,910
the talks will
be substandard.

995
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,354
Then I escaped prison,

996
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,078
and I bribed myself
into the US...

997
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,674
where I swore never
to lie or steal again.

998
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,216
You see, my friends,
because when people

999
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,639
trust you, they buy more.

1000
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,429
The Italians are cows.
The Spaniards, sheep.

1001
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,431
The Belgians...

1002
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,712
I come to my room,
which I share

1003
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,678
with the unhappy
English butler.

1004
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,195
A fish. He groans a lot.

1005
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:23,272
But I'm sure he saw me sleep
all night until morning.

1006
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,075
I should say...

1007
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,834
in case it is relevant...

1008
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,355
there was
an embarrassing moment.

1009
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,556
When I went to see
Mrs. Hubbard...

1010
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,591
first, I opened
the wrong door.

1011
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,078
Oh, sorry.

1012
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,389
What time was this?

1013
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,960
That must have been about...

1014
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,354
Don't be sorry.

1015
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,311
...twenty minutes to 11:00.

1016
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,151
This is interesting.

1017
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,469
As far as it is known,

1018
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,358
you are the last person
to see Ratchett alive.

1019
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,073
Your business?
Automobiles.

1020
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,633
I have three showrooms.

1021
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,917
I come to America
with nothing. And now...

1022
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,096
If what you say is true,

1023
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,176
Miss Debenham
will confirm it.

1024
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,111
But it is true.

1025
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:08,159
I would not lie.

1026
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,992
May it be possible
that Miss Debenham

1027
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,760
left your compartment
without you noticing?

1028
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,634
No. I sleep very lightly.

1029
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,832
The slightest sound
and I bolt upright.

1030
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,711
I was surprised once.

1031
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,277
Never again.

1032
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,357
No, I didn't say
I was a chauffeur.

1033
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,949
The photographs that
spilled out of your luggage...

1034
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,917
there was a beautiful one

1035
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,116
with a little boy
wearing a chauffeur's hat...

1036
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,673
visiting his papa at work.

1037
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,432
Who did you chauffeur?

1038
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,113
Miss Estravados,
why do your hands

1039
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,872
have the calluses
of a boxer?

1040
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,877
I do my work
in dangerous cities...

1041
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,955
where I cannot
be governed by fear.

1042
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,520
I trained to fight.

1043
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,272
But you do not trust
your god anymore...

1044
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,873
since your surprise?

1045
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,554
No, in case He is busy.

1046
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,792
God is always busy.

1047
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,919
It's Masterman.

1048
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,720
A man dying is a man
with nothing to lose.

1049
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,920
Bravo, Bouc. Except for
the problem of Mr. Marquez...

1050
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
who has now confirmed

1051
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,280
that his bunkmate,
Masterman...

1052
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,233
was reading in his bed
at the time of death.

1053
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,829
If it were easy, I would
not be famous. Next.

1054
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,440
Miss Debenham...

1055
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,238
you do not mind
to brace the air?

1056
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,958
For you, we have the picnic.

1057
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,714
While you made my roommate
suffer cramped quarters.

1058
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,869
I see.

1059
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,115
Choose the best location

1060
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,720
to extract the truth
from each suspect.

1061
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,831
Put her off-balance
and me, freeze.

1062
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,240
Clever.

1063
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,656
Will you write down
your full name

1064
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,352
and address, please?

1065
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,192
A pale mauve, by the way.

1066
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,679
Miss Estravados told me
you asked

1067
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,352
the color
of her dressing gown.

1068
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,553
Merci.

1069
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,029
"Mary Hermione Debenham."

1070
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,755
Do you ever go by Hermione?

1071
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,878
A constant Mary, when I'm not
employed as Miss Debenham.

1072
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,188
Left-handed.

1073
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,195
Unusual, I know.

1074
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:01,536
You mustn't have
your theory fixed

1075
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,232
if you're testing
my handwriting.

1076
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,391
What did you think
of the dead man?

1077
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,832
Uh, I can't say
I did think about him.

1078
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:11,936
I don't quite see
the point of your question.

1079
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:15,953
Oh, forgive me, mademoiselle,
my little originalities.

1080
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,874
Human nature is perverse
in its complexity.

1081
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:23,874
To plumb it,
it takes the right tools.

1082
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,758
These are toys,
not tools, Hercule.

1083
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,349
I prefer you put them away.

1084
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,198
The direct method? Parfait.

1085
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,590
You knew the doctor
before traveling?

1086
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:32,760
Dr. Arbuthnot?

1087
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,629
No.

1088
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,116
But such instant attraction?

1089
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,919
We are not in America...

1090
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,473
Miss Debenham.
There are no laws

1091
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,835
against what you may feel.

1092
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,311
Nor are there laws
against silence, of which...

1093
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,072
I hold my...

1094
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,715
I've never been to America.

1095
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:07,798
Perhaps I may ask
about some...

1096
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,154
words I overheard?

1097
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,151
You and the stranger,
Arbuthnot,

1098
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,310
are closer than strangers
might be.

1099
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,511
You said...

1100
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,958
"Not now. When we are done.
Then no one can touch us."

1101
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,758
What did you mean?

1102
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,919
You think I meant murder?

1103
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,878
To a man with a hammer,
every problem is a nail.

1104
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:30,718
You live crime.

1105
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,030
You see evil every day.
Not so.

1106
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,679
I see enough crime to know

1107
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,672
that the criminal act
is the anomaly.

1108
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,838
I believe it takes
a fracture of the soul...

1109
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,714
to murder another human being.

1110
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:49,078
I ask again,
what did you mean?

1111
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,271
As we established...

1112
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,313
there are no laws
against my silence.

1113
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,673
Very well.

1114
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,233
And afterwards,
Princess Dragomiroff?

1115
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,789
After dinner, I came to bed.

1116
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,513
God blessed me with long life,

1117
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,990
but cursed me with a bad back
to make it miserable.

1118
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,240
About a quarter to 1:00...

1119
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,833
I called for
Fräulein Schmidt.

1120
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,433
Mmm-hmm.
She massaged me...

1121
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,868
and read to me
for a while.

1122
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,791
- Then I sleep.
- Mmm-hmm.

1123
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,548
Were you ever acquainted...

1124
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:37,110
with a family
by the name of Armstrong?

1125
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,956
They endured
an unspeakable tragedy.

1126
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,596
I was an admirer of
Sonia Armstrong's mother...

1127
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,910
Linda Arden, the actress.

1128
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:57,112
A once-a-century talent.

1129
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:01,271
Miss Arden was to
turn to directing.

1130
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,672
She would have
become the first

1131
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,109
woman titan of Broadway...

1132
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,191
were it not for the tragedy.

1133
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,989
And this Linda Arden,
she is dead?

1134
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,991
She might as well be.

1135
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,552
She no longer
leaves her home.

1136
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,679
Daisy was my goddaughter.

1137
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,711
She was a...

1138
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,431
I don't see how this relates
to our troubles, Detective.

1139
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:42,195
The man killed last night,
his true name was Cassetti.

1140
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,432
The man who murdered
little Daisy Armstrong.

1141
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,352
I see.

1142
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:55,796
I admit I know this family,
and now this man is dead.

1143
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,755
The coincidence...

1144
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,195
must seem unbearable.

1145
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,992
You may be permitted
a coincidence.

1146
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:08,912
I must now ask a few questions
of your Fräulein Schmidt.

1147
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,456
No. There is no need.

1148
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,993
I can answer
to her character.

1149
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,156
Even still, if you will allow.

1150
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,677
Fraulein. Answer please in German.

1151
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,751
But her Excellency cannot comprehend me.

1152
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,193
That is the point.

1153
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,471
This is yours? H for Hildegarde?

1154
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,431
It is too fine for me.

1155
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,236
This is the truth about last night?

1156
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:42,717
As she said. She sent the conductor for me,

1157
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,474
then I returned to bed.

1158
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,560
Did you see anyone when you returned?

1159
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,592
Only the other conductor.

1160
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,056
"The other conductor."

1161
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,080
You mean Michel?

1162
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,040
No. A different
one than had awoken me.

1163
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:56,840
Please come with me.

1164
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,480
Are you sure
you did not see him?

1165
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:01,616
I'm certain.
The other conductor

1166
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,856
was a small man
with a short beard.

1167
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,096
Fräulein, there is
no other conductor.

1168
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,120
I know what I saw.

1169
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,696
I remember because
his voice was high

1170
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,016
and the uniform
was the same exactly.

1171
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,712
Though, I suspect,
missing one button.

1172
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,478
Sir, I need your
passkey immediately.

1173
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:15,428
We need to find a uniform
and a red kimono.

1174
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,039
Thousands
of photographs,

1175
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,120
endless pairs of socks...

1176
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,111
dressing gowns
in every color but red...

1177
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,111
and still no contraband
conductor's uniform.

1178
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,714
Have we checked
all the passengers' luggage?

1179
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,154
All except
for the Count

1180
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,480
and Countess Andrenyi,
monsieur.

1181
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,596
It is forbidden
to search their suitcases.

1182
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,557
They travel
under diplomatic visas.

1183
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,597
Where else could it be?

1184
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,991
There is one last suitcase
we have not checked.

1185
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,280
My own.

1186
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,310
The killer
is mocking me.

1187
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,232
Good. His first mistake.

1188
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,437
And as the night
must follow the day...

1189
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,636
Pardon, mademoiselle.

1190
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,789
No, it's not mine.

1191
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,736
I told you of the conductor.
Why would I tell you

1192
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,920
if it was me?
You would not...

1193
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,240
which makes your compartment
the ideal choice to hide it.

1194
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,554
Voilà, the button.

1195
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,359
And if a conductor's
uniform...

1196
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:14,594
why not a conductor's passkey?

1197
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,034
Now we know how the killer

1198
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,588
magically passed through
locked doors.

1199
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,632
Bourbon.
MacQueen.

1200
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,896
Now what are we
looking for now?

1201
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,148
500 pounds.

1202
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,469
MacQueen also had a ledger.

1203
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,913
All his dealings
with Ratchett.

1204
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,957
Where is it, hmm?

1205
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,200
Poirot?

1206
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,875
Bouc, keep everyone inside!

1207
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,553
Monsieur!
Please stop!

1208
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,240
Monsieur!

1209
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:21,914
Monsieur!

1210
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,393
Please stay
where you are.

1211
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:37,270
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.

1212
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,478
So, it was MacQueen?
You have your man?

1213
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,153
Pardonnez-moi, madame.

1214
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,231
How could he?

1215
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,520
I didn't kill him!

1216
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:55,816
You tried to burn
Ratchett's accounts...

1217
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,136
but they are still
legible in places.

1218
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,160
The maths do not tally...

1219
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,912
because you have been
stealing from him.

1220
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,559
It is full of the...

1221
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,991
- What is the English word?
- The chocolat?

1222
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,195
Fudge?
Fudge!

1223
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:07,429
It is full of the fudge!

1224
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,471
You stole from him!

1225
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:11,198
You thought
you would be found out.

1226
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,510
That is why you killed him!

1227
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:14,680
Yeah.

1228
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:19,276
Yeah, you're damn right
I stole from him.

1229
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:20,714
Thousands.

1230
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,479
I knew his money
wasn't honest.

1231
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:27,871
What did it matter if I
skimmed some off the top?

1232
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,992
But let me ask you a question.

1233
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:34,914
Why would I slaughter
my cash cow?

1234
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,308
I didn't do it.

1235
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,200
- I didn't kill him!
- He didn't.

1236
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,069
He didn't.

1237
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,718
I expect his alibi
revolves around me,

1238
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:43,960
drinking till
the early hours.

1239
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,120
Well, it's true.

1240
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:46,998
I saw him having whiskey,
and remarked

1241
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,957
on the lesser quality
of American liquor.

1242
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,120
He offered me a tipple

1243
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,713
to change my mind,
then another.

1244
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:55,118
We got to arguing politics.
He had some...

1245
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:57,518
tomfool opinions on Stalin

1246
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,480
I had to correct. But the
man knows his spirits.

1247
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,471
A word, please, monsieur.

1248
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,517
You can confirm you were
with him all night?

1249
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,750
We smoked and spoke
till nearly 2:00, yes.

1250
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,856
Ah, such chums, him with
his cigarettes, and you...

1251
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,269
Yes, you are the only man on
the train who smokes a pipe.

1252
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,396
May I see your pipe
and your tobacco, please?

1253
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:17,560
Of course.

1254
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:18,720
And you, Dr. Arbuthnot,

1255
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:21,400
were traveling from India,
I believe. Yes?

1256
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,391
You're interviewing me now?
Mmm-hmm.

1257
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,736
Were you ever in
Ratchett's compartment

1258
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,478
before he was killed?
Certainly not.

1259
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,720
But this is one of your
pipe cleaners, n'est-ce pas?

1260
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:32,395
If you found that in the dead
man's cabin, look elsewhere.

1261
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,794
I am a doctor, sir.

1262
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,240
I heal people.
I do not hurt them.

1263
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,078
About this, see,
you must have worked

1264
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,593
very hard to
become a doctor.

1265
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:42,116
Not many of your race
are allowed the opportunity.

1266
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,191
Middlesex Medical College
permits one per class.

1267
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:47,351
I had the honor in '24.

1268
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:51,274
I was a sniper in my tour.

1269
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,032
A sharpshooter.

1270
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,633
Saved more than
a few officers.

1271
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,760
The more grateful,

1272
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,416
recognized a fair mind
with a steady hand...

1273
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,271
and supported my education.

1274
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,839
I take their generosity
as a debt.

1275
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,150
Did you know
a Colonel Armstrong?

1276
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:06,278
Might have known
two or three Armstrongs.

1277
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:08,112
Tommy in the 60th...
Selby Armstrong...

1278
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,633
No, I meant
Colonel John Armstrong.

1279
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:10,994
He had an American wife,

1280
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:14,271
and his child was
kidnapped and killed.

1281
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,629
Oh.

1282
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,656
Never came across the fellow.

1283
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,796
When did you first meet
Miss Debenham?

1284
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,791
We met when we shared
the railway convoy car

1285
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,029
from Kirkuk to Nissibin.

1286
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,269
She claims otherwise,

1287
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,476
and she has made herself
problematically suspicious.

1288
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:27,640
Excusez-moi.

1289
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,552
Mary is a lady.

1290
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,136
Leave her out of this.
I can vouch for her character.

1291
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,151
As you vouched
for MacQueen's time?

1292
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,192
You won't listen to reason.
Never.

1293
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,672
You are lucky.
The good doctor insists

1294
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,512
he did not let you
out of his sight.

1295
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:47,233
See? There.
Couldn't have done it.

1296
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,469
Yes, you could.

1297
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,480
Ratchett took a sleeping
draught each evening.

1298
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:53,478
You could add barbital,
easily access that drug.

1299
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,680
Do the same with one
of the doctor's many drinks...

1300
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,120
and the chance
to kill him is clear.

1301
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,320
Why would I do any of that?

1302
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:59,656
We have established
your motive.

1303
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,671
Perhaps I will
suggest a different one.

1304
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,231
A different reason,
a more personal reason.

1305
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,233
"A lawyer by education,
not by disposition."

1306
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:12,392
Why did you pursue
the law, I wonder?

1307
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,070
Was it to appease
a much loved,

1308
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,475
but demanding father...

1309
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:24,632
one who himself had made
a great success

1310
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,073
in the same field...

1311
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:30,233
and then lost his position?

1312
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:34,477
There was a renowned
MacQueen, was there not?

1313
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:38,229
The district attorney for
the state of New Jersey...

1314
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,392
responsible
for the prosecution

1315
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,670
of the Armstrong case.

1316
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,989
They didn't have a suspect.

1317
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,912
My dad was pressured
to go after

1318
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,871
this poor French woman...

1319
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:59,073
a maid with a weak alibi,
Susanne.

1320
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:03,070
He hung his
whole case on her.

1321
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:07,198
She killed herself.

1322
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:10,033
She was innocent.

1323
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,397
By the time the evidence
lead to Cassetti,

1324
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,795
oh, he was long gone.

1325
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,753
They tore my old man apart.

1326
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,231
I couldn't do anything
for him.

1327
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,668
And yet you claim

1328
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,751
that you did not know
Ratchett was Cassetti?

1329
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,558
No, no.

1330
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:30,914
But you found him.

1331
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,040
No.

1332
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,080
You found him.

1333
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,240
You bled him dry...
No.

1334
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,675
in order to settle
your father's debts,

1335
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,876
and then finally,
to settle the score.

1336
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:40,399
No, no, no.

1337
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,471
No. It wasn't...

1338
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,518
It wasn't like that.
It's not the way...

1339
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,080
Someone kicked in the door...

1340
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:51,235
Doctor!

1341
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,958
covered my face.

1342
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:56,637
All right, this needs
to come out now.

1343
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,277
I want my bag.
Of course.

1344
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,629
It's in my compartment.

1345
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,720
There will be no fingerprints.

1346
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,600
The killer was disposing
of the murder weapon.

1347
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,473
It'sthere!

1348
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:23,118
The killer didn't hit
a lung or artery.

1349
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,713
She's lucky to be alive.

1350
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,273
You all are.

1351
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:27,440
Yeah, some genius!

1352
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,068
Why haven't you
solved this case?

1353
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,436
You must give the man
some time.

1354
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:33,794
Yeah, well...

1355
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,838
I can't give that much more.
I don't have any blood left.

1356
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Yeah.

1357
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:39,388
Accosting Mr. MacQueen,

1358
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,993
and the real killer
is right here.

1359
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,991
One of you people.

1360
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,840
I don't know who you are.
I said nothing.

1361
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,433
Please, leave me alone.

1362
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,040
Play something.

1363
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,151
My friends, the tracks will be
cleared by morning.

1364
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,918
Please, return to your rooms.

1365
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,080
I'm sleeping here...

1366
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,475
where everyone can see me
and I can see everyone.

1367
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,336
You should all do
the same. Conserve heat.

1368
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:03,113
Remain in the open,
safely in view, until morning.

1369
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,960
A killer will never
hesitate to kill again.

1370
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,470
I will convey the same message
to the Andrenyis...

1371
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,198
diplomatic immunity or not.

1372
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,600
If I may,
I will look at your passports.

1373
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,520
You know that
I must talk with her.

1374
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,176
By the way, there is a grease
spot on your wife's name.

1375
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,376
You might want
to look at that.

1376
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,879
Elena is not well.

1377
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,536
If you do not permit me,
your reluctance

1378
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:36,736
will be noted
to the Yugoslav Police...

1379
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:38,216
and I have no doubt that they
will arrest both you and...

1380
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:39,256
How dare you!

1381
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,679
Darling!

1382
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,115
Darling.

1383
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:52,233
You are funny-looking,
monsieur Poirot.

1384
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,755
Are all detectives
so funny-looking?

1385
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:00,676
I am sorry to wake you,
Madame la Comtesse.

1386
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,193
Hmm.

1387
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,236
I am always awake at night.

1388
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,277
In the day, I sleep.

1389
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:10,598
Some fear darkness,
but I cannot stand the light.

1390
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:12,716
You are always
under the influence of...

1391
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,720
Barbital.

1392
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,475
Barbital, barbital.

1393
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,556
I take oceans of it.

1394
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,390
Oh, there's no use
in a lie, love.

1395
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,596
He can see right through us.

1396
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,949
I cannot go outside
without it.

1397
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,275
I cannot sleep without it.

1398
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:37,951
I take it against my fears.

1399
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:44,760
What are you afraid of?

1400
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,508
Everything.

1401
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:58,916
Your passport has your
maiden name as Goldenberg.

1402
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,433
Jewish, yes?

1403
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,160
Not so Jewish.
My middle name isn't Maria.

1404
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,992
And you are a dancer
like your husband?

1405
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,111
No, not like my husband.

1406
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,316
Corps de ballet.

1407
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,595
He is touched by angels.

1408
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,637
I have been
shoved by passion

1409
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:15,399
and hard work to become adequate.

1410
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:19,871
Excuse me,
I must lie down again.

1411
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:23,000
Is this your only
dressing gown?

1412
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:31,833
No, I have another.
Corn-colored chiffon.

1413
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,639
I like speaking
to detectives.

1414
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,995
You never know what they're
going to ask you next.

1415
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,280
I'm particularly good
at capitals.

1416
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,237
My governess was a stickler
for geography.

1417
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:45,878
Are you satisfied?

1418
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:50,198
I am always satisfied
when I uncover a liar.

1419
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:53,989
Madame, your name is
not Elena. It is Helena.

1420
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:55,280
Despite your clumsy attempts

1421
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,510
to change it here
and on your luggage.

1422
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,456
My husband heard

1423
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:01,993
of a piece of evidence
found...

1424
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,752
a handkerchief embroidered
with an "H,"

1425
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,189
and didn't want
my "H" involved.

1426
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:09,830
So we changed it.
The luggage and the passport.

1427
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,309
It's no crime to want to
be distant from trouble.

1428
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:14,192
Yet, here is trouble.

1429
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,628
A curious detail

1430
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:18,188
about the Armstrong tragedy
at the heart of this case...

1431
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,915
is how many people
were wounded by it.

1432
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,877
The younger sister.

1433
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,917
The actress mother...

1434
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:29,351
stage name, Linda Arden.

1435
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,229
I suppose she, too,
was of Jewish ancestry...

1436
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,915
as who is most likely
to take a stage name?

1437
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:40,038
Is it too far to suggest...

1438
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,192
her original name
was Goldenberg?

1439
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,358
Especially when we find
a young woman,

1440
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,919
the same age...

1441
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,878
as her surviving daughter...

1442
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:54,270
living in a world of fear?

1443
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:58,077
The sister of
Sonia Armstrong.

1444
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,114
Get out!

1445
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:09,235
I hear noises and I run.
Just in time, yes?

1446
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:12,312
You must now believe the count
and countess are the killers.

1447
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:13,440
The count is protective.

1448
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,256
The countess would no sooner
kill a bedroom spider.

1449
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,475
And you may desist
with this charade.

1450
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,556
You are neither an Austrian,
nor a German, nor a professor.

1451
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,998
But a good imitation.

1452
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,270
Was it based on
someone you know?

1453
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:36,553
A local butcher where
I grew up was a Kraut.

1454
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:39,553
Good man, great accent.

1455
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,474
What was it?

1456
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,358
You said "Tur-in..."

1457
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:48,351
the emphasis
on the wrong syllable

1458
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,152
for a proud and proper Teuton.

1459
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,312
"Tu-reen."

1460
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:59,917
You are one sharp knife,
I give you that.

1461
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:08,155
Herr Professor
Gerhard Hardman...

1462
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,231
is my cover.

1463
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,834
I'm sorry about
the colored folks cracks.

1464
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,992
Hell, I'm half a Heeb myself.

1465
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,152
Cyrus Bethman Hardman.

1466
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,353
You are a Pinkerton detective?

1467
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:24,431
30 years.

1468
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,511
I was in Stamboul,
coming back from a job,

1469
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,635
when the office cabled.

1470
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:30,393
Ratchett asked for a man
to tail him,

1471
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:31,669
offering triple time.

1472
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,831
Lucky me being nearby.

1473
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,436
He told me to look out

1474
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:44,239
for a small, dark man
with a high voice.

1475
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,399
I watched that hall...

1476
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:49,438
all night through
a crack in my door.

1477
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,715
Any thug...

1478
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,235
had to go by me first.

1479
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:55,914
I'll take my oath on it.

1480
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,275
And would you
also take your oath...

1481
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:01,040
on your thirty years
as a Pinkerton Detective...

1482
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,758
or would you
lie to me again...

1483
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:06,435
and deny that you were,
in fact, a policeman first?

1484
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:10,036
Your gun, the checkered grip,
the blue finish...

1485
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:13,277
produced for
the Police Positive edition.

1486
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:16,079
1927 issue.

1487
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,760
It appears there are
no end to the lies

1488
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,472
manufactured just for me.

1489
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:24,073
You can leave your gun
as you go, Professor.

1490
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,913
From the position
of his cabin...

1491
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:51,997
it would have been
impossible to miss.

1492
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:57,835
Unless Ratchett's
door was open...

1493
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:01,953
as Pilar Estravados
claims she opened it.

1494
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:05,430
In which case,
someone could have been...

1495
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,989
masked from his view.

1496
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,274
My darling Katherine.

1497
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,634
This is an abominable crime...

1498
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,951
and I am stuck, ma Katherine.

1499
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,639
I cannot find
the crack in the wall.

1500
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,837
Why does one of them elude me?

1501
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,557
I have always been...

1502
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,158
so sure.

1503
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,232
Too sure.

1504
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,038
But now, I am very humble.

1505
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:51,628
And I say,
like a little child...

1506
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,156
I do not know.

1507
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,834
I am afraid, ma Katherine.

1508
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,016
My apologies,
ladies and gentlemen.

1509
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,268
It is not safe on board

1510
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:22,080
whilst the engine
is put back on the tracks.

1511
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:23,680
We are to wait in the tunnel.
Thank you.

1512
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,096
Where
are they taking the dogs?

1513
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,456
They'll be happy.

1514
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,549
That's not right.

1515
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:29,120
Just to stretch
their legs, it's good.

1516
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,077
No, that's not right.

1517
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,549
It's freezing!

1518
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,191
Are we stuck?

1519
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,430
You asked for me?

1520
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:39,755
Another interrogation?

1521
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,354
Oh, no. I enjoy your company.

1522
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,834
Merci, Bouc.

1523
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,115
Uh, please.

1524
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:49,354
I have a list of ten questions
I am no nearer to answering...

1525
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,431
and the train
is about to leave.

1526
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,795
You have a clear mind...

1527
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:57,714
and I thought that you might
produce an insight. Please.

1528
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,714
Hmm.

1529
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:05,352
"The handkerchief.
The pipe cleaner.

1530
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:09,195
"The scarlet kimono.
The uniform.

1531
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,555
"The time on the watch.

1532
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:15,554
"Was he murdered then?
Earlier or later?

1533
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:18,149
"By one person or more?

1534
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,038
"Which of them?"

1535
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:24,798
Sorry, I can't help you.

1536
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,394
Uh... Merci.

1537
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:30,536
Perhaps there is
an eleventh question

1538
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:31,879
you don't know to ask yet...

1539
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:34,235
that will give you
the answer to the rest.

1540
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,714
Perhaps.

1541
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:40,833
I could point an easy finger
at the, uh, Countess Andrenyi.

1542
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,434
I discovered she was
Sonia Armstrong's sister.

1543
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,953
Are you certain?
Yes.

1544
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:46,798
I suspect she may
perhaps be innocent.

1545
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,353
Perhaps.

1546
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:49,919
But so many people
have lied to me

1547
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,296
on this train
and do not seem to mind.

1548
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:52,673
You yourself did
so effortlessly.

1549
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:53,760
Me?

1550
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,632
You told me you had
never been to America.

1551
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,034
You also concealed the fact

1552
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,296
that at the time
of the tragedy...

1553
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,356
you were living
in the Armstrong household...

1554
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,919
as governess
to their daughter.

1555
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,069
And you know this.

1556
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,117
I have my living to get.

1557
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,200
A girl detained in connection
to a murder case...

1558
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:08,912
no decent class family
would engage me.

1559
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:11,799
Miss Debenham,
you planned Ratchett's murder.

1560
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:14,030
And then you sent for
the countess to witness it.

1561
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,679
If she saw him dead,

1562
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,273
the Helena you knew
might return.

1563
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,600
You waited for your roommate
to sleep, but she did not.

1564
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:20,720
You drugged her.

1565
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,176
But the barbital only
gave her a headache.

1566
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,536
She begged for an aspirin
when the train stopped,

1567
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,120
when the conductor was
on the station...

1568
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:26,336
when the coast
was clear at last...

1569
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:27,456
when you were allowed to enter

1570
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:28,680
Ratchett's compartment,
unseen.

1571
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,990
You loved Daisy Armstrong.
You killed Cassetti.

1572
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:36,672
Cassetti was a pig.

1573
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,598
He deserved to die.

1574
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,032
She didn't kill him.

1575
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:52,878
I did.

1576
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:58,913
Mary, go.

1577
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:01,598
I can't let you
take the blame...

1578
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,193
for what I did alone.

1579
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:10,392
Mary, please, go.

1580
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:15,473
John Armstrong
was my best friend,

1581
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:17,232
my commander.

1582
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,952
He believed in me.

1583
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:25,110
He sent me to medical school,
gave me a future.

1584
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:28,629
Cassetti destroyed him.

1585
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:32,990
In grief, I found Mary.

1586
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,636
Then I found Ratchett.

1587
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:40,510
Our plan was to reveal him
to the police,

1588
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,716
that's what you heard.

1589
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:46,314
But when I saw his face...

1590
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:50,470
I knew he didn't
deserve a trial.

1591
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:54,196
So, you drugged MacQueen.

1592
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,430
You changed the time
on the watch...

1593
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:59,558
so that you could lie
about the time of death.

1594
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:02,154
I couldn't let Mary
be accused.

1595
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:03,594
Or MacQueen.

1596
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:08,476
My sins are mine
to pay for, alone.

1597
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:10,798
I'm a soldier.

1598
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,518
A soldier kills to protect.

1599
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:14,913
And now, Mr. Poirot,

1600
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,479
I must protect myself
from you.

1601
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,713
Why aren't you dead yet?

1602
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:36,517
Poirot?

1603
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,797
Gentlemen, stop!

1604
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,233
Sir, we need to get
all the passengers

1605
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:56,799
back on the train.

1606
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:00,190
You will retire...

1607
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,436
away from the train...

1608
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,833
until I tell you to return.

1609
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,917
You tell your lies...

1610
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:29,915
and you think
no one will know.

1611
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:33,148
But there are two people
who will know.

1612
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:35,437
Yes, two people.

1613
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:37,799
Your God...

1614
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,355
and Hercule Poirot.

1615
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:48,357
It is time to solve this case.

1616
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:13,313
Dr. Arbuthnot asked me
why I was not yet dead.

1617
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,795
He knew, of course,
the answer.

1618
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:20,039
A sharpshooter who does not
kill at close range?

1619
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:24,997
Your shot was not a mistake.
It was a surgery.

1620
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:28,438
You could not kill me
because you are no killer.

1621
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:32,035
None of you are killers.

1622
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,514
And yet, someone must be.

1623
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,834
There are two possible
solutions to this crime.

1624
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:43,936
One difficult,
because it fits with most

1625
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:45,109
but not all of the facts...

1626
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,032
and one more...

1627
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:48,872
complex.

1628
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:51,831
The first solution.

1629
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,718
Ratchett had enemies.

1630
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:56,838
A rogue Mafioso steals
onto the train at Vinkovci...

1631
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:59,229
as MacQueen
and Arbuthnot take the air.

1632
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,753
Equipped with a uniform

1633
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,432
and a passkey,
he stabs Ratchett.

1634
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,556
He leaves through
Mrs. Hubbard's compartment,

1635
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:05,789
and makes his escape.

1636
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,080
No.

1637
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,638
No, no, no. It doesn't work.

1638
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:13,231
Why hide the uniform, hmm?

1639
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:15,312
Who drugs Ratchett?

1640
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,516
Or stabs Mrs. Hubbard?

1641
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,632
Damn it, man!

1642
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,439
So I ask,
who stands to benefit?

1643
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:27,714
This crime is the murdering
of a murderer.

1644
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:30,635
The benefit is, perhaps...

1645
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:34,556
to the spirit,
an ease of suffering.

1646
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:37,949
To quiet a shouting voice

1647
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,190
in the head
that prevents sleep.

1648
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:49,029
There is a murderer among us.

1649
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:51,480
So...

1650
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,069
We have Dr. Arbuthnot,

1651
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:56,589
a dedicated, grateful friend
to Colonel Armstrong.

1652
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,313
He meets and finds solace

1653
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,320
in the company of the
governess, Mary Debenham...

1654
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:04,079
who is almost like a mother
to the little girl.

1655
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:08,995
And so close to
Mrs. Armstrong's young sister,

1656
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:11,071
Helena Goldenberg...

1657
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:13,708
married to a powerful man

1658
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,075
no stranger
to rage and violence.

1659
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:20,274
We travel also
with Daisy's godmother...

1660
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:23,273
to whom belongs...

1661
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:25,311
the monogrammed handkerchief

1662
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:28,637
found at the scene
of the crime.

1663
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,837
The letter "H"
in the Russian alphabet,

1664
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,480
of course, pronounced "N."

1665
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,834
Natalia Dragomiroff.

1666
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,639
And her devoted maid
with a chef's eye?

1667
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,280
Who was she before
her current employ?

1668
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,470
Might I suggest
the Armstrongs' cook?

1669
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,557
But we are not yet done.

1670
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:50,837
The nurse
in charge of Daisy...

1671
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,592
her newfound religious zeal

1672
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:54,318
born of guilt
at allowing her charge...

1673
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,436
to be abducted.
It was you, was it not...

1674
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:57,669
in her room the night when

1675
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:59,352
Ratchett came in
through the window?

1676
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:02,439
Did you have
a glass of wine too many

1677
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:03,680
with your supper that night?

1678
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:05,552
Have you blamed yourself
ever since...

1679
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,278
for not being alert
to stop him?

1680
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:10,199
She knew nothing
but kindness...

1681
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,516
and love, until...

1682
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:18,270
until I...

1683
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,996
No need
to divine with me, sir.

1684
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:25,075
I was Colonel Armstrong's
batman in the war.

1685
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:29,196
And afterwards,
his valet in New York.

1686
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:33,153
As fine a man
as God ever made.

1687
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:35,356
Would his chauffeur agree?

1688
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,476
Was it a bank loan,
secured by Armstrong,

1689
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:39,232
allows him to build
his automobile empire?

1690
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:41,994
He's indebted for life.
Who else can we count?

1691
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:43,718
What of
the Pinkerton detective,

1692
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:44,994
once a police officer...

1693
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:47,355
assigned to
the Armstrong case?

1694
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,835
And he becomes attached
to someone,

1695
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,798
for there is another,
uncelebrated victim.

1696
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,632
You fell in love with the maid

1697
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:56,790
before she was
falsely accused.

1698
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,560
You quit the police
when you witnessed...

1699
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:00,676
the travesty ofjustice...

1700
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:03,752
when MacQueen's father
insisted on her arrest.

1701
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:06,275
When she took her own life.

1702
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,556
No! No, no!

1703
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:12,752
Susanne was so gentle.

1704
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,030
And she fell for me.

1705
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:17,757
Old and already getting grey.

1706
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,796
I told her
she could do better...

1707
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,592
but there she was...

1708
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:27,430
on time for every date.

1709
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:29,909
Why else is a train...

1710
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,356
so full in the dead of winter?
Why the inconsistent wounds?

1711
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:36,637
Why the abundance
of evidence? Why...?

1712
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:40,435
Why the conductor?

1713
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:43,158
Pierre Michel of Avignon...

1714
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:47,310
who lost his sister...

1715
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:50,076
the accused maid...

1716
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:53,109
Susanne Michel.

1717
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,117
Only one soul can
claim to have lost

1718
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:02,111
more than any of you.

1719
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:05,158
The tragic Linda Arden...

1720
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:07,390
mother of Sonia...

1721
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,795
grandmother of Daisy.

1722
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,110
Retired from the stage...

1723
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:16,190
but for one final performance.

1724
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:40,198
You're an awfully clever man.

1725
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,390
A murder should
have one victim.

1726
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:49,597
When Ratchett kills
Daisy Armstrong...

1727
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:54,880
a dozen lives are broken,
deformed, ended.

1728
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,679
They demand justice!

1729
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:01,756
Of all these wounded souls,
we must finally answer...

1730
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:04,912
who among them is a killer?

1731
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:08,914
Who takes up the knife?
The answer is...

1732
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:17,351
No single one of you
could have done it.

1733
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:19,518
Nor any pair.

1734
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:22,520
It can only have been done...

1735
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:24,911
by all of you.

1736
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:27,074
Together.

1737
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:31,553
Together.

1738
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:34,956
Even when the avalanche
changes everything...

1739
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:38,874
as does the detective,
plans must change.

1740
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,600
The kimono, the uniform.

1741
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:42,988
A remarkable improvisation,

1742
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:45,116
the doctor who knows how to
wound without killing.

1743
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:47,276
Each has their part to play.

1744
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:48,919
Do it.

1745
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:50,872
It was my plan.

1746
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:54,156
I recruited them.

1747
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:57,194
I had Hardman
track down Cassetti.

1748
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:58,998
I sent MacQueen
to work for him,

1749
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:00,758
and then Masterman.

1750
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,280
MacQueen could arrange

1751
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,271
he travel on the day
that Michel was on duty.

1752
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:48,120
Mr. Ratchett?

1753
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:52,954
It's nothing.

1754
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,270
Bien, monsieur.
Good night.

1755
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:58,232
And so it is done.

1756
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:01,714
For the death of the innocent.

1757
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:04,716
A life for a life.

1758
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:08,398
Revenge.

1759
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,911
No one should
hang for this but me.

1760
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:14,469
It was my plan!

1761
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:18,678
Tell the police
it was me, alone.

1762
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:21,832
There's no life
left in me anymore.

1763
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,992
They have a chance now.

1764
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:26,593
Helena, I pray...

1765
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,431
has a chance.

1766
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,313
They can...

1767
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:36,431
go live...

1768
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:38,911
find some joy...

1769
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:40,599
somewhere.

1770
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:44,955
Let it end with me.

1771
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:50,236
They're not killers.

1772
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:54,109
They're good people.

1773
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,635
They can be good again.

1774
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,956
There was right,
there was wrong.

1775
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,431
Now there is you.

1776
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:13,635
I cannot judge this.

1777
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,677
You must decide.

1778
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:19,280
You wish to go free

1779
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:20,760
without punishment
for your crime...

1780
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:25,029
then you must only
commit one more.

1781
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:28,113
I will not stop you.

1782
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:33,994
You can't let them kill you.

1783
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:36,949
You give my body
to the lake,

1784
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,793
and you walk away innocent
at the station.

1785
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:42,352
You must silence me.

1786
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,678
Bouc can lie.

1787
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:46,992
I cannot.

1788
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:54,669
Do it! One of you!

1789
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:56,639
Don't.

1790
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:59,953
I already died with Daisy.

1791
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:02,320
No!

1792
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:48,358
You said your role
was to find justice.

1793
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:50,909
What is justice here?

1794
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:56,234
Sometimes, the law of man
is not enough.

1795
01:39:58,120 --> 01:40:00,236
Where does conscience lie?

1796
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:05,558
Buried with Daisy.

1797
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:35,910
My dear
Colonel Armstrong.

1798
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:40,071
Finally, I can answer
your letter...

1799
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:43,277
at least with the thoughts
in my head

1800
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:45,789
and the feeling in my heart...

1801
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:49,396
that somewhere,
you can hear me.

1802
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:51,873
I have now discovered

1803
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:54,520
the truth of the case,
and it is...

1804
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:57,319
profoundly disturbing.

1805
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:01,835
I have seen the fracture
of the human soul.

1806
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:07,308
So many broken lives,
so much pain and anger...

1807
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:11,439
giving way to the poison
of deep grief...

1808
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:15,036
until one crime became many.

1809
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:18,710
I have always wanted
to believe

1810
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:22,509
that man is rational
and civilized.

1811
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:26,116
My very existence depends
upon this hope...

1812
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:31,638
upon order and method
and the little gray cells.

1813
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:35,951
But now, perhaps,
I am asked...

1814
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:38,630
to listen, instead...

1815
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:41,675
to my heart.

1816
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:49,318
Ladies and gentlemen...

1817
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:55,072
I have understood in this case
that the scales of justice...

1818
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:57,993
cannot always be
evenly weighed.

1819
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:01,549
And I must learn, for once...

1820
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:04,871
to live with the imbalance.

1821
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:08,875
There are no killers here.

1822
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:12,396
Only people who deserve
a chance to heal.

1823
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:14,719
The police have accepted

1824
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:16,239
my first solution
to the crime...

1825
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:19,517
the lone assassin
who made his escape.

1826
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:24,029
I will leave the train here
to conclude formalities.

1827
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:27,151
You are all free to go.

1828
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:31,353
And may you find
your peace with this.

1829
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:35,518
May we all.

1830
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,200
Hello.

1831
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:55,434
I'm looking for
a Mr. Poirot.

1832
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:57,272
He's needed
on a very urgent matter.

1833
01:44:57,360 --> 01:45:00,397
Ah. He is on holiday.

1834
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:04,876
The, uh, Kassner case again?

1835
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:07,508
No, sir, far worse.

1836
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:09,557
I have to take him
to Egypt straight away.

1837
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:13,395
There's been a murder, sir,
right on the bloody Nile.

1838
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:18,117
Are you the detective?

1839
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:20,828
Yes.

1840
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:25,195
I am the detective.

1841
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:28,075
Could you please
straighten your tie?

1842
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:33,194
I will see you at the car.

1843
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:31,473
Here you are, sir.

1844
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:33,949
Merci.

1845
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:35,269
Allons-y.

1845
01:46:36,305 --> 01:47:36,755
