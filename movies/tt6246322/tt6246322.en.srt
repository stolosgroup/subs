3
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:15,134
Yes.

4
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:23,401
You failed.

5
00:03:23,534 --> 00:03:24,567
I didn't.

6
00:03:26,734 --> 00:03:28,667
The gun is in my hand.

7
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:31,234
I thought I had it.

8
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:35,601
Sorry, Father.
I'll make it next time.

9
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:37,933
Never take anything
for granted.

10
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:40,567
God will take it from you.

11
00:03:42,634 --> 00:03:43,834
Is God bad?

12
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:48,434
God is fair.

13
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:55,067
You almost got
me, didn't you, boy?

14
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:17,567
Did I get my white hair from you

15
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:18,900
or from Mom?

16
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:22,967
From your mother.

17
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,033
I can't believe we don't have
any pictures of her.

18
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:28,300
Everything was destroyed
in the fire.

19
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,967
You know that.

20
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,834
I could only save you.

21
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,734
Was she beautiful?

22
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:44,334
She was smart.

23
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,267
Like you.

24
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:50,734
How many did I get?

25
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:52,234
All of them.

26
00:04:54,734 --> 00:04:57,701
So I get to go
to town today, right?

27
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:02,234
You failed survival.

28
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:05,834
It's been three months.

29
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,667
Plus, I just gave you
a killer haircut.

30
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:12,367
Trust me.

31
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,167
You need to pass
all your tests first.

32
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:02,142
All right,
apart from the usual,

33
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:04,843
I have an order of
five ferns,

34
00:06:04,975 --> 00:06:06,142
two ficuses,

35
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:08,642
and the <i>Columnea grandiosa.</i>

00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:10,975
<i>Gloriosa.</i>

37
00:06:11,108 --> 00:06:13,075
<i>Gloriosa.</i>

38
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:14,975
Am I taking Phoenix today?

39
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,142
Not today.

40
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,975
It's been a while.

41
00:06:18,108 --> 00:06:19,375
I said, no.

42
00:06:23,943 --> 00:06:25,642
You either loosen up
that leash,

43
00:06:25,776 --> 00:06:28,209
or sooner or later,
she's gonna bite it off.

44
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:43,576
Go with Hernandez.

45
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,776
Back by sunset!

46
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,175
I will.

47
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:56,876
Hey, Hernandez.

48
00:06:57,008 --> 00:06:58,709

I think my mom sang it to me

I snap my fingers

and he'll bite

105
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:30,309
I'll see you around.

106
00:11:30,442 --> 00:11:32,075
Come on, Shadow.

107
00:11:39,476 --> 00:11:40,909
You okay?

108
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:41,975
Yes.

109
00:11:42,108 --> 00:11:43,642
Just a weirdo.

110
00:11:43,776 --> 00:11:45,609
Yeah.

111
00:11:45,742 --> 00:11:48,309
No shortage of those
around here.

112
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:03,442
Follow them.

113
00:12:13,975 --> 00:12:15,809
Thanks, Hernandez.

114
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,342
We had a lot of fun today.

115
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:20,776
I'll take her again next week
if you're okay with it.

116
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:22,142
No.

117
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,709
Today was enough.

118
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:32,275
- It's none of my business, but...
- You're right.

119
00:12:33,642 --> 00:12:34,843
It's not.

120
00:12:37,776 --> 00:12:39,309
You're a bad man.

121
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,275
A man who's done
terrible things.

122
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,742
At least, I know you think that.

123
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:54,175
Just like sometimes
I do about myself.

126
00:13:03,975 --> 00:13:05,609
Don't make her pay for that.

127
00:13:09,642 --> 00:13:10,876
Thanks.

128
00:14:22,776 --> 00:14:26,809
You mind moving your vehicle
off the road, please?

129
00:14:26,943 --> 00:14:28,342
This is...

130
00:14:30,676 --> 00:14:33,375
This is the only road
back to town.

131
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:35,809
You served?

132
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:37,509
Yeah.

133
00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:38,909
We all did too.

134
00:14:40,142 --> 00:14:42,142
- Iraq?
- Yeah.

135
00:14:42,275 --> 00:14:46,342
Dishonorably discharged
from a dishonorable war.

136
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:52,776
I'd say that makes us
honorable somehow. Wouldn't you?

137
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:54,175
No.

138
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:59,142
Can you move your truck
off the road now?

139
00:15:02,742 --> 00:15:04,609
Sure, baby.

140
00:15:04,742 --> 00:15:06,809
Whatever you want.

141
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:21,709
Lessons next month.

142
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:24,175
Okay.

143
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:27,776
I wanna go to school next year.

144
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:30,008
- This is school...
- A real school,

145
00:16:30,142 --> 00:16:31,476
with other kids like me.

146
00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:33,142
Homeschool is safer.

147
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:35,108
I don't wanna be safe.

148
00:16:35,242 --> 00:16:37,975
I wanna be normal.
I wanna have friends.

149
00:16:38,108 --> 00:16:40,442
- I wanna live a...
- Enough!

150
00:16:40,576 --> 00:16:41,809
Enough.

151
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:46,275
I already lost a daughter once.

152
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:48,042
I'm not losing you.

153
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:49,776
But I'm lonely.

154
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:54,242
You have no idea
what it is to be alone.

155
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:57,509
You have me.

156
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:02,975

166

172
00:30:45,742 --> 00:30:48,342
Stay still.

173
00:30:52,576 --> 00:30:53,943
Breathe, brother.

174
00:31:11,943 --> 00:31:13,943
The guy's a Navy SEAL.

175
00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:31,008
Fucking dead SEAL, bro.

176
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:33,576
Better get out of there, kid.

177
00:32:45,576 --> 00:32:47,975
He's down there with you!

178
00:32:48,108 --> 00:32:50,843
Blind fuck is down there!

179
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:09,509
Call Raylan.

180
00:33:45,209 --> 00:33:47,843
Metal box
is almost full of water.

181
00:33:51,142 --> 00:33:52,876
You prefer
to see the kid alive...

182
00:33:55,476 --> 00:33:56,975
you come in here.

183
00:34:00,008 --> 00:34:01,476
You think I'm fucking with you?

184
00:34:06,108 --> 00:34:07,375
No.

185
00:34:09,509 --> 00:34:11,876
There's a live wire
about to reach the water.

186
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,876
Come out, or she's fried!

187
00:34:29,476 --> 00:34:30,843
Clever fuck.

188
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,342
No guns, huh?

189
00:34:34,576 --> 00:34:35,943
No problem.

190
00:37:11,442 --> 00:37:12,676
You're tough.

191
00:37:14,142 --> 00:37:15,776
But you're done.

192
00:37:27,709 --> 00:37:28,776
What the fuck?

193
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:30,309
Yo, bro.

194
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,309
Breathe.

195
00:38:51,442 --> 00:38:52,642
Come on, breathe.

196
00:38:52,776 --> 00:38:55,676
Breathe.

197
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:57,008
Breathe.

198
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:05,375
The old blind man did this?

199
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,975
Uh-huh.

200
00:39:09,909 --> 00:39:11,008
Let's go.

201
00:39:27,642 --> 00:39:29,275
I can walk.

202
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:30,876
I said, I can walk.

203
00:39:34,075 --> 00:39:35,476
What's happening?

204
00:39:47,142 --> 00:39:48,275
Cover the exits.

205
00:40:00,709 --> 00:40:02,676
What the fuck?

206
00:40:30,175 --> 00:40:31,809
They're still down here.

207
00:41:02,242 --> 00:41:03,509
What's happening?

208
00:41:04,975 --> 00:41:07,108
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

209
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:54,108
You don't need to be
afraid, little girl.

210
00:41:56,209 --> 00:41:59,175
This has all just been
one big misunderstanding.

211
00:42:10,843 --> 00:42:12,975
It's not me
you need to be scared of...

212
00:42:19,576 --> 00:42:21,975
but the man
standing next to you.

213
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:26,843
Now, I don't know who he is.

214
00:42:30,242 --> 00:42:31,609
But I know who he's not.

215
00:42:40,776 --> 00:42:42,242
Should I tell her or you?

216
00:42:49,542 --> 00:42:51,342
Finish him, bro.

217
00:42:51,476 --> 00:42:53,108
No!

218
00:42:53,242 --> 00:42:56,342
- Dad! Dad, wake up.
- Aren't you something?

219
00:42:57,876 --> 00:42:59,008
Let me go!

220
00:43:01,108 --> 00:43:02,175
Come on.

221
00:43:03,275 --> 00:43:04,175
No, it's okay.

222
00:43:08,242 --> 00:43:10,108
Yeah, there you go.

223
00:43:10,242 --> 00:43:12,476
There you go.

224
00:43:12,609 --> 00:43:14,843
You really don't remember me,
do you?

225
00:43:16,275 --> 00:43:17,975
Maybe this will help.

226
00:43:28,642 --> 00:43:29,776
See?

227
00:43:34,676 --> 00:43:35,876
What...?

228
00:43:38,776 --> 00:43:41,642
Years ago, there was
a fire in our house.

229
00:43:41,776 --> 00:43:43,843
Cops blamed me.

230
00:43:43,975 --> 00:43:45,342
I spent eight years in prison,

231
00:43:45,476 --> 00:43:47,342
wondering if
I'd ever see you again.

232
00:43:51,476 --> 00:43:53,609
I didn't even know
if you were dead or alive.

233
00:43:58,642 --> 00:44:01,342
<i>This creep here must have...</i>

234
00:44:01,476 --> 00:44:03,342
<i>found you
and kept you for himself.</i>

235
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,943
<i>Up next in local news,</i>

236
00:44:07,075 --> 00:44:10,075
<i>a meth lab caught fire
in west Detroit this morning.</i>

237
00:44:10,209 --> 00:44:12,843
<i>Police were able
to arrest the primary suspect.</i>

238
00:44:12,975 --> 00:44:15,843
<i>The man was taken into custody
and could face charges</i>

239
00:44:15,975 --> 00:44:17,709
<i>for a large number of crimes
committed</i>

240
00:44:17,843 --> 00:44:20,342
- <i>over the past several years.</i>
- <i>You have no idea</i>

241
00:44:20,476 --> 00:44:23,108
<i>how much I've been waiting
for this moment.</i>

242
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:39,876
Did he hurt you?

243
00:44:42,242 --> 00:44:43,776
But he did steal you
away from me,

244
00:44:43,909 --> 00:44:45,843
and now he must die,
you understand?

245
00:44:48,042 --> 00:44:49,609
Kill him.

246
00:44:49,742 --> 00:44:51,742
- No.
- Fuck are you doing?

247
00:44:51,876 --> 00:44:54,409
Not in front of my kid.
Do it outside.

248
00:45:00,108 --> 00:45:02,742
Wake up, you blind fuck.

249
00:45:04,075 --> 00:45:06,975
Oh! Fuck!

250
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,709
Fucking coward.

251
00:45:37,642 --> 00:45:40,142
Take her to the truck
while I hunt this motherfucker.

252
00:45:40,275 --> 00:45:41,975
Let's go.

253
00:45:47,609 --> 00:45:50,242
- Let me go!
- What's wrong with you?

254
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:51,642
Fucking wanna go home?

255
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,476
I don't care who you are.

256
00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:22,309
I'm gonna teach you
some fucking manners, yo.

257
00:46:22,442 --> 00:46:25,375
You ungrateful, little bitch.

258
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,476
No.

259
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,342
Stop.

260
00:46:54,476 --> 00:46:56,275
Please!

261
00:46:56,409 --> 00:46:58,075
Stop!

262
00:47:13,242 --> 00:47:14,776
Move. Go, go.

263
00:47:14,909 --> 00:47:16,943
Move. Now.

264
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:16,425
Move!

265
00:48:28,792 --> 00:48:30,325
I'm sorry, man.

266
00:48:33,492 --> 00:48:35,058
- He's back in the house.
- I know.

267
00:48:35,192 --> 00:48:37,158
He wants us to follow him.

268
00:48:39,492 --> 00:48:41,459
Enough of these silly games.

269
00:48:58,893 --> 00:49:00,392
It's his jacket.

270
00:49:02,492 --> 00:49:03,692
Attaboy.

271
00:49:03,826 --> 00:49:04,726
Attaboy.

272
00:49:06,726 --> 00:49:07,726
Wait.

273
00:49:07,859 --> 00:49:09,058
Stop.

274
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:12,659
Is it true?

275
00:49:12,792 --> 00:49:13,859
Move.

276
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,425
What's my real name?

277
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:16,759
Get over here now!

278
00:49:16,893 --> 00:49:18,225
When's my birthday?

279
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:20,225
- My real one?
- Stop it!

280
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:21,659
No, you stop it!

281
00:49:31,325 --> 00:49:33,058
Go!

282
00:50:41,325 --> 00:50:42,392
Hey.

283
00:52:02,325 --> 00:52:03,993
Phoenix!

284
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:06,859
Calm down, girl.

285
00:52:09,325 --> 00:52:10,559
Calm down.

286
00:52:30,859 --> 00:52:32,025
Stay.

287
00:52:47,492 --> 00:52:49,025
Put her in the truck.

288
00:53:12,526 --> 00:53:13,993
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

289
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:18,092
What are you doing?

290
00:53:18,225 --> 00:53:20,726
- Your dog's in there.
- Dog's dead.

291
00:53:20,859 --> 00:53:22,392
You don't know that.

292
00:53:22,526 --> 00:53:24,392
You wanna go and find out?

293
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:22,726
No!

294
00:57:17,626 --> 00:57:19,392
Good morning, princess.

295
00:57:27,792 --> 00:57:29,092
How you feeling?

296
00:57:34,158 --> 00:57:35,325
You all right?

297
00:57:37,292 --> 00:57:38,692
Wanna sit with me?

298
00:57:40,459 --> 00:57:42,325
Come, sit with me. Come on.

299
00:57:43,659 --> 00:57:45,559
Yeah.

300
00:57:45,692 --> 00:57:47,192
There you go.

301
00:57:47,325 --> 00:57:48,359
There you go.

302
00:57:49,526 --> 00:57:50,792
Yeah.

303
00:57:57,192 --> 00:57:58,492
Door's open.

304
00:57:59,926 --> 00:58:01,492
Not a prisoner anymore.

305
00:58:03,192 --> 00:58:05,859
You mean, I can go?

306
00:58:07,626 --> 00:58:08,893
If you want.

307
00:58:10,959 --> 00:58:12,659
Or you can stay here

308
00:58:12,792 --> 00:58:14,659
and find out
who you really are.

309
00:58:23,058 --> 00:58:25,392
Do I have
any brothers or sisters?

310
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:29,592
Unfortunately, no.

311
00:58:32,025 --> 00:58:33,893
When's my birthday?

312
00:58:34,025 --> 00:58:35,425
February 20th.

313
00:58:37,792 --> 00:58:39,592
What was my mother's name?

314
00:58:41,792 --> 00:58:43,058
Josephine.

315
00:58:44,425 --> 00:58:45,859
Do I look like her?

316
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:50,492
Yeah.

317
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:54,459
You do.

318
00:58:56,859 --> 00:58:58,025
Tara.

319
00:58:59,259 --> 00:59:00,692
That's your real name.

320
00:59:02,492 --> 00:59:03,626
Tara.

321
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:07,459
Everything that man
told you is a lie.

322
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:10,225
What happened to him?

323
00:59:11,692 --> 00:59:13,058
He got what he deserved.

324
00:59:15,292 --> 00:59:18,225
Hey. I'm not sorry.

325
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:20,259
You shouldn't be either.

326
00:59:20,392 --> 00:59:21,659
I wanna go.

327
00:59:22,993 --> 00:59:24,759
Where? Where you gonna go?

328
00:59:24,893 --> 00:59:26,993
There's a shelter I know.

329
00:59:28,492 --> 00:59:30,058
Like I said,

330
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:31,993
you're not a prisoner anymore.

344
01:02:06,025 --> 01:02:07,359
Mom?

345
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:10,626
Like I said...

346
01:02:11,959 --> 01:02:13,626
everything he told you
was a lie.

347
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:27,692
My Tara?

348
01:02:32,726 --> 01:02:34,192
You...

349
01:02:34,325 --> 01:02:36,993
got so big, heh.

350
01:02:41,058 --> 01:02:42,492
Can I hug you?

351
01:02:48,726 --> 01:02:50,058
Come here.

352
01:02:51,626 --> 01:02:53,225
Oh, God.

353
01:02:55,259 --> 01:02:56,826
Oh, God.

354
01:02:59,993 --> 01:03:02,058
Mmm. Oh, God.

355
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:06,025
Oh, baby, we missed you so much.

356
01:03:11,425 --> 01:03:13,392
Mmm...

357
01:03:13,526 --> 01:03:14,826
There you are.

358
01:03:14,959 --> 01:03:20,125
You were
such a beautiful baby.

359
01:03:29,626 --> 01:03:31,158
Get it out.

360
01:03:31,292 --> 01:03:33,692
Get it out. Come on.

361
01:03:33,826 --> 01:03:36,926
There you go.
There you go. There you go.

362
01:03:37,058 --> 01:03:39,225
- Sorry.
- Nothing to apologize for.

363
01:03:41,492 --> 01:03:43,259
Are you okay?

364
01:03:46,325 --> 01:03:49,859
The same fire
that destroyed our family...

365
01:03:51,659 --> 01:03:54,526
it burned up my insides.

366
01:03:59,092 --> 01:04:02,025
Mom and Dad used to have a...

367
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:07,826
kitchen, heh...

368
01:04:07,959 --> 01:04:09,959
in the basement of our house,

369
01:04:10,092 --> 01:04:12,993
where we used to cook.

370
01:04:16,926 --> 01:04:19,125
It was for our business.

371
01:04:23,425 --> 01:04:24,893
Are you thirsty?

372
01:04:39,526 --> 01:04:40,759
Tara?

373
01:04:42,626 --> 01:04:43,993
I'm dying.

374
01:04:44,125 --> 01:04:45,225
What?

375
01:04:46,726 --> 01:04:49,926
The smoke from the chemicals...

376
01:04:50,058 --> 01:04:53,726
poisoned my blood
and badly damaged my heart.

377
01:04:53,859 --> 01:04:56,692
I don't think
I have much time left.

378
01:04:56,826 --> 01:04:58,659
Is there anything you can do?

379
01:05:08,259 --> 01:05:11,726
I heard you left flowers for me
at our old house.

380
01:05:15,259 --> 01:05:16,492
Is that true?

381
01:05:19,492 --> 01:05:21,192
Oh.

382
01:05:22,759 --> 01:05:23,859
Weren't you wishing

383
01:05:23,993 --> 01:05:28,893
your mama
was healthy and alive?

384
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,259
Yes.

385
01:05:43,826 --> 01:05:45,692
I need a new heart, baby.

386
01:05:46,792 --> 01:05:48,993
But not just any heart.

387
01:05:49,125 --> 01:05:52,526
Doctor said
it has to be a, uh...

388
01:05:52,659 --> 01:05:54,592
It must be a...

389
01:05:56,158 --> 01:05:57,859
compatible donor.

390
01:06:02,092 --> 01:06:04,192
Like a direct relative.

391
01:06:06,826 --> 01:06:09,692
You hold the gift
that can save your mama's life.

392
01:06:13,993 --> 01:06:16,826
And, baby, I need that gift.

393
01:06:35,826 --> 01:06:38,893
We'll finally
be together as one.

394
01:06:40,826 --> 01:06:45,692
You'll live on in me.

395
01:07:14,626 --> 01:07:15,526
Go home.

396
01:09:08,926 --> 01:09:10,959
Go away.

397
01:09:11,092 --> 01:09:13,158
I said, go.

398
01:09:21,325 --> 01:09:22,392
Stay.

399
01:09:25,526 --> 01:09:26,826
Stay.

400
01:09:58,826 --> 01:10:00,259
Go home.

401
01:10:09,025 --> 01:10:10,359
Go home.

402
01:10:51,559 --> 01:10:52,692
I hope you understand

403
01:10:52,826 --> 01:10:55,025
the high risks
of this procedure.

404
01:10:56,492 --> 01:10:58,025
I think I pay you enough.

405
01:10:58,158 --> 01:11:00,058
Shut up and do your job.

406
01:11:01,526 --> 01:11:03,259
Why is she still alive?

407
01:11:04,692 --> 01:11:07,025
If she's dead, so is her heart.

408
01:11:08,492 --> 01:11:10,359
And I can't keep it fresh
long enough

409
01:11:10,492 --> 01:11:13,626
without the proper equipment.

410
01:11:13,759 --> 01:11:16,692
I have to cut it out of her
while she's still breathing.

411
01:11:18,792 --> 01:11:20,459
Hey.

412
01:11:20,592 --> 01:11:22,058
Hey, hey, hey.

413
01:11:22,192 --> 01:11:23,993
Hey, hey.

414
01:11:27,259 --> 01:11:28,659
<i>Thank you.</i>

415
01:11:49,058 --> 01:11:51,058
What's wrong with you, man?

416
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:54,559
What they're doing
in there is wrong.

417
01:11:56,392 --> 01:11:57,826
She's our cook.

418
01:11:59,292 --> 01:12:02,259
If she dies,
there's no product.

419
01:12:02,392 --> 01:12:04,726
If there's no product,
there's no us.

420
01:12:07,292 --> 01:12:08,392
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

421
01:12:10,692 --> 01:12:12,459
Still fucking wrong.

422
01:12:20,592 --> 01:12:21,626
Hey.

423
01:12:23,125 --> 01:12:25,392
- You ready?
- Mm-hm.

424
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:29,359
Let's go.

425
01:12:53,325 --> 01:12:54,526
What the fuck?

426
01:13:00,392 --> 01:13:02,025
Go check it out.

427
01:13:13,692 --> 01:13:14,792
Hm.

428
01:14:19,325 --> 01:14:21,192
You killed my brother!

429
01:14:22,659 --> 01:14:24,626
You blind freak!

430
01:14:46,959 --> 01:14:50,859
I'm gonna carve your fucking
head open like a pumpkin, man.

431
01:15:47,025 --> 01:15:49,125
This is for Shadow.

432
01:15:50,792 --> 01:15:52,192
Oh, fuck.

433
01:15:52,325 --> 01:15:53,559
No!

434
01:16:00,392 --> 01:16:01,826
It's him.

435
01:16:06,859 --> 01:16:09,325
How the hell did he find...?

436
01:16:28,025 --> 01:16:29,959
Disloyal fucking animal.

437
01:16:30,092 --> 01:16:31,993
Is everything okay?

438
01:16:33,692 --> 01:16:35,959
Yeah, everything's okay.

439
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:39,025
- Everything's okay, I promise.
- Baby, should I be worried?

440
01:16:39,158 --> 01:16:40,792
No, no. Not at all.

441
01:16:40,926 --> 01:16:42,292
I got you. I got you.

442
01:16:42,425 --> 01:16:44,959
I can't work without power.

443
01:16:45,092 --> 01:16:46,158
Uh...

444
01:16:47,125 --> 01:16:49,659
Change of plans, then.

445
01:16:49,792 --> 01:16:51,659
Pack your things.
Bring the girl.

446
01:16:51,792 --> 01:16:53,025
Raul.

447
01:16:54,692 --> 01:16:56,225
Bring the men.
Kill the blind man.

448
01:16:56,359 --> 01:17:00,025
- How many of us?
- All of you!

449
01:17:02,959 --> 01:17:04,058
Let's go.

450
01:18:37,125 --> 01:18:38,826
They're gonna kill her.

451
01:18:43,392 --> 01:18:45,025
And that's not cool with me.

452
01:18:48,826 --> 01:18:50,058
They're leaving now.

453
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:51,359
The ladder behind you

454
01:18:51,492 --> 01:18:53,025
leads directly to them.

455
01:18:53,158 --> 01:18:54,759
You'd better hurry.

456
01:19:08,759 --> 01:19:10,225
Go left.

457
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,626
That way.

458
01:19:15,993 --> 01:19:17,526
He'll kill you all.

459
01:19:27,259 --> 01:19:28,225
Fuck it. I'm out.

460
01:19:28,359 --> 01:19:30,626
Hey, hey! Hey!

461
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:57,792
Good morning, motherfucker.

462
01:20:02,125 --> 01:20:04,859
- Baby.
- Shh, shh. It's okay.

463
01:20:04,993 --> 01:20:07,158
Stop it.

464
01:20:39,859 --> 01:20:41,092
Baby?

465
01:20:42,659 --> 01:20:43,726
Hello?

466
01:20:43,859 --> 01:20:45,492
I can't see you.

467
01:20:54,893 --> 01:20:56,158
Baby?

468
01:21:28,792 --> 01:21:30,826
I'm over here! Where are you?

469
01:21:32,125 --> 01:21:33,459
Baby?

470
01:21:57,192 --> 01:21:59,192
I got you, motherfucker.

471
01:22:10,559 --> 01:22:11,859
No.

472
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:15,325
No! No!

473
01:22:23,392 --> 01:22:24,259
No.

474
01:22:25,959 --> 01:22:27,759
No!

475
01:23:19,993 --> 01:23:21,158
Phoenix!

476
01:23:54,526 --> 01:23:56,292
Now...

477
01:23:56,425 --> 01:23:58,325
you're gonna see

478
01:23:58,459 --> 01:24:00,325
what I see.

479
01:24:50,392 --> 01:24:51,893
Phoenix?

480
01:25:02,459 --> 01:25:04,092
Stop.

481
01:25:04,225 --> 01:25:05,859
Oh, stop!

482
01:25:08,959 --> 01:25:10,325
You...

483
01:25:12,659 --> 01:25:14,859
You mustn't come near me.

484
01:25:20,959 --> 01:25:24,893
Everything he said...

485
01:25:27,826 --> 01:25:29,225
is true.

486
01:25:35,926 --> 01:25:38,225
I am no father.

487
01:25:42,993 --> 01:25:45,292
I have killed.

488
01:25:50,926 --> 01:25:52,025
I...

489
01:25:53,025 --> 01:25:54,626
have raped.

490
01:25:55,759 --> 01:25:56,959
I...

491
01:26:00,325 --> 01:26:01,826
am nothing.

492
01:26:07,526 --> 01:26:08,792
Nothing...

493
01:26:10,826 --> 01:26:12,492
but a monster.

494
01:26:18,659 --> 01:26:20,325
And you...

495
01:26:20,459 --> 01:26:22,526
cannot be around me.

496
01:26:24,359 --> 01:26:25,359
Ever.

497
01:26:27,659 --> 01:26:28,559
So go.

498
01:26:32,158 --> 01:26:33,559
Now. Go.

499
01:26:34,893 --> 01:26:36,092
Go!

500
01:27:08,025 --> 01:27:10,158
Oh, God.

501
01:27:59,859 --> 01:28:00,826
Tara?

502
01:28:24,959 --> 01:28:26,659
No.

503
01:28:28,492 --> 01:28:31,092
No. No.

504
01:28:35,526 --> 01:28:36,425
Please.

505
01:28:41,792 --> 01:28:43,526
No, no, no.

506
01:28:45,225 --> 01:28:46,592
Let me help you.

507
01:28:48,459 --> 01:28:50,025
I can save you.

508
01:28:55,792 --> 01:28:57,726
You already have.

509
01:30:42,726 --> 01:30:44,158
Hey.

510
01:30:45,859 --> 01:30:46,893
Hey.

511
01:30:48,292 --> 01:30:50,158
Think there's room for one more?

512
01:30:51,726 --> 01:30:52,759
I'm sure there is.

513
01:30:54,859 --> 01:30:56,225
What's your name?

514
01:31:00,659 --> 01:31:02,325
My name is Phoenix.

515
