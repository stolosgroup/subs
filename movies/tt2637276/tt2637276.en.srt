We got to find a sperm donor.

You want Flash Gordon
to father your child?

Yeah. You think...
Would that be weird?

No, I think he'd be flattered!

will be a fucking superhero!

Yeah, I say do it!
All right. Great.

308

and see if I can stop by.

- Yes!

we get the gun.

Well, I've gone through
your application...

and vetted
your personal histories,

this isn't gonna work out.

What?
Why not?

605
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:05,877
First of all, there's the question
of Tami-Lynn's drug conviction.

Hey, I did my community service.

Yeah, besides, that was five years ago.

There's another issue...

609
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:15,519
and, honestly,
it's the more serious one.

610
00:35:15,521 --> 00:35:18,288
I was reluctant
to bring it up because...

611
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:21,357
it's a little awkward.

612
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,460
Ted, in the eyes of the state,
you are not a person.

613

Wait, what?

614
00:35:29,298 --> 00:35:35,034
The state official I spoke to said that technically,
you are classified as property.

615
00:35:37,003 --> 00:35:39,504
I'm not a person?

616
00:35:39,506 --> 00:35:42,773
Not according to the government.
I'm sorry.

617

But that is so fucked up!

What do you mean,
be careful?

625

The state official
I spoke to...

626
00:36:00,422 --> 00:36:04,490
made it sound like your status
had gone under the radar for some time.

627

Your adoption request
may have raised some red flags.

If they choose
to investigate the issue,

629
00:36:10,263 --> 00:36:13,163
it may leave you
quite vulnerable.

Hey. I just got off work
and heard your message.

631

Did they actually tell you that?

632
00:36:30,513 --> 00:36:34,281
Yeah, it's unbelievable.
Property... They said I'm property.

633
00:36:34,283 --> 00:36:36,349
What does that even mean?
Like, you're a thing?

What, like garbage
or a piece of shit?

Well, I mean, maybe more like a hammer
or an orange, but yeah.

What the hell do they know?
It's just a word.

637
00:36:44,858 --> 00:36:47,058
They can't change your whole life just
by calling you property.

638

Bullshit!
You better ask my ancestors.

I can't legally keep you on
as an employee...

a little boy named John Bennett...

895
00:49:20,532 --> 00:49:23,432
made a wish that his teddy bear
would come to life.

896
00:49:23,434 --> 00:49:25,867
Somehow,
one of our Hasbro bears...

897
00:49:25,869 --> 00:49:28,229
Yes, I'm aware of the story.

898
00:49:29,504 --> 00:49:31,004
Have you seen this?

899
00:49:33,207 --> 00:49:35,675
[ Sighs ]

900
00:49:35,677 --> 00:49:37,510
So what?

901
00:49:37,512 --> 00:49:41,146
Well, Ted is suing
for his civil rights.

902
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:44,749
If he loses, the state
will officially declare him a non-entity...

903
00:49:44,751 --> 00:49:46,517
with no rights under the law.

904
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:49,119
That means he becomes property.

905
00:49:49,121 --> 00:49:52,122
Mr. Jessup,

906
00:49:52,124 --> 00:49:56,092
we could take him back, with only
a trivial degree of legal consequence...

907
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:57,827
if we were even caught.

908
00:49:57,829 --> 00:49:59,695
And why would we do this?

909
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:04,866
Sir, if we could cut him open
to see what makes him tick,

910
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:08,970
we could manufacture millions of
Teds for every child in the world.

911
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:11,238
Hasbro would double
its profits overnight.

912
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,740
Go on.

913
00:50:13,742 --> 00:50:16,676
We-We just have to make sure
Ted loses the case.

914
00:50:16,678 --> 00:50:19,879
You use every back channel,
every bribe,

915
00:50:19,881 --> 00:50:21,647
you call in every favor...

916
00:50:21,649 --> 00:50:25,984
and you get the best lawyer
in the world on the defense.

917
00:50:25,986 --> 00:50:29,019
When Ted's rights
are officially null,

918
00:50:30,688 --> 00:50:32,088
we grab him.

919
00:50:33,657 --> 00:50:37,693
No one's going to kick up
a legal fuss over property.

920
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:40,529
You're a hell of a lot smarter
than your urinal cakes, Danny.

921

[ Whispers ]
Really?

922
00:50:42,065 --> 00:50:44,799
Now, what exactly
do you want from this?

923
00:50:44,801 --> 00:50:47,835
Mr. Jessup,
I'm not interested in money.

924
00:50:50,572 --> 00:50:52,940
I just want a Ted
for my very own.

925
00:50:54,175 --> 00:50:57,977
All right. I think I can handle
the defense.

926
00:50:57,979 --> 00:50:59,645
But let's make one thing clear.

927
00:50:59,647 --> 00:51:01,847
We never had this conversation.

928
00:51:01,849 --> 00:51:05,750
Goldner and the board cannot
know about this until we have him.

929
00:51:05,752 --> 00:51:08,586
Do you understand?
Yes, I do.

930

That was such a good dinner,

I've never had Pringles on my steak before.
It's my pleasure.

It's the least I can do
with all you're doing for us. Really.

935
00:51:26,303 --> 00:51:28,636
Well, I haven't
done anything yet.

936

We wanted to take you
out to dinner,

937

but all we got is Tami's income these days
since nobody will hire me.

938

Things are getting
really tight, huh?

939
00:51:35,944 --> 00:51:38,644

Hey, listen,
I got an idea.

you and me go do the dishes...

that was about?

Oh, it's nothing. That's his way of saying
I should ask you out.

Ah.
Yeah, look.

952
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:10,037
We should probably focus
our attention on the case for now.

953
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:12,606
I completely agree.

954
00:52:12,608 --> 00:52:14,908
You know,
I am a little bit curious.

955
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:18,211
How is it that a guy like you
is unattached?

956
00:52:18,213 --> 00:52:22,582
Well, I-I was married at one point,
but it just didn't work out.

Shit. I'm sorry.
That sucks.

958
00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:28,120
No. I mean, we'd make it work
day to day,

959
00:52:28,122 --> 00:52:31,756
but she was always just trying
to change me into someone I'm not.

And I tried, you know?

961
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:38,928
I really tried everything I could to be
the man that she wanted.

962
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:43,098
One day I woke up, and I just
realized I wasn't myself anymore.

You know? As much as I love this person,
we're completely wrong for each other.

At least
you figured it out early.

Thank you, Your Honor.

to be a part
of these proceedings.

1002
00:55:04,717 --> 00:55:09,819
Now, the case we'll be examining today
is really quite a simple one.

1003
00:55:09,821 --> 00:55:12,354
Is Ted a human being...

1004
00:55:12,356 --> 00:55:14,289
or a piece of property?

1005
00:55:15,391 --> 00:55:18,259
You know, it really is
a very special,

1006
00:55:18,261 --> 00:55:22,062
very... unique thing
to be human.

1007
00:55:22,064 --> 00:55:28,000
It's a gift from God bestowed
upon only one species... Us.

1008
00:55:28,002 --> 00:55:31,770
But if we suddenly decide
to share that gift,

1009
00:55:31,772 --> 00:55:33,838
where does that lead us?

doesn't seem so special anymore, does it?

the right decision.

Why am I nervous?
Um...

Not because I'm a junior attorney
arguing her first case.

1021

And not because some of you might laugh at

"Justice."

1025

you're going to be swayed...

1026
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,995
by smooth talk and a haircut,

1027
00:56:41,997 --> 00:56:46,064
and forget about the most
important aspect of this case.

1028
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:48,799
Justice.

1029
00:56:50,201 --> 00:56:54,204
150 years ago,
a slave by the name of Dred Scott...

1030
00:56:54,206 --> 00:56:57,307
sued to prove that he was a
person and not a piece of property.

1031
00:56:57,975 --> 00:56:59,542
He lost.

1032
00:56:59,544 --> 00:57:03,879
And as history has shown us,
that wasn't justice.

1033
00:57:05,982 --> 00:57:09,384
In every civil rights conflict,

1034
00:57:09,386 --> 00:57:15,589
we are only able to recognize the just
point of view years after the fact.

1035
00:57:15,591 --> 00:57:18,124
And when the next conflict
comes along,

1036
00:57:18,126 --> 00:57:22,261
we're once again
blind to it as it's happening.

"Well, this is different,"
we say. But it isn't.

just wearing a different face...

So I urge you,

1041
00:57:36,909 --> 00:57:40,269
not to be a footnote
on the wrong side of history.
