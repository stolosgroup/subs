00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,243

00:35:06,444 --> 00:35:08,213
- Hey, Joe.
- [ Thunder rumbles ]

496
00:35:08,248 --> 00:35:10,380
I told you.

Ha!

You just be glad you ain't
no snake-oil drummer.

Phew!

503
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,434
So you really don't like 'em,
do you?

504
00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:06,601
Salesmen? Hell no.
Huh!

505
00:36:06,636 --> 00:36:08,570
Forking tongue.

506
00:36:08,605 --> 00:36:11,441
Slippery little shits.
The lot of 'em.

507
00:36:11,476 --> 00:36:14,510
- You can't trust them.
- Why not?

508
00:36:14,545 --> 00:36:16,908
Well, you can't trust
a salesman ever.

509
00:36:16,943 --> 00:36:19,317
'Cause if you ain't buying
what he's selling,

00:36:19,352 --> 00:36:21,946
why, he ain't eating.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

511
00:36:21,981 --> 00:36:25,257
They don't give a damn
about you or what you need.

They're just trying
to make their monthly. Yeah.

513
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,294
Trust me, I know about this,
yeah.

514
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:32,396
See, I had
the unfortunate experience

515
00:36:32,431 --> 00:36:36,433
of dabbling in sales myself
when I was a younger man.

516
00:36:36,468 --> 00:36:37,764
Oh. Really?

517
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:39,865
Oh, yes.

518
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,373
Well, what happened?

519
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,770
What do you mean?

520
00:36:43,805 --> 00:36:46,410
Well, I mean, to not make you
like salesmen

521
00:36:46,445 --> 00:36:47,807
or being a salesman.

522
00:36:47,842 --> 00:36:49,776
Well, all I know
is that when I was younger,

523
00:36:49,811 --> 00:36:52,713
I took a job as a salesman

524
00:36:52,748 --> 00:36:55,782
just to try to make
some extra money.

525
00:36:55,817 --> 00:36:59,819
See, back in those days,
it was tough to make ends meet,

526
00:36:59,854 --> 00:37:03,823
and it wasn't uncommon for
fellas to hold down a few jobs.

527
00:37:03,858 --> 00:37:06,331
And, well, in the beginning,
you know,

528
00:37:06,366 --> 00:37:08,399
it wasn't too bad.

529
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,962
And I don't give a 2-cent shit
about what I was selling.

530
00:37:10,997 --> 00:37:14,537
I just wanted the do-re-mi,
huh? Yeah.

531
00:37:14,572 --> 00:37:15,769
But...

532
00:37:17,608 --> 00:37:20,609
...after a while,

533
00:37:20,644 --> 00:37:22,842
it started to grate on me
a little, you know,

534
00:37:22,877 --> 00:37:25,977
and, well, I quit
'cause I just got...

535
00:37:26,012 --> 00:37:28,749
I got sick and tired
of deceiving people. Mm-hmm.

536

of deceiving myself,

if you know what I mean.

538
00:37:33,822 --> 00:37:36,526
I just got sick and tired
of feeling like every day

539
00:37:36,561 --> 00:37:38,858
was just a waking nightmare,
going door to door,

540
00:37:38,893 --> 00:37:41,663
selling people shit
that they did not need

541
00:37:41,698 --> 00:37:45,370
and that they could not afford
just so that I could make my nut

542
00:37:45,405 --> 00:37:48,065
and pay the bills
and keep the wife happy

543
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,969
so she wouldn't bust my ass
about not being able to buy

the new goddamn toaster oven.

really hear this now.

- Um, you mentioned your wife.
- Mm.

ain't worth the fucking
you receive.

That's enough about her, huh?
Yeah.

00:38:22,442 --> 00:38:25,872
I could tell you a funny story
about a salesman if...

Um, sure.

00:38:30,945 --> 00:38:32,681
Okay.

00:38:34,113 --> 00:38:36,080
Once upon a time [Laughs]

561
00:38:36,115 --> 00:38:38,621
"Once upon a time."
One time a long time ago,

562
00:38:38,656 --> 00:38:40,557
a fella come here.
He was a Bible salesman.

563
00:38:40,592 --> 00:38:43,593
Goddamn Bible salesman.
Can you believe that shit?

564
00:38:45,025 --> 00:38:48,092
I mean, what's a fella doing
hawking the Good Book out here

565
00:38:48,127 --> 00:38:50,094
in the middle
of the Smoky Mountains?

566
00:38:50,129 --> 00:38:52,866
I mean, to who?
[ Laughs ]

567
00:38:52,901 --> 00:38:55,165
Well, this fella's name was...

568
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,443
was, um... His name was...

569
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:02,106
Mm! Can't ever remember his name
for some reason,

570
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:05,043
but it don't really matter.

571
00:39:05,078 --> 00:39:09,850
But, yeah, oh, boy, I sure do
remember his stupid, fat face.

572
00:39:10,952 --> 00:39:13,117
I remember his shit-brown tie.

573
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:16,054
I remember
his leather briefcase.

574
00:39:16,089 --> 00:39:18,023
And I remember I answered
the door,

575
00:39:18,058 --> 00:39:21,433
and he sticks his arms
out wide kind of like this.

576
00:39:21,468 --> 00:39:23,765
And he says...

577
00:39:24,636 --> 00:39:27,098
SALESMAN: Greetings
and salutations, brother!

578

What a glorious day it is,
indeed.

579
00:39:29,938 --> 00:39:33,511
Tell me something, sir,
and, please,

580
00:39:33,546 --> 00:39:35,843
I implore you
to be honest with me...

581
00:39:35,878 --> 00:39:38,879
"Have you accepted
the Lord Jesus Christ

583
00:39:42,621 --> 00:39:45,050
I'd like to invite you
to join me today

584
00:39:45,085 --> 00:39:49,087
- in his warm embrace.
- "In his warm embrace."

585
00:39:52,158 --> 00:39:55,665
That's what he said. That's the
first words out of his mouth.

586
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,029
Then what?

587
00:39:57,064 --> 00:40:00,131
Well, then I gave him
a warm embrace.

588
00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:02,672
Oh.

589
00:40:02,707 --> 00:40:05,609
Something tells me you didn't
buy a Bible, though, did you?

590
00:40:05,644 --> 00:40:08,513
No, I did not, no.

591
00:40:08,548 --> 00:40:10,141
What'd you do to him?

592
00:40:10,176 --> 00:40:14,112
I invited him in,
just much like you, actually.

593
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:17,984
Oh? You threw a shotgun
in his face?

594
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:20,019
Oh, hell no.
I didn't have to do that.

595
00:40:20,054 --> 00:40:23,660
No, I offered him some coffee
and some cake.

596
00:40:23,695 --> 00:40:25,629
You have cake?

597
00:40:25,664 --> 00:40:27,697
Joe...

598
00:40:27,732 --> 00:40:31,965
this is where the story
gets real good.

599
00:40:33,606 --> 00:40:36,200
Yeah. Hee hee.

600
00:40:36,235 --> 00:40:38,873
So I invited him in.

601
00:40:38,908 --> 00:40:42,910
I asked him to have a seat.
Right there.

602
00:40:42,945 --> 00:40:46,683
Exactly where you're sitting
as a matter of fact.

603
00:40:46,718 --> 00:40:48,685
I went into the kitchen.

604
00:40:50,821 --> 00:40:53,921
Poured him a cup of coffee.

605
00:40:55,188 --> 00:40:58,563
Brought him out a nice hunk
of carrot cake.

606
00:40:58,598 --> 00:41:01,995
Yeah. See,
that was really for Rascal,

607
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:04,569
'cause that's his favorite,
but, well...

608
00:41:04,604 --> 00:41:07,099
I gave it
to the fat man instead.

609
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:08,771
And then...

610
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:14,172
...I took a seat.
Mm-hmm.

611
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:18,847
Right across from him.

612
00:41:22,985 --> 00:41:24,182
Ain't it good?

613
00:41:24,217 --> 00:41:27,119
Mmm. Very.

614
00:41:29,189 --> 00:41:31,255
Now...

615
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:35,325
he was a very pious man,

616
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,964
this fella. Mm-hmm.

617
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:39,571
Real self-righteous type, too.

618
00:41:39,606 --> 00:41:43,938
You know, a kind of fella who...

619
00:41:43,973 --> 00:41:47,645
who follows all them rules
they got.

620
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,683
Thou shalt not take
the Lord's name in vain!

621
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:55,279
Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's wife!

622
00:41:55,314 --> 00:41:58,920
Thou shalt not kill!

623
00:41:58,955 --> 00:42:02,088
Blah! Blah!

624
00:42:02,123 --> 00:42:05,729
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!

625
00:42:05,764 --> 00:42:07,192
[ Laughs ] Yeah.

626
00:42:07,227 --> 00:42:13,000
Anyway, he was
a strong believer in all that.

627
00:42:13,035 --> 00:42:14,804
Yeah.

628
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:16,938
At least...

629
00:42:17,644 --> 00:42:20,073
...that's how he presented
himself to be.

630
00:42:20,108 --> 00:42:23,813
I mean, he was also a salesman.

631
00:42:23,848 --> 00:42:25,782
You follow?

632
00:42:25,817 --> 00:42:31,216
So it was hard to tell whether
or not he was being genuine now.

633
00:42:35,959 --> 00:42:39,125
I couldn't tell you why then,
and I cannot tell you why now.

634
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,864
But for some reason,
on that day...

635
00:42:41,899 --> 00:42:44,394
[Blows]

636
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:49,300
...I-I felt like
I had to find out

637
00:42:49,335 --> 00:42:52,743
whether or not he was
a true believer.

638
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:57,341
Or was he just
completely full of shit?

639
00:42:58,146 --> 00:43:00,652
How did you do that?

640
00:43:00,687 --> 00:43:02,984
I asked him a few questions.

641
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:05,019
What'd you ask him?

642
00:43:07,287 --> 00:43:10,156
I started like...

643
00:43:11,126 --> 00:43:13,896
I said, "Sir...

644
00:43:13,931 --> 00:43:16,833
do you really believe
that God loves you?"

645
00:43:16,868 --> 00:43:17,900
And he said...

646
00:43:17,935 --> 00:43:20,364
Brother, I know God loves me.

647
00:43:23,204 --> 00:43:26,337
Okay.
I said, "Well,

648
00:43:26,372 --> 00:43:31,716
if God loves you so much,
how come he got you

649
00:43:31,751 --> 00:43:35,852
selling Bibles out here
in the middle of fucking nowhere

650
00:43:35,887 --> 00:43:38,756
instead of living in a mansion

Ooh, they make a man do all sort
of stupid through his lifetime.

of insanity. Yeah.

well, what happened with you

1138
01:07:44,169 --> 01:07:48,501
You know, I mean,
well, why did it end?

It ended 'cause
she finally figured it out.

[ Chuckles ] Hey, Joe, I know
I asked you this already,

Not really.

1148
01:08:31,216 --> 01:08:33,414

1149
01:08:34,747 --> 01:08:37,418
Mm... beginning?

1150
01:08:37,453 --> 01:08:40,487
Well, yeah,
that's what I would do.

1151
01:08:42,557 --> 01:08:46,295
Well, I came
by way of Knoxville,

1152
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:48,924
and I drove into Elkmont

1153
01:08:48,959 --> 01:08:52,400
because I wanted to take a hike
along the Little River.

1154
01:08:52,435 --> 01:08:55,733
I told you I used to fly-fish it
when I was a boy.

It's always been
one of my favorite places.

1156
01:08:59,409 --> 01:09:02,674
I mean, the truth is, I hadn't
been in these woods in decades.

1157
01:09:02,709 --> 01:09:06,546
How come
you come out here today?

1158
01:09:06,581 --> 01:09:09,384
Well, like I said, I've been...

1159
01:09:09,419 --> 01:09:11,254
dealing with some issues lately,

1160
01:09:11,289 --> 01:09:13,916
so I guess I thought
that coming back to a place

1161
01:09:13,951 --> 01:09:15,588
that I had fond memories of,

1162
01:09:15,623 --> 01:09:16,952
of where I'd been happy
at one point,

1163
01:09:16,987 --> 01:09:20,725
is where I needed
to be to get my mind right.

1164
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:24,597
So I got off work and drove
an hour south to Elkmont,

1165
01:09:24,632 --> 01:09:26,896
and I took the trail,
and I started walking.

1166
01:09:26,931 --> 01:09:28,898
Oh, but then I...

1167
01:09:31,309 --> 01:09:32,902
What?

1168
01:09:37,942 --> 01:09:43,484
Well, when I got
to Burnt Mountain, I...

1169
01:09:43,519 --> 01:09:45,717
I heard something.

1170
01:09:46,588 --> 01:09:48,819
What did you hear?

1171
01:09:49,558 --> 01:09:51,294
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

1172
01:09:51,329 --> 01:09:52,625
What did you hear?

1173
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:57,993
Well, it was... It was...

1174
01:09:58,028 --> 01:10:01,997
- Well, it was like a moan.
- A moan.

1175
01:10:04,969 --> 01:10:08,377
Yes. Like deep breaths

1176
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:10,874
I could feel building
inside my head.

1177
01:10:10,909 --> 01:10:14,977
Only... Only they were coming
from somewhere else.

1178
01:10:15,012 --> 01:10:17,848
So I started walking
towards them,

1179
01:10:17,883 --> 01:10:20,851
and, well, then that took me
off the trail I was on.

1180
01:10:20,886 --> 01:10:23,491
And as I got deeper
and deeper into the woods,

1181
01:10:23,526 --> 01:10:25,625
this moan just got
louder and louder.

1182
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:27,825
So I ran.

1183
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:32,302
I ran as fast and as far
as I could until...

...black.

I must have passed out
or something

1188
01:10:44,415 --> 01:10:46,778
because when I came to,
it was too late.

1189

I mean, I got all turned around.

1190

I didn't know where I was,
and I couldn't find my way back.

1191
01:10:52,984 --> 01:10:55,391
So I started walking again.

[<i> Footsteps</i> ]

Well...

...a long, long time ago,

1215
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:18,133
the Cherokee people,
the Indians,

1216
01:12:18,168 --> 01:12:21,642
they lived in these lands,

1217
01:12:21,677 --> 01:12:27,076
and they had a story
about the purple lake.

1218
01:12:27,111 --> 01:12:28,715
The purple lake?

1219
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:34,050
This lake was hidden
deep in the Smokies.

1220
01:12:34,888 --> 01:12:38,791
And they looked for it,
but they could never find it.

1221
01:12:38,826 --> 01:12:40,122
But they wanted to find it

1222
01:12:40,157 --> 01:12:43,697
'cause they said
that it had special powers.

1223
01:12:43,732 --> 01:12:47,701
And the only ones
who knew how to find the lake

1224
01:12:47,736 --> 01:12:50,000
were the animals.

1225
01:12:50,035 --> 01:12:52,838
And the animals
knew how to find the lake,

1226
01:12:52,873 --> 01:12:54,642
but they weren't telling nobody

1227
01:12:54,677 --> 01:12:56,743
because they wanted to keep it
a secret,

1228
01:12:56,778 --> 01:13:00,846
because I guess
if they got ever hurt

1229
01:13:00,881 --> 01:13:05,114
or injured or sick,

1230
01:13:05,149 --> 01:13:08,557
all they had to do was drink the
water, and they would be healed.

Well, then I found it...

but more something
you can't see.

1237
01:13:34,552 --> 01:13:37,949
I was damaged, I guess.

1238
01:13:37,984 --> 01:13:43,691
So, anyway, I thought I would
come out to these mountains

1239

[<i> Boy laughs</i> ]

And if I could find that lake

then I would be healed, too.
