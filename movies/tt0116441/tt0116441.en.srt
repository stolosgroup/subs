2
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,600
Makes you think.

3
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:21,188
Makes you think about
the people in your life.

4
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:24,942
I think of Neil and if he were sittin'
here right now, what he'd say to me.

5
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,568
He'd say,
"John, what's it about?

6
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,781
What's life about...

7
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,328
if you don't go through it
as a man's man."

8
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,789
He'd say, "Suck it up.
Take the fall. Do the time.

9
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,667
That's what made you who you are.
That makes you what you are."

10
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,923
How long we been around this thing
of ours, this Cosa Nostra?

11
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:50,175
120 years.
And what's it about?

12
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,219
It's about the rules, parameters.

13
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:55,472
You take the beatin' for the friend.
You don't run, you don't lay down.

14
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:58,892
You don't betray who you are,
what you are.

15
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,644
- Self-esteem, John.
- Self-esteem. It's basic.

16
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,355
You pick it up on the street.
You gotta remember Angie here.

17
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,774
I loved this guy.
I loved him.

18
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,651
He was stupid.
He never listened to me.

19
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:10,070
He always wanted
the goddamn dope money.

20
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,573
He never rolled.
You know that?

21
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,410
He never rolled.

22
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:18,412
My brother Gene, Joey D'Mig,
they don't roll.

23
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,789
They're doin' a thousand years.
They don't roll. They don't rat.

24
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,876
Why? That's the rule.
You don't break. You don't rat.

25
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,588
Basic rules.
Gives you a little power, right?

26
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,966
Not the kinda power these Feds have.

27
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,594
God forbid we pull their chain
in public, right?

28
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:37,931
Fuckin' dress better than them, they
take it personal, like it's a vendetta.

29
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:40,184
They're supposed to act better
than the rest of us.

30
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:47,107
They just want me to be somethin'
I wasn't even born to be.

31
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:49,234
Humble.
They want you to be humble.

32
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:52,487
So you humble me.
What you got now?

33
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,198
You got a war?

34
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:58,202
You got a global war?

35
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:02,789
You got the Chinks, Dominicans,
Asians, Russians, Columbians, Jamaicans.

36
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:05,709
What are they doin'?
They desecrate the nation.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,378
You got your veritable fuckin'
snowstorms of cocaine and smack...

38
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:10,172
whatever the hell else
they shove in their veins.

39
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:13,300
You got a worldwide crime syndicate now.
There's no rules.

40
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:17,262
There's no parameters.
There's no feelings.

41
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:19,348
There's no feelings
for this country.

42
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,934
- Anarchy.
- You got anarchy.

43
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:27,564
So?

44
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,399
Five, ten years from now...

45
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,820
there gonna wish there was
American Cosa Nostra.

46
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,783
Five or ten years from now...

47
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,371
they're gonna miss John Gotti.

48
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:29,329
Ang, remember the time we were in Vegas,
we seen that funny guy, Joey Villa?

49
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,830
At the Riviera.

50
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,291
Who was the guy who walked
in the bar that night, Jo-Jo?

51
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:36,378
That short guy.
This is a funny story. Listen.

52
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:40,299
Jo-Jo comes into the bar wearin'
a solid gold buckle this big.

53
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,008
It says Jo-Jo on it.

54
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,760
He's got a bracelet on his arm
says Jo-Jo on it.

55
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,555
Got a fuckin' necklace says Jo-Jo on it.
He's got solid gold cuff links.

56
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:49,141
They all say Jo-Jo on 'em.

57
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,018
Little Chink bellhop walks in,
he says...

58
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,561
"Excuse me, Mr. Jo-Jo."

59
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,938
He says, "Shut the fuck up.
I don't want nobody to know I'm here."

60
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,858
True story.
I was there.

61
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,070
All right.

62
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,615
Do what you want with yours.
I'm gettin' down on the Knicks.

63
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:09,328
John, who owns a bigger piece of you,
your bookie or your tailor?

64
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,829
I'm split right down the middle, baby.

65
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:14,458
Put out the fuckin' cigarette
before you give us all cancer, please.

66
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:18,629
What cancer? The government
has not proved cigarettes cause cancer.

67
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,172
What fuckin' government
is he talkin' about now?

68
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,508
You know the tobacco people
own the Feds.

69
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,260
- Fuck them.
- Put out the fuckin' cigarette.

70
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,471
- Are you serious?
- Yeah!

71
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,097
What a fuckin' ball breaker here.

72
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,809
Gene, you goin' to Mom's later?

73
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,645
It's Friday night.
Me and Pete are both goin'.

74
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,105
Give it up.
Put your share on top of it.

75
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,733
Kick somethin' into that
like you're supposed to.

76
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,860
No, right now.
D'Mig, kick in.

77
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,738
You been robbin' cannolis from us
for 20 fuckin' years now.

78
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:49,826
John, your old man told me
your mother's got a Zulu maid.

79
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,911
Fuckin' guy.

80
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:52,955
He never wanted me to marry Vicki.

81
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:55,415
Best thing that ever
happened to me in my life.

82
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,334
- Never wanted me to marry her.
- Why not?

83
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:00,212
Vicki's stepfather's Italian,
but her real father was a Jew.

84
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,130
- So?
- The Jews whacked out Jesus.

85
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:06,176
- Get the fuck outta here!
- Maybe he had it comin'.

86
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,011
Under the table.
Watch out for that bolt of lightning.

87
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:10,264
Cover your head, Angie.

88
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,643
That's funny.

89
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:17,229
John, it's Neil.

90
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,231
- Hey, Neil.
- Mr. Neil.

91
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,068
How are ya? All right?

92
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:30,742
- What is it?
- Don Carlo wants to see you.

93
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,037
He wants to see me?

94
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:39,459
- Right now?
- Right now.

95
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,506
Angie goes with?

96
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,180
Bring him along.

97
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:01,190
Who woulda thought the King
of the Volcano lived in this place?

98
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,193
It's the old-timer's style.
He don't flash nothin'.

99
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:09,448
- Hey, you stink.
- Angie can't come?

100
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,492
Don Carlo sent for you, not Angie.

101
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:15,704
Let him talk.
Don't interrupt.

102
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:20,417
He's old, but he's still sharp.
And don't dare underestimate him.

103
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,715
- Hey, Neil, how you doin'?
- Hello. Sammy Gravano.

104
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:29,885
- You know John Gotti?
- Just by reputation.

105
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:32,554
- Same here. How you doin'?
- You're smilin'.

106
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,805
- You must've heard good things.
- Nothin' but.

107
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:36,183
- Come by my club. We'll go bouncin.
- Sounds good.

108
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,060
They're expectin' you fellas.

109
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,645
Thanks, Sammy.

110
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,820
Don Carlo, this is John Gotti.

111
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,241
How are ya?

112
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,784
Paul Castellano.

113
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,120
How you doin', Paul?

114
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,705
- Joe Armone.
- How are you?

115
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,749
Well, sit down.

116
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:05,379
I heard good things.

117
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:08,423
You built Carmine's
Brownsville book up...

118
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,383
a hundred thousand a month.

119
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,303
A hundred thousand.

120
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,138
Never took a dime from the top.

121
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,229
You're a young man
not tempted by foolish money.

122
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:30,571
You seem to respect my, uh...

123
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,864
my policy on drugs.

124
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:39,246
You know, the Feds...

125
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:43,625
they tolerate certain things.

126
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,878
Certain things.

127
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,296
Not drugs.

128
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:54,469
You make your crew understand.
They deal in drugs, that's all.

129
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,345
They die!

130
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,472
I've done that.

131
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:05,105
I tell you this 'cause
I see a future for you.

132
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:08,734
But first there's something else.

133
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:13,906
My-My nephew.

134
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,160
He's a saint.

135
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,662
Not of our life, no.

136
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:28,420
Westies. Scum!

137
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,671
Irish scum.

138
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:34,384
They blew his face away
and they put him back in the car.

139
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:43,352
The man responsible has been found.
Lives in Staten Island.

140
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,946
I want you to do this for me.

141
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:55,239
It's done.

142
00:10:56,532 --> 00:11:00,744
From this moment,
you're under my flag.

143
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:09,169
I want you to take
one of my men with you...

144
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,754
Ralph Galione.

145
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:14,466
I'll fill Neil in with the details.

146
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,929
It went well.

147
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:22,266
This hit is a walk in the sun.

148
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:24,768
The old man...

149
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,103
will never forget it.

150
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,729
Yeah.

151
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:31,567
Who's this Galione?

152
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,610
He's in Castellano's crew.

153
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:39,074
Between him and Sammy Gravano,
they whacked a dozen bums.

154
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:45,664
Why didn't they give me Sammy?
I know nothin' about this Galione.

155
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:50,586
You're the underboss here.
Castellano should defer to you a little.

156
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,922
If he wants one of his guys along,
I got no beef.

157
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:59,303
- Just tell him to give me Sammy.
- Paul wants Galione on this.

158
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,055
Leave it at that.

159
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,641
Is that what you want?

160
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:07,311
It doesn't matter
what the fuck I want.

161
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,396
That's the way it is.

162
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:12,065
Just let it go.

163
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,067
Just go with it.
Go with the tide.

164
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,070
All right.
Forget I said it.

165
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:21,408
Galione. Hop in.

166
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,675
Galione, you always snort on a hit?

167
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:42,763
- Sharpens my concentration.
- Good. Start concentratin'.

168
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:44,473
We're goin' out to a joint
in Staten Island.

169
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:47,184
No one's gonna pay attention
to us now if we're cool.

170
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:49,686
McBratney's there every night.
He sits at the end of the bar.

171
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:52,314
I'm gonna mention some names
from the West Side.

172
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,858
He's gonna figure I'm gonna try to
sell him some stuff. Stay near the door.

173
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:59,655
We're gonna take him out to the car,
whack him in the parking lot. Capisce?

174
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:12,376
Where you goin'? He sees
a third guy, he's gonna smell a rat.

175
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,628
- I said the door.
- All right. Take it easy.

176
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,637
- What'll it be?
- You got any Boudels?

177
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:26,557
- Yeah, we got it.
- What are you drinkin', Ang?

178
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:29,643
- Dewars.
- Dewars and the Boudels.

179
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:32,437
Who's that, Jimmy?
McBratney, right?

180
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,648
- Who wants to know?
- We know people. Mickey from 46th.

181
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,484
- Dumb-Dumb.
- You know Mickey Dumb-Dumb?

182
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,945
- How you doin'?
- We were talkin' about you last night.

183
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:41,989
My buddy Angie.
Meet McBratney.

184
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:42,990
How you doin'?

185
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:46,201
- Where do you know Mickey from?
- We all worked Kennedy together.

186
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:59,423
- That's a good racket.
- We're movin' some stuff. Look.

187
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:00,841
Nice, huh?

188
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,344
You got more?

189
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,264
- Fourteen carat.
- It's nice, isn't it?

190
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:23,739
I got a gross sittin' in the trunk of
my car. Your name's written all over it.

191
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:26,116
- Let's go take a look.
- Excuse me!

192
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:31,079
Ferrone, 17th Squad.
You wanna step outside?

193
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:33,749
Where the hell did you get that,
some kind of a Cracker Jack box?

194
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:34,750
You fuckin' Guinea hump!

195
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,878
Take that fuckin' thing
and shove it up your ass along with...

196
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:50,516
Can't kill him, John.
You can't kill him.

197
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,643
He's Paul Castellano's soldier.

198
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:55,395
We need an okay, or else
you're steppin' way outta line here!

199
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,773
He fucked up the personal favor
I'm doin' for Don Carlo.

200
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:00,526
He's fuckin' goin'.

201
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:04,530
I know you're thinkin'
Castellano said use Galione.

202
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,073
He should've given us
Sammy Gravano.

203
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:09,368
You're thinkin' that Mick bartender's
gonna make us from fuckin' mug shots.

204
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,454
I'm not thinkin'.
You're thinkin'. I'm eatin'.

205
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,749
Now, he's goin'.

206
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:19,021
The bottom line is John Gotti...

207
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:22,107
clipped a soldier in my decina...

208
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,859
without my okay.

209
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:26,320
That's a flagrant violation.

210
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,405
John Gotti should fuckin' die.

211
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:32,910
No need to curse, Paul.
No need.

212
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,248
You know me, Don Carlo.

213
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:43,003
I'm a street guy.
If I can't curse, I can't talk.

214
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:45,839
You sent a fuckin' moron
on this hit...

215
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:50,177
who endangered the life of a young man
I think of as a son!

216
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:54,765
Galione deserved to be clipped!

217
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:59,353
John Gotti was doing a piece of work
that could buy him 25 years.

218
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:01,730
That's fuckin' immaterial!

219
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:04,191
The bottom line is that...

220
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:07,945
Bottom line.
That's weasel words!

221
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:10,531
My God,
a businessman talks like that.

222
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:11,949
What the hell kind of word is that?

223
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:16,453
Paul, you don't know the streets.

224
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:18,664
I mean, you never have.

225
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:24,586
John Gotti clipped your scumbag soldier
because your soldier deserved it.

226
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:26,839
John Gotti is Cosa Nostra.

227
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:37,641
The rule was broken.
Yes, it calls for Gotti to die.

228
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,770
Was there reason for breakin'
the rule so powerful...

229
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:44,481
that it was justified?

230
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:46,358
We need all the John Gotti's
we can get.

231
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:50,279
But we survive by our rules.

232
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:54,408
If it was my call, he would go.

233
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:10,924
Some combination, huh?

234
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:13,760
Your Frankie catchin'
and my son passin'?

235
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:16,513
Your kid's got a great arm.
Come here, you!

236
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:23,312
You gotta cradle the ball more.
Let me show you somethin'.

237
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:26,690
When he snaps it at you,
I want you to suck it in.

238
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,984
Suck it in. That's it.
Do it again.

239
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:32,362
He's gonna snap it at you...
a lateral pass.

240
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:34,448
- You gotta suck it in.
- Ready to go home yet?

241
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:36,617
No, I got my bike.
I'm gonna ride home.

242
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:39,411
- You were great.
- Thanks.

243
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:41,997
- You're doin' great, man.
- Thanks.

244
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:44,750
- You're my champ, you know that?
- Yeah.

245
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,502
Hey! Take that.

246
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:55,427
How's the couch business?
You still sellin' Castro convertibles?

247
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,386
It's a living.
Can't complain.

248
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:00,557
We gotta run.
You got a great arm, kid.

249
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,517
Thanks.

250
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,769
See ya next week.

251
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,926
I've been negotiating all night.

252
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:39,221
Just take a walk, all right?

253
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:49,147
- Negotiatin' what?
- Your fuckin' life!

254
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:51,275
- For takin' out a fuckin' coke head?
- Be quiet!

255
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:54,778
Sit down.

256
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:59,741
I said, sit down!

257
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:06,999
You know, I've clipped
a lot of guys in my life.

258
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,834
Close friends.

259
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,795
Guys I didn't know.

260
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:14,965
I didn't always agree
that the guy should be clipped.

261
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:18,051
But I never questioned the orders...

262
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,803
and I never went off half-cocked...

263
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,805
and clipped somebody
I wasn't supposed to!

264
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,432
Now, you shut up!

265
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,767
You just listen.

266
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:33,108
Big Paul went down to Don Carlo
for permission to have you whacked.

267
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:37,029
It came this close.

268
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:40,908
I told Don Carlo
you were like a son to me.

269
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:47,915
That touched the old man.
He told Paul to give you a pass.

270
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:52,920
But if Don Carlo had said...

271
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,755
you gotta go...

272
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,673
I would've come here today...

273
00:20:56,256 --> 00:21:01,053
with these two zips...

274
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:02,513
and you would go.

275
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:10,562
You cannot whack a made man
on somebody else's crew!

276
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:13,190
There are rules!

277
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:16,860
You break the rules,
this whole goddamn thing of ours...

278
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,736
cracks and crumbles!

279
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:22,491
You never break the rules.

280
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:34,461
Let's drink to that.

281
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,299
Wipe your face.

282
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:43,804
You're sweating up
a hundred dollar shirt.

283
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:47,015
Don Carlo says
you'll do some time.

284
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:49,685
But he's gonna take care
of your family.

285
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,061
Here.

286
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:58,068
La familia, and the rules
that hold us together.

287
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:06,952
And the rules that hold us together.

288
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:09,515
Good-bye, Frankie.

289
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:46,844
- You look good, John.
- Hey, thanks, man.

290
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:50,472
How do you swing a three-year sentence
with a guy dead on a saloon floor?

291
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,475
You just make sure it's
an Irish scumbag who deserved it.

292
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:55,978
This way, at least you know
you performed a public service.

293
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:08,532
Don Carlo made it official.
You come out of here...

294
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:11,952
you come out a captain.

295
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:15,289
God bless you, Neil.
God bless you.

296
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,876
How's my Frankie?

297
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:21,378
He's good.
Vicki and the kids are all fine.

298
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:25,716
Your mother, forget about her.

299
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,853
She told me the place
out in Sheepshead is a palace.

300
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:40,522
She called it that?

301
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:46,987
She told me,
"My son got me a palace."

302
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:52,451
It's not just Vicki and the kids.

303
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:54,411
The whole neighborhood
will be glad to have you back.

304
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:59,625
People ask about you all the time.

305
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,130
Got a bit of bad news.

306
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:08,342
Don Carlo had a...

307
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:09,927
had a heart attack.

308
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:16,308
Well, I guess when he goes,
you're gonna have your day.

309
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:18,810
- We'll see.
- What's that mean?

310
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:22,523
You're next in line.
What's that mean?

311
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,399
Listen.

312
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:27,945
I heard a little news
on the street that...

313
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:33,075
I heard that your brother Gene
and Angie's brother Sal...

314
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,784
are pushing dope.

315
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,120
- They're pushin' dope?
- Yeah.

316
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:39,998
Sally's not a made guy.
He's a civilian.

317
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:41,834
He does whatever the fuck he wants.

318
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:46,088
And my brother Gene's no genius,
but the guy's not pushin' dope.

319
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:51,093
Ask Angie. I understand
he's getting a percentage.

320
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:53,428
Where the fuck did you get this?

321
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:56,181
One of Big Paul's soldiers told me.

322
00:25:57,349 --> 00:26:00,853
Well, Jesus Christ.
Consider the source.

323
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:03,188
I'm only sittin' here
three fuckin' years...

324
00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:06,400
because of that incompetent
Sicilian candy-ass.

325
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:08,151
I'm supposed to believe
my own brother's pushin' dope?

326
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:10,153
Believe what you want.

327
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:14,658
But ask Angie.

328
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:18,412
I want this fuckin' rumor proved...

329
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:19,580
or disproved.

330
00:26:21,707 --> 00:26:24,793
An FBI spokesman said today
that a promising lead...

331
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:28,589
on the whereabouts of Patty Hearst
resulted in a dead end.

332
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:32,176
The young heiress is wanted in a series
of politically motivated bank robberies.

333
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:33,802
You know this bitch
is richer than Rockefeller?

334
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:37,723
With all her money, what's she doin'
tryin' to overthrow the government?

335
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:41,143
They're gonna lock up this twat for
100 fuckin' years when they catch her.

336
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,769
Come on, Johnny.

337
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:47,566
- You got anything you wanna tell me?
- Like what?

338
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:49,943
Like secret shit.

339
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:53,447
- Like what kinda secret shit?
- Like secret shit.

340
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:56,408
Like how many times a night
I whack off?

341
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:59,411
I said, like secret shit.

342
00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:02,122
You and me, we change each other's
diapers, for Christ's sake.

343
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:03,373
What fuckin' secrets I keep from you?

344
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:12,341
Where'd you get the prosciutto?

345
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:13,884
I know people.

346
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,262
We got a problem
with the Zulu chief.

347
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:20,432
He's threatin' to put a hit
on this kid Joey Perillo...

348
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:22,226
for stealin' six ounces
of nose candy from him.

349
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:25,437
- Yeah? Who is he?
- He's the kid at the end.

350
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:29,525
The skinny kid.

351
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:32,236
Who's the kid with?

352
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:33,904
Nobody. He's a street thief.

353
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:35,948
Then fuck him.
He's got nothin' to do with us.

354
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:40,160
But the kid says he knows Sammy Gravano.
He says him and Sammy go way back...

355
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:42,162
and there's no time
to check this out with Sammy.

356
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:47,209
- Do you believe him?
- Yeah, for sure he knows Sammy.

357
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:55,425
Better I stand up for Sammy in here than
find out I should've when I get out.

358
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:12,734
Hey, what's this motherfucker want?

359
00:28:16,238 --> 00:28:17,906
How ya doin', chief?

360
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:32,546
How about you and me,
we go for a walk and talk, huh?

361
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:38,760
What do you say?

362
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:43,807
I say a dago ain't a pimple
on a nigger's ass.

363
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:45,058
I sure as hell hope not.

364
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:54,234
What do you want me to do?
I'm alone here, see? I'm clean.

365
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:56,403
Step into my office here.
This is business.

366
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:58,322
Business, huh?

367
00:28:57,905 --> 00:29:02,284
You know you're one
crazy motherfuckin' wop, right?

368
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:06,955
Let's walk.

369
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:13,587
- I hear you're missin' 6 ounces of coke.
- You heard right.

370
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:16,882
And that Guinea Perillo,
he's gonna get a shiv stuck in his ass.

371
00:29:16,215 --> 00:29:20,928
You know, I say hard time
is for hard-ons.

372
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:23,138
What are we tryin' to do here?
We're tryin' to do some easy time.

373
00:29:22,596 --> 00:29:25,557
You start that shit, it's a lockdown.
Then what you got?

374
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:28,435
No booze, no broads,
no phones, no visitors.

375
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:30,729
You ain't even gonna get TV rights.

376
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:32,898
Come on.
You and me, we cool that, huh?

377
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,691
Yeah, well, I'm listening.

378
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:38,779
That 6 ounces of coke you lost,
I'm gonna replace it.

379
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:41,323
You're gonna get 18 grand cash
and a van full of Lucky's.

380
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:44,743
Your whole side of the yard here
can all be stokin' and smokin'...

381
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:47,371
your fuckin' brains out for a month
as far as I'm concerned.

382
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:49,957
From here on out,
anyone here in my court...

383
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:53,627
fucks with your action,
you just come to me.

384
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:56,922
- And who the fuck are you?
- John Gotti.

385
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:04,263
- So when do I get my drop?
- With your mornin' paper.

386
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:09,518
Count up in two wing.

387
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:26,785
Come on!
Let's have a little respect here!

388
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:28,245
Respect age, will ya?

389
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:32,749
Look at you!

390
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:46,305
College looks good on you.

391
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:54,313
Wait here.
Thank you, Willy.

392
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:10,120
- You okay?
- I got Neil here.

393
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:16,585
We're back!

394
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:25,302
What is it?

395
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,390
Don Carlo's dead.

396
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:32,893
Heart attack an hour ago.

397
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:37,314
Let him rest.

398
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:43,153
He made Big Paul the new boss
on his deathbed.

399
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:44,154
What?

400
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:49,117
No fuckin' way
Carlo passed you up.

401
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:51,370
For what?
That piece of shit?

402
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:55,415
He don't understand the street. He wants
to be some butter-ass businessman.

403
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:56,667
That's not Cosa Nostra.

404
00:31:56,291 --> 00:32:00,587
Maybe a street guy
is not what is needed.

405
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:02,589
Maybe times are changin'.

406
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:04,299
Bullshit! Come on!

407
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:07,678
The soldiers don't even want him.
Ask anyone here.

408
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,888
They starve under the guy.
The fuckin' guy...

409
00:32:09,388 --> 00:32:12,808
he squeezes a fuckin' quarter
till the eagle screams.

410
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:15,686
Don Carlo was the boss.

411
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:18,146
He picked his brother-in-law.

412
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:21,859
Now, Paul is the boss.
That is it.

413
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:24,444
Neil, you devoted
your life to this thing.

414
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:27,573
You never back-doored nobody,
never took a dime wasn't yours!

415
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:31,743
You want me to blow the fuckin' borgata
right now? Here, I'll do it right now!

416
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:53,432
The king is dead.
Long live his brother-in-law.

417
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:56,310
Johnny Boy doesn't seem to think so.

418
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:59,605
How many captains would behave
like that with Neil Dellacroce?

419
00:33:00,397 --> 00:33:05,944
You know, I think we got a little crack
developing in the Gambino family.

420
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:08,238
- Maybe more than meets the eye.
- Like what?

421
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:11,533
Gotti's heritage is Neapolitan.

422
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:14,494
Castellano is Sicilian,
like Don Carlo.

423
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:16,788
The rivalry's subtle,
but it's there.

424
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:23,754
"Never fear Rome.

425
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:26,715
The serpent lies coiled in Naples."

426
00:33:39,228 --> 00:33:44,149
First off, I want everybody to know
Tommy Bilotti continues as a captain.

427
00:33:43,232 --> 00:33:47,486
But he's also gonna be
my personal Doberman, right, Tommy?

428
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:48,278
Always, Paul. Always.

429
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:54,117
And Frankie De Cicco
is our new consigliere.

430
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:59,164
Armone, he wants
to get out of harness.

431
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:02,751
I've done my stint for 44 years.

432
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:05,087
I bought a little
hole-in-the-wall cafe in Astoria.

433
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:07,339
I could walk to work every morning
and get away from my wife.

434
00:34:11,844 --> 00:34:15,806
Anyone ever wants to consult,
come right over. Coffee's on me.

435
00:34:15,097 --> 00:34:19,142
Everyone at this table
should be proud to be sitting here...

436
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:20,269
in front of a man's man.

437
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:30,863
All right, finally.

438
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:36,785
I think everybody here knows
I'm keeping Neil on as my underboss.

439
00:34:35,576 --> 00:34:39,079
- It gives us some continuity.
- Grazie, Paul.

440
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:44,126
You know, I don't think
the Queens boys know DiB.

441
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:47,379
This is John Gotti,
Robert DiBernardo, known as DiB.

442
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:50,632
- I love your handkerchief.
- I was gonna say the same thing.

443
00:34:49,882 --> 00:34:52,426
That is Angelo Ruggeirio.

444
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:54,553
You know my tailor?

445
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:57,431
DiB runs all the porno in Brooklyn.

446
00:34:56,847 --> 00:35:01,351
You don't have to say anything about
John. His reputation precedes him.

447
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:05,063
All right, all right.
What's on the table?

448
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:12,321
I have Genovese people hijackin' three
loads outta Kennedy the last two months.

449
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:14,156
Colombos took off a couple too.

450
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:16,116
If I gotta rip somebody's
fuckin' eyes out here to...

451
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:18,744
Wait a minute.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

452
00:35:18,202 --> 00:35:20,204
Nobody's eyes
are gonna get ripped out.

453
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:24,583
- I'm ready to whack the motherfuckers!
- Nobody is gonna get whacked!

454
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:29,546
Not unless the boss
of this family approves.

455
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:32,925
Understood?

456
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:42,100
You've been away for a while.

457
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:44,311
Maybe you don't know
that we got...

458
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:48,565
a lot ofjoint ventures
with the Genoveses and Colombos.

459
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:51,485
The future of this family
doesn't depend on...

460
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:53,070
a couple of loads
from Kennedy anymore.

461
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:57,157
We're like United Nations now,
is that right?

462
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:07,251
Neil, you, me and Franike,
we'll work this Kennedy thing out later.

463
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:08,168
All right, next case.

464
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:11,630
All right.
Nicki Scibetta's gotta go.

465
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:13,715
Johnny, I want your crew to whack him.

466
00:36:13,215 --> 00:36:15,092
What do you mean, my crew?

467
00:36:15,926 --> 00:36:19,596
Nick Scibetta's in the construction
business with Sammy there in Brooklyn.

468
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:21,223
That's Brooklyn business.

469
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:23,934
That's why it makes more sense
for you guys to do the job.

470
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:27,104
I live in Queens, okay?
You whack your own people. Forget it.

471
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:31,233
- What do we got, two families here?
- Frankie, go fuck yourself.

472
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:33,652
We ain't got no problem here.
Nick's my brother-in-law.

473
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:37,489
He's my embarrassment.
I'll whack him nice and easy.

474
00:36:36,655 --> 00:36:39,908
We'll have the wake at Tomasulo's,
keep it in the neighborhood.

475
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:41,910
Good thinking, Sammy.
You stick with your in-laws.

476
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:43,871
I like that.

477
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:47,708
I gotta get back on the streets.
That's where all the money is.

478
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:51,253
Hey, Paul, not for nothin'.
That was a great spread.

479
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:06,101
The guy just got outta the joint,
for Christ's sake.

480
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:11,732
I mean, he's complicated,
but his motives are good.

481
00:37:10,522 --> 00:37:12,774
Besides, he's a good earner.

482
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:17,279
Hey, John's aces with me.
He got a kid I know...

483
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:19,573
out of a jam with the Zulus
up in Greenhaven.

484
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:20,782
He didn't have to.

485
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:25,245
Johnny's problem is that
he's a street Neapolitan, huh?

486
00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:28,415
Always scheming.

487
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:31,627
Worse than the Sicilians.

488
00:37:36,548 --> 00:37:39,343
Are you remindin' me now
what I owe you, cocksucker?

489
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:42,221
Have I ever missed settlin' with you?
Come on. I'm like a clock.

490
00:37:41,595 --> 00:37:43,597
Place the fuckin' bet.

491
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:48,519
Forgets who made him a rich fuckin' man.
Some fuckin' nerve.

492
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:51,438
John, why do you go nuts
every week tryin' to scrape up money?

493
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:53,440
What's Richie gonna do
if you just say "Go fuck yourself"?

494
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:55,817
A player loses, he pays.

495
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,778
A bookie loses, he pays.
Give me a break.

496
00:37:57,361 --> 00:38:00,948
- Tell it to the guys who owe us.
- Where's D'Mig?

497
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,992
At the warehouse with Bobby the Jew
tryin' to get rid of those watches.

498
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:06,620
By the time the fence takes its cut,
it's small potatoes.

499
00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:07,913
We're breakin' our balls for peanuts.

500
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:11,333
Not for nothin', but the guys
don't have two nickels to rub together.

501
00:38:10,624 --> 00:38:13,585
What are we doin' here, policy slips?
It's bullshit.

502
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:15,671
All you's do,
you cry like babies.

503
00:38:15,254 --> 00:38:17,673
All day long,
you bite my ass around the clock.

504
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:21,009
If I'm not in here havin' my famous
espresso with Tony Ducks by ten...

505
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:22,761
I'm back by noon
to check the numbers.

506
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:25,973
But I'm the one that goes down to
Mulberry to check it out with Mr. Neil.

507
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:30,143
I'm the one that goes to Staten Island
to pay respect to that lay-down Paul.

508
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:31,937
I gotta drink bitter coffee
'cause his spic maid...

509
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,939
cannot even run
a fuckin' espresso machine.

510
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:36,567
I gotta sit with that zombie Bilotti.
Doberman my ass!

511
00:38:36,024 --> 00:38:40,571
I gotta go out to the island now
to talk to Bobby about stolen watches?

512
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:42,739
Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?
I coulda been a meter maid.

513
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:46,785
I coulda worked for UP-fuckin'-S
and made more fuckin' money!

514
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:48,996
Where the fuck you come cryin'
to me about empty pockets?

515
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:51,039
Why don't you just say what you want.
What do you want?

516
00:38:50,581 --> 00:38:56,336
You want a piece of DiB's porn?
A piece of Sammy's construction?

517
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:57,880
What do you want,
demolitions, cement or garbage?

518
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:02,009
You want trucks, meat, fish, garment?
So the fuck do I!

519
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:09,183
Anybody got any ideas?

520
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:12,853
- I got one or two.
- Yeah?

521
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:14,771
- Here's the money!
- What the fuck?

522
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:16,315
Johnny! Come on!

523
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:20,777
Don't think for one minute you're not
diggin' into Angie's drug operation.

524
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:24,072
You and Angie and D'Mig
and your brother Sally are dealin'.

525
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,783
Don't ever fuckin' think
I don't know that.

526
00:39:28,452 --> 00:39:31,330
And I hear you with that
in the joint, Quack-Quack.

527
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:37,336
What's the matter now?
You got nothin' to say?

528
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:44,718
You got it wrong. Nobody's dealin'.
We're movin' a few things for Sally.

529
00:39:43,926 --> 00:39:47,262
You movin' furniture
for five dollars an hour?

530
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:49,097
Fuck you.

531
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:52,267
Let me tell you somethin'.

532
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:55,062
This Sicilian motherfucker
finds out you're dealin' heroin...

533
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:57,356
I can't save your ass,
and I'm the first to get hit.

534
00:39:56,897 --> 00:40:02,152
You know why? I don't let
anyone whack out my crew.

535
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:03,570
Now, is that what you want?

536
00:40:08,242 --> 00:40:10,202
Good.

537
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:21,171
What do you say the three of us
go down to Umberto's...

538
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:22,840
we get some scungillis,
we relax.

539
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:26,927
I'm relaxed.
I'm plenty relaxed.

540
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:30,597
I'm goin' down to Regine's,
have a drink with DiB.

541
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,976
I smell like a fuckin' animal now.

542
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:51,368
Hey, to each his own.

543
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:53,120
There's big bucks in it.
That's for sure.

544
00:40:52,703 --> 00:40:55,706
Hey, fuck this shit.
They lock you up forever.

545
00:40:55,205 --> 00:40:57,624
Money ain't a good enough reason
to do a hundred years.

546
00:40:57,207 --> 00:41:00,169
You like this joint, huh?

547
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:02,379
It's classy.

548
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:04,047
Classy?

549
00:41:03,714 --> 00:41:06,842
You got any idea how much money
this place must gross in a month?

550
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,801
Fuckin' Sammy.

551
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:11,430
He's all business, you know
what I mean? But he's right.

552
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:13,557
I wouldn't mind
a piece of this place myself.

553
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:14,808
Let me ask you something, John.

554
00:41:14,558 --> 00:41:17,728
How come you don't have a piece
of anything legitimate?

555
00:41:17,144 --> 00:41:23,192
DiB and me, we're in drywall,
construction, demolition, night clubs.

556
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:23,984
Legitimate, huh?

557
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:27,321
You know what I think is bullshit?
You should become CPAs.

558
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:29,573
I'm serious.
Certified Public Assholes.

559
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:34,453
This way you could have
your legitimate businesses...

560
00:41:34,036 --> 00:41:37,039
and your books
and your workman's comp...

561
00:41:36,496 --> 00:41:39,041
and your Blue Cross
and your Blue Shield.

562
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:42,085
And on top of that,
you go pay your taxes, all right?

563
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:45,506
You think I got a button to become
some kind of straight-up businessman?

564
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:47,466
- Get the fuck outta here.
- You know what I think?

565
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:52,554
Under these $2,000 suits,
you're really an old-timer.

566
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:54,139
Yeah, man.

567
00:41:53,722 --> 00:41:57,559
Gotta remember where we come from.

568
00:41:56,892 --> 00:41:59,978
Amen.

569
00:41:59,478 --> 00:42:02,481
Your boss is so busy
bein' a businessman...

570
00:42:01,939 --> 00:42:05,275
I can't even get the right backing
when I need it.

571
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,026
What's that about?

572
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:09,821
Not just our boss.

573
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,990
Don't get me wrong.
I know.

574
00:42:11,573 --> 00:42:15,702
Yeah, he's my boss.
He's my boss.

575
00:42:17,246 --> 00:42:21,667
Off the record, I'd been happy
to see Neil get it.

576
00:42:20,832 --> 00:42:23,836
Off the record,
I don't think anybody woulda cried...

577
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:25,838
if Mr. Neil got it.

578
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:30,133
But, you know, it's Cosa Nostra.
We got the boss we got.

579
00:42:32,845 --> 00:42:34,638
Here's to changin' the subject.

580
00:42:34,346 --> 00:42:36,348
To the boss!

581
00:42:40,352 --> 00:42:43,230
- I gotta get goin'.
- Where you goin'?

582
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:45,941
- Business or pleasure?
- What the fuck's the difference?

583
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:48,777
- There he goes.
- Take care.

584
00:42:49,528 --> 00:42:53,156
- Come here, you.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

585
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:58,161
A million a month gross, minimum.
I could be off by 50%.

586
00:42:57,369 --> 00:42:59,246
Fuckin' Sammy.

587
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:04,001
You know that contract
we got in Queens?

588
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:08,255
We're the low bidders, but it turns out
it's like one of those "modified" bids.

589
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:09,756
It's always modified...

590
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:11,842
modified to the point
where we can't make any money.

591
00:43:14,553 --> 00:43:17,431
Nicki, come here.

592
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:21,351
Take down that piece of drywall
up there, the one on the top.

593
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:24,479
For what?

594
00:43:27,733 --> 00:43:29,443
For what?

595
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:32,613
'Cause maybe you ain't buyin'
the kinda quality that you should.

596
00:43:37,743 --> 00:43:41,455
You don't trust nobody, man.

597
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,049
- What?
- Oh, fuck.

598
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:58,096
What are you doing?
Are you fuckin' nuts?

599
00:43:57,387 --> 00:44:01,099
When I first picked up this piece
of shit, I knew it was a mistake.

600
00:44:01,433 --> 00:44:03,977
- We're family.
- Son of a bitch.

601
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:05,812
I'm Deborah's brother,
for God's sake!

602
00:44:05,437 --> 00:44:08,482
Shut the fuck up, Nicki!

603
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,068
Don't kill me, please!
What did I do?

604
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:18,367
You know somethin'?
You are some whiner.

605
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,817
Oh, God!

606
00:45:36,987 --> 00:45:41,742
- Jesus, John. I'm so sorry.
- Hey, Sammy. How are ya?

607
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:47,414
Who done this?

608
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:49,583
Leave it alone.
It was an accident.

609
00:45:50,626 --> 00:45:53,420
Just had an accident, that's all.

610
00:45:56,006 --> 00:45:58,550
This isn't the time or the place
for all this.

611
00:45:58,133 --> 00:46:01,678
This is John's friends and family.

612
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:04,348
Just stay here.

613
00:46:05,974 --> 00:46:08,060
Thanks for comin', man.

614
00:46:27,037 --> 00:46:29,498
Who did this, Joe?

615
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:33,502
The guy that lives next door.
His name is Favara.

616
00:47:27,097 --> 00:47:30,726
My God, I am heartily sorry...

617
00:47:30,058 --> 00:47:32,477
for having offended Thee.

618
00:47:35,147 --> 00:47:38,275
And I detest all past sins...

619
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,821
for Thy just punishment.

620
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:51,121
But most of all
I have offended Thee.

621
00:47:53,498 --> 00:47:57,294
Oh, God...

622
00:47:56,627 --> 00:48:00,005
you're deserving of all my love.

623
00:48:01,507 --> 00:48:04,968
I from here resolve
to the top of Thy grace...

624
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:08,222
to sin no more.

625
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:41,839
Is this gonna take long?

626
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:43,757
It's 20,000 bucks I'm pickin' up.

627
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,760
We can afford a few minutes.
I'll be right back.

628
00:49:13,954 --> 00:49:18,083
Somebody's gotta move this thing
or they're not gonna have headlights!

629
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:23,380
I'll be out in a minute.
I'll move the car in a minute.

630
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:26,842
Hey, big shot, is this yours?

631
00:49:27,593 --> 00:49:30,637
Is that yours?

632
00:49:30,095 --> 00:49:32,598
Relax. I'll be out in a minute.

633
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:36,894
Is that yours?

634
00:49:38,645 --> 00:49:41,064
I'll call you back in a few minutes.

635
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:44,902
I'm sorry. What'd you say?

636
00:49:45,611 --> 00:49:47,279
Is that yours?

637
00:49:47,029 --> 00:49:50,157
- Is what mine?
- The Lincoln.

638
00:49:51,158 --> 00:49:54,369
What Lincoln?

639
00:50:07,508 --> 00:50:09,760
- Let him go!
- Calm down, man!

640
00:50:15,224 --> 00:50:19,770
Let go! John, a cop!
Get the fuck outta here!

641
00:50:18,936 --> 00:50:21,355
Mr. Cutler,
what's the real story here?

642
00:50:20,938 --> 00:50:25,984
There is no real story. My client
was tryin' to break up a fight.

643
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:27,653
What does this have to do
with loan-sharking?

644
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:30,322
- Did he owe you money?
- Don't be ridiculous.

645
00:50:29,738 --> 00:50:32,741
Mr. Gotti sells plumbing supplies.
That's all.

646
00:50:36,662 --> 00:50:40,791
Leave the man alone!
Leave the man alone!

647
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,709
What was your reaction
to these accusations?

648
00:50:42,251 --> 00:50:43,585
Take that.

649
00:50:43,377 --> 00:50:45,796
Do you always hand out fifties
to street people?

650
00:50:45,379 --> 00:50:47,506
Is that a fifty?
Take a hundred.

651
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:50,384
Give me back the fifty.

652
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,928
It's tough on the streets.
Everybody's gotta score once in a while.

653
00:50:52,386 --> 00:50:54,805
- That's why your neighborhood loves you.
- Could be.

654
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:57,933
How does it feel getting
a hundred dollars from John Gotti?

655
00:50:57,516 --> 00:51:01,687
My guess is that once this Piecyk
finds out who you are...

656
00:51:00,936 --> 00:51:03,397
he'll withdraw.

657
00:51:02,938 --> 00:51:06,650
But there's a bigger problem
comin' up.

658
00:51:05,983 --> 00:51:09,361
Not with you.
With your people.

659
00:51:08,777 --> 00:51:10,821
What do you mean, my people?

660
00:51:10,445 --> 00:51:14,575
Angelo Ruggeirio,
your brother Gene, D'Mig...

661
00:51:13,824 --> 00:51:17,828
on a heroin conspiracy...
indictment's comin' down this afternoon.

662
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,538
- Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?
- I'm not kiddin' you.

663
00:51:19,121 --> 00:51:24,084
And the really bad news is Angie's house
has been bugged for months.

664
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:28,547
Jesus Christ.

665
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:32,509
That stupid, greedy,
motherfuckin' moron!

666
00:51:33,135 --> 00:51:37,389
Goddamn him!
Goddamn him!

667
00:51:36,638 --> 00:51:39,933
Paul is gonna whack
the three of them.

668
00:51:39,308 --> 00:51:42,853
Yeah. And me too.

669
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:45,355
I got Moe, I got Larry,
and I got Curly.

670
00:51:44,813 --> 00:51:49,234
The bail I raised for you three,
I'll be broke here a fuckin' year!

671
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:53,155
How many times
we gotta go through this?

672
00:51:52,821 --> 00:51:57,242
We're in the street, scratchin'
and scrapin', so we took a taste.

673
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:58,243
We're just tryin' to survive.

674
00:51:57,951 --> 00:52:04,458
Angelo, how do you get caught
on a bug in your own house?

675
00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:05,584
Motherfuckers!

676
00:52:05,209 --> 00:52:07,336
Don't say motherfuckers, all right?

677
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,631
Even when you were a kid,
you don't shut your fuckin' mouth.

678
00:52:09,963 --> 00:52:13,842
That's why I called you Quack-Quack.
They don't have to bug you.

679
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:15,677
Anyone in New York
dials seven digits to get you.

680
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:17,888
I had my house swept
by this electronic expert.

681
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:19,848
The motherfucker told me it was safe.

682
00:52:19,431 --> 00:52:21,600
- Safe?
- Yeah.

683
00:52:21,225 --> 00:52:23,644
Have you heard of technology?

684
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:28,440
There is no "safe."

685
00:52:27,898 --> 00:52:30,817
Don't you know they got
a parabolic mike today?

686
00:52:30,275 --> 00:52:33,820
It could hear a fuckin' snake
fart in Egypt!

687
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:37,866
The Feds are a machine.
They don't run out of time or money!

688
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:40,869
They sent a whole fuckin' army
to grab 30 spics...

689
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:43,205
in that Caribbean shithole,
whatever the fuck it was.

690
00:52:42,746 --> 00:52:45,749
That's power, Angelo.
That's real power.

691
00:52:45,207 --> 00:52:48,919
You shut the fuck up for a minute.
I'm tryin' to make a point.

692
00:52:48,252 --> 00:52:51,421
That's the kind of power the Feds have
that made the bosses...

693
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:53,966
ban the goddamn drugs
in the first place!

694
00:52:53,423 --> 00:52:58,554
Every fuckin' boss of every family's
into drug money, off the record.

695
00:52:57,594 --> 00:52:59,137
Paul's full of shit.

696
00:52:58,887 --> 00:53:01,640
He's takin' fuckin' drug money
from Roy De Meo.

697
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:04,309
He don't ask where the cash
comes from, but he knows.

698
00:53:03,767 --> 00:53:05,519
- So he's a hypocrite?
- Yeah.

699
00:53:05,227 --> 00:53:07,646
Is this somethin' new?

700
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:11,108
He's the boss!

701
00:53:10,607 --> 00:53:14,945
Do you get it?
He's the boss.

702
00:53:18,323 --> 00:53:21,994
- How bad are these tapes?
- Forget about it.

703
00:53:21,326 --> 00:53:25,789
I said a lot of shit about people,
about Paul too.

704
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:39,720
- Paul, good swim?
- I should be doin' more of this.

705
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:43,265
Helps me sleep better.

706
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:48,854
I sat down with the Colombos...

707
00:53:48,187 --> 00:53:51,857
and those asbestos removal contracts...

708
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:54,902
that you guys got in
with the Board of Ed.

709
00:53:54,276 --> 00:53:57,529
Anyhow, I agreed to up
their end of it to 40 percent.

710
00:53:56,987 --> 00:53:59,239
- 40 percent?
- Jesus, Paul.

711
00:53:58,864 --> 00:54:02,075
They don't even deserve the 30 percent
they're in for now.

712
00:54:01,533 --> 00:54:05,579
I know for a fact when Don Carlo
was alive, they were lucky to get ten.

713
00:54:04,828 --> 00:54:07,247
Don Carlo's been dead
for a long time now.

714
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:12,127
And Neil, when Neil goes,
that's the end of that regime.

715
00:54:11,126 --> 00:54:15,130
Finished.
This is a new age.

716
00:54:14,379 --> 00:54:16,965
We got more money to make...

717
00:54:16,548 --> 00:54:19,551
workin' with the other families
than shuttin' them out.

718
00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:21,470
Me and the Colombos...

719
00:54:21,053 --> 00:54:27,142
we also had a little talk
about our John Gotti problem.

720
00:54:27,684 --> 00:54:30,145
What John Gotti problem?

721
00:54:29,728 --> 00:54:32,856
- What's the matter withJohnny?
- You mean the Ruggeirio thing?

722
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:36,401
What John Gotti problem?
What problem?

723
00:54:35,651 --> 00:54:40,322
Don't you guys fuckin' read?
Give me that newspaper.

724
00:54:41,406 --> 00:54:44,159
When the New York Times carries it,
you got trouble.

725
00:54:43,659 --> 00:54:46,453
I had dinner last week
with this chicken guy.

726
00:54:45,953 --> 00:54:48,622
What's his name?
Looks like a chicken.

727
00:54:48,163 --> 00:54:50,582
What's he gonna think
when he sees these headlines?

728
00:54:50,165 --> 00:54:53,252
These guys are not stupid.
They know who we are.

729
00:54:52,709 --> 00:54:56,213
But it's not supposed
to be so public.

730
00:54:56,964 --> 00:55:00,133
This John Gotti is like
some throw back to our street days.

731
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:03,178
Goes to work on some guy
with a baseball bat in the street!

732
00:55:02,511 --> 00:55:06,139
The guy jumped him with a bat.
John's got a temper. So what?

733
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:08,684
- The guy's a hell of...
- What? An earner?

734
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:10,727
Yeah, I know.

735
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:13,772
What the hell is it
with these $3,000 suits?

736
00:55:13,146 --> 00:55:16,400
The man dresses better than Cuomo.

737
00:55:17,568 --> 00:55:19,987
And these FBI bugs.

738
00:55:21,071 --> 00:55:23,490
Who knows what's on
those fuckin' tapes?

739
00:55:25,284 --> 00:55:27,244
Do you?

740
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:31,999
Who the hell knows what kind of shit
that fat fuck Angie talked about me.

741
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:38,297
Anyway, if we gotta whack
John and his crew...

742
00:55:37,462 --> 00:55:39,882
the Colombos are givin' us
the soldiers to do it.

743
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,218
Who's talkin' about
whackin'John Gotti?

744
00:55:44,678 --> 00:55:50,434
This way, it keeps us from having
war within the family.

745
00:55:49,391 --> 00:55:54,813
Paul, as your consigliere,
I have an obligation to tell you this.

746
00:55:53,812 --> 00:55:58,192
It's not right for us to reveal family
problems in front of the Colombos.

747
00:55:57,399 --> 00:56:01,111
- It weakens us.
- It weakens nothin'.

748
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:04,072
If those tapes show that Angie
and those two other Mamelukes...

749
00:56:03,405 --> 00:56:09,620
are dealin' powder,
the rule since 1957 is deal and die.

750
00:56:08,493 --> 00:56:12,456
I gotta clip 'em,
and Johnny Boy too.

751
00:56:19,254 --> 00:56:22,674
What's up, fellas?

752
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:24,635
Can we go off the record here?

753
00:56:24,176 --> 00:56:27,262
- Absolutely.
- All right.

754
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,473
What Carlo built up for 30 years
with his blood...

755
00:56:28,972 --> 00:56:31,767
this prick is givin' away
piece by piece.

756
00:56:31,266 --> 00:56:33,769
The other families
are gonna piss all over us.

757
00:56:33,352 --> 00:56:36,396
He's not tryin' to build.
Mark my words, Sammy.

758
00:56:35,854 --> 00:56:38,899
We're gonna starve with this guy.

759
00:56:38,357 --> 00:56:42,819
Off the record,
I agree with you 100 percent.

760
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:44,488
I'll tell you one other thing.

761
00:56:44,071 --> 00:56:49,284
This guy don't understand
for one fuckin' minute who Gotti is.

762
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:52,871
You all right?

763
00:56:54,623 --> 00:56:57,084
You gotta get to a hospital.

764
00:56:58,043 --> 00:57:02,589
- You hear me?
- What good would that do?

765
00:57:01,797 --> 00:57:05,634
They just wanna shoot
that toxic shit into me, and I...

766
00:57:04,967 --> 00:57:08,095
I'll die that much sooner.

767
00:57:07,553 --> 00:57:10,138
I just don't wanna...

768
00:57:09,721 --> 00:57:13,433
I don't wanna leave
a war behind me.

769
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,020
He would be within his rights.

770
00:57:16,728 --> 00:57:20,899
Paul has every right
to whack out your whole crew.

771
00:57:22,484 --> 00:57:28,073
"Deal and die."
That was Carlo's edict.

772
00:57:26,989 --> 00:57:28,490
Right, right.

773
00:57:28,282 --> 00:57:34,079
And that's why Carlo Gambino wasn't
takin' drug money off De Meo like Paul.

774
00:57:32,995 --> 00:57:36,582
Paulie ain't one tenth of Carlo Gambino.
You know that.

775
00:57:35,914 --> 00:57:39,459
Carlo ran this family
like it was supposed to be run.

776
00:57:38,834 --> 00:57:41,670
Like a brotherhood.
But it was our thing.

777
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:44,590
Paulie runs it like it's his thing.
Carlo would step out of the grave.

778
00:57:43,964 --> 00:57:47,259
He'd set this whole thing right,
if he could.

779
00:57:48,385 --> 00:57:50,804
Nobody in my crew is gettin' clipped.
That's all.

780
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:53,265
If anybody's gettin' clipped,
it's Paul.

781
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:59,396
I brought you into this family.
I made you what you are.

782
00:57:58,729 --> 00:58:02,482
You're strong and you're smart.

783
00:58:01,773 --> 00:58:04,860
But don't ever believe that
you are bigger than anything...

784
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:06,737
- I don't think I'm bigger...
- Don't interrupt...

785
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,739
Don't interrupt me.

786
00:58:10,073 --> 00:58:13,160
I know what you're thinkin'.

787
00:58:12,576 --> 00:58:15,787
But you cannot whack out a boss.

788
00:58:15,245 --> 00:58:19,708
Only the full commission
could make that call.

789
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:24,338
I love you like a son...

790
00:58:24,755 --> 00:58:29,259
but don't ever put me
on the spot.

791
00:58:29,426 --> 00:58:34,348
And don't ever force my hand.

792
00:58:34,932 --> 00:58:37,351
I would never do that.

793
00:58:44,566 --> 00:58:47,236
Let's take a walk, huh?

794
00:58:55,994 --> 00:58:59,790
I gotta tell you, we can't clear this
with any of the bosses.

795
00:58:59,164 --> 00:59:01,625
It's our family, it's our move.
Nobody gives a fuck...

796
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:03,710
about this greedy cazzo.

797
00:59:03,335 --> 00:59:07,214
- When?
- Not until Neil goes.

798
00:59:06,505 --> 00:59:09,383
All right, DiB's
with us all the way.

799
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:11,969
De Cicco says you oughta get
all the cappo regimes together...

800
00:59:11,468 --> 00:59:13,303
and make 'em vote right away.

801
00:59:13,011 --> 00:59:15,472
That'll make it official.

802
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:19,935
He can deliver Joe Armone
out of retirement to sit next to you.

803
00:59:19,017 --> 00:59:21,979
That oughta give it some weight.

804
00:59:21,478 --> 00:59:23,897
You're gonna be underboss.

805
00:59:24,523 --> 00:59:26,525
You ready?

806
00:59:29,528 --> 00:59:31,947
Frankie De Cicco will be consigliere.

807
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:38,078
With him, we're tight.
Yeah, real tight.

808
00:59:37,077 --> 00:59:41,456
Pull it tight like no government
nowhere is ever gonna break this.

809
00:59:40,664 --> 00:59:43,458
We're gonna make a powerhouse now.

810
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:49,089
A Cosa Nostra ain't seen
since Anastasia.

811
00:59:48,422 --> 00:59:51,091
Anastasia?

812
00:59:50,632 --> 00:59:53,760
Shit, this is bigger
than killin' the fuckin' president.

813
00:59:53,218 --> 00:59:58,348
Hey, you think I was put on this Earth
to make them rich and me poor?

814
00:59:57,389 --> 01:00:02,311
We're gonna do a hit now.
We're gonna do a real hit.

815
01:00:03,145 --> 01:00:05,147
We're goin' back.

816
01:00:07,149 --> 01:00:09,776
Back to some real in-your-face
Cosa Nostra.

817
01:00:09,318 --> 01:00:11,737
Out in front on the line.

818
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:13,822
Make 'em sit back
and watch the volcano blow.

819
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:16,325
You with me?

820
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:19,161
I'm with you.

821
01:00:18,577 --> 01:00:20,787
All the way to the finish.

822
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:40,516
We had it all.
The booze, the girls.

823
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:43,101
Pockets full of money.

824
01:00:49,816 --> 01:00:52,945
I had a girl.

825
01:00:52,402 --> 01:00:54,863
Was that that Irish girl?

826
01:00:54,488 --> 01:00:56,156
Yeah.

827
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:04,456
I could go two, three days
without sleep.

828
01:01:03,705 --> 01:01:05,541
My God.

829
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,254
I was so strong.

830
01:01:12,381 --> 01:01:17,636
You know, you live
this goddamn life long enough...

831
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:23,267
and you can't take anything
with you except...

832
01:01:22,891 --> 01:01:24,768
your honor.

833
01:01:25,644 --> 01:01:30,023
Don't ever lose that, Johnny.

834
01:01:35,696 --> 01:01:39,658
This whole fuckin' thing...

835
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:45,497
lasts only five minutes.

836
01:02:21,116 --> 01:02:22,951
He's gone...

837
01:02:23,785 --> 01:02:27,789
and that fuck Castellano
never even come say good-bye.

838
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:18,590
What did DeCicco need this meetin' for?
I got shoppin' to do.

839
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:22,135
Probably another beef
about the fuckin' garbage routes.

840
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:24,096
Yeah, more garbage.

841
01:03:51,164 --> 01:03:54,334
It's gonna cost us another 20 bucks
to park this thing.

842
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:57,379
We ought to get into
these Manhattan parking lots.

843
01:03:57,754 --> 01:04:00,257
It's a license to steal.

844
01:04:01,133 --> 01:04:02,509
Let me out.

845
01:05:15,791 --> 01:05:18,502
- La famiglia!
- La famiglia!

846
01:05:42,317 --> 01:05:44,194
Here he comes.

847
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:51,410
Hey, John, who's your tailor?

848
01:05:50,909 --> 01:05:55,497
Mr. Gotti, did you have anything to do
with the Paul Castellano murder?

849
01:05:54,663 --> 01:05:58,667
Is it true you're the new boss
of the Gambino family?

850
01:05:57,916 --> 01:06:00,836
I ask you to look around
the courtroom, Mr. Piecyk...

851
01:06:01,753 --> 01:06:05,257
and identify the man
who assaulted you.

852
01:06:10,137 --> 01:06:11,388
I don't see him.

853
01:06:13,348 --> 01:06:15,142
Take off your glasses, please.

854
01:06:16,393 --> 01:06:21,064
Now, study the defendant.

855
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:27,613
I never seen that guy before.

856
01:06:33,285 --> 01:06:35,245
You're under oath.

857
01:06:34,912 --> 01:06:37,998
You have never before
seen this man?

858
01:06:37,456 --> 01:06:41,210
Yeah, I seen Mr. Gotti
on TV and the newspapers.

859
01:06:40,501 --> 01:06:42,377
I never met the man.

860
01:06:42,127 --> 01:06:45,005
Are you telling this court
that John Gotti...

861
01:06:44,505 --> 01:06:48,800
is not the same man you incriminated
on an assault warrant?

862
01:06:48,008 --> 01:06:52,513
It was a long time ago.
I don't remember. I'm sorry.

863
01:06:53,138 --> 01:06:56,058
Any further questions,
Mr. Bartley?

864
01:06:55,516 --> 01:06:59,228
- No, Your Honor, I think it's clear.
- Mr. Cutler.

865
01:07:00,521 --> 01:07:01,730
Your Honor...

866
01:07:01,522 --> 01:07:04,566
I respectfully move
for a dismissal...

867
01:07:04,024 --> 01:07:05,817
of all charges.

868
01:07:09,196 --> 01:07:11,073
Motion granted.

869
01:07:18,247 --> 01:07:20,040
There he is!

870
01:07:28,382 --> 01:07:30,801
You beat 'em, John!

871
01:07:30,425 --> 01:07:32,761
I can't believe
this son of a bitch.

872
01:07:32,344 --> 01:07:34,763
Every time he beats a rap,
his popularity goes up.

873
01:07:34,346 --> 01:07:38,600
- He's making us look like idiots.
- Our day will come, believe me.

874
01:07:37,808 --> 01:07:40,310
See the fireworks
on the way over?

875
01:07:39,893 --> 01:07:42,479
John's tossing a block party
for beating the case.

876
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:44,523
Yeah, right.
Everybody loves him.

877
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:48,485
He whacks out Paul Castellano
in the middle of 46th Street.

878
01:07:47,818 --> 01:07:50,112
Where are the New York cops?

879
01:07:49,736 --> 01:07:53,615
And now it's some
unsolved homicide.

880
01:07:52,906 --> 01:07:57,202
Now this Piecyk thing. How do you
think this egomaniac must feel?

881
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:57,661
Untouchable.

882
01:07:57,452 --> 01:08:01,540
Son of a bitch is sitting on
a $500 million-a-year enterprise...

883
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:03,208
and he knows
how to spread it around.

884
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:04,668
Correction.

885
01:08:04,376 --> 01:08:09,089
He's sitting on top of a $500
million-a-year criminal enterprise.

886
01:08:08,213 --> 01:08:11,258
This is no Fortune 500 company
he's running here.

887
01:08:10,716 --> 01:08:13,927
Are you forgetting the prosecutor
spent the last year...

888
01:08:13,343 --> 01:08:15,888
building a RICO case
against him?

889
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:19,683
You guys don't get it.
I want this guy.

890
01:08:20,642 --> 01:08:24,938
So spread the money around.
Offer immunity to some hard-timers.

891
01:08:24,146 --> 01:08:29,484
We'll spend 24 hours a day in that room
if we have to. I do not care!

892
01:08:35,157 --> 01:08:37,618
He's doing business
somewhere in the building.

893
01:08:37,242 --> 01:08:39,703
We find out where,
we got him.

894
01:08:39,328 --> 01:08:43,832
I do not want this son of a bitch
as the next mayor of New York.

895
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,292
Only Sally.

896
01:08:44,917 --> 01:08:49,963
He gets arrested in a rented Mercedes.

897
01:08:49,004 --> 01:08:53,509
I think the Feds wired his mailbox.
Anyway, they're goin' through his car.

898
01:08:52,674 --> 01:08:55,344
They find two Berettas
in the glove compartment...

899
01:08:54,885 --> 01:08:57,012
and an axe under the front seat.

900
01:08:56,678 --> 01:08:59,097
A fuckin' axe, right?

901
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,934
So they're lookin' at him.
They say...

902
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:05,479
"You got any idea why there's
two handguns in the glove box...

903
01:09:04,728 --> 01:09:07,397
and an axe
under the front seat?"

904
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:09,399
Sally says,
"Are you serious?

905
01:09:08,982 --> 01:09:12,444
I will never rent a car
from fuckin' Avis again."

906
01:09:16,365 --> 01:09:17,908
Hey, Bruce!

907
01:09:20,953 --> 01:09:24,498
Get over here, you cocksucker.
Where you been?

908
01:09:23,872 --> 01:09:26,875
- Long story.
- Yeah?

909
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:29,461
I thought you should know this
sooner than later.

910
01:09:28,919 --> 01:09:32,631
I got something for you,
but strictly off the record.

911
01:09:32,005 --> 01:09:35,133
So we'll go upstairs.
Come on.

912
01:09:36,635 --> 01:09:39,888
- Who's place is this?
- Mikey Cirelli's.

913
01:09:39,304 --> 01:09:41,890
- I thought he was dead.
- He is.

914
01:09:41,431 --> 01:09:43,934
Maybe that's why
there's nobody here.

915
01:09:44,518 --> 01:09:46,103
So what's goin' on?

916
01:09:45,853 --> 01:09:49,606
U.S. Attorney's office has been working
a whole year on a RICO case...

917
01:09:48,939 --> 01:09:51,567
against you, your brother Gene,
Angelo and D'Mig.

918
01:09:51,108 --> 01:09:53,902
- Damn these fucks.
- I'm sorry.

919
01:09:54,778 --> 01:09:58,615
- They don't let you live.
- Yeah, I know.

920
01:09:57,948 --> 01:10:00,617
Let me go through
this RICO thing again.

921
01:10:00,117 --> 01:10:04,329
It says if anyone anywhere
is caught doin' anything wrong...

922
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:06,540
then everyone is guilty
up and down the line.

923
01:10:05,998 --> 01:10:08,792
Wait a minute.
This is a law...

924
01:10:08,292 --> 01:10:11,879
Yeah, it is the government's license
to throw out the Constitution.

925
01:10:11,253 --> 01:10:15,966
If they can prove that somebody is part
of a continuing criminal enterprise...

926
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:17,593
they can lock 'em up
for life.

927
01:10:17,134 --> 01:10:20,304
"Continuing criminal enterprise."
I don't know what the fuck that means.

928
01:10:19,761 --> 01:10:22,472
Did they lock up Nixon for life
when they raided...

929
01:10:22,014 --> 01:10:24,766
his Democratic National Headquarters,
whatever the fuck they were?

930
01:10:24,266 --> 01:10:25,517
The Plumbers.

931
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:29,021
He had an ongoing criminal enterprise
his entire career.

932
01:10:28,353 --> 01:10:30,022
That's a RICO case.

933
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:33,692
The assistant U.S. Attorney on this case
does not see you as a defendant.

934
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:37,404
- To her, you're some kind of trophy.
- "Her"? Who "her"?

935
01:10:36,570 --> 01:10:40,407
- Diane Giacalone. Very ambitious.
- Would you forget about it?

936
01:10:39,698 --> 01:10:43,660
No brush named Giacalone
is gonna be jerkin' me off for long.

937
01:10:42,951 --> 01:10:45,829
And would you tell her
to leave us the fuck alone?

938
01:10:45,329 --> 01:10:48,332
And another thing,
I don't wanna be alone tonight.

939
01:10:49,374 --> 01:10:52,336
You remember? Who was the guy?
Tony Rigoletto.

940
01:10:51,835 --> 01:10:54,338
No. Rigoletto is an opera.

941
01:10:53,879 --> 01:10:57,090
- It was Tony Rigatto.
- I'm talkin' about opera.

942
01:10:56,548 --> 01:11:01,595
The guy could sing an entire opera
in Italian word for word...

943
01:11:00,677 --> 01:11:02,721
didn't speak a word of Italian.

944
01:11:02,387 --> 01:11:05,015
He was like an idiot savant.

945
01:11:04,598 --> 01:11:07,935
These guys are retarded,
but they do one thing perfect.

946
01:11:07,392 --> 01:11:09,520
How come only servants
can do this stuff?

947
01:11:09,186 --> 01:11:12,022
- Savant!
- What servant?

948
01:11:11,563 --> 01:11:14,024
You fuckin' idiot!

949
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:23,075
You know, I gotta say this.

950
01:11:23,534 --> 01:11:25,994
- You got everyone's respect here.
- Thanks, John.

951
01:11:25,577 --> 01:11:29,039
I mean that. I was gonna say
you dress classy too...

952
01:11:28,413 --> 01:11:30,832
but I don't want you
to get a swell head.

953
01:11:30,415 --> 01:11:32,167
Thanks, John.

954
01:11:31,917 --> 01:11:36,964
Paul thought of me as a money machine.
It's good to be treated as a friend.

955
01:11:36,004 --> 01:11:39,716
Hey, you are a friend,
and Sammy G's a friend...

956
01:11:39,049 --> 01:11:41,051
and what is with this guy?

957
01:11:40,717 --> 01:11:43,887
His fuckin' wife has got him home
6:00 every night.

958
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:45,931
Unless he's out whacking somebody.

959
01:11:49,977 --> 01:11:51,186
Mr. Gotti?

960
01:11:54,189 --> 01:11:57,651
Mr. Gotti?
Hi. Nice to meet you.

961
01:11:57,025 --> 01:11:59,653
My name's Roger,
and this is my wife, Ann.

962
01:11:59,194 --> 01:12:02,197
We came in from Rochester
for the weekend...

963
01:12:01,655 --> 01:12:04,658
and no one's gonna believe
we actually met you.

964
01:12:04,157 --> 01:12:05,784
We just got married.

965
01:12:05,492 --> 01:12:07,494
They just got married!

966
01:12:08,161 --> 01:12:11,415
Give 'em a bottle of champagne.

967
01:12:10,831 --> 01:12:13,667
- Thank you very much.
- Get his autograph.

968
01:12:13,166 --> 01:12:16,044
I'll give you an autograph.
Tommy, come here.

969
01:12:17,963 --> 01:12:19,548
Thank you very much.

970
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:30,309
John Gotti, I'm FBI Agent Russo,
this is Agent Gabriel.

971
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:32,644
Russo. You know
what FBI means, right?

972
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:34,104
Why don't you tell me.

973
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:36,565
"Forever Bother the Italians."

974
01:12:36,064 --> 01:12:40,611
An FBI bug has picked up information
we think you might be interested in.

975
01:12:39,776 --> 01:12:41,028
No kidding.

976
01:12:40,861 --> 01:12:43,530
A capo in the Bonanno Family
has been recorded stating...

977
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:45,324
that the Commission
has sanctioned a hit on you.

978
01:12:47,492 --> 01:12:48,994
Thanks for the tip.

979
01:12:48,744 --> 01:12:52,664
We have a legal
and moral obligation to inform you.

980
01:12:51,955 --> 01:12:54,917
Legal and moral, is it?
Let's not bullshit each other.

981
01:12:54,374 --> 01:12:56,960
- You'd be happy to see me go.
- Not at all.

982
01:12:56,543 --> 01:12:59,087
We're gonna
take you down ourselves.

983
01:13:13,685 --> 01:13:17,397
Mr. Gotti, what are your feelings
about the RICO law?

984
01:13:16,772 --> 01:13:19,233
John, are you ready
for the end of this trial?

985
01:13:18,815 --> 01:13:20,651
I'm always ready.

986
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:26,323
Are you the boss
of the Gambino family?

987
01:13:25,739 --> 01:13:29,034
I'm a member of the Gotti family.
My wife Vicki's the boss.

988
01:13:33,038 --> 01:13:35,541
For seven torturous months...

989
01:13:35,123 --> 01:13:39,795
the government has been trying
to sell you on this indictment.

990
01:13:38,919 --> 01:13:41,380
This indictment stinks.

991
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:47,344
And a fancy wine dressing called RICO
isn't going to make it any better.

992
01:13:46,385 --> 01:13:48,011
It's still rancid.

993
01:13:47,761 --> 01:13:50,264
It is still rotten.

994
01:13:49,805 --> 01:13:53,308
Still makes you retch and vomit.

995
01:13:53,684 --> 01:13:56,019
To be brief...

996
01:13:55,644 --> 01:13:59,565
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
there is no case.

997
01:13:58,814 --> 01:14:04,403
You can convict John Gotti
because he curses on the telephone.

998
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:07,197
You can convict John Gotti
because he gambles excessively.

999
01:14:06,488 --> 01:14:09,283
- You can convict John Gotti...
- You see Juror Number 5?

1000
01:14:08,824 --> 01:14:12,202
Because he lives a life style
which you may or may not...

1001
01:14:11,577 --> 01:14:13,203
What about him?

1002
01:14:12,953 --> 01:14:15,455
- But that is not...
- We own him.

1003
01:14:14,997 --> 01:14:16,999
What my client is charged with!

1004
01:14:16,665 --> 01:14:19,543
- Worst-case, it's a hung jury.
- You want to get John Gotti?

1005
01:14:20,502 --> 01:14:23,088
You do it the right way.

1006
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:26,133
Do it the American way.

1007
01:14:25,674 --> 01:14:28,177
The jury has reached a verdict.

1008
01:14:30,512 --> 01:14:35,184
Defendant Joseph Dimiglia:
Not guilty on all counts.

1009
01:14:34,308 --> 01:14:36,602
Yes!

1010
01:14:36,185 --> 01:14:37,936
That's what I been tellin' youse.

1011
01:14:39,438 --> 01:14:41,940
If you can't control your selves...

1012
01:14:41,523 --> 01:14:44,568
you will spend the next 30 days
in this building...

1013
01:14:44,026 --> 01:14:46,862
- and if you think that I'm kidding...
- Are we in grade school?

1014
01:14:46,361 --> 01:14:49,239
- I invite you to try it.
- This is bullshit.

1015
01:14:48,739 --> 01:14:52,784
Defendant Angelo Ruggiero:
Not guilty on all counts.

1016
01:14:52,075 --> 01:14:54,077
Defendant Gene Gotti:

1017
01:14:53,744 --> 01:14:56,205
Not guilty on all counts.

1018
01:14:57,581 --> 01:15:00,000
Defendant John Gotti:

1019
01:15:01,502 --> 01:15:03,253
Not guilty on all counts.

1020
01:15:25,108 --> 01:15:28,695
John Gotti has beaten
a federal RICO case.

1021
01:15:28,028 --> 01:15:30,447
After seven months of testimony...

1022
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:35,702
Gotti has once again proven to be immune
to government efforts to convict him.

1023
01:15:34,618 --> 01:15:37,871
The "Dapper Don"
is now the "Teflon Don."

1024
01:15:37,287 --> 01:15:39,915
- Can I have your view on the trial?
- John Gotti?

1025
01:15:39,456 --> 01:15:42,584
Have you ever walked into
the Boys' Club on the East Side?

1026
01:15:42,042 --> 01:15:45,295
Every bit of equipment
bought by John Gotti.

1027
01:15:44,711 --> 01:15:47,381
Ma'am, can I have
your view on the trial?

1028
01:15:46,922 --> 01:15:48,757
We love him.

1029
01:15:48,465 --> 01:15:51,260
The government should
just leave the poor man alone.

1030
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:55,472
Perhaps the most personable gangland
boss ever to grace the Big Apple.

1031
01:15:54,596 --> 01:15:58,267
John Gottis, in underworld terms...

1032
01:15:57,599 --> 01:16:01,019
the undisputed
"King of the Volcano."

1033
01:16:08,652 --> 01:16:10,320
You rule, John!

1034
01:16:21,874 --> 01:16:25,252
You know why the people
in this city love me?

1035
01:16:24,668 --> 01:16:27,838
I'm beatin' the same system now
that's fuckin' them every day.

1036
01:16:27,254 --> 01:16:29,548
Everybody loves
a celebrity gangster.

1037
01:16:29,173 --> 01:16:31,592
You forget your father
was a rich businessman.

1038
01:16:31,175 --> 01:16:34,553
You don't know the system
from the outside. They know.

1039
01:16:33,927 --> 01:16:35,596
They know I know.

1040
01:16:35,345 --> 01:16:37,848
Whatever you say, John.

1041
01:16:39,391 --> 01:16:42,186
You know, Frankie...

1042
01:16:41,685 --> 01:16:44,354
why would a guy born of money
choose our life?

1043
01:16:51,361 --> 01:16:52,821
- Hey, Angie.
- What?

1044
01:16:52,571 --> 01:16:57,409
Three guys sittin' in a car.
Mexican, black guy and a Puerto Rican.

1045
01:16:56,533 --> 01:16:57,784
- Who's drivin'?
- The black guy.

1046
01:16:57,576 --> 01:17:00,078
- Puerto Rican.
- The police.

1047
01:17:01,872 --> 01:17:04,082
- You seen a fuckin' doctor?
- No.

1048
01:17:03,707 --> 01:17:06,126
Will you please go see
Gennaro on Prince Street?

1049
01:17:05,709 --> 01:17:09,171
Bulldoze your way in.
Don't sit in no waitin' room.

1050
01:17:08,545 --> 01:17:11,381
If I'm gonna see a doctor,
I'm gonna see a Jew doctor.

1051
01:17:10,881 --> 01:17:13,550
Jews, Wops, Chinks, Zulus...

1052
01:17:13,091 --> 01:17:16,637
It's one world, it's one people.
Would you stop it with that shit?

1053
01:17:15,969 --> 01:17:18,639
Not when it comes to doctors.

1054
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:21,600
John, I gotta talk to you
private for a minute.

1055
01:17:20,974 --> 01:17:25,020
What's the matter? All right.
Tell Vic I'll be up in a minute.

1056
01:17:24,269 --> 01:17:26,772
- We're late as it is.
- The guy can't wait?

1057
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:29,316
Tell him I'll be in there.

1058
01:17:28,774 --> 01:17:31,610
Go on. What is it?

1059
01:17:31,151 --> 01:17:33,695
I heard DiB sayin' some things.

1060
01:17:33,237 --> 01:17:37,032
He says if you're goin' away on this
RICO thing, Sammy should be the boss.

1061
01:17:36,323 --> 01:17:39,785
- That's bullshit.
- No, it ain't!

1062
01:17:39,159 --> 01:17:41,662
I know you're pissed off at me,
but it's true.

1063
01:17:41,245 --> 01:17:43,747
I'm not pissed at you.
I don't trust you.

1064
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:46,917
You put my tit in the ringer
on that goddamn dope beef.

1065
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:49,086
I love you, all right?
I just don't trust you.

1066
01:17:49,711 --> 01:17:52,297
- That's how it started with Paul.
- What started with Paul?

1067
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,550
DiB's talkin' subversive,
and Sammy's right next to him.

1068
01:17:54,132 --> 01:17:57,386
DiB is solid,
and so is Sammy.

1069
01:17:56,844 --> 01:18:00,764
Put out the fucking cigarettes
and see a doctor.

1070
01:18:00,055 --> 01:18:02,474
Come on. Stop that.

1071
01:18:11,859 --> 01:18:13,485
Where is everybody?

1072
01:18:13,193 --> 01:18:15,612
I think Gene's at Sheepshead Bay
with your mother.

1073
01:18:15,195 --> 01:18:19,157
Pete's downtown lookin' at a buyer
who wants to talk to you about buyin'.

1074
01:18:18,448 --> 01:18:21,577
- That son of a bitch...
- I really don't wanna know.

1075
01:18:21,034 --> 01:18:23,370
It's just an expression.

1076
01:18:23,996 --> 01:18:26,081
So, consigliere...

1077
01:18:26,999 --> 01:18:32,045
Angie says DiB is talkin' subversive.
There's nothin' to that, right?

1078
01:18:33,589 --> 01:18:35,257
DiB's a solid guy.

1079
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:38,135
Between us,
Angie's just a little jealous...

1080
01:18:37,551 --> 01:18:40,929
that me and Sammy got the slots
we did after Paulie went.

1081
01:18:40,345 --> 01:18:44,183
They don't like you spending
so much time with DiB.

1082
01:18:43,473 --> 01:18:47,144
Forget about it, Johnny.
Normal family bullshit.

1083
01:18:47,477 --> 01:18:49,479
Where is Sammy today?

1084
01:18:49,146 --> 01:18:51,815
He's working. Hey.

1085
01:18:51,356 --> 01:18:53,859
You know the guy got
a $13 million contract...

1086
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:56,528
to build a new school
in Brighton Beach?

1087
01:18:55,986 --> 01:18:58,614
This guy's a wonder.
He opens a business a minute.

1088
01:18:58,155 --> 01:19:01,283
Since you made him underboss,
nobody can keep up with him.

1089
01:19:00,741 --> 01:19:03,660
In a few years,
between him and DiB...

1090
01:19:03,118 --> 01:19:05,662
they're gonna own
all of Brooklyn.

1091
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:09,833
This guy, O'Connor,
head of the 608 Union?

1092
01:19:09,333 --> 01:19:12,753
He trashed the place
'cause Tommy didn't use his people.

1093
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:15,255
They definitely knew
they was under your flag.

1094
01:19:14,713 --> 01:19:17,508
I was ready to whack the guy...

1095
01:19:17,007 --> 01:19:19,510
but I mentioned it to DiB.

1096
01:19:19,092 --> 01:19:21,720
He said I ought
to run it by you.

1097
01:19:21,261 --> 01:19:25,724
What is this? You and DiB discuss
who gets whacked and who don't?

1098
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:27,851
Who the fuck is the boss,
may I ask?

1099
01:19:27,309 --> 01:19:30,437
We weren't discussin' anything.

1100
01:19:29,895 --> 01:19:33,315
I mentioned it to DiB in passing.
He waved the flag.

1101
01:19:32,689 --> 01:19:36,902
- It ain't no big fuckin' deal.
- I hear he's promotin' you for boss.

1102
01:19:36,151 --> 01:19:38,695
I don't think he was
talkin' out of turn.

1103
01:19:38,237 --> 01:19:40,697
- DiB was thinkin' of the family.
- He's thinking.

1104
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,950
He got no right to think it.

1105
01:19:42,491 --> 01:19:44,993
I just spent half a million
on legal fees.

1106
01:19:44,576 --> 01:19:47,079
I'm sitting on the griddle
for seven fuckin' months.

1107
01:19:46,662 --> 01:19:49,915
I got you and DiB layin' me down.
What kind of friend is that?

1108
01:19:49,373 --> 01:19:52,251
Get the fuck outta here,
layin' you down.

1109
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:54,378
What are you talkin' about?

1110
01:19:53,961 --> 01:19:56,421
What's the matter with you?

1111
01:19:56,004 --> 01:20:00,342
I'm in a courtroom for seven months.
Now I got Gene and Angie's drug trial.

1112
01:19:59,591 --> 01:20:04,137
Then the FBI pops up in the men's room
every time I take a piss.

1113
01:20:03,345 --> 01:20:07,224
I'm talkin' about my blood pressure!
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1114
01:20:06,515 --> 01:20:09,434
- Forget I said anything.
- You got it.

1115
01:20:12,855 --> 01:20:15,566
You really worried about this thing?

1116
01:20:15,065 --> 01:20:20,487
I mean, you want me
to keep an eye on DiB or what?

1117
01:20:23,073 --> 01:20:24,741
Yeah.

1118
01:20:25,742 --> 01:20:28,453
Keep an eye on him.

1119
01:20:29,079 --> 01:20:30,664
Come here.

1120
01:20:31,582 --> 01:20:33,792
Take care of yourself.

1121
01:20:33,417 --> 01:20:37,087
I'm worried about your blood pressure.
Don't be eatin' all that greasy shit.

1122
01:20:46,138 --> 01:20:48,974
Seven fuckin' months.

1123
01:20:48,473 --> 01:20:51,727
Seven fuckin' months
that RICO case had me tied up.

1124
01:20:51,143 --> 01:20:54,354
- They don't let you live.
- Seven months of my life.

1125
01:20:53,770 --> 01:20:56,273
I know.
They don't let you live.

1126
01:20:55,856 --> 01:20:58,692
Speaking of time,
we got that 3 o'clock in midtown.

1127
01:20:58,192 --> 01:21:00,611
- What time is it now?
- Time to go.

1128
01:21:00,194 --> 01:21:03,822
Tell 'em I can't break away.
I'm staying. I'll ride back with Sammy.

1129
01:21:03,155 --> 01:21:05,449
You goin' into Manhattan?
Good.

1130
01:21:05,073 --> 01:21:07,826
- See you later.
- We'll do it tomorrow.

1131
01:21:07,326 --> 01:21:10,287
Jimmy, thanks for everything.
Put it on Sammy's tab.

1132
01:21:09,786 --> 01:21:12,414
Sure. Ciao.

1133
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:18,086
So, Cheech, you wanna drop me off
at Mulberry Street?

1134
01:21:17,503 --> 01:21:20,005
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's go.

1135
01:21:20,714 --> 01:21:24,092
You wanna talk about Fourth Avenue
or whatever the fuck it was?

1136
01:21:23,467 --> 01:21:24,718
What Fourth Avenue?

1137
01:21:26,637 --> 01:21:28,222
Fuckin' Buick.

1138
01:21:55,207 --> 01:21:57,543
Who's not here?
Is anybody missing?

1139
01:21:57,125 --> 01:22:00,170
- Tommy Marino ain't here!
- He's in Florida!

1140
01:21:59,628 --> 01:22:02,548
I don't see DiB.
DiB ain't here!

1141
01:22:04,716 --> 01:22:06,677
DiB ain't here.

1142
01:22:10,556 --> 01:22:13,016
I know you come from upstate,
Connecticut, Jersey.

1143
01:22:12,599 --> 01:22:17,145
I'm not gonna keep youse here.
I heard some of youse talkin'.

1144
01:22:16,311 --> 01:22:19,731
Nobody knows
who killed Frankie DeCicco.

1145
01:22:19,106 --> 01:22:20,899
So don't ask.

1146
01:22:20,607 --> 01:22:26,071
Nobody's got to look over their
shoulder. Tell your crews to stay calm.

1147
01:22:27,197 --> 01:22:29,741
You're the Gambino family.

1148
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:34,746
And don't you ever
fuckin' believe...

1149
01:22:33,996 --> 01:22:35,956
that anyone...

1150
01:22:35,622 --> 01:22:39,001
anyone anywhere...

1151
01:22:40,419 --> 01:22:42,921
is gonna fuck with us.

1152
01:22:45,966 --> 01:22:48,677
Now, go home
and drive carefully.

1153
01:22:48,218 --> 01:22:51,847
Believe me, that's the most
dangerous part of your lives.

1154
01:22:54,516 --> 01:22:57,144
Thank you for bein' here.

1155
01:23:15,913 --> 01:23:20,626
Man, that car.
You oughta see that fuckin' car.

1156
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:22,961
This just could be
a renegade element, that's all.

1157
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:24,880
Maybe it's one
of Tommy Bilotti's people.

1158
01:23:24,463 --> 01:23:29,468
Hey, Frankie DeCicco
set up the meeting with Big Paul.

1159
01:23:28,509 --> 01:23:30,928
Payback time.

1160
01:23:30,511 --> 01:23:33,138
Yeah, but the question is,
is it over?

1161
01:23:34,515 --> 01:23:37,351
There was nothin' left
of that fuckin' car.

1162
01:23:44,858 --> 01:23:47,319
- How are you, Joe?
- I'm good.

1163
01:23:46,902 --> 01:23:48,362
Good.

1164
01:23:48,195 --> 01:23:50,197
Jordan, espresso.

1165
01:23:52,491 --> 01:23:56,787
For sure you were supposed to be
in that car with Frankie.

1166
01:23:55,994 --> 01:23:57,246
We goin' to war?

1167
01:23:57,829 --> 01:23:59,623
They took their shot.

1168
01:23:59,331 --> 01:24:03,752
They'll be satisfied with one for one
and give you a pass.

1169
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,546
But you got
even bigger problems.

1170
01:24:05,128 --> 01:24:10,467
Yeah? You sellin' the special here,
or you tellin' fortunes today?

1171
01:24:09,466 --> 01:24:12,928
Don't take no fortune-teller
to see where you're headin'.

1172
01:24:12,302 --> 01:24:15,639
I went to your inauguration.

1173
01:24:15,055 --> 01:24:17,474
I held my nose, but I went.

1174
01:24:17,057 --> 01:24:21,019
What did you have to hold
your nose about? I'm just curious.

1175
01:24:20,269 --> 01:24:22,437
I got every right
to talk this way.

1176
01:24:23,105 --> 01:24:27,818
I was at the sit-down
with Neil and Paul and Don Carlo...

1177
01:24:26,942 --> 01:24:29,444
after you clipped Galione.

1178
01:24:29,027 --> 01:24:33,532
You broke a rule then,
but Neil got you a pass.

1179
01:24:32,698 --> 01:24:36,785
Then you broke another rule. You whacked
out a boss without a Commission okay.

1180
01:24:36,034 --> 01:24:37,286
Excuse me.

1181
01:24:37,077 --> 01:24:40,038
I'm supposed to get
a Commission okay...

1182
01:24:39,538 --> 01:24:42,082
while my family
is being bled to death?

1183
01:24:41,623 --> 01:24:44,126
Hey, fuck Paul.
He deserved it.

1184
01:24:43,709 --> 01:24:46,712
That's got nothing
to do with it.

1185
01:24:47,171 --> 01:24:49,756
The rules are for everybody.

1186
01:24:49,298 --> 01:24:53,594
Right now, on a street in Brooklyn,
there's a young kid.

1187
01:24:52,801 --> 01:24:56,805
He works himself up, and he talks
to DiB, he talks to Gravano...

1188
01:24:56,096 --> 01:25:00,142
he talks to three or four capos,
and you get a bullet in your head.

1189
01:25:01,602 --> 01:25:05,063
We survive by our rules.

1190
01:25:04,438 --> 01:25:07,733
And now you're breakin'
the oldest rule of all.

1191
01:25:07,149 --> 01:25:09,776
You're goin' fuckin' public.

1192
01:25:09,318 --> 01:25:11,153
On TV and magazine covers.

1193
01:25:10,819 --> 01:25:13,322
These fancy suits,
these fancy haircuts.

1194
01:25:12,905 --> 01:25:14,448
"John Gotti, John Gotti."

1195
01:25:14,198 --> 01:25:17,242
Don't give me that shit.
I didn't ask to go public.

1196
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:19,244
They shove their cameras
and microphones in my face.

1197
01:25:18,827 --> 01:25:20,829
Get the fuck outta here.

1198
01:25:20,495 --> 01:25:23,040
You're turning this thing of ours
into entertainment...

1199
01:25:22,581 --> 01:25:25,459
for everyone who watches
the six o'clock news.

1200
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:27,461
But our thing is secret.

1201
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:32,674
Secret.
And what you're doin' won't work.

1202
01:25:33,258 --> 01:25:35,802
You believe you can keep spitting
in the government's face...

1203
01:25:35,344 --> 01:25:37,262
and get away with it?

1204
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:39,890
You're making them
come after you.

1205
01:25:39,348 --> 01:25:42,351
What do you think, Joe?

1206
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:44,478
You don't think the FBI
knows who you are?

1207
01:25:45,354 --> 01:25:48,148
Your face hasn't been
on the wall next to mine...

1208
01:25:47,689 --> 01:25:49,858
for the last 20 years?

1209
01:25:49,525 --> 01:25:52,736
Get outta here.
They know me. I know who I am.

1210
01:25:52,194 --> 01:25:54,613
I'm not embarrassed by who I am.

1211
01:25:54,196 --> 01:25:57,574
I'm not gonna sit in the dark
like some fuckin' rat.

1212
01:25:56,990 --> 01:26:00,202
In the end, maybe I'll get respect.
I'm not gettin' any here.

1213
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:03,372
John, you made
a hell of a long walk...

1214
01:26:02,704 --> 01:26:06,708
from a cockroach tenement
to the cover of Time magazine.

1215
01:26:05,999 --> 01:26:07,793
That takes ability.

1216
01:26:08,418 --> 01:26:12,965
But a Cosa Nostra boss don't belong
on the cover of Time magazine.

1217
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:14,550
Wherever I'm at,
it's 'cause I am who I am.

1218
01:26:14,132 --> 01:26:17,135
I'm not gonna change
or apologize for who I am.

1219
01:26:16,593 --> 01:26:19,263
But you'll wind up in a cell...

1220
01:26:18,804 --> 01:26:21,306
because you are who you are.

1221
01:26:22,391 --> 01:26:25,102
And you'll take
a lot of good people with you.

1222
01:26:26,812 --> 01:26:31,316
Duck, John.
Learn to duck sometimes.

1223
01:26:30,482 --> 01:26:33,902
No more comments
about me lowering myprofile.

1224
01:26:33,277 --> 01:26:35,404
It's not my style.

1225
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:38,073
We're not gonna be
this styleless family.

1226
01:26:37,531 --> 01:26:40,868
First order of business,
new consigliere.

1227
01:26:40,284 --> 01:26:42,703
Frankie, the job is yours.

1228
01:26:42,286 --> 01:26:44,830
You get word
to the four bosses today.

1229
01:26:44,371 --> 01:26:46,999
If DeCicco was payment in full,
we settle.

1230
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:49,042
- We all want to get on with our lives.
- It's done.

1231
01:26:48,625 --> 01:26:51,962
Gene, you got a drug trial comin' up.
Stay off the street.

1232
01:26:51,336 --> 01:26:53,505
- Let Pete run Queens.
- You got it.

1233
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:55,215
What's my job?

1234
01:26:54,882 --> 01:26:58,051
Killin' people. What else?
You been buggin' me.

1235
01:26:57,467 --> 01:27:00,971
You want to clip Lou DiBono
and Mickey whatever-his-name-is?

1236
01:27:00,345 --> 01:27:02,181
- Mickey De Batt.
- Fine.

1237
01:27:01,889 --> 01:27:04,766
Clip 'em both,
makes you feel good.

1238
01:27:04,266 --> 01:27:05,851
All right.

1239
01:27:07,394 --> 01:27:11,857
Look, I hate to bring this up
'cause I'm really close to the guy...

1240
01:27:12,149 --> 01:27:14,860
but I got an obligation
to the family here.

1241
01:27:20,657 --> 01:27:24,912
Maybe Angelo ain't so crazy when he said
DiB's been doin' a lot of talkin'.

1242
01:27:24,161 --> 01:27:26,663
Whoa. Wait a minute.

1243
01:27:26,205 --> 01:27:29,541
Angelo's been sipping morphine
for months for his cancer.

1244
01:27:28,957 --> 01:27:32,169
The guy's in and out. You can't
believe him on something like this.

1245
01:27:31,585 --> 01:27:34,880
It isn't just
what Angelo said.

1246
01:27:34,296 --> 01:27:36,924
DiB's got his own agenda.

1247
01:27:36,507 --> 01:27:40,594
Where was he last night?
John almost got killed.

1248
01:27:39,885 --> 01:27:42,930
It's like a spit in the face,
not showin' up.

1249
01:27:42,387 --> 01:27:45,182
- You know where he was?
- I know where he was.

1250
01:27:44,723 --> 01:27:47,643
DiB was in Brooklyn
on union business.

1251
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:49,645
It was bona fide.
I checked it out today.

1252
01:27:49,228 --> 01:27:52,814
DiB told me he told you that
and that you were to tell John.

1253
01:27:53,607 --> 01:27:58,529
- He never told me anything.
- DiB's no threat, for chrissakes!

1254
01:27:57,611 --> 01:28:00,572
Even if he said something,
it don't mean shit.

1255
01:28:00,072 --> 01:28:01,907
Fuck it!

1256
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:09,081
See, I got no time.

1257
01:28:09,373 --> 01:28:13,085
I got no time for subversives.
Not now!

1258
01:28:12,417 --> 01:28:14,127
Not now.

1259
01:28:14,628 --> 01:28:18,423
I love DiB as much
as any man in this room...

1260
01:28:19,007 --> 01:28:21,009
but if he's backdoor in' John...

1261
01:28:23,095 --> 01:28:24,930
It's DiB!

1262
01:28:24,638 --> 01:28:26,390
Come on in!

1263
01:28:29,059 --> 01:28:32,980
John, I'm sorry I'm late.
Just wanted you to know I was here.

1264
01:28:32,271 --> 01:28:35,440
You want me in on this,
or you want me downstairs?

1265
01:28:34,857 --> 01:28:36,650
No, downstairs is all right.

1266
01:28:36,358 --> 01:28:38,861
All right.
See you later.

1267
01:28:47,369 --> 01:28:50,455
I don't want the world to think
I'm in hiding.

1268
01:28:52,249 --> 01:28:54,751
You comin' bouncin', Sammy?

1269
01:28:54,293 --> 01:28:57,004
Not tonight, Johnny.

1270
01:28:56,545 --> 01:28:58,755
I'll take DiB.

1271
01:28:59,965 --> 01:29:01,842
What a life, huh?

1272
01:29:02,759 --> 01:29:05,804
Pallin' around with a guy
I'm gonna have clipped.

1273
01:29:13,854 --> 01:29:16,398
That little list
of guys who go...

1274
01:29:15,939 --> 01:29:18,817
Louie DiBono
has two businesses with Sammy.

1275
01:29:18,317 --> 01:29:20,819
Mickey De Batt
is in demolition with Sammy.

1276
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:24,239
Yeah, and DiB and Sammy got
over a dozen businesses together.

1277
01:29:33,999 --> 01:29:36,877
Bruce, come here.

1278
01:29:36,376 --> 01:29:37,920
What?

1279
01:29:40,214 --> 01:29:42,049
Check this out.

1280
01:29:46,553 --> 01:29:49,264
Why are these capos
showing her all this respect?

1281
01:29:48,805 --> 01:29:51,600
That's a good question.

1282
01:29:51,099 --> 01:29:54,645
- Does she live in the building?
- I don't know.

1283
01:29:55,479 --> 01:29:59,525
I'm not in this thing out
of the goodness of my heart.

1284
01:29:58,774 --> 01:30:01,735
I'm in this thing to make money.

1285
01:30:01,235 --> 01:30:03,070
Come on in.

1286
01:30:08,408 --> 01:30:11,119
Hey, Joe,
get DiB an espresso.

1287
01:30:11,578 --> 01:30:13,997
All right.
Don't worry about it.

1288
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:16,208
Yeah. Whatever.

1289
01:30:15,749 --> 01:30:19,086
All right, we'll straighten it out
tomorrow, all right?

1290
01:30:19,628 --> 01:30:22,548
Subcontractor from that school
out in Queens.

1291
01:30:22,047 --> 01:30:25,008
Looks like we got a little
$30,000 envelope coming.

1292
01:30:24,466 --> 01:30:26,927
Good.
Could use the money.

1293
01:30:26,510 --> 01:30:28,887
With your fuckin' habits.

1294
01:30:30,806 --> 01:30:33,725
- Here you go. Two sugars.
- Thank you.

1295
01:30:34,852 --> 01:30:36,854
Cheers.

1296
01:30:47,322 --> 01:30:50,033
Thought you weren't gonna come.

1297
01:30:49,575 --> 01:30:52,077
- I wasn't.
- Fuck you.

1298
01:30:52,828 --> 01:30:55,247
- Hey, John.
- What?

1299
01:30:55,831 --> 01:30:58,417
Things are different now.

1300
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,294
Yeah? What's different?

1301
01:30:59,877 --> 01:31:01,795
Look at me.

1302
01:31:04,047 --> 01:31:06,550
- I fucked up.
- So?

1303
01:31:07,176 --> 01:31:09,595
You're a fuck-up, yeah?

1304
01:31:10,554 --> 01:31:13,056
You still mad at me?

1305
01:31:13,849 --> 01:31:15,684
You still mad at me?

1306
01:31:18,187 --> 01:31:19,396
I'm thinkin'.

1307
01:31:25,152 --> 01:31:26,695
That's good.

1308
01:31:28,155 --> 01:31:30,616
- Hey, John.
- What?

1309
01:31:34,369 --> 01:31:35,787
I'm sorry.

1310
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:41,960
Just shut up and eat, all right?

1311
01:31:47,466 --> 01:31:52,679
Mrs. Michael Cirelli, apartment 10
in Gotti's building. Lives alone.

1312
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:55,015
Widow of Mikey Cirelli.

1313
01:31:56,433 --> 01:31:59,353
Lifelong soldier
for Neil Dellacroce.

1314
01:32:45,649 --> 01:32:49,111
So what?
So it's another RICO case.

1315
01:32:48,485 --> 01:32:53,407
What am I supposed to say? These Feds
got nothin' better to do than chase me?

1316
01:32:52,489 --> 01:32:56,118
I'm the only game in town now?
We'll sue them.

1317
01:32:55,450 --> 01:32:58,412
For harassment.
What the hell else?

1318
01:32:57,870 --> 01:33:00,956
It's 2:45 in the morning.
Am I getting billed for this?

1319
01:33:00,414 --> 01:33:02,833
Then let's say nothin',
all right?

1320
01:33:08,046 --> 01:33:10,215
What is it?

1321
01:33:11,633 --> 01:33:14,052
They got a new grand jury
goin' now.

1322
01:33:14,511 --> 01:33:17,848
- Jesus, Johnny.
- Fuckin' government.

1323
01:33:18,724 --> 01:33:21,810
Like a 1,000-pound gorilla.

1324
01:33:21,268 --> 01:33:23,145
You beat 'em before.

1325
01:33:25,063 --> 01:33:26,315
Beat 'em again.

1326
01:33:29,776 --> 01:33:31,653
Come to bed.

1327
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:34,531
Let me look at my races.

1328
01:33:46,418 --> 01:33:48,921
So who do we got today?

1329
01:33:55,344 --> 01:33:58,055
We got my lucky baby,
my lucky star.

1330
01:33:59,890 --> 01:34:02,559
Susan Valley,
Eddie's Delight.

1331
01:34:06,605 --> 01:34:08,690
What looks good?

1332
01:34:10,692 --> 01:34:12,361
What looks good?

1333
01:34:25,666 --> 01:34:27,042
He's here.

1334
01:34:27,668 --> 01:34:29,545
With his lawyer.

1335
01:34:39,012 --> 01:34:40,806
Where are we?

1336
01:34:40,514 --> 01:34:44,309
They're coming down with 15, 20 counts
of RICO, including the Castellano hit.

1337
01:34:43,642 --> 01:34:46,270
- This is serious.
- What is this gonna cost?

1338
01:34:45,811 --> 01:34:47,855
Forget that.

1339
01:34:47,521 --> 01:34:52,401
It's their last shot.
If we win again, we're out of the woods.

1340
01:34:51,483 --> 01:34:53,986
But if they come up
with something strong...

1341
01:34:53,527 --> 01:34:57,447
we might have to think about
striking a deal with the prosecutor.

1342
01:34:57,823 --> 01:35:00,409
- What are you talkin' about?
- Listen to me.

1343
01:35:01,493 --> 01:35:03,996
Who you talkin' to here?

1344
01:35:06,373 --> 01:35:08,625
No, no.

1345
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:13,714
You don't let anyone
in this family cop any kind of a plea.

1346
01:35:12,713 --> 01:35:16,133
A plea bargain
is just another gun...

1347
01:35:15,549 --> 01:35:18,385
Am I talkin' to myself?
I said no fuckin' deals.

1348
01:35:17,885 --> 01:35:21,722
I don't give a shit if everyone here
goes to Marion for a thousand years.

1349
01:35:21,054 --> 01:35:23,515
There's gonna be
no fuckin' deals!

1350
01:35:23,098 --> 01:35:24,641
No fuckin' deals!

1351
01:35:27,352 --> 01:35:31,023
I'll get Jacoby and Meyers
to plea bargain my ass.

1352
01:35:32,566 --> 01:35:34,818
Cost me eight cents.

1353
01:35:51,126 --> 01:35:54,963
We got the place to ourselves.
The old lady's with her nephew.

1354
01:35:54,254 --> 01:35:59,051
I just told Cutler
no one is taking that stand.

1355
01:35:58,175 --> 01:36:00,677
You get my cell ready right now.

1356
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:03,722
'Cause if it ain't malicious mopery
or car theft, we deny everything.

1357
01:36:03,096 --> 01:36:06,016
Cutler told me they come up
with a new statute.

1358
01:36:05,474 --> 01:36:09,478
It's called "committing murder
in furtherance of your position."

1359
01:36:08,769 --> 01:36:11,688
That's nice.
That's real nice.

1360
01:36:11,146 --> 01:36:14,441
They come up with anything they want.
Fuckin' government.

1361
01:36:15,067 --> 01:36:18,445
That dunce Bush.
Yeah, old Bush.

1362
01:36:17,819 --> 01:36:21,448
He could send a whole army
to Panama to grab one man... the spic.

1363
01:36:20,822 --> 01:36:22,241
Yeah, Noriega.

1364
01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:25,160
You know how many people
they whacked out to get that fuck?

1365
01:36:24,618 --> 01:36:30,415
The spic's workin' for Washington
the whole time. They got no parameters.

1366
01:36:30,916 --> 01:36:33,085
What time is it, anyway?

1367
01:36:32,709 --> 01:36:35,420
- About 11:30.
- Where's Sammy?

1368
01:36:34,962 --> 01:36:37,464
I guess he's home.
He's tired.

1369
01:36:38,298 --> 01:36:41,969
Tired of being the world's only
pussy-whipped hit man.

1370
01:36:42,928 --> 01:36:45,639
Tired 'cause he got
40 fuckin' companies now.

1371
01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:48,058
The guy's creating capital.

1372
01:36:47,516 --> 01:36:50,561
For you? For me?
No shit? For the family?

1373
01:36:50,018 --> 01:36:52,604
I got people
in the carpet business.

1374
01:36:52,187 --> 01:36:56,567
They come to be every day. They say,
"John, we can't even get a job.

1375
01:36:55,732 --> 01:36:58,861
Sammy's locking up everything.
We can't even turn a buck."

1376
01:36:58,318 --> 01:37:01,238
I go to Sammy with that.
You know what he says?

1377
01:37:00,737 --> 01:37:03,156
"I'll whack the cocksuckers.
Then they won't beef."

1378
01:37:02,739 --> 01:37:05,576
What kind of attitude is that?

1379
01:37:05,117 --> 01:37:09,162
He does it under my flag.
He uses my name.

1380
01:37:08,453 --> 01:37:09,997
You gotta understand.

1381
01:37:09,788 --> 01:37:14,126
Sammy brings in 100,000 in cash
every month.

1382
01:37:13,375 --> 01:37:17,754
I say stick it up his ass.
I'd rather die broke.

1383
01:37:16,962 --> 01:37:20,799
Then what? Bleed my family
to death? We been through this!

1384
01:37:20,132 --> 01:37:21,341
It aggravates me.

1385
01:37:21,216 --> 01:37:23,093
It aggravates me!

1386
01:37:22,801 --> 01:37:27,055
I can be a billionaire, if I wanna
be a greedy boss. It ain 't right.

1387
01:37:26,263 --> 01:37:28,348
That ain 't right.
When does it stop?

1388
01:37:28,015 --> 01:37:30,809
How much is enough?
How much could Sammy want?

1389
01:37:30,309 --> 01:37:31,518
If not for his greed...

1390
01:37:31,393 --> 01:37:33,061
you gotta love the guy.

1391
01:37:32,769 --> 01:37:33,979
The guy is down.

1392
01:37:33,854 --> 01:37:36,982
What the fuck is this, Rome?

1393
01:37:37,774 --> 01:37:40,235
What is this?
"All roads lead to Sammy"?

1394
01:37:40,444 --> 01:37:43,864
I agree.
Sammy's gotta pull it in.

1395
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:45,908
I gotta ask you something.

1396
01:37:47,534 --> 01:37:51,747
- Did you ever hear DiB talk subversive?
- Never.

1397
01:37:50,954 --> 01:37:55,751
Who took over DiB's
construction unions? Who?

1398
01:37:58,879 --> 01:38:00,672
Fuckin' Sammy.

1399
01:38:02,591 --> 01:38:04,468
It's makin' me sick.

1400
01:38:06,470 --> 01:38:08,972
It's makin' me physically sick.

1401
01:38:09,890 --> 01:38:12,434
I love that guy.

1402
01:38:11,975 --> 01:38:14,520
What am I gonna do?
Whack him?

1403
01:38:14,102 --> 01:38:16,605
I tell him a million times.

1404
01:38:16,146 --> 01:38:18,398
"Will you slow it down?

1405
01:38:18,023 --> 01:38:21,568
You don't have to wind up with every
dime on the plate. Spread some cheer."

1406
01:38:20,943 --> 01:38:22,611
What am I talkin' about?

1407
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:25,489
The guy whacked out Louie Malito,
Louie DiBono, Mickey De Batt and DiB.

1408
01:38:24,947 --> 01:38:28,158
They're all in business with Sammy.

1409
01:38:27,574 --> 01:38:29,993
And DiB...

1410
01:38:30,869 --> 01:38:34,039
What the fuck did we do,
Frankie?

1411
01:38:33,497 --> 01:38:35,457
The guy was a gentleman.

1412
01:38:35,123 --> 01:38:38,210
Who clipped him?
Who did the work?

1413
01:38:37,668 --> 01:38:40,295
Who did the work?

1414
01:38:44,174 --> 01:38:45,425
Fuck it.

1415
01:38:46,677 --> 01:38:48,095
Fuck it.

1416
01:38:49,304 --> 01:38:52,766
I'll tell you something else.
You want a real circus?

1417
01:38:52,182 --> 01:38:55,477
You set it up for Sammy
to grab everything off the plate.

1418
01:38:54,893 --> 01:38:57,855
Him and the lawyers.
You know what you got?

1419
01:38:57,354 --> 01:39:01,066
You got the Cutler, Shargel
and Fuckstein crime family.

1420
01:39:00,399 --> 01:39:02,860
That fuck. And Cutler...

1421
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:05,779
he tells me about Marion.

1422
01:39:06,196 --> 01:39:09,283
Twenty-three and a half hours
lockdown.

1423
01:39:09,908 --> 01:39:12,119
One phone call a night.

1424
01:39:12,744 --> 01:39:15,372
Enough food to keep you alive
in an 8-by-7 cage...

1425
01:39:14,955 --> 01:39:17,583
and no one on
the goddamn cell block.

1426
01:39:17,165 --> 01:39:21,545
I say, "Fuck 'em! I'll die in a cage,
and I'll out live the motherfuckers."

1427
01:39:20,752 --> 01:39:24,131
I'm not leaving some kind
of a goddamn circus here.

1428
01:39:24,214 --> 01:39:27,676
You hungry?
Let's go get some pizza.

1429
01:39:27,050 --> 01:39:29,678
Fuckin' starvin'.
Let's get outta here.

1430
01:39:29,219 --> 01:39:31,972
We ain't comin' back, neither.

1431
01:39:31,513 --> 01:39:35,851
I put a hundred in.
What you want from me?

1432
01:39:35,058 --> 01:39:37,561
- A ten. Gimme that.
- Fuckin' ten.

1433
01:39:37,102 --> 01:39:39,521
Come on.
We're just starting here.

1434
01:39:39,104 --> 01:39:41,481
Go ahead.

1435
01:39:41,106 --> 01:39:44,735
- Come on.
- Just play the fuckin' game.

1436
01:39:44,067 --> 01:39:46,111
- A three.
- Three of diamonds.

1437
01:39:46,612 --> 01:39:49,281
- Gimme a card!
- Straight. Look at that.

1438
01:39:54,703 --> 01:39:55,954
Okay, let's go!

1439
01:39:57,539 --> 01:40:00,209
The three of you
go around the back.

1440
01:40:08,175 --> 01:40:11,303
We're here to arrest
Frankie LoCascio...

1441
01:40:10,761 --> 01:40:13,597
Sam Gravano and John Gotti.

1442
01:40:15,641 --> 01:40:19,269
I want everyone else to do themselves
a favor and stay put.

1443
01:40:18,644 --> 01:40:20,854
I'll tell you
when you can leave.

1444
01:40:22,439 --> 01:40:25,776
- Get outta here.
- What's Gotti being arrested for?

1445
01:40:41,375 --> 01:40:43,836
Did you ever hear
DiB talk subversive?

1446
01:40:46,171 --> 01:40:47,881
Never.

1447
01:40:49,299 --> 01:40:51,927
Who took over
DiB's construction unions?

1448
01:40:54,179 --> 01:40:55,889
Fuckin' Sammy.

1449
01:40:57,015 --> 01:41:00,227
That makes me sick,
'cause I love the guy.

1450
01:41:00,686 --> 01:41:05,274
I love the guy. And what
am I gonna do? Whack him?

1451
01:41:04,398 --> 01:41:07,985
I tell him a million times,
"Will you slow it down?

1452
01:41:07,359 --> 01:41:11,947
You don't have to windup with every
dime on the plate. Spread some cheer."

1453
01:41:11,071 --> 01:41:14,157
What am I talkin' about?
The guy whacked out Louie Malito...

1454
01:41:13,657 --> 01:41:15,450
Louie DiBono,
Mickey De Batt and DiB!

1455
01:41:15,158 --> 01:41:17,995
DiB! They're in business
with the guy.

1456
01:41:17,494 --> 01:41:23,458
And DiB... The guy, he was
a gentleman, for chrissakes.

1457
01:41:22,332 --> 01:41:26,670
- Who clipped him? Who did the work?
- Fuckin'Sammy.

1458
01:41:25,878 --> 01:41:27,921
Fuckin'Sammy.

1459
01:41:28,380 --> 01:41:31,425
- It's making me sick.
- I've heard enough.

1460
01:41:35,053 --> 01:41:37,764
Defendants shall be held
without bail.

1461
01:41:37,264 --> 01:41:40,267
I'm also granting
the government's motion...

1462
01:41:39,766 --> 01:41:42,769
to disqualify
present defense counsel.

1463
01:41:42,227 --> 01:41:45,355
Cutler, Shargel and Pollok
have to be disqualified...

1464
01:41:44,771 --> 01:41:49,443
because their role as house counsel
was discussed in taped conversations...

1465
01:41:48,609 --> 01:41:55,032
that the prosecution may use
as evidence in this trial.

1466
01:41:53,822 --> 01:41:59,411
Beyond that, there are also
conflict of interest issues...

1467
01:41:58,327 --> 01:42:01,997
because of prior representation
of potential witnesses.

1468
01:42:01,330 --> 01:42:06,251
Therefore, the lawyers could be called
as witnesses in this trial.

1469
01:42:05,334 --> 01:42:09,004
The defendants are advised
to appear before me at...

1470
01:42:10,005 --> 01:42:14,551
9:30 a.m., Monday the 23rd,
with new counsel.

1471
01:42:13,717 --> 01:42:15,177
Court is adjourned.

1472
01:42:39,868 --> 01:42:43,038
We're gonna have to release them
into the prison population.

1473
01:42:42,496 --> 01:42:45,707
The judge ruled that keeping them
in isolation is punitive.

1474
01:42:45,165 --> 01:42:50,796
Okay. So tell the warden
to put Gravano in with Gotti.

1475
01:42:51,213 --> 01:42:52,881
What about LoCascio?

1476
01:42:52,589 --> 01:42:55,050
Doesn't matter.
Put him anywhere.

1477
01:42:54,675 --> 01:42:56,593
Sammy's the key.

1478
01:43:07,688 --> 01:43:09,857
What do you say, Sammy?

1479
01:43:16,321 --> 01:43:18,866
How could you say
those things about me, John?

1480
01:43:18,448 --> 01:43:21,410
Tapes are tapes, man.
Don't mean nothing.

1481
01:43:20,868 --> 01:43:24,955
I'm talkin', right?
I can fuckin' talk, can't I?

1482
01:43:24,204 --> 01:43:25,956
Yeah, some fuckin' talk.

1483
01:43:25,664 --> 01:43:28,125
You backdoored me...

1484
01:43:27,708 --> 01:43:31,461
while I was your underboss
and I was whackin' guys for you.

1485
01:43:30,794 --> 01:43:36,091
Hey. Get the fuck outta here
with that shit right now.

1486
01:43:35,090 --> 01:43:37,885
You're the one who gets off
whackin' people out, not me.

1487
01:43:37,384 --> 01:43:41,471
You come cryin' to me about DiBono...
your partner for years, not mine.

1488
01:43:40,721 --> 01:43:43,473
I don't know the man.

1489
01:43:42,973 --> 01:43:45,809
You wanted to whack him.
I said, "Do what you want."

1490
01:43:45,309 --> 01:43:48,270
Same with Louie Malito.

1491
01:43:47,769 --> 01:43:52,232
The same with Scibetta...
your own brother-in-law, for chrissakes.

1492
01:43:51,398 --> 01:43:54,443
What am I talkin' about?
What about Tommy Spinelli?

1493
01:43:53,901 --> 01:43:58,030
Eddie Garafalo?
Mickey whatever-the-fuck-his name was.

1494
01:43:57,279 --> 01:44:02,826
Worst of all, DiB. You come into a ton
of fuckin' money when DiB went.

1495
01:44:01,783 --> 01:44:04,870
Ton of fuckin' money.
Don't ever deny that.

1496
01:44:04,328 --> 01:44:08,207
- Don't you ever fuckin' deny that.
- Let's not rewrite history here.

1497
01:44:07,497 --> 01:44:09,917
I didn't mind DiB goin'.

1498
01:44:09,499 --> 01:44:12,419
Fuckin' playboy
instead of a business partner.

1499
01:44:11,877 --> 01:44:15,756
But you wanted it, and when John Gotti
wanted somebody in the ground...

1500
01:44:15,047 --> 01:44:17,674
John Gotti called Sammy Gravano.

1501
01:44:17,216 --> 01:44:20,010
- You barked, I bit, remember?
- "You bit"?

1502
01:44:19,510 --> 01:44:23,388
You pillage this city under my flag,
usin' my name. My name!

1503
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:27,142
You're a selfish prick.

1504
01:44:28,185 --> 01:44:31,313
You're greedy
is your fuckin' problem.

1505
01:44:30,812 --> 01:44:32,773
This is all my fault now?

1506
01:44:32,481 --> 01:44:35,275
It's not yours,
with all your $2,000 suits...

1507
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:37,361
and all your front-page
"Dapper Don" shit?

1508
01:44:36,944 --> 01:44:40,489
Even your lawyer didn't know
how to pull it in.

1509
01:44:39,863 --> 01:44:43,867
You beat the government,
you're supposed to walk away humble.

1510
01:44:43,158 --> 01:44:46,453
You're not supposed to stand in front
of TV cameras crowin' about it...

1511
01:44:45,911 --> 01:44:49,623
'cause it's gonna
come back in your face.

1512
01:44:48,956 --> 01:44:52,125
I got news for you.

1513
01:44:51,583 --> 01:44:54,837
It ain't me on those tapes.

1514
01:44:54,294 --> 01:44:58,382
Truth is, it's your big mouth
that brought this borgata down.

1515
01:44:57,631 --> 01:45:00,759
Let me ask you something.

1516
01:45:00,259 --> 01:45:03,887
If Neil himself come up
with the widow Cirelli's apartment...

1517
01:45:03,220 --> 01:45:07,140
and Joe Watts swept it, how am I
supposed to know it was bugged?

1518
01:45:08,058 --> 01:45:11,061
Sammy, what do they got?

1519
01:45:10,519 --> 01:45:12,938
They got some tapes.

1520
01:45:13,522 --> 01:45:17,192
They got no witnesses.
They got tapes.

1521
01:45:16,525 --> 01:45:20,904
So, let 'em play the livin' shit
outta the tapes.

1522
01:45:20,112 --> 01:45:22,656
Let 'em leak.
I don't give a fuck.

1523
01:45:22,197 --> 01:45:26,368
It's like hearin' the same song
over and over again.

1524
01:45:25,617 --> 01:45:29,037
You play it enough,
you don't hear it no more.

1525
01:45:30,873 --> 01:45:33,083
You hear me?

1526
01:45:32,708 --> 01:45:35,419
All right.
Whatever you say, John.

1527
01:45:45,012 --> 01:45:47,681
- What?
- Your friend, Gravano...

1528
01:45:47,222 --> 01:45:49,683
was just escorted
from the building.

1529
01:45:49,266 --> 01:45:51,768
Thought you might like to know.

1530
01:46:12,956 --> 01:46:14,374
Sit.

1531
01:46:18,378 --> 01:46:20,797
I think we all know
why we're here.

1532
01:46:21,381 --> 01:46:23,258
I've got a lot to offer.

1533
01:46:24,885 --> 01:46:27,346
And I got a lot of concerns.

1534
01:46:30,098 --> 01:46:32,893
So I'm thinking that maybe
we can make a deal.

1535
01:46:32,434 --> 01:46:34,937
What kind of deal?

1536
01:46:37,898 --> 01:46:40,317
If I talk, I walk.

1537
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:42,444
Impossible.
You'll have to do time.

1538
01:46:43,237 --> 01:46:46,448
- How much?
- Less than 20.

1539
01:46:45,906 --> 01:46:49,910
And whatever's worked out, we'll be
obliged to inform Gotti's lawyer.

1540
01:46:49,201 --> 01:46:52,287
Once that happens,
word is out.

1541
01:46:54,998 --> 01:46:57,751
Everything's gonna come out
in the trial, right?

1542
01:46:57,251 --> 01:46:58,919
Everything.

1543
01:46:59,711 --> 01:47:04,424
So when Deborah finds out
I killed her brother, 18 others...

1544
01:47:03,549 --> 01:47:05,384
she'll file for divorce.

1545
01:47:06,552 --> 01:47:09,054
That part of my life is over.

1546
01:47:08,595 --> 01:47:11,265
So what's your motive, Sammy?

1547
01:47:10,806 --> 01:47:13,475
Revenge? Repentance? What?

1548
01:47:13,016 --> 01:47:16,019
What are you talkin' about?

1549
01:47:15,477 --> 01:47:17,980
You heard those tapes.

1550
01:47:18,564 --> 01:47:21,859
John and I are finished.

1551
01:47:21,275 --> 01:47:24,236
So either I spend
the rest of my life in jail...

1552
01:47:23,694 --> 01:47:26,530
or I'm out on the streets.

1553
01:47:26,029 --> 01:47:28,115
Either way, I'm dead.

1554
01:47:27,781 --> 01:47:31,994
So what kind of information
you have to offer?

1555
01:47:34,079 --> 01:47:36,582
I'll give you
the whole Cosa Nostra.

1556
01:47:37,457 --> 01:47:40,043
I'll give you
the Paul Castellano hit.

1557
01:47:40,627 --> 01:47:44,840
I'll testify that I personally
fixed the Giacalone jury.

1558
01:47:45,507 --> 01:47:49,344
I'll give you the murders
of Louie DiBono, Louie Malito...

1559
01:47:48,677 --> 01:47:52,514
Mickey De Batt,
Robert DiBernardo...

1560
01:47:51,805 --> 01:47:55,726
Tommy Spinelli,
Willy Boy Johnson...

1561
01:47:56,185 --> 01:47:58,187
a dozen or so more.

1562
01:47:59,313 --> 01:48:01,064
Tommy Sparrow.

1563
01:48:02,733 --> 01:48:06,987
I'll give you
the John O'Connor shooting.

1564
01:48:06,195 --> 01:48:09,364
I'll give you the ins and outs
of the Gambino family...

1565
01:48:08,822 --> 01:48:10,616
from upstate New York
to Brooklyn.

1566
01:48:10,324 --> 01:48:13,577
Salvatore "Sammythe Bull" Gravano...

1567
01:48:12,993 --> 01:48:16,246
underboss of the notorious
Gambino crime family...

1568
01:48:15,662 --> 01:48:20,709
has agreed to testify
against John Gotti and Frank LoCascio.

1569
01:48:19,791 --> 01:48:23,003
Gravano,
himself an admitted killer...

1570
01:48:22,461 --> 01:48:24,922
will expose
the vast criminal enterprise...

1571
01:48:24,546 --> 01:48:26,590
he served for 30years.

1572
01:48:26,256 --> 01:48:28,717
In return for his testimony...

1573
01:48:28,342 --> 01:48:30,802
the government
has charged Mr. Gravano...

1574
01:48:30,385 --> 01:48:32,804
with a single count
of racketeering.

1575
01:48:32,387 --> 01:48:35,265
Known as "The Bull"
among associates...

1576
01:48:34,723 --> 01:48:39,186
Sammy Gravano has been seen for years
in the constant company of Mr. Gotti.

1577
01:48:38,393 --> 01:48:42,898
Gravano was said to be trusted
by Gotti completely.

1578
01:48:42,105 --> 01:48:45,692
Federal officials today were elated
at the defection of Mr. Gravano...

1579
01:48:46,568 --> 01:48:49,821
What you got now?
You got Sammy.

1580
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:54,701
What's he doin' with his life?
Where's he goin'?

1581
01:48:55,285 --> 01:48:58,914
You know the Feds,
they see the guy...

1582
01:48:58,247 --> 01:49:01,500
they always smell out the guy
with no parameters.

1583
01:49:00,958 --> 01:49:04,211
They move right in.
This whole RICO statute bullshit...

1584
01:49:03,627 --> 01:49:07,881
is designed for the rats
by the rats.

1585
01:49:07,089 --> 01:49:09,675
You show me that Wall Street bum.

1586
01:49:09,216 --> 01:49:12,052
He stole billions
from the country.

1587
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:16,807
Walked outta the goddamn courtroom
with billions in his back pockets.

1588
01:49:15,848 --> 01:49:18,559
Frankie, you show me the bum
in that chemical company.

1589
01:49:18,141 --> 01:49:23,689
In one fuckin' day, this fuck, he kills
5,000 innocent people in an instant.

1590
01:49:23,856 --> 01:49:26,316
Did he do his instant?

1591
01:49:25,941 --> 01:49:29,778
You show me any important thief
in today's business world...

1592
01:49:29,111 --> 01:49:32,197
who's denied
his counsel of choice.

1593
01:49:32,656 --> 01:49:35,117
And they fire my lawyer?

1594
01:49:36,326 --> 01:49:38,787
Is this America?

1595
01:49:41,331 --> 01:49:43,709
We're wops, John.

1596
01:49:43,292 --> 01:49:47,671
We're fools. You know why?
'Cause we did it.

1597
01:49:46,879 --> 01:49:52,384
We let Sammy into something
that's called "a thing of ours."

1598
01:49:53,510 --> 01:49:55,179
And you know what?

1599
01:49:54,887 --> 01:49:57,598
On my mother I say this:

1600
01:49:57,139 --> 01:50:00,934
Let Sammy have his millions,
let him have his witness protection.

1601
01:50:00,225 --> 01:50:04,313
'Cause every day
he's still gonna wake up to the rat...

1602
01:50:07,274 --> 01:50:09,776
starin' him in the mirror.

1603
01:50:11,278 --> 01:50:12,988
He's gonna have nothin'.

1604
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:18,702
I'm gonna sit right here...

1605
01:50:19,620 --> 01:50:22,122
and still with me...

1606
01:50:23,165 --> 01:50:25,709
there's gonna be Cosa Nostra...

1607
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:30,881
till I die.

1608
01:50:30,422 --> 01:50:33,300
The government calls
Salvatore Gravano.

1609
01:50:52,236 --> 01:50:54,279
Will you raise
your right hand, please?

1610
01:50:53,946 --> 01:50:56,240
Put your left hand
on the Bible.

1611
01:50:55,822 --> 01:50:58,325
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...

1612
01:50:57,908 --> 01:51:01,036
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1613
01:51:00,452 --> 01:51:02,871
- I do.
- You can sit down.

1614
01:51:04,331 --> 01:51:07,292
Mr. Gravano,
do you have a nickname?

1615
01:51:06,792 --> 01:51:08,627
Excuse me?

1616
01:51:08,293 --> 01:51:10,838
Do your friends
call you Salvatore?

1617
01:51:11,588 --> 01:51:14,800
Would you keep your voice up, please?
That microphone isn't on.

1618
01:51:14,258 --> 01:51:17,261
Do your friends
call you Salvatore?

1619
01:51:16,760 --> 01:51:18,428
No.

1620
01:51:18,178 --> 01:51:20,848
What do your friends call you?

1621
01:51:20,430 --> 01:51:21,640
Sammy.

1622
01:51:22,724 --> 01:51:25,853
My friends call me Sammy.

1623
01:51:25,310 --> 01:51:30,107
Sammy, would you describe your position
in the Gambino crime family...

1624
01:51:29,231 --> 01:51:33,193
relative to the defendant,
Mr. Gotti?

1625
01:51:33,318 --> 01:51:36,738
He was the boss,
and I was the underboss.

1626
01:51:36,154 --> 01:51:38,699
And did you commit murder
and other crimes...

1627
01:51:38,282 --> 01:51:43,161
as part of your association with
Mr. Gotti and the Gambino crime family?

1628
01:51:42,244 --> 01:51:43,745
Yes.

1629
01:51:44,496 --> 01:51:46,915
In addition to Mr. Gotti...

1630
01:51:46,498 --> 01:51:50,586
are there other members of the Gambino
crime family in this courtroom...

1631
01:51:54,214 --> 01:51:57,050
The defendants will rise.

1632
01:51:56,550 --> 01:51:59,887
Clerk will read the verdict.

1633
01:51:59,261 --> 01:52:02,681
We, the jury,
unanimously find the defendants...

1634
01:52:02,055 --> 01:52:05,809
John Joseph Gotti
and Frank LoCascio...

1635
01:52:05,142 --> 01:52:07,978
guilty on all counts.

1636
01:52:12,649 --> 01:52:15,235
Order in the court! Order!

1637
01:52:17,154 --> 01:52:18,405
Mr. Gotti...

1638
01:52:18,238 --> 01:52:20,866
having been found guilty
on all counts...

1639
01:52:20,407 --> 01:52:23,202
you are hereby sentenced
to life imprisonment...

1640
01:52:22,701 --> 01:52:26,038
without the possibility
of parole.

1641
01:52:25,412 --> 01:52:28,415
The sentence is to be served
in federal prison...

1642
01:52:27,915 --> 01:52:29,833
in the state of Illinois.

1643
01:52:44,264 --> 01:52:46,850
Makes you think.

1644
01:52:46,433 --> 01:52:49,061
Makes you think about
the people in your life...

1645
01:52:49,436 --> 01:52:51,855
and I think of Neil...

1646
01:52:51,438 --> 01:52:54,107
if he was here,
what he'd say to me.

1647
01:52:53,607 --> 01:52:56,818
He'd say,
"John, what's life about...

1648
01:52:56,276 --> 01:52:59,404
if you don't go through it
as a man's man?"

1649
01:53:02,449 --> 01:53:05,035
He'd say, "Suck it up,
take the fall, do the time.

1650
01:53:04,576 --> 01:53:07,996
That's made you who you are.
That makes you what you are."

1651
01:53:07,371 --> 01:53:11,667
How long we been around,
this thing of ours, this Cosa Nostra?

1652
01:53:10,916 --> 01:53:13,210
120 years.

1653
01:53:12,835 --> 01:53:17,130
What's it about?
It's about rules. Parameters.

1654
01:53:17,422 --> 01:53:20,509
You take the beatin'for the friend.
You don't lay down.

1655
01:53:19,967 --> 01:53:23,136
You don't betray who you are,
what you are.

1656
01:53:33,522 --> 01:53:36,733
You gotta remember Angie,
my brother Gene, Joey D'Mig.

1657
01:53:36,191 --> 01:53:38,944
They don't roll.
They're doin'a thousand years now.

1658
01:53:38,485 --> 01:53:40,904
They don't rat. Why?
That's the rule.

1659
01:53:40,487 --> 01:53:42,948
You don't break.
You don't rat.

1660
01:54:03,552 --> 01:54:06,597
They want me to be something
I wasn 't even born to be.

1661
01:54:07,264 --> 01:54:10,225
Humble.
Okay, so you humble me.

1662
01:54:09,725 --> 01:54:13,061
What you got now?
You got a war.

1663
01:54:12,436 --> 01:54:16,648
You got global war. You got
a worldwide crime syndicate now.

1664
01:54:15,898 --> 01:54:19,443
There's no rules.
There's no parameters.

1665
01:54:18,775 --> 01:54:20,611
There's no feelings.

1666
01:54:22,654 --> 01:54:25,199
There's no feelings
for this country.

1667
01:54:30,245 --> 01:54:33,123
So, five, ten years from now...

1668
01:54:32,623 --> 01:54:35,375
they gonna wish there was
American Cosa Nostra.

1669
01:54:37,419 --> 01:54:39,922
