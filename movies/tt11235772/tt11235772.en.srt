00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,458
So, we're really
gonna do this, huh?

- Yeah.

40
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,920

- Huge step. Ooh.

41
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,464
It's really big, and if this
doesn't work out...

42
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,592

00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,886
Maybe we should just
call it off now.

- Kids?
- Yes.

00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:09,750
Like, it's really important
that we have

75

- this conversation right now.
- Okay.

76
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:13,170
Can we...

77
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,214
not have kids
for at least four years?

78
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,633
- (Pippa laughs)
- Yes. Geez...

79
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,051
- Yeah?
- Yes. Hell yes.

80
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,636
- (laughs)
- Ugh.

81
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,429
- Hey, don't act so...
- You scared the shit out of me.

82
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:25,265
Wait, but seriously,
I was thinking about how

83
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:28,519
I basically spent my entire life
in school, right?

84
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:29,812
As long as I've known you.

85
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,105
Yeah, like, you spent
your early 20s

86
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,856
playing in some
shitty punk clubs

87
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,733
and doing God knows what.

88
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,026
Drugs.

89
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,778
And I spent mine in the corner

90
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:41,532
of some stuffy medical library
studying till 2:00 a.m.

91
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,033
- Right.
- So I don't want some

92
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:46,120
gooey toddler to come along
and just mess up

93
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:48,789
the last few years
of being rebellious.

94
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,374
Yeah. You know what,

95
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,668
I-I've been thinking about
rebellion, too, in my own way.

96
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,586
You're about to say
something stupid right now.

97

No, no, I...

98
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,424
Well, you might think
I'm un poco loco,

99
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:01,385
but I was thinking about
taking up the accordion.

100
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,303
No. Really?

101
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,014
What-what are you
talking about, then?

102
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,932
I want to wake up Sunday morning

103
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,101
with an awful hangover
that reminds me

104
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,895
of all the terrible decisions
I made the night before.

105
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,480
That is what I'm talking about.

106
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:15,399
I'm here for it.
Hey, you deserve it.

107
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,110
You deserve all the hangovers
in the world, Pippa.

108
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,319
- I do.
- You do.

109
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:20,779
- I do.
- Yes, you do.

terrible decisions.

111

THOMAS:
That is happening.

130
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:18,962
- PIPPA: Thomas.
- What?

131
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:20,756
I don't think we should
spy on our neighbors.

132
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,883
No, we're not spying.
We're just...

133
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,385
looking outside our window,
and they happen to be

134
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:27,137
in our field of vision.

135
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,640
- Oh, oh, oh!
- PIPPA: O-Okay.

136
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,101
They have to know
that people can see in.

137
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,311
- THOMAS: Exactly.
- Like, they have to know that.

138
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,313
THOMAS:
Have to know. Have to know.

139
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,732
Is he about to do
what I think he's about to do?

140
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,067
PIPPA:
Yep.

THOMAS:
That is some good content.

142
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,864
Okay. Thomas, we're officially
being creepy weirdos.

143
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,116
- Don't you agree?
- No.

144
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,409
What? They-they want us to look.

145
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,746
But we'll stop
because you want me to.

146
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,956
Thank you.

147
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,624

- Right, right.

Let's give our new neighbors
some privacy.

It is entirely acceptable

"two eyes with wings,"

00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,305
you know, actually talk to her.

481
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,641
- (chuckles)
- Please continue.

482
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:18,351
One night, I went over
to smoke weed

483
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:19,852
and watch Deep Blue Sea...

484
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:21,604
- As one does.
- ...and I discover

485
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,981
they figured out how
to jerry-rig a laser pointer

486
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:25,566
into a long-range microphone

487
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,735
so that we could all
low-key listen in

488
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:30,363
on Kylie's private conversations

489
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,949
in hopes that she would
miraculously be confessing

490
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,742
- her love for one of them.
- Mon Dieu.

491
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:37,995
- You were an accomplice to this?
- No.

492
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,623
- Maybe. -Uh-huh.
- JONI: Okay, it was his idea,

493
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:42,083
and he masterminded
the whole thing

494
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,126
after watching a tutorial
on YouTube.

495
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:45,544
What happened?

496
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,463
- Nothing. Uh, it was...
- Uh, we turned it on.

497
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,215
- No.
- And...

498
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,342
the instant we got a signal,
everybody was crushed

499
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,552
because, from the moaning
and the giggling,

500
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:55,429
it became immediately apparent

501
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,975
that Kylie and her roommate
were having a naked tickle party

502
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,226
with Seth Gildenstein.

503
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,603
- Gildenstein?
- It's Gildensteen, yeah.

504
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:04,313
Kylie was in the 15%.

505
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:05,773
But a trivia note
on Seth Gildensteen...

506
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,692
Never was he seen
in a pair of shoes.

507
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,318
- Sorry, what?
- Like, he only ever wore Rollerblades.

508
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,654
Yeah, and still
somehow got laid.

509
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:12,905
Laid a lot.

510
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,991
Enough about Seth's choice
of footwear.

511
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:20,204
How does this
laser pointer thingy work?

512
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,582
THOMAS:
Okay, class.

513
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,669
Large picture windows
just like this one,

514
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,963
when you make a noise,
they vibrate.

515
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,298
Like, right now,
this is vibrating

516
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:31,674
from the sound of my voice.

517
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,968
So, if you shine
a laser through it,

518
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:36,053
what do you think happens
to the beam?

519
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,930
It also vibrates.

520
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:39,682
Gold star for you. Exactly.

521
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:42,893
The little dot of the laser
wiggles from the vibrations.

522
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:45,021
And if you can capture
the pattern of the wiggling,

523
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:48,357
you can translate that into
waveforms you can actually hear.

524
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:49,984
Why haven't we done this yet?

525
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,445
Well, Pippa,
it's probably illegal,

526
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,363
and B, we can't.

527
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:55,865
I mean, if we shine a laser

528
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,950
into their apartment,
it terminates.

529
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,077
There's no way to capture
the vibrations

530
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:01,787
from across the street.

531
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:04,665
In order to do that, we'd have
to bounce the beam back here.

532
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:05,875
Wait, what?

533
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,210
Unless we sneak
into Brent's studio

534
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:10,504
and perfectly place a mirror
behind his window,

535

Okay, go right.

640
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,315
A little more... and stop.

641
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,193
Stop, stop. And now go up.

642
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,195
A little higher.

643
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,405
A little more, and stop.

644
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:30,240
Mwah.

645
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:31,450
Now what?

646
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:33,535
Now we hope that
the angle of the mirror

647
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,454
bounced it back here somewhere.

648
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:38,582
This isn't the most scientific
of methods.

649
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:41,877
Hold on.

650
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:48,926
Aw.

651
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,146
(gasps)

652
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,983
I am so impressed right now.

653
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:07,194
(Pippa giggles, yelps excitedly)

654
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,198
(static droning)

655
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:16,620
Man.

656
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,372
Wait, wait. Wait.

657
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:21,709
(distorted chatter over speaker)

658
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:31,802
They sound like the teachers
from Charlie Brown.

659
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,971
- Wah-wah, wah-wah, wah.
- Wah-wah.

660
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:36,098
Wah-wah-wah, wah-wah-wah.

661
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,100
(static droning)

662
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,394
(distorted chatter continues)

663
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:43,981
MARGOT (over speaker): So if I'm
feeling upset about something,

664
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:45,816
- I should just hide it?
- (Pippa gasps)

665
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:48,569
- THOMAS: Yes! (chuckles)
- (Pippa squeals excitedly)

666
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:51,280
MARGOT: I saw you go into
the bathroom with some woman.

667
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,906
BRENT: Oh, you've got to
be kidding me.

668
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,409
MARGOT:
In front of everybody.

669
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,745
Are you fucking stupid?

670
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:02,082
Did you think people
can't see you?

671
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:03,709
Did you? Hello! Hi!

672
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,754
I can't keep having
this conversation.

673
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:09,214
Okay, all right, fine,
you really want to do it now?

674
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,967
- Yeah.
- Tell me the truth.

675
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,677
Do you still love me?

676
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:15,471
Oh, fuck you. What?

677
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,181
Do you?

678
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:18,432
How-how... I'm sorry.

679
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:20,017
How are you getting that
from this?

680
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,602
Do you still love me?

681
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,729
Don't do this to me.
Don't do that.

682
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,355
(chuckles) Don't do that.

683
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:27,191
Look, I think... I think
you-you want to leave me

684
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,109
but you-you haven't got
the fucking balls to do it,

685
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,111
so you come up with
all these ridiculous excuses

686
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,447
just to try and make it
my fault and not yours.

687
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:36,283
No. No, no, no, I saw you.

688
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:37,659
BRENT: You know, I...
we're to the point

689
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:38,911
I shouldn't even
have to explain myself.

690
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,621
You're supposed to trust me.

691
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,790
You really think that I would
fuck someone in our apartment?

692
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,875
- Is that what you think of me?
- I-I thought...

693
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,627
- I saw you.
- You thought what?

694
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,087
You know, I get it. I get it.
You're insecure about my work.

695
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:50,631
I get it. That makes sense.

696
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,299
Okay, you've told me
a hundred times.

697
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,384
But without my work,
who's gonna pay for all this?

698
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,886
- Are you? Huh?
- That's not fair.

699
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,304
Your income gonna support us?

700
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,223
I mean, if you get...
if we get divorced,

701
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:01,099
don't know what you're gonna do.

702
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:02,684
Whoa, whoa. I...

703
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,728
I don't want a divorce.

704
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:06,980
I-I... No.
(chuckles, sighs)

705
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:09,107
At a certain point, I have to
start thinking about it, Jules.

706
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:10,734
- I'm trying my best here.
- I sorry, Seb. Sorry.

707
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:13,654
I'm really trying, but what...
what else can I do?

708
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:16,490
How long am I supposed to put up
with this?

709
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,993
I'm sorry.

710
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:21,411
If you're sorry, you'd change.

711
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:22,830
I will. I will.

712
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:24,414
Will you? Don't. Will you?

713
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,458
Huh? Will you?

714
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,293
- Will you change?
- Yes.

715
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:29,878
- You will?
- Yes.

716
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,630
Okay, so did I fuck
someone tonight?

717
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:32,923
- No. No.
- No?

718
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:34,466
Did-did...
Was someone sucking my cock?

719
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,634
- No.
- No, they weren't.

720
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,177
- Do you still love me?
- Yes.

721
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:40,222
Then stop acting
like such a fucking cunt!

722
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,140
I'm tired.

I think I'm coming down
with something.

729

Yeah.

I actually haven't had my eyes
checked in, like, a few years.

It might've changed.

Pippa, you could squeeze her in

Uh...

763
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:12,374
You have terrible vision.

764
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:14,334
But...

765
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:16,128
most people's vision sucks.

766
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,296
It's how I have a job.

767
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:20,340
I'm gonna look at
the surface of your eye

768
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:22,175
to see if there's
any imperfections.

- Okay.
- So just put your chin...

Look up.

00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,388
Left.

777
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,098
Good.

778
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,184
Right.

779
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:14,352
Good.

780
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,401
Once again.

781
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:29,868
I'm so indecisive.
What do you think?

782
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:33,205
Well, those are
definitely more...

783
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,290
"sexy librarian."

784
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,458
(both laugh)

785
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,627
- Sexy librarian?
- Yeah, like...

786
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,420
"Meet me in the stacks, big boy.

787
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:43,048
Let's read the latest
Emma Straub novel together."

788
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:46,718
Where these,
they're more "femme fatale."

789
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:49,262
Like...
"I'm gonna bang Doogie Howser,

then slit his throat."

791

Oh, my God.

792
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:54,643
Do you think
I can pull these off?

793
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:55,894
Course you can.

794
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:58,355
The great thing
about new glasses is

795
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:00,148
you get to decide
who you want to be.

796
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:02,067
Well, okay.

797
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,611
These ones remind me
of my barista.

798
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:05,779
So...

799
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:07,864
I guess...

800
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:10,742
I am the femme fatale.

801
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,286
I think you might be.

802
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,789
They really are so you.

803
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:20,627
Hey, um, this might
sound weird...

804
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:26,258
Maybe this is awkward.
Um, would you ever want to get

805
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:29,386
a cup of coffee sometime
or something?

806
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:30,470
Is that weird?

807
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:31,888
No.

808
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,223
Are you sure?

809
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:35,267
No, I'd... I'd love that.

810
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:38,895
I mean, I know we just met,
but you seem cool.

811
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:40,730
Thank you.

812
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:43,275
Well, uh,
can I have your number?

813
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:45,777
Yeah. My cell.

814
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:48,071
Awesome. Um, well,
some friends of mine

815
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,573
opened a spa this weekend.

816
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:52,242
Maybe we could
check that out or something?

817
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:53,702
- I'll call you.
- Yeah.

818
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,954
- That-that sounds amazing.
- Okay.

819
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,999
- Bye.
- Bye. (laughs)

820
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,503
Mom, what's wrong?

821
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:05,088
(sighs)

822
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:09,384
(upbeat jingle playing)

823
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,310

824
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,270
NARRATOR (over computer):
Whether it's your birthday,

825
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:22,272
anniversary or any old Tuesday,

826
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,191
there's always
a reason to celebrate.

827
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,401
So don't let E.D.
ruin your party.

828
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,570
Ask your doctor if your heart
is healthy enough for...

829
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:30,947
- (button clicks)
- (video stops)

830

(static droning)

831
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:47,589
BRENT: Can you put
your fingers around the frame?

832
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,132
It's your frame.
It's not a prop.

833
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,675
You own it, okay?

834
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,385
I mean, I'd love
to go down on you.

835
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,137
THOMAS:
What? What did he just say?

836
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:56,848
BRENT: Okay, try this.
Put your arms up at the top.

837
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:58,433
That's it. Hold it.

838
00:41:58,558 --> 00:41:59,935
You earned it. Come on.

839
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,811
THOMAS: "Oh, we just both
have our shirts off.

840
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:04,773
And everything is fine
and completely professional."

841
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:06,358
BRENT:
Ever since you walked in here,

842
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,235
I've been wondering
what you taste like.

843
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:09,694
THOMAS:
Oh, geez Louise.

844
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:12,739
- Can you take it down a notch?
- BRENT: Okay.

845
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:14,699
(laughs) Got it.

846
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,076
See? Look at your face.

847
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,578
- It's a trap.
- You're genuinely shocked.

848
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:20,747
I thought you were
being serious.

849
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,332
I was.

850
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,292
THOMAS:
No. No, no, no, no, no.

851
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:25,835
Too touchy.

852
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,296
Get your big-ass necklace
and get out of there, girl.

853
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,757
BRENT:
There's no extra charge for it.

854
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,634
You usually charge?

855
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,636
Oh, yeah, usually,
it's an extra 200 bucks...

856
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:37,305
The cunnilingus fee...
But I'll waive it for you.

857
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,724
- THOMAS: Oh, my God.
- (model laughing)

858
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:41,685
Well, I appreciate that.

859
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:43,603
Look, come on. What's the issue?

860
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:46,398
- Come on, bruh.
- MODEL: I'm not gonna...

861
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,149
Look, you can go sit
on the metro

862
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:50,694
and wonder what it would've
been like if you stayed,

863
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:54,531
or you can stay for 30 minutes,

864
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:57,826
and I'll make you come harder
than you ever thought possible.

865
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:00,412
THOMAS:
What? What? I...

866
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:03,206
This can't actually work.

867
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:09,004
- Okay.
- THOMAS: Ugh.

868
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,006
All right.

869
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,767
(model moaning)

870
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,272
- BRENT: Feels good, right?
- MODEL: Yeah.

871
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:36,906
What?

872
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,199
Uh-huh.

873
00:43:38,325 --> 00:43:40,118
- What? What?
- Yeah.

874
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,286
- Yes.
- Shut up.

875
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:42,454
- I know!
- What?

876
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:44,080
Did you talk to her?

877
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:47,083
If, by "her," you mean Julia,
then yeah.

878
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,626
Julia?

879
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:51,129
But, dude, I know what the
inside of her oculus looks like.

880
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:53,465
Of all the eye clinics
in the world...

881
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:55,091
She walks into mine.

882
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:58,470
And what's even crazier,
we totally hit it off

883
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,472
and we're gonna hang out
this weekend.

884
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:02,349
- This is crazy!
- To be honest,

885
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:04,142
I think that
she just needs a friend.

886
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:08,104
Someone to talk to about her
super unhealthy relationship.

887
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:10,732
Uh, y-yeah, I saw him today.

888
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,318
He-he kind of took advantage
of this girl.

889
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:16,696
What? He screwed someone
while she was with me?

890
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,656
Uh, technically oral,

891
00:44:18,782 --> 00:44:21,826
but it was not cool, so...

892
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,745
I don't know, I-I was thinking,

893
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,247
and I think maybe
this isn't good for us.

894
00:44:26,373 --> 00:44:27,832
- (toilet flushes)
- PIPPA: Yeah. I agree.

895
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:29,501
It felt weird not telling her.

896
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,252
Yeah, but it-it feels weird
to be spying

897
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:32,462
on our neighbors, right?

898
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:34,005
I mean, sneaking around,

899
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:36,007
keeping our lights off
so they don't see us.

900
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:38,802
You're not really seeing her
this weekend, are you?

901
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:41,388
If I was cheating on you,
wouldn't you want to know?

902
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:43,431
I don't know that I would.

903
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:46,518
I don't love that you keep going
to these hypothetical places.

904
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,395
But it's not hypothetical here.

905
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:51,147
That asshole is being
totally unfaithful,

906
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:52,690
and we know that, so now I have

907
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:55,860
the moral responsibility
to do the right thing.

908
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:57,904
Okay, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

909
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,407
Chicken. Babe.

910
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:02,492
When we decided
to move in together,

911
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:06,413
I-I was excited about
you and me taking this step.

912
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:08,456
I get that you're trying
to do the right thing...

913
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:11,668
I-I-I get it...
But let's get back to us.

914
00:45:13,128 --> 00:45:17,048
Maybe I-I could just
tell her this weekend.

915
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:24,347
(sighs)

916
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:27,517
Am I not enough for you?

917
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,978
I promise I will rip
the Band-Aid off and be done.

918
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:31,479
You're not listening.

919
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:34,149
Maybe it'll give her
the confidence she need...

920
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:35,567
Where are you going?

921
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:37,110
- I'm going to get a drink.
- But we were just...

922
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,654
Pippa, she doesn't need
to be saved.

923
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,823
She doesn't need
to be saved by you.

924
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,616
This is straight-up
none of your business.

925
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,286
Thomas.

926

JULIA (over speaker):
Hello.

928
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,050
Hello. (sighs)

929
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:03,136
Baby, I'm talking to you.

930
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:05,054
BRENT:
Yeah?

931
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:10,310
JULIA:
Hmm? Hmm?

932
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,230
(chuckles)

933
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:20,487
I was feeling gloomy all day

934
00:46:20,612 --> 00:46:23,072
because of our little spat
last night.

935
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:25,033
And...

936
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:27,035
I really didn't mean it.

937
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,580
I was kind of hoping
I could make it up to you.

938
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:35,418
- Baby.
- Mm-hmm?

939
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:38,213
Um...

940
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:42,842
- Just...
- Just relax, will you?

941
00:46:42,926 --> 00:46:44,761
BRENT:
Okay, I am... I am relaxed.

942
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,721
- JULIA: You're not relaxed.
- I'm just... I am relaxed.

943
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,766
- JULIA: Mm-mm.
- I'm just not really

944
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,935
in the mood for it, okay?

945
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:54,979
Are you sure
I can't convince you?

946
00:46:55,063 --> 00:46:58,024
We can do birthday-only stuff.

947
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,110
Hey, you're really sweet.
It's just...

948
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:03,530
just not tonight, okay?

949
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:05,532
I forgive you for yesterday.

950
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:07,408
I do.

00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,031
Let's go.

960
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:53,997
JULIA: You seem
to really love your job.

961
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,541
PIPPA:
I do. I... I don't know,

962
00:47:56,666 --> 00:48:00,670
I-I had the realization
the other day that...

963
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:02,589
I really like ophthalmology.

964
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:05,049
Like, it just, it makes sense
to my brain.

965
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:06,968
- You're really good at it.
- (laughs)

966
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:08,386
Thank you.

967
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:11,598
But I'm gonna be doing it
for the rest of my life.

968
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:14,309
And I've finally achieved
the one thing

969
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,978
that I've worked
years and years to do,

970
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:20,607
and in the process,
I kind of killed off

971
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:23,026
all possibilities
of something else.

972
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:24,569
- Yeah.
- It's like when you're

973
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,821
so obsessed with something
that you forget

974
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:30,116
to pick your head up
and look around and go,

975
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:31,784
"Oh, wait.

976
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:33,786
What am I even doing?"

977
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:39,000
But you're too far down
the rabbit hole.

978
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,672
Yeah.

979
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:47,091
I have the opposite problem
as you.

980
00:48:47,175 --> 00:48:49,010
PIPPA:
What do you do?

981
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:51,679
I'm kind of trying
to figure that out.

982
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:53,640
I was a...

983
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:55,433
I was a model.

984
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:57,060
(chuckles) Oh, my God.

985
00:48:57,185 --> 00:48:59,020
I say that like
I'm embarrassed about it.

986
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,105
Um, I was a model,

987
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:03,232
but I'm not anymore.

988
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:05,026
What do you mean?

989
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:06,819
It's complicated. (sighs)

990
00:49:06,903 --> 00:49:10,782
I guess it's hard to find
deeper meaning in your work

991
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:13,409
when your job is to force up
a smile every day

992
00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:16,788
for the world to decide
whether you're sexy enough.

993
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:20,124
I mean, even though you feel
numb and objectified,

994
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:21,959
you're addicted because

995
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:24,921
your sense of self-worth
is all wrapped up in it.

996
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:28,466
I decided that
my second nervous breakdown

997
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:30,635
would be my last.

998
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:33,471
I walked away.

999
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:36,599
Now I'm looking at the rest
of my life, and I'm so lost.

1000
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:38,768
- (chuckles softly)
- But...

1001
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:41,396
you could do anything.

1002
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:44,148
What's holding you back?

1003
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:46,275
Honestly, myself.

1004
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:49,779
I have like 8,000 interests
and zero skills.

1005
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:51,447
(laughs)
Come on, that's not true.

1006
00:49:51,531 --> 00:49:53,908
Seriously. I...
I didn't go to college.

1007
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,576
I can barely type.

1008
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:57,370
I just bought
this wireless printer,

1009
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,622
and it took me literally forever
to figure out how it works.

1010
00:49:59,706 --> 00:50:01,624
Yeah, well, on the plus side,

1011
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:03,710
you don't have
any student loans.

1012
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:06,337
On the minus side,
I don't have a career.

1013
00:50:06,421 --> 00:50:08,756
My husband, he got me this job

1014
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,801
working at this, like,
fancy-pants photo studio.

1015
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:14,220
And it's cool,
I get to travel around

1016
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:16,889
for gallery openings and such,
and it's-it's neat,

1017
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:21,269
but it's not my raison d'être.

1018
00:50:28,151 --> 00:50:30,319
(quiet chatter)

1019
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:46,335
This feels so nice.

1020
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:52,383
What are you waiting for?

1021
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:04,687
PIPPA:
So, your husband, what's he do?

1022
00:51:04,771 --> 00:51:06,564
Oh. His name's Sebastian.
Well, Seb.

1023
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:07,857
Seb.

1024
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,026
He's a photographer.

1025
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:11,736
Like, a real one. (chuckles)

1026
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:14,238
Kind of a name
in that world, actually.

1027
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:15,865
- (chuckles)
- He's a genius.

1028
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:18,284
I mean, I know people throw
that word around a lot,

1029
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:20,036
but he really is one.

1030
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,538
Did you guys meet through work?

1031
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:26,292
We... might've slept together
after a shoot.

1032
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:29,545
- (chuckles)
- Usually when that would happen,

1033
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:33,716
I was just another exotic flavor
for them to try, but...

1034
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:38,471
Seb, he loves me.

1035
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:40,723
He sounds like a catch.

1036
00:51:40,807 --> 00:51:44,101
Oh, and he's, like,
incredible in bed, so...

1037
00:51:44,227 --> 00:51:45,812
(laughs)

1038
00:51:45,937 --> 00:51:48,731
Oh, must be all
sunshine and roses, then, huh?

1039
00:51:48,815 --> 00:51:50,233
Yeah...

1040
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:54,654
I mean, he's an artist,
so he's...

1041
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:56,447
eccentric.

1042
00:51:56,572 --> 00:52:00,952
Um, that comes with
a certain baggage.

1043
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:03,830
But without him, I...

1044
00:52:03,955 --> 00:52:07,166
don't know what I'd do
with my life.

1045
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,628
He's all I've got.

1046
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:33,985
Are you okay, Margot?

1047
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:40,449
Who's Margot?

1048
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:42,743
Julia. (laughs)

1049
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:44,662
I'm so sorry.
I know your name.

1050
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:47,456
(laughing):
Margot. That is so funny,

1051
00:52:47,582 --> 00:52:49,876
'cause, like,
I just had this Hallow...

1052
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:55,298
Anyway, my husband is just
a complex individual is all.

1053
00:52:56,591 --> 00:52:58,676
You should meet him sometime.

1054
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:02,305
- Yeah. (chuckles)
- Yeah.

1055

Yeah, I will. Thank you.

I couldn't just
sit back and watch.

You didn't need to watch, Pippa.

1106

We both decided to peer in
on them. We both did that.

So it's not my fault

this woman stab this man?

You ever been in
a serious relationship?

1279
01:12:12,537 --> 01:12:14,414
Yeah.

1280
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:17,375
And did your boyfriend
or girlfriend...

1281
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,793
It's a boyfriend.

1282
01:12:18,877 --> 01:12:20,795
Did your boyfriend
ever masturbate?

1283
01:12:20,879 --> 01:12:22,630
Um... (chuckles)

1284
01:12:22,714 --> 01:12:24,340
- Probably.
- He did.

1285
01:12:24,466 --> 01:12:26,009
Did you?

1286
01:12:26,134 --> 01:12:27,594
Maybe.

1287
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:31,806
And did this simple act change
the love you had for him?

1288
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:32,766
No.

1289
01:12:32,891 --> 01:12:34,142
It didn't. Why is that?

1290
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:35,810
I don't know.
Because it's meaningless.

1291
01:12:35,894 --> 01:12:38,271
Exactly. And tell me this...

1292
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:41,524
What's the difference between
your vibrator and a human penis?

1293
01:12:41,608 --> 01:12:43,485
(chuckles) How do you know
I have a vibrator?

1294
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:44,861
'Cause you're a woman.

1295
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:48,490
A vibrator doesn't
have feelings.

1296
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:51,701
A vibrator isn't
connected to a brain.

1297
01:12:51,785 --> 01:12:53,953
I would argue that most penises
aren't connected to a brain.

1298
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:55,997
A vibrator isn't
connected to a soul.

1299
01:12:56,081 --> 01:12:57,624
Well, I don't know about you,

1300
01:12:57,749 --> 01:12:59,626
but I've had plenty of sex
that was just as meaningless,

1301
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:01,336
if not more meaningless
than masturbation.

1302
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:03,838
The only difference is
it's just more fun

1303
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:06,966
having sex with a person
than it is with your hand.

1304
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:09,594
Not everyone agrees with you.

1305
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:11,304
(song ends)

1306
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:13,640
("People, I've Been Sad" by
Christine and the Queens plays)

1307
01:13:13,765 --> 01:13:16,392
No, they don't.

1308
01:13:17,769 --> 01:13:20,939
No matter how much
you fucking love them.

1309
01:13:23,525 --> 01:13:25,318
(Seb exhales, sniffs)

1310
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,737
(song continues
with singing in French)

1311
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:31,199
(swallows, sighs)

1312
01:13:36,955 --> 01:13:39,165
Sorry, I'm just... I'm...

1313
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:43,461
I'm going through
the most difficult, um,

1314
01:13:43,545 --> 01:13:46,589
separation of my life right now.

1315
01:13:46,673 --> 01:13:48,591
And, um...

1316
01:13:48,716 --> 01:13:51,219
I know I can be a bit blunt.
I'm sorry.

1317
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:54,806
It's okay.

1318
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:56,766
Thanks.

1319
01:13:59,519 --> 01:14:01,563
(sighs)

1320
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:17,787
"The Ass and His Masters."

1321
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:19,205
Say what?

1322
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:20,748
"The Ass and His Masters."

1323
01:14:20,832 --> 01:14:23,126
It's a fable.
You just made me think of it.

1324
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:26,880
The ass referring
to a donkey in this case.

1325
01:14:27,005 --> 01:14:29,632
Story goes...
This donkey, he's owned

1326
01:14:29,716 --> 01:14:31,551
by an herb farmer
who doesn't feed him well.

1327
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:35,263
He has to work in this garden
all day long, and he's starving.

1328
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:38,183
So he goes to this god Jupiter,
and he's like,

1329
01:14:38,308 --> 01:14:40,685
"Hey, man, can I please
get a new master?

1330
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:42,020
I'm starving over here."

1331
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:43,897
And Jupiter's feeling
really gracious,

1332
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:46,608
so he's like,
"Sure thing. Wish granted."

1333
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:49,611
And the next day, the donkey,
he is sold to a potter.

1334
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:52,488
Great. Life must be
peaches and cream now, right?

1335
01:14:52,572 --> 01:14:55,074
Wrong. It's the worst job
a donkey could have.

1336
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:57,076
He's fed well,
but now he has to carry

1337
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,829
these super heavy bricks
to and fro all day.

1338
01:14:59,913 --> 01:15:02,248
So he goes to Jupiter again,
and he's like,

1339
01:15:02,373 --> 01:15:05,501
"Hey, Jupiter, I really need
another master, please."

1340
01:15:05,585 --> 01:15:08,671
Jupiter's like,
"Whoa, slow your roll, man.

1341
01:15:08,755 --> 01:15:11,716
I'm only gonna do this
one more time. Are you sure?"

1342
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:13,927
And donkey's like,
"I got this pain in my back,

1343
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:15,261
"and it won't go away.

1344
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:17,096
"There's no such thing
as Advil yet.

1345
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:18,973
Will you please
just do me this favor?"

1346
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:22,977
So, the next day,
the donkey is sold again,

1347
01:15:23,061 --> 01:15:26,856
to a leather tanner
who hangs donkey,

1348
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:28,983
bleeds him out, skins him

1349
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:32,695
and turns him into
a pair of sandals.

1350
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:34,447
Moral of the story:

1351
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,658
He who finds discontentment
in one place

1352
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:40,036
is unlikely
to find happiness in another.

1353
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:47,043
You know why Aesop
wrote that fable?

1354
01:15:48,628 --> 01:15:53,216
I-I just said, to show that
the grass isn't greener.

1355
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,469
No.

1356
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:58,721
He wrote it for his slaves.

1357
01:15:58,805 --> 01:16:00,098
So when they're feeling down,

1358
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:01,683
they could tell each other
that story

1359
01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:04,227
and make themselves feel better.

1360
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,313
When in reality,

1361
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:10,233
they were just
deeply, deeply repressed.

1362
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:18,533
Would it be strange if I asked
to take your picture?

1363
01:16:18,658 --> 01:16:20,868
(elevator clunks, whirs)

1364
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:32,797
(elevator clunks)

1365
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:45,560
SEB:
Watch out for broken glass.

1366
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:47,687
I had a little accident.

1367
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:53,693
PIPPA:
It's a nice place.

1368
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:56,487
SEB: Let's break out
the good stuff, shall we?

1369
01:16:57,739 --> 01:16:59,240
Scassari.

1370
01:16:59,324 --> 01:17:03,453
The grapes are grown under the
shadow of a volcano in Italy.

1371
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:08,416
So you're a professional?

1372
01:17:08,499 --> 01:17:09,667
(cork pops)

1373
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:11,711
Sure.

1374
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:25,767
You know, my latest
exhibition opens in a few weeks.

1375
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,685
You should come.

1376
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:31,898
Uh, I'll think about it.

1377
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:37,904
Would you stand there for me?

1378
01:17:38,029 --> 01:17:40,073
(quietly):
Yeah.

1379
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:48,414
Turn to me.

1380
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:53,044
Those eyes.

1381
01:17:53,878 --> 01:17:55,963
You sure we've never met before?

1382
01:18:06,349 --> 01:18:08,267
- Oh, my hair's not really...
- (camera clicking)

1383
01:18:08,393 --> 01:18:09,477
No, it's good.

1384
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,270
PIPPA:
Um...

1385
01:18:11,354 --> 01:18:14,273
I-I don't know what I'm doing.

1386
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:18,778
Just do whatever I tell you
to do, and it will be perfect.

1387
01:18:20,488 --> 01:18:22,740
Put your left hand
on your shoulder.

1388
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:25,243
Head down.

1389
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:28,454
You look so kind.

1390
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:30,206
(camera clicking)

1391
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:32,083
Eyes to me.

1392
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:35,253
(camera clicking)

1393
01:18:38,131 --> 01:18:39,590
Is it okay?

1394
01:18:39,674 --> 01:18:42,969
It's just this... this jumper.

1395
01:18:44,011 --> 01:18:45,680
What's your bra look like?

1396
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:47,098
(chuckles)

1397
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:48,599
Subtle.

1398
01:18:48,683 --> 01:18:50,893
Look, I work with naked models
pretty much every day,

1399
01:18:50,977 --> 01:18:54,105
so I forget it's...
it's out of the ordinary.

1400
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:57,108
But if you're not comfortable,
it's cool.

1401
01:18:58,943 --> 01:19:00,611
(sighs)

1402
01:19:00,695 --> 01:19:04,282
No, it's-it's... it's fine.

1403
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:06,117
Um...

1404
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:08,119
just, like...

1405
01:19:10,329 --> 01:19:12,457
- Cute.
- (Pippa chuckles softly)

1406
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:14,584
Mind if I snap a few?

1407
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:17,837
(chuckles softly)

1408
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:26,721
Uh, let me.

1409
01:19:33,019 --> 01:19:35,062
- (camera clicking)
- PIPPA: Um. (chuckles)

1410
01:19:35,188 --> 01:19:36,939
I wasn't ready.

1411
01:19:37,023 --> 01:19:40,067
I tend to take my best pictures
when you least expect it.

1412
01:19:40,193 --> 01:19:42,361
(camera clicking)

1413
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:48,618
- Now what?
- (camera clicking)

1414
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:51,412
What about your underwear?

1415
01:20:08,054 --> 01:20:10,223
(Pippa sighs)

1416
01:20:11,224 --> 01:20:13,267
Turn away from me.

1417
01:20:15,102 --> 01:20:16,521
Okay.

1418
01:20:16,604 --> 01:20:18,940
You have a magnificent body.

1419
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:20,816
- (chuckles)
- (camera clicking)

1420
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,568
Thank you.

1421
01:20:23,402 --> 01:20:24,529
Eyes to me.

1422
01:20:24,654 --> 01:20:26,405
- (camera clicking)
- Chin up slightly.

1423
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:29,283
That's it.
Now take off your bra.

1424
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:31,953
Uh, what? (chuckles)

1425
01:20:32,078 --> 01:20:32,995
Okay.

1426
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,206
I'll make it less awkward.

1427
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:37,416
(laughs)

1428
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:38,626
What are you doing?

1429
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:40,962
What does it look like?

1430
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:47,802
(chuckles)

1431
01:20:56,102 --> 01:20:58,563
- Nice socks.
- Thanks.

1432
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:01,148
(Pippa laughs)

1433
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,322
Your turn.

1434
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:14,954
(takes deep breath)

1435
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:52,074
(camera clicking)

1436
01:21:55,036 --> 01:21:57,413

You cannot blame yourself
for this.

I caused the whole thing to...

No, no, no.
Yes, it is tragic.

It's more than tragic...
It is fucking insane...

But you had no idea
that this would happen.

1488
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,915
I mean, you were just dumped.

Hi. (chuckles)

1553
01:33:39,573 --> 01:33:43,744
This new exhibition tells
a modern fable.

1554
01:33:43,827 --> 01:33:45,954
It's a tragic tale

1555
01:33:46,038 --> 01:33:49,291
of a sweet young woman
named Pippa.

1556
01:33:56,673 --> 01:33:58,759
Oh, my God.

1557
01:34:05,349 --> 01:34:08,101
Pippa lives in
the apartment we own

1558
01:34:08,185 --> 01:34:10,312
across the way from our studio.

1559
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:14,149
When she and her boyfriend
Thomas

1560
01:34:14,232 --> 01:34:16,693
first moved in together,
their future was bright.

1561
01:34:16,777 --> 01:34:19,613
Things were...
things were downright peachy.

1562
01:34:20,947 --> 01:34:22,741
Then they got
a little distracted

1563
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:25,285
by the strangers across the way.

1564
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:26,953
Us.

1565
01:34:27,079 --> 01:34:30,499
They cared more about
what was going on

1566
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:32,793
in other people's lives
than they did their own.

1567
01:34:32,876 --> 01:34:35,462
And what started out
as a fun little hobby

1568
01:34:35,587 --> 01:34:37,672
turned into a bit
of an obsession.

1569
01:34:39,174 --> 01:34:40,759
They gate-crashed
our Halloween party

1570
01:34:40,842 --> 01:34:42,344
and planted a microphone

1571
01:34:42,427 --> 01:34:45,305
so they could secretly
listen in on our conversations.

1572
01:34:45,389 --> 01:34:48,016
Uh, totally illegal, by the way.

1573
01:34:49,267 --> 01:34:52,729
And yet, somehow,
Pippa decided that she was...

1574
01:34:52,813 --> 01:34:54,815
she was doing the right thing.

1575
01:34:55,649 --> 01:34:58,026
First, this tore them apart
emotionally.

1576
01:34:58,110 --> 01:35:00,529
And then...
it tore them apart forever.
