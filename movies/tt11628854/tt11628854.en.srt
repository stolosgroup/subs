3
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,667
Oh, Jesus.

4
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:50,602
Why are we ruining this
Christmas with this shit?

5
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:53,705
I love this song.
It's cute. It's Christmasy.

6
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:57,075
For fallen off
the fucking wagon?

7
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:58,543
Bit unfair.

8
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,512
You'd have to be pissed
to stomach this.

9
00:02:00,546 --> 00:02:02,714
Yeah, well, you know, I've got
to stomach a lot more sober,

10
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,749
including your old
schoolmates, trust me.

11
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:41,619
Thank fuck we don't
have to wear these ghastly

12
00:02:41,653 --> 00:02:42,787
Christmas jumpers again.

13
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:44,422
Oh, what a shame.

14
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,857
Thought we all looked
rather splendid.

15
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:48,893
Oh, of course you did, darling.

16
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:52,797
How's our little
Sleeping Beauty?

17
00:02:56,702 --> 00:02:59,604
Oh, Prince Charming.

18
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,974
Thank you, darling.

19
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:04,576
Mwah.

20
00:03:14,953 --> 00:03:17,689
Darling, Nell adores you.

21
00:03:17,723 --> 00:03:20,592
Well, last year,
she sat me at the kid's table.

22
00:03:20,626 --> 00:03:22,961
I'm so sorry.

23
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:30,135
We don't have to go.

24
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,936
We could go anywhere.

25
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,540
We could turn around,
just you and me.

26
00:03:35,574 --> 00:03:39,177
Oh, sweetheart, I love you.

27
00:03:39,211 --> 00:03:41,813
But Nell's like a sister to me.

28
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,949
I couldn't abandon them
this Christmas.

29
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,564
Ooh, shit,
fuck, oh, fuck!

30
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:00,899
Fly!

31
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,005
Fuck!

32
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,140
Fuck!

33
00:04:16,782 --> 00:04:19,517
God, I love Christmas songs.

34
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,520
You know you know it!
You know it! Just sing it!

35
00:04:28,694 --> 00:04:30,228
- Mom!
- Yeah?

36
00:04:30,262 --> 00:04:33,031
I've cut myself, Mom.
Fuck!

37
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:34,699
I'm coming!

38
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:53,084
I'm coming, I'm coming.

39
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:54,519
Did you find a plaster?

40
00:04:54,553 --> 00:04:56,821
No.

41
00:04:56,855 --> 00:04:58,957
Did you bleed on the carrots?

42
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:01,826
Really, Mom?

43
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,894
Will I die?

44
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,696
Yeah, probably.

45
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,731
Give it.

46
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,800
- Oh, Mom!
- Oh, you'll be fine.

47
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:10,101
Did you rinse them first?

48
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:11,636
Yep, and the parsnips.

49
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,938
- Where are your brothers
- Uh, on the PlayStation.

50
00:05:13,972 --> 00:05:16,274
Bastards. They're supposed
to be in the bath.

51
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:18,243
We haven't got long, Mom.

52
00:05:18,278 --> 00:05:20,211
I know, darling.

53
00:05:20,245 --> 00:05:21,880
They'll be here soon.

54
00:05:21,914 --> 00:05:25,216
Oh, shit, I'm not
a fucking waitress.

55
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,918
Belinda's still in there.

56
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,920
She won't bloody leave.

57
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,255
Haven't made enough.

58
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,557
You sure your mother
wants them let out?

59
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:34,893
She thinks it's kinder if the
foxes get them first.

60
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:36,995
- Yeah, maybe.
- You promised you'd let me

61
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:38,763
light the fireworks later.

62
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,732
Yes, I said I would.

63
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:42,267
You look great.

64
00:05:42,302 --> 00:05:44,603
Ooh, ooh.

65
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,005
D...

66
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:50,542
Oh, shit, where are the boys?

67
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:52,043
Uh, on PlayStation.

68
00:05:52,077 --> 00:05:53,745
Bastards.

69
00:05:54,314 --> 00:05:56,848
- I could...
- Boys! Bath!

70
00:05:59,117 --> 00:06:01,586
You look perfect.

71
00:06:04,222 --> 00:06:06,124
I don't hear a lot of movement!

72
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,165
Come on, Belinda.
Be free and be brave.

73
00:06:21,307 --> 00:06:24,943
Oh, and remember no TV, okay?

74
00:06:24,977 --> 00:06:28,280
And no iPhones, no Googling,
and, for the love of God,

75
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:29,981
no arguing with Kitty.
I think she's annoying

76
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,749
but just make an effort,
all right?

77
00:06:31,783 --> 00:06:33,885
- She's a pain in the ass, Dad.
- Language, Thomas.

78
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,119
You said we could.

79
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:36,654
Yeah, I know,
but there's now need

80
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,189
to get carried away, chaps.
Come on.

81
00:06:38,223 --> 00:06:40,258
Is Kitty allowed to swear?

82
00:06:40,293 --> 00:06:41,793
Probably.

83
00:06:41,827 --> 00:06:43,362
You said everyone
was allowed to swear.

84
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:44,829
Yeah, I did.

85
00:06:46,898 --> 00:06:50,268
Oh, Jesus, they're early.

86
00:06:50,303 --> 00:06:51,970
This is important.

87
00:06:52,004 --> 00:06:54,706
Don't drown.
How do I look good?

88
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,840
- Good.
- Good.

89
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,376
That's why I love you.

90
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,312
Right, it's not time
for a soak, so hurry up, chaps.

91
00:07:14,126 --> 00:07:16,628
Oh, fuck. Sing to me.

92
00:07:16,662 --> 00:07:18,597
Yes, darling?

93
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,133
They're beautiful. Thank you.

94
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:23,901
Sandra picked them from
the neighbor's garden.

95
00:07:23,935 --> 00:07:25,337
It didn't take her very long.

96
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:26,771
Oh, okay, lovely.

97
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:28,973
- Ah, Kitty.
- Is the sticky toffee

98
00:07:29,007 --> 00:07:31,075
pudding ready?

99
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:34,279
Sandra promised that there
would be sticky toffee pudding.

100
00:07:34,313 --> 00:07:35,381
Yes, absolutely.

101
00:07:35,415 --> 00:07:37,383
Where's Art?

102
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:39,217
Uh...

103
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,818
♪ Da-da-da-da-da-da ♪

104
00:07:40,852 --> 00:07:42,020
Wow.

105
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:43,821
Kitty's university fund.

106
00:07:43,855 --> 00:07:45,823
Oh, why didn't I think of that?

107
00:07:45,857 --> 00:07:47,225
You did saved me your old room?

108
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,260
Fucking sticky toffee pudding,
I forgot.

109
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:50,995
- Oh, no, fuck.
- Sorry.

110
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:54,065
She's gonna kill me. Tony!

111
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,100
Tony?

112
00:07:56,134 --> 00:07:59,270
- Tony.
- Yes, mother?

113
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:01,773
Nell forgot toffee.

114
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:03,107
- Oh, crumbs.
- What?

115
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:05,411
Kidding. Your mom's kidding.
Come on.

116
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:06,844
Let's find Art.

117
00:08:06,878 --> 00:08:08,246
Go to the garage, darling.

118
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:10,948
There's a Tesco drive-in
right down the road.

119
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:12,250
What if it's shut?

120
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:13,885
Find a mallet.
Break a fucking window!

121
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,421
- I don't know.
- I suppose so.

122
00:08:15,455 --> 00:08:17,322
- Simon, have you got a mallet?
- What?

123
00:08:17,356 --> 00:08:19,358
Simon?

124
00:08:19,392 --> 00:08:20,959
Art?

125
00:08:25,465 --> 00:08:27,699
Art?

126
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:30,268
You need a hand, darling?

127
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:32,203
Um, yeah, actually.

128
00:08:32,237 --> 00:08:35,139
If you could just
grab one and wait.

129
00:08:35,173 --> 00:08:36,274
All right.

130
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:37,476
Oh!

131
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,110
Mm!

132
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:42,113
Oh.

133
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,981
Darling.

134
00:08:44,015 --> 00:08:45,783
You look impossibly
beautiful as ever.

135
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,319
Thank you, my love.

136
00:08:47,353 --> 00:08:51,356
Where's Sandra? I want room
before she nabs it.

137
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,292
Oh.

138
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:54,759
- What?!
- I know.

139
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:55,860
- Oh.
- I know, I know.

140
00:08:55,894 --> 00:08:56,994
Oh, my God.

141
00:08:57,028 --> 00:08:58,930
Oh, Alex didn't have to pay.

142
00:08:58,964 --> 00:09:01,099
We had a rather regretful
exchange with an Arab lady

143
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:03,167
and her surprisingly
fierce bodyguard.

144
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:05,304
- Oh, happened?!
- Oh, yeah, Alex got caught

145
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:06,305
in the crossfire.

146
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:07,739
It was very un-PC of me,

147
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:10,775
smacking a lady in a burqa.

148
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:12,176
Does it hurt?

149
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,011
Um, yeah, it does.

150
00:09:14,045 --> 00:09:15,780
Does it?

151
00:09:15,814 --> 00:09:17,416
- Why did you say something?
- I did.

152
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,451
Oh, God. Is Kitty here?

153
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:21,487
With a bow in her hair.

154
00:09:21,521 --> 00:09:23,988
Slightly hoping they'd
put her down already.

155
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,524
Behave.

156
00:09:25,558 --> 00:09:27,426
Remember, tonight is
all about love and forgiveness.

157
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,295
Oh, exciting.
Who are we forgiving?

158
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:32,897
Ourselves, of course.

159
00:09:32,931 --> 00:09:34,999
Oh, yeah.

160
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,902
Oh, thank you
for coming, sweetheart.

161
00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:39,904
I don't know what we would
have done without Bella.

162
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:41,340
Mind you, she's very naughty.

163
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:43,808
She should have
stolen something for you, too.

164
00:09:46,512 --> 00:09:48,347
Art?

165
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:57,822
- Hi.
- What the fuck?

166
00:09:57,856 --> 00:09:59,324
Get the fuck out, Kitty.

167
00:09:59,358 --> 00:10:01,460
Nope. I want to watch.

168
00:10:01,494 --> 00:10:04,463
My mother said since tonight is
a special occasion,

169
00:10:04,497 --> 00:10:06,465
you have to be
especially nice to me.

170
00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:09,167
- No fucking way.
- Swearing is common.

171
00:10:09,201 --> 00:10:12,371
- Out mom swears.
- Exactly.

172
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:14,071
- What's going on?
- They made me.

173
00:10:14,105 --> 00:10:15,541
- No, we didn't.
- No, we didn't.

174
00:10:15,575 --> 00:10:17,875
Shut the fuck up, Kitty.
We all know you're full of shit.

175
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,511
- Excuse me?
- I said shut the fuck up.

176
00:10:19,545 --> 00:10:22,080
Mum!

177
00:10:28,454 --> 00:10:30,888
Are you coping, darling?
Yes?

178
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,957
Yeah, just.

179
00:10:32,991 --> 00:10:34,225
The boys upset?

180
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,827
Uh, well, they will be

181
00:10:35,861 --> 00:10:37,396
when they see
I don't have enough potatoes.

182
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,963
You're worried about potatoes?

183
00:10:38,997 --> 00:10:42,501
Yes. Waitrose was empty,
and James eats a lot.

184
00:10:42,535 --> 00:10:44,836
Well, Sophie doesn't.

185
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,103
God, how's she do it?

186
00:10:46,137 --> 00:10:47,539
Remember how hard we tried?

187
00:10:47,573 --> 00:10:49,207
Coke helped,
and then the kids came.

188
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:50,609
It was kids or coke.

189
00:10:50,643 --> 00:10:52,243
You wanted to be anorexic?

190
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:55,847
She looked great.
You looked great.

191
00:10:55,881 --> 00:10:58,082
Sandra wants me
to apologize to Kitty.

192
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,551
Did you call her a cunt?

193
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:01,185
Because we said that
that word was out of bounds.

194
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:02,354
You should have done.

195
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:05,056
Art! Apologize.

196
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,159
It's Christmas, darling.
What would baby Jesus say?

197
00:11:09,662 --> 00:11:11,463
You're joking, right?

198
00:11:19,438 --> 00:11:20,905
Sorry, Kitty.

199
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:22,608
Good boy, Art.
You're such a good boy.

200
00:11:22,642 --> 00:11:24,276
You just called me an asshole.

201
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,244
Well, you can be.

202
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:29,981
- What, I...
- Sorry.

203
00:11:30,015 --> 00:11:34,151
All right, all right, come on,
piss off, piss off.

204
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:35,654
That doesn't mean you won, okay?

205
00:11:35,688 --> 00:11:38,923
Just little stripper.
Look at this.

206
00:11:38,957 --> 00:11:40,559
Oh, I took Nell's room.

207
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:43,027
You don't mind, do you?

208
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:44,463
Fine.

209
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,433
Oh, can I have
sparkling water, please?

210
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:51,437
Oh, shit, yes, sorry.
Of course. Um...

211
00:11:56,609 --> 00:11:58,344
Fanta.

212
00:12:00,446 --> 00:12:02,079
You like Fanta, darling.

213
00:12:02,113 --> 00:12:04,181
Do I?

214
00:12:04,215 --> 00:12:07,352
I'm so sorry. All of the water
was gone, even the shit stuff.

215
00:12:07,386 --> 00:12:09,455
Did Lizzy call?

216
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:13,925
I thought Lizzy was coming.

217
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:15,560
Bella, you said Lizzy
was coming.

218
00:12:15,594 --> 00:12:18,029
Bella?

219
00:12:19,632 --> 00:12:21,433
- Did you invite her?
- Did you?

220
00:12:21,467 --> 00:12:25,002
Yes, I said,
"Don't forget to call Lizzy."

221
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,606
No, no, you did not.
You said you would call Lizzy.

222
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,143
Why would I call her?
I don't like her.

223
00:12:32,177 --> 00:12:34,546
Don't you?

224
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,080
I've never liked her.

225
00:12:36,114 --> 00:12:37,516
No, she hasn't.

226
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,951
Doesn't mean I want her
to be alone, though,

227
00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:41,453
Fuck.

228
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:43,355
I would have put up with her.

229
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:44,723
I really like Lizzy.

230
00:12:44,757 --> 00:12:47,659
And that is why I love you,
darling.

231
00:12:47,693 --> 00:12:51,430
Always so generous.

232
00:12:51,464 --> 00:12:53,998
Every inch of you, generous.

233
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:58,069
Do you guys have a lot of sex?

234
00:12:58,103 --> 00:13:01,005
Yeah, loads. Fucking loads,

235
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,341
Don't we?

236
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,444
- Exhausting.
- God, exhausting.

237
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:13,217
- Just give me one sec.
- You sure?

238
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,453
I'll meet you in there, yeah.

239
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:16,253
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Just one second.

240
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:18,122
Okay.

241
00:13:22,193 --> 00:13:23,428
Nell!

242
00:13:23,462 --> 00:13:26,263
- Oh, James!
- Smells gorgeous in here.

243
00:13:26,298 --> 00:13:28,333
- Oh, thank you.
- You look amazing.

244
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:31,235
Do I? I don't look old?
God, we're all getting old.

245
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:32,537
We were getting old.

246
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,272
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, Sophie!

247
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:37,642
I didn't see you.
Oh, let me take this.

248
00:13:37,676 --> 00:13:39,511
God, come in.
You must be freezing.

249
00:13:39,545 --> 00:13:41,780
Why?
Oh, don't bother.

250
00:13:41,814 --> 00:13:44,015
James told me you all
think I'm anorexic.

251
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:47,151
- James, no we don't!
- Yes, we do, darling.

252
00:13:47,185 --> 00:13:48,353
Hi, Sandra.

253
00:13:48,387 --> 00:13:50,622
Oh. How old are you again?

254
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:52,491
You asked me that last time.

255
00:13:52,525 --> 00:13:55,159
- Oh, did I?
- Yes.

256
00:13:55,193 --> 00:13:57,529
- Ah!
- Sandra.

257
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:03,702
Charming.

258
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:05,704
Uh, let him go, sweetheart.

259
00:14:05,738 --> 00:14:07,606
Oh, do I have to?

260
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,241
Uh, is Kitty here?

261
00:14:10,276 --> 00:14:13,312
Of course. She couldn't exactly
leave her at home, could she?

262
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,180
- No.
- No.

263
00:14:16,214 --> 00:14:17,582
No, no, of course not,

264
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:19,518
especially because
we made a pact.

265
00:14:19,552 --> 00:14:23,722
- I didn't make a pact.
- Oh, we did.

266
00:14:23,756 --> 00:14:26,591
Uh, tonight is all
about truth and love.

267
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,259
And, you know,
you're with James,

268
00:14:28,294 --> 00:14:30,295
so that counts as making
a pact, right, darling?

269
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:33,064
Fuck. Where's Lizzy?

270
00:14:47,646 --> 00:14:49,815
Come on, pooch.

271
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:51,516
We make tremendous criminals.

272
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,452
That felt so bloody good.

273
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:55,420
- Tony? Tony?
- Yes, my love?

274
00:14:55,454 --> 00:14:58,089
Oh, you got them. Excellent!
Well done!

275
00:14:58,123 --> 00:15:01,326
Pass them over.
James and Sophie are fighting.

276
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,461
James and Sophie are fighting.

277
00:15:02,495 --> 00:15:04,162
Ooh.

278
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,432
You haven't.
You haven't told them?

279
00:15:07,466 --> 00:15:09,868
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

280
00:15:09,902 --> 00:15:11,303
Shh.

281
00:15:11,337 --> 00:15:13,204
Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

282
00:15:13,238 --> 00:15:15,272
How old is she again?

283
00:15:15,307 --> 00:15:17,375
- 15.
- She can't be 15.

284
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:19,544
Okay, 20.

285
00:15:19,578 --> 00:15:21,346
How am I supposed to feel?

286
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,648
Are you ashamed?

287
00:15:23,682 --> 00:15:26,217
Why would I be ashamed?

288
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:28,753
- Is it like a posh thing?
- What? No.

289
00:15:28,787 --> 00:15:30,889
I've just noticed posh people
like to keep secrets.

290
00:15:30,923 --> 00:15:34,225
It's... it's depressing.

291
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:35,527
It's depressing?

292
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:38,530
I mean, it's painful for them.

293
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:40,832
They don't have a choice,
Sophie.

294
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:42,567
- Yes, they do.
- They don't.

295
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:44,135
Well, they do.

296
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:46,304
They don't,
and they wouldn't understand.

297
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:48,206
What wouldn't we understand?

298
00:15:50,376 --> 00:15:52,209
Trivial pursuits.

299
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,480
You are unbelievably bad
at the geography questions.

300
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:57,516
So I didn't bring it because
I didn't want to embarrass you.

301
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,584
But I'm really fucking good.
at articulate.

302
00:15:59,618 --> 00:16:01,319
Alright, show me.

303
00:16:01,353 --> 00:16:02,921
- Salt and pepper?
- Ah, salt and pepper.

304
00:16:02,955 --> 00:16:05,222
Here, yes, and spoons, yes.

305
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,593
And yeah, spoons.

306
00:16:10,563 --> 00:16:12,497
Thank you.

307
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:14,367
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

308
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:20,572
- Merry Christmas.
- Happy Christmas

309
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:24,442
At least we won't have to
play trivial pursuits, right?

310
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:26,512
Oh, are we not?

311
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:20,999
Oh, marvelous.

312
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:25,403
It's just one potato each.
I'm really sorry.

313
00:17:25,437 --> 00:17:26,504
It's just one for everyone?

314
00:17:26,538 --> 00:17:28,407
Yes.

315
00:17:31,277 --> 00:17:32,577
What, so just half for the boys?

316
00:17:32,611 --> 00:17:33,945
There's one,
there's one for everyone.

317
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:35,981
- They're half our size.
- One.

318
00:17:38,384 --> 00:17:39,918
Mm.

319
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,492
Real crunchy.

320
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:49,961
- Shall we say, Grace?
- What a good idea.

321
00:17:49,995 --> 00:17:51,563
- What a good idea.
- Yes!

322
00:17:51,597 --> 00:17:53,431
- Lovely, lovely.
- Good idea.

323
00:17:53,465 --> 00:17:54,967
Right.

324
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:59,938
- Simon?
- Sure. Um...

325
00:17:59,972 --> 00:18:01,773
Where to start? Uh...

326
00:18:01,807 --> 00:18:02,974
God.

327
00:18:03,008 --> 00:18:05,677
God, yes, dear God.

328
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:09,648
May we thank you
for my wife's culinary talents?

329
00:18:09,682 --> 00:18:11,049
- Mm-hmm.
- Um...

330
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,720
Also an important, uh...

331
00:18:15,988 --> 00:18:18,923
Um...

332
00:18:18,957 --> 00:18:20,625
For our beautiful friends,

333
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:22,727
Yes.

334
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:25,330
For our beautiful children

335
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:27,666
And for the food on our table,

336
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,935
for the lives that we've shared.

337
00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:33,772
For...

338
00:18:33,806 --> 00:18:36,708
Oh, for, uh...

339
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:38,777
the promise of love.

340
00:18:38,811 --> 00:18:40,412
And happiness

341
00:18:40,446 --> 00:18:42,781
And health and safety,
health and safety.

342
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,684
In your in your beautiful,
really beautiful...

343
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:47,752
Fun! Let's not forget how fun
it's going to be up there.

344
00:18:47,786 --> 00:18:51,556
In your in your fun,
beautiful, safe...

345
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,658
Kingdom. Amen.

346
00:18:53,692 --> 00:18:54,793
- Amen.
- Amen.

347
00:18:54,827 --> 00:18:56,027
- Amen.
- Amen!

348
00:18:56,061 --> 00:18:57,629
- Let's eat.
- Alright.

349
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,799
- Crack on, everyone.
- Yummy.

350
00:19:03,135 --> 00:19:05,403
- I...
- Where is the gravy?

351
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:09,107
- Here comes the gravy boat.
- Lovely.

352
00:19:12,578 --> 00:19:14,646
- Delicious, darling.
- Really lovely.

353
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,014
- Terrific.
- Really, really good.

354
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:17,582
Did anyone watch
the Queen's speech?

355
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:19,050
- Didn't see it myself.
- Well, she's clearly

356
00:19:19,084 --> 00:19:20,752
in some bunker set up, you know?

357
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:23,355
Filled with tins
of baked beans and dog food.

358
00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:25,790
- Oh.
- Absolutely.

359
00:19:25,824 --> 00:19:29,494
No. Who'd want to live in a hole
and eat dog food for 100 years?

360
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:32,130
Dog food for
the, uh, dogs, darling.

361
00:19:32,164 --> 00:19:34,966
Oh. Sorry.

362
00:19:37,536 --> 00:19:39,804
Knock yourselves out, boys.

363
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:42,474
I don't think she's in
a hole with dog food.

364
00:19:42,508 --> 00:19:43,942
I mean, I heard her.
She sounded sad.

365
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:47,846
She's an old woman,
so it's fine.

366
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,648
Excuse me?

367
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:53,551
Who said it's fine
because she's old?

368
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:54,919
Oh, come on, Sophie.
You know what she means.

369
00:19:54,953 --> 00:19:57,722
You mean that old people
don't matter

370
00:19:57,756 --> 00:20:00,425
because they've had their time,
so now they can die?

371
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:04,162
Darling. What's going on?

372
00:20:04,196 --> 00:20:05,964
I just don't think we should
teach our children

373
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:07,599
that old people don't matter.

374
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:09,501
Our children.

375
00:20:09,535 --> 00:20:11,870
Maybe Kitty didn't
quite mean it...

376
00:20:11,904 --> 00:20:14,139
- Oh, you wouldn't understand.
- What wouldn't she understand?

377
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:16,040
Well, you're not parents.

378
00:20:16,074 --> 00:20:18,042
Oh, of course, of course.
Sorry, I forgot.

379
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:19,677
Darling, were psychopaths
because we've never

380
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:21,479
- given birth.
- Of course you're not.

381
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:23,515
Sandra, just...

382
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:26,050
Let's just leave it.
Just leave it.

383
00:20:26,084 --> 00:20:28,052
I mean,
how do we measure life

384
00:20:28,086 --> 00:20:29,821
and who's worth what?

385
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,991
Well, I'm worth nothing.
Completely broke. Not a bean.

386
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:36,661
Sorry, darling.
I know what you meant.

387
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,830
Please, let's not fight.

388
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:40,565
Especially not before
the sticky toffee pudding.

389
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:42,534
Right, Kitty?

390
00:20:42,568 --> 00:20:44,436
Sorry, what is this all about?

391
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,570
Did someone upset you,
darling?

392
00:20:45,604 --> 00:20:47,172
Sorry, I'm sorry.

393
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:50,775
Sophie had a difficult night
last night, didn't you, darling?

394
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:54,679
- Tell us.
- Please don't, Sophie.

395
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:59,451
It was horrible.

396
00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:01,152
How was it horrible?

397
00:21:01,186 --> 00:21:03,888
Darling, I don't think
right now is the time to share.

398
00:21:03,922 --> 00:21:05,824
We had dinner.

399
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:08,927
We sang Celine Dion songs.

400
00:21:08,961 --> 00:21:13,765
And... and we danced to Britney.

401
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,000
We laughed.

402
00:21:16,034 --> 00:21:20,004
And we cried and said
that we loved each other.

403
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:21,773
- That sounds perfect.
- I wanted to be there

404
00:21:21,807 --> 00:21:24,976
and... and be
a witness for them.

405
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,579
Maybe it sounds stupid,
but I wanted them to know

406
00:21:27,613 --> 00:21:28,980
- that... that...
- Yeah, okay.

407
00:21:29,014 --> 00:21:30,748
- Okay, well done, Sophie.
- Somebody that they loved

408
00:21:30,782 --> 00:21:33,151
- and trusted would witness...
- Very honorable.

409
00:21:33,185 --> 00:21:36,020
Uh, while I'm up,
I have an announcement,

410
00:21:36,054 --> 00:21:38,156
and that is for those that
have room,

411
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,659
there is a delectable
cheese plate.

412
00:21:43,128 --> 00:21:45,230
But, uh also,
I think it's time for us

413
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:48,467
to raise a glass to the chef.

414
00:21:50,002 --> 00:21:52,837
To my wife. Love of my life.

415
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:54,939
- Nell!
- To Nell!

416
00:21:57,142 --> 00:21:59,944
- Merry Christmas.
- Cheers!

417
00:21:59,978 --> 00:22:02,614
I just think we should be honest
with the kids, that's all.

418
00:22:02,648 --> 00:22:04,249
Jesus Christ.

419
00:22:08,253 --> 00:22:12,223
Mum hasn't lied to us,
and we've seen the news.

420
00:22:12,257 --> 00:22:13,791
When?

421
00:22:13,825 --> 00:22:15,693
We know the Russians
want us all dead.

422
00:22:15,727 --> 00:22:17,996
They're sending poisonous gas
to kill us all in the morning.

423
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,731
- The Russians?
- What?

424
00:22:19,765 --> 00:22:22,800
Yeah, they're obsessed
with world domination.

425
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:25,103
Don't be ridiculous, Kitty.
It's not the Russians.

426
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:27,805
- It's a planet, Kitty.
- It's very upset.

427
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,707
Kitty, for years,
the planet's absorbed

428
00:22:29,741 --> 00:22:32,010
everyone's filthy rubbish,
and it's had enough.

429
00:22:32,044 --> 00:22:34,579
It can't take it anymore,
so it's spitting it back out

430
00:22:34,613 --> 00:22:36,047
as a "fuck you" to the world,

431
00:22:36,081 --> 00:22:38,116
- That's right, Kitty.
- We've taken the earth

432
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,184
for granted, haven't we, Dad?

433
00:22:40,218 --> 00:22:41,920
Mm-hmm.

434
00:22:41,954 --> 00:22:43,988
Nonsense. It's
the Russians sending the gas.

435
00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:45,790
You can't always blame
the fucking Russians, Kitty!

436
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:47,725
- Dad, tell Art.
- Look, Kitty.

437
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:49,827
Greta warned us.
She missed all that school.

438
00:22:49,861 --> 00:22:51,896
She spent weeks seasick.

439
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,998
She even met Leonardo DiCaprio.

440
00:22:54,032 --> 00:22:56,935
And still, no one
listened to her.

441
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:00,171
Sorry.

442
00:23:00,205 --> 00:23:02,774
You should all be ashamed
of yourselves.

443
00:23:06,745 --> 00:23:09,047
You are such clever,
clever boys.

444
00:23:09,081 --> 00:23:10,782
- I'm clever, too.
- Yes, you are, my darling.

445
00:23:10,816 --> 00:23:13,151
- It's a fucking mess.
- Stop swearing.

446
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:14,953
- No!
- Look, Art.

447
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:17,255
It's not all bad.
We're still luckier than some.

448
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,990
Aren't we, Dad?

449
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:20,858
At least our government
doesn't want us to suffer.

450
00:23:20,892 --> 00:23:22,794
You mean like those poor
African kids who slowly

451
00:23:22,828 --> 00:23:25,763
bled to death, puking out their
guts as the intestines turned

452
00:23:25,797 --> 00:23:28,300
to bloody mush?
You mean like them?

453
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:32,338
Yes, because my guts are going
to turn to bloody mush.

454
00:23:32,372 --> 00:23:34,272
How do you know?

455
00:23:34,307 --> 00:23:37,008
Art, stop it, please.

456
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:39,043
It's true, Art. Kitty's right.

457
00:23:39,077 --> 00:23:41,846
At least our government
has a plan.

458
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,983
It's not a plan,
it's a disaster.

459
00:24:04,303 --> 00:24:07,905
Stage one...
toxic inhalation.

460
00:24:07,939 --> 00:24:12,777
Stage two... attack
on the nervous system.

461
00:24:12,811 --> 00:24:16,948
Stage three...
fatal hemorrhaging.

462
00:24:16,982 --> 00:24:19,150
Take your exit pill,

463
00:24:19,184 --> 00:24:23,121
avoid suffering,
and die with dignity.

464
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,126
Everyone's life matters.

465
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,662
We just want to make sure
that you understand

466
00:24:30,696 --> 00:24:33,998
that as your parents,
we are not to blame.

467
00:24:34,032 --> 00:24:36,934
This is not our choice,
and this is not our fault.

468
00:24:36,968 --> 00:24:38,870
I mean, clearly, it's not
your fault, either.

469
00:24:38,904 --> 00:24:40,439
It's...

470
00:24:40,473 --> 00:24:45,043
But we are not responsible
for the poison, the pills...

471
00:24:45,077 --> 00:24:48,713
We're just trying to do what is
best for us all,

472
00:24:48,747 --> 00:24:52,050
uh, to protect you
so that, um...

473
00:24:52,084 --> 00:24:54,986
so that you don't suffer
because suffering is bad.

474
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:58,056
And in this case,
completely unnecessary.

475
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,691
Yeah.

476
00:24:59,725 --> 00:25:02,160
We all deserve to live,
especially old people.

477
00:25:02,194 --> 00:25:03,995
Yeah.

478
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:05,897
And we know that
this is the right thing to do.

479
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:07,131
- Yes.
- Don't we?

480
00:25:07,165 --> 00:25:10,035
- Yes.
- Yeah.

481
00:25:11,069 --> 00:25:13,372
And we love you very much.

482
00:25:13,406 --> 00:25:15,807
We love you very much.

483
00:25:16,842 --> 00:25:18,877
You know that
we love you, right?

484
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,685
Yeah, I suppose so.

485
00:25:28,887 --> 00:25:31,122
Yes, Sandra, I think so.

486
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:33,825
- Yes, mom.
- Yes, mom, we know.

487
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:40,065
- Sticky toffee pudding!
- Sticky toffee pudding!

488
00:25:40,766 --> 00:25:41,799
Oh!

489
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,901
Mm.

490
00:25:43,935 --> 00:25:46,338
Oh.

491
00:25:46,372 --> 00:25:48,340
Ugh.

492
00:25:51,076 --> 00:25:52,744
- Debbie Does Dallas.
- George, George.

493
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,348
- Wa... wa... wavy woman.
- "The Wizard of Oz"?

494
00:25:56,382 --> 00:25:58,216
"The Wizard of Oz"!
"The Wizard of Oz"!

495
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,519
- Oh, "The Snowman"!
- Four words, dummy!

496
00:26:00,553 --> 00:26:03,322
The snowman comes to tea.

497
00:26:03,356 --> 00:26:06,057
- Exotic dancer.
- Is it a Demi Moore film?

498
00:26:06,091 --> 00:26:09,461
- "Die Hard: Die Harder."
- "Black Swan"!

499
00:26:09,495 --> 00:26:11,363
Fucking hell, four words.

500
00:26:13,466 --> 00:26:15,800
That is exactly how she looked
when she gave birth

501
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:17,436
to the twins.

502
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,271
- "Bambi"?
- "Fantastic Mr. Fox."

503
00:26:20,306 --> 00:26:21,906
- Things are looking up.
- "The Fox and the Hound"?

504
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,942
Give us a clue. Sounds like?

505
00:26:24,976 --> 00:26:26,545
Oh, "The Day After Tomorrow"!

506
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:27,879
- Yes!
- Yes!

507
00:26:27,913 --> 00:26:29,515
- How?
- Are you kidding me?

508
00:26:34,085 --> 00:26:36,220
Fuck me, Batman.

509
00:26:36,254 --> 00:26:38,189
Did you get that
from the hospital?

510
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:46,898
Were you when the...
for the patients to see?

511
00:26:46,932 --> 00:26:48,800
Hm.

512
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,476
I'll admit it.

513
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,445
I'm scared.

514
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:11,456
- Sophie's pregnant.
- Oh, that's terrific.

515
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,224
- James, no.
- Didn't exactly plan it.

516
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:16,093
- What, the poison?
- No, the baby, Tony.

517
00:27:16,127 --> 00:27:18,262
- Is it a baby?
- How many weeks?

518
00:27:18,297 --> 00:27:21,199
Still early days.

519
00:27:21,233 --> 00:27:23,067
She hasn't decided yet.

520
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:25,870
On having the baby?

521
00:27:25,904 --> 00:27:29,341
The pill, Tony. She hasn't
decided about the pill. Right?

522
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:30,842
Mm.

523
00:27:30,876 --> 00:27:32,043
Are you insane?

524
00:27:32,077 --> 00:27:33,278
She has a choice.

525
00:27:33,312 --> 00:27:34,313
No, she doesn't.

526
00:27:34,347 --> 00:27:36,348
What do you mean?

527
00:27:36,382 --> 00:27:39,284
We made a pact.

528
00:27:39,318 --> 00:27:41,386
You understand,
we don't have a choice.

529
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,590
I do. But she does.

530
00:27:44,624 --> 00:27:46,123
Why wouldn't she?

531
00:27:46,157 --> 00:27:47,459
Doesn't want to hurt the baby.

532
00:27:47,493 --> 00:27:49,595
- It's insensitive.
- It's not the same.

533
00:27:49,629 --> 00:27:51,062
Or is us killing our kids.

534
00:27:51,096 --> 00:27:52,497
We're not killing our kids.

535
00:27:52,531 --> 00:27:54,567
Tony.

536
00:27:55,934 --> 00:27:59,405
No, you're right, you're right.
It's very different.

537
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,543
There's no escaping poison.

538
00:28:04,577 --> 00:28:06,244
- I know.
- Leave it, Tony.

539
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:08,547
Unless she's some sort
of fucking superwoman.

540
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:11,550
Don't be insulting.

541
00:28:11,584 --> 00:28:15,287
Can't change her mind.
Believe me, I've tried.

542
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:17,456
Can't fucking make her.

543
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,224
Yes, well, don't tell Sandra.
She'll kill her.

544
00:28:20,258 --> 00:28:22,994
Not literally.

545
00:28:23,028 --> 00:28:24,529
James.

546
00:28:24,563 --> 00:28:29,166
Sophie has to keep
this to herself.

547
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,639
It won't help telling the kids.
They won't understand.

548
00:28:33,673 --> 00:28:36,173
Can't protect them, James.

549
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:39,311
- I know.
- Do you?

550
00:28:39,345 --> 00:28:41,112
Yes.

551
00:28:43,683 --> 00:28:45,618
Sorry, James.

552
00:28:47,953 --> 00:28:50,054
You'd have been
such a great father.

553
00:28:52,425 --> 00:28:54,926
Shit balls.

554
00:29:03,703 --> 00:29:05,570
Oh.

555
00:29:05,604 --> 00:29:08,172
- Oh.
- Yes.

556
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:10,309
Hey! Wow.

557
00:29:10,343 --> 00:29:12,109
- Look at her.
- Bravo.

558
00:29:12,143 --> 00:29:13,645
Daddy, she's beautiful!

559
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,348
And if you pull the string
on her back,

560
00:29:16,382 --> 00:29:18,283
she actually talks like you.

561
00:29:18,317 --> 00:29:20,184
- The doll talks like Kitty?
- Yeah.

562
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:23,488
You can upload an app.
It's actually quite cool.

563
00:29:23,522 --> 00:29:25,089
Oh.

564
00:29:25,123 --> 00:29:26,591
I love you, daddy.

565
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:30,061
You're the best daddy
in the whole wide world.

566
00:29:30,095 --> 00:29:32,163
Thank you, daddy!

567
00:29:32,197 --> 00:29:35,032
- Aw.
- Aw, I love you, sport.

568
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:36,301
- Aw!
- Aw!

569
00:29:36,335 --> 00:29:38,035
- So sweet.
- Thank you.

570
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:40,505
Oh, oh.

571
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:43,642
Don't I get a hug, darling?
Come on.

572
00:29:43,676 --> 00:29:45,277
No, thank you.

573
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:46,745
Why not?

574
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:49,315
Because you're wearing
my education on your feet.

575
00:29:51,584 --> 00:29:55,387
You don't need it anymore.
Just... just give me a hug.

576
00:29:55,421 --> 00:29:57,054
I'm not hugging you.

577
00:29:57,088 --> 00:30:00,726
Oh, darling,
I deserve a hug.

578
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,562
Nope.

579
00:30:03,596 --> 00:30:05,497
Well, just
a teensy-weensy,

580
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:08,734
ittle-bittle, teeny-weeny little
baby hug, darling?

581
00:30:08,768 --> 00:30:11,102
Drop it, Sandra.

582
00:30:11,136 --> 00:30:12,637
Tony, speak up.

583
00:30:12,671 --> 00:30:15,741
Just fucking... Jesus Christ,
just fucking hug your mum

584
00:30:15,775 --> 00:30:19,143
so we open the rest of these
stupid fucking presents

585
00:30:19,177 --> 00:30:22,280
before you should fucking
Russians kill us all.

586
00:30:22,314 --> 00:30:26,485
Oh. Well, best do what
Psycho says.

587
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:35,427
And what's with the stupid
fucking bow in her hair?

588
00:30:35,461 --> 00:30:38,297
All right, Art, don't take
the fucking piss.

589
00:30:42,334 --> 00:30:44,235
Does that mean
you don't want it, then?

590
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:46,204
Dibs on it first.

591
00:30:47,573 --> 00:30:50,342
- I'll go.
- I'll go.

592
00:30:50,376 --> 00:30:52,711
- Children.
- Love you.

593
00:30:52,745 --> 00:30:55,647
Don't approach anything without
the Prosecco.

594
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,585
- Just like you.
- I love you, Daddy.

595
00:31:00,619 --> 00:31:02,186
You're the best daddy
in the whole world.

596
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,489
Go on, boys. Have a go.

597
00:31:04,523 --> 00:31:06,691
- Okay, that's gonna...
- Wow, wow.

598
00:31:06,725 --> 00:31:09,160
- Give it back.
- I really want to hit her.

599
00:31:10,496 --> 00:31:13,732
No, no, you can't hit Kitty.

600
00:31:13,766 --> 00:31:15,600
Like it isn't cruel enough
to give us toys

601
00:31:15,634 --> 00:31:17,736
we can't even play with.

602
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,604
It's so wrong.

603
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:22,407
And so stupid.

604
00:31:22,441 --> 00:31:26,611
Do you mom know
you're actually stupid?

605
00:31:26,645 --> 00:31:29,548
Well, your mom's always been
a little bit daft.

606
00:31:32,618 --> 00:31:35,687
We just wanted you to be happy.

607
00:31:38,557 --> 00:31:41,326
The batteries are going
to last longer than us.

608
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:49,200
I'm so sorry, Art.

609
00:31:54,272 --> 00:31:57,543
Is it true that some people
haven't been given a pill?

610
00:32:01,514 --> 00:32:03,282
Who told you that?

611
00:32:05,684 --> 00:32:07,486
Just tell me the truth.

612
00:32:12,424 --> 00:32:14,493
Yes.

613
00:32:14,527 --> 00:32:18,797
Homeless people
and illegal immigrants.

614
00:32:18,831 --> 00:32:21,132
They won't have been
given the pill.

615
00:32:24,537 --> 00:32:27,506
Why?

616
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,374
Because...

617
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:33,812
according to the government,
they don't legally exist.

618
00:32:36,749 --> 00:32:39,551
Of course they do.

619
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:42,554
Not in their system, they don't.
It's complicated.

620
00:32:44,623 --> 00:32:48,192
That's wrong. They're going to
die horrible, horrible deaths.

621
00:32:50,362 --> 00:32:53,398
We have to help them.

622
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:55,767
Don't be ridiculous, Art.

623
00:32:55,801 --> 00:32:57,469
I'm not ridiculous.

624
00:32:57,503 --> 00:33:01,673
We can't even help ourselves.
All we can do is...

625
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:09,814
...take our pills
and choose not to suffer.

626
00:33:09,848 --> 00:33:11,449
We have a choice.

627
00:33:11,483 --> 00:33:13,752
No, no.

628
00:33:13,786 --> 00:33:17,322
We don't have a choice. No.

629
00:33:29,735 --> 00:33:32,737
Hang on, wind action.
Wind, wind, wind.

630
00:33:32,771 --> 00:33:34,673
Go, go, go, go, go!

631
00:33:34,707 --> 00:33:36,741
Okay.

632
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,920
Shh.

633
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:04,863
Shh.

634
00:35:04,897 --> 00:35:08,900
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, we had fun at school.

635
00:35:08,934 --> 00:35:10,802
Do you remember when
they had us clearing leaves

636
00:35:10,836 --> 00:35:12,070
from the bottom pitch?

637
00:35:12,104 --> 00:35:14,673
It took us days.
They just kept falling.

638
00:35:14,707 --> 00:35:16,608
You called the headmaster
a pervert.

639
00:35:16,642 --> 00:35:18,877
He accused me of stealing
Mars bars from the kitchen.

640
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:20,679
- But did you?
- Yes, of course.

641
00:35:20,713 --> 00:35:23,048
But what was he doing
following me into the kitchen

642
00:35:23,082 --> 00:35:24,683
in the middle of the night?

643
00:35:24,717 --> 00:35:27,686
Oh, I think we know why.
Yes, we did, dirty bugger.

644
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,487
Dirty bugger.

645
00:35:29,521 --> 00:35:32,724
I think I was trying
to do the same.

646
00:35:35,861 --> 00:35:37,996
Do you need a hand with that?

647
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,866
- She's fine.
- Me? No, I'm fine.

648
00:35:52,711 --> 00:35:54,479
Love Scrabble.

649
00:35:56,982 --> 00:35:59,751
Just to keep me company.

650
00:35:59,785 --> 00:36:02,821
Oh, I'm just so thirsty.

651
00:36:02,855 --> 00:36:05,056
Nell was
always the youngest.

652
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,491
No, I wasn't
the youngest, James was.

653
00:36:06,525 --> 00:36:08,960
- Yeah.
- Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

654
00:36:08,994 --> 00:36:11,630
Oh, you were so adorable.

655
00:36:13,065 --> 00:36:14,733
Bella was always the oldest.

656
00:36:16,602 --> 00:36:19,037
Anyone want to play
Scrabble with me?

657
00:36:19,071 --> 00:36:23,842
Yes, um, actually, Sandra didn't
talk to me till we were 15.

658
00:36:23,876 --> 00:36:25,577
Oh, come on.

659
00:36:25,611 --> 00:36:26,845
In fact, none of you did.

660
00:36:26,879 --> 00:36:28,146
That's 'cause you were
terribly boring.

661
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,115
Boring?

662
00:36:30,149 --> 00:36:31,783
I thought you loved me.

663
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:33,651
I was just very grateful
you didn't want scratch my back.

664
00:36:33,685 --> 00:36:35,687
Oh, you love having
your back scratched.

665
00:36:35,721 --> 00:36:38,156
With you, dear, yes.

666
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:41,426
And James arrived from Nigeria
with his school fees

667
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,627
and his suitcase.

668
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:44,429
- Mm.
- You were very African

669
00:36:44,463 --> 00:36:46,431
when you arrived.

670
00:36:47,933 --> 00:36:50,769
Come on, you sound like Mowgli
from "The Jungle Book."

671
00:36:50,803 --> 00:36:53,071
Didn't Mowgli have
an American accent?

672
00:36:53,105 --> 00:36:56,775
I think Mowgli's from India.

673
00:36:59,478 --> 00:37:01,413
How come you never fucked me?

674
00:37:01,447 --> 00:37:02,814
- Wow. Wow.
- Jesus, Sandra.

675
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:05,150
- I just was wondering.
- James, I'm so sorry.

676
00:37:05,184 --> 00:37:06,951
Please do not apologize
for me, darling.

677
00:37:06,985 --> 00:37:08,787
No, that's right. You should
probably apologize for yourself.

678
00:37:08,821 --> 00:37:10,488
Oh, keep your knickers on.

679
00:37:10,522 --> 00:37:12,190
You know, it's just something
that always bothered me.

680
00:37:12,224 --> 00:37:14,692
You know?
Everyone wanted to fuck me.

681
00:37:14,726 --> 00:37:16,694
I didn't.

682
00:37:16,728 --> 00:37:18,463
Why not?

683
00:37:18,497 --> 00:37:20,498
Just never really did it for me.

684
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:24,836
I never knew that.

685
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:27,138
- Did you know that, Nell?
- No.

686
00:37:27,172 --> 00:37:29,007
Did you know that
her husband didn't want

687
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:30,708
to have sex with you?

688
00:37:30,742 --> 00:37:34,145
Yes, because I just assumed
everyone did, okay?

689
00:37:34,179 --> 00:37:35,814
Stop being so judgy.

690
00:37:35,848 --> 00:37:37,715
It was hard not to be, actually.

691
00:37:37,749 --> 00:37:41,886
Oh, you fancy
Ms. Skinny Pants next door, hm?

692
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,690
Ms. Potato face?
Miss Americana? Hm?

693
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,794
Oh, come on, James.

694
00:37:49,828 --> 00:37:53,832
Don't go all shy on us now.

695
00:37:53,866 --> 00:37:55,767
I actually love Sophie.

696
00:37:55,801 --> 00:37:57,168
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

697
00:37:57,202 --> 00:37:59,070
Oh, don't worry about it.

698
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:03,641
- I'm sorry. I really...
- Hey, hey, hey.

699
00:38:03,675 --> 00:38:05,577
She's a good person.

700
00:38:07,746 --> 00:38:09,981
Oh, wow.

701
00:38:10,015 --> 00:38:14,152
Don't. Don't make me cruel.

702
00:38:14,186 --> 00:38:16,754
I don't want to be cruel to you.

703
00:38:16,788 --> 00:38:19,491
What is this, James,
Is it pity, hm?

704
00:38:19,525 --> 00:38:20,692
Do you know pity me?

705
00:38:20,726 --> 00:38:22,627
No one pities you, Sandra.

706
00:38:22,661 --> 00:38:23,962
They tolerate you,
but they don't pity you.

707
00:38:23,996 --> 00:38:25,663
How the fuck would you know?

708
00:38:25,697 --> 00:38:26,898
Calm down, Sandra.

709
00:38:26,932 --> 00:38:28,199
Piss off, Simon!

710
00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:30,134
Oh, God.

711
00:38:30,168 --> 00:38:31,936
When we heard about
what was going to happen

712
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:37,242
and I realized that I'd...
well, I'd never get to...

713
00:38:37,277 --> 00:38:40,712
- I'd never get to...
- Never get the fuck James?

714
00:38:40,746 --> 00:38:42,113
I get it.

715
00:38:42,147 --> 00:38:43,648
You want to fuck James, too?

716
00:38:43,682 --> 00:38:45,517
- No.
- Why not?

717
00:38:45,551 --> 00:38:47,785
- Looks exactly like James Bond.
- What are you talking about?

718
00:38:47,819 --> 00:38:49,254
- He does.
- I do.

719
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:54,526
I get it. You guys.
Fuck, you were best friends.

720
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:58,596
We're all going to die,
so you...

721
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,198
- Fuck, you might as well...
- Fuck James.

722
00:39:00,232 --> 00:39:05,637
Ask! Tony, might as well ask.

723
00:39:05,671 --> 00:39:09,607
Don't be simple, Tony.
This isn't about you and Sandra.

724
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:11,910
- Clearly.
- This is about before

725
00:39:11,944 --> 00:39:13,545
you and Sandra.

726
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:17,248
We were best friends,
and I loved you.

727
00:39:17,283 --> 00:39:19,017
I really, really loved you.

728
00:39:19,051 --> 00:39:20,251
I loved you, too.

729
00:39:20,286 --> 00:39:21,553
Great.

730
00:39:21,587 --> 00:39:24,756
But when Mr. Tanner...

731
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,792
When Mr Tanner, when he...

732
00:39:30,862 --> 00:39:32,664
I couldn't forgive you.

733
00:39:32,698 --> 00:39:36,734
And you didn't want to, I know
that, and he was a disgrace.

734
00:39:36,768 --> 00:39:38,202
I didn't understand.

735
00:39:38,236 --> 00:39:42,073
I felt rejected,
and I was consumed by jealousy.

736
00:39:42,107 --> 00:39:43,875
What are you talking about?

737
00:39:43,909 --> 00:39:46,611
He took you away from me,
and I hated you for that.

738
00:39:46,645 --> 00:39:47,979
What the fuck's
he talking about?

739
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:49,681
- And then I hated myself.
- Simon, what's going on?

740
00:39:49,715 --> 00:39:51,082
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

741
00:39:51,116 --> 00:39:55,086
- It's okay, James.
- I was wrong to blame you.

742
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,755
You were just a child.

743
00:39:57,789 --> 00:40:01,793
It's okay, Nell.
It's okay, right?

744
00:40:01,827 --> 00:40:04,662
No.

745
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:06,264
No, it's not okay.

746
00:40:06,299 --> 00:40:09,734
- No, I know. I was...
- Yes.

747
00:40:09,768 --> 00:40:11,903
- You were.
- Dear.

748
00:40:11,937 --> 00:40:13,305
Tony, darling, look...

749
00:40:13,339 --> 00:40:15,374
I'm sorry, Sandra.

750
00:40:15,408 --> 00:40:17,241
Tony darling isn't here.

751
00:40:17,276 --> 00:40:18,710
It wasn't James' fault.

752
00:40:18,744 --> 00:40:20,379
No.

753
00:40:20,413 --> 00:40:22,180
Of course it wasn't.

754
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:25,149
But you didn't do anything.

755
00:40:25,183 --> 00:40:27,151
Did you?

756
00:40:27,185 --> 00:40:31,856
And it slithered away
like a... like a...

757
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:36,060
Like some sort of coward.

758
00:40:36,094 --> 00:40:37,161
Tony.

759
00:40:37,195 --> 00:40:40,665
- Tony, darling.
- What?

760
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:42,634
Look, we've all done things
we regret.

761
00:40:42,668 --> 00:40:45,203
- What?
- Yes.

762
00:40:45,237 --> 00:40:46,804
Darling, haven't you ever
made a mistake?

763
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:48,873
No, I haven't. No, no.
Not of this magnitude.

764
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:50,174
- No? Never?
- No, I haven't.

765
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:51,276
- Surely.
- No.

766
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,710
- No?
- No, not once.

767
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:54,178
- Once?
- What are you talking about?

768
00:40:54,212 --> 00:40:57,048
- Darling, surely...
- I still have things to say.

769
00:40:57,082 --> 00:40:59,352
- What?
- Oh, fuck.

770
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:05,923
What?!

771
00:41:05,957 --> 00:41:08,327
Me and Tone.

772
00:41:08,361 --> 00:41:10,194
You had sex with Tony?!

773
00:41:11,763 --> 00:41:13,164
Years ago.

774
00:41:13,198 --> 00:41:15,700
I fucking hope so!

775
00:41:15,734 --> 00:41:18,337
- I told you.
- When?!

776
00:41:18,371 --> 00:41:21,039
Uh...

777
00:41:21,073 --> 00:41:23,375
Uh...

778
00:41:23,409 --> 00:41:27,879
I don't know, I can't remember,
but I remember telling you

779
00:41:27,913 --> 00:41:30,148
that I had done you
and Tony a favor.

780
00:41:30,182 --> 00:41:32,750
Fucking Tony was a favor?

781
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:35,253
Yes, Sandra.

782
00:41:35,288 --> 00:41:37,356
Actually rather heroic.

783
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:38,756
Heroic?

784
00:41:40,092 --> 00:41:41,726
What the fuck?

785
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,227
I was killing two birds
with one stone.

786
00:41:43,261 --> 00:41:46,164
I had to try shagging
a bloke and...

787
00:41:46,198 --> 00:41:47,999
Shut the fuck up.

788
00:41:48,033 --> 00:41:51,336
Why not be of service
to you both?

789
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:56,375
I was fundamentally

790
00:41:56,409 --> 00:42:01,413
instrumental in getting you
back together again.

791
00:42:01,447 --> 00:42:04,115
Mm.

792
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:05,850
Given the circumstances,

793
00:42:05,884 --> 00:42:08,454
sort of an act of
sacrificial love.

794
00:42:08,488 --> 00:42:10,822
Yes! yes!

795
00:42:10,856 --> 00:42:13,057
It is that. It fucking was!

796
00:42:13,091 --> 00:42:15,226
- Yeah, yeah.
- It was!

797
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,129
Right, Tony? Bella was just
trying to boost your ego.

798
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:20,765
- Didn't fucking work!
- Didn't fucking work!

799
00:42:22,234 --> 00:42:23,935
Okay. Okay.

800
00:42:23,969 --> 00:42:25,803
Here's to us.

801
00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:28,272
- May we rest in love.
- Yes! In love.

802
00:42:28,307 --> 00:42:29,807
In love. Come on.

803
00:42:29,841 --> 00:42:31,075
Come on, stand up.

804
00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:33,111
Come on, San, come on, Tone.

805
00:42:33,145 --> 00:42:34,946
- Come on. It's Christmas.
- Come on. Come on, come on.

806
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,081
There we go.

807
00:42:37,115 --> 00:42:38,517
All right.

808
00:42:38,551 --> 00:42:41,286
Oh, that was intense.

809
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,488
Tone, we okay?

810
00:42:42,522 --> 00:42:44,289
Yeah.

811
00:43:00,506 --> 00:43:03,442
These twisters are
a precursor to the cloud

812
00:43:03,476 --> 00:43:08,246
arriving and carry
poisonous gases.

813
00:43:08,281 --> 00:43:10,248
Avoid suffering.

814
00:43:10,283 --> 00:43:13,885
Take your exit pill
and die with dignity.

815
00:43:13,919 --> 00:43:15,820
Art, can I come in?

816
00:43:15,854 --> 00:43:17,822
Sure.

817
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,227
You okay?

818
00:43:23,261 --> 00:43:25,397
What are you doing?

819
00:43:32,572 --> 00:43:34,005
Please don't tell my dad.

820
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:35,974
No, I won't.

821
00:43:40,245 --> 00:43:41,979
I can't help it.

822
00:43:42,013 --> 00:43:44,182
I don't know what else to do.

823
00:43:44,216 --> 00:43:45,983
I understand.

824
00:43:46,017 --> 00:43:48,186
Art?

825
00:43:51,524 --> 00:43:54,526
Come on. Got to call Grandma.

826
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,961
- Cool, great.
- Yeah.

827
00:44:04,337 --> 00:44:07,238
This is typical
fucking Lizzy.

828
00:44:07,272 --> 00:44:09,874
She's not even here,
and she's ruining the vibe.

829
00:44:09,908 --> 00:44:11,343
Hi.
Yeah, you've reached Lizzy.

830
00:44:11,377 --> 00:44:12,877
Yeah, leave me a message!

831
00:44:15,348 --> 00:44:19,150
You are completely pissed.

832
00:44:19,184 --> 00:44:21,919
I'm fine.

833
00:44:21,953 --> 00:44:25,524
I'm fine. I just...
I need a little snooze.

834
00:44:25,558 --> 00:44:28,527
Oh, be careful.

835
00:44:28,561 --> 00:44:31,830
- Hey!
- Yeah, okay, okay.

836
00:44:36,034 --> 00:44:38,102
You promised me.

837
00:44:38,136 --> 00:44:40,004
I can't help it.

838
00:44:42,642 --> 00:44:44,041
They're so mean.

839
00:44:44,075 --> 00:44:45,577
Oh!

840
00:44:45,611 --> 00:44:47,144
Fucking hell.

841
00:44:47,178 --> 00:44:48,913
Oh.

842
00:44:50,616 --> 00:44:52,884
I miss my mom.

843
00:44:55,153 --> 00:44:57,088
Mm.

844
00:45:03,529 --> 00:45:06,532
Oh, God.

845
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,636
Alex is asleep.

846
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:11,969
Already?!

847
00:45:12,003 --> 00:45:14,071
No, no.

848
00:45:14,105 --> 00:45:17,041
Just drunk.

849
00:45:17,075 --> 00:45:20,211
Are we really going to die?

850
00:45:20,245 --> 00:45:22,414
I know I'm not brave.

851
00:45:22,448 --> 00:45:25,082
Um...

852
00:45:25,116 --> 00:45:27,452
can't even cope with a cold.

853
00:45:27,486 --> 00:45:30,322
But you believe the government?

854
00:45:30,356 --> 00:45:32,056
Oh, no.

855
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:34,158
They killed Diana.

856
00:45:34,192 --> 00:45:36,462
Shit.

857
00:45:37,195 --> 00:45:40,532
We've seen it everywhere
on the news.

858
00:45:40,566 --> 00:45:42,367
The unimaginable horrors

859
00:45:42,401 --> 00:45:44,235
that have happened
all over the world.

860
00:45:44,269 --> 00:45:46,438
I mean, you cannot
make this shit up.

861
00:45:46,472 --> 00:45:48,205
And I've seen the road.

862
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:53,077
And there is no fucking way
I am living like that.

863
00:45:53,111 --> 00:45:55,480
I can't do post-apocalyptic
monochrome.

864
00:45:55,514 --> 00:45:57,649
I've never seen it.
Should I?

865
00:45:57,683 --> 00:45:59,951
No, no.

866
00:45:59,985 --> 00:46:03,422
It's fucking miserable.

867
00:46:06,492 --> 00:46:09,093
Oh, poor Al. She wouldn't
cope on her own.

868
00:46:09,127 --> 00:46:13,097
She's far too fragile.
You know?

869
00:46:13,131 --> 00:46:15,634
Yeah.

870
00:46:15,668 --> 00:46:17,268
She is.

871
00:46:17,303 --> 00:46:22,006
Darling, can you see her
running away from zombies?

872
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,008
Not in a hurry. No.

873
00:46:26,412 --> 00:46:28,246
Oh.

874
00:46:30,248 --> 00:46:33,985
We should have all voted Green.

875
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:36,688
Fucking conservatives.

876
00:46:39,024 --> 00:46:40,559
- Hey!
- Grandma!

877
00:46:40,593 --> 00:46:43,127
Hello, boys.
Happy Christmas.

878
00:46:43,161 --> 00:46:44,396
You're still alive!

879
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:45,764
Yes, I think so.

880
00:46:45,798 --> 00:46:47,766
Grandma, is the Queen dead?

881
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,101
Oh, I don't know, darling.

882
00:46:50,135 --> 00:46:52,069
Is she in a bunker full
of dog food?

883
00:46:52,103 --> 00:46:54,171
Yes, quite possibly.

884
00:46:54,205 --> 00:46:57,409
She should be prepared to die
with the rest of her people.

885
00:46:57,443 --> 00:47:01,413
Oh, darling.
Are you having a bad night?

886
00:47:01,447 --> 00:47:03,648
Tony and Simon robbed
the petrol station.

887
00:47:03,682 --> 00:47:05,784
- Oh, what fun?
- Hmm.

888
00:47:05,818 --> 00:47:07,386
Kitty wanted
sticky toffee pudding.

889
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:09,354
Yes, excellent choice.

890
00:47:09,388 --> 00:47:11,088
Thanks for lending us
the house, mum.

891
00:47:11,122 --> 00:47:12,724
- Thank you so much.
- It's been so lovely

892
00:47:12,758 --> 00:47:14,091
to have everyone back together.

893
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:15,494
Just brilliant.

894
00:47:15,528 --> 00:47:17,161
We miss you, though.

895
00:47:17,195 --> 00:47:19,598
I wish you weren't so far away.

896
00:47:19,632 --> 00:47:23,034
Well, yes. Um, darling,
I best go. I...

897
00:47:23,068 --> 00:47:25,303
I've got to Zoom
the bridge girls.

898
00:47:25,337 --> 00:47:29,040
Mum, mum, please wait.

899
00:47:29,074 --> 00:47:31,042
Nellie, it's all right.

900
00:47:33,279 --> 00:47:36,482
Your father's up there
waiting for us all.

901
00:47:37,817 --> 00:47:40,386
He'll be so thrilled to see you.

902
00:47:43,622 --> 00:47:46,391
- Mom?
- Goodbye, my darling girl.

903
00:47:46,425 --> 00:47:49,728
- Mom, are you okay?
- Hang in there.

904
00:47:49,762 --> 00:47:52,230
Goodbye, Simon.

905
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,568
Grandma?

906
00:47:56,602 --> 00:47:58,704
Where did Grandma go?

907
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:02,307
I didn't event get to say
goodbye to her.

908
00:48:06,177 --> 00:48:07,178
Call her back.

909
00:48:07,212 --> 00:48:08,480
No, darling.

910
00:48:08,514 --> 00:48:10,549
I didn't get to say
goodbye to her!

911
00:48:15,153 --> 00:48:16,120
Please, Dad.

912
00:48:16,154 --> 00:48:18,323
No, boys. I'm sorry.

913
00:48:18,357 --> 00:48:21,092
Stop being such an asshole
and call her back!

914
00:48:21,126 --> 00:48:23,295
I said no, Art. That's it.

915
00:48:30,469 --> 00:48:33,137
Darling?

916
00:48:59,532 --> 00:49:01,299
My poor mother!

917
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:02,834
She's all alone!

918
00:49:02,868 --> 00:49:04,870
Darling.

919
00:49:11,176 --> 00:49:12,744
I need you, Nell.

920
00:49:19,919 --> 00:49:22,321
Come on.

921
00:49:25,824 --> 00:49:27,860
Come on.

922
00:49:29,662 --> 00:49:30,762
Dance with me.

923
00:50:43,535 --> 00:50:44,669
Can I come in?

924
00:50:44,703 --> 00:50:46,905
Of course you can.

925
00:50:58,951 --> 00:51:00,885
You're a... you're a a doctor,
right?

926
00:51:00,919 --> 00:51:02,420
A cancer doctor.

927
00:51:02,454 --> 00:51:04,856
Yes, I am.

928
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:07,959
So you know about death.

929
00:51:07,993 --> 00:51:09,795
Mm-hmm.

930
00:51:12,298 --> 00:51:14,433
I'm not going to take the pill.

931
00:51:19,505 --> 00:51:21,873
It won't hurt you, Art.

932
00:51:21,907 --> 00:51:24,309
Well, it will. It'll kill me.

933
00:51:25,577 --> 00:51:28,546
I mean, it's painless.

934
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,282
I'm not scared of pain.

935
00:51:30,316 --> 00:51:32,284
Oh, Art.

936
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:36,288
You don't know
anything about pain.

937
00:51:36,322 --> 00:51:39,291
I know don't want to die.

938
00:51:39,325 --> 00:51:41,359
Pain...

939
00:51:41,393 --> 00:51:44,896
Pain is... intolerable.

940
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:48,600
Pain is why some people
choose to die.

941
00:51:48,634 --> 00:51:52,070
Well, I don't care,
I'm not taking it.

942
00:51:52,104 --> 00:51:54,673
Okay. Okay.

943
00:51:54,707 --> 00:51:57,475
Wait. Where are you going

944
00:51:57,509 --> 00:51:59,444
To get his parents.

945
00:52:11,824 --> 00:52:14,359
Maybe somewhere somebody
has survived the gas.

946
00:52:14,393 --> 00:52:15,960
Not one single being survived.

947
00:52:15,994 --> 00:52:17,595
Says who?

948
00:52:17,629 --> 00:52:18,830
The people who know.

949
00:52:18,864 --> 00:52:21,366
- You mean the government?
- Yes.

950
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,901
And scientists.

951
00:52:22,935 --> 00:52:25,804
But what if they're wrong?

952
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:27,372
Excuse me?

953
00:52:27,406 --> 00:52:29,607
Last time, Mr. Fullam,
my math teacher,

954
00:52:29,641 --> 00:52:32,610
well, he got something wrong,
he didn't realize it at first,

955
00:52:32,644 --> 00:52:35,580
and he told poor Tommy
off for challenging him,

956
00:52:35,614 --> 00:52:37,649
but he had to find Tommy after
break and apologize to him

957
00:52:37,683 --> 00:52:40,886
because Tommy was right
and Mr. Fullam was wrong.

958
00:52:43,455 --> 00:52:44,989
He's very clever, Tommy.

959
00:52:45,023 --> 00:52:47,625
Well, is Tommy
taking the pill?

960
00:52:47,659 --> 00:52:50,695
Probably. His mother hates him.

961
00:52:50,729 --> 00:52:53,832
What if the best scientist died,
and then... and then

962
00:52:53,866 --> 00:52:56,468
the lazy one took over, and then
the lazy one went home

963
00:52:56,502 --> 00:52:59,070
one night, and forgot to upload
some file, and then...

964
00:52:59,104 --> 00:53:01,973
and then died in the morning?

965
00:53:02,007 --> 00:53:04,442
What if one of the shit
scientists is in charge

966
00:53:04,476 --> 00:53:05,744
of whether I live or die?

967
00:53:05,778 --> 00:53:07,912
Hey, hey.

968
00:53:07,946 --> 00:53:10,382
This isn't pretend, Art.

969
00:53:10,416 --> 00:53:13,818
There isn't someone somewhere
who's made a mistake.

970
00:53:13,852 --> 00:53:15,587
People don't generally know
they made a mistake

971
00:53:15,621 --> 00:53:17,989
until they've made it,
and then we'll all be dead,

972
00:53:18,023 --> 00:53:21,126
and then there won't be
anyone to apologize to.

973
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,761
I'm sorry.

974
00:53:22,795 --> 00:53:24,095
I really am.

975
00:53:24,129 --> 00:53:27,065
But I can't make this
better for you.

976
00:53:27,099 --> 00:53:29,567
Well, what about
those poor people?

977
00:53:29,601 --> 00:53:31,536
Who's going to hold their hand
while they die in pain?

978
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:33,171
Life isn't fair, Art.

979
00:53:33,205 --> 00:53:36,441
That's what people say when they
don't want to find a solution.

980
00:53:37,976 --> 00:53:39,844
You can't help them.

981
00:53:39,878 --> 00:53:42,981
But you can. You're a doctor.
You're supposed to save people.

Hey, you're very kind boy, Art.

1004
00:55:15,974 --> 00:55:17,242
I'm not kind.

1005
00:55:17,277 --> 00:55:18,776
I just don't want to give up,

1006
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:21,313
and I don't think
anyone else should either.

1007
00:56:52,738 --> 00:56:54,005
I'm pregnant.

1008
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:56,975
So I'm not going
to take the pill.

1009
00:56:57,009 --> 00:57:00,279
Does being pregnant
mean you won't die?

1010
00:57:00,313 --> 00:57:03,048
I will, but not from the pill.

1011
00:57:07,019 --> 00:57:08,954
I don't want to kill my baby.

1012
00:57:09,655 --> 00:57:11,790
Art?

1013
00:57:12,824 --> 00:57:14,326
What's going on?

1014
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,395
Sophie's pregnant. She doesn't
want to kill her baby.

1015
00:57:16,429 --> 00:57:18,696
So she's not going to the pill,
so I'm going to stay alive

1016
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:21,032
and hold her hand when she dies.

1017
00:57:21,066 --> 00:57:23,001
Is that cool with you?

1018
00:57:26,071 --> 00:57:27,038
Simon!

1019
00:57:27,072 --> 00:57:29,107
Yay!

1020
00:57:34,212 --> 00:57:35,414
You're overreacting.

1021
00:57:35,448 --> 00:57:36,948
I am your mother Art,

1022
00:57:36,982 --> 00:57:38,182
- I know.
- Not her.

1023
00:57:38,216 --> 00:57:39,784
- I know.
- You don't just ask

1024
00:57:39,818 --> 00:57:41,052
- some stranger.
- She's hardly a stranger.

1025
00:57:41,086 --> 00:57:42,421
- Oh, shut up.
- You shut up.

1026
00:57:42,455 --> 00:57:43,988
- You shut up.
- No, you shut up.

1027
00:57:44,022 --> 00:57:46,190
- You shut up.
- You shut up.

1028
00:57:46,224 --> 00:57:47,925
- Shut up!
- Stop copying me, you stu...

1029
00:57:47,959 --> 00:57:51,963
Don't you talk
to your mother like that!

1030
00:57:51,997 --> 00:57:53,798
At least Sophie cares
about her child.

1031
00:57:53,832 --> 00:57:56,801
- How dare you?!
- How dare you?!

1032
00:57:56,835 --> 00:57:58,136
What's going on, Art?

1033
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:01,272
I'm taking that fucking pill.

1034
00:58:01,307 --> 00:58:03,908
Yes, you are.

1035
00:58:03,942 --> 00:58:06,744
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you fucking are.

1036
00:58:06,778 --> 00:58:09,381
- No, I'm fucking not.
- Stop swearing.

1037
00:58:09,415 --> 00:58:11,716
See, you made a rule,
and you can't even stick to it.

1038
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:13,385
We are your parents.

1039
00:58:13,419 --> 00:58:15,687
You want to murder me.

1040
00:58:15,721 --> 00:58:18,256
Just stop. Stop it. Stop it.

1041
00:58:18,291 --> 00:58:19,757
God says thou shall not kill.

1042
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:21,760
Fuck God!

1043
00:58:24,229 --> 00:58:26,432
- I knew it.
- He just tricked you.

1044
00:58:26,466 --> 00:58:28,367
Yes, I know.

1045
00:58:28,401 --> 00:58:32,904
So you don't even believe
in God. You're just afraid.

1046
00:58:32,938 --> 00:58:34,172
Yes, I-I am.

1047
00:58:34,206 --> 00:58:36,774
I am... I am afraid.

1048
00:58:36,808 --> 00:58:39,778
I am absolutely terrified.

1049
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,147
Please, Dad, stay with me.

1050
00:58:43,181 --> 00:58:44,882
We can hide from
the poison together.

1051
00:58:44,916 --> 00:58:46,818
We can... we can
shut the windows,

1052
00:58:46,852 --> 00:58:51,390
and we can barricade the doors,
and we can wait it out.

1053
00:58:51,424 --> 00:58:54,759
Please, Dad, I need a grown up.
I can't do it on my own.

1054
00:58:58,163 --> 00:59:01,899
It'll be airborne, Art.

1055
00:59:01,933 --> 00:59:04,035
It will travel
through the windows,

1056
00:59:04,069 --> 00:59:07,038
the doors, the water pipes.

1057
00:59:07,072 --> 00:59:09,741
You can't hide from it, Art.

1058
00:59:10,909 --> 00:59:13,978
It will kill anything and anyone
that is still alive.

1059
00:59:14,012 --> 00:59:15,380
Yes.

1060
00:59:15,414 --> 00:59:17,182
I don't believe you.

1061
00:59:19,785 --> 00:59:22,321
Okay, come here. Come here.

1062
00:59:24,923 --> 00:59:28,192
Your father and I have discussed
this over and over again.

1063
00:59:28,226 --> 00:59:31,896
We have discussed
every possible option.

1064
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:34,031
If... if... if we don't
take the pill,

1065
00:59:34,065 --> 00:59:36,901
if you don't take the pill,
if... if your brothers

1066
00:59:36,935 --> 00:59:39,938
don't take the pill...
look at me, look at me.

1067
00:59:43,509 --> 00:59:48,045
But the outcome
is always the same.

1068
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,148
And in no particular order.

1069
00:59:52,351 --> 00:59:56,154
We will all die one by one.

1070
00:59:56,188 --> 01:00:01,059
And you will be left crying
with no one to comfort you.

1071
01:00:03,329 --> 01:00:05,096
And I can't do that.

1072
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:09,234
I can't let babies suffer alone.

1073
01:00:15,207 --> 01:00:17,276
I don't mind anymore.

1074
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:19,210
What?

1075
01:00:20,613 --> 01:00:23,315
I said I don't mind anymore.

1076
01:00:23,349 --> 01:00:26,552
We're your family, Art.

1077
01:00:30,088 --> 01:00:32,257
Not if you kill me, we're not.

1078
01:00:35,894 --> 01:00:37,896
Art!

1079
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:42,967
- Art?
- Art!

1080
01:00:53,579 --> 01:00:56,382
Art, come back.
You're scaring me.

1081
01:01:04,657 --> 01:01:06,492
Art?!

1082
01:01:23,241 --> 01:01:25,076
Belinda?

1083
01:01:31,484 --> 01:01:34,586
Art!

1084
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:37,422
Art!

1085
01:01:37,456 --> 01:01:39,224
Where are you?!

1086
01:02:34,212 --> 01:02:37,282
Art! Art!

1087
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:42,053
Simon!

1088
01:02:45,223 --> 01:02:48,159
Art!

1089
01:02:54,099 --> 01:02:56,535
Jesus Christ.

1090
01:02:56,569 --> 01:02:59,203
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1091
01:03:00,373 --> 01:03:02,474
We have to... Come on! Go!

1092
01:03:02,508 --> 01:03:05,076
Come on! Come on!

1093
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:06,243
Watch it!

1094
01:03:08,781 --> 01:03:10,716
Run!

1095
01:03:19,492 --> 01:03:23,194
Get inside! Get inside!

1096
01:03:34,573 --> 01:03:36,007
Kids, go to your room.

1097
01:03:37,376 --> 01:03:38,410
What's happened?

1098
01:03:38,444 --> 01:03:40,044
- Now!
- Is he okay?

1099
01:03:40,078 --> 01:03:41,145
- He's upset.
- Mommy.

1100
01:03:41,179 --> 01:03:42,447
Shall I take him upstairs?

1101
01:03:42,481 --> 01:03:44,081
Just take the twins
to their room. Go.

1102
01:03:44,115 --> 01:03:45,350
- Mommy?
- Okay, come, kids.

1103
01:03:45,384 --> 01:03:47,118
Come on, boys.
Come on, quick, quick.

1104
01:03:47,152 --> 01:03:48,420
I'll be up in a minute.

1105
01:03:48,454 --> 01:03:50,522
- Don't be creepy.
- Simon, let me help.

1106
01:03:50,556 --> 01:03:52,557
- Fuck off.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1107
01:03:52,591 --> 01:03:54,626
- I'm sorry.
- Just... Just give me a second.

1108
01:03:59,097 --> 01:04:01,400
Just let me take him
upstairs to Nell.

1109
01:04:01,434 --> 01:04:03,802
Let him take him to Nell.

1110
01:04:03,836 --> 01:04:05,504
Hey.

1111
01:04:05,538 --> 01:04:07,539
Here, champ, I got you.

1112
01:04:07,573 --> 01:04:10,241
It's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.

1113
01:04:10,276 --> 01:04:12,344
I got you. Tony.

1114
01:04:13,779 --> 01:04:17,215
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

1115
01:04:22,755 --> 01:04:24,556
Fuck!

1116
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:28,727
I got you.

1117
01:04:30,228 --> 01:04:32,631
They're all fucking dead.

1118
01:04:32,665 --> 01:04:34,566
Who's dead?

1119
01:04:36,769 --> 01:04:39,136
Here you are. It's okay.
It's okay.

1120
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:41,573
I'm sorry.

1121
01:04:41,607 --> 01:04:44,509
Just go get Nell.
I'm going to check on Simon.

1122
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,411
Okay.

1123
01:04:46,445 --> 01:04:48,145
We're going to get
your mom, okay?

1124
01:04:48,179 --> 01:04:51,517
We'll go and get your mom.
It's gonna be okay.

1125
01:04:52,284 --> 01:04:53,351
Who's dead?

1126
01:04:53,385 --> 01:04:56,822
They're all fucking dead, Tony.

1127
01:04:56,856 --> 01:05:01,460
Of course they are.
Most of the world's dead.

1128
01:05:09,301 --> 01:05:12,537
Art's okay.
He's upstairs with Nell.

1129
01:05:14,306 --> 01:05:18,376
Don't swallow.
I'm sorry. I can't understand.

1130
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:21,313
What is it? What is it?

1131
01:05:21,347 --> 01:05:24,148
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1132
01:05:24,182 --> 01:05:26,318
Just breathe.

1133
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:32,524
Now, if you can,
start from the beginning.

1134
01:05:33,258 --> 01:05:34,826
I went and took the chickens...
I took the chickens out

1135
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:37,161
at about 12:30 p.m.

1136
01:05:37,195 --> 01:05:40,365
Sorry, are you joking?

1137
01:05:40,399 --> 01:05:42,434
Tell us what happened?

1138
01:05:42,468 --> 01:05:43,602
Hey, hey.

1139
01:05:43,636 --> 01:05:45,871
Art ran off.

1140
01:05:45,905 --> 01:05:48,840
And I found him...
I found him on the side

1141
01:05:48,874 --> 01:05:51,810
of the road with this car.

1142
01:05:51,844 --> 01:05:53,445
And they were all dead, James.

1143
01:05:53,479 --> 01:05:55,614
There was even a baby.

1144
01:05:59,217 --> 01:06:01,286
I'll go get your mom.

1145
01:06:07,626 --> 01:06:10,662
Nell? Nell?

1146
01:06:43,762 --> 01:06:45,797
But then the wind changed,

1147
01:06:45,831 --> 01:06:48,967
and then all I could
hear Art screaming.

1148
01:06:50,636 --> 01:06:52,604
Tony, don't!

1149
01:06:52,638 --> 01:06:54,706
- Simon.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1150
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:58,376
Simon, the bodies, the bodies,
was there any blood

1151
01:06:58,410 --> 01:07:00,679
in the ears, eyes, mouth?

1152
01:07:00,713 --> 01:07:01,947
Vomit?

1153
01:07:01,981 --> 01:07:03,615
Were they sweating?
Was there urine?

1154
01:07:03,649 --> 01:07:06,351
Stop it, James.
Just stop it!

1155
01:07:06,385 --> 01:07:08,554
Poison's not coming
till tomorrow.

1156
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:14,459
It is tomorrow.

1157
01:07:14,493 --> 01:07:16,895
I'll go and check on Art.

1158
01:07:24,737 --> 01:07:27,305
I was just checking on Art.

1159
01:07:27,339 --> 01:07:29,474
No, no.

1160
01:07:30,809 --> 01:07:35,280
I get it. You're pregnant.
And that is unimaginable.

1161
01:07:35,314 --> 01:07:37,515
But Art is my son.

1162
01:07:37,549 --> 01:07:41,587
This is my family, and we have
had enough of you interfering.

1163
01:08:05,878 --> 01:08:09,447
Oh. Oh, uh...

1164
01:08:09,481 --> 01:08:14,386
Simon, you are a good man.

1165
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:17,889
An excellent father.

1166
01:08:17,923 --> 01:08:20,359
And a darling friend.

1167
01:08:20,559 --> 01:08:21,960
Hm?

1168
01:08:24,063 --> 01:08:28,333
But it is time, hm?

1169
01:08:28,367 --> 01:08:31,569
- Mm-hmm?
- Hm.

1170
01:08:31,603 --> 01:08:33,872
Let's go.

1171
01:08:39,712 --> 01:08:41,346
It's gonna be fine.

1172
01:08:59,565 --> 01:09:01,300
Shit!

1173
01:09:15,047 --> 01:09:17,582
I love you both.

1174
01:09:18,617 --> 01:09:20,786
Go and be with your families.

1175
01:09:23,589 --> 01:09:25,424
Go on.

1176
01:09:28,127 --> 01:09:30,829
Right behind you.

1177
01:09:35,434 --> 01:09:37,069
Cheers.

1178
01:09:48,113 --> 01:09:50,048
Shh.

1179
01:09:50,082 --> 01:09:52,817
You're my beautiful boy.

1180
01:09:52,851 --> 01:09:54,619
Tell me what happened,
sweetheart.

1181
01:09:54,653 --> 01:09:57,422
- Art, what happened?
- Do you a hug?

1182
01:09:59,124 --> 01:10:01,993
Are you exhausted?

1183
01:10:02,027 --> 01:10:04,863
He's exhausted.
It's all right.

1184
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:15,474
Have I always been boring?

1185
01:10:21,447 --> 01:10:24,450
But you're so much more
than that.

1186
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,488
What happened out there?

1187
01:10:30,522 --> 01:10:31,956
Are you okay, Daddy?

1188
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:34,025
Is Art having a breakdown?

1189
01:10:34,059 --> 01:10:36,828
No, he's just, um...

1190
01:10:37,729 --> 01:10:40,198
He's just very upset.

1191
01:10:40,232 --> 01:10:41,966
Has he calmed down yet?

1192
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,136
Yeah.

1193
01:10:48,941 --> 01:10:52,010
It's time, boys.

1194
01:10:54,112 --> 01:10:56,147
Already?

1195
01:10:56,181 --> 01:10:58,650
Yes, I'm sorry.

1196
01:11:22,808 --> 01:11:24,810
I didn't mean to hurt Nell.

1197
01:11:32,518 --> 01:11:33,918
Fuck.

1198
01:11:33,952 --> 01:11:35,787
Was I wrong?

1199
01:11:37,923 --> 01:11:40,058
Is Art gonna be okay?

1200
01:11:43,161 --> 01:11:44,696
You promised us a can each.

1201
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:46,798
I'm not sharing, Dad.

1202
01:11:49,302 --> 01:11:51,736
The right, darling.

1203
01:12:00,913 --> 01:12:02,714
Al?

1204
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:07,619
Please... wake up.

1205
01:12:08,754 --> 01:12:12,090
Please wake up.
Please wake up.

1206
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:19,931
Please wake up!

1207
01:12:30,008 --> 01:12:32,010
Sorry.

1208
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:56,734
Here you go, darling.

1209
01:12:56,768 --> 01:12:58,202
It's warm, Dad.

1210
01:12:58,236 --> 01:12:59,904
Mine too.

1211
01:12:59,938 --> 01:13:02,674
Art, is yours warm?

1212
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:03,841
Yep.

1213
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:05,743
- Dad?
- Dad?

1214
01:13:05,777 --> 01:13:09,180
Jesus Christ.

1215
01:13:18,824 --> 01:13:21,560
I'll miss you.

1216
01:14:04,903 --> 01:14:06,004
What are you doing?

1217
01:14:06,038 --> 01:14:08,106
Sophie...

1218
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:12,911
do you want both of us
and our baby to die in agony?

1219
01:14:14,012 --> 01:14:16,982
Because I won't take my pill
if you don't take yours.

1220
01:14:32,698 --> 01:14:34,966
- Thank you.
- There you go, darling.

1221
01:14:37,836 --> 01:14:40,138
Be careful.

1222
01:14:40,172 --> 01:14:42,341
Sorry, mom.

1223
01:14:42,375 --> 01:14:45,109
It's all right, sweetheart.

1224
01:14:45,143 --> 01:14:46,811
Fucking hell, Hardy!

1225
01:14:46,845 --> 01:14:48,280
- It's not my fault.
- Dad must have dropped it.

1226
01:14:48,314 --> 01:14:49,914
Did you drop the Coke?

1227
01:14:49,948 --> 01:14:52,183
I can't remember.

1228
01:14:52,217 --> 01:14:54,286
Fuck's sake.

1229
01:14:57,323 --> 01:14:58,823
Shit.

1230
01:14:58,857 --> 01:15:00,024
Fucking hell.

1231
01:15:00,058 --> 01:15:01,059
Darling.

1232
01:15:01,093 --> 01:15:02,294
- Dad.
- Dad.

1233
01:15:18,009 --> 01:15:20,446
I haven't
said goodbye to Nell!

1234
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,713
I haven't said goodbye to Art.

1235
01:15:21,747 --> 01:15:23,047
I haven't said goodbye to Simon.

1236
01:15:23,081 --> 01:15:26,150
Hold me. Please, please,
Kitty, just once.

1237
01:15:26,184 --> 01:15:27,251
I'll hold you.

1238
01:15:27,286 --> 01:15:29,821
No. No, I want Kitty.

1239
01:15:29,855 --> 01:15:30,922
Please, darling.

1240
01:15:30,956 --> 01:15:33,024
My doll! Baby Kitty!

1241
01:15:33,058 --> 01:15:36,894
Oh, no, Kitty, wait. I'll come.
My legs... I can't feel my legs.

1242
01:15:36,928 --> 01:15:39,331
Stop.

1243
01:15:39,365 --> 01:15:41,199
K-K...

1244
01:15:43,101 --> 01:15:44,269
Kitty!

1245
01:16:32,585 --> 01:16:34,218
No!

1246
01:16:54,105 --> 01:16:57,008
Say when.

1247
01:16:57,042 --> 01:16:59,311
Stop.

1248
01:17:00,413 --> 01:17:02,847
Compare.

1249
01:17:02,881 --> 01:17:04,883
Okay.

1250
01:17:08,521 --> 01:17:10,254
Happy?

1251
01:17:10,289 --> 01:17:12,023
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1252
01:17:22,167 --> 01:17:23,968
All right.

1253
01:17:25,571 --> 01:17:27,205
Palm out.

1254
01:17:27,873 --> 01:17:29,207
Palm.

1255
01:17:29,241 --> 01:17:31,843
- They're huge.
- Massive.

1256
01:17:31,877 --> 01:17:34,513
How are we going
to swallow them?

1257
01:17:34,547 --> 01:17:37,616
Mum.

1258
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:39,851
Art.

1259
01:17:39,885 --> 01:17:44,389
- Art, darling.
- Art, wake up.

1260
01:17:44,423 --> 01:17:48,293
- Art, wake up.
- Art?

1261
01:17:48,327 --> 01:17:51,463
- Geez!
- Oh, my God!

1262
01:17:53,532 --> 01:17:57,101
Oh, my God!

1263
01:17:57,135 --> 01:17:59,204
Shit, shit.

1264
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:04,610
Coke.

1265
01:18:04,644 --> 01:18:06,378
- Dad?
- Mum?

1266
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,349
Ah.

1267
01:18:10,383 --> 01:18:12,984
Okay, did you swallow it?
You swallowed it?

1268
01:18:13,018 --> 01:18:14,218
Have you swallowed it?
Yes?

1269
01:18:14,252 --> 01:18:15,987
Okay.

1270
01:18:20,025 --> 01:18:23,127
My baby.

1271
01:18:23,696 --> 01:18:26,532
Oh, fuck.

1272
01:18:28,701 --> 01:18:30,268
Son.

1273
01:18:30,303 --> 01:18:32,170
Okay.

1274
01:18:39,312 --> 01:18:41,380
Alright, everyone.

1275
01:18:41,414 --> 01:18:43,981
Everyone get into bed,
close your eyes.

1276
01:18:44,015 --> 01:18:45,684
Okay, okay, come on.

1277
01:18:45,718 --> 01:18:47,118
On the bed.

1278
01:18:56,161 --> 01:18:57,995
Jesus.

1279
01:18:58,029 --> 01:18:59,398
How much did I drink?

1280
01:18:59,432 --> 01:19:02,199
Fucking hell!
For fuck sake!

1281
01:19:02,233 --> 01:19:03,935
Where is everyone?

1282
01:19:03,969 --> 01:19:06,605
We've got five minutes.

1283
01:19:06,639 --> 01:19:08,407
Okay.

1284
01:19:11,076 --> 01:19:13,211
Five fucking minutes!

1285
01:20:09,702 --> 01:20:11,235
Dad?

1286
01:21:02,721 --> 01:21:04,523
What the fuck, Bella?

1287
01:21:04,557 --> 01:21:07,058
You puked up the pill.

1288
01:21:07,092 --> 01:21:11,162
Fuckin' piss head.

1289
01:21:34,687 --> 01:21:36,655
I want you to think of heaven.

1290
01:21:36,689 --> 01:21:42,159
I want you to imagine a cloud
that's... a giant cloud

1291
01:21:42,193 --> 01:21:44,161
that's made of candy...
Oh, my God!

1292
01:21:44,195 --> 01:21:45,597
I haven't said goodbye
to Sandra.

1293
01:21:45,631 --> 01:21:46,865
- No.
- No, I have to.

1294
01:21:46,899 --> 01:21:48,500
There's no time, Nell. Just...

1295
01:21:48,534 --> 01:21:53,071
Just stay with us.
Lie down. Close your eyes.

1296
01:21:57,610 --> 01:21:59,344
I love you, Daddy.

1297
01:21:59,378 --> 01:22:01,379
You're the best daddy...

1298
01:22:01,413 --> 01:22:07,352
in the whole wide world.

1299
01:22:08,787 --> 01:22:10,822
