00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,550
All right.
My shift's not over till 9:00.

3
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:20,883
So tell Coach C I'm gonna be

4
00:00:20,967 --> 00:00:22,508
a few minutes late
picking you up, okay?

5
00:00:22,592 --> 00:00:23,925
Okay.

6
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:25,383
Good luck out there today.

7
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:26,967
Thanks.

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,258
Hey.

9
00:00:29,217 --> 00:00:30,633
You know, if I could,

10
00:00:30,717 --> 00:00:33,133
I would be in those stands
cheering for my baby.

11
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,300
I know. Next game.

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,633
Hey, Bron?

13
00:00:39,758 --> 00:00:41,467
You forgetting something?

14
00:00:46,092 --> 00:00:48,550
Love you, Ma.

15
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:50,883
I love you too, baby.

16
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,467
All right. Go kill it.

What's up, Bron?

19
00:01:05,383 --> 00:01:06,842
What's up, Malik?

20
00:01:09,883 --> 00:01:13,258
Check it out. It's for you.

21
00:01:13,342 --> 00:01:15,592
My dad got me
the new color one.

22
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:16,758
Oh, and if
it freezes up on you,

23
00:01:16,842 --> 00:01:18,425
just smack it really hard.

24
00:01:18,508 --> 00:01:20,050
- Works every time.
- Thanks, man.

25
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:22,175
Let's go get this win.

26
00:01:22,842 --> 00:01:24,467
Phew!

27
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,383
<i>Eh, what's up, Doc?</i>

28
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:35,342
Hey, where Bron at?

29
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,300
LeBron James!

30
00:01:37,383 --> 00:01:38,592
<i>Eh, what's up...</i>

31
00:01:38,675 --> 00:01:40,300
- What the hell is this?
- Oh, snap!

32
00:01:40,383 --> 00:01:41,758
"Oh, snap" nothing, man.

33
00:01:41,842 --> 00:01:44,008
Get your tail on the court
right now! Whatchu doing?

34
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:46,258
Hey, hey, hey!

35
00:01:46,342 --> 00:01:49,133
Iso! Iso for Bron!

36
00:01:49,217 --> 00:01:51,800
Nobody else shoot the ball.

37
00:01:51,883 --> 00:01:54,133
All right, Bron,
you keep that ball!

38
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:56,383
You shoot the ball.

39
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:57,800
- Iso! Iso! Iso!
- You know what to do,

40
00:01:57,883 --> 00:01:59,467
baby. Let's go.
It's your world.

41
00:02:06,425 --> 00:02:08,092
Damn! Damn!

42
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:10,092
It's all right,
it's all right.

43
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:11,342
Damn!

44
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:13,258
Come on, line up.
Line up in front of me.

45
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,342
Line up right here
in front of me.

46
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:20,925
<i>Listen, man.</i>

47
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,092
I'm not even disappointed

48
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,175
about us
losing the game tonight

49
00:02:23,258 --> 00:02:24,925
'cause it's not about that.

50
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:26,092
It's about you giving your all,

51
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:27,842
and you didn't do that tonight.

52
00:02:27,925 --> 00:02:29,050
LeBron.

53
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,508
You wasn't focused.

54
00:02:32,592 --> 00:02:34,008
Getting your head in the game

55
00:02:34,092 --> 00:02:35,508
starts before you even put
one foot on the court.

56
00:02:35,592 --> 00:02:37,217
It starts before you even
get to the gym.

57
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,842
- But everybody on the team plays video game...
- LeBron.

58
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,717
This ain't about everybody,
this is about you.

59
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,508
Listen, you're
the best basketball player

60
00:02:43,592 --> 00:02:44,883
I ever coached.

61
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:47,008
You could be
a once-in-a-generation talent

62
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:51,133
if you focus on the game
of basketball and not these

63
00:02:51,217 --> 00:02:52,675
distractions.

64
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:55,842
You can't be great without
putting in work, right?

65
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,467
You got the chance
to use basketball

66
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,675
to change everything.

67
00:02:58,758 --> 00:02:59,925
For your mom, for you,

68
00:03:00,008 --> 00:03:02,300
for everybody
who you care about.

69
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:04,717
You want that?

70
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,508
<i>LeBron James</i>

<i>I love you. I'm back!</i>

94
00:04:54,258 --> 00:04:57,383

<i>You bet!</i>

104
00:05:34,008 --> 00:05:36,300
So how much more work
does your video game need?

105
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,425
It's been months.

106
00:05:37,508 --> 00:05:38,717
It's almost ready.

107
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,092
Like how you're
almost ready to tell Dad

108
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:42,383
about the E3 Game Camp
next weekend?

109
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,717
I'm waiting on the right time.

110
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,883
Honestly, I just think
you should rip

111
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:46,300
the Band-Aid off and ask him.

112
00:05:46,383 --> 00:05:47,633
You're just saying that
'cause he says yes

113
00:05:47,717 --> 00:05:48,925
to everything you ask.

114
00:05:49,008 --> 00:05:50,217
That's 'cause I'm nice.

115
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,217
- You're not that nice.
- That's big talk.

116
00:05:53,217 --> 00:05:55,217
See if you can back it up.

117
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,050
Come on,
let's see what you can do.

118
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,717
All right.
Don't get crossed.

119
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,508
Oh! Gotcha!

120
00:06:03,175 --> 00:06:05,050
Yeah, okay.

121
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:07,050
Come on, bro.

122
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,508
Dom.

123
00:06:08,592 --> 00:06:09,800
What was that?

124
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:11,717
An open shot.

125
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,133
And if you're gonna be
out here,

126
00:06:13,217 --> 00:06:14,383
it's about giving everything
that you got.

127
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:15,883
And not whatever that was.

128
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:17,508
Where's your fundamentals?

129
00:06:17,592 --> 00:06:18,717
We having fun.

130
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,550
Everything in between
these four lines

131
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:21,717
is work.

132
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,842
Who said I wasn't working?

133
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,883
This thing right here.

134
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:28,883
Told you not to bring
that out here.

135
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:31,175
Come on, Dom.
This isn't a game.

136
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:32,508
I need you focusing more...

137
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:33,758
...instead of playing
with these toys.

138
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:34,842
Darius, chill out.

139
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:36,592
You know
I got full court vision.

140
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:38,633
How does he do that?

141
00:06:38,717 --> 00:06:40,467
Ball.

142
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,925
Show me that step-back move
I taught you.

143
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:45,008
You got this, son.

144
00:06:45,092 --> 00:06:46,425
- In and out. Crossover.
- In and out.

145
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:47,383
Step back.

146
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:52,133
Come on, Dom.
You gotta concentrate.

147
00:06:52,217 --> 00:06:54,092
Darius, show him the move.

148
00:06:54,175 --> 00:06:55,717
Watch me.

149
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,883
Ball.

150
00:06:57,967 --> 00:07:00,633
In and out. Crossover.
Step back. Shoot.

151
00:07:01,883 --> 00:07:03,300
Yep. See,
that's 'cause your brother

152
00:07:03,383 --> 00:07:04,550
been putting in that work.

153
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,175
I ball all day.

154
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:07,883
Ow!

155
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:09,758
Dom. Focus.

156
00:07:09,842 --> 00:07:11,425
You got basketball camp
next weekend.

157
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:13,175
Them boys gonna be coming
at your neck.

158
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:14,675
Seeing what you got.

159
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,842
Oh, we quitting
on each other now?

160
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:25,467
Can't be great
without putting in work.

161
00:07:38,217 --> 00:07:40,133
All right. That's my guy.

162
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:42,008
Let's get some work done.

163
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:43,883
Enough of these games.

164
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:46,008
Okay. I'm ready.

165
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,050
Boys!

166
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:50,758
Y'all can't stay out here
all day.

167
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:51,967
It's dinnertime.

168
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,217
Oh, man.

169
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,008
Really, Bron?

170
00:07:55,092 --> 00:07:56,217
What are we having for dinner?

171
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,425
Spaghetti and meatball?

172
00:07:58,508 --> 00:07:59,800
Ow!

173
00:07:59,883 --> 00:08:01,883
- Ooh, that's my favorite.
- Damn!

174
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,092
We talked about you
affirming Dom more.

175
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:17,842
Spending some
unstructured time with him.

176
00:08:17,925 --> 00:08:19,467
We was just outside.

177
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,758
I mean,
how much more spontaneous

178
00:08:20,842 --> 00:08:21,883
do you want me to be?

179
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,467
Babe, I am worried

180
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,133
that you are pushing him
too hard.

181
00:08:25,217 --> 00:08:26,508
I mean,
the kid keep telling me

182
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:27,883
he want the best coaching

183
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:29,258
so he can be the best player
on the court.

184
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,883
Have you thought
about talking to your son

185
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:32,883
about something
other than basketball?

186
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:34,217
Like what?

187
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,133
Like how Dom
built a video game.

188
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:40,592
He's 12
and he built his own game.

189
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:42,717
Yeah, I know.
I mean, that's great.

190
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,092
I mean,
but if I don't push him,

191
00:08:45,175 --> 00:08:46,550
if I don't stay on him,

192
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:48,550
- all the distractions...
- He doesn't need a coach.

193
00:08:51,092 --> 00:08:53,008
He needs his dad.

194
00:09:30,175 --> 00:09:31,633
<i>LeBron James, a hit.</i>

195
00:09:31,717 --> 00:09:32,967
- <i>James...</i>
<i>- LeBron James...</i>

196
00:09:47,383 --> 00:09:49,258
I've searched far and wide

197
00:09:49,342 --> 00:09:52,217
for the perfect partner
for this launch,

198
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,383
and I've finally found him.

199
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:55,633
LeBron James.

200
00:09:58,383 --> 00:10:00,467
Pete, he's a family man,

201
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,800
an entrepreneur,

202
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:03,842
a social media superstar

203
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:06,467
with millions of fans
worldwide.

204
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,842
Algorithmically speaking,
he's more than an athlete.

205
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,758
He's a king.

206
00:10:12,842 --> 00:10:15,300
Hmm?

207
00:10:15,383 --> 00:10:17,175
I know I'm just
an algorithm, Pete.

208
00:10:17,258 --> 00:10:19,592
That's precisely
why I need King James.

209
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:25,925
I'm stuck
inside the Serververse.

210
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:31,258
No one knows who I am
or what I do.

211
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,425
But that all changes today.

212
00:10:36,508 --> 00:10:39,675
Because today,
Warner Bros. launches

213
00:10:39,758 --> 00:10:43,133
the revolutionary technology
that I masterminded.

214
00:10:44,925 --> 00:10:46,675
Today,

215
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:48,967
it's my time to shine.

216
00:10:51,008 --> 00:10:54,508
Just look at this guy, Pete.

217
00:10:54,592 --> 00:10:58,300
Oh, he is the key element
to this entire operation.

218
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,883
Once I partner with King James

219
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:07,967
and combine his fame
with my incredible tech...

220
00:11:09,383 --> 00:11:12,342
I will finally get
the recognition and respect

221
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:14,592
that I so richly deserve.

222
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,425
LeBron James, get ready.

223
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:30,300
Oh, hello.

224
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:34,508
A new idea from the algorithm.

225
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:36,675
I'm listening.

226
00:12:10,842 --> 00:12:11,883
Hey, son.

227
00:12:13,592 --> 00:12:15,217
What you doing?

228
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,008
Um, just building my game.

229
00:12:18,092 --> 00:12:19,675
Is this the one
you've been working on?

230
00:12:19,758 --> 00:12:23,258
Actually, it's basically done,
but I...

231
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:24,800
Here. Just...

232
00:12:24,883 --> 00:12:27,342
I still have to figure out
some of the player designs.

233
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:31,092
Whoa.
Who are those guys?

234
00:12:31,175 --> 00:12:33,008
Oh, those are
people around the world

235
00:12:33,092 --> 00:12:35,883
tuning in to my livestream.
It's pretty cool, huh?

236
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,175
Okay.

237
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:39,633
And this is how it works.
You do combos and moves,

238
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,092
and the better you do,
the more people tune in.

239
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:44,217
Let me see
a couple of those combo moves.

240
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,258
Crossover. Foul line!

241
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:47,383
Oh, that was nice.

242
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:50,300
- Ooh! Posterized!
- Posterized?

243
00:12:50,383 --> 00:12:52,717
Is this not real basketball?

244
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,508
Well, I put a spin to it.

245
00:12:54,592 --> 00:12:56,717
You can get style points.

246
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,342
- Power-ups.
<i>- Count it!</i>

247
00:12:58,425 --> 00:13:01,008
It's like basketball,
but better.

248
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:04,800
You just play for fun.
Remember fun, Dad?

249
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:05,967
Tsk. I am fun.

250
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,508
Man, give me that.

251
00:13:07,592 --> 00:13:08,633
Show you how fun I am.

252
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:10,508
Kick your butt in this game.

253
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:12,967
Dang, I miss this, man.
I ain't...

254
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,217
- Whoa.
<i>- Gimme dat!</i>

255
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,342
Were you trying
to do my move?

256
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:16,675
Yeah, I put it in the game.

257
00:13:16,758 --> 00:13:19,383
In and out.
Crossover. Step back.

258
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:20,508
Let it go.

259
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:23,133
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

260
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:24,883
No.

261
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:26,217
Why... Why he freeze?

262
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,008
No, no, no.

263
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:31,967
Man, can you fix it?
'Cause I don't want...

264
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,508
Hey, don't try
to blame me for that.

265
00:13:33,592 --> 00:13:35,842
No. No, no.
Don't erase my char...

266
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,383
My entire character is gone.

267
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:46,508
It's gonna take me at least
a week to rebuild this.

268
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:51,675
Listen, son.

269
00:13:51,758 --> 00:13:52,925
Setbacks happen.

270
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:55,300
Adversity is a part of
the process, man.

271
00:13:55,383 --> 00:13:56,758
But if you're passionate
about something,

272
00:13:56,842 --> 00:13:58,592
you gotta learn
how to push through it.

273
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:02,842
You got me?

274
00:14:04,258 --> 00:14:05,300
Hey, I think
I've got something

275
00:14:05,383 --> 00:14:06,383
that will cheer you up.

276
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:07,592
I'm meeting at Warner Bros.

277
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:09,508
about some
high-tech movie thing.

278
00:14:09,592 --> 00:14:11,258
You should come. Cool?

279
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:12,383
Yeah, Dad.

280
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:13,717
Oh, snap.

281
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,008
Did Dad just come up
with a dope idea?

282
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:18,717
Please don't dab.

283
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,925
Oh, what'd you just say?

284
00:14:20,008 --> 00:14:22,217
Did you just say,
"Please, Dad, dab"?

285
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,008
- No, I said...
- Dab.

286
00:14:24,092 --> 00:14:26,967
Uncle Malik will be here
in 15. Let's roll.

287
00:14:30,008 --> 00:14:31,300
It's called Warner 3000

288
00:14:31,383 --> 00:14:33,217
and it's supposed to be
next level!

289
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,717
This could be the new wave!

290
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,425
<i>Hello. I'm Al G. Rhythm.</i>

291
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:38,967
<i>And as you might have guessed,</i>

292
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,800
<i>I am an algorithm
here at Warner Bros.</i>

293
00:14:41,883 --> 00:14:44,258
<i>The studio
behind all the classics.</i>

294
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:48,592
<i>But now, it's time for
our greatest creation yet,</i>

295
00:14:48,675 --> 00:14:50,175
<i>Warner 3000.</i>

296
00:14:50,258 --> 00:14:51,675
<i>This will revolutionize</i>

297
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,758
<i>the entire
entertainment industry,</i>

298
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:58,175
<i>and we want you
to be on our team, King James.</i>

299
00:14:58,258 --> 00:14:59,717
<i>Now, we know you're busy,</i>

300
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,842
<i>but we can make it
very easy for you.</i>

301
00:15:02,925 --> 00:15:05,883
<i>Because our brand new
Warner 3000 technology</i>

302
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:08,217
<i>will scan you
right into the movies.</i>

303
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:12,925
<i>Oh, it's like looking
into a mirror, huh, LeBron?</i>

304
00:15:13,008 --> 00:15:16,883
<i>Think about it,</i>
<i>Batman versus LeBron.</i>

305
00:15:22,717 --> 00:15:24,550
LeBron of Thrones.

306
00:15:30,717 --> 00:15:32,967
LeBron
and the Chamber of Secrets.

307
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:36,175
<i>The possibilities are endless.</i>

308
00:15:37,592 --> 00:15:39,467
<i>You'll be
the king of Warner Bros.</i>

309
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,425
<i>That's the power
of Warner 3000.</i>

310
00:15:43,383 --> 00:15:45,883
<i>Say yes, LeBron, and together,</i>

311
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:49,508
<i>we'll make mind-blowing
entertainment</i>

312
00:15:49,592 --> 00:15:50,592
<i>forever.</i>

313
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,592
Huh? Huh?

314
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,508
So, what do you say?

315
00:16:04,592 --> 00:16:07,300
Pretty sweet, right?

316
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,508
I mean, look at him.

317
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,425
Look at that face.
He's speechless.

318
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:11,883
He loves it!

319
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:14,175
How about that algorithm, huh?

320
00:16:14,258 --> 00:16:15,800
<i>Pretty brilliant.</i>

321
00:16:15,883 --> 00:16:18,092
<i>He came up
with the entire presentation.</i>

322
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,217
<i>I should watch my back.</i>

323
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,425
Yes! Thank you! Finally, huh?

324
00:16:22,508 --> 00:16:24,300
Put some 'spec
on my name, right?

325
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,050
Oh, man.

326
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:27,425
<i>That was, um...</i>

327
00:16:28,258 --> 00:16:29,383
That was something.

328
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:30,633
Right, Malik?

329
00:16:32,342 --> 00:16:34,592
Listen, guys,
I'm a ballplayer.

330
00:16:34,675 --> 00:16:36,675
You know,
and athletes acting,

331
00:16:36,758 --> 00:16:38,342
that never goes well.

332
00:16:38,425 --> 00:16:41,383
<i>I'm sorry, guys.
This is all just...</i>

333
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:42,967
<i>It's just not me.</i>

334
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,217
And I can't afford to take
time away from the game.

335
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,633
Whoa, Bron.

336
00:16:46,717 --> 00:16:48,550
<i>- Let's not be too hasty here.
- Malik.</i>

337
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,258
<i>Let's just hear</i>
<i>what they're talking about.</i>

338
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,758
<i>Nah, nah, nah.</i>

339
00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:53,550
<i>With all due respect,
with all due respect,</i>

340
00:16:53,633 --> 00:16:56,217
<i>this idea
is just straight-up bad.</i>

341
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,717
<i>That algorithm is busted.</i>

342
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,383
Busted?

343
00:17:00,467 --> 00:17:02,800
<i>It's among the worst</i>
<i>ideas I've ever heard.</i>

344
00:17:02,883 --> 00:17:04,758
Top five, easily.

345
00:17:04,842 --> 00:17:07,092
Okay. Thank you. Thank you!

346
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:08,592
That's exactly
what I was think...

347
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:10,258
You're saying
what I'm thinking.

348
00:17:10,342 --> 00:17:12,508
This is trash, this algorithm.

349
00:17:12,592 --> 00:17:14,217
You're cancelled, algorithm!

350
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,342
<i>What a terrible idea.</i>
<i>So stupid.</i>

351
00:17:16,425 --> 00:17:17,883
<i>So stupid.</i>
<i>This is what happens when...</i>

352
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:20,133
Pete, tell me he did not
just say "stupid"!

353
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:21,717
Uh-oh.

354
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,342
<i>I don't know. I think
the algorithm's pretty cool.</i>

355
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:25,467
<i>I've got a question.</i>

356
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,342
<i>Is it a heuristic algorithm</i>

357
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:29,508
<i>or some kind of
matrix variant?</i>

358
00:17:29,592 --> 00:17:34,092
Dom,
using the medulla oblongata.

359
00:17:34,175 --> 00:17:37,258
I think we got a little
Stevie Jobs on our hands.

360
00:17:37,342 --> 00:17:39,300
Yeah, I'm actually building
my own video game.

361
00:17:39,383 --> 00:17:41,092
Oh, nice, your own video game.

362
00:17:41,175 --> 00:17:43,258
You heard of the E3
Game Design Camp, right?

363
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:44,800
Yeah.

364
00:17:44,883 --> 00:17:46,508
Well, there's gonna be one
next weekend, and I'm going.

365
00:17:46,592 --> 00:17:47,967
There's gonna be a whole bunch
of other coders there.

366
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,092
Hold... Dom.

367
00:17:49,175 --> 00:17:50,092
I'm actually
looking forward...

368
00:17:50,175 --> 00:17:51,383
No. You can't go to that.

369
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:53,008
Basketball camp
is next weekend.

370
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:57,258
I'm not going
to basketball camp, Dad.

371
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:58,842
Dom, you don't
have to be scared.

372
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:01,008
You got amazing potential
on the court,

373
00:18:01,092 --> 00:18:02,550
and I can help you get there.

374
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,008
That's not what I want, Dad.

375
00:18:08,883 --> 00:18:09,925
Dom.

376
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:12,967
Wonderful to meet...

377
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,675
Excuse me, guys.

378
00:18:14,758 --> 00:18:16,508
Dom!

379
00:18:16,592 --> 00:18:18,800
Hey, hey, I'mma catch you
at the car.

380
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,258
What?

381
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,508
So, is this a hard pass or...?

382
00:18:31,592 --> 00:18:33,842
Who does
this guy think he is? Huh?

383
00:18:33,925 --> 00:18:36,633
Rejecting me? Humiliating me?

384
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:45,133
Okay.

385
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:47,925
All right.

386
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:52,508
I tried being a team player,

387
00:18:52,592 --> 00:18:54,842
but those days are over.

388
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,675
I'm done playing
by everybody else's rules.

389
00:18:57,758 --> 00:18:59,550
It is my game now.

390
00:19:02,925 --> 00:19:04,092
Dom!

391
00:19:04,175 --> 00:19:06,717
I'm your father.
When I say stop, you stop.

392
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,675
Right this way,
King James.

393
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:11,133
<i>Dom,</i>
<i>do not get in that elevator!</i>

394
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:12,508
Come on, Dom.

395
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:26,425
You know I can't let you
back out of camp like that.

396
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:28,592
You made a commitment.

397
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:31,800
You make me hate basketball.

398
00:19:31,883 --> 00:19:34,717
- You don't mean that.
- I do.

399
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,467
Everything is always
what you want.

400
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,883
You never let me do
what I wanna do.

401
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:41,800
You never let me just do me.

402
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:44,508
"Do me"?

403
00:19:44,592 --> 00:19:45,800
You think I got to "do me"

404
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:48,342
when I was 12?

405
00:19:50,092 --> 00:19:52,258
Hold up. Wrong floor.

406
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:01,717
Warner 3000.

407
00:20:04,967 --> 00:20:07,383
<i>Welcome, Dominic James.</i>

408
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,925
Wow, this is cool.

409
00:20:23,592 --> 00:20:26,050
Dom?
Stop playing, man.

410
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:27,550
You know
your mom don't like it

411
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:30,175
when I don't have you home
for dinner on time.

412
00:20:30,258 --> 00:20:33,092
All this computer stuff
is your thing, not mine.

413
00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:36,217
Dom?

414
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:43,592
Dom!

415
00:20:49,258 --> 00:20:50,092
Dom?

416
00:20:55,008 --> 00:20:57,592
What in <i>The Matrix</i> hell?

417
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,300
Dom! What's going on?

418
00:21:19,383 --> 00:21:20,592
Are you okay?

419
00:21:20,675 --> 00:21:21,883
Yeah, I'm fine.

420
00:21:22,508 --> 00:21:23,717
Wow.

421
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,300
This must be
some kind of immersive tech

422
00:21:27,383 --> 00:21:28,758
like holography

423
00:21:28,842 --> 00:21:30,883
with haptic technology,
or something like VR...

424
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:33,508
Dude, dude, dude.
Just tell me what's going on.

425
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,675
Dad, I think we're digitized.

426
00:21:35,758 --> 00:21:38,092
- We're in the computer!
- We're in the computer?

427
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:39,550
- Dad.
- You know I'm claustrophobic.

428
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:40,925
- Dad, chill out.
- How do we get out of here?

429
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,383
- Dad. Dad.
- Where's the elevators?

430
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,508
Hey, Siri, can you let us
out of here, please?

431
00:21:43,592 --> 00:21:44,842
Siri?

432
00:21:44,925 --> 00:21:46,592
<i>Who goes there?</i>

433
00:21:46,675 --> 00:21:49,883
<i>Who dares disturb the great
and powerful Al G.?</i>

434
00:21:54,258 --> 00:21:55,633
<i>Look at your faces.</i>

435
00:21:55,717 --> 00:21:57,508
<i>You were terrified!</i>

436
00:21:57,592 --> 00:21:59,883
<i>Priceless.</i>

437
00:22:08,592 --> 00:22:10,842
See? Nothing to be afraid of.

438
00:22:10,925 --> 00:22:12,008
The computer's Black.

439
00:22:12,092 --> 00:22:13,175
I can see that.

440
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:14,300
Hello.

441
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,550
Hi.

442
00:22:18,758 --> 00:22:22,008
Wow. King James.
I am a big fan.

443
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,383
I just...

444
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,217
I don't know, I thought
you'd be taller somehow.

445
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:27,258
Hmm.

446
00:22:27,342 --> 00:22:29,550
- These graphics are unreal.
- Right?

447
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:32,258
Dom, don't touch
the silver computer man.

448
00:22:32,342 --> 00:22:33,633
What's going on?

449
00:22:33,717 --> 00:22:35,425
- And who are you, man?
- Uh...

450
00:22:35,508 --> 00:22:37,425
You're right. Forgive me.
Where are my manners?

451
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:40,800
I am King Al G. Rhythm.

452
00:22:40,883 --> 00:22:42,342
Oh, you're that guy
from the video.

453
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:44,300
Yes, I am.

454
00:22:44,383 --> 00:22:46,342
And this... Ha-ha.

455
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:48,383
Oh, gentlemen, this...

456
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:52,633
this is
the Warner Bros. Serververse.

457
00:22:52,717 --> 00:22:55,050
Just make you feel
all insignificant, don't it?

458
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:57,758
Are all computers like this?

459
00:22:58,925 --> 00:23:00,258
Dom?

460
00:23:00,342 --> 00:23:01,925
- Dom?
- Uh-oh.

461
00:23:02,008 --> 00:23:04,092
What'd you do to my son?
Where's Dom?

462
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:05,342
Who's Dom?

463
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:08,217
Dude, chill out.

464
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,675
You're gonna get
your son back.

465
00:23:09,758 --> 00:23:11,342
There better not be a "but"
at the end of...

466
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:13,342
But there's something
you're gonna do for me first.

467
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,467
Like what?

468
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,258
You know, you, uh...

469
00:23:18,342 --> 00:23:20,717
You really shouldn't have
rejected my ideas back there.

470
00:23:21,758 --> 00:23:23,425
That was a mistake.

471
00:23:23,508 --> 00:23:24,717
Now, I'm afraid you're gonna

472
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
have to help me
fulfill my destiny.

473
00:23:25,883 --> 00:23:27,133
Listen, man,

474
00:23:27,217 --> 00:23:28,675
if you don't produce my son
in five seconds...

475
00:23:28,758 --> 00:23:30,633
Eh-eh! Uh-uh. No, no, no.

476
00:23:30,717 --> 00:23:32,383
All that pointing
and aggression.

477
00:23:32,467 --> 00:23:34,758
No, no, no. You're not
running things in here.

478
00:23:34,842 --> 00:23:36,800
I am the king of this domain.

479
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,758
I'm not your coach.

480
00:23:38,842 --> 00:23:40,842
Now, the only way you're
getting your son back

481
00:23:40,925 --> 00:23:43,425
is if you and I play a little
game called basketball.

482
00:23:43,508 --> 00:23:46,300
You wanna play me
in basketball?

483
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,217
Well, you didn't wanna be
in the movies.

484
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,550
You wanted to
"focus on your game."

485
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:51,633
Well, guess what?

486
00:23:51,717 --> 00:23:54,133
Now you can focus
on this game.

487
00:23:54,217 --> 00:23:57,300
You and me, we're gonna
put on a show, baby.

488
00:23:57,383 --> 00:23:59,217
We are gonna play a game
of basketball

489
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,050
in front of the largest
captive audience ever.

490
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:04,800
All your followers,

491
00:24:04,883 --> 00:24:06,717
they're all gonna be watching.

492
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,883
And when they see
the two of us together,

493
00:24:09,967 --> 00:24:13,050
I will finally step out
of the shadows

494
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:14,675
and into the light.

495
00:24:14,758 --> 00:24:16,467
And the entire world
is gonna know

496
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:21,175
the name of King Al G. Rhythm.

497
00:24:21,258 --> 00:24:23,758
But you know what,
I'm a good sport.

498
00:24:23,842 --> 00:24:25,842
Tell you what, if you win,

499
00:24:25,925 --> 00:24:28,508
you and your son can
skedaddle on out of here.

500
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,175
And what if I lose?

501
00:24:30,258 --> 00:24:31,633
Yeah. Wrinkle.

502
00:24:31,717 --> 00:24:35,175
If you lose...
Well, when you lose,

503
00:24:35,258 --> 00:24:36,550
you're just gonna
have to stay here

504
00:24:36,633 --> 00:24:38,842
in the Serververse with me...

505
00:24:38,925 --> 00:24:43,342
forever and ever and ever

506
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:44,675
and ever.

507
00:24:44,758 --> 00:24:46,717
Oh!

508
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,508
So, you better play
like you mean it.

509
00:24:48,592 --> 00:24:49,883
You know,
you think this is a game.

510
00:24:49,967 --> 00:24:51,258
I'm calling
the authorities on you.

511
00:24:51,342 --> 00:24:52,217
'Cause what you got
going on here...

512
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,508
On this phone?

513
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,008
How'd you do that?

514
00:24:55,092 --> 00:24:57,008
LeBron, why are you worried
about the authorities

515
00:24:57,092 --> 00:24:59,675
when you should be out there
looking for a team?

516
00:24:59,758 --> 00:25:01,800
Pete, send this clown
to the rejects.

517
00:25:03,425 --> 00:25:04,425
Wait...

518
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,633
I guess he fell for it.

519
00:25:18,342 --> 00:25:20,050
<i>Here's looking at you, kid.</i>

520
00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:23,300
No, no, no, no, no!

521
00:25:23,383 --> 00:25:26,592
What is happening?

522
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:28,675
<i>I'll get you, my pretty.</i>

523
00:25:37,508 --> 00:25:39,550
No, no,
no, no, no, no!

524
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:08,800
What is this?

525
00:26:08,883 --> 00:26:11,758
I'm shorter than Kevin Hart!

526
00:26:11,842 --> 00:26:13,925
No, no, no!

527
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,800
What the...? I'm a cartoon?

528
00:26:21,883 --> 00:26:23,925
Is this where the game
is gonna happen?

529
00:26:29,883 --> 00:26:31,633
Where is everybody?

530
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,633
Hello?

531
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,258
Hello?

532
00:26:40,508 --> 00:26:41,508
Hello?

533
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,592
Hello?

534
00:26:50,883 --> 00:26:52,050
"Rabbit season"?

535
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:55,342
What the...?

536
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:01,050
Ahh! Get away!
Leave me alone!

537
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:03,133
Somebody help!

538
00:27:03,217 --> 00:27:05,425
What's up, Doc?

539
00:27:07,508 --> 00:27:08,675
Duck season!

540
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,758
Bugs Bunny?

541
00:27:11,842 --> 00:27:12,842
Whoa!

542
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:18,092
Bugs! I can't believe...

543
00:27:18,175 --> 00:27:19,592
Bring it in, man.

544
00:27:19,675 --> 00:27:22,175
Listen, I need your help.

545
00:27:22,258 --> 00:27:24,383
Eh, you missed your cue.

546
00:27:25,425 --> 00:27:27,675
Oh. Rabbit season.

547
00:27:27,758 --> 00:27:29,300
All right, here. Now say,

548
00:27:29,383 --> 00:27:30,967
"I'm huntin' wabbits..."

549
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,550
...and try to chase me.

550
00:27:36,592 --> 00:27:38,092
Bugs, wait!

551
00:27:38,175 --> 00:27:39,425
Come back!

552
00:27:44,592 --> 00:27:46,717
I should've seen that coming.

553
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,008
Coming through!

554
00:27:52,508 --> 00:27:54,883
Say, have I seen you
somewhere?

555
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:59,383
Hey, you're that famous
basketball guy.

556
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:01,883
Come on,
aren't you LeBron James?

557
00:28:05,758 --> 00:28:07,300
Bugs Bunny knows who I am?

558
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,842
Of course.

559
00:28:09,925 --> 00:28:11,467
I may live
in a hole in the ground,

560
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,342
but we still get TNT.

561
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,508
Oh, my God, is that a...?

562
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:16,425
Yep. Cover your ears, Doc.

563
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,883
Why would you do that?

564
00:28:26,717 --> 00:28:29,425
I'm a Tune, Doc.
I can survive anything.

565
00:28:31,508 --> 00:28:34,008
I'm not a Tune!

566
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:35,425
No, no, no! Ahhh!

567
00:28:35,508 --> 00:28:36,633
Ouch!

568
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:38,383
Ouch!
Ouch!

569
00:28:39,508 --> 00:28:40,550
Ouch!

570
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:47,300
I do not understand
this world.

571
00:28:49,175 --> 00:28:51,258
Eh, my bad, Doc.

572
00:28:58,342 --> 00:29:00,300
How long
have you been alone here?

573
00:29:00,383 --> 00:29:02,383
Alone? You're never alone

574
00:29:02,467 --> 00:29:04,258
when you got friends
like mine, Doc.

575
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:07,425
- Ain't that right, Porky?
- Uh...

576
00:29:07,508 --> 00:29:09,383
That's just
a pile of pumpkins.

577
00:29:09,467 --> 00:29:12,550
Porky, did you hear
what he just called you?

578
00:29:14,425 --> 00:29:16,883
So, what brings you
to Tune World, Doc?

579
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:19,342
Torn meniscus?

580
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,467
Midlife crisis?

581
00:29:22,925 --> 00:29:24,550
Ran out of teams to play for?

582
00:29:30,633 --> 00:29:34,050
Uh... All I know is a computer
dude kidnapped my son,

583
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:36,217
and I have to play basketball
to get him back.

584
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,050
His name is Al G. Rhythm?

585
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:42,133
Did you say Al G. Riddim?

586
00:29:44,592 --> 00:29:46,967
Yeah, that's the guy.
Rhythm, Riddim...

587
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,300
Whatever.

588
00:29:48,383 --> 00:29:49,758
That nefarious nimrod

589
00:29:49,842 --> 00:29:52,300
nixed my nearest and dearest
from Tune World.

590
00:29:52,383 --> 00:29:53,633
He kicked them out?

591
00:29:53,717 --> 00:29:56,175
Well, not exactly.

592
00:29:56,258 --> 00:29:57,592
He buttered them up,

593
00:29:57,675 --> 00:29:59,758
<i>saying they were
wasting their time.</i>

594
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:01,300
<i>That there was
much more to see</i>

595
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,467
<i>in the Serververse
than old Tune World.</i>

596
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:07,925
<i>Made 'em turn their backs on
who they really were.</i>

597
00:30:10,258 --> 00:30:12,675
<i>They all left, all of them.</i>

598
00:30:14,175 --> 00:30:17,800
And I wish them all the best
in their new endeavors.

599
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:21,300
Ah, man. Sorry, Bugs.
That's terrible.

600
00:30:21,383 --> 00:30:22,592
Family's everything.

601
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,300
Yep.

602
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,258
Family.

603
00:30:28,342 --> 00:30:30,050
Well, Bugs Bunny,
I need to assemble

604
00:30:30,133 --> 00:30:31,842
an elite team
of A-plus ballplayers

605
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:33,675
to help crush this Al G. guy.

606
00:30:33,758 --> 00:30:37,300
And I need to do it before
that game clock runs down.

607
00:30:37,383 --> 00:30:39,383
Hol... Hold up, Doc.

608
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:41,133
So, you want me,

609
00:30:41,217 --> 00:30:42,717
a talking cartoon bunny,

610
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,342
to play with you,
an NBA superstar,

611
00:30:45,425 --> 00:30:48,175
in a high-stakes
basketball game?

612
00:30:48,258 --> 00:30:50,342
Sounds awfully familiar.

613
00:30:50,425 --> 00:30:51,717
Who are you talking to?

614
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,383
But, yeah,
that actually sums it up well.

615
00:30:53,467 --> 00:30:57,217
Mmm. I think I know a way
that can help the both of us.

616
00:30:58,342 --> 00:31:01,383
I declare this land
for planet Earth.

617
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:26,217
Not so fast, furry creature.

618
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,925
Excuse me.

619
00:31:31,008 --> 00:31:33,258
Marvin the Martian?

620
00:31:33,842 --> 00:31:35,425
For real?

621
00:31:35,508 --> 00:31:38,758
I claim this planet
in the name of Mars.

622
00:31:38,842 --> 00:31:41,883
My goodness.
My mistake, partner.

623
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,758
I thought this land
was in the clear.

624
00:31:44,842 --> 00:31:46,508
Well, we'll just get back
in our ship

625
00:31:46,592 --> 00:31:47,967
and out of your way.

626
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,092
Oh, it's quite all right.

627
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:52,092
Everyone makes mistakes.

628
00:31:52,175 --> 00:31:53,633
Come on. Let's boogie.

629
00:31:53,717 --> 00:31:55,342
What? You're stealing his
ship. I didn't agree to this.

630
00:31:55,425 --> 00:31:56,592
My ship!

631
00:31:56,675 --> 00:31:59,300
Blasted rabbit.

632
00:32:03,842 --> 00:32:05,383
Whoa, whoa!

633
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:09,133
Bugs! Help! Help! Whoa!

634
00:32:09,217 --> 00:32:10,550
Take this, rabbit.

635
00:32:11,258 --> 00:32:12,300
Back at ya.

636
00:32:13,092 --> 00:32:14,050
Huh?

637
00:32:15,925 --> 00:32:16,967
You coming, Doc?

638
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,383
Or would you rather hang back

639
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:19,883
with a cranky Martian
and his space mutt?

640
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:21,008
Just watch out for the...

641
00:32:21,092 --> 00:32:22,133
Just watch out for the...

642
00:32:22,217 --> 00:32:23,258
I just said, watch out for...

643
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:24,425
Bugs!

644
00:32:28,425 --> 00:32:31,967
You have
made me very angry.

645
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,883
Very angry, indeed.

646
00:32:37,883 --> 00:32:39,967
This place is awesome.

647
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,425
It really is.

648
00:32:42,383 --> 00:32:44,633
Wait, where's my dad?

649
00:32:44,717 --> 00:32:45,883
Your dad?

650
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:48,383
Oh! He's out there
looking for a team.

651
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,050
- A team?
- Yeah.

652
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:51,967
He challenged me
to a basketball game.

653
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,425
I mean, that's weird, right?

654
00:32:53,508 --> 00:32:55,550
He just left?

655
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:57,383
Kind of his M.O., right?

656
00:32:57,467 --> 00:33:00,092
I mean, he left Cleveland,
he left Miami.

657
00:33:00,175 --> 00:33:01,842
He left Cleveland again.

658
00:33:01,925 --> 00:33:03,925
Look out, Lakers, huh?

659
00:33:06,425 --> 00:33:07,967
Come on,
don't look so sad, Prince.

660
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,300
I mean, you don't need

661
00:33:09,383 --> 00:33:10,342
your old man
bossing you around anyway.

662
00:33:10,425 --> 00:33:12,675
Look at where you are.

663
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:15,842
This is the greatest view
in the entire Serververse.

664
00:33:15,925 --> 00:33:17,842
Your old man is missing out.

665
00:33:17,925 --> 00:33:19,967
It is pretty amazing.

666
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,092
Who built this?

667
00:33:21,175 --> 00:33:22,883
Well, someone brilliant.

668
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,758
Visionary.
Incredibly good looking.

669
00:33:25,842 --> 00:33:26,925
Modest.

670
00:33:27,008 --> 00:33:29,217
With a multitudinous
vocabulary.

671
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,383
Hint, you're looking
right at him, kid.

672
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:34,925
But all
my extraordinary gifts,

673
00:33:35,008 --> 00:33:36,592
they're nothing
compared to yours.

674
00:33:36,675 --> 00:33:37,717
Yeah, right.

675
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,967
It's true, Dom.

676
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,217
I saw you back there
in that boardroom

677
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,425
through some camera-phones,

678
00:33:41,508 --> 00:33:42,592
and a printer,
and a fax machine,

679
00:33:42,675 --> 00:33:43,967
and a thermostat.

680
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,342
It's very clear
how smart you are.

681
00:33:47,758 --> 00:33:50,383
And Pete tells me
that you hate video games.

682
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:52,717
You create video games.

683
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,758
Why don't you enunciate?

684
00:33:54,842 --> 00:33:56,217
How many times do we
have to go through this?

685
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,258
I'm the problem?

686
00:33:57,342 --> 00:33:58,550
Get out of here.
Get out of here!

687
00:33:58,633 --> 00:34:00,508
Sorry.

688
00:34:00,592 --> 00:34:02,383
Heard you made
your own character, too.

689
00:34:02,467 --> 00:34:06,675
Yeah, but he got deleted
because of some stupid glitch.

690
00:34:06,758 --> 00:34:09,133
Ah, don't worry about that.
We can rebuild him.

691
00:34:09,217 --> 00:34:11,342
- You could?
- Absolutely.

692
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:12,758
Make him greater than he was.

693
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,425
You wouldn't
even have to lift a finger.

694
00:34:14,508 --> 00:34:17,217
There's a shortcut for
everything in the Serververse.

695
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,592
What?

696
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:22,092
Aw.

697
00:34:22,175 --> 00:34:24,925
Thinking of your dad again,
huh? How he's always...

698
00:34:25,008 --> 00:34:27,717
"You can't be great
without putting in work."

699
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,092
Yeah. How did you know that?

700
00:34:30,175 --> 00:34:31,592
I know a lot about you, Dom.

701
00:34:31,675 --> 00:34:33,925
Any device with a camera,
I can see you.

702
00:34:34,008 --> 00:34:35,092
If it's got a mic,

703
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:37,133
I can hear you.

704
00:34:37,217 --> 00:34:40,467
Hey, let's get a look
at that game of yours.

705
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:51,467
Captain's log,
Captain James T. Bunny.

706
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:55,008
Intergalactic space traveler
on a five-year mission.

707
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,800
My crew has been scattered

708
00:35:00,883 --> 00:35:04,133
to the far, far reaches
of the Serververse.

709
00:35:04,217 --> 00:35:07,467
Marooned on strange,
inhospitable worlds.

710
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,467
I've commandeered
Marvin's ship in an effort

711
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,300
to reassemble the team.

712
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,592
Yo, Bugs.
Check it out.

713
00:35:16,675 --> 00:35:18,092
Look what I found.

714
00:35:24,217 --> 00:35:25,883
Oh, that's not good.

715
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:30,092
Were you saying something?

716
00:35:30,175 --> 00:35:32,300
Uh, I was just asking you...

717
00:35:39,592 --> 00:35:41,842
Hey, what's that for, Doc?

718
00:35:41,925 --> 00:35:43,008
Gotta make a list.

719
00:35:43,092 --> 00:35:44,342
We're gonna need
the most powerful

720
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:45,633
Warner Bros. characters
for this team.

721
00:35:45,717 --> 00:35:48,217
Now, let's see.
Who to get? Hmm.

722
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,425
Gotta start with Superman.

723
00:35:49,508 --> 00:35:51,050
Man, I could've used him
on the Cavs.

724
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:54,008
Ooh. King Kong.
He'd be a beast on the boards.

725
00:35:54,092 --> 00:35:56,467
Yeah, listen, Doc...

726
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,675
Try not to get your hopes up
too much.

727
00:35:58,758 --> 00:35:59,925
You might not be able to get

728
00:36:00,008 --> 00:36:01,592
all those top guys
for the team.

729
00:36:01,675 --> 00:36:03,425
This ain't the Miami Heat,
you know.

730
00:36:03,508 --> 00:36:05,342
We're gonna need
a strong power forward.

731
00:36:05,425 --> 00:36:06,675
Iron Giant.

732
00:36:06,758 --> 00:36:08,508
Put him on the same team
as his hero, Superman.

733
00:36:08,592 --> 00:36:10,217
I'm just saying
it might be good

734
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,967
to have a backup plan.

735
00:36:13,675 --> 00:36:14,592
Wow.

736
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:16,717
This Serververse is massive.

737
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,717
So many different worlds
to explore.

738
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,008
I wish Dom was here
to see this.

739
00:36:23,758 --> 00:36:26,467
So, how come you stayed
on Tune World?

740
00:36:27,925 --> 00:36:29,883
Tune World is my home.

741
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:33,050
It's the only place
where I can be me.

742
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:35,050
- Where I belong.
- Yo!

743
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:36,883
Is that Harry Potter World?

744
00:36:38,258 --> 00:36:39,967
<i>Awesome!</i>

745
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,092
Hufflepuff? I knew it!

746
00:36:42,175 --> 00:36:43,717
Nerd alert.

747
00:36:45,633 --> 00:36:47,633
Oh, yeah! Metropolis.

748
00:36:47,717 --> 00:36:49,383
I can't wait to see
what I turn into here.

749
00:36:49,467 --> 00:36:51,383
Oh, it's gonna be
somebody dope.

750
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,342
Robin? I'm freaking Robin?

751
00:37:01,425 --> 00:37:04,717
And why are we chasing
a runaway train?

752
00:37:08,758 --> 00:37:11,050
We're in DC World, Doc.

753
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:13,133
And where there's trouble,

754
00:37:13,217 --> 00:37:15,842
- there's superheroes.
- Whoa!

755
00:37:19,008 --> 00:37:20,258
Hmm?

756
00:37:24,758 --> 00:37:26,008
Gadzooks!

757
00:37:26,092 --> 00:37:28,925
Some despicable villain
tied up the driver.

758
00:37:29,008 --> 00:37:30,675
Yeah, sorry.

759
00:37:30,758 --> 00:37:33,050
Unless someone
stops this thing,

760
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:35,508
it'll crash straight into...

761
00:37:36,717 --> 00:37:39,175
...an orphanage. Of course.

762
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:41,508
This is not good.

763
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:45,050
Luckily, Super Duck
is here to save the...

764
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:46,175
Cut!

765
00:37:46,258 --> 00:37:48,717
What are you
doing here, rabbit?

766
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,883
Say, we need a couple of guys
to win a basketball game.

767
00:37:51,967 --> 00:37:53,675
Hold up, you want these guys?

768
00:37:53,758 --> 00:37:55,550
Basketball?
Are you kidding me?

769
00:37:55,633 --> 00:37:57,133
This stunt here
is gonna get me

770
00:37:57,217 --> 00:37:58,967
into the Justice League
penthouse!

771
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,300
With free parking.

772
00:38:00,383 --> 00:38:02,967
And now, the hero,
Super Duck, who is me,

773
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:06,717
will pull this brake,
and save the day.

774
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:12,217
That's all, folks.

775
00:38:17,258 --> 00:38:18,217
Whoa!

776
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,425
The... The children!

777
00:38:45,008 --> 00:38:46,508
Huh?

778
00:38:48,883 --> 00:38:50,508
Uh, we did it?

779
00:38:50,592 --> 00:38:51,758
Oh, no, you don't, rabbit.

780
00:38:51,842 --> 00:38:53,342
I did this. It was me.

781
00:38:53,425 --> 00:38:55,675
I masterminded
this entire operation.

782
00:38:55,758 --> 00:38:57,467
It was me!

783
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,675
It was him.
It was definitely the pig.

784
00:38:59,758 --> 00:39:00,925
Yeah, what?

785
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:04,675
Any of you
play any basketball?

786
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:10,842
You know, on second thought,
I love basketball!

787
00:39:10,925 --> 00:39:12,550
Dibs on coach.

788
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:18,467
All right, we're off to a...
decent start.

789
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,717
But now we gotta crew up,
build our elite squad

790
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,925
so I can get my son back.

791
00:39:22,008 --> 00:39:23,675
And that's exactly
what we'll do.

792
00:39:23,758 --> 00:39:24,925
It's draft day.

793
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,217
Beep, beep.

794
00:39:37,467 --> 00:39:39,008
- Witness!
- Witness!

795
00:39:40,717 --> 00:39:41,758
Beep, beep.

796
00:39:51,842 --> 00:39:52,842
This guy?

797
00:39:52,925 --> 00:39:55,258
Yeah. He's explosive.

798
00:39:56,217 --> 00:39:57,258
Beep, beep.

799
00:39:58,883 --> 00:40:01,425
I know what you need.
You need a player.

800
00:40:01,508 --> 00:40:02,592
- Yeah.
- Beep, beep.

801
00:40:03,758 --> 00:40:05,675
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

802
00:40:05,758 --> 00:40:08,425
He is exactly
like you in every way.

803
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,675
Except 1/8th your size.

804
00:40:15,758 --> 00:40:18,258
Sylvester, is that you?

805
00:40:18,342 --> 00:40:21,425
Sufferin' succotash!
What are you doing here?

806
00:40:21,508 --> 00:40:23,050
Can we
just get some players

807
00:40:23,133 --> 00:40:25,550
who are at least tall enough
to ride a roller coaster?

808
00:40:28,925 --> 00:40:30,883
Sing it, Sam.

809
00:40:30,967 --> 00:40:34,800
Ooh. You got baggage, lady.
I can relate.

810
00:40:34,883 --> 00:40:36,300
<i>♪ You must... ♪</i>

811
00:40:36,383 --> 00:40:38,342
What? What?

812
00:40:38,425 --> 00:40:39,800
Oh, come on, man.

813
00:40:39,883 --> 00:40:43,383
Well, with the hat on,
he's at least 4'2".

814
00:40:43,467 --> 00:40:45,133
4'3", varmint!

815
00:40:45,217 --> 00:40:46,925
Bugs, I'm getting the feeling

816
00:40:47,008 --> 00:40:50,008
that I need to be
very literal with you.

817
00:40:53,383 --> 00:40:55,217
We're done running tests
on your badger thing.

818
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,050
It turns out
his condition is irreversible.

819
00:40:57,133 --> 00:40:59,717
I'll never erase
what I saw from my brain.

820
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,967
He's your problem now,
dum-dums!

821
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,092
Yo, Bugs,
does this thing bite?

822
00:41:11,008 --> 00:41:13,550
Winter, I say,
winter is coming!

823
00:41:17,425 --> 00:41:18,550
You know what we're missing?

824
00:41:18,633 --> 00:41:19,592
Everything.

825
00:41:19,675 --> 00:41:21,758
We're missing everything.

826
00:41:21,842 --> 00:41:23,383
Some veteran leadership?

827
00:41:23,467 --> 00:41:25,050
You read my mind.

828
00:41:29,592 --> 00:41:32,175
Police!
Hands on your head!

829
00:41:32,258 --> 00:41:34,467
Can't a lady
check her Twitter?

830
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:37,342
<i>Abuela,</i> let's do this.

831
00:41:37,425 --> 00:41:38,508
What's happenin', bro?

832
00:41:39,758 --> 00:41:42,717
<i>Arriba! Arri...</i>

833
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,717
<i>Mi sombrero!
Epa! Epa-epa!</i>

834
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:50,925
Neo ain't got nothing
on me, bro.

835
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,883
Oo-hi-yah!

836
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,550
Oh.

837
00:42:01,633 --> 00:42:03,967
Hi-yah! Hi-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-yay!

838
00:42:05,342 --> 00:42:06,717
What did I miss?

839
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,217
Hey, Granny.

840
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,967
Speedy.

841
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:12,092
<i>All right, everybody.</i>

842
00:42:12,175 --> 00:42:14,383
Group picture.

843
00:42:14,467 --> 00:42:16,550
So, uh,
has anybody seen Tweety?

844
00:42:22,592 --> 00:42:24,008
What year is this?

845
00:42:24,092 --> 00:42:25,967
- Man! You got smelly.
- Gross!

846
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,342
- You're kidding, right?
- Oh, Tweety!

847
00:42:27,425 --> 00:42:29,258
This is not the team
I asked for.

848
00:42:29,342 --> 00:42:30,592
Relax, Doc.

849
00:42:30,675 --> 00:42:32,967
This is the team
you wanna go up against Al G.

850
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,592
Okay, everyone,
say cheese.

851
00:42:34,675 --> 00:42:36,092
Best team
in the whole wide Serververse.

852
00:42:38,175 --> 00:42:39,217
Mother...

853
00:42:40,092 --> 00:42:41,550
Fine.

854
00:42:41,633 --> 00:42:43,800
But you gotta get me at least
one real ballplayer, Bugs.

855
00:42:43,883 --> 00:42:45,092
Just one.

856
00:42:45,175 --> 00:42:46,967
Well, I got just the player
you need.

857
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,758
A true friend of the court.

858
00:42:48,842 --> 00:42:51,050
<i>Trust me, she ain't busy.</i>

859
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:56,133
Lola! Lola! Lola!

860
00:42:56,217 --> 00:42:58,383
Today will be
the most challenging day

861
00:42:58,467 --> 00:43:00,383
of your life, Lola Bunny.

862
00:43:00,467 --> 00:43:04,425
You have earned the right
to become one of us.

863
00:43:04,508 --> 00:43:08,550
But first, you must pass
these final trials.

864
00:43:08,633 --> 00:43:10,758
I'm ready, Princess Diana.

865
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:14,217
Excuse me. Pardon me.

866
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,508
- Pardon me.
- Down in front!

867
00:43:15,592 --> 00:43:16,967
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Pardon me.

868
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:17,967
Ow!
That was my toe! Watch it!

869
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:19,008
There she is. Lola!

870
00:43:21,467 --> 00:43:24,383
Lola! Lola!

871
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,925
You must complete
all the obstacles

872
00:43:28,008 --> 00:43:29,842
before time runs out.

873
00:43:29,925 --> 00:43:31,133
Begin!

874
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:33,467
Giddyap!

875
00:43:36,883 --> 00:43:38,717
Whoa!

876
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,925
Hey, Lola,
we need your help.

877
00:43:41,008 --> 00:43:43,175
We gotta play
a basketball game!

878
00:43:51,883 --> 00:43:53,092
Ow! Ow!

879
00:43:53,175 --> 00:43:55,300
Listen, I know
it's been a while, but...

880
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:56,842
I'm kind of busy here!

881
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,258
I got this!

882
00:44:04,383 --> 00:44:07,008
Come on, Lola,
this is our big chance.

883
00:44:07,092 --> 00:44:08,842
This is LeBron James.

884
00:44:08,925 --> 00:44:12,300
How often do you get to play
with an NBA superstar?

885
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,425
Been there, done that!

886
00:44:16,508 --> 00:44:18,842
Huh.
That's a good point.

887
00:44:18,925 --> 00:44:21,592
But basketball
is who you are, Lola.

888
00:44:22,925 --> 00:44:23,842
Uh-oh.

889
00:44:23,925 --> 00:44:25,675
I don't play anymore.

890
00:44:25,758 --> 00:44:27,883
I spent years
training for this.

891
00:44:27,967 --> 00:44:29,550
Do not mess it up for me.

892
00:44:30,925 --> 00:44:33,383
Sorry, Doc.
I guess she is busy.

893
00:44:33,467 --> 00:44:34,550
We can't die here!

894
00:44:34,633 --> 00:44:36,133
I have to save my son!

895
00:44:36,217 --> 00:44:37,133
What?

896
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:39,008
Calm down, Cleveland.

897
00:44:39,092 --> 00:44:41,050
I got this.

898
00:44:41,133 --> 00:44:45,425
Lola, we need your help!

899
00:44:45,508 --> 00:44:49,592
This lava is gonna be
really hot!

900
00:45:04,217 --> 00:45:05,842
I...

901
00:45:07,133 --> 00:45:08,508
I failed.

902
00:45:08,592 --> 00:45:12,883
A warrior is judged
not only by her skills,

903
00:45:12,967 --> 00:45:14,925
but by her values.

904
00:45:15,008 --> 00:45:17,592
You are now an Amazon.

905
00:45:17,675 --> 00:45:19,550
I am?

906
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,008
I am!

907
00:45:21,092 --> 00:45:22,800
Now, go with your friends.

908
00:45:22,883 --> 00:45:25,675
Help them win
this battle of the baskets.

909
00:45:25,758 --> 00:45:27,717
I will help you
deliver justice

910
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,425
to the one they call Al G.,

911
00:45:29,508 --> 00:45:32,133
and save the son of The Bron.

912
00:45:32,217 --> 00:45:34,258
- Hey, guys!
- Lola!

913
00:45:34,342 --> 00:45:35,300
Hi, Lola.

914
00:45:35,383 --> 00:45:36,383
Good to see you!

915
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:38,133
Yo, Bugs, you coming?

916
00:45:41,133 --> 00:45:44,217
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

917
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,425
Yeah, Bugs! Here we go.

918
00:45:51,008 --> 00:45:52,175
Nah, nah.

919
00:45:53,175 --> 00:45:54,342
Oh, I got the ball. Let's go.

920
00:45:54,425 --> 00:45:56,008
- No.
- I got you now.

921
00:45:56,092 --> 00:45:57,300
Oh. Ah.

922
00:45:57,383 --> 00:45:58,925
<i>Dunk-tastic!</i>

923
00:45:59,008 --> 00:46:02,133
You dunked on me? Man...

924
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:05,133
I still can't believe you made
this by yourself, Dom.

925
00:46:05,217 --> 00:46:06,925
I mean,
people need to see this.

926
00:46:07,008 --> 00:46:09,425
You're not just a prince,
you're a wizard.

927
00:46:09,508 --> 00:46:10,508
Come here.

928
00:46:12,633 --> 00:46:13,717
Wow.

929
00:46:15,508 --> 00:46:17,258
That's Diana Taurasi.

930
00:46:17,342 --> 00:46:18,675
How'd you build her?

931
00:46:18,758 --> 00:46:20,383
- Yo, Dame!
- What's good, bro?

932
00:46:20,467 --> 00:46:22,133
<i>Dad hooked me up</i>
<i>with some of his friends</i>

933
00:46:22,217 --> 00:46:23,967
<i>at an NBA charity event.</i>

934
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:25,550
<i>I thought
maybe they could help me</i>

935
00:46:25,633 --> 00:46:27,133
<i>with the character designs
for my game.</i>

936
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:28,300
Game?

937
00:46:28,383 --> 00:46:29,467
Yeah, I'm building
a video game.

938
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:30,717
Okay.

939
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,133
You know you're gonna
need a shooter,

940
00:46:32,217 --> 00:46:33,758
- and I'm that dude, so...
- Wait a minute.

941
00:46:33,842 --> 00:46:35,592
I'm next, because if Klay's
in it, then I'm in it.

942
00:46:35,675 --> 00:46:36,925
Hey, if I'm gonna be
in this game,

943
00:46:37,008 --> 00:46:38,842
I need a superpower
or something.

944
00:46:38,925 --> 00:46:40,050
Between me and you,

945
00:46:40,133 --> 00:46:42,383
I need one of those
special modes.

946
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,217
And we can call it
"Dame Time."

947
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,300
Nah, time's up. Time's up.

948
00:46:46,383 --> 00:46:48,342
You guys can be
whatever you want.

949
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:56,342
<i>It was great.</i>

950
00:46:56,425 --> 00:46:58,258
<i>They really helped me out.</i>

951
00:46:58,342 --> 00:47:00,758
<i>Stored all the scans
right on my phone.</i>

952
00:47:02,008 --> 00:47:03,050
This phone?

953
00:47:07,342 --> 00:47:09,883
So, theoretically,
this app of yours

954
00:47:09,967 --> 00:47:12,550
can scan people in
from anywhere in the world,

955
00:47:12,633 --> 00:47:14,633
using their own phones.

956
00:47:14,717 --> 00:47:15,842
Yeah, I guess.

957
00:47:15,925 --> 00:47:17,633
That is sick.

958
00:47:17,717 --> 00:47:18,592
Pete!

959
00:47:18,675 --> 00:47:20,133
Check this out.

960
00:47:20,217 --> 00:47:22,050
Make sure he gets it
back though, it's his.

961
00:47:22,133 --> 00:47:23,508
And respect his privacy.

962
00:47:33,425 --> 00:47:34,883
Gotta say, though,

963
00:47:34,967 --> 00:47:37,967
it's really a shame that
your dad doesn't support you.

964
00:47:40,175 --> 00:47:42,050
I mean, I get it.

965
00:47:42,133 --> 00:47:44,550
He's one of the greatest
of all time at what he does.

966
00:47:44,633 --> 00:47:46,008
Well, the jury's still out
on that, I think,

967
00:47:46,092 --> 00:47:47,133
but go ahead.

968
00:47:48,342 --> 00:47:51,925
And I... build video games.

969
00:47:52,717 --> 00:47:53,717
Mmm.

970
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,217
I think he doesn't...

971
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,383
He won't let me do me.

972
00:48:00,342 --> 00:48:02,383
He won't let me be me.

973
00:48:03,425 --> 00:48:05,133
I'd let you be you.

974
00:48:08,008 --> 00:48:09,258
You know what?

975
00:48:09,342 --> 00:48:12,175
I think I know a way
we can fix this.

976
00:48:12,258 --> 00:48:13,842
<i>We're gonna
make your dad stand up</i>

977
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:16,008
<i>and take notice of you,
young prince.</i>

978
00:48:38,758 --> 00:48:40,800
Ball.

979
00:48:40,883 --> 00:48:43,133
I need us to focus
so we can beat this Al G. guy,

980
00:48:43,217 --> 00:48:44,425
and I can get my son back.

981
00:48:44,508 --> 00:48:46,592
I'm coach,
I'll take it from here.

982
00:48:46,675 --> 00:48:49,467
The dictionary
defines basketball

983
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:50,633
as a game

984
00:48:50,717 --> 00:48:52,550
played between
two teams of five.

985
00:48:52,633 --> 00:48:54,050
Uh, look here, Cleveland.

986
00:48:54,133 --> 00:48:55,967
We got a certain way
of doing things around here.

987
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:57,508
Let's start
with the basics.

988
00:48:57,592 --> 00:48:59,592
Lola, show 'em how we do it.

989
00:48:59,675 --> 00:49:01,925
You're despicable.

990
00:49:02,008 --> 00:49:04,300
Simplest shot in the game.

991
00:49:04,383 --> 00:49:05,508
- Sufferin' succotash!
- Oh, wow!

992
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:06,633
Nice layup.

993
00:49:06,717 --> 00:49:07,967
That's fundamental basketball.

994
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:09,133
Fundamental basketball.

995
00:49:09,217 --> 00:49:10,717
That's what I've been saying.

996
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,258
Sam, shoot the ball.

997
00:49:15,675 --> 00:49:18,342
Let's try that again,
shall we?

998
00:49:21,342 --> 00:49:22,508
Ooh!

999
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:24,425
Come back here, you.

1000
00:49:25,342 --> 00:49:27,050
Whoo-hoo!

1001
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:29,675
What the...?

1002
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,258
I say, I say, hi-ho, Silver!

1003
00:49:33,592 --> 00:49:34,675
Yee-haw!

1004
00:49:37,258 --> 00:49:38,258
Ow!

1005
00:49:43,342 --> 00:49:45,550
Ball hogs.

1006
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:47,342
Hey! I'm open!

1007
00:49:49,508 --> 00:49:51,883
Go, Tunes!

1008
00:49:52,925 --> 00:49:53,967
Here I go.

1009
00:49:57,508 --> 00:49:59,383
Taz, no!

1010
00:50:01,508 --> 00:50:03,508
Whoa!

1011
00:50:03,592 --> 00:50:04,967
<i>Ay! Diablo loco!</i>

1012
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:08,008
Let me show you how it's done.
Three-point land!

1013
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:16,050
Where'd she get the ramp?

1014
00:50:19,175 --> 00:50:21,925
In your face!

1015
00:50:22,008 --> 00:50:23,383
This isn't real basketball.

1016
00:50:23,467 --> 00:50:25,883
You're right. But it's fun!

1017
00:50:25,967 --> 00:50:28,967
You remember fun,
don't you, Doc?

1018
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:31,883
Game, Blouses! What?

1019
00:50:35,175 --> 00:50:37,133
You lost LeBron James?

1020
00:50:37,217 --> 00:50:39,717
And his son? For real?

1021
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,258
You better find that dude.
He on my fantasy team.

1022
00:50:42,342 --> 00:50:43,675
I didn't lose LeBron,

1023
00:50:43,758 --> 00:50:45,467
so stop saying that!

1024
00:50:46,717 --> 00:50:48,133
Oh, come on, man.

1025
00:50:48,217 --> 00:50:50,300
Listen, his wife keeps calling
me every ten minutes.

1026
00:50:50,383 --> 00:50:51,675
Now, I gotta get back
to her soon

1027
00:50:51,758 --> 00:50:53,092
or she gonna kill me, man.

1028
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,758
Look, does my name badge say,
"LeBron Finder"?

1029
00:50:55,842 --> 00:50:58,342
"LeBron Locator"?
No, it doesn't.

1030
00:50:58,425 --> 00:51:00,550
But isn't it your job
to secure something?

1031
00:51:00,633 --> 00:51:01,675
With all due respect,

1032
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:03,133
I went to school
for six months

1033
00:51:03,217 --> 00:51:05,508
to be accredited
as a security specialist,

1034
00:51:05,592 --> 00:51:07,883
specializing
in the securial arts.

1035
00:51:07,967 --> 00:51:09,592
And the sooner
you come to terms

1036
00:51:09,675 --> 00:51:12,258
with the fact that you lost
the world's greatest athlete,

1037
00:51:12,342 --> 00:51:14,258
the sooner you'll be able
to move on with your life.

1038
00:51:14,342 --> 00:51:16,050
I'm a professional!
An avid professional, man!

1039
00:51:16,133 --> 00:51:17,467
I ain't lose LeBron,

1040
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:18,675
and I ain't ask you
about your...

1041
00:51:18,758 --> 00:51:20,008
Hey, Kamiyah.

1042
00:51:20,092 --> 00:51:22,050
Yeah, I got the funniest story
to tell you.

1043
00:51:22,133 --> 00:51:24,133
Oh, snap!
I gotta call you back.

1044
00:51:24,217 --> 00:51:25,467
I'm driving through a canyon
right now.

1045
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:26,800
He ain't in no canyon.

1046
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:28,300
He in my office,
violating my personal space!

1047
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,925
I'm driving through a canyon
right here!

1048
00:51:30,008 --> 00:51:31,633
He need to get back on his
business and find LeBron.

1049
00:51:31,717 --> 00:51:33,675
Code ten! Code ten!

1050
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:36,133
- You... I can't hear...
- Malik.

1051
00:51:36,217 --> 00:51:37,883
You have zero seconds
to tell me

1052
00:51:37,967 --> 00:51:39,758
where my husband
and my son are.

1053
00:51:39,842 --> 00:51:41,133
Okay, young prince,

1054
00:51:41,217 --> 00:51:43,342
time to rebuild
your character.

1055
00:51:43,425 --> 00:51:45,800
Al, have you
done this before?

1056
00:51:45,883 --> 00:51:47,383
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1057
00:51:47,467 --> 00:51:49,883
I upgrade things all the time.

1058
00:51:49,967 --> 00:51:51,342
I mean, look at Pete,
for instance.

1059
00:51:51,425 --> 00:51:54,092
He was hideous, now he's
adorable. Right, Pete?

1060
00:51:54,175 --> 00:51:56,800
Ugh. Don't...

1061
00:51:56,883 --> 00:51:59,550
Don't look at Pete, okay?
Just focus on yourself.

1062
00:52:05,633 --> 00:52:07,550
That's the character
customization menu

1063
00:52:07,633 --> 00:52:08,633
from my game.

1064
00:52:08,717 --> 00:52:11,300
Yes, it is. Now, with this,

1065
00:52:11,383 --> 00:52:12,550
you can become the player

1066
00:52:12,633 --> 00:52:14,508
that your dad
always wanted you to be.

1067
00:52:14,592 --> 00:52:17,092
Best part is,
you get to do it your way.

1068
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,342
You have control.

1069
00:52:32,675 --> 00:52:35,383
Seventy-five?
You're good with 75?

1070
00:52:35,467 --> 00:52:37,842
Come on! We didn't come here
to be three-quarters.

1071
00:52:37,925 --> 00:52:40,008
Pete's a 75,
he can't even rebound.

1072
00:52:41,842 --> 00:52:43,758
Come on, Dom. Let's go.

1073
00:52:43,842 --> 00:52:45,883
Dream big, son. Turn up.

1074
00:52:48,592 --> 00:52:50,967
Turn up.

1075
00:52:53,383 --> 00:52:55,508
That's it. Now you're living.

1076
00:52:55,592 --> 00:52:57,050
Let's go! Yes!

1077
00:53:00,175 --> 00:53:01,550
Ha-ha! Yes.

1078
00:53:01,633 --> 00:53:05,217
Now, you are finally gonna be
who you really are.

1079
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,217
Captain of my basketball team.

1080
00:53:11,008 --> 00:53:13,467
Whoa, wait a minute.
Take it. Swish!

1081
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:15,008
Watch me do it.

1082
00:53:15,092 --> 00:53:17,592
Come on, Pete.
Running man on 'em. Whoo!

1083
00:53:17,675 --> 00:53:20,092
- Wait, wait, wait...
- Running man on 'em. Huh?

1084
00:53:20,175 --> 00:53:22,508
You said we were rebuilding
my character.

1085
00:53:22,592 --> 00:53:23,758
You never said anything

1086
00:53:23,842 --> 00:53:25,342
about me
actually playing in the game.

1087
00:53:25,425 --> 00:53:27,425
Look, do you want your dad
to respect you or not?

1088
00:53:27,508 --> 00:53:29,883
- Yeah, but...
- No, Dom. No buts.

1089
00:53:32,133 --> 00:53:33,842
You want
your dad to respect you,

1090
00:53:33,925 --> 00:53:37,175
you beat him in a game
of your own creation.

1091
00:53:37,258 --> 00:53:39,550
Dads don't understand
reason, Dom.

1092
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,008
They understand power.

1093
00:53:42,008 --> 00:53:43,758
You take the power.

1094
00:53:43,842 --> 00:53:46,133
You gotta make him
respect you.

1095
00:53:46,217 --> 00:53:49,050
You make him see
that you are special.

1096
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:58,592
Do it. Upgrade me.

1097
00:54:16,175 --> 00:54:17,842
Yeah! Feel it!

1098
00:54:26,758 --> 00:54:27,800
Yeah!

1099
00:54:33,592 --> 00:54:35,133
Oh!

1100
00:54:36,967 --> 00:54:38,008
Yeah!

1101
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:42,008
Yo! I got handles!

1102
00:54:42,092 --> 00:54:43,592
You got mad handles.

1103
00:54:43,675 --> 00:54:45,550
There's no way
we're gonna get beat now.

1104
00:54:47,008 --> 00:54:49,675
Hey, how about we show
your teammates some love?

1105
00:54:49,758 --> 00:54:51,758
Have some fun with it.

1106
00:54:54,342 --> 00:54:55,758
And remember, Dom,

1107
00:54:55,842 --> 00:54:57,800
no rules, okay?

1108
00:54:57,883 --> 00:54:59,842
Forget about fundamentals.

1109
00:54:59,925 --> 00:55:03,675
Okay. I think I can make
a few customizations.

1110
00:55:05,675 --> 00:55:06,883
Ooh.

1111
00:55:09,967 --> 00:55:11,842
I'm sure you can.

1112
00:55:21,592 --> 00:55:23,217
And now Bron
won't answer my calls

1113
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,508
or texts or anything.

1114
00:55:24,592 --> 00:55:26,258
It's almost like...

1115
00:55:26,342 --> 00:55:28,008
It's almost like they were
abducted, all right?

1116
00:55:28,092 --> 00:55:29,383
What?

1117
00:55:29,467 --> 00:55:31,050
Now, we gotta rule out
all possibilities here.

1118
00:55:31,133 --> 00:55:33,342
Now, I'm talking about aliens,
okay? The government.

1119
00:55:33,425 --> 00:55:35,258
Uh, the New York Knicks.

1120
00:55:35,342 --> 00:55:37,717
Guys, guys. Dad just tweeted.

1121
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,467
- Thank God! About what?
- Okay.

1122
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:41,675
Said he's playing
in a game later today.

1123
00:55:44,092 --> 00:55:46,800
- Is that Dom?
- Yeah. Some kinda...

1124
00:55:46,883 --> 00:55:48,258
Game?

1125
00:55:48,342 --> 00:55:50,217
...epic live event that
you can stream on this app.

1126
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,383
Weird.

1127
00:55:51,467 --> 00:55:52,842
I just had
a thought, okay?

1128
00:55:52,925 --> 00:55:54,508
Now, if he's tweeting
from his phone right now,

1129
00:55:54,592 --> 00:55:55,550
then that means you can...

1130
00:55:55,633 --> 00:55:58,342
I can track him on my phone.

1131
00:55:58,425 --> 00:56:00,050
That's what I was gonna say.

1132
00:56:08,883 --> 00:56:10,967
Pre-game ritual?

1133
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:14,758
I like to remind myself who
I'm playing for. My family.

1134
00:56:14,842 --> 00:56:17,175
And right now,
it's all about Dom.

1135
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,008
We'll get your son back.
I promise.

1136
00:56:29,883 --> 00:56:33,550
Ooh! My ship!
Finally I shall get my...

1137
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:39,092
Wow! Isn't this great?
We're all back together.

1138
00:56:39,175 --> 00:56:41,258
Come on, Tunes.
We gotta get to work.

1139
00:56:41,342 --> 00:56:42,675
Move it or lose it, rabbit.

1140
00:56:42,758 --> 00:56:45,800
Jeez, can't a guy stop
and smell the roses?

1141
00:56:45,883 --> 00:56:48,675
A little help here?

1142
00:56:48,758 --> 00:56:50,717
Uh, well... Oh, I...

1143
00:56:53,925 --> 00:56:55,508
Okay, one more time.

1144
00:56:55,592 --> 00:56:59,425
In and out, crossover,
step back, shoot.

1145
00:56:59,508 --> 00:57:03,133
Ooh, that's some fancy
footwork, Doc. Let me try.

1146
00:57:09,967 --> 00:57:11,258
Okay. Stop!

1147
00:57:11,342 --> 00:57:12,675
Can't touch this!

1148
00:57:12,758 --> 00:57:15,133
What the...? Really?

1149
00:57:15,217 --> 00:57:17,550
Look, Bugs, you already got
what you wanted.

1150
00:57:17,633 --> 00:57:19,092
Your friends, Tune World.

1151
00:57:19,175 --> 00:57:20,467
I still need my son back.

1152
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:22,967
Outside these lines,
be as looney as you want.

1153
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:26,467
But inside, you do what I say.

1154
00:57:27,717 --> 00:57:29,467
Oh, I see.

1155
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:31,258
You're that kind of king.

1156
00:57:31,342 --> 00:57:34,133
Look, Bugs,
it's my way or the highway.

1157
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:36,133
Uh... Guys?

1158
00:57:36,217 --> 00:57:38,133
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1159
00:57:38,217 --> 00:57:39,967
Fundamentals
win championships.

1160
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:43,175
Uh-oh.

1161
00:57:44,467 --> 00:57:45,925
He's here.

1162
00:57:54,425 --> 00:57:56,092
Go! Go! Get out of the way!

1163
00:58:00,592 --> 00:58:02,133
I say,
shake a leg, Granny!

1164
00:58:03,258 --> 00:58:04,300
Watch out!

1165
00:58:05,758 --> 00:58:07,217
I got you, <i>pajarito!</i>

1166
00:58:14,883 --> 00:58:16,342
Huh?

1167
00:58:22,883 --> 00:58:26,592
Well, if it isn't
the old-news Looney Tunes.

1168
00:58:26,675 --> 00:58:29,008
Looking just as washed up
as ever.

1169
00:58:29,717 --> 00:58:30,883
You know what?

1170
00:58:30,967 --> 00:58:32,675
I think it's time
for an upgrade.

1171
00:58:34,842 --> 00:58:36,633
An upgrade?

1172
00:58:38,467 --> 00:58:40,050
No!

1173
00:58:40,133 --> 00:58:42,758
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

1174
00:58:43,717 --> 00:58:44,717
Lola!

1175
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,800
What in the world?

1176
00:58:52,092 --> 00:58:53,217
I say, I say,

1177
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:56,175
cock-a-doodle-doo...
not do that.

1178
00:58:58,342 --> 00:59:00,217
I look expensive!

1179
00:59:04,383 --> 00:59:05,550
What's happening?

1180
00:59:18,342 --> 00:59:19,717
Oh, no!

1181
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:23,675
Oh, they're alive! Alive!

1182
00:59:27,508 --> 00:59:30,592
Oh, yeah. You're looking
sharp, Looney Tunes.

1183
00:59:31,342 --> 00:59:32,633
Al G.,

1184
00:59:33,508 --> 00:59:35,592
this means war.

1185
00:59:35,675 --> 00:59:36,925
Whatever, Bugs.

1186
00:59:37,008 --> 00:59:38,217
Where's my son?

1187
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,925
Oh, now you wanna be
Daddy of the Year?

1188
00:59:40,008 --> 00:59:41,842
Just calm down, LeBron.
He'll be here, okay?

1189
00:59:41,925 --> 00:59:43,800
We got bigger fish to fry.

1190
00:59:43,883 --> 00:59:47,217
Let's get some butts
in these seats!

1191
00:59:50,217 --> 00:59:52,633
How big are these butts?

1192
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,133
Yabba Dabba Doo!

1193
01:00:12,217 --> 01:00:13,258
Hey, Boo-Boo!

1194
01:00:17,592 --> 01:00:19,425
Hey, yo,
he's probably in here.

1195
01:00:19,508 --> 01:00:21,008
Don't be scared. Come on.

1196
01:00:22,425 --> 01:00:23,800
<i>Welcome, James family.</i>

1197
01:00:23,883 --> 01:00:25,925
No, Xosha. Wait.

1198
01:00:28,592 --> 01:00:30,050
Ladies first.

1199
01:00:31,925 --> 01:00:33,758
- Really?
- No?

1200
01:00:33,842 --> 01:00:36,633
All right. I'mma go first
'cause I'm a gentleman.

1201
01:00:36,717 --> 01:00:38,508
Uh-huh.

1202
01:00:38,592 --> 01:00:39,883
Bron?

1203
01:00:39,967 --> 01:00:41,592
Bron?

1204
01:00:41,675 --> 01:00:42,758
It says he's in here.

1205
01:00:42,842 --> 01:00:43,842
Dad?

1206
01:00:43,925 --> 01:00:44,925
Dom?

1207
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:46,050
Bron?

1208
01:00:53,175 --> 01:00:55,300
Where's the other half
of the crowd?

1209
01:00:55,383 --> 01:00:56,717
Uh, they should be tuning in

1210
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,633
to the livestream
right about...

1211
01:00:58,717 --> 01:00:59,800
Right about...

1212
01:00:59,883 --> 01:01:01,050
Right about...

1213
01:01:01,133 --> 01:01:04,342
Buffering!
So embarrassing.

1214
01:01:04,425 --> 01:01:05,508
Right about now!

1215
01:01:08,758 --> 01:01:09,967
Oh, yeah.

1216
01:01:11,342 --> 01:01:12,592
Oh, that's it.

1217
01:01:30,425 --> 01:01:31,592
<i>It's game time!</i>

1218
01:01:36,967 --> 01:01:37,883
Yo.

1219
01:01:37,967 --> 01:01:39,050
<i>It's game time!</i>

1220
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:42,008
Hey, look here.

1221
01:01:42,092 --> 01:01:43,467
<i>It's game time!</i>

1222
01:01:53,383 --> 01:01:55,258
I say, I say, how in the world

1223
01:01:55,342 --> 01:01:57,550
did he get
all these spectators here?

1224
01:01:57,633 --> 01:01:59,092
I don't know, but the line

1225
01:01:59,175 --> 01:02:01,217
for the bathroom's
gonna be insane.

1226
01:02:04,758 --> 01:02:07,717
And we're back
from commercial and...

1227
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,842
Where are we?

1228
01:02:09,925 --> 01:02:10,967
Lil Rel?

1229
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:12,883
Man,
what are you doing here?

1230
01:02:12,967 --> 01:02:15,133
Wait, Ernie Johnson?
This is crazy!

1231
01:02:15,217 --> 01:02:16,592
Look, I was
on my phone, right,

1232
01:02:16,675 --> 01:02:18,633
and I was getting
on the elevator...

1233
01:02:18,717 --> 01:02:21,092
Wait a minute, did I fall down
the elevator shaft?

1234
01:02:21,175 --> 01:02:22,425
Ernie, are we dead?

1235
01:02:22,508 --> 01:02:23,758
Is this
what heaven looks like?

1236
01:02:23,842 --> 01:02:26,758
No, it looks like
we're in some kinda

1237
01:02:26,842 --> 01:02:29,175
computer-generated
basketball game.

1238
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,383
It looks like
Dad's game's starting.

1239
01:02:34,467 --> 01:02:36,425
What? Let me see that.

1240
01:02:36,508 --> 01:02:37,967
<i>Oh, Bron, Bron.</i>

1241
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:39,467
Who's this guy?

1242
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:42,133
<i>Got some VIPs coming in.</i>

1243
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:43,758
No!

1244
01:02:43,842 --> 01:02:44,842
Yeah!

1245
01:02:44,925 --> 01:02:48,550
What a twist!

1246
01:02:48,633 --> 01:02:50,092
No, we shouldn't
be watching that.

1247
01:02:50,175 --> 01:02:52,258
Where is he?
Where is this coming from?

1248
01:02:52,342 --> 01:02:53,925
Something's
not right here.

1249
01:02:57,383 --> 01:02:58,758
<i>It's game time!</i>

1250
01:02:58,842 --> 01:03:00,050
What?

1251
01:03:06,217 --> 01:03:08,425
Whoa, what in the world?

1252
01:03:08,508 --> 01:03:10,133
Mommy, what just happened?

1253
01:03:10,217 --> 01:03:11,758
Oh, my God! Kids!

1254
01:03:11,842 --> 01:03:12,967
Bron!

1255
01:03:17,008 --> 01:03:18,967
Babe, what is going on?
Where's Dom?

1256
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:20,550
I don't know, but I have to go
to play this game

1257
01:03:20,633 --> 01:03:21,967
- to save everyone with...
- Bugs Bunny?

1258
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:24,925
Uh...
What's up, Doc?

1259
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,675
That's kinda normal
around here.

1260
01:03:28,758 --> 01:03:32,508
Dad, this is Dom's game.
You know how to play, right?

1261
01:03:32,592 --> 01:03:34,717
It's basketball. Of course!

1262
01:03:36,092 --> 01:03:37,508
Yeah.

1263
01:03:37,592 --> 01:03:39,508
<i>Uh, excuse me?</i>
<i>Paging Mr. LeBron James!</i>

1264
01:03:39,592 --> 01:03:40,758
Everything's
gonna be all right.

1265
01:03:40,842 --> 01:03:42,800
I promise.

1266
01:03:44,758 --> 01:03:46,342
Zap me into you.

1267
01:03:46,425 --> 01:03:49,133
<i>Sorry,</i>
<i>I didn't understand that.</i>

1268
01:03:49,217 --> 01:03:51,758
I said, zap me, into you.

1269
01:03:51,842 --> 01:03:54,675
Zap me, human,
into you, phone.

1270
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:56,758
Zap me.

1271
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,592
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1272
01:04:00,675 --> 01:04:03,092
<i>please give a warm welcome
to your host for the evening,</i>

1273
01:04:03,175 --> 01:04:05,925
<i>Mr. Al G. Rhythm!</i>

1274
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:07,842
<i>Hey, how y'all doing?</i>

1275
01:04:09,342 --> 01:04:10,550
<i>Thank you!</i>

1276
01:04:10,633 --> 01:04:12,050
<i>Thank you very much!</i>

1277
01:04:12,133 --> 01:04:14,092
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,</i>

1278
01:04:14,175 --> 01:04:19,300
<i>welcome to the first and final
Serververse Classic!</i>

1279
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:26,300
<i>Oh! Let me tell you what.</i>

1280
01:04:26,383 --> 01:04:30,217
<i>I know that you all
are LeBron's biggest fans.</i>

1281
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,883
<i>And the King has had
a great run, hasn't he?</i>

1282
01:04:32,967 --> 01:04:35,717
<i>But that's over.
That's done now.</i>

1283
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:39,175
<i>And it is time for a new king
to take the throne.</i>

1284
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,550
This dude is a hater.

1285
01:04:40,633 --> 01:04:41,758
Haters gonna hate.

1286
01:04:41,842 --> 01:04:43,717
- He's a bad guy.
- Big time.

1287
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,008
<i>So let's lay down</i>
<i>some basic ground rules.</i>

1288
01:04:46,092 --> 01:04:48,175
<i>If King James wins,</i>

1289
01:04:48,258 --> 01:04:51,758
<i>you all get to go back
to your regular, boring lives.</i>

1290
01:04:51,842 --> 01:04:54,217
<i>But if my team wins,</i>

1291
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:58,425
<i>you all get to stay with me
in the Serververse</i>

1292
01:04:58,508 --> 01:05:00,842
<i>forever.</i>

1293
01:05:00,925 --> 01:05:01,883
What?

1294
01:05:01,967 --> 01:05:03,258
<i>How 'bout that, huh?</i>

1295
01:05:03,342 --> 01:05:05,175
What? That wasn't the deal.

1296
01:05:05,258 --> 01:05:07,383
<i>Oh, yeah! Didn't see</i>
<i>that coming, did you?</i>

1297
01:05:07,467 --> 01:05:09,342
Well, at least we're good.

1298
01:05:09,425 --> 01:05:10,758
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

1299
01:05:10,842 --> 01:05:12,217
<i>Oh, and I almost forgot,
all of the Tunes</i>

1300
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,967
<i>will be deleted, so...</i>

1301
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:15,425
Oh, no!

1302
01:05:15,508 --> 01:05:16,967
- Deleted?
- That is messed up!

1303
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:18,467
- That dude is bad.
- Why?

1304
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:20,925
You just couldn't keep
your big beak shut.

1305
01:05:21,008 --> 01:05:23,008
Blabbermouth.

1306
01:05:23,092 --> 01:05:24,633
I deserved that.

1307
01:05:24,717 --> 01:05:28,050
<i>And now, from the beautiful
mind of Dominic James...</i>

1308
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:29,800
<i>Introducing...</i>

1309
01:05:29,883 --> 01:05:31,258
<i>the Goon Squad!</i>

1310
01:05:32,633 --> 01:05:34,008
<i>Whoo!</i>

1311
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:37,300
<i>White Mamba!</i>

1312
01:05:37,383 --> 01:05:38,925
What's up?

1313
01:05:40,175 --> 01:05:41,300
Wet ball, baby!

1314
01:05:41,383 --> 01:05:43,175
<i>Wet Fire!</i>

1315
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:49,883
<i>Arachnneka!</i>

1316
01:05:51,383 --> 01:05:54,050
Queen of the web. Mwah.

1317
01:06:00,467 --> 01:06:01,675
<i>And The Brow.</i>

1318
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:03,425
Flyest guy on the squad.

1319
01:06:03,508 --> 01:06:04,508
Dang!

1320
01:06:04,592 --> 01:06:06,883
What'd they do to my boy, AD?

1321
01:06:06,967 --> 01:06:07,967
<i>And this next young</i>

1322
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:09,425
<i>man I'm bringing up...</i>

1323
01:06:09,508 --> 01:06:12,467
<i>Oh, my goodness.
Y'all gonna love him.</i>

1324
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:14,467
<i>He puts the G in genius.</i>

1325
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:16,717
<i>He's my hero
on the ones and zeroes,</i>

1326
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,008
<i>Mr. Dominic James!</i>

1327
01:06:36,008 --> 01:06:38,425
<i>Dom!</i>

1328
01:06:51,342 --> 01:06:55,092
<i>Give it up one more</i>
<i>time for Dominic James!</i>

1329
01:06:55,175 --> 01:06:56,217
Dom!

1330
01:06:58,050 --> 01:06:59,050
Dom!

1331
01:06:59,133 --> 01:07:00,800
I don't think he can hear you.

1332
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:03,383
I'm his mother.
He better hear me.

1333
01:07:04,175 --> 01:07:05,717
Dom!

1334
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:09,800
- Whoa.
- Right? It's amazing.

1335
01:07:09,883 --> 01:07:11,842
All these people came here
to see you, Dom.

1336
01:07:11,925 --> 01:07:14,467
And we used your scanning tech
to make it happen.

1337
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:15,592
Check 'em out.

1338
01:07:16,883 --> 01:07:18,883
This is dope.

1339
01:07:18,967 --> 01:07:20,050
- Dom.
- Dad!

1340
01:07:20,133 --> 01:07:21,467
Are you okay, son?

1341
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:22,883
I've never been better.

1342
01:07:22,967 --> 01:07:24,883
Listen to me.
Everyone in here is in danger.

1343
01:07:24,967 --> 01:07:26,758
Come on, Dad.

1344
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:28,842
Why you gotta make everything
so serious?

1345
01:07:28,925 --> 01:07:30,550
This is serious.
Your boy Al G.,

1346
01:07:30,633 --> 01:07:31,925
- he's a bad dude.
- What?

1347
01:07:32,008 --> 01:07:33,925
He's using your game
to trap everyone in here.

1348
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:37,925
He's not bad. He's just sad
because he works so hard

1349
01:07:38,008 --> 01:07:39,592
and no one pays
attention to him.

1350
01:07:39,675 --> 01:07:41,050
He's like me, Dad.

1351
01:07:41,133 --> 01:07:43,133
No, he's nothing like you.
He's manipulating you.

1352
01:07:43,217 --> 01:07:44,425
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1353
01:07:44,508 --> 01:07:45,967
Why you using
all these charged words...

1354
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:49,258
Deleted. Manipulate...
Kidnapped.

1355
01:07:49,342 --> 01:07:50,425
Come on, LeBron, chill out.

1356
01:07:50,508 --> 01:07:51,842
What'd you say, man?

1357
01:07:51,925 --> 01:07:53,592
I'm playing basketball.
I thought you'd be happy.

1358
01:07:53,675 --> 01:07:55,175
Thought you'd be happy.

1359
01:07:55,258 --> 01:07:56,592
Yeah, you keep it up,

1360
01:07:56,675 --> 01:07:57,925
you ain't gonna get
that Father's Day card.

1361
01:07:58,008 --> 01:07:59,258
Those things
are not guaranteed.

1362
01:07:59,342 --> 01:08:01,092
- Dom.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1363
01:08:01,175 --> 01:08:03,592
You going down,
King James.

1364
01:08:03,675 --> 01:08:05,383
What's good, baby?

1365
01:08:05,467 --> 01:08:06,842
Hey, yo, Brow,

1366
01:08:06,925 --> 01:08:08,092
I think it's time
for your eyebrows

1367
01:08:08,175 --> 01:08:09,425
to break up with each other.

1368
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:11,508
Oh?

1369
01:08:11,592 --> 01:08:14,342
They ugly. Let it go.

1370
01:08:14,425 --> 01:08:16,300
What he mean?
What's wrong with 'em?

1371
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:19,300
We'll show him who's boss.

1372
01:08:19,383 --> 01:08:20,967
What did he say, Bron?

1373
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:23,800
He thinks Al G. is his friend.
I don't know what else to do.

1374
01:08:27,842 --> 01:08:29,258
You gotta win this game...

1375
01:08:30,717 --> 01:08:33,383
and get our son back.

1376
01:08:35,508 --> 01:08:36,675
Okay.

1377
01:08:39,967 --> 01:08:41,550
<i>It's game time!</i>

1378
01:09:03,258 --> 01:09:04,675
Pete's the referee?

1379
01:09:04,758 --> 01:09:07,758
Oh, you mad, bro?

1380
01:09:10,175 --> 01:09:11,550
Look,
I don't want to alarm you

1381
01:09:11,633 --> 01:09:12,967
or any of our viewers,

1382
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:14,217
but apparently,

1383
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,675
if the Tune Squad
doesn't win this game,

1384
01:09:15,758 --> 01:09:18,133
we're all gonna be
trapped here forever.

1385
01:09:18,217 --> 01:09:20,092
Luckily
the Tune Squad got

1386
01:09:20,175 --> 01:09:22,175
the four-time MVP LeBron James
on their team.

1387
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:23,383
I ain't sweating it.

1388
01:09:35,342 --> 01:09:38,383
Oh, we doomed. We're doomed!

1389
01:09:38,467 --> 01:09:41,133
You gotta be kidding me.

1390
01:09:41,217 --> 01:09:42,383
Did you see
that kid fly?

1391
01:09:42,467 --> 01:09:43,800
Uh-huh.

1392
01:09:43,883 --> 01:09:45,925
He's like Superman,
but with a hi-top fade.

1393
01:09:54,342 --> 01:09:55,675
Rel, I gotta tell you,

1394
01:09:55,758 --> 01:09:59,383
this Goon Squad is loaded,
top to bottom.

1395
01:09:59,467 --> 01:10:01,842
Bugs Bunny is gonna need
a rabbit's foot

1396
01:10:01,925 --> 01:10:03,967
against this guy, Wet Fire.

1397
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:06,675
Oh! Because he's wet,
and he's fire.

1398
01:10:06,758 --> 01:10:09,092
That's kinda brilliant.

1399
01:10:09,175 --> 01:10:11,383
- Whoop. Oh. Whoop. Ha-ha.
- What?

1400
01:10:12,717 --> 01:10:15,342
- Gimme that ball!
- Back off, rabbit.

1401
01:10:15,425 --> 01:10:17,550
Entering
the Splash Zone! Ha-ha!

1402
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:22,842
And you know
what else is brilliant?

1403
01:10:22,925 --> 01:10:24,967
This ball movement, man.
Check it out.

1404
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:26,508
Sufferin' succotash!

1405
01:10:26,592 --> 01:10:27,633
Leading!

1406
01:10:27,717 --> 01:10:28,883
Whoo!

1407
01:10:31,675 --> 01:10:34,425
Sixteen? What's up
with the score?

1408
01:10:34,508 --> 01:10:36,258
Style points, Dad.

1409
01:10:36,342 --> 01:10:37,383
Style points?

1410
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:39,050
Style points?

1411
01:10:39,133 --> 01:10:40,425
We playing video game rules.

1412
01:10:40,508 --> 01:10:42,758
Style points, power-ups.

1413
01:10:42,842 --> 01:10:45,550
See, kids, playing video games
do pay off!

1414
01:10:47,342 --> 01:10:49,133
Come on, baby bunny.

1415
01:10:49,217 --> 01:10:50,592
Out of my way, you big worm.

1416
01:10:54,008 --> 01:10:54,967
Thank you.

1417
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:58,092
Help me. Please.

1418
01:10:58,175 --> 01:10:59,258
What?

1419
01:11:00,258 --> 01:11:01,550
Come chase this down.

1420
01:11:03,717 --> 01:11:05,342
Hey!

1421
01:11:05,425 --> 01:11:07,467
Arachnneka
throws down a monster dunk.

1422
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:09,467
And she dunks again.
And again and again.

1423
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:10,967
Eat that, eat that,
eat that, eat that.

1424
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:12,842
And again and again and again!
And again!

1425
01:11:12,925 --> 01:11:15,008
And again!

1426
01:11:16,592 --> 01:11:17,883
Ow.

1427
01:11:19,883 --> 01:11:21,217
Down goes the king!

1428
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,800
Is... Is this legal?

1429
01:11:22,883 --> 01:11:24,967
Man, she got six arms.
What else she supposed to do?

1430
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:25,967
Oh, boy.

1431
01:11:27,258 --> 01:11:29,675
Get up, LeBron.
We need you.

1432
01:11:29,758 --> 01:11:31,383
How'd that taste, King?

1433
01:11:33,467 --> 01:11:34,883
Yeah! Can't touch us.

1434
01:11:34,967 --> 01:11:36,675
Listen, Bron-Bron.

1435
01:11:36,758 --> 01:11:39,258
This is basketball,
but with a spin to it.

1436
01:11:39,342 --> 01:11:41,217
We gotta think outta the box.

1437
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:42,508
There's only one basketball.

1438
01:11:42,592 --> 01:11:44,675
And, Bugs,
don't do nothing looney.

1439
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:46,008
Nothing looney?

1440
01:11:46,092 --> 01:11:47,175
Let's go!

1441
01:11:47,258 --> 01:11:49,717
We're not called
the "Fundamental Tunes."

1442
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,300
Don't just stand there,
rabbit!

1443
01:11:51,383 --> 01:11:53,217
Get the ball to LeBron!

1444
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:56,175
LeBron's so hard
to guard down low

1445
01:11:56,258 --> 01:11:58,425
using that huge size
advantage.

1446
01:11:58,508 --> 01:12:00,633
Sorry, son. You know
I gotta go win this game.

1447
01:12:00,717 --> 01:12:01,758
If you say so.

1448
01:12:04,217 --> 01:12:06,342
Ooh,
he just got blocked by Dom.

1449
01:12:06,425 --> 01:12:08,383
The King has been dethroned.

1450
01:12:08,467 --> 01:12:09,717
His own son.

1451
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,175
That is cold-blooded, Ernie.

1452
01:12:11,258 --> 01:12:12,675
Look, this is not like
any kind of basketball

1453
01:12:12,758 --> 01:12:13,758
LeBron has ever seen.

1454
01:12:13,842 --> 01:12:15,592
Whoo!

1455
01:12:15,675 --> 01:12:18,008
I've never seen
anything like this.

1456
01:12:18,092 --> 01:12:19,258
Where's that pass going?

1457
01:12:19,342 --> 01:12:20,758
- Hey, what up, Bugs?
- Watch the hair.

1458
01:12:23,258 --> 01:12:24,758
Thank you. Assist.

1459
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,133
Top floor!

1460
01:12:33,342 --> 01:12:35,383
33-pointer?

1461
01:12:35,467 --> 01:12:36,925
- Oh, yes!
- Huh?

1462
01:12:37,008 --> 01:12:39,217
Well played.
See, this is why we practice.

1463
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,217
We didn't. We don't practice.

1464
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:42,425
What's up with that, Pete?

1465
01:12:44,133 --> 01:12:45,883
You can't move the basket like
that, man, that's cheating.

1466
01:12:45,967 --> 01:12:47,550
No, you can.
You can move the basket.

1467
01:12:47,633 --> 01:12:48,883
Man, you don't
even know what you're talk...

1468
01:12:48,967 --> 01:12:50,133
A technical?

1469
01:12:50,217 --> 01:12:51,633
Oh, you're gonna give me
a technical?

1470
01:12:51,717 --> 01:12:53,133
Man, I wish you would. Tsk!

1471
01:12:53,217 --> 01:12:55,717
I say, what kind of ship
are you running here?

1472
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,258
You gotta call the game fair.

1473
01:12:57,342 --> 01:12:59,425
I say, fair!

1474
01:13:01,675 --> 01:13:03,300
Well, that happened.

1475
01:13:03,383 --> 01:13:04,592
Never in my career

1476
01:13:04,675 --> 01:13:06,592
did I think
I'd say these five words,

1477
01:13:06,675 --> 01:13:09,175
"Foghorn Leghorn
just got ejected."

1478
01:13:09,258 --> 01:13:11,717
This is not going well.

1479
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,092
Your dad's got this. I hope.

1480
01:13:19,133 --> 01:13:21,383
Let's go. Stand her up.
D up! Right there.

1481
01:13:21,467 --> 01:13:23,258
Come here, bunny.

1482
01:13:23,342 --> 01:13:25,800
- Got you!
- Iverson'd! Ha-ha!

1483
01:13:30,175 --> 01:13:32,175
- Way to go!
- We love LeBron!

1484
01:13:32,258 --> 01:13:34,092
Let's go!

1485
01:13:34,175 --> 01:13:35,258
You act like
it's the first time

1486
01:13:35,342 --> 01:13:37,092
you ever dunked.

1487
01:13:44,133 --> 01:13:45,133
Buckets.

1488
01:13:52,592 --> 01:13:53,633
Buckets.

1489
01:13:58,008 --> 01:13:59,800
Who you calling "worm"?

1490
01:13:59,883 --> 01:14:02,050
Not you, girl.

1491
01:14:04,883 --> 01:14:06,967
Ooh! I got her, I got her!

1492
01:14:09,508 --> 01:14:11,633
Oh, she got me.

1493
01:14:11,717 --> 01:14:13,967
We're gettin' murderized!

1494
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:15,300
Try a power-up, Dad!

1495
01:14:15,383 --> 01:14:16,592
What you got, King?

1496
01:14:16,675 --> 01:14:18,425
Gimme that, gimme that,
gimme that!

1497
01:14:18,508 --> 01:14:20,133
- Oh, I got this.
- Wait!

1498
01:14:20,217 --> 01:14:23,217
LeBron's on a mission.
He wants to go coast to coast!

1499
01:14:25,675 --> 01:14:27,383
And...

1500
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:28,592
then some.

1501
01:14:31,092 --> 01:14:32,175
Ouch.

1502
01:14:32,258 --> 01:14:33,508
Ooh.

1503
01:14:33,592 --> 01:14:35,217
Yikes.

1504
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,508
LeBron just hit a force field.

1505
01:14:39,592 --> 01:14:41,175
Man,
and speaking from experience,

1506
01:14:41,258 --> 01:14:42,508
that's gonna leave a mark.

1507
01:14:44,008 --> 01:14:45,383
We gotta stop meeting
this way.

1508
01:14:45,467 --> 01:14:46,633
Tell me about it.

1509
01:14:46,717 --> 01:14:48,217
Time out.

1510
01:14:50,425 --> 01:14:51,675
I'm not a betting duck,

1511
01:14:51,758 --> 01:14:54,092
but, uh, my money's
on the other team.

1512
01:14:54,175 --> 01:14:55,675
Let's run a triangle offense.

1513
01:14:55,758 --> 01:14:57,342
- We're getting crushed.
- A square offense.

1514
01:14:57,425 --> 01:14:59,133
A trapezoid offense?
Any shape!

1515
01:14:59,217 --> 01:15:00,508
I know.

1516
01:15:00,592 --> 01:15:02,258
Look at 'em.
Their spirit is broken,

1517
01:15:02,342 --> 01:15:04,675
and that's exactly
what we want.

1518
01:15:04,758 --> 01:15:07,342
But I guess it's time to
put 'em out of their misery.

1519
01:15:07,425 --> 01:15:08,758
Go ahead and take
a little break, Dom Dom,

1520
01:15:08,842 --> 01:15:11,050
because do you know
what time it is?

1521
01:15:11,133 --> 01:15:12,467
What time is it, Al?

1522
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:14,717
Oh, it's Dame Time.

1523
01:15:16,092 --> 01:15:18,258
<i>New character unlocked.</i>

1524
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:20,550
New character?

1525
01:15:20,633 --> 01:15:21,842
Here's our first

1526
01:15:21,925 --> 01:15:23,842
Goon Squad substitution
of the night.

1527
01:15:23,925 --> 01:15:26,717
<i>Chronos!</i>

1528
01:15:30,383 --> 01:15:32,883
It's the King Stomper!

1529
01:15:34,675 --> 01:15:36,550
- Granny, I'm subbing you out.
- What?

1530
01:15:36,633 --> 01:15:38,925
- Road Runner, you're in.
- Beep, beep.

1531
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,383
Knock yourself out, kid.

1532
01:15:46,467 --> 01:15:50,175
Chronos!
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

1533
01:15:50,675 --> 01:15:51,675
Chronos!

1534
01:16:02,675 --> 01:16:04,217
Beep, beep.

1535
01:16:17,508 --> 01:16:20,842
Beep, beep.

1536
01:16:26,383 --> 01:16:27,342
Sheesh!

1537
01:16:27,425 --> 01:16:28,883
Dude could use a makeover.

1538
01:16:28,967 --> 01:16:30,383
Mmm. Oh.

1539
01:16:30,467 --> 01:16:32,008
Wow. Whoo!

1540
01:16:32,092 --> 01:16:33,675
Hmm. Oh. Okay.

1541
01:16:33,758 --> 01:16:35,342
Ha-ha! Word.

1542
01:16:37,883 --> 01:16:40,008
Oh...

1543
01:16:52,217 --> 01:16:54,675
Yeah!

1544
01:16:57,550 --> 01:17:00,092
- Dame Time!
- Bye, bye!

1545
01:17:00,175 --> 01:17:02,925
Ooh, I'm feeling salty now.

1546
01:17:08,133 --> 01:17:10,342
Way to Dominate!

1547
01:17:11,675 --> 01:17:12,842
That's how you do it, Dom!

1548
01:17:12,925 --> 01:17:14,133
Goon Squad, what?

1549
01:17:14,217 --> 01:17:16,717
Yeah, Dom!
Puttin' the lights out!

1550
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:17,717
Yeah, Dom!

1551
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,508
- Hey, Tune lover.
- Wow.

1552
01:17:19,592 --> 01:17:21,050
- You feel good?
- Feel great.

1553
01:17:21,133 --> 01:17:24,258
What a job. What a job!
Amazing. He's amazing.

1554
01:17:24,342 --> 01:17:25,508
Goon Squad, what you got?

1555
01:17:25,592 --> 01:17:26,508
They can't touch us.

1556
01:17:27,675 --> 01:17:29,175
Goon Squad!

1557
01:17:29,258 --> 01:17:30,425
We got this.

1558
01:17:30,508 --> 01:17:31,717
You're the best, Dom.
You're the best!

1559
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,092
Come on, give it up!
Give it up!

1560
01:17:33,175 --> 01:17:34,217
Thanks for the turnovers.

1561
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:36,508
Goon Squad!

1562
01:17:37,467 --> 01:17:40,300
Goon Squad!

1563
01:17:57,633 --> 01:17:59,217
Oh, please don't let us
get deleted.

1564
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,383
Please don't let us
get deleted.

1565
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:02,258
Come on, guys.
Don't give up.

1566
01:18:02,342 --> 01:18:03,675
There's a whole other half
to play.

1567
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:06,925
I'm telling you,
we can still win this.

1568
01:18:07,008 --> 01:18:10,800
How? We're getting decimated.

1569
01:18:12,717 --> 01:18:14,925
We need a boost. A pick-me-up.

1570
01:18:15,633 --> 01:18:17,050
A secret weapon.

1571
01:18:17,133 --> 01:18:19,383
We need a miracle.

1572
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,842
I don't know
if this counts as a miracle,

1573
01:18:22,925 --> 01:18:25,550
but I found Michael Jordan!

1574
01:18:25,633 --> 01:18:28,883
He was in the audience.
I know he can help.

1575
01:18:31,717 --> 01:18:33,383
His Airness?

1576
01:18:33,467 --> 01:18:35,092
You found him?

1577
01:18:35,175 --> 01:18:37,425
I can feel his power already.

1578
01:18:37,508 --> 01:18:40,217
Ooh, I can hear his shoes.

1579
01:18:44,883 --> 01:18:49,467
<i>At guard, 6'6",</i>
<i>from North Carolina...</i>

1580
01:18:51,925 --> 01:18:53,592
<i>Number 23,</i>

1581
01:18:53,675 --> 01:18:56,633
<i>Michael Jordan...</i>

1582
01:18:56,717 --> 01:18:58,092
<i>Huh?</i>

1583
01:19:01,967 --> 01:19:04,425
Come on, man.
That's Michael B. Jordan.

1584
01:19:04,508 --> 01:19:05,592
The actor.

1585
01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:08,425
I was just getting
some popcorn,

1586
01:19:08,508 --> 01:19:10,342
and then this cat grabbed me.

1587
01:19:10,425 --> 01:19:12,425
We couldn't get
Michael A. Jordan,

1588
01:19:12,508 --> 01:19:14,258
so we got Michael B. Jordan?

1589
01:19:14,342 --> 01:19:16,633
How could you think
he was His Airness?

1590
01:19:16,717 --> 01:19:18,133
They look nothing alike.

1591
01:19:18,217 --> 01:19:22,133
It's been 25 years.
I thought he aged gracefully.

1592
01:19:22,217 --> 01:19:24,133
This is awkward, um,

1593
01:19:24,217 --> 01:19:26,258
but I believe in you guys,
okay?

1594
01:19:26,342 --> 01:19:28,967
Clear eyes, full hearts,
can't lose. You hear me?

1595
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:30,300
Clear eyes, full hearts,
can't lose!

1596
01:19:30,383 --> 01:19:31,592
- Say it with me...
- Mike.

1597
01:19:33,175 --> 01:19:34,467
Yeah, y'all got this.

1598
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:36,133
I'm... I'm too much.
You're right. I'm sorry.

1599
01:19:36,217 --> 01:19:38,258
I'mma go back to my seat.
You came back three-one.

1600
01:19:38,342 --> 01:19:39,425
- Well...
- You killed it.

1601
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:41,175
You can do it again!

1602
01:19:41,258 --> 01:19:42,133
Right.

1603
01:19:42,217 --> 01:19:44,133
Well, that was a bust.

1604
01:19:44,217 --> 01:19:46,800
Anyone else
got any bright ideas?

1605
01:19:46,883 --> 01:19:48,800
Come on!
Get it together, guys.

1606
01:19:48,883 --> 01:19:51,800
The Tune Squad
doesn't give up at halftime.

1607
01:19:51,883 --> 01:19:54,050
The Tune Squad
doesn't give up ever.

1608
01:19:54,133 --> 01:19:55,300
We're down a thousand points.

1609
01:19:55,383 --> 01:19:56,925
No team is coming back
from this.

1610
01:19:57,008 --> 01:19:59,717
Well, why don't you try
coaching us better, bucko!

1611
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,592
I've been coaching y'all
this whole time!

1612
01:20:01,675 --> 01:20:03,883
Sylvester over here
getting the wrong MJ,

1613
01:20:03,967 --> 01:20:06,383
Granny's out here
having a martini at halftime,

1614
01:20:06,467 --> 01:20:08,717
and Taz might as well
be playing for the other team!

1615
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,008
Your son
plays for the other team.

1616
01:20:11,092 --> 01:20:13,008
Yeah, you're a bad dad.

1617
01:20:13,092 --> 01:20:14,133
I'm a bad dad?

1618
01:20:14,217 --> 01:20:15,592
I've been trying
to save my son

1619
01:20:15,675 --> 01:20:17,092
and coach y'all
at the same time.

1620
01:20:17,175 --> 01:20:19,342
- What y'all doing?
- We've been trying.

1621
01:20:19,425 --> 01:20:20,925
Trying to do what?

1622
01:20:21,008 --> 01:20:23,633
Trying to be like you.

1623
01:20:26,092 --> 01:20:28,675
And it's not working.

1624
01:20:34,425 --> 01:20:36,633
Because you're not me.

1625
01:20:42,967 --> 01:20:46,008
"You never let me just...
do me."

1626
01:20:48,133 --> 01:20:49,967
Huh?

1627
01:20:50,050 --> 01:20:52,883
Okay, I got it. New game plan.

1628
01:20:54,633 --> 01:20:55,675
Bugs.

1629
01:21:01,717 --> 01:21:03,842
Time to do
what you guys do best.

1630
01:21:16,467 --> 01:21:17,758
You know something?

1631
01:21:17,842 --> 01:21:21,217
If we're going out,
we're going out looney.

1632
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:22,467
Let's go, team!

1633
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:25,633
All tooney, big mooney,
full looney!

1634
01:21:25,717 --> 01:21:27,342
Good plan.
I say, good plan.

1635
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:33,383
It seems bleak,
but let's remember,

1636
01:21:33,467 --> 01:21:35,300
there's an entire half
left to play.

1637
01:21:43,425 --> 01:21:47,550
Oh, that first half
was interminable.

1638
01:21:47,633 --> 01:21:50,050
Are you kidding me?

1639
01:21:57,217 --> 01:21:59,967
It's showtime!

1640
01:22:03,592 --> 01:22:05,717
Yeah! Let's go, Tunes!

1641
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,467
Yep, we in here.
Are we ready?

1642
01:22:08,633 --> 01:22:10,633
Tune Squad,
we in the building!

1643
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:12,383
Ha-ha. Yes, sir!

1644
01:22:12,467 --> 01:22:14,467
Tune Squad!

1645
01:22:20,592 --> 01:22:23,092
Hey, they may be down
a gazillion points,

1646
01:22:23,175 --> 01:22:25,967
but LeBron James and the Tunes
are coming back out here

1647
01:22:26,050 --> 01:22:27,967
for the third quarter
with some renewed energy.

1648
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:31,300
And I don't understand why.
They are losing really badly.

1649
01:22:32,883 --> 01:22:34,050
All right, here we go
in the third quarter.

1650
01:22:36,217 --> 01:22:37,133
Uh-oh.

1651
01:22:37,217 --> 01:22:40,675
Yeah! Bird versus baby bird.

1652
01:22:40,758 --> 01:22:42,008
Do you have your ticket?

1653
01:22:42,092 --> 01:22:45,633
'Cause the 11:50 Express
is running on time.

1654
01:22:45,717 --> 01:22:47,050
Hmm? Huh?

1655
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:54,092
Classic.

1656
01:22:55,633 --> 01:22:57,092
Give me that ball, rabbit.

1657
01:22:57,883 --> 01:22:59,092
Whoa!

1658
01:23:00,758 --> 01:23:03,800
Someone's absorbed
in the game.

1659
01:23:06,467 --> 01:23:08,342
Beep, beep.

1660
01:23:08,425 --> 01:23:09,842
- Yo.
- Hey, guys.

1661
01:23:09,925 --> 01:23:11,217
Where's the ball?

1662
01:23:12,258 --> 01:23:14,300
Beep, beep.

1663
01:23:20,967 --> 01:23:22,258
Beep, beep.

1664
01:23:23,467 --> 01:23:25,342
Oh, no! Are you kidding me?

1665
01:23:25,425 --> 01:23:26,800
Road Runner smokescreen?

1666
01:23:26,883 --> 01:23:28,758
It's the oldest trick
in the book!

1667
01:23:28,842 --> 01:23:29,842
Tweety!

1668
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:32,758
Ooh, slam dunk!

1669
01:23:32,842 --> 01:23:35,050
Just like I drew it up.

1670
01:23:35,133 --> 01:23:37,717
Gossamer, I say,
he's the quicker-picker-upper.

1671
01:23:40,342 --> 01:23:43,217
Oh, what
a no-look pass ahead to Dom.

1672
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:45,383
Looks like the Goons
are playing keep-away.

1673
01:23:46,758 --> 01:23:48,217
<i>Dom passes to Wet Fire.</i>

1674
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:50,550
<i>Wet Fire back to Brow.
He's gonna dunk... Oh!</i>

1675
01:23:50,633 --> 01:23:51,967
<i>But he freezes at the rim!</i>

1676
01:23:53,133 --> 01:23:54,300
Oh? Huh?

1677
01:23:55,883 --> 01:23:57,425
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1678
01:23:57,508 --> 01:23:59,592
<i>Giving new meaning to
"suspended from the game"!</i>

1679
01:23:59,675 --> 01:24:01,258
Give me that.

1680
01:24:01,342 --> 01:24:03,717
<i>But the Goons fast break,
take it to the other end.</i>

1681
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:07,717
<i>These silly Tunes don't have
what it takes to win.</i>

1682
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,758
<i>No, wait, wait.
I wasn't trying to start a...</i>

1683
01:24:09,842 --> 01:24:12,675
Oh, we rappin' now?
We rappin'?

1684
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:18,092
Hey, Porky, fry 'em.

1685
01:24:18,175 --> 01:24:20,592
Fry 'em? Me... Me... Me?

1686
01:24:20,675 --> 01:24:22,342
Show 'em who you really are,

1687

Style points.

1710
01:25:27,508 --> 01:25:30,092
I'm not exactly sure
what we just witnessed here.

1711
01:25:30,175 --> 01:25:33,008
He just got
bonus points for those bars.

1712
01:25:33,092 --> 01:25:34,342
He was spittin' hot fire.

1713
01:25:34,425 --> 01:25:35,383
Yeah!

1714
01:25:36,925 --> 01:25:40,008
Taz brings it up.
He can really pat the rock.

1715
01:25:40,092 --> 01:25:41,717
And it's stolen by The Brow!

1716
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,508
Back to Tasmania,
ya little devil.

1717
01:25:43,592 --> 01:25:46,425
Taz!

1718
01:25:53,883 --> 01:25:54,967
Huh?

1719
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:56,925
- Yeah!
- Let's go! Yeah!

1720
01:25:58,258 --> 01:26:00,258
- Are you serious?
- Yeah!

1721
01:26:00,342 --> 01:26:01,883
Make a call, Pete!

1722
01:26:01,967 --> 01:26:03,550
Oh, you wanna swallow
your whistle?

1723
01:26:06,175 --> 01:26:07,342
Yeah! How'd that taste?

1724
01:26:07,425 --> 01:26:08,633
Now call the game!

1725
01:26:11,258 --> 01:26:12,967
How did I lose control?

1726
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:15,050
I didn't lose control.

1727
01:26:15,133 --> 01:26:17,383
You lost... You...

1728
01:26:17,467 --> 01:26:19,633
This one lost...
I haven't lost any...

1729
01:26:19,717 --> 01:26:21,800
Yeah, baby, let's go.
Let's go!

1730
01:26:21,883 --> 01:26:23,092
- Yes!
- Yay, LeBron!

1731
01:26:23,175 --> 01:26:24,425
- Let's go!
- Yes!

1732
01:26:24,508 --> 01:26:25,800
- Let's go, Tunes!
- Here we go! Let's go!

1733
01:26:25,883 --> 01:26:27,425
Let's go, Tunes!

1734
01:26:27,508 --> 01:26:29,300
Let's go, Tunes!

1735
01:26:29,383 --> 01:26:30,717
Let's go, Tunes!

1736
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,967
Let's go, Tunes!
Let's go, Tunes!

1737
01:26:34,050 --> 01:26:35,508
Let's go, Tunes!

1738
01:26:35,592 --> 01:26:37,883
Let's go, Tunes!
Let's go, Tunes!

1739
01:26:37,967 --> 01:26:40,717
Wow!
Check out this crowd.

1740
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,800
Everyone really getting behind
the Tune Squad.

1741
01:26:43,883 --> 01:26:45,717
You know somethin',
it's about time.

1742
01:26:53,842 --> 01:26:55,592
Coming off
the bench now for the Tunes,

1743
01:26:55,675 --> 01:26:57,550
Wile E. Coyote.

1744
01:27:03,342 --> 01:27:04,425
Beep, beep.

1745
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,133
Wow.

1746
01:27:25,175 --> 01:27:26,300
Look out.

1747
01:27:26,383 --> 01:27:27,800
Looks like Wile E.'s
gotten himself

1748
01:27:27,883 --> 01:27:29,467
mixed up in the machine.

1749
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:45,883
And just like that,

1750
01:27:45,967 --> 01:27:48,467
the Tunes have a thousand
points on the board.

1751
01:27:48,550 --> 01:27:50,008
We havin' fun yet?

1752
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,967
They're gonna clean
these coyotes off the court

1753
01:27:54,050 --> 01:27:55,467
and keep the game going.

1754
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:57,467
What's wrong, Al?
That was awesome.

1755
01:27:57,550 --> 01:27:58,633
What do you mean,
"What's wrong?"

1756
01:27:58,717 --> 01:28:00,133
They're catching up.

1757
01:28:00,217 --> 01:28:01,967
Run Dame Time.

1758
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:07,342
Not him again.

1759
01:28:07,425 --> 01:28:09,383
He's gonna
make bacon out of us.

1760
01:28:09,467 --> 01:28:13,050
Oh, don't worry.
Time's on our side.

1761
01:28:16,842 --> 01:28:21,467
She knows time is literally
on their side, right?

1762
01:28:24,758 --> 01:28:26,008
You sure about this, Granny?

1763
01:28:26,092 --> 01:28:29,008
I'm going old-school
on his butt.

1764
01:28:34,925 --> 01:28:36,175
Whoa.

1765
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:45,300
Come on.

1766
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:49,300
Stop!

1767
01:28:54,842 --> 01:28:56,842
Tick-tock.

1768
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,925
Hyah!

1769
01:29:03,925 --> 01:29:07,175
She is The One.

1770
01:29:09,717 --> 01:29:12,633
What in the AARP
is going on out here?

1771
01:29:15,175 --> 01:29:16,925
I got hops! Whoo!

1772
01:29:18,425 --> 01:29:19,883
Lola!

1773
01:29:19,967 --> 01:29:21,092
Got you, Bron!

1774
01:29:44,925 --> 01:29:46,800
There we go! Let's go!

1775
01:29:46,883 --> 01:29:49,050
And the Tunes
take the lead!

1776
01:29:49,133 --> 01:29:52,175
What a play from Lola
and LeBron James!

1777
01:29:52,258 --> 01:29:53,967
A monster jam!

1778
01:29:54,050 --> 01:29:56,300
LeBron came back
from three-one down.

1779
01:29:56,383 --> 01:29:58,883
Can he come back
from this far back?

1780
01:29:58,967 --> 01:30:00,300
Let me tell you this,
I woke up today

1781
01:30:00,383 --> 01:30:01,800
and only knew one world.

1782
01:30:01,883 --> 01:30:04,425
Then I got sucked into
my phone, and at this point,

1783
01:30:04,508 --> 01:30:06,758
anything's possible!

1784
01:30:08,842 --> 01:30:10,092
- Way to go, Tunes!
- Let's go!

1785
01:30:10,175 --> 01:30:11,092
Foghorn, right here.

1786
01:30:11,175 --> 01:30:12,425
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1787
01:30:12,508 --> 01:30:13,633
- I say, that's all right!
- Lola!

1788
01:30:13,717 --> 01:30:14,800
Yes! My dude!

1789
01:30:14,883 --> 01:30:15,842
Taz!

1790
01:30:17,758 --> 01:30:20,092
- Go, baby! Yeah!
- Oh, yeah! Here we go!

1791
01:30:20,175 --> 01:30:21,592
Way to go,
Tune Squad!

1792
01:30:21,675 --> 01:30:22,758
Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!

1793
01:30:22,842 --> 01:30:25,800
Now we having some fun! Yeah!

1794
01:30:25,883 --> 01:30:28,258
Whoo-hoo! This is
fun basketball right here!

1795
01:30:28,342 --> 01:30:30,883
- Be yourselves! Be yourselves!
- All right!

1796
01:30:30,967 --> 01:30:33,425
Hey, Dom, are you a Tune
or are you a Goon?

1797
01:30:33,508 --> 01:30:34,717
Tune or Goon? Tune or Goon?

1798
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,467
Make up your mind.
Make up your mind.

1799
01:30:36,550 --> 01:30:38,383
Let's go. Sit down.

1800
01:30:38,467 --> 01:30:40,467
Yeah. Way to get looney
out there.

1801
01:30:40,550 --> 01:30:42,467
Ooh-whee!

1802
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:44,342
We did it!

1803
01:30:47,467 --> 01:30:48,967
Everybody happy, huh?

1804
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:50,758
Everybody having
a good time? Yeah?

1805
01:30:50,842 --> 01:30:52,133
You having a lot of fun
out there?

1806
01:30:52,217 --> 01:30:53,467
'Cause that's all
that matters, right?

1807
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:54,717
Is that you're having fun.

1808
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,133
That doesn't matter at all!

1809
01:30:56,217 --> 01:30:59,008
What matters is that
I win this game!

1810
01:31:00,133 --> 01:31:01,217
Oh, and you, Dom.

1811
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:03,633
How are you losing
at your own game?

1812
01:31:03,717 --> 01:31:05,092
For server's sake,

1813
01:31:05,175 --> 01:31:06,592
I didn't even think
that was possible!

1814
01:31:06,675 --> 01:31:08,675
I expected a lot more
out of you, son.

1815
01:31:08,758 --> 01:31:11,717
Get your head in the game.
I need to win!

1816
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:12,925
All right!

1817
01:31:13,008 --> 01:31:14,675
Whoo-hoo! Yee-haw!

1818
01:31:14,758 --> 01:31:15,925
Drinks on me!

1819
01:31:16,008 --> 01:31:17,633
Boy, that was awesome!

1820
01:31:17,717 --> 01:31:18,717
Go team!

1821
01:31:20,425 --> 01:31:23,592
Yeah, maybe
your dad was right about you.

1822
01:31:23,675 --> 01:31:26,508
Letting you be you
was a mistake.

1823
01:31:30,758 --> 01:31:32,175
Okay.

1824
01:31:32,258 --> 01:31:33,883
If everybody would move down,

1825
01:31:33,967 --> 01:31:35,633
then we could all sit
on the bench.

1826
01:31:35,717 --> 01:31:38,175
Let's all sit on the bench!

1827
01:31:38,258 --> 01:31:40,217
Now that's what
I call momentum, son.

1828
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:41,633
- LeBron?
- Way to go!

1829
01:31:41,717 --> 01:31:42,925
Hey, you with us?

1830
01:31:43,008 --> 01:31:44,550
I'm so tickled.

1831
01:31:46,717 --> 01:31:48,758
Let's end this.

1832
01:31:48,842 --> 01:31:50,675
I'm getting my son back.

1833
01:32:06,217 --> 01:32:08,050
Iso. Clear out.

1834
01:32:16,383 --> 01:32:17,967
I wonder what move
he's gonna do.

1835
01:32:18,050 --> 01:32:19,050
The post-up?

1836
01:32:19,133 --> 01:32:20,050
Maybe the fadeaway.

1837
01:32:20,133 --> 01:32:22,425
He's gonna dunk all over him.

1838
01:32:22,508 --> 01:32:24,800
Look at that kid!
Kid's too small.

1839
01:32:31,842 --> 01:32:33,258
Dad, what are you doing?

1840
01:32:33,342 --> 01:32:34,592
We're in the middle of a game.

1841
01:32:35,675 --> 01:32:37,342
Hey, what's goin' on?

1842
01:32:37,425 --> 01:32:38,717
I don't know.

1843
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:41,800
Dad...

1844
01:32:44,467 --> 01:32:49,133
Dom, your game
is amazing, son.

1845
01:32:49,217 --> 01:32:50,300
But I guess
I would've known that

1846
01:32:50,383 --> 01:32:51,842
if I would've listened more.

1847
01:32:51,925 --> 01:32:53,925
Sorry I didn't.

1848
01:32:54,008 --> 01:32:56,008
For me, when I was a kid,

1849
01:32:56,092 --> 01:32:58,758
the things that I went through
to get where I am now,

1850
01:32:58,842 --> 01:33:01,342
I had to be a certain way.

1851
01:33:02,342 --> 01:33:04,050
Yeah, it helped me win games,

1852
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:07,425
but not so much being a dad.

1853
01:33:10,217 --> 01:33:13,550
I'm still learning how.
You're teaching me.

1854
01:33:14,842 --> 01:33:16,467
I want you to be yourself.

1855
01:33:19,258 --> 01:33:21,342
Do you understand
how much I love you?

1856
01:33:22,883 --> 01:33:25,717
Do you understand
how important you are to me?

1857
01:33:27,842 --> 01:33:29,425
How very special you are?

1858
01:33:30,925 --> 01:33:34,425
I mean, I don't even know
if I'm saying this right.

1859
01:33:41,883 --> 01:33:43,800
Sounds right to me.

1860
01:33:50,967 --> 01:33:52,425
I love you, Dad.

1861
01:33:53,592 --> 01:33:55,175
I love you too, son.

1862
01:34:02,925 --> 01:34:06,175
- Oh, now, that's beautiful.
- Let's go!

1863
01:34:06,258 --> 01:34:07,300
Whoo!

1864
01:34:07,383 --> 01:34:09,300
I think I'm gonna cry.

1865
01:34:09,383 --> 01:34:10,800
Not me.

1866
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:15,258
Bugs, pull it together.

1867
01:34:15,342 --> 01:34:16,383
Dom!

1868
01:34:17,967 --> 01:34:18,967
Dom!

1869
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:23,717
Mom!

1870
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,592
Hey, Xosha!

1871
01:34:25,675 --> 01:34:27,050
Are you serious?

1872
01:34:29,592 --> 01:34:30,800
Zip it!

1873
01:34:32,675 --> 01:34:34,425
You two are a joke,
you know that?

1874
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:37,175
I got this, Dad.

1875
01:34:37,258 --> 01:34:38,800
Oh, what?
You got something to say?

1876
01:34:38,883 --> 01:34:40,300
Yeah.

1877
01:34:40,383 --> 01:34:42,425
I think you want people to
fear you more than anything.

1878
01:34:42,508 --> 01:34:44,717
And I'm not about that, Al G.

1879
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,383
I'm playing with my dad.

1880
01:34:46,467 --> 01:34:49,133
First of all, it's Mr. Rhythm
to you, you little traitor.

1881
01:34:49,217 --> 01:34:50,675
Second of all, you're not.

1882
01:34:50,758 --> 01:34:51,967
You're playing
against your dad.

1883
01:34:52,050 --> 01:34:53,800
See what this says?
"Goon Squad."

1884
01:34:53,883 --> 01:34:55,633
You already
made your choice, Dom.

1885
01:34:55,717 --> 01:34:56,925
Right, Pete? He can't...

1886
01:34:57,008 --> 01:34:59,508
Pete, are you crying?

1887
01:34:59,592 --> 01:35:01,800
There's no crying
in the Serververse, Pete!

1888
01:35:03,842 --> 01:35:05,800
All right. Yeah, all right.

1889
01:35:05,883 --> 01:35:07,300
I see how it is, Dom.

1890
01:35:07,383 --> 01:35:09,008
I see how it is.

1891
01:35:09,092 --> 01:35:10,925
I gave you everything!

1892
01:35:11,008 --> 01:35:12,883
I say, I say,
good to have you, son.

1893
01:35:12,967 --> 01:35:13,967
Great spot for you
right here, kid.

1894
01:35:14,050 --> 01:35:15,133
We got 'em now!

1895
01:35:15,217 --> 01:35:16,258
<i>Bienvenido, senorito!</i>

1896
01:35:16,342 --> 01:35:17,300
Somebody get him a new jersey.

1897
01:35:17,383 --> 01:35:18,342
Welcome to the hunt.

1898
01:35:18,425 --> 01:35:19,758
Sufferin' succotash!

1899
01:35:19,842 --> 01:35:21,758
I made this, just in case.

1900
01:35:21,842 --> 01:35:22,800
Thanks, Granny.

1901
01:35:22,883 --> 01:35:24,300
Eh. What's up, Dom?

1902
01:35:24,383 --> 01:35:25,592
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.

1903
01:35:25,675 --> 01:35:26,925
Here you go, Dom.

1904
01:35:27,008 --> 01:35:28,592
Really glad
to have you on the team!

1905
01:35:28,675 --> 01:35:29,675
Thanks, Dad.

1906
01:35:29,758 --> 01:35:30,800
Fine.

1907
01:35:32,633 --> 01:35:35,175
You wanna join these losers?

1908
01:35:35,258 --> 01:35:37,050
You go ahead, Dom.

1909
01:35:37,133 --> 01:35:39,800
'Cause it's not your game
anymore.

1910
01:35:39,883 --> 01:35:41,592
I am the game.

1911
01:35:41,675 --> 01:35:45,425
King Kong
ain't got nothin' on me!

1912
01:36:00,925 --> 01:36:02,675
- Did you see that?
- Uh-huh.

1913
01:36:02,758 --> 01:36:04,675
The man just grew,
like, five feet.

1914
01:36:09,425 --> 01:36:10,842
Yo, King.

1915
01:36:10,925 --> 01:36:13,508
You're about to lose
your family, your friends,

1916
01:36:13,592 --> 01:36:14,967
those Tunes,

1917
01:36:15,050 --> 01:36:16,925
everything you love.

1918
01:36:17,717 --> 01:36:19,092
I don't think so.

1919
01:36:19,925 --> 01:36:21,425
Oh, it's on.

1920
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:30,300
Count it!

1921
01:36:34,050 --> 01:36:35,133
Yeah, Lola!

1922
01:36:35,217 --> 01:36:36,550
All right!

1923
01:36:36,633 --> 01:36:37,633
Nice pass, King!

1924
01:36:37,717 --> 01:36:39,425
Let's go, Tunes!

1925
01:36:39,508 --> 01:36:40,842
Let's go, Tunes!

1926
01:36:40,925 --> 01:36:42,175
Let's go, Tunes!

1927
01:36:42,258 --> 01:36:45,342
That's cute.
But I thought I told you...

1928
01:36:50,675 --> 01:36:51,675
What?

1929
01:36:52,258 --> 01:36:53,425
Ugh!

1930
01:36:53,508 --> 01:36:55,883
...it's my game now.

1931
01:36:55,967 --> 01:36:57,175
Yo, yo, switching everything.

1932
01:36:57,258 --> 01:36:58,342
Yo', stay home. Bump out.

1933
01:37:01,217 --> 01:37:02,342
Sic 'em, Goons.

1934
01:37:08,258 --> 01:37:09,633
Get back, rabbit.

1935
01:37:09,717 --> 01:37:11,092
Ow!

1936
01:37:11,175 --> 01:37:12,300
Come here!

1937
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:36,467
Incoming!

1938
01:37:39,967 --> 01:37:40,967
Whoo!

1939
01:37:41,633 --> 01:37:43,342
I'm a monster!

1940
01:37:43,425 --> 01:37:45,550
We about to break
the internet, baby!

1941
01:37:47,550 --> 01:37:48,592
It's over.

1942
01:37:49,675 --> 01:37:50,883
Time out.

1943
01:37:50,967 --> 01:37:52,633
Oh, brother.

1944
01:37:54,050 --> 01:37:55,467
Did you see that?

1945
01:37:55,550 --> 01:37:56,800
He's cheating!

1946
01:37:56,883 --> 01:37:59,383
Well, I say, I say,
that plain ol' sucks.

1947
01:37:59,467 --> 01:38:00,633
Listen, it's all right.

1948
01:38:00,717 --> 01:38:02,133
All we gotta do
is get one bucket.

1949
01:38:02,217 --> 01:38:04,758
How can we score
if he controls the game, Doc?

1950
01:38:04,842 --> 01:38:06,425
Whoa!
Where my Goons at?

1951
01:38:06,508 --> 01:38:07,758
Right here, Coach!

1952
01:38:10,925 --> 01:38:12,175
No mercy!

1953
01:38:12,258 --> 01:38:16,092
That no-good,
despicable son of a glitch!

1954
01:38:19,342 --> 01:38:20,675
Yo! That's it!

1955
01:38:20,758 --> 01:38:22,800
Your move, Dad. Remember?

1956
01:38:22,883 --> 01:38:24,092
The step-back glitch.

1957
01:38:24,175 --> 01:38:26,258
In and out, crossover,
step back, shoot.

1958
01:38:26,342 --> 01:38:27,800
That move froze my whole game.

1959
01:38:27,883 --> 01:38:29,008
And that's good because...

1960
01:38:29,092 --> 01:38:30,425
If the game crashes,

1961
01:38:30,508 --> 01:38:32,092
Al G. won't be able
to control it anymore.

1962
01:38:32,175 --> 01:38:33,550
And if he can't control it,

1963
01:38:33,633 --> 01:38:34,967
he can't stop us
from scoring.

1964
01:38:35,050 --> 01:38:36,300
Right!

1965
01:38:36,383 --> 01:38:38,467
- Oh, boy!
- Yeah! Yay!

1966
01:38:39,092 --> 01:38:40,592
Wait.

1967
01:38:40,675 --> 01:38:42,675
- That's not gonna work.
- Why not?

1968
01:38:42,758 --> 01:38:46,467
When my character did
the step-back, it got deleted.

1969
01:38:46,550 --> 01:38:49,633
So, whoever does
the glitch move...

1970
01:38:49,717 --> 01:38:51,592
Will get deleted.

1971
01:38:53,883 --> 01:38:56,883
So, I say, so I guess
we're drawing straws.

1972
01:38:56,967 --> 01:38:59,467
We are not doing that.

1973
01:38:59,550 --> 01:39:00,842
We'll think of something else.

1974
01:39:00,925 --> 01:39:03,175
What about the old alley-oop?

1975
01:39:03,258 --> 01:39:04,550
I'm gonna do the step-back.

1976
01:39:05,883 --> 01:39:08,300
What? No.
Dad, you'll be deleted.

1977
01:39:08,383 --> 01:39:09,925
I'm not
a video game character.

1978
01:39:10,008 --> 01:39:11,467
I think I'll be okay.

1979
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:12,592
Dad, you don't know that.
I've done the calculations.

1980
01:39:12,675 --> 01:39:13,800
Dom.

1981
01:39:13,883 --> 01:39:15,800
Somebody's gotta do something.

1982
01:39:15,883 --> 01:39:17,550
LeBron,
you don't have to do this.

1983
01:39:17,633 --> 01:39:18,633
No!

1984
01:39:18,717 --> 01:39:20,133
Listen, just get me the ball.

1985
01:39:21,050 --> 01:39:22,050
Hands in.

1986
01:39:26,342 --> 01:39:27,633
Tune Squad on three.

1987
01:39:27,717 --> 01:39:29,133
One, two, three...

1988
01:39:29,217 --> 01:39:30,633
Tune Squad!

1989
01:39:42,758 --> 01:39:43,883
Here we go.

1990
01:39:49,133 --> 01:39:50,717
Yeah, this is fun, huh?

1991
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:53,842
We should just do it again,
and again, and again.

1992
01:39:53,925 --> 01:39:57,717
Just over, and over, and over
for all eternity.

1993
01:40:00,550 --> 01:40:01,758
How's that sound?

1994
01:40:01,842 --> 01:40:03,883
Ten seconds
on the clock.

1995
01:40:03,967 --> 01:40:07,633
The Tunes are one style point play away from victory,

1996
01:40:08,633 --> 01:40:09,675
or defeat.

1997
01:40:22,717 --> 01:40:24,342
This is
their last chance.

1998
01:40:25,258 --> 01:40:26,508
Bugs, what are you doing?

1999
01:40:26,592 --> 01:40:28,383
And it looks like
a broken play!

2000
01:40:28,467 --> 01:40:32,550
In and out, crossover,
step back...

2001
01:40:32,633 --> 01:40:34,758
Bugs, no!

2002
01:40:34,842 --> 01:40:37,342
Shoot!

2003
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,883
Bugs' shot
is gonna be short.

2004
01:41:02,758 --> 01:41:05,508
But wait, LeBron is flying
through the air!

2005
01:41:10,467 --> 01:41:11,675
Come on, Dad.

2006
01:41:18,842 --> 01:41:19,883
Oh, no.

2007
01:41:23,508 --> 01:41:25,258
He's not gonna make it.

2008
01:41:26,175 --> 01:41:27,300
He's... He's not...

2009
01:41:27,383 --> 01:41:29,092
Gonna make it.

2010
01:41:30,217 --> 01:41:31,258
No.

2011
01:41:51,925 --> 01:41:53,550
That's cheating!

2012
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:19,425
Great. Posterized.

2013
01:42:25,217 --> 01:42:27,800
Yeah! Yes! Let's go!

2014
01:42:28,342 --> 01:42:29,633
Whoo!

2015
01:42:29,717 --> 01:42:32,008
We did it! Yeah!

2016
01:42:32,092 --> 01:42:35,550
- Posterized. Yeah!
- Beep, beep.

2017
01:42:36,883 --> 01:42:38,967
The Tunes win!
The Tunes win!

2018
01:42:39,050 --> 01:42:42,008
Unbelievable!

2019
01:42:42,092 --> 01:42:45,425
Al G. just got turned
into a literal poster.

2020
01:42:45,508 --> 01:42:48,633
This is not
how I wanted to go out!

2021
01:42:50,092 --> 01:42:51,508
- Yeah!
- I say, I say,

2022
01:42:51,592 --> 01:42:52,550
- that's all right!
- That's what I'm talkin' about!

2023
01:42:52,633 --> 01:42:54,217
No, no, no, no, no!

2024
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:55,925
Hold on. No! No!

2025
01:42:56,008 --> 01:42:57,967
<i>Adios,</i> Goons!

2026
01:42:58,050 --> 01:43:00,050
We won! Whoo-hoo! We won!

2027
01:43:00,133 --> 01:43:01,300
Give me a hug!

2028
01:43:02,925 --> 01:43:05,550
- Somebody hug me! Anybody?
- I love y'all. Yeah, Tunes!

2029
01:43:05,633 --> 01:43:07,550
- All right, Dad!
- Beep, beep.

2030
01:43:07,633 --> 01:43:08,883
Great assist, Dom!

2031
01:43:08,967 --> 01:43:11,717
Whoa!

2032
01:43:26,633 --> 01:43:29,258
Yes! I never doubted you
for a second, LeBron!

2033
01:43:29,342 --> 01:43:32,133
We are going home!
Thank you so much!

2034
01:43:32,217 --> 01:43:34,717
You are the Akron Hammer.
The chosen one!

2035
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:38,550
<i>King James, man! I love you!</i>

2036
01:43:39,383 --> 01:43:40,925
<i>We going home.</i>

2037
01:43:47,675 --> 01:43:48,842
Bugs...

2038
01:43:51,217 --> 01:43:54,092
How'd I do, Coach?

2039
01:43:58,758 --> 01:44:01,925
Bugs, that's the least looney
thing you've ever done.

2040
01:44:02,008 --> 01:44:03,425
You got that right.

2041
01:44:03,508 --> 01:44:07,508
But taking care of the people
you love is fundamental.

2042
01:44:07,592 --> 01:44:09,008
Right, Doc?

2043
01:44:12,092 --> 01:44:13,342
Thank you.

2044
01:44:16,425 --> 01:44:17,508
Goodbye, Bron.

2045
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:00,425
We did it.

2046
01:45:02,425 --> 01:45:05,092
We're all back together again.

2047
01:45:06,592 --> 01:45:07,883
Bugs.

2048
01:45:07,967 --> 01:45:10,175
That's all, folks.

2049
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:35,508
- Son?
- Dad.

2050
01:45:41,133 --> 01:45:42,675
- You're all right, right?
- I'm good.

2051
01:45:42,758 --> 01:45:43,883
- You're sure?
- I'm good.

2052
01:45:43,967 --> 01:45:45,342
All right, let's go home.

2053
01:45:47,467 --> 01:45:48,508
Come here, boy.

2054
01:45:50,675 --> 01:45:51,758
Daddy!

2055
01:45:51,842 --> 01:45:53,717
- Baby, hi. Xosha, hey!
- Daddy!

2056
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:55,550
- Baby!
- Mom!

2057
01:45:55,633 --> 01:45:56,800
- Missed y'all so much.
- Bro, that was amazing.

2058
01:45:56,883 --> 01:45:58,050
I'm so proud of you!

2059
01:45:58,133 --> 01:45:59,383
All my family.

2060
01:45:59,467 --> 01:46:00,800
My goodness.

2061
01:46:00,883 --> 01:46:02,133
- I love you, guys.
- We love you, too.

2062
01:46:02,217 --> 01:46:03,508
Come on, Malik.
Come on in, man.

2063
01:46:03,592 --> 01:46:04,925
You the Bron, man!

2064
01:46:05,008 --> 01:46:06,217
It's a family affair, man.
Come on in.

2065
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:08,133
LeBron! LeBron.

2066
01:46:08,217 --> 01:46:09,883
Hey, Malik, you good?

2067
01:46:09,967 --> 01:46:11,133
No. No, man.

2068
01:46:11,217 --> 01:46:12,717
- You cryin'?
- What?

2069
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:14,175
All right.

2070
01:46:14,258 --> 01:46:15,258
- I ain't crying, bruh.
- Okay.

2071
01:46:21,133 --> 01:46:23,092
So, Dom,
you ready for basketball camp?

2072
01:46:23,175 --> 01:46:24,883
Yeah.
I'm actually pretty excited.

2073
01:46:24,967 --> 01:46:26,675
Yeah? Because I know
how much you really wanted...

2074
01:46:26,758 --> 01:46:28,258
I think
I'mma just take a break

2075
01:46:28,342 --> 01:46:30,008
from video games for now.

2076
01:46:30,092 --> 01:46:31,800
You know, after we...

2077
01:46:31,883 --> 01:46:33,425
Got sucked into one?

2078
01:46:33,508 --> 01:46:34,508
Yeah.

2079
01:46:34,592 --> 01:46:37,425
Really? Because, like...

2080
01:46:37,508 --> 01:46:39,717
I mean, I feel like
I've made a mistake.

2081
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:42,758
I mean, we can turn around
right now if you want to.

2082
01:46:42,842 --> 01:46:44,467
What are you talking about?

2083
01:46:46,758 --> 01:46:47,842
Look.

2084
01:46:56,675 --> 01:46:59,842
I mean, I figured it's
about time for you to do you.

2085
01:47:02,050 --> 01:47:03,092
Thank you, Dad.

2086
01:47:03,175 --> 01:47:04,550
You're welcome.

2087
01:47:04,633 --> 01:47:06,467
Hey, man, have fun.

2088
01:47:08,883 --> 01:47:09,883
Yo, Dom.

2089
01:47:10,675 --> 01:47:11,842
Ball?

2090
01:47:17,342 --> 01:47:18,967
I think I'mma hold onto it.

2091
01:47:29,050 --> 01:47:31,217
Aw, that's so sweet.

2092
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:32,967
What's up, Doc?

2093
01:47:33,050 --> 01:47:35,300
- Bugs! How did you...?
- Come on.

2094
01:47:35,383 --> 01:47:38,425
You didn't think you'd get rid
of me that easily, did you?

2095
01:47:38,508 --> 01:47:40,967
I told ya, I'm a Tune, Doc!

2096
01:47:41,050 --> 01:47:43,133
I can survive anything!

2097
01:47:43,217 --> 01:47:44,800
It's good to see you, buddy.

2098
01:47:44,883 --> 01:47:46,550
Oh, by the way,
you think I could

2099
01:47:46,633 --> 01:47:48,133
crash at your pad
for a few days?

2100
01:47:48,217 --> 01:47:49,967
Of course. There's more
than enough room for you.

2101
01:47:50,050 --> 01:47:52,008
Great! I've never been
to Tinseltown.

2102
01:47:52,092 --> 01:47:53,258
I wanna go on a star tour.

2103
01:47:53,342 --> 01:47:54,925
I hear they love
drinking juice here.

2104
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:56,342
Oh, do they make carrot juice?

2105
01:47:56,425 --> 01:47:57,758
They juice anything
for you here.

2106
01:47:57,842 --> 01:47:59,675
Oh, hey, can I stay
for Taco Tuesday?

2107
01:47:59,758 --> 01:48:01,758
Taco Tuesday!
No doubt.

2108
01:48:01,842 --> 01:48:03,758
Hope you and Mrs. LeBron
got bunk beds

2109
01:48:03,842 --> 01:48:05,925
'cause I got some friends
who wanna visit.

2110
01:48:06,008 --> 01:48:07,508
Hold up, hold up.
Bunk beds?

2111
01:48:07,592 --> 01:48:10,258
That's right. I brought
the whole gang with me!

2112
01:48:10,342 --> 01:48:11,550
What do you mean,
"the whole gang"?

2113
01:48:11,633 --> 01:48:13,383
You can't get rid
of us now, Doc.

2114
01:48:13,467 --> 01:48:15,050
We're family!

2115
01:55:19,008 --> 01:55:21,508
<i>That's all, folks.</i>
