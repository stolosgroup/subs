<i>Mayday, mayday!
We are under attack.</i>

3
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,958
<i>Under attack from our own people.</i>

4
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,583
<i>They just started shooting.
They took out everyone.</i>

5
00:00:56,666 --> 00:01:00,000
<i>- Why are they doing this?
- They're ours. What's happening?</i>

6
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,291
<i>How many are there?</i>

7
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:23,916
<i>They're everywhere!
They're going for the command center.</i>

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,333
<i>They're going to
take out the interceptors.</i>

9
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,708
<i>They're killing us,
they're killing everybody!</i>

10
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:45,333
<i>They reached the command center.
I can't hold them off!</i>

11
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,791
<i>Somebody help us!
Please, send help!</i>

12
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:52,166
<i>We've got to call SBX-1.</i>

13
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,375
<i>We can't!
They destroyed the transmitter!</i>

14
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:57,625
{\an8}<i>This is Fort Greely.
We have been overrun. Fort Greely...</i>

15
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,333
<i>Coming up on SBX-1 now, Captain.</i>

16
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,791
<i>SBX-1 this is Eagle 6-7.</i>

17
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,375
<i>I got your new
missile system specialist here with me.</i>

18
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,708
<i>Request permission
to commence final approach.</i>

19
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,083
<i>Eagle 6-7 this is SBX-1,
you're cleared for landing.</i>

20
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,958
<i>Welcome to the middle of nowhere.</i>

21
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,625
Captain Collins, I'm Ensign Washington.

22
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,791
Welcome to SBX-1,

23
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,333
or should I say "welcome back."

24
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,833
- Thanks.
- Colonel's waiting for you.

25
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,875
I heard you grew up in Spain
at a base your dad was posted at.

26
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,750
Come in.

27
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,666
Captain Collins reporting, sir.

28
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:19,750
At ease.

29
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,000
Good to see you again, JJ.

30
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,333
You remember Captain Welsh?

31
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes, sir. You were just
taking over when I rotated out.

32
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,416
Don't you mean escaped?

33
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,291
Listen to this.

34
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,708
- Give us a minute, would you, Lou?
- You bet.

35
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,875
See if you can get us
an update on that Russian sub.

36
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,833
Well, as you can see,

37
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,541
everything's pretty much
the way you left it.

38
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,250
Navy runs the boat,
Army handles the missiles,

39
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,250
and everyone wants
to be anywhere but here.

40
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,791
- Have you spoke with the board?
- Three times.

41
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,875
Showed them my record?
My reviews?

42
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:01,958
Everything.

43
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,458
This was the best you could do?

44
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
Sorry.

45
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,541
No, it's okay.

46
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,541
I thought I was done with this shit.

47
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:14,666
I know.

48
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,666
Never going to change, is it?

49
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,041
Thank you for taking me back.

50
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,166
For the record,
I believed you from the start.

51
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,583
We got you down here.

52
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,916
One of our guys nabbed your old room.

53
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,375
Sorry about that.

54
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,000
Oh, ma'am?

55
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,000
Just want to say

56
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,250
all of us girls
are really proud of what you did.

57
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,750
What happened to you, well it's…

58
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,875
It's happened to a lot of us,

59
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,708
and I just wanted you to know that.

60
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,916
I need you in the command center
with your sidearm now.

61
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,250
We have an active shooter situation
at Fort Greely.

62
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,208
Outsider?

63
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,666
No, one of ours. Looks like more than one.

64
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,875
Interceptors secure?

65
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,958
Unknown.

66
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,750
How bad is it?

67
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,291
Greely's gone dark. No calls in or out.

68
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,666
We're getting
all our information off Twitter.

69
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,958
Do we have Fort Greely
on the line?

70
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,166
Not yet, sir.

71
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,541
You know what to do.

72
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,416
Is Greely being jammed?

73
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,458
No. It's like someone
turned off the system at the source.

74
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,875
Corporal Rahul Shah.
Joined us six months ago.

75
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,708
Captain.

76
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:16,916
Corporal.

77
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,083
And you remember Beaver.

78
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,916
Miss me, Captain?

79
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,375
Not even once.

80
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,041
How's our Russian friend?

81
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,500
He's back.

82
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,500
Forty miles out and just sitting there
like a turd in a swimming pool.

83
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,708
- What friend?
- Russian attack sub.

84
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,291
Been nosing about for months.

85
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,208
Our subs keep chasing him away
and he keeps coming back.

86
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,166
What the hell's going on up there?

87
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,125
Hey. We still on for tonight?

88
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:47,875
Dude, what?

89
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,916
Poker. I want to whip
them janitors like last time.

90
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,125
- Not now, Beaver.
- What's wrong with now?

91
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,541
We're in an emergency.

92
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,708
Man, this ain't no emergency.

93
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,666
It's one crackpot with a grudge.

94
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,500
I'd invite you, ma'am,

95
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,083
but there'll probably be
a bit of locker room talk.

96
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:12,375
I've been practicing against
some of the best players in the world

97
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,791
with this little green guy.

98
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,666
Thing's probably more
powerful than this entire room.

99
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,166
Great story, Beaver.

100
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,708
In what chapter do you shut the fuck up?

101
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,708
Copy that, STRATCOM.

102
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,958
Sir, SBX-1 has just been assigned
primary early warning status

103
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,500
while Greely's offline.

104
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,791
All right, as of this moment
we're the only interceptor platform

105
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,666
protecting the United States
from a nuclear missile attack.

106
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,875
Square your shit away.

107
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,875
Focus on the job
you've been trained to do.

108
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,125
Sir, we sure this is not
some kind of drill or emergency test...

109
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,416
Quiet.

110
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,125
NSA is relaying chatter from Russia.

111
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:52,750
Kremlin just received a priority alert
from the ICBM missile base in Tavlinka.

112
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,166
Tavlinka site under hostile attack.

113
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,791
Multiple casualties.

114
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,000
Unauthorized missile removal.

115
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,708
No way.

116
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:06,166
Sixteen Topol-M mobile missiles
unaccounted for.

117
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,916
You're saying someone stole 16 ICBMs?

118
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,583
I'm not saying it. The Russians are.

119
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:12,875
Sir, Greely goes dark

120
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,708
and within 10 minutes
a Russian base reports stolen nukes?

121
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:18,833
Look, Greely's real,
but this has to be a Russian exercise.

122
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,791
If it were real,
the Pentagon would've called us by now.

123
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,500
SBX-1.

124
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,750
Yes, sir.

125
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,291
We are, sir.

126
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,041
It just came in now, sir.

127
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,458
We will, sir.

128
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:52,375
<i>We have 16 missiles
aimed at 16 American cities.</i>

129
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:58,083
<i>After this day,
America will no longer exist.</i>

130
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:59,833
Jesus.

131
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,541
How do you steal nuclear missiles?

132
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,750
Had to have been an inside job.
You can't just walk in...

133
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,375
Doesn't matter how they did it.
What matters is those missiles are mobile.

134
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,083
They can hide their nukes anywhere.

135
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,333
Our satellites
won't spot them till they launch.

136
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,625
Captain.

137
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,041
JJ.

138
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,708
This is on us now, you understand?

139
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:27,750
Yes, sir.

140
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,583
We're the only thing standing between
America and Armageddon.

141
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,375
You up for this?

142
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,958
Don't worry about me, sir.

143
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,291
Sorry. Had to ask.

144
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,083
I'll start the emergency lockdown.

145
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,125
You do that.

146
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,000
I need to find Welsh
and secure the HVAR codes.

147
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,833
Sir, wait

148
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:47,875
Sir.

149
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,875
If they had people inside Tavlinka,

150
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,000
and the shooters at Greely were all ours,

151
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:57,250
they might have someone… here.

152
00:11:58,791 --> 00:11:59,750
Go.

153
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:19,666
The key card!

154
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,125
The key card! Get the key card!

155
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,125
Mikael! The door. Open the door!

156
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,958
Goddammit, you're a big boy.

157
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,708
Did you send the SOS?

158
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,208
Did you just stab that dude
in the eye with your gun?

159
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,708
Yeah. Did you send the SOS?

160
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,375
Yeah, I sent it. They told me to stand by.

161
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,750
How is Beaver?

162
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,750
Bullet clipped him.
He's unconscious, but he'll be okay.

163
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,625
Is that acid?

164
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,083
Why would they bring acid?

165
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,833
Destroy the circuitry.

166
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,791
Make this place useless.

167
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:03,875
What are we going to do?

168
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,291
You want to talk about it?

169
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,750
Leave now and you might escape
with your life.

170
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,500
Let me in

171
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,000
and you might escape with yours.

172
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,166
You are the terrorists
who stole the missiles from Tavlinka?

173
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,458
<i>You know, it would be
a hell of a coincidence if I wasn't.</i>

174
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,625
Put one on Beaver.

175
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,000
And the shooters at Greely?

176
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,375
Subcontractors.

177
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,708
It's a gig economy.

178
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,875
Can't work at a US base without
an extensive background check.

179
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,500
You're telling me.
The paperwork is a nightmare.

180
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,625
That would mean
you've been planning this...

181
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,666
For a very long time.

182
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,833
How long is a very long time?

183
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,416
Six years.

184
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,541
Not going so well for you, is it?

185
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:21,625
No plan survives contact
with the enemy completely intact.

186
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,125
Are we enemies? You sound American.

187
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,291
<i>I am American.</i>

188
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,666
And whether or not you and I are enemies

189
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,625
is completely up to you.

190
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,083
What's your name?

191
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,500
My name is Alexander Kessel.

192
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,916
You say that like I should know it.

193
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,875
And now that you do,
you will never forget it.

194
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,125
How about I just call you "asshole"?

195
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:48,166
You know, usually it takes a woman
a second date to reach that conclusion.

196
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,041
Nothing usual about me.

197
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,416
You know, I'm kind of getting that.

198
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:05,875
So, Captain, seems as though
you and I are at an impasse

199
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,916
because I need
to disable your command center

200
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,125
so my people in Russia
can fire those missiles.

201
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,833
And you need to keep me out.

202
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,458
But, full disclosure,

203
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,125
I have contained or killed
everyone else on this vessel,

204
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,041
so I will be getting into that room.

205
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,791
Let me in now

206
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,333
and I will spare your lives.

207
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,791
And let millions of Americans die?

208
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,500
I don't think you realize
why someone joins the Army.

209
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,041
You are alone in the middle of the ocean,

210
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,291
miles from any port,

211
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,958
way beyond the nearest shipping lane.

212
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:47,291
No one is going to be able
to get here and save you

213
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,208
before I cut through these doors.

214
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,250
Hey, Shah, how many janitors are there?

215
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,125
I don't know. Six, seven?

216
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:58,375
- Which is it, six or seven?
- I don't know. I didn't hire them.

217
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,208
This is a big rig.

218
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,416
You couldn't have
killed everyone so quickly.

219
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,375
Nerve agent.

220
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,500
Released it through the A/C.
Put 'em all right to sleep.

221
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,083
Bullshit.

222
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,375
If it makes any difference,
they felt nothing.

223
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,708
We did have to shoot them to be sure.

224
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,291
<i>Don't worry.</i>

225
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,875
<i>The command center has its own A/C,
and try as I might…</i>

226
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:29,958
You can't access it.

227
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,125
Would we be having this
awesome little conversation if I could?

228
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,916
- SBX-1. This is Captain Collins.
<i>- Is this real?</i>

229
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,958
<i>- General Dyson. Where's Colonel Marshall?
- Everyone quiet.</i>

230
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,083
He's dead, sir.

231
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,791
<i>Dead? What happened?</i>

232
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,041
Six to seven terrorists
disguised as janitors seized our vessel.

233
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,666
They killed Marshall,
they claim they have killed the crew,

234
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,208
- and tried to take the command center.
- <i>Tried?</i>

235
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,791
- And failed.
<i>- Who's there with you?</i>

236
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,333
Corporals Shah and Baker.

237
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,666
Baker's unconscious. Hit by a bullet.

238
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,916
<i>How secure are you?</i>

239
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,791
They're using blowtorches
to cut through the outer door.

240
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:20,958
Best guess…

241
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,916
Sixty minutes.

242
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,083
Make that 30 minutes.

243
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,750
- <i>And the inner door?</i>
- Same. I don't know.

244
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,875
<i>What can you tell us
about these terrorists?</i>

245
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,875
American. Leader says
his name is Alexander Kessel.

246
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:47,708
<i>Get me a full background check
on this guy. What else?</i>

247
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,708
They move like they've been trained,

248
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,291
and they're using nerve agents.

249
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,041
What's happening at Greely?

250
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,041
<i>Shooters are dead.</i>

251
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,125
<i>Unfortunately, so are the computers
that control the interceptors.</i>

252
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,958
<i>Burned them all with acid.</i>

253
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,833
So it's just us.

254
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,083
<i>Afraid so.</i>

255
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,208
<i>A SEAL team is inbound to you.</i>

256
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,000
<i>You have to hang on a little longer.</i>

257
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,208
- ETA?
- <i>Ninety minutes.</i>

258
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,625
Are they joking?

259
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:12,000
<i>- No, we are not joking.</i>
- Madam President.

260
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,541
<i>The terrorists have
16 mobile missile launchers</i>

261
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,833
<i>that we and the Russians cannot find.</i>

262
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,041
<i>Only reason they haven't launched them yet</i>

263
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,291
<i>is because you
still have control of your interceptors.</i>

264
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,000
<i>The second you don't,</i>

265
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,333
<i>they will launch
those missiles on the United States.</i>

266
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:31,791
<i>Now, we don't have time
to evacuate 16 cities,</i>

267
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:35,708
<i>so we're counting on you
to keep those maniacs out of that room.</i>

268
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,708
Understood, Madam President.

269
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,458
<i>We'll get back to you soon.
Keep us updated.</i>

270
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,500
Yes, sir.

271
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,333
<i>Captain, hold that room.</i>

272
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:45,916
Let's move out! Go!

273
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,500
<i>SEAL team, you are clear
for immediate departure to SBX-1.</i>

274
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:00,166
Ninety minutes?
There's no way we can last that long.

275
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,583
Not without a fight.

276
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,958
What? No. No, no.

277
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,875
I'm not a fighter.
I'm a signal specialist.

278
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:11,000
I sit at a desk and stare at a screen,
and know what? I like it.

279
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,125
Know why? Because nothing ever happens.

280
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,333
I mean, I haven't fired a gun since basic.

281
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,666
Don't worry. Guns still work the same.

282
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,375
Look, you can't count on me. You can't.

283
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:40,958
You surrender?

284
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,291
<i>Do you?</i>

285
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,041
Still quite enjoying fucking up your day.

286
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,583
Do you know anything
about the fall of Rome?

287
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,958
When the barbarians
massed outside the city gates

288
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:57,208
they did unspeakable things to
try and force the Romans to let them in.

289
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:59,500
<i>Exitus act um pro bat.</i>

290
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:03,041
"The result justifies the deed."

291
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,250
You remember Captain Welsh?

292
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,750
He's a father of four
and a grandfather of seven.

293
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:12,458
<i>This is not gonna work.</i>

294
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:13,666
Open the doors.

295
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,125
You can't let him die.

296
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:19,583
I will not open these doors.

297
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,791
If you don't, I will kill him.

298
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:24,375
I will not open these doors.

299
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,041
Last chance.

300
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:32,208
No.

301
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:50,083
Kill anyone you want.

302
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,458
I will never open this door.

303
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,708
We're going to die too, aren't we?

304
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:15,083
We are not gonna die.

305
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,583
They're gonna get in here.
They're gonna kill us.

306
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,958
- Corporal.
- There's nothing we can do to stop them!

307
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:23,166
Corporal Shah, they're not in here yet,

308
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,250
but if we're going to keep them out,
I need you thinking clearly.

309
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,583
We still have a job to do, right?

310
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:31,583
Right.

311
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:35,583
So go back to your post
and keep our scanners on Tavlinka.

312
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:38,958
And if they launch?

313
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:40,291
We intercept.

314
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:01,416
We also need to figure out
every way they can penetrate this room.

315
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:06,041
Tunnel's the only direct way, in or out.

316
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:10,375
What about indirect? Any new piping
or conduits I should know about?

317
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:13,250
Plumbing comes through
a conduit in the floor

318
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:15,166
too small for anyone to fit through.

319
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,458
Same for the cables.

320
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:19,291
What else could they do? Think.

321
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:21,375
What about blowing the radar dome?

322
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,833
Dome's reinforced
even stronger than we are.

323
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:26,583
Same with the interceptors.

324
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:30,458
Get me eyes outside the hatches,
top and bottom.

325
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:02,000
Get the shotgun.

326
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:19,916
Shoot him!

327
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:21,958
Shoot him now!

328
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:02,250
Looks like it was just the one.

329
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:07,166
When was the last time
this thing was test fired?

330
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,000
I don't know. Can it still work?

331
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,375
Not without blowing up in your face.

332
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:13,666
- What about your pistol?
- Out.

333
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:16,833
So we have no weapons.

334
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:25,875
Help me.

335
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:31,041
Thanks for saving Turbo.

336
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:32,375
Who?

337
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:35,625
Turbo, the turtle. My kids gave him to me.

338
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:37,500
How many kids you got?

339
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:44,583
Prisha, she's nine. Aditi, seven.
And Kalyan, he's three.

340
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,208
I haven't seen them for six months.

341
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,916
Best thing you can do for them now
is help me stop those missiles.

342
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,125
Anything?

343
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:37,041
They got everyone.

344
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:45,541
He's just going
to keep buzzing till you answer.

345
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:48,833
What do you want now?

346
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:56,000
Captain, you should see this.

347
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:09,625
Think you're the first one
to throw that in my face?

348
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:11,333
<i>Think you're gonna break me?</i>

349
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:12,791
No.

350
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:14,375
And yes.

351
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:18,500
- <i>It's gonna take more than that.</i>
- I've got more coming.

352
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:19,458
<i>No, you don't.</i>

353
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:21,041
You're scrambling.

354
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:23,000
- <i>Am I?</i>
- Desperately.

355
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:24,333
How so?

356
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:25,750
You're a planner.

357
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:28,291
Six years, you said.

358
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:33,291
Looking for ways to beat the security,
getting your people aboard,

359
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:36,208
you must have gone over and over
these things

360
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:40,375
until you were absolutely sure
you planned for every possible outcome,

361
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:43,666
but you couldn't plan for me.

362
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:48,041
You know how I know?

363
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:53,250
Because I'm meant to be
in Fort Hunter right now on my new post.

364
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,875
Only fell through late last night
when they reassigned me here.

365
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:58,708
And now…

366
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:07,791
Now you can't beat me.

367
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,541
<i>I'll give you "unexpected."</i>

368
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:15,916
<i>But not unbeatable.</i>

369
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:18,458
<i>See, here's what I know.</i>

370
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:22,875
<i>I know that three years ago,
you scored your dream job.</i>

371
00:30:22,958 --> 00:30:26,333
<i>Pentagon, three-star General.</i>

372
00:30:26,416 --> 00:30:28,833
<i>A battlefield hero, his troops loved him.</i>

373
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:32,125
<i>They were going to
build a statue to the guy.</i>

374
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,541
<i>And he promised to take you
all the way to the top,</i>

375
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:39,916
<i>but then you learned
the price you'd have to pay.</i>

376
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:46,833
I know the Army review board
just decided you made it all up.

377
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:49,958
<i>Threw you right back into the lion's den.</i>

378
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,958
<i>I know that three-star
welcomed you with open arms.</i>

379
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:04,125
<i>Because predators always want
to show you exactly who's in charge.</i>

380
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:33,291
Wait, that general got discharged.

381
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:36,166
Which means you beat him. You won.

382
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:39,250
She won the battle, not the war.

383
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:42,541
<i>See, first came the hate mail.</i>

384
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:48,541
<i>The bounty hunt for these lewd photos…</i>

385
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:54,416
<i>…then the death threats.</i>

386
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,750
All from within the army
that you so proudly served.

387
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:01,916
Then finally…

388
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:04,833
That night.

389
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:58,666
JJ! JJ!

390
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:08,416
JJ, come on!

391
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:11,625
Come on, wake up. JJ!

392
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:15,000
Come on. Wake up. Come back.

393
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:16,000
Papa?

394
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:19,458
It's okay, it's okay. Papa's here.
It's okay. I got you.

395
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:21,416
Papa… sorry.

396
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:37,958
You are beatable, Captain.

397
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,041
It's been proven.

398
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,291
If you are so right,

399
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:49,125
then what am I doing here?

400
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:51,916
Why do I still wear the uniform?

401
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:56,666
War's not over yet, motherfucker.

402
00:33:58,083 --> 00:33:59,916
You should be working with me.

403
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:03,291
In fact,
I will give you 30 million dollars

404
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,625
if you open these doors.

405
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:07,750
I will have you flown
to the country of your choosing

406
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:10,500
where you can live
the rest of your life in luxury.

407
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:15,083
If anyone has earned the right
to walk away from this, it's you.

408
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:19,458
Thirty million dollars.

409
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:21,375
What did the Army ever give you?

410
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:23,666
Your depressing old job
in the middle of nowhere,

411
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,291
where they can forget about you?

412
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:27,041
They don't care about you.

413
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:30,458
Open these doors.

414
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:33,500
Take back your power.

415
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:37,000
That's how you win a war.

416
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:48,416
<i>SEAL team is inbound to SBX-1.
ETA 67 minutes.</i>

417
00:34:57,958 --> 00:34:59,541
They're in.

418
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:22,333
Open the door
and you leave here a wealthy woman.

419
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:27,083
We still have time
before you cut through this door.

420
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:29,375
You really don't.

421
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:36,250
- Beaver.
- What?

422
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:51,291
Nice, Beaver.

423
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:02,958
Initiating satellite relay and EBS hack.

424
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,000
We're in.

425
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:12,416
No, I have a new one.

426
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:17,791
ZSB, Zulu Sierra Bravo, 1-9-9-6.

427
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:20,125
And tell Danny to move in.

428
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:33,666
Are you hurt?

429
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,250
I've had worse.

430
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:43,166
It really didn't have to be this way.

431
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:47,583
If Corporal Baker doesn't get hit,
we avoid all of this.

432
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:50,000
If you're gonna kill me, just kill me.

433
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,625
No mansplaining.

434
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:54,708
I gave you choices.

435
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:57,625
It was your decision to become enemies.

436
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,375
You were with them this whole time?

437
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:05,541
Yeah.

438
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:07,375
Traitor.

439
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:09,708
America's the traitor.

440
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:12,833
Always were full of shit,
Beaver.

441
00:37:12,916 --> 00:37:14,750
Ah, what do you know?

442
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,833
I love my country.

443
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:20,000
Hell, there was a time
I would have even died for it.

444
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:21,500
Never too late.

445
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:23,958
Shut up.

446
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:27,875
It's because of immigrants like you

447
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:29,291
and like you

448
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:30,708
that I lost my job

449
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:32,208
and the government

450
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,916
took away my rights,

451
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:40,041
started making up
all kinds of shit to scare me.

452
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:42,291
Shit.

453
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,250
I don't even recognize America these days.

454
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:49,625
And that gives you the right
to murder millions of people?

455
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:52,708
Well, it gives me the right
to start looking out for myself.

456
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:56,416
And now I got ten million ways to do that.

457
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,458
Money? That's what this is about?

458
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:00,625
Uh, yeah.

459
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:02,375
It's what America's about.

460
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:04,958
And if you don't get that,

461
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:08,291
you obviously haven't been
paying attention, Shah.

462
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:09,416
Wake up, man.

463
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,250
Yeah, sure. Sure. Blame America.
Blame the government.

464
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,291
Blame everyone else but you.

465
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:17,416
That's what all losers do.

466
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:28,666
You just keep on talking, darlin'.

467
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,375
Because before this is all over,

468
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:34,958
I'm gonna do to you

469
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:38,875
what every enlisted grunt
secretly wants to do

470
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:41,125
to every female officer.

471
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:45,958
The only way you can get it, isn't it?

472
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:51,625
Hey. Another thing.

473
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:55,750
Never call a woman
by anything other than her name.

474
00:38:56,333 --> 00:39:01,250
Not honey, or honey pie,
or sugar, or sugar pie,

475
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:03,416
or sweetie, or sweetie pie.

476
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,500
Not baby, sweetheart, ho, bitch,

477
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,250
and above all,
most of all, beyond all else,

478
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:15,125
don't ever,

479
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:16,666
ever,

480
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:18,958
call her "darlin'."

481
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:25,750
Shit.

482
00:39:28,291 --> 00:39:30,625
Satellite relay's live on the EBS.

483
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:32,208
The Emergency Broadcast System?

484
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:34,666
Yeah, so that every camera on this rig

485
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:38,125
can be broadcast to any device
that has smart capabilities.

486
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:41,750
Wouldn't want anyone missing the show.

487
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:48,500
<i>Mr. Kessel. Where's Captain Collins?</i>

488
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:51,083
She's here. She's unharmed.

489
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:53,333
Well… relatively.

490
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:55,750
As is Corporal Shah.

491
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:57,250
<i>And Corporal Baker?</i>

492
00:39:58,791 --> 00:40:00,000
Howdy, General.

493
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:01,625
<i>You two are servicemen.</i>

494
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:03,000
<i>You took an oath.</i>

495
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:04,833
<i>How could you betray your country?</i>

496
00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:08,375
I swore an oath to the old America.
Not this one.

497
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:10,583
<i>What do you want?</i>

498
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:13,125
From you?

499
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:16,416
Nothing.

500
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,833
I'm just waiting for America
to join our little chat here.

501
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:24,166
Dad's proud. That must be nice.

502
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:33,291
EBS has slaved all signals.

503
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:35,333
Say hello to America, boss.

504
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:59,458
So you know it's got a big screen,
great picture quality, you know,

505
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:00,750
the sound's kind of meh,

506
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,125
but I don't really listen
to the TV that much.

507
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:05,875
I play music when I watch and stuff
so it doesn't really…

508
00:41:05,958 --> 00:41:07,291
Why'd it go black and white?

509
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:08,708
Where's the President?

510
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:09,708
<i>I'm here.</i>

511
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:12,291
<i>If you launch even one of those missiles,</i>

512
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:15,583
{\an8}<i>I swear before God
that we will hunt you down</i>

513
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:17,500
{\an8}<i>and wipe you from existence.</i>

514
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:20,625
<i>That's enough. You're boring me.</i>

515
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:23,125
<i>I'm taking your bully pulpit now.</i>

516
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:27,416
My fellow Americans,

517
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:31,750
I am Alexander Kessel,

518
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:36,500
son of trust fund billionaire,
Alexander Kessel Senior,

519
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:38,541
who you may also know

520
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:46,208
is the current utterly unqualified
US ambassador to the United Nations.

521
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:53,125
Now, my associates in Russia
control 16 nuclear missiles,

522
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:56,666
<i>and I control
the only interceptor missiles</i>

523
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,791
<i>that are capable of stopping them.</i>

524
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:01,791
Sixteen American cities
have been targeted.

525
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:06,791
300 million of you will die.

526
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:11,000
One city will be destroyed first

527
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:14,500
so that the rest of you
can watch in horror.

528
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:17,375
Missile team one…

529
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:19,750
Fire.

530
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:29,291
<i>Missile launch detected.
Missile launch detected.</i>

531
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:30,625
<i>Missile launch detected.</i>

532
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:34,458
{\an8}<i>Intercept launch expires in 12 minutes.</i>

533
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:37,791
Now in 12 minutes,
that missile I just launched,

534
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:39,666
will pass over my head,

535
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,708
at which point, it will be too late
for this interceptor to catch it.

536
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:47,875
But which city has been chosen?

537
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:51,250
Is it yours?

538
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,666
Wherever it lands, there's no time to run.

539
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:57,583
You can't flee.

540
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:01,708
If you guessed Los Angeles,

541
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:04,291
congratulations.

542
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,875
<i>The City of Angels
has 23 minutes left to live.</i>

543
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,833
Wait a second.

544
00:43:09,916 --> 00:43:11,875
<i>Once Los Angeles is gone,</i>

545
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:14,916
<i>And the fear of every American
is at its peak…</i>

546
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,291
We're not closing yet.

547
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:18,416
<i>…I will launch a second wave</i>

548
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,208
of 15 nuclear missiles.

549
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:22,875
San Francisco, Seattle, Las Vegas,

550
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:28,625
Cincinnati, Dallas, Denver, Memphis,
Chicago, St. Louis, Atlanta, Boston,

551
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:30,833
Philadelphia, Miami, New York.

552
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:35,666
And of course, Washington DC.

553
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:39,916
Today…

554
00:43:41,916 --> 00:43:43,333
America dies

555
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:45,958
in a paroxysm of fear.

556
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,500
<i>America is the greatest lie ever told.</i>

557
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:00,958
<i>American exceptionalism?</i>

558
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:01,958
Maybe once.

559
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:05,541
When the founders got rid of kings.

560
00:44:07,166 --> 00:44:09,500
When they declared
that all men are created equal.

561
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:12,541
Now they say ours are United States,
but when was that true?

562
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:14,458
<i>Was it true during the Civil War?</i>

563
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:16,416
<i>Or Jim Crow?</i>

564
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,041
Hell, is it true now?

565
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:20,958
You know, this national lie,

566
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,166
it's a festering wound,

567
00:44:24,541 --> 00:44:25,791
and it's fatal.

568
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:28,250
There's no Band-Aid to patch it.

569
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,000
No, the only way to save our nation
and the promise it once held

570
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:35,708
is to erase it.

571
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:37,833
Start over.

572
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:39,083
So maybe then.

573
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,458
{\an8}When we are staring at each other

574
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:44,125
from across the rubble,

575
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:48,541
we will all agree that this time

576
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:51,958
we're going to get America right.

577
00:44:57,666 --> 00:44:59,666
This is Corporal Rahul Shah.

578
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:01,875
<i>Do you like being an American, Rahul?</i>

579
00:45:01,958 --> 00:45:03,291
<i>With all my heart.</i>

580
00:45:04,291 --> 00:45:05,458
<i>But you're a Hindu.</i>

581
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:06,583
<i>You can be both.</i>

582
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:07,708
<i>In America?</i>

583
00:45:08,416 --> 00:45:10,416
You've never been mocked for your faith?

584
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:15,791
Never been the subject
to enhanced screenings at airports?

585
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:19,875
<i>Share with the world what you've seen.</i>

586
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:23,125
<i>I've seen you in the showers,</i>

587
00:45:24,416 --> 00:45:26,875
<i>and I can see
why you're obsessed with missiles.</i>

588
00:45:29,875 --> 00:45:31,041
Pathetic.

589
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:33,500
I got this, boss.

590
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:50,666
<i>This is Captain Joanna Julia Collins.</i>

591
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,500
<i>JJ to her friends.</i>

592
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:56,625
<i>A soldier who has fought with
honor and courage here today.</i>

593
00:45:56,708 --> 00:46:00,458
<i>Now, three years ago,
one of our nation's top generals</i>

594
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:05,083
<i>tried to abuse his position of power
and force her to have sex with him.</i>

595
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:07,833
<i>Whose career was ruined?</i>

596
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:09,041
You should be

597
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:12,208
showering her with praise,

598
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:13,791
but she's a woman,

599
00:46:15,208 --> 00:46:18,708
so instead her fellow service members

600
00:46:18,791 --> 00:46:22,166
put out a bounty hunt on photos like this.

601
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,125
You're an asshole, dude.

602
00:46:24,208 --> 00:46:28,125
<i>I offered her 30 million dollars
to give up her post today.</i>

603
00:46:30,708 --> 00:46:31,875
<i>She refused.</i>

604
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:40,458
<i>She took that photo
for charity, by the way.</i>

605
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:44,250
What position were you?
Were you goalkeeper?

606
00:46:45,375 --> 00:46:48,291
Goalkeeper. It's a tough position.

607
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:50,166
Beg your pardon?

608
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:54,916
You take a lot of hits,
concussions, bruised ribs,

609
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,666
but the most common injury
is dislocated thumbs.

610
00:47:01,708 --> 00:47:02,958
Oh shit.

611
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:26,583
No!

612
00:47:26,666 --> 00:47:28,125
Shit!

613
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:38,375
<i>Intercept launch expires
in six minutes.</i>

614
00:47:43,416 --> 00:47:44,875
Think you can make it?

615
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,041
Do you?

616
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:52,083
<i>Intercept launch expires
in five minutes.</i>

617
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:54,333
You have five minutes.
Hold her or kill her.

618
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:43,625
<i>Interceptor launched.</i>

619
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:01,333
<i>Missile intercepted.</i>

620
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:11,041
Fucking die already, would you?

621
00:51:27,666 --> 00:51:31,708
- I warned you, man.
- I told you she was bad news.

622
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:36,833
Remember? I said, "Whatever happens,
make sure you shoot her first."

623
00:51:36,916 --> 00:51:40,000
"You just take her out of the fight,
because if you don't do that,

624
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:43,333
if you don't just put her down right
away, man, she's gonna be trouble."

625
00:51:43,416 --> 00:51:44,333
Beaver.

626
00:51:44,416 --> 00:51:46,708
She's…
She's just one of those women, you know?

627
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:50,208
She just likes to just get under your skin
and just needle you, man.

628
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:53,083
Like a… like a fucking needle.

629
00:51:53,166 --> 00:51:55,291
This is a setback and nothing more.

630
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:56,250
Setback?

631
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:58,333
Oh. Good.

632
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:00,875
Hey, did you hear that?
It's a setback. That's cool.

633
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,750
She shot the goddamn missile
out of the sky!

634
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:07,666
It's one missile. There are 15 left.

635
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,125
And what happens
if she shoots them down too, huh?

636
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:12,125
What then? What do we do then?

637
00:52:14,083 --> 00:52:16,708
Our faces, man,
they're all over the world right now.

638
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:17,916
What do we do then?

639
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:21,250
What's the statute of limitations
on attempted nuking?

640
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:23,791
We are prepared for this.
We have backup plans.

641
00:52:31,458 --> 00:52:32,375
No, no.

642
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:36,416
Fuck.

643
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,541
Really?

644
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,250
<i>You played that one
pretty close to the buzzer.</i>

645
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:35,333
Doing my best here, ma'am.

646
00:53:35,416 --> 00:53:37,083
<i>Can you turn off the TV coverage?</i>

647
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:40,166
Give me a minute.

648
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:45,541
Not from here.

649
00:53:46,125 --> 00:53:47,250
<i>Understood.</i>

650
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:49,625
How long till the SEALS get here?

651
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:52,041
<i>Fifty minutes.
They're going as fast as they can.</i>

652
00:53:52,791 --> 00:53:54,333
Not fast enough.

653
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:57,250
<i>And we got some background
on Alexander Kessel.</i>

654
00:53:57,333 --> 00:53:59,083
<i>He was Army, military intelligence.</i>

655
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:00,666
<i>Started out doing Russian work,</i>

656
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:03,083
<i>then became a psy ops
and torture specialist.</i>

657
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:04,083
Torture?

658
00:54:04,166 --> 00:54:06,500
<i>He was good. Too good sometimes.</i>

659
00:54:06,583 --> 00:54:08,875
<i>Killed two prisoners
while he was torturing them.</i>

660
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:11,666
{\an8}Jesus. I'm dealing
with a genuine psychopath.

661
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:16,166
{\an8}<i>You're not alone. Lot of smart people here
trying to figure out a way to help you.</i>

662
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,041
<i>Tacticians, game theorists.</i>

663
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:19,541
<i>Fuck theory.</i>

664
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:21,833
<i>I need some fucking soldiers with guns.</i>

665
00:54:21,916 --> 00:54:22,916
<i>I hear you, Captain.</i>

666
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,833
Come on, give her some guns, man.

667
00:54:24,916 --> 00:54:27,833
<i>If you don't mind me saying,
you are one armor-plated woman.</i>

668
00:54:27,916 --> 00:54:30,000
<i>Army never should have
picked a fight with you.</i>

669
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:33,958
Got that right.

670
00:54:40,791 --> 00:54:41,833
Rahul.

671
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:43,708
What'd I miss?

672
00:54:46,041 --> 00:54:47,250
Not much.

673
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:48,625
Did we stop the missile?

674
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:53,250
Yeah. We stopped it.

675
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:55,291
Nice.

676
00:54:56,583 --> 00:54:58,583
Wait. Where's all the bad guys?

677
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:04,208
Oh…

678
00:55:07,458 --> 00:55:10,208
That Alexander dude must be pissed at you.

679
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:15,291
Yeah, well, that's because
I'm still fucking up his day.

680
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:33,833
Papa?

681
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:35,791
Hey. How you feeling?

682
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,041
You up for some soup?

683
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:40,875
Sure.

684
00:55:54,875 --> 00:55:56,083
You saw what they did.

685
00:55:56,166 --> 00:55:57,500
I'll take care of it.

686
00:55:57,583 --> 00:56:02,041
Do not let them get to you now.
Don't let them win.

687
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:03,583
They hate me.

688
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:05,041
You told the truth.

689
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:06,875
Nobody cares about the truth.

690
00:56:06,958 --> 00:56:08,166
I care.

691
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:13,333
I've lost everything.
Everything I ever worked for.

692
00:56:13,416 --> 00:56:14,541
Hey, hey.

693
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:18,708
What's the one thing
I've taught you since you were little?

694
00:56:19,208 --> 00:56:21,416
The one rule in life?

695
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:26,833
Never stop fighting.

696
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:28,666
You got fight in you, kid.

697
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:31,958
Always have. Just like your mama.

698
00:56:41,416 --> 00:56:42,416
Captain?

699
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,166
He wants to talk.

700
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,083
How long have I been out?

701
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:52,333
Not long. Fifteen minutes or so.

702
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:05,708
What now, asshole?

703
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:12,875
You think I'm a monster.

704
00:57:16,125 --> 00:57:17,125
I was.

705
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:23,875
You know, growing up, I never summered
where I wintered.

706
00:57:23,958 --> 00:57:28,291
I was either on a yacht in the Hamptons
or skiing in Val d'Isère.

707
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,916
Sucks to be you, dude.

708
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:33,250
I'm not complaining.

709
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:35,750
I was the product of a failed society.

710
00:57:35,833 --> 00:57:40,833
A society that consistently rewards money
and ignores everything else.

711
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:44,750
What? You think my father
became ambassador to the UN

712
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:48,291
because of any
worthwhile diplomatic skills

713
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:50,375
or because of his political donations?

714
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:53,000
See, that's what we do in America.

715
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:56,791
We just figure because someone's rich
that means they're smart.

716
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,958
My father's a moron.

717
00:58:02,833 --> 00:58:04,000
He inherited his money.

718
00:58:04,083 --> 00:58:05,333
- He didn't earn it.
- God.

719
00:58:05,416 --> 00:58:07,416
Don't tell me this is about daddy issues.

720
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,333
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

721
00:58:09,416 --> 00:58:10,875
I understand plenty.

722
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:13,291
Your father is a good man.

723
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:14,875
The best.

724
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:18,166
He served too, didn't he?

725
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:20,083
Thirty-six years.

726
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:23,125
That's how he met your mom?
When he was stationed in Spain?

727
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:26,625
Does he still hang out
with his army buddies?

728
00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:28,291
Every day.

729
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:32,541
In Scottsdale, right?

730
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:35,833
Yeah.

731
00:58:37,416 --> 00:58:41,250
The Patriot's Valley
Veterans Retirement Home.

732
00:58:42,791 --> 00:58:44,041
Room 6B.

733
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:51,250
Papa?

734
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:54,833
Let him go!

735
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:57,208
- He's got nothing to do with this!
- Beg to differ.

736
00:58:57,291 --> 00:58:58,208
Let him go!

737
00:58:58,291 --> 00:59:01,125
You said I could kill whoever,
and you'd never open this door.

738
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:03,125
Let him go, God damn you!

739
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:06,458
- Let's see if that's still valid.
- Fuck you!

740
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:08,458
You think it's going to go any other way?

741
00:59:08,541 --> 00:59:11,541
This is what I was trained for.
Psy ops. Military intelligence.

742
00:59:11,625 --> 00:59:13,958
Find your enemy's
weak point and exploit it.

743
00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:16,250
<i>Let him go!</i>

744
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:17,666
If you don't open the door,

745
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,750
I will take apart
your father piece by piece.

746
00:59:19,833 --> 00:59:20,750
No!

747
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:23,583
- Fine. Have it your way.
- No, no! Please.

748
00:59:23,666 --> 00:59:24,541
No, no, no!

749
00:59:24,625 --> 00:59:25,541
- Do it.
- No, no, no!

750
00:59:25,625 --> 00:59:26,916
No, don't! No!

751
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,708
No, no, no!

752
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:36,583
- You know I can't.
- Yes, you can.

753
00:59:36,666 --> 00:59:39,250
- No, I can't.
- You can make this stop whenever you want.

754
00:59:39,333 --> 00:59:40,416
Let me speak with him.

755
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:41,791
Let me speak with him. Okay?

756
00:59:41,875 --> 00:59:43,750
- Let me speak with him!
- Captain, no.

757
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:45,666
Let her speak.

758
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,083
Papa?

759
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:49,583
<i>- JJ.</i>
- I can't…

760
00:59:49,666 --> 00:59:51,791
I can't… I can't lose you.

761
00:59:51,875 --> 00:59:54,416
<i>Listen to me. Are you listening?</i>

762
00:59:56,458 --> 00:59:58,666
<i>Never stop fighting!</i>

763
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:00,583
- Kill him.
- No! No!

764
01:00:00,666 --> 01:00:03,250
No, please God. God!

765
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:04,166
No!

766
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:07,458
No, no!

767
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:23,666
No…

768
01:00:26,125 --> 01:00:27,041
No!

769
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,958
My daddy would have
made me open that door.

770
01:00:33,208 --> 01:00:34,375
No question!

771
01:01:00,541 --> 01:01:02,000
How did they know?

772
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:06,708
How did they know
to have people in Scottsdale?

773
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:11,833
The Army signed
your transfer order last night, right?

774
01:01:11,916 --> 01:01:13,625
Right.

775
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:16,708
Which means they couldn't
have known until a few hours ago.

776
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:21,833
You still don't get it?
You're a pariah in your own ranks.

777
01:01:22,333 --> 01:01:24,958
The decision to have you
transferred to this godforsaken rig

778
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:27,458
was made three days ago.
They only told you last night.

779
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:29,958
I've known for 72 hours.

780
01:01:31,958 --> 01:01:35,333
- What are you doing?
- Activating my insurance policy.

781
01:01:37,333 --> 01:01:39,791
If she's committed enough
to watch her father die,

782
01:01:40,291 --> 01:01:42,291
you will find
that I am equally as committed.

783
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:45,166
That's the HVAR code.
The emergency sinking protocol.

784
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:47,000
You're going to sink this whole rig?

785
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:03,291
<i>Our telemetry's saying SBX-1's
asset removal protocol just activated.</i>

786
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:04,500
<i>Don't tell me he...</i>

787
01:02:04,583 --> 01:02:06,291
He's going to sink us.

788
01:02:06,375 --> 01:02:08,958
He's going to sink us
using our own scuttling protocol.

789
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:12,708
<i>High value asset
removal protocol activated.</i>

790
01:02:20,375 --> 01:02:21,291
What do we do?

791
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:25,208
As long as we are above the surface,
we can still fire our missiles.

792
01:02:27,916 --> 01:02:30,916
<i>Thirteen minutes until
total vessel submersion.</i>

793
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,458
We've got 13 minutes
to figure out a solution.

794
01:02:34,541 --> 01:02:35,500
I'm going down there.

795
01:02:35,583 --> 01:02:37,375
Down where? Into the hulls?

796
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:40,541
Yes. To close the valves one by one.

797
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:42,750
You can't go down
there with wounds like that.

798
01:02:43,875 --> 01:02:45,000
I'll manage.

799
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:46,833
I'll… I'll go.

800
01:02:47,416 --> 01:02:48,375
No.

801
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:51,375
I'll do it.

802
01:02:56,375 --> 01:02:58,875
<i>You're running out of time.
We clock it at 13 minutes.</i>

803
01:02:58,958 --> 01:03:00,166
So do we.

804
01:03:00,791 --> 01:03:02,500
What's the ETA on the SEAL team?

805
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:03,416
<i>Twenty-five.</i>

806
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:06,250
Damn. I'll call you back.

807
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,333
All right.

808
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:20,375
Don't think this is what heroes look like.

809
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:23,458
That's exactly what they look like.

810
01:03:24,458 --> 01:03:25,958
Whatever you say, Captain.

811
01:03:30,291 --> 01:03:31,666
You can do this.

812
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:34,833
You got this, Rahul.

813
01:03:34,916 --> 01:03:36,291
You got this.

814
01:03:38,791 --> 01:03:40,000
See you on the other side.

815
01:03:51,291 --> 01:03:53,041
Little bastard grew some balls.

816
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:55,250
Take care of it.

817
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:57,708
This is mine.

818
01:04:02,083 --> 01:04:04,416
HVAR's been activated.
Twelve and a half minutes.

819
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:06,750
Well, how far away is he?

820
01:04:12,083 --> 01:04:14,333
<i>Twenty-two minutes out.
Ready your weapons.</i>

821
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:32,333
Okay, I've reached the hull.

822
01:04:32,416 --> 01:04:33,625
You see the console?

823
01:04:43,916 --> 01:04:45,666
This is gonna take a while.

824
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:48,666
- <i>You just have to slow it down.</i>
- Copy that.

825
01:04:57,875 --> 01:04:59,291
How are we looking, Captain?

826
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:01,333
<i>Recalculating.
Recalculating.</i>

827
01:05:01,416 --> 01:05:05,000
<i>- 12 minutes 11 seconds until…</i>
- You just bought us two minutes.

828
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:06,125
<i>Keep going.</i>

829
01:05:06,208 --> 01:05:09,583
Hell, yeah. I'm an ass-kicking,
valve-closing machine.

830
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:11,750
<i>Nobody plugs leaks like me.</i>

831
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:14,791
Oh…

832
01:05:15,375 --> 01:05:17,291
- Oh. Shit.
- What?

833
01:05:17,375 --> 01:05:18,875
I got company.

834
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:20,958
Get out of there. You hear me?

835
01:05:21,458 --> 01:05:22,541
<i>It's too late.</i>

836
01:05:22,625 --> 01:05:24,791
It's not too late. Get out of there, now.

837
01:05:24,875 --> 01:05:27,333
I'm sorry I couldn't help you
more before, Captain,

838
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:29,250
but I'm hoping this helps you now.

839
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:31,416
<i>Recalculating.
Recalculating.</i>

840
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:37,416
Tell my children I love them.

841
01:05:42,958 --> 01:05:44,125
Howdy.

842
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:46,166
You don't have to do this, Beaver.

843
01:05:48,708 --> 01:05:50,125
You're not a murderer.

844
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:54,291
You're right.

845
01:05:57,333 --> 01:05:58,708
I'm not a murderer.

846
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:05,458
I'm a fucking patriot.

847
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,333
Rahul?

848
01:06:13,583 --> 01:06:14,458
Rahul?

849
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:18,333
<i>Shah can't come to the phone right now.</i>

850
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,833
<i>It's just you and the three of us.</i>

851
01:06:23,125 --> 01:06:24,500
You're dead.

852
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:32,500
It was a valiant attempt.

853
01:06:34,291 --> 01:06:36,333
I admire his courage, truly.

854
01:06:37,958 --> 01:06:40,166
To be honest, I'd written him off.

855
01:06:40,958 --> 01:06:43,000
His psych evaluation
said he'd fold under pressure.

856
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:44,958
I didn't even bother
to put people on his family.

857
01:06:45,791 --> 01:06:47,666
Turns out, he almost derailed me.

858
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:56,958
Danilov.

859
01:06:57,041 --> 01:06:58,625
No, I have a new one.

860
01:06:59,291 --> 01:07:04,958
ZSB, Zulu, Sierra, Bravo, 1-9-9-6.

861
01:07:06,416 --> 01:07:07,750
Tell Danny to move in.

862
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:09,625
Danny?

863
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:30,000
Cut the feed.

864
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:32,416
That means nothing.

865
01:07:33,291 --> 01:07:35,541
Then you won't mind
if I show it to the world.

866
01:07:39,541 --> 01:07:40,625
Fine.

867
01:07:52,041 --> 01:07:53,333
What the hell just happened?

868
01:07:54,958 --> 01:07:58,208
ZSB. Zurich Schweitz Bank.

869
01:07:58,291 --> 01:08:00,125
That's a Swiss bank account.

870
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:02,208
I should have known.

871
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:04,583
You're not
a nuclear terrorist or a fanatic.

872
01:08:04,666 --> 01:08:05,958
You've been paid for this.

873
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:08,625
Hey, this is my operation.
I'm the one in charge.

874
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:11,833
So what if I'm getting paid? Huh?
Am I wrong?

875
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:15,625
I'm destroying a system
that tried to destroy you.

876
01:08:15,708 --> 01:08:18,875
I'm making sure what happened to you
doesn't happen to other women.

877
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:20,375
How much?

878
01:08:20,458 --> 01:08:21,750
What are you doing?

879
01:08:21,833 --> 01:08:23,208
Who's paying you?

880
01:08:24,666 --> 01:08:26,458
Seriously, stop with the tape.

881
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:29,875
What about the Russian sub?

882
01:08:29,958 --> 01:08:31,541
Stop taping the window?

883
01:08:32,583 --> 01:08:36,000
The Danilov, huh? Yeah, how's Danny?

884
01:08:36,083 --> 01:08:37,583
Can you please…

885
01:08:37,666 --> 01:08:40,083
Please stop taping the window. For me?

886
01:08:40,166 --> 01:08:43,333
You paid off a sub captain.
Where is he taking you?

887
01:08:43,416 --> 01:08:45,125
Stop taping the window.

888
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:48,416
Someplace you can
get a new name, a new face?

889
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:51,208
Somewhere you can spend your blood money?

890
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:54,750
Stop with the damn tape, JJ.

891
01:08:56,458 --> 01:08:58,458
What about all
that shit about your father?

892
01:08:58,541 --> 01:09:01,125
Oh, fuck him. He ruined my family's name!

893
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:04,125
Today I restore it
with dignity and respect.

894
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:07,875
Bullshit. I saw your file.

895
01:09:07,958 --> 01:09:10,333
You're just a total fucking psycho.

896
01:09:12,041 --> 01:09:13,958
- Thank you.
- For what?

897
01:09:14,791 --> 01:09:18,041
- For showing me your weakness.
- Oh, yeah. What's that?

898
01:09:18,125 --> 01:09:19,958
You want to get out of here alive.

899
01:09:20,041 --> 01:09:23,000
You know what else I want?
I want to hurt you, JJ.

900
01:09:23,083 --> 01:09:26,041
I want to cut off your fingers.
I want you to beg me to kill you!

901
01:09:26,125 --> 01:09:27,083
<i>Cabrón.</i>

902
01:09:36,541 --> 01:09:40,750
<i>Good job cutting the live feed.
SEALS are 17 minutes out.</i>

903
01:09:40,833 --> 01:09:42,791
Well, that's not fast enough.

904
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:45,958
This rig is going to sink in 15 minutes.

905
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:47,500
And the second it goes under,

906
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:49,500
these assholes
will launch all their nukes.

907
01:09:49,583 --> 01:09:50,916
<i>Is there anything you can do?</i>

908
01:09:57,875 --> 01:09:59,291
I sort of have this plan.

909
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:03,166
- But it's a little counter intuitive.
<i>- Let's hear it, Captain.</i>

910
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:06,541
I let them take the command center.

911
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:09,166
<i>What? That's precisely
what we don't want to happen.</i>

912
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:12,625
This rig is going down,
and when it sinks, they win.

913
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:16,166
We have to force them
to fire the missiles before that happens.

914
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:17,583
<i>And then what?</i>

915
01:10:17,666 --> 01:10:20,458
And then I retake the command center

916
01:10:20,541 --> 01:10:22,041
and intercept their nukes.

917
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:23,500
<i>Inside 12 minutes?</i>

918
01:10:24,625 --> 01:10:25,541
Yes, sir.

919
01:10:25,625 --> 01:10:26,666
<i>Hold on.</i>

920
01:10:30,208 --> 01:10:31,208
Fuck.

921
01:10:31,291 --> 01:10:33,708
<i>Our game theory specialist
is not convinced.</i>

922
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:36,250
<i>He's uh… concerned about your motivations.</i>

923
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:37,541
<i>By my calculations,</i>

924
01:10:37,625 --> 01:10:40,583
<i>your proposed plan
has a 14% chance of success.</i>

925
01:10:40,666 --> 01:10:42,916
<i>To give up that command center
to a superior force</i>

926
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,666
<i>with no certainty of regaining it</i>

927
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:47,625
<i>is what we refer to as
a negative outcome inducing event.</i>

928
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:49,708
Are you serious with this shit?

929
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:51,875
<i>Are you willing to gamble
every life in America</i>

930
01:10:51,958 --> 01:10:53,625
<i>on your ability to retake the center?</i>

931
01:10:58,041 --> 01:10:58,916
I am.

932
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,875
<i>I'm sorry. I cannot endorse such a move.</i>

933
01:11:03,166 --> 01:11:07,041
Listen, genius. You're saying
my plan is running at 14%?

934
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:08,541
Yours is zero!

935
01:11:08,625 --> 01:11:12,375
You haven't been beat up, strangled,
or shot defending this rig today.

936
01:11:12,458 --> 01:11:15,333
So I think you'll find
I'm kind of fucking motivated here.

937
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:16,958
<i>We hear you, Captain.</i>

938
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:22,500
I can do this, sir. I know I can.

939
01:11:22,583 --> 01:11:24,416
<i>Half the people here think you're crazy.</i>

940
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,625
<i>The other half think you're a rock star.</i>

941
01:11:26,708 --> 01:11:29,166
<i>Fortunately, I'm one of the latter.</i>

942
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:31,083
<i>Do what you have to do, Captain.</i>

943
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:36,291
<i>Still there?</i>

944
01:11:37,375 --> 01:11:40,125
- What do you think?
<i>- I think you're getting nervous.</i>

945
01:11:40,208 --> 01:11:42,541
<i>If you fail here,
your partners will kill you.</i>

946
01:11:42,625 --> 01:11:44,541
<i>You want this room? Come and get it.</i>

947
01:11:45,041 --> 01:11:46,333
Intercom off.

948
01:11:49,208 --> 01:11:50,291
Give me the radio.

949
01:11:54,333 --> 01:11:55,708
Beaver, what's your ETA?

950
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:57,333
<i>About 30 seconds.</i>

951
01:11:57,875 --> 01:12:00,291
She's taped up the window.
I can't see in the room.

952
01:12:00,375 --> 01:12:02,083
I need you to get in there now.

953
01:12:02,166 --> 01:12:03,541
<i>Relax. I'm there.</i>

954
01:12:33,458 --> 01:12:36,416
I ain't see her. She gone.

955
01:12:36,916 --> 01:12:39,041
<i>What do you mean, gone?
Where is she?</i>

956
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:43,833
Shit.

957
01:12:43,916 --> 01:12:44,958
<i>What?</i>

958
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:46,125
She's on the roof.

959
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,083
Attention all missile teams,
we have control of the interceptor.

960
01:12:56,166 --> 01:13:00,125
Fire all missiles.
Repeat, fire all missiles.

961
01:13:12,666 --> 01:13:14,833
<i>Multiple missile launch detected.</i>

962
01:13:14,916 --> 01:13:16,666
<i>Multiple missile launch detected.</i>

963
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:20,333
Woo! Let's go, baby.
Light 'em up!

964
01:13:22,916 --> 01:13:26,291
<i>Targets acquired.
Targets acquired.</i>

965
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:30,750
<i>Seattle, San Francisco,
Las Vegas, Denver, St. Louis, Memphis,</i>

966
01:13:30,833 --> 01:13:33,291
<i>Chicago, Cincinnati,
Atlanta, Miami, Washington DC,</i>

967
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:35,750
<i>Boston, New York, Dallas, Philadelphia.</i>

968
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:36,750
Kill her.

969
01:13:42,041 --> 01:13:43,541
She come for me.

970
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:48,625
"Come make ten million," he says.

971
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:52,250
"Buy yourself a private island," he says.
"Piece of cake."

972
01:13:54,083 --> 01:13:55,541
Oh, man.

973
01:13:57,416 --> 01:13:58,583
Nope.

974
01:14:00,083 --> 01:14:01,250
Give me your knife.

975
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:03,375
Do it.

976
01:14:14,625 --> 01:14:15,583
Acid.

977
01:14:33,416 --> 01:14:35,958
Where are you, darlin'?

978
01:14:43,875 --> 01:14:46,500
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

979
01:14:47,708 --> 01:14:51,041
Apologies, ladies and gentlemen,
for that rude interruption,

980
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:52,625
but as you can see,

981
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:57,500
I have retaken this command center
and the nukes are on their way.

982
01:15:20,166 --> 01:15:22,416
Hey, the goalie ain't up here.

983
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,791
She has to be. Where else could she…

984
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:30,125
…be?

985
01:15:38,791 --> 01:15:40,666
She is on the roof, Beaver.

986
01:15:41,916 --> 01:15:43,333
There's no one down here.

987
01:16:15,375 --> 01:16:18,833
<i>Intercept launch expires
in eight minutes.</i>

988
01:16:36,583 --> 01:16:37,666
Ivan.

989
01:17:11,791 --> 01:17:15,083
<i>Intercept launch expires
in seven minutes.</i>

990
01:17:15,166 --> 01:17:16,291
Come on.

991
01:18:51,666 --> 01:18:53,708
Can't let you do that, darlin'.

992
01:19:00,375 --> 01:19:03,083
Let me go, Beaver. You don't want this.

993
01:19:03,166 --> 01:19:05,791
Hell, I told you what I wanted.

994
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:08,916
You're gonna die here.

995
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:10,958
No, I'm not.

996
01:19:11,458 --> 01:19:14,166
I'm on the next submarine out of here.

997
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:16,208
With Alexander?

998
01:19:16,958 --> 01:19:19,041
He's gone.

999
01:19:19,125 --> 01:19:20,750
Bullshit.

1000
01:19:23,791 --> 01:19:25,166
I saw him go.

1001
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,208
You can fight.

1002
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:47,333
<i>Intercept launch expires
in five minutes.</i>

1003
01:20:14,458 --> 01:20:18,125
Really think a little bit
of razor wire is gonna kill me?

1004
01:20:18,708 --> 01:20:20,916
Gravity, darlin'.

1005
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:57,125
<i>JJ… JJ, come on.</i>

1006
01:20:57,875 --> 01:21:00,791
What's the one thing
I've taught you since you were little?

1007
01:21:00,875 --> 01:21:02,875
The one rule in life?

1008
01:21:05,166 --> 01:21:06,916
Never stop fighting.

1009
01:21:25,916 --> 01:21:29,583
<i>Intercept launch expires

1010

<i>Intercept launch

1011
01:22:46,916 --> 01:22:48,041
There she is!

1012
01:22:48,125 --> 01:22:49,375
There she is!

1013
01:22:53,708 --> 01:22:55,583
Get up. Get up!

1014

<i>Intercept launch

Yeah! Woo-hoo!

1024
01:25:12,958 --> 01:25:15,333
Thank you. Thank you.

1025
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:20,750
Fourteen percent.

1026
01:25:21,958 --> 01:25:22,916
Huh.

1027
01:25:45,083 --> 01:25:46,166
Look at you.

1028
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,083
Still going, huh?

1029
01:25:50,416 --> 01:25:52,666
You know you really did fuck up my day.

1030
01:25:53,166 --> 01:25:55,125
But I brought America to the brink,

1031
01:25:56,291 --> 01:25:57,375
and I'll do it again.

1032
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:14,083
You may have won the battle,
but not the war.

1033
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:21,708
Told you. War's not over yet.

1034
01:26:30,416 --> 01:26:31,708
This is for my dad, asshole.

1035
01:26:41,125 --> 01:26:42,625
There's my ride.

1036
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:55,125
There's no room for you.

1037
01:26:58,541 --> 01:27:01,041
<i>I've arrived.
I can see him.</i>

1038
01:27:02,041 --> 01:27:04,500
<i>You know what to do.</i>

1039
01:27:04,583 --> 01:27:06,041
<i>What about the woman?</i>

1040
01:27:07,833 --> 01:27:10,000
<i>Your choice.</i>

1041
01:28:04,666 --> 01:28:07,208
<i>Target in sight.
We'll arrive in 30 seconds.</i>

1042
01:28:07,291 --> 01:28:10,000
<i>Contact. Russian submarine
looks like it's bugging out.</i>

1043
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:13,541
<i>We have visual on
Captain Collins on the roof.</i>

1044
01:28:35,916 --> 01:28:37,125
Madam President.

1045
01:28:37,666 --> 01:28:42,583
They told me you were awake.
It is good to see you, Captain.

1046
01:28:42,666 --> 01:28:43,541
Is Fort Greely...

1047
01:28:43,625 --> 01:28:46,291
Greely's back up.
Interceptors on standby.

1048
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:49,041
And we're going to replace
SBX-1 as soon as possible,

1049
01:28:49,125 --> 01:28:52,875
but don't worry, nobody is going
to send you back out there.

1050
01:28:52,958 --> 01:28:55,833
In fact, I think a soldier of your caliber

1051
01:28:55,916 --> 01:28:59,541
would be better put to use
on my National Security staff.

1052
01:28:59,625 --> 01:29:00,708
What do you say?

1053
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:04,333
I'll take that as a yes.

1054
01:29:05,208 --> 01:29:07,291
Thank you, Madam President.

1055
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:08,791
Oh, and you have another visitor.

1056
01:29:12,291 --> 01:29:14,125
- Papa?
- JJ.

1057
01:29:15,125 --> 01:29:16,833
I… I thought you were…

1058
01:29:18,583 --> 01:29:21,958
Turns out your dad has
some very well-armed Army buddies

1059
01:29:22,041 --> 01:29:24,333
watching over him in that retirement home.

1060
01:29:24,416 --> 01:29:26,041
They saw what was happening on TV.

1061
01:29:26,125 --> 01:29:27,708
Broke down my goddamn door.

1062
01:29:29,333 --> 01:29:31,541
Saved my finger. Lost my door.

1063
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:38,416
Well, I'll expect you to report to
the White House next week, Captain.

1064
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,708
Come here. Dad.

1065
01:29:45,208 --> 01:29:46,041
Hey.

1066
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:48,875
Oh. Uh…

1067
01:29:50,791 --> 01:29:51,833
This is for you.

1068
01:29:56,166 --> 01:29:57,375
Another survivor.

1069
01:29:58,750 --> 01:29:59,708
Turbo.

1070
01:29:59,791 --> 01:30:02,791
SEAL team found him
swimming around the wreckage of SBX-1.

1071
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:06,166
He belonged to Corporal Shah.

1072
01:30:06,666 --> 01:30:10,125
I heard what happened. I'm sorry.

1073
01:30:12,208 --> 01:30:14,250
You know, sometimes it's…

1074
01:30:14,333 --> 01:30:17,416
It's best to talk about
those we've lost so we don't forget.

1075
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:23,041
His name was Rahul.

1076
01:30:23,541 --> 01:30:24,791
Rahul?

1077
01:30:25,291 --> 01:30:26,250
He liked poker…

1078
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:27,791
I see.

1079
01:30:27,875 --> 01:30:29,833
…but he wasn't very good at it.

1079
01:30:30,305 --> 01:31:30,249
