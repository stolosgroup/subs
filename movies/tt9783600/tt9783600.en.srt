00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,125
Okay, Ray,

3
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:26,166
you are an incarcerated volunteer
in the Spider head clinical trial program.

4
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,208
Before we begin,
I need your permission to administer G-46.

5
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,208
- Drip on?
- Acknowledge.

6
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,958
What was the ghost's favorite fruit?

7
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:42,916
Boo-berry.

8
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,583
No shit, that's funny.

9
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,708
What did the magician say
to the fisherman?

10
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,291
Pick a cod, any cod.

11
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:13,083
What do you call
cheese that isn't yours?

12
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:18,000
Nacho cheese.

13
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:26,291
All right, Ray, Ray, these next ones
aren't jokes, more just facts, okay?

14
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:27,375
Oh, yeah?

15
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:39,958
In the 1994 genocide in Rwanda,
over 800,000 people died.

16
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,791
You are serving…

17
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:53,666
You're serving
four consecutive life sentences

18
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,208
without the possibility of parole.

19
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,958
Ray, thank you.
You're free to cruise, buddy.

20
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,750
<i>Another beautiful morning, friends,</i>

21
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,541
<i>time to rise and really shine.</i>

22
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,791
<i>As volunteers in the Spider head
Penitentiary and Research Center…</i>

23
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,208
<i>…you must do your part
and practice the golden rules,</i>

24
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:55,041
<i>no abuse, physical, verbal, or otherwise
and label your food in the fridge.</i>

25
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,000
<i>Jeff, please report to the dock
for remote field testing.</i>

26
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,083
Okay, Jeff, we have
a new compound for you today.

27
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,208
- Drip on?
- If it's N-31.

28
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,375
Hilarious, N-40. Acknowledge?

29
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,250
Acknowledge.

30
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,875
Yeah, whenever you're ready, Jeff.

31
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,166
It's really nice.

32
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,416
Oh, boy. Okay if we pep up
your language centers, Jeff?

33
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,333
Drip on?

34
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,041
- Sure.
- Acknowledge?

35
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,791
Oh, sorry. Yeah, acknowledge.

36
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:04,625
Whoa.

37
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,708
Hey, sorry, I'm late.

38
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,166
Party's here.

39
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,833
Such a creep.

40
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,500
- Where you been?
- Field trip.

41
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,250
Oh, right, your phone call with Emma.

42
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,916
No, uh, drug study.

43
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,541
<i>N-40, I think.</i>

44
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,958
<i>They have everyone
on these field trips but me.</i>

45
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:35,958
You're still new.

46
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:39,833
I'm not that new.
You know, I'd love some sunshine.

47
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,166
Can I help you with the…

48
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,333
Nectarines and prosciutto?

49
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,791
What you gonna help with?
I'm done. You're late.

50
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:47,916
Open up.

51
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Enjoy that. Get it all.

52
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,458
- Yeah.
- It's really good.

53
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,875
- Good, right?
- I hope they keep you on snack.

54
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,583
I always said they wasted
your talents on janitorial.

55
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,500
Don't be too sure about that.
I've got a bit of a scrub fetish.

56
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,875
- Okay.
- Hey…

57
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:07,083
- Did you notice we kinda...
- Finish each other's sentences?

58
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,541
I was gonna say, need new bowls.

59
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,083
Uh…

60
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,000
So, how was the N-40?

61
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,458
{\an8}<i>Flowers didn't grow…</i>

62
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:30,916
They were sculpted. Painted.

63
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:39,000
I mean, I would tell you about it,
but I'm just coming down off the...

64
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,500
- Verbaluce.
- Yeah.

65
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:44,208
That tip-of-the-tongue feeling
when you can't find the right word

66
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,125
and you feel like
you'll never find the right word again?

67
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,208
Yeah.

68
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,416
Well, you're cute when you're stupid.

69
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,875
Okay, but it sucks
because today was the day that…

70
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,208
There was something that
I was gonna tell you today, Lizzy.

71
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,625
Okay, well, we got time.

72
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,291
Yes, we do.

73
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,875
All we've got is time.

74
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,458
Okay.

75
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,958
What you know about this?

76
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,458
You know nothing about this.

77
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,166
So, to sum up…

78
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:36,833
I love it.

79
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,541
It's beautiful.

80
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,708
- Where do you wanna take me?
<i>- Hmm.</i>

81
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:34,000
What about that island, you know,
the one where they make water?

82
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,000
Fiji?

83
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,083
Fiji.

84
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,500
- I'll take you to Fiji.
- Thank you.

85
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,000
Just need a little money.

86
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,803
Can we go to Mark's?
For his birthday?

87
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:48,458
It was Tuesday, but he's
a celebrate-all-week motherfucker. Please?

88
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:49,581
Gotta ask the boss.

89
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,833
<i>You two go have fun.
I'm gonna stay here. Okay?</i>

90
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,875
- Miss you.
- Miss you more.

91
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:01,833
You cool to drive?

92
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:04,958
Ice cold.

93
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Whoo!

94
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,708
Oh, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff!

95
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,750
Jeff!

96
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,458
Sorry, I'm late, Mr. Abnesti.

97
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,750
I'm gonna retire
the day you call me Steve.

98
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,125
Not late at all.

99
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,250
Heather, on the other hand…

100
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,416
Yeah, speak of the devil.

101
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,500
Sorry.

102
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:02,958
All right.

103
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,791
Oh, how rude of me.
Jeff, Heather. Heather, Jeff.

104
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:13,041
For the record, either prior to or during
your incarceration here at Spider head,

105
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,500
have you two ever spoken?

106
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,250
- No.
- No.

107
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,250
Ever interacted in any way?

108
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,291
Did I not just say no?

109
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,375
No.

110
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,291
So, what do you think?

111
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,750
Who are you asking?

112
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,833
I'm asking both of you.
Let's start with Jeff.

113
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,791
Yeah, she seems nice.

114
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,541
You like that word, but no,
I mean, how attractive is she?

115
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,500
What, Steve,
you can't see it for yourself?

116
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,125
Can you shut up, please?
I'm asking Jeff. How's she looking?

117
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,833
Come on, man.

118
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,958
- A scale of one to ten?
- Um…

119
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,333
Yeah, she's a seven and a half.

120
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,666
And, Heather?

121
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:02,416
He's all right. A five on a good day.

122
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,666
Did you give her Honest-Ease?

123
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,708
No, I would have to ask. You know.

124
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,416
I'm just kind of a bitch.

125
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Oh.

126
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,875
Well, then I would like
to change my vote to an eight.

127
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,583
All right, uh, Jeff, Heather,

128
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,583
can I have your permission
to administer N-40? Drip on?

129
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,333
Acknowledge.

130
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,291
- Uh, yeah.
- Heather?

131
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,833
God, she's a pain in the ass.

132
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,375
- Acknowledge.
- Thank you.

133
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,583
Come on, guys.
Words, words, words.

134
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,541
Okay, yeah,
she's starting to look pretty good.

135
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,458
Oh, my…

136
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:58,000
Yeah, she's…
She's looking really, really good.

137
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,333
Heather?

138
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,541
Uh, same. Yeah.

139
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,750
Okay, pump up the Verbaluce,
let's get 'em talking.

140
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,958
Oh, God, she's so beautiful.

141
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,083
Yeah, don't tell us, tell each other.

142
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,000
You're… Oh, my God.

143
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,875
You're stunning,
you're gorgeous.

144
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,708
{\an8}Sorry, I didn't see it before.

145
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:36,833
{\an8}It's okay, you're the most beautiful woman
I think I've ever seen in my life.

146
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:37,958
Thank you.

147
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,041
Wow.

148
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,333
- Yeah.
- I could, uh…

149
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,666
- Yeah?
- I could…

150
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,958
You could what, Jeff?

151
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,083
Oh, yeah.

152
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,291
Are we getting this?

153
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,458
Oh, yeah.

154
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,083
Oh, my God.

155
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:27,916
You okay?

156
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,583
Oh.

157
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,833
What's so funny?

158
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:40,916
Nothing.

159
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,125
I didn't think it was possible.

160
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,583
What?

161
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,541
I'm liking cuddling.

162
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,791
Please send me home
with some of this shit.

163
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:03,875
Heather…

164
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:06,875
Yes?

165
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:12,916
I love you.

166
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,916
Holy shit.

167
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,041
I love you too.

168
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,791
N-fucking-40, baby.

169
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,666
Yeah, God damn, we're good.

170
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,833
The love drug.

171
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:25,750
Gold star?

172
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,791
Not yet, not yet. No, no.

173
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,833
We're less interested in
what we just saw than the residual effect.

174
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:34,333
I realize you're stretched thin,
but I need you to observe these two.

175
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,708
After they come down, in the next hours,
days, do they seek contact?

176
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,916
Profess feelings when
they're in the same room?

177
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,875
Do they communicate non-verbally?
Look for isopraxisms.

178
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,500
Uh, mirrored behaviors.

179
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,000
People in love
unconsciously mimic each other's actions.

180
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,333
They scratch their faces,
fiddle with their hair at the same time.

181
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,291
It's like their bodies
can't help themselves.

182
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,041
So watch Jeff and Heather.

183
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,750
I want to know. I want to know, does love…

184
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,875
Does this love last?

185
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,958
Hey, guys, thank you.

186
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,583
Thank you very much, no kidding.
We couldn't do it without you.

187
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,208
Remember, what you're feeling,

188
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,958
the sometimes
disquieting transitions are natural.

189
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,500
We're bringing you back
to baseline. More to come.

190
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,375
Am I back on snack?

191
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,375
You don't wanna know, trust me.

192
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,083
Me and the girls at the group home,

193
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,666
we swiped lottery tickets
from convenience stores,

194
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,500
scratched them a hundred at a time.

195
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:32,208
It looked like we were doing honest work,
you know, dirt under our nails.

196
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:36,458
It's not like we thought
stealing was bad, right?

197
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,875
No one needed it more than us
'cause we had nothin'.

198
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,083
Yeah.

199
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:43,625
This one Christmas Eve,
we're drivin' through neighborhoods,

200
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:44,958
everyone's at church.

201
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,250
We're breaking windows,

202
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,000
stealing presents from
under people's Christmas trees…

203
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,083
Here you go.

204
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,958
Know what happens the next morning?

205
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:56,250
We're openin' up other people's sweaters,
<i>The Grinch</i> comes on TV.

206
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,208
Man.

207
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,625
That part where
he gives back all the presents?

208
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,125
- I felt so bad.
- Yeah, I bet.

209
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,000
I cried like a little punk-ass.

210
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,583
Afternoon, kids.

211
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,291
Sarah, you know Jeff.
Jeff, you know Sarah.

212
00:18:58,916 --> 00:18:59,916
Hey.

213
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Hey.

214
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,130
As you know,
we're wall-to-wall today.

215
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,916
Boss man's breathing down our neck.

216
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,625
- So, if it's cool...
- Acknowledge.

217
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,708
Yeah, fine. Acknowledge.

218
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,833
I can't watch.

219
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,625
Sarah or the double dose?

220
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,000
Sarah <i>on</i> the double dose.

221
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,375
We're all here by choice, Mark.

222
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,041
Is she…

223
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:47,833
Yeah, I think so.

224
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,958
Yes! Yes!

225
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,208
What's up, Ray?

226
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,416
Someone wrote in shit
on the bathroom stall doors, that's what.

227
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Gross.

228
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,916
I'll find out who's shit-finger.
Hope it ain't you.

229
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,500
It's not.

230
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,416
Damn, I will never be as good
at anything as you are with that.

231
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,583
- You like that?
- Yeah.

232
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,708
Hey, is there a drug
to make you forget shit?

233
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,083
Yeah, it's called old age.

234
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,416
I'm looking forward to it.

235
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,041
How you feeling?

236
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,500
I'm all right. A little sore.

237
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,458
It must've felt pretty good
at the time though.

238
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,250
Yeah.

239
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,250
We can get you some cream for that.

240
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,791
I'm fine. Thanks, though.

241
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,916
Hey, uh, do me a favor.

242
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:08,375
While we're at it, try not to let
the girls touch your MobiPak.

243
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,541
And don't… And don't touch theirs. Okay?

244
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,958
I know it gets crazy in there,
but they're not made for jostling,

245
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,208
they can flood.

246
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,625
You could lose control.

247
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,333
Cool.

248
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,583
Uh, hey, Mark?

249
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:24,875
Yeah?

250
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,416
Can you take me off snack?

251
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:30,458
Was something wrong? Problems with Lizzy?

252
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,916
Nah, just, I'm ready for a change.

253
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,000
Yeah. Okay.

254
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,291
Thanks, man.

255
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,666
God damn it.

256
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,583
Oh, my God.

257
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:02,541
Lizzy.

258
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:03,791
Is she from Seattle?

259
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,958
Prescott, Arizona.

260
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,625
Ah, see? Jeff knows.

261
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,541
It's cool when folks get acquainted.

262
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,750
Speaking of,
I saw the box scores this morning.

263
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:16,166
You Mariners are on a bit of a streak.
We should pipe in a game later, huh?

264
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,375
Yeah, that'd be great.
Who're they playing?

265
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,625
Crap. Hey, Mark, return this.

266
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,541
Uh, Jeff, please take a seat.
Another full day ahead.

267
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,500
If you could read the headlines,
you can't, but if you could,

268
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,583
the world needs our help more than ever.

269
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,208
Now, we got two rooms running today.

270
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:35,125
Pay no attention to Dave, trust me.

271
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,583
Seriously, trust him.

272
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,375
Jeff…

273
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,708
All right. Recognize them?

274
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,416
That's very funny.

275
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,958
I'm gonna present you with a choice.
This is what I'm after.

276
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,583
- Mm-hmm.
- You see this remote?

277
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:59,000
Let's say, you can slide this button
and Sarah gets some Darkenfloxx,

278
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:03,125
or you could slide this button
and Heather gets some Darkenfloxx.

279
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:04,208
You see? You choose.

280
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:07,833
They have Darkenfloxx in their MobiPaks?

281
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:08,916
Excuse me.

282
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:13,750
Hey, Dave, how you feeling?

283
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,083
Hungry.

284
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,125
- Could he be shit-finger?
- Yeah, maybe.

285
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:27,625
All that food's
gotta go somewhere.

286
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,541
Where were we? Darkenfloxx.

287
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:33,208
Mark put it in the ladies' MobiPaks
in anticipation of this very study.

288
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,458
That make you feel uncomfortable?

289
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,416
A little.

290
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,041
Yeah? That's okay, it should.

291
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:43,166
But you know as well as I
it's just an agitator,

292
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,166
causes no permanent damage. All right?

293
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:48,458
So what's your decision, Jeff?

294
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:51,083
Is Heather getting
the Darkenfloxx or is Sarah?

295
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,583
I don't know, I can't say.

296
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:58,041
Can't say or won't say?
You kinda have to, you know that.

297
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:02,083
I mean, it's random if I do.

298
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,125
You feel your decision would be random?

299
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:05,208
Yeah.

300
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,791
This is what we're testing for…

301
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,500
Is any residual fondness with…
With the ladies.

302
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,875
So why don't you tell me
how you feel about Heather and Sarah?

303
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,875
How I feel?

304
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:18,041
Maybe some Verbaluce?

305
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,125
No.

306
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:24,458
I mean, it's not that I like 'em both,
or that I like one more than the other.

307
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:29,666
It's just, I… I just don't really feel
anything towards either of them, you know?

308
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,750
I mean, I can remember feeling
a certain way towards 'em,

309
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:36,625
but that's all kind of
hazy and worn off now.

310
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:40,708
And why such reluctance
to the Darkenfloxx then?

311
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:42,916
Because I was a part of I-16.

312
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:48,875
I mean, I know what it's like,
and you know what it's like.

313
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:50,125
- It's…
- Yeah.

314
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:51,375
It's… It's horrible.

315
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:55,041
And I just…
I don't want to do that to anyone.

316
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:58,291
Look, I don't know. It's random.

317
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,750
Okay. I'll tell you what.

318
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:07,541
I'm giving
the Darkenfloxx to Heather. Okay?

319
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:13,833
Actually, I'm gonna give it to Sarah.

320
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:20,416
All right, Jeff, you've convinced me.

321
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:23,291
It would to you be random,
you truly have no preference.

322
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:25,875
My preference is that nobody gets it.

323
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,083
That makes two of us.

324
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:28,166
Three.

325
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:30,041
See what we just did.

326
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:33,083
With your help, we learned
a lot more about N-40.

327
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:35,583
"Luvactin," working title.

328
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:38,083
So, no one's getting Darkenfloxx?

329
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:39,166
Not today.

330
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:41,541
But we do need
to understand N-40 a bit better.

331
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,333
For instance, uh,
what's the drug's duration?

332
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:46,625
What's the variable effect
of its dosage?

333
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:49,458
You and Sarah were on double the dose
of you and Heather

334
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:52,333
and yet your feelings for the two women
are largely the same.

335
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:54,041
Don't you find that interesting?

336
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:56,166
Yeah.

337
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:02,208
Hey, uh, I, uh… I'm not one to bring
Darkenfloxx in any conversation,

338
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:06,583
but we have to know more about N-40.
It could be a game-changer, Jeff.

339
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:09,416
The work we do
could help millions of people.

340
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:12,083
You ever loved?

341
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:16,416
Yeah.

342
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:19,875
Yeah, you were lucky. Not everyone can.

343
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:25,125
You know that loneliness is as lethal
as smoking 15 cigarettes a day?

344
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:26,833
Look it up.

345
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:30,791
Imagine if we could destroy
all the world's cigarettes.

346
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:35,541
We'd have people everywhere loving,
being loved, capable of love,

347
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:38,708
and who would've made that possible?

348
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:40,875
- Gold star for me.
- Yeah.

349
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:43,500
Yeah. And your new friend, N-40.
Yay for us.

350
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:44,791
Yay.

351
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:49,083
Okay. Thank you, ladies.

352
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:52,625
Excuse you, Jeff.

353
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,041
Hey. Everything okay?

354
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:03,583
Yeah.

355
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,875
They don't know how close
they came to getting Darkenfloxxed.

356
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,500
Yeah, I know. I get it.

357
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,666
But listen, man, think if you'd had
the benefit of one of our products

358
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,166
before your fateful night…

359
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,791
What is it you want, Jeff,
more than anything in the world?

360
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:24,333
To go back.

361
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,833
<i>What you want is redemption.</i>

362
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:53,750
And this is how you're gonna find it.

363
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,750
Yeah, thanks.

364
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:23,541
Hey.

365
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:25,166
Hey.

366
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:26,875
Meatball?

367
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,291
Yeah, sure.

368
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:33,291
Ah, sorry.

369
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:37,833
It's all right.
I suck at this game anyway.

370
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:44,083
- Hey, I wanted to...
- Hey, Jeff.

371
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:51,166
Ah, Free Fridays.

372
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:52,958
Lucky.

373
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:56,208
Say hi to the missus for me.

374
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:24,375
<i>Hi, it's Emma.
Leave a message or don't.</i>

375
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:29,583
<i>Hey, babe, you're probably getting
sick of me leaving these things for you,</i>

376
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:35,500
<i>but I just wanted to tell you
the usual that I miss you and I'm sorry.</i>

377
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:39,833
<i>Something else I wanna tell you too.</i>

378
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:44,083
<i>I, uh, met someone.
Yeah, her name's Lizzy.</i>

379
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:46,875
<i>She kinda reminds me of you a little bit.</i>

380
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:52,208
<i>So maybe I'll finally stop bugging you.</i>

381
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,208
<i>This'll be my last, "I'm sorry."</i>

382
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,500
Yeah, come in.

383
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:28,041
Ho, ho, ho!

384
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:31,500
Merry Christmas, Lizzy.

385
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:34,041
- Have you been a nice girl?
- This is…

386
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,916
This is Santa?

387
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,500
Hello!

388
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:40,291
Thought this might cheer us up.

389
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:41,666
{\an8}Aww. Wow.

390
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,833
{\an8}- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

391
00:30:43,916 --> 00:30:46,041
Ew! Ugh!

392
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:47,125
God.

393
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:50,166
It's not actually Christmas though, is it?

394
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:51,916
October?

395
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,916
- Yeah, just a guess.
- Okay.

396
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:57,125
I'd play "Jingle Bells,"
but we get this instead.

397
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:59,166
You know what? I'll make some eggnog.

398
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,125
- Mm.
- Yeah?

399
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:03,666
- Ooh, Santa like eggnog.
- Not the Santa voice.

400
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,750
Hey, Rogan.

401
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:19,458
Go fuck yourself.

402
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:40,125
No, no, no, no, no, no.

403
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:42,375
- No way, guys. Come on.
- Just relax.

404
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:45,958
We know what it does. Okay?
We've all seen what it does.

405
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:48,750
It's already proven.
This isn't some type of skin show.

406
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:49,833
Tell 'em, Rogan.

407
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:53,333
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
But fuck all y'all.

408
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:56,750
- He has a future in greeting cards.
- I can fuckin' hear you!

409
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:59,166
Guys, listen, listen to me, okay?

410
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,000
I've never been with a… Uh…

411
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:03,583
No offense, man. If you have, that's fine.

412
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:05,083
It's not my thing. Whatever.

413
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:07,958
Look, Mark, I'm not recovered, man.

414
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:11,000
I asked for cream,
nobody brought me cream.

415
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:12,875
So I'm not doing this. I won't.

416
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:15,916
No, I'm not. No! No! No! No!

417
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,333
I'm not, I won't. I won't acknowledge.

418
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:22,333
Jeff, chill pill. It isn't what
you think. No romance novels today.

419
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:23,416
Huh.

420
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:25,708
Your loss.

421
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Funny.

422
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:40,583
That's it, guys. Thanks.

423
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:44,541
What the fuck was that about?

424
00:32:58,208 --> 00:33:00,666
<i>Ping-pong
tournament set for Saturday.</i>

425
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,583
<i>Please see Ray if you're interested.</i>

426
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,541
- Oh, hi, Jeff.
- Hey, Heather.

427
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:05,541
It's not the time.

428
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:09,250
Did Mr. Abnesti ask you
who to Darkenfloxx, me or Rogan?

429
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:11,708
- He did present me with that dilemma...
- Heather.

430
00:33:11,791 --> 00:33:14,458
Did you recently have sex
with Rogan in addition to me

431
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:16,875
and fall in love with him
like you did with me?

432
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:17,791
Jeff, come on.

433
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,833
That's an accurate assessment
of what's going on.

434
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:21,875
- Heather, put a sock in it.
- Okay.

435
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,291
Jeff, what are you doing?

436
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:26,666
Now she's looking for her sock.
You get very literal on Verbaluce.

437
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,416
Yes, I'm aware. Thank you.
Show yourself out, close the door.

438
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,625
- Okay.
- Well done.

439
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,958
Please show yourself out, thank you.

440
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,833
- Jesus Christ, Jeff. It's...
- Wow. Yeah.

441
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,083
What's going on, huh?

442
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:43,958
- So everybody's just fucking everyone?
- Language.

443
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:45,250
Everyone's fucking everyone.

444
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,583
- Relax.
- And being asked to Darkenfloxx everyone.

445
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:48,875
It's experimental design.

446
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:51,416
I don't make the rules,
it's the Protocol Committee.

447
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,791
Why don't you take a look? Look. Here.

448
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,416
Here you go. Huh?

449
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,041
{\an8}You think I want to do this?

450
00:33:58,125 --> 00:33:59,333
{\an8}Let me close the door.

451
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:01,875
Mark, I mean, look, man,

452
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,791
I've been on
some crazy-ass project teams, right?

453
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:07,666
But this one…
Yeah, this one doesn't feel right.

454
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:10,916
Jeff, you know,
I sympathize, but only to a point.

455
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,125
I gotta take off my friendship hat
for a second and remind you,

456
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:15,958
your presence in this facility,

457
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:19,375
while technically a punishment,
is a privilege. Is it not?

458
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:21,666
You applied for it,
you were approved for it.

459
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,958
You could as easily be
at State with the general pop

460
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:25,791
and you would be playing pitch-and-catch,

461
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:27,666
in your case catch,
with the likes of Rogan.

462
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,875
You don't wanna know
what he did in his last prison.

463
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:32,916
And secondly,
our open-door policy is my greatest pride.

464
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,958
I can come visit you, you can visit me.

465
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:37,458
Even in my quarters
or up here in the Spider head.

466
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:41,208
No other penal institution in the world
boasts such a respectful relationship

467
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:42,958
between the jailer and the jailed.

468
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:48,083
No bars, no guards, that's only possible
in a culture of mutual respect.

469
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:51,500
Okay? Mutual respect.
I don't burst in on you, do I?

470
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:52,583
Huh?

471
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,916
- No.
- No.

472
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,833
So, you don't burst in on me.
We must honor that or it's my ass.

473
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:00,583
Doors close, locks go on,

474
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:03,166
suddenly we're no different
from anywhere else, you get it?

475
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,250
Yes.

476
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:06,875
Jesus, is it all that terrible here?

477
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:10,666
Huh? I'm asking
'cause I've taken great pains, Jeff.

478
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,666
It's very nice.

479
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,333
The food, the ping-pong, arcade games,

480
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:16,958
freedom within reason
to move around as you please.

481
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:18,541
I've insisted on that for you.

482
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:20,916
I've flirted with violating
state compliance standards,

483
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,625
- at no small risk to me.
- I know.

484
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:24,333
In front of my bosses, my boss' bosses.

485
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:25,875
Back me up here, Mark.

486
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,958
- Hmm? Come on, say something.
- He's right.

487
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:34,916
At least you could
return the sentiment.

488
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,166
It's the least you could do.

489
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:40,625
I'm sorry.

490
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:43,791
Okay? I…

491
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:48,625
It's just, all this talk of Darkenfloxx,
it gets me on edge. Okay?

492
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:53,083
I hate this, Jeff and I'm sorry. Okay?

493
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:54,166
I just…

494
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:58,208
I need to know if we can count on you.

495
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:01,333
Can we count on you in the future
to honor our arrangement?

496
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:13,916
Hey, Sarah.

497
00:36:19,416 --> 00:36:22,791
This time, next week, we'll have
our last gold star, don't you think?

498
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:27,041
Mark, smile once in a while, okay?
We're changing the world.

499
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:28,541
Yeah.

500
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,166
Not you too.

501
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:34,333
Listen, Darkenfloxx is a tool, okay?

502
00:36:34,416 --> 00:36:36,875
It's gonna help us figure out
the important shit.

503
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:40,000
This time, next week,
right back in the drawer, I promise.

504
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:42,416
Yeah? What?

505
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:47,708
Well, just something Jeff said
about wanting a drug to forget.

506
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:49,375
You need to relax, okay?

507
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,166
Enjoy your weekend, Mark.

508
00:36:52,791 --> 00:36:54,541
Hit the mainland, clear your head.

509
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:56,291
You need it. We both do.

510
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:59,208
Maybe wings, beer, Skee-Ball,
whatever you kids are into?

511
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:02,000
Yeah, um… Oh, I think Skee-Ball.

512
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:03,541
Okay.

513
00:37:07,666 --> 00:37:08,666
Bye, Mark.

514
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,250
Holy fucking shit.

515
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:38,166
I mean, it's hard to describe
without Verbaluce,

516
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:44,041
but just imagine
the worst you've ever felt times ten,

517
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:48,250
and even that doesn't even
come close to it, honestly, I mean…

518
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,041
I felt like I was on fire.

519
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:55,416
I wished I was on fire.

520
00:38:57,375 --> 00:39:01,166
I would have set myself on fire
to make it stop. It's horrible.

521
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,375
So they give this Darkenfloxx to someone?

522
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:05,958
I mean, not this time.

523
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:07,458
Well, that's good.

524
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:10,583
Jesus, you're shaking.

525
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:18,041
You're a good guy.

526
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:31,416
Look, I heard from Mark
that you asked to be taken off snack.

527
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:35,708
I assume that meant away from me, right?

528
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,375
It's 'cause of, uh…

529
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:39,958
Emma?

530
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:41,458
Yeah.

531
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:43,291
No, she's…

532
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:46,500
She's moved on.

533
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:51,583
It just helps to hear her voice sometimes.

534
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:55,541
Yeah, I know.
Of course, I get it, you know.

535
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:01,791
This place can really mess with your head.

536
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:09,166
I mean, they've been testing me up
and down a lot weirder stuff than usual.

537
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:13,625
It's just been really tough lately.

538
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:21,041
Sometimes, it's hard to remember
who I was before I came in here.

539
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:27,583
But, Lizzy…

540
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:32,250
When I'm with you…

541
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:37,083
That's the only time
I really feel like myself.

542
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:48,666
Hands up, Mark. Come on.
There you go.

543
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:51,500
So, I had a big idea for G-46.

544
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,000
Oh, yeah? What, Laffodil?

545
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,250
Yes, uh, we sell it to comedy clubs.

546
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:59,208
That's a little idea, Mark. No offense.

547
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,875
Offense kind of taken.

548
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,416
Whoo-hoo!

549
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:05,750
What do I keep saying to you, huh?

550
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:07,125
I don't know, "Shut up, Mark"?

551
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:09,166
I say you gotta think huge.

552
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,041
You look at the world through
the wrong end of binoculars.

553
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:14,208
That's weird. Don't be weird.

554
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,708
Hey, uh, what time do we start?

555
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:17,791
Ten minutes.

556
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:20,875
Why don't you hit me? We got time.

557
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:23,833
Come on, hit me. Let's go.

558
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:29,500
- Two?
- Uh, make it three.

559
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,041
Remember, at least 12 hours apart.

560
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:36,125
Yeah, I've heard the dosing schedule.
Thank you.

561
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:41,333
Say it. Come on,
you've been wanting to for a while.

562
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,416
Best shot.

563
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:44,958
You of all people...

564
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:46,625
Should understand the risks?

565
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:48,000
That's what I'm trying to do.

566
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:50,708
- We can assess risks without taking them.
- Oh, can I?

567
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:52,791
Someone has to answer
for our products, Mark.

568
00:41:52,875 --> 00:41:54,208
Doesn't that occur to you?

569
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:57,291
Life out there is not life in here, okay?
Shit is messy.

570
00:41:57,375 --> 00:42:00,375
It's out of our control.
This is new frontier stuff here.

571
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:04,625
And when, not if, when one of
our compounds falls on its face,

572
00:42:04,708 --> 00:42:07,458
one of us has to stand
in front of a bereaved loved one,

573
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:10,666
or Mike Wallace, or God forbid, a jury,
and answer for what we do.

574
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:13,083
What we made and bottled
and named and sold.

575
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:14,250
Is that gonna be you?

576
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:15,958
No, it's gonna be the guy who can say,

577
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:18,750
"You're right I stand behind our shit.
I've taken it myself."

578
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:22,166
Mike Wallace is dead.

579
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,666
Really? Hard to keep track.
Ed Bradley then.

580
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,750
Also dead.

581
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,291
Morley Safer?

582
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,708
Shit. Better to think someone's dead,
and find out they're alive.

583
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:35,541
Yeah, when you first hired me...

584
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:37,583
Yeah, you disapproved. Duly noted.

585
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:40,541
Hey, Jeff, how are you?

586
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:43,166
- Hey.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to…

587
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,166
That's cool.
Maybe a bit of advance notice next time.

588
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,250
Sure.

589
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:48,916
Yeah, shall we?

590
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,250
Nobel Prize ain't gonna
win itself.

591
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:53,041
Mark?

592
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:55,333
I'm gonna freshen up,
so be down in a second.

593
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:04,833
Shit.

594
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,916
- Is Heather…
- On her way.

595
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:15,625
Beautiful people get away with too much.

596
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:18,375
I say that having
benefited myself from time to time.

597
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:24,125
Heather, thanks for joining us.
Be right with you.

598
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:29,583
All right, uh, Jeff,
I want to start by apologizing.

599
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:32,041
No, look,
I shouldn't have walked in on you.

600
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:33,458
Oh. No, not that. Uh…

601
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,958
Remember the other day when I asked you

602
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:38,375
which girl to give the Darkenfloxx to
and you said neither?

603
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:40,250
Yeah.

604
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:43,750
That was good enough for me,
but apparently not the Protocol Committee.

605
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:45,875
- Mm-hmm.
- Three Horsemen of Anality.

606
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:48,250
They're not convinced
you don't have residual feelings

607
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:49,750
for Heather and Sarah.

608
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:54,125
So, unfortunately today we gotta do
a kind of a confirmation trial.

609
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:56,625
This time per
the Protocol Committee, Mark,

610
00:43:56,708 --> 00:43:59,916
uh, instead of me asking you
which girl to give the Darkenfloxx to,

611
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,375
which the Protcom felt was,
they say, "too subjective,"

612
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:08,083
we're gonna give the girl
the Darkenfloxx and then see what you say.

613
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:10,125
Once again on some Verbaluce.

614
00:44:10,666 --> 00:44:12,666
You refreshed his MobiPak?
His quantities good?

615
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:16,041
They are. Plus
I already told you they are.

616
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:17,375
And what about Heather's?

617
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:19,833
You stood right there
and watched me, Steve.

618
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,708
That I did, Mark.

619
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:27,125
Sorry, Jeff, we're a little tense today.

620
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:31,291
Not an easy day and everyone's
a little bit uncomfortable about this.

621
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:33,416
I don't want you to Darkenfloxx Heather.

622
00:44:33,958 --> 00:44:34,833
Okay, good start.

623
00:44:34,916 --> 00:44:39,125
Uh, is that because you love her?
Feelings of love?

624
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:41,208
No, I mean, I already told you that.

625
00:44:41,291 --> 00:44:42,458
Yeah, uh, and I agreed,

626
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:46,166
but is this confirmation trial
about what you and I want?

627
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,083
Not so much.

628
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:50,333
What it is about
is about us recording what you say

629
00:44:50,416 --> 00:44:52,458
as you observe
Heather getting Darkenfloxxed

630
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:53,791
for five minutes, that's all.

631
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:55,666
One five-minute trial. Okay?

632
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:58,541
So, here we go with the Verbaluce.

633
00:44:58,625 --> 00:45:00,083
Drip on, Jeff?

634
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:04,416
Oh, come on, Jeff.

635
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,416
You should be flattered.
Did we choose Rogan?

636
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:08,333
You're afraid of Rogan.

637
00:45:08,416 --> 00:45:11,083
Yeah, Rogan could kill you
with a box of Kleenex.

638
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:15,500
But no, we deemed your level of speaking
more commensurate with our data needs.

639
00:45:15,583 --> 00:45:16,583
Drip on?

640
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:23,083
God, did you even know Heather's story?

641
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:24,666
You don't. Legally, you can't.

642
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,958
But does it involve whiskey,
gangs, patricide? I can't say.

643
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:31,958
But can I imply that her past
did not exactly include a dog named Lassie

644
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:35,041
and a lot of family talks about the Bible
while grammy sat doing macramé?

645
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:37,583
Can I suggest if… Mark, empty.

646
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,458
Can I suggest if you knew Heather's past,

647
00:45:40,541 --> 00:45:44,583
making her feel briefly sad,
nauseous, and/or horrified,

648
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:47,166
it might not seem like
the worst idea in the world?

649
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:50,666
I don't know.

650
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:53,208
Am I a monster, Jeff?

651
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:55,666
Do I remember birthdays around here?

652
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,666
Who took you up
in his seaplane that one time?

653
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,125
- You.
- Yeah. And when we had

654
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:02,291
that outbreak of athlete's foot,
and your feet were rashed up,

655
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:05,000
did a certain individual
rush to pick up a prescription,

656
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:07,583
paying for it with his own personal money?

657
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:09,000
- That was nice.
- Yeah.

658
00:46:09,083 --> 00:46:10,958
Seems unprofessional to bring up now.

659
00:46:11,041 --> 00:46:13,375
Come on, Jeff,
what do you want me to say here?

660
00:46:13,458 --> 00:46:15,541
Huh? Your Free Fridays are at risk?

661
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:18,125
Look,
I'm trying to help, Mr. Abnesti.

662
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,208
Steve!

663
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:26,458
Can you make a call for me?

664
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,333
Yeah, all right.

665
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:41,000
Let me give it a shot. Okay? BRB.

666
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:50,916
Lizzy.

667
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,166
Uh, Mr. Abnesti.

668
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,208
- My father in the room?
- Huh?

669
00:46:54,291 --> 00:46:56,333
Who am I kidding?
He split when I was eight.

670
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:59,041
Shit, man. I'm sorry.

671
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:01,291
We're so happy to have you, Lizzy,

672
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:04,416
and not just 'cause of
your culinary skills.

673
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,541
You won best brisket
at the Prescott Barbecue Festival,

674
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:09,625
three years running?

675
00:47:09,708 --> 00:47:10,833
How did you know that?

676
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:12,750
- It's my business to know.
- Wow.

677
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:14,208
You know, myself,

678
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:16,791
- I find brisket a little bit fibrous, but…
- Hmm.

679
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:19,125
Okay.

680
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:22,708
Did we snag you
those copper pots you're after?

681
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:25,541
I've been meaning to thank you.

682
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:27,583
Stop it, stop it, unnecessary.

683
00:47:27,666 --> 00:47:29,666
You've been such a welcome addition.

684
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,750
- It's the least I could do.
- Thank you.

685
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:34,166
Mm.

686
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:37,291
In fact, you know, you made me feel, uh…

687
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:40,125
Made me feel a little bit foolish.

688
00:47:40,916 --> 00:47:42,333
- Foolish?
- Yeah.

689
00:47:42,416 --> 00:47:44,041
Just, you get someone's file

690
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:47,333
and, uh, you form these preconceptions,
even when you know

691
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:50,083
there were plenty of circumstances
and not so many fair shakes.

692
00:47:50,666 --> 00:47:51,708
You still judge.

693
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:55,541
Hmm.

694
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,958
Anyone else here, um, know?

695
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:04,166
Oh, no. Our little secret.

696
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:06,541
Yeah.

697
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:10,500
Whoo!

698
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:14,416
This is good. A thousand copper pots
for Java like this.

699
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,666
Or maybe a field trip?
An Arizona girl-in-the-sunshine, huh?

700
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:27,083
Hi, Jeff. Uh…

701
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:30,333
I'm sorry, man.

702
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:33,666
Unfortunately, the committee
was very firm.

703
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:37,125
They insisted the test must be
continued as scheduled.

704
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:40,291
Otherwise, they're threatening
to remove you from this program

705
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,791
and send you back to State.

706
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:46,916
They need you to acknowledge, Jeff.

707
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,541
Okay, I'm gonna ask you
one last time. Drip on?

708
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,541
Yeah, acknowledge.

709
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:05,208
Thank you.

710
00:49:12,458 --> 00:49:13,916
Heather, hello again.

711
00:49:14,625 --> 00:49:16,666
Good morning, again.

712
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:17,750
Drip on?

713
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:20,708
Acknowledge.

714
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:22,583
Okay, Mark.

715
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:41,875
I don't like this.

716
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:48,416
Please. It's hurting.

717
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:52,583
What's wrong with me?

718
00:49:52,666 --> 00:49:55,125
- It can't hurt you.
- Shit.

719
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:59,500
Jeff, speak a lot, in detail.
Let's make something useful with this.

720
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:06,791
Heather just vomited.

721
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:08,791
She appears to be
in a highly aversive state.

722
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:11,583
Why don't you back us up?
What happened first?

723
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:12,916
She started to cry.

724
00:50:14,583 --> 00:50:16,625
She seems confused by how she's feeling.

725
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,541
Now she's crying harder.
She seems unable to sit still.

726
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:22,875
And what are you feeling?

727
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:28,666
- Melancholy. Culpability.
- Oh, no, please.

728
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,000
Mm-hmm.

729
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:31,083
Go on.

730
00:50:31,416 --> 00:50:33,333
No, no, no.

731
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:35,583
All I can think
is Heather was once a child.

732
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:39,083
Loved by her mother and father…

733
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,083
…neither foreseeing that
one day she might do a terrible thing.

734
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,458
A thing that would separate her
once and for all from love.

735
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:49,041
Good, go on.

736
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:52,916
Divorce her from joy
and cause her unspeakable sadness.

737
00:50:57,416 --> 00:50:58,958
And do you love her?

738
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:03,708
Help! Please! Please!

739
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:06,958
No.

740
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:12,250
Hang in there, Jeff.

741
00:51:12,333 --> 00:51:14,208
Hey, Mark. Any vestige of romantic love

742
00:51:14,291 --> 00:51:16,041
in Jeff's words?

743
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:17,267
- No.
- Great.

744
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:19,958
Just basic human feeling.

745
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:21,083
Excellent.

746
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:22,206
Steve.

747
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:24,375
{\an8}- Mm?
- I think it's flooding.

748
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:25,458
Get back!

749
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:26,375
Back off.

750
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,851
I did. The effects not...

751
00:51:28,875 --> 00:51:29,958
Try more red.

752
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:32,666
Heather is in great torment.

753
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:35,083
- Back it off.
- It's not working.

754
00:51:35,166 --> 00:51:38,958
Heather, listen to me. Sit down,
don't raise a finger, that's an order.

755
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:40,375
Get away from me, please!

756
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:42,458
Are you kidding me?

757
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:44,083
{\an8}Are you fucking kidding me?

758
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:45,583
Jesus.

759
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:47,041
This is bad. Get in there, go.

760
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:49,666
Shit.

761
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,875
Heather's destroying everything
within reach.

762
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:53,398
Sit down.
That is an order.

763
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:55,208
I'm responsible.

764
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:57,708
Stay the fuck away from me!

765
00:51:57,791 --> 00:51:58,625
I facilitated...

766
00:51:58,708 --> 00:52:02,083
Heather, listen to me, deep breaths,
everything's gonna be fine, okay?

767
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:03,166
Just relax.

768
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:13,458
Heather!

769
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:24,625
Oh, shit.

770
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,750
Oh, shit.

771
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:33,958
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

772
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:37,375
Oh, my God.

773
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:42,791
Oh, shit!

774
00:52:44,291 --> 00:52:45,583
Oh, my God.

775
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:49,416
Oh, shit.

776
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:51,791
God damn it, Mark.

777
00:52:55,458 --> 00:52:56,708
I don't feel a pulse.

778
00:52:56,791 --> 00:52:59,291
What is wrong with you?
I told you to back it off.

779
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:02,041
What? What?
What? I… I did back it off.

780
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:04,559
- Forget your…
- I told you this would happen.

781
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:06,791
She did not respond
to my direct order.

782
00:53:06,875 --> 00:53:08,083
You're talking shit.

783
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:12,083
You are afraid to commit…
I told you every time, don't hesitate!

784
00:53:12,166 --> 00:53:14,208
{\an8}I give an instruction, do what I say!

785
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:17,750
"Abnesti Pharmaceuticals"?

786
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:19,500
Steve, I warned you.

787
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:21,333
- You did not.
- This is his company.

788
00:53:21,416 --> 00:53:23,208
- I told you.
- Do not blame me!

789
00:53:23,291 --> 00:53:25,791
You did not listen, I told you.
This is your fault.

790
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:27,333
I told you. I told you.

791
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:30,750
- Give me…
- You remember that?

792
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:33,583
"Bingo"?

793
00:53:34,583 --> 00:53:36,083
You think I have one job?

794
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,625
N-40.

795
00:53:40,708 --> 00:53:43,083
Can I have your permission
to administer N-40? Drip on?

796
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:44,416
Acknowledge.

797
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:51,500
You see this remote?

798
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:55,416
{\an8}Let's say, you can slide this button
and Sarah gets some Darkenfloxx.

799
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:57,041
I-16.

800
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:00,541
What the hell?

801
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:08,450
- Where are you going?
- Shut up, Mark.

802
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:13,083
B-6.

803
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:17,041
I know it gets crazy in there,
but they're not made for jostling,

804
00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:18,250
they can flood.

805
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:14,208
It's not your fault.

806
00:55:16,541 --> 00:55:17,583
Not your fault.

807
00:55:58,708 --> 00:56:01,333
This has gone too far.
We need to report this.

808
00:56:01,416 --> 00:56:04,458
Grow up. You shouldn't act like
we've crossed some sort of line here.

809
00:56:04,541 --> 00:56:08,666
The time to worry about crossing lines
was a lot of lines ago.

810
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,875
If anyone finds out
what happened to Heather,

811
00:56:12,958 --> 00:56:14,625
they'll shut us down, Mark.

812
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:17,041
Everything I've accomplished will be lost,

813
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:19,208
and don't think
they'll just come after me.

814
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:20,625
You'll go down too.

815
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:23,375
Yeah.

816
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:28,833
Hey.

817
00:56:31,291 --> 00:56:32,291
I'm sorry.

818
00:56:34,416 --> 00:56:35,833
Okay, this was awful.

819
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,791
But what do I always tell you? Hmm?

820
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,291
Pressure forms diamonds.

821
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:44,250
Yeah.

822
00:56:45,583 --> 00:56:47,833
This is fine, okay?

823
00:56:47,916 --> 00:56:50,166
You and I,
we're gonna redouble our efforts.

824
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:54,291
<i>We're gonna gold star B-6,
and we'll change the world, Mark.</i>

825
00:56:55,583 --> 00:57:00,291
<i>And Heather?
Heather died for the best of causes, okay?</i>

826
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:03,750
Okay.

827
00:57:04,666 --> 00:57:05,833
"Okay" okay?

828
00:57:07,166 --> 00:57:08,000
- Okay.
- Yeah?

829
00:57:08,083 --> 00:57:09,833
- Okay.
- Yeah? Sure? Huh?

830
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:11,583
Come on, there you are.

831
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:13,875
Hey, just go take some time, relax.

832
00:57:13,958 --> 00:57:17,125
Whatever helps you forget,
get out of here, go on.

833
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:30,958
Damn it.

834
00:57:46,041 --> 00:57:47,041
Is she dead?

835
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:53,583
She's not the best.

836
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,750
That's not fair. Yeah. Yes, she's gone.

837
00:58:06,666 --> 00:58:09,125
This, uh… You know, this is science, Jeff.

838
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:14,416
And in science,
we have to explore the unknown.

839
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,958
The unknown can lead to the unforeseen,

840
00:58:17,041 --> 00:58:19,375
- and we had no way of predicting that...
- I get it.

841
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:24,125
Uh, your tone
of voice there, Jeff,

842
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:27,083
which I perfectly understand.

843
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:30,666
But be fair. You think
what happened today, you think I liked it?

844
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:34,291
I didn't. I'm a person too, you know, I…

845
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:40,041
I have feelings, and no one
is more broken up about this than me.

846
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:45,458
But in the long run,
our work will help ease suffering,

847
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:48,375
it'll save lives,
not just one life, many lives.

848
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:51,500
We're making the world a better place.

849
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:55,083
Are we?

850
00:58:55,166 --> 00:58:56,416
Yes, Jeff, we are.

851
00:58:57,583 --> 00:58:58,583
You should be proud.

852
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:02,250
Personal sadness aside,
you did terrific in there.

853
00:59:02,333 --> 00:59:04,958
We all did terrific. Heather, especially.

854
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,041
Right up into the point where she…

855
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:11,458
You know, it wasn't her finest moment,

856
00:59:11,541 --> 00:59:13,625
but everything prior to that,
she was doing great

857
00:59:13,708 --> 00:59:15,750
and she'll never be forgotten.

858
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:21,333
What?

859
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:22,875
It's just tough.

860
00:59:27,166 --> 00:59:28,166
Yeah.

861
00:59:30,708 --> 00:59:33,041
Can I get you something
for how you're feeling?

862
00:59:44,583 --> 00:59:48,208
I swear,
G-46 is good shit, right?

863
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:49,125
Yeah.

864
00:59:49,208 --> 00:59:52,458
Maybe not change-the-world shit,
but it's good shit.

865
00:59:52,541 --> 00:59:55,375
It's definitely good shit.

866
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:58,916
It's hard to have
even one sad thought on this stuff.

867
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:02,291
What's your worst memory?

868
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:03,875
What?

869
01:00:03,958 --> 01:00:06,541
I'm sorry, that's a stupid question.

870
01:00:10,291 --> 01:00:14,250
Mine, uh… Mine was… I was…

871
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:15,541
I was eight years old

872
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:20,791
and, uh, my dad told me
he was gonna take me to summer camp.

873
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:22,291
I was so excited.

874
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:26,666
And he dropped me off,
and it turns out it wasn't summer camp,

875
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,208
it was foster care…

876
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:31,250
…and I never saw him again.

877
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,833
Oh, my God.

878
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:35,833
I'm laughing too.

879
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:38,416
That's just so terrible, man.

880
01:00:39,041 --> 01:00:42,333
It seems funny. Try it.

881
01:00:42,416 --> 01:00:43,708
He never came back.

882
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:47,625
He never came back.
Not even for a weekend.

883
01:00:48,333 --> 01:00:50,208
I'm actually sorry to hear that, man.

884
01:00:51,458 --> 01:00:52,291
Damn.

885
01:00:52,375 --> 01:00:53,791
Oh, the dose is too strong.

886
01:00:56,958 --> 01:00:58,500
God.

887
01:00:59,375 --> 01:01:00,833
Man, look at us, huh?

888
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:03,375
Jeff and Steve.

889
01:01:03,916 --> 01:01:05,750
Steve and Jeff hanging out.

890
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:07,500
Friends.

891
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:08,750
Ehh…

892
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:10,166
What?

893
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,541
Come on, we're up here together.

894
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:15,041
Enjoying the view.
That's a friendly thing to do.

895
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:16,875
You can… Well…

896
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:22,958
You can walk out that door
anytime you want.

897
01:01:23,916 --> 01:01:24,916
I can't.

898
01:01:25,791 --> 01:01:28,250
No, I can't. Not anymore.

899
01:01:33,125 --> 01:01:34,166
What's stopping you?

900
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:41,500
The same thing that's stopping you
and every decision I've ever made.

901
01:01:41,583 --> 01:01:45,333
The ones that led me here to this place.

902
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,625
This is my one true love, Jeff.

903
01:01:49,666 --> 01:01:52,666
And once you fall in love,
it's hard to fall back out.

904
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:57,750
Okay.

905
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:04,791
Jeff and Steve… stuck at summer camp.

906
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,708
To Jeff and Steve. Not that different.

907
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:28,833
Get that fucking thing away from me!

908
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:31,958
Lizzy, listen. Deep breaths.
Everything's gonna be fine.

909
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:32,916
Please!

910
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,041
For the record, can you tell us
what you're so afraid of?

911
01:02:36,125 --> 01:02:37,666
<i>Get it the fuck away!</i>

912
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:39,375
The Verbaluce isn't doing shit.

913
01:02:40,208 --> 01:02:41,666
Yeah.

914
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:43,625
This one's a goodie.

915
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:47,166
Phobica.

916
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:48,708
Please stop it! Please stop!

917
01:02:48,791 --> 01:02:51,416
Make people afraid of things
that are bad for them.

918
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:52,500
What, like gluten?

919
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:54,250
Yeah. Or thinking too much.

920
01:03:02,083 --> 01:03:04,541
Please, get that fucking thing
away from me!

921
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:07,708
I'm worried about
post-traumatic stress.

922
01:03:07,791 --> 01:03:09,083
From the stapler?

923
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:12,500
Hey, Lizzy? Lizzy, it's just a stapler.

924
01:03:12,583 --> 01:03:13,750
Just get away now!

925
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:15,375
What, should we pack it in?

926
01:03:17,708 --> 01:03:19,375
Steve, should we pack it in?

927
01:03:20,791 --> 01:03:22,500
Yeah, okay.

928
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:31,333
The worst one yet. By far.

929
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:34,916
How do you feel now?

930
01:03:37,916 --> 01:03:40,458
Not afraid. Just, uh…

931
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:41,583
Ashamed?

932
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:45,791
Yeah, I hate that feeling.

933
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:51,375
I couldn't stand
feeling that way in front of you.

934
01:03:51,458 --> 01:03:53,250
That's why I asked to be off snack.

935
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:04,916
You know, all the years I spent at State.

936
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:07,666
I come here, and I'm, like…

937
01:04:08,375 --> 01:04:10,833
Is this place even really so much better?

938
01:04:10,916 --> 01:04:11,916
Hmm.

939
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:14,500
I mean, I'd take some beat downs.

940
01:04:15,125 --> 01:04:17,833
Instead of having a fear
of a goddamn stapler.

941
01:04:20,416 --> 01:04:22,541
Why do we keep saying yes?

942
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:26,416
Acknowledge, acknowledge, acknowledge.

943
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:30,083
And for what? A private hall pass?

944
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:33,708
A bedroom to ourselves?
Copper freakin' pots? I mean…

945
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:43,791
All the times you've said yes,
why did you?

946
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:51,833
I guess I felt like I deserved it.

947
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,416
That's what I've been
meaning to tell you, Lizzy.

948
01:05:02,708 --> 01:05:05,083
<i>Yeah. I think I might go with them.</i>

949
01:05:07,208 --> 01:05:08,416
Hey.

950
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:13,833
Hey. Wait up.

951
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:16,416
She can't live without me.

952
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:26,291
You cool to drive?

953
01:05:26,916 --> 01:05:27,958
Ice cold.

954
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:32,500
Whoo!

955
01:05:55,375 --> 01:05:56,416
Whoo!

956
01:06:11,041 --> 01:06:12,666
Oh, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff!

957
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,625
Jeff!

958
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,500
Emma. Come on, baby. Come on.

959
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:46,041
Emma! Come on, baby. Come on.

960
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:00,166
<i>Hey, babe.</i>

961
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:03,500
<i>I know you're probably getting sick of me
leaving these things for you,</i>

962
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:08,000
<i>but I just wanted to tell you
the usual that I miss you…</i>

963
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:13,541
<i>And I'm sorry.</i>

964
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:15,916
<i>The mailbox
for this customer is full.</i>

965
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,666
<i>It cannot receive
any more messages at this time.</i>

966
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:26,958
I'm so sorry.

967
01:07:31,208 --> 01:07:33,333
Two counts, voluntary manslaughter.

968
01:07:35,833 --> 01:07:37,708
And that doesn't include Heather.

969
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:40,916
Don't do that to yourself.

970
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:42,875
That's not on you.

971
01:07:44,416 --> 01:07:46,125
You did everything you could.

972
01:07:46,208 --> 01:07:47,208
No.

973
01:07:48,458 --> 01:07:49,875
I said "acknowledge."

974
01:07:51,916 --> 01:07:53,500
And I don't even know why.

975
01:08:00,291 --> 01:08:01,666
You're a good soul.

976
01:08:40,791 --> 01:08:43,750
We're bad. We're very bad.

977
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:52,333
For what it's worth, I think
we're the least of all evils in here.

978
01:08:53,583 --> 01:08:55,125
Yeah? What makes you say that?

979
01:08:56,375 --> 01:08:57,500
You hear things.

980
01:08:57,583 --> 01:08:58,958
Oh, you hear things?

981
01:08:59,041 --> 01:09:00,750
Yeah. You know Ray?

982
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:01,833
Mm-hmm.

983
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,125
So, after four times in jail for drugs,
Ray went to rehab

984
01:09:07,208 --> 01:09:09,791
and then to what they call
a rehab refresh,

985
01:09:09,875 --> 01:09:13,583
which is basically for people
who are so immune to rehab,

986
01:09:13,666 --> 01:09:15,375
- it stops working.
- Hmm.

987
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:20,291
But he must have been immune to that too,
because then came his biggie.

988
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:22,458
Triple murder.

989
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:30,166
Yeah, his dealer, the dealer's sister,
and the dealer's sister's boyfriend.

990
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,083
Shit, man.

991
01:09:36,416 --> 01:09:37,416
You know Rogan?

992
01:09:38,416 --> 01:09:40,041
- Big diesel Rogan. Hell, yeah.
- Yeah.

993
01:09:40,125 --> 01:09:42,541
- Who doesn't know Rogan?
- He came home.

994
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:47,125
Found his girlfriend cheating on him
and threw her out an eight-story window.

995
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:48,416
Oh, shit.

996
01:09:49,916 --> 01:09:51,041
She did not survive.

997
01:09:53,333 --> 01:09:54,375
Crazy.

998
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:55,750
Yeah, I don't get it.

999
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:59,000
- Like, how's it possible, man?
- What?

1000
01:10:00,125 --> 01:10:02,166
If we're all so bad, where's the bad?

1001
01:10:04,416 --> 01:10:05,875
You guys are up late.

1002
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:08,333
Yeah.

1003
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:10,666
Cheat day.

1004
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:16,125
Oh, Jeff, we may wanna reconsider
the community snack bowl, given, uh…

1005
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:17,208
Shit-finger.

1006
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,916
Yeah. Have a wonderful evening.

1007
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:22,166
- And you.
- And you.

1008
01:11:02,916 --> 01:11:03,916
Bingo.

1009
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:36,166
Yes.

1010
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:39,541
Okay. I understand. Mm-hmm.

1011
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:40,625
Thank you.

1012
01:11:41,416 --> 01:11:44,000
Hey, Jeff, thanks for coming in.
How're you feeling?

1013
01:11:44,541 --> 01:11:45,541
Uh, I'm good.

1014
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:50,750
All right, good. Uh, listen,
this breaks my heart wide open.

1015
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:55,625
But Protcom are insisting
on one last trial to establish a baseline.

1016
01:11:55,708 --> 01:11:56,541
Uh, we…

1017
01:11:56,625 --> 01:12:01,041
You have to administer Darkenfloxx
to someone you've never shared N-40 with.

1018
01:12:05,916 --> 01:12:06,916
Someone who?

1019
01:12:07,958 --> 01:12:11,166
That's what breaks my heart, Jeff.
It really does.

1020
01:12:12,333 --> 01:12:14,000
Eh, Mark, if you would.

1021
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:31,375
No. Sorry, I can't do it.

1022
01:12:31,458 --> 01:12:32,750
Of course you can, Jeff.

1023
01:12:32,833 --> 01:12:35,875
This is the last time
anyone's gonna get Darkenfloxxed, okay?

1024
01:12:35,958 --> 01:12:37,625
Yeah, uh, Lizzy doesn't deserve this.

1025
01:12:37,708 --> 01:12:39,875
It won't go as far this time.
You have my word.

1026
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:41,208
You're not listening to me.

1027
01:12:41,291 --> 01:12:44,291
Jeff, come on. You sound nothing like
the guy that first arrived here.

1028
01:12:44,375 --> 01:12:47,458
That guy would've done anything
to make his crime right.

1029
01:12:47,541 --> 01:12:49,416
Would you just shut up, man?

1030
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:55,000
I'm not doing it.

1031
01:12:57,916 --> 01:12:58,916
Calm.

1032
01:13:06,375 --> 01:13:09,333
Maybe we should take the night. Yeah?

1033
01:13:10,458 --> 01:13:12,541
Things always feel better in the morning.

1034
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:16,333
Yeah, sure.

1035
01:13:26,291 --> 01:13:30,583
Just remember, Jeff, uh, what you did
won't have to happen to anyone again.

1036
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:33,833
Drugs like this
will prevent places like this.

1037
01:13:34,958 --> 01:13:37,250
No more damage, no more damaged people.

1038
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:41,583
Only you can prevent another you.

1039
01:13:48,916 --> 01:13:50,000
Double his dose.

1040
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:09,291
I know you're struggling,
but this will help.

1041
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,833
What's in the red one?

1042
01:14:16,958 --> 01:14:19,416
Sorry.

1043
01:14:24,291 --> 01:14:25,500
It's just a toy.

1044
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:32,041
The red one's a placebo. We put it...

1045
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:33,125
Stop.

1046
01:14:34,541 --> 01:14:35,625
Just stop.

1047
01:14:41,125 --> 01:14:43,208
There is no Protocol Committee, is there?

1048
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:47,000
This is his company.

1049
01:14:48,166 --> 01:14:49,875
I saw his letterhead.

1050
01:14:53,625 --> 01:14:55,250
Abnesti Pharmaceuticals.

1051
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:00,875
He's the one in charge

1052
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:04,083
and he's naming the drugs
using a goddamn Bingo card, Mark.

1053
01:15:05,208 --> 01:15:07,583
What are you doing
working at a place like this?

1054
01:15:08,958 --> 01:15:11,875
I mean, all this talk of N-40,
I call bullshit, man.

1055
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:16,125
Abnesti doesn't care about love.

1056
01:15:18,166 --> 01:15:19,833
No, he cares about the red one.

1057
01:15:22,958 --> 01:15:23,958
B-6.

1058
01:15:28,041 --> 01:15:29,875
How can you go along with this?

1059
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:33,000
You could work anywhere.

1060
01:15:33,833 --> 01:15:36,250
<i>Why here? Why him?</i>

1061
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:43,500
There are so few geniuses.

1062
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:48,750
<i>He promised me we would change the world.</i>

1063
01:15:51,333 --> 01:15:53,041
<i>I just wanted to help people.</i>

1064
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:58,666
You still can.

1065
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:28,833
Hey, Jeff, man of the hour.

1066
01:16:31,583 --> 01:16:34,458
Hope you got some sleep,
thought things over, yeah?

1067
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:37,458
Why don't you, uh, take the driver's seat?

1068
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:38,708
Mark's out today.

1069
01:16:38,791 --> 01:16:41,375
He's got a stuffed up nose
or something.

1070
01:16:43,458 --> 01:16:44,500
Millennials, huh?

1071
01:16:47,041 --> 01:16:49,875
Sorry, that's a… It's an unfair word.

1072
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:52,833
You think about it,
someone arbitrarily decides

1073
01:16:52,916 --> 01:16:56,583
that everyone born between this date
and that date, they all act the same.

1074
01:16:56,666 --> 01:17:00,333
It's like a… A horoscope, but stupider.

1075
01:17:04,041 --> 01:17:05,791
You and Mark are nothing alike.

1076
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I don't know.

1077
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:10,958
It was Mark who made me reconsider.

1078
01:17:12,125 --> 01:17:13,166
Ah.

1079
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:16,333
Well, I'll forgive his sniffles.

1080
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:25,958
Anyway, so it's you and me
and Lizzy, makes three.

1081
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:27,875
How're you doing, Lizzy?

1082
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:30,833
Could use some Vitamin D.

1083
01:17:30,916 --> 01:17:33,000
We'll get you
some sunshine soon enough.

1084
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:35,250
All right, Jeff.

1085
01:17:35,333 --> 01:17:39,666
Uh, I filled Lizzy's vials with
the last of the Darkenfloxx this morning.

1086
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:41,708
Dumped the rest. Gone.

1087
01:17:42,916 --> 01:17:45,458
Shall we put this thing
behind us for good?

1088
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,291
Fine. Let's do this.

1089
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:52,416
Lizzy? Drip on?

1090
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:54,541
Yeah, acknowledge.

1091
01:17:55,708 --> 01:17:59,166
And, Jeff,
give Lizzy the Darkenfloxx.

1092
01:18:33,916 --> 01:18:34,916
Sorry.

1093
01:18:37,041 --> 01:18:38,041
Hmm?

1094
01:18:40,625 --> 01:18:42,000
The answer is still no.

1095
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:45,166
J… Jeff.

1096
01:18:46,958 --> 01:18:49,375
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1097
01:18:53,833 --> 01:18:56,625
Okay. What are we
up against here, Jeff? Huh?

1098
01:18:57,291 --> 01:19:01,083
You think you love her?
You don't even know her.

1099
01:19:01,166 --> 01:19:04,458
I swear, the judgment on display
in this fucking building!

1100
01:19:05,625 --> 01:19:08,333
How about
a little share circle, huh? Yeah.

1101
01:19:08,416 --> 01:19:10,833
Why don't you
tell Jeff what you're in for?

1102
01:19:10,916 --> 01:19:13,125
- I don't care.
- That's what love is.

1103
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:15,708
Getting to know each other.
Let's get to know each other.

1104
01:19:15,791 --> 01:19:17,458
Doesn't matter. She already told me.

1105
01:19:17,541 --> 01:19:20,041
- Oh, did she?
- Robbery. Big deal.

1106
01:19:20,666 --> 01:19:22,750
Really? Is that what you told him, Lizzy?

1107
01:19:22,833 --> 01:19:24,666
Your future husband, father of your kids.

1108
01:19:24,750 --> 01:19:27,416
He deserves to know the truth.
Tell him. Come on.

1109
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:28,833
Hmm?

1110
01:19:28,916 --> 01:19:29,833
You don't have to.

1111
01:19:29,916 --> 01:19:31,041
Come on. Tell him.

1112
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:33,708
Come on, Lizzy, tell him. Tell him.

1113
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:38,291
No? All right, I'll do it. Okay?

1114
01:19:38,375 --> 01:19:41,583
It's cool. I got your files right here.
Let's, uh… Let's see.

1115
01:19:42,291 --> 01:19:44,500
Yeah? Let's find out about Lizzy.

1116
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:46,500
- Get to know each other.
- I don't need you to.

1117
01:19:46,583 --> 01:19:49,416
- I know who I am and what I've done.
- Elizabeth Dianne Harris.

1118
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,458
Born in Prescott, Arizona.

1119
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:54,666
- Raised in a group home…
- I don't need you to. I know who I am.

1120
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:57,708
I know who I am!
I'm the mother who killed her baby.

1121
01:20:10,583 --> 01:20:11,875
That's who I am, Jeff.

1122
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:17,875
The mother
who forgot her little girl in her car

1123
01:20:17,958 --> 01:20:21,166
at a Walmart parking lot
in July for three hours…

1124
01:20:24,041 --> 01:20:25,375
While I went to work.

1125
01:20:28,791 --> 01:20:31,666
One count, reckless endangerment.
One count, manslaughter

1126
01:20:33,541 --> 01:20:35,333
of my nine-month-old little girl.

1127
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:39,333
My own…

1128
01:20:42,666 --> 01:20:44,291
My own flesh and blood.

1129
01:20:54,958 --> 01:20:59,708
Now, I don't know what kind of
sick-ass experiment this is,

1130
01:21:01,416 --> 01:21:05,708
but whatever he wants you to do to me,
come on, let's get on with it, okay?

1131
01:21:05,791 --> 01:21:09,291
The quicker we get over with,
it'll be better for all of us.

1132
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:13,958
Come on, man. You can't hurt me.

1133
01:21:18,208 --> 01:21:19,291
You can't hurt me.

1134
01:21:20,291 --> 01:21:22,125
There's no greater pain
than having to wake up

1135
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:25,166
every fucking morning without her. Okay?

1136
01:21:26,375 --> 01:21:28,666
And I know you think you love me,

1137
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:32,375
but anything in me worth loving
died with her long ago.

1138
01:21:32,458 --> 01:21:36,041
So, come on. Let's do it.
Come on. Give it to me.

1139
01:21:36,666 --> 01:21:37,833
Fucking give it to me.

1140
01:21:38,625 --> 01:21:41,791
Give it to me! Fucking do your job, Jeff!

1141
01:21:41,875 --> 01:21:43,416
Give it to me!

1142
01:21:46,041 --> 01:21:47,250
Give it to me.

1143
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:49,083
Please.

1144
01:22:18,541 --> 01:22:19,541
Sorry.

1145
01:22:20,666 --> 01:22:21,708
What's so funny?

1146
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:24,208
Uh, no…

1147
01:22:24,291 --> 01:22:26,083
Her sitting in there, this whole thing,

1148
01:22:26,166 --> 01:22:28,958
you with that phone,
everyone acting all serious.

1149
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:32,333
{\an8}Is it just me who finds this amusing?

1150
01:22:34,208 --> 01:22:35,208
{\an8}Yeah.

1151
01:22:36,166 --> 01:22:37,666
{\an8}Only you.

1152
01:22:50,291 --> 01:22:52,583
Mark's not sick, is he?

1153
01:22:54,583 --> 01:22:56,250
- Give me that.
- No.

1154
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:02,750
Stop it. Stop it, you're scaring me, okay?

1155
01:23:02,833 --> 01:23:05,875
Just stop. Stop. Please don't hurt me.

1156
01:23:05,958 --> 01:23:07,458
Don't… Don't hurt me. Okay?

1157
01:23:08,666 --> 01:23:11,166
Oh, fuck. Christ.

1158
01:23:13,708 --> 01:23:14,708
God…

1159
01:23:15,083 --> 01:23:17,833
Mark spiked my MobiPak.

1160
01:23:17,916 --> 01:23:22,750
That's right. He emptied my MobiPak
and gave you Darkenfloxx.

1161
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:25,916
<i>He's coming back here
right now with the police.</i>

1162
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,666
<i>How could he?</i>

1163
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:29,875
He and I… You and I were…

1164
01:23:30,458 --> 01:23:32,458
Make it stop!

1165
01:23:33,958 --> 01:23:36,041
- Can I get you something…
- Make it stop!

1166
01:23:36,125 --> 01:23:37,458
…for how you're feeling?

1167
01:23:38,583 --> 01:23:40,791
That was the first thing you said to me…

1168
01:23:42,875 --> 01:23:46,416
…the acknowledgement that you needed
for the most important study of them all.

1169
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,291
- And what did we say?
- Yes!

1170
01:23:49,375 --> 01:23:51,166
What were we saying yes to, huh?

1171
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:54,708
What were we agreeing
to put in our bodies every single day?

1172
01:23:57,541 --> 01:23:59,375
B-6.

1173
01:23:59,458 --> 01:24:01,833
It doesn't make you
happy or hungry or horny.

1174
01:24:01,916 --> 01:24:03,666
It makes you do as you're told.

1175
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:08,000
"Laugh, stop laughing.
Eat, stop eating. Fuck, stop fucking!"

1176
01:24:08,916 --> 01:24:12,458
You weren't testing those other drugs.
You were testing B-6.

1177
01:24:12,541 --> 01:24:14,083
Yeah. Sorry. I'm sorry.

1178
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:16,208
I'm sorry.

1179
01:24:19,666 --> 01:24:21,583
What were you gonna call it?

1180
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:26,083
Fine then.

1181
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:32,458
What were you going to call it?

1182
01:24:33,541 --> 01:24:35,583
O-B-D-X.

1183
01:24:36,291 --> 01:24:37,833
Obediex.

1184
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:40,875
<i>And it did work.</i>

1185
01:24:40,958 --> 01:24:44,916
Enough for you to live amongst killers.
But not enough for a gold star. Why?

1186
01:24:46,375 --> 01:24:48,250
B-6 had to be perfect.

1187
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,125
The goal wasn't obedience.

1188
01:24:50,208 --> 01:24:53,291
It was absolute obedience
without exceptions.

1189
01:24:54,166 --> 01:24:57,166
We had to know,
could we get you to follow an order

1190
01:24:57,250 --> 01:25:01,583
antithetical to
your deepest values and emotions.

1191
01:25:01,666 --> 01:25:04,541
Do the very thing
you'd least want to do in the world.

1192
01:25:05,458 --> 01:25:06,958
Hurt someone you love.

1193
01:25:07,041 --> 01:25:10,791
B-6 could force you to repeat
the precise act you most regretted,

1194
01:25:10,875 --> 01:25:13,375
to harm another,
someone you held dear.

1195
01:25:13,458 --> 01:25:15,666
It could force anyone to do anything.

1196
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:18,125
I trusted you.

1197
01:25:19,208 --> 01:25:21,833
We trusted you with our lives!

1198
01:25:23,416 --> 01:25:26,083
You made us do
all this shit to each other,

1199
01:25:26,166 --> 01:25:28,458
thinking it was our choice,
but it was yours.

1200
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:31,083
You took away our...

1201
01:25:31,166 --> 01:25:33,000
Your what? Your free will, Jeff?

1202
01:25:33,083 --> 01:25:35,875
Oh, God. Where did that get you, huh?

1203
01:25:38,375 --> 01:25:39,750
Can't you picture it?

1204
01:25:39,833 --> 01:25:43,041
A world filled with people
who do as they're told.

1205
01:25:47,458 --> 01:25:50,083
We'd be selling peace and harmony itself.

1206
01:25:50,166 --> 01:25:53,916
The ability to compel people to act
on behalf of the greater good.

1207
01:25:55,791 --> 01:25:58,500
Behave, not as they want,
but as they damn well should.

1208
01:26:00,333 --> 01:26:05,125
No more drunks crashing cars.
Husbands killing wives.

1209
01:26:05,208 --> 01:26:06,625
Kids left at summer camp.

1210
01:26:09,541 --> 01:26:11,375
What does it matter? B-6 failed.

1211
01:26:12,708 --> 01:26:15,375
I want you to tell the world
what you did to Heather.

1212
01:26:16,875 --> 01:26:20,541
Man, I could go to…
I could go to prison, it would ruin me.

1213
01:26:20,625 --> 01:26:23,416
Everything I built.
I could go to prison, Jeff.

1214
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:27,125
Jeff and Steve. Not that different.

1215
01:26:29,208 --> 01:26:30,208
Yeah.

1216
01:26:31,583 --> 01:26:32,583
What's so funny?

1217
01:26:35,833 --> 01:26:38,333
You were free to go seven months ago.

1218
01:26:39,541 --> 01:26:42,750
And Lizzy, her appeal
just fell on very sympathetic ears.

1219
01:26:43,208 --> 01:26:44,625
She's been free for a week.

1220
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:56,583
She's walking out of here. Today.

1221
01:26:57,708 --> 01:26:59,458
Open the front door.

1222
01:27:06,958 --> 01:27:10,291
{\an8}I'm gonna make sure
you never do this to anyone ever again.

1223
01:27:22,333 --> 01:27:23,541
Give me the knife.

1224
01:27:26,625 --> 01:27:29,916
I said… give it to me.

1225
01:27:30,958 --> 01:27:31,958
Why?

1226
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:35,875
Because I told you to, Steve,

1227
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:39,750
and because I put enough B-6
in your veins to tame a goddamn lion.

1228
01:27:45,791 --> 01:27:46,916
Really works, huh?

1229
01:27:48,250 --> 01:27:51,750
Not when someone has been told
to kill the only thing he's ever loved.

1230
01:27:54,666 --> 01:27:55,833
I learned that from you.

1231
01:28:12,833 --> 01:28:15,500
I just Darkenfloxxed Lizzy.
All four vials.

1232
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:33,000
Hey.

1233
01:29:45,666 --> 01:29:47,833
It's okay. You're okay.

1234
01:29:50,875 --> 01:29:52,666
It's okay.

1235
01:29:54,708 --> 01:29:56,791
I'm so… I'm so sorry.

1236
01:29:57,333 --> 01:29:58,333
For what?

1237
01:29:59,375 --> 01:30:01,416
I'm sorry I lied.

1238
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:03,083
Lizzy, I love you.

1239
01:30:04,875 --> 01:30:06,791
Nothing you said or did
is gonna change that.

1240
01:30:25,291 --> 01:30:26,958
Friends and neighbors,

1241
01:30:27,041 --> 01:30:30,333
I'm sorry to interrupt,
particularly with news like this.

1242
01:30:32,041 --> 01:30:33,833
We have an attempted escape.

1243
01:30:34,625 --> 01:30:36,750
Most of you know Jeff and Lizzy.

1244
01:30:41,583 --> 01:30:43,208
Most of you know Jeff and Lizzy,

1245
01:30:43,291 --> 01:30:47,500
<i>and it saddens me to my core
that they have misled the authorities</i>

1246
01:30:47,583 --> 01:30:49,000
<i>who are on the way here now.</i>

1247
01:30:49,083 --> 01:30:51,375
I explained that that would mean
the end of the program

1248
01:30:51,458 --> 01:30:55,125
and the comfortable life that it affords
us all, but they wouldn't listen.

1249
01:30:57,708 --> 01:30:58,708
Oh, no.

1250
01:31:02,541 --> 01:31:06,291
Do any of you relish
the thought of returning to State?

1251
01:31:06,375 --> 01:31:08,708
<i>What would you
be willing to do to prevent that</i>

1252
01:31:08,791 --> 01:31:11,375
<i>to preserve the noble mission…</i>

1253
01:31:11,458 --> 01:31:12,291
<i>Fuck!</i>

1254
01:31:12,375 --> 01:31:14,083
…to which we've devoted our lives?

1255
01:31:15,708 --> 01:31:17,375
Fucking piece of shit!

1256
01:31:23,291 --> 01:31:27,416
{\an8}Stop Jeff and Lizzy, not for me, for you.

1257
01:31:32,791 --> 01:31:33,958
Fuck!

1258
01:31:50,125 --> 01:31:51,125
Shit-finger?

1259
01:32:11,166 --> 01:32:12,625
I knew it was you, snack man.

1260
01:32:55,208 --> 01:32:56,208
There they are!

1261
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:20,125
Come on, get 'em. Get up! Come on!

1262
01:33:28,583 --> 01:33:30,000
Hold on, Dave.

1263
01:33:31,958 --> 01:33:33,458
I have a key to the pantry.

1264
01:33:35,541 --> 01:33:37,333
It has food in it for, like, six months.

1265
01:33:40,875 --> 01:33:43,625
Awesome. Thanks.

1266
01:34:22,458 --> 01:34:25,041
{\an8}Alpha Whiskey Delta,
departing to the north.

1267
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:34,333
Alpha Whiskey Delta…

1268
01:34:34,416 --> 01:34:36,750
…on climb, 2,000 feet,

1269
01:34:38,416 --> 01:34:40,458
heading east to track zero…

1270
01:34:45,083 --> 01:34:46,083
Sorry.

1271
01:34:48,166 --> 01:34:50,041
Zero-nine-zero…

1272

01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:56,351
<i>Alpha Whiskey
Delta, that transmission was gargled.</i>

1274
01:34:56,375 --> 01:34:58,000
<i>Do you require any assistance?</i>

1275
01:34:59,291 --> 01:35:00,875
Handle your…

1276

Handle your… Handle your shit.

1277

<i>Alpha Whiskey Delta,
confirm intentions.</i>

1278
01:36:05,708 --> 01:36:09,625
<i>We have you bearing northwest, 315,
descending below 500 feet.</i>

1279
01:36:09,708 --> 01:36:10,833
<i>Do you copy?</i>

1280
01:36:18,875 --> 01:36:21,916
<i>Glide slope. Pull up.</i>

1281
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:24,833
<i>Glide slope. Pull up.</i>

1282
01:36:25,666 --> 01:36:27,500
<i>Glide slope. Pull up.</i>

1283
01:36:27,583 --> 01:36:28,625
It's beautiful.

1284
01:37:08,791 --> 01:37:10,083
Sun feels nice.

1285
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,458
<i>I wish there was
a self-forgiveness drug.</i>

1286
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,166
<i>You take it and everything starts over.</i>

1287
01:37:31,833 --> 01:37:34,875
<i>Everyone you ever loved,
you did right by them.</i>

1288

<i>Treated them like gold
and you feel like it's all ahead of me.</i>

1289
01:37:40,041 --> 01:37:43,166
<i>This beautiful life,
all the pleasures of it.</i>

1290
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:46,125
<i>The love I could give,
the good I could do.</i>

1291
01:37:48,416 --> 01:37:50,083
<i>But there's no drug like that.</i>

1292
01:37:53,041 --> 01:37:55,208
<i>So, we're gonna
have to do it for ourselves.</i>
