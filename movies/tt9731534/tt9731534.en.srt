3
00:02:17,156 --> 00:02:18,291
I appreciate it.

4
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:20,326
I know that your
relatives are scattered.

5
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,462
We'd be happy
to come back.

6
00:02:22,494 --> 00:02:23,863
Are you sure
you'll be all right?

7
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:26,466
Yes. I'll be fine.
Thank you.

8
00:02:26,498 --> 00:02:30,069
I fly back to Detroit tonight.
I'll get in late,

9
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:32,838
but call me if you
need to. Anytime.

10
00:02:32,872 --> 00:02:35,308
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm. I'll be okay.

11
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:38,444
Okay. I know you will.
Take care, sweetheart.

12
00:02:38,478 --> 00:02:40,846
I will. Bye.

13
00:04:53,913 --> 00:04:55,081
<i>So, raise your hand</i>

14
00:04:55,114 --> 00:04:58,017
<i>if you have better taste
in music than the groom.</i>

15
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,319
<i>Do I see any hands?</i>

16
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:01,988
<i>All right, yeah,
I see a few.</i>

17
00:10:28,147 --> 00:10:30,282
What we're looking
at here are the EOCT scores.

18
00:10:30,316 --> 00:10:32,518
Now, I'm gonna pick on
10th grade just a little bit

19
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:35,154
because you'll see
the biggest difference there.

20
00:10:35,187 --> 00:10:38,557
The yellow line, the mustardy
one, that's two years ago.

21
00:10:38,591 --> 00:10:40,226
The blue is last year.

22
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:42,495
The pink is this year.

23
00:10:44,797 --> 00:10:46,332
Beth is here.

24
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:49,702
Give her space.

25
00:10:49,735 --> 00:10:53,372
The pink is this year.
So, what happened?

26
00:10:53,405 --> 00:10:54,908
Teacher-student ratio.

27
00:10:54,941 --> 00:10:58,611
I know, but class sizes
are what they are. It's statewide.

28
00:10:58,644 --> 00:11:01,480
We can't play the blame game
when we're pulling up the rear...

29
00:11:01,514 --> 00:11:02,781
Sorry.

30
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:05,684
- Hey.
- Hi.

31
00:11:05,718 --> 00:11:09,655
I don't think you had to come.
No one would blame you.

32
00:11:09,688 --> 00:11:11,190
I still have
grades to enter.

33
00:11:11,223 --> 00:11:14,059
I'd have done that for you.
All you had to do is ask.

34
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:15,194
It's all right.

35
00:11:15,227 --> 00:11:17,964
It gives me something to do.
For now, anyway.

36
00:11:17,998 --> 00:11:19,265
We don't
wanna be that school.

37
00:11:19,298 --> 00:11:20,466
You holdin' up?

38
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:22,034
I don't want
to be that principal.

39
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:24,436
Yeah, I'm fine.

40
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,873
Just didn't really
sleep well last night.

41
00:11:26,907 --> 00:11:29,408
Can't believe you slept at all.
Especially there.

42
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:31,544
We got to
show up for them.

43
00:11:31,577 --> 00:11:33,546
Okay.
I promised to give you all

44
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:35,614
a 10-minute break,
so let's go ahead and take that.

45
00:11:35,648 --> 00:11:38,317
Go potty, stretch your legs.
There are more donuts in the back,

46
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:41,220
courtesy of Mountville Baptist
Church, so get you some,

47
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:43,622
and be back by 8:40 though,
on the dot-ish.

48
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:18,490
Mrs. Parchin?

49
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:21,193
Hi.

50
00:12:29,335 --> 00:12:30,469
Sorry. I was just...

51
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:32,504
Excuse me.
I tried to knock, but...

52
00:12:32,538 --> 00:12:34,239
We met before.

53
00:12:34,273 --> 00:12:36,175
Um, I'm Hunter's mom.

54
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:39,012
- Hunter...
- McLaughlin.

55
00:12:39,045 --> 00:12:40,179
He has you
second period.

56
00:12:40,212 --> 00:12:42,815
I'm Becky McLaughlin.
It was a few months ago.

57
00:12:42,848 --> 00:12:43,883
Right. Of course.

58
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:46,785
I... I have so many Hunters
this year.

59
00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:49,188
- Oh. How many?
- Hmm?

60
00:12:49,221 --> 00:12:51,590
Students named Hunter
do you have?

61
00:12:51,624 --> 00:12:53,559
Mm... Three.

62
00:12:53,592 --> 00:12:56,528
Please, have a seat.

63
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:04,269
I'm sure you know
why I'm here.

64
00:13:06,705 --> 00:13:08,807
I checked the website.

65
00:13:08,841 --> 00:13:10,910
Hunter got a C in speech.

66
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,246
Oh, right. I think so.

67
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,882
Uh... Let me check.

68
00:13:15,915 --> 00:13:17,850
- But that's what it said.
- Mm-hmm.

69
00:13:18,885 --> 00:13:20,719
Let me see here.

70
00:13:20,753 --> 00:13:23,455
Uh... Right, yes.

71
00:13:23,489 --> 00:13:26,492
It looks like he didn't do
his last presentation.

72
00:13:26,525 --> 00:13:28,794
He said that you told him
he could make that up.

73
00:13:28,827 --> 00:13:29,695
I did.

74
00:13:29,728 --> 00:13:32,264
Yeah. He, uh...
He didn't.

75
00:13:32,297 --> 00:13:34,833
He said he came in
last Thursday.

76
00:13:34,868 --> 00:13:36,970
That was
the last day of school.

77
00:13:37,003 --> 00:13:39,238
He said that
you weren't here.

78
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:43,877
Yes, I was out for a few days.
It was a personal matter.

79
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:48,213
Well, he told me he was out the
day you presented those projects.

80
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:50,749
We all have personal matters
to deal with sometimes.

81
00:13:52,351 --> 00:13:54,386
Okay. Uh...

82
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,956
You know what?
Let's just excuse him

83
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,757
from that assignment.

84
00:13:58,791 --> 00:13:59,825
Uh...

85
00:13:59,859 --> 00:14:01,360
There. B.

86
00:14:01,393 --> 00:14:05,131
That's not what I wanted.

87
00:14:05,165 --> 00:14:07,499
Then, uh, what did you want?

88
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:09,301
Excuse me?

89
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:11,370
When you came in here,
what did you want?

90
00:14:11,403 --> 00:14:13,338
I want to know
why my son...

91
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:16,408
My husband shot himself
in the head last Thursday.

92
00:14:20,046 --> 00:14:21,915
I hadn't heard.

93
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:25,718
No, because
it's a personal matter.

94
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:27,720
So, yeah.

95
00:14:27,753 --> 00:14:30,489
Yeah. If you wanna know,

96
00:14:30,522 --> 00:14:31,858
he took the boat out
on the lake.

97
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:34,994
He took a handgun that I
didn't even know that we owned.

98
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:38,564
And pow!
Right in the mouth.

99
00:14:38,597 --> 00:14:40,566
So, which Hunter
got what grade

100
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:44,670
on what high school elective
speech class assignment,

101
00:14:45,771 --> 00:14:48,340
it really doesn't matter
to me right now.

102
00:14:48,373 --> 00:14:52,511
So, you want a B,
you got a B.

103
00:14:53,445 --> 00:14:55,748
I... I apologize.

104
00:14:55,781 --> 00:14:57,083
Oh, you want an A?

105
00:14:57,117 --> 00:14:58,918
All right. Ta-da!

106
00:14:59,318 --> 00:15:01,121
A B is fine.

107
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:02,654
B it is.

108
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:07,726
Anything else
I can do for you?

109
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:09,561
No.

110
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,931
Thank you.

111
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,737
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

112
00:16:12,258 --> 00:16:15,727
- Oh. Hey, Mel.
- Hey.

113
00:16:15,761 --> 00:16:17,096
The sky was looking
a little mean.

114
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,398
I went ahead and covered the boat for
you, just in case.

115
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:20,632
You didn't have to do that.

116
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,869
Ah, that's a goddamn lie
if I've ever heard one.

117
00:16:22,902 --> 00:16:25,771
Just paying it back, that's all.

118
00:16:25,804 --> 00:16:29,008
You and Owen were a couple
godsends when Shelly passed.

119
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:30,409
Thank you.

120
00:16:35,215 --> 00:16:37,317
You want me to haul
that thing away?

121
00:16:37,349 --> 00:16:40,053
You just say the word.

122
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:42,021
It's okay.
I think I'll leave it.

123
00:16:42,055 --> 00:16:44,257
Sell it with the house.

124
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,025
You thinking
about selling?

125
00:16:46,993 --> 00:16:48,527
Maybe.

126
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,597
I mean, he built it,
so I'd hate to leave it, but...

127
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:54,499
Yeah.

128
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:57,502
It's peaceful out here,
but it is lonely.

129
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:03,343
Hey, Mel, were you, uh,
shooting this morning

130
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,711
around 7:30 or so?

131
00:17:05,744 --> 00:17:08,081
Didn't hear anything?
There was a gunshot.

132
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:10,849
I just figured with
the weather getting warmer

133
00:17:10,884 --> 00:17:12,886
and snakes and all...

134
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:14,354
I see a copperhead
near the house,

135
00:17:14,386 --> 00:17:15,955
I'm sure gonna shoot it,
but I didn't today.

136
00:17:16,256 --> 00:17:17,422
Right.

137
00:17:17,456 --> 00:17:20,525
You hear it again,
just give me a shout, okay?

138
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,527
- Okay, I will.
- Okay.

139
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:24,429
- I'm gonna get back.
- Mm-hmm.

140
00:17:32,171 --> 00:17:36,575
<i>So, this is going to be
the office down here,</i>

141
00:17:36,608 --> 00:17:38,777
<i>and over here
will be the kitchen.</i>

142
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,180
<i>Or maybe it's here.</i>

143
00:17:41,214 --> 00:17:44,284
<i>And then...
And then over here we have,</i>

144
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:45,584
<i>uh...</i>

145
00:17:45,617 --> 00:17:49,421
<i>...biceps. Lots of biceps.</i>

146
00:17:50,056 --> 00:17:51,757
<i>So, that is the husband.</i>

147
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,960
<i>Oh, hey, Owen!
How are you doing?</i>

148
00:17:53,993 --> 00:17:55,995
<i>Are you working?</i>

149
00:17:56,029 --> 00:17:58,530
<i>You know that we're paying
people to do that, right?</i>

150
00:17:58,563 --> 00:18:00,266
<i>You don't have to
do it all yourself.</i>

151
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,667
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

152
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,769
<i>No, no, don't worry,
I'm not actually filming.</i>

153
00:18:03,802 --> 00:18:05,537
- <i>Mm-hmm?</i>
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

154
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,506
<i>Well,
unless you want me to.</i>

155
00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:09,976
<i>Let me check.</i>

156
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:11,411
<i>No. Stop.</i>

157
00:18:11,443 --> 00:18:13,146
<i>Come here.</i>

158
00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:12,245
Who is this?

159
00:23:17,183 --> 00:23:18,584
<i>Beth...</i>

160
00:23:18,618 --> 00:23:20,987
Owen? Is...

161
00:23:22,521 --> 00:23:23,822
<i>I know that you can...</i>

162
00:23:23,856 --> 00:23:27,093
I can't hear you.
I can't...

163
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:30,229
<i>Yes, you can.</i>

164
00:23:30,263 --> 00:23:32,431
<i>Look out the window.</i>

165
00:26:17,763 --> 00:26:19,565
What am I looking at?

166
00:26:19,598 --> 00:26:21,868
You tell me.

167
00:26:21,902 --> 00:26:24,804
It's a picture of you.

168
00:26:24,837 --> 00:26:25,872
Is it?

169
00:26:25,906 --> 00:26:27,373
Yeah.

170
00:26:27,406 --> 00:26:30,042
I mean, nice blouse.

171
00:26:33,512 --> 00:26:34,647
Look... Look closer.

172
00:26:36,982 --> 00:26:38,250
Is that me?

173
00:26:38,284 --> 00:26:40,753
Yeah, I think so.
I mean, who else would it be?

174
00:26:40,786 --> 00:26:42,889
That's what
I want to know.

175
00:26:42,923 --> 00:26:45,157
Well, it's either you
or a woman who looks,

176
00:26:45,191 --> 00:26:47,259
like, a lot like you.

177
00:26:47,293 --> 00:26:50,229
Sweetie,
I think that's you.

178
00:26:50,262 --> 00:26:53,532
Nice blouse, right?
I don't have one like that.

179
00:26:53,566 --> 00:26:55,201
God, Beth.

180
00:26:55,234 --> 00:26:57,369
Don't do this to yourself.

181
00:26:57,904 --> 00:27:00,039
It's you, okay?

182
00:27:00,072 --> 00:27:02,775
And if it's not you,
then, believe me,

183
00:27:02,808 --> 00:27:05,077
there are far worse things to
find on your husband's phone

184
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,247
than fully clothed women
who look exactly like you.

185
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,984
Mm. Yeah, well,
I guess I was his type.

186
00:27:12,017 --> 00:27:14,620
Please. Owen loved you.

187
00:27:14,653 --> 00:27:17,189
You. He worshipped you.

188
00:27:17,223 --> 00:27:18,290
I...

189
00:27:18,324 --> 00:27:19,558
I mean, from everything
you told me,

190
00:27:19,592 --> 00:27:22,261
you didn't really give him
any reason to roam.

191
00:27:22,294 --> 00:27:25,130
I mean, how do you know he even
took those pictures anyway?

192
00:27:25,164 --> 00:27:27,766
He's not here to defend
himself or explain.

193
00:27:29,435 --> 00:27:31,237
Look, a bunch of us are
going out tonight drinking.

194
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,305
The whole department.
Well, not Clark, obviously,

195
00:27:33,339 --> 00:27:37,243
but you should come.
Get your mind off things.

196
00:27:37,276 --> 00:27:38,444
We'll see.

197
00:27:40,212 --> 00:27:42,448
Why were you going through
his phone anyway?

198
00:27:44,617 --> 00:27:45,784
Shit.

199
00:27:46,552 --> 00:27:47,954
Sorry.

200
00:27:47,988 --> 00:27:50,589
That was... That was
a really fucking stupid,

201
00:27:50,623 --> 00:27:52,358
insensitive thing to say.

202
00:27:55,027 --> 00:27:56,562
I'm sorry.

203
00:27:57,263 --> 00:27:59,298
I didn't think we had secrets.

204
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:04,103
Everybody has secrets.

205
00:28:04,136 --> 00:28:05,571
Don't let it weigh on you.

206
00:28:06,006 --> 00:28:07,606
Just...

207
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,708
Just remember
your Owen.

208
00:28:09,742 --> 00:28:12,378
Who you fell
in love with.

209
00:28:12,411 --> 00:28:15,681
Because whatever else he was,
he was that, too.

210
00:28:21,086 --> 00:28:22,121
<i>What's her name?</i>

211
00:28:22,154 --> 00:28:23,422
Maggie Monroe.

212
00:28:23,455 --> 00:28:25,224
Oh, she'd be
my best customer.

213
00:28:25,257 --> 00:28:28,060
She told me I don't have a
knack for teaching anyway.

214
00:28:28,093 --> 00:28:29,295
And she'd know

215
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:31,764
'cause she's an expert
on many things.

216
00:28:31,797 --> 00:28:33,532
Jesus Christ.

217
00:28:33,566 --> 00:28:36,702
So, are we going
to read the book she gave us?

218
00:28:36,735 --> 00:28:39,906
Fuck, no. I don't need
300 pages to tell me

219
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,474
how to "engage and inspire"
my students.

220
00:28:42,508 --> 00:28:45,912
Yeah, just let them stand up
on their desks or whatever.

221
00:28:45,946 --> 00:28:47,780
Change their lives.

222
00:28:50,984 --> 00:28:52,318
You okay, B?

223
00:28:56,221 --> 00:28:58,424
Do you guys
believe in ghosts?

224
00:29:00,326 --> 00:29:02,561
Uh...
Ghosts, like, how?

225
00:29:04,931 --> 00:29:07,132
I do. I believe.

226
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:08,667
- Really?
- Well, I mean, I don't not believe.

227
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:11,170
I think there's something
in my house.

228
00:29:11,905 --> 00:29:14,273
Like a... a presence.

229
00:29:14,807 --> 00:29:15,976
No way.

230
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:17,309
I mean,
I don't know.

231
00:29:17,343 --> 00:29:19,378
I feel like
there's something.

232
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:23,415
Like there's something
watching me.

233
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:27,119
And all this weird stuff.

234
00:29:27,152 --> 00:29:29,655
I'm having
these dreams.

235
00:29:29,688 --> 00:29:31,490
I mean, it feels like
they're dreams.

236
00:29:31,523 --> 00:29:33,093
They feel real though
when they're happening.

237
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,560
Like sleep paralysis?

238
00:29:35,394 --> 00:29:36,328
No.

239
00:29:36,362 --> 00:29:37,630
Do you know
what sleep paralysis is?

240
00:29:37,663 --> 00:29:39,465
Yes, Gary, I know
what sleep paralysis is.

241
00:29:39,498 --> 00:29:40,766
I don't.

242
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,402
It's when your mind's
awake, but your body's not, right?

243
00:29:43,435 --> 00:29:44,971
Did you guys see
that documentary on...

244
00:29:45,005 --> 00:29:46,639
I had this buddy
in school who had it.

245
00:29:46,672 --> 00:29:49,141
It's pretty common to feel like there's
someone else in the room with you

246
00:29:49,174 --> 00:29:50,676
when you're
having an episode.

247
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:52,311
Like a hostile presence.

248
00:29:52,344 --> 00:29:53,913
What about the opposite?

249
00:29:53,947 --> 00:29:55,115
Like a
friendly presence?

250
00:29:55,147 --> 00:29:56,715
No. When your body's awake,
but your mind isn't.

251
00:29:58,051 --> 00:30:00,053
But isn't that
just sleepwalking?

252
00:30:00,086 --> 00:30:02,254
Sure. Sleepwalking.

253
00:30:02,287 --> 00:30:03,857
Could that be contagious?

254
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,724
No. Why?

255
00:30:05,758 --> 00:30:07,292
Owen used to sleepwalk.

256
00:30:08,094 --> 00:30:10,562
I remember that.

257
00:30:10,596 --> 00:30:13,332
A year or two after he built the
house, it just started.

258
00:30:13,365 --> 00:30:14,633
Now you're doing it?

259
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:15,734
Yeah.

260
00:30:15,768 --> 00:30:16,802
That's weird.

261
00:30:21,007 --> 00:30:22,675
How long were you married?

262
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:23,943
Uh... Oh.

263
00:30:26,211 --> 00:30:27,413
Let me do the math.

264
00:30:28,814 --> 00:30:30,549
Fourteen years.

265
00:30:30,582 --> 00:30:33,585
This next one,
this next one would have been 15.

266
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:34,753
Wow.

267
00:30:34,787 --> 00:30:36,056
You were married young.

268
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:38,257
Little bit. Little bit.

269
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:40,359
I mean, you spend
so much time

270
00:30:40,392 --> 00:30:42,628
in the same space
with someone,

271
00:30:42,661 --> 00:30:44,864
it's gonna feel like
they're there.

272
00:30:44,898 --> 00:30:46,331
Even when they're not.

273
00:30:46,365 --> 00:30:48,101
But who knows, right?
I mean, who's to say

274
00:30:48,134 --> 00:30:49,368
what happens once we

275
00:30:49,401 --> 00:30:52,072
"shuffle off this mortal coil,
what dreams may come"?

276
00:30:52,105 --> 00:30:53,940
No. No Shakespeare
until next fall.

277
00:30:53,973 --> 00:30:57,409
Are you really gonna cheer me
up with the suicide soliloquy?

278
00:30:58,111 --> 00:31:00,312
Fuck. Oh, my God.

279
00:31:00,345 --> 00:31:02,949
Oh, my God, I didn't...
I'm so sorry.

280
00:31:05,051 --> 00:31:06,853
I'm joking.

281
00:31:06,886 --> 00:31:08,387
I'm joking.

282
00:31:10,522 --> 00:31:11,824
You shouldn't be
joking about that.

283
00:31:11,858 --> 00:31:12,892
Heather...

284
00:31:12,926 --> 00:31:14,493
Oh...

285
00:31:14,526 --> 00:31:18,497
Did you seriously not know
that anything was wrong?

286
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,798
Gary!
Jesus, you guys...

287
00:31:19,832 --> 00:31:20,867
No, I don't mind.

288
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,869
No, I didn't know.

289
00:31:22,902 --> 00:31:25,972
I'm the one who struggled
with that stuff. Depression.

290
00:31:26,005 --> 00:31:27,840
Dark thoughts.

291
00:31:28,607 --> 00:31:30,910
He's the one that
kept them at bay.

292
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,879
Maybe it got to him.

293
00:31:32,912 --> 00:31:37,583
I don't know.
Maybe I infected him with my bullshit.

294
00:31:37,616 --> 00:31:38,784
No, no. It...

295
00:31:38,817 --> 00:31:40,920
- It doesn't work like that.
- No?

296
00:31:47,793 --> 00:31:49,095
Did he leave a note?

297
00:31:49,129 --> 00:31:50,462
Okay.

298
00:31:50,496 --> 00:31:52,765
- I'm sorry.
- She wants to talk about it.

299
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:54,934
I think we're done
with this conversation.

300
00:31:54,968 --> 00:31:56,169
He did.

301
00:31:56,202 --> 00:31:57,469
Beth...

302
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,707
He did.

303
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,741
God.

304
00:32:13,352 --> 00:32:15,621
You keep it in your purse?

305
00:32:18,423 --> 00:32:20,026
Okay.

306
00:32:31,171 --> 00:32:32,771
"You were right.

307
00:32:34,174 --> 00:32:36,508
"There is nothing.

308
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,512
"Nothing is after you.

309
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,651
"You're safe now."

310
00:32:48,821 --> 00:32:49,822
That's it.

311
00:32:50,957 --> 00:32:51,991
That's it?

312
00:32:52,025 --> 00:32:53,226
That's it.

313
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:57,163
No "XOXO,
your loving husband."

314
00:32:57,197 --> 00:32:58,898
Nothing.

315
00:32:58,932 --> 00:33:00,300
What does that mean?

316
00:33:00,332 --> 00:33:01,834
Not a clue.
Not a fucking clue.

317
00:33:01,868 --> 00:33:03,769
Other than I was living
with a crazy person

318
00:33:03,802 --> 00:33:04,803
and didn't know it.

319
00:33:04,837 --> 00:33:06,672
Makes you wonder though,
doesn't it?

320
00:33:06,705 --> 00:33:08,740
What else didn't I know?

321
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:10,910
I want to know.

322
00:33:10,944 --> 00:33:13,445
Okay. I think that it's
time we get you home.

323
00:33:13,478 --> 00:33:17,616
Sure. I mean,
I wouldn't wanna keep him waiting.

324
00:33:18,251 --> 00:33:19,953
Okay.

325
00:33:19,986 --> 00:33:21,020
Let's go.

326
00:33:21,054 --> 00:33:22,588
Okay, fine, let's go.

327
00:33:22,621 --> 00:33:24,656
Good night, guys.
Thank you.

328
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:27,359
- Okay.
- Let's go. I got you.

329
00:33:37,569 --> 00:33:40,273
Wow, you've really made
some progress on the place.

330
00:33:40,306 --> 00:33:41,506
Mm-hmm.

331
00:33:44,277 --> 00:33:45,477
You want a brandy?

332
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:48,647
No, Beth.
I don't want a brandy.

333
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,084
- And I don't want you to have one either.
- Okay.

334
00:33:52,085 --> 00:33:53,719
I don't even
like it that much.

335
00:33:53,752 --> 00:33:55,855
Haven't acquired
the taste.

336
00:34:00,492 --> 00:34:03,096
Come on,
upstairs with you.

337
00:34:03,129 --> 00:34:06,431
No. I'm sleeping here.

338
00:34:09,468 --> 00:34:11,971
Okay. Do you
want me to stay?

339
00:34:12,571 --> 00:34:16,541
Mm-mm. You've got kids.

340
00:34:16,575 --> 00:34:19,012
It's fine.
I could just...

341
00:34:20,412 --> 00:34:22,348
I can call Bob.
I told him I was gonna be out late.

342
00:34:22,382 --> 00:34:24,449
I could just
call him and...

343
00:34:25,218 --> 00:34:26,986
No. Mm-mm.

344
00:34:29,355 --> 00:34:32,926
Well, you should
come over soon.

345
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:35,727
For dinner or something.
I'll get Bob to cook for us.

346
00:34:36,728 --> 00:34:40,233
I don't like you here
all by yourself.

347
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:51,177
I lied.

348
00:34:55,315 --> 00:34:57,549
About the letter.

349
00:34:57,582 --> 00:35:01,720
You asshole!
Oh, my God!

350
00:35:01,753 --> 00:35:05,258
Oh, my God, you totally has us going.
I thought that was real.

351
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:06,960
Did you see Gary's face?

352
00:35:06,993 --> 00:35:08,094
It is real.

353
00:35:08,127 --> 00:35:10,629
I meant that I lied about
having no idea what it meant.

354
00:35:16,402 --> 00:35:17,937
You know, I...

355
00:35:17,971 --> 00:35:22,507
I died back in Tennessee.
Did I tell you that story?

356
00:35:23,742 --> 00:35:25,411
Mm-mm.

357
00:35:25,445 --> 00:35:27,046
Seventeen, high school.

358
00:35:27,713 --> 00:35:29,415
Friend was driving,

359
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:33,052
and we flipped
over the side of a mountain.

360
00:35:35,355 --> 00:35:37,190
Pancaked.

361
00:35:39,058 --> 00:35:42,962
Lungs were crushed.
They had to airlift me out.

362
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:47,799
Heart stopped.
Whole deal. Four minutes.

363
00:35:48,234 --> 00:35:49,902
Oh, my God.

364
00:35:51,304 --> 00:35:57,343
Afterward, when everyone would
ask me when they found out,

365
00:35:57,377 --> 00:36:01,047
like, "What was it like?
What did you see?"

366
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:07,053
And I didn't want to disappoint
them, so I'd say...

367
00:36:08,787 --> 00:36:10,689
"I don't know.
I don't remember."

368
00:36:14,961 --> 00:36:16,628
But I remember.

369
00:36:17,497 --> 00:36:20,299
Owen was the only person
I ever told.

370
00:36:21,067 --> 00:36:22,969
There's nothing.

371
00:36:25,371 --> 00:36:29,008
What do you mean,
"Nothing"?

372
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:32,879
I wish I could
tell you something.

373
00:36:32,912 --> 00:36:36,182
A light at the end
of the tunnel.

374
00:36:36,215 --> 00:36:38,184
There's just tunnel.

375
00:36:41,854 --> 00:36:45,757
If it's any consolation,
Owen was never convinced.

376
00:36:48,827 --> 00:36:53,299
Yeah, we agreed about
most things, but not that.

377
00:36:53,332 --> 00:36:56,701
Not what comes after.
He wanted to believe in a better place.

378
00:36:57,669 --> 00:37:00,206
And he almost
made me believe it, too.

379
00:37:02,508 --> 00:37:05,344
But you can't unknow
what you know.

380
00:37:07,779 --> 00:37:12,351
"You were right.
There is nothing.

381
00:37:14,454 --> 00:37:16,755
"Nothing is after you.

382
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,193
"You're safe now."

383
00:37:23,129 --> 00:37:25,131
He told me I was right.

384
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:30,036
Now I'm not so sure.

385
00:37:31,971 --> 00:37:36,675
He said you were safe.
Safe from what?

386
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:39,278
I guess we'll never know,
will we, Claire?

387
00:37:42,747 --> 00:37:44,984
Do you
really believe in ghosts?

388
00:37:45,017 --> 00:37:48,221
No.
I was just being nice.

389
00:37:49,122 --> 00:37:50,890
Mm.

390
00:37:50,923 --> 00:37:55,228
You are.
You're very, very nice.

391
00:37:57,864 --> 00:37:59,798
Sure you don't
want me to stay?

392
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:03,936
Maybe just till I go to sleep.

393
00:38:09,509 --> 00:38:11,944
<i>Beth.</i>

394
00:38:13,745 --> 00:38:15,615
<i>Beth. Wake up.</i>

395
00:38:15,647 --> 00:38:16,949
<i>The door.</i>

396
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:21,320
<i>Beth, wake up.</i>

397
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,661
Claire?

398
00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:31,830
<i>The door.</i>

399
00:38:37,937 --> 00:38:40,439
You wanna say something?
Talk to me!

400
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:29,655
Hey!

401
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,226
Hey! Hey!

402
00:39:36,028 --> 00:39:37,363
Hey!

403
00:39:50,509 --> 00:39:52,378
What?

404
00:39:58,417 --> 00:40:01,287
Wait! No! No!

405
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:15,701
<i>The boat.</i>

406
00:40:15,735 --> 00:40:18,237
What did you say?

407
00:40:22,807 --> 00:40:24,010
<i>The boat.</i>

408
00:41:23,736 --> 00:41:25,404
Owen?

409
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,075
Are you really here?

410
00:41:45,057 --> 00:41:46,926
If you're with me, show me.

411
00:42:05,511 --> 00:42:07,179
Is that really you?

412
00:44:30,055 --> 00:44:31,457
<i>It's a dream.</i>

413
00:44:33,826 --> 00:44:35,394
<i>You're dreaming.</i>

414
00:48:12,145 --> 00:48:13,779
Beth?

415
00:48:14,114 --> 00:48:15,414
Hey.

416
00:48:15,447 --> 00:48:18,450
What are you doing out here?
Taking a hike?

417
00:48:18,484 --> 00:48:22,088
Uh, no. No,
I'm just looking for something.

418
00:48:22,122 --> 00:48:23,555
Can I help?

419
00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:24,690
Uh-uh.

420
00:48:25,824 --> 00:48:27,693
What you looking for?

421
00:48:27,726 --> 00:48:29,261
Uh... A house.

422
00:48:30,096 --> 00:48:32,464
- A house?
- Mm-hmm.

423
00:48:32,498 --> 00:48:35,168
No houses out here.
It's all county forest land.

424
00:48:35,201 --> 00:48:36,936
Can't build on it.

425
00:48:38,905 --> 00:48:39,906
Right. I'm just being silly.

426
00:48:39,939 --> 00:48:43,642
I thought I saw something
last night, like a...

427
00:48:43,675 --> 00:48:46,880
Looked like a light
in a window, so...

428
00:48:47,713 --> 00:48:49,149
A house?

429
00:48:49,182 --> 00:48:50,482
Mm-hmm.

430
00:48:52,518 --> 00:48:55,387
Anyway, it's doing me good
to get some air.

431
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,756
So, if you don't mind...

432
00:48:58,624 --> 00:49:00,359
As a matter of fact,
I do.

433
00:49:01,928 --> 00:49:03,729
Sorry, what?

434
00:49:04,964 --> 00:49:07,033
You're not well, Beth.

435
00:49:07,066 --> 00:49:08,868
You've been through a lot lately.
More than you deserve.

436
00:49:08,902 --> 00:49:10,736
And for my own peace of
mind, if nothing else,

437
00:49:10,769 --> 00:49:15,607
I'd rather not have you tromping around
out here in the woods on your own.

438
00:49:15,641 --> 00:49:17,877
You should be with your
friends and family.

439
00:49:18,844 --> 00:49:20,479
Do you have anybody?

440
00:49:22,681 --> 00:49:25,919
Hey. How about
my place for lunch?

441
00:49:25,952 --> 00:49:29,289
- I'll make sandwiches.
- Mm-hmm.

442
00:49:29,321 --> 00:49:31,423
Yeah, that sounds nice.

443
00:49:32,457 --> 00:49:34,861
Maybe in a little while
though, okay?

444
00:51:31,911 --> 00:51:33,445
Anyone here?

445
00:53:03,802 --> 00:53:04,803
Mel?

446
00:53:08,408 --> 00:53:09,608
Mel?

447
00:53:10,209 --> 00:53:11,244
Hold on!

448
00:53:12,512 --> 00:53:13,845
Okay.

449
00:53:15,847 --> 00:53:18,051
- What the fuck is this?
- What?

450
00:53:18,084 --> 00:53:20,053
What the fuck is this?

451
00:53:20,086 --> 00:53:21,154
How should I know?

452
00:53:21,187 --> 00:53:22,788
Bullshit. You were trying to
keep me out of the woods.

453
00:53:22,821 --> 00:53:24,290
Because I'm worried
about you.

454
00:53:24,323 --> 00:53:26,392
- What was he building?
- What?

455
00:53:26,426 --> 00:53:28,961
There is a house.
Our house. My house.

456
00:53:28,995 --> 00:53:30,897
Now, what the fuck
was he building?

457
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:33,099
I don't know.
I never saw a house.

458
00:53:33,132 --> 00:53:34,867
I only saw him wandering
around out there

459
00:53:34,901 --> 00:53:36,701
in the middle of the night
from time to time.

460
00:53:36,735 --> 00:53:39,272
What? And you
didn't tell me?

461
00:53:41,441 --> 00:53:43,342
He asked me not to.

462
00:53:45,644 --> 00:53:46,879
Mel.

463
00:53:46,913 --> 00:53:48,747
Look, Beth...

464
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:51,250
I don't think you're equipped
to handle this right now.

465
00:53:52,919 --> 00:53:54,653
Oh.

466
00:53:56,055 --> 00:53:58,690
Tell me everything
that you know.

467
00:54:03,628 --> 00:54:05,697
I caught him once.

468
00:54:07,366 --> 00:54:09,701
Like I caught you
this morning.

469
00:54:09,734 --> 00:54:12,939
Taking that same route
around the lake.

470
00:54:17,376 --> 00:54:19,312
He had a woman with him.

471
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,917
I thought it was you, so I called
out, and when she turned...

472
00:54:25,451 --> 00:54:26,486
It wasn't.

473
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:27,786
No.

474
00:54:28,855 --> 00:54:30,789
He came by that night.

475
00:54:30,822 --> 00:54:33,493
Pounding at my door. Late.

476
00:54:33,526 --> 00:54:35,394
In a real bad way.

477
00:54:35,428 --> 00:54:39,298
Alcohol on his breath. Mud on his
hands and clothes, like he'd fallen.

478
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,602
And I know
how it sounds now,

479
00:54:42,634 --> 00:54:45,704
but I believed
every word he said.

480
00:54:45,737 --> 00:54:48,074
And? What did he say?

481
00:54:48,807 --> 00:54:51,010
That he had urges.

482
00:54:53,179 --> 00:54:55,214
Shameful urges...

483
00:54:57,049 --> 00:55:00,186
that he was rightfully ashamed
of, that he was trying to shake.

484
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,756
Said he'd found a way
to keep them at bay.

485
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:09,462
What kind of urges?

486
00:55:09,495 --> 00:55:12,265
You'll forgive me if I
didn't feel the need to ask.

487
00:55:14,333 --> 00:55:18,404
Look. Don't think I haven't
wrestled with this, okay?

488
00:55:18,437 --> 00:55:19,972
But I swear
on Shelly's grave

489
00:55:20,006 --> 00:55:22,841
that I never saw anything
like that again. Ever.

490
00:55:22,875 --> 00:55:24,911
I wanted to tell you
so many times...

491
00:55:28,948 --> 00:55:31,050
but he just seemed
good after that.

492
00:55:31,083 --> 00:55:34,253
You both seemed so good.

493
00:55:34,287 --> 00:55:36,055
Well, I guess you were wrong.

494
00:55:36,088 --> 00:55:37,523
He left a hole
in your life

495
00:55:37,557 --> 00:55:40,326
and you're desperate to fill it.
That's what this is.

496
00:55:42,028 --> 00:55:43,996
Look, if...

497
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:52,004
All I can say is that,
if I'm allowed to say anything,

498
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:58,945
is that you don't need to
fill it with something dark.

499
00:55:58,978 --> 00:56:02,281
You're closer to death
than you've ever been.

500
00:56:03,115 --> 00:56:05,384
Well, that's not
exactly true.

501
00:58:52,418 --> 00:58:53,886
Okay.

502
01:00:33,486 --> 01:00:35,087
Come back.

503
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,089
Come back...

504
01:01:34,547 --> 01:01:35,614
Just one sec.

505
01:01:39,385 --> 01:01:41,820
I'm not actually buying these.
I just have a quick question.

506
01:01:41,855 --> 01:01:43,255
Uh, my husband
bought these from you,

507
01:01:43,289 --> 01:01:44,925
and I'm just wondering
if you could tell me

508
01:01:44,958 --> 01:01:46,292
whether he bought
anything else,

509
01:01:46,325 --> 01:01:50,030
or whether he had something on hold?
Something like that?

510
01:01:50,062 --> 01:01:52,264
Um, we don't really
keep records like that.

511
01:01:53,232 --> 01:01:55,801
Okay. Could you
tell me when?

512
01:01:55,834 --> 01:01:57,403
When he bought these?

513
01:01:57,436 --> 01:01:58,939
Maybe you have
an inventory?

514
01:01:58,972 --> 01:02:00,639
- Not like that.
- Right.

515
01:02:00,673 --> 01:02:03,375
Could you tell me other books
by this author?

516
01:02:05,477 --> 01:02:06,812
Tsk.

517
01:02:06,845 --> 01:02:08,647
Let's see...

518
01:02:08,681 --> 01:02:09,682
It's Dyson.

519
01:02:10,749 --> 01:02:14,253
Think you probably want
Sturgis, but okay...

520
01:02:59,531 --> 01:03:00,766
Hi.

521
01:03:01,567 --> 01:03:03,168
Hi.

522
01:03:03,202 --> 01:03:04,871
You work here?

523
01:03:04,904 --> 01:03:07,406
I do. Can I help you
with anything?

524
01:03:07,439 --> 01:03:08,741
Mm-mm.

525
01:03:12,078 --> 01:03:13,312
I'm Beth.

526
01:03:14,914 --> 01:03:16,649
Beth Parchin.

527
01:03:17,616 --> 01:03:19,351
Madelyne.

528
01:03:20,352 --> 01:03:22,688
I think
you knew my husband.

529
01:03:23,622 --> 01:03:26,625
- No, I don't...
- Owen. Owen Parchin.

530
01:03:28,327 --> 01:03:31,397
There are pictures
of you on his phone.

531
01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:34,800
Jonah?

532
01:03:34,833 --> 01:03:36,903
It's all right. You don't
have to call for help.

533
01:03:36,936 --> 01:03:39,805
I'm not gonna...

534
01:03:41,007 --> 01:03:42,241
I mean...

535
01:03:44,044 --> 01:03:46,980
the matter's been resolved...

536
01:03:47,013 --> 01:03:48,882
I guess.

537
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:53,119
- Oh.
- Yeah.

538
01:03:53,153 --> 01:03:54,453
He's dead.

539
01:03:55,788 --> 01:03:57,256
What?

540
01:03:57,289 --> 01:03:58,925
Suicide.

541
01:04:00,192 --> 01:04:02,327
Oh, my God.

542
01:04:02,361 --> 01:04:05,664
Just in case you had
any dates planned, or...

543
01:04:05,965 --> 01:04:07,100
Mm-mm.

544
01:04:07,133 --> 01:04:09,869
- It wasn't like that.
- Oh.

545
01:04:09,903 --> 01:04:13,305
Well, then would you mind
telling me what it was like?

546
01:04:15,808 --> 01:04:17,576
Sure. Um...

547
01:04:18,945 --> 01:04:23,282
He came in
a few times every year,

548
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:26,819
and he was always friendly.

549
01:04:26,852 --> 01:04:31,724
We flirted some,
and he started coming more after that.

550
01:04:31,757 --> 01:04:34,861
We had a few drinks,
and that was it.

551
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:38,464
Take your hair down.

552
01:04:38,497 --> 01:04:41,266
- What?
- Your hair. Ponytail.

553
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:43,502
Lose it. Take it down.

554
01:04:43,535 --> 01:04:44,938
Why?

555
01:04:44,971 --> 01:04:47,306
Well, because you slept with my
husband, and I'm asking you nicely.

556
01:04:47,806 --> 01:04:48,807
I didn't...

557
01:05:12,899 --> 01:05:14,633
I didn't sleep
with him.

558
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,004
Honestly, I barely knew him.

559
01:05:20,339 --> 01:05:21,840
<i>For centuries,
stories of the...</i>

560
01:05:21,875 --> 01:05:24,376
She said she barely
fucking knew him.

561
01:05:24,409 --> 01:05:25,511
What did you say?

562
01:05:25,544 --> 01:05:28,982
Same. I said,
"Same here, kid."

563
01:05:30,482 --> 01:05:31,583
Do you believe her?

564
01:05:31,617 --> 01:05:33,585
What? About them
not fucking?

565
01:05:33,619 --> 01:05:34,820
Yeah.

566
01:05:34,853 --> 01:05:36,421
I do.

567
01:05:36,455 --> 01:05:38,091
Well, that's something.

568
01:05:38,124 --> 01:05:39,591
Nothing good.

569
01:05:39,625 --> 01:05:43,562
I mean, fucking, I get.
Fucking makes sense.

570
01:05:44,663 --> 01:05:47,934
There were others.
Our neighbor saw him with someone.

571
01:05:47,967 --> 01:05:48,801
Really?

572
01:05:48,834 --> 01:05:50,469
Yes. And I looked
on his computer,

573
01:05:50,502 --> 01:05:52,337
and there are
tons of pictures,

574
01:05:52,371 --> 01:05:53,705
like half a dozen women.

575
01:05:53,739 --> 01:05:56,009
They all look a little bit like
me, but not quite.

576
01:05:56,042 --> 01:05:57,977
So if he wasn't
fucking them,

577
01:05:58,011 --> 01:05:59,946
what the hell
was he doing?

578
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:04,284
I had this dream
the other night.

579
01:06:04,316 --> 01:06:07,120
It was our house, but not.

580
01:06:07,153 --> 01:06:09,122
It was backwards,

581
01:06:09,155 --> 01:06:10,389
and I saw him
with someone...

582
01:06:10,422 --> 01:06:13,092
Stop. Stop it.

583
01:06:13,126 --> 01:06:15,494
Stop going
through his stuff.

584
01:06:15,527 --> 01:06:17,563
Nothing you find
is gonna help you right now.

585
01:06:17,596 --> 01:06:20,499
Am I not being clear?
He had a secret life.

586
01:06:20,532 --> 01:06:22,768
Are you really gonna
stand there and lecture me

587
01:06:22,801 --> 01:06:25,737
about his posthumous right
to privacy?

588
01:06:27,406 --> 01:06:31,476
I understand you're
experiencing these things,

589
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:33,478
but I'm worried
about you.

590
01:06:33,512 --> 01:06:36,115
Maybe take a step back.

591
01:06:39,185 --> 01:06:41,453
I don't know.

592
01:06:50,429 --> 01:06:52,598
I felt him.

593
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:56,035
I felt my husband.

594
01:07:00,672 --> 01:07:03,475
"You were right.
There's nothing."

595
01:07:04,944 --> 01:07:08,680
Why would he say there's nothing?
He didn't believe that.

596
01:07:09,983 --> 01:07:11,783
Beliefs change.

597
01:07:12,417 --> 01:07:14,386
Look at you.

598
01:07:14,419 --> 01:07:15,855
You're the most
skeptical person I know,

599
01:07:15,889 --> 01:07:18,657
and here you are,
telling me that your house is haunted.

600
01:07:28,767 --> 01:07:31,237
Yeah, I mean,
when you put it like that,

601
01:07:31,271 --> 01:07:33,472
it does sound kinda silly.

602
01:07:33,505 --> 01:07:35,807
Don't go home.

603
01:07:35,841 --> 01:07:37,442
Get away from the lake
for a while.

604
01:07:38,044 --> 01:07:40,346
You can
stay here, even.

605
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:42,982
You can stay
as long as you want.

606
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:45,952
It's not finished.

607
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,890
Not everything gets finished.

608
01:07:50,924 --> 01:07:53,960
You may never know
what he was thinking.

609
01:07:55,261 --> 01:07:58,463
He's gone.
You're not.

610
01:08:00,632 --> 01:08:03,169
You still have a life to live.

611
01:08:07,974 --> 01:08:10,343
No, you're right.

612
01:08:10,376 --> 01:08:13,112
I could use the distance.

613
01:08:13,146 --> 01:08:15,915
I'll go pack a few more things.
Get a bag.

614
01:08:15,949 --> 01:08:19,152
Book into a room
for a couple nights.

615
01:08:19,185 --> 01:08:22,855
- I can't tell if you're being serious.
- I am.

616
01:08:22,889 --> 01:08:26,825
And you've made some
excellent points. Really.

617
01:08:28,061 --> 01:08:30,096
I love you.

618
01:08:34,633 --> 01:08:36,402
Just call me later, okay?

619
01:08:36,436 --> 01:08:38,071
I will.

620
01:09:17,642 --> 01:09:19,312
I'm leaving.

621
01:09:19,345 --> 01:09:22,281
Tonight, I guess.

622
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:27,719
So, if you've got something to say to
me, you better say it now.

623
01:09:32,992 --> 01:09:34,861
You hear me?

624
01:09:41,666 --> 01:09:44,470
Motherfucker.

625
01:10:03,322 --> 01:10:04,323
Hey!

626
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:11,696
Sorry.
I didn't think you were home.

627
01:10:12,398 --> 01:10:13,900
I'm home.

628
01:10:15,401 --> 01:10:17,470
I don't think
I should be here.

629
01:10:17,503 --> 01:10:19,738
How did you know
where to go?

630
01:10:19,771 --> 01:10:23,076
Well, I've been here before.

631
01:10:32,818 --> 01:10:35,821
I probably should have told
you earlier at the bookstore,

632
01:10:35,855 --> 01:10:38,958
but, uh, honestly,
you freaked me out a little.

633
01:10:39,624 --> 01:10:41,593
Sorry about that.

634
01:10:42,694 --> 01:10:45,865
No, I get it. Totally.

635
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:51,204
I probably would have
done the same thing.

636
01:10:52,105 --> 01:10:53,873
It's funny, really,

637
01:10:53,906 --> 01:10:55,607
I laid down for a
minute after work,

638
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:59,145
and I had this dream.

639
01:10:59,711 --> 01:11:01,813
I dreamed I was you.

640
01:11:01,847 --> 01:11:04,984
Well, I was me,
but I was you, too,

641
01:11:05,017 --> 01:11:08,888
and something was chasing you,
and it was all around you.

642
01:11:08,921 --> 01:11:10,089
Well, us.

643
01:11:10,123 --> 01:11:13,159
But did it get us?

644
01:11:13,192 --> 01:11:16,329
I'm not sure.
That's when I woke up.

645
01:11:17,463 --> 01:11:20,233
Afterwards,
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

646
01:11:21,666 --> 01:11:24,971
I figured there's something
you should know.

647
01:11:25,905 --> 01:11:28,673
- Stuff that happened.
- Phew.

648
01:11:32,612 --> 01:11:34,813
I told you I didn't sleep
with your husband.

649
01:11:34,846 --> 01:11:38,317
Yeah, you can use his name.
He wasn't "my husband" to you.

650
01:11:38,351 --> 01:11:39,684
Right.

651
01:11:40,553 --> 01:11:42,321
Well, I meant it.

652
01:11:43,222 --> 01:11:45,324
I didn't sleep with him.

653
01:11:45,358 --> 01:11:50,263
But I would have.
I thought we would, but...

654
01:11:50,296 --> 01:11:52,831
He came by one afternoon

655
01:11:52,865 --> 01:11:54,666
after I was getting off,

656
01:11:54,699 --> 01:11:58,204
and he invited me here,
like a... like a day trip.

657
01:11:58,237 --> 01:11:59,939
And normally,
I wouldn't have gone,

658
01:11:59,972 --> 01:12:03,576
but he was smart,
and sweet, and...

659
01:12:03,609 --> 01:12:08,414
I don't know. I just kind of
felt safe with him, you know?

660
01:12:08,915 --> 01:12:10,249
I do.

661
01:12:10,283 --> 01:12:11,716
Right.

662
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:14,921
So, yeah, um,
he took me here

663
01:12:14,954 --> 01:12:18,157
and, uh, we had a drink.

664
01:12:18,191 --> 01:12:21,360
We walked to the lake,
and he showed me the other house...

665
01:12:21,394 --> 01:12:24,230
Wait. You've seen it?

666
01:12:24,263 --> 01:12:28,401
Well, it's not much to see,
but he was really proud of it, though.

667
01:12:28,434 --> 01:12:29,801
I mean, giddy, almost.

668
01:12:29,834 --> 01:12:32,138
Showing me around
from room to room.

669
01:12:32,171 --> 01:12:36,409
And then, he showed me this weird
statue, and he asked me to hold it.

670
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:39,478
And you did?

671
01:12:41,414 --> 01:12:44,350
What exactly did he
do to you?

672
01:12:49,222 --> 01:12:50,789
Nothing.

673
01:12:52,824 --> 01:12:54,826
He held me...

674
01:12:55,695 --> 01:12:57,129
sort of.

675
01:12:57,163 --> 01:13:02,201
He put his chin
on my shoulder and...

676
01:13:02,235 --> 01:13:05,238
Look, I know it sounds weird
saying it out loud,

677
01:13:05,271 --> 01:13:06,838
but at the time,

678
01:13:06,872 --> 01:13:09,108
it felt really nice.

679
01:13:09,141 --> 01:13:12,945
Having someone
close to you.

680
01:13:12,979 --> 01:13:15,147
Feeling them there.

681
01:13:16,482 --> 01:13:17,849
I...

682
01:13:17,883 --> 01:13:19,552
I felt him shake.

683
01:13:19,585 --> 01:13:24,390
And he was crying a little,
and I didn't know what to do.

684
01:13:24,423 --> 01:13:26,259
What did he do to you?

685
01:13:26,292 --> 01:13:30,829
I kissed him.
He kissed me back and...

686
01:13:31,731 --> 01:13:34,200
It was very sweet at first.

687
01:13:36,202 --> 01:13:37,903
So, I... I...

688
01:13:39,472 --> 01:13:42,774
didn't stop him when he
put his hands on my back.

689
01:13:44,343 --> 01:13:47,346
And I didn't stop him when
he put his hands on my neck.

690
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:50,716
Until he
started squeezing.

691
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:53,419
Oh, my God.

692
01:13:53,452 --> 01:13:56,389
I probably misread him,
you know? I just...

693
01:13:56,422 --> 01:13:59,892
Everybody has a different
barometer for that kind of thing.

694
01:13:59,925 --> 01:14:01,627
Did he hurt you?

695
01:14:01,661 --> 01:14:03,562
God, no!

696
01:14:03,596 --> 01:14:05,631
I asked him to stop,
and he stopped.

697
01:14:05,665 --> 01:14:07,400
But do you think
he would have?

698
01:14:07,433 --> 01:14:08,800
But he didn't.

699
01:14:08,833 --> 01:14:10,703
He drove me home.

700
01:14:10,736 --> 01:14:14,006
He said it was his fault,
not mine.

701
01:14:14,874 --> 01:14:17,076
That he was
tired and confused,

702
01:14:17,109 --> 01:14:19,811
and he didn't know
what was him,

703
01:14:19,844 --> 01:14:23,516
and it wasn't
working anymore.

704
01:14:24,684 --> 01:14:27,953
He was afraid
he couldn't hold it back.

705
01:14:27,987 --> 01:14:29,555
Hold what back?

706
01:14:29,588 --> 01:14:31,857
I don't know exactly.

707
01:14:31,891 --> 01:14:33,793
But in the end,

708
01:14:33,825 --> 01:14:36,595
he said he knew
what he had to do.

709
01:14:37,663 --> 01:14:40,333
He had to end it
for good.

710
01:14:42,868 --> 01:14:43,936
Look...

711
01:14:43,969 --> 01:14:45,137
I just wanted to tell you.

712
01:14:45,171 --> 01:14:48,007
He clearly felt guilty
about cheating on you.

713
01:14:51,744 --> 01:14:54,347
That's what he was
talking about, right?

714
01:16:18,597 --> 01:16:20,599
We need to talk.

715
01:16:22,968 --> 01:16:26,071
I'm not leaving until we do.

716
01:16:27,473 --> 01:16:31,610
You called, I came.

717
01:16:37,918 --> 01:16:41,020
Don't you wanna talk to me?

718
01:16:43,989 --> 01:16:46,425
You talked to her.

719
01:16:53,132 --> 01:16:57,536
I'm here. I'm still here.

720
01:16:58,771 --> 01:17:01,507
Wherever you are...

721
01:17:03,944 --> 01:17:06,078
come and get me.

722
01:17:15,754 --> 01:17:18,057
Just come get me!

723
01:17:27,766 --> 01:17:30,202
Okay.

724
01:18:17,850 --> 01:18:20,319
Fucking...

725
01:18:44,209 --> 01:18:46,845
Okay. Okay.
Come on, pick up the phone.

726
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:47,948
<i>Claire Woodward...</i>

727
01:18:47,981 --> 01:18:49,015
Fuck!

728
01:18:49,049 --> 01:18:50,149
<i>...is not available.
At the tone,</i>

729
01:18:50,182 --> 01:18:52,318
<i>please record your message.</i>

730
01:18:52,351 --> 01:18:56,121
I'm sorry.
Hey, it's, uh... it's late.

731
01:18:56,822 --> 01:18:58,424
And, uh...

732
01:18:59,291 --> 01:19:02,127
I should have listened to you.

733
01:19:02,161 --> 01:19:05,297
I did something
that I shouldn't have.

734
01:19:05,331 --> 01:19:08,300
I went across the lake,
and I saw something.

735
01:19:08,334 --> 01:19:10,169
I saw something so...

736
01:19:12,371 --> 01:19:14,840
I don't even know
if it's real or not.

737
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:20,880
I know my husband.

738
01:19:20,914 --> 01:19:23,716
I know who he is,

739
01:19:23,749 --> 01:19:27,786
and I refuse to believe
that he would have...

740
01:19:30,056 --> 01:19:32,424
I don't know.

741
01:19:35,394 --> 01:19:39,264
I wish that you were here.

742
01:19:41,767 --> 01:19:44,136
I wish that it were morning.

743
01:21:13,358 --> 01:21:15,594
No.

744
01:21:15,627 --> 01:21:17,496
Stop it.

745
01:21:22,835 --> 01:21:24,670
Owen?

746
01:21:37,483 --> 01:21:39,785
Where are you?

747
01:21:43,089 --> 01:21:45,158
I just...

748
01:21:45,191 --> 01:21:46,960
I don't understand.

749
01:21:48,061 --> 01:21:50,496
Please come back.

750
01:22:05,011 --> 01:22:07,046
Oh, God.

751
01:22:09,015 --> 01:22:12,651
I miss you so much.

752
01:24:39,098 --> 01:24:41,200
Is this real?

753
01:24:41,234 --> 01:24:42,701
Are you really here?

754
01:25:01,287 --> 01:25:03,588
Hold me. Hold me.

755
01:25:19,105 --> 01:25:20,639
You're really here?

756
01:25:22,175 --> 01:25:24,043
<i>Yes.</i>

757
01:25:29,182 --> 01:25:30,849
<i>I'm here.</i>

758
01:25:46,332 --> 01:25:47,867
Owen?

759
01:25:50,336 --> 01:25:52,038
<i>No.</i>

760
01:25:53,239 --> 01:25:55,674
<i>I'm not Owen.</i>

761
01:26:00,612 --> 01:26:02,848
Fuck. Fuck.

762
01:26:41,287 --> 01:26:43,256
No, stop it.

763
01:27:58,331 --> 01:27:59,365
Hide.

764
01:27:59,966 --> 01:28:00,967
What?

765
01:29:48,107 --> 01:29:49,308
Owen?

766
01:30:41,627 --> 01:30:43,195
You left.

767
01:30:44,497 --> 01:30:45,498
What?

768
01:30:47,667 --> 01:30:49,268
The night we met.

769
01:30:52,338 --> 01:30:54,106
You're not Owen.

770
01:30:55,741 --> 01:30:59,245
I'm what you felt
when your heart stopped.

771
01:31:00,513 --> 01:31:02,515
No. I felt...

772
01:31:02,548 --> 01:31:04,050
Nothing.

773
01:31:05,785 --> 01:31:07,887
Do you remember?

774
01:31:08,721 --> 01:31:10,589
You saw me.

775
01:31:10,623 --> 01:31:13,159
And I've been
with you ever since.

776
01:31:13,192 --> 01:31:15,827
What did you do
to my husband?

777
01:31:19,699 --> 01:31:21,500
<i>I went to him.</i>

778
01:31:22,935 --> 01:31:25,371
<i>I whispered in his ear</i>

779
01:31:25,404 --> 01:31:27,873
<i>over and over.</i>

780
01:31:29,508 --> 01:31:31,310
<i>To send you back.</i>

781
01:31:56,769 --> 01:31:58,037
But he wouldn't.

782
01:31:59,071 --> 01:32:01,407
He sent me them instead.

783
01:32:05,911 --> 01:32:07,646
He tricked you.

784
01:32:08,347 --> 01:32:10,049
For a while.

785
01:32:26,265 --> 01:32:27,266
Shit.

786
01:32:29,001 --> 01:32:30,236
<i>Stop.</i>

787
01:32:32,071 --> 01:32:34,373
<i>Don't fight.</i>

788
01:32:34,807 --> 01:32:36,075
No!

789
01:32:36,108 --> 01:32:38,210
<i>Beth.</i>

790
01:34:22,916 --> 01:34:24,450
Beth?

791
01:34:26,485 --> 01:34:27,686
Hello?

792
01:34:36,963 --> 01:34:38,697
Beth, are you here?

793
01:34:42,101 --> 01:34:44,036
I'm coming up.

794
01:34:53,345 --> 01:34:54,413
Beth?

795
01:34:55,748 --> 01:34:57,283
Beth!

796
01:36:09,956 --> 01:36:11,724
Where is he?

797
01:36:22,468 --> 01:36:23,903
Gone.

798
01:36:27,239 --> 01:36:29,508
But you already
knew that.

799
01:36:42,221 --> 01:36:43,857
What the fuck?

800
01:36:52,231 --> 01:36:53,432
Oh, my God.

801
01:36:55,902 --> 01:36:56,903
Beth!

802
01:37:23,529 --> 01:37:26,432
He thought
he could protect you.

803
01:37:27,599 --> 01:37:29,468
He was wrong.

804
01:37:30,369 --> 01:37:32,271
You were right.

805
01:37:42,916 --> 01:37:44,316
Beth!

806
01:37:46,218 --> 01:37:47,954
Beth!

807
01:37:54,259 --> 01:37:56,328
There is nothing.

808
01:37:58,797 --> 01:37:59,933
Beth!

809
01:38:04,670 --> 01:38:06,705
There is only me.

810
01:38:20,319 --> 01:38:22,788
Come back to me.

811
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:38,604
<i>Beth!</i>

812
01:38:48,413 --> 01:38:50,482
It doesn't matter.

813
01:38:52,718 --> 01:38:54,386
Let go.

814
01:38:58,791 --> 01:39:00,726
Come back to me.

815
01:39:35,962 --> 01:39:37,096
Beth!

816
01:39:38,664 --> 01:39:39,665
Beth!

817
01:39:41,433 --> 01:39:43,468
Oh, my God.

818
01:39:50,475 --> 01:39:51,978
I'm right here.

819
01:39:52,011 --> 01:39:54,746
Keep your head up.
This way.

820
01:40:06,259 --> 01:40:08,427
- Is she okay?
- I don't know.

821
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:09,728
What happened?

822
01:40:09,761 --> 01:40:12,631
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

823
01:40:12,664 --> 01:40:15,434
Beth? Are you here?
Are you here?

824
01:40:15,467 --> 01:40:18,804
I'm here, I'm here.

825
01:40:20,306 --> 01:40:21,740
I'm here.

826
01:40:22,541 --> 01:40:23,877
I got you.

827
01:40:23,910 --> 01:40:25,044
I'm here.

828
01:40:28,248 --> 01:40:30,149
I got you, I got you.

829
01:40:31,217 --> 01:40:33,887
I'm right here.
I'm here.

830
01:40:37,957 --> 01:40:39,158
Just breathe.

831
01:40:41,827 --> 01:40:43,528
You're safe now.

832
01:40:43,562 --> 01:40:46,065
You're okay,
you're gonna be okay.

833
01:41:07,552 --> 01:41:09,088
What is it?

834
01:41:12,125 --> 01:41:13,525
There's nothing there.

835
01:41:18,965 --> 01:41:20,033
I know.
