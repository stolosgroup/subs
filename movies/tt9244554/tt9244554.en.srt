2
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:43,859
What's missing
from this picture?

3
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:48,439
We'll start with extraction, which is
a fancy word for trashing the planet.

4
00:00:48,459 --> 00:00:51,879
What this looks like looks like is we chop
down the trees, we blow up the mountains

5
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:57,409
to get the metals inside and use up all
the water, and we wipe out the animals.

6
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:01,239
We are running out of resources.

7
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:03,679
Now, I know this can be hard
to hear, but it's the truth.

8
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:06,109
So we've got to deal with it.

9
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:07,959
In the past three decades alone,

10
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:12,109
one third of the planet's natural
resource space has been consumed.

11
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,359
Gone.

12
00:01:13,389 --> 00:01:17,319
We are cutting and lining and hauling and
trashing the place so fast that we're

13
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:21,239
undermining the planet's variability
for people to live here.

14
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:26,769
We have 5% of the world's population, but
we're using 30% of the world's resources.

15
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:32,649
If everybody consumed at U.S. rates,
we would need three to five planets.

16
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:34,879
And you know what?

17
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:38,259
We've only got one.

18
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:10,499
You live in that?

19
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:12,859
Seriously?

20
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:22,839
Does your chicken have a name?

21
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:29,579
Chicken. 
- Chicken?

22
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:31,619
Chicken.

23
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:34,419
Where's all your stuff?

24
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:37,559
I divested.
Cut myself down to 100 things.

25
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:39,899
What do you mean
100 things?

26
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:45,059
Shirt's one thing, bowls one thing
fork, sleeping bag.

27
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:49,419
Chicken.
- And you kept that hat?

28
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:55,019
Tell me you at least have a gun.

29
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,859
Jesus, Waldo.

30
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,519
When's the last time you
had anybody up here?

31
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:05,839
Three years.

32
00:04:05,869 --> 00:04:08,079
You got any friends?

33
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:10,019
Chicken.

34
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:14,327
Wow.

35
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:17,039
What the fuck is that?

36
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,599
I bought the land from a sculptor.

37
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:26,019
Sure, because this
spoke to you, right?

38
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,799
Remember that time we were
supposedly "broken up"?

39
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:33,099
I ran into you outside the art museum
on Wilshire. I was on a date.

40
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:35,259
I ditched the guy.

41
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,459
We went straight to your truck
in the parking structure.

42
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:43,819
It was right next to the
La Brea Tar Pits... by the mammoths.

43
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:45,779
Okay.

44
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,039
First of all, this
isn't a mammoth.

45
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:49,359
It's an elephant.

46
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,919
Second of all, you're
saying I bought this

47
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:56,539
property because I had a subconscious
sexual memory prompted by this sculpture.

48
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:59,085
Which you brought me straight to, the
minute I came to visit you.

49
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:00,840
Uninvited.

50
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:05,159
Look, I'm here on business.

51
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:06,979
Alastair Pinch, the actor...

52
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:10,079
- Killed his wife.
Maybe he killed her, maybe he didn't.

53
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:13,519
I don't think he even knows
the guy's a blackout drunk.

54
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:15,159
The network's got a
lot riding on him.

55
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:16,679
So they're paying
for his lawyer.

56
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:17,719
So he did kill her.

57
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:19,319
It means the money serious.

58
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:21,119
They're looking to hire a P.I.

59
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:24,599
This gig could jump
me to the majors.

60
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:29,279
If I could deliver the famous
Charlie Waldo to work it with me.

61
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:31,299
Come on.

62
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:33,199
You know those Hollywood types.

63
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:35,979
They always want to
put a big name in it.

64
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:38,019
I'm retired.

65
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:42,419
I see that... from the force.

66
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:46,139
I'd be willing to
go 80-20 yours.

67
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:48,519
What would I even
do with the money?

68
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,599
Buy a nicer 100 things.

69
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:52,199
Because then my life
would be complete?

70
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:53,859
Exactly.

71
00:05:55,383 --> 00:05:56,983
Pass.

72
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:00,039
Lydell was a long time ago.

73
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,479
- Lorena...
You don't have to keep punishing yourself.

74
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:05,439
You don't have to live like that.
- You don't have to live like that.

75
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:07,439
Fuck. You expect
me to apologize?

76
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:08,979
Hey, I grew up poor.

77
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:11,919
For real poor,
not with solar panels.

78
00:06:13,143 --> 00:06:14,543
Fine.

79
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,119
Come on, let me bring you
back into the real world.

80
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:20,359
Just for a few weeks.

81
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:22,579
We'll have some laughs.

82
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:24,659
I can't.

83
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:30,079
All right. It was worth a shot.

84
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:34,299
Can I have a hug at least?

85
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:42,859
You ghosted me, Waldo.

86
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:46,843
I ghosted everybody.

87
00:06:47,067 --> 00:06:48,579
I know.

88
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:52,339
Smell better than you look.

89
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:00,679
Can't stay up here forever.

90
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:03,599
No. Why not?

91
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:07,559
Same reason you and I
kept hooking back up.

92
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:11,419
Unfinished business is a bitch.

93
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:21,719
Things are not looking good for
celebrated actor Alastair Pinch.

94
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:23,959
He's under renewed
scrutiny by the LAPD

95
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:27,319
regarding the murder of his wife,
Monica Pinch. Two weeks ago.

96
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:29,099
Investigators say they
are focusing their

97
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:34,259
inquiries on the actor himself
as the prime suspect.

98
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:58,599
Jesus, Waldo.

99
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:04,087
You know you shouldn't do that.

100
00:08:04,111 --> 00:08:05,659
How come?

101
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:17,399
Lorena Nascimento was out
here a couple of days ago, huh?

102
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:20,499
Oh, yeah? I'd have to
check my visitors log.

103
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:24,519
Don't jerk me. She's been
scoping you for the Pinch murder.

104
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:27,939
Dumb bastard's the least
of her worries.

105
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,146
She tell you anything about Don Q?

106
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,492
Is he a game show host?

107
00:08:31,517 --> 00:08:32,839
A captain of industry.

108
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:36,239
A recreational
pharmaceutical industry.

109
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:37,439
The girls on his payroll.

110
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:38,919
That sounds like bullshit.

111
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:40,119
No, that's not bullshit.

112
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:41,799
You check out her ride.

113
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:43,599
Where do you think she
gets that kind of cheese?

114
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:47,039
Where does a cop with four kids.
get the cheese for a 'Vette?

115
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,219
Dropped this.

116
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:52,999
Anyway, she took something
belonged to Don Q.

117
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:55,919
Not exactly the healthiest
lifestyle choice.

118
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:59,879
Now, what I think is she came
up here to leave it with you.

119
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:00,799
Leave what?

120
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,859
And if you're smart,
you will give it to me.

121
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:04,679
I don't know what it is.
I haven't seen it.

122
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:06,059
Stop wasting my time, man.

123
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:09,099
The last thing she did on her
computer was Google map this ass pile.

124
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:11,319
Last call on her cell
was from Idyllwild.

125
00:09:11,349 --> 00:09:12,999
What do you mean last call?

126
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:14,559
There a Missing Persons open?

127
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:15,679
Hell, no.

128
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:18,759
That'd require
somebody gave a shit.

129
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:20,539
What?

130
00:09:20,563 --> 00:09:22,163
Oh, Jesus...

131
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:49,339
This is, Lorena.
You can leave a message but

132
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:53,739
if you want me to call you back,
you better make it interesting.

133
00:10:02,263 --> 00:10:03,963
Fucking Lorena...

134
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,519
Damn!

135
00:10:22,744 --> 00:10:24,078
Yo, hit him again.

136
00:10:24,102 --> 00:10:25,813
Come on, hit him again dog.
Hit him...

137
00:10:28,537 --> 00:10:30,457
Oh, he gonna fuck your white ass up!

138
00:10:30,561 --> 00:10:31,982
Oh, hit him again, hit him again...

139
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,235
No!
Wait! Wait!

140
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:34,940
Here we go.
Hit him again.

141
00:10:34,964 --> 00:10:39,539
Whatever the problem is here,
lets see if we can... communicate.

142
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:42,763
Is that a purse?

143
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:44,319
It's Bottega motherfucker!

144
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,243
- Shit!

145
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:48,867
- Talk his mouth...

146
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,875
- Oh shit!
- What the fuck did you hit him with?

147
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:53,201
- Oh shit.
- Hell yeah!

148
00:10:53,223 --> 00:10:54,745
Oh come on big man...
- Lou Ferrigno...

149
00:10:54,747 --> 00:10:57,168
- Come on sauce... Sex appeal...
- Damn man, that's it.

150
00:10:57,192 --> 00:10:58,325
- Sexy Warrick
- Hello.

151
00:10:58,343 --> 00:11:00,743
- Hold on, you coming? Come on big fella.
- Oh, that's it.

152
00:11:00,766 --> 00:11:02,719
What do you morons want?

153
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:05,556
Hey!
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

154
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:07,372
Relax big man!

155
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:11,130
We want you to stay your ass up
on this motherfucking mountain.

156
00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:13,799
And stay away from Alastair Pinch
- That's right.

157
00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:17,699
And if you don't, you'll get more visits
from the Palisades Posse, motherfucker.

158
00:11:19,923 --> 00:11:21,123
Fuck me.

159
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:23,194
- The fuck is wrong with him?
Help me up.

160
00:11:23,219 --> 00:11:24,759
Come on.

161
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:26,859
Yo, what do you doin?
- He said he needs to help him up...

162
00:11:26,883 --> 00:11:28,295
What the fuck are you doing?

163
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:30,279
I hate to break it to you boys.

164
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:32,855
I've got nothing to do with
Alastair Pinch.

165
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,120
Bull shit.

166
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:37,583
You work for the network. It's
in the trades. Let me see that...

167
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:39,507
Boom.

168
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:42,231
It's upside down, moron.

169
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,039
That's right.

170
00:11:46,469 --> 00:11:49,279
What the fuck?
- Knock him out dog come on...

171
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:55,279
Just stay your hill billy
ass out of L.A. bitch.

172
00:13:05,979 --> 00:13:08,419
This is Lorena.
You can leave a message but

173
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:11,579
if you want me to call you back,
you better make it interesting.

174
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:15,299
The mailbox is full and cannot accept
new messages at this time.

175
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:01,602
Mr. Waldo.

176
00:14:01,626 --> 00:14:04,479
Wilson Sigorski,
head of the network, hop In.

177
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:07,359
You know, Fontella Davis,
Alastair Pinch's attorney.

178
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,419
Never had the pleasure. Hold on.

179
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,719
Hang on, hang on.
No... No, I'm not paying him 40.

180
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:14,679
I'll pay him 25
he should be kissing my balls.

181
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:15,799
What was the last series
he had?

182
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:18,979
Two years... he'll be playing
sasquatch on the Discovery Channel.

183
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,220
Hey!

184
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:23,300
Why did you put in the trades that
I was working for your network?

185
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:26,219
Mr. Waldo, when you land a star, you
don't hide them under your ass,

186
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:29,618
you tell the whole fucking world. You were
the youngest ever Captain in the LAPD.

187
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,119
Did we get that right?
- Youngest Detective III.

188
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,159
Yeah, close enough. We want
you to start right away,

189
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:36,839
even though Lorena Nascimento
seems unavailable.

190
00:14:36,869 --> 00:14:39,479
She's missing. When's the
last time you talked to her?

191
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:41,139
No. No.

192
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:44,237
Fuck no. That I can work with.
Then you do your homework.

193
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:45,719
She's going to be
exactly like her mother.

194
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:47,479
Do you have kids, Mr. Waldo?
- No.

195
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:50,239
I'm going to give you my cell phone.
Don't call the office.

196
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:51,418
My new assistant's a fuckwit.

197
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:53,919
But call me day or night, though.
I got to get this tied up.

198
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:55,479
You may or may not
be aware I'm facing a takeover.

199
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:58,039
And I want you on NCN with
me tonight.

200
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:00,039
I assume you know how
to find a barber shop.

201
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:04,199
Hey, guys! Thing is...

202
00:15:04,229 --> 00:15:08,199
I never told Lorena I'd do this.
Sorry.

203
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:11,702
So I tell you, my nuts are in a vice,
you give them an extra turn.

204
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:14,999
If you want more money
just have your reps call me.

205
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:16,619
Shows worth twice now what
it used to be.

206
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,739
This murder thing's done
wonders for the ratings.

207
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:20,808
I could probably get 6 mil and up,

208
00:15:20,832 --> 00:15:23,859
but, you know, I got to have 100
episodes and only got 57.

209
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,079
So I need two more years of...
-Watch the cable!-

210
00:15:26,109 --> 00:15:28,999
...Alastair Pinch, healthy,
happy and off of death row.

211
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,879
I can't take this.

212
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:32,239
I only own 100 things.

213
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:34,239
If I take that, it's going
to be 101, you know?

214
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:35,359
Not really.

215
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:36,559
Well it's complicated.

216
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:38,399
Let's go with one
of the other P.I.'s.

217
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:40,919
I know we said we needed to
create distraction, but this?

218
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:43,039
Come on.
- I'm fond of your work, too.

219
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:45,079
A real P.I., one that knows
how to do the job.

220
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:46,439
Not just some has been...

221
00:15:46,469 --> 00:15:48,339
All right, look!
- Hey, hey, hey...

222
00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:51,056
I'm only here to tell you to put out a
press release

223
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,779
that says I'm not involved.
All right?

224
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:54,919
That I turned it down.
Can you do that?

225
00:15:54,939 --> 00:15:56,319
This is the hottest gig in town.

226
00:15:56,349 --> 00:15:58,578
Everybody's chasing it.
Here's what I'll do.

227
00:15:58,579 --> 00:15:59,799
I'll introduce you to Alastair.

228
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:01,999
I'll pay you for the day, whether
you take the case or not.

229
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:04,019
Excuse me.
Hey, I'm...

230
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:07,999
What was Lorena going to charge?

231
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:10,759
1000 a day plus expenses.
- 2000, and not to me.

232
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:13,459
A donation to the Sierra Club
and memory of Lydell Lipps.

233
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:15,865
Deal. It's a shame your kids
are going to miss this.

234
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:18,359
You're about to meet a
motherfucking legend.

235
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:21,079
So Stevie and I
were at my estate.

236
00:16:21,109 --> 00:16:23,979
I was drinking absinthe and
several snifters in

237
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:26,079
I decided that this
would be the perfect

238
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:29,285
night to teach Stevie Wonder...
how to drive.

239
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:32,810
and that it might be most entertaining

240
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:37,709
to let him motor about the lawn with me
outside the car trying to dodge it.

241
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:41,219
- Excuse me. Ready to shoot Mr. Pinch?
Oh, thank you, Cheryl.

242
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:44,179
Anyway, I thought I'd give
Stevie a sporting chance.

243
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:46,439
So there I was, trousers
around my ankles.

244
00:16:46,469 --> 00:16:51,599
Stevie gave it some stick and I spent the
next fortnight pissing Claret in Ward C.

245
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:55,379
Where's my mustache fluffer?
- Last Looks!

246
00:16:55,819 --> 00:16:58,299
Let me know when we're set.

247
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:00,559
Grazie babies.

248
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:06,619
Sustained. So...strained. So...stained.

249
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:09,043
Is he shit faced?
- Oh, come on!

250
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:14,269
It is such a privilege to
get to watch this man work.

251
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,839
He's got a shitload of
Shakespeare Awards under his bed.

252
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,299
Greatest fucking
actor since Brando.

253
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,859
I get him Wednesday nights
after Jessica Beal...

254
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:24,339
Background...

255
00:17:24,379 --> 00:17:27,789
and...
action!

256
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:32,839
Let me tell you a story from when
I was just a tike in Tuscaloosa.

257
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:38,839
My granddaddy, Raymond Forbushaw,
he was a jurist himself...family court.

258
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:42,519
He used to set me on
his knee and say "Johnny,"

259
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:49,619
"for 99 days the Judge's job is merely to be
that blindfold on the statue of Lady Justice."

260
00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:52,099
"For 99 days you do that."

261
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:56,269
"And justice in its natural
wisdom will find its own way."

262
00:17:56,299 --> 00:17:59,819
"But Johnny," he'd say...

263
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:09,939
"On the 100th day, a great judge
knows that he needs to be justice."

264
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:14,529
Now I wouldn't be so bold
as to call myself a great judge but...

265
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,859
I do know that as I sit here today,
I'm thinking about my granddaddy.

266
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:23,562
And that's why I'm going
to direct this verdict,

267
00:18:23,586 --> 00:18:27,579
and find this here defendent...
guilty.

268
00:18:28,703 --> 00:18:29,703
Cut!

269
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:32,611
Wow, sir.
That was terrific.

270
00:18:32,635 --> 00:18:34,719
Terrific?
It was bloody genius.

271
00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:36,679
You're not going
to top that one.

272
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,119
I'll see you all tomorrow, then.

273
00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:39,599
Did you hear what I just said?

274
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:41,599
He's supposed to say not guilty.

275
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:44,179
He said guilty.
- Fuck!

276
00:18:44,699 --> 00:18:46,269
Could of just told me
I had ass cancer.

277
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:48,029
Sorry.
- Alastair!

278
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:49,499
- Yes?
Oh god...

279
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,719
Uh, I hate to do this to you, but we're
going to have to do one more.

280
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:56,359
The last line is not guilty.
- Not guilty.

281
00:18:56,389 --> 00:18:57,719
What did I say?
- Guilty.

282
00:18:57,749 --> 00:18:59,199
The fuck I did.
- Yeah...

283
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:00,479
He didn't say that... did...
I mean...

284
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:01,749
But really, just, please...

285
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:03,229
No, I know what I said, love.

286
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:04,789
So let's just look
at the playback.

287
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:06,309
He wouldn't have said that.

288
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:08,419
Can we just see the playback, please?
- You!

289
00:19:08,469 --> 00:19:10,599
What are you smirking at?

290
00:19:10,623 --> 00:19:12,315
What? I didn't say nothing.

291
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:15,769
Do you think it's easy to carry
this piece of shit on my shoulders

292
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:16,959
week after week?

293
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,959
You think I need a twat like you
standing there looking like a crocodile?

294
00:19:19,989 --> 00:19:22,500
How long have you worked on this show?

295
00:19:22,824 --> 00:19:23,989
It's my first week.

296
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:26,509
Your first week?
It's his first week, everyone.

297
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:28,139
A bloody week!

298
00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:35,269
God!

299
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,879
That's why I'm going to
direct this verdict.

300
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:39,426
Let that be a lesson to you.

301
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,515
You good?

302
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:43,426
I'm fine. Let's do this.
Come on.

303
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,189
Let's do it.
Let's roll!

304
00:19:46,013 --> 00:19:47,213
Rolling!

305
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:48,995
Does that happen often?

306
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:50,313
Sometimes after lunch.

307
00:19:50,637 --> 00:19:53,449
We always put a stunt guy
right there. Pay him extra.

308
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:55,839
Don't tell Alastair.

309
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,339
Ready. Action!

310
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:04,069
...and find this here
Defendant, not guilty.

311
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:05,279
Cut!

312
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:06,803
Cheers.

313
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:10,159
Wouldn't be the first
time I've had the clap.

314
00:20:22,794 --> 00:20:23,994
Entre.

315
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:28,029
Not guilty.

316
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:30,879
The Lord is the manner down to
slum a bit with the vassals.

317
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:32,069
To what do we owe the honor?

318
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:34,879
I wanted to introduce
you to Charlie Waldo.

319
00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:37,969
The Detective we told you about.
Used to be King Shit at the LAPD.

320
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:40,069
Ah...the fallen angel.
You've landed him.

321
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:41,199
Did I promise you I would.

322
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:43,122
I'd give you the shirt off
my back, you know that?

323
00:20:43,146 --> 00:20:45,959
I'd prefer the watch off your wrist.
Have you seen what this man wears?

324
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:48,399
Costs more than the
house I grew up in.

325
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:51,359
Kudoke Skeleton. They
only make 35 a year.

326
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:53,298
Maybe I'll make you a wrap gift of one,
how's that?

327
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:56,439
Well, can we have that signed in blood?
- Signed in blood he says!

328
00:20:56,569 --> 00:21:00,269
I'm done for the day. Detective,
do you have plans? Where do you live?

329
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,639
Idyllwild. I'm only
here for today.

330
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:05,789
The details we're still working out.
- I haven't agreed to take this case.

331
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:07,919
I'll find a hotel for tonight.
- Nonsense.

332
00:21:07,939 --> 00:21:09,719
- You'll stay at my house.
Great idea.

333
00:21:09,749 --> 00:21:11,359
Right to the scene of the crime.

334
00:21:11,389 --> 00:21:15,229
You don't mind sleeping surrounded
by yellow tape, do you?

335
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:18,159
This fucking guy.
Come on, Waldo.

336
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:19,599
What do you say? What's the
worst that can happen?

337
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:21,029
Lorena turns up in a day or two.

338
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:24,069
You can go back to
wherever you came from.

339
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:26,639
Hell, maybe you can get
your reputation back.

340
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:28,899
Just kidding.

341
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:39,459
Interest you in a wee
snifter Detective?

342
00:21:40,139 --> 00:21:41,639
No, thank you.

343
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:42,879
I deplore drinking alone.

344
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:45,139
So I'll have a double.

345
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:50,549
She was so proud of this room.

346
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:55,579
Chinchin. This was in Townen Wanker
magazine, you know.

347
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:59,179
Why don't you walk me
through that morning?

348
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:04,019
All right.

349
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:06,619
One more time.

350
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:10,199
It was a Saturday.

351
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:16,725
I woke up, or came to, in my study
about a half a mile down that way.

352
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:19,999
I realized I had no
recollection of the previous night.

353
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:24,599
I came in here, found
my sweet Monica.

354
00:22:25,939 --> 00:22:30,019
I ran back to the kitchen,
dialed 911.

355
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,820
There was a shattered vase.

356
00:22:32,844 --> 00:22:35,580
Uh... Anyhow,
when the ambulance arrived,

357
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:40,659
they told me she was already gone
and had been for quite some time.

358
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:45,359
Does anyone else have keys?

359
00:22:45,389 --> 00:22:46,599
Only Rosario.

360
00:22:46,629 --> 00:22:47,959
That's our nanny.

361
00:22:47,989 --> 00:22:50,599
And she was in Venezuela
visiting her family.

362
00:22:50,629 --> 00:22:52,119
Nanny.

363
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:53,519
Little kids in the house?

364
00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:56,639
Yes, we have one child, Gaby.

365
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:58,399
She likely wasn't
the killer either.

366
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,519
But she'll be home from
kindergarten soon enough.

367
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:03,119
If you think it's worth
trying to wrest a confession.

368
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:05,309
Pretty glib, considering.

369
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:10,099
Forgive me. Dear, Gaby
doesn't even know, of course.

370
00:23:11,699 --> 00:23:14,029
The world is certain
I murdered my wife, Mr. Waldo

371
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,859
and I can't even tell
you the world is wrong.

372
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,569
If you know a man who's
handled a similar predicament

373
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:25,399
with more élan, point me
to him and I shall gladly emulate.

374
00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:29,179
You ever thought about
trying to stop drinking?

375
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:33,003
All the time.

376
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:37,539
But this doesn't seem the
week for that, now does it?

377
00:23:37,963 --> 00:23:39,963
- Daddy!
- Princess!

378
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:43,059
Where did you come from?

379
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:46,512
Want to hear the song little
dog taught us at school today?

380
00:23:46,536 --> 00:23:48,839
A little dog?
Why, yes, of course.

381
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:50,679
Brush every morning.

382
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:56,209
Brush every night. I brush and I
brush so my teeth will be white.

383
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:58,069
Teeth can be shiny.

384
00:23:58,099 --> 00:23:59,789
Teeth can be gold.

385
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:04,659
I hope I still have
some when I'm very old.

386
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,939
- You know it!
I do know it. Gaby,

387
00:24:06,969 --> 00:24:10,919
I'd like to meet my new friend,
Mr. Waldo.

388
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:15,179
He looks scary like a lion.
- Yeah, but he's a friendly lion.

389
00:24:15,503 --> 00:24:18,841
Gaby and I are going to spend some daddy
time with each other.

390
00:24:18,865 --> 00:24:21,403
Are you smuggling baby fat,
are you? Oh...

391
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:25,879
Oh, uh, you haven't decided to
take the case yet, have you?

392
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:27,269
What say you, Detective?

393
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,959
Will you return to your mountain
and leave me to the fates?

394
00:24:30,979 --> 00:24:34,549
Or will you stick around the shitty of the
Angels long enough to see the police,

395
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:38,139
maybe get it right this time.
Whatever right may look like.

396
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:41,879
Daddy, can Mr. Lion drive
to school with us tomorrow?

397
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:44,299
Can he please?
Please?

398
00:24:55,754 --> 00:24:57,454
Will this be alright?

399
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:01,579
It's perfect.

400
00:25:07,703 --> 00:25:09,403
Fucking Lorena.

401
00:25:32,327 --> 00:25:33,527
Guilty.

402
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,519
And turn down the volume
on the Media Circus.

403
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:38,879
Oh, come on, Fontella.

404
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:40,439
You live for the Media Circus.

405
00:25:40,459 --> 00:25:43,259
Now I'm hearing there could be an
indictment as early as tomorrow.

406
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,539
We've not been told that.

407
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:48,159
And now L.A. Times is reporting that
sources on the LAPD state there are no

408
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:52,069
unidentified fingerprints anywhere in
that room. What does that suggest to you?

409
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:54,399
It suggests that the real
killer knew what he was doing.

410
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,759
You promised us Charlie Waldo

411
00:25:55,779 --> 00:25:58,999
from the Lydell Lipps case. What does it say
that he's not here with you?

412
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:02,659
Charlie Waldo is
busy uncovering...

413
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:12,216
Welcome to kindergartens of
the rich and famous.

414
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,099
Gaby, Mr. Lion needs
to talk to your teacher.

415
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:17,599
But first, he's going to park this beast.

416
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:20,239
Now get out, little blighter

417
00:26:22,763 --> 00:26:24,463
Baby back ribs in there!

418
00:26:25,087 --> 00:26:26,687
Come here you speedy little runt!

419
00:26:27,511 --> 00:26:29,311
Alas, poor Yorick.

420
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:31,499
I knew him, my sweet Gaby.

421
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,927
A fellow of infinite jest
and most excellent fancy.

422
00:26:34,951 --> 00:26:37,789
He hath borne me
on his back a thousand times.

423
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:42,549
And now how abhorred in my imagination
it is! My gorge rises at it.

424
00:26:42,579 --> 00:26:44,679
You're a shadow of
your former self.

425
00:26:44,709 --> 00:26:48,909
It's that keto diet I'm on. I'm starving
I think may have taken too far.

426
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:52,633
You got anything in your lunch?
Like a porkchop? Ham Sandwich? No?

427
00:26:52,699 --> 00:26:55,639
I'm afraid it wouldn't do you any good.
Dear boy, I think you're dead.

428
00:26:55,669 --> 00:27:00,499
Dead! That's tragic.
Yes, indeed. It's tragic.

429
00:27:00,629 --> 00:27:03,399
Wherever your jibes
now your gambles,

430
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:09,129
your songs, your flashes of merriment that
were want to set the table on a roar.

431
00:27:10,453 --> 00:27:12,453
I got soil in my britches!

432
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:15,559
So they changed my nappy.
Now it's all squishy.

433
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:20,483
- Bravo! That was funny daddy!
Uh, yes, thank you, thank you.

434
00:27:20,499 --> 00:27:23,479
Yes, that speech
always slays them.

435
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:28,119
Come, uh, let's play on the swings. I believe
Mr. Lion wants to ask Miss White whether

436
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:31,899
Daddy plays nicely
with the other children.

437
00:27:34,979 --> 00:27:37,199
My name is Waldo.

438
00:27:37,229 --> 00:27:40,479
I'm a Detective working for Alastair.
- Jayne.

439
00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:42,819
My heart breaks for Gaby.

440
00:27:42,849 --> 00:27:45,999
Mr. Pinch is doing a lot to
keep her spirits up.

441
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:50,059
And Mrs. Pinch, what was
she like as a parent?

442
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:54,379
Mrs. Pinch?

443
00:27:56,739 --> 00:27:59,399
We have the children
memorize these poems.

444
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:03,059
I like to ask the kids whose mom and
dad can recite them to them.

445
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:05,229
Half the time these parents can't but

446
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:08,579
the nanny can
in two languages.

447
00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:10,719
What about the Pinches?

448
00:28:10,749 --> 00:28:12,719
Mrs. Pinch never knew them.

449
00:28:12,749 --> 00:28:14,359
Mr. Pinch?

450
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:16,029
Always.

451
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:17,979
That's unusual.

452
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:21,659
Her death must have shock the
hell out of this place, huh?

453
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:24,339
Not me.

454
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,639
Good morning, kids.

455
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:31,419
Okay, everyone find their place.
Get your bunnies. We're going to

456
00:28:31,449 --> 00:28:34,459
start by writing our names on the back of
them. So everyone have a marker.

457
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:38,879
Miss White, I'm going to need
to talk to you again.

458
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:40,659
Sure.

459
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:45,419
Does everyone have their Bunny from yesterday?
- Yes, Miss White.

460
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,759
Come meet me tonight.

461
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:52,339
We can talk then.

462
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:56,799
All right. Have you got your name set?
- Yes, Miss White.

463
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:56,029
Do you put your boots
on your chairs at home?

464
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:59,779
I live in a trailer
with a chicken.

465
00:29:59,939 --> 00:30:02,459
What happened to this vase?

466
00:30:02,783 --> 00:30:04,183
"Vahz".

467
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:07,879
Ah, yes. Well...

468
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:12,259
That's the one she
was killed with.

469
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:15,439
What was that... ceramic?
- Ovenware.

470
00:30:15,469 --> 00:30:17,439
Nice vase, I rather miss it.

471
00:30:17,469 --> 00:30:20,019
What about that table?

472
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,519
It's different.

473
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:24,199
Monica was a tinkerer.

474
00:30:24,229 --> 00:30:28,339
No room was ever finished
to her satisfaction.

475
00:30:28,663 --> 00:30:30,663
And that sculpture?

476
00:30:31,387 --> 00:30:33,087
The blood?

477
00:30:33,411 --> 00:30:36,211
The sculpture. This.
- Right.

478
00:30:38,459 --> 00:30:43,959
Ah, dear boy, that's a Regis
Award for my Richard III.

479
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:45,549
Did you move it.

480
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:48,999
I've never been much
for acting trophies.

481
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:52,029
Monica had that one on display
for sentimental reasons.

482
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:54,719
That was the production
on which we met. Really?

483
00:30:54,749 --> 00:30:59,549
Perhaps it's wherever Monica put
my other Regis's or my...

484
00:30:59,573 --> 00:31:01,873
People's Choice Award.

485
00:31:02,939 --> 00:31:05,759
Oh, good night, sweet Prince.

486
00:31:05,789 --> 00:31:09,459
Flights of Angels
sing me to thy bless.

487
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:46,099
There goes the good girl
kindergarten teacher.

488
00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:49,969
Just wait until I have a
few Makers in me.

489
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:54,639
So why weren't you shocked when
Monica Pinch was killed?

490
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:05,639
Okay.
Mr. Waldo, I have a confession.

491
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:08,539
Okay.

492
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:13,259
I've been watching all this
TV coverage since the murder.

493
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:19,449
I know exactly who you were the
minute you walked into my classroom.

494
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,479
I figured.

495
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:29,159
Who was Lydell Lipps?

496
00:32:29,189 --> 00:32:33,019
Everyone keeps talking
about Lydell Lipps.

497
00:32:38,379 --> 00:32:40,419
I can usually tell when
someone's messing with me.

498
00:32:40,449 --> 00:32:43,239
You're jamming up my radar.

499
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:47,139
Maybe your radar is just rusty.

500
00:32:48,063 --> 00:32:49,774
Yeah, maybe.

501
00:32:50,087 --> 00:32:51,810
Here you go.

502
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:00,799
To whiskey and good hair.

503
00:33:13,219 --> 00:33:15,699
It's been a while.

504
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:27,899
Okay, if you want to
know, I'll tell you.

505
00:33:32,499 --> 00:33:36,419
Eleven years ago,
there was a robbery, 711.

506
00:33:36,449 --> 00:33:41,239
The girl behind the counter
and two customers got shot dead.

507
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,990
I turned up,
a kid named Donny Lipps,

508
00:33:45,014 --> 00:33:46,919
leaned on him pretty hard.

509
00:33:46,949 --> 00:33:50,119
It paid off. He said he was
waiting in the car outside.

510
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:54,479
And in return for a deal he
would give me the shooter.

511
00:33:54,509 --> 00:33:58,253
Turns out that was like, uh, his brother.

512
00:33:58,277 --> 00:33:59,822
Signed, sealed...

513
00:34:00,446 --> 00:34:02,709
My career was off to the races,
right,

514
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,439
and I am on
fire with ambition.

515
00:34:05,469 --> 00:34:07,779
Everything's going great.

516
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:11,619
Cut to years later, Lydell
comes up for parole,

517
00:34:11,939 --> 00:34:14,799
and the prosecutors asked me to
help them prep for the hearing.

518
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,239
So I go see the brother again.

519
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:20,819
Who's in prison himself at
this point, 3 strikes unrelated.

520
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:27,159
Only now he tells me that the
original story was bullshit.

521
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:32,459
He made it up. To get
me off his back.

522
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:38,419
So, what, at that point Lydell had
been in jail for...

523
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:42,999
Seven years, three months
and sixteen days.

524
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:46,759
Next thing I learned,

525
00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:52,289
it is a lot harder to get an innocent man
out of jail than to put a guilty man in.

526
00:34:52,589 --> 00:34:55,079
The system isn't designed
to deal with mistakes.

527
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:59,379
And some individuals aren't either.

528
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:04,439
I keep pushing and I keep
pushing and I keep pushing.

529
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:07,999
And I'm doing everything I can.

530
00:35:08,029 --> 00:35:11,539
And this goes on for a year.

531
00:35:13,499 --> 00:35:17,109
And then Lydell got stabbed.

532
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:22,639
In a yard fight, and he bled to death after
spending every day of his adult life

533
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:26,079
locked up for something
that he didn't fucking do.

534
00:35:26,103 --> 00:35:27,975
And that I...

535
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:30,603
built a career on.

536
00:35:37,899 --> 00:35:40,599
And when I ran out of
people who would listen,

537
00:35:40,629 --> 00:35:43,739
which took about six months...

538
00:35:44,963 --> 00:35:46,363
Um...

539
00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:53,319
I quit and I started talking
to anyone with a microphone.

540
00:35:54,179 --> 00:35:56,879
I guess that would have
burned a lot of bridges.

541
00:35:56,909 --> 00:36:00,539
Oh, I burned the fucking river.

542
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:08,047
You still haven't told me.

543
00:36:08,071 --> 00:36:09,159
What?

544
00:36:10,659 --> 00:36:14,109
Why weren't you shocked
about Monica Pinch?

545
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:16,109
Well, of course I was shocked.

546
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:19,059
And how could I not be shocked?

547
00:36:19,283 --> 00:36:21,083
I don't follow.

548
00:36:22,207 --> 00:36:23,607
Waldo...

549
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:29,939
Can't you tell when a girl just wants
to have a drink with you?

550
00:36:49,163 --> 00:36:51,163
I said a drink.

551
00:36:56,819 --> 00:36:58,479
Three years in the woods.

552
00:36:58,509 --> 00:37:02,139
You haven't been with
anybody all that time?

553
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:05,339
No.

554
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:11,859
That's kind of hot, Waldo.

555
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:31,551
Alastair! They're going to arrest you.

556
00:37:31,575 --> 00:37:34,759
Those are news helicopters.
LAPD is putting on a show.

557
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:36,839
Go put some clothes on.
- Don't be silly, Love.

558
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:40,285
The network will adore me
in this wardrobe.

559
00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:41,439
Anyway...

560
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:44,819
if it's good enough for Wacko
Jacko, it's good enough for me.

561
00:37:44,849 --> 00:37:47,449
- Beautiful.
Tits and teeth.

562
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:48,673
Fuck.

563
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:50,584
Morning.

564
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:53,219
Alastair Pinch, you're under arrest for the
murder of Monica Pinch.

565
00:37:53,243 --> 00:37:54,954
Hey, come on.
Do we have to do it like this?

566
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:56,814
Let him go in and surrender himself.

567
00:37:56,991 --> 00:37:58,935
- Hands behind your back.
Really? You going to cuff him?

568
00:37:59,059 --> 00:38:01,799
You can't do me a solid for old times?
- Fuck you, old times...

569
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:04,479
You made 10,000 good cops
look like the fucking Klan.

570
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:06,669
Say goodbye to your pretty
house, huh, Olivier?

571
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:09,479
Last time you're going to see it.
- Daddy!

572
00:38:09,509 --> 00:38:11,799
Daddy's just going
for a sleep of it.

573
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:13,779
Be a good girl, see you tomorrow.
- Let's go.

574
00:38:33,203 --> 00:38:34,403
Hey!

575
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:37,627
Excuse me. Excuse me!

576
00:38:48,814 --> 00:38:51,626
Did he get bail?
- 20 million.

577
00:38:52,939 --> 00:38:54,839
Don't be silly. We're
paying the bail.

578
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:57,399
It's only 20 million. We're
insured for it. Hold on.

579
00:38:57,429 --> 00:38:59,109
- I've got to talk to you
That's the end of it.

580
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:01,189
I spoke to my guy at LAPD.

581
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:03,319
He's why they turned
it into a festival.

582
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:05,279
You have to get rid of him.

583
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:08,812
Look, I'm happy to quit. I don't
want to make this worse for anybody.

584
00:39:08,836 --> 00:39:12,239
Worse? You're making it better. Listen,
does one of you guys have the time?

585
00:39:12,259 --> 00:39:14,079
Apparently, I have Charlie
Sheen in my office.

586
00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:15,839
How is he making it better?

587
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:19,479
The bigger assholes the cops are
the more sympathy for our protagonist.

588
00:39:19,509 --> 00:39:21,719
Cheer up, Waldo. You
can't win them all.

589
00:39:21,749 --> 00:39:23,899
Yeah, yeah. Be right there.

590
00:39:24,123 --> 00:39:25,523
Asshole.

591
00:39:48,154 --> 00:39:49,954
Jesus! Waldo!

592
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:54,044
Oh, boy. You don't know me anymore,
you understand? You're poison!

593
00:39:54,068 --> 00:39:56,189
It's good to see you too, Freddy.

594
00:39:56,219 --> 00:39:57,699
You been in division yet?

595
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:01,109
Uh, uh. Probably twenty guys in that
building like to knock my teeth out.

596
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:06,639
Twenty? A hundred. Twenty would like
to shoot them out with a bullet.

597
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,669
I want the autopsy
protocol on Monica Pinch.

598
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,799
All the slides, all the photos.

599
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:14,239
Yeah, good luck with that.

600
00:40:14,259 --> 00:40:16,319
They indict defense has
the right to everything.

601
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:18,629
So you can deal with me.

602
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:20,359
Or you can deal with
Fontella Davis.

603
00:40:20,389 --> 00:40:23,859
Who's every bit the delight she
seems on TV. And who, by the way,

604
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:29,019
never got you Laker tickets or lied
to your wife to cover for you.

605
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:33,619
Charlie fucking Waldo.
Jesus.

606
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:41,522
Straight up, Freddie.
How'd you make this?

607
00:40:41,546 --> 00:40:42,599
Cerebral hemorrhage.

608
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:45,131
Severe blow to the right temple.
Second contusion back of the head.

609
00:40:45,155 --> 00:40:47,629
Probably from where she fell.
Victim was found locked in her house

610
00:40:47,659 --> 00:40:49,629
with a drunk with two assault
convictions in England.

611
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:54,109
So I'm guessing suicide. And the alarm...
You know about that, right?

612
00:40:54,139 --> 00:40:57,559
Turns out the alarm company has it
being on since the previous night.

613
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:58,959
Before or after time of death?

614
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,479
Too close to call.

615
00:41:00,509 --> 00:41:03,839
Guy clobbered his wife
to death with a vase.

616
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:05,859
That simple.

617
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:20,579
Hello?
- I know who killed Monica Pinch.

618
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:25,559
Who is this?
- Meet me at that rock pile you live at Waldo.

619
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:28,599
I'm not there. I'm in LA.
-That piece of shit trailer. Now.

620
00:41:28,623 --> 00:41:30,823
- Nini, is that a croissant?
- Give me one of those.

621
00:42:03,347 --> 00:42:05,233
Nini, check underneath there.

622
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:10,699
Nothing? Anything?
Huh. Open this shit up.

623
00:42:12,899 --> 00:42:15,299
This a Kindle?

624
00:42:15,311 --> 00:42:17,399
How do you like it so far?

625
00:42:17,429 --> 00:42:20,579
I'm trying to decide
between this and the Nook.

626
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:23,559
Looks a little cheaper.

627
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:25,079
I like the Kindle for content.

628
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:28,859
Content, right. How's that
tech support? Keep looking.

629
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:29,977
Pretty good.

630
00:42:30,001 --> 00:42:32,239
Out of ten,
what would you give it?

631
00:42:32,269 --> 00:42:33,619
Eight.
- Eight.

632
00:42:33,643 --> 00:42:34,643
Fucking bitch...

633
00:42:46,659 --> 00:42:48,149
I'm Don Q.

634
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:50,499
You heard of me?

635
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:53,519
This man is Nini.

636
00:42:53,549 --> 00:42:55,879
Do not fuck with this man.

637
00:42:55,899 --> 00:42:58,319
He was number one ranked
Inuit light heavyweight.

638
00:42:58,349 --> 00:43:00,294
Nini, squeeze me.

639
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:01,979
Inuit?
- Yeah.

640
00:43:02,109 --> 00:43:04,439
Is that like Eskimo?

641
00:43:04,469 --> 00:43:07,219
No, no.
See...

642
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,239
Nini here,
he's from Canada.

643
00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:16,427
You can say Eskimo in Alaska, but in Canada,
they prefer to be called Inuit.

644
00:43:16,451 --> 00:43:19,139
To them Eskimo is
considered pejorative.

645
00:43:19,169 --> 00:43:22,119
Can we...
Can we be careful with the chicken?

646
00:43:22,143 --> 00:43:23,243
Yeah...

647
00:43:27,419 --> 00:43:28,439
There he goes.

648
00:43:28,469 --> 00:43:30,099
Wow.

649
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:32,879
That was fucking good.

650
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:34,039
Yeah, of course.

651
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:36,599
That ain't the reason
for our visit.

652
00:43:36,629 --> 00:43:37,719
Where is it?

653
00:43:37,749 --> 00:43:39,819
Where is what?

654
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:43,659
The Mem that Lorena
left with you.

655
00:43:45,383 --> 00:43:47,383
Where is it, Waldo?
- Huh?

656
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:52,307
I'm starting to think you're not here
to tell me you killed Monica Pinch.

657
00:43:52,331 --> 00:43:54,331
So you are a Detective.

658
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:58,499
Where are all your possessions?

659
00:43:58,523 --> 00:44:00,395
I'm a minimalist.

660
00:44:00,419 --> 00:44:05,419
What's that like the, uh, artist with
the white on white and shit?

661
00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:10,319
Sort of like a lifestyle?
I only have 100 things.

662
00:44:13,979 --> 00:44:15,539
100 things?

663
00:44:15,563 --> 00:44:17,563
Well, ninety-nine now.

664
00:44:19,787 --> 00:44:21,385
That's a fun fact, Waldo.

665
00:44:22,909 --> 00:44:25,087
Especially if one of them is mine.

666
00:44:25,779 --> 00:44:29,499
You got 24 hours and
then I want my Mem.

667
00:44:30,323 --> 00:44:31,623
What's a Mem?

668
00:44:31,647 --> 00:44:34,147
You call my boy here when you
got it in hand.

669
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,171
818 ME-NANOOK.

670
00:44:38,395 --> 00:44:39,649
The alternative...

671
00:44:41,673 --> 00:44:43,895
maybe you end up like Lorena.

672
00:44:47,179 --> 00:44:48,759
Where is she?
- Nini,

673
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:51,099
Let's go.
- Hey, fuck face!

674
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:54,135
Nice. I don't think I look like a
fuck face.

675
00:44:54,147 --> 00:44:56,170
If anything I think he looks
like a fuck face.

676
00:44:56,271 --> 00:44:58,383
I mean, what does a fuck face
look like?

677
00:45:38,895 --> 00:45:40,585
This doesn't make sense.

678
00:45:46,609 --> 00:45:48,462
Back to 100.

679
00:46:02,686 --> 00:46:04,505
That's right.

680
00:46:13,059 --> 00:46:14,089
Charlie Waldo.

681
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:17,999
This is what I want. One: Everyone
who is on crime scene security.

682
00:46:18,629 --> 00:46:20,479
Two: All transport medical
and emergency

683
00:46:20,499 --> 00:46:22,959
personnel out contact with
victims and the suspect.

684
00:46:22,979 --> 00:46:25,499
Don't talk to him. Nobody gives him anything.
He's a rat.

685
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:27,239
Nothing to see here. Shows over.

686
00:46:27,259 --> 00:46:28,219
Let's go back to work.

687
00:46:28,249 --> 00:46:29,639
How about first to respond?

688
00:46:29,642 --> 00:46:32,699
I'll start there. Huh?

689
00:46:32,699 --> 00:46:34,479
Don't talk to him.
Nobody talks to him.

690
00:46:34,499 --> 00:46:37,679
He's not here, right? You ignore
him. Understand? Understood?

691
00:46:37,709 --> 00:46:41,259
You do what I say. Not a deadbeat.
- You.

692
00:46:41,379 --> 00:46:45,459
Officer...
Anus?

693
00:46:45,489 --> 00:46:46,639
Annis.

694
00:46:46,659 --> 00:46:47,879
High school must have sucked.

695
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:50,559
Do not speak to him, Annis
- You were at the Pinch house?

696
00:46:50,589 --> 00:46:52,799
You're the first ones you and your partner?
- Annis...

697
00:46:52,829 --> 00:46:56,189
Do you know who Fontella Davis is?
- Ignore him.

698
00:46:56,219 --> 00:46:58,399
Do you want her on TV every night
making this case about you?

699
00:46:58,429 --> 00:46:59,189
Shows over.

700
00:46:59,219 --> 00:47:02,479
When you arrived at the house
was the door deadbolted?

701
00:47:02,509 --> 00:47:04,218
You sure? It's frosted glass.

702
00:47:04,219 --> 00:47:06,247
You couldn't see him unlock it,
you heard him that clearly?

703
00:47:06,271 --> 00:47:07,819
The alarm was on, we saw him disarm it.

704
00:47:07,849 --> 00:47:09,298
- What did I say?
Yes, Anus.

705
00:47:09,299 --> 00:47:10,699
But the real killer
could have set

706
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:13,319
the alarm on the way out if
the door wasn't deadbolted.

707
00:47:13,339 --> 00:47:14,785
See he's just talking circles...
- What about the murd weapon?

708
00:47:14,809 --> 00:47:16,119
It's all bullshit.

709
00:47:16,149 --> 00:47:19,294
The Earthenware Vase. It wasn't you that
gathered up all the pieces was it?

710
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:21,839
Do not fucking answer him.
All right?

711
00:47:22,059 --> 00:47:23,978
Yes, Waldo.
He got all the pieces of the murder weapon.

712
00:47:23,979 --> 00:47:25,039
I supervised it myself.

713
00:47:25,069 --> 00:47:26,959
The Earthenware vase?
- Earthenware vase.

714
00:47:26,979 --> 00:47:29,679
Only the Earthenware vase
isn't the murder weapon.

715
00:47:29,709 --> 00:47:32,359
Not if Alastair Pinch killed her.
That thing's got to weight

716
00:47:32,589 --> 00:47:35,719
28 lbs. It came down over
the victim's right eye.

717
00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:38,079
You'd have to be a pretty strong
lefty to make a shot like that.

718
00:47:38,109 --> 00:47:39,239
Not a drunken righty.

719
00:47:39,269 --> 00:47:40,620
Almost convincing.

720
00:47:40,644 --> 00:47:45,219
Pinch is a righty. I've watched him
pour. Officer Annis. Can I have a moment?

721
00:47:46,179 --> 00:47:48,119
You see that statue?

722
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:50,099
That's a Regis award
for acting in England.

723
00:47:50,129 --> 00:47:52,259
You ever seen it before?

724
00:47:52,299 --> 00:47:53,359
Because it's missing.

725
00:47:53,389 --> 00:47:55,479
That's the murder weapon.
- Oh, please, time to go home.

726
00:47:55,499 --> 00:47:56,305
Three and a half pounds.

727
00:47:56,329 --> 00:47:59,359
The earthenware vase, the
victim hit that on the way down.

728
00:47:59,389 --> 00:48:00,639
Hey, don't look at him.

729
00:48:00,659 --> 00:48:02,925
The Department is going to let you
get fucked on this. Believe me, I know.

730
00:48:02,949 --> 00:48:04,818
That's it, Waldo. I'm going
to give you 10 seconds.

731
00:48:04,819 --> 00:48:05,879
How about that?
- 10 seconds?

732
00:48:05,899 --> 00:48:07,079
Yeah, perfect.
That's all I need.

733
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:07,679
Nine
Annis.

734
00:48:07,709 --> 00:48:10,479
You don't want to be the guy who puts
away innocent man, believe me.

735
00:48:10,709 --> 00:48:13,339
Might as well pull down your pants.
Cause you gonna get fucked!

736
00:48:13,363 --> 00:48:14,395
Come on.
4, 3, 2, 1.

737
00:48:14,419 --> 00:48:17,235
It sounded like he fumbled with the deadbolt.
- What did I tell you?

738
00:48:17,259 --> 00:48:18,239
He was still drunk.

739
00:48:18,259 --> 00:48:19,519
We couldn't tell for sure.

740
00:48:19,549 --> 00:48:20,719
Shut the fuck up.

741
00:48:20,749 --> 00:48:21,759
Anus.

742
00:48:21,789 --> 00:48:23,719
Nobody talks to this scumsack.

743
00:48:23,749 --> 00:48:25,999
This man is not a cop.
He is not one of us.

744
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:27,319
He's a fucking rat.

745
00:48:27,349 --> 00:48:31,079
He's a person of interest in
a homicide investigation.

746
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:36,179
For those of you that
don't know body of one

747
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:41,759
adult female ID'd as
Lorena Nasimento.

748
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:44,279
She borrowed her
husband's Porsche.

749
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:46,159
Ah, she didn't tell you
about him, did she?

750
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:49,679
We found it on fire off the
freeway up by Magic Mountain.

751
00:48:49,709 --> 00:48:53,559
Fully engulfed body inside.

752
00:48:53,589 --> 00:48:55,279
That item she gave you.

753
00:48:55,299 --> 00:49:00,059
That could put Don Q away for so
long you'd both die of natural causes.

754
00:49:00,899 --> 00:49:03,079
Why don't you just give it to me.

755
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:06,559
I tried to warn you.

756
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:25,579
What the fuck?

757
00:49:35,003 --> 00:49:38,203
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you!

758
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:51,027
Killed her!

759
00:49:52,551 --> 00:49:54,951
They fucking killed her!

760
00:50:17,475 --> 00:50:18,475
I, uh...

761
00:50:18,939 --> 00:50:21,159
I had my bike on this rack.

762
00:50:21,189 --> 00:50:23,339
I think I left my lock.

763
00:50:23,363 --> 00:50:25,363
Following me all day, you...

764
00:50:25,687 --> 00:50:27,687
Who the fuck are you?

765
00:50:27,739 --> 00:50:31,559
I'm an attorney. I'm a attorney, specializing
in personal injury.

766
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:36,789
If you do not unhand me, then
I'll seek damages, please.

767
00:50:37,113 --> 00:50:38,613
That's fine.

768
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:41,837
That's fine.

769
00:50:44,139 --> 00:50:47,819
You a Private I?
- Yeah. I'm a Private I.

770
00:50:48,299 --> 00:50:49,839
Who the fuck are you?

771
00:50:49,869 --> 00:50:52,159
You, sir, just
committed a felony.

772
00:50:52,179 --> 00:50:53,679
Presenting yourself
as a PI in the state

773
00:50:53,709 --> 00:50:56,679
of California when you
are in fact unlicensed.

774
00:50:56,709 --> 00:50:58,479
Now, I will level with you.

775
00:50:58,509 --> 00:51:01,999
I have a client who
cannot understand why

776
00:51:02,029 --> 00:51:07,529
you would associate yourself with
a murderer like Alastair Pinch.

777
00:51:15,299 --> 00:51:17,939
Beautiful watch.

778
00:51:24,663 --> 00:51:28,963
What is the time?
Listen, asshole.

779
00:51:28,979 --> 00:51:32,619
I'm not going to let you
muscle me off this case.

780
00:51:32,643 --> 00:51:34,799
Alright? Let's just communicate. 
- No, Mr. Waldo.

781
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:37,719
There's been no threat
from me, nor do I intend one.

782
00:51:37,749 --> 00:51:40,139
Or I'm going to fucking kill you.
- I apologize

783
00:51:40,749 --> 00:51:43,639
Sir, listen. It is my hope and
my client's that this

784
00:51:43,669 --> 00:51:47,559
pleasant, okay, happenstantial
meeting between the two of us

785
00:51:47,589 --> 00:51:51,839
is the last time you and I see each
other. So with that in mind...

786
00:51:51,979 --> 00:51:54,779
- So speak.
Sir, please.

787
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:59,579
Take my things.

788
00:52:01,979 --> 00:52:04,759
You know, actually, on second thought.

789
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:08,399
Neither one of these are my bike.

790
00:52:09,423 --> 00:52:10,923
Good day.

791
00:52:22,147 --> 00:52:25,391
Yeah, thanks for the phone,
you fucking ambulance chaser.

792
00:52:30,015 --> 00:52:33,615
Warren Gomes, Esquire.

793
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:38,160
Warren Gomes.
The last call was to...

794
00:52:38,863 --> 00:52:40,841
Darius Jamshidi.

795
00:52:40,919 --> 00:52:45,799
Darius Jamshidi...
Darius Jamshidi...

796
00:52:51,823 --> 00:52:55,912
Where do we live,
Darius Jamshidi?

797
00:53:05,436 --> 00:53:06,536
Jamshidi.

798
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,303
Not going to wrestle me off this case,
asshole.

799
00:53:10,384 --> 00:53:12,160
Fuckers.

800
00:54:19,984 --> 00:54:21,984
You ghosted me, Waldo.

801
00:54:35,008 --> 00:54:37,008
Motherfuckers.

802
00:54:49,032 --> 00:54:52,398
I'm looking for Darius Jamshidi.

803
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:03,759
Come on, who's going to help me?

804
00:55:04,189 --> 00:55:06,239
Are you going to help me?

805
00:55:06,763 --> 00:55:08,651
I spy...

806
00:55:09,475 --> 00:55:11,608
with my little eye...

807
00:55:12,032 --> 00:55:14,963
Darius Jamshidi.

808
00:55:16,487 --> 00:55:19,087
Huh?
You look like a Darius.

809
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:20,711
- Alright! That's enough.
Really?

810
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:22,535
- Yeah!
Oh yeah? Really?

811
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:28,379
We're cool. Hey, hey, hey...
Don't look at me. He attacked me.

812
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:31,499
- That's enough friend.
Okay, fellas, it's two against one.

813
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:33,299
Come on.

814
00:55:33,419 --> 00:55:35,559
Where's your sense of sportsmanship?

815
00:55:36,683 --> 00:55:37,883
Stop!

816
00:55:39,907 --> 00:55:41,907
Be cool, alright?

817
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:45,009
We need to take those handcuffs off his
belt

818
00:55:45,033 --> 00:55:47,859
and handcuff one of his wrists, okay?

819
00:55:48,283 --> 00:55:50,383
Tell him.
- Do it.

820
00:55:54,807 --> 00:55:57,830
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey... steady.

821
00:55:58,139 --> 00:55:59,679
Now I have an idea.

822
00:55:59,699 --> 00:56:01,759
And I don't want you to panic.
Okay?

823
00:56:01,789 --> 00:56:03,899
Just go with me.

824
00:56:06,823 --> 00:56:08,023
Okay.

825
00:56:09,847 --> 00:56:11,047
Alright.

826
00:56:11,219 --> 00:56:12,479
Now.

827
00:56:13,699 --> 00:56:17,779
We're going to take a little walk
and you're going to introduce me

828
00:56:17,803 --> 00:56:19,803
to Mr. Jamshidi.

829
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:25,719
Alright, let's go
we're walking.

830
00:56:25,743 --> 00:56:32,999
Is that him? Huh?
Him? Okay.

831
00:56:33,029 --> 00:56:35,019
Not him. Huh?

832
00:56:35,419 --> 00:56:39,339
I'm Darius Jamshidi.

833
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,379
The real police will
be here in a few minutes

834
00:56:41,509 --> 00:56:45,219
but I'd be happy to
speak with you until then.

835
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:03,319
I see you're trying to buy
a television network, huh?

836
00:57:05,299 --> 00:57:05,919
Huh?

837
00:57:05,949 --> 00:57:09,799
This ends with you walking out
that door in a few minutes.

838
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:12,239
You sick Warren Gomes on me?

839
00:57:12,249 --> 00:57:16,019
i'm assume you sent those kids,
too. The Palisades Posse.

840
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:21,369
Question is, why do you want me
to stay away from the Pinch case?

841
00:57:24,139 --> 00:57:26,279
I don't know who you are.
- You met my wife?

842
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:28,599
But you just ruined my benefit

843
00:57:28,629 --> 00:57:33,189
and no doubt cost a very, very important
charity tens of thousands of dollars.

844
00:57:33,219 --> 00:57:35,159
Now I want you to go
release those two men.

845
00:57:35,179 --> 00:57:38,399
And I want you to unlock that one man's
ear from the other man's backside.

846
00:57:38,429 --> 00:57:39,719
I'll do that.

847
00:57:39,739 --> 00:57:41,385
My husband will show you
to the tennis courts.

848
00:57:41,409 --> 00:57:44,219
You'll find those men
there and your chain.

849
00:57:44,249 --> 00:57:46,859
Thank you.
- Asshole.

850
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:48,979
She seems very nice.

851
00:57:49,009 --> 00:57:51,379
This has been delightful.

852
00:57:51,409 --> 00:57:54,389
The wall past the next house backs
out onto Mulholland.

853
00:57:54,419 --> 00:57:58,549
If you'd be so kind as to
not cause any more drama in the party.

854
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:01,688
Tell me who Warren Gomes is.

855
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:03,329
Gomes' dead.

856
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,529
What are you talking about?

857
00:58:05,559 --> 00:58:07,329
I just spoke with the police.

858
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,369
Someone shot him
just before you arrived.

859
00:58:10,399 --> 00:58:13,929
It wasn't you perchance, was it?

860
00:58:13,959 --> 00:58:17,529
Why don't you tell me what
he was doing for you?

861
00:58:17,559 --> 00:58:21,601
Warren Gomes has...
had...

862
00:58:21,625 --> 00:58:24,559
a talent for special research,

863
00:58:24,439 --> 00:58:27,984
which allows my company to make
what it makes.

864
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:30,339
- Which is? 
Money.

865
00:58:31,479 --> 00:58:35,569
The goal is digging up dirt
to help you by the network.

866
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:39,589
Why do you want me to
stay away from Pinch?

867
00:58:41,989 --> 00:58:45,349
I believe that's for you.

868
00:59:06,173 --> 00:59:07,773
Waldo.

869
00:59:09,097 --> 00:59:10,397
Waldo.

870
00:59:29,021 --> 00:59:31,021
Alastair?

871
00:59:33,745 --> 00:59:35,645
Rosario?

872
00:59:38,269 --> 00:59:40,069
Alastair?

873
01:00:44,969 --> 01:00:47,609
Where is Alastair?

874
01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:56,132
Line?

875
01:00:56,156 --> 01:00:57,647
- I'll recuse myself if I have to.

876
01:00:57,671 --> 01:00:58,734
Shit!

877
01:00:58,757 --> 01:01:00,569
- And cut.
- I'll recuse myself if I have to.

878
01:01:00,593 --> 01:01:03,193
Must have been
distracted by her perfume.

879
01:01:04,909 --> 01:01:08,369
Things are getting fucking
strange and I need your help.

880
01:01:08,399 --> 01:01:10,889
Darius Jamshidi.

881
01:01:10,919 --> 01:01:13,079
That name mean anything to you?

882
01:01:13,109 --> 01:01:16,729
No, but Robert Blake called last night.

883
01:01:16,759 --> 01:01:20,009
Asked if I want to play pinochle
on Thursdays.

884
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:23,049
You do realize that everyone
is sure you did this.

885
01:01:23,069 --> 01:01:24,769
The only thing giving
me doubts is that

886
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:27,680
someone's busting my horns.
And me figuring out why,

887
01:01:27,804 --> 01:01:30,964
is the only thing standing between
you and a life sentence.

888
01:01:30,988 --> 01:01:35,649
So when I ask for help, I don't
know, maybe you should fucking help.

889
01:01:35,679 --> 01:01:38,629
Simmer down.
How can I be of service?

890
01:01:41,229 --> 01:01:44,269
Is there anything you're
not telling me?

891
01:01:44,309 --> 01:01:45,809
Like what?

892
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:48,129
Like did you invite someone
over to your house that night?

893
01:01:48,149 --> 01:01:49,289
No. 
- You sure?

894
01:01:49,319 --> 01:01:49,929
Absolutely.

895
01:01:49,949 --> 01:01:52,782
Could you invite someone over to the house
and not remember the next day?

896
01:01:52,806 --> 01:01:56,134
I've gotten married,
fathered children and taken out mortgages

897
01:01:56,158 --> 01:01:58,840
and not remembered the next day.

898
01:02:03,669 --> 01:02:05,449
When did you move the
furniture around?

899
01:02:05,479 --> 01:02:07,649
I told you Monica was
a constant tinkerer,

900
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:10,289
- She was never finished with anything...
The metal table in my room doesn't fit.

901
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,249
I'm thinking someone
moved it, from your room

902
01:02:12,269 --> 01:02:14,049
and the one in your room
from the living room.

903
01:02:14,069 --> 01:02:17,449
Probably on the night of the
murder. Unless you moved it since.

904
01:02:17,479 --> 01:02:21,109
I have not. Moved them. Since.
Piss off.

905
01:02:31,549 --> 01:02:34,389
What shall you do, Detective?

906
01:02:35,389 --> 01:02:39,449
If you find that I did,
in fact, murder my wife.

907
01:02:39,479 --> 01:02:42,569
Will you stand for your client
or...or for Truth and Justice

908
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:46,989
like the incorruptible
Charlie Waldo of yore?

909
01:02:50,829 --> 01:02:54,269
You stick with Truth
and Justice, Waldo.

910
01:02:54,509 --> 01:02:57,849
If I've killed my
little girl's mother,

911
01:02:57,879 --> 01:03:01,209
I'll take what's coming to me
and call it even.

912
01:03:04,533 --> 01:03:08,333
- Daddy!
- Ha! There's my darling.

913
01:03:08,357 --> 01:03:10,757
- I know all my lines for the play.

914
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:14,269
I can't wait to see your Rumpelstiltskin!
Come now.

915
01:03:14,293 --> 01:03:19,093
- Today I brew. Tomorrow I bake.
- And then the prince...

916
01:03:27,317 --> 01:03:29,717
Hey!
You sober enough to drive?

917
01:03:29,741 --> 01:03:31,541
I suppose so, why?

918
01:03:31,565 --> 01:03:33,365
Look, I'll meet you at your house.

919
01:03:33,389 --> 01:03:34,689
- Yeah?
Yeah.

920
01:03:34,713 --> 01:03:36,413
Just lock the door and
don't answer it.

921
01:03:39,109 --> 01:03:41,689
Hey!
Fuckhead!

922
01:03:41,719 --> 01:03:43,549
Tell me about Lorena.

923
01:03:43,879 --> 01:03:44,992
Fuck you.

924
01:03:45,116 --> 01:03:47,209
How about you tell me
about my mem?

925
01:03:47,233 --> 01:03:49,165
I don't know what
a fucking mem is!

926
01:03:49,189 --> 01:03:50,529
Tell me about my mem.

927
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:52,302
Who are you people?

928
01:03:52,326 --> 01:03:54,169
Cool your jets now.

929
01:03:55,269 --> 01:03:58,169
I think you're prevaricating, Waldo.

930
01:03:58,189 --> 01:03:59,508
She says she gave it to you.

931
01:03:59,509 --> 01:04:02,079
Last words the bitch ever said,
so I'm inclined to believe her.

932
01:04:02,109 --> 01:04:06,869
You know, she was still alive
when I put the gasoline on her.

933
01:04:09,989 --> 01:04:12,869
You dirty motherfucker.

934
01:04:17,693 --> 01:04:18,793
Waldo.

935
01:04:18,817 --> 01:04:20,117
Lorena.

936
01:04:20,141 --> 01:04:21,341
Waldo.

937
01:04:21,865 --> 01:04:23,665
You just had a concussion.

938
01:04:24,789 --> 01:04:26,589
Okay, can you focus?

939
01:04:28,544 --> 01:04:29,644
Yeah.

940
01:04:29,669 --> 01:04:33,829
The school nurse went home and
I said I'll take care of you.

941
01:04:33,853 --> 01:04:36,253
Oh, fuck is it?

942
01:04:36,309 --> 01:04:38,289
No, I'm sorry. I
shouldn't confuse you.

943
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:40,289
It's 4:30 in the afternoon.

944
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:42,148
You've just had a concussion.

945
01:04:43,272 --> 01:04:45,169
Okay, just go really slowly.

946
01:04:45,185 --> 01:04:47,569
I'll drop you off of Alastair's.

947
01:04:51,909 --> 01:04:53,729
A lot of traffic.

948
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:56,949
Thanks for taking me home.

949
01:04:57,229 --> 01:05:00,589
I might have a better idea.

950
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:04,569
Do you trust me?

951
01:05:04,599 --> 01:05:06,929
Why should I trust you?

952
01:05:06,959 --> 01:05:09,989
Because you'll like it.

953
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:56,709
Alright, well, this is me.

954
01:06:57,789 --> 01:06:59,079
Have a nice day.

955
01:06:59,109 --> 01:07:00,169
You too.

956
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:03,589
Doing whatever it is that you do.

957
01:07:04,189 --> 01:07:05,849
I'm late.

958
01:07:05,873 --> 01:07:07,473
I'll call you.

959
01:07:07,497 --> 01:07:09,097
I know you will.

960
01:07:09,121 --> 01:07:12,221
- Mr. Lion did you find my invitation?

961
01:07:13,445 --> 01:07:16,445
- What are you gonna do?
About what?

962
01:07:16,469 --> 01:07:18,469
Your mane is gone!

963
01:07:18,629 --> 01:07:21,289
- Can I tell you a secret?
Yes.

964
01:07:21,313 --> 01:07:23,513
It was stolen by a princess.

965
01:07:23,589 --> 01:07:26,489
- I will get it back for you, okay?
Will you?

966
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:27,395
Uh, huh.

967
01:07:27,419 --> 01:07:29,309
Thank you.

968
01:07:29,669 --> 01:07:32,389
You have a good day.
- I will.

969
01:08:08,613 --> 01:08:10,113
Yes!

970
01:08:10,137 --> 01:08:12,237
Fucking yes!

971
01:08:13,861 --> 01:08:15,549
Fucking yes!

972
01:08:15,673 --> 01:08:18,061
Yes!
Yes!

973
01:08:32,724 --> 01:08:33,724
Mem...

974
01:08:33,749 --> 01:08:36,229
Memory stick.

975
01:08:53,789 --> 01:08:57,789
Nini. It's your old friend, Waldo.

976
01:08:58,113 --> 01:08:59,913
What cat got your tounge?

977
01:09:00,989 --> 01:09:02,969
Tell your boss he can have his mem.

978
01:09:02,999 --> 01:09:07,029
Meet me tomorrow, Wilshire
and Catalina, 2 o'clock.

979
01:09:24,949 --> 01:09:28,695
Young man. Could I ask you to use your
earphones, please?

980
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:30,909
I mean, those are the rules.

981
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:36,002
Excuse me.
Who's that you're listening to?

982
01:09:36,026 --> 01:09:38,229
- Swag Doggg.
Swag Dog?

983
01:09:38,253 --> 01:09:39,265
That's it.

984
01:09:39,289 --> 01:09:41,209
Alright, thank you.

985
01:09:48,509 --> 01:09:49,588
We got to talk about it.

986
01:09:49,589 --> 01:09:50,929
It's all over social media.

987
01:09:50,949 --> 01:09:53,049
But you're the first hip-hop
artist we've seen

988
01:09:53,079 --> 01:09:55,549
spell his name D-O-G-G-G.

989
01:09:55,569 --> 01:09:56,969
What's that about?

990
01:09:56,989 --> 01:10:00,297
Well, you know, that third G is for
the big homie, god.

991
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:02,149
God baby.
- Praise the lord.

992
01:10:02,173 --> 01:10:04,173
- Immaculent concepted, you feeling me man?

993
01:10:04,269 --> 01:10:06,969
- Immaculent concept that pink purse
- from around your neck.

994
01:10:06,989 --> 01:10:09,269
- That's a Botega.
- That is a purse!

995
01:10:11,593 --> 01:10:12,993
I brush every...
-Morning!

996
01:10:13,117 --> 01:10:14,517
I brush every...
-Night!

997
01:10:14,541 --> 01:10:17,841
I brush and I brush till my teeth more...
- White!

998
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:20,465
Little dog.

999
01:10:20,469 --> 01:10:22,169
Hey, buddy.

1000
01:10:22,199 --> 01:10:24,689
Earphones. It's rules.

1001
01:10:24,709 --> 01:10:26,469
Sorry.

1002
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:38,509
Hello?
- Waldo?

1003
01:10:40,029 --> 01:10:43,649
Nice of you to call.
Where the hell are you?

1004
01:10:43,669 --> 01:10:45,289
I can't say.

1005
01:10:45,319 --> 01:10:49,049
Listen, there's a guy who's going to
reach out to you if he hasn't already.

1006
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:50,205
Oh, he has.

1007
01:10:50,229 --> 01:10:52,562
Okay, he's for real.
Don't mess around.

1008
01:10:52,586 --> 01:10:54,332
I know.
Everyone thinks he's killed you.

1009
01:10:54,359 --> 01:10:57,209
He can't.
If he can't find me.

1010
01:11:03,189 --> 01:11:06,389
Hi, I'm writing a piece for Esquire
on the new face of hip-hop?

1011
01:11:06,913 --> 01:11:08,413
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1012
01:11:08,509 --> 01:11:10,509
- Sir are you okay?

1013
01:11:10,749 --> 01:11:12,669
It's okay.
It's all right.

1014
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:14,309
Could I have that, please?

1015
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:15,245
Fucking...

1016
01:11:15,569 --> 01:11:18,789
Backup Nini.
It's all right, I got this.

1017
01:11:19,549 --> 01:11:22,809
It's pretty fucking bold of you
to be disrespecting me like that.

1018
01:11:22,829 --> 01:11:25,849
Especially in light of
Lorena's final hours.

1019
01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:29,009
You should have seen my fucking
eyes when I left that match, bro.

1020
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:31,049
She was crying, snot
coming down ner nose...

1021
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:34,369
I just talked to her.
Yeah.

1022
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:36,209
So why don't we cut the bullshit?

1023
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:40,949
And you tell me why Lorena was
messing with you in the first place?

1024
01:11:42,269 --> 01:11:46,649
Hey, if you don't want that flash drive,
I could always give it to the police.

1025
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:48,649
Go get yourself an
ice cream cone.

1026
01:11:48,669 --> 01:11:50,449
Get yourself an ice cream cone.

1027
01:11:50,479 --> 01:11:53,529
Strawberry.
Like your shirt.

1028
01:11:54,553 --> 01:11:57,953
Come on, relax. Relax.
You're so tense!

1029
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:00,649
Everything alright?
No problems at home?

1030
01:12:00,669 --> 01:12:04,729
I just want to know you can talk to
me, alright? About anything.

1031
01:12:04,749 --> 01:12:07,589
Lorena was working for me,
alright?

1032
01:12:09,049 --> 01:12:10,109
Not what you think.

1033
01:12:10,139 --> 01:12:14,729
Marital surveillance on behalf of my sister
watching my lazy ass brother in law.

1034
01:12:14,749 --> 01:12:17,489
Lorena comes to see me at this
chop shop I use as an office.

1035
01:12:17,509 --> 01:12:19,929
She sees my Mem sitting
there, the bitch palms it.

1036
01:12:19,949 --> 01:12:21,929
She walks out the office
like it's nothing.

1037
01:12:21,949 --> 01:12:25,769
Calls me later saying it's collateral
on what she claims I already owe her.

1038
01:12:25,789 --> 01:12:28,889
Alright, look, I think I got this.

1039
01:12:28,919 --> 01:12:31,529
You open to a suggestion?
- What you got?

1040
01:12:31,549 --> 01:12:33,449
Alright, I give you the mem.

1041
01:12:33,479 --> 01:12:35,409
You let Lorena come back to LA.

1042
01:12:35,439 --> 01:12:37,415
We walk up the rest in small claims.

1043
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:39,409
Simple.
- Yeah? It's so simple.

1044
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:41,565
I can't believe I didn't fucking
think of that.

1045
01:12:41,589 --> 01:12:43,090
What are you fucking nuts?

1046
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:45,869
I got a reputation to uphold Waldo.
Are you aware of that?

1047
01:12:45,893 --> 01:12:49,193
Assbags against the wall.
- Motherfucker!

1048
01:12:49,517 --> 01:12:52,769
If you're looking for Q's flash drive,
you're out of luck. I didn't bring it.

1049
01:12:52,789 --> 01:12:55,009
- What did you just say, Waldo?
Sorry.

1050
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:57,249
You got a permit for this?
- Nah.

1051
01:12:57,279 --> 01:13:02,779
I am arresting both of you for the
murder of Lorena Nascimento.

1052
01:13:03,749 --> 01:13:05,889
Want to read your boy here the
6 o'clock news or what?

1053
01:13:05,919 --> 01:13:08,329
Lorena's alive. I just talked to her.

1054
01:13:08,349 --> 01:13:10,089
What?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1055
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:11,209
Fuck.

1056
01:13:11,239 --> 01:13:12,849
Well, who was in her car then?

1057
01:13:12,869 --> 01:13:15,289
Can I say, you both suck at your jobs.

1058
01:13:15,309 --> 01:13:17,289
Cuppy was never going to book us anyway.

1059
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:19,569
Just another play to squeeze me.
Ain't that right, Cuppy?

1060
01:13:19,589 --> 01:13:21,636
You know, I'm the only one in town
who doesn't grease

1061
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:23,589
this motherfucking cock sucking
motherfucker.

1062
01:13:23,613 --> 01:13:25,805
Little man...
You...

1063
01:13:25,829 --> 01:13:29,277
You had better watch your mouth on days
that you're not followed around by that...

1064
01:13:29,301 --> 01:13:30,709
douchebag eskimo.

1065
01:13:31,033 --> 01:13:33,033
What?
What the f...

1066
01:13:34,959 --> 01:13:38,329
He's an Inuit. You fucking Philistine.

1067
01:13:38,353 --> 01:13:39,335
Let's go, Nini.

1068
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:41,609
You got another 24 hours, Waldo.

1069
01:13:41,629 --> 01:13:43,269
Okay.

1070
01:13:43,293 --> 01:13:45,893
Come on, let's get you up, Cuppy.

1071
01:13:49,229 --> 01:13:50,492
Hi.

1072
01:13:50,516 --> 01:13:53,011
Do you have a school
directory I can look at with the

1073
01:13:53,035 --> 01:13:55,529
names of the students in
each class and their parents?

1074
01:13:55,959 --> 01:13:58,669
It's for Jayne White.

1075
01:14:03,393 --> 01:14:04,893
Thank you.

1076
01:14:11,117 --> 01:14:13,117
Swag Doggg.

1077
01:14:15,641 --> 01:14:17,241
Jamshidi.

1078
01:14:17,949 --> 01:14:21,449
Listen, I'm onto something. What do you know
about Darius Jamshidi and Swag Doggg?

1079
01:14:21,473 --> 01:14:23,389
Are those animated characters?

1080
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,889
They both wanted me to stay
the hell away from your case.

1081
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:28,869
I went to the school today and checked
the directory. They're parents...

1082
01:14:29,469 --> 01:14:31,689
They're parents in your
daughter's class.

1083
01:14:31,709 --> 01:14:34,669
Now I'm thinking that Monica could have been
into something with these other parents

1084
01:14:34,689 --> 01:14:36,689
and one or more of them
wanted her dead.

1085
01:14:36,709 --> 01:14:39,449
The question is, though, what the fuck
is going on in that class?

1086
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:43,209
Well who knows? Show and tell.
Finger painting. I don't know.

1087
01:14:43,239 --> 01:14:47,249
Hey, Princess, I'm trying to save your
life. You want to cut the self pity?

1088
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:48,009
Self pity?

1089
01:14:48,029 --> 01:14:51,049
Look, you got a terrific little
girl. Who already lost her mom.

1090
01:14:51,079 --> 01:14:52,569
Does she have to lose her dad?

1091
01:14:52,589 --> 01:14:54,929
Nobody talks to me that way.
And you know why?

1092
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:55,809
Because they need the money.

1093
01:14:55,829 --> 01:14:57,609
No, because they know they'll
get a damn good drubbing.

1094
01:14:57,629 --> 01:15:00,529
Put'em up. Come on, your turn, Love.
You'll get a real fight.

1095
01:15:00,553 --> 01:15:02,553
I'm not doing this. I'm not doing this!
- Come on.

1096
01:15:02,877 --> 01:15:05,077
Alastair, you're too drunk!
- Slippery joker...

1097
01:15:05,101 --> 01:15:06,401
Alastair! 
- Hold still.

1098
01:15:06,425 --> 01:15:08,405
Not even if you weren't, like, twice my age.
- How am I supposed to...

1099
01:15:08,429 --> 01:15:12,429
Okay, look, I'm a pacifist. And I
refuse to get involved in...

1100
01:15:15,053 --> 01:15:16,253
Alastair?

1101
01:15:16,277 --> 01:15:19,077
Well done sir!
Have you have enough?

1102
01:15:19,309 --> 01:15:22,169
I've had enough.
- Let's you and I have a drink.

1103
01:15:22,199 --> 01:15:23,949
Help me up.

1104
01:15:24,709 --> 01:15:27,869
Oh, you've trimmed the
hedges, handsome devil.

1105
01:15:28,669 --> 01:15:31,129
You remember having mates,
don't you, Waldo?

1106
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:32,969
Not like you.

1107
01:15:33,549 --> 01:15:34,937
There you go.

1108
01:15:34,961 --> 01:15:39,149
You're right, of course.
I am shitfaced.

1109
01:15:39,189 --> 01:15:40,729
More than usual.

1110
01:15:40,749 --> 01:15:42,009
Chinchin.

1111
01:15:42,039 --> 01:15:46,129
You know what you should have done
when you're young man died?

1112
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:49,809
You should have gone on an epic,
two week, pub crawl.

1113
01:15:49,829 --> 01:15:53,429
Gotten it all out of your system.

1114
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:56,489
To self pity.

1115
01:15:56,509 --> 01:16:00,089
That was a powerful observation
coming from the master.

1116
01:16:00,119 --> 01:16:04,329
You and I are two sides of the
same coin, aren't we?

1117
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:05,969
And now here you are.

1118
01:16:05,999 --> 01:16:09,969
Back among the living in a way
you weren't just a week ago.

1119
01:16:09,999 --> 01:16:12,089
Oh and you see a difference?

1120
01:16:12,119 --> 01:16:14,209
All the difference in the world.

1121
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:17,129
Looking refuckulous, the way you
confronted me out there.

1122
01:16:17,149 --> 01:16:18,969
You didn't have that in you
when you first

1123
01:16:18,999 --> 01:16:23,409
shuffled onto my set with that rat's nest
of a beard and those dead eyes.

1124
01:16:23,439 --> 01:16:28,298
You've been brought back a life, mate. Like
so many of us...

1125
01:16:28,322 --> 01:16:30,539
by singular carnal charms.

1126
01:16:35,669 --> 01:16:39,129
Is Jayne keeping with the baby?

1127
01:16:39,149 --> 01:16:40,649
I think about it all the time,

1128
01:16:40,669 --> 01:16:44,049
but I haven't thought it right to
telephone, given the circumstances.

1129
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:46,169
And I was such a cad.

1130
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:48,386
Especially after she told me.

1131
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:51,569
Well, I was married, after all,
and what was I to do?

1132
01:16:51,589 --> 01:16:55,629
And then after the business
with my sweet Monica...

1133
01:16:55,829 --> 01:16:59,509
I'm tired, Waldo.

1134
01:17:00,789 --> 01:17:06,769
Fearing that you may not be as good
as others believe is common to all men.

1135
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:12,289
But fearing that deep down
you may be a monster.

1136
01:17:12,709 --> 01:17:16,589
That's a whole different flavor of hell.

1137
01:17:52,149 --> 01:17:55,009
You should have told me about
you and Alastair.

1138
01:17:55,029 --> 01:17:58,869
There's nothing to tell you,
he's a kindergarten dad.

1139
01:18:04,269 --> 01:18:07,269
Don't worry it's not Alastair.
It's me.

1140
01:18:07,509 --> 01:18:10,249
I found this burner in his house.
On the night his wife died

1141
01:18:10,279 --> 01:18:13,875
he texted back and forth with
someone inviting her over.

1142
01:18:13,899 --> 01:18:15,089
Someone...

1143
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:18,549
said she'd be right there.

1144
01:18:18,973 --> 01:18:20,435
Come on.

1145
01:18:20,459 --> 01:18:22,473
Let's talk.

1146
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:31,329
Did you have a thing
with Swag Dogg, too?

1147
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:33,109
Yes.

1148
01:18:33,389 --> 01:18:36,589
And that crazy rich guy, Jamshidi?

1149
01:18:39,069 --> 01:18:43,609
You know, I've been getting beaten up and
threatened all week because of you.

1150
01:18:43,629 --> 01:18:45,409
It had nothing to do
with Monica Pinch.

1151
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:48,489
It was a bunch of rich guys that didn't
want their affairs with you exposed.

1152
01:18:48,509 --> 01:18:50,290
What do you want, Waldo?

1153
01:18:50,314 --> 01:18:53,849
I'm a thrill seeker and I'm
teaching fucking kindergarten.

1154
01:18:53,869 --> 01:18:56,460
What could be a bigger rush
than sleeping with the Detective

1155
01:18:56,484 --> 01:18:59,009
investigating a death you're involved in?

1156
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:04,539
It wasn't just that.
I really felt something.

1157
01:19:07,589 --> 01:19:09,369
Start from the beginning.

1158
01:19:09,399 --> 01:19:11,969
And no bullshit.

1159
01:19:14,069 --> 01:19:18,769
I was hoping that he would leave
his wife, but he was an asshole.

1160
01:19:18,789 --> 01:19:23,809
And he kept talking about how she wanted
him to move back to England with her.

1161
01:19:23,829 --> 01:19:27,249
Like he didn't give a shit
about what I was telling him.

1162
01:19:27,279 --> 01:19:31,009
And after that total radio silence.

1163
01:19:31,039 --> 01:19:36,049
But I kept texting him, which was
probably stupid.

1164
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:41,579
And then one night, he messaged me back,
saying that Monica was out the house and I

1165
01:19:41,669 --> 01:19:45,769
should come over and we could talk about
us. And before I can even ring the bell.

1166
01:19:45,789 --> 01:19:49,369
Monica opens the door and
tells me to come inside.

1167
01:19:49,399 --> 01:19:51,049
She's holding his phone.

1168
01:19:51,079 --> 01:19:53,369
She's the one who
messaged me to come over.

1169
01:19:53,399 --> 01:20:00,399
She tells me Alastairs passed out in the
study and she wanted to see who it was.

1170
01:20:00,789 --> 01:20:03,882
When she found out it was
her daughter's teacher, she got...

1171
01:20:03,906 --> 01:20:06,979
pretty unhinged... 
kept talking about...

1172
01:20:07,003 --> 01:20:15,289
how L.A. was this evil city and
what a mistake it was coming to L.A.

1173
01:20:16,589 --> 01:20:19,817
I was scared she was going
to get violent. So...

1174
01:20:20,341 --> 01:20:23,729
I just ran out of there.
I drove away.

1175
01:20:24,309 --> 01:20:26,269
And then...

1176
01:20:27,509 --> 01:20:31,109
the next day, I heard
Monica was dead.

1177
01:20:31,229 --> 01:20:37,529
And I tried reaching out to Alastair,
but he was even more of an asshole.

1178
01:20:37,529 --> 01:20:42,949
He wouldn't talk to me, not even
when he was dropping Gaby off.

1179
01:20:43,829 --> 01:20:45,172
So...

1180
01:20:46,396 --> 01:20:50,449
when... when uh... when the chips started
falling on him...

1181
01:20:53,673 --> 01:20:56,373
and I just let them fall.

1182
01:20:59,629 --> 01:21:04,009
And you're pregnant?
Alastairs?

1183
01:21:08,909 --> 01:21:12,609
Jayne, we're about to start.

1184
01:21:12,629 --> 01:21:14,389
Yeah.

1185
01:21:14,789 --> 01:21:16,177
Be right there.

1186
01:21:16,201 --> 01:21:18,989
Can we pick this up later?

1187
01:21:20,189 --> 01:21:23,413
After the play I'm all yours.

1188
01:21:27,234 --> 01:21:29,734
First her necklace.
Then her ring.

1189
01:21:29,758 --> 01:21:33,958
Next I'll take, the child as the king!

1190
01:21:33,959 --> 01:21:37,447
Today I brew.
Tomorrow I bake.

1191
01:21:37,471 --> 01:21:41,959
And then the Prince child I'll take!

1192
01:21:41,983 --> 01:21:48,183
But no one knows, my little game,
and Rumpelstiltskin is my name!

1193
01:21:49,807 --> 01:21:53,207
Because my name...
she'll never guess!

1194
01:22:03,831 --> 01:22:05,331
Jayne?

1195
01:22:46,155 --> 01:22:48,055
That girl from Louisiana,
Laura, what's her name?

1196
01:22:48,069 --> 01:22:49,409
Yeah. I need you to call her agent.

1197
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:52,511
Yeah, I mean, is she pregnant or is it...
I don't know, she's unhappy?

1198
01:22:52,535 --> 01:22:53,889
Because it's weird. I mean...

1199
01:22:53,919 --> 01:22:58,349
I don't know if she changed what she's
eating, but, you tell me. But they're

1200
01:22:58,369 --> 01:23:03,469
feeding her something very strange because
I've never seen a shape quite like that.

1201
01:23:03,589 --> 01:23:07,729
Wobbling through the lot. And I was
like, It's not going to work because

1202
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:12,601
I don't want to look at that. Alright, well
you tell her. Alright, bye.

1203
01:23:12,625 --> 01:23:14,209
Mr. Waldo.

1204
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:15,569
Mr. Sikorsky.

1205
01:23:15,589 --> 01:23:17,409
Apologies for the
interruption but

1206
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:18,489
I made some progress.

1207
01:23:18,509 --> 01:23:21,009
Oh, you did! Fantastic.

1208
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:22,129
What is that?

1209
01:23:22,149 --> 01:23:26,729
That, my friend, is signed by every
quarterback who ever won two Super Bowls.

1210
01:23:26,749 --> 01:23:29,169
May I?
- Please. Be my guest.

1211
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:32,020
May I also say it is so good
to see your baby face

1212
01:23:32,044 --> 01:23:33,929
peeking out where once
a dead animal lay.

1213
01:23:33,949 --> 01:23:36,329
And just when you thought I
couldn't get any more handsome.

1214
01:23:36,349 --> 01:23:38,789
I, uh, have a run through but, um...

1215
01:23:38,989 --> 01:23:41,468
Fuck'em, I want to hear this.
Shoot.

1216
01:23:41,492 --> 01:23:45,689
It's good news, I guess.
I know who killed Monica Pinch.

1217
01:23:45,709 --> 01:23:46,729
Fantastic.

1218
01:23:46,749 --> 01:23:48,549
I mean.

1219
01:23:50,669 --> 01:23:53,569
There's a young lady named Jayne White.

1220
01:23:53,589 --> 01:23:56,209
She was the Pinch girls
kindergarten teacher.

1221
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:59,449
Why did kindergarten teacher
want to kill Monica Pinch for?

1222
01:23:59,469 --> 01:24:02,589
She and Alastair were having an affair.

1223
01:24:04,029 --> 01:24:05,449
You don't look surprised.

1224
01:24:05,479 --> 01:24:07,729
They have a
complicated marriage.

1225
01:24:07,749 --> 01:24:09,249
You knew them pretty well?

1226
01:24:09,279 --> 01:24:11,689
Knew them well?
We did St. Barts last year.

1227
01:24:11,709 --> 01:24:15,529
I'm just so fucking relieved
it's not Alastair, you know?

1228
01:24:15,549 --> 01:24:16,689
You know, I knew you were my guy.

1229
01:24:16,709 --> 01:24:19,769
Fontella said, "Don't hire that bum.
He stinks in every way."

1230
01:24:19,789 --> 01:24:21,809
But I was like
"No, that's my guy."

1231
01:24:21,829 --> 01:24:23,809
And do I know casting
or do I know casting?

1232
01:24:23,829 --> 01:24:26,812
Is this chick in custody.
Are we good?

1233
01:24:26,936 --> 01:24:28,549
Jayne?
- Yeah.

1234
01:24:28,669 --> 01:24:29,849
No.

1235
01:24:29,869 --> 01:24:30,847
No, she left town.

1236
01:24:30,871 --> 01:24:34,129
Ah, we'll find her. She's a fucking
kindergarten teacher, not Whitey Bulger.

1237
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:37,089
That's a win-win for Waldo and Sikorsky.
You get the killer.

1238
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:38,569
I get to keep my syndication.

1239
01:24:38,589 --> 01:24:43,489
I mean, it's a tragedy. But, you know, as
tragedies go... But thank you.

1240
01:24:43,499 --> 01:24:45,142
You know, great job and...

1241
01:24:45,166 --> 01:24:47,509
Did you know Jayne White?

1242
01:24:48,589 --> 01:24:50,089
I know... of her.

1243
01:24:50,109 --> 01:24:51,929
Did you know that
Alastair got her pregnant?

1244
01:24:51,959 --> 01:24:52,900
Hey...

1245
01:24:52,924 --> 01:24:55,769
I'm just wondering if that was
something many people were aware of.

1246
01:24:55,789 --> 01:24:57,982
Many people? No.
This is the inner circle stuff.

1247
01:24:58,006 --> 01:25:00,329
Right but... You're in the inner circle.

1248
01:25:00,359 --> 01:25:03,989
I founded the inner circle. You know, he knows
what I'm doing, if you know what I mean.

1249
01:25:04,009 --> 01:25:05,769
I know what he's doing,
if you know what I mean.

1250
01:25:05,789 --> 01:25:09,049
So what was Monica Pinch's reaction when
she found out Jayne White was pregnant?

1251
01:25:09,069 --> 01:25:10,569
She was devastated.
- I bet.

1252
01:25:10,589 --> 01:25:11,434
I mean, she probably

1253
01:25:11,458 --> 01:25:14,015
pushed Alastair even harder to quit
the show and move back to England.

1254
01:25:14,039 --> 01:25:16,835
I can't speak to that because I don't
know her as well as I know him.

1255
01:25:16,859 --> 01:25:18,050
Right.

1256
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:21,689
But you knew about the awards, the
Shakespeare rewards you talked about.

1257
01:25:21,709 --> 01:25:24,629
They're called Regis, by the way.
What did you say?

1258
01:25:24,659 --> 01:25:27,209
You said, "They were all under the bed."

1259
01:25:27,229 --> 01:25:30,142
Under the bed, in the attic. Didn't
matter. He just didn't want them around.

1260
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:31,809
Ah. Gotcha.
It's funny...

1261
01:25:31,829 --> 01:25:33,754
They actually were under the bed.
- So?

1262
01:25:33,778 --> 01:25:36,455
It's just Alastair said he wasn't sure
where they were. It's not a big deal.

1263
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:39,929
Listen, this is great chatting with
you, but time is not my friend.

1264
01:25:39,949 --> 01:25:40,847
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1265
01:25:40,871 --> 01:25:41,609
I'll let you go.

1266
01:25:41,629 --> 01:25:42,929
Thanks.

1267
01:25:42,959 --> 01:25:44,569
Monica Pinch.

1268
01:25:44,589 --> 01:25:45,649
Quickly.

1269
01:25:45,669 --> 01:25:46,889
Monica Pinch.

1270
01:25:46,909 --> 01:25:50,409
Now she didn't find out that Jayne White
was pregnant until the night she died.

1271
01:25:50,439 --> 01:25:52,209
So if she talked to you about it,

1272
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:54,729
it must have been then, right?

1273
01:25:54,759 --> 01:26:00,189
Ah... I'm gonna have to back
you up a second there, Mr. Waldo.

1274
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:03,142
You said that Jayne White
was the murderer.

1275
01:26:03,166 --> 01:26:06,209
Oh, no, I said
I knew who the murderer was.

1276
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:07,989
Oh.

1277
01:26:09,949 --> 01:26:11,249
Warren Gomes.

1278
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:13,169
Does that name mean anything to you?

1279
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:15,009
- No.
Well, he was this lawyer.

1280
01:26:15,029 --> 01:26:16,649
I had a little bit of a weird
thing with him.

1281
01:26:16,669 --> 01:26:18,095
He kept following me for a couple of days,

1282
01:26:18,119 --> 01:26:21,089
and I kind of lost my temper,
and I confronted him one day.

1283
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:22,169
We got into a little fight.

1284
01:26:22,199 --> 01:26:24,169
A couple of hours later, he got killed.

1285
01:26:24,189 --> 01:26:26,609
- Yeah? 
I'm just trying to piece everything together.

1286
01:26:26,629 --> 01:26:29,129
The question is, why I bring it up...

1287
01:26:29,159 --> 01:26:32,289
He had the same kind of watch as you.
- Rich lawyer.

1288
01:26:32,309 --> 01:26:34,308
That's what I thought.
Only I researched them.

1289
01:26:34,309 --> 01:26:35,809
They're all individually made, right?

1290
01:26:35,829 --> 01:26:38,929
No two are identical.
Here's the thing.

1291
01:26:38,949 --> 01:26:41,529
The one he was wearing.
It looked a lot like yours.

1292
01:26:41,549 --> 01:26:43,449
Pure coincidence.
This one hasn't left my wrist,

1293
01:26:43,479 --> 01:26:45,049
except when I shower and sleep.

1294
01:26:45,079 --> 01:26:46,925
But you asked Fontella what time it was.

1295
01:26:46,949 --> 01:26:47,790
What?
When?

1296
01:26:47,809 --> 01:26:50,409
At the courthouse.
After Alastair's arraignment.

1297
01:26:50,439 --> 01:26:54,929
I'm afraid you must be mistaken.
But, uh... Oh, fuck it.

1298
01:26:54,959 --> 01:26:56,089
Take a seat.

1299
01:26:56,109 --> 01:26:58,835
I want to hear everything you're
thinking. Soup to nuts. Alright?

1300
01:26:58,859 --> 01:27:00,038
- Soup to nuts?
Yes, please.

1301
01:27:00,062 --> 01:27:01,229
Double fuck the return.

1302
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:03,409
Let's do that.
- Let's do it. You sure?

1303
01:27:03,439 --> 01:27:04,889
Yes, sir.

1304
01:27:04,919 --> 01:27:07,149
Buckle up.

1305
01:27:09,029 --> 01:27:11,589
Well, I'm thinking...

1306
01:27:12,549 --> 01:27:15,495
that you knew what Monica Pinch
kept under her bed

1307
01:27:15,519 --> 01:27:18,442
because you were spending time in her bedroom

1308
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:21,389
while Alastair was spending time with Jayne.

1309
01:27:23,629 --> 01:27:27,869
Mr. Waldo, that is brilliant.

1310
01:27:28,309 --> 01:27:30,880
I'm thinking that
on the night she found out

1311
01:27:30,904 --> 01:27:33,850
that he'd gotten Jayne pregnant
with Alastair passed out cold.

1312
01:27:33,869 --> 01:27:35,729
I'm thinking that Monica called you

1313
01:27:35,749 --> 01:27:38,428
to tell you she was going to
tell Alastair about your affair,

1314
01:27:38,429 --> 01:27:41,169
to get him to quit the show and move back
to England like she'd been wanting.

1315
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:42,649
But you couldn't
afford to lose Alastair.

1316
01:27:42,669 --> 01:27:44,809
Not with the Jamshidi takeover threat.

1317
01:27:44,829 --> 01:27:48,089
I'm thinking... that you drove over there.

1318
01:27:48,109 --> 01:27:51,609
You were going to talk some sense into
Monica but she didn't want to hear it.

1319
01:27:51,629 --> 01:27:55,231
Next thing you guys are arguing, it
escalates and you pick up the Regis Award

1320
01:27:55,255 --> 01:27:56,809
and you hit her with it.

1321
01:27:56,829 --> 01:27:57,969
You didn't mean to do it.

1322
01:27:57,999 --> 01:28:00,502
It's an act of passion.
Thing is she's hit her head

1323
01:28:00,526 --> 01:28:03,729
on the way down and now she's not moving.
So you panic.

1324
01:28:03,749 --> 01:28:06,409
You start wiping down everything
you can remember touching.

1325
01:28:06,439 --> 01:28:10,209
But the Regis Award was on a wooden
table and that had blood stains on it.

1326
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:12,875
Now I'm thinking, I'm just thinking,

1327
01:28:12,899 --> 01:28:16,089
maybe you were worried that
some of that was your blood.

1328
01:28:16,119 --> 01:28:17,969
You could have got cut in the fight.

1329
01:28:17,999 --> 01:28:20,089
So now what do you do?

1330
01:28:20,119 --> 01:28:21,969
You swap around some furniture.

1331
01:28:21,989 --> 01:28:25,409
You set the alarm on the way out. You
get rid of the Regis in some dumpster.

1332
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:30,569
And you let poor old Alastair
wake up to take the rap.

1333
01:28:30,599 --> 01:28:32,989
How did I do?

1334
01:28:37,329 --> 01:28:40,169
Come on.
And the lawyer guy?

1335
01:28:40,199 --> 01:28:44,029
He blackmailed you.
Even made your cough up that fancy watch

1336
01:28:44,059 --> 01:28:48,149
which you couldn't resist
taking back after you shot him.

1337
01:28:51,269 --> 01:28:53,969
That is quite brilliant.

1338
01:28:53,999 --> 01:28:56,089
In fact, I should give
you a pilot deal.

1339
01:28:56,109 --> 01:28:58,730
There is one gaping hole in
your narrative, however,

1340
01:28:58,754 --> 01:29:01,530
why would I sabotage the
biggest asset on this network?

1341
01:29:01,549 --> 01:29:02,809
Come on. That's the easy part.

1342
01:29:02,829 --> 01:29:06,009
You told me yourself the scandal
made the show twice as valuable.

1343
01:29:06,029 --> 01:29:08,129
You knew Alastair would get off,
I mean, it's L.A.

1344
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:10,009
the star always gets off.

1345
01:29:10,039 --> 01:29:13,929
And in the meantime, the more
publicity, the bigger the windfall.

1346
01:29:13,959 --> 01:29:15,449
So what do you do?

1347
01:29:15,479 --> 01:29:18,062
You hire the lawyer who
will make the most noise,

1348
01:29:18,086 --> 01:29:20,009
and then the Detective
who would make the most noise.

1349
01:29:20,239 --> 01:29:24,129
Even though your lawyer kept telling
you I'd be a shitty choice.

1350
01:29:24,149 --> 01:29:25,969
And let's be honest, I am a shitty choice.

1351
01:29:25,989 --> 01:29:28,469
I've never been a P.I.
The LAPD fucking hates me.

1352
01:29:28,499 --> 01:29:31,129
I'm so rusty. I'd probably be useless.

1353
01:29:31,159 --> 01:29:34,869
But I think you like
me for those reasons,

1354
01:29:35,109 --> 01:29:36,889
because that made me the last Detective

1355
01:29:36,919 --> 01:29:41,549
who would ever figure out
that you killed Monica Pinch.

1356
01:29:41,829 --> 01:29:44,709
and Warren Gomes.

1357
01:29:47,109 --> 01:29:49,849
A lot of moving parts.

1358
01:29:50,279 --> 01:29:52,989
A lot of moving parts.

1359
01:29:55,709 --> 01:29:58,289
I do have one question.

1360
01:29:58,319 --> 01:30:03,819
What made you so sure that you walk in
here and deliver that little pitch?

1361
01:30:07,149 --> 01:30:09,289
I'll be honest.

1362
01:30:09,319 --> 01:30:12,829
I only walked in 98% sure.
- Oh.

1363
01:30:15,949 --> 01:30:17,549
What was the other 2%.

1364
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:21,389
I had to make sure you were a lefty.

1365
01:30:24,589 --> 01:30:26,889
I did make one mistake, though.

1366
01:30:26,919 --> 01:30:30,809
I really should have waited
until the cops got here.

1367
01:30:30,829 --> 01:30:32,969
You told them to come.

1368
01:30:32,989 --> 01:30:35,409
Well, if I timed it right,
they're already downstairs.

1369
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:37,189
Of course.

1370
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:40,069
I don't have to watch.

1371
01:30:43,989 --> 01:30:46,569
Now you just keep smiling.

1372
01:30:46,599 --> 01:30:48,829
Watch your head.

1373
01:30:50,069 --> 01:30:52,009
Come on, look lively fellas.

1374
01:30:52,039 --> 01:30:53,729
Pete couldn't make it himself?

1375
01:30:53,749 --> 01:30:55,889
You know he's not going to let you
have this collar, right?

1376
01:30:55,909 --> 01:30:58,949
I'm going to head to North Hollywood
 tell Pete I'll meet him there.

1377
01:30:58,973 --> 01:31:00,873
See you in court!

1378
01:31:00,897 --> 01:31:02,948
What are you doing?

1379
01:31:02,972 --> 01:31:04,697
Get off my bike!

1380
01:31:06,189 --> 01:31:07,729
We're not cops man, we're extras.

1381
01:31:07,749 --> 01:31:09,529
Shut the fuck up.

1382
01:31:12,553 --> 01:31:13,541
Fuck.

1383
01:31:14,365 --> 01:31:15,353
Fuck!

1384
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:55,770
Fuck!

1385
01:33:02,869 --> 01:33:08,669
- ...for Lady Justice. Make sure that neither
- predjudice, nor predisposition interfere...

1386
01:33:10,794 --> 01:33:11,794
Fuck!

1387
01:33:11,818 --> 01:33:15,118
- ...for 99 days, you do that, and Justice...

1388
01:33:17,942 --> 01:33:19,142
- ...but Johnny, he'd say...

1389
01:33:19,666 --> 01:33:23,866
- on the 100th day, a great judge...

1390
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:26,890
- knows that he needs to be, Justice.

1391
01:33:29,114 --> 01:33:30,422
Ready for your close up?

1392
01:33:30,446 --> 01:33:31,914
Wait! Wait!

1393
01:33:31,938 --> 01:33:33,405
- I do know that as I sit here today...

1394
01:33:33,429 --> 01:33:35,169
How are you going to get away with this?

1395
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:37,889
A light fell on set, happens all the time.

1396
01:33:37,919 --> 01:33:40,149
Last looks.

1397
01:33:42,673 --> 01:33:44,473
- That this here defendant...

1398
01:33:44,697 --> 01:33:46,697
Guilty.

1399
01:33:57,589 --> 01:34:00,887
What the fuck.
This place is falling apart.

1400
01:34:00,911 --> 01:34:02,402
Waldo.

1401
01:34:02,426 --> 01:34:03,789
Thank you.

1402
01:34:11,813 --> 01:34:14,013
Well, that's that then.
- Yup.

1403
01:34:14,109 --> 01:34:16,649
Would it be ungrateful to
ask what you're doing here.

1404
01:34:16,669 --> 01:34:19,929
I've been following you since
the recruiting office.

1405
01:34:19,959 --> 01:34:22,889
We even had to sit through that
Rumpelstiltskin bullshit.

1406
01:34:22,919 --> 01:34:24,279
Really?
- Yeah.

1407
01:34:25,103 --> 01:34:26,929
How'd you get on the lot?

1408
01:34:26,959 --> 01:34:29,769
Snuck in on a studio tour.
Yeah.

1409
01:34:29,789 --> 01:34:31,449
They really need to check
out their security.

1410
01:34:31,479 --> 01:34:34,669
I could be like a crazy stalker
or something, you know?

1411
01:34:34,689 --> 01:34:37,609
I, uh, I hope you don't mind.
I used your gun.

1412
01:34:38,349 --> 01:34:40,849
I was never here.

1413
01:34:40,869 --> 01:34:42,962
Yeah, I can work with that.

1414
01:34:42,986 --> 01:34:44,009
Grand.

1415
01:34:45,039 --> 01:34:48,509
You do know why I saved your ass, right?

1416
01:34:48,629 --> 01:34:51,069
Yeah. I got an idea.

1417
01:34:53,269 --> 01:34:54,609
Someone else kills you first.

1418
01:34:54,629 --> 01:34:56,609
I can't get what I want.
It will be a mess.

1419
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:58,889
Nobody will know what
to do with themselves.

1420
01:34:58,919 --> 01:35:01,049
You know, I got to thank you.

1421
01:35:01,069 --> 01:35:04,769
It's not too clever keeping your kind
of business records in a flash drive.

1422
01:35:04,789 --> 01:35:07,529
Is that what Cuppy thinks is on there?

1423
01:35:07,559 --> 01:35:09,491
Business records...

1424
01:35:10,215 --> 01:35:12,344
Guys an idiot.

1425
01:35:12,368 --> 01:35:15,089
Why?
What is on there?

1426
01:35:16,069 --> 01:35:18,469
Epic poem.

1427
01:35:18,949 --> 01:35:20,849
Long ass motherfucker, too.

1428
01:35:20,869 --> 01:35:23,089
It's the only copy I got.

1429
01:35:23,119 --> 01:35:25,049
Epic poem that you wrote?

1430
01:35:25,079 --> 01:35:27,049
Yeah, that I wrote.

1431
01:35:27,069 --> 01:35:28,849
It's about the life of a dealer trying

1432
01:35:28,869 --> 01:35:34,009
to retain his independence and integrity
in an era of corporate style cartels.

1433
01:35:34,039 --> 01:35:35,897
Why an epic poem?

1434
01:35:35,921 --> 01:35:39,609
See me, I'm an autodidact.
It means I'm self educated.

1435
01:35:39,639 --> 01:35:41,169
I had to enrich my own life.

1436
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:44,729
But my little girl, Dulce,

1437
01:35:44,749 --> 01:35:48,409
I'm going to make sure my
daughter gets a real education.

1438
01:35:48,439 --> 01:35:50,489
That way, she ain't stuck being no cop.

1439
01:35:50,519 --> 01:35:51,849
No dealer.

1440
01:35:51,869 --> 01:35:57,069
I want to give the poem to her. So
she can see the man I really am.

1441
01:35:57,669 --> 01:36:00,049
Waldo, I need my mem.

1442
01:36:00,079 --> 01:36:03,689
I need Lorena to come back, so...

1443
01:36:03,709 --> 01:36:05,329
I'll tell you what.

1444
01:36:05,359 --> 01:36:09,249
I want you to get my little girl
into that fancy ass private school.

1445
01:36:09,269 --> 01:36:11,490
Same one as that British dude's kid.

1446
01:36:11,514 --> 01:36:14,689
Get him to help Dulce
and bring me back my mem.

1447
01:36:14,709 --> 01:36:16,409
And Lorena can come back.

1448
01:36:16,439 --> 01:36:18,869
Have you got the juice for that?

1449
01:36:18,899 --> 01:36:21,349
You know, I just might.

1450
01:36:24,509 --> 01:36:25,889
Okay, Waldo.

1451
01:36:25,919 --> 01:36:29,429
You got another 24 hours.

1452
01:36:30,069 --> 01:36:35,109
By the way,
I love Johnny's Bench.

1453
01:36:40,549 --> 01:36:44,709
You know, my
granddaddy once said

1454
01:36:47,149 --> 01:36:50,969
"It's one thing to
write like a poet."

1455
01:36:50,999 --> 01:36:55,829
"And another thing altogether,
to write like a historian."

1456
01:36:57,149 --> 01:37:03,416
"A poet can rehash or sing
about things, not like they were,"

1457
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:06,709
"but like
they should have been."

1458
01:37:07,469 --> 01:37:10,189
"And the historian..."

1459
01:37:10,709 --> 01:37:13,775
"Well, he's got to write about them,
not like they should have been,"

1460
01:37:13,799 --> 01:37:15,475
Fucking Lorena.

1461
01:37:15,499 --> 01:37:17,699
"but like they were."

1462
01:37:19,069 --> 01:37:23,869
"Without adding or subtracting
anything from the truth."

1463
01:37:24,069 --> 01:37:25,829
And might I remind you, Counselor,

1464
01:37:25,859 --> 01:37:28,809
you're getting dangerously
close to ruffling my feathers.

1465
01:37:28,829 --> 01:37:31,649
Do you understand the words
contempt of court?

1466
01:37:31,669 --> 01:37:33,429
Come in.

1467
01:37:34,330 --> 01:37:36,689
Fuck!
The man of the hour.

1468
01:37:36,709 --> 01:37:37,769
Come here.

1469
01:37:37,789 --> 01:37:40,969
Deftly done me old cockalorum.
No tongues.

1470
01:37:40,993 --> 01:37:42,645
Come and sit down.
Sit.

1471
01:37:42,669 --> 01:37:45,709
I want a lavish praise on you.

1472
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:48,689
Is it too much of a cliché to say,

1473
01:37:48,709 --> 01:37:50,089
I don't know how to thank you?

1474
01:37:50,109 --> 01:37:53,049
Is it too much of a cliché to say,
I might have an idea?

1475
01:37:53,079 --> 01:37:53,935
Shoot.

1476
01:37:53,959 --> 01:37:56,549
I'm thinking you were right
about that epic two week pub crawl.

1477
01:37:56,579 --> 01:37:58,089
That's a brilliant idea.

1478
01:37:58,119 --> 01:38:01,549
Unfortunately, as of today,

1479
01:38:02,989 --> 01:38:06,709
this is my liquor of choice.

1480
01:38:08,069 --> 01:38:09,209
Sober is a judge.

1481
01:38:09,239 --> 01:38:11,529
Yes, very good.

1482
01:38:11,559 --> 01:38:16,249
I may drop dead any second, but
at least now I'm not inviting it.

1483
01:38:16,269 --> 01:38:18,969
I made a shambles of everything, Waldo.

1484
01:38:18,999 --> 01:38:20,289
Monica's gone.

1485
01:38:20,309 --> 01:38:24,249
Jayne's run off with a son or
daughter I may never know.

1486
01:38:24,279 --> 01:38:28,249
On the other hand, I
do have my sweet Gaby.

1487
01:38:28,279 --> 01:38:31,689
The least I owe her
is the best I have.

1488
01:38:31,709 --> 01:38:34,569
Now that could take more courage than
drinking yourself to death.

1489
01:38:34,599 --> 01:38:37,149
Don't I know it.

1490
01:38:37,469 --> 01:38:39,789
Courage, mate.
- Cheers

1491
01:38:41,149 --> 01:38:42,329
We're ready for you, Mr. Pinch.

1492
01:38:42,349 --> 01:38:43,869
Yes.
Let's off.

1493
01:38:43,889 --> 01:38:46,089
And, uh, don't tell
anyone about this.

1494
01:38:46,109 --> 01:38:47,388
They think I'm still a drunk.

1495
01:38:47,389 --> 01:38:50,549
They'll still let me paste the
occasional pretty boy.

1496
01:39:02,269 --> 01:39:04,349
I got your text.

1497
01:39:05,509 --> 01:39:08,169
Thanks for squaring
things with Q.

1498
01:39:08,199 --> 01:39:10,889
And yet all you talked
about was Pinch.

1499
01:39:10,919 --> 01:39:12,809
I wanted you to do that, too.

1500
01:39:12,829 --> 01:39:15,609
Hope it didn't cause you too much trouble.
- Oh, not at all.

1501
01:39:15,639 --> 01:39:17,889
Made some new friends.

1502
01:39:17,919 --> 01:39:19,234
Well, if you're up for it,

1503
01:39:19,258 --> 01:39:21,429
got something else
we could work together.

1504
01:39:21,449 --> 01:39:23,989
You know, I don't think my face can
take much more of your action.

1505
01:39:24,109 --> 01:39:25,369
Stop being such a Princess.

1506
01:39:25,399 --> 01:39:28,569
You know you loved every minute of it.

1507
01:39:28,599 --> 01:39:30,209
You look good.

1508
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:33,489
Yeah, you look pretty good
yourself. For a dead woman.

1509
01:39:33,509 --> 01:39:34,642
How'd you pull that off?

1510
01:39:34,666 --> 01:39:36,820
A coroner down in San Berdoo
owed me a favor.

1511
01:39:36,844 --> 01:39:39,500
They let me have a Jane Doe
they were going to cremate, so

1512
01:39:39,524 --> 01:39:41,289
I burned her in
my ex husband's car.

1513
01:39:41,319 --> 01:39:42,542
Ex husband?

1514
01:39:42,566 --> 01:39:44,589
Almost, ex.

1515
01:39:46,109 --> 01:39:49,789
Oh, you want me to tell you if it
bothers me that you got married?

1516
01:39:49,909 --> 01:39:53,349
I don't need you to tell me.

1517
01:39:54,389 --> 01:39:57,249
And you disappeared on me.
I don't owe you anything.

1518
01:39:57,269 --> 01:39:58,489
Hey, I didn't say you did.

1519
01:39:58,519 --> 01:40:01,949
Why don't you tell me what
happened to your beard?

1520
01:40:02,989 --> 01:40:04,289
Who was she?

1521
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:06,369
You were dead.
- Barely.

1522
01:40:06,389 --> 01:40:08,409
My body wasn't even cold.
- I was grieving.

1523
01:40:08,439 --> 01:40:12,189
Oh, you know what? Fuck it.

1524
01:40:12,829 --> 01:40:15,289
So that's it? You just breeze
in and breeze back out?

1525
01:40:15,319 --> 01:40:17,009
You ghosted me for three years.

1526
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:19,849
Then I drive up your stupid
mountain and your ice man.

1527
01:40:19,869 --> 01:40:22,617
Then you come out here one week in
L.A. and you've got some little...

1528
01:40:23,842 --> 01:40:28,349
You know what? Forget it, Waldo.
I don't know what I was thinking.

1529
01:40:35,573 --> 01:40:37,373
Fucking Lorena.

1530
01:40:48,097 --> 01:40:50,837
Jesus fucking Christ!

1531
01:40:50,861 --> 01:40:51,897
Fuck me!

1532
01:41:08,349 --> 01:41:11,309
Give you a ride somewhere?

1533
01:41:11,333 --> 01:41:12,565
In this?

1534
01:41:12,589 --> 01:41:15,247
What's it get? Four miles to the gallon?

1535
01:41:15,271 --> 01:41:18,709
It's a C300 and I dropped 55K on it,
and I fucking love it.

1536
01:41:18,739 --> 01:41:22,029
So what's it going to take to
get you to shut up about it?

1537
01:41:22,429 --> 01:41:24,479
Let me drive.

1538
01:41:24,503 --> 01:41:26,503
Jesus, Waldo.

1538
01:41:27,305 --> 01:42:27,266
