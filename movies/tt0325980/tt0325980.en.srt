2
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,100
Drink up, me hearties, yo ho

3
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,730
We kidnap and ravage
and don't give a hoot

4
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,681
Drink up, me hearties, yo ho

5
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:45,781
Yo ho, yo ho

6
00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:48,821
A pirate's life for me

7
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:54,781
We extort, we pilfer
We filch, we sack...

8
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:58,531
Quiet, missy!
Cursed pirates sail these waters.

9
00:00:58,831 --> 00:01:00,912
You don't want to bring
them down on us.

10
00:01:01,002 --> 00:01:02,912
Mr. Gibbs, that will do.

11
00:01:03,712 --> 00:01:05,712
She was singing about pirates!

12
00:01:05,802 --> 00:01:09,842
Bad luck to sing about pirates
with us mired in this unnatural fog.

13
00:01:09,932 --> 00:01:13,302
- Mark my words.
- Consider them marked.

14
00:01:14,182 --> 00:01:16,552
- On your way.
- Aye, Lieutenant.

15
00:01:16,642 --> 00:01:21,603
Bad luck to have a woman on board,
too. Even a miniature one.

16
00:01:22,153 --> 00:01:24,643
It'd be exciting to meet a pirate.

17
00:01:26,323 --> 00:01:31,273
Think again, Miss Swann.
Vile creatures, the lot of them.

18
00:01:31,363 --> 00:01:35,743
I intend to see to it that any man
who sails under a pirate flag

19
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:37,823
gets what he deserves.

20
00:01:38,413 --> 00:01:40,574
A short drop and a sudden stop.

21
00:01:44,634 --> 00:01:46,954
I appreciate your fervor,

22
00:01:47,044 --> 00:01:51,924
but I'm concerned about the effect this
subject will have upon my daughter.

23
00:01:52,014 --> 00:01:53,754
My apologies, Governor Swann.

24
00:01:53,844 --> 00:01:57,894
- Actually, I find it all fascinating.
- That's what concerns me.

25
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:28,706
There's a boy in the water!

26
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:32,996
Man overboard!

27
00:02:34,426 --> 00:02:38,296
Man the ropes! Fetch a hook!
Haul him aboard!

28
00:02:46,857 --> 00:02:48,767
He's still breathing.

29
00:02:48,857 --> 00:02:51,097
Mary, Mother of God!

30
00:02:57,487 --> 00:03:00,198
What happened here?

31
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:04,448
Most likely the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

32
00:03:06,918 --> 00:03:11,658
Lot of good it did them.
Everyone's thinking it, I'm saying it.

33
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,578
Pirates!

34
00:03:14,298 --> 00:03:17,718
There's no proof of that!
It was probably an accident.

35
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:24,089
Rouse the captain. Heave to
and take in sail. Launch the boats.

36
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,929
Elizabeth, accompany the boy.

37
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:33,139
He'll be in your charge.
Take care of him.

38
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,960
It's okay. My name's Elizabeth Swann.

39
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,751
Will Turner.

40
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:02,751
I'm watching over you, Will.

41
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,601
You're a pirate!

42
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,482
Has he said anything?

43
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:23,572
His name's William Turner.
That's all I found out.

44
00:04:23,662 --> 00:04:25,562
Take him below.

45
00:05:35,055 --> 00:05:36,765
Elizabeth!

46
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:40,636
Are you all right?

47
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:42,936
Are you decent?

48
00:05:43,026 --> 00:05:44,186
Yes.

49
00:05:44,446 --> 00:05:46,186
Yes?

50
00:05:46,616 --> 00:05:49,146
Still abed at this hour?

51
00:05:50,076 --> 00:05:52,026
It's a beautiful day.

52
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:56,076
I have a gift for you.

53
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:01,617
- It's beautiful!
- Isn't it?

54
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:05,457
May I inquire as to the occasion?

55
00:06:05,547 --> 00:06:09,377
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

56
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,877
Go on.

57
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:20,428
Actually... I had hoped you might
wear it for the ceremony today.

58
00:06:20,518 --> 00:06:21,768
The ceremony?

59
00:06:21,858 --> 00:06:24,528
Captain Norrington's
promotion ceremony.

60
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:25,808
I knew it!

61
00:06:25,898 --> 00:06:28,858
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

62
00:06:28,948 --> 00:06:33,158
A fine gentleman, don't you think?
He fancies you, you know.

63
00:06:34,198 --> 00:06:37,038
Elizabeth? How's it coming?

64
00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:41,819
- It's difficult to say.
- It's the latest fashion in London.

65
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:45,659
Women in London
must've learned not to breathe!

66
00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:48,829
My Lord, you have a visitor.

67
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,140
Mr. Turner! Good to see you again.

68
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,850
Good day, sir. I have your order.

69
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:25,741
The blade is folded steel. That's
gold filigree laid into the handle.

70
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:28,331
If I may?

71
00:07:29,921 --> 00:07:34,461
Perfectly balanced. The tang
is nearly the width of the blade.

72
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:39,542
Impressive. Very impressive.

73
00:07:41,352 --> 00:07:44,682
Commodore Norrington's
going to be very pleased with this.

74
00:07:45,392 --> 00:07:47,932
Do pass my compliments
onto your master.

75
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,762
I shall.

76
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:56,392
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

77
00:07:57,403 --> 00:08:00,853
Elizabeth!
You look absolutely stunning!

78
00:08:01,283 --> 00:08:04,863
Will! It's so good to see you!

79
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:09,113
- I had a dream about you last night.
- About me?

80
00:08:09,203 --> 00:08:13,153
- Elizabeth, is that proper...?
- About the day we met. Remember?

81
00:08:13,253 --> 00:08:15,333
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

82
00:08:15,423 --> 00:08:18,754
How many times must I ask you
to call me Elizabeth?

83
00:08:18,844 --> 00:08:22,094
At least once more, Miss Swann.
As always.

84
00:08:22,264 --> 00:08:25,924
There. See? At least the boy
has a sense of propriety.

85
00:08:26,014 --> 00:08:28,224
We really must be going.

86
00:08:29,604 --> 00:08:31,804
Good day, Mr. Turner.

87
00:08:32,434 --> 00:08:34,394
Come along!

88
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:38,485
Good day...

89
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:42,445
Elizabeth.

90
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:15,489
Hold up there, you!

91
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,910
It's a shilling to tie up
your boat to the dock.

92
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,370
I need to know your name.

93
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,880
What do you say to three shillings
and we forget the name?

94
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,091
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.

95
00:11:11,842 --> 00:11:13,632
Two paces... march!

96
00:11:16,183 --> 00:11:18,223
Right about... face!

97
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:23,473
Present... arms!

98
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:50,544
This dock is off limits to civilians.

99
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:55,094
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.
If I see one, I shall inform you.

100
00:11:58,765 --> 00:12:02,375
There's some high-toned
and fancy to-do at the fort.

101
00:12:02,475 --> 00:12:07,545
How could it be that two upstanding
gentlemen did not merit an invitation?

102
00:12:07,815 --> 00:12:11,555
We have to make sure this dock
stays off limits to civilians.

103
00:12:11,645 --> 00:12:17,606
It's a fine goal, to be sure,
but it seems to me, a ship like that

104
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:20,266
makes this one here
a bit superfluous.

105
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:23,446
The Dauntless is the power
in these waters,

106
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:27,446
but there's no ship that can match
the Interceptor for speed.

107
00:12:27,536 --> 00:12:31,366
I've heard of one. It's supposed
to be fast, nigh uncatchable.

108
00:12:31,956 --> 00:12:33,616
The Black Pearl.

109
00:12:35,757 --> 00:12:39,507
There's no real ship
that can match the Interceptor.

110
00:12:40,637 --> 00:12:42,677
The Black Pearl is a real ship.

111
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:45,767
- No, it's not.
- It is. I've seen it!

112
00:12:46,477 --> 00:12:48,677
- You've seen it?
- Yes.

113
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,847
- You haven't seen it!
- Yes, I have!

114
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:57,148
You've seen a ship with black sails,
that's crewed by the damned

115
00:12:57,238 --> 00:13:02,438
and captained by a man so evil
that Hell itself spat him back out?

116
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:05,898
- No.
- No.

117
00:13:05,988 --> 00:13:08,908
But I have seen a ship
with black sails.

118
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:11,398
No ship not crewed by the damned

119
00:13:11,498 --> 00:13:14,538
and captained by a man so evil,
Hell spat him back out,

120
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:18,999
could have black sails, so couldn't be
any other ship than The Black Pearl.

121
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,629
Is that what you're saying?

122
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:22,829
No.

123
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:27,499
Like I said, there's no real ship
that can match the Interceptor...

124
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:38,060
You! Get away from there!
You don't have permission to be aboard!

125
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,940
I'm sorry, but it's such a pretty
boat. Ship!

126
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,530
- What's your name?
- Smith! Or Smithy, if you like.

127
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,900
What's your purpose in Port Royal,
'Mr. Smith'?

128
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,570
- And no lies!
- All right. I confess.

129
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,791
I intend to commandeer a ship,
pick up a crew in Tortuga,

130
00:13:56,871 --> 00:13:59,741
rape, pillage and otherwise
pilfer my black guts out.

131
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:03,781
- I said no lies!
- I think he's telling the truth.

132
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:07,171
If he were telling the truth,
he wouldn't have told us.

133
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:11,261
Unless he knew you wouldn't believe
the truth even if he told you.

134
00:14:21,522 --> 00:14:23,352
May I have a moment?

135
00:14:32,322 --> 00:14:34,563
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

136
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:41,863
I apologize if I seem forward,
but I must speak my mind.

137
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:50,753
This promotion throws into sharp relief
that which I have not yet achieved.

138
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:55,514
A marriage to a fine woman.

139
00:14:56,514 --> 00:14:59,184
You have become a fine woman.

140
00:15:00,184 --> 00:15:01,814
I can't breathe!

141
00:15:01,894 --> 00:15:04,684
Yes, I'm a bit nervous myself.

142
00:15:07,564 --> 00:15:09,774
Then they made me their chief.

143
00:15:12,194 --> 00:15:13,854
Elizabeth?

144
00:15:16,035 --> 00:15:17,825
Elizabeth!

145
00:15:19,245 --> 00:15:22,335
The rocks!
Sir, it's a miracle she missed them!

146
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:27,295
- Will you be saving her?
- I can't swim!

147
00:15:28,965 --> 00:15:33,005
Pride of the King's Navy, you are!
Do not lose these.

148
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:49,056
What was that?

149
00:16:31,728 --> 00:16:33,558
I got her!

150
00:16:33,738 --> 00:16:36,519
- She's not breathing!
- Move!

151
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:47,159
- I never would've thought of that.
- You've never been to Singapore.

152
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:53,960
Where did you get that?

153
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,580
On your feet.

154
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,210
Elizabeth!

155
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,420
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

156
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,310
- Shoot him!
- Father!

157
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:15,311
Commodore, do you intend
to kill my rescuer?

158
00:17:21,491 --> 00:17:23,281
I believe thanks are in order.

159
00:17:27,911 --> 00:17:31,991
Had a brush with the East India
Trading Company, pirate?

160
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:34,662
Hang him!

161
00:17:34,752 --> 00:17:38,622
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

162
00:17:38,712 --> 00:17:41,912
Well, well. Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

163
00:17:42,722 --> 00:17:45,292
Captain Jack Sparrow,
if you please, sir.

164
00:17:45,382 --> 00:17:48,382
I don't see your ship... 'Captain'.

165
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:50,882
I'm in the market, as it were.

166
00:17:50,972 --> 00:17:53,262
He said he'd come to commandeer one.

167
00:17:53,353 --> 00:17:56,473
I told you he was telling the truth.
These are his.

168
00:17:59,363 --> 00:18:02,473
No additional shot nor powder.

169
00:18:04,073 --> 00:18:06,193
A compass that doesn't point north.

170
00:18:11,243 --> 00:18:14,494
I half expected it to be made from wood.

171
00:18:16,164 --> 00:18:19,994
You are without doubt
the worst pirate I've ever heard of!

172
00:18:20,084 --> 00:18:22,324
But you have heard of me.

173
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:26,504
Commodore, I must protest!

174
00:18:26,964 --> 00:18:28,674
Carefully, Lieutenant.

175
00:18:28,764 --> 00:18:30,964
Pirate or not, this man saved my life!

176
00:18:31,054 --> 00:18:34,965
One good deed is not enough to redeem
a man for his wickedness!

177
00:18:35,055 --> 00:18:37,815
- It seems enough to condemn him.
- Indeed.

178
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:40,765
Finally.

179
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:45,315
- Don't shoot!
- I knew you'd warm up to me.

180
00:18:45,405 --> 00:18:49,525
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please. And my hat.

181
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,525
Commodore.

182
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:57,456
- Elizabeth... it is Elizabeth?
- It's Miss Swann.

183
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:02,786
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.
Come, dear, we don't have all day.

184
00:19:04,216 --> 00:19:06,206
If you'll be very kind.

185
00:19:22,647 --> 00:19:24,937
Easy on the goods, darling.

186
00:19:25,437 --> 00:19:28,857
- You're despicable.
- Sticks and stones, love.

187
00:19:29,027 --> 00:19:31,697
I saved your life, you saved mine.
We're square.

188
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,448
Gentlemen, my lady,

189
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:38,868
you will always remember this
as the day you almost caught...

190
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,408
Captain Jack Sparrow!

191
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:03,219
- Now will you shoot him?
- Open fire!

192
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:12,560
On his heels!

193
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,960
Take cover, man!

194
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,791
Gillette, Mr.. Sparrow has
a dawn appointment with the gallows.

195
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:37,091
I would hate for him to miss it.

196
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:42,751
Search up the stairs!

197
00:20:43,511 --> 00:20:45,511
Look lively, men!

198
00:22:18,146 --> 00:22:19,856
Right where I left you.

199
00:22:26,866 --> 00:22:29,486
Not where I left you.

200
00:22:38,837 --> 00:22:41,037
You're the one they're hunting.

201
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:43,467
The pirate!

202
00:22:43,547 --> 00:22:46,667
You seem familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

203
00:22:46,757 --> 00:22:49,547
I avoid familiarity with pirates.

204
00:22:50,717 --> 00:22:55,138
It would be a shame to put a black
mark on your record. Excuse me.

205
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:03,558
Do you think this wise, boy?
Crossing blades with a pirate?

206
00:23:04,698 --> 00:23:07,148
You threatened Miss Swann.

207
00:23:09,238 --> 00:23:11,108
Only a little.

208
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:29,969
You know what you're doing.
Excellent form. How's your footwork?

209
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:32,170
If I step here...

210
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,880
Good.

211
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,050
And now I step again.

212
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,900
Ta.

213
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:05,241
That is a wonderful trick.

214
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:09,581
Except, once again,
you are between me and my way out.

215
00:24:09,671 --> 00:24:12,712
And now...
you have no weapon.

216
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,693
Who makes all these?

217
00:24:38,203 --> 00:24:39,483
I do.

218
00:24:39,953 --> 00:24:43,453
And I practice with them
three hours a day.

219
00:24:45,373 --> 00:24:47,453
You need to find yourself a girl, mate.

220
00:24:54,214 --> 00:24:59,044
Or, the reason you practice three hours
a day is that you already found one

221
00:24:59,134 --> 00:25:02,754
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

222
00:25:02,844 --> 00:25:05,344
You're not a eunuch, are you?

223
00:25:05,434 --> 00:25:09,814
I practice three hours a day
so when I meet a pirate, I can kill him!

224
00:26:27,058 --> 00:26:29,338
- You cheated!
- Pirate.

225
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:34,929
- Move away!
- No.

226
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:36,399
Please?

227
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:40,269
No! I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

228
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:44,849
This shot is not meant for you.

229
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,200
There he is! Over here!

230
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:05,130
Excellent work, Mr. Brown. You've
assisted in the capture of a fugitive.

231
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,500
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

232
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,551
I trust you will remember this as the
day Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.

233
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:16,181
Take him away.

234
00:27:22,191 --> 00:27:26,731
- Come here, boy. Come here.
- Who wants a juicy bone?

235
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:29,111
Come here, boy!

236
00:27:29,902 --> 00:27:34,122
You can keep doing that forever.
The dog is never going to move.

237
00:27:34,202 --> 00:27:38,332
Excuse us if we haven't resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet.

238
00:27:45,212 --> 00:27:49,422
There you go, miss. It was
a difficult day for you, I'm sure.

239
00:27:49,512 --> 00:27:54,673
I suspected Commodore Norrington would
propose, but I wasn't prepared for it.

240
00:27:54,763 --> 00:27:58,923
I meant you being threatened
by that pirate! Sounds terrifying!

241
00:28:00,473 --> 00:28:02,303
Yes, it was terrifying.

242
00:28:02,393 --> 00:28:05,593
But... the Commodore proposed!
Fancy that.

243
00:28:05,693 --> 00:28:09,473
That's a smart match, miss,
if it's not too bold to say.

244
00:28:09,574 --> 00:28:10,984
It is a smart match.

245
00:28:12,114 --> 00:28:13,904
He's a fine man.

246
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:18,654
He's what any woman
should dream of marrying.

247
00:28:18,824 --> 00:28:23,124
That Will Turner...
he's a fine man, too.

248
00:28:23,204 --> 00:28:24,994
That is too bold.

249
00:28:25,084 --> 00:28:28,864
Beggin' your pardon.
It was not my place.

250
00:29:17,717 --> 00:29:20,717
Has my daughter
given you an answer yet?

251
00:29:20,807 --> 00:29:22,427
No, she hasn't.

252
00:29:22,517 --> 00:29:24,837
She has had a trying day.

253
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:30,648
- Ghastly weather, don't you think?
- Really bleak.

254
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,098
What's that?

255
00:29:34,528 --> 00:29:36,398
Cannon fire!

256
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:39,648
Return fire!

257
00:29:40,198 --> 00:29:42,068
I know those guns.

258
00:29:47,748 --> 00:29:49,789
It's the Pearl.

259
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:51,869
The Black Pearl?

260
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:55,629
I've heard stories.

261
00:29:55,709 --> 00:29:59,709
She's been preying on ships
and settlements for ten years.

262
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:02,879
- Never leaves any survivors.
- No survivors?

263
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,759
Then where do the stories
come from, I wonder?

264
00:30:30,501 --> 00:30:31,951
Mama!

265
00:31:38,724 --> 00:31:41,304
- Sight the muzzle flash.
- Aim for the flashes!

266
00:31:41,394 --> 00:31:45,774
I need a full spread, fore and aft.
Mr. Stevens, more cartridges.

267
00:31:46,064 --> 00:31:49,985
Governor. Barricade yourself
in my office.

268
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:53,445
That's an order.

269
00:32:11,176 --> 00:32:12,556
Don't!

270
00:32:12,966 --> 00:32:15,006
Hello, chum.

271
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:19,926
Up there!

272
00:32:29,737 --> 00:32:32,407
Miss Swann,
they've come to kidnap you.

273
00:32:32,487 --> 00:32:35,107
- What?
- You're the governor's daughter!

274
00:32:35,197 --> 00:32:37,107
In here!

275
00:32:38,037 --> 00:32:42,197
They haven't seen you.
First chance you get, run to the fort.

276
00:32:51,128 --> 00:32:52,838
Gotcha!

277
00:32:58,848 --> 00:33:01,338
No! It's hot. I'm burning!

278
00:33:01,428 --> 00:33:02,508
Come on!

279
00:33:06,938 --> 00:33:09,149
Come on, me men.

280
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:49,591
We know you're here, poppet.

281
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:53,351
- Poppet!
- Come out.

282
00:33:53,571 --> 00:33:56,021
We promise we won't hurt you.

283
00:33:58,191 --> 00:34:00,771
We will find you, poppet.

284
00:34:01,321 --> 00:34:05,571
You've got something of ours
and it calls to us.

285
00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:13,752
The gold calls to us.

286
00:34:14,832 --> 00:34:17,212
The gold.

287
00:34:22,132 --> 00:34:24,212
Hello, poppet.

288
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,972
Parley.

289
00:34:27,052 --> 00:34:30,423
- What?
- I invoke the right of parley.

290
00:34:30,523 --> 00:34:35,893
The Code of the Brethren states
you have to take me to your captain.

291
00:34:35,983 --> 00:34:37,643
I know the Code.

292
00:34:37,733 --> 00:34:41,603
You can do me no harm
until the parley is complete.

293
00:34:41,693 --> 00:34:46,323
- To blazes with the Code.
- She wants to be taken to the Captain.

294
00:34:46,783 --> 00:34:49,074
And she'll go, without a fuss.

295
00:34:50,164 --> 00:34:53,194
We must honor the Code.

296
00:35:03,924 --> 00:35:05,834
Say goodbye!

297
00:35:09,765 --> 00:35:11,175
Goodbye.

298
00:35:15,435 --> 00:35:17,925
- Come on.
- Elizabeth.

299
00:35:26,615 --> 00:35:28,736
Out of my way, scum!

300
00:35:40,836 --> 00:35:43,756
My sympathies. You've no manner
of luck at all.

301
00:36:06,277 --> 00:36:09,448
Come on, doggy! It's just
you and me now.

302
00:36:09,528 --> 00:36:15,898
It's you and old Jack. Come on.
That's a boy! Get your bone!

303
00:36:15,998 --> 00:36:19,578
That's a good boy.
A bit closer!

304
00:36:19,918 --> 00:36:21,988
That's it, doggy!

305
00:36:22,088 --> 00:36:25,418
Come on, you filthy,
slimy, mangy character!

306
00:36:27,339 --> 00:36:30,129
No! I didn't mean it!

307
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:39,219
This ain't the armory!

308
00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:46,560
Well, well, well. Look what we have
here, Twigg. Captain Jack Sparrow!

309
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,890
Last time I saw you,

310
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:56,600
you were all alone on a godforsaken
island, shrinking into the distance.

311
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,450
His fortunes aren't improved much.

312
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,950
Worry about your own fortunes,
gentlemen.

313
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,701
The deepest circle of Hell is reserved
for betrayers and mutineers.

314
00:37:11,841 --> 00:37:14,001
So there is a curse.

315
00:37:15,511 --> 00:37:19,381
- That's interesting.
- You know nothing of Hell.

316
00:37:27,602 --> 00:37:29,602
That's very interesting.

317
00:38:04,803 --> 00:38:07,344
I didn't know we was takin' on captives.

318
00:38:07,434 --> 00:38:10,724
She's invoked the right of parley
with Captain Barbossa.

319
00:38:10,814 --> 00:38:14,434
- I am here to...
- You will speak when spoken to.

320
00:38:15,444 --> 00:38:20,484
And ye will not lay a hand on those
under the protection of parley.

321
00:38:20,574 --> 00:38:22,484
Aye, sir.

322
00:38:24,494 --> 00:38:27,415
My apologies, miss.

323
00:38:27,495 --> 00:38:33,285
Captain Barbossa... I am here to
negotiate the cessation of hostilities.

324
00:38:34,085 --> 00:38:38,745
There are a lot of long words there.
We're naught but humble pirates.

325
00:38:39,505 --> 00:38:43,675
- What is it you want?
- Leave and never come back.

326
00:38:45,886 --> 00:38:49,836
I'm disinclined to acquiesce
to your request.

327
00:38:50,056 --> 00:38:52,436
Means "no."

328
00:38:53,816 --> 00:38:56,106
Very well.

329
00:38:57,526 --> 00:38:59,516
I'll drop it.

330
00:39:03,526 --> 00:39:08,237
Me holds are burstin' with swag.
That bit of shine matters to us?

331
00:39:08,577 --> 00:39:10,367
Why?

332
00:39:10,457 --> 00:39:14,367
It's what you've been searching for.
I recognize the ship.

333
00:39:14,457 --> 00:39:17,377
I saw it eight years ago
on the crossing from England!

334
00:39:17,457 --> 00:39:19,537
Did you now?

335
00:39:21,627 --> 00:39:27,338
Fine. I suppose if it is worthless
there's no point in me keeping it.

336
00:39:27,428 --> 00:39:29,138
No!

337
00:39:39,398 --> 00:39:41,478
You have a name, missy?

338
00:39:42,608 --> 00:39:48,279
Elizabeth... Turner. I'm a maid
in the Governor's household.

339
00:39:51,579 --> 00:39:53,569
Miss Turner!

340
00:39:54,249 --> 00:39:56,919
- Turner!
- Bootstrap!

341
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:06,170
How does a maid come to own
that trinket? Family heirloom?

342
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,130
I didn't steal it,
if that's what you mean.

343
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:14,630
You hand it over
and we'll leave and never return.

344
00:40:28,611 --> 00:40:30,601
Our bargain?

345
00:40:32,621 --> 00:40:37,611
Still the guns and stow them. Signal
the men and make good to clear port.

346
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:40,541
You have to take me to shore.
According to the Code...

347
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:42,281
First...

348
00:40:42,371 --> 00:40:46,542
Your return to shore was not part of
our negotiations so I must do nothing.

349
00:40:46,632 --> 00:40:50,792
Secondly, you must be a pirate for the
Pirate's Code to apply, and you're not.

350
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:56,222
Thirdly, the code is more what
you'd call guidelines than actual rules.

351
00:40:56,302 --> 00:40:59,842
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,
Miss Turner.

352
00:41:20,623 --> 00:41:23,023
They've taken Elizabeth!

353
00:41:23,123 --> 00:41:25,954
Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.

354
00:41:26,334 --> 00:41:29,044
We have to hunt them down.
We must save her.

355
00:41:29,134 --> 00:41:31,664
Where do you propose we start?

356
00:41:31,754 --> 00:41:36,304
If you have any information
concerning my daughter, share it.

357
00:41:37,724 --> 00:41:41,634
That Jack Sparrow.
He talked about the Black Pearl.

358
00:41:41,894 --> 00:41:44,725
Mentioned it is more what he did.

359
00:41:45,475 --> 00:41:48,265
Ask him where it is!
He could lead us to it.

360
00:41:48,565 --> 00:41:50,055
No.

361
00:41:50,145 --> 00:41:56,065
The pirates left Sparrow in his cell,
ergo they are not his allies.

362
00:41:56,575 --> 00:41:59,525
We will establish their
most likely course...

363
00:41:59,615 --> 00:42:01,985
That's not good enough!

364
00:42:02,075 --> 00:42:09,286
Mr. Turner, you are not a military man
or a sailor. You are a blacksmith.

365
00:42:09,666 --> 00:42:13,336
And this is not the moment
for rash actions!

366
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:20,336
Do not think you are the only man here
who cares for Elizabeth.

367
00:42:25,017 --> 00:42:26,597
Please.

368
00:42:31,227 --> 00:42:33,517
- You! Sparrow!
- Aye?

369
00:42:33,857 --> 00:42:36,527
You are familiar with
the Black Pearl?

370
00:42:36,607 --> 00:42:39,067
- I've heard of it.
- Where does it make berth?

371
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:43,317
Where does it make berth?
Have you not heard the stories?

372
00:42:45,078 --> 00:42:51,448
Captain Barbossa and his crew of
miscreants sail from the Isla de Muerta.

373
00:42:51,538 --> 00:42:57,548
It's an island that cannot be found,
except by those who know where it is.

374
00:42:57,628 --> 00:43:02,838
The ship's real, therefore its anchorage
must be a real place. Where?

375
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:07,129
- Why ask me?
- Because you're a pirate.

376
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:10,879
You want to turn pirate yourself.
Is that it?

377
00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:13,349
Never!

378
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:19,479
- They took Miss Swann.
- So it is that you found a girl!

379
00:43:19,689 --> 00:43:21,439
I see!

380
00:43:21,529 --> 00:43:24,650
If you intend to brave all,
hasten to her rescue,

381
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:29,070
and so, win fair lady's heart,
you'll have to do it alone, mate.

382
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,160
I see no profit in it for me.

383
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:35,080
- I can get you out of here.
- The key's run off.

384
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:39,750
I helped build these cells.
These are half-pin barrel hinges.

385
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:46,711
With leverage and the proper application
of strength, the door will lift free.

386
00:43:49,351 --> 00:43:52,511
- What's your name?
- Will Turner.

387
00:43:53,851 --> 00:43:57,381
That would be short for William,
I imagine. Good, strong name.

388
00:43:58,401 --> 00:44:01,401
No doubt named for your father.

389
00:44:02,191 --> 00:44:04,152
Yes.

390
00:44:06,032 --> 00:44:09,192
Mr. Turner, I've changed me mind.

391
00:44:09,282 --> 00:44:12,282
If you spring me from here,
I swear, on pain of death,

392
00:44:12,372 --> 00:44:16,282
I shall take you to the Black Pearl,
and your bonny lass.

393
00:44:16,372 --> 00:44:18,942
Do we have an accord?

394
00:44:21,882 --> 00:44:24,913
- Agreed.
- Agreed! Get me out!

395
00:44:28,423 --> 00:44:31,963
- Hurry! Someone will have heard that.
- Not without my effects.

396
00:44:38,523 --> 00:44:40,673
We're going to steal a ship?

397
00:44:41,983 --> 00:44:44,684
- That ship?
- Commandeer.

398
00:44:44,774 --> 00:44:48,224
We're going to "commandeer" that ship.
Nautical term.

399
00:44:49,234 --> 00:44:52,824
One question about your business,
or there's no use going.

400
00:44:52,904 --> 00:44:56,774
This girl, how far are you willing to go
to save her?

401
00:44:56,874 --> 00:45:01,614
- I'd die for her.
- Good. No worries then.

402
00:45:20,645 --> 00:45:23,135
This is either madness or brilliance.

403
00:45:23,976 --> 00:45:27,596
It's remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

404
00:45:57,307 --> 00:46:01,137
Everyone stay calm!
We're taking over the ship.

405
00:46:01,227 --> 00:46:03,268
Aye! Avast!

406
00:46:06,188 --> 00:46:11,148
This ship cannot be crewed by two men.
You'll never make it out of the bay.

407
00:46:12,188 --> 00:46:16,268
Son... I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

408
00:46:16,818 --> 00:46:18,368
Savvy?

409
00:46:21,868 --> 00:46:25,159
- Commodore!
- They're taking the Dauntless!

410
00:46:27,209 --> 00:46:30,709
Commodore! They've taken the ship!

411
00:46:30,799 --> 00:46:34,079
Sparrow and Turner!
They're taking the Dauntless!

412
00:46:34,169 --> 00:46:37,209
Rash, Turner. Too rash.

413
00:46:38,799 --> 00:46:43,010
That is, without doubt, the worst pirate
I have ever seen.

414
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:48,520
Here they come.

415
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,690
Bring her around!

416
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,231
Search every cabin, every hold,
down to the bilges.

417
00:47:20,511 --> 00:47:23,132
Sailors, back to the Interceptor!

418
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:33,092
Thank you, Commodore,
for getting us ready to make way.

419
00:47:33,192 --> 00:47:35,812
We'd have had
a hard time by ourselves.

420
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,352
Set topsails and clear up this mess.

421
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:43,813
With this wind we won't catch them.

422
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:47,073
I don't need to. Get them in range
of the long nines.

423
00:47:47,163 --> 00:47:50,283
Run out the guns!

424
00:47:50,373 --> 00:47:52,943
We are to fire on our own ship, sir?

425
00:47:53,043 --> 00:47:58,033
I'd rather see her at the bottom of the
ocean than in the hands of a pirate.

426
00:47:58,213 --> 00:48:01,623
Commodore!
He's disabled the rudder chain.

427
00:48:05,304 --> 00:48:07,344
Abandon ship!

428
00:48:13,684 --> 00:48:17,014
That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.

429
00:48:17,354 --> 00:48:19,814
So it would seem.

430
00:48:28,535 --> 00:48:32,365
When I was a lad living in England,
my mother raised me by herself.

431
00:48:32,455 --> 00:48:36,365
After she died, I came here,
looking for my father.

432
00:48:37,835 --> 00:48:39,875
Is that so?

433
00:48:40,665 --> 00:48:43,756
My father, Bill Turner?

434
00:48:43,836 --> 00:48:46,836
It was only after you learned my name
you agreed to help.

435
00:48:46,926 --> 00:48:49,716
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

436
00:48:49,806 --> 00:48:53,306
I'm not a simpleton.
You knew my father.

437
00:48:59,476 --> 00:49:03,887
I knew him. Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.

438
00:49:03,987 --> 00:49:07,107
Everyone else just called him
"Bootstrap".

439
00:49:07,197 --> 00:49:09,107
Bootstrap?

440
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:13,657
Good man. Good pirate.
I swear, you look just like him.

441
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:18,947
It's not true. He was a merchant sailor.
A respectable man who obeyed the law.

442
00:49:19,167 --> 00:49:22,248
He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.

443
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:25,458
My father was not a pirate!

444
00:49:26,628 --> 00:49:30,458
Put it away, son.
It's not worth you getting beat again.

445
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:35,048
You ignored the rules of engagement.
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

446
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:38,138
That's not much incentive
for me to fight fair, is it?

447
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:48,679
As long as you're just
hanging there, pay attention.

448
00:49:48,779 --> 00:49:51,559
The only rules that matter are these:

449
00:49:51,649 --> 00:49:55,109
What a man can do
and what a man can't do.

450
00:49:55,829 --> 00:50:01,329
You can accept your father was a
pirate and a good man, or you can't.

451
00:50:01,409 --> 00:50:05,740
Pirate is in your blood, so you'll
have to square with that someday.

452
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:08,370
Me, for example,
I can let you drown,

453
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:12,960
but I can't bring this ship into Tortuga
all by me onesies, savvy?

454
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:14,830
So.

455
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:22,221
Can you sail under the command
of a pirate?

456
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:25,511
Or can you not?

457
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:29,271
Tortuga?

458
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,811
Tortuga.

459
00:50:54,002 --> 00:50:56,672
It is a sad life
that has never breathed deep

460
00:50:56,762 --> 00:51:00,212
the sweet, proliferous bouquet
that is Tortuga. Savvy?

461
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:03,803
What do you think?

462
00:51:07,353 --> 00:51:10,053
- It'll linger.
- I'll tell you, mate,

463
00:51:10,273 --> 00:51:16,023
if every town were like this one,
no man would ever feel unwanted.

464
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:18,983
Scarlett!

465
00:51:20,073 --> 00:51:22,234
Not sure I deserved that.

466
00:51:23,154 --> 00:51:24,499
Giselle.

467
00:51:24,534 --> 00:51:26,244
- Who was she?
- What?

468
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:29,904
I may have deserved that.

469
00:51:32,334 --> 00:51:35,334
Curse you for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot!

470
00:51:37,924 --> 00:51:39,914
Mother's love!

471
00:51:40,004 --> 00:51:41,715
Jack!

472
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:45,125
You should know not to wake a man
when he's sleepin'.

473
00:51:45,225 --> 00:51:49,085
- It's bad luck.
- Fortunately, I know how to counter it.

474
00:51:49,185 --> 00:51:52,345
The man who did the waking
buys the man who was sleeping a drink.

475
00:51:52,685 --> 00:51:57,565
The man who was sleeping drinks it
while listening to his proposition.

476
00:51:59,855 --> 00:52:02,696
Aye, that'll about do it.

477
00:52:06,746 --> 00:52:08,696
Blast! I'm already awake!

478
00:52:09,036 --> 00:52:11,196
That was for the smell.

479
00:52:20,927 --> 00:52:22,917
Keep a sharp eye.

480
00:52:30,017 --> 00:52:33,387
Now, what's the nature
of this venture of your'n?

481
00:52:34,647 --> 00:52:36,797
I'm going after the Black Pearl.

482
00:52:40,567 --> 00:52:43,898
I know where it's going to be,
and I'm gonna take it.

483
00:52:45,318 --> 00:52:48,318
Jack, it's a fool's errand.

484
00:52:48,408 --> 00:52:51,688
You know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl.

485
00:52:51,788 --> 00:52:54,818
That's why I know
what Barbossa is up to.

486
00:52:54,918 --> 00:52:57,158
All I need is a crew.

487
00:52:57,248 --> 00:53:02,129
Captain Barbossa is not a man to suffer
fools nor strike a bargain with one.

488
00:53:02,209 --> 00:53:04,449
It's a good thing I'm not a fool, then.

489
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:09,589
Prove me wrong. What makes you think
Barbossa will give up his ship to you?

490
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:13,009
Let's just say it's a matter
of leverage.

491
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,270
The kid?

492
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:34,870
That is the child
of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

493
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:38,410
His only child. Savvy?

494
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:41,071
Is he now?

495
00:53:43,381 --> 00:53:45,751
Leverage, says you.

496
00:53:45,841 --> 00:53:48,871
I feel a change in the wind, says I.

497
00:53:48,961 --> 00:53:53,181
I'll find us a crew. There's bound to be
some sailors on this rock crazy as you.

498
00:53:53,341 --> 00:53:55,631
One can only hope.

499
00:53:55,721 --> 00:53:58,511
- Take what you can!
- Give nothin' back!

500
00:54:23,253 --> 00:54:27,493
You'll be dining with the captain,
and he requests you wear this.

501
00:54:28,503 --> 00:54:32,033
Tell him that I am disinclined
to acquiesce to his request.

502
00:54:33,173 --> 00:54:35,413
He said you'd say that.

503
00:54:35,513 --> 00:54:39,974
He also said if that be the case,
you'll be dining with the crew.

504
00:54:40,054 --> 00:54:43,054
And you'll be naked.

505
00:54:48,064 --> 00:54:49,174
Fine.

506
00:55:05,915 --> 00:55:09,495
There's no need to stand on ceremony,
no call to impress anyone.

507
00:55:10,545 --> 00:55:13,035
You must be hungry.

508
00:55:29,356 --> 00:55:31,346
Try the wine.

509
00:55:35,446 --> 00:55:38,446
And the apples. One of those next.

510
00:55:46,707 --> 00:55:49,237
It's poisoned.

511
00:55:49,917 --> 00:55:52,117
There would be no sense
to be killing you.

512
00:55:52,337 --> 00:55:56,327
Then release me. You have your trinket.
I'm of no further value to you.

513
00:55:59,798 --> 00:56:03,378
You don't know what this is, do you?

514
00:56:03,468 --> 00:56:05,458
It's a pirate medallion.

515
00:56:05,718 --> 00:56:08,638
This is Aztec gold.

516
00:56:08,728 --> 00:56:14,728
One of 882 identical pieces they
delivered in a stone chest to Cortיs.

517
00:56:16,228 --> 00:56:21,019
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

518
00:56:21,109 --> 00:56:24,149
But the greed of Cortיs was insatiable.

519
00:56:24,449 --> 00:56:27,899
So the heathen gods
placed upon the gold...

520
00:56:29,789 --> 00:56:32,329
a terrible curse.

521
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:38,249
Any mortal that removes but
a single piece from that stone chest...

522
00:56:38,339 --> 00:56:40,024
shall be punished for eternity.

523
00:56:40,059 --> 00:56:41,710
Shall be punished for eternity.

524
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:46,540
I hardly believe in ghost stories
any more, Captain Barbossa.

525
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,750
Aye.

526
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,090
That's exactly what I thought
when we were first told the tale.

527
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:55,180
Buried on an island of the dead
what cannot be found,

528
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:57,890
except for those who know where it is.

529
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:00,731
Find it, we did.

530
00:57:01,771 --> 00:57:05,851
There be the chest.
Inside be the gold.

531
00:57:05,951 --> 00:57:08,071
And we took 'em all!

532
00:57:08,451 --> 00:57:10,441
We spent 'em and traded 'em,

533
00:57:10,531 --> 00:57:14,661
and frittered 'em away on drink and food
and pleasurable company.

534
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:20,242
The more we gave 'em away,
the more we came to realize...

535
00:57:21,082 --> 00:57:24,422
the drink would not satisfy.

536
00:57:24,502 --> 00:57:28,172
Food turned to ash in our mouths,

537
00:57:28,262 --> 00:57:32,922
and all the pleasurable company
in the world could not slake our lust.

538
00:57:34,512 --> 00:57:37,852
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

539
00:57:39,023 --> 00:57:42,223
Compelled by greed we were, but now...

540
00:57:42,313 --> 00:57:44,773
we are consumed by it.

541
00:57:55,953 --> 00:58:00,244
There is one way we can end our curse.

542
00:58:03,044 --> 00:58:07,674
All the scattered pieces
of the Aztec gold must be restored,

543
00:58:07,754 --> 00:58:09,744
and the blood repaid.

544
00:58:12,714 --> 00:58:16,334
Thanks to ye, we have the final piece.

545
00:58:18,344 --> 00:58:20,555
And the blood to be repaid?

546
00:58:20,725 --> 00:58:24,225
That's why there's no sense
to be killing you.

547
00:58:24,315 --> 00:58:26,275
Yet.

548
00:58:27,105 --> 00:58:29,595
Apple?

549
00:58:45,456 --> 00:58:49,456
I'm curious. After killing me,
what are you planning on doing next?

550
00:59:53,899 --> 00:59:55,139
Look!

551
00:59:55,229 --> 00:59:58,400
The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

552
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,410
We are not among the living
and so we cannot die.

553
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:04,320
But neither are we dead.

554
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:09,240
For too long I've been parched of thirst
and unable to quench it.

555
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:14,330
Too long I've been starvin' to death
and haven't died.

556
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,540
I feel nothing.

557
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:19,551
Not the wind on my face,
nor the spray of the sea...

558
01:00:20,971 --> 01:00:23,461
nor the warmth of a woman's flesh.

559
01:00:24,181 --> 01:00:28,641
You best start believing
in ghost stories, Miss Turner.

560
01:00:28,721 --> 01:00:30,631
You're in one!

561
01:00:48,532 --> 01:00:50,912
What are you looking at?
Back to work!

562
01:00:50,992 --> 01:00:54,032
You heard the captain.
Back to work.

563
01:00:59,753 --> 01:01:04,463
Feast your eyes, Captain. All of them,
faithful hands before the mast.

564
01:01:04,553 --> 01:01:07,633
Every man worth his salt,

565
01:01:07,843 --> 01:01:09,723
and crazy to boot.

566
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:12,803
So this is your able-bodied crew?

567
01:01:19,104 --> 01:01:21,064
- You, sailor!
- Cotton, sir.

568
01:01:21,154 --> 01:01:24,654
Mr. Cotton, do you have the courage
and fortitude to follow orders

569
01:01:24,734 --> 01:01:27,774
and stay true in the face of danger
and almost certain death?

570
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:32,364
- Mr. Cotton. Answer, man!
- He's a mute, sir.

571
01:01:32,454 --> 01:01:36,694
Poor devil had his tongue cut out, so
he trained the parrot to talk for him.

572
01:01:36,794 --> 01:01:38,825
No one's yet figured how.

573
01:01:41,505 --> 01:01:45,455
Mr. Cotton's parrot,
same question.

574
01:01:45,675 --> 01:01:49,045
Wind in your sails!
Wind in your sails!

575
01:01:49,555 --> 01:01:51,955
Mostly, we figure that means "yes".

576
01:01:52,055 --> 01:01:54,295
Of course it does. Satisfied?

577
01:01:55,265 --> 01:01:57,255
Well, you've proved they're mad.

578
01:01:57,356 --> 01:01:59,726
What's the benefit for us?

579
01:02:09,776 --> 01:02:10,856
Anamaria!

580
01:02:13,326 --> 01:02:17,196
- I suppose you didn't deserve that.
- No, that one I deserved.

581
01:02:17,287 --> 01:02:20,157
- You stole my boat!
- Actually...

582
01:02:22,247 --> 01:02:27,327
Borrowed without permission, but with
every intention of bringing it back.

583
01:02:27,417 --> 01:02:30,207
- But you didn't!
- You'll get another one.

584
01:02:31,967 --> 01:02:33,957
- I will.
- A better one.

585
01:02:34,057 --> 01:02:35,877
A better one!

586
01:02:35,967 --> 01:02:38,258
- That one.
- What one?

587
01:02:40,098 --> 01:02:41,758
That one?

588
01:02:44,818 --> 01:02:46,518
Aye. That one.

589
01:02:46,608 --> 01:02:48,148
- What say you?
- Aye!

590
01:02:48,238 --> 01:02:49,608
Aye!

591
01:02:49,698 --> 01:02:51,688
Anchor's aweigh!

592
01:02:51,778 --> 01:02:55,908
No, it's frightful bad luck
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

593
01:02:55,988 --> 01:02:58,279
It'll be far worse not to have her.

594
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:35,480
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find,

595
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:37,781
with a compass that doesn't work?

596
01:03:37,861 --> 01:03:42,611
The compass doesn't point north, but
we're not trying to find north, are we?

597
01:03:53,291 --> 01:03:55,701
We should drop canvas, sir.

598
01:03:55,801 --> 01:03:57,842
She can hold a bit longer.

599
01:04:00,092 --> 01:04:03,682
What's in your head as puts you
in such a fine mood, Cap'n?

600
01:04:03,762 --> 01:04:05,422
We're catching up.

601
01:04:20,493 --> 01:04:22,533
Time to go, poppet.

602
01:05:18,166 --> 01:05:22,586
Dead men tell no tales.

603
01:05:25,136 --> 01:05:29,716
Chills the bones, how many honest
sailors been claimed by this passage.

604
01:05:45,157 --> 01:05:47,527
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

605
01:05:47,617 --> 01:05:50,697
Not a lot's known about Jack Sparrow
before he came to Tortuga

606
01:05:50,787 --> 01:05:53,447
with a mind to find the treasure
of the Isla de Muerta.

607
01:05:53,657 --> 01:05:56,998
That was before I'd met him, when he
was captain of the Black Pearl.

608
01:05:57,878 --> 01:05:58,908
What?

609
01:06:02,798 --> 01:06:06,578
- He failed to mention that.
- He plays things close to the vest now.

610
01:06:06,678 --> 01:06:08,878
And a hard-learned lesson it was.

611
01:06:08,968 --> 01:06:13,458
Three days into the trip, the first mate
says, "Everything's an equal share."

612
01:06:13,558 --> 01:06:18,299
"The location of the treasure, too."
So Jack gives up the bearings.

613
01:06:18,389 --> 01:06:21,679
That night, there was a mutiny.

614
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:24,859
They marooned Jack on an island
and left him to die.

615
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:28,279
But not before he'd
gone mad with the heat.

616
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:33,439
So that's the reason for all the...

617
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:38,280
Reason's got nothing to do with it.

618
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:43,830
When a pirate's marooned, he's given
a pistol with a single shot. One shot.

619
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,790
That won't do much good hunting,
nor to be rescued.

620
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,540
But after three weeks
of a starving belly and thirst,

621
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:53,630
that pistol looks real friendly.

622
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:57,001
But Jack escaped the island,
and still has that single shot.

623
01:06:57,101 --> 01:07:00,631
He won't use it, though,
save on one man.

624
01:07:00,721 --> 01:07:02,761
His mutinous first mate.

625
01:07:02,851 --> 01:07:04,841
- Barbossa.
- Aye.

626
01:07:06,101 --> 01:07:09,441
- How did Jack get off the island?
- I'll tell ye.

627
01:07:09,521 --> 01:07:13,851
He waded out into the shallows,
and waited three days and three nights,

628
01:07:13,941 --> 01:07:18,692
till all manner of sea creatures
became acclimated to his presence.

629
01:07:18,782 --> 01:07:22,612
On the fourth morning,
he roped a couple of sea turtles,

630
01:07:22,702 --> 01:07:25,072
lashed them together
and made a raft.

631
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:30,572
- He roped a couple of sea turtles.
- Aye.

632
01:07:32,842 --> 01:07:35,162
What did he use for rope?

633
01:07:40,433 --> 01:07:42,673
Human hair.

634
01:07:42,763 --> 01:07:45,253
From my back.

635
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:48,803
- Let go the anchor!
- Lower the anchor line!

636
01:07:48,893 --> 01:07:51,273
Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore.

637
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:53,053
Captain.

638
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:55,694
What if the worst should happen?

639
01:07:55,774 --> 01:07:59,064
- Keep to the Code.
- Aye. The Code.

640
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:29,975
- Ten years of hoarding swag.
- Now we finally get to spend it.

641
01:08:37,106 --> 01:08:39,896
Once we're quit of the curse,
we'll be rich men...

642
01:08:40,656 --> 01:08:44,316
and you can buy an eye
that fits and is made of glass.

643
01:08:44,406 --> 01:08:47,366
This one does splinter
something terrible.

644
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:50,406
Stop rubbing it.

645
01:09:09,347 --> 01:09:12,347
What code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

646
01:09:12,437 --> 01:09:14,728
Pirates' Code.

647
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:18,648
Any man who falls behind
is left behind.

648
01:09:19,938 --> 01:09:22,268
No heroes amongst thieves.

649
01:09:23,658 --> 01:09:25,898
For having such a bleak outlook
on pirates

650
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:28,448
you're well on your way
to becoming one.

651
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:32,368
Sprung a man from jail,

652
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:34,859
commandeered a ship of the fleet,

653
01:09:34,959 --> 01:09:37,659
sailed with a buccaneer crew
out of Tortuga...

654
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:42,749
and you're completely obsessed
with treasure.

655
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:49,299
That's not true. I am not obsessed
with treasure.

656
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,220
Not all treasure is silver
and gold, mate.

657
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:02,400
Gentlemen, the time has come!

658
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,060
Salvation is nigh!

659
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:09,650
- Our torment is nearing an end!
- Elizabeth.

660
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,270
For ten years
we've been tested and tried

661
01:10:12,370 --> 01:10:17,611
and each man here has proved his mettle
a hundred times over

662
01:10:17,711 --> 01:10:20,031
and a hundred times again!

663
01:10:21,791 --> 01:10:24,331
Suffered, I have!

664
01:10:24,421 --> 01:10:30,961
Punished we were, the lot of us,
disproportionate to our crime!

665
01:10:32,891 --> 01:10:34,592
Here it is!

666
01:10:38,022 --> 01:10:41,432
The cursed treasure of Cortיs himself.

667
01:10:43,442 --> 01:10:47,772
Every last piece that went astray,
we have returned.

668
01:10:48,612 --> 01:10:50,152
Save for this!

669
01:10:50,242 --> 01:10:53,112
- Jack!
- Not yet.

670
01:10:53,822 --> 01:10:56,063
We wait for the opportune moment.

671
01:10:59,243 --> 01:11:03,873
When's that? When it's of greatest
profit to you?

672
01:11:03,963 --> 01:11:06,583
May I ask you something?

673
01:11:06,673 --> 01:11:09,163
Have I ever given you reason
not to trust me?

674
01:11:10,383 --> 01:11:15,624
Do us a favor. I know it's difficult
for you, but please stay here.

675
01:11:15,724 --> 01:11:18,044
And try not to do anything stupid.

676
01:11:21,264 --> 01:11:25,214
Who among us has paid the blood
sacrifice owed to the heathen gods?

677
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:29,014
- Us!
- And whose blood must yet be paid?

678
01:11:29,104 --> 01:11:30,764
Hers!

679
01:11:32,984 --> 01:11:37,565
You know the first thing I'm going to do
after the curse is lifted?

680
01:11:39,915 --> 01:11:43,245
Eat a whole bushel of apples!

681
01:11:51,085 --> 01:11:53,075
Begun by blood.

682
01:11:53,175 --> 01:11:55,166
By blood undone.

683
01:11:59,426 --> 01:12:03,176
Sorry, Jack.
I'm not going to be your leverage.

684
01:12:12,396 --> 01:12:14,807
That's it?

685
01:12:14,907 --> 01:12:16,397
Waste not.

686
01:12:54,359 --> 01:12:55,599
Did it work?

687
01:12:55,689 --> 01:12:58,609
- I don't feel no different.
- How do we tell?

688
01:13:05,739 --> 01:13:08,229
You're not dead!

689
01:13:08,329 --> 01:13:09,869
No.

690
01:13:11,459 --> 01:13:13,780
- He shot me.
- It didn't work.

691
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:16,410
The curse is still upon us!

692
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:23,380
You! Maid! Your father,
what was his name?

693
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:25,710
Was your father William Turner?

694
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:27,510
No.

695
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,930
Where's his child who sailed
from England eight years ago?

696
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:34,631
The child in whose veins flows
the blood of William Turner? Where?

697
01:13:41,691 --> 01:13:46,071
You two!
You brought us the wrong person!

698
01:13:47,321 --> 01:13:48,701
No!

699
01:13:48,781 --> 01:13:51,621
She had the medallion.
She's the proper age.

700
01:13:51,701 --> 01:13:54,822
She said her name was Turner.
You heard her.

701
01:13:56,082 --> 01:13:58,452
I think she lied to us.

702
01:13:59,882 --> 01:14:02,202
You brought us here for nothing.

703
01:14:02,302 --> 01:14:06,382
I won't take questioning,
not from the likes of you, Master Twigg.

704
01:14:06,472 --> 01:14:10,712
Who's to blame him? Your decisions
have led us from bad to worse!

705
01:14:12,973 --> 01:14:15,513
It was you who sent Bootstrap
to the depths!

706
01:14:19,483 --> 01:14:22,023
And it's you who brought us here
in the first place!

707
01:14:23,903 --> 01:14:27,943
If any coward here dare challenge me,
let him speak!

708
01:14:28,693 --> 01:14:33,404
I say we cut her throat
and spill all her blood. Just in case.

709
01:14:33,494 --> 01:14:34,954
Yeah!

710
01:14:43,584 --> 01:14:46,544
The medallion! She's taken it!

711
01:14:46,714 --> 01:14:50,414
Get after her, you feckless pack
of ingrates!

712
01:14:56,395 --> 01:14:59,095
- Where are the oars?
- There's no oars!

713
01:14:59,185 --> 01:15:02,105
The oars have gone missing!
Find them!

714
01:15:11,195 --> 01:15:12,696
You!

715
01:15:14,246 --> 01:15:17,246
- You're supposed to be dead.
- Am I not?

716
01:15:27,506 --> 01:15:29,496
Pearlie...

717
01:15:30,176 --> 01:15:32,416
Palu-li-la-la-lulu...

718
01:15:35,137 --> 01:15:36,967
Parlili...

719
01:15:37,057 --> 01:15:39,597
Parsnip... Parsley...

720
01:15:39,687 --> 01:15:41,927
Partner...

721
01:15:42,017 --> 01:15:44,557
- Parley?
- That's the one! Parley!

722
01:15:45,147 --> 01:15:46,257
Parley!

723
01:15:46,357 --> 01:15:48,267
Parley?

724
01:15:48,897 --> 01:15:52,728
Damn to the depths whatever muttonhead
thought of parley!

725
01:15:54,118 --> 01:15:56,108
That would be the French.

726
01:16:08,498 --> 01:16:11,418
- Not more pirates.
- Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

727
01:16:12,799 --> 01:16:13,879
Mr. Gibbs?

728
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:17,009
Hey, boy, where be Jack?

729
01:16:17,089 --> 01:16:19,589
Jack Sparrow?

730
01:16:21,389 --> 01:16:23,379
He fell behind.

731
01:16:29,939 --> 01:16:32,640
Keep to the Code.

732
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:35,520
Weigh anchor! Hoist the sails!

733
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:37,600
Split-quick, you dibbies!

734
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:46,410
How the blazes did you get
off that island?

735
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:51,370
When you marooned me
on that godforsaken spit of land,

736
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:53,831
you forgot one very important thing.

737
01:16:55,751 --> 01:16:57,751
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

738
01:16:58,341 --> 01:17:02,631
Well, I won't be making
that mistake again.

739
01:17:03,641 --> 01:17:07,141
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow?

740
01:17:07,221 --> 01:17:08,881
Aye.

741
01:17:08,981 --> 01:17:11,051
Kill him.

742
01:17:11,391 --> 01:17:14,602
The girl's blood didn't work, did it?

743
01:17:16,442 --> 01:17:18,482
Hold your fire!

744
01:17:24,242 --> 01:17:26,812
You know whose blood we need.

745
01:17:28,532 --> 01:17:31,202
I know whose blood you need.

746
01:17:37,543 --> 01:17:40,123
What sort of a man
trades a man's life for a ship?

747
01:17:40,213 --> 01:17:42,203
A pirate.

748
01:17:42,633 --> 01:17:45,753
Here. Let me.

749
01:17:45,843 --> 01:17:47,833
Thank you.

750
01:17:48,683 --> 01:17:52,184
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours.

751
01:17:53,434 --> 01:17:55,424
Why?

752
01:17:57,524 --> 01:17:59,514
I don't know.

753
01:17:59,984 --> 01:18:03,024
I'm sorry. A blacksmith's hands.

754
01:18:03,114 --> 01:18:07,654
- They're rough.
- No. I mean, yes, they are, but...

755
01:18:10,994 --> 01:18:13,075
Don't stop.

756
01:18:20,465 --> 01:18:21,875
Elizabeth.

757
01:18:37,816 --> 01:18:39,806
It's yours.

758
01:18:43,526 --> 01:18:46,946
I thought I'd lost it
the day they rescued me.

759
01:18:47,026 --> 01:18:50,476
It was a gift from my father.
He sent it to me.

760
01:18:56,747 --> 01:18:58,787
Why did you take it?

761
01:18:59,997 --> 01:19:02,577
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

762
01:19:04,377 --> 01:19:06,367
That would've been awful.

763
01:19:09,637 --> 01:19:12,838
It wasn't your blood they needed.

764
01:19:15,268 --> 01:19:17,258
It was my father's blood.

765
01:19:18,978 --> 01:19:21,298
My blood.

766
01:19:26,238 --> 01:19:29,818
- The blood of a pirate.
- Will, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

767
01:19:43,169 --> 01:19:45,329
So you expect to leave me on some beach

768
01:19:45,419 --> 01:19:48,419
with nothing but a name
and your word it's the one I need,

769
01:19:48,509 --> 01:19:52,210
and watch you
sail away in my ship.

770
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:53,460
No.

771
01:19:53,550 --> 01:19:57,680
I expect to leave you standing on some
beach with absolutely no name at all,

772
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:02,810
watching me sail away on my ship, and
then I'll shout the name back to you.

773
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:04,140
Savvy?

774
01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:06,980
But that still leaves me
standing on some beach,

775
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:11,191
with naught but a name and
your word it's the one I need.

776
01:20:12,281 --> 01:20:17,481
Of the two of us, I am the only one
who hasn't committed mutiny.

777
01:20:17,571 --> 01:20:21,521
Therefore, my word
is the one we'll be trusting.

778
01:20:21,621 --> 01:20:26,161
Although, I suppose I should be
thanking you because, in fact,

779
01:20:26,251 --> 01:20:29,371
if you hadn't betrayed me
and left me to die,

780
01:20:29,461 --> 01:20:34,172
I would have an equal share
in that curse, same as you.

781
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:36,582
Funny old world, isn't it?

782
01:20:39,182 --> 01:20:41,712
Captain! We're coming up
on the Interceptor.

783
01:20:54,903 --> 01:20:56,893
I'm having a thought here, Barbossa.

784
01:20:57,573 --> 01:21:01,273
What say we run up a flag of truce,
I scurry over to the Interceptor,

785
01:21:01,363 --> 01:21:04,653
and I negotiate the return
of your medallion?

786
01:21:05,783 --> 01:21:09,323
Now that's exactly the attitude
that lost you the Pearl.

787
01:21:09,413 --> 01:21:12,164
People are easier to search
when they're dead.

788
01:21:13,374 --> 01:21:15,374
Lock him in the brig.

789
01:21:27,514 --> 01:21:29,394
Hands aloft to loose ta'gallants!

790
01:21:29,474 --> 01:21:32,815
With this wind,
she'll carry every sail we've got.

791
01:21:32,895 --> 01:21:36,645
- What's happening?
- The Black Pearl is gaining on us!

792
01:21:40,775 --> 01:21:43,535
This is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean.

793
01:21:43,615 --> 01:21:45,945
Tell them that after they've caught us.

794
01:21:46,615 --> 01:21:49,075
- We're shallower on the draft, right?
- Aye.

795
01:21:49,165 --> 01:21:51,366
Then can't we lose them
on those shoals?

796
01:21:52,996 --> 01:21:55,916
We don't have to outrun 'em long.
Just long enough.

797
01:21:56,006 --> 01:21:58,326
Lighten the ship!
Stem to stern!

798
01:21:58,426 --> 01:22:01,586
Anything we can afford to lose,
see that it's lost!

799
01:22:10,977 --> 01:22:12,967
Apparently, there's a leak.

800
01:22:27,697 --> 01:22:30,818
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!

801
01:22:31,658 --> 01:22:33,658
And run out the sweeps.

802
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:03,679
We're gonna need that.

803
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:14,610
It was a good plan, up till now.

804
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:16,110
Gibbs!

805
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:19,790
We have to make a stand.
We must fight!

806
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,120
- Load the guns!
- With what?

807
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:25,790
Anything! Everything!
Anything we have left.

808
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,761
Load the guns!

809
01:23:29,841 --> 01:23:33,211
Case shot and langrage!
Nails and crushed glass!

810
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:37,761
With a will!

811
01:23:58,282 --> 01:24:01,322
The Pearl will luff up
on our port quarter.

812
01:24:01,412 --> 01:24:03,952
She'll rake us
without presenting a target.

813
01:24:04,042 --> 01:24:06,582
Lower the anchor on the right side.

814
01:24:06,672 --> 01:24:08,962
On the starboard side!

815
01:24:09,042 --> 01:24:12,963
- It has the element of surprise.
- You're daft, lady. You both are.

816
01:24:13,263 --> 01:24:15,303
Daft like Jack.

817
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:17,263
Lower the starboard anchor!

818
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:21,053
Do it, you gobs, or it's you
we'll load into the cannons!

819
01:24:40,034 --> 01:24:42,024
Let go!

820
01:24:47,414 --> 01:24:49,825
They're club hauling.

821
01:24:49,925 --> 01:24:52,165
Hard a port! Rack the starboard oars!

822
01:24:52,255 --> 01:24:53,965
Hard a port!

823
01:25:05,305 --> 01:25:07,305
Keep her steady, man.

824
01:25:13,696 --> 01:25:15,396
- Now!
- Fire!

825
01:25:15,486 --> 01:25:17,446
Fire all!

826
01:25:26,206 --> 01:25:28,196
Stop blowing holes in my ship!

827
01:26:14,879 --> 01:26:18,659
- We need more ideas, lass!
- It's your turn!

828
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:21,959
- We need us a devil's dowry!
- We'll give them her!

829
01:26:23,179 --> 01:26:25,499
She's not what they're after.

830
01:26:27,059 --> 01:26:28,379
The medallion.

831
01:26:50,161 --> 01:26:53,111
Strike your colors,
you bloomin' cockroaches!

832
01:26:53,201 --> 01:26:55,911
Hands, grapnels at the ready!

833
01:26:56,001 --> 01:26:57,991
Prepare to board!

834
01:27:32,283 --> 01:27:34,573
Pistols and cutlasses, men!

835
01:27:34,663 --> 01:27:37,413
Koehler, Twigg, to the powder magazine!

836
01:27:37,493 --> 01:27:40,613
And the rest of you,
bring me the medallion!

837
01:28:10,405 --> 01:28:11,515
Below!

838
01:28:31,296 --> 01:28:32,376
Thanks very much.

839
01:28:45,896 --> 01:28:47,687
Jack!

840
01:28:48,437 --> 01:28:49,897
Bloody empty!

841
01:29:06,247 --> 01:29:07,828
That's not very nice.

842
01:29:12,338 --> 01:29:14,668
- Where is the medallion?
- Wretch!

843
01:29:18,008 --> 01:29:20,298
Where is dear William?

844
01:29:21,268 --> 01:29:22,508
Will.

845
01:29:25,518 --> 01:29:26,978
Elizabeth!

846
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:32,059
Monkey!

847
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:39,569
I can't move it!

848
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:44,119
Elizabeth!

849
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:59,210
- Thank you, Jack.
- You're welcome.

850
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:01,870
Not you. We named the monkey Jack.

851
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:06,100
Gents! Our hope is restored!

852
01:30:42,092 --> 01:30:46,092
Any of you so much
as thinks the word "parley",

853
01:30:46,182 --> 01:30:48,933
I'll have your guts for garters!

854
01:30:57,063 --> 01:30:58,223
Will.

855
01:30:58,853 --> 01:31:00,853
You godless pirate!

856
01:31:01,233 --> 01:31:03,063
Welcome back, miss.

857
01:31:03,323 --> 01:31:05,853
You took advantage of our hospitality
last time.

858
01:31:05,943 --> 01:31:09,444
It holds fair now you return the favor.

859
01:31:15,164 --> 01:31:16,244
Barbossa!

860
01:31:18,254 --> 01:31:20,124
Will.

861
01:31:22,044 --> 01:31:24,084
She goes free!

862
01:31:24,174 --> 01:31:26,494
What's in your head, boy?

863
01:31:27,265 --> 01:31:29,135
She goes free.

864
01:31:29,225 --> 01:31:32,425
You've only got one shot,
and we can't die.

865
01:31:32,935 --> 01:31:35,805
Don't do anything stupid.

866
01:31:37,645 --> 01:31:40,055
You can't. I can.

867
01:31:41,815 --> 01:31:44,385
Like that.

868
01:31:44,485 --> 01:31:48,016
- Who are you?
- No one. He's no one.

869
01:31:48,116 --> 01:31:51,276
A distant cousin of my aunt's
nephew, twice removed.

870
01:31:51,366 --> 01:31:53,576
Lovely singing voice, though. Eunuch.

871
01:31:53,656 --> 01:31:58,126
My name is Will Turner!
My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.

872
01:31:58,206 --> 01:32:00,746
His blood runs in my veins.

873
01:32:00,916 --> 01:32:04,996
It's the spitting image of old
Bootstrap Bill come back to haunt us.

874
01:32:05,086 --> 01:32:07,047
On my word, do as I say,

875
01:32:07,137 --> 01:32:11,297
or I'll pull this trigger,
and be lost to Davy Jones' locker!

876
01:32:12,347 --> 01:32:14,637
Name your terms, Mr. Turner.

877
01:32:14,727 --> 01:32:17,557
- Elizabeth goes free!
- Yes, we know that one.

878
01:32:17,637 --> 01:32:19,637
Anything else?

879
01:32:21,567 --> 01:32:25,177
And the crew. The crew
are not to be harmed.

880
01:32:29,608 --> 01:32:31,158
Agreed.

881
01:32:50,379 --> 01:32:54,709
Barbossa, you lying bastard.
You swore she'd go free.

882
01:32:54,799 --> 01:32:58,799
Don't dare impugn me honor, boy.
I agreed she'd go free.

883
01:32:58,889 --> 01:33:01,839
It was you who failed to specify
when or where.

884
01:33:08,110 --> 01:33:12,520
Though it does seem a shame to lose
something so fine, don't it, lads?

885
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:16,740
So I'll be havin' that dress back
before you go.

886
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,190
I always liked you.

887
01:33:26,211 --> 01:33:28,531
Goes with your black heart.

888
01:33:29,631 --> 01:33:31,621
It's still warm.

889
01:33:34,671 --> 01:33:36,711
Off you go.

890
01:33:37,301 --> 01:33:39,291
Come on.

891
01:33:42,311 --> 01:33:44,051
Too long.

892
01:33:54,072 --> 01:33:56,562
I'd really rather hoped
we were past all this.

893
01:33:58,152 --> 01:34:01,192
Jack. Jack!

894
01:34:02,322 --> 01:34:03,872
Did you not notice?

895
01:34:03,952 --> 01:34:08,533
That be the same island that we made
you governor of on our last little trip.

896
01:34:10,003 --> 01:34:11,163
I did notice.

897
01:34:11,373 --> 01:34:15,503
Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up
another miraculous escape.

898
01:34:15,593 --> 01:34:17,583
But I doubt it.

899
01:34:20,053 --> 01:34:22,503
Off you go.

900
01:34:22,593 --> 01:34:25,083
Last time you left me a pistol
with one shot.

901
01:34:25,263 --> 01:34:29,044
By the powers, you're right.
Where be Jack's pistol?

902
01:34:29,144 --> 01:34:31,134
Bring it forward.

903
01:34:33,524 --> 01:34:38,644
Seeing as there's two of us, a gentleman
would give us a pair of pistols.

904
01:34:38,734 --> 01:34:43,314
It'll be one pistol as before, and you
can be the gentleman and shoot the lady,

905
01:34:43,404 --> 01:34:45,985
and starve to death yourself.

906
01:35:09,706 --> 01:35:13,296
That's the second time
I've watched that man take my ship.

907
01:35:15,756 --> 01:35:19,926
You were marooned on this island before.
We can escape in the same way.

908
01:35:20,096 --> 01:35:22,926
To what point and purpose, young missy?

909
01:35:23,016 --> 01:35:28,887
The Black Pearl is gone. Unless you have
a lot of sails hidden in that bodice...

910
01:35:28,977 --> 01:35:30,807
Unlikely.

911
01:35:30,897 --> 01:35:34,267
...young Mr.. Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

912
01:35:36,407 --> 01:35:38,647
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow.

913
01:35:38,867 --> 01:35:43,197
You vanished from under the eyes of
seven agents of the East India Company.

914
01:35:43,287 --> 01:35:45,988
You sacked Nassau port
without even firing a shot.

915
01:35:46,078 --> 01:35:48,998
Are you the pirate
I've read about or not?

916
01:35:50,958 --> 01:35:52,698
How did you escape last time?

917
01:35:59,388 --> 01:36:03,848
Last time I was here
a grand total of three days.

918
01:36:05,139 --> 01:36:06,629
Last time...

919
01:36:07,889 --> 01:36:11,179
the rum runners
used this island as a cache.

920
01:36:11,269 --> 01:36:14,219
They came by and I was able
to barter passage off.

921
01:36:14,319 --> 01:36:17,809
From the looks of things,
they've long been out of business.

922
01:36:17,899 --> 01:36:22,979
You probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

923
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:25,070
So that's it, then?

924
01:36:25,870 --> 01:36:29,570
That's the secret, grand adventure
of the infamous Jack Sparrow.

925
01:36:30,750 --> 01:36:34,910
You spent three days
lying on a beach drinking rum.

926
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:41,040
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

927
01:36:49,221 --> 01:36:52,391
We're devils, we're black sheep
We're really bad eggs

928
01:36:52,481 --> 01:36:54,471
Drink up, me hearties, yo ho

929
01:36:55,231 --> 01:36:56,601
Yo ho, yo ho

930
01:36:56,691 --> 01:36:59,221
A pirate's life for me

931
01:36:59,311 --> 01:37:01,221
I love this song!

932
01:37:04,241 --> 01:37:06,362
Really bad eggs!

933
01:37:11,202 --> 01:37:13,192
When I get the Pearl back,

934
01:37:13,292 --> 01:37:17,452
I'm gonna teach it to the whole crew,
and we'll sing it all the time.

935
01:37:17,542 --> 01:37:21,292
You will be the most fearsome pirates
in the Spanish Main.

936
01:37:21,382 --> 01:37:23,372
Not just the Spanish Main, love.

937
01:37:24,302 --> 01:37:27,663
The entire ocean.
The entire world!

938
01:37:28,673 --> 01:37:32,213
Wherever we want to go, we go.
That's what a ship is.

939
01:37:32,303 --> 01:37:35,093
It's not just a keel and a hull
and a deck and sails.

940
01:37:35,183 --> 01:37:38,633
That's what a ship needs.
But what a ship is...

941
01:37:40,143 --> 01:37:43,933
What the Black Pearl really is...

942
01:37:44,774 --> 01:37:46,774
is freedom.

943
01:37:48,824 --> 01:37:49,854
Jack...

944
01:37:49,944 --> 01:37:54,774
It must be really terrible for you
to be trapped on this island.

945
01:37:55,534 --> 01:37:56,704
Oh, yes.

946
01:37:56,784 --> 01:38:01,284
But the company is infinitely better
than last time.

947
01:38:01,374 --> 01:38:06,455
And the scenery has definitely improved.

948
01:38:06,545 --> 01:38:08,005
Mr. Sparrow!

949
01:38:08,095 --> 01:38:12,135
I'm not entirely sure I've had enough
rum to allow that kind of talk.

950
01:38:13,805 --> 01:38:15,795
I know exactly what you mean, love.

951
01:38:23,105 --> 01:38:24,646
To freedom!

952
01:38:27,396 --> 01:38:29,396
To the Black Pearl!

953
01:38:58,387 --> 01:38:59,417
No!

954
01:38:59,677 --> 01:39:02,517
Not good! Stop!

955
01:39:02,597 --> 01:39:04,808
Not good! What are you doing?

956
01:39:04,898 --> 01:39:07,648
You've burned all the food,
the shade, the rum.

957
01:39:07,728 --> 01:39:11,068
- Yes, the rum is gone.
- Why is the rum gone?

958
01:39:11,148 --> 01:39:15,728
One, because it is a vile drink that
turns respectable men into scoundrels.

959
01:39:16,068 --> 01:39:19,158
Two, that signal
is over 1,000 feet high.

960
01:39:19,238 --> 01:39:21,488
The entire Royal Navy is looking for me.

961
01:39:21,578 --> 01:39:25,159
Do you think there is the slightest
chance they won't see it?

962
01:39:25,249 --> 01:39:26,829
But why is the rum gone?

963
01:39:28,169 --> 01:39:31,699
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.
You give it one hour, maybe two,

964
01:39:31,799 --> 01:39:35,839
keep a weather eye open, and you
will see white sails on that horizon.

965
01:39:42,139 --> 01:39:46,270
"Must've been terrible for you
to be trapped here, Jack."

966
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:48,340
Well, it bloody is now!

967
01:39:55,780 --> 01:39:58,480
There'll be no living with her
after this.

968
01:39:58,570 --> 01:40:00,530
- But we've got to save Will.
- No.

969
01:40:00,610 --> 01:40:04,201
You're safe now. We will return
to Port Royal immediately,

970
01:40:04,281 --> 01:40:06,281
not go gallivanting after pirates.

971
01:40:06,371 --> 01:40:08,361
Then we condemn him to death.

972
01:40:09,371 --> 01:40:14,791
The boy's fate is regrettable, but
so is his decision to engage in piracy.

973
01:40:14,881 --> 01:40:18,081
To rescue me. To prevent anything
from happening to me.

974
01:40:18,171 --> 01:40:22,471
If I may be so bold as to interject
my professional opinion.

975
01:40:22,551 --> 01:40:28,222
The Pearl was listing to scuppers after
the battle. She won't make good time.

976
01:40:28,312 --> 01:40:32,222
Think about it. The Black Pearl.

977
01:40:32,312 --> 01:40:36,092
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

978
01:40:36,772 --> 01:40:39,262
How can you pass that up?

979
01:40:40,652 --> 01:40:45,063
By remembering that I serve others,
Mr. Sparrow, not only myself.

980
01:40:45,163 --> 01:40:48,773
Commodore, I beg you,
please do this for me.

981
01:40:48,873 --> 01:40:50,993
As a wedding gift.

982
01:40:51,083 --> 01:40:53,243
Elizabeth?

983
01:40:53,333 --> 01:40:55,873
Are you accepting
the Commodore's proposal?

984
01:40:58,753 --> 01:40:59,783
I am.

985
01:41:00,213 --> 01:41:03,754
A wedding. I love weddings.
Drinks all around!

986
01:41:06,054 --> 01:41:08,804
I know. "Clap him in irons," right?

987
01:41:11,354 --> 01:41:15,564
Mr. Sparrow, you will accompany
these fine men to the helm

988
01:41:15,644 --> 01:41:19,064
and provide us with a bearing
to Isla de Muerta.

989
01:41:19,144 --> 01:41:25,155
Then contemplate all possible meanings
of the phrase "silent as the grave".

990
01:41:25,365 --> 01:41:29,025
- Do I make myself clear?
- Inescapably clear.

991
01:41:32,915 --> 01:41:36,365
Shiver me timbers.

992
01:41:36,455 --> 01:41:38,495
Cotton here says you missed a bit.

993
01:41:42,875 --> 01:41:46,046
You knew William Turner.

994
01:41:46,136 --> 01:41:49,136
Old Bootstrap Bill, we knew him.

995
01:41:50,176 --> 01:41:55,676
Never sat well with Bootstrap, what we
did to Jack Sparrow, the mutiny and all.

996
01:41:56,896 --> 01:41:59,896
He said it wasn't right with the Code.

997
01:41:59,976 --> 01:42:02,977
That's why he sent off
a piece of the treasure to you.

998
01:42:04,737 --> 01:42:07,057
He said we deserved to be cursed,

999
01:42:08,237 --> 01:42:10,317
and remain cursed.

1000
01:42:10,407 --> 01:42:13,327
- Stupid blighter.
- Good man.

1001
01:42:13,407 --> 01:42:19,117
But, as you can imagine, that didn't
sit too well with the Captain.

1002
01:42:19,207 --> 01:42:21,957
That didn't sit too well
with the Captain at all.

1003
01:42:22,047 --> 01:42:25,658
- Tell him what Barbossa did.
- I'm telling the story!

1004
01:42:28,258 --> 01:42:34,968
So what the captain did, he strapped
a cannon to Bootstrap's bootstraps.

1005
01:42:35,058 --> 01:42:36,548
Bootstrap's bootstraps!

1006
01:42:36,638 --> 01:42:42,148
Last we saw of old Bill Turner, he was
sinking into the crushin' black oblivion

1007
01:42:42,228 --> 01:42:45,399
of Davy Jones' locker!

1008
01:42:46,279 --> 01:42:50,939
It was only after that we learned
we needed his blood to lift the curse.

1009
01:42:51,029 --> 01:42:53,359
That's what you call ironic.

1010
01:42:58,239 --> 01:43:00,239
Bring him.

1011
01:43:06,170 --> 01:43:08,240
I don't care for the situation.

1012
01:43:08,590 --> 01:43:11,870
Any attempt to storm the caves
could turn into an ambush.

1013
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:15,300
Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.

1014
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:19,050
I go in and get Barbossa to send
his men out in their little boats.

1015
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:25,221
Your mates return to the Dauntless
and blast them with your cannons.

1016
01:43:25,311 --> 01:43:27,601
What do you have to lose?

1017
01:43:27,691 --> 01:43:30,691
Nothing I'd lament being rid of.

1018
01:43:31,821 --> 01:43:36,611
Now, to be honest, there's a risk
to those aboard the Dauntless,

1019
01:43:36,701 --> 01:43:40,611
which includes the future Mrs. Commodore.

1020
01:43:40,701 --> 01:43:44,742
- It's for your own safety.
- I don't care, I have to tell him!

1021
01:43:44,832 --> 01:43:47,952
The pirates are cursed!
They can't be killed!

1022
01:43:48,042 --> 01:43:54,292
He's already informed of that. A mermaid
flopped up on deck and told the story.

1023
01:43:54,382 --> 01:43:57,382
This is Jack Sparrow's doing!

1024
01:44:08,023 --> 01:44:12,103
No reason to fret. A prick of the
finger, a few drops of blood...

1025
01:44:12,193 --> 01:44:17,613
No mistakes this time. He's only
half-Turner. We spill it all!

1026
01:44:19,903 --> 01:44:22,574
Guess there is reason to fret.

1027
01:44:36,294 --> 01:44:41,915
- Beg your pardon.
- Begun by blood. By blood...

1028
01:44:45,175 --> 01:44:46,835
Jack!

1029
01:44:46,935 --> 01:44:50,015
- It's not possible.
- Not probable.

1030
01:44:50,645 --> 01:44:52,845
Where's Elizabeth?

1031
01:44:53,225 --> 01:44:58,475
Safe, like I promised. She's set to
marry Norrington, like she promised,

1032
01:44:58,565 --> 01:45:00,975
and you get to die for her
like you promised.

1033
01:45:01,065 --> 01:45:06,486
So we're all men of our word, except
for Elizabeth, who is a woman.

1034
01:45:06,576 --> 01:45:09,066
Shut up! You're next!

1035
01:45:11,576 --> 01:45:16,406
- You don't want to be doing that.
- No, I think I do.

1036
01:45:18,046 --> 01:45:20,086
Your funeral.

1037
01:45:23,297 --> 01:45:26,997
- Why don't I want to be doing it?
- Because...

1038
01:45:28,017 --> 01:45:32,837
The HMS Dauntless,
pride of the Royal Navy,

1039
01:45:32,937 --> 01:45:37,727
is floating just offshore
waiting for you.

1040
01:45:46,158 --> 01:45:48,398
What are we doing here?

1041
01:45:49,238 --> 01:45:52,608
The pirates come out,
unprepared and unawares.

1042
01:45:52,698 --> 01:45:58,288
We catch 'em in a crossfire
and send 'em down to see Old Hob.

1043
01:45:58,958 --> 01:46:05,409
I meant, why aren't we doing
what Mr. Sparrow said we should do?

1044
01:46:05,509 --> 01:46:10,419
- With the cannons and all?
- Because it was Mr. Sparrow who said it.

1045
01:46:12,599 --> 01:46:15,009
You think he wasn't telling the truth?

1046
01:46:15,309 --> 01:46:17,879
Hear me out, mate.

1047
01:46:17,979 --> 01:46:21,930
Order your men to row out to the
Dauntless, they do what they do best,

1048
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:26,480
Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your
aunt... There you are with two ships.

1049
01:46:26,570 --> 01:46:28,770
The makings of your own fleet.

1050
01:46:28,860 --> 01:46:32,480
You'll take the grandest as your
flagship and who's to argue?

1051
01:46:32,570 --> 01:46:35,530
But what of the Pearl?

1052
01:46:35,620 --> 01:46:40,410
Name me captain, I'll sail under your
colors and give you 100% of me plunder

1053
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:47,251
and you get to introduce yourself
as Commodore Barbossa. Savvy?

1054
01:46:47,341 --> 01:46:51,291
And in exchange you want me
not to kill the whelp.

1055
01:46:51,381 --> 01:46:56,541
Not at all. By all means,
kill the whelp. Just not yet.

1056
01:46:56,641 --> 01:47:01,552
Wait to lift the curse
until the opportune moment.

1057
01:47:05,062 --> 01:47:06,642
For instance...

1058
01:47:08,482 --> 01:47:11,772
after you've killed Norrington's men.

1059
01:47:11,862 --> 01:47:13,442
Every...

1060
01:47:13,532 --> 01:47:15,192
last...

1061
01:47:15,282 --> 01:47:16,692
one.

1062
01:47:26,463 --> 01:47:30,373
You've planned this ever since
you learned my name.

1063
01:47:31,173 --> 01:47:32,883
Yeah.

1064
01:47:34,173 --> 01:47:36,413
I want 50% of your plunder.

1065
01:47:36,513 --> 01:47:37,713
- 15.
- 40.

1066
01:47:37,803 --> 01:47:39,263
25.

1067
01:47:39,933 --> 01:47:43,344
I'll buy you the hat.
A really big one.

1068
01:47:44,144 --> 01:47:45,974
Commodore.

1069
01:47:48,394 --> 01:47:50,554
We have an accord.

1070
01:47:51,274 --> 01:47:53,564
All hands to the boats!

1071
01:47:54,444 --> 01:47:57,364
Apologies. You give the orders.

1072
01:47:58,654 --> 01:48:02,155
Gents... take a walk!

1073
01:48:07,335 --> 01:48:09,495
Not to the boats?

1074
01:49:07,808 --> 01:49:09,848
Hold fire.

1075
01:49:12,768 --> 01:49:16,188
This is like what the Greeks
done at Troy.

1076
01:49:16,978 --> 01:49:21,979
Except they was in a horse,
instead of dresses. Wooden horse.

1077
01:49:35,209 --> 01:49:37,279
A moment, please.

1078
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:42,120
Elizabeth?

1079
01:49:44,630 --> 01:49:50,010
I want you to know I believe you made
a very good decision today.

1080
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:53,170
Couldn't be more proud of you.

1081
01:49:53,270 --> 01:49:58,850
But a good decision, if made for the
wrong reasons, can be a wrong decision.

1082
01:50:07,821 --> 01:50:09,531
Lieutenant.

1083
01:50:28,052 --> 01:50:29,882
Elizabeth?

1084
01:50:31,342 --> 01:50:33,752
Are you there?

1085
01:50:34,892 --> 01:50:37,462
Are you even listening to me?

1086
01:51:04,714 --> 01:51:06,784
What have you done?

1087
01:51:07,794 --> 01:51:10,414
Stop that! I already feel like a fool.

1088
01:51:11,424 --> 01:51:13,714
You look nice, though.

1089
01:51:17,344 --> 01:51:19,755
I look nice?

1090
01:51:55,596 --> 01:51:58,846
I must admit, Jack, I thought
I had you figured

1091
01:51:58,926 --> 01:52:02,137
but it turns out you're
a hard man to predict.

1092
01:52:02,227 --> 01:52:07,097
I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man
you can trust to be dishonest.

1093
01:52:07,187 --> 01:52:11,687
Honestly, it's the honest ones
you want to watch out for.

1094
01:52:11,777 --> 01:52:17,817
You can never predict when they're going
to do something incredibly... stupid.

1095
01:52:51,019 --> 01:52:55,319
You're off the edge of the map, mate.
Here there be monsters!

1096
01:53:00,110 --> 01:53:01,860
Right.

1097
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:05,240
What would you eat first?

1098
01:53:05,330 --> 01:53:09,490
We should decide now so we're ready
when the time comes.

1099
01:53:34,651 --> 01:53:36,681
What was that?

1100
01:53:58,633 --> 01:53:59,703
Miss Elizabeth!

1101
01:54:20,354 --> 01:54:21,904
Make for the ship! Move!

1102
01:54:31,324 --> 01:54:33,154
To the ship!

1103
01:54:35,914 --> 01:54:37,784
Row, men!

1104
01:55:15,326 --> 01:55:17,286
You can't beat me, Jack.

1105
01:55:41,728 --> 01:55:43,938
That's interesting.

1106
01:55:53,908 --> 01:55:55,948
I couldn't resist, mate.

1107
01:57:02,222 --> 01:57:03,422
Sorry!

1108
01:57:12,062 --> 01:57:14,182
What now, Jack Sparrow?

1109
01:57:14,272 --> 01:57:19,783
Are we to be two immortals, locked
in an epic battle until Judgment Day?

1110
01:57:20,493 --> 01:57:22,613
Or you could surrender.

1111
01:57:49,014 --> 01:57:52,554
All of you with me. Will is in that cave
and we must save him.

1112
01:57:52,644 --> 01:57:55,214
Ready, and... heave!

1113
01:58:01,905 --> 01:58:03,815
I need your help. Come on!

1114
01:58:03,905 --> 01:58:06,745
Any port in a storm.

1115
01:58:06,825 --> 01:58:09,285
Cotton's right. We've got the Pearl.

1116
01:58:09,365 --> 01:58:13,035
- Are you gonna leave Jack?
- Jack owes us a ship.

1117
01:58:13,285 --> 01:58:16,495
- There's the Code to consider.
- The Code?

1118
01:58:18,006 --> 01:58:22,246
You're pirates. Hang the Code
and hang the rules!

1119
01:58:22,336 --> 01:58:24,666
They're more like guidelines.

1120
01:58:28,516 --> 01:58:30,636
Bloody pirates!

1121
01:58:42,107 --> 01:58:44,267
Is it supposed to be doing that?

1122
01:58:44,357 --> 01:58:46,817
They're stealing our ship.

1123
01:58:46,907 --> 01:58:48,727
Bloody pirates!

1124
01:58:50,747 --> 01:58:52,617
Boarders away.

1125
01:59:00,918 --> 01:59:02,748
Come on!

1126
01:59:28,819 --> 01:59:30,809
Me eye!

1127
01:59:50,130 --> 01:59:52,210
I'll teach you the meaning of pain.

1128
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:54,540
You like pain?

1129
01:59:55,640 --> 01:59:57,801
Try wearing a corset.

1130
02:00:07,561 --> 02:00:09,811
Whose side is Jack on?

1131
02:00:09,901 --> 02:00:12,231
At the moment?

1132
02:00:47,273 --> 02:00:49,143
No fair!

1133
02:01:12,464 --> 02:01:16,755
Ten years you carry that pistol
and now you waste your shot.

1134
02:01:17,505 --> 02:01:20,425
He didn't waste it.

1135
02:01:45,116 --> 02:01:47,236
I feel...

1136
02:01:51,206 --> 02:01:53,616
cold.

1137
02:02:54,849 --> 02:02:57,010
Parley?

1138
02:02:57,480 --> 02:03:01,610
- The ship is ours, gentlemen.
- Huzzah!

1139
02:03:07,700 --> 02:03:10,370
Huzzah! Huzzah!

1140
02:03:47,692 --> 02:03:49,732
We should return to the Dauntless.

1141
02:03:52,202 --> 02:03:55,903
Your fiancי will want to know
you're safe.

1142
02:04:05,713 --> 02:04:09,493
If you were waiting
for the opportune moment...

1143
02:04:09,593 --> 02:04:11,833
that was it.

1144
02:04:12,803 --> 02:04:17,464
Now, I'd be much obliged
if you'd drop me off at my ship.

1145
02:04:22,314 --> 02:04:24,474
I'm sorry, Jack.

1146
02:04:26,564 --> 02:04:31,724
They done what's right by them.
Can't expect more than that.

1147
02:04:46,255 --> 02:04:48,455
Jack Sparrow...

1148
02:04:49,255 --> 02:04:51,705
Captain Jack Sparrow.

1149
02:04:52,385 --> 02:04:55,586
...for your crimes against the Crown.

1150
02:04:56,926 --> 02:05:01,386
Said crimes being numerous in quantity
and sinister in nature.

1151
02:05:02,096 --> 02:05:05,716
The most egregious of these
to be cited herewith:

1152
02:05:05,816 --> 02:05:08,436
Piracy, smuggling...

1153
02:05:08,526 --> 02:05:10,726
This is wrong.

1154
02:05:10,816 --> 02:05:15,857
Commodore Norrington is bound
by the law, as are we all.

1155
02:05:16,117 --> 02:05:19,477
...impersonating an officer
of the Spanish Royal Navy,

1156
02:05:19,577 --> 02:05:23,237
impersonating a cleric
of the Church of England,

1157
02:05:23,327 --> 02:05:28,567
sailing under false colors,
arson, kidnapping, looting,

1158
02:05:28,667 --> 02:05:32,617
poaching, brigandage, pilfering,

1159
02:05:32,707 --> 02:05:37,168
depravity, depredation
and general lawlessness.

1160
02:05:38,798 --> 02:05:45,718
For these crimes, you are sentenced
to be hung by the neck until dead.

1161
02:05:47,058 --> 02:05:49,428
May God have mercy on your soul.

1162
02:05:49,518 --> 02:05:51,678
Governor Swann.

1163
02:05:51,768 --> 02:05:53,728
Commodore.

1164
02:05:54,319 --> 02:05:56,519
Elizabeth.

1165
02:05:56,609 --> 02:06:01,319
I should have told you every day
from the moment I met you...

1166
02:06:02,829 --> 02:06:04,949
I love you.

1167
02:06:18,460 --> 02:06:20,040
Watch yourself!

1168
02:06:20,470 --> 02:06:21,930
Marines!

1169
02:06:22,010 --> 02:06:24,000
I can't breathe.

1170
02:06:24,430 --> 02:06:25,670
Elizabeth!

1171
02:06:28,850 --> 02:06:30,510
Move!

1172
02:07:43,834 --> 02:07:48,334
I thought we might have to endure
some ill-conceived escape attempt,

1173
02:07:48,424 --> 02:07:50,414
but not from you.

1174
02:07:50,514 --> 02:07:53,715
On our return to Port Royal,
I granted you clemency.

1175
02:07:53,805 --> 02:07:58,595
And this is how you thank me?
By throwing in your lot with him?

1176
02:07:58,685 --> 02:08:01,305
- He's a pirate.
- And a good man.

1177
02:08:03,105 --> 02:08:08,265
If this means the hangman will earn two
pairs of boots instead of one, so be it.

1178
02:08:08,365 --> 02:08:10,105
My conscience will be clear.

1179
02:08:10,195 --> 02:08:13,195
You forget your place, Turner.

1180
02:08:14,996 --> 02:08:19,236
It's right here, between you and Jack.

1181
02:08:22,706 --> 02:08:25,036
- As is mine.
- Elizabeth.

1182
02:08:26,586 --> 02:08:30,456
Lower your weapons.
Put them down!

1183
02:08:35,557 --> 02:08:38,507
So this is where your heart truly lies?

1184
02:08:39,847 --> 02:08:41,677
It is.

1185
02:08:50,397 --> 02:08:53,988
I'm feeling good about this.

1186
02:08:54,068 --> 02:08:56,478
We've all arrived at a special place.

1187
02:08:56,578 --> 02:09:01,868
Spiritually, ecumenically,
grammatically.

1188
02:09:02,708 --> 02:09:06,618
I want you to know
that I was rooting for you, mate.

1189
02:09:06,708 --> 02:09:08,618
Know that.

1190
02:09:11,758 --> 02:09:13,999
Elizabeth.

1191
02:09:15,389 --> 02:09:18,839
It would never have worked
between us, darling.

1192
02:09:19,099 --> 02:09:20,809
I'm sorry.

1193
02:09:23,349 --> 02:09:25,389
Will.

1194
02:09:26,519 --> 02:09:28,929
Nice hat.

1195
02:09:29,649 --> 02:09:31,389
Friends.

1196
02:09:33,740 --> 02:09:38,690
This is the day that you will always
remember as the day that...

1197
02:09:43,950 --> 02:09:46,410
Idiot. He's nowhere to go
but back to the noose.

1198
02:09:48,830 --> 02:09:50,660
Sail ho!

1199
02:09:58,261 --> 02:10:00,631
What's your plan of action?

1200
02:10:01,551 --> 02:10:03,381
Sir!

1201
02:10:07,181 --> 02:10:10,881
Perhaps on the rare occasion,
pursuing the right course

1202
02:10:10,981 --> 02:10:13,222
demands an act of piracy.

1203
02:10:13,652 --> 02:10:17,232
Piracy itself can be the right course.

1204
02:10:21,742 --> 02:10:23,782
Mr. Turner.

1205
02:10:28,792 --> 02:10:31,742
I will accept the consequences
of my actions.

1206
02:10:37,543 --> 02:10:40,003
This is a beautiful sword.

1207
02:10:42,013 --> 02:10:43,923
I expect the man who made it

1208
02:10:44,013 --> 02:10:48,423
to show the same care and devotion
in every aspect of his life.

1209
02:10:50,433 --> 02:10:52,173
Thank you.

1210
02:10:55,024 --> 02:10:57,944
Commodore! What about Sparrow?

1211
02:10:59,814 --> 02:11:04,114
I think we can afford to give him
one day's head start.

1212
02:11:09,204 --> 02:11:11,494
So...

1213
02:11:12,084 --> 02:11:15,035
This is the path you've chosen, is it?

1214
02:11:16,585 --> 02:11:20,285
After all, he is a blacksmith.

1215
02:11:21,385 --> 02:11:23,415
No.

1216
02:11:27,635 --> 02:11:29,505
He's a pirate.

1217
02:12:06,177 --> 02:12:09,207
Thought you were supposed
to keep to the Code?

1218
02:12:09,297 --> 02:12:13,168
We figured they were more
actual... guidelines.

1219
02:12:17,558 --> 02:12:19,098
Thank you.

1220
02:12:20,188 --> 02:12:22,398
Captain Sparrow.

1221
02:12:25,818 --> 02:12:28,108
The Black Pearl is yours.

1222
02:12:43,289 --> 02:12:49,079
On deck, you scabrous dogs! Hands
to braces! Let go and haul to run free!

1223
02:12:50,679 --> 02:12:54,290
Now... bring me that horizon.

1224
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:04,310
And really bad eggs.

1225
02:13:05,305 --> 02:14:05,520
