My mom's gonna kill me.

- Well, answer the question!
- No!

No, you won't answer,
or no, you won't marry me?

Jake Perry,
I'm 10 years old.

- Cool!

It's hot.
Don't touch it.

Why would you want to
marry me for anyhow?

00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:32,657
do you have a moment
for a few questions?

00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:34,995
Andrew, are you excited
about the show?

98
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,092
Uh, of course,
I'm very excited.

Did you get to
see the models?

The models? Why, uh...

101

Please tell me
he has a flaw somewhere.

Ireland for Christmas.

He's gonna ask you
a lot more than that.

- You think so?
- Mm-hmm.

what if they hate me?

Oh, they're critics, Mel.
They hate themselves.

119
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:35,121
That's easy for you to say.

120
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,821
I wasn't born with
that thick Hennings skin.

121
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,763
No, you weren't, and that
is what I love about you.

Mmm.

123

Ah, honey, I'm sorry, I got
a meeting in the Bronx.

But you go and enjoy, and
I'll see you later. Okay?

125
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:48,398
Oh, and, hey, we've got that
thing tonight at Lincoln Center.

126
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,066
What thing?

127

Fund-raiser thing.

128
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:55,144
[Sighs] Right, the thing...
with your mother.

129
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,511
That's tonight.

130
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,810
I'm afraid so.

131
00:06:57,883 --> 00:06:58,815
Okay.

132
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:01,318
I am so proud of you.

133
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,787
Thank you.

00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:04,914

His meeting's running
a little late.

138
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,376
He told me to take you inside
so you wouldn't have to wait.

139
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:31,711
Where are we?

[Horn honks]

141
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,946
- I'm so tired, Jimmy.
- Yeah.

142
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:39,388
I've just had it.

143
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,825
Well... he shouldn't be
too long.

144

Miss Carmichael,
won't you come in?

145
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,634
So... have you made a decision?

146
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,904
A-bout what?

147
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,240
Ireland.

148
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:04,339
Ireland, honey, [Scoffs]
That's four months from now.

149

2... 300 guests, tops.

150

I was thinking maybe
2... 300 guests, tops.

151
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,255
For Christmas?

152
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,850
Andrew, are you on
some sort of medication?

153
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:17,521
What's going on?
Where are we?

154
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:40,108
[Gasps] Oh, my God.

155
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,383
O-Oh, my God.

156
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,788
Oh, my God.

157
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,229
Melanie Carmichael...

158
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,426
will you marry me?

159
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,636
Are you sure?

160
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,298
I mean, a-a-are
you really sure?

161
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,308
Because if you're not sure, we
could just go back to the car.

You know I never do
anything rash.

164
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,881
And I usually never
ask a question

165

I don't already know
the answer to,

166
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:15,312
so... at the risk of
being rejected twice,

167
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,322
I'm gonna ask you again.

168
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,154
Will you marry me?

169
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,160
Yes!

00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,133
Yes! Yes!

174
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,522
Mayor, just one shot!
One shot!

175
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,061
Can you comment on
the Watson bill?

176
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,561
Over here, Mayor, please!
Over here!

177

Thank you.
Where is he?

178
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,494
He's running late.

179
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,228
No doubt thanks to
that Carbuncle girl.

181
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,930
Right, whatever.

00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,666
Right here, Mayor!

- Please, Mayor!
- Miss Mayor, over here!

184
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,707
Your Honor,
how do you answer those

185
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,641
who are opposed to
the street-improvement project

186
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,270
you put before
the city council today?

187
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,214
I suggest they take a drive on
some of the streets in Brooklyn.

188
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,150
Maybe they'll disappear
into a pothole.

189
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,779
Your son's relationship
with Melanie Carmichael...

190
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,380
sources say they're engaged.
Do you have a comment?

191
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,326
Trust me, if my son were
engaged, I'd have a comment.

192
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,392
I thought you were tired.

I've been planning
this for weeks.

I knew your show would be great,
and tonight is perfect.

197

Oh, God, I can't wait to see
the look on my mother's face.

Honey, would you
mind terribly

204
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,224
if we just kept this to
ourselves for a few days?

205
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:03,523
Mel, it's gonna come out
sooner or later.

206

No, I-I know,
I know, but, um,

207
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,132
it's just, I haven't seen
my folks in about 7 years,

208
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,569
and I just feel like I should
probably tell them in person.

209

Of course.

210
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:19,604
And, um... l-I think
I should do it alone.

211

Mel, I'm gonna have to
meet them eventually.

212

I-I know, I know, and
they will love you...

214
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,754
Is it because
I'm a Yankee?

215

Well, that...

Hello.

Why haven't you told your
mother you're engaged?

223
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,443
Have you thought
about children?

224
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,488
I'm sorry we're late.

225
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,253
That shade of lipstick does
nothing for you. What kept you?

226
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:08,816
Oh, it's none of your business.

Ah, you know I hate surprises.
What's going on?

- Hi, Your Honor.

about your new line.

What happened to the sound?

474
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:32,927
I turned it down
so I could hear the phone ring.

475
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:35,200
- Mama!
- What, are you a clairvoyant?

476
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,299
It was so loud,
I couldn't hear myself think.

477
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,641
- Mama...
- They could have heard it
at Joe and Lurlynn's house.

478
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:42,476
- Hello?
- I only get 3 minutes.

479
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:45,676
Oh, honey, you didn't need
to call, then. Just come on by.

480
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,878
Uh... well, that's the thing.

481
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:51,320
I was sorta hoping
Daddy could come get me.

482
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:57,259
Earl: So, what put you
in jail this time?

483
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,230
Melanie: Jake and
his big, fat mouth.

484
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,359
It's just a misunderstanding,
that's all.

485
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,494
Yeah, kinda like that
weddin' I paid for, huh?

486
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:07,835
I would hardly call that
a wedding.

487
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:09,204
Boy was nervous.

488
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:12,506
He was still drunk
from the night before.

489
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,011
Can you blame him?

490
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,944
Yes, I can!

491
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,176
I went to the reception
by myself with puke

492
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,276
all down my dress while he slept
it off in the Travelodge,

493
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,218
and you're still
siding with that...

Can we just
not talk about Jake, okay?

498
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:32,758
I-I know he's the son you never
had, but I'm your only daughter,

499
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,891
and maybe you want to know
what's new with me.

[Sighs] Okay, shoot.

501
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:42,834
I met somebody...

502
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:46,207
and he's quite a catch.

503
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:49,543
H-He's really a great guy.

504
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:52,778
And I'm happy... really.

Come to Mama, sugar!

Hey, Mama.

Oh, good land of the livin',
you are skin and bones.

Well, don't I get a smile?

I know you got one
in there somewhere.

let all the bought air out.

Well, are you hungry, sweetie?

512

Do you want me to reheat you
some chicken-fried steak?

513
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,742
Oh, no, Mama, I'm fine.

Sweetie, you look tired.

Are you tired?
Oh, you know what?

516

Maybe it's the way
you're wearing your hair now.

a lot with the place.

Lord, would you listen
to that accent?

Why don't you sit
in my good chair?

521
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:45,199
Now, your mama got me this
Christmas before last.

Oh, you mean the one where you
were supposed to come visit me?

523
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:51,508
I told you time and time again,
it just didn't suit.

Jake's doin' all right.
Boy's goin' places.

Once upon a time,
you were goin' places, too.

I'd rather you guys
just use them.

is how y'all will visit

every stupid battlefield
in the continental U.S.,

to visit your only daughter.

Well, the door swings
both ways, sweetie.

the things I don't understand.

of this place and be somebody.

- I'll catch up with you later.
- All right.

785
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:25,194
I'll have a Gray Goose martini,
two olives, dirty. Thanks.

786
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:27,287
# Well... #

787
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:30,060
Oh... my... God!

788
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:33,297
Melanie?!

789
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,632
Lurlynn?

790
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,640
Yes! Oh, my God!

791
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,471
L-Look at you,
all fancy.

792
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,603
You look like you just
stepped out of a magazine.

793
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,616
Oh, well, thank you.
Um, look at you.

794
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,311
You have a baby...

795
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:49,818
in a bar.

796
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,650
Hell, I got three
more at home.

797
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:54,657
This one's still on the tit,
so I can cart him anywhere.

798
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,091
- [Baby gurgles]
- Right.

799
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:00,426
I almost bought that exact same
top the other day.

800
00:40:00,497 --> 00:40:03,159
But Clinton'd kill me
if I spent 30 bucks

801
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,600
on a sweater thing.

802
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:09,571
Ah, that Jaclyn Smith
knows what she's doin'.

803
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,437
Actually, it's mine.

804
00:40:11,508 --> 00:40:13,999
Bergdorf's just picked it up.

805
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:19,177
I design clothes now.

806
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,151
Oh, mmm, now that
you mention it,

807
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:25,484
I'm... I'm pretty sure
I heard that. [Chuckles]

808
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,615
- [Cheers and applause]
- So, do you know Jaclyn Smith?

809
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:33,925
Mind if I join you?

810
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,032
Actually, we do.

811
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,001
You must be Jake's hot date.

812
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,502
I'm Starr.

813
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:43,233
Hi, I'm Melanie, Jake's
snotty Yankee-bitch wife,

814
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:44,797
whom he refuses to divorce,

815
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,105
even though
I'm engaged to another man.

816
00:40:47,177 --> 00:40:49,475
Hot dog, Jake, look at
the size of that thing.

817
00:40:49,546 --> 00:40:50,945
- Honey?
- Huh?

818
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:53,711
Why don't you get us
a couple drinks, all right?

819
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,342
Okay. [Giggles]

820
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,113
Is that a martini?

821
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:05,526
Not "me and her" us.
"You and l" us.

822
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:16,905
Why do you make me
be mean to you?

823
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,236
Is that what you want...

824
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,903
to be humiliated in front
of all of your friends?

825
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,970
Oh, come on, Mel,
we were your friends, too.

826
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:28,046
Well, looky, looky there!

827
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:29,517
Well, well, well,

828
00:41:29,586 --> 00:41:32,419
if it isn't the two
groomsmen of the apocalypse.

829
00:41:34,591 --> 00:41:36,855
- Hey, Eldon!
- Yep?

830
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,827
Are you hungry?!

831
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,454
Starved!

832
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:42,556
No, no, no!
No, don't you dare!

833
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,533
I could use a Melanie
sandwich!

834
00:41:44,601 --> 00:41:47,434
Just seems like old times,
doesn't it?

835
00:41:47,504 --> 00:41:48,562
Get off me!

836
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:49,867
Ugh!

837
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,171
No, not like old times,
all right?

838
00:41:53,243 --> 00:41:55,040
Times have changed.

839
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,979
No more Melanie sandwich,
no more Melanie taco,

840
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,448
and no more Melanie
corn dog, all right?

841
00:42:00,517 --> 00:42:02,576
- Sure... sorry.
- Just playin' with you.

842
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:03,847
Come on, guys,
just grab a stick.

843
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,047
Let's play some pool,
all right?

844
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:06,180
And if you can't find a cue,

845
00:42:06,256 --> 00:42:08,224
just pull the one
shoved up her ass.

846
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,351
[Laughter,
cheers and applause]

847
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:19,198
Eldon, you're still wearing
that same old stupid hat.

848
00:42:19,269 --> 00:42:21,567
Well, I... just about
got it broken in.

849
00:42:21,638 --> 00:42:23,868
Now, you sit your
bony ass down there

850
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,136
and watch and see me
teach Jake here

851
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,768
how to lose at pool.

852
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:30,938
Well, see, that's the thing.

853
00:42:31,014 --> 00:42:33,574
I'm not really a watch-and-see
kind of girl...

854
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,242
am I, Jake?

855
00:42:43,927 --> 00:42:47,954
Woman: Come on, now,
Bobby Ray, you got it.

856
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:49,999
[Drunkenly] Bobby Ray...

857
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,501
- [Laughs]
- [Laughs, snorts]

858
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:56,403
Don't blow this one,
okay?

859
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:57,667
All right, baby?

860
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,675
You can take the girl
out of the honky-tonk,

861
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,268
but you can't take the
honky-tonk out of the girl.

862
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,075
[All groaning]

863
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,638
Eldon: So, Jake...

864
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:10,744
are you going to divorce
this girl or what?

865
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:14,279
Well, she waited 7 years.

866
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:17,259
A couple more days
won't kill her...

867
00:43:17,327 --> 00:43:18,487
unfortunately.

868
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,757
Like it's gonna
make a difference.

869
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:22,230
You never know.

870
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:24,597
You might be interested to learn
Jake has this whole...

871
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:27,967
Hey, hey, let her think
whatever she wants, Clinton.

872
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:30,939
She made up her mind
about me a long time ago.

873
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,635
Some things never change.

874
00:43:32,709 --> 00:43:34,176
[All groaning]

875
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:36,041
Like Eldon here!

876
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:39,105
He never could get
his balls in the right pocket.

877
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:40,707
[Laughter]

878
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,685
Okay, Jake,
it's you and Mel.

879
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:44,982
Clutch time, man.

880
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:46,818
It's just like
state playoffs.

881
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,482
We're down by 6,
7 seconds to go.

882
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:52,188
We need that big, beautiful
52-yard bomb!

883
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,059
[Cheers and applause]

884
00:43:55,632 --> 00:43:57,600
Do you remember that,
Mel?

885
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:59,158
How could I forget?

886
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:02,399
That was the night
Jake got me pregnant.

887
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,735
All: Ooh.

888
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,537
Why don't you just go
public with that shit?

889
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:07,907
Oh, come on.

890
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:11,744
It's not like anybody can
keep a secret around here...

891
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,442
except for Bobby Ray.

892
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:16,042
Now, what did I
ever do to you?

893
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:18,519
You never did anything
to me, darlin'...

894
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,523
or any other girl in town.

895
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:21,580
[Laughter]

896
00:44:21,658 --> 00:44:24,218
Melanie, what is
the matter with you?

897
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:27,024
- What do you mean?
- Oh, she's just unhappy.

898
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:28,621
Well, of course,
I would be, too,

899
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:31,031
if "Women's Wear Daily"
called me "less than mediocre."

900
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:32,659
[Laughter]

901
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:37,068
Why don't you just
go to a gay bar?!

902
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,938
- Ooh!
- [Light laughter]

903
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:43,707
[Laughing] Now, what would
"B" Ray do at a gay bar?

904
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:57,018
Well...

905
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:58,789
[Pool cue clatters]

906
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,955
I think I had about
enough fun for one night.

907
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:05,193
Oh, come on,
I was just kidding.

908
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:08,067
Hey, Stella!

909
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:11,073
How 'bout another round of
drinks for my friends here?

910
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:12,870
Honey, I think you've
had about enough.

911
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:18,013
You know what?

912
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:20,709
I think you're right.

913
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:23,082
I have had enough.

914
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:26,350
I mean, how do you people live
like this, anyway?

915
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:28,584
All right, that's it,
that's it. Come on.

916
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:31,628
Did you know that there's
a great, big world out there?

917
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:35,096
It has absolutely nothin'
to do with chitlins

918
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:36,598
or children or beer!

919
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:39,158
I liked her better
when she was crazy.

920
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,498
[Sighs] Jake!

921
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:42,204
What makes you think
you can treat them

922
00:45:42,273 --> 00:45:44,241
like somethin' you stepped in
in them fancy shoes, huh?!

923
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:46,105
- You asked for it!
- I asked for it?!

924
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:48,111
You show up here,
you steal my money,

925
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:50,909
you rearrange my house, and
then you insult my friends,

926
00:45:50,982 --> 00:45:52,882
actin' like you're
better than 'em!

927
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,440
I am better than them!

928
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,986
And you stole my pen!

929
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:59,045
That's all that matters
to you, isn't it?

930
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:00,488
- Jake...
- The money...

931
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:02,321
the labels, the shoes...

932
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:03,360
you're pathetic!

933
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,826
Oh, like you're
goin' places!

934
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:06,590
Well, I am as soon as I
get my keys out of here.

935
00:46:06,664 --> 00:46:08,632
Oh, no, you don't.
No, you don't, Mel.

936
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,564
- Give me my purse!
- You want to kill yourself?

937
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:12,728
You want to kill yourself,
you do it somewhere else.

938
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:14,964
At least I'm doin'
somethin' with my life.

939
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,836
So what if you can't
play football anymore?!

940
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:18,306
- Get a new dream!
- Get in the car.

941

the mayor's son and all.

a little sweeter, doesn't it?

01:05:10,774 --> 01:05:16,337
Like when everything
went pear-shaped...

1259
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:19,780
[Voice breaking]
You never left my side.

1260
01:05:25,556 --> 01:05:28,286
And then I just left you.

1261
01:05:35,532 --> 01:05:39,662
[Crying] I bet you sat there
wondering what you'd done wrong.

1262
01:05:44,475 --> 01:05:47,410
I told him
it was my fault.

1263
01:05:49,313 --> 01:05:51,508
[Sighs]

1264
01:05:51,582 --> 01:05:53,743
[Sniffs]
Quit bein' so nice.

1265
01:05:53,817 --> 01:05:56,251
It's the truth.

1266
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:59,221
How come it has to be
so complicated?

1267
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:00,313
What?

1268
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:01,857
Truth...

1269
01:06:01,925 --> 01:06:06,191
[Sniffs] life...

1270
01:06:06,263 --> 01:06:08,231
this.

1271
01:06:10,601 --> 01:06:12,694
He was one hell
of a good dog, wasn't he?

1272
01:06:12,769 --> 01:06:16,034
[Sighs, sniffs]
Yeah.

1273
01:06:16,106 --> 01:06:20,634
You looked like you were
having fun out there tonight.

1274
01:06:22,913 --> 01:06:25,882
I'm happy
in New York, Jake.

1275
01:06:25,949 --> 01:06:28,349
[Sighs]

1276
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:32,445
But then I come down here
and...

1277
01:06:32,523 --> 01:06:34,457
this fits, too.

1278
01:06:34,525 --> 01:06:37,688
Since when does it have to be
one or the other?

1279
01:06:37,761 --> 01:06:40,355
You can have roots
and wings, Mel.

1280
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:45,532
Maybe I could just fly south
for the winter.

1281
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:51,371
Look.

1282
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:53,238
What?

1283
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:55,278
There.
Do you see 'em?

1284
01:06:59,283 --> 01:07:01,581
[Chuckles]
Lightning bugs?

1285
01:07:01,652 --> 01:07:03,916
Only you.
[Sniffs]

1286
01:07:03,987 --> 01:07:06,285
[Chuckles]

1287
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,950
You know, I still go
out there sometimes.

1288
01:07:11,161 --> 01:07:14,221
I see those big thunderheads
rollin' in.

1289
01:07:15,899 --> 01:07:18,299
It's like a religion.
[Chuckles]

1290
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:21,929
I had a dream about it
the other night.

1291
01:07:24,775 --> 01:07:26,936
You ever wonder
what would have happened

1292
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:28,910
if we hadn't have gotten
pregnant?

1293
01:07:28,979 --> 01:07:30,537
Jake...

1294
01:07:30,614 --> 01:07:32,639
Just...

1295
01:07:32,716 --> 01:07:35,810
let me get this out
before I can't.

1296
01:07:37,621 --> 01:07:39,782
I thought that baby
would be an adventure.

1297
01:07:39,856 --> 01:07:43,622
And it took me a while
to realize

1298
01:07:43,694 --> 01:07:47,425
it would have been
your only adventure.

1299
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:50,591
I just guess Mother Nature
knew better, huh?

1300
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:55,671
I was so ashamed...

1301
01:07:57,975 --> 01:08:01,968
...'cause I felt...

1302
01:08:02,045 --> 01:08:04,707
relieved.

1303
01:08:07,217 --> 01:08:12,712
And all of a sudden, I just...
needed a different life.

1304
01:08:15,859 --> 01:08:20,091
You done real well
for yourself.

1305
01:08:20,163 --> 01:08:22,393
I'm proud of you, Mel.

1306
01:08:24,234 --> 01:08:28,000
I'm just sorry I never danced
with you at our weddin'.

1307
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:36,043
I'm sure this next one's
gonna go better for ya.

1308
01:08:41,318 --> 01:08:43,479
Jake, I can't do this.

1309
01:08:43,553 --> 01:08:45,111
Hey...

1310
01:08:48,959 --> 01:08:52,258
I know.

1311
01:09:18,255 --> 01:09:19,916
Go home.

1312
01:09:33,537 --> 01:09:35,027
Well, I'm just sayin',
is all.

1313
01:09:35,105 --> 01:09:36,367
I mean, I... I saw

1314
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,203
the way you two
were lookin' at each other.

1315
01:09:38,275 --> 01:09:40,175
Will you just shut up
about it, Mama?!

1316
01:09:40,244 --> 01:09:42,303
I can't help
the way Jake feels about me!

1317
01:09:42,379 --> 01:09:43,937
He hasn't done
anything wrong!

1318
01:09:44,014 --> 01:09:45,879
He hasn't done anything right
either!

1319
01:09:45,949 --> 01:09:47,883
I can't believe I'm even
having this argument!

1320
01:09:47,951 --> 01:09:49,885
I'm leaving! I'm gone!

1321
01:09:49,953 --> 01:09:51,420
I'm marrying another man!

1322
01:09:51,488 --> 01:09:54,616
Yes, that's right, you get
a second chance, so please

1323
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:55,589
don't mess it up!

1324
01:09:55,659 --> 01:09:58,287
For who?
For me or for you?

1325
01:09:58,362 --> 01:09:59,590
Don't sass me, okay?

1326
01:09:59,663 --> 01:10:02,393
Don't you dare sass me,
'cause I have put up

1327
01:10:02,466 --> 01:10:04,559
with an awful lot from you
over the years.

1328
01:10:04,635 --> 01:10:07,627
Like what?! L-Like me quitting
your precious pageants?

1329
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:10,764
I didn't want you to
end up like me! Damn it!

1330
01:10:10,841 --> 01:10:14,470
Now, you need to stay as far
away from here as you can.

1331
01:10:14,545 --> 01:10:16,103
That boy is quicksand.

1332
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:19,513
What's so wrong
with being you, Mama?

1333
01:10:20,751 --> 01:10:24,517
I just think that you
deserve better, that's all.

1334
01:10:24,588 --> 01:10:27,455
I know you do.

1335
01:10:30,794 --> 01:10:33,092
You always have.

1336
01:10:33,163 --> 01:10:36,189
I'll see you in New York,
all right?

1337
01:10:36,266 --> 01:10:37,597
Mm-hmm.

1338
01:10:37,668 --> 01:10:39,932
You'll like it.

1339
01:10:40,003 --> 01:10:42,062
I promise.

1340
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:48,876
Now, don't you forget to
say goodbye to your daddy.

01:11:58,282 --> 01:11:59,442
Afternoon.

1361
01:11:59,516 --> 01:12:02,679
- How are ya?
- Good, thanks. Yourself?

1362
01:12:02,753 --> 01:12:05,586
No complaints.

1363

That's a beautiful house.

Sure. Yeah.

1365
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:13,254
You, uh, you here
to see Bobby Ray?

1366
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:16,731
Actually, I'm, uh,
hoping to surprise Melanie.

1367

- Melanie?
- My fiancee.

1368

You got the wrong house,
don't ya?

1369
01:12:23,307 --> 01:12:27,141
This is, uh,
the Carmichael place, isn't it?

1370

Are we talkin'
about the same girl?

- Melanie Smooter?
- Melanie Carmichael.

Oh, well,
that explains it.

I'm just, uh, talkin'
to Mel's fiance here.

where she is.

You must be...

I-I'm Bobby Ray...
her, uh, cousin?

1384
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:20,191
I see you've already met
Jake... her, uh...

1385
01:13:20,263 --> 01:13:22,254
- Other cousin.
- [Laughs]

1386
01:13:22,332 --> 01:13:24,994
Family! God, it's great
to meet you both.

1387
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:27,002
I think Melanie said
somethin' last night

1388
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:28,503
about, uh, visitin'
her daddy

1389
01:13:28,572 --> 01:13:30,267
u-up at the...
up at the battlefield.

1390
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:32,638
- The battlefield?
- You know us Southerners.

1391
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:34,301
I mean, the minute
the Confederacy died,

1392
01:13:34,378 --> 01:13:35,675
it became a moral issue.

1393
01:13:35,746 --> 01:13:39,978
Come on, I'll, uh, I'll
give you a ride up there.

1394
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:42,985
That's great. Thank you.
All right. Nice meeting you.

1395

# What this world needs
is a few more rednecks #

# So people ain't afraid
to take a stand #

1397
01:13:52,462 --> 01:13:56,489
So, who's...
Melanie... Smooter?

1398
01:13:56,566 --> 01:13:58,761
Local hero around here.

1399
01:13:58,835 --> 01:14:00,632
Why is that?

1400
01:14:00,704 --> 01:14:02,001
She blew up the bank.

1401
01:14:02,072 --> 01:14:04,336
And that made her a hero?

1402
01:14:04,408 --> 01:14:08,538
Well, notorious, anyway.
She was 10.

1403
01:14:08,612 --> 01:14:09,874
Oh.

1404
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:14,144
Fortunately, nobody was hurt...
except, maybe, the cat.

1405
01:14:14,217 --> 01:14:16,378
What cat?

1406
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:18,978
The one with the dynamite
on its back.

1407
01:14:19,056 --> 01:14:21,854
She blew up a cat?

1408
01:14:21,925 --> 01:14:24,257
- He was scheduled to die.
- From dynamite?

1409
01:14:24,327 --> 01:14:26,852
The vet said it had cancer,

1410
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:29,899
so Eldon thought it'd be put
in one of those chambers,

1411
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:32,628
you know, the ones
that suck their lungs out.

1412
01:14:32,703 --> 01:14:35,536
Little Mel, she couldn't bear
the thought of that.

1413
01:14:35,605 --> 01:14:38,039
She, uh, she wanted
somethin' more humane.

1414
01:14:38,108 --> 01:14:40,008
Yeah, sure.

1415
01:14:40,077 --> 01:14:43,240
So, they were doing some
blastin' out by the new highway.

01:14:43,313 --> 01:14:46,407
So, we, uh, we took
old Fuzz up there,

1417
01:14:46,483 --> 01:14:47,848
taped him up.

1418
01:14:47,918 --> 01:14:51,410
Used about 30 feet of fuse
just to be on the safe side,

1419
01:14:51,488 --> 01:14:53,251
said our prayers,
and ran like hell.

1420
01:14:53,323 --> 01:14:55,223
Of course.

1421
01:14:55,292 --> 01:14:57,192
So, there we were,
sittin' in Virgie's Diner,

1422
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:59,785
feelin' pretty blue.

1423
01:14:59,863 --> 01:15:01,888
When Mel looks up and sees
that damn cat,

1424
01:15:01,965 --> 01:15:05,093
trottin' down the road,
searchin' for Eldon.

1425
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:07,534
No shit.

1426
01:15:07,604 --> 01:15:09,367
Yeah, and we
would have caught him, too,

1427
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:12,636
but once that fuse hit his tail,
boom, he took off like a shot.

1428
01:15:12,709 --> 01:15:14,108
And into the bank.

1429
01:15:14,177 --> 01:15:16,737
Well... the theory is,

1430
01:15:16,813 --> 01:15:18,804
he probably wriggled loose
from the explosive.

1431
01:15:18,882 --> 01:15:22,283
'Cause, uh, people still
see him from time to time,

1432
01:15:22,352 --> 01:15:24,047
scorched tail and all.

1433
01:15:24,121 --> 01:15:27,386
He's a little skittish
around humans.

1434
01:15:27,457 --> 01:15:29,891
That's quite a story.

1435
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:32,053
She was quite a girl.

1436
01:15:32,129 --> 01:15:34,996
# A little less talk
and a little more action #

1437
01:15:35,065 --> 01:15:36,999
Whatever happened to her?

1438
01:15:37,067 --> 01:15:38,398
# And a few more rednecks... #

1439
01:15:38,468 --> 01:15:41,699
Oh, you know...
wound up pregnant,

1440
01:15:41,772 --> 01:15:45,799
married some loser
right out of high school.

1441
01:15:45,876 --> 01:15:51,246
[Trumpet playing "Taps"]

1442
01:16:04,561 --> 01:16:05,892
["Taps" ends]

1443
01:16:05,962 --> 01:16:08,988
[Whistling,
cheers and applause]

1444
01:16:19,242 --> 01:16:21,710
Are you surprised?

1445
01:16:25,182 --> 01:16:27,013
What are you doing here?

1446
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:29,210
Well, I came to deliver
your fiance.

1447
01:16:29,286 --> 01:16:30,548
I think
she was talking to me.

1448
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:31,678
Jake...

1449
01:16:31,755 --> 01:16:33,382
Must be exhaustin'.

1450
01:16:33,456 --> 01:16:34,388
- What?
- What?

1451
01:16:34,457 --> 01:16:35,947
Livin' a lie.

1452
01:16:36,026 --> 01:16:37,220
What's he talking about?

1453
01:16:38,728 --> 01:16:41,697
You and I are in love
with two different people.

1454
01:16:47,604 --> 01:16:50,072
Is he a second cousin?

1455
01:16:51,208 --> 01:16:52,971
He's my husband.

1456
01:16:53,043 --> 01:16:54,203
Your what?

1457
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:55,301
I mean my ex-husband.

1458
01:16:55,378 --> 01:16:56,845
You married your cousin?!

1459
01:16:56,913 --> 01:16:59,643
No, I came down here
to finalize my divorce.

1460
01:16:59,716 --> 01:17:02,207
Hey, darlin',
thought that was you.

1461
01:17:04,788 --> 01:17:06,483
Must be your new someone.

1462
01:17:08,091 --> 01:17:10,025
Earl Smooter...
glad to meet ya.

1463
01:17:13,897 --> 01:17:15,558
Melanie Smooter.

1464
01:17:18,401 --> 01:17:19,368
Andrew, wait.

1465
01:17:19,436 --> 01:17:21,028
Wait!

1466
01:17:21,104 --> 01:17:24,039
Andrew! Wait!

1467
01:17:24,107 --> 01:17:25,039
I just...

1468
01:17:25,108 --> 01:17:26,234
Please.

1469
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:28,174
Let me try
and explain myself!

1470
01:17:28,245 --> 01:17:30,213
You don't understand!

1471
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,680
This is not
who I am anymore!

1472
01:17:32,749 --> 01:17:34,740
Look, I don't know who you are
or what else you lied about,

1473
01:17:34,818 --> 01:17:36,251
but I know one thing...

1474
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:39,948
there is a Lear Jet
in Mobile, and I am on it.

1475
01:17:41,992 --> 01:17:44,290
[Sighs]

1476
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:01,909
I know you're thinkin'

1477
01:18:01,978 --> 01:18:04,708
I spoiled things good
this time.

1478
01:18:04,781 --> 01:18:08,478
Oh, hon, don't go accusin' me
of thinkin'.

1479
01:18:08,551 --> 01:18:11,679
I ain't done
anything of the sort.

1480
01:18:11,755 --> 01:18:14,747
Anyway, spoiled's in the eye
of the beholder...

1481
01:18:16,393 --> 01:18:17,883
...like these plums here.

1482
01:18:17,961 --> 01:18:21,727
Some people might
call them "spoiled"...

1483
01:18:21,798 --> 01:18:26,064
but I think that, um,
these almost-ruined ones

1484
01:18:26,136 --> 01:18:29,071
sometimes make
the sweetest jam.

1485
01:18:31,074 --> 01:18:32,974
Do you need any help?

1486
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:36,669
It was kind of fun,

1487
01:18:36,746 --> 01:18:39,010
seeing Daddy up there,
surrendering.

1488
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:41,072
Yeah.

1489
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:43,914
He sure does have
a flair for the dramatic.

1490
01:18:43,986 --> 01:18:47,114
You certainly don't get it
from my side of the family.

1491
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,056
Hey, y'all.

1492
01:18:51,127 --> 01:18:53,459
Look who I found
walkin' down l-58.

1493
01:18:53,529 --> 01:18:55,326
Hi.

1494
01:18:55,398 --> 01:18:58,231
Hi.

1495
01:19:00,136 --> 01:19:03,537
I thought you'd be
halfway to New York by now.

1496
01:19:03,606 --> 01:19:06,632
So did I.

1497
01:19:06,709 --> 01:19:10,042
Ooh, if I'd known
company was comin',

1498
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:12,307
I'd have put on the dog.

1499
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,614
This is my mama.

1500
01:19:15,685 --> 01:19:18,017
Hi.

1501
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:19,987
She makes the best jam
in three counties.

1502
01:19:20,056 --> 01:19:22,149
[Scoffs] Oh.

1503
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:24,818
And my dad...
you... you already met him.

1504
01:19:24,894 --> 01:19:26,020
Yeah.

1505
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:30,827
And this is our home.

1506
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,368
This is where I grew up.

1507
01:19:34,737 --> 01:19:37,001
Well, it's a pleasure
meeting you both.

1508
01:19:37,073 --> 01:19:39,371
I'm... Andrew Hennings...

1509
01:19:39,442 --> 01:19:41,672
Melanie's fiance...

1510
01:19:41,744 --> 01:19:46,374
well... that is... if...
if she'll still have me.

1511
01:19:51,754 --> 01:19:54,450
Look, Mel...

1512
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:57,959
I really don't care
what happened down here.

1513
01:19:58,027 --> 01:19:59,961
So... you have a past.

1514
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:01,997
I mean, who doesn't?

1515
01:20:07,603 --> 01:20:09,537
What I need to know

1516
01:20:09,605 --> 01:20:13,234
is if there is a place for me
in your future.

1517
01:20:13,309 --> 01:20:18,246
Oh, good Lord.
That is the sweetest thing.

1518
01:20:19,849 --> 01:20:21,248
Well, go on.

1519
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:30,417
Oh! Hello, New York City!

1520
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:32,893
Woman, what the hell
you gassin' about?

1521
01:20:32,962 --> 01:20:35,328
Well, sir...

1522
01:20:35,398 --> 01:20:37,491
my mother happens to be
the mayor up there,

1523
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:39,534
and, uh, she'd like
nothing better

1524
01:20:39,602 --> 01:20:42,070
than a big, snazzy
New York wedding.

1525
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:46,599
Well, uh...

1526
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:49,143
yeah, I suppose
I can take off work.

1527
01:20:51,747 --> 01:20:54,545
Andrew, I, um...
actually, I was thinking,

1528
01:20:54,617 --> 01:20:56,642
maybe we could have
the wedding here.

1529
01:20:59,488 --> 01:21:00,580
Here.

1530
01:21:00,656 --> 01:21:02,920
In my hometown.

1531
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:06,154
Look, Mel, if you're worried
about the money, don't.

1532
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:08,662
It's not about
the money, Andrew...

1533
01:21:08,731 --> 01:21:09,959
not down here.

1534
01:21:13,269 --> 01:21:15,635
You know...
a lot of people

1535
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:19,231
are expecting us
to get married in the city,

1536
01:21:19,308 --> 01:21:21,606
but I think a nice,
quiet, country wedding

1537
01:21:21,677 --> 01:21:22,803
is just the ticket.

1538
01:21:24,747 --> 01:21:26,806
Earl...

1539
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,440
Pearl, if you...
if you folks could

1540
01:21:28,517 --> 01:21:30,883
take care
of the rehearsal dinner,

1541
01:21:30,953 --> 01:21:33,820
I'd really like
to take care of the rest.

1542
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:36,449
Well, I think
we could cover that.

1543
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:39,660
Heck. [Chuckles]

1544
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:43,027
How many times does
your only daughter get married?

1545
01:21:43,099 --> 01:21:45,795
[Chuckling]

1546
01:21:47,703 --> 01:21:50,797
Other than before.

1547
01:21:50,873 --> 01:21:52,534
Felony Melanie?

1548
01:21:52,608 --> 01:21:53,768
She was never convicted.

1549
01:21:53,843 --> 01:21:55,003
Oh-ho.

1550
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:56,977
I don't know
which is worse...

1551
01:21:57,046 --> 01:21:59,674
child cat killer
or sons of the Confederacy.

1552
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:02,774
What would you suggest I do...
dump her for being poor?

1553
01:22:02,852 --> 01:22:04,717
You're supposed to be
a Democrat, remember?

1554
01:22:04,787 --> 01:22:06,755
There is nothing wrong
with being poor.

1555
01:22:06,822 --> 01:22:08,380
I get elected by poor people,

1556
01:22:08,457 --> 01:22:10,357
and I'm a big enough person
to commend her

1557
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:12,485
for making something of herself.

1558
01:22:12,561 --> 01:22:14,552
What upsets me
is that she lied to you.

1559
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:17,121
So what? She was ashamed
of her background.

1560
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:20,032
Who hasn't been embarrassed by
their parents at one point?

1561
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:22,832
I'm going to assume that
was a rhetorical question.

1562
01:22:22,905 --> 01:22:24,668
Assume away.

1563
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:29,809
[Sighs] No one is going to
change my mind about this...

1564
01:22:29,879 --> 01:22:32,074
not you, not the media,
not anyone.

1565
01:22:32,148 --> 01:22:35,174
Fine...

1566
01:22:35,251 --> 01:22:38,345
but admit it...
I was right.

1567
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:40,980
Yes... you were right.

1568
01:22:43,025 --> 01:22:44,652
There is a wedding
in your future,

1569
01:22:44,727 --> 01:22:46,558
whether you like it or not.

1570
01:22:48,364 --> 01:22:51,094
And how, exactly,
does Little Miss Alabama

1571
01:22:51,167 --> 01:22:53,294
plan to accommodate
500 people?

1572
01:22:53,369 --> 01:22:55,360
I suppose she has connections
at the jail.

1573
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:57,098
Well, there are
several excellent choices...

1574
01:22:57,173 --> 01:23:00,609
