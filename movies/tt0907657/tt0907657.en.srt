Well, the healing has begun

3
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:51,771
I want you to put on
your pretty summer dress, yeah

4
00:00:51,813 --> 00:00:53,399
You can wear
your Easter clothes

5
00:00:53,482 --> 00:00:58,153
Sunday bonnet
and all the rest

6
00:00:58,237 --> 00:01:03,617
But I want to make love
to you, yes, yes, yes, yes

7
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,705
Well, the healing

8
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:12,585
Well, the healing

14
00:01:36,652 --> 00:01:39,404
- So fuck off, right?
- Hell, I'm just tying my fuckin' lace and everything.

15
00:01:39,488 --> 00:01:40,489
Fuck's sake.

16
00:01:40,572 --> 00:01:42,783
Look here. Here.

17
00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:44,743

00:01:47,746 --> 00:01:48,789

20
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:55,629
Oh, yeah, la-la

21
00:01:58,675 --> 00:02:01,635
Hmm-mm...

22
00:02:03,888 --> 00:02:05,599
- Hold that will you?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:05,682 --> 00:02:06,725
Thanks.

24
00:02:28,163 --> 00:02:30,165
Anton, fucking hell, man.

25
00:02:30,249 --> 00:02:32,501
Come on, give me that.

26
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:34,337
Give me the case.

27
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:35,964
What are you fucking at, man?

28
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:39,009
For fuck's sake.

29
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:40,885
- I'm...
- What are you at, man?

30
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,220
I'm sorry, man,

31
00:02:42,303 --> 00:02:45,431
I'm just fucking dying sick,
man, you know what I mean?

32
00:02:45,514 --> 00:02:47,393
Here, I'll go
on and help you.

33
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:50,395
- Oh, fuck.
- There's all your money.

34
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,397
I'm just dying
sick and all.

35
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,150
Look, there's 20 cent.
Look it.

36
00:02:56,485 --> 00:02:58,653
Look, don't fucking rob me.

37
00:02:58,737 --> 00:03:01,073
I'm down there trying to fucking
make a living like anyone else.

38
00:03:01,156 --> 00:03:03,576
The two of us is on
the same team, man.

39
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:04,952
I'm sorry, right,
I'm sorry, man.

40
00:03:05,035 --> 00:03:07,037
But you're right.
You're rapid, you are.

41
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:08,790
You want money, just fucking,
just ask me for it.

42
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:11,250
Don't have me chase you all
the way up the street for it.

43
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:15,630
Want to give us that
fiver then, do ya?

44
00:03:15,713 --> 00:03:19,884
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Here.

45
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:21,469
How's your ma?

46
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:23,555
She's dead, man.

47
00:03:23,597 --> 00:03:24,806
Well, how's your old fella?

48
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:27,391
Fair play to ya, right?

49
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:29,603
I'll see you later,
all right.

50
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:31,397
Look, there's two euros, look.

51
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,815
Fair play to ya, right?

52
00:03:32,898 --> 00:03:34,566
See you, good luck, man.

53
00:04:00,177 --> 00:04:03,680
Scratching
at the surface now

54
00:04:06,308 --> 00:04:10,478
And I'm trying hard
to work it out

55
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:17,736
And so much has gone
misunderstood

56
00:04:20,156 --> 00:04:24,785
And this mystery
only leads to doubt

57
00:04:27,788 --> 00:04:31,042
And I didn't understand

58
00:04:33,502 --> 00:04:38,007
When you reached out
to take my hand

59
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:44,973
And if you have
something to say

60
00:04:47,976 --> 00:04:51,354
You'd better say it now

61
00:04:51,396 --> 00:04:55,274
'Cause this is
what you've waited for

62
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:01,865
Your chance to even up
the score

63
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:08,330
And as these shadows fall

64
00:05:08,372 --> 00:05:14,128
On me now I'll win somehow

65
00:05:14,212 --> 00:05:16,630
Yeah

66
00:05:16,714 --> 00:05:23,679
'Cause I'm picking up
a message, Lord

67
00:05:23,762 --> 00:05:30,270
That I'm closer
than I've ever been before

68
00:05:30,353 --> 00:05:34,524
So if you have something
to say

69
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:37,318
Say it to me now

70
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,868
Just say it to me now, now

71
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:52,250
Oh, oh

72
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:55,338
Oh

73
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,298
Oh.

74
00:06:12,356 --> 00:06:13,773
Thanks.

75
00:06:13,857 --> 00:06:16,568
Ten cents,
brilliant. Thanks.

76
00:06:16,652 --> 00:06:18,403
Excuse me?

77
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:20,572
Sorry.

78
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:23,618
Big Issue?

79
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,995
Can't afford it.

80
00:06:26,078 --> 00:06:29,582
This song you just play,
you write it?

81
00:06:29,624 --> 00:06:31,250
Working on it.

82
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:33,127
It's not an established song?

83
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,504
No, it's not an
established song.

84
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:36,839
How come you don't play it

85
00:06:36,923 --> 00:06:37,966
during daytime?

86
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,467
I see you every day.

87
00:06:39,551 --> 00:06:42,470
You know, during the day, people
want to hear songs they know,

88
00:06:42,553 --> 00:06:44,014
just songs that they recognize.

89
00:06:44,097 --> 00:06:45,599
I mean, otherwise,
I wouldn't make any money.

90
00:06:45,682 --> 00:06:47,433
I play these songs at night.
They wouldn't listen.

91
00:06:47,517 --> 00:06:49,477
I listen.

92
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,273
Yeah, but you gave me ten cents.

93
00:06:52,356 --> 00:06:54,566
You do it
for money then?

94
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,984
Why don't you
get a job

95
00:06:56,026 --> 00:06:57,194
in a shop?

96
00:06:57,277 --> 00:07:00,280
I have a job in a shop.

97
00:07:00,364 --> 00:07:02,491
Listen, I'm going to get
back to this, yeah?

98
00:07:02,574 --> 00:07:03,700
Nice to meet you.

99
00:07:03,783 --> 00:07:06,036
Who'd you write that song
for, please?

100
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,539
No one.

101
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:14,962
Bullshit.

102
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:16,505
Where is she?

103
00:07:16,547 --> 00:07:19,968
She's gone.

104
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:21,887
She's dead?

105
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,348
No, she's not dead, she's gone.

106
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,142
You love her still?

107
00:07:27,184 --> 00:07:29,311
Jesus, man.

108
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:35,651
You're over her.

109
00:07:35,735 --> 00:07:36,902
Rubbish.

110
00:07:36,986 --> 00:07:39,029
No one who would write
this song is over her.

111
00:07:39,113 --> 00:07:40,739
I'm telling you.

112
00:07:40,822 --> 00:07:43,659
You play this marvelous song
to her, you get her back.

113
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:45,702
I don't want her back.

114
00:07:45,744 --> 00:07:48,581
I see.

115
00:07:48,664 --> 00:07:51,543
What shop you work in?

116
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:53,503
I work in a Hoover repair shop.

117
00:07:53,544 --> 00:07:54,837
A Hoover?

118
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,507
You know, like a vacuum cleaner.
Whhzzz.

119
00:07:57,549 --> 00:07:59,717
You fix vacuum cleaners?

120
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,843
I do.

121
00:08:00,926 --> 00:08:03,888
I have a broken vacuum cleaner.

122
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,682
- You fix it for me?
- Yeah.

123
00:08:05,724 --> 00:08:07,434
I bring it tomorrow then?

124
00:08:07,517 --> 00:08:08,393
Okay.

125
00:08:08,435 --> 00:08:09,394
This is great.

126
00:08:09,477 --> 00:08:10,396
Tomorrow?

127
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,438
Right.

128
00:08:11,522 --> 00:08:13,398
- Okay, bye.
- Good luck.

129
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:24,159
You have broken me
all the way down

130
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:28,622
Down upon my knees

131
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:38,424
And you have broken me
all the way now

132
00:08:45,347 --> 00:08:47,560
Hi. This is Catherine.

133
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:49,186
Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

134
00:09:06,787 --> 00:09:13,669
I'll be far to sea

135
00:09:20,718 --> 00:09:22,220
That job's ready
for collection now, Dad.

136
00:09:22,304 --> 00:09:23,930
Okay, son.

137
00:09:24,014 --> 00:09:25,390
I'm going to head into town.

138
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,688
Should I turn this
around for you?

139
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:33,857
What'll I get for dinner?

140
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,483
The fish, maybe.

141
00:10:01,595 --> 00:10:02,554
Hello.

142
00:10:02,637 --> 00:10:04,680
How are you? How's it going?

143
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:06,183
I bring you my Hoover.

144
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,480
All right.

145
00:10:12,522 --> 00:10:14,483
What's wrong with it?

146
00:10:14,525 --> 00:10:16,527
It is fucked.

147
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,403
It doesn't suck up
the dirt.

148
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:19,989
Well, listen, there's
nothing I can do,

149
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,865
I don't have any of my
tools or nothing with me.

150
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:23,408
I'm going on me break now.

151
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:25,160
Can you bring it in
tomorrow or something?

152
00:10:25,202 --> 00:10:27,246
Well, no, I bring it today.

153
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:30,833
- You, you...
- Yeah, but there's nothing I can do with it, love,

154
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,001
I don't have
me tools, or...

155
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:33,836
It's like I have
to bring it home.

156
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,756
If I come on break, you have
a look at it at least?

157
00:10:38,674 --> 00:10:40,175
Yeah, but you
don't understand.

158
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:41,761
I come with you, then?

159
00:10:41,844 --> 00:10:44,306
For lunch?

160
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:45,348
Yeah, all right.

161
00:10:45,432 --> 00:10:46,850
- Yes, we go together?
- Yeah.

162
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:48,602
Okay.

163
00:10:48,685 --> 00:10:50,687
Thank you.

164
00:10:50,771 --> 00:10:52,731
- You hungry?
- I'm always hungry.

165
00:11:01,615 --> 00:11:06,203
So you know a bit
about music then?

166
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:11,334
My father used to play in
the orchestra back at home.

167
00:11:11,418 --> 00:11:14,003
He played violin.

168
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:18,800
But he got arthritis then,
and he killed himself.

169
00:11:18,883 --> 00:11:20,259
Really?

170
00:11:20,301 --> 00:11:24,054
But before he go, he teach me
how to play piano.

171
00:11:24,096 --> 00:11:26,433
"It's not so hard
on the fingers," he said.

172
00:11:26,517 --> 00:11:29,561
Do you get to play much?

173
00:11:29,644 --> 00:11:32,773
Hmm. No, I don't, I don't
have a piano at home.

174
00:11:32,856 --> 00:11:34,900
I can't get one in Ireland;
it's so much money.

175
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:36,192
I can't afford it.

176
00:11:38,194 --> 00:11:39,529
Yeah, it's expensive
all right.

177
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:50,666
I play in a
piano shop.

178
00:11:50,749 --> 00:11:52,125
This man lets me play...

179
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:54,462
one hour per day
at lunch.

180
00:11:54,546 --> 00:11:57,131
Somewhere around here?

181
00:11:57,215 --> 00:11:58,508
You want to
hear me play?

182
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,510
- Yeah.
- Now?

183
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,553
Yeah.

184
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:03,846
Okay.

185
00:12:07,016 --> 00:12:08,184
Can we come in?

186
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:19,779
This is the man
I was telling you about.

187
00:12:19,821 --> 00:12:20,947
He's a real gentleman.

188
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,990
Hi.

189
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:23,242
Okay for me
to play today?

190
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,452
Yeah, that's fine.

191
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,620
Thanks.

192
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,122
Not the baby Yamaha
though. She's sold.

193
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:29,248
- Okie-dokie.
- Mm-hmm.

194
00:12:35,837 --> 00:12:37,841
Now, which one today?

195
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,128
That kind of thing.

196
00:13:56,548 --> 00:13:58,800
It's amazing.

197
00:13:58,883 --> 00:13:59,884
Did you write that?

198
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:02,803
No, no, Mendelssohn did.

199
00:14:02,887 --> 00:14:03,930
It's good.

200
00:14:04,013 --> 00:14:06,058
It's good, yes.

201
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:08,268
Play me another
of your songs.

202
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:09,269
No.

203
00:14:09,352 --> 00:14:10,270
Please.

204
00:14:10,354 --> 00:14:11,313
Not here.

205
00:14:11,396 --> 00:14:13,064
Why? Here, Billy
doesn't mind.

206
00:14:13,148 --> 00:14:15,817
- You think it would be all right?
- Yes.

207
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:19,155
Okay.

208
00:14:19,238 --> 00:14:20,739
Let's put that there, yeah?

209
00:14:20,823 --> 00:14:21,824
Mm-hmm.

210
00:14:24,117 --> 00:14:25,995
This is in C, yeah?

211
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:28,080
Yeah, okay,
I can see that.

212
00:14:28,163 --> 00:14:29,498
Okay.

213
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:32,418
So, it goes, um...

214
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:36,756
Da... It goes,
Da-da-da-da

215
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:44,221
Da-da-da-da,
da-da-da-da-da

216
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:45,973
Yeah? And then there's
a bit in there...

217
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:47,393
Can you do that?

218
00:14:49,186 --> 00:14:55,776
Da-da-da-da-da...

219
00:14:55,859 --> 00:14:56,985
Brilliant.

220
00:14:57,068 --> 00:14:58,778
And then there's another
part that goes, uh...

221
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:02,325
Ba-ba-pa-pa-pa

222
00:15:02,408 --> 00:15:06,412
Ba-ba-pa-pa-pa

223
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,291
Ba-ba-pa-pa-pa

224
00:15:10,332 --> 00:15:12,459
Yeah? And then the
chorus, let's see.

225
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:13,752
- You have those two bits?
- Mm-hmm.

226
00:15:13,835 --> 00:15:14,962
And the chorus goes...

227
00:15:15,004 --> 00:15:19,133
Da-da-da-da-da

228
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:26,140
Pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa

229
00:15:26,182 --> 00:15:33,023
Ba-ba... da-da.

230
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:34,566
That's it. Perfect. Brilliant.

231
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:36,444
So, do you want
to give it a spin?

232
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:39,988
- Yes, try it.
- Okay.

233
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,823
Two, three,

234
00:15:41,906 --> 00:15:43,032
four.

235
00:15:57,547 --> 00:16:04,722
I don't know you,
but I want you

236
00:16:04,806 --> 00:16:12,271
All the more for that

237
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:19,739
And words fall through me
and always fool me

238
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:25,243
And I can't react

239
00:16:25,327 --> 00:16:27,413
We change here.

240
00:16:27,496 --> 00:16:35,755
And games that never amount
to more than they're meant

241
00:16:35,838 --> 00:16:40,968
Will play themselves out

242
00:16:41,051 --> 00:16:42,303
Hold it.

243
00:16:42,386 --> 00:16:43,847
And the chorus.

244
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:53,981
Take this sinking boat
and point it home

245
00:16:54,065 --> 00:17:00,114
We've still got time

246
00:17:00,197 --> 00:17:04,910
Raise your hopeful voice

247
00:17:04,994 --> 00:17:08,205
You had the choice

248
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:15,755
You've made it now

249
00:17:18,758 --> 00:17:26,266
Falling slowly,
eyes that know me

250
00:17:26,308 --> 00:17:30,478
And I can't go back

251
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:41,282
Moods that take me
and erase me

252
00:17:41,365 --> 00:17:48,664
And I'm painted black

253
00:17:48,706 --> 00:17:57,298
Well, you have suffered enough
and warred with yourself

254
00:17:57,382 --> 00:18:01,845
It's time that you won

255
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:05,640
Again.

256
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:15,567
Take this sinking boat
and point it home

257
00:18:15,651 --> 00:18:21,948
We've still got time

258
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:26,704
Raise your hopeful voice

259
00:18:26,787 --> 00:18:29,957
You had the choice

260
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:37,340
You've made it now

261
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:48,392
Uh-huh, uh-huh,
uh-huh...

262
00:18:52,189 --> 00:18:53,774
Yeah

263
00:18:53,857 --> 00:19:01,990
Take this sinking boat
and point it home

264
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:08,414
We've still got time

265
00:19:08,456 --> 00:19:12,919
Raise your hopeful voice

266
00:19:13,002 --> 00:19:22,721
You had the choice,
you've made it now

267
00:19:22,804 --> 00:19:30,728
Falling slowly,
sing your melody

268
00:19:30,812 --> 00:19:37,736
I'll sing along...

269
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:56,339
Ah, ah...

270
00:20:00,718 --> 00:20:02,846
Call and I'll sing along.

271
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:35,672
I moved back in
about a year ago,

272
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:38,842
after me ma died, just to
help me dad out, you know.

273
00:20:41,761 --> 00:20:43,512
So tell me about her.

274
00:20:43,596 --> 00:20:45,514
Who, me ma?

275
00:20:45,556 --> 00:20:50,520
No, the girl, the special girl
you write these songs for.

276
00:20:50,562 --> 00:20:51,813
No.

277
00:20:51,896 --> 00:20:54,149
Come on.

278
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:55,901
What did she do to you?

279
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:02,825
Well.

280
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:11,125
Ten years ago, I fell in
love with an Irish girl

281
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:14,127
She took my heart

282
00:21:14,211 --> 00:21:19,801
But she went and screwed
some guy that she knew

283
00:21:19,884 --> 00:21:24,806
And now I'm in Dublin
with a broken heart

284
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:30,145
Oh, broken-hearted
Hoover-fixer sucker guy

285
00:21:30,228 --> 00:21:34,483
Oh, broken-hearted
Hoover-fixer sucker...

286
00:21:34,566 --> 00:21:38,153
Sucker guy

287
00:21:38,237 --> 00:21:42,407
One day, I'll go there
and win her once again

288
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:48,914
But until then, I'm just
a sucker of a guy.

289
00:21:55,421 --> 00:21:58,758
So she's with him now?

290
00:21:58,841 --> 00:21:59,843
- No.
- Don't know.

291
00:21:59,926 --> 00:22:00,886
Where is she?

292
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:06,850
She's in old London town

293
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:13,816
Living somewhere
around Chiswick.

294
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,698
I miss her.
It's just sort of... you know.

295
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:24,076
You're not going
to go get her?

296
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:26,954
No?

297
00:22:27,037 --> 00:22:30,249
No. Fuck her.

298
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,251
Fuck her,
fuck her.

299
00:22:32,293 --> 00:22:33,752
Fuck her, she's gone

300
00:22:33,794 --> 00:22:36,756
Fuck her, she's gone forever

301
00:22:36,797 --> 00:22:38,466
She fucking fucked it up...!

302
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:41,177
Sorry.

303
00:22:41,261 --> 00:22:44,347
Fucking fucked it up

304
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:47,433
She fucking fucked it up!

305
00:22:47,475 --> 00:22:49,644
And now she's gonna die.

306
00:22:59,905 --> 00:23:02,365
Give us the sharp eight
there, son.

307
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:09,956
And the Phillips.

308
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,001
Come on.

309
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,714
Your son
is a very talented man, sir.

310
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:19,509
Well, he should be.
I trained him meself.

311
00:23:19,592 --> 00:23:21,302
Oh, no. I meant the songs.

312
00:23:21,385 --> 00:23:23,470
Oh, right. Is he?

313
00:23:23,512 --> 00:23:25,306
- Very.
- Okay, that's done.

314
00:23:25,348 --> 00:23:27,309
You can take it back
with you.

315
00:23:27,351 --> 00:23:29,477
It was just the belt,
so it should be all right now.

316
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:31,479
Thank you.
How much do I owe you?

317
00:23:31,521 --> 00:23:33,023
Oh, you're fine there;
it's free.

318
00:23:33,065 --> 00:23:35,150
Nothing's for free.
How much?

319
00:23:37,277 --> 00:23:39,112
Say four euro, love.

320
00:23:41,782 --> 00:23:44,618
Okay. We're going
to head upstairs, Dad.

321
00:23:44,701 --> 00:23:46,829
Is there anything
else you need?

322
00:23:46,913 --> 00:23:48,205
No, I'm grand.

323
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:49,581
Okay.

324
00:23:49,665 --> 00:23:51,541
A pleasure to meet you, sir.

325
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,294
And you.

326
00:23:53,377 --> 00:23:54,546
Take care.

327
00:23:54,629 --> 00:23:56,214
Good.

328
00:24:04,847 --> 00:24:06,348
Come on in.

329
00:24:13,148 --> 00:24:15,150
There you are.

330
00:24:34,378 --> 00:24:35,879
Wow.

331
00:24:35,962 --> 00:24:39,509
Can you transfer this stuff onto
disc for me so I can listen?

332
00:24:39,592 --> 00:24:41,552
Yeah.

333
00:24:41,636 --> 00:24:42,887
I have to go now.

334
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:46,057
Do you want to stay?

335
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:48,226
What do you mean?

336
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:50,477
Stay the night?

337
00:24:50,561 --> 00:24:52,856
What?

338
00:24:56,276 --> 00:24:57,902
Fuck this.

339
00:24:57,944 --> 00:24:59,613
Thanks for the Hoover, yeah?

340
00:24:59,697 --> 00:25:01,198
- See you.
- See you around.

341
00:25:05,494 --> 00:25:07,246
Fuck.

342
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:13,211
Flowers? Flowers?

343
00:25:19,341 --> 00:25:21,178
- Hey.
- Hey.

344
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:23,263
How's it going?

345
00:25:23,346 --> 00:25:25,056
Hey, where you going?

346
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:27,976
I wanted to give you the CDs
that I made for you.

347
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:31,771
I'm really...
I'm just really lonely,

348
00:25:31,813 --> 00:25:33,439
and you're gorgeous,
and I just...

349
00:25:33,522 --> 00:25:35,484
I'm sorry. I fucked up.
I'm sorry. I...

350
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:38,278
I don't know what to say.

351
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,863
It won't happen again.

352
00:25:46,328 --> 00:25:48,329
Do you have a CD player?

353
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:49,999
Yeah.

354
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:52,627
Here you go.

355
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:55,797
Batteries are pretty low,
but it should work.

356
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,840
I give it back.

357
00:25:57,924 --> 00:25:59,508
No problem. Keep it.

358
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:02,136
I have to go now.

359
00:26:02,219 --> 00:26:03,846
I'll talk
to you later.

360
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,141
You don't want to get a cup of
tea or something? I'd love to...

361
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:07,851
just talk to you
a bit more.

362
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:10,354
I have responsibilities.
I have to go home.

363
00:26:10,437 --> 00:26:12,898
Is it okay to walk along
with you then?

364
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:14,315
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

365
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:16,859
Cool. Cool.
So how was it today?

366
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:18,988
Selling good.

367
00:26:19,071 --> 00:26:20,864
And today is a really good day
for me

368
00:26:20,948 --> 00:26:24,744
because I got a job
in a big house, cleaning.

369
00:26:24,827 --> 00:26:28,413
This lady is going to pay me
some money, so I'm very happy.

370
00:26:28,497 --> 00:26:30,582
That's brilliant.
I'm delighted.

371
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,220
This is where I live.

372
00:26:42,303 --> 00:26:45,597
Oh, yeah? Cool.

373
00:26:45,681 --> 00:26:47,518
All right, then.

374
00:26:47,601 --> 00:26:49,227
Do you want to come in?

375
00:26:49,311 --> 00:26:53,524
Can I? Yeah. Cool.

376
00:26:53,565 --> 00:26:55,150
Hi, guys.

377
00:26:55,233 --> 00:26:56,276
Hello.

378
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,277
How are you today?

379
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,444
Not bad, not bad.

380
00:26:58,528 --> 00:26:59,821
How is work?

381
00:26:59,904 --> 00:27:01,448
It's great.

382
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:03,617
See you later.

383
00:27:42,407 --> 00:27:43,867
Ah, hi.

384
00:27:46,204 --> 00:27:48,122
This is my friend.
This is my mother.

385
00:27:48,164 --> 00:27:50,249
How are you?

386
00:27:50,332 --> 00:27:52,335
Nice to meet you.
How's it going?

387
00:27:56,046 --> 00:27:59,801
This is my
daughter Ivonka.

388
00:27:59,885 --> 00:28:02,595
Come on.

389
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:04,889
Hello, Ivonka. Hello.

390
00:28:17,194 --> 00:28:19,154
Sorry?

391
00:28:19,195 --> 00:28:21,740
That's dinner. Do you
want to stay for dinner?

392
00:28:21,824 --> 00:28:23,325
Yeah. Thank you.

393
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,048
Want to sit down?

394
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:38,299
Yeah.

395
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,660
Well, what did she say?

396
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,328
She says you're handsome.

397
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,662
She what?

398
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,331
Says you're handsome.

399
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,874
How do I say thanks?

400
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:17,089
Says, "You're welcome. "

401
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:18,841
Cool. Thanks.

402
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:20,218
Try to speak a little English, Mama.

403
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:21,886
No, thank you.

404
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,348
Careful.

405
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,808
Careful, Ivonka.
Don't do that.

406
00:29:26,892 --> 00:29:28,393
She's grand.
She's grand.

407
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:32,314
Where's her dad?

408
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:34,858
He doesn't live here.

409
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:37,527
Why not?

410
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:41,240
He's at home.

411
00:29:48,205 --> 00:29:50,123
Hello. Hi.

412
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:51,625
These are
from next door.

413
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,961
They come in
to watch telly.

414
00:29:54,044 --> 00:29:55,839
- Yeah.
- Hi, guys.

415
00:29:55,922 --> 00:29:57,382
There's only one
telly in the building.

416
00:29:57,465 --> 00:29:59,091
We watch Fair City together.

417
00:29:59,175 --> 00:30:00,802
Fair City, we love.

418
00:30:00,885 --> 00:30:03,638
We learn English
from Fair City.

419
00:30:03,721 --> 00:30:05,473
Are you not pregnant?

420
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:09,645
How are you, man?

421
00:30:09,728 --> 00:30:11,730
What is the hurry?

422
00:30:23,785 --> 00:30:25,494
Just put her in there.

423
00:30:25,578 --> 00:30:26,870
Okay.

424
00:30:28,622 --> 00:30:30,166
There you go, dearie.

425
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:35,420
Okay.

426
00:30:35,504 --> 00:30:37,131
She likes you.

427
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:13,878
You have no lyrics
for this one?

428
00:31:13,961 --> 00:31:16,338
It's really good.
I like it.

429
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,843
I've got a few,
but they're not right.

430
00:31:22,304 --> 00:31:23,805
Huh?

431
00:31:25,515 --> 00:31:28,935
I've got a few,
but they're not right.

432
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:31,479
What? Do you like it?

433
00:31:31,562 --> 00:31:32,813
It's great.

434
00:31:32,897 --> 00:31:36,777
Would you be into trying...
trying to write lyrics for it?

435
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,528
Really? I could?

436
00:31:38,612 --> 00:31:40,030
Yeah. Do you
like that idea?

437
00:31:40,071 --> 00:31:41,824
- Yeah.
- Cool. Cool.

438
00:31:41,907 --> 00:31:43,033
That would be good.

439
00:31:43,117 --> 00:31:44,826
I can keep machine
and write it?

440
00:31:44,868 --> 00:31:47,162
Yeah. Do. I was having
a bit of trouble with it.

441
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:49,206
It's too romantic for me.

442
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:50,833
It is romantic.

443
00:31:50,917 --> 00:31:52,752
You have a
romantic streak.

444
00:31:52,835 --> 00:31:55,880
I used to have
a romantic streak.

445
00:31:55,964 --> 00:31:57,673
When?

446
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,760
When I was your age,
I suppose.

447
00:32:01,844 --> 00:32:03,763
I see. You're
an old man now.

448
00:32:03,846 --> 00:32:05,348
Yeah. Dying.

449
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,352
Cynical.

450
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,400
You have to go now.

451
00:32:15,441 --> 00:32:18,111
Thanks for the Hoover
and food and songs.

452
00:32:18,195 --> 00:32:19,697
No problem.

453
00:32:24,201 --> 00:32:26,161
Thanks for the company.

454
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:27,830
I needed it.

455
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:29,206
Me, too.

456
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,878
You don't want
to go for late coffee

457
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,546
or a walk or something? No?

458
00:32:35,588 --> 00:32:37,298
I can't. See you.

459
00:32:37,381 --> 00:32:38,883
Bye.

460
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:40,635
See you.

461
00:33:17,007 --> 00:33:18,591
Fuck you, batteries.

462
00:33:35,775 --> 00:33:37,903
Jesus.

463
00:33:45,244 --> 00:33:48,122
I'll pay you back.

464
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:52,543
Come on.

465
00:34:05,014 --> 00:34:08,142
Are you really here

466
00:34:08,184 --> 00:34:12,146
Or am I dreaming?

467
00:34:12,188 --> 00:34:17,736
I can't tell dream
from truth

468
00:34:17,819 --> 00:34:20,823
For it's been so long

469
00:34:20,906 --> 00:34:24,659
Since I have seen you

470
00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:30,666
I can hardly remember
your face anymore

471
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:37,339
When I get pretty lonely

472
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:43,180
And the distance
causes only silence

473
00:34:43,263 --> 00:34:49,811
I think of you smiling

474
00:34:49,895 --> 00:34:53,523
With pride in your eyes

475
00:34:53,564 --> 00:34:57,028
Lover that sighs

476
00:34:57,111 --> 00:35:02,908
If you want me

477
00:35:02,992 --> 00:35:09,414
Satisfy me

478
00:35:09,456 --> 00:35:15,671
If you want me

479
00:35:15,754 --> 00:35:22,219
Satisfy me

480
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:31,437
Are you really sure
that you believe me

481
00:35:31,522 --> 00:35:37,110
When others say I lie?

482
00:35:37,193 --> 00:35:44,117
I wonder if you could
ever despise me

483
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:49,832
When you know I really tried

484
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:53,252
To be a better one

485
00:35:53,335 --> 00:35:56,798
To satisfy you

486
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:02,595
For you're everything to me

487
00:36:02,637 --> 00:36:09,353
And I'll do what you ask me

488
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:16,318
If you let me be free

489
00:36:16,401 --> 00:36:22,324
If you want me

490
00:36:22,407 --> 00:36:28,830
Satisfy me

491
00:36:28,872 --> 00:36:35,170
If you want me

492
00:36:35,253 --> 00:36:41,969
Satisfy me

493
00:36:54,358 --> 00:37:00,572
If you want me

494
00:37:00,656 --> 00:37:06,829
Satisfy me

495
00:37:06,871 --> 00:37:13,294
If you want me

496
00:37:13,377 --> 00:37:19,467
Satisfy me

497
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,557
Escalated

498
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:12,105
Little cracks they escalated

499
00:38:13,231 --> 00:38:19,697
From back inside comes

500
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:23,909
Lies, lies

501
00:38:23,992 --> 00:38:28,205
Breaking...

502
00:38:28,288 --> 00:38:30,415
When will...

503
00:38:30,457 --> 00:38:33,253
When will you learn?

504
00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:44,638
I think it's time
we give it up

505
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:51,271
And figure out
what's stopping us

506
00:38:51,312 --> 00:38:58,069
From breathing easy

507
00:38:58,152 --> 00:39:05,369
And talking straight

508
00:39:05,452 --> 00:39:12,084
The way is clear
if you're ready now

509
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:19,800
The volunteer
is slowing down

510
00:39:19,884 --> 00:39:24,681
And taking time

511
00:39:24,764 --> 00:39:33,690
To save himself

512
00:39:33,732 --> 00:39:40,864
The little cracks,
they escalated

513
00:39:40,947 --> 00:39:47,037
Before we knew
it was too late

514
00:39:47,121 --> 00:39:54,503
For making circles

515
00:39:54,545 --> 00:40:00,844
And telling lies

516
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:07,517
You're moving
too fast for me

517
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:13,398
And I, I can't
keep up with you

518
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:20,239
Maybe if you
slowed down for me

519
00:40:20,322 --> 00:40:25,535
I could see
you're only telling

520
00:40:25,618 --> 00:40:31,459
Lies, lies, lies

521
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:37,214
Breaking us down with your

522
00:40:37,298 --> 00:40:42,929
Lies, lies, lies

523
00:40:43,013 --> 00:40:48,769
When will you learn?

524
00:41:13,294 --> 00:41:19,175
The little cracks,
they escalated

525
00:41:19,258 --> 00:41:25,640
Before we knew
it was too late

526
00:41:25,681 --> 00:41:32,606
For making circles

527
00:41:32,689 --> 00:41:40,281
And telling lies

528
00:41:40,323 --> 00:41:45,118
You're moving
too fast for me

529
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:50,874
And I, I can't keep up with you

530
00:41:50,957 --> 00:41:57,048
Maybe if you'd
slow down for me

531
00:41:57,131 --> 00:42:02,804
I could see
you're only telling

532
00:42:02,845 --> 00:42:08,059
Lies, lies, lies

533
00:42:08,142 --> 00:42:13,856
Breaking us down with your

534
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:19,988
Lies, lies, lies

535
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:26,662
When will you learn?

536
00:42:29,165 --> 00:42:32,293
So plant the thought

537
00:42:41,928 --> 00:42:43,471
Would you like to buy a flower?

538
00:42:43,555 --> 00:42:45,140
- Hi. How are you?
- How's it going?

539
00:42:45,223 --> 00:42:46,432
Pretty good.

540
00:42:46,516 --> 00:42:48,351
- Pretty good.
- Good to see you.

541
00:42:48,434 --> 00:42:50,854
I'm going to go to
London, I've decided.

542
00:42:50,895 --> 00:42:51,938
- Good.
- Yeah.

543
00:42:52,021 --> 00:42:52,981
That's great.

544
00:42:53,065 --> 00:42:54,524
Yeah, it's good,
it makes sense.

545
00:42:54,566 --> 00:42:56,318
Well done.

546
00:42:56,401 --> 00:42:57,987
When are you going?

547
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:00,155
I'm going
to go Monday.

548
00:43:00,238 --> 00:43:02,490
Wow, that's, that's soon.

549
00:43:02,574 --> 00:43:05,077
You'll get
your girlfriend back,

550
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,121
and you'll get
your record deal, and...

551
00:43:07,205 --> 00:43:10,165
- become famous.
- Yeah, right.

552
00:43:10,249 --> 00:43:11,500
- Good.
- But listen,

553
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:13,169
I was thinking, I was
thinking before I go,

554
00:43:13,252 --> 00:43:15,212
I want to make a recording
of a few songs.

555
00:43:15,254 --> 00:43:16,755
A couple of the songs
I was playing you,

556
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:19,257
and I really liked the way
you played and your singing.

557
00:43:19,341 --> 00:43:21,845
So, if you feel like, would
you be into playing along?

558
00:43:21,928 --> 00:43:23,221
Like what we
were playing on?

559
00:43:23,304 --> 00:43:25,181
- I would sing and play?
- Yeah.

560
00:43:25,264 --> 00:43:26,641
I'd love that.

561
00:43:26,725 --> 00:43:28,059
Really? Cool.

562
00:43:28,101 --> 00:43:30,478
- So you'd be in my band for a few days.
- Yeah.

563
00:43:30,561 --> 00:43:34,691
Well, that's the first thing
I've got sorted out.

564
00:43:34,774 --> 00:43:36,443
Now I just need to sort
everything else out.

565
00:43:36,527 --> 00:43:39,362
All right, guys, welcome.

566
00:43:41,157 --> 00:43:43,242
Now, so let me
give you the tour.

567
00:43:43,283 --> 00:43:45,785
That is your
live rooms in there.

568
00:43:45,827 --> 00:43:47,412
This is a new desk.

569
00:43:47,453 --> 00:43:50,458
You got your hard drive and
you got your outboard gear.

570
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,959
Now all in all,
we're talking about

571
00:43:52,043 --> 00:43:53,043
three grand
for a weekend of...

572
00:43:53,127 --> 00:43:54,169
- Three?
- Yeah.

573
00:43:54,253 --> 00:43:55,713
Three grand, that's pretty good.

574
00:43:55,797 --> 00:43:57,089
You must be crazy.

575
00:43:57,173 --> 00:43:58,299
$3,000.

576
00:43:58,382 --> 00:44:00,676
Well, have a look around.

577
00:44:00,759 --> 00:44:03,346
You've everything
you need.

578
00:44:03,429 --> 00:44:06,349
- What do you think, is it good?
- It's pretty good.

579
00:44:06,433 --> 00:44:08,851
We'll give you one.

580
00:44:10,645 --> 00:44:11,605
I'm sorry.

581
00:44:11,688 --> 00:44:13,022
Have you heard
this guy's songs?

582
00:44:13,106 --> 00:44:14,440
I haven't yet, no.

583
00:44:14,482 --> 00:44:15,483
He's great.

584
00:44:15,566 --> 00:44:16,567
Okay, but, uh,

585
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:18,654
listen, I can fill
this place in an hour.

586
00:44:22,074 --> 00:44:25,035
One and a half then,
that's my limit.

587
00:44:26,912 --> 00:44:28,747
We can talk about two.

588
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,373
We don't talk.

589
00:44:30,457 --> 00:44:31,709
We shake.

590
00:44:31,792 --> 00:44:32,961
We shake on two, yeah?

591
00:44:33,002 --> 00:44:34,837
Shake now?

592
00:44:34,921 --> 00:44:36,047
All right.

593
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:37,047
Two thousand.

594
00:44:37,131 --> 00:44:38,215
She drives a hard bargain.

595
00:44:38,298 --> 00:44:39,259
She's a tough cookie.

596
00:44:44,263 --> 00:44:46,849
So you like this shop?

597
00:44:46,933 --> 00:44:49,186
I buy all my clothes here.

598
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,187
It's good for me, you know?

599
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,855
Cheap.

600
00:44:52,939 --> 00:44:54,941
Nice fashions.

601
00:44:56,109 --> 00:44:57,068
Okay, you ready?

602
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:59,237
Yeah, I'm ready.

603
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,036
That's good. That will do.

604
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:07,997
Do you like it?

605
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,165
You're gorgeous.

606
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,916
All right, can we go?

607
00:45:37,236 --> 00:45:38,528
The quality is poor,

608
00:45:38,612 --> 00:45:41,698
but if we can get
a professional tape,

609
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:45,703
I'm, I'm satisfied that he
can secure a lucrative deal.

610
00:45:47,997 --> 00:45:50,165
You take it home, you,
you listen to it.

611
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,500
You play it to your boss.

612
00:45:51,584 --> 00:45:53,127
I'm sure you can
get him to approve.

613
00:45:55,504 --> 00:45:56,797
Can I show you something?

614
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,844
I want to be free

615
00:46:00,927 --> 00:46:02,428
I want to be me

616
00:46:02,512 --> 00:46:05,890
I want you to be you

617
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:35,379
Nice one, lads.

618
00:46:35,463 --> 00:46:36,422
How's it going?

619
00:46:36,505 --> 00:46:37,548
How's it going?
All right.

620
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:38,590
Good, how is it today?

621
00:46:38,674 --> 00:46:39,591
Is it slow?

622
00:46:39,675 --> 00:46:41,260
Have a look
there yourself.

623
00:46:41,344 --> 00:46:43,346
Is that it? Is that it?

624
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:44,514
That's it, that's it.

625
00:46:44,597 --> 00:46:45,932
That's how it's
going at the moment.

626
00:46:45,974 --> 00:46:47,141
Listen, I wanted
to ask you,

627
00:46:47,225 --> 00:46:48,769
as myself and herself
are making a tape...

628
00:46:48,852 --> 00:46:50,103
How's it going?
All right?

629
00:46:50,145 --> 00:46:52,480
Of a few songs down
at Samson's Studios,

630
00:46:52,563 --> 00:46:54,815
and I was just wondering, if
you were around next weekend,

631
00:46:54,899 --> 00:46:57,278
for, to, if you'd be
interested in doing it.

632
00:46:57,319 --> 00:46:58,278
A bit of recording?

633
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,279
Bit of recording, yeah?

634
00:46:59,321 --> 00:47:00,781
Yeah, doing Lizzy
stuff, or...?

635
00:47:00,822 --> 00:47:02,490
No, it's not Lizzy,
it's me own songs.

636
00:47:02,575 --> 00:47:03,701
We only do Lizzy.

637
00:47:03,784 --> 00:47:06,703
Really. It's one
of our things.

638
00:47:06,787 --> 00:47:10,624
That sort of stuff, is it, sort
of rocky Lizzy stuff or...?

639
00:47:10,707 --> 00:47:13,127
- No. No, it's not.
- Yeah,

640
00:47:13,169 --> 00:47:14,295
Singer-songwriter stuff?

641
00:47:14,378 --> 00:47:15,629
It's kind of singer-songwriter, yeah.

642
00:47:15,713 --> 00:47:17,132
- Kinda...
- Is it any good?

643
00:47:17,173 --> 00:47:18,132
- Uh...
- It's great.

644
00:47:18,174 --> 00:47:19,634
Is it?

645
00:47:19,675 --> 00:47:20,634
Well, look, like I said,

646
00:47:20,676 --> 00:47:21,969
I don't really know
much about them,

647
00:47:22,052 --> 00:47:23,137
but they seem
like nice people.

648
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,722
Yeah. I just have to
call my mother first.

649
00:47:24,806 --> 00:47:25,766
- Then we go.
- Cool.

650
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:26,850
Great, great.

651
00:47:48,872 --> 00:47:50,165
Okay, come on,
we can go.

652
00:47:50,207 --> 00:47:51,833
Cool.

653
00:48:08,851 --> 00:48:12,522
Food's ready! Everybody
get your plates ready!

654
00:48:19,404 --> 00:48:22,032
- Hello?
- Hi, how are you?

655
00:48:22,074 --> 00:48:24,326
Come on in, kids!
Take a seat!

656
00:48:39,342 --> 00:48:40,551
Everything all right
here, folks?

657
00:48:40,593 --> 00:48:42,011
Yeah, brilliant.

658
00:48:42,094 --> 00:48:43,137
Enjoying the party?

659
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,139
Yeah.

660
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:45,181
Great to see you here.

661
00:48:45,265 --> 00:48:46,682
Can you sing?

662
00:48:46,766 --> 00:48:48,100
If you can't sing,
you're out.

663
00:48:48,184 --> 00:48:53,023
There's one request
I'll ask of you

664
00:48:53,106 --> 00:48:58,362
When your liberty you gave

665
00:48:58,445 --> 00:49:03,158
Remember Mitchell far away

666
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:08,080
A convict bound in chains.

667
00:49:13,669 --> 00:49:19,634
...mine that once held
this heart of mine.

668
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:31,812
And I love her so

669
00:49:31,854 --> 00:49:37,110
I wouldn't trade her
for gold

670
00:49:39,112 --> 00:49:44,326
I'm walking on moonbeams

671
00:49:44,409 --> 00:49:49,957
I was born
with a silver spoon

672
00:49:51,876 --> 00:49:56,339
Hell, I'm gonna be me

673
00:49:56,422 --> 00:50:01,385
I'm gonna be free

674
00:50:03,554 --> 00:50:07,600
I'm walking on moonbeams

675
00:50:07,684 --> 00:50:13,773
Staring out to sea

676
00:50:15,733 --> 00:50:21,198
And if a door be closed

677
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:26,495
Then a row of homes
start building

678
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:34,379
And tear your curtains down

679
00:50:34,462 --> 00:50:41,594
For sunlight is like gold

680
00:50:42,595 --> 00:50:44,138
Hell, you better be you

681
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,066
Hey.

682
00:50:54,149 --> 00:50:56,192
What are you doing here?

683
00:50:56,276 --> 00:50:58,736
I just came out.
You want to go for a spin?

684
00:50:58,820 --> 00:50:59,987
That's your bike?

685
00:51:00,071 --> 00:51:01,156
It's me dad's.

686
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:02,867
He absolutely loves it,
but I've robbed it

687
00:51:02,908 --> 00:51:03,951
off him for the day.

688
00:51:04,034 --> 00:51:05,244
If he knew,
he'd kill me.

689
00:51:05,327 --> 00:51:07,830
Would he?

690
00:51:07,913 --> 00:51:09,832
So do you fancy a spin, no?

691
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:13,376
I'd love to,
but I have to go to work.

692
00:51:13,418 --> 00:51:15,421
That's cool.

693
00:51:15,462 --> 00:51:16,631
Another time, yeah?

694
00:51:16,714 --> 00:51:18,883
Just thought while I
had it, I'd drive over

695
00:51:18,966 --> 00:51:21,677
and see if you were
into going now.

696
00:51:23,554 --> 00:51:25,139
Could you have me back by lunch?

697
00:51:25,223 --> 00:51:27,308
Yeah, totally.

698
00:51:27,391 --> 00:51:29,060
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

699
00:51:29,143 --> 00:51:30,061
Fancy it?

700
00:51:30,144 --> 00:51:31,146
Great.

701
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:11,687
You're what?

702
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:12,897
You're married.

703
00:52:12,981 --> 00:52:14,566
Does it surprise you?

704
00:52:15,901 --> 00:52:17,569
Fuck's sake.

705
00:52:19,112 --> 00:52:21,698
Yeah.

706
00:52:21,782 --> 00:52:23,158
When?

707
00:52:23,241 --> 00:52:26,494
Two years ago, when I find out
I'm pregnant with Ivonka.

708
00:52:29,373 --> 00:52:32,376
So where is he?

709
00:52:32,459 --> 00:52:33,878
He's back in
Czech Republic.

710
00:52:33,961 --> 00:52:37,548
It's over now and, you know,
I come here on my own.

711
00:52:40,133 --> 00:52:41,260
Man.

712
00:52:44,597 --> 00:52:45,598
You all right?

713
00:52:57,945 --> 00:53:00,530
What's the Czech
for "ocean"?

714
00:53:00,614 --> 00:53:02,533
Ott-san.

715
00:53:02,616 --> 00:53:04,076
Pretty much the same.

716
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:05,744
Otsan.

717
00:53:08,204 --> 00:53:09,539
So what are
you gonna do?

718
00:53:12,418 --> 00:53:13,753
I don't know.

719
00:53:16,547 --> 00:53:20,176
There's such distance
between me and him.

720
00:53:20,217 --> 00:53:23,178
He's so much different
to me and so much older.

721
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:27,517
It doesn't really work.

722
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:29,519
I'm fine on my own, you know?

723
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,814
It's just, I don't want Ivonka
to grow up without a father.

724
00:53:39,237 --> 00:53:42,783
What's the Czech for...
"Do you love him?"

725
00:53:43,909 --> 00:53:47,204
Noor-esh-ho?

726
00:53:47,246 --> 00:53:48,872
So...

727
00:53:48,914 --> 00:53:50,540
Noor-esh-ho?

728
00:53:52,459 --> 00:53:53,919
Noor-ho-tebbe.

729
00:53:56,339 --> 00:53:57,215
What?

730
00:53:57,298 --> 00:53:58,841
Come on, let's go.

731
00:53:58,924 --> 00:54:00,050
What'd you say?

732
00:54:00,093 --> 00:54:02,887
- Tell me.
- You've got to teach me how to ride

733
00:54:02,929 --> 00:54:05,347
- the bike now, eh?
- No way.

734
00:54:05,431 --> 00:54:06,432
- Yeah.
- No.

735
00:54:06,515 --> 00:54:08,309
So come on, can I have a go?

736
00:54:08,392 --> 00:54:09,311
No.

737
00:54:09,394 --> 00:54:10,604
Please.

738
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:13,690
No, leave it alone, will you?

739
00:54:13,773 --> 00:54:15,901
But teach me how to
drive it, will you?

740
00:54:16,985 --> 00:54:17,902
Come on, just once.

741
00:54:17,986 --> 00:54:18,903
No, it's not mine.

742
00:54:18,987 --> 00:54:19,987
Me dad would go
fucking crazy.

743
00:54:20,071 --> 00:54:21,030
But he's not here now.

744
00:54:21,113 --> 00:54:22,032
Be careful, will you!

745
00:54:22,115 --> 00:54:23,492
Be careful,
for fuck's sake.

746
00:54:23,576 --> 00:54:24,827
Look, he's not
here now.

747
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:26,870
- Just teach me.
- Look, my dad. Look. No, no, no.

748
00:54:26,954 --> 00:54:27,913
- No?
- No.

749
00:54:27,954 --> 00:54:30,916
- Please?
- No.

750
00:54:30,958 --> 00:54:32,459
Me dad will go
bleedin' mental.

751
00:54:32,501 --> 00:54:34,002
He totally loves this thing.

752
00:54:34,086 --> 00:54:35,837
Yeah, but you drive it.

753
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,381
Yeah, he doesn't
know I have it.

754
00:54:37,464 --> 00:54:38,425
He doesn't?

755
00:54:38,466 --> 00:54:39,509
No.

756
00:54:39,592 --> 00:54:42,428
Well, then he won't
know I had it, too.

757
00:54:42,511 --> 00:54:45,848
No.
You can't have a go on it.

758
00:54:45,932 --> 00:54:46,849
Just once.

759
00:54:46,933 --> 00:54:47,850
No.

760
00:54:47,933 --> 00:54:51,187
- Turn it on for me.
- No.

761
00:54:51,271 --> 00:54:52,189
No.

762
00:54:52,272 --> 00:54:53,440
Come on, give
us the keys.

763
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:54,733
I'll do it myself.

764
00:54:54,816 --> 00:54:55,942
The key's in it.

765
00:55:06,537 --> 00:55:07,538
Thank you for the ride.

766
00:55:07,622 --> 00:55:08,581
I'll see you
tomorrow, yeah?

767
00:55:08,664 --> 00:55:10,124
- For rehearsals.
- Okay, yeah.

768
00:55:10,207 --> 00:55:11,124
Okay.

769
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:12,251
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

770
00:55:25,681 --> 00:55:30,353
Trying to pull myself away

771
00:55:34,566 --> 00:55:39,738
I'm caught in a pattern
and I can't escape

772
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:49,248
I'm trying
to pull myself away...

773
00:55:55,254 --> 00:56:00,342
Lately, when I get back,
there's this thing I know...

774
00:56:00,425 --> 00:56:05,140
Everything comes
to you, way to go

775
00:56:05,223 --> 00:56:10,353
Even a heart has
something to learn...

776
00:56:10,395 --> 00:56:12,397
Thanks, Dad.

777
00:56:14,107 --> 00:56:15,858
All right, guys,
this is Eamon.

778
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,402
He's going to
take care of you

779
00:56:17,485 --> 00:56:18,529
for the weekend.

780
00:56:18,612 --> 00:56:20,030
Eamon, this is everyone.

781
00:56:20,114 --> 00:56:21,156
Kit's set up.

782
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,034
Piano is waiting for you
in the live room.

783
00:56:24,076 --> 00:56:26,787
Tea and coffee in the kitchen
as you came in. Help yourselves.

784
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:28,330
You'll need plenty.

785
00:56:28,413 --> 00:56:29,956
And there is a nice
little burrito place

786
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,834
around the corner if you
want a snack, all right?

787
00:56:31,917 --> 00:56:32,835
Great.

788
00:56:32,919 --> 00:56:34,170
Okay, Eamon,
leave it to you.

789
00:56:34,253 --> 00:56:35,379
Good luck, everyone.

790
00:56:35,463 --> 00:56:38,048
Enjoy. And I might pop in
later, all right?

791
00:56:38,132 --> 00:56:39,842
- Cheers, man.
- Cheers, thanks.

792
00:56:39,926 --> 00:56:41,969
Okay, guys,
good to meet you.

793
00:56:42,053 --> 00:56:43,387
We've a few little
bits and pieces

794
00:56:43,429 --> 00:56:44,429
to set up.

795
00:56:44,471 --> 00:56:45,932
I want to check
the drums inside.

796
00:56:46,015 --> 00:56:48,393
We've already set up the kit.

797
00:56:48,477 --> 00:56:51,813
Yeah, I just want to, you know,
check them for sound.

798
00:56:51,896 --> 00:56:53,899
I checked them already; it's fine.

799
00:56:53,982 --> 00:56:57,819
Okay, we need to set up mics
on them for recording, yeah?

800
00:56:57,902 --> 00:56:59,612
Oh.

801
00:56:59,695 --> 00:57:01,072
Have you done much recording?

802
00:57:01,114 --> 00:57:02,825
- No. -
No. - No.

803
00:57:02,908 --> 00:57:05,244
- Right. Let's get cracking.
- Yeah.

804
00:57:33,315 --> 00:57:35,066
Yeah, no, I can't
do it now, love.

805
00:57:35,149 --> 00:57:36,401
I'm stuck here in the studio

806
00:57:36,485 --> 00:57:37,903
with this bunch
of fucking oddballs.

807
00:57:38,153 --> 00:57:41,197
Can you hang on a second?
Just one second.

808
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:44,326
Okay, are you ready to rock?

809
00:57:44,409 --> 00:57:45,286
Are we ready?

810
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:46,787
Yep. We're in tune.

811
00:57:48,997 --> 00:57:51,083
So Al and Timmy,
on the second verse, just...

812
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:53,210
this is pretty much
simple enough thing.

813
00:57:53,294 --> 00:57:54,795
It's in five-four,
and the second verse,

814
00:57:54,878 --> 00:57:56,838
I'll give you a nod
to come in there, yeah?

815
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,883
Is that all right? And you're in
from the top with me, yeah?

816
00:57:58,966 --> 00:58:00,843
And you know what you're doing.

817
00:58:02,386 --> 00:58:06,141
All right, then, so, uh...

818
00:58:06,224 --> 00:58:07,642
whenever you're ready, yeah.

819
00:58:14,983 --> 00:58:17,110
All right, later.

820
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:18,820
Okay, we're ready. Fire one.

821
00:58:18,903 --> 00:58:20,656
You sure you're ready?

822
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:24,117
Okay, listen now for
the click track, everybody.

823
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,618
And away we go.

824
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:30,499
This is track one,
take one, yeah.

825
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:33,543
All right, lads, here we go,
this is it, yeah.

826
00:58:51,354 --> 00:58:54,690
So

827
00:58:54,773 --> 00:58:59,363
If you want something

828
00:58:59,404 --> 00:59:03,200
And you call, call

829
00:59:03,242 --> 00:59:07,203
Then I'll come running

830
00:59:07,287 --> 00:59:10,040
To fight

831
00:59:10,082 --> 00:59:13,794
And I'll be at your door

832
00:59:14,962 --> 00:59:22,886
When there's nothing
worth running for

833
00:59:22,928 --> 00:59:26,975
When your mind's made up

834
00:59:27,058 --> 00:59:31,062
When your mind's
made up

835
00:59:31,145 --> 00:59:34,899
There's no point
trying to change it

836
00:59:34,941 --> 00:59:39,154
When your mind's made up

837
00:59:39,237 --> 00:59:42,699
When your mind's
made up

838
00:59:42,783 --> 00:59:47,121
There's no point
trying to stop it

839
00:59:47,204 --> 00:59:49,623
You see

840
00:59:49,706 --> 00:59:54,419
You're just like everyone

841
00:59:54,504 --> 00:59:58,299
When the shit falls

842
00:59:58,382 --> 01:00:03,888
All you want to do
is run away

843
01:00:06,181 --> 01:00:09,728
And hide all by yourself

844
01:00:09,811 --> 01:00:13,481
When you're far from me

845
01:00:13,564 --> 01:00:18,570
There's nothing else

846
01:00:18,653 --> 01:00:22,449
When your mind's made up

847
01:00:22,532 --> 01:00:26,245
When your mind's
made up

848
01:00:26,328 --> 01:00:30,166
There's no point trying
to change it

849
01:00:30,249 --> 01:00:34,211
When your mind's made up

850
01:00:34,294 --> 01:00:38,299
When your mind's
made up

851
01:00:38,383 --> 01:00:42,094
There's no point
even talking

852
01:00:42,178 --> 01:00:46,099
When your mind's made up

853
01:00:46,182 --> 01:00:50,102
When your mind's
made up

854
01:00:50,185 --> 01:00:53,982
There's no point
trying to fight it

855
01:00:54,024 --> 01:00:58,320
When your mind's

856
01:00:58,362 --> 01:01:06,411
Your mind's

857
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:10,457
Made

858
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:12,585
Up...

859
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:25,639
Ah

860
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:29,352
There's no point trying
to change it

861
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:37,402
When your

862
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:45,785
Oh

863
01:01:53,294 --> 01:02:02,260
Ooh, ooh

864
01:02:05,515 --> 01:02:11,187
So... if you ever
want something

865
01:02:13,022 --> 01:02:17,277
And you call, call

866
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:21,573
Then I'll come running.

867
01:02:28,872 --> 01:02:30,665
Okay.

868
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:32,501
Wow.

869
01:02:32,584 --> 01:02:34,086
That was nice.

870
01:02:35,463 --> 01:02:37,131
Did you write that?

871
01:02:37,214 --> 01:02:38,424
Yeah.

872
01:02:44,846 --> 01:02:50,019
You must have
fallen from the sky

873
01:02:50,103 --> 01:02:53,023
You must have shattered
in the runway

874
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:25,681
You need somewhere
to fall apart

875
01:03:30,353 --> 01:03:33,356
Someone to fall upon

876
01:03:40,029 --> 01:03:42,490
That fools the bulls

877
01:03:42,573 --> 01:03:44,534
The powdered hag

878
01:04:24,117 --> 01:04:27,162
Okay, what do you think?

879
01:04:27,245 --> 01:04:29,457
I think it's fucking weird.

880
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:33,126
There's a couple of little tech bits,
we can probably fix them,

881
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:36,547
but uh, you know, it's 4:00 in the morning,
so it's up to you guys.

882
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:40,050
Do you want to push through
or go for another one?

883
01:04:40,091 --> 01:04:42,721
I'd love to keep going
if everybody is into it.

884
01:04:42,762 --> 01:04:44,889
Can I have a cup of tea
or something first?

885
01:04:44,973 --> 01:04:46,682
Want a cup of tea?

886
01:04:46,766 --> 01:04:49,477
- You want to take ten or 15, yeah?
- Sure.

887
01:04:49,561 --> 01:04:50,979
I'll tweak what I can.

888
01:04:51,062 --> 01:04:52,480
You guys take ten.

889
01:04:52,563 --> 01:04:57,194
Guys, why do you think there
are no blonde priests?

890
01:04:57,277 --> 01:04:59,613
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

891
01:05:21,218 --> 01:05:22,511
This is great.

892
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:49,373
How's it going?

893
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:53,627
Good.

894
01:05:53,669 --> 01:05:55,880
I don't think we're supposed
to be here, though.

895
01:05:55,963 --> 01:05:58,424
Ah, it's all right.

896
01:05:58,507 --> 01:05:59,967
This is beautiful, isn't it?

897
01:06:00,051 --> 01:06:02,428
Yeah, it's a beautiful piano,
like a Baldwin.

898
01:06:02,511 --> 01:06:03,596
It's a perfect piano.

899
01:06:03,679 --> 01:06:04,972
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

900
01:06:05,055 --> 01:06:09,144
Play us one of your songs.

901
01:06:09,227 --> 01:06:12,981
Hmm... They're
all half-written and more ideas.

902
01:06:13,022 --> 01:06:15,025
Go on, I'd love to hear one.

903
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:18,987
Okay, I have one,

904
01:06:19,028 --> 01:06:22,616
but... it's not finished and I...

905
01:06:22,699 --> 01:06:23,909
I don't really...

906
01:06:23,993 --> 01:06:25,077
Just play it, I know.

907
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,828
Okay, but the lyrics
are very rough, okay?

908
01:06:26,912 --> 01:06:29,582
- It'll be great.
- Okay.

909
01:06:44,055 --> 01:06:49,893
Walking up the hill
tonight

910
01:06:49,977 --> 01:06:55,358
When you have closed
your eyes

911
01:06:58,779 --> 01:07:03,616
I wish I didn't have
to make

912
01:07:03,699 --> 01:07:09,164
All those mistakes
and be wise

913
01:07:12,668 --> 01:07:18,006
But please try
to be patient

914
01:07:18,089 --> 01:07:24,055
And know
that I'm still learning

915
01:07:27,350 --> 01:07:33,272
I'm sorry
that you have to see

916
01:07:33,355 --> 01:07:38,236
The strength inside me
burning

917
01:07:41,448 --> 01:07:47,578
And where are you,
my angel, now?

918
01:07:47,662 --> 01:07:54,419
Don't you see me crying?

919
01:07:55,838 --> 01:08:01,093
I know that you can't
do it all

920
01:08:01,134 --> 01:08:07,725
But you can't say
I'm not trying

921
01:08:09,770 --> 01:08:15,232
And I'm letting myself down

922
01:08:15,316 --> 01:08:22,115
By satisfying you

923
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:30,123
I really wish
that you could see

924
01:08:30,164 --> 01:08:32,167
I...

925
01:08:45,347 --> 01:08:47,851
You all right?

926
01:08:49,436 --> 01:08:50,812
Did you write that
for your husband?

927
01:08:50,853 --> 01:08:52,146
Yes, I did,

928
01:08:52,188 --> 01:08:53,690
and he didn't like it.

929
01:08:53,774 --> 01:08:55,358
What an idiot.

930
01:08:55,442 --> 01:08:57,443
Yeah, he's an idiot.

931
01:09:23,596 --> 01:09:26,932
Come on away to London with me.

932
01:09:27,016 --> 01:09:29,602
Come on, we'll write loads of
songs and live in a nice flat.

933
01:09:29,685 --> 01:09:31,229
You can bring Ivonka over,
it'll be brilliant.

934
01:09:31,313 --> 01:09:32,689
Come on.

935
01:09:32,731 --> 01:09:34,399
Yeah, we'll go to London

936
01:09:34,482 --> 01:09:36,610
and no one will ever
find us again.

937
01:09:36,693 --> 01:09:37,819
- No one.
- No one.

938
01:09:37,903 --> 01:09:39,237
We'll have a brilliant band.

939
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,364
We'll sell out all the places
and it'll be great.

940
01:09:41,447 --> 01:09:43,200
And we'll make
an album together?

941
01:09:43,283 --> 01:09:44,743
I'd love that, come on.

942
01:09:44,826 --> 01:09:46,203
Yeah, and, and I'll do

943
01:09:46,287 --> 01:09:47,329
the backing vocals on it?

944
01:09:47,413 --> 01:09:48,538
Yeah, and play
the piano.

945
01:09:48,622 --> 01:09:49,831
Mm-hmm.

946
01:09:49,915 --> 01:09:51,250
Come on, I'm serious.

947
01:09:51,333 --> 01:09:53,127
Can I bring my mother?

948
01:09:58,924 --> 01:10:01,928
Well, we should go back
to work.

949
01:10:04,346 --> 01:10:06,224
- Yeah.
- Okay.

950
01:10:26,077 --> 01:10:27,704
What day is it today?

951
01:10:29,331 --> 01:10:31,250
Monday.

952
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:34,420
I think it's time we did
the, uh, the car test.

953
01:10:34,503 --> 01:10:36,422
What's the car
test, Eamon?

954
01:10:36,505 --> 01:10:38,548
We've been listening
back on these, uh,

955
01:10:38,632 --> 01:10:40,091
big studio speakers.

956
01:10:40,175 --> 01:10:43,346
So it's time we had a go
on some shitty speakers.

957
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:44,514
So...

958
01:10:44,597 --> 01:10:45,681
All right, let's go.

959
01:10:45,765 --> 01:10:47,934
Let's go for a spin
and have a listen in me car.

960
01:10:48,018 --> 01:10:49,227
Great, man.

961
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:50,561
- Yeah.
- Go have a ride, yeah?

962
01:10:50,645 --> 01:10:52,563
Let's go.

963
01:10:52,647 --> 01:10:56,234
We'll clear this up later.

964
01:10:57,277 --> 01:11:01,739
Timmy!

965
01:11:01,823 --> 01:11:02,825
Come on.

966
01:11:02,908 --> 01:11:04,660
Beauty.

967
01:11:12,043 --> 01:11:13,586
Beauty.

968
01:11:14,628 --> 01:11:16,588
All right.

969
01:13:30,353 --> 01:13:31,687
There they are.

970
01:13:32,896 --> 01:13:33,982
Listen, man, fucking...

971
01:13:34,065 --> 01:13:35,400
- Well done.
- It sounds fucking brilliant.

972
01:13:35,442 --> 01:13:37,527
- Thanks a lot for your help.
- Lots of luck with those.

973
01:13:37,611 --> 01:13:38,945
- Nice one.
- I just pressed the buttons.

974
01:13:39,029 --> 01:13:40,029
It was great.

975
01:13:40,113 --> 01:13:41,281
Nice, man, thank you.

976
01:13:41,323 --> 01:13:43,241
- Cool.
- You two go and get some sleep.

977
01:13:43,283 --> 01:13:44,284
Right, nice one.

978
01:13:44,367 --> 01:13:46,369
- And thanks very, very much.
- See you.

979
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:55,254
So this is it.

980
01:13:55,338 --> 01:13:57,256
- Yeah.
- We did it.

981
01:13:57,298 --> 01:13:58,966
It sounds great.

982
01:13:59,049 --> 01:14:00,217
It does, doesn't it?

983
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,384
Could I have one?

984
01:14:01,468 --> 01:14:02,803
- Yeah, yeah, totally.
- Thank you.

985
01:14:02,887 --> 01:14:05,223
I've got to
go this way.

986
01:14:05,306 --> 01:14:07,225
Really.

987
01:14:07,308 --> 01:14:09,226
Where you going?

988
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:11,271
Home.

989
01:14:12,647 --> 01:14:13,814
You don't want
to come back?

990
01:14:13,856 --> 01:14:14,899
I'll make you breakfast.

991
01:14:14,982 --> 01:14:16,525
- We could listen to the CD, no?
- No.

992
01:14:16,608 --> 01:14:19,988
I have to go see Ivonka
and organize things.

993
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:21,239
So do you.

994
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:22,365
Yeah.

995
01:14:22,449 --> 01:14:23,867
You're leaving.

996
01:14:23,951 --> 01:14:25,869
To London.

997
01:14:25,953 --> 01:14:27,412
What do you have
to organize?

998
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:28,580
What's, what's that about?

999
01:14:28,663 --> 01:14:31,542
I, I spoke to my
husband last night.

1000
01:14:31,625 --> 01:14:32,834
He's coming over.

1001
01:14:32,877 --> 01:14:34,712
Ah, brilliant.
Fair play... That's great.

1002
01:14:34,795 --> 01:14:36,463
- I'm really happy for you.
- It's good. Yeah.

1003
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:38,675
We'll try to
make it work.

1004
01:14:38,758 --> 01:14:40,009
It's for the best.

1005
01:14:40,092 --> 01:14:41,343
Yeah.

1006
01:14:41,385 --> 01:14:43,387
Come back and hang out,
have a cup of tea.

1007
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:44,846
It's the last day.
We'll hang out.

1008
01:14:44,888 --> 01:14:47,392
Whatever, breakfast, whatever.

1009
01:14:47,476 --> 01:14:48,560
Listen to the tunes.

1010
01:14:48,643 --> 01:14:50,520
Or you can come over later,
whatever.

1011
01:14:50,603 --> 01:14:52,605
For what?

1012
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:54,357
What do you mean, what?

1013
01:14:54,441 --> 01:14:56,401
Just hang, just come
and hang out.

1014
01:14:56,484 --> 01:14:58,027
But we done our work.

1015
01:14:58,110 --> 01:14:59,361
Why would I go over?

1016
01:14:59,445 --> 01:15:01,364
We'd just hanky panky
if I come now.

1017
01:15:03,408 --> 01:15:04,868
What?

1018
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:06,077
Hanky panky?

1019
01:15:07,663 --> 01:15:09,373
It won't be for hanky panky.

1020
01:15:09,414 --> 01:15:10,791
I know it would.

1021
01:15:13,418 --> 01:15:16,214
And that would be nice.

1022
01:15:16,256 --> 01:15:17,423
Would it?

1023
01:15:17,507 --> 01:15:19,633
- Hanky... Would it?
- Very interesting.

1024
01:15:19,717 --> 01:15:22,679
Be worthless though.

1025
01:15:26,015 --> 01:15:28,976
Come back later.

1026
01:15:31,021 --> 01:15:33,022
Mmm.

1027
01:15:36,818 --> 01:15:38,653
Okay, I'll come.

1028
01:15:38,737 --> 01:15:40,029
Yeah?

1029
01:15:40,113 --> 01:15:41,280
I'll come later, yeah.

1030
01:15:41,364 --> 01:15:42,740
Brilliant.

1031
01:15:42,823 --> 01:15:43,909
You sure?

1032
01:15:43,992 --> 01:15:45,286
Brilliant.

1033
01:15:45,369 --> 01:15:46,412
All right, then...

1034
01:15:46,495 --> 01:15:48,413
Cool. See you after.
Well done.

1035
01:15:48,455 --> 01:15:50,458
You, too.

1036
01:17:10,957 --> 01:17:12,960
Well, what do you think?

1037
01:17:16,964 --> 01:17:19,091
You like it?

1038
01:17:19,175 --> 01:17:21,510
It's just a demo,
you know...

1039
01:17:21,552 --> 01:17:22,969
It's fucking brilliant.

1040
01:17:23,053 --> 01:17:24,221
Really?

1041
01:17:24,305 --> 01:17:26,224
Fantastic stuff.

1042
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:29,268
That'll be a hit, no question.

1043
01:17:29,352 --> 01:17:31,813
When are you off?

1044
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:33,856
What?

1045
01:17:33,898 --> 01:17:36,567
Well, I've a few hundred quid
for you

1046
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:39,112
for a deposit on a place.

1047
01:17:39,195 --> 01:17:41,156
Going to come over
and see you

1048
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,908
when you're settled in.

1049
01:17:44,492 --> 01:17:46,829
When do you think
you'll be able to go?

1050
01:17:48,538 --> 01:17:50,457
I'm going tomorrow, Dad.

1051
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,458
Good man.

1052
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:54,211
About time.

1053
01:17:58,215 --> 01:18:00,134
Will you be all right?

1054
01:18:00,218 --> 01:18:02,178
What do you mean?

1055
01:18:04,138 --> 01:18:07,308
I was all right for years
before you came along, wasn't I?

1056
01:18:08,476 --> 01:18:10,770
I don't have to go now.
I can put this thing off

1057
01:18:10,854 --> 01:18:12,605
- for a few months.
- Go.

1058
01:18:12,689 --> 01:18:14,190
And the best

1059
01:18:14,274 --> 01:18:15,942
of luck, son.

1060
01:18:16,026 --> 01:18:17,569
Thanks, Dad.

1061
01:18:17,652 --> 01:18:20,780
Make your ma proud.

1062
01:18:23,951 --> 01:18:25,911
Now play it again.

1063
01:18:25,953 --> 01:18:29,206
Okay.

1064
01:18:29,456 --> 01:18:30,416
That's good.

1065
01:18:30,499 --> 01:18:32,000
Yeah. I recorded a few songs.

1066
01:18:32,084 --> 01:18:34,252
Oh, yeah? What are they like?

1067
01:18:34,294 --> 01:18:35,837
They're good.
I'm happy with them.

1068
01:18:35,921 --> 01:18:38,633
Great.

1069
01:18:38,716 --> 01:18:40,718
I've missed you.

1070
01:18:40,801 --> 01:18:42,970
Yeah, me, too.

1071
01:18:43,053 --> 01:18:45,556
Do you want me
to meet you at the airport?

1072
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,224
No. I'll come find you.

1073
01:18:48,976 --> 01:18:50,978
I'm glad you've decided to come.

1074
01:18:54,107 --> 01:18:56,943
Listen, I'm going
to get cut off here, all right?

1075
01:18:56,984 --> 01:18:59,196
Money's running out.

1076
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:00,739
Hurry up.

1077
01:19:42,866 --> 01:19:44,034
How are you?

1078
01:19:44,117 --> 01:19:45,201
Hello, handsome.

1079
01:19:45,285 --> 01:19:46,494
- Ahoy.
- Ahoy.

1080
01:19:46,536 --> 01:19:48,080
Um, is-is herself in?

1081
01:19:48,163 --> 01:19:49,289
No, no.

1082
01:19:49,372 --> 01:19:50,666
Oh. Great.

1083
01:19:53,418 --> 01:19:55,463
You don't know
where she is, do you?

1084
01:19:55,546 --> 01:19:56,797
Uh, she's-she's working.

1085
01:19:56,839 --> 01:19:58,340
She coming back, uh, evening.

1086
01:19:58,382 --> 01:19:59,716
Oh, okay.

1087
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,801
Uh, will you tell her
I'm-I'm going away?

1088
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:05,223
Uh, will you tell
her I'll call her?

1089
01:20:05,306 --> 01:20:07,183
Uh... Sorry.

1090
01:20:07,225 --> 01:20:09,310
- No telephone here.
- You don't have a telephone?

1091
01:20:09,393 --> 01:20:10,562
No telephone here, no.

1092
01:20:10,645 --> 01:20:11,854
Damn.

1093
01:20:11,896 --> 01:20:13,689
Um, I'll write her, yeah?

1094
01:20:13,731 --> 01:20:15,774
Uh, you write her
a letter? Yeah?

1095
01:20:15,858 --> 01:20:18,194
Yeah, I'll write her
a letter, yeah, yeah.

1096
01:20:18,277 --> 01:20:19,363
You go?

1097
01:20:19,446 --> 01:20:20,739
- No.
- Yeah?

1098
01:20:20,822 --> 01:20:22,490
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay.

1099
01:20:22,574 --> 01:20:23,741
- Bye.
- See you, Ivonka.

1100
01:20:23,825 --> 01:20:25,160
- Bye.
- Oh.

1101
01:20:25,202 --> 01:20:27,078
- Ciao.
- I'm sorry...

1102
01:20:41,051 --> 01:20:43,011
Flowers?

1103
01:20:43,053 --> 01:20:45,347
Want to buy
the flowers?

1104
01:21:05,452 --> 01:21:08,247
- Hey.
- How's it going?

1105
01:21:08,288 --> 01:21:11,833
- Um, could I have a word with
you about something back here?
- Yeah, sure.

1106
01:25:16,088 --> 01:25:17,922
One, two, three.

1107
01:25:18,305 --> 01:26:18,275
