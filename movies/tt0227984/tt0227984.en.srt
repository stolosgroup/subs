00:14:58,372 --> 00:15:00,972
actually ask me where I learnt English.

163
00:15:01,072 --> 00:15:02,372
English? Fuck!

164
00:15:02,572 --> 00:15:04,572
Do you have a problem with America, Felix?

165
00:15:04,672 --> 00:15:10,472
Oh, yeah. I've got one great big, fat, swollen
fucker of a problem with America, twat!

166
00:15:10,572 --> 00:15:13,472
Listen to this. I'm in
fuckin' Florida, right?

167
00:15:14,772 --> 00:15:17,172
This Southern prat comes
up and he's like er...

168
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:21,672
"Hey, England's small. You must know
that John fuckin' Smith guy, right?"

169
00:15:21,772 --> 00:15:23,972
- Fuckin' Smith!

170
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:27,172
I'm like: Oh, yeah, yeah, mate,
that's right. John Smith.

171
00:15:27,272 --> 00:15:30,772
Yeah, I do know him
but he doesn't come from England, mate.

172
00:15:30,872 --> 00:15:32,872
No, he comes from fuckin'

173
00:15:33,072 --> 00:15:34,472
Pricksville, USA!

174
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:42,872
- You going to answer the fuckin' phone or what?
- It's just my wife.

175
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:48,272
Now, when Mr. McElroy joins us, I'd be pleased
if you kept your opinions to yourself.

176
00:15:48,372 --> 00:15:53,172
This particular Yank is not a travelling
salesman. He's a genius, hmm?

177
00:15:53,272 --> 00:15:55,272
Who is this cunt?

178
00:15:57,672 --> 00:16:03,072
So I said to Mr. Durant, I said, "Mr. Durant,
we go and meet this fuckin' Yank McElroy,

179
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:05,272
bring him to the deal and that's it."

180
00:16:05,372 --> 00:16:08,572
None of this fuckin'
conversation-and-coffee bollocks.

181
00:16:08,772 --> 00:16:11,272
None of this asking him
how the Tampa Bay 'Eers are doing.

182
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:13,072
No, I said, "Fuck him.

183
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,972
I bring him to the deal, I get my fuckin'
tickets and I'm off. That's it."

184
00:16:19,672 --> 00:16:21,972
- Take a left up here
- There's no time for this.

185
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:23,472
Take a fuckin' left!

186
00:16:38,472 --> 00:16:40,772
Felix! Felix, listen!

187
00:16:40,972 --> 00:16:42,972
This is a totally new chemical.

188
00:16:43,072 --> 00:16:46,072
Once we have the formula,
we could make this stuff in a kitchen.

189
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:47,572
We don't even need Durant.

190
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:49,972
Look. You see that?

191
00:16:53,072 --> 00:16:56,672
That's tomorrow. Blokes are shagging
their mothers-in-law to get a ticket

192
00:16:56,772 --> 00:16:58,672
and I'm getting two from Mr. Durant.

193
00:16:58,872 --> 00:17:01,972
So unless you can shite out
a couple of tickets on the spot,

194
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:04,072
I suggest you shut the fuck up.

195
00:17:04,172 --> 00:17:07,372
But this is a unique
window of opportunity for you.

196
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:10,872
- We are talking telephone numbers!
- Ah, enough. Take care of him.

197
00:17:10,972 --> 00:17:12,672
He's getting on my fuckn' tits

198
00:17:12,872 --> 00:17:14,472
We're going to be ate boss

199
00:17:14,572 --> 00:17:16,972
Fuck the Yank. Let him wait.

200
00:17:17,072 --> 00:17:20,772
When you walk...

201
00:17:21,372 --> 00:17:23,772
Through a storm

202
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:27,772
Hold your head up high

203
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:32,272
Glory, glory, Man United

204
00:17:32,472 --> 00:17:35,472
Glory, glory, Man United

205
00:17:35,572 --> 00:17:38,672
Glory, glory, Man United

206
00:17:38,872 --> 00:17:41,972
And the Reds go marching on, on, on!

207
00:17:43,672 --> 00:17:45,672
Boys and girls of Manchester!

208
00:17:47,772 --> 00:17:51,872
- Just popped over from er... Liverpool...
- Fuckin' wanker!

209
00:17:51,972 --> 00:17:54,272
..to invite you to a
game of footy tomorrow.

210
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:56,072
What the fuckin' hell's that, you twat?

211
00:17:56,172 --> 00:17:59,272
But I'm fuckin' fucked
if you pricks are going to win it.

212
00:18:01,172 --> 00:18:03,372
Come on, then, mate. Keep up the spirit.

213
00:18:06,872 --> 00:18:08,972
Someone get that fucking thing out!

214
00:18:09,072 --> 00:18:11,172
Young man, get off the bloody green!

215
00:18:20,672 --> 00:18:23,072
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Round the block.

216
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:24,572
Drive, quick!

217
00:18:34,472 --> 00:18:36,772
Let's go meet the Yankee Muppet.

218
00:18:38,272 --> 00:18:41,872
Where's Lawrence?
Where's he gone? We're late.

219
00:18:41,972 --> 00:18:44,672
- Well, he's...
- You left him at the pub. Twat!

220
00:18:44,772 --> 00:18:46,372
- But you said...
- Go back.

221
00:18:49,472 --> 00:18:51,372
Go back and get him.

222
00:19:02,072 --> 00:19:03,872
Look at this wanker.

223
00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:05,972
- Prick!
- Go on.

224
00:19:17,672 --> 00:19:20,572
Lawrence says, right, he's
going to be carrying...

225
00:19:21,972 --> 00:19:24,072
..a load of drugs, right?

226
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:26,572
We do him. Job done.

227
00:19:26,672 --> 00:19:28,172
OK?

228
00:19:28,372 --> 00:19:33,472
I'm not having some fuckin' nig-nog...
put us out of business, right?

229
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,572
Hey!

230
00:19:35,672 --> 00:19:38,072
Watch it! You're pissin'
on my fuckin' boots!

231
00:19:38,172 --> 00:19:39,972
- What about Felix DeSouza?
- Fuck him.

232
00:19:40,172 --> 00:19:41,172
He's a rabid dog.

233
00:19:41,372 --> 00:19:43,572
Is he? Well, fuck him!

234
00:19:44,672 --> 00:19:46,472
Fuck him! Leave it to me!

235
00:19:46,572 --> 00:19:49,372
I'll rip out his fuckin' liver.
One shot. Va-voom!

236
00:19:51,072 --> 00:19:53,072
Yeah? No problem.

237
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:56,172
No problem.

238
00:19:59,472 --> 00:20:00,772
Hey!

239
00:20:03,272 --> 00:20:06,272
Hey! Felix DeSouza.

240
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,172
Just the wanker I wanted to deal with.

241
00:20:08,272 --> 00:20:10,272
Deal with this.

242
00:20:16,472 --> 00:20:18,572
What a fuckin' day.

243
00:20:18,672 --> 00:20:21,072
Arthur. Come in, Arthur. Over.

244
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:25,372
Why don't you try the
big fat button, Arthur?

245
00:20:26,472 --> 00:20:27,772
Yes, sir.

246
00:20:27,872 --> 00:20:31,572
Now, we are looking for
a large black gentleman wearing a dress.

247
00:20:31,672 --> 00:20:34,772
That's what Lawrence said.
It should be easy. Over.

248
00:20:34,872 --> 00:20:37,972
Yeah, and we want Customs
to pull him over, right?

249
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:42,672
Wrong. We want Customs to let him through
and you follow him. Over.

250
00:20:42,772 --> 00:20:44,772
- Utter nutbag.
- Right. Over.

251
00:21:02,372 --> 00:21:04,272
What now?

252
00:21:04,372 --> 00:21:06,972
Follow them all. Over.

253
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:26,272
- Madam, if you'd like to come this way.
- No. I've got to go.

254
00:21:32,672 --> 00:21:33,872
Have you finished?

255
00:21:33,972 --> 00:21:37,572
Not quite miss
we need to look at your shoulder bag

256
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:52,672
Welcome to England.

257
00:21:52,872 --> 00:21:56,372
Actually, that makes me out to be a bit
of a liar, cos let's face it, pal,

258
00:21:56,472 --> 00:21:58,972
you're about as welcome
as a dose of the clap.

259
00:21:59,172 --> 00:22:00,772
But it's always nice to be nice.

260
00:22:00,872 --> 00:22:03,072
- Who the hell are you?
- Felix DeSouza.

261
00:22:03,172 --> 00:22:04,972
Mr. Durant sent me.

262
00:22:05,072 --> 00:22:07,672
- I asked for a chemist. Where's Lawrence?
- In the car.

263
00:22:07,772 --> 00:22:10,072
- He should be here.
- I should give a shit.

264
00:22:10,272 --> 00:22:12,272
To me, you're just a ticket to the game.

265
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,272
Where's the chemist?

266
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:25,072
Where's Lawrence?

267
00:22:26,772 --> 00:22:28,372
You heard him. Where's Lawrence?

268
00:22:30,072 --> 00:22:32,672
Put these in the truck.
Get Durant on the phone.

269
00:22:34,972 --> 00:22:37,872
Put these fucking sticks in the boot.

270
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:42,372
Aaah!

271
00:22:43,972 --> 00:22:45,672
- What's that?
- It's Lawrence.

272
00:22:45,772 --> 00:22:48,072
I can see it's fucking Lawrence.
What happened?

273
00:22:48,172 --> 00:22:50,372
- You told me to take care of him.
- Oh, shit.

274
00:22:50,472 --> 00:22:53,972
I meant to take care of him,
not fucking take care of him.

275
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,972
Shit.

276
00:22:57,272 --> 00:22:58,372
Shit.

277
00:23:00,572 --> 00:23:01,972
Shit!

278
00:23:02,072 --> 00:23:03,772
Shut the fucking thing, will you?

279
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:14,172
Fuck...

280
00:23:14,272 --> 00:23:17,072
Get Durant on the fucking phone,
right fucking now!

281
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:28,172
Where's my motherfucking chemist?!

282
00:23:28,272 --> 00:23:31,072
- Lawrence? He should be in the car.
- Should be?!

283
00:23:31,172 --> 00:23:32,972
What kind of fuck-up is this Durarnt?

284
00:23:33,072 --> 00:23:36,172
Look, we deal today, or I
go to the competition.

285
00:23:36,272 --> 00:23:38,172
Look, let me speak to DeSouza.

286
00:23:38,272 --> 00:23:39,972
DeSouza? DeSouza?

287
00:23:40,072 --> 00:23:43,072
Look, boss, it wasn't my fault.

288
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,972
Besides, he was fucking irritating.

289
00:23:45,072 --> 00:23:48,172
Right now, I couldn't give a gnat's chuff.
You twat!

290
00:23:48,272 --> 00:23:49,972
You just make sure McElroy gets here.

291
00:23:50,172 --> 00:23:52,272
Where's my fucking chemist?!

292
00:23:52,372 --> 00:23:55,172
- Think we need a new chemist Mr. Durarnt
- I know. I know.

293
00:23:55,272 --> 00:23:57,372
I can fucking hear him, can't I?

294
00:23:57,472 --> 00:23:59,672
Tell him I'm going to get a hold of er...

295
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,772
Pudsey Smith, OK?

296
00:24:01,972 --> 00:24:05,572
Yeah. I am not buying aspirin
for a fucking arm and a leg.

297
00:24:05,672 --> 00:24:07,272
He's getting Pudsey Smith.

298
00:24:07,372 --> 00:24:09,372
- Who?
- He's a deaf-mute.

299
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,272
Stall him. Just stall him.

300
00:24:11,372 --> 00:24:14,372
You keep that Yankee cunt happy. And alive.

301
00:24:14,472 --> 00:24:16,772
All right, boss. Yeah.

302
00:24:20,172 --> 00:24:22,572
Oh! You fucking twat!

303
00:24:26,172 --> 00:24:29,172
What's the plan, then? Freshen up?

304
00:24:29,272 --> 00:24:33,472
Massage? Maybe you fancy
a bucket of fried fucking chicken.

305
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,772
If I wanted cuisine, I'd
have gone to Paris.

306
00:24:35,872 --> 00:24:37,972
You can still go to France.
It's not too far.

307
00:24:38,072 --> 00:24:41,572
It's full of pricks and they hate
fucking Yanks too. Do you fancy a bite?

308
00:24:41,672 --> 00:24:43,872
Yeah. All right.

309
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:55,672
Hello, stranger!

310
00:24:58,272 --> 00:25:01,172
Said hello to lover boy yet?

311
00:25:01,272 --> 00:25:04,372
Iki, I'm in a hurry.

312
00:25:04,472 --> 00:25:06,872
Can we get on with it?

313
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:18,572
Ruger mini-14, 223 calibre.

314
00:25:18,672 --> 00:25:20,672
It comes in a fetching chrome.

315
00:25:22,572 --> 00:25:24,572
20 rounds per banana.

316
00:25:24,672 --> 00:25:29,072
Unless the elite and snazzy Iki special takes
your fancy, extending your capacity to 40.

317
00:25:29,172 --> 00:25:32,372
- We've got a Czechoslovakian...
- CZ 83, I'll take one.

318
00:25:32,472 --> 00:25:33,872
Oh...

319
00:25:34,072 --> 00:25:36,772
Well, that's young Felix's
weapon of choice, isn't it?

320
00:25:36,872 --> 00:25:38,972
Now, there's a trip down memory lane.

321
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:41,672
I'm partial to a bit of sentiment, me.

322
00:25:41,772 --> 00:25:44,572
I've heard things, you know. He misses you.

323
00:25:46,172 --> 00:25:47,672
So, what are you going to take?

324
00:25:47,872 --> 00:25:52,272
I'll take the Baretta, the CZ, an ankle
holster, add the mini-14 and I'm done.

325
00:25:52,372 --> 00:25:54,872
- I want to get in and out fast.
- Don't we all?

326
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:57,672
Does Durant still do his
deals at the Port Hotel?

327
00:25:57,772 --> 00:26:00,272
Silly lad. It'll be his
undoing, one of these days.

328
00:26:00,372 --> 00:26:03,772
But what do you expect from a fella
who gets his arse waxed every month?

329
00:26:03,872 --> 00:26:07,372
I forgot what a circus this place is.

330
00:26:07,472 --> 00:26:09,072
Funny, that.

331
00:26:09,172 --> 00:26:13,272
I never did much like the circus. All that
poking your head in a lion's mouth shite.

332
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:16,672
Bring on the horses!
Get 'em rogering the dancing girls!

333
00:26:16,772 --> 00:26:18,772
That's a circus.

334
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:21,472
These... and these

335
00:26:21,672 --> 00:26:23,272
are on the house.

336
00:26:25,072 --> 00:26:27,572
Welcome home,... Dawn.

337
00:26:37,872 --> 00:26:39,772
- There you go, mate.
- Thanks, mate.

338
00:26:39,872 --> 00:26:41,472
Ta.

339
00:26:49,672 --> 00:26:53,272
What the fuck did they do to this fish?
Batter it to death?

340
00:26:53,372 --> 00:26:55,572
Fish and chips. The national dish, mate.

341
00:26:55,672 --> 00:26:58,372
More like a national disaster.

Come on.

358
00:27:43,572 --> 00:27:45,572
So, er...

359
00:27:45,672 --> 00:27:48,372
How much are they paying you
to wear that skirt?

360
00:27:55,772 --> 00:27:57,772
Fag?

361
00:28:01,172 --> 00:28:03,172
No, motherfucker.

362
00:28:20,872 --> 00:28:23,672
Ah, Mr. McElroy!

363
00:28:23,772 --> 00:28:26,172
That's daring, but very dashing attire.

364
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:27,972
Let's stick to the business in hand.

365
00:28:28,772 --> 00:28:31,872
Hey, come on! Mr. McElroy's
a guest of ours.

366
00:28:34,272 --> 00:28:36,972
OK boys Guns on the table please

367
00:28:38,072 --> 00:28:39,072
Felix?

368
00:28:39,172 --> 00:28:41,572
I've delivered him. I'll
have my tickets and be off.

369
00:28:41,672 --> 00:28:43,272
OK. Put your gun on the table.

370
00:28:43,372 --> 00:28:47,172
- Fuck. The game's tomorrow.
- Put your fucking gun on the table, you gobshite!

371
00:28:48,772 --> 00:28:50,772
What?

372
00:28:50,872 --> 00:28:53,272
- So, who's the chemist?
- This is Pudsey Smith.

373
00:28:53,472 --> 00:28:55,572
A first-class man.
Qualified and everything.

374
00:28:56,872 --> 00:28:58,472
He can't talk. He's been shot.

375
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:10,072
Felix, have you shit your
pants, or something?

376
00:29:10,172 --> 00:29:12,172
Something doesn't feel right, Mr. Durant.

377
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:16,272
I know. You're making me nervous, for fuck's
sake! Sit on your hands, or something.

378
00:29:16,472 --> 00:29:19,072
OK, Mr. McElroy, the ball's in your court.

379
00:29:29,672 --> 00:29:32,972
McELROY: MDMA utilises serotonin

380
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:36,372
Opiates like heroin utilise dopamine

381
00:29:36,472 --> 00:29:40,072
Sort of like the same
sensation you get after sex.

382
00:29:40,172 --> 00:29:42,572
Amphetamines increase adrenaline

383
00:29:42,772 --> 00:29:47,872
and cocaine gets those synapses
in the brain firing really fast.

384
00:29:47,972 --> 00:29:52,172
My product is 51 times
stronger than cocaine.

385
00:29:52,472 --> 00:29:55,572
51 times more hallucinogenic than acid

386
00:29:55,672 --> 00:29:58,572
and 51 times more explosive than ecstasy.

387
00:29:59,772 --> 00:30:01,072
It's like a personal visit...

388
00:30:02,472 --> 00:30:04,072
..from God.

389
00:30:05,672 --> 00:30:07,072
It's that good?

390
00:30:09,472 --> 00:30:12,172
The dog's bollocks.

391
00:30:33,672 --> 00:30:35,972
Felix DeSouza.

392
00:30:36,072 --> 00:30:38,572
- I count ten.
- That's right.

393
00:30:38,772 --> 00:30:42,872
That's one million sterling,
or 1... 1.6 million dollars.

394
00:30:43,072 --> 00:30:45,172
But that ain't what we agreed on, is it?

395
00:30:45,272 --> 00:30:48,072
You're 18.4 million dollars shy.

396
00:30:48,272 --> 00:30:51,972
And I don't care how you cut it,
that's a whole lot shy.

397
00:30:52,072 --> 00:30:54,072
No...

398
00:30:54,172 --> 00:30:56,972
Mr. McElroy, what we have there
is a goodwill gesture.

399
00:30:57,172 --> 00:30:58,672
A deposit. A down payment.

400
00:30:58,772 --> 00:31:01,372
One and a half million's
not a bad start, is it?

401
00:31:01,472 --> 00:31:06,472
I need to do some research. I need to feed a
few thousand to the kids, get some feedback.

402
00:31:06,672 --> 00:31:09,872
You don't think I can allow you
to walk out of here with $20 million

403
00:31:09,972 --> 00:31:12,072
for a formula that only
exists in your head?

404
00:31:12,172 --> 00:31:14,772
And all I get is what?

405
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:16,872
An ointment for toe jam.

406
00:31:18,672 --> 00:31:20,672
Uh-huh?

407
00:31:21,872 --> 00:31:23,272
- Market research.
- Right.

408
00:31:23,372 --> 00:31:25,572
Profile customers, send out questionnaires.

409
00:31:30,172 --> 00:31:32,772
Get out the bloody way, Felix.

410
00:31:32,872 --> 00:31:38,472
I can dig that. But unless you've got what
we agreed on, what the fuck am I doing here?

411
00:31:38,572 --> 00:31:40,872
Give me a call when you're ready to deal.

412
00:31:40,972 --> 00:31:43,472
I fucking knew it.

413
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:48,072
Room service.

414
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:50,172
That old fuckin' chestnut.

415
00:31:51,472 --> 00:31:52,572
Aaargh!

416
00:31:53,772 --> 00:31:55,472
Hey hold it fellas!

417
00:31:55,572 --> 00:31:58,272
It's my sausage and flamin' mash!

418
00:31:58,372 --> 00:32:00,672
Ssh...

419
00:32:00,772 --> 00:32:03,872
Sorry, love. Sorry about that, pet.

420
00:32:04,072 --> 00:32:05,972
It's just that er...

421
00:32:06,072 --> 00:32:07,972
my dad ran off with a room service maid.

422
00:32:08,072 --> 00:32:10,572
Things have never really
been the same since.

423
00:32:11,772 --> 00:32:13,472
Bollocks.

424
00:32:19,572 --> 00:32:20,872
Now's not a good time.

425
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,872
- Change of plan
- What do you mean?

426
00:32:22,972 --> 00:32:24,572
I want McElroy kept alive.

427
00:32:24,672 --> 00:32:26,272
I don't do alive, I do dead.

428
00:32:26,372 --> 00:32:27,972
It's a matter of $20 million

429
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:29,772
in cash being vaporised,

430
00:32:29,972 --> 00:32:33,272
and it's a matter of a lot of anger
being directed at The Lizard man.

431
00:32:33,372 --> 00:32:34,972
You now do alive.

432
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:39,272
My future is inside McEroy's skull

433
00:32:39,372 --> 00:32:42,372
You waste anything
and everybody that gets near him.

434
00:32:42,572 --> 00:32:45,272
You waste them, not him.

435
00:32:45,472 --> 00:32:48,572
His mind belongs to The Lizard

436
00:32:48,672 --> 00:32:50,472
Shit.

437
00:32:57,172 --> 00:32:58,972
Fucking hell!

438
00:33:02,172 --> 00:33:04,172
Shit, shit, shit!

439
00:33:11,872 --> 00:33:13,472
Arsehole.

440
00:33:15,672 --> 00:33:18,272
Let go, you double-crosser.
Let go! They're mine!

441
00:33:18,772 --> 00:33:19,772
Oh!

442
00:33:32,072 --> 00:33:33,672
Oh, shit.

443
00:33:50,472 --> 00:33:52,272
Shit.

444
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,272
Ow! Shit!

445
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,972
I told you to get out of the way, Felix.

446
00:34:03,072 --> 00:34:05,072
- Fuck! I've been shot.
- Where?

447
00:34:05,172 --> 00:34:07,072
In the fucking arse!

448
00:34:07,272 --> 00:34:09,472
Man, it's just a flesh wound. Come on.

449
00:34:09,572 --> 00:34:13,172
Flesh wound? Is that supposed
to sound like a fuckin' good thing?

450
00:34:19,572 --> 00:34:21,872
Come on, dude.

451
00:34:24,172 --> 00:34:25,372
Oi, sooty.

452
00:34:25,572 --> 00:34:27,172
Sooty!

453
00:34:29,072 --> 00:34:30,472
Here. Take these.

454
00:34:42,172 --> 00:34:44,272
- Aaargh!
- Oh, fuck!

455
00:34:44,472 --> 00:34:46,872
Fuckin' get him, boys. Come on!

456
00:34:51,872 --> 00:34:55,572
- Stay down, bitch.
- Oi! You're not driving my car!

457
00:34:55,672 --> 00:34:56,872
Shit.

458
00:34:57,072 --> 00:34:58,872
Give me the fuckin' keys. Get in the car.

459
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,072
Fuck!

460
00:35:08,472 --> 00:35:10,272
Aaargh!

461
00:35:13,672 --> 00:35:14,972
Fucking hell!

462
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,672
Get your fat arse out of the flamin' car.
Check the hotel.

463
00:35:18,772 --> 00:35:21,572
Put me in the picture.
What the fuck happened back there?

464
00:35:21,772 --> 00:35:23,672
I just got shot in the fucking arse

465
00:35:23,772 --> 00:35:26,772
- is what happened!
- This is not how we do fuckin' business.

466
00:35:26,872 --> 00:35:29,472
- Just get out of the fucking car!
- All right. All right.

467
00:35:29,572 --> 00:35:30,572
Oh, fuck!

468
00:35:36,072 --> 00:35:38,372
What the fuck are you doing?

469
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:40,172
Woah...

470
00:35:41,872 --> 00:35:43,372
Just take a fucking left!

471
00:35:53,072 --> 00:35:54,772
- Get off the pavement!
- Shit.

472
00:35:54,872 --> 00:35:57,172
Watch out!

473
00:35:57,272 --> 00:35:59,272
Fuck!

474
00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:02,972
- Which fucking way?
- Right. Right.

475
00:36:08,372 --> 00:36:10,772
- Come on!
- Aargh. Christ!

476
00:36:11,872 --> 00:36:12,872
Hey

477
00:36:24,572 --> 00:36:26,972
- The traffic's coming from the right.
- I got it.

478
00:36:32,172 --> 00:36:33,872
Fuck!

479
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:40,072
You! Out of my fuckin' way!

480
00:36:49,872 --> 00:36:51,572
- Oh, bollocks.
- The dog's bollocks?

481
00:36:52,472 --> 00:36:53,972
No. Just plain fucking bollocks.

482
00:36:54,172 --> 00:36:55,572
- No dogs involved?
- No!

483
00:36:56,472 --> 00:36:58,172
Watch out! Watch out!

484
00:37:02,072 --> 00:37:03,672
You'll kill the fucking car!

485
00:37:09,272 --> 00:37:11,572
Fuck.

486
00:37:12,972 --> 00:37:14,872
Oh! Fuck.

487
00:37:22,772 --> 00:37:24,072
Hello?

488
00:37:37,072 --> 00:37:39,072
So, let me get this straight.

489
00:37:39,172 --> 00:37:42,472
"Bollocks" is bad,
whereas "the dog's bollocks" is good, huh?

490
00:37:42,672 --> 00:37:44,372
Yeah.

491
00:37:47,372 --> 00:37:48,872
Oh, bollocks.

492
00:37:55,672 --> 00:37:57,372
Gotcha.

493
00:38:09,772 --> 00:38:12,072
Come on, then!

494
00:38:12,172 --> 00:38:13,172
Come on!

495
00:38:14,472 --> 00:38:19,372
Aaa-aargh!

496
00:38:22,472 --> 00:38:25,372
- Stop.
- God. Fucking Yanks.

497
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:26,672
Come on!

498
00:38:32,072 --> 00:38:33,072
Shit.

499
00:38:33,272 --> 00:38:34,772
Fucking hell.

500
00:38:36,872 --> 00:38:38,872
Scraping my fucking paintwork!

501
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,272
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

502
00:38:42,372 --> 00:38:45,572
- Fuck you, Kane, you shitebag.
- Fuck off!

503
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:51,672
Oh, you little fuck!

504
00:38:51,772 --> 00:38:54,172
Chicken bollocks.

505
00:38:56,172 --> 00:38:57,672
Shit!

506
00:38:57,772 --> 00:38:59,772
Whoa-oa!

507
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:04,472
Fuck you, Kane, you fucking wanker!

508
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,472
Come here, you!

509
00:39:36,672 --> 00:39:38,272
- Are you all right?
- Fuck off!

510
00:39:41,572 --> 00:39:43,872
We've lost them.

511
00:39:48,372 --> 00:39:51,772
Yeah, well, let's not take any chances.

512
00:40:14,472 --> 00:40:15,472
Oh...

513
00:40:16,772 --> 00:40:19,072
Oh, shit!

514
00:40:35,872 --> 00:40:37,872
Ugh...

515
00:40:39,572 --> 00:40:41,272
Are you wanting to junk that, pal?

516
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:42,372
You what?

517
00:40:42,472 --> 00:40:45,272
Dude, do you have a car that works?
I need transportation.

518
00:40:45,472 --> 00:40:47,272
I've got a Cooper needing a lick of paint.

519
00:40:47,472 --> 00:40:51,072
She goes. Throw in the XJ6
and she's yours for a 100 quid.

520
00:40:51,172 --> 00:40:55,072
- Deal.
- What, a Cooper? Piss off, Popeye. And you.

521
00:40:55,272 --> 00:40:57,372
I'll tell you what 70, quid and the Jag

522
00:40:57,572 --> 00:40:59,172
and I'm robbing myself.

523
00:40:59,272 --> 00:41:01,872
Tha... that's it. That's it.

524
00:41:02,072 --> 00:41:04,772
I've had just about enough of this shite

525
00:41:04,872 --> 00:41:06,872
I got you to that deal in one piece.

526
00:41:06,972 --> 00:41:08,972
I got you out of that deal in one piece.

527
00:41:09,072 --> 00:41:12,172
As far as I'm concerned, my job's done.
It's finished.

528
00:41:12,372 --> 00:41:15,972
You can leave my motor alone, get your
golf clubs, and fuck off back to Dixie.

529
00:41:16,172 --> 00:41:18,572
Pay attention, Felix DeSouza.

530
00:41:18,772 --> 00:41:23,272
I atomised a major drugs syndicate
to be here this morning.

531
00:41:23,472 --> 00:41:28,072
Now, I'm stuck in
Liver-fucking-fool with you!

532
00:41:28,172 --> 00:41:34,372
And if I need you to sell your car to
help me, you will sell your goddamn car!

533
00:41:41,272 --> 00:41:43,472
Do I look like the Salvation Army?

534
00:41:43,572 --> 00:41:46,572
Have I got Jim'll Fix It
written on my fucking hat?

535
00:41:46,772 --> 00:41:50,372
I'm sorry, mate, but help's not a word
I'm too familiar with, you know.

536
00:41:57,072 --> 00:41:58,172
Fuck off!

537
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:22,372
I don't believe it.

538
00:42:24,272 --> 00:42:26,272
So, who's the girl?

539
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:31,672
It's my ex-girlfriend.

540
00:42:35,372 --> 00:42:38,872
Arthur. I want you to
describe the situation to me.

541
00:42:39,072 --> 00:42:42,372
Seven shades of shit in a
one-shit trumpet, sir.

542
00:42:42,472 --> 00:42:45,172
It looks like some kind of a drugs buy.

543
00:42:45,272 --> 00:42:46,872
None of your ordinary

544
00:42:47,072 --> 00:42:50,472
Aye aye. Got some blue tabs.
They look like sweets.

545
00:42:50,672 --> 00:42:52,672
How are you?

546
00:42:52,772 --> 00:42:55,972
What do you mean, how am I?
Nearly cut my fucking ear off!

547
00:42:56,072 --> 00:42:58,072
And I've hurt my knee.

548
00:42:58,172 --> 00:43:03,272
Now, I want you to get the pills and take
them straight down to the lab, double time.

549
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:07,272
You got that? And then you call me.
Now, what else have you got?

550
00:43:08,172 --> 00:43:09,672
Six dead bodies and one live one.

551
00:43:09,772 --> 00:43:12,272
Chief, it's Leopold Durant.

552
00:43:12,472 --> 00:43:15,772
Durant? Right. Now, concentrate, Arthur.

553
00:43:15,872 --> 00:43:19,772
Get that fat fuck down here pronto.

554
00:43:19,872 --> 00:43:21,372
But, sir, he's dying.

555
00:43:21,572 --> 00:43:24,572
Then you'd better be fucking
quick about it, hadn't you?

556
00:43:29,372 --> 00:43:31,372
She dumped me.

557
00:43:33,072 --> 00:43:35,072
Two years ago now.

558
00:43:37,172 --> 00:43:39,872
Changed her name from Dawn to Dakota.

559
00:43:39,972 --> 00:43:42,672
Fucked off for Las Vegas
and a deck of cards.

560
00:43:42,872 --> 00:43:45,072
So who hired her to take me out?

561
00:43:45,172 --> 00:43:47,472
You're asking the wrong question, mate.

562
00:43:49,272 --> 00:43:51,572
She's your guardian angel.

563
00:43:53,972 --> 00:43:56,572
If she wanted you dead you'd be dead

564
00:43:56,772 --> 00:43:58,772
She never misses.

565
00:43:58,872 --> 00:44:00,872
I mean, fucking look at that.

566
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:07,272
If she really wanted to hit me... I'd be
shiteing through a tube for the rest of my life.

567
00:44:09,872 --> 00:44:12,772
Someone wants you kept alive.

568
00:44:19,972 --> 00:44:24,372
Somebody's trying to cut in on
Durant's deal. They're shitting again.

569
00:44:24,472 --> 00:44:26,872
- Yeah, well, shit happens.
- No

570
00:44:26,972 --> 00:44:29,372
Shit don't just happen, shit takes time.

571
00:44:29,472 --> 00:44:31,472
Shit takes effort.

572
00:44:31,672 --> 00:44:33,772
$20 million-worth of effort.

573
00:44:36,472 --> 00:44:38,872
I've got to get a new deal on, fast.

574
00:44:39,072 --> 00:44:41,672
You know the town, you know the players.

575
00:44:41,772 --> 00:44:43,472
Look...

576
00:44:45,372 --> 00:44:47,372
..all I want is a ticket for the game.

577
00:44:47,472 --> 00:44:49,472
Do you think you can swing that?

578
00:44:49,572 --> 00:44:53,172
$20 million could swing anything.
You know what I'm selling.

579
00:44:53,272 --> 00:44:55,272
Well, how much?

580
00:44:55,372 --> 00:44:58,272
5% of whatever I get out
of any deal you set up.

581
00:44:58,372 --> 00:45:00,372
That's a million dollars.

582
00:45:00,472 --> 00:45:03,672
Hell, you could buy your own
goddamn stadium with that.

583
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:10,972
- Game's tomorrow.
- You'd better get started, then.

584
00:45:11,172 --> 00:45:13,172
Oh, and Felix.

585
00:45:13,272 --> 00:45:15,872
A word of advice.

586
00:45:15,972 --> 00:45:19,772
You ever want to get the girl,
you've got to broaden your horizons.

587
00:45:27,772 --> 00:45:29,772
What the fuck is that?

588
00:45:29,872 --> 00:45:31,872
What is it?

589
00:45:31,972 --> 00:45:33,972
What? Scotch mist?

590
00:45:35,572 --> 00:45:37,872
Now, now, now, now, now.

591
00:45:38,072 --> 00:45:40,672
You are getting greedy, Leopold.

592
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:47,772
It's a big deal going down, and you are
trying to cut me out of the fucking loop.

593
00:45:47,972 --> 00:45:52,672
I told you. Face the fuck front!

594
00:45:56,772 --> 00:45:58,472
This is going to cost you

595
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,172
an additional 15%.

596
00:46:01,272 --> 00:46:02,572
No?

597
00:46:02,772 --> 00:46:04,372
All right, then. 30.

598
00:46:04,472 --> 00:46:06,072
As you're being so difficult.

599
00:46:06,172 --> 00:46:10,872
How about this?
50-50. Why settle for anything less, eh?

600
00:46:12,972 --> 00:46:14,972
60-40.

601
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:21,672
Leopold, I don't know if you noticed, my son,
but you're in urgent need of a fucking doctor.

602
00:46:23,172 --> 00:46:25,172
50-50.

603
00:46:25,372 --> 00:46:27,172
Good boy.

604
00:46:28,572 --> 00:46:31,172
All right, then, Arthur. Take him down.

605
00:46:35,372 --> 00:46:37,072
Argh!

606
00:46:37,272 --> 00:46:39,372
Fuck!

607
00:46:41,772 --> 00:46:47,472
You really have excelled yourself this time,
haven't you, Arthur? Brilliant. Fucking brilliant.

608
00:46:49,372 --> 00:46:51,072
Eastern meditation music

609
00:46:59,672 --> 00:47:02,372
Omar, it's my own interpretation, innit?

610
00:47:02,472 --> 00:47:05,472
- You need to find your centre.
- Get off my leg!

611
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:08,072
- Find your centre.
- Stop messing... Omar!

612
00:47:09,172 --> 00:47:13,872
Omar, you're messing with
my delicate energy field here, all right?

613
00:47:14,072 --> 00:47:15,672
OK, OK.

614
00:47:16,872 --> 00:47:19,072
- Cocksucker.
- Find your centre, Omar.

615
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:22,872
Hello?

616
00:47:22,972 --> 00:47:25,272
You've got one chance, mate - yes or no -

617
00:47:25,372 --> 00:47:28,972
to be the number one shite
in this particular cesspool.

618
00:47:29,072 --> 00:47:33,472
Bugger me sideways. Felix DeSouza, you
misguided wanker. I'm already number one.

619
00:47:33,572 --> 00:47:35,972
Iki: Always was a bit of a pock
- Leo Durarnt

620
00:47:36,072 --> 00:47:37,972
- Now he's a dead pock
- Dead?

621
00:47:38,172 --> 00:47:41,172
Hang on, Felix. It's my other line.

622
00:47:43,272 --> 00:47:44,472
Hello?

623
00:47:44,572 --> 00:47:46,172
I need to find Felix.

624
00:47:46,272 --> 00:47:48,272
Hello, Dawn.

625
00:47:49,572 --> 00:47:51,572
Time to scratch that itch, is it?

626
00:47:51,672 --> 00:47:53,772
Well, he's gnawing my fucking wigwam.

627
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:57,572
- Where does he hang out these days?
- Hang on a minute, Dawn.

628
00:47:57,672 --> 00:47:58,672
Felix...

629
00:47:58,772 --> 00:48:00,772
Listen, me and er...

630
00:48:00,872 --> 00:48:03,572
My associate and I
have selected you to deal with.

631
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,372
Well, aren't I just the
luckiest bugger alive?

632
00:48:07,472 --> 00:48:09,872
- Stay there.
- I don't fucking believe it.

633
00:48:11,372 --> 00:48:14,672
- Have you tried Re-Fresh, Pink Factor?
- Yeah, all of them.

634
00:48:14,772 --> 00:48:17,472
Hang on a minute, tiger.
Just let me deal with this.

635
00:48:17,572 --> 00:48:19,572
Let me talk to him.

636
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:22,772
McELROY: The deal is $20 million

637
00:48:22,872 --> 00:48:26,472
The deal is non-negotiable.
The deal expires at midnight.

638
00:48:26,572 --> 00:48:31,372
Oh, Mr. McElroy, 20 million
sounds fannytastic. Yes!

639
00:48:32,572 --> 00:48:37,672
Negotiation's for arsewipes. If you're not
here by midnight, I'll shit myself with woe.

640
00:48:37,872 --> 00:48:40,472
I want samples, Mr. McElroy.
Supersonic samples.

641
00:48:40,572 --> 00:48:45,972
I want frost, I want 100,000 miles an hour
of intergalactic spaciness. See ya.

642
00:48:46,172 --> 00:48:48,172
We in the house.

643
00:48:50,072 --> 00:48:51,972
Iki: Hya Daw Sorry to keep you

644
00:48:52,172 --> 00:48:54,572
There might be one person
who knows where he is.

645
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:02,772
Fuck.

646
00:49:07,172 --> 00:49:08,772
What the fuck is that?

647
00:49:08,972 --> 00:49:12,372
Congratulations pal
That's your new Cooper

648
00:49:12,472 --> 00:49:14,472
Mini Cooper.

649
00:49:22,072 --> 00:49:24,472
Have I got to sort out
every fucking problem?

650
00:49:24,572 --> 00:49:27,272
A laboratory. Or as you
would say, a lab-oratree.

651
00:49:27,372 --> 00:49:29,372
We need a lab, Felix.

652
00:49:29,572 --> 00:49:34,172
I'm sure that's dead easy where you come
from. Fucking lab on every corner, is it?

653
00:49:47,772 --> 00:49:49,172
Piss off.

654
00:50:00,472 --> 00:50:02,072

00:50:24,872 --> 00:50:26,472
I need to find Felix.

663
00:50:26,572 --> 00:50:29,772
And what do you need from me?
A map and a fucking compass?

664
00:50:29,872 --> 00:50:31,872
Shirley...

665
00:50:31,972 --> 00:50:35,572
You broke his heart.
Did you even give a thought about that?

666
00:50:35,772 --> 00:50:38,872
- This was a mistake.
- Most sensible thing you've said.

667
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,872
Are you still shooting people for a living?

668
00:50:43,972 --> 00:50:47,072
What kind of fucking
career is that, then, eh?

669
00:50:50,072 --> 00:50:53,772
- Look, can I come in?
- And do what? The dirty stop-out

670
00:50:53,872 --> 00:50:55,972
doesn't come home till breakfast.

671
00:50:58,272 --> 00:51:00,672
Really good to be home.

672
00:51:06,172 --> 00:51:09,072

I wanted to see the world.

677
00:51:32,372 --> 00:51:34,372
Liverpool isn't the world.

678
00:51:35,972 --> 00:51:39,772
I couldn't take America.
It was like fucking Albania in neon.

679
00:51:39,872 --> 00:51:41,972
And that stupid football shirt.

680
00:51:43,872 --> 00:51:47,972
What kind of man jumps into bed shouting,
"Come on, you Reds"?

681
00:51:48,072 --> 00:51:50,272
She made me laugh.

682
00:51:54,172 --> 00:51:56,172
Good shag, though.

683
00:51:56,272 --> 00:51:59,672
I tell you, she'd kill anyone for me,
I'll say that for her.

684
00:51:59,772 --> 00:52:01,372
He's got problems.

685
00:52:01,472 --> 00:52:02,972
She's got problems.

686
00:52:03,072 --> 00:52:05,272
Shouldn't have come back.

687
00:52:05,472 --> 00:52:06,972
Better off.

688
00:52:14,872 --> 00:52:16,872
I need everything on this list.

689
00:52:17,072 --> 00:52:20,172
I'm dying for a smoke.
You haven't any ciggies, have you?

690
00:52:20,272 --> 00:52:22,972
I'm sorry. Cigarettes are
bad for your health.

691
00:52:23,072 --> 00:52:26,672
So's a fucking punch in the throat.
I need fucking nicotine now!

692
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:29,872
No need to shout at me.
I'm Pakistani, not deaf.

693
00:52:30,972 --> 00:52:34,572
- Take a puff on this!
- Oh, fuck off.

694
00:52:34,772 --> 00:52:36,172
You?

695
00:52:37,272 --> 00:52:41,672
You! Dress-wearing er... monkey-boy.

696
00:52:41,772 --> 00:52:44,072
Monkey-boy!

697
00:52:44,172 --> 00:52:47,672
You're going to take them drugs of yours
and make it work for us.

698
00:52:47,772 --> 00:52:52,072
- And where would I do this?
- In my lab.

699
00:52:52,272 --> 00:52:54,372
- You got a lab?
- Yeah, of course.

700
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:58,472
What do you take us for?
Rank fucking amateurs?

701
00:53:04,572 --> 00:53:06,572
Thrash metal

702
00:53:13,372 --> 00:53:14,872
Come on!

703
00:53:24,372 --> 00:53:26,372
Just say no.

704
00:53:26,572 --> 00:53:28,872
How the fuck did we end up in here?

705
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,972
One little mistake... 30 years ago.

706
00:53:42,172 --> 00:53:44,572
All of these items are over-the-counter.

707
00:53:44,772 --> 00:53:46,772
Nothing illegal here.

708
00:53:46,872 --> 00:53:48,872
You're no fucking help, are you?

709
00:53:48,972 --> 00:53:54,072
I beg to differ. You see, it's not the ingredients
themselves which determine the effect

710
00:53:54,172 --> 00:53:56,472
but the manner in which they're combined.

711
00:53:56,572 --> 00:53:58,572
These kids are getting very smart.

712
00:54:03,172 --> 00:54:05,172
He's right.

713
00:54:05,372 --> 00:54:07,372
The ravers are the key.

714
00:54:07,472 --> 00:54:10,472
Aren't you the clever little chunky monkey?

715
00:54:10,672 --> 00:54:14,072
You keep banging on about my weight.
You're crossing a line.

716
00:54:14,172 --> 00:54:16,172
Arthur, it was a joke.

717
00:54:16,372 --> 00:54:18,672
It was a joke. Smile.

718
00:54:18,872 --> 00:54:20,872
Smile.

719
00:54:20,972 --> 00:54:22,572
You fat cunt.

720
00:54:24,772 --> 00:54:26,772
Yo, Blowjob.

721
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:32,672
P-O-S 51. Comes in blue or race-car red.

722
00:54:32,772 --> 00:54:35,672
Destination: stratosphere.

723
00:54:38,372 --> 00:54:42,572
Only, this one gets you
there in 60 seconds.

724
00:54:42,672 --> 00:54:44,872
You try one first.

725
00:54:44,972 --> 00:54:46,972
Thought you'd never ask.

726
00:55:01,272 --> 00:55:03,572
P-O-S 51?

727
00:55:03,672 --> 00:55:05,672
You can't call it that.

728
00:55:05,772 --> 00:55:09,172
Punters'll feel like right tits
asking for tabs of 438 I-O-U,

729
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:13,272
whatever the number is. No-one's
going to know what they're on about.

730
00:55:13,472 --> 00:55:17,372
These scumbags spend their entire life
smacked out of their heads.

731
00:55:17,572 --> 00:55:21,072
Numbers - they couldn't even tell you
what fucking time it is.

732
00:55:24,072 --> 00:55:26,172
All right, Mr. Smug, what have you done?

733
00:55:29,372 --> 00:55:31,672
I think the shit's about to hit the fan.

734
00:55:46,772 --> 00:55:50,572
Arrrrrgh!

735
00:55:53,872 --> 00:55:55,472
Phew. Eurgh.

736
00:56:01,072 --> 00:56:04,172
Curry was a bad idea, lads.

737
00:56:09,772 --> 00:56:11,372
Oh yeah

738
00:56:11,572 --> 00:56:14,172
Please. Please.

739
00:56:18,572 --> 00:56:21,172
Oh, thanks. Oh, thanks.

You can even lay a goddamn pipeline

774
00:59:24,972 --> 00:59:28,572
Chemistry... Mr. McElroy.

775
00:59:30,772 --> 00:59:32,772
What is chemistry...

776
00:59:34,072 --> 00:59:37,872
..but the ability to attract
adoration in others?

777
00:59:43,572 --> 00:59:46,172
You see, you're like me, Mr. McElroy.

778
00:59:46,272 --> 00:59:49,772
You're a sky-highatrist,
I'm a sky-highatrist.

779
00:59:49,872 --> 00:59:53,272
See always knew'd be a drug dealer
even when was a kid

780
00:59:53,372 --> 00:59:56,172
saw my dad hit my mother
my mother hit my brother

781
00:59:56,372 --> 00:59:59,072
my brother hit my sister,
and my sister fuck my father.

782
00:59:59,272 --> 01:00:00,972
So it's inevitable, really.

783
01:00:01,072 --> 01:00:05,072
You'd have to be on drugs just to
live in that madhouse, wouldn't you?

784
01:00:05,172 --> 01:00:08,172
Drugs are good, Mr. McElroy.

785
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:11,372
Drugs are our mates.

786
01:00:13,272 --> 01:00:16,872
Fuck. I'm getting on my own nerves.

787
01:00:18,472 --> 01:00:21,372
What I'm trying to say to you, Mr.
McElroy, is...

788
01:00:24,472 --> 01:00:28,572
..I'm very much attracted
to what you have to offer.

789
01:00:41,272 --> 01:00:43,272
How are you doing, Felix?

790
01:00:44,372 --> 01:00:46,372
Well, my boss is dead...

791
01:00:47,572 --> 01:00:49,972
..can't get a ticket for tomorrow's match,

792
01:00:50,172 --> 01:00:53,372
and, oh, yeah,
I've got a fucking bullet hole in the arse.

793
01:00:54,572 --> 01:00:56,372
Apart from that,

794
01:00:56,472 --> 01:00:58,472
I'm tiptop.

795
01:01:02,172 --> 01:01:04,172
So who's the target?

796
01:01:04,272 --> 01:01:06,972
You've got that look in your eye.

797
01:01:07,072 --> 01:01:09,072
I've been looking for you

798
01:01:09,272 --> 01:01:13,072
Oh, yeah? For old times' sake
or for the company I keep?

799
01:01:13,172 --> 01:01:15,272
Little bit of both.

800
01:01:18,072 --> 01:01:20,072
So, you have got me on your list, then?

801
01:01:21,372 --> 01:01:23,372
You've always been on my list.

802
01:01:25,972 --> 01:01:28,572
40 years ago

803
01:01:28,672 --> 01:01:33,172
a rock-and-roll revolution
was launched in this town.

804
01:01:34,772 --> 01:01:38,972
Tonight, we're going to
launch a new revolution.

805
01:01:40,472 --> 01:01:46,472
One that will rock and roll your senses.

806
01:01:48,272 --> 01:01:52,072
And you... are my test pilots.

807
01:01:52,272 --> 01:01:59,872
You're going to kiss the sun
and taste the motherfuckin' rainbow.

808
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:08,772
Are you ready?

809
01:02:08,872 --> 01:02:13,272
Are... you... ready?

810
01:02:13,372 --> 01:02:18,972
Then let's get ready to party-y-y-y.

811
01:02:20,672 --> 01:02:23,772
Synaesthesia

812
01:03:02,872 --> 01:03:05,272
Have you any idea how much I missed you?

813
01:03:05,372 --> 01:03:06,972
Why didn't you stay with me, then?

814
01:03:07,172 --> 01:03:09,772
What, me? in America? Don't be soft!

815
01:03:09,872 --> 01:03:12,772
Besides, I don't know who
you are any more, girl.

816
01:03:12,972 --> 01:03:16,972
It's been nearly two years.
I haven't heard a word.

817
01:03:20,072 --> 01:03:22,072
Still...

818
01:03:23,172 --> 01:03:24,972
I always hoped...

819
01:03:28,772 --> 01:03:30,772
..you might...

820
01:03:30,872 --> 01:03:32,572
change your mind...

821
01:03:33,672 --> 01:03:36,272
..and come home.

822
01:03:39,472 --> 01:03:41,472
We could have a fresh start.

823
01:03:45,172 --> 01:03:47,172
Aren't you going to say anything?

824
01:04:16,572 --> 01:04:19,872
This, Mr. McElroy, is a fucking miracle.

825
01:04:19,972 --> 01:04:25,072
Drug use will reach epidemic proportions,
revolutions will break out, governments will fall!

826
01:04:25,972 --> 01:04:28,672
20 million, and not a penny less!

827
01:04:28,772 --> 01:04:31,072
- Where do I sign?
- Si... Sign?!

828
01:04:31,172 --> 01:04:33,172
This ain't some written contract.

829
01:04:33,372 --> 01:04:36,572
The kind of agreement I could take
you to court and sue your ass over.

830
01:04:36,672 --> 01:04:38,672
You fuck me on this deal,

831
01:04:38,872 --> 01:04:42,072
I gotta take out a contract just to
get even on the goddamn contract!

832
01:04:42,172 --> 01:04:45,272
We think we have an agreement,
we think we see things the same way.

833
01:04:45,472 --> 01:04:46,672
Either we do, or we don't.

834
01:04:46,772 --> 01:04:48,472
You're either in, or you're out.

835
01:04:48,572 --> 01:04:51,372
You give me the money, I give
you the formula. Are we clear?

836
01:04:52,572 --> 01:04:56,172
Crystal, Mr. McElroy. Crystal.

837
01:04:56,272 --> 01:04:59,372
I'm not Leo Durant. I'm a man of my word.

838
01:04:59,472 --> 01:05:01,572
Get in my way,

839
01:05:01,672 --> 01:05:03,772
and I'm gonna have to shoot you.

840
01:05:06,372 --> 01:05:08,772
Get in my way,
and I'm gonna have to shoot you again.

841
01:05:10,572 --> 01:05:12,572
I've got to work, babe.

842
01:05:16,072 --> 01:05:18,572
Fucking cow!

843
01:05:25,272 --> 01:05:27,072
Oh, fuck!

844
01:05:29,172 --> 01:05:32,772
Can't a brother just
deal some goddamn drugs?

845
01:05:35,472 --> 01:05:38,072
Time to go, Elmo.

846
01:05:53,572 --> 01:05:56,172
Mr. Kane. Is it that time
of the month already?

847
01:05:56,272 --> 01:05:59,772
I thought you weren't due till next week,
you eager beaver.

848
01:06:08,672 --> 01:06:11,372
Now, ain't that always the way?

849
01:06:11,472 --> 01:06:14,172
Elevator music, a nigger in a kilt,

850
01:06:14,272 --> 01:06:17,272
and a chick with a nickel-plated nine.

851
01:06:21,372 --> 01:06:23,372
And now a word from our sponsor.

852
01:06:23,472 --> 01:06:25,472
That ain't no Liverpool accent.

853
01:06:26,872 --> 01:06:28,872
- Say hello, Elmo.
- Hello, Elmo.

854
01:06:28,972 --> 01:06:32,372
Absence makes the heart grow fonder Elmo

855
01:06:32,472 --> 01:06:35,272
And The Lizard so full of

856
01:06:35,372 --> 01:06:37,372
motherfucking fonderence for you

857
01:06:37,572 --> 01:06:42,172
that he got on this plane
just to come see you.

858
01:06:42,272 --> 01:06:43,972
I'm touched.

859
01:06:44,172 --> 01:06:46,472
- You will be.
- You got my cash?

860
01:06:46,672 --> 01:06:49,372
You're flush, sweetcakes. You are flush.

861
01:06:50,572 --> 01:06:53,772
He's looking forward to seeing you.

862
01:07:06,072 --> 01:07:08,972
So, what's the price tag on my ass?

863
01:07:09,072 --> 01:07:11,072
It's enough. Move.

864
01:07:25,472 --> 01:07:28,872
Last stop. There's nowhere
from here but down.

865
01:07:28,972 --> 01:07:30,472
Reel me in!

866
01:07:30,672 --> 01:07:32,872
Why would I dream of doing
a stupid thing like that?

867
01:07:32,972 --> 01:07:36,072
- Pull me up, will you?
- Fold or call?

868
01:07:36,172 --> 01:07:40,272
- What?
- You play poker. Fold or call?

869
01:07:40,372 --> 01:07:42,472
I'm your last chance, girl.

870
01:07:42,572 --> 01:07:44,772
I'm that out you've been looking for.

871
01:07:44,872 --> 01:07:47,772
I'm only gonna make this offer once.

872
01:07:47,872 --> 01:07:50,372
You either take it
and get out from under The Lizard's ass

873
01:07:50,572 --> 01:07:53,272
or you stay a slave
and wonder where your life went.

874
01:07:53,372 --> 01:07:56,572
You think you can save me, do you?
Look where you are!

875
01:07:56,772 --> 01:08:00,172
- Get real!
- A million in bonds, untraceable.

876
01:08:00,372 --> 01:08:03,172
That's real! That's a fresh start.

877
01:08:03,372 --> 01:08:06,972
Try quitting while you're ahead
for a change... Dawn.

878
01:08:07,172 --> 01:08:09,172
- No.
- No?!

879
01:08:12,372 --> 01:08:15,372
I want 10% of your deal with Iki.

880
01:08:15,472 --> 01:08:17,072
You're negotiating with me?!

881
01:08:17,172 --> 01:08:18,772
Look at your options.

882
01:08:21,372 --> 01:08:22,972
10%.

883
01:08:23,172 --> 01:08:25,272
Have a look at yours.

884
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:31,072
All right.

885
01:08:42,672 --> 01:08:45,572
Now that is a lovely dress.

886
01:08:45,772 --> 01:08:47,172
Need the extra room, do you?

887
01:08:47,372 --> 01:08:49,172
Tell me something. I'm intrigued.

888
01:08:49,372 --> 01:08:52,272
Is it true that you fellas are equipped
with incredibly...

889
01:08:55,372 --> 01:08:57,072
..large...

890
01:08:58,972 --> 01:09:00,472
Fuck!

891
01:09:02,672 --> 01:09:04,272
Thanks.

892
01:09:04,472 --> 01:09:05,672
My pleasure.

893
01:09:05,772 --> 01:09:07,172
You can move your arm now.

894
01:09:12,172 --> 01:09:14,172
Right, then you Scouse git

895
01:09:15,272 --> 01:09:17,272
In the last 12 hours

896
01:09:17,372 --> 01:09:20,572
this city has gone from a peaceful,
fun-loving, Utopia

897
01:09:20,672 --> 01:09:22,672
to an all-out fucking war zone.

898
01:09:22,872 --> 01:09:24,872
And I, Virgil Kane...

899
01:09:25,972 --> 01:09:27,972
Well, I want to know why.

900
01:09:28,072 --> 01:09:33,272
Nobody cuts me out of anything
in this parochial pisshole.

901
01:09:33,872 --> 01:09:35,272
You smell that, Felix. Smell it.

902
01:09:35,372 --> 01:09:37,772
Smell it!

903
01:09:37,872 --> 01:09:39,872
That is essence of Durant.

904
01:09:41,172 --> 01:09:43,972
And Durant got what he deserved.

905
01:09:44,072 --> 01:09:46,572
So, when a deal goes down,

906
01:09:46,772 --> 01:09:50,272
you, my old sausage, will fix it.
Time and place.

907
01:09:50,472 --> 01:09:52,572
And then you will call me.

908
01:09:52,672 --> 01:09:55,772
Otherwise... Accessory to murder.

909
01:09:56,872 --> 01:09:59,672
Possession of a firearm.

910
01:09:59,772 --> 01:10:01,572
You fuck me,

911
01:10:01,772 --> 01:10:03,772
I'll have you on your hands and your knees,

912
01:10:03,872 --> 01:10:08,272
with your arse in the air, exposing your
rusty sheriff's badge for the next 20 years.

913
01:10:10,872 --> 01:10:13,872
So ask yourself, are you
going to help restore

914
01:10:14,072 --> 01:10:16,372
some national pride,
and stick one on the Yanks?

915
01:10:16,472 --> 01:10:19,672
Or, like the rest of your life,
are you going to piss it all away?

916
01:10:21,272 --> 01:10:23,572
Are you going to help me

917
01:10:23,772 --> 01:10:25,372
to help you?

918
01:10:25,472 --> 01:10:27,472
Eight hours till kickoff.

919
01:10:30,072 --> 01:10:31,772
It's a big game.

920
01:10:32,972 --> 01:10:35,872
Let's just see if you come good.

921
01:10:46,672 --> 01:10:48,172
Mr. Kane.

922
01:10:54,672 --> 01:10:57,272
See ya!

923
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:01,872
You'll never walk alone, eh, mate?

924
01:11:18,972 --> 01:11:20,972
Help me to help you? Cunt!

925
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:53,672
How do you think that motherfucker
would do against people who diss

926
01:11:53,772 --> 01:11:57,272
like Soso McGure Grffy?
They'd be knocking this shit out the park

927
01:11:57,372 --> 01:12:00,372
He can't throw that kinda heat!
Kevin? s got what's goin' on here!

928
01:12:00,572 --> 01:12:03,472
- You don't know what you? re taking about
DAWN: Bullshit

929
01:12:03,572 --> 01:12:07,072
Kevin Brown couldn't carry
Sandy Koufax's jockstrap.

930
01:12:07,172 --> 01:12:09,572
You've been listening to
too much Vince Scully.

931
01:12:09,672 --> 01:12:13,972
You need to get your ear out of the radio,
and carry your ass out to the ball game.

932
01:12:15,572 --> 01:12:17,572
Sorry, but er...

933
01:12:18,772 --> 01:12:20,372
..have I missed something?

934
01:12:26,372 --> 01:12:27,772
What the fuck is that?

935
01:12:27,972 --> 01:12:31,872
- Black pudding. Fried pig's blood.
- Oh!

936
01:12:32,072 --> 01:12:34,572
Are you two planning on
filling me in, or what?

937
01:12:36,872 --> 01:12:38,772
Elmo's propositioned her.

938
01:12:38,872 --> 01:12:41,072
Nice one, Shirley.

939
01:12:41,172 --> 01:12:42,672
I'm listening.

940
01:12:42,872 --> 01:12:46,872
Lizard offered Dakota 250K
to deliver my live ass to him.

941
01:12:47,072 --> 01:12:50,672
I've made her a significantly better offer.

942
01:12:50,772 --> 01:12:53,572
And I'm thinking... she might entertain...

943
01:12:54,672 --> 01:12:57,172
..certain sentimental reasons
for not doing her job.

944
01:12:57,272 --> 01:12:59,072
The question is

945
01:12:59,272 --> 01:13:02,472
whether it's going to pay me...
to be sentimental.

946
01:13:07,872 --> 01:13:10,172
Look, we have a choice.

947
01:13:10,972 --> 01:13:14,872
We can use our "Get out
of jail free" cards,

948
01:13:14,972 --> 01:13:20,872
or we can choose "Stop, do not pass Go".
Do not collect 20 million dollars.

949
01:13:22,372 --> 01:13:24,372
Do we have a deal?

950
01:13:29,272 --> 01:13:32,072
Do that again, I will
definitely fucking shoot you.

951
01:13:32,172 --> 01:13:34,672
Shut your gob! Go and get
yourself cleaned up!

952
01:13:43,572 --> 01:13:45,672
- And no shagging up there!
- Yeah.

953
01:13:45,772 --> 01:13:48,272
No shagging up there.

954
01:14:01,572 --> 01:14:03,572
We do this job and we get out.

955
01:14:12,672 --> 01:14:14,672
It's what we all want, isn't it?

956
01:14:17,272 --> 01:14:19,272

Listen! It's got to come from your belly.

978
01:15:48,272 --> 01:15:50,772
Right deep down!

979
01:15:50,872 --> 01:15:52,872
It's your birth trauma.

980
01:15:53,072 --> 01:15:56,972
Now cleanse your charkas
and let it all out.

981
01:16:03,472 --> 01:16:06,872
- Let it go!
- I'm trying, you fucking fairy!

982
01:16:07,072 --> 01:16:09,072
A-a-a-a-ah!

983
01:16:09,172 --> 01:16:13,272
All right? A-a-a-ah!

984
01:16:13,372 --> 01:16:15,972
A-a-a-a-a-ah!

985
01:16:18,872 --> 01:16:21,972
- All-righty. Good morning.
- All right, let's finish this deal.

986
01:16:22,072 --> 01:16:24,072
My sentiments exactly.

987
01:16:25,272 --> 01:16:28,272
- Any particular venue?
- No airports no hotel rooms

988
01:16:28,372 --> 01:16:31,672
no dockyards, no barges, no pharmacies,

989
01:16:31,772 --> 01:16:33,572
- no animal-testing labs.
- Oh!

990
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:37,172
- No rooftops.
- Riddles! Riddles! I love riddles.

991
01:16:37,272 --> 01:16:40,272
No abandoned warehouses or rave clubs.

992
01:16:42,572 --> 01:16:44,572
I want total privacy

993
01:16:44,672 --> 01:16:47,372
in a very public place.

994
01:16:48,672 --> 01:16:50,672
And security.

995
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:53,072
Cops. Lots of them.

996
01:16:53,272 --> 01:16:56,272
And witnesses. Thousands of witnesses.

997
01:16:56,472 --> 01:17:00,072
- You getting my drift?
- Well er I've got a certain er

998
01:17:00,272 --> 01:17:04,572
business indulgence, shall we say,
that I could er... utilise.

999
01:17:04,672 --> 01:17:07,672
- So, what time's kickoff?
- Three o? clock sharp

1000
01:17:07,772 --> 01:17:08,872
I'll be there.

1001
01:17:09,072 --> 01:17:10,772
Football and drugs.

1002
01:17:10,872 --> 01:17:12,872
A perfect Saturday afternoon.

1003
01:17:14,572 --> 01:17:16,572
Liverpool!

1004
01:17:16,672 --> 01:17:18,672
Liverpool!

1005
01:17:18,872 --> 01:17:20,172
Come on!

1006
01:17:20,272 --> 01:17:21,472
Charkas!

1007
01:17:43,072 --> 01:17:45,072
No, no, no, no, no, chubster.

1008
01:17:45,172 --> 01:17:47,172
- You stay here.
- What for?

1009
01:17:47,272 --> 01:17:52,572
I don't know. Keep your eyes peeled on the exit.
And try for fuck's sake to blend in, cunt!

1010
01:17:56,072 --> 01:17:58,072
This clown better deliver.

1011
01:17:58,172 --> 01:18:01,772
Don't worry. Iki put something like this
together a couple of years ago now.

1012
01:18:01,872 --> 01:18:03,472
Yeah? What happened?

1013
01:18:03,572 --> 01:18:05,072
They all died.

1014
01:18:07,272 --> 01:18:09,272
We get in, we get out.

1015
01:18:09,372 --> 01:18:11,372
What about the game?

1016
01:18:11,472 --> 01:18:15,472
- We're staying to watch the game, right?
- Dude, I'm in, then I'm out.

1017
01:18:24,672 --> 01:18:30,572
Virgin Atlantic announce
the arrival of Flight ES12 from Los Angeles

1018
01:18:34,172 --> 01:18:35,372
Any glass bottles?

1019
01:18:35,472 --> 01:18:38,772
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Welcome to Anfield, the home of football.

1020
01:18:38,872 --> 01:18:41,772
- Too right, pal.
- McElroy, DeSouza.

1021
01:18:41,872 --> 01:18:46,372
Yes, sir. Take the lift to the third floor.
It's the first door on your right, sir.

1022
01:18:46,472 --> 01:18:48,472
Thank you.

1023
01:18:49,772 --> 01:18:52,272
- Sir?
- Don't you want to search me?

1024
01:18:53,572 --> 01:18:56,872
Guests for the executive suites
are never searched, sir.

1025
01:18:58,172 --> 01:19:00,672
Right. I knew that.

1026
01:19:13,972 --> 01:19:16,072
Welcome! Come in, come in.

1027
01:19:19,572 --> 01:19:21,672
Excellent.

1028
01:19:21,772 --> 01:19:25,372
I'm nothing if not hospitable, Felix.
Make yourself at home.

1029
01:19:25,572 --> 01:19:28,472
Iki: I'm so excited I could shit!

1030
01:19:34,272 --> 01:19:37,172
- Huh?
- Right, Mr. McElroy, a drink

1031
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:39,272
while tell you about my plans

1032
01:19:39,472 --> 01:19:41,472
Oh I've got plans Mr. McEroy

1033
01:19:41,572 --> 01:19:44,872
- Big fucking plans.
- Hey hey hey!

1034
01:19:44,972 --> 01:19:47,072
No talk. You want a beverage?

1035
01:19:48,172 --> 01:19:50,872
I'll fix your beverage
while you get the 20 mill.

1036
01:19:51,972 --> 01:19:54,672
I give you the formula, you smile,

1037
01:19:54,872 --> 01:19:56,072
we toast,

1038
01:19:56,172 --> 01:19:58,172
we pretend we're friends,

1039
01:19:59,272 --> 01:20:02,572
- and we go our separate ways.
- Foreplay Mr. McEroy

1040
01:20:02,672 --> 01:20:05,872
- It's the only way to a good relationship.
- Ah

1041
01:20:05,972 --> 01:20:09,372
Iki, my love, we're way past holding hands.

1042
01:20:22,772 --> 01:20:25,272
20 million in bonds. Untraceable.

1043
01:20:25,372 --> 01:20:29,572
What?! Is that supposed to be 20 mill?

1044
01:20:29,672 --> 01:20:33,772
I'm not heftin' gold bars around the shop,
am I? It's not fucking Goldfinger, is it?

1045
01:20:33,872 --> 01:20:35,272
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

1046
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:37,372
Easy, flower.

1047
01:20:37,572 --> 01:20:39,272
Where's my formula?

1048
01:20:48,872 --> 01:20:51,272
Wish you were here?

1049
01:21:04,072 --> 01:21:08,072
I'm fucking there, Mr. McElroy.
I'm fucking there.

1050
01:21:08,272 --> 01:21:10,272
An inspired choice, I must say,

1051
01:21:10,472 --> 01:21:13,272
my er... chemical brother.

1052
01:21:13,972 --> 01:21:14,972
Cheers.

1053
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:19,472
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

1054
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:28,172
I never was one to be too sentimental.

1055
01:21:30,872 --> 01:21:32,872
Elmo!

1056
01:21:34,572 --> 01:21:36,172
It ain't often

1057
01:21:36,372 --> 01:21:40,872
that a blowed-up motherfucker gets to chat
to the motherfucker that blowed him up.

1058
01:21:40,972 --> 01:21:42,772
You got that right.

1059
01:21:42,872 --> 01:21:46,672
Usually, the blowed-up motherfucker
has the courtesy to stay blowed up.

1060
01:21:46,772 --> 01:21:49,572
I'll try to be more
accommodating next time, Elmo.

1061
01:21:52,072 --> 01:21:54,372
Ooh, cocktails! What are we celebrating?

1062
01:21:54,572 --> 01:21:57,272
Oh, er... we're toasting...

1063
01:21:58,472 --> 01:22:00,472
..our deal, Mr. Lizard.

1064
01:22:01,572 --> 01:22:03,072
- Our deal?
- Not your deal.

1065
01:22:03,172 --> 01:22:05,272
Hands across the ocean you might say

1066
01:22:05,472 --> 01:22:07,172
Fucking twat.

1067
01:22:07,272 --> 01:22:09,472
Elmo Mix-Master.

1068
01:22:11,972 --> 01:22:14,472
Cheers.

1069
01:22:16,072 --> 01:22:18,872
- I love your touches.
- To a global partnership.

1070
01:22:19,072 --> 01:22:21,272
To a global partnership!

1071
01:22:25,672 --> 01:22:27,072
Ow.

1072
01:22:28,272 --> 01:22:30,372
Fucking limey bastard.

1073
01:22:30,472 --> 01:22:33,672
Global partnership, my ass!

1074
01:22:33,872 --> 01:22:38,372
My money is on good old-fashioned
American monopoly, you son of a bitch!

1075
01:22:38,572 --> 01:22:40,372
Besides,

1076
01:22:40,472 --> 01:22:43,172
England ain't nothin'...

1077
01:22:43,372 --> 01:22:46,472
nothing' but the 51st. state!

1078
01:22:47,672 --> 01:22:52,872
Don't you just fucking hate it
when a motherfucker stabs you in the back?

1079
01:22:55,672 --> 01:22:59,572
The Lizard travelled 12,000 miles
to settle accounts with you!

1080
01:22:59,672 --> 01:23:01,272
So? What?

1081
01:23:01,372 --> 01:23:04,472
You gonna tell me how much you missed me,
or are you gonna shoot me?

1082
01:23:04,572 --> 01:23:07,472
I'm sick and tired of
fucking chasing your ass!

1083
01:23:07,572 --> 01:23:11,072
Now, you give me my fucking goods,
and you give 'em to me fucking now!

1084
01:23:12,772 --> 01:23:15,072
You better chill with
that shit, motherfucker.

1085
01:23:15,172 --> 01:23:17,172
- Own you!
- You own me?

1086
01:23:17,272 --> 01:23:20,072
- I fucking own you!
- You own shit!

1087
01:23:20,172 --> 01:23:24,172
Go ahead, kill me. Put me out of my misery
for the first time in 30 years.

1088
01:23:24,272 --> 01:23:26,872
But you will no longer take what is mine.

1089
01:23:26,972 --> 01:23:28,472
Fucking right. 10% is mine.

1090
01:23:28,572 --> 01:23:31,972
- Five!
- Five fucking per cent of that's mine.

1091
01:23:32,172 --> 01:23:34,772
Shut the fuck up!
I don't even know who the fuck you are!

1092
01:23:38,072 --> 01:23:40,272
Oh, you've got some big
fucking onions, Elmo.

1093
01:23:40,472 --> 01:23:42,472
This...

1094
01:23:42,572 --> 01:23:46,072
is the most expensive candy on the market.

1095
01:23:46,172 --> 01:23:48,372
The drug's a fake, you know.

1096
01:23:48,572 --> 01:23:52,672
It's bogus. It's what we
chemists call a placebo.

1097
01:23:52,872 --> 01:23:54,872
It's whatever you want it to be.

1098
01:23:56,272 --> 01:24:00,372
You can run all the tests you want, and it'll
look like the best shit in the universe,

1099
01:24:00,472 --> 01:24:05,172
but the ingredients... they
cancel each other out.

1100
01:24:05,372 --> 01:24:09,472
Fucking confusing The Lizard
ain't gonna fucking help your cause, Elmo.

1101
01:24:09,672 --> 01:24:11,872
You've gotta give big ups to marketing.

1102
01:24:11,972 --> 01:24:13,972
The ability to make people believe.

1103
01:24:14,072 --> 01:24:16,072
The power of suggestion.

1104
01:24:16,272 --> 01:24:18,772
P-O-S

1105
01:24:18,872 --> 01:24:20,872
51.

1106
01:24:22,272 --> 01:24:24,872
I don't give a shit!
Is this fucking science lecture over?

1107
01:24:25,072 --> 01:24:28,372
It will be in... 23 seconds.

1108
01:24:32,472 --> 01:24:35,572
It takes 10 seconds for an imbibed liquid
to reach the stomach

1109
01:24:35,872 --> 01:24:40,972
It takes the human body 81 seconds to heat that
liquid to the point of chemical volatility.

1110
01:24:43,372 --> 01:24:45,972
You... have 12 seconds left.

1111
01:24:46,072 --> 01:24:48,572
12 seconds?
What the fuck are you talking about?

1112
01:24:48,672 --> 01:24:50,572
And what is the big fucking umbrella?

1113
01:24:50,672 --> 01:24:51,972
Freeze!

1114
01:24:52,172 --> 01:24:53,872
- Oh!
- You lumpy

1115
01:24:53,972 --> 01:24:55,472
in the kaftan, drop the gun.

1116
01:24:55,572 --> 01:24:58,772
Nice and controlled.
How's my timing, Felix?

1117
01:24:58,972 --> 01:25:00,472
It's fucking perfect.

1118
01:25:00,572 --> 01:25:02,572
Ow! Argh!

1119
01:25:07,772 --> 01:25:09,572
Aaaargh!

1120
01:25:09,672 --> 01:25:10,972
Aargh!

1121
01:25:24,672 --> 01:25:26,672
That cleared my sinuses.

1122
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:31,472
Drugs...

1123
01:25:31,672 --> 01:25:33,472
always kill you in the end.

1124
01:25:45,772 --> 01:25:48,572
Whoa! Whoa. Whoa, shit!

1125
01:25:51,072 --> 01:25:53,672
All right, lads.

1126
01:25:53,772 --> 01:25:56,272
Get the cuffs on this cockney twat!

1127
01:25:59,872 --> 01:26:01,872
As agreed.

1128
01:26:03,772 --> 01:26:05,772
What about the drug?

1129
01:26:05,872 --> 01:26:08,472
You conned us.

1130
01:26:08,672 --> 01:26:10,672
I conned them...

1131
01:26:10,772 --> 01:26:13,072
We got paid.

1132
01:26:15,172 --> 01:26:16,172
Is this,

1133
01:26:16,272 --> 01:26:18,972
or is this not, worth 20 million dollars?

1134
01:26:22,272 --> 01:26:23,972
This castle's worth,

1135
01:26:24,072 --> 01:26:26,072
I'd say, more like...

1136
01:26:26,172 --> 01:26:28,272
seven, seven and a half.

1137
01:26:41,472 --> 01:26:43,472

Mr. McElroy,

1142
01:27:15,572 --> 01:27:18,772
you are a genuine McElroy like myself,
you say.

1143
01:27:18,872 --> 01:27:21,572
This is the tartan of my slave master.

1144
01:27:21,772 --> 01:27:25,872
I now claim his castle and
his lands for my own.

1145
01:27:25,972 --> 01:27:27,972
I see.

1146
01:27:28,172 --> 01:27:31,472
- But will you not now be making your putt?
- Aye

1147
01:27:40,372 --> 01:27:45,472
Congratulations, Mr. McElroy.
An outstanding round of golf.

1148
01:27:45,572 --> 01:27:47,572
You ain't seen nothing yet.

1149

Well!

1150
