2
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,084
I'm afraid you're on
a wild goose chase, Mr. Chan.

3
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,490
Have sometimes caught wild goose.

4
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:38,496
Well, if you ask me, there's something fishy
about the whole business.

5
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,863
A man walks out on a fortune
seven years ago.

6
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:46,803
Then all of a sudden,
he appears from nowhere to claim it.

7
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:50,239
A little tough on the Colby heirs
if he's alive.

8
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:53,676
- Tough on Allen Colby if dead.
- Yeah.

9
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,685
Ah. They're bringing him up now.

10
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,608
Get back.

11
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,920
Take in on the winch.

12
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,920
<i>All right, swing him aboard.</i>

13
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,861
All right, get him down there.

14
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,938
Body not that of Allen Colby.

15
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:02,071
- Well, I guess that ends it.
- Not so certain.

16
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,179
Passenger list indicate
30 persons on board.

17
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:10,017
Twenty-seven rescued by lifeboats.

18
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,648
Two bodies recovered today.

19
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,922
Twenty-seven plus two make 29.

20
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,691
Leave one body missing.

21
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:22,928
Maybe Allen Colby escape
by clinging to wreckage.

22
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,561
Well, if he did,
the sharks got him by now.

23
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,004
You can't drift around
in these waters for two weeks.

24
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:31,440
May have been picked up
by boat without radio.

25
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,411
Must not overlook any possibility.

26
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,612
Mr. Chan.

27
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,518
- I found this in one of the bunks.
- Thank you so much.

<i>Initials A.C.</i>

29
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,396
Allen Colby.

30
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:24,560
As soon as you get Duke aboard,
get under way!

31
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,791
How soon we make port?

32
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,924
Oh, a couple of hours.

33
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,094
May send radiogram, please?

34
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:34,970
Sure. They can relay it
from the land station.

35
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,177
What do you wanna say?

36
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,943
To Mrs. Henrietta Lowell,
San Francisco.

37
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,816
Fate of Allen Colby still uncertain.

38
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:55,824
Leaving Honolulu at once
on new clipper airship...

39
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:59,989
to continue investigation
on mainland.

40
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,659
Sign Charlie Chan, please.

00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,493
"D." Dead.

45
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,425
There can be no doubt, Baxter.

46
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:38,664
Allen is dead.
It was a message from his father.

47
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:42,229
To be perfectly frank, madam...

48
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,106
- this sort of thing makes me quite creepy.
- Oh, nonsense.

49
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,245
A radiogram, Mrs. Lowell.

50
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,979
We haven't finished yet.
Sit down.

51
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,651
Hand me the telephone.

52
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:09,434
Oh, get off the wire, Alice.
You can talk to Dick some other time.

53
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:13,562
All right, Mother, in just a second.
Dick, I'll have to go now.

54
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,573
All right.
Now remember, darling...

55
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,644
we've got a date tonight if the chief
doesn't send me out on a story.

56
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:23,944
Well, I like that. You think more
of your old newspaper than you do me.

57
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,885
Well, Dick, I simply must hang up now.
Mother wants to use the phone.

58
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,320
Of course I do.

59
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,392
Good-bye.

60
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,496
- Call Mr. Phelps's office for me.
- Yes, ma'am.

61
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,967
- What is the wire?
- Another radiogram from Charlie Chan.

62
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,767
- He's arriving sometime today.
- The line's busy, ma'am.

63
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:51,002
Try again. And remind me
to call Professor Bowan.

64
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,739
I want to tell him that we're holding
a sיance tonight at 8:30.

65
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:57,611
If you have nothing else to do,
take some flowers out to Colby House...

66
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:00,015
and tell Ulrich
to have everything ready.

67
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,417
- All right, Mother.
- Do you want Baxter to help you?

68
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:06,117
No, thanks. I'll shanghai Dick.

69
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:10,525
Hello, Mr. Phelps?
Just one moment. Mrs. Lowell.

70
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,530
Hello, Warren.

71
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:16,830
It's your mother.
Yes, Mrs. Lowell.

72
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,836
He's arriving today?

73
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,103
Yes, everything concerning
the estate is in order.

74
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:27,111
<i>I've been going over matters with your son-in-law.</i>
<i>He and Mrs. Gage are here now.</i>

75
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:32,616
Certainly, I'll tell them to be there.
At 8:30.

76
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:35,983
Yes, I'll come too. Good-bye.

77
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,147
Was she talking about Allen?

78
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:41,454
No, Charlie Chan.
He's arriving this afternoon.

79
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,927
He must have definite news
about Allen.

80
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,624
Otherwise, he wouldn't be coming
all the way from Honolulu.

81
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,893
I don't see why Mother
had to drag him into this.

82
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,231
Well, you can hardly blame her
for being worried.

83
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:54,067
If Allen is alive, it places
a great responsibility on her.

84
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:57,836
But from what you've said,
it places a great responsibility on all of us.

85
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:01,744
We'll have to turn the estate over to him
and account for every penny we've spent.

86
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:04,043
Well, after all,
it was his father's money.

87
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,084
But Mother was Uncle Bernard's sister.

88
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,983
Regardless of Allen,
she should be entitled to something.

89
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:12,649
Unfortunately not,
if Allen is alive.

- Hello, Alice.
- Hmm. Where were you
when I called at the office?

99
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,767
Now wait a minute.
I had to go out on a story.

100
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,203
So I phoned your mother,
and she said you were coming here.

101
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:45,368
- Well, I wanted you to help me with these flowers.
- More spook business tonight?

102
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,710
Oh, please don't kid about it, Dick.
At least not when Mother's around.

103
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,874
I'm always nervous
when I come to this old house.

104
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:56,853
Oh, don't worry. I won't let the old bogeyman
get you. I want you myself.

105
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:00,517
Even if Allen came back and claimed
all the money and I was poor?

106
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:03,527
Say, when I marry,
I don't expect to work for a living.

107
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,189
Aw, go away.
You're just a fortune hunter.

108
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,528
How'd you guess it?

109
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,534
<i>- [Loud Crash]</i>
- Dick, what's that?

110
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,536
Well, it's not a ghost!

00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,818
There, Alice. You have the solution
to all ghost stories.

114
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,012
Not to all the things
that happen in this house.

115
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:33,114
You know, I don't see why your mother doesn't
have this old squirrel's cage torn down.

116
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,887
She's too devout a believer
in psychic research.

117
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:39,021
Why, this place means as much to her
as it did to Uncle Bernard.

118
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:41,031
Yeah, and he was a little cracked.

119
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:44,227
Oh, don't say that, Dick.
He believed in it.

120
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:47,931
That's why he rebuilt this house
with all these funny rooms.

121
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,372
So the poor spirits
could have a home.

122
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,468
Come on. Let's get out of here
and go somewheres a little more cheerful.

123
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:57,606
Not yet. I have to arrange those flowers
for tonight's sיance.

124
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,912
And you're going to help me.

125
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:08,022
I very rarely visit the old house, sir,
since Mr. Colby died.

126
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,118
It was only because
of your late arrival...

127
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,595
that Mrs. Lowell told me
to bring you here.

128
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,929
- Thank you.
- Oh, it's a pleasure, sir.

129
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,265
I don't mind admitting
to you frankly, sir...

130
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,066
that I don't feel at all myself
in this atmosphere.

131
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,607
- No?
- No, sir.

132
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:28,510
There's a tinge of the graveyard
which positively awes me.

133
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:32,675
Yes. Mysterious shadows of night
cling to old house...

134
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,310
like moss on tombstone?

135
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:40,290
Quite right— Quite right, sir.

136
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:44,226
That, sir, is the—
is the front door.

137
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:48,858
The—The back door
is... at the rear.

138
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:52,995
Most interesting.
Shall we enter by front door?

139
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,040
Yes. Yes.

140
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,130
This way, sir.

141
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,292
The family will be waiting
for you in here, sir.

142
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,996
These are the accounts
you spoke of, Mrs. Lowell.

143
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:28,096
No, not now.

144
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:31,870
- Mr. Chan.
- Oh. I'm so glad you arrived, Charlie.

<i>You know everyone here.</i>

after long drought.

148
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,187
Yes, yes, Mr. Chan,
but let's get to your report.

149
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,054
Yes, Charlie.
What about Allen?

150
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,059
Uh—

[Screeches]

152
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:20,358
Then it's your belief
that Allen is still alive?

153
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:25,192
Cannot be certain but, if so,
suspect life may be in danger.

154
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:29,233
- Now why do you say that?
- Observe.

155
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,270
More than one attempt
made on Allen Colby's life.

156
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:36,273
Just a scheme to create an impression.
This fellow may be an impostor.

157
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,071
Correction, please.

158
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:43,171
Passport visaed by French
and British consuls...

159
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,648
indicate he is real Allen Colby.

160
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:49,710
Then why did he wait all these years
before communicating with his family?

161
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,655
Investigation prove Allen Colby...

162
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,556
enlisted in French Foreign Legion...

163
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,788
was taken prisoner by Riffs.

164
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,956
<i>Escaped only recently.</i>

165
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,158
Could not have communicated sooner.

166
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:06,295
Unless he was drowned, we can expect him
to appear at any time to claim the estate?

167
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:10,102
<i>[Mrs. Lowell]</i>
<i>He has a right to the money, more than we have.</i>

168
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,404
What is it, Ulrich?

169
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:17,073
Uh, Professor Bowan and Carlotta
are ready to start the sיance.

170
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:20,913
<i>Tell them we'll be there in a moment,</i>
<i>and see that we're not disturbed.</i>

171
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:32,763
I can't stand that man!
He's forever staring at me.

172
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:36,460
<i>- Why don't we get rid ofhim?</i>
- We've gone over that before, Janice.

173
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,196
- Shall we go into the other room?
- Perhaps Mr. Chan would rather wait here.

174
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:42,706
- He may not be interested in a sיance.
- I'm sure he will be.

175
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:49,511
Tonight Professor Bowan has promised us
a message concerning Allen.

176
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:53,881
- I would like to have you present.
- Would appreciate very much.

177
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:59,117
- Chinese people interested in all things psychic.
- Yes.

178
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:04,428
Have they started
the sיance yet, Ulrich?

179
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,021
- They're just about to begin, miss.
- Thanks.

180
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:12,695
You're always causing me grief.
If we'd been late, Mother would have been furious.

181
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:21,035
- Is everything ready, Baxter?
- Yes, ma'am.

182
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,774
- Sorry I'm late, Mother.
- All my fault, Mrs. Lowell.

183
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,816
Say, you're Mr. Chan, aren't you?

184
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:29,046
- Humbly acknowledge name.
- Glad to meet you. I've heard a lot about you.

185
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,054
I'm Dick Williams of the <i>Globe.</i>

186
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:34,421
- Anything I can print on the Colby case?
- There's nothing for publication.

187
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,359
I've asked you repeatedly
to consider our family affairs confidential.

188
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:41,194
- Yes, but—
- Mr. Gage very wise.

189
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,531
Best place for skeleton
is in family closet.

190
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:47,935
Thank you.
Nothing to say.

191
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,338
Come, Charlie.

192
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:01,051
This is Professor Bowan,
our adviser in psychic research.

193
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,587
And this is our medium, Carlotta.

194
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,589
So pleased.

195
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,559
Most fortunate gift
to be able to cross bridge...

196
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:13,358
to dwelling place of honorable ancestors
before arriving.

197
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,365
Shall we begin?

198
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,903
If you'll take your usual seats,
we will commence.

199
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,078
Take this chair, Charlie.

200
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,637
- Will that be all right, Professor?
<i>- Quite all right.</i>

201
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:35,709
Tonight I wish to ask
for your special concentration.

202
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:40,485
We will try to bring word
of Allen Colby from the beyond.

203
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,890
<i>It may be difficult.</i>

204
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:46,658
<i>We shall ask his father,</i>
<i>Bernard Colby...</i>

205
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:50,428
<i>- who has been our guide before, to assist us.</i>
- [Mouthing Words]

206
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,838
We will pause a moment
in meditation.

207
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:17,157
Mr. Gage, will you
turn down the lights?

208
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,572
<i>##[Background: Eerie]</i>

209
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,443
There is a presence here.

210
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,679
He has a message for Mrs. Lowell.

211
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,553
<i>It is her brother, Bernard.</i>

212
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,991
<i>He says that Allen</i>
<i>is there with him.</i>

213
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,231
He is happy.

214
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,334
<i>He wants to come to you.</i>

215
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,373
[Screaming]

216
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,572
- Stop it!
- Lights! Turn on the lights!

217
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:20,050
Allen Colby... murdered.

218
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,889
Notify police immediately.

219
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,762
Touch nothing...

220
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,705
<i>until police arrive.</i>

221
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,637
- Thanks for your information, Mr. Chan.
- You welcome.

222
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:45,115
You know, what beats me is how Allen Colby
got ashore without our getting wind of it.

223
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,913
Somebody knew it. That's how
he trapped Colby here and finished him off.

224
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,920
He must have been trapped, all right.

225
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:54,584
You know, Allen was the type of fellow who
could have defended himself. A knife in the back.

226
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:58,595
If strength were all,
tiger would not fear scorpion.

227
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:03,100
- Not a sign of fingerprints.
- Oh, he used gloves or a handkerchief.

228
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,069
This fellow was smart enough for that.

229
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:12,368
Have observed former resting place
of murder weapon?

230
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:15,446
I've already checked that.
No fingerprints there either.

231
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:19,005
- What did you find, Doctor?
- Knife pierced right ventricle of the heart.

232
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,784
- He's been dead about four hours.
- You want an autopsy?

233
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,254
Oh, no, not necessary.
See you in the morning.

234
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:29,418
- Oh, Harris, got the rest
of them in the other room?
- Yes, sir.

235
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:33,123
Come along, Mr. Chan.
You too, Williams.

236
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,928
I want to talk to everyone
who was present here tonight.

237
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:41,830
Bowan, you must've been pretty sure
Colby was dead when you started your sיance.

238
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,171
That isn't true. We were merely seeking
a message concerning him.

239
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,177
Just before
this terrible thing happened...

240
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,680
I felt a strange
new presence about me.

241
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:54,479
I knew we were in contact
with Allen Colby's spirit.

242
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,680
And with his body
hidden behind the panel...

243
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,451
it was easy for his spirit
to get here, wasn't it?

244
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,551
Pardon interruption, please.

245
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:08,099
May ask cause of Allen Colby's
separation from family?

246
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,533
Oh, certainly, Charlie.
There had been a quarrel...

247
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:15,903
or rather a misunderstanding
between Allen and his father.

248
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:20,342
You see, Allen didn't share
our belief in psychic things.

249
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,345
Is this digging
into family affairs necessary?

250
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,283
It is when we're looking for facts.
If all I wanted was a motive...

251
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,648
It is when we're looking for facts.
If all I wanted was a motive...

252
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,185
I wouldn't have to go any further
than the Lowell family.

253
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,221
What do you mean by that?

254
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,222
Simple enough, isn't it?

255
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:36,192
Allen Colby alive meant
the loss of a fortune for all of you.

256
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,458
So sorry again to interrupt. Uh—

257
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:43,330
Money from Colby estate
used for psychic research?

258
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:45,630
<i>[Phelps]</i>
<i>As executor of the estate, I can answer that.</i>

259
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:49,935
Only such sums were used
as Mrs. Lowell saw fit to donate.

260
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:53,034
And that would have ended, too,
if Colby had returned?

261
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,979
Yes, I suppose so.

262
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:01,576
Were you here earlier today?

263
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:05,350
Why, yes. I stopped by
Ulrich's cottage about 6:00...

264
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:08,688
to remind him to have everything
in order for the sיance.

265
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:11,388
You were here at house?

266
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:16,798
No. I've had a slight cold, and I left
almost immediately to take care of it.

267
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,834
- Is that right?
- As far as I know, it is.

268
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:29,042
Pardon undue curiosity.

269
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:33,083
- You were here all day?
- That's what I get paid for.

270
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:37,053
Strange you did not know
Allen Colby had arrived.

271
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:40,818
I said once— I didn't.

272
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:45,022
Who else beside Professor Bowan
visit here today?

273
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,299
Why, I was here.

274
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,067
- You also?
- What for?

275
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,628
He came here to meet me
when I brought the flowers for the sיance.

276
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:58,437
- What time was that?
- Uh, I was here first.

277
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:02,377
Alice came in at 5:30. I'm sure of the time
because I noticed the clock was fast...

278
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,075
and I was about to reset it.

279
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:20,330
Strange.
Ancient clock tell very latest time now.

280
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:23,128
Someone must have fixed it!

281
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:30,905
Well, who reset the clock?

282
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,977
You don't think I'm lying, do you?

283
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,842
You arrived at what time, please?

284
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,847
About a quarter past 5:00.

285
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,679
And the murder took place
around 5:00.

286
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:43,983
I can tell you, Morton,
there was nothing wrong when I was here.

287
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,682
You and Miss Lowell were planning
to get married shortly, weren't you?

288
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:51,160
Why, yes. What of it?

289
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,163
Congratulations.

290
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,166
- Haven't we had enough of this inquisition?
- For tonight, yes.

291
00:23:56,268 --> 00:24:00,170
But until this matter is settled, be on hand
to give the authorities any help they need.

292
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,502
That's all.

293
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,598
Excuse, please.

294
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:10,740
- Ah, a headache for the police department.
- Yes.

295
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,908
Have you any ideas, Mr. Chan?

296
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,612
Solve mystery, cure headache.

297
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,553
[Chuckles]
Okay, we'll split a box of aspirin.

298
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,784
Oh, Harris.
See you in the morning?

299
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:24,453
Thank you.
Will bring aspirin.

300
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:28,499
- Ambulance here?
- They've just arrived, sir.
The men are coming in now.

301
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:40,577
- Almost finished?
- Yes, last plate.

302
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:45,446
I guess I'll have to quit. Pretty hard
to catch up with murderers these days, Mr. Chan...

303
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,383
especially when they don't
leave their signatures.

306
00:24:57,062 --> 00:25:00,225
Yes, fingerprints very valuable...

307
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,426
if detective can catch
owner of fingers.

308
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:07,665
That's right.
Found anything interesting?

309
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,832
As son Lee would say— play hunch.

Oh, there you are.
Come along with us.

- Yes.

more complete investigation.

Oh, very well. As you wish.
Baxter, prepare one of the bedrooms.

317
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,967
And you had better remain
here with Mr. Chan tonight.

- Oh, all— all night, ma'am?
- Certainly!

319
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,977
I'll send something over for your breakfast
in the morning, Charlie.

320
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:54,677
But what about your breakfast, ma'am?
Nobody knows how you like your toast but me.

321
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:59,655
I know how I like my toast.
Good night, Charlie.

Quiet little place, isn't it, sir?

323

Yes. Very restful.

Oh, yes, sir.

325
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:42,261

Then we can leave here at once, sir.
Should I pack your bags?

must first request able assistance...

in ancient house.

Ye—What do you mean, sir?

341
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,488
We investigate downstairs.

342

N-Now, sir?

343
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:22,589

Very practical spirit
to enter by door. Come.

That's all. And see

You said you were staying here

- Think advisable
Baxter take you home immediately.
- Hmm!

355
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,514
He's quite right, ma'am.

Very well.

360
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,930
Perhaps woman's intuition,

361
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:35,198
may help flight to truth.

362
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:37,137
That's settled.

Well, Charlie?

- May ask question, please?
- Anything you want to.

Phenomenon of music

00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:59,696
Nothing unusual about that.

368
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,757
That was merely a manifestation
from the world beyond.

369

No. They haven't

Very simple solution
of music from world beyond.

379
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:03,650
I can't believe
that Professor Bowan and Carlotta...

380
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:05,786

If Bowan has done this...

386
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:49,497
then all of our sיances
have been based on trickery.

387
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:51,700
When pilot unreliable...

- Quinine sulfate...

of ultraviolet lamp...

417

I gave Bowan
all the funds he asked for.

Suggest you go home now—

462
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:47,157
Uh, with Baxter.

463
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,500
Have something very important.

464
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,230
Would like your able assistance.

465
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,465
Of course,
if there's anything I can do.

466
00:37:56,574 --> 00:38:00,340
- Now, look here, Charlie. I want to know—
- Tomorrow, please.

467
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,811
- You go home now.
- Oh, very well.

468
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:06,348
- Come on, Baxter.
- Thank you.

469
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:15,989
- Observe anyone leaving house
when entering grounds?
- Not a soul.

470
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:19,688
- Ulrich admit you?
- No. The gates were unlocked.

471
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,033
Strange.

472
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:28,094
Someone very familiar
with ancient house...

473
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:30,901
fire gun from there.

474
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:33,568
I know this place inside and out.

475
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,646
It's a regular honeycomb
of passages...

476
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,271
that start everywhere
and end nowhere.

477
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:40,407
- You want me to show you?
- No.

478
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,349
Will investigate honeycomb later.

479
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:46,923
Maybe find bee.

480
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:48,992
Shall we go?

481
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,070
At present, much concerned
about Mrs. Lowell.

482
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,146
What do you mean?

483
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:12,511
Not so certain
gunfire directed at humble self.

484
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:15,050
You think the attempt
was made on <i>her</i> life?

485
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:19,020
Maybe. Suggest
you go to police at once.

486
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:22,024
Request guard for Mrs. Lowell
day and night.

487
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,094
I'll go immediately.

Ulrich's a queer old bird.

490
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,856
Have noticed Ulrich
not friendly to family.

491
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:55,152
May ask reason why?

492
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:58,387
Oh, Allen was engaged
to Ulrich's daughter.

493
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:01,954
After he left home, he broke with her,
and she committed suicide.

494
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,534
Ulrich held Allen responsible.

495
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:08,002

You were here yesterday

Yes.

502
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:09,028
Then if Allen Colby ring bell,
would have heard same?

503
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,863
Well, uh, I didn't hear him.

504
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:15,405
Strange someone
should climb over wall...

505

without first trying bell.

506
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:21,008
If someone were sneaking in here
to commit murder...

507
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:24,080
do you think they'd ring the bell
to let me know about it?

508
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:26,081
Correction, please.

509

Murderer would not
climb over wall near gate.

510

Allen Colby's face treated
with solution of quinine.

You knew about Allen Colby.

Now, where's Bowan?

576

He left just before you came in.

577
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:54,630
That's why you sent us in here.
You were covering up for him to make a getaway.

I want to be the first

You let the murderer of Allen Colby
slip right through your fingers.

583

I guess Morton's right. It must have been
Bowan who killed Colby...

last night.

01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:03,234
Believe have plan...

774
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:06,137
to secure much-desired confession.

775
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:19,183
I don't see why we should have been
called here for this morbid nonsense.

776
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:21,188
There's no use complaining about it.

777
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:24,851
[Muttering]
Why, you got no right to bring me into this.

778
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:26,929
Yes? Well, you're here, brother.

779
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:29,429
All right, Harris.
Come on inside.

780
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,898
- All set, Charlie.
- Thank you.

781
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:45,346
Please.

782
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:49,180
Request everyone
take same positions...

783
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:51,776
as on night of eventful sיance.

784
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:58,259
Oh, Harris. Stand by the door.
Have men in the hall.

785
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:01,057
- Be sure the outside of the house is covered.
- Yes, sir.

786
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:06,394
Pardon, please, inconvenience...

787
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:08,470
of bringing everyone here tonight.

788
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:11,472
Motive for recent murders...

789
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:14,839
like tangle of many strings...

790
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:18,903
ends of which held
by persons in this room.

791
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:23,117
First string held
by psychic mediums.

792

<i>Professor Bowan and Carlotta...</i>

<i>Had $ 100,000 endowment</i>
<i>to lose by change in will.</i>

795
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:38,127
Same change deprive Mr. Phelps,
administrator of estate...

796
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:40,702
<i>from handling large fortune.</i>

797
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:44,697
Have ascertained...

798
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:48,265

big losses in stock market.

<i>against Allen Colby</i>
<i>for tragedy to daughter.</i>

<i>who have everything to lose</i>
<i>if Allen Colby return to claim estate.</i>

803
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:14,893
Tonight, will try
very sincere experiment...

804
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:17,802
in effort to untangle motives.

805
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:21,968
Will call upon spirit world...

806
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:25,536
<i>for message from great beyond.</i>

807
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:29,083
Proceed, please.

808

Mr. Gage,
will you turn down the lights?

01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:44,827
We will pause a moment
in meditation.

812
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:58,947
I feel...

813
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:05,612
a presence... near.

814
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:10,116
<i>It is a woman.</i>

815
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:19,763
She is trying to come to us.

816
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:25,068
<i>Her image is becoming clearer.</i>

817
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:29,569
- [Mouthing Word]
<i>- Clearer.</i>

818
01:07:29,678 --> 01:07:31,805
<i>She is trying to speak.</i>

819
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,116
<i>She has a message...</i>

820
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:38,652
<i>- a message for</i>—
- Mother!

821

I have come back...

<i>the one who fears discovery...</i>

825
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:56,970
<i>the one who murdered</i>—

826
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:01,510
<i>- [All Shouting]</i>
<i>- [Phelps] Turn on the lights.!</i>
- [Morton] See that no one leaves this room.

827
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:15,821
Someone make very foolish mistake.

828
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,860
Throw knife
at spirit reflection in mirror.

829
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,899
May come out now.

830
01:08:26,302 --> 01:08:29,931
- Mrs. Lowell!
- Mother!
- Mother, darling!

831
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:32,769
- Oh, I'm so happy.
- Yes, dear.

832
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:35,742
You have to die to really find out
how much people miss you.

833
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:39,611
- But why did you do this?
- I'll let Charlie explain that, dear.

834
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:44,482
Sincerely hope explanation
will justify cause of anguish.

835
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:50,423
Person who throw this knife...

836
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:54,360
also kill Allen Colby
when he return to claim estate...

837

place body behind secret panel.

838
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:07,742
Then use ultraviolet-ray device...

839
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:11,244
to make body appear
as apparition at sיance.

840
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:16,881
Same murderer also try
to kill Mrs. Lowell...

841
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,011
on night of business conference...

Observe.
Both knives now missing.

847
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:40,566
As I stood up right here,
someone passed me in the dark.

848
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:43,577
I heard someone too.
It was you, Ulrich.

849
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,147
It wasn't!
I-I was over there near Mr. Morton.

850
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:48,273
- You went for that knife.
- I didn't, I tell you!

01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:59,959
- You are guilty man.
- I? You're crazy.

01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:01,620
<i>Contradiction, please.</i>

854
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:04,358
Took precaution
before sיance tonight...

855
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:06,798
to cover blade of knife
with graphite.

856
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:10,369
Telltale fingers sign confession.

857
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:13,305
Stand back! Everybody!

858
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:16,768

You commit murder in attempt...

863

to cover evidence of forgery
in Lowell accounts.

864

- Own act tonight convict you.
- All right, Harris.

865

Come on.

I know you had nothing
to do with it.

Very grateful for valuable assistance.

Believe that, tonight,
you practice deception for first time.

870

I wish I could say
the same for you, Bowan.

871
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:07,394
After all, I'm the one
who was imposed upon...

872
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:10,021

all charges against them.
