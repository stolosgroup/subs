2
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:43,789
<i>Based on actual events.
USSR, June 1985.</i>

3
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,521
It's uncommon to see welding and
not to hear its sound. I love her sound.

4
00:01:16,938 --> 00:01:18,439
Shykhshyhshyh?

5
00:01:20,232 --> 00:01:22,484
You're good at it.

6
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:25,654
Excellent welded.

7
00:01:28,615 --> 00:01:34,037
Only melted pieces remain on
metal. You see, they come to the opposite side.

8
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,206
I see.

9
00:01:36,581 --> 00:01:41,210
There is not much film left. Light, smile.
A pair of historical frames.

10
00:01:43,546 --> 00:01:45,255
You look great.

11
00:01:53,764 --> 00:01:58,644
Guys, let's round off already.
You are 4 hours 10 minutes in open space.

12
00:01:58,936 --> 00:02:02,439
- And what about the Earth?
- We will enter the zone in a couple of minutes.

13
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,733
We begin to gather slowly.

14
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,861
That's interesting,

15
00:02:08,153 --> 00:02:13,491
if one day one has to leave
Earth, can he live in space?

16
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:20,706
Continue your family, raise children,
find a livelihood, fall in love?

17
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:24,084
Make love in outer space.

18
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:28,171
Probably, someday and such
the experiment will be conducted by mankind.

19
00:02:30,257 --> 00:02:36,679
Invent some kind of simulator for
preparing cosmonauts for ... love

20
00:02:36,971 --> 00:02:41,058
"Cosmonaut Ivanov held a record
amount of time in the simulator »

21
00:02:41,475 --> 00:02:46,939
- Yes, there will be a new space record.
- Enough is enough.

22
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:51,651
So, fellow cosmonauts,
what kind of simulators are there?

23
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,864
By the way, you weld
in outer space.

24
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:59,284
Dawn, we're done. Going back.

25
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:03,121
So go back to the station.
What about oxygen?

26
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:05,290
There are 15 more minutes.

27
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:08,710
I thought we were out of communication.
It was awkward.

28
00:03:08,918 --> 00:03:14,382
I thought so too, but I decided to give
possibility of cosmonaut Lazareva

29
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,344
personally present the project
for management's consideration.

30
00:03:18,636 --> 00:03:22,598
The idea was accepted for consideration,
Next year we will start preparing.

31
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:28,644
Comrades, a woman for the first time in open space
- and she jokes, laughs, speaks of love!

32
00:03:28,895 --> 00:03:31,355
I would applaud the cosmonaut Lazareva.

33
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:34,275
In the MCC, by the way, she is already applauding.

34
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:37,695
- Ay!
- What's the matter?

35
00:03:40,614 --> 00:03:42,199
Light, freeze! Do not move!

36
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:46,537
- What happened?
- I pierced the glove.

37
00:03:50,249 --> 00:03:52,626
- Hold your hand, do not move.
- I am doing my best.

38
00:03:53,126 --> 00:03:57,838
Burr from welding through the glove
pierced. And sticks on both sides.

39
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,883
"What's the pressure?"
- It's falling.

40
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:02,509
You, the main thing, do not twitch.

41
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:06,847
"Volodya, can you cut the metal neatly?"
"It's already being done."

42
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,567
"How's the pressure?"
- 0.7 atmospheres.

43
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:21,319
Normal pressure. Hand come on.

44
00:04:22,404 --> 00:04:27,909
And let's go quietly,
as for a walk. As in the Arbat.

45
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:32,747
That's right, past the house of the book.
Opposite the restaurant is Prague.

46
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,959
We turn to the boulevard.
Light, talk to me

47
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,336
I'm talking with you...

48
00:04:38,586 --> 00:04:42,465
"Volodya, you do not have more than two minutes for everything."
- It's OK, we'll be in time.

49
00:04:43,215 --> 00:04:46,468
Well, recall how silver
according to Mendeleyev's table?

50
00:04:47,218 --> 00:04:49,846
- What?
- Silver on the table ...

51
00:04:51,014 --> 00:04:53,016
- Argentum.
"And mercury?"

52
00:04:53,474 --> 00:04:57,645
- Hydrargyrum.
- Right! I always confuse them with each other.

53
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:03,025
- Guys, I do not see you. Where are you?
- Getting close.

54
00:05:03,276 --> 00:05:05,528
We are going to the cinema?

55
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:08,489
Oh sure.

56
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:14,285
There are very few left.
We can go to the "Autumn Marathon".

57
00:05:15,244 --> 00:05:18,247
"Are you coming in?"
- Yes, we are.

58
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:26,590
- Do you like the Autumn Marathon?
- I Love ... "Autumn Marathon" ...

59
00:05:26,965 --> 00:05:30,260
Hold on, Light ... Hold on, dear ...

60
00:05:31,636 --> 00:05:33,555
That's all.

61
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:37,891
How's the pressure?

62
00:05:39,268 --> 00:05:40,894
Are you coming in?

63
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,983
Lazarev! Fedorov!
Are you online? Reception!

64
00:05:47,818 --> 00:05:51,821
Guys, are you inside or not yet?
What's happening?!

65
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:14,551
It's hard for me to explain this
from the point of view of the laws of physics.

66
00:06:19,764 --> 00:06:24,769
Vladimir Petrovich, you yourself
think how it looks from the outside.

67
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:28,939
Astronaut Lazarev almost died

68
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:32,609
from the fact that you saw the light,
and he eclipsed your consciousness.

69
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,777
If I write so in the report,

70
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:38,281
It will greatly affect your future
in the space detachment.

71
00:06:40,743 --> 00:06:42,870
Maybe they were angels?

72
00:06:44,496 --> 00:06:46,039
How do you like this answer?

73
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:51,503
Are you joking?

74
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:55,881
If I were joking, you would laugh.

75
00:07:51,224 --> 00:07:56,063
When you flew by the Soviet Union,
Have you thought about Olya and me?

76
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,606
Uh-huh.

77
00:07:58,274 --> 00:07:59,775
Everytime?

78
00:08:00,568 --> 00:08:01,944
Everytime.

79
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:04,905
What, 16 times a day?

80
00:08:06,407 --> 00:08:08,325
Even more.

81
00:08:09,368 --> 00:08:13,204
I did not think about you only,
when flying over Madagascar.

82
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:18,417
And what were you thinking about Madagascar?

83
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:27,217
I thought it would be if I was from outer space
I'll land in Madagascar.

84
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:34,182
Probably, the local Papuans will see,
as I fall, find me

85
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:38,477
and make the leader of his tribe.

86
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:46,193
And I'll tell them about space,
about the stars, about the universe ...

87
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:53,575
... and a little about what
I had a life in the USSR.

88
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,581
And what was your life like in the USSR?

89
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,209
Well, tell me.

90
00:09:33,237 --> 00:09:34,739
I love you.

91
00:09:37,325 --> 00:09:40,411
I want you back.
to life on Earth.

92
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm trying to.

93
00:09:55,466 --> 00:10:01,514
- How is it?
- Volodya, here is the Earth. Here, objects fall down.

94
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:06,894
- Let's go to.
- Wait, it's awkward ...

95
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:47,307
Something at me the signal was gone.

96
00:10:49,184 --> 00:10:51,061
Renouncement!

97
00:10:51,853 --> 00:10:54,773
The telemetry system does not work!

98
00:10:55,273 --> 00:10:58,276
- The temperature sensors cut down!
- And radio electronics too!

99
00:10:58,526 --> 00:10:59,986
The battery packs do not respond.

100
00:11:00,236 --> 00:11:04,866
I see, I see, the failure of all systems. Calmly,
without panic! Reboot the system.

101
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,336
"What could have happened to it?"
"The signal is gone."

102
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,214
"How much communication is there?"
- Three hours and almost six minutes.

103
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,132
Come with me. All with me!

104
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:26,135
Valera, photos from telescopes on Gagarin.

105
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,890
I can not see a damn thing. Either she, or not she.

106
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,436
- Maybe her Americans were shot down?
- Yeah, hell they're going to hit her ...

107
00:11:34,603 --> 00:11:37,147
And if this is their SDI, if
"Star wars" launched?

108
00:11:38,023 --> 00:11:39,398
You call the Ministry of Defense?

109
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:44,111
No, I want to cancel shish kebabs for tomorrow. So,
connect me with the Ministry of Defense!

110
00:11:52,285 --> 00:11:56,164
The Russians completely lost control
over its orbital space station.

111
00:11:56,373 --> 00:12:01,378
Salyut-7 turned into an unmanageable
a space object weighing 20 tons.

112
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:07,382
While no one can determine how long Soviet
The station will stay in orbit in this mode.

113
00:12:07,758 --> 00:12:12,471
According to experts in the near future
the station will begin to fall precipitously.

114
00:12:12,762 --> 00:12:17,851
When and where is the Soviet space
will the station drop to Earth?

115
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:21,813
There is a high probability that she
can fall on the United States,

116
00:12:25,024 --> 00:12:29,779
The fall of the station to the locality
will lead to numerous victims.

117
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,240
When falling to the ground, the station
can destroy a whole region.

118
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,826
We hope that the Russians themselves
will be able to solve their problems,

119
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:39,412
but we, too, will not waste time in vain,
we will develop our action plan ...

120
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:44,627
Comrade Shubin, how could this happen,
that in the midst of the Cold War,

121
00:12:44,835 --> 00:12:48,255
we, suddenly, lose the most important
a strategic object in space?

122
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,925
We, unfortunately, do not know yet,
what happened, we try to understand.

123
00:12:52,176 --> 00:12:56,304
If you do not know what happened, respectively,
you do not know what to do. This is true?

124
00:12:56,637 --> 00:12:59,640
We know what to do. You need to fly
to the station, and there already to understand.

125
00:12:59,932 --> 00:13:02,059
Well, when will you fly?

126
00:13:02,518 --> 00:13:05,813
The station will be in orbit for another three months.
We will prepare.

127
00:13:06,105 --> 00:13:09,149
"We do not have time for this."
- And what's the rush?

128
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:10,776
We received information,

129
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:14,696
that NASA has designated a start
Challenger for 30 number.

130
00:13:14,905 --> 00:13:17,282
That is, after 22 days.

131
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,493
Take a look.

132
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:26,331
This is our station Salyut-7.
Weight 20 tons. The size is 15 by 6 meters.

133
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:28,959
And this is the American shuttle "Challenger".

134
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:33,338
The size of the cargo area is 15 by 6 meters.
The capacity is 20 tons.

135
00:13:33,588 --> 00:13:35,674
Funny coincidence, is not it?

136
00:13:36,758 --> 00:13:39,386
And here's another funny coincidence.

137
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:45,684
This is the new member of the Challenger crew.
Our Frenchman Patrick De Bonel.

138
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,101
I flew with Fedorov to Salyut-7.

139
00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:53,398
Still friends with him, and even parcels
he sends it. With chestnuts and smelly cheese.

140
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:59,197
Patrick knows Salyut-7 as well
as our guys.

141
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:05,911
And if the Americans seize our
station, is that what will be, the invasion?

142
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,123
Not just an invasion.
We will have to answer.

143
00:14:09,456 --> 00:14:15,711
Valery Petrovich, you understand that we can not
allow the Americans to land at our station.

144
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:20,550
If you are not ready to fly, we
will be forced to knock it down with a rocket.

145
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:28,432
If you destroy it, then the fragments from this explosion will lead to
All satellites that are in orbit are out of order.

146
00:14:28,641 --> 00:14:31,393
We will lose space. Well, 10 years at least.

147
00:14:32,436 --> 00:14:35,898
We can not destroy the cosmos.

148
00:14:36,273 --> 00:14:40,359
Valery Petrovich, prepare the crew.

149
00:14:49,952 --> 00:14:52,454
Today marks fifteen years

150
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:56,708
Since the moment of entering the first orbit
space station "Salyut".

151
00:14:57,334 --> 00:15:02,923
Now a new modification of this station -
"Salyut-7" successfully works in near-earth orbit.

152
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:07,177
Her flight is on schedule
program in automatic mode

153
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:09,512
without the crew of astronauts.

154
00:15:09,888 --> 00:15:15,643
The whole system is monitored
from the Earth Center for Flight Control.

155
00:15:18,229 --> 00:15:21,858
The station rotates on two axes.
Approximately 1 degree per second

156
00:15:22,275 --> 00:15:26,863
- How can you dock with her then?
- Fedorov would have docked

157
00:15:27,488 --> 00:15:31,199
Manually docked only
Lazovoy, Fedorov, and Plakhov.

158
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:33,910
Astakhov has many hours of training.

159
00:15:34,202 --> 00:15:37,580
But why guess? It is necessary to plant
guys on the simulator,

160
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,167
and work out the docking
with a rotating station.

161
00:15:41,376 --> 00:15:42,877
Yes, we must try.

162
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:45,755
We call Valer, Fedorov?

163
00:15:46,088 --> 00:15:49,258
For Fedorov, the space is closed by doctors.

164
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,135
We try the rest.

165
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:57,640
- Something does not bite.
- Maybe the fish had a hibernation?

166
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:07,358
We must start warming up. And then I have
now, too, winter hibernation will begin.

167
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:08,818
It's with pleasure.

168
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:24,458
Victor Petrovich! Comrade Alyokhin!

169
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:28,086
We are looking for you everywhere, you
urgently call in the detachment.

170
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:30,505
Now!

171
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:36,928
"Well, we must get ready."
"Why do you need them so urgently?"

172
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:39,514
The medical commission must have passed.

173
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,267
Volod, pick up the fishing rod, please.

174
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,312
And what about the medical board did not say?

175
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:48,313
So what can I say?

176
00:16:48,605 --> 00:16:53,193
How many times have I been dragged to this
medical board, and then in duplicates.

177
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:58,990
- Thought I would be upset that they did not call me?
- To be honest, that too.

178
00:17:00,158 --> 00:17:01,868
You ohrenel, Vyt?

179
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:05,622
You decided that I would be upset,
that you are called, but I do not?

180
00:17:06,664 --> 00:17:08,666
Decided to pity me?

181
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:15,046
And you know, you're not an astronaut at all,
you were not even in outer space.

182
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,049
You're an engineer in a spacesuit.

183
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:36,568
Be healthy.

184
00:17:46,493 --> 00:17:48,203
- Hello, Vit.
- Kind.

185
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:54,251
- Listen, and what is your wife's time then?
"Thirty-one weeks and three days."

186
00:17:57,337 --> 00:17:59,047
- Four days.
- Four...

187
00:17:59,506 --> 00:18:00,757
Four days, yes.

188
00:18:01,925 --> 00:18:05,387
"So this is about to begin, is not it?"
- Yes.

189
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,266
Wow, we've transferred you from backups
in the main crew.

190
00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:13,018
Thank you.

191
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:17,105
We want you to fly to the Salute.

192
00:18:21,943 --> 00:18:24,404
- So I'm ready.
"Only this is not a planned flight."

193
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:26,573
- What happened?
- It happened, Vitya.

194
00:18:26,781 --> 00:18:30,410
We lost contact with the station.
We do not understand what happened to her.

195
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:33,328
You did it with your own hands,
so you know her better than anyone else.

196
00:18:33,537 --> 00:18:37,541
"And who is the commander?"
- And who would you like to fly with?

197
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:41,461
With Fedorov.

198
00:18:44,214 --> 00:18:49,803
Do not make sudden movements. Repeat the trajectory
movement of the docking unit. Well and further on sensations.

199
00:18:50,054 --> 00:18:53,057
Wahler, come on like this. Docking -
with you a bottle of cognac.

200
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:56,268
- Dock - from me a box.
- Have agreed.

201
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:11,740
We stick together ...

202
00:19:14,451 --> 00:19:15,369
Yes b ...

203
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:19,581
"Gene, try not so fast."
- Go.

204
00:19:35,345 --> 00:19:38,265
We modeled the visual
micromodel of station rotation.

205
00:19:38,515 --> 00:19:42,644
The ship will have to repeat exactly
the trajectory of the station's rotation and so to dock.

206
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:47,774
Theoretically, of course, this is possible,
but, I'm afraid, only theoretically.

207
00:19:49,566 --> 00:19:50,734
Come on, come on, come on...

208
00:19:55,489 --> 00:20:01,079
We remove one seat. Instead of him
in addition we load fuel, food, water.

209
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:06,250
In space, each gram is worth its weight in gold.
Less food, water, less oxygen.

210
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,378
And there will be fewer casualties, if that, yes?

211
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:18,428
Guys, well, it's impossible.

212
00:20:21,514 --> 00:20:25,142
No, Valery Petrovich, it will not work.

213
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:28,229
Imagine that you stop by the garage.

214
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:29,647
Here, it's going to be a car.

215
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:34,068
And the gate you first so,
then so, so, still so ...

216
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,844
You're more pampered with her, well,
as with a woman!

217
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,847
Valer, I'm with a woman who rotates
on all its axes, have not tried it yet.

218
00:21:06,263 --> 00:21:08,349
I'm not sure that someone will do it.

219
00:21:32,414 --> 00:21:35,208
Well, who is our next commander?

220
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,919
The commanders ended up with me.

221
00:21:41,047 --> 00:21:42,757
The entire detachment was tried.

222
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,867
Hello, Volod!

223
00:22:57,244 --> 00:22:59,246
"Oh, Valer, she's well."
- How are you?

224
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:03,583
- Nothing, nothing. How are you?
- Yes, it's okay like it.

225
00:23:05,126 --> 00:23:10,048
Heard, we have difficulties
with sending the crew to the "Salute"?

226
00:23:10,924 --> 00:23:14,927
Docking can not? I heard.

227
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:18,305
Do you think this is even possible?

228
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:22,017
- Does it rotate strongly?
- Strongly.

229
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:25,770
More degrees on all axes.

230
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:30,566
Valera, you're a pilot.
You know everything.

231
00:23:46,332 --> 00:23:51,712
Okay. Glad to see.
I'm going to teach young people.

232
00:23:53,464 --> 00:23:57,593
Volod, if you had to fly?

233
00:24:00,637 --> 00:24:02,389
Everything is complicated there ..

234
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:10,145
It fits me

235
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,068
Tomorrow morning to the medical board.

236
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,326
I will only replace one light bulb
and immediately back. At once.

237
00:24:24,534 --> 00:24:27,245
And someone else can not
to send a light bulb to change?

238
00:24:27,454 --> 00:24:29,831
I'm the best engineer. You know.

239
00:24:30,749 --> 00:24:34,334
You are deceiving me. The best engineer
Do not just send a light bulb change.

240
00:24:34,543 --> 00:24:37,879
- My little?
- You're hiding something.

241
00:24:39,423 --> 00:24:41,466
That's what I'm hiding from you, what?

242
00:24:42,384 --> 00:24:45,929
That something had happened there.
Something serious.

243
00:24:46,054 --> 00:24:49,600
That all refused to fly,
and only you, the fool, agreed.

244
00:24:50,976 --> 00:24:54,396
So ... Pregnant that you can not do?

245
00:24:54,688 --> 00:24:55,856
You can not be nervous.

246
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,900
- What are you doing?
- I'm nervous.

247
00:24:58,108 --> 00:25:02,695
Stop, please. Oh please.
Well, do not be nervous.

248
00:25:15,207 --> 00:25:18,085
Here, fly, take with you.

249
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,212
- Into the space?
- Yes.

250
00:25:20,504 --> 00:25:24,049
- Honey, well, we do not go skiing on skis.
- So, without talking!

251
00:25:26,008 --> 00:25:27,176
There is.

252
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:31,013
Two hats! Come here.

253
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,600
Give the menu, please.

254
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:44,985
- They say that Gorbachev introduces a dry law.
- Yes I know. I'm a little bit.

255
00:25:51,448 --> 00:25:52,908
For what we drink?

256
00:25:53,492 --> 00:25:55,953
I'm flying tomorrow to Baikonur with Vitya.

257
00:25:56,537 --> 00:25:57,996
Are you kidding?

258
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:02,710
- In a week into space.
- You're written off.

259
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:05,505
It happened.

260
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:11,594
They can not cope without me.
You need to manually join.

261
00:26:14,138 --> 00:26:17,474
Everything will be fine. Do not worry.

262
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:19,559
Come on, you know where!

263
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:24,230
Nin ...

264
00:26:28,776 --> 00:26:32,363
Tell me what's wrong with you
this cursed cosmos,

265
00:26:32,488 --> 00:26:35,741
on what did you exchange us with Olya?

266
00:26:47,794 --> 00:26:53,758
I confirm the readiness of the spacecraft to launch.
The spacecraft is switched to onboard food. Seventh.

267
00:26:53,966 --> 00:26:55,968
The report of the seventh was adopted, the first

268
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,096
First, there is a farm break
lateral blocks, the seventieth

269
00:26:59,305 --> 00:27:01,682
The report of the seventieth was adopted, the first

270
00:27:02,474 --> 00:27:05,477
Start is enabled.
Bleed one.

271
00:27:06,603 --> 00:27:09,063
Purge. Bleeding 2.

272
00:27:14,194 --> 00:27:15,487
The key to drainage.

273
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:17,614
Inflating.

274
00:27:18,115 --> 00:27:20,242
Earth-board. The mast has departed.

275
00:27:20,825 --> 00:27:22,786
- Start!
- Ignition!

276
00:27:23,787 --> 00:27:25,163
Preliminary.

277
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:27,957
Intermediate.

278
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:29,876
The main thing.

279
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,628
Climb!

280
00:27:48,518 --> 00:27:51,813
Good goes, beautiful!

281
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,324
How are the fluctuations?

282
00:28:04,741 --> 00:28:07,994
The oscillations persist.
The car goes rigidly, but surely.

283
00:28:08,244 --> 00:28:10,830
Tangazh, yaw, rotation - normal.

284
00:28:11,748 --> 00:28:14,917
Management System Parameters
the launch vehicle is normal.

285
00:28:15,251 --> 00:28:17,295
There is a reset of the DAS CAC.

286
00:28:17,837 --> 00:28:19,922
There is a department of the first stage.

287
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:22,675
There is switching off the engine of the side blocks.

288
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,094
There is a deactivation of the side blocks.

289
00:28:25,343 --> 00:28:27,263
Stabilization of the product is stable.

290
00:28:27,847 --> 00:28:32,309
Pamirs, and what is that you have there dangling?

291
00:28:34,561 --> 00:28:38,023
It's an Olympic bear, Dawn.
My daughter gave me.

292
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:42,652
- Talisman?
- Indicator of weightlessness.

293
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:46,490
For good luck!

294
00:28:48,533 --> 00:28:50,327
There is a branch of the head fairing.

295
00:28:50,535 --> 00:28:52,077
There is a department of the main stage.

296
00:28:52,286 --> 00:28:54,413
There is a shutdown of the main engine.

297
00:28:56,081 --> 00:28:58,166
There is a tail drop.

298
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:15,016
Well, guys, you're in orbit! Congratulations!

299
00:29:16,017 --> 00:29:17,934
Congratulations, Dawn!

300
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:05,272
Today at seven in the morning Moscow time, came out
into orbit the Soyuz-T-13 spacecraft.

301
00:30:05,606 --> 00:30:07,691
Daddy flew into the sky.

302
00:30:07,983 --> 00:30:12,111
The crew of the ship is to be carried out
docking with the orbital complex Salyut-7,

303
00:30:12,403 --> 00:30:14,905
carry out planned studies
and experiments

304
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:18,033
for the benefit of the world and all Soviet people.

305
00:30:18,826 --> 00:30:21,370
In the Khabarovsk kravo
Komsomol organization ...

306
00:30:38,802 --> 00:30:42,723
- I do not see her yet.
"She's still in the shadows."

307
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:48,979
Soon it should appear in about 90 degrees
right on the pitch and somewhere around 10 degrees in the yaw.

308
00:30:49,813 --> 00:30:50,940
We wait.

309
00:30:52,692 --> 00:30:53,734
Not yet ...

310
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:58,823
There she is. I can see it.

311
00:30:59,198 --> 00:31:02,784
Well, turn the ship around.
Let us take a look.

312
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:05,119
I'm taking aim.

313
00:31:13,002 --> 00:31:14,837
Here it is, dear.

314
00:31:15,921 --> 00:31:19,383
And we see.
Let's go quietly.

315
00:31:26,931 --> 00:31:30,977
1600 meters. Approximately through
5 minutes we will be at the station.

316
00:31:31,227 --> 00:31:35,147
Fly at a distance
Two hundred meters and there hang.

317
00:31:36,565 --> 00:31:37,566
There is.

318
00:31:54,749 --> 00:31:58,502
- Can we start to extinguish the speed?
"It's early yet."

319
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:17,063
Gashu the lateral speed.
I give 2 meters per second for braking.

320
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:21,983
Dawn, you see her?

321
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:26,613
We see.

322
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:29,699
Rotation by pitch approx.
1.5 degrees per second.

323
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:31,909
This is even faster than we expected.

324
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:37,331
Dawn, pay attention, solar panels
deployed in different directions.

325
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:40,459
Yes, we see.

326
00:32:41,294 --> 00:32:43,711
- Stepanovich?
- It's not clear yet.

327
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,213
Sash?

328
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:49,634
"We'll have to take pictures." Then we will analyze.
- We do.

329
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:55,723
Pamirs, with fuel more poetic.
There are no more than three attempts to join.

330
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,266
I understand you, Dawn.

331
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:02,271
- Still back on something you need to return.
- Yes. Well, with God?

332
00:33:04,106 --> 00:33:06,817
So, Pamirs, start docking!

333
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:09,944
Go.

334
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:47,856
"We're going to the mooring."
- I put forward the docking rod of the docking mechanism.

335
00:33:51,818 --> 00:33:54,195
The distance to the site is 32 meters.

336
00:34:07,624 --> 00:34:09,334
We go to the dock.

337
00:34:30,438 --> 00:34:32,148
Lead, crash!

338
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:03,302
No docking.

339
00:35:04,052 --> 00:35:07,097
- Lead, lead!
- I see, I'm taking them away, I'm taking them away! Calm down!

340
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:18,690
- Strongly collided?
- Not much. We almost braked.

341
00:35:19,024 --> 00:35:22,402
So, Pamirs, you are now
go into the radioten,

342
00:35:22,778 --> 00:35:27,074
rest better.
And we'll confer here, we'll think about it.

343
00:35:28,742 --> 00:35:30,035
Until the connection.

344
00:35:30,911 --> 00:35:32,746
"I understand you."
- There is.

345
00:35:33,163 --> 00:35:36,624
We'll take a look at it externally.

346
00:35:39,127 --> 00:35:44,549
So. If you start moving from 11 meters
at a speed of 35 centimeters per second,

347
00:35:44,841 --> 00:35:46,926
it will be exactly a quarter of a turn.

348
00:35:47,176 --> 00:35:50,179
And, in principle, we will be able to catch the knot.

349
00:36:03,484 --> 00:36:05,736
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying.

350
00:36:06,111 --> 00:36:09,656
I select the speed. You suggested it yourself.

351
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:14,076
- You can not go without a team.
- Nothing. We will rehearse a little.

352
00:36:15,327 --> 00:36:17,371
Did you hear what the earth said?

353
00:36:17,955 --> 00:36:21,292
"Let's do an external inspection of the station."
- I understood.

354
00:36:32,344 --> 00:36:35,389
By longitudinal station
rotates in one plane.

355
00:36:35,721 --> 00:36:39,808
Estimated docking speed
15 centimeters per second.

356
00:36:40,142 --> 00:36:45,314
This is not enough for the ship
adjust to the station and catch its rotation.

357
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:50,402
Let's try to catch the movement.

358
00:36:51,695 --> 00:36:53,572
Let's take a closer look, as they say.

359
00:36:54,782 --> 00:36:57,410
Recheck the readiness of the docking systems.

360
00:36:59,328 --> 00:37:04,040
This is just a rehearsal.
At the same time we'll take a closer look at the station.

361
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:10,672
So you do not need to reduce the speed, you need it
increase the opposite. A minimum of 3 times.

362
00:37:11,005 --> 00:37:13,049
At least to 35 centimeters per second.

363
00:37:19,263 --> 00:37:22,516
- Is the system ready?
- The system is ready for docking.

364
00:37:23,267 --> 00:37:24,852
Let's go quietly.

365
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:51,085
110 meters. The speed is 34 centimeters.

366
00:37:59,675 --> 00:38:01,302
Speed ??35.

367
00:38:03,929 --> 00:38:08,518
At this speed, if not coincide, slow down
just do not have time, and this is a guaranteed collision.

368
00:38:08,893 --> 00:38:12,731
35 ... We'll break the ship.

369
00:38:13,314 --> 00:38:16,359
We must return them, damn it.

370
00:38:19,528 --> 00:38:20,529
It's dangerous, Volodya!

371
00:38:20,737 --> 00:38:24,449
You understand, Vitya, every inch here
important. Literally every centimeter.

372
00:38:24,741 --> 00:38:29,788
A little left-right, up-down, forward-backward,
back and forth ... and not a fig. Do you know what I mean?

373
00:38:30,622 --> 00:38:33,124
"We're taking a risk, Volodya."
- Quietly, quietly, quietly ...

374
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,377
Well, dear, will we kiss?

375
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:38,796
Gashi. Gassy speed! We'll crack!

376
00:38:47,095 --> 00:38:50,432
There is a docking. There is a mehzahvat.

377
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:53,852
We begin the contraction. Victor!

378
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:04,278
Now let's calm down.
Why do we have to go around uselessly?

379
00:39:04,445 --> 00:39:06,155
You're crazy crazy!

380
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,283
We docked.

381
00:39:09,867 --> 00:39:12,869
I refuse to continue the flight
together with you, you hear!

382
00:39:13,494 --> 00:39:16,789
Whither, where will you get to?

383
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:33,265
Valery Petrovich! Valery Petrovich, connection.

384
00:39:41,605 --> 00:39:42,940
Pamirs, reception.

385
00:39:43,315 --> 00:39:45,859
Dawn, I'm Pamir-1. I hear you.

386
00:39:46,401 --> 00:39:49,321
- How are you feeling?
- Excellent.

387
00:39:50,906 --> 00:39:55,327
Pamirs, look. Generally,
we are here to consult ...

388
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:58,496
Earth, do you already have an image?

389
00:39:59,706 --> 00:40:00,748
Not yet.

390
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:02,666
We docked.

391
00:40:03,709 --> 00:40:04,960
I mean, did not you understand?

392
00:40:05,711 --> 00:40:10,340
Docking of the Soyuz-T13 and
station Salyut-7 produced successfully.

393
00:40:10,632 --> 00:40:11,967
The contraction is complete.

394
00:40:12,217 --> 00:40:15,220
Reported by the commander of the ship Pamir-1.

395
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:18,640
Your mother.

396
00:40:18,932 --> 00:40:22,435
Ready to test for leaks
and to the transition to the station.

397
00:40:22,644 --> 00:40:25,021
How do you hear me, Zarya? Reception.

398
00:40:27,315 --> 00:40:28,982
Well, guys, you give!

399
00:40:31,651 --> 00:40:35,906
And we were afraid.
And you need to change your shirt.

400
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:53,173
Pamirs, I congratulate you, you fellows.

401
00:40:53,548 --> 00:40:56,634
But let's somehow the next time together.

402
00:40:56,884 --> 00:41:00,471
- There is. Accepted.
"So, comrades, we are preparing for the transfer to the station."

403
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:22,408
We entered the docking station.

404
00:41:29,248 --> 00:41:32,000
Ready to go to the station.
Here is the order.

405
00:41:35,504 --> 00:41:36,546
Open the hatch?

406
00:41:36,713 --> 00:41:39,090
- Valery ...
- Wait a second.

407
00:41:41,926 --> 00:41:44,304
Vitya, you know, like in Georgian, well, wait?

408
00:41:45,638 --> 00:41:47,098
Wait, well!

409
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:52,645
- Pamirs, reception ...
"Dawn, welcome." The Pamirs are in touch.

410
00:41:53,021 --> 00:41:55,898
Pamir 1 does not enter, Pamir comes in. 2.

411
00:41:56,607 --> 00:41:58,609
Dawn, and what's the matter? Why can not I?

412
00:41:58,901 --> 00:42:03,906
- Can not. The Pamir comes in. 2.
- Guys, give it up. We go in together.

413
00:42:04,281 --> 00:42:06,826
Volod, if something happens to you,

414
00:42:07,034 --> 00:42:10,079
Vitya will not be able to drop the station into the ocean.

415
00:42:10,454 --> 00:42:13,581
This is a necessity,
which we must fulfill.

416
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:15,917
There is.

417
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:32,975
Close, Vov.

418
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:35,352
Come on.

419
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:50,949
Guys, if, with me, suddenly what will happen,
drown me in the Indian Ocean.

420
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:54,953
From childhood I dreamed to be there.
Coconuts, bananas ...

421
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,916
"Put off the coconuts!"
- There is.

422
00:42:58,374 --> 00:43:01,419
- Open the pottyhonechku.
- I'm opening it.

423
00:43:03,462 --> 00:43:05,547
Pamir 2, the pressure?

424
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:07,841
670 mm.

425
00:43:11,678 --> 00:43:13,138
Spits a little.

426
00:43:14,389 --> 00:43:17,433
The pressure drops.
I continue to open.

427
00:43:22,522 --> 00:43:25,566
550 mm. Continues to fall.

428
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,401
- Valera!
- A?

429
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:31,529
- Critical. It is necessary to close!
- To open? Open it!

430
00:43:31,696 --> 00:43:34,324
- Where to open ?! Close it!
- Vitya ...

431
00:43:36,826 --> 00:43:37,994
- Victor!
- Pamir - 2!

432
00:43:40,913 --> 00:43:45,042
Earth, Earth, I can not hear you.
My ears have been poured from a differential pressure.

433
00:43:47,086 --> 00:43:48,254
Pamir-2?

434
00:43:49,797 --> 00:43:54,343
"Where are you?"
- The Earth, I'm Pamir-2. I'm at the station.

435
00:43:56,386 --> 00:44:00,556
There is no depressurization. But there's ice all around.

436
00:44:01,265 --> 00:44:06,228
In the sense of? What do you mean?
What ice, Vitya?

437
00:44:09,231 --> 00:44:10,901
It is very cold in here.

438
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,613
And what about the instruments? What data?

439
00:44:17,949 --> 00:44:22,744
- On the manometer 530.
"Try the lights on."

440
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:28,083
Why are you silent? What is there with the light?

441
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:31,461
Pamir-1, Volodya? Reception

442
00:44:31,962 --> 00:44:34,923
Brothers, yes, there's a knockout.

443
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:38,593
"Volod, are you at the station?"
- Yes, I'm at the station.

444
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:43,014
- Well, what is it?
"She's all in the snow."

445
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:47,100
Do not understand. In what snow?
Are you laughing?

446
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:51,813
The most ordinary snow.
In places in a centimeter thick.

447
00:44:52,063 --> 00:44:54,441
Guys, but can you see the inside of the panels?

448
00:44:57,277 --> 00:45:02,657
Inside the panels is ice. This is not a station,
but a freezer.

449
00:45:02,949 --> 00:45:05,118
Where did the ice come from?

450
00:45:07,078 --> 00:45:09,080
It looks like "Spring" jerked.

451
00:45:10,706 --> 00:45:12,707
What is the temperature?

452
00:45:13,124 --> 00:45:16,628
Yes, the devil only knows.
The gradient is electronic.

453
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,087
Spit.

454
00:45:22,175 --> 00:45:25,262
"You're cold?"
"It's frozen."

455
00:45:25,929 --> 00:45:28,098
Where did you spit on the porthole?

456
00:45:28,515 --> 00:45:31,059
He spat at me. But I did not.

457
00:45:32,686 --> 00:45:36,732
So, Pamirs, listen to me carefully.
Fly while back on the ship and hang up.

458
00:45:37,107 --> 00:45:39,108
You did not sleep well for a day.

459
00:45:40,109 --> 00:45:41,360
There is.

460
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,950
Well, hello, home.

461
00:45:49,826 --> 00:45:52,704
"Welcome". Did you write?

462
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:55,540
No, Sveta wrote.

463
00:46:09,052 --> 00:46:11,722
Well, comrades, what thoughts?

464
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:16,309
- Yes, what thoughts can there be,
"It's not a station anymore, it's just scrap metal."

465
00:46:16,643 --> 00:46:19,562
The guys could have done it ...
but a matter of time.

466
00:46:19,729 --> 00:46:24,651
First they need to warm up the station and melt. And on
this, with the charge of one battery, will take at least 2 days.

467
00:46:24,859 --> 00:46:29,905
"When it melts, everything will be in the water, all the appliances."
"So they will dry it." The question is, how many?

468
00:46:30,113 --> 00:46:33,366
Well, even if they dry, and then
what? All the electronics to touch?

469
00:46:33,575 --> 00:46:37,246
There Alekhine. He this station
I collected my own hands!

470
00:46:37,455 --> 00:46:41,667
- There food for only 10 days.
- It's great that they do not have 10 days?

471
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:46,505
What 10 days? The station is below zero temperature!
They will not last so long.

472
00:46:46,755 --> 00:46:49,216
They will bask on the ship.
There plus twenty.

473
00:46:49,466 --> 00:46:52,761
Valery Petrovich, oxygen will come from
ship. Hence, the transition hatches will be open.

474
00:46:52,845 --> 00:46:55,721
With such a temperature difference,
the ship will cool very quickly.

475
00:46:55,888 --> 00:46:57,181
They will not last a week.

476
00:46:57,473 --> 00:47:00,142
What Russian peasant will frighten the frost?

477
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,770
"Valery Petrovich, you're Russian."
- Well?

478
00:47:03,229 --> 00:47:06,690
Now if you, the Russian peasant,
lock in your garage in the cold, in the winter

479
00:47:06,774 --> 00:47:10,819
without hot tea and with ice-cold food,
How much will you stretch?

480
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:14,198
Day? Five?

481
00:47:28,043 --> 00:47:29,753
Pamirs, reception.

482
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:33,215
Dawn, as you hear me, reception.
Good morning!

483
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:35,717
We here conferred and understood,
that the most correct decision,

484
00:47:35,926 --> 00:47:41,181
It is to throw the station into the ocean and
to bring you back to Earth.

485
00:47:42,307 --> 00:47:46,394
Dawn, but we are already here. Give us
work at least a couple of days.

486
00:47:46,603 --> 00:47:50,440
Yes, there are a couple of days that is not enough.
Too much risk.

487
00:47:56,487 --> 00:47:59,782
Valera, listen to me,

488
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:06,038
if you were in our place,
you would just be back home now, right?

489
00:48:08,457 --> 00:48:10,835
- "2 days".
- Valera,

490
00:48:14,921 --> 00:48:16,589
Pamirs, let's do it.

491
00:48:18,049 --> 00:48:19,592
You have five days.

492
00:48:20,134 --> 00:48:24,805
On the sixth, if we do not find a solution,
dump the station into the ocean

493
00:48:25,723 --> 00:48:27,266
and fly home.

494
00:48:28,476 --> 00:48:32,062
There is. Accepted. End of communication.

495
00:48:33,564 --> 00:48:37,776
This week it became known that
Russians are sending a rescue expedition

496
00:48:37,985 --> 00:48:40,153
to his dead station.

497
00:48:40,862 --> 00:48:45,449
"Has the air gone?"
- Come on! Breathes like in the mountains of the Caucasus!

498
00:48:45,866 --> 00:48:51,121
But the American specialists practically
sure that there is no chance to save the station.

499
00:48:52,289 --> 00:48:53,207
Creepy dope ...

500
00:48:53,499 --> 00:48:56,502
This requires a level of technology

501
00:48:56,668 --> 00:49:00,465
still not accessible to mankind.

502
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:02,175
Natasha, look,

503
00:49:03,218 --> 00:49:06,011
with each turn the temperature
on the ship falls to 0.2 degrees.

504
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:10,724
So that in all news there is information about
that our cosmonauts are doing well.

505
00:49:10,891 --> 00:49:14,477
Experts believe that the operation
Russian is doomed to failure.

506
00:49:14,811 --> 00:49:15,979
Today everything will be done.

507
00:49:16,312 --> 00:49:19,315
This means that the Soviet
cosmonauts will die.

508
00:49:19,691 --> 00:49:23,987
"But this is unlikely to convince the Americans."
- So, let them speak more convincingly.

509
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,366
Orbit station passes
across the entire territory of the United States.

510
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:32,327
It is possible that the Russians
the station may have weapons

511
00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:33,912
and, perhaps, even nuclear.

512
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,373
And then the consequences of this
falls can be comparable

513
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,459
with the explosion in Hiroshima.

514
00:49:39,709 --> 00:49:41,377
It might look like this ...

515
00:50:00,144 --> 00:50:04,816
Sergei Mikhailovich, the Americans are preparing
to launch an empty shuttle.

516
00:50:05,316 --> 00:50:08,236
Empty cargo hold. Empty flies.

517
00:50:13,742 --> 00:50:17,037
Dawn, you need a radiator directly
connect to a solar panel,

518
00:50:17,287 --> 00:50:19,247
turn to the sun,

519
00:50:19,456 --> 00:50:23,751
then we get an additional charge
and start heating the station.

520
00:50:24,209 --> 00:50:26,837
The volume of the station is 80 cubic meters.

521
00:50:27,087 --> 00:50:30,799
40 watts per meter in cube
will be 3.2 kilowatts.

522
00:50:31,049 --> 00:50:33,051
We will have a maximum of half.

523
00:50:33,844 --> 00:50:36,930
The day is at a minimum to
3 degrees warmed up.

524
00:50:37,389 --> 00:50:40,725
And above 5 it will not rise, unfortunately.

525
00:50:41,893 --> 00:50:44,729
Not Sochi, of course, but still.

526
00:50:49,274 --> 00:50:50,859
I'm starting the U-turn.

527
00:50:59,868 --> 00:51:01,536
Have jumped. Come to the left!

528
00:51:02,078 --> 00:51:05,748
We are in space! Where to the left?
For us? By the sun? On the batteries?

529
00:51:05,957 --> 00:51:09,961
Oh, of course, by the sun!
And slower, Vova.

530
00:51:10,878 --> 00:51:13,256
- Hush hush. Stop! Brake!
- I fixed it.

531
00:51:17,008 --> 00:51:19,386
Has earned. Try it.

532
00:51:24,098 --> 00:51:25,559
Fuck.

533
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:29,438
You see, engineer!

534
00:51:30,022 --> 00:51:31,482
In the spacesuit.

535
00:52:00,842 --> 00:52:02,511
Your mother.

536
00:52:04,095 --> 00:52:05,471
Handsomely.

537
00:52:10,934 --> 00:52:11,977
Cold.

538
00:52:21,027 --> 00:52:22,612
Let's try something.

539
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:30,370
Well ka. So effective.

540
00:52:35,248 --> 00:52:38,878
See that water on the ship does not
has flown in, it's all to hell.

541
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:40,421
We're watching.

542
00:52:42,673 --> 00:52:45,176
I'm on the attack, Victor on the gate.

543
00:52:45,593 --> 00:52:49,096
Blow off the water to the engine compartment,
then we will clean.

544
00:52:49,722 --> 00:52:52,725
Eh, we would like several
cleaners with rags.

545
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,561
With this, my brothers, it is taut, of course.

546
00:52:56,687 --> 00:53:00,356
And music is fun for the mood.

547
00:53:00,898 --> 00:53:03,276
Well, we'll organize the music for you right now.

548
00:53:03,609 --> 00:53:09,532
And about rags, you have there than to get hold of yourself:
kombezy, additional. clothes, well, and so on.

549
00:53:10,825 --> 00:53:13,619
Volod, and there is much water there in general?

550
00:53:14,703 --> 00:53:19,708
Valer, how can I tell you.
Uncensored quantity.

551
00:53:20,334 --> 00:53:22,877
Okay, and here's the music for you.

552
00:53:38,934 --> 00:53:44,898
"Wahler, is there anything else?"
- Come on, okay, we joked.

553
00:53:48,443 --> 00:53:51,321
- Oh, another matter.
"That's much better."

554
00:53:54,824 --> 00:53:56,242
- Volodya,
- Yes

555
00:53:56,451 --> 00:53:59,704
- Try to blow ventilation.
- Come on.

556
00:54:16,594 --> 00:54:18,221
Dry like.

557
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,562
Opa.

558
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:34,153
Victor! Lock the hatch, come on!
Come on! Lock the hatch!

559
00:54:48,708 --> 00:54:51,127
Pamirs, reception. Collected the water?

560
00:54:51,502 --> 00:54:55,965
Yes, almost collected. Only
all rags have already ended.

561
00:54:56,924 --> 00:54:59,343
Even personal things in the course allowed.

562
00:55:00,219 --> 00:55:02,096
Is it warm on the ship?

563
00:55:02,513 --> 00:55:07,184
Well, warmer than at the station.
Tolerant, in general.

564
00:55:07,601 --> 00:55:10,854
Do not forget to measure the temperature
and drink vitamins.

565
00:55:11,229 --> 00:55:13,273
Good good. Do not forget.

566
00:55:38,338 --> 00:55:40,256
Look, do not burn your hands.

567
00:55:57,981 --> 00:56:02,360
- How many do you have?
- Yes, 36.6.

568
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:10,576
- And you have?
- As many.

569
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:30,929
Look, see how there between
bags over the sofa,

570
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:33,432
is there what?

571
00:56:54,743 --> 00:56:59,539
- Good joke.
- And you open it, open it.

572
00:57:11,259 --> 00:57:13,094
How did you carry it?

573
00:57:13,553 --> 00:57:17,097
You fly from mine, you can donkey
in space to take.

574
00:57:17,597 --> 00:57:19,266
Stunned.

575
00:57:21,393 --> 00:57:25,730
Well, on a small? For warming.

576
00:57:48,669 --> 00:57:54,675
"On Earth, it's a dry law."
- The same on Earth. It does not apply to us.

577
00:57:55,926 --> 00:57:58,512
We are still on the territory of the USSR.

578
00:58:01,932 --> 00:58:04,726
Outside the window, like, the police do not fly.

579
00:58:08,354 --> 00:58:10,022
And the truth does not fly.

580
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:13,567
Well then, give one more.

581
00:58:28,331 --> 00:58:31,501
Volod, you see no one but us?

582
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:35,796
Cockroach. The first in space.

583
00:58:36,296 --> 00:58:39,216
And I already thought everything, carbon dioxide
breathing in, glitches have begun.

584
00:58:39,341 --> 00:58:41,010
Also what with it to do?

585
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,267
On Earth, I would have crushed it.

586
00:58:48,976 --> 00:58:52,188
It's a pity after all, fellow countryman.

587
00:58:55,358 --> 00:58:58,651
Well, fellow countryman, will you be third?

588
00:59:04,157 --> 00:59:07,952
Stepanich, what are we fighting for, eh?

589
00:59:09,954 --> 00:59:12,123
Why do we risk children.

590
00:59:12,999 --> 00:59:17,503
It's a piece of iron.
20 tons of iron and all.

591
00:59:17,795 --> 00:59:20,839
This is the reputation of Soviet cosmonautics.

592
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,803
Vova Komarov,

593
00:59:28,888 --> 00:59:32,141
Yura Dobrovolsky, Vitya Patsayev,

594
00:59:33,017 --> 00:59:36,312
Vladik Volkov. I remember
about them every day.

595
00:59:38,022 --> 00:59:43,027
Every time I think we should
were made to return them.

596
00:59:45,154 --> 00:59:49,074
- Here's the reputation.
- Then, we could not do anything.

597
00:59:51,701 --> 00:59:55,622
And now I do not understand. What I should do?

598
00:59:56,206 --> 01:00:00,585
I'm not there. I do not see what they see.

599
01:00:01,753 --> 01:00:03,546
I can only hear them.

600
01:00:05,381 --> 01:00:10,178
20 minutes every half hour.
And then with interference.

601
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:14,140
You can make the right decision.

602
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:16,725
Bring them back.

603
01:00:18,059 --> 01:00:19,936
Is this the right decision?

604
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:25,733
They are the best guys.

605
01:00:26,609 --> 01:00:29,612
They are created for the cause,
which is now being done.

606
01:00:30,405 --> 01:00:32,448
And this concerns their honor.

607
01:00:34,325 --> 01:00:36,327
And the honor of their country.

608
01:00:36,786 --> 01:00:40,664
And then it's not just 20 tons of metal.

609
01:00:45,335 --> 01:00:49,464
"Pamirs, do you hear me?"
"Dawn, welcome." We hear you.

610
01:00:50,089 --> 01:00:51,382
How are you?

611
01:00:51,758 --> 01:00:54,677
We clean the components of electric circuits.

612
01:00:56,178 --> 01:00:57,972
How much more water is left?

613
01:00:58,389 --> 01:01:01,392
Yes, it comes out from all angles.

614
01:01:02,351 --> 01:01:04,728
We catch it by drop.

615
01:01:06,856 --> 01:01:11,443
- Pamirs, and you rested?
- Yes. Yes, they rested.

616
01:01:12,152 --> 01:01:18,659
So, go to the ship
and hang up. Without rest it is impossible, children.

617
01:01:18,992 --> 01:01:22,245
Not until the rest, Valer. You would have seen,
that here it is created.

618
01:01:22,496 --> 01:01:26,499
While the water is not understood,
it is better not to stop.

619
01:01:27,709 --> 01:01:29,085
That's an order.

620
01:01:29,586 --> 01:01:35,882
- Good. Only the chains will ring and immediately
... - Guys, and how did CSKA play?

621
01:01:36,174 --> 01:01:41,429
What CSKA? And, we'll find out the account.

622
01:01:42,806 --> 01:01:44,182
- Valery Petrovich ...
- A little bit later.

623
01:01:44,391 --> 01:01:48,853
Valery Petrovich! They both have a temperature
under 38, it's time to start antibiotics prick.

624
01:01:49,062 --> 01:01:53,399
And be sure to have a hot tea, you hear me! Them
you need at least a day not to leave the warm ship.

625
01:01:53,608 --> 01:01:55,777
My dear, they have nothing left.

626
01:01:55,944 --> 01:02:00,614
Now they chain will ring, and all they will have - and tea
hot, and warm, and half board, and Sochi - everything will be!

627
01:02:00,822 --> 01:02:04,743
- Do you even understand what is at stake?
- Yes, I understand.

628
01:02:18,924 --> 01:02:20,217
Take it.

629
01:02:28,808 --> 01:02:33,687
Now the battery is connected to solar
batteries, and start the station.

630
01:02:37,066 --> 01:02:40,861
- There is a contact.
- Has a reorientation begun?

631
01:02:41,278 --> 01:02:45,991
Now the sensor is trying to find the sun.
To make the batteries unfold to him.

632
01:02:49,453 --> 01:02:51,787
Do you hear, did the gear go for a turn?

633
01:03:14,142 --> 01:03:15,935
I can not hear.

634
01:03:26,403 --> 01:03:27,988
Sorry the recorder does not work ...

635
01:03:28,196 --> 01:03:30,282
Inside everything is fine.

636
01:03:30,532 --> 01:03:34,745
I say, we must go out into space
doing external inspection.

637
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:45,379
At the next communication session
Pamir-1 comes out, get ready.

638
01:04:03,355 --> 01:04:06,400
He opened the hatch. The pressure is normal.

639
01:04:07,234 --> 01:04:08,317
Excellent.

640
01:04:10,861 --> 01:04:12,738
So, I'm outside.

641
01:04:13,114 --> 01:04:19,411
The station photo shows minor distortions
The shape of the sensor orientation of solar cells.

642
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:21,705
Start checking with him.

643
01:04:22,373 --> 01:04:25,584
Accepted. I'm starting to move.

644
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:31,631
- Get around the middle battery on the left.
"I understand, I walk around to my left."

645
01:04:33,216 --> 01:04:36,051
And here nothing has changed. Everything is familiar.

646
01:04:36,343 --> 01:04:40,764
- The same Earth, the same Sun?
- Yes, all the same.

647
01:04:44,227 --> 01:04:49,148
Batteries are worn out, of course, strongly.
Like sails after a circumnavigation.

648
01:04:50,942 --> 01:04:55,947
Well, cosmic dust is normal.
It is necessary to replace. Volod, move to the sensor.

649
01:04:56,572 --> 01:04:58,491
I understand you, I'm moving.

650
01:05:00,241 --> 01:05:04,078
The body of the station is corroded.
Aging, beautiful.

651
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:08,791
It's too early for her to grow old.
Where are you, above the control room?

652
01:05:09,917 --> 01:05:12,462
Yes, I turn to the body of the working compartment.

653
01:05:13,004 --> 01:05:16,882
"Can you see the sensor already?"
"Not yet, I'm moving to him."

654
01:05:17,633 --> 01:05:20,970
"Are you watching the pressure?"
- Yes, it's normal.

655
01:05:33,272 --> 01:05:35,900
- Dawn, it's all clear.
"Well, have you found it?"

656
01:05:36,317 --> 01:05:41,322
Found. It seems that I found.
Vitya, you were right.

657
01:05:41,614 --> 01:05:42,573
What, sensor?

658
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:49,038
Yes. Battery orientation sensor housing
bent. Pressed against the surface of the station.

659
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:54,750
How could this happen?

660
01:05:55,126 --> 01:05:59,631
- Traces are there?
"What about without them, Sash!" You would have seen it.

661
01:06:00,006 --> 01:06:04,386
Scratch your finger in three thicknesses to the sensor.

662
01:06:05,387 --> 01:06:06,429
Asteroid?

663
01:06:06,846 --> 01:06:11,768
Well, what else could it be?
It looks like the truck drove in.

664
01:06:12,227 --> 01:06:13,937
And it will turn out?

665
01:06:14,229 --> 01:06:18,398
Unscrew, I'm afraid, will not work.
You can not get close to the nuts. They are pressed.

666
01:06:20,066 --> 01:06:21,651
And if you beat her off?

667
01:06:21,735 --> 01:06:25,488
Guys, there's a thick metal,
you can not beat him like that.

668
01:06:26,573 --> 01:06:30,410
Let the technicians repeat the same
position of the sensor on the layout.

669
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:31,870
I'll do it now.

670
01:06:32,871 --> 01:06:34,122
Okay, guys,

671
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:37,959
it's good that they found the reason.

672
01:06:39,001 --> 01:06:43,088
We will think what to do.
Come back for now.

673
01:06:43,505 --> 01:06:47,717
I would stay here for now. I would have examined the station.

674
01:06:48,218 --> 01:06:52,347
I have enough oxygen, which I will
go here to run, the atmosphere to waste.

675
01:06:52,931 --> 01:06:56,642
And while you are thinking about the next
session decide what to do.

676
01:06:57,185 --> 01:06:59,187
Confirm the connection, the reception.

677
01:06:59,854 --> 01:07:01,564
Pamir, can you hear me?

678
01:07:06,902 --> 01:07:11,115
Dawn, dawn, I'm Pamir-1, reception.

679
01:07:11,991 --> 01:07:16,495
Vitya, have you lost the Earth, too?
Victor, answer me, reception.

680
01:07:17,913 --> 01:07:21,708
Pamir-2, I'm Pamir-1,
how do you hear me, reception?

681
01:07:30,592 --> 01:07:33,803
Victor! Pamir-2!

682
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:36,263
Victor.

683
01:07:40,267 --> 01:07:42,853
Dawn, we have smoke at the station!

684
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,398
Victor! Victor!

685
01:07:56,783 --> 01:07:59,452
Dawn, we have a fire on the ship!

686
01:08:00,328 --> 01:08:04,247
Victor, Vitya, put on your spacesuit! Obgorish!

687
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:09,294
Victor! Dock the ship for fuck!
Close the hatch and shoot!

688
01:08:09,336 --> 01:08:16,259
Shooting until the station caught fire!
Hold on! Hold on.

689
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:27,812
Victor!

690
01:08:56,172 --> 01:08:57,172
Victor!

691
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:06,614
Come out come on.

692
01:10:12,118 --> 01:10:18,082
- Why are not you sleeping?
- I'm fine, but why are you awake?

693
01:10:44,982 --> 01:10:50,447
Pamirs, reception. How do you hear me?
This is the Earth, answer.

694
01:10:51,739 --> 01:10:53,449
Pamirs, reception.

695
01:10:54,492 --> 01:10:57,286
Volodya, Victor. How do you hear me?

696
01:10:57,453 --> 01:11:00,456
Valery Petrovich, station in the shade,
there is no connection.

697
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:06,920
Well, comrades, it's time.
It's time to decide something ...

698
01:11:08,838 --> 01:11:12,842
- We will wait for the next communication session.
- We have been waiting 8 hours.

699
01:11:13,635 --> 01:11:16,429
Because of your haste, we are without
training flew,

700
01:11:16,596 --> 01:11:19,891
so now we will wait
as much as we need, okay?

701
01:11:20,641 --> 01:11:24,020
Do you think that I do not know what it is
you left the astronauts at the station,

702
01:11:24,186 --> 01:11:27,772
when he could and should return them!
It's you who ditched them!

703
01:11:28,189 --> 01:11:29,649
Stop it!

704
01:11:30,525 --> 01:11:33,569
I'll see, I'll make sure
you answered for all this!

705
01:11:33,861 --> 01:11:36,531
And I will not look at the fact that you
Hero of the Soviet Union!

706
01:11:36,697 --> 01:11:40,201
Twice a hero.
And if necessary, I will answer.

707
01:11:41,118 --> 01:11:42,286
You answer.

708
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:50,544
CNN broadcast the launch
American Shuttle.

709
01:11:50,794 --> 01:11:52,630
Display on the big screen?

710
01:11:53,254 --> 01:11:56,257
Have we seen their Shuttles take off?

711
01:11:57,675 --> 01:12:00,262
So, in places. We are waiting for communication.

712
01:12:20,447 --> 01:12:23,241
Vםt, how are you there?

713
01:12:26,078 --> 01:12:29,873
The shuttle flew up the American shuttle.

714
01:12:32,417 --> 01:12:36,087
Oh, Vitya, Vitya, you're not lightly sunburned ...

715
01:12:46,012 --> 01:12:48,014
Yes, yes, we check.

716
01:12:48,682 --> 01:12:56,481
Apogee 52 555 Perigee 25 554
Room temperature 0

717
01:12:57,232 --> 01:13:02,153
- Temperature of the instrument compartment ...
- Dawn, I'm Pamir-1. Do you hear me?

718
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:06,240
- Dawn,
- Pamirs, reception.

719
01:13:06,407 --> 01:13:09,410
- this is Pamir 1.
"Pamirs, welcome!" The Pamirs are in touch!

720
01:13:09,702 --> 01:13:11,411
Pamirs, reception, we listen to you!

721
01:13:13,164 --> 01:13:15,124
"Welcome, Volodya!"
- Yes, Valera.

722
01:13:15,374 --> 01:13:18,460
What's wrong with you? You were not connected for 9 hours.

723
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:21,797
We had a fire. The ship was burnt.

724
01:13:22,381 --> 01:13:25,634
Vitya extinguished it by depressurization.
We're at the station now.

725
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:28,720
- How is he? What about Vitya?
- Scorched heavily.

726
01:13:29,054 --> 01:13:32,724
"Is he conscious?"
- Yes, in the mind. Only the smoke heavily inhaled.

727
01:13:32,974 --> 01:13:35,977
"Can you get on the ship and report the situation?"
- I can.

728
01:13:36,894 --> 01:13:38,103
I'm worried about Vitya.

729
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:43,066
Vladimir Petrovich, Pamir-2
2 capsules of MP-24 and one BK-12.

730
01:13:43,275 --> 01:13:44,526
Repeat after 6 hours.

731
01:13:44,818 --> 01:13:48,447
OK I understood. Valer, in general, so ...

732
01:13:49,072 --> 01:13:51,533
The oxygen supply station is burned out.

733
01:13:51,825 --> 01:13:54,161
Most likely, the saber caught fire.

734
01:13:54,536 --> 01:13:59,332
The ventilation system also does not work.
There is nothing to breathe. There is almost no air.

735
01:13:59,749 --> 01:14:02,543
Look, on the ship though
anything works?

736
01:14:03,836 --> 01:14:08,840
So, I'm checking. Central unit
data does not reflect.

737
01:14:11,343 --> 01:14:13,678
The ship does not react to commands.

738
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:18,975
- Is the wiring fused too?
"Valer, everything is melted here."

739
01:14:21,102 --> 01:14:26,108
Everything is not very good. I'm afraid that
You can not dump the station into the ocean any more.

740
01:14:26,442 --> 01:14:28,651
The ship is now unmanageable.

741
01:14:29,485 --> 01:14:30,820
Understand you.

742
01:14:34,532 --> 01:14:37,410
Now we will think how
you to return to the land.

743
01:14:38,744 --> 01:14:41,789
We can not allow Americans
to our station.

744
01:14:41,997 --> 01:14:43,624
I agree.

745
01:14:43,833 --> 01:14:45,834
We know what they need.

746
01:14:46,252 --> 01:14:50,547
It is impossible to let Americans
Our advanced technologies have fallen into the hands.

747
01:14:51,256 --> 01:14:55,301
So, we will shoot down the station before,
how the Americans will fly to it.

748
01:15:00,055 --> 01:15:04,560
Comrades, do you remember, in general,
that there are two of our astronauts?

749
01:15:04,977 --> 01:15:07,104
And what can you do?

750
01:15:12,693 --> 01:15:14,611
Give me three hours.

751
01:15:25,871 --> 01:15:30,417
- Has the control unit been opened?
- Opened it! Everything is melted here.

752
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:34,421
Bad. Disconnect everything,
until the batteries have sat down.

753
01:15:34,671 --> 01:15:35,922
It is done.

754
01:15:46,641 --> 01:15:48,685
- You heard?
- What?

755
01:15:53,106 --> 01:15:54,983
Did you hear the sound of the docking?

756
01:15:57,985 --> 01:15:59,695
Wait, you what, what docking?

757
01:15:59,862 --> 01:16:02,657
We must open the hatch, the shuttle docked.

758
01:16:03,324 --> 01:16:03,991
Whatever ...

759
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:07,953
American ship! I saw him
flying. He will help us, bring us back to earth!

760
01:16:08,037 --> 01:16:10,289
Vitya, are you crazy? He can not
to us to dock!

761
01:16:10,414 --> 01:16:11,539
He docked.

762
01:16:11,789 --> 01:16:14,667
Victor, stop it! There is nothing there,
you can not open the hatch!

763
01:16:14,876 --> 01:16:17,295
Let go! I heard the sound of docking.

764
01:16:17,503 --> 01:16:18,713
You have misunderstood it!

765
01:16:18,963 --> 01:16:24,301
This is a glitch! This is from lack of oxygen and from
obezbalivajushchego, that I have pierced you.

766
01:16:24,552 --> 01:16:27,847
Let go, you bastard! It's you
to die here flew,

767
01:16:28,055 --> 01:16:31,600
but I want to live! On Earth, you hear!

768
01:16:45,237 --> 01:16:48,991
"Do not touch the pen!" Do not touch!
- Let go!

769
01:16:49,366 --> 01:16:52,370
"There's no one there!"
- Let go, you bastard! Let go!

770
01:16:52,662 --> 01:16:55,957
You have misunderstood it! It happens.

771
01:16:56,458 --> 01:17:02,213
I also thought that the angels,
but there were no angels.

772
01:17:05,465 --> 01:17:09,553
And remember ... remember you brought chestnuts?

773
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:11,054
I remember.

774
01:17:11,763 --> 01:17:16,434
And what is in them such, I do not understand.
Potatoes are like potatoes.

775
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:19,312
Yes, I did not understand myself.

776
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:42,709
Technically undock
a ship by hand is possible.

777
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:45,837
There are pyrobolts. The team is mechanical,
there is no binding to electronics.

778
01:17:45,962 --> 01:17:47,338
And how much will they fall?

779
01:17:47,547 --> 01:17:49,632
Now they are at an altitude of 180 km perigee.

780
01:17:49,799 --> 01:17:54,594
Through four turns they will cross the conventional boundary
with the atmosphere and will begin to fall precipitously.

781
01:17:56,304 --> 01:17:57,764
And when they land?

782
01:17:58,014 --> 01:18:01,350
In 67 hours and forty minutes.
With an error of 20 minutes.

783
01:18:01,517 --> 01:18:02,811
The place of the fall?

784
01:18:03,103 --> 01:18:05,772
Tentatively - here in this area.

785
01:18:06,064 --> 01:18:10,068
"What does it mean in this area, it's the entire Indian Ocean!"
- It is not possible to calculate precisely.

786
01:18:10,235 --> 01:18:13,655
"Valery Petrovich, they can not reach the ground."
- Why?

787
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:17,325
To restore the atmosphere at the station
they used almost all the oxygen.

788
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:20,953
Look, there are 5 cylinders left.
with oxygen for 4 hours - this is for 20 hours.

789
01:18:21,161 --> 01:18:23,914
Plus large air tanks
mixture is at 40

790
01:18:24,039 --> 01:18:27,918
And in gas masks 8 more hours.
Total 68 hours is in general.

791
01:18:28,043 --> 01:18:30,170
For 34 hours for each.

792
01:18:30,670 --> 01:18:32,214
How much do they lack in the end?

793
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:34,132
The same amount. And no more ...

794
01:18:34,341 --> 01:18:38,136
What do you mean no! Which means no,
then we think! We think!

795
01:18:38,345 --> 01:18:42,807
We communicate with the Pamirs, we search everywhere.
In every used cylinder!

796
01:18:43,141 --> 01:18:46,059
Every breath of air,
every molecule of oxygen!

797
01:18:46,268 --> 01:18:49,354
Valera, we checked everything.

798
01:18:49,604 --> 01:18:52,065
We can only return one person.

799
01:18:52,357 --> 01:18:55,360
And that is not guaranteed.
They have too little oxygen.

800
01:18:59,698 --> 01:19:02,742
"One will be enough for one."
- What did you say?

801
01:19:02,951 --> 01:19:04,744
They have 8 ampoules omnopon.

802
01:19:04,869 --> 01:19:08,247
It depresses breathing and slows down
oxygen consumption.

803
01:19:08,456 --> 01:19:10,333
One can definitely be returned.

804
01:19:20,009 --> 01:19:21,802
That's just who to return?

805
01:19:21,969 --> 01:19:26,640
The commander must remain on the ship.
Such an order.

806
01:19:30,394 --> 01:19:33,981
It is necessary to undock exactly
at 17 hours, 34 minutes, 40 seconds

807
01:19:34,398 --> 01:19:39,193
It is necessary to tell them now.
Otherwise they will not have time to prepare.

808
01:20:01,506 --> 01:20:03,841
Sash, connect me in the office.

809
01:20:31,117 --> 01:20:35,413
Volod, Vyt, can you hear me?

810
01:20:36,456 --> 01:20:39,167
Dawn, I'm Pamir-1, we hear you.

811
01:20:41,252 --> 01:20:42,628
How is Vitya?

812
01:20:43,629 --> 01:20:45,089
In the mind.

813
01:20:45,756 --> 01:20:47,091
He hears us?

814
01:20:48,134 --> 01:20:49,635
No, he does not.

815
01:20:50,761 --> 01:20:53,806
There is no time, I'm short.

816
01:20:54,723 --> 01:20:56,641
You have little oxygen.

817
01:20:57,475 --> 01:21:00,561
You can return only one to the ground.

818
01:21:00,811 --> 01:21:02,271
Do you hear me?

819
01:21:04,106 --> 01:21:05,274
Yes, I do.

820
01:21:05,858 --> 01:21:07,485
Collect all the oxygen

821
01:21:07,651 --> 01:21:11,447
and undock Alyokhin exactly
at 17 hours, 34 minutes, 40 seconds.

822
01:21:11,614 --> 01:21:13,073
How did you understand me?

823
01:21:14,074 --> 01:21:15,951
I understood you. Will be fulfilled.

824
01:21:16,201 --> 01:21:22,039
It will land in the Indian region
of the ocean. The cruiser had already gone there.

825
01:21:24,959 --> 01:21:31,465
- And how did CSKA play?
- I won from Spartacus. 2: 1.

826
01:21:32,675 --> 01:21:33,967
It's good.

827
01:21:37,513 --> 01:21:39,514
Well, see you then.

828
01:21:41,768 --> 01:21:42,894
Volod,

829
01:21:44,395 --> 01:21:46,105
forgive me.

830
01:22:37,278 --> 01:22:40,613
And what were you thinking about Madagascar?

831
01:22:41,364 --> 01:22:45,409
I thought it would be if I
from space will land on Madagascar?

832
01:22:46,035 --> 01:22:50,539
Probably, the local Papuans will see
as I fall, they will find me,

833
01:22:52,041 --> 01:22:54,419
and make the leader of his tribe,

834
01:22:55,879 --> 01:23:01,593
but I'll tell them about space,
about the universe, about the stars,

835
01:23:04,137 --> 01:23:08,140
and very little what I have
there was life in the USSR

836
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:13,228
And what was your life like in the USSR?

837
01:23:15,063 --> 01:23:16,856
Well, tell me.

838
01:23:19,984 --> 01:23:24,989
Daughter, wife, football

839
01:23:26,366 --> 01:23:28,785
and the building of communism.

840
01:23:29,911 --> 01:23:33,038
Yes, it sounds very boring.

841
01:23:34,623 --> 01:23:39,127
Compared to the view from space
on the African continent.

842
01:23:41,629 --> 01:23:43,798
But I love it all.

843
01:24:03,942 --> 01:24:05,193
Nina!

844
01:24:07,279 --> 01:24:09,782
- Hi!
- Hi.

845
01:24:11,241 --> 01:24:12,451
Hey.

846
01:24:17,372 --> 01:24:19,124
Something happened?

847
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:22,126
You need to talk to him.

848
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:35,847
Now...

849
01:24:42,687 --> 01:24:44,689
"Hello, Nin.
- Hi.

850
01:24:46,524 --> 01:24:51,320
- There they have problems, and we decided to give you
opportunity ... - I know everything. When is the connection?

851
01:24:51,904 --> 01:24:54,489
They are in touch. Let's go to?

852
01:25:14,549 --> 01:25:15,842
The Pamirs,

853
01:25:16,843 --> 01:25:20,473
- Guys, Pamirs
- Yes, Dawn, welcome.

854
01:25:23,225 --> 01:25:27,605
Volodya, Nina is here.
I want to talk to you.

855
01:25:48,332 --> 01:25:53,462
"Nina, can you hear me?"
"Yes, I hear you."

856
01:25:56,298 --> 01:25:58,383
Thank you for coming.

857
01:26:01,094 --> 01:26:06,348
- How is Olya?
- She is here. She wants to talk to you.

858
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:09,143
Dad, hello, where are you?

859
01:26:10,686 --> 01:26:15,190
"Hello, daughter."
- Dad, hello, where are you?

860
01:26:15,858 --> 01:26:20,320
"You know, I'm far away."
- In the sky?

861
01:26:22,447 --> 01:26:26,952
- Exactly, in the sky.
"Will you come back soon?"

862
01:26:35,418 --> 01:26:42,133
- Well, at first I need something here
Finish - Okay then. We are waiting for you.

863
01:26:50,558 --> 01:26:52,184
Volodya,

864
01:26:55,813 --> 01:26:57,605
can you hear me?

865
01:27:01,234 --> 01:27:02,944
I love you.

866
01:27:07,448 --> 01:27:09,950
I love you too.

867
01:27:14,663 --> 01:27:16,540
Come back.

868
01:28:57,761 --> 01:29:01,431
There is nothing to breathe here. What for?

869
01:29:06,602 --> 01:29:09,771
Well, it's time to undock.

870
01:29:11,273 --> 01:29:13,066
You're flying home.

871
01:29:13,942 --> 01:29:17,029
Every 8 hours you will stab yourself
omnopon from the first aid kit.

872
01:29:17,195 --> 01:29:19,739
Then you have enough oxygen to the Earth.

873
01:29:20,574 --> 01:29:23,076
You know how to undo manually.

874
01:29:24,953 --> 01:29:29,415
You'll land somewhere in the Indian
the ocean. You've wanted to go there for a long time.

875
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:33,710
Why can not we both be together?

876
01:29:35,212 --> 01:29:37,297
For two oxygen is not enough ...

877
01:29:40,091 --> 01:29:42,135
I'm not going anywhere alone.

878
01:29:45,055 --> 01:29:47,515
Do not say nonsense, your wife gives birth.

879
01:29:48,391 --> 01:29:52,562
"I'm not going anywhere alone."
"And I order you."

880
01:29:53,062 --> 01:29:54,605
We're wasting time.

881
01:29:54,856 --> 01:30:00,402
Listen, we must go out into space and
gouging this sensor housing to the limit,

882
01:30:00,694 --> 01:30:04,197
then the batteries will start working.
And we will get electricity.

883
01:30:04,572 --> 01:30:08,744
Regeneration will give oxygen, and we
we can receive a rescue ship.

884
01:30:09,119 --> 01:30:11,163
It is necessary only to gouge this case.

885
01:30:11,413 --> 01:30:15,501
- Yes, than we gouged it, a sledgehammer or what?
- We did not even try to do it!

886
01:30:15,876 --> 01:30:21,173
Listen, Vitya, you understand that if we go out and
do not break this body, no one will return home!

887
01:30:21,381 --> 01:30:23,758
No one will have enough oxygen,
Do you understand this?

888
01:30:24,008 --> 01:30:26,719
- I understand it.
"Well, let's go home."

889
01:30:27,219 --> 01:30:29,221
If I return alone,

890
01:30:30,472 --> 01:30:34,184
as I am to my child
in the eye I will look?

891
01:30:36,562 --> 01:30:39,815
And how am I to your child
I'll look into my eyes?

892
01:31:32,948 --> 01:31:36,202
Do not hold tight. Hands will be ill.

893
01:31:38,996 --> 01:31:42,039
How do you know that I hold tight?

894
01:31:42,957 --> 01:31:46,252
I, when I first left,
also held fast.

895
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:48,462
Hands then ached.

896
01:32:38,051 --> 01:32:41,888
- Well, how about you?
- Well. As on the ground.

897
01:32:46,893 --> 01:32:52,398
Vitya, it turns me.
Secure from the other side.

898
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:02,532
- Like this?
- Yes, it is.

899
01:33:33,352 --> 01:33:36,272
Vitya, look, go no?

900
01:33:44,697 --> 01:33:46,365
Just so far.

901
01:34:55,805 --> 01:35:00,644
We enter the shadow of the Earth. Now
it will become very cold.

902
01:35:08,901 --> 01:35:10,778
That's all, Vitya.

903
01:35:13,572 --> 01:35:15,032
All.

904
01:35:23,206 --> 01:35:27,210
Well, back to the ship
or will we stay here?

905
01:36:05,662 --> 01:36:11,669
Never thought why
do some of the cosmonauts have births?

906
01:36:14,421 --> 01:36:18,175
Well, like this. Thought.

907
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:24,473
All the tough guys, and some
the girls go out.

908
01:36:25,890 --> 01:36:27,350
Well yes.

909
01:36:28,851 --> 01:36:32,938
Maybe because the girls are cool?

910
01:36:35,274 --> 01:36:37,526
There is no doubt about this.

911
01:36:40,863 --> 01:36:46,577
And I do not even know how it is there
now. Can give birth already.

912
01:36:47,411 --> 01:36:50,122
Look at least once.

913
01:36:52,122 --> 01:36:55,709
No, Vitya. Once in a while it's not enough.

914
01:36:56,251 --> 01:36:59,922
Yes, once - a little.

915
01:37:23,193 --> 01:37:25,822
We will shoot down the station.

916
01:37:29,534 --> 01:37:31,536
We did everything we could.

917
01:37:34,872 --> 01:37:36,415
And you too.

918
01:38:06,402 --> 01:38:08,903
As a child my father drove the forest.

919
01:38:13,574 --> 01:38:15,993
In the cold, the chains were torn.

920
01:38:21,916 --> 01:38:27,337
Viscosity decreases in the cold,
brittleness increases.

921
01:38:29,089 --> 01:38:36,720
If you wait until the metal cools down
degrees to a hundred, it can crack.

922
01:38:38,014 --> 01:38:40,016
Let's try.

923
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:44,729
Before sunrise can be done.

924
01:38:47,357 --> 01:38:48,691
Come on.

925
01:39:42,283 --> 01:39:46,203
Come on. Come on!

926
01:40:46,509 --> 01:40:49,929
- Volodya, this is all
- Not all!

927
01:40:50,597 --> 01:40:51,681
Yet!

928
01:42:18,055 --> 01:42:23,310
Guys, your mother. Do you hear me?
We see you!

929
01:42:24,687 --> 01:42:26,396
What are you doing there?

930
01:42:28,397 --> 01:42:31,025
Dawn, I'm Pamir-1, I hear you.

931
01:42:31,275 --> 01:42:37,865
We repair the station. Although no.
It seems that we fixed it.

932
01:43:35,753 --> 01:43:39,173
Pamirs, reception. Why are you silent?

933
01:43:39,799 --> 01:43:41,300
How was Lily?

934
01:43:41,842 --> 01:43:44,886
Has given birth. Girl.

935
01:43:46,429 --> 01:43:48,181
Congratulations,

936
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:52,018
Now you are a real astronaut.

937
01:47:19,797 --> 01:47:22,216
This is the perfect order, yes, Volodya?

938
01:47:24,093 --> 01:47:26,595
- How can we see now?
- Perfectly.

939
01:47:26,804 --> 01:47:30,182
Come on, breathe. This is not visible, excellent.

940
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:35,645
Now, can you take off the caps?
And one minute without hats to stand?

941
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:41,150
Because we owe you all the same
show without hats.

942
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:46,447
It's all right. if you have
say something, then we are ready.

943
01:47:47,305 --> 01:48:47,870
