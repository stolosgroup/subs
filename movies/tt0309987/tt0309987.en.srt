1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,300
The first time I saw a movie
at the Cinematheque Francaise...

3
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,470
I thought, "Only the French-

4
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,170
Only the French would house
a cinema inside a palace."

5
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,160
The movie was
Sam Fuller's Shock Corridor.

6
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,060
Its images were so powerful,
it was like being hypnotized.

7
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,360
I was 20 years old.
It was the late '60s...

8
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,530
and I'd come to Paris
for a year to study French.

9
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,660
But it was here
that I got my real education.

10
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,600
I became a member of what in those days
was kind of a free masonry..

11
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,800
A free masonry of cinephiles...

12
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,850
what we'd call "film buffs."

13
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,480
I was one of the insatiables...

14
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,620
the ones you'd always find
sitting closest to the screen.

15
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,390
Why do we sit so close?

16
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,030
Maybe it was because we wanted
to receive the images first...

17
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,800
when they were still new,
still fresh...

18
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,570
before they cleared the hurdles
of the rows behind us...

19
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,340
before they'd been relayed back
from row to row, spectator to spectator...

20
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,900
until worn-out, secondhand,
the size of a postage stamp...

21
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,010
it returned to the
projectionist's cabin.

22
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,820
Doctor, I'm not nuts!
I'm here from the paper! I'm a plant!

23
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,820
Maybe, too, the screen
really was a screen.

24
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,260
It screened us...
from the world.

25
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,370
But there was one evening
in the spring of 1968...

26
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,710
when the world finally
burst through the screen.

27
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,370
The pawn of an obscure coalition...

28
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,000
of dubious interests...

29
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,240
the Minister Malraux
has driven...

30
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,120
Henri Langlois out
of the French Cinematheque.

31
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,190
...if offered us all
a free and fair conception...

32
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,350
of French film culture.

33
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,090
Now, for bureaucratic reasons,
culture's arch-enemies...

34
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,690
have seized this bastion
of liberty.

35
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,700
Resist them!

36
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,700
- Liberty isn't given!
- It's taken!

37
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,430
All those who love film...

38
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,030
- In France...
- And abroad.

39
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,230
...are with you.

40
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,610
And with Henry Langlois!

41
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,580
It was Henri Langlois,
who created the Cinematheque...

42
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,660
and it was because
he liked to show movies...

43
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,730
instead of letting them rot
in some underground vault...

44
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,760
to show any movies-
good, bad, old, new...

45
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,630
silents, Westerns, thrillers-

46
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,730
that all the New Wave filmmakers
came here to learn their craft..

47
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,960
This was where
modern cinema was born.

48
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,100
What lies behind it?

49
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,400
The police!

50
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,480
Langlois had been sacked
by the government...

51
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,020
and it seemed like every film buff
in Paris had turned out in protest.

52
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,750
It was our very own
cultural revolution.

53
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,640
Excuse me.

54
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,650
Can you remove this?

55
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,610
It's stuck to my lips.

56
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,650
Can you remove my cigarette?
It's stuck.

57
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,880
Yes, yes...

58
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,480
of course.

59
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,990
Sorry.

60
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,360
- What are you, English?
- No. I'm American.

61
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,330
You can put it out now.

62
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,070
- What's your name?
- Matthew.

63
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,470
You're here a lot, aren't you?
But you never talk to anyone.

64
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,550
We've been wondering
why you're always alone.

65
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,670
I don't really know anybody.

66
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,840
How come you're
chained to the gates?

67
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,280
I'm not chained
to the gates.

68
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,220
- You're awfully clean.
- What?

69
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,820
For someone who likes
the cinema so much.

70
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,900
- Do you know Jacques?
- Jacques?

71
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,490
"If shit could shit,
it would smell just like Jacques."

72
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,660
My brother's
gone to talk to him.

73
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,900
When he gets back, you'll be able
to smell Jacques on him.

74
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,100
It's like
being around pigs.

75
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,540
- You speak English really well.
- What?

76
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,550
- You speak English really well.
- My mother's English.

77
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,740
- Here's Theo. When I introduce you, just give him a sniff.
- Come on.

78
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,370
Truffaut, Godard, Charbol, Rivette...

79
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,920
and Renoir,Jean Rouch,
Rohmerare here.

80
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,720
Signoret, Jean Marais
and God knows who else.

81
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,090
Marcel Carne too.

82
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,890
Why is Carne here?

83
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,230
What should we do?
Stay or leave?

84
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,700
I don't know.

85
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,530
Theo, this is Matthew.

86
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,130
- You were right. He's American.
- Hi.

87
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,940
I've seen you around. You've been coming
to all the Nicholas Rays.

88
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,540
Yeah. I really like his movies.

89
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,210
- What? They Live By Night?
- Mm-mm. More like...

90
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,720
Johnny Guitar
and Rebel Without a Cause.

91
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,220
- You know what Godard wrote about him?
- No. What?

92
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,380
"Nicholas Ray is cinema."

93
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,460
- What's up with you?
- Me?

94
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,760
Come on, stick with me!

95
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,930
Fascists!

96
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,000
- Bastards!
- Assholes!

97
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,830
And that was how I first met
Theo and Isabelle.

98
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,380
I could hear my heart pounding.

99
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,780
I don't know if it was
because I'd just been chased by the police...

100
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,120
or because I was already
in love with my new friends.

101
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,320
As we walked and talked
and talked and talked...

102
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,050
about politics, about movies...

103
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,030
and why the French could never come
close to producing a good rock band-

104
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,160
- I'm starving.
- I forgot the sandwiches.

105
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,290
I didn't want that night
ever to end.

106
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,200
- Merci.
- Didn't you bring anything?

107
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,640
No. I'm okay.
Please eat.

108
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,470
Don't mind me.

109
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,880
- No. I'm really not hungry.
- I've broken it now. Take it.

110
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,180
- You're very kind, but I don't- - For
goodness sake, take it when you're offered it.

111
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,250
Thank you.

112
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,350
- Theo, don't you have something for Matthew?
- This is fine.

113
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,920
- I gave him a third of mine.
- Okay.

114
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,090
- Really, I didn't come here to eat your sandwiches.
- He doesn't want it.

115
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,690
Yes, he does! He's just too polite
to say he does.

116
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,200
- Aren't you, Matthew?
- You're very kind.

117
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,110
- So where are you from exactly?
- San Diego.

118
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:23,910
What about you two?
Were you both born in Paris?

119
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,580
I entered this world on
the Champs Elysees, 1959.

120
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,620
The pavement of the Champs-Elysees.

121
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,850
And you know what
my very first words were?

122
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,920
No. What?

123
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,020
"New York Herald Tribune!"

124
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,890
New York Herald Tribune!

125
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,800
- New York Herald Tribune!
- New York Herald Tribune!

126
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,630
Will you come to Rome with me?

127
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,110
Here! Right here! Here!

128
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,800
No, there!

129
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,280
- Good night, Matthew!
- Night.

130
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,160
"Dear Mom...

131
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,130
"I've got some real news this time.

132
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,760
I just met
my first French friends."

133
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,070
- Hello.
- Matthew?

134
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,410
Who is this?

135
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,680
- Don't be suspicious. It's me.
- Theo?

136
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,690
- Don't tell me I woke you up.
- No, I-

137
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,020
- I've been up for ages.
- You don't sound as if you've been up for ages.

138
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,720
I always sound like this
in the morning.

139
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,590
Sorry. I had to call you early
because I go to class at 9:00.

140
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:10,830
- Right.
- Listen, you want to have dinner tomorrow night?

141
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:16,270
Um, you mean like a real dinner
in a nice restaurant?

142
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,040
No, not in a restaurant.
Here at home.

143
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,340
Yeah, I'd-
Sure, that'd be great.

144
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,910
Yes? Okay, why don't you-

145
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,010
Theo, please get off the phone.
It's 9:00.

146
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,080
Yes, yes. Why don't you meet us
for a drink first at Le Raspail, 6:00?

147
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,180
You know where it is?

148
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,090
- Boulevard Saint-Germain?
- Be there are 6:00.

149
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,930
Hey!

150
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,760
- Third floor!

151
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,200
You know, there's room
in here for all of us.

152
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,800
Theo and I are contagious!
- What?

153
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,670
- We're very contagious!
- Contagious?

154
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,640
You mustn't catch us.

155
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,630
- It's beautiful.
- You think so?

156
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,200
Good luck.

157
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,570
Evening, Maman.

158
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,510
What are you doing here?

159
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,780
- We're here for dinner.
- What?

160
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,680
With Matthew.

161
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,350
- Didn't Isabelle say?
- Which Matthew?

162
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,510
This Matthew.

163
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,920
He's our new friend.
Matthew, this is my mother.

164
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,990
- Hi.
- Very pleased to meet you, Matthew.

165
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,620
- Likewise.
- Oh, you're American, are you?

166
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,990
- Yeah. I'm from California.
- Oh.

167
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,660
Matthew lives in that nasty student
Hotel Malebranche...

168
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,530
- so we invited him to dinner.
- Oh.

169
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,200
What's wrong?

170
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,610
What can I say, Isabelle?
I'm cooking for two...

171
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,270
and now there are
five of us.

172
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,470
Didn't Theo
tell you?

173
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,310
No, he didn't.
And neither did you.

174
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,580
Have you got mashed potatoes
for brains or what?

175
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,480
You were supposed
to tell her!

176
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,210
You're crazy!

177
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,880
Bitch, cow, slut-

178
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,960
Oh, for God's sake!
Put a sock in it, you two!

179
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,230
I must apologize for
my children's behavior, Matthew.

180
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,560
No. I'm the one
who should be apologizing.

181
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,160
Please don't put yourself out
on account of me.

182
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,800
That's very sweet of you,
seeing as you're completely blameless.

183
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,210
Let me look at you.

184
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,110
Okay. I want you to make
a good impression on Papa.

185
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,490
Papa, it's me.

186
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,080
We're eating in.

187
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,560
And the cinematheque?

188
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,890
Closed until further
notice.

189
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,490
Papa, can't you see we have a guest?

190
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,830
- This is Matthew.
- Oh.

191
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,240
- Sir.
- Matthew.

192
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,280
Matthew's dining
with us tonight.

193
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,750
My young Matthew,
inspiration is like a baby.

194
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,840
It does not choose a nice,
seemly hour to enter the world.

195
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,410
It has no consideration
for the poor poets. I know.

196
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,090
But when it does come...

197
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:43,250
when it deigns to come,
then you know it's-

198
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:53,300
Young man, I was speaking to you.
I imagine you were listening.

199
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,770
I was.
I'm- I'm sorry.

200
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,940
What?

201
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,980
Nothing.
I was just, um-

202
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,810
You seemed to be mesmerized
by this tin lighter.

203
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,050
I'd like to know why.

204
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,910
- Well?
- George, please.

205
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,480
- Matthew's our guest.
- No, no. I'm genuinely curious.

206
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,390
I'd like to know why.

207
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:26,060
I was just- I was fidgeting
with Isabelle's lighter...

208
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,160
and... I wasn't
really realizing it...

209
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,260
then I noticed,
and I thought it was rude...

210
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,340
so I put it down
on the table.

211
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,070
But I put it diagonally across
one of these squares.

212
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,670
Do you see?

213
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,800
Look.

214
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,580
That's when I noticed
that the lighter's length...

215
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,650
is exactly the same length
as the diagonal itself.

216
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,520
So I put it lengthwise,
along the outside edge.

217
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,430
- Look. It fits there too.
- Yeah.

218
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,160
But it fits there.

219
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:02,270
And it fits like this
and like this...

220
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,630
and this way too.

221
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,970
And I bet you if
I just split it in half...

222
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,940
you know, it's
got to fit somewhere.

223
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,450
I mean, it really
fits anywhere. Look.

224
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,610
See?

225
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,210
I was noticing that the more
you look at everything-

226
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,120
this table, the objects on it,
the refrigerator, this room...

227
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,320
- your nose, the world-

228
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:33,520
suddenly...

229
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,900
you realize that there's some
sort of cosmic harmony...

230
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,730
of shapes and sizes.

231
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,800
I was just wondering why.
I don't know why that is.

232
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,470
I know that it is.

233
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,650
You have an interesting
friend here.

234
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,050
More interesting, I suspect,
than you know.

235
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:10,190
I mean, when we look around us,
what is it we see?

236
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:15,070
Complete chaos.

237
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,400
Yet viewed from above...

238
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,740
viewed, as it were,
by God...

239
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,640
everything suddenly
fits together.

240
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,910
My children believe that
their demonstrations and sit-ins...

241
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,950
and happenings...

242
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,850
what, they believe that these possess
the capacity...

243
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,830
not only to provoke society,
but also to transform it.

244
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:51,260
What is it you're saying? If Langlois
is dismissed, we shouldn't do anything?

245
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:57,140
If immigrants are deported, if students
are beaten up, we shouldn't do anything?

246
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,470
What I'm saying is that
a little lucidity would not go amiss.

247
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,910
So, uh,
everyone's wrong but you?

248
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,640
In France, in Italy,
Germany, America?

249
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,120
Listen to me, Theo.
Before you can change the world...

250
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,280
you must realize
you yourself are part of it.

251
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:17,090
You cannot stand outside
looking in.

252
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,160
You're the one
who stands outside.

253
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,430
You're the one who refused to sign
a petition against the Vietnam War.

254
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,730
Poets don't sign petitions.
They sign poems.

255
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,930
A petition is a poem.

256
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,000
Yes! And a poem is a petition.
Thank you, but I'm not gaga yet.

257
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,100
I don't need you to remind me
of my own work!

258
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,480
- Hmm?
- That's right.

259
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,570
A petition is a poem,
a poem is a petition.

260
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,710
- Yes.
- Those are the most famous lines you ever wrote.

261
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,180
And now look at you.

262
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,290
I hope I'll never be like him.

263
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,130
Theo.

264
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,130
We should say goodnight, darling.

265
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,760
We got a long day
ahead of us tomorrow.

266
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,090
George.

267
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,470
Yes, sorry. You were saying?

268
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,100
We should go to bed.

269
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,470
You had something
to tell the children, didn't you?

270
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,940
Yes, of course.

271
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,520
I'm sorry.

272
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,810
The cheques
are on the mantelpiece.

273
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,510
Don't cash them
until you need them, all right?

274
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,590
Good night, everybody.

275
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,660
Good night, Papa. Have a safe journey.

276
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,790
Good night, dear.
Theo.

277
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,870
A very good night to you, Matthew.

278
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,870
It was a pleasure meeting you, sir.
A pleasure.

279
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,330
- Very nice meeting you, Matthew.
- You too.

280
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,410
- Thank you so much for dinner.
- It's my pleasure.

281
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,500
Why don't you invite Matthew
to spend the night?

282
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,940
I'm not sure I like the sound
of Hotel Malebranche.

283
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,380
Good night.

284
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:25,370
Why haven't you dazzled us with these
philosophical speculations of yours?

285
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,740
- I didn't know I was being philosophical.
- Papa was awfully impressed.

286
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:34,010
- Papa's full of shit.
- I think you're lucky.

287
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,920
I- I wish my parents
were that nice.

288
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,120
Other people's parents
are always nicer than our own.

289
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,720
And yet for some reason,
our own grandparents...

290
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,520
are always nicer
than other people's.

291
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,060
You know, that's true.
That's- That's absolutely true.

292
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:55,370
I never thought about it before,
but it's- it's true.

293
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,170
Matthew, you sweet-

294
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,900
This...

295
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:04,000
is double the length of-

296
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,810
Well, I'm for bed.

297
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,260
Are you staying?

298
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:28,500
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

299
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,470
Good night, Matthew.

300
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,850
Everybody's got a father.

301
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,940
Yes.

302
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,920
But the fact that
God doesn't exist...

303
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,350
doesn't mean
he can take his place.

304
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,000
Okay?

305
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,630
- That's fine.

306
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,800
- Good night.
- Good night.

307
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,200
- See you in the morning.
- See you.

308
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,300
- Thank-

309
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,380
Thank you.

310
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,420
No!

311
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,710
Good morning.

312
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,720
What was that all about?

313
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,060
I was removing the sleep
from your eyes.

314
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,190
Theo lets me do his
every morning.

315
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,430
That's the strangest thing
to want to do.

316
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,560
Didn't you enjoy it?

317
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,970
- Was I supposed to?
- Naturally.

318
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,080
Up, up, up, up, up!
What are you waiting for?

319
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,640
Isabelle,
I'm not dressed.

320
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:40,470
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

321
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:45,520
I've been memorizing this room.

322
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,140
In the future, in my memory...

323
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:52,250
I shall live a great deal in this room.

324
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,320
Queen Christina...

325
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,420
where Greta Garbo
bids farewell to the room...

326
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,500
where she spent the night
with John Gilbert.

327
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,030
Bravo!

328
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,190
Alors.
We have a private wing to ourselves.

329
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,290
The bathroom's
at the end of the corridor.

330
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,530
If you aren't there in one minute,
we're coming back to get you!

331
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,570
Come in.

332
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,030
Good morning.

333
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,630
Are you going to church?

334
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:56,480
Oh, sorry. You want to use
my toothbrush?

335
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,550
- Uh, no.
- Sure?

336
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,350
I'll use my finger.

337
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,930
- Sleep well?
- Yeah.

338
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,430
- I mean, fine.
- Good.

339
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,200
- You know, Matthew?
- Hmm.

340
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:29,010
You really do have the most
beautiful pair of lips.

341
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:33,580
Can I touch them?

342
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,240
- You- You wanna touch my lips?
- Uh-huh.

343
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,120
Okay.

344
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:49,890
So red... and ripe
and luscious.

345
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,490
So sullen, brutal.

346
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,940
Let's see what you
look like with lipstick.

347
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,470
- I really should be going.
- You'd make such a pretty girl.

348
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:03,540
Ignore her, Matthew.
She sucks in all the air around her.

349
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,270
No, I- I really have to, um,
be getting back to my hotel.

350
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,910
No. Why? You have been
invited to stay.

351
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,950
- Really?
- Sure.

352
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,150
You know our parents
have left..

353
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,620
They're going to be
in Trouves for a month.

354
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,390
We thought you might like
to move your things here.

355
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,790
- R-Really?
- Sure.

356
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,560
But you just met me two days ago.
You barely even know me.

357
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:30,460
This way we get to know you. You
don't have to stay in a hotel, do you?

358
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,970
- No.
- Then we'll go and pick up what you need...

359
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,060
with my Mobilette, okay?

360
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,970
- Come on.
- But... what about you?

361
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,100
It was my idea.

362
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,150
Whoa! You're scaring me right now!

363
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,710
Jesus.

364
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,620
I'm going to check out
the Cinematheque, just in case.

365
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,750
- Okay.
- Don't take too long.

366
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,990
Don't worry, I won't.
I don't have much stuff.

367
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,160
With us, you're not
going to need much.

368
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,240
Okay.

369
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:16,910
Oh,just don't forget
your toothbrush!

370
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,050
Okay.

371
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,350
"Dear Mom, I guess you're surprised
to be hearing from me...

372
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,450
"so soon after my last letter.

373
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,860
"But I've just moved out of my hotel
and into an apartment...

374
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,450
"belonging to a famous
French author...

375
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,860
"whose children are the same age as me
and have the same interests.

376
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:46,530
"I know how pleased you'll be to hear I'm
getting in with the right kind of people.

377
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,300
Sayhello to Father.
I hope he's not still mad at me."

378
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,370
Listen to this, Matthew.

379
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,310
"The difference between
Keaton and Chaplin...

380
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,350
"is the difference
between prose and poetry...

381
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,850
"between the aristocrat
and the tramp...

382
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:02,380
"between eccentricity
and mysticism...

383
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:06,080
between man as a machine
and man as animal."

384
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,820
Not bad, huh?

385
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:11,990
That's good. Except for me,
there's no comparison.

386
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:16,000
Why? 'Cause Chaplin's
incomparable?

387
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:21,270
No. Because Keaton
is incomparable.

388
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:25,570
Keaton? You think Keaton's
greater than Chaplin?

389
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,670
- Absolutely I do.
- Oh, you're not serious.

390
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,010
- Of course I am.
- You're crazy.

391
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,880
Come on. In the first place, you can't
deny that Keaton's funnier than Chaplin.

392
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:39,180
- Yes, I can.
- You don't think that Keaton is funnier than Chaplin?

393
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:41,850
- I don't think anyone's funnier than Chaplin.
- Keaton is!

394
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,930
Even when he's not doing anything,
he's funny. And he looks like Godard.

395
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:48,960
Keaton is a real filmmaker. Chaplin, all
he cares about is his own performance...

396
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,690
- his own ego.
- That's bullshit.

397
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,530
- It's not bullshit.
- Yes, it is.

398
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,360
You Americans understand fuck-all
about your own culture.

399
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:02,240
- No wonder you never got the point of Jerry Lewis.
- Don't even get me started!

400
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:06,440
Listen, when Chaplin wanted
to have a beautiful shot, he knew how.

401
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:09,740
Better than Keaton,
better than anybody.

402
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,750
You remember the last shot
of City Lights?

403
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:16,120
He looks at the flower girl,
she looks at him...

404
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,410
and don't forget,
she'd been blind...

405
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,490
so she was seeing him
for the very first time.

406
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:25,290
It's as if, through her eyes,
we also see him for the very first time.

407
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,990
Charlie Chaplin, Charlot,
the most famous man in the world...

408
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,900
and it's as if we've never
really seen him before.

409
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,970
Isa, if you play that fucking record again,
I'll break it in two, okay?

410
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,140
But you like
Janis Joplin.

411
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,610
Stop it!

412
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,620
- I said stop it, Isabelle!

413
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,650
Stop!

414
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,850
- Tell me, what film?
- Wha-What?

415
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,950
Name a film-
Let go!

416
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,530
Name a film where someone
tap dancing drives someone else crazy!

417
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:05,360
- Oh, I know this!
- Come on! Quick! Quick!

418
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:10,700
Top Hat! Top Hat! Fred Astaire's
dancing over Ginger Rogers's room.

419
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:16,440
And she's mad
because he wakes her up.

420
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,340
I'm right.

421
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,940
He's good.

422
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,650
You know what I'm thinking?

423
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,150
What?

424
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,810
"Bande א part."

425
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,360
You're right.

426
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,160
Why are you two
looking at me like that?

427
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:42,790
Well, you see,
my little Matthew...

428
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,130
there's something Theo and I have
been meaning to do for a long time...

429
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,070
but we've been waiting
for the right person to do it with.

430
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,370
- And I think you're finally it!
- To do what?

431
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,340
Try to be the record
of Bande a part.

432
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,740
- What record?
- You've seen Bande a part, haven't you?

433
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,750
- Yeah.
- Remember the scene where the three race through the Louvre?

434
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,980
- Uh, vaguely. Remind me.
- They try to beat the world record...

435
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:06,050
- of 9 minutes and 45 seconds.
- Oh, yeah! Of course.

436
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,710
We're going to beat
their record.

437
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,150
Uh, oh.

438
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:14,200
- What?
- What's the matter?

439
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,320
- Nothing, really, I'm-
- Not afraid, are you?

440
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:21,030
- No. I'm not afraid.
- What, then?

441
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:24,870
It's easy for you two. I'm an American,
what you French call an alien.

442
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,740
- So?
- So if I get caught, I get deported.

443
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,610
Well, don't worry, little man,
we're not going to get caught.

444
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,200
- Yeah, you don't know that.
- They weren't caught in Bande a part.

445
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:37,720
- And if we beat their record-
- It's a movie!

446
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:41,450
- Go get Papa's stopwatch.
- It's a great idea, but-

447
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,580
Matthew, this is a test.

448
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:48,220
Are you going to pass it
or fail it?

449
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:52,860
Be careful. A lot depends
on how you answer.

450
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,130
He! Non! Arretez!

451
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,460
Nine minutes
and 28 seconds.

452
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,050
We beat the record
by 17 seconds!

453
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,270
Matthew!
My little Matthew!

454
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,400
You were wonderful!

455
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,240
- We accept him. One of us!
- One of us!

456
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,410
We accept him, one of us!

457
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,810
We accept him, one of us!

458
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,780
We accept her,
we accept her.

459
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:55,910
Gooble, gobble.
Gooble, gobble.

460
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,920
- We accept him, one of us!
- One of us!

461
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,300
Hey!

462
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,210
Theo. Isabelle.

463
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,340
Theo.

464
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,420
Hey!

465
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:49,330
- We accept you, one of us!
One of us! One of us!

466
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,410
One of us! One of us!

467
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,510
That's Mama.

468
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,550
I'm too wet to answer.

469
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,810
Isa's smart, but she doesn't
know how to deal with parents.

470
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,050
- What do you mean?
- I mean, it's not enough to ignore them.

471
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,100
They should all be arrested...

472
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,500
put on trial,
confess their crimes...

473
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,160
sent to the country
for self-criticism...

474
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:29,270
and reeducation!

475
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:33,810
- They're already in the country.
- They are at the seaside.

476
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,610
That's different.

477
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,140
Allo. Allo?

478
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,910
Too bad.

479
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,580
My parents never go anywhere.

480
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:48,850
At least you have
the house to yourselves.

481
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,960
Where are you going?

482
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:56,260
Uh, I gotta get
out of these clothes.

483
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,460
It'll be cold in your room.
Come into mine.

484
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:04,000
- Okay.

485
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,730
You can wear this.

486
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,130
Thanks.

487
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:55,520
I'm going to get a Coca.
You want one?

488
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,590
Okay.

489
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,290
- Matthew!
- Yeah!

490
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,430
- Just open the door. My hands are full.
- Just a second.

491
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,710
- Why didn't you open the door?
- I was-

492
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:59,240
I was dressing.

493
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,460
What film?

494
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,660
In what film does a chorus line
dance like this...

495
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:32,370
with a singer
in a fur coat?

496
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,240
- I've seen this film?
- We saw it together.

497
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:38,340
- We did? Give me a clue.
- Certainly not.

498
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:41,150
- Come on. Be a sport. Director's name.
- No.

499
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:44,880
Number of words in the title.

500
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,960
- I said no. Non!
- Isabelle!

501
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:52,020
- The first letter of the first word.
- God! You're pathetic.

502
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,190
Isn't he pathetic, Matthew?
Don't you think he's pathetic?

503
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,600
- Matthew, I bet you know.
- Don't you dare help him.

504
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,760
Did the Sphinx
give Oedipus a clue?

505
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:06,070
- Fuck you.

506
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:08,140
Give up?

507
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:11,480
Yeah.

508
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:25,220
- Blonde Venus. Marlene Dietrich. 1932.
- Shit.

509
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,790
I knew that.

510
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:32,330
- Forfeit.
- If you insist.

511
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:34,420
I dare you to do now...

512
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:36,500
in front of us...

513
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,230
what I've watched you do...
in front of her.

514
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,810
Who?

515
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:43,970
I don't know
what you're talking about.

516
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,140
Oh, yes, you do, my pet.

517
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,110
- Forfeit.

518
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:52,080
What a bitch you are.

519
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,340
A bitch and a sadist.

520
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:57,550
Are you going to pay
the forfeit or not?

521
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:06,060
Very well.

522
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,600
Mm-mm-mm. I want you to do it
the way you did it...

523
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,700
when you thought
no one was watching.

524
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:10,870
Let's have a drink.
I'll meet you downstairs.

525
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,670
- Matthew.
- Yes?

526
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,290
Yes.

527
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,770
Why don't you admit
you were thrilled?

528
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,970
Come on.
You can tell me.

529
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,570
What?

530
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,710
Weren't you just
a tiny bit excited?

531
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:59,620
- What is it exactly you're trying to get me to say?
- I asked you a question.

532
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,710
Well, I suppose you know
who you sound like.

533
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,790
- Who?
- Isabelle.

534
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:05,920
Why not?
She's my twin sister.

535
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:08,120
- You two are twins?
- Yes.

536
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:10,290
She'd be me
if she were a man.

537
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,890
- That's crap. You're not identical.
- Yes, we are.

538
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,200
We're Siamese twins,
joined here.

539
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,000
You're a strange one, Theo.

540
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:26,980
Half an hour ago, I saw you look at her
as though you wanted to strangle her.

541
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,570
I did.

542
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,810
I don't understand you.

543
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,940
- Don't you have any brothers or sisters?
- I have two older sisters.

544
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:37,650
Didn't you ever
want to strangle them?

545
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,990
Of course I did! But I never masturbated
in front of them, and I never-

546
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,550
They never forced me to do
anything I never wanted to do.

547
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:49,100
You think Isabelle
forced me, do you?

548
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:05,310
Deep down I knew things
couldn't go on as before.

549
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,010
Now the stakes had been raised.

550
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:13,220
But for a while, at least, there did seem to
be a kind of truce between Theo and Isabelle.

551
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,050
And then one evening-

552
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,990
- Theo!

553
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:35,140
- What film?
- "What film?"

554
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:40,310
Name a film where a cross marks the
spot of a murder, or pay the forfeit.

555
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:46,150
- You too, Matthew.
- Me?

556
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:50,160
What- What have I done?

557
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,560
Name a film
or pay the forfeit.

558
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:57,220
- Uh, um-
- Time's up.

559
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:01,670
- Time's up? You didn't even give me a chance.
- The film?

560
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:06,670
Scarface.
Howard Hawks, 1932.

561
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:09,610
And the forfeit?

562
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:12,970
Well, now...

563
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:17,950
as you know, Isabelle,
I'm not a sadist.

564
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:22,110
I just want to see everyone happy,
no one left out.

565
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:25,450
So I'd like you...

566
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,120
and Matthew...

567
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:31,700
to make love
in front of me.

568
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,920
But not in here.

569
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:37,120
I don't fancy sleeping in someone
else's revolting sweat.

570
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:40,230
- No offense, Matthew.
- Where?

571
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,630
In the spare room...

572
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,300
in front of
the Delacroix.

573
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:48,610
Maybe one reproduction
will inspire another.

574
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:50,940
- Um, um-
- I won't do it.

575
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,210
- Won't do it?
- You wouldn't.

576
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,310
Matthew
isn't my type.

577
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,630
Okay.

578
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,350
I gotta go to the bathroom.

579
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:16,050
Matthew! Matthew.

580
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,560
Matthew.

581
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,660
Matthew.

582
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,740
Yes?

583
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,930
This is silly.
Come out of there.

584
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:15,580
Okay.

585
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:21,050
- Okay. All right.

586
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:24,050
Look. Wait. Look.
You're hurting me!

587
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,720
I'm not violent. I'm-
I'm against violence.

588
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:32,120
- I'm not gonna resist. Look.
- So shut up. Okay?

589
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:36,100
- Okay.
- Now, Matthew, you aren't being very gallant.

590
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:41,000
Is the prospect of making love to me
so hateful?

591
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,460
I've seen you.
I saw you in bed together.

592
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:50,100
Oh. Our guest
has been spying on us.

593
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:53,940
Hmm. Now, that wasn't
a friendly thing to do, Matthew.

594
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:58,010
Especially when we've
been so hospitable.

595
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,960
Okay, okay. Look-

596
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:04,650
- Shh, shh.
- I'm not resisting! I'm not resisting!

597
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:23,900
Oh, how sweet
of you, Matthew...

598
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,140
to keep my image
next to your heart.

599
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:28,300
- I didn't mean-

600
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:31,410
Good.

601
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:39,920
Oh, Matthew. Oh, come on.
Oh, wake up. Oh.

602
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,790
Come on, wake up.

603
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:44,860
Isabelle?

604
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,360
No. I'm Theo.

605
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:50,330
Where is Isabelle?

606
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:37,080
You have to help me.

607
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:59,460
Sorry.

608
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:52,810
Oh, that was the best one.

609
00:59:54,850 --> 00:59:57,250
What about yesterday?

610
00:59:57,350 --> 01:00:00,910
- Where?
- In Papa's study.

611
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:03,720
You thought
that was better?

612
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:07,050
Mm-hmm. Please, please,
please, please.

613
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,390
- What?
- Stay inside.

614
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:14,160
Matthew.

615
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:17,230
My love.

616
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:19,920
My first love.

617
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:24,720
My great love.
My great lover.

618
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:29,000
My Valentino.

619
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,400
You know, I thought
you had many lovers.

620
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:10,470
When I first saw you
at the Cinematheque-

621
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:14,440
you and Theo-
you looked so cool.

622
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,880
So sophisticated.

623
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,850
- Like a movie star.
- I was.

624
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:27,180
I was acting, Matthew.

625
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:35,730
How did you and-

626
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:38,730
How did you and Theo...

627
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:42,060
come together
the way that you are?

628
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:44,730
Theo and me?

629
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,640
It was love
at first sight.

630
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,250
But he's never
been inside you?

631
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:05,380
He's always inside me.

632
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:12,730
What would you do-

633
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:18,320
What would you do
if your parents found out?

634
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:20,730
It must never happen.

635
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:26,470
Yeah, I know.
But, uh, what if it did?

636
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,270
It must never, never happen.

637
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:34,750
I understand that.
But let's say that it did.

638
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:38,710
What would you-

639
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:41,260
What would you do?

640
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:49,220
I would kill myself.

641
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,450
Where are you going?

642
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:13,980
Kitchen. I have to get
something to eat.

643
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,050
Good luck.

644
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:46,780
Theo?

645
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,680
- Theo?
- Hmm?

646
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:52,120
- Want some honey?
- No, thank you.

647
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:54,190
- Oh, it's good.
- No.

648
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:56,590
- It's really good. Try some.
- No.

649
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:59,660
- Just try a little bit.
- No. Thank you.

650
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:12,230
I want you to know
that I'm grateful.

651
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:16,130
Grateful?

652
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:20,870
Remember what you told me in that cafe
about you and Isabelle?

653
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:23,640
- Hmm.
- You were right.

654
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:27,850
I mean, for me,
you two are-

655
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:31,890
you're like two halves
of the same person.

656
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:35,520
Now you've made me feel
like I'm a part of you.

657
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,560
Both of you.

658
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:45,530
Let's get something
straight, okay?

659
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:51,640
You're a nice boy
and I like you a lot...

660
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:54,400
but no...

661
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:58,140
it wasn't always meant
to be the three of us.

662
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:05,150
I told you something else,
remember?

663
01:05:07,090 --> 01:05:09,990
That Isa and I
are Siamese twins.

664
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:12,150
Yeah.

665
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:14,250
I wasn't joking.

666
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:04,970
What's this?

667
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:09,140
That, my dear brother,
is a cheese fondue...

668
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:12,700
accompanied by a compote
of broccoli and prunes.

669
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:15,150
- And this?
- That's ratatouille.

670
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:18,380
And you expect me
to eat this muck?

671
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:21,320
- You expected me to cook it.
- I prefer to starve.

672
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:24,390
You will. There's
nothing else in the house.

673
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:27,690
Matthew,
can I serve you?

674
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,130
The fondue
or the ratatouille?

675
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:38,140
Which is which?

676
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,270
This is fondue,
and this is ratatouille.

677
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:44,810
No. This is the fondue,
and this is the ratatouille.

678
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:50,140
- The... ratatouille.
- Ratatouille.

679
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,260
Uh, that-that's fine.

680
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,660
Mm-hmm. Okay.

681
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:09,700
Just eat it as if you were
in some exotic country...

682
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:13,070
you've never visited before
and this is the national dish.

683
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:29,540
It looks like
he's vomiting in reverse.

684
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:33,950
- It's horrible, isn't it?

685
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:37,650
I'm sorry, Isabelle.
I know you tried.

686
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:41,060
Thank you, Matthew. I'm glad
somebody appreciates my efforts.

687
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:44,230
- You say there's no food in the house?
- Nothing you'd want to eat.

688
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:46,830
- And we cashed all the cheques?
- Yes.

689
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:50,300
- So what do we do now?
- I'm going to call Papa.

690
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,920
The phone is dead!

691
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:06,630
- What's all this?

692
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:09,110
It's lunch.

693
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:13,620
So, Isabelle,
a filet mignon.

694
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,980
- No.
- No?

695
01:09:16,090 --> 01:09:19,990
Oh, Matthew, would you
like a rump steak?

696
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,980
Stop it. It's disgusting.

697
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:30,150
Oh, look. What about
this banana?

698
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:32,960
One banana
for three of us?

699
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:36,230
- Uh, yes.
- I'm starving.

700
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:38,930
Let me see it.

701
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,970
- Why?
- Just let me see it.

702
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:52,210
- What are you doing?
- Just watch.

703
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,800
Et voila.

704
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:17,600
Oh, Matthew, you never
cease to surprise.

705
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:20,200
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

706
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:57,540
- Hey, Theo.
- Salut.

707
01:10:57,650 --> 01:10:59,710
- Okay?
- Fine.

708
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:03,150
- Where were you the other night?
- I couldn't make it. Sorry.

709
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:05,310
What's up? We hardly
see you now.

710
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:07,750
- We can't count on you.
- Stop pissing me off!

711
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:09,690
You're not
with us anymore.

712
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:11,720
I am,
but it's complicated.

713
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:13,160
Why?

714
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:15,820
Because! Get off my back.
I can't explain now.

715
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:24,530
Loser!

716
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,600
Theo, wait for me.

717
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:38,480
A little souvenir
from Nepal.

718
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:41,140
Thanks, that's sweet.

719
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:46,920
- Call me.
- Okay, with pleasure.

720
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:49,720
See you.

721
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:59,760
We hardly left the apartment anymore.

722
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:03,140
- We didn't know or care if it was day or night.
- Come on. Come on.

723
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,730
- What?
- It felt as if we were drifting out to sea...

724
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,280
leaving the world
far behind us.

725
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:18,950
- Too strong for you?
- That was really good.

726
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:21,490
- Good? Again?
- Yeah.

727
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:24,250
No.

728
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,330
Clapton's God, Matthew.

729
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:29,160
I don't believe in God.
But if I did...

730
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:31,730
he would be a black,
left-handed guitarist.

731
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:34,460
This is not
Chaplin and Keaton.

732
01:12:34,570 --> 01:12:37,130
This is Clapton
and Hendrix.

733
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:40,760
Matthew, Clapton reinvented
the electric guitar.

734
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:43,430
- Matthew, believe me.

735
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:45,740
- Clapton plugs in a guitar-
- Okay, Jimi Hendrix-

736
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,940
He plugs in an electric guitar,
and he plays it like an acoustic guitar.

737
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:53,110
Hendrix plugs in an electric guitar,
he plays with his teeth.

738
01:12:56,620 --> 01:13:01,250
There are soldiers in
the Vietnam War right now.

739
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:04,420
Who are they
listening to? Clapton?

740
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:09,160
No. They're listening to Hendrix,
the guy who tells the truth.

741
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:11,700
It's fucked up! It's all fucked up!

742
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,140
You're talking
about soldiers in Vietnam?

743
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:16,300
- Yes.
- Okay, what are they doing in Vietnam?

744
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:19,530
- They're at war.
- What are they doing? Please tell me.

745
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:22,980
- They're fighting.
- They're killing farmers!

746
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,570
They're dying too.

747
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:27,380
They're killing children,
they're burning fields!

748
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:30,980
They wanna be there. They wanna die,
and they wanna kill people.

749
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:33,780
Shouldn't you be-
Shouldn't you be in Vietnam?

750
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:37,380
- Right now, shouldn't you be in Vietnam?
- I don't believe in violence.

751
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:41,050
- Where are you, Matthew? Shouldn't you be there right now?
- I'm lucky.

752
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:45,190
I'm in a university. I have friends
who aren't in university.

753
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:48,130
And they're expendable.
They're expendable.

754
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,570
I'm am fucking lucky.

755
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:51,070
Youngsters that don't want the war.

756
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:53,570
Do you think you can
say it to the government?

757
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:56,700
"No. I'm against violence.
I don't agree with your war."

758
01:13:56,810 --> 01:13:58,970
- Maybe in France.
- Okay, anybody-

759
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:02,740
In America, you have to go.
If you don't go, you go to jail.

760
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:05,840
Okay, I prefer to go in jail.
I prefer to go in jail.

761
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:09,510
- Instead ofkilling people, Matthew, I prefer to go in jail.
- You don't understand.

762
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:12,850
I read it
in Cahiers du Cinema.

763
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,550
"A filmmaker
is like a Peeping Tom."

764
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:17,920
A voyeur.

765
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:21,830
It's as if the camera is a-

766
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:25,030
the keyhole
to your parents' bedroom.

767
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:31,010
And you spy on them,
and you're disgusted.

768
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:33,670
You feel guilty...

769
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:38,370
but you can't-
you can't look away.

770
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,250
It makes films like crimes...

771
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:44,290
and directors like criminals.

772
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:48,690
- It should be illegal.

773
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:51,420
There goes my chance
to be a filmmaker.

774
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:54,760
- Why?
- My parents always left the bedroom door open.

775
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:00,570
- You'll have to direct theater,
not cinema.

776
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:02,660
Oh, maybe.

777
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:08,540
Uh.

778
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:11,980
- Whoop.

779
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:17,010
Oop.

780
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:21,540
My parents only fucked
once in their life.

781
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:25,060
That's why we're twins. They
didn't want to make it twice.

782
01:16:36,290 --> 01:16:38,990
Don't be alarmed, Matthew.

783
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:41,360
It's good news.

784
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:43,520
It only happens once a month.

785
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:46,430
Oh.

786
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,990
I love you, Isabelle.

787
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,130
I love you too, Matthew.

788
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:56,170
Yeah, but
I really love you.

789
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:59,870
I really, really love you too.
We both do. Don't we, Theo?

790
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:01,970
Oh, yeah.

791
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,710
That's not what I wanted you to say.

792
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:07,480
What do you want us to say?

793
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:09,550
I wanted you to say
you love me.

794
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:11,650
We just did, Matthew.

795
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,720
No, you said
you love me too.

796
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:16,230
I don't want you
to say you love me too.

797
01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:18,390
I want you to say
that you... love me.

798
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:21,360
Oh, we love you,
we love you, we love you.

799
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:26,340
That's not right, either.
You have to say it first.

800
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:28,700
My God, Matthew.
You already said it first.

801
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:32,540
Why is that? Why am I always
the first to say it?

802
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:36,370
Oh, poor Matthew. Oh!

803
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:40,540
We do love you very much.

804
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:44,610
I don't want to be loved very much.
I want to be loved.

805
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:48,950
You know what
someone once said?

806
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:53,150
"There's no such thing as love.
There are only proofs of love."

807
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:58,030
Are you ready to give us
proof of your love?

808
01:17:59,730 --> 01:18:01,720
You want proof of my love?

809
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:03,800
Mm-hmm.

810
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:06,600
Okay.

811
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:10,700
Get out of the bath.

812
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:24,950
Shaving cream.

813
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:28,050
- Razor.
- Thanks.

814
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:30,820
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

815
01:18:30,930 --> 01:18:33,450
- You're not serious.
- Yes, I am.

816
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:35,590
It's nothing
you need to worry about.

817
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:39,000
- It's an operation I've performed before.
- Relax. It grows back.

818
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:41,940
- You're both fucking crazy!
- What's the matter?

819
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:44,770
This is what you call proof of love?
Turning me into a freak?

820
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,280
- One of us, one of us, one of us, one of us.
- It's just a game.

821
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:50,440
It's just a game!

822
01:18:50,550 --> 01:18:53,680
A game, Isabelle?
A game? Think about it.

823
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:57,020
Think about it. Is this something
you do to each other?

824
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:00,650
You want to shave my pubic hair?
You want me to be a little boy for you?

825
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:04,250
A little prepubescent Theo at six,
who you can play games with?

826
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:06,450
- You can touch peepee.
- Matthew, just-

827
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,590
I'll show you mine. You show me yours.
Come on! Come on!

828
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:11,960
Just calm down.
We hear you.

829
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:14,660
Theo, think about it.
Think.

830
01:19:14,770 --> 01:19:17,860
You sleep in the same bed
together, every night.

831
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:20,960
You bathe together. You pee
in the john together.

832
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:23,440
You play
these little games.

833
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:28,040
I wish you could step
out of yourselves and just look.

834
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:31,780
- Why? Why are you so cruel?
- Because I love you.

835
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:34,050
You have a strange way
of showing it.

836
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:37,380
No, I love- I really
love you. Both of you.

837
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:39,480
And I admire you.

838
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:44,120
And I look at you,
and I listen to you and I think...

839
01:19:44,230 --> 01:19:46,530
you're never gonna grow.

840
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:49,530
You won't grow
like this. You won't.

841
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:53,730
Not as long as you keep clinging
to each other the way that you do.

842
01:19:56,310 --> 01:19:58,870
Isabelle, have you ever
been out on a date?

843
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:01,210
- A date?
- Yeah, a date.

844
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:04,080
- What kind of date?
- You ever been out with a boy?

845
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:07,010
- I've been out with Theo.
- Not Theo.

846
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,180
Have you ever been
out with a boy...

847
01:20:09,290 --> 01:20:11,250
that you met at school
that you liked?

848
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:14,380
I was never taken to school prom,
if that's what you mean.

849
01:20:14,490 --> 01:20:17,020
I'm afraid we don't have
proms in France.

850
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:19,090
You have dates
in France, Isabelle.

851
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,600
Come on. Have you ever
been out with a boy?

852
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:24,930
Why do you keep asking me that?
You know I haven't.

853
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:27,330
Would you like to?

854
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:30,170
- Is this an invitation?
- It's an invitation.

855
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:32,900
Would you like to go
out on a date with me?

856
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:36,000
Just the two of us.
Don't look at Theo.

857
01:20:36,110 --> 01:20:39,600
Isabelle, you don't
need his permission.

858
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:17,140
Oh, no, no, no. We can't sit in the front.
We have to sit in the back.

859
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:20,270
The front is for people
who don't have dates.

860
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:22,620
Ooh. Sorry. Excuse me.

861
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:28,560
- Chocolats glaces, cacahuetes, bonbons.
- So we sit in the back.

862
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:46,070
Ladies and gentlemen...

863
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:49,610
the motion picture
you are about to see...

864
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:52,110
is a story of music.

865
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:55,310
I play the role
of Tom Miller, an agent-

866
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:58,820
a small-time theatrical agent
who had been a-

867
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:02,190
Well, you'll see.

868
01:22:02,290 --> 01:22:07,390
This motion picture was photographed
in the grandeur of CinemaScope, and-

869
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:12,060
Pardon me.

870
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:30,040
Sorry. I can't stay,
but I have a train on tap.

871
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:33,180
All the best, Jerri.

872
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:36,350
Can't stand to hear me
sing again, huh?

873
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:40,480
You know it isn't that.

874
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,790
When I looked at the TV screen...

875
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:59,590
I remembered the battle
of the Cinematheque.

876
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:03,630
Except this time the demonstrators
weren't film buffs.

877
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:07,400
They weren't even
just students any longer.

878
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:10,410
It was hard to figure out
what was happening...

879
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:14,240
but it looked like shops had closed
their doors, factories had gone on strike.

880
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:19,280
And it was beginning
to spread all over Paris.

881
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:22,250
We're willing to consider...

882
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:24,840
all legitimate demands.

883
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:29,720
Theo and I never watch
television. We're purists.

884
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:31,920
The purest of the pure.

885
01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:35,400
- Well, let's go.
- Yeah, but-

886
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:39,300
Jesus.

887
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,910
- What's wrong?
- They're not mine.

888
01:25:47,730 --> 01:25:50,030
No, no, no. Your room.

889
01:25:50,130 --> 01:25:53,470
- No.
- I don't know how long I've been here, but in all that time...

890
01:25:53,570 --> 01:25:57,100
I haven't-
I haven't seen your room.

891
01:25:57,210 --> 01:26:00,270
- You do have a room, right?
- Yeah, yeah. Of course I have.

892
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:02,370
Don't think I've always
lived in Theo's pigsty.

893
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:05,210
- How come you never go in there?
How come we never- - No, no, no.

894
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:07,980
No, no one's making
love on my bed.

895
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,550
- Oh, please? Come on. It's your room. It's part of you.
- No. No. No. No.

896
01:26:10,650 --> 01:26:13,280
- I want to see it. Just tonight.
- No. No.

897
01:26:13,390 --> 01:26:15,880
Non, non, et non.

898
01:26:32,410 --> 01:26:35,840
I discovered a side of Isabelle
I'd never seen before...

899
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:40,210
a secret side
she hadn't wanted me to see.

900
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:44,080
I suddenly thought of my sisters'
bedrooms in San Diego.

901
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:46,380
I thought of our house,
and our neighbors' houses...

902
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:49,010
all alike,
and their green lawns...

903
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:52,780
and their sprinklers and their station
wagons parked outside the garage door.

904
01:27:45,210 --> 01:27:48,270
What sculpture?

905
01:27:50,810 --> 01:27:54,440
I always wanted to make love
to the Venus de Milo.

906
01:27:57,750 --> 01:28:02,080
- I can't stop you.

907
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:05,920
I've got no arms.

908
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:10,290
I can't stop you!

909
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:49,130
What's wrong?

910
01:28:49,230 --> 01:28:51,530
- What's wrong?

911
01:28:51,630 --> 01:28:54,600
Don't. Don't.

912
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:58,000
Don't.
Don't listen to it.

913
01:28:58,110 --> 01:29:00,470
Don't listen to it.
Don't cry.

914
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:03,200
- Shh!

915
01:29:03,310 --> 01:29:06,280
- Don't.
- Please. Leave me alone.

916
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:09,610
Leave me alone.
Please. Please.

917
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:13,050
- Please!

918
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:19,350
- Go away!
- Isabelle! Isabelle!

919
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:23,660
Theo! Open up! Theo!
- Isabelle!

920
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:28,360
- Theo!
- You're gonna hurt yourself! You're gonna hurtyourself!

921
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:31,700
- Who are you?
- What? What are you talking about?

922
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:34,570
- What are you doing in my room!
- What do you mean, what-

923
01:29:34,670 --> 01:29:37,570
Get out! Get out!

924
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:41,630
- Theo! Theo! Theo!

925
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:43,710
- Theo! Theo!

926
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:48,720
Theo!

927
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,190
Theo!

928
01:30:13,270 --> 01:30:15,640
A revolution isn't a gala dinner.

929
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:20,470
It cannot be created like a book,
a drawing or a tapestry..

930
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:24,840
It cannot unfold with such elegance,
tranquillity and delicacy...

931
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:27,510
or with such sweetness,
affability, courtesy...

932
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:30,590
restraint and generosity.

933
01:30:30,690 --> 01:30:32,660
A revolution
is an uprising...

934
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:34,550
a violent act...

935
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:37,960
by which one class
overthrows another.

936
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:29,170
Chateau Lafite, 1955.

937
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:36,380
Chateau Chasse Spleen, 1959.

938
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:40,710
Grand vin, 1937.
Happy Birthday, Papa!

939
01:31:41,890 --> 01:31:44,580
- Uh, good.

940
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:48,420
- Listen, Matthew.
- Yes?

941
01:31:48,530 --> 01:31:51,690
- You're a big movie buff, right?
- Oui.

942
01:31:51,790 --> 01:31:54,730
Then why don't you think of Mao
as a great director...

943
01:31:56,530 --> 01:31:58,970
making a movie with
a cast of millions.

944
01:31:59,070 --> 01:32:02,200
All those millions
of Red Guards...

945
01:32:02,310 --> 01:32:05,870
marching together
into the future...

946
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:08,740
with the Little Red Book
in their hands.

947
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:12,680
Books, not guns.

948
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:16,050
Culture, not violence.

949
01:32:16,150 --> 01:32:20,710
Can't you see what a beautiful,
epic movie that would make?

950
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:22,810
I guess, but...

951
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:25,360
it's easy to say,
"Books, not guns."

952
01:32:25,460 --> 01:32:28,690
But it's not true.
It's not books.

953
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,820
It's "book." A book.
Just one book.

954
01:32:32,930 --> 01:32:35,230
- Shut up. You sound just like my father.
- No, no.

955
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:37,860
No, listen to me.
The Red Guards...

956
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:40,000
that you admire...

957
01:32:40,110 --> 01:32:42,170
they all carry
the same book...

958
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:44,500
they all sing
the same songs...

959
01:32:44,610 --> 01:32:47,170
they all parrot
the same slogans.

960
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:52,180
So in this big,
epic movie...

961
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:55,150
everybody...
is an extra.

962
01:32:56,690 --> 01:33:00,250
That's scary. to me.
That gives me the creeps.

963
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:03,560
I'm sorry to say it,
but for me there is...

964
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:06,560
a distinct contradiction.

965
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:09,000
Why?

966
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:13,590
Because... if you really
believed what you were saying...

967
01:33:13,710 --> 01:33:15,700
you'd be out there.

968
01:33:15,810 --> 01:33:20,110
- Where?
- Out there, on the street.

969
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:23,910
- I don't know what you mean.
- Yes, you do. There's something going on out there.

970
01:33:24,010 --> 01:33:27,570
Something that feels like
it could be really important.

971
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,670
Something that feels like
things could change.

972
01:33:29,790 --> 01:33:33,240
Even I get that.
But you're not out there.

973
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:38,350
You're inside, with me, drinking
expensive wine, talking about film.

974
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:41,790
- Talking about Maoism. Why?
- Okay. That's enough.

975
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:45,230
- No, tell me why. Ask yourself why.
- That's enough.

976
01:33:45,330 --> 01:33:48,130
Because I don't think
you really believe it.

977
01:33:48,230 --> 01:33:52,230
I think you buy the lamp, and you put
up the posters, but I don't-

978
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:54,570
I don't think you-

979
01:33:54,670 --> 01:33:57,470
- You speak... too much.
- Okay.

980
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:02,780
Theo! Just listen to me.
Listen.

981
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:07,050
I think-
I think you prefer-

982
01:34:07,150 --> 01:34:11,090
I think you prefer
when- when-

983
01:34:11,190 --> 01:34:17,390
when the word "together"
means not "a million," but just two.

984
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:21,400
- Oh-oh-oh, boys, boys!
- Or three?

985
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:30,740
- Isa. Come and join us.
- No, thank you, my sweet.

986
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:32,570
It smells like a whorehouse.

987
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:34,370
Thanks a lot.

988
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:37,570
I've got a surprise for you.
In the salon.

989
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:52,920
- It's beautiful.
- Hey, come on! Get in!

990
01:35:01,870 --> 01:35:04,200
We used to do this
when we were little.

991
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:06,300
Ow!

992
01:35:06,410 --> 01:35:10,210
More wine.

993
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:12,780
Thank you.

994
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:17,510
Isabelle.

995
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:20,050
Oh! God,
your breath is foul!

996
01:35:20,150 --> 01:35:22,380
- Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry.

997
01:35:22,490 --> 01:35:24,460
- You're drunk!

998
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:26,680
Yes, I'm drunk.

999
01:35:26,790 --> 01:35:28,620
And you're beautiful.

1000
01:35:28,730 --> 01:35:32,390
And tomorrow morning,
I'll be sober...

1001
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:36,130
butyou'll
still be beautiful.

1002
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:41,970
- Eh, bien.
- Go to sleep, Matthew.

1003
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:44,100
Yes.

1004
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:50,440
Idiot...

1005
01:35:50,550 --> 01:35:52,640
you can hardly keep
your eyes open.

1006
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:03,450
Night-night.

1007
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:18,670
Theo? Theo?

1008
01:36:20,610 --> 01:36:21,840
Wake up.

1009
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:26,210
What is it?

1010
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:28,810
I want you to listen.

1011
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:31,880
- Why?
- Because.

1012
01:36:33,490 --> 01:36:36,920
- Theo-
- Mm?

1013
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:39,820
I love you.
You know that?

1014
01:36:39,930 --> 01:36:41,990
I love you too.

1015
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:46,200
You love me too?
That's funny.

1016
01:36:48,770 --> 01:36:51,070
Are you listening?

1017
01:36:51,170 --> 01:36:55,200
It's forever, right?

1018
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:58,240
- What's forever?
- The two of us.

1019
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:01,700
- Right?
- Yes.

1020
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:05,410
Why did Matthew
say that?

1021
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:08,180
What did Matthew say?

1022
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:11,740
That we're monsters,
freaks.

1023
01:37:13,660 --> 01:37:17,560
I just want you to tell me
that it's forever.

1024
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:19,490
It's forever.

1025
01:37:20,530 --> 01:37:22,860
- Isa!
- You don't understand.

1026
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:25,400
We'll talk about it
in the morning.

1027
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,270
I promise.

1028
01:37:53,530 --> 01:37:55,550
Oh!

1029
01:39:24,210 --> 01:39:27,370
Good. We must
leave now, darling.

1030
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:31,110
- Already?
- What would you like? To have dinner with them?

1031
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,660
Let's leave on tiptoe.

1032
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:14,830
Isa? What's happening?

1033
01:45:14,930 --> 01:45:17,930
- The street came flying into the room!
- What?

1034
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:19,400
The street came flying
into the room!

1035
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:22,130
- What's that smell?
- It's tear gas.

1036
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:49,360
- Hit the streets!
- Go! Go on!

1037
01:46:00,610 --> 01:46:02,470
Hit the streets!

1038
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:10,250
Matthew!

1039
01:46:10,350 --> 01:46:12,980
Isabelle!

1040
01:46:14,590 --> 01:46:16,680
Isabelle!

1041
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:22,020
- Hi!
- Hi!

1042
01:46:24,430 --> 01:46:28,490
Dans la rue! Dans la rue!
Dans la rue! Dans la rue!

1043
01:46:41,780 --> 01:46:44,750
This is just the start.
The fight goes on!

1044
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:04,100
- Theo, this is wrong. This is wrong.
- No, this is wonderful!

1045
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:06,170
This is violence!
This is violence.

1046
01:47:06,270 --> 01:47:08,460
It's not violence. It's wonderful.
Come with me!

1047
01:47:08,570 --> 01:47:10,730
This is fucking fascism
in a fucking bottle!

1048
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:13,170
I'm no fascist!
The cops are fascists!

1049
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:16,730
- Yeah, and then police hit people!
- Shut up!

1050
01:47:16,850 --> 01:47:19,280
You can't understand.
Leave me be!

1051
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:22,220
Listen to me for a second, okay?
This is what they do.

1052
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:24,650
This is not what we do.
We use this.

1053
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:29,380
- We do this. We use this. We use this!
- Stop it!

1054
01:47:33,590 --> 01:47:36,220
Isabelle. Come on.

1055
01:47:36,330 --> 01:47:38,390
Isa-

1056
01:47:39,305 --> 01:48:39,272
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
