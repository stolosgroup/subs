00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,160
<i>It's hard not to feel lucky.</i>

4
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:16,476
<i>Though Dad says
there's no such thing.</i>

5
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:29,356
<i>There's those who are prepared
for opportunities and setbacks,</i>

6
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,559
<i>and those who are not.</i>

7
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:36,864
<i>Luck doesn't exist.</i>

8
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:53,347
<i>After the wars,
it was very obvious</i>

9
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,750
<i>who was prepared
and who wasn't.</i>

10
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:03,858
<i>Man had fallen far away
from his primitive roots.</i>

11
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,869
<i>We forgot how to do
the most basic of things.</i>

12
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:18,640
<i>Like getting food.</i>

13
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:22,275
<i>I still don't know
what it means,</i>

14
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,846
<i>but apparently everything
was wrapped in plastic</i>

15
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,380
<i>and ready to go.</i>

16
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,685
<i>Dad loves that saying.</i>

17
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:41,562
<i>We don't disagree
on much of anything.</i>

18
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,412
<i>I feel real lucky
to have the dad I do.</i>

19
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:06,486
Jakey?

20
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,335
How'd you go?

21
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,906
Decent...
for end of season.

22
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:26,974
Six cohos, a couple dogs.

23
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:29,309
- It's in the smoker?
- Yeah.

24
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,344
Cold chamber's
leaking pretty bad.

25
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,515
I patched it up, but I think
it needs a proper redo.

26
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:37,552
Put it on the list.

27
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,386
Already did.

28
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,991
The supper's on the stove
heating up.

29
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:45,727
I'll be in shortly.

30
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:54,468
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

31
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,369
Let me in! Let me in!

32
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,639
Don't look at him.
Don't look at him! Come here!

33
00:03:58,673 --> 00:04:00,541
Jake!

34
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:02,643
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

35
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:08,516
You okay, Jakey?

36
00:04:11,953 --> 00:04:13,420
The dream...

37
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,793
You know the wars
are in the past.

38
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,831
We gotta do something
to erase these memories.

39
00:04:23,865 --> 00:04:28,836
Focus on the future
and bury the past.

40
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,037
Okay?

41
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,607
Need a hand, old man?

42
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:08,341
I'm good.

43
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,510
You sure?

44
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,581
I can have half a cord of wood
chopped before you get back.

45
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,116
You're dreaming.

46
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,851
Loser cooks and cleans.

47
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:18,019
Deal!

48
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:32,533
This ax is sharp. Well done.

49
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,505
Get in the house.

50
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:45,680
You stay here.
Anyone comes through that door,

51
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:47,582
- shoot them in the face!
- Dad, I can help.

52
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:49,416
I can take these SOBs out.

53
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,954
You are gonna stay here
and protect what's ours.

54
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:54,689
I'll sweep the perimeter.

55
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:57,892
If I'm not back in 30 minutes,
you know what to do.

56
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:17,972
Fuck this.

57
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,772
You good?

58
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,176
Yeah. Yeah.

59
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:58,879
He got a couple of rounds off,
but he's a lousy shot.

60
00:08:03,718 --> 00:08:05,619
You're early.

61
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:07,722
I heard the shots.
I just wanted to help.

62
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:11,726
Your time will come
to bury plenty of men.

63
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,162
It's just as important
for you to stay,

64
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:16,731
keep our home safe.

65
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:18,132
I'm ready now.

66
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,934
I know.

67
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,769
And I think
we're getting too comfortable.

68
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,838
He was on his way to our cabin.

69
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:29,176
When we're not prepared, we'll
be the ones getting buried.

70
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:33,280
Now, you take care
of this SOB.

71
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:37,551
I'm gonna go back to the cabin
and get cleaned up.

72
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:38,953
Dad!

73
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:41,655
- What?
- You're bleeding.

74
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:42,990
Fuck.

75
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,260
Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry.

76
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:51,032
You... You finish up here
and meet me back at the cabin.

77
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:57,271
Go on! This is not a democracy.

78
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:15,790
You piece of shit.

79
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:31,772
Tell my daughter...

80
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:35,176
I love her.

81
00:09:58,365 --> 00:09:59,733
How are you feeling?

82
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:01,235
I told you to stop worrying.

83
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:04,905
And stop asking.

84
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:08,075
Not a big deal.
It's just a 9mm.

85
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,914
Dad, you know
in <i>The Swiss Family Robinson,</i>

86
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:15,983
the father prays
to the god for safety,

87
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,985
and then they find the island.

88
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:20,087
God didn't point them there?

89
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:22,990
No, Jake.

90
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:26,894
The point was to show
how desperate he was.

91
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:30,131
Talking to the fictitious
in survival mode.

92
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:33,434
And besides, it's just a story.

93
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,870
A story about...

94
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,105
finding utopia...

95
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:41,075
away from humanity
and all its evils.

96
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:47,848
Why are you drawing that?

97
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,386
That man had it written
on his chest.

98
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,021
And?

99
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,993
The outsiders still believe
in the religion?

100
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:04,198
I'm sure the poor and the
desperate still cling on to it.

101
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,069
How can they go through the wars
and still believe?

102
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:11,872
You gotta think, for the masses,

103
00:11:11,906 --> 00:11:13,841
it's all they got left, right?

104
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,012
Hope for the hopeless,
that's all.

105
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:31,225
Hey, Jakey, come here.
Don't be scared.

106
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,961
This man can't hurt us anymore.

107
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:35,863
What if more bad men come?

108
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,498
Well, then we'll
have to be prepared.

109
00:11:37,532 --> 00:11:41,869
But you just can't be scared,
Jakey, otherwise they get you.

110
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:43,304
They're just not like us.

111
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:46,240
Just don't
look them in the eye...

112
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:49,210
- and then you'll be fine.
- Why?

113
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:51,445
'Cause if you look them
in the eye,

114
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:56,150
they'll trick you into thinking
that they're still human.

115
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,452
Don't you ever forget that.

116
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:29,109
You okay?

117
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:32,079
Yeah, I'm good.

118
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:34,014
I told you to quit asking.

119
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,852
How many traps you set today?

120
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:40,254
Seven.

121
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:43,190
Try and get a dozen
by the end of the day, okay?

122
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,345
Dad?

123
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:11,118
Dad!

124
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:15,489
Dad!

125
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:20,327
Come here, come here.

126
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:27,368
What can I do?

127
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:30,437
Boil some water
and get me some whiskey.

128
00:14:34,676 --> 00:14:37,378
Get some gauze
out of the first aid kit.

129
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:42,349
It's all gone.

130
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,485
Get the cleanest rags
you can find

131
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,521
and put them
in the boiling water.

132
00:14:52,594 --> 00:14:55,028
We have everything we need.

133
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:58,098
This is our home now...
and forever.

134
00:14:58,132 --> 00:15:00,300
What about Mom?

135
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:02,269
Is she never coming back?

136
00:15:03,705 --> 00:15:05,205
Jakey...

137
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:08,643
Mom's dead.

138
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,646
She's not coming back.

139
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:15,349
They killed her.

140
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:18,452
Do you understand?

141
00:15:19,721 --> 00:15:21,155
I hate them.

142
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,159
You don't fill your heart
with hate, son.

143
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:28,429
We have each other.

144
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:31,566
And I will protect you
until the day I die.

145
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:03,163
How is it?

146
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:10,170
Jakey...

147
00:16:11,706 --> 00:16:14,007
you listen carefully.

148
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:22,349
The antibiotics are too old.

149
00:16:23,618 --> 00:16:24,752
Here, take these keys.

150
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,490
Go to the caches.

151
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:35,496
Jakey, if I'm too weak...

152
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,233
and the outsiders come...

153
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:43,671
you gotta shoot to kill.

154
00:16:43,705 --> 00:16:48,041
If anybody steps a foot on
our land, I'll kill them dead.

155
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:50,612
Go to the cache
by the big spruce...

156
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,382
and get the SHTF book.

157
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:18,673
Five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten.

158
00:18:00,648 --> 00:18:01,783
Are you ready for this?

159
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:06,186
Yeah.

160
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,856
You need to know you're ready.

161
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:12,894
You gotta feel it
in your bones.

162
00:18:12,927 --> 00:18:14,394
I know, Dad.

163
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:19,266
You're a better shot
than your old man.

164
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,736
You need to be ready...

165
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:23,504
to bury anybody
you come across.

166
00:18:23,538 --> 00:18:25,840
Are you ready for that?

167
00:18:25,873 --> 00:18:28,408
Dad, I'm ready. I can do this.

168
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:31,378
Then you tell me
you will put a bullet

169
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,380
between the eyes
of any person you see.

170
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:37,217
- Any man that I see.
- Man, woman or child.

171
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,886
They'll all kill you
just the same.

172
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,389
Do not underestimate them,
or you won't make it back alive.

173
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:46,460
Don't let them
make the first move.

174
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:50,430
Dad, I got this.

175
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,701
You're gonna be okay.
I promise.

176
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:00,808
Go.

177
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:37,344
<i>This is really
important, Jakey.</i>

178
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,514
<i>This is
our first line of defense.</i>

179
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:43,283
<i>The outside world is full</i>

180
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:46,386
<i>of filthy
and desperate people</i>

181
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,290
<i>who will shoot us
dead on sight.</i>

182
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:53,393
There are gangs of marauders

183
00:19:53,427 --> 00:19:56,329
roaming around
in gas-powered vehicles,

184
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,331
ready to take anyone away.

185
00:19:58,365 --> 00:19:59,734
Even kids?

186
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:01,301
Especially kids.

187
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:03,403
There are cities and major towns

188
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:05,372
that have been burnt
to the ground

189
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,742
and women and children
burned alive.

190
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:11,813
- Why?
- Because people are desperate

191
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:13,781
and ill-prepared.

192
00:20:13,815 --> 00:20:17,552
They will burn our house down
with us in it

193
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:20,555
just for a gun
or a piece of food.

194
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:24,826
That's why I brought us
all the way up here.

195
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:27,461
<i>We're gonna be safe here
for a long time.</i>

196
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:10,805
Mmm.

197
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:21,829
Hey!

198
00:24:37,044 --> 00:24:39,213
I got the antibiotics
and steroids.

199
00:24:39,246 --> 00:24:40,781
Jakey?

200
00:24:43,017 --> 00:24:45,186
Here.

201
00:24:45,219 --> 00:24:46,587
Hey.

202
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,289
Anyone see you?

203
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:50,257
No. Nobody saw me.

204
00:24:55,563 --> 00:24:57,131
Did you see outsiders?

205
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,968
Yeah.

206
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,105
And?

207
00:25:06,607 --> 00:25:08,009
I killed 'em dead.

208
00:25:11,078 --> 00:25:12,613
How many?

209
00:25:12,646 --> 00:25:13,848
Where?

210
00:25:16,283 --> 00:25:17,651
Just a lady.

211
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:19,587
At the medicine place.

212
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,322
No men?

213
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:22,923
No others?

214
00:25:22,957 --> 00:25:24,592
There were fresh tracks
and food.

215
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,727
If they were there, they
were probably out hunting. Here.

216
00:25:26,761 --> 00:25:27,995
I scoped the area for a day

217
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:29,830
before sniping the women
and breaching.

218
00:25:34,969 --> 00:25:37,071
You're sure
you weren't followed?

219
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:43,077
Yeah. I doubled back twice
before the snowfall. I'm sure.

220
00:25:52,253 --> 00:25:55,756
It'll be too dangerous
to go back there for a while.

221
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,762
You see any supplies?

222
00:26:03,898 --> 00:26:06,600
No. I didn't see any real value.

223
00:26:06,634 --> 00:26:09,670
Their perimeter and defenses
were nonexistent.

224
00:26:09,703 --> 00:26:11,338
I don't even think
they had guns.

225
00:26:12,873 --> 00:26:14,775
Everyone has guns.

226
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:20,081
Hey, Jakey.

227
00:26:24,718 --> 00:26:26,821
You did real good.

228
00:28:01,782 --> 00:28:03,217
But it's impossible.

229
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:07,254
There should be
half a rack of jerky left.

230
00:28:07,288 --> 00:28:09,456
Just the salmon stuff
we made the other day.

231
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,258
I just checked.

232
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:14,228
But I know there was
half a rack of jerky in there.

233
00:28:16,397 --> 00:28:18,265
Maybe the wolves got in.

234
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:21,268
- I told you to patch that up.
- I did.

235
00:28:21,302 --> 00:28:23,437
Maybe they outsmarted us again.

236
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,272
Fuck.

237
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:28,209
We're gonna need to get
some red meat before winter.

238
00:28:29,977 --> 00:28:31,212
I'll go.

239
00:28:32,413 --> 00:28:33,914
Dad, I can handle it.

240
00:28:33,948 --> 00:28:36,283
I got the antibiotics,
didn't I?

241
00:28:36,317 --> 00:28:39,787
I just don't want us making
any more unnecessary risks

242
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,989
- with me being hurt and all.
- Dad,

243
00:28:42,022 --> 00:28:43,357
I got it.

244
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:47,061
I'll patch the cellar up
before I head out.

245
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:50,197
You're right.

246
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:54,468
Sometimes I forget
you've grown into a man.

247
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:59,273
Don't you go near
that farm, though.

248
00:29:01,242 --> 00:29:04,178
They'll be looking for
the people that wronged 'em.

249
00:29:04,211 --> 00:29:07,448
I won't. I'll head out north.

250
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,572
Are there others here?

251
00:30:07,107 --> 00:30:09,143
What are you
doing in my house?

252
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:13,314
Are there others here?

253
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:19,621
- Please don't kill me.
- I said, are there others here?

254
00:30:19,654 --> 00:30:21,221
No.

255
00:30:21,255 --> 00:30:23,123
You're not lying, are you?

256
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:26,594
No.

257
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:39,507
Did you tell others about me?

258
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:41,241
Did you follow me?

259
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:47,481
What are you doing here?

260
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:53,053
I don't know.

261
00:30:59,661 --> 00:31:01,495
Then why don't you just leave?

262
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:05,567
I'm not afraid to kill you.

263
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,401
What do you want?

264
00:31:16,176 --> 00:31:17,612
I came to meet you.

265
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:25,587
Do you have a name?

266
00:31:30,124 --> 00:31:31,358
Jake.

267
00:31:33,494 --> 00:31:35,262
I'm Henrietta.

268
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:41,435
Do you want
to get those clothes dry?

269
00:31:43,103 --> 00:31:45,172
Maybe take a hot shower?

270
00:31:47,141 --> 00:31:49,577
I'll finish making some food,
and then maybe you can tell me

271
00:31:49,611 --> 00:31:54,415
why you're standing in my house
pointing a gun at me.

272
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,120
No!

273
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:37,191
Aah! It's too hot!

274
00:32:37,224 --> 00:32:38,693
Fix it or I'll break it.

275
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:47,501
Did you turn the handle
on the right?

276
00:34:40,213 --> 00:34:42,517
What did you do with my gun?

277
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,319
- I hid it.
- Why'd you do that?

278
00:34:45,352 --> 00:34:48,488
Please just leave,
for God's sakes.

279
00:34:48,523 --> 00:34:51,325
I could kill you
just as easily with this.

280
00:34:53,193 --> 00:34:55,697
If you're gonna do it,
just do it already.

281
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:03,638
Are you done?

282
00:35:05,372 --> 00:35:07,709
Don't touch my gun again.

283
00:35:09,711 --> 00:35:12,513
I'll give it to you
when you leave.

284
00:35:12,547 --> 00:35:15,817
- Now the knife. Hand it over.
- How can I trust you?

285
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:20,354
I'm trusting you
by letting you be in my home.

286
00:35:20,387 --> 00:35:23,256
Now show me the same respect.

287
00:35:36,938 --> 00:35:38,840
You're not a killer, are you?

288
00:35:39,974 --> 00:35:41,909
I can be if I need to be.

289
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:45,647
Okay.

290
00:35:54,522 --> 00:35:55,657
Mmm.

291
00:35:57,457 --> 00:35:59,694
A man without a gun is nothing.

292
00:36:01,729 --> 00:36:05,298
Well, I don't like them
in my house,

293
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:07,568
especially ones
pointed at my face.

294
00:36:08,936 --> 00:36:11,371
I'll give it back to you
when you leave.

295
00:36:14,408 --> 00:36:16,711
- Is that plastic?
- Yeah.

296
00:36:16,744 --> 00:36:18,311
Glad wrap.

297
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:19,814
Is it ready to go?

298
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:25,485
Uh...

299
00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:28,856
ready to go in the fridge.

300
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:33,995
See?

301
00:36:34,028 --> 00:36:37,464
Was that you
snooping around here last week?

302
00:36:39,466 --> 00:36:40,902
Do you wanna share why?

303
00:36:42,737 --> 00:36:44,404
Medicine.

304
00:36:44,438 --> 00:36:45,973
Well, what for?

305
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:49,677
My dad got
a pretty bad infection,

306
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:51,411
and we were low on preps.

307
00:36:52,547 --> 00:36:56,718
Well, why didn't you just ask?

308
00:36:58,686 --> 00:37:01,455
Because I wasn't sure
if you were dangerous.

309
00:37:02,857 --> 00:37:05,593
Then how do you know
that I'm not?

310
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:15,570
How do you survive here
without a gun?

311
00:37:16,871 --> 00:37:18,706
Pretty well, actually.

312
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,042
And what do you do
when outsiders come to attack?

313
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:23,945
Well, you're the first person
in my entire life

314
00:37:23,978 --> 00:37:26,948
that has ever
pointed a gun at me.

315
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:36,389
I've never had soup like this.

316
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:37,658
Mmm.

317
00:37:38,893 --> 00:37:40,061
Homegrown chilies.

318
00:37:40,094 --> 00:37:41,996
That's my secret ingredient.

319
00:37:43,965 --> 00:37:48,936
I think the cold, wet climate
up here makes them sweeter.

320
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:53,074
Granted, you have to grow them
in a greenhouse.

321
00:37:53,107 --> 00:37:56,944
Kind of like tricking them
into feeling safe and warm.

322
00:37:58,112 --> 00:37:59,847
I think I can taste it.

323
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:03,818
- Taste what?
- That you tricked them.

324
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:07,088
Into feeling safe and warm.

325
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:08,623
It's amazing.

326
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:13,528
So it's just you and your dad?

327
00:38:13,561 --> 00:38:16,764
There's no family or visitors?

328
00:38:16,798 --> 00:38:19,567
No. No. No one like us.

329
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,002
Just the outsiders.

330
00:38:23,137 --> 00:38:25,573
Tell me more
about how you live.

331
00:38:31,746 --> 00:38:33,581
I should really be going.

332
00:38:33,614 --> 00:38:36,483
Oh, wait, Jake,
you can stay the night.

333
00:38:36,517 --> 00:38:38,418
Just leave first thing
in the morning.

334
00:38:38,451 --> 00:38:39,987
You know, let your clothes dry.

335
00:38:40,021 --> 00:38:43,624
No, I have to get some venison.
I hid our jerky.

336
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:46,627
What? Why?

337
00:38:46,661 --> 00:38:49,096
Dad doesn't want contact
with outsiders.

338
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,966
So I had to get out
for a hunt without suspicion.

339
00:38:53,634 --> 00:38:57,672
Why doesn't your dad
want contact with outsiders?

340
00:38:57,705 --> 00:38:59,841
Because outsiders are dangerous.

341
00:39:06,747 --> 00:39:08,583
How's this look?

342
00:39:13,554 --> 00:39:14,856
It's frozen.

343
00:39:17,058 --> 00:39:18,793
It's ready to go.

344
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:23,130
Well, it's yours if you want.

345
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:26,499
Um, you can stay the night

346
00:39:26,534 --> 00:39:27,969
and wait out the storm

347
00:39:28,002 --> 00:39:30,771
and let your clothes dry
if you'd like.

348
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:53,761
I gotta head out.

349
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,765
Jake?

350
00:39:57,798 --> 00:40:00,067
Your gun is
in the kitchen cabinet.

351
00:40:01,602 --> 00:40:02,870
I found it.

352
00:40:06,507 --> 00:40:08,075
I hope your dad is okay.

353
00:40:12,647 --> 00:40:13,781
Thanks.

354
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,085
I hope to see you again.

355
00:40:19,754 --> 00:40:22,957
Well, you know where to find me.

356
00:40:36,237 --> 00:40:37,805
What took you so long?

357
00:40:39,874 --> 00:40:41,709
It's how long it took.

358
00:40:41,742 --> 00:40:44,679
Three days to go to the banks
and bag a doe?

359
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,181
No deer at the banks,

360
00:40:47,214 --> 00:40:49,717
so I had to hike to the meadows.

361
00:40:50,885 --> 00:40:52,186
That's where this is from?

362
00:40:53,888 --> 00:40:55,022
Yeah.

363
00:40:58,259 --> 00:40:59,827
Where's the rest?

364
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:05,566
I didn't get a clean shot.
Wolves got to the rest.

365
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,668
This was all I could salvage.

366
00:41:24,552 --> 00:41:26,654
How'd you make that clean cut?

367
00:41:29,623 --> 00:41:30,925
I used a saw.

368
00:41:32,927 --> 00:41:34,895
I stole it from that farm.

369
00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:13,567
Do you wanna press charges?

370
00:42:13,601 --> 00:42:14,969
No. I don't wanna press charges.

371
00:42:15,002 --> 00:42:16,804
I wanna know who he is.

372
00:42:18,105 --> 00:42:19,774
Did you ask him?

373
00:42:22,043 --> 00:42:26,680
Okay, uh, what I mean is,
I want to know if he's okay.

374
00:42:26,714 --> 00:42:30,117
- You said he's a grown man.
- Yes.

375
00:42:30,151 --> 00:42:33,087
To be frank, this department
doesn't have the manpower

376
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:37,324
to comb through the forest
because of some bad vibes.

377
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:39,026
In a 10-mile radius,

378
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:42,963
we have 72 drilling rigs
operated by miscreants

379
00:42:42,997 --> 00:42:45,699
who couldn't work
at a gas station.

380
00:42:45,733 --> 00:42:47,134
That leaves the four of us

381
00:42:47,168 --> 00:42:50,671
to police
a mob of drunk, angry boys

382
00:42:50,704 --> 00:42:54,241
who are gonna be gone in a month
when the season's over.

383
00:42:54,275 --> 00:42:56,710
You know, I've got...

384
00:42:56,744 --> 00:42:59,346
assault, rape, murder.

385
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,981
So it sounds like to me

386
00:43:01,015 --> 00:43:03,818
your mole person's
one of the good ones.

387
00:43:05,653 --> 00:43:07,354
- Jake.
- What?

388
00:43:07,388 --> 00:43:09,390
His name is Jake.

389
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:12,026
His father's name is Troy.

390
00:43:14,728 --> 00:43:16,997
I'm giving you my number.

391
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:19,200
I understand
that you're busy, and if...

392
00:43:19,233 --> 00:43:21,368
You know, just keep an ear out.

393
00:43:21,402 --> 00:43:23,938
Thank you
for the detailed account.

394
00:43:23,971 --> 00:43:26,874
- Thank you. Have a good day.
- Here to serve.

395
00:44:14,922 --> 00:44:16,157
What's this?

396
00:44:18,726 --> 00:44:20,294
I added chilies to it.

397
00:44:22,763 --> 00:44:25,065
Those are to keep the animals
off the garden.

398
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:26,834
- You know that, Jake.
- Yeah, I know,

399
00:44:26,867 --> 00:44:29,069
but it makes this taste amazing.

400
00:44:40,748 --> 00:44:41,916
Oh!

401
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:44,919
What are you doing?

402
00:44:47,121 --> 00:44:49,089
I wanted to try something new.

403
00:44:51,526 --> 00:44:53,360
What has gotten into you, Jake?

404
00:44:54,862 --> 00:44:56,197
What is going on?

405
00:44:57,932 --> 00:44:59,500
The Swiss Family Robinson
used oyster shells

406
00:44:59,534 --> 00:45:02,136
to eat mussels
and ate lobsters with biscuits.

407
00:45:02,169 --> 00:45:05,272
They have fun trying new things
and making feasts. Why can't we?

408
00:45:05,306 --> 00:45:06,473
We eat to live.

409
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:09,977
We don't live to eat, Jake.

410
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,079
You're being ridiculous.

411
00:45:12,112 --> 00:45:14,782
Families in <i>National Geographic</i>
have tables full of food,

412
00:45:14,815 --> 00:45:16,150
big spreads, end to end.

413
00:45:20,955 --> 00:45:22,223
What did you say?

414
00:45:24,124 --> 00:45:26,528
It was just something
I saw once.

415
00:45:26,561 --> 00:45:28,062
Where?

416
00:45:30,331 --> 00:45:32,299
I've been reading
some new books.

417
00:45:34,034 --> 00:45:37,838
- What books?
- Just stuff I've found myself.

418
00:45:37,871 --> 00:45:39,406
Stuff that I've scavenged

419
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,243
off the outsiders
you've shot over the years.

420
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:46,046
Show me.

421
00:45:56,056 --> 00:45:57,358
I said, show me.

422
00:46:04,331 --> 00:46:09,103
This make you feel good,
keeping this stuff from me?

423
00:46:09,136 --> 00:46:11,905
- You keep stuff from me.
- No, I do not!

424
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:13,407
I have never lied to you.

425
00:46:14,509 --> 00:46:15,876
Yeah, I'm not so sure.

426
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:18,078
Well, you should be.

427
00:46:18,112 --> 00:46:20,180
How do you know
that lady deserved to die?

428
00:46:20,214 --> 00:46:22,316
She was an outsider.

429
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:25,085
But how do you know
she deserved to die?

430
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:33,327
Jake, I know
you must be feeling bad

431
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,096
about killing that lady and all,

432
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,165
but you gotta know
it's for the best.

433
00:46:38,198 --> 00:46:41,268
You did what you had to do.
Don't second-guess it.

434
00:46:41,302 --> 00:46:43,437
It's just wasting valuable time.

435
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:48,175
I don't know
that I had to kill her.

436
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:49,511
What makes you say that?

437
00:46:49,544 --> 00:46:51,478
I think
she was harmless to us.

438
00:46:51,513 --> 00:46:54,081
I think she could have
maybe helped us.

439
00:46:54,114 --> 00:46:57,051
<i>Jakey, you have to understand</i>

440
00:46:57,084 --> 00:46:59,286
<i>that just because
she was a woman,</i>

441
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,255
<i>it doesn't change anything.</i>

442
00:47:01,288 --> 00:47:03,625
<i>Outsiders are outsiders.</i>

443
00:47:03,658 --> 00:47:07,061
<i>They're a plague
that'll ruin our world.</i>

444
00:47:07,094 --> 00:47:09,263
I think I could have
brought her back here,

445
00:47:09,296 --> 00:47:12,966
started a family,
like the Swiss Family Robinson.

446
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,202
Are you serious?

447
00:47:15,235 --> 00:47:17,204
What if you die, Dad?

448
00:47:17,237 --> 00:47:19,507
I need to be able to finish
what you started here.

449
00:47:19,541 --> 00:47:22,209
Have a family,
like you and Mom had me.

450
00:47:24,311 --> 00:47:26,080
Well, maybe you're right.

451
00:47:27,515 --> 00:47:29,350
I wouldn't have anything
without you.

452
00:47:31,418 --> 00:47:35,089
Maybe we need to start preparing
you for a future without me.

453
00:47:37,257 --> 00:47:40,294
I'm not trying
to upset you, Dad.

454
00:47:40,327 --> 00:47:43,197
I'm just trying to prepare
like you've taught me.

455
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,535
We can go look together,

456
00:47:47,569 --> 00:47:49,903
when I'm better.

457
00:47:49,937 --> 00:47:53,207
I mean, you're not gonna know
what you're looking at.

458
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,543
I don't want you
getting your hopes up either.

459
00:47:57,244 --> 00:47:59,213
They're all lying whores.

460
00:48:41,756 --> 00:48:43,558
I found the missing jerky.

461
00:48:45,392 --> 00:48:48,195
Oh, yeah? Whereabouts?

462
00:48:48,228 --> 00:48:51,365
It was out past the creek.

463
00:48:51,398 --> 00:48:55,068
A raccoon must have
buried it for safekeeping.

464
00:48:55,102 --> 00:48:59,541
- Raccoons don't bury their food.
- No, they don't, do they?

465
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,547
You wanna tell me
what the fuck is going on?

466
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:15,222
You are gonna clean this

467
00:49:15,255 --> 00:49:17,391
until I know you're sorry
about lying to me.

468
00:49:17,424 --> 00:49:21,495
- Might be a while.
- What has gotten into you?

469
00:49:21,529 --> 00:49:23,363
Nothing.

470
00:49:23,397 --> 00:49:25,332
Absolutely nothing.

471
00:49:25,365 --> 00:49:28,101
Your whole attitude has changed.

472
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:29,704
Are you sure
there's not something

473
00:49:29,737 --> 00:49:31,506
you want to admit to me?

474
00:49:33,207 --> 00:49:34,609
No, sir.

475
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,682
Have you seen outsiders?

476
00:49:40,715 --> 00:49:43,016
- No.
- Jake.

477
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:45,753
- Have you seen outsiders?
- No!

478
00:49:45,787 --> 00:49:48,388
None besides the one
you had me shoot dead!

479
00:49:49,757 --> 00:49:52,292
Are you 100 percent
sure she's dead?

480
00:49:52,326 --> 00:49:54,629
She's dead, Dad.

481
00:49:54,662 --> 00:49:56,230
Dead like Mom.

482
00:49:56,263 --> 00:49:57,665
What is happening to you?

483
00:49:57,699 --> 00:49:59,233
It's not
what's happening to me.

484
00:49:59,266 --> 00:50:01,068
It's what you said
it was out there.

485
00:50:01,101 --> 00:50:03,505
- What...? What about it?
- I've seen people and places,

486
00:50:03,538 --> 00:50:06,473
and it is not the chaos and
marauders that you've described.

487
00:50:06,508 --> 00:50:09,209
Jakey, you haven't seen shit.

488
00:50:09,243 --> 00:50:11,411
We're miles away
from the real shit.

489
00:50:11,445 --> 00:50:14,248
Why do you think I brought you
all the way up here?

490
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:16,584
To keep you safe.

491
00:50:16,618 --> 00:50:18,452
Away from the chaos.

492
00:50:20,588 --> 00:50:24,258
You want to ruin everything
that I've built for us here?

493
00:50:27,662 --> 00:50:31,164
- I think you're wrong.
- Where the hell are you going?

494
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:33,133
- To bring her back.
- Bring who back?

495
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:35,168
I'm gonna show you, Dad.
She's okay.

496
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:38,740
Wait. You're the one
who's in the wrong here, Jake!

497
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,677
I just don't want you
to get hurt!

498
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:44,812
Dad, if you are
ever going to trust me,

499
00:50:44,846 --> 00:50:46,514
then you need to let me go.

500
00:50:47,782 --> 00:50:49,416
I'm a grown man.

501
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,420
Jakey?

502
00:51:55,415 --> 00:51:56,818
Freshwater mussels.

503
00:51:56,851 --> 00:51:59,654
You dove for those
without a wetsuit?

504
00:51:59,687 --> 00:52:00,922
Yeah.

505
00:52:00,955 --> 00:52:02,624
A place I call the Wall.

506
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:06,594
Were you freezing?

507
00:52:06,628 --> 00:52:10,197
I was a little cold,
but I had a fire waiting.

508
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:11,699
It's been snowing.

509
00:52:11,733 --> 00:52:14,501
How do you make a fire
in the snow?

510
00:52:21,709 --> 00:52:23,945
<i>Yellow cedar
shaving will light a fire</i>

511
00:52:23,978 --> 00:52:25,913
<i>even when it's raining hard.</i>

512
00:52:32,486 --> 00:52:34,421
<i>I've got a lighter
for emergencies,</i>

513
00:52:34,454 --> 00:52:36,423
<i>but I don't like to use it.</i>

514
00:52:38,258 --> 00:52:40,728
<i>Not when everything I need
can be scavenged.</i>

515
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:48,703
We made fire!

516
00:52:57,011 --> 00:53:00,782
<i>Plus, the drill could
save your life.</i>

517
00:53:00,815 --> 00:53:02,583
<i>The drill?</i>

518
00:53:04,284 --> 00:53:05,687
<i>To set traps.</i>

519
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,356
<i>Better to be prepared than not.</i>

520
00:53:09,389 --> 00:53:11,693
<i>I don't need any traps.</i>

521
00:53:14,294 --> 00:53:15,797
<i>Just in case.</i>

522
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:17,832
<i>I like knowing
you're protected.</i>

523
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:25,773
<i>Freshwater mussels.</i>

524
00:53:27,709 --> 00:53:30,678
<i>Dad says cooking them
over a fire is too much work...</i>

525
00:53:32,312 --> 00:53:33,581
<i>but I like it.</i>

526
00:54:01,475 --> 00:54:03,044
Yes.

527
00:54:03,077 --> 00:54:04,846
Yes.

528
00:54:04,879 --> 00:54:06,379
Oh!

529
00:54:06,413 --> 00:54:09,416
Tsk, you make it all
look so easy.

530
00:54:11,886 --> 00:54:13,621
What do you mean?

531
00:54:13,654 --> 00:54:15,923
Well, just...

532
00:54:15,957 --> 00:54:17,925
existing here.

533
00:54:17,959 --> 00:54:21,662
There's a balance,
a beauty to it.

534
00:54:21,696 --> 00:54:23,798
I've been at it
for some time now,

535
00:54:23,831 --> 00:54:27,568
and I think
that you would do better

536
00:54:27,602 --> 00:54:30,905
with your hands tied
behind your back.

537
00:54:30,938 --> 00:54:32,707
It's all I know.

538
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:33,875
Hmm.

539
00:54:35,076 --> 00:54:36,911
What else do you wanna know?

540
00:54:38,946 --> 00:54:41,414
Stuff nobody can answer.

541
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:44,384
Yeah? Like what?

542
00:54:44,417 --> 00:54:45,853
Like...

543
00:54:47,655 --> 00:54:49,657
where do we go when we die?

544
00:54:52,627 --> 00:54:54,061
What do you think?

545
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:59,534
Well, Dad says we go
in the dirt and stay there.

546
00:54:59,567 --> 00:55:02,069
The Swiss Family Robinson
believe in Jesus.

547
00:55:04,105 --> 00:55:05,840
And what do you think?

548
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:11,444
Well, I think we go in the dirt
and get eaten up by the plants.

549
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:13,047
Like the big trees.

550
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,850
And the yellow cedar
that I shaved today.

551
00:55:15,883 --> 00:55:18,719
Then we can go lots of places.

552
00:55:18,753 --> 00:55:21,823
We could grow into leaves
atop the forest one day

553
00:55:21,856 --> 00:55:24,826
to fall back down to the earth
and do it all over again.

554
00:55:26,426 --> 00:55:28,095
Or maybe a berry

555
00:55:28,129 --> 00:55:29,664
that a bird eats

556
00:55:29,697 --> 00:55:32,533
and takes us on ride
far away from here.

557
00:55:34,035 --> 00:55:35,937
A constant circle of life.

558
00:55:39,874 --> 00:55:42,577
Is that where you think
your mom is?

559
00:55:47,414 --> 00:55:49,416
She's the very top

560
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:52,653
of the tallest golden spruce
in the entire forest.

561
00:55:54,088 --> 00:55:55,957
A tree so beautiful,
when you see it,

562
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:58,559
it freezes you
right where you stand.

563
00:56:03,965 --> 00:56:05,633
Thank you, Jake.

564
00:56:09,203 --> 00:56:10,538
For what?

565
00:56:12,506 --> 00:56:14,075
Just for being you.

566
00:57:58,713 --> 00:58:01,215
I want you to come home with me.

567
00:58:01,248 --> 00:58:02,984
I think you'll love it.

568
00:58:07,054 --> 00:58:09,724
What would that
look like, Jake?

569
00:58:11,058 --> 00:58:13,127
Like an old oil painting.

570
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:19,867
Like a family
living in harmony with nature.

571
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:23,904
Giving back more than we take.

572
00:58:25,806 --> 00:58:28,242
Growing slowly
with the tallest trees.

573
00:58:29,877 --> 00:58:31,645
Like a heaven.

574
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:34,048
But a real one.

575
00:58:34,081 --> 00:58:35,282
Right here.

576
00:58:43,691 --> 00:58:45,059
Jake...

577
00:58:45,092 --> 00:58:47,028
I'm old enough to know better,

578
00:58:47,061 --> 00:58:49,730
so I'm just gonna say this.

579
00:58:49,764 --> 00:58:51,932
What happened last night...

580
00:58:53,934 --> 00:58:55,970
was pretty amazing.

581
00:58:58,939 --> 00:59:01,142
But I don't wanna rush things.

582
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:04,945
I don't think that's good
for either of us.

583
00:59:06,814 --> 00:59:09,150
You don't wanna be with me?

584
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:11,185
No.

585
00:59:11,218 --> 00:59:13,120
I don't know. I mean...

586
00:59:13,154 --> 00:59:15,056
We just met.

587
00:59:15,089 --> 00:59:17,858
And I am not
in a position in my life

588
00:59:17,892 --> 00:59:20,861
to be making big decisions
like that.

589
00:59:23,064 --> 00:59:26,033
I have some stuff
I need to deal with today,

590
00:59:26,067 --> 00:59:29,870
and I don't think you should
stay here. I'm sorry.

591
00:59:29,904 --> 00:59:31,772
I can help you.

592
00:59:33,407 --> 00:59:34,942
It's personal.

593
00:59:36,811 --> 00:59:39,013
I'll see you soon though,
okay? I promise.

594
00:59:39,046 --> 00:59:40,915
- When?
- I don't know.

595
00:59:40,948 --> 00:59:42,917
Maybe in a few days.

596
00:59:56,664 --> 00:59:57,965
Do you know where they live?

597
00:59:57,998 --> 01:00:00,167
Jake, he just stops by
from time to time.

598
01:00:00,201 --> 01:00:03,003
Stops by?
Ma'am, are you in danger?

599
01:00:03,037 --> 01:00:04,805
What did you find out?

600
01:00:04,839 --> 01:00:08,175
Do any of these places or dates
mean anything to you?

601
01:00:10,211 --> 01:00:11,378
No.

602
01:00:11,412 --> 01:00:13,013
How old is Jake?

603
01:00:13,047 --> 01:00:16,383
- I'd say... 25?
- Hmm.

604
01:00:18,152 --> 01:00:21,822
On December 11th, 2002,
in Chicago,

605
01:00:21,856 --> 01:00:23,290
Troy Belstair kidnaps his son

606
01:00:23,324 --> 01:00:25,926
and attempts murder
on Miss Chandrey.

607
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,295
House burns down
and arson is suspected.

608
01:00:28,329 --> 01:00:30,998
- What are the chances?
- The only thing we have on him

609
01:00:31,031 --> 01:00:33,200
is his Illinois
state driver's license.

610
01:00:33,234 --> 01:00:35,369
Well, I've never seen
Jake's dad.

611
01:00:35,402 --> 01:00:37,238
Does it look like him?

612
01:00:40,875 --> 01:00:42,676
I don't know.

613
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:44,211
You sure?

614
01:01:18,112 --> 01:01:20,080
So this is home, huh?

615
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,888
Town?

616
01:01:27,922 --> 01:01:29,156
That's rich.

617
01:01:30,891 --> 01:01:32,359
Two plane rides to a ferry,

618
01:01:32,393 --> 01:01:35,362
then to another plane
that almost killed me...

619
01:01:35,396 --> 01:01:37,431
to a skiff.

620
01:01:37,464 --> 01:01:40,401
I think it's pretty safe to say
this is not a town.

621
01:01:41,536 --> 01:01:43,837
How are they?

622
01:01:43,871 --> 01:01:45,072
They're good.

623
01:01:45,105 --> 01:01:46,941
They're where they want to be,
home.

624
01:01:46,974 --> 01:01:49,076
Don't be an ass, Andy.

625
01:01:49,109 --> 01:01:52,012
I'm not. I'm just being real.

626
01:01:54,348 --> 01:01:55,482
Thank you.

627
01:01:58,986 --> 01:02:00,354
How you doing?

628
01:02:02,823 --> 01:02:04,425
Okay.

629
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:06,160
It's been pretty rough,

630
01:02:06,193 --> 01:02:09,330
but I think I'm starting to find
what I was looking for.

631
01:02:09,363 --> 01:02:11,065
Mm.

632
01:02:11,098 --> 01:02:15,102
And what exactly
was that again?

633
01:02:15,135 --> 01:02:17,104
Just to be clear.

634
01:02:18,439 --> 01:02:20,874
Balance.

635
01:02:20,908 --> 01:02:22,510
- In nature.
- Mm-hmm.

636
01:02:23,811 --> 01:02:26,380
That's it? Nature.

637
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:28,882
You still don't get it,
like, even a little bit?

638
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:30,784
No, I guess I don't.

639
01:02:33,187 --> 01:02:35,523
We met when we were so young.

640
01:02:35,557 --> 01:02:39,260
I don't think we even knew
who we were then.

641
01:02:39,293 --> 01:02:42,496
And I never wanted
to live in the city.

642
01:02:44,465 --> 01:02:47,201
Maybe I wasn't ready
for the responsibility of kids.

643
01:02:47,234 --> 01:02:51,238
But then we did, and your job,

644
01:02:51,272 --> 01:02:54,275
and it was like we were stuck.

645
01:02:54,308 --> 01:02:57,579
Every day
worse than the last.

646
01:02:57,612 --> 01:02:59,847
And the city and the people,

647
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,016
it was like it was
eating me alive.

648
01:03:02,049 --> 01:03:04,251
I honestly think

649
01:03:04,285 --> 01:03:07,321
it poisons the purity people
are supposed to have,

650
01:03:07,354 --> 01:03:11,292
in balance, where things matter
more than just money.

651
01:03:11,325 --> 01:03:12,459
Hmm.

652
01:03:14,161 --> 01:03:16,531
You know what I think?

653
01:03:16,564 --> 01:03:19,567
I think you're going through
an early midlife crisis

654
01:03:19,601 --> 01:03:22,136
and you don't know
what you need right now.

655
01:03:22,169 --> 01:03:24,138
You could've got another job.

656
01:03:24,171 --> 01:03:26,940
You could've gotten out
of the house once in a while.

657
01:03:26,974 --> 01:03:29,943
But instead you're what?

658
01:03:29,977 --> 01:03:31,546
You're here.

659
01:03:31,579 --> 01:03:35,349
It was like
I was just waiting to die.

660
01:03:35,382 --> 01:03:38,319
I tried to tell you
and the kids

661
01:03:38,352 --> 01:03:42,022
what I needed,
only to land on deaf ears.

662
01:03:42,056 --> 01:03:44,458
I was ignored.

663
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:46,193
And hated.

664
01:03:46,226 --> 01:03:49,330
Like... Like it was some kind
of unattainable reality.

665
01:03:49,363 --> 01:03:50,998
Look at you.

666
01:03:51,031 --> 01:03:53,434
You're up here
hiding from the real world.

667
01:03:53,467 --> 01:03:55,069
I'm not hiding.

668
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:59,574
I can't go back to who I was.

669
01:05:03,437 --> 01:05:06,473
The kids like
living in the city, Hen,

670
01:05:06,508 --> 01:05:09,511
with their friends and school...

671
01:05:09,544 --> 01:05:12,146
Because they don't know
anything else.

672
01:05:20,053 --> 01:05:22,156
I think I should have
full custody of the kids.

673
01:05:22,189 --> 01:05:23,490
What?

674
01:05:23,525 --> 01:05:25,058
You chose to come up here

675
01:05:25,092 --> 01:05:27,161
without them, without us.

676
01:05:27,194 --> 01:05:31,131
Over and over,
I begged you and them

677
01:05:31,165 --> 01:05:33,033
to come with me.

678
01:05:33,066 --> 01:05:36,403
All it did was alienate me
from my own family.

679
01:05:36,437 --> 01:05:39,541
What was I supposed to do?

680
01:05:52,219 --> 01:05:56,256
Hen, you're the only person
that wanted this.

681
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:59,527
- Just you.
- I can't not see my kids, Andy.

682
01:05:59,561 --> 01:06:03,030
Did you ever think
maybe they don't wanna see you?

683
01:06:03,063 --> 01:06:05,265
All you do is hurt them...

684
01:06:05,299 --> 01:06:06,601
and yourself.

685
01:06:08,135 --> 01:06:10,037
And let's be honest,

686
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:13,173
they're not gonna make this trip
up to this shithole to visit...

687
01:06:13,207 --> 01:06:14,542
Fuck you, Andy!

688
01:06:14,576 --> 01:06:17,512
Go back
to your suburban pacifier.

689
01:06:17,545 --> 01:06:19,379
I'm gonna get a lawyer
to fix this.

690
01:06:19,413 --> 01:06:22,015
- I'll get a lawyer to fix this.
- Good luck.

691
01:06:22,049 --> 01:06:24,117
Don't forget,
you wanted this. Not me.

692
01:06:24,151 --> 01:06:26,654
- Not like this. It's not fair.
- No. What's not fair is bailing

693
01:06:26,688 --> 01:06:29,791
and thinking you have the same
rights as a responsible parent.

694
01:06:29,824 --> 01:06:31,559
- Oh!
- Fuck!

695
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:35,496
What the fuck are you doing?

696
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:37,197
Who the fuck are you?

697
01:06:37,231 --> 01:06:39,399
Oh, wow. He even legal?

698
01:06:39,433 --> 01:06:41,603
It's not... It's not
what it looks like, Andy.

699
01:06:41,636 --> 01:06:44,137
Wait till the kids find out
Mom's banging a boy.

700
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:46,508
Good luck finding a lawyer
in butt-fuck nowhere.

701
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:49,409
Leave me alone!
Why are you following me?

702
01:06:49,443 --> 01:06:51,478
What the fuck do you want?

703
01:06:51,513 --> 01:06:53,146
- Who was that man?
- My husband.

704
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:55,382
It's none
of your goddamn business.

705
01:06:55,415 --> 01:06:57,217
You have a husband?

706
01:06:57,251 --> 01:06:59,787
- What do you mean?
- Get the fuck away from my truck!

707
01:07:11,799 --> 01:07:14,268
I don't know
how to get home from here.

708
01:07:15,335 --> 01:07:17,404
Jesus H. Christ.

709
01:07:33,487 --> 01:07:35,389
Jake, you need
to go home right now.

710
01:07:35,422 --> 01:07:38,225
- Who are you?
- You need to leave.

711
01:07:38,258 --> 01:07:39,727
How could you do this to me?

712
01:07:41,663 --> 01:07:44,566
Yes, Jake,
I have an ex-husband.

713
01:07:44,599 --> 01:07:47,167
And I have two kids. You don't
know anything about it.

714
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,836
You don't need to know
anything about it.

715
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:51,271
And you don't get to judge me.

716
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:56,243
I betrayed my father,
and for what?

717
01:07:56,276 --> 01:07:58,278
People did awful things
during the wars,

718
01:07:58,312 --> 01:08:02,717
but I would never, ever leave
my family or betray my wife.

719
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,686
What wars?

720
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:07,722
World War III.
Man's last mistake.

721
01:08:07,755 --> 01:08:09,189
World War III?

722
01:08:09,222 --> 01:08:10,758
December 11th, 2002.

723
01:08:13,226 --> 01:08:14,461
December...

724
01:08:18,231 --> 01:08:19,801
December...

725
01:08:19,834 --> 01:08:22,502
Oh, God. I know this date.

726
01:08:22,537 --> 01:08:24,572
Yeah. It rewrote history.

727
01:08:26,674 --> 01:08:27,809
No.

728
01:08:29,309 --> 01:08:31,345
There was no World War III.

729
01:08:36,283 --> 01:08:39,921
What happened to your mother
and you that day was awful,

730
01:08:39,954 --> 01:08:41,856
but there was no world war.

731
01:08:41,889 --> 01:08:45,425
What are you talking about?
Why are you lying?

732
01:08:47,194 --> 01:08:48,362
Jake.

733
01:08:48,395 --> 01:08:51,431
I'm so sorry, Jake.

734
01:08:51,465 --> 01:08:53,801
I have no idea
what kind of fucked-up shit

735
01:08:53,835 --> 01:08:57,538
your father has been telling you
all cooped up out in the woods,

736
01:08:57,572 --> 01:09:01,274
but there was no World War III.

737
01:09:01,308 --> 01:09:03,811
He kidnapped you, and he tried
to kill your mother.

738
01:09:03,845 --> 01:09:06,614
- Stop lying to me!
- Okay. I can't do this.

739
01:09:06,648 --> 01:09:08,850
I have my own shit to deal with.

740
01:09:28,603 --> 01:09:30,470
Where did you get this?

741
01:09:35,475 --> 01:09:37,344
Do you know where that man is?

742
01:09:39,914 --> 01:09:41,248
What is this?

743
01:09:42,482 --> 01:09:45,419
I need to know who this man is!

744
01:09:45,452 --> 01:09:47,622
Don't come here again.

745
01:10:19,754 --> 01:10:21,723
You decided to come back.

746
01:10:24,592 --> 01:10:25,927
I want the truth.

747
01:10:27,929 --> 01:10:29,964
- About what?
- About everything.

748
01:10:31,766 --> 01:10:33,835
I have never lied to you
about anything.

749
01:10:35,536 --> 01:10:37,004
What about the wars?

750
01:10:38,673 --> 01:10:41,308
There were no marauders,

751
01:10:41,341 --> 01:10:42,510
gangs of limbless men,

752
01:10:42,543 --> 01:10:44,645
psychos trying
to kill each other.

753
01:10:44,679 --> 01:10:46,313
You need to go further, Jake.

754
01:10:46,346 --> 01:10:49,751
Then you will see
the fucked-up, damaged world.

755
01:10:51,753 --> 01:10:53,755
Did World War III happen?

756
01:10:57,992 --> 01:10:59,527
Did the wars happen?

757
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,596
- Yes.
- Lying.

758
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:05,398
December 11th, 2002.

759
01:11:05,432 --> 01:11:08,035
The day humanity died.
Shit hit the fan.

760
01:11:09,369 --> 01:11:10,938
So there was no real war?

761
01:11:10,972 --> 01:11:13,641
A conventional war, no,
but a war nonetheless.

762
01:11:13,674 --> 01:11:15,510
We barely escaped.

763
01:11:23,518 --> 01:11:24,852
Why did we kill this man?

764
01:11:24,886 --> 01:11:28,623
Why do we kill any men?
It's us or them.

765
01:11:28,656 --> 01:11:33,561
There's a family looking
for this man. A little girl.

766
01:11:33,594 --> 01:11:36,631
Dad, why did we kill him?

767
01:11:36,664 --> 01:11:38,699
He was gonna kill us, Jake.

768
01:11:38,733 --> 01:11:41,334
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

769
01:11:41,368 --> 01:11:44,806
Dad, that man said
something to me before he died.

770
01:11:44,839 --> 01:11:47,809
He was dying and he knew it,
and all he said to me was:

771
01:11:47,842 --> 01:11:50,678
"Tell my daughter
that I love her."

772
01:11:51,846 --> 01:11:54,816
You are out of your depths, son.

773
01:11:56,383 --> 01:11:59,587
The human species
has gone AWOL.

774
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:02,089
They don't know what's
right or wrong any longer.

775
01:12:05,059 --> 01:12:06,694
What happened to her?

776
01:12:08,729 --> 01:12:09,997
I don't wanna talk about it.

777
01:12:10,031 --> 01:12:12,767
I wanna know
what this lying whore

778
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,702
has been filling your head with.

779
01:12:14,735 --> 01:12:16,503
Nothing. She's not...

780
01:12:18,405 --> 01:12:20,107
I just want the truth, Dad.

781
01:12:21,742 --> 01:12:23,544
You want the truth?

782
01:12:23,578 --> 01:12:24,745
I wanna know who she is.

783
01:12:24,779 --> 01:12:26,614
- Who is she?
- It doesn't matter.

784
01:12:26,647 --> 01:12:29,083
Is she the woman
that you said you'd killed?

785
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,522
Did you fuck her?

786
01:12:34,555 --> 01:12:35,957
Yes, Dad.

787
01:12:38,059 --> 01:12:40,528
And I bet in that moment,
you felt better

788
01:12:40,561 --> 01:12:42,864
than you ever had
in the whole world.

789
01:12:45,066 --> 01:12:48,002
And then she fucked you over,
didn't she?

790
01:12:51,005 --> 01:12:52,740
She lied to me.

791
01:12:55,009 --> 01:12:56,577
She has a family.

792
01:12:57,778 --> 01:12:59,881
She abandoned her family.

793
01:13:04,085 --> 01:13:06,787
I know how much
that can hurt, son.

794
01:13:08,022 --> 01:13:11,058
You have fallen prey
to the world.

795
01:13:11,092 --> 01:13:13,628
Like I always said
you would.

796
01:13:15,563 --> 01:13:17,632
People seem good...

797
01:13:18,766 --> 01:13:20,101
but they are not.

798
01:13:21,836 --> 01:13:24,105
I tried to protect you
from all this.

799
01:13:24,138 --> 01:13:26,974
It really felt
like I could trust her.

800
01:13:27,008 --> 01:13:30,778
It's okay, son. Sometimes
we have to learn the hard way.

801
01:13:32,546 --> 01:13:34,782
They're all liars.

802
01:13:34,815 --> 01:13:37,084
I have told you this
so many times.

803
01:13:39,887 --> 01:13:41,055
I know.

804
01:13:41,088 --> 01:13:43,057
Then why don't you believe me?

805
01:13:44,992 --> 01:13:46,493
I don't know.

806
01:13:46,527 --> 01:13:48,162
Do you not trust me?

807
01:13:54,068 --> 01:13:56,971
Do you believe there are
good people out there, Dad?

808
01:13:58,973 --> 01:14:02,610
They're all filthy,
lying, greedy cheaters.

809
01:14:04,245 --> 01:14:06,814
It takes time for some of them
to reveal their true colors,

810
01:14:06,847 --> 01:14:08,716
but can't trust a one of them.

811
01:14:08,749 --> 01:14:10,483
How do you know for sure?

812
01:14:10,518 --> 01:14:14,155
With age and wisdom,
you earn the power of judgment.

813
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,962
Did she give this to you?

814
01:14:24,298 --> 01:14:25,866
She found it.

815
01:14:27,601 --> 01:14:29,670
Does she know you know him?

816
01:14:40,915 --> 01:14:42,850
She needs to die, Jake.

817
01:14:46,153 --> 01:14:48,255
Does she have to?

818
01:14:48,289 --> 01:14:51,192
Do you want them to take
all of this away from us?

819
01:14:51,225 --> 01:14:53,060
To take us away
from each another?

820
01:14:53,094 --> 01:14:55,696
Why would they take us away
from each other?

821
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:58,265
To protect us from them.

822
01:14:58,299 --> 01:15:02,303
I've had to do things
that they deem wrong

823
01:15:02,336 --> 01:15:04,672
but I know are right.

824
01:15:06,607 --> 01:15:08,009
You see?

825
01:15:10,778 --> 01:15:13,147
I gotta go finish
breaking that deer down.

826
01:15:14,682 --> 01:15:16,617
You pack our bags.

827
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:19,020
We leave before nightfall.

828
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:30,965
Yes, sir.

829
01:16:17,411 --> 01:16:19,747
What are you doing?

830
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:21,248
We can't kill her, Dad.

831
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:24,718
She's probably just like us.

832
01:16:24,752 --> 01:16:26,153
She's made mistakes,
just like us.

833
01:16:26,187 --> 01:16:28,255
But you don't kill someone
for that.

834
01:16:28,289 --> 01:16:30,825
You can't be certain
of that, Jake.

835
01:16:32,726 --> 01:16:35,329
But what I can be certain of

836
01:16:35,362 --> 01:16:39,233
is once she is dead, she will
no longer be a danger to us.

837
01:16:40,801 --> 01:16:42,937
I'm not certain.

838
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:46,073
But I am willing to bet my life
in place of hers.

839
01:16:47,942 --> 01:16:49,343
You really mean that?

840
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,850
Well, for both our sakes,
I hope you're not wrong.

841
01:16:56,951 --> 01:16:59,353
Dad, let me go to her.

842
01:16:59,386 --> 01:17:01,722
I can trick her,

843
01:17:01,755 --> 01:17:03,324
make her feel safe and warm,

844
01:17:03,357 --> 01:17:06,827
and she will never be
a problem for us ever again.

845
01:17:13,033 --> 01:17:15,002
I'm trusting you with this.

846
01:17:23,944 --> 01:17:25,279
I wanna show you something

847
01:17:25,312 --> 01:17:27,414
I should've shown you
a long time ago.

848
01:17:28,816 --> 01:17:30,117
Come on.

849
01:17:40,427 --> 01:17:41,962
Go on.

850
01:17:43,464 --> 01:17:44,965
All the way in there.

851
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,269
All the way to the back.

852
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:51,705
Sometimes the things we do
in life

853
01:17:51,739 --> 01:17:54,475
don't make sense straightaway,

854
01:17:54,509 --> 01:17:56,277
but in time they do.

855
01:18:01,382 --> 01:18:03,117
I'm sorry, Jake.

856
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:05,953
But you don't understand
what is going on here.

857
01:18:05,986 --> 01:18:09,023
That woman is a poison
in our world.

858
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:14,995
Let me out!

859
01:18:15,029 --> 01:18:17,932
You shouldn't have lied
about killing her!

860
01:18:17,965 --> 01:18:19,166
Dad! Dad, listen to me.

861
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,935
I promise
she's not gonna hurt us.

862
01:18:20,968 --> 01:18:23,971
You may be willing to risk
your life for her, but I am not!

863
01:18:24,004 --> 01:18:26,307
I know what women
like that can do!

864
01:18:29,076 --> 01:18:32,379
Dad. Dad, Dad. Listen to me.
Listen to me.

865
01:18:32,413 --> 01:18:35,482
She's not gonna hurt us,
I promise you.

866
01:18:35,517 --> 01:18:37,151
She's not gonna hurt us.

867
01:18:38,219 --> 01:18:39,920
I'm going now.

868
01:18:43,023 --> 01:18:45,025
I'm gonna clean up your mess.

869
01:18:45,059 --> 01:18:46,393
You fucking liar!

870
01:18:52,866 --> 01:18:54,335
You said you never
met the father.

871
01:18:54,368 --> 01:18:56,136
- I haven't.
- The son never mentioned anything

872
01:18:56,170 --> 01:18:57,838
- about the missing hunter?
- Um...

873
01:18:57,871 --> 01:19:00,007
- So it could be Jake.
- No.

874
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:02,009
No? You said he attacked
your husband?

875
01:19:02,042 --> 01:19:05,412
- He... It was a misunderstanding.
- A violent misunderstanding.

876
01:19:05,446 --> 01:19:07,481
Jake is not a killer.

877
01:19:07,515 --> 01:19:09,016
So after the flyer business,

878
01:19:09,049 --> 01:19:12,086
he just disappeared
into the woods, roughly?

879
01:19:12,119 --> 01:19:16,290
He was really upset
and he went into the woods, yes.

880
01:19:16,323 --> 01:19:18,425
Me and one of the boys will
escort you back for safety.

881
01:19:18,459 --> 01:19:21,362
There's only one other trooper
and he's four hours behind us.

882
01:19:21,395 --> 01:19:23,464
Oh, no, no, no.
That's... I'm fine.

883
01:19:23,497 --> 01:19:25,533
I'm fine. Thank you, though.

884
01:20:01,569 --> 01:20:04,171
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

885
01:20:04,204 --> 01:20:06,006
Let him go. Let him go.

886
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,441
Don't look at him.
Leave him alone.

887
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:09,310
You fucking leave him alone!
Troy...

888
01:20:09,343 --> 01:20:10,978
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

889
01:20:52,186 --> 01:20:53,521
Henrietta?

890
01:21:07,535 --> 01:21:10,504
- We just wanna have a look-see.
- Is that really necessary?

891
01:21:11,639 --> 01:21:13,140
Stop!

892
01:21:13,173 --> 01:21:15,275
Jake! No, they're cops!

893
01:21:15,309 --> 01:21:17,579
Put the gun down.
They're here to help us.

894
01:21:20,981 --> 01:21:23,618
Put the gun on the ground
and drop to your knees!

895
01:21:23,651 --> 01:21:25,452
No, no, no. He's fine.

896
01:21:25,486 --> 01:21:28,556
It's okay.
He didn't know. He doesn't know.

897
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:31,225
Henrietta, you need
to move to the side.

898
01:21:31,258 --> 01:21:34,361
He doesn't...
He didn't mean any harm. I promise.

899
01:21:34,395 --> 01:21:36,664
Put the gun on the ground.

900
01:21:41,569 --> 01:21:42,903
Hey!

901
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:46,608
Stay with me.

902
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:50,377
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not fucking okay!

903
01:21:50,411 --> 01:21:52,179
- What the fuck is happening?
- I'm sorry.

904
01:21:52,212 --> 01:21:55,249
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. It's not your fault.

905
01:21:55,282 --> 01:21:58,419
It's my father.
He's coming to kill you.

906
01:21:59,754 --> 01:22:01,088
Oh, my God.

907
01:22:03,457 --> 01:22:05,325
We need to get you
somewhere safe.

908
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:08,095
No, I have an idea. The preps.

909
01:22:10,698 --> 01:22:12,734
Okay. I gotta go now.

910
01:22:12,767 --> 01:22:16,571
Remember, do not backtrack.
He'll be following my tracks.

911
01:22:16,604 --> 01:22:18,205
Okay. Go.

912
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:17,498
Dad!

913
01:23:20,234 --> 01:23:21,636
I know you're here!

914
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:25,105
Where is she?

915
01:23:25,138 --> 01:23:27,407
No.

916
01:23:27,441 --> 01:23:31,245
- This has to happen, Jake.
- No, it doesn't.

917
01:23:31,278 --> 01:23:33,515
She's a good person.

918
01:23:33,548 --> 01:23:36,483
She shouldn't fucking die
because you're not.

919
01:23:46,528 --> 01:23:48,530
One day you'll understand.

920
01:24:05,345 --> 01:24:08,650
Okay. Please, help, please!
Please help.

921
01:24:19,192 --> 01:24:20,460
Fuck!

922
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:33,440
Fuck!

923
01:24:43,685 --> 01:24:45,887
You should never
have left your family

924
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,689
and started fucking with mine.

925
01:25:14,214 --> 01:25:15,717
You women,

926
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:19,520
you think you can
just fuck up a man's life

927
01:25:19,554 --> 01:25:22,255
and there'd be no consequences!

928
01:25:22,289 --> 01:25:23,758
Well, I got news for you.

929
01:25:24,959 --> 01:25:26,561
Not me!

930
01:25:29,897 --> 01:25:35,369
You children can continue
to fuck up the world...

931
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:52,486
but you are not
corrupting my son.

932
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:04,565
It is snakes like you
that are ruining humanity.

933
01:26:08,435 --> 01:26:10,370
Poisoning my son...

934
01:26:15,342 --> 01:26:17,812
will be the last mistake...

935
01:26:17,845 --> 01:26:19,580
you make.

936
01:28:53,568 --> 01:28:54,836
Here.

937
01:29:05,012 --> 01:29:06,714
I love you, boy.

938
01:29:13,821 --> 01:29:15,756
It was all for love.

939
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:20,895
Now...

940
01:29:34,508 --> 01:29:35,743
go on.

941
01:29:36,811 --> 01:29:38,179
No.

942
01:29:38,212 --> 01:29:40,882
- No, Dad.
- Go on.

943
01:29:40,915 --> 01:29:42,049
Hey...

944
01:29:45,219 --> 01:29:47,154
this is not a democracy.

945
01:31:18,112 --> 01:31:21,649
<i>I didn't realize
it right then and there,</i>

946
01:31:21,682 --> 01:31:24,652
<i>but my faith in humanity</i>

947
01:31:24,685 --> 01:31:27,021
<i>was pretty close
to your father's.</i>

948
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:34,195
<i>Truly, I fear that I could've
ended up just like him,</i>

949
01:31:34,228 --> 01:31:37,698
<i>isolated and bitter
at the world.</i>

950
01:31:39,567 --> 01:31:43,771
<i>It took him almost killing us
for me to realize</i>

951
01:31:43,804 --> 01:31:46,741
<i>just how far
I had let myself go.</i>

952
01:31:50,011 --> 01:31:52,046
<i>And while
I still struggle at times</i>

953
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:54,648
<i>with the world
we live in today,</i>

954
01:31:54,682 --> 01:31:58,185
<i>you gave me something back
I was missing:</i>

955
01:31:58,219 --> 01:32:02,790
<i>The belief there is
still good in the world.</i>

956
01:32:07,695 --> 01:32:10,064
<i>I thank you for that, Jake.</i>

957
01:32:10,097 --> 01:32:13,167
<i>It's the greatest gift
a person could give.</i>

958
01:32:23,277 --> 01:32:24,779
Mom?

959
01:32:26,714 --> 01:32:28,049
You ready?

960
01:32:48,269 --> 01:32:50,738
<i>I didn't know about this one.</i>

961
01:32:53,007 --> 01:32:54,775
<i>It's outside the perimeter.</i>

962
01:32:56,310 --> 01:32:58,279
<i>Dad called this area
No Man's Land.</i>

963
01:33:13,761 --> 01:33:16,363
<i>I don't know how I feel
about luck these days.</i>

964
01:33:19,033 --> 01:33:20,835
<i>I know I'm prepared
for the worst</i>

965
01:33:20,868 --> 01:33:23,037
<i>if that should ever
actually happen.</i>

966
01:33:27,274 --> 01:33:28,609
<i>But really...</i>

967
01:33:30,744 --> 01:33:32,213
<i>I'm just hopeful.</i>

968
01:33:35,749 --> 01:33:37,384
<i>Hopeful for my future.</i>

969
01:33:40,788 --> 01:33:42,790
<i>Hopeful for this world.</i>

970
01:33:55,436 --> 01:33:57,037
