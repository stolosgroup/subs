WELCOME TO PICO MUNDO

4
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,244
My name is Odd Thomas.

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,029
Though in this age when fame is the
altar at which most people worship.

6
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,537
I'm not sure why you should care.

7
00:00:32,572 --> 00:00:34,988
I'm not a celebrity.
I'm not the child of a celebrity.

8
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:36,777
I've never been married to,
abused by,

9
00:00:36,812 --> 00:00:38,530
or provided a kidney to a celebrity.

10
00:00:38,565 --> 00:00:39,858
Green Moon Bowling

11
00:00:42,572 --> 00:00:46,020
But I do lead an unusual life.

12
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:55,605
Penny Kalisto.

13
00:01:05,615 --> 00:01:08,080
My name really is Odd.

14
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:11,488
According to my mother, it was
a screw-up on my birth certificate.

15
00:01:11,523 --> 00:01:14,861
She says I was supposed to be called
Todd, after a Lithuanian uncle.

16
00:01:15,282 --> 00:01:17,539
My father insists my name
was always Odd...

17
00:01:17,574 --> 00:01:20,821
and he notes that all of
my uncles are Bulgarian.

18
00:01:21,324 --> 00:01:24,091
My father claims
my mother is insane.

19
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,860
My mother, of course,
begs to differ.

20
00:01:27,575 --> 00:01:32,777
My abilities are a gift from God!

21
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:35,489
My father won that argument.

22
00:01:36,742 --> 00:01:40,403
I was 12 years old when they finally
locked her up and threw away the key.

23
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:49,569
I've come to believe that
my mother and I share certain...

24
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:51,082
abilities.

25
00:01:51,117 --> 00:01:53,826
Since I don't want to be locked up
with the key thrown away...

26
00:01:53,861 --> 00:01:57,985
I've pretty much kept mine a secret.

27
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:07,368
Odd Thomas.

28
00:02:07,403 --> 00:02:08,792
Hello, Harlo.

29
00:02:08,827 --> 00:02:10,375
Long time, no see.

30
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,327
Whoa! Whoa! Hey, hey.
Come on, man. No touchy, no feely.

31
00:02:13,362 --> 00:02:16,401
- Sorry, but I love this car.
- I know.

32
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,440
It's too bad a car
can't love you back.

33
00:02:22,077 --> 00:02:24,304
What's wrong, Odd?
There anything I can do?

34
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:26,531
No, it's something
you've already done.

35
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:29,509
Hey! Hey! Come on- oh, Odd.
No fooling around, man.

36
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:31,650
- Give me my keys.
- Her blood is in your pocket.

37
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,866
Most people would think
that's a weird thing to say...

38
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:38,113
but you don't think
it's very weird, do you, Harlo?

39
00:02:44,995 --> 00:02:46,239
On that night...

40
00:02:47,704 --> 00:02:50,204
you took a piece of white felt...

41
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,127
and after killing Penny...

42
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:54,870
you collected some of her blood.

43
00:02:54,905 --> 00:02:56,919
And now it's dry...

44
00:02:56,954 --> 00:03:00,700
and stiff and
brittle like a cracker...

45
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:05,283
and it's still in your pocket.

46
00:03:12,996 --> 00:03:15,705
In moments like these,
pity tears at me.

47
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,379
And a kind of madness
comes over me...

48
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:21,122
forcing me to hunt people
like Harlo Landerson...

49
00:03:21,157 --> 00:03:25,068
who I have no pity for whatsoever.

50
00:03:42,373 --> 00:03:44,448
Sorry, Mrs. Curtees!

51
00:03:46,332 --> 00:03:47,908
Sorry, Saleen!

52
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,000
What the hell are you doing?

53
00:04:23,035 --> 00:04:25,205
Mom, what's going on?

54
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:31,331
Stevie, run honey, run!

55
00:04:39,876 --> 00:04:40,906
Come here!

56
00:04:49,793 --> 00:04:52,496
My life is filled with guys
like Harlo Landerson.

57
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:58,122
And since I like my face
just the way it is...

58
00:04:59,378 --> 00:05:01,036
I learned how to handle myself.

59
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:22,287
I may see dead people, but then,
by God, I do something about it.

60
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:24,969
Hey. Hey!

61
00:05:25,004 --> 00:05:26,927
Shift down, man! Go easy.

62
00:05:26,962 --> 00:05:29,877
I'm sorry, sir,
but I don't have a "go easy" gear.

63
00:05:31,046 --> 00:05:32,796
You should probably get that looked at.

64
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:34,345
Now, Officer Eckles...

65
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,470
does being a police officer

66
00:05:35,505 --> 00:05:37,171
give you the right to beat
the shit out of people?

67
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:38,803
Not at all, Officer Varner.

68
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,828
But it is one of
the perks of the job.

69
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,039
I believe in a higher power
and the afterlife.

70
00:05:52,713 --> 00:05:54,586
Call me strange.

71
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:56,845
Others do.

72
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,752
He's so strange.

73
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:02,471
Don't worry, Penny.

74
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:05,922
I think where you're going
is a home for the spirit...

75
00:06:05,957 --> 00:06:09,585
and it's filled with
kindness and wonder.

76
00:06:10,714 --> 00:06:12,587
I'm sorry, Penny.

77
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:15,702
I'm sorry your life was so short.

78
00:06:26,257 --> 00:06:27,915
The dead don't talk.

79
00:06:28,757 --> 00:06:30,831
I don't know why.

80
00:06:35,425 --> 00:06:36,722
Here we are again.

81
00:06:36,757 --> 00:06:40,005
Busted furniture and
shattered glass everywhere.

82
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:44,015
Most of it was not my fault.

83
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,446
Except the panda bear lamp
and the Biffy the Clown mirror.

84
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:50,806
- That was this guy.
- Why didn't you come to me first..

85
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:54,675
give me a chance to find a way
to get Harlo to entrap himself?

86
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,807
Whenever we do it that way,

87
00:06:55,842 --> 00:06:57,967
it's always more efficient
and less destructive.

88
00:06:58,002 --> 00:07:00,092
Yes, I know but he had
to be stopped right now...

89
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:02,297
or he was gonna do it again soon.

90
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,510
That's what Penny wanted to tell me.
That's why she hadn't left yet.

91
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:08,957
Son, you so complicate my life.

92
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,003
Look.

93
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:15,891
Besides her blood...

94
00:07:15,926 --> 00:07:19,885
Harlo had these photos of Penny
post-mortem in his wallet.

95
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,673
If there's any fuss about
how you pegged Harlo...

96
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,427
just say he opened up
his wallet to pay off a bet.

97
00:07:25,462 --> 00:07:28,219
Five bucks on
yesterday's Dodger's game...

98
00:07:28,254 --> 00:07:30,377
the photos fell out,
you saw em-

99
00:07:30,412 --> 00:07:32,500
He ran and naturally,
I gave chase.

100
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:34,380
Naturally.

101
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:28,076
Save me!

102
00:08:28,111 --> 00:08:31,729
Save us!

103
00:08:31,764 --> 00:08:33,701
- Save
- Us!

104
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:35,623
- Save..
- Us!

105
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:37,511
Save you from who?

106
00:08:40,098 --> 00:08:41,342
Who is that?

107
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,763
Who is it?

108
00:09:21,558 --> 00:09:23,134
Evil is coming.

109
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:26,889
And it's up to me to figure out
who's gonna be holding the gun.

110
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:29,391
Morning, Elvis.

111
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:31,107
Pico Mundo Grill
CLOSED

112
00:09:31,142 --> 00:09:32,774
So much of my life
is out of my controI.

113
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:36,351
I would have gone 7 kinds of
crazy if I hadn't simplified.

114
00:09:36,386 --> 00:09:40,018
So I have no motorized vehicles,
no homeownership...

115
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:43,018
no insurance,
and no grand ambitions.

116
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:44,179
Ladies.

117
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:46,108
Eggs! Wreck em and stretch em!

118
00:09:46,143 --> 00:09:48,768
"Wreck em" means scrambled,
and "stretch em" means...

119
00:09:48,803 --> 00:09:49,983
add an extra egg.

120
00:09:50,018 --> 00:09:51,441
Cardiac shingles and hash browns!

121
00:09:51,476 --> 00:09:54,601
"Cardiac shingles"
are toast with lots of butter.

122
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,328
And hash browns...

123
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:57,984
are just hash browns.

124
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:00,720
Not every word
we use is diner lingo.

125
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,608
Just as not every short-order cook

126
00:10:03,643 --> 00:10:07,811
is an undercover detective
for dead people.

127
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:09,268
Duck.

128
00:10:15,311 --> 00:10:18,609
That is Stormy Lewellyn.

129
00:10:18,644 --> 00:10:23,137
Stormy and I are destined
to be together forever.

130
00:10:25,103 --> 00:10:26,477
GYPSY MUMMY ALL SEEING EYE

131
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:31,554
You are destined
to be together forever.

132
00:10:34,478 --> 00:10:37,098
Hey, Chief.
Tummy Tickler coming at ya.

133
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:43,562
You know, I'm still not happy
about what you did yesterday, Oddie.

134
00:10:43,597 --> 00:10:44,813
You could have
gotten yourself killed.

135
00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:47,486
I am not afraid of death.

136
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,010
Of course, I'm not ready to go
on a date with him, either.

137
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:58,147
Would you throw yourself
off a cliff for me?

138
00:10:58,182 --> 00:10:59,029
Of course I would.

139
00:10:59,064 --> 00:11:01,897
Into a river of razor blades
and lemon juice?

140
00:11:01,932 --> 00:11:03,112
Absolutely.

141
00:11:03,147 --> 00:11:05,522
Of course, I'd like to know
the reasoning behind such a request..

142
00:11:05,557 --> 00:11:07,570
but, fortunately for me...

143
00:11:07,605 --> 00:11:10,939
you reek of intelligence
and integrity.

144
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:13,231
And you reek of peach shampoo.

145
00:11:13,266 --> 00:11:15,636
Just the way I like you.

146
00:11:16,898 --> 00:11:19,030
- Chief.
- Morning, Stormy.

147
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:21,356
What's with
the cat-ate-the-canary smile?

148
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:23,229
Tonight is date night.

149
00:11:23,981 --> 00:11:26,268
So you think you're
gonna get yourself some, huh?

150
00:11:26,565 --> 00:11:29,606
- I wouldn't put it quite that way.
- Stormy SpeciaI.

151
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:31,681
- Girlfriend.
- Morning, dude.

152
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:51,240
I call them bodachs.

153
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:52,906
Well, not to their faces, I hope.

154
00:11:52,941 --> 00:11:55,311
I never met anybody
that could see em before.

155
00:11:55,524 --> 00:11:58,234
- Neither have I.
- Everyone told me it's in my head.

156
00:11:58,269 --> 00:11:59,817
Well, you should stop
telling everyone.

157
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,448
I tried telling my parents.

158
00:12:01,483 --> 00:12:03,025
If I told my parents,
I'd ve spent my whole life...

159
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,916
picking winning lottery numbers.

160
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:06,772
You can pick winning lotto numbers?

161
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:10,026
- No, I can't. Stay on point.
- Right. Yeah.

162
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:13,151
Yesterday, when I finally saw one...

163
00:12:13,186 --> 00:12:15,317
I gave him the finger, Homes.

164
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:16,741
Don't you know?

165
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:20,307
If they find out you can see them,
they will kill you.

166
00:12:26,985 --> 00:12:28,561
They will kill you.

167
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:06,326
- Little advice?
- Yeah?

168
00:13:06,361 --> 00:13:08,327
Karla prefers chocolate to flowers

169
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:10,862
and you should get
yourself some candles.

170
00:13:10,897 --> 00:13:11,892
Candles?

171
00:13:12,403 --> 00:13:13,980
Thanks. Good idea.

172
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:21,244
Whew, close.

173
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,946
That would have been
a little awkward.

174
00:13:22,981 --> 00:13:25,400
You two are really something.

175
00:13:25,435 --> 00:13:27,786
I don't know what, but something.

176
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:30,321
We're weird and screwed up
but we're okay.

177
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:31,565
I don't know.

178
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,237
You are...

179
00:13:34,405 --> 00:13:35,703
so cool.

180
00:13:35,738 --> 00:13:39,405
So, you deny me my weirdness,
but agree that I'm screwed up?

181
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,037
You're right.
I see your problem.

182
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:43,363
Weirdness, it can be fun.
It can be kind of cooI.

183
00:13:43,398 --> 00:13:47,114
Screwed-up-ness, not so much.

184
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:49,899
You are quite weird.

185
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:54,698
- Apology accepted.
- I gotta go. Be good, you two.

186
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,322
It's not me you have to worry about.

187
00:13:57,357 --> 00:13:58,650
Don't I know it.

188
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:01,490
I gotta go to work, too, Oddie.

189
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:03,776
- Okay.
- Later, my love.

190
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,652
Stormy!

191
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:26,149
Miss you already.

192
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:32,825
- Living up to his name.
- Every damn day.

193
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,069
Later.

194
00:14:34,491 --> 00:14:38,241
Months often pass
when I don't see a single bodach.

195
00:14:38,276 --> 00:14:39,165
When they do show up...

196
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,325
it's a sure sign that carnage
and bloodshed are not far behind.

197
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,207
Morning.

198
00:14:43,242 --> 00:14:45,446
They don't cause it.
They feed on it.

199
00:14:46,076 --> 00:14:49,690
The more bodachs that show up,
the bigger the eventuaI feast.

200
00:14:52,117 --> 00:14:54,617
They're attracted to evil
like bees to flowers.

201
00:14:54,652 --> 00:14:57,117
They know when death is coming
and want to watch.

202
00:14:57,152 --> 00:14:59,458
They don't show up
for any ordinary death.

203
00:14:59,493 --> 00:15:03,783
They want extreme,
operatic violence and terror.

204
00:15:05,952 --> 00:15:08,869
Penny Kalisto's death
wasn't horrific enough...

205
00:15:08,904 --> 00:15:12,613
to bring a single bodach
into our world.

206
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,277
This town is in serious trouble.

207
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,536
- Bye, Oddie.
- See you, ladies.

208
00:15:22,571 --> 00:15:24,408
Nicolina! Levanna!

209
00:15:28,244 --> 00:15:30,947
Odd, am I really sucking
at this whole "mother" thing?

210
00:15:32,411 --> 00:15:34,460
Well, considering their
last one was a junkie...

211
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:37,119
who left them in your lap
when you were barely 18...

212
00:15:37,154 --> 00:15:40,745
I think you rather rock, Vi.

213
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,775
See you later.

214
00:15:42,328 --> 00:15:44,252
I'm heading this way, too.

215
00:15:44,287 --> 00:15:46,641
Gonna go see Madame Pearl,
get myself read.

216
00:15:46,676 --> 00:15:48,961
Personally,
I don't believe people who say...

217
00:15:48,996 --> 00:15:52,120
they can read minds or palms
and, trust me, tea leaves...

218
00:15:52,155 --> 00:15:53,836
just cloggage
in the garbage disposal.

219
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:56,913
It's just I had this dream
last night you would not believe.

220
00:15:56,948 --> 00:16:00,663
Well, anything short of
a 9-alarm massacre, I can top.

221
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:03,365
I'd never seen myself face-on
in a dream before.

222
00:16:04,705 --> 00:16:06,128
You saw your own face?

223
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:09,705
Me and this guy, we were
both lying dead all busted up...

224
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,407
like we'd been shot
to pieces or something.

225
00:16:17,622 --> 00:16:19,796
You know, I wouldn't worry
about it, Vi.

226
00:16:19,831 --> 00:16:21,905
I mean, have any of
your dreams ever come true?

227
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:23,993
No.

228
00:16:24,622 --> 00:16:27,331
I know most people think
you're just quirky or weird, Odd...

229
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:29,414
except Stormy who thinks
angels fly out of your butt.

230
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:31,164
But I know there's more to it.

231
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,713
You have a secret.

232
00:16:32,748 --> 00:16:34,671
You're either a clairvoyant...

233
00:16:34,706 --> 00:16:36,964
a psychic, a seer,
a soothsayer, or something.

234
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:39,206
Or you got yourself some juice
with a higher power.

235
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:40,088
And I need to know.

236
00:16:40,123 --> 00:16:41,996
Tell me the truth now, Odd.

237
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:44,906
Do you see death in me?

238
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:52,624
No. No, all I see
is my own insensitivity...

239
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:56,072
and a long,
happy life for you, okay?

240
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:03,661
Hey, Vi, the the dead guy
in your dream, what was he wearing?

241
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,374
Wearing? I don't know.

242
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:08,632
Oh! Wait. Yeah...

243
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:13,158
a red and black shirt with
black bowling balls on it.

244
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:22,959
One of my stranger abilities is
that when I need to find someone...

245
00:17:22,993 --> 00:17:25,507
like right now, the creepy
guy in the diner,

246
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:29,501
I can randomly wander around, and
pretty quickly, I'll run into him.

247
00:17:29,536 --> 00:17:31,907
This is a talent for
which I have no name.

248
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:35,126
Stormy calls it psychic magnetism.

249
00:17:35,161 --> 00:17:37,717
TIRE WORLD
Super Summer Sale

250
00:17:37,752 --> 00:17:40,633
That's Tom Jedd.
He was my little league coach.

251
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:44,835
Been hanging around Tire World for
years, although I don't know why.

252
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,210
His death was not caused
by a defective tire.

253
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:50,955
Such a beautifuI girl-

254
00:17:56,794 --> 00:18:00,461
There is something about
a dead man trying to get a laugh...

255
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,535
that just bugs me.

256
00:18:03,586 --> 00:18:06,919
Perhaps because it suggests
that even in death...

257
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:09,835
we still have a pathetic
need to be liked.

258
00:18:10,044 --> 00:18:14,418
As well as the ever-present
ability to humiliate ourselves.

259
00:18:17,211 --> 00:18:18,788
Where are you?

260
00:18:20,337 --> 00:18:22,624
Where are you?

261
00:18:26,379 --> 00:18:27,327
MANAGER Stormy

262
00:18:32,755 --> 00:18:36,588
When I finally have my own shop,
no stupid uniforms.

263
00:18:36,623 --> 00:18:39,088
I think you look adorable.

264
00:18:39,123 --> 00:18:41,038
Adorable? Really?

265
00:18:41,073 --> 00:18:42,953
Puppies are adorable.

266
00:18:44,004 --> 00:18:46,817
Why are you here so early?
You missing me?

267
00:18:46,852 --> 00:18:49,630
Always.
But I'm here looking for a guy.

268
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:50,429
A creepy guy.

269
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:54,214
Well, with you,
there can be no other kind.

270
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:57,745
My psychic magnetism
brought me here.

271
00:19:04,423 --> 00:19:07,337
- That guy?
- That guy.

272
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:10,715
You are better than a bloodhound.

273
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,964
What is that thing on his head?

274
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:13,971
Hair.

275
00:19:14,006 --> 00:19:15,964
It looks like a yellow yarmulke.

276
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:17,597
No, it's hair.

277
00:19:17,632 --> 00:19:19,982
Any of those bodachs with him?

278
00:19:20,017 --> 00:19:22,334
More than I've ever seen before.

279
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,788
You're not shivering
'cause of cold ice cream, are you?

280
00:19:31,716 --> 00:19:33,902
I'm gonna see what this guy's up to.

281
00:19:33,937 --> 00:19:36,090
- Stormy, wait, wait.
- You, sit.

282
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:47,961
You think those fish
are up to something?

283
00:19:48,383 --> 00:19:51,717
All fish do are eat, excrete,
and fornicate all in the same water.

284
00:19:51,752 --> 00:19:53,140
Fish are disgusting.

285
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:55,307
Oh, I never thought so till now.

286
00:19:55,342 --> 00:19:58,175
Your creepy friend is buying
two gallons of the summer special.

287
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,599
Are the flavors significant?

288
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:02,122
That's your department.
I'm just reporting in.

289
00:20:02,426 --> 00:20:04,572
Cherry chocolate coconut chunk?

290
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:06,683
Coconut cherry chocolate chunk.

291
00:20:06,718 --> 00:20:11,176
I didn't realize the grammar was
so rigid in the ice-cream business.

292
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,550
Well, now you know.

293
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:18,590
This is bad for business.

294
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,999
Why? No one can see em but me.

295
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:27,172
Well, how could a bunch
of slithering, evil spirits...

296
00:20:27,207 --> 00:20:29,419
and guy who look like
fungus be good for business?

297
00:20:30,052 --> 00:20:32,541
Fungus Man scares me.
Can't you forget him?

298
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:33,850
I have a gift.

299
00:20:33,885 --> 00:20:36,177
It wouldn't have been given to me
if I wasn't supposed to use it.

300
00:20:36,212 --> 00:20:38,261
- Maybe it's not a gift.
- It's a gift.

301
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:40,548
I still got the box it came in.

302
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:42,727
Here. Take my keys.

303
00:20:42,762 --> 00:20:44,880
And please show up
for dinner alive...

304
00:20:44,915 --> 00:20:46,999
because, remember,
I can't see the dead.

305
00:21:22,763 --> 00:21:25,437
If someone is going
to cause extreme violence...

306
00:21:25,472 --> 00:21:29,270
especially on a massive scale,
which this is starting to look like...

307
00:21:29,305 --> 00:21:34,009
bodachs will not leave him untiI the
last ounce of blood has been spilled.

308
00:21:35,556 --> 00:21:38,589
But they lost interest
in Fungus Man.

309
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,350
Winstons, Camels, and Marlboros.

310
00:22:20,385 --> 00:22:23,265
Fungus Man has friends.

311
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,051
Oh, now would be
a good time to run.

312
00:24:34,023 --> 00:24:35,054
Bodachs.

313
00:26:14,737 --> 00:26:17,356
- Hey.
- Loop me in, odd one.

314
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:21,612
I think I just achieved a personaI
best in the "jump and gasp" event.

315
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:23,504
Don't be such a scaredy-cat.

316
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:25,328
I found a gateway to hell.

317
00:26:25,363 --> 00:26:26,911
I'm walking back to it right now.

318
00:26:26,946 --> 00:26:29,738
Most people would have
the good sense to run away from it.

319
00:26:29,773 --> 00:26:33,186
- Well, I'm not like most people.
- Not in the least.

320
00:26:39,947 --> 00:26:41,523
It's gone now.

321
00:26:43,697 --> 00:26:44,829
Or hidden.

322
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,981
So, is Fungus Bob a man or
something new in the neighborhood?

323
00:26:48,281 --> 00:26:49,939
I don't know.

324
00:26:52,365 --> 00:26:54,288
This place looks like
some kind of shrine.

325
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:55,246
UNABOMBER...
Theodore Kaczynski Arrested and...

326
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,198
Bundy Claims...
Police Believe The Number To Be...

327
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:57,621
Cannibal Killer
DECAPITATED UNABOMBER

328
00:26:57,656 --> 00:27:01,115
Shrine of guys that like to
make belts out of women's nipples.

329
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,359
What?

330
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,114
Who is this guy?

331
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,985
His real name is Robert Robertson.

332
00:27:11,615 --> 00:27:13,789
Well, hello Fungus Bob.

333
00:27:13,824 --> 00:27:16,324
Did you check the refrigerator
for any severed heads?

334
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:18,039
No, I didn't open his refrigerator.

335
00:27:18,074 --> 00:27:20,490
Where else would you expect
to find severed heads?

336
00:27:20,525 --> 00:27:22,362
I wasn't looking for any.

337
00:27:24,449 --> 00:27:26,581
Stormy, Stormy, someone's here.
I got to go.

338
00:27:26,616 --> 00:27:28,664
We don't know
what this guy's planning to do yet.

339
00:27:28,699 --> 00:27:31,188
You know what? Let me ask him
to wait outside untiI I'm finished.

340
00:27:32,866 --> 00:27:35,272
I can feel that.

341
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,491
Wait a minute.
What's today's date?

342
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:41,790
August 14th.

343
00:27:41,825 --> 00:27:44,117
The page to August 15th
is torn out of his calendar.

344
00:27:44,152 --> 00:27:46,322
That's tomorrow.
What happens tomorrow?

345
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:50,284
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Get out of there, Oddie.

346
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:53,076
Maybe he has a file on himself,
you know?

347
00:27:53,111 --> 00:27:54,833
Unsolved murders and atrocities.

348
00:27:54,868 --> 00:27:57,154
Chief and I could figure
out a way to entrap him.

349
00:27:59,035 --> 00:28:01,951
So, what's in it?
Is he a mass murderer?

350
00:28:01,986 --> 00:28:03,279
No.

351
00:28:05,576 --> 00:28:07,416
But I think he wants to be.

352
00:28:07,451 --> 00:28:11,113
Hey, Bob!
Robert, where the hell are you?

353
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,815
I want my gun back!

354
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:21,110
Oh, shit. Damn dogs.

355
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,077
Shut up, you hear me?

356
00:28:29,661 --> 00:28:31,085
Shut up you damn dogs!

357
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,319
One of these days, bang!
You hear me?

358
00:28:40,995 --> 00:28:43,620
Wyatt is out back here burning
some perfectly good steaks.

359
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:44,745
Thanks, Karla.

360
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,960
Chief.

361
00:28:45,995 --> 00:28:49,037
Odd, I hope you haven't come
here to dampen my evening.

362
00:28:49,072 --> 00:28:50,460
I share your hope, sir.

363
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,058
Been communing with the dead?

364
00:28:52,093 --> 00:28:54,000
It's not about who's dead, sir.

365
00:28:54,035 --> 00:28:55,907
It's about who soon might be.

366
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,336
We call him Fungus Bob.

367
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:03,496
Yeah, I saw him enter the grill, but
he didn't strike me as suspicious.

368
00:29:03,531 --> 00:29:05,670
Just unfortunate.

369
00:29:05,705 --> 00:29:08,913
Oh, you don't have the advantage
of seeing his fan club, sir.

370
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:12,336
I guarantee you hell on earth
is coming to Pico Mundo.

371
00:29:12,371 --> 00:29:15,746
You know sometimes you expect me
to walk a dangerously narrow line.

372
00:29:15,781 --> 00:29:19,122
That's just because I've got such
great respect for your balance, sir.

373
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,806
Son that sounds perilously close
to being bullshit.

374
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:24,455
There's a little bit of
bullshit in it. A little.

375
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,504
But it's mostly sincere.

376
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:28,935
Odd this is one of
our newer officers...

377
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,331
- Bern Eckles.
- Oh, hi. We met yesterday.

378
00:29:31,366 --> 00:29:32,963
Good collar, that Harlo character.

379
00:29:32,998 --> 00:29:34,873
I can't believe
I once dated that perv.

380
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:36,172
And of course you know Lysette.

381
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:38,706
Bern, I want you
to do a little DMV check on..

382
00:29:38,741 --> 00:29:40,993
this guy Odd was telling me about.

383
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:44,957
I think Officer Eckles
is a little worried

384
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,089
I might try to hook up with you.

385
00:29:46,124 --> 00:29:47,790
Karla and the chief
are trying to set us up...

386
00:29:47,825 --> 00:29:49,662
him being new to the force and all.

387
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:53,624
It's like cleaning fluid
with sugar in it.

388
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:55,339
Which reminds me, how's your dad?

389
00:29:55,374 --> 00:29:59,332
He's selling pieces of the moon
online, vacation home sites.

390
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:00,255
Is that legal?

391
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:02,791
He certainly doesn't guarantee
the quality of the air.

392
00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:05,083
And how's it going with Bronwen?

393
00:30:05,118 --> 00:30:06,624
She prefers "Stormy. "

394
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:07,999
Who wouldn't?

395
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:10,882
Did you used to play piano?

396
00:30:10,917 --> 00:30:13,291
I did, yeah, for years.
How'd you know that?

397
00:30:13,326 --> 00:30:15,583
'Cause you have really
beautifuI hands.

398
00:30:15,618 --> 00:30:17,160
I bet you play like a dream.

399
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,458
You know Odd, you're a strange one.

400
00:30:22,493 --> 00:30:25,168
Yeah, I can't disagree with that.

401
00:30:25,202 --> 00:30:26,957
Bit of an oddball.

402
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:29,876
That was my nickname
all through high school.

403
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,601
But you do have your charms.

404
00:30:31,636 --> 00:30:33,257
That's what Stormy says.

405
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:34,925
Personally,
I find it rather dubious.

406
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,085
You know, if you ever decide
to give cooking lessons...

407
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,716
you should give me a call.

408
00:30:39,751 --> 00:30:42,341
I bet you really know
how to whisk.

409
00:30:42,376 --> 00:30:44,876
Sure, yeah,
with scrambled eggs and stuff.

410
00:30:44,911 --> 00:30:47,602
But, pancakes, you really,
you got to fold em.

411
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,293
But, mostly,
I just fry, fry, fry, you know?

412
00:30:50,328 --> 00:30:52,165
Hey, Odd. We got to talk.

413
00:30:53,627 --> 00:30:55,968
Robertson moved here
five months ago.

414
00:30:56,003 --> 00:30:58,669
Before that,
he was living with his mother.

415
00:30:58,704 --> 00:31:01,374
Inherited a shitload
when she died last year.

416
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:04,045
Clean record, though.
Not even a speeding ticket.

417
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,968
How'd his mother die?

418
00:31:06,003 --> 00:31:08,774
Officer Eckles is checking on
that right now.

419
00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:11,545
But otherwise,
I got squat on your Fungus Bob.

420
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,426
I can't hold him.

421
00:31:12,461 --> 00:31:16,211
All right, well, you do agree that
he's strange and suspicious, right?

422
00:31:16,246 --> 00:31:19,128
If strange and suspicious were
enough to put someone in jail...

423
00:31:19,163 --> 00:31:21,001
you'd already be there.

424
00:31:22,378 --> 00:31:23,670
You're gonna watch him right?

425
00:31:23,705 --> 00:31:24,927
Only because you're never wrong,

426
00:31:24,962 --> 00:31:27,170
I'll put on a tail on him
and watch his house.

427
00:31:27,205 --> 00:31:29,879
You go and have
your dinner with Stormy.

428
00:31:29,914 --> 00:31:30,761
She's the one.

429
00:31:30,796 --> 00:31:32,940
You are one smooth operator, Odd.

430
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:35,085
She must love to hear you say that.

431
00:31:35,504 --> 00:31:37,045
I love to hear me say it.

432
00:31:49,047 --> 00:31:51,338
You better not be hauling
any dead guys on my scooter.

433
00:31:51,373 --> 00:31:53,297
- Dead don't ride scooters.
- Just saying.

434
00:31:53,332 --> 00:31:55,089
I'd have to scrub
the seat for hours.

435
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:56,804
Destroying the pleather.

436
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:59,756
I see you left your hormone
spigot running, griddle boy.

437
00:31:59,791 --> 00:32:01,960
Crank it shut.
This is a church.

438
00:32:05,172 --> 00:32:06,631
I know it's a church.

439
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:08,055
I have a brain, you know.

440
00:32:08,089 --> 00:32:09,673
You know why I call you Pooh Bear?

441
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:10,972
Because I'm so cuddly.

442
00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:13,411
Because his head is full of stuffin'

443
00:32:18,423 --> 00:32:19,722
Now listen to me, odd one.

444
00:32:19,757 --> 00:32:21,757
I don't want you going back
to that creepy room again.

445
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:23,680
It doesn't exist anymore.

446
00:32:23,715 --> 00:32:25,507
Well, don't go looking for
it hoping it'll come back.

447
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:27,555
- Never crossed my mind.
- Yes, it did.

448
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:30,194
- Yes, it did.
- It is a gate to the underworld...

449
00:32:30,229 --> 00:32:32,764
and you are forbidden by me
to ever play in it again.

450
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,382
It's hard enough living with a guy who
helps dead people without having to

451
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:38,090
trek all the way down to hell
to pull his ass out of the fire.

452
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:40,091
Since when are we living together?

453
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:40,973
We will be.

454
00:32:41,008 --> 00:32:43,508
Oh, I guess I didn't think
"Let's put a pin in it" meant "Yes. "

455
00:32:43,543 --> 00:32:46,009
You have to learn to listen
with more than just your ears.

456
00:32:46,043 --> 00:32:48,710
Stormy, what body part am
I supposed to listen with?

457
00:32:49,758 --> 00:32:52,383
Right. My heart.
I'm supposed to listen with my heart.

458
00:32:52,418 --> 00:32:53,599
Listen with my heart.

459
00:32:53,634 --> 00:32:58,842
I will do something big
to improve our financial situation.

460
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:00,766
- Your idea about selling car tires?
- Bigger.

461
00:33:00,801 --> 00:33:03,092
And what, from your perspective,
is bigger than tires?

462
00:33:03,127 --> 00:33:04,109
- Shoes.
- Shoes?

463
00:33:04,144 --> 00:33:05,057
Yeah, think about it.

464
00:33:05,092 --> 00:33:07,738
A family of 5 might have 2 cars
but they have 10 feet.

465
00:33:07,773 --> 00:33:10,349
Not only that, but they need
different kinds of shoes.

466
00:33:10,384 --> 00:33:12,676
Dress shoes, winkle pickers,
high-tops, low-tops, running shoes-

467
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:14,760
But not you. You have
5 pairs of the same sneakers.

468
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:16,964
- Like I said
- You're not like most people.

469
00:33:17,885 --> 00:33:20,089
Not in the least.

470
00:33:28,302 --> 00:33:29,969
Do you want crackers
with your cheese?

471
00:33:30,003 --> 00:33:31,184
We have a problem.

472
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:32,886
Crackers aren't a problem,
just a choice.

473
00:33:32,921 --> 00:33:33,684
- Come on.
- What?

474
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:35,591
- Come on! It's Fungus Bob!
- What!

475
00:33:36,844 --> 00:33:38,716
He followed me. I don't know how.

476
00:33:39,886 --> 00:33:43,184
Shit! Come on! Come on!

477
00:33:43,219 --> 00:33:44,852
- It's him? You're sure?
- Sure, I'm sure!

478
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:47,386
You don't think the two of us
could kick his ass?

479
00:33:47,421 --> 00:33:48,927
Not this guy.

480
00:34:10,805 --> 00:34:12,261
- Come on!
- The sacristy!

481
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,879
The back door.
Come on. Come on.

482
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:21,937
Wait! Wait. Come here.

483
00:34:21,971 --> 00:34:24,674
We're heading towards danger,
not away from it. I can feeI it.

484
00:34:26,138 --> 00:34:28,923
It's like he's everywhere.
He's in front of us. He's behind us.

485
00:34:29,971 --> 00:34:31,430
Come on.
Let's go back the way we came.

486
00:34:31,465 --> 00:34:33,383
- Let's call the cops.
- No time.

487
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:35,302
I have a better plan.
You stay here.

488
00:34:35,723 --> 00:34:37,285
I'm gonna run over there
and open the door.

489
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,848
If he doesn't lunge through,
you run that way.

490
00:34:38,883 --> 00:34:40,979
If, however, he does lunge through,

491
00:34:41,014 --> 00:34:43,097
you run this way and
I'll try to follow you.

492
00:34:43,132 --> 00:34:44,633
Some plan, odd one.

493
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:46,133
It's the best I've got.

494
00:34:46,556 --> 00:34:48,097
Full of stuffin'.

495
00:35:02,265 --> 00:35:04,973
Does that mean "Get on with it"
or "Up yours"?

496
00:35:05,008 --> 00:35:06,431
Unbelievable.

497
00:35:06,973 --> 00:35:08,004
Right.

498
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,552
Come on! Come on!

499
00:36:01,352 --> 00:36:02,567
Chief, it's Stormy.

500
00:36:02,602 --> 00:36:05,310
I'm sorry to drop in on date night,
but here's Odd.

501
00:36:05,345 --> 00:36:07,983
Sir, if you send a car real
quick to St. Bart's...

502
00:36:08,018 --> 00:36:10,728
you may be able to catch
Robertson trashing the sacristy...

503
00:36:10,763 --> 00:36:11,942
or even the whole church.

504
00:36:11,977 --> 00:36:14,026
What was he doing
vandalizing St. Bart's?

505
00:36:14,061 --> 00:36:16,561
He was trying to catch me
and Stormy in the belfry.

506
00:36:16,596 --> 00:36:18,520
What were you and Stormy
doing in the belfry?

507
00:36:18,555 --> 00:36:20,682
Well, we were having a picnic, sir.

508
00:36:20,717 --> 00:36:22,810
I'm sure that makes sense to you.

509
00:36:25,395 --> 00:36:28,889
My guy at Robertsons house said
he still hasn't been home yet.

510
00:36:28,924 --> 00:36:32,385
Yeah, because apparently
Bob's been too busy following me.

511
00:36:33,228 --> 00:36:34,319
Oh, one second.

512
00:36:34,354 --> 00:36:36,646
- Where are you going?
- To get some food.

513
00:36:36,681 --> 00:36:38,937
How can you think
of dinner right now?

514
00:36:38,972 --> 00:36:40,778
Because I'm hungry.

515
00:36:40,812 --> 00:36:43,727
Look, Odd.
Vandalism, big deaI.

516
00:36:44,146 --> 00:36:47,643
I thought you said this guy
was gonna bring on the apocalypse.

517
00:36:47,678 --> 00:36:51,139
Yes, sir, on August 15th,
which is less than 3 hours away.

518
00:36:51,229 --> 00:36:54,346
Trust me, that is the day that
Pico Mundo will never forget.

519
00:36:57,063 --> 00:36:58,487
Lyle!

520
00:36:58,522 --> 00:37:00,668
Oh. Hi, Odd. Hi Stormy.

521
00:37:00,703 --> 00:37:02,813
- Hi, Ozzie.
- Hey, Oz.

522
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,271
Odd.

523
00:37:05,813 --> 00:37:06,772
- I'll be right back.
- Lyle, you know that

524
00:37:07,611 --> 00:37:08,641
I know guys who know guys, right?
Right. - Right.

525
00:37:08,676 --> 00:37:11,564
So if you guys don't stop
messing up my takeout orders..

526
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,314
you're the one that's gonna
get taken out. Get it?

527
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:14,321
- Got it.
- Good.

528
00:37:14,356 --> 00:37:16,439
Oz, Oz, watch your blood pressure.

529
00:37:16,474 --> 00:37:18,071
My blood- Hey, Odd...

530
00:37:18,106 --> 00:37:19,897
my blood has got
cholesterol molecules

531
00:37:19,932 --> 00:37:21,196
the size of marshmallows in it...

532
00:37:21,231 --> 00:37:23,648
and if it wasn't for a little
righteous outrage every now and again

533
00:37:23,683 --> 00:37:25,722
my arteries would
completely collapse.

534
00:37:28,106 --> 00:37:31,649
I finished that
trinket you asked for.

535
00:37:31,684 --> 00:37:33,639
Perfect.

536
00:37:37,065 --> 00:37:39,322
Wow, Oz, what exactly is this?

537
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:43,024
It's a steel heart 6 inches
in diameter, like you said.

538
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:44,448
No, I said...

539
00:37:44,483 --> 00:37:48,107
"A piece of steel 6 inches
in diameter to go over a heart. "

540
00:37:48,142 --> 00:37:50,608
Well, man,
I embellished, you know?

541
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,156
I get in the moment.

542
00:37:52,191 --> 00:37:54,774
I mean, why would Stormy
wanna wear that?

543
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:56,615
It's not for Stormy.

544
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,896
I keep having this image of a...

545
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,474
a bullet going through a heart.

546
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,557
It's perfect. Thank you.

547
00:38:13,526 --> 00:38:14,556
Hey, Chief.

548
00:38:17,192 --> 00:38:20,109
- This place is trashed.
- Yeah, it was Bob Robertson, sir.

549
00:38:20,144 --> 00:38:21,949
I'm sure you're right.
You always are.

550
00:38:21,984 --> 00:38:25,193
But he was long gone.
Didn't leave a single print.

551
00:38:25,228 --> 00:38:27,485
Even the chalices were spotless.

552
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,408
Weird, huh?

553
00:38:28,443 --> 00:38:32,068
I'll give my psychic magnetism a try
to see if I can find him again.

554
00:38:32,103 --> 00:38:33,408
Take Stormy home first.

555
00:38:33,443 --> 00:38:35,318
- Like hell he will!
- I heard that.

556
00:38:35,353 --> 00:38:36,432
He heard that.

557
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,325
Chief, you know
I love Oddie desperately...

558
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,527
so madly I would cut off my hand if
that made any sense as proof of love.

559
00:38:43,562 --> 00:38:45,528
And now I find out
there's a guy trying to kill him.

560
00:38:45,563 --> 00:38:47,813
No one was trying
to kill me, Stormy.

561
00:38:48,236 --> 00:38:50,076
What, you think
he was hitting on you?

562
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:53,445
You know, this is the craziest
conversation I've ever had.

563
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,944
Odd you're a fountain
of crazy conversations.

564
00:38:55,979 --> 00:38:57,272
A geyser.

565
00:38:59,278 --> 00:39:02,399
Time feels like
a powerfuI black wave...

566
00:39:02,434 --> 00:39:05,520
that wishes to crash down
and engulf us.

567
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:08,933
I must run faster.

568
00:39:17,404 --> 00:39:19,453
BOWLING

569
00:39:19,488 --> 00:39:21,883
Why did I drive here?

570
00:39:21,918 --> 00:39:24,244
Green Moon BOWLING

571
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,744
Oh, my God.
Oddie, your nightmare...

572
00:39:26,779 --> 00:39:29,572
the slaughter of the bowling alley
people, is it happening here tonight?

573
00:39:29,607 --> 00:39:31,147
- Now?
- No.

574
00:39:31,447 --> 00:39:32,579
No, no, I checked this place.

575
00:39:32,614 --> 00:39:34,779
The employees here wear green
and gold shirts.

576
00:39:34,814 --> 00:39:36,412
- So?
- So, in my dreams,

577
00:39:36,447 --> 00:39:40,108
the victims wear red-and-black shirts
with little black nbowling balls on em.

578
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:43,620
And I don't see
Fungus Bob's car anywhere.

579
00:39:43,655 --> 00:39:45,406
You think the slaughter of
the bowling alley people

580
00:39:45,441 --> 00:39:46,780
and Fungus Bob are connected?

581
00:39:46,815 --> 00:39:48,108
Yeah.

582
00:39:49,364 --> 00:39:51,236
Yeah, yeah, I know they are.

583
00:39:57,281 --> 00:39:58,939
GREEN MOON BOWLING

584
00:40:14,157 --> 00:40:15,946
They got new uniforms.

585
00:40:27,616 --> 00:40:29,157
Don't you dare.

586
00:40:29,574 --> 00:40:31,447
Oh, Wyatt.

587
00:40:32,408 --> 00:40:36,242
You said that whatever was gonna
happen wouldn't happen untiI tomorrow.

588
00:40:36,277 --> 00:40:38,551
- Yes, sir, but you see-
- I still got an hour.

589
00:40:38,585 --> 00:40:40,825
I know, sir.
I just want to keep you up to date.

590
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,457
I think there's a good chance that

591
00:40:42,492 --> 00:40:44,632
Bob Robertson might
come to Green Moon Alley...

592
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:46,774
to do a little more
than just hook some balls.

593
00:40:56,243 --> 00:40:59,285
Maybe you wanna send a guy out here
to, you know, keep an eye out?

594
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,417
Any of those bodarch things around?

595
00:41:01,452 --> 00:41:05,610
Bodachs. No, sir,
but they will show up when he does.

596
00:41:05,743 --> 00:41:08,446
Yeah-yeah. All right.
I'll send a guy right over.

597
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:11,991
Something doesn't feel right.

598
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,833
Something's wrong.

599
00:41:13,868 --> 00:41:15,431
Are you nuts?
Everything's wrong.

600
00:41:15,466 --> 00:41:16,959
There's going to be a massacre...

601
00:41:16,994 --> 00:41:18,973
and I'll bet you
it's going to happen here.

602
00:41:19,008 --> 00:41:20,917
No, all we know is it's
the same uniforms,

603
00:41:20,952 --> 00:41:23,451
so it's the same
group of people getting killed.

604
00:41:23,486 --> 00:41:25,950
But tomorrow,
any of them could be anywhere.

605
00:41:28,661 --> 00:41:31,991
God, I'm missing something.
I'm missing a piece of the puzzle.

606
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,778
I need to see Viola.

607
00:41:39,786 --> 00:41:40,948
Evening!

608
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:44,162
- Odd Thomas, right?
- Yeah.

609
00:41:44,197 --> 00:41:45,430
Miss Lewellyn.

610
00:41:45,465 --> 00:41:46,627
The chief sent me.

611
00:41:46,662 --> 00:41:49,281
So you know this guy, right?

612
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:53,327
I've seen him a couple times today
but no, I don't know him.

613
00:41:53,537 --> 00:41:56,371
Yeah, chief says,
If you see him reach for his pocket

614
00:41:56,406 --> 00:41:58,243
he's probably not going
for a breath mint.

615
00:41:59,704 --> 00:42:01,627
- Wise words from a wise man.
- Yeah.

616
00:42:01,662 --> 00:42:04,779
So what exactly makes this guy
so suspicious and dangerous?

617
00:42:05,205 --> 00:42:07,823
He came into the grill
for lunch today.

618
00:42:08,871 --> 00:42:11,158
That's it? You served him lunch?

619
00:42:11,193 --> 00:42:13,446
- He was weird.
- How weird?

620
00:42:13,538 --> 00:42:14,545
He had weird friends.

621
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,039
- He has friends?
- Weird ones.

622
00:42:16,074 --> 00:42:17,413
How weird?

623
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:19,283
Very weird.

624
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:26,664
And a couple hours ago,
he got very aggressive with me.

625
00:42:26,699 --> 00:42:28,629
Wait. A couple hours ago,

626
00:42:28,664 --> 00:42:32,077
this guy, Bob Robertson
got aggressive with you?

627
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:35,415
Look, the creep made a pass at me
and Odd told him to back off...

628
00:42:35,449 --> 00:42:38,247
and the creep got,
you know, creepy.

629
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:40,326
Creepy.

630
00:42:42,831 --> 00:42:45,623
Hey, Simon, I've been dying
to know what this tattoo means.

631
00:42:45,658 --> 00:42:47,282
- Do you mind?
- POD

632
00:42:49,082 --> 00:42:51,037
Well, Stormy...

633
00:42:51,249 --> 00:42:53,505
when I was a teenager,
I was a mess.

634
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:56,519
If it wasn't for the police
academy and the good Lord

635
00:42:56,554 --> 00:42:59,499
Let's just say this tattoo
is a crude obscenity...

636
00:42:59,534 --> 00:43:01,454
that I'd rather not
say the meaning of.

637
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:04,575
Well, what a gentleman you are.

638
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,540
Nighty-night, Simon.

639
00:43:09,292 --> 00:43:10,535
Night.

640
00:43:14,167 --> 00:43:15,715
You manipulate me like that?

641
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,334
Good heavens odd one,
I manipulate you every day.

642
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:19,673
- You do?
- Yes.

643
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:22,625
Gently, of course, and with great
affection and you always like it.

644
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,869
Oh, I do?

645
00:43:24,292 --> 00:43:26,549
You are so adorable.

646
00:43:26,584 --> 00:43:28,716
- I'm not adorable.
- Oh, please.

647
00:43:28,751 --> 00:43:31,459
Puppies, puppies,
little puppies, are adorable.

648
00:43:31,494 --> 00:43:35,618
You and puppies,
totally adorable.

649
00:43:38,542 --> 00:43:40,533
I had a feeling
I'd see you tonight.

650
00:43:41,168 --> 00:43:43,459
- It's about my dream, isn't it?
- You said you were shot.

651
00:43:43,494 --> 00:43:47,259
My skull was all whacked,
my eyeball swollen.

652
00:43:47,294 --> 00:43:49,856
You know dreams have nothing
to do with the reaI future, Vi.

653
00:43:49,891 --> 00:43:52,418
We've already been over that
territory, but here you are.

654
00:43:52,453 --> 00:43:54,077
Where are you in your dream?

655
00:43:54,502 --> 00:43:56,998
No place.
A dream place. Fuzzy.

656
00:43:57,033 --> 00:43:59,493
Are you planning on going bowling?

657
00:43:59,919 --> 00:44:01,940
Bowling? Did you hit your head?

658
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:03,926
What are your plans tomorrow?

659
00:44:03,961 --> 00:44:07,250
Levanna's birthday is Sunday,
but tips are real good on a Sunday

660
00:44:07,285 --> 00:44:10,539
so I was gonna work it and celebrate
her birthday tomorrow instead.

661
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:14,087
A lot of people died in that
dream of yours, huh Odd?

662
00:44:14,122 --> 00:44:15,331
Yeah, they did.

663
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,828
Your dreams ever come true?

664
00:44:18,129 --> 00:44:19,704
Sometimes.

665
00:44:20,962 --> 00:44:22,206
I thought so.

666
00:44:24,171 --> 00:44:25,829
Close your eyes, Vi.

667
00:44:36,587 --> 00:44:40,203
In your dream what do you see?

668
00:44:40,838 --> 00:44:43,456
- What do you hear?
- All right.

669
00:44:44,379 --> 00:44:46,666
I'm running.

670
00:44:47,297 --> 00:44:51,456
There's suddenly lots of
flashing lights with...

671
00:44:52,214 --> 00:44:54,086
old-fashioned kiddie music.

672
00:44:56,672 --> 00:45:00,120
And then I hear a big crowd,
a roaring one.

673
00:45:01,173 --> 00:45:03,096
Like in a big football stadium.

674
00:45:03,131 --> 00:45:06,165
And then there's the sound
of water, gushing water.

675
00:45:07,631 --> 00:45:08,875
How do you die?

676
00:45:09,714 --> 00:45:13,127
It's like someone hit me with
a baseball bat, quick, like twice.

677
00:45:13,673 --> 00:45:16,381
I scream and
fall to my hands and knees.

678
00:45:16,416 --> 00:45:18,104
My hands slip, slippery.

679
00:45:18,139 --> 00:45:19,792
What are you slipping on?

680
00:45:20,215 --> 00:45:23,090
Oh, God. Blood.
There's blood everywhere.

681
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:25,965
What's under the blood,
under your hands?

682
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,899
A floor, grass, concrete?

683
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:29,798
I'm staring at the dead man.

684
00:45:32,216 --> 00:45:35,131
Do you know him?
Do you recognize him?

685
00:45:39,716 --> 00:45:42,631
Oh, dear Lord, Odd.
So many dead bodies.

686
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:46,663
Odd, you have to stop
this from happening.

687
00:45:51,175 --> 00:45:53,196
Oh, Odd, is there any hope
this could pass?

688
00:45:53,231 --> 00:45:55,217
If you listen to Oddie,
you'll be just fine.

689
00:45:55,251 --> 00:45:56,247
No.

690
00:45:57,508 --> 00:46:00,900
Fate is not a straight road.
There are many forks in it.

691
00:46:00,935 --> 00:46:04,292
You have the free will to choose
which one you take, but...

692
00:46:04,717 --> 00:46:06,141
sometimes it will bend around...

693
00:46:06,176 --> 00:46:09,588
and bring you straight back
to that same stubborn fate.

694
00:46:11,384 --> 00:46:13,126
I just wanna check on the girls.

695
00:46:18,468 --> 00:46:20,340
They're so beautiful, Viola.

696
00:46:21,052 --> 00:46:22,927
And they're such good girls.

697
00:46:22,962 --> 00:46:24,776
They're lucky to have you.

698
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:26,591
That's what everyone says.

699
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:56,174
Odd?

700
00:46:57,428 --> 00:46:59,715
- Anything wrong?
- No.

701
00:47:00,137 --> 00:47:04,096
No, no, no. I just wanted
to make sure the girls were safe.

702
00:47:04,131 --> 00:47:06,227
And with the bars on the windows

703
00:47:06,262 --> 00:47:09,095
I taught them how to work
the emergency release myself.

704
00:47:23,346 --> 00:47:27,720
Well, looks like everything's
a- okay in here.

705
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:31,534
Step one, do not stay here.

706
00:47:31,569 --> 00:47:33,437
I'll go to my grandma's.

707
00:47:33,472 --> 00:47:34,618
Don't tell your grandma
you're coming.

708
00:47:34,653 --> 00:47:35,764
Don't tell the girls
where you're going.

709
00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:37,594
I don't want you overheard.

710
00:47:37,629 --> 00:47:39,354
- By who?
- By anyone.

711
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:42,008
Or anything. Just go with it.

712
00:47:44,389 --> 00:47:47,921
Step two is don't go bowling if
for some reason you get the itch.

713
00:47:52,306 --> 00:47:54,181
I can't believe we're leaving
those horrid things...

714
00:47:54,216 --> 00:47:55,974
hovering around those sweet girls.

715
00:47:56,009 --> 00:47:56,855
They won't hurt em.

716
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:58,974
They just want to smell em
before they die.

717
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:00,106
God.

718
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:03,348
Look, Stormy, there's nothing
I can do about bodachs, okay?

719
00:48:03,383 --> 00:48:05,188
And right now
I wouldn't even if I could.

720
00:48:05,223 --> 00:48:08,474
I need em to help me see the danger
coming so I can maybe prevent it.

721
00:48:08,509 --> 00:48:11,388
And when they eventually find out
that you can see them?

722
00:48:16,474 --> 00:48:17,898
Oddie, will you ever leave here?

723
00:48:17,933 --> 00:48:21,266
Well, I sure hope I don't end up like
Tom Jedd hanging out at Tire World.

724
00:48:21,301 --> 00:48:23,257
I meant while you're alive.

725
00:48:26,059 --> 00:48:28,515
Hey. Hey, Stormy.

726
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:30,972
Hey, hey. Look, look.

727
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:35,434
Look, Stormy,
if you want us to go, I'll go.

728
00:48:35,469 --> 00:48:36,891
It's not that. It's-

729
00:48:38,267 --> 00:48:40,423
I am just so scared for you, Oddie.

730
00:48:40,767 --> 00:48:44,180
So scared, ever since
I saw that creep Fungus Bob.

731
00:48:45,643 --> 00:48:47,099
I'm sorry. I just-

732
00:48:48,476 --> 00:48:50,217
I love you so much.

733
00:48:55,226 --> 00:48:56,650
My Pooh Bear.

734
00:48:56,685 --> 00:48:59,935
I promise you on
the other side of tomorrow...

735
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:03,550
I will have all my stuffing intact.

736
00:49:08,477 --> 00:49:10,135
That must be for you.

737
00:49:57,229 --> 00:49:58,557
Oh, God!

738
00:49:59,605 --> 00:50:03,000
I heard the scream.
She ran across my yard.

739
00:50:03,035 --> 00:50:06,396
I saw the dogs following her.
I grabbed my gun.

740
00:50:07,647 --> 00:50:08,981
I shot the dogs.

741
00:50:09,015 --> 00:50:10,354
It's on.

742
00:50:12,856 --> 00:50:15,558
All right. Here's what we know.

743
00:50:16,189 --> 00:50:21,272
Lysette left my barbecue with
Officer Eckles at around 7:45.

744
00:50:21,307 --> 00:50:23,947
He dropped her off at home
clocked in at 8:00,

745
00:50:23,981 --> 00:50:26,690
and was manning the front
desk when he got the call.

746
00:50:26,725 --> 00:50:30,113
So somewhere
between 8:00 and midnight,

747
00:50:30,148 --> 00:50:32,753
Lysette was whacked in the eye
and then tied up

748
00:50:32,788 --> 00:50:35,357
and gagged and hauled
all the way the hell out here

749
00:50:35,392 --> 00:50:37,822
and had two Rottweilers
sicked on her.

750
00:50:37,857 --> 00:50:40,565
Hey, Chief. What's with
the guy who shot the dogs?

751
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,197
His name's Kevin Goss.

752
00:50:42,232 --> 00:50:44,280
He was teaching a class
from 6:00 to 10:00...

753
00:50:44,315 --> 00:50:47,107
then he went to Starbucks
till they closed at midnight.

754
00:50:47,142 --> 00:50:49,513
He got home about
two minutes too late.

755
00:50:49,816 --> 00:50:53,691
Sir? I've actually seen
those Rottweilers before.

756
00:50:53,726 --> 00:50:55,563
They belong to Bob Robertson.

757
00:50:58,692 --> 00:51:00,148
All right!

758
00:51:00,567 --> 00:51:03,900
I want an A. P. B.
put out on this guy now!

759
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,198
- Find him!
- Yes, sir.

760
00:51:05,233 --> 00:51:08,275
Simon, I want you to go back
over to Robertson's house.

761
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:09,941
I'll have a search
warrant in the morning

762
00:51:09,976 --> 00:51:11,157
as soon as the courthouse opens.

763
00:51:11,192 --> 00:51:14,942
Sir, no offense, but I wasted most
of the day staking out that house.

764
00:51:14,977 --> 00:51:18,693
Then I went to the bowling alley
and stayed there untiI they closed.

765
00:51:18,728 --> 00:51:20,019
Nothing happened.

766
00:51:20,651 --> 00:51:23,270
Nobody showed.
It was a complete waste of my time.

767
00:51:23,901 --> 00:51:28,891
Sir, are we sure this Robertson
character isn't just a wild goose chase?

768
00:51:29,401 --> 00:51:31,401
Exactly where were you between
the hours of 8:00 and 10:00?

769
00:51:31,436 --> 00:51:35,146
- He was with me the whole time.
- Just ease up.

770
00:51:35,443 --> 00:51:38,485
Now go check the house again
and ask around about the dogs.

771
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,813
Yes, sir.

772
00:51:42,027 --> 00:51:43,140
You two.

773
00:51:43,694 --> 00:51:44,808
Home.

774
00:51:45,444 --> 00:51:46,606
Go, now!

775
00:51:51,486 --> 00:51:55,646
I think you should wear this.
Try not to laugh.

776
00:52:03,903 --> 00:52:06,612
Oddie, you are not responsible
for every death you can't prevent.

777
00:52:06,647 --> 00:52:07,493
She died.

778
00:52:07,528 --> 00:52:10,570
And if Fungus Bob was her killer,
I was either slow or stupid.

779
00:52:10,605 --> 00:52:11,661
Choose your weapon.

780
00:52:11,696 --> 00:52:13,452
Why would Fungus Bob kill Lysette?

781
00:52:13,487 --> 00:52:15,202
What's the connection?
It makes no sense.

782
00:52:15,237 --> 00:52:19,529
It doesn't have to make sense.
It just has to satisfy some sick urge.

783
00:52:19,564 --> 00:52:21,401
Maybe he's warming up.

784
00:52:22,112 --> 00:52:24,946
I think the chief just sent
some detectives to protect you.

785
00:52:24,981 --> 00:52:26,688
I don't need protecting.

786
00:52:27,862 --> 00:52:30,979
Actually I think it might
just be surveillance.

787
00:52:31,904 --> 00:52:33,245
Fungus Bob followed me
to the church.

788
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,863
I bet the chief is hoping
he'll sniff me out again.

789
00:52:35,898 --> 00:52:37,495
If the chief is using you as bait...

790
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:40,647
he should at least ask if
you mind having a hook in your ass.

791
00:52:45,988 --> 00:52:49,818
Oh, man, I got to stay focused.

792
00:52:51,905 --> 00:52:54,821
Good. You keep an eye on my girl.

793
00:52:55,989 --> 00:52:57,861
August 15th had begun.

794
00:52:58,281 --> 00:53:00,022
Time was running out.

795
00:53:47,033 --> 00:53:48,491
Hey, Bob.

796
00:53:49,617 --> 00:53:51,489
You're not planning
on getting up, are ya?

797
00:53:55,368 --> 00:53:57,026
But if you're dead...

798
00:53:57,451 --> 00:53:59,939
who's gonna massacre Pico Mundo?

799
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:03,693
Gun on the floor,
dead guy in my tub.

800
00:54:04,201 --> 00:54:06,488
I know a setup when I see one.

801
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:10,867
But if I call the police,
the chief will have to arrest me...

802
00:54:10,902 --> 00:54:14,200
and I won't be able to stop
the catastrophe from happening.

803
00:54:24,411 --> 00:54:26,042
Oh, my God!

804
00:54:26,077 --> 00:54:28,282
Oh, you are creeping me out.

805
00:54:42,744 --> 00:54:44,617
You're freezing cold, Bob.

806
00:54:45,454 --> 00:54:48,368
Your rigor mortis is way advanced.

807
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:51,611
You know...

808
00:54:51,828 --> 00:54:54,329
the chief said
you didn't leave any fingerprints.

809
00:54:54,364 --> 00:54:56,201
He didn't leave a single print.

810
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,279
And Stormy never actually saw you.

811
00:55:02,121 --> 00:55:03,495
- Come on!
- What?

812
00:55:07,455 --> 00:55:09,476
Because you were already dead.

813
00:55:09,511 --> 00:55:11,462
And the whole time in the church,

814
00:55:11,497 --> 00:55:14,163
you were actually
a pissed-off poltergeist.

815
00:55:14,198 --> 00:55:16,795
I think the last time
I saw Fungus Bob alive...

816
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:19,947
was when he left his house
right before I broke into it.

817
00:55:21,205 --> 00:55:25,205
He's been haunting me ever since,
blaming me for his death.

818
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:29,206
Why he blames me or who the hell
killed him is a little hazy.

819
00:55:29,241 --> 00:55:31,928
If I'm caught,
I'll either be arrested for murder

820
00:55:31,963 --> 00:55:34,616
or rolling what looks like
the biggest joint ever.

821
00:55:51,707 --> 00:55:53,697
It's just me, Rosalia!

822
00:56:06,916 --> 00:56:08,907
Damn it.

823
00:56:10,375 --> 00:56:12,744
Oh, give me a break.

824
00:56:14,417 --> 00:56:16,905
It's just me, again, Rosalia.

825
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:21,083
I'm gonna borrow
your car again, okay?

826
00:56:21,118 --> 00:56:22,424
If I'm being framed,

827
00:56:22,459 --> 00:56:25,309
why the police have failed
to arrive and arrest me...

828
00:56:25,344 --> 00:56:28,159
or the murderer hasn't come
to kill me, I do not know.

829
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:43,958
All right, Bob, where can I put you
to quietly decompose for a while...

830
00:56:43,993 --> 00:56:47,457
before someone finds you and has
a new love of Jesus scared into em?

831
00:57:06,211 --> 00:57:07,842
Interesting story, Bob.

832
00:57:07,877 --> 00:57:10,794
After the federal government
abandoned this prison...

833
00:57:10,829 --> 00:57:13,135
it went through a long
series of owners.

834
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:17,753
Rumor has it that at Von Zipper's
Burgers the fries were delicious...

835
00:57:17,788 --> 00:57:21,201
and the free-soft-drink-refill
policy was generously honored.

836
00:57:24,212 --> 00:57:26,677
And yet, this fine
dining establishment...

837
00:57:26,712 --> 00:57:31,504
never succeeded in winning
over the family-dining crowd...

838
00:57:31,539 --> 00:57:35,035
which is so essential
to any restaurant operation.

839
00:57:36,004 --> 00:57:38,136
Welcome to the gas chamber.

840
00:57:38,171 --> 00:57:39,837
A lot of people died in here, Bob.

841
00:57:39,872 --> 00:57:41,504
You should feeI right at home.

842
00:57:56,713 --> 00:58:00,464
Stormy's always joking about running
off to Las Vegas and getting married.

843
00:58:00,499 --> 00:58:03,506
But I tell her Vegas is packed
with dead people and bad guys...

844
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:06,504
and I'd just end up
fighting eviI 24-7.

845
00:58:08,714 --> 00:58:10,788
I should have listened to her.

846
00:58:13,507 --> 00:58:14,619
Too many.

847
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:17,748
Too many.

848
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:40,556
The chief.

849
00:58:40,591 --> 00:58:41,918
I need the chief.

850
00:58:44,008 --> 00:58:45,764
Dear Lord.

851
00:58:45,799 --> 00:58:49,331
If that's you again, Odd,
we are going to have words!

852
00:59:01,009 --> 00:59:03,083
Oh, my God.

853
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:12,984
No offense, Odd Thomas,
but I can't think of anybody...

854
00:59:13,019 --> 00:59:15,167
who could come in here right now
and not get my back up.

855
00:59:15,467 --> 00:59:17,822
- So you think he knew the shooter?
- Had to.

856
00:59:17,857 --> 00:59:20,177
Which means it's probably
somebody I know, too.

857
00:59:20,212 --> 00:59:22,665
- How bad is he?
- Bad.

858
00:59:24,219 --> 00:59:26,504
- Well, he's a fighter.
- He better be.

859
00:59:27,969 --> 00:59:29,946
- Hey, Bern.
- Ma'am.

860
00:59:29,981 --> 00:59:31,924
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

861
00:59:34,136 --> 00:59:36,706
- Hey.
- Oh Oddie.

862
00:59:36,927 --> 00:59:39,969
Keep those reporters out of here.
You, on that door.

863
00:59:40,004 --> 00:59:42,256
- Sorry, no press inside.
- Comin through.

864
00:59:45,387 --> 00:59:47,342
You saved his life, Oddie.

865
00:59:48,387 --> 00:59:50,176
Where's this bullet?

866
00:59:50,678 --> 00:59:53,381
That's the one they're
trying to dig out of him now.

867
00:59:57,137 --> 00:59:59,128
Time is up.

868
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:04,133
Pico Mundo is awakening
to a horror that only I can stop.

869
01:00:05,054 --> 01:00:07,304
Lysette and Fungus Bob are dead.

870
01:00:07,339 --> 01:00:09,519
The chief is
in the emergency room.

871
01:00:09,554 --> 01:00:12,470
There's hoards of bodachs
swarming all over town.

872
01:00:12,505 --> 01:00:14,186
Whatever's coming is gonna be big.

873
01:00:14,221 --> 01:00:16,894
I'm scared,
and I'm supposed to be fearless.

874
01:00:16,929 --> 01:00:19,117
- Don't tell me to stay home today.
- Please stay home today.

875
01:00:19,152 --> 01:00:21,305
- I will if you stay home with me.
- We've been through this.

876
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:23,805
I have to do
whatever I can to stop it.

877
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,770
Is Viola going to be shot dead?

878
01:00:25,805 --> 01:00:28,092
You know I don't know
that for sure.

879
01:00:28,513 --> 01:00:31,085
She's had it hard in life.
She doesn't need this.

880
01:00:31,722 --> 01:00:34,104
Shot dead? Really?
Who does need it?

881
01:00:34,139 --> 01:00:36,722
Oh, I don't know
why I try to reason with you.

882
01:00:36,757 --> 01:00:37,854
I always lose.

883
01:00:37,889 --> 01:00:39,910
You're a fabulous man of action,
odd one.

884
01:00:39,945 --> 01:00:41,931
You don't need to be
a good debater, too.

885
01:00:41,966 --> 01:00:43,687
Besides, you said yourself...

886
01:00:43,722 --> 01:00:46,431
any road I choose could lead me
right back to the same fate.

887
01:00:46,466 --> 01:00:48,598
So, which is it?
Do I have free will?

888
01:00:48,633 --> 01:00:50,257
Am I in God's hands?

889
01:00:51,098 --> 01:00:52,105
Or is it both?

890
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,431
Have I ever told you
you've got a lot of issues?

891
01:00:54,466 --> 01:00:56,189
I'm a woman. We all have issues.

892
01:00:56,224 --> 01:00:59,286
It's what keeps us interesting,
and you men interested.

893
01:00:59,321 --> 01:01:02,348
Oh, yeah? It's what makes us
crazy and die younger.

894
01:01:02,383 --> 01:01:03,592
Do you love me?

895
01:01:04,348 --> 01:01:06,515
I love you more than life itself.

896
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:09,347
See? It's working.

897
01:01:15,058 --> 01:01:17,891
Don't look back. Don't look back.

898
01:01:17,926 --> 01:01:19,135
Give him strength.

899
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,557
Knock, knock.

900
01:01:29,558 --> 01:01:32,342
I'm hoping Bob left
a clue on his computer.

901
01:01:33,184 --> 01:01:35,589
Something to lead me
to his partner...

902
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:40,059
to the person who was
planning on killing 100s,

903
01:01:40,094 --> 01:01:43,093
if not 1000s of people.

904
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,527
Hey.

905
01:02:44,562 --> 01:02:46,312
Loop me in, odd one.
Where are you?

906
01:02:46,347 --> 01:02:48,201
I'm walking towards the fridge.

907
01:02:48,235 --> 01:02:50,054
Yours, mine, or Fungus Bob's?

908
01:02:51,646 --> 01:02:53,153
Don't "uh-huh" me. I told you...

909
01:02:53,188 --> 01:02:55,896
you are not allowed to go playing
around in any more hell gates.

910
01:02:55,931 --> 01:02:57,472
Next!

911
01:02:57,771 --> 01:03:00,121
Oh, God. Cockroaches.

912
01:03:00,156 --> 01:03:02,470
Always cockroaches.

913
01:03:02,688 --> 01:03:05,064
- Odd Thomas, did you hear me?
- Which part?

914
01:03:05,099 --> 01:03:06,278
I can't believe
you went back there.

915
01:03:06,313 --> 01:03:09,644
Every time you don't listen to me,
you get yourself into trouble.

916
01:03:10,189 --> 01:03:13,519
- I wish I'd listened to you.
- You get out of there right now.

917
01:03:13,814 --> 01:03:16,729
Right, right. Leaving. Leaving.

918
01:03:19,773 --> 01:03:22,481
Never heard you make that
sound before. Is everything okay?

919
01:03:22,516 --> 01:03:26,309
- Yeah.
- What are you looking at?

920
01:03:27,898 --> 01:03:28,905
Fingers.

921
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:31,523
Please say they're attached
to someone's hand.

922
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:32,738
Sorry.

923
01:03:32,773 --> 01:03:33,989
Get out of there, Oddie.

924
01:03:34,024 --> 01:03:37,238
Someone has been buying
a lot of Burke and Bailey's.

925
01:03:37,273 --> 01:03:39,440
Yeah? Well, you tell whoever's
buying it that our ice cream...

926
01:03:39,475 --> 01:03:42,059
may be the best,
but it'll still melt in hell.

927
01:03:43,941 --> 01:03:45,691
- I'm calling the police.
- No.

928
01:03:45,726 --> 01:03:46,935
No. Wait.

929
01:03:47,149 --> 01:03:49,566
I'll leave here first.
Then I'll call 'em.

930
01:03:49,601 --> 01:03:50,976
Be careful.

931
01:03:51,011 --> 01:03:52,351
Don't worry.

932
01:03:59,983 --> 01:04:01,226
Hey, Bob.

933
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:05,657
I guess when I began to out you,
word somehow spread...

934
01:04:05,692 --> 01:04:11,108
and you became a liability to
your partner and he had to kill you.

935
01:04:11,525 --> 01:04:12,769
Sorry about that.

936
01:04:17,567 --> 01:04:22,275
I find it funny how I know more
about dead people than dead people.

937
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:23,366
This is our realm, Bob.

938
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:26,434
You can't physically harm
a living person.

939
01:04:30,902 --> 01:04:32,560
But there is that.

940
01:04:42,902 --> 01:04:45,473
Your call cannot be
completed as dialed.

941
01:04:54,152 --> 01:04:56,107
Gas.

942
01:05:24,571 --> 01:05:28,566
I'm exhausted, I'm lost,
and somewhere along the way...

943
01:05:28,601 --> 01:05:32,561
I missed an important clue
that could take me home.

944
01:05:37,488 --> 01:05:39,360
The bullet through the heart.

945
01:05:49,572 --> 01:05:51,859
It wasn't about the chief.

946
01:06:13,949 --> 01:06:16,235
God.

947
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:44,030
Enough already, Bob. Please.

948
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:50,278
My three least favorite words.

949
01:06:50,617 --> 01:06:52,359
Some..

950
01:06:54,784 --> 01:06:56,442
assembly...

951
01:06:56,659 --> 01:06:58,708
required.

952
01:06:58,743 --> 01:07:01,660
Simon, I've been dying to know
what that tattoo means.

953
01:07:01,695 --> 01:07:04,860
Let's just say this tattoo
is a crude obscenity.

954
01:07:06,952 --> 01:07:08,325
It's Varner.

955
01:07:09,034 --> 01:07:11,950
I once had a run-in with
some devil worshipers.

956
01:07:12,285 --> 01:07:13,743
I should've known.

957
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:19,125
P- O-D. Prince Of Darkness.

958
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,042
No wonder Varner was suspicious
when I told him...

959
01:07:22,077 --> 01:07:24,661
Fungus Bob had gotten aggressive
with me an hour earlier.

960
01:07:24,696 --> 01:07:27,908
This guy Bob Robertson
got aggressive with you?

961
01:07:28,119 --> 01:07:31,449
He had already killed Bob
5 or 6 hours before that.

962
01:07:31,745 --> 01:07:34,001
And that police van
protecting Stormy?

963
01:07:34,036 --> 01:07:36,328
That must've been Varner
waiting to follow me home...

964
01:07:36,363 --> 01:07:38,739
to bust me
for Fungus Bob's murder.

965
01:07:38,774 --> 01:07:41,114
Or shoot me while resisting arrest.

966
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:47,877
There were no bodachs around Varner.

967
01:07:47,912 --> 01:07:50,669
But I can still feel myself
being drawn to him...

968
01:07:50,704 --> 01:07:54,235
and to the place where
he's about to commit mass murder.

969
01:07:54,871 --> 01:07:56,244
GREEN MOON MALL

970
01:08:02,371 --> 01:08:04,575
Coconut cherry chocolate chunk.

971
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:07,153
Oh, God, no.

972
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:19,156
POLICE

973
01:08:20,205 --> 01:08:22,080
Hey, Nell,
I see what the problem is.

974
01:08:22,115 --> 01:08:22,962
Stormy.

975
01:08:22,997 --> 01:08:25,913
You are eating and
reading at the same time.

976
01:08:25,948 --> 01:08:27,904
How about I eat and you read?

977
01:08:28,831 --> 01:08:32,279
No? Not so good? Okay, fine.

978
01:08:46,665 --> 01:08:50,196
All right, Varner, where are you?

979
01:09:28,417 --> 01:09:30,622
SECURITY

980
01:09:41,543 --> 01:09:44,660
Fungus Bob didn't just
have one kill buddy.

981
01:09:45,627 --> 01:09:46,841
He had two.

982
01:09:46,876 --> 01:09:50,918
One more, and they could buy group
health insurance or form a rock band.

983
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:53,407
Officer Eckles is checking
that right now.

984
01:09:54,377 --> 01:09:56,252
I don't know what this
Odd Thomas character knows...

985
01:09:56,287 --> 01:09:57,936
but I know that Robertson
is stupid and careless...

986
01:09:57,971 --> 01:09:59,586
and he's gonna get us nailed
if we don't do something.

987
01:09:59,621 --> 01:10:00,467
Relax.

988
01:10:00,502 --> 01:10:03,835
Did Robertson ever find those
photos at the mall he misplaced?

989
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:08,328
I said, relax.
I'll take care of him.

990
01:10:19,794 --> 01:10:22,284
Stalking someone at the mall, Bern?

991
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,579
Robertson, that idiot.

992
01:10:27,087 --> 01:10:28,962
We got to make it
look like an accident.

993
01:10:28,997 --> 01:10:31,102
Oh, it'll look like
an accident all right.

994
01:10:31,137 --> 01:10:33,207
When I find Robertson,
I'm gonna kill him.

995
01:10:33,546 --> 01:10:35,702
Already been there, done that.

996
01:10:41,546 --> 01:10:44,879
Looks like their plan was to jump
out at the end of the mall disaster

997
01:10:44,914 --> 01:10:47,499
like heroes responding to the call.

998
01:10:48,338 --> 01:10:52,166
But I never saw any bodachs
around Eckles, either.

999
01:10:52,505 --> 01:10:56,501
The presence of the bodachs
tipped me off to Fungus Bob...

1000
01:10:56,536 --> 01:11:00,498
but not to his two co-conspirators,
which now seems...

1001
01:11:00,838 --> 01:11:02,346
intentional.

1002
01:11:02,381 --> 01:11:06,540
As if the bodachs knew of my gift,
as if they know I can see them.

1003
01:11:07,922 --> 01:11:10,494
The bodachs have been
manipulating me.

1004
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:34,046
I'm gonna finish you off,
old man.

1005
01:11:38,633 --> 01:11:39,847
Four.

1006
01:11:39,882 --> 01:11:42,169
Well, that's just jiffy.

1007
01:12:13,551 --> 01:12:16,667
This just so happens
to be my very favorite book.

1008
01:12:17,301 --> 01:12:19,458
The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz.

1009
01:12:19,676 --> 01:12:25,010
Officer Varner Prince of Darkness,
Officer Varner, Prince of Darkness.

1010
01:12:35,094 --> 01:12:36,255
Viola.

1011
01:12:36,469 --> 01:12:38,594
- Viola! What are you doing here?
- Odd! Geez!

1012
01:12:38,629 --> 01:12:40,684
- You scared the-
- What are you doing here?

1013
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:42,656
We had to pick out
a birthday present for Levanna.

1014
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:45,142
And Nicolina wanted to get
a card for her big sister.

1015
01:12:45,177 --> 01:12:47,593
Look, your dream, it's happening
right here, right now.

1016
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:50,990
I thought in a big stadium or
at the water park or a bowling alley.

1017
01:12:51,025 --> 01:12:53,761
Ladies, I need you to take Viola
and get her out of here, okay?

1018
01:12:53,796 --> 01:12:56,464
Come on.
Come on, come on. Go on.

1019
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:59,561
This made Dorothy so very angry...

1020
01:12:59,596 --> 01:13:01,887
that she picked up the bucket
of water that stood near...

1021
01:13:01,922 --> 01:13:04,590
and dashed it all over
the wicked witch.

1022
01:13:05,512 --> 01:13:08,006
And then the wicked witch said...

1023
01:13:08,041 --> 01:13:10,502
"I'm melting! I'm melting!"

1024
01:13:13,346 --> 01:13:15,917
There's suddenly lots
of flashing lights.

1025
01:13:16,263 --> 01:13:18,833
With old-fashioned kiddie music.

1026
01:13:21,055 --> 01:13:23,010
And then I hear a big crowd.

1027
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:28,630
And then there's the sound of water,
gushing water.

1028
01:13:32,097 --> 01:13:33,758
Bye, Nell.

1029
01:13:33,793 --> 01:13:35,421
Bye, Stormy.

1030
01:13:37,722 --> 01:13:39,597
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry!

1031
01:13:39,632 --> 01:13:41,138
Move, move. Excuse me!

1032
01:14:29,475 --> 01:14:32,177
A gun! He's got a gun!

1033
01:15:25,228 --> 01:15:28,759
Stormy and I are destined
to be together forever.

1034
01:15:29,603 --> 01:15:33,549
Gypsy Mummy gave us a card that
said so, for a single quarter...

1035
01:15:34,187 --> 01:15:36,675
what other couples couldn't
buy at any price.

1036
01:15:40,728 --> 01:15:42,388
No!

1037
01:16:06,272 --> 01:16:08,760
Get out of the way! Get off!

1038
01:17:11,567 --> 01:17:13,024
Hi.

1039
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,728
Odd!

1040
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:34,687
Odd!

1041
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:37,728
It's not over.

1042
01:17:44,194 --> 01:17:45,520
It's not over.

1043
01:17:46,152 --> 01:17:48,771
It's not over. It's not over.

1044
01:17:51,694 --> 01:17:54,069
Hey Chief. What's with
the guy who shot the dogs?

1045
01:17:54,104 --> 01:17:56,355
His names Kevin Goss.

1046
01:17:56,778 --> 01:17:58,653
One of these days, bang!

1047
01:17:58,688 --> 01:17:59,814
You hear me?

1048
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:24,485
He's got a gun!

1049
01:18:39,405 --> 01:18:41,037
- Is this your truck?
- I need a drill!

1050
01:18:41,072 --> 01:18:42,884
Do you have a drill?
I need to get this open!

1051
01:18:42,919 --> 01:18:44,662
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a cop. Now look!

1052
01:18:44,697 --> 01:18:46,780
You see that woman?
Some maniacs just shot up the mall!

1053
01:18:46,815 --> 01:18:49,072
So either get with me,
get behind me, or get out!

1054
01:18:49,107 --> 01:18:50,648
I got a grinder!

1055
01:19:02,322 --> 01:19:04,812
Oh, my God.

1056
01:19:20,866 --> 01:19:23,782
Everyone get the hell out of here!
Get the hell out!

1057
01:19:23,817 --> 01:19:24,896
Now!

1058
01:20:12,119 --> 01:20:13,231
Hey!

1059
01:20:34,286 --> 01:20:35,530
Shit!

1060
01:20:45,245 --> 01:20:47,947
You really set yourself up, asshole!

1061
01:21:27,122 --> 01:21:29,825
It's cold in the desert.

1062
01:22:16,083 --> 01:22:19,416
I could tell my stuffing
wasn't entirely intact.

1063
01:22:19,451 --> 01:22:21,340
He's awake. He's awake!

1064
01:22:21,375 --> 01:22:24,207
But it was nothing
they couldn't stitch back together.

1065
01:22:31,083 --> 01:22:33,793
Karla told me that the chief
had come through just fine...

1066
01:22:33,828 --> 01:22:36,466
and somehow managed
to spin Fungus Bob's corpse...

1067
01:22:36,501 --> 01:22:40,115
into a bizarre cover story
that kept my secret a secret.

1068
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:47,300
An FBI expert
on television said that

1069
01:22:47,335 --> 01:22:50,251
if you hadn't gotten
those explosives out of there,

1070
01:22:50,286 --> 01:22:53,133
at least 500 or 600 people
would've died, for sure.

1071
01:22:53,168 --> 01:22:57,114
They told me events at the Green Moon
Mall had made headlines everywhere.

1072
01:22:58,168 --> 01:23:00,658
But I didn't want to read
or see anything about it.

1073
01:23:02,335 --> 01:23:03,217
According to Eckles...

1074
01:23:03,252 --> 01:23:06,440
he and Varner started a satanic
cult when they were teenagers.

1075
01:23:06,475 --> 01:23:09,628
One night, they killed a man
and realized they enjoyed it.

1076
01:23:09,663 --> 01:23:10,927
So they kept at it,

1077
01:23:10,962 --> 01:23:13,876
eventually joining
the police force for better cover.

1078
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:18,103
They met Robertson and Goss
and came up with a plan...

1079
01:23:18,138 --> 01:23:21,287
to infiltrate a small town
and then slowly kill it.

1080
01:23:32,754 --> 01:23:34,177
Odd! Odd! Odd!

1081
01:23:34,212 --> 01:23:36,701
Detail, present arms.

1082
01:23:37,546 --> 01:23:38,427
ODD SAVES

1083
01:23:38,462 --> 01:23:39,629
MARRY ME ODD!
ODD WORLD

1084
01:23:39,664 --> 01:23:41,786
IN ODD WE TRUST

1085
01:24:02,547 --> 01:24:03,554
When I'm with you,

1086
01:24:03,589 --> 01:24:07,334
I don't have to worry about
pancakes or poltergeists.

1087
01:24:08,381 --> 01:24:11,711
When I'm with you,
I'm with my destiny.

1088
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:16,162
Where you live, I flourish.

1089
01:24:21,173 --> 01:24:23,662
We ate food that wasn't healthy.

1090
01:24:26,382 --> 01:24:28,871
We drank too much...

1091
01:24:30,549 --> 01:24:32,207
and slept too much...

1092
01:24:38,674 --> 01:24:41,507
but could never kiss enough.

1093
01:24:42,216 --> 01:24:45,048
Everything was just as I wished.

1094
01:24:49,508 --> 01:24:53,668
- Yeah?
- Odd, it's us. Open up.

1095
01:24:55,258 --> 01:24:57,592
- Hey, guys.
- We have been calling you, Oddie.

1096
01:24:57,627 --> 01:24:59,891
I know. You know,
I disconnected the phone...

1097
01:24:59,925 --> 01:25:02,217
because the reporters won't
leave me and Stormy alone.

1098
01:25:02,252 --> 01:25:04,006
- Son.
- Do you want some-

1099
01:25:06,509 --> 01:25:08,797
You've been here long enough.

1100
01:25:08,832 --> 01:25:11,084
We think it's time to stop.

1101
01:25:11,593 --> 01:25:16,499
Sweetheart, the coroner finally
released her poor body.

1102
01:25:33,885 --> 01:25:35,675
A part of me knew...

1103
01:25:36,302 --> 01:25:39,834
from the moment I saw her
behind the ice cream counter.

1104
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:43,385
But the truth hurt
too much to accept.

1105
01:25:44,511 --> 01:25:47,842
Her death would have been
one wound too many that day.

1106
01:25:49,011 --> 01:25:52,543
And I think I would have
let go of this life.

1107
01:26:04,429 --> 01:26:06,384
She's here, isn't she?

1108
01:26:13,596 --> 01:26:15,254
You got to let her go.

1109
01:26:16,513 --> 01:26:19,427
She deserves to move
to her next life.

1110
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:22,006
Son...

1111
01:26:24,013 --> 01:26:25,554
it's just time.

1112
01:27:22,141 --> 01:27:23,599
I love you.

1113
01:27:26,183 --> 01:27:30,343
I promise I will see you again.
Okay?

1114
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:43,575
YOU ARE NOW LEAVING PICO MUNDO
COME BACK AGAIN SOON

1115
01:28:50,563 --> 01:28:53,605
Stormy always believed that life
is not about how fast you run...

1116
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,760
or with what degree of grace.

1117
01:28:56,313 --> 01:28:58,361
That this life is a boot camp,

1118
01:28:58,396 --> 01:29:00,936
that we must persevere
through all the obstacles

1119
01:29:00,971 --> 01:29:03,478
and hardships to earn our way
into the next life.

1120
01:29:04,522 --> 01:29:07,768
To be with her again, I will have
the perseverance of a bulldog.

1121
01:29:09,230 --> 01:29:12,347
But sometimes, it seems to me...

1122
01:29:13,189 --> 01:29:16,306
the training
is unnecessarily painful.

1123
01:29:23,606 --> 01:29:25,654
If I live an average life-span...

1124
01:29:25,689 --> 01:29:29,020
I'll have another 60 years
before I see Stormy again.

1125
01:29:29,523 --> 01:29:31,313
That will be a long wait.

1126
01:29:33,398 --> 01:29:35,354
But I am a patient man.

1127
01:29:37,773 --> 01:29:40,060
And I have much to do.

1128
01:29:41,168 --> 01:29:46,718
