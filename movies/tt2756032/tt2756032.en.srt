00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:22,029
<i>So we met at a party,
and it was magic.</i>

3
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,639
<i>Within a half hour,</i>

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,479
<i>we were driving up into this
really nice neighborhood,</i>

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,399
<i>and we were running down the
stairs of some stranger's backyard,</i>

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:41,863
<i>and then we were swimming
and we were in love.</i>

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,319
<i>What we didn't count on was that
even though the lights were off,</i>

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,039
<i>the owner of the home was there,</i>

9
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,199
<i>and he came out screaming at us,</i>

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,359
<i>and it was the greatest
night of my life.</i>

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,100
Ready?

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,239
So my idea was, you know,

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,870
let's try and re-create that moment.

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,839
Oh, it's freezing!

15
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,389
It's a little colder
than I remember it.

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,879
Do you think he's coming out?

17
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,719
I'm sure. I'm sure
he heard us, right?

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,622
Hello? This is fun.

19
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,439
Yeah.

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,101
Where is he?

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,225
Maybe he's not home.

22
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,279
Happy anniversary anyway.

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,384
Happy anniversary.

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,799
<i>When we were in the water
and we were waiting</i>

25
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,599
<i>and no one came out, no one was home,</i>

26
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,399
<i>and we were just floating there,</i>

27
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,187
<i>I felt sad,</i>

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,319
and I felt like our happiness
used to be so easy

29
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,599
and there used to be so much of it,

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,319
and now I feel like
happiness is something

31
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,948
that we have to re-create.

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,781
Ah.

33
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,039
I'm sorry. I tried to
make a romantic moment.

34
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,759
I'll never take you to
a fucking pool again.

35
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,308
Oh, come on. Don't do that.

36
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,679
Okay.

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,839
This could be fun.

38
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,559
We're going to do a
compatibility exercise.

39
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,679
I want you both to play a
note at the same time, okay?

40
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,839
Just any note?

41
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,342
Yep. Knock yourself out.

42
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,559
Wow! You guys are
not in sync, are you?

43
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,799
We used to be great.

44
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,239
We used to be really
irreverent and...

45
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,359
Yeah. There was teasing.

46
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,519
- Yeah.
- And stuff. Like I...

47
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,799
I mean no offense...

48
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,399
But I would call you a
bitch and it was funny.

49
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,519
Yeah, it was hilarious.

50
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,639
I used to call you a bitch.

51
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,479
- You thought it was really funny.
- Yeah.

52
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,679
I just don't know how we're
going to move forward

53
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,799
if we keep having this
circular conversation

54
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,759
about me doing what I did

55
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,679
which I have apologized for already,

56
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,439
and we are here because
we are trying to move on.

57
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,719
I don't see why we have
to keep revisiting that

58
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,999
because it's the same
conversation over and over again.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,639
Because you don't get
to decide that, Ethan.

60
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,839
You don't get to decide
when we move on, I do.

61
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,547
30, you guys having sex?

62
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,359
Now if you'd played
this one, Sophie...

63
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,719
or that one...
that's pretty, right?

64
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,224
But this... not so much.

65
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,519
Anyway, it's just an exercise.

66
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,359
I want to trust you again.

67
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,599
I want to forgive you.

68
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,839
I want all of those things.

69
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,799
I want us and I want us to work.

70
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,639
I don't know why you feel
like I don't want that.

71
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,711
Because we don't agree on
how we're going to get there.

72
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,791
Where are you?

73
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,959
Okay.

74
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,759
I have an idea.

75
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,039
This is a great place.

76
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,622
I think it will be very helpful.

77
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,039
It's absolutely beautiful.

78
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,679
<i>It's about an hour and
a half north from here.</i>

79
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,439
<i>It's like a... like
a perfect retreat,</i>

80
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,919
<i>just the two of you.</i>

81
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,479
<i>Give you a chance to
reset the reset button.</i>

82
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,879
<i>I've sent a lot of couples there,</i>

83
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,039
and they've all come back

84
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,780
renewed.

85
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,111
- What do you think?
- I mean, I'll try anything.

86
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,301
Sophie?

87
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,861
Wow!

88
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,581
Hello?

89
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,039
And then when you
pour the wine, you do this.

90
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,479
This is what they do in
the restaurants. Watch this. Whoop.

91
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,079
So it doesn't drip.
Even though I kind of...

92
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,999
- It kind of dripped.
- I don't think you did it right.

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,199
Cheers!

94
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,639
To me and my cooking.

95
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,239
There's a guest house on the
property which is pretty cool.

96
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,359
- Really?
- Yeah.

97
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,919
I don't even know if
we're supposed to use it

98
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,599
or if someone else is renting it.

99
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,519
Oh, God. What's happening?

100
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,199
Come here. Come here.

101
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,940
What's happening?

102
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,221
Whoa!

103
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,719
Yeah, yeah.

104
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,999
You've got to hold it.

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,821
Hold it in, hold it in.

106
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,199
There you go.

107
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,039
- Geez.
- Wow, still got it.

108
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,479
Get the light going.

109
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,839
- Sweetie.
- Sorry, sorry.

110
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,865
Give me kiss.

111
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,959
Aw! You're so cute
without your glasses.

112
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,759
You shouldn't wear these.
I like you without them.

113
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,959
Do you like me without the glasses?

114
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,586
Should I wear them?

115
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,020
Get over here!

116
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,799
You found me.

117
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,825
I found you.

118
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,239
Hey.

119
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,399
Hey there.

120
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,759
Hey, you know, you were right.

121
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,879
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

122
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,119
Do tell.

123
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,624
We need to try more new things,

124
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,519
like weekends away
in places like this.

125
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,829
- You think so?
- Mmm-hmm.

126
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,759
It makes me excited about us again.

127
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,959
Do you feel it?

128
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,541
- I do.
- Yeah.

129
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,519
I love you.

130
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,431
I love you.

131
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,519
And here it comes.

132
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,079
- Aw.
- Oh!

133
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,879
- Close!
- The bounce. It's okay.

134
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,639
- Okay, wait. Your turn.
- Okay.

135
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,399
- Oh, under.
- Under. Okay.

136
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,799
Under and in.

137
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,919
Oh, shit!

138
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,719
Oh, you got it. Oh, my God!

139
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,919
Of course I got it.

140
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,831
- Ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

141
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,359
This is your grape.

142
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,021
Hi.

143
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,879
Come here, come here.

144
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,999
What?

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,547
Come here.

146
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,439
That was awesome!

147
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,839
I knew you could do it.

148
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,759
Do you want to sleep here tonight?

149
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,879
Can we?

150
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,159
Sure. We can do whatever we want.

151
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,319
Okay. Yep.

152
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,479
Let me just get some clothes.

153
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,679
I don't want to sleep in my jeans.

154
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,919
- Okay.
- You want anything?

155
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,199
I'm good.

156
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,439
I love you, hon.

157
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,559
I'll be right here.

158
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,300
Okay.

159
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,319
Ha-ha! You're asleep.

160
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,026
Very funny.

161
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,589
You did it. You got your joke.

162
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,626
Ethan.

163
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,060
Ethan.

164
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,399
Stop it.

165
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,519
Stop it. I laughed. It's over now.

166
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,159
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

167
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,919
How did you get up here so fast?

168
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,230
Did you find a secret passageway?

169
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,823
Yeah, secret underground passage.

170
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,270
- Wow!
- Mmm-hmm.

171
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,079
So mysterious.

172
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,079
No, seriously.
How did you get here so fast?

173
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,786
You beat me.

174
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,599
What?

175
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,229
How did you get here from
the guest house before me?

176
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,119
You mean, before dinner?

177
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,319
I was just walking outside
and I just walked over.

178
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,079
No, not before dinner, just now.

179
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,839
Why are you so sweaty?

180
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,159
Did you go for a run or something?

181
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,679
Oh, yeah.

182
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,786
Because... Is that the joke
that's happening now?

183
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,279
What?

184
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,199
The joke that you're
not going to remember

185
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,959
that we just had sex,
because that's really funny.

186
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,879
Wait!

187
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,745
We just had sex?

188
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,559
Okay. That's not funny.

189
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,639
I'm not trying to be funny.

190
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,199
I thought you were making a joke.

191
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,559
- Why are you doing this right now?
- I'm not doing anything.

192
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,879
I've...

193
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,381
Huh?

194
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,799
You know what, Ethan?

195
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,359
You just had a really nice night and
I don't know why you would ruin it.

196
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,639
I'm not trying to ruin our night.
I want to have a nice night.

197
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,799
Fine, we had sex. It was great.

198
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,870
You were amazing.

199
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,066
You're an asshole.

200
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,180
Good night.

201
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,621
I'm sorry.

202
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,119
I love you.

203
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,145
I love you.

204
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,381
Hey.

205
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,750
Good morning, handsome.

206
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,079
Oh! I'm hungover.

207
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,871
Well, it sounds like you
need some breakfast.

208
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,559
Not that we need to
get back into it. Um...

209
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,879
But that was a little bit of
a weird fight last night.

210
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,999
I know.

211
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,439
I don't really understand what
happened, but I feel like

212
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,399
maybe we just chalk it up
to like some bad pot...

213
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,319
Alcohol combo, put it behind us

214
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,599
and not let it ruin the trip.

215
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,079
Agreed, totally.

216
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,741
Cool.

217
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,839
That being said,

218
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,119
it was one of the weirder
fights we've had. Like...

219
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,559
Oh my God, I know.

220
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,679
Crazy, right?

221
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,639
I mean, I still don't
fully understand

222
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,439
whether you were so drunk and stoned

223
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,759
that you thought we had sex

224
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,439
or were you just were making
a joke and it backfired.

225
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,559
Honestly, I think it was just
one of those things, you know?

226
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,759
One of those things...
No, I'm asking you

227
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,199
was it that you were drunk and stoned

228
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,439
or was it playing a joke...

229
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,879
Because I'm still confused
what happened.

230
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,559
I think the important
thing is that, you know,

231
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,079
we fought, we made up, we had
a nice cuddle, beautiful day.

232
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,439
Sophie, what are you talking about?

233
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,839
We had a fight and you stormed out.

234
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,999
We didn't make up.

235
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,865
Are you okay?

236
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,559
I'm fine, are you okay? I'm...

237
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,079
Okay, Mr. Hangover.

238
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,599
I think it's time for some food. Huh?

239
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,719
Let's get something in your stomach.

240
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,879
You're kind of freaking me
out a little bit, Sophie.

241
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,359
I've got to say... Is that bacon?

242
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,021
Yeah.

243
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,187
You hate it when I eat bacon.

244
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,460
What?

245
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,439
What's going on?

246
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,559
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

247
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,222
I don't understand why
you're doing this.

248
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,319
No.

249
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,839
No, no, no, no.

250
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,079
No what?

251
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,479
This was...
There were plates... Hello?

252
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,679
What are you talking about plates?

253
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,959
Hello, hello? What are you... Ethan?

254
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,839
- Where'd you go?
- Where'd who go?

255
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,546
Ethan?

256
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,719
Hello?

257
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,119
Ethan?

258
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,759
There was bacon right
there on those plates...

259
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,839
What are you talking about?
Ethan, answer me.

260
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,079
You can't... The smell of bacon...

261
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,079
You can't get the smell of
bacon out in five minutes.

262
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,479
- There was bacon...
- What about bacon?

263
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,919
Right here. There was bacon here.

264
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,991
Why are you acting like this?

265
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,559
Shit. Sophie, Sophie.

266
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,079
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

267
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,359
Sophie, Sophie...

268
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,479
- What?
- I'm sorry.

269
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,759
- What?
- I'm sorry, just wait.

270
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,319
I'm spazzing out in there, I know,

271
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,079
but something fucking weird

272
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,359
like Twilight Zone
shit is going on here,

273
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,022
and I'm trying to get
a handle on it, okay?

274
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,599
Last night we had a nice dinner.

275
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,039
We had a blast together, right?

276
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,159
- Yes.
- Okay.

277
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,799
Then, we smoked some pot.

278
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,679
I fell asleep on the couch.

279
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,559
Next thing I know, you woke me up

280
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,599
claiming that we had
just had sex together.

281
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,511
Because we did!

282
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,119
Okay. I came here.

283
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,199
Nobody was here.

284
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,439
I fell asleep on this couch

285
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,599
and I woke up to you snuggling me.

286
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,919
What? What are you talking about?

287
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,199
No, I didn't.

288
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,959
That's crazy to me that you
would deny that, okay?

289
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,639
- I didn't.
- Exactly.

290
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,599
Crazy just like me denying
that I had slept with you.

291
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,559
You know what I'm saying?

292
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,319
We had two completely separate
experiences with each other

293
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,630
that neither of us remembers, and...

294
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,879
Hang on a second. I'm going to
go in there by myself, okay?

295
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,999
Why?

296
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,399
You just stay here
for like 30 seconds.

297
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,061
- Don't move.
- Ethan!

298
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,426
Hello?

299
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,421
Hey, Babe.

300
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,269
Can you hand me a towel?

301
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,159
You're in that shower.

302
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,839
I just handed you a towel.

303
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,399
Okay, you know what,
I'm not even mad any more.

304
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,999
Now you're just scaring me,

305
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,799
and I don't understand
why you're doing this.

306
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,189
Go, go see for yourself, Sophie.

307
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,780
Be careful.

308
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,064
Hey, where you been all morning?

309
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,711
Hello, Sophie.

310
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,399
I was just walking.

311
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,479
Oh, yeah.

312
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,279
It's really nice out, huh?

313
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,519
It's actually a little bright in here.
Do you mind if I close these?

314
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,021
Mmm-mmm.

315
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,919
The morning sun here is insane.

316
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,104
Give me a hug.

317
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,665
Sorry. I'm a little sweaty.

318
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,271
That's okay.

319
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,860
Come on.

320
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,021
Sophie.

321
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,746
Soph?

322
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,426
Fuck this.

323
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,580
You're kidding me!

324
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,421
What the fuck?

325
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,479
Sophie?

326
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,029
Oh my God! Hey, are you okay?

327
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,065
You're in there. It's you.

328
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,039
You're exercising.

329
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,559
What is happening?

330
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,505
I don't know.

331
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,746
This is so crazy.

332
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,479
Did that really happen?

333
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,159
I mean, did that, was that...

334
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,799
I just don't... I don't understand.

335
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,519
Is it another dimension, like
when you go through the door,

336
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,119
is it another plane
of existence or...

337
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,399
I don't know.

338
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,559
I've no clue.

339
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,479
I think we need to just say
some weird shit happened.

340
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,839
We compartmentalize it.

341
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,359
There was a cosmic
aberration of some sort...

342
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,879
- Yeah, yeah. Move on.
- And we go home.

343
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,519
We don't talk about this again,
and we just stop thinking about it.

344
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,079
Okay.

345
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,947
- Yeah. We could move on.
- Done.

346
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,701
Oh my God, I can't stop
thinking about it.

347
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,866
Can you?

348
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,159
We're just going to have to just...

349
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,839
I guess time, you know...

350
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,559
I'm not going to be able to stop
thinking about this, Ethan.

351
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,959
Well, what else can we do?

352
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,303
I mean what are we, what are
we going to do, you know?

353
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,981
Well, I mean, there's the...

354
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,959
There's the crazy thing
to do which is...

355
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,507
What?

356
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,791
Which is to, you know,
explore it further.

357
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,599
Explore it further?

358
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,199
I know you only had
a little bit of it...

359
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,879
Yeah. I was there for
like three seconds.

360
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,999
I know. And I, but I
had a whole evening...

361
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,639
In that house, and I have to say,

362
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,119
I know I sound like a
crazy person right now,

363
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,359
but I have to say it
was kind of magical.

364
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,639
- Well...
- It was...

365
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,439
But don't go overboard
with the whole magic

366
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,679
of what happened there

367
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,199
because I know what
you did in there, okay?

368
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,799
All right. That's not
what I'm talking about.

369
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,319
I'm not talking about
that kind of magic.

370
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,799
There was a rush.

371
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,959
It was exciting. I felt happy.

372
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,119
And it wasn't just that.

373
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,599
It wasn't just the time
in the guest house.

374
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,439
We had a great time
in the main house.

375
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,239
Yes, we did. We had a good time.

376
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,679
It wasn't just the weed.

377
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,759
I mean we were connecting,
we were talking,

378
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,599
we were happy, we were... Happy.

379
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,759
Yes.

380
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,359
We also had a fantastic time when
we did ecstasy at Lalapalooza,

381
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,319
but we're not going to do that every
day of our lives because you die...

382
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,479
- Right.
- Okay?

383
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,959
There's a question
of our safety here.

384
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,759
Yeah. But I didn't feel
like it was dangerous.

385
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,467
I didn't feel... I felt safe.

386
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,279
I didn't feel dangerous, either.

387
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,559
I felt like I was with you.

388
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,519
This is something that we've
been talking about in therapy...

389
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,719
Exploring new options,
creating a new relationship...

390
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,959
Not going back to the past

391
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,239
and re-creating old
things that happened

392
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,079
but starting with new things.

393
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,559
Yeah. Point taken.

394
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,679
I know that this is...

395
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,119
I didn't imagine this sort of...

396
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,319
- ...extreme.
- ...new thing.

397
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,439
Absolutely, but...

398
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,599
I imagined like horseback riding

399
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,439
with a little satchel
of wine, you know?

400
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,159
Not exploring other dimensions

401
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,999
in some weird version of
<i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i>

402
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,821
What if this is something
that I want to do?

403
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,479
You want to go back?

404
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,221
I want to help our relationship.

405
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,719
So... A little weird to say this,

406
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,559
but I'm struggling a
little bit with the fact

407
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,906
that you slept with the
other me last night.

408
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,599
Yeah, but I thought it was you.

409
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,239
I know. I'm not mad or blaming you.

410
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,599
I just like...
I'd be lying if I, you know,

411
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,639
didn't say I was a
little jealous, I guess.

412
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,319
All right. I understand,

413
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,222
but obviously I would never
knowingly cheat on you.

414
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,719
So it seems like it only works
if we go in one at a time.

415
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,839
Correct.

416
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,025
So I guess we'll just figure out
who wants to go in there first.

417
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,108
I'll be out in a minute, sweetheart.

418
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,946
Okay, I'm here.

419
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,701
That's good.

420
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,799
Hey, is that bacon okay?

421
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,999
It's been sitting out for awhile.

422
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,661
It's good.

423
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,039
Good.

424
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,429
Where have you been all morning?

425
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,541
Hanging out, you know.

426
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,786
Cool.

427
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,981
I missed you.

428
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,159
You missed me?

429
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,821
Of course.

430
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,466
Come sit with me.

431
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,350
Okay.

432
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,746
So...

433
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,879
So...

434
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,279
Isn't it crazy to think that
we're actually married?

435
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,706
I guess so.

436
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,839
We are husband and wife.

437
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,079
- I know.
- Yeah.

438
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,820
I love it.

439
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,279
How long have you been
here, by the way?

440
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,799
Since we came yesterday, silly.

441
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,599
No, I mean, in the guest house.

442
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,909
Since we slept here last night.

443
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,439
Uh-oh. Someone's in detective mode.

444
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,719
Sorry. I didn't mean to be.

445
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,063
That's okay. I don't mind.

446
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,559
Have you explored the
grounds very much?

447
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,903
I think I have a pretty
good sense of it.

448
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,879
It's so pretty here, isn't it?

449
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,399
It is. Would you like to
go on a walk with me?

450
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,399
Not really right now, but you're
welcome to go on a walk.

451
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,470
It's your vacation, too.

452
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,341
Okay.

453
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,279
I'll see you in a little bit, Sophie.

454
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,862
Okay, Ethan.

455
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,941
Whoa!

456
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,919
- Fascinating.
- Tell me.

457
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,399
Okay. That being in there is
100% convinced that she is you.

458
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,559
- She is?
- Yeah.

459
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,119
I threw out some soft challenges.

460
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,759
She is unflappable.

461
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,839
I think when you go in there...

462
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,959
God, it's crazy.

463
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,839
Yeah, you throw out some
like very specific examples

464
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,519
from our past and see how he reacts.

465
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,599
Oh, no, no, sweetie.

466
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,319
I don't think we're
supposed to challenge them.

467
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,279
What if they disappear
or something, you know?

468
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,359
What if they freak out?
I'm just saying what's the harm

469
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,999
in letting them think
that they're us?

470
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,519
Yeah, I mean, I... All right.

471
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,079
There's no harm in it.

472
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,879
I just thought part
of the fun of this

473
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,159
was like the investigation
and trying to...

474
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,519
I know. Of course you thought

475
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,119
the fun was in the investigation.

476
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,359
Wait, hold on.

477
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,199
It's like at the magic show in Vegas
when you told me how the magician

478
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,479
did every single trick

479
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,599
and you ruined the entire show
for me and everyone around us.

480
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,719
Okay. You remember we
talked about the magic show

481
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,719
was three years ago and
we're moving past that?

482
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,319
- Okay.
- Yeah.

483
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,799
Let's go inside.

484
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,359
We'll make up some
ground rules together.

485
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,919
That way neither of us
feels like, you know,

486
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,199
there's any kind of...

487
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,279
Confusion.

488
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,119
- Or just being on the same page.
- Okay.

489
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,719
While we are in the guest house

490
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,159
with the weird people,
no intimacy, no sex.

491
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,919
Yes. Absolutely agreed.

492
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,239
- No sex.
- Good.

493
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,319
What else?

494
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,159
Well, I would say that
would lead me to,

495
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,159
you know, no spying and there
has to be trust involved,

496
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,119
and we'll be honest with each
other about what happens

497
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,439
in the guest house and...

498
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,719
Right. It's like a...

499
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,279
It's like a therapy
exercise in trust almost.

500
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,599
- It's a trust exercise.
- Okay, great.

501
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,839
- That's why we're here.
- Good.

502
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,341
Um...

503
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,239
Let's see.

504
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,599
I guess if there's anything else...

505
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,559
Actually this is kind
of really important

506
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,999
now that I think about it.

507
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,719
We can have fun with this,
but if at any point either of us

508
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,079
becomes uncomfortable
and wants to stop,

509
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,439
we just cut it off, pack our bags...

510
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,559
Absolutely.

511
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,919
Absolutely. Agreed.

512
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,479
That's a good one,
that's a really good one.

513
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,061
Yeah.

514
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,261
Anything else?

515
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,759
I think that's it.

516
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,199
Then we are done. Those are good.

517
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,999
So since we're just kind of
like dipping our toes in here,

518
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,039
I think maybe we shouldn't
spend too much time in there

519
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,119
the first go-around.

520
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,668
Okay. How does 15 minutes sound?

521
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,919
Yeah, I think that's good.

522
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,959
Okay, but don't, you know,
stand outside waiting for me.

523
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,519
Wait, what?

524
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,399
Well, you know, I think it's
going to make me nervous

525
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,823
if I think you're waiting
right outside the door.

526
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,065
Yeah, okay. That's fair.

527
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,159
Oh, you mean, like right now?

528
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,159
- Yeah. Yeah, okay.
- Yes, sorry.

529
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,071
- Okay. Go ahead.
- Okay.

530
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,140
Enjoy yourself, but be safe.

531
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,461
Hey.

532
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,826
It's nice.

533
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,959
You could be honest.

534
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,399
I handle the criticism.

535
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,504
No, it's...

536
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,140
Okay.

537
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,022
I think I look a little severe.

538
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,025
Is that how you see me?

539
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,679
No.

540
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,079
I'm just not a very good painter.

541
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,627
No.

542
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,119
I was trying to emulate Degas

543
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,039
who lights up his portrait faces
with all these wonderful colors.

544
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,199
Degas?

545
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,279
Unfortunately, it looks like
your face was lit on fire...

546
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,079
Which was not my intention.
I apologize.

547
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,159
But it yielded a
wonderful title, though.

548
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,719
- Uh-huh.
- I'm thinking of calling it

549
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,359
"Sophie My Love, the Burn Victim."

550
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,239
Or the ultimate tittle "Sophie
My Love, the Full-On Bitch"

551
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,039
because I look awfully bitchy.

552
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,239
- Well...
- Sorry.

553
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,107
Well, in all fairness,
sometimes you're a bitch.

554
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,519
Excuse me?

555
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,679
Yeah, but it's cool

556
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,719
because I'm an asshole
sometimes, you know?

557
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,959
Right.

558
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,599
We can say that, right?

559
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,829
No, I think it's good.

560
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,386
- Scoot over.
- Thanks.

561
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,304
Okay.

562
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,741
Cheers.

563
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,945
- Cheers.
- To a perfect weekend together.

564
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,141
Hmm.

565
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,345
That's very nice.

566
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,119
Where you going?

567
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,066
Nowhere but here.

568
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,599
Why are you nervous?

569
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,079
I'm not nervous.

570
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,879
Why do you think I'm nervous?

571
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,799
Give me your hand.

572
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,301
Hmm?

573
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,710
What? Don't you trust me?

574
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,781
What the fuck?

575
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,559
You were spying on me.

576
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,839
Well, yeah. You were like
over 20 minutes in there.

577
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,839
Over 20... We didn't agree it
would be exactly 15 minutes,

578
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,959
- five minutes over?
- Yeah, but you know,

579
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,239
we didn't agree on like
intimate massages either.

580
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,999
Wait, wait. Intimate,
intimate massages?

581
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,199
- Are you serious?
- You were into it.

582
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,986
I was not into...

583
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,679
I was rocking your body in there.

584
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,159
All right. All right.

585
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,159
I'm sorry. I can see how that
might have made you uncomfortable,

586
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,839
and I apologize.

587
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,359
- It's a little confusing, Sorry.
- All right. It won't happen again.

588
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,439
- Okay.
- Understood.

589
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,159
- How was it in general though?
- Oh my God, it's so weird.

590
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,279
- It's so strange.
- It's really odd.

591
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,639
I mean, you were just...
You were wonderful.

592
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,119
You were funny and charming,

593
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,439
and you just kept telling
me all these great things

594
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,959
we should do on the property and...

595
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,759
Does he feel like me to you?

596
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,343
He is you... He's just a little...

597
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,199
A little what?

598
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,479
It's... How to describe it...
You know,

599
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,479
it's like you're funny, you know.

600
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,239
You have a great sense of humor
and everyone likes you and...

601
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,319
Thanks.

602
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,159
And that's who you are... In there,

603
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,199
but it's like a memory of it.

604
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,799
It's like I'm being reminded
of it or something,

605
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,199
but it's happening
right in front of me.

606
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,862
- Hmm.
- Does that make any sense?

607
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,828
You're not saying
that like it's like...

608
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,239
The better version when
you're in there, right?

609
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,999
- No, no, no, no, no.
- You're just...

610
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,399
Not at all. That's the crazy thing.

611
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,107
It is you in there, you know?

612
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,279
What about the physicality...
Do you notice any differences?

613
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,959
No. No, not really.

614
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,541
Yeah.

615
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,750
You know what, the hair.

616
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,064
There's something about the hair.

617
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,159
The hair?

618
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,479
Mmm-hmm. It's a little different.

619
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,269
It's like it's a little messier,
it's kind of beachy.

620
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,439
- Did you say beachy?
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

621
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,799
Come here. Let me see.

622
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,599
It's like, like kind of... No.

623
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,599
Well, well, it's like really...

624
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,546
I don't know. I'm not doing
it right or something.

625
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,959
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

626
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,159
Don't worry about it.

627
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,759
Cool.

628
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,831
Oh, and you know what,
you don't wear glasses.

629
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,479
You don't wear glasses in there
and you seem totally fine with it.

630
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,106
Well.

631
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,519
In the guest house, I'm a
surfer with perfect vision.

632
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,079
We'll work on this.

633
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,959
It's not quite... No, it's good.

634
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,479
We're getting there.

635
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,262
You've tried contacts, right?

636
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,420
Hey, Soph?

637
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,919
Hmm?

638
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,503
I'd like to take my session at the
guest house now if that's cool.

639
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,559
What time is it?

640
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,062
It's late, but I just can't sleep.

641
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,584
Oh, okay, sweetie.

642
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,559
Okay. I love you.

643
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,266
I love you.

644
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,868
What are you talking about? There
are like six versions of the same doll.

645
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,199
They're completely
unique in every way.

646
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,479
There are six different ladies here.

647
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,903
- I don't see it.
- Okay.

648
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:08,439
This one is the beautiful model
who is always talking about

649
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,227
how she was such a
nerd in high school,

650
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,799
and then oh, this one...
It definitely has two

651
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,799
tramp stamps underneath
that dress, for sure.

652
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,064
And then you've got...

653
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,030
This one is the coolest
girl in the world,

654
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,479
and she'd make the
most wonderful wife,

655
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,039
but no one's going to be able
to look past her chubby thighs.

656
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,599
Which one of these is your favorite?
Which one do you like the most?

657
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,879
Okay.

658
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,030
Ready for this?

659
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,505
Ooh, I dropped it.

660
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,279
How is that not the cutest
thing you've ever seen?

661
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,359
- It really is cute.
- It's so tiny.

662
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,225
It's adorable.

663
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,799
Hey.

664
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,506
Hi.

665
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,199
What you doing?

666
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,519
Nothing. What are you doing?

667
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,146
Nothing.

668
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,781
Have you...

669
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,826
Have I what?

670
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,959
Nothing.

671
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,700
Never mind.

672
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,359
So, what's on the agenda for today?

673
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,261
I was going to maybe
go explore some more

674
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,839
and you know, just... If that's okay.

675
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,759
- Of course.
- What about you?

676
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,389
I don't know. I thought I'd
maybe just hang out here, read.

677
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,119
Sounds nice. Maybe I'll
come by in a little bit

678
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,559
and we can spend some time.

679
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,919
Whatever you want.

680
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,626
Great.

681
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,945
Oh, I found your phone.

682
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,346
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.

683
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,905
Come on.

684
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,506
Hello.

685
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,504
I'm up here.

686
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,185
Watch your head, okay?

687
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,559
Very cute up here.

688
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,919
It's a little small.

689
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,071
What are you doing up here?

690
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,186
I'm feeling very big.

691
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,279
I feel enormous.

692
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,079
Um, I'm glad you're here

693
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,759
because there is something
I want to talk to you about.

694
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,399
And it's a bit of an
elephant in the room,

695
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,382
and I think it's time we discuss it.

696
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,264
- All right.
- Okay.

697
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,639
- This...
- Oh, that.

698
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,759
...is happening.

699
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,959
- Oh, Well.
- Ladies first.

700
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,621
In that case.

701
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,719
- Who the fuck starts with O?
- I know.

702
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,879
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- It's crazy.

703
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,359
Goddamn anarchist.

704
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,340
All right. I'll just do
an X in the middle.

705
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,711
That's a great move.

706
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,439
I think I see where this is headed.

707
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,783
I'm not quite sure yet.

708
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,959
Yeah, I'm going to block you there.

709
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,039
- Where do you think I should go?
- How's it going to end?

710
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,399
What do you think I should do?

711
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,119
- Who's going to win?
- Oh, the suspense!

712
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,199
Oh, yes, and there it is.

713
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,319
What's your next game?

714
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,319
My next game is something
that is appropriate

715
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,919
for people over the age of six.

716
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,159
I think that's a thing.

717
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,583
Why don't you kiss me any more?

718
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,639
Um, I've enjoyed just hanging
out and reconnecting and...

719
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,959
I have, too.

720
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,102
I know, but I love kissing
you and I miss it.

721
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,039
Is there something I'm doing
that's bothering you or...

722
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,999
Oh my God, no, not at all.

723
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,229
Because I feel like we're
having a good time?

724
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,181
- We're having a great time.
- Yeah.

725
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,839
- Give me this.
- You're taking my chalk.

726
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,519
That's my... That's my chalk.

727
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,624
I know it's your chalk.

728
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,626
Hey.

729
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,799
All right. This is weird,

730
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,621
but I think some of
my shirts are missing.

731
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,670
- Really?
- Yeah.

732
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,319
Are you sure they're not
just hanging in the closet

733
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,199
and you didn't pack them
like you usually do?

734
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,590
No, no. Stuff that I
packed is not here.

735
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,479
- Well, that's weird.
- Yeah. That's weird.

736
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,239
What's so funny?

737
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,079
Oh, nothing, I guess.

738
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,319
Just a funny text.

739
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,470
Oh yeah? Who's texting you?

740
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,501
Um...

741
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,999
Wait, he's texting you?

742
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,239
Babe, it's nothing.

743
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,079
It's just a text, okay?

744
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,867
I'm not upset.
I just think it's weird.

745
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,702
They have cellphones?

746
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,344
What plan do they even have?

747
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,150
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.

748
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,750
So nice outside today.

749
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,622
Can I ask you a question?

750
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,506
Of course.

751
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,982
Why did you do it?

752
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,908
Why did you cheat on me?

753
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,467
I'm sorry. That's probably...

754
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,559
- That's okay.
- Not something you want to...

755
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,239
No, that's okay.

756
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,347
I have been thinking about
that a bit this weekend,

757
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,941
and

758
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,870
I have no excuse.

759
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,439
Of course I was insecure

760
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:48,581
and of course we were
drifting apart at the time

761
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,239
and instead of trying to communicate

762
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:56,461
I lashed out and I made a
terrible decision, and

763
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,181
that's...

764
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,301
Right.

765
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,839
No, let me finish.

766
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,502
That's no excuse.

767
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:13,466
You had every right to abandon me,

768
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:21,959
but you didn't, and you
stuck in there with me

769
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,799
and you went to see that
stupid therapist that we see,

770
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,719
even though we didn't want to,
and you kept going,

771
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,839
and you kept trying,
and you met me halfway

772
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:39,159
and I was defensive and
I'm sorry about that.

773
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:44,541
And I want to say thank you
for making those efforts for us,

774
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,479
and I promise you I'm
going to do my best

775
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,189
to meet you there, okay?

776
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,271
I promise.

777
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,879
Hello.

778
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,427
Hey.

779
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,669
I didn't hear you
get up this morning.

780
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,582
I just came down to see if
there was anything on TV.

781
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,479
What, do you think I'm lying to you?

782
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,039
No.

783
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,191
No, I was... Just seemed to...

784
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,909
Is there anything you
want to talk about?

785
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,359
No.

786
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,559
There anything you
want to talk about?

787
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,439
Look, this weekend is super weird...

788
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,799
- That's okay, right?
- Yeah.

789
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,986
I mean, you know,
I think it can be confusing,

790
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,620
but I just...

791
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,359
You know it's not real, right?

792
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:13,024
I mean, I'm not that guy
out there doing sit-ups...

793
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:21,279
And I could never
be really interested

794
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,279
in some other version of you,

795
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,919
knowing that my real
Sophie is here...

796
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,439
- Right.
- And I just...

797
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,639
I want to make sure you still agree.

798
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,266
Yeah.

799
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,381
Of course.

800
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,479
- Okay.
- Yeah.

801
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,639
Okay.

802
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,159
- Okay. We good?
- Yeah, we're good.

803
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,027
- Of course we're good.
- All right.

804
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,039
<i>Thanks a lot for calling me at two in
the morning. I really appreciate it.</i>

805
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,599
<i>Like I don't have a job
to wake up for tomorrow.</i>

806
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,399
<i>Maybe next time you can't
remember where you live,</i>

807
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,159
<i>you should ask your wife.</i>

808
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,639
<i>I'm not sure what you were doing</i>

809
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,427
<i>at two in the morning anyway, but...</i>

810
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,319
<i>Hey, Bunny. It's mama.</i>

811
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,639
<i>I was just thinking about
our conversation yesterday.</i>

812
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,719
<i>I don't know.</i>

813
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,599
<i>You just didn't sound
like your usual self,</i>

814
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,999
<i>so I just wanted to
be sure you're okay...</i>

815
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,039
<i>Hey, man. The street you
grew up on was Berkman.</i>

816
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,559
<i>Hope that clears things up.</i>

817
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,585
<i>Talk to you soon.</i>

818
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,119
Hey.

819
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,701
- Hey.
- Um...

820
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,559
So something really
weird just happened.

821
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:56,679
I got a bunch of voice mails
from my mom and Doug and Dave

822
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,502
saying I had called them
asking really weird questions,

823
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,382
but I didn't call them.

824
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,159
- That is weird.
- Yeah.

825
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,319
Do you think you pocket dialed them?

826
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,879
I don't think the pocket
dial makes as much sense

827
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,159
because I was talking
and asking questions.

828
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,981
- I would have...
- So what do you think it was?

829
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,999
Oh, you think that he called them.

830
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,559
Yeah, and to me that's
a logical conclusion.

831
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,639
He looks like me. He sounds like me.

832
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,719
He's got a cellphone.

833
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,839
I think he might be
impersonating me or something.

834
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,879
Right. I just don't think
that he would do that.

835
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,462
Do you think you know him that well?

836
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,559
Well, I mean I know him a
little better than you do.

837
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,585
You've never met him.

838
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,319
But I mean it's weird.

839
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,300
I can totally ask him if you want.

840
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,599
No, that's okay.

841
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,919
- It's just...
- Okay.

842
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,279
- It's just a weird thing.
- Okay.

843
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,020
It is weird.

844
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,959
I'm going to go to the store.
Do you want me to get you anything?

845
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,719
Uh, no. I'm good.

846
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,639
- Thanks.
- Well, you can come if you want.

847
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,950
Do you mind if I just hang out here?

848
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,479
- Of course not.
- Okay.

849
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,220
Okay.

850
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,799
Hey, babe.

851
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,519
Uh, sorry.

852
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,226
Great.

853
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,839
Hey.

854
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,799
Is this a bad time?

855
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,879
No, no.

856
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,623
I was, doing some sit-ups.

857
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,271
I need to talk to you.

858
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,239
What do you want to talk about?

859
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,629
What happened the
last time I was here.

860
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,039
Yeah, that was obviously
important. Yeah.

861
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,199
Ethan, you're so good at articulating

862
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,439
exactly what it is that I'm feeling

863
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,399
in a way that I can't even do,

864
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,519
and it's everything that
I've been wanting to hear,

865
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,022
but now I don't know what to do.

866
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,344
I can't get it out of my head.

867
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:25,427
Well, I'm glad I said what you
wanted to hear, you know.

868
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,190
Is there anything else you
wanted to see me about?

869
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,940
I've missed this.

870
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,825
Me too.

871
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,101
Hi.

872
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,985
Where are the groceries?

873
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,559
What?

874
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,222
What about the store? What happened?

875
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,268
- The store was closed.
- Oh.

876
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,266
Hey, how about I make
us a couple of mimosas?

877
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,304
I'm not really in the mood for
a mimosa right now, Sophie.

878
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,079
Aw, come on. It'll be fun.

879
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,279
We'll have a drink. We'll relax.

880
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,599
Start this day off right.

881
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,865
Then we can talk about
whatever is bothering you.

882
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,787
You know, that's really good advice.

883
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,982
And I should probably listen to it...

884
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,103
But you're not a real person.

885
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,104
You know you're not real.

886
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,346
Who the hell are you?

887
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,639
What the hell are you?
Are you a fucking robot?

888
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:35,543
Are you a... Like a spirit?

889
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,759
Because I've got to
say it's bad enough

890
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,319
that I'm losing my wife
to a mirror image of me

891
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,359
who happens to be like 20% cooler

892
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,199
and 20% more emotionally
evolved than me.

893
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,879
Now I have to sit and
look at a mirror image

894
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,667
of exactly who I'm losing.

895
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,670
So, no...

896
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,599
I'm having a hard time
enjoying this weekend

897
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,679
because this is the
weekend I lose my wife.

898
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,263
So, pardon me if I don't
want a fucking mimosa, okay?

899
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,428
It wasn't just this weekend.

900
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,420
How do you know?

901
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:25,460
Because as your wife,
I know these things.

902
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,266
Shit!

903
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,759
Uh-oh. I can't stop it.
I can't stop it.

904
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,308
Look what you did. Look what you did.

905
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,799
What? Souvenir?

906
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,745
Here comes the firehose.

907
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,599
I'm going to spray you down.
Are you on fire?

908
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,679
Why are you twirling a fire hose?

909
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,907
Where did you get this sweater?

910
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,025
What?

911
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,999
Where'd you get this?

912
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,639
I don't know. I've always had it.

913
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,839
- Really?
- Yeah, you just...

914
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,229
You don't notice my clothes, I guess.

915
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,468
Do you remember when you got it?

916
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,039
Do you want to talk about clothes?

917
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:55,639
Or would you rather have the
full Chippendales experience?

918
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,039
What's the full experience?

919
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,159
Well...

920
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,119
I don't think I have
enough cash on me.

921
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,919
You just put that away.
You don't worry about that.

922
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,341
Sophie?

923
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,039
Sophie, open the door.

924
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,905
Come on. It's me.

925
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,519
I know you're in there
with him, Sophie.

926
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,239
Come on. Open up!

927
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,186
Will you just give me...
Hold on one second.

928
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,549
Sophie, come on. Let me in.

929
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,759
Sophie.

930
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:43,039
I'm just going to keep knocking.

931
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,439
I'm going to keep knocking.

932
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,719
I know what you're doing in there.

933
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,919
I'm going to keep knocking.

934
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,559
Sophie, let me in.

935
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,630
Come on, Sophie. Open up.

936
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,759
- Where is he?
- Ethan, what are you doing?

937
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,839
- Where are you?
- Ethan, come on.

938
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,919
Ethan, stop!

939
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,279
I'll beat his ass. Where are you?

940
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,359
Where are you?

941
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,021
Goddamn it!

942
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,159
Good. He's gone.

943
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,679
What the hell is going on in here?

944
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,279
Where did he go? Look what you did!

945
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,639
What I did? Are you insane?

946
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,719
Yes, what you did.

947
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,870
What if he never comes back?

948
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,199
Sophie, come on.

949
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,199
Sophie, get back here.

950
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,279
Sophie.

951
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,439
He is not real, okay?

952
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,359
Sophie, how can you accept something

953
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,879
that you know is a blatant lie?

954
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,879
You keep saying it's
not real, it's not real,

955
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,799
but I'm happy.

956
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,839
I'm feeling that. How is that fake?

957
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,479
Do you hear how insane you sound?

958
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,759
You're not admitting that this
is just the least bit weird?

959
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,183
It's not weird for me any more.

960
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,599
So what's the endgame? Huh?

961
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,119
How do you see this playing out?

962
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,359
Are you going to write letters,

963
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,999
come back and visit after
we leave this weekend?

964
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,661
I'm not leaving.

965
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,039
What do you mean, you're not leaving?

966
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,639
Sophie, what the hell
do you mean you're...

967
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,507
This is... Okay, all right.

968
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,039
Sophie, come on.

969
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:59,879
Let's just take a breath here, okay?

970
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,639
I know you're feeling
something that is magical

971
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,079
and clearly exciting to you,

972
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:07,868
but if you think about it logically,
literally for one second...

973
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,466
Is this weird for you now?

974
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,039
Does anybody remember any
of those fun icebreaker games

975
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,679
that kids do at summer camp...

976
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:39,479
Spin the bottle or seven minutes
in heaven or something...

977
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,559
Anyhow, we just thought it was time

978
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,439
that the four of us sit down

979
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,359
and get to know each
other a little bit.

980
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,159
You want to get to know each other?

981
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,879
Hi, Sophie.

982
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,620
Hi.

983
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,399
Okay. Um...

984
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,319
Let's get to know each other.

985
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,879
Why don't you tell us the truth
of what's really going on?

986
01:01:58,880 --> 01:01:59,999
The truth?

987
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,799
Yeah, that you basically have
been pretending to be me,

988
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,359
acting like I don't exist

989
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,959
even though you knew I
was here the whole time.

990
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,959
Ethan, I wasn't
pretending to be anyone.

991
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,224
I was just being myself.

992
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,359
You knew about me, right?

993
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,279
Did he mention me
to you at any point?

994
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,270
Not until this morning.

995
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,559
All right. Maybe all of us

996
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:23,439
were doing a little
pretending this weekend.

997
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,430
It's not a big deal.

998
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,039
I really like your shoes.

999
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,622
Oh, thank you.

1000
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,279
I really like your hair
pinned back like that.

1001
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,799
It's super cute.

1002
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:40,439
I'm sorry. I still am not
buying that you are real.

1003
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,199
Ethan, I'm sitting here,

1004
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,679
you're looking at me sitting here.

1005
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:45,999
I'm real.

1006
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,879
You're sitting across from me, right?

1007
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,359
I'm looking at you sitting there,

1008
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:53,581
so by your logic maybe
you're not real.

1009
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:56,109
That doesn't make any sense.

1010
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,319
I'm starving.

1011
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,879
Ethan, why don't you
clean yourself up

1012
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,745
and we'll all have a little dinner.

1013
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,941
There.

1014
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,919
So, anybody interested in
going on a hike tomorrow?

1015
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,959
I've been wanting to do that
ever since we got here.

1016
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,439
I would love that.

1017
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,959
All right.

1018
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,119
Tonight though,
I'm thinking game night.

1019
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,479
All right.

1020
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:29,239
Okay, maybe you're real,
but can we admit

1021
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,399
this isn't some normal dinner party?

1022
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,159
Ethan, you're looking
a little uncomfortable.

1023
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,359
Can I help you with something?

1024
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,239
Okay, so according to you,

1025
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,359
this is just some average weekend.

1026
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:39,919
We all go home tomorrow,

1027
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,708
and you don't need any further
explanation than that?

1028
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,159
Sometimes these things just happen.

1029
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,742
Yeah, that's right. They do.

1030
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,706
I don't buy it.

1031
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:53,919
All right.

1032
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,719
One time I read this article
on cosmic occurrences.

1033
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,839
I wish I still had it...
You would love it.

1034
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,559
And it basically says
that aberrations happen.

1035
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,559
You can drive yourself nuts
trying to derive meaning

1036
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,381
from things that have no
meaning to begin with.

1037
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:07,879
That's so interesting.

1038
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,506
It is, isn't it?

1039
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,239
It's not that interesting.

1040
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,679
Let me think of an
little example for you,

1041
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:16,159
something right up your alley.

1042
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,879
Um...

1043
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,679
Let's say you buy a gorilla.

1044
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,227
Excuse me?

1045
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,439
Let's say you buy a gorilla, Ethan.

1046
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,679
You can't buy a gorilla.

1047
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,639
I know that, it was for the story.

1048
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,825
But fine, let's say you
buy an aardvark, okay?

1049
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,119
You take that aardvark,
you put him in a dark room.

1050
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,799
A minute later you flip that
switch, the lights come on.

1051
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,399
Now we all know how
electricity works,

1052
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,519
but for him it's a miracle.

1053
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,879
Magic happened...

1054
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,839
That previously dark
room is now illuminated

1055
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:49,229
with possibilities he's
never seen before...

1056
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,519
And what does he do?

1057
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,227
Does he ruin it by
questioning how or why?

1058
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:57,311
No. He enjoys it.

1059
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,599
Huh.

1060
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,909
Well, I'm not an aardvark.

1061
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,509
And I am not a gorilla.

1062
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,425
Don't worry about it. I got it.

1063
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,621
Hmm.

1064
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,266
There's a little bit left.

1065
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,107
Should we finish it?

1066
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:42,359
This is quite the situation.

1067
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,146
You can say that again.

1068
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:48,782
Has Ethan... I mean your Ethan...

1069
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,599
Have you guys talked about anything

1070
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,039
or has he said anything
to you at all?

1071
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,587
Like What?

1072
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,879
Well, Ethan... My Ethan
and I, we've discussed it.

1073
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,679
Like he knew when I was
going to go in the house

1074
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,399
and I knew when he
was going to and...

1075
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,629
You shared your experiences.

1076
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,719
Yeah, for the most part.

1077
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:12,827
And you want to know if we
shared our experiences also.

1078
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,990
Guess I'm just curious.

1079
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,826
I can see that.

1080
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,743
You know what I'm curious about?

1081
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,119
Are you more concerned
with the experiences

1082
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,599
that me and your Ethan shared

1083
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,879
or are you more concerned
with what I know

1084
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,860
about the experiences that
you and my Ethan shared?

1085
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,879
Seems to me you care a lot more

1086
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:38,508
about one of those
scenarios than the other.

1087
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,505
Are you going to give that back?

1088
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,799
I say for the sake of
the super fun evening

1089
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,839
we're about to have,
let's keep it simple

1090
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,119
and keep our cheery dispositions

1091
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:05,679
and I'll keep
complimenting your shoes.

1092
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,799
And you can keep pretending

1093
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,679
that you like the way
I pin my hair back,

1094
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,911
and we'll just have a good
time and see what happens.

1095
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,987
On second thought, do you mind
taking care of those dishes?

1096
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,064
You still haven't told
me where you're from.

1097
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,879
Are we still doing this?

1098
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,839
Are we going to compare
lists of women, too?

1099
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,679
You know, I'm starting
to piece this all together

1100
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,466
and see it for what it is.

1101
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,149
You're trying to sabotage
my relationship.

1102
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:40,039
Ethan, from what I understand
about your relationships,

1103
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:43,749
you should be well versed
in the art of self-sabotage.

1104
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,159
The purpose of tonight
is not to engage

1105
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,389
in some warped
competition between us,

1106
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,199
at least not on my end.

1107
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,270
It wouldn't really be fair.

1108
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,510
Yeah? Why is that?

1109
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,705
Haven't you figured it out yet?

1110
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,559
It's kings.

1111
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,879
It's kings or it's aces
is what's going on.

1112
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,679
There's something going on.

1113
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,547
Why don't you worry
about your own cards.

1114
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,839
I don't even know why
we're continuing right now.

1115
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:13,308
I basically know every
card you're holding.

1116
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,359
Are you saying that I have a tell?

1117
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,919
You have big tells.

1118
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,799
You want to know what your tell is?

1119
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,759
I want to know what you think it is.

1120
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:26,189
You have a very consistent
albeit very cute

1121
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:30,105
Sophie shoulder shrug that
looks a little bit like this.

1122
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,829
Oh! Do you do the shrug?

1123
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,359
Uh, excuse me. Don't talk to her.

1124
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,599
She's dead. She folded.

1125
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,079
It's just you and me now.

1126
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,199
You did the shoulder shrug.

1127
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,599
You obviously have a good hand.

1128
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,079
It's like a high pair or
maybe even three of a kind.

1129
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,279
Fucking raise this shit, man.

1130
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:46,020
You only live once.

1131
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,871
Okay. I'll raise.

1132
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,599
Now I know you have the confidence.

1133
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,759
I have a shit hand.

1134
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,039
I'm folding. Look at that.

1135
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,279
Jesus, are you kidding me?

1136
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,919
- What?
- You're right.

1137
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,119
- Pair of aces.
- Ooh!

1138
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,679
Nailed it, nailed it.

1139
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,679
I knew you had the aces.

1140
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,959
Dude, by the way, you're getting
very good at this game...

1141
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,079
Almost too good.

1142
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:08,060
I'm beginning to think this
is like one long Sophie con.

1143
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,319
He clearly just let you win.

1144
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:13,359
Yes, Ethan. Obviously he let me win.

1145
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,439
Come on, guys.

1146
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,590
This is supposed to just
be a friendly game.

1147
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,399
You're not being very
fun to play with.

1148
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,759
The reason he's not being fun
is because he's not even playing.

1149
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,079
Ethan, if you want to win the game,

1150
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,999
you've got to play some hands, okay?

1151
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,626
That's just how it works.

1152
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,070
All right. Fine. I'll play.

1153
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,559
Deal me in. You and me.

1154
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,679
Come on.

1155
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,670
You want to play one on...

1156
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,399
Okay. All right. That's the spirit.

1157
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,919
Come on, buddy.
Let's get in the game.

1158
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,467
Let's go.

1159
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:47,981
Mmm-hmm.

1160
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,919
All right.

1161
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,104
How many cards do you want?

1162
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,359
I'm fine with what I have.

1163
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,146
Thank you very much.

1164
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,679
Sticking with what you have.

1165
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,199
All right. I'll stick
with what I have, too.

1166
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,781
What's your move?

1167
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,301
I'm all in.

1168
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,999
Oh!

1169
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,239
All in, bold move!

1170
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:13,061
But you've got to be impulsive
sometimes. I really like it.

1171
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,159
All right, so you're all in,

1172
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:18,142
and now I've got to figure
out what is your tell.

1173
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,919
You've got that restless
leg thing going on

1174
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,639
but I think it's just nerves.

1175
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,399
You've been chewing on
the lower lip a little bit,

1176
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,679
but I get ulcers in there, too,

1177
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,919
so maybe that's just what that is.

1178
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,199
So weird lip...

1179
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,319
Oh!

1180
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:34,027
Oh, shit! Of course. There it is.

1181
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,639
The guy who has nothing
and he knows it.

1182
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,507
Sorry, buddy, but I've got
to call you on this one.

1183
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,701
What you got?

1184
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,340
Whatever.

1185
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:52,381
You have nothing and I
win with an ace high.

1186
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,879
Sorry about that, man.

1187
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:57,190
It's fun playing with you, but you've
got to work on your bluffing skills.

1188
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:58,879
You win.

1189
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,359
You're an amazing liar.

1190
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,559
Congratulations on being a shithead.

1191
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,119
- Whoa!
- Ethan, Jesus. Calm down.

1192
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,919
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1193
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,399
I don't want to take
all the credit here.

1194
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,346
You're a pretty decent
liar yourself, right?

1195
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,119
What are you talking about?

1196
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,599
Do you want to tell her or should I?

1197
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:20,759
Is this necessary?

1198
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,959
I think it's important that
Sophie knows what's going on.

1199
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,079
We're all friends here, right?

1200
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,599
Uh, would everybody just tell
me what we're talking about?

1201
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,879
What happened?

1202
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:29,039
It's nothing.

1203
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,871
All right, look,

1204
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,639
Ethan was a little suspicious that
something was going on between us,

1205
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,479
so he decided to try and
figure it out for himself.

1206
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,359
It was actually kind
of a brilliant move.

1207
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,839
He didn't go to the grocery store.

1208
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:43,439
He ended up sneaking
into the guest house,

1209
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,479
and in a strange twist of events,

1210
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:49,079
he pretended to be me,

1211
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:52,759
so you actually slept
with Ethan instead of me.

1212
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:56,039
I can't fucking pretend
to be you... I am me.

1213
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,119
You... What the fuck
are you talking about?

1214
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,439
Just shut up! Sophie, please.

1215
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,430
That was you yesterday?

1216
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,079
Sweetheart...

1217
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:08,199
Basically, first he betrayed

1218
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,879
you by sleeping with someone else

1219
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:14,908
and then he kind of betrayed
you by sleeping with you.

1220
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:19,701
Sorry, guys. I didn't want
to make like a thing here.

1221
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:22,919
If you guys need some
space or something.

1222
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:26,119
If you want to like take the
guest house, you'd be welcome.

1223
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,860
I'm not going anywhere.

1224
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:33,348
No, I want you to leave.

1225
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,679
<i>...if not, leave a detailed message</i>

1226
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:47,879
<i>and I will return your call.</i>

1227
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,599
Hey. It's Ethan.

1228
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,599
Um, I'm really just
calling to thank you

1229
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:56,079
for your wonderful
recommendation this weekend.

1230
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,959
Maybe next session you can send
us to a fucking holocaust museum.

1231
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,700
Thank you very much.

1232
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,199
<i>All right, so we have to hit the
keys at the exact same time.</i>

1233
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,479
<i>This is a strange exercise.</i>

1234
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,799
<i>On three, okay?</i>

1235
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,999
<i>One...</i>

1236
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,319
<i>- All right.
- Two.</i>

1237
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:37,981
<i>Three.</i>

1238
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,467
<i>You met in Scottsdale, Arizona.</i>

1239
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:51,148
<i>We met in Scottsdale, Arizona.</i>

1240
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,879
<i>Madison, you have two sisters, right?</i>

1241
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,519
<i>Yes, two sisters.</i>

1242
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,479
<i>I'm the middle child,
and my dad wasn't present.</i>

1243
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:58,599
Why are you here?

1244
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,119
<i>You were raised in a
predominantly female household</i>

1245
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:03,349
<i>and you had serious...</i>

1246
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:11,228
Ethan and Sophie.

1247
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:24,146
Holy shit!

1248
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,991
<i>All right. Try it again.</i>

1249
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,679
<i>I am Ethan.</i>

1250
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,399
<i>I am Sophie.</i>

1251
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,959
<i>I am Ethan.</i>

1252
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:43,700
<i>I am Sophie.</i>

1253
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,679
<i>I am Ethan.</i>

1254
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,545
<i>I am Sophie.</i>

1255
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,471
<i>I am Ethan.</i>

1256
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,425
<i>I am Sophie.</i>

1257
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,385
<i>I am Ethan.</i>

1258
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,119
<i>I am Sophie.</i>

1259
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,719
<i>I am Ethan.</i>

1260
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:58,079
<i>I am Sophie.</i>

1261
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,199
<i>I am Ethan.</i>

1262
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,319
What the hell is this?

1263
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,519
<i>I am Sophie.</i>

1264
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:02,959
<i>That's getting good.</i>

1265
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,064
<i>You're almost ready.</i>

1266
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,944
I never took that picture.

1267
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:53,022
No, no, no, no.

1268
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,519
No!

1269
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,181
What the...

1270
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:00,519
Shit!

1271
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:01,719
Somebody help!

1272
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:02,839
Help!

1273
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:04,599
Help! Sophie!

1274
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,039
Sophie, can you hear me?

1275
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,269
Sophie, I'm stuck.

1276
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,519
Hey.

1277
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:12,559
Sophie? Sophie, I'm in here.

1278
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,119
Sophie, I'm in here.

1279
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,463
Sophie! I'm stuck.

1280
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,439
- What the...
- We don't have much time.

1281
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,599
They think I'm out picking
fruit for breakfast.

1282
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,181
What?

1283
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:58,143
Okay. A lot happened
last night after you left.

1284
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,919
Do you know that you're Sophie?

1285
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:00,999
Are you pretending?

1286
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,319
I don't know, what's happening?

1287
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,821
I'm not your wife.

1288
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,799
Okay. What the fuck's going on,
and who are you?

1289
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,639
He fell in love with her.

1290
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,159
He's not supposed to
fall in love with her.

1291
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,879
She's supposed to fall
out of love with you.

1292
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,799
That's how this works.
That's how we get out.

1293
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,439
What the hell are you
talking about? I don't...

1294
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:17,159
- That's how we become you.
- You become us?

1295
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:20,079
Pitting you against each other is
the best way to break you down,

1296
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,559
and then it's your turn to stay.

1297
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:22,959
What the fu... What the fuck?

1298
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,079
Oh, my God.

1299
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,359
Did you try to get out last night?

1300
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,759
- Yes.
- You couldn't.

1301
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:27,839
No.

1302
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,679
That's because the closer
we get to moving on,

1303
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,759
the closer you get
to not being able to.

1304
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,319
Do you remember when
you first got here?

1305
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,559
I was stuck here.

1306
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,664
You had to come see me. Now look.

1307
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,919
Ethan.

1308
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,639
Ethan, it's not going to work.

1309
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,119
I have to be the one to let you out.

1310
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:45,919
Well, what? I mean,
what am I supposed to do?

1311
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,679
I don't want to be trapped here.

1312
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,679
- What do you...
- You're not trapped yet.

1313
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,511
I can get you out.

1314
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,479
Listen, only two people
can leave today.

1315
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:55,959
I don't understand.
Why would you help me

1316
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,919
if you're trying to get
yourself out of here?

1317
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,501
Because I love him.

1318
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,741
And I'd rather be trapped here
than see him leave with her.

1319
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:08,839
So you have real feelings
like love and jealousy,

1320
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,671
like a real person?

1321
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,661
I am real.

1322
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:18,439
We should bring a couple
extra bottles of water.

1323
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:20,519
This hike can be a little strenuous.

1324
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,959
How long is the hike?

1325
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,159
I was just thinking I should
probably check on Ethan.

1326
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:26,839
- See if he's okay.
- It's only like an hour.

1327
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:29,946
Plus, I think it's good if he cools
down in the guest house, you know.

1328
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,279
Hey, we're getting ready to head out.

1329
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:33,639
You want to get changed?

1330
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:35,839
Well, all my clothes are
back at the guest house,

1331
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:36,919
and I agree.

1332
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:39,229
I think we should give
Ethan his space.

1333
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,039
I have an extra pair of shoes.

1334
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,383
We're probably the same size.

1335
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,719
Well, that's top's
really cute on you.

1336
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,551
Do you have anything like that?

1337
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,307
I have another one.

1338
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,904
Come on, girls. Let's go.

1339
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,079
They're just right in there,

1340
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,879
the bottom drawer,
and there are some extra shoes.

1341
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,159
Great. Thanks so much.

1342
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,919
Sure. Do you need anything else?

1343
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:08,479
Um, well, my toothpaste and
toothbrush is over there.

1344
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,839
Do you have anything?

1345
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,785
Sure, I'll get you something.

1346
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:16,959
Just give me one minute, please.

1347
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,666
It's important.

1348
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,150
Did you find some clothes for her?

1349
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,719
Yep. She'll be down in a minute.

1350
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,267
Good.

1351
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:33,799
What? Do you understand how
insane you sound right now?

1352
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,519
Yes, I understand, but this whole
fucking weekend has been crazy.

1353
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,359
Think about it. Everything
they knew about us...

1354
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:42,559
The missing clothes and the phone
calls to my mom and my friends.

1355
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:47,861
This entire weekend has been
one planned trap, Sophie.

1356
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:54,471
I'm glad we have a second alone,

1357
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,224
because I wanted to talk to you.

1358
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,545
You do, really?

1359
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,550
I want to talk to you, too.

1360
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,479
What do you want to say?

1361
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,391
You go first.

1362
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:13,345
I've been thinking
a lot about things.

1363
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,829
I don't want to leave with Ethan.

1364
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:22,703
I want to leave with you.

1365
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,948
I want to leave with you, too.

1366
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,424
I love you, Sophie.

1367
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,310
You're not Sophie.

1368
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,421
Where is she?

1369
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,381
Where is she?

1370
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,906
Sophie?

1371
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,866
Come here.

1372
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,581
Sophie?

1373
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,825
Here, come in here, come in here.

1374
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,026
Sophie?

1375
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,759
Look, I don't have
a lot of time, okay?

1376
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:18,839
Sophie.

1377
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,759
And I'm not going to get this right,

1378
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:22,159
but I don't want you to leave.

1379
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:23,479
I don't want you to leave me, Sophie.

1380
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:28,159
Look, I know he is handsome
and smart and eloquent,

1381
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:30,919
and he makes cool
aardvark metaphors, okay?

1382
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,439
Sophie! You know I love you.

1383
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:36,399
And I'm difficult, and I'm stubborn

1384
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,559
and I know that I've been defensive,

1385
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:42,879
and I haven't been what you needed...

1386
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:43,999
Sophie!

1387
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,239
And I take a big part of the
responsibility for why this happened.

1388
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,265
Okay? But listen to me,

1389
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,265
I'm your husband,

1390
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,665
and you're my wife...

1391
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:57,239
And I am not letting you go.

1392
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:59,185
Sophie, unlock the door.

1393
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,439
We're a mess, and I
love that about us,

1394
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:05,279
and I don't want to be perfect.
I want to be us. So please...

1395
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,999
Sophie, he's lying.

1396
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,629
Just give me a chance
before he comes in here.

1397
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,199
I love you.

1398
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,668
Sophie, what is he telling you?

1399
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:21,119
Sophie, Sophie, it's me.

1400
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,199
Come on. Sophie...

1401
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:23,599
We're leaving. Okay.

1402
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,307
Ethan, I need you to step
out of the way, please.

1403
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:28,999
Excuse me.

1404
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,501
Ethan.

1405
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:34,239
- Excuse me.
- Ethan!

1406
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,901
You son of a bitch.

1407
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:38,144
Ethan, stop!

1408
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,461
Stop it!

1409
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,984
Ethan, stop it!

1410
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,119
You guys, come on.

1411
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,959
This is ridiculous.

1412
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,586
Sophie.

1413
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:54,626
All right.

1414
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:57,063
That was a stupid fight.

1415
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,988
Sophie, come on.

1416
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,911
Sophie!

1417
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,901
Fine.

1418
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,428
I'm going to fuck all you guys.

1419
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:51,959
What happens if he can't catch him?

1420
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,079
I have no idea.

1421
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:54,741
Ethan!

1422
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,660
Ethan!

1423
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,661
We've got to get out of here.

1424
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,626
We've got to go.

1425
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,079
<i>Leave a detailed message
and I will return your call.</i>

1426
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:45,399
<i>Hey, it's Ethan.</i>

1427
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:46,719
<i>I know you're dodging my calls.</i>

1428
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,239
<i>I also know you know what's going on,</i>

1429
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:51,391
<i>so we're coming over there right now.</i>

1430
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:24,439
It was a full-on grand theft covers.

1431
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:25,559
I need a visual.

1432
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:26,919
Look at this. Come see.

1433
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:29,399
You were basically a tootsie roll,

1434
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:32,119
wrapped up, rolled
over onto your side,

1435
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:35,119
and you abandoned me on
the other side of the bed

1436
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,279
and I froze my titties off all night.

1437
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,759
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

1438
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,279
That's what you did to me,
your husband.

1439
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:41,879
- That's horrible.
- It really is.

1440
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,999
- What kind of a wife is that?
- I don't know. You're awful.

1441
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,119
You owe me big time.

1442
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,559
Why didn't you just
take the covers back?

1443
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,799
Because you looked really cute
and I didn't want to wake you up.

1444
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,759
Right. No, that makes sense...

1445
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:53,069
I must have been pretty cute.

1446
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:57,119
That was... That was pretty good,

1447
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,999
but you're going to have to
do a little more than that.

1448
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,639
- More?
- I need something else.

1449
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:02,039
- Something else?
- Mmm-hmm.

1450
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:07,387
Uh, what would you say
if I made you breakfast?

1451
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:09,959
I'm not going to say anything more.

1452
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:11,399
I'm just going to try
to let this happen.

1453
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,039
- Okay.
- No sudden movements.

1454
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,759
Be very still.

1455
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:17,519
- I'm not...
- Be very still.

1456
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:18,599
I don't want to...

1457
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,148
Nothing is happening.

1458
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:22,959
Don't even make eye contact.

1459
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:39,182
All right, so what's on the menu?

1460
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:42,386
Well, I was thinking
maybe eggs and bacon.

1461
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,346
I'll be right there.

1461
01:28:29,305 --> 01:29:29,385
