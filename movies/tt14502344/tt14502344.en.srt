WOMAN: There's an isolation
to the woods, isn't there?

3
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:55,055
A sense of unease
in a dark wilderness.

4
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:58,266
Because things disappear there.

5
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,102
Things die there.

6
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:05,065
But she wasn't afraid.
Not at first.

7
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,483
Even though she was alone,

8
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,819
she knew
she could survive the night.

9
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:15,367
But as she got deeper into
the forest, she smelled it.

10
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:19,996
The rot. The smell of death.

You hear the words

and you start to imagine all
kinds of homophobic bullshit.

Well, that is not
what we're about here.

another thing.

God...
God doesn't hate you either.

And any son of a bitch
that tells you otherwise

is a bigoted asshole.

that you're gonna hear
about the man upstairs.

I promise you.

47
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,722
But I'm guessing
that some of you are here

48
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,017
because in some way
you're not happy.

49
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,102
Maybe you don't fit in.

50

People make fun of you.

51
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,815
Maybe you wanna find
some new kind of peace,

52
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,151
a new way of thinking
about yourself.

53
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:47,282
Well, you give us this week,
and we might be able to help.

She is our licensed therapist,

59
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:07,719

from the name, my wife.

She who must be obeyed.

Next to her is Nurse Molly

62
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,099
who takes care of any
little mishaps that may occur.

63
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,770
Molly's new here,
so take it easy on her.

64
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,439
And that's Zane,
our athletics director

65
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,149
and a former student here.

66
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,901
So, he knows all the ropes.

67
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,112
And, boys, he's taken,
so hands off.

68

And that beautiful woman
right there

69
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,910
is Sarah, Zane's fiancÃ©.

70

She's our activities director,

71

So please treat him kindly.

to hand over

and computers.

that we don't have any Wi-Fi.

will be a nice change, I'm sure.

Molly, if you would. Thank you.

88
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,760
OK. Let me tell you
how the next week is gonna work.

89
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:34,514
We have a number of planned
activities and therapy sessions

90
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,641
that we would like you
to be part of.

91
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,561
But other than that,
you're on your own.

92
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,772
We do have
one hard-and-fast rule here.

93
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,733
And it's about respect.

94
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,359
We deal
with some sensitive issues,

95
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:50,488
and we expect you to treat
your fellow students with care.

96
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,574
And allow them their dignity.

97
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,202
This is a safe space.

98
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,746
For everyone.

99
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,666
And this is
the most important thing

100
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,918
that I want to say to you.

101
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,590
I know that many of you are here

102
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,968
only because your parents
made you.

103
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,889
And while their intentions
may be honorable,

104
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,933
only you can know
what's best for you.

105
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,602
Because the idea of this place

106
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:24,564
is not to come out
more straight or less gay.

107
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,858
Of course we hope
that through your time here

108
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,027
you will discover
a gender normative lifestyle

109
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,279
that is authentic for you but...

110
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:36,618
you must find your own truth.

111
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,954
Let us help you do that.

112
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,040
Please.

113
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:49,673
OK. So, uh, why don't you
head to your cabins?

114
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,257
Settle in. Unpack.

115
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,969
We'll meet in the lodge in say,
uh, a half hour and get started.

116
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,139
Boys' cabin over there.
Girls' cabin over there.

117
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,409
Yes.

118
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:22,288
- So this is a thing.
- OK.

119
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,793
I'm trans and non binary.
I use they/them pronouns.

120
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:31,006
As in, they can't believe
they're at this fucking camp.

121
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,676
I'm assuming you don't have
an all-gender cabin.

122
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:38,263
No. Not currently.
Obviously we need one.

123
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,682
Maybe so.

124
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:47,105
This place
is all about inclusion.

125
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,567
About being with other kids

126
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,861
and finding
a sense of community.

127
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:57,032
So it's important
that nobody be isolated.

128
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:01,703
I acknowledge
and respect your transition.

129
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:04,289
So head over to the boys' cabin,

130
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,500
and if you don't feel
comfortable there,

131
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,045
we can talk about other options.

132
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,380
How's that?

133
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,592
Sounds great.

134
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,845
Great. Thanks.

135
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:22,307
And thanks for understanding.

136
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:41,034

- Yes, ma'am.

138
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:54,422
I want to start with a simple
question. Why are you here?

139
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,138
Toby?

140
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,893
I'm here because

141
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:11,773
I don't want to be
a big flaming fruit anymore.

142
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:16,569
I wanna play hockey
and drink non-light beer

143
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,863
like all the normal guys.

144
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,451
I made a deal with my parents.
If I spent the week here,

145
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,704
I could go to New York
and see Moulin Rouge!

Cause I'm bisexual.
So, I'm a freak and I hate it.

156
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,982
All right? Are you happy?

I have to, like, throw up.

163
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,505
I'd die if they found out.

164
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:25,722
It's like I'm pretending
to be this thing and...

165
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,932
I don't wanna pretend anymore.

166
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,934
My parents made me come.

167
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,353
I just wanna fit in.

168
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,438
It was come here or you're out
on the street, honey.

169
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,066
When I go to college, I'm gonna
pledge my dad's fraternity,

170
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:39,110
which I kind of have to,
or he's gonna, like, disown me.

and get some fucking peace.

179
00:13:55,627 --> 00:14:00,882
I have zero interest in not
being gay. I love me some lady.

180
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:04,135
I hear it all the time. "Fag."

181

"There goes the fag."
"Blow me, fag."

I don't wanna waste my soul
fighting this thing.

Jordan, this is
a circle of trust.

196

We all shared.
Why are you here?

197
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,953
I come from a religious family.

198
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,623
They don't understand me.

199
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:19,627
We made a deal.
If I come here for a week...

200
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,465
they'll let me legally
emancipate myself.

201
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,011
Emancipate yourself to do what?

202
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,681
Be myself.

203
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,939

00:48:15,603 --> 00:48:16,938
(GASPS)

482
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:24,738
(SMASHING CONTINUES)

483
00:48:24,779 --> 00:48:26,406
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

484
00:48:26,448 --> 00:48:28,575
Today we're gonna shake it up
a little bit.

485
00:48:28,616 --> 00:48:32,078
Boys, you come with me and Zane.
Girls, you go with Sarah.

486
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,164
Enjoy this beautiful morning.

487
00:48:34,205 --> 00:48:37,375
It's a great day to be alive,
isn't it?

488
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:40,920
Come on, Duke.
Come on. Let's go, boy.

489
00:48:40,962 --> 00:48:42,589
- Let's get out of here.
- See ya.

490
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:44,632
Come on, ladies. This way.

491
00:48:49,262 --> 00:48:51,473
- He's sick.
- What?

492
00:48:51,514 --> 00:48:54,476
When our dog got sick,
he walked like that.

493
00:48:54,517 --> 00:48:58,480
So sad.
I hate to see animals in pain.

494
00:48:59,564 --> 00:49:02,984
I have a new dog now.
He's a dachshund.

495
00:49:03,026 --> 00:49:07,489
- Miniature, of course.
- Of course.

496
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:09,449
Now, don't laugh.
I know, I know.

497
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:11,201
I look like homemaker Barbie.

498
00:49:11,242 --> 00:49:12,869
Barbie was never that hot.

499
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:16,873
Today we're gonna be exploring
traditional gender roles.

500
00:49:16,915 --> 00:49:19,209
By behaving in a certain way,

501
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,877
by learning to recognize

502
00:49:20,919 --> 00:49:23,463
and accept modes
of societal behaviors,

503
00:49:23,505 --> 00:49:26,299
perhaps we'll come to appreciate
the emotional value

504
00:49:26,341 --> 00:49:28,843
in reinforcing these behaviors.

505
00:49:28,885 --> 00:49:33,348
Even finding comfort and a sense
of community within them.

506
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:37,018
So, ladies.

507
00:49:37,852 --> 00:49:39,562
Let's make a pie.

508
00:49:41,439 --> 00:49:42,732
(CHUCKLES)

509
00:49:45,151 --> 00:49:46,986
OWEN: OK. Listen up.

510
00:49:47,028 --> 00:49:49,781
Two things control this world.

511
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:53,410
Biology and history.

512
00:49:53,451 --> 00:49:57,247
I know this is not
a popular thing to say nowadays,

513
00:49:57,288 --> 00:49:59,916
but men have naturally evolved

514
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:04,170
to be larger and stronger
than women.

515
00:50:04,212 --> 00:50:05,797
There's a reason for that.

516
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,425
Our forefathers were hunters.

517
00:50:08,466 --> 00:50:12,095
They had to chase down game
and subdue it.

518
00:50:12,137 --> 00:50:16,016
They hunted or they starved.

519
00:50:16,057 --> 00:50:18,685
It's in our DNA, gentlemen.

520
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:20,770
We're meant to be killers.

521
00:50:21,604 --> 00:50:24,357
This is
our biological imperative.

522
00:50:24,399 --> 00:50:28,903
And no amount of civilization,
no amount of progress,

523
00:50:28,945 --> 00:50:35,618
no amount of liberal humanism
can alter that genetic truth.

524
00:50:36,953 --> 00:50:39,289
You can't argue with science.

525
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:40,623
And science tells us that

526
00:50:40,665 --> 00:50:43,543
we are meant to pass
that necessary DNA

527
00:50:43,585 --> 00:50:47,714
down through the bloodline,
through women,

528
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:51,259
through impregnating women
and having children.

529
00:50:52,635 --> 00:50:56,097
That is science.
And that is history.

530
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,100
So...

531
00:51:00,852 --> 00:51:03,271
Who's got the killer instinct?

532
00:51:12,614 --> 00:51:15,784
- Oh, amazing. Good job.
- Thank you.

533
00:51:19,287 --> 00:51:22,749
Oh, that's beautiful, Kim.
Really exceptional work.

534
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:26,086
- Good for you, honey.
- I bake with my mom.

535
00:51:26,127 --> 00:51:29,464
That's great.
You know, I did that too.

536
00:51:29,506 --> 00:51:32,801
Oh, you've got a bit of flour
on your chin.

537
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,680
There. That's better.

538
00:51:36,721 --> 00:51:39,599
What is that lipstick?
It is so pretty.

539
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:42,852
- Um, uh, it's, like, coral.
- Oh.

540
00:51:42,894 --> 00:51:44,062
From the mall.

541
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:45,855
Will you let me borrow it
sometime?

542
00:51:45,897 --> 00:51:47,482
Hey.

543
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:49,651
What do we do with all
these pies when they're done?

544
00:51:49,693 --> 00:51:52,237
Why, we serve them to the boys,
of course.

545
00:51:52,278 --> 00:51:54,322
Serve them as in wait on them?

546
00:51:56,908 --> 00:52:00,328
Oh, a little domesticity
won't kill you, dear.

547
00:53:04,142 --> 00:53:05,977
CORA: Molly!

548
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,898
What are you doing here?

549
00:53:09,939 --> 00:53:12,692
I'm sorry.
I was just... just wandering.

550
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:16,613
Well, this place
isn't up to code. It's not safe.

551
00:53:16,654 --> 00:53:18,490
OK. Sorry.

552
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:23,745
You are with the program, right?

553
00:53:26,664 --> 00:53:27,749
Yes, of course.

554
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:33,338
I knew you were family.
(CHUCKLES)

555
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,006
Come along then, dear.

(GUNS FIRING)

00:53:56,945 --> 00:54:01,282
Alexandra. Girl vs wild.

558
00:54:11,543 --> 00:54:13,837
- You've done this before.
- Oh, yeah.

559
00:54:13,878 --> 00:54:18,425
Once or twice.
Between drag shows, you know.

560
00:54:18,466 --> 00:54:20,176
How about we make it
more challenging?

561
00:54:20,218 --> 00:54:22,345
How about a little contest,
you and me?

562
00:54:23,054 --> 00:54:26,307
- You bet.
- Hold your fire!

563
00:54:28,601 --> 00:54:31,980
Move those two back ten feet.
Give us clean targets.

564
00:54:37,944 --> 00:54:42,073
JORDAN: I'm guessing you're
pretty good with firearms.

565
00:54:42,115 --> 00:54:45,452
Oh, yeah. Well, me and my dad
used to hunt a lot.

566
00:54:48,246 --> 00:54:52,625
I wonder what that's like.
Being hunted.

567
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:56,338
Knowing no matter what you do,
you're gonna die.

'Cause your opponent's
bigger, stronger,

00:55:04,012 --> 00:55:05,847
Oh, and better looking.

571
00:55:08,391 --> 00:55:11,478
- Best out of four?
- Sure.

572
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:13,480
Well, come on, baby boy.
Show me what you got.

573
00:55:13,521 --> 00:55:17,150
No, no, please. Ladies first.

Junior marksman
three years running.

582
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:19,754
Or marks person, I should say.

583
00:56:20,547 --> 00:56:22,882
Well done, Jordan.

584
00:56:22,924 --> 00:56:26,553
You are constantly
surprising me.

585
00:56:26,594 --> 00:56:28,888
Get over it, Zane.
He beat you fair and square.

586
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:30,181
They.

587
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:34,102
That's right. My mistake.

588
00:56:37,564 --> 00:56:39,816
OK. Gather round.

589
00:56:42,152 --> 00:56:44,904
Now, shooting paper targets
is one thing,

590
00:56:44,946 --> 00:56:48,742
but it's not the biological
imperative, is it?

591
00:56:48,783 --> 00:56:52,912
Shooting flesh,
ripping flesh, eating flesh,

592
00:56:52,954 --> 00:56:57,083
that's our genetic programming,
gentlemen.

593
00:56:57,125 --> 00:57:02,964
So, who is gonna live up
to our great ancestors?

Where's my killer?

I'm not really sure
you did your best.

I'm sure. I didn't.

OK, ladies. Nice work today.

598
00:57:28,656 --> 00:57:30,033
And now, you actually have

599
00:57:30,075 --> 00:57:33,161
a bit of unscheduled free time
before dinner.

Go ahead, Veronica.

603
00:57:51,721 --> 00:57:54,974
I think we owe ourselves
a taste, don't we?

604
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:58,269
Just one little slice.

605

Oh. It is just so lovely.
I hate to cut it.

You're lovely too.
Just like your pie.

Perfectly formed. Nice and warm.

Curvy outside.

Juicy inside, I'll bet.

Who's gonna step up
and be worthy of his sex?

Who's got some fucking balls?

- Shit.
- Oh, come on, Mr. Sondheim.

Nothing to be scared of.
You trust me, don't you?

630
00:59:59,557 --> 01:00:02,102
You see old Duke over there?

631
01:00:05,313 --> 01:00:06,773
Shoot him.

632
01:00:10,985 --> 01:00:12,278
Look.

633
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:14,948
He's got cancer.

634
01:00:14,989 --> 01:00:19,703
He's in a lot of pain.
Put him out of his misery.

- No way.
- You're doing him a favor.

Look at him.

637
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,335
He can barely walk anymore.

638
01:00:31,673 --> 01:00:33,174
No.

639
01:00:35,343 --> 01:00:40,807
OK. This is how this is
gonna go down, boyfriend.

640
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:44,019
You're gonna shoot old Duke,

641
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:47,147
or Zane is gonna take

01:31:11,012 --> 01:31:15,475
and burned
all the good out of her.

963
01:31:15,517 --> 01:31:18,019
- You must understand...
- No, I mustn't.

964
01:31:18,061 --> 01:31:21,314
No more words,
Owen. No more speeches!

965
01:31:21,356 --> 01:31:24,984
When Angie left here,
it was the suicide attempts,

966
01:31:25,026 --> 01:31:29,364
and the loneliness,
and the self-hatred,

967
01:31:29,406 --> 01:31:35,704
and pills, and the doctors, and,
oh, the anger, so much anger.

968
01:31:37,122 --> 01:31:41,209
I woke up one morning
and realized...

969
01:31:42,711 --> 01:31:45,213
my soul was just hollow.

970
01:31:47,257 --> 01:31:49,759
But you know all about that.

971
01:31:51,886 --> 01:31:54,556
That's what you do to people.

972
01:31:55,598 --> 01:31:57,225
To children.

973
01:31:58,226 --> 01:32:00,895
You hollow them out.

974
01:32:05,233 --> 01:32:07,652
And when all of this comes out,

975
01:32:08,737 --> 01:32:11,197
in the news, on TV,

976
01:32:11,239 --> 01:32:14,826
all of the bodies,
all the horror of it,

977
01:32:14,868 --> 01:32:21,082
no one will ever send their kids
to a place like this again.

978
01:32:22,542 --> 01:32:26,504
And you, and everyone like you,

979
01:32:26,546 --> 01:32:32,927
will be burning in hell
right next to me.

980

(STRAINS)

981
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:42,020
Stop.

982
01:32:43,271 --> 01:32:45,523
Get off her.

984

Easy now, buddy.

985
01:33:02,415 --> 01:33:04,167
You know what to do, Jordan.

986
01:33:06,169 --> 01:33:07,295
Do it!

987
01:33:09,964 --> 01:33:12,884
Shooting a sick, old dog
is one thing, Jordan.

988
01:33:13,635 --> 01:33:16,388
But shooting a man...

989
01:33:16,429 --> 01:33:21,893
No, sir. I mean, that takes
a certain kind of heart.

990
01:33:22,644 --> 01:33:25,105
You don't know me.

991
01:33:25,146 --> 01:33:27,273
You don't know
anything about me.

992
01:33:27,315 --> 01:33:31,736
Oh, I know everything about you.
I know you're scared.

993
01:33:32,821 --> 01:33:35,615
I know you want this to end.

994
01:33:35,657 --> 01:33:38,243
But not like this, son.
Not like this.

995
01:33:38,993 --> 01:33:41,121
Jordan, you saw the pictures.

996
01:33:41,162 --> 01:33:43,623
All those kids.
All that torture.

997
01:33:43,665 --> 01:33:46,167
You know what he does here.

998
01:33:46,209 --> 01:33:50,714
End this now! You're strong
enough to do this, Jordan.

999
01:34:04,602 --> 01:34:06,229
No.

1000
01:34:08,314 --> 01:34:10,650
I'm strong enough

1001
01:34:10,692 --> 01:34:13,862
to not do this.

1004
01:34:31,629 --> 01:34:37,385
All I did was make those kids
into who they wanted to be.

1005
01:34:38,928 --> 01:34:43,641
You made me too.
And this is my truth.

1006
01:34:43,683 --> 01:34:46,686
Respect. Renew.

1007
01:34:46,728 --> 01:34:49,898
Rejoice. Revenge!

1008
01:35:07,082 --> 01:35:11,252
It gets easier. You'll see.

1009
01:35:12,796 --> 01:35:15,382
There are so many
camps like this.

1010
01:35:15,423 --> 01:35:17,425
We can cleanse them all.

OK.

1013
01:35:28,019 --> 01:35:31,231
So, what are we gonna tell them?
We can say he... did it.

1014
01:35:31,272 --> 01:35:33,274
- He killed them and we...
- Enough.

1015

No more lies.

1016
01:35:40,490 --> 01:35:42,200
Where does it end?

1017
01:35:42,242 --> 01:35:46,663
When every camp
like this is closed.

1018
01:35:46,705 --> 01:35:48,957
When we've killed them all.

1019
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:53,837
We could do that, Jordan.
You and me.

1020
01:35:59,009 --> 01:36:01,344
You can try to stop me,

1021
01:36:01,386 --> 01:36:06,141
but I'm going to go
to my friends now.

1022
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:11,813
We're gonna leave this place
and never look back.

1023
01:36:11,855 --> 01:36:17,485
And no one is ever going to
tell us who we are ever again.

Not him. Not you.

1025
01:36:23,533 --> 01:36:25,368
No one.

1026
01:36:28,705 --> 01:36:30,957
I'm trying to save you.

1027
01:36:35,837 --> 01:36:38,006
No one needs to save me.

01:38:28,491 --> 01:38:32,203
back to the real world now,
I guess.

What are you gonna tell
your parents?

1034

We'll tell them together.
