00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:52,488
Please
cross the bridge and turn left,

3
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,616
and continue to follow
the road for 42 miles.

4
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:33,279
Please turn right and
continue for six miles.

5
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:11,859
Please turn right. You have
reached your destination.

6
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:23,746
All right. How you
doing? I’m Edmond Murray.

7
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:25,832
Hi. Can I see your ID, please?

8
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:26,958
Of course.

9
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:34,340
Here you go.

10
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,969
Mr. Murray’s just arrived.

11
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,762
Copy that.

12
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:41,824
Good morning. My name’s
Officer Birch. How you doing?

13
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:43,850
I’m the initial investigating
officer. Uh-huh.

14
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,744
Ms. Richmond is waiting
for you over by the water.

15
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:48,438
I’m Ethan’s dad. I
know that, Mr. Murray.

16
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,815
I’m afraid that I cannot
comment any further on the case.

17
00:03:50,857 --> 00:03:52,775
Inspector Roy will be
down here later on.

18
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:54,503
He’ll be able to fill
you in on any questions.

19
00:03:54,527 --> 00:03:56,279
Okay. Ms. Richmond is
just down by the water,

20
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,323
if you follow the path over
to the right. Okay. Thank you.

21
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:17,925
Joan!

22
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,514
Fuck. Joan!

23
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:44,869
What are they doing out there?

24
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,497
They’re looking for him.

25
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:49,916
They think he’s in the water?

26
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,460
I don’t know.

27
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:57,882
I don’t know.

28
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,933
What the fuck happened?

29
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,810
I don’t know.

30
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,567
That’s where he was sleeping.

31
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:31,416
You all right? I
can’t go back there.

32
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:48,015
Can I go in there? No, sorry.

33
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:49,183
Fuck.

34
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:42,445
I’ve rented this place.
I’m going to stay here.

35
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:44,572
Okay, I’ll stay somewhere near.

36
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,533
Good.

37
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:57,001
Would you be able to
do something for me?

38
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:58,503
Mm-hmm.

39
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,173
I need you to go
back to the house.

40
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:07,512
Ethan drew me a picture

41
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:09,847
the day before he left and...

42
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:14,185
I can’t stop thinking about it.

43
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:21,818
Thanks.

44
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,962
Do we know anything about the
people that run that camp?

45
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,864
No, they said they’ve
questioned everyone.

46
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:29,992
Did you meet them?
Before you sent him?

47
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:35,415
Yeah, I mean... They
seemed really lovely.

48
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:38,167
The woman was really
lovely. I don’t... Uh-huh.

49
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:41,462
I... I’m sure they were fine.
I’m sure they were fine.

50
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:45,717
I never would have sent him there if I
thought that there was anything wrong. Ever!

51
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:49,011
I know, I know.
You’re a good mum.

52
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:50,179
I know.

53
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,103
Hi.

54
00:07:58,521 --> 00:07:59,897
Are you okay?

55
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,191
-  Yeah.
- Yeah?

56
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:04,652
- It was fine.
- What did they want to know?

57
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:06,863
Well, they just
had some questions.

58
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,656
What sort of stuff?

59
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:10,992
My relationship with Ethan.

60
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,076
Why?

61
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:18,875
No. Are you on your way
back? Can you come back?

62
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:20,793
Okay, all right.

63
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:22,920
- Bye. I love you.
- Love you. Bye.

64
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:25,882
Is that your man? Yeah.

65
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:28,092
Was it his idea to
send him to the camp?

66
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:29,927
Oh, fucking hell.

67
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:33,681
Yeah, sure, it was his idea.

68
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:38,811
He’s my son. Okay?

69
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:42,023
It was my choice. I
wish he hadn’t gone.

70
00:08:42,065 --> 00:08:46,110
So do I. I didn’t want him to
go in the first place, but...

71
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:49,739
kids his age, they’re
doing stuff like that.

72
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:53,826
And Ethan’s not... He’s...

73
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:58,081
He’s different, and he...

74
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,793
he didn’t want to go.

75
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:05,213
And I knew he didn’t want to go.

76
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:10,093
He seemed okay, before he went?

77
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:14,305
I just... I just needed a...

78
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:18,351
I’m sorry.

79
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:21,562
Was it...

80
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:23,648
He’s been having a hard time.

81
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:26,067
Okay?

82
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:47,755
All right?

83
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:50,967
Get them ready to go.

84
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:53,219
Inspector, this is
Eddy, Ethan’s dad.

85
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:55,972
All right, Mr. Murray.

86
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,099
I’m Inspector Roy. Inspector.

87
00:09:58,141 --> 00:10:00,643
I’m running the investigation
with my team here.

88
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:06,190
Mr. Murray, I’d like you to come into my
office this afternoon at 3:00, please.

89
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:07,150
Of course, 3:00.

90
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,193
The details are on the card.

91
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:13,281
And my personal mobile number is
on the back, should you need it.

92
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:18,161
Miss, are you sure you
want to take part in this?

93
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,245
Yeah.

94
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:23,207
Yesterday, you seemed... No.

95
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:26,044
You sure? I’m here. I can take
over. No, I want to do it.

96
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:28,337
Very good.

97
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:30,089
If you’ll just listen
to the instructions

98
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:32,508
and then I’ll tell
you where to stand.

99
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,052
Okay. Thank you.

100
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:35,887
Attention,
please, everyone!

101
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:40,058
This morning, we’re going
to search this entire slope.

102
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:42,977
I want you to move through
the bracken together.

103
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:44,729
You keep two meters apart.

104
00:10:44,771 --> 00:10:46,230
If you find anything,

105
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:49,067
you raise your hand
and you shout, "Here!"

106
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:52,820
It’s very important
that you touch nothing.

107
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:54,155
Understood?

108
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:55,364
All right.

109
00:10:57,033 --> 00:11:00,244
Thank you all for coming.
Take your positions, please.

110
00:11:00,286 --> 00:11:03,539
Where do you want us? You can stand
here, at the end of this line.

111
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:04,957
Thank you.

112
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:06,709
Two meters, two meters.

113
00:11:16,219 --> 00:11:19,347
Kennis! Let’s go!

114
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:25,728
Ethan! Ethan!

115
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,398
- Ethan!

116
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:33,236
Ethan! Ethan!

117
00:11:33,903 --> 00:11:36,322
Ethan! Ethan!

118
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,542
Ethan!

119
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:55,550
Ethan!

120
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,137
Ethan!

121
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,537
Ethan!

122
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:49,145
Who’s she?
Inspector Roy can tell you.

123
00:12:49,187 --> 00:12:50,605
Please, come with me.

124
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:56,736
How you doing?
Mr. Murray. Please.

125
00:12:56,778 --> 00:12:59,530
Is there any news?
Nothing, as yet.

126
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:02,325
How are you coping?

127
00:13:06,204 --> 00:13:09,165
I’ve... I’ve known
better days, you know?

128
00:13:12,043 --> 00:13:14,629
Allow me to tell
you where we are.

129
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:17,173
The alert plan
has been triggered

130
00:13:17,215 --> 00:13:19,509
since yesterday morning. Good.

131
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:24,222
We continue to interview everybody who
has come into contact with your son.

132
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:27,183
Now, the supervising
staff at the camp,

133
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:31,729
they tell me that they would do regular
checks of the tents and the pods,

134
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:35,733
to make sure that the children
were asleep and all was well.

135
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:39,028
The last check took place
at 1:00 in the morning.

136
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,571
And he was in there?

137
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:44,033
He was in there. At that
point, everything was fine.

138
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:48,913
When I looked at his cabin,

139
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:52,417
I could see his clothes were still
in there, his bag was still in there.

140
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,460
His little snacks
were still in there.

141
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:56,838
Now, Mr. Murray,

142
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,091
I have to tell you that we’re
investigating every hypothesis,

143
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:02,218
including kidnapping.

144
00:14:05,096 --> 00:14:07,056
Now, allow me to ask you
a number of questions.

145
00:14:07,098 --> 00:14:12,228
You may find some of these questions
unsettling, intimate. May I?

146
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,772
No, don’t worry. You can
ask me whatever you want.

147
00:14:14,814 --> 00:14:18,568
First of all, I understand that
you’ve been traveling a great deal.

148
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:22,697
You’ve been in Libya, Saudi
Arabia, Iraq. Why is that?

149
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:24,240
My work’s international.

150
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:26,242
I’ve been working abroad
for the last ten years,

151
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:28,119
um, give or take.

152
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:32,373
I work in the oil fields, and
I go wherever they send me.

153
00:14:32,415 --> 00:14:35,626
Would you say your business,
your work was dangerous?

154
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:37,462
The work, in itself,
is not dangerous.

155
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:40,214
You can sometimes be in places
where you are in danger.

156
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:43,092
And I am constantly aware,
when I’m in certain places,

157
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:44,594
that I need to watch my back.

158
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:47,597
Have any of these things
affected you, Mr. Murray?

159
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:49,599
Ah...

160
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,185
A subordinate of mine
was taken hostage.

161
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:54,604
We went through a whole
fiasco trying to get him back.

162
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:59,609
It was a fucking mess. And we
ended up paying the hostage ransom.

163
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:01,986
Sir...

164
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,329
Oh, come on. If you’ve got something
to say, you can say it in English.

165
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,248
I’d like to ask you
for your mobile phone.

166
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,711
We need it for the purposes of the
investigation, to retrieve the contacts.

167
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,635
It’s procedure. I’m not
supposed to give my phone out.

168
00:15:27,095 --> 00:15:31,641
I’m sure you can appreciate the
importance of this, at this point in time.

169
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,267
I completely can.

170
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:37,772
The nature of my work means
there’s sensitive material on here.

171
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:41,651
You just need my
contacts? Yes.

172
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,281
Thank you.

173
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:54,414
It would be fair to say that most
of the countries where you work

174
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:58,418
would be unsuitable to take a
child to, yes? Most of them, yes.

175
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:00,920
The hours that I work, and the
far-flung places I end up in,

176
00:16:00,962 --> 00:16:04,215
even if they aren’t insecure,
aren’t suitable for taking a child.

177
00:16:04,257 --> 00:16:06,527
I can’t take him all over the
world. He’s got to be in school.

178
00:16:06,551 --> 00:16:08,845
He’s got to have his friends,
got to have some stability.

179
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:11,556
He’s got to have a house, a
family. And I can’t offer him that.

180
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:15,351
When did you last see your son?

181
00:16:26,404 --> 00:16:28,573
I saw him at Christmas
time. I saw him...

182
00:16:29,782 --> 00:16:32,368
I saw him on Skype
at Christmas time.

183
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,496
He seemed fine.

184
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:44,589
Do you have a good
relationship with your ex-wife?

185
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,591
It’s
not... It’s not bad.

186
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:50,261
It’s not her fault we split up.

187
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,767
Is there any antagonism?

188
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:02,857
From me, none.

189
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:19,082
Do you have any
contact with her new partner?

190
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:23,378
I’ve seen him on Skype
a few times. He seems fine.

191
00:17:24,462 --> 00:17:26,631
Have you security checked him?

192
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:29,092
Because isn’t it well known
that nine times out of ten,

193
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:33,471
it’s someone you know,
someone in your family?

194
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:39,602
This is the case, which is why
it’s part of our primary investigation.

195
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:44,565
And you? Is there
someone new in your life?

196
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:46,984
Yes. Yes,
I have a partner.

197
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:50,196
I’ve been seeing
her for five years.

198
00:17:56,285 --> 00:18:00,331
Two years ago, your wife
told you that your son was unwell.

199
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:05,128
I came back and we
went away together for a month.

200
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:06,671
We had a cracking time.

201
00:18:06,713 --> 00:18:08,881
We went all over North America.

202
00:18:10,258 --> 00:18:11,801
And...

203
00:18:15,972 --> 00:18:17,557
And then I went back to work.

204
00:18:20,351 --> 00:18:21,978
Do you have reason to believe

205
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:24,689
that it’s because of what I
do that Ethan has been taken?

206
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:33,656
I have reason to believe
that somebody made a decision

207
00:18:33,698 --> 00:18:37,535
to choose your son and
not the other child.

208
00:18:40,371 --> 00:18:45,668
That’s why I’m asking you these
questions, Mr. Murray. Why Ethan?

209
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,796
Why him? Why not the other boy?

210
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:53,384
Unfortunately, all you can do
at this point in time is wait.

211
00:18:53,426 --> 00:18:55,720
Wait for us to contact you.

212
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:52,568
How you doing?  Edmond.

213
00:19:53,361 --> 00:19:55,071
Nice to see you. Come in.

214
00:19:55,113 --> 00:19:56,489
All right. Thank you.

215
00:19:59,784 --> 00:20:02,745
Joan? Where’s Joan? Ah...

216
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:05,373
She... She’s resting. Sit
down. You want a whiskey?

217
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:07,500
Aye. Sure, thank you.

218
00:20:08,626 --> 00:20:10,753
Brutal weather outside,
eh?

219
00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:13,673
Uh-huh. Apparently,
it’s going to be...

220
00:20:14,841 --> 00:20:16,968
It’s going to be an
early winter, apparently.

221
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:21,013
I mean, that’s what, you
know, the locals are saying.

222
00:20:21,055 --> 00:20:22,724
All the old people.

223
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:26,561
But no one fucking believes
them anymore, do they?

224
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:30,565
They just believe the...
the fucking Internet.

225
00:20:31,482 --> 00:20:32,734
Slainte.

226
00:20:37,155 --> 00:20:38,614
Joan’s just...

227
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,452
She really broke down tonight.

228
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:44,829
You know, I just think
it really fucking...

229
00:20:44,871 --> 00:20:47,123
really hit her. I
know. Fair enough.

230
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:49,476
So I’ve just given her a little
something to help her sleep.

231
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,586
So hopefully she’ll
get a full night,

232
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,337
so I’m not gonna...
What did you give her?

233
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,424
Fuck. I don’t know
the name of it. Um...

234
00:20:57,925 --> 00:21:01,804
I... I struggle with
sleep occasionally

235
00:21:01,846 --> 00:21:04,223
and I got a prescription
fucking ages ago but...

236
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:06,601
How long has she been
asleep for, with that?

237
00:21:07,185 --> 00:21:09,062
Um...

238
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:13,149
About an hour and a half
ago, something like that.

239
00:21:13,191 --> 00:21:16,402
But I don’t think... I don’t think
I should wake her up, really.

240
00:21:16,444 --> 00:21:17,695
She needs the rest.

241
00:21:17,737 --> 00:21:19,697
Nothing to worry about. Okay.

242
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:22,366
Yeah. It’s not
a regular thing.

243
00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:25,620
In the circumstances... All
right, man. All right. Yep.

244
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,876
So what are you...

245
00:21:31,918 --> 00:21:34,837
What’s going to happen with your
work? What are you going to do?

246
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:37,507
Ah, work can wait.

247
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:40,510
It’s easy for me, really, ’cause I
work for myself. I set up a business.

248
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:42,678
I’ve got this construction
company and...

249
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,099
I mean, it’s, you know, small but
I’ve had it for about 15 years.

250
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,517
I started in my early 20s.

251
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:50,311
Based here? International?

252
00:21:50,353 --> 00:21:52,730
No. No, I’m not like you. No.

253
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:55,858
No, I... I want to stay here.

254
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,820
Local, really. It’s
small, you know.

255
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:01,572
I started it myself. It
was a grind, believe me.

256
00:22:01,614 --> 00:22:03,783
But now I’ve recruited
enough people

257
00:22:03,825 --> 00:22:06,160
that it just kind of runs
itself, which is great.

258
00:22:06,202 --> 00:22:10,665
So I can now essentially just be
here, be there for Joan and...

259
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,668
Nothing more important
than that, eh?

260
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:17,046
She’s fucking amazing, man.

261
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:20,299
Have you heard anything?
Has anybody called or...

262
00:22:20,341 --> 00:22:21,551
Today? Uh-huh.

263
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:25,346
What about? The
searches? No, no.

264
00:22:25,388 --> 00:22:29,684
To be honest with you, my focus
is really on her, you know.

265
00:22:29,726 --> 00:22:31,602
I’m just focusing on her.

266
00:22:31,644 --> 00:22:35,732
No. I’m actually just going to
switch my phone off for a bit.

267
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:37,859
Is that a good idea?

268
00:22:38,818 --> 00:22:41,487
Well, you’re here. You’ve
got your phone on, no?

269
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:43,990
I just wanted to have
a conversation...

270
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:45,450
Yeah. No, no.

271
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,871
I just don’t want
to be disturbed.

272
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:57,346
So where are you going
to stay? Joan said you

273
00:22:57,378 --> 00:22:59,338
don’t really have anywhere
around here anymore.

274
00:23:00,465 --> 00:23:03,801
Don’t worry about me, Frank. I’ll
be fine. I’ll find something.

275
00:23:03,843 --> 00:23:07,180
Why don’t you stay at Joan’s? I mean, it’s
technically your... your place, as well.

276
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:10,058
Aye. Well, if you’re
not going to be there...

277
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:13,436
Listen, I understand that you
and Joan might need some space.

278
00:23:13,478 --> 00:23:15,813
No, look, it’s... Time
together. I can... I can escape.

279
00:23:15,855 --> 00:23:19,192
My parents... I inherited this little
shack in the middle of fucking nowhere.

280
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:23,654
I can go and, you know,
get out of the way.

281
00:23:24,781 --> 00:23:26,699
I’m selling it, actually.

282
00:23:26,741 --> 00:23:30,536
Because, following in your footsteps,
I found this unbelievable bit of land,

283
00:23:30,578 --> 00:23:32,538
and now we’re going
to build a house,

284
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,998
and it’s just so beautiful.

285
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,584
Joan loves it. The
light is amazing.

286
00:23:36,626 --> 00:23:39,003
Actually, can I... Can
I show you something?

287
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:43,716
Here, come into the
kitchen. Come on.

288
00:23:43,758 --> 00:23:48,054
So these got delivered today,
actually. I was just looking over them.

289
00:23:48,096 --> 00:23:51,349
So, I’ve been working with this
architect. He works in my company.

290
00:23:51,391 --> 00:23:55,311
So he’s designing it
with me, and Joan also.

291
00:23:55,353 --> 00:23:57,605
So this is the outside of
the house. The sea is here.

292
00:23:57,647 --> 00:24:00,691
And we’ve got all the light
here. It’s beautiful. Glass here.

293
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:02,443
Actually, I think
I want a bit more.

294
00:24:02,485 --> 00:24:05,488
But then this is the top floor.
We’ve got our bedroom here.

295
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:08,616
Lots of light for Joan. It’s
going to be unbelievable.

296
00:24:08,658 --> 00:24:13,663
And then down here is the basement. Just
don’t really know what to do with it.

297
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:16,290
Maybe... Maybe a
games room or...

298
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:19,961
Be careful. What do you think?

299
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:22,255
Are you actually
fucking kidding me?

300
00:24:24,215 --> 00:24:25,383
Um...

301
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:27,844
Where’s Ethan’s room?

302
00:24:29,137 --> 00:24:30,304
Okay...

303
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:33,057
Are you putting him
in the basement?

304
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:34,851
No, we’re not putting
him in the basement.

305
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:36,894
I can see that you’re
angry and upset... Joan!

306
00:24:36,936 --> 00:24:38,563
Hey, hey, hey!
She’s asleep. No.

307
00:24:38,604 --> 00:24:40,273
She’s asleep. I
need to talk to her.

308
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:41,524
Hey. I need to talk to her.

309
00:24:41,566 --> 00:24:43,025
Why? She’s asleep.

310
00:24:43,067 --> 00:24:45,111
’Cause my fucking son’s missing.

311
00:24:45,153 --> 00:24:48,948
Yeah, I’m aware of that. I’m
aware that your son’s missing.

312
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,909
He’s also my son. I
love him very much.

313
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:54,203
Don’t. Fucking
don’t. Don’t what?

314
00:24:54,245 --> 00:24:56,664
Don’t tell me he’s your son,
as well. Well, let’s be honest.

315
00:24:56,706 --> 00:25:00,001
He’s been... He’s been more my son than
he has yours the last year, hasn’t he?

316
00:25:00,043 --> 00:25:02,563
You’re a very fucking weird man!
What have you done with my son?

317
00:25:02,587 --> 00:25:05,274
I’ve done nothing with your son. What
the fuck have you done with my son?

318
00:25:05,298 --> 00:25:07,592
I love your son! What
the fuck have you done?

319
00:25:16,976 --> 00:25:21,064
Inspector Roy,
you need to come over here.

320
00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:23,066
I’m at Joan’s rented
accommodation.

321
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:26,402
I’m here with her partner,
Frank. He’s unconscious.

322
00:25:26,444 --> 00:25:28,446
He’s been high as a kite.
He’s given her drugs.

323
00:25:28,488 --> 00:25:30,531
And he knows something. He
fucking knows something.

324
00:25:30,573 --> 00:25:33,701
Please call me back at this
number as soon as you can.

325
00:25:43,127 --> 00:25:45,671
-Get the fuck off!
-Get in the van! Get in the van!

326
00:25:45,713 --> 00:25:49,092
Please, you’re making a mistake!
You’re making a big mistake!

327
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:52,011
Hey, there’s a picture in the
bag. Just give it to Joan!

328
00:25:52,053 --> 00:25:54,722
Just get in the van!
You’re making a mistake!

329
00:25:56,015 --> 00:25:57,850
What? Section 1 of the
Criminal Justice Act...

330
00:25:57,892 --> 00:26:00,311
You don’t understand.
The man has taken my son.

331
00:26:00,353 --> 00:26:03,398
Or he’s done something to my son, or he
fucking knows something about my son.

332
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:04,690
You’ve gotta go back there!

333
00:26:04,732 --> 00:26:06,192
You take me to fucking jail,

334
00:26:06,234 --> 00:26:07,819
and you’re taking
him to the hospital?

335
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,487
Do you understand?

336
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:11,489
You’re having a fucking laugh!

337
00:26:11,531 --> 00:26:15,785
Informed of your arrest and
you’ll have access to a solicitor.

338
00:26:15,827 --> 00:26:17,703
These rights... Fuck!

339
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:20,957
Will be explained to you further
once we arrive at the police station.

340
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:24,711
I suggest you make yourself
comfortable, Mr. Murray.

341
00:26:24,752 --> 00:26:26,921
I don’t care how fucking
badly he is hurt.

342
00:26:26,963 --> 00:26:30,341
The minute he wakes up, you need to
ask him what he’s done with my son.

343
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,266
You’re not going
to say anything?

344
00:26:38,766 --> 00:26:40,017
Nothing?

345
00:26:41,811 --> 00:26:43,980
My son’s missing!

346
00:26:46,357 --> 00:26:48,860
My son’s missing!

347
00:26:54,198 --> 00:26:55,742
Fuck.

348
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:28,024
That’s my wallet.

349
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:32,445
That’s... They’re
actually Joan’s keys.

350
00:27:32,487 --> 00:27:35,281
That’s Frank’s phone.
That’s my phone.

351
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:37,033
You want to put
that somewhere else?

352
00:27:37,075 --> 00:27:38,951
Put it in there, please.

353
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:40,995
That could be evidence.

354
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:46,417
Make yourself at home.

355
00:28:03,351 --> 00:28:04,769
All right.

356
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:15,488
Obviously, you’ll be held in
custody until the morning.

357
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:18,241
I’ll come back then and we’ll
see what’s to happen to you.

358
00:28:18,282 --> 00:28:19,927
I’m really sorry about
everything that happened.

359
00:28:19,951 --> 00:28:21,411
But have you spoken to him yet?

360
00:28:21,452 --> 00:28:22,930
I have to impress
upon you, Mr. Murray,

361
00:28:22,954 --> 00:28:25,248
you’re wasting our time now.

362
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:28,167
Every hour is critical, and
you’re wasting our time.

363
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:30,128
There’s something not
right about that guy.

364
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:31,921
The day after my wee
boy’s gone missing,

365
00:28:31,963 --> 00:28:33,673
he’s showing me
blueprints of some house

366
00:28:33,715 --> 00:28:37,218
that he wants to move into with
my wife... my... my ex-wife.

367
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:41,264
And he doesn’t have a room
in that house for my son.

368
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:45,101
Either he knows something or
he’s criminally a fucking prick.

369
00:28:45,143 --> 00:28:47,603
Please, Joan’s taking
Valium and going to sleep.

370
00:28:47,645 --> 00:28:49,355
I have known that woman.

371
00:28:49,397 --> 00:28:52,233
She’s a good mother and
she would not take anything

372
00:28:52,275 --> 00:28:54,110
that would stop her
answering that phone.

373
00:28:54,152 --> 00:28:56,362
She would be up checking
that phone every 15 minutes.

374
00:28:56,404 --> 00:29:00,032
So I am really sorry. I apologize.
I’m not going to talk anymore.

375
00:29:00,074 --> 00:29:04,328
But please, just
treat him seriously.

376
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:09,375
You’re not stable right now.
I’m telling you straight.

377
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:13,838
You’re in no position to tell me
how to conduct this investigation.

378
00:29:15,882 --> 00:29:17,175
I’ll see you.

379
00:29:21,554 --> 00:29:23,347
It’s my wee boy...

380
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:34,317
Mr. Gilchrist
is still in hospital.

381
00:29:34,358 --> 00:29:37,987
He has two fractured ribs.
He has a dislocated hip.

382
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:41,324
Nonetheless, he’s decided not
to press charges against you.

383
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:44,702
Were you
able to talk to him?

384
00:29:44,744 --> 00:29:47,538
I’ve communicated with him. I
have taken a similar position.

385
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,958
I’m not going to take this
any further, Mr. Murray.

386
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,669
One of my colleagues
has retrieved your car.

387
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:55,296
It’s at the station here.

388
00:29:55,338 --> 00:29:58,299
You’re letting me go?
You’re no longer in custody.

389
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:03,304
You don’t think it’s weird that
he’s not going to press charges?

390
00:30:03,346 --> 00:30:08,351
Mr. Murray, I’ll explain
something very significant to you,

391
00:30:08,393 --> 00:30:11,187
to help you clear your
mind of all of this.

392
00:30:11,229 --> 00:30:14,899
One month ago, your wife
suffered a miscarriage.

393
00:30:16,776 --> 00:30:19,529
What? Yes.

394
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,657
I’m telling you this, so that
you can understand the situation,

395
00:30:22,698 --> 00:30:28,663
the predicament of both Ms.
Richmond and Frank Gilchrist.

396
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:31,499
Now, this was a very difficult
thing for her to deal with.

397
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:35,920
In fact, this is the reason that she
decided to send your son to the camp.

398
00:30:35,962 --> 00:30:41,634
So that she could get some calm,
some peace, to deal with this.

399
00:30:41,676 --> 00:30:44,804
It was nothing to do
with Mr. Gilchrist.

400
00:30:44,846 --> 00:30:46,180
Is she all right?

401
00:30:46,222 --> 00:30:49,976
In these circumstances, no.

402
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:54,522
And I understand that this is a
very difficult period for you.

403
00:30:54,564 --> 00:30:57,817
I’d like to offer you
psychological support.

404
00:30:57,859 --> 00:30:59,402
You need to go home.

405
00:31:00,445 --> 00:31:02,488
You need to clear
your head of this,

406
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:05,366
to allow us to go on
with the investigation.

407
00:31:06,868 --> 00:31:08,327
No, I’m fine.

408
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:10,580
I won’t be any more
problem to you, I promise.

409
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:13,291
Thank you. Thank you
for your patience.

410
00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:04,926
Hi, this is Leah.
Leave me a message. Thank you.

411
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:08,262
Leah,
it’s Edmond. Um...

412
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:14,268
I’m here. I’m sorry I’ve
not checked in earlier.

413
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,938
I got in a bit of trouble
with the police last night.

414
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:19,023
I’m fine. I’m absolutely fine.

415
00:32:21,526 --> 00:32:23,736
And we haven’t heard
anything about...

416
00:32:25,405 --> 00:32:27,657
what’s happened to Ethan yet.

417
00:32:30,368 --> 00:32:33,121
Could you tell the company I’m
really sorry I haven’t checked in?

418
00:32:33,162 --> 00:32:36,541
Can you do that for me? Tell them
I’m okay and I’ll be in touch soon.

419
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:38,751
Um...

420
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:40,712
I love you.

421
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,221
If you get this call, just
please call me back, okay?

422
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:22,378
Joan! Joan?

423
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:07,465
Joan.

424
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,388
You okay?

425
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:15,098
Have they found him?

426
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:17,433
No. Not yet.

427
00:34:21,938 --> 00:34:23,314
Joan.

428
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:27,443
I’m really sorry for
what happened to you.

429
00:34:29,737 --> 00:34:31,155
What do you mean?

430
00:34:32,824 --> 00:34:34,575
About your wee baby.

431
00:34:36,327 --> 00:34:39,038
I’m very sorry.
Who told you that?

432
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,332
Inspector Roy. He
was trying to...

433
00:34:41,374 --> 00:34:45,378
Well, he’s got no fucking
right to tell you that.

434
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,965
I know you guys were going through a
very difficult time, even before this.

435
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:50,258
Fuck off.

436
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:55,596
Was it hard for Ethan?

437
00:34:56,347 --> 00:34:58,182
’Cause he said that you...

438
00:34:58,933 --> 00:35:00,017
I...

439
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:02,270
You needed peace and...

440
00:35:08,234 --> 00:35:10,361
I mean, this is bad
enough, as it is.

441
00:35:10,403 --> 00:35:12,697
I don’t know what you’re
trying to do to me.

442
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:15,408
I’m not trying to do anything.

443
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:17,618
He didn’t...

444
00:35:19,537 --> 00:35:21,539
He didn’t want me
to have a baby.

445
00:35:23,374 --> 00:35:26,669
Ethan? No, of
course he didn’t.

446
00:35:29,464 --> 00:35:31,549
Does that make you
happy? That he hated it?

447
00:35:31,591 --> 00:35:32,759
No.

448
00:35:33,718 --> 00:35:36,179
’Cause he fucking
hated the idea.

449
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:39,098
He hated that
Frank had moved in.

450
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:44,103
And he hated the fact that
you weren’t here anymore.

451
00:35:44,145 --> 00:35:48,232
And the only person he could talk to
about it was me, because you weren’t here.

452
00:35:48,274 --> 00:35:51,694
So I had to deal with our son
being upset about something

453
00:35:51,736 --> 00:35:53,738
that I was really happy about.

454
00:35:56,407 --> 00:35:58,409
I’m really sorry about that.

455
00:36:01,204 --> 00:36:02,747
Where were you last night?

456
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,087
I was in the police station.
They just let me out.

457
00:36:09,128 --> 00:36:11,798
They said Frank’s not
going to press any charges.

458
00:36:14,258 --> 00:36:16,260
He fucking should.

459
00:36:16,302 --> 00:36:18,721
Did he give you
Valium last night?

460
00:36:21,808 --> 00:36:22,934
Yeah.

461
00:36:24,227 --> 00:36:27,271
I’ve never known you to
take a pill in your life.

462
00:36:28,564 --> 00:36:30,608
Well, you don’t know me anymore.

463
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:34,153
Okay.

464
00:36:34,195 --> 00:36:36,406
I thought you were going
to say you were sorry.

465
00:36:36,447 --> 00:36:38,199
That’s what I thought
you were going to say.

466
00:36:38,241 --> 00:36:41,577
I thought you were going to
say sorry for beating the shit

467
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:43,371
out of my boyfriend.

468
00:36:43,413 --> 00:36:45,623
You know, he never
even mentioned Ethan.

469
00:36:45,665 --> 00:36:48,668
He’s all excited about his blueprints
for his new house that’s he’s building.

470
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,920
Yeah, we were really
excited about that!

471
00:36:50,962 --> 00:36:53,273
We were really excited about that.
Ethan was excited about that.

472
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:56,259
And we all talked about it together,
as a family. Me, him and Frank.

473
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:00,513
We all sat down and we discussed it.
That’s what we do. That’s my family.

474
00:37:00,555 --> 00:37:02,682
And you’d know that if
you asked about him,

475
00:37:02,724 --> 00:37:04,684
if you asked your son about him.

476
00:37:04,726 --> 00:37:06,102
But you don’t, do you?

477
00:37:06,144 --> 00:37:07,437
Because you never fucking call

478
00:37:07,478 --> 00:37:09,272
and you never
fucking do anything.

479
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:11,941
You sent a present on
his seventh birthday.

480
00:37:11,983 --> 00:37:15,570
He doesn’t even get the
chance to talk to his dad.

481
00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:21,242
Have you even thought
about what this all means?

482
00:37:21,284 --> 00:37:22,869
That your son’s missing?

483
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,954
All I’ve been thinking
about this whole time

484
00:37:24,996 --> 00:37:27,457
is that I’m a bad mother, that
I’ve done something wrong.

485
00:37:27,498 --> 00:37:31,544
Have you even thought for a fucking
second what sort of father you are?

486
00:37:31,586 --> 00:37:35,339
What sort of father
you’ve been to your son?

487
00:37:35,381 --> 00:37:37,175
I know, I know. I
know I’m a bad dad.

488
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:40,845
I know I’m never here. I
know he can’t rely on me.

489
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:46,267
But it’s not my fault he’s
gone missing, darling.

490
00:37:51,147 --> 00:37:53,357
I just... Hey, hey!

491
00:37:53,399 --> 00:37:55,485
Stop and think for a minute.

492
00:37:55,526 --> 00:37:59,363
Just think of what
we need you to do.

493
00:38:00,198 --> 00:38:02,116
Frank is not...

494
00:38:02,158 --> 00:38:07,580
He’s a beautiful, strong,
amazing man who loves your son.

495
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,375
I don’t believe that.

496
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,971
Right.

497
00:39:14,772 --> 00:39:17,984
Why do you think that my
phone is being tapped?

498
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:22,572
Listen. At 2:00 this afternoon,
I got a call from Glasgow.

499
00:39:22,613 --> 00:39:25,116
They asked me to
come off this case.

500
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:30,997
I said, "Why? Why should
I drop this file? Why?

501
00:39:31,038 --> 00:39:36,711
You must send me a written explanation
why I should drop this file."

502
00:39:36,753 --> 00:39:40,840
And they yell at me, shout
at me. And I hung up.

503
00:39:40,882 --> 00:39:45,386
At 2:17, I get a call,
this time from London.

504
00:39:45,428 --> 00:39:47,597
From Sir Patrick Nelson.

505
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:52,101
This man, he’s higher up than anybody
in the police force in Scotland.

506
00:39:52,143 --> 00:39:55,104
And he tells me this case
will be handled from London.

507
00:39:55,146 --> 00:39:57,106
This time, I get a
chance to say nothing.

508
00:39:57,148 --> 00:40:02,070
He tells me that this is in
everyone’s best interests.

509
00:40:02,111 --> 00:40:03,696
And that’s it.

510
00:40:03,738 --> 00:40:08,576
At 3:00, I tell my team we’re
no longer involved. And I leave.

511
00:40:08,618 --> 00:40:14,165
I didn’t have much faith in a kidnapping
related to your work in the oil industry.

512
00:40:14,207 --> 00:40:15,958
I could be wrong.

513
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,253
London must have some
information that I don’t have.

514
00:40:19,921 --> 00:40:21,672
But I’ll tell you this.

515
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:28,137
You’re on your own. Basically,
you’re on your own, Mr. Murray.

516
00:40:28,179 --> 00:40:31,557
I can’t stay. Don’t
use your phone.

517
00:40:32,141 --> 00:40:33,226
Thank you.

518
00:41:32,493 --> 00:41:34,245
Come on, darling. Pick up.

519
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,918
-  Hello?
- Leah?

520
00:41:43,755 --> 00:41:45,757
- Can you hear me?
- What’s this number?

521
00:41:45,798 --> 00:41:47,467
What’s this number
you’re phoning on?

522
00:41:47,508 --> 00:41:48,968
It’s not my phone.

523
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,554
Listen to me, listen
to me, listen to me.

524
00:41:51,596 --> 00:41:54,432
No, you listen to me. Do you have
any idea what’s been going on here?

525
00:41:54,474 --> 00:41:57,727
Do you know the cops came into the office?
They turned the whole place upside down.

526
00:41:57,769 --> 00:42:01,439
They’ve got the computers. They’ve got the
hard drives. They’ve got everything, Edmond.

527
00:42:01,481 --> 00:42:04,192
- Do you understand what this means?
- What?

528
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:07,820
They’ve got all the files. I
mean, they’ve got the Iraq files.

529
00:42:07,862 --> 00:42:09,530
I mean, Jesus!

530
00:42:09,572 --> 00:42:12,867
Has anybody mentioned my name?
Has anybody been looking for me?

531
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:16,746
Listen to me. Listen
to me, Edmond, okay?

532
00:42:16,788 --> 00:42:20,249
I’ve gotta tell you this. Don’t
call me again. Do you understand?

533
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:22,752
-Leah...
-Do you understand? I’m sorry.

534
00:42:53,658 --> 00:42:56,536
- Can I take it off?
- Yeah, sure.

535
00:42:56,577 --> 00:42:59,414
-  Oh, my God!
- Joan.

536
00:43:00,415 --> 00:43:02,875
That is not what I
was expecting at all.

537
00:43:04,293 --> 00:43:06,879
What do you
think? It’s amazing, eh?

538
00:43:06,921 --> 00:43:12,260
- It’s amazing.
- I know! We can build a house along here.

539
00:43:12,301 --> 00:43:16,055
I was thinking this is where,
you know, if you wanted to...

540
00:43:17,056 --> 00:43:20,768
we could, you know,
start a family.

541
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:22,228
Yeah.

542
00:43:24,147 --> 00:43:28,234
Yeah! I want to, yeah.

543
00:43:28,276 --> 00:43:31,529
-  Well, I love you very much.
-  I love you.

544
00:43:31,571 --> 00:43:33,740
You clever, clever man.

545
00:43:42,999 --> 00:43:45,710
Ready? Make a wish!

546
00:43:45,752 --> 00:43:48,755
Three, two, one! Come on!

547
00:43:52,842 --> 00:43:55,887
One more, one more, one
more. Come on, come on, come on!

548
00:43:55,928 --> 00:43:57,972
Come on, come on!
Don’t leave me hanging!

549
00:43:58,014 --> 00:44:00,641
-  Yay!

550
00:44:04,896 --> 00:44:06,147
Do you like it?

551
00:44:12,403 --> 00:44:15,740
Okay, okay. Let’s
open the big one now.

552
00:44:15,782 --> 00:44:17,033
This is the one.

553
00:44:17,075 --> 00:44:19,285
This is from Daddy,

554
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,746
who wishes he could be here,
but he can’t be here today.

555
00:44:21,788 --> 00:44:23,748
This is from Dad.

556
00:44:34,342 --> 00:44:37,553
-  Oh, my God.
-  Oh, my goodness.

557
00:44:37,595 --> 00:44:41,265
What’s that?
It’s a helicopter.

558
00:44:41,307 --> 00:44:44,811
Isn’t that amazing? Yeah?

559
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:48,898
Ethan, how do you like
your present from your dad?

560
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:52,902
Yeah? Good present? All right!

561
00:44:54,237 --> 00:44:56,447
You’re doing really good.

562
00:44:57,115 --> 00:44:59,075
You’re a good mum.

563
00:44:59,117 --> 00:45:00,910
You are a good mother.

564
00:45:02,912 --> 00:45:04,414
A rocket!

565
00:45:04,455 --> 00:45:06,749
Whoa!

566
00:45:12,797 --> 00:45:15,049
Oh, my God!

567
00:45:17,927 --> 00:45:19,554
You got that?

568
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:22,932
Ethan! You having
fun? Are you happy?

569
00:45:22,974 --> 00:45:24,851
You having a good birthday?

570
00:45:33,651 --> 00:45:39,115
Look, Ethan! Look! What do you
think? It’s pretty cool, eh?

571
00:45:40,324 --> 00:45:42,410
You’re going to be
hanging out with that guy.

572
00:45:42,452 --> 00:45:46,330
Hey? Look at that!

573
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,001
Hi, guys! How you doing?

574
00:45:50,043 --> 00:45:51,502
Yeah, sure.

575
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:55,006
You want to say
goodbye to your pal?

576
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,967
See ya!

577
00:45:59,385 --> 00:46:01,721
Are you all ready
for this, junior astronauts?

578
00:46:01,763 --> 00:46:03,931
- Yeah!
-  That’s what I like to hear!

579
00:46:03,973 --> 00:46:06,642
Okay, so, just to let
you know, Mums and Dads,

580
00:46:06,684 --> 00:46:09,896
before you head off, we’ve
got loads of busy days...

581
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:22,700
Love you. You’ll
be all right, okay?

582
00:46:23,701 --> 00:46:26,996
Just try and enjoy it.
You’ll have a great time.

583
00:46:27,038 --> 00:46:29,832
Say bye-bye to
them, Mums and Dads.

584
00:46:29,874 --> 00:46:32,001
I love you, darling.

585
00:46:32,043 --> 00:46:35,755
Bye, Ethan
buddy! Have fun!

586
00:46:38,299 --> 00:46:40,009
Bye, Ethan!

587
00:46:48,601 --> 00:46:50,812
There we go.

588
00:46:50,853 --> 00:46:54,440
The first... The first
time he’s slept away from home.

589
00:46:54,482 --> 00:46:58,069
- Bye, darling! Love you!
-  Bye, Ethan!

590
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:08,621
Come on, give
us a wave. Bye, bud!

591
00:47:46,409 --> 00:47:48,202
Go on, Ethan!

592
00:47:56,085 --> 00:47:58,838
Go, go, go!
Come over here.

593
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,423
Go, go, go!

594
00:48:01,382 --> 00:48:03,301
- Who wants a balloon?
-  Me!

595
00:48:12,435 --> 00:48:14,020
They’re all tangled up.

596
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:38,544
They’re going to
be well-fed. They’re...

597
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,674
Astronomy camp...

598
00:48:44,258 --> 00:48:45,510
Have fun!

599
00:49:40,064 --> 00:49:41,607
Hi, are you okay?

600
00:49:44,068 --> 00:49:45,111
Frank?

601
00:49:45,903 --> 00:49:50,158
Hey, Joan. It’s
not Frank. It’s me.

602
00:49:52,076 --> 00:49:54,888
- Why are you calling me on Frank’s phone?
- I took it off him last night.

603
00:49:54,912 --> 00:49:57,057
The police thought it was mine,
so they gave it back to me.

604
00:49:57,081 --> 00:50:00,126
Please, before you get angry
with me, can you listen to me?

605
00:50:00,168 --> 00:50:02,628
Can I come over?
I’ll give you...

606
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:03,755
Why?

607
00:50:06,257 --> 00:50:08,217
I think I’ve found something.

608
00:50:13,264 --> 00:50:16,184
You’re going to be
hanging out with that guy, eh?

609
00:50:16,225 --> 00:50:18,144
Isn’t that amazing?

610
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:20,748
Want to say
goodbye to your pal?

611
00:50:20,772 --> 00:50:22,857
I can’t watch this. Why
are we watching this?

612
00:50:22,899 --> 00:50:24,275
See ya!

613
00:50:26,569 --> 00:50:28,696
Just have a look at this.

614
00:50:30,782 --> 00:50:32,200
The same car?

615
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:35,244
Two different places,
two different times,

616
00:50:35,286 --> 00:50:36,829
and the common
factor being our son.

617
00:50:36,871 --> 00:50:38,998
Well, the common
factor’s not our son.

618
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,920
The common factor is that he was at a
birthday party with all his friends,

619
00:50:41,959 --> 00:50:45,546
and then he went to adventure
camp with all his friends.

620
00:50:45,588 --> 00:50:48,716
So that’s... It’s probably
just one of the parents’ cars.

621
00:50:48,758 --> 00:50:51,844
That’s fine, that’s fine. Worst-case
scenario, I’ll turn up at his mate’s house

622
00:50:51,886 --> 00:50:54,764
and I’ll get a sympathetic cup
of tea with some innocent dad.

623
00:50:56,224 --> 00:50:58,267
I think you need to
call your brother.

624
00:50:59,227 --> 00:51:00,853
Oh, fuck...

625
00:51:00,895 --> 00:51:03,231
Call your brother. He
still works in insurance.

626
00:51:03,272 --> 00:51:06,734
He’ll be able to get the license plate.
He’ll be able to get the home address.

627
00:51:06,776 --> 00:51:08,653
Yeah, illegally.

628
00:51:08,694 --> 00:51:11,489
I still think... I still think we
should call the police. I can’t...

629
00:51:11,531 --> 00:51:13,950
I told you before...
I know! I can’t...

630
00:51:13,991 --> 00:51:18,287
We are on our own. Darling,
we are all that Ethan’s got.

631
00:51:18,329 --> 00:51:20,623
Those were Inspector
Roy’s last words to me.

632
00:51:23,543 --> 00:51:26,546
Call your brother. Now.

633
00:51:28,506 --> 00:51:31,175
They might have already
moved him. Fine, fine!

634
00:51:37,348 --> 00:51:38,683
Go, go, go.

635
00:51:40,727 --> 00:51:44,856
Rob, Hi. No, I’m sorry.
I’m sorry it’s so early.

636
00:51:44,897 --> 00:51:48,484
Yeah, I know. No.
Nothing yet, no. Um...

637
00:51:48,526 --> 00:51:52,613
Look, I need you to do
something for me, if you can.

638
00:51:55,908 --> 00:51:58,953
I don’t know, it looks like a
house or a building or something.

639
00:51:58,995 --> 00:52:02,790
It’s in the middle of nowhere.
It’s not that far away.

640
00:52:02,832 --> 00:52:07,003
If I take the long road, I can
come around on it from behind.

641
00:52:07,045 --> 00:52:10,840
All right, look, William O’Connor.
Have you ever heard that name?

642
00:52:12,884 --> 00:52:14,343
No. I don’t know.

643
00:52:14,385 --> 00:52:15,887
All right, fuck it.

644
00:52:16,763 --> 00:52:19,265
Fuck it. All right,
I’ll come with you.

645
00:52:19,307 --> 00:52:21,642
No, no, no, no. No!
You have to let me go.

646
00:52:21,684 --> 00:52:23,352
No, I can’t just stay here.

647
00:52:23,394 --> 00:52:24,771
If something happens to me,

648
00:52:24,812 --> 00:52:27,065
he’s going to need
one of us. Okay?

649
00:52:27,106 --> 00:52:29,901
Just think before you do anything,
okay? Don’t do anything stupid.

650
00:52:29,942 --> 00:52:32,028
Uh-huh. All right?

651
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:34,906
And if you’re not back by midday,
then I’m calling the police.

652
00:52:34,947 --> 00:52:36,657
That’s it! Okay?
That’s it, Eddy!

653
00:52:37,992 --> 00:52:39,744
Call Inspector Roy.

654
00:52:41,746 --> 00:52:44,540
All right. I’ve
got Frank’s phone.

655
00:53:21,911 --> 00:53:27,750
Maybe, maybe, maybe, you might see a
shooting star or a comet or something.

656
00:53:27,792 --> 00:53:32,839
Wow! Your mum has done
amazing research into this camp.

657
00:53:34,507 --> 00:53:36,801
I think I just saw
a little smile.

658
00:53:41,472 --> 00:53:45,351
You will
reach your destination in 300 yards.

659
00:53:55,653 --> 00:53:59,490
You will reach your
destination in 200 yards.

660
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:23,973
You will reach your
destination in 100 yards.

661
00:54:30,855 --> 00:54:33,107
You have reached
your destination.

662
00:54:38,488 --> 00:54:39,947
Turn around.

663
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,701
Turn around.

664
00:59:36,994 --> 00:59:42,959
It’s too dangerous now. I
need to wait. I’ll leave in 20, I think.

665
00:59:43,543 --> 00:59:44,794
Okay.

666
01:00:43,102 --> 01:00:45,313
Look at me. Look up.

667
01:00:46,064 --> 01:00:48,149
What the... Look
at me. Look at me.

668
01:00:48,191 --> 01:00:51,027
Do you know who I am? No.

669
01:00:51,069 --> 01:00:53,279
Do you know why I’m here? No.

670
01:00:53,738 --> 01:00:55,406
I know who you are.

671
01:00:55,448 --> 01:00:58,326
What are you talking about?
I’ve got pictures of you.

672
01:00:58,367 --> 01:01:00,286
I got pictures of
your car. My car?

673
01:01:00,328 --> 01:01:02,038
Outside the Lockey Camp. What?

674
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,720
Outside the climbing
center in Crianlarich

675
01:01:03,748 --> 01:01:05,374
for two weeks following my son.

676
01:01:05,416 --> 01:01:06,584
Do you know who I am?

677
01:01:06,626 --> 01:01:07,710
You’re fucking mental, man.

678
01:01:07,752 --> 01:01:09,087
Do you know why I’m here?

679
01:01:09,128 --> 01:01:10,397
You’re making a
mistake here, man!

680
01:01:10,421 --> 01:01:11,672
This is fucking nothing...

681
01:01:11,714 --> 01:01:13,716
Tell me what I want to know!

682
01:01:13,758 --> 01:01:15,927
I don’t know what you’re
fucking talking about, man.

683
01:01:15,968 --> 01:01:17,929
Tell me what I want
to know! What about?

684
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:19,972
Where’s my fucking son?

685
01:01:20,014 --> 01:01:21,349
You’ve made a mistake, man!

686
01:01:21,391 --> 01:01:22,892
Just fucking untie
me and let me...

687
01:01:22,934 --> 01:01:24,602
Tell me where my fucking son is!

688
01:01:24,644 --> 01:01:28,564
Or I will drive this up through
your mouth, up through your brain,

689
01:01:28,606 --> 01:01:31,275
and outta the top of your
fucking head. Do you understand?

690
01:01:31,317 --> 01:01:33,820
I don’t fucking
know! You fuck!

691
01:01:34,612 --> 01:01:36,364
What are you fucking doing, man?

692
01:01:36,406 --> 01:01:38,908
Don’t fucking do that,
man! You’ve made a mistake.

693
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:43,204
Untie me, let me go, and I’ll say
fuck all about this, mate, all right?

694
01:01:45,206 --> 01:01:47,125
Man, what are you fucking doing?

695
01:01:48,459 --> 01:01:52,255
Man, don’t fucking do that,
man! I don’t fucking know!

696
01:01:52,296 --> 01:01:54,590
Tell me where my wee boy
is. I don’t fucking know!

697
01:01:54,632 --> 01:01:57,427
Fucking tell me where my wee
boy is. I don’t fucking know.

698
01:02:00,179 --> 01:02:01,931
You going to tell me
where my wee boy is?

699
01:02:01,973 --> 01:02:04,183
I don’t fucking know...

700
01:02:07,979 --> 01:02:10,189
What the fuck! Where’s
my fucking son?

701
01:02:10,231 --> 01:02:13,609
I don’t fucking know, man!
I don’t fucking... No, man!

702
01:02:13,651 --> 01:02:16,446
You take my fucking son?
Don’t fucking do that!

703
01:02:16,487 --> 01:02:19,115
I’m going to burn your fucking
feet off. No, don’t do that!

704
01:02:19,157 --> 01:02:20,592
Tell me right now! I
don’t fucking know.

705
01:02:20,616 --> 01:02:22,660
Where the fuck is my
son? I don’t know.

706
01:02:22,702 --> 01:02:24,454
Where’s my fucking son?

707
01:02:27,498 --> 01:02:30,918
You going to tell
me? Okay, okay, okay!

708
01:02:36,174 --> 01:02:37,592
Tell me where he is.

709
01:02:37,633 --> 01:02:39,510
He... He...

710
01:02:41,846 --> 01:02:44,140
What? Fucking speak!

711
01:02:44,182 --> 01:02:45,975
Dunmore Lodge. Where?

712
01:02:46,017 --> 01:02:47,810
Dunmore Lodge. We
take ’em there.

713
01:02:47,852 --> 01:02:50,146
We drop them there and they
come and pick them up later.

714
01:02:50,188 --> 01:02:51,856
Who? I don’t fucking know.

715
01:02:51,898 --> 01:02:55,318
Who? I fucking swear! I swear!

716
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:58,446
I don’t fucking know
that, man! I swear...

717
01:02:58,488 --> 01:03:00,323
I don’t fucking touch them, man.

718
01:03:00,364 --> 01:03:02,950
I’m not like them! I’m
not fucking like them.

719
01:03:02,992 --> 01:03:07,872
I’m not like that. I just deliver them.
I drop them off and that’s fucking it.

720
01:03:09,207 --> 01:03:13,044
You don’t touch them?
Never, man. Never.

721
01:03:17,965 --> 01:03:19,425
Who touches them?

722
01:03:21,552 --> 01:03:22,970
Who touches them?

723
01:03:23,012 --> 01:03:25,598
I don’t know, man. I
just... I take photos.

724
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:26,849
Fucking...

725
01:03:26,891 --> 01:03:29,102
I take photos
outside the schools.

726
01:03:29,143 --> 01:03:31,604
And then... And
then they pick them.

727
01:03:33,147 --> 01:03:34,899
I’m sorry, man.

728
01:03:37,443 --> 01:03:41,531
Don’t fucking hell, man! No!

729
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:22,807
He should be here.

730
01:10:24,225 --> 01:10:25,810
Huh?

731
01:10:25,852 --> 01:10:28,312
He should’ve been
here at least 15 minutes ago!

732
01:10:28,354 --> 01:10:30,022
Call him again, then.

733
01:10:42,243 --> 01:10:45,663
William, where the
fuck are you? You’re late!

734
01:10:47,165 --> 01:10:48,833
Come on. Spit it out.

735
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:50,835
Get in. Get in.

736
01:10:53,671 --> 01:10:55,381
He’s still not picking up.

737
01:10:55,423 --> 01:10:57,967
-  Shit!
-  I don’t like this.

738
01:10:58,009 --> 01:11:00,636
There’s cops everywhere.
They put roadblocks everywhere.

739
01:11:00,678 --> 01:11:04,682
The whole area’s swarming with
cops. Maybe he got nicked.

740
01:11:05,933 --> 01:11:09,020
Forget the girl. Let’s take
what we have and get outta here.

741
01:11:10,021 --> 01:11:12,023
They really
wanted the girl, though.

742
01:11:14,734 --> 01:11:15,818
Okay.

743
01:11:17,153 --> 01:11:19,906
We’re not staying
here. Let’s go.

744
01:11:21,032 --> 01:11:24,035
- Let’s go!
-  Hurry up!

745
01:11:36,172 --> 01:11:37,382
Fuck.

746
01:11:50,478 --> 01:11:51,938
Fuck it!

747
01:11:53,022 --> 01:11:58,361
Steven! It’s fucking
flat. When did that happen?

748
01:11:58,403 --> 01:12:00,798
It must have been done
on the road, when we drove here.

749
01:12:00,822 --> 01:12:04,867
Probably a nail or a screw.
Those can make it deflate slowly.

750
01:12:04,909 --> 01:12:07,036
It takes me five minutes
to put the spare on.

751
01:12:07,078 --> 01:12:10,748
Take the kid back inside. I’ll
call you when I’m finished.

752
01:14:18,918 --> 01:14:20,044
Steven?

753
01:14:23,381 --> 01:14:24,757
Steven!

754
01:14:28,594 --> 01:14:30,054
Where the fuck is he?

755
01:14:43,651 --> 01:14:45,069
Steven!

756
01:14:56,414 --> 01:14:59,250
Where are the fucking keys?
Give me your fucking keys.

757
01:15:01,127 --> 01:15:02,670
Here we go!

758
01:15:16,392 --> 01:15:17,769
Steven!

759
01:15:19,645 --> 01:15:20,688
Steven!

760
01:15:25,318 --> 01:15:29,238
Inspector Roy, it’s Joan Richmond. Can
you call me as soon as you get this?

761
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:36,954
Steven! Are you there?

762
01:15:45,129 --> 01:15:46,631
Are you there?

763
01:15:49,217 --> 01:15:50,676
Steven!

764
01:15:51,719 --> 01:15:53,930
What the fuck are
you playing at?

765
01:15:55,098 --> 01:15:57,058
- Steven!

766
01:16:00,103 --> 01:16:01,604
- Where the fuck is he?

767
01:16:26,838 --> 01:16:29,465
Have you seen Steven?
He’s not downstairs?

768
01:16:29,507 --> 01:16:30,967
Have you got the car keys?

769
01:16:31,008 --> 01:16:33,636
No, Steven has them.
Where the fuck is he?

770
01:16:33,678 --> 01:16:34,971
Call him!

771
01:16:48,234 --> 01:16:50,319
Shh, shh, shh...

772
01:16:55,283 --> 01:16:57,618
Steven, where
the hell are you?

773
01:16:57,660 --> 01:16:59,328
We’re looking all over for you.

774
01:17:06,377 --> 01:17:11,841
Listen to me. That wee
boy that you’ve got is my son.

775
01:17:11,883 --> 01:17:13,676
The police are on their way.

776
01:17:13,718 --> 01:17:16,888
You have to leave the little boy
where he is and just run away.

777
01:17:16,929 --> 01:17:18,389
It’s your only shot, pal.

778
01:17:20,725 --> 01:17:23,061
You listen to me, prick.

779
01:17:24,771 --> 01:17:26,981
I’m coming for you.

780
01:17:30,902 --> 01:17:32,695
Stay with the boy.

781
01:17:32,737 --> 01:17:36,532
What if the cops come?
Bullshit! Do what I told you.

782
01:17:36,574 --> 01:17:37,950
Fuck!

783
01:21:49,994 --> 01:21:53,247
Hey, man! Hey, man!

784
01:21:53,873 --> 01:21:54,957
Hey, Ethan!

785
01:21:54,999 --> 01:21:56,876
Ethan, can you wake up, pal?

786
01:21:56,918 --> 01:21:59,587
Can you wake... Can you wake up?

787
01:22:05,426 --> 01:22:08,346
You stay asleep.

788
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:50,930
Eddy! Joan!

789
01:22:50,972 --> 01:22:52,598
Eddy!

790
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:55,268
Shh, shh! Come this
way. Come on, quickly.

791
01:23:23,004 --> 01:23:24,422
You okay? Yeah.

792
01:23:38,603 --> 01:23:39,854
Fuck!

793
01:23:43,691 --> 01:23:46,027
Fuck!

794
01:23:53,284 --> 01:23:55,286
Is he still following us?

795
01:23:56,037 --> 01:23:57,455
I can’t see.

796
01:24:06,047 --> 01:24:07,340
Joan...

797
01:24:09,967 --> 01:24:11,010
Joan!

798
01:24:11,052 --> 01:24:12,512
Eddy?

799
01:24:13,471 --> 01:24:16,641
Eddy!  Eddy!

800
01:24:42,125 --> 01:24:43,501
Eddy?

801
01:24:48,631 --> 01:24:49,674
Eddy?

802
01:24:51,843 --> 01:24:52,927
Eddy!

803
01:24:53,845 --> 01:24:55,263
Eddy!

804
01:25:19,287 --> 01:25:24,000
It’s all right! It’s all right!
It’s me. You’re safe, you’re safe.

805
01:25:24,041 --> 01:25:26,294
Oh, geez! The boy...

806
01:25:26,335 --> 01:25:29,172
The boy is all right.
It’s all right.

807
01:26:02,663 --> 01:26:04,832
There you go. Just be real
gentle and take it over

808
01:26:04,874 --> 01:26:06,894
to the left, like that. Oh,
you see it bob like that?

809
01:26:06,918 --> 01:26:08,979
-  You want a go?
-  Yeah, you want a go?

810
01:26:09,003 --> 01:26:12,215
- Yeah, sure.
- You want to try it? Okay.

811
01:26:12,256 --> 01:26:14,175
Here we go.

812
01:26:14,217 --> 01:26:17,136
Right. Here we go, the vital
moment, the transference of power.

813
01:26:17,178 --> 01:26:18,930
Get your fingers on it. Ready?

814
01:26:18,971 --> 01:26:21,474
Get your fingers on it!
There, you’ve got it, wee man.

815
01:26:21,516 --> 01:26:23,059
It’s all yours.

816
01:26:23,101 --> 01:26:24,977
Well done, Ethan.

817
01:26:25,019 --> 01:26:26,437
Well done, pal.

818
01:26:27,438 --> 01:26:29,982
Is it good?

819
01:26:30,024 --> 01:26:33,528
Don’t bring it too close towards
you. I want to keep my hair.

820
01:26:34,195 --> 01:26:35,738
You cheeky thing...

821
01:26:37,698 --> 01:26:39,075
Whoa!

822
01:26:43,287 --> 01:26:45,415
So good, wee man. So good.

823
01:26:45,456 --> 01:26:48,543
I’m going to leave this to you, ’cause
you seem to know what you’re doing.

824
01:26:48,584 --> 01:26:50,586
You do! Kinda.

825
01:26:50,628 --> 01:26:52,630
It’s making me scared.

826
01:26:53,506 --> 01:26:55,591
Don’t drop it on our heads!

827
01:26:57,301 --> 01:26:59,679
Whoa!

828
01:27:01,347 --> 01:27:02,807
Wow! Wow!

829
01:27:02,849 --> 01:27:05,184
You’ll be a pilot for the
MOD before you know it.

830
01:27:05,226 --> 01:27:06,811
Mr. Murray!

831
01:27:11,649 --> 01:27:12,900
Hey, pal...

832
01:27:14,652 --> 01:27:16,612
I’m going to need to get going.

833
01:27:16,654 --> 01:27:19,949
Should we land it and
say a proper bye-bye?

834
01:27:21,993 --> 01:27:23,745
Okay, all right.

835
01:27:31,335 --> 01:27:32,545
I love you, pal.

836
01:27:32,587 --> 01:27:34,714
When are you coming back?

837
01:27:36,299 --> 01:27:37,633
Um...

838
01:27:40,178 --> 01:27:42,805
I might be a wee while. Okay.

839
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:46,017
But I am going to come back.

840
01:27:47,685 --> 01:27:49,520
I’ll come back
and be here, okay?

841
01:27:49,562 --> 01:27:50,897
Okay.

842
01:27:59,739 --> 01:28:00,907
Okay.

843
01:28:03,409 --> 01:28:05,495
See ya, Joan. See ya.

844
01:28:31,562 --> 01:28:33,481
You okay? Yeah.

845
01:28:35,942 --> 01:28:37,860
Whoa!

846
01:29:07,306 --> 01:29:11,144
The dismantling of the network
is accelerating, you know.

847
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:15,815
I believe that there
will be more arrests.

848
01:29:16,691 --> 01:29:19,652
It’ll be a big
list. What a shame.

849
01:29:21,821 --> 01:29:24,073
But it could be good
for you. You think?

850
01:29:24,115 --> 01:29:29,036
Yes. The judge will probably
take this into account.

851
01:29:30,079 --> 01:29:31,998
Aye, hopefully.

851
01:29:32,305 --> 01:30:32,371
