<i>Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.</i>

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.org ] ==-

4
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,367
I got another 15.

5
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,575
Not today, you don't.
You're up.

6
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,825
You know the deal.

7
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:48,158
Successfully complete
the mission,

8
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:49,950
you get ten years
off your sentence.

9
00:01:52,742 --> 00:01:54,742
<i>You fail to follow my orders
in any way</i>

10
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:58,950
<i>and I detonate the explosive
device in the base of your skull.</i>

11
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:00,242
Good dog.

12
00:02:00,325 --> 00:02:01,825
<i>We are
a black ops unit.</i>

13
00:02:01,908 --> 00:02:04,408
<i>Meaning, nothing you see here
ever happened.</i>

14
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:06,158
Savant.

15
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:08,075
<i>Your commanding officer
will be Colonel Rick Flag.</i>

16
00:02:08,158 --> 00:02:10,033
Or would you
rather be called Durlin?

17
00:02:10,117 --> 00:02:11,825
I'd rather not
be called at all.

18
00:02:11,908 --> 00:02:15,033
But I'll do anything
to get out of this hellhole.

19
00:02:17,992 --> 00:02:20,283
Well,
welcome to "anything."

20
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:27,033
So this is
the famous Suicide Squad.

21
00:02:27,117 --> 00:02:29,617
Well, we consider
that term degrading.

22
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,075
The official term
is "Task Force X."

23
00:02:32,158 --> 00:02:33,700
And love 'em or hate 'em,

24
00:02:33,783 --> 00:02:35,908
these are your brothers and
sisters for the next few days.

25
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,158
Oh!

26
00:02:42,117 --> 00:02:43,075
Whoa.

27
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,700
Captain Boomerang.

28
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,325
Blackguard.

29
00:03:01,992 --> 00:03:03,200
Mongal.

30
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,492
Javelin.

31
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:08,408
T.D.K.

32
00:03:09,992 --> 00:03:10,992
Weasel.

33
00:03:13,242 --> 00:03:14,575
And, of course...

34
00:03:14,658 --> 00:03:17,242
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
Had to go number two.

35
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:18,658
Hmm, good to know.

36
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:20,700
Flag.

37
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,575
Oh, sorry. Comin' through.

38
00:03:22,658 --> 00:03:23,867
Hey, Boomer.

39
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,575
What are you doing back
in prison, Harls?

40
00:03:25,658 --> 00:03:27,658
I got road rage. In a bank.

41
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:29,783
Oh. So sorry. Comin' through.

42
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:32,367
- Turn it around. There. No.
- There? Here?

43
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,367
Put it in there.
Now you're safe.

44
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,825
All right.

45
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:37,242
Thanks, man.

46
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:40,575
Prepare for liftoff.
And away we go.

47
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:49,283
- Harley and T.D.K...
- Digger.

48
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:50,742
...have they worked
together before?

49
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:51,908
Not yet. I'm excited.

50
00:03:51,992 --> 00:03:52,950
What does
Savant do again?

51
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,450
It's Brian Durlin.

52
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:56,783
He's an expert in weapons
and hand-to-hand combat.

53
00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:59,283
Yeah, well, I'm putting 20
on him that he's gonna bite it.

54
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:00,617
Me too. And Weasel,

55
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,283
- Boomer and Mongal.
- Yeah, I think...

56
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,617
Is Mongal an alien
or some type of god?

57
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,992
- What are you doing?
- Oh. Hey.

58
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:07,367
Just making sure
everything was ready to go.

59
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,700
Good meeting, everybody.

60
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:10,408
Just our normal,
casual morning meeting.

61
00:04:10,492 --> 00:04:11,825
Yeah, I just gotta, uh,
do this thing.

62
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:13,158
Nothing weird about it.

63
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:14,325
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

64
00:04:17,783 --> 00:04:19,117
Flag.

65
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,367
<i>Yeah, we're T-minus five
from the drop.</i>

66
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,450
Get the whole team safely

67
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:22,992
<i>to that beach, Colonel.</i>

68
00:04:23,075 --> 00:04:25,408
<i>You will receive
further orders once there.</i>

69
00:04:40,325 --> 00:04:42,617
We're in
a butcher's freezer, Harls,

70
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,242
surrounded by dead hogs
hangin' on hooks.

71
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:47,825
Only they don't know it yet.

72
00:04:47,908 --> 00:04:50,492
Leave him alone, Boomer.

73
00:04:50,575 --> 00:04:52,658
What does T.D.K. stand for?

74
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:53,658
What?

75
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:56,283
Your name is T.D.K., correct?

76
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:57,658
Yeah.

77
00:04:57,742 --> 00:04:59,492
And it stands for what?

78
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:01,742
It stands for me.

79
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:03,200
It's what a name is.

80
00:05:03,283 --> 00:05:05,158
Your name is letters?

81
00:05:05,242 --> 00:05:07,367
All names are letters,
dickhead.

82
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,617
I love your accent.

83
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,617
American women
all love accents.

84
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,533
We do.
'Cause we don't got none.

85
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:23,242
- Yo, is this a dog?
- What?

86
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:25,700
Is this thing a dog?

87
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,617
- A... A dog?
- Yes.

88
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,742
What kind of dog
do you think it is, mate?

89
00:05:29,825 --> 00:05:31,867
I don't know, I'm not familiar
with all the breeds.

90
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,617
I'm gonna go with Afghan Hound.

91
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,950
Since when does an Afghan
Hound have bloody thumbs?

92
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:37,908
Oh, my God, is it a werewolf?

93
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:39,783
I've wanted to meet
a werewolf forever.

94
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:41,408
Yo, they sat me
next to a werewolf?

95
00:05:41,492 --> 00:05:42,867
That's not right.

96
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,408
Yo, let me out.
I do not fuck with werewolves.

97
00:05:44,492 --> 00:05:46,492
Hey, hey,
he's not a werewolf, okay!

98
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:47,992
He's a weasel. He's harmless.

99
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:50,408
I mean, he's not harmless,
he's killed 27 children,

100
00:05:50,492 --> 00:05:52,033
but, you know, we got him to...

101
00:05:52,117 --> 00:05:53,658
I think he's agreed to do this.

102
00:05:53,742 --> 00:05:54,950
Whatever the case,

103
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:56,950
just everyone
get into position to drop.

104
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:59,242
Did anyone check
on whether Weasel could swim?

105
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:41,200
The Weasel is dead! I repeat,

106
00:07:41,283 --> 00:07:43,450
<i>the Weasel is dead.</i>

107
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:46,200
Northeast, all clear.
Approach the shore.

108
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:47,158
<i>Over.</i>

109
00:07:47,242 --> 00:07:49,033
Savant, hold your position.

110
00:07:49,742 --> 00:07:50,908
Roger that.

111
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,283
Amateurs.

112
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,450
Waller, we're
on the beach and dry.

113
00:08:35,575 --> 00:08:37,242
- Blackguard. Get down, you...
- Hey, guys! Hey.

114
00:08:37,325 --> 00:08:38,658
...there's fucking soldiers
everywhere!

115
00:08:38,742 --> 00:08:40,200
You can come out now,
it's just me.

116
00:08:40,283 --> 00:08:42,242
What the fuck
is Blackguard doin'?

117
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:43,742
I'm the one who contacted you.

118
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:45,533
Is this what's supposed
to happen? What the fuck?

119
00:08:45,617 --> 00:08:47,575
Blackguard, get back
into your position.

120
00:08:47,658 --> 00:08:49,325
Look, look.
I brought everybody, look.

121
00:08:49,408 --> 00:08:50,867
They're right behind me.

122
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,200
Whoa. Hey.

123
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,992
Hey, guys. Whoa.

124
00:08:55,075 --> 00:08:57,783
We got a deal, right?
Uh... Uh...

125
00:08:57,867 --> 00:08:59,408
Waller, we're made.

126
00:08:59,492 --> 00:09:01,742
I'm the one who called you.

127
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,950
Blackguard sold us out.

128
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:12,700
<i>He contacted the fucking
Corto Maltese Army!</i>

129
00:09:12,783 --> 00:09:14,325
<i>Waller, we need to retreat.</i>

130
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:16,283
Negative, Flag.

131
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:17,658
The mission is too important.

132
00:09:17,742 --> 00:09:18,992
<i>This is a tough group.</i>

133
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:20,617
- <i>You can make it.</i>
- Okey-doke.

134
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,950
Waller, with all due respect,
we're in the middle

135
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,283
of a goddamn... Harley, wait!

136
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:24,658
Whoo-hoo!

137
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,242
Zero-two-two-seven
is wide open.

138
00:10:07,325 --> 00:10:08,658
Colonel, dispatch

139
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:11,200
- <i>The Detachable Kid.</i>
- T.D.K., two o'clock!

140
00:10:13,075 --> 00:10:16,200
T.D.K. is "The Detachable Kid"?

141
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:37,700
What the fuck?

142
00:10:37,783 --> 00:10:39,742
I didn't pick the damn team!

143
00:10:39,825 --> 00:10:43,158
Don't worry, Flag,
I got the bird.

144
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,908
Mongal! Don't.

145
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:49,825
Huh?

146
00:11:01,492 --> 00:11:02,325
Strewth!

147
00:11:06,617 --> 00:11:07,450
Boomer!

148
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:39,575
Savant is off the rails.

149
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,617
Savant, turn back.

150
00:11:44,992 --> 00:11:46,867
<i>Savant.</i>

151
00:11:49,283 --> 00:11:52,783
Savant, I'm warning you,
this is desertion.

152
00:11:54,492 --> 00:11:55,617
Savant!

153
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,408
This is your last chance.
Turn back around.

154
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:00,658
<i>You are in violation
of your agreement!</i>

155
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:04,950
<i>Oh, please! No.</i>

156
00:12:09,283 --> 00:12:10,367
Damn it.

157
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,408
How's Team Two holding up?

158
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:32,408
Team Two, check.
Set point bravo.

159
00:12:34,075 --> 00:12:36,283
All troops on the south beach
are engaged.

160
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:38,617
Team Two is clear to go
on the north beach.

161
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,492
Congratulations, Bloodsport.

162
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:58,158
How'd you do it, Waller?

163
00:12:58,242 --> 00:13:00,700
<i>There's no soldiers out here
on patrol at all.</i>

164
00:13:00,783 --> 00:13:03,575
<i>Let's
just say they were distracted.</i>

165
00:15:16,992 --> 00:15:18,658
Oh, jeez.

166
00:15:18,742 --> 00:15:19,617
Oh.

167
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,075
Here you go, champ.

168
00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:29,200
Excuse me.

169
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:33,283
Who the fuck is Bloodsport?

170
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:36,492
Robert DuBois.

171
00:15:36,575 --> 00:15:38,658
A world-class marksman.

172
00:15:38,742 --> 00:15:41,617
In his hands,
anything is a deadly weapon.

173
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,242
His father was a mercenary

174
00:15:43,325 --> 00:15:46,242
who trained his son to kill
from the moment he was born.

175
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:49,033
He's in prison for putting
Superman in the ICU

176
00:15:49,117 --> 00:15:51,242
with a kryptonite bullet.

177
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,492
- DuBois?
- Same answer as the last time.

178
00:15:54,575 --> 00:15:55,575
Piss off.

179
00:15:57,783 --> 00:16:00,658
I'm not joining your goddamn
Suicide Squad.

180
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:02,367
We'll see.

181
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:04,908
You have a visitor.

182
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:21,408
They said you got in trouble.

183
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,783
<i>I stole.</i>

184
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:24,992
You stole what?

185
00:16:26,742 --> 00:16:29,325
- <i>A style watch.</i>
- A star latch?

186
00:16:29,408 --> 00:16:32,867
A style watch.
You can watch TV on it.

187
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,033
<i>Why would you want to
watch TV on your watch?</i>

188
00:16:35,117 --> 00:16:36,492
I don't know.

189
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:38,200
<i>Next time you want
to nick something,</i>

190
00:16:38,283 --> 00:16:39,325
<i>you take a partner,</i>

191
00:16:39,408 --> 00:16:40,617
<i>and they can be your lookout.</i>

192
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,742
<i>That's your advice?</i>

193
00:16:42,825 --> 00:16:43,742
<i>Yeah.</i>

194
00:16:43,825 --> 00:16:45,575
<i>You're a terrible father.</i>

195
00:16:45,658 --> 00:16:47,158
<i>Hey, I didn't ask to be a
father in the first place.</i>

196
00:16:47,242 --> 00:16:48,450
<i>You make that perfectly clear.</i>

197
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:50,575
Your mother sprung
that one on me.

198
00:16:50,658 --> 00:16:51,908
<i>Well, she's not around anymore,</i>

199
00:16:51,992 --> 00:16:53,117
<i>so you can lay off
of her, okay?</i>

200
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,533
<i>Oh, I tried to lay off her,</i>

201
00:16:54,617 --> 00:16:56,117
but then she dragged out
the paternity test.

202
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,742
- <i>Fuck you!</i>
- <i>No, fuck you!</i>

203
00:16:57,825 --> 00:16:59,200
- <i>Fuck you!</i>
- <i>Fuck you!</i>

204
00:16:59,283 --> 00:17:00,617
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

205
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,283
- <i>Fuck you!</i>
- Fuck you!

206
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:03,658
<i>Fuck you!</i>

207
00:17:03,742 --> 00:17:05,992
I can't believe
you don't care that I stole,

208
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:07,575
only that I got caught!

209
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:08,992
I don't only care
that you got caught,

210
00:17:09,075 --> 00:17:10,450
I care that you got caught
for stealing

211
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:13,450
something as stupid
as a fucking TV watch!

212
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,200
It does other things too!

213
00:17:15,283 --> 00:17:16,992
<i>But nothing that your phone
can't fucking do!</i>

214
00:17:17,075 --> 00:17:18,033
<i>It's embarrassing!</i>

215
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:19,575
<i>No, what's fucking embarrassing</i>

216
00:17:19,658 --> 00:17:22,033
<i>is having you as my father.</i>

217
00:17:29,242 --> 00:17:32,033
<i>Yeah, well, I told you, Tyla,</i>

218
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,700
<i>when I came here
that any goodness</i>

219
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:37,450
I ever had in me had been
wrung out bare by my old man.

220
00:17:37,533 --> 00:17:39,908
And I also told you to go out
there and do your own thing

221
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,283
and stay far away

222
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:44,658
<i>from me or anyone like me,
didn't I?</i>

223
00:17:44,742 --> 00:17:46,783
So, why are you here
when you and I both know

224
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:49,033
I have nothing good
to offer you?

225
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:54,242
<i>Because my court date
is coming up,</i>

226
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:57,617
<i>and Miss Waller said
maybe you could help me out.</i>

227
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,992
To get me to lead
your shite fucking mission,

228
00:18:00,075 --> 00:18:02,242
you're gonna send my
14-year-old daughter to prison?

229
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:03,325
No.

230
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:06,992
Your daughter is 16, DuBois.

231
00:18:07,075 --> 00:18:08,575
You're a real
father of the year.

232
00:18:08,658 --> 00:18:10,158
Fine. You know what,
Tyla needs to grow up anyway

233
00:18:10,242 --> 00:18:11,700
'cause she's a little ditzy
like her fucking mother.

234
00:18:11,783 --> 00:18:14,158
So, a year in juvie,
no fucking problem.

235
00:18:14,242 --> 00:18:17,283
Not juvie. Being 16
in the state of Louisiana

236
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:19,992
means that
under the right circumstances,

237
00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:21,658
she could be tried as an adult.

238
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:22,992
And, if convicted,

239
00:18:23,075 --> 00:18:27,033
could be sent right here
to old Belle Reve.

240
00:18:27,117 --> 00:18:29,408
And in here, well, you never
know what might happen

241
00:18:29,492 --> 00:18:31,617
to a frail young thing
like that.

242
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,033
Shames me to say

243
00:18:34,117 --> 00:18:36,033
that we have
the highest mortality rate

244
00:18:36,117 --> 00:18:38,575
in the entire
U.S. prison system.

245
00:18:41,575 --> 00:18:42,825
Whoa, hey, hey, hey!

246
00:18:42,908 --> 00:18:44,367
You're threatening
my fucking daughter!

247
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,158
I'm protecting this country.

248
00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:48,283
- Everyone stand down.
- Miss Waller, I...

249
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:50,200
Stand down!

250
00:18:54,992 --> 00:18:56,867
I wouldn't take
such extreme measures...

251
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,742
Oh, extreme?
Oh, yeah, a little extreme.

252
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:00,700
...if this mission
weren't more important

253
00:19:00,783 --> 00:19:02,325
than you could
possibly imagine.

254
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:03,700
Fuck your mission.

255
00:19:03,783 --> 00:19:05,367
You have the military
experience necessary,

256
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,992
and everything in your
psychological profile tells me

257
00:19:08,075 --> 00:19:09,575
you have what it takes
to be a leader.

258
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:11,408
No, I'm no fucking leader!

259
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:13,408
Then I'll make you one.

260
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:19,908
Are you in or out?

261
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,825
Good. Let's meet your team.

262
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,283
- Come on.
- Fuck me, man.

263
00:19:32,158 --> 00:19:33,075
Let's go.

264
00:19:33,158 --> 00:19:34,492
She was gonna kill his kid?

265
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:39,783
Each member
of the team is chosen

266
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:43,492
for his or her own completely
unique set of abilities.

267
00:19:43,575 --> 00:19:47,575
This is Christopher Smith,
known as Peacemaker.

268
00:19:47,658 --> 00:19:50,242
In his hands,
anything is a deadly weapon.

269
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:52,367
His father was a soldier
who trained his son

270
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,408
how to kill from the moment
he was born.

271
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:56,325
- Are you having a laugh?
- What?

272
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:58,117
You just said each member
of the team is chosen

273
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,908
for their unique abilities.
He does exactly what I do.

274
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:02,158
But better.

275
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,408
I always hit
my targets dead center.

276
00:20:03,492 --> 00:20:04,825
I hit them more in the center.

277
00:20:04,908 --> 00:20:06,117
Well, you can't hit something
more in a center.

278
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,533
- I use smaller bullets.
- What?

279
00:20:07,617 --> 00:20:08,825
They go inside
your bullet holes

280
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,075
without even touching the side.

281
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:12,700
Next up is King Shark.

282
00:20:12,783 --> 00:20:13,742
Holy shit.

283
00:20:13,825 --> 00:20:16,033
What the fuck?

284
00:20:16,117 --> 00:20:17,533
Some people claim

285
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:20,367
that Nanaue is a descendant
of an ancient shark god.

286
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,783
Whatever the case,
he's strong and deadly.

287
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:24,283
Does it talk?

288
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:26,450
- Book read.
- Wow.

289
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:27,867
Book's upside-down.

290
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,242
See that? It's pretending
to read a book.

291
00:20:29,325 --> 00:20:33,908
So smart, me.
Enjoy book so much.

292
00:20:33,992 --> 00:20:35,200
Be a mite careful,

293
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:37,117
as he's developed a taste
for human meat.

294
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,992
Huh?

295
00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:40,450
Next, we have Cleo Cazo,

296
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:42,867
Ratcatcher 2.

297
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,617
Settle down!

298
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,783
Ooh.

299
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:47,450
What, we couldn't
afford Ratcatcher 1?

300
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:48,992
He's dead.
This is his daughter.

301
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:51,617
Cazo, will you be joining us?

302
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,617
I just woke up.

303
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,950
I don't function well
early in the morning.

304
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:58,658
My deepest apologies
for disturbing you.

305
00:20:58,742 --> 00:20:59,783
Hmm, it's all right.

306
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:01,825
Get your ass out here!

307
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,367
Millennials.

308
00:21:13,908 --> 00:21:15,908
Oh, no way.

309
00:21:15,992 --> 00:21:18,367
- That's not coming with us.
- She controls rats.

310
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,533
I know, I caught that.
It's a disgusting superpower.

311
00:21:20,617 --> 00:21:23,742
This is Sebastian.
Say hello, Sebastian.

312
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:28,117
I'm not shakin' the rat's hand.

313
00:21:29,408 --> 00:21:32,117
And finally,
we have Abner Krill.

314
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:34,367
What's that 'round his neck?

315
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,575
A power dampener.

316
00:21:35,658 --> 00:21:37,408
They call him
the Polka Dot Man.

317
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:39,450
Polka Dot Man.

318
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:41,658
What's he do,
throw polka dots at people?

319
00:21:44,283 --> 00:21:45,825
He does.

320
00:21:45,908 --> 00:21:47,575
He throws polka dots at people.

321
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:49,033
Hey, Polka Dot Man,

322
00:21:49,117 --> 00:21:51,367
I was hoping you'd entertain
my kid's birthday party.

323
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:55,200
You fucking pussy!

324
00:21:55,283 --> 00:21:57,242
These are soldiers?

325
00:21:57,325 --> 00:21:58,950
We need to debrief.

326
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,075
Fuck.

327
00:22:09,158 --> 00:22:11,242
Corto Maltese

328
00:22:11,325 --> 00:22:14,867
is a small island nation off
the coast of South America.

329
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,450
Over the past 100 years,

330
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:19,325
the country has been ruled
with an iron fist

331
00:22:19,408 --> 00:22:21,575
by the Herrera family.

332
00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:25,242
But, a week ago, this guy,

333
00:22:25,325 --> 00:22:28,908
General Silvio Luna,
along with his right-hand man,

334
00:22:28,992 --> 00:22:31,742
Mayor General Mateo Suarez,

335
00:22:31,825 --> 00:22:34,408
took control of
the Corto Maltese government

336
00:22:34,492 --> 00:22:36,742
in a violent military coup.

337
00:22:36,825 --> 00:22:41,783
The entire Herrera family were
hanged in a public execution.

338
00:22:41,867 --> 00:22:43,950
Although the United States
did not condone

339
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:46,408
the excesses
of the Herrera regime,

340
00:22:46,492 --> 00:22:49,450
they were non-antagonistic
toward the U.S.

341
00:22:49,533 --> 00:22:53,742
Luna, however,
is virulently anti-American.

342
00:22:53,825 --> 00:22:55,325
So, you want us to kill Luna?

343
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:56,533
No.

344
00:22:57,325 --> 00:22:59,117
This is Jotunheim.

345
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,450
A scientific
experimentation facility

346
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:06,033
containing something known only
as Project Starfish.

347
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:07,992
Our intelligence sources
tell us

348
00:23:08,075 --> 00:23:11,450
that Starfish
is extraterrestrial in origin.

349
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:13,783
In the hands
of the Luna regime,

350
00:23:13,867 --> 00:23:18,283
it is potentially cataclysmic
for Americans and the world.

351
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:22,658
Your mission
is to infiltrate Jotunheim

352
00:23:22,742 --> 00:23:26,450
and destroy every trace
of Project Starfish.

353
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:27,825
How are we supposed to get in?

354
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,950
Gaius Grieves, the Thinker,

355
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,992
is a geneticist in charge
of Project Starfish.

356
00:23:33,075 --> 00:23:36,117
After hours, he hangs out
at a gentlemen's club

357
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,950
known as La Gatita Amable.

358
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:41,950
Get Grieves to help you
by whatever means necessary

359
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:44,325
and he can get you
into Jotunheim.

360
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:46,575
Any questions?

361
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,575
What is that?

362
00:23:50,658 --> 00:23:52,950
That is
an overhead projector.

363
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:54,533
Do you ever use it anymore?

364
00:23:54,617 --> 00:23:55,908
No, not really.

365
00:23:55,992 --> 00:23:57,992
So, why don't you
just throw it away?

366
00:23:58,075 --> 00:23:59,783
Peacemaker?

367
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:02,658
Starfish is a slang term
for a butthole.

368
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:03,825
Think there's any connection?

369
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:07,408
No.

370
00:24:08,908 --> 00:24:09,825
No...

371
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:10,783
Nanaue.

372
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:12,242
...connection.

373
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:13,533
Hand.

374
00:24:13,617 --> 00:24:16,992
Yes, that is your hand,
Nanaue, very good.

375
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:21,533
We're all gonna die.

376
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:23,450
I hope so.

377
00:24:24,783 --> 00:24:26,783
Oh, for fuck's sake.

378
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:52,617
Control, we have a disturbance
south of here.

379
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,492
<i>It's just
a diversion, Bloodsport.</i>

380
00:24:54,575 --> 00:24:57,658
All right, we cut through the
jungle to get to Valle Del Mar.

381
00:24:57,742 --> 00:24:59,783
Don't they have blockades
at the city limits?

382
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:01,367
That's the word.

383
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,742
How we getting in? Especially
with Charlie the Tuna here.

384
00:25:03,825 --> 00:25:05,242
How the hell am I
supposed to know?

385
00:25:05,325 --> 00:25:06,283
You're the leader.

386
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:07,783
You're supposed to be decisive.

387
00:25:07,867 --> 00:25:08,992
And I've decided
that you should eat

388
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:10,658
a big bag of dicks, how's that?

389
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,700
You're being facetious,
but if this whole beach

390
00:25:12,783 --> 00:25:13,908
was completely covered in dicks

391
00:25:13,992 --> 00:25:15,408
and somebody said I had to eat

392
00:25:15,492 --> 00:25:16,825
every dick until the beach
was clean for liberty,

393
00:25:16,908 --> 00:25:18,367
I would say no problemo.

394
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,117
Why would someone put penises
all over the beach?

395
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,450
Who knows why madmen
do what they do?

396
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:23,783
Well, you know what I think?

397
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:25,242
I think liberty
is just your excuse

398
00:25:25,325 --> 00:25:26,908
to do whatever you want.

399
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,825
Whether that's to eat a beach
full of dicks or killin' folk.

400
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:35,158
Oh, yeah?

401
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:38,158
At least I don't kill men
for money like you.

402
00:25:38,242 --> 00:25:39,742
Oh, here we go.

403
00:25:39,825 --> 00:25:41,575
There's something wrong
with your skin.

404
00:25:42,617 --> 00:25:43,742
It's just a rash.

405
00:25:43,825 --> 00:25:45,200
That's a rash?

406
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,783
Oh, no.

407
00:26:04,242 --> 00:26:05,450
You...

408
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:08,367
are the only one...

409
00:26:09,575 --> 00:26:13,367
fit to carry my javelin.

410
00:26:22,783 --> 00:26:24,408
Carry it for...

411
00:26:46,825 --> 00:26:48,367
Carry it for who?

412
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,950
For what? What the heck?

413
00:26:50,033 --> 00:26:51,742
Who am I supposed
to carry it for?

414
00:26:54,283 --> 00:26:55,742
This is so frustratin'.

415
00:26:55,825 --> 00:26:57,658
He just told me I have
to carry this javelin

416
00:26:57,742 --> 00:27:00,242
for a reason,
but he didn't say why!

417
00:27:01,992 --> 00:27:06,033
Waller? Waller. Waller!

418
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:17,242
All right, we'll camp here,

419
00:27:17,325 --> 00:27:19,242
and tomorrow we'll go
straight through to the city

420
00:27:19,325 --> 00:27:21,825
to get to La Gatita Amable
by nightfall.

421
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,450
What?

422
00:28:52,783 --> 00:28:54,533
How deep of a sleeper are you?

423
00:28:54,617 --> 00:28:57,617
I was having
the most wonderful dream.

424
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,783
If it was you about to be
eaten by King Shark,

425
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:01,158
then you're psychic.

426
00:29:01,242 --> 00:29:02,408
I don't believe
he would do that.

427
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:04,617
He has very kind eyes.

428
00:29:08,033 --> 00:29:10,533
Hungry.

429
00:29:10,617 --> 00:29:11,908
You bastard!

430
00:29:13,283 --> 00:29:15,408
Uh...

431
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:28,992
All right,
calm down with the rats!

432
00:29:29,075 --> 00:29:31,325
- What?
- I have a thing with rats.

433
00:29:31,408 --> 00:29:33,158
- You have a thing with rats?
- Yes.

434
00:29:33,242 --> 00:29:36,075
- And you're on a team with me?
- Not something I asked for!

435
00:29:37,283 --> 00:29:38,617
What are you
laughing at me for, man?

436
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,033
Why the fuck are you
in your underwear?

437
00:29:40,117 --> 00:29:41,408
Tighty-whities? Really?

438
00:29:41,492 --> 00:29:42,908
- Now, that's just racist.
- No.

439
00:29:42,992 --> 00:29:44,617
<i>It's not racist.</i>

440
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,450
- <i>They're tighty-whities.</i>
- Oh, come the fuck on.

441
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:49,200
Bloodsport's got a rat phobia.

442
00:29:49,283 --> 00:29:51,283
What?

443
00:29:51,367 --> 00:29:52,408
You didn't tell me

444
00:29:52,492 --> 00:29:54,492
<i>you had a fear of rats, DuBois?</i>

445
00:29:54,575 --> 00:29:57,408
I'm an assassin! Why would I
share my liabilities?

446
00:29:58,658 --> 00:29:59,908
For fuck's sake.

447
00:29:59,992 --> 00:30:01,700
Aw. He's offering you
a pretty leaf

448
00:30:01,783 --> 00:30:03,867
to show you he means no harm.

449
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,158
Why the fuck
would I want a leaf?

450
00:30:07,242 --> 00:30:08,575
Just get the rats out of here!

451
00:30:14,242 --> 00:30:17,367
- Oh, fuck's sake.
- Huh. Cool.

452
00:30:21,158 --> 00:30:22,867
Hey, we gonna kill
Megalodouche now, or what?

453
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,783
<i>Nanaue's the strongest
member of your team.</i>

454
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:26,992
You need him
to get into Jotunheim.

455
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,658
Yeah, well,
we can't function as a team

456
00:30:28,742 --> 00:30:30,033
if we gotta watch our back

457
00:30:30,117 --> 00:30:31,450
from one of our own
eatin' our bollocks.

458
00:30:33,158 --> 00:30:37,533
Nanaue,
would you eat your friends?

459
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:40,908
I no friends.

460
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:43,575
You have no friends?

461
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,867
If you did, would you eat them?

462
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,033
Yes.

463
00:30:56,533 --> 00:30:58,658
No?

464
00:30:58,742 --> 00:31:01,117
Then, can we be your friends?

465
00:31:01,825 --> 00:31:03,367
Come on.

466
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,575
He's obviously lying.

467
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,325
If I die
'cause I gambled on love,

468
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,700
it will be a worthy death.

469
00:31:15,492 --> 00:31:16,450
Friends.

470
00:31:24,575 --> 00:31:26,283
You are a little idiot.

471
00:31:35,408 --> 00:31:39,075
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
I'm good at my job.

472
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:40,242
I found him.

473
00:31:40,325 --> 00:31:41,283
Check it out.

474
00:31:42,283 --> 00:31:44,242
Look, right here, a mile north.

475
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:46,783
Task Force X,

476
00:31:46,867 --> 00:31:48,242
you have an additional
mission directive.

477
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:50,200
<i>We've located
Colonel Rick Flag.</i>

478
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,658
<i>He's been taken by the enemy.</i>

479
00:31:51,742 --> 00:31:52,658
Rick Flag?

480
00:31:52,742 --> 00:31:54,242
<i>I know, you both served</i>

481
00:31:54,325 --> 00:31:56,658
on special forces in Qurac
that took down Avral Kaddam.

482
00:31:56,742 --> 00:31:59,908
<i>Flag was the one
who initially recommended you.</i>

483
00:31:59,992 --> 00:32:01,992
You had other
operatives in Corto Maltese

484
00:32:02,075 --> 00:32:03,950
and didn't tell us?

485
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:07,408
<i>There was no tactical
advantage, now there is.</i>

486
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:10,200
<i>I've uploaded the location
on your MTS.</i>

487
00:32:10,283 --> 00:32:14,658
<i>Terminate his captors
with extreme prejudice.</i>

488
00:32:14,742 --> 00:32:19,033
<i>Kill anyone you see.
These are dangerous people.</i>

489
00:32:19,117 --> 00:32:21,867
<i>Recover Flag before moving on
to the city.</i>

490
00:32:27,075 --> 00:32:28,950
That's where
they're holding Flag.

491
00:32:29,033 --> 00:32:31,867
Nothing like a bloodbath
to start the day.

492
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,325
They call you Peacemaker?

493
00:32:33,408 --> 00:32:35,533
I cherish peace
with all my heart.

494
00:32:35,617 --> 00:32:36,867
I don't care
how many men, women,

495
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,450
and children
I need to kill to get it.

496
00:32:39,742 --> 00:32:41,783
I thought
you were the crazy one.

497
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,867
I am.

498
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,492
All right.

499
00:32:45,575 --> 00:32:46,783
Let's get it.

500
00:32:49,575 --> 00:32:50,617
Boss.

501
00:32:51,283 --> 00:32:52,200
<i>Gracias.</i>

502
00:33:05,575 --> 00:33:08,075
No, no, no!

503
00:34:39,658 --> 00:34:40,658
No, no, no!

504
00:35:05,408 --> 00:35:06,242
Hmm?

505
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,742
Non-lethal.

506
00:35:11,825 --> 00:35:13,200
You lose.

507
00:35:13,283 --> 00:35:15,075
Exploding compression bullets.

508
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,325
No one likes a show-off.

509
00:35:20,408 --> 00:35:22,950
Unless what they're
showing off is dope as fuck.

510
00:35:25,867 --> 00:35:27,908
Fuck. That's true.

511
00:35:43,283 --> 00:35:45,117
He does throw
polka dots at people.

512
00:35:46,283 --> 00:35:48,658
I'm sorry it's so...
flamboyant.

513
00:35:48,742 --> 00:35:51,367
It looks cool. I think.

514
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,700
I don't like to kill people,

515
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,992
but if I pretend
they're my mom, it's easy.

516
00:35:55,075 --> 00:35:56,825
T.M.I., mate.

517
00:36:05,617 --> 00:36:06,575
DuBois?

518
00:36:07,242 --> 00:36:08,242
Hey, Flag.

519
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,867
What the hell
are you doing here?

520
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,033
Waller told us that you were...

521
00:36:14,992 --> 00:36:15,950
Uh...

522
00:36:16,825 --> 00:36:17,950
Are you drinkin' tea?

523
00:36:18,033 --> 00:36:19,408
This is Sol Soria,

524
00:36:19,492 --> 00:36:21,075
she's the leader
of the freedom fighters,

525
00:36:21,158 --> 00:36:23,492
the resistance trying to take
down the current government.

526
00:36:23,575 --> 00:36:25,075
They saved my life.

527
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:28,367
Oh, wow.

528
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,950
Why did my people not alert me
of your arrival?

529
00:36:35,325 --> 00:36:36,575
We didn't see any people.

530
00:36:36,658 --> 00:36:37,575
Yeah, I didn't see
anybody on the way...

531
00:36:37,658 --> 00:36:38,742
There's no one out there.

532
00:36:38,825 --> 00:36:40,408
They were gone
when we got here.

533
00:36:40,492 --> 00:36:42,117
I turned them into my mother
in my head and killed them.

534
00:36:58,492 --> 00:37:03,450
Typical Americans.
Just run in, guns blazing.

535
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:05,658
I know, this is messed up.

536
00:37:05,742 --> 00:37:07,950
- These guys, they're...
- What's this one do?

537
00:37:08,908 --> 00:37:10,825
They're fucking idiots,

538
00:37:10,908 --> 00:37:14,325
but right now our objectives
align with yours.

539
00:37:15,658 --> 00:37:17,075
If Jotunheim
contains the technology

540
00:37:17,158 --> 00:37:18,617
our intelligence says it does,

541
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,575
then it could be used
on the people of Corto Maltese

542
00:37:20,658 --> 00:37:21,992
as well as Americans.

543
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:24,908
That's why we need your help

544
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,950
to get into the city
so we can stop 'em.

545
00:37:28,533 --> 00:37:30,700
Is that rat waving at me?

546
00:37:36,617 --> 00:37:37,700
It appears it is.

547
00:37:38,992 --> 00:37:40,325
Why?

548
00:37:40,408 --> 00:37:42,242
I'm gonna guess
because it's friendly.

549
00:37:45,242 --> 00:37:47,783
Luna and Suarez
murdered my entire family.

550
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,408
I'd make a deal
with the Devil to stop them.

551
00:37:55,075 --> 00:37:58,658
Your people will have our help
getting to Valle Del Mar

552
00:37:58,742 --> 00:38:03,242
to apprehend
this Gaius Grieves.

553
00:38:18,867 --> 00:38:20,033
Hey.

554
00:38:20,117 --> 00:38:22,367
- What is this?
- You slaughtered my staff!

555
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:25,200
They were loyal
to the Herreras.

556
00:38:25,283 --> 00:38:27,617
Who are you loyal to, Thinker?

557
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,367
They call you "Thinker," yes?

558
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,658
All that shit in your face
is to make your brain good?

559
00:38:33,742 --> 00:38:36,492
Yes, makes my brain good.

560
00:38:36,575 --> 00:38:38,867
Are you being sarcastic
with me?

561
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:41,367
Hey! Hey.

562
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,825
I shall do to you
as we did to your employees.

563
00:38:42,908 --> 00:38:43,825
Hey. Mateo!

564
00:38:50,617 --> 00:38:51,908
What is this?

565
00:38:54,283 --> 00:38:56,075
Project Starfish.

566
00:38:56,158 --> 00:38:58,867
It's been the primary focus
of my experiments here

567
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:01,575
for the past 30 years.

568
00:39:07,783 --> 00:39:10,533
Here.
What... What is it doing here?

569
00:39:11,158 --> 00:39:12,950
Oh!

570
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:15,450
It is having little babies.

571
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:16,867
Not progeny,

572
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,367
extensions of itself.

573
00:39:20,617 --> 00:39:22,242
They take hosts,

574
00:39:22,325 --> 00:39:25,408
and those hosts in turn become
part of the central being.

575
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,367
It feeds
on their consciousnesses.

576
00:39:31,658 --> 00:39:35,200
Grows larger, more powerful.

577
00:39:41,533 --> 00:39:42,783
So...

578
00:39:46,533 --> 00:39:48,533
where is
this Project Starfish now?

579
00:40:18,158 --> 00:40:20,075
Marvelous idea, Presidente.

580
00:40:22,117 --> 00:40:23,492
But as I've noted,

581
00:40:23,575 --> 00:40:27,117
I've been working
with the beast for 30 years.

582
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,950
And there's no one but me
capable of controlling it.

583
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,825
Well, then...

584
00:40:34,825 --> 00:40:36,242
welcome to the team.

585
00:40:43,242 --> 00:40:44,158
<i>Si,</i> Camila.

586
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:45,825
Presidente.

587
00:40:50,867 --> 00:40:52,700
You are making
a big mistake

588
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:53,908
throwing me down here!

589
00:40:53,992 --> 00:40:55,325
I will be outta here
soon enough

590
00:40:55,408 --> 00:40:58,242
and I will kill
every last one of you,

591
00:40:58,325 --> 00:41:02,200
Colto Maltese-tezios.
Maltese-els.

592
00:41:02,283 --> 00:41:04,700
Malte-multoids. Colt-a-mults?

593
00:41:04,783 --> 00:41:07,575
Whatever you <i>Mario Kart-racing</i>
d-bags are called!

594
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,950
Please.

595
00:41:10,867 --> 00:41:11,867
Put this on.

596
00:41:24,658 --> 00:41:25,950
Oh, wow.

597
00:41:30,283 --> 00:41:31,617
I'm a princess.

598
00:41:54,825 --> 00:41:56,242
<i>Senorita</i> Quinn,

599
00:41:56,325 --> 00:41:59,075
on behalf of the entire staff
of Our Honorable General

600
00:41:59,158 --> 00:42:01,283
Presidente Silvio
Eleuterio Luna,

601
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:03,075
it's a pleasure to serve you.

602
00:42:04,158 --> 00:42:05,200
<i>Gracias.</i>

603
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:10,992
My mother said
to count back again.

604
00:42:11,742 --> 00:42:13,075
Ten, nine,

605
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:15,408
eight, seven, six,

606
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:17,700
five, four, three,

607
00:42:17,783 --> 00:42:22,908
two, one. Ha!
Coronel, beat that...

608
00:42:28,617 --> 00:42:29,783
Oh.

609
00:42:29,867 --> 00:42:32,492
Forgive my appearance,
<i>Senorita</i> Quinn.

610
00:42:34,117 --> 00:42:37,158
I have admired you from afar

611
00:42:37,242 --> 00:42:38,992
for many years now.

612
00:42:40,283 --> 00:42:41,325
<i>Senorita.</i>

613
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,908
Me?

614
00:42:43,992 --> 00:42:47,200
You're a hero to me,
as well as to my people.

615
00:42:47,283 --> 00:42:49,825
I think you might
got me confused.

616
00:42:49,908 --> 00:42:51,575
Harley Quinn's fire
and rebellion

617
00:42:51,658 --> 00:42:53,158
in the face
of American oppression

618
00:42:53,242 --> 00:42:55,117
is something to which
my entire country aspires.

619
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,492
Oh.

620
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:58,033
I have prepared lunch.

621
00:42:59,742 --> 00:43:01,408
Would you be so kind
as to join me?

622
00:43:03,533 --> 00:43:05,117
I'm so kind, sure.

623
00:44:04,158 --> 00:44:05,700
You want me to what?

624
00:44:07,992 --> 00:44:09,200
To marry me.

625
00:44:09,283 --> 00:44:10,492
You're joshing.

626
00:44:11,617 --> 00:44:13,492
Might I be frank, Harley?

627
00:44:14,242 --> 00:44:15,242
You might be.

628
00:44:17,367 --> 00:44:18,742
Good, listen.

629
00:44:18,825 --> 00:44:21,658
Since I took control,
the majority love me.

630
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:25,783
But some find me to be

631
00:44:25,867 --> 00:44:27,533
an unacceptable leader.

632
00:44:27,617 --> 00:44:30,658
What kinds of dicks
would find that?

633
00:44:30,742 --> 00:44:32,950
Don't they know
how awesome you are?

634
00:44:33,033 --> 00:44:34,492
Have you shown them
the birdies?

635
00:44:34,575 --> 00:44:36,200
It may sound archaic

636
00:44:36,283 --> 00:44:38,325
to someone
from your part of the world,

637
00:44:38,408 --> 00:44:40,075
but my people,
the Corto Malteseans,

638
00:44:40,158 --> 00:44:41,742
they're very old-fashioned.

639
00:44:41,825 --> 00:44:43,617
Corto Malteseans, of course.

640
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,992
And I am a bachelor.

641
00:44:46,075 --> 00:44:47,783
So they want
you to get hitched?

642
00:44:47,867 --> 00:44:50,492
My people say you would
make the perfect wife.

643
00:44:51,325 --> 00:44:52,492
Because, you know,

644
00:44:52,575 --> 00:44:54,492
you symbolize
anti-American fervor.

645
00:44:55,992 --> 00:44:56,908
Oh.

646
00:44:57,825 --> 00:44:59,450
But I am a romantic, Harley.

647
00:45:01,158 --> 00:45:03,492
I agreed to meet with you
just to appease them.

648
00:45:04,992 --> 00:45:09,408
However, upon spending
the day with you,

649
00:45:09,492 --> 00:45:13,575
I find myself hardly able
to think straight.

650
00:45:13,658 --> 00:45:16,783
- You are perfect in every...
- You are so freaking hot.

651
00:45:41,867 --> 00:45:43,242
Harley Luna.

652
00:45:45,867 --> 00:45:47,408
I like the ring of that.

653
00:46:12,492 --> 00:46:13,950
That's Jotunheim?

654
00:46:16,367 --> 00:46:20,950
Nazis came here seeking asylum
after World War II.

655
00:46:22,492 --> 00:46:25,408
They built Jotunheim
to continue

656
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:28,825
their unorthodox experiments.

657
00:46:28,908 --> 00:46:32,575
Until the Herrera family accepted
the bounty on the Nazis' heads

658
00:46:33,492 --> 00:46:34,492
and killed them all.

659
00:46:34,575 --> 00:46:35,908
Wowza.

660
00:46:35,992 --> 00:46:39,367
Many years ago,
the rumors began of a beast.

661
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:43,367
These dark rumors helped the
Herrera family maintain power.

662
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:44,742
They would send
their political enemies

663
00:46:44,825 --> 00:46:47,075
and their families
to the fortress,

664
00:46:47,158 --> 00:46:48,492
never to return.

665
00:46:49,367 --> 00:46:53,367
I have recently learned

666
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:55,408
these were not rumors.

667
00:46:55,492 --> 00:46:57,700
They were murdering thousands

668
00:46:57,783 --> 00:47:01,283
in bizarre experiments
with this creature.

669
00:47:02,783 --> 00:47:03,867
Well, it must be a big relief

670
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:06,367
to got it
in your hands now, huh?

671
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:08,492
Absolutely.

672
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:12,033
Now, it is our enemies
who shall be fearful.

673
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:16,617
If anyone dares
to say a negative word

674
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,825
about their
new president today,

675
00:47:18,908 --> 00:47:23,742
their parents, their children,
and anyone they ever loved

676
00:47:23,825 --> 00:47:26,992
will be sent to Jotunheim
to feed the beast.

677
00:47:28,825 --> 00:47:30,200
I'm sorry.

678
00:47:33,325 --> 00:47:35,242
Recently, I made
a promise to myself

679
00:47:35,325 --> 00:47:36,742
that the next time
I got a boyfriend,

680
00:47:36,825 --> 00:47:38,450
I'd be on the lookout
for red flags.

681
00:47:38,533 --> 00:47:39,742
And if I saw any,

682
00:47:39,825 --> 00:47:41,075
I would do the healthy thing

683
00:47:42,033 --> 00:47:43,575
and I would murder him.

684
00:47:46,158 --> 00:47:47,450
And killing kids?

685
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:50,408
Kind of a red flag.

686
00:47:52,075 --> 00:47:53,200
I know, I know.

687
00:47:53,283 --> 00:47:54,367
I know what
you're tryin' to say.

688
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:56,033
"Harley, why not just leave?"

689
00:47:56,117 --> 00:47:58,117
And I'd say,
"Why are you screaming at me?

690
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,200
"I'm not deaf.
I'm standing right here."

691
00:48:00,283 --> 00:48:02,617
And then I'd say,

692
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:06,158
"When your taste in men
is as bad as mine,

693
00:48:07,492 --> 00:48:09,992
they don't just
go away quietly.

694
00:48:11,492 --> 00:48:14,158
"They slash your tires
and they kill your dogs and

695
00:48:14,242 --> 00:48:15,950
tell you
that the music you like

696
00:48:16,033 --> 00:48:17,908
ain't real music at all."

697
00:48:17,992 --> 00:48:19,075
And all the cruelty...

698
00:48:26,033 --> 00:48:27,950
...tears you apart
after a while.

699
00:48:41,075 --> 00:48:43,700
You were real pretty and all,

700
00:48:43,783 --> 00:48:47,158
and R.I.P. to that absolutely
beautiful monster

701
00:48:47,242 --> 00:48:48,617
between your legs, but...

702
00:48:49,783 --> 00:48:50,908
all in all...

703
00:48:53,075 --> 00:48:55,825
I think you're
more pretty like this,

704
00:48:55,908 --> 00:48:59,075
with all those rotten thoughts
emptied from your head.

705
00:49:02,408 --> 00:49:04,283
I can't believe
this thing had a bullet.

706
00:49:08,408 --> 00:49:11,867
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

707
00:50:28,867 --> 00:50:30,408
What the hell
are you doin'?

708
00:50:31,783 --> 00:50:34,742
We're tired,
Colonel. We need a rest.

709
00:50:34,825 --> 00:50:36,908
Goddamn hobbyists.

710
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,367
We cannot stop.

711
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:39,867
We need to hurry if you're
going to help my people.

712
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,950
Hey. We're not here
to help your people.

713
00:50:42,033 --> 00:50:44,242
But she's right,
we gotta keep moving.

714
00:50:44,325 --> 00:50:46,450
I carry friend?

715
00:50:46,533 --> 00:50:48,867
It's okay, Nanaue.

716
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,742
It's happening
to his face again.

717
00:50:53,825 --> 00:50:55,408
- It's nothing, I slipped.
- Hey...

718
00:50:55,492 --> 00:50:58,783
Norman Bates, if that shit's
contagious, we need to know.

719
00:50:58,867 --> 00:51:00,950
It's not.

720
00:51:01,033 --> 00:51:02,533
- What is it?
- It's a...

721
00:51:05,367 --> 00:51:07,242
It's an interdimensional virus.

722
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,908
Fuck is that?

723
00:51:12,117 --> 00:51:14,367
My mother was a scientist
at S.T.A.R. Labs,

724
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:15,950
and she was obsessed
with turning me

725
00:51:16,033 --> 00:51:18,450
and my brothers and sisters
into superheroes.

726
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,700
She infected me.

727
00:51:22,783 --> 00:51:25,783
Now, if I don't, you know,
expel the dots twice a day...

728
00:51:26,533 --> 00:51:27,783
Then what?

729
00:51:29,908 --> 00:51:32,950
They'll eat me alive.

730
00:51:33,033 --> 00:51:35,033
What happened
to your brothers and sisters?

731
00:51:37,575 --> 00:51:38,825
Some lived.

732
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:40,367
Some...

733
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:43,825
died.

734
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:47,533
And your mom, where is she now?

735
00:51:52,783 --> 00:51:53,950
Everywhere.

736
00:52:01,367 --> 00:52:04,367
Okay. Let's move out.

737
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:05,825
Come on,
we must hurry,

738
00:52:05,908 --> 00:52:07,908
or we'll be late
to meet my contact.

739
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:16,658
Nom, nom!

740
00:53:20,533 --> 00:53:22,283
Are you Milton?

741
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,908
<i>Si.</i>

742
00:53:29,408 --> 00:53:31,575
Milton will drive you
through town

743
00:53:31,658 --> 00:53:33,033
and to La Gatita Amable.

744
00:53:33,117 --> 00:53:34,867
There are clothes in the boxes
for all of you

745
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:36,325
so you can blend in.

746
00:53:36,408 --> 00:53:39,158
That said, the walking <i>tiburon</i>

747
00:53:39,242 --> 00:53:40,908
is gonna have
to stay out of sight.

748
00:53:40,992 --> 00:53:42,992
I wear disguise.

749
00:53:43,075 --> 00:53:46,325
Oh, you're going
to wear a disguise.

750
00:53:46,408 --> 00:53:47,283
<i>Si.</i>

751
00:53:47,367 --> 00:53:48,617
Hey, he's learnin' Spanish.

752
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,117
And what kind of disguise?

753
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,283
- Fake mustache.
- Oh.

754
00:53:53,367 --> 00:53:56,325
Yeah, fake mustache
isn't gonna cut it, mate.

755
00:54:00,533 --> 00:54:02,867
There's gonna be a lot of
soldiers watching Jotunheim.

756
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:05,450
If they discover us there...

757
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,825
Let's pray they do not,
or you will all be dead.

758
00:54:07,908 --> 00:54:09,408
If they do,

759
00:54:09,492 --> 00:54:11,242
that'll leave
the palace vulnerable.

760
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,825
Luna and the other generals

761
00:54:14,908 --> 00:54:16,325
will be left
without protection.

762
00:54:24,283 --> 00:54:26,450
You're a good man,
Colonel Flag.

763
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:32,658
You still look
exactly like yourself.

764
00:54:32,742 --> 00:54:34,325
That's the worst fake
mustache I've ever seen.

765
00:54:34,408 --> 00:54:36,992
And if you had fooled us,
we'd have to kill you,

766
00:54:37,075 --> 00:54:38,992
shark-shaped bloke
with a moustache

767
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:40,325
creeping up on us like that.

768
00:54:40,408 --> 00:54:41,700
Fuck!

769
00:54:42,908 --> 00:54:44,408
You, you.

770
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,575
Aw.

771
00:54:49,658 --> 00:54:52,658
He always wants to be near you.

772
00:54:52,742 --> 00:54:54,283
I think he senses good in you.

773
00:54:54,367 --> 00:54:56,367
Yeah, there's no good in me.

774
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,075
Damn.

775
00:55:03,158 --> 00:55:05,033
Supposed to play golf with
Senator Cray this weekend.

776
00:55:05,117 --> 00:55:06,742
I'm gonna look a fool.

777
00:55:06,825 --> 00:55:08,533
<i>Waller, come in.</i>

778
00:55:09,992 --> 00:55:11,200
Ugh.

779
00:55:11,825 --> 00:55:12,992
You missed.

780
00:55:13,075 --> 00:55:14,408
<i>Waller, do you copy?</i>

781
00:55:14,492 --> 00:55:15,867
We're losing connection.

782
00:55:17,658 --> 00:55:18,700
Waller.

783
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:22,200
Fuck's sake.

784
00:55:22,283 --> 00:55:23,908
- <i>Task Force X.</i>
- Waller.

785
00:55:23,992 --> 00:55:25,700
<i>You there?</i>

786
00:55:25,783 --> 00:55:27,033
<i>The military must have put</i>

787
00:55:27,117 --> 00:55:29,242
signal jammers around the city.

788
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:30,450
Your comms are down,

789
00:55:30,533 --> 00:55:31,867
but we can still activate
the bombs,

790
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:34,075
not to mention what will
happen to your daughter.

791
00:55:34,158 --> 00:55:36,283
So, no funny business.

792
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:37,992
<i>Do you copy, DuBois?</i>

793
00:55:38,617 --> 00:55:39,575
Copy.

794
00:55:39,658 --> 00:55:41,825
Fuck you!

795
00:55:41,908 --> 00:55:44,658
Hey, uh, all that stuff
about his daughter,

796
00:55:44,742 --> 00:55:47,408
you wouldn't
really do that, right?

797
00:55:47,492 --> 00:55:50,242
You don't know half
of what I would do, John.

798
00:56:10,908 --> 00:56:12,658
What?

799
00:56:12,742 --> 00:56:15,533
Why are you so afraid of rats?

800
00:56:18,033 --> 00:56:20,075
Why are you so in love
with them, Ratcatcher 2?

801
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:23,367
You know what I think?

802
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:25,742
I think you have a serious
case of daddy issues.

803
00:56:25,825 --> 00:56:29,325
I have no issues with
how much I loved my father.

804
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,992
Although he was a genius...

805
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:46,283
we lived homeless in the streets
of Portugal 'cause of his...

806
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:50,783
burdens.

807
00:56:53,575 --> 00:56:56,325
He built the machines
I employ today...

808
00:56:57,867 --> 00:57:00,367
...and taught me the secrets
of calling the rats.

809
00:57:04,492 --> 00:57:06,908
They brought us
trinkets to live on.

810
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,075
And they kept us warm at night,

811
00:57:10,158 --> 00:57:11,658
when we would have frozen.

812
00:57:14,908 --> 00:57:17,242
- But eventually...
- <i>Papa.</i>

813
00:57:18,117 --> 00:57:19,408
<i>Papa, wake up.</i>

814
00:57:19,492 --> 00:57:21,825
...my father's burdens

815
00:57:21,908 --> 00:57:24,325
became too heavy to carry.

816
00:57:24,408 --> 00:57:25,825
<i>No.</i>

817
00:57:25,908 --> 00:57:26,992
<i>No, Papa.</i>

818
00:57:27,075 --> 00:57:29,200
- And he was gone.
- <i>Papa, wake up.</i>

819
00:57:34,867 --> 00:57:38,200
I took his machinery
and came to America.

820
00:57:38,283 --> 00:57:39,950
That is the dream, right?

821
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:43,783
But I was arrested

822
00:57:43,867 --> 00:57:46,533
for armed bank robbery,
do you believe it?

823
00:57:46,617 --> 00:57:48,908
The state considered
the rats a weapon.

824
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:53,492
What?

825
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:58,242
You remind me of my daughter,

826
00:57:59,617 --> 00:58:00,950
the reason I'm here.

827
00:58:02,658 --> 00:58:05,367
Why are you so afraid of rats?

828
00:58:06,242 --> 00:58:07,283
My old man.

829
00:58:09,325 --> 00:58:10,450
When I was a lad,

830
00:58:10,533 --> 00:58:12,700
if I didn't finish
a task right,

831
00:58:12,783 --> 00:58:15,867
he would dole out
the punishment.

832
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:20,700
And one day, he just locked me
in a crate for 24 hours.

833
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:25,283
And it was
full of starvin' rats.

834
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,533
As imperfect my father was...

835
00:58:33,533 --> 00:58:34,742
he loved me.

836
00:58:38,992 --> 00:58:40,783
I wish I could
give that to you.

837
00:58:44,367 --> 00:58:46,325
Don't you worry, yeah?

838
00:58:46,408 --> 00:58:49,033
I'm gonna get you
out of here alive.

839
00:58:49,117 --> 00:58:51,867
I'm going to get you
out of here alive.

840
00:58:59,033 --> 00:59:02,033
<i>Senores,</i>
this is the place.

841
00:59:26,158 --> 00:59:28,575
So, when's this Thinker guy
supposed to be here?

842
00:59:28,658 --> 00:59:30,033
Supposed to be
in the next few hours.

843
00:59:30,117 --> 00:59:31,450
Looks like we gotta find
something to do

844
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:33,700
to pass the time. Uh, miss?

845
00:59:33,783 --> 00:59:35,450
How about some, uh...

846
00:59:35,533 --> 00:59:37,617
What do you guys drink
around here, Fernet?

847
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,200
How about a round of Fernets
for the table.

848
00:59:39,283 --> 00:59:40,533
- <i>Comprende?</i>
- <i>Si.</i>

849
00:59:40,617 --> 00:59:43,408
Hey, Pissmaker,
we're on a mission.

850
00:59:43,492 --> 00:59:44,992
Easy, Inspector Gadget.

851
00:59:45,075 --> 00:59:46,867
A little drink
never hurt nobody.

852
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,450
Except for
the thousands of people

853
00:59:48,533 --> 00:59:50,658
killed in drunk driving
accidents every year.

854
00:59:52,408 --> 00:59:54,117
Come on, DuBois,
this could be our last drink.

855
00:59:56,117 --> 00:59:57,575
<i>Gracias.</i>

856
00:59:57,658 --> 00:59:58,992
Just one.

857
00:59:59,075 --> 01:00:00,992
- You're gonna be that guy?
- I'm gonna be that guy.

858
01:00:02,283 --> 01:00:03,408
Hey, <i>chica.</i>

859
01:00:04,658 --> 01:00:05,783
Forgot the rat.

860
01:00:11,033 --> 01:00:13,533
Here's to being alive
in three hours.

861
01:00:13,617 --> 01:00:16,158
I'll be alive.
You speak for yourself.

862
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,325
There you go, there you go.

863
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:34,325
Don't give any more to Polka!

864
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,450
Go. Go.

865
01:02:18,033 --> 01:02:20,658
That is a gun.

866
01:02:20,742 --> 01:02:22,200
So, smile.

867
01:02:24,867 --> 01:02:27,242
We're old mates who are gonna
take a trip to Jotunheim.

868
01:02:30,283 --> 01:02:31,825
Yup.

869
01:02:31,908 --> 01:02:36,617
Even with my help, you think
you can get into Jotunheim?

870
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,408
Well, if we can't,
I've got a Great White

871
01:02:38,492 --> 01:02:40,367
out back that's looking
for some chum.

872
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:41,492
Now, come on.

873
01:02:44,283 --> 01:02:47,408
All right, nice and easy.

874
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:54,825
Oh, fuck.

875
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,492
No, no, no!

876
01:03:23,325 --> 01:03:25,033
All right...

877
01:03:25,117 --> 01:03:26,783
Take him out through the back,
all right.

878
01:03:26,867 --> 01:03:29,367
Find my coordinates in the pad
and meet me in half an hour.

879
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:31,658
- What?
- Hey, did you hear what I said?

880
01:03:31,742 --> 01:03:33,033
- Yes, but...
- Go.

881
01:03:34,742 --> 01:03:35,950
Let's go.

882
01:03:37,783 --> 01:03:41,200
Hey, calm down.

883
01:03:41,283 --> 01:03:43,325
There's no need
to disturb everyone's night.

884
01:03:43,408 --> 01:03:45,158
I'm right here, I'm the one
you're looking for.

885
01:03:45,242 --> 01:03:48,492
Yep, us too.
We're his American companions.

886
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:49,533
What?

887
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:51,742
Ow!

888
01:03:56,825 --> 01:04:00,742
- Come on. Go.
- He...

889
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,242
Oh, God.

890
01:04:05,325 --> 01:04:07,325
Move it!

891
01:04:08,367 --> 01:04:09,367
Come on!

892
01:04:10,075 --> 01:04:11,742
Hey!

893
01:04:23,658 --> 01:04:24,742
Your equipment

894
01:04:24,825 --> 01:04:26,200
manipulates
animal behavior, clever.

895
01:04:26,283 --> 01:04:28,575
I'm working on something
similar with humans.

896
01:04:28,658 --> 01:04:30,158
Be quiet, please.

897
01:04:30,242 --> 01:04:31,908
You are perceivably panicked.

898
01:04:31,992 --> 01:04:34,117
I'm guessing that you are not
the alphas of this battalion.

899
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:38,075
Do you want a dozen angry
rodents crawling up your ass?

900
01:04:38,158 --> 01:04:39,867
My answer might not
be what you expect.

901
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:43,283
Go, go!

902
01:04:57,617 --> 01:04:59,617
I'm sorry for you.

903
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:00,950
But soon
you will all be joining

904
01:05:01,033 --> 01:05:03,867
your deranged compatriot,
Harley Quinn.

905
01:05:05,658 --> 01:05:06,992
Is Harley alive?

906
01:05:07,075 --> 01:05:08,658
Not for long.

907
01:05:08,742 --> 01:05:11,325
Mayor General Suarez
can be rather harsh

908
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:13,242
when extracting information.

909
01:05:31,075 --> 01:05:32,283
<i>Dim mak.</i>

910
01:05:34,533 --> 01:05:35,992
That's
the Cantonese term for it.

911
01:05:36,075 --> 01:05:38,492
In Japan, it's <i>kyoshu jitsu.</i>

912
01:05:38,575 --> 01:05:42,742
In English,
it's simply the Death Touch,

913
01:05:42,825 --> 01:05:44,825
how to kill a man
with a single blow.

914
01:05:45,742 --> 01:05:47,575
Of course it's possible

915
01:05:47,658 --> 01:05:49,450
to kill a man
with a single blow.

916
01:05:51,075 --> 01:05:52,825
But it's a matter of chance,

917
01:05:52,908 --> 01:05:54,992
and cannot be wielded
with certainty.

918
01:05:56,408 --> 01:05:59,117
- That's what they say.
- They?

919
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,408
- Amateurs.
- On one?

920
01:06:00,492 --> 01:06:01,325
One.

921
01:06:06,325 --> 01:06:07,908
I don't smoke.

922
01:07:48,533 --> 01:07:49,658
All right.

923
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:53,450
Let's go to Jotunheim.

924
01:07:55,533 --> 01:07:56,783
Nope.

925
01:07:56,867 --> 01:07:59,117
There's somethin'
we gotta take care of first.

926
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,367
What?

927
01:08:07,325 --> 01:08:12,783
<i>♪ I ain't got nobody ♪</i>

928
01:08:12,867 --> 01:08:17,408
<i>♪ Nobody cares for me
No... ♪</i>

929
01:08:25,867 --> 01:08:28,283
I will ask again.

930
01:08:28,367 --> 01:08:30,533
How many meta-power teammates

931
01:08:30,617 --> 01:08:33,158
arrived with you
to Corto Maltese?

932
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,533
Sixty-nine.

933
01:08:36,617 --> 01:08:38,075
Sixty-nine?

934
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:40,325
How could you get
69 troops into the...

935
01:08:57,658 --> 01:09:03,700
<i>♪ I'm so sad and lonely ♪</i>

936
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:12,325
<i>♪ Won't some sweet momma
Come and rescue me... ♪</i>

937
01:09:34,325 --> 01:09:35,575
You gotta be kiddin' me.

938
01:09:35,658 --> 01:09:37,075
You're gonna risk
the entire mission

939
01:09:37,158 --> 01:09:38,950
for a mental defective
dressed as a court jester.

940
01:09:39,033 --> 01:09:40,825
This coming from a guy that
wears a toilet seat on his head.

941
01:09:40,908 --> 01:09:42,367
We don't leave
one of our own behind.

942
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:44,242
You're okay with this?

943
01:09:44,325 --> 01:09:45,742
No, but I've been around Flag
when he's got a rag in his mouth.

944
01:09:45,825 --> 01:09:47,158
- Best not to tug it.
- Motherfucker!

945
01:09:49,075 --> 01:09:50,492
Hey, wake up, wake up.

946
01:09:50,575 --> 01:09:51,867
All right, let's go.

947
01:09:55,325 --> 01:09:56,992
All right, we'll enter
through the third floor,

948
01:09:57,075 --> 01:09:59,408
go to the inner staircase,
and then down to the cellar

949
01:09:59,492 --> 01:10:00,783
where they usually
keep their detainees.

950
01:10:00,867 --> 01:10:02,867
Hopefully,
Harley's still alive.

951
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:04,992
It's not a toilet seat,
it's a beacon of freedom!

952
01:14:11,408 --> 01:14:12,533
<i>Hola.</i>

953
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:23,783
Um...

954
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:44,992
Ratatouille, what do you got?

955
01:14:46,283 --> 01:14:48,242
Third floor hallway's clear.

956
01:14:49,242 --> 01:14:50,533
Abner?

957
01:14:50,617 --> 01:14:52,575
There doesn't seem
to be any incoming traffic.

958
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:55,033
Bird.

959
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:58,742
Nanaue, stay off the comm.

960
01:15:01,533 --> 01:15:04,200
Colonel, I got a clean shot
on the only one in the office.

961
01:15:04,283 --> 01:15:05,533
Just give the word.

962
01:15:14,283 --> 01:15:16,908
Fire on three, two...

963
01:15:16,992 --> 01:15:18,408
What are you guys doing?

964
01:15:19,492 --> 01:15:22,658
I... You.
We're here to save you.

965
01:15:24,825 --> 01:15:27,200
You were gonna... save me?

966
01:15:27,283 --> 01:15:30,242
It was a really good plan, too.

967
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:32,825
Well, I can go back inside,
and you can still do it.

968
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:34,408
That's patronizing.

969
01:15:35,325 --> 01:15:36,742
Yeah, no, it's not...

970
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:40,742
Uh,
what's with the javelin?

971
01:15:40,825 --> 01:15:42,200
I'm waitin' for God to tell me.

972
01:15:42,283 --> 01:15:43,908
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah.

973
01:15:43,992 --> 01:15:47,075
Or Him. Or any of them, really.

974
01:15:47,158 --> 01:15:48,242
Okay.

975
01:15:49,117 --> 01:15:50,158
Okay.

976
01:15:51,367 --> 01:15:52,783
Are you two
all right, yeah?

977
01:15:52,867 --> 01:15:54,075
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

978
01:15:54,158 --> 01:15:55,033
Harley Quinn.

979
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:56,367
Bloodsport.

980
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:04,367
All right, who ate
all the fucking empanadas?

981
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:05,617
Mine were very good.

982
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:06,783
I had the chicken.

983
01:16:07,867 --> 01:16:09,367
All right,

984
01:16:09,450 --> 01:16:12,283
here's the deal.
We fail the mission, you die.

985
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:15,367
We find out any information
you give us is false, you die.

986
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:19,283
If we find out you have personalized
license plates, you die.

987
01:16:19,367 --> 01:16:20,450
What? No.

988
01:16:20,533 --> 01:16:22,825
If you mismatch blacks,
you die.

989
01:16:22,908 --> 01:16:24,117
No.

990
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:25,492
If you cough without
covering your mouth...

991
01:16:25,575 --> 01:16:27,450
Harley. Those last three
aren't things.

992
01:16:27,533 --> 01:16:29,575
Although, probably
don't need to say this,

993
01:16:29,658 --> 01:16:30,992
but that isn't
an open invitation

994
01:16:31,075 --> 01:16:32,658
for you to cough
without covering your mouth.

995
01:16:32,742 --> 01:16:34,450
All right, we're gonna need
you to drive the minibus,

996
01:16:34,533 --> 01:16:36,867
with all of us inside, past
the guards at the front gate.

997
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:39,783
Once through the gate, we'll use you
to get through the retinal scanner.

998
01:16:39,867 --> 01:16:41,992
There are security cameras
everywhere.

999
01:16:42,075 --> 01:16:43,533
They're being dealt with.

1000
01:16:54,408 --> 01:16:56,825
We'll neutralize the soldiers
there and enter.

1001
01:16:56,908 --> 01:16:59,492
Once we're inside,
we separate into teams.

1002
01:16:59,575 --> 01:17:01,492
I am walking back and forth.

1003
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:04,950
Okay. You're gonna lead me and
Ratcatcher 2 to Project Starfish.

1004
01:17:05,033 --> 01:17:06,867
I'm going with you
'cause I don't trust this guy.

1005
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:08,700
No, no, no,
you're coming with me.

1006
01:17:08,783 --> 01:17:11,200
Our munitions expertise are
needed to place the explosives,

1007
01:17:11,283 --> 01:17:14,200
starting at the first floor,
going all the way to the top.

1008
01:17:14,283 --> 01:17:17,242
Once we're clear, we blow
the tits off that thing,

1009
01:17:17,325 --> 01:17:18,492
and go home.

1010
01:17:19,825 --> 01:17:20,950
This is suicide.

1011
01:17:21,033 --> 01:17:22,492
Well, that's kind of our thing.

1012
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:24,700
Yeah.

1013
01:17:31,283 --> 01:17:33,117
This is insane.

1014
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,450
Yeah, no.

1015
01:18:23,367 --> 01:18:25,075
I love the rain.

1016
01:18:25,158 --> 01:18:27,742
It's like angels
are splooging all over us.

1017
01:18:27,825 --> 01:18:29,533
It's good for cover.

1018
01:18:29,617 --> 01:18:30,783
Yep, that too.

1019
01:19:46,075 --> 01:19:48,742
You son of a bit...

1020
01:20:08,117 --> 01:20:11,158
Input
the emergency code. Now!

1021
01:20:11,242 --> 01:20:12,617
Well, go on then!

1022
01:20:37,742 --> 01:20:38,700
Yo!

1023
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:41,200
Okay, Pokey.

1024
01:20:41,283 --> 01:20:43,575
You get a bomb, you get a bomb.

1025
01:20:43,658 --> 01:20:45,783
Harley and I will
meet you up on the second floor.

1026
01:20:45,867 --> 01:20:47,492
Yeah? All right.

1027
01:21:30,242 --> 01:21:32,200
God damn it,
Nanaue.

1028
01:21:33,575 --> 01:21:35,075
No!

1029
01:21:35,158 --> 01:21:36,533
Quit bein' a play baby.

1030
01:21:37,242 --> 01:21:38,783
Peacemaker.

1031
01:21:39,992 --> 01:21:41,492
It's actually very nice.

1032
01:21:41,575 --> 01:21:43,200
Just put it against the wall.

1033
01:21:45,075 --> 01:21:46,700
It looks nothin' like me.

1034
01:21:46,783 --> 01:21:48,075
Move. Move it.

1035
01:21:51,117 --> 01:21:52,242
This way.

1036
01:22:12,908 --> 01:22:14,158
<i>Si.</i>

1037
01:22:20,242 --> 01:22:22,783
<i>Vamonos. Vamonos!</i>

1038
01:23:05,075 --> 01:23:06,408
Good God.

1039
01:23:06,492 --> 01:23:07,992
If God existed,

1040
01:23:08,075 --> 01:23:10,908
wouldn't this be proof
that he wasn't good at all?

1041
01:23:11,867 --> 01:23:13,492
What the hell is this?

1042
01:23:13,575 --> 01:23:15,992
I thought you were looking
for Project Starfish.

1043
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:20,617
You've brought us visitors,
have you, Grieves?

1044
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:22,992
Have you come to save me
from that madman?

1045
01:23:23,075 --> 01:23:25,075
Thirty years he's kept me here.

1046
01:23:25,158 --> 01:23:26,783
Tortured me.

1047
01:23:26,867 --> 01:23:29,533
Had his way with me.

1048
01:24:09,242 --> 01:24:12,117
I call it Starro the Conqueror.

1049
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,950
That's meant to be derisive.

1050
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:16,158
Sorry, old chum.

1051
01:24:16,242 --> 01:24:17,742
These two are here to kill you.

1052
01:24:17,825 --> 01:24:18,950
It's out of my hands.

1053
01:24:19,033 --> 01:24:20,783
We need to help these people.

1054
01:24:20,867 --> 01:24:24,617
Impossible, dear. They're
corpses below those stars.

1055
01:24:25,408 --> 01:24:26,783
Who are they?

1056
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:30,825
The fodder of powerful men
through every age.

1057
01:24:30,908 --> 01:24:31,908
Dissidents,

1058
01:24:32,867 --> 01:24:33,908
journalists,

1059
01:24:35,033 --> 01:24:36,742
political rivals,

1060
01:24:36,825 --> 01:24:39,117
and their loved ones.

1061
01:24:41,283 --> 01:24:42,825
Oh, please,

1062
01:24:42,908 --> 01:24:46,408
unclutch your fucking pearls,
Flag.

1063
01:24:46,492 --> 01:24:48,950
We serve the same master.

1064
01:24:49,033 --> 01:24:50,783
We were sent here to stop you.

1065
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:52,825
Child,

1066
01:24:52,908 --> 01:24:54,658
your government
didn't send you here

1067
01:24:54,742 --> 01:24:57,658
to protect the world
from alien technology.

1068
01:24:57,742 --> 01:25:01,658
Your government sent you here
to cover up their part in it.

1069
01:25:01,742 --> 01:25:03,992
You're a goddamn liar.

1070
01:25:04,075 --> 01:25:08,283
American goddamn astronauts
found Starro.

1071
01:25:08,367 --> 01:25:11,033
<i>Yankee-fucking-doodle dandies.</i>

1072
01:25:11,117 --> 01:25:12,658
Although the Cold War
was ended,

1073
01:25:12,742 --> 01:25:14,867
your government
saw the potential

1074
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:17,283
in weaponizing
such a powerful beast,

1075
01:25:17,367 --> 01:25:18,825
but banish the thought

1076
01:25:18,908 --> 01:25:22,742
of any such experiments
being held on American soil.

1077
01:25:22,825 --> 01:25:25,325
Your people
have always been squeamish

1078
01:25:25,408 --> 01:25:27,825
about the sacrifices necessary

1079
01:25:28,908 --> 01:25:30,408
for scientific advancement.

1080
01:25:30,492 --> 01:25:31,492
So,

1081
01:25:32,617 --> 01:25:34,408
the United States
made a secret deal

1082
01:25:34,492 --> 01:25:36,158
with the Corto Maltese
government

1083
01:25:36,242 --> 01:25:38,825
to conduct
their illegal experiments here

1084
01:25:38,908 --> 01:25:40,200
<i>in Jotunheim.</i>

1085
01:25:40,283 --> 01:25:42,450
<i>And they hired me
to oversee them.</i>

1086
01:25:42,533 --> 01:25:44,033
And now, because of

1087
01:25:44,117 --> 01:25:46,325
a run-of-the-mill
fucking military coup,

1088
01:25:46,408 --> 01:25:48,783
they're gonna destroy
30 years' worth of efforts.

1089
01:25:48,867 --> 01:25:50,033
Yeah!

1090
01:25:50,117 --> 01:25:52,033
You're the real victim here.

1091
01:25:52,117 --> 01:25:55,033
The hell you doing here? You're supposed
to be upstairs plantin' explosives.

1092
01:25:55,117 --> 01:25:57,492
I told you I didn't trust him.

1093
01:25:57,575 --> 01:25:59,575
Your records are located
in those computers?

1094
01:26:02,533 --> 01:26:05,450
Colonel, what are you doing?

1095
01:26:05,533 --> 01:26:08,117
I joined the military
to serve my country,

1096
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,450
not to be its puppet.

1097
01:26:10,658 --> 01:26:12,408
What are you doing?

1098
01:26:15,658 --> 01:26:16,950
Who are you going
to show that to?

1099
01:26:17,033 --> 01:26:20,158
The press. Goddamn people
deserve to know.

1100
01:26:20,242 --> 01:26:22,075
I'm tired of coverin' up
their dirty little secrets.

1101
01:26:22,158 --> 01:26:24,200
This time these sons of bitches
are gonna be held account...

1102
01:26:25,492 --> 01:26:26,575
I can't let you do that,
Colonel.

1103
01:26:26,658 --> 01:26:28,325
- Excuse me?
- I'm truly sorry.

1104
01:26:28,408 --> 01:26:29,908
Miss Waller charged me
with makin' sure

1105
01:26:29,992 --> 01:26:31,575
those records
don't leave this building.

1106
01:26:31,658 --> 01:26:33,158
Of course, I shoulda known.

1107
01:26:33,242 --> 01:26:35,658
Waller's always got a backup.

1108
01:26:35,742 --> 01:26:37,492
Come on, man,
this isn't personal.

1109
01:26:37,575 --> 01:26:40,283
Holdin' a gun on me
is pretty fucking personal.

1110
01:26:41,658 --> 01:26:43,408
What is that?

1111
01:26:43,492 --> 01:26:44,825
I'm gonna need that drive,
Colonel.

1112
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:48,617
Those morons set off
the explosives too early.

1113
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:50,117
Hand over the drive!

1114
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,658
Let's go, come on!

1115
01:26:52,742 --> 01:26:53,950
They experimented on children.

1116
01:26:54,033 --> 01:26:55,992
No one is sayin'
what they did was right.

1117
01:26:56,075 --> 01:26:58,283
They experimented on children!

1118
01:26:58,367 --> 01:26:59,533
That information gets out,

1119
01:26:59,617 --> 01:27:01,450
it causes
an international incident!

1120
01:27:01,533 --> 01:27:03,742
Keepin' the peace
is worth any price,

1121
01:27:03,825 --> 01:27:06,117
including the life
of a hero like yours, sir,

1122
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:07,325
so please...

1123
01:27:09,033 --> 01:27:10,408
don't make me do this.

1124
01:27:49,533 --> 01:27:50,992
What have you people done?

1125
01:28:07,325 --> 01:28:08,533
Sebastian, come!

1126
01:28:42,367 --> 01:28:44,325
Okay, we gotta calm down.

1127
01:28:44,408 --> 01:28:46,700
Let's all just...
Let's talk about this.

1128
01:28:46,783 --> 01:28:48,533
I understand
where you're coming from.

1129
01:28:48,617 --> 01:28:49,742
I crossed a line.

1130
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:51,242
Okay, I crossed a line!

1131
01:28:51,325 --> 01:28:53,700
I realize that,
but I'm ready to change.

1132
01:28:53,783 --> 01:28:55,533
I am ready to change.

1133
01:28:55,617 --> 01:28:57,700
And I didn't
mean to hurt you...

1134
01:30:47,908 --> 01:30:49,825
You motherfucker.

1135
01:31:29,325 --> 01:31:30,575
Peacemaker.

1136
01:31:32,450 --> 01:31:33,700
What a joke.

1137
01:32:07,158 --> 01:32:08,158
Cleo.

1138
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:11,617
Give me back the drive.

1139
01:32:32,617 --> 01:32:35,492
I told you that information
can't get out. Fuck!

1140
01:32:35,575 --> 01:32:38,283
So, okay, okay,
destroy the hard drive.

1141
01:32:38,367 --> 01:32:41,075
Why kill me?

1142
01:32:46,950 --> 01:32:48,325
Because I'm thorough.

1143
01:32:50,867 --> 01:32:52,575
Oh, my...

1144
01:32:52,658 --> 01:32:54,075
Sorry, kid.

1145
01:32:54,158 --> 01:32:55,742
No, no...

1146
01:33:05,367 --> 01:33:06,783
All right, troops are coming.

1147
01:33:06,867 --> 01:33:08,908
This floor, and then
nine floors left. Let's go!

1148
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:10,658
Come on!

1149
01:34:31,367 --> 01:34:33,408
New dumb friends.

1150
01:34:46,492 --> 01:34:47,992
Aw, fizzle sticks. Hold on.

1151
01:35:15,575 --> 01:35:17,700
Has anyone got eyes
or ears on any more?

1152
01:35:17,783 --> 01:35:19,158
They killed Milton!

1153
01:35:21,283 --> 01:35:22,783
Milton was still with us?

1154
01:35:22,867 --> 01:35:24,825
- Where'd you think he was?
- I don't know.

1155
01:35:24,908 --> 01:35:26,408
I thought he stayed back
with the bus.

1156
01:35:26,492 --> 01:35:27,617
What was Milton gonna do?

1157
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:28,992
He was helping us!

1158
01:35:30,867 --> 01:35:32,117
- Who's Milton?
- What?

1159
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:33,783
I don't remember any Milton.

1160
01:35:33,867 --> 01:35:37,283
Fuck! He has been with us
the whole time.

1161
01:35:37,367 --> 01:35:40,867
Somebody named Milton has
been with us the whole time?

1162
01:35:40,950 --> 01:35:42,117
Yes!

1163
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:43,575
I don't think so.
I think I would've noticed

1164
01:35:43,658 --> 01:35:46,117
if a guy named Milton's
been with us.

1165
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:47,617
It's not a very common name.

1166
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:50,200
I don't think
I've ever even met Milton.

1167
01:35:50,283 --> 01:35:52,283
Are you messing around
right now?

1168
01:35:52,367 --> 01:35:53,950
He was a really nice guy,

1169
01:35:54,033 --> 01:35:56,867
and he sacrificed himself
to help us.

1170
01:35:56,950 --> 01:35:58,825
And now look at him.

1171
01:35:58,908 --> 01:36:00,033
He's dead.

1172
01:36:01,992 --> 01:36:06,700
Oh, that guy!
Milton, Milton.

1173
01:36:10,075 --> 01:36:12,742
So, when did this great
love affair with Milton start?

1174
01:36:12,825 --> 01:36:14,325
I liked him
from the beginning, okay?

1175
01:36:14,408 --> 01:36:15,908
I just didn't say
anything until...

1176
01:36:18,325 --> 01:36:19,742
No!

1177
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:18,158
Harley!
Give us a hand!

1178
01:38:26,158 --> 01:38:27,117
Hey!

1179
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:39,950
<i>Vamos. Vamos.</i>

1180
01:39:23,825 --> 01:39:24,950
Oh!

1181
01:40:14,492 --> 01:40:16,825
Oh, fuck, fuck.

1182
01:40:19,450 --> 01:40:21,783
Oh, fuck off!

1183
01:40:22,533 --> 01:40:23,575
Oh.

1184
01:40:43,408 --> 01:40:44,617
Sorry, kid.

1185
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:46,283
No, no, no.

1186
01:41:41,408 --> 01:41:43,033
How?

1187
01:41:43,117 --> 01:41:44,658
Smaller bullets.

1188
01:41:49,575 --> 01:41:51,617
He killed Colonel Flag.

1189
01:41:53,117 --> 01:41:55,492
He wanted to share this
with the press.

1190
01:41:55,575 --> 01:41:57,033
It's proof
the American government

1191
01:41:57,117 --> 01:42:00,075
was behind Project Starfish
the whole time.

1192
01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:36,742
Whoa. Whoa.

1193
01:42:51,325 --> 01:42:52,908
I think it's trying to get out.

1194
01:42:52,992 --> 01:42:54,783
- What?
- Starro the...

1195
01:43:17,992 --> 01:43:18,992
Whoa.

1196
01:44:27,992 --> 01:44:30,075

1200
01:45:55,908 --> 01:45:57,492
Uh... Hey, guys?

1201
01:45:59,992 --> 01:46:01,783
Oh, shit, there's...

1202
01:46:20,325 --> 01:46:22,783
This city is mine.

1203
01:46:52,908 --> 01:46:55,658
Uh, Miss Waller,
I think the feed is back up.

1204
01:46:58,492 --> 01:47:00,117
Oh, my God, Miss Waller!

1205
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:03,117
We've got a freaking <i>kaiju</i>

1208
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:19,617
Uh-huh.

1212
01:47:24,658 --> 01:47:27,408
Yeah, well, we've got a mite
issue over here, Waller.

1213
01:47:27,492 --> 01:47:29,658
It's Project Starfish,
Miss Waller.

1214
01:47:29,742 --> 01:47:31,825
It's headed towards the city,
and I think it wants

1215
01:47:31,908 --> 01:47:33,992
to feed on as many people
as it can.

1216

<i>Corto Maltese

She'll kill you, you know.

1228

That's her business.

1229
01:49:01,992 --> 01:49:04,742
I knew Sebastian sensed good
in you for a reason.

01:59:37,825 --> 01:59:38,992
Yeah.

1295
01:59:41,658 --> 01:59:43,742
Yeah.

1296
01:59:43,825 --> 01:59:46,075
<i>Oh, that's just a taste
of what's on that drive.</i>

1297
01:59:46,158 --> 01:59:48,450
<i>I've uploaded it all
to a secure server.</i>

1298
01:59:49,450 --> 01:59:51,242
<i>Now, if you kill any one of us,</i>

1299
01:59:51,325 --> 01:59:53,408
or my daughter ever sees
the inside of a prison,

1300
01:59:53,492 --> 01:59:54,783
it goes public.

1301
01:59:54,867 --> 01:59:56,450
If we all go free,

1302
01:59:56,533 --> 01:59:58,575
it never has to see
the light of day.

1303
02:00:00,158 --> 02:00:02,742
I told you I'd make you
a leader, DuBois.

1304
02:00:04,075 --> 02:00:05,325
<i>You got a deal.</i>

1305
02:00:25,575 --> 02:00:26,700
Nanaue.

1306
02:00:42,533 --> 02:00:44,908
Look, I know Flag wanted to
give the drive to the press,

1307
02:00:44,992 --> 02:00:46,992
but we just saved
a whole bloody city.

1308
02:00:47,075 --> 02:00:48,700
We can't have it all.

1309
02:00:51,700 --> 02:00:52,908
Flag was my friend.

1310
02:00:52,992 --> 02:00:54,075
Mine too.

1311
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:58,033
And I haven't got
many of those.

1312
02:01:00,492 --> 02:01:03,033
I could be your friend, Milton.

1313
02:01:03,117 --> 02:01:04,075
Not my name.

1314
02:01:04,158 --> 02:01:05,575
What?

1315
02:01:05,658 --> 02:01:07,992
What are you talkin' about?
We just had a conversation

1316
02:01:08,075 --> 02:01:10,617
for, like, three hours
about how your name is Milton.

1317
02:01:10,700 --> 02:01:11,658
Didn't.

1318
02:01:11,742 --> 02:01:13,367
Yes, we did.

1319
02:01:13,450 --> 02:01:15,450
No. Our ride's here.

1320
02:01:15,533 --> 02:01:17,450
Hmm.

1321
02:01:19,367 --> 02:01:20,658
Nom nom?

1322
02:01:20,742 --> 02:01:21,992
Really?

1323
02:01:22,075 --> 02:01:23,825
That is what you're
thinkin' about right now?

1324
02:01:23,908 --> 02:01:26,450
No. That nom nom though.

1325
02:01:26,533 --> 02:01:27,950
No, it's not nom nom.

1326
02:01:29,825 --> 02:01:30,742
No!

1327
02:10:54,867 --> 02:10:56,617
Said they found him
in the rubble.

1328
02:10:56,700 --> 02:10:58,700
They were shocked
his heart was still beating.

1329
02:10:58,783 --> 02:11:00,158
I wasn't certain
how safe it was,

1330
02:11:00,242 --> 02:11:01,533
shipping him back here.

1331
02:11:01,617 --> 02:11:04,742
But, if anything,
he's shown he's resilient.

1332
02:11:04,825 --> 02:11:06,075
It'll take some surgery,

1333
02:11:06,158 --> 02:11:07,700
but eventually we'll get him
back up to speed.

1334
02:11:10,158 --> 02:11:12,075
You realize
this is revenge, right?

1335
02:11:12,158 --> 02:11:13,908
Waller knows
we double-crossed her,

1336
02:11:13,992 --> 02:11:15,200
and she's getting back at us

1337
02:11:15,283 --> 02:11:17,283
by saddling us
with this douchebag.

1338
02:11:17,367 --> 02:11:18,742
Yep.

1339
02:11:18,825 --> 02:11:20,992
I heard he was sort of a hero
down in Corto Maltese.

1340
02:11:21,075 --> 02:11:23,450
Oh, is that what you heard?
Because not quite.

1341
02:11:25,367 --> 02:11:27,950
What do you guys
want him for?

1342
02:11:28,033 --> 02:11:30,825
Just to save
the fucking world, that's all.
