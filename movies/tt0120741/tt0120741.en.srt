<i>Life's an enigma, a puzzle, a confusing
struggle between right and wrong...</i>

3
00:00:21,644 --> 00:00:24,004
<i>good and evil, truth and deceit.</i>

4
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:26,974
<i>You could drive yourself
crazy trying to figure it out.</i>

5
00:00:27,175 --> 00:00:29,469
<i>But I know one thing for sure:</i>

6
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,646
<i>You're just buying someone else's
headaches when you get a used car.</i>

7
00:01:10,722 --> 00:01:14,582
<i># Stop that run! Stop that run! #</i>

8
00:01:45,342 --> 00:01:48,260
<i># Night and day #</i>

<i># You are the one #</i>

- <i># Only you beneath the moon #
- Before I got myself blown up...</i>

11
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,564
<i>Anthony Cortino was one of the
most powerful men in Las Vegas.</i>

12
00:01:59,565 --> 00:02:04,102
<i>I ran the Peppermill, the flashiest,
most profitable casino in Nevada.</i>

13
00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:06,354
Hey, Barry. Keep the car.

14
00:02:06,355 --> 00:02:09,524
<i>I drove the hottest cars, hung
out with the biggest stars...</i>

15
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:10,993
<i>dated the sexiest babes.</i>

16
00:02:10,994 --> 00:02:12,053
Watch your head.

17
00:02:12,054 --> 00:02:16,200
- <i>I was set.
- # Night and day #</i>

18
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:19,293
- <i># Why is it so #
- I had created paradise on Earth...</i>

19
00:02:19,294 --> 00:02:22,371
<i>and all because I ate,
slept and breathed gambling.</i>

20
00:02:22,372 --> 00:02:24,040
Hi.

21
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,825
- Loser. Seven out.
- Stack 'em right.

22
00:02:25,826 --> 00:02:29,671
<i>I was a gambler's gambler...
a guaranteed winner.</i>

23
00:02:29,672 --> 00:02:32,966
- <i>That's just the way it was.</i>
- Go fish.

24
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:36,928
<i>The Peppermill meant cash. The money
was comin' in so fast we couldn't count it.</i>

25
00:02:36,929 --> 00:02:39,640
Watch these guys. I think
they're stealin' towels.

26
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:43,435
- <i>And it all went right to the family, tax-free.
- Back to yellow. You lose.</i>

27
00:02:43,436 --> 00:02:47,064
<i>The high rollers, the slot junkies,
the vacationers from the Midwest...</i>

28
00:02:47,065 --> 00:02:49,876
<i>all came certain they could win...</i>

29
00:02:49,877 --> 00:02:53,279
- <i>that this was their shot at a miracle.</i>
- Place your bets.

30
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,074
<i>It's all been arranged just
for us to get your money.</i>

31
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:59,410
Let me see. Uh, two.

32
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:01,613
<i>That's the truth about Las Vegas:</i>

33
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:05,167
I'm sorry. I was thinking of three.

34
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:07,629
<i>The Mafia is a high-overhead machine,</i>

35
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,400
- <i>and somebody's gotta pick up the tab.</i>
- House wins. Place your bets and guess again.

36
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:15,135
- Three.
- <i>To the bosses, I was a cash register.</i>

37
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:17,722
<i>All they had to do was to ring
the bell and take the money.</i>

38
00:03:17,723 --> 00:03:20,391
One, two, three, four.

39
00:03:20,392 --> 00:03:22,593
- Back down the chute.
- Whoa!

40
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:26,189
<i>Fixed fights, doped horses,
locked-in point spreads.</i>

41
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,566
- <i>I had the cake pouring in.</i>
- Come on, baby!

42
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:31,987
<i>But nothing brought it in faster and
in bigger bundles than the casino.</i>

43
00:03:31,988 --> 00:03:34,114
- I'll get these. You get those.
- I'll get those! You got those?

44
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:35,127
Yeah. You get these over here.

45
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:37,150
- All right, I got these.
- Whose are those?

46
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:41,288
<i>This was the end result of all
of the bright lights and glitter.</i>

47
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:43,256
<i>Booze, broads and free hotel suites...</i>

48
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:45,042
- <i>...for the high roller...</i>
- Put your backs to it, men.

49
00:03:45,043 --> 00:03:49,881
<i>cheap drinks and all-you-can-eat
buffets for the everyday sucker.</i>

50
00:03:49,882 --> 00:03:54,377
<i>The smart ones just send us the
money and save on plane fare.</i>

51
00:03:54,378 --> 00:03:57,013
<i># I think of you #</i>

52
00:03:57,014 --> 00:04:00,058
<i># Day and night #</i>

53
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:03,395
<i># I said, night and day #</i>

54
00:04:03,396 --> 00:04:07,441
<i># Under the hide of me #</i>

55
00:04:07,442 --> 00:04:10,486
- All right, move' em out. Let's go.
- There's, oh, such a hungry yearnin'

56
00:04:10,487 --> 00:04:12,571
<i># It's burnin' inside #</i>

57
00:04:12,572 --> 00:04:15,491
<i>If we had our own printing press
we couldn't have done any better.</i>

58
00:04:15,492 --> 00:04:20,246
<i>I made the Mafia happy, and the bosses
knew just how to spread the influence.</i>

59
00:04:20,247 --> 00:04:23,583
<i>But life is an enigma. I
never planned for any of this.</i>

60
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:26,252
<i>And I'll lay you eight-to-five
when he was a kid back in Sicily...</i>

61
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:28,797
<i>my father, Vincenzo Cortino...</i>

62
00:04:28,798 --> 00:04:32,389
<i>never thought his life would
turn out the way it did either.</i>

63
00:04:44,047 --> 00:04:45,530
<i>Vincenzo!</i>

64
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,508
Oops.

65
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:57,026
Wow! The colours! Great shit!

66
00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:15,601
The categories are: the Chinese Theatre,

67
00:09:15,602 --> 00:09:17,914
<i>Female Firsts...</i>

68
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:06,931
<i>Documents, please.</i>

69
00:15:06,932 --> 00:15:11,937
- <i>The white zone is for white people only.</i>
- That's right, one at a time. Papers, please.

70
00:15:11,938 --> 00:15:14,231
- Move along, sir.
- But we had reservations.

71
00:15:14,232 --> 00:15:16,733
Next. Name?

72
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:19,361
- <i>That's right, ma'am, your name.
- Sir, over here.</i>

73
00:15:19,362 --> 00:15:22,364
What's your name, boy?

74
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:25,341
- <i>Step up, please.
- You next.</i>

75
00:15:27,296 --> 00:15:30,706
- Armani Windbreaker.
- Cortino.

76
00:15:30,707 --> 00:15:35,962
Fine. Read this. Stand over there.

77
00:15:35,963 --> 00:15:38,725
- Next.
- <i>Clamato!</i>

78
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:42,636
Dominick Clamato!

79
00:15:42,637 --> 00:15:45,222
I'm lookin' for Dominick Clamato!

80
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:48,225
- <i>Sweat shop. Cheap wages.
- Clamato!</i>

81
00:15:48,226 --> 00:15:52,021
<i>I'm lookin' for Dominick Clamato!</i>

82
00:15:52,022 --> 00:15:56,325
- Don't say nothin'.
- <i>Dominick Clamato!</i>

83
00:16:01,323 --> 00:16:03,433
Gun.

84
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:16,922
- Where is your family?
- Family? No.

85
00:16:16,923 --> 00:16:20,467
- Alone.
- That is so sad.

86
00:16:20,468 --> 00:16:24,653
But when I close my eyes
tight I can picture them here.

87
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,369
When you squeeze your eyes closed,
do you see lots of things, eh...

88
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,888
- Rectangles?
- <i>No.</i>

89
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:43,033
All I ever see are those long, floaty things.

90
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:45,077
Ah. Eye worms.

91
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:47,371
In Sicily the peasants used to get them...

92
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:50,249
<i>by eating raw pork and then rubbing their eyes.</i>

93
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,418
<i>Once the worms get inside your eyeball...</i>

94
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:56,239
it's just a matter of days before
they eat their way into your brain.

95
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,144
Then you shit yourself and die
in a most embarrassing way.

96
00:17:01,545 --> 00:17:04,715
<i>Rosa was not very attractive
by ltalian standards.</i>

97
00:17:04,716 --> 00:17:07,842
- <i>Rosa, come.
- Hardly any body hair.</i>

98
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:10,156
<i>Come on.</i>

99
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:20,917
Next.

100
00:17:31,252 --> 00:17:35,342
Thanks for carryin' my
luggage, pal. I'll take my gun.

101
00:17:39,877 --> 00:17:42,846
Don't be a fool. Cops don't help our kind.

102
00:17:42,847 --> 00:17:46,357
In this country, we gotta
look out for ourselves.

103
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,982
- No!
- Give me your money. Give me your money!

104
00:17:52,983 --> 00:17:57,478
- Use the gun.
- No. I will use my brain. It is as big as any bullet.

105
00:17:57,479 --> 00:18:02,212
- You won't look so pretty without a nose.
- <i>Why don't you pick a nose your own size?</i>

106
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:08,373
Look at you. You're just a boy.

107
00:18:08,374 --> 00:18:10,926
Think you can stop me? How?

108
00:18:10,927 --> 00:18:13,838
- I'll outsmart you.
- <i>Oh, yeah?</i>

109
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:17,867
<i>Then answer me this: A rooster
sits on the peak of a roof.</i>

110
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:21,554
It lays an egg. Which side
will the egg roll down?

111
00:18:21,555 --> 00:18:24,815
The left... No, the right.

112
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:32,697
- I don't know.
- Neither, my friend. Roosters don't lay eggs.

113
00:18:37,656 --> 00:18:40,366
<i>This was no ordinary kid.</i>

114
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:44,453
<i>I had a feeling we'd be
seeing a lot of each other.</i>

115
00:18:44,454 --> 00:18:47,050
Stay in school.

116
00:18:56,217 --> 00:18:59,052
Thank you. I don't even know your name.

117
00:18:59,053 --> 00:19:04,308
Uh, Vincenzo. Vincenzo Armani
Windbreaker Cortino. You?

118
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:08,479
I'm Rosa Versace Blue Blazer
And Matching Skirt Pantuzzi.

119
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,440
- Are you from Sicily too?
- No. Milano.

120
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,693
My father was in the military. A lancer.

121
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:18,114
- Bengal Lancer?
- No, a boil lancer. One of the best.

122
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:22,952
But then one day there were no more boils.

123
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:27,341
He turned to drink. We lost
him at a Grateful Dead concert.

124
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,048
Look! A falling star!

125
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:38,969
They say that if two people meeting for
the first time see a falling star...

126
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,973
their wish will come true.

127
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:44,486
Make a wish, Vincenzo.

128
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:56,873
<i>I believe in America.</i>

129
00:19:57,156 --> 00:20:01,418
<i>I raised my daughter in American fashion.</i>

130
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:05,564
<i>One day she went to see a man.</i>

131
00:20:05,565 --> 00:20:09,544
<i>He got her alone in a room.</i>

132
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:12,839
Held her down in a chair.

133
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,343
When she resisted, he stuck her with a needle.

134
00:20:17,344 --> 00:20:20,513
<i>Then, when she was helpless...</i>

135
00:20:20,514 --> 00:20:23,228
<i>he took pliers and...</i>

136
00:20:24,936 --> 00:20:29,156
Look at her, Don Cortino. Look.

137
00:20:31,276 --> 00:20:35,321
I'm familiar with this Dr Mendelbaum.
He's not a dentist, he's a butcher.

138
00:20:35,322 --> 00:20:38,199
<i>Put caps on the Turteltaub twins.</i>

139
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,453
I saw them. They looked like beavers.

140
00:20:42,454 --> 00:20:45,790
In fact, I have a cord of wood they cut.

141
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,636
I'm all set for the winter.

142
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,384
Whoopsy-daisy!

143
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:56,103
Ah. I found my keys.

144
00:20:59,055 --> 00:21:01,484
<i>I must own a car.</i>

145
00:21:05,145 --> 00:21:08,272
A beautiful girl, Don Cortino.

146
00:21:08,273 --> 00:21:12,443
<i>A daughter who has brought only
happiness into our home for 17 years.</i>

147
00:21:12,444 --> 00:21:15,921
<i>Horrible. Can't really blame the boy.</i>

148
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,388
Die, you bastard.

149
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:33,788
<i>What is it you request?</i>

150
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:50,620
Uh, that's my bad ear.

151
00:22:05,334 --> 00:22:09,092
No, I was wrong. This must be the bad ear.

152
00:22:12,425 --> 00:22:16,970
Don Cortino, I want justice for my Angelina.

153
00:22:16,971 --> 00:22:20,315
All right, Bonifacio, all right.

154
00:22:22,018 --> 00:22:24,863
I will do this thing for you.

155
00:22:26,148 --> 00:22:28,660
<i>Thank you, Godfather.</i>

156
00:22:33,989 --> 00:22:36,585
Thank you.

157
00:22:38,202 --> 00:22:41,329
<i>Diane was my first love. We
were made for each other.</i>

158
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:44,750
<i>About the only disagreement we
ever had was when I went to war.</i>

159
00:22:44,751 --> 00:22:48,170
<i>While I was off fighting, she was
working for the world peace movement.</i>

160
00:22:48,171 --> 00:22:52,258
<i>But despite all that, when I got
home she was there to greet me.</i>

161
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:55,400
<i>I guess she was a sucker for a guy in uniform.</i>

162
00:22:57,139 --> 00:23:00,141
Oh, Anthony, I'm so nervous
about meeting your family.

163
00:23:00,142 --> 00:23:04,196
- If they don't like me, I'll just die.
- <i>Hey! Tony!</i>

164
00:23:05,523 --> 00:23:07,739
Big war hero.

165
00:23:10,528 --> 00:23:13,447
- I got you a souvenir.
- No.

166
00:23:13,448 --> 00:23:17,242
Oh, wow. A North Korean.

167
00:23:17,243 --> 00:23:21,163
Tony... I mean, I do...
I don't know what to say.

168
00:23:21,164 --> 00:23:26,294
I want you to meet Diane. Diane, this is Dominick
Clamato, my father's most trusted friend.

169
00:23:26,295 --> 00:23:28,463
- Hi.
- Bella.

170
00:23:28,464 --> 00:23:31,059
Lugosi.

171
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:38,306
Hey, you guys, look at what Tony brung me.

172
00:23:38,307 --> 00:23:40,642
I'll bet you never seen one of these before.

173
00:23:40,643 --> 00:23:44,855
Anthony, isn't that Cesar Marzoni? The
man's a criminal. What's he doing here?

174
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,399
<i>Maybe he does business with my father.</i>

175
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,761
<i>What are you saying?</i>

176
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,990
Look, I'm not my father, Diane,
just as you're not your father.

177
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:57,618
If we were our fathers, what we did last
night would only be legal in Arkansas.

178
00:23:57,619 --> 00:23:59,947
Hmm.

179
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:03,208
Some champagne, sir?

180
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,710
<i>It was like I never left.</i>

181
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:08,213
- <i>These were the faces I grew up with.</i>
- Good to see you, Anthony.

182
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:10,966
<i>It wasn't just me and Joey and Pop.</i>

183
00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:13,385
- <i>It was Frankie Totino,</i>
- Look who's here.

184
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:17,097
Hey, Anthony, welcome back.

185
00:24:17,098 --> 00:24:19,734
- <i>"Fatso" Paulie Orsatti,
- Try the veal picatta.</i>

186
00:24:19,735 --> 00:24:22,895
<i>who was Benny "Big Features"
brother... he controlled the unions.</i>

187
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:24,336
<i>Then you had Nick Molinaro,</i>

188
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:26,983
- <i>who ran the North Side</i>
- Hey! How ya doin'?

189
00:24:26,984 --> 00:24:29,527
<i>Jumbo "The King of Big Screen TV" DeNuzio.</i>

190
00:24:29,528 --> 00:24:33,156
Yo, Tony, I'll knock 20 percent
off that Trinitron for you.

191
00:24:33,157 --> 00:24:36,326
- <i>There was Al "The Mailbox" Faducci,
- Miller Lite.</i>

192
00:24:36,327 --> 00:24:38,579
- <i>Johnny Love...</i>
- Who's the pretty girl?

193
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,098
<i>and Charlie "Big Red-Ass
Baboon On His Head" Petrella.</i>

194
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:43,560
Catch you later.

195
00:24:44,261 --> 00:24:46,973
<i>The Don'll see you now, Mr Gorgoni.</i>

196
00:24:52,353 --> 00:24:56,055
- <i>Pop, this is Sal Gorgoni.</i>
- Don Cortino.

197
00:24:56,056 --> 00:24:58,608
It is a honour to be in the
presence of such a great man.

198
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:02,562
Your flattery brings a redness to my hair.

199
00:25:02,563 --> 00:25:04,860
Cigar?

200
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:07,685
<i>Very fresh.</i>

201
00:25:08,486 --> 00:25:11,447
Uh, thank you, no.

202
00:25:11,448 --> 00:25:13,933
Please, sit down.

203
00:25:14,534 --> 00:25:17,495
Now, what is so urgent that
you've come to see Don Corduroy...

204
00:25:17,496 --> 00:25:21,874
on the third anniversary of
my stepson's liposuction?

205
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:26,296
It is a known fact that you
have the judges in your pocket.

206
00:25:26,297 --> 00:25:29,591
The politicians, they dance like...

207
00:25:29,592 --> 00:25:32,319
<i>like puppets for you.</i>

208
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,137
You control the courts.

209
00:25:34,138 --> 00:25:38,275
If you agree to share your influence...

210
00:25:38,276 --> 00:25:40,528
I will make you a partner in my new business.

211
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:44,482
Suck my big ltalian sausage, you magootza.

212
00:25:44,483 --> 00:25:47,026
<i>You make us partner?</i>

213
00:25:47,027 --> 00:25:49,290
<i>You'll have to excuse my son.</i>

214
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:54,117
<i>
Now, what sort of business are we talking about?</i>

215
00:25:54,118 --> 00:25:56,837
I can make us bigger than the Almighty Himself.

216
00:25:56,838 --> 00:26:02,709
Shut your slimy guinea pazatz!
Nobody's bigger than Sinatra!

217
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:07,256
<i>Joey's a good boy, but there's always been
something about his personality that, uh...</i>

218
00:26:07,257 --> 00:26:09,800
<i>How shall I put it? He's fuckin' nuts.</i>

219
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:14,968
This was brought in at great expense
from our friends in America Del Sur.

220
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:22,021
Ah! Nondairy creamer. Good investment.

221
00:26:22,022 --> 00:26:24,875
Drugs, Don Cortino.

222
00:26:25,276 --> 00:26:30,572
<i>I thank you for your offer, Mr
Gorgoni, but, well, answer me this:</i>

223
00:26:30,573 --> 00:26:33,242
<i>Where is the future of this business?</i>

224
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:36,662
Drugs don't taste good. You
can't put them on cereal.

225
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:40,009
<i>Why would anyone want to
invest in something like that?</i>

226
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:44,704
I hope you don't live to regret
this decision, Don Cortino.

227
00:26:44,705 --> 00:26:49,441
Now, if we're finished, I'd like to get
back to my stepdaughter's coronation.

228
00:27:07,487 --> 00:27:09,655
Godfather.

229
00:27:09,656 --> 00:27:13,360
- Congratulations.
- Oh.

230
00:27:13,661 --> 00:27:16,112
Hey, Pop.

231
00:27:16,613 --> 00:27:20,667
Hey. I missed you, son.

232
00:27:20,668 --> 00:27:24,838
- I missed you too, Pop.
- How was the war? Did you have fun?

233
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:27,435
I want you to meet Diane.

234
00:27:28,843 --> 00:27:31,387
- Hi.
- Oh.

235
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:33,439
Tastes like chicken.

236
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,310
- Tony!
- Hey!

237
00:27:37,311 --> 00:27:40,104
My big brother got married, huh? Who is she?

238
00:27:40,105 --> 00:27:43,191
Ah, some ltalian girl. Who's this?

239
00:27:43,192 --> 00:27:46,069
Oh, this is Diane. We went to Vassar together.

240
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:49,239
Hi, Joey. Anthony's told me so much about you.

241
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,908
Psychopath, right?

242
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:54,007
- Yeah.
- Hey!

243
00:27:56,956 --> 00:28:00,584
- Oh, he seems so nice, honey.
- Get back here. I'll shoot you in the face!

244
00:28:00,585 --> 00:28:02,711
Easy, Joey. Easy. Easy. Easy.

245
00:28:02,712 --> 00:28:05,840
Guido. Say hello to Guido.

246
00:28:05,841 --> 00:28:08,134
Hey, scunge, say hello to my present.

247
00:28:08,135 --> 00:28:11,158
- How ya doin'?
- That's somethin', huh?

248
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:16,685
Don Cortino, Don Marzoni from Las Vegas.

249
00:28:16,686 --> 00:28:20,864
Don Cortino. You honour me
by inviting me to your home.

250
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:24,359
I've heard great things about
what you're doing in Las Vegas.

251
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,839
<i>You know, you look familiar.</i>

252
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,993
Uh, this is a friend of mine, Pepper Giannini.

253
00:28:31,994 --> 00:28:35,288
Mmm. Giannini. Any Sicilian in you?

254
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:38,549
Not since last night.

255
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:53,215
Marriage. The bond that binds us together.

256
00:28:53,216 --> 00:28:58,470
Myself, I've been married to the
same wonderful woman for 42 years.

257
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:03,284
Of course, sex stopped for us
about a week after the wedding...

258
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:05,319
<i>as it should.</i>

259
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:10,909
I love my Rosa as much today as I did
the first time I forced myself on her.

260
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:14,329
But, uh, how 'bout this one here?

261
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,999
Breasts like cabbages.

262
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,787
And how about that ass? You
could play canasta on it.

263
00:29:21,788 --> 00:29:24,381
<i>So, Joey...</i>

264
00:29:24,382 --> 00:29:28,770
remember this old Sicilian proverb:

265
00:29:28,771 --> 00:29:31,815
"Man is like a piece of cheese."

266
00:29:37,521 --> 00:29:40,034
<i>Hear, hear!</i>

267
00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:47,145
- Piece of cheese?
- Piece of cheese.

268
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,222
Say hello to my little friend.

269
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:47,211
- <i>What the hell's that?
- That's the jitterbug, guys. Come on. Jitterbug.</i>

270
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,177
<i>Keep up, keep up.</i>

271
00:30:53,969 --> 00:30:56,281
Wow!

272
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:09,836
<i>What's he doin' now?</i>

273
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:42,241
No!

274
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:43,342
<i>After the attack on Pop, Joey was on
a rampage. He was ready to go to war.</i>

275
00:32:43,343 --> 00:32:47,980
<i>So we brought in some strong-arm
goons from out of town.</i>

276
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:55,605
<i>Pop was in and out of consciousness...</i>

277
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:58,692
<i>and when he was awake he seemed
to have lost his will to live.</i>

278
00:32:58,693 --> 00:33:02,529
No doctors? No nurses? There's...
There's no one here to help him.

279
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:06,289
- Diane, he belongs to an HMO.
- Oh.

280
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:14,597
- Is he okay?
- Pop. My God. Pop!

281
00:33:16,503 --> 00:33:18,921
I had a dog dream.

282
00:33:18,922 --> 00:33:22,509
<i>Anthony, I always knew I could count on you.</i>

283
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:25,471
Well, we've been here every day.

284
00:33:25,972 --> 00:33:28,807
Really? So have I.

285
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:30,767
Come close.

286
00:33:30,768 --> 00:33:33,729
Uh, Diane, could you excuse us for a minute?

287
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:37,686
Oh, sure. If you need me,
I'll be up on the bidet.

288
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:42,363
- How bad is it? The truth.
- <i>You're gonna be okay.</i>

289
00:33:42,364 --> 00:33:45,375
- You lost a lot of blood, but we found most of it.
- Yeah.

290
00:33:46,952 --> 00:33:49,464
This just arrived.

291
00:33:52,917 --> 00:33:57,421
Oh, a carp. How thoughtful.
Fish sticks for everybody.

292
00:33:57,422 --> 00:34:01,719
No, Pop, it's a message. "Oyster
Jimmy sleeps with the fishes."

293
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,224
Well, I hope he's using protection. Good-looking
fella like that could have any woman he wanted.

294
00:34:08,225 --> 00:34:10,737
<i>Present company included.</i>

295
00:34:17,818 --> 00:34:20,320
Pop, somebody's out to get
us and we don't know who.

296
00:34:20,321 --> 00:34:22,656
Can you think of anybody, Pop? Anybody?

297
00:34:22,657 --> 00:34:27,077
Well, there is a man. He has only one thumb.

298
00:34:27,078 --> 00:34:30,581
<i>It matches this.</i>

299
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:35,136
We used to just steal things,
kill and dismember people.

300
00:34:35,137 --> 00:34:39,766
Now it's all drugs. Oh, where is the honour?

301
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:42,343
Why go on?

302
00:34:42,344 --> 00:34:46,406
I brought somebody to cheer you up, Pop.

303
00:34:46,807 --> 00:34:49,868
Mama?

304
00:34:50,269 --> 00:34:52,771
Mama.

305
00:34:52,772 --> 00:34:56,775
Look what they did to my boy.

306
00:34:56,776 --> 00:35:01,405
Oh, my sweet Vincenzo.

307
00:35:01,406 --> 00:35:05,196
I kept your ring for you, Mama. Here.

308
00:35:07,496 --> 00:35:09,708
Let me.

309
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,725
<i>It's stuck. I can't get it off.</i>

310
00:35:24,347 --> 00:35:28,142
- You. Whose kid are you? Huh?
- Here you go, Paulie.

311
00:35:28,143 --> 00:35:30,728
Gino, don't eat so fast.
God'll give you a tumour.

312
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:34,532
Hey, Ma, lay off the kid.
Slow down. You gotta digest.

313
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:36,822
Gorgoni wouldn't try to kill Pop
just 'cause he insulted him.

314
00:35:36,823 --> 00:35:38,569
There's gotta be more to it than that.

315
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,156
It had to be Gorgoni. I say we whack him.

316
00:35:41,157 --> 00:35:44,192
- Don't talk business at the table.
- This shirt is stranglin' me.

317
00:35:44,193 --> 00:35:47,037
- I told you I'd take it back.
- It makes me nuts, the way you shop.

318
00:35:47,038 --> 00:35:50,264
Ooh! ltalian food.

319
00:35:51,918 --> 00:35:55,229
<i>What, you think Gorgoni wants to
take over the family? Come on!</i>

320
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:58,991
- He ain't got the cogliones for that.
- Maybe somebody bigger ordered the hit, Joey.

321
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:02,787
I told you, not at the table.
You wanna bring a pox?

322
00:36:02,788 --> 00:36:06,557
<i>Gorgoni will not stop until Pop
is dead. We gotta have a war.</i>

323
00:36:06,558 --> 00:36:08,726
Kill every one of those rat-lickin' basserinos.

324
00:36:08,727 --> 00:36:15,275
Tie his steaming intestines to a
runaway horse and yank 'em out his ass!

325
00:36:15,276 --> 00:36:18,070
- Who wants tea?
- Don't reach.

326
00:36:18,071 --> 00:36:19,162
Hey!

327
00:36:19,163 --> 00:36:21,857
Don't say "Hey!" to your
grandma. Show some respect.

328
00:36:21,858 --> 00:36:25,578
I'm gonna get some tea. Sure nobody want none?

329
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:30,224
I tell ya how I'm gonna settle our differences.
I'm gonna shoot the guy right in the lombardos.

330
00:36:30,225 --> 00:36:32,143
Goddam it, I said not in front of the kids.

331
00:36:32,144 --> 00:36:36,422
Just once I'd like to see ya buy
somethin' without havin' to exchange it.

332
00:36:36,423 --> 00:36:38,883
Twenty-four years I'm married.

333
00:36:38,884 --> 00:36:41,378
I coulda shot her and been
out on parole 14 years.

334
00:36:41,379 --> 00:36:43,978
I'll do it. I'll kill Gorgoni.

335
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:49,561
You? College boy?

336
00:36:49,562 --> 00:36:51,730
It's just business.

337
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:56,878
We'll set up a meeting someplace
public, like a roller rink or a boutique.

338
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:00,373
I'll kill Gorgoni myself.

339
00:37:03,452 --> 00:37:07,376
- Diane.
- Cut off her feet and make soup.

340
00:37:09,584 --> 00:37:11,952
Diane.

341
00:37:12,253 --> 00:37:16,632
Anthony, do you remember when we were
in college, before you were drafted?

342
00:37:16,633 --> 00:37:20,261
We said that we were gonna dedicate
our lives to, to ending war...

343
00:37:20,262 --> 00:37:22,972
to bringing peace to the world.

344
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:26,309
- What happened to that?
- World peace?

345
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,853
Don't be so naive, Diane.

346
00:37:28,854 --> 00:37:33,233
Besides, I can't turn my back on Pop
and Joey. They're like family to me.

347
00:37:33,234 --> 00:37:36,611
Anthony, they're criminals. They're murderers.

348
00:37:36,612 --> 00:37:39,448
Criminals are people too, Diane.

349
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:43,654
If you prick a murderer,does he not leave a blood
trail all the way back to his Rockingham estate?

350
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:49,250
This is that whole Sicilian thing, isn't it?

351
00:37:49,251 --> 00:37:51,335
I'll never belong, Anthony.

352
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:55,521
I'm always just gonna be that Protestant
chick who never killed anyone.

353
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,286
<i>All right, let's go over it again.</i>

354
00:38:01,287 --> 00:38:04,992
<i>Now, you kill him after the
main course. Salad's too soon.</i>

355
00:38:04,993 --> 00:38:10,581
<i>And then somethin' light for dessert.
Maybe a sorbet or some kiwi.</i>

356
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:13,676
<i>Frankie'll stash the pistol
in the bathroom for ya.</i>

357
00:38:13,677 --> 00:38:17,154
<i>He'll put the gun in the
stall behind the flush tank.</i>

358
00:38:17,155 --> 00:38:20,296
<i>Hey, don't worry, Anthony. You'll do okay.</i>

359
00:38:21,785 --> 00:38:24,537
Anthony. Benvenuto.

360
00:38:24,538 --> 00:38:26,577
<i>He's gonna frisk you.</i>

361
00:38:27,444 --> 00:38:28,781
<i>Turn your head.</i>

362
00:38:29,168 --> 00:38:31,419
Cough.

363
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,713
He's clean.

364
00:38:33,714 --> 00:38:36,310
- And April fresh.
- Sit.

365
00:38:40,355 --> 00:38:43,482
I'm gonna speak ltalian to Anthony.

366
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:16,477
"Lyle Menendez"? Come on.

367
00:39:27,438 --> 00:39:29,321
<i>Come on!</i>

368
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,812
El Nino.

369
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,291
Okay.

370
00:40:10,692 --> 00:40:13,204
Oh!

371
00:40:19,034 --> 00:40:21,301
<i>Lou Ferrigno?</i>

372
00:40:53,029 --> 00:40:56,307
So, Anthony...

373
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,962
<i>Can we do business?</i>

374
00:41:02,122 --> 00:41:04,334
<i>Anthony?</i>

375
00:41:08,128 --> 00:41:10,640
I can hear the ocean.

376
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:30,234
<i>My life had come to this.</i>

377
00:41:30,235 --> 00:41:32,736
<i>The little crippled kid they
used to call "Tiny Anthony"...</i>

378
00:41:32,737 --> 00:41:35,406
<i>who had sold flowers on the street corner...</i>

379
00:41:35,407 --> 00:41:38,548
<i>had grown up to be a killer.</i>

380
00:41:43,707 --> 00:41:46,960
<i>When he was my age, things
were different for Pop.</i>

381
00:41:46,961 --> 00:41:50,130
<i>By the time of the Great Depression,
my father, Vincenzo Cortino...</i>

382
00:41:50,131 --> 00:41:55,302
<i>was a law-abiding citizen struggling through
the ranks of the Manhattan olive oil business.</i>

383
00:41:55,303 --> 00:41:58,972
Vincenzo Cortino! Hey, Vincenzo.

384
00:41:58,973 --> 00:42:01,651
- Hey, Clamato, how are you?
- Look at you. You work too hard.

385
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,903
Come to the duck fights with me tonight.

386
00:42:03,904 --> 00:42:08,649
- The kid is undefeated.
- Eh, no, Dominick, thank you.

387
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:12,695
I have a family. I'm married.
I'm not supposed to enjoy myself.

388
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,990
Besides, where'd you get enough
money to buy your own duck, hmm?

389
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:18,285
When are you gonna wise up, Vincenzo?

390
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,787
Someday I'm gonna own an entire goose...

391
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,929
and you'll still have the
stink of olives on you.

392
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:29,296
- Who is he?
- <i>Don Narducci, the Black Hand.</i>

393
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:32,258
<i>For a price, he protects the people.</i>

394
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:36,610
Stay away from him, or your life won't
be worth the paper it's printed on.

395
00:42:49,685 --> 00:42:51,998
Yeah.

396
00:42:57,327 --> 00:43:01,168
- That's a good week's work, Vincenzo.
- <i>Papa! Papa!</i>

397
00:43:04,418 --> 00:43:08,880
Papa, Papa, good news! I sold
the other daisy to Signor Biggio.

398
00:43:08,881 --> 00:43:12,842
Ah, Tiny Anthony. Come. Come.

399
00:43:12,843 --> 00:43:15,387
Ah, you are such a good boy. You know that?

400
00:43:15,388 --> 00:43:19,016
- It's Joey's birthday, Papa.
- Yes, yes, I know.

401
00:43:19,017 --> 00:43:21,810
<i>We will try to find him
something nice on the way home.</i>

402
00:43:21,811 --> 00:43:26,281
Well, I guess you'll be needing your pay.

403
00:43:30,529 --> 00:43:33,448
<i>I give you the big half.</i>

404
00:43:33,949 --> 00:43:36,409
Grazie, Mr Rizzo. Grazie.

405
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:40,038
- <i>You are too good to me, huh?
- It's nothing.</i>

406
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:44,668
- Come. Let's go home.
- <i>You do well. Right, Tiny Anthony?</i>

407
00:43:44,669 --> 00:43:47,045
- I'll see you tomorrow, Signor Rizzo.
- <i>Si.</i>

408
00:43:47,046 --> 00:43:49,512
Goodbye, Mr Rizzo.

409
00:43:50,842 --> 00:43:53,688
<i>God bless us, every one!</i>

410
00:43:56,765 --> 00:43:59,396
<i>Mama, we're home!</i>

411
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,146
- Papa.
- Joey.

412
00:44:03,147 --> 00:44:07,066
- I sold another flower, Mama.
- That's wonderful.

413
00:44:07,067 --> 00:44:11,455
<i>Come. Sit. Dinner is ready. Sit,
sit. I've been cooking all day.</i>

414
00:44:18,421 --> 00:44:21,298
I had to sell the hook.

415
00:44:21,699 --> 00:44:23,685
Ah.

416
00:44:24,086 --> 00:44:29,340
I saw a man today, Rosa, who
sucks his own people dry.

417
00:44:29,341 --> 00:44:32,602
Mmm. Like in those movies you made me watch.

418
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:36,065
No. I mean, in a bad way.

419
00:44:36,066 --> 00:44:38,959
- Oh.
- What did you bring me for my birthday, Papa?

420
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,853
What did I bring you? This.

421
00:44:41,854 --> 00:44:44,549
<i>Happy birthday, Joey.</i>

422
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:48,619
- Mmm, boot! It smells delicious, Rosa.
- Mmm.

423
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,388
- <i>Who wants an end cut?
- Can I have the tongue?</i>

424
00:44:50,389 --> 00:44:53,163
<i>Open your present, Joey.</i>

425
00:44:58,872 --> 00:45:01,383
- Pop, it's a rat.
- <i>No.</i>

426
00:45:01,384 --> 00:45:05,178
- It's a puppy.
- But it looks like a rat.

427
00:45:05,179 --> 00:45:08,340
Don't argue with your father.
God'll pluck your eyes out.

428
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:10,853
It's a puppy.

429
00:45:13,137 --> 00:45:18,719
- Must have cost you a fortune.
- Yes. But look how happy the boy is.

430
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:33,450
Someday, will I be able to run and
play like all the other children?

431
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:36,536
Yes, my son. Yes.

432
00:45:36,537 --> 00:45:43,043
And I promise you, there will come a day
where your legs will be as strong as any ox...

433
00:45:43,044 --> 00:45:49,018
and this... this battered old crutch,
will be nothing but a memory.

434
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:57,029
So, the Cortino's are celebrating.

435
00:46:00,846 --> 00:46:03,690
I want my cut of the money
you've been making, Cortino.

436
00:46:03,691 --> 00:46:07,161
<i>Please, Don Narducci. We have nothing.</i>

437
00:46:07,162 --> 00:46:09,046
- <i>Papa! Papa!</i>
- What is it, Joey?

438
00:46:09,047 --> 00:46:12,625
We have the money in the green can we've
been saving for Anthony's operation.

439
00:46:12,626 --> 00:46:16,203
I'm not a greedy man. I
just want to wet my beak.

440
00:46:16,204 --> 00:46:18,302
- Please, no!
- Rosa.

441
00:46:20,584 --> 00:46:22,660
Next time you'd better have more...

442
00:46:22,661 --> 00:46:26,536
or I'll take something truly precious from you.

443
00:46:32,638 --> 00:46:35,696
God bless us, every one!

444
00:46:35,767 --> 00:46:42,982
- <i># Danke schoen Darlin', danke schoen #
- After I whacked Gorgoni, I had to disappear.</i>

445
00:46:42,983 --> 00:46:47,069
<i>When a guy on the run wants to hide,
there's no place like Las Vegas.</i>

446
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,798
<i>It's a city with no memory,</i>

447
00:46:48,799 --> 00:46:54,494
- <i>a town full of strangers.
- # I recall Central Park in fall #</i>

448
00:46:54,495 --> 00:46:58,807
<i># How you tore your dress what a mess #</i>

449
00:46:58,808 --> 00:47:02,203
- <i># I can... #
- They say you can't hit a moving target,</i>

450
00:47:02,204 --> 00:47:04,140
- <i>so I kept moving.
- # Danke schoen... #</i>

451
00:47:04,141 --> 00:47:09,635
- <i># Darlin', danke schoen #</i>
- Right now, watch, ladies and gentlemen...

452
00:47:09,636 --> 00:47:15,565
as I transform my lovely assistant
Louise into a Bengal tiger.

453
00:47:18,062 --> 00:47:22,857
<i>Pop never groomed me for a life
like this. He had other plans.</i>

454
00:47:22,858 --> 00:47:26,486
<i>I was supposed to be Senator
Cortino or Governor Cortino.</i>

455
00:47:26,487 --> 00:47:28,916
Louise! Tiger!

456
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:35,505
<i>Louise! What a pair of legs on her, huh?</i>

457
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:42,295
<i>After a while the long hours, the
pressure to perform, the catty reviews...</i>

458
00:47:42,296 --> 00:47:44,881
<i>it started to wear me down.</i>

459
00:47:44,882 --> 00:47:46,109
<i>Then one day out of the blue,</i>

460
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:51,346
- <i>I get a message from Don Marzoni.
- # The memory stays for always #</i>

461
00:47:51,347 --> 00:47:54,641
- <i># My heart says #
- This guy owns Vegas.</i>

462
00:47:54,642 --> 00:47:59,605
<i># Danke schoen Oh, darlin', danke schoen #</i>

463
00:47:59,606 --> 00:48:02,716
I don't know if I could run
your casino even if I wanted to.

464
00:48:02,717 --> 00:48:06,529
You might think of this job as
kind of an insurance policy.

465
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:10,783
I know that, but I killed a guy. I mean, I'm on
the lam. Nobody's gonna give me a casino licence.

466
00:48:10,784 --> 00:48:12,952
You don't have to have a
licence to work a casino.

467
00:48:12,953 --> 00:48:15,872
You just apply to the gaming commission.

468
00:48:15,873 --> 00:48:20,001
This commission's the same guys that run
Major League Baseball. Now, think about it.

469
00:48:20,002 --> 00:48:25,054
You think they're gonna turn you
down just for killing a guy? Nah.

470
00:48:26,909 --> 00:48:28,694
<i>Who could resist?</i>

471
00:48:29,095 --> 00:48:30,043
<i>Anywhere else in the country,</i>

472
00:48:30,044 --> 00:48:32,339
- <i>I'd be just another murderer.
- Place your bets! Place your bets!</i>

473
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:33,908
- <i>The best things in life are free
- New shooter comin' in!</i>

474
00:48:33,909 --> 00:48:37,019
- <i>But here I was a murderer who ran a casino.</i>
- Big time! Let's go! Big time!

475
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:37,771
Big time!

476
00:48:37,772 --> 00:48:41,232
- <i>Suddenly I fit right in.</i>
- New shooter!

477
00:48:41,233 --> 00:48:44,125
<i>Craps! Loser!</i>

478
00:48:47,907 --> 00:48:51,827
<i>Marzoni brought out my brother Joey to
handle security, and we went to work.</i>

479
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:53,954
Oh, look who's here. It's Joey.

480
00:48:53,955 --> 00:48:57,457
- <i># Money don't get everything, it's true #</i>
- Oh, my God!

481
00:48:57,458 --> 00:48:59,960
- <i># But what it don't get I can't use #
- I'm sorry. You lose.</i>

482
00:48:59,961 --> 00:49:01,513
Nope, I'm sorry. Thank you for playing.

483
00:49:01,514 --> 00:49:05,216
<i>The way I figured it, the best way to stay
alive was to make money for the family.</i>

484
00:49:05,217 --> 00:49:07,001
We love it. Thank you for playing.

485
00:49:07,002 --> 00:49:13,433
<i>So I made money, enough to make a
Wall Street investment banker drool.</i>

486
00:49:13,434 --> 00:49:17,020
- Place your bets. Place your bets.
- <i>All I thought about was the casino.</i>

487
00:49:17,021 --> 00:49:20,732
- Fifty-two pick-up.
- <i>No distractions, no time for myself.</i>

488
00:49:20,733 --> 00:49:25,571
- <i>Until...
- Yeah! Come on, baby! Yeah!</i>

489
00:49:25,572 --> 00:49:28,796
Yeah! All right, baby! Yeah!

490
00:49:32,704 --> 00:49:37,250
<i># Sittin' here Eatin' my heart out, waitin' #</i>

491
00:49:37,251 --> 00:49:39,460
<i># Waitin' for some lover to call #</i>

492
00:49:39,461 --> 00:49:44,674
- <i># Lookin' for some hot stuff,baby this evenin' #

00:49:44,675 --> 00:49:48,020
- <i># I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight #

494
00:49:48,221 --> 00:49:52,391

495
00:49:52,392 --> 00:49:54,485

496
00:49:54,486 --> 00:49:57,229
<i># Got to have your love tonight #</i>

497
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:00,149
- Ohh! Oooh!
- Yeah!

498
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:04,529
- <i># I need hot stuff #</i>
- Yeah! Yes!

499
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:07,198
<i># Hot stuff #</i>

500
00:50:07,399 --> 00:50:11,711
<i>She had everything a man could want...</i>

501
00:50:11,712 --> 00:50:15,457
<i>beauty, brains...</i>

502
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:17,575
<i>and class.</i>

503
00:50:17,576 --> 00:50:20,090
Yeah, yeah! Yeah!

504
00:50:28,638 --> 00:50:32,391
- <i># Lookin' for a lover who needs another #</i>
- Come here, baby!

505
00:50:32,392 --> 00:50:36,029
<i># Don't want another night on my own #</i>

506
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:40,567
<i>What a dismount. I fell in love right there.</i>

507
00:50:40,568 --> 00:50:44,219
- <i># Wanna bring a wild man back home #</i>
- Where'd you learn to dance like that?

508
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,806
Juilliard.

509
00:50:45,807 --> 00:50:50,377
I wanted to be a research chemist,
but my legs were too long.

510
00:50:50,378 --> 00:50:53,622
You know, there's something
very familiar about you.

511
00:50:53,623 --> 00:50:56,751
We met at your father's attempted murder.

512
00:50:56,752 --> 00:50:59,295
Oh, that's right. You're Pepper Giannini, right?

513
00:50:59,296 --> 00:51:02,423
- You were with Don Marzoni.
- He's such a sweetheart.

514
00:51:02,424 --> 00:51:04,968
He helped me out once when
I was down on my luck.

515
00:51:04,969 --> 00:51:08,638
- Financial trouble?
- No. Mai Luck, the Chinese ambassador.

516
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:11,484
Oh, hi!

517
00:51:14,354 --> 00:51:19,400
So, the Peppermill. Marzoni
named it after you, huh?

518
00:51:19,401 --> 00:51:22,826
<i>Sure did. I'm the apple of his eye.</i>

519
00:51:24,197 --> 00:51:26,532
I'll bet you're rotten to the core.

520
00:51:26,533 --> 00:51:29,923
Yeah. And I'm delicious.

521
00:51:45,094 --> 00:51:48,105
<i>Diane was becoming a distant memory...</i>

522
00:51:53,103 --> 00:51:55,366
<i>very distant.</i>

523
00:52:00,035 --> 00:52:02,582
<i>I had a feeling she was a wildcat...</i>

524
00:52:04,573 --> 00:52:07,765
<i>but I knew I was just the
man who could tame her.</i>

525
00:52:35,439 --> 00:52:38,913
Ow!

526
00:52:49,579 --> 00:52:53,385
Anthony? Anthony?

527
00:52:59,757 --> 00:53:01,854
Huh?

528
00:53:02,843 --> 00:53:05,023
Oh!

529
00:53:09,934 --> 00:53:12,067
Wow! Oh!

530
00:53:13,813 --> 00:53:17,370
Oh, yes! Anthony! Oh!

531
00:53:21,989 --> 00:53:25,074
Yes! Yes! Yes!

532
00:53:25,075 --> 00:53:27,535
Oh, Anthony!

533
00:53:27,536 --> 00:53:30,214
Wheee!

534
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,860
Wow. You got game.

535
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:40,722
<i>All bets are down. The lady's comin' out.</i>

536
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,606
- Yeah!
- <i>This lady's a winner.</i>

537
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:50,927
<i>Pepper started taking up a lot of my time...</i>

538
00:53:50,928 --> 00:53:53,688
<i>but I tried to stay focused on the casino.</i>

539
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:57,364
<i>Box cars. Come on.</i> Yeah!

540
00:53:59,529 --> 00:54:01,626
<i>Joey wasn't much help.</i>

541
00:54:08,571 --> 00:54:11,153
- You're winnin' my money?
- Yeah!

542
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:13,968
<i>Looking back, I was so blinded by love...</i>

543
00:54:13,969 --> 00:54:17,512
<i>I didn't see the big problem
right in front of me.</i>

544
00:54:28,518 --> 00:54:33,230
<i># Looking for love #</i>

545
00:54:33,231 --> 00:54:36,855
<i>If it was white and if it was
powder, Joey was into it.</i>

546
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:41,581
<i>It was my job to keep an eye on the gamblers...</i>

547
00:54:43,241 --> 00:54:45,451
<i>but my eyes were only on Pepper.</i>

548
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:48,023
- Fourteen, sixteen, bust.
- <i>When I stopped paying attention</i>

549
00:54:48,024 --> 00:54:49,080
<i>so did everyone else...</i>

550
00:54:49,081 --> 00:54:53,918
- <i>House pays.
- and the suckers started beating the house.</i>

551
00:54:53,919 --> 00:54:57,380
<i>Then the cheaters got wind
and started flocking to us.</i>

552
00:54:57,381 --> 00:54:59,968
<i>They cruise from casino to
casino looking for weak dealers...</i>

553
00:54:59,969 --> 00:55:02,896
<i>...the way lions look for weak antelope.</i>

554
00:55:06,182 --> 00:55:08,280
Queen.

555
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:15,066
<i>I could see the dealer wasn't in on it but
he was lifting his hole card way too high.</i>

556
00:55:15,067 --> 00:55:17,694
Yeah.

557
00:55:17,695 --> 00:55:21,204
<i>We had a surefire way of
handling things like that.</i>

558
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:27,563
<i>Now here's this guy reading the
hole card and signalling his buddy.</i>

559
00:55:27,564 --> 00:55:30,290
- Bet the farm!
- <i># Let me tell you now #</i>

- <i># I never thought it would be this way #</i>

574
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,354
<i>Joey was always a hothead,</i>

575
00:56:21,355 --> 00:56:22,721
- <i>but I could rely on him.</i>
- Who?

576
00:56:22,722 --> 00:56:25,807
- No, no, no!             - <i># Oh #

<i>Now with the drugs, he was out of control,</i>

578
00:56:27,737 --> 00:56:30,079
- <i>and the place was falling apart.</i>
- Get out of the way.

579
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:34,285
<i>Then the take dropped off, and that's the
worst thing that can happen at a casino.</i>

580
00:56:36,036 --> 00:56:39,164
<i>I did what I could to turn things around...</i>

581
00:56:39,165 --> 00:56:43,201
<i>we recycled the food, fired the dishwashers...</i>

582
00:56:43,202 --> 00:56:47,414
<i>started a happy hour for

<i>We even watered down the drinks...</i>

584

<i># Happy birthday to you #</i>

586

00:57:27,866 --> 00:57:32,095
I'm especially pleased to have representatives
from the five families with us...

595
00:57:32,096 --> 00:57:34,839
<i>the Badalotos, the Romanis...</i>

596
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,800
<i>the Marzonis, the Jeffersons...</i>

597
00:57:37,801 --> 00:57:42,097
<i>who moved on up from the East Side
to get themselves a piece of the pie.</i>

598
00:57:42,098 --> 00:57:47,069
My friends, a while ago I was shot 47 times.

599
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:52,140
And it really got me thinking:
It's time to pass on my power.

600
00:57:52,141 --> 00:57:57,905
<i>And I want you all to know that at the
time of my death, I, Don Cortizone...</i>

601
00:57:57,906 --> 00:58:02,151
will turn over all that I
control to my son, Anthony.

602
00:58:02,152 --> 00:58:04,129
- <i>Congratulations!
- Congratulations!</i>

603
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:06,706
- <i>Good boy, Anthony.
- Just great!</i>

604
00:58:06,707 --> 00:58:08,867
<i>Anthony.</i>

605
00:58:09,168 --> 00:58:11,765
Joey, you get Wisconsin.

606
00:58:13,164 --> 00:58:15,595
<i>Ah, devil's food.</i>

607
00:58:15,596 --> 00:58:18,178
<i>Banjie, Enjoy!</i>

608
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:27,369
- Pastiori!
- Quick-pick loser!

609
00:58:32,026 --> 00:58:35,929
Wisconsin... big, fat German women.

610
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:38,427
It ain't right.

611
00:58:40,868 --> 00:58:44,938
If you ask me, your being
passed over's an insult.

612
00:58:44,939 --> 00:58:49,543
I'm smart. I can handle anything.

613
00:58:49,544 --> 00:58:54,448
- I been groomin' myself my whole life to be Don.
- Maybe I can help.

614
00:58:56,018 --> 00:58:58,144
It's none of your business, all right?

615
00:58:58,145 --> 00:59:01,557
Don't ever try to come
between me and my family.

616
00:59:02,149 --> 00:59:09,184
Ooh. Anger. Maybe I've been
barking up the wrong Cortino.

617
00:59:24,414 --> 00:59:28,251
<i>That a girl. Come get the bone.</i>

618
00:59:28,252 --> 00:59:32,172
<i>You wanna go to the park?
All right, now roll over.</i>

619
00:59:32,173 --> 00:59:34,967
<i>There you go. Speak!</i>

620
00:59:37,428 --> 00:59:41,265
- Oh, my God. How could you?
- What are ya talkin' about?

621
00:59:41,266 --> 00:59:44,977
A total stranger I could understand.
You and another woman, maybe.

622
00:59:44,978 --> 00:59:48,939
Me, you and another woman,
definitely. But Joey, my brother!

623
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:51,943
Tony, it... it's not what it looks like.

624
00:59:51,944 --> 00:59:54,529
It's the Heimlich. She
swallowed a big chunk of meat.

625
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:58,283
- You're banging your brains out.
- You're just guessing!

626
00:59:58,284 --> 01:00:00,168
What do you take me for, some kind of an idiot?

627
01:00:00,169 --> 01:00:04,539
Tony, ti amo. The air conditioning broke.

628
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:06,509
We had to cool down.

629
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:10,841
- How can you deny this?
- You can't prove anything.

630
01:00:13,124 --> 01:00:16,894
- You're a slut. You will sleep with anybody.
- <i>That's what sluts do.</i>

631
01:00:16,895 --> 01:00:19,430
If I was particular, I wouldn't be a slut.

632
01:00:19,431 --> 01:00:22,609
Joey, you're the last person in
the world I'd expect this from.

633
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:26,062
- We're family. I would never betray you.
- <i>Don't lie to me!</i>

634
01:00:26,063 --> 01:00:30,984
- You guys are sleeping together!
- <i>All right, all right!</i> But we never actually slept!

635
01:00:30,985 --> 01:00:33,188
<i>Oh, my God, that's my brother!</i>

636
01:00:33,189 --> 01:00:37,660
- Don't you ever go near him again!
- You don't own me, Anthony.

637
01:00:39,452 --> 01:00:43,937
- That's why we don't have nice things, Pepper.
- Get out! Get out of my life!

638
01:00:57,814 --> 01:01:00,599
- <i>Tony, it... it's not what it looks like.
- Psychopath, right?</i>

639
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,518
<i>I can't turn my back on Pop and
Joey. They're like family to me.</i>

640
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:06,989
- <i>This is that whole Sicilian thing, isn't it?
- I would never betray you.</i>

641
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:10,484
- <i>I always knew I could count on you.
- They're criminals. They're murderers.</i>

642
01:01:10,485 --> 01:01:13,237
- <i>Criminals are people too, Diane.
- Get out of my life!</i>

643
01:01:13,238 --> 01:01:17,658
<i>I did not have sexual
relations with that woman...</i>

644
01:01:17,659 --> 01:01:22,404
<i>Miss Lewinsky... but I am wearing her underwear.</i>

645
01:01:32,684 --> 01:01:34,681
It's done.

646
01:01:44,955 --> 01:01:47,071
Chuckie?

647
01:01:51,403 --> 01:01:53,951
Watch this.

648
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,846
Boogey, boogey, boogey!

649
01:02:10,048 --> 01:02:13,106
Boogey, boogey, boogey!

650
01:02:15,888 --> 01:02:18,473
That stinks, Chuckie.

651
01:02:18,974 --> 01:02:21,072
I started this.

652
01:02:34,199 --> 01:02:36,912
Grandpa? Grandpa?

653
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:42,428
Rolex!

654
01:02:54,437 --> 01:03:00,662
<i>Everybody dies, but in the Mafia, people
die more often, and never by accident.</i>

655
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:05,356
<i>The death of my father sent shock
waves through the underworld.</i>

656
01:03:05,357 --> 01:03:08,918
<i>The family was without a leader.</i>

657
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:13,740
<i>The news reached me at a private hospital
that catered exclusively to English patients.</i>

658
01:03:13,741 --> 01:03:16,910
One, two, three...

659
01:03:16,911 --> 01:03:21,256
<i>My explosion, his death...
someone wanted the Cortino empire.</i>

<i>"Dwell in the Lord's house...</i>

682

<i>But it wasn't until I saw
Chuckie, my brother Joey's kid...</i>

683

<i>And now, with my own
nephew, he had succeeded.</i>

01:04:56,475 --> 01:05:01,479
<i>In the quicksand of organized crime,

"My cup runneth..."

689

<i>I wondered how Pop would
have handled all of this.</i>

690
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:22,171
<i>Then I thought back...</i>

691
01:05:22,172 --> 01:05:25,546
- <i>to the most important day of my childhood.
- Daisies, daisies!</i>

692
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:28,543
Five dozen for a nickel!

693
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:33,729
Daisies, daisies! Five dozen for a nickel!

694
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:39,686
- Hi, Tiny Anthony. How's my favourite florist?
- Oh, hi, Jenny. This is for you.

695
01:05:39,687 --> 01:05:41,572
Thank you.

696
01:05:41,573 --> 01:05:47,287
Ah, the Cortino boy. You know, your
papa never paid me what he owes.

697
01:05:52,793 --> 01:05:56,769
You've done well. This belongs to me.

698
01:05:58,081 --> 01:06:03,300
Of course, Don Narducci. And so does this!

699
01:06:04,505 --> 01:06:07,132
- Miracle Gro!
- You okay, boss? You okay?

700
01:06:07,133 --> 01:06:08,744
- <i>Hey, kid!
- Come on. Let's go after him.</i>

701
01:06:08,745 --> 01:06:11,350
- Get him!
- <i>Hey, you! Come here!</i>

702
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:33,760
Run, florist, run!

703
01:06:44,848 --> 01:06:47,342
Get back here, kid!

704
01:06:51,596 --> 01:06:54,970
Ooh! Pitchfork! Look out!

705
01:07:01,991 --> 01:07:05,068
Papa! Papa!

706
01:07:05,069 --> 01:07:07,979
Tiny Anthony, my boy!

707
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:10,127
It's a miracle!

708
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:15,759
Stay.

709
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:22,495
You surprise me, Don Narducci. They say
violence is the hand puppet of the ignorant.

710
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:26,661
- Don't call me ignorant.
- No? Then answer me this:

711
01:07:26,662 --> 01:07:30,929
Train "A" leaves Seattle at 40 miles per hour.

712
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:34,233
Train "B" leaves Houston at 50 miles per hour.

713
01:07:34,234 --> 01:07:37,102
Which train arrives at Sea World first?

714
01:07:37,103 --> 01:07:38,536
- Papa! Papa!
- And carry the six.

715
01:07:38,537 --> 01:07:39,855
<i>What is it, Joey?</i>

716
01:07:39,856 --> 01:07:44,568
This is 1938. There won't be
Sea World for another 30 years.

717
01:07:44,569 --> 01:07:49,107
You tried to trick me. Now I kill you all.

718
01:07:54,788 --> 01:07:57,020
He's mine!

719
01:08:25,746 --> 01:08:28,245
Don Cortino!

720
01:08:29,442 --> 01:08:31,502
Godfather.

721
01:08:31,503 --> 01:08:34,204
<i>Papa taught me the virtue of vengeance.</i>

722
01:08:34,205 --> 01:08:37,274
<i>Now was time to take control
of the family business.</i>

723
01:08:37,275 --> 01:08:41,304
<i>But first I had to put my life back on
track, and that meant finding Diane.</i>

724
01:08:41,305 --> 01:08:45,475
<i>And although it seemed an impossible
dream just a few years ago...</i>

725
01:08:45,476 --> 01:08:49,979
<i>the feeling here today fluctuates
between anxious anticipation...</i>

726
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:54,025
<i>and outright exhilaration as
political and spiritual leaders...</i>

727
01:08:54,026 --> 01:08:58,480
<i>from every country on Earth have
convened at this historic site...</i>

728
01:08:58,481 --> 01:09:01,191
<i>to witness the final
signature on the document...</i>

729

<i>that will secure and guarantee
world peace in perpetuity.</i>

730
01:09:05,947 --> 01:09:08,833
<i>The "Peace For All Time" treaty... or P-FAT...</i>

731
01:09:08,834 --> 01:09:13,871
<i>as it has been dubbed by its author and
champion, the President of the United States...</i>

732
01:09:13,872 --> 01:09:18,376
<i>marks the culmination of one
valiant person's heroic crusade...</i>

733
01:09:18,377 --> 01:09:22,339
to end strife, no matter where it may occur.

734
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:24,783
<i>The presidential limousine is arriving.</i>

735
01:09:24,784 --> 01:09:29,188
<i>The president is emerging and
striding triumphantly forward.</i>

736
01:09:29,189 --> 01:09:33,550
<i>One can only imagine the thoughts that
must be racing through her mind...</i>

737
01:09:33,551 --> 01:09:38,105
<i>as the world's attention focuses
on this unprecedented achievement.</i>

738
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:44,412
With the addition of my signature today...

739
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:47,161
P-FAT becomes a reality.

740
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:54,331
It is my most fervent hope that this be the
moment when all mankind comes together...

741
01:09:54,332 --> 01:09:59,300
when at last the world's population
can rise as one, and say...

742
01:10:00,839 --> 01:10:03,525
Anthony?

743
01:10:04,426 --> 01:10:06,635
- Oh, my God!
- <i>Step back.</i>

744
01:10:06,636 --> 01:10:08,822
- <i>Stand closely. Take the left.
- I got it.</i>

745
01:10:08,823 --> 01:10:11,134
Anthony.

746
01:10:12,677 --> 01:10:14,108
It's good to see you, Diane.

747
01:10:15,729 --> 01:10:21,401
- What happened to your face?
- Car exploded.

748
01:10:21,402 --> 01:10:27,616
- What are you doing here, Anthony?
- I've taken over the family business. I need you.

749
01:10:27,617 --> 01:10:31,078
I care about you. I came here because I want
you to marry me and come home with me.

750
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:33,456
Madam President, the treaty.

751
01:10:33,457 --> 01:10:35,666
<i>Madam President?</i>

752
01:10:35,667 --> 01:10:38,152
But what about P-FAT, Anthony?

753
01:10:38,153 --> 01:10:43,023
I'm so near to fulfilling the
dream that... that we once shared.

754
01:10:48,481 --> 01:10:50,774
There's someone I want you to meet.

755
01:10:50,775 --> 01:10:53,185
<i>This is my very good friend, President Steen.</i>

756
01:10:53,186 --> 01:10:56,897
- <i>Would you like to say hi to her?</i>
- Hi, President Steen.

757
01:10:56,898 --> 01:11:01,193
Hello. You're a daddy.

758
01:11:01,194 --> 01:11:03,541
I'm a daddy.

759
01:11:04,815 --> 01:11:09,269
- So, what's your name?
- Diane.

760
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:14,494
- Like me!
- <i>I named him after his mother.</i>

761
01:11:19,505 --> 01:11:21,849
I'm a mother?

762
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:26,261
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You said you didn't want to be a part of my life.

763
01:11:26,262 --> 01:11:28,347
Oh!

764
01:11:28,348 --> 01:11:31,743
Anthony, he's the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen!

765
01:11:31,744 --> 01:11:34,656
He looks just like me!

766
01:11:35,439 --> 01:11:38,617
You smell good.

767
01:11:39,118 --> 01:11:42,370
I had cantaloupe for lunch.

768
01:11:42,371 --> 01:11:44,990
- You like football, huh?
- Uh-huh.

769
01:11:44,991 --> 01:11:48,660
Ever since Michael lrvin
laid off the nose candy.

770
01:11:48,661 --> 01:11:51,463
<i>Do you want to play?</i>

771
01:11:51,464 --> 01:11:55,621
- I'd love to.
- Are you my real mommy?

772
01:12:00,557 --> 01:12:02,986
Uh-huh.

773
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:07,156
Go long, Mommy.

774
01:12:46,139 --> 01:12:47,988
<i>Yeah, I understand, but...</i>

775
01:12:48,066 --> 01:12:51,235
I...I don't know if I can make it there.

776
01:12:51,236 --> 01:12:53,604
You sure?

777
01:12:53,605 --> 01:12:55,725
You're out of the wedding, Joey.

778
01:12:57,526 --> 01:13:01,684
- It's a local call.
- You gotta answer for Pop.

779
01:13:03,032 --> 01:13:06,601
What the hell you talkin' about?
I had nothin' to do with that.

780
01:13:06,602 --> 01:13:10,964
You fingered him. Just like you
set me up that day in Vegas...

781
01:13:10,965 --> 01:13:13,458
that little sexual fromage-a-trois
you played with Pepper.

782
01:13:13,459 --> 01:13:15,928
You think you can fool another Cortino?

783
01:13:15,929 --> 01:13:19,140
You bastarducci!

784
01:13:19,141 --> 01:13:21,950
Sit down.

785
01:13:24,605 --> 01:13:27,148
Get him a drink.

786
01:13:27,149 --> 01:13:30,151
Tony, don't do this to me, please.

787
01:13:30,152 --> 01:13:34,114
<i>You think I'd kill my own brother
just 'cause he tried to kill me?</i>

788
01:13:34,115 --> 01:13:36,908
<i>Today's the day I settle all family business.</i>

789
01:13:36,909 --> 01:13:41,101
- <i>I'm putting you on a plane to Fargo.</i>
- These are over the wing!

790
01:13:42,248 --> 01:13:45,758
<i>Now, tell me everything
that happened that night.</i>

791
01:13:47,546 --> 01:13:50,724
And don't lie to me, because
it insults my intelligence.

792
01:13:51,925 --> 01:13:54,761
Pepper got me together with Marzoni.

793
01:13:54,762 --> 01:13:59,641
<i>He said if I helped him out,
he'd make it worth my while.</i>

794
01:13:59,642 --> 01:14:03,136
- He said he'd make me head of the family.
- You know I'd always take care of you.

795
01:14:03,137 --> 01:14:08,942
You're my kid brother! You take care of me?
I'm the oldest, Tony, and I was stepped over!

796
01:14:08,943 --> 01:14:10,937
- That was Pop's idea.
- Well, it wasn't my idea.

797
01:14:10,938 --> 01:14:12,655
You're a psychotic lunatic!

798
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:15,302
And I deserve respect for that!

799
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:19,912
You broke my heart, Joey.

800
01:14:19,913 --> 01:14:22,723
I don't ever want to see you again.

801
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:34,691
That's, uh, $3.50.

802
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:13,302
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here in the sight of God...

803
01:15:13,303 --> 01:15:18,055
to join this man and this woman
in the state of holy matrimony.

804
01:15:19,685 --> 01:15:22,762
<i>It is the most sacred of journeys...</i>

805
01:15:22,763 --> 01:15:25,232
<i>one in which the sanctity of human life...</i>

806
01:15:25,233 --> 01:15:28,160
<i>is cherished and celebrated.</i>

807
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:31,989
<i>Your love must be sincere.</i>

808
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:36,201
<i>Detest what is evil, cling to what is good...</i>

809
01:15:36,202 --> 01:15:39,997
<i>rejoice in hope, be patient under trial...</i>

810
01:15:39,998 --> 01:15:45,753
<i>persevere in prayer, be generous
in offering hospitality.</i>

811
01:15:45,754 --> 01:15:48,339
<i>Clothe yourselves with heartfelt mercy...</i>

812
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:52,525
<i>with kindness, with humility,
meekness and patience.</i>

813
01:15:53,596 --> 01:15:58,445
<i>Bear with one another. Forgive whatever
grievances you have against one another.</i>

814
01:15:59,686 --> 01:16:03,105
<i>My dear friends, you have come
together in this church...</i>

815
01:16:03,106 --> 01:16:05,900
<i>so that the Lord may seal
and strengthen your love...</i>

816
01:16:05,901 --> 01:16:09,904
<i>in the presence of this
church's minister and community.</i>

817
01:16:09,905 --> 01:16:14,742
<i>And so in the presence of the Church,
I ask you to state your intentions.</i>

818
01:16:14,743 --> 01:16:18,621
Anthony and Diane, have you come here
freely and without reservation...

819
01:16:18,622 --> 01:16:21,041
<i>to give yourselves to each other in marriage?</i>

820
01:16:21,042 --> 01:16:23,585
- We have.
- We have.

821
01:16:23,586 --> 01:16:29,133
<i>Will you love and honour each other as
man and wife for the rest of your life?</i>

822
01:16:29,134 --> 01:16:31,844
<i>We will.</i>

823
01:16:31,845 --> 01:16:34,523
Let us pray.

824
01:16:55,203 --> 01:16:57,300
Huh?

825
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:20,979
<i>Anthony and Diane, since it is your
intention to enter into marriage...</i>

826
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:25,565
<i>join your right hands and declare your consent.</i>

827
01:17:27,404 --> 01:17:30,865
<i>Diane, do you take Anthony
for your lawful husband...</i>

828
01:17:30,866 --> 01:17:33,409
<i>to have and to hold from this day forward...</i>

829
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:37,263
<i>for better, for worse, for richer, for
poorer, in sickness and in health...</i>

830
01:17:37,264 --> 01:17:39,415
<i>till death do you part?</i>

831
01:17:39,416 --> 01:17:41,292
<i>I do.</i>

832
01:17:41,293 --> 01:17:44,671
<i>Anthony, do you take Diane to
be your lawfully wedded wife...</i>

833
01:17:44,672 --> 01:17:49,051
<i>to have and to hold from this day
forward, for better, for worse...</i>

834
01:17:49,052 --> 01:17:53,956
<i>for richer, for poorer, in sickness
and in health, till death do you part?</i>

835
01:17:53,957 --> 01:17:56,005
I do.

836
01:18:01,773 --> 01:18:05,863
<i>Ow! Yikes! Hey!</i>

837
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:10,357
<i>That's my liver, you dick!</i>

838
01:18:34,558 --> 01:18:37,070
<i>Watch me. Watch me.</i>

839
01:18:48,448 --> 01:18:52,451
- <i>What God hath joined together...</i>
- Not personal. Is business.

840
01:18:52,452 --> 01:18:55,795
<i>Let no man tear asunder.</i>

841
01:19:00,127 --> 01:19:03,288
Mazel Tov!

842
01:19:39,252 --> 01:19:43,275
- That's far enough, guys. Mafia only.
- Oh. Sorry.

843
01:19:45,425 --> 01:19:48,636
Lousy, cold-hearted bastard!

844
01:19:48,637 --> 01:19:52,306
You knew you were gonna kill them,
didn't you? Look at the papers!

845
01:19:52,307 --> 01:19:55,816
<i>That's you! That's my husband!</i>

846
01:19:57,187 --> 01:19:58,731
Is it true?

847
01:20:00,322 --> 01:20:02,275
Don't ask me about my business, Diane.

848
01:20:02,276 --> 01:20:07,493
Is it true, Anthony? Did you kill
those men? Did you kill Joey's son?

849
01:20:15,206 --> 01:20:17,208
No.

850
01:20:17,209 --> 01:20:22,310
Oh. Okay. Whoops.

851
01:20:22,923 --> 01:20:26,217
You know what? Think I'm gonna
go get some frozen yogurt.

852
01:20:26,218 --> 01:20:29,276
See you a little bit later.

853
01:20:30,589 --> 01:20:32,590
<i>So, here's the enigma:</i>

854
01:20:32,591 --> 01:20:35,268
<i>Some would argue that the Mafia's a bad thing...</i>

855
01:20:35,269 --> 01:20:38,330
<i>that it uses its power to
undermine law and order...</i>

856
01:20:38,331 --> 01:20:40,877
<i>to promote the very lowest
forms of human behaviour.</i>

857
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:42,684
Don Cortino.

858
01:20:42,685 --> 01:20:45,905
<i>Of course, that's all true, but
in the end, maybe it's worth it.</i>

859
01:20:45,906 --> 01:20:50,034
<i>The way I see it, when the law
fails us, it fails our children.</i>

860
01:20:50,035 --> 01:20:51,751
- Godfather.
- <i>Only the Mafia has the power...</i>

861
01:20:51,752 --> 01:20:53,413
<i>to do the one deed...</i>

862
01:20:53,414 --> 01:20:55,511
<i>to benefit all mankind.</i>

863
