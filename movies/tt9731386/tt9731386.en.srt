00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:29,125
My dad was in the military,
so we moved every two or three years.

330
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,750
That must have been difficult.

331
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,791
You sort of get used to it, I guess.

332
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,416
And you weren't tempted
by the military life yourself?

333
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,791
No, God no.

334
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,458
No, at the end of the day,

335
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,541
put on a uniform,
you gotta be prepared to…

336
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,666
Pull the trigger and end someone's life.

337
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,541
- I just don't think I could do that.
- Really?

338
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,166
- Yeah.
- [both chuckle]

339
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,208
So you sell cars instead?

340
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,291
I sell luxury cars.

341
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:04,416
- Right. There's a difference, is there?
- Oh, a huge difference.

342
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,375
[laughs]

343
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:09,166
If someone wants a luxury car,
they're looking for an idea of themselves.

344
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,458
- They're searching for a dream.
- Hmm.

345
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,166
If you think about it,
it's actually quite moving.

346
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:18,666
[chuckles]

347
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,916
Well, I've met plenty
of barroom philosophers,

348
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,625
but you're the first showroom philosopher.

349
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,250
[laughs]

350
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,583
What about you? Do you like what you do?

351
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,041
Mmm… [chuckles]

352
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,500
Um… "Like…"

353
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,541
Is a pretty strong word.

354
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:41,958
So why do you do it?

355
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,416
[laughs] Well, uh…

356
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:47,458
I mean…

357
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:53,583
It's… it's my job, you know?

358
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:02,375
[Alice sighs]

359
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:05,625
Well, thank you for dinner.
That was really… really lovely.

360
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,208
Oh... Yeah, yeah, well…

361
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,541
- Uh…
- And sorry again about last night.

362
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,875
No, it's... it's fine, honestly.

363
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,541
Uh… uh…

364
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:15,833
Oh. Um…

365
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,583
Uh, I hope your dad recovers quickly.

366
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:20,958
Yeah. Thank you.

367
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:23,916
- [clock chiming]
- Um…

368
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:30,375
Oh, yeah. [chuckles]

369
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,708
Take care, Alice.

370
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,125
What the fuck?

371
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:51,416
[phone ringing]

[door opens]

374
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:57,000
The file on the latest
Jeremy Ascott litigation.

[mouths]

377
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:10,333
Hello.

378
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,541
[Robert] <i>What are you doing now?</i>

379
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:13,750
What, <i>now</i> now?

380
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:15,833
I'm working. [laughs]

381
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:17,625
<i>I'd like to show you something.</i>

382
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,083
- What?
<i>- It's a surprise.</i>

383
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,625
- [Alice] Where are we going?
- [Robert] Be patient.

384
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:27,875
- [Alice] Is this it?
- [Robert] So full of questions. Trust me!

385
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,166
- Two, please.
- All right. Ten pounds.

386
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:33,642
- Thank you.
- What is this?

387
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,083
- Thank you.
- Come on.

388
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,208
Come on.

389
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:40,166
- Uh...
- Oh.

390
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,416
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

391
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:47,583
[resonant chiming]

392
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:53,666
[Alice] What is it?

393
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,708
[Robert] It's called <i>Long player.</i>

394
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,708
These are Tibetan music bowls.

395
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,125
They're playing a composition
that lasts for 1,000 years

396
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:05,000
without ever repeating itself.

397
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:08,375
It's controlled by a computer,

398
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,375
and it never, ever stops.

399
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:14,083
The plan is…

400
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:18,791
To just let it keep playing
without stopping.

401
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:22,750
Maybe, hopefully, for a thousand years.

402
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,791
You are…

403
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,375
So fucking random. [laughs]

404
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:33,041
Do you not like it?

405
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,166
I do like it.

406
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:40,083
I've never seen anything like it.

407
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:46,166
[laughs]

408
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,250
[chuckles]

409
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:51,500
Listen to that.

410
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,250
[Alice laughs]

411
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:55,666
Hey, come with me.

412
00:25:56,791 --> 00:25:58,208
Okay. [laughs]

413
00:25:58,291 --> 00:25:59,791
- Seriously, come on.
- All right.

414
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:07,166
I love lighthouses.

415
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,250
[gulls calling]

416
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,583

[distant alarm bell ringing]

418
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:19,208
[laughs] Wow.

419
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,583
- [Robert] Yeah.
- [gasps]

420
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:27,000
This lighthouse was here
way before any of those skyscrapers were,

421
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:31,000
and it'll probably be here
long after they're gone.

422
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,750
You think so?

423
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,000
Yeah. I hope so.

424
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:55,166

431
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:00,208
[Robert] Okay.

432
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:03,750
Right, I'm really sorry. I gotta go.

433

- [sighs]
- [phone vibrating]

434
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:10,416
Uh, it's my dad.

435
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:12,791
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

436
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:14,250
- Great.
- Great.

437
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
[Robert] Oh!

438
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:20,958
[running downstairs]

439
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:27,291
[man] Just a standard check?

440
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,708
Credit histories, mortgages,

441
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,166
and spouses?

442
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:35,791
- Thank you.
- I'll be in touch.

How's it going?

449
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:02,416
Oh, well, um…

450
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:06,291
I have the guest logs
for the last two weeks.

451
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,000
I can't find a pattern.

452
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:20,666
Nothing's standing out to me.

453
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:25,875
I'll get the analysts to take a look.

454
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:31,041
Well done.

455
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:36,750
Oh. I got you some, uh… some proper grub.

456
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:39,833
Spaghetti

457
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:42,375
and…

458
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:44,416
Bolognese.

459
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:48,291
Thank you.

460
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:51,500
No credit history at all?

461
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,541
[man] <i>Nothing.</i>
<i>And no marriage certificate.</i>

Robert Hansen is a ghost.</i>

And what does that tell you?

00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:02,833
<i>Nothing good.</i>

465
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:06,875
Okay. Thank you.

Great.

How was work? I didn't see you
when I passed this morning.

00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,166
Thank you.

Thanks.

Um…

473
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:27,333
Work… Uh, yeah,
I guess I was on a... on a test drive.

- Sell many cars?
- Two.

00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,583
Not a bad day at the office.

476
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,500
How about you?

477
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:41,375
The usual.

478
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,291
How's your dad?

479
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:57,083
He's better, thank you. Yeah.

480
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:00,333
He, um… he came home, which is great.
Such a relief.

481
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:02,625
Yeah.

[chuckles]

483
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:15,458
Everything all right?

484
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:18,625
Everything's great.

485
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:24,541
Give me a chip.

- One. No more.

You're not sure about me.

00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:43,583
What?

490
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:46,250
You have reservations.

491
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,500
Questions.

492
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:52,375
I had you checked out.

493
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:54,958
You did what?

494
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,083
You know I'm a litigation solicitor.

495

We have people

00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:08,041
- Oh, hilarious.
- [chuckles]

654
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:09,125
[both laugh]

655
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:11,541
I, uh… I think
I've got the measure of her.

656
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:18,250
So, how is the motor business these days?

657
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,280
You know, it couldn't be better.

658
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,791
[father] It'll all end in tears.
You mark my words.

659
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:25,875
- Too much debt around.
- I don't know about that.

660
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:29,541
Make hay while the sun shines,
as they say.

661
00:41:31,166 --> 00:41:32,458
[Alice] Thank you.

662
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,666
[mother] And what are your plans
for the future?

663
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,125
- Mum!
- We're not asking him to marry you, Al.

664
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:41,916
We're just asking what his plans are.

665
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,166
- Dad!
- [Robert] It's okay.

666
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:46,791
Uh, well, Madeleine, my plans are, um…

667
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:49,958
My plans are to make the most of things.

668
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,041
Right.

669
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:55,750
Actually, Alice and I are thinking
about starting a little business together.

670
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,666
Leasing cars.

671
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,541
What? No, Alice is a lawyer.
She's a bloody good one.

672
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:07,916
I'm not leaving my job, Dad.
It's just a side project.

673
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,333
Side project?

674
00:42:09,416 --> 00:42:12,708
You're an entrepreneur, aren't you,
Richard? You can't blame us for trying.

675
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:16,625
[sighs] Everyone always wants more
than what's in front of them, don't they?

676
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:21,083
You know, I don't think it is about
wanting more, at least not materially.

677
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:24,125
What is it about, then?

678
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:26,500
[Robert] Oh, it's about…

679
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,625
Oh, it's about freedom.

680
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:35,375
[sighs]

681
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:38,291
- [horns blaring]
- [Robert] Oh my God!

682
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:40,375
- They hated me.
- [Alice laughs]

683
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:42,541
No, my mum liked you.

684
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:44,958
But, yeah, Dad hated you.

685
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:48,625
- Yeah. I talk too much.
- [laughs] So does he.

686
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:52,625
- Two bloody stags in a clearing.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

687
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:55,833
- My antlers are bigger than his, though.
- [laughs]

688
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:59,666
[Robert chuckles] Maybe he is right
about the business.

689
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:04,333
Maybe we should just stay in our lane, eh?

690
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:05,958
No!

691
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,875
We should do it.

692
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:09,833
We should.

693
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,666
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

694
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,000
- [both chuckling]
- Oh!

695
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:17,291
- [kisses] Aah! Okay, we're doing it.
- Yeah. Don't listen to my dad.

696
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:28,125
[train passing]

697
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:34,333
- It's time to move on.
- Now?

698
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:35,500
Now.

699
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,625
- What about my stuff?
- Leave it.

700
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:39,833
[sighs]

701
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:41,333
Have we been compromised?

702
00:43:41,416 --> 00:43:43,291
- I was so careful.
- No.

703
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:45,333
[inhales]

704
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:47,583
No, you, uh…

705
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,583
You got the place.

706
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:54,000
- On the field officer training program.
- What? [sobs]

707
00:43:54,708 --> 00:43:57,416
- [chuckles] You've been selected.
- What?

708
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,791
- [sobs]
- [laughs]

709
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:02,500
- [gasps] Oh my God.
- Your days of being a freelancer are over.

710
00:44:02,583 --> 00:44:03,666
[laughs]

711
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,791
Now, listen.
It doesn't start for a little while.

712
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,916
I'll find you
somewhere to stay until then.

713
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:12,833
- [sighs] It is happening.
- [sobbing]

714
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:18,416
Hey. Come on.

715
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,958
[sniffles] Sorry.

716
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:23,208
Congratulations, Sophie.

717
00:44:23,916 --> 00:44:26,458
- Nobody deserves this more than you.
- [laughs]

718
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,125
[both laughing]

719
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,791
[gasps] Oh my God.

720
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:33,125
Come on. Let's go.

721
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:34,916
- [kids yelling]
- [whistle blows]

722
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:38,958
[distant siren wailing]

723
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:46,416
- I didn't wanna talk over the phone.
- Okay.

724
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,875
This guy you asked me
to check out, the ghost.

725
00:44:50,541 --> 00:44:52,666
Oh, yeah. No, that's all been resolved.

726
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:56,125
Oh. Well, I managed to do
a little bit more digging.

727
00:45:00,416 --> 00:45:01,458
Go on.

728
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:05,791
So, we know Robert Hansen
doesn't exist, not officially.

729
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:07,583
But I did find, in the court records,

730
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:11,125
a couple of minor judgments
against a Robert Hansen-Freegard.

731
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:14,458
Nothing serious, mind you, but, well,

732
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:18,250
I like to do a thorough job,
so I ran all the iterations.

733
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:19,333
Robert Hansen,

734
00:45:20,291 --> 00:45:23,958
Robert Hansen-Freegard,
and Robert Freegard.

735
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:26,375
Court documents?

736
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:28,541
Sealed court documents, no less.

737
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:31,625
They're relating to someone
called Robert Freegard.

738
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:34,125
Date of birth, May 21st, 1967.

739
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:37,750
1991, he had a brush with the court.

740
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,833
Up in front of a judge, on the receiving
end of a non-molestation order.

741
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:44,875
A few years later,
he successfully had that set aside.

742
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:46,708
Or somebody did.

743
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:48,833
Wh... what was it about?

744
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:52,833
The allegation was for stalking
and harassment of a young woman.

745
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:56,541
Julie Harper. Wouldn't leave her alone.
Made her life hell, it seems.

746
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:59,375
I couldn't find the girl,
but I managed to get a phone number

747
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:02,375
for a Bridget Harper,
who I'm pretty sure is her mother.

748
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,166
Anything else?

749
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:07,875
No.

750
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:09,958
No, thank you.

751
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:21,708
[sighs]

752
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:31,208
[Robert sighs]

753
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,625
- How was work?
- Good. Good

754
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:40,000
Is everything okay?

755
00:46:40,666 --> 00:46:41,666
Great.

756
00:46:43,541 --> 00:46:44,583
[Robert chuckles]

757
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:49,416
Have you heard from my employers yet?

758
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,916
- Your employers?
- Yeah.

759
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:55,291
They haven't tried
to shit-test you, have they?

760
00:46:55,791 --> 00:46:56,958
"Shit-test"?

761
00:46:57,041 --> 00:47:00,000
Throw some crap at you.
Something unexpected.

762
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,583
See if it sticks.

763
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:04,750
It helps them draw up
a psych profile of you.

764
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:06,735
What do you mean, throw some crap?

765
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:08,671
Pfft. I don't know.
They can be pretty creative.

766
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:13,125
They don't always do it,
so, uh… forget I said anything.

767
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:16,375
No, um… I mean, what... what kind of crap?

768
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:19,083
Um… [sighs]

769
00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:20,750
I don't know. Some bullshit about me.

770
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:24,583
Something to throw you off guard.
Test your loyalty to me.

771
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,958
[laughs] Honestly,
they probably won't do it.

772
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:32,458
And even if they did,
I know that you would handle it perfectly,

773
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:34,958
so forget I said it.

774
00:47:36,916 --> 00:47:38,666
Ready. Here we go.

775
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:41,125
[chuckles]

776
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:43,000
- Try this.
- Mmm!

777
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:48,375
There was actually one more thing
I wanted to say to you.

778
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:51,250
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Um…

779
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:53,333
[tuts]

780
00:47:53,791 --> 00:47:54,791
[sighs]

781
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,500
I love you.

782
00:48:03,541 --> 00:48:04,666
Right, let's eat.

783
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:10,000
[sighs]This is the best bolognese
that you have ever eaten.

784
00:48:10,083 --> 00:48:11,250
I promise you that.

785
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:15,916
Mmm.

786
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:22,458
[sighs]

787
00:48:27,916 --> 00:48:29,083
Uh

788
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,333
[sighs]

789
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:42,583
Okay, then. Shit-test me.

790
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:44,500
- [dialing]
- [sighs]

791
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,291
[ringing tone]

792
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,541
- [woman] <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello. Mrs. Harper?

793
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:57,416
<i>That's right. How can I help you?</i>

794
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,541
Hi, uh, my name's Alice Archer.

795
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:01,625
I'm sorry to bother you. Uh...

796
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:05,208
I need to talk to you
about someone your daughter used to know.

797
00:49:06,416 --> 00:49:08,208
His name is Robert Freegard.

798
00:49:08,875 --> 00:49:10,333
[Bridget gasps]

799
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:14,958
Mrs. Harper?

800
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,250
Hey, babe.

801
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:24,541
Ooh, you look incredible. [groans]

802
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:27,458
This is nice.

803
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:31,333
I was speaking to someone
that used to know you today.

804
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:34,333
She told me the most extraordinary story.

805
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:36,583
Oh?

806
00:49:36,666 --> 00:49:37,791
Bridget Harper.

807
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:39,583
Mother of Julie Harper?

808
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,125
She told me that, years ago,
you and Julie had a whirlwind romance.

809
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:49,666
She borrowed 20 grand off her parents
to get married, but it never happened.

810
00:49:50,916 --> 00:49:51,916
[chuckles]

811
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,708
- I did tell you this was gonna happen.
- Oh, fuck off.

812
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,291
There was a court case. You harassed her.

813
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:03,375
- Are you telling me this is all made up?
- Not all of it, no.

814
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:05,125
Ahem…

815
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:08,375
[laughs]

816
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,458
Julie was my first girlfriend.

817
00:50:13,666 --> 00:50:15,958
Thought I loved her.
Maybe I did. I don't know.

818
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:19,833
Uh… She drank, a lot.

819
00:50:20,333 --> 00:50:23,500
At first, I excused it,
thought it was normal, but it wasn't.

820
00:50:24,666 --> 00:50:27,625
She was, uh… she was an alcoholic. It was…

821
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:32,708
It was horrible. She's actually
the reason I gave up drinking.

822
00:50:34,583 --> 00:50:36,791
Eventually, I persuaded her
to go into rehab.

823
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:39,916
We found a place.
It was private, expensive.

824
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:45,166
She borrowed the money off her parents,
but she never told them why she needed it.

825
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,833
Then the night before she was meant to go,
she just disappeared.

826
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:52,666
I guess she really didn't want
to give up drinking.

827
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:55,791
I tried to find her, of course I did.

828
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:57,583
And yeah.

829
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:01,208
Yeah, she complained to the police
to keep me away.

830
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:03,541
I went to court.

831
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:06,583
Judge threw it out
in about five minutes flat.

832
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,750
This came out in my clearance interviews
when I applied for the service.

833
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:14,041
That's why it's coming up.

834
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:16,291
They use this
when they do this kind of thing.

835
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:19,208
- But the woman I spoke to...
- Is Bridget, and, yes, she's real.

836
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:23,000
This is what she really thinks.
I can't change her mind. No one will.

837
00:51:23,583 --> 00:51:26,833
Oh, and by the way, the person
who gave you all this information?

838
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:30,125
They're working for us.
I imagine, as a freelancer.

839
00:51:31,666 --> 00:51:32,666
But why?

840
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:37,416
- I mean, why?
- To see if you'll trust me in a crisis.

841
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:43,291
[sighs]

842
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:44,375
[chuckles]

843
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:48,875
Where are you going?

844
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:54,125
Uh, I'm gonna work out
if I wanna spend the rest of my life

845
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:58,958
with someone whose job has turned them
into a cynical, entitled bitch.

846
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,000
[phone rings]

847
00:52:20,125 --> 00:52:21,166
Hello?

848
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:23,541
[man] <i>Hello. Is this Alice Archer?</i>

849
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:25,375
Yes.

850
00:52:26,416 --> 00:52:29,500
<i>I'm sorry to bother you, but I was given
your number earlier today</i>

851
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:30,708
<i>by Bridget Harper.</i>

852
00:52:32,208 --> 00:52:35,000
<i>I'm calling
in relation to Robert Freegard.</i>

853
00:52:35,666 --> 00:52:36,666
Who is this?

854
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,750
<i>My name is Paul Jones.</i>

855
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:41,208
<i>Robert Freegard has…</i>

856
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:45,500
<i>Well, he has kidnapped
my daughter, Sophie.</i>

857
00:52:45,583 --> 00:52:48,000
I'm sorry, but you need to stop this now.

858
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:53,333
This is an infringement of my privacy
and that of my partner. This is obscene.

859
00:52:58,166 --> 00:52:59,166
[sighs]

860
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:01,833
[phone rings]

861
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:28,708
[horse neighs]

862
00:53:39,708 --> 00:53:41,750
[Paul] That's just before
she went to college.

863
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,041
Before it all happened.

864
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:49,958
And so she just disappeared?

865
00:53:52,208 --> 00:53:55,791
Her, another girl,
and a young man called Ian Preston.

866
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:58,000
His people are from Burley Vale.

867
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:03,291
He came home, eventually.

868
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,083
Sophie didn't.

869
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:10,791
Obviously, we involved the police.

870
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:14,208
After a few days, she called. [sighs]

871
00:54:14,291 --> 00:54:15,833
She said that she was safe,

872
00:54:15,916 --> 00:54:19,958
that they were doing something important,
and that they would be gone for some time.

873
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:23,708
The police lost interest after that.

874
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,750
So why do you say she was kidnapped?

875
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:29,708
Do you think
she was making the call under duress?

876
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:33,375
Not duress exactly. More like… [sighs]

877
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:35,208
More like what?

878
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:38,166
He brainwashed her.

879
00:54:45,041 --> 00:54:47,000
- Where are we?
- One last mission.

880
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:48,791
- [gasps] But I thought...
- Hey.

881
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:50,666
No questions.

882
00:54:57,375 --> 00:54:59,166
[Paul] Of course I tried to find them.

883
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:03,083
I traced her credit card withdrawals
all over the country.

884
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:06,083
But I was always two steps behind.

885
00:55:06,875 --> 00:55:09,041
I thought,
if only I could see her face-to-face,

886
00:55:09,125 --> 00:55:11,416
I could jolt her out of this madness,

887
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,666
but I never could.

888
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:16,250
It was a phone call here, a letter there.

889
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:21,166
Never asking how we were.
Never saying she missed us.

890
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:23,791
- Just only ever asking for money.
- Money?

891
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:25,333
That's all she ever wanted.

892
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:30,083
In the end, she asked for her share
of the inheritance. She wanted it now.

893
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:32,458
Before we died.

894
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,166
And did you give her the money?

895
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:41,250
[Paul sighs] Yes.

896
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:43,708
I realize now
it was the wrong thing to do.

897
00:55:45,916 --> 00:55:48,125
How much did you end up giving her?

898
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:52,708
About £300,000.

899
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:42,000
If there's any way
you could get him to lead you to her,

900
00:56:42,083 --> 00:56:43,416
any way at all…

901
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:45,750
Ah… I mean, I…

902
00:56:46,416 --> 00:56:48,041
I don't really…

903
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:50,583
- How?
- [Paul] You're still close to him.

904
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:53,583
If you could keep it that way
a while longer,

905
00:56:53,666 --> 00:56:55,833
maybe he could tell you where she is.

906
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:58,333
Find something out, anything.

907
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,291
I, uh... I can't promise anything.

908
00:57:00,958 --> 00:57:02,875
I've got so much to think about.

909
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:07,250
Thank you.

910
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:09,458
And…

911
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:11,375
I'm sorry.

912
00:57:13,958 --> 00:57:17,166
Do you believe in God, Miss Archer?

913
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:18,750
And the devil?

914
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:23,541
I, uh… I don't really think about it.

915
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:24,708
Well, I do.

916
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:29,083
I believe that some people
have been put on this Earth

917
00:57:29,166 --> 00:57:31,000
to be the agents of one or the other.

918
00:57:31,666 --> 00:57:33,625
Robert Freegard is such an agent,

919
00:57:34,708 --> 00:57:36,125
and he's not the Lord's.

920
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:04,541
Alice Archer.

921
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,583

Oh.

00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,916
- Hey.
- Hi.

926
00:58:35,375 --> 00:58:37,916
I called you at work today.
They said you were out.

927
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I was.

928
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:41,583
- Where were you?
- [cork pops]

929
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:43,583
I was at a meeting.

930
00:58:49,375 --> 00:58:50,416
[sighs]

931
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:02,125
We need to talk.

932
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:11,083
I'm sorry.

933
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:13,875
What for?

934
00:59:14,833 --> 00:59:16,250
Sorry I doubted you.

935
00:59:17,791 --> 00:59:18,916
I had a choice.

936
00:59:19,958 --> 00:59:23,666
To believe you, to put my faith in you,
or to let you down.

937
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:26,416
And I let you down.

938
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:30,666
It won't happen again.

939
00:59:32,041 --> 00:59:33,250
I love you.

940
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:35,875
[chuckles]

941
00:59:44,291 --> 00:59:45,625
I'm here for you.

942
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:48,625
Always.

[Sophie sighs]

Oh God, I don't think I can.

950
01:00:22,875 --> 01:00:25,500
You do not question me
in the middle of a mission.

951
01:00:30,708 --> 01:00:33,791
[man] Can't decide
whether to buy them or sue them.

952
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:36,583
- [sighs]
- What do we think? A takeover?

953
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:40,416
Or do we go to war with them?
Just crush them in litigation?

954
01:00:42,916 --> 01:00:45,541
- Alice? What course of action?
- [gasps]

955
01:00:48,916 --> 01:00:50,041
Um…

956
01:00:50,958 --> 01:00:51,958
Sorry.

957
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:56,916
I pay a lot of money for your advice.

958
01:00:57,708 --> 01:00:59,916
The very least I expect is your attention.

959
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,041
Of course.

Oh, you bastard.

You fucking bastard.

963
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,708

Miss Archer. DC Sonny Chandra,
Greater London Police.

968
01:01:57,458 --> 01:01:58,541
Yeah. Come in.

969
01:02:02,291 --> 01:02:04,000
[Sonny sighs]

970
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:09,208
We, uh checked with our colleagues
in security services.

971
01:02:09,291 --> 01:02:12,666
He's not one of theirs. Never has been.

972
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:14,916
No, of course not.

973
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:18,500
- In terms of the money he's withdrawn...
- Stolen.

974
01:02:19,333 --> 01:02:23,041
Well, on that point, because he was
a joint signatory on the business account,

975
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:24,583
it makes it a bit more complicated.

976
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:25,708
What do you mean?

977
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:30,375
We need to hear his side of the story
to establish if a crime's been committed.

978
01:02:30,458 --> 01:02:31,916
You're not serious?

979
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,166
[sorry]

980
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I'm sorry.

[Sonny sighs]

Try not to feel too bad.
This kind of thing happens all the time.

01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,583
More often than you think.

984
01:02:47,416 --> 01:02:50,375
He knew I knew. Then he moved first.

985
01:02:51,125 --> 01:02:52,583
I'm a fucking idiot.

986
01:02:54,958 --> 01:02:57,666
- You don't have to agree.
- Wh... No, no, I was…

987
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,541
Sorry, I was just…

Is that what she told you?

996
01:03:41,416 --> 01:03:43,333
[chuckles] Look,

997
01:03:43,916 --> 01:03:48,166
we've had a couple of disagreements
about how to proceed with our business.

998
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:52,166
Uh, I've withdrawn a sum of money,
which I'm legally entitled to do,

999
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:54,541
in order to purchase a fleet of cars.

1000
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:57,916
[laughing] But I can assure you,
there is no fraud.

1001
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,708
Would you be willing to attend
a police station to discuss it?

1002
01:04:00,791 --> 01:04:02,041
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

1003
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:05,000

- Okay.

1005
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:11,625
Yep, fine. It's the Notting Hill station.
Ask for me at the front desk. Chandra.

1006
01:04:11,708 --> 01:04:13,208
Great. I'll see you then.

I'm looking forward

all these years?

1018
01:05:37,958 --> 01:05:40,916
- To be a field officer.
- And what is the role of a field officer?

1019
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:44,458
To blend in and survive
over a long time in any environment.

Inconspicuous, self-reliant, tough.

- When?
- Will you ask that question in the field?

1024
01:06:00,416 --> 01:06:02,458
Well, consider yourself in the field.

This is in case I need to contact you.

1026

There's no credit on it.
Incoming calls only.

- Really.

Andrew, tell me straight.

Should I look for another job?

When you're doing that job,
you deal with three types of people.

Mad, sad, and bad.

1122
01:12:43,583 --> 01:12:46,000
"Mad" are people
with everyday mental health problems.

1123
01:12:46,083 --> 01:12:47,791
They get in trouble without wan

1124
01:12:47,875 --> 01:12:51,458
"Sad" are people who've had shit lives.
It's obvious why they end up criminals.

1125
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:54,833
Those two are your vast majority
of perpetrators, but…

1126
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:58,208
"Bad" is a different story.

1127
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:01,833
Sociopaths, psychopaths,
fantasists, manipulators.

1128
01:13:01,916 --> 01:13:05,041
They spend their entire lives
destroying other people.

1129
01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:08,125
They're smart,
they're always one step ahead,

01:13:08,208 --> 01:13:10,083
and they all have one thing in common.

1131
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:11,291
What's that?

1132
01:13:11,375 --> 01:13:13,208
[sighs] They can't change.

1133
01:13:13,291 --> 01:13:15,708
They do what they do again,
and again, and again,

1134
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:18,166
and they never, ever stop.

1135
01:13:19,916 --> 01:13:23,666
The only thing you can do is try
to stay as far away from them as possible.

1136
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:26,541
The last thing you wanna do
is ever see him again.

1137
01:13:26,625 --> 01:13:29,250
Try to find a way
to put things back together.

1138
01:13:29,333 --> 01:13:33,583
- Loads of firms need people like you.
- No, that's all over now. I'm done.

1139
01:13:42,041 --> 01:13:43,041
Phil.

1140
01:13:44,041 --> 01:13:45,041
Alice.

1141
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:52,000
Would it surprise you
if I don't take your advice?

1142
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:54,125
[chuckles] Course it bloody wouldn't.

1143
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:55,500
But for God's sake,

1144
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,708
be careful.

1145
01:13:57,791 --> 01:13:59,958
You're not gonna get better
than nine grand.

1146
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:01,666
You can... Daniel will attest to it.

1147
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:04,875
- Right-oh.
- Mmm.

1148
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:06,500
Right-oh. So…

1149
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,500
- Wanna take a test drive?
- Yeah.

1150
01:14:09,291 --> 01:14:11,416
- Hi.
- Hello.

1151
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:14,833
Any idea what you're looking for?

1152
01:14:17,333 --> 01:14:18,583
[laughs]

1153
01:14:36,916 --> 01:14:38,833
- Ian Preston?
- Yes.

1154
01:14:38,916 --> 01:14:41,000
Hi. I'm Alice Archer.

1155
01:14:41,583 --> 01:14:43,916
I need to talk to you
about Robert Freegard.

1156
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:49,875
For two years,
we lived on the run from the IRA.

1157
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:53,500
We used fake names,
always moving from one place to the next.

1158
01:14:54,458 --> 01:14:57,416
He told us the IRA wanted to kill us
to make an example of us.

1159
01:14:57,916 --> 01:15:01,250
He said if we ever went home
to our families, we'd put them in danger.

1160
01:15:01,333 --> 01:15:04,625
As time went on, he told us
we were candidates for a special program.

1161
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:05,833
A program?

1162
01:15:05,916 --> 01:15:07,916
A recruitment program to join MI5.

1163
01:15:08,625 --> 01:15:10,083
To make us officers like him.

1164
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:12,416
But to qualify,
we'd have to pass these tests.

1165
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:13,791
What kind of tests?

1166
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:15,125
Spy stuff.

1167
01:15:15,916 --> 01:15:19,166
Delivering an envelope somewhere.
Following someone in the street.

1168
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:20,750
To prove you were good enough.

1169
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,375
And how long did all this go on for?

1170
01:15:23,875 --> 01:15:24,916
For me, it was…

1171
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:26,583
Four years.

1172
01:15:28,333 --> 01:15:29,750
I know it sounds ridiculous,

1173
01:15:29,833 --> 01:15:33,000
but he just has this way
of making you believe…

1174
01:15:34,083 --> 01:15:35,166
You know, anything.

1175
01:15:35,833 --> 01:15:37,833
It doesn't sound ridiculous to me.

1176
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,291
[birds squawking]

1177
01:15:40,375 --> 01:15:42,375
[sheep bleating]

1178
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:44,458
[sighs]

1179
01:15:45,083 --> 01:15:46,208
He told me something once.

1180
01:15:47,416 --> 01:15:50,416
It was a… a throwaway thing,
but I never forgot it.

1181
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:51,666
[rooster crows]

1182
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:54,625
He said everybody's got a story
that they wanna be told.

1183
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,000
What was your story?

1184
01:15:59,708 --> 01:16:01,375
Well, look around you. [chuckles]

1185
01:16:02,083 --> 01:16:03,250
I'm a farm boy.

1186
01:16:03,916 --> 01:16:06,666
A simple life. Boring, mostly.

1187
01:16:07,375 --> 01:16:09,083
He gave me the opposite of boring.

1188
01:16:11,083 --> 01:16:12,875
What was the story you wanted to hear?

1189
01:16:16,125 --> 01:16:17,666
That I could be free.

1190
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,083
[sighs]

1191
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,375
Ian, can I ask you,

1192
01:16:28,958 --> 01:16:30,458
how did you get away?

1193
01:16:31,541 --> 01:16:33,041
[scoffs] Um…

1194
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:38,083
Well, I... I didn't.

1195
01:16:38,583 --> 01:16:39,750
Mmm…

1196
01:16:39,833 --> 01:16:42,958
Yeah, one day, I woke up,
and... and they were just gone.

1197
01:16:45,916 --> 01:16:47,875
Yeah, I... I didn't leave Freegard. Um…

1198
01:16:48,958 --> 01:16:49,958
He left me.

1199
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:53,958
Him and Sophie and Mae
were... were just gone.

1200
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:55,500
Mae?

1201
01:16:55,875 --> 01:16:58,958
Yeah, Mae Hansen.
Yeah, she was with us for years.

1202
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:00,916
Hansen?

1203
01:17:05,041 --> 01:17:06,750
[distant siren wailing]

1204
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,875
[Sonny] Kidnapping?
He hasn't kidnapped anyone!

1205
01:17:11,958 --> 01:17:15,875
In 1993, he takes three students
from Trent Hamilton University.

1206
01:17:15,958 --> 01:17:18,208
Two of them, young women,
haven't been seen since.

1207
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:21,458
- They got in touch with their families.
- To ask for money.

1208
01:17:21,541 --> 01:17:23,041
Sonny, for fuck's sake.

1209
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,625
Okay, look.

1210
01:17:27,875 --> 01:17:32,083
All right. This is the legal definition
of kidnapping. Read it. Come on. Read it.

1211
01:17:32,166 --> 01:17:34,833
I know what the legal definition is.
This is ridiculous.

1212
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:39,458
"Kidnapping is the taking of one person
or another by force or fraud."

1213
01:17:39,541 --> 01:17:42,541
Fraud is what he's doing.
This is a common-law indictable offense.

1214
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:45,250
- We can make this stick.
- We? Are you a CPS lawyer now?

1215
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:47,041
No, but I'm more of a lawyer than you are.

1216
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:48,291
[silence]

1217
01:17:49,875 --> 01:17:51,208
- I'm sorry.
- [Sonny sighs]

1218
01:17:51,291 --> 01:17:53,041
Sometimes I get a bit carried away.

1219
01:17:53,625 --> 01:17:55,250
Yeah, you don't say, yeah. [sighs]

1220
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:05,250
You say he's been using
Mae Hansen's name?

1221
01:18:05,333 --> 01:18:07,625
Sometimes he uses Robert Hansen.

1222
01:18:07,708 --> 01:18:11,208
Sometimes Robert Hansen-Freegard.
Sometimes just Robert Freegard.

1223
01:18:15,416 --> 01:18:16,833
Well, why would he do that?

1224
01:18:19,291 --> 01:18:20,458
Use her name in particular?

1225
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:27,250
Okay, I'm gonna run Mae Hansen
through the PNC.

1226
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:31,291
If she ever contacted emergency services,
there'll be an address.

1227
01:18:31,375 --> 01:18:33,291
It's not much, but it's worth a try.

1228
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:37,125
But I'm warning you, the chances
of this going anywhere are…well…

1229
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:39,750
Thank you.

1230
01:18:42,875 --> 01:18:44,515
[woman] Have you always lived here alone?

1231
01:18:47,291 --> 01:18:48,291
Mmm...

1232
01:18:48,791 --> 01:18:51,958
I still haven't been down the aisle,
if that's what you mean.

1233
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:54,750
You?

1234
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,125
Yes, unfortunately.

1235
01:18:59,416 --> 01:19:00,416
Wasn't pretty.

1236
01:19:04,708 --> 01:19:05,833
[woman laughs]

1237
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:15,166
[both chuckle]

1238
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:17,041
Sorry.

1239
01:19:17,625 --> 01:19:18,708
[laughs]

1240
01:19:19,208 --> 01:19:21,208
What did you do in America?

1241
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,666
Um… I was an academic, in psychology.

1242
01:19:28,875 --> 01:19:30,708
- Psychology?
- Yeah.

1243
01:19:31,708 --> 01:19:33,583
So you better be careful.

1244
01:19:34,541 --> 01:19:36,333
I can read you from a mile off.

1245
01:19:36,416 --> 01:19:37,416
Oh, I will.

1246
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,958
[both laughing]

1247
01:19:42,166 --> 01:19:43,916
So go on, then. Hmm?

1248
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:46,375
What's your secret?

1249
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,958
- My secret?
- Yeah.

1250
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:54,166
A guy like you. Lives all alone.

1251
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:56,166
Doesn't talk much about his past.

1252
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:59,791
Makes a mean spaghetti bolognese.
[laughs]

1253
01:20:01,666 --> 01:20:03,208
What are you hiding?

1254
01:20:05,625 --> 01:20:06,833
[laughs]

1255
01:20:06,916 --> 01:20:09,416
- Wow, you are good.
- I am! [laughs]

1256
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:12,666
Phew. Uh…

1257
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:15,000
Well, Jenny… [chuckles]

1258
01:20:15,625 --> 01:20:18,750
I had been meaning to...
To tell you something.

1259
01:20:20,208 --> 01:20:21,916
Uh… it's about my job.

1260
01:20:24,666 --> 01:20:26,291
I'm not really a car salesman.

1261
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:30,708
[thunder rumbling]

1262
01:20:30,791 --> 01:20:32,125
[heavy rainfall]

1263
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:47,125
[dog barking]

1264
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:59,375
[gulls calling]

1265
01:21:00,208 --> 01:21:02,375
[Jenny] Mm. I love this place.

1266
01:21:03,416 --> 01:21:04,708
[Robert] Yeah, me too.

1267
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:12,833
Have you ever considered
doing something completely different?

1268
01:21:13,541 --> 01:21:14,541
What do you mean?

1269
01:21:15,916 --> 01:21:17,625
I mean, like a new career.

1270
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:20,708
[laughs] Like what?

1271
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:24,458
Well, this is gonna sound
completely crazy…

1272
01:21:24,541 --> 01:21:26,083
[chuckles] Go on.

1273
01:21:28,666 --> 01:21:29,833
Uh…

1274
01:21:32,291 --> 01:21:35,708
Well, there's a recruitment round
coming up.

1275
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:37,625
At work.

1276
01:21:38,708 --> 01:21:40,208
For intelligence analysts.

1277
01:21:40,291 --> 01:21:42,000
[laughs] What?

1278
01:21:43,166 --> 01:21:44,791
Oh my God.

1279
01:21:44,875 --> 01:21:47,416
What? You think I should become a spy?

1280
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:50,375
No, you wouldn't be a field officer,
you'd be an analyst.

1281
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:52,625
[laughs]

1282
01:21:52,708 --> 01:21:54,833
You have a background in psychology.

1283
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:57,958
You can read people,
work out their motivations.

1284
01:21:58,041 --> 01:22:01,041
I... I think you'd be really,
really good at it.

1285
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:04,791
- But I'm American.
- We recruit NATO allies all the time.

1286
01:22:06,666 --> 01:22:08,041
- [laughs]
- [sighs]

1287
01:22:09,375 --> 01:22:12,500
[sighs] Robert,
I gotta tell you something.

1288
01:22:13,958 --> 01:22:16,000
Oh, God. Um, okay, here goes.

1289
01:22:16,083 --> 01:22:18,500
Um… I am actually on a…

1290
01:22:19,541 --> 01:22:22,208
Pretty intense cocktail
of antidepressants.

1291
01:22:22,958 --> 01:22:24,125
Since my divorce.

1292
01:22:25,625 --> 01:22:27,333
So… [sighs]

1293
01:22:29,166 --> 01:22:32,750
So? I don't see why
that would be a problem.

1294
01:22:37,083 --> 01:22:38,166
[chuckles]

1295
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,833
- And a mushy pea?
- [laughs] Gross.

1296
01:22:44,916 --> 01:22:46,500
- Really?
- Yeah!

1297
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:50,625
Listen, Jenny, uh…

1298
01:22:50,708 --> 01:22:52,583
- If you are gonna take this job…
- Mmm?

1299
01:22:52,666 --> 01:22:55,500
There are a couple of things
we need to discuss.

1300
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:01,750
You mentioned you had
a lot of student debt?

1301
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:03,750
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1302
01:23:04,875 --> 01:23:07,000
It might turn out
to be a bit of a problem.

1303
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:09,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

1304
01:23:09,083 --> 01:23:12,208
Everyone who goes to college
in the States is in debt.

1305
01:23:13,125 --> 01:23:14,000
Yeah, I know.

1306
01:23:14,083 --> 01:23:18,833
In this country, uh, the security services
see large debts owed by members of staff

1307
01:23:18,916 --> 01:23:21,083
as a potential liability.

1308
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,750
- Yeah, like a blackmail risk.
- [laughs]

1309
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:26,083
- Really? Are you kidding me?
- No.

1310
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:28,416
- [laughs]
- I know. It's ridiculous.

1311
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:31,166
They're just...
They're just so set in their ways.

1312
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:33,083
It's... it's absurd. [tuts]

1313
01:23:34,916 --> 01:23:36,625
How much is it, your student debt?

1314
01:23:37,166 --> 01:23:40,375
[sighs] Shit, I mean,
last time I checked, about…

1315
01:23:41,125 --> 01:23:42,458
$80,000.

1316
01:23:43,875 --> 01:23:46,083
- Yeah. Wow.
- Yeah, that's America.

1317
01:23:46,875 --> 01:23:47,875
Um…

1318
01:23:49,083 --> 01:23:51,666
And you have, uh…
you have no way of paying it back?

1319
01:23:52,166 --> 01:23:54,291
[laughs] I mean, let me check my pockets.

1320
01:23:54,375 --> 01:23:55,708
No. [laughs]

1321
01:23:56,833 --> 01:23:58,791
[clears throat]

1322
01:23:58,875 --> 01:23:59,875
Shit.

1323
01:24:00,791 --> 01:24:01,958
Um…

1324
01:24:02,041 --> 01:24:04,375
Well, listen,
if it really is a problem, I…

1325
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:07,208
I guess I could ask my folks.

1326
01:24:07,291 --> 01:24:08,291
I mean… [sighs]

1327
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:10,208
Maybe I could ask them.

1328
01:24:13,166 --> 01:24:15,166
[Alice] Do you really think
this could be her?

1329
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,291
[Sonny] Date of birth matches.

1330
01:24:19,458 --> 01:24:22,083
- [Alice] Thank you for bringing me along.
- [knocks]

1331
01:24:23,125 --> 01:24:25,291
[Sonny] You just let me
take the lead, okay?

1332
01:24:29,583 --> 01:24:30,708
Mae Hansen?

1333
01:24:33,166 --> 01:24:34,000
Yes.

1334
01:24:34,083 --> 01:24:39,000
Did you attend Trent Hamilton University
with Ian Preston and Sophie Jones?

1335
01:24:41,541 --> 01:24:43,500
- Yes.
- I'm Detective Constable Chandra.

1336
01:24:43,583 --> 01:24:45,125
We're here about Robert Freegard.

1337
01:24:45,208 --> 01:24:48,048
- Or Hansen-Freegard, as he's also known.
- He's not here at the moment.

1338
01:24:49,833 --> 01:24:50,833
May we come in?

1339
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:55,416
[quacking on TV]

1340
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,708
[girl] <i>Oh, Jim!</i>
<i>Oh, the chickens are coming in the boat!</i>

1341
01:24:57,791 --> 01:24:58,916
[Alice] Thank you.

1342
01:24:59,916 --> 01:25:01,916
[quacking]

1343
01:25:02,625 --> 01:25:04,875
[Jim] <i>Depends. I'm going to the forest.</i>

1344
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:06,541
[girl] <i>Please, Jim!</i>

1345
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:07,875
Who are these children?

1346
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:09,583
They're our girls.

1347
01:25:10,458 --> 01:25:11,541
Mine and Rob's.

1348
01:25:18,541 --> 01:25:20,166
[Sonny] How often do you see him?

1349
01:25:22,791 --> 01:25:24,125
He comes and goes.

1350
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:26,708
His work is very important.

1351
01:25:28,583 --> 01:25:30,291
But he looks after you?

1352
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:32,958
You and the children?

1353
01:25:39,375 --> 01:25:40,375
Look, Mae.

1354
01:25:41,416 --> 01:25:42,458
Are you okay?

1355
01:25:44,666 --> 01:25:45,750
Can we help you?

1356
01:25:47,708 --> 01:25:49,541
If you ask for help, I can help you.

1357
01:25:55,916 --> 01:25:57,458
He said this would happen.

1358
01:25:58,208 --> 01:25:59,250
[Alice] What?

1359
01:25:59,333 --> 01:26:03,541
He said you would come
and try to test me to see if I was loyal.

1360
01:26:05,125 --> 01:26:06,208
No, Mae.

1361
01:26:06,791 --> 01:26:08,041
This isn't a test.

1362
01:26:08,125 --> 01:26:10,958
- Unless you've something else to say, go.
- He's in danger.

1363
01:26:12,416 --> 01:26:13,416
What?

1364
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:17,375
Rob may be in danger
because of the important work he does,

1365
01:26:17,458 --> 01:26:20,458
and we need to find him
because we need to warn him.

1366
01:26:21,041 --> 01:26:22,333
That's all I can say.

1367
01:26:23,083 --> 01:26:25,666
You understand? It's national security.

1368
01:26:27,208 --> 01:26:31,166
Now, do you know of anything
that can help us find him?

1369
01:26:31,958 --> 01:26:34,333
- An address, a... a phone number, anything.
- Listen.

1370
01:26:34,416 --> 01:26:36,625
- I think we should...
- Mae, we need to find him.

1371
01:26:36,708 --> 01:26:38,125
We need to warn him.

1372
01:26:38,625 --> 01:26:39,625
Please.

1373
01:26:46,708 --> 01:26:47,833
There's a notebook.

1374
01:26:49,041 --> 01:26:51,541
In his sock drawer.
It has phone numbers in it.

1375
01:26:54,333 --> 01:26:56,293
I can't believe it you did that.
I could be fired.

1376
01:26:56,333 --> 01:26:59,041
It's just mobile phone numbers.
Line after line of them.

1377
01:26:59,125 --> 01:27:00,976
- Must be hundreds.
- It doesn't prove anything.

1378
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,291
Doesn't prove anything? Are you serious?

1379
01:27:03,375 --> 01:27:05,309
- This could be how we track him down!
- Then what?

1380
01:27:05,333 --> 01:27:06,976
- Come on!
- I'm serious. Where's the crime?

1381
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,333
Go on, you're the lawyer. Where?

1382
01:27:08,416 --> 01:27:12,208
And even if we did get all this to court,
what will a jury make of Mae Hansen?

1383
01:27:12,291 --> 01:27:14,875
- She's the mother of his children!
- Don't you see?

1384
01:27:14,958 --> 01:27:16,833
He never ever stops.

1385
01:27:16,916 --> 01:27:19,875
He goes on and on,
destroying people's lives,

1386
01:27:19,958 --> 01:27:21,500
until somebody stops him.

1387
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:26,666
[sighs]

1388
01:27:30,208 --> 01:27:33,708
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
That must have been…

1389
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:37,333
[sighs] That must have been hard,
seeing the kids and that…

1390
01:27:39,666 --> 01:27:40,833
It's not enough.

1391
01:27:42,333 --> 01:27:43,708
None of this is enough.

1392
01:27:45,041 --> 01:27:46,333
[men laughing]

1393
01:27:47,208 --> 01:27:48,416
[Sonny sighs]

1394
01:27:50,375 --> 01:27:51,625
[Alice sighs]

1395
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:57,750
[girl yells] Mum! You don't listen!

1396
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:03,250
[yelling continues]

1397
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:10,666
[man yelling]

1398
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,208
[distant siren wailing]

1399
01:28:26,208 --> 01:28:27,958
[train passing]

1400
01:28:37,833 --> 01:28:39,041
[unavailable tone]

1401
01:28:39,125 --> 01:28:41,875
<i>The number you have dialed
has not been recognized.</i>

1402
01:28:41,958 --> 01:28:43,041
<i>Please check and...</i>

1403
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:57,208
[man yelling]

1404
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:10,041
[sighs]

1405
01:29:14,333 --> 01:29:16,333
[clock ticking]

1406
01:29:22,625 --> 01:29:23,916
[sighs]

1407
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,458
[laughs]

1408
01:29:38,541 --> 01:29:40,791
It is a bit strange
they still haven't called.

1409
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:42,958
It's a lot of money, Robert.

1410
01:29:43,541 --> 01:29:44,541
Takes time.

1411
01:29:48,083 --> 01:29:50,916
Look, I don't have to apply for this job
this time round.

1412
01:29:51,416 --> 01:29:52,416
I can wait.

1413
01:29:53,291 --> 01:29:54,750
I mean, to be honest… [sighs]

1414
01:29:55,666 --> 01:29:57,583
I'm not even really sure I should apply.

1415
01:29:57,666 --> 01:30:00,333
I don't think you realize
that there won't be a next time.

1416
01:30:02,041 --> 01:30:03,041
Oh…

1417
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:07,666
- Robert, what are you doing?
- [sighs]

1418
01:30:10,458 --> 01:30:11,583
What are you doing?

1419
01:30:13,416 --> 01:30:15,041
What the fuck are you doing?

1420
01:30:15,125 --> 01:30:18,041
- You don't need those things.
- Those are my meds! I need my meds!

1421
01:30:18,125 --> 01:30:20,625
No, we're gonna get you off them,
starting today.

1422
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:22,875
Those aren't drugs
you can quit, cold turkey.

1423
01:30:22,958 --> 01:30:25,041
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can. You can.

1424
01:30:25,125 --> 01:30:27,250
Yes, you can. I'm right here, okay?

1425
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:30,500
I'm right here. I'm not gonna let
anything bad happen to you.

1426
01:30:30,583 --> 01:30:32,208
I promise you, Jenny. [chuckles]

1427
01:30:33,083 --> 01:30:34,833
This is a good thing, okay?

1428
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:37,541
It's a good thing. It's a good thing.

1429
01:30:38,916 --> 01:30:39,916
Hey.

1430
01:30:45,958 --> 01:30:47,291
[knocking]

1431
01:30:54,291 --> 01:30:55,500
[knocking]

1432
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:56,583
[Alice groans]

1433
01:30:59,708 --> 01:31:01,083
[clears throat]

1434
01:31:01,166 --> 01:31:03,125
- Out all night again?
- Piss off.

1435
01:31:05,541 --> 01:31:07,708
- You were right.
- What?

1436
01:31:08,375 --> 01:31:09,583
He never stops.

1437
01:31:10,875 --> 01:31:11,875
Can you come with me?

1438
01:31:11,958 --> 01:31:13,250
Where are we going?

1439
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:15,125
To the American embassy.

1440
01:31:18,166 --> 01:31:19,291
Give me ten minutes.

1441
01:31:22,208 --> 01:31:23,208
Five.

1442
01:31:24,375 --> 01:31:27,791
[woman] Thank you for coming, Miss Archer.
Special Agent Harland.

1443
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,000
Please, follow me.

1444
01:31:34,666 --> 01:31:35,916
Have a seat.

1445
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:42,500
So,

1446
01:31:43,125 --> 01:31:46,666
I understand that you have
some experience of this guy.

1447
01:31:47,291 --> 01:31:48,666
What's all this about?

1448
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:55,083
The FBI is concerned about the whereabouts
of an American citizen.

1449
01:31:56,291 --> 01:31:57,333
Jenny Jackson.

1450
01:31:57,833 --> 01:32:01,458
She's been here in the UK
for three months.

1451
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,166
Usually, she calls her parents
several times a week,

1452
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:06,500
but about three weeks ago,

1453
01:32:06,583 --> 01:32:08,833
she darn near fell off
the face of the Earth.

1454
01:32:09,625 --> 01:32:11,291
Then a couple of days ago,

1455
01:32:11,791 --> 01:32:14,041
she called her parents in Connecticut

1456
01:32:14,541 --> 01:32:17,916
and asked them for $80,000.

1457
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,333
She said she needed to clear
her student debt in preparation for a job

1458
01:32:22,416 --> 01:32:25,041
that her boyfriend was providing for her.

1459
01:32:25,583 --> 01:32:29,166
The boyfriend goes by the name
of Robert Freegard.

1460
01:32:31,541 --> 01:32:33,250
[car horns beeping]

1461
01:32:34,125 --> 01:32:36,125
[Harland] Did you get
comms surveillance up on him?

1462
01:32:36,833 --> 01:32:38,291
We never got that far.

1463
01:32:41,416 --> 01:32:43,875
[sighs] I have a notebook.

1464
01:32:45,166 --> 01:32:48,541
It's just numbers.
All his... his burner phones.

1465
01:32:48,625 --> 01:32:51,416
I've called about half of them,
but they're all disconnected.

1466
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,291
Can you show 'em to me?

1467
01:32:55,208 --> 01:32:57,250
- What?
- Agent Harland.

1468
01:32:58,250 --> 01:33:00,666
I don't want your people
calling those numbers.

1469
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:02,791
Excuse me?

1470
01:33:02,875 --> 01:33:05,041
If we get through to Robert or Jenny

1471
01:33:05,125 --> 01:33:07,583
or any of his victims,
they could really screw this up.

1472
01:33:07,666 --> 01:33:11,041
We have just one shot at this. Just one.

1473
01:33:11,125 --> 01:33:16,041
My agents are trained investigators.
Negotiators.

1474
01:33:16,125 --> 01:33:18,416
But they don't know
Robert Freegard like I do.

1475
01:33:19,458 --> 01:33:22,375
- Let me make the calls.
- I can get a court order.

1476
01:33:25,083 --> 01:33:28,083
Actually, you'd need
an evidential retrieval order.

1477
01:33:28,166 --> 01:33:30,125
That's usually a High Court matter.

1478
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:33,333
I see what you mean.

1479
01:33:35,333 --> 01:33:38,083
You make the calls. I listen in.

1480
01:33:38,791 --> 01:33:39,916
We work together.

1481
01:33:40,416 --> 01:33:41,416
Deal.

1482

- Hey.
<i>- The number you have dialed…</i>

1488
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:25,833
Yeah, get me purchase points
on every handset on this list.

1489
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,958
Put 'em all on a map. Plot 'em out.

1490
01:34:29,041 --> 01:34:30,500
Get 'em right to me. Thanks.

Let me call you back.

Um… My name's Alice.

01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:54,750
I'm a... I'm a colleague of Rob's.
I work with him.

<i>Where is Rob?</i>

1503
01:34:56,791 --> 01:34:59,083
I can't discuss that on the phone, Sophie.

1504
01:35:00,041 --> 01:35:02,375
Listen. We're ready to bring you in.

1505
01:35:03,041 --> 01:35:04,416
Oh…

1506
01:35:05,625 --> 01:35:07,375
Have... have I passed?

1507
01:35:09,416 --> 01:35:11,458
That... that's right, Sophie. You have.

1508
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:13,500
<i>You've passed.</i>

1509
01:35:16,625 --> 01:35:18,791
Rob said it would be him
that brought me in.

1510
01:35:19,291 --> 01:35:22,583
<i>He's on a mission.
You'll see him very soon.</i>

1511
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:26,291
Okay.

1512
01:35:26,791 --> 01:35:29,208
Sophie, where are you?

1513
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:31,750
What's your location?

1514
01:35:33,875 --> 01:35:34,875
Um…

1515
01:35:36,916 --> 01:35:37,916
Mom,

1516
01:35:38,708 --> 01:35:40,666
if you could send the money,

1517
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:43,083
it will really help
with this new opportunity.

1518
01:35:43,916 --> 01:35:45,125
This means a lot to me,

1519
01:35:45,208 --> 01:35:48,875
and everything will go smoothly
once the debt has been cleared.

1520
01:35:50,666 --> 01:35:51,666
Mom?

1521
01:35:52,583 --> 01:35:55,291
I really need you
to send this money, okay? Please.

1522
01:36:00,041 --> 01:36:02,041
[breathing shakily]

1523
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:06,666
- I'm really not feeling very well, Robert.
- Sh.

1524
01:36:09,208 --> 01:36:10,583
Can you help me?

[gasping]

1526
01:36:19,791 --> 01:36:21,708
Okay, listen. This is important.

1527
01:36:22,208 --> 01:36:24,625
When we get to her,
we can't tell her the truth.

1528
01:36:24,708 --> 01:36:25,541
Wait. What?

1529
01:36:25,625 --> 01:36:29,958
If we want to find Jenny,
we can't tell Sophie Jones the truth.

1530
01:36:30,041 --> 01:36:31,458
- Not yet.
- [Sonny] Why not?

1531
01:36:32,791 --> 01:36:34,583
Because it would destroy her.

1555
01:39:53,583 --> 01:39:55,791
As part of your training with Rob,

1556
01:39:56,708 --> 01:39:59,166
you stayed in a lot of safe houses, yes?

1557
01:39:59,250 --> 01:40:00,708
Yeah, dozens.

1558
01:40:00,791 --> 01:40:03,541
And did any of them stand out to you?

1559
01:40:04,416 --> 01:40:05,541
What do you mean?

1560
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,083
Do any of them feel different?

1561
01:40:09,166 --> 01:40:12,000
Like, maybe somewhere
that felt more like home.

1562
01:40:14,708 --> 01:40:15,708
Um…

1563
01:40:18,583 --> 01:40:21,583
Well, there... there was one place I…

1564
01:40:22,291 --> 01:40:25,791
- I had to wear a blindfold on the way.
- Yeah, yeah. Exactly like that.

1565
01:40:26,416 --> 01:40:29,208
And do you remember,
even roughly, where it was?

1566
01:40:31,333 --> 01:40:32,958
[Sophie] Well, um…

1567
01:40:33,541 --> 01:40:38,125
Rob taught me that if…
if you're deprived of one of your senses,

1568
01:40:38,208 --> 01:40:41,708
you can learn what you need
to know from the others, so, um…

1569
01:40:42,333 --> 01:40:44,541
We came sou... south out of Cambridge,

1570
01:40:45,166 --> 01:40:48,833
um, and then when we came off the M11,
that's when I put the blindfold on.

1571
01:40:49,791 --> 01:40:50,958
Um…

1572
01:40:51,041 --> 01:40:53,958
So, we went straight
for about ten minutes.

1573
01:40:54,041 --> 01:40:56,041
I counted the seconds. And then…

1574
01:40:56,791 --> 01:41:00,250
We turned left, up into the hills,
for about 30 minutes.

1575
01:41:04,333 --> 01:41:05,333
It fits.

1576
01:41:05,833 --> 01:41:09,500
There's a cluster of handsets that
were purchased right by Saffron Walden.

01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:13,750
Well done.

I'm really sorry. I just…

1582
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:35,666

No, not right now. She's taking a bath.

It... it's all there.</i>

Right.

<i>- Can you tell her that, please</i>?
- I'll let her know.

Hey, listen.

Uh, I think there might be
some of your medicine in the car.

You didn't come here
'cause you wanted to catch me.

You came because you wanted to see

The people they once were.

That was the price they had to pay.

I've gotta ask.

Some of the screws are saying
