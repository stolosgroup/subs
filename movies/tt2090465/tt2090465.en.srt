2
00:02:27,978 --> 00:02:30,937
It's pretty good, though.
Come back here. Oh, come on.

3
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,113
- Yeah, yeah.
- Sam, you get the blanket.

4
00:02:34,213 --> 00:02:36,415
Okay. Sorry.

5
00:02:36,515 --> 00:02:38,327
Catch it, AJ!

6
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:40,601
Come on, kid.

7
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:06,049
Maybe we should go help Mom, huh?
Come on, come on.

8
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:07,951
Come on!

9
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:10,287
You go back and get the blanket
so Mom doesn't kill me.

10
00:03:10,387 --> 00:03:11,922
Yeah.

11
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:24,434
Did you see my wife?

12
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:27,470
No, sorry.

13
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,072
Nancy!

14
00:03:33,575 --> 00:03:35,111
Nancy!

15
00:03:42,484 --> 00:03:44,020
Nancy!

16
00:03:47,857 --> 00:03:49,392
Nancy!

17
00:03:53,028 --> 00:03:54,598
Nancy!

18
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:17,157
It's beautiful, isn't it?
More secluded than I thought.

19
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,788
It was sunny 10 minutes ago.

20
00:04:18,888 --> 00:04:21,057
I love it. This is exactly
what I've been looking for.

21
00:04:21,157 --> 00:04:23,571
Mr. Lopez, I'm sorry to show up
like this. I tried to call you.

22
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:26,830
The reception here is...
but I'm sure it's just my phone.

23
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,377
Is it okay if I show
Mr. and Mrs. Owen around?

24
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,906
- Nice to meet you. Paul. Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

25
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,293
Sure, look around. I can't stay,
I'm afraid. I was on my way out.

26
00:04:36,393 --> 00:04:39,209
Oh, no, that's okay.
It's probably better if you're not here.

27
00:04:39,309 --> 00:04:43,079
Hey, listen. The house is a real mess,
especially the kitchen.

28
00:04:43,179 --> 00:04:46,182
Oh, I'll take care of it.
I'll tell them you had guests.

29
00:04:46,282 --> 00:04:49,507
- Yes, really messy guests.
- Don't worry.

30
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:53,391
Can we meet for a late lunch this afternoon?

31
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:57,827
Just to talk about the house
and some other stuff.

32
00:04:57,927 --> 00:05:00,547
- Yeah, of course.
- Alright, Brent's two o'clock?

33
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:02,599
- Sure. Good.
- Good, good. All right.

34
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,534
- See you then. Okay.
- Cool.

35
00:05:04,634 --> 00:05:08,072
- Hope you like what you see.
- Come on, I'll show you inside.

36
00:06:54,076 --> 00:06:57,447
To recap our top story, police
have confirmed that a young woman...

37
00:06:57,547 --> 00:06:59,955
...has been murdered in Jefferson County.

38
00:07:00,055 --> 00:07:02,786
This is the fourth
young woman in three years.

39
00:07:02,886 --> 00:07:06,088
In other news, the Rockies
lost another close one...

40
00:07:06,188 --> 00:07:10,258
...as the Mets came to town
and annihilated them.

41
00:07:11,427 --> 00:07:13,062
Hey, Pat.

42
00:07:13,162 --> 00:07:14,697
Hey, Paul.

43
00:07:14,797 --> 00:07:18,668
Hey, do you know they pay $36,000
a year to house one convict?

44
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:22,905
Yeah, read it in the paper.
School teachers make less.

45
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:26,209
- Bring your list?
- Yeah.

46
00:07:26,725 --> 00:07:29,462
A few additions. There you go.

47
00:07:30,846 --> 00:07:32,716
You gonna square up?

48
00:07:33,616 --> 00:07:36,686
I'll give it to Hank on delivery, Wednesday.

49
00:07:36,786 --> 00:07:38,388
Is that all right with you?

50
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:41,491
- Go hunting today?
- Just got back.

51
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:45,328
- Get lucky?
- Yeah. I got a goose.

52
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:47,263
Nice one.

53
00:07:55,904 --> 00:07:58,744
- Hey, Marty?
- Hey, Paul, what's going on?

54
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:01,978
Did you get my messages?
I've been clogging up your voicemail.

55
00:08:02,078 --> 00:08:06,149
Reception sucks in here, man.
So, listen, did you get the script?

56
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:09,619
Yeah. I sent it back to you
already with my comments.

57
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:13,489
You sent it back?
I thought we were rolling out with it.

58
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:15,592
You didn't incorporate any of their notes.

59
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:19,028
If I sent it back as is, they'd never
read anything of yours ever again.

60
00:08:19,128 --> 00:08:22,699
You understand that, Paul?
Once in a while, you gotta compromise...

61
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:26,102
- ...show that you're functional.
- I am.

62
00:08:26,202 --> 00:08:29,839
Not within the system, you're not. Look,
we both know you need the money, right?

63
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:34,210
Well, yes, I need the money,
but not at any cost, you know?

64
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,089
Good line, but I thought
you had bills to pay. Exactly.

65
00:08:38,189 --> 00:08:42,952
Look, just pull yourself together.
Okay, I gotta go. Bye.

66
00:08:43,186 --> 00:08:45,655
Marty. Marty?

67
00:08:48,558 --> 00:08:50,126
Fucker.

68
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:05,356
What the fuck is going on with this guy?

69
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,953
Come on!

70
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:23,793
Jesus Christ.

71
00:09:28,765 --> 00:09:30,567
What the fuck, man?

72
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:57,512
...confirm Nancy Barrows,
46, of Greenville, Colorado...

73
00:09:57,612 --> 00:10:00,122
...is the fourth victim
of the roadside killer.

74
00:10:00,222 --> 00:10:01,798
- Okay.
- Hey, Paul, what's up?

75
00:10:01,998 --> 00:10:05,210
- Okay, thanks, I'll be there.
- Wanna sit at the counter?

76
00:10:06,236 --> 00:10:08,705
- Mr. Lopez.
- Laura. I'm sorry I'm late.

77
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:10,373
- No, it's okay.
- All right.

78
00:10:10,473 --> 00:10:13,076
So, the Owens aren't interested.

79
00:10:14,544 --> 00:10:17,463
- You still wanna buy me lunch?
- Of course.

80
00:10:17,713 --> 00:10:20,617
It's my way of keeping you motivated.

81
00:10:21,617 --> 00:10:24,720
Actually, I can only stay a few minutes.
I had to commit to another appointment.

82
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,689
If you'd been here
just five minutes earlier...

83
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:29,459
- Not even a cup of coffee?
- Already had one.

84
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:32,108
- Just coffee.
- Judy.

85
00:10:34,863 --> 00:10:36,232
Thank you.

86
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:40,503
I have to admit I'm a bit in awe.
I've never known a writer before.

87
00:10:40,603 --> 00:10:42,472
Well, don't be.

88
00:10:43,205 --> 00:10:45,428
I don't know any either.

89
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:49,645
- Why do you say that?
- I haven't written in a long time.

90
00:10:49,745 --> 00:10:52,448
Nothing good, anyway.
You know, can't get it started.

91
00:10:52,548 --> 00:10:54,317
How long?

92
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:58,302
Two years, more.
It's embarrassing. But listen...

93
00:10:59,602 --> 00:11:03,759
...let's talk about real estate
and selling my house instead.

94
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:09,089
The Owens are not interested,
so, what is the next step?

95
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:13,619
I'm not sure. Wait.
I'm not supposed to say that.

96
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:15,578
No, no, you're just being honest.

97
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:20,243
Yeah, I haven't been doing this
very long. Can you tell?

98
00:11:20,943 --> 00:11:22,979
Actually, you're my first.

99
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:27,836
- Your first, what?
- My first victim.

100
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:31,788
That's okay. I don't mind.

101
00:11:31,888 --> 00:11:33,914
No, it's not okay.

102
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,032
I'm sure I can get another
appointment in a couple weeks.

103
00:11:37,132 --> 00:11:40,028
- How long can you hold out?
- Couple of weeks.

104
00:11:40,796 --> 00:11:43,566
So do you think it's gonna take a long time?

105
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,869
Well, it depends. I mean, this time
of year, there's hardly anybody in town.

106
00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:49,660
- I mean, in the summer is better.
- Summer?

107
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,444
- Well, with the tourists and...
- That was you back there, right?

108
00:11:56,912 --> 00:12:00,149
- What? You know that guy?
- Hey, hey, hey.

109
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:03,653
Listen. Listen. Something happened
on my way over here.

110
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:06,943
It was just a bad driver. Just forget it.

111
00:12:07,423 --> 00:12:08,991
Anyway...

112
00:12:09,817 --> 00:12:14,086
...I thought we would have, you know,
an easier time selling the house...

113
00:12:14,186 --> 00:12:17,767
- ...being close to Denver...
- Your house needs a little fixing up...

114
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:20,069
...and, secondly,
it's not that close to Denver.

115
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:23,173
I mean, it's a two-hour drive
just to hit the suburbs.

116
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,809
Have dinner with me.

117
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:29,863
- Mr. Lopez, I...
- No, no, no. It's...

118
00:12:29,963 --> 00:12:34,150
...Pablo, actually. But I like Paul better.

119
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,819
Listen...

120
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:41,191
...we have seen each other,
what, three times now?

121
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:44,708
But every single time, it's bad news.

122
00:12:47,262 --> 00:12:49,131
I can't tonight.

123
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,452
But how about Saturday?

124
00:12:54,302 --> 00:12:57,039
- Great.
- Okay.

125
00:12:57,139 --> 00:12:58,240
Eight o'clock?

126
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,903
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Good.

127
00:13:00,003 --> 00:13:01,577
Okay.

128
00:13:03,612 --> 00:13:06,482
- Bye, Paul.
- Bye.

129
00:13:11,753 --> 00:13:15,024
- Judy.
- Yeah? Coming.

130
00:13:15,424 --> 00:13:17,614
That was a real smart move back there.

131
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:23,866
I shouldn't have done that. I know, yeah.

132
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:28,432
You know, I used to meet a friend of mine
in places like this until an asshole...

133
00:13:28,532 --> 00:13:30,012
...like you ran him off the road!

134
00:13:30,112 --> 00:13:32,280
Hey! Can you keep it down?
I'm trying to watch...

135
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,823
- Fuck off!
- I'm sorry. Just drop it now.

136
00:13:35,923 --> 00:13:39,181
- I won't just drop it!
- Hey, that's it!

137
00:13:54,495 --> 00:13:57,133
Everything's okay, guys, don't worry.

138
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:01,937
Hey, I don't know how to thank you.

139
00:14:05,273 --> 00:14:07,477
I'm sorry, Judy. I...

140
00:14:07,777 --> 00:14:09,897
- I'm sorry.
- It happens.

141
00:14:09,997 --> 00:14:13,215
- Give me that.
- No, it's fine, really.

142
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:18,654
He was an idiot. Jesus.

143
00:14:21,623 --> 00:14:25,095
- Sorry, man. Really sorry.
- No worries.

144
00:15:03,498 --> 00:15:05,300
Thank you.

145
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:07,737
Where are you going?

146
00:15:07,837 --> 00:15:10,085
Just drop me wherever suits you.

147
00:15:17,478 --> 00:15:19,348
I'm Paul.

148
00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:21,917
Jack.

149
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:28,190
You hunt?

150
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,860
Yeah, I got a goose this morning, yeah.

151
00:15:43,204 --> 00:15:46,008
- What do you do?
- I'm a writer.

152
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:47,409
- Really?
- Yeah.

153
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:48,827
Books?

154
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:51,392
Yeah, books, yeah, long time ago.

155
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:55,484
Must be hard work.

156
00:16:00,054 --> 00:16:01,609
Listen...

157
00:16:02,245 --> 00:16:04,210
- ...can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

158
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:08,019
In the fight back there,
what did you say to that guy?

159
00:16:08,597 --> 00:16:11,868
- What did I say?
- Yeah, the man was terrified.

160
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,838
I told him I liked my lunch quiet.

161
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:34,758
So you gonna tell me where you're going?

162
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,827
Just enjoying the road.

163
00:16:40,428 --> 00:16:42,232
You like living like that?

164
00:16:43,232 --> 00:16:45,034
Nothing better.

165
00:16:46,601 --> 00:16:48,404
How do you get by?

166
00:16:48,904 --> 00:16:50,773
I do what I have to do.

167
00:16:51,173 --> 00:16:52,975
Then I move on.

168
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:55,611
Nothing you miss?

169
00:16:57,612 --> 00:17:00,283
You know, hot shower.

170
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:05,220
Some storm?

171
00:17:07,422 --> 00:17:09,291
Pretty bad.

172
00:17:09,691 --> 00:17:12,328
Took out power and telephone lines.

173
00:17:12,628 --> 00:17:14,664
Power only just came back.

174
00:17:19,801 --> 00:17:21,387
Listen...

175
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:25,407
I... I don't wanna drop you on the road...

176
00:17:25,507 --> 00:17:27,676
...with this weather coming out there.

177
00:17:27,776 --> 00:17:30,880
The weather, man. They always get it wrong.

178
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,017
Well, we are close to my place,
and I got a guest room.

179
00:17:35,117 --> 00:17:37,219
You can use it for the night,
have a hot shower.

180
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:40,742
Look, don't feel like you owe me, okay?

181
00:17:41,857 --> 00:17:43,525
It's the least I can do.

182
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,705
I would be at the hospital
without you back there.

183
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,033
Appreciate it.

184
00:18:34,676 --> 00:18:36,478
Here we are.

185
00:18:36,678 --> 00:18:39,782
- You like it?
- Yeah, I like it.

186
00:18:39,882 --> 00:18:41,417
Good.

187
00:18:44,085 --> 00:18:46,042
You must have sold a lot of books.

188
00:18:46,722 --> 00:18:50,192
- I did all right.
- Hey, let me help you.

189
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:52,127
Take that bag.

190
00:18:56,414 --> 00:18:58,899
- Nice kill.
- Well...

191
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:01,854
...I can be a good shot
if I do say so myself.

192
00:19:18,218 --> 00:19:20,883
It is messed up. You gotta be careful.

193
00:19:23,357 --> 00:19:24,794
There.

194
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,765
All right.

195
00:19:33,701 --> 00:19:35,990
Sorry, maid's day off.

196
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:39,708
You have a maid?

197
00:19:41,188 --> 00:19:42,744
No.

198
00:19:43,177 --> 00:19:45,046
Not anymore.

199
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,850
Probably working for my ex.

200
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,286
Is that a joke?

201
00:20:04,165 --> 00:20:07,789
Let me show you to your room. Fuck. Hang on.

202
00:20:08,303 --> 00:20:13,365
Watch your step. My wife made me
put these safety bolts on all windows.

203
00:20:13,465 --> 00:20:15,867
- She was scared, you know.
- Of what?

204
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:18,780
I don't know. Isolation?

205
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:23,685
All right. Here we are.

206
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:27,689
Bathroom is over there, and it has a shower.

207
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:30,426
Sheets and towels in the closet.

208
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:34,529
- Thanks, Paul.
- Yeah, make yourself comfortable.

209
00:21:27,565 --> 00:21:29,502
You have cleaned up.

210
00:21:29,852 --> 00:21:31,686
You hungry?

211
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,745
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

212
00:23:02,845 --> 00:23:07,095
- The water is freezing.
- Yeah, it is. Makes you feel alive.

213
00:23:07,545 --> 00:23:09,768
Could just pinch yourself.

214
00:23:10,786 --> 00:23:12,421
Thanks for breakfast.

215
00:23:15,356 --> 00:23:18,026
I noticed that this door
has to be completely reframed.

216
00:23:18,126 --> 00:23:21,948
Now, I found a few spare planks outside,
but I'm gonna be able to fix that...

217
00:23:22,048 --> 00:23:24,303
- ...before I leave this afternoon.
- No, no, no, no.

218
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,668
You don't have to fix anything.

219
00:23:26,768 --> 00:23:29,571
- Paul, I want to.
- I'm moving.

220
00:23:29,671 --> 00:23:31,840
I need to sell this place.

221
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,276
Why would you give all this up?

222
00:23:34,376 --> 00:23:39,217
Because I can't afford to stay.
You know, can't sell any of my work.

223
00:23:39,648 --> 00:23:42,251
Besides, there's nothing left for me here.

224
00:23:42,951 --> 00:23:44,786
Not without my wife.

225
00:23:47,855 --> 00:23:49,342
I can help you.

226
00:23:50,492 --> 00:23:51,471
No.

227
00:23:51,571 --> 00:23:56,238
No, really. I mean, it's not that much work.
I could have it done in maybe three days.

228
00:23:56,338 --> 00:23:59,241
- Jack. Jack, I can't pay you.
- Perhaps a little bit longer.

229
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:02,671
- Come on.
- Don't worry about it.

230
00:24:08,943 --> 00:24:11,610
I'll do the cooking, deal?

231
00:26:03,257 --> 00:26:05,060
Your wife?

232
00:26:10,564 --> 00:26:13,034
It's the last picture of her...

233
00:26:13,134 --> 00:26:15,950
...before she left me.

234
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:23,979
You know, I should clean
this place up too, right?

235
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:27,726
No, no. I like it like this. Thank you.

236
00:26:30,484 --> 00:26:32,354
You write these?

237
00:26:44,965 --> 00:26:47,873
- El último hombre.
- Yeah, the last man.

238
00:26:52,573 --> 00:26:53,909
Right.

239
00:26:57,045 --> 00:27:00,415
Phone is still not working. No Internet.

240
00:27:01,067 --> 00:27:02,951
Fuck it.

241
00:27:04,318 --> 00:27:07,156
- Yeah.
- You don't need 'em.

242
00:27:08,055 --> 00:27:09,458
Yeah.

243
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:13,779
Anyway, I thought a writer would actually
appreciate being cut off from the world.

244
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:17,498
You know? The seclusion.

245
00:27:18,132 --> 00:27:20,602
Be able to get some work done,
no distractions.

246
00:27:20,702 --> 00:27:24,540
Well, the irony is that we are
always looking for a distraction.

247
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,277
Procrastination, writers thrive on it.

248
00:27:29,377 --> 00:27:32,214
This stew is excellent.

249
00:27:32,614 --> 00:27:34,449
Thank you.

250
00:27:36,183 --> 00:27:37,749
So...

251
00:27:38,381 --> 00:27:40,689
...tomorrow I'm gonna start working the shed.

252
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:44,139
Needs a new coat of paint. And there's
some tiles on your roof that need fixing.

253
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:47,265
You'll never have time to do
all that in three days, Jack.

254
00:27:48,763 --> 00:27:52,401
I said it might take
a little bit longer, didn't I?

255
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:54,003
Right.

256
00:27:54,703 --> 00:27:58,138
I don't mean to pry, but...
don't you writers make a good living?

257
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:02,094
Well, that depends on the writer.

258
00:28:02,194 --> 00:28:04,056
What kind of writer are you?

259
00:28:05,514 --> 00:28:09,751
I had my first novel published when I was 25.

260
00:28:09,851 --> 00:28:13,388
My first bestseller before I turned 30...

261
00:28:13,488 --> 00:28:16,157
...and critics really liked me.

262
00:28:16,257 --> 00:28:19,928
They liked me a lot, so you know,
the word got around...

263
00:28:20,028 --> 00:28:23,097
...and suddenly, well,
this American literary agent...

264
00:28:23,197 --> 00:28:28,235
...flew out to meet me in Madrid, and he
said that the studios were interested...

265
00:28:28,335 --> 00:28:31,239
...to adapt, some of my books to the screen.

266
00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:34,176
And so, for all my sins...

267
00:28:35,843 --> 00:28:38,914
...I signed with him.
So he sold the book, and...

268
00:28:39,014 --> 00:28:41,650
...they got me to write the screenplay...

269
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,590
...and suddenly out of the blue...

270
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:48,757
...you know, they forgot
the agreement, entirely.

271
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:50,926
And they gave it to somebody else to write.

272
00:28:51,026 --> 00:28:53,496
So they kicked you out of your own movie?

273
00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:00,970
- Can't get any worse than that, I guess.
- Oh, yes, it can. It can.

274
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:05,796
The worst part is that
they did make the movie...

275
00:29:06,408 --> 00:29:10,677
...and the only thing left
of my book was the title.

276
00:29:12,212 --> 00:29:13,748
Yep.

277
00:29:16,216 --> 00:29:19,421
I married the woman of my dreams,
I had money...

278
00:29:20,101 --> 00:29:23,565
...an apartment in the Wilshire Corridor,
you know, tons of needy friends...

279
00:29:23,665 --> 00:29:25,961
...and it all went away.

280
00:29:29,496 --> 00:29:31,332
Even the woman.

281
00:29:36,738 --> 00:29:38,625
We're all free men.

282
00:29:39,202 --> 00:29:41,011
We choose what we want.

283
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,881
- You did this to yourself.
- Well, no, all I choose was this place.

284
00:29:45,981 --> 00:29:49,567
I told my wife it would help,
you know, I needed isolation...

285
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:52,923
...to write and that was my sacrifice!

286
00:29:55,022 --> 00:29:58,917
All writing is sacrifice.

287
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:08,369
You know, in most movies I see...

288
00:30:08,469 --> 00:30:12,230
...the characters are just what they are,
characters in a movie.

289
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:16,178
Nothing seems real.
Nothing is like how life really is.

290
00:30:17,711 --> 00:30:19,581
I don't disagree.

291
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:22,051
Maybe it's just 'cause I travel a lot.

292
00:30:22,701 --> 00:30:26,071
You know, I watch what's going on around me.

293
00:30:26,421 --> 00:30:28,223
I watch people.

294
00:30:28,989 --> 00:30:30,826
I'm not a recluse.

295
00:30:31,426 --> 00:30:33,294
Must be it.

296
00:30:33,927 --> 00:30:35,730
You know...

297
00:30:37,297 --> 00:30:40,235
...I'd really like to read
one of your scripts.

298
00:30:40,335 --> 00:30:42,404
If that wouldn't be a problem.

299
00:30:45,906 --> 00:30:47,542
Okay.

300
00:30:47,642 --> 00:30:50,045
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'll...

301
00:30:54,615 --> 00:30:56,295
All right...

302
00:30:56,395 --> 00:30:58,633
...this is the last one I wrote.

303
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:01,723
My hail Mary pass to get something sold.

304
00:31:01,823 --> 00:31:03,658
Nobody wants it.

305
00:31:04,725 --> 00:31:06,552
My agent says it's crap.

306
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:09,265
Under the Clock.

307
00:31:10,864 --> 00:31:12,200
Yeah.

308
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,205
- I think I've heard this title before.
- Even the title, then.

309
00:31:18,465 --> 00:31:20,008
Yeah.

310
00:31:21,191 --> 00:31:22,994
I'll tell you what.

311
00:31:23,544 --> 00:31:26,181
I'll give you the opinion of the common man.

312
00:31:26,411 --> 00:31:30,436
- It's gotta count for something, right?
- It counts for more than my agent's.

313
00:31:31,586 --> 00:31:34,055
Yeah, yes, enjoy it, man.

314
00:31:55,342 --> 00:31:57,118
Good afternoon.

315
00:31:58,579 --> 00:32:00,381
How was your nap?

316
00:32:01,148 --> 00:32:03,751
Not good. Not good.

317
00:32:08,856 --> 00:32:10,883
Delias Kristianiae.

318
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,463
Black Butterfly, from Indonesia.

319
00:32:15,563 --> 00:32:17,332
Very rare.

320
00:32:17,432 --> 00:32:19,301
Very hard to catch.

321
00:32:19,701 --> 00:32:23,175
- Ironic, really.
- Ironic?

322
00:32:23,604 --> 00:32:26,474
Yeah, I had it done in prison.

323
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,826
You looking for these?

324
00:32:45,326 --> 00:32:47,980
I needed to work on the shed,
I had to unlock it.

325
00:32:49,731 --> 00:32:51,600
You gonna work today?

326
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,626
No.

327
00:32:54,199 --> 00:32:58,343
I'm not in the right frame of mind,
and I have to sell this house.

328
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,977
Hard to work when you
got to worry about money.

329
00:33:05,012 --> 00:33:07,239
You know you have to do yourself a favor.

330
00:33:08,918 --> 00:33:10,551
What is that?

331
00:33:10,651 --> 00:33:12,487
You know...

332
00:33:13,454 --> 00:33:15,690
...you have to stop drinking.

333
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:18,027
I mean, you gotta stop it cold.

334
00:33:20,228 --> 00:33:22,297
You could be a great writer.

335
00:33:22,697 --> 00:33:27,103
But your stories are not good enough,
and it's because of your drinking.

336
00:33:29,737 --> 00:33:34,343
You know, I think you just need
a good idea to jumpstart your career.

337
00:33:35,243 --> 00:33:37,779
You know, I was thinking
this morning, I got an idea.

338
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:39,881
- Of course you do.
- No, really.

339
00:33:39,981 --> 00:33:42,183
I mean, I want you to hear it.
All right, look...

340
00:33:42,283 --> 00:33:44,986
...I know it'd be like God taking
advice from a lowly priest.

341
00:33:45,186 --> 00:33:48,023
I am listening, yes. All right.

342
00:33:48,123 --> 00:33:49,658
Okay.

343
00:33:50,158 --> 00:33:51,960
You tell our story.

344
00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:57,599
- What story?
- Our story.

345
00:33:57,699 --> 00:33:59,701
Okay, it goes like this.

346
00:34:00,101 --> 00:34:02,923
A writer travels to the U.S....

347
00:34:03,023 --> 00:34:08,070
...looking for inspiration, gets himself
a beautiful house in a remote area.

348
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,315
And so...

349
00:34:11,045 --> 00:34:13,540
He's had some success...

350
00:34:13,977 --> 00:34:15,483
...short-lived.

351
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:17,882
He can't write anymore, so...

352
00:34:17,982 --> 00:34:19,463
...he drinks.

353
00:34:19,721 --> 00:34:21,790
He's become an alcoholic.

354
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:25,212
And he lives like a recluse
to hide his decline.

355
00:34:26,694 --> 00:34:30,431
So, this writer goes into a diner.

356
00:34:30,531 --> 00:34:33,468
He's got a... a date with a pretty girl.

357
00:34:33,568 --> 00:34:36,404
But today is not gonna be his lucky day.

358
00:34:36,504 --> 00:34:39,573
He gets into it with some pissed off
truck driver looking for trouble...

359
00:34:39,673 --> 00:34:44,092
...who frightens off the girl and then
gets into a fight with the writer.

360
00:34:45,213 --> 00:34:48,149
So for sure, this writer's
gonna get his ass kicked.

361
00:34:48,249 --> 00:34:52,420
But then a stranger intervenes
and... helps him out.

362
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,190
So the writer is driving home,
still a little shaken...

363
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:59,445
...and he sees this stranger
walking along the road, so, naturally...

364
00:34:59,545 --> 00:35:02,030
...he pulls over and gives the guy a lift.

365
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,499
The writer and the stranger start talking...

366
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:09,070
...and the writer offers the stranger
some work 'cause he feels sorry for him.

367
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:12,140
But even then, he's kinda concerned
'cause he doesn't know who this guy is.

368
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,475
I mean, he could be anybody.

369
00:35:14,575 --> 00:35:17,412
So by the time they get to the house...

370
00:35:17,512 --> 00:35:21,516
- ...the writer's already beginning to regret...
- No, no, no. It's not like this.

371
00:35:21,616 --> 00:35:23,151
Paul.

372
00:35:24,117 --> 00:35:25,920
It's just a story.

373
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,356
Yeah.

374
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,994
It's a good start. Go on.

375
00:35:33,094 --> 00:35:36,597
You're the writer, man. You write it.

376
00:35:36,697 --> 00:35:38,550
But you gotta be committed.

377
00:35:43,771 --> 00:35:45,540
Okay, sure, yeah.

378
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,520
When do you think you'll be done?

379
00:36:40,994 --> 00:36:43,198
Who said you could read the script?

380
00:36:43,698 --> 00:36:45,166
Why not?

381
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:48,202
Because I'm still working on it.
You can't read this.

382
00:36:48,302 --> 00:36:51,739
It's called a work in progress, you know?

383
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:54,009
That's not the problem.

384
00:36:55,009 --> 00:36:56,831
This story...

385
00:36:57,395 --> 00:37:00,152
...the way it happens, it's too easy.

386
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:03,527
Too easy? It's exactly what happened.

387
00:37:03,627 --> 00:37:05,185
Really?

388
00:37:05,685 --> 00:37:07,489
Are you sure about that?

389
00:37:08,905 --> 00:37:12,977
The Jack you write about, he's just some
guy standing at the counter of a diner.

390
00:37:13,661 --> 00:37:15,925
But what do we really know about him?

391
00:37:16,797 --> 00:37:18,667
What do we know?

392
00:37:19,067 --> 00:37:20,868
You know, maybe...

393
00:37:20,968 --> 00:37:24,574
...you know, maybe he was partnered up
with the truck driver who barged in.

394
00:37:27,574 --> 00:37:31,606
Maybe they worked it out in advance,
Jack and the truck driver.

395
00:37:32,446 --> 00:37:36,285
You know, they said, "when this guy
comes in, you start a fight with him.

396
00:37:37,435 --> 00:37:41,852
Then I'll come in, save his ass,
and he'll be eternally grateful."

397
00:37:42,323 --> 00:37:46,680
And later, in the parking lot,
what Jack whispers in his ear, is...

398
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:51,266
"thanks, buddy. Now he's mine."

399
00:37:52,266 --> 00:37:54,903
Then Jack takes off down the road.

400
00:37:55,383 --> 00:37:58,873
And then later the writer's driving home,
so what does he do?

401
00:37:59,473 --> 00:38:01,876
I mean, he wants to be a nice guy,
so he offers him work...

402
00:38:01,976 --> 00:38:06,014
So if... if Jack had some kind of...

403
00:38:06,604 --> 00:38:09,083
...relationship
with the truck driver, that...

404
00:38:09,183 --> 00:38:11,552
...that would be very interesting.

405
00:38:11,652 --> 00:38:14,696
- I mean... you're the writer, right?
- Yeah.

406
00:38:14,796 --> 00:38:18,169
Maybe the truck driver
should come back into the story...

407
00:38:18,269 --> 00:38:19,798
...towards the end.

408
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,854
I have a better ending in mind.

409
00:38:45,086 --> 00:38:47,556
Hard to speak a single word, isn't it?

410
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:53,228
That's where your script fails.

411
00:38:57,465 --> 00:38:59,515
That was the only way to show you.

412
00:39:04,137 --> 00:39:06,541
The woman on the run in your script...

413
00:39:06,941 --> 00:39:09,363
...she's about to have her throat slit.

414
00:39:09,463 --> 00:39:12,326
- What the fuck?
- And you have her pleading with him.

415
00:39:13,914 --> 00:39:16,400
If she reacted like you just did...

416
00:39:16,784 --> 00:39:19,047
...that would be realistic.

417
00:39:19,287 --> 00:39:21,561
I just wanted to show you some real.

418
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:25,593
Sorry for the scare.

419
00:41:59,847 --> 00:42:01,349
Jack!

420
00:42:18,865 --> 00:42:20,401
Jack!

421
00:42:42,121 --> 00:42:43,925
What's up?

422
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:46,093
Did you hear that scream?

423
00:42:46,193 --> 00:42:48,596
- Scream?
- Just now.

424
00:42:48,696 --> 00:42:51,599
- You didn't hear it?
- No.

425
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:54,085
It was a woman's scream.
I heard it from inside.

426
00:42:54,185 --> 00:42:56,070
You didn't hear it?

427
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:02,042
You mean that?

428
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:43,751
Nah.

429
00:43:58,131 --> 00:44:00,000
You expecting somebody?

430
00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:08,113
It's the grocery store.

431
00:44:08,213 --> 00:44:11,412
I got a standing order.
They deliver every week.

432
00:44:12,545 --> 00:44:15,216
Paul, not too far.

433
00:44:15,866 --> 00:44:17,765
What are you doing?

434
00:44:17,865 --> 00:44:20,489
He's a fucking delivery man. Put it down!

435
00:44:21,389 --> 00:44:23,257
- Hi.
- Oh, hey, Mr. Lopez.

436
00:44:23,357 --> 00:44:25,659
- Hank's not working today?
- No, not today.

437
00:44:25,759 --> 00:44:27,561
- Here's your delivery.
- Yeah.

438
00:44:27,661 --> 00:44:30,306
By the way, Mr. Lopez, Pat mentioned
you may have a check for him.

439
00:44:30,406 --> 00:44:33,501
I can't pay you today.
You know, and I told Pat that.

440
00:44:33,601 --> 00:44:36,136
Yeah, he also said
a postdated check would be fine.

441
00:44:36,236 --> 00:44:39,106
I don't have that for you today. I'm sorry.

442
00:44:39,206 --> 00:44:42,042
Well, I don't really wanna
get in trouble my first day.

443
00:44:42,142 --> 00:44:46,781
You won't. I know Pat a long time.
It's... you're gonna be fine, all right?

444
00:44:46,881 --> 00:44:50,194
Just leave it there... good. Thank you.

445
00:44:50,294 --> 00:44:53,053
- Okay, bye.
- All right. Okay, bye.

446
00:45:04,664 --> 00:45:06,167
Paul.

447
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,571
Where are you going?

448
00:45:10,371 --> 00:45:12,029
We had an agreement.

449
00:45:12,129 --> 00:45:14,133
- Now you're breaking it.
- An agreement?

450
00:45:14,233 --> 00:45:17,845
You had a gun on me, a gun, Jack!

451
00:45:17,945 --> 00:45:21,449
I don't know what your
fucking game is, not anymore.

452
00:45:29,922 --> 00:45:32,393
- Listen to me.
- No, you listen to me!

453
00:45:32,493 --> 00:45:36,446
You point a gun at me, just because
someone was at the door! Come on!

454
00:45:36,546 --> 00:45:39,637
I'm a little paranoid. So what?
Where you going, Paul?

455
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,569
Wherever the fuck I want to.

456
00:45:41,669 --> 00:45:44,839
What about the woman's scream?
I imagined that, right? I imagined that?

457
00:45:44,939 --> 00:45:48,207
You know, you're a real disappointment,
Paul. Any excuse, not to work?

458
00:45:48,307 --> 00:45:52,079
I invite you to my home,
and I'm a prisoner in my own house?

459
00:45:52,179 --> 00:45:53,647
Hey!

460
00:45:58,552 --> 00:46:00,721
Look at what you made me do, Paul.

461
00:46:09,314 --> 00:46:12,296
Don't make me hurt you. Do not!

462
00:46:13,766 --> 00:46:16,603
Don't make me hurt you.

463
00:46:17,822 --> 00:46:19,707
Don't make me hurt you.

464
00:46:22,841 --> 00:46:26,347
You know, I don't know what you're
talking about with that woman screaming.

465
00:46:26,447 --> 00:46:30,284
And, yeah, you bet
strangers make me nervous...

466
00:46:30,384 --> 00:46:34,016
...as you would be,
if you'd just got out of prison.

467
00:46:38,424 --> 00:46:41,094
They're looking for you, aren't they?

468
00:46:41,194 --> 00:46:44,932
Doesn't matter. I ain't never going back.

469
00:46:51,037 --> 00:46:54,842
Get some rest, Paul.
Got a lot of work to do tomorrow.

470
00:47:39,387 --> 00:47:40,954
Shit.

471
00:47:47,994 --> 00:47:52,533
Now, in the movies, you grab two wires
from under the steering column...

472
00:47:52,633 --> 00:47:55,435
...touch 'em together, engine starts, right?

473
00:47:55,535 --> 00:47:58,745
- Right.
- What's in the bag, Paul?

474
00:48:00,273 --> 00:48:03,278
- We had an agreement.
- What do you want me to say?

475
00:48:05,812 --> 00:48:09,283
All right. I... I was going to drink.

476
00:48:09,383 --> 00:48:10,951
Alone.

477
00:48:11,818 --> 00:48:13,878
That's why you're stuck, Paul.

478
00:48:15,988 --> 00:48:18,192
Come on. Come with me.

479
00:48:18,792 --> 00:48:20,594
Come on!

480
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,029
Grab your bag.

481
00:48:28,635 --> 00:48:30,871
Take the booze out of the bag.

482
00:48:38,811 --> 00:48:41,282
You don't have to be afraid of me, Paul.

483
00:48:42,082 --> 00:48:43,884
I'm here to help you.

484
00:48:48,687 --> 00:48:51,795
Now, I want you to smash it
against that wall over there.

485
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:53,711
Smash it.

486
00:49:26,092 --> 00:49:28,583
Come on. Get back to work.

487
00:50:00,426 --> 00:50:04,500
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.

488
00:50:05,331 --> 00:50:07,167
Fuck me.

489
00:50:36,129 --> 00:50:39,165
- Laura.
- I've been calling you for days.

490
00:50:39,465 --> 00:50:43,182
I'm confused. I mean, maybe you don't want
me to be your real estate agent anymore...

491
00:50:43,282 --> 00:50:45,696
...but you asked me out.

492
00:50:45,796 --> 00:50:48,367
It was date, right?
I mean, maybe I got that wrong...

493
00:50:48,467 --> 00:50:51,234
- Get in your car and leave right now.
- What happened to your face? Why?

494
00:50:51,334 --> 00:50:53,910
- There's no time. There's someone else here.
- What's going on? Who?

495
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:56,701
Give me the keys. Trust me. Get in.

496
00:50:58,017 --> 00:51:01,088
- What's going on?
- I'll explain to you later, I'm sorry.

497
00:51:01,188 --> 00:51:04,844
Tell me later? Paul, what is going on?
You have to tell me.

498
00:51:04,944 --> 00:51:08,028
- Where are you going?
- I'll explain later!

499
00:51:28,982 --> 00:51:31,398
Out! Out!

500
00:51:31,498 --> 00:51:34,108
- Do what he says. Do what he says.
- Move!

501
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:36,623
- Now you, Paul, take the keys out!
- Jack, calm down, calm down!

502
00:51:36,723 --> 00:51:39,192
Get out! Move!

503
00:51:39,492 --> 00:51:42,262
- You, go!
- Jack, calm down. Calm down, please.

504
00:51:42,362 --> 00:51:46,066
Take off the hand brake, and start
pushing the car into the pond.

505
00:51:46,166 --> 00:51:48,202
You, help him!

506
00:51:48,402 --> 00:51:49,903
Move!

507
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:56,142
Move! Faster! Faster!

508
00:52:01,647 --> 00:52:04,395
Now move. Get up to the house.

509
00:52:29,976 --> 00:52:31,778
I'll get it.

510
00:52:41,788 --> 00:52:43,323
Marion?

511
00:52:44,257 --> 00:52:46,127
She's the babysitter.

512
00:52:47,227 --> 00:52:51,631
Please, let me go.
I have a baby, please, let me...

513
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:55,669
Please.

514
00:52:58,772 --> 00:53:03,052
You see how disorientated people get
when their future is uncertain?

515
00:53:05,478 --> 00:53:08,100
They always tend to imagine the worst.

516
00:53:09,016 --> 00:53:10,884
You too, Paul.

517
00:53:11,417 --> 00:53:13,687
You always imagine the worst.

518
00:53:19,722 --> 00:53:21,782
What's the sheriff doing here?

519
00:53:21,882 --> 00:53:23,797
No idea.

520
00:53:23,897 --> 00:53:25,699
Come on.

521
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:28,434
Come on.

522
00:53:32,104 --> 00:53:34,508
You're both smart enough
not to try anything, right?

523
00:53:34,608 --> 00:53:36,176
Right.

524
00:53:39,111 --> 00:53:40,614
Paul.

525
00:53:44,918 --> 00:53:46,186
- Hey.
- Hey.

526
00:53:46,286 --> 00:53:48,933
Deputy Carcano. How can I help you?

527
00:53:49,356 --> 00:53:52,159
You shouldn't leave your tools out
in this weather, they'll get rusty.

528
00:53:52,259 --> 00:53:54,561
Yeah. I'll get around to it.

529
00:53:54,661 --> 00:53:58,298
- You know, it's been busy.
- Listen, we're looking for this woman.

530
00:53:58,398 --> 00:54:01,589
I was wondering if by any chance
you've seen her? Michelle Emerson?

531
00:54:04,132 --> 00:54:06,387
No, no, no, I'm sorry.

532
00:54:07,207 --> 00:54:11,211
- You know, I haven't.
- She works for the post office.

533
00:54:11,511 --> 00:54:15,352
According to the tracking log, she was
due to deliver a package earlier today...

534
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:17,268
...from Los Angeles.

535
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:19,686
- Here?
- Yeah.

536
00:54:20,124 --> 00:54:24,391
Hold on, hold on, hold on. I was expecting
something from my agent, yeah.

537
00:54:24,491 --> 00:54:29,176
But I never got it, and I didn't see
this woman, that's for sure.

538
00:54:30,764 --> 00:54:34,600
Do you have a mailbox elsewhere on
the property? Perhaps she left it there.

539
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:39,006
No, no, no. Everything I get is
dropped off here at the house, yeah.

540
00:54:39,106 --> 00:54:41,188
Right, right.

541
00:54:41,623 --> 00:54:43,944
Well, listen, thanks for your time.

542
00:54:44,044 --> 00:54:46,146
If you see something...

543
00:54:46,246 --> 00:54:49,516
- ...you know where to find me.
- Carcano!

544
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,945
Get down!

545
00:54:55,355 --> 00:54:57,557
- Get up! Get up!
- Okay, alright!

546
00:54:57,657 --> 00:54:59,847
- Come here. Come here, come here.
- Get in the trunk!

547
00:54:59,947 --> 00:55:03,284
- Get that window, that window!
- Get in! Move, move!

548
00:55:03,964 --> 00:55:06,900
- Shit. Bolt it, bolt it!
- What?

549
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,268
- Shit!
- Stay right there!

550
00:55:08,368 --> 00:55:10,907
Who's shooting? He shot the cop?

551
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:13,273
- That's very good, Paul!
- Paul!

552
00:55:13,373 --> 00:55:15,843
You're finally starting to show
some fucking imagination!

553
00:55:15,943 --> 00:55:18,405
He needs us alive,
just in case the cops come back.

554
00:55:18,505 --> 00:55:20,377
I got a great fucking imagination, too!

555
00:55:20,477 --> 00:55:23,317
He's gonna kill us. He's gonna kill us.

556
00:55:26,353 --> 00:55:28,187
Come on!

557
00:55:28,287 --> 00:55:29,723
Come here.

558
00:55:29,823 --> 00:55:31,624
Jesus Christ.

559
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:39,266
He just killed a cop.

560
00:55:41,033 --> 00:55:43,871
- He just killed a fucking cop!
- Laura, please!

561
00:55:43,971 --> 00:55:45,939
Stop it!

562
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:48,842
It's about thinking now, all right?

563
00:56:12,665 --> 00:56:14,668
How old is your kid?

564
00:56:18,937 --> 00:56:20,440
Two.

565
00:56:21,307 --> 00:56:22,842
Two.

566
00:56:25,277 --> 00:56:27,348
I can't think about that right now.

567
00:56:28,148 --> 00:56:30,584
We're gonna... hey, listen.

568
00:56:31,484 --> 00:56:33,553
We're going to get out of here.

569
00:56:34,188 --> 00:56:37,657
- We can't just sit here.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

570
00:56:38,857 --> 00:56:40,727
You hear that?

571
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:42,596
What?

572
00:56:42,996 --> 00:56:45,565
Yeah, there is a railroad
two miles from here.

573
00:56:45,665 --> 00:56:47,935
A train goes by every half an hour.

574
00:56:53,372 --> 00:56:56,209
- He's on the roof.
- What's he doing?

575
00:57:06,869 --> 00:57:08,438
What's he doing?

576
00:57:24,536 --> 00:57:26,773
This is our chance.
This is our chance, we gotta go.

577
00:57:26,873 --> 00:57:29,543
We gotta go, we gotta go. Go, go.

578
00:57:29,943 --> 00:57:32,441
- You have to run as fast as you can.
- Okay.

579
00:57:32,541 --> 00:57:34,981
Straight to the forest,
straight for the train...

580
00:57:35,081 --> 00:57:39,250
...and don't look back, all right? Now,
go, go, go, go, go. Come on, come on!

581
00:57:48,027 --> 00:57:49,829
Come on!

582
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:55,875
Come on! The train is over this hill!
Come on!

583
00:58:02,141 --> 00:58:03,977
Come on!

584
00:58:06,311 --> 00:58:08,114
Come on.

585
00:58:18,491 --> 00:58:21,560
- I can't, my ankle.
- Oh, yes, you can.

586
00:58:22,829 --> 00:58:25,264
We're almost there, almost there.

587
00:58:27,701 --> 00:58:30,305
Are we finished playing fucking games, Paul?

588
00:58:32,505 --> 00:58:34,507
Get back to the fucking house!

589
00:58:34,607 --> 00:58:36,409
Come on, Laura.

590
00:59:00,432 --> 00:59:02,301
You okay?

591
00:59:06,672 --> 00:59:08,508
Where... where is he?

592
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:11,849
Downstairs, I think.

593
00:59:19,518 --> 00:59:21,417
Why is he here?

594
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:25,729
I picked him up on my way back here.

595
00:59:27,861 --> 00:59:29,697
Come downstairs.

596
00:59:37,135 --> 00:59:39,247
I'm not going down there.

597
00:59:59,425 --> 01:00:01,020
Not there.

598
01:00:02,611 --> 01:00:04,180
There.

599
01:00:25,635 --> 01:00:27,704
You've been disloyal, Paul.

600
01:00:28,654 --> 01:00:31,073
You forgot all about our agreement.

601
01:00:32,292 --> 01:00:34,131
Our agreement?

602
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:42,065
You're completely out of your mind.
You know that, right?

603
01:00:42,165 --> 01:00:45,489
You just killed the fucking sheriff,
and you're talking about the agreement?

604
01:00:46,139 --> 01:00:48,908
You have been here three days.

605
01:00:49,108 --> 01:00:52,526
First you put a knife to my throat,
then a gun to my head.

606
01:00:53,246 --> 01:00:58,206
And maybe I am crazy, too,
because why I didn't toss you out...

607
01:00:58,306 --> 01:01:00,954
...day one, is baffling to me.

608
01:01:11,864 --> 01:01:14,122
You still don't get it, do you, Paul?

609
01:01:15,818 --> 01:01:18,032
I'm the one writing the story.

610
01:01:18,802 --> 01:01:22,751
I mean, I gave you your chance
until you had that brilliant idea...

611
01:01:22,851 --> 01:01:24,671
...to open the door.

612
01:01:24,771 --> 01:01:26,679
It's your fault the sheriff's dead.

613
01:01:26,779 --> 01:01:30,695
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I didn't kill anybody. You did! You did!

614
01:01:30,795 --> 01:01:35,456
This is fucking insane!
Why are you still sitting here?

615
01:01:36,456 --> 01:01:40,893
They're gonna storm this place,
and you are definitely going back to prison.

616
01:01:40,993 --> 01:01:44,177
Now, how is that for an ending, Jack?

617
01:01:47,834 --> 01:01:49,636
You know...

618
01:01:51,637 --> 01:01:53,907
...none of that happens unless I say so.

619
01:01:56,409 --> 01:02:00,362
And if I do decide
to let them in and kill me...

620
01:02:04,116 --> 01:02:05,952
...you get to write the story.

621
01:02:11,723 --> 01:02:13,224
You have to let her go.

622
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,098
What the fuck is her name?

623
01:02:19,198 --> 01:02:22,035
- Laura.
- Thank you. Laura!

624
01:02:31,643 --> 01:02:36,086
How does it feel to see a real murder,
not just one in the movies?

625
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,855
You stab someone, you slit their throat, they
fall to the ground in seconds. Done, dead.

626
01:02:41,955 --> 01:02:44,457
Well, you know, I'm not interested.
You're a sick person.

627
01:02:44,557 --> 01:02:46,425
You make your life...

628
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:49,017
Hey, let her go!

629
01:02:50,897 --> 01:02:54,244
- Stay right there.
- You don't have the guts. Shoot!

630
01:02:55,435 --> 01:02:57,556
No, stop!

631
01:03:14,787 --> 01:03:16,355
Jack!

632
01:03:20,459 --> 01:03:24,263
What the fuck? You let her go, Jack! Come on!

633
01:03:29,752 --> 01:03:31,621
Where is she?

634
01:03:33,071 --> 01:03:34,941
What did you do to her?

635
01:03:38,076 --> 01:03:39,879
What did you... fucker.

636
01:03:58,664 --> 01:04:00,734
Which actor should play me?

637
01:04:02,901 --> 01:04:04,637
A fucking maniac.

638
01:04:04,737 --> 01:04:08,741
You know, you'd have killed me
without a second thought.

639
01:04:10,776 --> 01:04:14,080
- I like that.
- Why are there scalpels in your bag?

640
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:15,709
The trinkets?

641
01:04:15,909 --> 01:04:18,521
The journal? Is that what it is?

642
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:21,861
What does it mean, Jack?

643
01:04:22,155 --> 01:04:24,357
It means you have no manners.

644
01:04:25,057 --> 01:04:27,330
Going through a guest's belongings.

645
01:04:28,728 --> 01:04:30,764
Nothing worse than betrayal.

646
01:04:33,699 --> 01:04:35,969
I'm gonna finish our story, Paul.

647
01:04:36,669 --> 01:04:38,837
You're not capable of it.

648
01:07:51,496 --> 01:07:54,136
You finally found some imagination.

649
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:56,402
What did you do, Jack?

650
01:07:58,636 --> 01:08:00,589
Where is your knife?

651
01:08:02,441 --> 01:08:04,023
Throw it over there.

652
01:08:08,914 --> 01:08:10,864
It's okay.

653
01:08:10,964 --> 01:08:12,812
Nobody knows she's here.

654
01:08:13,252 --> 01:08:16,386
We'll get rid of the body,
it'll be like nothing ever happened.

655
01:08:16,486 --> 01:08:18,373
Come on. We got some work to do.

656
01:08:18,473 --> 01:08:21,277
- Let's put an end to this...
- Stay right there!

657
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:25,732
- This is gonna end the way I want.
- There's only one way this'll end, Paul.

658
01:08:26,632 --> 01:08:29,560
We clean this shit up before the cops
come here and find out what we did.

659
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:33,372
We didn't do anything. You did! Alone!

660
01:08:33,472 --> 01:08:36,339
- And I need the police to find that out.
- You need the police?

661
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:41,326
Yes, I do. I can recognize a sign from
providence when I come across one...

662
01:08:41,426 --> 01:08:43,995
...because I have received so few.

663
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:46,519
Oy, come over here.

664
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:51,674
Hands on your head, get on the ground.

665
01:08:57,542 --> 01:09:00,162
I am grateful to you, Jack.

666
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:03,803
I know it doesn't look like that
right now, but I am.

667
01:09:03,903 --> 01:09:05,738
And you know why?

668
01:09:06,388 --> 01:09:09,266
Because you have been sent by God.

669
01:09:10,309 --> 01:09:14,413
A drifter, barely a step ahead of the cops...

670
01:09:14,513 --> 01:09:18,748
...running and killing these women,
so vulnerable...

671
01:09:18,848 --> 01:09:22,221
...stolen away and butchered
somewhere in the dark of the woods.

672
01:09:22,321 --> 01:09:26,824
But chance has made me the one to stop you.

673
01:09:26,924 --> 01:09:30,530
- I didn't kill these women.
- You don't have to convince me.

674
01:09:44,742 --> 01:09:47,796
You know why I have never been caught?

675
01:09:55,887 --> 01:09:59,692
When providence signals to me...

676
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:04,728
...I recognize it instantly.

677
01:10:06,131 --> 01:10:11,561
A woman alone in her car waiting
for her boyfriend to get out of work.

678
01:10:12,461 --> 01:10:14,340
He's late.

679
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:18,345
She rolls down her window
to have a cigarette.

680
01:10:18,845 --> 01:10:21,248
Her hand hangs outside.

681
01:10:22,348 --> 01:10:25,766
Adjusts the rear-view mirror and...

682
01:10:25,866 --> 01:10:29,155
...and it feels so clear.

683
01:10:30,522 --> 01:10:32,433
Or a housewife...

684
01:10:32,533 --> 01:10:35,749
...out in the woods apart from her family...

685
01:10:35,849 --> 01:10:37,863
...just long enough.

686
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:41,467
Just long enough for me to know...

687
01:10:41,847 --> 01:10:43,732
...that Providence...

688
01:10:43,832 --> 01:10:47,679
...is smiling at me, this very moment!

689
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:51,710
But...

690
01:10:56,681 --> 01:10:58,484
...you have to be...

691
01:10:59,651 --> 01:11:01,654
...able to embrace it.

692
01:11:02,854 --> 01:11:04,952
The drifter on the side of the road.

693
01:11:06,492 --> 01:11:10,296
Don't let him walk away. Pick him up.

694
01:11:10,396 --> 01:11:12,431
Dress him for the part.

695
01:11:16,592 --> 01:11:21,039
I have to say you really made me earn this.

696
01:11:23,139 --> 01:11:24,644
Yeah.

697
01:11:24,944 --> 01:11:27,936
You think you know more
than me about reality?

698
01:11:29,281 --> 01:11:30,640
I'm only a writer, right?

699
01:11:35,253 --> 01:11:37,324
I'm gonna show you reality.

700
01:11:38,424 --> 01:11:42,094
You build it. Now stand up.

701
01:11:43,795 --> 01:11:45,464
Stand up!

702
01:11:52,570 --> 01:11:54,440
All right, Jack.

703
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:56,609
This is how the story ends.

704
01:12:53,597 --> 01:12:55,425
Go to zone two.

705
01:12:55,625 --> 01:12:57,118
Yeah.

706
01:12:57,903 --> 01:12:59,738
Cover your ears.

707
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,822
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

708
01:13:16,922 --> 01:13:19,558
- He's mine.
- Okay, go get him.

709
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:40,380
I'll take care of it.
I'll tell them you had guests.

710
01:13:47,018 --> 01:13:48,894
Where's the K-9 unit?

711
01:13:53,658 --> 01:13:55,461
Over here?

712
01:14:13,978 --> 01:14:17,052
Well, I got a great fucking imagination, too!

713
01:14:20,618 --> 01:14:22,455
He's on the roof.

714
01:14:39,737 --> 01:14:43,975
This is our chance. This is our chance.
We gotta go, we gotta go, we gotta go.

715
01:15:06,097 --> 01:15:08,134
Did you check the prints?

716
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:24,416
- Hey, boss.
- Good job.

717
01:15:24,516 --> 01:15:26,118
Thanks.

718
01:15:35,293 --> 01:15:36,829
Hey.

719
01:15:40,031 --> 01:15:41,834
How you holding up?

720
01:15:42,534 --> 01:15:44,147
Good.

721
01:15:44,247 --> 01:15:46,066
You good?

722
01:15:46,537 --> 01:15:48,074
Yeah.

723
01:15:48,774 --> 01:15:52,210
I'm proud of you. You hung right in there.

724
01:15:52,310 --> 01:15:56,717
Look, Jack, he's a little crazy,
but he's my guy.

725
01:16:14,166 --> 01:16:17,002
Okay, guys, clear out.

726
01:16:37,822 --> 01:16:39,357
Here.

727
01:16:39,957 --> 01:16:42,179
Make the most of it.

728
01:16:43,028 --> 01:16:45,099
It's gonna be your last for a while.

729
01:16:47,665 --> 01:16:50,296
We've been tracking you down for three years.

730
01:16:51,036 --> 01:16:54,006
Never found a crime scene
until it was too late.

731
01:16:54,106 --> 01:16:55,941
And even then...

732
01:16:58,109 --> 01:16:59,945
...you left us nothing.

733
01:17:01,829 --> 01:17:03,249
Until now.

734
01:17:15,693 --> 01:17:17,925
We're out in the open here, Paul.

735
01:17:18,497 --> 01:17:20,332
No more secrets.

736
01:17:25,803 --> 01:17:27,807
Perhaps you'll remember this.

737
01:17:28,607 --> 01:17:32,244
Know why I have never been caught?

738
01:17:32,344 --> 01:17:36,248
When providence signals to me...

739
01:17:36,548 --> 01:17:39,385
...I recognize it instantly.

740
01:17:40,685 --> 01:17:45,270
A woman alone in her car waiting
for her boyfriend to get out work.

741
01:17:47,959 --> 01:17:51,964
I hate myself for not catching you
before you got to Nancy Barrows.

742
01:17:52,714 --> 01:17:54,784
I'll carry that to my grave.

743
01:17:57,868 --> 01:17:59,832
Four victims.

744
01:18:00,572 --> 01:18:04,983
Now, we found all the bodies, all except one.

745
01:18:05,644 --> 01:18:07,413
The first...

746
01:18:07,513 --> 01:18:10,715
...your wife, Renee.

747
01:18:14,118 --> 01:18:16,188
Tell me where you buried her.

748
01:18:18,389 --> 01:18:20,258
How can I?

749
01:18:21,325 --> 01:18:23,395
I haven't seen her...

750
01:18:24,795 --> 01:18:26,799
...since she left me.

751
01:18:31,969 --> 01:18:36,237
Come on, buddy.
Tell me where you buried your wife.

752
01:18:36,975 --> 01:18:40,979
The jury will see it
as a gesture of goodwill.

753
01:18:41,079 --> 01:18:43,731
It'll help you when you come to sentencing.

754
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,587
Give Renee's family some closure.

755
01:18:48,487 --> 01:18:50,489
They deserve it, don't you think?

756
01:18:50,589 --> 01:18:52,860
I don't know what you're talking about...

757
01:18:54,026 --> 01:18:55,894
...whoever you are.

758
01:18:57,194 --> 01:18:58,697
Okay.

759
01:19:03,367 --> 01:19:06,206
We're gonna convict you
of every murder you've ever done.

760
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,509
You're going to convict me?

761
01:19:13,694 --> 01:19:15,530
With what?

762
01:19:17,515 --> 01:19:20,211
Everything you have in that bag is tainted.

763
01:19:21,019 --> 01:19:22,554
Planted.

764
01:19:24,755 --> 01:19:26,258
You're...

765
01:19:26,558 --> 01:19:30,795
...so in need of a scapegoat
that it's pathetic.

766
01:19:32,005 --> 01:19:34,014
You come To my house...

767
01:19:34,114 --> 01:19:36,629
...with a bag of evidence
you collected from the bodies.

768
01:19:36,729 --> 01:19:40,373
Bodies you had access to,
and trying to hang it on me?

769
01:19:42,373 --> 01:19:44,209
The tape?

770
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:47,933
Do you think that's my confession?

771
01:19:49,047 --> 01:19:52,682
I was thinking my screenplay aloud. So what?

772
01:19:53,651 --> 01:19:55,654
It was dialogue for a character.

773
01:19:56,154 --> 01:19:58,799
Method writing, if you wanna call it that.

774
01:20:01,025 --> 01:20:04,576
Isn't that what we were doing...

775
01:20:04,796 --> 01:20:08,684
...you and I, when you held
a knife to my throat?

776
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:11,837
If you are so fucking sure of yourself...

777
01:20:11,937 --> 01:20:15,774
...why harass me for my wife's body?

778
01:20:16,274 --> 01:20:20,771
You had me at gunpoint!
I was a hostage in my own house!

779
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:25,917
Where did you think you're going
with this harebrained scam?

780
01:20:27,184 --> 01:20:29,622
Are you guys completely insane?

781
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:36,230
Is that the way you're gonna play it, Paul?

782
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:41,166
Okay.

783
01:20:43,167 --> 01:20:45,695
An innocent man would have
just said, "I didn't do it."

784
01:21:04,388 --> 01:21:08,406
- Hey, there, Deputy Carcano.
- Dive team says there's nothing in the pond.

785
01:21:09,077 --> 01:21:10,946
Nothing from K-9 unit.

786
01:21:12,062 --> 01:21:13,647
Fuck.

787
01:21:14,299 --> 01:21:16,168
Have them keep looking.

788
01:21:25,009 --> 01:21:26,845
Doesn't look good.

789
01:21:27,245 --> 01:21:30,753
Got physical evidence
that he's gonna say you planted.

790
01:21:30,853 --> 01:21:33,985
We got him on tape, and I don't know
how you get into this storytelling thing...

791
01:21:34,085 --> 01:21:36,388
...but he's gonna say
that's what he was doing there...

792
01:21:36,488 --> 01:21:38,790
...and that creates plausible deniability.

793
01:21:38,890 --> 01:21:42,694
- His word against mine?
- Well, you don't have to convince me, Jack.

794
01:21:43,144 --> 01:21:47,566
Look, you've worked too hard
on this one for it to not go our way.

795
01:21:48,166 --> 01:21:52,008
I don't think I have to tell you,
without a confession, we're fucked.

796
01:21:52,938 --> 01:21:54,686
Fuck.

797
01:22:16,227 --> 01:22:17,829
- Jack.
- Yeah.

798
01:22:17,929 --> 01:22:20,731
The boss is gonna book him.
They want you inside.

799
01:22:21,266 --> 01:22:23,135
All right.

800
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:01,573
Look at this photograph.

801
01:23:05,910 --> 01:23:08,950
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

802
01:23:32,937 --> 01:23:34,939
Better times, huh?

803
01:23:40,311 --> 01:23:42,114
Your beautiful wife...

804
01:23:43,530 --> 01:23:45,811
...outside of your rustic retreat.

805
01:23:47,785 --> 01:23:49,388
But something's missing.

806
01:23:56,894 --> 01:23:58,547
Tell me something, Paul.

807
01:24:00,194 --> 01:24:02,534
If I was to dig underneath your pond...

808
01:24:02,634 --> 01:24:05,471
...I mean, really underneath your pond...

809
01:24:06,737 --> 01:24:08,940
...would I find your wife?

810
01:24:17,314 --> 01:24:19,117
All right, Jack.

811
01:24:19,717 --> 01:24:23,723
Your odds in court went up, no question.

812
01:24:30,995 --> 01:24:34,800
Can I talk to you, just you and me?

813
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:37,620
Clear the room, guys.

814
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:40,305
Let's go.

815
01:24:43,001 --> 01:24:44,876
I'm all ears.

816
01:24:48,045 --> 01:24:50,282
You have no idea...

817
01:24:51,415 --> 01:24:53,532
...the pain I'm holding inside.

818
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:56,922
Just don't! Listen to me. Hear me out.

819
01:25:00,457 --> 01:25:03,861
This is an idea for a... for a deal.

820
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:08,233
Full confession.

821
01:25:10,167 --> 01:25:12,570
I'll give you every detail...

822
01:25:14,171 --> 01:25:15,732
...of...

823
01:25:16,451 --> 01:25:18,753
...every one of the victims' remains...

824
01:25:18,853 --> 01:25:22,347
...for every crime scene, everything.

825
01:25:22,447 --> 01:25:24,517
I have a great memory.

826
01:25:25,817 --> 01:25:29,421
I wrap up your case neatly with a bright bow.

827
01:25:31,852 --> 01:25:33,491
But no needle.

828
01:25:35,559 --> 01:25:39,845
Lock me up in a mental institution,
whatever, but no needle.

829
01:25:41,283 --> 01:25:44,553
I deserve to live with this pain.

830
01:25:54,778 --> 01:25:56,779
You had your chance with me.

831
01:25:57,849 --> 01:26:01,286
- I'm done.
- No, listen to me! You owe this to me.

832
01:26:03,087 --> 01:26:05,790
It was up to me to pick you up on the road.

833
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:09,361
My decision, my idea, it was always my story.

834
01:26:10,261 --> 01:26:14,902
Was it real enough for you? It seems
like it was. I gave you all of this!

835
01:26:17,534 --> 01:26:19,771
But you owe me my ending.

836
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:32,417
I like my ending better.

837
01:26:33,305 --> 01:27:33,448
