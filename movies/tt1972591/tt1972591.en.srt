2
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:53,550
Uther, I don't think
we can win this fight.

3
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:55,885
I know Mordred. He would accept surrender.

4
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:57,053
Hold the crown.

5
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:00,557
And hold it steady.

6
00:03:56,112 --> 00:03:58,156
Drink their blood!

7
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,661
War!

8
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:09,287
<i>Let us not forget
that before Mordred,</i>

9
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:12,623
<i>the Mages lived among us in harmony.</i>

10
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,002
Our relationship with them
was always peaceful.

11
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:19,839
That was before they tasted power,
and produced those creatures of war.

12
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:22,800
<i>But it was only Mordred,
not his people.</i>

13
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:25,178
<i>So why are
we slaughtering them, Vortigern?</i>

14
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:27,504
Was not the Prince friendly
with the Mages at one time?

15
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,265
Did he not study with Mordred himself?

16
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:30,725
What are you implying?

17
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:34,145
I was sent to study with him by my father

18
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:35,772
<i>as a token of diplomacy.</i>

19
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,691
<i>We would only seek
to remind Your Majesty</i>

20
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:42,070
that it was a Mage, Merlin,
who gave you the great sword.

21
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,571
Light!

22
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:46,741
<i>Where would we be without Merlin
and the Mages who helped him?</i>

23
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:49,994
Where are they now?
Why do they not show themselves?

24
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:52,288
You know where they are, Lord Mercia.

25
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:54,499
- They are running for their lives!
- Enough!

26
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:55,666
Loose!

27
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,002
<i>There will be no more killings.</i>

28
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:01,172
There will be no more purges.
Am I clear, brother?

29
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:06,135
Now leave me.

30
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:17,438
Peace?

31
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,364
For a while.

32
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:30,910
Have we arrived in time
to save you from each other?

33
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:33,871
The only person
I need saving from is you.

34
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:36,290
I came for the child, not you.

35
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,376
Then you'll have to
fight me for him.

36
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:40,294
My brother's not himself today.

37
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:41,546
<i>Look after him.</i>

38
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:43,047
I'll see you tomorrow.

39
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:11,742
Are the men ready?

40
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,244
Yes, they are.

41
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:18,249
Are you sure about this, my Lord?

42
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:28,718
Listen to me, woman.
I need you to do as I tell you.

43
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:29,927
What's going on?

44
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:32,263
<i>I need to get you and the boy
away from here.</i>

45
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,098
<i>And I'll join you as soon as I can.</i>

46
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:35,433
<i>I'm scared, Uther.</i>

47
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,269
<i>I have the sword. Hurry.</i>

48
00:08:39,896 --> 00:08:41,981
How do you know of this place, my love?

49
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,401
You must tell me where we're going.

50
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:48,988
Why do you not answer me?

51
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,043
Tell me what we're doing down here.

52
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:14,555
My darling, tell me what it is.

53
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,038
Tell me what it is,
and I'll make it stop.

54
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:30,446
It's okay.

55
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:17,952
Untie the skiff.

56
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,198
King Vortigern!

57
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:05,286
Move!

58
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:09,331
Hey!

59
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:32,938
Come here!

60
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,266
Come on! Come on!

61
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:46,971
<i>Run, son!</i>

62
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:58,375
Step aside for the king.

63
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:26,654
Get them back to work.

64
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,821
Sire.

65
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:32,785
Sergeant! Get them under manners!

66
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:23,293
Still so handsome, my king.

67
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,462
Why has the water dropped?

68
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,632
Why does the sword reveal itself now?

69
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:32,302
<i>I'm not ready, the tower is not complete.</i>

70
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,683
As your power increases, so, too,
do the forces that will oppose you.

71
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:42,020
Balance is a law
that cannot be transgressed.

72
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:45,149
The born king will come.

73
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,985
It is inevitable.

74
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:50,738
We had a deal.

75
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,157
When the blood of a loved one
is spilt in these waters,

76
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,326
my desire must be met.

77
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:59,163
<i>There is no ambiguity, my Lord.</i>

78
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:01,582
We kept our side of the covenant.

79
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:04,877
It was you who lost the boy,
and the sword.

80
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,503
Have I not sacrificed enough?

81
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:09,006
And have you not felt your power increase?

82
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:12,593
With every kingdom conquered,
with every level added to your tower.

83
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,554
When it is capped
with the silver from Gaul,

84
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:17,973
you will have what you wanted.

85
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,186
<i>Find the boy.</i>

86
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:23,353
<i>Kill him.</i>

87
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:26,607
<i>And the sword will answer only to you.</i>

88
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,985
If you desire further help,

89
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,362
you know the price.

90
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,953
Bumped into
the Vikings this morning.

91
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:42,623
They insisted I give you this

92
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:46,251
with their deepest apologies.

93
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:51,548
Get yourself well.

94
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,315
This wasn't your responsibility, Arthur.

95
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:54,551
Don't be silly.

96
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:58,055
You girls have looked after me for
a lot longer than I've looked after you.

97
00:18:58,555 --> 00:18:59,848
I owe you everything.

98
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:03,435
What's so funny?

99
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:06,063
I just wanna know
how you get money out of Vikings.

100
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:09,358
You ask them for it.

101
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:13,028
<i>- Open the door!
- Hey.</i>

102
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,447
<i>Open in the name of the king!</i>

103
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:16,698
Open it.

104
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:19,868
Yes, gentlemen?

105
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,913
A turner come down this way.
We're searching all houses.

106
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,499
Whoa. Slow down, new boy,
before you trip up.

107
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,834
What did you say?

108
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,419
I'm gonna take your hands for that.

109
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,004
Sergeant!

110
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,342
What did I tell you
about this establishment?

111
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:36,802
He touched me, sir.

112
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,929
Well, you should count yourself lucky.

113
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:41,223
Most people have to pay for that.

114
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,309
Now take your terriers and get out!

115
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:49,815
Jack's Eye.

116
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:52,109
What did he want in here?

117
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:55,279
Resistance are on the move again.

118
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,531
Hit a branding barge upriver.

119
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:01,159
Anyone in the house you don't know?

120
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:05,372
Well, I'm not sure, Jack.
People come and go.

121
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,624
But we don't fall that side.

122
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,543
Ah, well, that's as may be.

123
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,130
Well, they fall where they fall.

124
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:16,341
This "born king" bollocks isn't good
for anyone.

125
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:17,885
Mind if I take a look?

126
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:21,638
He's bleeding.

127
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,892
Took an arrow on the way out.

128
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:29,897
What would happen to a man
who hits the king's barge upriver?

129
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,523
<i>Well, you know what would happen.</i>

130
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,819
And it doesn't happen quickly.

131
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,572
What would happen to the people
harboring such a man?

132
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:41,199
Well, they get treated the same
as the man they hide.

133
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:42,826
Would they, now?

134
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:47,915
Not sure you're too welcome here, mate.

135
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:01,511
You're in safe hands now,
no need to worry.

136
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,182
In the back room, now.

137
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:08,101
What's this all about, Jack?
What's it got to do with us?

138
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,437
Do you have any idea who that man is?

139
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:12,856
For a man who's so popular,
I'm surprised I don't.

140
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:14,358
Goosefat Bill.

141
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,234
I know who he is. He got that moniker

142
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:19,172
'cause he keeps slipping out
from the bars you keep putting him behind.

143
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:21,716
He was found in this establishment,
and that doesn't look good for you.

144
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,783
What's going on?

145
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,368
What's going on where?

146
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:27,079
You've got some heat on you, Arthur.
Your name keeps coming up.

147
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:28,372
In what circles?

148
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:30,248
My mum's sewing circle.

149
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:33,877
I'm a Blackleg sergeant, stupid.
What circles do you think?

150
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,381
Now, tell me a story
about a girl called Lucy,

151
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:38,882
<i>a Viking called Greybeard,</i>

152
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:41,468
<i>and some rebel graffiti
dirtying these walls.</i>

153
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:42,928
Are you writing a book?

154
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,596
Tell me. Every detail.

155
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,976
We had a quiet word
with a couple of Vikings.

156
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,395
Get back! Back!

157
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,940
I said from the beginning,
the very beginning.

158
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:56,149
I woke up.

159
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,068
Then?

160
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,611
Well, then I got dressed.

161
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:01,858
<i>I went downstairs, I saw the girls.
Lucy was missing.</i>

162
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:03,073
Where's Lucy?

163
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,033
- She's a good girl.
- A nice girl.

164
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,410
- She works here.
- Then?

165
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,453
<i>Then me and the lads</i>

166
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:09,997
<i>took care of a bit of business.</i>

167
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,164
<i>Bit of housekeeping.</i>

168
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:12,411
Everything as it should be?

169
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,001
That's the spoil from the boats.

170
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,168
- Then?
- Then we heard...

171
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,004
George had trouble again last night.

172
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:18,574
All right, meet me out the front.

173
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:20,606
Which George? King George? Angry George?

174
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:22,175
George of the Dragon?
Be clear, Arthur.

175
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:23,844
- Which George?
- Our George.

176
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:25,971
<i>Chinese George, Kung-Fu George.</i>

177
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:28,015
- George?
- Art.

178
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:30,326
<i>- We heard he'd had some trouble with the...</i>
- Vikings.

179
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,830
Well, none of them are house-trained.

180
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,520
- I thought you'd warned them.
- I did.

181
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:35,063
They don't speak English good.

182
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,430
They speak it better than you.

183
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:37,774
<i>Hold up, hold up. Back up.</i>

184
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:40,485
Are you sure you didn't see someone else
before you saw George?

185
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,821
Morning, Art.

186
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:44,614
We saw Mike.

187
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:45,782
All right, Mike.

188
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:47,510
Mike the Spike? Kosher Mike? Which Mike?

189
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:48,785
You're giving me a headache.

190
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:49,953
Flat-Nose Mike.

191
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,123
<i>He was trafficking furs through
our vicinity without paying a commission.</i>

192
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,333
That's quite a load,
bit bigger than usual.

193
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,186
Yeah, changed last minute.
Just landed on me.

194
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,503
More is better than less.

195
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,190
More is always better than less, Mike.

196
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:02,904
More's definitely better than less, Mike.
You've had a result.

197
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:06,970
I'm sorry, Art. It won't happen again.
I promise.

198
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:08,972
You're all right, Mike.

199
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:10,974
Why have enemies
when you can have friends?

200
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:12,493
- Where'd you put the money?
- What money?

201
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:13,643
- Money?
- What money?

202
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,288
Did you hide it
with the rest of your coffers?

203
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:18,315
You're all over the place. You can't keep
your questions in a straight line.

204
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:20,984
<i>I'm trying to tell a story here
and you keep interrupting.</i>

205
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:22,819
<i>Anyway, I don't have any coffers.</i>

206
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:24,780
Once you've taken your share,

207
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:26,966
and I've looked after the weak and needy,
I'm left broke.

208
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,075
Mike and the furs.

209
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,041
So we're back to that story,
are we now, Jack?

210
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:31,929
- What are you doing, Mike?
- Sharing the wealth.

211
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:33,848
Don't pass it to me, Mike.
It doesn't work like that.

212
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:34,873
Give it to Wet Stick.

213
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,170
I'm Back Lack.
What are you giving it to me for?

214
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,335
What was I thinking?

215
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:40,396
Don't upset the boss, Mike.
He doesn't handle the money.

216
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,797
Sorry, it's been a long day.

217
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:43,507
It's first thing in the morning, Mike.

218
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,383
- Did he pay?
<i>- 'Course he paid.</i>

219
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,635
He's a good boy, that Mike.

220
00:23:46,802 --> 00:23:48,882
Buy some lessons in street etiquette
with the change.

221
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,680
- Change?
- There's no change, Mike.

222
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:52,557
- See you later, Mike.
- Cheers, Mike!

223
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:55,227
What is this about, Jack?

224
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,979
Rebel graffiti. A young boy.

225
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,023
Your boy. Blue Boy.

226
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,399
And he's a good boy.

227
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:03,193
Oi! What are you lot doing?

228
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,440
Don't start getting the wrong end
of the stick, Jack.

229
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:07,030
<i>He's an upstanding citizen.</i>

230
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:08,925
I think I found something
that belongs to you, Lack.

231
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:10,200
What you doing, boy?

232
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:11,368
He's coming back.

233
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:12,536
Who's coming back?

234
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:14,037
The born king.

235
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:16,206
Yeah, and when he does,
he'll spank your arse.

236
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,708
Now, let's get your hands clean
while you still got some.

237
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,515
He'll cut 'em off and have you in chains.

238
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:22,212
If we can catch you, they can catch you.

239
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:24,005
If you can catch him, so can we.

240
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:25,733
Should we go back to George,
and the trouble with the...

241
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:27,134
- Vikings.
- So what happened?

242
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,052
Started throwing their weight about,

243
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:30,679
and then Lucy got the worst of it.

244
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:32,323
- Come again, George?
- They hurt Lucy.

245
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:33,787
- My Lucy?
<i>- That can't happen, Jack.</i>

246
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:35,225
That can never happen, Jack.

247
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:36,619
You see, she's a friend of mine.

248
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:38,123
So you're gonna have to sort her out.

249
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:40,272
They'd been warned. They had to pay.

250
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:42,149
How'd you get money from a Viking?

251
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:44,317
I feel a joke coming on here.

252
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:45,652
You ask him for it.

253
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,822
You're paying and then you're leaving.

254
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:50,846
Nobody's talking to you, sweetheart.

255
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,552
You sit there and be quiet.
You are better at that...

256
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:54,936
Or I'll have to put an arrow
through your lard-loving thigh.

257
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,140
You were unarmed. You just walked
in there and asked them for it?

258
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:00,929
That's right, Jack,
and they gave it to me.

259
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:03,253
<i>They were trying on furs.
The same furs, as it happens,</i>

260
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,255
<i>that Flat-Nose Mike tried to hide from us.</i>

261
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,359
More is always better than less, Mike.

262
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:08,925
Old Greybeard banged on for a bit.

263
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:11,261
I got 50 seasoned men of war.

264
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:14,139
You could shave a pig on the edge
of our blades.

265
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:16,909
If you were unarmed, where'd you find
the blade to put to his throat?

266
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,810
Well, I borrowed it
from his big, silly mate

267
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:21,297
<i>after Back Lack put an arrow
through his lard-loving thigh.</i>

268
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:26,610
Get back!

269
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,486
That's your story, Jack.

270
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:29,696
I am leaving.

271
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:31,823
But I'm leaving with a year's wages.

272
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,867
Old Greybeard surrendered his dignity.

273
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:37,370
<i>Lucy got a year's worth of wages.</i>

274
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:39,623
And the rebel graffiti exists no more

275
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:43,126
because of the law-abiding,
proactive Blue Boy and his fun-loving dad.

276
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:44,294
And then,

277
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:46,296
they all lived happily ever after.

278
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:48,173
No, they didn't, Arthur.

279
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,802
Because for the first time,
there's something you don't know.

280
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:54,596
Something nobody told you.

281
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:56,056
And that is?

282
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,184
They're under the protection of the king.

283
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:06,233
And once you're under the protection
of the king, I can't help you.

284
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:07,484
Nobody can.

285
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:11,321
They're not gonna bother about me.

286
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:16,660
<i>Where do we stand, Mercia?</i>

287
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,995
We're down to the last men
of the right age,

288
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,957
and still no one has pulled the sword.

289
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:24,793
Now put the bird back
in the aviary, Catia.

290
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:33,343
There's a general restlessness
among the people.

291
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,680
More incidents. More graffiti.

292
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:41,142
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

293
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:42,727
<i>- If I'd known...</i>
- Come here.

294
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,271
<i>I want your opinion.</i>

295
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:47,565
Maggie represents the people.

296
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:49,734
She's from one of the oldest families
in England.

297
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,361
She can tell us.

298
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:52,529
Sire.

299
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,031
Do the people love me?

300
00:26:58,118 --> 00:26:59,327
I love Your Majesty,

301
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:04,040
and if I represent the people,
then you have your answer.

302
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,293
Bring us something to eat.

303
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,842
Even I am left to wonder

304
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,094
<i>if we are pushing them too far.</i>

305
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,308
Finish the tower.

306
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,602
Everything else will be academic.

307
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:30,859
Thank you, Maggie.

308
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,211
<i>Wake up!</i>

309
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:52,130
<i>You must control it.</i>

310
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:56,343
Wake up! Listen!

311
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,428
You need to get out of here, now!

312
00:27:58,595 --> 00:27:59,596
What are you doing, Lack?

313
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:02,349
Jack's Eye was telling the truth.
Those red beards are connected.

314
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:03,767
So, what? So are we.

315
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:04,976
No, you don't understand.

316
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:06,770
The Blacklegs are coming.

317
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,106
And when they get here,
they're gonna make an example out of you.

318
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:11,441
You gotta go now.

319
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:13,688
And you can't use the front door.
Get out the window.

320
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:15,278
They're here, move!

321
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:17,614
Open the door!

322
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,949
Oi, you two, in the back!

323
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,785
<i>Kick the door down!</i>

324
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:24,579
Hey!

325
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:30,794
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, of course.

326
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,420
Here we go.

327
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:33,588
All right, fellas?

328
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:35,799
Hello, boy.
What are you doing out at this time?

329
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:39,135
I work on the boats, sir.
Out on the first tide.

330
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:41,429
The boats, eh? What's in the bag?

331
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:43,807
And you're about the right age.

332
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:45,767
Show us your brand.

333
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:51,481
Have you not been tested?

334
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:53,488
I'm always at sea, sir.
Haven't had the chance.

335
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:56,027
Well, that's about to change now.

336
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:59,823
<i>You're going on a boat, all right.
Just not the one you think.</i>

337
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:11,084
<i>- Come on then, get off!
- Single file!</i>

338
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:13,169
<i>Come on, get 'em off.</i>

339
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:16,714
Get your brand, get your drink,
then back on the barge!

340
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:18,174
Move!

341
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:21,344
Move it! Come on! Move!

342
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:22,512
Keep coming!

343
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:25,849
<i>Move it!</i>

344
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:27,767
What's all that about?

345
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:30,064
Guess that's what you get
when you don't pay up.

346
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:31,521
<i>Taking the kids now.</i>

347
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:33,731
<i>What's he got them
all penned up out here for?</i>

348
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:37,444
Well, when you see the king,
why don't you ask him?

349
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,611
Hurry up!

350
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:41,406
Move along!

351
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,710
What was that?

352
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:55,044
God save the king.

353
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,554
Bollocks. Excuse me, mate.

354
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:05,722
Oi.

355
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:06,890
Leave it.

356
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:09,601
Excuse me. Behind you, pal.

357
00:30:10,393 --> 00:30:12,228
Here, mind your back.

358
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:13,980
Oi, pal, there's a line here.

359
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:16,733
John.

360
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:20,695
All right, pal.

361
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,782
As you were, mate.

362
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:28,536
All right, where do you want me?

363
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:31,080
Trigger, I think we got one here.

364
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:34,751
<i>Bouncing on my knee.</i>

365
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:37,420
Where do you think I want you?
Hands on the hilt, stupid.

366
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:05,240
<i>Oi, both hands.</i>

367
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:08,743
I said, both hands.

368
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:14,791
Right, ten digits

369
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,918
round the blunt bit. Give it a tug.

370
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:18,962
<i>Left foot, right foot.</i>

371
00:31:19,254 --> 00:31:20,463
Collect your brand.

372
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,923
Back on the barge.

373
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:30,638
<i>That's everything
you know about him?</i>

374
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:32,493
<i>His people were quick
to disappear.</i>

375
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:35,705
We got what information we could.

376
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:38,708
Got a lot of fingers in a lot of pies.

377
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,210
Blacklegs in his pockets, too.

378
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:45,965
I'll deal with this.

379
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:47,342
My king...

380
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:55,892
Carefully.

381
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:21,751
So you're Uther's son.

382
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,214
Not only did you survive in the gutter,

383
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:31,219
you blossomed out of manure.

384
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:33,137
You've got the wrong man, sire.

385
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:38,810
I was born in a brothel,
on a bridge in Londinium.

386
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:42,271
The sword can only be drawn
by Uther Pendragon

387
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:45,525
or his direct heir.

388
00:33:46,317 --> 00:33:48,986
<i>You felt it, didn't you?</i>

389
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:50,238
<i>The power.</i>

390
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:52,365
That's what put you out.

391
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:55,493
You just don't know how to control it.

392
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,830
I'm nothing but the bastard son
of a prostitute.

393
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:01,999
You and I have a lot more
in common than you think.

394
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:04,794
It's not just the same blood we share

395
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:08,089
but also the same interests.

396
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,092
<i>We both developed a palate for power.</i>

397
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:13,970
I've never had any power.

398
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:16,180
Or any desire to achieve it.

399
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:19,058
<i>Sire,</i>

400
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:22,437
I could simply drift away,

401
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:24,480
never to be seen again.

402
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:28,109
As much as I'd like to believe you,
your character makes that unlikely.

403
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,653
<i>While you were asleep,</i>

404
00:34:31,696 --> 00:34:32,989
<i>we've been busy.</i>

405
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:35,658
<i>I know what kind of a man you are.</i>

406
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:37,577
<i>I know your story.</i>

407
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:40,830
<i>And, I've seen your coffers.</i>

408
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:44,751
Your achievements

409
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:47,628
now stand

410
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:51,716
as your prosecution.

411
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:57,972
What kind of a man would you have become,

412
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:00,641
had you inherited your father's kingdom

413
00:35:00,808 --> 00:35:03,436
<i>and all its advantages</i>

414
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:05,897
<i>instead of being raised in a brothel?</i>

415
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:12,195
What gave you such drive?

416
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:19,076
Hmm.

417
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,251
So, what happens now?

418
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:29,670
You know what happens now.

419
00:35:31,422 --> 00:35:33,424
You're quickly becoming a legend.

420
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,392
Someone here to see you.

421
00:35:43,643 --> 00:35:44,811
Mmm-hmm.

422
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:46,896
I think you need to see her.

423
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:15,341
Do you know who I am?

424
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,469
I know who you are, Mage.

425
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:21,264
<i>I've seen you in my dreams.</i>

426
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,685
You've been sent by Merlin.

427
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:28,020
Then you know why I am here.

428
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:30,439
So, you will be his guide.

429
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:32,441
And you will help me.

430
00:36:53,963 --> 00:36:55,047
Bring him here.

431
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:01,262
There's a crowd of thousands out there.

432
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:06,142
They've come to see you
more than they've come to see me.

433
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:24,827
<i>I will show them power.</i>

434
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:28,623
<i>I will show them strength</i>

435
00:37:29,332 --> 00:37:30,791
<i>and dignity.</i>

436
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,296
<i>You will show them lies, weakness,</i>

437
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:37,298
<i>and shame.</i>

438
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:39,008
Hail, King Vortigern!

439
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:41,636
King Vortigern!

440
00:37:42,345 --> 00:37:44,013
<i>They may have come for you,</i>

441
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,765
<i>but they will leave</i>

442
00:37:45,932 --> 00:37:48,142
<i>and will leave with
a lasting impression of me.</i>

443
00:37:49,727 --> 00:37:51,896
<i>They may even hate me.</i>

444
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:54,649
<i>I'll let them hate</i>

445
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:56,734
<i>just so long as they fear.</i>

446
00:37:57,068 --> 00:37:58,527
<i>When people fear you,</i>

447
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:01,030
<i>I mean, really fear you,</i>

448
00:38:01,197 --> 00:38:04,700
<i>it is the most</i>

449
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:07,119
<i>intoxicating sensation</i>

450
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:08,955
a man can possess.

451
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:15,169
A force of something almost indescribable
moves through your blood

452
00:38:15,336 --> 00:38:16,545
and takes you over completely.

453
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:23,177
King Vortigern!
King Vortigern! King Vortigern!

454
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:39,443
I understand that your actions
were very noble,

455
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,320
of defending this whore's honor.

456
00:38:42,113 --> 00:38:46,575
<i>How unfortunate it was at the expense
of my Viking guests.</i>

457
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:51,372
<i>King Vortigern! King Vortigern!
King Vortigern!</i>

458
00:39:04,802 --> 00:39:07,430
Behold, your born king.

459
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:13,894
<i>Behold the man
who pulled sword from stone.</i>

460
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:16,897
You wanted a prophecy.

461
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:21,736
This is your prophecy.

462
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:23,904
Now tell us, king,

463
00:39:24,947 --> 00:39:26,198
what do you have to say?

464
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:28,784
<i>When your head rolls to me,</i>

465
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:31,954
<i>the legend you've fast become
will just as quickly...</i>

466
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:33,414
Here are your people.

467
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:35,958
<i>...add to the reverence of my name.</i>

468
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:38,461
And for this,

469
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:41,464
I salute you.

470
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:50,181
No!

471
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:53,309
<i>- If you're the king...</i>
- No!

472
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:54,477
...declare yourself.

473
00:39:57,813 --> 00:39:58,933
<i>The rest of them will follow</i>

474
00:39:59,023 --> 00:40:01,317
<i>unless you do what needs to be done.</i>

475
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:03,069
Do we understand each other?

476
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:09,992
<i>If you are lost for words,</i>

477
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:12,161
<i>then let the sword speak for you.</i>

478
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:14,914
<i>Take it!</i>

479
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:18,667
And show the people
the power of Excalibur.

480
00:40:25,758 --> 00:40:27,551
<i>I said, take it, king.</i>

481
00:40:28,594 --> 00:40:29,845
Raise that sword!

482
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:36,685
I thought not.

483
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:38,729
<i>This man</i>

484
00:40:38,896 --> 00:40:41,524
cannot be allowed to bring discord

485
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,234
<i>to our flourishing nation.</i>

486
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:46,028
<i>You're not the king!</i>

487
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:50,366
<i>Off with his head!</i>

488
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:57,206
<i>You're no king!</i>

489
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:36,162
Protect the king!

490
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:38,789
- Protect the king!
- Come.

491
00:42:02,396 --> 00:42:04,940
- Come on!
- Move! Move!

492
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:06,817
Get the sword! Get after him!

493
00:42:07,026 --> 00:42:10,571
<i>The sword!</i>

494
00:42:15,034 --> 00:42:16,118
Move!

495
00:42:22,249 --> 00:42:24,210
Come on. Move!

496
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,303
Come on!

497
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:36,263
Now!

498
00:43:15,344 --> 00:43:18,347
Someone gonna tell me
where we're going?

499
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:21,183
No.

500
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:37,700
So what is it you're looking at, then?

501
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,037
Are you falling for me
like I'm falling for you?

502
00:43:43,497 --> 00:43:45,040
We wanna be careful.

503
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:51,505
That's a neat trick.

504
00:43:51,672 --> 00:43:53,232
You'll have to teach me how to do that.

505
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:55,467
Put him back on his horse.

506
00:44:16,196 --> 00:44:17,239
Oh, hello.

507
00:44:19,742 --> 00:44:22,077
It's quite dangerous
being one of you lot, isn't it?

508
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:24,371
<i>You're good with animals, aren't you?</i>

509
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,915
They have a word for that, don't they?

510
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:30,002
"Mage."

511
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:33,005
I thought your team was outlawed.

512
00:44:33,172 --> 00:44:35,132
<i>Never met one of you in the flesh.</i>

513
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:37,593
I thought you'd be taller.

514
00:44:38,969 --> 00:44:39,970
And have a beard.

515
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:46,185
You do know I can see through this?

516
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:48,270
Trees everywhere.

517
00:45:13,128 --> 00:45:14,213
Hang that up.

518
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,881
Don't want it getting creased.

519
00:45:35,317 --> 00:45:38,946
So, you're the chap
that turned in Goosefat Bill.

520
00:45:41,323 --> 00:45:44,952
Unlike you,
he chose the wrong place to hide.

521
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:49,832
You know he was the third most wanted man
on the Blackleg's list?

522
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:52,251
They've been trying to catch him
for some time.

523
00:45:52,418 --> 00:45:55,003
Like I said, your man chose
the wrong place to hide.

524
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:56,964
So it seems.

525
00:45:58,632 --> 00:46:00,926
I was wondering what happened to you.

526
00:46:01,093 --> 00:46:02,845
I told you, you were in safe hands.

527
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:06,056
You've made quite a celebrity of yourself
among the Blackleg ranks.

528
00:46:06,223 --> 00:46:08,851
You've done very nicely
on the back of your cozy relationship

529
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:10,310
with your kingsmen.

530
00:46:10,477 --> 00:46:13,147
You know, I'm a little old
for finger-wagging and speeches.

531
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:17,568
So, unless you're my dad,
which, I believe, is unlikely,

532
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:20,334
can you just get around to telling me
exactly what it is you want?

533
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,365
What is it that you want?

534
00:46:23,657 --> 00:46:25,701
I want to get my arse out of here

535
00:46:25,868 --> 00:46:28,203
and see what's left of my life
and the people in it.

536
00:46:28,871 --> 00:46:30,706
<i>But you're not gonna let me do that,
are you?</i>

537
00:46:30,873 --> 00:46:32,207
And why aren't we?

538
00:46:32,374 --> 00:46:33,667
You just lost two men.

539
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:39,298
<i>But you were prepared to lose five
to save this pretty neck.</i>

540
00:46:39,465 --> 00:46:41,425
- Do I know you?
- You will in a minute.

541
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:42,968
Put your hands out.

542
00:46:43,385 --> 00:46:44,720
I don't think so, mate.

543
00:46:44,887 --> 00:46:46,722
So I'm not going anywhere, am I?

544
00:46:46,889 --> 00:46:48,324
Where exactly were you thinking of going?

545
00:46:48,348 --> 00:46:50,392
You have no more home.
It was razed days ago.

546
00:46:50,893 --> 00:46:52,728
<i>You've no more life to go back to.</i>

547
00:46:52,895 --> 00:46:55,105
Like it or not, this is your lot.

548
00:46:56,773 --> 00:46:58,734
And even we don't like you.

549
00:46:58,901 --> 00:46:59,943
Do we, Goosefat?

550
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:05,741
But what we are interested in

551
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:09,119
is what you can do with this sword.

552
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:13,749
Why don't you leave him with me
for a minute or two, boss?

553
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:18,545
Put your ring back on, honey tits.

554
00:47:18,712 --> 00:47:21,673
You haven't had enough porridge
this morning to talk like that.

555
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,259
And if you like that sword so much,
Your Lordship,

556
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:25,761
you can keep it

557
00:47:26,345 --> 00:47:27,679
to peel your grapes.

558
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:30,849
Now that would've hurt a lot more

559
00:47:31,016 --> 00:47:32,768
if I left the ring on.

560
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,359
I see what you're doing.

561
00:47:40,526 --> 00:47:43,046
You're trying to get me to do something
razzle-dazzle with that sword.

562
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:45,405
I'm gonna tell you right now,

563
00:47:45,614 --> 00:47:47,533
I'm not gettin' drawn into this mess.

564
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:50,035
And there's an army of you.

565
00:47:50,202 --> 00:47:51,745
There's only one of me.

566
00:47:52,788 --> 00:47:54,873
I haven't had a fight for years.

567
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:56,792
And I'll talk.

568
00:47:57,459 --> 00:47:58,710
I'm happy to talk.

569
00:48:00,087 --> 00:48:02,089
But there is no way

570
00:48:03,632 --> 00:48:05,384
that I am fighting.

571
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:44,840
Is that it?

572
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:58,729
<i>Run, son!</i>

573
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:49,363
<i>Wait here, son.</i>

574
00:49:52,074 --> 00:49:53,200
<i>Run, son!</i>

575
00:50:02,793 --> 00:50:04,378
You are resisting the sword.

576
00:50:06,505 --> 00:50:08,548
The sword isn't resisting you.

577
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:11,343
It should be clear by now

578
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:15,597
that whatever it is that you
and your friends think you want from me,

579
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,101
I am not it.

580
00:50:19,935 --> 00:50:22,104
<i>- Not yet.</i>
- Not ever!

581
00:50:23,647 --> 00:50:25,774
What do you see when you hold the sword?

582
00:50:27,943 --> 00:50:31,113
It is something
you've seen before, isn't it?

583
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:33,323
Long before you ever touched the sword.

584
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:37,452
<i>You don't sleep well, do you?</i>

585
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:43,208
What if you could make the dreams go away?

586
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:53,218
You know what we have to do.

587
00:50:53,385 --> 00:50:55,470
In order for him to control Excalibur,

588
00:50:55,637 --> 00:50:57,472
he needs to go to the Darklands.

589
00:50:57,639 --> 00:50:58,765
That's not happening.

590
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:02,269
Welcome to the Darklands.

591
00:51:07,816 --> 00:51:08,817
That's the Darklands?

592
00:51:08,984 --> 00:51:10,277
That's the entrance.

593
00:51:13,822 --> 00:51:15,949
He needs to take the sword to the tower.

594
00:51:16,116 --> 00:51:18,285
You must touch the sword
to the altar stone.

595
00:51:23,165 --> 00:51:24,166
Gonna miss me.

596
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:27,210
- Give me another way.
- There's no other way.

597
00:51:28,336 --> 00:51:29,921
<i>And he has to go alone.</i>

598
00:51:39,514 --> 00:51:41,224
He can't survive the Darklands alone.

599
00:51:46,062 --> 00:51:48,023
- Are you scared?
- I think I can manage.

600
00:51:55,155 --> 00:51:56,448
You should be scared.

601
00:52:17,594 --> 00:52:19,137
That's what all the fuss is about?

602
00:52:43,453 --> 00:52:46,456
Don't worry, you'll soon understand
what all the fuss is about.

603
00:52:52,295 --> 00:52:54,398
You don't want all of him to survive.
That's the point.

604
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:57,300
<i>You have to break his old self completely.
Wear him down.</i>

605
00:52:58,093 --> 00:52:59,219
You want him to think big?

606
00:53:02,097 --> 00:53:03,617
Give him something big to think about.

607
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:10,105
You're playing with fire, Mage.

608
00:53:10,272 --> 00:53:12,512
And I'm not killing the king
before he's even become one.

609
00:54:29,851 --> 00:54:31,186
Wait here, son.

610
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,063
No!

611
00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:24,030
Run, son!

612
00:56:51,326 --> 00:56:53,703
<i>Did you see
everything you needed to see?</i>

613
00:56:54,829 --> 00:56:55,872
I saw enough.

614
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:00,085
<i>The Mage Tower.</i>

615
00:57:00,668 --> 00:57:02,504
It's the same as the one at Camelot.

616
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:05,673
The higher Vortigern builds it,
the more powerful he becomes.

617
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:09,135
And when it is finished,
he will have the same power of Mordred.

618
00:57:09,469 --> 00:57:12,138
<i>That is why the sword
has revealed itself now.</i>

619
00:57:12,806 --> 00:57:15,558
Where there's poison, there's a remedy.

620
00:57:17,018 --> 00:57:18,686
What happened to your people?

621
00:57:19,896 --> 00:57:21,815
They were murdered by your uncle.

622
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:25,527
It was Vortigern who started the wars.

623
00:57:26,361 --> 00:57:28,196
<i>He was jealous of your father's throne.</i>

624
00:57:29,155 --> 00:57:31,741
<i>So he made a deal with Mordred</i>

625
00:57:31,908 --> 00:57:33,034
<i>that they would share power</i>

626
00:57:33,368 --> 00:57:36,538
<i>once he defeated your father.</i>

627
00:57:38,081 --> 00:57:41,459
<i>Mordred murdered the Mage King</i>

628
00:57:41,626 --> 00:57:44,754
<i>and took his staff to their sacred tower,</i>

629
00:57:45,922 --> 00:57:49,217
<i>where he unlocked the dark forces
of their union.</i>

630
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:57,100
But what they didn't account for
was the sword.

631
00:57:57,934 --> 00:58:00,645
<i>Merlin stole his staff.</i>

632
00:58:02,689 --> 00:58:06,818
<i>He then forged the great sword, Excalibur,</i>

633
00:58:06,985 --> 00:58:09,529
<i>and destroyed the ancient tower.</i>

634
00:58:10,738 --> 00:58:13,658
<i>The sword was then passed
to the Lady of the Lake,</i>

635
00:58:14,242 --> 00:58:17,370
<i>who bound it to the Pendragon bloodline.</i>

636
00:58:21,624 --> 00:58:23,126
<i>Now,</i>

637
00:58:23,418 --> 00:58:25,420
<i>the sword is yours.</i>

638
00:58:27,547 --> 00:58:30,383
<i>It seems his people
have been found by the Resistance.</i>

639
00:58:31,009 --> 00:58:33,595
You have 10,000 men under your command

640
00:58:35,096 --> 00:58:37,265
for the purpose of maintaining
public order.

641
00:58:37,432 --> 00:58:39,100
Informants have been incentivized.

642
00:58:39,267 --> 00:58:41,245
- Mercia...
- Our garrisons are patrolling the roads

643
00:58:41,269 --> 00:58:42,270
and searching every town.

644
00:58:42,437 --> 00:58:44,517
- It's only a matter of time, Your Majesty.
- Mercia.

645
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:46,417
The Resistance have never posed
any real threat.

646
00:58:46,441 --> 00:58:47,442
Mercia!

647
00:58:51,112 --> 00:58:53,740
Just do your fucking job.

648
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:58,369
Find him.

649
00:59:08,838 --> 00:59:10,298
Smaller than I thought it'd be.

650
00:59:10,465 --> 00:59:12,133
It's all yours, son.

651
00:59:13,051 --> 00:59:14,469
I warn you, it's got quite a bite.

652
00:59:16,512 --> 00:59:17,889
What they done back home?

653
00:59:19,766 --> 00:59:21,184
You really wanna know?

654
00:59:21,684 --> 00:59:22,769
Go on.

655
00:59:22,936 --> 00:59:24,145
It's all gone.

656
00:59:24,312 --> 00:59:25,313
They torched the lot.

657
00:59:26,522 --> 00:59:28,149
I said, go on.

658
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:30,568
You should be flattered, mate.

659
00:59:32,654 --> 00:59:35,490
<i>Even Mercia left the castle
to look for you and that sword.</i>

660
00:59:38,618 --> 00:59:39,661
<i>Jack's Eye turned.</i>

661
00:59:40,495 --> 00:59:43,289
<i>Gave 'em a list of everything you valued.</i>

662
00:59:43,665 --> 00:59:46,251
<i>They slaughtered half the neighborhood.</i>

663
00:59:47,293 --> 00:59:50,004
<i>Mischief John got busy.</i>

664
00:59:50,213 --> 00:59:52,006
<i>Personally burned down the bridge.</i>

665
00:59:53,007 --> 00:59:54,634
It was quite a party.

666
00:59:55,009 --> 00:59:56,636
<i>Shall I continue?</i>

667
00:59:56,803 --> 00:59:58,179
What about the rest of the team?

668
00:59:59,347 --> 01:00:00,890
Most of the girls are with us,

669
01:00:01,683 --> 01:00:04,811
but the rest of the crew pretty much
got gist of your popularity

670
01:00:04,978 --> 01:00:06,479
<i>and made themselves scarce.</i>

671
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,148
Blue, go get us something to drink.

672
01:00:09,941 --> 01:00:11,734
Come on, boss. I'm one of the crew.

673
01:00:11,901 --> 01:00:13,111
<i>Blue!</i>

674
01:00:25,415 --> 01:00:26,666
I'm all right!

675
01:00:54,819 --> 01:00:56,696
I'm gonna kill him.

676
01:00:57,238 --> 01:00:59,407
This lot have been trying to do it
for years.

677
01:00:59,574 --> 01:01:01,284
They'd love to hear you say that.

678
01:01:02,493 --> 01:01:05,913
<i>They've waited a long time to see
a man pull this sword.</i>

679
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,082
I'm not doing this for them.

680
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,293
Wet Stick,

681
01:01:11,127 --> 01:01:12,503
meet Percival.

682
01:01:14,881 --> 01:01:17,300
<i>Rubio, meet Back Lack.</i>

683
01:01:17,467 --> 01:01:18,593
Sir Bedivere,

684
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,846
who runs this aristocratic family
of cave dwellers,

685
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:24,766
<i>meet Blue, son of Back Lack.</i>

686
01:01:25,475 --> 01:01:27,268
The infamous Goosefat Bill

687
01:01:27,435 --> 01:01:28,728
<i>needs no introduction.</i>

688
01:01:28,895 --> 01:01:29,937
<i>So,</i>

689
01:01:30,938 --> 01:01:32,940
you think you can take down Vortigern?

690
01:01:33,107 --> 01:01:35,526
There are 12 barons.

691
01:01:35,693 --> 01:01:37,904
These represent the old families
of England.

692
01:01:38,071 --> 01:01:41,532
<i>Between them, they can rustle up
12,000 warriors.</i>

693
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:45,328
In order to stand a chance, we are going
to need at least some of their support.

694
01:01:45,495 --> 01:01:47,431
We can arrange a meeting
with six of those families...

695
01:01:47,455 --> 01:01:49,165
<i>Let me stop you there.</i>

696
01:01:49,332 --> 01:01:50,625
If I may,

697
01:01:51,417 --> 01:01:53,127
allow me to run you
through the proceedings

698
01:01:53,294 --> 01:01:55,129
as I think they will unfold.

699
01:01:55,296 --> 01:01:56,631
<i>They'll start by telling us...</i>

700
01:01:56,798 --> 01:01:59,967
If you're intending to galvanize
the people of this country

701
01:02:00,134 --> 01:02:01,594
against the current king,

702
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:03,513
<i>there has to be a realistic strategy.</i>

703
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:05,681
Strategy requires leadership.

704
01:02:05,848 --> 01:02:09,936
Then they'll bang on for a while
about how clever and educated they are.

705
01:02:10,103 --> 01:02:12,814
In the art of war, diplomacy,
and chivalry.

706
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,607
And how under qualified I am.

707
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:16,814
Is it not true that this man
was raised in a brothel

708
01:02:16,859 --> 01:02:18,820
<i>and has no formal education of any kind?</i>

709
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:20,488
Then they'll start takin' the piss.

710
01:02:20,655 --> 01:02:22,323
And what are we to be called, Bedivere?

711
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:24,200
"Knights of the Bordello"?

712
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:28,913
Or "The Ladies of the Knight."

713
01:02:29,163 --> 01:02:30,289
Have you finished?

714
01:02:31,332 --> 01:02:32,643
I'm gonna have to pull 'em on it.

715
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:34,147
I'm glad you've got a sense of humor.

716
01:02:34,502 --> 01:02:36,003
'Cause you're gonna need it.

717
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:37,797
I'm gonna be forced to tell them...

718
01:02:37,964 --> 01:02:39,507
There's not a bollock between you.

719
01:02:39,674 --> 01:02:40,925
<i>At which point, Bedivere,</i>

720
01:02:41,092 --> 01:02:42,927
you're gonna get very angry,
and tell me off.

721
01:02:43,094 --> 01:02:45,096
You'll say something along the lines of,

722
01:02:45,263 --> 01:02:46,347
"What were you gonna do

723
01:02:46,514 --> 01:02:47,825
<i>"if they wanted to fight?"
And I'm gonna say,</i>

724
01:02:47,849 --> 01:02:48,975
<i>"I was never gonna fight."</i>

725
01:02:49,142 --> 01:02:50,577
And you're gonna say,
"Well, what was gonna happen?"

726
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:52,496
<i>And I was gonna say,
"That's what you're here for, Bedivere,</i>"

727
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,188
"you big, silly, posh bastard."

728
01:02:59,193 --> 01:03:01,320
You want Vortigern to stick his neck out

729
01:03:01,487 --> 01:03:03,448
<i>and get him to Londinium?</i>

730
01:03:03,614 --> 01:03:05,366
You need to tease it out.

731
01:03:05,533 --> 01:03:08,369
You don't need 12,000 fighting men
for that.

732
01:03:08,536 --> 01:03:11,038
What you need is this little rabble.

733
01:03:11,706 --> 01:03:13,207
Okay, so how's that gonna work?

734
01:03:13,374 --> 01:03:17,545
If I'm moving too fast for you, Bedivere,
you can let yourself out the side door.

735
01:03:18,129 --> 01:03:20,715
You seem to have found your way
very quickly.

736
01:03:21,048 --> 01:03:24,010
Now, come on, kid. You're cooking dinner.

737
01:03:24,177 --> 01:03:27,597
What is it that Vortigern cares about
most in the world?

738
01:03:27,889 --> 01:03:29,098
Killing you.

739
01:03:29,557 --> 01:03:30,600
Apart from that.

740
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:32,351
Getting the sword.

741
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:34,645
Could someone help me out here, please?

742
01:03:34,812 --> 01:03:36,707
- Finishing his tower.
<i>- So what do we do about it?</i>

743
01:03:36,731 --> 01:03:39,291
<i>Sink his barges carrying his supply
of stone. Block up the river.</i>

744
01:03:39,859 --> 01:03:42,099
Chaps, wouldn't it be easier
just to go through the side?

745
01:03:42,278 --> 01:03:44,572
See? That's the problem with an education.

746
01:03:44,739 --> 01:03:46,032
It gets in the way.

747
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:48,409
These boats are made out of seasoned oak.

748
01:03:48,576 --> 01:03:49,827
They're uncrackable.

749
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:52,114
So you need to go through the deck
to get to the keel.

750
01:03:52,246 --> 01:03:55,625
No, you need to go through the bulkhead
to get to the stern.

751
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:57,210
What are you doing?

752
01:03:57,376 --> 01:03:58,419
You're wasting your time.

753
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:00,755
I've told you they're uncrackable.

754
01:04:02,173 --> 01:04:03,674
<i>See, Wet Stick, Back Lack?</i>

755
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:05,510
That's what an education gets ya.

756
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:09,055
My sincere apologies, Your Majesty.

757
01:04:09,222 --> 01:04:11,807
The stone barges have been sunk,
and they've blocked the river.

758
01:04:11,974 --> 01:04:13,684
What else? Come on, more ideas.

759
01:04:13,893 --> 01:04:15,478
Interrupt his supply of slaves.

760
01:04:16,145 --> 01:04:17,897
<i>Excellent.
How are we gonna do that?</i>

761
01:04:18,064 --> 01:04:19,524
We know their transportation routes.

762
01:04:19,941 --> 01:04:21,275
Oof! Now we're warmin' up.

763
01:04:32,453 --> 01:04:33,788
Come on, ideas.

764
01:04:34,497 --> 01:04:36,499
Burn his favorite palace down.

765
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:37,792
How you gonna do that, then?

766
01:04:37,959 --> 01:04:39,919
I know the man that supplies brandy
to the palace.

767
01:04:40,086 --> 01:04:41,254
<i>Shipment first of the month.</i>

768
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:42,672
All right, Dan. Wine or brandy?

769
01:04:42,838 --> 01:04:44,632
- Brandy.
- Open the doors.

770
01:04:50,638 --> 01:04:51,806
What a waste of brandy.

771
01:04:52,181 --> 01:04:54,642
But doesn't it make the palace burn well?

772
01:04:56,477 --> 01:04:59,480
10,000 boys. All under 12 years.

773
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:03,150
Young enough to forget their families,
and to have no other loyalty than to you.

774
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:06,153
Plus, 5,000 more each year

775
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,823
for as long as you grant us passage
through your seas.

776
01:05:09,365 --> 01:05:10,533
The north is ours?

777
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:11,993
That is our agreement.

778
01:05:23,504 --> 01:05:24,839
Is there a problem?

779
01:05:28,926 --> 01:05:31,429
There are rumors, Great King.

780
01:05:31,596 --> 01:05:32,847
Even across the seas,

781
01:05:33,014 --> 01:05:36,350
we have heard the legend of the sword,

782
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:38,978
of a king

783
01:05:39,145 --> 01:05:41,981
other than yourself.

784
01:05:42,148 --> 01:05:45,693
I would be doing my own king a disservice

785
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:48,446
if I did not ask this question.

786
01:05:51,741 --> 01:05:53,951
Are the boys yours to give?

787
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:56,730
Do you really consider your faith
better served by a rumor?

788
01:05:57,038 --> 01:06:00,124
<i>Or by the word of the
conqueror of this island</i>

789
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:04,045
with an army of 100,000 souls
behind his sword?

790
01:06:13,054 --> 01:06:17,141
I meant no disrespect, Great King.

791
01:06:33,866 --> 01:06:36,118
You asked to see me, Father?

792
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:40,956
We need the support of all the barons.

793
01:06:41,123 --> 01:06:43,125
Set a meeting in Londinium.

794
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:45,044
For the six we doubt.

795
01:06:45,211 --> 01:06:48,381
Whatever it takes to hunt him down.

796
01:07:26,377 --> 01:07:27,586
I still can't control it.

797
01:07:27,753 --> 01:07:28,796
Pick it up.

798
01:07:29,672 --> 01:07:31,006
You pick it up.

799
01:07:31,173 --> 01:07:32,299
Pick it up with both hands.

800
01:07:35,678 --> 01:07:37,638
Did you see everything you needed to see?

801
01:07:38,222 --> 01:07:39,265
Where?

802
01:07:39,432 --> 01:07:40,891
<i>In the Darklands.</i>

803
01:07:41,934 --> 01:07:43,102
Did you look away?

804
01:07:45,396 --> 01:07:48,607
You want to know
why you still can't use it.

805
01:07:48,774 --> 01:07:49,900
Why don't you tell me?

806
01:07:50,067 --> 01:07:52,319
I think you know the answer.

807
01:07:52,695 --> 01:07:55,489
You will face it
when it's worth it to you.

808
01:07:56,365 --> 01:07:59,076
<i>Don't get me wrong, I look away.</i>

809
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:01,036
We all look away.

810
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:04,707
But that is the difference
between a man and a king.

811
01:08:13,382 --> 01:08:14,425
Maggie!

812
01:08:15,509 --> 01:08:18,095
I thought we agreed
that you'd never come here.

813
01:08:18,262 --> 01:08:19,305
You need to hear this.

814
01:08:20,389 --> 01:08:23,267
Vortigern is making a visit to Londinium
to meet with the barons.

815
01:08:23,434 --> 01:08:25,186
<i>- He will travel by barge.</i>
- When?

816
01:08:26,562 --> 01:08:28,898
- Three days from now.
- Hmm.

817
01:08:29,523 --> 01:08:31,066
Looks like your plan worked.

818
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:33,194
You need to be careful.

819
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,322
<i>His power is increasing.</i>

820
01:09:31,335 --> 01:09:33,462
The building's right.
The angle's right.

821
01:09:33,629 --> 01:09:36,048
Three exits from which to leave the city.

822
01:09:36,215 --> 01:09:39,426
A vantage point over the whole dock
and most of the town.

823
01:09:39,593 --> 01:09:42,096
It's a 50-yard shot. I can do that easily.
What's the problem?

824
01:09:42,513 --> 01:09:43,597
Tell him.

825
01:09:43,764 --> 01:09:45,164
Tell you what the problem is, mate.

826
01:09:45,266 --> 01:09:47,911
When you say the building's right,
I know the man that owns that building.

827
01:09:47,935 --> 01:09:49,937
<i>And he's not interested
in letting anyone in.</i>

828
01:09:50,104 --> 01:09:51,832
How do you feel about
a rooftop king assassination?

829
01:09:51,856 --> 01:09:52,857
- My roof?
- Yeah.

830
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:55,585
And least of all the king's assassins
that he'll have to hang for.

831
01:09:55,609 --> 01:09:57,111
- I'd hang?
- Probably.

832
01:09:58,821 --> 01:10:00,341
The three exits are actually only one.

833
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,887
'Cause once the alarm arrow's fired,

834
01:10:02,533 --> 01:10:04,785
<i>the gates will be shut
within two minutes,</i>

835
01:10:04,952 --> 01:10:06,704
<i>and they're six minutes away by foot.</i>

836
01:10:06,871 --> 01:10:09,999
Unless you can run like
a Neapolitan stallion, I'd forget them.

837
01:10:10,165 --> 01:10:11,792
<i>So, you have one exit remaining.</i>

838
01:10:12,334 --> 01:10:14,211
And that has a tavern 20 yards from it.

839
01:10:14,545 --> 01:10:16,839
<i>There's always more Blacklegs
in the Two Hot Cocks</i>

840
01:10:17,006 --> 01:10:18,632
<i>than there are rats on the street.</i>

841
01:10:18,799 --> 01:10:21,468
Why don't you use the other building?
The one back here?

842
01:10:23,137 --> 01:10:24,972
Because it's 175 yards away.

843
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:27,141
<i>And how far
can you shoot, Back Lack?</i>

844
01:10:27,308 --> 01:10:29,602
Accurately? 75.

845
01:10:29,768 --> 01:10:30,936
<i>Bill?</i>

846
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,521
175.

847
01:10:32,688 --> 01:10:33,731
Same as...

848
01:10:33,898 --> 01:10:36,150
No, he said, "175."

849
01:10:36,358 --> 01:10:39,028
All right, mate,
of course you can.

850
01:10:49,538 --> 01:10:52,333
That's about 175 yards, isn't it?

851
01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:54,460
Well, he was supposed to signal.

852
01:10:54,627 --> 01:10:55,628
Can't see him.

853
01:10:55,794 --> 01:10:57,421
Well, we can't see them.

854
01:10:57,588 --> 01:10:58,923
And they can't see us.

855
01:10:59,089 --> 01:11:00,257
Hey!

856
01:11:02,051 --> 01:11:04,136
Maybe they thought that was luck.

857
01:11:06,263 --> 01:11:07,598
That could've killed us.

858
01:11:10,017 --> 01:11:12,645
They scream like girls, your friends.

859
01:11:18,734 --> 01:11:19,735
Bill?

860
01:11:19,985 --> 01:11:22,780
The wolf at the head of the pack.

861
01:11:23,322 --> 01:11:24,740
<i>Goosefat,</i>

862
01:11:24,907 --> 01:11:26,033
everything all right?

863
01:11:27,409 --> 01:11:28,702
<i>- Goosefat!</i>
- Mmm.

864
01:11:28,869 --> 01:11:30,537
Is there something I should know here?

865
01:11:30,704 --> 01:11:31,705
Those two have a history.

866
01:11:31,872 --> 01:11:33,934
Well, whatever it is,
that's not what we're here for.

867
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:35,626
- Is it, Goosefat?
- Mmm.

868
01:11:35,834 --> 01:11:36,919
They've arrived.

869
01:11:39,296 --> 01:11:43,008
Maggie, I now realize what an important
member of my household you are.

870
01:11:43,175 --> 01:11:45,302
- Your Majesty...
<i>- I haven't finished.</i>

871
01:11:46,345 --> 01:11:47,638
Sit down.

872
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:51,183
<i>Till recently,</i>

873
01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:55,145
I didn't recognize what a powerful tool
you can be in the right hands.

874
01:11:55,562 --> 01:11:57,690
<i>I thought you were simply a pawn.</i>

875
01:11:57,856 --> 01:12:00,484
<i>Turns out
you're a far more significant piece.</i>

876
01:12:00,651 --> 01:12:03,070
And it would be witless of me

877
01:12:03,237 --> 01:12:06,073
not to use that to my advantage,

878
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,701
given how effectively
you've been used against me.

879
01:12:10,995 --> 01:12:12,746
<i>Hail to the king!</i>

880
01:12:13,205 --> 01:12:14,331
There's the king.

881
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:25,467
Something doesn't smell right.

882
01:12:33,517 --> 01:12:34,601
<i>This is too easy.</i>

883
01:12:37,021 --> 01:12:38,814
Wait. Wait, wait. Don't fire.

884
01:12:38,981 --> 01:12:41,108
- Why not?
- Something doesn't smell right.

885
01:12:41,275 --> 01:12:43,193
It smells as right
as it's ever going to smell.

886
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,320
Come on, he's right there.

887
01:12:45,487 --> 01:12:46,864
Bill! Get on with it!

888
01:12:47,031 --> 01:12:49,074
- It's a trap.
- How would he know?

889
01:12:49,241 --> 01:12:50,576
Don't know. Maggie.

890
01:12:50,784 --> 01:12:53,120
<i>Maybe he knows she's working for us.</i>

891
01:12:53,287 --> 01:12:55,497
I am telling you. That is not the king.

892
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:00,627
Stop looking around and look at me.

893
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:02,963
I'm a target, aren't I?

894
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:05,257
God help us. They've sent me a buffoon.

895
01:13:06,967 --> 01:13:09,720
You are a cunning old bastard, Vortigern.

896
01:13:10,137 --> 01:13:11,722
<i>But what you fail to understand</i>

897
01:13:11,889 --> 01:13:16,018
is that it's you who's fed the hangman
that will eventually come for you.

898
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:18,919
You're right, that's not Vortigern.

899
01:13:19,063 --> 01:13:20,439
But at least Mercia's here.

900
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:22,941
<i>Goosefat.</i>

901
01:13:27,196 --> 01:13:29,531
What have you done?
You can't shoot if it's a trap!

902
01:13:29,698 --> 01:13:31,298
They'll never know where that came from.

903
01:13:32,576 --> 01:13:33,577
<i>You missed him anyway.</i>

904
01:13:35,454 --> 01:13:36,497
I didn't miss anyone.

905
01:13:43,253 --> 01:13:44,421
Arrow!

906
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,806
What are you doing?
They're not targets at a fair!

907
01:13:53,972 --> 01:13:55,808
That was Clarendon. He earned that.

908
01:13:58,519 --> 01:13:59,686
<i>You might survive today.</i>

909
01:14:01,021 --> 01:14:02,606
But the noose has been tied.

910
01:14:07,027 --> 01:14:08,070
We need to go. Now!

911
01:14:08,237 --> 01:14:10,030
Now. We need to go now.

912
01:14:35,055 --> 01:14:36,056
Put your arms up.

913
01:14:41,603 --> 01:14:42,980
Hello, boys. Wait, wait.

914
01:14:43,147 --> 01:14:45,315
Hey, hey, hey.
Where are you going? Stop.

915
01:14:50,988 --> 01:14:51,989
Oi! Oi!

916
01:14:54,116 --> 01:14:55,242
Sarge!

917
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:57,619
Hey! Stop!

918
01:15:02,749 --> 01:15:03,834
Fuck me.

919
01:15:08,672 --> 01:15:09,673
Let's go!

920
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,901
- I'm holding you up. Go on without me.
- No, Lack, come on. Let's go.

921
01:15:11,925 --> 01:15:13,236
- No, I'll see you at the safe house.
- I'm not leaving you!

922
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:14,261
Just go!

923
01:15:16,221 --> 01:15:17,264
There they are!

924
01:15:28,859 --> 01:15:29,943
Move!

925
01:15:43,457 --> 01:15:45,167
This way, this way.

926
01:15:46,293 --> 01:15:47,461
Let's go!

927
01:15:47,961 --> 01:15:50,214
Move! Move! Move!

928
01:15:50,505 --> 01:15:51,506
Move!

929
01:15:51,673 --> 01:15:53,175
- Move!
- Move!

930
01:16:15,822 --> 01:16:16,823
<i>Get out of the way!</i>

931
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:18,033
Left! Go left!

932
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,201
Over here!

933
01:16:21,078 --> 01:16:22,496
Argh!

934
01:16:31,171 --> 01:16:32,839
Hey. Here.

935
01:16:34,216 --> 01:16:35,550
In here. This way!

936
01:16:58,198 --> 01:16:59,241
We can't stay here.

937
01:17:00,701 --> 01:17:01,702
Where's Lack?

938
01:17:01,868 --> 01:17:03,662
- He's making his own way.
- All right.

939
01:17:03,829 --> 01:17:06,456
- How's Rubio?
- He's leaking, but he'll live.

940
01:17:06,623 --> 01:17:08,709
We need to get to the old bathhouse.

941
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:10,544
If I go down, you follow him.

942
01:17:10,711 --> 01:17:12,504
If he goes down, you follow me.

943
01:17:13,213 --> 01:17:14,214
Come on.

944
01:17:30,814 --> 01:17:32,107
<i>There's too many. This way!</i>

945
01:17:33,233 --> 01:17:34,234
Come on!

946
01:17:34,443 --> 01:17:36,069
Come on, guys!

947
01:17:40,073 --> 01:17:41,074
Can you make it?

948
01:17:41,241 --> 01:17:42,281
I can make it, no problem.

949
01:17:46,997 --> 01:17:47,998
Over here!

950
01:17:48,165 --> 01:17:49,249
Hey! Come on!

951
01:17:56,798 --> 01:17:58,425
- Rubio!
- Come back!

952
01:17:58,592 --> 01:17:59,801
Rubio!

953
01:18:01,053 --> 01:18:02,095
Come on!

954
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:09,269
They need your help.

955
01:18:25,911 --> 01:18:27,788
Lock the door, George.

956
01:18:32,834 --> 01:18:34,062
Get the lads out the back door, George.

957
01:18:34,086 --> 01:18:35,206
It's not gonna happen, boss.

958
01:18:35,253 --> 01:18:36,647
They hate the Blackleg and love a fight.

959
01:18:36,671 --> 01:18:37,714
There's too many of them.

960
01:18:37,881 --> 01:18:39,800
It's not gonna happen.
They live for this.

961
01:18:39,966 --> 01:18:41,343
They're gonna die, George!

962
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:43,110
They trained their whole lives for this.

963
01:19:00,153 --> 01:19:01,238
- Go on.
- Let go. Let go.

964
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:13,083
Come on! Move!

965
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:14,751
- Fight!
- Second rank!

966
01:19:14,918 --> 01:19:17,170
You two, down here.
It's a straight run to the river.

967
01:19:17,337 --> 01:19:18,338
You go first.

968
01:19:19,172 --> 01:19:20,841
We don't have time to argue, Bill.

969
01:19:21,007 --> 01:19:23,343
Some of us will make it out in time.
Some of us won't.

970
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:24,845
Well, better some than none!

971
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:26,805
You go first.

972
01:19:29,391 --> 01:19:31,351
Mike! Get down the hole.

973
01:19:32,144 --> 01:19:34,271
Mike, get down the hole.

974
01:19:34,438 --> 01:19:35,480
Don't like rats, boss.

975
01:19:36,773 --> 01:19:37,774
Dell.

976
01:19:37,941 --> 01:19:39,109
Scared of the dark.

977
01:19:39,276 --> 01:19:40,652
Really?

978
01:19:40,819 --> 01:19:42,529
George, will you tell them?

979
01:19:42,946 --> 01:19:43,989
Sorry, boss.

980
01:19:44,156 --> 01:19:45,323
Weapons!

981
01:19:49,703 --> 01:19:50,996
You silly bastards.

982
01:19:52,038 --> 01:19:54,416
Determined to die. Shit.

983
01:19:54,583 --> 01:19:56,376
On my command!

984
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:21,813
I'm going down the hole now.

985
01:22:28,778 --> 01:22:30,113
After you.

986
01:22:32,949 --> 01:22:35,368
Blue. Blue. Where you been, mate?

987
01:22:35,535 --> 01:22:36,536
Where's my dad?

988
01:22:36,703 --> 01:22:38,246
We got split up, but he knows his way.

989
01:22:38,413 --> 01:22:39,599
- I've gotta find him.
- Wait, Blue.

990
01:22:39,623 --> 01:22:41,684
Your dad knows what he's doing.
He'll be back before you know it, mate.

991
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:42,792
<i>Wet Stick.</i>

992
01:22:43,752 --> 01:22:46,421
Blue! Blue! Blue!

993
01:22:48,673 --> 01:22:51,217
Come on, boys! Search them dwellings now!

994
01:22:51,384 --> 01:22:53,219
Get through them doors!

995
01:23:02,937 --> 01:23:04,856
It's not gonna be easy
getting out of here now.

996
01:23:05,023 --> 01:23:07,776
You can't stay here long.
Nowhere in the city is safe.

997
01:23:07,942 --> 01:23:09,194
<i>The boat's ready.</i>

998
01:23:09,903 --> 01:23:11,946
<i>What about Back Lack and Blue, Art?</i>

999
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:15,950
We'll wait until dark.

1000
01:23:24,793 --> 01:23:26,419
<i>Where you been, Dad?</i>

1001
01:23:26,586 --> 01:23:27,671
Catching me breath.

1002
01:23:29,589 --> 01:23:30,799
What's wrong?

1003
01:23:30,965 --> 01:23:32,926
Nothing. I'm all right.

1004
01:23:33,093 --> 01:23:34,719
<i>Just got to get to the safe house.</i>

1005
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:37,972
Can you make it?

1006
01:23:40,058 --> 01:23:41,226
I love you, mate.

1007
01:23:42,435 --> 01:23:43,978
Come on, let's get going.

1008
01:23:52,821 --> 01:23:53,905
Run!

1009
01:23:57,826 --> 01:23:58,827
Down with Vortigern!

1010
01:24:11,798 --> 01:24:14,551
It seems as though
you found a way to use the sword.

1011
01:24:14,718 --> 01:24:15,969
<i>I wasn't controlling it.</i>

1012
01:24:18,513 --> 01:24:19,723
Here.

1013
01:24:20,724 --> 01:24:22,892
It was controlling me.

1014
01:24:23,059 --> 01:24:24,644
I can't even remember what happened.

1015
01:24:24,811 --> 01:24:26,146
I can.

1016
01:24:28,398 --> 01:24:29,566
Thank you.

1017
01:24:35,572 --> 01:24:37,824
Something's happening, you know?

1018
01:24:39,576 --> 01:24:41,202
Certainly sounds like it.

1019
01:24:41,369 --> 01:24:43,246
<i>People have seen
what you can do.</i>

1020
01:24:43,413 --> 01:24:44,664
<i>You're no longer a myth.</i>

1021
01:24:45,415 --> 01:24:47,667
You're starting to mean something.

1022
01:24:48,334 --> 01:24:49,669
That wasn't the intention.

1023
01:24:49,836 --> 01:24:51,129
<i>They are fighting in your name.</i>

1024
01:24:52,756 --> 01:24:55,300
I don't wanna wear that.

1025
01:24:58,887 --> 01:25:00,472
Is that you, Blue?

1026
01:25:00,638 --> 01:25:01,639
<i>Yes, boss!</i>

1027
01:25:01,806 --> 01:25:02,849
Did you find your father?

1028
01:25:03,266 --> 01:25:04,434
He's found him!

1029
01:25:06,394 --> 01:25:07,437
Ah!

1030
01:25:16,905 --> 01:25:18,198
We need to get you out of here.

1031
01:25:18,448 --> 01:25:20,283
<i>Let's get your arse
on that boat, Lack.</i>

1032
01:25:20,450 --> 01:25:22,010
There's a good fog to cover our tracks.

1033
01:25:22,494 --> 01:25:23,495
Come on.

1034
01:25:23,661 --> 01:25:25,538
I'll need a little breather.

1035
01:25:25,872 --> 01:25:28,374
Here, load everyone else up
and come back for me.

1036
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:29,542
No, I'll stay with you.

1037
01:25:29,709 --> 01:25:31,961
No, you won't. Give 'em a hand.

1038
01:25:35,298 --> 01:25:37,217
I'll be all right, mate.

1039
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:39,052
Just give me a minute.

1040
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:41,262
Come on, Blue.

1041
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:44,015
You carry this.

1042
01:25:45,308 --> 01:25:47,101
Come on. Come on.

1043
01:25:48,728 --> 01:25:50,522
<i>Come on, Blue.</i>

1044
01:26:05,411 --> 01:26:06,746
<i>Evenin'.</i>

1045
01:26:17,549 --> 01:26:18,800
Pardon the intrusion.

1046
01:26:35,441 --> 01:26:37,861
Our dog was very keen to lead us here.

1047
01:26:38,027 --> 01:26:39,153
Come on.

1048
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:41,114
Shall I pick him up, Sarge?

1049
01:26:41,281 --> 01:26:43,366
No, follow him.

1050
01:26:43,533 --> 01:26:45,159
<i>The blood he followed
was from a man</i>

1051
01:26:45,493 --> 01:26:47,120
<i>who killed one of my sergeants today.</i>

1052
01:26:47,287 --> 01:26:52,125
A man who fled the scene
of an assassination attempt

1053
01:26:52,417 --> 01:26:53,626
on me.

1054
01:26:56,254 --> 01:26:57,839
On me, no less.

1055
01:27:01,301 --> 01:27:03,541
You wouldn't happen to know
where that man is, would you?

1056
01:27:06,472 --> 01:27:07,473
I can't.

1057
01:27:07,974 --> 01:27:09,684
Get in the boat, Blue. I'll get your dad.

1058
01:27:09,851 --> 01:27:11,144
I can't leave him!

1059
01:27:12,228 --> 01:27:14,480
Have a look
at this situation, would ya?

1060
01:27:14,647 --> 01:27:16,774
The king of all England himself

1061
01:27:17,191 --> 01:27:19,986
has made the effort to visit a commoner.

1062
01:27:21,487 --> 01:27:23,323
A man from nowhere,

1063
01:27:24,657 --> 01:27:26,951
and today, my last day.

1064
01:27:29,704 --> 01:27:31,164
<i>You look well,</i>

1065
01:27:31,331 --> 01:27:33,291
and I feel poor.

1066
01:27:34,459 --> 01:27:36,127
But who would I rather be?

1067
01:27:40,715 --> 01:27:41,716
What do you want, kid?

1068
01:27:42,842 --> 01:27:44,093
Who's this young man?

1069
01:27:44,552 --> 01:27:45,970
I'm the cleaner, sir.

1070
01:27:46,471 --> 01:27:47,722
Who's he to you?

1071
01:27:47,889 --> 01:27:49,265
Never seen him before.

1072
01:27:49,891 --> 01:27:53,811
I usually come in later, you know,
do the dishes when they're all gone.

1073
01:27:54,187 --> 01:27:55,313
Is that the truth?

1074
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:57,398
Yes, sir. I'd never lie to a Blackleg.

1075
01:27:58,858 --> 01:28:00,485
Good boy.

1076
01:28:03,821 --> 01:28:05,365
<i>So you don't know him?</i>

1077
01:28:05,531 --> 01:28:06,741
No, sir.

1078
01:28:09,202 --> 01:28:10,995
Then you wouldn't mind
if I cut his ears off?

1079
01:28:11,162 --> 01:28:13,081
<i>They're not my ears.
Do what you want with them.</i>

1080
01:28:26,928 --> 01:28:28,096
No!

1081
01:28:30,598 --> 01:28:33,184
Always wanted a boy.

1082
01:28:33,393 --> 01:28:35,561
- Argh!
- You bastard!

1083
01:28:36,062 --> 01:28:37,772
<i>Leave him alone!</i>

1084
01:28:39,023 --> 01:28:41,025
Now I repeat,

1085
01:28:41,275 --> 01:28:42,944
where's your friend?

1086
01:28:46,072 --> 01:28:47,281
Let him go.

1087
01:28:50,076 --> 01:28:51,077
Let him go.

1088
01:28:55,248 --> 01:28:56,582
Take the boy and...

1089
01:28:57,083 --> 01:28:59,252
No!

1090
01:29:00,086 --> 01:29:01,546
No!

1091
01:29:20,106 --> 01:29:23,276
Crush the Resistance tonight!

1092
01:29:36,205 --> 01:29:37,540
Archers!

1093
01:32:09,025 --> 01:32:12,236
<i>Let me show you</i>

1094
01:32:14,572 --> 01:32:17,742
<i>what your uncle will do</i>

1095
01:32:18,242 --> 01:32:21,746
<i>if you do not accept</i>

1096
01:32:23,956 --> 01:32:25,791
<i>this sword.</i>

1097
01:32:30,004 --> 01:32:32,256
<i>Only you can prevent this.</i>

1098
01:32:36,219 --> 01:32:38,346
<i>He must be met</i>

1099
01:32:38,512 --> 01:32:42,266
<i>where sword meets tower.</i>

1100
01:32:44,769 --> 01:32:47,021
<i>Trust the Mage.</i>

1101
01:32:48,356 --> 01:32:51,609
<i>Take it.</i>

1102
01:33:36,779 --> 01:33:39,031
Apparently you have something to tell me.

1103
01:33:54,171 --> 01:33:55,816
I suppose you wanna know
what happened to me.

1104
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:58,384
I don't wanna push you, but...

1105
01:33:58,551 --> 01:33:59,552
George?

1106
01:33:59,969 --> 01:34:01,762
Riots are spreading.

1107
01:34:01,929 --> 01:34:04,223
Not just in Londinium.
Across the whole country.

1108
01:34:04,557 --> 01:34:05,933
<i>People are fighting for you.</i>

1109
01:34:06,392 --> 01:34:08,019
If there was ever a chance, it's now.

1110
01:34:08,227 --> 01:34:09,562
It's not going to last.

1111
01:34:09,729 --> 01:34:12,773
But, like he said,
we're not going to push you.

1112
01:34:13,274 --> 01:34:14,734
I'm ready.

1113
01:34:16,193 --> 01:34:17,903
We're gonna take the castle.

1114
01:34:19,530 --> 01:34:20,990
And we're going in the front door.

1115
01:34:23,701 --> 01:34:26,579
George, I need you to go to Londinium,
gather the lads.

1116
01:34:28,414 --> 01:34:29,457
Where's the Mage?

1117
01:34:30,416 --> 01:34:31,917
She's back at the cave.

1118
01:34:32,084 --> 01:34:33,252
All right.

1119
01:34:33,669 --> 01:34:36,422
<i>Now, when you say
we're going to take the castle,</i>

1120
01:34:37,256 --> 01:34:38,466
what does that mean?

1121
01:34:40,259 --> 01:34:42,019
I thought you said
you weren't gonna push me.

1122
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:46,182
Come on, lads. Chop, chop.

1123
01:35:03,699 --> 01:35:04,700
<i>Blue!</i>

1124
01:35:07,078 --> 01:35:08,120
Blue!

1125
01:35:10,414 --> 01:35:12,333
- Blue!
<i>- Hello!</i>

1126
01:35:14,835 --> 01:35:17,546
You took your time getting here.

1127
01:35:22,802 --> 01:35:25,388
I'm not gonna hear the end of this
from my wife.

1128
01:35:25,805 --> 01:35:27,473
It was my turn to cook tonight.

1129
01:35:28,516 --> 01:35:32,812
I've been sent by His Majesty
to deliver a message.

1130
01:35:36,148 --> 01:35:37,817
Let's think...

1131
01:35:40,486 --> 01:35:43,489
"Be at the castle before dark"

1132
01:35:43,656 --> 01:35:48,077
<i>"if you wanna see the girl and the boy"</i>

1133
01:35:48,494 --> 01:35:49,662
"alive."

1134
01:35:50,788 --> 01:35:52,415
<i>I would love to stay and chat,</i>

1135
01:35:52,915 --> 01:35:55,668
but you do understand the situation

1136
01:35:55,835 --> 01:35:57,378
between me and my wife.

1137
01:36:03,759 --> 01:36:07,513
Anything that you do to me

1138
01:36:08,848 --> 01:36:13,686
will be repaid 10 times in kind.

1139
01:36:16,689 --> 01:36:18,274
Now, you're a big man.

1140
01:36:19,733 --> 01:36:21,444
Now, let's see you move.

1141
01:36:32,496 --> 01:36:33,831
Evening.

1142
01:37:08,908 --> 01:37:10,075
So, where is he?

1143
01:37:10,242 --> 01:37:12,953
He's a day's ride from here.

1144
01:37:13,245 --> 01:37:14,705
<i>As soon as she's safe, he will come.</i>

1145
01:37:15,414 --> 01:37:18,209
He poses no threat to you
without the sword.

1146
01:37:19,251 --> 01:37:20,544
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

1147
01:37:21,295 --> 01:37:25,424
<i>I don't have to remind you
of what will happen if he doesn't come.</i>

1148
01:37:26,717 --> 01:37:28,802
I'll start with the little boy.

1149
01:37:29,470 --> 01:37:31,347
<i>Now, take the girl and go.</i>

1150
01:37:39,772 --> 01:37:43,108
This venom will induce
that which is hidden from you.

1151
01:37:43,275 --> 01:37:46,654
It will show you things
you do not want to see.

1152
01:37:47,071 --> 01:37:49,114
But you'll need its protection.

1153
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:51,492
Hold my hand.

1154
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:00,834
I don't like snakes.

1155
01:38:01,001 --> 01:38:02,962
No one likes snakes.

1156
01:38:10,886 --> 01:38:11,971
<i>Stay with me.</i>

1157
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:17,142
Stay with me.

1158
01:38:23,148 --> 01:38:26,318
You will feel it for a few hours.

1159
01:40:03,791 --> 01:40:04,917
That's far enough.

1160
01:40:07,753 --> 01:40:09,588
Let's get this done quickly, shall we?

1161
01:40:10,297 --> 01:40:11,548
Put him on his knees.

1162
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:14,843
Put him on his knees!

1163
01:41:46,643 --> 01:41:48,187
Go, go, go!

1164
01:42:09,124 --> 01:42:12,044
You know the price.

1165
01:42:24,223 --> 01:42:25,432
Father, what's happening?

1166
01:42:26,183 --> 01:42:27,267
Leave.

1167
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:36,944
Why is there blood on your face?

1168
01:42:40,155 --> 01:42:42,157
What's going on?

1169
01:42:49,665 --> 01:42:51,750
Father, you're scaring me.

1170
01:42:52,417 --> 01:42:53,710
Oh!

1171
01:42:57,923 --> 01:42:59,633
I love you very much.

1172
01:43:36,962 --> 01:43:38,505
<i>Come on!</i>

1173
01:43:43,302 --> 01:43:44,344
Charge!

1174
01:47:20,185 --> 01:47:24,106
You have won, nephew.

1175
01:47:34,074 --> 01:47:37,369
You have won.

1176
01:47:44,209 --> 01:47:47,504
Now, play with me.

1177
01:48:14,030 --> 01:48:15,115
Ah!

1178
01:48:38,138 --> 01:48:39,181
Ah!

1179
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:52,569
I think that sword
belongs to me now.

1180
01:48:59,451 --> 01:49:00,785
Run, son!

1181
01:49:12,672 --> 01:49:14,341
Brother...

1182
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:19,179
I think that sword belongs to me now.

1183
01:49:19,346 --> 01:49:21,348
Whatever price you pay,

1184
01:49:21,514 --> 01:49:23,725
it will be more than you know.

1185
01:49:29,689 --> 01:49:31,900
<i>You don't need to run anymore.</i>

1186
01:49:36,196 --> 01:49:38,490
<i>You don't need to look away.</i>

1187
01:49:50,377 --> 01:49:52,462
<i>The sword is yours, son.</i>

1188
01:49:54,506 --> 01:49:55,507
Take it.

1189
01:50:28,748 --> 01:50:31,543
You wanted to know
what gave me such drive?

1190
01:50:36,715 --> 01:50:37,841
It was you.

1191
01:50:44,180 --> 01:50:45,682
You put me in that brothel.

1192
01:50:54,065 --> 01:50:55,775
You cut me on the streets.

1193
01:51:04,534 --> 01:51:07,162
I am here now because of you.

1194
01:52:04,552 --> 01:52:06,137
You

1195
01:52:06,554 --> 01:52:07,931
created me.

1196
01:52:32,956 --> 01:52:33,957
And, for that,

1197
01:52:34,124 --> 01:52:35,792
I bless you.

1198
01:52:39,963 --> 01:52:42,090
You make sense of the devil.

1199
01:54:10,428 --> 01:54:11,429
<i>Nock!</i>

1200
01:54:14,891 --> 01:54:15,892
Light!

1201
01:54:20,605 --> 01:54:21,856
<i>Ready!</i>

1202
01:54:25,652 --> 01:54:27,237
Loose!

1203
01:54:49,509 --> 01:54:51,302
<i>While I understand
there's been a change</i>

1204
01:54:51,511 --> 01:54:52,971
<i>in the leadership of this nation,</i>

1205
01:54:54,430 --> 01:54:56,724
I am confident that you will still honor
the agreement

1206
01:54:56,891 --> 01:55:00,228
made by your predecessor and my king.

1207
01:55:01,187 --> 01:55:04,440
We expect to leave here
with 10,000 young men as agreed.

1208
01:55:05,525 --> 01:55:06,943
Yeah, I don't think so, mate.

1209
01:55:07,986 --> 01:55:08,987
Excuse me?

1210
01:55:11,906 --> 01:55:13,226
I said, "I don't think so, mate."

1211
01:55:16,744 --> 01:55:19,163
We've been wondering
what you were doing in here.

1212
01:55:20,164 --> 01:55:21,541
I like it.

1213
01:55:23,084 --> 01:55:24,085
What is it?

1214
01:55:25,086 --> 01:55:26,129
<i>Yes, what is it?</i>

1215
01:55:26,296 --> 01:55:28,840
A carousel? Giant wheel of cheese?

1216
01:55:29,007 --> 01:55:30,234
<i>What are you supposed to do with it?</i>

1217
01:55:30,258 --> 01:55:31,259
<i>I know.</i>

1218
01:55:32,093 --> 01:55:33,469
It's a dance floor.

1219
01:55:33,636 --> 01:55:35,471
<i>And once you finish it,</i>

1220
01:55:35,638 --> 01:55:37,283
how are you supposed to get to the middle?

1221
01:55:37,307 --> 01:55:38,907
But how did you get it through the door?

1222
01:55:39,017 --> 01:55:41,019
Did you carry it in?
Or did you roll it in?

1223
01:55:41,477 --> 01:55:42,770
<i>May I remind you,</i>

1224
01:55:43,021 --> 01:55:47,775
a fleet of 3,000 longships controlling
the seas, surrounding your island.

1225
01:55:48,109 --> 01:55:51,738
<i>It would be unwise to displease my king.</i>

1226
01:55:52,238 --> 01:55:53,281
I'm sorry.

1227
01:55:56,868 --> 01:56:00,038
George, Wet Stick, Percy, on your knees.

1228
01:56:01,372 --> 01:56:02,665
Sir Bedivere, if you would?

1229
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:08,212
I'm prepared to extend the deadline
by a week.

1230
01:56:08,379 --> 01:56:09,505
No.

1231
01:56:10,340 --> 01:56:11,799
I mean, I'm sorry.

1232
01:56:11,966 --> 01:56:13,593
You've made a mistake.

1233
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:17,472
You're no longer dealing
with the man you previously met.

1234
01:56:18,473 --> 01:56:22,727
You are addressing England

1235
01:56:23,102 --> 01:56:26,981
<i>and all the subjects
under her king's protection.</i>

1236
01:56:27,148 --> 01:56:29,233
Arise, Sir George.

1237
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:31,069
<i>So you have a choice.</i>

1238
01:56:31,277 --> 01:56:33,946
You can now kneel to England...

1239
01:56:35,365 --> 01:56:37,367
Arise, Sir Tristan.

1240
01:56:37,742 --> 01:56:39,577
...or I'll step off this throne,

1241
01:56:40,411 --> 01:56:43,539
<i>and you can deal with me
as the man you previously met.</i>

1242
01:56:45,375 --> 01:56:46,626
Arise, Sir Percival.

1243
01:56:50,797 --> 01:56:52,382
And we can see how that goes.

1244
01:56:58,930 --> 01:56:59,972
Sir William,

1245
01:57:01,683 --> 01:57:03,017
if you would?

1246
01:57:04,936 --> 01:57:06,104
It would be my honor.

1247
01:57:30,002 --> 01:57:32,130
Well, now that's out the way,

1248
01:57:32,296 --> 01:57:33,381
let's eat.

1249
01:57:37,468 --> 01:57:38,553
<i>Why have enemies,</i>

1250
01:57:39,721 --> 01:57:41,347
<i>when you can have friends?</i>

1251
01:57:46,519 --> 01:57:48,730
Arise, my king.

1252
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:02,243
King Arthur.

1253
01:58:09,917 --> 01:58:11,502
It's a table.

1254
01:58:12,462 --> 01:58:14,088
You sit at it.

1255
01:58:37,612 --> 01:58:41,157
<i>Long live the King! Long live the King!</i>

1255
01:58:42,305 --> 01:59:42,328
