2
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:39,251
They will say that
I have shed innocent blood.

3
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:45,166
What's blood for
if not for shedding?

4
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,837
With my hook for a hand,

5
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,094
I 'll split you
from your groin

6
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,220
to your gullet.

7
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,578
I came for you.

8
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:29,297
it's the scariest story I have
ever heard, and it's totally true.

9
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,259
It happened a few years ago,
near Moses Lake, in Indiana.

10
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,433
Clara was babysitting
for the Johnsons,

11
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,887
and Billy pulls up
on his motorcycle.

12
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,438
Now, she wasn't even
going out with Billy.

13
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:44,232
She was actually going out with
Michael for about six months.

14
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,611
But she always had
the hots for Billy

15
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,030
'cause he was
like a bad boy.

16
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,654
And Michael
was just so nice.

17
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:57,363
So, anyway, she decides
that tonight's the night

18
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,791
that she's gonna give Billy
what she never gave to Michael.

19
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,118
Have you ever
heard of Candyman?

20
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,544
No.

21
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,997
Well, his right hand
is sawn off

22
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,292
and he has a hook jammed
in the bloody stump.

23
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,925
And if you look
in the mirror,

24
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,427
and you say his name
five times,

25
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,848
he'll appear behind you
breathing clown your neck.

26
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,971
You wanna try it?

27
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,314
So Billy began.

28
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,021
He looked in the mirror
and he said...

29
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,731
Candyman.

30
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,295
No one ever
got past four.

31
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,421
Not here.

32
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,385
Go downstairs.

33
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,141
I have a surprise for you.

34
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:09,939
She looked
in the mirror,

35
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,821
and I don't know why,

36
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,240
but she said his name
the last time.

37
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,988
Candyman.

38
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,910
She turned out
the lights---

39
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,743
What he saw turned his
hair white from shock.

40
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,210
Killed her,

41
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:32,837
split her open with his hook,
and then killed the baby, too.

42
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,631
And Billy got away,

43
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,759
but soon after
he went crazy.

44
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,927
My roommate's
boyfriend knows him.

45
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,352
So, when did you
first hear this story?

46
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,188
My friend heard it on the radio.
It's true. Sick, huh?

47
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,024
The babysitter
just roasted the kid,

48
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,075
like it was a turkey
or something.

49
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,827
So, what's the deal?

50
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,831
You guys doing a page on
serial killers or something?

51
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,870
Something like that.

52
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,623
Well, that's it.
We're done.

53
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,170
All right.
Thanks.

54
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,623
No problem.

55
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,083
See ya.
See ya.

56
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,386
See ya.

57
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,637
Seems like they're gettin'
younger every day.

58
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:29,853
Does anybody remember the
craze for the pet baby alligators?

59
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,228
When they got
too large to keep,

60
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,276
people flushed them
down the toilet.

61
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,024
They live
in the sewers now.

62
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,322
Some of them
are 30-feet long.

63
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,024
Where did
this happen?

64
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,780
In Miami.

65
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,658
They went blind and albino
from living in the dark.

66
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,661
Sir, it wasn't
Miami, it was New York.

67
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,617
I read it in the paper.

68
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,911
Oh, well,
then it must be true.

69
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:57,593
Why would Danny and Diane both be
suffering from the same delusion,

70
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,511
in two cities,
over 1,000 miles apart?

71
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,553
Let's face it, folks.

72
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:07,261
There are no alligators
in the sewers.

73
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:11,941
No, it's round the campfire,
it's bedtime stories.

74
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:17,355
See, these stories
are modern, oral folklore.

75
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:22,576
They are the unselfconscious reflection
of the fears of urban society.

76
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,863
That's lunch.

77
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:47,681
The primordial reptile is then transformed
into this monster, right? Why?

78
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,937
Ah, the dashing
professor.

79
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,142
The lovely wife.

80
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,273
Hello.

81
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,025
Helen,
you know everybody?

82
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,822
The créme de la créme.
Harold.

83
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,069
Hi.

84
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,821
Diane, Daniel, Stacey.

85
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,618
Hi.
Hello.

86
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,405
So, keep up
the good work.

87
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,910
Thank you for
the contributions.

88
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,958
Thanks.Bye.
Awesome lecture.

89
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,034
See you.

90
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:15,583
Bye.

91
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:20,875
See ya.

92
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,258
So you wanna tell me
about this girl?

93
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,093
What's her name?
Stacey.

94
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,934
She could barely look me
in the eyes, Trevor,

95
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,265
and I swear
she was blushing.

96
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,769
Well, I guess that's because
she's madly in love with me.

97
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,571
You know, all those bursting
adolescent hormones.

98
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,024
You don't
really think...

99
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,906
No, of course not.

100
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:51,077
Good. I should hope not.
So, what's the matter?

101
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,954
Trevor,

102
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,751
you promised
you wouldn't do

103
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,080
the urban legends lecture
until next semester.

104
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,215
You knew that Bernadette and I were
gathering data from the freshmen,

105
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,544
so why did you have to ruin it?

106
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,219
Honey, you're my wife
and I love you dearly,

107
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,047
but you can't expect me
to hold up their education

108
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,134
while the two of you complete your thesis.
I mean, be realistic.

109
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,638
I have a curriculum
I have to follow here.

110
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,061
Yes, I know.

111
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,639
Well? So don't be
mad at me.

112
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,070
If you look in the mirror

113
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,567
and say his name
five times,

114
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,695
he'll appear behind you
breathing down your neck.

115
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,662
Can I clean the room?

116
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,622
Oh, sure.
Don't mind me.

117
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,252
So Billy began.

118
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,334
He looked in the mirror
and he said...

119
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,012
"Candyman,
Candyman, Candyman... "

120
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,843
Candyman, huh?

121
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,719
Yes, have you heard
of him?

122
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,600
Mmm-hmm.
You doing a study on him?

123
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,691
Yes, I am.
What have you heard?

124
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,487
Everybody's scared of him
once it get dark.

125
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:08,157
He live over at Cabrini.
My friend told me about him.

126
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,530
Cabrini-Green?

127
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,111
Yeah, in the projects.

128
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,447
I live on the South Side, so I
don't know too much about it,

129
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,282
but my friend,
she know all about it.

130
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,584
Her cousin
live at Cabrini.

131
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,208
They say
he killed a lady.

132
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,583
Can I talk
to your friend?

133
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:22,880
Sure.

134
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,504
Kitty?

135
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,055
Yeah?
What do you want?

136
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,554
Lady down here
wanna talk to you.

137
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,343
Au right.

138
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:37,896
She comin'.

139
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,690
I'm Helen Lyle.

140
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,988
Pleased to meet you.
Henrietta Mosely.

141
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,360
And this is Kitty Culver.

142
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,736
Hello.

143
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,739
Tell her what you told
me about the Candyman.

144
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:57,541
All I know was there was some lady
in a tub, and she heard a noise.

145
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,208
Do you remember
her name?

146
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,833
I think her name
was Ruthie Jean.

147
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,255
And she heard this
banging and smashing,

148
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,753
like somebody was tryin'
to make a hole in the wall.

149
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,302
So Ruthie called 911
and she said,

150
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,004
"There's somebody comin'
through the walls."

151
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,215
And they didn't
believe her.

152
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,845
They thought the lady
was crazy, right?

153
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:15,925
Mmm-hmm.

154
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,183
So she called 911 again, and
they still didn't believe her.

155
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,358
But when they finally got
there, she was dead.

156
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,564
Was she shot?

157
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,769
No.

158
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,940
She was killed with a hook.

159
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,319
It's true.

160
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,205
Yeah, it is.
I read it in the papers.

161
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,032
Candyman killed her.

162
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,878
Yeah, but I don't
know nothin' about that.

163
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,307
Helen, this is sick.

164
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,859
This isn't one of your fairytales.
A woman got killed here.

165
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,611
Jesus.

166
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,734
That's not
the half of it.

167
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,233
Now,
that's Cabrini-Green,

168
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,693
not that you'd
recognize it today.

169
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,950
Yeah, no kidding.
I won't even drive past there.

170
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,531
Heard a kid got shot
there the other day.

171
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,911
Every day.

172
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,289
Okay, now look carefully
at this picture.

173
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,792
And then this one.

174
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,755
You spot it?

175
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,470
No.

176
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,308
That's not Cabrini-Green.

177
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,600
That's this building,
Lincoln Village.

178
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,975
My apartment was built
as a housing project.

179
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,435
No.
Yeah.

180
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,696
Now take a look at this.

181
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,750
Once it was finished,
the city soon realized

182
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,829
that there was no barrier between
here and the Gold Coast.

183
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,629
Unlike over there,
where you got the highway

184
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,332
and the "L" train to
keep the ghetto cut off.

185
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,793
Exactly. So they made
some minor alterations.

186
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:58,176
They covered the cinder
block in plaster

187
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,177
and they sold
the lot off as condos.

188
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,300
How much did you pay
for this place?

189
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,511
Don't ask.

190
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,357
Now wait
till you see this.

191
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:12,643
Here's the proof.

192
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:22,613
The killer, or killers,
they don't know which,

193
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,615
smashed their way through
the back of this cabinet.

194
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,541
See, there's
no wall there.

195
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,837
It's only a medicine chest separating
us from the other apartment.

196
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,127
Hey, hey, wait!
What are you doing?

197
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,504
There could be somebody
on the toilet.

198
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,585
No, the apartment's vacant.
Are you sure?

199
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,295
YSS.

200
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,968
There.

201
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,346
Okay. Now take a look.

202
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,639
That is amazing.

203
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,354
What? There's somebody in there.

204
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,400
I saw a light go on.

205
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,228
There's nobody there.

206
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,896
Psych.

207
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,572
That's not funny.
That was not funny.

208
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,905
You didn't
scare me at all.

209
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,531
Yeah, right.

210
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,370
OW.

211
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,995
You don't believe all that
nonsense anyway, do you?

212
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,876
I don't. Do you?

213
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,627
No.

214
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,218
Au right.

215
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,255
Candyman, Candyman,

216
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,887
Candyman, Candyman,

217
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,142
Candyman.

218
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,974
Oh, you chicken!

219
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,735
You have to do it five times.
Go on. Go again.

220
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,811
I'm sorry...

221
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,362
I did if...

222
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:01,886
Trevor?

223
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,147
Oh, Trevor!

224
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,816
What? Who were
you expecting?

225
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,149
What time is it?

226
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,526
It's late,
and I'm smashed.

227
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,576
Sorry I scared you.

228
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,987
What's with the arsenal,
Bernadette?

229
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,280
We're only going
eight blocks.

230
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,529
You're the one who got
us dressed up like cops.

231
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,702
I just said
dress conservatively.

232
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,120
Yeah, well,
we look like cops.

233
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,743
Why are you trying
to scare me?

234
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,449
I'm not trying to
scare you, Helen.

235
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:14,785
I just want you
to think, okay?

236
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,790
The gangs hold this whole
neighborhood hostage.

237
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,297
Okay, let's just turn around then!
Let's just go back,

238
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,094
and we can write a nice
little boring thesis,

239
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,718
regurgitating all the usual
crap about urban legend.

240
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,854
We've got a real
shot here, Bernadette.

241
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,730
An entire community starts attributing
the daily horrors of their lives

242
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,652
to a mythical figure.

243
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,856
Now, if Trevor and Archie
were in on this,

244
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:45,986
do you think
they'd chicken out?

245
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,654
In a second.

246
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,319
Exactly.

247
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,660
 All right.

248
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,402
Yo, G, what's up?
What's up, man?

249
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,454
You wanna
wait here for me?

250
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,126
No.

251
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,495
Well, then let's go.

252
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:47,918
Check them out.

253
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,254
And lock the car.

254
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,134
MAN 1: Hey, now. Whoo!

255
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,220
Want somethin', baby?

256
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,763
I got it for you.

257
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,019
MAN 2: Say, yo, mama.
Come over here, baby. Come on, come on.

258
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,902
Yo, baby.

259
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,904
Which way you goin'?

260
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,231
Just going inside.

261
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,233
Yeah?

262
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,743
Y'all can't come up in here.
-Can't come up in here.

263
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,819
Excuse me, y'all can't
come up in here.

264
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:14,870
Who you lookin' for?

265
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,447
Just going up to
see a friend of ours.

266
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,578
Sure you're
not the police, huh?

267
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,914
Look like Five-O to me.

268
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,830
Ask blondie
where she goin'.

269
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,213
Who she goin' to see?

270
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,336
Who you goin' to see?

271
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,918
Let's take the stairs.
Come on.

272
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,299
Where you all
goin' there?

273
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:40,101
Heads up, people!
Five-O comin' up the back door! Police!

274
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,231
It's okay.
They think we're cops.

275
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,775
They're not
going to follow us.

276
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:52,901
Hang on.

277
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,348
Look at this.

278
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:17,767
Oh, this is great.

279
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,519
"Sweets to..."

280
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:25,562
"The sweet."

281
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,984
"Sweets to the sweet."

282
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,522
Hurry up, Helen.

283
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,278
Let me just
get the door.

284
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,748
Sorry.

285
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:42,825
Jesus, Helen.

286
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,376
Here it is.

287
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,254
Don't go in there.

288
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,962
Come on, come on.

289
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,012
Jesus, it stinks.

290
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,732
See, I was right.
The layout is identical.

291
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,781
Which means that the
bathroom is over there.

292
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:14,857
Helen...

293
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,941
What's the problem?

294
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,323
A woman died in there.
Leave it.

295
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,668
It's all right.
There's nothing to see.

296
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,212
God.

297
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,720
Wait a minute.

298
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,222
This is where he crawled
through, right?

299
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,848
Yeah.

300
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,027
Well, we found it.
Let's go.

301
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,570
Wait a second.

302
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,282
Okay. Hang onto this.

303
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,656
What?

304
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,741
I'm just gonna
go through,

305
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,372
and when I get back,
we're out of here.

306
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,703
You gotta be kidding.

307
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,584
Oh, come on. It's just
a derelict apartment.

308
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,506
What if somebody's
packing drugs in there?

309
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,801
You're just gonna apologize
and give them your card?

310
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,090
Huh?

311
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:19,047
All right.
Let's listen.

312
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,142
There's nobody
in there.

313
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,398
Okay.

314
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,521
But hurry up.
Be careful.

315
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,037
Give me the camera.

316
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,114
You got five minutes.

317
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,783
Okay. Five.

318
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,848
Damn it.

319
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,408

320
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,746
Bernadette! Sorry.

321
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,252
I ran out of film.
I've gotta go back.

322
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,837
No way.
You can't believe what...

323
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,335
No way, Helen.
We're out of here.

324
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,097
Hey, what y'all
doin' in there?

325
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,687
We're just leaving.

326
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:15,230
You here for the sweet?

327
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,352
NO.

328
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,730
We're not cops.

329
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,770
We're from
the university.

330
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,275
Well, you don't
belong here, lady.

331
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,361
You don't belong goin' through
people's apartments and things.

332
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:28,361
My name is Helen Lyle
and this is Bernadette Walsh.

333
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,037
We're doing a thesis,

334
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,786
and we were wondering if we could
just talk to you for a few minutes.

335
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,625
Here. This is my card.

336
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,049
My baby. Come on.

337
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,464
Come on. Let's go.
Come on.

338
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:50,762
You know, whites don't
ever come here,

339
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:53,060
except to
cause us a problem.

340
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,479
Believe me, that's not
what we want to do.

341
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,354
Let's go.

342
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,158
So you say
you're doing a study?

343
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,333
What you gonna say?

344
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,121
That we're bad? Hmm?

345
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,799
We steal?
We gangbang?

346
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,756
We all on drugs, right?

347
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:31,178
We ain't all like them
assholes downstairs, you know.

348
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,597
I just wanna
raise my child good.

349
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,895
He's a beautiful
little boy.

350
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:39,644
He's all I got.

351
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,350
What's his name?

352
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,527
Anthony.

353
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,648
I'm Anne-Marie.

354
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,528
Anne-Marie McCoy.

355
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:53,620
Nice to meet you.

356
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,197
I'm sorry
we disturbed you.

357
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,957
We'll just get out
of your way.

358
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,955
It's okay.

359
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,957
I don't mean
to be rude. it's...

360
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,001
The white folks
that come round here

361
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,675
ain't too handshakin'
with us, you know?

362
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,842
Hey, what you doin'?
Let me help you.

363
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:12,890
Oh.

364
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,642
Making a mess here, huh?

365
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,058
Thank you. Thanks.

366
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,348
You got kids?

367
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,939
No, but I'd love one. Hey.

368
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:28,064
Got my eye on
this one, big time.

369
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,200
Yeah. They're not
gonna get him.

370
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,454
You wanna know
about Ruthie Jean?

371
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,916
They all been here,
you know.

372
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:51,262
Newspapers,
cops, case workers.

373
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,798
They all wanna know.

374
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,934
I heard her screamin'

375
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,101
I heard her right
through the walls.

376
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:07,645
I dialed 911. Nobody came.

377
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,231
Nobody came.

378
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,566
Everybody scared.

379
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,370
He can come right through
these walls, you know?

380
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,081
I'm scared.

381
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,789
Scared for my child.

382
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,956
They ain't never
gonna catch him.

383
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:29,587
WhO?

384
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,756
Candyman.

385
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,224
If they saw something
they liked, they'd point.

386
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,772
They thought
it was rude to point.

387
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,393
What did they do?
They went...

388
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,109
Spat over people.
It's quite extraordinary.

389
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:53,441
Be nice.
I am being nice.

390
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,199
I'm being very nice.

391
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,618
So how are
the two most beautiful

392
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,990
graduate students
getting along, then?

393
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:03,163
Trevor tells me you've been
dabbling in my favorite subject.

394
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,625
Well, I can't wait
to review your data.

395
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,631
I think I can fit you
in tomorrow morning.

396
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,753
We're not ready yet.

397
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:16,672
That's precisely the moment at which
I can be of greatest assistance.

398
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,929
Before you disappear down
a path to academic Bolivia.

399
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,136
I think I've been there.

400
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,981
Actually, Purcell, we're
about to bury you.

401
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:28,768
Helen...
What?

402
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,614
I'm sure we're gonna have something
for you in a week or so.

403
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,487
It's just that we only
went to Cabrini today...

404
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,691
Ah!

405
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:39,745
Cabrini-Green.

406
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,447
Candyman country.

407
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,913
Well, if you're after
the hook man, Helen,

408
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:48,542
you really must read the paper I
wrote about him 10 years ago.

409
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,211
You do know the story,
don't you?

410
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,216
No.

411
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,727
Then how are you
going to bury me?

412
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,900
The legend first
appeared in 1890.

413
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,814
Candyman was
the son of a slave.

414
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,821
His father had amassed
a considerable fortune

415
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,655
from designing a device for
the mass-producing of shoes

416
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,490
after the Civil War.

417
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,497
Candyman had been sent
to all the best schools,

418
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:31,080
and had grown up
in polite society.

419
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,297
He had a prodigious
talent as an artist

420
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:39,213
and was much sought after

421
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:43,676
when it came to the documenting
of one's wealth and position

422
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,761
in society,
in a portrait.

423
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:51,226
It was in
this latter capacity

424
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,106
that he was commissioned
by a wealthy landowner

425
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,938
to capture his daughter's
virginal beauty.

426
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:01,448
Well, of course,
they fell deeply in love,

427
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,620
and she became pregnant.

428
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,285
Poor Candyman.

429
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,299
The father executed
a terrible revenge.

430
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:21,422
He paid a pack of brutal
hooligans to do the deed.

431
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:26,518
They chased Candyman through
the town to Cabrini-Green,

432
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:32,395
where they proceeded to saw off his
right hand with a rusty blade.

433
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,361
And no one came
to his aid.

434
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,571
But this was just the
beginning of his ordeal.

435
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,948
Nearby,
there was an apiary.

436
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:47,702
Dozens of hives
filled with hungry bees.

437
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:53,496
They smashed the hives
and stole the honeycomb,

438
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:57,507
and smeared it over
his prone, naked body.

439
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:03,677
Candyman was stung
to death by the bees.

440
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:08,643
They burned his body
on a giant pyre

441
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,268
and then scattered his ashes
over Cabrini-Green.

442
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,783
Hello.

443
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,909
Anne-Marie ain't in.

444
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:35,829
Are you sure?

445
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,878
Yeah. She said you'd be back.

446
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,759
What's your name?

447
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,677
Jake.

448
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,853
Well, listen, Jake, maybe
you can help me out.

449
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:59,482
I wanted to find out about
that woman who got killed.

450
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,188
Do you know
anything about that?

451
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,232
Her name
was Ruthie Jean.

452
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,117
I don't know nothin'.

453
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:09,075
Did anybody else
talk about it?

454
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,953
You know, it's okay
to talk to me, Jake,

455
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,750
'cause I'm not a cop.

456
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,253
So nobody's
gonna get in trouble.

457
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:28,929
I can't say nothin',
or Candyman'll get me.

458
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,719
Candyman, huh?

459
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,268
You scared of him?

460
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,891
I ain't scared of nobody.

461
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:41,069
But you're crazy
walkin' here on your own.

462
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,530
It ain't
safe around here.

463
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,482
Yeah, I know.

464
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,529
But I don't scare
too easy either, Jake.

465
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,789
You know,
you don't have to tell me.

466
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,161
You could just show me.

467
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:03,585
And if you show me where Candyman
is, I'll make you a promise.

468
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,503
It'll be our secret.

469
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,552
Unless you're too scared.

470
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,236
Somebody building
a bonfire?

471
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,860
Yeah, for the party.

472
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,004
In there.

473
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,465
Candyman's in there?

474
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:52,891
My friend Charlie
says so.

475
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,431
A boy got killed there.

476
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,436
Who was he?

477
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,687
Ain't sure.

478
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,313
Charlie tell me
he was weird.

479
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,437
He was crazy?

480
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,022
No, a retard.

481
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,446
His mom was
in the store.

482
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:14,867
And the boy needed
to go to the bathroom.

483
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,283
His mom was
takin' her time,

484
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,744
choosin' this,
lookin' at that.

485
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,793
So the boy started moanin'.
His mom get mad at him.

486
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:26,000
Sent him
across the street.

487
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,217
His mom was
at the checkout.

488
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,715
She hears
her boy screamin'

489
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,341
Mommy!

490
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:32,889
Mommy!

491
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,550
There's a big tough guy.

492
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,136
He runs over
to check it out.

493
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,557
Come out of there
shakin' and cryin '.

494
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,443
He only been
in there five seconds.

495
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,901
Come out of there and
his hair turned white.

496
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,818
I mean, it turned white,
just like that.

497
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,199
Was the boy murdered?

498
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,279
Worse.

499
00:35:56,363 --> 00:36:00,209
He's lying on the floor in a
pool of blood, holdin' himself.

500
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:06,173
Mommy!

501
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,750
They found it floating
in a toilet.

502
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,878
Can't fix that.
Better off dead.

503
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,973
Did Candyman do this?

504
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,349
Listen, you wait here
for me, okay?

505
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,649
Okay.

506
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,915
Hello?

507
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,864
Candyman.

508
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:22,676
Oh, excuse me.

509
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,057
I'm done here.
I'll just get out of your way.

510
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,403
Listen, I don't want to
interfere with your business.

511
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,356
I'm not a cop.

512
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,447
I'm from the
University of Illinois.

513
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,410
I'll just get out
of your way.

514
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,912
Hey, come on!
Let me go!

515
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,210
Look, you're not
being very smart.

516
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,255
My colleagues know where I am
and they're expecting me back.

517
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,582
Now let me go!

518
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,629
I hear you're lookin'
for Candyman, bitch.

519
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,261
Well, you found him.

520
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:23,036
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

521
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,454
Step back.

522
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,911
Number four, step forward
and say the line.

523
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,917
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

524
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,340
Step back.

525
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:41,384
Number five, step forward
and say the line.

526
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,840
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

527
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,142
Step back.
Take them out.

528
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,323
He's number five.

529
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,900
Good work.

530
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,747
How'd you catch him?

531
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,415
We swept the place.

532
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,458
We start from the top floor
and work our way down.

533
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,083
That way you can
flush them all out.

534
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,130
Whole of Cabrini's
locked down now.

535
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,966
You're very lucky
to be alive, Ms. Lyle.

536
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,880
Did he kill
Ruthie Jean?

537
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,260
No question.

538
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,301
Killed that
poor kid as well.

539
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,353
He ran the Overlords.

540
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,647
Oh, we knew everything
about him.

541
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:34,683
Only reason why we didn't
bring him in before

542
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:37,189
because we couldn't
find anyone to testify.

543
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:42,111
We can't protect them down at
Cabrini-Green, and they knew that.

544
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,034
What about
the little boy, Jake?

545
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,655
We don't need him.
We have you.

546
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,504
Hey, Jake.

547
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,218
Listen, I just wanted to
thank you for saving my life.

548
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,175
I wanna go home.

549
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,051
We'll get you out of
here right away, kid.

550
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,890
You did good.

551
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,517
You said
it was our secret.

552
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:14,931
You lied.

553
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,641
It Still is, Jake.

554
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,268
You won't have to
go to court.

555
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,944
Candyman will get me.

556
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,360
Candyman isn't real.

557
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,201
He's just a story.

558
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:33,624
You know, like Dracula
or Frankenstein.

559
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:38,338
A bad man took his name
so he could scare us.

560
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,420
But now that he's locked up,
everything's gonna be okay.

561
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,003
Candyman ain't real?

562
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:47,885
No.

563
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,934
Hey!

564
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,311
Slow down!

565
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,017
You're supposed to
be the invalid here.

566
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,523
No, it's much better. Look.
See? it's much better today.

567
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,603
Yeah, it looks great.

568
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,981
Come sit down.

569
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,714
You haven't eaten already,
have you?

570
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,166
No, of course not.

571
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,669
Okay, good.

572
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,731
welcome back.

573
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,782
Thanks.
Let me see.

574
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:53,489
I'm so glad you're okay.
I would've totally freaked.

575
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,366
Yeah, but you know what bugs
me about the whole thing?

576
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,952
Two people get brutally murdered
and the cops do nothing.

577
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:00,582
Whereas a white woman goes
in there and gets attacked,

578
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,584
and they lock the place down.
Yeah, I know,

579
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,257
but this was a bad guy.
You got him put away.

580
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,256
That's all that matters.

581
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:10,513
Oh! I've got
a surprise for you.

582
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,635
What?

583
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,182
You're not
gonna believe it.

584
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:16,802
The pictures.
A friend of mine

585
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:20,311
in the photography department
managed to save most of them.

586
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:23,731
I'd written them off.
The camera was smashed.

587
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:25,774
That's not all.

588
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,571
I've been talking
to some publishers,

589
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:31,368
and there's a lot of interest
since you made the local section.

590
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,534
We're gonna be published.

591
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,619
All right. So I'll come over tomorrow
at 9:00, and we'll get started, right?

592
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,582
Yeah.
Okay.

593
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:20,329
Helen.

594
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,457
Yes?

595
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:26,377
Helen.

596
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,847
Who is that?

597
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,056
Who is that?

598
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,102
Helen.

599
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:46,810
I came for you.

600
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,707
Do I know you?

601
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,003
No.

602
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,965
No, but you doubted me.

603
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,052
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

604
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,725
No need to leave yet.

605
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,315
But I'm late.

606
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:30,399
You are not content
with the stories,

607
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:33,322
so I was obliged to come.

608
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:41,831
Be my victim.

609
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,962
Be my victim.

610
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:54,677
I am the writing on the wall,

611
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,175
the whisper in the classroom.

612
00:45:57,797 --> 00:46:01,301
Without these things,
I am nothing.

613
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:05,389
So now, I must
shed innocent blood.

614
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,936
Come with me.

615
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:21,996
NO!

616
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,093
Anthony!

617
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:47,897
No,no!No!No!

618
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,286
Anne-Marie?

619
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:06,491
No!
You bitch! You bitch!

620
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,497
Stay back! Stay back!
Where's my baby?

621
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:10,578
Where's my baby? No!

622
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,459
My baby!

623
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,165
You murderer!

624
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,626
You... No!

625
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:20,095
Stop!
Please, stop! Stop.

626
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:27,144
Now, stop! Stop!

627
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,930
Police! Open up!

628
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,436
All right,
hold it right there!

629
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,434
Back away! Now!

630
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:36,438
Look out, look out!

631
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,206
Remove your sweater.

632
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:05,558
Drop it and
slide it over to me.

633
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,554
Take off your brassiere.

634
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,484
Can I please
take a shower?

635
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:22,067
Oh, God.

636
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,661
Drop it,
slide it over to me.

637
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:31,117
Lift up your arms.

638
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,171
Lift your left breast.

639
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,674
Your right.

640
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,305
Remove your underwear.

641
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:48,260
Can I please speak
with Detective Valento?

642
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,636
Remove your underwear.

643
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,850
Frank.

644
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:05,951
Ms. Lyle,
you're under arrest.

645
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,323
Do you understand?

646
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,909
Please let me explain.

647
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,253
Do you understand?

648
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,082
Yes, but...

649
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:21,463
You have the right
to remain silent.

650
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:23,510
Do you understand?

651
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,806
This is crazy.
I was attacked.

652
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:28,053
Respond to
the question!

653
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,720
I understand.

654
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,974
At approximately
10:00 p.m.,

655
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,650
Anne-Marie McCoy
returned to her apartment.

656
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:42,989
She discovered her dog
with its head cut off.

657
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,608
She cried
for assistance,

658
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,991
at which point you attacked
her with a meat Cleaver.

659
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:52,407
You were still in
possession of this weapon

660
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:55,369
when the arresting
officers came to her aid.

661
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,749
Where's the baby?

662
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,583
I don't know.

663
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:03,626
You're sick.

664
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,434
Before I ask
any further questions,

665
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,933
would you like
to have counsel?

666
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,015
Yes OF no?

667
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:23,229
I would like to make a phone call.

668
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:41,710
I'm sorry,
we can't take your call.

669
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:44,258
Please leave a message
after the tone.

670
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,131
Trevor, are you there?
Pick up.

671
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:52,096
It's an emergency, Trevor.
Pick up the phone!

672
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:57,476
I've been arrested.
I'm at the 18th District.

673
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,436
Can you please
come pick me up?

674
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,485
That's it.

675
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:07,524
Do you know
what time it is?

676
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:09,571
3200 a.m.

677
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:57,205
Oh, God.

678
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,496
There's gotta be
another way out of here.

679
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,870
Cover her face.
Don't say anything.

680
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,330
Just have to
walk to the car.

681
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:06,006
Okay? That's it.

682
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,298
All right.
Here we go.

683
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,968
You'll be fine.
Stick with me.

684
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,797
There she is!
There she is!

685
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,257
Just keep
your head down.

686
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:23,649
All right, people. Back off.
Back off. We have no comment.

687
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:25,522
Absolutely no comment.
Nothing to say.

688
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:28,320
We have absolutely nothing to say!
No comment!

689
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,363
My client has not been
charged with a thing!

690
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:32,491
...some information has indicated

691
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:36,287
that baby Anthony was abducted
and may still be alive.

692
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:38,364
The blood may have
come from the dog.

693
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:41,701
A suspect was released this
morning after questioning,

694
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:45,834
and I guess we'll just have
to follow this one as it...

695
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:50,089
Well, at least they didn't
mention your name. That's good.

696
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:55,180
Now, they haven't
charged you

697
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:57,098
because they think
they'll find the body.

698
00:52:57,758 --> 00:53:00,557
Which means, I'm afraid, they're
shooting for murder one,

699
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,980
but I don't think
they have a chance.

700
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,937
Do you think I did it?

701
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:12,281
No, nobody believes that.

702
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,569
But it's crossed
your mind?

703
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,494
Is there anything,

704
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:24,452
any detail,
however small,

705
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,208
that you can recall
that would help us

706
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,664
substantiate your
version of events?

707
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,334
I blacked out.

708
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:34,512
I don't know
what happened.

709
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:36,551
I just woke up
in that place

710
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,883
and there was
blood everywhere.

711
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,364
Can I get you anything?

712
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,249
Are you sure?

713
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:18,426
Look, honey, I was supposed
to go over to the campus

714
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,552
and pick up some work.

715
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:22,347
I'm concerned about leaving
you alone, though.

716
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:27,021
I'll only be about 20 minutes.
Trevor?

717
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,024
Where were you last night?

718
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:36,023
I was here.
I was fast asleep.

719
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:39,068
I thought you were
with Bernadette.

720
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:45,624
Look, honey,
I'm gonna stand by you.

721
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:49,036
We're gonna get
through this, okay?

722
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,998
I'll be right back.

723
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,289
Believe in me.

724
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,504
Be my victim.

725
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,381
Come on.

726
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,592
Please.

727
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,101
Do you believe in me?

728
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,353
Keep away from me!

729
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:40,935
I have the child.

730
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,904
Allow me to take you, or
he will die in your place.

731
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:48,279
No!

732
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:55,078
Your disbelief destroyed the
faith of my congregation.

733
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:57,827
Without them,
I am nothing.

734
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:00,624
So I was obliged
to come.

735
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:04,083
And now
I must kill you.

736
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,762
Your death will be a tale
to frighten children,

737
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:11,932
to make lovers cling
closer in their rapture.

738
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:17,229
Come with me
and be immortal.

739
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:32,823
Helen?

740
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,418
Bernadette.

741
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:45,382
Bernadette, go.

742
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:47,380
Helen?

743
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:51,304
Helen, honey, it's...

744
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:53,636
He's here.

745
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,023
Bernadette.

746
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:06,649
Go!

747
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:07,900
Helen!

748
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:10,190
Helen?

749
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,275
Go on! Get out!

750
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:15,658
Oh!

751
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:19,207
Oh, no, no, no.

752
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:47,569
Trevor...

753
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:49,359
Trevor, he's here.

754
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:53,822
He's here.
He's here.

755
01:00:58,405 --> 01:01:00,078
Don't let him kill me.

756
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:05,961
Trevor?

757
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:16,013
Trevor!

758
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,602
Trevor. Trevor!

759
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,653
Hey, hey.
Trevor!

760
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:41,490
Take her outside.

761
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:44,660
Trevor.

762
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:48,045
Hold me,
Trevor, please?

763
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:12,813
Why do you want to live?

764
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:16,742
If you would learn
just a little from me,

765
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,864
you would not beg to live.

766
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,205
I am rumor.

767
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,159
It is a blessed condition,
believe me.

768
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:28,586
To be whispered about
at street corners.

769
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:33,714
To live in other people 's
dreams, but not to have to be.

770
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,921
Do you understand?

771
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:07,750
Please, God,
don't let him kill the baby.

772
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:35,694
Trevor!

773
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,156
Trevor?

774
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:43,328
Trevor!

775
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:01,171
Where are you going?

776
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:03,594
No, you can't
leave me here!

777
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:06,597
I can't defend myself!

778
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:28,998
No.

779
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,086
What do the good know,

780
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:37,712
except what the bad teach
them by their excesses.

781
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,213
Murderer.

782
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:41,674
Allow me
at least a kiss.

783
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:46,054
Just one exquisite kiss.

784
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:48,469
Murderer!

785
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:49,969
Help!

786
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:52,264
Listen,
he's under the bed!

787
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:56,396
Bring me 1,000 mills.

788
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:59,229
Listen. He's here.
He's under the bed!

789
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:01,531
No. Don't

790
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:07,722
She's coming around.
Morning.

791
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:10,470
I'd like to speak
to my husband.

792
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:13,136
So would I.

793
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,185
There we go.
What time is it?

794
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:17,981
Where are we going?

795
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:19,730
We're going
to Disneyland.

796
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:35,037
Clyde, open it up.

797
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:38,206
Winley?
Clyde, open it up.

798
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:41,710
What the hell are you
all doing back there, huh?

799
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,666
A little reading? Huh?

800
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:45,923
Freak.

801
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,258
Dr. Burke?
-Yes.

802
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:58,936
Ms. Lyle,
I'm Dr. Burke.

803
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:10,990
I'd like to speak
to my husband.

804
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:12,412
I'm sure we can
arrange a visit.

805
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:14,455
A Visit?

806
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,117
Have I been committed?

807
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:25,509
Do you really think these
restraints are necessary?

808
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:30,513
Helen,

809
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:35,510
this is a writ of detention from
the state attorney's office.

810
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:38,521
Now, for the past month...
Month?

811
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:39,977
YSS.

812
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,440
We've been stabilizing you on
a heavy dosage of Thorazine.

813
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:47,363
You probably remember
very little, or nothing.

814
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:49,695
Get me my attorney.

815
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:52,327
I'm working
for your defense.

816
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:55,746
We have to assess your
ability to stand trial.

817
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:58,575
Helen,

818
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:01,628
you've been charged
with first-degree murder.

819
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:12,839
Why don't you tell me what
happened in your apartment?

820
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:46,798
The night
you were admitted,

821
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:48,875
did the killer
appear to you?

822
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,928
Murderer! Murderer!

823
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:55,049
Murderer! Help me!

824
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:00,811
He's here!
He's under the bed!

825
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:05,645
I don't understand.

826
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:08,729
Help! Please!
He's here!

827
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:13,066
Help me!
Help me! Please!

828
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:15,948
He's under the bed.
He's under the bed...

829
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:17,404
That's not possible.

830
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:18,996
Bring me 1,000 mills.

831
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,371
Bernadette.

832
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,641
I'm not capable of that.

833
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:47,150
No matter
what's going wrong,

834
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:52,197
I know one thing.
That no part of me,

835
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:54,365
no matter how hidden,

836
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,283
is capable of that.

837
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:04,166
I can prove it.

838
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:06,331
H ow?

839
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:10,339
I can call him.

840
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:24,972
Candyman, Candyman,

841
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:28,441
Candyman, Candyman,

842
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:40,699
Candyman.

843
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:17,440
You're mine now.

844
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:23,412
Tonight our congregation
shall witness a new miracle.

845
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:44,217
Dr. Burke?

846
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,314
Dr. Burke!

847
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:54,769
Dr. Burke,
please answer.

848
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:31,022
Code nine,
Ward B-5, stat.

849
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:34,559
Code nine,
Ward B-5, stat.

850
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:39,234
Check the west wing!

851
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,817
All clear!
Right!

852
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:44,611
Let's go! Go, go!

853
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,409
We have a direction
on this one?

854
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:14,941
Please be home, Trevor.
Please be home.

855
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:14,750
Get out of my home.

856
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,293
Trevor!

857
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:20,919
What's the matter,
sweetie pie?

858
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:23,547
Did you make
another little boo-boo?

859
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:26,379
What are you doing here?

860
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:29,549
I live here. Remember?

861
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,268
Call the hospital.

862
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:37,431
Don't touch the phone.

863
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:53,906
What's the matter,
Trevor?

864
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:57,748
Scared of something?

865
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:12,174
I hate the color scheme.

866
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:18,013
What were you
gonna do, Trevor?

867
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:20,020
Wait till I got out
before you told me?

868
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:21,517
Helen.

869
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:26,234
You knew I was never
coming out, didn't you?

870
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:30,656
I think we should
call the hospital.

871
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:34,204
Okay.

872
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:38,951
Go on.

873
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:44,123
Is that what
you wanna do?

874
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,135
Call them.

875
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:15,704
I'm not a murderer.

876
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:19,250
I'm not...

877
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:23,667
Trevor, you were all
I had left.

878
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:47,862
it's over.

879
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:03,461
If you'd like to make
a call, please hang up and try again.

880
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:27,356
They will all abandon you.

881
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:42,993
All you have left
is my desire for you.

882
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:34,015
Helen.

883
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:39,235
You came to me.

884
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:42,732
The child...

885
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:47,240
We had a deal.

886
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:49,242
Surrender to me now,

887
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:53,076
and he shall be unharmed.

888
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:06,930
We have a bargain.

889
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:08,507
And I'm afraid.

890
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:12,140
Do you fear the pain,
or what is beyond?

891
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:13,266
Both.

892
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:17,395
The pain, I can assure
you, will be exquisite.

893
01:22:17,474 --> 01:22:20,353
As for our deaths, there
is nothing to fear.

894
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:25,942
Our names will be written
on a thousand walls,

895
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:30,495
our crimes told and retold
by our faithful believers.

896
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:35,209
We shall die together
in front of their very eyes

897
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:39,164
and give them something
to be haunted by.

898
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:43,584
Come with me

899
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:45,419
and be immortal.

900
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:01,189
No!

901
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:36,770
You're mine now.

902
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:40,937
It's time for
a new miracle.

903
01:25:02,723 --> 01:25:06,102
It was always you, Helen.

904
01:25:06,184 --> 01:25:07,857
It was always you.

905
01:26:25,138 --> 01:26:26,811
He's here.

906
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,427
I'm coming.

907
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:10,396
it's okay.

908
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:11,647
Check it out, man.

909
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:16,773
YSS.

910
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:20,409
What happened?

911
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:21,577
They got
Candyman out there!

912
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:25,749
Candyman's in there!
I saw him go in there! I saw his hook!

913
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:29,624
The Candyman's in there!
I saw his hook!

914
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,843
I knew you'd come.

915
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:40,088
Burn him.

916
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:46,933
Hush.

917
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:49,014
Burn him! Burn him!

918
01:27:57,189 --> 01:27:58,816
Help! Help!

919
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:04,246
Help! Help me!

920
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:09,751
You lied to me!

921
01:28:10,827 --> 01:28:14,502
We must be on
our way now, you and I.

922
01:28:14,581 --> 01:28:17,505
Our bones will
soon be ashes,

923
01:28:17,584 --> 01:28:20,508
and we shall never
be separated again.

924
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:22,639
Let me go.

925
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:26,970
I cannot
We are already dead.

926
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:14,274
Come back to me!

927
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:27,037
Come back!

928
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:40,189
We commend to Almighty
God, our sister, Helen,

929
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:42,566
and we commit her body
to the ground.

930
01:30:42,646 --> 01:30:46,742
Earth to earth, ashes
to ashes, dust to dust.

931
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:50,579
The Lord bless her and keep
her and give her peace.

932
01:30:51,988 --> 01:30:53,285
God of holiness
and power,

933
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:56,585
accept our prayers, on behalf
of your servant, Helen.

934
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:58,419
Do not count her deeds
against her,

935
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:02,090
for in her heart she
desired to do your will.

936
01:31:02,207 --> 01:31:06,587
May Almighty God bless you, the
Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

937
01:31:15,845 --> 01:31:17,722
My God.
Look at that.

938
01:31:20,392 --> 01:31:21,894
Trevor?

939
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:37,977
Trevor?

940
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:41,014
What is it?

941
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:43,813
Trevor,
are you all right?

942
01:32:43,892 --> 01:32:45,690
Yeah, I'm fine.

943
01:32:47,687 --> 01:32:49,360
Aren't you hungry?

944
01:32:51,316 --> 01:32:53,535
No, I'm okay.
I'll eat a little bit later.

945
01:32:54,277 --> 01:32:56,700
I was gonna make us
a nice dinner.

946
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:58,490
Okay. Whatever.

947
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:45,704
Hey, why don't you help
me make the salad?

948
01:33:46,663 --> 01:33:49,007
Okay. I'll be there
in a minute.

949
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:00,472
Helen.

950
01:34:10,562 --> 01:34:12,360
Oh, Helen.

951
01:34:17,569 --> 01:34:18,821
Helen.

952
01:34:25,076 --> 01:34:26,248
Helen.

953
01:34:33,042 --> 01:34:34,214
Helen.

954
01:34:35,712 --> 01:34:36,759
OW.

955
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,895
What's the matter,
Trevor?

956
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:45,764
Scared of something?

957
01:34:56,399 --> 01:34:57,696
Trevor?

958
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:00,153
My God, Trevor?

959
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:02,622
Trevor?

960
01:35:03,781 --> 01:35:05,124
Trevor?

960
01:35:06,305 --> 01:36:06,729
