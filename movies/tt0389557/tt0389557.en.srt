2
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,560
We will now make a short stop
in what is called a kibbutz.

3
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,160
Be back in the bus in 15 minutes.
Enjoy your visit.

4
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,840
(Ronnie) I'll make a photograph.

5
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,680
You are disturbing the lesson.
You may watch, but not make pictures.

6
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,840
I speak hebrew.
But you speak dutch?

7
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,720
Aren't you Ellis de Vries
from The Hague?

8
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,919
Ronnie?

9
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,519
El... What are you doing here?

10
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,439
I live here, this is my country.
-Are you jewish?

11
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,799
What are you doing in Israel?
accompanying my husband.

12
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,759
Him, with that collar.

13
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,760
George. He suddenly 'got religion'.
Because of the war, the doctor says.

14
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,440
So:a lot of Jesus and no sins like that.
It's nice and quiet at night.

15
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,479
The last man i saw you with,
wasn't he a Canadian

16
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,480
That's him .
That's my Canadian.

17
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,960
George. A friend from Holland,
from the war.

18
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,879
How the hell did you end up here?

19
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,880
Next stop is Kapernaum.

20
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,240
This is where Jesus performed his
first healing miracle.

21
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,640
Bye sweetheart. I'll write.
I'll send pictures. Bye Ellis.

22
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,479
Rachel Rosenthal.
I am married.

23
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,679
Write down, Rachel Rosenthal
Address?

24
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,680
De kibbutz Stein.
-Shalom.That's what it's called isn't Shalom?

25
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Shalom-

26
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,480
And Jesus said..
Light of the world...

27
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,440
light of life...

28
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Jantje. Stientje. You're up today.

29
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,240
Good morning, mrs. Tjepkema.
Good morning, children.

30
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,559
Good morning, miss.
-Good morning, Rachel.

31
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,560
We promised not to say Rachel anymore,
remember? Never.

32
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,760
It's clearing up. Tonight
I want the stables clean.

33
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,240
alright, boss.
At your seats, go.

34
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,479
Father, could you do a prayer?

35
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,359
Our guest probably learned
a new text.

36
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,360
Good, close your eyes.

37
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,080
And jesus spoke again to them:
I am the light of the world.

38
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,520
Who will follow me, shall not
walk in darknes...

39
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,520
but will have the light of life.
-Amen.

40
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,959
Amen.

41
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,960
Beautiful, and no slip of the tongue.
Stientje, give her a plate.

42
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,079
If the jews had listened to Jesus...

43
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,080
then they wouldn't have had
all this suffering. Then again...

44
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,679
please begin.

45
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,680
Here.

46
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,160
# feel that way

47
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,560
# the moon is shining,
and that's a good sign

48
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,360
# cling to me closer
and say you'll be mine

49
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,240
Hey, you there, girl.
English music is forbidden.

50
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,159
But not for naked girls

51
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,160
You're not funny. You scared me.
I thought you were a kraut.

52
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,039
How can I make it up to you?

53
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,040
Have me on the boat.

54
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,280
A ciggarette like that,
i'd like as well. -Jawohl.

55
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,840
What's that crazy guy doing?
-Getting rid of ballast, so he can ascend.

56
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,080
Get down.

57
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,520
What are you going to do?
-That's my hideout.

58
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,680
Wait. look: Germans.

59
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,800
You can't go back, come.

60
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,320
(unknown voice)
enjoy your meal, boy.

61
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,280
# so laugh and sing, make love the thing

62
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,359
# be happy while you may

63
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,360
(ROB:) Hey, take it easy, boy.

64
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,840
# there's always one beneath the sun

65
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,280
# who's bound to make you feel that way

66
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,320
That voice on the record...

67
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,520
That's you.
-That was me.

68
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,640
In the old days. Before the war.

69
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,720
First you sing,
then you have to keep your mouth shut.

70
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,799
Here, my dad caught these for us.

71
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,800
That's sweet of him.

72
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,120
Will you light the stove?

73
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,759
Nice thing.
-You can keep it.

74
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,760
Really?
-a souvenir for you who saved me

75
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,840
How sweet.

76
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,719
Thank you.

77
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,720
With a positive side effect.
-What do you mean?

78
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,879
Now I don't have to spit anymore bible texts
to get any food.

79
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,679
Ssshhhh..

80
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,680
A car.
It's a gasoline engine.

81
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,160
Miss Stein?

82
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Rachel Stein?

83
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,799
I know you're here.

84
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,800
The germans have found your pass
at the burnt out farm.

85
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Helmsman Maalderink, the krauts know
you were in the neighbourhood.

86
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,720
They wrote down the number of your sail.

87
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,999
Says who?
-Come on.

88
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,999
one plus one is two, even for the krauts.

89
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,919
a hidden jewish woman
dissappears...

90
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,920
...and the only sailor around to
help is you.

91
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,999
What are you doing here?
-To warn you.

92
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Soon the SD will come and arrest her
for transport to Poland.

93
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,680
And you and your family, will be
put in jail, for aiding jews.

94
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,719
How did this news reach you?

95
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,439
The police report of the krauts landed
in the hands of the The Hague police.

96
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,440
They  gave it to us.
-Us? Who's us?

97
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,800
Us are us. Be happy, that there's so
many good cops, in Holland.

98
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,600
I wanted to tell you one thing.
Hide. NOW.

99
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,480
Good night.

100
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,880
Wasn't I clear enough?
-You have to help me and Rob to go into hiding.

101
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,600
With 'us' you mean the resistance. You're
with them. So you can help us, right?

102
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,760
Maybe yes, but it's dangerous.
-We'll take that risk.

103
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,040
Please don't let us down.
Please?

104
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,080
There's an escape route, through the Biesbosch.
I can get you to liberated territory.

105
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,519
Cross country, NOW?
That's madness

106
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,839
In a few weeks the tommy's will
be here and Holland will be liberated

107
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,840
Your Tommy's have been cut
to pieces at Arnhem

108
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Choose: come with me or,
take care of yourself

109
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,439
Wait. we'll come.

110
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,440
Be ready tomorrow, 2 'o' clock.
I'll pick you up-

111
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,640
Don't bring too much, but make sure
you can hold out for a while.

112
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,560
It's here. I'll wait on the corner.

113
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,279
Yes?
-I'm here for the notary.

114
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,879
I am Rachel Stein.

115
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,639
follow me,
I will check for you.

116
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,080
(Mrs. Smaal:) Wim, there's girl called Stein
here. Do you have a moment?

117
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,600
My husband can see you now.

118
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,159
Smaal.
- Rachel Stein.

119
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,679
My father said, to call for your
aid, whenever I'll be in trouble.

120
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,680
Every young lady, can call
herself Rachel Stein.

121
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,400
My parents and my little brother.

122
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,520
What can I do for you Rachel?

123
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,800
My hideout is blown up.
I have no papers, nothing.

124
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,199
I have a chance to cross
over to liberated area.

125
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,719
Really?
- Yes.

126
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,719
I will be needing money to
live.

127
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,519
How much?

128
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,520
At least enough,
to last me a year.

129
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,400
100 grand?

130
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,280
No, that's impossible.

131
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,880
Half of it?

132
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,640
In dollars and jewels, if possible.
I don't want it to take up too much space.

133
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,800
You'll have to sign the receipt.

134
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I have to justify this to your father
later on.

135
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,199
Do you know where my parents are?

136
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,200
No, I don't know
and I don't want to know.

137
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,399
Where do I sign?
-Here.

138
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,400
Hold on.
You don't want to check first?

139
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,199
No, I trust you.

140
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,200
Rachel, you can't trust someone blindly.
Those times are over.

141
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,999
Checkpoint: Show me you papers.

142
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Van Gein, from the SD,
with a load of arrested jews.

143
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,560
10 pieces

144
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,880
Check. You may continue. Have a good trip.
-Heil Hitler.

145
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Heil Hitler.

146
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,120
Come out.

147
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,159
Let's go.

148
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,879
Rachel. Rachel.

149
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,880
Max. That's my little brother.

150
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,919
We're here too.
-Mum.

151
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,679
my girl.

152
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,680
Sshh.. Be quiet, come, come

153
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,519
How did you get here?
-Throug. him.

154
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,520
He said, you were going to cross.
-Then we wanted to go too.

155
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,919
This is Rob, he helped me.

156
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,920
Hi.

157
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Don't push, be careful, go forward.

158
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,399
Come and sit.

159
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Please, sit.

160
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,600
Hurry up boy.
-He's just had an operation.

161
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,840
4 days ago.
-I'm sorry, I didn't know.

162
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Could you throw away the plank?
-You're not joing us?

163
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,200
No, the skipper will take
it from here.

164
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,320
safe travels

165
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Lady, take that off.
It glows too much in the dark.

166
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,359
I keep it on even in my sleep.

167
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,360
Then move up your collar.
The krauts see everything.

168
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,280
Let's go.

169
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,200
Look: gingerbread. Saved it for a
party. That means now.

170
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,079
What happened to you?

171
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,559
Acute appendix infection.
He almost couldn't join us.

172
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,359
My notary found us doctor
just in time.

173
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,360
He operated him secretly.
-On the kitchen table.

174
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,999
Did mr. Smaal know where you were?

175
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Of course. He gave us the
address of the hideout.

176
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Odd, he kept repeating he
didn't know.

177
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,680
No, careful.

178
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,440
Where was your hideout?
-In the attic of a boring grocer's man

179
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,240
A socialist, but still good.
- but Brussels is better.

180
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,720
Now, we'll never be separated again, right?
-right.

181
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,200
Why are we going east?
-How can you tell?

182
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,400
I used to be helmsman on a big ship.
Before the war.

183
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,840
Before the war I was on the
Holland-America line. I am zigzagging

184
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,480
Excellent.

185
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,480
Get out.
Show me your cargo.

186
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,640
Open up.
- But she's dead.

187
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,319
but it's a very bad disease.
- Typhus.

188
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,320
Open it.

189
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,640
Close it.

190
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,639
Man, I almost choked.

191
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,640
We never get any complaints.

192
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,519
At least a centimetre of space.
Look.

193
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,520
Can't do any wider, otherwise they'll notice.
-No, I mean in the rain.

194
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,680
I could hardly keep my face still.

195
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,600
Come.

196
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,400
You can clean yourself up over there.

197
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,599
Here, use this.

198
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,319
I don't know, how I will ever be
able to thank you.

199
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,320
You could untie these...
Take a hike, Joop.

200
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,640
Instead thank the people
who found you...

201
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,760
for warning us instead of
warning the SD.

202
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,720
We'll paint that.

203
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,920
Dad-

204
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,759
Kuipers.

205
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,559
Ellis de Vries.

206
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,519
You'll get used to the name.
Do you have a good ID?

207
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,520
All fine, dad. More than real.

208
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,039
Yes.

209
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,040
Did you ever do any cooking?
-Yes, i used to at home, kosher.

210
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,600
There's no demand for that anymore.

211
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,999
Sorry.
-You can stay here.

212
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,879
But you'll have to work.

213
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,039
The harder, the better.

214
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,040
Her whole family was murdered,
by the SS.

215
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,560
Some time, we'll get back
to them, Ellis.

216
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,920
Ellis, come here.

217
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,320
We need a substitute.
Could you be a replacement.

218
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,360
Work is work.
-Even if it's dangerous?

219
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,079
What do I have to lose?

220
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,080
Your life.

221
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,119
She'll travel with me tomorrow?
-Yes.

222
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,999
The new courier, Ellis

223
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,439
I am Hans.
-Ellis.

224
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,479
Have a seat.

225
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,480
Ok, everybody knows the procedure.
The group Kuipers handles the technical side.

226
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,879
Hello.
-Hello.

227
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,519
.. we as KP will give cover.

228
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,319
At what time he'll arrive?
-7:30

229
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,239
Wind direction?
-North-north-west.

230
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,719
Then you'll take the lead, Joop:
south-south-east

231
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,959
Red.
-You stay at 200 metres, Kees.

232
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,719
No further: I am not Jesse Owens.

233
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,759
Blue, Kees.
-And I give the signs.

234
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,760
Any further questions?
Then pass on the gin.

235
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,479
And what's my job in this boys club?

236
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,159
You can play my fiancee.
Just kissing around somewhat.

237
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,160
You'll be playing a couple.
So the krauts won't be paying attention.

238
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,320
Just kissing? That's all?

239
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,799
Boys.

240
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,800
To the queen.

241
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,480
To Wilhelmina, Tim.
You old communist.

242
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,640
Cheers.

243
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,520
One minute to go. Let's begin.

244
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,880
Okay, can you take this?

245
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,399
Chocolate.
Haven't had this for 2 years.

246
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,400
Ellis, you'll be carrying this tomorrow. Be
careful, there's radio equipment in there.

247
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,039
Music, nice.
Are we going to swing?

248
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,639
A transmitter receiver.

249
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,239
I am going to plant a microphone in
the head office of the SD.

250
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,240
But that's heavily guarded, right?
-I am a maintenance technician at the phone company.

251
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,120
The krauts need us all the time.
I can walk in and out, no problem.

252
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,280
Everything's prepared. I was
just waiting for this.

253
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,440
Is my stuff in there too?
-Here.

254
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,079
I can't take this across the street.

255
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,479
'Handle with care' it says.

256
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,480
There's still some suitcases left in the office.

257
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,679
Start loading up, guys.

258
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,840
Hands up.
Don't move.

259
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,360
Oh my god, we took 5 lives.
What have we done?

260
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,519
It was them or us, Theo.

261
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,520
Let's load up, we have to leave.
I'll check outside.

262
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,840
Goddamn. He's such a cold one, Hans.

263
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,399
He's a top marksman.
-And if he had missed...

264
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,400
He never misses. Hans was the
best marksman of Pro Patria.

265
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,319
What's that?
-A student shooting club.

266
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,320
THE student marksman club.
Hans, Maarten and me were members.

267
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,839
And we work together for helping the jews.

268
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,999
Hans is great, he'll get you through anything.

269
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
No Kraut to be seen.
They were working on their own.

270
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,799
Take off their uniforms.
We can use everything.

271
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,479
We'll have to them a christian burial.

272
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,480
Oh yeah?
There are lots of deep holes here, Theo.

273
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,880
You can throw'em in there by yourself.

274
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,319
That's my gun. What did you think.

275
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,320
What did you think, I was thinking?

276
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,720
Check. Keep your ID's ready.

277
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
We're in love right?

278
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,560
Well.. here it goes.

279
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,680
Open all suitcases.

280
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,240
I'll shoot. You pull the emergency brake.
Leave the train and run. Can't think of anything else.

281
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,920
Stay away from me, you dirty bastard.

282
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,959
(German:) good day.

283
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,959
Can I help you?
-Thank you.

284
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,519
Heavy, huh?

285
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,520
Beautiful ladies, should not carry
heavy bags.

286
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,800
My records and my phonograph.

287
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,879
Thank you.
- You like music, very much?

288
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,880
That's my job.
I used to be a singer, before the war.

289
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,680
Ellis de Vries.
-Ludwig Mntze

290
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,320
Open your suitcase. Papers.

291
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,679
Exciting?

292
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,680
Very exciting.
For me that is.

293
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,800
Postage stamps.
I loved those as a child.

294
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,440
all those far away countries.
-I collect them since I was six.

295
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,560
Probably why I studied geography.

296
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,279
Inspection.

297
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,280
Can't you see I'm busy?
Move along.

298
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,960
Yes, captain.

299
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,680
Can I look?
I'll be very gentle.

300
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,120
Polski... France...

301
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,039
I always collect the
countries where I am stationed.

302
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,040
First Poland, then France
and now here.

303
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,639
You've stopped with our queen.

304
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,640
The Wilhelmina stamps
from the dutch Indies.

305
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,160
I don't know if I'll
ever get them complete.

306
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,920
Hauptsturmfhrer, over here.

307
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,280
No, these are mine.

308
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,720
I'd be glad to take you home.
So you don't have to carry them.

309
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,960
That's not necessary.
I am being picked up. Thank you very much.

310
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,040
Maybe I'll see you around.

311
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,960
I'd like that.
Good bye.

312
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,640
You flirt very easy.
Yes, well men...

313
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,199
Mntze, he's called.
Quite a nice guy.

314
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,200
Chief of the SD. Because of him lots
of people of the resistance have died.

315
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,199
And a man like that collects stamps?

316
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,200
If he ever faces the wall after the war,
I'll be glad to say: Fire.

317
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,800
Watch out.
-Sorry.

318
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,160
Look, he found something.

319
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,120
Watch it.

320
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,320
Mr. Gerben, it's our car.

321
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,599
Don't touch that.

322
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,600
Open up. OPEN.
-It's jammed.

323
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,800
Jesus.

324
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,320
They've seen the weapons.

325
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,640
Get out.
Run.

326
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,720
Hey, stop there.

327
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,479
Gerben.
-God damn.

328
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,799
Gerben.

329
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,800
You're too late. They'll get you.
-He's my son.

330
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,960
If they get you, we're all fucked.
You know too much: They'll beat it out of you.

331
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,320
Mr. Kuipers, there's nothing more we can do.

332
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Here, take everything to Silentium.
Ellis, you take the suitcases of the dropping.

333
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,280
Here Hans, call them.
Tell them there's a contamination here.

334
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,360
Thanks to that arse called Mntze,
they now have Tim.

335
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,239
Wait a minute.

336
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,240
Please tell'em the soup kitchen is now closed.

337
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,520
You met this Mntze in the train, right?

338
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,040
And he kinda liked you.
The bastard, adored her.

339
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,039
Oh don't overreact.

340
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,040
He showed me his stamps.
He's collecting Wilhelmina.

341
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,920
(HANS:) the soup kitchen will be closed.

342
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,559
How far, would you be willing to go with him.

343
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,479
How far?

344
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,199
You mean: Sleep with him?
That's a rude way of saying it.

345
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,200
I like things to be clear. Is that
what you mean?

346
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,680
How far would you go?
For Tim. For the others.

347
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,400
As far as Mntze is willing to go. OK?

348
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,799
a deadly sin: A good suit for a dead body,
while everyone else walks in rags.

349
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,519
The customer remains king.
Where did she put the suitcase?

350
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,520
Over there, in the office.

351
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,399
You think of everything.
And that for that fucking kraut.

352
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,959
Go away. This is none of you business.

353
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,960
After the train incident, maybe a little?
No, not even a little.

354
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,079
Alright. I am here for the suitcase.

355
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,080
Over there.

356
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,439
Goddamn. It's soaking wet.

357
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,239
It broke?
-I hope not. It's insuline.

358
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,240
There's a dying need for that.
Imagine a diabetic, without his insuline...

359
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,559
...he can say bye bye.
-Tell me about it.

360
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,039
You have it as well? I never noticed.

361
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,879
No I don't. I am healthy.

362
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,880
Stop watching.

363
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,040
At the revue, there was diabetic comedian.
He always injected before a performance.

364
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,920
Then he had to eat a lot of chocolate, if he injected too
much. A never ending bother.

365
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,199
Yes, but still better than dying of pain.

366
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,200
British bastards.
At least half of it is broken.

367
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,920
The hospital will be happy with that.

368
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,360
Don't ask,
so I can't give away any secrets.

369
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,800
It stings, doctor.
It stings, It stings, It stings,

370
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,960
Shall the doctor have a look at it?

371
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,360
So I am still the first one.

372
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,520
Yes?

373
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,800
Wim, the girl is here again.
This time she looks like Jean Harlow.

374
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,999
Rachel. You're back?

375
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,759
We never got any further than the Biesbosch.

376
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,760
And your parents and Max...
They joined you didn't they?

377
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,320
Suddenly there was a patrol boat of the
krauts and..

378
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,200
Stupid coincedence

379
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,640
Strange. Everybody's dead and
I can't cry for them.

380
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,520
Who fared you over?
-A skipper. Also dead, I think.

381
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,360
But someone brought you to
the Biesbosch, right?

382
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,879
A man from the underground.

383
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,839
Who was that?

384
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,840
van Gein, he was called I think.

385
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,240
Disgusting. My sympathies.

386
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,760
I am supposed to work for queen and country

387
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,760
... by getting friendly with a high ranking SD-Officer.

388
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,599
maybe even sleep with him.

389
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,600
You're on your own with that.
Can't help you with that.

390
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,960
No.

391
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,240
But maybe there's something in here,
that can help me.

392
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,759
I am here to see captain Mntze

393
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,439
really and why?

394
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,440
It's about the royal house.
Queen Wilhelmina in person.

395
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,760
send her to captain Mntze

396
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,840
You are being expected. Wait over there.

397
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,159
Ms. de Vries..

398
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,160
What a surprise. To what
do I owe the pleasure?

399
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,280
I have family in the dutch Indies.
They always wrote.

400
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,320
My mother kept the letters.
I have softened the stamps off for you.

401
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,800
with steam.

402
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,160
Amazing.

403
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,479
beautiful, very nice.

404
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,399
Good day.

405
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,400
Put it over there, Ronnie. I don't
want to damage these lovely stamps.

406
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,400
Shall I serve you?
-No don't bother, I'll do that.

407
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,319
Take some of the chocolate.
British.

408
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,320
We got them by chance.

409
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,760
Take some.

410
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,559
What were you planning
to do with these stamps.

411
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,560
Nothing special, they were
in a drawer in my place.

412
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,480
Almost all the Wilhelmina stamps
I don't have

413
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,640
If you see anything of
interest, take it.

414
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,960
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

415
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,600
Yes.

416
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,600
close the door.

417
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,719
Captain, your car is ready.

418
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,720
Already?
Take my hat and coat please.

419
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,120
Too bad, duty calls.
I haven't been able to choose yet.

420
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,560
Then I'll leave them here.

421
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,360
Thank you.

422
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,920
I think I ate too much chocolate.
Is that bad?

423
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,119
I don't get it everyday.

424
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,120
I have to go to a party.
There will be much more to eat there.

425
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,240
What if you could go home and pick up
your phonograph and records and join me?

426
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,519
How about I sing?

427
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,520
Even better.

428
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,480
Without the SD from The Hague.
All our successes had not been possible.

429
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,440
Your fight against the terrorists
is our fight.

430
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,880
With the Fhrer we fight
for a free europe.

431
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,719
Heil Hitler.

432
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,720
Heil Hitler.

433
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,360
And now music. Franken.

434
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,840
# die Fahne hoch
die Reihen fest sind geschIossen

435
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,160
# SA marschiert
mit ruhig festem Schritt

436
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,200
# Kam'raden, die Rotfront
und Reaktion erschossen

437
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
# marschier'n im Geist
in unser'n Reihen mit

438
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,840
# Kam'raden, die Rotfront
und Reaktion erschossen

439
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,880
# marschier'n im Geist
in unser'n Reihen mit

440
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,440
Ms. de Vries?

441
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,879
Everything OK?

442
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,880
The champagne didn't go down well.

443
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,679
I am not used to any alcohol anymore.

444
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,680
But, I'm alright now.

445
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,840
Shall I sing some?

446
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,480
General, ladies and gentlemen...

447
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,320
It is my great honour to present
you Ellis de Vries.

448
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,840
She will sing some for us.

449
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,039
Any requests.

450
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,319
Lola. Die fesche Lola.

451
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,319
Yes, Lola, Lola

452
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,639
# ich bin die fesche Lola

453
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,640
# der Liebling der Saison. ich hab'ein
Pianola. zu Haus in mein'm Salon.

454
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,360
# ich bin die fesche Lola
mich liebt ein jeder Mann

455
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,240
# doch an mein Pianola
da lass ich keinen 'ran

456
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,720
Lola, Lola

457
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,040
# ich bin die fesche Lola
der Liebling der Saison

458
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,720
Ich hab'ein
Pianola. zu Haus in mein'm Salon.

459
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,400
# und wer mich will begleiten
da d'runten aus dem Saal

460
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,480
# den hau ich auf der Saiten
und treff'ihn aufs Pedal

461
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Lola.

462
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,160
bye

463
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,479
so?

464
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,639
so what?

465
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,640
I'd like to see your stamps.

466
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,639
There's quite many of them.

467
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,640
I have lots of time.

468
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,440
I don't have any toothbrush for you.

469
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:02,080
brushed.

470
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,999
Not bad.

471
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
from the capitalists, we
kicked out.

472
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,400
the loot is for the winners.

473
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,080
exactly.

474
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,399
You sing well.
Where did you sing.

475
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,400
In Berlin.
Cabaret, revue.

476
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,479
You should
have continued.

477
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,480
There is no need for that anymore now.

478
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,600
Your hair is normally black.

479
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,760
Blond is fashion now.

480
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,280
Or this fashion, will help you survive,
for instance if you are a jew.

481
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,720
So what?

482
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,960
Are these jewish?

483
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,160
Are these jewish?

484
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,960
Also blond.
A perfectionist

485
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,280
Oh, sorry.
Come on in. girls are allowed.

486
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,160
Do you also have to pee, after sex?
You were really great tonight.

487
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,799
Did he hire you, Mntze?
You came looking for a job, right?

488
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,800
No, but I am searching for one.
But I am no party (NSB) member

489
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,320
Neither am I, although I
do agree with them.

490
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,079
Holland is after all a piece of Germany.

491
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,080
We all speak a sort of german dialect.

492
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,159
Oh, nice: real soap.

493
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,160
And good food and great drinks.
What more do you want?

494
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,319
(FRANKEN:) Ronnie?

495
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,079
Make sure, a high ranked kraut
never gets enough of you.

496
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,080
Gnther. Over here.
-Ronnie?

497
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,640
Are you playing with each other?

498
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:09,040
We were talking about work.
Ellis would like to work for us.

499
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,320
Someone who sings such good german
is hired right away.

500
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,520
That is if...

501
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,560
you pass the inspection.

502
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,920
If that isn't healthy, I don't know what is...

503
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,440
NO, NO, these are reserved for
captain Mntze.

504
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,080
Where were you?
On the toilet.

505
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,639
Franken offered me a job.

506
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,640
Good idea. You can start helping with
the Fhrer's birthday tomorrow.

507
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,480
You're married, I see.
Nice kids you have.

508
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,680
Was. I was married.

509
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,560
Not anymore?

510
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
NO, not anymore.

511
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,599
Gצhring, had sworn...

512
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,600
... that no english bomb would
fall on Germany.

513
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,160
Christina, was with the children in
the wrong hideout.

514
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,520
And I wasn't there.

515
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,760
bulls eye.

516
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,680
To not have anything, Ellis...
Isn't much.

517
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,600
I know.

518
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,240
For you it must be a
beautiful sound.

519
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,720
SShhh...

520
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,959
You haven't told us anything.

521
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,960
I don't know anything. Someone
else put those weapons in the car.

522
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,480
You are just a little piece of shit
on our road to final victory.

523
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,760
In a few weeks, the Russians will throw
you in the sea, along with your executioners.

524
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,439
For you.

525
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,399
And for your comrad Stalin.

526
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,119
Dirty bastard.

527
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,120
What a filthy language.

528
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,280
wash his mouth.

529
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,800
He's holding his breath.

530
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,440
Up

531
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,400
Within the hour you'll talk.

532
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:24,120
Are we here alone?
-The rest fled back to Germany.

533
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:29,120
Could you come and sit here?
So we can sit next to each other.

534
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,319
Type it out
and copy it 15 times.

535
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,919
You have spots on your uniform.

536
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,920
It's nothing, just water.
Hurry up, there will be more to do.

537
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,439
If you read, I'll type.

538
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,440
Let's take these of, with them I can't type.

539
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,639
Are these real?
-Of course, what did you think?

540
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,640
Got it from Gnther. Nice, huh?
His safe is a real treasure hole.

541
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,839
Open Sesame.
-Yes just like that.

542
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,319
There's a whole box full of diamonds.

543
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,199
Right.

544
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,200
Let's see: 1945, 19th.
There we go.

545
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,960
Ellis? You can start.

546
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,639
The terrorist Timotheus Kuipers gave
the following...

547
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:32,559
You can speed up a little bit.

548
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:35,239
...statement.

549
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,599
I am a member of a resistance group.

550
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,600
My father, is head of the group:
Gerben Kuipers.

551
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:46,240
boring, huh.

552
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,960
- Untranslated subtitle -

553
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,600
Ellis?

554
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,359
What are you doing here?

555
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:35,119
To talk with the germans about justice.

556
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,919
Justice, HERE?

557
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,920
People of the resistance have no rights, but
as a lawyer, I try to help them nonetheless.

558
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,360
With a guy like Franken?
A waste of time.

559
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,280
Tim's microphone.

560
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,359
How did you know I was here?

561
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:01,360
I do not underestimate you.

562
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,040
That Mntze guy, is quite nice,
don't you think?

563
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,800
Could you give me a hand? We have to
decorate the hallway for the Fhrer's birthday.

564
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,080
Mr. Smaal, you are here.
Come in.

565
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,560
No the pian should go there.

566
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,999
Some more

567
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Thank you.
-Good bye.

568
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,400
That looks great.

569
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,880
Don't forget to put the Fhrer
in the right perspective.

570
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,520
Give me a spotlight.
-Captain.

571
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,839
the execution order
for the 3 terrorists.

572
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,879
Tomorrow we shoot'em.
just sign here.

573
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,880
Absolutely not.
No one is getting shot.

574
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,679
But they confessed,
they have to be shot.

575
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,319
Fhrer's order, you know that.

576
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,479
Only I am in command here.

577
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:02,480
No executions, if I say so.
Dismissed.

578
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:09,040
Heil Hitler.

579
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,080
Jesus, if even those germans start to
fight among each other, where will it end?

580
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:23,920
To me. Follow me!

581
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:21,440
Ellis?

582
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,560
Ellis?
-I'm coming

583
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,400
What are you doing here?
-To cheer him up.

584
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,160
The nicest one is for you.
-That's sweet. Are you coming with me?

585
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,760
Actually I have to go home.
-So I won't be seeing you tonight?

586
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,480
Of course you will.
I just have to pick up some clothes.

587
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:41,719
Oh Honey..

588
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:44,720
My little animal.

589
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,920
animal.... ahh...

590
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,879
It works.
-Ellis.

591
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,880
Ronnie, Ronnie...
Yes, yes, cum, cum

592
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Jesus, what a horny animal.
-Just a dirty kraut whore.

593
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:09,399
We'll get those after the war.
-Shave'm and then put their heads in tar.

594
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,400
and after that shoot'em.
- come on, don't be so primitive

595
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,959
That's not what we fight for.

596
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,759
Damn, that fucking phone.

597
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,760
Don't stop, keep going.

598
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,760
I almost came, watch it you're dripping.

599
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,800
Franken.
Yes, send him in.

600
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,640
We'll continue tonight. And now go.

601
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,039
Cas.

602
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,119
Good day, how are you?
-fine.

603
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:42,120
Sit down. I still owe you money from last time.

604
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:47,199
What's that?
-He's opening his safe.

605
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,159
There's a new list before you on
your desk.

606
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:53,160
Not many.
Is it still worth it?

607
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,599
Easily half a million.

608
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,600
I think this will be the last ride.

609
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,919
I know that voice.
-Sssshhh...

610
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,279
What?

611
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:05,280
It reminds me of the man who helped us flea.
-Shut up.

612
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,799
Shit, the generator is cutting out.
-I'll fix it.

613
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,800
You can count it.
-Don't have to.

614
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,400
When can you have the
next transport to be ready?

615
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,639
They live close together.
Maybe 3 days?

616
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,640
That's him. That's van Gein.

617
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,960
Those rich jews always come from
the same circles.

618
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:29,079
None of your business

619
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:32,080
If I wanted to, I could find out
who your informant is.

620
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,039
This could cost you your head.

621
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:38,040
Or save mine after the war.

622
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,640
After the war, I won't be here.
Come let's have a drink.

623
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:45,720
To the next load of stupid jews.

624
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,760
So it wasn't a coincedence, that
german boat.

625
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,200
It was a trap. They're just working on a list.

626
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,679
What list?

627
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,680
Jews with money. They promise to take
them to Belgium, but instead they kill them.

628
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:04,160
How do you know?
-Cuz I have been set up to.

629
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,400
Because I have seen my whole
family being slaughtered.

630
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,680
Jesus, Ellis....
That's horrible.

631
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:16,040
Who is this van Gein?
He poses as someone of the resistance.

632
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,640
He tells jews, that they can run for it,
just make sure to bring your money.

633
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,200
Franken, waits for them, kills them
and finally robs them.

634
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:30,520
So now there's a new list of
potential victims.

635
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,559
We cannot let that happen.

636
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:36,560
We don't know who they are,
or where they are.

637
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,240
What if we just kill Franken?
- Yes, stop that bastard.

638
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:44,320
NO, if we kill him, 20-30 hostages
will line up against a wall.

639
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,319
We don't shoot Franken
and 20-30 jews will be killed.

640
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:50,320
Is the life of a random jew, worth
more than a good Dutchman?

641
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:53,560
Who decides that, you?

642
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,319
Franken, will not be liquidated.

643
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,479
Van Gein. We kill him and it ends
as well..

644
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:01,480
No killing.
Mr. Smaal, your call.

645
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,200
On behalf of Gerben, I am
negotiating a truce.

646
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:09,360
We do no more attacks and Mntze
promises not to retaliate. Might work.

647
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:14,080
Ah, so that's why that fight
happened between Franken and Mntze.

648
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,640
Gerben, congratulations.
You saved, your Tim.

649
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,159
Him AND others.
Is that a problem for you?

650
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:25,079
Me? No. If those are the 'good'
Dutchman

651
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:28,080
That's enough, Ellis. Gerben is chief.
If he says no, than it ends there.

652
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,439
Good day to you.

653
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,440
Ellis.

654
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,800
Things are, the way they are.
That microphone of yours, is absolutely brilliant.

655
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,159
Ellis.

656
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:00,160
I agree, with you. We can't let
those jews be slaughtered.

657
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,200
Gerben is also right.
We can't just kill van Gein.

658
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,799
What if he just dissapears?

659
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,279
Franken, will know.
He will have people shot.

660
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,439
Or he thinks, van Gein
has deserted.

661
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,959
After he just promised him
a new list?

662
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,960
Van Gein, is trying to cover up,
for after the war, says so himself.

663
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:20,959
If he disappears, Franken will
think, he just ran.

664
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,960
There's one thing, Kuipers and Smaal
pass by too easy.

665
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,319
Someone has been setting up
jews for a long time.

666
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:29,199
van Gein has a suspect.
He'll have to tell us.

667
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:32,200
If I have to I'll beat it out of him. Come.
I'll round up my boys.

668
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,560
I can't. I'm meeting Mntze.

669
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
You alone, know van Gein's face.
We can't do anything, without you,

670
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,760
-You must be in.

671
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,079
That's him.

672
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:06,080
Let's go.

673
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Give me your shawl.

674
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:49,440
Now.

675
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:25,080
It's empty.

676
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,800
Theo.

677
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:55,119
Shoot. Shoot.
-I can't.

678
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:58,120
Shot.
-I can't

679
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:03,479
Aaahhh.. Goddamn.

680
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,480
Bitch. Goddamn bitch.
I will goddamn....

681
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:12,560
You curse.

682
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,719
Blasphemer.

683
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:18,720
You curse.

684
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,720
That's enough, Theo.
Theo, come!

685
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:41,160
Aarrgghh... Be careful man.

686
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,639
Flesh wound, Kees.
You got lucky.

687
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,640
The bullit must come out though.
Ellis, take the chlorophorm.

688
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:08,560
Breathe deeply, Kees.
Yes, like that.

689
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,840
Oh God, that shit
doesn't work, you dick!

690
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,840
Expriry date 1941.
Jessus, that stuff is way over due.

691
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:30,960
That's why van Gein wasn't knocked out.
-What's still good after 5 years of krauts?

692
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,760
Choice: Hit by the hammer, or
some booze and bite your teeth.

693
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:39,040
Booze, dick.

694
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,839
Cheers.
-Cheers.

695
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,840
Kees, think of something nice.

696
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,839
OK

697
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:02,320
Gotcha.

698
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,959
Thanks, dick.

699
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,960
Guys, cheers on a happy ending.

700
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,879
van Gein delivered the krauts tons.

701
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,880
Tons?
You mean millions.

702
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,359
Come on Theo.

703
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:19,360
Damn those dutchmen.
They killed my best soldier.

704
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:24,400
That brave warrior and comrad,
handed me millions.

705
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
And now he's dead, shot by
god damn terrorists.

706
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,119
I shot a man. I am bad.

707
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:38,120
That was justice.
He's a murderer, you are not.

708
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:41,680
Yes I am. I am just as bad as the nazi's.

709
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,400
I said no, didn't I? I said god damn No,
didn't I?

710
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,159
The bastard had to die.
Besides, what does it matter?

711
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,799
That Tim, will face the firing squad. Dick.

712
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,800
Along with 40 other hostages.

713
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:04,400
Because you as a resistance hero,
had to go and shoot van Gein.

714
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,919
Jesus, Gerben. 40?
How do you know?

715
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,920
From the microphone we placed
on Franken.

716
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:16,960
His best man killed.
He wants blood.

717
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,759
You still negotiate with Mntze?

718
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,759
Not after the attack you pulled.

719
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:25,760
Tim is as good as dead.

720
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:29,080
But your jews are saved...

721
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:33,440
Ellis, no. I am responsible.
No one else.

722
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,880
I am turning myself in.
Only I shall face the firing squad.

723
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,759
I will be beside you, Hans.
I carry most of the guilt.

724
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:45,760
I will join too.
- Then we all go.

725
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:50,720
Stop it, this is ridiculous.
You're all drunk.

726
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,640
Before you know it, all of the resistance
will give up, because of gin.

727
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,920
Turning in, is not a solution.
- Then what is?

728
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,799
Rescue them.

729
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,800
You will not get out alive of the
SD basement.

730
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,480
The building plans of the SD office,
when it was still a bank.

731
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:19,080
Got it from a friend

732
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:24,679
Here I am.

733
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,399
I thought:
she's not coming back.

734
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:29,400
I lost track of time at home.

735
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:33,440
And then it was curfew and I had
to sneak my way in.

736
01:16:34,305 --> 01:17:34,612
