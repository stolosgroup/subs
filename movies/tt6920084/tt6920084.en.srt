3
00:01:24,278 --> 00:01:27,406
<i>No, thanks. If I want to look at pictures,
I go to Fotomat.</i>

4
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:31,243
<i>Besides, Rose brought me.
She's waiting outside with the dog.</i>

5
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:34,580
<i>Hey, you ever stick your head
out of a car window doing 50?</i>

6
00:01:34,663 --> 00:01:35,831
<i>What a rush.</i>

7
00:02:45,526 --> 00:02:46,610
Friend?

8
00:02:49,655 --> 00:02:50,906
Hello?

9
00:02:54,118 --> 00:02:55,703
What do you want?

10
00:03:10,926 --> 00:03:12,303
She's here again.

11
00:03:14,138 --> 00:03:15,514
She was watching me.

12
00:03:17,558 --> 00:03:20,811
Try and get back to sleep
before Doctor Birkin finds you in my bed.

13
00:03:20,895 --> 00:03:22,146
I saw her.

14
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:23,606
You didn't...

15
00:03:24,231 --> 00:03:25,941
You didn't see anything.

16
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:31,489
You didn't see anything.

17
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:35,159
Close your eyes.

18
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:47,254
<i>What are you, a pervert?</i>

19
00:03:48,547 --> 00:03:52,510
<i>I was married for 45 years,
I never even saw my husband's Gaugins!</i>

20
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,212
Hello?

21
00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:31,942
What's your name?

22
00:05:45,414 --> 00:05:47,333
"Lisa Trevor"?

23
00:05:49,502 --> 00:05:50,836
Do you live here?

24
00:05:54,465 --> 00:05:56,008
Where do you live?

25
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:16,695
"Below"?

26
00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:20,908
Hey.

27
00:06:45,683 --> 00:06:47,601
What are you doing out of bed,
little girl?

28
00:06:49,854 --> 00:06:50,938
Well?

29
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,068
She sleepwalks sometimes
since our parents died.

30
00:07:06,704 --> 00:07:07,663
Well then...

31
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:10,416
Off to bed, both of you.

32
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:13,377
Wait.

33
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:18,007
"Redfield," isn't it?
Chris and Claire Redfield?

34
00:07:19,884 --> 00:07:22,803
You're a good boy
for taking such care of your sister.

35
00:07:25,014 --> 00:07:26,182
Good night.

36
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:00,090
Good night.

37
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,265
That must've been quite some dream.

38
00:08:55,354 --> 00:08:57,898
I almost shit my goddamn pants.

39
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:00,442
If I knew
you'd be screaming in your sleep,

40
00:09:00,526 --> 00:09:02,361
I would've left you
at the side of the road.

41
00:09:08,784 --> 00:09:11,412
What are you doing out hitchhiking
on a night like this anyway?

42
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:13,497
Oh, yeah.

43
00:09:13,581 --> 00:09:16,292
Going to see your brother,
you said. Right.

44
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,377
Used to live here, you said.

45
00:09:20,212 --> 00:09:21,547
Raccoon City.

46
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,800
Better you than me.

47
00:09:24,884 --> 00:09:27,928
You know, one might have nightmares
heading back into that shithole town.

48
00:09:28,012 --> 00:09:30,890
Nothing left except the raccoons
since Umbrella started to leave.

49
00:09:30,973 --> 00:09:32,516
You mind?

50
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,143
You know, you should tell your brother...

51
00:09:34,226 --> 00:09:37,646
"Just get out of there.
Just pack up and leave."

52
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,232
Although,
who you're gonna sell your house to?

53
00:09:40,316 --> 00:09:41,817
Nobody, that's who.

54
00:09:43,194 --> 00:09:45,237
Live in Raccoon?

55
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:47,823
No, thanks. No way.

56
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:50,826
Maybe you wanna stay on till Gatlin.

57
00:09:51,327 --> 00:09:53,120
Tell him you had a change of heart.

58
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:56,415
People put too much emphasis
on family anyway.

59
00:09:56,499 --> 00:09:58,417
–Sometimes, you just gotta let it go.
–Watch out!

60
00:10:00,753 --> 00:10:01,921
Shit!

61
00:10:36,747 --> 00:10:37,915
Is she...?

62
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,044
Oh, no, no, no.

63
00:10:42,128 --> 00:10:43,212
Fuck!

64
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:46,173
I didn't see her.
She came out of nowhere.

65
00:10:46,257 --> 00:10:47,883
What's she doing out here
in the middle of the night?

66
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:49,885
I need something to wrap the body in.

67
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:52,096
You saw it, right? It wasn't my fault.

68
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:54,974
Jesus. Oh, fuck, fuck!

69
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:56,058
Listen to me.

70
00:10:56,142 --> 00:10:58,811
We need something to wrap the body in,
and then we're gonna take it into town.

71
00:10:58,894 --> 00:11:02,565
It wasn't my fault!
Oh, Jesus! Fuck!

72
00:11:07,862 --> 00:11:10,531
–My brother's a cop. He can help us.
–Cop?

73
00:11:10,614 --> 00:11:12,992
But it's not my fault! It's not my fault!

74
00:11:13,075 --> 00:11:14,785
I know. I know.

75
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:16,537
Fuck! Fuck!

76
00:11:19,123 --> 00:11:21,250
We can't just leave her here, okay?

77
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,837
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!

78
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:35,514
Where the fuck did she go?

79
00:11:38,934 --> 00:11:40,019
Hello?

80
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:42,771
Hey!

81
00:11:43,856 --> 00:11:46,025
You've been in an accident
and you need help!

82
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:52,740
We need to go after her.

83
00:11:52,823 --> 00:11:56,285
You can do whatever the fuck you want.
I'm getting the fuck outta here.

84
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,784
Fuck.

85
00:13:33,132 --> 00:13:34,383
Oh, fuck.

86
00:13:44,894 --> 00:13:48,481
Why don't you just take a seat
and leave the poor kid alone, Wesker?

87
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:00,242
Okay.

88
00:14:03,037 --> 00:14:04,038
Ten bucks.

89
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,874
Ten bucks says
you can't shoot that off from here.

90
00:14:11,337 --> 00:14:12,797
Well, that's easy.

91
00:14:14,298 --> 00:14:16,258
Jesus fucking Christ.

92
00:14:18,886 --> 00:14:20,930
With this, Valentine.

93
00:14:22,723 --> 00:14:24,600
I mean, what the fuck?

94
00:14:27,144 --> 00:14:30,689
Twenty says I can knock the bottle
without even looking.

95
00:14:33,192 --> 00:14:35,611
I mean, yeah, sure, I'll take your money.

96
00:14:42,576 --> 00:14:44,286
What the fuck?

97
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:47,998
Fuck.

98
00:14:54,713 --> 00:14:56,257
–Hey.
–You snooze, you lose.

99
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,217
–What...
–It's Jill's sandwich now.

100
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,094
Hey. Oh, God.

101
00:15:01,554 --> 00:15:02,680
Come on.

102
00:15:04,098 --> 00:15:05,307
Pay up.

103
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:07,852
Come on, pay up.

104
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,115
Shit.

105
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:23,784
Fellas.

106
00:15:25,619 --> 00:15:26,996
You back there, Louise?

107
00:15:28,873 --> 00:15:31,667
Hello, boys. What can I get ya?

108
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,752
Two coffees to go.

109
00:15:33,836 --> 00:15:35,963
–Long day?
–Uh–huh.

110
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:40,301
–Hey, could I...
–Oh, you must be the rookie.

111
00:15:43,846 --> 00:15:45,514
How you doin', rookie?

112
00:15:47,266 --> 00:15:49,518
So, I heard...

113
00:15:50,186 --> 00:15:53,272
that you shot your partner in the ass
during training. Is that true?

114
00:15:54,106 --> 00:15:55,566
And that your...

115
00:15:56,275 --> 00:16:01,238
daddy is some big shot on the force
and he had to bail you out.

116
00:16:01,947 --> 00:16:06,243
Now, is that why they transferred you
to this shithole town?

117
00:16:09,163 --> 00:16:11,081
–Yeah.
–Leon S. Kennedy.

118
00:16:11,165 --> 00:16:13,375
What's the "S" stand for? "Stupid"?

119
00:16:14,794 --> 00:16:17,379
Come on, just playing with you, kiddo.

120
00:16:17,963 --> 00:16:19,256
Yeah. Good.

121
00:16:20,132 --> 00:16:21,550
Y'all working the graveyard?

122
00:16:21,634 --> 00:16:23,552
Yep. Where you guys headed?

123
00:16:24,136 --> 00:16:27,723
Well, someone found a body
up at the old Spencer Mansion.

124
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:28,891
It's all chewed up.

125
00:16:28,974 --> 00:16:30,559
Didn't think there was anything
up there anymore.

126
00:16:30,643 --> 00:16:34,104
Well, the sooner they shut this whole town
down, the better, as far as I'm concerned.

127
00:16:34,188 --> 00:16:36,857
Hey, hey.
It's my hometown you're talking about.

128
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:38,567
Well, you're welcome to it.

129
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:41,529
Hey, come on, we gotta shake a leg.

130
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:49,203
And don't shoot. I'm unarmed.

131
00:16:52,331 --> 00:16:54,166
Fuck that guy.

132
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,212
All right. So, I guess I'm paying?

133
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,549
Come on, we should get to the station.

134
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:10,141
Hey. Pay us no mind, we're...

135
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,435
nice people once you get to know us.

136
00:17:15,104 --> 00:17:16,730
I'm Jill Valentine.

137
00:17:16,814 --> 00:17:19,066
Leon Kennedy.

138
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,442
Nice to meet you...

139
00:17:21,026 --> 00:17:22,319
Leon Kennedy.

140
00:17:26,198 --> 00:17:29,410
I wouldn't go there.
She only got eyes for the big fella.

141
00:17:29,492 --> 00:17:31,787
And I don't fancy your chances
against him.

142
00:17:34,665 --> 00:17:36,916
You really shoot your own partner?

143
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:40,921
Yeah. It's a long story.

144
00:17:43,466 --> 00:17:44,758
What's goin' on with your eye?

145
00:17:51,182 --> 00:17:53,851
I don't know, it's been doing that
the last couple of weeks.

146
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:55,936
You don't think you should see someone
about that?

147
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,104
Yeah.

148
00:17:57,855 --> 00:17:59,190
It's probably nothing.

149
00:18:15,372 --> 00:18:16,749
Would you look at that?

150
00:18:53,494 --> 00:18:54,954
Hey, that...

151
00:18:56,205 --> 00:18:57,414
that woman...

152
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,627
that probably just wasn't as bad
as it seemed, right?

153
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,797
Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the ride.

154
00:19:18,978 --> 00:19:20,187
Welcome home.

155
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:29,780
What's goin' on with you?

156
00:19:32,241 --> 00:19:34,285
Don't go getting ill on me,
you son of a bitch.

157
00:19:34,368 --> 00:19:35,995
I don't have insurance for ya.

158
00:19:38,122 --> 00:19:39,248
Fuck!

159
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:42,168
You fuckin' bit me, you motherfucker!

160
00:22:00,931 --> 00:22:03,267
Still pining after Jill, I see.

161
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:05,686
Never gonna happen, bro.

162
00:22:43,516 --> 00:22:45,309
He's been like a father to me.

163
00:22:45,976 --> 00:22:48,103
I see you wax your chest now.

164
00:22:49,271 --> 00:22:50,272
Funny.

165
00:22:52,316 --> 00:22:53,734
After you ran away...

166
00:22:53,818 --> 00:22:56,070
William was the closest thing
I had to family.

167
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:02,493
How'd you get in?

168
00:23:04,036 --> 00:23:04,995
Picked your lock.

169
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,831
–You realize I'm a cop, right?
–Yeah.

170
00:23:07,414 --> 00:23:08,582
You need better security.

171
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:12,169
It's a single–cylinder deadbolt, Claire.
Most people knock.

172
00:23:12,253 --> 00:23:14,421
Yeah, I tried. No one answered.

173
00:23:14,505 --> 00:23:15,798
So you broke in.

174
00:23:16,382 --> 00:23:18,008
Why are you back here?

175
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:20,636
Missed Raccoon City so much
you had to come pay me a visit?

176
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,348
Yeah, I fuckin' love Raccoon City.

177
00:23:24,431 --> 00:23:25,808
"Go, you Bandits."

178
00:23:27,351 --> 00:23:28,936
You're an asshole.

179
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:30,396
No, you know what?

180
00:23:31,313 --> 00:23:34,150
I owe this town,
I owe Birkin and Umbrella everything.

181
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:37,570
They raised me, put me through school,
the academy...

182
00:23:37,653 --> 00:23:38,988
they were there for me.

183
00:23:39,071 --> 00:23:40,114
Where were you?

184
00:23:40,197 --> 00:23:42,324
I haven't even heard from you
in five years.

185
00:23:42,408 --> 00:23:43,534
Nice seein' ya.

186
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:45,870
Chris, wait.

187
00:23:45,953 --> 00:23:49,039
I'm sorry. I'm back now.

188
00:23:52,418 --> 00:23:53,419
Look...

189
00:23:54,044 --> 00:23:56,922
I think there's something seriously wrong
with this place.

190
00:23:57,923 --> 00:23:58,924
What do you mean?

191
00:23:59,008 --> 00:24:02,094
Okay, so, I was hitching a ride
in a truck, and...

192
00:24:02,178 --> 00:24:04,054
Soliciting a ride, also illegal.

193
00:24:04,138 --> 00:24:05,431
Arrest me.

194
00:24:05,514 --> 00:24:09,602
Look, we kinda hit this person,
but they just got up and they walked away.

195
00:24:09,685 --> 00:24:12,188
You hit someone?
Holy shit, Claire. Have you reported it?

196
00:24:12,271 --> 00:24:13,439
I'm reporting it now.

197
00:24:13,522 --> 00:24:16,859
Are you not listening to me?
They just got up and walked off.

198
00:24:16,942 --> 00:24:18,569
You could be party to a hit and run.

199
00:24:18,652 --> 00:24:19,945
Shush. Just...

200
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:22,698
No, Claire, I don't have time for this.

201
00:24:22,781 --> 00:24:25,367
No. Look, okay, so, I've been talking
to this guy in a chatroom...

202
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:27,119
What the fuck's a chatroom?

203
00:24:27,703 --> 00:24:30,331
It's a place on the internet
where people chat.

204
00:24:30,414 --> 00:24:32,208
Just watch it.

205
00:24:33,042 --> 00:24:34,960
His name's Ben Bertolucci.

206
00:24:35,795 --> 00:24:37,505
<i>It's in the water, Claire.</i>

207
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:39,882
<i>It's in the fuckin' water.</i>

208
00:24:42,301 --> 00:24:44,178
<i>This whole town's been poisoned.</i>

209
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:48,182
<i>Slowly, over years and years, and...</i>

210
00:24:48,766 --> 00:24:50,184
<i>people are getting sick.</i>

211
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,521
Come on, Claire. Not again.

212
00:24:53,604 --> 00:24:54,855
–Shh.
–You shh.

213
00:24:54,939 --> 00:25:00,945
<i>See, Umbrella just thought
that they could pack up shop</i>

214
00:25:01,028 --> 00:25:06,826
<i>and let this town rot away
while they go off and start afresh</i>

215
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:09,370
<i>somewhere else, all shiny and new.</i>

216
00:25:09,453 --> 00:25:10,663
<i>And they almost fuckin' did it.</i>

217
00:25:10,746 --> 00:25:13,165
<i>But a couple days ago,
they had a little incident.</i>

218
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:16,710
<i>And I'm not just talking about waste
poisoning the water.</i>

219
00:25:16,794 --> 00:25:19,046
<i>No, I'm talking about a real bad leak.</i>

220
00:25:19,922 --> 00:25:22,133
<i>Like Chernobyl, if you know what I mean.</i>

221
00:25:22,216 --> 00:25:24,552
<i>And they've been trying
to contain that shit,</i>

222
00:25:24,635 --> 00:25:29,014
<i>but the genie is out of the bottle now
and I don't think it's going back in.</i>

223
00:25:32,476 --> 00:25:34,061
<i>I'm afraid, Claire.</i>

224
00:25:34,687 --> 00:25:37,189
<i>I'm afraid of what they're gonna do
to this town...</i>

225
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,900
<i>and the people in it.</i>

226
00:25:44,363 --> 00:25:46,574
I've not been able
to make contact with him since.

227
00:25:46,657 --> 00:25:47,783
Great.

228
00:25:47,867 --> 00:25:50,536
He's crazy and probably dangerous.

229
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:53,956
Look, your conspiracy theories
weren't true when we were kids,

230
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:55,416
they're not true now.

231
00:25:55,499 --> 00:25:57,001
All right? Why are you really here?

232
00:25:57,084 --> 00:25:59,003
Did you lose your job? Do you need cash?

233
00:25:59,086 --> 00:26:00,754
You show up here, you break into my house.

234
00:26:00,838 --> 00:26:03,924
What kind of person
can pick a lock like that?

235
00:26:04,633 --> 00:26:07,261
It's kind of impressive, but also,
what the fuck?

236
00:26:07,344 --> 00:26:09,930
I'm sorry, I gotta get ready for work.

237
00:26:10,014 --> 00:26:11,223
Chris...

238
00:26:15,436 --> 00:26:17,188
Oh, fuck.

239
00:26:24,904 --> 00:26:26,906
Honey, hey, Mom and Dad are here.

240
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:30,493
I saw a monster.

241
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:34,163
Honey, you just had a bad dream.

242
00:26:35,331 --> 00:26:36,499
But I did see him.

243
00:26:36,582 --> 00:26:38,876
He was all green and slimy

244
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:42,171
and he had big yellow eyes
and teeth, like this.

245
00:26:42,254 --> 00:26:44,131
I think I'd be frightened, too.
Right, honey?

246
00:26:44,215 --> 00:26:47,301
–Oh, my gosh, I'd be petrified.
–Terrified.

247
00:26:48,344 --> 00:26:51,639
Come on, it's okay.
I'd never let anything hurt you.

248
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,689
–I'll be right back, okay?
–Okay.

249
00:27:07,196 --> 00:27:08,823
All right,
let's get you back to sleep, okay?

250
00:27:08,906 --> 00:27:10,616
But wait,
what if the monster comes back?

251
00:27:10,699 --> 00:27:11,700
Hello?

252
00:27:11,784 --> 00:27:13,911
Honey, there's no such thing
as monsters, okay?

253
00:27:13,994 --> 00:27:15,746
–Do you promise?
–I promise.

254
00:27:20,835 --> 00:27:24,588
...with really good thoughts.
So let's do that, okay?

255
00:27:24,672 --> 00:27:26,549
Remember last time we went swimming.

256
00:27:26,632 --> 00:27:29,385
Okay? All right? Think about that.

257
00:27:29,468 --> 00:27:32,263
–We need to go.
–What are you talking about?

258
00:27:32,346 --> 00:27:34,431
–Who was on the telephone?
–Now!

259
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:39,103
What is happening, William?

260
00:27:40,354 --> 00:27:44,900
Get Sherry dressed and meet me at the car.

261
00:27:45,734 --> 00:27:48,445
Okay. Hey, look at me, look at me...

262
00:27:52,408 --> 00:27:53,742
<i>This is the Umbrella Corporation.</i>

263
00:27:53,826 --> 00:27:58,038
<i>For your safety, please stay in your homes
and await further instructions.</i>

264
00:28:00,207 --> 00:28:02,084

265
00:28:02,168 --> 00:28:06,046

266
00:28:08,674 --> 00:28:09,758
<i>This is the Umbrella Corporation.</i>

267
00:28:09,842 --> 00:28:10,926
What is that?

268
00:28:13,846 --> 00:28:16,056
It's nothing. It's nothing.
I gotta get to the station.

269
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,475
Here, it's not much.

270
00:28:17,558 --> 00:28:19,226
–What?
–Just take it, okay?

271
00:28:19,977 --> 00:28:21,812
Lock–pick the door behind you
when you leave.

272
00:28:21,896 --> 00:28:24,190
Chris. Chris!

273
00:28:24,273 --> 00:28:26,692
Just get outta here. Okay?

274
00:28:28,736 --> 00:28:30,237
And don't touch the bike!

275
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:36,660
<i>This is the Umbrella Corporation.</i>

276
00:28:36,744 --> 00:28:40,748
<i>For your safety, please stay in your homes

277
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:53,636
Why aren't you sick, big brother?

278
00:29:35,928 --> 00:29:36,929
Can I help you?

279
00:29:53,237 --> 00:29:54,155
Hello?

280
00:30:16,218 --> 00:30:18,345
Hey, do you need help?

281
00:30:20,848 --> 00:30:22,266
You need help.

282
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,651
Itchy tasty!

283
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,186
<i>This is the Umbrella Corporation.</i>

284
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:11,065

285
00:31:19,573 --> 00:31:21,325

00:31:21,408 --> 00:31:25,788
<i>For your safety, please stay in your homes
and await further instructions.</i>

287
00:31:30,835 --> 00:31:33,420
What would the worst way to die be?

288
00:31:33,504 --> 00:31:34,421
What?

289
00:31:34,505 --> 00:31:37,049
To be swallowed whole by a snake, or...

290
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,427
eaten alive by a great white shark?

291
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,098
You're a freak, Valentine.
I plan on dying peacefully...

292
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,769
in bed snuggled in Wesker's big,
burly arms.

293
00:31:49,311 --> 00:31:50,980
–Yeah.
–Me, too, brother.

294
00:31:52,815 --> 00:31:54,066
What's Vickers doing here?

295
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,861
Thought we lost the chopper
with the rest of the budget cuts.

296
00:31:56,944 --> 00:31:58,362
Maybe he just missed us.

297
00:31:58,988 --> 00:32:00,531
Fuck you.

298
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:01,657
Is that right?

299
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,741
Guess not.

300
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,245
–Hey!
–Okay, Chief, what's this all about?

301
00:32:06,328 --> 00:32:07,663
Yeah, what's with the alarm?

302
00:32:07,746 --> 00:32:10,916
Well, if you all shut the hell up
for a second and listen...

303
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,460
maybe you'll find out.

304
00:32:15,171 --> 00:32:17,173
Honestly, I don't know.

305
00:32:17,256 --> 00:32:19,550
–You don't know?
–That's right, Redfield. I do not know.

306
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:23,637
What I do know is that Marini and Dooley
are currently not answering their radios.

307
00:32:23,721 --> 00:32:27,641
They're investigating a report of a body
up by the Spencer Mansion.

308
00:32:27,725 --> 00:32:29,018
You think it's connected?

309
00:32:30,186 --> 00:32:32,605
What's a Spencer Mansion?

310
00:32:32,688 --> 00:32:34,940
Well, as I think most of you know,

311
00:32:35,024 --> 00:32:38,194
Oswald Spencer was the creator
of the Umbrella Corporation

312
00:32:38,277 --> 00:32:41,780
and the mansion was his home
until the year of his death in...

313
00:32:41,864 --> 00:32:44,158
What the fuck are you doing here, Leon?

314
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:46,243
You said everyone into the briefing room,
so, here I am.

315
00:32:46,327 --> 00:32:48,871
I didn't mean you, you moron!

316
00:32:48,954 --> 00:32:51,165
Not you, Leon! Everyone else!

317
00:32:51,248 --> 00:32:54,001
What if someone wanders in
and there's no one behind the front desk?

318
00:32:54,084 --> 00:32:55,669
An old lady's looking
for a cat or something.

319
00:32:55,753 --> 00:32:56,587
Okay. Yeah, you're right.

320
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,963
–Jesus Christ. Get back there, man.
–You're right.

321
00:32:58,047 --> 00:33:00,591
And get a haircut, you goddamn hippie.

322
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,760
It's not Woodstock.

323
00:33:04,887 --> 00:33:06,889
Take it easy on the rook, chief.

324
00:33:11,435 --> 00:33:13,813
I'm sorry, Wesker. Is that important?

325
00:33:13,896 --> 00:33:14,897
No, I'm good.

326
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,065
A new girlfriend?

327
00:33:18,901 --> 00:33:20,778
Maybe you could take her out to eat
at Planet Hollywood.

328
00:33:20,861 --> 00:33:22,112
They have a new one in Gatlin.

329
00:33:23,823 --> 00:33:25,783
They got a great salad.

330
00:33:25,866 --> 00:33:26,867
A little wine.

331
00:33:26,951 --> 00:33:29,119
Or maybe just take her back
to your apartment.

332
00:33:29,203 --> 00:33:32,164
Rent a movie at Blockbuster,
get cozy on the couch.

333
00:33:32,248 --> 00:33:33,541
Put on some Journey.

334
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:38,003
Steve Perry's voice, what it does
to a woman's heart, am I right?

335
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,464
How's that sound?

336
00:33:42,007 --> 00:33:43,884
Sounds like I might be getting laid.

337
00:33:44,927 --> 00:33:49,181
But it ain't gonna happen tonight, because
I want you dressed in five, all of you,

338
00:33:49,265 --> 00:33:52,393
and ready to fly, because I wanna know
where the hell Bravo team is

339
00:33:52,476 --> 00:33:55,437
and what the fuck all those alarms
are about! You got me?

340
00:33:55,521 --> 00:33:57,982
Come on, get movin'. Go.

341
00:33:58,566 --> 00:33:59,692
Let's go.

342
00:33:59,775 --> 00:34:01,360
Get a move on it!

343
00:34:01,443 --> 00:34:02,319
Yeah.

344
00:34:02,403 --> 00:34:04,613
Hey, I'll meet you guys in the chopper.

345
00:34:11,954 --> 00:34:13,664
What the fuck is this?

346
00:34:35,978 --> 00:34:37,980
Wesker, let's get going.

347
00:34:52,911 --> 00:34:55,581
Slow down, William. You're gonna crash.

348
00:34:56,665 --> 00:34:57,917
William, slow down!

349
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:00,377
Where are we going?

350
00:35:03,339 --> 00:35:05,007
Why can't you tell me
why we're in such a hurry to leave?

351
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:09,844
Leaving, that's what they want.
So they can destroy my life's work.

352
00:35:09,929 --> 00:35:11,263
Daddy, watch out!

353
00:35:16,602 --> 00:35:17,978
You almost hit that girl.

354
00:35:22,358 --> 00:35:23,609
You okay?

355
00:35:35,162 --> 00:35:37,581
Wake up. Wake up.

356
00:35:38,707 --> 00:35:41,627
We need you to get up and come with us.

357
00:35:49,468 --> 00:35:50,803
Where are we going?

358
00:35:51,345 --> 00:35:52,888
It's okay, little girl.

359
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:56,767
Because we have found you a new family.

360
00:35:57,476 --> 00:35:59,061
They're waiting for you just outside.

361
00:35:59,145 --> 00:36:01,230
It's all so very exciting.

362
00:36:03,941 --> 00:36:05,067
Don't worry about your brother.

363
00:36:05,151 --> 00:36:07,736
He'll be coming along as well,
in due course.

364
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,947
We would never separate the two of you.

365
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,532
We just need you to come with us

366
00:36:11,615 --> 00:36:14,076
and someone will collect
all of your belongings.

367
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,586
William!

368
00:38:56,113 --> 00:38:57,114
What the fuck?

369
00:38:58,824 --> 00:39:01,243
You might wanna get a fire extinguisher.

370
00:39:01,327 --> 00:39:03,871
And lock the gates, there may be others.

371
00:39:06,457 --> 00:39:07,500
Other what?

372
00:39:43,786 --> 00:39:44,954
Fuck this.

373
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:57,967
Hi, sir, what's goin' on? Because...

374
00:39:58,676 --> 00:40:00,386
Should we call someone?

375
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,638
Who you gonna call? You're the police.

376
00:40:03,514 --> 00:40:04,807
An ambulance?

377
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,183
Look, I'm no medical expert,

378
00:40:06,267 --> 00:40:08,894
but I think that guy
might just be beyond saving.

379
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:14,525
Besides, I think you'll find that
all the phone lines in the city are dead.

380
00:40:14,608 --> 00:40:15,860
Take care of yourself, Leon.

381
00:40:23,492 --> 00:40:25,286
Fuck. Fuck.

382
00:40:25,911 --> 00:40:27,872
Sir? Hey, hey! Sir!

383
00:40:29,123 --> 00:40:30,916
Where are you going, sir?

384
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,670
Shit.

385
00:40:34,753 --> 00:40:36,005
Hey, hey...

386
00:40:37,715 --> 00:40:40,509
Hey, sir, I know I'm new here

387
00:40:40,593 --> 00:40:43,012
and I don't really know
what's going on, but...

388
00:40:43,095 --> 00:40:45,723
So, where are you going?
Who's in charge now?

389
00:40:45,806 --> 00:40:46,807
You are.

390
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:50,060
No, no, no. I'm a rookie, right?

391
00:40:50,144 --> 00:40:52,563
Yeah, well, congratulations, rookie,
on the promotion.

392
00:40:52,646 --> 00:40:54,690
I'm sure your father
would be incredibly proud

393
00:40:54,773 --> 00:40:58,944
that his pathetic specimen of a son
is rising so quickly through the ranks.

394
00:40:59,028 --> 00:41:02,531
Sir, I really don't think you should go.
I don't think I'm prepared to handle...

395
00:41:02,615 --> 00:41:07,119
I'm goin'. At ease, take care, good luck.
I know you'll do a great job.

396
00:41:11,248 --> 00:41:12,249
Sir.

397
00:41:14,001 --> 00:41:15,002
Sir!

398
00:41:22,259 --> 00:41:23,385
Fuck.

399
00:42:12,643 --> 00:42:13,811
Right here.

400
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:52,349
Radio Irons.
Tell him we found Bravo team's jeep.

401
00:42:53,517 --> 00:42:54,435
Will do.

402
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:16,457
Holy shit.

403
00:43:22,713 --> 00:43:25,216
Jesus Christ. What the hell happened here?

404
00:43:26,425 --> 00:43:27,885
Where are they?

405
00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:36,977
What the fuck?

406
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,857
What the fuck is wrong with it?

407
00:43:48,113 --> 00:43:49,073
Really?

408
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:51,325
What?

409
00:43:51,408 --> 00:43:53,327
Someone should confiscate that.

410
00:43:54,995 --> 00:43:55,913
Just...

411
00:43:55,996 --> 00:43:56,997
Hey, guys.

412
00:44:01,168 --> 00:44:02,586
They went this way.

413
00:45:50,402 --> 00:45:52,822
Marini and Dooley are in here somewhere.

414
00:45:52,905 --> 00:45:54,657
We should split up.

415
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:55,741
What?

416
00:45:56,617 --> 00:46:00,371
The faster we find them,
the faster we can get the fuck outta here.

417
00:46:01,664 --> 00:46:03,040
All right, we go in pairs.

418
00:46:03,707 --> 00:46:05,501
I'll go with you, Wesker.

419
00:46:08,129 --> 00:46:10,422
Keep your shit wired at all times.

420
00:46:25,312 --> 00:46:28,858
<i>Oh, all night, all night</i>

421
00:46:28,941 --> 00:46:31,068
<i>Oh, every night</i>

422
00:46:32,361 --> 00:46:33,988
<i>So hold tight...</i>

423
00:46:36,365 --> 00:46:37,825
This is not good.

424
00:46:38,659 --> 00:46:40,911
<i>This is the Umbrella Corporation.</i>

425
00:46:40,995 --> 00:46:44,373
<i>Return to your vehicles
and return to your homes and businesses.</i>

426
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:46,792
Hey!

427
00:46:48,461 --> 00:46:50,379
Come on! Go back!

428
00:46:51,964 --> 00:46:54,633
Go back! Move your truck back.
We're blocked in!

429
00:46:55,509 --> 00:46:57,720
How much longer is this gonna be?

430
00:46:57,803 --> 00:46:59,847
Guys, I gotta get to work.

431
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:01,140
Don't move.

432
00:47:04,977 --> 00:47:06,729
Oh, damn, damn it!

433
00:47:07,897 --> 00:47:09,815
Oh, damn, damn, damn.

434
00:47:09,899 --> 00:47:11,484
Open up! Come on, please!

435
00:47:11,567 --> 00:47:14,612
Get off! Get the fuck away from my car!

436
00:47:14,695 --> 00:47:16,906
Get off, Jack! Get off!

437
00:47:19,533 --> 00:47:22,578
Fuck. Oh, goddamn!

438
00:47:22,661 --> 00:47:24,246
Oh, man!

439
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:26,373
That was close!

440
00:47:27,082 --> 00:47:28,626
Oh, shit!

441
00:47:46,685 --> 00:47:49,104
<i>Raccoon City, locked down and secured.</i>

442
00:47:55,194 --> 00:47:56,862
Please let me in.

443
00:47:59,323 --> 00:48:00,741
Let me in.

444
00:48:02,743 --> 00:48:04,453
Let me in.

445
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:07,623
Help, please.

446
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:33,542
Come on, come on.

447
00:49:37,087 --> 00:49:40,549
Goddamn bullets. Come on.

448
00:49:45,596 --> 00:49:46,639
Fuck!

449
00:51:07,887 --> 00:51:09,638
Drop your gun! Show me your hands!

450
00:51:17,021 --> 00:51:18,272
Haven't got a gun.

451
00:51:21,567 --> 00:51:23,152
Who the fuck are you?

452
00:51:26,697 --> 00:51:27,740
Come on.

453
00:51:30,367 --> 00:51:31,994
Leon, put that gun down.

454
00:51:32,912 --> 00:51:34,788
Sir, are you in charge again?

455
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:47,718
Please let me in. Let me in!

456
00:51:56,185 --> 00:51:58,354
Where's my brother, Chris Redfield?

457
00:51:58,437 --> 00:52:01,565
So, you're Chris's little sister, huh?
I didn't think the two of you spoke.

458
00:52:05,444 --> 00:52:07,613
He's up in the Arklay Mountains
with the rest of Alpha team.

459
00:52:07,696 --> 00:52:11,408
Hey, sorry, does someone wanna tell me
what the fuck is going on here?

460
00:52:12,952 --> 00:52:14,245
What's happening to them?

461
00:52:15,412 --> 00:52:16,872
Let me in.

462
00:52:23,295 --> 00:52:25,089
Clearly, some bad shit.

463
00:52:25,798 --> 00:52:28,717
All the exits out of Raccoon
have been blocked by Umbrella.

464
00:52:28,801 --> 00:52:30,636
We need more ammo and guns.

465
00:52:32,429 --> 00:52:33,806
The armory's downstairs.

466
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:35,266
Where are you going?

467
00:52:35,349 --> 00:52:37,309
I'm gonna try and get a hold
of your brother.

468
00:52:37,393 --> 00:52:39,019
There's no way out of Raccoon by road,

469
00:52:39,103 --> 00:52:41,313
but we might just be able
to take a helicopter.

470
00:53:26,859 --> 00:53:28,194
What is that?

471
00:53:29,904 --> 00:53:31,947
I'll explain in a minute.

472
00:54:08,025 --> 00:54:09,693
Hey. R.P.D.

473
00:54:11,946 --> 00:54:13,197
Help me.

474
00:54:14,073 --> 00:54:16,158
Hands. Show me your hands.

475
00:54:28,963 --> 00:54:30,840
What the fuck?

476
00:54:32,758 --> 00:54:34,802
I need you to stay right there.

477
00:54:46,063 --> 00:54:47,273
Oh, fuck.

478
00:54:52,361 --> 00:54:55,573
Marini, fuck. Hey.

479
00:54:55,656 --> 00:54:57,324
Okay, here, here, here.

480
00:54:57,408 --> 00:54:59,368
Put pressure right there, okay?

481
00:54:59,451 --> 00:55:01,954
As much pressure as you can.
Find Dooley.

482
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:06,917
You're gonna be okay, all right?
You'll be fine.

483
00:55:07,001 --> 00:55:08,419
This is nothing.

484
00:55:09,712 --> 00:55:12,631
Shit. Oh, God.

485
00:55:12,715 --> 00:55:14,508
Shit. Shit.

486
00:55:34,195 --> 00:55:35,821
Just hold on, man, all right?

487
00:55:39,033 --> 00:55:42,578
Fuck. Shit. No, no, no.

488
00:56:13,275 --> 00:56:14,235
Dooley.

489
00:56:28,624 --> 00:56:29,875
Richard!

490
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:43,556
Redfield!

491
00:56:50,146 --> 00:56:51,397
Aiken!

492
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,107
Let's get the fuck out of here!

493
00:58:35,042 --> 00:58:37,294
–The fuck you doin', Wesker?
–Hold on.

494
00:58:43,676 --> 00:58:45,427
Listen, do you hear that?

495
00:58:59,608 --> 00:59:01,861
What the hell is Vickers doing?

496
00:59:04,113 --> 00:59:05,656
Run!

497
00:59:32,641 --> 00:59:33,934
Okay.

498
00:59:34,018 --> 00:59:37,062
Yeah, I've actually never been
in this room, so...

499
00:59:44,987 --> 00:59:46,155
That's good, right?

500
00:59:46,238 --> 00:59:49,909
I think it's just... sort of jammed.

501
00:59:49,992 --> 00:59:50,993
Here.

502
00:59:54,371 --> 00:59:55,456
Put this on.

503
00:59:57,208 --> 00:59:59,627
So, how do you know so much about guns?

504
01:00:02,505 --> 01:00:04,757
My parents died in a car accident
when I was eight.

505
01:00:05,382 --> 01:00:07,927
My brother and I grew up
in the orphanage here.

506
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:09,678
I ran away a long time ago.

507
01:00:10,888 --> 01:00:12,765
I had to learn to handle myself quickly.

508
01:00:13,432 --> 01:00:14,809
Right, yeah.

509
01:00:16,936 --> 01:00:18,521
You're probably wondering
what a guy like me

510
01:00:18,604 --> 01:00:20,272
is doing as a cop, right?

511
01:00:21,232 --> 01:00:22,399
Kind of.

512
01:00:23,484 --> 01:00:24,652
Yeah, me too.

513
01:00:26,695 --> 01:00:29,990
Hey! Someone get me out of here!

514
01:00:31,408 --> 01:00:32,243
Hello?

515
01:00:32,326 --> 01:00:35,246
You're a police station.
I'll see what else I can find.

516
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:37,957
Yeah.

517
01:00:38,457 --> 01:00:42,086
I'm in the fucking basement.
They put me in the fucking basement.

518
01:00:42,169 --> 01:00:43,295
Get me outta here.

519
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:46,173
I know you're up there.
Oh, thank God.

520
01:00:47,842 --> 01:00:51,637
Thank fucking God.
You gotta get me outta here, man.

521
01:00:52,221 --> 01:00:53,597
Who the fuck are you?

522
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,101
Well, how about I tell you
once you get me the fuck outta here?

523
01:01:06,777 --> 01:01:07,862
Jesus.

524
01:01:12,658 --> 01:01:13,909
Is he okay?

525
01:01:17,121 --> 01:01:18,122
Him?

526
01:01:18,998 --> 01:01:21,250
Oh, yeah, no, he's fuckin' fine. Yeah.

527
01:01:21,333 --> 01:01:25,254
Yeah, who doesn't cough up a little blood
on the floor when they're feeling sick?

528
01:01:25,337 --> 01:01:27,006
Just a little cold.

529
01:01:27,089 --> 01:01:28,799
Of course he's not fuckin' okay, man.
Look at him.

530
01:01:28,883 --> 01:01:30,217
Open the goddamn door.

531
01:01:31,719 --> 01:01:33,262
Why are you locked up?

532
01:01:33,971 --> 01:01:37,475
Why? Because I found out the truth.

533
01:01:39,143 --> 01:01:40,978
The truth? What truth?

534
01:01:41,061 --> 01:01:43,981
Listen to me,
you fuckin' boy band wannabe.

535
01:01:44,064 --> 01:01:49,153
You think Umbrella spend all their time
makin' aspirins and vitamin tablets?

536
01:01:50,446 --> 01:01:51,780
No fuckin' way.

537
01:01:51,864 --> 01:01:53,616
Jesus Christ. Hey!

538
01:01:53,699 --> 01:01:55,993
–That's... my gun.
–Open the goddamn door.

539
01:01:56,076 --> 01:01:57,161
–Do it.
–You don't have to do this.

540
01:01:57,244 --> 01:01:58,704
Sure I don't.

541
01:01:59,371 --> 01:02:03,125
You and all your police buddies,
you're not sick like the rest of the town

542
01:02:03,209 --> 01:02:05,252
just 'cause you got
a good immune system, right?

543
01:02:05,336 --> 01:02:08,547
Fuck, you probably had a little injection,

544
01:02:08,631 --> 01:02:11,133
a little vitamin pill
you didn't even realize.

545
01:02:11,842 --> 01:02:13,928
Keeps you safe, at least for a while.

546
01:02:14,553 --> 01:02:17,723
But the others, ordinary people...

547
01:02:18,766 --> 01:02:20,100
expendable ones...

548
01:02:20,976 --> 01:02:22,978
Yeah, good fuckin' luck, right?

549
01:02:23,062 --> 01:02:24,313
Open the goddamn door.

550
01:02:25,147 --> 01:02:27,191
The keys are over there on the desk.
Do it, go!

551
01:02:27,274 --> 01:02:30,194
Okay, okay, okay. Here I go. Okay.

552
01:02:30,277 --> 01:02:33,072
Jesus fuckin' Christ.

553
01:02:35,449 --> 01:02:38,202
Come on, man.
Jesus fuckin' Christ. Hurry up.

554
01:02:40,246 --> 01:02:41,664
Oh, fuck me.

555
01:02:42,289 --> 01:02:45,709
Have you ever heard of the T–Virus?
And the G–virus?

556
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:47,920
Of course you fuckin' haven't.

557
01:02:48,003 --> 01:02:50,506
Well, it's a virus
that genetically modifies

558
01:02:50,589 --> 01:02:52,216
the DNA of a living cell,

559
01:02:52,299 --> 01:02:54,927
and it's turning these people
into fuckin' weapons, man.

560
01:02:56,095 --> 01:02:57,847
So you need to get me
the fuck outta here, okay?

561
01:03:00,099 --> 01:03:01,350
Be an asshole about it.

562
01:03:01,433 --> 01:03:03,227
Yeah, well, I'm done taking chances.

563
01:03:07,106 --> 01:03:08,440
Fuck.

564
01:03:08,524 --> 01:03:10,860
Come on, man. Jesus fuckin' Christ.

565
01:03:10,943 --> 01:03:13,112
All right. You know what?
Just one second, please.

566
01:03:15,281 --> 01:03:17,449
You're no Einstein, are you, buddy?

567
01:03:18,701 --> 01:03:21,370
Thank fucking God. Oh, Jesus.

568
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,081
Fuck!

569
01:03:25,624 --> 01:03:26,667
Shit!

570
01:03:28,961 --> 01:03:31,130
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.

571
01:03:31,213 --> 01:03:32,631
Wait, just slow down.

572
01:03:40,764 --> 01:03:42,516
Wait, wait, wait.

573
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:43,684
Wait!

574
01:03:53,152 --> 01:03:54,111
Hey.

575
01:04:11,337 --> 01:04:12,296
Ben.

576
01:04:25,184 --> 01:04:28,479
Get your shit together or you're not
gonna make it through the night.

577
01:04:35,236 --> 01:04:36,403
Oh, fuck.

578
01:04:50,918 --> 01:04:52,002
Are you done?

579
01:04:55,339 --> 01:04:57,133
I just really wanna get out of this town

580
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:01,011
Vickers, can you read me? Over.

581
01:05:02,888 --> 01:05:06,100
Vickers, this is Chief Irons,
pick up your damn radio!

582
01:05:08,769 --> 01:05:11,147
<i>Vickers, can you read me? Over.</i>

583
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:14,024
<i>Vickers, this is Irons.
Pick up your damn radio.</i>

584
01:05:19,238 --> 01:05:20,281
Hey.

585
01:05:28,914 --> 01:05:30,374
Holy shit.

586
01:05:39,758 --> 01:05:41,177
You saved my life.

587
01:05:49,351 --> 01:05:50,853
Oh, shit.

588
01:05:55,774 --> 01:05:58,694
Come on. Come on, come on.

589
01:06:12,458 --> 01:06:14,877
Holy shit, she was telling the truth.

590
01:06:17,046 --> 01:06:18,380
Truth about what?

591
01:06:22,802 --> 01:06:24,428
Wesker, what's going on?

592
01:06:27,932 --> 01:06:30,392
They contacted me several months ago.

593
01:06:32,353 --> 01:06:35,689
It was once Umbrella started moving
their operations out of Raccoon.

594
01:06:36,565 --> 01:06:37,858
I don't know who they are.

595
01:06:38,567 --> 01:06:40,569
I don't know and I don't care.

596
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:45,908
They're just some people
with a vested interest in...

597
01:06:45,991 --> 01:06:49,203
getting hold of whatever dirty secrets
Umbrella are keeping down there

598
01:06:49,286 --> 01:06:50,454
and exposing them.

599
01:06:51,247 --> 01:06:53,040
What are you talking about?

600
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:58,170
Come on, Jill, don't look at me like that.
It's just money, all right.

601
01:06:58,254 --> 01:07:00,172
And they have plenty of it.

602
01:07:00,256 --> 01:07:02,341
It was just a way of getting out of...

603
01:07:03,425 --> 01:07:06,804
this small–town dead–end life.

604
01:07:08,806 --> 01:07:09,932
So...

605
01:07:12,268 --> 01:07:14,228
...you were just gonna leave us.

606
01:07:18,524 --> 01:07:19,817
Come on.

607
01:07:20,734 --> 01:07:25,656
We have to find Chris and Richard,
and tell them that Vickers is dead.

608
01:07:29,285 --> 01:07:30,744
Come on.

609
01:07:32,913 --> 01:07:35,416
Come on, these are your friends!

610
01:07:42,006 --> 01:07:43,757
I can't.

611
01:07:43,841 --> 01:07:45,593
What are you...

612
01:08:05,404 --> 01:08:06,655
Oh, my God.

613
01:08:12,536 --> 01:08:14,788
What the fuck happened to him?

614
01:08:16,874 --> 01:08:18,000
I don't know.

615
01:08:30,763 --> 01:08:34,015
Wesker. Wesker!

616
01:08:52,033 --> 01:08:53,452
Did you get a hold of my brother?

617
01:08:54,411 --> 01:08:55,371
No.

618
01:09:00,209 --> 01:09:02,377
We need that helicopter to get outta here.

619
01:09:02,461 --> 01:09:04,380
We need to get to the Arklay Mountains.

620
01:09:04,462 --> 01:09:05,506
How?

621
01:09:07,424 --> 01:09:09,218
I think I know a way. Come on.

622
01:09:15,724 --> 01:09:17,143
Oh, shit.

623
01:09:19,645 --> 01:09:20,645
Come on!

624
01:09:26,109 --> 01:09:27,778
The loading dock's this way.

625
01:09:32,408 --> 01:09:33,367
Shit.

626
01:10:01,187 --> 01:10:02,313
Let's go. Let's go.

627
01:10:02,813 --> 01:10:03,856
Go, go!

628
01:10:04,356 --> 01:10:05,733
Come on, come on, come on.

629
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:44,146
What are we doing here?

630
01:11:35,656 --> 01:11:38,868
<i>We need you to get up and come with us.</i>

631
01:11:39,869 --> 01:11:41,245
Where are we going?

632
01:11:54,341 --> 01:11:57,595
Hey. Why are we here?

633
01:11:57,678 --> 01:12:01,390
This place has a secret passageway
that leads to the Spencer mansion.

634
01:12:01,474 --> 01:12:03,476
How'd you know about this place?

635
01:12:04,602 --> 01:12:06,604
They bought you off, didn't they?

636
01:12:06,687 --> 01:12:09,982
They paid you to keep quiet about
all the shit they were doing in here.

637
01:12:10,065 --> 01:12:12,735
And now, they've left you to rot here
just like us.

638
01:12:25,789 --> 01:12:26,790
Fuck!

639
01:12:38,803 --> 01:12:40,137
Guys?

640
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:48,896
Look.

641
01:12:51,649 --> 01:12:52,817
Guys!

642
01:12:59,657 --> 01:13:00,866
What the fuck?

643
01:13:01,742 --> 01:13:04,829
No, there was someone there.

644
01:13:37,361 --> 01:13:39,238
–Run!
–Come on!

645
01:13:41,949 --> 01:13:42,908
Go!

646
01:13:45,661 --> 01:13:46,662
Shit.

647
01:14:40,216 --> 01:14:41,425
Lisa Trevor.

648
01:14:45,429 --> 01:14:47,681
We need to get to the Spencer Mansion.

649
01:14:48,641 --> 01:14:50,601
You know how, don't you?

650
01:14:58,192 --> 01:14:59,735
Friend?

651
01:15:08,869 --> 01:15:09,870
Come on.

652
01:15:16,168 --> 01:15:18,420
<i>Why are we going in here?</i>

653
01:15:21,674 --> 01:15:23,092
I want my brother.

654
01:15:25,344 --> 01:15:26,762
<i>She bit my hand.</i>

655
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:29,265
Get her.

656
01:15:44,071 --> 01:15:45,239
Key.

657
01:15:51,453 --> 01:15:54,206
The second key.

658
01:15:58,836 --> 01:16:00,045
Go to...

659
01:16:04,258 --> 01:16:07,845
Key. Key. Key.

660
01:16:41,462 --> 01:16:42,421
Thank you.

661
01:16:43,422 --> 01:16:45,257
Claire.

662
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:52,598
You got some weird friends.

663
01:18:38,287 --> 01:18:39,246
Fuck.

664
01:19:05,773 --> 01:19:06,732
Dooley?

665
01:19:11,195 --> 01:19:12,196
Fuck.

666
01:19:59,618 --> 01:20:02,371
We have to get to the helicopter.
Where's Wesker?

667
01:20:03,747 --> 01:20:06,250
The helicopter crashed. Vickers is dead.

668
01:20:08,794 --> 01:20:12,047
–Wesker betrayed us, Chris.
–What?

669
01:20:12,131 --> 01:20:14,216
He was gonna leave us here to die.

670
01:20:15,509 --> 01:20:18,304
We have to follow him,
I think it's our only way outta here.

671
01:22:06,871 --> 01:22:08,038
What is this place?

672
01:22:11,041 --> 01:22:12,668
What were Umbrella doing here?

673
01:22:15,004 --> 01:22:17,548
This is where they were bringing the kids
from the orphanage.

674
01:22:30,603 --> 01:22:32,521
They were experimenting on 'em.

675
01:22:37,276 --> 01:22:38,944
This is where they tried to bring me.

676
01:22:58,005 --> 01:22:59,840
Claire. It's okay.

677
01:22:59,924 --> 01:23:00,925
No!

678
01:23:05,304 --> 01:23:06,430
It's okay.

679
01:23:25,950 --> 01:23:27,535
Let's go find my brother.

680
01:23:39,797 --> 01:23:40,923
It's okay.

681
01:23:53,936 --> 01:23:55,980
William, what have you been doing
down here?

682
01:23:57,773 --> 01:23:58,732
God's work.

683
01:24:14,248 --> 01:24:15,332
William.

684
01:24:16,876 --> 01:24:19,753
Hey. How did you get down...?

685
01:24:23,924 --> 01:24:25,885
No, no, no.

686
01:24:30,473 --> 01:24:33,142
Listen, I've just come for that.

687
01:24:35,394 --> 01:24:37,730
This is my life's work.
I'm not giving it to anybody.

688
01:24:38,856 --> 01:24:41,066
I'm not really offering
you a choice here, pal.

689
01:24:41,775 --> 01:24:43,777
Okay, wait. Just put the gun down.

690
01:24:44,862 --> 01:24:46,071
Just put it down.

691
01:24:49,533 --> 01:24:50,951
Who do you work for?

692
01:24:52,828 --> 01:24:54,163
Doesn't matter.

693
01:24:59,168 --> 01:25:01,295
No, I don't suppose it does.

694
01:25:13,808 --> 01:25:14,934
Daddy!

695
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:19,814
–No, no, no!
–Daddy!

696
01:25:22,733 --> 01:25:25,027
God. Oh, God. Okay.

697
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:26,403
Vials.

698
01:25:27,446 --> 01:25:29,490
Vials. Vials.

699
01:25:31,367 --> 01:25:34,662
Hey! I need that.

700
01:25:41,877 --> 01:25:43,170
Just hand me the vials.

701
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,799
Okay, don't do anything stupid,
lady, okay?

702
01:25:52,513 --> 01:25:53,514
Fuck.

703
01:25:55,015 --> 01:25:56,517
Where'd the kid go?

704
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:57,810
Kid?

705
01:25:58,519 --> 01:25:59,603
Kid?

706
01:26:00,229 --> 01:26:01,689
What the fuck?

707
01:26:03,774 --> 01:26:04,650
You.

708
01:26:10,197 --> 01:26:12,199
You didn't have to make it like this.

709
01:26:13,492 --> 01:26:15,286
What the hell is wrong with you?

710
01:26:21,167 --> 01:26:23,085
This is so fucked.

711
01:26:55,159 --> 01:26:57,369
Hey. It's okay.

712
01:26:57,453 --> 01:26:58,787
He killed them.

713
01:26:58,871 --> 01:27:00,331
Hey.

714
01:27:00,414 --> 01:27:02,374
Hey, hey, hey.

715
01:27:02,458 --> 01:27:04,710
Jesus, Valentine,
you and that fucking gun.

716
01:27:07,046 --> 01:27:08,297
Hey, no, no, no.
We're gonna get you out of here.

717
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:10,549
No, no, no. Jill, I fucked up.

718
01:27:12,426 --> 01:27:14,762
Umbrella are gonna destroy this place.

719
01:27:15,429 --> 01:27:17,348
All of Raccoon, okay?

720
01:27:17,431 --> 01:27:19,934
There's a train tunnel
beneath this facility.

721
01:27:20,684 --> 01:27:23,354
It leads to the other side
of the mountains and into Gatlin.

722
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:26,440
You need to get to that train.

723
01:27:27,525 --> 01:27:29,235
You need to go now.

724
01:27:34,365 --> 01:27:37,159
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

725
01:27:40,162 --> 01:27:42,122
I wouldn't have pulled the trigger, kid.

726
01:27:45,167 --> 01:27:46,418
No, no, no.

727
01:27:47,378 --> 01:27:48,462
Wesker!

728
01:28:51,734 --> 01:28:53,360
Come on, just through here.

729
01:28:56,197 --> 01:28:57,198
Okay.

730
01:29:00,034 --> 01:29:01,076
Oh, shit.

731
01:29:19,595 --> 01:29:20,513
Jesus.

732
01:29:22,431 --> 01:29:23,390
Hide.

733
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:27,812
Come on. Go. Go.

734
01:29:59,135 --> 01:30:02,221
Chris, come out and play.

735
01:30:08,352 --> 01:30:12,356
Did you really believe
you could be part of my family?

736
01:30:13,566 --> 01:30:16,485
Such a sweet little soldier.

737
01:30:17,278 --> 01:30:19,613
Such a loyal little drone.

738
01:30:27,997 --> 01:30:29,331
Where are you, Chris?

739
01:30:36,255 --> 01:30:41,093
How could you be so dumb
when your sister's so smart?

740
01:31:10,039 --> 01:31:11,081
You know...

741
01:31:13,542 --> 01:31:17,004
I almost feel sad having to kill you.

742
01:31:22,092 --> 01:31:23,260
Almost.

743
01:31:24,929 --> 01:31:28,224
You know, I should have taken you
and your sister down to the lab.

744
01:31:28,307 --> 01:31:31,936
You would have made excellent specimens.

745
01:31:34,438 --> 01:31:35,356
Get...

746
01:31:36,774 --> 01:31:37,608
...the fuck...

747
01:31:38,484 --> 01:31:39,652
...away...

748
01:31:43,239 --> 01:31:44,406
...from my brother.

749
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:49,036
Do it.

750
01:31:59,338 --> 01:32:03,217
Chris... my boy.

751
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:05,052
Shut the fuck up.

752
01:32:22,111 --> 01:32:23,821
I'm so glad you're okay.

753
01:32:25,489 --> 01:32:27,867
This is really nice,
but I think I broke some ribs.

754
01:32:27,950 --> 01:32:29,785
Oh, my God. Sorry. Are you hurt?

755
01:32:29,869 --> 01:32:31,787
No, no, no. I'm fine, I'm fine.

756
01:32:31,871 --> 01:32:34,665
We gotta get the fuck outta here.
Umbrella is gonna level this place.

757
01:32:34,748 --> 01:32:35,624
Okay.

758
01:32:36,208 --> 01:32:37,042
Hey.

759
01:32:37,710 --> 01:32:39,295
–Rookie?
–Yeah.

760
01:32:39,378 --> 01:32:41,297
Trust me,
I'm as surprised as you are, buddy.

761
01:32:42,173 --> 01:32:43,048
Shall we go?

762
01:32:43,674 --> 01:32:44,592
Let's go.

763
01:32:50,055 --> 01:32:51,015
Come on!

764
01:33:07,781 --> 01:33:08,741
Sit down.

765
01:33:09,450 --> 01:33:10,910
–We'll get it started.
–Okay.

766
01:33:12,495 --> 01:33:14,914
We only have five minutes left
until the place self–destructs.

767
01:33:17,958 --> 01:33:19,210
How does it all work?

768
01:33:33,641 --> 01:33:34,767
All right.

769
01:33:51,742 --> 01:33:53,494
We're gonna get out of here.

770
01:34:11,762 --> 01:34:13,931
I should have listened to you
a long time ago.

771
01:34:15,558 --> 01:34:16,642
I'm sorry.

772
01:34:19,687 --> 01:34:20,729
It's okay.

773
01:34:24,066 --> 01:34:26,485
I may have scratched the paint
on your bike.

774
01:34:29,738 --> 01:34:31,574
–Don't make me laugh.
–Sorry.

775
01:34:35,077 --> 01:34:35,953
Oh, f––

776
01:35:28,714 --> 01:35:30,758
Go get the others. I'll find a way out.

777
01:35:30,841 --> 01:35:32,718
–You okay?
–Uh–huh.

778
01:35:49,151 --> 01:35:52,071
Oh, my God. Sherry, get behind me.

779
01:35:56,283 --> 01:35:57,660
Sherry, run!

780
01:35:59,703 --> 01:36:00,663
Claire!

781
01:36:16,971 --> 01:36:17,847
No!

782
01:36:36,782 --> 01:36:37,741
Hey!

783
01:36:39,034 --> 01:36:40,744
You ugly fuck!

784
01:36:44,165 --> 01:36:45,249
Oh, shit.

785
01:37:08,397 --> 01:37:10,149
A rocket launcher?

786
01:37:11,317 --> 01:37:12,735
Found it in first class.

787
01:37:18,032 --> 01:37:19,533
Holy shit.

788
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:22,536
What the fuck you guys do to this train?

789
01:37:30,169 --> 01:37:31,337
Shit.

790
01:40:09,245 --> 01:40:10,913
You're awake at last.

791
01:40:12,456 --> 01:40:15,042
–Where am I?
–That doesn't matter.

792
01:40:16,168 --> 01:40:20,297
Wait, I don't understand.
I thought I was dead.

793
01:40:20,881 --> 01:40:21,757
You were.

794
01:40:22,258 --> 01:40:23,175
My eyes.

795
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:26,345
What happened to my eyes? I can't see.

796
01:40:27,138 --> 01:40:28,931
It's a side effect.

797
01:40:29,014 --> 01:40:32,393
One of the things we had to do
to bring you back.

798
01:40:32,476 --> 01:40:33,769
There will be others.

799
01:40:50,161 --> 01:40:51,871
You never told me your name.

800
01:40:54,290 --> 01:40:55,374
Ada.

801
01:40:56,542 --> 01:40:57,751
My name is Ada Wong.

802
01:41:00,212 --> 01:41:01,714
What do you want from me?

803
