2
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:19,500
Sorry, baby.

3
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,833
I wasn't thinking.

4
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,125
You've never heard me
shout before.

5
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:38,833
You scared me.

6
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,791
Even when we fight,
we're together, all right?

7
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:52,875
Let's make it a rule.

8
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,125
We're together in this.

9
00:01:58,458 --> 00:01:59,458
All of it.

10
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:18,750
In case I forget?

11
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,041
Your finest work.

12
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,583
This is why we need to get on a beach.
We need to be at the beach right now.

13
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,291
Oh, oh!

14
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,583
Lady in blue.

15
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,458
Tell me how she got here.

16
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,791
- We're really going to do this?
- Yeah.

17
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,958
- The one with the cap?
- Um…

18
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,125
She's an adult spelling bee champion.

19
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,541
- Spelling?
- Yeah!

20
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,208
Yeah, she won this trip
at the Cedar Rapids Adult Spell-Off.

21
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,625
And what was her last word?

22
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,166
Festoon.

23
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:22,625
Festoon!

24
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,291
Come on.
It's one of America's easier bees.

25
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,541
Festoon.

26
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,958
Okay, uh…

27
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:34,291
Your turn now. Mm-hmm…

28
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,708
The couple over there.

29
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,291
See?

30
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,916
Right there? She's hanging on, uh…

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,083
- George.
- George!

32
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,750
- He's George. The guy. Not her.
- Yeah?

33
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,041
He wanted to go to a travel agent.

34
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,291
Okay. Yeah, wh… what was…
what was the agency called?

35
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,833
- Mmm…
- Ideal Travel?

36
00:03:56,333 --> 00:04:00,333
Ideal Travel? That's a great job, baby.
That's why you're the best. Ideal Travel!

37
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:04,416
Oh, yeah, and halfway through arranging
a trip for him and his wife,

38
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,375
he started a sex affair with the agent.

39
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,666
And when his wife found out
and moved out,

40
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,708
the agent exchanged
those tickets for this trip.

41
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,750
A sex affair?

42
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:25,375
Have you ever noticed that
all of yours end up kind of sleazy?

43
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:29,291
If you're not gonna play, you can't
criticize how my people got here.

44
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,875
I mean, it's… it's a style.
You're just sleazy.

45
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,833
Like, it's just how sleazy…

46
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,416
Wow!

47
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,916
- You can't… you can't go down there.
- It's fine.

48
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:02,708
Baby!

49
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,333
Oh, there's our square.

50
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:23,916
Yeah.

51
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,708
There's the hotel in Athens.

52
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,250
What are they saying?

53
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,208
You were right.

54
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,541
Crowds on Friday
are expected to be twice as big.

55
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,708
I'm glad we got out of there then.

56
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:47,125
I mean, we could've watched the speeches
from our balcony

57
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,833
with little bottles of tsipouro.

58
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,833
Oh, no, thanks. That stuff tastes
like you clean your floor with it.

59
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:52,916
I'm kidding.

60
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:55,708
Right.

61
00:05:56,375 --> 00:06:01,041
Hey, I'm very glad we came up here.
Thanks for rolling with it.

62
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:05,875
I know that for every plan discarded,
you think an angel loses its wings.

63
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:10,000
Well, you did make all these plans,
so I can't complain.

64
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:11,625
Thank you.

65
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,916
I appreciate you said that.

66
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,333
I'm learning.

67
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,458
We're not supposed to be here.

68
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,708
I mean, like, no one knows
where we are, and it's…

69
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,625
It's really just the two of us.

70
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,750
Figures in a landscape.

71
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,958
And Zeus had his oracle up here.

72
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,833
I didn't know it was gonna be like this.

73
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,291
Oh my God.

74
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:52,916
What?

75
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,583
I'm having a love attack.

76
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,375
Currently.

77
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:05,166
- Save me from this love attack, please.
- Sorry. I talk too much.

78
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:09,958
Oh my God.

79
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,166
I think we should find one.

80
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,291
One what?

81
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,375
Oracle.

82
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,000
Maybe she can

83
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:24,750
listen to the wind in the leaves
and tell us where we're heading.

84
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,125
I don't need an oracle for that.

85
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,625
Oh, you know?
You know where we're heading?

86
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,500
Is there anything you want to say?

87
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,541
Hmm?

88
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:45,958
Now you're shy.

89
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,708
Are you finished?

90
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,375
With the food, I mean.

91
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:10,333
I want to try
a couple of the sweet things too.

92
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,875
- Well, you just...
- Yeah, I...

93
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,250
I'll be back in a minute.

94
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,500
We need to get some gas as well. So…

95
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,708
We're running low.

96
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,458
<i>Venzini.</i>

97
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,750
<i>Venzini.</i>

98
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,333
<i>Venzini.</i>

99
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,750
Oh, I got it! <i>Venzini.</i>

100
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,333
<i>Venzini.</i>

101
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,583
Wait.

102
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,333
What?

103
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,166
Nothing.

104
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:50,666
Now you're shy.

105
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,666
That rosewater thing was fantastic.

106
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,875
You managed to find
every bakery in North Greece.

107
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,041
Did you know Greek coffee is better
for your heart than other coffee?

108
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:13,166
Yeah, I knew that. Everybody knows that.

109
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,958
It has more antioxidants.
Yeah, the waitress explained it to me.

110
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,333
- I think that's what she was saying.
- Yeah.

111
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,520
You call about tonight? We're all set?

112
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,125
- Beckett.
- No...

113
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,458
You didn't call them.

114
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,958
Uh, well, I… I meant to.

115
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:35,166
- I texted you the number.
- No, wait, wait, wa...

116
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,041
- Wait. No. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Me, me, me, me.

117
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,791
Oh, look, look! It's…
It's right here.

118
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,750
- What is that? I can't see that.
- The number!

119
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,500
- I don't see any number.
- There.

120
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,875
I just…

121
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,166
I forgot to do it,
and by the time we were done eating…

122
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,333
…I saw how late it was, so I...

123
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,541
It's not that late.

124
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,500
I didn't want to bother them, April.

125
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,541
The confused American calling
is probably a lot better for them

126
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:06,291
than unconfirmed guests showing up
in the middle of the night.

127
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,083
We paid.

128
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:13,583
Why should we have to confirm?
Isn't that their job?

129
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,875
I mean, it's the low part
of the low season.

130
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,416
- They should be happy...
- Hi.

131
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,583
Do you speak English?

132
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:21,875
Yes.

133
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,250
- That's us.
- Well, then let me talk to her. She...

134
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,500
We're driving to you right now.

135
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,791
We just passed…

136
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,083
Uh… Nor…

137
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,916
- Egnatia. Do you know where that is?
- E… e… eggnog!

138
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,125
Of course.

139
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:39,916
Thank you.

140
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,208
See you as soon as we can.

141
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,500
- Bye.
- <i>Yassas!</i>

142
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,125
It's fine. See?

143
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,291
Yeah.

144
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,916
Her daughter's gonna wait up.

145
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,750
Thank you.

146
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,500
I'm not that bad.

147
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,833
With me? No.

148
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,458
You've got no problem bothering <i>me</i>

149
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:13,208
when you don't like what we're watching
or what I make for dinner.

150
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,916
Here we go.

151
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,958
Hmm. That's your mental trick, okay?

152
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:24,666
You just pretend other people are me.

153
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,750
Just pretend it's me,

154
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,375
and you won't hold back.

155
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,166
Uh-oh, uh-oh, copilot.

156
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,791
You all right over there?

157
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,166
You're okay to drive?

158
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,750
Yeah, I got it. I got it.

159
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,208
Hey! Help!

160
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,083
April?

161
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:00,833
April?

162
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,208
April?

163
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,791
My girlfriend, Ap… April. April?

164
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,333
Please.

165
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:34,708
Bed.

166
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:36,958
Bed.

167
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,291
Come.

168
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,125
My girlfriend, April?

169
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,958
Where's my girlfriend?

170
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,458
Please.

171
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,625
Um, the car…

172
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,125
How you say?

173
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500
<i>Atihima.</i>

174
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:09,916
I'm very sorry.

175
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,125
You took medicine.

176
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,958
Rest now. Talk after.

177
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:47,250
Um, he says, uh,
he's, uh, making, uh, arrangements.

178
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,916
They, uh… they bring
your, uh, wife to Ioannina,

179
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,750
a bigger town near here.

180
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:03,583
Um, you have to, uh, sign this
to say it's okay.

181
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,000
I want to see her.

182
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,125
At the hospital, he said

183
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,166
I had to wait.

184
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,666
He says, uh… uh, you can, uh, see her

185
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,250
when they get her ready for Ioannina.

186
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,500
Why not now?

187
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,375
Um, the, mmm,

188
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,875
coroner has gone home,
and he has the key.

189
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:02,416
Is there anyone you need to call

190
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,583
to tell in America

191
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,125
what happened?

192
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,416
Her parents.

193
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Sorry?

194
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,625
Her parents.

195
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,541
<i>- </i><i>Hello?</i>
- Bob, it's Beckett.

196
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,583
- Sorry I woke you up.
<i>- Oh, hi, Beckett.</i>

197
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,541
There was an accident with the car.

198
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,791
<i>A what? Are you… are you both okay?</i>

199

<i>- Is she right there, or...</i>
- No.

200
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,541
I'm with the police right now.

201
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,500
<i>Beckett, what happened?</i>

202
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,540
<i>Did someone hit you? Or you…</i>

203
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,250
I sli...

204
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,208
We slid off a road.

205
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,916
<i> Beckett, oh my God. Jesus. Are you…</i>

206
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,375
<i>- That's...</i>
- I know.

207
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,791
<i>But you're…</i>
<i>you're… you're not in Athens?</i>

208
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,125
<i>- Where… where… where should we come to?</i>
- I… I don't know.

209
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,041
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

210
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,125
<i> Give them our number</i>
<i>so they can call us.</i>

211
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:15,583
<i>Stay with her.
Is she… she… she unconscious or…</i>

212
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,291
I will.

213
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,125
<i> Um, just tell us</i>
<i>where we should come!</i>

214
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,583
As soon as I know.

215
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,208
- <i> Oh my God.</i>
- I promise.

216
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,726
<i> Stay with her.</i>
<i>She'll pull through this. She's tough.</i>

217
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,750
<i>She's been through all her life.
You know that.</i>

218
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,791
<i>Have you… have you called her mother?</i>

219
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:34,958
No. Not yet.

220
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:38,541
<i> I'll… I'll… I'll do that</i>
<i>as soon as we hang up, all right?</i>

221
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:39,625
Yes.

222
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,833
<i>Tell her we're…</i>
<i>we're on our way. I… I, uh…</i>

223
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,708
<i>I can't think straight. Um…</i>

224
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,250
- I'm sorry.
<i>- </i><i> No, it's all right. I'll, uh…</i>

225
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,958
<i>I'll start arranging with, um… Just, uh…</i>

226
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,625
<i>Find out what...</i>

227
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,416
- Here.
- Thank you.

228
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,208
I'm sorry for your loss, sir.

229
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,583
Thank you.

230
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,000
Is there anyone else you need to call?

231
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,166
Not right now.

232
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,375
Unbelievable.

233
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,333
The accident, I mean.

234
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,583
The house.

235
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:33,125
I saw the damage. I went
with the truck to pull out your car.

236
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,041
Where did we crash?

237
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:41,083
Down by the turnoff. Four kilometers away.

238
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,208
At least there was no one in the house.

239
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,625
Could have been worse.

240
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,125
- There were people in the house.
- No.

241
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,625
Nobody has, uh, lived there for years.

242
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,416
I saw someone.

243
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,125
Two people.

244
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:02,916
A woman and a boy.

245
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,000
Teenager, maybe. Uh…

246
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,250
Probably immigrants.

247
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,958
Can you describe them?

248
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:15,208
Um… a boy, um…

249
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,000
…red hair, maybe, or something.

250
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:20,958
Right.

251
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,291
Well, if there is…
if there was anyone there,

252
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:29,583
we should, uh, try to find them
and make sure that they're not hurt.

253
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:32,500
- Yes, please do.
- Yeah.

254
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,958
The boy was a redhead.
I remember, he was a redhead.

255
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,291
Right.

256
00:22:56,125 --> 00:23:01,291
So, I think you should get some rest,
and if we can be of any assistance,

257
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,583
you let us know, all right?

258
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:36,583
I can't help.

259
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:47,958
My friend!

260
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:52,000
My friend, come out.

261
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:53,083
It's okay.

262
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:55,708
There's been a… a misunderstanding.

263
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:01,000
Come out. It's okay.

264
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:04,291
It's me.

265
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:13,166
It's okay.

266
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:14,892
You're gonna be...

267
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:43,166
There's nowhere to go, Beckett!

268
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:53,916
Stop!

269
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,916
Beckett!

270
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:37,708
I need… I need help.

271
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,750
Phone?

272
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:55,333
Is this your house?

273
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:56,916
Uh-huh.

274
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:21,333
Wait here.

275
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:39,833
Come. Come.

276
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:53,666
Come.

277
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,083
Sit.

278
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:05,083
Show me.

279
00:35:06,791 --> 00:35:07,833
Oh, okay. Okay.

280
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Ah.

281
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,333
Car…

282
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:22,583
I just need a phone.

283
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:25,083
Yes, but I look first, okay?

284
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:29,583
Hey.

285
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:32,625
This is…

286
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:34,458
<i>Oplo.</i>

287
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,041
I don't know what's happening.

288
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:39,500
People, they've been shooting at...

289
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:41,750
They've been shooting at me.

290
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:44,375
A policeman. Bad policeman.

291
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:45,875
A bad policeman?

292
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,166
An officer.

293
00:35:49,791 --> 00:35:51,083
He had a… a beard.

294
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:04,625
That you need.

295
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,250
Help.

296
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,750
Food.

297
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,541
- You want food?
- I really just need a telephone, please.

298
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:18,333
Yes. Yes, okay.

299
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:31,958
Three persons.

300
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:35,500
Maybe my friends call police.

301
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:37,583
<i>Irema.</i>

302
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,375
You are not here. I make them go.

303
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:24,958
Hey.

304
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:37,208
Excuse me, do you speak English?

305
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,666
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.

306
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:46,375
I need your help. I need to get a call
through to the embassy or the consulate…

307
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:47,583
Look, hey.

308
00:38:47,666 --> 00:38:51,000
Don't… don't do this,
because they will sting you. Careful.

309
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:53,416
US Embassy. The US Embassy.

310
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,083
- Please.
- You can have my phone.

311
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,416
- Wait. Yeah.
- Thank you.

312
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,666
Shit. I don't know
how to call the embassy.

313
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,458
- I'll find out.
- Please. Thank you.

314
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:05,541
Yes.

315
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:17,708
It's ringing.

316
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,916
Hello.

317
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:35,041
- Yes, yeah, I… I need… I need help. Yeah.
<i>- How may I help?</i>

318
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:37,291
I'm up in the mountains
outside of Ioannina.

319
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,166
There's a local police officer...

320
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,833
No, there's two… there's
two local police officers and a woman.

321
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:46,083
Okay? They're trying to kill me.
I don't know why.

322
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:48,708
<i>Okay,</i>
<i>just explain what happened.</i>

323
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:52,500
I'm… I'm… I'm a US citizen.

324
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,333
I was vacationing with my girlfriend.

325
00:39:57,958 --> 00:39:59,541
We got in a car accident.

326
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:02,708
She died.

327
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,875
Then I was attacked by a stranger.

328
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:08,833
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

329
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:10,875
I'm…

330
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,050
Where is this place?
What is the place called?

331
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:16,125
- We're close to Metsovo.
- I'm close to Metsovo.

332
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:20,333
Please, can you…
can you just come and get me?

333
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,750
Send somebody to come and get me
and bring me in safely.

334
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:25,166
Can you do that, please?

335
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,000
<i>It'd take time</i>
<i>to get to you.</i>

336
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:28,083
How long?

337
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:31,625
<i>A day at least.</i>

338
00:40:31,708 --> 00:40:32,708
A day?

339
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:36,125
<i>Do you have</i>
<i>anywhere you can go you would feel safe</i>

340
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:38,041
<i>until we can get someone to you?</i>

341
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,000
Can I come to you?

342
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:44,309
<i>- </i><i>If you are...</i>
- What's your name?

343
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:46,541
Who do I ask for
when I get to the embassy?

344
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:49,958
<i>Officer Majessy.</i>

345
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:52,166
Officer Majessy, I'll see you soon.

346
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:56,666
- What's the fastest way to Athens?
- By car. It's about five hours.

347
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,208
- Five hours.
- By car?

348
00:40:58,291 --> 00:40:59,291
Yes.

349
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,166
Five hours.

350
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,041
Look, don't get this wrong way,
we just can't...

351
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:11,916
No, I understand, not by car.
I understand

352
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,750
- Then, with train from Kalambaka.
- From where?

353
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:18,125
- Kalambaka.
- How far is the train station? Kalambaka?

354
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:19,208
- It's far.
- It's far.

355
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:21,041
It's at the bottom of the valley.

356
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:27,666
- The road by the river?
- This road. Follow the river, yes.

357
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,750
It's too far to walk there.

358
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,666
I'll figure something out. Here.

359
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:37,750
Thank you so much.
Don't tell anybody that you helped me!

360
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:40,166
- Okay? All right? It'll help my chances.
- Take care.

361
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,250
Okay.

362
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:47,375
You speak English?

363
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:48,875
Yes.

364
00:42:49,916 --> 00:42:51,666
- Are you with this bus?
- Yes.

365
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:55,166
Please, I need to get to Kalambaka

366
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:57,583
or any train station
that can get me to Athens.

367
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,125
The man with the bees
told us you called the embassy.

368
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:46,041
Now, what did you say in that phone call?

369
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:49,625
- Did you hurt those people?
- Mmm, yeah.

370
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,583
Who'd you talk to?

371
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,500
I was…

372
00:46:54,666 --> 00:46:57,066
I wasn't on the phone very long, okay?
I wasn't given a name.

373
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:59,041
Mm-hmm. And what'd you say about us?

374
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,291
I said I'd explain everything
to them when I got there.

375
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:04,208
Okay.

376
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:08,059
Look, I'm not the person you want,
all right? There's been a mistake.

377
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:11,166
- You don't want me.
- Now if you make a scene, I will tase you.

378
00:47:11,791 --> 00:47:16,333
Have you ever been tased? It's horrible.
You piss yourself. You shit your pants...

379
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:18,791
This man's trying to kill me!

380
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:53,458
He's harmless.

381
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:52,208
I didn't pull the trigger.
I was just trying to protect myself.

382
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:56,416
<i>You have to turn</i>
<i>yourself in to the local police now.</i>

383
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,333
If I do that, I'll be dead in 30 minutes
or less. You know I can't do that.

384
00:49:00,416 --> 00:49:03,583
<i>Whatever legal assistance</i>
<i>you require, we can provide it to you.</i>

385
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:05,500
<i>We can answer any questions.</i>

386
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:07,250
How about this? How about this question?

387
00:49:07,333 --> 00:49:09,250
How the hell
did I get into this situation?

388
00:49:16,666 --> 00:49:19,375
I have things I have to do.
I… I… I can't...

389
00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:25,083
<i>Listen, you just admitted</i>
<i>to shooting a police officer.</i>

390
00:49:25,166 --> 00:49:26,000
I need help.

391
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:28,875
<i>The best thing you can do</i>
<i>is go to the local authorities.</i>

392
00:49:28,958 --> 00:49:29,958
I need help.

393
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:34,375
<i>We can only help you</i>
<i>after you've turned yourself in.</i>

394
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:36,666
I can't stay here.

395
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:38,666
I can't stay here.

396
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:40,083
Hey, Eleni! This is pointless.

397
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:42,041
Come on, let's go.

398
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,250
Bye-bye.

399
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:47,333
Goodbye.

400
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:52,375
Excuse me.

401
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:54,750
Excuse me.

402
00:50:59,041 --> 00:51:02,250
Hello. Hi. Excuse me.
Do you speak English?

403
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:03,875
Do you speak English?

404
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:06,875
Yes? What are these posters?

405
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:10,500
That's for the Karras rally
today in Athens.

406
00:51:10,583 --> 00:51:12,041
No, I mean... Okay.

407
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:14,916
This boy. Who is this boy?

408
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,041
That's Dimos, Karras' nephew.

409
00:51:17,125 --> 00:51:19,875
Well, I… I'm a tourist.
I don't understand.

410
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:21,416
What does that mean?

411
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,833
This boy was kidnapped,

412
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:25,625
and he's the nephew
of a famous politician, all right?

413
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:30,583
People need to understand what's
happening to try and bring Karras down.

414
00:51:36,791 --> 00:51:39,166
- What is it?
- I've seen him.

415
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:41,208
What?

416
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:43,000
I've seen this boy.

417
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,750
You've seen Dimos Karras?

418
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:51,750
- In the mountains. There're cops involved.
- Is that why your hands are cuffed?

419
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,333
I've been running.

420
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:58,875
My girlfriend and I were
in a car accident, and we hit a house.

421
00:51:58,958 --> 00:52:01,583
That's where I saw the boy, in that house.

422
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:04,666
There's been a woman and a cop
trying to kill me ever since.

423
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,250
And you think these people have the boy?

424
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,250
They must.

425
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:13,083
I need your help. I need a ride to Athens.

426
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:15,583
That's where the US Embassy is.
You understand?

427
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:18,083
They can help me.
The US Embassy in Athens.

428
00:52:18,166 --> 00:52:21,375
- If he's saying the truth...
- That's a big if.

429
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:24,791
Yes, but this could change
everything, even save the boy.

430
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:27,125
- Please.
- You could be full of shit.

431
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:41,541
The woman who's after you, is she blond?

432
00:52:45,166 --> 00:52:48,208
Okay. Get in the trunk of the car.

433
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:56,833
Fuck.

434
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,708
What the hell are you doing?

435
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:02,541
- Wa… wa…
- Did you pee?

436
00:53:02,625 --> 00:53:06,000
I hope you did, 'cause I'm not going
to stop every 20 minutes again.

437
00:53:08,291 --> 00:53:10,500
We don't speak Greek.

438
00:53:10,583 --> 00:53:12,958
We're searching for a black guy.
He's under arrest.

439
00:53:13,666 --> 00:53:16,000
He shot a police officer.
Have you seen him?

440
00:53:16,583 --> 00:53:17,583
Oh, that guy!

441
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:20,142
Where did you see him?

442
00:53:36,416 --> 00:53:39,375
We're going to drive a little out of town,
and then we let you out.

443
00:53:39,458 --> 00:53:40,916
If you hear me, knock once.

444
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:54,166
- What are we supposed to do now?
- Start it.

445
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,583
I don't like this at all.
I'm scared.

446
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,684
Just drive. Okay?

447
00:53:58,708 --> 00:53:59,708
Okay, okay.

448
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:01,833
Everything's all right now.
It's fine.

449
00:54:22,166 --> 00:54:23,208
Was she angry?

450
00:54:23,291 --> 00:54:25,875
She'll understand
when we tell her everything later.

451
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:27,916
She said to meet at Alex's shop.

452
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,666
Alex's shop?
I don't remember where that is.

453
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,958
On Pireos Street, by the hands.
The praying hands.

454
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:37,333
I can take that off if you like.

455
00:54:38,416 --> 00:54:39,416
Thank you.

456
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,125
Okay. Hold still.

457
00:54:52,416 --> 00:54:54,791
You better not be lying to us
about any of this.

458
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,083
I'm not that creative. Believe me.

459
00:54:57,958 --> 00:55:00,708
Well, you left out the part
about shooting a cop.

460
00:55:00,791 --> 00:55:04,041
No. No, no, I didn't shoot him.
Okay, well, I didn't mean to shoot him.

461
00:55:04,125 --> 00:55:07,541
He was drawing his gun on me.
I was just trying to get away from him.

462
00:55:07,625 --> 00:55:08,875
It was only his foot.

463
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:10,666
What a relief.

464
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:14,041
The woman you were talking to,
is she… is she police too?

465
00:55:14,666 --> 00:55:15,666
No.

466
00:55:16,208 --> 00:55:18,333
I had to deal with enough police
in my life

467
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:20,291
to know that she was something else.

468
00:55:22,458 --> 00:55:23,458
But she was armed.

469
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:27,375
Okay. Hold it.

470
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:33,066
This will help.

471
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,125
Are we in danger?

472
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:42,125
Are we?

473
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:48,833
They know where I'm trying to go.
They'll be waiting.

474
00:55:49,458 --> 00:55:51,500
So, we have to be very, very careful.

475
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:10,875
They're discussing the kidnapping.
The possible political motivations.

476
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:11,958
Nothing new.

477
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:16,791
It has to be them, right?

478
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:18,333
Maybe.

479
00:56:18,916 --> 00:56:20,041
We don't know.

480
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:22,583
She was armed.
He said they have cop connections.

481
00:56:23,583 --> 00:56:27,208
She certainly looked like a fascist,
and they have Dimos.

482
00:56:27,291 --> 00:56:29,375
Do you know
who these people could possibly be?

483
00:56:29,458 --> 00:56:31,958
Well, there's a group called Sunrise.

484
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:35,291
They're far-right,
ultranationalist Greeks.

485
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:39,208
They have the police in their pocket.
They get away with everything.

486
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:42,416
So far, no one has claimed responsibility
for the kidnapping,

487
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,541
but it's very likely to be them.

488
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,541
The boy's uncle
understands people's anger.

489
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:52,708
He's building a coalition to reverse
the austerity measures imposed on Greece

490
00:56:52,791 --> 00:56:55,958
by the European Union
and bring us out of the current bullshit.

491
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:57,750
That's if he gets elected.

492
00:56:57,833 --> 00:57:01,291
And that's why we're going to Athens,
because there's a rally for Karras

493
00:57:01,375 --> 00:57:02,791
for the upcoming elections.

494
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,416
Wait, where's the rally?

495
00:57:07,208 --> 00:57:08,541
Syntagma Square. Why?

496
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:13,708
A lot of people think they're
trying to scare him into stepping down,

497
00:57:13,791 --> 00:57:17,500
and the police, I hope they do
what they have to and protect him.

498
00:57:22,583 --> 00:57:23,583
Are you okay?

499
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:27,416
Beckett, breathe.

500
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:30,333
- Should I pull over?
- No. No, no. Go on.

501
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:42,958
It's okay, you're in the car. You're safe.

502
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,666
Okay? Breathe.

503
00:57:47,416 --> 00:57:48,416
Breathe.

504
00:58:00,625 --> 00:58:02,750
What happened
to your girlfriend?

505
00:58:04,083 --> 00:58:07,583
We weren't supposed
to be on that road.

506
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,666
We were staying at Syntagma Square.
Our balcony overlooked it.

507
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:20,083
Somebody told us
that there was a protest coming.

508
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,333
Then they… they told us
it was gonna be very loud,

509
00:58:25,416 --> 00:58:26,958
so, you know, we… we…

510
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:32,291
We left.

511
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:40,458
You should lie down.

512
00:58:40,541 --> 00:58:42,500
Lie down.

513
00:58:44,458 --> 00:58:45,916
We still have some way to go.

514
00:58:52,791 --> 00:58:55,458
It's okay. It's okay.

515
00:59:09,875 --> 00:59:12,708
We need to remember
where that is, Alex's shop.

516
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:29,791
Oh!

517
00:59:30,708 --> 00:59:31,708
Are you okay?

518
00:59:33,708 --> 00:59:35,083
Here, take this.

519
00:59:37,291 --> 00:59:40,458
- What's this?
- What's going on? Is there an accident?

520
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:43,250
I don't know.
There's police on the road.

521
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:45,750
They're checking cars.

522
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,291
What do we do now?

523
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:51,875
You don't think
it has something to do with him?

524
00:59:54,583 --> 00:59:55,583
Thank you.

525
01:01:23,708 --> 01:01:26,000
- Hi. Hi.
- Can I help you?

526
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,875
Yes, the US Embassy, please.

527
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:31,541
- Omonia Station.
- No, the US Embassy.

528
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:35,750
Omonia Station. You want
a 90-minute ticket or a 24-hour ticket?

529
01:01:36,666 --> 01:01:37,666
Ninety.

530
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:40,250
One euro and 20.

531
01:05:10,708 --> 01:05:13,166
Help! Help me! He's got a knife!

532
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:14,708
- What happened?
- Help!

533
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:20,625
Help me!

534
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:26,208
Somebody, call the police!

535
01:05:26,291 --> 01:05:29,500
I need the US… US Embass...
No, please, I just...

536
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:43,333
One minute, sir.

537
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:00,726
- Can you please not cover that?
- I'm so sorry.

538
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:02,625
- Thank you. Thank you.
- I'm sorry.

539
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Beckett.

540
01:06:17,041 --> 01:06:19,458
I'm Steve Majessy. We spoke on the phone.

541
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:22,875
Oh.

542
01:06:24,416 --> 01:06:27,541
We're gonna get you cleaned up.
We're gonna get you better.

543
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:29,083
Don't worry about it.

544
01:06:29,166 --> 01:06:30,166
Thank you.

545
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:46,916
You know he doesn't know
about that yet. Poor guy.

546
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,750
Yes. I gotta go. I will. Bye.

547
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:52,458
Beckett.

548
01:06:53,666 --> 01:06:54,666
Stephen Tynan.

549
01:06:55,333 --> 01:06:56,375
Hi.

550
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,625
I hear you've been through hell.

551
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:01,583
First things first…

552
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
April Hanson.

553
01:07:05,916 --> 01:07:07,000
We located her.

554
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:12,375
Apparently, the office
in Ioannina refused the body.

555
01:07:12,458 --> 01:07:15,500
When they found out she was
a US citizen, contacted us.

556
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,750
So, she was brought to the embassy.

557
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,416
She got here about an hour before you did.

558
01:07:21,625 --> 01:07:24,208
- She's here? She's here in this building?
- Yes.

559
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:27,208
We'll help arrange everything
to get her back home.

560
01:07:27,291 --> 01:07:29,131
We've already been in contact
with her parents,

561
01:07:29,166 --> 01:07:32,916
which is legal for us to do
in a complicated case like this.

562
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:36,541
Um, I need to see her.

563
01:07:38,208 --> 01:07:39,291
Absolutely.

564
01:07:40,041 --> 01:07:41,458
Would you come with me?

565
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:37,041
I wanna bring her home.

566
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,500
Of course.

567
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:42,333
Uh, as soon as that's possible,
given what's happening.

568
01:08:51,458 --> 01:08:53,291
I'm so sorry for your loss, Beckett.

569
01:08:53,791 --> 01:08:56,625
Let's just talk,
get all this straight.

570
01:08:56,708 --> 01:09:00,125
Now, the sooner we do that, the sooner
we can get you both back on your way.

571
01:10:07,375 --> 01:10:10,166
So… you were saying?

572
01:10:13,416 --> 01:10:17,416
Um… then, uh, I crawled out of the car,

573
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:21,125
and that's when I saw the redheaded boy.

574
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:25,291
A couple days later, I… I went back there.

575
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:27,333
You went back there? Why?

576
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:41,333
To see.

577
01:10:42,541 --> 01:10:43,666
To see what?

578
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:50,916
I didn't know what I had to do.

579
01:10:56,416 --> 01:10:57,708
I went back there…

580
01:11:01,416 --> 01:11:02,833
because that was the place…

581
01:11:04,833 --> 01:11:05,833
where I…

582
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:19,791
It was my fault.

583
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,250
The accident, it was, uh…

584
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:31,458
It was my fault.

585
01:11:40,333 --> 01:11:42,666
And… and then, um…

586
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:46,500
…uh, that's where they found me.

587
01:11:49,583 --> 01:11:53,041
A woman and a cop,
they… they started shooting at me.

588
01:11:53,125 --> 01:11:55,958
And I… on sight, and I just… I just ran.

589
01:11:56,541 --> 01:11:57,708
And they followed me,

590
01:11:57,791 --> 01:12:01,250
and they… they forced their way
into a house that I was hiding in.

591
01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:04,041
And God only knows
what… what they did to the man there

592
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:06,958
that was taking care of me
at the time. Uh…

593
01:12:08,291 --> 01:12:10,208
And they found me on a train.

594
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:11,666
Where you shot the cop?

595
01:12:12,375 --> 01:12:15,333
They were waiting for me,
there at the station.

596
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:18,791
And, uh, near the embassy here.

597
01:12:20,291 --> 01:12:22,416
Well…

598
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,208
How did you get to Athens?

599
01:12:25,083 --> 01:12:28,833
Uh, I got a ride,
uh, a couple of activists.

600
01:12:30,666 --> 01:12:33,000
They were headed
to the, uh… the Karras rally.

601
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:36,166
That's the reason
I found out who the boy was.

602
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:38,500
They said
that the… the people that were chasing me

603
01:12:38,583 --> 01:12:40,791
were part of a group, uh, called, uh,

604
01:12:41,583 --> 01:12:44,083
uh, Sunrise. Or… or Pro-Sunrise.

605
01:12:44,666 --> 01:12:46,833
Were you able to get their names?

606
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:53,458
Lena and Eleni.

607
01:12:56,041 --> 01:12:59,083
Hmm.
And do you think Lena and Eleni

608
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:02,458
would go to the police
on their own or the press?

609
01:13:03,166 --> 01:13:04,166
I… I don't know.

610
01:13:04,791 --> 01:13:06,958
Well, if I wanted to find them,
could I?

611
01:13:07,458 --> 01:13:09,791
I'd like to get statements
from them anyway.

612
01:13:09,875 --> 01:13:11,625
Anyone who can go on record

613
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:14,791
that will vouch for you
will help speed this up, Beckett.

614
01:13:14,875 --> 01:13:16,333
Okay. All right.

615
01:13:17,708 --> 01:13:18,708
Um…

616
01:13:19,458 --> 01:13:23,166
They said, um… they said
they were going to meet at a shop,

617
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:25,083
uh, near the praying hands.

618
01:13:25,958 --> 01:13:28,208
"Praying hands,"
do you know what that means?

619
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:30,416
Um… maybe.

620
01:13:31,041 --> 01:13:34,875
Okay, so…

621
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:39,625
It's not Sunrise
that's after you.

622
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:43,791
The activists think that because
it suits their political narrative.

623
01:13:43,875 --> 01:13:46,875
They also think they can wave
a magic crisis wand called Karras,

624
01:13:46,958 --> 01:13:49,916
and Greece's austerity measures
will just go away.

625
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
They are…

626
01:13:51,458 --> 01:13:53,916
They don't have
the whole picture.

627
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,958
- Then, who's after me?
- Can you identify the cop?

628
01:13:58,083 --> 01:14:00,416
- Yes, I sa… I said I can.
- Okay.

629
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,041
Here's what we're going to do.

630
01:14:03,125 --> 01:14:05,791
I know plenty of Greek cops
who won't try to kill you.

631
01:14:06,291 --> 01:14:08,833
I'll take you to one of them.
You'll fill her in on everything.

632
01:14:08,916 --> 01:14:10,166
I'll vouch for you.

633
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:12,708
Since you're not a diplomat,
we can't override

634
01:14:12,791 --> 01:14:17,083
whatever alerts the Greek police
have out on you, but she can.

635
01:14:18,458 --> 01:14:21,291
- A… all right, but can this cop come here?
- Uh…

636
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:24,375
You know, it doesn't work that way.

637
01:14:24,458 --> 01:14:26,684
Well, I really don't want
to leave the embassy.

638
01:14:26,708 --> 01:14:29,791
Look, I know you're scared. I get it.

639
01:14:32,041 --> 01:14:33,875
I'm gonna be with you the whole way.

640
01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:37,708
To… to the end of this.

641
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:41,750
No alcohol. I'm on medication.
Nurse's orders.

642
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:43,333
Smart. I like that.

643
01:14:45,291 --> 01:14:46,458
We'll take my car.

644
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:49,083
It's unmarked. Tinted windows.

645
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:52,458
Well, can we at least
have an escort with us?

646
01:14:52,541 --> 01:14:54,791
It's not my personal car.
It's a civilian car.

647
01:14:54,875 --> 01:14:57,583
But it belongs to the embassy.
It's prepped, level six.

648
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:00,750
It's bulletproof.

649
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,708
Are they gonna be able
to help the boy? Dimos?

650
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:08,541
Unlikely.

651
01:15:09,375 --> 01:15:10,375
Shall we?

652
01:15:26,208 --> 01:15:28,916
<i>… and breathing.</i>
<i>Doing exercise early</i>

653
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,125
<i>also ensures a healthy propulsion
of all the body systems.</i>

654
01:15:47,416 --> 01:15:50,750
You'll be back in Ohio
selling software again in no time.

655
01:15:53,666 --> 01:15:55,250
What you do there, right?

656
01:15:56,208 --> 01:15:58,333
No, business systems integration.

657
01:15:58,416 --> 01:15:59,833
Look at you.

658
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:05,541
Uh, it must nearly be time.

659
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:11,000
Karras' rally.
They're out here in full force, huh?

660
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:15,250
Okay, I see you. Yeah.
Don't worry. Doors are locked.

661
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:20,958
Fuck. Goddamn it.

662
01:16:24,416 --> 01:16:26,500
Jesus fucking Christ.

663
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:28,083
Sorry.

664
01:16:29,125 --> 01:16:30,685
Just wanna make sure we get there safe.

665
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,125
So, you said you've been
out here four months, yeah?

666
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:49,750
Four? No, eight.

667
01:16:51,291 --> 01:16:52,500
- Really?
- Yeah.

668
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:59,500
- Well, how much further is she?
- Huh?

669
01:16:59,583 --> 01:17:02,541
Your… your contact, uh, how much…
Where… She works out here?

670
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:06,875
Oh, yeah, yeah. She's an honest cop,
so they gave her a shit post.

671
01:17:06,958 --> 01:17:09,791
You know how it goes.
The good guys get screwed, right?

672
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:13,642
<i>Breaking news from Greece</i>
<i>on the Karras kidnapping case.</i>

673
01:17:13,666 --> 01:17:14,500
Oh, listen.

674
01:17:14,583 --> 01:17:17,023
<i>A call was received</i>
<i>claiming credit for the abduction.</i>

675
01:17:17,083 --> 01:17:19,708
<i>The caller, who was described
as having a foreign accent,</i>

676
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:23,375
<i>stated he was a spokesman
for the extreme leftist organization</i>

677
01:17:23,458 --> 01:17:25,291
<i>known as the Communist Brigade.</i>

678
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,750
<i>He announced
that demands would follow soon.</i>

679
01:17:27,833 --> 01:17:31,250
<i>This casts a bad light on Karras,
as he had declared the group's separation</i>

680
01:17:31,333 --> 01:17:34,083
<i>from his coalition to be
a peaceful and strategic one,</i>

681
01:17:34,166 --> 01:17:37,666
<i>painting a false picture of unity
among the diverse elements of his party.</i>

682
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:42,333
That sounds like Karras' leftist coalition
isn't as coalesced as he'd hoped.

683
01:17:42,416 --> 01:17:44,125
<i>…sentiment</i>
<i>among Karras supporters…</i>

684
01:17:48,875 --> 01:17:52,208
So, the Communists,
they're the ones trying to kill me?

685
01:17:57,958 --> 01:17:59,000
Shortcut.

686
01:18:02,041 --> 01:18:03,416
Little faster this way.

687
01:18:10,083 --> 01:18:12,625
The station's
at the other end of this road.

688
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:21,166
Really sorry about this.

689
01:20:59,833 --> 01:21:02,250
Yes, but you're German. Why come at all?

690
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:06,208
Because I am German. I want my government
to see that I stand with the Greek

691
01:21:06,291 --> 01:21:10,333
and not with the financial establishment
and excessive austerity measures.

692
01:21:10,916 --> 01:21:14,375
- You know what I mean?
- Hey! What are you doing here?

693
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:15,666
Beckett?

694
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:17,976
I'll explain, but right now,
we gotta get away from here.

695
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,625
- Did you go to the embassy?
- It's all fucked up. I barely escaped.

696
01:21:21,708 --> 01:21:24,791
- We gotta go.
- What? They're also part of this?

697
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:27,500
Someone at an embassy
threatened you? I don't understand.

698
01:21:27,583 --> 01:21:28,416
Gimme the phone.

699
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:31,291
- The American Embassy?
- What? Why didn't they help you?

700
01:21:31,375 --> 01:21:32,375
Listen to me.

701
01:21:32,458 --> 01:21:35,750
They know you're here.
They probably know I'm coming to warn you.

702
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:37,553
We have to get out of here.
We all gotta go.

703
01:21:37,583 --> 01:21:39,416
Shit.

704
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,791
- There's a door at the back.
- What about you?

705
01:21:41,875 --> 01:21:44,208
We have the press.
See you at the rally!

706
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:50,375
Okay, we're safe, okay?
We have the press. It's fine.

707
01:21:57,333 --> 01:21:59,041
- Who are you?
- Oh, you don't wanna know.

708
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:06,250
Beckett!

709
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:28,333
Come on! Let's go!

710
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:38,416
Fuck!

711
01:22:39,916 --> 01:22:40,916
Goddamn it.

712
01:23:19,416 --> 01:23:20,416
Hey!

713
01:23:28,291 --> 01:23:29,291
Fuck.

714
01:23:57,541 --> 01:23:59,083
I… I need the bike! I need...

715
01:25:14,708 --> 01:25:19,875
Karras!
Karras! Karras! Karras!

716
01:27:01,708 --> 01:27:02,833
Have you seen, um…

717
01:27:03,333 --> 01:27:05,958
Have you see the man with the cast?

718
01:27:57,166 --> 01:27:59,541
Appreciate you moving us
out of public view.

719
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:04,250
You fucked up my face, man.

720
01:28:04,333 --> 01:28:06,958
You don't deserve a face like… like that.

721
01:28:07,041 --> 01:28:09,833
You don't deserve to get shot
in the cellar of a mall.

722
01:28:09,916 --> 01:28:12,000
Hold it right there.

723
01:28:14,125 --> 01:28:15,333
Maybe I do.

724
01:28:15,416 --> 01:28:17,833
Oh, that's the red phone ring.

725
01:28:18,583 --> 01:28:20,000
I gotta get that one.

726
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:24,125
Yeah.

727
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:27,291
You're shitting me. I'm right under it.

728
01:28:28,041 --> 01:28:29,041
It just happened?

729
01:28:30,333 --> 01:28:31,375
Shit.

730
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:36,500
Okay.

731
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:40,250
Okay, uh, what do you want me to do
about, uh, tragedy boy here?

732
01:28:42,958 --> 01:28:44,416
Sounds about right to me.

733
01:28:45,083 --> 01:28:46,083
Okay.

734
01:28:46,791 --> 01:28:47,791
Over and out.

735
01:28:56,291 --> 01:28:58,000
Whoa! Hold up! Hold up!

736
01:28:58,083 --> 01:29:00,166
Hold up! Beckett, stop!

737
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:03,541
I'm not gonna fucking do anything to you.
Calm down.

738
01:29:05,416 --> 01:29:08,083
Karras is dead. He's dead.
That's what that call was.

739
01:29:08,166 --> 01:29:11,375
He was just shot during his speech.
Just happened.

740
01:29:11,458 --> 01:29:14,250
- Wait, who… who did it?
- Apparently, the people who took your boy.

741
01:29:20,666 --> 01:29:21,666
Tell me what you know.

742
01:29:21,708 --> 01:29:24,125
What do you care? Google it.
You can figure out most of it.

743
01:29:24,208 --> 01:29:27,291
Karras' family's
got a ton of shipping money.

744
01:29:27,375 --> 01:29:30,833
He wanted more, got involved with crooks,
and he owes them.

745
01:29:30,916 --> 01:29:32,750
They want their money back.

746
01:29:33,458 --> 01:29:35,916
The rest is classified.

747
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,500
Taking Dimos wasn't political then?

748
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,750
Just criminals Karras owed,
that's what you're telling me?

749
01:29:45,125 --> 01:29:46,625
Yeah. Classified.

750
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:49,500
So, this is
all just Mafia bullshit?

751
01:29:58,791 --> 01:30:01,291
So, who called and said they were
the Communist Front? You?

752
01:30:01,875 --> 01:30:04,000
- That's classified.
- Of course it is!

753
01:30:05,083 --> 01:30:07,875
- What did you want with me?
- Hey, fucking asshole!

754
01:30:08,458 --> 01:30:12,416
You were going to uncover the real crooks
and fuck with our plan, okay?

755
01:30:12,916 --> 01:30:15,916
We needed someone else to take the blame,
but we're good now.

756
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,916
His coalition can't survive.

757
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,041
You want me
to tell you you were expendable?

758
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:23,083
The wrong man? The wrong place?

759
01:30:23,166 --> 01:30:26,083
Yeah, sure. All of it. But we're good now.

760
01:30:26,166 --> 01:30:29,791
You keep this part between us,
you got nothing to worry about from me.

761
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:33,125
And don't fucking test that.
It would be my word against yours.

762
01:30:33,208 --> 01:30:35,916
I got the cleanest fucking record
you've ever seen.

763
01:30:36,875 --> 01:30:38,458
It's over, all right?

764
01:30:39,791 --> 01:30:41,166
It's over, Beckett.

765
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:43,375
- What about the boy?
- What about him?

766
01:30:44,166 --> 01:30:45,291
Are they gonna kill him?

767
01:30:45,375 --> 01:30:48,375
How should I know? Maybe they have.
Maybe they are right fucking now.

768
01:30:48,458 --> 01:30:50,541
You know what? Go up there and ask them.

769
01:30:50,625 --> 01:30:54,750
But Beckett, at this point,
just get on a fucking plane.

770
01:37:59,875 --> 01:38:00,875
Beckett?

771
01:38:02,625 --> 01:38:04,041
- What happened?
- Wait.

772
01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:46,250
Ah!

773
01:40:10,875 --> 01:40:12,083
Hey! No!

774
01:40:13,125 --> 01:40:14,958
It's okay. Stop.

775
01:40:15,041 --> 01:40:16,916
I know him. It's fine. It's fine.

776
01:40:20,916 --> 01:40:21,791
Okay.

777
01:40:25,583 --> 01:40:26,666
The trunk.

778
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:28,000
- What?
- The trunk.

779
01:40:28,625 --> 01:40:30,625
The trunk?

780
01:40:41,875 --> 01:40:42,875
Oh, fuck.

781
01:40:49,208 --> 01:40:51,458
Dimos Karras.

782
01:40:56,166 --> 01:40:57,166
Okay.

783
01:41:35,583 --> 01:41:37,125
I should have died.

784
01:41:42,291 --> 01:41:43,500
I should have died.

784
