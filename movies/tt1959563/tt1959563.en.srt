00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,145
<i>Good morning, Mr. Bryce.</i>

3
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:44,147
<i>I trust the pickup ran smoothly.</i>

4
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:47,066
Hand-off was clean.
No stops till the exit point.

5
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:52,447
<i>Clear roads all the way, Chief,</i>

6
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:55,241
<i>just as you predicted.</i>

7
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:56,159
Thank you for agreeing

8
00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:58,119
to an earlier departure time,
Mr. Kurosawa.

9
00:01:58,369 --> 00:01:59,680
I'm honored that you and your wives

10
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:01,748
have entrusted
a Triple-A Protection Service today.

11
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:09,464
<i>Moving red to green option,
coming in on your vector.</i>

12
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:12,342
<i>Get the engine started,
I want an immediate takeoff.</i>

13
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:14,201
<i>Air space has already been cleared.</i>

14
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:15,594
<i>Roger that.</i>

15
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:18,139
<i>All channels moving
to restricted air space.</i>

16
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:24,311
Shall we?

17
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:38,910
Mr. Kurosawa...

18
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:50,588
<i>Another
Triple-A delivery, sir.</i>

19
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:51,952
Stay with him
till he's airborne.

20
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,716
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
- Canvas is clear?

21
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:56,594
<i>Nothing for miles, Chief. Almost boring.</i>

22
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:57,845
And what's our motto?

23
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:00,139
Boring is always best.

24
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:11,775
Move! Move!

25
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:13,945
Client down! Client down!

26
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,071
<i>Code seven! Code seven!</i>

27
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:16,321
<i>Jesus!</i>

28
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:18,366
<i>It's like a goddamn milkshake in here!</i>

29
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:19,784
<i>Bravo One down.</i>

30
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:21,744
<i>We need
a clean-up team in here now!</i>

31
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:23,746
<i>Repeat, Bravo One down.</i>

32
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:43,975
<i>♪ There's no one to have fun with ♪</i>

33
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:55,278
<i>♪ Since my baby's love
Has been done with ♪</i>

34
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:05,580
<i>♪ All I do is think of you... ♪</i>

35
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:18,927
Fucking piece of paper I've got here.

36
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:22,472
...I'm gonna beat this motherfucker's...

37
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:27,059
Holy shit.

38
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:33,565
Mr. Seifert.

39
00:04:36,194 --> 00:04:38,404
- Are we ready to go?
- "Are we ready?"

40
00:04:38,655 --> 00:04:39,530
I've been waiting!

41
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:42,241
What the hell took you so long?
It's half past 9:00!

42
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,661
Apologies. I had to make some
preparations... Mr. Seifert.

43
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:45,744
Mr. Seifert!

44
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,600
It's best if I go through doors first.

45
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
- Okay?
- Okay.

46
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:52,603
You don't know what I'm dealing with here.

47
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:53,836
Come on, let's go, let's go.

48
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,837
- Double time.
- You don't understand.

49
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:56,589
These people are animals!

50
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:58,466
They're probably here already,

51
00:04:59,384 --> 00:05:01,528
- just waiting for me to leave.
- I can appreciate your concern,

52
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,346
but I assure you, you are perfectly safe.

53
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:05,563
All you need to do
is exactly what I tell you.

54
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:08,685
Mr. Seifert? Mr. Seifert?
This way, please.

55
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,145
All right. Is it not enough cocaine,
or too much?

56
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:16,734
They say you're Triple-A rated.

57
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,152
Is that a real thing?

58
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:22,073
Let's just focus on you dying
of natural causes, shall we?

59
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:24,242
Soon.

60
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,450
That's my car.

61
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:26,869
Take a mental picture of it.

62
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:28,955
I find it safer if we're using a car

63
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:30,790
that blends in
with the surrounding traffic.

64
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:35,449
Well, that was easy.
In fact, practically nothing at all.

65
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:36,963
Boring is always best.

66
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:38,373
I trust you'll reduce your...

67
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:41,718
- <i>What?</i>
- This is Michael Bryce.

68
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:43,112
I'm an executive protection agent,

69
00:05:43,136 --> 00:05:44,697
fully licensed and bonded within the EU.

70
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:47,515
<i>Fuckin' hell. I know it's you.
I've got caller ID!</i>

71
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:50,601
<i>Such a fucking dick.
You got a pickup for me or what?</i>

72
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:54,522
Yes. I've extracted my client
from 27 Saint George Street.

73
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:55,690
Clean-up is required.

74
00:05:56,858 --> 00:06:00,486
<i>On the seventh floor, north stairwell,
I've left a French national</i>

75
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,113
employed by the Taray Crime Syndicate.

76
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:05,084
<i>You'll find two more
in the south stairwell.</i>

77
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:08,204
<i>On the roof, you're gonna find another
who's gonna need some dental work.</i>

78
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:12,790
<i>In the alley, there's two gentlemen
who may require some counseling.</i>

79
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:18,504
<i>One more in the east office
on the sixth floor under construction</i>

80
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,549
<i>and one on the number three elevator.</i>

81
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:25,803
Oh, oh, oh!

82
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:28,222
<i>Parking garage,
under the Rolls-Royce in space five,</i>

83
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:29,932
<i>there's a pound of plastic explosives,</i>

84
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:31,536
you might want to call the bomb squad.

85
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:35,688
Check that. Make it the fire department.

86
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:36,606
Is that my car?

87
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:39,150
I'm afraid so. Have a seat,
it's been a long day.

88
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:47,033
That was a custom Rolls-Royce,
one of a kind.

89
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:48,806
I thought that was an unusual color.

90
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:49,993
Was that periwinkle?

91
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,288
I did find this in the backseat.

92
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:53,498
Scraps!

93
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:54,581
Precious, aren't they?

94
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:58,419
It smells like ass in here.

95
00:06:58,836 --> 00:06:59,836
Buckle up.

96
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:02,256
This car certainly
isn't Triple-A rated.

97
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,509
It's not even fit for animals.

98
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:37,667
Keep moving!

99
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,378
Everybody go home!

100
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:42,672
Get out of the way!

101
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,597
Have a look there.

102
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,370
Knock on the doors.

103
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:23,253
How's your English?

104
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:29,468
I don't know much English, Mr. President.

105
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:35,057
"The only way for the country to progress

106
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:40,271
is by eradicating the scourge of genocide

107
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:44,233
blackening our country
and our livelihood."

108
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:49,155
.I appreciate your modesty.

109
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:54,994
I hope we're not...
disturbing your family.

110
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:00,333
They are on holiday.

111
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:01,875
Good for them.

112
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:06,088
Family makes a man whole.

113
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:15,473
I could have
you executed for treason,

114
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:20,102
but another would simply stand
a little bit higher on your corpse.

115
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:25,066
There must be some other lesson
I could teach you.

116
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:34,784
As I said,

117
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:38,204
there is nothing more important...

118
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:40,289
than a good education.

119
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:47,587
<i>Professor Asimov,</i>

120
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:50,675
can you please tell the court
what happened next?

121
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:54,261
Then... I was taken

122
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:56,764
to one of Dukhovich's internment camps.

123
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:01,268
I was there for three years

124
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:05,690
until he was finally overthrown.

125
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:10,277
Arrested like the monster he is.

126
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:14,156
Thank you, Professor Asimov.

127
00:10:14,824 --> 00:10:18,869
Your Honor, I request
that this entire testimony be disregarded.

128
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:22,373
Without any evidence,
this is merely hearsay.

129
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:24,792
Sustained.

130
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,627
<i>The trial
of former Belarusian President</i>

131
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:28,546
<i>Vladislav Dukhovich continued today</i>

132
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,424
<i>with emotional testimony
from many of his country's victims.</i>

133
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,635
But while powerful to hear,
Dukhovich's attorneys say

134
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:37,221
they are nothing more
than the lies of his enemies.

135
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,807
Long one of the world's
most brutal dictators...

136
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,476
Who stands accused
of ethnic cleansing on a massive scale.

137
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,813
An unprecedented level of security
is in place around the courthouse.

138
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:48,357
Even the airspace
above this city is closed.

139
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,901
So far, the prosecution
has been crippled by the lack

140
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:52,903
of any hard evidence
against Dukhovich himself.

141
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:54,488
Numerous witnesses

142
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:56,615
who were expected
to testify have disappeared.

143
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:59,744
Is there anyone brave enough
to come forward with evidence

144
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:02,246
and finally put an end
to his brutal reign?

145
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:21,807
Mr. Kincaid,
this is Interpol's offer.

146
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:25,102
In return for your testimony
against former President Dukhovich,

147
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:28,647
your wife will receive a full
pardon from all jurisdictions.

148
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,652
You're going to pardon an innocent woman?

149
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:37,013
That's mighty fucking white of you.

150
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,742
Assuming we accept this arrangement

151
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,118
for Sonia Kincaid,

152
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,413
there's still the matter
of an agreement regarding my client.

153
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,460
He will receive

154
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,216
this letter recommending leniency.

155
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,384
Mr. Kincaid is a contract killer

156
00:11:57,468 --> 00:11:59,887
facing two dozen counts
of murder in ten countries.

157
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,680
Absent a legitimate deal,

158
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:04,266
he will never breathe free air again.
Under no...

159
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:13,859
Sonia goes free.

160
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:17,822
We're all set, Director Casoria.

161
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:20,491
Let's get this gentleman to The Hague.

162
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:32,044
Mr. Kincaid,
this is Agent Roussel.

163
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:34,272
She'll be leading a security detail,

164
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:37,424
which will escort you
to the International Criminal Court.

165
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:42,388
You know, Dukhovich's men have killed
every single witness brought against them,

166
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:45,391
and my security detail
is a dozen off-duty cops?

167
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:49,186
These are the most highly-trained officers
in Europe, Mr. Kincaid.

168
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,938
We have taken every precaution

169
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,732
to make sure that your involvement
is completely classified.

170
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,442
It's a secret?

171
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:58,112
That makes me feel so much better.

172
00:12:58,404 --> 00:12:59,488
Well, I can assure you,

173
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:01,365
even if there was an attempt,

174
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,506
we're more than prepared for any assault.

175
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,955
You prepared for that assault,
motherfucker?

176
00:13:08,581 --> 00:13:12,459
Uncuff me, give me some car keys,
a couple guns, I'll meet you guys there.

177
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:15,421
The court's deadline
is at 5:00 p.m. tomorrow, Mr. Kincaid.

178
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:20,301
That gives us 27 hours to transport
you from Manchester to the Netherlands.

179
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:24,889
If you want to help your wife,
you should get moving.

180
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:29,351
Okay, Inspector Clouseau,

181
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:31,687
let's see what these elite troops
of yours can do.

182
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:33,354
Come on, guys, let's go.

183
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Agent Roussel,

184
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,487
I don't have to remind
you of the importance of this.

185
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:43,741
- No, ma'am.
- And don't doubt what he's capable of.

186
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,491
I won't, sir.

187
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:13,729
<i>- Take a left on Kirkland Avenue.
- Yes.</i>

188
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:20,694
What a pretty little town.
Old, narrow streets,

189
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:22,780
buildings nice and close,

190
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,699
lots of great views
from all those windows.

191
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:27,326
This route's been wiped clean for us.

192
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,410
Nothing to worry about.

193
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:29,870
Is that right?

194
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,705
How's that nose of yours doing?

195
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,509
<i>Take a diversion route.</i>

196
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,511
Got a boyfriend, Roussie?
Significant other?

197
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,846
I need you to be quiet, Mr. Kincaid.

198
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,015
I'm just saying,
now might be the perfect time

199
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:52,226
to write one of those
"I'll always love you" texts.

200
00:14:56,272 --> 00:14:58,274
Relax, motherfucker.

201
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:00,818
If you hear the shot,
it wasn't meant for you.

202
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,572
<i>Two-two-one,
ten-four en route.</i>

203
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,681
Fuck!

204
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,141
Cover me!

205
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:33,350
Move! Move!

206
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:42,735
Cover me!

207
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,756
Move! Move!
Go! Get that door open!

208
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:06,967
Go! Go! Alpha Squad, with me!

209
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,345
Agent Roberts, protect the witness!

210
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:16,518
Parker, take the left flank!

211
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,783
Shit! We need more backup!

212
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,537
Follow me!

213
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:37,039
Fuck!

214
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:01,188
Agent Roussel!
God damn it, somebody!

215
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:02,564
We need backup n...

216
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:10,071
Turn around!

217
00:17:10,406 --> 00:17:11,281
It's ready!

218
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:12,491
Come on!

219
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:24,420
Lay down some cover fire.

220
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:56,285
Fuck!

221
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,140
- Show me your hands!
- Bitch, please!

222
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:21,435
- Put these on.
- Fuck that.

223
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,270
Interpol's compromised. You know that.

224
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,773
Either you shoot me or watch me bleed out.

225
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,407
We gotta get off the street.

226
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:37,011
There's a safe house
not far from here.

227
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:44,750
<i>As a car bomb has
exploded in Bishopgate Green,</i>

228
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,752
<i>near Coventry City Center...</i>

229
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,675
Don't even think
about answering that fucking phone!

230
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:56,558
The only way Dukhovich
could've known our route

231
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:58,430
was if he had somebody on the inside.

232
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:01,642
Now, I need medical supplies,
and you need help.

233
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,602
So, if you're gonna call somebody,

234
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,896
they have to be totally out of the loop.

235
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,151
I've had
the Black Diamond service

236
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:12,694
four times now, you understand?

237
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:15,364
Four times. The car still
smells like a cemetery.

238
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,534
Are you washing the car with old assholes?

239
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:20,619
Or...

240
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,079
Just help me to understand.

241
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,790
Just a second here.

242
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:28,669
Hello, Amelia.

243
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:30,629
I'm texting you an address in Coventry.

244
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,440
You need to get there immediately.

245
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,383
Bring three units of O-negative blood.

246
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:37,386
I'm doing very well, thank you.
How are you?

247
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,721
I don't have
the time for this, Michael.

248
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:41,431
I have a job I need you to do.

249
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,810
- Pass.
- I wasn't offering. I'm telling you.

250
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,353
I have a job you're going to do.

251
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,730
<i>I'm not gonna let you charm me
into this one, Amelia.</i>

252
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:50,232
Okay, let's be clear.

253
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,335
I'm not any happier about this
than you are,

254
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,610
but I don't have a choice.

255
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,571
Well, thank God I do.

256
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,071
<i>No, Michael, you don't.</i>

257
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,324
<i>Because if you're not
where I need you to be,</i>

258
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:01,410
<i>I'm going to expose
you and your work to Interpol.</i>

259
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,496
That elite Triple-A status
you want back so badly,

260
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:07,635
- I'll make sure you never get near it.
- You're threatening me now?

261
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,835
Not you, her. Are you threatening...

262
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:12,078
You can't just threaten me
into taking orders from you.

263
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:15,066
I guess we'll see. You're three hours
away. I'll see you in two and a half.

264
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,718
Three... Okay, okay.
I guess we will. Jesus Christ.

265
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,596
Here, we're gonna load
all these into the car, okay?

266
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,247
We're gonna take the car out in the front,
and then burn it.

267
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,518
This place is like a war zone.

268
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,061
We got bodies everywhere.

269
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,980
Our unit's compromised. Everyone's down.

270
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,523
Get those guys IDed.

271
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,483
And I've got no sign of Agent Roussel.

272
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,570
Maybe 15 to 20
dead mercenaries, heavily armed.

273
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,572
Media circus is in town.

274
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:40,236
That's not the worst of it.

275
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:44,285
Kincaid is gone.

276
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:47,748
Coventry, every available agent.

277
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,875
Report back to me with any updates.

278
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,208
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

279
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:54,877
There must've been a leak.

280
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:58,342
I told you, there are too many
agencies involved.

281
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,550
Get to The Hague.

282
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:01,405
See what you can get out of Dukhovich.

283
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:02,845
I'll try.

284
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:05,349
And alert the penitentiary in Amsterdam.

285
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,727
Have them triple the guard
around Kincaid's wife.

286
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:09,226
Got it.

287
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,795
Mrs. Kincaid, your attorney.

288
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:54,293
Did I tell you you could turn around?

289
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:01,446
What do you want,
you useless piece of shit?

290
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:03,657
Baby, baby, it's me.

291
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,951
My bad.

292
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:07,744
What do you want,

293
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:10,580
you fucking <i>hijo de puta</i> motherfucker!

294
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,499
I just wanted to hear your voice.

295
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:13,582
Fuck you!

296
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,253
There, you heard my voice.

297
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:20,173
<i>The only reason I'm in this shit hole
is so that they can get to your sorry ass!</i>

298
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,844
How you doing? Made a shank yet?

299
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:24,845
<i>What for?</i>

300
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,768
It's prison, baby.
You got to protect yourself.

301
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:28,974
It's a Dutch prison, Darius!

302
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,851
What are they gonna do,
beat me with a clog?

303
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:32,561
You got a view at least?

304
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:35,647
<i>Just a whole lot of corny Dutch buildings.</i>

305
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:40,068
There's one
with a huge fucking clock on it.

306
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:42,404
Like that's what I need right now.

307
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,281
Do they have those flowers you love?

308
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:47,576
Irises?
They come from there, right?

309
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,745
Fucking tulips, Darius.

310
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:52,914
<i>What kind of a piece-of-shit husband</i>

311
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:55,250
<i>doesn't remember
his wife's favorite flowers?</i>

312
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:57,335
<i>You never remember anything.</i>

313
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,045
What's our anniversary?

314
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,630
I'm gonna make this up to you, baby.

315
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:03,049
<i>You see, that's what
I'm talking about,</i> cabrón.

316
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,344
Darius, is something wrong?

317
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:12,601
Not a thing, baby. Not a fucking thing.

318
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:16,897
Then I want to hear it.

- Hello? Sonia?
- Hello? Darius!

324
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,510
You fucking piece of shit!

325
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,139
You fucking shit!

326
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:21,848
Go ahead,
you might as well finish the job.

327
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,267
Why am I here, Amelia?

328
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,185
A high-value transport.

329
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:41,940
Oh, high value? Oh, I don't...

330
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:45,527
I don't really do high value anymore.
These days I'm more in the...

331
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:48,071
mid-level coked-out attorney market.

332
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:50,031
Why do you think that is?

333
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:51,575
Seriously, Michael?

334
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:52,658
Because of you.

335
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:55,620
You used me to climb the Interpol ladder,
and here we are again.

336
00:24:58,832 --> 00:24:59,833
You up for a promotion?

337
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,937
You have to blame me for every little bump
in your road, don't you.

338
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:05,213
No, these aren't bumps. No, no, no bumps.

339
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:07,507
Just one dead Japanese arms dealer.

340
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,819
- I had nothing to do...
- "...to do with."

341
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:11,011
Do you know what happens

342
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:13,972
when a Triple-A rated
executive protection agent

343
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:14,973
loses a client?

344
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,684
Triple-A. I was up here, yeah?

345
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,519
Then I opened up to you. Why wouldn't I?

346
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:20,687
I was in love with you.

347
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:22,647
And I fucking told you his name.

348
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:26,443
It was the first time in my entire career
I revealed a client's name.

349
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:27,693
I trusted you.

350
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:33,325
Now I'm down here. The dead guy's up here.

351
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:37,787
I'm sorry, Michael,
you hit a rough patch.

352
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:39,039
"A rough..."

353
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:43,126
A 300-pound investment banker's ass
exploded four bags of heroin

354
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,711
in the backseat of my car last week.

355
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:46,630
Those aren't leather seats,
those are cloth.

356
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,566
- Okay, Michael...
- Want you to take a minute

357
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,109
to think of what that clean-up might be.

358
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,986
I don't have the time
for your insane shit, okay?

359
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,345
At that point, you sell the car.

360
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:54,822
- I never used you!
- The depreciation...

361
00:25:54,846 --> 00:25:56,056
I just left you!

362
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:03,188
Because you couldn't forgive me
for something I didn't even do.

363
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:12,989
Transport is in there.

364
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:17,951
Is that blood, dude...

365
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,373
What the fuck?

366
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:41,142
You know how long
I've been waiting for this?

367
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:44,771
Oh, no, no. I'm not gonna look.

368
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,857
Motherfucker!

369
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:59,035
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's talk about this, okay?

370
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,581
Even a dumbass like you is smart enough
to keep one in the... pipe.

371
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,126
Oh, shit.

372
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:08,086
And nighty night.

373
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:11,923
- Darius Kincaid. Jesus Christ.
- ...Michael.

374
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:14,008
This is who you want me to protect?
My shirt!

375
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:16,552
Fine, fine.

376
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,847
You get the feet, I'll get the nostrils.

377
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:22,475
<i>The trial
of former Belarusian President</i>

378
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,895
<i>Vladislav Dukhovich
took an uncertain turn this week,</i>

379
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:27,397
<i>having recently survived</i>

380
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,192
<i>a dioxin poisoning attempt
that left his face disfigured.</i>

381
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:34,362
<i>- Authorities are keeping Dukhovich...</i>
- Interpol wishes to have a word.

382
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:36,948
Quite the dust-up in Coventry
this morning.

383
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,821
But you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

384
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:44,873
You've come here to lodge a complaint?

385
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:48,126
I've come for my money.
I delivered as promised.

386
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,962
I gave you Kincaid as exposed
as you'll ever get him.

387
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:53,006
Small security detail,

388
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:54,799
practically a rookie leading them.

389
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:57,969
I can't do more than that.
Let's be fair here.

390
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:11,775
You think it's fair
that you want something for nothing?

391
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:14,611
In my country...

392
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,572
...we would skin you like a cat.

393
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:20,200
Would that be fair?

394
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:26,748
I come from nothing. I work all my life...

395
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:28,708
serving the people.

396
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:31,920
And then they come into my country

397
00:28:32,003 --> 00:28:33,463
and they took it all away!

398
00:28:35,173 --> 00:28:37,717
And now they lock me up like a rat,

399
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:39,719
feed me poison!

400
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:43,263
Is this fair?

401
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,267
When Kincaid is dead,

402
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:50,772
you'll be paid in full.

403
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:55,222
You know he's a murderer, right?

404
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:56,736
You're playing nurse to a murderer.

405
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,404
- A witness. Mmm-hmm.
- Really?

406
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:00,197
Twenty-seven times.

407
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:03,674
That's how many times this asshole
has tried to kill me, 27... 28!

408
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:05,203
Fucking Prague!

409
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:07,205
If Dukhovich is acquitted,

410
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:09,165
he'll be back in power next week.

411
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:10,583
I won't let that happen.

412
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:11,667
Good.

413
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:13,363
You should take him to The Hague.

414
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:14,545
I can't!

415
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:16,130
There's a mole inside Interpol.

416
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:18,383
- It's already cost me 12 good officers.
- Good?

417
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,428
That's subjective.
Nice. Maybe they were nice.

418
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:26,558
I'll make it simple for you;
If I stay near him, they'll find him.

419
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:29,310
So I gotta risk my life
protecting this coffin magnet over here?

420
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:30,746
No, no, no. You gotta put something

421
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,250
- in the pot.
- How about your career?

422
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:33,898
- How about it?
- Your precious career.

423
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,400
You do this job for me,

424
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:38,653
and I'll get you back to elite status.

425
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:40,976
Yeah, you don't have that power.

426
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:42,740
I've got connections.

427
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:45,702
You want back in? I can put you there.

428
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:46,828
Why would I trust you?

429
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:50,038
Why?

430
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,502
Because I've never lied to you, Michael.

431
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:59,173
You're terrible at almost everything,

432
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,677
but you're good at keeping people alive.

433
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:05,513
Keep him alive... please,

434
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:08,808
and you get your dream life back.

435
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:12,478
And as bonus,
you'll never hear from me again.

436
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:17,357
Good.

437
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:23,697
Still.

438
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:35,126
<i>Where are you?</i>

439
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:37,712
Setting up operation
at Coventry police headquarters.

440
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:39,172
You got nothing from Dukhovich?

441
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:40,340
Are you surprised?

442
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:41,257
- Ma'am?
- Busy.

443
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:43,277
I've picked up activity
at our safe house in town.

444
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:44,981
Is this something
I need to know right now?

445
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:46,971
No, not normally.
But, yes, it should be vacant.

446
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:48,264
<i>And you believe it's not?</i>

447
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:50,183
<i>Well, the access code
was activated</i>

448
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:51,809
<i>without identity authorization.</i>

449
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:53,394
Could Kincaid have gotten inside?

450
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:55,021
But it's on a revolving encryption.

451
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:58,399
Get a team over there. Now!

452
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,194
And where is Agent Roussel?

453
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:02,987
<i>Sorry, got to go.</i>

454
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:04,071
Good luck.

455
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:13,456
I believe I know where Kincaid is.

456
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,861
What the fuck is all this?

457
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:45,112
You're a fugitive.

458
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,572
Fugitives wear restraints.

459
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:48,116
No, no, no, not the cuffs.

460
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:51,035
I'm talking about these whack-ass,
hipster clothes I'm wearing.

461
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:52,485
Yeah, luckily I brought extra.

462
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:54,080
Lucky for who?

463
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:57,333
Shit. Am I wearing underwear?

464
00:31:57,542 --> 00:32:00,062
Those are for me too,
in case I have to change your pants again.

465
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:01,379
Not a fan.

466
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:03,631
You know they call them
swinging dicks for a reason.

467
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,650
How about we never speak of this again?

468
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:13,266
Shit. Interpol protocol.

469
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:17,131
When that phone rings and nobody answers,
they're gonna send officers to the door.

470
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:19,731
And there they are.

471
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:23,386
Yes, we're setting our perimeter.

472
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:26,528
Comfy?

473
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,406
So, what happened
to little Miss Interpol?

474
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:30,074
Agent Roussel's gone.

475
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:33,536
Damn! I liked her. She's spunky.

476
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,431
This building has two stairwells,

477
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:36,724
- no fire escapes...
- No fire escapes

478
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:38,166
and no adjacent rooftops.

479
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:40,644
You know, you're not the only
observant motherfucker on the planet.

480
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:41,836
I go through doors first.

481
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,796
I check to see if it's clear,
then you follow.

482
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,673
Really? You think that's necessary?

483
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:49,927
- My job is to keep you out of harm's way.
- Shit, motherfucker.

484
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:52,764
I am harm's way.

485
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:08,905
Two hostiles, maybe more.

486
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,740
I don't suppose I could have a gun?

487
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:12,992
No. We're gonna take
the north stairwell. Let's go.

488
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:15,285
Fuck!

489
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:23,294
- It's him!
- Come on!

490
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:32,803
Thank God you're here.

491
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,770
I don't know
what I would've done without you.

492
00:33:34,889 --> 00:33:36,349
Well done. Guess what happens now?

493
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,851
Shots fired! Shots fired!

494
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:55,535
<i>All units sending in nine-nine.</i>

495
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:01,082
Now we have a new problem.

496
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,544
I like to keep things
a little more subtle.

497
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:16,973
See? Boring is better.

498
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:23,396
Okay. That's very loud.

499
00:34:24,522 --> 00:34:25,565
It was empty anyway.

500
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:32,363
<i>We're identifying
heat signatures on the rooftop</i>

501
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:33,781
<i>moving in a northbound direction.</i>

502
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:35,867
Copy that! Go, go, go!
They're on the roof!

503
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:40,246
No, no, no. No odds in that jump.

504
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:42,558
It beats the hell out of whatever's
gonna come through that door.

505
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:44,542
No. Just gotta...

506
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,753
We just gotta find
a more intelligent way...

507
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,676
Motherfucker! Ahh! Shit!

508
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:57,096
Holy fucking shit.

509
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,266
Secure the roof! Go, go, go!
Delta squad with me!

510
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:02,560
- They're on the north side!
- Copy that!

511
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:12,028
Made that jump on one leg.

512
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,697
I made that jump
without jumping. Let's go.

513
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:16,361
So, what's your next trick,

514
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,534
showing me how we escape without escaping?

515
00:35:18,618 --> 00:35:21,258
Let's just try to get to the car
without killing anyone, all right?

516
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:24,624
- Is this your car?
- One of them.

517
00:35:24,707 --> 00:35:26,334
I remember
shooting at you in a Jaguar.

518
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:28,294
Buckle up. If we get
in a high-speed chase,

519
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:29,295
I want you strapped in.

520
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:31,547
I'm more worried
about the wheels coming off this bitch

521
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:33,633
when you reach the speed limit.

522
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:35,801
Back in the day,

523
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:37,845
we wouldn't have even stolen
this piece of shit,

524
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:39,889
and we stole everything.
I remember one night...

525
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:42,558
I know all I need to know about you.
All your early arrests,

526
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:45,662
your father in and out of prison,
you following in the same footsteps.

527
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,939
Did your little research, did you?

528
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:50,316
Prepare for a test,
there are no surprises.

529
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:53,277
And you grew up wanting to be a cop

530
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:55,363
till you found out
wasn't no money in that shit.

531
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:58,074
So you joined the CIA,
sharpened your skills,

532
00:35:58,157 --> 00:35:59,867
then decided to open your own shop,

533
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:01,911
pimp yourself out to the fat cats.

534
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:04,789
I didn't even have to do
no research to know that shit.

535
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:06,896
It's written all over your punk-ass.

536
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:10,544
Can't wait to hear what I'll do next.
That's great.

537
00:36:11,754 --> 00:36:12,754
You know, why don't...

538
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,318
Why don't you lay back
and keep from getting spotted.

539
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:17,176
Get comfortable.

540
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,553
That's a good idea.

541
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:25,309
Smells like ass back here!

542
00:36:26,477 --> 00:36:28,604
Bet that Jag never smelled like ass.

543
00:36:30,314 --> 00:36:31,482
These your electrolytes?

544
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:02,805
Facial recognition
identifies this man

545
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,390
as Michael Bryce.

546
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,226
But you already know that,
don't you, Agent Roussel?

547
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:09,353
You two have a history.

548
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:11,439
Long time ago.

549
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,733
You slipped Kincaid
into our own safe house,

550
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:14,984
then brought in this...

551
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,695
Executive protection agent?

552
00:37:21,866 --> 00:37:24,660
Official channels had been compromised.
What did you expect me to do?

553
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:27,163
Clearly, our office security's
been breached.

554
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:30,624
The red notice stays.
You, however, can go.

555
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,251
I'm placing you on leave.

556
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:34,837
You will surrender
your weapon and credentials.

557
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:36,922
You are going to be telling

558
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:38,758
this story for years, Amelia,

559
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:41,135
from inside a very large office

560
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:43,387
or a very small cell.

561
00:37:43,721 --> 00:37:46,682
Well, I like my odds.

562
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,340
The only way Bryce and Kincaid
don't make it to The Hague

563
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:52,298
is if they kill each other first.

564
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,190
Amelia.

565
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:57,943
She's making a mistake.

566
00:37:58,444 --> 00:37:59,987
We need to plug our leak.

567
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:03,115
Now, this Bryce, do you trust him?

568
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,326
With something like this, yes.

569
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:07,870
I'll speak to Casoria,

570
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:10,456
get her to allow you to come
to The Hague with us.

571
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:12,583
But no more secrets.

572
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:15,002
Thank you, sir.

573
00:38:25,513 --> 00:38:27,848
Search for car, plate FJ56MHV.

574
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:30,851
They'll have identified the car
with the traffic cams by now.

575
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:33,354
And you. Welcome to fugitive life.

576
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:34,939
Until I turn you in.

577
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:37,233
Just need to find a different vehicle,

578
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:40,569
older model, no alarm. Right here.

579
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:44,156
Luckily, I came prepared.

580
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:49,867
You know, if you're gonna be a while,
I can just go in there and get a room.

581
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:51,539
There's an art to low-impact,

582
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:54,917
high-efficiency
breaking and entering, but...

583
00:38:58,963 --> 00:38:59,964
Art's subjective.

584
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,130
And you're bleeding again.

585
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:04,528
You know, for a dude
that runs around killing people,

586
00:39:04,552 --> 00:39:06,595
you've got this really strange
thing about bleeding.

587
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:09,849
It's inefficient.
And I don't kill people, I protect them.

588
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:11,225
Hector Ramirez.

589
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:14,979
Hector Ramirez was an assassin.

590
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:16,397
Yeah, I know. I trained him.

591
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,399
Who was holding a knife
to my client's throat.

592
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:19,567
And you killed him.

593
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:22,069
No. I saved my client.

594
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:24,548
I think Hector might have
a different perspective on that.

595
00:39:24,572 --> 00:39:26,490
Oh, is that so? Well, here's the thing.

596
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:28,659
I was a Triple-A rated
executive protection agent.

597
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:31,162
- You just made up that Triple-A shit.
- No, I did not!

598
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:33,122
And if guys like you...
If sociopaths like you

599
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:36,017
weren't running around trying to kill
my clients, then no one would get hurt.

600
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,520
Triple-A, yeah. It sounds like you ought
to be selling life insurance

601
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:39,980
or fixing my fucking transmission,
or something.

602
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:41,314
Well,
you're uninsurable, trust me.

603
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:42,506
And you said "was."

604
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:45,402
- "I was a Triple-A, X-rated dickhead!"
- No, I said "am." Get in the fucking car!

605
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:46,886
Get in the fucking car!

606
00:39:50,598 --> 00:39:52,475
Jesus fucking Christ.

607
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,394
You definitely said "was."

608
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,229
"Was" as in,

609
00:39:57,605 --> 00:40:00,566
"I used to be a Triple-X
dickhead driving a Jag,

610
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:02,568
but now I'm rolling around
in this shit-wagon."

611
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:03,944
Put your seatbelt on.

612
00:40:04,028 --> 00:40:06,614
What happened? Lose your edge?

613
00:40:07,031 --> 00:40:11,076
Drop focus? You slip up
and let a client get popped?

614
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,203
Never slipped up.

615
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:15,539
Well, how did "am" become "was"?

616
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:20,753
I don't actually know. I mean,
how does a so-called expert assassin

617
00:40:21,045 --> 00:40:23,214
get busted by Interpol?

618
00:40:23,506 --> 00:40:25,341
Love, baby. Straight-up love.

619
00:40:26,926 --> 00:40:29,512
<i>See, I'm doing
this job in Geneva, right?</i>

620
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,514
<i>Some dude washing the wrong dude's money.</i>

621
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:32,597
<i>I get a call.</i>

622
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:33,933
What?

623
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:35,434
<i>My wife's been in a car accident,</i>

624
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:36,519
<i>- Bad one.</i>
- What?

625
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:39,772
<i>So, Geneva dude gets a pass,
I jet back to Mexico City,</i>

626
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:42,608
<i>go straight to the hospital.
Bopped up in Sonia's room,</i>

627
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:44,902
<i>two dozen agents waiting for me.</i>

628
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:52,033
Played by the heart.

629
00:40:52,785 --> 00:40:54,370
Happens to the best of us, man.

630
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:57,498
I mean, sort of like how
Agent Roussel took you from here

631
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,251
to here... to here.

632
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:03,629
Assassin and eavesdropper.
You're a real double threat.

633
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:07,150
Well, you were whining like a bitch
so loud, I heard you through the wall.

634
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:09,093
Agent Roussel and I
aren't any of your concern.

635
00:41:09,176 --> 00:41:11,679
So, she dumped you because
of all your tight-assed,

636
00:41:12,263 --> 00:41:14,390
"Boring is good, look before you leap,

637
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:15,492
put your seatbelt on" shit?

638
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:16,433
She didn't dump me.

639
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:19,353
Oh, motherfucker, I know she dumped you.

640
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:21,522
I'm just perusing all the reasons why,

641
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:23,732
and there's a plethora
of those motherfuckers.

642
00:41:24,692 --> 00:41:26,318
- Plethora?
- Yeah. It means a lot.

643
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:29,071
I know what plethora means!
It just doesn't apply here!

644
00:41:30,364 --> 00:41:33,492
And not jumping off the top of a roof,
that's logical, that's safe.

645
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:36,453
You know, wearing a seatbelt:
logical, safe.

646
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:39,814
Let me ask you something,
how many times have you been shot?

647
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:41,584
- Counting today?
- Yeah.

648
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:44,253
- Too many to count. You?
- Yeah, I bet.

649
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:45,336
Zero.

650
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:47,131
Now, we both know that's bullshit.

651
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:50,467
That's not bullshit, okay?
This was a little flesh wound.

652
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:52,070
You just kind of zinged it right there.

653
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:53,822
<i>Didn't even require a Band-Aid.
You got lucky.</i>

654
00:41:53,846 --> 00:41:56,807
<i>Yeah, the rock shifted
just as I took the shot.</i>

655
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:59,101
<i>- You lucky motherfucker.</i>
- Fuck!

656
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:00,184
Fuck!

657
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:01,686
Fucking Prague.

658
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:03,647
Yeah, Prague.

659
00:42:03,731 --> 00:42:05,211
You never even took one for a client?

660
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:06,734
Nope. Never had to.

661
00:42:06,817 --> 00:42:08,402
Yeah, but the question is, would you?

662
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:10,154
See, if I'm paying Triple-A rates,

663
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:12,865
then I'm looking
for that full-service shit,

664
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:13,948
you know what I'm saying?

665
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:16,035
That extra "A" stands for "ass,"

666
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,537
yours, between mine and a bullet.

667
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:20,456
Being prepared for everything

668
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:22,309
means that that situation statistically
just won't occur.

669
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,418
Bryce, you cannot be
prepared for everything!

670
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:26,420
Life is gonna bloody us up, okay?

671
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:29,465
You just gotta put a Band-Aid
on that shit and keep rolling!

672
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:31,884
That's really beautiful, man.

673
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:35,387
Do you ever just write stuff down?
I don't know, throw down a haiku or two?

674
00:42:36,347 --> 00:42:41,935
<i>♪ Life is a highway

675
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:45,939

685

686

688
00:43:40,536 --> 00:43:42,121
How'd you like that, motherfucker?

689
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:51,714
Do you have any idea how stupid you sound?

690
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:53,465
I mean, what a fuck-up!

691
00:43:53,966 --> 00:43:56,260
You lost my husband, and you're like,

692
00:43:56,593 --> 00:43:58,929
"Can you please help us find him?"

693
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:00,764
Why the fuck should I?

694
00:44:00,848 --> 00:44:03,517
That is your fucking job, motherfucker!

695
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:05,644
But, obviously, you suck at it.

696
00:44:09,398 --> 00:44:12,443
You received
a phone call today from your attorney.

697
00:44:12,526 --> 00:44:13,526
So?

698
00:44:14,153 --> 00:44:16,155
Well, we asked your attorney,

699
00:44:16,238 --> 00:44:19,074
but... he said he didn't have
any contact with you.

700
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:23,078
What? Are you fucking kidding me?

701
00:44:23,162 --> 00:44:25,956
Okay, that's it!
I've had it with this lawyer!

702
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:29,460
He's an alcoholic.
He calls me completely drunk,

703
00:44:29,543 --> 00:44:32,254
and he starts saying
the most inappropriate things.

704
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:36,133
Like, for example,
what he likes to do to his wife's ass.

705
00:44:36,592 --> 00:44:40,304
That is a disgusting place
to hide a child's toy!

706
00:44:40,387 --> 00:44:41,388
And you know what?

707
00:44:41,472 --> 00:44:43,474
I don't need to listen to this shit!

708
00:44:43,557 --> 00:44:45,184
Then he forgets about it,

709
00:44:45,267 --> 00:44:47,352
but I'm stuck with the images in my head!

710
00:44:47,436 --> 00:44:48,436
Mrs. Kincaid,

711
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:51,398
if you know where your husband is,

712
00:44:51,482 --> 00:44:52,483
you need to tell us.

713
00:44:53,192 --> 00:44:54,318
It's for his own safety.

714
00:45:08,165 --> 00:45:12,836
I'm sorr... You're worried
about my husband's safety?

715
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:18,008
No one in this world
can kill Darius Kincaid.

716
00:45:19,176 --> 00:45:21,386
The man is a <i>cucaracha,</i>

717
00:45:22,221 --> 00:45:24,389
and I mean that
in every sense of the word.

718
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:29,770
Sometimes you just want to crush
his little, filthy head with your shoe,

719
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:31,980
but he won't die.

720
00:45:32,272 --> 00:45:33,941
That motherfucker is unkillable,

721
00:45:34,149 --> 00:45:35,192
so you can relax.

722
00:45:37,945 --> 00:45:38,945
But wait, no.

723
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:42,241
There is one important thing
that you should know.

724
00:45:50,457 --> 00:45:52,209
Motherfuckers, get out of my fucking cell.

725
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:55,546
Great.

726
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:57,129
Now!

727
00:45:57,256 --> 00:45:59,132
And I want that lawyer fired!

728
00:45:59,216 --> 00:46:02,511
I want that lawyer fired!
I want a good one, professional lawyer!

729
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:04,471
I have rights! Human rights!

730
00:46:12,145 --> 00:46:13,981
Okay, you can take a five-minute break.

731
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:32,081
Good evening.

732
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:34,543
Can I help you?

733
00:46:34,626 --> 00:46:36,086
We need to see your cameras.

734
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:39,214
Sorry, sir, that's for management only.

735
00:46:55,063 --> 00:46:56,063
I got you!

736
00:47:01,153 --> 00:47:02,153
Where we at?

737
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,031
I backtracked west.

738
00:47:05,115 --> 00:47:06,283
West is the wrong direction.

739
00:47:06,575 --> 00:47:08,452
Thank you. Thank you.

740
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:10,794
They'd be expecting us
to take a direct route.

741
00:47:10,913 --> 00:47:12,140
The fuck is that you're eating?

742
00:47:12,164 --> 00:47:13,164
Postpones fatigue.

743
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:16,060
Refuels glycogen and electrolytes.
I got you one, too,

744
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:18,170
while you were taking
one of your world-class naps.

745
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:19,963
I'd stay awake if you let me drive.

746
00:47:20,297 --> 00:47:22,017
Thank you. That's really generous of... No!

747
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:25,676
I gotta piss.

748
00:47:26,053 --> 00:47:26,887
Use that.

749
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:28,597
Timeline's not built for another break.

750
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:33,435
Your dick might fit
in here, but mine...

751
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:37,814
Plus, I need every drop of this shit
to tolerate this ride with you.

752
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:39,763
Just pull the fucking car over.

753
00:47:40,442 --> 00:47:41,610
Jesus Christ.

754
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:52,829
It'd be a lot easier without these cuffs,

755
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:54,498
or this fucking underwear.

756
00:48:15,644 --> 00:48:16,644
Kincaid!

757
00:48:18,981 --> 00:48:20,816
Hey, asshole!

758
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:23,860
Ugh! Fucking God damn it, that's not mud!

759
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:32,359
You think I'm a fucking idiot?

760
00:48:32,953 --> 00:48:33,953
Well...

761
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:37,374
You did think that cheap whiskey was piss.

762
00:48:37,457 --> 00:48:38,709
Fuck!

763
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:41,528
Where the hell did that come from?

764
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:45,257
This is what happens
when you mess with a perfectly laid plan.

765
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:48,552
- Give me a gun. Give me a goddamn gun!
- I got this! I got this!

766
00:48:52,389 --> 00:48:53,265
There's more than one.

767
00:48:53,348 --> 00:48:55,183
A-ha! Perfect deduction, Sherlock.

768
00:48:57,686 --> 00:48:59,438
Draw their fire so I can take a look.

769
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:00,730
All right. Go!

770
00:49:03,817 --> 00:49:04,817
Ow!

771
00:49:05,277 --> 00:49:06,570
- Shit!
- Okay.

772
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:09,740
Three shooters in a row, all lit up.

773
00:49:10,866 --> 00:49:12,159
So, what do you want to do?

774
00:49:15,454 --> 00:49:17,873
While you can't come up with a plan,
they're gonna kill us.

775
00:49:18,206 --> 00:49:19,958
So here's the plan.

776
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:23,086
- What the fuck?
- You take eleven o'clock, I'll take one.

777
00:49:23,462 --> 00:49:24,921
Let's see who gets to twelve first.

778
00:49:25,464 --> 00:49:27,799
Okay. On three. You ready?

779
00:49:28,508 --> 00:49:29,508
One...

780
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,686
I said on three. You shot early.

781
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:40,937
Yeah, before they did.

782
00:49:41,146 --> 00:49:42,146
Let me break it down...

783
00:49:54,451 --> 00:49:57,537
So much for your intricately
calculated travel plans.

784
00:49:57,996 --> 00:49:59,796
That's why I was trying
to bounce on your ass.

785
00:49:59,873 --> 00:50:01,083
See, I'm safer on my own.

786
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:02,918
There's no way that they could've known

787
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:05,253
- where we were.
- Well, they did, and now they're dead.

788
00:50:09,883 --> 00:50:11,323
This yours? Is this your cell phone?

789
00:50:11,802 --> 00:50:13,595
I might've taken that off some dead merc.

790
00:50:13,929 --> 00:50:14,929
You might've...

791
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:16,950
You know, they can track a cell phone.

792
00:50:17,516 --> 00:50:21,478
That's why I use a ghost chip in mine,
so they can't track the phone.

793
00:50:21,812 --> 00:50:23,730
I mean, that's how they know
where we were!

794
00:50:24,564 --> 00:50:26,650
Here I am, I'm plotting courses
all over the country,

795
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:29,694
and you're carrying a location beacon
in your pocket!

796
00:50:30,654 --> 00:50:31,654
My bad.

797
00:50:31,863 --> 00:50:32,863
Your bad?

798
00:50:33,448 --> 00:50:36,493
You don't even understand how
21st century technology works! I mean,

799
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:38,829
how have you stayed alive this long?

800
00:50:38,912 --> 00:50:43,875
While all you guys are wasting your time
planning and aiming and deducing,

801
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:45,168
I just do my thing,

802
00:50:45,502 --> 00:50:48,755
and my thing has always been better
than your fucking thing.

803
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:50,841
Great. There you go.

804
00:50:52,092 --> 00:50:52,926
That's just great.

805
00:50:53,009 --> 00:50:55,428
I'm glad that your thing has
always been better than mine.

806
00:50:57,389 --> 00:50:58,574
You're not gonna take this gun?

807
00:50:58,598 --> 00:51:00,517
No, you keep that gun.
Use it to shoot me.

808
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,400
No, no, no, I was gonna
shoot you with this...

809
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:04,478
Shit!

810
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:15,239
There go the guns.

811
00:51:15,824 --> 00:51:17,075
Well, look on the bright side.

812
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:19,411
We get the bad guys' van.

813
00:51:40,807 --> 00:51:42,392
This field smells like your car.

814
00:51:44,436 --> 00:51:46,771
Dude, I said I was sorry about the phone.

815
00:51:47,564 --> 00:51:49,244
Who knows, maybe
your plan would've worked.

816
00:51:51,234 --> 00:51:53,087
- So, what about your other plan?
- There's no plan!

817
00:51:53,111 --> 00:51:55,864
The plan is we're in a cow pasture,
that's the plan.

818
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:58,408
I'm talking about your Agent Roussel plan.

819
00:51:58,867 --> 00:52:00,952
That's why you're doing this, right?
Get her back?

820
00:52:03,038 --> 00:52:06,041
You think becoming
a Triple-A card-carrying dickhead

821
00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:09,961
is gonna give you an all-access
backstage pass to Agent Roussel's ass,

822
00:52:10,295 --> 00:52:12,005
- and she'll fall in love.
- I get it.

823
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:14,317
- You're gonna be the guy...
- And your life will have meaning again.

824
00:52:14,341 --> 00:52:16,444
...that the other inmates come to
for advice. They're very lucky.

825
00:52:16,468 --> 00:52:18,678
Motherfucker, please.

826
00:52:19,346 --> 00:52:22,140
I've eaten hamburgers
that know more about women than you.

827
00:52:22,557 --> 00:52:25,852
- You, my friend, are a romantic retard.
- Hey!

828
00:52:26,645 --> 00:52:28,188
Just 'cause I want to get my business

829
00:52:28,271 --> 00:52:30,311
back in order, that doesn't make me
a shitty person.

830
00:52:30,732 --> 00:52:34,569
And Amelia has nothing,
absolutely nothing, to do with this.

831
00:52:35,862 --> 00:52:39,616
Oh man. You are so in love, it is crazy.

832
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:41,243
Christ, do you ever shut up?

833
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:44,746
Why is everything always
about love with you?

834
00:52:45,247 --> 00:52:46,623
Well, what else is there?

835
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:52,295
I mean, take away the guns, the money,
the travel, the perfect shot

836
00:52:52,379 --> 00:52:55,173
through a motherfucker's
earhole from 300 meters.

837
00:52:56,341 --> 00:52:59,177
I mean, none of that shit means dick
if I can't tell Sonia about it.

838
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:02,180
Well, I guess Amelia's
just not as special as Sonia.

839
00:53:02,264 --> 00:53:03,515
She sounds great.

840
00:53:04,266 --> 00:53:05,809
- What, she cheat on you?
- No.

841
00:53:06,184 --> 00:53:07,894
- Try to kill you?
- No.

842
00:53:07,978 --> 00:53:10,855
'Cause Sonia chopped off part of my ear
with a machete one time.

843
00:53:10,939 --> 00:53:12,816
She sewed it back on, but...

844
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:16,278
it was two, three days before
our shit got real again.

845
00:53:17,362 --> 00:53:18,922
Where'd you guys meet, ChristianMingle?

846
00:53:18,947 --> 00:53:20,490
No. A bar in Honduras.

847
00:53:21,283 --> 00:53:24,703
One of those places

00:55:18,525 --> 00:55:19,525
Need a ride?

872
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:21,945
Yeah. We're trying to catch
a ferry to Amsterdam.

873
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:23,672
- Yeah, I can get you there.
- Yeah?

874
00:55:23,696 --> 00:55:24,531
Jump in.

875
00:55:24,614 --> 00:55:27,409
Hey, hey, hey, there's eyes
all over Amsterdam for me.

876
00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:28,594
That's where Sonia's locked up.

877
00:55:28,618 --> 00:55:30,578
It's a quick in and out.
I got a place there.

878
00:55:30,662 --> 00:55:32,205
- You got a place in Amsterdam?
- Yeah.

879
00:55:32,705 --> 00:55:33,945
Is that where you keep the Jag?

880
00:55:34,624 --> 00:55:36,384
You know what?
Why don't you go fuck yourself

881
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:38,336
and the horse you... Hello.

882
00:55:41,673 --> 00:55:43,049
Hello, beautiful Sisters.

883
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:49,139
Whose lap will I sit on?

884
00:57:13,723 --> 00:57:14,723
One more!

885
00:57:24,943 --> 00:57:25,985
Your stop, boys!

886
00:57:28,488 --> 00:57:30,907
You take care, sisters.

887
00:57:31,658 --> 00:57:32,825
Bye, Kincaid!

888
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:37,163
Go with God!

889
00:57:37,664 --> 00:57:39,958
This man's killed over 150 people.

890
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:41,292
Two-fifty, easy.

891
00:57:42,168 --> 00:57:43,169
Yeah, but they love you.

892
00:57:43,962 --> 00:57:45,713
Me, they want to perform an exorcism on.

893
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:47,834
Question for a higher power.

894
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:50,176
Who is more wicked,

895
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:52,804
he who kills evil motherfuckers

896
00:57:53,555 --> 00:57:54,764
or he who protects them?

897
00:58:07,694 --> 00:58:09,254
You really believe you're the good guy?

898
00:58:16,786 --> 00:58:19,247
My first contract... I was...

899
00:58:20,415 --> 00:58:21,833
I don't know, 16, 17.

900
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:26,379
<i>There was a guy who broke into a church.</i>

901
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:30,425
<i>The preacher was still there,
so he told the guy,</i>

902
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:33,303
<i>"Look, you don't have to steal anything.
Take whatever you want."</i>

903
00:58:34,762 --> 00:58:36,002
<i>Dude wasn't there for the loot.</i>

904
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:37,599
<i>He wanted to hurt somebody.</i>

905
00:58:44,105 --> 00:58:44,939
<i>Slaughters the preacher,</i>

906
00:58:45,023 --> 00:58:48,568
<i>displays his body on the altar
for his congregation to see.</i>

907
00:58:59,787 --> 00:59:03,207
<i>The Bible says never to take revenge,</i>

908
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:06,794
<i>to leave it to the Lord.</i>

909
00:59:10,465 --> 00:59:12,258
<i>But I wasn't prepared to wait that long.</i>

910
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:32,612
So, when your moral compass
gets around to pointing at me,

911
00:59:33,613 --> 00:59:36,699
yeah, you'll be pointing
at one of the good guys.

912
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:40,082
And how does one
of the good guys get connected

913
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:41,559
with a piece of shit like Dukhovich?

914
00:59:42,455 --> 00:59:44,135
I didn't know everything
the dude was into.

915
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:45,290
That's an easy excuse.

916
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:47,561
Look, you know everything
about every client you ever had?

917
00:59:47,585 --> 00:59:50,672
Nope. I don't decide
whether my clients live or die.

When's the last time you paid rent
on this safe house?

925
01:00:31,421 --> 01:00:34,132
I haven't done a lot
of Amsterdam jobs lately.

926

I just need to get my gear.

927
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:40,054
The problem is that...
all the windows are polycarb.

928
01:00:40,138 --> 01:00:42,765
They have... extra layers of laminate,

929
01:00:43,766 --> 01:00:45,452
and obviously there's
a Hetzger alarm system,

01:01:44,285 --> 01:01:46,204
How can you allow Kincaid's testimony?

951
01:01:46,871 --> 01:01:49,415
A hired killer given a sweetheart deal.

952
01:01:50,166 --> 01:01:52,752
A man like that will say
anything to save himself.

953
01:01:52,835 --> 01:01:54,462
Kincaid has no sweetheart deal.

954
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:56,714
His wife will go free, not him.

955
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:03,805
The testimony will be allowed,

956
01:02:04,305 --> 01:02:06,891
assuming you produce
your witness by 5:00 p.m.

957
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:16,418
- Michael, you should've been here by now.
- Yeah. Just a couple of bumps.

958
01:02:16,442 --> 01:02:17,276
We're on our way.

959
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,921
<i>The judge isn't giving us any wiggle room.</i>

960
01:02:18,945 --> 01:02:20,613
You have less than four hours now!

961
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,880
<i>Well, we're gonna be there in half that.</i>

962
01:02:23,825 --> 01:02:24,945
Then why are you calling me?

963
01:02:27,203 --> 01:02:28,287
Right. Well...

964
01:02:31,082 --> 01:02:33,459
I'm calling you because
I've been thinking, and...

965
01:02:37,922 --> 01:02:38,922
I forgive you.

966
01:02:42,635 --> 01:02:43,635
Yeah.

967
01:02:44,887 --> 01:02:45,972
It feels good to say that.

968
01:02:49,392 --> 01:02:50,393
I forgive you, Amelia.

969
01:02:52,144 --> 01:02:53,771
Are you fucking kidding me?

970
01:02:54,146 --> 01:02:55,146
What?

971
01:02:55,356 --> 01:02:56,858
You're seriously doing this now?

972
01:02:57,108 --> 01:02:59,026
- No. What?
<i>- And forgive me for what?</i>

973
01:02:59,652 --> 01:03:02,297
- There's nothing to forgive!
- No, no, no, look, I thought that you...

974
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:05,157
- Just get Kincaid here!
- Fucking prick!

975
01:03:16,711 --> 01:03:17,711
Darius?

976
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:29,472
Fuck!

977
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:36,022
Yeah. We've got the whole area covered.

978
01:03:36,564 --> 01:03:38,357
If Kincaid shows up, he's ours.

Couldn't you just had
the flowers delivered?

1001
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:15,473
Needed a personal touch.

1002
01:06:15,681 --> 01:06:17,242
You were about to get
his personal touch,

1003
01:06:17,266 --> 01:06:18,184
if I hadn't followed you.

1004
01:06:18,267 --> 01:06:19,185
All right, I appreciate you.

1005
01:06:19,268 --> 01:06:21,288
And the guys who started
tracking you a few blocks ago.

1006
01:06:21,312 --> 01:06:23,064
You mean the guy you snatched in the bush,

1007
01:06:23,147 --> 01:06:24,907
and the two you left
knocked out in the park?

1008
01:06:25,399 --> 01:06:27,318
Like I said, I appreciate you.

1009
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:29,987
Okay, so if you knew
that they were out there,

1010
01:06:30,071 --> 01:06:32,656
but you still felt it was important
to deliver these flowers?

1011
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,035
Sonia's gonna really love those flowers.

1012
01:06:36,118 --> 01:06:37,787
I sure fucking hope so.

1013
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:40,247
Now, this is as close
as I'm gonna be to her

1014
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:41,707
for a very long time.

1015
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,418
It had to be special.

1016
01:06:46,837 --> 01:06:47,837
First.

1017
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:51,634
I'm first. Look... You were saying?

1018
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:53,510
Tell me something.

1019
01:06:53,594 --> 01:06:55,221
The day you and Agent Roussel

1020
01:06:55,304 --> 01:06:56,972
took that picture I saw in your place,

1021
01:06:57,348 --> 01:06:59,948
what kind of things would you have done
for her to make her happy?

1022
01:07:00,893 --> 01:07:03,312
Anything. I loved her. Trusted her.

1023
01:07:04,313 --> 01:07:06,190
She sold me out. Case closed.

1024
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:10,528
Well, that's cold. Maybe, just maybe,

1025
01:07:11,237 --> 01:07:12,738
you ought to give her a pass on this.

1026
01:07:13,614 --> 01:07:15,449
I mean, I gotta tell you, honestly,

1027
01:07:16,325 --> 01:07:18,661
there's not a lot of women
who'd put up with your shit.

1028
01:07:19,662 --> 01:07:20,955
That's inspirational, thank you.

1029
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:23,624
What I meant to say:
there's no women who would put up with it.

1030
01:07:23,999 --> 01:07:25,477
- That's better.
- You're an annoying motherfucker

1031
01:07:25,501 --> 01:07:26,661
with all your rules and shit.

1032
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:29,880
I mean, if she can put up with that,
she must be a pretty special girl.

1033
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:33,591
She is.

1034
01:07:35,344 --> 01:07:37,346
You know, I told her today
that I forgave her.

1035
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,683
Really? And how'd that go?

1036
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,100
Hard to tell.

1037
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:44,603
You know, women don't like
to be forgiven for shit

1038
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,231
'cause that implies they did
some shit to begin with.

1039
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:50,776
I should just forget about Kurosawa.

1040
01:07:51,318 --> 01:07:53,237
- What?
- Takashi Kurosawa.

1041
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:57,575
He was my client, she exposed him,
and he got killed.

1042
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:03,830
Something funny?

1043
01:08:05,666 --> 01:08:08,127
She didn't expose your client!

1044
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:09,795
I popped Kurosawa!

1045
01:08:11,463 --> 01:08:13,465
<i>I was at the airport for another target.</i>

1046
01:08:13,549 --> 01:08:14,925
<i>I spotted him by accident.</i>

1047
01:08:15,134 --> 01:08:17,469
<i>Lucky for me. Him, not so much.</i>

1048
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:20,431

1051
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:36,405

I was the one who popped him.

1052
01:08:45,372 --> 01:08:46,372
I...

1053
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:51,712
- Shit! What the fuck, Bryce! Mother...
- We're done!

1054
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:53,380
That shit was two years ago, man.

1055
01:08:53,464 --> 01:08:54,944
You gonna be a little bitch about it?

1056

as a condom in a convent.

1060
01:09:04,058 --> 01:09:06,518

1061
01:09:06,602 --> 01:09:09,146

you know what he'd say?

He'd say, "I had it all

Do you know how hard that is to do?

1087
01:10:46,618 --> 01:10:49,330

01:14:14,952 --> 01:14:15,952
Fuck!

1108
01:14:17,287 --> 01:14:18,872
Hey, Interpol! Interpol!

1109
01:14:25,629 --> 01:14:26,629
Fuck!

1110
01:14:34,471 --> 01:14:35,471
Shit!

1111
01:15:05,544 --> 01:15:06,628
Hurry!

1112
01:15:39,745 --> 01:15:40,912
Fuck!

1113
01:16:23,288 --> 01:16:24,288
Fuck!

1114
01:16:53,485 --> 01:16:54,528
Okay.

1115
01:17:03,453 --> 01:17:05,705
A loose helmet
is like wearing no helmet at all.

1116
01:17:06,706 --> 01:17:09,376
It's not a button strap. It's a D-ring.

1117
01:17:09,835 --> 01:17:12,462
Just unthread it through
the thing. It's very simple.

1118
01:17:13,213 --> 01:17:16,007
Well... Or there's...
There's that shortcut.

1119
01:17:31,606 --> 01:17:34,693
I ask you one time, polite.

1120
01:17:35,402 --> 01:17:37,863
Where is Kincaid?

1121
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,159
Honestly, I'd tell you if I knew.

1122
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:45,745
You have my word. Look at my right hand.

1123
01:17:46,788 --> 01:17:48,999
See that? That's a Boy Scout salute.

1124
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:50,959
We're sworn to never lie.

1125
01:17:51,042 --> 01:17:52,669
I've taken an oath, so you can trust...

1126
01:17:53,462 --> 01:17:56,339
Right in the fucking ear!

1127
01:17:59,384 --> 01:18:00,760
Really? Waterboarding? Really?

1128
01:18:01,636 --> 01:18:03,805
I was in the CIA. You know,
we don't do that anymore.

1129
01:18:06,057 --> 01:18:08,518
Okay. Hey, hey. Hold it.
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

1130
01:18:08,768 --> 01:18:11,021
Here's what we learned.
The key to interrogation

1131
01:18:11,229 --> 01:18:12,481
is establishing a bond

1132
01:18:12,898 --> 01:18:15,317
between the interrogator
and the subject, okay?

1133
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,986
You know, just sort of
like a rapport, okay?

1134
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:21,907
You need me to like you.
You need me to like you, okay?

1135
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:23,617
You need me to like you!

1136
01:18:34,044 --> 01:18:35,295
I really don't like you.

1137
01:18:37,005 --> 01:18:38,465
Okay, okay, okay.

1138
01:18:47,474 --> 01:18:49,100
Where is Kincaid?

1139
01:18:49,601 --> 01:18:51,770
He's right behind you.
Scout's honor.

'cause I know you're gonna

cost you your girl and that...

fake-ass, made-up Triple-A shit

- No, no, no...

1157
01:20:36,374 --> 01:20:37,500
No, it was all my fault.

1158
01:20:38,877 --> 01:20:42,505
No... I did it all to myself.

1159
01:20:42,589 --> 01:20:44,799
Bryce, please! Come on,
you didn't do it to yourself.

1160
01:20:44,883 --> 01:20:46,635
That's life. Life happens.

1161
01:20:47,135 --> 01:20:48,428
Life without Amelia.

1162
01:20:50,764 --> 01:20:53,183
Hey, still time to work that shit out.

1163
01:20:55,769 --> 01:20:57,479
So, how'd you and Agent Roussel meet?

1164
01:21:01,232 --> 01:21:02,232
On a job.

1165
01:21:04,027 --> 01:21:05,027
She was...

1166
01:21:06,821 --> 01:21:08,698
She was working an undercover op,

1167
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:11,158
very badly.

1168
01:21:12,994 --> 01:21:15,580
<i>I was at a client's funeral.
Massive heart attack.</i>

1169
01:21:16,206 --> 01:21:18,166

See, that's what I'm talking about.

1191
01:22:43,793 --> 01:22:44,794
It just happened!

1192
01:22:45,462 --> 01:22:47,255
You didn't plan it, deduce it,

1193
01:22:47,338 --> 01:22:49,632
or google running
into the girl of your dreams.

01:22:51,176 --> 01:22:53,178
the same way I just bumped into Kurosawa.

1196
01:22:53,595 --> 01:22:55,180
You know, when life gives you shit,

you make Kool-Aid.

1198
01:23:00,518 --> 01:23:02,270
That's not really
how that expression works.

1199
01:23:02,353 --> 01:23:05,356
Yeah, and that's the beauty

01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,692
Ah. Yeah, well, life, I mean...

1201
01:23:07,776 --> 01:23:11,154
Life doesn't usually give you shit,
and then turn into a beverage.

1202
01:23:11,529 --> 01:23:14,282
That's not... At least
where I'm from, that's not how it works.

1203
01:23:14,365 --> 01:23:15,926
Look, motherfucker,
you don't have to explain

1204
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:18,471
- every goddamn thing that goes on in life!
- If it gives you lemons...

1205
01:23:18,495 --> 01:23:20,181
Okay? You don't need a reason
for that shit.

1206
01:23:20,205 --> 01:23:21,039
...you would make lemonade.

1207

I'd say you're right.

1227
01:24:29,566 --> 01:24:32,235
We'll just go to Amsterdam,
I'll help you get Sonia out,

1228
01:24:33,653 --> 01:24:35,293
and you give her those flowers in person.

Dukhovich, that motherfucker's gotta go.

1233
01:24:46,124 --> 01:24:48,004
Well, it's not gonna happen
unless we get there.

1234
01:24:48,418 --> 01:24:49,418
Shit, I'd bet on them.

1235
01:24:49,878 --> 01:24:50,962

There's a couple of ringers in the game.

That's a good-looking Jag.

1240
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:04,434
Yeah. I guarantee
you if that smells like ass,

1241
01:25:04,517 --> 01:25:05,852
it's supermodel ass.

1242
01:25:12,191 --> 01:25:14,110
- Really?
- Oh yeah.

1243
01:25:14,569 --> 01:25:15,569
She blends right in.

1244
01:25:36,132 --> 01:25:37,383

on the right-hand side here,

1248

It's practically impossible...

1249
01:25:48,311 --> 01:25:49,771
Get out of the fucking car.

1250
01:25:49,854 --> 01:25:51,665
A three-day adjustment period
to figure this out.

1252

1253
01:25:55,568 --> 01:25:56,694
Have you ever said please

1254
01:25:56,778 --> 01:25:57,838
- or thank you...
- Please, motherfucker!

1255
01:25:57,862 --> 01:25:59,155
Why are we always yelling?

1256
01:25:59,238 --> 01:26:00,678
- Get out of the fucking car!
- Fine!

1257
01:26:04,911 --> 01:26:06,162
Time's just about up.

1258
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:11,125
No sign. They vanished in Amsterdam.

1259
01:26:11,209 --> 01:26:12,418
Dukhovich is free.

01:26:28,977 --> 01:26:30,061
Hello?

1263
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:31,187
<i>Hey.</i>

1264
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:32,188
Michael, where are you?

1265
01:26:32,271 --> 01:26:33,564
We're a couple minutes out.

1266
01:26:37,068 --> 01:26:38,068
Look...

1267
01:26:38,903 --> 01:26:40,196
I wanna tell you that I'm sorry.

1268
01:26:42,407 --> 01:26:45,243
I wanna say that I'm sorry
for, um, for everything.

1269
01:26:45,326 --> 01:26:47,954
For Kurosawa, us, it's all my fault.

1270
01:26:48,037 --> 01:26:49,455
You know, I act like a...

1271
01:26:50,415 --> 01:26:52,333
I act like a fucking child around you.

1272
01:26:52,417 --> 01:26:54,812
<i>I can't admit that it's my fault,
and I project that onto you,</i>

1273
01:26:54,836 --> 01:26:56,337
<i>and, you know, that's not fair.</i>

1274
01:26:56,754 --> 01:26:57,922
You deserve better than that.

1275
01:27:02,635 --> 01:27:04,095
Why are you telling me this now?

1276
01:27:04,178 --> 01:27:07,140
Well, under the circumstances,
it seemed like a good time.

1277
01:27:07,223 --> 01:27:08,391
We got company.

1278
01:27:08,474 --> 01:27:09,475
Huh?

1279
01:27:17,608 --> 01:27:18,608
Let's go!

1280
01:27:28,077 --> 01:27:29,078
Amelia.

1281
01:27:33,875 --> 01:27:34,875
Amelia.

1282
01:27:38,379 --> 01:27:39,672
Just want to say that...

1283
01:27:39,756 --> 01:27:43,593
I... love... you.

1284
01:27:53,978 --> 01:27:56,481
Jesus Christ! Really?

1285
01:27:56,564 --> 01:27:58,024
What happened to the seatbelt rule?

1286
01:28:07,658 --> 01:28:08,658
Fuck!

1287

1301
01:28:48,366 --> 01:28:49,366
He had to bounce.

Follow me.

1361
01:35:55,834 --> 01:35:57,127
Obviously, Your Honor,

1362
01:35:57,211 --> 01:36:00,881
this has devolved into a complete waste
of my client's time.

1363
01:36:01,257 --> 01:36:03,217
The prosecution has no witness to present.

1364
01:36:06,262 --> 01:36:07,822
Can you empty
your pockets, please, sir.

1365
01:36:14,353 --> 01:36:15,938
Are you kidding me? Come on!

1366
01:36:19,858 --> 01:36:21,986
As we seem to be reaching our deadline,

1367
01:36:22,069 --> 01:36:26,657
I have no choice but to declare
that this trial has come to its natural...

1368
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,128
Your Honor, I present Darius Kincaid.

1369
01:36:39,211 --> 01:36:40,713
The deadline has passed!

1370
01:36:40,796 --> 01:36:44,133
I believe we still had
a few seconds on the clock.

1371
01:36:45,759 --> 01:36:46,759
How do I look?

1372
01:36:46,969 --> 01:36:48,762
You got a little speck of blood on your...

1373
01:36:49,972 --> 01:36:50,972
everywhere.

1374
01:36:51,932 --> 01:36:54,351
Will the prosecution
please prepare their witness.

1375
01:36:54,435 --> 01:36:56,020
- Hi.
- My God, are you okay?

1376
01:36:56,437 --> 01:36:58,939
Yeah. There's your guy.

1377
01:37:00,774 --> 01:37:02,484
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1378
01:37:04,236 --> 01:37:05,356
By the way, bumping into you

1379
01:37:05,404 --> 01:37:07,084
is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1380
01:37:13,996 --> 01:37:15,956
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

1381
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:17,124
and nothing but the truth?

1382
01:37:17,958 --> 01:37:18,958
Yeah.

1383
01:37:21,003 --> 01:37:23,172
Your name is Darius Kincaid?

1384
01:37:23,756 --> 01:37:27,134
No. My real name is Darius Evans.

1385
01:37:28,052 --> 01:37:29,678
My parents separated when I was six.

1386
01:37:30,012 --> 01:37:32,514
My mother remarried
a real mean piece of work

1387
01:37:33,015 --> 01:37:34,683
named Roger Kincaid.

1388
01:37:35,059 --> 01:37:36,727
She figured if I took his name,

1389
01:37:37,269 --> 01:37:38,771
he'd keep his belt on more often.

1390
01:37:39,146 --> 01:37:41,023
Plan didn't work so well,
but the name stuck.

1391
01:37:41,732 --> 01:37:45,110
My real father's name
is Maurice Evans, preacher.

1392
01:37:45,611 --> 01:37:47,738
He was killed a few years later
in his own church.

1393
01:37:48,656 --> 01:37:49,573
I'm sorry, I didn't...

1394
01:37:49,657 --> 01:37:51,825
That's all right.
Can't research everything.

1395
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:56,538
Mr. Kincaid, were you ever
in the employ of Vladislav Dukhovich?

1396
01:37:58,290 --> 01:38:00,376
No.
Have you ever met Dukhovich?

1397
01:38:01,168 --> 01:38:05,255
Yes. April 17, 2012,
he invited me to his palace.

1398
01:38:06,924 --> 01:38:10,177
<i>Prosecution Exhibit
17-D, palace security logs.</i>

1399
01:38:11,303 --> 01:38:13,681
<i>Did he offer you employment then?</i>

1400
01:38:14,431 --> 01:38:15,431
<i>Yes, he did.</i>

1401
01:38:16,809 --> 01:38:20,521
<i>He wanted me to take out
a political rival exiled in the UK.</i>

1402
01:38:22,856 --> 01:38:24,316
<i>- I refused.
- Why?</i>

1403
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:26,735
<i>Because while I was
there, he ordered his men</i>

1404
01:38:26,819 --> 01:38:28,946
<i>to slaughter a village outside Polotsk.</i>

1405
01:38:32,032 --> 01:38:33,784
I'm not down with killing innocent people.

1406
01:38:34,118 --> 01:38:35,994
And do you have evidence
to corroborate this?

1407
01:38:36,578 --> 01:38:37,578
Yeah.

1408
01:38:39,248 --> 01:38:42,167
Go to FTP site Raven 257.

1409
01:38:43,919 --> 01:38:44,962

01:38:51,093 --> 01:38:52,761

1414
01:38:52,845 --> 01:38:54,888
"Dukhovich is a dick," all caps,

1415
01:38:55,431 --> 01:38:57,057
except "dick" is lower case.

1416
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:01,895
I wasn't gonna trust
Interpol with this shit.

1417

Order!

1418

Order!

1419
01:39:25,461 --> 01:39:26,461
Order in the court!

1420
01:39:27,838 --> 01:39:28,838
Your Honors,

1421
01:39:30,048 --> 01:39:34,386
I could save us all some time.
May I address the court?

1422
01:39:38,056 --> 01:39:41,143
For months, I have been
sitting in this chair,

1423
01:39:41,226 --> 01:39:46,106
nodding along to this ludicrous charade.

1424
01:39:46,190 --> 01:39:47,190
Excuse me.

1425
01:39:47,566 --> 01:39:49,026
My excellent attorney was hoping

1426
01:39:49,109 --> 01:39:51,195
for the legitimacy of a formal acquittal,

1427
01:39:51,278 --> 01:39:53,280
but that is no longer possible.

1428
01:39:53,363 --> 01:39:54,490
Thank you, Darius.

1429
01:39:55,824 --> 01:39:58,660
So, let us now end the charade.

1430
01:39:59,328 --> 01:40:01,330
The charges against me

1431
01:40:02,664 --> 01:40:04,166
are entirely correct.

1432
01:40:05,876 --> 01:40:09,379
I am the rightful ruler of Belarus!

1433
01:40:10,005 --> 01:40:12,883
- Sit down! Order!
- As the ruler of my nation,

1434
01:40:12,966 --> 01:40:16,386
I will do as I wish without exception,
without apology.

1435
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:18,847
- Sit down! Order!
- I recognize no authority

1436
01:40:18,931 --> 01:40:21,091
- that limits my power!
- Mr. Dukhovich, I order you...

1437
01:40:24,228 --> 01:40:25,270
Assistant Director.

1438
01:40:25,354 --> 01:40:26,647
Go do your job, Amelia!

1439
01:40:28,565 --> 01:40:30,442
In this trial...

1440
01:40:30,526 --> 01:40:34,279
the world community
is attempting to make a statement!

1441
01:40:34,363 --> 01:40:37,658
Well, now I would like to make
a statement of my own!

1442
01:40:42,996 --> 01:40:43,997
Show me your phone.

1443
01:40:47,918 --> 01:40:51,713
I recognize no authority
that limits my powers!

1444
01:41:03,934 --> 01:41:05,477
Everybody go!

1445
01:41:11,483 --> 01:41:15,529
I will now take my leave
with my dignity intact!

1446
01:41:41,179 --> 01:41:44,641
Now, that's what
I call Triple-A service.

1447
01:41:45,601 --> 01:41:46,601
Fuck!

1448
01:41:48,103 --> 01:41:51,398
Fuck! Medic! Medic!
I need a medic over here!

1449
01:41:52,316 --> 01:41:54,109
- Lockdown protocol!
- Don't move!

1450
01:42:05,954 --> 01:42:09,499
<i>We're here live in front
of the ICC in The Hague</i>

1451
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:13,795

into a crowd of protestors.</i>

1452
01:42:14,504 --> 01:42:16,798

It's a critical health situation!</i>

1454

Focus on me, Bryce.

1455
01:42:23,764 --> 01:42:25,223
Bryce! Focus on me.

1456
01:42:25,307 --> 01:42:27,184
I'd really rather not.

1457
01:42:27,559 --> 01:42:32,397
...<i>in effect.
All units. All units.</i>

1458
01:42:33,273 --> 01:42:36,151
Stay with me, Bryce. Stay with me.

1459
01:42:36,568 --> 01:42:38,695
I did my job. You go do yours.

1460
01:42:39,488 --> 01:42:41,323
Gotta go get that motherfucker!

1461
01:42:45,494 --> 01:42:46,662
Freeze! On your knees.

1462

1464
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:04,596
Officer, the building is in lockdown.

1465
01:43:05,097 --> 01:43:06,473
Dukhovich does not leave his cell.

1466
01:43:12,604 --> 01:43:13,604
Let's go!

1467
01:43:31,623 --> 01:43:33,166
It's over, Assistant Director.

1468
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:34,668
Give up.

1469
01:44:15,625 --> 01:44:19,171
I didn't want to do this, Amelia.
I swear to you.

1470
01:44:48,617 --> 01:44:49,617
Fuck!

1471
01:44:58,168 --> 01:45:01,338
Michael! Michael!

1472
01:45:04,049 --> 01:45:06,968
- Michael, you hear me?
- Are you okay? Yeah?

1473
01:45:07,052 --> 01:45:08,845
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Good, good, good.

1474
01:45:08,929 --> 01:45:09,930
- You?
- Yeah.

1475
01:45:10,347 --> 01:45:12,516
Oh, no. You're bleeding.

1476
01:45:12,599 --> 01:45:14,976
Oh, no, no, no.

1477
01:45:19,481 --> 01:45:20,481
I'll get some help.

1478
01:45:22,317 --> 01:45:23,317
Stay here.

1479
01:45:33,954 --> 01:45:34,954
Hey!

1480
01:45:35,247 --> 01:45:36,373
Hey!

1481
01:46:07,445 --> 01:46:08,989
Up on the ledge, Dookie man.

1482
01:46:12,534 --> 01:46:15,245
You heard me, bitch! Up on the ledge!

1483
01:46:31,595 --> 01:46:33,430
The look on your face.

1484
01:46:35,724 --> 01:46:37,309
You're so proud.

1485
01:46:38,018 --> 01:46:40,020
Darius Kincaid,

1486
01:46:40,937 --> 01:46:43,648
about to be a hero, save the day.

1487
01:46:44,649 --> 01:46:46,151
None of that matters.

1488
01:46:47,152 --> 01:46:48,361
There is no redemption,

1489
01:46:48,820 --> 01:46:51,865
no atonement for a man like you.

1490
01:46:51,948 --> 01:46:56,578
Your whole life has been
but a trail of corpses,

1491
01:46:57,913 --> 01:47:01,041
and I will be just another
dead body on the pile!

1492
01:47:03,460 --> 01:47:04,460
Go ahead!

1493
01:47:06,046 --> 01:47:07,046
Finish me!

1494
01:47:09,007 --> 01:47:13,428
But don't think for a moment
it will change what you are.

1495
01:47:20,936 --> 01:47:23,021
I don't give a fuck about all of that!

1496
01:47:23,939 --> 01:47:24,939
You fucked up

1497
01:47:25,899 --> 01:47:29,110
when you shot my bodyguard.

1498
01:47:30,612 --> 01:47:31,612
Who?

1499
01:47:45,377 --> 01:47:46,461
Dukhovich.

1500
01:47:48,463 --> 01:47:49,463
That's Dukhovich.

1501
01:48:14,531 --> 01:48:16,700
Okay, here's what I'm thinking.

1502
01:48:17,701 --> 01:48:18,743
Celebrity security.

1503
01:48:19,411 --> 01:48:20,411
It's low stress.

1504
01:48:20,954 --> 01:48:22,914
Boy bands and shit, right?

1505
01:48:22,998 --> 01:48:25,638
One of those guys gets killed,
nobody's getting all that mad at me.

1506
01:48:27,168 --> 01:48:28,712
Well, we'll figure it out.

1507
01:48:28,795 --> 01:48:29,795
We will?

1508
01:48:31,256 --> 01:48:34,843
Yo! What a brother gotta do
to get arrested up in this bitch?

1509
01:48:37,387 --> 01:48:40,807
Can't someone just Taser him?
I mean, like, a non-lethal Taser.

1510
01:48:41,182 --> 01:48:44,811
Director Casoria. My deal still good?

1511
01:48:45,395 --> 01:48:47,897
You definitely held up
your end, Mr. Kincaid.

1512
01:48:48,565 --> 01:48:52,819
Agent Roussel, why don't you go find
Mr. Kincaid some handcuffs.

1513
01:48:54,029 --> 01:48:55,030
With pleasure.

1514
01:48:59,409 --> 01:49:01,661
You were right to trust your instincts.
Well done.

1515
01:49:02,746 --> 01:49:03,746
Thank you, ma'am.

1516
01:49:06,374 --> 01:49:07,917
- You're welcome.
- For what?

1517
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:10,587
I got you a front row seat
to the Roussel show,

1518
01:49:10,670 --> 01:49:13,048
and I got you that all-access
backstage pass

1519
01:49:13,131 --> 01:49:15,383
- to that ass you've been wanting so bad.
- You did what?

1520
01:49:15,759 --> 01:49:18,094
You jumped out of the car,
I gave her the 411 on you.

1521
01:49:18,178 --> 01:49:21,097
I didn't jump out of the...
I went through the fucking windshield.

1522
01:49:21,181 --> 01:49:22,015
Semantics.

1523
01:49:22,098 --> 01:49:23,016
Semantics?

1524
01:49:23,099 --> 01:49:25,453
Semantics. Yeah, just another way
of saying the same thing...

1525
01:49:25,477 --> 01:49:27,020
I know what semantics means.

1526
01:49:27,103 --> 01:49:29,081
I also know that I don't need
love advice from you.

1527
01:49:29,105 --> 01:49:31,024
Oh, really? So tell me
how that love life shit

1528
01:49:31,107 --> 01:49:32,267
was going before I showed up.

1529
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:39,280
You know, she's gonna be
right back, and that's it.

1530
01:49:40,241 --> 01:49:41,284
Last chance to run.

1531
01:49:41,785 --> 01:49:43,870
I'm going along with
the program till Sonia's free.

1532
01:49:44,704 --> 01:49:45,747
Then I do my thing.

1533
01:49:46,873 --> 01:49:49,417
You really think
it's gonna be that easy, do you?

1534
01:49:49,501 --> 01:49:50,418
Motherfucker, please.

1535
01:49:50,502 --> 01:49:52,545
You know when I want
some shit to pop, it pops.

1536
01:49:52,796 --> 01:49:54,839
Like that shot
through that tittie-small window

1537
01:49:54,923 --> 01:49:56,067
- on Kurosawa's plane.
- That's enough.

1538
01:49:56,091 --> 01:49:58,593
- Okay, that's enough out of you.
- Show me the face you made

1539
01:49:58,676 --> 01:50:00,363
- when that shit went down.
- That still stings.

1540
01:50:00,387 --> 01:50:02,239
I know you wasn't
expecting that shit to happen.

1541
01:50:02,263 --> 01:50:03,598
Yeah, I was expecting you

1542
01:50:03,681 --> 01:50:05,433
to blow my client's head off.

1543
