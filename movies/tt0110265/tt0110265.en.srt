2
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,111
Hotel Rive Gauche.

3
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:53,893
<i>Rive Gauche? Tres bien.</i>

4
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:14,117
<i>Do you mind the radio?</i>

5
00:03:14,852 --> 00:03:16,194
<i>Do you want me to turn the radio off?</i>

6
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:18,911
I don't speak French.

7
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:19,961
Ah. English?

8
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:21,854
American.

9
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,630
That's good.
I speak a little American.

10
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,697
I asked if you mind the radio.
Music... you know.

11
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:29,908
It's okay.

12
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,578
Ah. Super cool.

13
00:03:36,538 --> 00:03:37,400
Do you know what time it is?

14
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,969
I don't know. Daytime?

15
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:44,068
Are you in town for business?

16
00:03:44,184 --> 00:03:45,145
Yep.

17
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,869
It's a nice hotel, your hotel.
Very big rooms.

18
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,082
Do you know Paris?

19
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,979
Not really.

20
00:03:58,253 --> 00:04:02,000
I spent some time here a long
time ago. When I was young.

21
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,047
Oh.

22
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:06,078
Those were the days.

23
00:04:07,821 --> 00:04:08,853
Married?

24
00:04:09,485 --> 00:04:10,670
Say what?

25
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,322
Do you have a wife?

26
00:04:13,547 --> 00:04:14,715
Used to.

27
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,415
Why?

28
00:04:23,878 --> 00:04:25,950
Why, if you need a wife for the night...

29
00:04:25,989 --> 00:04:27,054
for business.

30
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:29,378
I give you my number.

31
00:04:30,852 --> 00:04:34,909
She's a very nice girl. French.
Like when you were very young.

32
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,737
Just tell me and I set it up.

33
00:04:41,311 --> 00:04:42,588
What you laughing at?

34
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,327
You let Moises set it up.

35
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:14,668
Your package... it arrived in the night,
last night before the last night.

36
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:17,995
The telephone. For room service.

37
00:05:19,343 --> 00:05:21,676
The toilet here. The door.

38
00:05:22,477 --> 00:05:25,956
And the television. Right here.

39
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:29,954
With this you can operate
it anywhere in the room.

40
00:05:29,993 --> 00:05:31,010
Great.

41
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,445
Voila.

42
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:34,578
Okay.

43
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:35,653
Well?

44
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:40,428
Oh. Okay.

45
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:48,766
There you go.

46
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:52,518
Oh, hey.

47
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,741
Do you know what time is it?

48
00:05:53,742 --> 00:05:54,932
What? I'm sorry?

49
00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:57,278
Time... time... what time it is?

50
00:05:57,278 --> 00:06:01,303
Oh. Yes. Il est presque huit heures...

51
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,649
Bon soir.

52
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:27,799
bonjour.

53
00:07:31,477 --> 00:07:32,175
Bonjour.

54
00:07:34,347 --> 00:07:35,306
Come on in.

55
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,744
Wow.

56
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:54,686
Hey, hey, hey... hold on.

57
00:07:55,403 --> 00:07:56,789
I don't speak French.

58
00:07:58,861 --> 00:08:00,971
- Speak English?
- Yes. I do.

59
00:08:02,588 --> 00:08:03,764
It's okay.

60
00:08:03,888 --> 00:08:06,652
It will be one thousand Francs
for all night.

61
00:08:06,692 --> 00:08:07,651
I don't do weird stuff.

62
00:08:08,677 --> 00:08:10,784
A condom and
you have to pay in advance.

63
00:08:10,977 --> 00:08:13,603
What kind of weird stuff don't you do?

64
00:08:13,642 --> 00:08:15,637
Like... peeing on me?

65
00:08:16,878 --> 00:08:17,837
I can't pee.

66
00:08:19,074 --> 00:08:20,187
No.

67
00:08:22,196 --> 00:08:26,800
What is a... What's a 1000 Francs
translate to in American?

68
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,109
Around 200 bucks?

69
00:08:32,602 --> 00:08:33,562
Thank you.

70
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,310
Blow job included.

71
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,393
We can do it now, if you want.

72
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:48,167
I'm going to dry off first.

73
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:50,227
Okay, but it's not necessary.

74
00:08:50,628 --> 00:08:53,211
200 bucks and I can't pee on you, huh?

75
00:08:53,212 --> 00:08:54,171
No.

76
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,327
Geez!

77
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:56,494
What's your name?

78
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:59,752
Zoe or Zoey. Which ever you like.

79
00:09:00,512 --> 00:09:01,471
Ya?

80
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,785
My name's Zed.

81
00:09:03,981 --> 00:09:06,081
That's funny.
We both have Z names.

82
00:09:08,874 --> 00:09:09,989
Say what?

83
00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:14,094
You can take those off. The pants.

84
00:09:14,517 --> 00:09:16,205
It's easier without, you know.

85
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:20,641
Think I'd rather watch you...

86
00:09:20,796 --> 00:09:21,755
get undressed first.

87
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:26,363
Okay.

88
00:09:33,152 --> 00:09:35,630
Hey, hey, hey... slowly.

89
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:37,092
Okay.

90
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:40,987
Mister America. Zed.

91
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:44,243
That's Captain America, baby.

92
00:09:47,993 --> 00:09:49,198
Slow enough for you?

93
00:12:04,638 --> 00:12:05,758
I'm cold.

94
00:12:09,487 --> 00:12:10,599
There.

95
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:18,807
Zed?

96
00:12:18,808 --> 00:12:19,922
Uhhum?

97
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:24,072
Moises told me you were in
town for business.

98
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:25,407
Uhhum.

99
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:27,308
What kind of business?

100
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:29,722
Why?

101
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:32,500
I don't know. I'm just curious.

102
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:37,921
Do you ask all your clients
questions about their business?

103
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:40,966
No.

104
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,513
Just the ones I like.

105
00:12:45,228 --> 00:12:47,332
Oh... so you like me?

106
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:50,012
Yes.

107
00:12:50,773 --> 00:12:52,110
Why?

108
00:12:53,845 --> 00:12:55,916
Because you're a good person.

109
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:58,333
I run into some real creeps.
You know.

110
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:03,192
What makes you think that
I'm a good person?

111
00:13:03,845 --> 00:13:06,658
Body language. We fit together.

112
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,197
We fit together?

113
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,719
All men and women fit together.
Hell, even some men fit together.

114
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:20,925
Ya, but you know, we clicked.

115
00:13:20,964 --> 00:13:22,581
You made me orgasm.

116
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,730
Do you know how often I orgasm
with guys Moises sets me up with?

117
00:13:28,635 --> 00:13:30,164
3 times a week?

118
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:32,298
Never.

119
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:34,660
They're always fat like pigs.

120
00:13:36,937 --> 00:13:38,318
Suck me baby.

121
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:44,556
And you make me feel safe.

122
00:13:45,873 --> 00:13:48,546
That's something more important
than the orgasm.

123
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:53,857
You know, it may be the
integral part maybe of the orgasm.

124
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,608
I never thought of it like that.

125
00:13:57,869 --> 00:13:59,113
Well, its true.

126
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:05,530
Turn off the television.

127
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,563
So I really mean it,
when I'm telling you, Zed,

128
00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:13,768
I like you very much.

129
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:15,949
I like you too.

130
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:17,746
Honest?

131
00:14:18,803 --> 00:14:19,762
Uhhum.

132
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:23,543
Why? For the same reason?

133
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,505
Any man can orgasm.
Even with his own hand.

134
00:14:29,672 --> 00:14:33,547
Well, I like you because
you just won't stop talking.

135
00:14:35,724 --> 00:14:37,105
Just keep talking.

136
00:14:38,568 --> 00:14:41,294
You're open and you're honest.

137
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:45,616
You're different than a lot of the
prostitutes that I've been with.

138
00:14:45,656 --> 00:14:47,881
I am not a prostitute!

139
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:48,841
Oh. Really?

140
00:14:49,467 --> 00:14:52,247
Great, then can I have
my 1000 Francs back?

141
00:14:52,248 --> 00:14:54,650
- I'm a student.
- Oh.

142
00:14:54,804 --> 00:14:57,234
I became an escort to pay my classes.

143
00:14:57,235 --> 00:14:58,957
It's my choice to sleep with you.

144
00:14:59,522 --> 00:15:00,569
I understand.

145
00:15:01,425 --> 00:15:02,188
No you don't.

146
00:15:02,321 --> 00:15:03,880
No, no, no... I get it.

147
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:09,076
- It's not easy.
- Hey, I didn't say it was... easy.

148
00:15:11,003 --> 00:15:13,522
It's my choice... to be here.

149
00:15:14,251 --> 00:15:15,190
Okay,

150
00:15:18,026 --> 00:15:18,985
Okay.

151
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:25,142
What kind of a student are you?

152
00:15:25,143 --> 00:15:26,524
Where do you go to school?

153
00:15:28,534 --> 00:15:29,675
Le Beaus Art

154
00:15:30,436 --> 00:15:34,028
Le Beaus Art... what's that?
Art school?

155
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:35,219
You're an artist?

156
00:15:36,386 --> 00:15:38,689
What kind of art do you study?

157
00:15:40,288 --> 00:15:42,584
Not any of the old shit.

158
00:15:42,931 --> 00:15:44,087
No?

159
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:48,137
No, I have a day job too.
Three times a week.

160
00:15:48,138 --> 00:15:49,098
Very boring.

161
00:15:53,346 --> 00:15:55,083
But one day...

162
00:15:55,698 --> 00:15:57,846
there will be only my art.

163
00:15:59,222 --> 00:16:02,377
What are you a... painter?

164
00:16:02,455 --> 00:16:06,909
I don't paint.
I make things.

165
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,521
Objects.

166
00:16:09,363 --> 00:16:12,664
Not like sculpture.
Like life...

167
00:16:13,426 --> 00:16:16,430
What I do, I do it only for the objects.

168
00:16:17,532 --> 00:16:19,505
I'd like to see one of them sometime.

169
00:16:20,015 --> 00:16:21,674
What?

170
00:16:22,174 --> 00:16:24,898
So you could see the
work of a whore?

171
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,787
I'm sorry I called you a prostitute.
All right?

172
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:33,639
I didn't know that there was a difference.

173
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:38,196
The difference is a prostitute would
have lied to you about her orgasm.

174
00:16:39,482 --> 00:16:40,633
I didn't lie.

175
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:30,920
What time is it?

176
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,134
I don't know. Night time.

177
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,412
I'm going to take a shower.

178
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:37,040
I'm coming.

179
00:17:42,335 --> 00:17:43,294
Hey!

180
00:17:43,418 --> 00:17:44,564
You're alright man!

181
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,501
What happened to you?
I thought you were going to call.

182
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:50,919
Oh, I see.

183
00:17:52,518 --> 00:17:54,501
You have been busy.

184
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:56,475
I asked the hotel for a wake up call.

185
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,980
That's good, but now I am here.
So let's go. We have a lot to talk about, man.

186
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:03,813
The girl's still here.

187
00:18:04,758 --> 00:18:06,251
- Is she your girlfriend?
- No.

188
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,927
Fuck her. She's a dishrag whore.
Kick her out. Come on.

189
00:18:08,928 --> 00:18:11,143
I'll let her stay here tonight.

190
00:18:11,144 --> 00:18:12,572
Don't be silly.
It's dangerous.

191
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:28,728
don't worry about her.

192
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,802
Oh shit. Her clothes.

193
00:19:01,513 --> 00:19:04,465
So tell me, what have you
been up to?

194
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:06,502
Eric, I liked that girl.

195
00:19:06,503 --> 00:19:10,062
Well, then why
didn't you stop me.

196
00:19:10,063 --> 00:19:11,981
You're running
around like a fucking maniac.

197
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,474
Look, your whole life you've
done nothing but fuck whores.

198
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,667
A girl like that will
give you AIDS.

199
00:19:16,706 --> 00:19:19,239
Why don't you find a
nice girl in the suburbs?

200
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,810
Because when you want to get off...

201
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,141
you don't want to wait 3 months
and spend 200 bucks to do it.

202
00:19:24,142 --> 00:19:25,484
Just use your hand like me.

203
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:30,426
Sometimes you just need
honesty... and security of a whore.

204
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:32,518
I don't understand.

205
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:35,417
Anyway, it's too late. Get dressed,
lets go out and meet the boys.

206
00:19:35,418 --> 00:19:38,143
I stink, going to take another shower.

207
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:42,352
No, in Paris it's good to smell
like you've been fucking.

208
00:19:42,353 --> 00:19:43,828
So we can respect you.

209
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:46,166
Just put on a shirt
and a sport coat. Come on.

210
00:19:56,736 --> 00:19:58,742
I'm glad you came.
How long has it been?

211
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:00,642
11 years?

212
00:20:01,298 --> 00:20:02,173
11 years.

213
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:06,353
It's amazing, you know?

214
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:09,801
Here you are.
One day in America. Now here.

215
00:20:10,384 --> 00:20:11,534
Ya.

216
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:16,499
Well, to to tell you the truth, there wasn't
a lot happening for me back in the States.

217
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:19,782
But in Paris your old friend Eric has a
job for you, so you came. That's good.

218
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:21,670
How could I resist your invitation?

219
00:20:22,164 --> 00:20:24,048
You would have been stupid to.

220
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:26,228
Well...

221
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:30,780
- I'm not that stupid.
- No, not yet.

222
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:36,804
So what have you been doing
for the past 11 years?

223
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:43,367
After school I spent some time in
Algeria studying African philosophy.

224
00:20:44,598 --> 00:20:47,053
And then I bummed around.
You know. For fun.

225
00:20:47,985 --> 00:20:50,981
For a while I worked at Le Figaro.
The newspaper.

226
00:20:50,982 --> 00:20:52,535
You know? Le Figaro?

227
00:20:53,204 --> 00:20:55,505
Ya? Wow.

228
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,566
Yes. With an assumed masters degree.

229
00:21:00,587 --> 00:21:04,927
And lately we have just been
bombing fascists here in Paris.
You know, like terrorists.

230
00:21:06,388 --> 00:21:07,347
It's fun.

231
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:13,057
What the fuck is he doing?

232
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,469
Ass hole!

233
00:21:48,868 --> 00:21:50,940
Kitty.
Here, kitty cat.

234
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:56,515
Is this cat dead?

235
00:21:56,554 --> 00:22:00,826
I don't know. I think it's a sleep
but it's been there for days.

236
00:22:04,397 --> 00:22:06,903
I guess it is dead. Ya.
Come on.

237
00:22:11,805 --> 00:22:14,467
The people next door on holiday.
We took their phone.

238
00:22:14,468 --> 00:22:17,806
If you want to make a
long distance call, go ahead.

239
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,365
How are you doing?

240
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,276
Okay. Oliver is from England.

241
00:22:49,277 --> 00:22:50,236
- Claude.
- et voila.

242
00:22:50,531 --> 00:22:51,490
Ricardo... Quebec.

243
00:22:51,491 --> 00:22:54,882
Francois, Oliver, Jean, who knows. Eric.

244
00:22:55,513 --> 00:22:56,788
They all know who you are.

245
00:23:02,254 --> 00:23:04,433
Can I get you anything to drink, sir?

246
00:23:05,094 --> 00:23:06,180
Beer?

247
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,169
Thanks.

248
00:23:07,861 --> 00:23:10,282
I mean come here. Hey, Sit.

249
00:23:22,055 --> 00:23:25,568
Easy, easy. Don't scare him.
He's just trying to claim you.

250
00:23:26,715 --> 00:23:29,910
Let me introduce you properly.
That is Enrique.

251
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,570
He likes to be called chim chim,

252
00:23:32,571 --> 00:23:35,944
but we don't always get what we like...
do we?

253
00:23:35,945 --> 00:23:38,019
Enrique! Taistoi!

254
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,048
Get out!

255
00:23:42,516 --> 00:23:44,204
I hate monkeys.

256
00:23:46,785 --> 00:23:48,998
- Do you like hashish?
- Oh ya.

257
00:23:50,589 --> 00:23:53,402
Don't sit next to that junkie.

258
00:23:58,594 --> 00:24:01,205
Your little shit monkey pissed
on my Billy Holiday album.

259
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,824
- Next time he's out the door. Okay?
- Okay okay!

260
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,995
Zed, come here.

261
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:25,028
Don't ask me where we got this, okay?

262
00:24:25,201 --> 00:24:26,160
Where did you get this?

263
00:24:27,184 --> 00:24:29,214
On Bastille Day, all the banks are closed.

264
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:31,022
But this one. BIP.

265
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:33,655
The Banque Internationale de Paris.

266
00:24:33,656 --> 00:24:37,901
And for being greedy capitalists, perhaps
they will remain closed next Bastille Day. Ay?

267
00:24:39,236 --> 00:24:41,500
This is the only entrance. Good.

268
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:44,591
We will go in and
shut the bank down.

269
00:24:44,592 --> 00:24:46,504
Now, look at this.

270
00:24:47,417 --> 00:24:50,255
As you can see,
only one person can start the alarm.

271
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:53,636
The concierge, at this desk.

272
00:24:54,373 --> 00:24:55,317
We will take care of him.

273
00:24:55,356 --> 00:24:56,493
Then we can close the bank.

274
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:59,454
No one will know the difference since
every other bank will be closed.

275
00:24:59,455 --> 00:25:02,228
What makes you think
he's not going to press the alarm?

276
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,350
He's right next to the door.

277
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:07,554
We'd have to be totally incompetent
not to stop him. Don't worry about that.

278
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:14,109
Here. This is where they keep the days
reserve cash. Okay fuck that.

279
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:16,772
There are many vaults downstairs,

280
00:25:17,389 --> 00:25:21,322
but this is the vault we must get into.
This is where the real prize is.

281
00:25:21,323 --> 00:25:22,523
What kind of vault is that?

282
00:25:22,524 --> 00:25:25,271
Ah... Swiss made. A Caliber.

283
00:25:25,656 --> 00:25:26,805
Caliber.

284
00:25:27,688 --> 00:25:30,137
That will take...

285
00:25:30,138 --> 00:25:32,313
- Three hours.
- No, Zed, that's too long.

286
00:25:32,314 --> 00:25:33,364
That's how long it'll take.

287
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,864
Well shit. It's too long.
We have to be in and out like that.
Or there will be suspicion.

288
00:25:36,904 --> 00:25:38,566
A little time is okay...
but too long and...

289
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:40,817
Hold on... what is this?

290
00:25:42,423 --> 00:25:43,412
Another vault.

291
00:25:43,413 --> 00:25:45,697
No, no, no, no... this.

292
00:25:46,043 --> 00:25:48,681
I don't know...
it connects the two vaults.

293
00:25:48,682 --> 00:25:50,617
What kind of vault is
the other one?

294
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:52,647
Also Swiss,
but this one is a Poseidon.

295
00:25:52,648 --> 00:25:53,799
Poseidon.

296
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:58,272
Why would those two vaults
be connected?

297
00:25:58,312 --> 00:25:59,620
No idea. I don't know.

298
00:26:00,864 --> 00:26:06,115
Because... I can get into the Poseidon
in a half an hour. Maybe less.

299
00:26:06,154 --> 00:26:09,022
Yes, but this entry way is too
small to get the platen out.

300
00:26:09,023 --> 00:26:10,585
We have a lot of
merchandise in there.

301
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:13,115
No, no. Don't you see?
We get in to the secondary vault.

302
00:26:13,116 --> 00:26:16,091
We take this passage into the Caliber vault.

303
00:26:16,131 --> 00:26:19,390
And from the inside I can open it in
five minutes.

304
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:21,458
Well... you could open it in five minutes?

305
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:22,478
From the inside its easy.

306
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:24,235
Hot damn. That is our answer, man.

307
00:26:24,236 --> 00:26:25,284
Okay.

308
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,431
When is Bastille Day?

309
00:26:28,452 --> 00:26:29,247
Tomorrow.

310
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,987
Tomorrow!?
We're doing this tomorrow?

311
00:26:32,065 --> 00:26:33,967
Well of course, yes.

312
00:26:34,056 --> 00:26:35,058
It's impossible.

313
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:37,760
No, it's not impossible.
Everyone knows what to do.

314
00:26:37,761 --> 00:26:38,931
I don't know what to do.

315
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:42,228
But you don't need to know shit. Just get
into the vault and we'll do the rest then.

316
00:26:42,228 --> 00:26:43,470
I haven't even seen the bank.

317
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:47,073
Fuck the bank.
Before we do a job we live life.

318
00:26:47,074 --> 00:26:48,503
It's better that way. Okay?

319
00:26:54,193 --> 00:26:55,273
Okay.

320
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:56,562
Good.

321
00:26:56,947 --> 00:26:58,750
Now we do heroin!

322
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:02,761
You do a little heroin?

323
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,597
Some beer, hash...

324
00:28:05,636 --> 00:28:07,712
something... you feel...

325
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:08,765
just right.

326
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:11,160
Maybe later.

327
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:14,101
As you wish.

328
00:28:18,556 --> 00:28:20,474
Come on. Try some.

329
00:28:23,772 --> 00:28:26,524
It's called chasing the dragon.

330
00:28:26,525 --> 00:28:29,752
The Chinese have been
doing it for centuries.

331
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,251
I probably shouldn't, but...

332
00:28:35,252 --> 00:28:37,192
But you must.

333
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:39,739
If you do it,

334
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,142
it will make you feel

335
00:28:41,143 --> 00:28:42,291
as though

336
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:44,288
the rest of the world is

337
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,155
in a bubble of glass

338
00:28:46,156 --> 00:28:48,389
and you are rubbing up against it

339
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,208
like a bad windshield wiper.

340
00:28:55,112 --> 00:28:57,989
I think I'll do it anyway.

341
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:10,134
There. That's the Firarri...

342
00:29:10,173 --> 00:29:10,897
Where?

343
00:29:10,972 --> 00:29:12,352
- Right there.
- Zed...

344
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:15,238
do you like French cars?
French cars.

345
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:16,172
- Do you like them?
- Yes.

346
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:17,121
I like the Cadillac.

347
00:29:18,075 --> 00:29:21,621
53 through 75. Very nice.

348
00:29:22,082 --> 00:29:24,416
Up here,
you can see the Eiffel Tower. Look

349
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:25,376
Very nice.

350
00:29:25,491 --> 00:29:26,920
Is tomorrow really Bastille Day?

351
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:29,949
Yes, tomorrow we pull
the biggest job in French history.

352
00:29:29,988 --> 00:29:33,045
And spend the rest of our lives in...

353
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,319
Monte Carlo.

354
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:37,084
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

355
00:29:38,582 --> 00:29:40,424
Hey!

356
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,556
That car's a piece of shit!

357
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:11,470
Watch it! don't crash my car.
Come on!

358
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,589
This way...

359
00:30:23,045 --> 00:30:25,214
this is where the male prostitutes
sell themselves.

360
00:30:25,587 --> 00:30:27,016
Fucking fagots!

361
00:30:32,737 --> 00:30:35,077
Dr. Suce ma tobre.

362
00:30:38,792 --> 00:30:39,751
What does that mean?

363
00:30:40,995 --> 00:30:43,336
I will tell you later. Okay?
Couilles.

364
00:30:43,524 --> 00:30:45,619
This is good to have you here.

365
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,454
We could not do this without you.

366
00:30:47,337 --> 00:30:50,349
Everyone has agreed to give you
double shares. That's good, no?

367
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,146
That's good.

368
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,698
Ricardo, what I was telling you was...

369
00:30:53,828 --> 00:30:58,479
in a final conflict between 6 and
number 2 to find out who is number 1,

370
00:30:58,518 --> 00:31:01,277
number 6 realizes that
he is number 1, you know?

371
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:04,260
It's like we're all a prisoner
of ourselves. You know?

372
00:31:04,261 --> 00:31:08,152
But the best episode is
"A, B and C" where...

373
00:31:08,153 --> 00:31:13,126
he takes 3 drugs and he realizes
3 different alternative realities.

374
00:31:13,127 --> 00:31:15,076
And uh...

375
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:20,381
You know I have AIDS.

376
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:22,700
From the needle.

377
00:31:23,797 --> 00:31:24,965
What?

378
00:31:26,238 --> 00:31:30,155
Hey, look... up here is the
Arc de Triomphe. Come on. Look!

379
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:24,582
So, how long have you known Eric?

380
00:32:25,423 --> 00:32:26,574
Since...

381
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,104
19...

382
00:32:31,706 --> 00:32:33,663
I was 12.

383
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:34,691
And he... ah...

384
00:32:35,526 --> 00:32:37,309
His mother's American.

385
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,375
Yeah, his dad is French.

386
00:32:41,244 --> 00:32:45,072
And they divorced, and had some
weird custody plan or...

387
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:50,108
He would spend 6 months with her
in Florida and then 6 months here.

388
00:32:50,457 --> 00:32:51,416
Anyway...

389
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:54,652
they just lived 2 houses up from me,

390
00:32:58,646 --> 00:33:00,658
Well, it's good to
have you here, man.

391
00:33:00,698 --> 00:33:01,973
Eric loves you.

392
00:33:03,297 --> 00:33:06,052
Tells me you like Viking films.
Is that right?

393
00:33:07,574 --> 00:33:09,109
Viking movies?

394
00:33:09,842 --> 00:33:11,568
Ya. I guess.

395
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,112
I love that stuff... just, helmets
with the fucking horns on...

396
00:33:15,228 --> 00:33:16,187
Right

397
00:33:16,283 --> 00:33:18,661
That's what we should be
wearing tomorrow, right?

398
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:21,615
If you ever want to see it,
I've got some videos...

399
00:33:21,655 --> 00:33:24,839
Viking stuff made in Norway,
which is excellent.

400
00:33:30,907 --> 00:33:34,145
What about this music?
Do you like dixieland?

401
00:33:35,394 --> 00:33:37,407
Yeah... I guess.

402
00:33:37,408 --> 00:33:40,784
I live for this music, man.
This is real music.

403
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:46,089
It's got a heart and a culture
all of it's own.

404
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:51,750
And it bears no resemblance to anything
else in this entire fucking planet.

405
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:57,260
It's just total... purity of essence.

406
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:58,333
Yeah.

407
00:33:59,145 --> 00:34:01,438
"When the Saints Go Marching In".

408
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:04,544
Hey... "When the Saints Go Marching In".

409
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,307
Hey, here, have some wine.
It's very good.

410
00:34:06,598 --> 00:34:09,956
You don't want to drink this shit,
it's poison.

411
00:34:11,607 --> 00:34:13,168
I bring my own... vodka.

412
00:34:13,354 --> 00:34:14,313
Look up on stage!

413
00:34:15,611 --> 00:34:17,573
You crazy fucking Frenchmen!

414
00:34:23,136 --> 00:34:24,901
Oh my God!

415
00:35:06,349 --> 00:35:08,538
Hey! How was I?

416
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:11,184
I didn't know you could play.

417
00:35:11,185 --> 00:35:14,544
I can't. But it's easy.
You just slide the thing, you know.

418
00:35:21,715 --> 00:35:23,221
Do you like this place?

419
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:23,940
Yeah.

420
00:35:23,941 --> 00:35:25,953
Good. This is the real Paris.

421
00:35:25,992 --> 00:35:27,365
Here in the cellar.

422
00:35:27,366 --> 00:35:30,291
Up there... on the street,
all just street trash.

423
00:35:30,292 --> 00:35:34,048
You have Pompidou Center,
the Eiffel Tower... all that tourist shit.

424
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,008
La Louvre. Ahh... good God!

425
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,196
The fucking Louvre.

426
00:35:37,197 --> 00:35:40,200
All of that is for the guide buses.

427
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:42,447
Even the people,
Parisians, they are shit.

428
00:35:42,448 --> 00:35:44,210
No one in France likes them.
It's true.

429
00:35:44,211 --> 00:35:46,732
But down here...

430
00:35:46,733 --> 00:35:49,433
away from everyone up there,
the tourists, the attractions,

431
00:35:49,433 --> 00:35:53,114
the fucking postcards,
people change.

432
00:35:53,114 --> 00:35:56,740
They forget, because they can not see,
that they are in Paris.

433
00:35:56,741 --> 00:35:59,415
- It could be anywhere.
- The music, the food

434
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:00,888
the wine.

435
00:36:00,889 --> 00:36:02,709
Even the wine's okay.

436
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,561
So what do you think? Eh?

437
00:36:06,721 --> 00:36:08,276
What do you think of Paris, Zed?

438
00:36:08,277 --> 00:36:10,531
Come on, Zed, tell me.

439
00:36:10,532 --> 00:36:14,498
Well, if this is Paris...

440
00:36:14,499 --> 00:36:16,589
then I like it.

441
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,801
Come on! Lets dance.

442
00:36:18,273 --> 00:36:20,127
No! I'll puke!

443
00:37:08,497 --> 00:37:12,420
Hey, Zed, come on.
Just snort this with your nose.

444
00:37:13,538 --> 00:37:15,843
What's going on?
Why don't you do some?

445
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:20,109
Come on. Come on my friend.

446
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,973
Shouldn't we be doing this
somewhere more private?

447
00:37:24,215 --> 00:37:26,122
Fuck them.
They can get their own.

448
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:29,852
No, I mean, is it safe...

449
00:37:30,467 --> 00:37:31,981
to do it here?

450
00:37:31,982 --> 00:37:33,258
What!? From the police?

451
00:37:35,356 --> 00:37:36,315
Sit down.

452
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,154
Doing heroin here is
safer than in Amsterdam.

453
00:37:40,155 --> 00:37:41,463
I shouldn't do any more.

454
00:37:41,706 --> 00:37:42,571
But you must.

455
00:37:42,572 --> 00:37:43,841
Thank you.

456
00:37:43,901 --> 00:37:46,235
But if you want to
feel good then why not?

457
00:37:46,236 --> 00:37:48,421
I'm really tired.

458
00:37:49,782 --> 00:37:51,694
You only live once, man.

459
00:37:54,529 --> 00:37:57,828
Doing it with the nose,
hardly even affect me.

460
00:39:38,574 --> 00:39:41,898
Why do you talk with
street trash like that? Eh?

461
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:43,758
I wasn't...

462
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:46,761
Whatever. Come on,
I want to talk to you.

463
00:39:46,822 --> 00:39:48,126
Come on.

464
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:57,417
Meaty pussy, man.

465
00:40:11,266 --> 00:40:12,226
Oh God!

466
00:40:16,608 --> 00:40:18,047
- Open your mouth.
- No.

467
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,529
Shut up. Open your mouth.

468
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,487
- You need it.
- I...

469
00:40:23,773 --> 00:40:25,445
To see Paris, you need it.

470
00:40:25,446 --> 00:40:27,172
Zed, now swallow.

471
00:40:27,354 --> 00:40:28,313
Now swallow, swallow it.

472
00:40:36,856 --> 00:40:37,815
Good.

473
00:40:39,733 --> 00:40:41,113
What was that?

474
00:40:41,114 --> 00:40:44,625
It's new. It's good.
Take a deep breath.

475
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:49,477
I wanted to tell you Zed...

476
00:40:51,245 --> 00:40:53,952
there are others here in Paris.

477
00:40:53,991 --> 00:40:56,127
others that could
open that vault.

478
00:40:56,511 --> 00:40:58,624
There are others in
Germany and Switzerland,

479
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,973
one in Belgium...
all could do the job.

480
00:41:01,671 --> 00:41:02,630
But...

481
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:05,716
I don't need those assholes.

482
00:41:05,717 --> 00:41:06,437
Why?

483
00:41:06,438 --> 00:41:07,779
Because I have you.

484
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,762
I have the only man
I can trust in the whole world.

485
00:41:12,997 --> 00:41:15,977
My very good friend
who I look up to... hey.

486
00:41:17,403 --> 00:41:19,268
You are the one. Hey?

487
00:41:19,346 --> 00:41:21,723
You are the one, Zed... Zed.

488
00:41:24,707 --> 00:41:26,317
It's good to see you.

489
00:41:28,095 --> 00:41:29,023
You know what I'm saying?

490
00:41:29,024 --> 00:41:30,712
It's good.

491
00:41:30,898 --> 00:41:34,529
- What... did you give me?
- Nothing.

492
00:41:34,913 --> 00:41:35,690
Nothing, Zed.

493
00:41:35,691 --> 00:41:37,990
Don't sweat it.

494
00:41:41,235 --> 00:41:42,194
Hey, hey, hey.

495
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:46,801
I'm going to die.

496
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,022
We all die.

497
00:41:49,023 --> 00:41:52,535
The important thing is that in
life we experience everything, Zed.

498
00:41:52,574 --> 00:41:54,829
You know what I'm saying?
You know?

499
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:57,497
- No.
- No.

500
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,062
Tomorrow is the greatest day
of our lives.

501
00:42:03,269 --> 00:42:06,838
The beginning of our lives, Zed.

502
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:09,677
The end of the complication.

503
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,795
- Do you have fire?
- Aye?

504
00:42:15,313 --> 00:42:16,272
Franחois

505
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:19,825
Before, when we would make a bomb,
to blow up a cafe or something,

506
00:42:19,826 --> 00:42:23,874
it would cost us a week's wage
working at the fucking newspaper.

507
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:31,103
And for me, it was one week
and one half week.

508
00:43:09,202 --> 00:43:12,203
Wake up sleepy head.
C'mon. We have a bank to rob.

509
00:43:12,204 --> 00:43:14,632
I can get you some eggs
sunny side up.

510
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,469
I feel like I drank furniture polish.

511
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:17,446
You did.

512
00:43:17,447 --> 00:43:19,455
It's that Spanish wine you drank, man,
I warned you.

513
00:43:19,456 --> 00:43:22,127
Okay look, you should get ready.
The bank will be open for three hours today

514
00:43:22,128 --> 00:43:23,273
and traffic will be hell.

515
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,710
I need to get my equipment.

516
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,707
Oh, but we went by
your hotel last night.

517
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:29,252
Don't you remember?

518
00:43:29,253 --> 00:43:30,343
We have all your things here.

519
00:43:30,344 --> 00:43:33,413
So get up and
take a shit so we can go.

520
00:43:50,991 --> 00:43:52,229
How's this going to work?

521
00:43:52,412 --> 00:43:54,788
We go in. We get what we want.
We come out.

522
00:43:54,789 --> 00:43:58,480
Once we get in we will wear these to
cover our faces. Just in case. Okay?

523
00:43:58,481 --> 00:43:59,792
Gonna have video cameras?

524
00:43:59,793 --> 00:44:02,129
Of course they are. But we've taken care
of that. So don't worry.

525
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:05,296
Everyone knows what to do,
so just do your job and we will all be fine.

526
00:44:05,297 --> 00:44:06,312
So don't worry.

527
00:44:06,313 --> 00:44:07,656
Okay... and be happy.

528
00:44:08,692 --> 00:44:09,750
What?

529
00:44:09,751 --> 00:44:10,796
Your gun.

530
00:44:10,797 --> 00:44:12,241
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

531
00:44:24,011 --> 00:44:26,864
Just follow us. don't say anything.
It will go smooth.

532
00:44:26,865 --> 00:44:30,881
Just like the old days, eh?
Except its no longer the minimart. Yes?

533
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,353
Hey! I can open the vault!

534
00:49:18,354 --> 00:49:20,227
Shut the fuck up!

535
00:50:18,045 --> 00:50:21,103
Don't you ever conflict with me
during work again! Do you hear!?

536
00:50:21,104 --> 00:50:22,420
You didn't have to
kill anyone!

537
00:50:22,421 --> 00:50:25,859
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were
in charge now. Nobody told me that.

538
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,319
If he had opened the vault it
would have saved us a fucking hour.

539
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,571
Great. So we've gone
from being thieves to murderers.

540
00:50:30,572 --> 00:50:34,637
Oh fuck it doesn't matter!
Here you get the death penalty
just for robbing a federal bank.

541
00:50:34,638 --> 00:50:36,384
I thought they abolished
the death penalty.

542
00:50:36,385 --> 00:50:38,681
Oh! That's what they tell you!
So who cares?

543
00:50:38,682 --> 00:50:39,971
I need to take a piss.

544
00:50:39,972 --> 00:50:41,597
Why don't you open the vault?

545
00:50:42,193 --> 00:50:43,626
Here.

546
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:45,814
I don't give a shit about this.

547
00:56:14,815 --> 00:56:17,664
Zed, what is it?
What's going on?

548
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:18,854
What?

549
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:24,729
Nothing, nothing.
Just stay here, okay?

550
00:56:56,267 --> 00:56:57,802
What the fuck is going on?

551
00:57:03,372 --> 00:57:04,532
Oh shit.

552
00:57:04,533 --> 00:57:07,625
Who gives a damn if they see us anyway!
I can't see a fucking think in this!

553
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,943
This is insane!
I'm a U.S. Citizen!

554
00:57:39,229 --> 00:57:41,203
I'm just here exchanging dollars.

555
00:57:42,171 --> 00:57:44,013
You must let me go.
I'm an American.

556
00:57:44,446 --> 00:57:46,292
You know? From America?

557
00:57:46,293 --> 00:57:47,775
US of A?

558
00:57:47,776 --> 00:57:50,003
Come on! Do you understand English?

559
00:57:50,004 --> 00:57:50,950
If it wasn't for my country

560
00:57:50,951 --> 00:57:53,155
you'd all be speaking German!

561
00:58:49,697 --> 00:58:51,040
They are dead.

562
00:58:51,258 --> 00:58:52,563
Check the window.

563
00:59:09,451 --> 00:59:11,408
Oh my God!
It's the police!

564
00:59:16,255 --> 00:59:17,214
Shit!

565
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:18,805
Okay.

566
01:01:12,106 --> 01:01:12,868
What's going on?

567
01:01:13,632 --> 01:01:15,159
Nothing.

568
01:01:15,262 --> 01:01:16,919
He was just scaring them, you know.

569
01:01:19,639 --> 01:01:20,850
Well, did you tell them
to shut up?

570
01:01:22,448 --> 01:01:26,011
Yes. They're assholes.
Just having fun.

571
01:01:26,012 --> 01:01:28,313
So... how does it work?

572
01:01:28,411 --> 01:01:29,714
Fucked up my drill bit.

573
01:01:29,715 --> 01:01:32,604
It's okay.
You can buy another one.

574
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:35,821
Keep your fingers crossed.

575
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:45,035
Perfect.

576
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:48,535
Excellent, excellent.
What next?

577
01:01:48,536 --> 01:01:50,301
We find the fuse box.

578
01:01:50,302 --> 01:01:54,082
- It's okay. I'll find it for you.
- No. I need to see it myself.

579
01:01:54,429 --> 01:01:58,136
I think it would be better if
I looked for you. I could...

580
01:01:58,393 --> 01:01:59,986
It's right here.

581
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:09,788
Now, when I tell you to, you throw
this switch off and back on again.

582
01:02:10,031 --> 01:02:13,004
Any other switch
may set off the alarm.

583
01:02:13,005 --> 01:02:15,557
Oh, I wouldn't want to do that, man.

584
01:02:15,742 --> 01:02:16,533
Got it?

585
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:17,457
Got it.

586
01:03:11,178 --> 01:03:12,467
- Ready?
- Ready.

587
01:03:13,138 --> 01:03:14,097
Go.

588
01:03:24,992 --> 01:03:25,892
It worked.

589
01:03:28,315 --> 01:03:30,353
Oh my God... it worked!

590
01:03:33,072 --> 01:03:35,374
- Good job, man, good job.
- Open.

591
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:45,354
No problem, dime store quality.
Three minutes max.

592
01:03:45,645 --> 01:03:48,254
Sounds good. Then do it,
we don't have all day, man.

593
01:03:48,748 --> 01:03:50,512
Get out, go!

594
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:55,253
Fuck!

595
01:03:59,183 --> 01:04:00,360
Another security guard?

596
01:04:01,166 --> 01:04:02,344
Ya, must be.

597
01:04:07,337 --> 01:04:08,859
I peed my pants.

598
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:10,582
Hey, me too.

599
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:11,777
Hey!

600
01:04:11,778 --> 01:04:12,787
Is everything okay, man?

601
01:04:12,788 --> 01:04:14,121
What's happening?

602
01:04:14,122 --> 01:04:16,271
Nice hole in the vault,
come on, come on.

603
01:04:19,194 --> 01:04:20,002
What are you worried about

604
01:04:20,003 --> 01:04:21,901
blast his fucking ass!
It's three against one!

605
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:22,672
Shut up!

606
01:04:23,087 --> 01:04:23,947
I'm only trying to help. All right?

607
01:04:24,131 --> 01:04:25,691
Just let me think, man.

608
01:04:25,822 --> 01:04:27,316
You don't have to snap at me.

609
01:04:29,386 --> 01:04:30,345
Hey.

610
01:04:47,312 --> 01:04:48,806
What is this guys problem?

611
01:05:33,392 --> 01:05:34,293
What the hell are you doing?

612
01:05:39,642 --> 01:05:40,575
Okay.

613
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:42,619
Eric, you can't do this.
This is way too much.

614
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:43,343
It's too dangerous.

615
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:47,440
I like danger.
Yes. I do.

616
01:06:52,555 --> 01:06:53,862
That isn't funny, man.

617
01:06:54,208 --> 01:06:56,587
You guys are a bunch
of hysterical fucking pricks.

618
01:06:57,012 --> 01:07:00,393
Come on...
Let's go check out the damage.

619
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:05,835
Zed look!

620
01:07:05,895 --> 01:07:07,988
I beat you!
I opened it in under three minutes.

621
01:07:08,084 --> 01:07:09,849
I'm great... I'm so great!

622
01:07:11,109 --> 01:07:14,326
You go around to the other main vault door.

623
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:17,549
Wait for me out there.

624
01:07:18,084 --> 01:07:19,293
When I tell you, open it up.

625
01:07:19,929 --> 01:07:20,888
Sorry? What were you saying?

626
01:07:20,904 --> 01:07:22,553
Go around the other vault door.

627
01:07:54,287 --> 01:07:55,333
We're all rich!

628
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:20,949
Here.

629
01:08:26,858 --> 01:08:27,557
Look at it!

630
01:08:34,347 --> 01:08:36,500
I'm going to show the others.

631
01:08:47,634 --> 01:08:48,785
Zed?

632
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,001
We are rich, man!

633
01:08:54,804 --> 01:08:56,363
We're not out of here yet.

634
01:08:56,753 --> 01:08:58,858
Yes, but we're rich!

635
01:11:52,147 --> 01:11:53,106
Lucky day.

636
01:14:30,715 --> 01:14:32,632
Okay. Oliver, open it up.

637
01:14:37,051 --> 01:14:38,010
Hey!

638
01:14:38,011 --> 01:14:40,582
Okay, Oliver, open it up!

639
01:14:42,863 --> 01:14:43,823
Hey!

640
01:14:45,228 --> 01:14:46,187
Let me out of here!

641
01:14:48,689 --> 01:14:50,607
- Oliver!
- Okay.

642
01:14:53,318 --> 01:14:54,277
Hello?

643
01:14:54,621 --> 01:14:55,887
Ya. Hang on.

644
01:14:58,348 --> 01:15:00,031
Turn the dial.

645
01:15:01,613 --> 01:15:02,764
Turning.

646
01:15:08,052 --> 01:15:09,318
Where were you? Asleep?

647
01:15:18,127 --> 01:15:19,954
That's incredible.
I've never seen anything like it.

648
01:15:19,955 --> 01:15:21,375
Give me a hand, will you?

649
01:15:22,370 --> 01:15:23,329
It's wonderful!

650
01:15:23,591 --> 01:15:24,550
Ya, come on.

651
01:15:25,159 --> 01:15:26,118
Move it.

652
01:15:27,595 --> 01:15:28,643
What happened to the guard?

653
01:15:29,634 --> 01:15:30,593
Dead.

654
01:15:31,653 --> 01:15:33,725
Fuck! Fuck!

655
01:16:24,608 --> 01:16:26,135
Should we get some cash while we're here?

656
01:16:28,337 --> 01:16:29,132
What for?

657
01:16:29,964 --> 01:16:31,460
So we can celebrate tonight.

658
01:16:33,945 --> 01:16:35,941
You wouldn't be able to spend it anywhere.

659
01:16:36,019 --> 01:16:37,738
It's too easily traceable.

660
01:16:37,892 --> 01:16:40,863
You sure wouldn't be able
to exchange it either.

661
01:16:41,286 --> 01:16:43,878
But other than that,
it's a really good idea.

662
01:16:44,612 --> 01:16:45,572
Ya, I suppose you're right.

663
01:17:07,799 --> 01:17:09,909
So what are you going to do
with your account, man?

664
01:17:10,447 --> 01:17:11,406
I don't know.

665
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:15,582
I'd like to buy an Island.

666
01:17:16,139 --> 01:17:17,098
South Pacific.

667
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:21,002
Put my ex-wife on it.

668
01:17:22,615 --> 01:17:23,574
Never see her again.

669
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:27,062
Oh, really?
Got any kids?

670
01:17:27,063 --> 01:17:28,789
Not that I know of.

671
01:17:30,538 --> 01:17:31,497
Ya, me too.

672
01:17:33,856 --> 01:17:35,518
What about you?

673
01:17:35,519 --> 01:17:37,399
I'm going to get a Harley.

674
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:40,558
I might go to South America, you know.

675
01:17:40,636 --> 01:17:42,925
I hear that's where the drugs from.

676
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:46,303
Just get much... just store it
all up in a shack somewhere.

677
01:17:46,304 --> 01:17:50,601
And live there like a king for the rest of
my life. Never having to run, or whatever.

678
01:17:51,793 --> 01:17:53,908
We got something to cover this up with?

679
01:17:54,266 --> 01:17:55,769
What for?

680
01:17:57,782 --> 01:17:59,711
We can't exactly like walk through a bank,

681
01:17:59,751 --> 01:18:02,698
out on the street with a platten of gold.
It's going to look a little...

682
01:18:04,425 --> 01:18:06,156
It's not going to matter much now,
is it.

683
01:18:06,157 --> 01:18:09,837
The police have a rough idea
of what we're up to.

684
01:18:09,838 --> 01:18:10,890
What?

685
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:12,136
You don't know?

686
01:18:12,137 --> 01:18:13,345
Know what?

687
01:18:13,461 --> 01:18:16,352
They're outside,
but Eric's got it under control.

688
01:18:16,353 --> 01:18:19,169
He's talking to them right now.

689
01:18:19,518 --> 01:18:22,571
What the hell are you talking about?
The cops are here?

690
01:18:22,611 --> 01:18:24,145
Don't worry, man...

691
01:18:24,695 --> 01:18:26,651
Saints Go Marching In.

692
01:18:41,515 --> 01:18:42,781
Hey!

693
01:18:43,291 --> 01:18:44,683
What the fuck are you doing!?

694
01:18:47,959 --> 01:18:49,606
Give me that!

695
01:18:59,459 --> 01:19:01,377
What the fuck you doing man?

696
01:19:02,067 --> 01:19:03,218
Hey?

697
01:19:13,631 --> 01:19:14,974
Get up!

698
01:19:16,196 --> 01:19:18,562
Do you really love your bitch
whore girlfriend that much?

699
01:19:19,052 --> 01:19:20,393
She's really fucked
with your mind.

700
01:19:20,394 --> 01:19:22,082
What the fuck
are you talking about?

701
01:19:22,116 --> 01:19:24,752
Look at it.
It's all for us.

702
01:19:24,753 --> 01:19:26,974
The attention, the smoke.

703
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:29,618
They have no idea of who
they're dealing with, Zed.

704
01:19:29,619 --> 01:19:31,686
They have no idea what kind of men we are.

705
01:19:31,687 --> 01:19:35,431
A bunch of fucking idiot boneheads men,
that's what kind of men we are.

706
01:19:35,431 --> 01:19:38,282
You can no longer be in our club.

707
01:19:38,283 --> 01:19:40,071
You forfeit your cut of the pie.

708
01:19:40,589 --> 01:19:44,890
Oh, gee, I guess this means
our friendship is in trouble.

709
01:19:44,891 --> 01:19:46,231
Oh shit!

710
01:19:46,944 --> 01:19:51,049
I haven't seen you in years.
You hardly know me.

711
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,711
Never let a girl
come between two men.

712
01:20:04,889 --> 01:20:05,848
Eric!

713
01:20:10,143 --> 01:20:11,102
Eric!

714
01:20:12,903 --> 01:20:13,862
Eric!

715
01:20:14,628 --> 01:20:15,587
Eric!

716
01:20:24,963 --> 01:20:25,922
Eric!

717
01:20:40,203 --> 01:20:41,162
Bastards!

718
01:20:45,749 --> 01:20:47,874
Nice work...

719
01:20:50,023 --> 01:20:52,253
Oh, fuck! Claude!

720
01:20:52,361 --> 01:20:53,480
Oliver!

721
01:20:53,597 --> 01:20:54,939
Claude's dead!

722
01:20:59,194 --> 01:21:00,153
Zed!

723
01:21:00,756 --> 01:21:01,575
Zoe...

724
01:21:03,383 --> 01:21:04,876
They've hurt you.

725
01:21:13,923 --> 01:21:14,883
This is the end!

726
01:21:16,472 --> 01:21:17,431
Where are we going?

727
01:21:18,437 --> 01:21:20,713
We're going to lock ourselves
in one of the vaults.

728
01:21:20,714 --> 01:21:22,670
Each one of them is still open.

729
01:21:22,949 --> 01:21:24,790
Come with me.

730
01:21:27,662 --> 01:21:28,622
Hey!

731
01:21:28,623 --> 01:21:31,346
Oh! I'm sorry. I didn't know you were there.

732
01:21:32,558 --> 01:21:34,284
What can I do?

733
01:21:36,637 --> 01:21:37,596
Bastard!

734
01:21:43,321 --> 01:21:45,200
Hey, you're still my friend!

735
01:21:48,454 --> 01:21:50,142
I'm all right. I'm all right.

736
01:21:56,679 --> 01:21:57,903
Listen...

737
01:21:59,641 --> 01:22:01,175
there's no gunfire.

738
01:22:12,986 --> 01:22:15,440
This is the best time of my fucking life!

739
01:22:18,204 --> 01:22:21,586
C'mon, we'll be safer in here.

740
01:22:38,473 --> 01:22:39,432
Zed.

741
01:22:42,105 --> 01:22:44,062
How are you doing? Huh?

742
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:45,099
Good?

743
01:22:45,716 --> 01:22:47,174
I'm doing great.

744
01:22:48,058 --> 01:22:50,263
What's your girlfriend's name?

745
01:22:50,264 --> 01:22:51,407
Zoe.

746
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,902
Zoe. Oh...

747
01:22:54,995 --> 01:22:56,145
It's a beautiful name.

748
01:22:57,779 --> 01:23:00,503
Zoe, this is Eric.

749
01:23:12,047 --> 01:23:13,969
Oh ya! Try again.

750
01:23:19,286 --> 01:23:21,205
Oh. I'm sorry Zed.

751
01:23:30,635 --> 01:23:33,249
Hey. Zed. I ought to kill you...

752
01:23:33,710 --> 01:23:36,088
It means nothing to me,
our friendship, man.

753
01:23:36,089 --> 01:23:38,469
Eric... there's no fucking
way out of here!

754
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:40,693
Oh but you're wrong, my friend.
This is my way out.

755
01:23:40,694 --> 01:23:43,596
This dime store cooch
with her motor driven ass.

756
01:23:43,597 --> 01:23:44,557
Look out for number one.

757
01:23:45,265 --> 01:23:47,414
Hey, you go find your own, man.

758
01:23:49,059 --> 01:23:50,018
Hey!

759
01:23:50,167 --> 01:23:51,922
Did you see how she ran?
Did you see how she ran?

760
01:23:52,843 --> 01:23:54,106
Did you see?

761
01:23:54,107 --> 01:23:58,327
She doesn't care about you, man.
Fucking pussy only cares about pussy.

762
01:23:59,257 --> 01:24:00,369
Huh?

763
01:24:00,614 --> 01:24:03,164
So... what do you say, Zed? Huh?

764
01:24:06,235 --> 01:24:07,641
You know what? I going to kill you.

765
01:24:07,669 --> 01:24:09,504
what do you say to that Zed?

766
01:24:10,611 --> 01:24:12,269
Fucking bitch!

767
01:24:38,287 --> 01:24:41,126
I have you balls man.

768
01:25:08,885 --> 01:25:11,164
Ox!

769
01:25:11,165 --> 01:25:13,237
Where is thy yoke!?

770
01:25:28,685 --> 01:25:30,092
Hey!

771
01:25:42,669 --> 01:25:45,290
I give you little kiss my friend.

772
01:25:46,684 --> 01:25:47,643
Ciao.

773
01:27:38,631 --> 01:27:39,991
The hospital?

774
01:27:41,925 --> 01:27:43,065
No.

775
01:27:43,934 --> 01:27:45,900
Come on. I have a car.

776
01:27:57,555 --> 01:27:59,177
I'm so tired.

777
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:01,798
We'll go to my flat.

778
01:28:03,334 --> 01:28:04,753
You can rest there.

779
01:28:08,541 --> 01:28:09,652
Do you feel pain?

780
01:28:09,909 --> 01:28:11,061
No...

781
01:28:13,481 --> 01:28:15,092
it's mostly his blood.

782
01:28:16,618 --> 01:28:18,220
I have a shower.

783
01:28:18,959 --> 01:28:20,498
You can clean up there.

784
01:28:25,124 --> 01:28:26,648
Thank you, Zoe.

785
01:28:27,739 --> 01:28:29,999
You'll get well.

786
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,764
Then I'll show you
the real Paris.

787
01:28:32,305 --> 01:29:32,753
