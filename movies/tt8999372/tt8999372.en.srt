2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,840
Okay.
Let's turn over, please.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,040
Yeah.

4
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,840
So, we're gonna
start this session with a quiz.

5
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,520
- A quiz?
- A quiz.

6
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,120
Test your memory.

7
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,800
Test... Test my memory.

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,360
- Ready?
- Right.

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,440
Okay.

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,760
On which road is the house
you were born in?

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,440
Shieldhall Road.

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,160
Correct.

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,320
What date
is your wedding anniversary?

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,240
Twelfth of March, 1966.

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,840
Who scored your
first goal as Man United manager?

16
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,360
- John Sivebaek.
- Correct.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,800
- You've got three sons.
- Yeah.

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,560
What are their dates of birth?

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,720
Well, you and your brother,
Jason and Darren,

20
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,720
are 9th of February, 1972.

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,560
And Mark is 18th September, '68.

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,840
Correct. What was the name
of the travel agent

23
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,560
you used at Aberdeen?

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,520
Harry Hynds.

25
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,000
Harry "Disaster" Hynds.

26
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,800
And what do you remember about
Saturday, 5th of May, 2018?

27
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,960
Nothing.

28
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,280
Ambulance service.
Is the patient breathing?

29
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,720
- Yes.
- Tell me exactly what's happened?

30
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,400
My dad wasn't
feeling well. He's collapsed.

31
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,080
He can't really get up.

32
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,920
So the doctor said to...

33
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,880
To phone an ambulance
straight away.

34
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,920
I am organising help
for you now.

35
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,840
Can you tell me
exactly what happened?

36
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,616
I-I don't really know.
My mom didn't see it.

37
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,120
He's not good.

38
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,480
- How old is he?
- Seventy-six.

39
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,840
What's your name please?

40
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,920
Jason.

41
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,760
- Jason?
- Yes?

42
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,240
What's his name please?

43
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,360
Alexander Ferguson.

44
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,600
You're in this dark tunnel.

45
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,240
But as you come out,
and you look to the sunshine,

46
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,560
you see...

47
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,160
more than
half the ground's United.

48
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
Memories.

49
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,200
I told them, there's a guy
there that bit me.

50
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,520
He said, well the next time,
bite him back.

51
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,120
Bite him bloody back.

52
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,960
Saying to yourself...

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,520
I'll never see this again.

54
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,440
Surely now?

55
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,560
♪ Pack up your troubles
In your old kit bag ♪

56
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,040
That was it. That was the song.

57
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,920
Bobby Charlton waved down at me.

58
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,920
Memories.

59
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,040
This is the hard knocks game.

60
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,240
I could handle it.

61
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,960
It was a lovely day.

62
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
I woke up...

63
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,560
It was pouring with rain.

64
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,976
Britain's most successful

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,120
ever football manager,
Alex Ferguson...

66
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,656
Former
Manchester United manager

67
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
is being treated for
a brain hemorrhage.

68
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,840
A very
competitive man in football,

69
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,640
but as such, a divisive figure.

70
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,440
He has achieved
unparalleled success over five decades...

71
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,760
Famous
pupils, Cristiano Ronaldo,

72
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,920
David Beckham,
"Keep fighting boss!

73
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,720
Sending prayers and love to
Cathy and the whole family."

74
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,520
We're in this side room.

75
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,400
The doctor said, "Look, Mr
Ferguson, I'm afraid to say,

76
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,296
you've had a bleed on the brain.
We're going to have to get you

77
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,080
up to Salford Royal Hospital
as soon as possible

78
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,200
for an operation."

79
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,160
And all of a sudden, he just...

80
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,840
He just put his head
in his hands and went, "Ugh!

81
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,416
I hope there's nothing
wrong with my memory.

82
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,320
There better be nothing
wrong with my memory."

83
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,200
And I was like, "Right?"

84
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,600
And then he just started
telling these random stories.

85
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,560
Where the only connection
between any of them

86
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,080
was the fact that they all
happened a long time ago.

87
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,560
I think he's telling me
these stories

88
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,480
to keep himself convinced
that he's still...

89
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,240
got a memory.

90
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,520
My mother...

91
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,280
took the big pram and I...

92
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,240
up to the local park in Glasgow.

93
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,600
And I always remember...

94
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,120
right opposite us...

95
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
was the shipyard.

96
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,600
We lived in the shadow of that.

97
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,640
You work on these ships.

98
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,320
The wind's flying down
that bloody River Clyde.

99
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,920
Oh, Jesus God.

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You feel that wind?

101
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,920
My father worked there
for over 40 years.

102
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
My dad.

103
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,080
I'll tell you
what happens, right.

104
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
That history.

105
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,880
It gets ingrained into you.

106
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Think about it.

107
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,400
Me as a manager,

108
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,960
I used to lie in bed
thinking about themes

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,560
where I could address the players
that would make an impact on them.

110
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,600
You know...
I would talk about miners,

111
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,120
shipyard workers,
welders, toolmakers.

112
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,560
You know, people who've
come from poor backgrounds.

113
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,000
And I used to ask them,

114
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,520
what did your grandfather do?

115
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,640
What did your father do?

116
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,760
But I have to get
the-the feeling inside them

117
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,960
that what their grandfathers
worked for,

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,840
and their grandmothers,
is part of them.

119
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:04,000
And they have to... they
have to display that meaning.

120
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,840
And... taking away
all the-the trophies I've won

121
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,040
and the great players I've had,

122
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,160
I think it's a thing about life.

123
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,080
It's a fact of life that where
we come from is important.

124
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,760
You come out with an identity.

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,120
I come from Govan.

126
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,480
I'm a Govan boy.

127
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,280
I loved it because it was
buzzing, you know.

128
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,920
People selling fruit in barrows.

129
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,840
All sorts of things
were going on.

130
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,400
The place was alive.

131
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,760
But, um, there was
another side to it.

132
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,680
From time to time
you would come up

133
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,680
against, uh,
guys from different areas.

134
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,640
These were really tough areas.

135
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,320
And sometimes
I had to defend my brother.

136
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
Martin.

137
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,880
Alec was always a leader.

138
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,680
Always wanted to be
the guy in front, you know.

139
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,280
Alec was always first to be in.

140
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,120
There was a boy
bullying Martin.

141
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,880
So I went up to the boy's house.

142
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,216
His father came to the door and
says, "What do you want son?"

143
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,200
I said, "I want to see your son.
He's been bullying my brother."

144
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,120
He says, "That's not my
business." And he closed the door.

145
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,160
So I got him
on the playground...

146
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,160
He was...
wee sturdy wee guy, you know?

147
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,680
And anyway,
he never bullied Martin again.

148
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,360
Everyone has
their own personality.

149
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,520
Some walk away from things.

150
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,560
Some say, "No, I'm not
going to accept this."

151
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,320
When you're growing up
in a place like Govan,

152
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,360
most people are fighting
to get out of there.

153
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,600
It's the capitalist attitude
to the working class.

154
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,640
Keep them down there.

155
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,400
Absolutely no doubt about that.

156
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,200
And I was lucky because...

157
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,400
the football was the savior.

158
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,800
Through that,
I got all the breaks.

159
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
I progressed.

160
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,480
My Dad,
he played a part in that.

161
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,160
He followed us everywhere.

162
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,760
He always encouraged us.

163
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,840
Made sure we were in bed early
the day before a game.

164
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,640
And there was clubs
starting to approach my Dad.

165
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,160
But the one I was hoping that
would go for me was Rangers.

166
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,680
I was a big Rangers fan.
Lived right behind the stadium.

167
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,680
But anyway, my dad
wouldn't let me go full-time.

168
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,800
Apprenticeship first,
and then you can go full-time.

169
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,560
He was trying to protect me in
case I didn't make it as a footballer.

170
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,240
But I don't think
it did me any harm,

171
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,360
serving my apprenticeship
as a toolmaker.

172
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,320
It helped me I think,
in understanding people.

173
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,840
The unity.

174
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,480
No establishment honor

175
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,720
can compare
with the privilege of belonging

176
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,440
to the Scottish working class.

177
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,440
My mother...

178
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,560
she was a strong,
really strong person.

179
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,640
She was a strong socialist.

180
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,600
And, uh... I was a shop
steward for the apprentices.

181
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,360
The apprentices strike, that was
a really important moment for me.

182
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,640
It was great,
being a part of it.

183
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,560
It wasn't about you,
it was about us.

184
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,720
It was about being a team.

185
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,760
Nothing more important

186
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,560
than someone
who's had hard times

187
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,080
but prepared to
not give into it.

188
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,000
But then, when I was
serving my apprenticeship...

189
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,520
I was part time at football,
at St. Johnstone.

190
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,400
I was having to travel up there,

191
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,760
three days a week.

192
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,200
That was a nightmare for me.

193
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,440
Getting home
at half one in the morning.

194
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,520
Getting up at six.

195
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,240
And then, I was getting despondent
about the football side of it,

196
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,560
because I wasn't a first team
player all the time.

197
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,800
My career
was going down the pan.

198
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,120
And I started to...

199
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,480
How would you put it?

200
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,560
I went off the rails a bit.

201
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,600
Going out in town, you know.

202

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,960

My Dad...

210
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,160
"Where are you going?" You know.

211
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,400
"I'm going out,
going to the dancing."

212
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,160
"You've got a game tomorrow.

213
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,176
You can't go to the dancing
if you've got a game tomorrow."

214
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,640
I said,
"Well, says it's the reserves,

215
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,880
and it doesn't mean a lot,
you know."

216
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,240
He says, "It means everything,
you know."

217
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,680
That's when we fell out.

218
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,400
Well, it got to a point
where he said,

219
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,240
"Go your own way,
and we'll see what happens."

220
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,040
And then we weren't
talking to one another.

221
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,080
So for two years, between
1961 and 1963, we didn't talk.

222
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,840
And then one night I went out,

223
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,000
and I got drunk.

224
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,880
And I ended up in a fight.
Ended up in jail.

225
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,880
I went to court,
I got fined three pound.

226
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,800
I was a bit of a black sheep.

227
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,400
It's always been in the
back of my head, that period.

228
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,000
And, uh,
I've always regretted that.

229
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,840
Here's me, with that sort of a
background and upbringing I had,

230
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,920
I surrendered.

231
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,200
I said to myself, I'm finished.

232
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,480
Football, it's going nowhere.

233
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,560
The immigration boom

234
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,800
touched new heights
in a novel way.

235
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,320
From Heathrow and Prestwick,
25,000 will fly to begin

236
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,760
a new life in the dominion.

237
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,240
I took out papers
to emigrate to Canada.

238
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,120
I got the forms
and all the rest of it.

239
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,240
Then that break in my life came,
you know, fate.

240
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,920
The most important game
of my life.

241
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,840
He was supposed
to play in a reserve game.

242
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,240
And he thought, "I'm not
going up to Perth. To hell with it."

243
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,640
I got my brother's girlfriend

244
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,240
to phone the manager,
tell him I had the flu.

245
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,520
Kidding on
that she was my mother

246
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,520
And I got home about seven.

247
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,120
And my mother's going
absolutely berserk with me.

248
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,680
'Cause what had happened,
the manager had sent her

249
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,640
a telegram that says, "I know
that wasn't you that phoned me."

250
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,800
And she says, "You get along
to that man right now."

251
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,160
And you'd better phone him, and
you'd better be apologising to him.

252
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,000
And I've got the handkerchief
over the phone.

253
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,600
Pretending I've got a bad cold.

254
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,440
He says, "You'd better report
tomorrow at the Buchanan Street Hotel.

255
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,560
You're playing tomorrow
against Rangers."

256
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,360
So, I go to the game.

257
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,160
And I scored a hat-trick.

258
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,080
Unbelievable, eh?

259
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,920
He was the first person
to score a hat-trick at Ibrox.

260
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,360
Nobody had ever done it before.

261
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,440
I did... I wanted to go home
and see my dad.

262
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,240
You know what I mean.

263
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,280
I wanted to go home because I
knew he'd be proud as peacock, and...

264
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,320
And my mother,
she's all excited and she says,

265
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,240
"Go on, talk to him."

266
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,600
"What do you think, Dad?"

267
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,760
"All right, yeah, it was okay.
Yeah."

268
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,360
And then he starts.
"That's the boy I had.

269
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,640
That's the... shoot on sight."

270
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,840
We're back, we're back pals.

271
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,640
That changed my life.

272
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,080
Seriously that... it was
the biggest break of my life.

273
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,360
And I say that to people often now,
I say, "Don't miss a big opportunity."

274
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,520
You know, you might
only get one in your life.

275
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,040
And that was my one in life.

276
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,080
That was the one
that mattered to me.

277
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,240
And I made a vow,
that moment on,

278
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,000
that I was not looking back.

279
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,600
I was committed.
That was it. I was committed.

280
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,400
Nothing but football for me.

281
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,400
The brain controls everything.

282
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,480
Your experience is all stored
in your brain, in your memories.

283
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,320
And by that I think you make up
your-your identity as a person.

284
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,320
Childhood, adolescence,

285
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,360
the memories make Alex Ferguson
him as him.

286
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,000
I remember falling. That's all.

287
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,160
After that,
I don't remember a thing.

288
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,880
I just sudden... stopped.

289
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,160
I just stopped.
I was in no... no-man's-land.

290
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,680
So I remember
estimating his mortality

291
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,160
at that point in time
as 80 percent.

292
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,680
As in, there was an 80 percent
chance he would not survive.

293
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,056
And then,
the doctor came and said,

294
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,360
"Look, we're about to
take him down

295
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,440
for the operation."

296
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,720
Two people can go in and see him

297
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,000
before he gets operated on.

298
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,040
So I said, look,
I'll take my mom in.

299
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,160
And it was a shock.
My mom was, "Whoa!"

300
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,640
There was wires everywhere
and all the rest of it.

301
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,320
And then, that-that was hard.
I felt it then, really.

302
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,080
Um... Sorry.

303
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,520
So...

304
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,920
As we opened the
head, we found a large clot.

305
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,800
But if you
cut off the blood vessel,

306
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,320
then that part
of the brain dies.

307
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,840
So, sometimes you
just apply pressure and wait.

308
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,720
And so, I do remember waiting,
and waiting.

309
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,720
And after a while,
the bleeding stopped.

310
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,760
The brain started resurfacing,

311
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,120
which I thought was a good sign.

312
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,680
I think that day there was
five brain hemorrhages.

313
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,520
That day I was... and three died.

314
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,680
Only two survived,
I was one of them.

315
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,200
So, you know,
you know you're lucky.

316
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,440
It was beautiful weather.
I always remember that.

317
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,936
And you're looking out the
hospital window, and you're...

318
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,960
and you're saying,
I wonder if I'll ever see...

319
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,880
How many sunny days
I'm ever going to see again?

320
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,600
You know?
And I found that difficult.

321
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,520
He was upset
even when I went in.

322
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,400
And I says to him, if you don't
calm down, I'll need to go.

323
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,400
Because if I'm upsetting you
as well, you have to keep calm,

324
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,640
you know, especially,
for the next 24 hours.

325
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,680
I was 22.

326
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,360
I had this friend,
um, she says to me,

327
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,960
"There's a really nice girl,
just started."

328
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,640
I just saw him walking through.

329
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,720
I'd suffered an injury at football
and I had a plaster on my face.

330
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,160
She thought I was either a
gangster or a boxer.

331
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,840
I thought he was a thug.

332
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,000
Then I found out
that he was a footballer.

333
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,760
But that didn't make... didn't make
him any different to me.

334
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,680
I took her to the movies.

335
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,040
Bought me a box
of Liquorice Allsorts,

336
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,600
which he ate all of them.

337
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,280
And a local paper
when we come out.

338
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,920
That was my romantic date.

339
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,320
We got really close.
And, you know, I really loved her.

340
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,240
But, you know, she was Catholic.

341
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:17,120
And my mother's Catholic
and my father was Protestant.

342
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,920
But we were
brought up Protestants.

343
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,920
Well, we're different religions.

344
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,600
It did cause problems.

345
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,960
That's the way it was then,
you know.

346
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,040
Glasgow...

347
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,680
is a city
where there's a divide.

348
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,640
There's Protestant, Catholic.

349
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,360
It's Rangers and Celtic.

350
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,720
The Old
Firm, Celtic and Rangers.

351
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,040
They've been battling now
for 75 years.

352
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,560
The battle is not between
a team and a team.

353
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,560
It's between the Prods
and the Papes.

354
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,640
Between Protestant and Catholic.

355
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,000
So we just said
we'd have a civil wedding.

356
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,360
We got married in 1966.

357
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,920
Glasgow Registry Office.

358
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,280
That was the start.

359
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,920
I went to my work.
He went to his football.

360
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,320
And I really did well.

361
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,640
Yes, it's a goal by Ferguson.

362
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,200
I was rumbustious, aggressive.

363
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,120
Ferguson! And it's a goal!

364
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,280
I could score goals, you know.

365
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,440
Ferguson!

366
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,200
And that was... when I heard
that Rangers wanted to sign me.

367
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,440
And of course, having supported
Rangers as a boy,

368
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,000
and lived, what,
200 yards from the ground.

369
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,040
I was pretty excited about that.

370
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,840
I get in my best suit,
and go across to Ibrox.

371
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,400
It was unbelievable.

372
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,240
This big marble hall,
you know, it's quite impressive.

373
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,000
It was absolutely fantastic.

374
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,480
Govan boy signing for Rangers.

375
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,080
Scottish transfer record.

376
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,200
♪ The wheel of fortune

377
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,280
It was his boyhood dream
come true.

378
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,320
Ferguson's there!
It's a goal by Ferguson!

379
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,200
♪ Will the arrow
Point my way? ♪

380
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,880
Ferguson scores!

381
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,760
On towards Ferguson.

382
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,200
A good goal by Ferguson! Alex
Ferguson's done what he's tried so hard...

383
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,520
Anyway,
my first season was over...

384
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,160
and we'd lost the league
in the last gasp to Celtic.

385
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,360
Celtic have again
proved themselves Scotland's top team.

386
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,320
If you don't beat Celtic,
it's not a good season.

387
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,320
And, uh, certain people
had the knife in Alec,

388
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,320
for obvious reasons, you know.

389
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,760
Cathy was Catholic.

390
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,960
When I signed for Rangers,

391
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,640
one of the directors,
he asked me about Cathy.

392
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,720
And he says, um,

393
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,000
I have to ask you a question
about your wife.

394
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,440
Uh, I believe she's Catholic.
I says, "Yeah."

395
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,080
He says,
"Were you married in a chapel?"

396
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,160
I says, "No, we got married
in a registry office."

397
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,400
He says, "Oh, that's okay."

398
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,320
Uh, you know, I should've
told him to fuck off.

399
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,680
You know, I really should have.

400
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,160
But having supported Rangers
as a boy,

401
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,720
and having an opportunity
to go and play for Rangers,

402
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,560
you're prepared
to take nonsense.

403
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,640
You know what I mean?

404
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,880
I was... I let myself down there.

405
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,000
And I let my wife down. And that
was, uh, was the important thing.

406
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,760
'Cause she was
a devout Catholic.

407
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,840
No, I don't...
My memories of...

408
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,440
With Rangers weren't
very happy anyway, you know.

409
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,120
It was a bad time for us.

410
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,120
And then, we got
the Cup Final against Celtic.

411
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,960
Everybody's screaming.

412
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,240
A hundred and thirty-two
thousand people.

413
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,480
And there I was,

414
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,880
playing number nine for Rangers.

415
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,960
Ferguson about to kick off.

416
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,280
In this, the Scottish Cup Final
here at Hampden Park.

417
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,280
But, as it turned out,
it wasn't about football.

418
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,600
It was...

419
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,960
It was a...

420
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,520
Well, there was
a price to pay for me.

421
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,440
And it looks like
a corner forced there.

422
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,920
And the thing here is that,
Billy McNeill,

423
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,880
the giant-sized center half
of Celtic normally comes up.

424
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,000
McNeill...

425
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,240
And he's done it,
and scored a goal!

426
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,920
McNeill comes up there for one
of his traditionally famous headers.

427
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,920
Ferguson should've been
ready for that one.

428
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,920
Ferguson let it go,
and paid the penalty.

429
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,480
Oh, God. What a start.

430
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,720
Oh! Bad pass back there.

431
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,800
Bad pass back and it puts
Lennox in the clear,

432
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,400
straight in he can go.
He's very fast, is Lennox.

433
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,520
Scoring chance. And it's there!

434
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,520
Celtic takes a two-nothing
lead over Rangers.

435
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,040
Greig. And here's a terrible
mistake there by John Greig!

436
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,200
Three-nothing for Celtic.

437
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,560
Chalmers breaking.

438
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,160
I was part of the team
that got slaughtered.

439
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,720
No one enjoys that.

440
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,880
And, of course,
Alec got the blame of it.

441
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:22,560
They were looking for a
scapegoat, and Alec became the scapegoat.

442
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,880
After that, it was like
a witch-hunt, you know.

443
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,080
It was my last game.
I never played again.

444
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,360
So, I was completely bombed out.

445
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,080
Trained on my own.

446
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,160
I can only assume it was
because of Cathy being a Catholic.

447
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,440
I'm sure of it.

448
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,080
Eventually, I left.

449
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,760
And I went
down-down the scale to Falkirk.

450
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,520
Went down that, uh,
slope a bit, you know.

451
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,880
Oh, I... Oh, I mean, he was
upset, you know, obviously.

452
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,960
And I think a bit angry,
you know.

453
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,640
But it made him
determined as well, you know.

454
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,920
He was determined that he
would go on and prove his self.

455
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,520
The thing that drove me
most was leaving Rangers.

456
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,000
That spurred me.

457
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:28,040
I was starting to question
the managers.

458
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,120
You know, their way of managing.

459
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,440
That gave me that... How was it?

460
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,200
That impetus about saying,
"I can do this job.

461
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,640
I know I can do this job."

462
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,640
See, because that's
my upbringing.

463
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,080
Don't give in.

464
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,960
He initially
recovered very well.

465
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,600
But he was still in
a certain level of danger here.

466
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,680
There was a day when,
uh, everybody came in.

467
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,360
There was about 14 people
in my room,

468
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,880
and, uh, that was too much,
you know.

469
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,120
His mind was trying to
keep up with everybody,

470
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,960
so he was doing too much
with the brain.

471
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,720
And then, he had a lapse.
Uh, quite a-a bad lapse.

472
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,760
My voice stopped.

473
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,600
Trying to get the...

474
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,600
And, you know, you're trying to
force it out and you can't get out.

475
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,760
When the doctors came in and
I was crying, you know, 'cause...

476
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,960
you felt helpless.

477
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,520
He was really upset with that

478
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,256
because he thought
he was going to lose his voice,

479
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,760
going to lose his memory.

480
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,640
I would have hated
if I'd have lost my memory.

481
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:01,240
It would've been a terrible
burden on-on the family.

482
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,200
I'm sitting in the house,
and I don't know who I am,

483
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,320
I don't know who you are
or who my wife is.

484
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,520
In many ways, that would've been
the worst thing that could've happened.

485
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,840
Surviving,
but losing the memory.

486
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,360
Two of the doctors came in
and they just said, "Write."

487
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,680
You know, gave me a pen, write
names. Write your family's name.

488
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,640
Write your friend's name.
Write your football team's names.

489
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,600
Write your players names.

490
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,880
And I just kept writing,
and writing, and writing.

491
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,760
And I'm thinking, "He's writing
quite a long time here".

492
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,376
And I went, "Right, okay.
Let's have a look".

493
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,680
So I took the book off him,
and he's like that.

494
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,680
He was like a little boy,
really, to be honest.

495
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,200
Aye.

496
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,680
It's impossible to read this.

497
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,840
"The remember that, remember
that, that had remember...

498
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,720
the remember, that remember,
that has had remember."

499
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,600
I've repeated the word
"remember" three times there.

500
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,360
Yeah.

501
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,120
God.

502
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,400
Regarding my health,
I'm not actually in control,

503
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,720
in the football world...
and at-at United,

504
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm in control of the situation.

505
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,120
It's vital.

506
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,960
Because... a player
can't do it himself.

507
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,920
A player's only part of a team.

508
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,680
The manager's
in control of that.

509
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,360
He's in control
of all that destiny.

510
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,600
Dealing with the press,

511
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,000
with referees,

512
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,080
with rivals.

513
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,080
I've got to make decisions
that are correct.

514
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,520
You have to make
really difficult decisions.

515
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,040
I'm telling you,
I was never afraid of that.

516
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,320
I never looked back.

517
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,760
I never looked back because
there was always tomorrow

518
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,800
as far as I was concerned,
whether you lose or win.

519
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,280
There was always tomorrow.

520
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:26,480
But, now, if you remember,
we spoke about reflecting.

521
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,760
Um, I've done a lot of reflecting
on things, uh, that I achieved

522
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,760
and what I didn't achieve,
and I think that's been,

523
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,280
has been quite a challenge,
actually.

524
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,840
Because you're-you're
searching your memory.

525
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,840
And that's what I've had to do.

526
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,480
Aberdeen.

527
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,880
The Granite City.

528
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,320
The silver city by the sea.

529
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,520
I'd been part-time manager

530
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,240
for three and a half years
at St. Mirren.

531
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,680
I was offered the job to be
full-time manager at Aberdeen.

532
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,000
I snapped at it.

533
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:24,560
And, uh, I had my own
philosophy about management.

534
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,000
Hold it there.
Come on, big man Dougie.

535
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,840
Get that thigh on the chest.

536
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,040
- Hold it.
- Don't move.

537
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,440
Feel the back of your legs.

538
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,480
Hold it for a wee bit.

539
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,840
Obviously, I've got
my own ideas and standards.

540
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,360
And through time, this'll
come through to the players.

541
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,720
Fingers crossed.

542
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,040
When he first got there...

543
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,880
Well, we're at the level where
Aberdeen had been for years.

544
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,280
Where you... The fans are quite happy
if you won a trophy every six years.

545
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,320
And that trophy was either
the League Cup or the F.A. Cup.

546
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,960
That was success.

547
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,880
We were a group of guys,

548
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,400
play football
just to make a living.

549
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,240
But the problem was,

550
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,440
a lot of those players couldn't
dream of winning a league.

551
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,920
And incredible as it may seem,

552
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,280
we didn't have
a training ground at Aberdeen.

553
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,640
Facilities?
There's a park along from us

554
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,576
That wasn't that great
because you had to

555
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,320
kick off the dog crap, uh,

556
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,760
before you started training.

557
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,840
Yeah, the car park was used
mainly in the afternoons.

558
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,120
We used to go to the beach.

559
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,160
And we'd only stop when
the actual tide hit a goalpost.

560
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,080
But the only thing that mattered
was beating Rangers and Celtic.

561
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,720
If you don't beat Rangers and
Celtic, you don't win the league.

562
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,120
Simple as that.

563
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,760
I remember, he was desperate.

564
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,960
I mean, desperate to beat the
two sides, the Old Firm sides.

565
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,760
Rangers, I felt in particular
more than Celtic.

566
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,600
For some reason,
I don't know what it was.

567
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,560
But Rangers
was the first target.

568
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,560
The first time
we played at Rangers...

569
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,240
and we scrambled a draw
in the last minute.

570
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,320
After the game, the players were
all celebrating, jumping up and down.

571
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,120
And I'm, what,
I'm saying, "Wait a minute".

572
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:50,000
I says, "What are you celebrating?
I mean... you've only drawn."

573
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,200
And we'd all had kind of...
rollockings or bollockings,

574
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,336
whatever you want to call it,
before at different clubs.

575
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,160
But this was an intensity

576
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,120
that was not about
just that game or something.

577
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,560
It was... everything.

578
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,040
Where you want to go, what
you want to do with your life.

579
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,120
Forget all the work
we'd been doing,

580
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,760
with passing the ball and
technical ability, etcetera, etcetera.

581
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,840
If they're not winners,
it's a waste of time anyway.

582
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,400
You're trying to
get that character

583
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,040
instilled in the human beings
you're dealing with.

584
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,840
When they go on that pitch,
they can't leave

585
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,800
their personality
in the dressing room.

586
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,800
When I looked at that,
I thought there's-there's

587
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,560
something up here.

588
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,440
Somehow there's something
inside this fellow...

589
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,280
that's making him angry
and driving him.

590
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,160
Well, looking back on it now,

591
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,480
it looks like I bumped into
a-a wounded animal here.

592
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,920
Look, rather than explain

593
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,120
how you can bring-bring
a winning mentality to people,

594
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,520
I think you've got to produce
a project that's working.

595
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,640
Technique, mentally,
physically, the whole lot.

596
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,080
He put
people under so much pressure

597
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,040
to be successful.

598
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,560
You have to earn the right

599
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,080
to be an Aberdeen player

600
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,040
that I was looking for.

601
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,960
The coaching
and the speed of their play,

602
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,720
the concentration...

603
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,920
If you're
doing these things right,

604
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,520
it definitely develops
their mind better.

605
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,440
Deep down inside us there's
a devil that drives you on.

606
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,360
Um, for whatever reason,

607
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,800
he could make that devil
materialise for a game of football.

608
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,640
McMaster through to Harper.

609
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,160
Harper's left foot out in front.

610
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,480
It's going to be a goal!

611
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,120
Yes, it's over! It's a goal!

612
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,440
And, sensationally,
Aberdeen lead one-nil.

613
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,200
It was really a turning point

614
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,776
because the players
are now saying to themselves,

615
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,320
"Right, let's get after Celtic."

616
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,680
That's the one
we were after now.

617
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,496
Archibald and
a chance, and he scores!

618
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,600
Archibald scores!

619
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,840
There's a cross
aimed for Archibald.

620
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,840
Latchford drops it,
Strachan scores.

621
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,640
Strachan makes it three-one.

622
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,760
Yeah. He-he brought
the devil out in me.

623
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,760
You think, "Oh, we're in here."
That was the hardest bit.

624
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,920
Because, um... Sir Alex had
never won that league before.

625
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,360
None of us had won that league
before. So, it was all new to us.

626
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,160
And how we dealt with it.

627
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,680
And at that point, the manager
was the most important guy,

628
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:54,240
'cause we were looking at him
for guidance how to get through it.

629
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,360
Now, having beaten Celtic
twice in the past month,

630
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,080
is it all about conviction?

631
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,936
Believing in yourselves
that you-you can actually do it?

632
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,480
Because I've met infinite number
of Aberdonians who say,

633
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,120
"Ah, yes. They're a good team,
but they haven't won anything yet."

634
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,520
Conviction and belief
is built up in-in time.

635
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,680
Uh...

636
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:18,600
Mainly with the work that I do
myself with the players in, you know,

637
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,960
on their character and their discipline,
and having belief in themselves

638
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,080
and conviction in going to
places like Celtic Park and Ibrox,

639
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,400
and believing they can win.

640
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,000
Oh, that's a goal!

641
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,560
Steve Archibald!

642
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,800
Scanlon... Yes!

643
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,360
What a marvelous goal
to finish this match!

644
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,440
And that's it! They have won!

645
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,080
Alec Ferguson is on now
in the penalty area!

646
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,120
Aberdeen have definitely won
the Championship!

647
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,440
Alec Ferguson,
can you blame the man

648
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,080
for going out of his mind
temporarily?

649
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,800
- Yeah!
- All right.

650
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:18,920
So, I'd been looking
for an assistant for a while.

651
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,480
It couldn't have been better for
me. That's what I wanted to do.

652
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,160
That's what I enjoyed doing,
uh, the most so, uh,

653
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,440
it was perfect for me.

654
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,920
Oh, it was a nightmare,
the two of them.

655
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,640
Um, and it was...
It was like most managers

656
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,400
have bad cop, good cop.

657
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,680
Well, it used to be Sir Alex,
bad cop.

658
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,240
Worse cop...
with Archie.

659
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,080
After a couple of weeks,
the players...

660
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,896
The players must've been
saying to themselves,

661
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,080
"Jesus Christ.
There's two of them."

662
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,520
You were steeped in the thing,
football-wise.

663
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,080
I was steeped in it.

664
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,040
He never had
much of a home life.

665
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,160
He never saw the kids much.

666
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,120
That was his job.

667
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,040
Well, he got on with his job,
and I got on with the kids.

668
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:17,240
Cathy brought the kids up. And
I'm not... I'm not proud of that.

669
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,640
Five past three
on Friday afternoon,

670
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,880
and Aberdeen leave Pittodrie
for the drive south.

671
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,200
He was never there, so you see,

672
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,320
you always thought
he's-he's always at work.

673
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,640
But, um, and he was.
I mean, he's a workaholic.

674
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,000
I regret not having spent
more time with you,

675
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,440
but that was the nature
of my job.

676
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,800
It's consuming in terms
of how it can get inside you.

677
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,200
But we got a reward for that.

678
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,616
Well, the European flag.

679
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,800
The UEFA flag
flying over Pittodrie!

680
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,120
Bayern Munich versus Aberdeen.

681
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,480
Well, let's put it this way,
right?

682
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,120
Aberdeen and Bayern.

683
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,880
Bayern have got 70,000
in their stadium.

684
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,600
Aberdeen had 20, right?

685
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,400
Augenthaler,
looking for a chance to shoot.

686
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,080
And that's the moment
that Aberdeen were dreading.

687
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:15,720
When I look back at it
now, our training, the intensity,

688
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,040
he was testing us.

689
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,296
That's a great cross.

690
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,800
Eric Black is there!

691
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,320
It's off the line. No!
It's put in by Simpson!

692
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,960
And Aberdeen are level.

693
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,296
He didn't want
anybody next to him

694
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,240
that he knew would

695
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,240
let him or the team down...

696
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,880
in a crisis moment.

697
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,360
And that is a special goal,

698
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,720
which might well end
Aberdeen's challenge in Europe.

699
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,880
At two-one,
there was a crisis moment.

700
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,480
We needed two goals.

701
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,480
The header finds the net!

702
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,600
Can they make it?

703
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,040
There's Eric Black!

704
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,920
The goalkeeper knocks it out.

705
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,960
It's in the net,
and Aberdeen are in front!

706
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,600
Pittodrie goes berserk.

707
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,200
Well, that score line

708
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,000
is almost impossible to believe.

709
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:17,000
The final whistle goes, Aberdeen have
won, perhaps, their greatest victory ever!

710
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,640
Alec Ferguson dancing a jig of
delight on the track, and well he might.

711
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,840
That game was monumental to me.

712
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,120
I mean, God Almighty.

713
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,680
Real Madrid, in the
final of a European tournament.

714
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:54,120
Real Madrid are the most
successful club in the world.

715
00:46:54,160 --> 00:47:00,040
For a small club in a small
town, this had made their lives.

716
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,320
Thousands
of Don's fans are travelling

717
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,080
to support their heroes'
first European final.

718
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,480
Light refreshments

719
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,040
were already
being served in the bar

720
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,160
and proving so popular
that reinforcements

721
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,640
were being brought in
by the trolley load.

722
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,096
What are you going to do
after the match?

723
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,840
Get drunk.

724
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,520
Celebrate.

725
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,856
- What happens if we lose?
- Still get drunk.

The pride of Scottish football,

754
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,000
Aberdeen,
received a huge welcome

755
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,320
as they returned home bearing
the European Cup, Winner's Cup.

756
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,816
Britain's most
northerly professional football club

757
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,120
has never seen
anything like this.

758
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,720
The greyness of the
Granite City was transformed.

759
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,096
The amazing response
has been from managers

760
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,680
and-and directors in England.

761
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,320
- In England?
- Yes.

762
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,360
Well, we have one here
from Bob Paisley of Liverpool,

763
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,760
which is marvelous, you know.

764
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,760
"Congratulations,
you've done us proud."

765
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,760
How difficult is it
to adjust to another cup final?

766
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,480
Well, it's just got
down to this stage now

767
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,640
that we don't want to
disappoint anyone.

768
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,336
Well, in fact,
the very last game you played

769
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,440
for Rangers was in
the Cup Final, was it not?

770
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,800
The last game of the year,
the Cup Final against Rangers,

771
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,600
is as good a time as any to demonstrate
who's the best team in Scotland.

772
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,920
That's a good ball.
McGhee likes his position.

773
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,840
It could be there. It is!

774
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,360
The winner!
That will win the Cup.

775
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,960
There's Alec Ferguson.

776
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,080
Okay. Alec Ferguson, many
congratulations winning the Scottish Cup

777
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,840
for the second year,
but it was close.

778
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,440
Were you surprised by the way...

779
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,520
Can you give a reason for
the disappointing performance, then?

780
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,160
I can't understand
why I did it.

781
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,480
The only thing I can
think of was that...

782
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:30,560
I wanted this to be the moment,
when we...

783
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,200
we set ourselves as the
best team Scotland ever had.

784
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:45,800
In all honesty, was it about
being the best team in Scotland?

785
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,640
Or was it about
hammering Rangers?

786
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,120
I think it was, probably,
about beating Rangers.

787
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:01,160
This was my moment to say,
"Right, you're gonna get it."

788
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,680
I wanted to
put the knife in them.

789
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,560
I think it was that, really.

790
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:31,640
I think that my dad...

791
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,800
was pointing at a totally
different target to-to other people.

792
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,480
I think he was already thinking,

793
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:48,120
"Look, my horizons
are beyond Aberdeen."

794
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,120
Beyond Rangers, beyond Scotland.

795
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,440
"I've beaten these guys. I've
totally different aspirations now."

796
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,400
My dad's an optimist.

797
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,200
He's an absolute clear optimist.

798
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,600
And so, you know,
he's willing to dream big.

799
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,320
Manchester
United sacked their manager,

800
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,920
Ron Atkinson today.

801
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,096
And the man
who's going to replace him

802
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,040
is Aberdeen's Alex Ferguson.

803
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,440
1986 has been United's

804
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,640
worst start to the season
since the war.

805
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,936
The camera
shutters and the microphones strained

806
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,240
at the first appearance
of the new boss.

807
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,816
Manchester
United is the most famous name

808
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,480
in English football.
There's no bigger news.

809
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,160
If there is a man,
is he the man to follow you?

810
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,136
Yes, I'd have to be honest.
If I'd have been the chairman

811
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,520
and I'd have got rid of somebody
like me, I'd have taken him.

812
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:49,280
Moving across the border
was, you know, going to the moon.

813
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:54,200
And I wasn't... I wasn't happy
because I didn't want to leave Aberdeen.

814
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,440
But I knew there was no way
he would refuse that job.

815
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,160
We've brought Alec
down from Scotland this morning.

816
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,600
Perhaps, we'd like to go
straight into the questions.

817
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,360
You've come here
with the club 19th in the First Division.

818
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,880
We need to look at
the facts for themselves.

819
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:19,120
We haven't won the League
for 20 years, right?

820
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,000
That is a great challenge for
the Manchester United players,

821
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,800
and will be until it's achieved.

822
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:28,200
And the only way we can win the
European Cup is by winning the League.

823
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,960
Because that's the great desire.

824
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,160
And my first day there,

825
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,280
I went to Old Trafford.

826
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,560
Even though
it was an empty stadium,

827
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,440
you can feel
the spirit of the place.

828
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,040
It's like a theatre
with ghosts walking about it.

829
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,720
Memories.

830
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,200
Matt Busby,
the maestro of Manchester United...

831
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,400
This is the place
where they've created...

832
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,240
Gods.

833
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,616
The manager, Matt
Busby, transformed the whole approach

834
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,440
to modern day football with
his commitment to a youth policy.

835
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,000
I have a scouting system
whose sole object is to go out

836
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,520
looking for young,
promising school boys,

837
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,320
youth club boys,
and indeed, any young players.

838
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:35,120
Manchester United
were supreme soccer champions of Europe!

839
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,480
Matt Busby doing what he did

840
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,040
to bring all these young
players into your first team,

841
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,520
this is what I believed in.
This is what I was good at.

842
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,960
This is what I wanted to do.

843
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,360
So, it was question time.

844
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,560
What do I really need
to resurrect the club?

845
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,560
One way of doing it
was the proper youth system.

846
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,760
That can be the spirit
of the place.

847
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,440
The new spirit.

848
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,960
I had a meeting with Brian
Whitehouse who was the reserve coach.

849
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,520
And a meeting
with Eric Harrison.

850
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,360
And they were
Ron Atkinson's men, of course.

851
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,800
They had a youth game. I think
it was second or third week there.

852
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:28,120
They were shocking Jason,
they were shocking.

853
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,560
I went in after the dressing
room, I couldn't stand it.

854
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,200
And I went berserk with them.

855
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,280
And I knew Eric was not pleased.
Eric was not pleased.

856
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,360
And he came to see me
the next day.

857
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,200
He says, "Look, that's my job.

858
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,080
I've never known a manager
to come in."

859
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,840
And I says, "Yeah, but you've
never known a manager like me."

860
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,800
The first thing he did, was we
got all the scouts together.

861
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,920
I'd only two scouts
in Manchester.

862
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,040
And he says, "We need to do
something about that."

863
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,480
So my job was to...

864
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:04,880
flood Manchester with scouts.

865
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:09,080
So as he could have his way
of building a football club,

866
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,560
from the bottom up.

867
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,320
We had to make a mark
on Manchester itself.

868
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:28,880
It was only a few weeks after I
arrived, and, um, there was a steward.

869
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,960
Says,
"Boss, there's a young lad."

870
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
He's training with Man City,
he's a United fan.

871
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,800
He's an absolutely
fantastic player,

872
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,840
"and we're doing nothing
about it."

873
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,120
So I went to see him.

874
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,800
I did notice him
while I was playing.

875
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:55,640
"The Man United manager,
what's going on there?"

876
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,920
It just doesn't happen.
It just doesn't happen.

877
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,520
You see him
dancing over the pitch.

878
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,560
You know...

879
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,160
Sensational.

880
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,880
Feet, very narrow.
Balance, fantastic.

881
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:15,760
We got him signed.

882
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,600
He was a breath of fresh air,
he really was.

883
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,840
So... he was the future.

884
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,200
But putting that aside,

885
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,880
you need results
in your first team.

886
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,600
But I knew that.

887
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:41,160
When you look round that squad,
it was just a dysfunctional unit.

888
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,120
"Fifth of March, 1988.

889
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:59,160
Lost 1-0 at Norwich.
Absolutely shocking display."

890
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,800
Manchester
United conspicuous by their absence.

891
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:07,280
"Sunday, had the players
in for a talk."

892
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,136
Manchester
United have won nothing since '85.

893
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,560
It's not good enough.

894
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,040
"Lost 1-0 to Liverpool.

895
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,880
Shocker of a game."

896
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,160
Alec Ferguson,
his team in severe problems.

897
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:23,640
"Lost 2-1.
Team is lacking confidence."

898
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,680
Did it affect
your confidence at all?

899
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,320
Lack of success
affects everyone's confidence.

900
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,416
Did you know the pressures
were going to be quite as great

901
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,960
when you left Scotland?

902
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,640
No. No. I didn't...
I didn't realise that.

903
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:39,080
"Lost two-nil to
Southampton. Totally disgusting."

904
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,240
A beleaguered manager.

905
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,840
"Sunday. Frustrated."

906
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,600
"Saturday, 23rd of
September. V Man City."

907
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,720
United
all over the place! Morley!

908
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,280
"Lost 5-1."

909
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:18,400
Alex Ferguson won three
championships with Aberdeen in Scotland.

910
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,560
But he's finding it
a far more difficult prize

911
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,200
to get his hands on
south of the border.

912
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,120
I remember after the game...

913
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,360
I got home.

914
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,760
I just stayed in my bed,
you know?

915
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,280
Probably the best place to be.

916
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,400
I'd been there
for over three years,

917
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,800
and that's when the cries
were coming out, you know?

918
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,280
Fergie out.

919
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,720
Fergie out! Fergie out!

920
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,000
Fergie out!
Fergie out! Fergie out!

921
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,720
We got calls into the house.
I remember that, yeah. I do.

922
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,360
You know, "Go back to
fucking Scotland," and all that.

923
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,640
"You're fucking useless."

924
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,280
I would just
put the phone down, you know.

925
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,840
And Cathy
got a bit upset with it.

926
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,600
You were getting
abusive phone calls.

927
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,480
I found that really hard.

928
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:35,320
It would have just been like
a tightening of a screw on her.

929
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,640
It was just
an instrument of torture.

930
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,920
I got sort of a, paranoid.

931
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,680
The magpies drove me crazy.

932
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:47,840
One for sorrow, two for joy, so if
you only saw one before a game,

933
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:51,760
I mean I-I used to be looking
for the other.

934
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,760
I went to him,
and so did my brothers,

935
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,440
and I just said,
"Dad, it's not working.

936
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,360
You're not going to
be able to succeed here.

937
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,096
You know, it's-it's...
You know, it's killing us,

938
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,896
and I just don't think
you're going to be successful."

939
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:04,560
And for his eldest son
to have basically gone and said,

940
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,280
"We don't believe in you. You're
going to fail. You need to give up,"

941
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:10,040
which is not quite what I said,
but it's what I meant.

942
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:13,480
And he said, "I really think I can
succeed here. I really think we're close."

943
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:17,200
And I was like, "Oh, deluded.
What are you thinking?"

944
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:26,000
"January 1st, good luck!
F.A. Cup."

945
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,576
For
Manchester United, Sunday's match

946
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,680
at Nottingham Forest
has been looming.

947
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,296
United are going to Forest

948
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,640
currently fifth bottom
of the First Division.

949
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,920
It's being
billed as Alex Ferguson's last stand.

950
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,480
His Alamo.

951
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:39,960
The day before,

952
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,480
Martin Edwards, the chairman,

953
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,600
called me up to his office.

954
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:46,920
And he says, "Doesn't matter
what happens on Sunday,

955
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,720
you'll still be the manager,
I can assure you of that."

956
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,600
And that was good of him
to do that.

957
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:58,040
Now, that's not to say,
that was cast in stone, that.

958
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:01,000
Because if the crowds
had gone down,

959
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:06,400
and we end up at the bottom
of the league, you're away.

960
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:09,920
I could half agree with the club if
they said, "Well, we've had enough."

961
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:17,440
Alec Ferguson, who
celebrated his 48th birthday last week.

962
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:20,920
And I suspect in the last seven
weeks, he's aged a bit more than that.

963
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:27,600
OÖrlygsson, kept in by Martin.

964
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,040
Hughes, he's got a lot of room.

965
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,280
And here's Robins!

966
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,960
United are through!

967
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,520
Some joy at last
for Alec Ferguson.

968
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:47,320
There's a smile on the face
of the United manager.

969
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:52,360
After so many problems, at least,
they've won this crunch-match.

970
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,080
That was a pivotal game.

971
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,960
And of course, we were
struggling in the league.

972
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,040
But now the F.A. Cup
was keeping us alive, you know.

973
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:05,720
Yes!
Manchester United are at Wembley.

974
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,080
We got to
the-the Cup Final.

975
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:17,640
But I had a
big problem in my mind.

976
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,280
Jim Leighton.

977
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,840
Jim was having a horrid time.

978
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,520
Long range shot...

979
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,360
Oh! A mistake
there by Jim Leighton.

980
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,960
Jim...

981
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,040
I gave him
his debut at Aberdeen.

982
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,320
I brought him to United.

983
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:45,120
Alex Ferguson
said he is the best goalkeeper in Britain.

984
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,800
At Aberdeen...
did well for me.

985
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:54,560
And once
again, Leighton is Aberdeen's hero!

986
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:58,960
Fantastic goalkeeper, Jim.
Top, top goalkeeper.

987
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,456
The fact that I'm supposed to
be the best goalkeeper in Scotland,

988
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,320
you get a lot more respect.
Plus, the confidence has done me

989
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,040
an awful lot of good as well.

990
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:08,200
But now...

991
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:13,320
He didn't seem to have the same
confidence about himself.

992
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,640
There's the man. Alex Ferguson.

993
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,216
Free kick to Crystal Palace.

994
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:31,040
Andy Gray's back
on his feet to take it.

995
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,240
Thorn, O'Reilly's in there!

996
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,600
And was it over the line?

997
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,640
And it's a goal!

998
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,480
He was making mistake
after mistake.

999
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:47,000
Wright! Goal!

1000
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,536
And the referee has blown,

1001
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:55,880
and the F.A. Cup Final of 1990
ends in a draw.

1002
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,256
And they'll have to come back

1003
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,760
and do it all again on Thursday.

1004
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,240
But after the game,
Jim's like that.

1005
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,520
Head was right down, right down.

1006
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,320
It got to that point
that you say to yourself,

1007
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:15,280
"I have to pick a team
that's going to win the Cup."

1008
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:18,080
I don't think Jim's
part of my thinking in that.

1009
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,120
So, we had a wee bit
of an argument about that.

1010
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,680
He would've played him again,
Archie. He would've.

1011
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,080
But he knew he was only doing it
through his loyalty to Jim.

1012
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:30,280
I just said that, "Oh, well,
you know, that'll finish Big Jim."

1013
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,400
When there's a doubt,
there's no doubt.

1014
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:39,160
And I... I'd made my mind up.
I'd made my mind up.

1015
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,360
I then went to Jim's room.

1016
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,720
And I told him,
and he burst out crying.

1017
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,520
So, the big
news is that Jim Leighton is dropped.

1018
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:58,920
A major decision by Alex
Ferguson to drop a goalkeeper

1019
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,560
who played in so many
Scottish Cup finals for him.

1020
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,240
And on it may hinge
an awful lot of futures.

1021
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:09,120
And Les Sealey
gets a surprise call-up.

1022
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:11,120
Sealey was not
as good a goalkeeper.

1023
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,160
But he thought he was, you know?

1024
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,680
Pardew
closing in and so was Mark Bright.

1025
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,840
And that's the first test
for Les Sealey.

1026
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,560
And Les Sealey does well.

1027
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:31,520
And it's Gray. Oh! Saved by
Sealey's legs! That's a good stop!

1028
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:34,360
The goalkeeper
takes credit again.

1029
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,040
Lee Martin, inspired run on the far
side. A chance here... and a goal!

1030
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,400
Manchester United
have won the F.A. Cup!

1031
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:48,560
Alex Ferguson's first
major trophy at Old Trafford.

1032
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,720
And just look
at that man's face!

1033
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,840
The years seem to have fallen
away there from Alex Ferguson,

1034
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:56,360
after a season of torment
and tribulation.

1035
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,800
Making big decisions
affecting players' careers...

1036
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,200
is not easy.

1037
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,160
He might have
called it ruthless.

1038
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:27,880
Do you still feel
a Manchester United player?

1039
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:35,480
I don't think...
They days are gone now.

1040
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,520
- Really?
- I think so, yeah.

1041
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,760
I think from both sides,
those days are gone now.

1042
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:42,760
Never spoke to me again.

1043
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,960
Yeah... so...

1044
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,040
You lose a friend, or you lose

1045
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:52,640
someone that you'd given
his first opportunity in life.

1046
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:59,120
But make no mistake,
it was the correct decision.

1047
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,360
- Want some water?
- I'm all right.

1048
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,480
Okay.

1049
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,680
I got home.

1050
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,640
All the things that were
bottling up inside me...

1051
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:50,760
it was a sort of,
uh, opening up.

1052
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:54,160
You know, you just
want to spill it all out.

1053
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,640
I don't know
if you want to kick off?

1054
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:58,320
No, I think that, um...

1055
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,320
It's been an experience.
I think that...

1056
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,320
What I... what you realise is...

1057
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,840
that what happens when you die,

1058
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:18,320
is it... people suffer cancer,

1059
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:21,240
and there's a long period
before they do.

1060
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:24,920
But when it happens like that,
they say it's the best way to go.

1061
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,240
But you don't remember anything.

1062
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:30,840
When I collapsed
that Saturday morning,

1063
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:35,360
and I had no idea from that
moment on, what-what happened.

1064
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:40,600
People say that I was sitting up
talking in Macclesfield Hospital,

1065
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,360
before I went to Royal Salford.

1066
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:46,920
But I don't remember a thing.
So...

1067
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,720
I'm not sure when the moment
comes and you do die,

1068
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,960
whether it's the best way to go.

1069
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,760
In the moments
when you're on your own,

1070
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,560
there's that fear
and there's that loneliness.

1071
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,000
That creeps
into your mind and...

1072
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:11,520
you don't want to die. You
know, and that's where I was at.

1073
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:15,360
I don't want to, I'm not
gonna die. I don't want to die.

1074
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:19,000
These things did flash
through my mind quite a lot.

1075
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,560
They had wanted him to go

1076
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,400
to the first game
of the season at Old Trafford.

1077
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:30,480
But Dr George says no,
it was too much, you know.

1078
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,120
Far too much. And we said that
ourselves, you know.

1079
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:37,120
'Cause everybody's going to be...
Cameras, everything, you know.

1080
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,840
I have a slight concern about
going to watch United again

1081
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,400
in terms of the first time.

1082
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,600
A third of my life
has been at United,

1083
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,720
creating a certain type
of football club.

1084
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:58,840
But you're still walking into
a sort of, uh, an unknown...

1085
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,000
situation for yourself.

1086
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:07,240
Somewhere inside you,
you know, there's a doubt.

1087
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,040
A long-term approach
always suited me,

1088
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:38,240
to go the long road
to shape my future.

1089
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:41,840
And number 14
is 17-year old Ryan Giggs.

1090
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,680
Manchester United believe
we may be seeing the start

1091
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:47,920
of a very special career
here this afternoon.

1092
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,440
If you get them young enough,

1093
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:55,280
and breed the important values

1094
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:58,160
of what you're trying to
achieve with them,

1095
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:03,360
they became that particular
person you were looking for.

1096
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:07,000
Do you have to treat them, you know,
differently to-to the established stars?

1097
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,560
Absolutely. You've got to be
real hard on them.

1098
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,176
Because they're facing for
the first time in their lives...

1099
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,736
- Harder on them?
- Oh, yes.

1100
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,560
- Really?
- Absolutely.

1101
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:18,120
They're facing for the first time
in their lives, media attention.

1102
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,920
And you won't get the crit... you
don't get any criticism from journalism

1103
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:25,080
to young boys. It's all praise.

1104
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,440
- That's ahead.
- Do you sometimes feel like a bully?

1105
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:30,320
No, no, no, no! I think they
realise that it's for their own good.

1106
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,360
My Dad left when I was 14.

1107
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:42,080
I had two mainstays in my life:

1108
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:45,320
My grandad and the manager.

1109
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,960
There was definitely
that father-son relationship.

1110
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,480
Um, sometimes that was good,

1111
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:56,880
sometimes that was bad because he
felt he could say whatever he wanted.

1112
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:00,040
Um, which was tough to take,
especially when you're an 18, 19 year-old.

1113
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,920
Honestly, sometimes, you know,

1114
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,920
he would have fights with the
players, or nearly have fights.

1115
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,960
I wanted to, because he
would be right in your face,

1116
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,080
screaming at you.

1117
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,400
To the outside world,
you've got this reputation...

1118
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,760
as this fearsome character.

1119
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,200
Yeah, absolutely.

1120
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:36,080
That fearsome character

1121
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,960
has been portrayed
throughout my career.

1122
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:45,920
I mean... That's
the baggage I've had to carry.

1123
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,320
Maybe times when you felt,

1124
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:50,200
"Oh, went maybe
a bit too far there."

1125
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:51,640
Oh, there'd be plenty times.

1126
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,840
But...

1127
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:58,056
I don't think there's anything
wrong with losing your temper

1128
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,600
if it's for the right reasons,
you know?

1129
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,960
Where they didn't reach
their expectation in a game,

1130
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
because everything's
built around what we expect

1131
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,960
in terms of the standard
of our training,

1132
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,280
and the ambitions
of the football club.

1133
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:17,560
Because my experience
of human beings...

1134
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,360
they'd like to do things
the easiest way.

1135
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:24,920
The minute you-you accept
a bad performance from them,

1136
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,800
or a bad technical aspect
of their training,

1137
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:29,880
they'll do it again.

1138
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:34,920
I remember, against Juventus.

1139
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:40,840
I spent the whole half, I mean,
which is what I did, dribbling, and yeah.

1140
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,920
Conte was taking it off me. And
they were going on and attacking.

1141
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,176
And I wasn't having a good game.

1142
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,160
At half time,

1143
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,200
and the manager
just went for me straight away.

1144
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:53,280
"Stop dribbling in midfield."
And this argument started, and...

1145
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,680
I've got these
blackcurrant drinks

1146
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:58,120
that we used to have at
half-time, and I threw it.

1147
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:59,560
Threw it right
at the gaffer's feet.

1148
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:04,640
So Giggs is off.

1149
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:09,000
He was always in control.

1150
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:12,880
You were never in any doubt,
who was the boss.

1151
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,160
Yeah, I could be.

1152
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,600
I could be ferocious

1153
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,120
in terms of my criticism
after games.

1154
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,960
But sometimes
I never said a word to them.

1155
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,040
Sometimes I would gather them
altogether,

1156
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:26,960
and I never
made myself predictable.

1157
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,000
But away from football,

1158
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:35,480
he would sometimes spot
if there was something wrong.

1159
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,200
"Is everything okay at home? You
know you can always talk to me."

1160
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,480
That was comforting to me.
That was comforting to me

1161
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,136
that no matter
how many arguments we have,

1162
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:45,720
how many... if I wasn't
playing well, if he dropped me,

1163
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,720
that I could always come
and talk about things.

1164
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,560
Because then,
it wasn't about football.

1165
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,600
It was about
how you are as a human being.

1166
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:58,520
It wasn't as if
I was their best pal.

1167
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:02,800
But they always knew I would
find a way to help them.

1168
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:06,200
If you want to be
the proper manager,

1169
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:10,320
and be in control of a unit
as big as that...

1170
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:13,840
you have to know them all.

1171
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,440
All these different people...

1172
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:21,680
with all these
different stories.

1173
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:45,200
I wasn't happy,
so I just reacted.

1174
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:51,320
It wasn't really the football
I dreamed about.

1175
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:22,000
Just lost that passion
for the game.

1176
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:28,240
I always remember,
I'd gone to a game in Paris.

1177
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:32,480
And I was sitting between
Michel Platini and Gerard Houllier.

1178
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,400
And right out of the blue,

1179
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:41,200
Michel says, "Why don't you
sign Eric Cantona?"

1180
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:45,360
And I says, "Well, isn't there
a bit of baggage there?"

1181
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:48,520
And Michel says,
"Look, he's a great lad.

1182
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,080
He just needs to be understood."

1183
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:55,016
Football. And
Manchester United have signed

1184
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,240
the French international
striker, Eric Cantona.

1185
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,256
You shocked
everybody with the signing.

1186
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,520
He's got a fiery reputation.
A fiery Frenchman,

1187
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:09,120
and with due respect,
a fiery Scot.

1188
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:11,440
How's that relationship
going to develop?

1189
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,296
I think that hopefully I've got
the experience to handle it.

1190
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:15,480
It's maybe a new challenge
for me, too.

1191
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:18,320
- Is it a gamble?
- No, I don't think it's a gamble.

1192
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,840
When I met Eric,

1193
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:26,480
I said to myself, "Right,
I'm going to forget his past.

1194
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:30,640
I'm not going to mention any
of his behavior. It didn't matter."

1195
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,960
What mattered to me was

1196
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,720
what we could do in terms
of bringing him into our fold.

1197
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:41,360
Like, a new kid, as if he was an
apprentice, or a newborn baby.

1198
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:46,440
It was to give him
that opportunity to be himself.

1199
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:50,080
In anything I do in my life,
if I don't feel free...

1200
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,160
I become crazy.

1201
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,960
He knew exactly what I needed,
psychologically.

1202
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,680
More than a manager.

1203
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:08,720
Somebody strong enough to deal
with any kind of personality.

1204
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,040
He was just
treated differently.

1205
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,040
Black tie do.

1206
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:18,400
I walked in, my top button's undone,
manager's gone straight for me.

1207
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:21,880
"Get your top button done!
You're representing Man United!"

1208
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:25,360
Two minutes later,
I'm sulking in the corner.

1209
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,720
"Flipping heck, he's just had
a go at me, again."

1210
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,880
Um, Eric walks in
with a white linen suit

1211
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:34,240
with white/red
Tiempo Nike trainers on.

1212
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:37,480
So I am like, flipping rubbing
my hands. "What's he gonna say?"

1213
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:40,480
So he goes over, shakes his
hand, and then turns to us and go,

1214
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:42,240
"Lads, that's style."

1215
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,800
But...

1216
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:51,040
when... when they... somebody like Alex
Ferguson give you the freedom you need...

1217
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,240
to express yourself,

1218
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,280
you have to deserve it, yeah.

1219
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:01,480
And you know how lucky you are
to have this freedom.

1220
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,680
It's why I worked...

1221
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:09,800
so hard and I tried everything.

1222
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:13,240
Everything...
I could give my life to him.

1223
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,400
He was, and is still
a great psychologist.

1224
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:23,280
Psychology
is someone else's word.

1225
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,640
I call it...

1226
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:27,760
management.

1227
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,200
Cantona's
looping header... And a goal!

1228
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:40,960
Cantona. Oh, look at that pass!

1229
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:43,640
Oh, that's brilliant!

1230
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:49,680
It was like a dream for me.

1231
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,600
That's the football
I dreamed about.

1232
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,800
And the spirit around football
I dreamed about.

1233
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:01,600
I think that was the first time of
my life I felt like it was my place.

1234
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,120
That's my house.

1235
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:06,400
And here's Giggs.

1236
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,800
Over the goalkeeper. Cantona!

1237
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:16,520
Eric came at the right time
to lift United.

1238
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,120
Eric Cantona, who
was only 11 and a half months old

1239
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:22,120
the last time Manchester United
won the title.

1240
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:25,000
We are going to do it.
It is going to happen.

1241
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:32,240
Bruce, yes! Unbelievable.

1242
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,120
There's still a bit to be done,

1243
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:37,240
but Alec Ferguson almost
celebrating the championship.

1244
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:43,880
And he's going to
the right, away from the marker.

1245
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,520
Ince! Yes? That's it!

1246
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,120
Get in, you beauty kiddo!

1247
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,616
Good evening from Old Trafford.

1248
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:52,976
There hasn't been
a night here like this

1249
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
for over a quarter of a century.

1250
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,880
But once again, Manchester
United are the champions.

1251
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,640
It's been a long, long wait

1252
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:02,840
since those days
of Best and Law and Charlton.

1253
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:10,800
It was unbelievable,
the relief.

1254
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:15,880
It was tangible. That
frustration of 26 years had gone.

1255
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:20,280
This was a club
that had come alive again.

1256
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:23,440
The champions of England!

1257
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:27,000
The ultimate accolade
for all players.

1258
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,800
You could...
You could smell the roses.

1259
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:50,440
You could smell the roses.

1260
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:51,960
There's no question about that.

1261
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,080
And, um,
it was non-stop after that.

1262
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:02,040
Elkins header only
goes to Cantona. A glorious goal!

1263
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,760
Manchester United
have won the double.

1264
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:14,600
And now, the plan we had
was finally the foundation.

1265
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:20,880
Oh, beautiful goal
from David Beckham!

1266
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:24,520
And Alex Ferguson is delighted
that one of his youngsters

1267
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,920
has restored
Manchester United's lead!

1268
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:32,200
Alec Ferguson has done
something never previously achieved.

1269
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,360
The Double-Double.

1270
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:47,480
Winning was always based
on my own attitude to failure.

1271
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:54,040
You have to treat losing
as part of the progress.

1272
01:24:56,720 --> 01:25:01,600
Throughout my life,
a defeat or a failure

1273
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:04,160
sparked something inside you.

1274
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:05,640
That I did something about it.

1275
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:12,160
As human beings,
you have to understand

1276
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:15,160
that adversity
is part of your life.

1277
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,080
And when it happens...

1278
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:23,920
you find yourself.

1279
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,640
Watford won.
To Old Trafford then,

1280
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:37,800
where Ian Dennis will be watching
Manchester United against Wolves.

1281
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,976
And Manchester
United have made four changes...

1282
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:59,760
The Club were going to make,
uh, a presentation to the fans

1283
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,160
that I was back, you know.

1284
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,880
And I think,

1285
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:12,320
the dilemma I had in my own mind
was going in front of 75,000 fans.

1286
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:15,720
I'm a bit nervous.
Well, not nervous, but you know.

1287
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:20,360
Sort of a...

1288
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:22,840
How do you put it?

1289
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:28,120
Tense I don't know... maybe.

1290
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,640
In the recovery part...

1291
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:41,280
I was starting to get these
dreams and repeated messages.

1292
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:44,160
Like a recorder.

1293
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,480
I had this song,
kept going through my head.

1294
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,120
All the time.

1295
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,240
And then there was another one.

1296
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,840
"And Beckham crosses,
and it's a goal,"

1297
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:03,080
going through my head
every night.

1298
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,200
I don't know why that is.

1299
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:09,040
I can't explain that.

1300
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,560
Maybe Barcelona.

1301
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:37,600
You like my singing?

1302
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:41,760
What's this?

1303
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:44,400
You were supposed
to fill this in some time ago.

1304
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:45,520
Statement of health?

1305
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:47,480
Your full name.

1306
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,720
Alexander Chapman Ferguson.

1307
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,840
- Scottish.
- And proud of it!

1308
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,800
Are you pregnant? No.

1309
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:57,160
High blood pressure,
heart attack, angina pectoris

1310
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:58,976
or any other disorder
of the heart or blood vessels?

1311
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,960
No, but that's coming.

1312
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,880
The way that team
of mine's playing the now.

1313
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,520
That's it? Right.

1314
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:13,680
1999.

1315
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:14,920
We'd won the League again.

1316
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:18,920
And we'd won the Cup again.

1317
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:23,800
But to be honest,

1318
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:26,880
it was all about Europe.

1319
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:32,600
Keane!
Roy Keane with a captain's goal

1320
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,480
for Manchester United!

1321
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:37,800
Manchester United
are in the European Cup Final.

1322
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:40,400
Full speed ahead Barcelona!

1323
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:43,680
In my time at United,

1324
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,520
my priority
was the European Cup,

1325
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:49,760
the Champions League.

1326
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:55,320
There was an anxiety in me.

1327
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:58,960
I'd won all these trophies,
cups and leagues.

1328
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,720
But not won the Holy Grail.

1329
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:07,320
It's about a reward for
sticking to what you believed in.

1330
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:15,800
This was the big one.

1331
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:30,600
The mood was great.

1332
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:34,520
The set-up was right.
Everything was right.

1333
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,880
Game on!

1334
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:09,880
Let's not forget however much

1335
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:12,120
Manchester United
want to win this trophy back,

1336
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:14,760
Bayern Munich
want it just as much.

1337
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,440
They have the tradition, too.
They have the expectations, too.

1338
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,800
And they have had to
wait a long time, too.

1339
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:33,160
It's something
that I'd had on many occasions,

1340
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:37,360
you know, that... that, um,
butterflies in the stomach.

1341
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:39,480
You know, you want the game
to start right away.

1342
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:57,480
Free kick
on the edge of the box.

1343
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:02,400
Tense moment.

1344
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:05,920
It's Basler!

1345
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:09,160
Oh, first blood to Bayern Munich!

1346
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:13,040
Mario Basler with
a little over five minutes gone.

1347
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:16,480
And Manchester United have
made it hard for themselves.

1348
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:31,760
Bayern are playing
very well, aren't they?

1349
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:33,720
Very efficient.
They've got a game plan

1350
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,440
they're playing at
and they're sticking at.

1351
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,440
We were a wee bit
anxious looking.

1352
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:44,640
We weren't making the chances
we would normally make.

1353
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:46,720
It has not gone
Manchester United's way.

1354
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:49,400
They were the better team.

1355
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,720
Scholl. Looking for Jancker.

1356
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:59,320
Looking to let the ball run.
Support. Stefan Effenberg. Oh!

1357
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:09,320
It's still Basler
on the ball.

1358
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:13,360
Scholl taking over.

1359
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:16,240
Oh, delicious chip
hits the post.

1360
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:18,640
You don't see that going
anywhere else but in the net.

1361
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:21,040
More danger now.

1362
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:28,840
Scholl's there with a header. Jancker
with the overhead. Hits the crossbar!

1363
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:31,360
Twice the woodwork
has saved Manchester United.

1364
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,240
Last four minutes.

1365
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:37,720
They were big chances.

1366
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:41,720
But... we survived.

1367
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:57,480
The Beckhams, the Giggs',
the Scholes', the Butts, the Nevilles

1368
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:59,880
were all brought up
with a mentality

1369
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,160
that mirror you.

1370
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:08,280
Where I came from...

1371
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,120
stand up for themselves.

1372
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,480
♪ We shall not be moved

1373
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:18,760
And stand up for their team.

1374
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:22,520
It's always been in me.

1375
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:26,560
And I like to
see myself in my team.

1376
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:29,520
To connect...

1377
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:31,680
to that history...

1378
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:34,360
of self-sacrifice,

1379
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,800
the determination.

1380
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:40,600
That working-class
feeling into people.

1381
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:47,360
Together.

1382
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:10,280
You didn't win them all.

1383
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:15,440
But you stood up for yourself.

1384
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,800
We're in the last
of the 90 minutes.

1385
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:32,360
What we need now
is the fourth official

1386
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,360
to hold a board up
with about 20 on it.

1387
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:39,600
It had run away from us.

1388
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,880
I started to think what I was
going to say to the players.

1389
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:50,320
And the only thing I could
say is, they were great.

1390
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,680
They'd had a fantastic season.

1391
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,400
I was proud of them,
I really was.

1392
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:01,880
It's gone against us this time,
you know.

1393
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:14,640
And the fourth official
put the board up.

1394
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:16,880
Three minutes.

1395
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:19,600
Three added minutes.

1396
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:34,320
Cross deflected,
out for a corner.

1397
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:37,800
Can Manchester United score?

1398
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:49,240
In towards Schmeichel.
It's come for Dwight Yorke.

1399
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:51,440
Cleared. Giggs with a shot.
Sheringham!

1400
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:09,000
Teddy Sheringham
with 30 seconds of added time played

1401
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:12,040
has equalised
for Manchester United!

1402
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:14,160
They are still in
the European Cup!

1403
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,520
It was bedlam!

1404
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:19,880
That's what it was,
it was bedlam.

1405
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:30,520
And it was, uh, funny.

1406
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,840
It was as if fate
had come along and says,

1407
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:35,400
"It's your turn, Alec."

1408
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:41,280
Extraordinary
climax at the Nou Camp Stadium!

1409
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:53,560
Just hold it.

1410
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:56,240
Calm.

1411
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:58,800
Composure.

1412
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:03,640
They've gone.

1413
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:06,680
♪ We shall not be moved

1414
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:12,360
Another corner.

1415
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:23,600
Beckham in to
Sheringham. And Solskjaer has won it!

1416
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:43,960
Manchester United
have reached the promised land!

1417
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:48,920
I don't believe...

1418
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:58,120
I don't believe it!

1419
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:23,480
And when
it comes to the final bit...

1420
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:27,080
I don't watch the game,
I watch the referee...

1421
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:31,320
to see him putting
that whistle in his mouth.

1422
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,560
The game's over.

1423
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:58,680
The game was over.

1424
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:01,920
God, we've done it.

1425
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:43,360
Alex Ferguson, they
put you through the mill, into injury time.

1426
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:46,800
Almost lost the cup, and you win
it. The new European Champions.

1427
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:49,000
The treble.
The dream come true for you.

1428
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:52,600
Oh, I can't believe it. I can't
believe it. Football, bloody hell.

1429
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:55,280
But they never give in,
and that's what won it.

1430
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:08,160
You start thinking,

1431
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:10,120
where's Cathy?

1432
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:12,200
I wonder where she is.

1433
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:17,000
Cathy.

1434
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:28,160
The period in the hospital,

1435
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:31,240
I wrote letters, yeah.

1436
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:35,040
I wrote down
what I wanted to say to Cathy.

1437
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:41,520
That's right.

1438
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:49,520
"I am proud of you, Cathy,
and your determination."

1439
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:52,000
All your years,

1440
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:54,280
you've shown great strength.

1441
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:56,960
But my heart
should pray for life.

1442
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,680
I don't give up.

1443
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:03,640
I was weak and lonely
and miss you, your light.

1444
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:08,520
My sons and you I'm proud of.

1445
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:12,280
You brought up the way in
control and inspection in school.

1446
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:15,800
"I wasn't able,
but I was too busy working."

1447
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:20,400
Mm. Amazing that...

1448
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:25,840
It's an abbreviation
of my life really.

1449
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:30,680
It's maybe an apology really
for not always being there.

1450
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:34,680
Uh, and I think...

1451
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:38,040
I think that's what
the letter's about, really.

1452
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:40,920
She is an amazing woman.

1453
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:47,680
She really is
the catalyst of all.

1454
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:51,520
She sacrificed to support me
one hundred percent.

1455
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:58,080
Fifty-three years married,
you know.

1456
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:00,480
That tells you a lot, really.

1457
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:04,800
You know, there's a lot of
sacrifice comes into that. And, uh...

1458
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:10,400
Um, a lot of patience
married to me.

1459
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,720
1986 was the year
Alex Ferguson took over.

1460
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:27,760
And now another landmark year.

1461
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:33,880
Champions of Europe!
Champions of England!

1462
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:37,880
Winners of the F.A. Cup!
Everything their hearts desired.

1463
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:49,360
- Was this the greatest moment?
- Definitely.

1464
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:51,480
Without doubt, it was my
greatest moment as a manager.

1465
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:57,960
It's exactly epitomised
all my teams.

1466
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:02,960
And I look back and...

1467
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:09,560
say now that-that was,
uh, the spirit.

1468
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:16,280
It was a spirit, and it was
there, right through to when I left.

1469
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:21,200
That night...

1470
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:23,640
it showed itself.

1471
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:33,480
Showed all the qualities that
got you there in the first place.

1472
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:36,440
They came out that night.
Never give in.

1473
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:38,920
Absolutely brilliant.
That's my best ever.

1474
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:52,840
You worry...

1475
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:56,840
you'll lose all this history.

1476
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:00,720
All these memories.

1477
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:08,920
But they live on.

1478
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:14,320
And they'll never be forgotten.

1479
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:16,320
Old Trafford.

1480
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:20,000
This afternoon we are honored
and delighted to welcome back

1481
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:24,520
someone who has been part of
the tapestry of the history of this club.

1482
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:28,960
Has won five F.A. Cups,
four League Cups,

1483
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:33,560
ten Charity Community Shields,
one European Cup Winners' Cup,

1484
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:38,040
one European Super Cup,
two Champions League titles,

1485
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:41,960
Intercontinental Cup,
one FIFA Club World Cup,

1486
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:46,440
and 13 Premier League titles!

1487
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:51,840
The impossible
dream made possible

1488
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:55,360
by the greatest British
manager ever.

1489
01:44:55,400 --> 01:45:01,000
Give the warmest of Old Trafford
welcomes to Sir Alex Ferguson!

1490
01:45:02,305 --> 01:46:02,716
