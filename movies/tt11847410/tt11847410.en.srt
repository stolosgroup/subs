Dude,
we are so fucking late!

21
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,002
Are the cake pops
different flavors

22
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,962
or are they just
different colors?

23
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,381
<i>Different flavors.</i>

24
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,965

30

Honestly, it is a miracle
that we made it on time.

31
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,606
Dude, we are killing it!

32
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:29,816
Per ushe, yes.

33
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,400
Also, is it just me
or does coffee

34
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,486
immediately make you
have to shit?

35
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:35,530
- Oh, immediately, yeah.
- Like I smell coffee and I'm shitting my pants.

36
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,032
Pause the shit-talking
till Justin Dragonas passes.

37
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:43,329
Oh, my God, I want him.

38
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:44,831
We need to come up with a code
for shitting.

39
00:02:45,706 --> 00:02:46,666
You're right!

40
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,334
Alright, let's think.

41
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:50,336
- Okay, like...
- We can say like I need to talk to my boss.

42
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:52,505
- What are you talking about?
- Are you picking what I'm putting down?

43
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:55,258
It's like, "Okay, I need to
have a long call with my boss

44
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,592
and he's mad."

45
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,344
Oh my God,
my boss is so mad at me

46
00:02:58,427 --> 00:02:59,554
that I got a penis call
this morning.

47
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,930
Oh, and then when you...

48
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:02,890
It could be like you're texting
your boss.

49
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,934
You're texting
your boss. I love it.

50
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:06,644
- We love that.
- You have to keep it fancy.

51
00:03:06,727 --> 00:03:08,688
We love to keep it
fancy, that's what we do.

52
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,649
Now that's also a concern because
most of that water is paleo water.

53
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:14,110
Dating back to the most rec...
Yes, Vada?

54
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:16,821
Does the kind of rock affect
how long the aquifer last

55
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:18,573
or how quickly it recharges?

56
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,449
Oh, that's a great question,

57
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,368
but that depends on
many factors.

58
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:23,953
Anybody wanna guess

59
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:26,414
what the next biggest
aquifer is?

60
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,707
So we have to think about
what we know

61
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,250
about the aquifers, right?

62
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:32,378
So the Ogallala Aquifer is one
of the largest eight

63
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:34,380
in the world,
not to... Yes?

64
00:03:34,463 --> 00:03:35,798
I'm sorry,
can I use the restroom?

65
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,008
Yes.

66
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,385
It dates back
to the recent ice age.

67
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:41,053
So when we think about that
we have to say, "Wow,

68
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,930
this is one of the largest
in the world."

69
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:45,433
Are you okay?

70
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,059
- No.
- <i>What happened?</i>

71
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,564
I don't want anyone to hear me.

72
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:54,275
Dude, literally just tell me,
you're freaking me out.

73
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:57,904
I got my...

74
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,782
What? I can't hear you.

75
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,326
I'll just text it to you.

76
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,376
Jesus, Amelia!

77
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:17,715
You don't text 911
when you get your period!

78
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:20,468
<i>You scared the shit</i>
<i>out of me. Oh my God!</i>

79
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:22,720
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:27,725
It's okay.

81
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,271
Wait, haven't you been dyin' to
get your period for like a year?

82
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,564
I thought you'd be stoked.

83
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,317
It's different than I thought.

84
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,277
Oh, you mean shitty as hell?
Yeah, I know.

85
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,404
You're the worst.
I'm hanging up now.

86
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,823
<i>I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

87
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,325
Do you, um...

88
00:04:46,702 --> 00:04:48,955
have everything you need?

89
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:52,959
Yeah, I stole it from your room
a few months ago.

90
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,585
It's in my backpack.

91
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,296
Just in case.

92
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,923
<i>I was just gonna tell you
to stuff a bunch of toilet paper</i>

93
00:04:59,006 --> 00:05:00,383
<i>in your pants till
you get home,</i>

94
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:04,095
but that...
That's some pro-level shit.

95
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,305
Nice move!

96
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,556
Oh, my God.

97
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,476
<i>How about this?</i>

98
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,311
<i>Let's go to dinner tonight,
just you and I, okay?</i>

99
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,813
<i>And I will fill you in</i>

100
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:19,193
on all the bloody, chunky,
gooey, goopy details.

101
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,820
Ew, shut up.

102
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:21,904
I love ya.

103
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,198
Congratulations.

104
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,284
Don't say congrats, you freak.

105
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,164
I love you, too.

106
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:51,892
Photo day.

107
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,729
Better get my shit together.

108
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,996
You don't even need
to wear makeup.

109
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,207
Sorry, what?

110
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,877
I just said, "You don't even
need to wear makeup."

111
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,880
I...

112
00:07:02,963 --> 00:07:06,092
What was that?

113
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,676
Come on, come on!

114
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,553
- Was that a gun?
- Get down!

115
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,517
Take 'em off!

116
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,727
No! Oh!

117
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:34,120
We're gonna die.

118
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,539
Go, go, go, go, go!

119
00:07:50,594 --> 00:07:53,389
Oh my God. Oh my God.

120
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:56,600
Is it over?

121
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,644
Is it over?

122
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:08,988
Who's in there?

123
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,491
I'm not the shooter.
It's Matt Corgan, I saw him.

124
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,662
Do you know where he is now?

125
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:18,247
I don't know, I don't know.

126
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,084
My brother.

127
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,752
Come, come under. Just...

128
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,598
Oh, fuck, are you shot?

129
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,268
My brother.

130
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,045
You! Drop your weapon!

131
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,755
Drop your weapon now!

132
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,260
Down on the ground!

133
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:49,922
Maybe we should
wake her up.

134
00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:51,799
She needs to rest.

135
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,467
I just wanna
talk to her.

136
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,462
Did you know him?

137
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,925
He follows you on Instagram,
so he knew you.

138
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,096
It's like on every channel.

139
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:41,557
Like CNN was interviewing
your friend Melody.

140
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,225
So crazy.

141
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,270
Did you know anyone who died?

142
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:47,855
- Amelia.
- What?

143
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,608
Is there like a list
or something?

144
00:10:56,947 --> 00:11:00,492
Sometimes, I'm just like,
"What year are we living in?"

145
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,329
I'm literally gonna Amazon
a bulletproof backpack.

146
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,830
Amelia!

147
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:05,914
What?

148
00:11:11,211 --> 00:11:12,838
Please don't cry, Mom.

149
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,215
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

150
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,860
Do you need something?

151
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:38,530
Was just gonna take a bath.

152
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:40,824
Okay

153
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,537
Okay.

154
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,898
Fuck.

155
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,748
I'm glad
you're going to see Nick.

156
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,000
How's he holding up?

157
00:16:01,084 --> 00:16:02,002
I think okay.

158
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:03,921
Good!

159
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:05,923
Good.

160
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,431
What about you?
How... How are you feeling?

161
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:24,942
Better.

162
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,320
That's good,
so good.

163
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:30,405
I'm really so glad
to hear that.

164
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,040
I literally thought
it was a drill

165
00:16:40,123 --> 00:16:41,833
'cause Cambie had us locked in,

166
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,335
shades over the window
in like two seconds,

167
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:45,504
so I was like, "Okay, clearly,
this is a drill."

168
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,755
- Right?
- Yeah.

169
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:48,173
And Olivia Metis is
like talking,

170
00:16:48,256 --> 00:16:50,175
you know, being annoying,
and Cambie goes

171
00:16:50,258 --> 00:16:53,512
- "Olivia, be fucking quiet."
- No.

172
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,514
And we're all like, "Oh shit.

173
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,391
Like this is real deal,
no joke."

174
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,352
It's just so...
It's so fucked.

175
00:17:00,435 --> 00:17:02,521
I can't stop hearing
the sound of it.

176
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,695
So last night,
I was like, "Okay,

177
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,488
why did I survive?

178
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:13,740
Like out of everyone,
like why me?

179
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,410
Is it so that
I can do something

180
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,162
to like make this
never happen again?"

181
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,914
Hmm.

182
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,749
So, I set up this Zoom
with Everytown

183
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,543
and we're gonna talk
about like

184
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,545
how to be more reactive,
how to start a movement,

185
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,005
how to get
a fuckin' bill passed.

186
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,172
Like something.

187
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,180
Why do you think he did it?

188
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,227
I don't know,
is there like ever a reason?

189

00:19:30,418 --> 00:19:31,419
Hey.

222
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,089
Wanna come in?

223
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,178
Thank you.

224
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,725
Want some water or somethin'?

225
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,603
Okay.

226
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,028
You have a really nice house.

227
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,572
Thanks.

228
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,741
Really nice, it's a cool vibe,
with the wood and uh...

229
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,536
You have a lot
of cool art here, too.

230
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:07,414
Yeah, uh, my dads
are artists, so...

231
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,125
- Your parents are artists?
- Yeah.

232
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:13,128
That is so cool.

233
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,047
It all makes sense now.

234
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,924
Do you know
when they'll be back?

235
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,261
I'm actually not really sure.

236
00:20:21,344 --> 00:20:23,346
Yeah, they're gone
like all the time.

237
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,729
Uh, I have to be honest
with you,

238
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,355
'cause if I'm not then

239
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,482
I'll probably feel really bad
about it.

240
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,818
But I watched some of...
Thank you.

241
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,363
Some of your dance videos
on Instagram.

242
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:43,867
In the videos, you come off
like, so like hard.

243
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,660
And whatever.

244
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,787
What I'm tryin' to say is you're
a completely different person

245
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,248
when you're dancing
and in real life,

246
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,541
you're like so different.

247
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,627
Yeah, I don't know why
I'm like that.

248
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,754
It's like... Yeah.

249
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:59,174
It's cool though that you're
able to like just switch into

250
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:00,509
a different mode.

251
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,760
Like I could never
do something like that.

252
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,011
It's dope.

253
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,766
Thank you.

254
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,685
Yeah.

255
00:21:14,397 --> 00:21:16,650
Is that...
Is that wine okay for you?

256
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,276
Oh, yeah, no, it's so good.

257
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,945
Are you sure?
I have like a couple of others...

258
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,238
No, it's... Yeah...

259
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:24,115
That's like the best one
I've ever had, so.

260
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,242
Okay.

261
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,124
- I'm sorry, I'm gonna...
- Oh.

262
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,585
I'll turn this off,
my mom keeps checking in on me.

263
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,379
Okay.

264
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,632
Nick told me that

265
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:43,760
Quinton's brother's service
is tomorrow.

266
00:21:43,843 --> 00:21:45,553
Already? That's...

267
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,222
- Yeah, I...
- That's great.

268
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:51,351
I guess some religions
do them fast.

269
00:21:51,434 --> 00:21:52,644
I was thinkin' about going.

270
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:53,895
Do you think
that would be weird?

271
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,314
No. No, I don't...
I don't think so.

272
00:21:57,732 --> 00:21:59,776
Okay.

273
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:03,363
I mean, I can, like,
come with you if you want.

274
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:04,906
Yeah, no, I...

275
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,659
- Yeah, I want... Yeah.
- Yeah, if you...

276
00:22:07,742 --> 00:22:10,537
Um, yeah.
If that's cool with you, so...

277
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,291
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Cool.

278
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,213
Can I ask you a question?

279
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,256
Mmm-hmm.

280
00:22:25,885 --> 00:22:27,679
Did you have like

281
00:22:27,762 --> 00:22:29,723
the craziest nightmares
last night?

282
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,477
You have to be able to sleep
to have nightmares.

283
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,540
Hey.

284
00:22:55,623 --> 00:22:56,708
- Hey.
- Hey.

285
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,461
Uh, thank you for coming.

286
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,671

00:26:20,411 --> 00:26:21,663
For like fun?

321
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,415
Work.

322
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,042
Do they send people
to spy on you

323
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:29,337
or they trust you just to not
throw a bunch of ragers.

324
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:36,177
I mean, they know I'm not
like a rager person, so.

325
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,055
Who do you hang out
with at school?

326
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,140
Like...

327
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,561
Like different people.

328
00:26:45,728 --> 00:26:47,438
Like a bunch
of different people, so.

329
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,067
I'm gone a lot with dance.

330
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,236
How often do you dance?

331
00:26:54,028 --> 00:26:55,738
Every day.

332
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,073
Like classes?

333
00:26:57,156 --> 00:26:58,324
Mmm-hmm.

334
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:02,579
But I haven't gone

335
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:05,415
since the thing.

336
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,090
Are your parents chill?

337
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:19,304
My dad more than my mom,
for sure.

338
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:22,724
My mom's like very white and anxious.

339
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:26,603
I don't really tell 'em
anything though, 'cause like

340
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,354
they worry.

341
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:34,068
I feel kinda bad for it.
They're actually really good parents.

342
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,908
<i>I see you're packing</i>
<i>for a trip.</i>

343
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,243
<i>What's your favorite
country to visit?</i>

344
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,536
<i>Paris.</i>

345
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,330
What's the last country
you visited?

346
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,748
<i>Europe.</i>

347
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,333
<i>What country</i>
<i>do you wish to visit?</i>

348
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,542
<i>Persia.</i>

349
00:27:51,377 --> 00:27:53,838
<i>What's the weirdest word</i>
<i>in the English language?</i>

350
00:27:53,921 --> 00:27:56,215
<i>Moist. Yuck.</i>

351
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,675
<i>When was</i>
<i>the last time you cried?</i>

352
00:28:01,387 --> 00:28:02,680
Can you stay?

353
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:06,976
It's late.

354
00:28:08,102 --> 00:28:09,604
Just till I fall asleep.

355
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:15,109
Okay.

356
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,195
Thanks.

357
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,327
<i>What's your</i>
<i>favorite movie?</i>

358
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,370
<i>Mmm, Pizza.</i>

359
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,288
<i>Favorite TV show?</i>

360
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,499
<i>Um, I would have to
say my pilot with Kate Berlant</i>

361
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,459
<i>that was passed on by every major
network and streaming platform.</i>

362
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,628
<i>Meanwhile, rapists everywhere
continue to freely make up 10.</i>

363
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:34,962
<i>What up, bitch?</i>

364
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,215
Dude, I'm so sorry I missed
the march.

365
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:40,468
I mean, it's fine.
I was just, like, legit worried about you.

366
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:42,345
<i>It was cool, though.
They let me speak.</i>

367
00:28:42,428 --> 00:28:45,223
I wish you'd been there,
but it's fine, I'll send you a link.

368
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,850
I know, I'm sorry.
I just...

369
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,561
It's a long story,
but I ended up goin' to Mia's house and...

370
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,522
Wait, lol, Mia Reed?

371
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,524
What?

372
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,942
<i>Yeah.</i>

373
00:28:56,025 --> 00:29:00,321
She... She's just been alone
and I feel bad.

374
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:04,367
- So I just...
- No, no, no, I mean, it's fine. It's just like random.

375
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,618
Is she okay?

376
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,161
<i>I mean, she will be.</i>

377
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,373
Are you okay?

378
00:29:10,456 --> 00:29:11,416
Yeah.

379
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,459
Just tired.

380
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:19,173
<i>We wanna know
how a 16-year-old can have access</i>

381
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,593
<i>to a military assault rifle
and that's considered okay?</i>

382
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,595
<i>It's not okay!</i>

383
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,472
<i>We want change.</i>

384
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,642
<i>We deserve to feel safe going
to our own school every day...</i>

385
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:56,127
It feels like so soon.
It's been like two weeks.

386
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,545
<i>No, I hear you.</i>

387
00:29:57,628 --> 00:29:59,255
<i>It's... It's intense,
but I just...</i>

388
00:29:59,338 --> 00:30:02,008
<i>I don't want us to be ruled
by fear, you know?</i>

389
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,926
<i>I feel like it'll be less scary
if we were together.</i>

390
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,178
I gotta go.

391
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,262
Okay, love you. Call me later.

392
00:30:06,345 --> 00:30:07,805
Hey! Honey, can I come in?

393
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,099
You don't have to ask
to come in, Mom.

394
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,643
Okay.

395
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:16,731
So it sounds like Nick's going
back today, huh?

396
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:19,984
Yup. He is.

397
00:30:20,067 --> 00:30:21,986
Well...

398
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:23,946
Well, as long
as you wanna stay home,

399
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:28,326
you know,
your dad and I support that.

400
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,368
Thank you.

401
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,000
There's just one thing.

402
00:30:42,548 --> 00:30:44,467
Were you tired a lot
before the incident?

403
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,846
LOL.

404
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,600
You called it "the incident".

405
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:54,936
Um...

406
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,647
No, I guess I'm just
always tired.

407
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,899
I mean, I guess, that's what
caffeine is for.

408
00:30:59,982 --> 00:31:01,192
Right?

409
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:05,196
What do you do
when you get tired?

410
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,740
Sleep for like
14 hours straight.

411
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,117
Ooh, I really like watching
early seasons

412
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,244
of the <i>Kardashians.</i>

413
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,079
The OG Hidden Hills shit.

414
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,207
That is my vibe!

415
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,551
What's this, you're just
gonna fax that to my mom or...

416
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,970
- Fax?
- Yes. Fax.

417
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,514
What are you, a time traveler
from the '80s?

418
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:36,644
I mean, I had my suspicions
when I saw those sneakers,

419
00:31:36,727 --> 00:31:39,230
but now I'm pretty convinced.

420
00:31:39,313 --> 00:31:41,107
Touche.

421
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,150
Touche.

422
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:46,821
Look, I know this whole
therapy thing is weird

423
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:48,322
and can be uncomfortable.

424
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,449
But everything that you say
in here is confidential.

425
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,452
And, side note, I actually do
really like your shoes.

426
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,371
They're very cool.

427
00:31:55,454 --> 00:31:58,040
No, I know. Thank you.

428
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,627
Are there things that you don't
feel comfortable talking

429
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:05,381
to your parents about that
maybe you wanna share with me?

430
00:32:11,178 --> 00:32:12,430
Yeah.

431
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,434
My porn addiction.

432
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,352
Okay.

433
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,898
I'm so sorry. I'm...

434
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,482
When I get nervous,

435
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,776
I make really inappropriate
jokes, so, my bad.

436
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,904
You don't have to be sorry.

437
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,655
And you don't
have to be nervous.

438
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,660
Well, I know that my parents
are worried about me

439
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,996
and they think I need help.

440
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:39,874
But I get it,
and that's fine,

441
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:42,460
but I personally am fine.

442
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:46,172
Like I feel like I'm really
good at managing my emotions.

443
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,298
It's...

444
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,092
What do you mean by that?

445
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,971
I'm just very chill.

446
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,140
Like a very low-key person.

447
00:32:56,223 --> 00:32:59,894
So when it comes to emotional
stuff or drama I'm like

448
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:03,272
"Okay, is this
really productive?"

449
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,859
Yeah. I get it.

450
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,070
But you know, just because...

451
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:12,573
It doesn't necessarily mean
that someone's being dramatic

452
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,992
because they're emotional.

453
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,452
You know, for a lot of people,

454
00:33:16,535 --> 00:33:18,037
they need to fully experience
their emotions,

455
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,373
in order to process
what they've been through,

456
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,667
so that they can begin to heal.

457
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,419
It's actually really healthy
to show your emotion.

458
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,012
I know most people
come in here crying

459
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,681
about their cheating husbands.

460
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,724
Vada, I wanna talk about you.

461
00:33:40,267 --> 00:33:42,353
I wanna know how that
shooting at your school

462
00:33:42,436 --> 00:33:43,813
has made you feel.

463
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,986
I feel...

464
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,035
It's okay.

465
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,453
I mean, it makes sense.

466
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,334
I want you to track
how you're feeling

467
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,628
using this worksheet.

468
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,547
So there's questions on there
that'll guide you.

469
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,048
You don't have to overthink it,

470
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,925
it's just basically there to
hold space for you to...

471
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:16,470
To understand whatever
emotions may come up.

472
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,765
All you have to do
is try and feel.

473
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:20,975
That's it.

474
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:23,102
No matter what
those feelings are.

475
00:34:23,185 --> 00:34:26,439
Then you can bring it back next
session and we'll go through it.

476
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,315
Or you know,
you can fax it to me!

477
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,567
If that's easier for you.

478
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,825
She said you were incredibly

479
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:40,202
Wait,
is she in love with me?

480
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,079
Oh, what's the point of
goin' to therapy,

481
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,248
if they're just gonna tell their
parents everything they said after?

482
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:45,958
Honey, she didn't
tell me anything.

483
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,252
She gave me a general assessment
of how the session went.

484
00:34:48,335 --> 00:34:50,296
- That's all.
- She thought you were doing really well,

485
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:51,756
considering what you
went through.

486
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,591
- Excuse me?
- Amelia!

487
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,969
She was on speakerphone.
It's not like I was trying to listen.

488
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,137
I'm sorry.

489
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,014
Whatever. Do I need
to go again?

490
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:02,183
Because it sounds like
she thinks everything is fine.

491
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,893
Well,
I don't know, honey.

492
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:06,562
I mean, do you think you're
ready to go back to school?

493
00:35:10,357 --> 00:35:11,817
- Aren't you coming with us?
- No.

494
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,277
Well,
I don't know what you want.

495
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,112
- I don't know, turkey.
- Toasted?

496
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,906

- We'll find out.
- Stoner thoughts.

- Hey, did you just say "stoner thoughts"?
- Yes, I did!

00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,329
Oh!

561
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,540

- Do I...

Is this cigarette
or is it like this?

566
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,383
- Cigarette? Weed?
- You choose.

567
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,010
- Weed? Cigarette? Weed?
- You choose. You choose.

568
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:51,221
Wait, other...

569
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,182
Oh!

570
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,353
Okay. This is it.

571
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,859
Yo, it has gotten so bad
though, like so bad,

572
00:40:03,942 --> 00:40:06,487
to the point where they're
cutting the elephant tusks off

573
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,738
before they release them,

574
00:40:07,821 --> 00:40:09,198
so like the poachers
can't kill them.

575
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:10,991
So, it's like,
"Okay, they don't have tusks,

576
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,118
but like at least,
they're alive." You know?

577
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,287
It's so messed up!

578
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,706
No, and then it makes me think
about the uh, what's his name?

579
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,583
The Jimmy John's founder?

580
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:21,543
Apparently, he's like
some trophy hunter.

581
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,379
But the thing about that one is
like I don't know

582
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,172
if I have the right to be mad
about that,

583
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:26,715
'cause I don't know
if it's true or not.

584
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,385
So every time I see it,
I'm like, "Is this real?

585
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,719
Or is it like this fake news?"

586
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:35,474
Like, "Can I trust this meme?"

587
00:40:35,557 --> 00:40:38,685
Can you be honest with me
for like 2.5 seconds?

00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:28,962
All...

632
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,757
All I want is what's best
for you.

633
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,426
I wanna see that sparkle back.

634
00:42:39,806 --> 00:42:41,850
You know,
Amelia got her period.

635
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,644
What?

636
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,314
- When?
- Forever ago.

637
00:42:47,397 --> 00:42:49,608
Guess she just didn't
want you to know.

638
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:02,579
My mom's tryin' to make me go
back to school.

639
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,916
<i>Fuck.</i>

640
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:07,334
When are you gonna go back?

641
00:43:09,294 --> 00:43:10,837
<i>I don't know.</i>

642
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,881
My dads said I could do
homeschooling as long as I want.

643
00:43:15,008 --> 00:43:16,468
Lucky you.

644
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,391
I'm gonna try
and get some sleep.

645
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,684
<i>Goodnight.</i>

646
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,603
Night!

647
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:49,084
Get out of the building
and far away from it as you can.

648
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:51,086
Next, you need to find...

649
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,724
Always remember
these three things.

650
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,132
That should
be enough for today.

651
00:44:37,215 --> 00:44:39,885
You can basically just review
your notes for the test.

652
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:43,221
Again, if I've talked about it,
it'll be on the test.

653
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,681
And guys, remember, I said,

654
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,183
"No phones
during classes, please."

655
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:13,377
Shit.

656
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,339
Oh, you bitch.

657
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,385
You dumb fucking bitch.

658
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,515
It was a fucking soda can!

659
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,186
Dumb fucking stupid...

660
00:45:31,269 --> 00:45:33,939
So today at PE,
Jack Booth was whopping the beanbag

661
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,316
and one hit me in the forearm,
and the PE teacher saw it,

662
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,984
and didn't say one word.

663
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,695
And I was like, "Okay, you're
terrible at about your job."

664
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:42,072
I'm sure he's not terrible
at his job, Amelia.

665
00:45:42,155 --> 00:45:44,324
Dad, he's protected
by union and tenure.

666
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,077
That's the only reason
he's still there.

667
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,578
How about you, Vada?
How was...

668
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:49,871
How was your first day back?

669
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:55,836
Just low-key.

670
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,505
So, is everyone
settling in okay?

671
00:45:58,588 --> 00:46:02,134
I don't know, it's...
It's heavy, but I think everybody's

672
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,969
just tryin' to move on.

673
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:07,681
Good. That's good.
I'm so glad.

674
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:10,434
Yeah, it's amazing.

675
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,060
Ugh, I'm so full.

676
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,103
Finish your salad.

677
00:46:14,479 --> 00:46:15,731
It's wilted.

678
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:17,524
It's good for you.
Finish it.

679
00:46:17,607 --> 00:46:20,819
I just can't do arugula, Dad.
It's the texture!

680
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:33,540
Hey.

681
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,294
Uh, hey.

682
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,464
Do you have any E?

683
00:46:41,214 --> 00:46:43,467
Uh, what?

684
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,514
How much do you want?

Oh my God, Vada! Hey!

750
00:49:45,231 --> 00:49:47,150
Hey, hey, hey!
Vada, what'd you take?

751
00:49:47,233 --> 00:49:49,319
I hate it here.

752
00:49:49,402 --> 00:49:51,905
Vada, what're you doing?
Hey, what'd you take?

753
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:53,531
Hey, what's on your face?
Vada, come on!

754
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:54,783
Spaghetti.

755
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:55,992
No.

756
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,160
Hey, you need
to get your shit together

757
00:49:57,243 --> 00:49:58,411
before someone sees you.
Come on!

758
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,789
Ready? We're going.
We're going!

759
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,999
We're going, okay.

760
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,796
Is it at least a good high?

761
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:14,010
Is that an elbow?

762
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,433
Why's your mouth
all blue?

763
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,894
Jesus, Millie,
what do you want?

764
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,398
A pen exploded in my mouth.

765
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,066
Oh, that happened
to me once, too,

766
00:50:28,149 --> 00:50:29,234
but like it was a marker.

767
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:30,527
Good story, what do you want?

768
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,446
Nothing.

769
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,384
Mmm.

770
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,100
Ugh.

771
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,818
Motherfucker.

772
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,237
Shit.

773
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:22,537
<i>Oh, okay,
so I guess you weren't playing.</i>

774
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,039
What does that mean?

775
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:26,041
<i>Let me read you this text.</i>

776
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:29,419
<i>"Uh, Q, I did drugs,"
with a Z, by the way.</i>

777
00:51:29,502 --> 00:51:31,796
<i>That was the Z
on the drugs.</i>

778
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,966
<i>Uh, "And I'm YOLOing hard.
Hit me up, honey.</i>

779
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,593
<i>Let's party."</i>

780
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:40,930
<i>And then you did this emoji,
and then this emoji,</i>

781
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:42,515
<i>and then a hockey stick.</i>

782
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,976
<i>You just spammed, uh,
spammed emojis.</i>

783
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,519
No, I did not.

784
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,438
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>yeah, you did.</i>

785
00:51:48,521 --> 00:51:50,732
<i>But uh, now why'd you do the
drugs, uh, with the Z?</i>

786
00:51:50,815 --> 00:51:56,071
Dude, I literally don't know,
so what had happened was...

787
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:58,281
Is, um...

788
00:51:58,364 --> 00:52:02,911
I was walking past Dan
Bonavure, and I was like, "Okay,

789
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:05,914
I know he's a dealer.
I know he has E.

790
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:07,791
I'm gonna take some like
right now."

791
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,667
<i>Oh shit, okay.
Uh, and how're...</i>

792
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,836
<i>How're you feelin' now?</i>

793
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,588
To be determined.

794
00:52:13,671 --> 00:52:16,341
<i>Well, I'm here if you need me.</i>

795
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:17,592
Um...

796
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:21,429
What are you doing later?

797
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,765
'Cause I was just
gonna be low-key

798
00:52:23,848 --> 00:52:24,849
and like watch a movie
or something.

799
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,017
You should come by.

800
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,394
<i>Okay. And I'll
bring the acid.</i>

801
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:29,354
Goodbye.

802
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:37,028
<i>So is he</i>
<i>your boyfriend?</i>

803
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,363
What are you making?

804
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:40,907
Slime. And don't
avoid the question.

805
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:42,450
This is way too juicy.

806
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,244
You've literally never
had a boy over

807
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,703
that was straight before.

808
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,205
Oh, sorry, sorry.

809
00:52:47,288 --> 00:52:48,915
I shouldn't assume
his sexual orientation.

810
00:52:48,998 --> 00:52:50,667
So like how does he identify?

811
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,544
You're asking
way too many questions.

812
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:55,672
Vada, you are gonna stay
in the living room, right?

813
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:58,007
No, I was thinking we're gonna
snuggle in the dark in my room.

814
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,175
Yes, Mom!

815
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,010
I was just asking.

816
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,514
Please don't embarrass me.

817
00:53:04,597 --> 00:53:07,642
I'm serious, Amelia.
Oh my God.

818
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:12,063
No!
No, no, no, don't go in the river!

819
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,898
- Why is he going in the river?
- I don't know.

820
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:16,442
This is the saddest shit
I have ever seen in my life.

821
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,027
This is terrible!

822
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,697
This is so bad!
Why would they let kids watch this?

823
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,448
Yeah, you said
you wanted to watch this.

824
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,033
- I cannot... You picked this.
- You said this was your fa...

825
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,910
I gave you options.
I gave you options...

826
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,287
- Come on.
- And you chose this one.

827
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:27,996
What are you guys
laughing at?

828
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:31,916
Amelia!

829
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,751
Sorry, sorry!

830
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:36,045
I just wanted to let you guys know
that the slime is almost ready.

831
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,547
If you wanna try it,
I'll allow it.

832
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:39,090
I love slime. I wanna try.

833
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,675
Okay! Do you want blue or red?

834
00:53:40,758 --> 00:53:41,885
Blue, please.

835
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,553
Vada?

836
00:53:43,636 --> 00:53:46,431
I don't...
Red. I don't care.

837
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:47,849
Coming right up!

838
00:53:50,351 --> 00:53:51,769
I am so sorry.

839
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,605
She's so cute.

840
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:55,315
Do you wanna watch
<i>The Staircase?</i>

841
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,066
- Do you know what that is?
- No, what's <i>The Staircase?</i>

842
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,027
It's this white guy,
who murders his second wife,

843
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,654
and probably his first wife,
and gets away with both.

844
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,740
Oh, a tale as old as time.

845
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,074
Tale as old as time, really?

846
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,576
Yeah.

847
00:54:06,659 --> 00:54:08,411
Wait, no, have you seen
the memes of like you know,

848
00:54:08,494 --> 00:54:10,330
all these women are obsessed
with these murder docs,

849
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:12,707
people have like taken these
photos of the Stepford Wives

850
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:14,417
you know, with the smile,
with the knife?

851
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,835
- It's like...
- Nah, I haven't seen...

852
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,879
Uh, and it says,
"Murder me, Daddy."

853
00:54:17,962 --> 00:54:18,963
Nah, I haven't seen that.

854
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,340
You've never seen that?

855
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:23,176
It's everywhere.
Check your timeline, dude.

856
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,512
It's really funny.

857
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,518
Everything okay?

858
00:54:34,979 --> 00:54:36,481
Is everything alright?

859
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:38,691
Yeah, uh, I'm sorry.

860
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,693
I just have to go home
right now.

861
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,572
I'm sorry, but you know, uh,
family stuff.

862
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:48,076
Yeah, don't even apologize.
That's totally fine.

863
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:52,956
Yeah, um, honestly,
I just can't believe that

864
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:56,459
you're gonna leave alone to watch this
cat flow down the river all by myself.

865
00:54:56,542 --> 00:54:57,877
Oh, you're actually
gonna finish it?

866
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,504
I have to!
I have to see what happens!

867
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:03,883
Okay, well, uh, text me
and let me know,

868
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:04,884
you know, what happens.

869
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:10,682
I hope everything's okay
at home.

870
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,433
You know how it is.

871
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,185
Yeah.

872
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,980
I'll see you.

873
00:55:35,456 --> 00:55:37,834
No, no, no, no, no

874
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,460
- You don't trust me?
- No!

875
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,170
- You don't trust me?
- No, mom!

876
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:42,880
- You don't trust me?
- Oh my God.

877
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,340
- You don't trust me?
- Stop! Stop!

878
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,591
No, now let me see
which one you have.

879
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:46,801
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Stop!

880
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,345
Stop.

881
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:50,638
- But this one, I heard this would be better.
- That smells like strawberries.

882
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,098
No, that's too...

883
00:55:52,181 --> 00:55:53,683
No, smell, smell.
Smell, smell. Smell.

884
00:55:53,766 --> 00:55:55,393
Oh! Ew!

885
00:55:55,476 --> 00:55:57,854
- Disgusting, I know. Oh God!
- You're so bad.

886
00:56:00,773 --> 00:56:01,983
This one does
smell good, though.

887
00:56:02,066 --> 00:56:04,777
Just take a little sniff.
Come on.

888
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:12,869
Ow, Jesus!

889
00:56:13,786 --> 00:56:15,246
- V!
- What?

890
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,415
- Let me in!
- No.

891
00:56:17,498 --> 00:56:19,459
You never lock the door.
What are you doing in there?

892
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:20,752
None of your business!

893
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:48,529
Are you wearing my lipstick?

894
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,239
What? No.

895
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:52,533
Can you tell Mom I don't need a ride?
Nick's gonna take me.

896
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:55,161
Only if you tell me why you're
wearing my lipstick.

897
00:56:55,244 --> 00:56:58,664
I think those fake glasses are
messing with your vision, dude.

898
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:01,000
Well, you know, everyone wears
fake glasses now.

899
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,668
It's socially acceptable!

900
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,339
Okay, wait,
serious question.

901
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:07,590
Okay.

902
00:57:07,673 --> 00:57:10,843
Now Drake?
<i>Degrassi</i> Drake? Choose.

903
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:12,678
I like wheelchair Drake.

You're, like, yodeling.

909
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:29,153
You probably
didn't know this about me,

910
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,947
but I'm the best yodeler
in my family.

911

Prove it!

912
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,617
You can't put me
on the spot like that,

913
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:35,952
'cause then that's just like,
you know...

914
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,412
This is like
a little preview.

915
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:39,205
- Yeah, this is like warm-up.
- Okay.

916
00:57:39,288 --> 00:57:41,582
You know, but I'm gonna get you
when you're not even ready.

917

And you're gonna
be like...

918

Hey, you know,
this might sound weird,

919
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,343
'cause like I haven't known you
for that long,

but, like, I feel
so comfortable with you.

921
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:56,097
Like we're bonded
or something.

922
00:57:59,016 --> 00:58:00,017
Same.

923
00:58:05,481 --> 00:58:07,275
When'd you lose your virginity?

924
00:58:09,485 --> 00:58:10,862
I haven't.

925
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,071
You haven't had sex?

926
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,239
No.

927
00:58:13,322 --> 00:58:14,907
Do you mean
you haven't had today?

928
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:18,494
- What?
- You dance like such a fuck princess!

929
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,912
What? No, I do not!

930
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,581
- Yes, you do!
- What does that even mean?

931
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,499
It means exactly what it sounds
like it means!

932

You know, th...
The fuck princess!

Okay, that's on me.

- Never assume.
- You never...

936
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:31,466
Wait, like, have you?

937
00:58:34,927 --> 00:58:36,095
What?

938
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,972
Obviously not!

939
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:43,019
I am so awkward

940
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:44,729

I will say this.

943
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,486
I feel like high school sex
is very '90s.

944
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:52,695
Okay.

945
00:58:52,778 --> 00:58:57,158
And waiting until college
is more now.

946
00:58:57,241 --> 00:59:00,203
I mean, I feel like I'm probably
gonna wait until I'm like in love.

947
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:04,207
Oh.

948
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:08,211
Oh, that's really sweet.

949
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:12,089
Or when you go on tour with
Drake one day.

950
00:59:13,549 --> 00:59:14,592
You just let him have it.

951
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:18,846
What's wheelchair Jimmy

What are you
thinkin' about?

962
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:30,126
Hmm?

963
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,893
Okay, I know you're a
woman of very little words,

964
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:52,898
but I know you got
some deep shit happening

965
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:56,402
in this nice little head of yours.

966
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,947
Beep.

967
01:01:00,656 --> 01:01:03,117
God.

968
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,535
Anything?

969
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:08,748
Okay.

970
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:13,336
Let's say this.
Let's say you die tomorrow.

971
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:15,296
Okay?

972
01:01:15,379 --> 01:01:18,674
And what if you die sad, 'cause you
regret not saying what you wanted to say?

973
01:01:21,093 --> 01:01:22,345
Then what?

974
01:01:31,687 --> 01:01:33,314
I can't say it.

975
01:01:33,397 --> 01:01:34,857
Why?

976
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:11,268
Is this okay?

977
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:36,979
Where have you been?

978
01:03:37,062 --> 01:03:38,939
We've been freaking out!

979
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:40,483
I was at Nick's.

980
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:43,527
Nick's been calling all morning
wondering where you are.

981
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,157
Vada, your phone was dead.

982
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,575
We didn't know if something
terrible had happened to you or...

983
01:03:49,658 --> 01:03:53,204
I'm sorry. I'm fine.

984
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:55,539
The perfect child
tells a fat one.

985
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:57,500
She better lose screen time
for that one, Dad.

986
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,251
Vada, come back here!

987
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:01,420
Vada!

988
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,965
I told you,
you don't have to know!

989
01:04:05,049 --> 01:04:06,759
- Vada
- Vada, don't be rude.

990
01:04:06,842 --> 01:04:09,011
Vada, what were you doing
last night?

991
01:04:09,094 --> 01:04:11,472
Nothing, Jesus!

992
01:04:11,555 --> 01:04:13,182
Are you...
Are you seeing someone?

993
01:04:13,265 --> 01:04:15,643
LOL, seeing someone. No!

994
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,853
Uh, I'll do it...
I'll do it.

995
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:23,943
If you're gonna be
spending the night

996
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,152
at someone's house, Vada...

997
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:28,322
I'm not
having sex, Mom!

998
01:04:28,405 --> 01:04:30,574
- Okay.
- Oh, my God!

999
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:32,117
What are you doing?

1000
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:40,709
Last night, I slept over
at my friend Mia's house

1001
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:42,920
- and I got drunk.
- You got drunk?

1002
01:04:43,003 --> 01:04:45,589
Yeah, Mom, I got drunk.

1003
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:48,509
I am 16 years old
and I drink alcohol,

1004
01:04:48,592 --> 01:04:50,928
and here's the thing,
I don't even like drinking.

1005
01:04:51,011 --> 01:04:53,222
I was just tryin' to live
in the moment,

1006
01:04:53,305 --> 01:04:56,517
and feel shit, and YOLO
or something, okay?

1007
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:08,112
Now if you excuse me,
I am hungover as shit

1008
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:10,072
and I'm gonna go barf
in the shower.

1009
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,660
Who's Mia?

1010
01:05:14,743 --> 01:05:16,203
Who's Mia?

1011
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:31,385
I'm not even tryin' to be rude,
I'm just...

1012
01:05:31,468 --> 01:05:33,387
I'm super busy
and I don't have the time.

1013
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:34,847
So.

1014
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:37,182
Okay.

1015
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:42,605
I'm sorry
I never called you back,

1016
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:45,316
but you didn't have
to get me in trouble, dude.

1017
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:47,318
Vada, I was just
worried about you.

1018
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:48,569
When I didn't hear back
from you,

1019
01:05:48,652 --> 01:05:49,987
I felt like I had to call
your mom,

1020
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:51,405
'cause the last time
I had seen you,

1021
01:05:51,488 --> 01:05:53,866
you had literally done drugs
at school.

1022
01:05:53,949 --> 01:05:55,409
So I was like, "Okay, cool.

1023
01:05:55,492 --> 01:05:58,454
Maybe she's like having
a serotonin drop from hell

1024
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:02,708
and she's like suicidal
on a bridge somewhere and...

1025
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:04,960
Then to hear like how freaked
your family was all night,

1026
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,420
I just...

1027
01:06:06,503 --> 01:06:08,297
I don't know, I hoped that

1028
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:10,466
whatever you went and did was worth
everything you put them through.

1029
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:12,301
But, you know what?

1030
01:06:12,384 --> 01:06:14,136
I'm guessing uh, it's more likely
you were with Mia Reed somewhere,

1031
01:06:14,219 --> 01:06:16,138
acting like nothing happened.

1032
01:06:16,221 --> 01:06:19,141
Why're you being like this?

1033
01:06:19,224 --> 01:06:21,769
Because I've
waited for you, Vada.

1034
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:26,690
For a month,
I've given you space and love to heal.

1035
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,651
But I've been dealing with this
my own way!

1036
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:31,820
You haven't dealt with
anything, that's the problem!

1037
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:34,073
All I wanna do is try
my hardest to stop this

1038
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:35,491
from ever happening again.

1039
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:39,703
Like why is that so hard
for you to understand?

1040
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:41,997
That's not fucking fair, Nick.

1041
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:44,333
None of this is fair, Vada.

1042
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:50,714
Yeah, yeah.
Mmm-hmm, go be with Mia.

1043
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:53,133
She's gonna save the world
with her hot ass.

1044
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:54,510
Fuck you, Nick.

1045
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:55,511
Wow.

1046
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,347
Nice.

1047
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,520
He's just hurtin',
I think we all are.

1048
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:08,816
He was so cruel about it!

1049
01:07:08,899 --> 01:07:11,694
Yeah, but you know,
he's under a lot of pressure.

1050
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:13,153
He has to be the face of this,

1051
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:17,700
just act brave, but, well,
he's scared, too.

1052
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:19,535
You know,
fear makes people act crazy.

1053
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:23,831
Okay, I...

1054
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:25,791
Like I'm sorry for like

1055
01:07:25,874 --> 01:07:28,252
calling you and dumping
all of this on you,

1056
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:32,297
especially, because it's
been the hardest on you.

1057
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:33,924
It's hard on everyone.

1058
01:07:37,594 --> 01:07:40,639
I think for me, you know,
when it hurts too much,

1059
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:44,810
I think about
how this can't be for nothing.

1060
01:07:44,893 --> 01:07:46,937
Like, oh, we won't even let
this be for not... Like, it...

1061
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:48,647
It can't be for nothing,
you know?

1062
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,941
Fuck. Yeah.

1063
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:58,532
Tell me about your brother.

1064
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:05,247
I just wanna know
more about him.

1065
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:13,130
He was, uh, real quiet

1066
01:08:13,213 --> 01:08:14,548
when you first met him.

1067
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:18,635
He watched everything now,
you know.

1068
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,095
Like, he'd be like,

1069
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:21,764
"Oh, that girl is gonna go home
with that guy

1070
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:23,891
and that guy is gonna go home
with that girl and..."

1071
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:26,977
Like, he was always right.

1072
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,063
He was funny.

1073
01:08:29,146 --> 01:08:31,899
Like always making me laugh.

1074
01:08:36,528 --> 01:08:37,821
He, uh...

1075
01:08:39,948 --> 01:08:41,575
He sounds dope.

1076
01:08:47,664 --> 01:08:49,958
I feel him.

1077
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:53,962
Now I know this sounds crazy
to say like...

1078
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:57,382
I just...
I know he's still with me.

1079
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:59,468
He's not gonna let me
go back and be sad,

1080
01:08:59,551 --> 01:09:02,805
he's not gonna let me go
forward and freak out.

1081
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:05,724
He keeps me here.

1082
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,726
He keeps me calm.

1083
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:12,898
I think he's definitely
still here.

1084
01:09:14,691 --> 01:09:16,860
Lot of people
don't ask me about him.

1085
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:21,031
They think I'mma like
cry or somethin'.

1086
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:24,493
Um, well, thank you.

1087
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:32,292
You can always talk
about him around me.

1088
01:09:49,434 --> 01:09:51,687
Wait, wait.
I'm sorry, I...

1089
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:54,022
What's wrong?

1090
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:57,276
I'm just going through a lot
right now, it's just...

1091
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:00,028
I just don't know if I'm in
the right headspace right now.

1092
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:04,575
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God.

1093
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:06,618
- I am so sorry!
- No, you're okay.

1094
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:08,412
I'm... No, of course, you are.
I'm so sorry.

1095
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:10,289
You're perfect, I like you,
it's just...

1096
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:11,623
- I'm so sorry.
- V, I swear, you didn't do anything wrong.

1097
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,125
I am so sorry, okay?

1098
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:14,877
No, don't be sorry, it's...
It's not like that.

1099
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,170
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

1100
01:10:48,952 --> 01:10:50,454
I can't sleep.

1101
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:05,052
You know, I can always see
where you are on Find A Friend

1102
01:11:05,135 --> 01:11:07,054
when your phone isn't dead.

1103
01:11:07,137 --> 01:11:09,473
You better delete me
off of that.

1104
01:11:09,556 --> 01:11:10,849
Like tomorrow,

1105
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,768
so I don't tell Mom
about your Finsta.

1106
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:14,061
Fine!

1107
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:17,439
Why do you care where I am?

1108
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:18,690
I don't.

1109
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:24,488
You're always at a house
in North Bay.

1110
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:25,656
Why?

1111
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:27,908
It's where my friend Mia lives.

1112
01:11:27,991 --> 01:11:29,159
Hmm.

1113
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:40,963
V, I'm scared.

1114
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:42,589
Of what?

1115
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,928
What if...

1116
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:56,728
What if a shooter comes
to my school next?

1117
01:11:58,355 --> 01:12:00,148
It won't happen.

1118
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:01,733
How do you know?

1119
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:14,037
Sorry, I almost got you
killed in a shooting.

1120
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:22,212
What're you talking about?

1121
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:24,631
If I hadn't texted you
about my stupid period,

1122
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:26,925
you wouldn't have
left the classroom.

1123
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,553
You would've been safe.

1124
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:32,055
- You could've died.
- That's not true.

1125
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:33,473
Yes, it is!

1126
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:34,725
Quinton's brother died,
'cause he was walking

1127
01:12:34,808 --> 01:12:36,476
in the same hallway.

1128
01:12:40,063 --> 01:12:42,524
It wasn't safe anywhere

1129
01:12:42,607 --> 01:12:44,359
Definitely wasn't your fault.

1130
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:48,780
Then why have you been
so mad at me?

1131
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:51,450
I haven't been mad at you.

1132
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:53,118
Why do you keep thinking that?

1133
01:12:53,201 --> 01:12:55,037
Because...

1134
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:58,749
You're never home anymore.

1135
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:00,667
You never talk to me.

1136
01:13:02,085 --> 01:13:05,422
We never went to dinner
to talk about...

1137
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:07,341
periods.

1138
01:13:12,512 --> 01:13:14,556
I'm sorry, but I'm definitely
not mad at you.

1139
01:13:20,437 --> 01:13:23,315
Can I tell you something that
I've not told anybody before?

1140
01:13:29,154 --> 01:13:31,031
We were in the bathroom.

1141
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,284
And the stall where we hid,

1142
01:13:36,119 --> 01:13:38,163
there was a moment where I...

1143
01:13:38,246 --> 01:13:39,915
really thought
I was gonna die.

1144
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:44,294
And it was
the scariest moment of my life.

1145
01:13:47,339 --> 01:13:52,302
And the only person
I could think of was you.

1146
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:55,013
Do you remember when I sent you
that "I love you, too"?

1147
01:13:56,681 --> 01:13:58,642
I thought I only had time
to text one person,

1148
01:13:58,725 --> 01:13:59,810
so I texted you.

1149
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:04,439
I didn't know that.

1150
01:14:07,984 --> 01:14:10,779
You're my favorite person
on Earth, Millie.

1151
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:17,327
Even if you get married
one day?

1152
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:19,413
No, fuck a husband.

1153
01:14:21,289 --> 01:14:22,874
You're my number one.

1154
01:14:30,006 --> 01:14:32,092
Don't let go.

1155
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:27,856
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

1156
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:30,817
Nothing is wrong with you.

1157
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:33,737
Oh, Dad, I...

1158
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:35,322
I feel so...

1159
01:15:36,948 --> 01:15:38,283
empty.

1160
01:15:38,366 --> 01:15:41,870
Vada, you went
through something

1161
01:15:41,953 --> 01:15:44,498
no one should ever have
to go through.

1162
01:15:47,667 --> 01:15:49,711
I can't imagine
how scared you feel.

1163
01:15:56,801 --> 01:15:58,720
Life's fuckin' hard.

1164
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:01,765
I'm sorry
for saying "fucking".

1165
01:16:01,848 --> 01:16:04,142
No, you're right.

1166
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,353
Life's fucking hard!

1167
01:16:06,436 --> 01:16:07,562
Dad.

1168
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:09,439
What? No one's around.

1169
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:12,359
Try it, it feels good.

1170
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:15,070
Life is fucking crazy!

1171
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:20,367
Yeah!

1172
01:16:21,284 --> 01:16:22,410
Fuck!

1173
01:16:24,287 --> 01:16:26,957
Life's fucking confusing!

1174
01:16:36,174 --> 01:16:38,593
I can't fucking feel anything!

1175
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:39,636
Good one.

1176
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:42,889
Fuck you, Matt Corgan!

1177
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:45,433
Yeah, fuck you!

1178
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:50,730
I'm scared to go to school
every day!

1179
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:54,109
I'm scared to take my children
to school!

1180
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:56,862
I'm scared to sleep!

1181
01:16:58,154 --> 01:17:00,532
I'm scared of...

1182
01:17:00,615 --> 01:17:02,367
time!

1183
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:05,620
We're not even
swearing anymore, Dad.

1184
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:07,038
Still feels good.

1185
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:12,544
I'm incredibly proud

1186
01:17:12,627 --> 01:17:15,964
of how smart and amazing

1187
01:17:16,047 --> 01:17:17,299
my daughter is!

1188
01:17:17,382 --> 01:17:20,802
Dad, don't be fucking cheesy!

1189
01:17:20,885 --> 01:17:22,887
Please!

1190
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:26,308
Never again.

1191
01:17:28,685 --> 01:17:30,270
Ah!

1192
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:18,485
Mia?

1193
01:18:37,087 --> 01:18:38,588

I thought you were
fucking dead, dude.

1206
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:08,660
Don't scare me like that.

1207
01:19:08,743 --> 01:19:09,994
Ah...

1208
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:11,162
Come on.

1209
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:12,539
Come on.

1210
01:19:25,009 --> 01:19:26,469
Do you hate me?

1211
01:19:28,763 --> 01:19:31,975
No. Why would I hate you?

1212
01:19:36,688 --> 01:19:38,440
Just scared the shit out of me.

1213
01:19:45,613 --> 01:19:47,157
And I don't regret it.

1214
01:19:50,201 --> 01:19:53,371
Just scared it was gonna like
ruin our friendship or something.

1215
01:19:57,792 --> 01:20:00,170
Yeah, I was scared
of that, too.

1216
01:20:06,384 --> 01:20:08,636
Then let's not ruin anything?

1217
01:20:11,347 --> 01:20:12,891
Okay.

1218
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:37,624
I think I'm gonna go back to
dance tomorrow.

1219
01:20:37,707 --> 01:20:40,585
Even though, I'm like literally
scared to leave my house,

1220
01:20:40,668 --> 01:20:42,462
I know I need to do it.

1221
01:20:42,545 --> 01:20:44,506
That's amazing.
You totally should.

1222
01:20:49,469 --> 01:20:50,637
Well, what are you gonna do?

1223
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,806
I'm gonna go with you.

1224
01:20:52,889 --> 01:20:54,724
No, you're not.
We never discussed this.

1225
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:57,602
Stop trying to get rid of me!

1226
01:20:59,854 --> 01:21:01,773
I am Postmate-ing us
frozen yogurt.

1227
01:21:05,985 --> 01:21:07,487
I think I actually want some.

1228
01:21:07,570 --> 01:21:09,405
Okay, then push.

1229
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:14,536
I like the doodles.

1230
01:21:14,619 --> 01:21:17,413
Who's that guy?
Is that Harry Potter?

1231
01:21:17,497 --> 01:21:18,873
That's Paul Dano.

1232
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:20,333
He's my celebrity crush.

1233
01:21:25,338 --> 01:21:26,714
How was this?

1234
01:21:26,798 --> 01:21:29,634
Processing through
all these emotions?

1235
01:21:29,717 --> 01:21:30,718
Good.

1236
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:36,266
I had a lot of ups and downs,

1237
01:21:36,349 --> 01:21:39,978
but I feel like
I felt everything.

1238
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:41,896
So that's...

1239
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,690
It's good, I guess.

1240
01:21:43,773 --> 01:21:47,402
I noticed that you used
the word "scared" a few times.

1241
01:21:47,485 --> 01:21:48,987
When did you feel
the most scared?

1242
01:21:53,950 --> 01:21:55,535
Being at school.

1243
01:21:57,996 --> 01:22:00,582
I don't feel comfortable
being back there.

1244
01:22:00,665 --> 01:22:04,460
Can you tell me more
about that?

1245
01:22:04,544 --> 01:22:05,920
You know,
all these kids from my school,

1246
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:09,591
specifically one of
my closest friends, Nick,

1247
01:22:09,674 --> 01:22:12,635
who I love so much, um...

1248
01:22:13,845 --> 01:22:16,514
they've been able to take

1249
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,641
what happened, and...

1250
01:22:20,643 --> 01:22:25,773
are literally using it
to change the world.

1251
01:22:25,857 --> 01:22:28,651
Like, they're doing so much
amazing stuff and...

1252
01:22:33,156 --> 01:22:36,492
For some reason, I feel like
I'm unable to do that.

1253
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:44,334
I feel like it has kind
of ended our friendship.

1254
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:50,131
Sucks.

1255
01:22:51,799 --> 01:22:53,718
'Cause I really,
really miss him.

1256
01:22:55,595 --> 01:22:57,263
What are you feeling right now?

1257
01:23:00,433 --> 01:23:02,268
I don't know.

1258
01:23:02,352 --> 01:23:03,686
Yes, you do.

1259
01:23:13,571 --> 01:23:15,156
I feel...

1260
01:23:19,285 --> 01:23:20,912
mad.

1261
01:23:23,539 --> 01:23:24,707
Mad about what?

1262
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:28,378
I feel mad,
because I had no idea

1263
01:23:28,461 --> 01:23:29,587
one guy with a gun

1264
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:32,173
could fuck up my life so hard

1265
01:23:32,256 --> 01:23:34,592
in six minutes.

1266
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:37,345
Fuck up so many lives!

1267
01:23:37,428 --> 01:23:40,515
Then I think I should be
grateful to be alive.

1268
01:23:42,308 --> 01:23:44,519
I feel like, I don't know,
maybe there's some

1269
01:23:44,602 --> 01:23:46,562
weird fucked up reason why

1270
01:23:46,646 --> 01:23:50,274
I made it
and other people didn't.

1271
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:53,778
Um, but then when you sit back

1272
01:23:53,861 --> 01:23:58,491
and you think about it,
you realize, "No!

1273
01:23:58,574 --> 01:23:59,951
There isn't.

1274
01:24:02,578 --> 01:24:03,871
There's no fucking reason."

1275
01:24:05,623 --> 01:24:07,625
None of us should've died.

1276
01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:29,939
I'm having a really hard time
moving on.

1277
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:53,963
Oh, hi.

1278
01:24:54,047 --> 01:24:55,590
I'm sorry.

1279
01:24:57,633 --> 01:24:59,719
I love you.

1280
01:24:59,802 --> 01:25:02,972
Sweetheart, I love you, too.

1281
01:25:03,056 --> 01:25:06,267
I'm gonna try to be more honest
with you about my life.

1282
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:08,644
You know what?

1283
01:25:08,728 --> 01:25:13,024
I would really,
really like that.

1284
01:25:17,362 --> 01:25:19,280
I've been really struggling.

1285
01:25:19,363 --> 01:25:20,782
Mmm-hmm.

1286
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:22,950
And I don't know why it's been
so hard to tell you like,

1287
01:25:23,034 --> 01:25:24,744
'cause I just didn't
want you to worry.

1288
01:25:24,827 --> 01:25:28,331
And you're right, I was acting
funny that time I was drunk,

1289
01:25:28,414 --> 01:25:31,501
because I did have sex
with someone.

1290
01:25:31,584 --> 01:25:34,170
And I was a little bit stoned,
but not as stoned

1291
01:25:34,253 --> 01:25:36,714
as I was when I was on E.

1292
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:38,299
Jesus, that was rough.

1293
01:25:38,382 --> 01:25:40,468
And the person I was having sex
with wasn't the person

1294
01:25:40,551 --> 01:25:42,595
that I thought I was maybe
gonna be having sex with,

1295
01:25:42,678 --> 01:25:44,597
but I'm...
I'm telling you all of this,

1296
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,308
because I want you to know
that I'm...

1297
01:25:47,391 --> 01:25:50,520
I'm never gonna do any of that
stuff ever again.

1298
01:25:50,603 --> 01:25:52,563
You know, the bad...
The bad stuff.

1299
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:55,983
Mmm-hmm.

1300
01:25:57,402 --> 01:25:58,736
Mmm-hmm.

1301
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:04,200
Okay. Well,
thank you for uh...

1302
01:26:05,576 --> 01:26:06,786
For trusting me.

1303
01:26:07,578 --> 01:26:08,955
With this information.

1304
01:26:15,378 --> 01:26:16,546
Was that too much?

1305
01:26:16,629 --> 01:26:18,673
No! I am...

1306
01:26:20,424 --> 01:26:21,926
I'm processing.

1307
01:26:24,428 --> 01:26:25,805
Don't worry,
it was with a girl.

1308
01:26:25,888 --> 01:26:26,931
Hmm?

1309
01:26:27,014 --> 01:26:28,391
The sex stuff.

1310
01:26:28,474 --> 01:26:30,810
It was with a girl,

1311
01:26:30,893 --> 01:26:32,603
so it's not
like I'm gonna get pregnant.

1312
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:34,856
That's a bonus, right?

1313
01:26:34,939 --> 01:26:36,858
Yeah.

1314
01:26:36,941 --> 01:26:38,901
Bonus.

1315
01:26:48,619 --> 01:26:50,830
Okay.

1316
01:26:50,913 --> 01:26:53,207
I'm... I'm ready
to talk about it more now.
