1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,211
My name is Dalton Russell.

3
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:47,963
Pay strict attention to what I say

4
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:51,884
because I choose my words carefully
and I never repeat myself.

5
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,970
I've told you my name. That's the "who. "

6
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,226
The "where" could most readily
be described as a prison cell.

7
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:02,019
<i>But there's a vast difference</i>

8
00:01:02,102 --> 00:01:05,814
<i>between being stuck in a tiny cell
and being in prison.</i>

9
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:08,943
The "what" is easy.

10
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:14,448
Recently I planned and set in motion
events to execute the perfect bank robbery.

11
00:01:15,157 --> 00:01:17,117
That's also the "when. "

12
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,872
As for the "why,"
beyond the obvious financial motivation,

13
00:01:22,456 --> 00:01:24,416
it's exceedingly simple.

14
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:27,002
Because I can.

15
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,714
Which leaves us only with the "how. "

16
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,009
And therein, as the Bard would tell us,

17
00:01:35,302 --> 00:01:36,762
lies the rub.

18
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,170
So, your mother tells me about

19
00:04:57,713 --> 00:05:01,884
a certain young lady who's helping you
with the Triborough Bridge project?

20
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:04,011
- Okay?
- All right, okay.

21
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,096
He's crazy.

22
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,312
- Now? On 51st? 50...
Yeah, that's where he is right now.

23
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:17,441
He's on 40, he... No, he's still on 47th Street,
but it's a much smaller space.

24
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,276
What do I have to...

25
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:24,532
Yeah, we'll get lobster.
I'll put it on Mr Ansinori's card.

26
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:28,577
Whatever. It's a meeting
with one of his clients or something.

27
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:33,415
Because it's been like over a year now.
Yeah.

28
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,712
I want to snap this guy's neck,
I swear to God.

29
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,175
So what?

30
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:48,013
So what? They're flowers.
They could've been to his grandmother.

31
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,975
They could've been to me.
It's my birthday, so...

32
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,354
Okay, so maybe it's a client's.

33
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,192
Okay. This is funny.

34
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:04,280
I got this guy in front of me
that thinks I don't see him looking at me.

35
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:07,616
Fantastic. God damn it.

36
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,285
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

37
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:11,954
Can you lower your voice
just a little bit, please?

38
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:14,957
You're getting a little loud on your phone.
Please.

39
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,292
Yeah. Fine.

40
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,127
I don't want you
disturbing the other customers.

41
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,461
- Sorry.
- All right?

42
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,463
- Yeah, you got it.
- Thank you.

43
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,176
It was a security guy.

44
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,470
I didn't know I was in a library.
It's a fucking bank.

45
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,139
Manhattan Trust.

46
00:06:33,517 --> 00:06:37,146
...from Yale.
And this fucking rich prick I work for.

47
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,776
Thank you.

48
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,749
Excuse me. Sir?

49
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,167
Easy.

50
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,712
Everybody get down on the fucking floor!
Now!

51
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,341
Get down on the ground!

52
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:09,261
You have four seconds!
Anyone still standing gets shot!

53
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,765
One! Two! Three!

54
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:16,519
Back away from that counter!
Get your hand away from that button!

55
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,688
Put your hands on the floor! Now!

56
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,607
Oh... What the... What is this?

57
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,026
- Todd, what are we gonna do?
- What the fuck do you want me to do?

58
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:26,195
Keep your head down, fat man!
- All right!

59
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,739
Get your fucking face on the floor!

60
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,370
You get the same treatment
as everyone else, Rabbi.

61
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,913
Get down.

62
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,295
Now, my friends and I are making

63
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,090
a very large withdrawal from this bank.

64
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:50,761
Anybody gets in our way
gets a bullet in the brain.

65
00:07:52,888 --> 00:07:55,349
Lie down, old man!
Put your fucking hands down!

66
00:07:55,432 --> 00:07:58,894
Get your face on the floor.
All right, I'm down! I'm down!

67
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,942
Hey, Officer,
there's smoke coming out of there.

68
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:21,208
Possible 10-30. Manhattan Trust.
20 Exchange Place.

69
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,085
I have got hostages.

70
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:27,131
You fucking cops come near this door,
I start killing people.

71
00:08:27,464 --> 00:08:29,341
I not fucking kidding, man.

72
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,349
Central. Give me an 85.

73
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,185
Back up, sir! Back up! You!

74
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,644
Shit!
- Back up! Back up!

75
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,271
Stay around the corner!

76
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:44,315
Central, give me an 85.

77
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,650
Perp with a gun. Possible hostages.

78
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:50,029
I repeat, possible hostages.
20 Exchange. Manhattan Trust.

79
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,780
Baby, I'm fighting for my life over here.

80
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,825
Keith, every time we have this conversation,
it's the same thing.

81
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,160
<i>- "Not now. "
- Listen. Listen.</i>

82
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:58,412
Do you know what kind of thin ice
I'm on right now

83
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:00,539
with this cheque-cashing thing?
They want to lock me up.

84
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,833
<i>If this $140,000 doesn't show up
somewhere soon,</i>

85
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,169
<i>- things gonna get rough for me.
- But you didn't take it.</i>

86
00:09:05,252 --> 00:09:08,005
Of course I didn't take it, baby.
It's just some lying drug dealer

87
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:10,007
trying to save his own ass
by fucking me over.

88
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,842
<i>- Eventually, it'll go away.
- Then what?</i>

89
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,178
<i>- What about us?
- Then, you know, I'll make First Grade</i>

90
00:09:14,261 --> 00:09:17,097
and we'll have enough money
to buy a bigger place and then, you know...

91
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,975
Why we got to have this conversation
every time your brother gets locked up

92
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,978
<i>- or gets caught stealing a car?
- He's the only family I've got.</i>

93
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,980
All right, I'm sorry, baby. You okay?

94
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,690
- You still love me?
- I'm sorry, too.

95
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,359
<i>- You still love me?
- I love you, baby.</i>

96
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,569
All right. Big Willie and the twins for you
when I get home.

97
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,988
- I got the handcuffs.
- I got the gun.

98
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,573
Bye, Big Daddy.

99
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,910
- Big Willie and the twins, huh?
- That's correct.

100
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:41,872
Her lowlife brother, he's got three priors,
one for armed robbery.

101
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,209
17-year-old high-school dropout.
Doesn't have an honest bone in his body

102
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:48,587
and he's too fucking stupid
to amount to anything. Even as a criminal.

103
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,006
- Can't you get rid of him?
- I could, couldn't I?

104
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,551
No, she loves him. What am I gonna do?
Put him out in the street?

105
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,219
- How's he feel about you?
- Oh, he's thrilled.

106
00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:57,012
To have a detective
sleeping in the next room,

107
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,306
banging his sister.
Then she tries to bring it all back on me.

108
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,017
You know, "If we had a bigger place,
we wouldn't have this problem. "

109
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,645
Of course, if we got married
then things would be different.

110
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:07,690
- And what's wrong with that?
- A wedding. Furniture. Kids.

111
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,233
You know what a diamond ring costs?

112
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:11,735
- Come on, man. You've been married.
- Please. I was 21.

113
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:15,281
- Yeah, but you give her a ring?
- Yeah, but she won't call me back.

114
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,409
- You guys cops?
- Oh, shit! He made us!

115
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,911
Christmas came early for you this year.

116
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:24,081
Bank robbery. Hostage situation.
20 Exchange Place.

117
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,292
- What?
- Grossman's on vacation. You're up.

118
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,044
What about the Madrugada thing?
The cheque-cashing thing?

119
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,505
- I thought I was in the doghouse.
- I just threw you a bone.

120
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,299
As far as I'm concerned, you still work here,

121
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,593
- but if you don't think you're ready...
- No, no, he's ready!

122
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,303
Oh, good. Good.

123
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,930
I'm giving you a break, here.
Don't make me look like a fool.

124
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,600
- This is it, baby. The show!
- Yeah.

125
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,268
You got the call, man. God damn!

126
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,896
I guess I should be happy.
I might get to put off I.A.B.

127
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,939
Here's all you need to know.
You walk in unarmed.

128
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,775
Head bad guy puts a gun to your head
and makes you get on your knees.

129
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,570
You look around. There are five armed men
pointing Uzis at you.

130
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:56,197
Just picture them in their underwear.

131
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,865
How about orange jumpsuits and shackles?

132
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:02,244
- There you go, Keith. You can do this, man.
- Look out, bad guys. Here I come.

133
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,145
Get back around the corner!
Get back!

134
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,731
I told you, move it! Move it!

135
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,735
Get those people back!
Get them the hell out of here!

136
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:39,573
All right, guys, as soon as we pull up,
I want everybody out.

137
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,744
The second floor window. Now.

138
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,039
- Let them in there!
- Let's go! Go now!

139
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,292
Sarge, what do you got?

140
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,087
I got a perp in the bank.
Possible hostage situation.

141
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,421
Who's on today? Who's your boss?

142
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,674
- Sergeant Hernandez. I'll get him over here.
- Get him down here.

143
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,176
- Sergeant Hernandez, you on the air?
- On the air. Go.

144
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,012
Sarge, I got Sergeant Collins over here.
He called this in.

145
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,514
Can you come over to the other side?

146
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,850
Redirect, on my way. Let's go.

147
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,155
Back up! Go around,
around the corner.

148
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,533
Pull back. Pull it back.
We got to keep this secure.

149
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,743
- Collins? What you got?
- Hernandez.

150
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:28,998
I got a perp inside with a gun.
He claims he's got some hostages in there.

151
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,626
Everyone, heads up! Let's clear the way!

152
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,899
Let's go. Set them up. All right.

153
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,568
We've got it under control.

154
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,737
Step back, please!

155
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,072
- Step back!
- Get back! Thank you.

156
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,074
There's nothing going on.

157
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,160
You'll see it on the news tonight.

158
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,912
Step back, please.

159
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,133
Mr Case?

160
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,886
Oh, good morning, Katherine.
What can I do for you?

161
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,181
Sir, there's a robbery in progress
at one of our branches.

162
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,474
Oh, my.

163
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,937
- Has anybody been hurt?
- I don't think so, but there are hostages.

164
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,397
Oh, how awful.

165
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,194
- Which branch is it?
- Number 32. 20 Exchange Place.

166
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,280
- Which one?
- 20 Exchange Place.

167
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,701
Thank you, Katherine.

168
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,537
I'm sorry, Mr Case.

169
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,883
Oh, dear God.

170
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,013
Get these people out of here.
Come on, open these gates. Back up.

171
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,391
Up on the sidewalk. Come on in.

172
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,524
Sergeant Collins, first on scene.
Are you the hostage negotiator?

173
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,318
That's right. Detective Frazier.
This is Detective Mitchell. What do you got?

174
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,320
Not much.
Saw the bank was filled with smoke.

175
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,698
The door was locked.
I tried to take a look inside

176
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:29,159
and one of the gunmen opens the door,
sticks a.357 in my face,

177
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,829
screaming in some foreign accent
about killing hostages.

178
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,665
- See any other gunmen?
- No, sir. I couldn't see anything at all.

179
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,375
- You hear anything inside?
- No, sir,

180
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:40,629
but with that. 357 sticking in my face,
I can't really be sure. I'm sorry.

181
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,006
Okay.

182
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,760
Good, good. Good, good, good, good.
You did a good job, Sergeant.

183
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,180
You ever had a gun
stuck in your face before?

184
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,347
- Yeah, once.
- Really?

185
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,183
Yeah, by a 12-year-old.

186
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,686
- What was that like?
- Not one of my better days.

187
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,855
I bet. All right, well, look.

188
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,608
As soon as we get this thing cleared up,
we'll cut you loose, all right?

189
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,610
If you don't mind,
I'd rather hang around a while,

190
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,445
at least until we make contact.

191
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,697
That's what I like to hear, Sergeant.

192
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,469
What? Come on. Why you doing this?
Why you doing this to me?

193
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,389
Pop, what's going on? Yo.

194
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,438
All bank employees,
raise your hands!

195
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:44,568
Bank employees, this side!
Everyone else, over there!

196
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:55,412
Now, I need everybody
to take your cell phones and your keys

197
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:59,124
out of your pockets and handbags
and hold them in the air.

198
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,772
- What's your name?
- Peter.

199
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:24,358
- Peter what?
- Peter Hammond.

200
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,903
- Where's your cell phone, Peter Hammond?
- I left it at home.

201
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:33,659
Peter, think very carefully
about how you answer the next question

202
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,954
because if you get it wrong,
your headstone will read,

203
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,166
"Here lies Peter Hammond, hero,

204
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,586
"who valiantly attempted
to prevent a brilliant bank robbery

205
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,505
"by trying to hide his cellular phone,

206
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:50,176
"but wound up getting shot
in the fucking head. "

207
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,388
Now, Peter Hammond,

208
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,807
where is your cell phone?

209
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,476
I'm telling you, I did. I left it at home.

210
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,034
Okay, I fucked up. I'm sorry. Please.

211
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,078
Hey. Don't worry about it.

212
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,685
Just let me talk to you!
Please, please, listen to me.

213
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,270
Let me explain.

214
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,940
Help! Help me.

215
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,525
Stop!

216
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:31,527
Stop!

217
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,631
Anyone else here smarter than me?

218
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,974
- And you are?
- Vikram Walia.

219
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,768
Vikram Walia. Thanks, Vikram.

220
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,145
Hey, mister.

221
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,484
Keep it.

222
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,154
Men here. Women here.

223
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,615
Move!

224
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,832
I need all of you
to strip down to your underwear.

225
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:29,835
Now.

226
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,192
Lady?

227
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:58,864
Believe me. This is the only situation
where I'd ask you to do this.

228
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,536
- But take off your fucking clothes.
- No.

229
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,872
You should be ashamed of yourself.

230
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,376
<i>What's with you mishegoyim?</i>

231
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,711
Go ahead. Make my day.

232
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,381
- Take your fucking clothes off, lady.
- No!

233
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,342
Stevie?

234
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,180
Let's go!

235
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,184
Now, I need all of you

236
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:30,187
to put on one of these suits
and these masks.

237
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:43,409
<i>I'm Shon Gables, with CBS 2 News,
outside Manhattan Trust Bank,</i>

238
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,995
<i>where we have just been told
by investigators,</i>

239
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,746
<i>the bank has been robbed.</i>

240
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,083
<i>The suspect or possible suspects are inside,</i>

241
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,002
<i>holed up with an unknown number
of hostages.</i>

242
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,712
- Captain Darius?
- Yeah.

243
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,755
I'm Detective Frazier.
This is Detective Mitchell.

244
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:57,923
Hey.

245
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,342
You may remember,
we worked that hospital thing on 93rd,

246
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,052
during my training?

247
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,597
Oh, yeah. That was a real shame.

248
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,849
Yeah, it was. It was.

249
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,184
So, what do we got?

250
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,937
I got an unknown number of suspects
and an unknown number of hostages,

251
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:15,566
and a bank, and about a million spectators,
and I can't see shit inside there,

252
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,359
- so I'm kind of busy.
- I understand.

253
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,112
The way this works, Mr Frazier,
is I deal with Mr Grossman.

254
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,489
So if you need anything,
you can speak with him, okay?

255
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,575
No, it's not okay, Captain.

256
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,161
Detective Grossman is away on vacation,

257
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,122
so Detective Frazier
is the big dick today, all right?

258
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:33,792
Now, if you need anything,
you can speak to me, all right?

259
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,252
I guess it'll have to be.

260
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,630
That's the way it's gonna be.
You got vests for us?

261
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,964
- Berk!
Yo!

262
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,966
- Get these guys some vests!
- Okay.

263
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,927
- And check them into the command log.
- Okay.

264
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,678
You know what?
I'm gonna get out of your hair

265
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,639
and let you get control
of this crime scene, okay?

266
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,974
You'll let me know when you're ready
with a detailed briefing?

267
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:51,977
- Okay.
- We're gonna take a walk down to the diner.

268
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,022
Don't go in the bank without calling us first,
all right? Okay?

269
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,691
- All right.
- Good to see you, Captain.

270
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,827
Shouldn't we be in there?

271
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,539
Let's give him some time. See what he does.
Come on.

272
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,000
Until he secures his position
and gets the physical layout,

273
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,293
he'll only dump on us.

274
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,754
If the show starts, he'll call us.
Trust me. I've seen him work.

275
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:19,964
Your call, Keith.

276
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,341
Can you get that for me?
I guess it is, isn't it?

277
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,218
That's the one thing I learnt
from Grossman,

278
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,554
is these guys don't have much respect
for what we do.

279
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:29,014
- How do you mean?
- Well, to them it's a tactical situation.

280
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:33,227
Us being here means there's
a mental side to it that they don't get.

281
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,604
- Told you, you could handle this.
- Yeah.

282
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:39,066
I keep waiting for someone higher up
on the food chain to show up and say,

283
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,276
"Here's what we do. "

284
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,694
What happened at the hospital?

285
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,655
Guy shot himself, shot his girlfriend.
Thank you.

286
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,250
I told you, I've got

287
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,005
a heart condition.

288
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,381
Get up.

289
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,867
Put down
your fucking weapons!

290
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,244
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

291
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,455
- Don't move! Don't move! Come here!
- I haven't got...

292
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:38,000
- Come here, come here, come here!
- I work in the bank!

293
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,919
On your knees! Down on your knees now!

294
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:43,422
- They sent me out here!
- Now!

295
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:45,216
- He said stay away!
- Cuff him.

296
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,760
If you come near the bank,
he'll throw out two dead bodies!

297
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,762
- Who said this? Who?
- I don't know who!

298
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,263
The guy with the big fucking gun!

299
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,057
- That's who!
- All right, get on your feet. Let's go.

300
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,600
- There's four of them in there!
- Come on.

301
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,851
Christ!

302
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,186
- Calm down!
- Let's go!

303
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,648
- Am I gonna be on TV?
- Yeah. A big star. Let's go. Come on.

304
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,987
Was it a time when I thought
I might not see my family again? Yeah.

305
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,740
Yeah, I thought about it.
I mean, at first, I wasn't...

306
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:12,243
It was too much to think about at that point.

307
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:15,329
You know, with a gun in your face,
but after a while I...

308
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,581
You know, I thought about...

309
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,751
Yeah.

310
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:23,671
My wife, you know,
not seeing my wife again.

311
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:28,133
My kids. I got a 10-year-old son,
17-year-old daughter.

312
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,888
Yeah, I thought about it, man.
What do you think?

313
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,391
Those are my babies.

314
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,906
Beautiful.

315
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,090
Go ahead.

316
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,468
Miss White, I want you to rest assured

317
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,387
my only intention is to spend time
in your wonderful city

318
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:57,264
and to enjoy all that it has to offer.

319
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:58,724
And no business with your uncle?

320
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,101
In truth, I have very little
to do with him these days.

321
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,646
I'm told you haven't seen him in nine years.
Is that right?

322
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:07,274
- You are extremely well informed.
- I have to be. Yes?

323
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:10,319
I have a Mr Arthur Case
on the phone for you.

324
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,280
We'll need to end this here.

325
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:15,407
I'm gonna need
a copy of your purchase agreement,

326
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,576
your mortgage application,
and the other documentation,

327
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,829
- and I'll be in touch.
- Thank you, Miss White.

328
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,664
Right this way, sir.

329
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,552
Arthur Case? You sure?

330
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,679
<i>- That's what he said.
- He said his name, just like that?</i>

331
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,098
It wasn't his secretary
saying he was on the line?

332
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:41,141
<i>- No, ma'am.
- All right. Put him through.</i>

333
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,309
<i>Okay.</i>

334
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,607
<i>- This is Madeleine White.
- Miss White, I'm Arthur Case.</i>

335
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:50,150
Oh, good morning, Mr Case.

336
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:54,113
<i>- Have we met formally?
- No, sir, I don't believe we have.</i>

337
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:57,449
Yet, you're always turning up

338
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,869
at my July 4th parties in Southampton.

339
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:04,623
Yes, we know some of the same people.

340
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:06,000
It seems.

341
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,294
I'll come right to the point.

342
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:11,672
I have a small problem
which requires someone

343
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:15,050
with very special skills
and complete discretion.

344
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,971
Are you such a person
or have I been misinformed?

345
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,848
<i>Go on.</i>

346
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:24,560
Can I pick you up in front of
your office building in five minutes?

347
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,937
- I'll be downstairs.
- Thank you.

348
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:35,988
They had a kind of genius plan

349
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,574
for throwing us out of whack

350
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:43,037
and depriving us
of any kind of way of controlling ourselves.

351
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,206
They were... They were very

352
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,794
insistent, and yet, strangely detached.

353
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:54,757
All I know is that they called each other
a variation of Steve.

354
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,927
Steven, Steve-O, Stevie.

355
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,220
And they called you what?

356
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:01,305
They didn't call me anything.
They just told me...

357
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:04,475
You're lying to me. Tell me the truth, now.
You're lying to me.

358
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,393
Tell me the...
Look at me and tell me the truth.

359
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:09,104
They had AK-47 s out. Four of them.

360
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,940
- You know a lot about guns.
- No.

361
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,984
- I don't know anything about guns, except...
- But you know they had an AK-47.

362
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:17,112
- Everybody knows what an AK-47 is.
- Everybody?

363
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:21,116
Anybody who's ever watched
a decent action movie would.

364
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,828
- You ever rob a bank before?
- Are you kidding?

365
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:26,580
Me rob a bank? No.

366
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:28,833
- Never stole a dollar?
- Never.

367
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:31,210
- Never?
- Not ever.

368
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:34,380
- You know what?
- That one time. That one time, that one time.

369
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:37,925
I stole a nickel
from my grandmother's pocketbook once.

370
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,095
She was Polish.

371
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:46,016
<i>I used to go up to her and say,
"Mama, toh nicklah, toh nicklah. "</i>

372
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:52,147
One day, I opened her pocketbook
and there was a nickel.

373
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,607
I took it.

374
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,110
That was the only thing I ever took.

375
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,783
Look, Detective, I didn't mean
to give you a hard time back there.

376
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:05,035
Forget about it. What's the story, Captain?

377
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:08,873
Well, the hostage they let go
was Herman Gluck, 73.

378
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,333
He was having chest pains.
Paramedics have him.

379
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:14,962
They told him to say
that if any cops came near the door,

380
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,339
they'd throw out two dead bodies.

381
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:21,302
He thinks there's four perps.
Says they came in dressed as painters.

382
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,722
There's a video system in the bank.

383
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,724
We're working on getting a download

384
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:30,186
from Manhattan Trust's
central security office, but it'll take a while.

385
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,647
We got the block locked up.
I got men in the windows.

386
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:36,442
We're checking on the sewers with D.E.P.

387
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:37,818
What about the phones?

388
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:41,822
Cut and diverted into M.C.C.
We're the only ones they're gonna call.

389
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:46,619
Cell phones are monitored
and we can jam the air whenever you say.

390
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:49,914
But we like to leave it clear
in case a hostage is able to get through,

391
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:52,166
but so far nothing.

392
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:55,169
- 911?
- It's up on the screen.

393
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:58,297
Any call about a bank
gets routed straight to us.

394
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:02,176
Well, that's my end of it, Detective.

395
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:04,428
Yeah.

396
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,431
Yeah, I'm not calling them yet.

397
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:09,099
Beg your pardon?

398
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,477
Doesn't feel right yet,
you know what I mean?

399
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,437
I'm not gonna call him
and ask what I can do for him.

400
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:15,272
Let's see what he does.

401
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,775
Your call.

402
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:28,494
Now, Mr Case, why don't you
let me explain to you how I work?

403
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,538
Please. That would be nice.

404
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:35,584
Well, you say that there are family heirlooms
inside your safety deposit box.

405
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:37,044
That's fine.

406
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:40,840
But in my experience, people like you
have people working for them

407
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:42,383
that handle these kinds of things.

408
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:45,386
And when they can't,
well, they don't call me.

409
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:47,263
Their people call me.

410
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:50,558
So, immediately, I know
that there's something in that box

411
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:53,978
that you don't even want
your closest aides to know about.

412
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,397
No problem with me.

413
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,609
You tell me I don't need to know
what's in that box and I don't need to know.

414
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:03,571
But if you tell me
that it's a bunch of old baseball cards

415
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:07,616
and I find out that it's the launch codes
for a nuclear missile,

416
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,412
then let's just say
we no longer have an agreement.

417
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,455
- Have you finished?
- Yes.

418
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,791
What's inside that box, young lady,

419
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:18,586
has belonged to me
since before you were born.

420
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:22,882
It's very valuable
and poses no danger whatsoever to anyone.

421
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:24,758
Except you.

422
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:29,430
Okay. Well, first,
there are men with guns in there,

423
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,307
so I can't guarantee any results. Agreed?

424
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,100
- Of course.
- All right.

425
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:36,103
Now, what makes you think
that they want to rob your box?

426
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:37,438
I don't.

427
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:42,234
Well, why don't you tell me
how you would like this to end?

428
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:48,824
I'd prefer that nobody
ever touch my safe deposit box.

429
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,911
Not them, not you, not the authorities.

430
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:54,830
And the sooner this situation ends,
the happier I'll be.

431
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:57,625
- Is that specific enough for you?
- No.

432
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:02,171
The contents of that box

433
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:06,467
are of great value to me.

434
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,887
So long as they remain my secret.

435
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,847
And if they're exposed?

436
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,816
I'll face some difficult questions.

437
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:26,237
- So, it stays locked or it disappears.
- Precisely.

438
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,614
- Can you make that happen?
- Yes.

439
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:32,034
I hope so.
I have to say, I can't help but be sceptical.

440
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:35,037
Whoever gave you my number
got the same deal.

441
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:37,915
Clearly, they must have been satisfied.

442
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:46,966
Steve?

443
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,176
It's time for Steve-O.

444
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:59,019
I came out here to take a look
at the perimeter they laid down.

445
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:00,479
Guess what I found?

446
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:03,983
That hostage they let out said these guys
came in dressed like painters, right?

447
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:05,150
Yeah.

448
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,037
Probably stolen.

449
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:19,665
Have them run it and check it for prints.

450
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:27,047
- Everybody on?
- Yep, I'm there.

451
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:41,187
- Sure you got the right number?
- Absolutely.

452
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:53,240
Okay. Nothing yet.

453
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,244
We got video.

454
00:33:57,328 --> 00:33:58,704
Let's have it.

455
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:03,459
What happened to that camera
right there?

456
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,878
Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

457
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,383
Yeah, there it is.
That guy right there.

458
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:14,762
It's like he blinds the camera
with the flashlight.

459
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:17,389
It's weird, isn't it?
It's like nobody else sees it.

460
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:20,267
- You'd think it'd be pretty bright, huh?
- It could be infrared.

461
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:22,478
- What's that?
- Infrared bulb.

462
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:25,564
See, humans can't see it,
but a video camera will pick it up.

463
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:27,650
He could knock out the cameras
without no one knowing.

464
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:28,943
Right, right, right, right.

465
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:30,820
He knocked out
the cameras about 10:00.

466
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:33,030
So, for approximately two minutes,

467
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:36,826
we got no evidence of people
leaving or entering the bank. That's great.

468
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,954
Miriam, how long were you there
before it began?

469
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:41,539
It was just a few minutes.

470
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:44,792
Well, can you tell us what happened
after the explosions and the smoke?

471
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:49,171
They just told us to put our heads down.
And then close our eyes.

472
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:52,258
And then I just remember one of them

473
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:55,094
telling the others to just go down
and fix the cameras.

474
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:57,054
<i>- The video cameras?
- I don't know.</i>

475
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,098
Anything else you want to share with us?

476
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:00,307
No, just...

477
00:35:00,391 --> 00:35:02,184
- You sure?
- Yeah, I...

478
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:05,354
Could you give us
the names of the bank robbers, maybe?

479
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,398
I'm just messing with you, sweetheart.

480
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:08,858
- You okay?
- Thank you.

481
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:10,025
Okay.

482
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:12,111
- It was pretty awful.
- Was it bad?

483
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:14,363
I mean, they made us strip.

484
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:17,408
They made us take off our clothes.

485
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:21,871
I don't understand why they had to do that.

486
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:23,455
I really just thought...

487
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,875
I thought I was gonna be killed.

488
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:27,710
Well.

489
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,881
- All right, my dear.
- Okay.

490
00:35:32,673 --> 00:35:34,383
- I can go?
- No.

491
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,177
- No?
- No, you got to stay.

492
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,720
- You got to stay.
- No, you can go.

493
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:40,014
No, stay. No, go.

494
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:41,640
Did you rob the bank?

495
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:42,975
- You did.
- Did you rob the bank?

496
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,310
- No.
- You sure?

497
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:47,354
There's movement at the front door.
- Let's go.

498
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:53,736
Put down the fucking weapon!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

499
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,696
Don't move! Don't move!

500
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,072
He's got a device on him there.

501
00:35:57,156 --> 00:36:00,409
I said put your hands on your head
and get down on your fucking knees!

502
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:03,245
I said put your hands on your head
and down on your knees now!

503
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:04,747
Hands are tied!
Hands are tied.

504
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,957
- Jesus, pat him down.
- All right.

505
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:08,918
I'm one of the hostages!
- Careful.

506
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,377
Easy, be very careful,
now. Easy.

507
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:11,879
I can't see him from where I'm at.

508
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:14,840
I can see him. I got a clear shot.
Any weapons?

509
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,343
- Who are you?
- Vikram Walia. I work in the bank.

510
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:19,595
Okay. Vikram? Is this a bomb?

511
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,805
- Oh, shit! A fucking Arab!
- What? No. I'm a Sikh!

512
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:23,057
- Is that a bomb?
- No.

513
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,266
- Answer me, Vikram. Is this a bomb?
- No.

514
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,768
- Are you booby-trapped?
- No, fuck, no.

515
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,478
Okay, Vikram, I need you to relax.

516
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:30,189
- Jesus, give me a hand.
- I don't know.

517
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:32,316
Just watch.
There's a lot of movement in that bank.

518
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,859
- Team, take him down.
- Mike, now, get him.

519
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:35,361
What the fuck? Easy, easy.

520
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:38,197
Get off my... That's my turban. Get off. Easy.

521
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:41,700
Get... My turban!
Look, fuck, give my turban back!

522
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:43,118
Come on, shut up. Relax.

523
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:45,079
What the fuck are you doing?
Give me my turban back.

524
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:46,831
- You can't fucking rip my turban.
- Shut up, already.

525
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:48,082
- What the fuck?
- Come on, move it.

526
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:50,167
Get your fucking hands off me!

527
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:56,215
And the 11:00 and 12:00...

528
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:59,426
And don't forget about your 1:00
with Chancellor Joel Klein.

529
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,846
- Oh, Madge. What a day...
- Your Honour.

530
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:03,639
Madeleine! How are you?

531
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,308
I'm just fine, but thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

532
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:09,645
- Sure. Madge, are we through here?
- Yes, Mr Mayor.

533
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:11,689
This way, Miss White.

534
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:16,652
I always have time to put on a tux
and eat free food for a good cause.

535
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,571
Who are we saving this week?

536
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:20,406
Well, I'm doing a round of support

537
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:23,409
for the Joseph Freidkin Memorial Fund
for Spinal Cord Research

538
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:25,536
and we're having
our annual fundraiser next month.

539
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,580
If you could attend,
it would give us such a boost.

540
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:31,584
It would be my pleasure.
Is there anything else I can do to...

541
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:34,670
- What the fuck do you want?
- A favour.

542
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:38,591
- No shit. Which kind?
- The last one I'll ever ask of you.

543
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:41,343
That's the kind I had in mind.

544
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,971
You know about this hostage situation.

545
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:46,265
On my way. What's it to do with you?

546
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,475
All right, well, I need to keep an eye on it.

547
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:51,562
So, I want you to bring me down there
and tell whoever's in charge

548
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:53,647
to extend me every courtesy.

549
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:58,861
You're out of your fucking mind.

550
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:02,239
If it was easy,
it wouldn't square us, would it?

551
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:05,576
- It's impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.

552
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:07,828
You just have to call in a few markers,
that's all.

553
00:38:07,912 --> 00:38:10,080
I may have to give out a few.

554
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:13,209
Then that's exactly what you'll do.

555
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:16,629
You're a magnificent cunt.

556
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,342
Thank you.

557
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:28,390
<i>It's been a very tense situation
for several hours now.</i>

558
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:30,809
<i>It's unclear how many hostages are inside</i>

559
00:38:30,893 --> 00:38:33,312
<i>and how many robbers
police are dealing with.</i>

560
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:36,649
<i>Officials say this all started out
as a robbery at Manhattan Trust,</i>

561
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:39,610
<i>but has turned into this hostage situation.</i>

562
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:42,488
<i>Negotiators are here on the scene,
working very hard</i>

563
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:45,241
<i>and it's still unclear
on any possible injuries.</i>

564
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:47,576
<i>Of course, we'll keep you up to date
with the very latest</i>

565
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,579
<i>and we will remain here on the scene
as this all unfolds.</i>

566
00:38:50,663 --> 00:38:52,581
<i>That's the latest from here
in lower Manhattan.</i>

567
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:55,417
<i>Reporting live, I'm Sandra Endo.
Back to you.</i>

568
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:58,420
"Protect and serve" my ass.
Where's my turban?

569
00:38:58,921 --> 00:39:00,923
I'm not talking to anybody without a turban.

570
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:04,093
It's part of my religion, to cover my head
in respect to God. I'm a Sikh.

571
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:05,469
Okay, we'll find your turban.

572
00:39:05,553 --> 00:39:07,847
Not an Arab, by the way,
like your cops called me outside.

573
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,932
Now, no, I don't think you heard that.

574
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,351
There was a lot going on.
You were probably disoriented.

575
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:14,395
- I didn't hear that.
- I heard what I heard.

576
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:16,564
I'll give you all the information you want.

577
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:19,525
I don't need this. I need my turban.
It's part of my religion.

578
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:21,652
- We'll get you your turban.
- We'll find it for you.

579
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:24,155
No, no, no. Not "get me. "
I want my turban now.

580
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:26,949
You just got to start thinking
about the people inside the bank now.

581
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:28,117
It's a dangerous situation.

582
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,619
You got to start telling us
about what's going on inside the bank.

583
00:39:30,703 --> 00:39:33,122
We can talk about this later.
We'll get an officer to come down.

584
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:34,665
You can write a formal complaint.

585
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:37,126
But for now,
we got to deal with this situation.

586
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:39,253
First you beat me,
and now you want my help.

587
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:41,964
You need to start thinking
about your coworkers.

588
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:45,634
I could apologise on behalf of the NYPD,
but that was not us. We are detectives.

589
00:39:45,718 --> 00:39:47,761
- We're gonna try and find out...
- What do you want to know?

590
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:50,472
- How many were there?
- I think there were about four.

591
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:54,310
- How many hostages?
- I don't know how many hostages, 20, 30.

592
00:39:55,728 --> 00:39:59,690
I'm fucking tired of this shit.
What happened to my fucking civil rights?

593
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:02,651
Why can't I go anywhere
without being harassed?

594
00:40:02,735 --> 00:40:04,945
I get thrown out of a bank.
I'm a hostage. I get harassed.

595
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:06,155
I go to the airport.

596
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:08,991
I can't go through security
without a "random" selection.

597
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:10,910
Fucking random, my ass.
I nearly lost my job...

598
00:40:10,993 --> 00:40:13,329
I bet you can get a cab, though.

599
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:16,290
I guess that's one of the perks.

600
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:18,876
Put the ice on your face.

601
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:26,634
<i>"Two buses with full gas tanks.
One jumbo jet with full gas tank</i>

602
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:29,345
<i>"and pilots at JFK,
parked at the end of runway. "</i>

603
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:31,096
<i>They give us until 9:00 pm to do this,</i>

604
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,641
<i>then they kill one hostage every hour

00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:37,186
"Bank is secured with Semtex.
We will demonstrate if necessary. "

606
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:41,148
- Whatever you do, don't give them a jet.
- There's no plane. Maybe a bus. Maybe.

607
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:43,859
Till I talk to them, they get nothing.
Not even a cup of coffee.

608
00:40:43,943 --> 00:40:45,069
For now, we wait.

609
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:47,571
Let's let them wonder
what we're doing, okay?

610
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:49,907
Excuse me, Detectives. This is Arthur Case.

611
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,576
- He's the...
- I'm Chairman, Board of Directors.

612
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,746
- Of the bank. You wanna talk to him?
- Absolutely.

613
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:58,499
Mr Case, how are you?
I'm Detective Frazier.

614
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:00,960
Anything in particular
you think we should know?

615
00:41:01,043 --> 00:41:05,047
No. I just wondered
if I might be of some assistance.

616
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:10,177
- Have they made any demands?
- They want a jet.

617
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:12,471
Oh, I see.

618
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:17,518
Would you like me to arrange one for you?

619
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:26,402
I'm so sorry. I must have misunderstood.

620
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:28,904
That's quite all right, Mr Case.

621
00:41:29,572 --> 00:41:31,365
Where can we reach you
if we need anything?

622
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:33,284
Well, those are my people in there,
you know,

623
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:36,245
and I would like to stay here for a while.
And I won't disturb you.

624
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:38,372
I'll be very quiet right down...
Sergeant Collins!

625
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:41,667
Mr Case, we'll try and keep you posted
as best we can,

626
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,711
but you're gonna have to excuse us
for now, okay?

627
00:41:43,794 --> 00:41:45,462
Right this way, sir.
Thank you very much.

628
00:41:45,546 --> 00:41:46,714
- Absolutely.
- This way, sir.

629
00:41:46,797 --> 00:41:49,425
Thank you very much.
- And thank you all so much.

630
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:50,968
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

631
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:52,553
This way, sir.

632
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:29,298
"Fifty hungry people need food now. "

633
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:41,894
All right.
Are we ready with the listening devices?

634
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:44,188
I'm gonna need 15 minutes
once we get the food.

635
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:46,232
Pizza's the best. No sandwiches.

636
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:48,275
Is she for real?
Are you for real?

637
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:51,654
Well, if we send in, say,
10 pizzas boxes with transmitters,

638
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:54,490
maybe we'll get some conversation
if we give them something to group around.

639
00:42:54,573 --> 00:42:56,534
Give them each a sandwich, it's hit or miss.

640
00:42:56,617 --> 00:42:59,286
They can move around
and I don't have 50 transmitters.

641
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,497
- What's this?
- It's a digital recorder.

642
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,666
You click it, and it'll record for half an hour.

643
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:06,168
- James Bond shit.
- Well, you can get them on Amazon.

644
00:43:06,252 --> 00:43:08,754
- You gonna ask for a hostage?
- He already gave us one, didn't he?

645
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:10,923
I ask for another one,
he says no, then what?

646
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:12,842
No, he knows what he's doing.

647
00:43:12,925 --> 00:43:14,844
He gave us a hostage.
We'll give him some food.

648
00:43:14,927 --> 00:43:17,638
I don't want to get caught bluffing this guy.

649
00:43:22,726 --> 00:43:26,605
Fuck this shit. Look, they want to shoot me
for taking off my mask, they can go ahead.

650
00:43:26,689 --> 00:43:28,274
Do you wanna get us all killed?

651
00:43:28,357 --> 00:43:30,484
You wanna relax?
What the hell is the difference?

652
00:43:30,568 --> 00:43:33,362
They're out there robbing the bank!

653
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:36,031
- Can't you see they fucked him up?
- Shut up.

654
00:43:36,115 --> 00:43:38,075
<i>You think they dressed us like this for fun,
puסeta?</i>

655
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:39,493
- I have no idea
- Please shut up.

656
00:43:39,577 --> 00:43:41,787
...why they made us put on all of this crap.

657
00:43:41,871 --> 00:43:44,832
Probably so when the cops break in
and try to rescue us

658
00:43:44,915 --> 00:43:47,084
- we all get fucking shot.
- Oh, my God!

659
00:43:47,168 --> 00:43:49,378
It's a great plan, but, no, thanks.

660
00:43:49,712 --> 00:43:51,839
I told you to shut up! Leave him!

661
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:56,635
No! Don't do this to me! Please, don't.

662
00:44:00,931 --> 00:44:05,019
I'll do as you say! No! Help! Help!

663
00:44:19,825 --> 00:44:21,619
Please, don't! Don't!

664
00:44:29,126 --> 00:44:31,170
One guy did most of the talking.

665
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:33,631
He told everyone else what to do.

666
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:36,425
- So they were talking amongst themselves?
- We couldn't hear them.

667
00:44:36,509 --> 00:44:39,094
They had us in these rooms.

668
00:44:39,595 --> 00:44:41,805
The doors were locked all the time.

669
00:44:41,889 --> 00:44:43,933
We didn't know what they were doing.

670
00:44:44,016 --> 00:44:46,727
- Did you hear anything they said?
- I have problems with my hearing.

671
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:48,604
- I see.
- I wear hearing aids.

672
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:50,397
- Where are they?
- They're in my ears.

673
00:44:50,481 --> 00:44:51,649
- Let's see.
- Let me see them.

674
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:54,318
- Yeah, let's take a look at them.
- Yeah, it's a hearing aid.

675
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:55,653
That's your other one, there?

676
00:44:55,736 --> 00:44:57,696
What's the red part, there?
What does that do?

677
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,282
They're different colours.
You need two different...

678
00:45:00,366 --> 00:45:02,326
And to distinguish right from left, also.

679
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:03,828
- Distinguish right from left?
- Yeah.

680
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:05,412
Right from wrong.

681
00:45:05,496 --> 00:45:06,956
I don't understand.

682
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:09,416
- Steve?
- I'm sorry?

683
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,876
- I didn't say anything.
- Oh.

684
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,837
Steve. Is that your name? Steve?

685
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,505
Stevie? Steve-O?

686
00:45:14,922 --> 00:45:17,216
- How much are they gonna pay you?
- I'm sorry?

687
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:19,844
- You heard me.
- No, I didn't.

688
00:45:19,927 --> 00:45:23,764
- How much are they going to pay you?
- Who's gonna pay me?

689
00:45:23,848 --> 00:45:26,851
- Were you involved in this robbery?
- Absolutely not.

690
00:45:26,934 --> 00:45:29,186
Were you involved in this situation?

691
00:45:30,271 --> 00:45:32,648
- What situation?
- Don't lie. Don't lie.

692
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:53,836
If he gives us a tip, I'm keeping it.

693
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:55,796
- Put that gun down!
- Check that weapon!

694
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,923
All right, everybody, relax.
Calm down. Calm down.

695
00:45:58,007 --> 00:45:59,717
Calm the fuck down!

696
00:46:02,386 --> 00:46:03,888
How you doing?

697
00:46:05,264 --> 00:46:08,684
I'm Detective Keith Frazier,
Hostage Negotiation Team.

698
00:46:09,476 --> 00:46:10,853
How's it going?

699
00:46:11,729 --> 00:46:15,232
Okay. I hope the pizzas are okay.
They might be a little cold.

700
00:46:15,483 --> 00:46:17,943
Listen, you pick up the phone
anytime you want.

701
00:46:18,027 --> 00:46:19,445
It's a direct line to me.

702
00:46:19,528 --> 00:46:21,405
I would love to talk to you.

703
00:46:27,578 --> 00:46:29,371
Nice talking to you.

704
00:46:58,484 --> 00:47:00,653
Shit. Fucking Russians.

705
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:04,031
Call Operations. See if they can get
a Russian translator over here ASAP.

706
00:47:04,114 --> 00:47:05,866
And get some fucking body bags.

707
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:07,743
I hope you know what you're doing.

708
00:47:07,827 --> 00:47:10,663
Because if my guys got to shoot it out
with those fucking savages...

709
00:47:10,746 --> 00:47:12,456
Okay, okay, okay. Mitch?

710
00:47:12,873 --> 00:47:14,583
Check with either one of the hostages.

711
00:47:14,667 --> 00:47:18,879
Find out if they heard any Russian
or Russian accents when they were in there.

712
00:47:18,963 --> 00:47:20,464
We'll be all right.

713
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:39,733
No!

714
00:47:42,486 --> 00:47:44,113
Down on the floor!

715
00:47:51,787 --> 00:47:54,290
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go. Let's go.

716
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:57,793
Stop crying! Shut the fuck up!

717
00:48:01,172 --> 00:48:04,967
Get in there! Sit down! Put your masks on!

718
00:48:05,718 --> 00:48:08,053
Come on, let's go. Come on, boobs.

719
00:48:08,137 --> 00:48:11,765
- "Boobs"? Who the fuck you talking to?
- Let's go. You heard me! Shut the fuck up!

720
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:14,143
- Why?
- Move that fat ass! Let's go! Come on!

721
00:48:14,226 --> 00:48:15,519
"Fat ass"? Are you kidding me?

722
00:48:15,603 --> 00:48:19,523
If you don't shut the fuck up,
I'm gonna put my foot up your fat ass!

723
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:24,862
Put your masks on!

724
00:48:24,945 --> 00:48:26,906
Put your hands on the ground!

725
00:48:26,989 --> 00:48:28,491
Okay, okay.

726
00:48:29,158 --> 00:48:31,494
On the floor. Hands are on the floor.

727
00:48:36,207 --> 00:48:37,791
Masks on!

728
00:48:38,167 --> 00:48:40,211
Put your hands on the ground!

729
00:48:41,754 --> 00:48:43,130
Come on, boobs, let's go.

730
00:48:43,214 --> 00:48:45,549
Oh, shit. Sit down! Sit down!

731
00:48:54,892 --> 00:48:57,019
She was on line in front of me.

732
00:48:57,478 --> 00:48:59,814
He was the teller on my line.

733
00:48:59,897 --> 00:49:03,734
This guy was to my right
and his kid was in front of him.

734
00:49:03,818 --> 00:49:05,903
He was playing with a video game.

735
00:49:05,986 --> 00:49:07,446
I remember her.

736
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:09,907
- Why do you remember her?
- Great tits.

737
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:15,830
- You remember seeing any of them after?
- Yeah, I saw her one time afterwards.

738
00:49:15,913 --> 00:49:19,583
- How are you sure you saw her again?
- I could see under the suit.

739
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,585
Can't hide quality like that.

740
00:49:21,669 --> 00:49:24,171
This guy, he almost got us all killed.

741
00:49:24,255 --> 00:49:25,339
How?

742
00:49:25,422 --> 00:49:27,883
They put eight or nine of us
in an office for a while.

743
00:49:27,967 --> 00:49:32,012
This guy took off his mask
and was talking like he wasn't afraid.

744
00:49:32,096 --> 00:49:34,557
"I don't have to wear this damn mask,"
you know?

745
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,727
So, they come in, pull him out of the room
and smack him around a little.

746
00:49:39,812 --> 00:49:41,981
- You see him again after that?
- No.

747
00:49:42,773 --> 00:49:44,817
- Was he okay?
- Seemed fine.

748
00:49:46,026 --> 00:49:47,236
You...

749
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:52,241
- You recognise anyone else from that room?
- I can't be sure about the others.

750
00:49:52,324 --> 00:49:53,534
No one?

751
00:49:54,201 --> 00:49:57,037
- Why don't you keep looking?
- You know, I was terrified.

752
00:49:57,121 --> 00:49:58,455
What about before it began?

753
00:49:58,539 --> 00:50:00,875
You didn't look around
while you were waiting in line?

754
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:03,627
I was talking to my girlfriend on the phone.

755
00:50:07,256 --> 00:50:09,300
You wanna take another picture?

756
00:50:09,592 --> 00:50:11,969
I could bend over and pick up a pencil.

757
00:50:12,553 --> 00:50:13,804
Whatever.

758
00:50:14,513 --> 00:50:15,806
This guy.

759
00:50:16,724 --> 00:50:17,975
Asshole.

760
00:50:39,663 --> 00:50:41,832
What the fuck? This ain't Russian.

761
00:50:43,334 --> 00:50:45,044
No? What the hell is it?

762
00:50:45,503 --> 00:50:47,838
It's not Polish. Not Hungarian.

763
00:50:48,172 --> 00:50:50,341
Bulgarian, maybe.

764
00:50:51,091 --> 00:50:53,344
It's Central European. Sort of.

765
00:50:53,427 --> 00:50:55,846
That's it?
I mean, you're the language expert.

766
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:57,348
What? No.

767
00:50:58,182 --> 00:51:00,226
- What do you think?
- Well, okay.

768
00:51:00,684 --> 00:51:02,019
Well, this is New York City.

769
00:51:02,102 --> 00:51:03,979
Somebody on the street
must know what it is.

770
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,397
Probably the hot-dog man.

771
00:51:05,481 --> 00:51:08,484
Berk, play that over the speaker for me.
Excuse me.

772
00:51:11,946 --> 00:51:13,239
Excuse me!

773
00:51:13,531 --> 00:51:17,243
Does anybody know
what language they're speaking? Anybody?

774
00:51:17,326 --> 00:51:18,619
Yo, my man.

775
00:51:18,702 --> 00:51:21,247
Hey, Phil, let that guy through. Come on.

776
00:51:25,751 --> 00:51:28,796
- You know what language they're speaking?
- Yeah, they're speaking Albanian.

777
00:51:28,879 --> 00:51:31,173
- Albanian?
- Albanian. From Albania.

778
00:51:34,844 --> 00:51:36,387
What am I doing here?

779
00:51:38,764 --> 00:51:40,558
Yo, am I getting arrested for something?

780
00:51:40,641 --> 00:51:43,561
No, you're not getting arrested.
Come on. Come on.

781
00:51:44,311 --> 00:51:45,437
Whoa.

782
00:51:46,021 --> 00:51:49,567
- Okay. What are they saying?
- I have no idea what they're saying.

783
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:51,443
You got no idea?
I thought you said you spoke Albanian.

784
00:51:51,527 --> 00:51:52,611
No. I never said I speak Albanian.

785
00:51:52,695 --> 00:51:53,863
You said you spoke Albanian.

786
00:51:53,946 --> 00:51:55,072
I never said I speak Albanian.

787
00:51:55,156 --> 00:51:56,574
Well, how do you know it's Albanian?

788
00:51:56,657 --> 00:51:58,659
My ex-wife and her parents are Albanian.

789
00:51:58,742 --> 00:52:01,203
Her parents couldn't speak English for shit.

790
00:52:01,287 --> 00:52:02,663
I have no idea what they're saying,

791
00:52:02,746 --> 00:52:05,416
but I'll tell you right now
that the language is 100% Albanian.

792
00:52:05,499 --> 00:52:07,001
- 100%?
- 100%.

793
00:52:07,084 --> 00:52:09,920
Call the Albanian Consulate.
See if they can get somebody over here

794
00:52:10,004 --> 00:52:11,797
to translate this for us. Make it happen fast.

795
00:52:11,881 --> 00:52:13,549
Okay, you hang out
in the back for me, okay?

796
00:52:13,632 --> 00:52:15,134
Oh, man, not again.

797
00:52:15,885 --> 00:52:19,388
Van was stolen two days ago, but it's clean.
No prints.

798
00:52:19,471 --> 00:52:20,931
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

799
00:52:21,849 --> 00:52:23,100
Albanian?

800
00:52:23,184 --> 00:52:26,353
My man, like I told you, 100% Albanian.

801
00:52:28,647 --> 00:52:30,024
Undeniable.

802
00:52:42,995 --> 00:52:45,164
- Hey.
- Thanks.

803
00:53:10,773 --> 00:53:13,025
<i>Yo, yo, yo.
There go that motherfucker right there.</i>

804
00:53:13,108 --> 00:53:15,736
<i>Hey, yo, you thought you was gonna
get away with that shit, didn't you?</i>

805
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,321
How does this game work?

806
00:53:17,404 --> 00:53:21,534
You get points for doing dirt,
like jacking a car or selling crack.

807
00:53:21,867 --> 00:53:25,329
And you lose points
if someone jacks your ride or shoots you.

808
00:53:25,871 --> 00:53:27,248
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

809
00:53:27,331 --> 00:53:29,917
<i>Take that! Take this! What? What? What?</i>

810
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,002
<i>Talk shit now! I don't hear you!</i>

811
00:53:32,086 --> 00:53:34,630
<i>Eat this! Eat that! Eat this! Eat that!</i>

812
00:53:34,839 --> 00:53:37,174
<i>You're gone, baby! You're dead! Bye-bye!</i>

813
00:53:37,424 --> 00:53:38,551
Jesus!

814
00:53:39,218 --> 00:53:40,928
What's the point of this?

815
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:44,473
Like my man 50 says,
"Get rich or die tryin'."

816
00:53:45,224 --> 00:53:48,144
Yo, you'd get mad points
for knocking over the bank.

817
00:53:48,227 --> 00:53:52,231
- You think that's cool?
- Hell, yeah. You trying to get paid, too.

818
00:53:56,235 --> 00:53:59,321
Finish your slice.
I'll take you back to your father.

819
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:03,075
I got to talk to him about this game.

820
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:13,294
- Is it good?
- No doubt.

821
00:54:16,881 --> 00:54:18,340
It's gonna be okay.

822
00:54:19,383 --> 00:54:20,467
Cool.

823
00:54:21,135 --> 00:54:22,595
You'll be home soon.

824
00:54:23,262 --> 00:54:24,722
That's whassup.

825
00:54:30,102 --> 00:54:31,270
- Sir?
- Yeah.

826
00:54:31,353 --> 00:54:33,355
- No luck with the Albanian Consulate.
- What do you mean?

827
00:54:33,439 --> 00:54:35,941
I couldn't tell what the guy
was talking about. I think he wanted money.

828
00:54:36,025 --> 00:54:38,068
And I tried the State Department.
That takes a month.

829
00:54:38,152 --> 00:54:39,278
Okay.

830
00:54:39,653 --> 00:54:41,530
- Call her.
- Are you crazy?

831
00:54:41,614 --> 00:54:43,949
- I hate that bitch. Come on.
- You said she speaks Albanian, right?

832
00:54:44,033 --> 00:54:46,285
- Yeah, she was born there.
- Call her.

833
00:54:46,368 --> 00:54:48,037
I'm gonna regret this.

834
00:55:28,661 --> 00:55:30,704
- Who's Detective Frazier?
- Right here.

835
00:55:30,788 --> 00:55:33,374
- I have Ilina Maria over here.
- Miritia.

836
00:55:33,457 --> 00:55:34,917
- Oh, how you doing?
- Hello.

837
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,252
How you doing?

838
00:55:36,961 --> 00:55:39,839
- What's this?
- Parking tickets. You can fix them?

839
00:55:41,841 --> 00:55:44,051
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

840
00:55:44,343 --> 00:55:46,929
Can you listen to this
and tell us what they're saying?

841
00:55:47,012 --> 00:55:48,806
You can't smoke in here.

842
00:55:51,851 --> 00:55:53,227
Shit. Go ahead.

843
00:56:03,821 --> 00:56:06,365
What's so funny?
What, you know what they're talking about?

844
00:56:06,448 --> 00:56:09,535
I know what they're talking about.
I even know who it is.

845
00:56:09,618 --> 00:56:11,704
You know who it is?
You mean you know their names?

846
00:56:11,787 --> 00:56:13,539
- Who? I mean, who is it?
- Parking tickets?

847
00:56:13,622 --> 00:56:16,208
- They're taken care of. Who is it?
- It's Enver Hoxha.

848
00:56:16,292 --> 00:56:18,961
- Who?
- He was the president of Albania.

849
00:56:19,378 --> 00:56:20,546
Wait.

850
00:56:20,629 --> 00:56:23,507
You're telling me the former president
of Albania is in there robbing a bank?

851
00:56:23,591 --> 00:56:24,842
Enver Hoxha's dead.

852
00:56:24,925 --> 00:56:28,095
That's a tape of him discussing
how Albanian people are great people.

853
00:56:28,179 --> 00:56:30,806
They are immortal people. I wouldn't worry.

854
00:56:32,516 --> 00:56:34,560
It's a tape. You're sure about that?

855
00:56:34,685 --> 00:56:36,854
I had to listen to all this nonsense
in school.

856
00:56:36,937 --> 00:56:41,233
"Communism is great. Capitalism is evil.
Lenin, Marx, blah, blah, blah. "

857
00:56:41,317 --> 00:56:43,235
It's Enver Hoxha. It's a tape.

858
00:56:43,319 --> 00:56:47,072
Okay. Okay, well,
Officer, you can take her home.

859
00:56:47,156 --> 00:56:50,659
And do me a favour, huh?
Watch where you park next time, okay?

860
00:56:57,666 --> 00:56:59,210
So, they're playing tapes for us now.

861
00:56:59,293 --> 00:57:00,753
They knew we were gonna bug them.

862
00:57:00,836 --> 00:57:03,506
Yeah, you're damn right they knew we were
gonna bug them. And they knew how.

863
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:05,549
What makes it even worse,
they wanted us to bug them

864
00:57:05,633 --> 00:57:07,134
so they could send us
on a wild goose chase.

865
00:57:07,218 --> 00:57:10,095
Last time I had my johnson
pulled that good, it cost me $5.

866
00:57:10,179 --> 00:57:11,263
$5?

867
00:57:12,348 --> 00:57:14,058
Yeah, Tijuana. Don't ask.

868
00:57:15,935 --> 00:57:18,062
Look at the... Oh, fuck that.

869
00:59:12,259 --> 00:59:14,803
- Detective Frazier. Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

870
00:59:14,887 --> 00:59:16,138
This is Madeleine White.

871
00:59:16,222 --> 00:59:18,682
- How do you do, Miss White?
- It's an honour, Detective.

872
00:59:18,766 --> 00:59:21,352
Miss White may be able to assist you.

873
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:24,522
Good. Good. What do you have in mind?

874
00:59:24,605 --> 00:59:28,234
She has a certain amount of influence
in these matters

875
00:59:28,317 --> 00:59:30,945
for reasons which I can't share with you.

876
00:59:33,113 --> 00:59:34,740
What are you trying to say, sir?

877
00:59:34,824 --> 00:59:37,993
What the Mayor means
is that there are matters at stake here

878
00:59:38,077 --> 00:59:40,913
that are a little bit above your pay grade.
No offence.

879
00:59:40,996 --> 00:59:43,040
And he's offering to help you.

880
00:59:43,916 --> 00:59:47,920
Well, why don't you just tell the Mayor
to raise my pay grade to the proper level

881
00:59:48,003 --> 00:59:49,421
and problem solved.

882
00:59:49,505 --> 00:59:51,882
From what I hear, that would have happened
a long time ago

883
00:59:51,966 --> 00:59:55,261
if you'd been a little bit more diplomatic.
But we can certainly discuss it.

884
00:59:55,344 --> 00:59:58,389
Look, I'm kidding. I mean,
I make First Grade when I make First Grade.

885
00:59:58,472 --> 01:00:01,267
You want to speed that up,
I'm not gonna talk you out of it.

886
01:00:01,350 --> 01:00:04,770
Then there's also the matter of $140,000
that seems to have walked away

887
01:00:04,854 --> 01:00:06,689
from the Madrugada cheque-cashing bust.

888
01:00:06,772 --> 01:00:07,940
Oh, I see.

889
01:00:09,567 --> 01:00:11,861
Well, I had nothing to do with that.

890
01:00:12,653 --> 01:00:14,989
Yeah, Collins, we got snipers
in the windows here.

891
01:00:15,072 --> 01:00:17,741
We got guys in the building next door.
Guys up on the roof.

892
01:00:17,825 --> 01:00:19,952
We're trying to get the blueprints
for the bank

893
01:00:20,035 --> 01:00:23,789
so we can figure out the ventilator shaft.
Maybe we can come down.

894
01:00:27,126 --> 01:00:29,628
<i>Well?
Is this the President of Albania?</i>

895
01:00:29,879 --> 01:00:31,714
- Speaking.
- Pretty funny.

896
01:00:31,964 --> 01:00:34,967
- You shouldn't eavesdrop on people.
- Well, you better get used to it, pal.

897
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:37,094
There's not gonna be much privacy
where you're going.

898
01:00:37,178 --> 01:00:38,304
<i>You're damn right.</i>

899
01:00:38,387 --> 01:00:41,473
This time next week,
I'll be sucking down piסa coladas

900
01:00:41,557 --> 01:00:44,560
in a hot tub with six girls
named Amber and Tiffany.

901
01:00:44,643 --> 01:00:47,813
More like taking a shower with two guys
named Jamal and Jesus,

902
01:00:47,897 --> 01:00:50,483
if you know what I mean.
And here's the bad news,

903
01:00:50,566 --> 01:00:53,652
that thing you're sucking on,
it's not a piסa colada.

904
01:00:56,071 --> 01:01:00,034
<i>- Maybe you like that kind of thing, huh?
- You really want to piss me off.</i>

905
01:01:00,117 --> 01:01:01,452
All right, here's where we stand.

906
01:01:01,535 --> 01:01:04,288
I don't need
your fucking status report, Serpico.

907
01:01:04,371 --> 01:01:05,956
I tell you where things stand.

908
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,375
<i>- Sure, sure. I just meant...
- Here's where things stand.</i>

909
01:01:08,459 --> 01:01:10,294
You're getting me what I asked you for.

910
01:01:10,377 --> 01:01:12,254
You'll have it ready in the time I gave you

911
01:01:12,338 --> 01:01:15,633
or you'll sit by and you'll watch me do
just what I said I would do. Clear?

912
01:01:15,716 --> 01:01:17,551
Very clear.
I'm trying to get you what you want.

913
01:01:17,635 --> 01:01:19,428
But you got to understand this.

914
01:01:19,512 --> 01:01:23,390
You know, it's not like the City of New York
has 747 s waiting around for days like today.

915
01:01:23,474 --> 01:01:25,851
I understand that if you don't get
my plane ready,

916
01:01:25,935 --> 01:01:28,270
<i>- then you might as well send a hearse.
- Please.</i>

917
01:01:28,354 --> 01:01:30,815
<i>Let's focus on how we can both
get what we want, all right?</i>

918
01:01:30,898 --> 01:01:33,317
Hey! You're not listening.

919
01:01:35,152 --> 01:01:38,781
You get me what I want, I won't kill anyone.

920
01:01:39,323 --> 01:01:41,408
All right. I'm on it. I'm on it.

921
01:01:42,034 --> 01:01:44,411
Let's just try to keep everybody calm, okay?

922
01:01:44,495 --> 01:01:47,289
- Don't I sound calm to you?
- Yeah, you do.

923
01:01:50,292 --> 01:01:51,544
<i>Yeah, you do.</i>

924
01:02:45,598 --> 01:02:48,434
- So, Mr Damerjian...
- Damerjian.

925
01:02:48,517 --> 01:02:50,603
- Damerjian. Is that Albanian?
- Just call me Kenneth.

926
01:02:50,686 --> 01:02:52,938
- Kenneth?
- Is that Albanian or...

927
01:02:53,022 --> 01:02:54,523
It's Armenian.

928
01:02:55,274 --> 01:02:56,901
What's the difference?

929
01:02:57,443 --> 01:02:59,528
Detective, I was born in Queens.

930
01:03:00,446 --> 01:03:03,657
I've never been to Armenia, Albania.
I went surfing in Australia once.

931
01:03:03,741 --> 01:03:05,326
Can I have a glass of water?

932
01:03:05,409 --> 01:03:07,786
- Are you thirsty?
- My throat's parched.

933
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:09,455
- I'm not nervous.
- Your throat's parched?

934
01:03:09,538 --> 01:03:11,290
- My throat's parched.
- His throat is parched.

935
01:03:11,373 --> 01:03:13,918
- I just want a glass of water.
- Oh, shit!

936
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,337
When you start telling us
what really happened...

937
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:18,297
- I just want a glass of water.
- His throat is parched.

938
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:20,007
- Here. You want some coffee?
- No, that's all right.

939
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:21,342
- I don't drink that stuff.
- No, go ahead.

940
01:03:21,425 --> 01:03:22,593
Did you know they were robbing the bank?

941
01:03:22,676 --> 01:03:24,845
I didn't know they were robbing the bank
until they pulled a gun in my face.

942
01:03:24,929 --> 01:03:26,430
Is that why you held the door open
for them?

943
01:03:26,514 --> 01:03:27,640
How do you know they robbed the bank?

944
01:03:27,723 --> 01:03:29,016
Because they pulled a gun in my face...

945
01:03:29,099 --> 01:03:30,434
That doesn't mean they were
robbing the bank.

946
01:03:30,518 --> 01:03:32,144
Did they take money?
Did you see them take money?

947
01:03:32,228 --> 01:03:35,856
I was in a bank and I was locked up
for who knows how long.

948
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:38,651
- Okay.
- Tied up in a room. I saw you see me.

949
01:03:38,734 --> 01:03:40,110
You saw me see you?

950
01:03:40,194 --> 01:03:41,529
- Is that what you just said?
- Yeah.

951
01:03:41,612 --> 01:03:43,989
I was locked up in the room.
You saw me gagged when you came in.

952
01:03:44,073 --> 01:03:46,700
Listen, I can't work miracles over here.
I'm gonna need more time.

953
01:03:46,784 --> 01:03:49,578
Well, perhaps if you'd use the time
that I gave you more efficiently,

954
01:03:49,662 --> 01:03:51,163
you wouldn't be having this problem.

955
01:03:51,247 --> 01:03:54,333
<i>- What do you want me to say?
- That my plane is ready.</i>

956
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:56,126
<i>Okay, listen.</i>

957
01:03:57,336 --> 01:04:01,006
I promise you, as God is my witness,
I'm working on it as hard as I can.

958
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:02,842
It's just gonna take a few more hours.

959
01:04:02,925 --> 01:04:04,426
Why should I give you any more time?

960
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:06,846
<i>Well, it's simple. You give me more time,
you get what you want.</i>

961
01:04:06,929 --> 01:04:09,014
<i>You don't give me the time,
you don't get what you want.</i>

962
01:04:09,098 --> 01:04:10,641
You got nothing to lose.

963
01:04:13,435 --> 01:04:15,563
Meanwhile, we'll send in some more food.

964
01:04:15,646 --> 01:04:18,440
I got a question for you.
You get it right, I give you more time.

965
01:04:18,524 --> 01:04:21,068
<i>- And?
- You know what happens if you don't.</i>

966
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:24,655
Which weighs more?

967
01:04:25,865 --> 01:04:29,535
All the trains that pass through
Grand Central Station in a year,

968
01:04:30,244 --> 01:04:33,789
or the trees cut down to print
all US currency in circulation?

969
01:04:34,373 --> 01:04:36,876
Here's a hint. It's a trick question.

970
01:04:39,587 --> 01:04:42,089
What the hell is that? Playing games now?

971
01:04:42,173 --> 01:04:43,340
It's the trains.

972
01:04:43,424 --> 01:04:46,427
US money isn't printed on paper at all.
It's cotton.

973
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:48,137
- Yeah, I heard that.
- Yeah, that's right.

974
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:49,555
- Okay.
- So no trees were cut down.

975
01:04:49,638 --> 01:04:52,099
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. 100%.

976
01:04:52,308 --> 01:04:53,392
Okay.

977
01:04:58,439 --> 01:04:59,732
I got it.

978
01:04:59,815 --> 01:05:02,818
- Wait a second. Wait a second.
- I'll call you back.

979
01:05:06,739 --> 01:05:08,991
It's a trap. They both weigh the same.

980
01:05:09,074 --> 01:05:11,494
Tell him they both weigh the same.
They both weigh nothing.

981
01:05:11,577 --> 01:05:13,579
They both weigh nothing
or they both weigh the same?

982
01:05:13,662 --> 01:05:14,788
Tell him they both weigh the same.

983
01:05:14,872 --> 01:05:16,457
Tell him they both weigh the same.
Do it now.

984
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:18,709
They both weigh the same. Got it.

985
01:05:22,338 --> 01:05:25,090
- Well?
- They both weigh the same.

986
01:05:25,174 --> 01:05:27,134
This time, send sandwiches.

987
01:05:28,052 --> 01:05:31,013
That's pretty good. This guy's nuts.

988
01:05:31,096 --> 01:05:33,432
He said, "Grand Central Station. "

989
01:05:33,682 --> 01:05:36,352
Grand Central Terminal is the train station.

990
01:05:36,435 --> 01:05:39,104
- Grand Central Station is the post office.
- Is the post office.

991
01:05:39,188 --> 01:05:40,481
He's wrong.
Who's wrong?

992
01:05:40,564 --> 01:05:43,776
Perp One.
Trains don't pass through Grand Central.

993
01:05:44,485 --> 01:05:45,861
It's the last stop for every train.

994
01:05:45,945 --> 01:05:48,781
- What about the subway? They run through.
- Metro-North goes there.

995
01:05:48,864 --> 01:05:50,783
- How the fuck do you know?
- Metro-North goes there!

996
01:05:50,866 --> 01:05:52,326
No. Metro-North starts there.

997
01:05:52,409 --> 01:05:54,495
What are you guys talking about?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

998
01:05:54,578 --> 01:05:57,915
- Metro-North goes through!
- Let's just get the sandwiches.

999
01:05:58,249 --> 01:06:01,836
- Metro-North...
- Deal is, he said, "Passes through. "

1000
01:06:01,919 --> 01:06:04,004
Yeah, but the Metro-North goes up
there, though.

1001
01:06:04,088 --> 01:06:06,465
Look, shut up. It doesn't matter, anyway.

1002
01:06:06,549 --> 01:06:07,842
<i>I know what he meant.</i>

1003
01:06:07,925 --> 01:06:09,552
<i>What he said is one thing,
but what he meant is another.</i>

1004
01:06:09,635 --> 01:06:11,011
<i>Yeah.
That's always a problem, isn't it?</i>

1005
01:06:11,095 --> 01:06:12,179
<i>Sandwiches.</i>

1006
01:06:12,263 --> 01:06:13,848
<i>I'm on it, I'm on it.</i>

1007
01:06:15,975 --> 01:06:19,145
You know, right now I could go for
a nice kosher hot dog and a beer.

1008
01:06:19,228 --> 01:06:21,355
I had Met tickets tonight.
And Pedro's pitching!

1009
01:06:21,438 --> 01:06:23,149
They're gonna get their asses
kicked anyway.

1010
01:06:23,232 --> 01:06:25,943
Tell me about it. I'm better off here.
I'm glad they didn't separate us.

1011
01:06:26,026 --> 01:06:28,696
- Do you think they're terrorists?
- They're robbers, not terrorists.

1012
01:06:28,779 --> 01:06:30,447
How do you know? They could be Al-Qaeda.

1013
01:06:30,531 --> 01:06:32,366
Trust me. I've studied these things.

1014
01:06:32,449 --> 01:06:34,201
- What are you, Mossad?
- No. I was a lawyer.

1015
01:06:34,285 --> 01:06:37,413
Now I teach courses at Columbia Law
on genocide, slave labour,

1016
01:06:37,496 --> 01:06:39,290
<i>- war reparation claims.
- Mira.</i>

1017
01:06:39,373 --> 01:06:42,751
- Can I sue anybody when this is over?
- Oh, sure. Go nuts.

1018
01:06:43,043 --> 01:06:44,420
Go meshuga.

1019
01:06:47,381 --> 01:06:49,592
Now that's a good looking shithole.

1020
01:06:59,685 --> 01:07:01,395
- Hello?
Hey, baby, how you doing?

1021
01:07:01,479 --> 01:07:03,481
<i>Baby, I'm worried about you.
You coming home?</i>

1022
01:07:03,564 --> 01:07:05,065
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Soon.

1023
01:07:05,149 --> 01:07:07,651
It's gonna be a long night, though,
so don't wait up for me.

1024
01:07:07,735 --> 01:07:09,236
Why don't you let me come down there?

1025
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,906
Because I don't want to be
distracted by you, that's why.

1026
01:07:11,989 --> 01:07:15,242
<i>Well, if you're still there when I come
on duty in the morning, you will see me.</i>

1027
01:07:15,326 --> 01:07:18,412
<i>- I cannot wait. I cannot wait.
- So, how you doing?</i>

1028
01:07:18,746 --> 01:07:21,457
It's all right. We got a couple
of the hostages out. Thanks a lot.

1029
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:25,002
- No, no. How you doing?
- I'm doing okay. I'm doing all right.

1030
01:07:25,085 --> 01:07:28,797
<i>Oh, I saw the Mayor on TV. He said
you're doing a great job. I saw you, too.</i>

1031
01:07:28,881 --> 01:07:30,508
<i>- You saw me on TV?
- Yeah.</i>

1032
01:07:30,591 --> 01:07:33,093
<i>- How'd I look?
- You looked good, baby. Real good.</i>

1033
01:07:33,177 --> 01:07:36,055
- All right, listen. I got to go.
- All right. Hey.

1034
01:07:36,263 --> 01:07:39,308
- Keep your head down.
- All right, I will. Love you.

1035
01:07:40,476 --> 01:07:41,685
Come on.

1036
01:07:44,605 --> 01:07:47,149
So, are we clear about the ground rules?

1037
01:07:47,775 --> 01:07:50,611
- There's no need to worry, Detective.
- I get paid to worry, okay?

1038
01:07:50,694 --> 01:07:52,321
I just need you to look me in the eye

1039
01:07:52,404 --> 01:07:56,075
and make me believe that you understand
everything we talked about.

1040
01:07:56,158 --> 01:07:57,618
- I understand.
- Okay.

1041
01:08:02,957 --> 01:08:05,125
Someone here wants to talk to you.

1042
01:08:07,378 --> 01:08:08,879
- Hello?
- Who is this?

1043
01:08:09,004 --> 01:08:11,006
<i>Let's not get into any names.</i>

1044
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:13,509
<i>- What matters is what I can offer you.
- And what's that?</i>

1045
01:08:13,592 --> 01:08:16,095
Well, if I can be assured
that certain interests are protected,

1046
01:08:16,178 --> 01:08:18,389
I might be able to help you get
what you came for.

1047
01:08:18,472 --> 01:08:19,723
I doubt that.

1048
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:23,811
Tell me about these interests
that you are trying to protect.

1049
01:08:23,894 --> 01:08:25,563
Why don't you let me worry about that?

1050
01:08:25,646 --> 01:08:29,150
Now, what is it you were hoping to get out
of all this?

1051
01:08:29,358 --> 01:08:31,318
- Rich, of course.
- Of course.

1052
01:08:31,402 --> 01:08:33,821
But you may have bitten off
more than you can chew.

1053
01:08:33,904 --> 01:08:36,740
<i>- How?
- I can't discuss that on the phone.</i>

1054
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:39,076
- You work for the bank?
- No.

1055
01:08:39,702 --> 01:08:41,370
<i>And you're not a cop.</i>

1056
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:43,164
That's right.

1057
01:08:44,874 --> 01:08:46,250
Come on in.

1058
01:08:53,465 --> 01:08:55,009
You got 10 minutes. No more.

1059
01:08:55,092 --> 01:08:56,844
If you're not out
before the lights come back on,

1060
01:08:56,927 --> 01:08:58,512
you can stay inside until this thing is over.

1061
01:08:58,596 --> 01:09:01,056
- You don't need to threaten me.
- That's not a threat, lady, but this is.

1062
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:04,268
I know this game is a mile over my head,
but I'm telling you, if you fuck me over...

1063
01:09:04,351 --> 01:09:06,520
I got where I am by collecting friends,
not enemies.

1064
01:09:06,604 --> 01:09:08,105
Trust me, okay?

1065
01:09:08,939 --> 01:09:10,441
You're on your own.

1066
01:09:36,258 --> 01:09:38,427
What makes you think
I need help?

1067
01:09:39,553 --> 01:09:41,972
Well,
the hundred people outside, for starters.

1068
01:09:42,056 --> 01:09:43,390
It's not a problem.

1069
01:09:43,474 --> 01:09:46,519
And they're fuelling
your jet right now as we speak.

1070
01:09:47,394 --> 01:09:49,480
Come on. You're not that stupid.

1071
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:52,233
Here's what I'm thinking.

1072
01:09:52,316 --> 01:09:54,902
If you give up now,
I can ensure that you'll serve the minimum.

1073
01:09:54,985 --> 01:09:57,154
I'm thinking three years,
four years at the most.

1074
01:09:57,238 --> 01:09:58,322
You can arrange that?

1075
01:09:58,405 --> 01:10:00,449
Well, you haven't hurt anyone
or stolen anything,

1076
01:10:00,533 --> 01:10:02,743
so yes, as a matter of fact, I can.

1077
01:10:03,369 --> 01:10:06,247
- It's not good enough.
- Well, I wasn't finished.

1078
01:10:06,413 --> 01:10:09,333
When you get out, you'll have $2 million.

1079
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:11,919
Will I? How?

1080
01:10:12,002 --> 01:10:15,172
We'll put it someplace safe and it'll be
waiting for you when you get out.

1081
01:10:15,256 --> 01:10:16,465
Thanks.

1082
01:10:17,258 --> 01:10:18,801
But no, thanks.

1083
01:10:18,884 --> 01:10:22,096
Oh, come on. I made you such a sweet offer.

1084
01:10:22,179 --> 01:10:24,598
I really don't think you have much
in the way of alternatives.

1085
01:10:24,682 --> 01:10:28,644
Why don't you talk to me about these
interests that you're in here to protect?

1086
01:10:28,727 --> 01:10:30,437
- I'm afraid I can't.
- I can.

1087
01:10:30,521 --> 01:10:32,231
Let me tell you a story.

1088
01:10:34,733 --> 01:10:39,071
During World War II, there was an American
working for a bank in Switzerland.

1089
01:10:40,281 --> 01:10:42,783
<i>Now, I don't need to tell you
that this period in history</i>

1090
01:10:42,867 --> 01:10:45,786
<i>was rife with opportunity
for people of low morals.</i>

1091
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:47,580
<i>People like this man.</i>

1092
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:52,626
<i>He used his position with the Nazis
to enrich himself while all around him</i>

1093
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:55,754
<i>people were being stripped
of everything they owned.</i>

1094
01:10:56,797 --> 01:11:00,801
Then he used his blood money
to start a bank.

1095
01:11:00,885 --> 01:11:02,011
Now,

1096
01:11:03,637 --> 01:11:06,765
does this sound like
it might be the man you work for?

1097
01:11:07,391 --> 01:11:10,019
<i>Or am I just whistling Dixie out of my ass?</i>

1098
01:11:10,644 --> 01:11:13,230
- I believe we understand each other.
- Good.

1099
01:11:14,732 --> 01:11:16,650
So, what the hell can you do for me

1100
01:11:16,734 --> 01:11:20,404
since I clearly know more than you do,
and I've planned this to perfection?

1101
01:11:20,488 --> 01:11:24,700
Believe me, if I need to,
I can change your entire programme.

1102
01:11:24,783 --> 01:11:26,869
So, the sooner
that you stop being my problem

1103
01:11:26,952 --> 01:11:30,456
and you start becoming my solution,
the better off you'll be.

1104
01:11:30,831 --> 01:11:33,042
- What is it you want?
- Two minutes.

1105
01:11:33,125 --> 01:11:36,462
The safety deposit box room.
I just need to go to one box.

1106
01:11:38,297 --> 01:11:39,840
Looking for this?

1107
01:11:41,175 --> 01:11:44,053
This could be very embarrassing
to your employer.

1108
01:11:44,637 --> 01:11:46,806
He should have destroyed this
a long time ago.

1109
01:11:46,889 --> 01:11:48,849
He didn't, so now it's mine.

1110
01:11:51,268 --> 01:11:54,230
Now, if the day ever comes
where I have to stand before a judge

1111
01:11:54,313 --> 01:11:56,190
and account for what I did here,

1112
01:11:56,273 --> 01:11:59,485
you and your boss
will do whatever it takes to help me.

1113
01:12:00,444 --> 01:12:02,863
You get out of here with that envelope,

1114
01:12:03,364 --> 01:12:05,533
and we'll pay you a lot of money.

1115
01:12:05,866 --> 01:12:07,159
I'll keep that in mind.

1116
01:12:07,243 --> 01:12:10,162
You're not gonna tell me how you're
planning to get out of here, are you?

1117
01:12:10,246 --> 01:12:13,457
I'm gonna walk right out the front door.
Anything else?

1118
01:12:13,541 --> 01:12:16,210
- How did you know about all this?
- Doesn't matter.

1119
01:12:16,293 --> 01:12:19,713
Fact is, all lies, all evil deeds, they stink.

1120
01:12:20,172 --> 01:12:23,509
You can cover them up for a while,
but they don't go away.

1121
01:12:23,592 --> 01:12:25,886
- Murder will out?
- Precisely.

1122
01:12:26,762 --> 01:12:29,098
Well, I still don't get what you're
doing here.

1123
01:12:29,181 --> 01:12:30,266
Really?

1124
01:12:31,809 --> 01:12:32,935
Good.

1125
01:12:37,356 --> 01:12:38,482
So, we spoke.

1126
01:12:38,566 --> 01:12:40,276
Oh, no. You're gonna have to give me
more than that.

1127
01:12:40,359 --> 01:12:42,027
- Let me have this window, fellows.
- Yes, sir.

1128
01:12:42,111 --> 01:12:44,905
I told him that, well,
since he hadn't killed anyone,

1129
01:12:44,989 --> 01:12:47,950
it wasn't too late to surrender
and get off with a lighter sentence.

1130
01:12:48,033 --> 01:12:49,118
And?

1131
01:12:49,827 --> 01:12:51,745
And that was basically it.

1132
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:55,124
You know, I don't ordinarily get offended

1133
01:12:55,207 --> 01:12:58,419
the first time somebody treats me
like an idiot, but you are pushing it.

1134
01:12:58,502 --> 01:13:02,089
Now, I know you did not go in there
to tell this guy something he already knew.

1135
01:13:02,173 --> 01:13:03,507
Talk to me.

1136
01:13:04,049 --> 01:13:05,134
Look, Detective.

1137
01:13:05,217 --> 01:13:07,720
Our arrangement doesn't include me
giving you a detailed explanation.

1138
01:13:07,803 --> 01:13:09,597
I say it does, okay?

1139
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:11,348
Okay, you don't own me.

1140
01:13:11,432 --> 01:13:14,602
This cheque-cashing thing, this coke bust,
I can face that on my own.

1141
01:13:14,685 --> 01:13:17,229
I know what I did and what I didn't do.

1142
01:13:17,313 --> 01:13:19,773
- Talk to me.
- Off the record?

1143
01:13:19,857 --> 01:13:23,777
"Off the... " Everything about you
is off the record. Just talk to me.

1144
01:13:24,111 --> 01:13:26,447
- Well, I gave him an incentive.
- Okay.

1145
01:13:26,572 --> 01:13:30,618
- Did he go for it?
- No. But I'd say he's considering it.

1146
01:13:31,952 --> 01:13:33,621
He's smart, isn't he?

1147
01:13:33,871 --> 01:13:35,581
- He thinks he is.
- Yeah.

1148
01:13:36,081 --> 01:13:38,751
One of your types, like the Ivy League type?

1149
01:13:39,293 --> 01:13:41,962
- Clearly well educated.
- That's what I'm talking about.

1150
01:13:42,046 --> 01:13:44,131
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

1151
01:13:44,215 --> 01:13:48,177
You talk like him, so think like him.
What do you think he's gonna do?

1152
01:13:49,845 --> 01:13:52,264
- Well, he's not gonna kill anyone.
- How do you know?

1153
01:13:52,348 --> 01:13:55,100
- Because he's not a murderer.
- How do you know?

1154
01:13:55,184 --> 01:13:57,353
I got news for you.
Most of the guys up in Sing Sing

1155
01:13:57,436 --> 01:13:59,146
weren't murderers
until they killed somebody.

1156
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:03,234
You never know what a person will do
until you push him into a corner.

1157
01:14:03,484 --> 01:14:05,903
But it doesn't seem
like you've pushed him into a corner.

1158
01:14:05,986 --> 01:14:09,365
It doesn't, does it?
Seems more like he chose the corner.

1159
01:14:10,991 --> 01:14:12,284
You're right.

1160
01:14:13,285 --> 01:14:14,829
So, you through?

1161
01:14:15,871 --> 01:14:18,165
- I guess. Are you saying I'm dismissed?
- Yes, I am.

1162
01:14:18,249 --> 01:14:20,876
You got a card, in case I need to call you?

1163
01:14:21,418 --> 01:14:24,338
Please don't take this personally, but no.

1164
01:14:24,505 --> 01:14:26,090
I don't think you can afford me.

1165
01:14:26,173 --> 01:14:30,136
Well, don't take this personally, Miss White.
Kiss my black ass, okay?

1166
01:14:30,302 --> 01:14:34,515
Careful, Detective Frazier.
My bite's much worse than my bark.

1167
01:14:40,521 --> 01:14:42,606
- So, how old are you, Brian?
- Eight and three-quarters.

1168
01:14:42,690 --> 01:14:45,276
Eight and three-quarters. Big boy.

1169
01:14:46,485 --> 01:14:48,612
- Were you scared in there?
- No.

1170
01:14:48,696 --> 01:14:51,365
- No? Not at all, huh?
- Nope. I'm from Brooklyn.

1171
01:14:51,448 --> 01:14:53,033
You're from Brooklyn, huh? I understand.

1172
01:14:53,117 --> 01:14:54,827
- Guns don't scare me.
- They don't scare you?

1173
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:56,328
- Brave, too, huh?
- Yeah.

1174
01:14:56,412 --> 01:14:59,874
So the guys that had the guns,
do you remember them saying anything?

1175
01:14:59,957 --> 01:15:01,834
- Yeah.
- What'd they say?

1176
01:15:01,917 --> 01:15:03,419
They asked me about my game.

1177
01:15:03,502 --> 01:15:06,172
- Who did?
- The guy that robbed the bank. Duh.

1178
01:15:06,839 --> 01:15:08,549
Son, be respectful.

1179
01:15:08,632 --> 01:15:11,385
Okay, Brooklyn.
But it... Was he the one in charge?

1180
01:15:11,469 --> 01:15:12,553
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

1181
01:15:12,845 --> 01:15:15,473
And you don't remember anything else?

1182
01:15:15,639 --> 01:15:17,183
He was kind of tall.

1183
01:15:17,975 --> 01:15:19,185
He had a mask.

1184
01:15:19,268 --> 01:15:23,230
Brian, you think you can recognise him
in any of these pictures?

1185
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:26,484
Take your time. Have a good look.

1186
01:15:27,026 --> 01:15:29,737
Let's keep that over there. Just take a look.

1187
01:15:36,243 --> 01:15:39,455
- With the mask, they look all the same.
- It's true.

1188
01:15:41,207 --> 01:15:44,168
With the mask, they all look the same.
That's right, Brian.

1189
01:15:44,251 --> 01:15:47,588
Attempted robbery. Liquor store.

1190
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:51,425
Well, this was a real step up
for a small-timer like you, huh?

1191
01:15:52,051 --> 01:15:53,886
I got to hand it to you, Pablo.

1192
01:15:53,969 --> 01:15:57,515
First of all, it's Paul. Not Pablo, okay?

1193
01:15:57,723 --> 01:15:58,808
Excuse me.

1194
01:15:59,975 --> 01:16:01,811
- You want some gum?
- No.

1195
01:16:02,603 --> 01:16:04,271
And second, I didn't do it, all right?

1196
01:16:04,355 --> 01:16:06,857
What? I made a few mistakes
when I was a kid.

1197
01:16:06,941 --> 01:16:10,402
I was out with some friends
and they held up a liquor store.

1198
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,155
What was I supposed to do?

1199
01:16:14,949 --> 01:16:17,117
Where'd you grow up, you Wassa Wassa,
Park Avenue?

1200
01:16:17,201 --> 01:16:19,745
- What's that? Wassa what? What'd you say?
- Wassa Wassa.

1201
01:16:21,038 --> 01:16:23,290
You know, a person
that don't come to your neighbourhood.

1202
01:16:23,374 --> 01:16:25,668
How do you say "Rikers Island" in Spanish?

1203
01:16:25,751 --> 01:16:27,336
What about these two?

1204
01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:29,129
That ring a bell?

1205
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:31,590
These two? No.

1206
01:16:31,674 --> 01:16:32,925
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

1207
01:16:33,008 --> 01:16:34,426
Don't they look suspicious to you?

1208
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:38,013
I mean, I would think that you would
want to know who they are.

1209
01:16:38,097 --> 01:16:39,265
No.

1210
01:16:39,348 --> 01:16:41,016
- Well, thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1211
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:43,811
Hey, just out of curiosity
do you know anything about diamonds?

1212
01:16:43,894 --> 01:16:45,980
A bit. What do you need?

1213
01:16:46,063 --> 01:16:48,315
What do you think a guy like me
should pay for a diamond ring?

1214
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:50,359
Depends. How many carats?

1215
01:16:50,442 --> 01:16:52,444
If you'd like, I could give you
my nephew's number.

1216
01:16:52,528 --> 01:16:53,904
- Okay.
- You'll get a very good deal.

1217
01:16:53,988 --> 01:16:55,990
What do you have on underneath?

1218
01:16:56,157 --> 01:16:58,367
- Excuse me?
- Underneath your painter's coat?

1219
01:16:58,450 --> 01:17:00,661
- What do you have on underneath?
- Clothing.

1220
01:17:00,744 --> 01:17:02,830
Could you show us, please?

1221
01:17:07,084 --> 01:17:09,128
You see, there's just you
and one other woman

1222
01:17:09,211 --> 01:17:11,797
that fit the physical description
of the female suspect.

1223
01:17:11,881 --> 01:17:13,090
What's that?

1224
01:17:14,508 --> 01:17:17,803
It's your height, your age, and your...

1225
01:17:18,679 --> 01:17:20,055
Your cup size.

1226
01:17:20,139 --> 01:17:23,601
So, I violated Section 34 double-D?

1227
01:17:23,684 --> 01:17:25,603
That's what you're telling me?

1228
01:17:29,231 --> 01:17:32,485
How dumb do these morons have to be
to think they're gonna get a plane?

1229
01:17:32,568 --> 01:17:33,694
This guy's no moron.

1230
01:17:33,777 --> 01:17:36,530
I don't just mean him. Any hostage taker.

1231
01:17:37,907 --> 01:17:40,534
Those ragheads at the Munich Olympics.

1232
01:17:40,993 --> 01:17:42,620
Who the fuck ever got a plane?

1233
01:17:42,703 --> 01:17:45,372
Shit, and these days?
This guy doesn't know that?

1234
01:17:45,456 --> 01:17:46,624
<i>The area is flooded</i>

1235
01:17:46,707 --> 01:17:49,126
<i>with law enforcement right now.
Snipers are on rooftops...</i>

1236
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:50,503
What you doing there, Keith?

1237
01:17:50,586 --> 01:17:52,338
He wants a plane.
I'm gonna give him a plane.

1238
01:17:52,421 --> 01:17:55,174
- What happened to playing it by the book?
- That's what's bugging me.

1239
01:17:55,257 --> 01:18:00,095
It's like the other team read the book, too,
and they know exactly what we're gonna do.

1240
01:18:02,556 --> 01:18:06,060
This whole time,
we're trying to stall him, right?

1241
01:18:06,143 --> 01:18:07,937
Wrong. They're the ones that are stalling.

1242
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:10,439
Think about it.
The bullshit questions, the Albanian thing...

1243
01:18:10,523 --> 01:18:12,024
So, you're saying he what?

1244
01:18:12,107 --> 01:18:15,736
I'm saying that he wants
to give us more time. He makes demands.

1245
01:18:15,861 --> 01:18:19,114
He gives us deadlines. We stall.
Then he gives us more time.

1246
01:18:19,198 --> 01:18:20,574
I don't think he's in a rush.

1247
01:18:20,658 --> 01:18:22,993
- Why?
- That's what I'm gonna find out.

1248
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:45,683
- Yeah.
- Your plane is ready.

1249
01:18:45,766 --> 01:18:46,934
Is that a fact?

1250
01:18:47,017 --> 01:18:49,478
<i>That's a fact, but I'm gonna need something
from you first.</i>

1251
01:18:49,562 --> 01:18:52,648
I'm gonna need to come in there
and make sure the hostages are okay.

1252
01:18:52,731 --> 01:18:54,441
You'll see them when they get on the bus.

1253
01:18:54,525 --> 01:18:58,070
I just need to make sure
you're not leaving any bodies behind.

1254
01:19:00,406 --> 01:19:02,158
Meet me at the front door.

1255
01:19:08,205 --> 01:19:11,959
- What the hell just happened?
- You got to be crazy to go in there.

1256
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:02,885
Down the stairs.

1257
01:20:11,227 --> 01:20:13,062
- Gum?
- Excuse me?

1258
01:20:13,312 --> 01:20:16,315
- Would you like some gum?
- No, thank you.

1259
01:21:05,698 --> 01:21:07,199
Let me take the kid.

1260
01:21:08,909 --> 01:21:10,035
No.

1261
01:21:10,911 --> 01:21:12,079
Any more?

1262
01:21:12,746 --> 01:21:14,874
There are some who misbehaved.

1263
01:21:20,921 --> 01:21:22,590
Please help me!

1264
01:21:23,466 --> 01:21:24,842
Please help us!

1265
01:21:24,925 --> 01:21:27,386
Please help us! Please!

1266
01:21:28,053 --> 01:21:30,181
We're gonna get you all out of here.

1267
01:21:30,264 --> 01:21:32,016
I promise you.

1268
01:21:32,808 --> 01:21:34,018
Tour is over.

1269
01:21:42,485 --> 01:21:45,905
- Can I ask you a question?
- There is nothing to talk about.

1270
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:48,240
What were you planning on doing

1271
01:21:48,324 --> 01:21:51,243
if you actually got
the plane and the pilots, huh?

1272
01:21:51,494 --> 01:21:54,246
- Excuse me?
- You don't want a plane. You never did.

1273
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:57,625
Who ever heard of bank robbers
escaping on a plane with 50 hostages?

1274
01:21:57,708 --> 01:22:01,253
<i>You saw Dog Day Afternoon. You're stalling.
Why? I don't know.</i>

1275
01:22:02,004 --> 01:22:04,465
What's the matter?
You can't get into the safe?

1276
01:22:04,548 --> 01:22:06,091
Perhaps.

1277
01:22:07,009 --> 01:22:08,469
There's two ways out of this.

1278
01:22:08,552 --> 01:22:12,473
The easy way, we walk out the front door
together, or the hard boys cut the power,

1279
01:22:12,556 --> 01:22:15,392
hit you with the tear gas,
and come in strong through the glass.

1280
01:22:15,476 --> 01:22:18,437
It's your choice. You don't want that.
I don't want that.

1281
01:22:18,521 --> 01:22:20,731
And, you know, they'd like to do it tonight.

1282
01:22:20,815 --> 01:22:22,650
You got night vision?

1283
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:25,820
- You got gas masks?
- Maybe.

1284
01:22:27,029 --> 01:22:29,532
- I'm this close to ordering it.
- Let's cut the crap.

1285
01:22:29,615 --> 01:22:32,618
First, you don't order an assault
when no hostages have been killed

1286
01:22:32,701 --> 01:22:34,203
and there's no immediate threat.

1287
01:22:34,286 --> 01:22:37,373
Second, if it ends that way,
whatever happens,

1288
01:22:37,456 --> 01:22:39,124
you don't get to be the hero.

1289
01:22:39,208 --> 01:22:41,377
You want to bullshit me, try harder.

1290
01:22:42,169 --> 01:22:43,337
Let's go.

1291
01:22:45,256 --> 01:22:46,423
Okay.

1292
01:22:53,931 --> 01:22:56,892
I tell you what. My ass is covered, sport.

1293
01:22:56,976 --> 01:22:59,603
But I would not get too comfortable
in here if I were you.

1294
01:22:59,687 --> 01:23:02,356
No? I got the cable guy
coming on Wednesday.

1295
01:23:02,982 --> 01:23:05,693
- Why don't you just walk out the door?
- I will.

1296
01:23:07,444 --> 01:23:10,656
I'm gonna walk out of that door
when I'm good and ready.

1297
01:23:10,906 --> 01:23:12,908
Can I get you to do that today?

1298
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:15,995
I didn't think so.

1299
01:23:16,078 --> 01:23:17,371
Any other proposals?

1300
01:23:17,454 --> 01:23:19,665
Oh, please. Do not say "proposals. "

1301
01:23:19,748 --> 01:23:22,501
My girlfriend, she wants a proposal from me.

1302
01:23:22,585 --> 01:23:26,255
- You think you're too young to get married?
- No, I'm not too young. Too broke.

1303
01:23:26,338 --> 01:23:28,591
Maybe I should rob a bank.

1304
01:23:29,633 --> 01:23:31,343
You love each other?

1305
01:23:31,886 --> 01:23:33,721
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

1306
01:23:33,846 --> 01:23:36,015
Then money shouldn't really matter.

1307
01:23:36,599 --> 01:23:38,225
Thank you, bank robber.

1308
01:23:38,601 --> 01:23:41,854
I'm just saying money can't buy love.

1309
01:23:43,606 --> 01:23:46,275
Thank you very much. I'm...

1310
01:23:47,693 --> 01:23:49,945
I'm learning so much today, you know?

1311
01:23:50,696 --> 01:23:53,532
Look, why don't we go across
the street to the Killarney Rose, huh?

1312
01:23:53,616 --> 01:23:55,451
Forget about
this dangerous hostage situation.

1313
01:23:55,534 --> 01:23:58,078
- I'll buy you a beer. My treat.
- Thanks, Detective,

1314
01:23:58,162 --> 01:24:01,290
but I'm trying to stay away from bars,
if you know what I mean.

1315
01:24:01,373 --> 01:24:05,419
Well, if you change your mind
there's still a standing offer, all right?

1316
01:24:10,633 --> 01:24:12,802
Cellblock or the graveyard?

1317
01:24:12,885 --> 01:24:14,678
Prison whites or a toe tag?

1318
01:24:14,762 --> 01:24:18,224
- Make up your mind. Tick tock, tick tock.
- Hey! Hey!

1319
01:24:19,141 --> 01:24:20,434
We done?

1320
01:24:23,187 --> 01:24:25,314
You just crossed the fucking line!

1321
01:24:27,107 --> 01:24:29,318
Buses, Kojak, parked outside.

1322
01:24:29,819 --> 01:24:31,487
You think I'm bluffing?

1323
01:24:32,655 --> 01:24:34,990
You roll the dice and see what happens.

1324
01:24:43,999 --> 01:24:46,001
All right. Now get the bunker up.

1325
01:24:46,085 --> 01:24:48,087
- So, what's up?
- Got him right where I want him.

1326
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:49,338
Yeah? Where's that?

1327
01:24:49,421 --> 01:24:52,842
Right behind me with my pants
around my ankles, but it's a start.

1328
01:24:52,925 --> 01:24:54,343
Jesus Christ.

1329
01:25:09,150 --> 01:25:10,484
- What the fuck, man?
- How long?

1330
01:25:10,568 --> 01:25:12,027
- He got the drop on you!
- Two.

1331
01:25:12,111 --> 01:25:13,487
- How long?
- What if he saw your face?

1332
01:25:13,571 --> 01:25:14,905
- Two.
- What if I didn't have my gun?

1333
01:25:14,989 --> 01:25:16,740
Two, maybe three hours.

1334
01:25:16,824 --> 01:25:19,994
You know, you're letting this cop
get too fucking close.

1335
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:24,290
What happened?

1336
01:25:24,373 --> 01:25:26,250
I gave him every excuse
to blow my brains out.

1337
01:25:26,375 --> 01:25:27,501
Yeah.

1338
01:25:27,585 --> 01:25:30,671
He doesn't bite. Why? He ain't the type.

1339
01:25:30,754 --> 01:25:33,215
Let's just step back
and think about this for a second.

1340
01:25:33,299 --> 01:25:36,844
We know that they planned this whole thing.
The tape, the cameras, the costumes.

1341
01:25:36,927 --> 01:25:39,221
There was a game plan,
but it never included aeroplanes.

1342
01:25:39,305 --> 01:25:41,974
He's up to something but it ain't violence.

1343
01:25:45,978 --> 01:25:48,564
<i>I'm listening.
How's the reception?</i>

1344
01:25:48,939 --> 01:25:51,358
<i>- Excuse me?
- The camera on the truck.</i>

1345
01:25:51,775 --> 01:25:54,403
<i>Give me a close-up
on the second-floor window.</i>

1346
01:25:55,112 --> 01:25:57,072
- Rourke?
- I'm on it, I'm on it.

1347
01:26:08,584 --> 01:26:11,086
No, no, no, no, no, no! Fuck!

1348
01:26:11,170 --> 01:26:12,505
Oh, shit.

1349
01:26:16,091 --> 01:26:18,928
Keith! Keith! Keith!

1350
01:26:25,226 --> 01:26:27,603
What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

1351
01:26:27,686 --> 01:26:29,772
You mean beyond the obvious?

1352
01:26:29,939 --> 01:26:32,399
That's what I mean.
Come on, this ain't no bank robbery!

1353
01:26:32,483 --> 01:26:35,361
This is your fault.
I told you to get the buses.

1354
01:26:35,444 --> 01:26:38,864
Fuck you! I didn't kill anybody.

1355
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:43,661
I got 50 more people in here.
You fuck with me again,

1356
01:26:43,744 --> 01:26:45,913
I'll give you two
of the longest days of your life.

1357
01:26:45,996 --> 01:26:50,292
All right, look, just tell me what
it is you really want and I'll get it for you.

1358
01:26:50,376 --> 01:26:53,170
- I promise.
- I've told you. Two buses, a plane.

1359
01:26:53,254 --> 01:26:55,965
Right, right. And box seats
behind home plate at Yankee Stadium.

1360
01:26:56,048 --> 01:26:58,425
Come on, don't bullshit a bullshitter.

1361
01:26:58,968 --> 01:27:01,428
You planned every inch of this thing
right from the start.

1362
01:27:01,512 --> 01:27:06,016
You got everybody marching to your beat,
including me, and I'm through buying it.

1363
01:27:08,477 --> 01:27:10,646
You're too damn smart to be a cop.

1364
01:27:10,729 --> 01:27:12,481
Now get the fuck out of here.

1365
01:27:12,565 --> 01:27:14,483
What? You going to shoot me?

1366
01:27:15,109 --> 01:27:16,652
Do it. Shit, you got nothing to lose.

1367
01:27:16,735 --> 01:27:19,363
I damn sure ain't got nothing to lose,
so shoot me.

1368
01:27:19,446 --> 01:27:20,614
Do it.

1369
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:22,992
- Shoot me.
- Fuck you.

1370
01:27:23,701 --> 01:27:26,203
Tell them to send someone sane over here.

1371
01:27:55,149 --> 01:27:56,650
We got a big problem.

1372
01:27:56,734 --> 01:27:58,986
Hey, Detective, this ain't your day.

1373
01:28:05,576 --> 01:28:07,244
How you doing, Captain?

1374
01:28:09,121 --> 01:28:11,207
Look, I know you
put your trust in me and I just...

1375
01:28:11,290 --> 01:28:14,043
Well, you're a good cop.
Frazier, I need more like you.

1376
01:28:14,126 --> 01:28:16,462
But if you're going down on this one,
I can't go with you.

1377
01:28:16,545 --> 01:28:18,130
You got to understand this, though, sir...

1378
01:28:18,214 --> 01:28:20,382
No, no, no. Let me just tell you
what my problem is, okay?

1379
01:28:20,466 --> 01:28:22,426
I go to bed, everything's hunky-dory.

1380
01:28:22,510 --> 01:28:24,887
I get a call at 3:15, and there's what?
A dead hostage.

1381
01:28:24,970 --> 01:28:28,140
- Right, right, right. But I can end this...
- It is ended.

1382
01:28:28,224 --> 01:28:30,142
See, you think I got options.

1383
01:28:30,226 --> 01:28:32,520
I got to answer to the Chief of D's.

1384
01:28:32,603 --> 01:28:35,439
Darius is calling the shots on this. That's it.

1385
01:28:52,122 --> 01:28:53,916
Hey, Sarge.

1386
01:28:54,208 --> 01:28:56,252
- What'd he say?
- That's it.

1387
01:28:57,586 --> 01:28:58,754
Shit.

1388
01:29:00,256 --> 01:29:02,925
It's a tactical nightmare.
I know.

1389
01:29:03,008 --> 01:29:06,053
Well, first, this is the only way in.

1390
01:29:06,137 --> 01:29:08,389
Then we got to make it up the stairs blind.

1391
01:29:08,472 --> 01:29:10,766
Once we get up there,
we're right out in the open.

1392
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:15,062
<i>They have the advantage of cover.
They can pick us off like sitting ducks.</i>

1393
01:29:15,396 --> 01:29:18,941
<i>Then if we make it across the floor
and down the stairs,</i>

1394
01:29:19,024 --> 01:29:22,361
we still can't tell the homies
from the good guys until they shoot at us.

1395
01:29:22,444 --> 01:29:25,531
Even if it isn't rigged with explosives,
it's still a fucking nightmare.

1396
01:29:31,078 --> 01:29:32,788
Move! Move! Move!

1397
01:29:33,622 --> 01:29:35,291
Open the door!

1398
01:29:49,013 --> 01:29:51,140
Keep moving.
To the right.

1399
01:29:51,223 --> 01:29:52,683
Watch the hands,
watch the hands.

1400
01:29:52,808 --> 01:29:55,269
And let's not forget the possibility
of hostages being killed.

1401
01:29:55,352 --> 01:29:57,146
Right now! Put the gun down!

1402
01:29:57,229 --> 01:30:00,065
Back off or I shoot! I said back off!

1403
01:30:00,149 --> 01:30:03,486
<i>Well, our best hope
is to separate them from the hostages.</i>

1404
01:30:03,569 --> 01:30:06,322
If we can get two or three upstairs
and take them out?

1405
01:30:06,405 --> 01:30:07,573
Kill them?

1406
01:30:15,789 --> 01:30:17,500
Gun! Gun! Gun!

1407
01:30:26,675 --> 01:30:28,177
What if there's more than four?

1408
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:32,973
Yeah, well, that's what's so nuts about it.
Anybody in a painter's suit could be a perp.

1409
01:30:33,098 --> 01:30:36,477
Maybe we should dress our guys up
like a bunch of painters.

1410
01:30:37,228 --> 01:30:41,273
And we should use rubber bullets.
Take head shots. Put their lights out.

1411
01:30:43,025 --> 01:30:44,693
Not a bad idea.
Yeah.

1412
01:30:44,777 --> 01:30:46,779
<i>Rubber bullets it is, baby.</i>

1413
01:30:51,325 --> 01:30:53,077
If this goes down wrong,

1414
01:30:54,078 --> 01:30:57,331
they're going to dump this whole mess
in your lap, you know?

1415
01:30:57,414 --> 01:30:59,208
- I'm making First Grade.
- What?

1416
01:30:59,291 --> 01:31:02,545
I'm making Detective First Grade.
Things ain't all they appear to be.

1417
01:31:02,628 --> 01:31:06,715
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Detective First Grade Keith Frazier.

1418
01:31:06,799 --> 01:31:08,884
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Yes.

1419
01:31:08,968 --> 01:31:11,679
Thank the Mayor
and our mystery guest for that.

1420
01:31:12,388 --> 01:31:14,390
You cut a deal with those guys?

1421
01:31:14,807 --> 01:31:17,059
Never make First Grade? Shit.

1422
01:31:17,935 --> 01:31:19,812
Worked too hard to let that happen.

1423
01:31:19,895 --> 01:31:22,648
Everybody's getting theirs.
I'm gonna get mine.

1424
01:31:24,483 --> 01:31:26,068
I'll be outside.

1425
01:31:31,907 --> 01:31:33,450
What a day, what a day.

1426
01:31:33,534 --> 01:31:37,454
Detective, they're gonna storm that bank
without you? It's not right.

1427
01:31:38,414 --> 01:31:41,792
So, tell me about the kid
who pointed the gun at you, the 12-year-old.

1428
01:31:41,876 --> 01:31:43,502
- Now?
- Yeah.

1429
01:31:44,211 --> 01:31:45,963
Last year, up in the 33rd,

1430
01:31:46,046 --> 01:31:48,883
I was breaking up a fight
about a half a block from the high school.

1431
01:31:48,966 --> 01:31:51,677
This one little spic is getting
his clock cleaned by another one.

1432
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:55,264
Do me a favour, Sergeant.
Just tone down the colour commentary.

1433
01:31:57,099 --> 01:31:59,351
So I bust up the fight,

1434
01:31:59,435 --> 01:32:03,105
I turn around
and this kid is pointing a.22 at my chest.

1435
01:32:03,189 --> 01:32:07,276
- Is that right? Now, which kid was this?
- Another kid, an African-American.

1436
01:32:07,359 --> 01:32:08,903
- An African-American, right?
- Yeah.

1437
01:32:08,986 --> 01:32:10,529
Came out of nowhere. I didn't see him.

1438
01:32:10,613 --> 01:32:11,739
So, what'd you do?

1439
01:32:11,822 --> 01:32:13,949
What did I do then?
I'll tell you what I did then.

1440
01:32:14,033 --> 01:32:17,244
I got shot in the fucking chest.
That's what I did then.

1441
01:32:17,369 --> 01:32:19,663
Yeah, so you'll pardon
my euphemisms, Detective,

1442
01:32:19,747 --> 01:32:23,334
but I would rather wind up an old bigot
than a handsome young corpse.

1443
01:32:23,417 --> 01:32:25,044
Now, no offence, Detective,

1444
01:32:25,127 --> 01:32:27,588
but I'm just trying
to keep them away from us.

1445
01:32:27,671 --> 01:32:30,883
Now, what do you say we just
get these people safely out of the bank?

1446
01:32:30,966 --> 01:32:32,092
I hear that.

1447
01:32:32,176 --> 01:32:35,304
And I'll try and watch
what I say in the future.

1448
01:32:35,387 --> 01:32:37,431
You never know who's listening.

1449
01:32:51,821 --> 01:32:53,364
What are you doing?

1450
01:32:53,447 --> 01:32:54,698
Jesus. Shit.

1451
01:32:55,282 --> 01:32:56,867
They bugged us.

1452
01:32:57,409 --> 01:32:58,702
They bugged us.

1453
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:03,749
Darius!

1454
01:33:04,375 --> 01:33:06,335
Darius, don't make a move!

1455
01:33:06,418 --> 01:33:08,212
<i>- What?
- It's all fucked up!</i>

1456
01:33:08,295 --> 01:33:10,297
Do not make a move! Keep your men back!

1457
01:33:10,381 --> 01:33:11,799
What are you talking about?

1458
01:33:11,882 --> 01:33:13,551
They heard everything we said in the M.C.C.

1459
01:33:13,634 --> 01:33:15,719
<i>- What?
- Stand down! Stand down!</i>

1460
01:33:15,803 --> 01:33:19,140
The drawer with the demands in it!
They heard everything we said!

1461
01:33:19,223 --> 01:33:21,559
They put a transmitter in it!
They bugged us!

1462
01:33:21,642 --> 01:33:23,561
<i>No, no, no. I'm going in.</i>

1463
01:33:25,146 --> 01:33:26,230
Shit.

1464
01:33:34,405 --> 01:33:35,906
Get everyone together.

1465
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:38,409
Steve! Steve-O!

1466
01:33:41,412 --> 01:33:42,872
They're coming in.

1467
01:33:42,997 --> 01:33:44,790
- Everybody good?
- Yeah.

1468
01:33:44,874 --> 01:33:46,917
All right! Everybody out!

1469
01:33:47,001 --> 01:33:49,795
- Put your masks on!
- Everyone out! Out!

1470
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:52,214
- Go now!
- Go!

1471
01:33:52,298 --> 01:33:54,592
Go! Go! Go!

1472
01:33:55,885 --> 01:33:57,595
Now!
Get the fuck out!

1473
01:33:57,928 --> 01:33:59,054
Move!

1474
01:33:59,138 --> 01:34:02,266
Everybody up the fucking stairs!
Move!

1475
01:34:12,276 --> 01:34:13,444
Move!

1476
01:34:41,764 --> 01:34:43,390
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

1477
01:34:43,474 --> 01:34:46,352
- Get down! Get down on the ground!
- Don't shoot!

1478
01:34:50,523 --> 01:34:51,690
Cease fire!

1479
01:34:52,483 --> 01:34:54,193
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1480
01:34:55,653 --> 01:34:57,696
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1481
01:35:00,491 --> 01:35:01,951
Let's go, people.

1482
01:35:18,717 --> 01:35:20,553
Put your hands on your head!
Get down!

1483
01:35:20,636 --> 01:35:21,971
Put your hands on your head.

1484
01:35:22,054 --> 01:35:24,181
- Will somebody stop him?
- Get down!

1485
01:35:24,265 --> 01:35:26,016
Put your hands on your head.

1486
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:28,102
- Put your hands on your head.
- Get them down!

1487
01:35:28,185 --> 01:35:31,063
- On the ground!
- Put your hands on your fucking heads!

1488
01:35:31,147 --> 01:35:32,690
Do not move!

1489
01:35:32,773 --> 01:35:36,861
- Get down, put your hands on your head!
- Put the cuffs on them! Let's go!

1490
01:35:39,738 --> 01:35:41,198
What's going on?

1491
01:35:47,037 --> 01:35:48,706
Don't take any chances!

1492
01:35:51,167 --> 01:35:53,752
It wasn't me! I'm not a criminal!

1493
01:35:54,712 --> 01:35:55,880
Cuffs!

1494
01:35:58,591 --> 01:35:59,717
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1495
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:01,719
- Don't move!
- I'm not moving!

1496
01:36:08,309 --> 01:36:10,478
- Don't move!
- Do not move!

1497
01:36:10,561 --> 01:36:13,439
Check them. Make sure they ain't got
no weapons on them and shit.

1498
01:36:13,522 --> 01:36:15,232
Hernandez!
Right here.

1499
01:36:17,735 --> 01:36:19,820
E.S.U. Team, line up!

1500
01:36:30,873 --> 01:36:32,750
Door to the left, door to the left.

1501
01:36:32,833 --> 01:36:35,127
- Clear on the right.
- Clear!

1502
01:36:37,713 --> 01:36:39,632
- Left side clear.
- Clear!

1503
01:36:41,717 --> 01:36:43,928
- Clear.
- Clear.

1504
01:36:44,011 --> 01:36:46,388
- All clear!
Check under the desk.

1505
01:36:47,097 --> 01:36:49,850
- Clear.
- Checking the office. All clear, Sarge.

1506
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:52,603
- Clear.
- Clear.

1507
01:36:52,686 --> 01:36:53,896
Clear.

1508
01:36:54,855 --> 01:36:55,940
Clear.

1509
01:36:56,023 --> 01:36:57,566
All clear, Sarge.

1510
01:37:01,111 --> 01:37:03,781
All clear. E.S.U. On the stairs.
Line it up!

1511
01:37:11,455 --> 01:37:14,083
Let's go, guys.
Team in, team in. Let's go.

1512
01:37:19,463 --> 01:37:20,589
Clear!

1513
01:37:21,048 --> 01:37:22,258
- Clear.
- Clear.

1514
01:37:24,718 --> 01:37:26,637
- Clear.
- Clear.

1515
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:27,888
Clear.

1516
01:37:28,472 --> 01:37:30,307
- Clear, Sarge.
- Clear.

1517
01:37:31,016 --> 01:37:33,561
Give me a bunker up here.
I need a bunker up front.

1518
01:37:33,644 --> 01:37:35,354
Bringing the bunker up.

1519
01:37:35,437 --> 01:37:36,647
Clear, Sarge.

1520
01:37:38,107 --> 01:37:39,233
Clear.

1521
01:37:39,984 --> 01:37:42,945
- We're almost clear down here.
- Make sure you're sure.

1522
01:37:43,028 --> 01:37:44,697
<i>- I'll keep looking.
- Stay on it.</i>

1523
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:46,157
Roger that.

1524
01:37:46,866 --> 01:37:48,868
Ready? Let's go.

1525
01:37:52,538 --> 01:37:54,165
This is the last door.

1526
01:38:01,505 --> 01:38:03,924
- Clear, Sarge!
- Come on down.

1527
01:38:11,390 --> 01:38:12,975
Did you find a dead hostage?
- Negative.

1528
01:38:13,058 --> 01:38:14,977
If it ain't here,
you must've missed something.

1529
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:17,855
Maybe, but I'm pretty sure we're
the only ones moving around down here.

1530
01:38:17,938 --> 01:38:20,774
Check this out. They forgot to rob the joint.

1531
01:38:20,858 --> 01:38:23,360
Holy shit.
And you didn't find anybody?

1532
01:38:23,444 --> 01:38:25,654
We're still looking,
but there are no bad guys,

1533
01:38:25,738 --> 01:38:27,865
no booby traps, no tunnels, no damage.

1534
01:38:27,948 --> 01:38:29,366
- And nothing missing.
- Great, great, great.

1535
01:38:29,450 --> 01:38:32,369
We'll put out a city-wide description
for David fucking Copperfield, then, huh?

1536
01:38:32,453 --> 01:38:34,455
Listen, I'm not trying to tell you
your jobs, Detectives,

1537
01:38:34,538 --> 01:38:36,540
but unless they swam out
through the toilets,

1538
01:38:36,624 --> 01:38:38,459
whoever did this
is upstairs sucking pavement.

1539
01:38:38,542 --> 01:38:39,835
All right, good job.

1540
01:38:39,919 --> 01:38:41,086
What's that?

1541
01:38:43,798 --> 01:38:44,965
Cell phones.

1542
01:38:46,050 --> 01:38:48,969
- Hey, guys! You need to see this.
- Okay.

1543
01:38:49,303 --> 01:38:53,307
Collins! Grab a uniform, make a quick count
of that money in there, all right?

1544
01:38:53,390 --> 01:38:55,226
- Yes, sir.
- And stand by, all right?

1545
01:38:55,309 --> 01:38:57,228
Don't let anybody get tempted,
including you!

1546
01:38:57,311 --> 01:38:58,395
Yes, sir!

1547
01:38:58,938 --> 01:39:00,564
Right here, Detective.

1548
01:39:00,648 --> 01:39:04,235
- What do you got?
- You're going to love this one. Toy guns.

1549
01:39:04,318 --> 01:39:06,487
Fake guns. You got to be kidding me.

1550
01:39:07,530 --> 01:39:10,241
- Toys.
- As if it wasn't weird enough already.

1551
01:39:10,366 --> 01:39:12,535
<i>Cap,
come to the ladies' room.</i>

1552
01:39:13,077 --> 01:39:14,453
On my way.

1553
01:39:32,429 --> 01:39:33,639
Check it out.

1554
01:39:34,765 --> 01:39:36,809
We can stop looking for that body.

1555
01:39:37,351 --> 01:39:38,602
Fake guns.

1556
01:39:39,603 --> 01:39:41,188
Fake execution.

1557
01:39:42,314 --> 01:39:44,483
Nobody goes home
till we get everybody's story.

1558
01:39:44,567 --> 01:39:47,278
Cap, we got something else
in the storage room.

1559
01:39:59,123 --> 01:40:00,791
- Porcario?
- Yo.

1560
01:40:01,333 --> 01:40:04,503
- Where's the men's room?
- Down the hallway on the left.

1561
01:40:14,805 --> 01:40:17,475
Pick them up, pick them up. Toss them.

1562
01:40:17,558 --> 01:40:19,685
I'm a hostage.
Stop pushing.

1563
01:40:43,167 --> 01:40:47,254
Female hostages to be searched
by female officers only!

1564
01:40:48,214 --> 01:40:50,424
All right, listen,
let's get these people up.

1565
01:40:50,508 --> 01:40:52,676
- I can't hear you. What?
- Valerie Keepsake.

1566
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:54,678
Valerie Keepsake. Go, go, get on the bus.

1567
01:40:54,762 --> 01:40:56,472
- Kenneth Damerjian.
- Yeah.

1568
01:40:56,555 --> 01:40:57,848
Person one.

1569
01:40:57,932 --> 01:41:00,643
- I'm Peter Hammond.
- Eric Dodge.

1570
01:41:00,726 --> 01:41:03,646
- Wait!
- Chaim. My name's Chaim.

1571
01:41:05,397 --> 01:41:07,149
Fucking cocksucker.

1572
01:41:07,817 --> 01:41:09,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1573
01:41:09,443 --> 01:41:11,570
Just give me your name.
Just give me your name.

1574
01:41:11,654 --> 01:41:13,447
Say your name.

1575
01:41:14,323 --> 01:41:16,242
I work in the bank!

1576
01:41:16,492 --> 01:41:19,036
I'm the bank security guard!
Nobody's listening!

1577
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:20,412
Okay, we'll straighten it out.

1578
01:41:20,496 --> 01:41:22,164
Everybody's saying listen!
Nobody's listening!

1579
01:41:22,248 --> 01:41:23,624
We'll straighten it out. Come on.

1580
01:41:23,707 --> 01:41:25,709
- Listen, I'm not getting on the bus!
- Yes, you are.

1581
01:41:25,793 --> 01:41:28,170
Move! Move! Move!
- I am not! I work at the bank!

1582
01:41:28,254 --> 01:41:29,713
Collins, you got this?

1583
01:41:29,797 --> 01:41:31,215
Listen, I work at the bank!

1584
01:41:31,298 --> 01:41:33,425
All right, just get him on the bus.
Get him on the bus.

1585
01:41:33,509 --> 01:41:36,887
- Nobody's listening!
- All right. Calm down. Get on the bus.

1586
01:41:50,401 --> 01:41:52,570
Come on, guys, guys!
Over this way. Over this way.

1587
01:41:52,653 --> 01:41:55,197
Officer, take her over to Sarge. Come on.

1588
01:41:55,447 --> 01:41:58,784
Come on, let's get going
with these people off that line over there.

1589
01:41:58,868 --> 01:42:00,119
Come on.

1590
01:42:06,834 --> 01:42:10,463
Captain, I'm telling you,
this thing is a mess.

1591
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:13,549
They thought this one out, soup to nuts.

1592
01:42:13,632 --> 01:42:15,176
So, lay it out for me.

1593
01:42:15,843 --> 01:42:18,429
We photograph everybody
that came out of the bank.

1594
01:42:18,512 --> 01:42:21,348
We sit them down, we question them,
we show them the photos.

1595
01:42:21,432 --> 01:42:24,977
Most of them can't point to anybody
that's guilty of anything.

1596
01:42:25,644 --> 01:42:29,106
We ask them if they could recognise
anybody who was not one of the bad guys.

1597
01:42:29,190 --> 01:42:31,817
Even if we considered someone
as a possible suspect,

1598
01:42:31,942 --> 01:42:34,653
there's one or two or three other people
that would rule them out.

1599
01:42:34,737 --> 01:42:36,113
It's like the thing never happened.

1600
01:42:36,197 --> 01:42:38,991
- What about prints?
- Everywhere. So what?

1601
01:42:39,867 --> 01:42:43,412
- All it shows is that these people were there.
- Alibis?

1602
01:42:43,496 --> 01:42:44,830
Just about everyone.

1603
01:42:44,914 --> 01:42:46,791
Even if their alibi was weak,

1604
01:42:46,874 --> 01:42:49,960
a hostage would identify them
as being one of the good guys.

1605
01:42:50,044 --> 01:42:51,587
There we are, back to square one.

1606
01:42:51,670 --> 01:42:52,755
Priors?

1607
01:42:52,838 --> 01:42:56,258
We got one employee who had
some juvie stuff. One customer had...

1608
01:42:56,342 --> 01:42:57,468
Excuse me.

1609
01:42:58,177 --> 01:43:00,846
One customer had an out-of-state warrant
for child support.

1610
01:43:00,930 --> 01:43:03,849
Another one had a couple of priors,
G.L.A. mostly.

1611
01:43:04,683 --> 01:43:07,645
Again, same problem.
Plus, he was a fucking idiot.

1612
01:43:07,728 --> 01:43:09,772
- Bank cameras?
- Useless.

1613
01:43:09,855 --> 01:43:12,274
I'm telling you,
they thought of everything. Almost.

1614
01:43:12,358 --> 01:43:14,652
- Sounded like everything to me.
- But this.

1615
01:43:14,735 --> 01:43:17,988
We haven't found that. 357
or the perp that was holding it.

1616
01:43:18,072 --> 01:43:20,783
If you did, there'd be no prints on it anyway.

1617
01:43:21,575 --> 01:43:23,118
- Bury it.
- Bury it?

1618
01:43:23,327 --> 01:43:25,663
What the fuck do you expect me to say?

1619
01:43:29,667 --> 01:43:33,087
Captain, this thing stinks to high hell.
I mean, somebody did something here.

1620
01:43:33,170 --> 01:43:34,713
You said it yourself.

1621
01:43:34,797 --> 01:43:37,383
You got no robbery. No suspects.

1622
01:43:37,925 --> 01:43:40,261
Nobody's breathing down my neck
to come up with answers.

1623
01:43:40,344 --> 01:43:42,930
I'm not gonna breathe down yours. Bury it.

1624
01:43:46,392 --> 01:43:48,227
I wasn't expecting this.

1625
01:43:48,310 --> 01:43:51,355
I promise you,
I'll find you guys more cases to solve.

1626
01:43:53,858 --> 01:43:54,942
Okay.

1627
01:43:56,694 --> 01:43:59,572
Oh, here's something
that you probably did expect.

1628
01:43:59,655 --> 01:44:03,367
- They found that missing Madrugada money.
- No shit.

1629
01:44:03,951 --> 01:44:06,162
Yes, you want to know where it was?

1630
01:44:06,245 --> 01:44:08,414
- In my bank account?
- No.

1631
01:44:08,497 --> 01:44:10,833
- My summer house in Sag Harbour?
- No.

1632
01:44:10,916 --> 01:44:12,585
- My wallet?
- No.

1633
01:44:13,502 --> 01:44:16,213
Then, no. I don't want to know.

1634
01:44:24,054 --> 01:44:25,764
This is bullshit, man.

1635
01:44:25,848 --> 01:44:28,100
I mean, we're the only ones left
trying to catch the bad guys

1636
01:44:28,184 --> 01:44:29,852
and they're gonna come after us like that?

1637
01:44:29,935 --> 01:44:31,937
I'll tell you what.
Every one of your accusers, man,

1638
01:44:32,021 --> 01:44:35,441
I say we go after them all, Keith,
Michael Corleone style.

1639
01:44:35,524 --> 01:44:37,568
"Michael Corleone,
do you renounce Satan?"

1640
01:44:37,651 --> 01:44:39,236
"Yes, I renounce him. "

1641
01:44:40,404 --> 01:44:42,448
There's no 392.

1642
01:44:42,531 --> 01:44:45,493
- Huh?
- Safety deposit box number 392.

1643
01:44:45,576 --> 01:44:47,828
According to these records, it doesn't exist.

1644
01:44:47,912 --> 01:44:50,498
Pinstriped, mayonnaise, lying motherfucker.

1645
01:44:50,664 --> 01:44:53,876
- Didn't Coughlin say we should move on?
- Let's go.

1646
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:05,596
Thank you, again, Your Honour.
I'll come pick it up tomorrow?

1647
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:07,765
- Yes, you're welcome.
- Thank you.

1648
01:45:14,563 --> 01:45:16,065
What are you doing, Detective?

1649
01:45:16,148 --> 01:45:18,692
Now, what business do you have
with Judge Pasqua?

1650
01:45:18,776 --> 01:45:20,277
Police business.

1651
01:45:20,361 --> 01:45:23,739
- Weren't you told to bury this?
- I got a job to do, Miss White.

1652
01:45:23,823 --> 01:45:26,617
And since when is your job
more important than your career?

1653
01:45:26,700 --> 01:45:29,119
- Or did you forget our arrangement?
- We didn't have any arrangement.

1654
01:45:29,203 --> 01:45:30,621
Let me tell you how this works. You...

1655
01:45:30,704 --> 01:45:32,748
No, let me tell you how this works.

1656
01:45:32,832 --> 01:45:36,043
You press here to record
and you press here to play.

1657
01:45:36,127 --> 01:45:38,462
<i>There's
also the matter of the $140,000</i>

1658
01:45:38,546 --> 01:45:39,713
<i>that seems to have walked away</i>

1659
01:45:39,797 --> 01:45:42,550
<i>from the Madrugada cheque-cashing bust.</i>

1660
01:45:42,716 --> 01:45:44,969
<i>I didn't have anything
to do with that, so...</i>

1661
01:45:45,052 --> 01:45:47,138
<i>We'd like to be
in your corner on that.</i>

1662
01:45:47,221 --> 01:45:50,057
<i>In exchange for what? I mean, what,
do you want me to do something unethical?</i>

1663
01:45:50,141 --> 01:45:52,101
<i>I mean, no disrespect to the both of youse</i>

1664
01:45:52,184 --> 01:45:54,228
<i>but I don't need you
to be in my corner, Mr Mayor.</i>

1665
01:45:54,311 --> 01:45:55,646
<i>Look, I'm innocent.</i>

1666
01:45:55,729 --> 01:45:58,482
<i>Innocent or guilty,
you're still going down.</i>

1667
01:45:59,316 --> 01:46:03,320
<i>Give Miss White whatever
she needs, or your career is over.</i>

1668
01:46:03,779 --> 01:46:04,905
<i>Done.</i>

1669
01:46:05,281 --> 01:46:06,490
<i>Kaput.</i>

1670
01:46:07,992 --> 01:46:10,953
So? You gave me what I wanted.

1671
01:46:11,036 --> 01:46:14,165
Your career is blossoming
and all is right with the world.

1672
01:46:14,248 --> 01:46:15,749
What was Case hiding?

1673
01:46:18,919 --> 01:46:22,381
You know, there's a famous saying
by the Baron de Rothschild.

1674
01:46:24,133 --> 01:46:27,344
"When there's blood on the streets,
buy property. "

1675
01:46:29,805 --> 01:46:32,850
I think Mr Case
really took that sentiment to heart.

1676
01:46:32,933 --> 01:46:35,811
But he is no different
than half the Fortune 500.

1677
01:46:37,188 --> 01:46:38,939
Let it go, Detective.

1678
01:46:40,399 --> 01:46:42,026
You're a good cop.

1679
01:46:42,776 --> 01:46:44,528
This city needs you.

1680
01:47:12,681 --> 01:47:16,185
- Lady! Lady, you're in the wrong place.
- I have an appointment.

1681
01:47:24,777 --> 01:47:25,986
Arthur.

1682
01:47:26,779 --> 01:47:29,365
- Good morning.
- Miss White.

1683
01:47:30,157 --> 01:47:31,492
Have a seat.

1684
01:47:33,369 --> 01:47:36,205
Thank you, Vincent. That's all for now.
Thank you.

1685
01:47:39,792 --> 01:47:42,002
Well. What did he say?

1686
01:47:42,086 --> 01:47:45,089
Well, Detective Frazier
turned out to be quite sharp.

1687
01:47:45,172 --> 01:47:48,342
But I just fast-tracked his career a little
and he's under control.

1688
01:47:48,425 --> 01:47:51,387
I hope so. Tell me about the envelope.

1689
01:47:51,804 --> 01:47:52,972
Where is it now?

1690
01:47:53,055 --> 01:47:55,933
Well, the gang leader
is going to hang on to it,

1691
01:47:56,016 --> 01:47:59,145
as an insurance policy
to keep you from seeking revenge.

1692
01:47:59,812 --> 01:48:02,565
Clearly, he has a very low opinion of you.

1693
01:48:02,648 --> 01:48:03,983
And what might that be?

1694
01:48:04,066 --> 01:48:07,361
Well, let's see.
In a nutshell, that you got rich,

1695
01:48:07,570 --> 01:48:10,656
doing business with the Nazis
during the Holocaust.

1696
01:48:13,909 --> 01:48:15,035
Yes.

1697
01:48:16,245 --> 01:48:19,331
It was 60 years ago.
I was young and ambitious.

1698
01:48:19,957 --> 01:48:22,751
I saw a short path to success and I took it.

1699
01:48:24,378 --> 01:48:25,921
I sold my soul.

1700
01:48:27,673 --> 01:48:30,676
And I've been trying to buy it back
ever since.

1701
01:48:30,759 --> 01:48:35,264
But you and this mystery man,
you have an understanding?

1702
01:48:35,431 --> 01:48:39,268
I think so. And he managed
to get out of there with that envelope.

1703
01:48:40,269 --> 01:48:43,606
If someday
he comes back to blackmail you, well,

1704
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:47,151
you'll pay him. And you'll get it back.

1705
01:48:48,444 --> 01:48:50,488
- So, I guess that's it.
- I suppose so.

1706
01:48:50,571 --> 01:48:52,448
- Bullshit.
- I beg your pardon?

1707
01:48:52,531 --> 01:48:56,410
He didn't go through all that just to stick
your envelope under his mattress.

1708
01:48:56,494 --> 01:48:59,288
Look, they left money untouched, Arthur.

1709
01:48:59,371 --> 01:49:00,456
So?

1710
01:49:00,581 --> 01:49:04,960
So, he had to have walked out of there
with something else.

1711
01:49:05,961 --> 01:49:08,464
The bank says
that there was nothing missing.

1712
01:49:08,547 --> 01:49:11,133
So, there had to have been
something in that box

1713
01:49:11,217 --> 01:49:13,928
that was worth more to him
than your envelope.

1714
01:49:15,805 --> 01:49:17,807
You don't have to tell me.

1715
01:49:17,890 --> 01:49:20,476
There's only one thing it could be anyway.

1716
01:49:23,646 --> 01:49:24,814
Diamonds.

1717
01:49:25,773 --> 01:49:27,650
And then there's the ring.

1718
01:49:28,317 --> 01:49:29,735
Cartier ring.

1719
01:49:30,361 --> 01:49:33,322
It belonged to the wife of a Parisian banker.

1720
01:49:33,739 --> 01:49:36,408
Wealthy family of French Jews.

1721
01:49:37,076 --> 01:49:40,204
And when the war came along,
the ring and everything else they owned

1722
01:49:40,287 --> 01:49:45,126
was confiscated and they were shipped off
to concentration camps. None survived.

1723
01:49:47,128 --> 01:49:48,754
We were friends.

1724
01:49:49,672 --> 01:49:51,465
I could have helped them.

1725
01:49:53,384 --> 01:49:58,222
But the Nazis paid too well.

1726
01:50:00,141 --> 01:50:04,728
Can I trust that you will keep
what you've learnt

1727
01:50:04,812 --> 01:50:08,107
here today confidential?

1728
01:50:09,191 --> 01:50:11,485
Despite whatever you may think?

1729
01:50:20,578 --> 01:50:21,996
Yes, Arthur.

1730
01:50:23,956 --> 01:50:27,126
Well, I'd love to tell you
what a monster you are,

1731
01:50:27,334 --> 01:50:31,505
but I have to help bin Laden's nephew
buy a co-op on Park Avenue.

1732
01:50:35,718 --> 01:50:38,179
If that were true, you wouldn't tell me.

1733
01:50:38,471 --> 01:50:40,639
We're listing you as a reference.

1734
01:50:55,112 --> 01:50:57,448
My name is Dalton Russell.

1735
01:50:58,032 --> 01:50:59,867
Pay strict attention to what I say

1736
01:50:59,950 --> 01:51:03,579
because I choose my words carefully
and I never repeat myself.

1737
01:51:03,662 --> 01:51:06,373
<i>I've told you my name. That's the "who. "</i>

1738
01:51:07,416 --> 01:51:11,086
<i>The "where" could most readily
be described as a prison cell.</i>

1739
01:51:11,629 --> 01:51:13,214
But there is a vast difference

1740
01:51:13,297 --> 01:51:16,801
between being stuck in a tiny cell
and being in prison.

1741
01:51:18,511 --> 01:51:20,137
<i>The "what" is easy.</i>

1742
01:51:21,138 --> 01:51:25,851
<i>Recently I planned and set in motion
events to execute the perfect bank robbery.</i>

1743
01:51:26,894 --> 01:51:28,813
That's also the "when. "

1744
01:51:29,814 --> 01:51:34,193
<i>As for the "why,"
beyond the obvious financial motivation,</i>

1745
01:51:34,944 --> 01:51:36,695
<i>it's exceedingly simple.</i>

1746
01:51:37,112 --> 01:51:38,531
<i>Because I can.</i>

1747
01:51:39,657 --> 01:51:41,909
<i>Which leaves us only with the "how. "</i>

1748
01:51:42,701 --> 01:51:45,746
<i>And therein, as the Bard would tell us,</i>

1749
01:51:46,831 --> 01:51:48,290
<i>lies the rub.</i>

1750
01:52:37,506 --> 01:52:41,093
He's gonna smell like shit.
What do you expect after a week?

1751
01:52:43,471 --> 01:52:44,555
Yeah.

1752
01:52:45,014 --> 01:52:47,475
Why do you think I rolled down the window?

1753
01:53:07,161 --> 01:53:08,412
Oh, shit.

1754
01:53:13,876 --> 01:53:16,420
That cop, Frazier, and his partner
are walking into the bank.

1755
01:53:16,504 --> 01:53:19,799
<i>- Are they coming for me?
- Can't say. It's just the two of them.</i>

1756
01:53:27,431 --> 01:53:30,434
Yeah, everything's going great today.
No.

1757
01:53:30,768 --> 01:53:33,771
Yeah, about 5:30. Okay.

1758
01:53:34,230 --> 01:53:36,774
Sounds like fun. Okay.

1759
01:53:37,566 --> 01:53:39,109
Talk to you later.

1760
01:54:00,506 --> 01:54:02,258
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

1761
01:54:05,553 --> 01:54:06,971
Mr Hammond?

1762
01:54:07,054 --> 01:54:08,806
Good morning, Detectives.

1763
01:54:12,351 --> 01:54:13,936
Just like he planned.

1764
01:54:14,019 --> 01:54:16,605
I got a court order here
to open a safe deposit box.

1765
01:54:16,689 --> 01:54:18,607
Number 392.

1766
01:54:29,827 --> 01:54:31,579
Oh, thank God.

1767
01:54:37,334 --> 01:54:38,711
Where is it?

1768
01:54:39,503 --> 01:54:40,963
I left it in there.

1769
01:54:41,046 --> 01:54:42,715
This way, Detectives.

1770
01:54:42,798 --> 01:54:45,384
Why did you do that? You left the ring.

1771
01:54:45,468 --> 01:54:46,719
Trust me.

1772
01:54:47,678 --> 01:54:49,346
I left it in good hands.

1773
01:54:50,222 --> 01:54:51,849
<i>I'm no martyr.</i>

1774
01:54:52,558 --> 01:54:54,268
<i>I did it for the money.</i>

1775
01:54:55,978 --> 01:54:59,648
<i>But it's not worth much
if you can't face yourself in the mirror.</i>

1776
01:55:00,441 --> 01:55:03,068
<i>Respect is the ultimate currency.</i>

1777
01:55:05,905 --> 01:55:09,867
<i>I was stealing from a man
who traded his away for a few dollars.</i>

1778
01:55:11,744 --> 01:55:14,246
<i>And then he tried to wash away his guilt.</i>

1779
01:55:15,372 --> 01:55:19,418
<i>Drown it in a lifetime of good deeds
and a sea of respectability.</i>

1780
01:55:20,211 --> 01:55:22,338
- Let me get that.
- Let me.

1781
01:55:22,421 --> 01:55:23,798
<i>It almost worked, too.</i>

1782
01:55:23,881 --> 01:55:25,007
Okay.

1783
01:55:27,092 --> 01:55:28,469
<i>But inevitably,</i>

1784
01:55:29,428 --> 01:55:31,597
<i>the further you run from your sins,</i>

1785
01:55:32,431 --> 01:55:35,518
<i>the more exhausted you are
when they catch up to you.</i>

1786
01:55:35,726 --> 01:55:36,894
<i>And they do.</i>

1787
01:55:38,771 --> 01:55:40,314
Son of a bitch.

1788
01:55:40,397 --> 01:55:41,607
<i>Certain.</i>

1789
01:55:42,608 --> 01:55:44,276
<i>It will not fail.</i>

1790
01:55:48,656 --> 01:55:50,658
What do you think that's worth?

1791
01:55:50,950 --> 01:55:53,619
If you got to ask, man,
you can't afford it.

1792
01:55:53,702 --> 01:55:56,080
Thank goodness my girlfriend ain't here.

1793
01:55:58,207 --> 01:55:59,959
"Follow the ring"?

1794
01:56:14,014 --> 01:56:16,976
- Detective Frazier.
- Mr Case.

1795
01:56:17,143 --> 01:56:19,145
- How are you?
- I am great.

1796
01:56:19,562 --> 01:56:22,982
Nobody got killed at the bank.
Everybody's happy. My kind of day.

1797
01:56:23,065 --> 01:56:25,025
That's wonderful. Wonderful.

1798
01:56:25,109 --> 01:56:26,819
- Detective Mitchell.
- Mr Case.

1799
01:56:26,902 --> 01:56:28,863
- Be seated, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

1800
01:56:28,946 --> 01:56:31,240
- Can I offer you anything?
- No.

1801
01:56:31,323 --> 01:56:32,908
I must say

1802
01:56:33,284 --> 01:56:35,703
I was most impressed

1803
01:56:36,871 --> 01:56:38,789
by the way you handled that business.

1804
01:56:38,873 --> 01:56:40,166
Thank you, Mr Case.

1805
01:56:40,249 --> 01:56:42,168
Whenever I hear the term
"New York's Finest"

1806
01:56:42,251 --> 01:56:44,003
you're who I think of.

1807
01:56:44,086 --> 01:56:47,339
You keep the rest of us safe
and make it look easy.

1808
01:56:49,633 --> 01:56:52,011
- Pardon me.
- Well, what's so amusing?

1809
01:56:52,094 --> 01:56:55,014
When you say "the rest of us," Mr Case,
I mean, you got to look around.

1810
01:56:55,097 --> 01:56:59,185
"The rest of us" is a category
that you haven't qualified for in a long time.

1811
01:56:59,268 --> 01:57:01,979
Touchי, Detective.
I won't deny it. I've done well.

1812
01:57:02,062 --> 01:57:04,190
Yes, you have. But I'm very confused.

1813
01:57:04,273 --> 01:57:06,025
You see, I got a case

1814
01:57:06,775 --> 01:57:09,737
where armed robbers
laid siege to your bank.

1815
01:57:09,820 --> 01:57:11,155
It is your bank, right?

1816
01:57:11,238 --> 01:57:13,115
Well, I'm Chairman of the Board of Directors.

1817
01:57:13,199 --> 01:57:14,867
Then ita-zita-vene-gazoo.

1818
01:57:14,950 --> 01:57:16,869
The robbers disappear. Poof.

1819
01:57:17,203 --> 01:57:18,621
And they don't take a nickel, right?

1820
01:57:18,704 --> 01:57:21,040
- You're asking me?
- Yes, I'm asking you.

1821
01:57:21,123 --> 01:57:23,292
I mean, it's your bank. You own it.
I'm asking you.

1822
01:57:23,375 --> 01:57:25,252
It's a tiny part of our organisation.

1823
01:57:25,336 --> 01:57:27,463
No robbers. No real victims.
No loot missing.

1824
01:57:27,546 --> 01:57:29,632
It's got to be the first time
in law-enforcement history.

1825
01:57:29,715 --> 01:57:30,883
I never heard of it before.

1826
01:57:30,966 --> 01:57:34,011
So, you got to ask yourself, "What the fuck
happened?" Don't you, Mr Case?

1827
01:57:34,094 --> 01:57:35,721
I'm not quite sure I like your tone, Officer.

1828
01:57:35,805 --> 01:57:38,140
You don't like my tone?
Then give me a straight answer.

1829
01:57:38,224 --> 01:57:42,061
It's the founding bank of your empire.
You built it. It's your baby.

1830
01:57:42,144 --> 01:57:44,188
Give me a straight answer.
What do you think happened?

1831
01:57:44,271 --> 01:57:47,900
- I have no idea.
- Oh, come on, now. Come on.

1832
01:57:47,983 --> 01:57:49,401
I'll tell you what I think happened.

1833
01:57:49,485 --> 01:57:51,612
I think you sent that woman in there
to patch things up.

1834
01:57:51,695 --> 01:57:54,240
Miss White. I think you paid her.
What was she doing in there?

1835
01:57:54,323 --> 01:57:55,783
Look, this is absurd.

1836
01:57:55,866 --> 01:57:57,827
Are you implying that
I had anything to do with it?

1837
01:57:57,910 --> 01:57:59,537
392.

1838
01:58:00,079 --> 01:58:02,581
Safe deposit box 392.
What's the story on that?

1839
01:58:02,665 --> 01:58:05,042
- I have no idea what you're...
- Don't lie to me, Mr Case.

1840
01:58:05,126 --> 01:58:07,628
- I don't lie.
- I looked at all the records.

1841
01:58:07,711 --> 01:58:11,257
All the bank records
for safe deposit boxes at your bank.

1842
01:58:11,423 --> 01:58:14,135
At first glance, everything looked fine,

1843
01:58:14,885 --> 01:58:17,221
but there was one safe deposit box
that had no records.

1844
01:58:17,304 --> 01:58:19,265
I mean, going all the way back to 1948.

1845
01:58:19,348 --> 01:58:22,476
So I started thinking.
Who would have the answer to this riddle?

1846
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:24,436
Probably the man who forgot to mention

1847
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:26,814
that he built the bank
in the first place in 1948.

1848
01:58:26,897 --> 01:58:29,733
It doesn't add up, Mr Case.
It does not add up.

1849
01:58:30,651 --> 01:58:34,989
I'm afraid I can't be
of any further use to you, Detective.

1850
01:58:36,157 --> 01:58:38,659
It's something really bad, isn't it?

1851
01:58:39,368 --> 01:58:43,998
Mr Frazier, I have spent
my whole life serving humanity.

1852
01:58:45,458 --> 01:58:47,501
You can ask anyone who knows me.

1853
01:58:48,794 --> 01:58:51,797
They'll vouch for me,
and for the things that I've done.

1854
01:58:51,881 --> 01:58:54,925
You think they'll vouch for you
after I find out the truth about this ring?

1855
01:58:55,009 --> 01:58:56,385
I don't think so.

1856
01:59:01,056 --> 01:59:04,101
Oh, by the way, that thing you said
about us being New York's finest?

1857
01:59:04,185 --> 01:59:06,896
I want you to know,
we really appreciate that.

1858
01:59:07,438 --> 01:59:08,772
How gracious.

1859
01:59:09,607 --> 01:59:12,276
Let's go. We're gonna follow that ring.

1860
01:59:19,283 --> 01:59:21,869
- Hey, Keith, let me see your shoe.
- What?

1861
01:59:21,952 --> 01:59:24,330
- Let me see your shoe.
- Why?

1862
01:59:24,413 --> 01:59:28,459
'Cause I have never seen anybody
put their foot that far up a guy's ass.

1863
01:59:30,544 --> 01:59:32,213
Yeah, I guess I did, didn't I?

1864
01:59:32,296 --> 01:59:34,882
Oh, man. You cut him an ass
the length of the Lincoln Tunnel.

1865
01:59:34,965 --> 01:59:37,635
We're gonna need a traffic cop on that shit.

1866
01:59:46,227 --> 01:59:47,394
Good afternoon, sir.

1867
01:59:47,478 --> 01:59:49,396
- Do you have a reservation?
- Looking for the Mayor.

1868
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:51,440
- May I have your hat, please?
- No, you cannot. Get your own.

1869
01:59:51,524 --> 01:59:54,109
They're looking to invest
$4 billion over the next four years.

1870
01:59:54,193 --> 01:59:55,319
And that's all in place.

1871
01:59:55,402 --> 01:59:58,405
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Mayor,
but there's an old American saying,

1872
01:59:58,489 --> 02:00:02,243
"When there's blood on the streets,
somebody's got to go to jail. "

1873
02:00:02,910 --> 02:00:05,913
Edwin, could you please excuse us
for a minute?

1874
02:00:07,998 --> 02:00:09,583
What's this about, Detective?

1875
02:00:09,667 --> 02:00:13,212
I believe Detective Frazier
is looking for some closure?

1876
02:00:13,546 --> 02:00:15,798
That's a good word. Closure.

1877
02:00:15,881 --> 02:00:18,467
Case closed, you know what I mean?

1878
02:00:18,551 --> 02:00:19,885
This is the number

1879
02:00:19,969 --> 02:00:24,014
of the War Crimes Issues office
in Washington, D.C.

1880
02:00:25,641 --> 02:00:28,269
<i>How'd you like to be on the front page
of the New York Times?</i>

1881
02:00:28,352 --> 02:00:29,436
That'd be great.

1882
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:33,482
Make sure they spell my name right, though.
That's Frazier with a "z".

1883
02:00:33,983 --> 02:00:35,526
You can keep the pen.

1884
02:00:36,235 --> 02:00:37,736
You made copies?

1885
02:00:39,321 --> 02:00:40,531
Please.

1886
02:00:40,948 --> 02:00:44,368
We got to keep the real criminals
off the streets, Your Honour.

1887
02:00:45,828 --> 02:00:48,497
All right, well, thanks for lunch.

1888
02:00:52,877 --> 02:00:54,462
War crimes, huh?

1889
02:00:55,254 --> 02:00:57,465
What have you got me into this time?

1890
02:01:17,067 --> 02:01:18,152
Mama?

1891
02:01:22,865 --> 02:01:25,618
- Did you bring Big Willie?
- And the twins.

1892
02:01:39,256 --> 02:01:40,508
Slow down, girl.

1893
02:01:40,591 --> 02:01:42,968
I'll get my gun off
before I get my gun off, okay?

1894
02:01:43,052 --> 02:01:44,303
Pow, pow.

1895
02:02:26,262 --> 02:02:27,972
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

1896
02:02:28,722 --> 02:02:30,349
<i>Why don't you
just walk out the door?</i>

1897
02:02:30,432 --> 02:02:31,517
<i>I will.</i>

1898
02:02:31,767 --> 02:02:34,645
<i>I'm gonna walk out of that door
when I'm good and ready.</i>

1899
02:02:34,728 --> 02:02:36,021
Son of a bitch.

1900
02:02:43,404 --> 02:02:46,282
Come on, honey.
The handcuffs are getting cold.

1901
02:02:47,305 --> 02:03:47,537
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
