Have you ever caught
sight of yourself by accident

3
00:00:57,542 --> 00:01:01,417
and you see yourself
from the outside?

4
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,041
That's who you really are.

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,875
Excuse me.
I'm supposed to pick up a dress.

6
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:21,166
- Nothing owed.
Your lady must have paid.

7
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,375
- Thank you.

8
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,208
No, Geri.

9
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,583
Girl, I'm not talking crazy,

10
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:49,083
and I don't need you
to come over.

11
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:53,875
I just...need you to stay
on the phone, okay?

12
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57,709
I can't sleep,
and I want to talk.

13
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,417
- Ma'am.

14
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:14,500
- My lady's going out
for the evening.

15
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,959
- May I have
my room key, please?

16
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:21,291
The stars
continue to arrive

17
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,041
at the 1955 Academy Awards
here in New York

18
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,417
and out in Los Angeles.

19
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:29,083
- This is it, Dottie.

20
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,667
- This is it.

21
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:38,417
Tonight in New York City.

22
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,792
Ladies and gentlemen,
the first-ever colored nominee

23
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,041
for Best Actress,
Dorothy Dandridge,

24
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,083
star of "Carmen Jones."

25
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,917
She's arriving tonight with
her sister Vivian Dandridge.

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,917
Dorothy, can we talk
to you for a moment?

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,458
Dorothy, the world
is watching.

28
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:54,333
How does it feel?

29
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:56,542
It feels like Christmas!

30
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,959
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

31
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:01,667
- There she goes,
Dorothy Dandridge,

32
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,166
nominated for Best Actress
in "Carmen Jones."

33
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,834
The other nominees are
Judy Garland,

34
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:09,959
Audrey Hepburn,
Grace Kelly...

35
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,375
We love you, sugar.

36
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,750
- We love you, Dorothy!

37
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,250
- Hi. Thank you.

38
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,125
- Dorothy!

39
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,291
Dorothy!

40
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,083
- Come on, Dottie.

41
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,208
Come on!

42
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,500
Dottie!

43
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,083
Would you please
come on?

44
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,500
- I can't do another!

45
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,041
- Dottie, how many times
you gonna get the chance

46
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,542
to take another call
at the Cotton?

47
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:43,375
- We've done ten already,
and my feet are swollen!

48
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,000
- Oh, would you make her?
- One more time,

49
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,750
The Dandridge Sisters!
- Come on!

1940's freshest faces,

57
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:26,792
the lovely Dandridge Sisters!

58
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,875
- Hey! Heh!

59
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:33,125
First rule of dancing offstage
is landing on your feet.

60
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,834
- You weren't there
a second ago.

61
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:36,917
- But I'm here now,
and here I plan to stay.

62
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,208
- Well, aren't you
easy on the eyes?

63
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,250
I'm Harold.
- And I'm Fayard.

64
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,583
We're the Nicholas Brothers.

65
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:45,166
- Everybody knows
the Nicholas Brothers.

66
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,542
- You're famous.

67
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,166
- Hey, Fayard, did you hear
that? We're famous.

68
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,834
- Who's famous?
- We're famous.

69
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:51,250
- We're famous?
- That's what she said.

70
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,083
- Yeah?
Well, nobody told me.

71
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,208
- We held the record

72
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,959
for the most calls
at the Cotton Club.

73
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,458
Well, till tonight.

74
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:59,250
You sisters got us
beat by two.

75
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,792
- Oh, no,
we're not sisters.

76
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,250
Well, we are.
- But not me.

77
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,625
- It's just
our stage name.

78
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:07,166
- Ladies.
Got to go, Harold.

79
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,000
- Yeah.
Cool your taps, Fayard.

80
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,959
I say my brother and I hit
the lucky 13 tonight.

81
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,125
- What's so lucky
about 13?

82
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,291
- We hit it, you go with me

83
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,583
to the picture show
Friday night.

84
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:16,750
- What makes you think

85
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:18,083
I want to go
anywhere with you?

86
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,333
- I don't think.
I know.

87
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:22,125
There's no place like home.

88
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,083
Ladies and gentlemen...

89
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,250
- So what do you say?

90
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,625
- You hit 13,
you pick me up Friday night.

91
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:29,166
- Friday night.
- The one, the only,

92
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,208
the Nicholas Brothers!
- Let's go.

93
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,792
- Oh!

94
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,583
- Oh!
- Aah!

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,458
- What did I tell you about
getting your skirt snipped?

96
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:23,875
- He's just being nice.

97
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:26,125
- Ain't no such thing
as nice to a fox in a henhouse,

98
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,583
even if it is a famous fox.
You're here to work!

99
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,333
Change your clothes,
get your coats on.

100
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:31,750
I want you in bed by 1:00.

101
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:34,625
Mean old snake.

102
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:36,542
Made us call her "Auntie."

103
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,000
Remember that? Hmh!

104
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,709
She wasn't nothing
but Mama's special friend.

105
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,125
Hmm.

106
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,375
But that night,

107
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,959
I barely even knew
she was there.

108
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,083
Ladies and gentlemen,

109
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,166
the Nicholas Brothers!

110
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,166
Hey!

111
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,417
We hit it.
Lucky 13.

112
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,083
- Congratulations.

113
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,667
- So where do I pick you up
Friday night?

114
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,834
- Los Angeles.

115
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:14,166
- L.A.?

116
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,000
- That's where I'm gonna be
come Friday night.

117
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,500
Move it!

118
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,166
- You know, a bad boy like you

119
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,750
don't want to mess
with that girl, Harry.

120
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:25,333
She's a good girl,
sweet as pie.

121
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:32,417
- Hmm.
That ain't bad, either.

122
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,208
- Thank you.
- Ma'am.

123
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,458
- Is Mama home?

124
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:49,250
- No, she's where
she always is, working.

125
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,750
Excuse me.

126
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,375
If I remember correctly,

127
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,625
I was promised a date
for Friday,

128
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,625
and this is Friday.

129
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:02,208
That's...if it's all right
with you, ma'am.

130
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,959
And might I say you are
looking lovely today?

131
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,792
The sunshine agrees with you.

132
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,166
- Is that your car?

133
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,625
- It's a beauty,
isn't it?

134
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:13,500
Cost a pretty penny,

135
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,875
but it's only money.

136
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,208
- Now, that is a man.

137
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,333
Hmm?

138
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:25,458
- Mm-hmm.

139
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:29,709
Ooh!

140
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:31,959
Hey, honey, you gonna
sleep in this room

141
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,583
with all them microbugs
crawling all over you?

142
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:37,333
I don't think they'll
bother me, Hyacinth.

143
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:41,000
Oh. Oh. Now...oh!

144
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,834
You know, Dottie,

145
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:47,291
I got a thing for you
that just won't leave me alone.

146
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,375
- Shh.
Watch the movie.

147
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,125
You know what I've done?

148
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,250
I sprinkle him
with Egyptian Nights,

149
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,667
and when he come to,
we was living on 110th,

150
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,417
overlooking the park.

151
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,834
Of course,
I had to pay the rent.

152
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,667
Hey.

153
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,917
Come on, let's go.
I mean...

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,458
I got better things
I can think of doing

155
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:12,083
than sitting watching
some old plantation mammy.

156
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,083
- That plantation mammy
is my mother.

157
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,542
Yeah...

158
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,375
- You really ought to try some.
It never fails.

159
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:23,959
- Dottie. Dottie.

160
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,208
Dottie, I didn't know.

161
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,625
Dottie, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

162
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:28,208
- She didn't have
a choice, you know.

163
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,875
After my daddy left,
she had to feed us,

164
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:33,542
and playin' a maid is a world
easier than bein' a maid.

165
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,208
- Of course it is.
Listen.

166
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,500
I didn't mean
any disrespect.

167
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,083
Please don't be sore.

168
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,291
- I'm not sore.
- Yes, you are.

169
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,208
It's your mother,
and what I said was stupid.

170
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,625
Believe me,
I know about being poor.

171
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:49,875
- We were so poor,

172
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:51,792
my mama put us on
the Chitlin' Circuit.

173
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,417
- We were on the
Chitlin' Circuit, too,

174
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,125
only we were so poor,

175
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,875
we couldn't afford
the chitlins.

176
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,583
- Well, we were so poor,
we had to sleep

177
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,291
four to a bed
everywhere we went.

178
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,166
- Dottie, we were so poor

179
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,750
that my mother had to sew
all of our costumes,

180
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:09,250
and she couldn't sew.

181
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,125
One pants leg was always
coming out shorter

182
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,583
than the other one.

183
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,750
Fayard and I used to have to tap
with one knee bent.

184
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:17,041
See, that's where
that step comes from.

185
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,333
When you see us doing this...

186
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,792
- That's where
it comes from.

187
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,208
- You're so crazy.

188
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,959
- I'm only crazy

189
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,166
when it comes to you.

190
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:50,041
- You know what time it is?

191
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,959
- We went for ice cream
after the movie.

192
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,333
- What else you go for?

193
00:10:58,417 --> 00:11:00,375
- Where's Mama?

194
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,625
- Night shift.

195
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,375
What you let him
do to you?

196
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,083
You let him
stick it in you?

197
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,625
- I need to get...
- I'm talking to you.

198
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,000
- It was one kiss.
That's all, one kiss.

199
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,125
- You let him
stick it in you.

200
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,000
- No.
- I know you did.

201
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:17,291
I can smell
the sex on you.

202
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,000
And I'll be damned
if I raise your brats

203
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:23,834
after I wasted all
this time raising you!

204
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,750
Take off your drawers.
I'm checking you.

205
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:28,667
- No.

206
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,959
I said take 'em off.

207
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:34,834
- Get up here!

208
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:37,125
Auntie! No! No!

209
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,458
- Vivian!
Oh!

210
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:40,125
- You mind your business,
Vivian!

211
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,583
- Oh!
- Spread your legs!

212
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,333
- Vivvy!
- Spread 'em!

213
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:48,333
- Stop it! Stop!

214
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:05,000
- You're still a virgin.

215
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,125
- What is wrong with you?

216
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,667
- Yeah, you better hold her!
Hold her!

217
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,375
Next time you better be in this
house when I tell you to!

218
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:26,208
Dottie, come on.

219
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,625
Are you all right?

220
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:31,834
Auntie, she's just crazy.
She's crazy.

221
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,917
But that, what she did,
it don't mean nothin'.

222
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,083
It don't mean nothin'.

223
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,875
Didn't nothin' happen.

224
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,125
Didn't happen.
You hear me?

225
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,834
Didn't happen.

226
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:44,625
I can't wait
to get out of here.

227
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:46,417
When I'm rich and famous,
she ain't gonna see

228
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,583
a dime of my money,
you hear me?

229
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,667
- Yeah, I hear.
- Ain't gonna see a dime of it.

230
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:00,625
Look at Daddy.

231
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:03,208
Harold look just
like him, don't he?

232
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,917
Yeah.

233
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,417
What are you two
doing still up?

234
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,458
I bought us some pie.

235
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:26,542
It's still hot.

236
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,458
Everything all right?

237
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:29,959
- Everything's fine, Mama.

238
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,792
- We just wanted
to say good night.

239
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,083
- Oh.
My babies.

240
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,625
Have your pie tonight.

241
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,750
You know, Auntie does
the best she can by us.

242
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:46,750
I mean,
she tries really hard.

243
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:50,083
You do understand,
don't you?

244
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,542
Oh, well, good.

245
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:55,417
You save me a piece.
You know how I love pie.

dance me into my grave.

268
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,917
Hey, Geri.

269
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,542
- Get back out there.

270
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,166
You missed the last tap
on your turn.

271
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,875
- Oh. You know,
that hurt.

272
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:15,125
- Fayard.

273
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,750
- Geri,
every day you sit here,

274
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:23,917
bossing
little Fayard around,

275
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,250
reading
some old boring thing.

276
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,083
- I boss Fayard because
he likes to be bossed.

277
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,208
And I read Frederick Douglass
because I am trying

278
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,041
to learn something
about my people.

279
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,250
Want to borrow it?

280
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,000
- I'll tell you what
you need to learn.

281
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,250
You need to learn
how to have some fun.

282
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,792
Now, you and Fayard
need to come out

283
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,667
with me and Harold more often.

284
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,291
Besides, we need a chaperone.

285
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,750
Last night,
he asked me to touch it.

286
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,875
- You guys haven't...Harold!

287
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,500
Hey!

288
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:56,917
I made him take me home.

289
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,834
Harold Nicholas
took you home?

290
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,959
Girl, what kind of spell
are you puttin' on him?

291
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:05,291
- Says I'm the most beautiful
girl in the world.

292
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:09,875
- I'd rather be smart
than beautiful.

293
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,792
- Mmm,
I'd rather be beautiful.

294
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,792
- Oh, beauty fades.
A woman gets old.

295
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,709
- Mm-mm.
I'm not getting old.

296
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:18,375
I'm staying young
and beautiful

297
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,291
till the day I die.

298
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,041
Besides, being smart
doesn't get you

299
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:27,083
an engagement ring
from Harold Nicholas!

300
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,834

00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:53,208
before I mess up this hem?

311
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:57,333
- I think Harold'll marry me
with a torn hem, Mama.

312
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,709
How do I look, Vivvy?
- Perfect.

a fool, a no-good...

- Mm-mm, mm-mm.
Not today.

319
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:18,917
Today is a happy day.
Cyril is gone.

320
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,333
Same as bein' dead,

321
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:21,834
and that's the way
I like to think of it.

322
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:24,166
Dead, with God
and the good lamb.

323
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,959
- And anyway,
Harold is not Cyril.

324
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,792
- Honey, any man
with 5 cents'll pay

325
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,625
a colored woman's fare
all the way to nowhere.

326
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:35,041
You know what the chorus girls
say about Harold?

327
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,125
They say he's broken in
every bed

328
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,917
from here to New York City.

329
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,041
- That's right.
They do say that.

330
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,625
- And I don't care.

331
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:45,417
- Sugar pie, don't you have
somewhere you need to be?

332
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,875
- Harold Nicholas
is the richest,

333
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:49,917
most famous colored man
in the world.

334
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,083
He could have any girl
he wants,

335
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,792
and he wants me.

336
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,041
- Mmm.

337
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:58,458
- Harold Nicholas wants me.

338
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:01,583
Mm-hmm.

342
00:18:14,834 --> 00:18:16,875
You were always
lecturing us, Geri,

343
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,208
about there being a war on.

344
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,417
Remember?

345
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,417
Who cared about all
of that when there were

346
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,166
so many parties
to step out to?

347
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,417
Look at us.

What are you doin'?

351
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,583
Will you come to bed?

352
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,125
Dottie, you need any help?

353
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,792
- No, I'm...I'm fine.

354
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:56,291
- Then come on out and bring
my beautiful wife with you.

355
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,417
- Okay, I'm comin'.

356
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,667
Ooh. I can't see.

00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:04,959

362
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,166
Just relax, okay?

363
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,500

Don't.

368
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,542
Stop it!

369
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,875
I said no.

370
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:25,625
- Hey, we're married now.
It's okay.

371
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:28,667
Dottie,

372
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,750
is there
something wrong?

373
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:32,625
You can tell me.

374
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,125
- No.
I just don't want to.

375
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:44,041
- Dottie, you're...
you're my wife now.

376
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,959
What in the hell
did you think

377
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,792
marriage was gonna be about?

378
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:51,500
It's about intimacy,

379
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,583
and without it,
we've got nothing.

380
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,500
Dottie, without sex,

381
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,709
marriage goes right
down the drain.

382
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:02,917
Okay?

383
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,041
Come on, now.

384
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:09,750
Don't be scared.

385
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:13,000
You're gonna enjoy it,
I promise you.

386
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,083
I guarantee it.
- Mm.

387
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:22,583
No. No, Harold,
I can't.

388
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:24,583
No! No! No!

389
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:26,250
Get off of me!
- Dottie.

390
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,375
- Get off of me!
- Hey.

391
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,750
- Get off of me!
Get off of me!

392
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,792
- What the hell am I doing?
Am I crazy?

393
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,417
You don't want me.

394
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,625
Fine.

395
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:44,208
Then it's over.

396
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,333
We'll get
the whole thing annulled.

397
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:48,041
It's over.

398
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:55,959
Good night.

399
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,000
Harold.

400
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,458
I'm sorry.

401
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:31,750
I don't want an annulment.

402
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:33,583
I just want you
to understand

403
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:36,834
that I had a different
kind of life, that's all.

404
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:41,417
Can you give me
another chance?

405
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,583
Hmm?
Can I try it again?

406
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,667
Please?

407
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:00,083
We try it again.

408
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:09,458
- You have got to let us
get you to a hospital.

409
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:11,333
- No, no.

410
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:14,083
Harold's coming.
- Where in the hell is he?

411
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:16,041
- Couldn't miss his golf game.

412
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:19,417
- Vivvy, get her purse.

413
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,458
This little one is
not waitin' for him,

414
00:23:21,542 --> 00:23:22,375
and neither can you.

415
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:23,667
Come on.
- No, Geri!

416
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,000
- Come on.
- No, Geri! I'm not going!

417
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,375
- No, we've got to go.
- No!

418
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,291
- Come on.
- I'm waiting for Harold!

419
00:23:33,709 --> 00:23:34,959
Hmm.

420
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:37,166
- Mama, you're gonna
wear a groove in the floor.

421
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,709
- Is it a boy or a girl?

422
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:46,792
- She waited for you
for hours...hours.

423
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:49,500
- Everything's all right,
isn't it?

424
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,875
Dottie?
Everything's okay, isn't it?

425
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:53,542
It's a girl.

426
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,250
And she's fine.

427
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,000
- No thanks to you.

428
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:01,583
Go ahead.
Have a look at her.

429
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,750
6 pounds, 2 ounces.

430
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:12,500
I named her Harolyn,

431
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,333
and we're going
to call her Lynn.

432
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,792
Harold wanted to send her
to finishing school

433
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,458
in Switzerland.

434
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:26,709
Thought she could learn
to speak French.

435
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:28,083
French.

436
00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:33,750
He always had big dreams.

437
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,667
Bigger than us.

438
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:49,125
Lynn, honey?

439
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:51,959
Can you speak
to Dr. Carrington?

440
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,291
Hmm?

441
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:55,375
Lynn?

442
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,125
Can you say Mama? Hmm?

443
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:58,458
- Say Mama.

444
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,834
- I guess some children
are just slow to speak.

445
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:07,792
- Mrs. Nicholas, I know this
is very difficult for you,

446
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:09,500
but she will never speak.

447
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:11,083
- No. No, no, see, I...

448
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:12,500
I've been
to all these doctors

449
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:14,125
and I have all
these medicines.

450
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:16,083
One doctor said that
she needed sedatives,

451
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:19,083
another one said stimulants,
and I've been massaging

452
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:21,667
her forehead every morning
just like Dr. Gray said.

453
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,542
And Dr. Matthews said that he
thought it was hot baths,

454
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,375
so I've been giving her
hot baths every night.

455
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:29,250
And then we had, um,
these tests done on her

456
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:31,542
and they injected fluid
in her spine,

457
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:32,959
and that doctor said
he thought

458
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:34,667
that she just needed
to eat a little bit more.

459
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,500
- Mrs. Nicholas.
- They were good doctors.

460
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:38,959
- If they were such good
doctors, why are you here?

461
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,709
- Because nobody's told me

462
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:48,500
how to get my baby
to call me Mama.

463
00:25:54,792 --> 00:25:57,709
- Dorothy,
Lynn is mentally retarded.

464
00:25:57,792 --> 00:26:01,166
She has what we call
anoxic brain damage.

465
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,291
There wasn't a sufficient supply
of oxygen for her

466
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,041
during delivery.

467
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:07,083
- I was late getting her
to the hospital.

468
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,750
Do you think it...it was
my fault, wasn't it?

469
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:09,709
No.

470
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,166
No one knows what causes it,

471
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,166
but I'm sure that that had
nothing to do with it.

472
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,875
- Well, what's
the treatment, Doctor?

473
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:17,583
Because if it's money,
that's not an issue...

474
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:18,709
Dorothy.

475
00:26:18,792 --> 00:26:20,583
Her brain
will never develop.

476
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:22,417
She'll be four years old
forever.

477
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,917
- But, I mean...but they...
they said that...

478
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,583
- I'm sorry.

479
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:30,792
I'm a mother myself.

480
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:32,875
My advice to you is
to put her in an institution

481
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:35,250
where she can get
the best possible care.

482
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,083
- I can't do that.

483
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:39,125
- You're a young woman.
You can have other children.

484
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:46,250
- Lynn?

485
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:48,625
Lynn, honey,
try another note.

486
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:49,750
Come on, sweetie.

487
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:51,375
There are other notes
for you to play.

488
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:53,750
- Dottie, we should take
the doctor's advice

489
00:26:53,834 --> 00:26:55,417
and put her in an institution.

490
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,959
She knows best.

491
00:26:57,041 --> 00:26:58,500
The state'll pay for it.

492
00:26:58,583 --> 00:26:59,959
- The state pays for what?

493
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:02,417
It's our child.
She belongs with us.

494
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,417
- We belong in Paris.
That's where we belong.

495
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,500
- Paris?

496
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,917
What are you talking about?

497
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,125
- Dottie, it's a whole different
ball game over there.

498
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:13,625
See, they don't know
the difference

499
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:15,375
between black and white,
and when they do,

500
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:18,125
it's because they're treating us
better than they do their own.

501
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:20,166
- I can't go live in Paris.

502
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,250
Lynn is gonna need
special care.

503
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:23,458
- Get special care.

504
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:24,959
- Not in an institution!

505
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:29,959
- She doesn't even know
that we're here.

506
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,875
- I can't even believe
this is what you're saying.

507
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:39,041
- When will you join me?

508
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:42,834
- I'm her mother,
and you are her father.

509
00:27:42,917 --> 00:27:45,166
- And I married you,

510
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,166
not this.

511
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,917
- Well, I am this.
What are you?

512
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:54,000
- I'm Harold Nicholas
of the Nicholas Brothers,

513
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:57,000
and maybe
that's all I'm supposed to be.

514
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:59,375
I'll send you money from Paris.

515
00:28:19,709 --> 00:28:23,542
The best part was
she didn't know he was gone.

516
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:27,458
So she never even missed him.

517
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,917
How many times
did I tell you, Geri,

518
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,041
that the next man
would be different?

519
00:28:42,542 --> 00:28:43,959
It's funny.

520
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:46,333
You never notice the good ones
when you should.

521
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:05,875
- Listen, so, uh, we're just
taking a cigarette break?

522
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:07,041
- All right.
- Ha ha!

523
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,709
Not ready to leave yet,
are you?

524
00:29:08,792 --> 00:29:10,041
Oh, no, no, no.

525
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:20,625
- Welcome to Fillmore's
Ring-a-ding swing-a-ding.

526
00:29:20,709 --> 00:29:22,250
- Thanks.

527
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:23,667
Ring-a-ding much.

528
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,125
Where is Swing-a-ding Phil,
anyway?

529
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:28,333
- Coo-chee-cooin'
the elephant.

530
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:29,834
- Hmm?
- You know.

531
00:29:29,917 --> 00:29:31,083
Ticklin' the ivories.

532
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:32,959
- Funny, in my day,
we used to call it

533
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,208
playing the piano.

534
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:37,125
- When was your day?
- Preceding thy genesis.

535
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,125
- Huh?

536
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:39,417
- Before you were born.

537
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:45,667
Sorry.
'Scuse me.

538
00:29:46,709 --> 00:29:47,875
'Scuse me.

539
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:51,166
'Scuse me.

540
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:57,625
Nice party, Phil.

541
00:29:57,709 --> 00:29:58,875
- Earl.

542
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Have a drink.
Have a couple.

543
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:04,083
Oops!

544
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:06,458
Ha ha ha!

545
00:30:06,542 --> 00:30:08,291
- I didn't come for
a drink, Phil,

546
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:09,834
and I didn't come
for a party.

547
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:12,000
I left a meeting because
you said there was a girl

548
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:14,083
I just had to hear.

549
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:17,000
- Aw, Earl, don't be mad.

550
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:21,750
- I manage your music career,
Phil, not your harem tryouts.

551
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:23,625
- Oh, well, uh,

552
00:30:23,709 --> 00:30:26,625
girl's around here somewhere.

553
00:30:26,709 --> 00:30:28,291

Who was that?

569
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:47,208
- Just legs from my harem.

570
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:59,125
- Which one of you
was just singing?

571
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,041
- Why do you want to know?

572
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:03,959
- Because whoever sang
that song,

573
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:05,834
I'm gonna make her a star.

574
00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:07,917
- Well, we don't even
know your name.

575
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,792
- I'm Earl Mills.
I'm a music manager.

576
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:13,834
- Well, Earl Mills,
the music manager,

577
00:32:13,917 --> 00:32:15,750
I'm Ava Gardner.

578
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:18,917
- My name's Marilyn Monroe.

579
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,583
- I'm Dorothy Dandridge.

580
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:27,875
- You got a face like an angel,
you know that?

581
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,333
You sang that song.

582
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,250
- I'm not a singer,
Mr. Mills, I'm an actress.

583
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,250
- Of course you are,
but, uh,

584
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:44,667
maybe between movie roles
you'd like to sing a little bit.

585
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,959
- No, I'm a serious actress.
I'm studying at the Actors Lab.

586
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:50,458
- Ooh. My, my.
Actors Lab.

587
00:32:50,542 --> 00:32:53,583
Look, forgive me, but things'll
go better for you

588
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:55,625
in this business
if you're a singer.

589
00:32:55,709 --> 00:32:58,333
- I've got a major role
in a major motion picture.

590
00:32:58,417 --> 00:32:59,875
Starts shooting next week.

591
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:01,417
- Hey.

592
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,625
What's the big role?

593
00:33:03,709 --> 00:33:05,291
- Queen Melmendi.

594
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:09,834
- Ah.

595
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:41,709
- Geez!
- Cut!

596
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:44,250
Look, will somebody please
pre-cut the ropes?

597
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:46,125
I mean, Lex is fumbling
all over the place!

598
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:47,750
Yeah, okay, do it!

599
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:49,500
- Yes, sir, yes, sir.
Right away.

600
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:51,667
Tommy?
- Excuse me.

601
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,917
- What?
- I was wondering.

602
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,375
Queen Melmendi is queen
of the jungle, right?

603
00:33:56,458 --> 00:33:59,000
Well, if she lives here,
then why does she need Tarzan

604
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,375
to help her find
her way through it?

605
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:02,667
- What's your name?
- Dorothy.

606
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,041
- Dorothy. Okay.
Dorothy, sweetheart?

607
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:06,375
Can you do something
for me, please?

608
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:08,291
- Mm-hmm.
- Good. Would you go lie down,

609
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:09,583
let me see more skin
than cloth,

610
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:12,792
and keep the queen
of the fucking Congo quiet?

611
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:14,709
Jimmy, fetch me a Coca-Cola!

612
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:16,667
Coming up, sir.

613
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,375
- Look, I want to
see more skin, okay?

614
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:19,834
I don't care what we have
to do...

615
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:23,125
- Hey, Sammy, got a smoke?
- Sure thing.

616
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:34,959
- Boy, that was, uh...

617
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:38,333
What happened to your face?

618
00:34:38,417 --> 00:34:41,291
- Guess I wasn't black enough
to lead the tribe.

619
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:45,208
- Go ahead, say it.
You were right.

620
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,917
- I was right.

621
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,041
But you were right,
too, you know.

622
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:51,083
Queen Melmendi would definitely
know the way

623
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:52,917
out of her own jungle.

624
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,041
I'm willing to bet...

625
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:58,417
She still does.

626
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:08,500
Come on.
Just give me one last hug.

627
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:11,125
Come on, sweetheart.
Thank you.

628
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:12,166
Oh!

629
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,375
- Dottie Mae, honey,
let's go.

630
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:15,333
You're gonna miss
your plane.

631
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:18,500
- Mmm.

632
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:22,083
Okay, sweetheart,
listen.

633
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:24,917
Your nurse,
she's very nice, honey.

634
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,750
She's even got a piano.
Ha!

635
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,208
You're gonna like living here.

636
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:32,458
I know you will.
Look, look.

637
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:33,625
Remember the locket

638
00:35:33,709 --> 00:35:35,542
I gave you, huh?

639
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:37,542
This means...

640
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:40,250
- That I belong to you

641
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:43,125
and you belong to me,
okay?

642
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:45,583
And when you miss me,
you just grab it,

643
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:48,834
you just hold on to it
real tight, okay?

644
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:50,542
And I'll be there.

645
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:53,083
Okay?

646
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:56,000
Come with me, Lynn.

647
00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:07,625
- I don't know, Mama.

648
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:09,542
Maybe I should stay here
and help her or somethin'.

649
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,333
- Now, Dottie Mae,
we talked about this.

650
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:13,208
You're not gettin' enough
from your divorce settlement.

651
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:16,333
You don't work, you're not gonna
be able to pay that nurse.

652
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:19,875
I'd take care of Lynn myself,
I would,

653
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:21,000
but I gotta work, too.

654
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:23,959
I'm always at the studios.

655
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:27,291
Now, you got to think
of your career first.

656
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:31,792
Dottie Mae, that child don't
even know who you are.

657
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:35,166
- It's so hard for me
just to leave her, Mama.

658
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,041
I know, baby, I know,

659
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:39,834
but you got to pull
yourself together, honey.

660
00:36:39,917 --> 00:36:42,834
We cannot keep
Miami Beach a-waitin'.

661
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:45,667
Take her in the house, honey.
Take her on in the house.

662
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:59,834
It's great to be
back here in Miami Beach...

663
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,500
- Uh...

664
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:03,500
we're gonna be staying
at a hotel.

665
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:06,542
It's, uh, just outside
the city limits.

666
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:07,834
- Mm-hmm.

667
00:37:07,917 --> 00:37:10,500
- And, uh, I...I think
we should probably use

668
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:12,208
the service entrance
when we come in here,

669
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:14,333
- don't you think?
- Mm-hmm.

670
00:37:14,417 --> 00:37:17,417
- Oh, and don't...don't talk
to any of the patrons...

671
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,458
- Earl, just say it.

672
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:21,625
- What?

673
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:24,542
- You think I've never
been to the South?

674
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:26,208
I can't stay in Miami Beach,

675
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:27,667
I can't use the front entrance,

676
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,500
and I can't speak
to the patrons, right?

677
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,917
This isn't a tan, Earl.

678
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,667
I'm a Negro,
a colored girl.

679
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,250
You did happen
to notice that, didn't you?

680
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:38,875
- I noticed.

681
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:40,417
- Now, listen, if we're going
to work together,

682
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,083
you can't tiptoe around me.

683
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:45,750
You have to say it
straight out.

684
00:37:45,834 --> 00:37:47,417
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good.

685
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,709
Now, come on, honey.

686
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:50,625
Zip me up so I can run
to the bathroom.

687
00:37:50,709 --> 00:37:52,250
Come on.

688
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,083
- This is your bathroom.

689
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:03,625
You told me to say it
straight out.

690
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:04,583
Angel face.

691
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:05,959
- I think President Truman's

692
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:07,917
done a lot for the country.

693
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,709
For one,
he moved to the city.

694
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:14,208
You're a wonderful crowd,
and this is a classy joint.

695
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:15,542
- Dorothy, wait.

696
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:16,792
They even have
midget waiters here.

697
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:18,291
- What?

698
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:19,750
- Look at this place.

699
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:22,291
- I asked one waiter to put
a phone on my table,

700
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:25,291
but he couldn't get
the booth off the wall.

701
00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:28,875
Boy, can the people
drink here.

702
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:30,625
One guy stumbled out
of here last night,

703
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:33,625
bumped into a uniformed
man outside.

704
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:34,667
He say, "Hey, buddy"...

705
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,291
- I can't perform here.

706
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:39,083
- I've seen worse.
At least they paid.

707
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:40,834
- You go find the owner,
and you tell him

708
00:38:40,917 --> 00:38:43,667
I'm not performing inside
this disaster area!

709
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,291
- Oh, really?
There's the owner right there.

710
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:49,125
You want to ruin your career,
you can tell him yourself.

711
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:50,125
- Fine. I will.

712
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:51,750
- Dorothy, wait, wait.

713
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:53,291
I was kidding.
Let me handle this.

714
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:54,583
- Mr. Scott?
- No. Dorothy.

715
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:56,166
- Mr. Scott?
- I'll handle it.

716
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,083
- Dandridge. Good. You're on
right after this joke.

717
00:38:58,166 --> 00:38:59,834
- I'm the manager.
She's not going on after him...

718
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:01,542
- Because I'm not performing!
- Shh!

719
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:03,333
- What did you say?
- She won't work in a place

720
00:39:03,417 --> 00:39:05,500
where she has to enter stage
rear, sleep outside the city...

721
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:06,750
- Or use a Dixie cup!

722
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:09,250
- Quiet.
Or use a Dixie cup.

723
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:12,834
All right.
- What?

724
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,667
He says, "Don't worry.
I'll see you on Friday."

725
00:39:15,834 --> 00:39:17,959
- You see that man
sitting at table two?

726
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:20,000
That's the city
building commissioner.

727
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:22,542
When he found out
I was opening a club

728
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:25,333
where colored acts share
dressing rooms with whites,

729
00:39:25,417 --> 00:39:28,417
he held up my construction
permits until tonight,

730
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,625
and most of these people
are his friends.

731
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:34,333
You see
that busboy there?

732
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:36,333
His name
is Corey Williams.

733
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:38,959
He earned the Silver Star
at Guadalcanal,

734
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:42,000
came home,
got his degree on the GI Bill.

735
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:44,000
But no one would hire him

736
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:45,917
except me.

737
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,834
Now, I tried to get
as many of my friends here

738
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:50,542
to support
what I'm trying to do,

739
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:54,000
but tonight my friends
are few and far between.

740
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,500
So if you don't wanna
perform,

741
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:58,458
I don't blame you,

742
00:39:58,542 --> 00:40:00,041
but don't blame me.

743
00:40:02,542 --> 00:40:03,667
- Well, it's been a pleasure

744
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,375
playing
the Miami Beach Mortuary.

745
00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:07,041
May you all rest in peace.

746
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:09,000
Good night,
ladies and gentlemen.

747
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:17,709
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

748
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:20,291
- Oh.
Got any advice?

749
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:22,417
- Yeah.
Kill 'em.

750
00:40:24,917 --> 00:40:25,750
- Thank you.

751
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:47,417
- Good evening.

752
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,291

- And Ava Gardner,

805
00:44:45,834 --> 00:44:47,792
she's got another film now...
- Vivvy.

806
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:50,333
- I can't help it
if your name's not in here.

807
00:44:50,417 --> 00:44:51,834
- I'll get another role soon.

808
00:44:51,917 --> 00:44:54,333
- Oh, yeah, I see right here
where Hollywood's

809
00:44:54,417 --> 00:44:56,417
just begging Negroes
to star in their films.

810
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,583
- Why do you have to be
so gloomy?

811
00:44:58,667 --> 00:45:01,000
- Because I haven't worked
in two years,

812
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:03,834
and let's not mention
your last big role.

813
00:45:03,917 --> 00:45:08,333
- "Bright Road"?
That was a very important film.

814
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:10,041
- Important to who?

815
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:11,375
It's practically
breaking records

816
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:14,000
for the lowest box office
in the South.

817
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:15,333
- Thank you, Vivvy.

818
00:45:15,417 --> 00:45:18,667
That was the cherry
on the pie of my week.

819
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,834
- I am having
a really great day.

820
00:45:27,333 --> 00:45:28,625
Okay, I'll tell ya.

821
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:31,875
Fox is doing a film
of Bizet's "Carmen."

822
00:45:31,959 --> 00:45:34,625
Lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein.

823
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:36,875
- Whoop-de-doo.

824
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:40,000
- Oh, that's right.
I didn't say.

825
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:43,000
They're using
an all-Negro cast.

826
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:50,875
Yeah.

827
00:45:50,959 --> 00:45:53,000
- Do you know how many colored
actresses want this part?

828
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,083
Every colored actress:

829
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:56,500
Lena Horne, Eartha Kitt,
everybody.

830
00:45:56,583 --> 00:45:57,750
"Carmen Jones"
is the best part

831
00:45:57,834 --> 00:45:59,917
for a Negro actress in years.
Ever.

832
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,750
Hey, she is Carmen.

833
00:46:01,834 --> 00:46:03,333
- You should have seen her run
at La Vie en Rose.

834
00:46:03,417 --> 00:46:05,542
They were literally handing out
the "Kinsey" sex report

835
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:06,875
at the door,
she's so hot.

836
00:46:06,959 --> 00:46:08,583
- Okay, that was New York,
not Hollywood.

837
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:09,959
That was a nightclub
and not high drama.

838
00:46:10,041 --> 00:46:11,500
And I've seen
her last two pictures,

839
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:13,375
and that's all, folks.

840
00:46:13,458 --> 00:46:16,291
- Oh, come on, she's been shoved
into nothing but banana hats

841
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:19,417
and curled slippers for a year,
and you know it, Joey.

842
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,625
Now, come on.

843
00:46:20,709 --> 00:46:22,208
Joey, just get her
a reading with Preminger.

844
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:23,542
That's all I'm asking.

845
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:24,959
- Just a reading?

846
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:26,750
Just Otto Preminger?

847
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:28,959
Do you know what I do
every morning, Earl?

848
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:30,417
- No, Joe.

849
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,208
- I get up every morning
at 5:00 am when it's still dark,

850
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:33,959
and I drive all the way
from the Valley to the studio,

851
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,375
and along the way,
I see faces.

852
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:38,917
Faces on billboards,
faces on bench ads.

853
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,959
Familiar faces.

854
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:42,166
Famous faces.

855
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,959
The faces of movie stars.

856
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:46,959
The faces that I see
out of my car window

857
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:49,917
are the faces for whom I get
readings with Otto Preminger.

858
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,625
And not once,
in all my drives,

859
00:46:51,709 --> 00:46:53,959
have I ever seen the face

860
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:56,792
of Dorothy Dandridge.

861
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:58,625
Now, good night.

862
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:58,709
- I wonder, why did Joey Young
decide to get me a reading?

863
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:02,375
- Apparently he saw you from his
car window one morning.

864
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:04,083
No kidding?

865
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:05,375
- No kidding.

866
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:10,166
- Mr. Preminger
will see you now.

867
00:48:17,792 --> 00:48:18,792
- What?

868
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:20,583
- I just realized
this is the moment

869
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:22,750
I've always dreamed of.

870
00:48:22,834 --> 00:48:24,625
- Your reading
with Preminger?

871
00:48:24,709 --> 00:48:26,709
- A chance.

872
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:31,667
- Oh...

873
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,125
let me handle this,
will ya?

874
00:49:19,709 --> 00:49:21,166
Mr. Preminger?

875
00:49:29,417 --> 00:49:31,208
- Mr. Preminger,

876
00:49:31,291 --> 00:49:34,291
I'd like you to meet
Carmen Jones.

877
00:49:34,375 --> 00:49:36,917
- Ooh.
Ha ha ha.

878
00:49:40,417 --> 00:49:42,417
Carmen Jones?

879
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,083
No.

880
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:49,875
I will give her a reading
for the role of Cindy Lou.

881
00:49:49,959 --> 00:49:52,625
- Cindy Lou?

882
00:49:52,709 --> 00:49:54,125
Isn't that the sweet girl

883
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:55,625
that gets dumped for Carmen?

884
00:49:55,709 --> 00:49:57,083
- There must be
a misunderstanding.

885
00:49:57,166 --> 00:49:58,291
- 'Scuse me?

886
00:49:58,375 --> 00:49:59,834
- I said there must be
a misunderstanding.

887
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:01,125
Miss Dandridge is here

888
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:03,542
to read for the part
of Carmen.

889
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,000
- You have come
into my office,

890
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:06,959
but you have not brought
Carmen with you.

891
00:50:07,041 --> 00:50:09,834
You have brought
yourself with you.

892
00:50:09,917 --> 00:50:13,041
Good little girl,
nice gloves...

893
00:50:13,125 --> 00:50:17,000
asking for a reading
for the role of a wild woman.

894
00:50:17,083 --> 00:50:18,875
You are not Carmen.
You're Cindy Lou.

895
00:50:18,959 --> 00:50:20,375
- But Mister...
- Dorothy is an actress,

896
00:50:20,458 --> 00:50:22,583
Mr. Preminger.
- She is Cindy Lou.

897
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:26,166
- I'm sure if you'd just
give her the opportunity...

898
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:27,667
- This is final.

899
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:34,291
- You know what you are,
Mr. Preminger?

900
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:36,208
- Dorothy.
- You're a bulldog.

901
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:38,333
You're a big,
fat bulldog!

902
00:50:38,417 --> 00:50:40,375
That's what you are.

903
00:50:40,458 --> 00:50:42,166
- What did you call me?

904
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,959
- A bulldog.

905
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:47,542
She's...nervous.

906
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:50,250
Thank you for your time.

907
00:50:50,333 --> 00:50:52,709
Cindy Lou.

908
00:50:52,792 --> 00:50:54,959
We'll look at Cindy Lou.

909
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:04,000
Oh, she's on every page.

910
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:05,542
Look at this!
- What part?

911
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:08,041
Who's gonna play this part?
I can play this part.

912
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:09,959
They'd never see me,
though, would they, Mama?

913
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:12,250
- I'm not going back
to read for Cindy Lou.

914
00:51:12,333 --> 00:51:14,709
Don't know why you're
still lookin' at that.

915
00:51:14,792 --> 00:51:17,166
- You should be grateful
he's considering you for a part.

916
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:18,583
I couldn't get
an audition if I tried.

917
00:51:18,667 --> 00:51:20,500
- I don't want to be
Cindy Lou.

918
00:51:20,583 --> 00:51:22,291
So that's what
you gonna do?

919
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:23,875
Just give up?

920
00:51:23,959 --> 00:51:25,625
- He won't give me a chance,
Mama.

921
00:51:25,709 --> 00:51:27,583
- Well, if you're waitin'
for them to give you a chance,

922
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,208
you're gonna have
a hard row to hoe.

923
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:31,250
Honey, you have got
to take your chances.

924
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:33,667
Now, you think about Carmen.

925
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:37,625
This girl is all about sex.

926
00:51:37,709 --> 00:51:39,417
She looks like sex.

927
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,875
She smells like sex.

928
00:51:42,959 --> 00:51:46,083
She even moves, you know,
she moves like sex.

929
00:51:46,166 --> 00:51:48,125
- Mm-hmm,
that's the way.

930
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:50,417
Use the equipment
Mama gave you.

931
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:54,041
You got to walk in there
like Carmen.

932
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:56,417
- But that old bulldog won't
even let me read for Carmen.

933
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,750
- Honey, we're not talkin'
'bout readin'.

934
00:51:58,834 --> 00:52:01,875
We're talkin' 'bout
walkin'.

935
00:52:05,333 --> 00:52:07,458
Now, you can get
this part.

936
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:08,750
- By walkin'.

937
00:52:13,542 --> 00:52:16,542
Have you seen my man?

938
00:52:29,542 --> 00:52:32,458
That Carmen Jones
snatched him from me,

939
00:52:32,542 --> 00:52:35,583
and I'm lost over what
to do about it.

940
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:38,625
Can't decide

941
00:52:38,709 --> 00:52:41,959
if it's better me follow him
up to the Windy City...

942
00:52:43,667 --> 00:52:46,041
Or should I wait...

943
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:51,583
For him to come back
to his happy hearth and home?

944
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:53,917
Tell me what to do.

945
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,792
I'm Cindy Lou.

946
00:52:58,959 --> 00:53:00,625
- The hell you are.

947
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:09,333
- Girl, I was Carmen.

948
00:53:09,417 --> 00:53:11,000
"Miss Dandridge,
can I get you this?"

949
00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:12,667
"Miss Dandridge, can I
get you that?"

950
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,250
Remember, they hired
that opera singer

951
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:17,083
to come do
my movie singin' for me?

952
00:53:17,166 --> 00:53:19,291
Mm-hmm.

953
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:21,417
They did.

954
00:53:22,291 --> 00:53:25,166
Then one morning I woke up,

955
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,542
and I just couldn't breathe.

956
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:31,083
- What are you telling me?
She won't make the picture?

957
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,542
I start shooting tomorrow!
Wonderful!

958
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:35,375
Where is she?
- She won't do it.

959
00:53:35,458 --> 00:53:37,333
I've talked to her
three times.

960
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:38,583
She won't do it.

961
00:53:38,667 --> 00:53:40,250
She doesn't want
to anger the Negro community.

962
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:43,709
- "Anger the Negro community."
That's ridiculous!

963
00:53:43,792 --> 00:53:46,000
The first all-Negro film!

964
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:47,875
First released
by a major studio!

965
00:53:47,959 --> 00:53:50,041
- Yes, in which she plays
a Negro whore.

966
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:52,375
- It's not a whore!
It's a woman, not a whore.

967
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:55,583
- Otto, Otto.
A critic suggested

968
00:53:55,667 --> 00:53:57,458
that Hollywood depicts
all Negro women

969
00:53:57,542 --> 00:54:00,542
as either mammies
or prostitutes.

970
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:02,375
- Yeah, but this is...
it confuse me.

971
00:54:02,458 --> 00:54:03,959
First the studio
won't approve the film

972
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:05,500
because it's all-Negro.

973
00:54:05,583 --> 00:54:06,875
Then they will do the film,

974
00:54:06,959 --> 00:54:10,250
but only if the NAACP
also approves.

975
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:12,458
Now Miss Dandridge
won't make the film

976
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:14,792
because
even though the NAACP

977
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:18,125
and the studio approve...

978
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:21,417
one man who writes one article
does not.

979
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:29,875
She's scared, yes?

980
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:34,166
- Yeah.
Terrified.

981
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:54,709
Otto.

982
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,083
You're not really the asshole
you seem to be, are you?

983
00:54:59,166 --> 00:55:02,625
- This, little gentleman,
is something neither you

984
00:55:02,709 --> 00:55:06,875
nor anyone else
will ever know.

985
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:19,250
- Earl, go away!

986
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:21,458
I've already
made up my mind!

987
00:55:21,542 --> 00:55:23,959
It's not Earl.
Open.

988
00:55:34,834 --> 00:55:36,208
Miss Dandridge.

989
00:55:38,709 --> 00:55:40,041
- Call me Dorothy.

990
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:43,125
Most...directors that barge
in my house usually do.

991
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:04,458
- You decline
to play Carmen?

992
00:56:04,542 --> 00:56:07,041
- I've already proven
I could get the part.

993
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:09,500
No real reason
for me to play it.

994
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:10,667
- Hmm.

995
00:56:11,959 --> 00:56:15,291
Maybe you are not good enough
to play the role.

996
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:17,834
Maybe you have no talent.

997
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:20,959
- I've got more talent
than anybody in this town.

998
00:56:21,041 --> 00:56:23,250
You won't find
a better Carmen than me.

999
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:26,250
- So, you know you can do it,
I know you can do it.

1000
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:29,625
That's not your fear.
It's the gamble.

1001
00:56:31,792 --> 00:56:33,583
- What would you know
about that?

1002
00:56:33,667 --> 00:56:36,917
- I, too, am taking big gambles
on this picture.

1003
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,208
If it doesn't work,

1004
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:40,875
then everybody will say
Otto Preminger is a fool

1005
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:44,166
thinking he can make
a all-Negro musical.

1006
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:47,083
And if I succeed,
then I will be a genius.

1007
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:51,959
You know how I know
it will work?

1008
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:54,500
Because I have my Carmen.

1009
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:58,625
I have you.

1010
00:57:07,709 --> 00:57:09,250
- What if they don't like me?

1011
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:11,250
- They will love you.

1012
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:13,667
I will make them love you.

1013
00:57:14,667 --> 00:57:17,166
I may be a...old bulldog,

1014
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:20,000
with a bald head,
but this is what I can do.

1015
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:21,458
- I didn't mean to say that.

1016
00:57:21,542 --> 00:57:24,333
- No, no. It's all right.
I know I'm ugly.

1017
00:57:24,417 --> 00:57:28,250
My gift is to bring
the beauty

1018
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:30,500
to the world.

1019
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:34,875
I know women.

1020
00:57:34,959 --> 00:57:37,333
I know how to light them,
to shoot them,

1021
00:57:37,417 --> 00:57:40,041
to create them
for the screen.

1022
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:42,291
And if you let me,

1023
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:45,291
I will seduce the audience
for you.

1024
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:46,959
I will make sure

1025
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:50,333
that they will never forget
the name Dorothy Dandridge.

1026
00:57:50,417 --> 00:57:53,125
I will make the name
shine brighter

1027
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:56,250
than all the lights here

1028
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:58,417
in our city.

1029
00:58:00,166 --> 00:58:01,291
- Otto...

1030
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:05,375
You're not so ugly.

1031
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:24,417
- Sir, we're ready to go.
Are you?

1032
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,417
- Are we ready? Really?
I don't think so.

1033
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,125
I mean, this has to be here.
Move it.

1034
00:58:29,208 --> 00:58:31,250
The food has to steam, steam!

1035
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:33,291
It's...it's hot, not cold.

1036
00:58:33,375 --> 00:58:34,709
What about here, the flowers?

1037
00:58:34,792 --> 00:58:37,333
That's ridiculous!
Get rid of them.

1038
00:58:37,417 --> 00:58:39,417
We are not in a restaurant.
We are in a mess hall.

1039
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,125
What's here?
That's red.

1040
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:44,000
I said no one wears red.
Put a...a blue scarf...

1041
00:58:44,083 --> 00:58:45,709
- You know what? Forget about it.
- I'll take that.

1042
00:58:45,792 --> 00:58:47,083
- Put that to the back.

1043
00:58:47,166 --> 00:58:49,792
And where's my coffee?
Is that too much to...

1044
00:58:49,875 --> 00:58:51,542
- Right here, sir.
- Cup of coffee?

1045
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:52,917
Where's Miss Dandridge?

1046
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,875
- Still in her
dressing room, sir.

1047
00:58:53,959 --> 00:58:55,208
- Oh, that's fine.

1048
00:58:55,291 --> 00:58:56,875
Well, please let her
know that we are ready

1049
00:58:56,959 --> 00:58:58,375
and she should join us.

1050
00:58:58,458 --> 00:58:59,542
Not bad.

1051
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:01,875
She's late for
the first shooting day.

1052
00:59:01,959 --> 00:59:04,250
Who else is late here?

1053
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:07,250
- Otto...
- Who the hell are you?

1054
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:10,458
- I'm Earl.
- Get just out of my way.

1055
00:59:16,625 --> 00:59:18,750
Good day,
Miss Dandridge.

1056
00:59:18,834 --> 00:59:21,542
- Good day, Mr. Preminger.

1057
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:23,542
Oh, this is ridiculous.

1058
00:59:23,625 --> 00:59:25,583
I'm gonna lay it out.

1059
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:31,667
- I have to tell you,

1060
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:32,917
rule number one:

1061
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,125
never be late on a set.

1062
00:59:38,959 --> 00:59:41,375
- Okay, folks, quiet down,
settle down.

1063
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:43,083
Okay, this is gonna be
for picture,

1064
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:45,250
ladies and gentlemen.
Let's make it a good one.

1065
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:48,083
Folks, just like I said,
just like we rehearsed.

1066
00:59:48,166 --> 00:59:50,083
Okay? Nice, comfortable meal.
- Thank you.

1067
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:51,750
Nice conversation.
No extra noise.

1068
00:59:51,834 --> 00:59:53,583
No silverware clattering,
none of that, okay?

1069
00:59:53,667 --> 00:59:57,166
We'll do that later. Okay!
First positions, everybody.

1070
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:06,750
You look
as good as me.

1071
01:00:11,917 --> 01:00:13,166
- Roll 'em.

1072
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:14,250
- Roll 'em!

1073
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:15,917
Speed.

1074
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,375
- Scene 30, take one.
Marker.

1075
01:00:18,458 --> 01:00:19,667
- Background!

1076
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:23,166
- Action!

1077
01:00:31,834 --> 01:00:33,834
- Hmm.
Congratulations, Corporal.

1078
01:00:33,917 --> 01:00:35,625
That Airs Corps sure was smart
in pickin' you out

1079
01:00:35,709 --> 01:00:37,750
of this whole outfit
for the officers' flying school.

1080
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,417
Thanks.

1081
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,125
- Hi, Carmen.
- Hi.

1082
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:44,792
Well! Get a load of this
hip-swingin' floozy

1083
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:47,709
rollin' round to work
in time for lunch.

1084
01:00:47,792 --> 01:00:48,750
- Prune puss,

1085
01:00:48,834 --> 01:00:50,291
you make sounds
I don't like.

1086
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:52,792
- I'ma tell the foreman
you was late again.

1087
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:54,291
- You do that,
and I'll scratch out

1088
01:00:54,375 --> 01:00:56,458
the one good eye
you got left.

1089
01:00:56,542 --> 01:00:58,333
- Hey, Carmen, why don't you
come to Pastor's

1090
01:00:58,417 --> 01:00:59,500
with me tonight?

1091
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:01,750
I can dance those other boys
off the floor.

1092
01:01:01,834 --> 01:01:04,125
- T-Bone, you're too little
and too late.

1093
01:01:04,208 --> 01:01:06,625
- I don't waste no time.
Dig me, baby?

1094
01:01:06,709 --> 01:01:08,458
- Wasting your time right now,
Sergeant.

1095
01:01:08,542 --> 01:01:11,041
The wind's blowin' me
in another direction,

1096
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,333
and it ain't no use
arguin' with the wind.

1097
01:01:13,417 --> 01:01:14,834
- Hey, how about going out
with me tonight

1098
01:01:14,917 --> 01:01:16,291
instead of playin' the field?

1099
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:17,750
Yeah, Carmen,
pick out one.

1100
01:01:17,834 --> 01:01:19,709
That'll release
the rest of 'em.

- What is it?

1148
01:03:41,542 --> 01:03:42,667
- Nothing.
Go ahead.

1149
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:44,000
- Hmm? "Go ahead."

1150
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:47,542
Where could I go in our bed
without you?

1151
01:03:47,625 --> 01:03:48,792
Hmm?

1152
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:54,250
- What's wrong?

1153
01:03:55,709 --> 01:03:57,208
- Nothing.

1154
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:02,000
- The truth.

1155
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:05,500
Don't cry.

1156
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:08,417
- I just never...

1157
01:04:09,542 --> 01:04:13,333
Really much liked sex,
that's all.

1158
01:04:13,417 --> 01:04:15,458
- Should have told me.

1159
01:04:15,542 --> 01:04:18,166
- It's okay.
I don't mind.

1160
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:19,917
- I mind.

1161
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:24,083
If you never liked sex,

1162
01:04:24,166 --> 01:04:26,333
then probably

1163
01:04:26,417 --> 01:04:29,375
you never had sex.

1164
01:04:29,458 --> 01:04:32,125
You're still untouched...

1165
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:34,041
inside.

1166
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:36,291
Deeply inside...

1167
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:38,125
in your heart.

1168
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:44,542
We will discover your heart
and open it together.

1169
01:04:44,625 --> 01:04:47,417
There's no hurry.

1170
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,291
Not at all.

1171
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:59,875
We have all the time
in the world to do this.

1172
01:05:03,625 --> 01:05:05,458
All the time in the world.

1173
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:08,792
- I love you.

1174
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:26,917
So, Dorothy,
listen to me.

1175
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,417
I saw that Tarzan
picture you were in.

1176
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,458
What a stinker.

1177
01:05:31,542 --> 01:05:32,625
But I gotta tell you,

1178
01:05:32,709 --> 01:05:34,166
in the middle
of all those monkeys,

1179
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:37,500
and all that monkey shit,
you were the one thing

1180
01:05:37,583 --> 01:05:39,166
that made my troop salute.

1181
01:05:41,834 --> 01:05:44,250
Is that why you asked
to see me, Mr. Zanuck?

1182
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:48,917
- You know, this is my studio,
and when I see an entertainer

1183
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,583
with such extraordinary assets,

1184
01:05:51,667 --> 01:05:54,500
I want to make sure
that 20th Century Fox

1185
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:56,667
further explores
that entertainer.

1186
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:59,542
- Could we...I thought we were
here to discuss a deal.

1187
01:05:59,625 --> 01:06:02,083
I have seen
the "Carmen" dailies.

1188
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:05,208
And you're on fire.

1189
01:06:08,041 --> 01:06:10,041
And I felt the heat.

1190
01:06:12,625 --> 01:06:13,667
- I hope you don't think

1191
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:15,750
we colored girls
drop our panties

1192
01:06:15,834 --> 01:06:19,250
every time one of you white
boys pays us a compliment.

1193
01:06:19,333 --> 01:06:21,291
Dorothy, I...

1194
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:22,792
I don't think Mr. Zanuck
is say...

1195
01:06:22,875 --> 01:06:24,125
Well, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1196
01:06:24,208 --> 01:06:27,083
That's the trouble
with you people.

1197
01:06:28,458 --> 01:06:30,125
The colored race

1198
01:06:30,208 --> 01:06:32,208
is always focused

1199
01:06:32,291 --> 01:06:33,959
on the treatment
you expect to get

1200
01:06:34,041 --> 01:06:36,291
instead of the treatment
you're getting.

1201
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:39,542
I'm trying to offer you
a three-picture contract here.

1202
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:44,792
- We're listening.

1203
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:47,417
- The public isn't ready
for a colored leading lady.

1204
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,250
- Well...
- Not yet.

1205
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:52,375
But I know she's a star,

1206
01:06:52,458 --> 01:06:54,166
so I got a plan.

1207
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:56,917
We're gonna smooth the way.

1208
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,125
We're gonna let people
get to know you.

1209
01:06:59,208 --> 01:07:01,166
- Won't they already
know her as Carmen?

1210
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:02,667
Carmen's
just the beginning.

1211
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:05,625
I'm gonna do a remake
of "The Blue Angel,"

1212
01:07:05,709 --> 01:07:07,375
with you as a Negro girl.

1213
01:07:07,458 --> 01:07:09,333
Then I'm gonna have you
play an Italian girl

1214
01:07:09,417 --> 01:07:11,166
in a foreign legion picture,

1215
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:13,041
then a Mexican girl.

1216
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:15,417
By this time
two years from now,

1217
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:18,291
the public's gonna love you
so much as the Mexican lead,

1218
01:07:18,375 --> 01:07:20,208
as the Italian lead,
that they'll beg to see you

1219
01:07:20,291 --> 01:07:22,291
in any white role.

1220
01:07:23,709 --> 01:07:26,250
You're gonna be a huge star,
Dorothy.

1221
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:27,875
Just huge.

1222
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:31,041
- So what kind of deal
are we talking about?

1223
01:07:31,125 --> 01:07:33,917
- 30,000,
escalating to 75.

1224
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,375
- 50,000,
escalating to 100.

1225
01:07:36,458 --> 01:07:38,959
- 75,
escalating to 125.

1226
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:42,625
- That's a lot of money.

1227
01:07:44,041 --> 01:07:46,041
- We won't accept a penny less.

1228
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:47,792
- That's not what you said
to Ava Gardner.

1229
01:07:47,875 --> 01:07:49,792
- Well, Ava Gardner's
the number-one box office girl

1230
01:07:49,875 --> 01:07:50,959
in the business.

1231
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:53,542
- Not after "Carmen" comes out,
she isn't.

1232
01:08:00,166 --> 01:08:03,000
Okay. All right.
Here you go.

1233
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:04,792
Come on, come on.

1234
01:08:09,834 --> 01:08:11,250
- Ava Gardner's salary?

1235
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:13,375
- Her manager's percentage?

1236
01:08:14,792 --> 01:08:17,375
- Where did you learn
to horse-trade like that?

1237
01:08:17,458 --> 01:08:19,417
- Otto coached me.

1238
01:08:32,792 --> 01:08:34,917
- The Last Frontier Hotel
is proud to welcome

1239
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,291
Miss Dandridge
as their first Negro guest.

1240
01:08:37,375 --> 01:08:39,750
We look forward
to her performances.

1241
01:08:39,834 --> 01:08:41,917
The chefs are at
her disposal.

1242
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,750
Meals will be delivered
to her room.

1243
01:08:43,834 --> 01:08:45,834
She can have any dish
she likes.

1244
01:08:45,917 --> 01:08:48,250
- You're saying she can't
use the dining room.

1245
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:50,291
- What about
the restrooms backstage?

1246
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:51,500
Can I at least use
the restroom?

1247
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:53,041
- She can, right?
- Well, uh...

1248
01:08:53,125 --> 01:08:54,333
- Oh, now, look,

1249
01:08:54,417 --> 01:08:56,792
I was told Dorothy would be
extended every courtesy.

1250
01:08:56,875 --> 01:08:59,917
- She will be, in her room.
- Oh, here we go.

1251
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,458
- The casino and the restaurant
are obviously off-limits.

1252
01:09:02,542 --> 01:09:04,875
The club too except, of course,
when she is performing,

1253
01:09:04,959 --> 01:09:06,959
and the pool.

1254
01:09:07,041 --> 01:09:08,000
- I can't use the pool?

1255
01:09:08,083 --> 01:09:09,500
- I don't believe this.

1256
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:12,250
- If she got in the pool,
it would have to be drained.

1257
01:09:12,333 --> 01:09:13,542
- Drained?

1258
01:09:13,625 --> 01:09:14,792
- Health reasons.

1259
01:09:14,875 --> 01:09:19,291
Listen, this is Las Vegas.

1260
01:09:19,375 --> 01:09:20,959
Mr. Mills?

1261
01:09:23,041 --> 01:09:24,625
I tell you what, I can take

1262
01:09:24,709 --> 01:09:27,709
one of the smaller bathrooms
backstage,

1263
01:09:27,792 --> 01:09:31,291
mark it, uh, "Coloreds Only."

1264
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:32,834
Now, won't that be nice?

1265
01:09:32,917 --> 01:09:34,542
- Swell.

1266
01:09:34,625 --> 01:09:36,625
- Don't forget your key.

1267
01:09:36,709 --> 01:09:37,834
Have a good stay.

1268
01:09:37,917 --> 01:09:39,083
Jerk.

1269
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,667
Can I get you something?

1270
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:53,709
Coffee?

1271
01:09:53,792 --> 01:09:54,917
Tea?

1272
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Baseball bat?

1273
01:09:57,083 --> 01:09:58,834
- Go ahead, Earl.
Make jokes.

1274
01:09:58,917 --> 01:10:01,750
Tonight I'll take my bows
and exit stage rear,

1275
01:10:01,834 --> 01:10:03,583
go through the kitchen,
past the casino,

1276
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:04,834
around the pool

1277
01:10:04,917 --> 01:10:06,542
that I'm apparently
too dirty to swim in,

1278
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:07,792
up the service elevator,

1279
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,834
into my luxurious
penthouse suite,

1280
01:10:09,917 --> 01:10:11,500
sip my complimentary champagne,

1281
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:14,458
and pee
in a brand-new Dixie cup!

1282
01:10:16,667 --> 01:10:19,000
- I take that walk with you
every night, you know.

1283
01:10:19,083 --> 01:10:22,959
- But the difference is,
Earl, you don't have to.

1284
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:26,625
- That's true.
I don't.

1285
01:10:26,709 --> 01:10:28,542
- I'm in a big picture.

1286
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:30,125
Somehow, I thought this time,

1287
01:10:30,208 --> 01:10:31,875
things would be
a little bit different.

1288
01:10:31,959 --> 01:10:33,041
- I know, I know.

1289
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:34,542
You're right.

1290
01:10:34,625 --> 01:10:36,291
You're right.

1291
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:37,875
But, Dorothy,

1292
01:10:37,959 --> 01:10:40,667
you're the first Negro
to play here.

1293
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:42,875
You're the first, the first.

1294
01:10:42,959 --> 01:10:45,417
You're the first
to stay in this hotel.

1295
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:48,250
You're the highest-paid ever.

1296
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:49,542
Angel face...

1297
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:52,250
you make it possible
for it to be different

1298
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:54,917
next time for somebody else.

1299
01:10:55,041 --> 01:10:57,166
Now, come on.

1300
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:59,000
Hmm?

1301
01:10:59,083 --> 01:11:01,333
I know you got the moxie
to do this.

1302
01:11:01,417 --> 01:11:03,917
- How do you know
what I've got?

1303
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,500
- Because...

1304
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:11,875
Because I love you.

1305
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,166
- Why, Earl Mills.

1306
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:31,083
Well...

1307
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:34,834
- So now what do we do?

1308
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,875
- Whatever you want.

1309
01:11:48,083 --> 01:11:50,542
There's one over there.
- Yes.

1310
01:11:54,625 --> 01:11:55,917
- Excuse me.

1311
01:11:57,583 --> 01:11:59,792
Uh, can I help you?

1312
01:11:59,875 --> 01:12:01,458
- Uh, yes, actually,
you can.

1313
01:12:01,542 --> 01:12:03,375
The mints on my pillow
were stale.

1314
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:04,667
Could you take care of that?

1315
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:06,959
- Perhaps Miss Dandridge
would be more comfortable

1316
01:12:07,041 --> 01:12:08,208
in her room?

1317
01:12:08,291 --> 01:12:10,542
- Miss Dandridge
is quite comfortable, thank you.

1318
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:12,083
- Are you sure?
- Very.

1319
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:15,041
What a lovely pool
you have here.

1320
01:12:15,125 --> 01:12:16,875
- Miss Dandridge, please.

1321
01:12:19,375 --> 01:12:21,875
Oh! Oh, my.

1322
01:12:21,959 --> 01:12:23,166
- Oh, my gosh.

1323
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:24,875
The water's quite cold,

1324
01:12:24,959 --> 01:12:26,667
but lovely nonetheless.

1325
01:12:29,709 --> 01:12:31,000
- I hope you're happy.

1326
01:12:31,083 --> 01:12:32,542
- No.

1327
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:34,625
I'm not happy at all.

1328
01:12:34,709 --> 01:12:37,583
Negroes cannot swim
in this pool!

1329
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,709
- Fantastic,
as usual.

1330
01:13:01,792 --> 01:13:04,125
Thanks.

1331
01:13:05,333 --> 01:13:06,709
- Good night.
- Night.

1332
01:13:06,792 --> 01:13:08,542
Good night.

1333
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,542
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dorothy Dandridge

1334
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:36,000
here at the New York premiere
of "Carmen Jones."

1335
01:13:37,542 --> 01:13:38,709
And here's Robert Wagner...

1336
01:13:38,792 --> 01:13:40,208
- Thank you.

1337
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:41,792
The mayor
of New York City.

1338
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:44,083
You look beautiful.

1339
01:13:44,166 --> 01:13:45,875
- Miss Dandridge.
- Oh.

1340
01:13:45,959 --> 01:13:48,166
- May we have you take
some pictures with Mr. Belafonte

1341
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:49,750
for the press,
if you wouldn't mind?

1342
01:13:49,834 --> 01:13:51,750
Congratulations on the film.

1343
01:13:51,834 --> 01:13:52,917
- Harry.

1344
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,250
- Nice big smile.

1345
01:13:54,333 --> 01:13:56,083
- How wonderful you both look.
Yeah, this is good.

1346
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:58,709
Otto Preminger,
director of "Carmen Jones."

1347
01:13:58,792 --> 01:14:00,250
- Here's Mr. Preminger.

1348
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,208
Mr. Preminger.

1349
01:14:05,291 --> 01:14:07,834
May we get some photos of you,
sir, with your cast?

1350
01:14:09,959 --> 01:14:13,291
And your wife, too,
of course, if she wouldn't mind.

1351
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,959
Pearl Bailey.

1352
01:14:15,041 --> 01:14:17,291
Miss Bailey, would you say
a few words to the press?

1353
01:14:17,375 --> 01:14:19,917
All right,
everyone smile, please.

1354
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,417
Close together, please.
Tighter.

1355
01:14:25,041 --> 01:14:27,083
- How dare you
parade her in front of me?

1356
01:14:29,083 --> 01:14:30,500
- I didn't know
she was coming.

1357
01:14:30,583 --> 01:14:32,500
- It was my night, Otto.

1358
01:14:32,583 --> 01:14:34,583
You won't be seen with me
in public, but then I have to

1359
01:14:34,667 --> 01:14:37,041
watch you traipse around
with her.

1360
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:40,291
- She's my wife.

1361
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:42,417
- Tell her to leave.

1362
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,291
You have an understanding,
remember?

1363
01:14:44,375 --> 01:14:47,041
She openly makes the rounds,
Otto, with another man,

1364
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:48,458
and you don't complain
about it.

1365
01:14:48,542 --> 01:14:51,750
So why couldn't you spend
the evening with me?

1366
01:14:51,834 --> 01:14:53,875
- There's not just you
and me.

1367
01:14:53,959 --> 01:14:55,875
There are others
to take care of,

1368
01:14:55,959 --> 01:14:57,166
there's a movie
to take care of...

1369
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:59,291
- I don't care about the movie.

1370
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:05,667
- You do.

1371
01:15:12,583 --> 01:15:16,333
This is America,
land of opportunity,

1372
01:15:16,417 --> 01:15:18,834
but it's America.

1373
01:15:18,917 --> 01:15:23,166
If it got out
that we were together...

1374
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:25,792
the movie would never open.

1375
01:15:28,166 --> 01:15:31,166
And I want you to be a star.

1376
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:33,250
I want you to have everything.

1377
01:15:33,333 --> 01:15:36,083
What you deserve.

1378
01:15:36,166 --> 01:15:38,500
My...

1379
01:15:38,583 --> 01:15:40,667
our movie...

1380
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:43,083
will change everything.

1381
01:15:44,125 --> 01:15:46,375
- I won't just be a mistress.

1382
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:48,125
Everything.

1383
01:15:57,959 --> 01:16:00,125
We will be together

1384
01:16:00,208 --> 01:16:02,208
when the time is right.

1385
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:04,333
- So we're getting married?

1386
01:16:06,041 --> 01:16:08,375
- When the time is right.

1387
01:16:15,792 --> 01:16:17,750
You were always reminding me

1388
01:16:17,834 --> 01:16:21,625
of my responsibility, Geri.

1389
01:16:21,709 --> 01:16:24,250
You were so aware.

1390
01:16:24,333 --> 01:16:27,208
I thought things
would just fall into place.

1391
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:31,083
If I wanted something
badly enough, it'd just happen.

1392
01:16:35,709 --> 01:16:38,750
- Latest box office reports
through the roof.

1393
01:16:38,834 --> 01:16:40,291
- Mmm, and when that reporter
asked me

1394
01:16:40,375 --> 01:16:41,917
why I thought whites
were flocking

1395
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,166
to see an all-Negro picture,
you know what I said?

1396
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:45,500
What?

1397
01:16:45,583 --> 01:16:47,583
- I guess people just
like to look at me.

1398
01:16:47,667 --> 01:16:49,083
Yeah, you know it.

1399
01:16:49,166 --> 01:16:52,083
I'm getting offers.
From studios.

1400
01:16:52,166 --> 01:16:53,458
With love scenes.

1401
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:55,917
- They've just realized
that colored folk

1402
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,709
have sex like everybody else.

1403
01:16:57,792 --> 01:17:01,083
- What's important is how well
the picture's doing down South.

1404
01:17:01,166 --> 01:17:02,625
It's a big step.
I'm telling you,

1405
01:17:02,709 --> 01:17:04,291
integration
can't be far behind.

1406
01:17:04,375 --> 01:17:06,083
With that,
another bottle of champagne.

1407
01:17:06,166 --> 01:17:07,625
- Hear, hear!
- Waiter.

1408
01:17:07,709 --> 01:17:09,041
- Yes, sir?
- Two more bottles, please.

1409
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:10,750
- No more for you, Vivvy.

1410
01:17:13,667 --> 01:17:14,834
- Viv.

1411
01:17:14,917 --> 01:17:17,000
- Well, I want to know what
you're wearing

1412
01:17:17,083 --> 01:17:18,125
to the Academy Awards.

1413
01:17:18,208 --> 01:17:20,250
- Geri, can't ask me that.

1414
01:17:20,333 --> 01:17:21,875
- Why not?
- It's bad luck.

1415
01:17:21,959 --> 01:17:24,250
- You think you're queen
of the fuckin' world, don't you?

1416
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:26,125
Everybody's talking
about "Carmen,"

1417
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:28,583
the film industry's
colored whore.

1418
01:17:28,667 --> 01:17:29,959
- Lower your voice, Vivvy.

1419
01:17:30,041 --> 01:17:31,458
- You think just because
you become a big film star

1420
01:17:31,542 --> 01:17:33,709
by shaking your tail
that people aren't

1421
01:17:33,792 --> 01:17:35,375
gonna treat you
like you're colored?

1422
01:17:35,458 --> 01:17:36,792
- Vivvy, why don't you
let me take you home?

1423
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:39,709
- No.
Well, I'm somethin', too.

1424
01:17:39,792 --> 01:17:41,959
I'm somethin', too!

1425
01:17:42,041 --> 01:17:45,959
I'm more than
Dorothy Dandridge's big sister!

1426
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:47,250
- Shh, shh, shh.

1427
01:17:49,208 --> 01:17:50,166
- You ever notice that?

1428
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:52,375
Do you ever notice that,
any of you?

1429
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:54,000
- Why don't you go home
with Earl?

1430
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:55,667
- I don't wanna go!
- Come on, come on.

1431
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:58,333
- I don't wanna go.
- Get in the car and go, Vivvy!

1432
01:17:58,417 --> 01:17:59,917
- No!
- Let's go. Come on.

1433
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,083
Shh, shh.

1434
01:18:01,166 --> 01:18:02,333
Vivvy, Vivvy.

1435
01:18:02,417 --> 01:18:05,250
- You're not gonna win
an Oscar, Dottie.

1436
01:18:05,333 --> 01:18:06,667
They already gave us one.

1437
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:08,667
- All right, let's go, Vivvy.

1438
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:09,834
Let's go.

1439
01:18:09,917 --> 01:18:12,917
No!

1440
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:17,166
- Go.
- No! No.

1441
01:18:18,917 --> 01:18:21,667
- You want her to play...Tuptim?

1442
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:23,125
Who is Tuptim?

1443
01:18:23,208 --> 01:18:24,625
That's not the lead role.

1444
01:18:24,709 --> 01:18:26,166
- Dorothy, look,

1445
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:28,417
listen to me.

1446
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:32,750
Sometimes you do a picture
just because it's big.

1447
01:18:32,834 --> 01:18:34,875
"The King and I"
is going to be huge.

1448
01:18:34,959 --> 01:18:37,625
It'll be seen by millions
and millions of people,

1449
01:18:37,709 --> 01:18:39,709
far more than ever saw "Carmen,"

1450
01:18:39,792 --> 01:18:43,709
and I'm telling you,
Tuptim is a good role.

1451
01:18:43,792 --> 01:18:46,166
- She'll be paid
her regular salary?

1452
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:47,875
- Of course.
- And it fulfills

1453
01:18:47,959 --> 01:18:50,166
one of the three pictures
she's committed to doing here?

1454
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:52,125
- Yes, Earl, absolutely.

1455
01:18:54,458 --> 01:18:56,625
- I...we have to think
about this.

1456
01:18:56,709 --> 01:18:58,667
I'll let you...
- I'll do it.

1457
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,125
- Dorothy.
- I'll do it.

1458
01:19:00,208 --> 01:19:02,291
- She says she'll do it.

1459
01:19:04,917 --> 01:19:06,959
- Actually, I think a toast
is called for,

1460
01:19:07,041 --> 01:19:08,291
ladies and gentlemen.

1461
01:19:08,375 --> 01:19:09,875
Toast...
- Toast.

1462
01:19:09,959 --> 01:19:11,959
- To the first colored woman

1463
01:19:12,041 --> 01:19:15,667
ever nominated for an Oscar
as Best Actress.

1464
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:16,750
To Dorothy.

1465
01:19:16,834 --> 01:19:17,917
- Hear, hear.

1466
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,709
- Yeah.
- Oh, baby.

1467
01:19:19,792 --> 01:19:21,250
- Mama. Thank you.

1468
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:23,709
- Congratulations. Yeah.
- Thank you.

1469
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:25,792
- Congratulations to you.

1470
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:27,000
- Thank you.

1471
01:19:30,875 --> 01:19:32,291
For the last three days,

1472
01:19:32,375 --> 01:19:35,125
I haven't been able to eat
waiting for these nominations

1473
01:19:35,208 --> 01:19:36,417
to come out.

1474
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:39,083
And, Mama, you know
I'm tellin' the truth.

1475
01:19:39,166 --> 01:19:41,917
But now, who wants
some chitlins?

1476
01:19:43,709 --> 01:19:45,792
- Oh, she's beautiful,
isn't she?

1477
01:19:50,709 --> 01:19:53,917
Oh, I have no idea
what I'm going to wear.

1478
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,917
- I don't think
you should do

1479
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,375
the Tuptim part after all.

1480
01:19:58,458 --> 01:20:01,458
- But I already said I would.

1481
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:07,041
- That was before you were

1482
01:20:07,125 --> 01:20:09,125
an Academy Award-nominated
actress.

1483
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:13,792
- Well, but I'm not exactly
being offered anything else.

1484
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:19,542
- You sing...nightclubs

1485
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:23,375
until a real role comes along.

1486
01:20:25,917 --> 01:20:29,000
And I will make
a movie soon.

1487
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:31,125
- Zanuck said that Tuptim
was a good part.

1488
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:32,959
- Mm-hmm.
- And he really thinks

1489
01:20:33,041 --> 01:20:34,250
it's something I should do.

1490
01:20:34,333 --> 01:20:37,291
- None of the other nominees
have to play slaves.

1491
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:39,917
- Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

1492
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,625
She's already agreed
to play the part.

1493
01:20:50,166 --> 01:20:51,500
- I've changed my mind.

1494
01:20:51,583 --> 01:20:54,959
I don't think I should
have to play a slave.

1495
01:20:55,041 --> 01:20:57,583
- You can't change your mind.

1496
01:20:57,667 --> 01:20:58,917
You shook hands with Zanuck.

1497
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,291
- You don't see Audrey Hepburn
playin' a slave.

1498
01:21:01,375 --> 01:21:03,917
- Well, you're not
Audrey Hepburn.

1499
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,375
- No. Hmm!

1500
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:06,750
She's Dorothy Dandridge.

1501
01:21:06,834 --> 01:21:08,500
- Oh, excuse me, Otto,
but Zanuck's not going

1502
01:21:08,583 --> 01:21:10,166
to stand for this,
and you know it.

1503
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:12,041
She'll be dead at Fox,
she'll be dead

1504
01:21:12,125 --> 01:21:13,500
at every other studio
in town.

1505
01:21:13,583 --> 01:21:16,083
Dorothy...
- I will not play Tuptim.

1506
01:21:16,166 --> 01:21:19,041
Who is this talking?

1507
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:20,500
Is this you?

1508
01:21:20,583 --> 01:21:22,000
Is this you or is this Otto?

1509
01:21:22,083 --> 01:21:24,542
- I make my own decisions.

1510
01:21:24,625 --> 01:21:27,542
- Dorothy, please,
please, listen to me.

1511
01:21:27,625 --> 01:21:28,917
Don't do this.

1512
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,834
If you do
what Otto wants...

1513
01:21:31,917 --> 01:21:34,000
I won't be able to protect you
this time...

1514
01:21:34,083 --> 01:21:36,166
- And when exactly
did you protect me?

1515
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:37,375
When I was peein' in the cup

1516
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:39,667
or when they were
drainin' the pool?

1517
01:21:43,333 --> 01:21:44,458
- All right.

1518
01:21:46,625 --> 01:21:47,709
All right.

1519
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:50,750
Well...

1520
01:21:50,834 --> 01:21:52,792
congratulations again...

1521
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:56,000
To both of you.

1522
01:21:58,959 --> 01:22:01,667
Earl? Earl,
where are you going?

1523
01:22:05,041 --> 01:22:07,417
- It'll be better without him.

1524
01:22:16,583 --> 01:22:18,792
Is here tonight
in New York City...

1525
01:22:18,875 --> 01:22:20,250
Dorothy Dandridge,

1526
01:22:20,333 --> 01:22:22,917
nominated for Best Actress
in "Carmen Jones."

1527
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,166
The other nominees
are Judy Garland,

1528
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:27,583
Audrey Hepburn,
Grace Kelly,

1529
01:22:27,667 --> 01:22:28,917
and Jane Wyatt.

1530
01:22:40,041 --> 01:22:42,083
- Thank you, Bob.

1531
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,291
If I seem a little nervous...

1532
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:53,291
this is as big a moment for me

1533
01:22:53,375 --> 01:22:57,583
as it will be
for the winner of this award.

1534
01:22:57,667 --> 01:22:59,709
For Film Editing...

1535
01:23:03,625 --> 01:23:04,625
In Hollywood,

1536
01:23:04,709 --> 01:23:07,959
"On the Waterfront,"
Gene Milford.

1537
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,166
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

1538
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:16,834
here's the Academy Award

1539
01:23:16,917 --> 01:23:19,375
for Best Actress of the Year.

1540
01:23:21,333 --> 01:23:22,667
- Well, time is running short
again,

1541
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:24,417
so the award for
the Best Performance

1542
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,709
by an Actress...

1543
01:23:27,917 --> 01:23:29,291
Grace Kelly
for "The Country Girl."

1544
01:23:43,917 --> 01:23:46,250
- I knew they wouldn't
give it to one of us.

1545
01:23:51,417 --> 01:23:53,125
I did win

1546
01:23:53,208 --> 01:23:55,250
because I won in my heart.

1547
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:57,542
Vivvy never did understand
that.

1548
01:23:59,166 --> 01:24:00,834
Did I tell you Mama
finally found out

1549
01:24:00,917 --> 01:24:03,333
that she moved to Canada?

1550
01:24:03,417 --> 01:24:06,333
Says she's got a little boy

1551
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:10,375
and that she's happy.

1552
01:24:10,458 --> 01:24:12,291
I hope so.

1553
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:18,375
You never realize

1554
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:21,875
the last time
you see somebody...

1555
01:24:21,959 --> 01:24:23,959
that it is the last time.

1556
01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:30,250
Few minutes,
Miss Dandridge.

1557
01:24:30,333 --> 01:24:32,208
- Thank you.

1558
01:24:38,417 --> 01:24:39,834
Otto.

1559
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:45,375
You made it.

1560
01:24:45,458 --> 01:24:48,917
So, what do you think
of your choice?

1561
01:24:49,041 --> 01:24:50,667
Hmm?
- Ah...

1562
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:52,083
It's a wonderful dress.

1563
01:24:52,166 --> 01:24:53,959
Make a good team.

1564
01:24:54,041 --> 01:24:56,500
- After we're married,
we'll make an even better team.

1565
01:24:56,583 --> 01:24:57,750
- Be patient.

1566
01:24:59,667 --> 01:25:03,041
You said...

1567
01:25:03,125 --> 01:25:04,667
when the time was right.

1568
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:08,000
Well, the time is now right.
It's 1957.

1569
01:25:08,083 --> 01:25:10,166
The world is changing.

1570
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:13,834
If not here, Europe.
We could work in Europe.

1571
01:25:15,917 --> 01:25:17,208
- Europe.

1572
01:25:21,417 --> 01:25:24,083
- You do love me, don't you?

1573
01:25:27,417 --> 01:25:29,834
- I will always love you.

1574
01:25:32,208 --> 01:25:34,750
- I want a honeymoon in Paris.

1575
01:25:34,834 --> 01:25:36,166
I'll get fat

1576
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:37,291
and have lots of babies.

1577
01:25:37,375 --> 01:25:39,917
Boys, a house full of boys.

1578
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,792
- Boys and girls.

1579
01:25:41,875 --> 01:25:43,583
- Okay.

1580
01:25:44,917 --> 01:25:46,208
- Beautiful dream.

1581
01:25:47,417 --> 01:25:49,583
- It's not a dream.

1582
01:25:53,166 --> 01:25:54,792
One minute,
Miss Dandridge.

1583
01:25:54,875 --> 01:25:57,917
- You have to go onstage,
and I have to get to my seat.

1584
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,250
- The best seat in the house,
table 15.

1585
01:26:05,542 --> 01:26:08,333
What?

1586
01:26:08,417 --> 01:26:09,375
- It's German.

1587
01:26:09,458 --> 01:26:11,333
Uh, break your leg.

1588
01:26:32,917 --> 01:26:34,458
Ladies and gentlemen,

1589
01:26:34,542 --> 01:26:37,000
the Mocambo welcomes back
the delicious,

1590
01:26:37,083 --> 01:26:38,834
the divine, the delightful

1591
01:26:38,917 --> 01:26:40,166
Dorothy Dandridge.

1592
01:26:51,083 --> 01:26:53,709
- ♪ You do ♪

1593
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:56,792
♪ Something to me ♪

Who is it?

1631
01:30:03,625 --> 01:30:04,667
- Jack Denison.

1632
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:07,041
I'm the manager here
at the Riviera.

1633
01:30:07,125 --> 01:30:08,291
- Yes?

1634
01:30:10,208 --> 01:30:12,041
- I wanted to tell you
what a thrill it is

1635
01:30:12,125 --> 01:30:13,875
having you here with us.

1636
01:30:13,959 --> 01:30:15,333
- Thank you.

1637
01:30:15,417 --> 01:30:17,375
Um, if you don't mind,
Mr. Denison,

1638
01:30:17,458 --> 01:30:19,792
I'm a bit tired, so, uh...

1639
01:30:19,875 --> 01:30:22,834
- Oh, no. I just came by
to bring you these.

1640
01:30:23,875 --> 01:30:25,250
Daisies.

1641
01:30:25,333 --> 01:30:26,875
- Compliments of the hotel.

1642
01:30:26,959 --> 01:30:28,583
I hope they're all right.

1643
01:30:28,667 --> 01:30:30,750
- Yes, they're...they're lovely.
Thank you.

1644
01:30:30,834 --> 01:30:34,500
Just an unusual choice,
that's all.

1645
01:30:34,583 --> 01:30:38,250
Someone very special
to me loved daisies.

1646
01:30:38,333 --> 01:30:39,583
She died.

1647
01:30:39,667 --> 01:30:41,375
Childbirth.

1648
01:30:42,542 --> 01:30:43,792
- Childbirth?

1649
01:30:43,875 --> 01:30:45,417
She was a lovely woman.

1650
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:48,083
We were to be married.

1651
01:30:49,709 --> 01:30:52,500
She went into labor early.
We were on vacation,

1652
01:30:52,583 --> 01:30:55,083
and no white hospital
in the area would take her.

1653
01:30:55,166 --> 01:30:58,083
- She was a colored girl?

1654
01:30:58,166 --> 01:31:01,250
- Try to put flowers
on her grave every week

1655
01:31:01,333 --> 01:31:03,667
and on our child's.

1656
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:05,792
- That's lovely.

1657
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:07,041
Um...

1658
01:31:08,709 --> 01:31:11,208
Have...have a seat.
Stay if you want.

1659
01:31:11,291 --> 01:31:12,458
Go on.

1660
01:31:13,875 --> 01:31:14,792
- Please,

1661
01:31:14,875 --> 01:31:17,375
let me do that for you.

1662
01:31:25,542 --> 01:31:26,625
- Thank you.

1663
01:31:27,875 --> 01:31:29,291
Dottie Mae,
I'm tellin' you,

1664
01:31:29,375 --> 01:31:30,959
don't marry that man.

1665
01:31:31,041 --> 01:31:32,291
He ain't no good.

1666
01:31:32,375 --> 01:31:34,792
I can feel it all in my bones.

1667
01:31:34,875 --> 01:31:37,291
- I'll tell you one thing
Auntie was right about.

1668
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:40,625
A man and 5 cents'll pay
a colored girl's fare

1669
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:43,709
all the way to nowhere.

1670
01:31:52,583 --> 01:31:55,000
- Miss Dandridge,
I've been looking for you.

1671
01:31:55,083 --> 01:31:56,834
They brought in a new director.

1672
01:31:56,917 --> 01:31:59,667
- Who is it?
- Miss Dandridge!

1673
01:32:07,333 --> 01:32:09,208
Mr. Poitier and I have been
ready to shoot

1674
01:32:09,291 --> 01:32:10,542
for some minutes now.

1675
01:32:10,625 --> 01:32:12,417
- I've only just
arrived myself.

1676
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:15,083
- I have seen the rushes.

1677
01:32:15,166 --> 01:32:17,542
Your performance
is not credible,

1678
01:32:17,625 --> 01:32:19,000
almost ridiculous.

1679
01:32:19,083 --> 01:32:20,583
- I don't think
that was necessary.

1680
01:32:20,667 --> 01:32:24,333
- Would you care to direct
the picture, Mr. Poitier?

1681
01:32:24,417 --> 01:32:25,750
Would you?

1682
01:32:30,792 --> 01:32:32,375
So,

1683
01:32:32,458 --> 01:32:34,583
in the scene,

1684
01:32:34,667 --> 01:32:37,041
you have just been raped,
right?

1685
01:32:37,125 --> 01:32:40,417
You are supposed
to be upset, broken.

1686
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:43,625
Instead, you have been
prancing around

1687
01:32:43,709 --> 01:32:46,375
like a queen
on her throne,

1688
01:32:46,458 --> 01:32:47,792
using glycerin tears

1689
01:32:47,875 --> 01:32:49,750
because you are too lazy
to make yourself cry.

1690
01:32:49,834 --> 01:32:52,417
- I'm not lazy.
- You are pathetic!

1691
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:53,959
What happened to you?

1692
01:32:54,917 --> 01:32:56,959
You used to be
a beautiful thing.

1693
01:32:57,041 --> 01:32:58,709
Now you're nothing,
and if you're going

1694
01:32:58,792 --> 01:33:02,417
to mess up my picture,
you little sniveling brat,

1695
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:06,125
then I will make sure
that you will never work again.

1696
01:33:06,208 --> 01:33:07,291
Good.

1697
01:33:07,375 --> 01:33:09,166
Places, everybody!

1698
01:33:10,834 --> 01:33:12,750
Move!

1699
01:33:19,834 --> 01:33:22,458
- Real tears, finally.

1700
01:33:22,542 --> 01:33:24,208
Page?

1701
01:33:24,291 --> 01:33:25,709
Roll 'em.

1702
01:33:25,792 --> 01:33:27,041
Roll 'em.

1703
01:33:27,125 --> 01:33:28,667
- Speed.
- Rolling.

1704
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:35,250
- Do you think he ever
really loved me?

1705
01:33:35,333 --> 01:33:36,917
Hmm?

1706
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,125
Dorothy,

1707
01:33:38,208 --> 01:33:41,291
you're not even over Otto.

1708
01:33:41,375 --> 01:33:42,542
Now, I'm your friend

1709
01:33:42,625 --> 01:33:44,166
and I'm telling you,
now is the time

1710
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:46,875
to concentrate
on your career,

1711
01:33:46,959 --> 01:33:49,375
not on another white man.

1712
01:34:04,208 --> 01:34:05,583
- Jack?

1713
01:34:08,083 --> 01:34:09,917
- He had a child,

1714
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,375
but she died with the mother

1715
01:34:11,458 --> 01:34:14,375
after he left them
in a motel to starve.

1716
01:34:14,458 --> 01:34:15,792
He's a con man.

1717
01:34:15,875 --> 01:34:18,750
I hired a private investigator,
and he told me.

1718
01:34:18,834 --> 01:34:21,583
Denison isn't worth the dirt
under your feet.

1719
01:34:21,667 --> 01:34:24,667
- Sometimes you stand
on the edge of a cliff

1720
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:26,291
and you jump.

1721
01:34:26,375 --> 01:34:29,792
You jump because
you're tired of being scared.

1722
01:34:29,875 --> 01:34:32,625
Sometimes you jump

1723
01:34:32,709 --> 01:34:35,458
just to see what
it feels like to fall.

1724
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:50,291
Jack?

1725
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:53,333
Hi, honey.

1726
01:34:54,834 --> 01:34:56,542
It's 4:00.
Do you think maybe

1727
01:34:56,625 --> 01:34:58,792
you should get yourself dressed?

1728
01:34:58,875 --> 01:35:00,250
- I am dressed.

1729
01:35:00,333 --> 01:35:03,250
Dressed for the work I do,
which is nothin'.

1730
01:35:03,333 --> 01:35:05,542
When I get my club back,
I'll get dressed, all right?

1731
01:35:05,625 --> 01:35:07,500
- Okay, fine.

1732
01:35:07,583 --> 01:35:09,709
Not tryin' to start
a fight here, honey.

1733
01:35:09,792 --> 01:35:11,667
Can I get you
somethin' else to drink?

1734
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:14,000
- You said get dressed.
What am I gonna get dressed for?

1735
01:35:14,083 --> 01:35:15,542
- Your day, your night.

1736
01:35:15,625 --> 01:35:17,709
Whatever.

1737
01:35:17,792 --> 01:35:19,458
- What did you mean by that?

1738
01:35:19,542 --> 01:35:20,709
Do you think I lost my club

1739
01:35:20,792 --> 01:35:22,125
sittin' around all day
in my robe?

1740
01:35:22,208 --> 01:35:23,500
- No, honey.

1741
01:35:23,583 --> 01:35:25,417
You want to stay in your robe,
then stay in your robe.

1742
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:27,208
- I lost my club
listenin' to you sing

1743
01:35:27,291 --> 01:35:28,709
in front of
an empty house.

1744
01:35:28,792 --> 01:35:30,709
You're supposed to know
people in this town,

1745
01:35:30,792 --> 01:35:32,250
but you don't know nobody.

1746
01:35:32,333 --> 01:35:34,083
- I lost most of my income
singin' there, remember?

1747
01:35:34,166 --> 01:35:36,208
You never paid me a dime...
- Are you saying that singin'

1748
01:35:36,291 --> 01:35:38,000
in the club hurt your career?
- For any one of those dates.

1749
01:35:38,083 --> 01:35:39,417
- Is that what you're saying,
that I hurt you?

1750
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:40,750
- No!
- What are you saying?

1751
01:35:40,834 --> 01:35:42,208
- I'm saying you need
to calm down, honey.

1752
01:35:42,291 --> 01:35:43,792
- Remember...
- I can't remember anything

1753
01:35:43,875 --> 01:35:45,750
with you bitching at me
all night about my robe!

1754
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:50,709
No, Jack, no!

1755
01:35:50,792 --> 01:35:52,125
No, Jack, don't!
No!

1756
01:35:52,208 --> 01:35:54,041
No, Jack.

1757
01:35:54,125 --> 01:35:56,041
Don't, Jack!
Don't do it...

1758
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:57,750
Ah! Oh!

1759
01:35:57,834 --> 01:35:58,792
Jack! No!

1760
01:35:58,875 --> 01:36:00,792
No!
Jack, no!

1761
01:36:00,875 --> 01:36:02,583
- Miss Dandridge,
when did you find out

1762
01:36:02,667 --> 01:36:04,417
you owed over $127,000?

1763
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:06,375
Were you responsible
for the bank loans,

1764
01:36:06,458 --> 01:36:07,583
credit debts,
and bad investments,

1765
01:36:07,667 --> 01:36:09,083
or was that your ex-husband?

1766
01:36:09,166 --> 01:36:10,834
- You declared bankruptcy,
but what about the back taxes?

1767
01:36:10,917 --> 01:36:12,250
- She's not answering
any questions.

1768
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:14,709
- Is it true Mr. Denison
pawned all your jewelry?

1769
01:36:14,792 --> 01:36:16,000
- Dorothy, give us a statement.

1770
01:36:17,291 --> 01:36:18,709
- Miss Dandridge,
you have stated

1771
01:36:18,792 --> 01:36:21,291
your child is a danger
to herself and others,

1772
01:36:21,375 --> 01:36:22,750
that you are unwilling
to care for her,

1773
01:36:22,834 --> 01:36:25,792
and that you will
relinquish parental rights?

1774
01:36:25,875 --> 01:36:28,417
- Well,
I hired a caretaker,

1775
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:30,083
but I haven't been able
to make the payments

1776
01:36:30,166 --> 01:36:32,125
because
I haven't had any...

1777
01:36:32,208 --> 01:36:33,625
- Yes, we've all
heard the testimony.

1778
01:36:33,709 --> 01:36:36,917
Are you willing to relinquish
parental rights?

1779
01:36:41,709 --> 01:36:43,333
- Yes.

1780
01:36:43,417 --> 01:36:44,959
Very well.
Harolyn Nicholas

1781
01:36:45,041 --> 01:36:47,709
shall henceforth become
a ward of the court.

1782
01:36:47,792 --> 01:36:49,709
Care will be provided
by the state institution

1783
01:36:49,792 --> 01:36:51,625
in Camarillo, California.

1784
01:36:53,041 --> 01:36:55,959
- The Mocambo is proud
to welcome back a woman

1785
01:36:56,041 --> 01:36:59,166
who has graced
our stage many times.

1786
01:36:59,250 --> 01:37:00,291
Her star first rose here

1787
01:37:00,375 --> 01:37:02,792
a little over ten years ago
in '51,

1788
01:37:02,875 --> 01:37:06,875
and her star hasn't stopped
streaking our skies with light

1789
01:37:06,959 --> 01:37:08,250
ever since.

1790
01:37:08,333 --> 01:37:10,041

The nation suffered
a loss today,

1801
01:38:08,792 --> 01:38:11,375
as an apparent overdose
of sleeping pills and alcohol

1802
01:38:11,458 --> 01:38:14,959
claimed the life of a treasured
singer and actress,

1803
01:38:15,041 --> 01:38:16,000
Marilyn Monroe.

1804
01:38:16,083 --> 01:38:17,834
- In Switzerland.

1805
01:38:17,917 --> 01:38:20,333
Mm-hmm. They'll teach her
to speak French there.

1806
01:38:22,625 --> 01:38:24,250
I have to go.

1807
01:38:24,333 --> 01:38:26,917
Somebody at my door, okay?

1808
01:38:50,834 --> 01:38:53,250
Hmm.

1809
01:38:53,333 --> 01:38:55,709
Why, Earl Mills.

1810
01:38:59,375 --> 01:39:01,250
- I heard, uh,

1811
01:39:01,333 --> 01:39:05,000
Queen Melmendi was looking
for a way through the jungle.

1812
01:39:05,083 --> 01:39:07,417
- Oh...

1813
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:10,500
Geri worries
too much about me.

1814
01:39:12,625 --> 01:39:14,834
- Well, she's not
the only one.

1815
01:39:19,333 --> 01:39:20,834
Nice place.

1816
01:39:24,834 --> 01:39:26,000
- What do you want?

1817
01:39:26,083 --> 01:39:28,542
- I want to know
how you're doing.

1818
01:39:30,041 --> 01:39:32,333
- I'm fine.

1819
01:39:32,417 --> 01:39:33,959
- I can see that.

1820
01:39:34,041 --> 01:39:36,500
I heard about your show
in Puerto Rico.

1821
01:39:36,583 --> 01:39:38,291
- Which one?

1822
01:39:38,375 --> 01:39:39,625
- Well, you know,
the one where

1823
01:39:39,709 --> 01:39:41,333
you were slurring
your words onstage.

1824
01:39:41,417 --> 01:39:43,375
- Oh.
- Or was that every show?

1825
01:39:43,458 --> 01:39:44,917
- Earl,

1826
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,500
if you came here
to start trouble,

1827
01:39:46,583 --> 01:39:47,959
you might as well
just keep on going.

1828
01:39:48,041 --> 01:39:49,333
- You shouldn't mix
booze with pills.

1829
01:39:49,417 --> 01:39:51,083
Didn't your doctor
tell you that?

1830
01:39:51,166 --> 01:39:52,667
- You don't manage my act.
- No, your act is all your own.

1831
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:54,083
- And you don't manage
my life!

1832
01:39:54,166 --> 01:39:56,375
Why don't you get
out of here?

1833
01:39:56,458 --> 01:39:58,166
I'm busy.

1834
01:39:58,250 --> 01:39:59,875
I got things to do.

1835
01:40:04,083 --> 01:40:06,875
- What do you have to do,
Dorothy,

1836
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,583
write more suicide notes?

1837
01:40:10,667 --> 01:40:12,250
Geri found this.

1838
01:40:25,792 --> 01:40:30,000
I wrote this because I don't
want anybody to see me.

1839
01:40:30,083 --> 01:40:34,125
I don't want 'em to see me
like this, Earl.

1840
01:40:34,208 --> 01:40:37,208
If I go,
cremate me right away.

1841
01:40:37,291 --> 01:40:38,917
Don't let anybody
look at me.

1842
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,417
Don't let 'em just stare at me,
remember me like this.

1843
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:42,834
- Okay, okay,
I promise.

1844
01:40:42,917 --> 01:40:46,291
- I don't want anybody
to look at me.

1845
01:40:46,375 --> 01:40:48,834
My hands are shaking.

1846
01:40:48,917 --> 01:40:51,709
- All right, all right.
Let me hold them.

1847
01:40:51,792 --> 01:40:53,458
- I'm so glad
you're here.

1848
01:40:53,542 --> 01:40:55,375
- Yeah, me, too.
- I'm so ugly.

1849
01:40:55,458 --> 01:40:56,667
- No, you're not.
You're beautiful.

1850
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:58,333
- I need my pills.
- No, you don't.

1851
01:40:58,417 --> 01:40:59,875
- My pills are right over there.
If I could just get my...

1852
01:40:59,959 --> 01:41:02,333
- I'll keep you from shaking.
- If I get my pills...

1853
01:41:02,417 --> 01:41:04,000
- Come on, come on.

1854
01:41:04,083 --> 01:41:06,375
You all right?

1855
01:41:06,458 --> 01:41:07,500
Hmm?

1856
01:41:10,417 --> 01:41:11,875
- You got so old.

1857
01:41:11,959 --> 01:41:15,834
When did you get so old?

1858
01:41:15,917 --> 01:41:17,542
- This morning.

1859
01:41:22,291 --> 01:41:25,542
- Well, I would sing for you,
but I think my syncopation

1860
01:41:25,625 --> 01:41:27,875
might be a little off.

Look at you.

1871
01:42:38,583 --> 01:42:40,375
What, you go for a run?

1872
01:42:40,458 --> 01:42:42,250
- About ten yards up
at the front desk

1873
01:42:42,333 --> 01:42:44,041
to pick up this telegram,

1874
01:42:44,125 --> 01:42:46,750
confirming a run
at the Mocambo,

1875
01:42:46,834 --> 01:42:48,083
two movies in Mexico,

1876
01:42:48,166 --> 01:42:50,583
and a booking at Basin
Street East in New York.

1877
01:42:50,667 --> 01:42:52,834
- Oh!

1878
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:54,250
Oh!

1879
01:42:54,333 --> 01:42:55,667
You know the first thing
I'm gonna do?

1880
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:57,709
- Hmm?
- I'm gonna hire a lawyer.

1881
01:42:57,792 --> 01:43:00,542
I'm gettin' my baby back.
That's the first thing.

1882
01:43:00,625 --> 01:43:02,083
You want to celebrate?
- Hmm.

1883
01:43:02,166 --> 01:43:03,750
- Let's get all dressed up
tonight,

1884
01:43:03,834 --> 01:43:05,166
and you can take me dancing.

1885
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:06,500
- Hmm, can I?
Thank you.

1886
01:43:06,583 --> 01:43:08,458
- Well, just this once.

1887
01:43:08,542 --> 01:43:10,500
- Uh, well, actually,
I can't dance.

1888
01:43:10,583 --> 01:43:12,458
- That's okay, honey,
'cause tonight

1889
01:43:12,542 --> 01:43:14,917
I'll dance enough
for both of us.

1890
01:43:16,291 --> 01:43:18,417
Hmm.

1891
01:43:21,542 --> 01:43:23,417
It's Tofranil.
My doctor prescribed it

1892
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:25,166
for my depression,
remember?

1893
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:26,542
You want to see the bottle?

1894
01:43:26,625 --> 01:43:29,458
- No.
I know you're better.

1895
01:43:31,166 --> 01:43:33,125
- I am better.

1896
01:43:34,709 --> 01:43:36,041
Now, let me go put on
something festive...

1897
01:43:36,125 --> 01:43:37,834
Oh! Oh!

1898
01:43:37,917 --> 01:43:39,792
- What'd you do?
- Oh!

1899
01:43:39,875 --> 01:43:41,500
Oh, Earl!
- All right.

1900
01:43:41,583 --> 01:43:43,083
Don't move, don't move.
- Okay.

1901
01:43:43,166 --> 01:43:45,792
I think I broke it.
- Shh, don't move, don't move.

1902
01:43:47,166 --> 01:43:49,208
Mm-hmm.

1903
01:43:52,709 --> 01:43:56,875
Well, the sun's
comin' up now, so...

1904
01:43:58,375 --> 01:44:00,375
No, I can't.

1905
01:44:00,458 --> 01:44:02,083
I'm leaving for New York
with Earl today.

1906
01:44:02,166 --> 01:44:05,917
You know I got my shows to do,
remember?

1907
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,792
Well, if the cast doesn't
bother them,

1908
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:11,375
it certainly doesn't bother me.

1909
01:44:11,458 --> 01:44:14,125
I think you should get
to bed now.

1910
01:44:15,875 --> 01:44:17,583
Geri,

1911
01:44:17,667 --> 01:44:19,458
I love you.

1912
01:44:19,542 --> 01:44:21,417
Thank you for everything.

1913
01:44:22,834 --> 01:44:24,250
Okay.

1914
01:45:00,542 --> 01:45:02,834
Hello?

1915
01:45:02,917 --> 01:45:06,125
Why, Earl Mills.

1916
01:45:06,208 --> 01:45:08,333
I was just thinkin' about you.

1917
01:45:08,417 --> 01:45:10,750
No, really, I was.

1918
01:45:10,834 --> 01:45:12,625
What time are you
gonna pick me up?

1919
01:45:12,709 --> 01:45:14,166
Ooh, can we make it later?

1920
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:18,125
How about 10:00?
A girl has to pack, you know.

1921
01:45:21,083 --> 01:45:22,625
Okay.

1922
01:45:22,709 --> 01:45:24,458
I'll see you then.

1923
01:46:36,792 --> 01:46:37,834
Dorothy?

1924
01:46:46,041 --> 01:46:47,125
Dorothy!

1925
01:46:50,417 --> 01:46:51,500
Dorothy?

1926
01:47:04,709 --> 01:47:07,792
Angel face?

1927
01:47:07,875 --> 01:47:09,250
Angel face.

1928
01:47:12,583 --> 01:47:15,250
Angel face?

1929
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,750
You know this could have
been the fractured ankle?

1930
01:47:24,834 --> 01:47:26,917
Flakes of bone marrow
get into the bloodstream,

1931
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,125
cause an embolism.

1932
01:47:28,208 --> 01:47:29,750
- How many times
do I have to tell you,

1933
01:47:29,834 --> 01:47:31,959
the easy answer is
usually the right answer?

1934
01:47:32,041 --> 01:47:35,000
There's a bottle of Tofranil
on the dressing table.

1935
01:47:35,083 --> 01:47:37,417
More than likely,
she just overdosed.

1936
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:38,917
- Excuse me.

1937
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,500
Excuse me!

1938
01:47:42,083 --> 01:47:45,291
Could you please ask
these officers to leave

1939
01:47:45,375 --> 01:47:47,083
or cover her up?

1940
01:47:47,166 --> 01:47:49,917
She wouldn't want
people staring at her.

1941
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,834
Guys, wait outside.

1942
01:47:51,917 --> 01:47:53,959
- Come on.
- All right.

1943
01:47:54,041 --> 01:47:55,542
- I don't see any evidence...
- No, no, no.

1944
01:47:55,625 --> 01:47:59,333
- Here at all.
- We have a suicide note.

1945
01:47:59,417 --> 01:48:01,250
- No, no, no, no, no.

1946
01:48:01,333 --> 01:48:03,000
She wrote that note
months ago.

1947
01:48:03,083 --> 01:48:05,875
- Suicide notes don't
exactly expire, you know.

1948
01:48:05,959 --> 01:48:07,291
- Oh, wait a minute.

1949
01:48:07,375 --> 01:48:09,291
She didn't kill herself.
We were going to New York.

1950
01:48:09,375 --> 01:48:10,750
- Mr. Mills, could you wait

1951
01:48:10,834 --> 01:48:12,458
in the other room, please?
- We were going to New York.

1952
01:48:12,542 --> 01:48:14,000
She didn't kill herself!
- Mr. Mills, please.

1953
01:48:14,083 --> 01:48:15,875
- She didn't kill herself.
- Mr. Mills, please.

1954
01:48:15,959 --> 01:48:17,250
- I'll be damned, Richard.

1955
01:48:17,333 --> 01:48:21,125
Wasn't she some kind
of colored singer?

1956
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:02,083
Hollywood
mourns the passing

1957
01:50:02,166 --> 01:50:03,542
of Dorothy Dandridge.

1958
01:50:03,625 --> 01:50:05,000
A nightclub singer and actress,

1959
01:50:05,083 --> 01:50:06,583
Miss Dandridge
is perhaps best known

1960
01:50:06,667 --> 01:50:10,208
for her Oscar-nominated role
as Carmen Jones.

1961
01:50:10,291 --> 01:50:11,875
The L.A. County
Coroner's Office

1962
01:50:11,959 --> 01:50:13,917
ruled that Miss Dandridge
died as a result

1963
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,875
of an overdose of
the prescription drug Tofranil.

1964
01:50:16,959 --> 01:50:19,500
However, they declined
to determine whether the death

1965
01:50:19,583 --> 01:50:22,458
was an accident or a suicide.

1966
01:50:22,542 --> 01:50:25,417
She is survived by a daughter,
Harolyn.

1967
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:28,208
Miss Dandridge was 42.
