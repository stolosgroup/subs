Sugo, keep your eyes and ears open!

17
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:34,875
It's frightening the girls.

18
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,791
They wouldn't even be scared...

19
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,875
...if you hadn't gotten lost.

20
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:42,625
Really, Papa, you grew up in Kaedwen.

21
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:45,583
King clearly dug new trails.

22
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,250
Is it true, Papa?

23
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,583
Are bandits killing innocents
along these trails?

24
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:52,333
Oh, pumpkin.

25
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:55,875
There are no bandits.

26
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,083
No!

27
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,958
Sister!

28
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,041
A witcher.

29
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,458
Fancy look.

30
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,666
You must make a killing
at druid festivals.

31
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,541
Don't usually see your sorts
around these parts.

32
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,625
Ha! I see.

33
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,416
You're a trailblazer,
flaunting the new fad.

34
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,708
Trendsetter, you.

35
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,833
Very bold!

36
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,333
Whoa, there.
People should get acquainted more, really.

37
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,000
Converse, a little foreplay.

38
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,508
Especially when
one's about to kill the other.

39
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:35,750
Though you leshens don't speak,
so there's the rub.

40
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:10,333
Forest hobo
or deadly, flapping swarm.

41
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,333
Let's pick a look...

42
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,125
...and stick with it.

43
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,125
Deadly, flapping swarm it is.

44
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,041
Away. It's not dead.

45
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,500
So kill it. You're a witcher.

46
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,750
There are several ways to kill a leshen.

47
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,041
Behead it,
sacrifice a few of its furry pets,

48
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,875
even a few old dryad spells will do.

49
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,166
Which will you...

50
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:11,708
<i>Garean bhaedh aip me vhoelynath.</i>

51
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:17,958
<i>Garean bhaedh aip me vhoelynath.</i>

52
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,708
Thought you said they don't speak?

53
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,416
<i>Garean bhaedh
aip me vhoelynath.</i>

54
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:29,958
They don't.

55
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,000
Wait!

56
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,083
Wait. I'm noble blood.

57
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,583
You can't leave me here.

58
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,208
What am I to do?

59
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,375
He said, "Practice your sad face,

60
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,375
and maybe
a passerby will offer you a ride."

61
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,875
And what of your sisters?

62
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,583
The witcher said
to use my sad face on the alderman too.

63
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,916
So he'd spare some men to...

64
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,916
gather the bodies.

65
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,541
Dry eyes, child.

66
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:31,083
I'll see that your father and sisters are
returned to you and laid to rest properly.

67
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,833
Sugo's father was
a treasured member of the Assembly

68
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,708
and a loyal subject to our king.

69
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,750
My students and I resubmit our petition.

70
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,708
Seize the witcher home of Kaer Morhen

71
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:47,291
and exile its occupants
for crimes against Kaedwen's people.

72
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,666
From what the boy told us, Your Highness,

73
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,791
the witcher slew the leshen
that was terrorizing our forests.

74
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:58,666
Lady Zerbst, since when
have leshens prowled about Kaedwen,

75
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,666
never mind with such hostility?

76
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,458
Eh?

77
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:07,083
Oh, you're suggesting the witchers
have been staging these forest attacks.

78
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:10,458
So scandalous, Madam Gilcrest.

79
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,666
Monster species have dwindled
under their swords.

80
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,708
They need coin.

81
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,750
Some have turned to mercenary work,
others criminality.

82
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,916
One even took a bounty
on a cheating husband's head.

83
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,583
And you have evidence
to prove your conspiracy?

84
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:29,041
Or are we to merely bank
on your magical intuition?

85
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,083
It's their natures, my lady.

86
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,375
Witchers are the offspring
of foul sorcery.

87
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,125
Roaming our lands,

88
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,583
voting themselves the stalkers of evil,

89
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,625
extorting coin from the gullible.

90
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:46,791
Honest, simple peasants who ascribe
all misfortune to spells and monsters.

91
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,833
Mages create the witcher.

92
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:52,583
Then presume it's our duty to hold
the bucket and mop up their brown mess.

93
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,458
I'm with Lady Zerbst on this one.

94
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,041
The witchers remain at Kaer Morhen.

95
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,958
At least until such time
as evidence is provided

96
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,000
that supports your theory.

97
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,625
When a witcher inflicts pain,

98
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,458
he experiences ecstasy.

99
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,625
The creature's words are Ellyon.

100
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,916
A dead elven dialect
linked to darker times.

101
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,416
Few remember the ancient tongue.
Fewer dare speak it.

102
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,583
But how a leshen would know it

103
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,000
or be afraid of some den...

104
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,583
Never said it was afraid.

105
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,625
You speak Ellyon, don't you, Filavandrel?

106
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,625
You witchers are desperate for coin.

107
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,666
Turning to elves for leads on work.

108
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:03,041
These pleasures do not pay for themselves.
What did the leshen say?

109
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,541
"Beware the den of my dead."

110
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,500
Hmm. Things you don't wish
to hear in a bath.

111
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,750
Did you notice anything else unusual?

112
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,000
There was an energy in the woods.

113
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,375
Some sort of magic, maybe.

114
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,416
Controlling the leshen, bewitching it.

115
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,208
What's your face?

116
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,041
Over the last four summers,

117
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,916
girls have been disappearing
from our ranks.

118
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,041
Oh, God, no elf drama.

119
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:33,250
The first we feared were
deserting us after the last cleansing.

120
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,250
- But the disappearances haven't stopped.
- Tragic, really. Very terrible.

121
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,583
One of the first to vanish
was a young mage, Kitsu.

122
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,875
She spoke Ellyon.
We should return to these forests.

123
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,541
See, I'm a monster hunter, Fil,

124
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,958
not an elf wrangler, not even
the murderous ones, but good luck.

125
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,083
A favor to a friend, then?

126
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,375
Favors and friends
don't pay bills.

127
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,666
Quite the opposite.

128
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,041
You've really no shame.

129
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,916
I have a reputation and
a healthy estimation of my talent's worth.

130
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:10,166
My apologies for trying to save you
from a wasted winter at Kaer Morhen.

131
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,541
Wasted?

132
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,791
Well, there's drinking, eating, sleeping.

133
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,166
All free.

134
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,291
And the training
of another greedy gang of young witchers.

135
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,500
I leave that to my peers.

136
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:30,708
Imagine if you witchers labored
for more than just thrill and coin.

137
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,958
Imagine if you elves wielded your swords

138
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,166
as well as you do guilt.

139
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,416
Please! Get them!

140
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,291
Vesemir, get over here!

141
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,291
Where do...
Hey! They must go!

142
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,916
Now they're nibbling. No!

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,791
Licking. Ooh! They're licking.

144
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,500
Oh! Tongues!

145
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,291
- No! Aah!
- Vesemir!

146
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,416
I told you, double knots!

147
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,625
I did, Father. Just as you showed.

148
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,166
Let's see if the boy can handle
fetching a wet cloth.

149
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,750
A lesser man
would sell your boy to another family.

150
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:19,833
Yes, sir.

151
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:24,000
At least my son proves a measure
of your generous character.

152
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,458
Head to the market.
We will need blue gum to sedate our lady.

153
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,416
- No!
- Try not to cock it up.

154
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,583
Please stop! Please make it stop!

155
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:34,666
- No.
- No!

156
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,666
Stop fidgeting!

157
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,458
Aah! Oh!

158
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,166
Oh!

159
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,708
Poor Illyana.
I didn't even have to take a shot.

160
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,625
Moron! You could've killed me.

161
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:13,625
Here to bother me?

162
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,250
The Lord insisted
I look after you in the market.

163
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,291
Seemed rather pissed.

164
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,583
We slave away all day long,
getting shout at,

165
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:26,291
and the only coin we get
is when we're sent to fetch them goods.

166
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,958
Just be happy you have a roof over
your head and your belly's not empty.

167
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:34,541
Barely a roof, barely not empty.
Just enough to keep us here breathing.

168
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,250
Fine.

169
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,625
There's the world.

170
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,083
What would you buy
if you had all its coin?

171
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:44,125
I would get the hell out of this village
and travel the continent.

172
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,958
- Adventure?
- Of course.

173
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,791
- Glory?
- Oh, yes!

174
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:48,875
Girls?

175
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,833
I'd buy a gorgeous lake house.

176
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:58,916
My handsome husband and I would picnic
and drink wine by the water

177
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,333
as our children played jacks nearby.

178
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,500
You know what we should do?

179
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,500
We should take this coin
and buy honey cake.

180
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,750
And how will our lady get her herbs?

181
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,809
- Yes, three more of those.
- Fresh mixed grills!

182
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,333
There you are, sir.

183
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,166
Stop! Thief!

184
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,791
Hey!

185
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,333
This way!

186
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,666
- Oh!
- Stop him!

187
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,833
Nutcase.

188
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,125
Mmm!

189
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,750
Save some for me!

190
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,666
See, it worked.

191
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,916
I knew it would.

192
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,166
In Nilfgaard,

193
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,958
they'd cut your thieving hands right off.

194
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,625
Make you wear 'em
round your neck for weeks.

195
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,333
Smart trick.

196
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,583
Odd loot.

197
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:22,833
Who you got who's sick?

198
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,833
Where...

199
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:31,333
Where'd a girl find balls like that
in an alley wi' a man like me?

200
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:35,500
I steal them from smelly cowards
who try to bully young ladies.

201
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,333
Who are you?

202
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:45,333
A humanitarian, whose well-meaning ears
have heard of a local lady

203
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,291
lost to madness and fever...

204
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,708
...seeing horrors that aren't really there.

205
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:55,166
That blue gum will
certainly ease the affliction, but, uh...

206
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,250
a sword would kill it.

207
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,375
Name's Deglan.

208
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,333
And you're gonna take me
to your noblewoman.

209
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,958
Or I'm taking you two pests
back to the market.

210
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,000
A demon plagues this woman.

211
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,083
A mahr.

212
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,208
Puts you down with horrid delusions
and feeds off your madness.

213
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,750
Meteorite ore disrupts the demon's magic,

214
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,833
so it can be... removed.

215
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,958
Out. Now. All of you.

216
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,416
I'd like to remain.

217
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:34,041
Your boy's likely seen
a monster or two in his time, no?

218
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,583
- Oof!
- I'll be casting the spell.

219
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,958
It's on you to catch the critter.

220
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:46,583
But I thought a witcher slays monsters?

221
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,375
To slay a beast,

222
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,416
you've first got to understand it.

223
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,958
Study it.

224
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,958
Find its weakness.

225
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,750
I want this sucker alive and kicking.

226
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:58,875
If possible.

227
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,791
Steady, young fella.

228
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:11,958
Uh...

229
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,708
And he asked to stay.

230
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,083
Never let 'em get in your head.

231
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,125
Better dead than fled.

232
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,041
There'll always be another monster.

233
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Vesemir.

234
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,000
Fetch warm water.

235
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:18,791
My head...

236
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,291
Oh, my head hurts wildly.

237
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,000
Nice weight, isn't it?

238
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,291
How much you suppose
the job cost that prick master of yours?

239
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,083
Fear and ignorance are good business.

240
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,000
For your service, young fella.

241
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,500
Take me with you.

242
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,666
Not many boys seek to be witchers.

243
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,083
Even fewer seek a life
of fetching bedpans and water.

244
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,166
And the girl?

245
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,291
Your blue-eyed lass?

246
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,333
You hesitated back with the mahr too.

247
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:13,000
Witchers do not hesitate.

248
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,250
- Stop!
- Are you going to enjoy the day?

249
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:47,083
Or are you still too shook
from your daring night of monster-slaying?

250
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,166
It was your first time, Vesemir.

251
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,208
Excuse me for wanting to be good
at something other than serving.

252
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,541
Oh, I can see it now.

253
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,875
You, adorned in battle armor,

254
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,583
steel and silver swords,

255
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:03,541
saving the continent from kikamores,
ghouls, and mad sorcerers.

256
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,291
Evil would tremble.

257
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,916
- Stylish armor, by the way.
- Imagine it however you like.

258
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:14,416
Only way people like us survive is
to dream of ourselves as something else.

259
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,291
Who knows? Perhaps someday
I'll be a princess who commands the snow.

260
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,333
Uh!

261
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,875
Vesemir, I was only jesting.

262
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,458
You find our fates funny?

263
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:34,250
Why should I be meek and penniless
like my father? Or you like your mother?

264
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,750
- What's got you so silly?
- You wouldn't understand.

265
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,125
Vesemir, out there, we're nothing.

266
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:41,916
Less than nothing.

267
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,000
At least here,
at the estate, we have station.

268
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,750
And if I could take care of you?

269
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,791
The coin that witcher made last night,

270
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,416
you should've saw it.

271
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,791
I'd get you your lake house,
all your wine.

272
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,416
Anything and everything.

273
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Yours.

274
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,583
So trade my debt to a master I hate

275
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,083
with a debt to one that I love?

276
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,708
Wait, Illyana! Stay!

277
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,333
You stay.

278
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,916
Lord Vesemir,

279
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,291
my new best friend.

280
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,416
Crossed a leshen on my way here.

281
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,500
So we've heard.

282
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,250
Meanwhile, I barely made enough this year

283
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,791
to score a night
with a limp-pricked man-whore.

284
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,541
Your woes break me, Luka.

285
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:59,041
Then we've got Sven here
bringing back new recruits.

286
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,541
Bad enough
we're putting ourselves out of business

287
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,416
with every monster we kill.

288
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,708
Now there'll be even more of us.

289
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,750
Not my fault
people make more kids than coin.

290
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,166
Also, short a man-whore?

291
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,125
Go fuck yourself.

292
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,916
Aren't you "short" everything?

293
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,291
Boys,
monsters will fuck through the winter,

294
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:22,208
then come spring,
there'll be jobs from here to Nazair.

295
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,666
Until then, I say we perk up,

296
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,750
drink up,

297
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:30,041
and you two focus on breaking these brats
into the world of witchering.

298
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,500
"Witchers are rogues
without virtue."

299
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:39,666
"True diabolical creatures,
fit only for killing."

300
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:44,250
"There is no place
amidst honest men for them."

301
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,750
My, my. How do you find this rubbish?

302
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:51,583
A few of the boys spotted 'em
posted about towns on their way back.

303
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:54,500
"Tetra Gilcrest." Sounds like a botanist.

304
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,208
A purist.

305
00:22:56,666 --> 00:23:00,583
Rambles about being a descendant
of the first human mage.

306
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:03,166
Would it have vexed you
to bury that lad's sisters?

307
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,833
You're feeding fodder
to arses like Gilcrest.

308
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,166
That's a wyvern tooth, not a basilisk.

309
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,958
I'll mix and match as I please.

310
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:13,583
Look.

311
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:17,125
- You know me and children.
- Get over it, young fella.

312
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:19,583
'Cause you're teaching fencing
to the recruits.

313
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:23,333
- Am I being punished?
- I'm down two dozen witchers this winter.

314
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:28,083
Wimps found employ
in other more lucrative nonsense.

315
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,791
So we'll all be slogging more weight.

316
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:34,125
A wonderful winter
of abandoned little tragedies.

317
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:35,041
Lovely.

318
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,416
Now, this leshen.

319
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,875
Tell me you've considered
the thing was bewitched.

320
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,916
I'm not a dullard.

321
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,333
A croon could pull that feat.

322
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:47,416
A higher vampire, definitely.

323
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:51,083
Or it could be a new breed of leshen.

324
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:54,875
Actually, just elves airing
their usual dirty trousers of victimhood.

325
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,958
Shame.

326
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:01,250
A few new beasts would be...
good for business.

327
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,208
Why'd the witcher not handle this?

328
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:11,416
- Lies and conspiracy.
- Look away from the faces.

329
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:14,791
I'd heard
the leshen'd been killed.

330
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:22,208
A whiff of basilisk breath
could snuff out ten strong men.

331
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:26,041
Did you find
the creature's body?

332
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,291
A witcher would need proof
to collect his coin.

333
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,458
And yet...

334
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,166
At least help me persuade the king

335
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,958
to send an envoy
to Kaer Morhen to investigate, please.

336
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:41,458
Your acolytes have played
to people's fears well enough.

337
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:44,250
The mere act of sending an envoy
would indict the witchers,

338
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:45,916
whatever the truth.

339
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:48,875
Do you know
what's involved in making a witcher?

340
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:52,125
The horrors done to their recruits?

341
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:54,958
Boys no older than your orphans here.

342
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:58,416
Your late husband
would've understood this.

343
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:01,250
I was an ardent admirer of Lord Zerbst.

344
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,000
He was open-minded.

345
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:05,791
Forward-thinking.

346
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:08,291
Married you, after all.

347
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:10,541
Careful, Tetra.

348
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:12,291
Or be quiet.

349
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:16,083
Kaedwen's laws grant a widow
her husband's seat at court.

350
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:18,791
The laws say nothing
about erasing what she once was.

351
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:21,750
Well, how fortunate, my lady,

352
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:24,208
that few have wished to press the issue.

353
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,458
You ain't fed us in days!

354
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:47,208
We ain't given sleep, can barely stand up.

355
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:49,833
Now you got us playing with swords?

356
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:53,958
I don't wish to be here
any more than you do.

357
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:56,041
I'll hazard a guess.

358
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:59,583
You all imagine there are better fates
for you out there in the world.

359
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,666
But out there, you have nothing.

360
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:05,916
But here, we offer strength.

361
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,750
Purpose.

362
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,750
Respect.

363
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:13,958
A chance at surviving
the very horrors waiting out there.

364
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:17,041
If you don't want that, then this...

365
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:21,541
is wasted on you.

366
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,083
"And if you don't want that,

367
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:29,000
then this is wasted on ya."

368
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:31,666
Ugh. That dorbel's full of shit.

369
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,000
Master Deglan's preparing us for the Path.

370
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,208
Better hardship here than out there.

371
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:39,416
Oh, there's a freeze tonight.

372
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:44,291
Shut up and steal what sleep you can.

373
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,583
Ah, don't mind Tomas.

374
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:49,958
Law of Surprise.

375
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,875
Didn't know he belonged to the witchers
till one came knocking.

376
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:54,125
Law of Surprise?

377
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:57,750
Fancy name for when you can't
pay a witcher. Give 'em your kid.

378
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:01,291
Were you sold,
or did you volunteer?

379
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:04,000
Uh, my folks dumped me here.
Like most.

380
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:06,416
Who chooses to be in this pigsty?

381
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,791
- Don't be so scared.
- They're...

382
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,000
- They're going to poison us.
- Who?

383
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,250
There are mages here.

384
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,333
Old ones.

385
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:20,416
Making witchers, they...

386
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,875
They'll kill us. Then bring us back, but...

387
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:24,750
we won't be normal.

388
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:29,000
- They call it...
- The Trial of the Grasses. I know.

389
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:30,416
I get scared too.

390
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:33,708
Then I think,
"Soon, I'll be out on the Path,

391
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:36,666
stronger than most anyone,
wanting for nothing."

392
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:38,541
I'll never be scared again.

393
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:43,833
You'll come out the Trials
better than normal, Tomas.

394
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:45,708
On my word.

395
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:05,916
- What the...
- It's Vesemir!

396
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:11,000
What's happened?
Where are we?

397
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:14,041
Quiet.
My pa used to talk about this place.

398
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:16,333
It's the Red Swamp.

399
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:17,625
It's cursed.

400
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:20,666
It's crawling
with evil spirits and beasts.

401
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,333
Griffins.

402
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:23,875
This is a test.

403
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,708
Like all the others.

404
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:29,500
On the Path,
a witcher's first instinct is to survive.

405
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,083
It's about wits, not swords.

406
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:34,458
We follow the moon until we're clear.

407
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:36,583
If there's a monster close,
your medallion will...

408
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:50,541
- Wraiths!
- Keep calm!

409
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:52,708
Stay together!

410
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,208
Huh?

411
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,750
This way.

412
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:07,291
Uh...

413
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Oh...

414
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:05,958
Oh!

415
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:43,916
The medallions sometimes sense
the bestiary.

416
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,666
- Especially when it's full.
- You're one of them.

417
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,625
The mages Tomas mentioned
who make witchers.

418
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:53,041
You don't look ancient.

419
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:55,708
Well, mages age quite slowly.

420
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:56,916
Witchers do too.

421
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,541
Gives us both decades
to hone our respective skills.

422
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:01,916
The Trials are only part

423
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,791
of my duty, though.

424
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:05,500
Don't fear.

425
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:08,916
It's merely a side effect
of its hybrid genes.

426
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,750
Krallachs.

427
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:14,208
I've identified three different species
in this specimen's makeup.

428
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:16,625
It's a nasty little crossbreed.

429
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:20,458
Master Deglan said
monsters can't mate with other species.

430
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:24,291
True. Though they can be engineered.

431
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:27,708
Imagine an army of beasts

432
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:30,916
designed to wipe out
the elves and the Old Races

433
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,125
to secure land and food.

434
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:35,208
The alchemy was...

435
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:36,583
inelegant, though.

436
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,708
Most crossbreeds died instantly.

437
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:42,458
Mages made monsters,

438
00:32:42,541 --> 00:32:44,666
then made witchers to kill them?

439
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:48,458
Today, my mages and I
guard the secrets

440
00:32:48,541 --> 00:32:50,833
to such mutagenic alchemy,

441
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:53,166
preventing further abuse.

442
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,375
I'm Reidrich, by the way.

443
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:57,208
Are you daft, Reidrich?

444
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:01,541
A witcher deserves
to understand its place in history.

445
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:04,500
A rider came
while you were licking your wounds.

446
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:05,833
Left a letter for ya.

447
00:33:05,916 --> 00:33:09,125
Did you know that Tomas and the others
would die in the swamp?

448
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:11,375
It's a numbers game, young fella.

449
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:14,375
How many survive these Trials?

450
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:17,041
Depends. How many are witchers?

451
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,750
Letter's by your cot.
Read it now, before I burn it.

452
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,458
<i>"Vesemir."</i>

453
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:34,166
<i>"Your thoughts are likely far from here,
so I will be brief."</i>

454
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:36,416
<i>"Your father is dead."</i>

455
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:38,750
<i>"Kaedwen took our village</i>

456
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:41,166
<i>and he was killed
while helping the lord and lady escape,</i>

457
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,333
<i>both of whom were also slain."</i>

458
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:46,000
<i>"Do not return home, Vesemir,</i>

459
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:48,416
<i>if this were ever that to you."</i>

460
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:52,625
<i>"I hope you have found warmth
and comfort in this brittle world</i>

461
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:56,958
<i>and that the world is being kind to you,
and most of all, fair."</i>

462
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:02,041
<i>"For me, a noble family from Kaedwen
has claimed me theirs."</i>

463
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,791
<i>"They are kinder masters."</i>

464
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:09,000
<i>"They let me paint and show me how
to read words, as well as write a few."</i>

465
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:12,000
<i>"I am well-fed and at peace."</i>

466
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:16,875
<i>"There was little to miss
in our burnt-out town,</i>

467
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:20,000
<i>and our snowball fights
and alleyway desserts</i>

468
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:23,500
<i>are heavy memories
I now happily lay to rest."</i>

469
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:26,541
<i>"Find your rebirth, Vesemir,</i>

470
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:29,375
<i>free of past burdens and hurts."</i>

471
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:31,333
<i>"And yes,</i>

472
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:33,500
<i>free of me."</i>

473
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,833
<i>"It is best that way."</i>

474
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:38,583
<i>"Live and love well."</i>

475
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:40,541
<i>"Illyana."</i>

476
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:57,916
Right. So, who wishes to ride
and get blitzed somewhere nice and quiet?

477
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,500
We stay and see who survives.

478
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:03,250
That could take days.

479
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,250
It'll be Eskel, Lambert,

480
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:06,833
maybe Remus.

481
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:10,708
Now, can we please go
get right properly drunk?

482
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:12,291
Oh, let them sulk.

483
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:13,916
We'll drink.

484
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:21,458
The midwife almost fainted
when I came for my payment.

485
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:24,958
I looked an awful terror, red and sticky,

486
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:27,708
but, you know, that's the job.

487
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:30,041
And the striga? Was she cured?

488
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:31,666
Yes. Yes, of course.

489
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:35,041
We need more before the next tale.

490
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:39,833
You know, that midwife
should've hired a better savior.

491
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:41,458
A man of virtue and honor.

492
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:43,125
A real man.

493
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:44,833
Not a mutant.

494
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:47,583
Are knights being schooled
in striga curses now?

495
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:51,500
Where'd that lesson fit?
Between learning curtsy and joust?

496
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:55,041
We're all here for a little drink
and non-violent fun.

497
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:57,958
Ugh.

498
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:00,916
Is this the "your kind" bit?

499
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:03,583
You frighten these people.

500
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:06,625
As you frightened
that midwife you swindled.

501
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:08,666
Best you leave.

502
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,083
Right now.

503
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:13,541
I've seen knights try to do our job.

504
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:15,833
Tidy up monsters.

505
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:18,083
Cautionary tales, all of you.

506
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:20,708
Especially the cute ones.

507
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:28,000
The two witchers should be tried
and executed. No questions asked.

508
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,625
Silly me.

509
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:33,791
Here I thought
trials were all about questions.

510
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:37,333
These two killed two of your guard,
Your Highness. You'd let that stand?

511
00:37:37,416 --> 00:37:41,250
Sire, the barkeep claims
your knights instigated the altercation.

512
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:44,583
These witchers were defending themselves.

513
00:37:45,291 --> 00:37:49,375
The people's faith in the monarchy
already wavers due to the forest attacks.

514
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:53,083
Now they'll hear the crown waxed idly
as two monsters shed knighted blood.

515
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:55,083
So we should go to war with the witchers?

516
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:57,833
If only so you can
make them what you fear?

517
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,250
They are deadly. On that, we agree, Tetra.

518
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:04,750
And such a battle would flood Kaedwen red.

519
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:08,375
The Assembly should remember
the lady's seat here is honorary.

520
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:11,666
Yet it is still my chair.

521
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,083
Earned by her body. Not by blood or title.

522
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:17,625
Gods, quiet!

523
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:21,500
I'll have my knights kill you both
for the sake of my ears.

524
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:24,166
Tetra's right, actually, sire.

525
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:27,375
Your subjects expect action.

526
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:30,583
What if you act
on two fronts with one move?

527
00:38:30,666 --> 00:38:34,625
Clear out our forests
while also avoiding war with the witchers?

528
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:43,958
Guard?

529
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:45,250
Aye?

530
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:47,333
Do you hear that?

531
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:49,666
- It's like this pinging noise.
- Hey!

532
00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:53,333
Are you eager for a beating, mutant?

533
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:56,875
I'd settle for a pot to piss in
and some halfway decent bread, please.

534
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Oof!

535
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:04,333
Ah. A bit generous, but...

536
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,166
No need to split this one.

537
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:15,375
Not like when we were younger.

538
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,041
I knew witchers aged differently,
but, well, look at you!

539
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,541
Illyana!

540
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:27,333
No doubt you imagined me
an old spinster by now, slaving away.

541
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:30,333
That is if you ever imagine me at all.

542
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:31,625
Uh... your letter.

543
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,125
- You'd been sold to a new estate.
- Yes.

544
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:37,333
The Zerbsts of Kaedwen.

545
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,333
They were kind enough, but it...

546
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:43,000
it was their son who was
truly fond of me, despite my station.

547
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:47,083
It's been an age.
Did you ever get that lake house?

548
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:50,583
Lake house? Oh, my, the lake house!

549
00:39:50,666 --> 00:39:52,375
No lake, no.

550
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:54,250
But a nice home.

551
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:57,750
Turned it into an orphanage
after my husband passed.

552
00:39:57,833 --> 00:40:00,208
We had children too. Girls.

553
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:02,500
Horrors, all three of them.

554
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:05,041
One just made me a grandmother.
I begged her not to.

555
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:07,500
But they're
stubborn little needlers.

556
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:09,458
They often remind me of you...

557
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:11,375
Oh, gods.

558
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:13,750
I'm... rambling.

559
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,166
You're bored.

560
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,958
No, no, no. You're fine.

561
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:20,291
You're good. Uh... this is unexpected, yes.

562
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:23,708
Little fresh. But, uh... also lovely.

563
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:25,625
You've had such a full...

564
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:30,208
You wish to kill my already-dead husband
and burn the orphanage to the ground.

565
00:40:31,166 --> 00:40:33,333
Not the precise words I'd use.

566
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:38,750
Lord Zerbst was kind to me.

567
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:41,416
By no means perfect, but...

568
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:46,125
he's someone you miss very much
when they depart.

569
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:50,750
The tales I've heard of you, though.

570
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:54,166
The swashbuckling witcher for hire.

571
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,250
"The slayer Vesemir,

572
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:59,333
priced only for the foulest of creatures."

573
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:03,375
Well, not too long ago, you were stuffing
my head full of those very notions.

574
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:06,750
Years do work differently for you.

575
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:08,666
What's time, anyway?

576
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:11,750
Everything.

577
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:16,791
The king is willing to grant you
and your friend amnesty for your crimes.

578
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:19,375
Then you are reminded
that I carry the duties

579
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:23,666
of my late husband, the noble Lord Zerbst,
adviser to the throne.

580
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:26,000
Every deal has a price.

581
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:29,833
Kill whatever is murdering our people
in the woods outside Ard Carraigh.

582
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:31,333
And my colleague, Luka?

583
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:33,958
- He'll have my care.
- Reasonable terms.

584
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:36,333
You'll take a chaperone too.

585
00:41:36,416 --> 00:41:38,125
That, there, well...

586
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
that's a problem.

587
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:42,250
The Path's quite perilous,

588
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,500
and you are a lady, my lady.

589
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:48,958
Also, can't have a noble such as you

590
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:51,833
seen slumming about
with the mutant likes of me.

591
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:56,000
Then you'll no doubt be pleased
to hear that I am not your chaperone.

592
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:05,291
I have no intention
of playing guide or nurse to you, witch.

593
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:07,416
I don't care
who your great-great-whoever was.

594
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:13,791
On my word,

595
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,083
I will slay this beast.

596
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,416
For you, Illyana.

597
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:32,463
Might not be a monster
at all, either.

598
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,625
The leshen that killed your man Carlisle
was bewitched.

599
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:36,958
By an elf.

600
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:39,500
"Why an elf?" Ah! Glad you asked.

601
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:42,375
See, another very old
but very young-looking elf

602
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:46,041
asked me to help him
to find a group of misplaced girls.

603
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:50,166
Point is, witchering is a business.

604
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,583
You have to keep a brand.

605
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:56,166
Can't score the big jobs if you're known
for swatting nymphs and helping out elves.

606
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,708
Isn't fire magic forbidden
by upstanding mages?

607
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:04,125
Only insofar as
there are very few mages blessed

608
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:06,208
with the skill to control the flames.

609
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,333
Huh.
You're very special, clearly.

610
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:14,625
I must seem silly to you.

611
00:43:15,416 --> 00:43:16,791
But Chaos, it's...

612
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:20,208
Well, words fail description.

613
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:24,125
Witchers are connected to Chaos too.

614
00:43:24,208 --> 00:43:27,208
Only your connection
is corrupted and corrosive.

615
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:28,416
And far less condemning.

616
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:36,166
There's a story about a witcher
who helped an ailing priest.

617
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:40,000
The monster-slayer believed
the sickness was, in fact, a curse,

618
00:43:41,416 --> 00:43:43,833
and could be lifted
by killing whoever placed it.

619
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:47,041
The priest quickly fingered
a local sorceress,

620
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,375
a stupid girl
who always caused him trouble.

621
00:43:50,291 --> 00:43:54,166
The witcher killed her,
and was rightly paid in gems and jewels.

622
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:58,833
- The priest obviously got better.
- He did.

623
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:01,166
And then a few days later,

624
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:04,958
he found a beautiful gem
amid his cook's belongings,

625
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:08,166
identical to the one
he'd given the clever witcher.

626
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,666
Ah. He had the cook poison
the priest's meals.

627
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,333
Cut him in on the take.

628
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:15,166
Smart con.
Wish I'd thought of it.

629
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:16,916
As I said...

630
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:18,666
corrupted.

631
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Ah, lovely.

632
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,166
- You've led us in a circle.
- No.

633
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,416
I know these forests.

634
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,458
Hmm. So did Lord Carlisle.

635
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:41,958
At Aretuza, we used magic to cast pleasant
illusions around unpleasant foods.

636
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:43,791
Made food tastier,

637
00:44:43,875 --> 00:44:46,041
yet the aftertaste of the illusion?

638
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:49,208
Bitter.

639
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:56,458
Chaos clear our hearts and minds.
Let our eyes see right and true.

640
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:59,166
Lift the shroud that cloaks our mind.

641
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:02,750
Lift the shroud that cloaks our mind!

642
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:18,458
That illusion was flawless.

643
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:21,791
The power needed to maintain such art...

644
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:24,458
Could also bewitch a leshen.

645
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:37,500
<i>Garean bhaedh aip me vhoelynath.</i>

646
00:45:37,583 --> 00:45:39,625
- Kitsu?
- Friend of yours?

647
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:40,958
Friend of a friend.

648
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:44,000
<i>Garean bhaedh aip me vhoelynath!</i>

649
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:48,375
Yes. I'll need to know what
and where your den is if I'm to avoid it,

650
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:50,375
especially since you're, you know,

651
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:52,166
- slaughtering people over it.
- Witcher.

652
00:45:56,708 --> 00:45:58,916
I've never seen
such a species of basilisk.

653
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:01,875
- Another illusion?
- We'll no doubt find out shortly.

654
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,750
I know. She has that effect on everyone.

655
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:39,541
But still, manners.

656
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,000
No!

657
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:54,416
No!

658
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:57,791
- It was real.
- Might have slightly underestimated you.

659
00:47:58,291 --> 00:47:59,416
Slightly.

660
00:48:00,416 --> 00:48:01,916
Ah.

661
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,708
Kitsu, this needn't escalate.

662
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:12,958
Uh...

663
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:19,958
Oh!

664
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:35,541
Witcher!

665
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:02,291
Her powers of illusion are unnatural.

666
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:04,750
First monster
I ever encountered was a mahr.

667
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:08,458
Made a woman see nightmares
that weren't really there. Illusions.

668
00:49:08,541 --> 00:49:11,875
- Kitsu's an elf.
- Then why does she smell like a mahr?

669
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:20,916
An elven school.

670
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,291
They used to send their young here
during high summer.

671
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:29,041
Before repurposing it as a garrison
during your last cleansing spree.

672
00:49:31,666 --> 00:49:32,916
No signs of blood.

673
00:49:34,625 --> 00:49:36,375
I can still smell her, though.

674
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:38,041
Yes.

675
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,375
She was here.

676
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:41,583
Just before our fight.

677
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:20,541
Witcher!

678
00:50:21,166 --> 00:50:22,666
I do have a name, you know.

679
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,500
Ugh!

680
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:29,875
What was done to them?

681
00:50:31,833 --> 00:50:33,250
They're all elves.

682
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Girls.

683
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:36,500
Over here.

684
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:37,583
Help.

685
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:50,500
Gods, not another favor.

686
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:53,333
Who's this one?

687
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:57,875
My aforementioned friend.
He was searching for those girls.

688
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:03,041
And I could've saved some, had you
set aside your love of coin and helped.

689
00:51:03,541 --> 00:51:08,083
- Kitsu's been kidnapping them.
- Yes. Experimenting on the girls.

690
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:10,916
She's using some strange alchemy
to try to change them.

691
00:51:11,916 --> 00:51:13,750
Change them to what?

692
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:15,458
Into whatever she's become.

693
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:20,083
I tracked her here,
tried stopping her, but... Kitsu's power...

694
00:51:20,166 --> 00:51:21,750
And she just let you live?

695
00:51:21,833 --> 00:51:25,541
I understand if that's a concept
unfamiliar to your kind.

696
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:28,541
If Kitsu was using sorcery
to try and mutate those girls,

697
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:29,791
who mutated her?

698
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:36,458
Her genes were spliced
with those of a mahr.

699
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:39,041
It explains her unnatural power.

700
00:51:39,666 --> 00:51:40,916
She's a crossbreed.

701
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,708
How is such a thing possible?

702
00:51:42,791 --> 00:51:44,375
The same way he was made.

703
00:51:45,166 --> 00:51:46,583
Mutagenic alchemy.

704
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:49,500
Its secrets known
only to mages at Kaer Morhen.

705
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:51,208
You're behind all this.

706
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:52,375
That's ridiculous.

707
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:56,875
Hunting monsters for coin wasn't enough?

708
00:51:57,541 --> 00:51:59,041
Now you make them?

709
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:00,875
Witchers are struggling, yes, but...

710
00:52:02,083 --> 00:52:06,458
Shame. A few new beasts would be...
good for business.

711
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,250
More monsters,
more jobs, more coin.

712
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:11,708
Another sharp con.

713
00:52:11,791 --> 00:52:13,708
I swear, Fil, I didn't...

714
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:22,666
Another monstrosity.

715
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:28,791
She's still an elf.

716
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:35,166
You saw what these creatures can do.

717
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:38,375
Fil, if the girl has
even half Kitsu's power,

718
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:40,250
she's dangerous.

719
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:42,625
Doesn't this witch say similar of you?

720
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:47,416
I will take her back to my people.
She will be raised as an elf.

721
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,333
Charitable.

722
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:52,083
Though I imagine it won't be too long
before you sic her on us.

723
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:53,375
You won.

724
00:52:54,583 --> 00:52:56,083
You beat us.

725
00:52:56,166 --> 00:52:57,833
At least allow us the indignity

726
00:52:57,916 --> 00:53:01,250
of scavenging whatever's left of our kind,
mutant or otherwise.

727
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:04,541
As a favor to a friend.

728
00:53:07,041 --> 00:53:09,166
Take the child and go. Now.

729
00:53:10,708 --> 00:53:13,083
You have made a serious error.

730
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:16,291
Should that girl ever harm
a single soul, Fil...

731
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:17,750
Then I will slay her.

732
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:21,333
Quietly welcome you and your sword.

733
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:27,416
I should've offered up some coin.
Then you would've handled matters.

734
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,375
It was not a question of price.

735
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,875
Oh, the witcher's found his morals?

736
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:36,000
You think you're so pure, Tetra?
Not a blemish?

737
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:38,625
Look outside. There's your morality.

738
00:53:39,291 --> 00:53:41,625
Rot and ruin all reeking of hate.

739
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:44,250
Tend to that filth, and I'll tend to mine.

740
00:54:48,666 --> 00:54:50,833
Nothing good
can come of this.

741
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:53,375
Fear and ignorance
are good business.

742
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:55,625
That's what Deglan said
the first time we met.

743
00:54:56,166 --> 00:54:57,166
Now look.

744
00:54:58,041 --> 00:54:59,458
I need to know for certain.

745
00:55:00,666 --> 00:55:03,041
I'd ask you to flee with me.

746
00:55:07,166 --> 00:55:08,791
I know what you have to do.

747
00:55:09,458 --> 00:55:13,750
And I won't have you feeling
as though you've abandoned me again.

748
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:42,458
I tried to stop him.

749
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:45,750
But witchers, they never hesitate.

750
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:52,375
Madam Gilcrest has given proof.

751
00:55:52,458 --> 00:55:54,625
This one breeds monstrosities,

752
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:56,500
terrorizes my kingdom,

753
00:55:57,083 --> 00:55:59,375
and swindles the people.

754
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:03,833
What the hell are you talking about?

755
00:56:04,416 --> 00:56:07,791
Sire, not all witchers were aware
of these crossbreeds.

756
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:10,833
Lady Zerbst,
you are testament to the perils

757
00:56:10,916 --> 00:56:13,958
of trusting a servant.

758
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:16,208
Your Highness...

759
00:56:19,416 --> 00:56:21,458
If it pleases, sire,

760
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:24,916
might I ask where Madam Gilcrest is now?

761
00:57:22,083 --> 00:57:24,333
Monsters were going extinct.

762
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:26,083
I had to protect our way of life.

763
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:29,666
Think of all the coin
you stand to make, young fella.

764
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:32,791
- Do not call me that.
- Check your gratitude, boy.

765
00:57:32,875 --> 00:57:34,000
You came to me.

766
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,916
I could've shipped you right back
to those bedpans.

767
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,333
Don't pretend you didn't know
exactly what you were doing

768
00:57:39,416 --> 00:57:40,916
when you threw me those coins.

769
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,291
You knew I would come.

770
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,041
We were created
to kill creatures like these,

771
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:46,375
not to make them.

772
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:48,708
I won't weep for doing what needed doing.

773
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:50,875
I told you.

774
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:52,791
A witcher never hesitates.

775
00:57:52,875 --> 00:57:53,958
Oh, I know.

776
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:57,958
What about with the elf? Did you give
Kitsu a choice before you mutated her?

777
00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:00,333
No, I thought we'd killed her.

778
00:58:00,416 --> 00:58:03,375
That mutation was unstable.
Too much power.

779
00:58:04,041 --> 00:58:07,500
Clearly, her death was one
of her clever little illusions.

780
00:58:07,583 --> 00:58:09,500
All of this to line our pockets.

781
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:14,041
You were always too focused
on the gold in your hand.

782
00:58:14,708 --> 00:58:17,833
You never looked up
to see who's paying you. See their eyes.

783
00:58:18,416 --> 00:58:19,416
We terrify 'em.

784
00:58:19,916 --> 00:58:23,000
The only thing keeping men from hunting us

785
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,666
are the scarier beasts we keep away.

786
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:31,416
Humans die quick, so they spend
their lives fearing and hating.

787
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,916
Ask the dwarves or your elf friend.

788
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,375
Men will always need monsters.

789
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:39,625
- Now, so do we.
- We're all orphans.

790
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:42,166
We've always looked to you to protect us.

791
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:45,791
You have to burn it to the ground...
or I will.

792
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,333
I don't want to fight you.

793
00:58:54,416 --> 00:58:56,375
We've got to protect ourselves, Vesemir.

794
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:01,791
Got to protect you!

795
00:59:08,666 --> 00:59:13,041
If you two would like to stop
trying to kill each other,

796
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,208
we have a visitor.

797
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,166
She's coming.

798
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:31,250
Away with all witchers!

799
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:34,625
Tetra wasted no time. Word spread quickly.

800
00:59:35,291 --> 00:59:38,583
Not only of the crossbreeds,
but of witchers protecting elves.

801
00:59:39,083 --> 00:59:40,125
And Luka?

802
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:43,500
This is your two's doing.

803
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:46,250
They were always gonna come,
sooner or later.

804
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:49,791
Well, maybe there was a way
for us to die the better men.

805
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:54,333
My mages and I are the ones
who know the secrets to mutagenic alchemy.

806
00:59:54,416 --> 00:59:56,916
Tetra will want our heads most.

807
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,583
If we die,

808
00:59:59,208 --> 01:00:02,291
there can be no more witchers.

809
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:05,291
Seal yourselves in your labs.

810
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:07,875
The rest of us will rally
and end her little cult.

811
01:00:08,458 --> 01:00:09,708
Bitch won't see dawn.

812
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:15,625
Underestimate Tetra and you'll be the one
who's seen their last sunrise.

813
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:22,583
Perhaps she'll listen to reason.

814
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:26,291
He may be a bastard... but Deglan is right.

815
01:00:27,166 --> 01:00:28,458
This was inevitable.

816
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:29,583
Why?

817
01:00:29,666 --> 01:00:31,666
Because you're different.

818
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:34,125
And killing
is easier than tolerating.

819
01:00:36,416 --> 01:00:38,500
I want you as far away from this place
as possible.

820
01:00:38,583 --> 01:00:40,166
There are children here.

821
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:43,416
- They've been trained.
- Children, Vesemir.

822
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,416
As you were when he took you.

823
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,583
I'll guide them to the cellar
until the battle's won.

824
01:00:49,166 --> 01:00:52,875
For once, I will decide my place.

825
01:00:53,708 --> 01:00:55,333
You've always had too much fire.

826
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,166
And beauty.

827
01:00:57,250 --> 01:01:00,333
Please... I'm nearly 70.

828
01:01:05,041 --> 01:01:06,041
So am I.

829
01:01:31,833 --> 01:01:34,916
Beautiful peaks. Too pure for war.

830
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,958
Scurry off and return with the body
of the man you murdered, witch.

831
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:44,000
He was executed in the name
of those your homemade beasts butchered.

832
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,666
There'll be no more of them, Tetra.

833
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:47,750
Upon my word.

834
01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:51,541
Well, witchers are experts in price.

835
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:54,166
What is the worth of your word, Vesemir?

836
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:55,250
Some things...

837
01:01:56,083 --> 01:01:57,291
are beyond cost.

838
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:00,333
And you?

839
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:02,583
Do you give me your word?

840
01:02:03,125 --> 01:02:04,625
I give you nothing.

841
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:09,500
Save the chance to fill the valleys
of our pretty peaks with your corpses.

842
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:12,250
We are an army of witchers.

843
01:02:12,333 --> 01:02:13,541
You are human.

844
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:03,250
Kitsu.

845
01:03:03,291 --> 01:03:05,958
She was gutted
to hear how you sacked her den,

846
01:03:06,041 --> 01:03:09,791
destroyed her work,
and murdered the girl, her only child.

847
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:12,791
Monsters to fight monsters.

848
01:03:13,416 --> 01:03:14,875
How unlike your predecessors.

849
01:03:24,916 --> 01:03:27,083
Rally! Rally!

850
01:03:27,166 --> 01:03:29,666
Steel your nerves, lads. We charge!

851
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:32,875
- Swords away. Swords away!
- We haven't time to hesitate.

852
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:34,500
Just bloody trust me for once!

853
01:03:37,833 --> 01:03:38,833
Please!

854
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:44,958
Witchers, on me!

855
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:56,041
Now!

856
01:04:04,166 --> 01:04:06,958
Be calm. Be calm.

857
01:04:07,041 --> 01:04:08,041
You're safe.

858
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:08,583
Witchers must be wiped
from the surface of this Earth,

859
01:05:08,666 --> 01:05:11,833
and all traces strewn
with salt and saltpeter.

860
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:39,500
She's going for Reidrich!

861
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:44,458
Me and the others will hold the bridge.
Use the drop to halve their numbers.

862
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,083
You two, stop her!

863
01:05:49,291 --> 01:05:51,458
Can you forgive me long enough,
young fella?

864
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:06,041
If she gets Reidrich, it's the end of us.

865
01:08:08,625 --> 01:08:09,875
Find her!

866
01:08:11,583 --> 01:08:13,833
Stop her!

867
01:08:24,875 --> 01:08:26,875
There's a hatch in the grain hold.

868
01:08:26,958 --> 01:08:29,041
It lets out on the back pathway.

869
01:08:29,125 --> 01:08:30,375
How do you know this?

870
01:08:30,458 --> 01:08:32,000
He was trying to run away!

871
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:36,666
Run as far away as possible.

872
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:37,583
All of you.

873
01:08:37,666 --> 01:08:40,458
Rub the heel raw,
to the bone, if you have to.

874
01:08:40,541 --> 01:08:41,583
Don't stop.

875
01:08:55,625 --> 01:08:57,291
Lower your swords.

876
01:08:59,541 --> 01:09:01,333
This is genocide, Tetra.

877
01:09:01,916 --> 01:09:06,125
They bred those monsters because of you.
There is no purity here.

878
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:08,000
Just fear and hatred.

879
01:09:08,083 --> 01:09:10,541
Enough, please!

880
01:09:11,375 --> 01:09:14,041
This servant betrays Kaedwen
to the witchers.

881
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,166
Let her join them.

882
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Tetra!

883
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:27,458
I can drop your men
before their blades drop an inch.

884
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:29,791
Wishful thinking.

885
01:09:39,541 --> 01:09:42,916
Are you going to enjoy the day,
or are you still too shook

886
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,208
from another daring night
of monster-slaying?

887
01:09:45,708 --> 01:09:49,666
Pardon me for wanting to be
something other than a churlish knave.

888
01:09:50,166 --> 01:09:51,416
Look at you, though.

889
01:09:52,708 --> 01:09:54,041
You're a witcher.

890
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:56,041
You're rich!

891
01:09:57,291 --> 01:09:59,000
We'll lack for nothing,

892
01:09:59,541 --> 01:10:02,000
and you'll take care of me, Vesemir.

893
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:04,875
Much like you said. True to your word.

894
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:11,083
- Look at me.
- A lake house.

895
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:14,208
Wine. Food.

896
01:10:14,291 --> 01:10:18,083
Imagine the seas of coin we'd wade in.

897
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:22,416
You never wanted that!
You were always content.

898
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
No, no, no!

899
01:10:26,125 --> 01:10:28,416
Forty tons of sheep's blood?

900
01:10:29,166 --> 01:10:30,833
That poor midwife!

901
01:10:30,916 --> 01:10:34,875
Oh, oh, tell 'em about the time
you swindled the Redanian priest.

902
01:10:34,958 --> 01:10:37,208
Had him thinking he was cursed!

903
01:10:37,791 --> 01:10:41,875
- How much did you take that fool for?
- You can't be here. We lost you.

904
01:10:45,125 --> 01:10:46,833
What are you prattling about?

905
01:10:48,041 --> 01:10:52,750
Wake the barkeep,
drain the barrels. Everyone drink!

906
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,583
Not a coin spared.

907
01:10:55,666 --> 01:10:58,000
Yeah!

908
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:04,458
Enough! All of you!

909
01:11:04,541 --> 01:11:06,166
Stop... stop cackling!

910
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:08,000
Vesemir, come look.

911
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:11,166
Be honest, now.

912
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:14,333
Well, don't just stand there. Say it.

913
01:11:16,583 --> 01:11:18,750
You hate it, don't you?

914
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:19,833
I...

915
01:11:21,166 --> 01:11:24,333
I was just weighing whether you'd done
my dashing looks justice.

916
01:11:24,416 --> 01:11:27,666
Oh, gods. You frightened me.

917
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:30,583
Such a look in your eyes.
So crestfallen and...

918
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:32,375
It's perfect, Illyana.

919
01:11:33,458 --> 01:11:34,500
Flawless.

920
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,666
Don't dally. I'm thirsty.

921
01:11:49,666 --> 01:11:51,250
Mama! Make Bojan stop!

922
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:53,250
He's run away with my jacks!

923
01:11:54,791 --> 01:11:57,708
What's wrong, Papa?
You're making the sad face.

924
01:11:58,291 --> 01:11:59,541
No, no...

925
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:01,250
This is wrong.

926
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:03,833
Enough mind games, Kitsu.
No more fantasies.

927
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:09,333
But you swore
you'd care for me, didn't you?

928
01:12:10,333 --> 01:12:11,500
That you'd protect me.

929
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:13,916
You're not real.

930
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,208
Truth is no illusion.
There's no escaping it.

931
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,458
Get away from me!

932
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:22,125
You left me here, darling.

933
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:25,041
Stranded in hopes and dreams abandoned.

934
01:12:25,125 --> 01:12:27,833
And now you're trying to leave me again.

935
01:12:27,916 --> 01:12:30,708
Only this time, I won't be buried

936
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:33,083
in dresses and courts and titles.

937
01:12:33,166 --> 01:12:36,666
I'll be as you are. Lost and alone.

938
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:38,791
Unloved!

939
01:12:38,875 --> 01:12:40,958
No, Illyana. I love you.

940
01:12:41,041 --> 01:12:42,458
Coin's your real lover.

941
01:12:43,416 --> 01:12:46,250
More of her
to pluck out there, isn't there?

942
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:47,750
Stop it.

943
01:12:47,791 --> 01:12:50,375
We can be
whatever we imagine here, Vesemir.

944
01:12:50,458 --> 01:12:51,750
We can be rich.

945
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:57,541
Together. Here, time is nothing.

946
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:00,541
Out there, I can save her.

947
01:13:01,458 --> 01:13:02,791
That's worth more.

948
01:13:02,875 --> 01:13:04,208
Now, out of my head.

949
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:41,541
I know you never asked for this.

950
01:13:42,708 --> 01:13:44,041
You were only a child.

951
01:13:44,541 --> 01:13:46,083
How were you to know?

952
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:00,791
Vesemir!

953
01:14:01,541 --> 01:14:02,625
Stay back!

954
01:14:37,333 --> 01:14:39,291
You come at me with magic tricks?

955
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,666
Oh, no...

956
01:15:21,208 --> 01:15:22,958
No! No!

957
01:15:23,625 --> 01:15:24,958
No, no, no, no!

958
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:28,375
Vesemir.

959
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:31,583
Oh.

960
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:34,500
This...

961
01:15:35,291 --> 01:15:36,416
this isn't real.

962
01:15:39,666 --> 01:15:42,500
I didn't know much about witchers
when I was young.

963
01:15:42,583 --> 01:15:45,625
I didn't know
you could smell better, hear better.

964
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:49,083
I didn't know that the witcher
sensed me in the cupboard,

965
01:15:49,166 --> 01:15:51,166
trembling, barely breathing,

966
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:54,083
watching as he drove his sword
through my mother.

967
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:58,250
The silly sorceress
who'd crossed a gullible priest.

968
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:01,250
Monsters to kill monsters.

969
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:07,375
Aye...

970
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
So...

971
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:23,791
Take her and go.

972
01:16:25,625 --> 01:16:27,916
Sven? The others?

973
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,500
Dead.

974
01:16:31,583 --> 01:16:33,000
All my boys.

975
01:16:33,791 --> 01:16:35,833
- Save you.
- The young ones...

976
01:16:36,708 --> 01:16:38,541
escaped.

977
01:16:39,166 --> 01:16:40,291
Keep your strength.

978
01:16:42,541 --> 01:16:44,625
They're your boys now, young fella.

979
01:16:45,208 --> 01:16:46,375
Make 'em witchers.

980
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:47,958
Make 'em...

981
01:16:48,541 --> 01:16:49,791
somethin' more.

982
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:54,125
To better men.

983
01:17:12,375 --> 01:17:15,333
She didn't ask for this.

984
01:18:05,875 --> 01:18:07,666
Where are we?

985
01:18:26,166 --> 01:18:27,666
Beautiful.

986
01:18:29,083 --> 01:18:31,666
It doesn't seem... real.

987
01:19:02,166 --> 01:19:03,250
Huh?

988
01:19:05,458 --> 01:19:07,875
Do we even know where we're going?

989
01:19:18,791 --> 01:19:21,666
This is the last time
I allow any of you to ever hesitate.

990
01:19:22,333 --> 01:19:23,416
Decide.

991
01:19:24,916 --> 01:19:26,291
But they hate us.

992
01:19:27,625 --> 01:19:29,250
There'll always be another monster...

993
01:19:29,333 --> 01:19:30,333
Geralt.
