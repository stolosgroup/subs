3
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,966
There are among us a people,

4
00:00:56,032 --> 00:01:00,003
gifted with a perfect memory
of all their past lives.

5
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,707
They call themselves
Infinites.

6
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:09,846
Among the Infinites,
two groups have vied for power.

7
00:01:09,913 --> 00:01:12,515
On one side the Believers,

8
00:01:12,582 --> 00:01:13,984
dedicated
to using their knowledge

9
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,487
for the protection and growth
of all humanity.

10
00:01:17,554 --> 00:01:19,856
Against them
stand the Nihilists,

11
00:01:19,923 --> 00:01:22,759
who see this power
as a curse.

12
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,729
New technologies
have given the Nihilists

13
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:28,798
an opportunity
to end all life on earth.

14
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,736
And the race is on
for its control.

15
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:06,870
Treadway,
tell me you got it.

16
00:02:06,936 --> 00:02:10,006
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.
I got it.

17
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,053
Might be delayed a little.
I'm headed to meet you now.

18
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:24,120
Copy that.

19
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,077
Treadway, you okay?

20
00:02:47,143 --> 00:02:49,779
We can't let them
get the Egg back.

21
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:53,883
I can't believe
Bathurst would go this far.

22
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,785
He's not the man
we remember.

23
00:02:56,152 --> 00:02:57,153
Shit.

24
00:03:12,135 --> 00:03:13,603
Shit.

25
00:03:37,193 --> 00:03:40,196
Abel. I'm gonna take a shortcut.
Meet me at the freeway.

26
00:05:18,795 --> 00:05:20,029
They got it blocked off.

27
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,266
- Get to the base of the crane.
- Treadway, listen.

28
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,535
Do not go up that bridge.

29
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,112
Treadway? Treadway?

30
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:41,751
Abel, listen to me.

31
00:05:41,818 --> 00:05:44,087
If I fail, look inside.

32
00:05:44,153 --> 00:05:46,256
I don't know what miracle
you think you're gonna pull off,

33
00:05:46,322 --> 00:05:49,225
but there's a 150-foot gap
in front of you.

34
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:51,060
What is his plan?

35
00:06:50,086 --> 00:06:52,055
Leona. Please.

36
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,126
Leona, wake up.
Wake up.

37
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:29,092
I'll find you
in the Beginning.

38
00:07:29,926 --> 00:07:31,427
I love you.

39
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,785
Did you ever have a dream
so real it felt like a memory?

40
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,690
You ever catch yourself in the
mirror and it's a surprise?

41
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:04,127
Like you expected to see
someone else's face

42
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:06,262
staring back at you.

43
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:13,903
All these people all going
somewhere, all doing something.

44
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,372
But what does it all add up to?

45
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,143
Maybe if I knew the answer, all the
little things might click together.

46
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,378
They might make sense.

47
00:08:22,445 --> 00:08:25,048
- Hey. Hi.
- Evan. Right on time.

48
00:08:25,114 --> 00:08:27,083
Nice to see you.
How are ya?

49
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,485
- Any trouble getting here?
- No. No, not at all.

50
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:30,920
Okay.

51
00:08:30,987 --> 00:08:32,989
Third interview this week.

52
00:08:33,056 --> 00:08:34,924
- Here he is.
- Hey, gentlemen.

53
00:08:34,991 --> 00:08:36,159
Hey. How are you?

54
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,261
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Evan, great to meet you.

55
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:41,097
Thank you so much for your time.
I really appreciate it.

56
00:08:41,164 --> 00:08:43,066
- Wow. Beautiful place you have here.
- Thank you.

57
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:46,769
- Absolutely gorgeous.
- I just got a couple questions if you don't mind.

58
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:48,137
Yeah, of course.

59
00:08:48,204 --> 00:08:53,209
There are a couple of
question marks in your past.

60
00:08:53,643 --> 00:08:55,144
I recognize that.

61
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:58,815
You're the first face
people see

62
00:08:58,881 --> 00:09:01,117
when they walk
into my restaurant.

63
00:09:01,184 --> 00:09:02,952
And they'd be greeted
with a smile.

64
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:05,188
I have had some issues
in the past.

65
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:08,191
I did a full background check on
you, Mr. McCauley.

66
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:11,461
I spoke to some
of your past employers.

67
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:15,531
And you know what?
They all said the same thing.

68
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:18,167
I'm interested to hear
what they had to say.

69
00:09:18,234 --> 00:09:19,502
They say you're great!

70
00:09:19,569 --> 00:09:22,171
They say you're smart.
He's a smart guy.

71
00:09:22,238 --> 00:09:24,107
Smart guy right here, huh?

72
00:09:24,173 --> 00:09:28,111
That's all good. I guess I've got
the job then. When do I start?

73
00:09:28,177 --> 00:09:31,481
Tell me about the customer
you attacked.

74
00:09:31,547 --> 00:09:33,816
He assaulted a waitress.

75
00:09:33,883 --> 00:09:35,118
So you broke his arm.

76
00:09:35,184 --> 00:09:37,320
I did.
It was unintentional.

77
00:09:37,386 --> 00:09:40,823
Excuse me,
but he grabbed her ass.

78
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,825
I asked him to leave politely.

79
00:09:42,892 --> 00:09:46,496
He put his hands on me. No charges were
ever filed. Everything was dismissed.

80
00:09:46,562 --> 00:09:52,835
So you just walked out of a shift at
Locanda and you... you never came back?

81
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:54,971
I had a personal issue.
That was six years ago.

82
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:59,175
Yeah, your manager told me
that you were institutionalized.

83
00:09:59,242 --> 00:10:00,910
For two weeks.

84
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:04,413
Two weeks. Melanie, it's just two weeks.
Just two weeks.

85
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,518
Look. My struggles with mental
illness are a part of my past.

86
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:11,020
I haven't had so much
as an eye twitch since.

87
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:14,924
I think, if anything, getting through what
I've been through only makes me stronger.

88
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:20,062
And I am 100% confident
in my ability to manage here.

89
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:21,564
Thanks for coming in today,
Evan.

90
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:24,367
Please. Look, I know
what it looks like.

91
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:27,203
But my illness isn't an issue
you have to worry about.

92
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,473
- I promise you...
- Hey, we'll be in touch, okay?

93
00:10:34,944 --> 00:10:37,180
No, you won't.

94
00:10:37,613 --> 00:10:38,347
Excuse me?

95
00:10:38,414 --> 00:10:41,417
I know the brush-off
when I hear it.

96
00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:46,923
Mr. McCauley, you are clearly
awesome at dealing with conflict.

97
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:48,224
You have no idea.

98
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,059
Thanks for coming in.

99
00:10:50,126 --> 00:10:53,629
But you're right. I don't think
I will need to be calling you.

100
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:56,232
You think you know my story

101
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:57,567
because you ran
a background check

102
00:10:57,633 --> 00:10:59,569
and made a couple
of phone calls?

103
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:03,372
I knew yours when I shook
your well-moisturized hand.

104
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,508
Thank you for your time.

105
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:08,311
I get it. I do.

106
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:11,414
Who's going to hire a diagnosed
schizophrenic with a history of violence,

107
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,084
when there's a dozen candidates out
there with sparkling clean records?

108
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:19,922
But what's really on my mind is if I can't
get a job, I can't pay rent this month.

109
00:11:21,524 --> 00:11:24,527
I mean, dry-cleaning this suit
wasn't exactly free.

110
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:30,600
And more than that, I've gotta
get something together real quick,

111
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,135
because these meds,
they're running out.

112
00:11:33,202 --> 00:11:35,471
And once they do,
shit gets real.

113
00:11:56,525 --> 00:11:59,428
Are there things
you just know how to do?

114
00:12:01,397 --> 00:12:03,699
Like, no one's
ever showed you.

115
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:07,937
Somehow each step
in the process makes sense.

116
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,721
Like you're remembering it.

117
00:12:27,056 --> 00:12:28,457
Not learning it.

118
00:12:45,741 --> 00:12:48,344
For reals, you really
made that shit yourself, man?

119
00:12:48,411 --> 00:12:50,513
- Yep.
- Damn.

120
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:53,582
Hey, yo, Ronny.
Yo, Ronny.

121
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:55,885
- Evan, man.
- Hey.

122
00:12:57,286 --> 00:12:58,521
As requested.

123
00:12:58,587 --> 00:13:01,257
Kimotsuki-styled iron.
Handcrafted.

124
00:13:01,324 --> 00:13:02,591
One of a kind.

125
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,728
Oh, hell, yeah.

126
00:13:08,264 --> 00:13:11,033
Hattori Hanzo, yo? Ooh!

127
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,368
Damn.

128
00:13:12,435 --> 00:13:13,569
- Goddamn.
- Nice.

129
00:13:13,636 --> 00:13:15,104
Get off me.

130
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:17,606
Now, let's get this man paid.

131
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:19,575
You get high off this shit?

132
00:13:19,642 --> 00:13:22,044
No. Clozapine.
It's an antipsychotic.

133
00:13:22,111 --> 00:13:24,046
You get paid in pills?

134
00:13:24,113 --> 00:13:26,582
Evan here's on "Ronny-care."

135
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:28,517
Yeah. Dr. Ronny.

136
00:13:28,584 --> 00:13:31,053
Why don't you, like,
get them at Duane Reade?

137
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,589
Because Evan don't wanna talk to
shrinks every two weeks. Right?

138
00:13:33,656 --> 00:13:36,359
Yeah. Evan can't afford 400
bucks a month on a scrip.

139
00:13:36,425 --> 00:13:38,527
Yo. Wikipedia.

140
00:13:38,594 --> 00:13:42,365
- What's the capital of "Brakina Fatso"?
- Yeah.

141
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:46,235
It's pronounced "Burkina Faso." Ouagadougou.
Could I have my pills, please?

142
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:50,806
Shit, man.
Forgot my count, man.

143
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:52,541
You made that up.

144
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,545
Damn, man!

145
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,215
Nah.

146
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:03,119
Homeboy knows everything.
He a freak.

147
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:05,321
How do you know so much?

148
00:14:05,388 --> 00:14:08,624
Honestly, I wish I knew.
Makes me nuts.

149
00:14:08,691 --> 00:14:10,693
Could I have my pills, please.

150
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:18,534
Dang, girl. You eyeballin' my
boy like he a steak dinner.

151
00:14:19,335 --> 00:14:23,339
Yo, yo.
What's gunpowder made of?

152
00:14:23,406 --> 00:14:27,109
74% potassium nitrate,
13% charcoal.

153
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:30,279
- Okay.
- Damn. Impressive, man.

154
00:14:33,849 --> 00:14:35,718
I said eyes on me.

155
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:37,686
Come on, Ronny.

156
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:40,523
There you go, man.
Sixty packages.

157
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:42,525
That's only 55.

158
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:44,560
For real?

159
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:46,662
Close enough.

160
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:49,365
The hell it is.
I live on those.

161
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,134
Sixty. Hey.

162
00:14:52,201 --> 00:14:53,369
Hey.

163
00:14:53,436 --> 00:14:55,871
You want the real thing,
right? That is it.

164
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:59,141
That's folded over 70 times.
Carbon-treated steel.

165
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,810
Take your damn hands off me.

166
00:15:00,876 --> 00:15:03,546
You better tell your boy to learn how to count.

167
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,314
The deal is for 60 bags.

168
00:15:05,381 --> 00:15:08,484
Yeah?
Well, that's all we got.

169
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:11,887
You don't like it,
you can go back to Bellevue.

170
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:15,224
Get the gat on homeboy.

171
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,394
I wanna test this shit out.

172
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:25,668
Yo, what's gunpowder
made of?

173
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:26,902
Hold out your arm.

174
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:28,604
Showtime.

175
00:15:30,906 --> 00:15:32,708
Hold out your arm.

176
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:36,846
Get up.

177
00:15:36,912 --> 00:15:40,716
Put your arm there, huh?
It's the neck or arm, baby.

178
00:15:40,783 --> 00:15:42,885
You choose.

179
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,421
Hey, Ronny.
That's not a toy, bro.

180
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:46,755
Mind your business, Evan.

181
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:48,791
Come on, Ronny.
This ain't funny.

182
00:15:56,632 --> 00:15:59,435
Oh, God!
My fingers!

183
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,205
I think it works,
huh, Ronny?

184
00:16:03,272 --> 00:16:05,274
Cut my goddamn fingers off, man!

185
00:16:05,341 --> 00:16:08,911
You'll be all right. Hey, sweetheart,
why don't you head on home now.

186
00:16:08,978 --> 00:16:10,746
You're trippin', bro.

187
00:16:10,813 --> 00:16:13,282
You are done, homey.
You're a dead fool.

188
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:15,684
I don't know, Ronny.
You're talking to a guy

189
00:16:15,751 --> 00:16:17,853
who buys antipsychotic
medication from you.

190
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,890
I'm feeling a little
unbalanced right now.

191
00:16:20,956 --> 00:16:24,393
Maybe the best way to get the
voices in my head to stop talking

192
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,728
is to cut yours off.

193
00:16:25,794 --> 00:16:27,663
Do you think it would help?

194
00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:31,700
No. Don't fight.
Don't shoot. It's cool.

195
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:33,569
We're cool, man.
We're cool. All right?

196
00:16:33,636 --> 00:16:37,306
Hey, dickhead.
Grab my pills. Now.

197
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:38,641
There you go.

198
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,609
You're crazy, man.

199
00:16:40,676 --> 00:16:43,812
If I was crazy, I'd have chopped you
up in little pieces a long time ago.

200
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,314
Give me my pills.

201
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:48,918
Now, you listen to me, Ronny.
I'm not crazy, okay?

202
00:16:48,984 --> 00:16:52,121
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm just misunderstood. All right?

203
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,443
- Help!
- Leona!

204
00:17:51,046 --> 00:17:53,315
Oh!

205
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:26,715
NYPD picked up an Evan McCauley.
Drug deal gone south.

206
00:18:27,616 --> 00:18:29,885
Cops found a sword on him.

207
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:32,688
Blade was made with a process

208
00:18:32,755 --> 00:18:36,025
hasn't been used
since, uh, Edo Japan.

209
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:38,360
So?

210
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:40,763
He claims he forged it himself.

211
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:43,365
Another broker-turned-hipster
blacksmith.

212
00:18:43,432 --> 00:18:46,602
Oh, ye of little faith.
Are you seeing this, Nora?

213
00:18:47,436 --> 00:18:50,539
- Treadway?
- Precisely.

214
00:18:50,606 --> 00:18:53,909
If we know, Bathurst knows.

215
00:18:53,976 --> 00:18:56,011
Be careful.

216
00:18:56,078 --> 00:18:57,780
Thanks, Mom.

217
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,637
Tell us
when you're done, sir.

218
00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:23,772
Can I get my phone call?

219
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:27,443
Supposed to get
a phone call.

220
00:19:40,022 --> 00:19:44,026
You're dressed way too nice
to be an NYPD detective, so...

221
00:19:45,494 --> 00:19:46,829
must be a doctor.

222
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:50,165
Not a thing?

223
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,802
No recognition at all?

224
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:58,741
I think I should feel hurt.

225
00:20:00,843 --> 00:20:04,747
Do you remember... Syracuse?

226
00:20:04,813 --> 00:20:06,615
Syracuse.

227
00:20:06,682 --> 00:20:07,916
The siege.

228
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,919
Second Punic War.

229
00:20:12,521 --> 00:20:13,856
Where we first met.

230
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:16,992
Well, not quite the thrill ride
of the First Punic War,

231
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:19,495
but, hey,
sequels are tough, huh?

232
00:20:20,162 --> 00:20:21,497
You disappoint me.

233
00:20:21,563 --> 00:20:23,632
Well, join the club.

234
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:25,200
I notice...

235
00:20:26,835 --> 00:20:28,203
you didn't sign it.

236
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,208
Then again...

237
00:20:34,877 --> 00:20:37,112
craftsmanship like this...

238
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,550
you didn't need to, did you?

239
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:44,520
I made a sword.
Is that a crime?

240
00:20:45,854 --> 00:20:48,023
Evan McCauley.

241
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:52,227
Diagnosed with schizophrenia
at 14...

242
00:20:52,895 --> 00:20:56,064
after carving the words
"Look inside"

243
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:59,535
into your chest
with a box cutter.

244
00:21:00,068 --> 00:21:03,672
Electroshock proved unhelpful.

245
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:05,240
But these...

246
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:08,110
are not bad, eh?

247
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,584
- Doctor, can I...
- Please. Go ahead.

248
00:21:18,287 --> 00:21:22,758
At 16, attempted suicide
via car crash,

249
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:26,061
necessitating the steel plate
in your skull.

250
00:21:26,128 --> 00:21:29,031
Spent the rest
of your early life

251
00:21:29,097 --> 00:21:33,202
bouncing around between psych
hospitals and foster homes.

252
00:21:33,268 --> 00:21:35,537
Well, I only cut
a couple of his fingers off.

253
00:21:35,604 --> 00:21:38,774
I don't think I'm gonna need to plead
insanity on this one, am I, Doctor?

254
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:40,108
I'm curious.

255
00:21:41,276 --> 00:21:42,945
"Look inside."

256
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,849
- Why those words?
- Why not?

257
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:16,545
Which one of these...
is yours?

258
00:22:17,446 --> 00:22:20,582
You can skip the...
whatever the hell this is

259
00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:23,318
because none of that
is mine.

260
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:28,957
You're not supposed
to have that in here.

261
00:22:37,032 --> 00:22:38,567
What's going on here?

262
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:40,569
Hey, Officer.

263
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,857
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

264
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:08,997
Pick it up.

265
00:23:09,698 --> 00:23:10,866
What?

266
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,201
Pick it up.

267
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:20,175
Paris.

268
00:23:20,242 --> 00:23:22,077
1794.

269
00:23:22,844 --> 00:23:25,113
The last meal
of the Comte d'Anjou.

270
00:23:29,885 --> 00:23:31,086
A Bordeaux.

271
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,222
Not a bad choice
for a last meal.

272
00:23:35,357 --> 00:23:36,625
Was it yours?

273
00:23:38,393 --> 00:23:41,363
I wish I knew what you were talking
about, but I don't know what to tell...

274
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,831
Jesus!

275
00:23:42,898 --> 00:23:45,200
Every time you say,
"I don't know,"

276
00:23:45,734 --> 00:23:48,303
this trigger
gets pulled.

277
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:54,843
- Is it yours?
- I don't know...

278
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,712
Are you out of your mind?

279
00:23:56,778 --> 00:23:59,014
- We're in a police station! Hello! Officer!
- The room is soundproof!

280
00:23:59,081 --> 00:24:04,419
They won't even hear it when I put 250 grams
of lead through the back of your skull.

281
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:13,195
- Is it yours?
- Yes. Okay, yes, it's mine.

282
00:24:13,261 --> 00:24:14,696
Are you happy?

283
00:24:14,763 --> 00:24:15,931
Jesus!

284
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:20,102
Lying... won't help.

285
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:25,340
Look. I'm just a guy who was at the wrong
place at the wrong time. That's all.

286
00:24:25,407 --> 00:24:27,109
Last chance, Evan.

287
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:32,280
Is... it... yours?

288
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:14,456
There's the Treadway I know!

289
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:26,334
Little trick I learned from you.

290
00:25:29,971 --> 00:25:31,506
Hello, old friend.

291
00:25:53,862 --> 00:25:55,197
Whoa!

292
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,235
Get in!

293
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:14,950
- Hold on.
- Shit!

294
00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:35,403
Go! Turn! Turn!

295
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:50,085
Oh, shit!

296
00:26:52,621 --> 00:26:54,422
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

297
00:26:56,057 --> 00:26:57,125
Go! Go!

298
00:27:02,097 --> 00:27:04,166
Inside!

299
00:27:04,232 --> 00:27:06,468
- Hold tight.
- Oh, sh...

300
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:18,580
Cover!

301
00:27:20,315 --> 00:27:22,417
What are you waiting for?
Come on, let's go!

302
00:27:22,484 --> 00:27:24,386
- Go the other way!
- Take the wheel.

303
00:27:24,452 --> 00:27:26,254
- What?
- Get out of the car!

304
00:27:26,321 --> 00:27:29,457
Yeah, sure. Retractable steering wheel.
No problem. That's normal.

305
00:27:32,427 --> 00:27:35,030
- Reverse.
- Shoot that son of a bitch.

306
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:43,071
Move! Clear the street!

307
00:27:43,138 --> 00:27:45,140
Shoot the driver!

308
00:27:49,644 --> 00:27:51,279
Jesus Christ!

309
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,152
Who are they?

310
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:02,557
Relax, it's bulletproof.

311
00:28:06,228 --> 00:28:07,662
180 now!

312
00:28:25,013 --> 00:28:26,181
Don't stop.

313
00:29:10,692 --> 00:29:12,360
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, sure.

314
00:29:12,427 --> 00:29:13,695
Who the hell are you?

315
00:29:13,762 --> 00:29:15,330
I'm Nora Brightman.

316
00:29:15,397 --> 00:29:17,666
Okay. But who was
that dude back there?

317
00:29:17,732 --> 00:29:20,201
Bathurst.
You didn't recognize him?

318
00:29:20,268 --> 00:29:22,370
No, I didn't.
But clearly you did.

319
00:29:22,437 --> 00:29:24,339
Well, you've known him
a long time.

320
00:29:24,406 --> 00:29:27,409
I've never seen that man before in my life.
Him, I think I'd remember.

321
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:29,511
Well, not in this life,
maybe.

322
00:29:29,577 --> 00:29:31,680
Oh, no. Maybe I bumped into him
during the Second Punic War?

323
00:29:31,746 --> 00:29:34,182
Or maybe it was the French Revolution.
I'm bad with dates.

324
00:29:34,249 --> 00:29:37,352
- You remember that?
- No. I don't remember the French Revolution.

325
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:40,088
I figured it out.
I see now. I get it.

326
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:42,357
- You do?
- None of this is real.

327
00:29:42,424 --> 00:29:44,225
It's a psychotic break.

328
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:46,695
I'm gonna wake up in a hospital
somewhere, drooling all over myself,

329
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:48,763
- strung out on lithium.
- Is that easier to believe

330
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,166
than the idea that maybe destiny
has something more in store for you?

331
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,536
Destiny? Where I come from,
we got bills to pay, rent to make.

332
00:29:54,602 --> 00:29:57,405
- Nobody's got time for destiny.
- That's a shame.

333
00:30:13,121 --> 00:30:15,557
I know you've been
looking for answers, Evan.

334
00:30:15,623 --> 00:30:17,792
But you're not crazy.
You never have been.

335
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:20,762
No, I'm not crazy.
I'm just delusional.

336
00:30:20,829 --> 00:30:23,398
Do you ever find yourself drawn
to places you've never been?

337
00:30:23,465 --> 00:30:26,401
Do you ever see a picture of a place
and just know you've been there?

338
00:30:26,468 --> 00:30:27,635
Do you know things
you shouldn't?

339
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:29,738
Do you pick up things fast,
almost as if

340
00:30:29,804 --> 00:30:32,574
you're remembering skills,
not learning them?

341
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,609
I've told
a dozen therapists this.

342
00:30:34,676 --> 00:30:37,245
I've been analyzed every way
possible, a hundred times over.

343
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,580
It doesn't mean anything.

344
00:30:38,646 --> 00:30:41,082
Do you dream
in other languages?

345
00:30:44,352 --> 00:30:47,489
That's what schizophrenia is.
Different people, same head.

346
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:51,126
What if it were the same
person, different lives?

347
00:30:51,192 --> 00:30:54,095
- You're talking about reincarnation.
- Yeah.

348
00:30:54,162 --> 00:30:56,631
You can forge a sword because
you were a blacksmith.

349
00:30:56,698 --> 00:30:59,634
You speak Russian
because you were Russian.

350
00:30:59,701 --> 00:31:01,436
Look, I hate to break it to you.

351
00:31:01,503 --> 00:31:04,506
It's a comforting idea,
souls moving from one body to the next.

352
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:08,443
But it's basically just a spiritual
equivalent of "better luck next time." Okay?

353
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,278
Nothing more and nothing less.

354
00:31:10,345 --> 00:31:13,281
- Feel safe warm and inside all that cynicism?
- I do, actually.

355
00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:15,617
- And how's that working out for you?
- In the grand scheme of things?

356
00:31:15,683 --> 00:31:17,519
Like big-picture shit?
Not so great.

357
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:19,687
But I'm good. I'm surviving.

358
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:25,326
The visions you've had your entire
life, Evan, aren't hallucinations.

359
00:31:25,393 --> 00:31:26,728
They're memories.

360
00:31:27,562 --> 00:31:30,465
So, you're saying that a
hundred doctors were wrong?

361
00:31:30,532 --> 00:31:35,437
Fifty medications didn't work because I'm
really a reincarnated Russian blacksmith?

362
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,372
This is real.

363
00:31:38,206 --> 00:31:40,141
I'm real.

364
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:43,545
Oh, yeah? This is no version of
reincarnation I've ever heard of.

365
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:44,879
Buddhist, Hindu, Sikh.

366
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:47,715
They believe each life begins
with a clean slate.

367
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:50,785
The answers you've been
looking for all your life...

368
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:54,889
all you gotta do
is get on that plane.

369
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:00,462
You know what I'm really
asking myself right now is?

370
00:32:00,528 --> 00:32:03,832
What if the craziest thing I've ever
heard... and this is some crazy shit...

371
00:32:03,898 --> 00:32:06,701
is actually the first thing that's
ever made any goddamn sense?

372
00:32:09,404 --> 00:32:13,608
I don't gotta go feed the cat,
so... let's go.

373
00:32:40,802 --> 00:32:42,237
Go on.

374
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:05,960
They left
from a private airport.

375
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:07,962
It was an unlisted flight.

376
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:10,965
She was there fast.

377
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,469
Too fast.

378
00:33:14,536 --> 00:33:18,273
The sword hadn't been in the
system for more than a few hours.

379
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:20,808
- Then they have a base here in New York.
- I want it found.

380
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:24,412
It will lead us
to Evan McCauley.

381
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:26,414
He will lead us
to the Egg.

382
00:33:26,481 --> 00:33:27,982
Again.

383
00:33:48,536 --> 00:33:50,672
We call ourselves
the Infinite.

384
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:53,341
Less than 500 souls
from across the globe,

385
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:57,612
all born with the ability
to remember all our past lives

386
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,481
and the skills we've learned
in each of them.

387
00:34:00,548 --> 00:34:02,317
There are two groups
within the Infinites:

388
00:34:02,383 --> 00:34:07,288
Bathurst and the Nihilists,
who just want the world to end,

389
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:09,724
and us... the Believers.

390
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:11,960
And what is it
that we believe?

391
00:34:12,026 --> 00:34:15,763
We believe that our gift
is a responsibility.

392
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:18,600
That it's up to us
to leave humanity

393
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:21,369
- better off than we found it.
- Yeah.

394
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:24,706
I think
I'm gonna need these.

395
00:34:57,538 --> 00:34:59,841
- Hey.
- Hey.

396
00:34:59,907 --> 00:35:00,942
Thanks.

397
00:35:02,944 --> 00:35:05,380
Wow. It's a long way
from Arthur Avenue.

398
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:08,916
It always blows
my mind.

399
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:11,986
We call it the Hub.

400
00:35:16,758 --> 00:35:19,827
This is the place where you're
gonna get your memories back, Evan.

401
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,798
We'll be landing soon.

402
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:43,117
- Recognize anything?
- I'm pretty sure I'd remember this.

403
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:45,853
It used to be dedicated
to scientific research.

404
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,056
Anthropology and linguistics.

405
00:35:48,122 --> 00:35:50,425
All of us using
what we've learned.

406
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:53,728
Life after life for the
advancement of mankind.

407
00:35:53,795 --> 00:35:55,129
And what is it now?

408
00:35:55,963 --> 00:35:59,133
Headquarters for the
losing side in the war.

409
00:36:03,771 --> 00:36:06,074
Bathurst is the master
of combat.

410
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,709
Hundreds of lifetimes.

411
00:36:16,017 --> 00:36:18,152
You must be prepared
for everything.

412
00:36:26,694 --> 00:36:28,730
He's the apex predator
in our world.

413
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:33,034
Again.

414
00:36:41,843 --> 00:36:43,177
Why are they bowing?

415
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:45,847
They're hoping
you're Heinrich Treadway.

416
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:47,982
- Again!
- Reincarnated.

417
00:36:48,049 --> 00:36:49,817
"Heinrich"?

418
00:36:49,884 --> 00:36:52,120
It was a popular name
in the '50s.

419
00:36:52,186 --> 00:36:53,287
In the '50s.

420
00:36:53,354 --> 00:36:57,091
Great for rock 'n' roll,
but lousy for names, I guess.

421
00:36:57,158 --> 00:36:59,460
The 1750s.

422
00:37:02,196 --> 00:37:04,932
What do I know
that you need so bad?

423
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:07,935
That's why you're here...
to find out.

424
00:37:31,058 --> 00:37:35,029
- This is Treadway's room.
- Are you asking me or telling me?

425
00:37:35,096 --> 00:37:38,533
I must've really screwed up
on my last incarnation.

426
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,034
Why would you say that?

427
00:37:40,701 --> 00:37:43,070
Have you seen where I live
in this life?

428
00:37:49,076 --> 00:37:52,046
That's Treadway's
Himalaya diary.

429
00:37:55,883 --> 00:37:57,752
That was me.

430
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:00,221
When I was Leona Warrick.

431
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:04,091
And that was Treadway.

432
00:38:11,766 --> 00:38:13,768
Two days after that picture
was taken,

433
00:38:13,835 --> 00:38:15,770
Treadway saved my life.

434
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:19,774
There's a reason
you picked that book.

435
00:38:20,441 --> 00:38:23,010
All this tells me
is what he did.

436
00:38:23,077 --> 00:38:25,046
None of it tells me
who he was.

437
00:38:25,112 --> 00:38:28,015
Here we can study
anything and everything.

438
00:38:28,082 --> 00:38:31,619
Space, time, scale.
It's all relevant.

439
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:34,222
That doesn't seem
like much.

440
00:38:34,288 --> 00:38:36,724
Welcome to my virtual sandbox.

441
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:38,593
- Name's Garrick.
- Hi.

442
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:40,962
Garrick is our head
of technology and research.

443
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:43,097
He doesn't
look like much.

444
00:38:43,764 --> 00:38:45,933
Goddamn, it's good
to see you again.

445
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,569
It's nice to meet you too.

446
00:38:48,636 --> 00:38:52,206
Don't worry.
All this shit, it just gets weirder.

447
00:38:52,273 --> 00:38:53,708
Okay.

448
00:38:53,774 --> 00:38:55,076
Now let's get started.

449
00:38:55,142 --> 00:38:56,143
Follow me.

450
00:38:59,714 --> 00:39:01,315
Stand there for me,
please.

451
00:39:02,116 --> 00:39:03,150
Okay.

452
00:39:20,001 --> 00:39:22,103
That's the guy
from the police station.

453
00:39:22,169 --> 00:39:25,339
Bathurst.
He and Treadway were once friends.

454
00:39:25,873 --> 00:39:27,842
A dozen lifetimes.
Wars, peace.

455
00:39:27,909 --> 00:39:31,579
They stood together at some of the
greatest moments in human history.

456
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,115
Then Bathurst lost faith.

457
00:39:34,181 --> 00:39:38,152
For the last 300 years,
he's been looking for a way out.

458
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:40,988
He needed a way
to stop reincarnating.

459
00:39:41,055 --> 00:39:42,924
He wants it all to end.

460
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:45,326
That's why he made this.

461
00:40:15,423 --> 00:40:20,094
The Egg, designed to
kill every living thing on earth.

462
00:40:20,728 --> 00:40:23,197
That seems a little drastic.

463
00:40:23,264 --> 00:40:25,299
If there's nothing left alive,

464
00:40:25,366 --> 00:40:28,302
there's nothing left
to reincarnate into.

465
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:34,976
It attacks life
at the source... DNA...

466
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:37,678
unwinding the very fabric
of existence.

467
00:40:37,745 --> 00:40:41,749
Every plant, every animal
every person.

468
00:40:41,816 --> 00:40:42,850
Mama!

469
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:44,685
Jordan!

470
00:40:47,755 --> 00:40:49,123
I'm coming!

471
00:40:55,896 --> 00:40:57,398
Like unplugging a computer

472
00:40:57,465 --> 00:40:59,233
when a program freezes.

473
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,068
Only when he pulls this plug,

474
00:41:01,135 --> 00:41:03,671
seven billion people
will go with him.

475
00:41:05,106 --> 00:41:07,942
Everything it kills
accelerates the process.

476
00:41:12,246 --> 00:41:16,017
God! Holy shit,
that felt freakin' real!

477
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:18,953
Without you, none of us
would be here right now.

478
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,221
What are you
talking about?

479
00:41:20,287 --> 00:41:23,024
Last cycle,
you raided Bathurst's lab,

480
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:26,293
stole the Egg, killed his Einstein
and everyone who helped build it,

481
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,396
leaving him with no way
to recreate it.

482
00:41:28,462 --> 00:41:32,066
You took the secret of the
Egg's whereabouts to your grave.

483
00:41:32,133 --> 00:41:35,036
Bathurst spent this entire
lifetime looking for it.

484
00:41:35,102 --> 00:41:38,406
And he's getting closer and
closer to finding it every day.

485
00:41:38,472 --> 00:41:40,741
That's why he tracked
you down in New York.

486
00:41:40,808 --> 00:41:43,244
So I get on the plane,
you get all my memories back,

487
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,312
and I save the whole entire world, right?
That's it?

488
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:46,914
That's pretty much
basically it, right?

489
00:41:46,981 --> 00:41:48,883
Told you it was
gonna get weird.

490
00:41:48,949 --> 00:41:50,284
So, what now?

491
00:41:53,821 --> 00:41:55,823
Tell me good news, Nora.

492
00:41:55,890 --> 00:42:00,061
Bryan Porter.
Treadway had a gift with steel, didn't he?

493
00:42:00,127 --> 00:42:04,498
Impeccable. Your friends in the NYPD
were certainly impressed with it.

494
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:09,003
Unfortunately, their encryption
skills are less than impeccable.

495
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,472
Led us right to you.

496
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:25,352
You do know we have easier ways
of doing things now, right?

497
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,221
Newer...

498
00:42:28,055 --> 00:42:30,524
almost never means better.

499
00:42:39,533 --> 00:42:43,104
We're going to uncover
Evan McCauley's location.

500
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,372
We'll brute-force
your encryption.

501
00:42:46,574 --> 00:42:50,377
But I'd consider it...
a courtesy...

502
00:42:51,412 --> 00:42:52,446
if you just...

503
00:42:54,014 --> 00:42:55,449
sped the process up.

504
00:42:58,385 --> 00:43:00,287
Tell us where he is.

505
00:43:08,262 --> 00:43:10,564
Okay.

506
00:43:12,066 --> 00:43:13,567
I know where he is.

507
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:17,805
Of course I do.

508
00:43:18,439 --> 00:43:22,243
I know exactly where he is.
I just...

509
00:43:25,212 --> 00:43:27,014
I, um...

510
00:43:27,081 --> 00:43:31,152
I sometimes have difficulties...

511
00:43:31,218 --> 00:43:32,920
with my memory.

512
00:43:32,987 --> 00:43:34,088
Memory.

513
00:43:34,155 --> 00:43:35,856
I remember

514
00:43:35,923 --> 00:43:38,159
when you used to
gather honey

515
00:43:38,225 --> 00:43:40,394
on the fields
of Marathon.

516
00:43:41,595 --> 00:43:46,467
Just another reminder of
how nothing stays the same.

517
00:43:56,443 --> 00:43:58,312
Would you care
for some?

518
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,553
You know what
real torture is?

519
00:44:05,619 --> 00:44:07,121
Listening to you?

520
00:44:07,188 --> 00:44:12,226
Real torture...
isn't physical pain,

521
00:44:12,293 --> 00:44:15,095
but human stupidity.

522
00:44:15,162 --> 00:44:18,532
Being surrounded by it,
engulfed in it.

523
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:21,368
Lifetime after lifetime.

524
00:44:21,435 --> 00:44:25,239
People with their idiot grins!

525
00:44:25,306 --> 00:44:27,908
Their infuriating
pleasantries!

526
00:44:27,975 --> 00:44:29,944
Their need for approval!

527
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:33,614
Their unctuous attempts
to be loved and validated!

528
00:44:33,681 --> 00:44:37,418
They are walking,
talking obituaries...

529
00:44:37,484 --> 00:44:40,588
...on the back page of a dying newspaper,

530
00:44:40,654 --> 00:44:44,592
at the bottom of a birdcage,
in the corner of a filthy living room

531
00:44:44,658 --> 00:44:45,593
of a hoarder cat lady!

532
00:44:45,659 --> 00:44:48,596
- And we are forced...
- You'll never understand...

533
00:44:48,662 --> 00:44:52,066
- ...to live amongst them over...
- ...friendship, love.

534
00:44:52,132 --> 00:44:53,634
...and over endlessly.

535
00:44:53,701 --> 00:44:56,170
- That is the true...
- You still don't understand about faith!

536
00:44:56,237 --> 00:44:57,938
...definition of torture.

537
00:44:58,005 --> 00:45:01,342
Faith! Blah, blah, blah!

538
00:45:01,408 --> 00:45:02,576
Faith!

539
00:45:03,677 --> 00:45:04,912
Faith.

540
00:45:06,347 --> 00:45:08,949
I'm tired of faith.

541
00:45:09,016 --> 00:45:12,553
God must show me
his face.

542
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,670
But thank you...
for enlightening me.

543
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:49,323
You kept
his fucking body?

544
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:50,691
Sexy son of a bitch,
isn't he?

545
00:45:50,758 --> 00:45:52,660
No. He's a dead guy
floating in water.

546
00:45:52,726 --> 00:45:54,662
That's pretty much
my worst nightmare.

547
00:45:54,728 --> 00:45:57,564
Actually, it's a crotonic acid matrix.
Keeps the cells alive.

548
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,700
Oh. That makes it that much better.
Thank you.

549
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:03,237
We're trying to understand
the science behind what we are.

550
00:46:10,077 --> 00:46:14,415
Treadway believed that humans are
capable of so much more than we realized.

551
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:17,484
Is this what you're telling me?
I'm not living up to my potential?

552
00:46:17,551 --> 00:46:19,520
I've heard that speech before.

553
00:46:19,586 --> 00:46:23,757
Treadway pushed past boundaries
others might call paranormal, superhuman.

554
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:26,694
He can manipulate the energy
of the world around him.

555
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,495
I don't even know
what that means.

556
00:46:28,562 --> 00:46:30,397
What it means
is you'll have skills

557
00:46:30,464 --> 00:46:33,200
beyond anything
you've ever imagined.

558
00:46:33,267 --> 00:46:35,436
Those abilities
are very deep.

559
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:37,538
Below the conscious level.

560
00:46:37,604 --> 00:46:41,108
I'm down.
How do we get them back?

561
00:46:42,676 --> 00:46:45,212
Here,
we retrain your memory.

562
00:46:45,279 --> 00:46:49,083
We combine the physical and the
mental to develop new neural pathways.

563
00:46:57,458 --> 00:46:59,660
Memories are held
in every organ...

564
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:02,429
every cell in your body.

565
00:47:11,138 --> 00:47:14,808
Regression takes the kind of
concentration it takes years to develop.

566
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:16,510
This is a shortcut.

567
00:47:17,311 --> 00:47:20,814
We shock your mind
into synching with the system.

568
00:47:52,413 --> 00:47:57,584
It's working. I'm seeing increased
activity in all his memory centers.

569
00:48:30,284 --> 00:48:31,518
Hey!

570
00:48:48,302 --> 00:48:50,771
Come on.

571
00:48:52,539 --> 00:48:54,842
- That's not Treadway.
- Really?

572
00:48:54,908 --> 00:48:56,410
He just beat you.

573
00:48:56,477 --> 00:48:58,645
Treadway would've killed me.

574
00:49:05,552 --> 00:49:10,257
Wow. She wasn't kidding
about being at war, huh?

575
00:49:10,324 --> 00:49:12,759
Improving
the human condition.

576
00:49:12,826 --> 00:49:16,230
Sometimes you do it by
painting a chapel ceiling.

577
00:49:16,296 --> 00:49:18,599
Yeah. And sometimes you
drop them from a mile out.

578
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:20,767
Don't touch that.

579
00:49:20,834 --> 00:49:22,569
Okay, okay.

580
00:49:25,772 --> 00:49:28,375
That's no gun
I've ever seen before.

581
00:49:28,442 --> 00:49:31,879
We're reverse-engineering
Bathurst's Dethroner.

582
00:49:31,945 --> 00:49:36,416
A Dethroner? I mean, dude,
who's coming up with these names?

583
00:49:36,483 --> 00:49:37,684
Look...

584
00:49:38,485 --> 00:49:41,355
you can't kill an Infinite.
You kill the body, but...

585
00:49:41,421 --> 00:49:44,291
- And they get reincarnated?
- Yeah.

586
00:49:45,459 --> 00:49:48,729
This implants in your head

587
00:49:48,795 --> 00:49:51,598
and pulls out
your consciousness...

588
00:49:52,666 --> 00:49:55,569
your soul,
and onto a digital chip.

589
00:49:55,636 --> 00:49:58,205
Your soul gets stuck on a disk
and breaks the cycle.

590
00:49:59,873 --> 00:50:02,943
Over 200 of our brothers
and sisters are lost

591
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:05,312
in that digital purgatory.

592
00:50:05,979 --> 00:50:08,649
You come
face to face with this,

593
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:12,986
my advice... find a way to
die the old-fashioned way.

594
00:50:16,523 --> 00:50:18,125
Come in.

595
00:50:22,496 --> 00:50:24,264
Okay if I look around?

596
00:50:24,331 --> 00:50:25,999
Be my guest.

597
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:47,688
These are all you,
aren't they?

598
00:50:48,655 --> 00:50:50,757
They're people I once was.

599
00:50:52,025 --> 00:50:53,560
All of them.

600
00:50:56,096 --> 00:50:57,631
Wow.

601
00:50:57,698 --> 00:51:00,267
That's cool.
You look happy.

602
00:51:01,568 --> 00:51:03,036
I was.

603
00:51:04,371 --> 00:51:05,772
Who's that guy?

604
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,709
In that picture,
he was Abel.

605
00:51:09,443 --> 00:51:14,448
Before then,
other names, other faces.

606
00:51:14,514 --> 00:51:16,016
But the soul...

607
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:18,819
the soul was always him.

608
00:51:18,885 --> 00:51:21,955
So, what? You loved each
other through multiple lives?

609
00:51:22,589 --> 00:51:24,858
These are all
the same place.

610
00:51:24,925 --> 00:51:28,295
Angkor Wat.
What we call the Beginning.

611
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:33,367
I'll find you in the Beginning.

612
00:51:33,433 --> 00:51:34,801
I love you.

613
00:51:34,868 --> 00:51:38,405
When each of us would find
ourselves in a new life,

614
00:51:38,472 --> 00:51:39,906
this is where
Abel and I would go.

615
00:51:39,973 --> 00:51:42,743
You're reincarnated.
How would you know where to go?

616
00:51:43,477 --> 00:51:47,514
Most of us have a reawakening
that begins young.

617
00:51:47,581 --> 00:51:50,017
Starts with small things,
memories,

618
00:51:50,083 --> 00:51:52,719
feelings about a place,
dreams.

619
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:54,855
By puberty,

620
00:51:54,921 --> 00:51:56,890
most Infinites
have full recall.

621
00:51:56,957 --> 00:52:01,094
Right around the time
they diagnosed me schizophrenic.

622
00:52:01,962 --> 00:52:04,665
So what happened if you died
young and got separated?

623
00:52:04,731 --> 00:52:06,600
For an Infinite...

624
00:52:07,634 --> 00:52:09,770
death isn't the end,
it's like...

625
00:52:10,304 --> 00:52:12,706
turning the page in a book.

626
00:52:12,773 --> 00:52:15,742
Next chapter, same story.

627
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:18,045
That's crazy.

628
00:52:18,111 --> 00:52:21,648
New lives, new bodies,
always meeting back at the same place.

629
00:52:24,451 --> 00:52:25,619
He was Dethroned.

630
00:52:28,021 --> 00:52:30,657
He's trapped on a
computer somewhere.

631
00:52:31,425 --> 00:52:35,128
My last life,
I got my memories back...

632
00:52:36,763 --> 00:52:38,699
and realized he was gone.

633
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,009
It's not my memories
that matter, Evan.

634
00:52:50,777 --> 00:52:51,945
It's yours.

635
00:52:58,685 --> 00:53:01,655
Your last life,
in Mexico...

636
00:53:02,289 --> 00:53:04,658
where did you hide the Egg?

637
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,181
Where's the Egg?

638
00:53:37,724 --> 00:53:39,826
Where is it?

639
00:53:49,035 --> 00:53:50,537
- He's spiking.
- Shut it down.

640
00:53:54,608 --> 00:53:55,809
Hey, you're okay.

641
00:53:55,876 --> 00:53:58,478
You're okay. Hey.
Hey, just breathe.

642
00:53:58,545 --> 00:53:59,679
- I need to get up.
- Breathe.

643
00:53:59,746 --> 00:54:01,148
Kovic, check his vitals.

644
00:54:01,214 --> 00:54:03,183
What happened in there, Evan?
What did you see?

645
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:05,986
Your neural network fired off
like the Fourth of July.

646
00:54:06,052 --> 00:54:09,623
I've been seeing this stuff all my life.
It still doesn't make any sense.

647
00:54:09,689 --> 00:54:10,891
Why can't he
remember anything?

648
00:54:10,957 --> 00:54:12,626
Between the car accident,
the electroshock

649
00:54:12,692 --> 00:54:15,862
and the steel plate in his head,
his mind is fractured.

650
00:54:15,929 --> 00:54:17,864
Something in there
won't let the memories flow.

651
00:54:17,931 --> 00:54:22,969
I can't get them out.
I'm afraid the Artisan is our last hope.

652
00:54:29,242 --> 00:54:31,778
He'll achieve recall soon.

653
00:54:33,647 --> 00:54:35,215
If he hasn't already.

654
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:46,026
Hundreds of lifetimes,

655
00:54:46,092 --> 00:54:48,995
and it all comes down
to these few hours.

656
00:54:51,097 --> 00:54:53,266
If we don't find him...

657
00:54:55,235 --> 00:54:58,171
before he gets
his memories back...

658
00:54:58,972 --> 00:55:00,807
we lose the Egg...

659
00:55:02,175 --> 00:55:03,276
forever.

660
00:55:05,612 --> 00:55:07,214
The wheels keep turning

661
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,150
and we can never...

662
00:55:11,918 --> 00:55:13,820
escape.

663
00:55:17,924 --> 00:55:19,993
We go at dawn.

664
00:56:12,712 --> 00:56:14,814
It's been a while, Otto.

665
00:56:14,881 --> 00:56:20,020
No one's called me by that name in...
so many lifetimes.

666
00:56:28,995 --> 00:56:30,997
Hello, my love.

667
00:56:32,365 --> 00:56:34,067
What happened to you?

668
00:56:35,435 --> 00:56:38,004
You were so beautiful.

669
00:56:38,872 --> 00:56:40,240
As were you.

670
00:56:40,674 --> 00:56:42,642
You don't miss it...

671
00:56:42,709 --> 00:56:44,244
the agility...

672
00:56:45,045 --> 00:56:46,246
the vibrancy...

673
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,949
being confined to this?

674
00:56:49,015 --> 00:56:52,218
You see me as something broken.
I don't.

675
00:56:53,186 --> 00:56:55,822
You're the cripple, Otto.

676
00:56:55,889 --> 00:56:58,058
- Crippled by your cowardice.
- Cowardice?

677
00:56:58,124 --> 00:57:03,163
No. I'm crippled
by my memory.

678
00:57:03,229 --> 00:57:07,167
You get your memories back
over years. Not me.

679
00:57:07,233 --> 00:57:11,338
I get it all back as my brain forms.
In the womb.

680
00:57:11,404 --> 00:57:16,876
Endless hours,
days, weeks, months.

681
00:57:16,943 --> 00:57:18,178
No room to move!

682
00:57:18,244 --> 00:57:20,847
Nothing
for my brain to do

683
00:57:20,914 --> 00:57:23,149
but eat itself.

684
00:57:23,216 --> 00:57:26,886
All these lifetimes,
the magnitude of this gift,

685
00:57:26,953 --> 00:57:29,356
and you haven't
learned a thing.

686
00:57:29,422 --> 00:57:31,091
I have to get out.

687
00:57:32,058 --> 00:57:33,727
I have to make it stop.

688
00:57:34,427 --> 00:57:38,264
Don't do it.
Don't give him anything.

689
00:57:39,466 --> 00:57:41,101
Where is Treadway?

690
00:57:47,941 --> 00:57:49,909
We storming the beach
at Normandy?

691
00:57:49,976 --> 00:57:52,178
You never know
with the Artisan.

692
00:57:53,113 --> 00:57:54,447
Let's get ready.

693
00:58:29,983 --> 00:58:31,151
Color out, please.

694
00:58:34,888 --> 00:58:36,990
So, the Artisan's
a gambler?

695
00:58:37,057 --> 00:58:38,425
No, he's a hedonist.

696
00:58:38,491 --> 00:58:41,961
Infinite lies,
infinite opportunity for debauchery.

697
00:58:42,028 --> 00:58:43,997
Sounds like
my kinda guy.

698
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:40,220
Alexa, music off.

699
00:59:40,286 --> 00:59:42,956
Get him cleaned up
and outta here.

700
00:59:43,022 --> 00:59:45,125
You're operating
on dead guys now?

701
00:59:45,191 --> 00:59:47,494
Da Vinci used to
cut into human cadavers

702
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,830
so that he could better
understand the human form.

703
00:59:50,897 --> 00:59:54,167
For me, I'm all about
that brain, baby.

704
00:59:54,234 --> 00:59:58,371
But you
know that all too well.

705
00:59:58,438 --> 01:00:03,176
Oh, what a beautiful cranial
arch you got this time around.

706
01:00:03,243 --> 01:00:07,514
I could better examine it if I
severed your head from your neck.

707
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:10,016
Like Treadway did to me
when last we met.

708
01:00:10,083 --> 01:00:12,018
- Try it.
- Oh.

709
01:00:12,085 --> 01:00:14,220
Bathurst took the Hub.

710
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:19,159
- Does he have the Egg?
- No.

711
01:00:19,225 --> 01:00:21,461
Think we'd be here
if he did?

712
01:00:22,929 --> 01:00:26,266
Wherever it is,
it's still in his head.

713
01:00:28,101 --> 01:00:29,068
Treadway?

714
01:00:29,135 --> 01:00:31,404
So they say.

715
01:00:33,106 --> 01:00:35,175
Wait. Is he blocked?

716
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:39,913
Well, well, well,
look at this.

717
01:00:39,979 --> 01:00:41,147
Huh.

718
01:00:41,848 --> 01:00:45,418
So, your hard drive
got fragged,

719
01:00:45,485 --> 01:00:48,555
which means we're gonna
have to reset your memory.

720
01:00:48,621 --> 01:00:53,626
And, Heinrich, I gotta tell ya,
I'm really gonna enjoy this.

721
01:00:54,027 --> 01:00:56,229
Ooh!

722
01:00:56,296 --> 01:00:57,964
Check this out.

723
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,436
You're all familiar with
the idea that when you die,

724
01:01:03,503 --> 01:01:06,606
your life flashes
before your eyes, right?

725
01:01:06,673 --> 01:01:10,076
This machine
enhances that experience,

726
01:01:10,143 --> 01:01:12,278
prolonging
your sense of time,

727
01:01:12,345 --> 01:01:17,383
allowing you to restore or
reorder everything inside.

728
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:24,424
This... This right here is the closest
you're gonna get to a total mental reboot.

729
01:01:25,325 --> 01:01:27,093
Are you planning
on trying to drown me?

730
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,428
'Cause I got a thing
about drowning.

731
01:01:28,494 --> 01:01:30,597
- Which is?
- I don't like it!

732
01:01:30,663 --> 01:01:33,933
What kind of success rate is
this guy working with, anyway?

733
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,336
Confidence is... high.

734
01:01:36,402 --> 01:01:39,239
Yeah, and so are you,
obviously.

735
01:01:39,305 --> 01:01:41,007
Okay. Hey.

736
01:01:41,074 --> 01:01:43,343
I like you this time around.
You're actually funny.

737
01:01:43,409 --> 01:01:48,081
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you're usually kind of a jerk.

738
01:01:48,147 --> 01:01:49,582
- It's true.
- Yeah, she gets it.

739
01:01:49,649 --> 01:01:51,651
So, I'm supposed
to trust this guy?

740
01:01:51,718 --> 01:01:53,486
- I wouldn't.
- First,

741
01:01:53,553 --> 01:01:55,321
I resent
the gender labeling.

742
01:01:55,388 --> 01:01:58,625
Second, you can trust
that we share the same goal.

743
01:01:58,691 --> 01:01:59,859
Really? Which is?

744
01:01:59,926 --> 01:02:03,997
Bathurst wants to what,
destroy every living thing on Earth?

745
01:02:04,063 --> 01:02:07,634
Well, that's gonna ruin a pretty
great party I've got goin' on here.

746
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,936
This guy's out of his mind.
Hey...

747
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:14,040
- There's a reason you didn't bring me here before.
- Mmm.

748
01:02:14,107 --> 01:02:16,576
- I could die in there.
- Yeah.

749
01:02:18,211 --> 01:02:19,579
Could it work?

750
01:02:21,581 --> 01:02:22,715
It could.

751
01:02:24,217 --> 01:02:26,519
But you have a choice,
Evan.

752
01:02:26,586 --> 01:02:28,955
No, I don't have a choice.

753
01:02:29,589 --> 01:02:32,058
I... I can't let
anybody else get hurt

754
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:33,960
because of what's in my head.

755
01:02:43,269 --> 01:02:45,571
All right.
Leap-of-faith time.

756
01:02:46,572 --> 01:02:49,342
Let's just do it now before
I change my mind. All right?

757
01:02:49,409 --> 01:02:52,045
Let's go.
Turn your machine on.

758
01:02:52,111 --> 01:02:53,546
Ooh. Ready to go for a swim?

759
01:02:53,613 --> 01:02:56,215
Yes.
This is gonna be so fun!

760
01:02:56,282 --> 01:02:58,251
Just shut up and turn it on.

761
01:03:17,804 --> 01:03:20,673
...prolongs your sense of time.

762
01:03:23,176 --> 01:03:26,446
Whatever happens,
don't let them stop until it's done.

763
01:04:08,354 --> 01:04:11,591
He'll hold his breath
as long as he can, and then...

764
01:04:11,657 --> 01:04:13,826
base instinct
takes over.

765
01:04:30,343 --> 01:04:31,811
Twenty-two.
Too many.

766
01:04:34,414 --> 01:04:36,682
Twenty.
No more. And 18.

767
01:04:54,834 --> 01:04:56,536
Oh, my God.
He's drowning.

768
01:04:56,936 --> 01:04:58,704
That's the whole idea.

769
01:05:02,442 --> 01:05:06,212
- Maybe we should pull him out.
- He's not there yet. Two more minutes.

770
01:05:13,252 --> 01:05:15,388
Abel, listen to me.
If I fail...

771
01:05:19,892 --> 01:05:21,327
Come on.

772
01:05:21,394 --> 01:05:24,363
- Nora...
- He's dying.

773
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:26,466
We're close.
We are close.

774
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:33,272
Doesn't have a pulse!

775
01:05:34,774 --> 01:05:35,775
Get him out!

776
01:05:41,914 --> 01:05:42,915
Come on!
Come on.

777
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:55,828
Okay. Okay.

778
01:05:56,762 --> 01:05:58,564
Get out of the way.

779
01:06:02,835 --> 01:06:04,604
No!

780
01:06:16,482 --> 01:06:17,783
He's gone.

781
01:06:20,953 --> 01:06:22,922
We killed him.

782
01:06:46,479 --> 01:06:49,715
If I fail, look inside.

783
01:07:14,006 --> 01:07:16,876
Evan, you're okay. Just breathe.

784
01:07:32,491 --> 01:07:35,528
I am Treadway.
I am Treadway.

785
01:07:45,404 --> 01:07:46,772
Hey. Whoa, whoa.

786
01:07:49,742 --> 01:07:51,043
I'm Treadway.

787
01:07:54,614 --> 01:07:58,017
If you are Treadway,
answer this:

788
01:07:58,918 --> 01:08:01,053
Do you know
where the Egg is?

789
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:22,775
Yes.

790
01:08:23,142 --> 01:08:24,577
- Yes?
- Yes.

791
01:08:25,244 --> 01:08:27,947
Look inside. Look inside.

792
01:08:30,549 --> 01:08:32,985
We were trained to think of
bodies as unimportant, right?

793
01:08:33,052 --> 01:08:35,554
- Right.
- Just shells meant to be discarded.

794
01:08:36,289 --> 01:08:38,557
Well, Treadway knew
the one place

795
01:08:38,624 --> 01:08:40,326
that nobody would look.

796
01:08:55,775 --> 01:08:58,077
Abel? Abel, listen to me.

797
01:08:58,144 --> 01:09:00,446
If I fail, look inside.

798
01:09:00,846 --> 01:09:02,615
It's in his body.

799
01:09:03,115 --> 01:09:04,350
Back at the Hub.

800
01:09:07,453 --> 01:09:09,989
It's been there the whole time.
Come on.

801
01:09:11,957 --> 01:09:13,993
I am shocked that that worked.

802
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:23,035
I knew it was you the whole time.
That's why I let you win.

803
01:09:23,102 --> 01:09:24,070
Oh, you let me, huh?

804
01:09:24,136 --> 01:09:25,771
Whoo! I don't know
about you guys,

805
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:27,740
but I could use a drink.

806
01:09:27,807 --> 01:09:29,075
Come on,
we don't have time for...

807
01:09:30,876 --> 01:09:32,945
Security lockdown!

808
01:09:36,215 --> 01:09:37,483
I'm hit.

809
01:09:37,817 --> 01:09:39,018
You all right?

810
01:09:44,223 --> 01:09:45,458
Hey!

811
01:09:45,524 --> 01:09:46,959
Follow me.

812
01:09:47,026 --> 01:09:49,128
Come on. We gotta go.

813
01:09:49,195 --> 01:09:51,464
Open emergency lift.

814
01:09:54,667 --> 01:09:55,935
- We gotta go. We gotta go.
- Wait!

815
01:09:56,002 --> 01:09:57,670
Are you crazy?
They're about to breach!

816
01:09:57,737 --> 01:10:00,606
We're not running, all right?
I'm tired of running.

817
01:10:00,673 --> 01:10:03,509
- I'm gonna fight 'em right now.
- Hang in there, Trace.

818
01:10:09,181 --> 01:10:10,149
She's dead.

819
01:10:10,216 --> 01:10:11,617
Oh, sh...

820
01:10:11,684 --> 01:10:14,687
Guys, we need to leave now.

821
01:10:21,761 --> 01:10:23,763
- I'm staying.
- What?

822
01:10:23,829 --> 01:10:25,865
We stay here,
we fight 'em now.

823
01:10:30,102 --> 01:10:32,938
- You're leaking like the Titanic.
- I'm fine.

824
01:10:33,005 --> 01:10:35,941
If you die here,
who stops Bathurst?

825
01:10:36,675 --> 01:10:37,877
He's right.

826
01:10:38,711 --> 01:10:39,779
Hey.

827
01:10:39,845 --> 01:10:43,749
You make this worth it,
dziecko.

828
01:10:44,583 --> 01:10:46,552
Then buy me some time.

829
01:10:47,186 --> 01:10:48,888
Open weapons room door.

830
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:52,725
Good luck.

831
01:12:05,865 --> 01:12:07,032
Careful, sir.

832
01:12:08,667 --> 01:12:10,002
Oh, I will be.

833
01:13:16,068 --> 01:13:18,871
We're taking Treadway's
body to Scotland.

834
01:13:18,938 --> 01:13:20,105
Very well.

835
01:13:21,874 --> 01:13:23,642
Keep him alive.

836
01:13:23,709 --> 01:13:27,112
I'll do the best I can,
but he's lost a lot of blood.

837
01:13:28,013 --> 01:13:30,082
The keys are in the car.

838
01:13:53,472 --> 01:13:55,074
Heinrich.

839
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:57,376
Good of you to join us.

840
01:14:00,212 --> 01:14:03,215
I only wish you were
here to see this...

841
01:14:04,483 --> 01:14:06,252
to understand your...

842
01:14:07,886 --> 01:14:10,122
your role in this.

843
01:14:16,261 --> 01:14:18,430
The end of all our debates.

844
01:14:45,991 --> 01:14:48,460
The end of all things.

845
01:14:52,798 --> 01:14:55,067
Have it cleaned and tested.

846
01:14:55,134 --> 01:14:57,336
Make sure
it's the real thing.

847
01:14:57,770 --> 01:14:59,805
Is it really over?

848
01:14:59,872 --> 01:15:01,774
Not quite yet.

849
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,343
Never underestimate
Treadway.

850
01:15:31,503 --> 01:15:34,073
Ah. You're awake.

851
01:15:34,139 --> 01:15:35,941
Where am I?

852
01:15:36,008 --> 01:15:39,445
I told Nora I'd wait with
you until you woke up.

853
01:15:39,511 --> 01:15:42,781
You're in my safe house.

854
01:15:42,848 --> 01:15:46,985
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing your morphine!

855
01:15:47,052 --> 01:15:48,287
Where is she?

856
01:15:48,353 --> 01:15:50,422
Huh?
Oh, she went after Bathurst.

857
01:15:51,523 --> 01:15:52,958
Oh, shit.

858
01:15:53,025 --> 01:15:56,028
She's not doing this alone.
No way.

859
01:15:56,762 --> 01:15:59,832
Whoa, whoa! Come on, man.

860
01:15:59,898 --> 01:16:03,469
You try running out now, you'll bleed
out before you reach the compound.

861
01:16:03,535 --> 01:16:07,206
If we're going down,
we're going down together.

862
01:16:07,272 --> 01:16:09,174
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

863
01:16:09,241 --> 01:16:12,211
I just patched you up, man.

864
01:16:12,277 --> 01:16:15,180
Let me catch you up
on the current situation.

865
01:16:15,247 --> 01:16:17,349
If Bathurst gets his way,
we're all done.

866
01:16:17,416 --> 01:16:19,451
There's no more
second chances.

867
01:16:19,518 --> 01:16:22,054
I'm gonna get the Egg
and kill him.

868
01:16:22,688 --> 01:16:24,490
She told me you were one of us.

869
01:16:24,556 --> 01:16:27,126
Obviously,
you're just full of shit.

870
01:16:28,527 --> 01:16:32,064
Diagnostics are done.
The bomb is ready for the Egg.

871
01:16:32,131 --> 01:16:34,133
Have them load it
on the plane.

872
01:16:42,307 --> 01:16:44,877
Come here, you bastard.

873
01:16:44,943 --> 01:16:47,146
Do you think He'll...

874
01:16:48,247 --> 01:16:50,315
let us do this?

875
01:16:52,117 --> 01:16:53,318
No?

876
01:16:59,291 --> 01:17:01,326
The end of all things.

877
01:17:08,233 --> 01:17:10,002
Go.

878
01:18:32,017 --> 01:18:35,220
- Move, move, move!
- On the rig! Let's go!

879
01:19:10,088 --> 01:19:11,423
Move, move!

880
01:20:37,275 --> 01:20:41,446
Dropping in three, two, one.

881
01:20:56,495 --> 01:20:58,163
- Do you need a ride?
- Love one.

882
01:20:59,498 --> 01:21:02,167
- You okay?
- No. Don't ask.

883
01:21:12,911 --> 01:21:16,581
Did you see that?

884
01:22:18,577 --> 01:22:20,479
Nora, you okay?

885
01:22:20,545 --> 01:22:22,714
Okay, come on.

886
01:22:22,781 --> 01:22:23,782
I got you.

887
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:30,722
I'll get you out of here.
Come on.

888
01:22:36,561 --> 01:22:37,863
You all right?

889
01:22:37,929 --> 01:22:39,231
Oh, shit.

890
01:22:39,297 --> 01:22:41,433
Hey. We gotta get you
out of here.

891
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:51,877
- You gonna be okay to move?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

892
01:22:51,943 --> 01:22:53,178
Okay. Come on.

893
01:23:32,784 --> 01:23:35,253
- You gotta go.
- Bathurst is getting away.

894
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:38,657
His hard drives are here.
I have to destroy them and free them all.

895
01:23:39,624 --> 01:23:40,992
I'll see you again.

896
01:25:23,928 --> 01:25:26,965
We'll be landing in Glasgow
in 16 minutes, sir.

897
01:25:27,966 --> 01:25:29,100
Stay low.

898
01:25:31,069 --> 01:25:32,604
Use TFR.

899
01:25:36,074 --> 01:25:37,342
Oh, my God.

900
01:25:40,078 --> 01:25:42,614
Come on. Come on.

901
01:25:48,153 --> 01:25:50,455
They're all here.

902
01:25:50,522 --> 01:25:51,856
All the souls.

903
01:25:52,757 --> 01:25:55,126
We have to free them all.

904
01:25:55,193 --> 01:25:57,562
Whoa!

905
01:25:57,629 --> 01:25:59,531
Nora. Nora, hey. Hey.

906
01:25:59,597 --> 01:26:02,767
Stay with me, okay?
We are so close.

907
01:26:03,301 --> 01:26:05,770
Let's blow some shit up,
huh?

908
01:26:27,525 --> 01:26:29,427
Shit!

909
01:26:29,494 --> 01:26:30,895
We've lost engine three, sir.

910
01:26:38,703 --> 01:26:40,805
We're gonna have to
land the aircraft.

911
01:26:48,179 --> 01:26:50,815
What the hell
are you doing? Sir!

912
01:26:58,056 --> 01:27:00,859
Please! You're gonna
crash the aircraft. Sir!

913
01:28:06,925 --> 01:28:09,093
It's impossible.

914
01:28:10,295 --> 01:28:12,163
I-Impossible.

915
01:28:23,942 --> 01:28:25,276
He's opened
the bloody top hatch, sir.

916
01:29:17,328 --> 01:29:19,030
You disappoint me.

917
01:29:20,965 --> 01:29:23,167
No recognition
whatsoever, huh?

918
01:29:23,735 --> 01:29:25,303
I think I should feel hurt.

919
01:29:27,071 --> 01:29:30,341
Car crash?
Steel plate, remember?

920
01:31:48,346 --> 01:31:51,783
Treadway,
you can't deactivate it!

921
01:31:52,817 --> 01:31:54,452
It's happening!

922
01:32:36,394 --> 01:32:38,262
No!

923
01:33:11,896 --> 01:33:14,365
Death isn't the end.
Not for us.

924
01:33:14,432 --> 01:33:16,901
Maybe not for any of us.

925
01:33:16,968 --> 01:33:19,303
New chapter, same story.

926
01:33:21,072 --> 01:33:22,473
I can carry you out.

927
01:33:23,074 --> 01:33:24,175
No way.

928
01:33:24,242 --> 01:33:26,310
I'll free them.

929
01:33:27,545 --> 01:33:28,513
Here.

930
01:33:31,983 --> 01:33:33,951
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

931
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:49,200
I'll find you in the Beginning.

932
01:33:49,267 --> 01:33:50,568
I love you.

933
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,521
I ask myself...

934
01:34:11,189 --> 01:34:14,325
what did being Evan McCauley
teach me?

935
01:34:20,164 --> 01:34:23,568
If each new life is a
chance to build on what was,

936
01:34:23,634 --> 01:34:26,938
a chance to press forward
to the best of what could be...

937
01:34:28,673 --> 01:34:30,575
Go, go, go!

938
01:34:30,641 --> 01:34:33,911
...why will some of us have to pick
up the sword and fight again...

939
01:34:46,724 --> 01:34:49,527
...while others discover
a new beginning?

940
01:35:03,007 --> 01:35:04,408
Nora?

941
01:35:12,516 --> 01:35:15,453
It's hope.
That's what I learned.

942
01:35:15,519 --> 01:35:18,956
Yes, we fall.
Yes, we fail.

943
01:35:19,023 --> 01:35:21,626
Yes, sometimes we screw up
everything we touch.

944
01:35:21,692 --> 01:35:24,428
But each moment we live
is connected by a belief

945
01:35:24,495 --> 01:35:29,967
that the actions we take will
next day, next week, next life

946
01:35:30,034 --> 01:35:31,602
add up to something more,

947
01:35:31,669 --> 01:35:34,338
something bigger
than yourself.

948
01:35:50,454 --> 01:35:54,392
And next... well,
the possibilities are...

949
01:35:55,226 --> 01:35:56,627
infinite.

950
01:37:07,798 --> 01:37:09,467
So...

951
01:37:09,533 --> 01:37:14,071
when your son starts asking
questions about his past,

952
01:37:14,138 --> 01:37:15,306
give me a call.

953
01:37:23,647 --> 01:37:26,417
- He says he's just a child.
- Ehh...

954
01:37:26,484 --> 01:37:28,152
What about your sword?

955
01:37:29,553 --> 01:37:31,555
Oh that's not my sword. It's
his.

956
01:37:37,495 --> 01:37:40,331
Artisan,
what took you so long?

957
01:37:41,165 --> 01:37:42,500
