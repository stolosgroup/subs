1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:02:49,074 --> 00:02:51,535
Marcy.
Call Mr. Barnell.

3
00:02:52,202 --> 00:02:54,204
Tell him I picked
up his wife again.

4
00:02:54,454 --> 00:02:56,123
I'm bringing her in.

5
00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:35,537
Need a hand?

6
00:03:37,122 --> 00:03:39,374
Oh, yeah.
You mind giving her a push?

7
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:40,250
Yeah.

8
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:41,752
Oh, great.
Thanks.

9
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:43,503
- On three, then.
- Okay.

10
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:46,673
One, two, three.

11
00:03:49,468 --> 00:03:51,845
Oh, that's great.
Thanks.

12
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:55,930
- I tell you, she may be fast,
but she sure ain't light. - Yeah.

13
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:58,894
You the new guy who just moved
into the Stevens' old house?

14
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:02,939
No. Name's Ted.
What is that, a Polaris?

15
00:04:03,106 --> 00:04:04,191
Oh, yeah!

16
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,942
What do those things go for?

17
00:04:06,568 --> 00:04:09,196
A lot more than I could
normally afford, I tell you.

18
00:04:11,323 --> 00:04:12,324
What's that?

19
00:04:13,784 --> 00:04:14,951
It's a video camera.

20
00:04:15,327 --> 00:04:17,079
- Hey, is that thing heavy?
- Yeah.

21
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:18,914
And you got it in
there by yourself?

22
00:04:19,956 --> 00:04:21,416
How's that on your back?

23
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,667
Oh, no.

24
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,963
Oh, please!
Turn the camera off!

25
00:04:27,255 --> 00:04:30,550
Ted! Oh, that's not nice!

26
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:35,263
That was really cool.
It was like watching "Cops".

27
00:04:35,514 --> 00:04:38,934
Yeah? Well, he was pretty spry
for a man with a herniated disk.

28
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:41,561
You know, I don't want
to bitch or anything,

29
00:04:41,686 --> 00:04:44,231
but you were supposed to
take me along on that one.

30
00:04:44,606 --> 00:04:45,982
Couldn't find you.

31
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:49,236
I know you know this but the sooner
they think I can handle things on my own,

32
00:04:49,403 --> 00:04:51,196
the sooner they'll kick
you back down south.

33
00:04:51,405 --> 00:04:54,282
Yeah, well, I've been hearing that for
thirteen months and six days, Cam.

34
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:56,201
After a while,
it gets a little old.

35
00:05:01,415 --> 00:05:03,250
Claims.
Watters.

36
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,752
Yeah.
Okay.

37
00:05:21,727 --> 00:05:23,103
That's quite the fish.

38
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:27,774
That one didn't get away.

39
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:31,194
Yeah, well... it's a nice catch.

40
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,781
This grasshopper walks in a bar.

41
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:38,577
And the bartender says,
"We have a drink named after you. "

42
00:05:38,744 --> 00:05:39,661
And the grasshopper says...

43
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,496
Paul Barnell.

44
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:43,193
Ted Watters.

45
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,130
- Mr. Watters.
- Pleasure.

46
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:47,419
Mine, too.

47
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:53,467
Ted, Mr. Barnell would like to discuss
his brother's life insurance policy with us.

48
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:55,218
- Raymond, right?
- Yes.

49
00:05:55,594 --> 00:05:58,597
Thing is, as I explained
to Mr. Branch,

50
00:05:59,514 --> 00:06:01,391
he's been gone for five years

51
00:06:01,516 --> 00:06:06,229
and I thought, time to move on.

52
00:06:06,563 --> 00:06:08,356
By move on, you mean?

53
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:10,358
I mean...

54
00:06:10,484 --> 00:06:13,236
I think that cashing
Raymond's policy.

55
00:06:14,488 --> 00:06:17,991
I doubt, after that time,
that he's still alive.

56
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:22,037
And my father always wanted us
to take care of each other

57
00:06:22,287 --> 00:06:24,581
if something should happen, and...

58
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,668
money is a little...

59
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,505
Yeah, I understand, Mr. Barnell.

60
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:33,173
But here's the thing.

61
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,177
With no actual body,
under Alaskan statutes,

62
00:06:37,302 --> 00:06:39,679
a person has to be
missing for seven years

63
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:43,517
before he or she can be
legally declared dead.

64
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:46,978
And that's not withstanding
an investigation period

65
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:49,689
where concerned parties can
take up to another year

66
00:06:49,815 --> 00:06:52,984
to file interventions
concerning the motion.

67
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:56,988
So, even though your brother's status
is undetermined at this point,

68
00:06:57,114 --> 00:06:59,408
there's really very little
we can do for you.

69
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,287
But we are extremely
sorry for your loss.

70
00:07:06,248 --> 00:07:07,499
Absolutely.

71
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,503
One, two, three...

72
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:40,467
All right. We'll get him later.

73
00:08:43,678 --> 00:08:45,972
Yes, this is Mr. Barnell.

74
00:08:46,181 --> 00:08:47,849
Mr. Barnell, this is John Hoag again

75
00:08:48,016 --> 00:08:50,394
from Municipal Power's Delinquent
Accounts Department.

76
00:08:50,776 --> 00:08:52,145
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Barnell,

77
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,232
I've tried every other option and,
frankly, this is unavoidable.

78
00:08:56,108 --> 00:08:57,359
Great.

79
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:58,485
Excuse me?

80
00:08:58,944 --> 00:09:00,570
No, I'm not...

81
00:09:04,908 --> 00:09:05,659
Hello?

82
00:09:06,618 --> 00:09:08,370
Hello?

83
00:09:08,495 --> 00:09:10,539
Yeah.
I paid that bill a week ago.

84
00:09:10,955 --> 00:09:13,557
- You did?
- I saw my secretary write it up.

85
00:09:13,592 --> 00:09:15,669
Do you have any idea
where that payment might be?

86
00:09:15,836 --> 00:09:18,630
I have no clue.

87
00:09:18,755 --> 00:09:21,800
I'm a patient man, Mr. Barnell
but your credit rating is blocked off.

88
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:23,844
I have a very good credit rating.

89
00:09:24,761 --> 00:09:25,846
No, you don't.

90
00:09:26,054 --> 00:09:26,972
How do you know that?

91
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:30,392
I've got your TRW file
in front of me, sir.

92
00:09:31,643 --> 00:09:34,563
Mr. Barnell?

93
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,776
Mr. Barnell?
Hello?

94
00:09:42,946 --> 00:09:43,947
Mr. Barnell?

95
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,701
<i>- Hey, kids, who's up for trout?
- No.</i>

96
00:12:01,877 --> 00:12:04,171
Jodie, no!
Not for dogs!

97
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:15,409
Honey, I'm home!

98
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:16,827
Any mail?

99
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:26,002
Psychic Pals.

100
00:13:26,837 --> 00:13:28,880
How are you today, Mr. Williams?

101
00:13:31,383 --> 00:13:34,829
- Well, we are all registered
psychics here. - Hi, Tiff.

102
00:13:34,928 --> 00:13:38,432
I just had this feeling you
needed to talk. So what's up?

103
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:43,395
Your TV remote control?

104
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:47,023
Well, I need you to clear your
mind for a few moments.

105
00:13:48,817 --> 00:13:50,527
It's stew.
I don't think it's still good.

106
00:13:50,652 --> 00:13:51,945
Hey, aren't you with a customer?

107
00:13:52,112 --> 00:13:53,071
They're concentrating.

108
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,032
How is he the tea
leaf business today?

109
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:59,953
I've decided, from now on, to ignore
you and your ignorance about my work.

110
00:14:00,746 --> 00:14:02,873
And it's going very well,
thank you.

111
00:14:02,998 --> 00:14:07,627
Mr. Williams?
I'm seeing sofa cushions.

112
00:14:07,794 --> 00:14:12,007
Do you have a sofa?
Good! Glad I could help.

113
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:15,469
Okay, before you
say anything else

114
00:14:15,677 --> 00:14:18,346
that may keep us from
having sex ever again

115
00:14:19,347 --> 00:14:20,182
let me ask you something.

116
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,933
No, I always get these wrong.

117
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,185
That's why we keep trying.

118
00:14:23,393 --> 00:14:25,437
I don't want to do this.

119
00:14:26,104 --> 00:14:28,523
Love Is Sacrifice quiz.

120
00:14:28,732 --> 00:14:30,192
If you were in a life raft with me,

121
00:14:30,358 --> 00:14:32,402
and there was only
enough water for one...

122
00:14:32,527 --> 00:14:33,779
No, I'm not going to do it.

123
00:14:34,112 --> 00:14:35,197
It's just a stupid quiz.

124
00:14:35,405 --> 00:14:36,323
Exactly.

125
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,617
What is that?

126
00:14:39,743 --> 00:14:41,203
I was just kidding.

127
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:49,294
Psychic Pals.

128
00:14:49,753 --> 00:14:51,797
Is this the first time
you've called us, Mrs...

129
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:55,717
Stupid quizzes can be illustrative
of potential relationship problems.

130
00:14:56,259 --> 00:14:59,513
Margaret, I'm getting the feeling
this is an anxious day for you.

131
00:14:59,638 --> 00:15:02,307
Hey, you know our only relationship
problem is that you're running a dollar,

132
00:15:02,516 --> 00:15:05,936
ninety-nine a minute carny
scam out of my living room.

133
00:15:06,353 --> 00:15:07,896
Don't call it a scam.

134
00:15:09,731 --> 00:15:11,983
Wait you didn't just call this
"your" living room, did you?

135
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,068
Ours.

136
00:15:13,276 --> 00:15:17,989
Margaret, I feel someone you really care
about, maybe even the love of your life

137
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:20,992
is being a real pain.

138
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:25,247
Now, I need you to really concentrate
and I'll be right back.

139
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:31,753
I thought stuff didn't smell
when it was frozen.

140
00:15:31,878 --> 00:15:33,130
I don't know why we have to...

141
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:35,590
'Cause Dave wants
visual confirmation.

142
00:15:35,882 --> 00:15:38,385
So Dave gets visual confirmation.

143
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:43,306
We have a chance to move up here,
Gary, so let's just do what we're told.

144
00:15:43,515 --> 00:15:45,976
What's he gonna do,
have him stuffed?

145
00:15:47,686 --> 00:15:50,605
Like the guy's not gonna
end up in a landfill anyway.

146
00:15:50,814 --> 00:15:52,774
You ever ask Dave what he did?

147
00:15:52,983 --> 00:15:53,817
Who knows.

148
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:57,028
But Dave said if he did it one more time,
he was gonna break his neck.

149
00:16:01,074 --> 00:16:02,117
So how did it feel?

150
00:16:03,076 --> 00:16:05,746
I mean, not when you did it,
but like now.

151
00:16:07,414 --> 00:16:08,957
I don't want to talk about it.

152
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,001
Okay.

153
00:16:24,973 --> 00:16:27,434
Jimbo! He's not here.

154
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:29,561
Gary, enough with
the little jokes, okay?

155
00:16:30,187 --> 00:16:31,730
I'm serious.
He's gone.

156
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:35,442
Don't even joke about it.

157
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,110
Maybe he wasn't...

158
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:39,196
dead.

159
00:16:43,492 --> 00:16:46,578
Hey, Jimbo!
There's a little fridge down here.

160
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,744
- Morning, Mr. Barnell.
- Morning, Avis.

161
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,378
- Coffee?
- If you insist.

162
00:17:08,141 --> 00:17:09,309
She looks good.

163
00:17:09,976 --> 00:17:13,063
"Waikiki Airlines,
your ticket to paradise. "

164
00:17:14,523 --> 00:17:16,608
Was last November this bad?

165
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:20,977
- If we didn't have the weather,
what would we talk about? - Yeah.

166
00:17:26,743 --> 00:17:27,786
Messages?

167
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:31,540
Just that fellow from Municipal
Power and Electric.

168
00:17:31,706 --> 00:17:33,583
I told him you sent the
check in weeks ago,

169
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:36,169
but some people
don't like to listen.

170
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:37,712
Sorry, what did you say?

171
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,680
Avis, something really spooky
happened last night.

172
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,724
You remember my
brother Raymond?

173
00:17:49,015 --> 00:17:50,100
The one who went missing?

174
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:55,272
Well, last night there
was a knock at the door

175
00:17:55,772 --> 00:17:58,024
and behold, there was
Raymond on my doorstep.

176
00:17:58,191 --> 00:17:59,735
Didn't you have him declared.

177
00:17:59,943 --> 00:18:03,113
Dead? Well, no... yes. Well,

178
00:18:03,321 --> 00:18:05,532
he wasn't gone long
enough really for that.

179
00:18:05,699 --> 00:18:07,576
Good thing. In hindsight.

180
00:18:07,784 --> 00:18:10,328
So... where was he
all these years?

181
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:13,999
Lower forty-eight.
Didn't like the cold.

182
00:18:14,124 --> 00:18:19,129
Well, that's great. You and Mrs. Barnell
will have some company for a bit, I guess.

183
00:18:21,423 --> 00:18:22,507
How is she?

184
00:18:22,716 --> 00:18:23,592
Better.

185
00:18:24,634 --> 00:18:26,344
A little better, you know.

186
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,810
Collecting, Mrs. Barnell.

187
00:18:33,935 --> 00:18:37,439
Daniel, you pussy little cocksucker.
I'll get my purse.

188
00:18:37,647 --> 00:18:40,192
It's twelve dollars.
I missed you last time.

189
00:18:40,358 --> 00:18:42,527
Jerk off. Jerk off.

190
00:18:43,028 --> 00:18:47,240
Jerk off.
Jerk off, jerk off, jerk off.

191
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,624
Tell your slut mom I said hi.

192
00:18:55,749 --> 00:18:57,375
Sure will.
Thanks.

193
00:18:58,502 --> 00:19:00,462
Some days are better
than others.

194
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:03,256
Better.

195
00:20:04,901 --> 00:20:07,237
Paul, why is the fridge in
the garage chained shut?

196
00:20:07,693 --> 00:20:09,156
- Possum.
- Hot pussy?

197
00:20:09,406 --> 00:20:11,032
Paul, dinner's almost ready.

198
00:20:11,158 --> 00:20:13,910
Oh, I feel like some wine.
You feel like some wine?

199
00:20:15,412 --> 00:20:18,790
You know, I have a crazy thought.

200
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,085
Let's order in tonight.

201
00:20:22,294 --> 00:20:23,044
- Fuck it?
- Yeah.

202
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:24,171
- Okay.
- Yeah.

203
00:20:24,796 --> 00:20:26,923
You know and I have to talk
to you about something.

204
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:28,884
Raymond's back.

205
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:57,788
And here he is.
Well, what you say Bobbie Ray?

206
00:20:57,996 --> 00:21:00,665
Ray's a little jealous,
just a little bit.

207
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:04,920
Margaret!
The one that got away.

208
00:21:06,421 --> 00:21:10,425
Beautiful signal on Margaret.
Lights on the deck.

209
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:22,771
Good... good stuff. Hold on.

210
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,950
Here's the Doctor.
It's time for my medicine.

211
00:21:36,827 --> 00:21:39,496
- That's okay. That's okay, okay,
- Let me get a towel.

212
00:21:39,621 --> 00:21:42,958
Don't worry about it. I'd like the
next one on the other leg, please.

213
00:21:44,376 --> 00:21:45,627
Good one, Margaret!

214
00:21:48,463 --> 00:21:49,464
Princess.

215
00:22:39,931 --> 00:22:43,351
Paul? Thank you so much
for clearing the driveway.

216
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,395
That was real considerate.

217
00:22:45,562 --> 00:22:48,023
Well, I don't know what you're
talking about, Mrs. Wherry.

218
00:22:48,273 --> 00:22:50,442
You were out at the
cabin this morning?

219
00:22:50,776 --> 00:22:53,445
Nice to see you getting
some use out of that thing.

220
00:22:53,653 --> 00:22:58,075
Oh, now I see. No, no, that was
Raymond you saw out there.

221
00:22:58,241 --> 00:22:59,201
He's alive?

222
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:01,703
Yeah, very much.

223
00:24:45,057 --> 00:24:46,808
Oh, God. Come on!

224
00:24:49,895 --> 00:24:53,106
How much easier do
I have to make this?

225
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,340
Margaret, you scared
the wits out of me.

226
00:25:18,465 --> 00:25:19,424
Look at the dog.

227
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,593
She's just a little puppy.

228
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,677
A little puppy she is.

229
00:25:22,803 --> 00:25:23,637
Little hungry puppy.

230
00:25:23,762 --> 00:25:24,930
A hungry, hungry puppy.

231
00:25:25,055 --> 00:25:26,181
- Yes.
- Yes, she is.

232
00:25:26,348 --> 00:25:27,557
- Come on over here.
- Well.

233
00:25:27,682 --> 00:25:29,226
How late is Rudy's open?

234
00:26:04,344 --> 00:26:06,054
I'm sorry about this part.

235
00:26:11,476 --> 00:26:12,436
Thank you.

236
00:26:27,868 --> 00:26:31,121
If it's any comfort, he likely
wasn't eaten while conscious.

237
00:26:31,371 --> 00:26:33,290
So it was the fall?

238
00:26:34,124 --> 00:26:36,755
Did he say where he was
living before he came? - Florida.

239
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,628
He didn't talk about it much.

240
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:40,505
He brought us this shell.

241
00:26:41,089 --> 00:26:45,427
It's all we have left, really.
Hadn't seen him for five years.

242
00:26:45,594 --> 00:26:46,928
We'd given him up for...

243
00:26:47,095 --> 00:26:48,805
For dead, yes, sir.

244
00:26:50,557 --> 00:26:51,850
How did you...?

245
00:26:52,017 --> 00:26:54,394
Anonymous phone tip from
some Jamaican... guy.

246
00:26:54,561 --> 00:26:55,270
Jamaican?

247
00:26:55,437 --> 00:26:57,355
He said he saw what he
thought was a body.

248
00:26:57,522 --> 00:26:59,483
We tracked you through his ID.

249
00:26:59,608 --> 00:27:01,026
Just like on TV.

250
00:27:02,194 --> 00:27:03,487
I have to see him.

251
00:27:03,612 --> 00:27:06,573
Mr. Barnell, I have to warn you,
an animal attack isn't pretty.

252
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,574
I know.

253
00:27:07,699 --> 00:27:09,076
There's not much left.

254
00:27:10,994 --> 00:27:12,079
Oh, God.

255
00:27:14,206 --> 00:27:15,373
Is that your brother, sir?

256
00:27:15,499 --> 00:27:17,125
Yeah.
That's him.

257
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:19,711
Chewed his ears off.

258
00:27:20,712 --> 00:27:22,881
What kind of animal does
something like that?

259
00:27:23,423 --> 00:27:25,342
Normally, I'd say a bear.

260
00:27:25,926 --> 00:27:28,970
But with these tracks and the
feeding pattern, indicate wolf.

261
00:27:29,846 --> 00:27:32,057
It's rare, but it can happen.

262
00:27:41,983 --> 00:27:44,152
Your brother's personal effects.

263
00:27:44,945 --> 00:27:47,114
Marcy, would you...

264
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,115
Yeah, no problem.

265
00:27:48,782 --> 00:27:50,847
- Come on, let's go this way.
- Thank you.

266
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,704
Coroner found some smaller
bite marks on the ankle.

267
00:27:54,871 --> 00:27:57,541
Pups. Must have been
the whole freaking pack.

268
00:27:57,707 --> 00:27:59,209
Derek found this.

269
00:28:00,836 --> 00:28:03,171
Not the smartest
snack for a hiker.

270
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:06,758
Messy animals, aren't they?

271
00:28:07,384 --> 00:28:11,221
Messy. Messy, messy,
messy, messy.

272
00:28:11,388 --> 00:28:14,891
- Here ya go, say cheese!
- Cheese!

273
00:28:19,104 --> 00:28:20,605
Shit!

274
00:28:21,106 --> 00:28:23,650
You know, there are some
places on this planet

275
00:28:23,775 --> 00:28:25,694
where people actually
do this outside.

276
00:28:29,614 --> 00:28:32,659
So how many insurance companies
are there in the United States?

277
00:28:32,826 --> 00:28:35,579
- Like a billion.
- That's not the point, Tiffany.

278
00:28:35,704 --> 00:28:37,748
That's not the point, Tiffany. I busted
my ass for Liberty Capital, all right?

279
00:28:37,873 --> 00:28:39,040
I don't want to quit.

280
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:40,876
I want to be promoted.

281
00:28:41,626 --> 00:28:45,213
I want to be promoted out
of this icebound backwater.

282
00:28:46,757 --> 00:28:47,591
Okay.

283
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:50,385
And when that happens,
I guess I'll just be another

284
00:28:50,552 --> 00:28:52,637
notch on your briefcase.

285
00:28:55,515 --> 00:28:57,309
I can't believe you just said that.

286
00:28:58,727 --> 00:29:04,483
Well, you know that you're the most
most important thing in my life.

287
00:29:05,067 --> 00:29:09,571
Sorry, what was that?
You wanna take me right here?

288
00:29:09,863 --> 00:29:13,033
Tiffany, what do you want...?

289
00:29:16,286 --> 00:29:17,370
You gonna get that?

290
00:29:23,251 --> 00:29:25,504
Psych... I'm sorry, hello?

291
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,463
Who is it?

292
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,589
Yeah?

293
00:29:28,173 --> 00:29:30,926
Look, is this a matter of life
and death? Because...

294
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:32,052
Tiff, give me the phone.

295
00:29:32,594 --> 00:29:33,970
Yeah.
Hello?

296
00:29:38,016 --> 00:29:39,101
You're kidding.

297
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:40,477
Your mom?

298
00:29:42,437 --> 00:29:44,815
A million dollar life
policy just checked.

299
00:29:46,358 --> 00:29:51,196
On a Saturday? What about the First
Annual Golf, Sex and Pizza Triathlon?

300
00:29:51,363 --> 00:29:52,531
Look, Tiffany,
if this is who I think it is

301
00:29:52,697 --> 00:29:54,074
I may have found us
a ticket out of here, so...

302
00:29:54,241 --> 00:29:55,575
We don't need a ticket.

303
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:59,037
Yeah, can I call you back?
Okay.

304
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,791
We... I mean...

305
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:05,001
Don't be late, okay?

306
00:30:06,086 --> 00:30:07,629
You won't even know I'm gone.

307
00:30:16,054 --> 00:30:18,473
That's him. Raymond Barnell.

308
00:30:20,142 --> 00:30:22,811
So, what's your line on this?

309
00:30:23,103 --> 00:30:26,314
Just what it looks like.
Wolves got him.

310
00:30:27,107 --> 00:30:29,025
Maybe a grizzly with insomnia,

311
00:30:29,192 --> 00:30:30,944
but I couldn't find any tracks.

312
00:30:31,862 --> 00:30:32,821
Well, would it surprise
you to learn

313
00:30:32,988 --> 00:30:36,158
that his brother tried to cash in
his policy not two weeks ago?

314
00:30:36,324 --> 00:30:37,492
What are you trying to tell me

315
00:30:37,617 --> 00:30:39,870
that Mr. Barnell chewed off
his brother's leg?

316
00:30:40,036 --> 00:30:43,457
Well, doesn't it make you the
least bit suspicious that maybe...

317
00:30:43,623 --> 00:30:47,210
Mr. Watters, I don't know
thing one about insurance...

318
00:30:47,335 --> 00:30:51,590
but I'm guessing it's your job to find
a way not to pay these poor people.

319
00:30:51,757 --> 00:30:54,217
This is a nice, simple ending.

320
00:30:54,801 --> 00:30:57,763
We like nice, simple endings.

321
00:31:03,351 --> 00:31:06,938
Chief? Good news, bad news.

322
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:12,152
The good news, he's dead.
Bad news, he disappeared.

323
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,488
Proof, Jimbo.
You got one week.

324
00:31:14,613 --> 00:31:15,530
It was our first time.

325
00:31:15,655 --> 00:31:17,699
Nobody gets it perfect
their first time, Dave.

326
00:31:17,824 --> 00:31:19,201
Mr. Branch, this is
not a standard case.

327
00:31:19,326 --> 00:31:21,036
You were there when the guy
came in and tried to cash in.

328
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:22,788
I mean, come on.
It stinks.

329
00:31:23,163 --> 00:31:27,250
Watters, if the police say
that this guy was...

330
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:29,544
Eaten by wolves, sir.

331
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:33,006
...eaten by wolves,
then we've got no case.

332
00:31:33,465 --> 00:31:36,718
Did you happen to see Mr. Barnell
on the news last night?

333
00:31:36,885 --> 00:31:38,637
The police told us
what happened.

334
00:31:38,762 --> 00:31:40,389
How are you folks holding up?

335
00:31:40,514 --> 00:31:43,475
Well, my wife is too
upset to be here.

336
00:31:43,642 --> 00:31:45,435
Paul?
Who's out there?

337
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,855
As I said, she's very upset.

338
00:31:49,022 --> 00:31:50,399
Paul?
The door's stuck.

339
00:31:50,607 --> 00:31:53,443
It's tough, though,
'cause you have to ask yourself...

340
00:31:53,568 --> 00:31:55,529
Who fucked with
the fucking door?

341
00:31:56,613 --> 00:31:58,782
You see how stressful
his has been.

342
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:02,369
I have to go now because we have
a service to plan. Excuse me.

343
00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:05,956
Hi.

344
00:32:06,832 --> 00:32:09,418
Well, what we don't
need is bad PR.

345
00:32:09,543 --> 00:32:11,712
I don't want this thing
Valdezing on us.

346
00:32:11,878 --> 00:32:13,380
Mr. Branch I'm sure
that head office

347
00:32:13,547 --> 00:32:15,340
would take a rather dim view
of our approach to...

348
00:32:15,465 --> 00:32:19,052
Corporate's view will
be what I tell them.

349
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,304
Okay.

350
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:26,059
Yes, sir.
Color us "called off" as of now.

351
00:32:26,852 --> 00:32:29,730
Thanks, Cam.
Thanks a lot.

352
00:32:30,147 --> 00:32:33,525
Thanks for, all the back up.

353
00:32:33,692 --> 00:32:36,528
You got a strange way of bucking
for a promotion, my friend.

354
00:32:37,612 --> 00:32:39,698
Look, I'm gonna start
on the Johnson file.

355
00:32:39,865 --> 00:32:41,867
You wanna do up the
paperwork on Barnell?

356
00:32:45,162 --> 00:32:46,329
Where you going?

357
00:32:46,455 --> 00:32:47,247
Lunch.

358
00:32:47,497 --> 00:32:49,116
- At nine-thirty?
- Yeah.

359
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:51,251
We got seven joints here.

360
00:32:51,418 --> 00:32:54,796
We got a card place, we got a
Great Escape Travel, hair joint.

361
00:32:55,088 --> 00:32:57,257
Which one you figure'd
wanna take our friend?

362
00:32:59,051 --> 00:33:03,597
The police say they found Raymond's wallet
and that's how they tracked you down.

363
00:33:03,764 --> 00:33:06,975
- Yes, that's right. - Any idea
what he was doing out there?

364
00:33:07,768 --> 00:33:10,896
He'd take walks.
Hikes.

365
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:12,939
Hiking.

366
00:33:14,191 --> 00:33:15,400
How sporty.

367
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:19,529
- Can I get you a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.

368
00:33:19,821 --> 00:33:21,198
Was he a big hiker?

369
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:24,534
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

370
00:33:25,035 --> 00:33:28,455
Well, would he hike more than once a
week or was this just a one time thing?

371
00:33:29,998 --> 00:33:32,042
May I ask why you need
to know all this?

372
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:35,253
Just trying to tie up some
loose ends, Mr. Barnell.

373
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:39,716
You know, the police they say
my brother died in the attack.

374
00:33:40,675 --> 00:33:43,261
Now, you do cover that
sort of thing, don't you?

375
00:33:43,387 --> 00:33:46,973
Yes, sir, Mr. Barnell, and it shouldn't
take more than a few days.

376
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:51,103
Now, can you uh, can you tell me
a little bit more about your brother?

377
00:33:51,228 --> 00:33:52,229
The hiker?

378
00:34:07,452 --> 00:34:08,787
How is my princess?

379
00:34:14,042 --> 00:34:15,210
What's up?

380
00:34:16,503 --> 00:34:17,879
I took some Adavan.

381
00:34:20,924 --> 00:34:22,426
And called my psychic.

382
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:23,802
You know we can't afford that.

383
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,095
- We talked about that. Okay.
- Don't be mad.

384
00:34:25,262 --> 00:34:28,557
- It's just this week has been so...
- I know. I know.

385
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:31,017
Well, with Raymond
getting eaten by animals

386
00:34:31,184 --> 00:34:33,186
and someone trying
to steal the fridge.

387
00:34:33,687 --> 00:34:36,231
We got another letter
from the HMO today.

388
00:34:40,402 --> 00:34:41,778
Hey, come on now.
Come on.

389
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:46,491
I'm sorry.

390
00:34:48,368 --> 00:34:50,537
Fucking cocksuckers.

391
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:58,045
"As we previously stated
in the genetic history... "

392
00:34:58,211 --> 00:35:00,255
I'm sick.
I'm really, really sick, you know?

393
00:35:02,132 --> 00:35:05,385
I know. "Tourette's Syndrome is not
easily diagnosed. No... "

394
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,553
Fuck, fuck!

395
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,223
"... onset before the age of 18
and no genetic history... "

396
00:35:10,348 --> 00:35:12,809
"Please reference
our previous discussions... "

397
00:35:12,976 --> 00:35:17,439
"... concerning you claims for... "
"... OCD, ODD, ADHP... "

398
00:35:18,815 --> 00:35:20,859
It's what's going down at the
beginning of the century.

399
00:35:20,984 --> 00:35:22,652
Margaret!

400
00:35:22,778 --> 00:35:23,737
But still in matters vegetable,
animal and mineral...

401
00:35:23,904 --> 00:35:25,614
I am the very model of a modern
Major-General.

402
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:27,741
Margaret!

403
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:32,871
I know you don't like
to talk about this.

404
00:35:33,663 --> 00:35:36,500
But maybe it's not what
we think it is, you know?

405
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:39,086
Yeah, maybe it's not.

406
00:35:39,211 --> 00:35:40,879
Maybe it's just stress.

407
00:35:44,591 --> 00:35:45,926
Remember that cruise?

408
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:50,263
I saw you.

409
00:35:51,556 --> 00:35:52,766
You were happy.

410
00:35:55,977 --> 00:35:59,773
You were this sweet, happy person.
Kind and giving.

411
00:36:02,692 --> 00:36:04,903
I'm sorry. I'm tired, you know.

412
00:36:05,028 --> 00:36:09,449
They say you can't get it all of a sudden,
but I did. I really, really did.

413
00:36:09,616 --> 00:36:12,285
I know. I know.

414
00:36:14,037 --> 00:36:15,163
Well, I'll kill myself.

415
00:36:15,288 --> 00:36:16,706
No, come on, that's nonsense!

416
00:36:16,832 --> 00:36:19,376
- Then they'll see.
- No, that's nonsense talk. Come here.

417
00:36:19,543 --> 00:36:21,169
No, come on now.

418
00:36:21,336 --> 00:36:22,921
...marry someone normal.

419
00:36:23,088 --> 00:36:24,798
You're the most normal girl I know.

420
00:36:24,923 --> 00:36:27,134
I'm not crazy, Paul.

421
00:36:28,135 --> 00:36:31,096
- There's something wrong with me.
- I know, sweetie.

422
00:36:32,305 --> 00:36:37,060
And we're gonna find the best
specialists for what you have we can.

423
00:36:38,228 --> 00:36:39,813
- Really?
- Yeah.

424
00:36:41,523 --> 00:36:43,817
I know things are
gonna turn around.

425
00:36:44,651 --> 00:36:49,239
Call me cra...
I got this feeling. I do.

426
00:36:49,781 --> 00:36:52,534
But you have to leave everything
up to me, okay?

427
00:36:53,869 --> 00:36:55,662
You leave everything up to me,

428
00:36:56,705 --> 00:37:00,125
and you're gonna be okay.
I promise.

429
00:37:14,973 --> 00:37:16,141
Shit bag.

430
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,395
That's my girl.

431
00:37:27,152 --> 00:37:30,072
Yeah, hi. This is Ted Watters
from Liberty Capital.

432
00:37:30,197 --> 00:37:34,284
I was wondering if I could get a complete
credit workup on a Raymond Barnell

433
00:37:34,451 --> 00:37:38,789
and a Paul Barnell, as well.

434
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:40,957
Yes, I will hold.

435
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:43,126
You start the month ends yet?

436
00:37:43,293 --> 00:37:46,755
Oh, can you take care of that for me?
I'm kinda working on something here, Cam.

437
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,674
Oh, God. You're not still
on the Barnell thing, are you?

438
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,139
I went to go see him.

439
00:37:56,264 --> 00:37:57,099
And? And?

440
00:37:57,265 --> 00:38:00,685
So, trust me, something's not right.
I can smell it. Just help me buy a week.

441
00:38:00,852 --> 00:38:02,020
We're gonna get
in such trouble.

442
00:38:02,145 --> 00:38:05,232
Okay, from now on, you can come
along with me on everything.

443
00:38:05,357 --> 00:38:09,152
No more Cam goes to the coffee room
and Ted disappears for three hours?

444
00:38:09,903 --> 00:38:11,154
I'll try, yeah.

445
00:38:11,279 --> 00:38:13,865
And you'll work on your
interpersonal skills?

446
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,452
- Yes.
- Good.

447
00:38:17,619 --> 00:38:20,914
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll go start covering your ass.

448
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,375
Oh, hi.
Yeah, sorry.

449
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:26,545
Are all these yours?

450
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,130
Greatest sport on earth.

451
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,841
Moved to a compound
bow two years ago.

452
00:38:31,007 --> 00:38:32,884
Arthritis. Less draw weight.

453
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,803
Tea okay?

454
00:38:34,928 --> 00:38:37,556
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

455
00:38:37,681 --> 00:38:42,394
I was just wondering, did you happen
to talk to Raymond when he got back?

456
00:38:42,561 --> 00:38:45,981
Only saw him the once.
Never spoke to him.

457
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:47,774
Waved to him.

458
00:38:48,817 --> 00:38:49,735
You waved?

459
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,778
He was clearing my driveway.

460
00:38:52,738 --> 00:38:55,490
Raymond was a real hellcat
when he was younger.

461
00:38:55,657 --> 00:38:59,286
But like they say, time mellows
even the hardest soul.

462
00:38:59,494 --> 00:39:02,164
Was he much of an outdoo
rsman or ahiker or...?

463
00:39:02,289 --> 00:39:04,207
I thought it was Paul at first.

464
00:39:09,504 --> 00:39:11,173
Have you talked to Paul's wife?

465
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,091
Now there's a story.

466
00:39:13,216 --> 00:39:15,886
Not that I'm much of a one for gossip,
but I think that...

467
00:39:16,011 --> 00:39:19,306
I'm sorry. Did you say you thought it
was Paul that did your driveway?

468
00:39:24,019 --> 00:39:26,521
Okay. It turns out that Mr. Barnell
is mortgaged to the nuts.

469
00:39:26,688 --> 00:39:29,316
His business is about one step
away from Chapter 11.

470
00:39:29,483 --> 00:39:31,693
Plus, it's like his brother Raymond
never even existed.

471
00:39:31,818 --> 00:39:32,903
There's no credit history,

472
00:39:33,028 --> 00:39:35,238
there's no nothing for
the last five years.

473
00:39:35,405 --> 00:39:37,449
Plus the only thing he did
after his recent reappearance...

474
00:39:37,574 --> 00:39:41,495
was get some new ID and a new credit
card, but he didn't charge anything.

475
00:39:41,661 --> 00:39:43,789
Less than nothing.

476
00:39:44,414 --> 00:39:46,333
- Okay, well, it's something.
- No, it's not.

477
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,878
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

478
00:39:50,962 --> 00:39:52,506
Claims, Watters.

479
00:39:53,215 --> 00:39:54,758
This is personal.

480
00:39:56,134 --> 00:39:57,344
I promise.

481
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,975
Mr. Barnell, your ears must
have been burning. I was just...

482
00:40:04,851 --> 00:40:06,812
Oh, yeah, sure, yeah.

483
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,230
What time?

484
00:40:09,606 --> 00:40:13,485
Why is God, who is a loving God,
capable of such things?

485
00:40:14,653 --> 00:40:18,865
When someone is taken from us at such
a young age, we often ourselves why.

486
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:19,866
Bullshit.

487
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:23,120
What possible purpose
could this serve?

488
00:40:23,245 --> 00:40:27,457
But I believe the Apostle Paul,
writing to the Ephesians,

489
00:40:27,624 --> 00:40:32,629
said it best when he said "All things
are done according to God's will. "

490
00:40:32,754 --> 00:40:33,839
Nun banger.

491
00:40:38,468 --> 00:40:39,678
Doggies!

492
00:40:39,845 --> 00:40:41,972
Raymond Barnell, Barnell's Travel.

493
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,807
We should have seen it earlier.

494
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:47,227
We should have checked the funeral
announcements right away.

495
00:40:47,352 --> 00:40:50,272
Mr. Barnell, there was really
no hurry on this. I mean...

496
00:40:50,397 --> 00:40:51,732
we could've waited until later.

497
00:40:51,857 --> 00:40:53,066
We just wrapped up.

498
00:40:54,025 --> 00:40:55,610
This is my wife, Margaret.

499
00:40:55,777 --> 00:40:59,281
Sweetheart, why don't you go
sit in the car and warm up, okay?

500
00:40:59,406 --> 00:41:00,907
Okey dokey, Smokey.

501
00:41:05,495 --> 00:41:08,040
She's been under
a lot of stress lately.

502
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:11,251
I notice the media's here.

503
00:41:12,377 --> 00:41:15,005
They really don't give people
a moment's peace, do they?

504
00:41:17,382 --> 00:41:18,592
I called them.

505
00:41:21,553 --> 00:41:22,429
Really?

506
00:41:22,596 --> 00:41:24,514
They wanted to talk
to me about Raymond,

507
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:27,476
and I thought now would be
an appropriate time.

508
00:41:27,642 --> 00:41:29,895
And you'll just happen to mention
your heartless insurance company

509
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,354
that hasn't paid off your policy yet.

510
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,399
I had to borrow money to pay
for this coffin, Mr. Ted.

511
00:41:34,524 --> 00:41:36,526
Well, you're breaking
my heart, Mr. Barnell.

512
00:41:36,693 --> 00:41:37,986
I doubt that.

513
00:41:42,157 --> 00:41:45,827
They asked to see some personal
photos of Raymond.

514
00:41:48,246 --> 00:41:50,665
Guess this is gonna
be a really big story.

515
00:41:50,832 --> 00:41:52,501
Maybe if we walked
over there together

516
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:55,462
and you told them how deeply
moved you were by this tragedy.

517
00:41:55,629 --> 00:41:57,672
Enjoy your press conference,
Mr. Barnell.

518
00:42:22,906 --> 00:42:26,993
Raymond left us this shell. It's all
we have to remember him by, really.

519
00:42:57,232 --> 00:42:58,608
Hello, little Bambi.

520
00:43:01,737 --> 00:43:02,946
Where's your mommy?

521
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:07,576
Getting it from some ten-point buck.

522
00:43:09,578 --> 00:43:10,787
Yes, she is.

523
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,667
She is...

524
00:44:17,437 --> 00:44:19,439
Stay away from our
fucking appliances!

525
00:44:19,606 --> 00:44:21,775
Okay, lady, let's just stay calm.

526
00:44:49,344 --> 00:44:50,220
Sorry.

527
00:44:50,637 --> 00:44:52,723
Son of a bitch.

528
00:44:53,515 --> 00:44:55,559
You are in so much trouble!

529
00:44:55,934 --> 00:44:57,978
Lady, so help me...

530
00:45:02,441 --> 00:45:04,901
Let's go again.
Let's go... again.

531
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:08,488
Okay, sir...

532
00:45:09,322 --> 00:45:10,323
In the house!

533
00:45:22,794 --> 00:45:25,047
So you're a souvenir wholesaler?

534
00:45:25,213 --> 00:45:27,132
For the cruise ship trade, mostly.

535
00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:31,636
Usual stuff... stuffed animals.
You got your huskies, your moose

536
00:45:31,803 --> 00:45:33,680
your baby seals... your bears, your...

537
00:45:34,931 --> 00:45:36,183
Is that where they came in?

538
00:45:36,349 --> 00:45:39,061
Yeah, through that
big hole in the roof.

539
00:45:40,353 --> 00:45:42,689
I got a list of all the
things that are missing.

540
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:51,823
How much?

541
00:45:53,033 --> 00:45:54,993
We figure about two
hundred grand.

542
00:45:55,118 --> 00:45:56,745
Plus fixing the roof.

543
00:45:56,912 --> 00:45:59,247
Fax over an estimate and we'll
have you a check by Friday.

544
00:45:59,373 --> 00:46:03,210
Ted? Maybe we should take
a look at the irinventory list first.

545
00:46:03,377 --> 00:46:05,545
This is a simple case.
Bad guys stole stuff.

546
00:46:05,712 --> 00:46:07,422
Let's just clear it and
get going, okay?

547
00:46:07,547 --> 00:46:12,010
I should tell you, we also had some VCRs
we were holding for another company.

548
00:46:12,135 --> 00:46:14,096
That could run another
couple grand.

549
00:46:15,263 --> 00:46:18,850
Wanna wrap this up, Cam?
Gotta go primary sometime!

550
00:46:30,028 --> 00:46:33,156
You try to rape me,
I swear to Christ, I'll bite it off.

551
00:46:40,038 --> 00:46:41,331
Hey, what's going on?

552
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:43,834
- Don't ask! - What the hell
happened to your face?

553
00:46:43,959 --> 00:46:45,961
Jesus, you look like you ran into...

554
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:50,382
So what now, you gonna get me
smoking from both ends?

555
00:46:54,261 --> 00:46:56,471
I just came here to look around

556
00:46:56,638 --> 00:46:58,890
and she started hitting me
and yelling at me.

557
00:46:59,057 --> 00:46:59,766
Oh, please.

558
00:47:00,016 --> 00:47:01,560
Is this how you solve our problem?

559
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:04,146
I didn't have any choice.
Just listen to me, okay?

560
00:47:04,271 --> 00:47:07,232
Yeah, listen. If the fat from your
neck hasn't stopped up your ears.

561
00:47:14,281 --> 00:47:17,242
- Where would we stash her? Your place?
- No, it's too small.

562
00:47:17,409 --> 00:47:19,828
Plus, we'd have to get her in
and out without anyone seeing.

563
00:47:20,162 --> 00:47:22,456
And I've seen that sty
you call an apartment.

564
00:47:22,622 --> 00:47:25,250
You see, it's a bad idea.

565
00:47:31,214 --> 00:47:33,258
They got a whirlpool tub.

566
00:47:35,969 --> 00:47:37,304
With bubbles?

567
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:39,473
It'd be like a little getaway.

568
00:47:53,528 --> 00:47:57,157
Hey Maggie Magster.
You're awfully...

569
00:47:58,575 --> 00:47:59,826
What the hell happened?

570
00:48:02,037 --> 00:48:03,455
What the hell are you
doing in our house?

571
00:48:03,622 --> 00:48:04,873
Mr. Barnell.

572
00:48:05,457 --> 00:48:08,126
I believe you have something
that belongs to us.

573
00:48:10,045 --> 00:48:11,630
I don't know what
you're talking about.

574
00:48:11,797 --> 00:48:12,631
You don't?

575
00:48:13,256 --> 00:48:16,510
You hear that, Gary? He don't
know what we're talking about.

576
00:48:19,012 --> 00:48:20,806
Guess he doesn't know
nothing about a...

577
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:24,017
dead body in the dumpster
at his place of employment.

578
00:48:27,854 --> 00:48:29,356
So how much did you get?

579
00:48:33,318 --> 00:48:36,738
We had a life insurance policy
on my brother

580
00:48:36,905 --> 00:48:39,699
and we could get...

581
00:48:39,866 --> 00:48:41,993
one hundred thousand dollars.

582
00:48:44,996 --> 00:48:48,542
You know, it's always
you quiet guys.

583
00:48:52,087 --> 00:48:55,382
All right, here's how
it's gonna work.

584
00:48:56,174 --> 00:48:58,885
We stay here with your
little tulip in there

585
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:00,679
and you go get our guy.

586
00:49:02,514 --> 00:49:04,349
You stay here?

587
00:49:04,516 --> 00:49:08,061
Have the body
and let's say

588
00:49:09,396 --> 00:49:12,691
fifty thousand clams
for our trouble.

589
00:49:12,941 --> 00:49:17,154
You screw with us and we'll start
mailing your wife back to you.

590
00:49:23,285 --> 00:49:25,203
Starting with her feet.

591
00:49:45,891 --> 00:49:48,935
Paul! Are you moving in?

592
00:49:49,561 --> 00:49:51,021
Just for a bit.

593
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:53,315
She'll come to her senses.

594
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,941
They always do.

595
00:49:56,318 --> 00:49:57,861
Thanks, Mrs. Wherry.

596
00:50:00,155 --> 00:50:01,114
Good night.

597
00:50:18,465 --> 00:50:19,716
Oh, Raymond.

598
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:23,220
Would it have killed you
to clean up before you left?

599
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,977
State police! Open up!

600
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:14,521
Police? Is there something wrong?

601
00:51:25,741 --> 00:51:28,410
Hello, brother. Missed ya.

602
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:34,583
Page sixteen, Paul.

603
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:37,961
You know what I love
about USA Today,

604
00:51:38,086 --> 00:51:42,257
other than the bar graphs
and the colored pictures?

605
00:51:42,424 --> 00:51:45,927
They got news from every
state in the Union.

606
00:51:46,678 --> 00:51:50,223
I was eaten by wild
fucking animals!

607
00:51:51,016 --> 00:51:55,645
But you know, despite that,
I'm feeling pretty goddamn chipper.

608
00:51:55,896 --> 00:51:58,315
Let me tell you what's
going on here, Raymond.

609
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:02,903
So where's my money?

610
00:52:03,028 --> 00:52:07,074
Your money? There's no money yet.
They're still investigating.

611
00:52:07,449 --> 00:52:08,575
What'd you get?

612
00:52:09,368 --> 00:52:10,827
Fifty thousand.

613
00:52:11,286 --> 00:52:12,788
I get half.

614
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:13,997
Sure.

615
00:52:16,917 --> 00:52:18,919
You look good.
You lost weight.

616
00:52:19,419 --> 00:52:21,630
I gave up carbs.

617
00:52:22,547 --> 00:52:26,176
I'm getting a health kick.

618
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:31,890
What you doing out here, anyway?

619
00:52:33,266 --> 00:52:34,726
She not going along with it?

620
00:52:35,268 --> 00:52:36,812
Who, Margaret?

621
00:52:37,938 --> 00:52:40,273
How's she holding up, anyway?

622
00:52:41,316 --> 00:52:42,943
We're having problems.

623
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,987
Any kids?

624
00:52:47,322 --> 00:52:50,450
You still can't get one
past the goalie, huh?

625
00:52:52,994 --> 00:52:57,916
Well, it's best not to send
a boy to do a man's job.

626
00:53:00,001 --> 00:53:01,962
So how come you
talk like you do?

627
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:04,965
I mean, cursing
all the time.

628
00:53:05,298 --> 00:53:07,718
It's a disease. It's called
Tourette's Syndrome.

629
00:53:07,843 --> 00:53:11,096
I can't control what I say.
Turnip.

630
00:53:12,097 --> 00:53:13,014
Really?

631
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,224
Congratulations.

632
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:17,477
You've just kidnapped
a handicapped person.

633
00:53:17,811 --> 00:53:22,315
I saw on TV where people
with that don't usually curse.

634
00:53:22,524 --> 00:53:23,900
They must have got it wrong.

635
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:25,193
I don't think so.

636
00:53:25,318 --> 00:53:28,363
It was a movie of the week
based on real events.

637
00:53:29,281 --> 00:53:32,451
And don't people with Tourette's
usually twitch and stuff?

638
00:53:36,747 --> 00:53:39,332
I get it. Sorry.
You got a spice rack?

639
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:44,629
Next to the stove.
What's that supposed to mean?

640
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:46,298
Nothing. Cumin?

641
00:53:47,716 --> 00:53:49,801
There. There. There.

642
00:53:49,968 --> 00:53:54,139
There, there, there,
there, there, there!

643
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:58,018
And I'm not crazy.
It's a physical disease.

644
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:00,062
Sometimes I can control it,
and sometimes... I can't.

645
00:54:00,228 --> 00:54:03,065
You can't. You know what I think?

646
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:07,652
I think this syndrome is something you
read about somewhere and figured...

647
00:54:07,778 --> 00:54:09,696
"Hey, works for me. "

648
00:54:09,863 --> 00:54:11,239
Ass. Ass. Ass.

649
00:54:11,364 --> 00:54:14,868
You can completely abdicate
your societal responsibilities.

650
00:54:14,993 --> 00:54:18,205
Say whatever want whenever you want,
and slough it off on an illness.

651
00:54:18,372 --> 00:54:19,623
Ass-rimming ball sucker.

652
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,666
Maybe I should catch this thing.

653
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:23,502
"Gee, sorry, Your Honor,

654
00:54:23,668 --> 00:54:26,088
I have this disease that makes me
rob 7-Elevens.

655
00:54:26,213 --> 00:54:28,465
It's called I really need
a Slurpee disease. "

656
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:32,219
You've never robbed a 7-11 in your
life you shit-eating fuck-weasel.

657
00:54:32,386 --> 00:54:34,888
What kind of a man threatens
a woman with a gun, anyway?

658
00:54:35,055 --> 00:54:36,890
You are so faking it.

659
00:54:37,057 --> 00:54:38,350
You should know.

660
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:40,977
Is this how you get your kicks,

661
00:54:41,144 --> 00:54:44,272
you overcompensating
pussy little fart sack?

662
00:54:44,439 --> 00:54:48,527
You better shut your mouth or I'm
gonna stick this gun right in it!

663
00:54:48,693 --> 00:54:50,570
You don't scare me. If something
bad was gonna happen,

664
00:54:50,695 --> 00:54:52,197
my psychic would have told me.

665
00:54:53,907 --> 00:54:55,784
You put that down now,
you little bitch,

666
00:54:56,118 --> 00:54:59,621
or so help me I'll start yelling
so loud, you'll have to shoot me.

667
00:55:13,635 --> 00:55:14,970
A little help here?

668
00:55:17,806 --> 00:55:19,182
I got Twinkies.

669
00:55:29,276 --> 00:55:30,193
Honey?

670
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,405
You okay?

671
00:55:33,989 --> 00:55:37,325
Wait, this is the important part.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

672
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:39,453
This stops now.

673
00:55:39,619 --> 00:55:40,328
I was watching that.

674
00:55:40,495 --> 00:55:43,165
This case is making
me and you crazy.

675
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:44,416
Especially you.

676
00:55:47,002 --> 00:55:49,254
I'm just trying to be supportive.

677
00:55:49,796 --> 00:55:53,925
Leading experts agree that's the number
one complaint men had about their mates.

678
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:57,846
I don't have any complaints
about my, you.

679
00:56:00,474 --> 00:56:01,850
Dead guy's got a record?

680
00:56:01,975 --> 00:56:04,853
Yeah, he beat some guy
up in a bar fight.

681
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,980
He broke the guy's eye socket.

682
00:56:13,862 --> 00:56:15,322
- Honey?
- Yeah.

683
00:56:15,447 --> 00:56:17,365
- I think you should look
at this again. - Okay.

684
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:36,927
You know, I've been
thinking there, Paulie.

685
00:56:39,054 --> 00:56:42,766
After we get her back from
these guys who grabbed her

686
00:56:42,933 --> 00:56:46,311
do you think your wife's
gonna be able to keep her

687
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:48,355
pretty little mouth shut?

688
00:56:48,522 --> 00:56:50,273
That'd be a first.

689
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:53,777
'Cause, you know,
crazy people talk a lot and...

690
00:56:53,944 --> 00:56:55,278
- She's not...
... and I'm told that

691
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:59,324
if you say something to your therapist,
they can use that in a courtroom.

692
00:56:59,491 --> 00:57:01,284
We can't afford a therapist,
Raymond.

693
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:05,122
Still, you just might
want to think about it.

694
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:07,666
Think about what?

695
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:10,210
All I'm saying is,

696
00:57:10,335 --> 00:57:13,964
sometimes a man has to
make problematic decisions.

697
00:57:14,131 --> 00:57:17,843
Cull the herd, so to speak.

698
00:57:25,183 --> 00:57:28,645
Come on, Paulie, I'm just
I'm just fuckin' with you.

699
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:30,272
Don't be such a stick.

700
00:57:30,439 --> 00:57:32,566
Is that jailhouse humor?

701
00:57:34,526 --> 00:57:36,278
Still...

702
00:57:53,712 --> 00:57:54,504
Mr. Watters.

703
00:57:55,088 --> 00:57:58,467
On the phone you said something
about a resolution to our claim?

704
00:57:58,633 --> 00:58:00,635
Mr. Barnell, why are
you staying out here?

705
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:06,600
My wife and I we're having
a few problems.

706
00:58:06,767 --> 00:58:09,269
Well, that's kind of understandable,
seeing as how you killed that man

707
00:58:09,436 --> 00:58:11,563
and dumped his body out
in the middle of the woods.

708
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:12,522
Raymond?

709
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:13,774
No, no, no.

710
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:14,941
Definitely not Raymond.

711
00:58:15,108 --> 00:58:18,320
I thought it was at first,
but that's what was throwing me.

712
00:58:18,487 --> 00:58:20,489
I don't think I appreciate
your tone, sir.

713
00:58:20,655 --> 00:58:25,827
My tone?
Mr. Barnell, you are going to jail.

714
00:58:25,994 --> 00:58:27,162
I will personally see to that.

715
00:58:27,329 --> 00:58:28,246
I think you should go now.

716
00:58:28,413 --> 00:58:31,124
You are a liar and a thief!

717
00:58:31,249 --> 00:58:33,290
- Mr. Watters, I've had a very
rough night. - Murderer. - No.

718
00:58:33,293 --> 00:58:34,795
You are a murderer.

719
00:58:42,511 --> 00:58:44,096
What happened to your eye?

720
00:58:45,389 --> 00:58:47,766
Let's say you just step
away from him.

721
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:53,522
You all right there, Paul?

722
00:58:54,022 --> 00:58:56,233
I'm all right, Mrs. Wherry.
It's okay.

723
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,652
I can drop him, if you want.

724
00:58:58,819 --> 00:59:01,071
No. I'm all right.

725
00:59:03,865 --> 00:59:06,827
I think you should go.
She can't hold the bow that long.

726
00:59:18,296 --> 00:59:21,425
I got some fishing line,
if you want me to stitch that.

727
00:59:25,554 --> 00:59:26,513
You okay?

728
00:59:27,514 --> 00:59:31,143
Yeah. I'm great.

729
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:37,274
I haven't called the police yet,

730
00:59:37,816 --> 00:59:40,068
but I can tell you it
was certainly tempting.

731
00:59:40,736 --> 00:59:45,657
In my life, I've had dealings
with diseases of the mind and...

732
00:59:46,575 --> 00:59:48,702
he is definitely disturbed.

733
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:52,664
Watters, it's so good
of you to join us.

734
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:56,710
Mr. Barnell was just telling me
about the last meeting you had.

735
00:59:58,170 --> 00:59:59,588
I caught that, yeah.

736
00:59:59,713 --> 01:00:04,051
And, as you can see,
Mr. Barnell has some concerns.

737
01:00:06,303 --> 01:00:08,555
You don't think I did this.

738
01:00:12,267 --> 01:00:17,105
- I would never...
- His neighbor says otherwise.

739
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:23,195
Mr. Branch, can I show
you something?

740
01:00:23,361 --> 01:00:26,239
I think you would like to see it, too,
Mr. Barnell.

741
01:00:29,534 --> 01:00:32,496
Okay, see?
Where's the birthmark?

742
01:00:33,246 --> 01:00:34,289
Your brother's police
report listed,

743
01:00:34,456 --> 01:00:36,249
"large, purple birthmark,
upper right thigh".

744
01:00:36,416 --> 01:00:38,168
But I don't see it here,
not on this body.

745
01:00:38,335 --> 01:00:42,589
You can-you can see it here,
in the-in the picture. See?

746
01:00:43,298 --> 01:00:45,384
So where did it go?

747
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:49,304
Did it just disappear? Did it all of
a sudden get better, Mr. Barnell?

748
01:00:57,729 --> 01:00:59,981
It did get better, Mr. Watters.

749
01:01:00,148 --> 01:01:01,316
It did?

750
01:01:01,483 --> 01:01:02,734
It got better!

751
01:01:03,527 --> 01:01:06,029
Well, how in the world
did that happen?

752
01:01:06,904 --> 01:01:08,365
Well...

753
01:01:10,096 --> 01:01:14,710
Raymond, when he came back
from Florida, he'd had it fixed.

754
01:01:16,081 --> 01:01:20,335
Laser surgery. Yeah, how like
you remove a tattoo.

755
01:01:20,794 --> 01:01:21,962
I understand.

756
01:01:22,129 --> 01:01:23,714
And it gone.

757
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:29,886
He did... not!
No! He didn't!

758
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:30,762
What do you mean?
Did not.

759
01:01:30,929 --> 01:01:33,974
How can you tell?
There's no leg!

760
01:01:34,099 --> 01:01:39,563
You taped my brother's body
in a morgue. And this! What's this?

761
01:01:39,813 --> 01:01:41,982
You stole family pictures!

762
01:01:42,149 --> 01:01:46,403
You videotaped the naked chewed
corpse of my little brother!

763
01:01:46,528 --> 01:01:49,322
What the kind of sick company
are you running here, sir?

764
01:01:49,489 --> 01:01:52,701
This is crazy! This is crazy!

765
01:01:52,826 --> 01:01:56,371
All we have to do is dig up the
body I'm not talking to you!

766
01:01:56,496 --> 01:01:59,750
Dig up the body and check
for laser scars! Dental records!

767
01:02:00,792 --> 01:02:05,881
- All right. All right!
- All right. All right!

768
01:02:09,551 --> 01:02:14,556
Mr. Barnell, I'm so very sorry
that it's come to this.

769
01:02:15,974 --> 01:02:19,102
We will have a check brought to
you first thing in the morning.

770
01:02:24,608 --> 01:02:25,609
Thank you.

771
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:43,960
Jesus.
Thank God he's not suing us.

772
01:02:44,878 --> 01:02:48,465
Tomorrow, you will deliver
a check to Mr. Barnell

773
01:02:48,632 --> 01:02:51,259
with a complete apology.

774
01:02:53,261 --> 01:02:55,972
Mr. Branch, I know how this looks...

775
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:59,518
It looks like you beat hell
out of a policy holder!

776
01:02:59,643 --> 01:03:01,228
Now, send Cam in here.

777
01:03:01,353 --> 01:03:04,064
While you've been out on
your little Easter egg hunt,

778
01:03:04,231 --> 01:03:08,235
your junior found us a way out
on that warehouse robbery.

779
01:03:08,735 --> 01:03:11,780
Head Office is going
to bump him a level.

780
01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:17,411
I'll go get him.

781
01:03:19,496 --> 01:03:22,124
Head Office is very keen on him.

782
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:26,586
They've asked me to feel
him out about a transfer.

783
01:03:29,756 --> 01:03:33,051
County Coroner.
It's a Disinterment Order.

784
01:03:33,593 --> 01:03:36,388
Hello. Yes, I was wondering
if you could tell me

785
01:03:36,555 --> 01:03:39,057
which department
is in charge of...

786
01:03:40,726 --> 01:03:41,893
Sure, I'll hold.

787
01:03:42,769 --> 01:03:44,896
Hang on, Mag Pie. Hang on.

788
01:04:09,838 --> 01:04:13,550
Listen, you little prick!
We want what's coming to us!

789
01:04:20,015 --> 01:04:21,183
I know you are, but what am I?

790
01:04:21,349 --> 01:04:22,350
Gary!

791
01:04:23,957 --> 01:04:25,788
- Gary!
- Your turn to deal with it!

792
01:04:25,823 --> 01:04:27,230
If I come out of
this bathroom,

793
01:04:27,397 --> 01:04:29,816
I swear to God I'll put a
fucking bullet in her head!

794
01:04:29,983 --> 01:04:31,902
I know you are, but what am I?

795
01:04:32,903 --> 01:04:36,281
Ray. Can I talk to
you for a moment?

796
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:38,325
Ladies.

797
01:04:38,492 --> 01:04:39,368
Ladies.

798
01:04:43,955 --> 01:04:44,915
Listen, who's...?

799
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:46,041
The prostitutes?

800
01:04:46,208 --> 01:04:48,043
I sure as hell hope so.

801
01:04:48,168 --> 01:04:52,089
'Cause Jehovah's Witness won't lick your
lolly no matter how much you pay them.

802
01:04:52,506 --> 01:04:53,715
How'd you get them here?

803
01:04:53,882 --> 01:04:57,010
I just put it on my plastic.

804
01:04:57,135 --> 01:05:01,223
It's got my name on it and everything.
"It's everywhere that we want to be. "

805
01:05:01,473 --> 01:05:04,101
You can't use this.

806
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:07,312
No, no, no. Think.
Okay? Ray?

807
01:05:08,146 --> 01:05:09,815
You're not using your head, Raymond.

808
01:05:09,981 --> 01:05:12,484
The fuck you say.

809
01:05:17,698 --> 01:05:20,117
What in blazes is that
on the counter, Ray?

810
01:05:20,325 --> 01:05:23,036
That's "muh gun", Paul.

811
01:05:28,709 --> 01:05:29,418
Hello?

812
01:05:29,543 --> 01:05:32,337
Hello, Mr. Barnell.
It's Jimbo.

813
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:33,672
Sorry, I can't...

814
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:35,507
Are you having a party?

815
01:05:35,799 --> 01:05:38,844
There's no party.
Put my wife on the phone.

816
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:40,804
- Sir, that's not right.
- Now! Please.

817
01:05:40,971 --> 01:05:44,516
- Thirty, sorry, starting now!
- I have to talk to my wife.

818
01:05:44,933 --> 01:05:48,395
Well, he wants to talk to her.
Okay, hold on.

819
01:05:48,562 --> 01:05:49,271
Twenty-five!

820
01:05:49,438 --> 01:05:50,939
Paul, are you entertaining?

821
01:05:51,106 --> 01:05:53,900
Oh, Margaret, no!
Oh, God, Jesus, are you all right?

822
01:05:54,067 --> 01:05:56,111
Fifteen! Have you got the body?

823
01:05:56,278 --> 01:05:57,446
Paul, we need more chips!

824
01:05:57,612 --> 01:05:58,488
Have you got the body?

825
01:05:58,655 --> 01:06:00,991
Paul, the carrot little weasely one
wants to carrot screw me with

826
01:06:01,281 --> 01:06:03,164
his sick carrot little cock.
And he's messing up my kitchen.

827
01:06:03,438 --> 01:06:06,023
- Cock, cock, cock, cock...
- You sick... you don't hurt her!

828
01:06:06,058 --> 01:06:09,708
I didn't say anything like that.
I didn't. Ten seconds! Yes or no?

829
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:11,126
Paul, where's the chips?

830
01:06:12,544 --> 01:06:16,548
Yes. You'll have it tomorrow.
Now put my wife back...

831
01:06:18,561 --> 01:06:19,736
Hello!

832
01:06:19,771 --> 01:06:21,762
I think I managed
to avoid a trace.

833
01:06:22,804 --> 01:06:25,015
We're staying in his house.

834
01:06:27,392 --> 01:06:28,310
Right.

835
01:06:29,311 --> 01:06:31,438
Hello! Can I help you?

836
01:06:32,647 --> 01:06:33,648
Mr. Watters.

837
01:06:34,191 --> 01:06:37,360
Mr. Barnell, I...

838
01:06:37,694 --> 01:06:39,905
I have your check.

839
01:06:40,822 --> 01:06:41,615
Really?

840
01:06:42,115 --> 01:06:42,991
Yeah.

841
01:06:44,701 --> 01:06:48,372
Thank you very much.
I appreciate that. Please sit.

842
01:06:48,622 --> 01:06:49,498
Avis.

843
01:06:59,633 --> 01:07:00,759
Did you have an accident?

844
01:07:01,301 --> 01:07:03,762
Well, no, actually I was mugged.

845
01:07:04,262 --> 01:07:07,849
The police say it was just
a random act of violence,

846
01:07:08,016 --> 01:07:10,394
but who knows, right?

847
01:07:15,148 --> 01:07:19,903
I have to get you to sign right here
where I marked

848
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:24,658
an X. And...

849
01:07:26,243 --> 01:07:29,204
I'd like to apologize for...

850
01:07:29,371 --> 01:07:31,998
No. No, please. No need.

851
01:07:37,838 --> 01:07:39,589
Well, that's quite the shell.

852
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:42,426
It's a gift from my brother, Raymond.

853
01:07:43,093 --> 01:07:47,347
He brought it back from Florida for me,
and now it's all I have to remember him by.

854
01:07:48,682 --> 01:07:50,684
Well, that and a million dollars.

855
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:56,106
Boy, things really worked out
for you this time, didn't they?

856
01:07:56,273 --> 01:07:58,608
- Lots of cash. Newly single guy...
- I'm not single.

857
01:07:58,775 --> 01:07:59,901
Well, what are you gonna do?

858
01:08:00,068 --> 01:08:02,070
You gonna go down to Club Med and
see how much a big bankroll can buy?

859
01:08:02,237 --> 01:08:03,030
Maybe get some hookers?

860
01:08:03,196 --> 01:08:05,115
I love my wife, Mr. Watters.

861
01:08:07,784 --> 01:08:08,910
Very much.

862
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,682
Can we level with each
other for a moment?

863
01:08:16,228 --> 01:08:20,892
- How... how did...
- Avis!

864
01:08:23,842 --> 01:08:24,676
Avis!

865
01:08:28,055 --> 01:08:29,264
I got it.

866
01:08:29,681 --> 01:08:31,016
A second.
Thank you.

867
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:42,069
That's where you went!

868
01:08:50,619 --> 01:08:52,287
That's quite the display.

869
01:08:52,871 --> 01:08:55,749
They do some very nice
in-store promotions.

870
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,835
Here it is, Mr. Barnell.

871
01:08:59,086 --> 01:09:01,588
I thought someone might
have walked out with it.

872
01:09:01,755 --> 01:09:03,340
It's not the best neighborhood.

873
01:09:10,555 --> 01:09:13,350
Sign right by the X.

874
01:09:32,494 --> 01:09:35,706
Avis, will you call Municipal
Light and Power

875
01:09:35,872 --> 01:09:38,333
and tell them I'll be
dropping by in a bit?

876
01:09:42,713 --> 01:09:43,588
Thank you.

877
01:10:08,655 --> 01:10:10,574
There's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

878
01:10:10,741 --> 01:10:14,745
A lot of people find talking
to a psychic very therapeutic.

879
01:10:15,203 --> 01:10:17,289
So what's on your mind, Carlos?

880
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:21,626
I have a situation.
My wife...

881
01:10:23,462 --> 01:10:27,215
Do you think it's okay to do
something kinda bad to someone

882
01:10:27,632 --> 01:10:33,013
even though they may do something
to someone else that's really bad?

883
01:10:34,014 --> 01:10:38,351
Well, you probably shouldn't break
the law, if you can help it.

884
01:10:38,477 --> 01:10:41,938
Are you really sure they're
gonna do this other thing?

885
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:46,318
He said some things.
He said he was joking,

886
01:10:46,443 --> 01:10:49,738
but I think he might do them.

887
01:10:49,905 --> 01:10:52,699
Okay, well, don't think, know.

888
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:54,868
How close are you to this
other someone else,

889
01:10:55,035 --> 01:10:56,620
the one you're trying to protect?

890
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:04,044
Have you ever felt like

891
01:11:05,379 --> 01:11:07,714
like your own life
didn't even matter

892
01:11:08,924 --> 01:11:10,759
as long as

893
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:13,553
Listen to me Carlos.

894
01:11:13,678 --> 01:11:17,557
Your wife is an incredibly
lucky woman.

895
01:11:17,724 --> 01:11:19,393
I know relationships
are tough,

896
01:11:19,559 --> 01:11:23,397
but you you just do what you
gotta do to keep it together, okay?

897
01:11:23,814 --> 01:11:27,484
Remember, love is sacrifice.

898
01:11:34,616 --> 01:11:36,034
I guess you're right.

899
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,454
Okay, so you get tough, all right?

900
01:11:39,871 --> 01:11:43,208
And remember, this call is
for entertainment purposes only.

901
01:11:43,625 --> 01:11:46,086
But call me back and let me know
how it goes, okay?

902
01:11:46,503 --> 01:11:48,338
- Okay.
- All right.

903
01:11:58,118 --> 01:11:59,408
Okay.

904
01:13:07,626 --> 01:13:11,630
So, Miami, huh?
Can you believe that?

905
01:13:11,755 --> 01:13:14,299
One little case and, boom,
you're the flavor of the month.

906
01:13:14,925 --> 01:13:17,969
Congratulations.
Why are you here?

907
01:13:18,095 --> 01:13:21,056
To say thanks. If you hadn't
given me a shot on that...

908
01:13:21,223 --> 01:13:24,017
Oh, no, no, no.
Forget about it. I'm trying to.

909
01:13:24,601 --> 01:13:28,271
So, we were all kinda wondering,
what did happen to your face?

910
01:13:28,688 --> 01:13:29,815
Car trouble.

911
01:13:32,693 --> 01:13:33,568
Should you be driving?

912
01:13:33,735 --> 01:13:34,736
Absolutely not.

913
01:14:07,436 --> 01:14:08,270
Jodie!

914
01:14:20,699 --> 01:14:22,367
We set for the switch tomorrow?

915
01:14:22,492 --> 01:14:23,410
Yeah.

916
01:14:23,577 --> 01:14:27,414
There's a turnout up at Summit
Hill where the snowmobilers park.

917
01:14:27,581 --> 01:14:28,999
Fine.

918
01:14:38,884 --> 01:14:40,635
You guys like it?

919
01:14:43,805 --> 01:14:45,474
Tastes like a rectal polyp.

920
01:14:50,479 --> 01:14:52,856
Now, how would she know?

921
01:14:56,568 --> 01:14:58,070
How would she know?

922
01:15:00,822 --> 01:15:02,240
How would she know?

923
01:15:02,824 --> 01:15:06,703
I coulda had her, you know?
We both know that.

924
01:15:07,662 --> 01:15:08,538
Right?

925
01:15:13,877 --> 01:15:17,881
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I just figured she was...

926
01:15:18,298 --> 01:15:22,803
I don't know. You know?
'Cause I... You know?

927
01:15:22,928 --> 01:15:24,346
No, I don't know.

928
01:15:24,763 --> 01:15:27,015
- Okay.
- You ready for a refill?

929
01:15:27,182 --> 01:15:29,601
Does Mrs. Kennedy
have a black dress?

930
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:35,065
- Alrighty.
- Comin' up.

931
01:15:39,695 --> 01:15:42,572
So, rendezvous at the
glacier tomorrow, huh?

932
01:15:42,698 --> 01:15:45,033
First thing in the morning.

933
01:15:47,536 --> 01:15:51,206
Yeah, well, we'll go get her
and do the thing, and...

934
01:15:54,459 --> 01:15:57,671
You remember that
time in school

935
01:15:57,838 --> 01:16:02,259
when I jumped out and scared you
and you fucking peed all over yourself?

936
01:16:02,384 --> 01:16:03,969
That was a hoot, yeah.

937
01:16:05,095 --> 01:16:06,513
Hey, bottoms up.

938
01:16:07,347 --> 01:16:10,052
Okay.
Puddles!

939
01:16:11,087 --> 01:16:14,259
- You remember how everybody
called you "Puddles"? - Yeah.

940
01:16:14,271 --> 01:16:16,231
Everybody called you "Puddles".

941
01:16:16,398 --> 01:16:17,399
They did.

942
01:16:18,191 --> 01:16:18,984
Puddles!

943
01:16:19,151 --> 01:16:20,652
Yeah, that was funny.

944
01:16:21,945 --> 01:16:23,613
Hey, come on now.

945
01:16:23,905 --> 01:16:26,450
There you go, there you go.

946
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:32,205
I love you, bro.

947
01:16:32,372 --> 01:16:33,582
You too, pal.

948
01:16:35,542 --> 01:16:36,334
Okay.

949
01:18:33,493 --> 01:18:35,078
It's my tub!
Open up!

950
01:18:35,245 --> 01:18:36,121
Finders keepers.

951
01:18:36,288 --> 01:18:37,956
No, I drew the water!
Get out!

952
01:18:38,123 --> 01:18:40,125
- Finders keepers.
- Get out of here.

953
01:18:40,834 --> 01:18:42,836
You know this thing has twelve
different settings?

954
01:18:43,003 --> 01:18:47,340
No, Gary I don't. Every time I try to get
in it, somebody else is already there.

955
01:18:47,507 --> 01:18:49,092
Stop that!

956
01:18:49,676 --> 01:18:51,970
Hey, let me ask you something.
Does this look normal?

957
01:18:52,137 --> 01:18:53,472
Oh, Christ!

958
01:18:53,597 --> 01:18:56,308
I read that if it changes color,
you should have it looked at.

959
01:18:56,433 --> 01:18:58,185
Yeah... but not by me!

960
01:19:11,239 --> 01:19:11,948
Hello?

961
01:19:12,074 --> 01:19:14,242
Oh, thank fucking Christ!
Is Tiffany there?

962
01:19:14,493 --> 01:19:17,704
No, well, she's gonna be
back in a couple of minutes.

963
01:19:17,871 --> 01:19:19,539
Do you want to call back later?

964
01:19:19,706 --> 01:19:20,957
Well, you should know, fuckwit.

965
01:19:21,124 --> 01:19:23,543
Do you know there's a man with
a gun in my bathroom right now?

966
01:19:23,710 --> 01:19:24,961
Goddammit, Ted.

967
01:19:25,128 --> 01:19:28,173
Oh, wait, yeah, she's right here.
One second.

968
01:19:28,590 --> 01:19:29,925
Mrs. Barnell?

969
01:19:31,927 --> 01:19:33,845
I'm here, Margaret.
How're you feeling today?

970
01:19:34,012 --> 01:19:34,805
Give me the headset.

971
01:19:34,930 --> 01:19:36,515
What is wrong with you?

972
01:19:36,681 --> 01:19:38,600
Christ! Where do
you want to start?

973
01:19:38,725 --> 01:19:40,894
Mrs. Barnell could
you speak up a bit?

974
01:19:41,061 --> 01:19:42,145
What's she saying?

975
01:19:42,312 --> 01:19:45,691
Something about the Gay Mafia
taking her to a park to kill her?

976
01:19:46,525 --> 01:19:50,195
Margaret, now are you sure that
these are real people in your house?

977
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:52,614
Shit on toast.

978
01:19:53,824 --> 01:19:55,909
Jesus!
Fucking dog.

979
01:19:56,076 --> 01:19:57,744
Watch out for Jodie.

980
01:19:59,204 --> 01:20:01,540
How do you like the bubbles now?

981
01:20:01,707 --> 01:20:03,458
You want to squeak
your duck again?

982
01:20:05,085 --> 01:20:05,877
Jesus!

983
01:20:10,716 --> 01:20:12,759
- That really hurts, you know?
- Good!

984
01:20:19,808 --> 01:20:21,226
Why are the flowers talking?

985
01:20:25,772 --> 01:20:26,732
Are you sure this is it?

986
01:20:26,898 --> 01:20:29,526
She specifically mentioned the
cocksucking turnout off the highway

987
01:20:29,651 --> 01:20:31,778
where the snowmobilers
like to hang out.

988
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,448
I'll call you later, okay?

989
01:20:35,365 --> 01:20:36,950
I won't be here.

990
01:20:37,117 --> 01:20:37,826
Excuse me?

991
01:20:39,244 --> 01:20:42,289
I know relationships aren't gonna
be all sunshine and roses,

992
01:20:42,456 --> 01:20:44,624
but I'm not really having
that much fun anymore,

993
01:20:44,791 --> 01:20:46,543
and I don't think you are, either.

994
01:20:47,335 --> 01:20:48,670
What are you talking about?

995
01:20:49,046 --> 01:20:51,298
I just I think you need to be
like this right now,

996
01:20:51,465 --> 01:20:54,092
and I'm not in a good
space to deal with it.

997
01:20:56,386 --> 01:20:57,304
So, what?

998
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:03,435
I just, I don't think we should
be like this together.

999
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:41,973
Psychic Pals.

1000
01:21:43,934 --> 01:21:46,019
How are you today, Mr. Williams?

1001
01:21:48,605 --> 01:21:51,233
I think she'd be fine
with you re-marrying.

1002
01:21:54,319 --> 01:21:56,238
But hang on,
let me concentrate...

1003
01:22:05,414 --> 01:22:07,624
I've been... I've been cutting
you out of my life

1004
01:22:08,542 --> 01:22:13,046
and, as a result, our normal communication
channels have been blocked.

1005
01:22:13,213 --> 01:22:15,215
And I think that
you coming with me

1006
01:22:15,716 --> 01:22:18,844
would further the development
of our relationship

1007
01:22:19,136 --> 01:22:22,597
and allow us both
to realize the...

1008
01:22:22,764 --> 01:22:26,184
the potential of our
interpersonalism.

1009
01:22:26,435 --> 01:22:28,603
If you're gonna be sarcastic...

1010
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:30,439
I'm not being anything.

1011
01:22:35,902 --> 01:22:38,530
Okay. Why do you
want me to come?

1012
01:22:41,867 --> 01:22:43,118
Because if you don't,

1013
01:22:44,077 --> 01:22:46,955
then... then I'll have to stay.

1014
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:51,501
And then, then I'll
be mad about that.

1015
01:22:54,796 --> 01:22:56,715
And then, and then I know that

1016
01:22:56,965 --> 01:22:59,176
we'll eventually
break up over it.

1017
01:23:04,765 --> 01:23:06,892
And as bad as my life
is right now, Tiffany,

1018
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:08,977
that would make it a
million times worse.

1019
01:23:18,153 --> 01:23:19,488
Mr. Williams?

1020
01:23:20,197 --> 01:23:22,157
You know,
she's totally cool with it.

1021
01:23:22,324 --> 01:23:25,202
Listen, listen, you're gonna
have to call back.

1022
01:23:25,786 --> 01:23:27,829
I gotta go help my boyfriend.

1023
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:52,789
See this? This has all the symptoms
of that Tourette's thing...

1024
01:24:52,998 --> 01:24:55,155
- and you don't have half of them.
- And?

1025
01:24:55,417 --> 01:24:57,627
And... and you're faking it.

1026
01:24:57,794 --> 01:24:59,504
Magazines don't prove anything.

1027
01:24:59,671 --> 01:25:02,049
Could we please get there
e in some peace and quiet?

1028
01:25:02,215 --> 01:25:03,967
Magazines prove everything.

1029
01:25:04,092 --> 01:25:05,844
Don't make me pull
the car over.

1030
01:25:14,936 --> 01:25:16,772
Okay, so it's called
The Listening Game.

1031
01:25:16,938 --> 01:25:20,275
You talk, I listen, and I can't interrupt.
Then we switch.

1032
01:25:20,734 --> 01:25:22,069
I can talk about anything?

1033
01:25:23,403 --> 01:25:24,404
Yes.

1034
01:25:25,113 --> 01:25:26,948
Let's just drop it, okay?

1035
01:25:27,115 --> 01:25:30,786
I'm just saying, she acts like this
'cause you always take her side!

1036
01:25:36,583 --> 01:25:38,710
That little prick!

1037
01:26:11,326 --> 01:26:13,078
I assume you have our friend?

1038
01:26:13,203 --> 01:26:15,580
Of course.
Can you let her go now?

1039
01:26:16,039 --> 01:26:17,666
Let's see our guy first.

1040
01:26:23,004 --> 01:26:24,005
How do we know it's him?

1041
01:26:24,172 --> 01:26:26,049
Come on!
Where would I get another one?

1042
01:26:27,426 --> 01:26:28,760
You got the money, Mack?

1043
01:26:33,765 --> 01:26:36,643
So, this is kinda like a really weird
"Law and Order" episode.

1044
01:26:36,768 --> 01:26:38,729
And if Paul Barnell already
killed his brother...

1045
01:26:38,937 --> 01:26:40,522
Yeah, maybe his wife is next.

1046
01:26:43,775 --> 01:26:45,277
Okay, so my turn?

1047
01:26:45,402 --> 01:26:46,153
Yeah.

1048
01:26:46,319 --> 01:26:47,571
Now, a healthy relationship...

1049
01:26:47,738 --> 01:26:48,822
Here we are.

1050
01:26:56,163 --> 01:26:56,997
Can I let her out?

1051
01:26:57,205 --> 01:26:59,499
No! Step away from the car!

1052
01:27:12,804 --> 01:27:13,889
Why did you gag her?

1053
01:27:15,599 --> 01:27:16,683
You know.

1054
01:27:36,078 --> 01:27:39,915
- It's all over. Did they hurt you?
- No, no, no...

1055
01:27:40,082 --> 01:27:41,708
You don't look so good.
Have you been eating?

1056
01:27:41,875 --> 01:27:43,752
- Yeah, I've been. You? Did they feed you?
- Did you drink too much coffee?

1057
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,420
No, you know, when I get busy.
You know.

1058
01:27:45,629 --> 01:27:46,463
Did you fall?

1059
01:27:46,630 --> 01:27:49,257
- Yeah, but... Chipped a tooth.
- We'll fix that when we get home.

1060
01:27:50,217 --> 01:27:51,593
Boy, you look good.

1061
01:27:53,136 --> 01:27:54,304
You smell nice.

1062
01:27:54,513 --> 01:27:55,847
- Yeah.
- Musty.

1063
01:27:56,306 --> 01:27:57,391
How's Jodie?

1064
01:27:57,599 --> 01:27:58,517
She's dead.

1065
01:27:59,559 --> 01:28:00,477
Kidding.

1066
01:28:03,522 --> 01:28:04,523
Pretty good.

1067
01:28:05,524 --> 01:28:06,858
So, do you have a plan here?

1068
01:28:06,983 --> 01:28:08,568
You know, I guess I'm gonna

1069
01:28:09,069 --> 01:28:11,279
I'm gonna go talk to him.

1070
01:28:12,447 --> 01:28:15,534
- Yeah. You don't mind
staying here, do - Sure.

1071
01:28:15,742 --> 01:28:17,786
Wait.
When do we call the cops?

1072
01:28:21,798 --> 01:28:25,919
You know, I mean, if he is doing
something then, I'll just,

1073
01:28:26,962 --> 01:28:28,755
I'll wave, okay?

1074
01:28:33,301 --> 01:28:35,095
That's a very good plan.

1075
01:28:42,185 --> 01:28:43,353
Tourists.

1076
01:28:47,315 --> 01:28:50,152
- Wait isn't... isn't that?
- What?

1077
01:28:51,528 --> 01:28:54,865
Excuse me! Excuse me!

1078
01:29:01,538 --> 01:29:03,331
Aren't you Raymond Barnell?

1079
01:29:03,707 --> 01:29:04,791
Go away.

1080
01:29:05,125 --> 01:29:06,752
Hey, you know, I don't really know
what's going on here,

1081
01:29:06,918 --> 01:29:08,879
but I was just wondering if maybe
you could come with me to my office

1082
01:29:09,046 --> 01:29:10,756
just for a few minutes. I mean...

1083
01:29:12,299 --> 01:29:14,342
Hey, man, you know,
I don't wanna screw with your life,

1084
01:29:14,509 --> 01:29:16,219
but you can't just walk away
with a million dollars

1085
01:29:16,386 --> 01:29:18,597
and expect people to be like,
"Hey, yeah, thanks a lot pal. "

1086
01:29:24,227 --> 01:29:25,520
How much?

1087
01:29:29,399 --> 01:29:34,780
Your brother, and I use
this term very carefully

1088
01:29:35,238 --> 01:29:39,284
has stolen a million doll ars
from my insurance company...

1089
01:29:42,287 --> 01:29:45,957
For years I've been
thinking new meds...

1090
01:29:50,253 --> 01:29:51,630
You know, maybe we should...

1091
01:29:56,385 --> 01:30:02,327
Honey, I need you to walk over to
that big hill behind me, okay? Okay?

1092
01:30:03,016 --> 01:30:07,312
Why don't you put this on now, okay?
I want you to get warm, all right?

1093
01:30:08,395 --> 01:30:12,859
- You look so good. - No matter
what you hear what you hear,

1094
01:30:13,068 --> 01:30:15,028
you just keep walking, all right?

1095
01:30:15,237 --> 01:30:18,657
If I'm late or something...

1096
01:30:18,824 --> 01:30:19,825
You're never late.

1097
01:30:20,033 --> 01:30:22,244
...look inside the coat.

1098
01:30:40,011 --> 01:30:40,929
Jimbo?

1099
01:30:51,314 --> 01:30:53,358
Million dollars, Paul?

1100
01:30:54,901 --> 01:30:58,655
Did you really think
you could take me? Again?

1101
01:30:58,989 --> 01:31:00,615
What million dollars?

1102
01:31:00,866 --> 01:31:02,159
Fuck.

1103
01:32:04,221 --> 01:32:07,057
What the fuck! She didn't have
anything to do with this!

1104
01:32:07,224 --> 01:32:08,308
And you do.

1105
01:32:12,312 --> 01:32:14,523
Put it down, Nancy.

1106
01:32:14,690 --> 01:32:16,066
You first, chief.

1107
01:32:17,359 --> 01:32:20,696
You win, tough guy.

1108
01:32:25,784 --> 01:32:26,535
Gary.

1109
01:32:27,119 --> 01:32:28,286
Sorry.

1110
01:32:31,206 --> 01:32:32,666
It was an accident!

1111
01:32:33,125 --> 01:32:35,711
- What the fuck, man?
- It wasn't me!

1112
01:32:36,044 --> 01:32:38,299
Gary!
Please don't shoot us!

1113
01:32:39,131 --> 01:32:43,677
Stop! What the fuck, Gary?
Jesus Christ!

1114
01:32:43,844 --> 01:32:44,678
No!

1115
01:32:55,022 --> 01:32:57,149
Oh!
Oh, God!

1116
01:33:11,329 --> 01:33:13,457
Oh, God.
Oh, Jesus.

1117
01:33:13,665 --> 01:33:16,668
Oh, fucking hell.
I can't breathe.

1118
01:33:29,056 --> 01:33:30,057
Can you stand?

1119
01:33:30,265 --> 01:33:32,105
- Is the Pope a...
- Easy.

1120
01:33:40,484 --> 01:33:41,360
Thank you.

1121
01:34:23,485 --> 01:34:26,071
You're gonna kill me, Gary.
Gonna kill me.

1122
01:35:05,527 --> 01:35:07,320
Look at me, you little...

1123
01:35:17,372 --> 01:35:18,373
Puddles.

1124
01:36:01,416 --> 01:36:02,542
Where do you think
you're going?

1125
01:36:02,751 --> 01:36:03,835
Ted, leave him alone!

1126
01:36:04,044 --> 01:36:05,754
No, no, no, no!

1127
01:36:08,006 --> 01:36:10,675
No, I've been beaten!

1128
01:36:11,593 --> 01:36:13,512
I've been humiliated!

1129
01:36:15,097 --> 01:36:16,973
He kicked me in the balls!

1130
01:36:17,683 --> 01:36:19,685
He kicked me in the balls!

1131
01:36:21,061 --> 01:36:22,854
And I want an answer now!

1132
01:36:23,438 --> 01:36:24,189
Okay.

1133
01:36:27,901 --> 01:36:30,570
Well, go ahead. I can still
kind of hear out of this one.

1134
01:36:36,993 --> 01:36:38,787
I love my wife, Mr. Watters.

1135
01:36:40,664 --> 01:36:42,624
And when you love someone

1136
01:36:43,875 --> 01:36:46,211
I mean, really love someone...

1137
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:47,421
That's it!

1138
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:50,966
Fuck! If I wanted a Hallmark card

1139
01:36:51,174 --> 01:36:54,177
or the lyrics to a
Foreigner rock ballad,

1140
01:36:54,344 --> 01:36:58,140
I would go to the mall, Mr. Barnell!
The Listening Game.

1141
01:37:17,034 --> 01:37:19,786
Mr. Barnell...
you can go first.

1142
01:37:39,765 --> 01:37:41,141
Habeas corpus.

1143
01:37:42,184 --> 01:37:45,896
I wanted to help
Margaret, you know?

1144
01:37:46,855 --> 01:37:48,231
I'm broke

1145
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:51,943
and that's why I came in originally
with that insurance policy thinking,

1146
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:54,613
"I can do this. You'll pay off. "

1147
01:37:54,821 --> 01:37:58,950
'Cause, you know,
I hadn't seen Raymond since...

1148
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:54,423
Where do you want to go?

1149
01:38:54,631 --> 01:38:55,507
Someplace close.

1150
01:38:55,716 --> 01:38:57,801
My three o'clock
was moved up.

1151
01:38:58,343 --> 01:39:00,429
So you all right
about everything?

1152
01:39:02,431 --> 01:39:03,515
Yeah.

1153
01:39:03,765 --> 01:39:05,142
Good. Good.

1154
01:39:05,308 --> 01:39:07,352
I like it when you're okay.

1155
01:39:12,190 --> 01:39:14,234
Don't you just love
this weather?

1156
01:39:16,570 --> 01:39:17,571
Learning to.

1157
01:39:59,424 --> 01:40:05,008
Subtitle:
sync, fix: titler

1158
01:40:06,305 --> 01:41:06,453
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
