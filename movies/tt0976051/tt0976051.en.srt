2
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:09,310
You didn't wake me.

3
00:01:10,748 --> 00:01:12,340
You were sleeping.

4
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,646
You can't bear
to have breakfast with me.

5
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,916
I've boiled you an egg. See?
I'd hardly have boiled you an egg

6
00:01:17,988 --> 00:01:21,754
if I didn't want to see you.
Um, tea or coffee?

7
00:01:21,826 --> 00:01:23,851
Does any woman
ever stay long enough

8
00:01:23,928 --> 00:01:27,489
to find out what the hell
goes on in your head?

9
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:30,226
What are you doing tonight?

10
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:32,235
I'm seeing my daughter.

11
00:01:32,303 --> 00:01:35,966
Your daughter?
You've kept very quiet about her.

12
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,167
Have I?

13
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:41,643
Well, she's been abroad for a year.

14
00:01:43,214 --> 00:01:45,205
Did you say tea?

15
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:47,014
I'm going.

16
00:01:49,954 --> 00:01:51,888
Have fun with your daughter.

17
00:02:23,654 --> 00:02:25,417
Tickets, please.

18
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:31,007
Tickets.
Excuse me.

19
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:36,523
Tickets.

20
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:41,904
Tickets, please.

21
00:03:40,564 --> 00:03:42,589
Oh!

22
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,032
Hey. Hey, you!

23
00:04:12,396 --> 00:04:14,830
Your feet. Your feet.

24
00:04:33,684 --> 00:04:35,345
Hey, kid.

25
00:04:37,087 --> 00:04:38,179
Up.

26
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:42,654
It's all right.

27
00:04:52,136 --> 00:04:55,469
There. Where do you live?

28
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:04,874
It's just up here.
I'll be fine now. Thank you.

29
00:05:06,717 --> 00:05:07,945
Goodbye.

30
00:05:17,094 --> 00:05:18,584
Look after yourself.

31
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:28,470
I'm worried about him.
He looks terrible.

32
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:30,973
The boy's saying
he doesn't need a doctor.

33
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,941
- He does.
- I don't need a doctor.

34
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,342
- Good, then.
- Peter.

35
00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:38,779
We're not going to argue about this.

36
00:05:40,084 --> 00:05:43,281
Remind me.
How old are you, now?

37
00:05:43,354 --> 00:05:45,049
Michael's 15.

38
00:05:45,122 --> 00:05:47,955
It's scarlet fever.

39
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:50,960
He'll be in bed
for several months, at least.

40
00:05:51,028 --> 00:05:53,588
Complete isolation.

41
00:05:53,664 --> 00:05:56,895
Emily, keep away. He's contagious.

42
00:05:58,869 --> 00:06:00,530
Emily!

43
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:19,248
How are you feeling?

44
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,782
Better.

45
00:06:23,193 --> 00:06:24,524
I meant to tell you...

46
00:06:25,396 --> 00:06:27,421
...the day I got ill, a woman helped me.

47
00:06:27,498 --> 00:06:29,363
She helped you?

48
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:31,833
Yes. She brought me home.

49
00:06:32,903 --> 00:06:34,165
Do you have her address?

50
00:07:10,474 --> 00:07:13,500
- Hello?
- Yes?

51
00:07:39,236 --> 00:07:42,569
I brought you these flowers
to say thank you.

52
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,869
Put them over there in the sink.

53
00:08:05,796 --> 00:08:08,924
I would have come earlier,
I've been in bed three months.

54
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:13,231
- You are better now?
- Yes. Thank you.

55
00:08:13,303 --> 00:08:18,764
- Have you always been weak?
- Oh, no. I've never been sick before.

56
00:08:18,842 --> 00:08:23,074
It's incredibly boring.
There's nothing to do.

57
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,480
I couldn't even be bothered to read.

58
00:08:30,354 --> 00:08:32,618
Well, thank you again.

59
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:36,283
Wait.

60
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,658
I'll walk with you.
I have to go to work.

61
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:44,967
Wait in the hall while I change.

62
00:11:33,704 --> 00:11:35,797
There are two more buckets downstairs.

63
00:11:35,872 --> 00:11:38,238
You can fill them and bring them up.

64
00:12:05,602 --> 00:12:08,730
You look ridiculous.
Look at you, kid.

65
00:12:11,808 --> 00:12:14,140
You can't go home like that.

66
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:21,609
Take off your clothes.
I'll run you a bath.

67
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:45,137
Do you always take
a bath in your trousers?

68
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:00,956
It's all right. I won't look.

69
00:14:07,858 --> 00:14:09,485
I'll get you a towel.

70
00:15:10,687 --> 00:15:13,281
So that's
why you came back.

71
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:32,934
You're so beautiful.

72
00:15:34,644 --> 00:15:37,135
What are you talking about?

73
00:15:46,523 --> 00:15:48,548
Look at me, kid.

74
00:15:50,493 --> 00:15:52,290
Mm! Mm!

75
00:15:52,362 --> 00:15:54,421
Slowly.

76
00:15:54,497 --> 00:15:56,727
Slowly...

77
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,597
Shh.

78
00:16:33,837 --> 00:16:35,828
You've inconvenienced your mother.

79
00:16:35,905 --> 00:16:39,932
How many more times?
I've said I'm sorry.

80
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,240
- You scared her.
- I got lost, that's all.

81
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:44,644
That's why I was late.
Can I have some more?

82
00:16:44,714 --> 00:16:47,148
How can anyone get lost
in their own hometown?

83
00:16:47,217 --> 00:16:50,243
I meant to head for the castle,
I ended up at the field.

84
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,288
- Opposite directions.
- None of your business.

85
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:56,155
- He's lying.
- He's not lying.

86
00:16:56,226 --> 00:16:57,887
Michael never lies.

87
00:17:01,598 --> 00:17:04,192
I've decided I want
to go back to school tomorrow.

88
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:07,464
- The doctor says you need three weeks.
- Well, I'm going.

89
00:17:07,537 --> 00:17:10,028
Peter?

90
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:25,019
- Hey!
- Ooh!

91
00:17:51,448 --> 00:17:54,713
Like this?

92
00:17:54,784 --> 00:17:56,809
That's right.

93
00:18:01,424 --> 00:18:03,984
No, not so fast.

94
00:18:14,404 --> 00:18:16,065
Ah!

95
00:18:18,842 --> 00:18:21,367
It's all right.

96
00:18:21,444 --> 00:18:23,412
Do it again.

97
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:28,279
Mm...

98
00:18:29,753 --> 00:18:31,277
Oh!

99
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:49,202
What's your name?

100
00:18:49,272 --> 00:18:52,070
- What?
- Your name.

101
00:18:52,142 --> 00:18:57,375
- Why do you want to know?
- I've been here three times.

102
00:18:57,447 --> 00:19:02,350
I want to know your name.
What's wrong with that?

103
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:04,546
Nothing, kid.

104
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:07,681
There's nothing wrong with that.

105
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:10,658
- It's Hanna.
- You look so suspicious.

106
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,927
- What's yours, kid?
- Michael.

107
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,492
Michael. Hmm.

108
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,800
So I'm with a Michael.

109
00:19:24,607 --> 00:19:26,131
Hanna.

110
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:31,146
The notion of secrecy
is central to Western literature.

111
00:19:32,449 --> 00:19:35,850
You may say the whole idea of character

112
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,184
is defined by people

113
00:19:39,255 --> 00:19:42,019
holding specific information,

114
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:44,753
which, for various reasons,

115
00:19:44,828 --> 00:19:48,730
sometimes perverse,
sometimes noble,

116
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:52,199
they are determined not to disclose.

117
00:20:04,814 --> 00:20:08,580
You never tell me
what you've been studying.

118
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:10,312
Studying?

119
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:13,752
At school.

120
00:20:17,126 --> 00:20:21,256
- Do you learn languages?
- Yes.

121
00:20:22,432 --> 00:20:26,266
- What languages?
- Latin.

122
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:34,233
Say something in Latin.

123
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,415
It's Horace.

124
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:44,851
It's wonderful.

125
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:47,954
Do you want some Greek?

126
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:09,209
It's beautiful.

127
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:11,804
How can you tell?

128
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:15,248
How do you know,
when you've no idea what it means?

129
00:21:18,655 --> 00:21:20,680
What are you studying in German?

130
00:21:20,757 --> 00:21:22,088
I'm studying a play.

131
00:21:24,561 --> 00:21:27,860
By a writer called Gotthold
Ephraim Lessing. You heard of him?

132
00:21:27,931 --> 00:21:32,527
The play's called <i>Emilia Galotti.</i>
You can read it.

133
00:21:32,602 --> 00:21:35,196
I'd rather listen to you.

134
00:21:35,271 --> 00:21:37,034
All right.

135
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,282
"Act One. Scene One.

136
00:21:49,352 --> 00:21:52,583
The setting:
one of the prince's chambers.

137
00:21:52,655 --> 00:21:55,215
The Prince..."

138
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,987
I'm not very good.

139
00:21:58,061 --> 00:21:59,392
Go on.

140
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:05,233
"Complaints, nothing but complaints.

141
00:22:05,301 --> 00:22:10,261
For goodness sake,
is there anything left but work?

142
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,605
Just imagine that
people actually envy us."

143
00:22:15,411 --> 00:22:17,641
You're good at it, aren't you?

144
00:22:19,983 --> 00:22:22,213
Good at what?

145
00:22:25,655 --> 00:22:27,020
Reading.

146
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:32,726
What's funny?

147
00:22:35,365 --> 00:22:37,299
I didn't think I was good at anything.

148
00:22:50,046 --> 00:22:51,775
Whoo!

149
00:24:05,321 --> 00:24:08,484
What are you doing?
What is this?

150
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:10,788
Why did you behave
as if you didn't know me?

151
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,819
You didn't want to know me! You could
see I was in the first carriage!

152
00:24:14,897 --> 00:24:18,333
- So why did you sit in the second?
- What did you think I was doing?

153
00:24:18,401 --> 00:24:21,029
- Why did you think I was there?
- How should I know?

154
00:24:21,104 --> 00:24:24,835
Now, I've been working.
I need a bath.

155
00:24:24,907 --> 00:24:27,205
And I'd like to be by myself.

156
00:24:27,276 --> 00:24:28,834
Would you please leave?!

157
00:24:33,716 --> 00:24:36,651
I... I didn't mean to upset you.

158
00:24:38,921 --> 00:24:42,186
You don't have the power to upset me.

159
00:24:42,258 --> 00:24:44,351
You don't matter enough to upset me.

160
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:04,029
I don't know what to say.

161
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:08,604
I've never been with a woman before.

162
00:26:12,748 --> 00:26:15,649
We've been together four weeks,

163
00:26:15,718 --> 00:26:18,243
and I can't live without you.

164
00:26:18,321 --> 00:26:20,687
I can't.

165
00:26:20,756 --> 00:26:23,020
Even the thought of it kills me.

166
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:32,532
I sat in the second carriage
because I thought you might kiss me.

167
00:26:33,936 --> 00:26:36,871
Kid, you thought
we could make love in a tram?

168
00:26:42,678 --> 00:26:45,203
Is it true what you said?

169
00:26:45,281 --> 00:26:47,078
That I don't matter to you?

170
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:02,556
Do you forgive me?

171
00:27:08,537 --> 00:27:09,834
Do you love me?

172
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:31,854
- Do you have a book?
- Yes, I have.

173
00:27:31,928 --> 00:27:33,691
I took one with me this morning.

174
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:38,595
- What is it?
- <i>The Odyssey,</i> by Homer.

175
00:27:38,668 --> 00:27:40,499
It's my homework.

176
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:45,773
We're changing the order we do things.

177
00:27:45,841 --> 00:27:49,675
Read to me first, kid.
Then we make love.

178
00:27:55,284 --> 00:27:59,186
- <i>The Odyssey,</i> by Homer.
- What's an odyssey?

179
00:27:59,255 --> 00:28:01,086
A journey.
He sets out on a journey.

180
00:28:02,058 --> 00:28:03,047
Good.

181
00:28:07,463 --> 00:28:11,297
<i>"Sing to me of the man, Muse</i>
<i>The man of twists and turns</i>

182
00:28:11,367 --> 00:28:14,632
<i>Driven time and again off course</i>
<i>Once he had plundered</i>

183
00:28:14,704 --> 00:28:17,673
- <i>The hallowed heights of Troy"</i>
- Come here.

184
00:28:25,181 --> 00:28:27,672
"He pressed
her hand to his lips.

185
00:28:28,818 --> 00:28:31,378
She was dead.

186
00:28:31,454 --> 00:28:34,821
Past all help, or need of it."

187
00:28:42,498 --> 00:28:46,161
"I poked into the place a
ways, encountered a little open patch

188
00:28:46,235 --> 00:28:49,727
as big as a bedroom,
all hung around with vines,

189
00:28:49,805 --> 00:28:51,705
and found a man lying there asleep.

190
00:28:51,774 --> 00:28:56,143
And, by jings, it was my old Jim.

191
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:59,670
'When you landed,
I reckoned I could catch up with you

192
00:28:59,749 --> 00:29:03,549
on the land without having to shout
at you. But when I see that house,

193
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:05,416
I begin to go slow."'

194
00:29:05,488 --> 00:29:10,221
"Lady Chatterley
felt his naked flesh against her

195
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:13,523
as he came into her.

196
00:29:13,596 --> 00:29:15,860
For a moment,
he was still inside her..."

197
00:29:15,931 --> 00:29:17,922
This is disgusting.

198
00:29:19,502 --> 00:29:21,697
Where did you get this?

199
00:29:21,771 --> 00:29:24,638
- I borrowed it from someone at school.
- Oh...

200
00:29:24,707 --> 00:29:26,538
You should be ashamed.

201
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:31,706
Go on.

202
00:29:32,882 --> 00:29:36,943
"'Billions of bilious blue blistering
barnacles in a thundering typhoon!

203
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:40,580
It is water! ' 'But what on earth
did you expect it to be?"'

204
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:44,922
- Whiskey.
- "'Whiskey, by thunder, whiskey! '

205
00:29:44,994 --> 00:29:48,452
'Whiskey? Come now, captain,
you can't be serious."'

206
00:29:48,531 --> 00:29:51,659
That's enough for today, kid.

207
00:29:51,734 --> 00:29:55,500
I was wondering, do you think
you could get some time off?

208
00:29:55,571 --> 00:29:58,096
Maybe we could go on a trip.

209
00:29:58,174 --> 00:30:01,371
- What sort of trip?
- A cycling holiday.

210
00:30:01,444 --> 00:30:03,412
Just two days.

211
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:10,416
I've got a guide book.
I've worked out the route.

212
00:30:10,486 --> 00:30:14,081
Look. What do you think?

213
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,960
I think you like planning, don't you?

214
00:30:36,245 --> 00:30:39,009
"I'm not frightened.

215
00:30:39,081 --> 00:30:40,981
I'm not frightened of anything.

216
00:30:42,852 --> 00:30:47,755
The more I suffer, the more I love.

217
00:30:47,823 --> 00:30:50,587
Danger will only increase my love.

218
00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:54,151
It will sharpen it.
It will give it spice.

219
00:30:55,998 --> 00:30:57,693
I'll be the only angel you need.

220
00:30:58,701 --> 00:31:02,603
You will leave life even more beautiful
than you entered it.

221
00:31:02,671 --> 00:31:06,368
Heaven will take you back
and look at you and say,

222
00:31:06,442 --> 00:31:12,244
'Only one thing can make a soul
complete, and that thing is love."'

223
00:31:38,474 --> 00:31:40,567
- Hello.
- Hello.

224
00:31:47,349 --> 00:31:49,442
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

225
00:31:50,553 --> 00:31:52,646
Do you know what you'd like?

226
00:31:55,224 --> 00:31:58,216
- Um...
- What are you having?

227
00:31:58,294 --> 00:32:02,196
- You order. I'll have what you have.
- OK.

228
00:32:02,264 --> 00:32:03,925
Um...

229
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:08,902
Two frankfurters, two potato salads
and two beers, please.

230
00:32:18,147 --> 00:32:20,047
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

231
00:32:20,115 --> 00:32:23,414
- I hope your mother was happy.
- Thank you.

232
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:25,680
She enjoyed her meal very much.

233
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,660
Come on.

234
00:32:58,988 --> 00:33:02,822
Here, let me show you
where we're going.

235
00:33:02,891 --> 00:33:05,689
It's OK, kid.

236
00:33:05,761 --> 00:33:08,321
I don't want to know.

237
00:34:58,607 --> 00:35:02,509
- What are you doing?
- I'm writing a poem. About you.

238
00:35:05,547 --> 00:35:08,414
- Can I hear it?
- It's not ready.

239
00:35:09,418 --> 00:35:10,942
I'll read it to you one day.

240
00:36:27,496 --> 00:36:29,964
- Morning, Hendrick.
- Good morning, Mr. Berg.

241
00:36:30,032 --> 00:36:32,364
- You're in court 306.
- Thank you.

242
00:36:32,434 --> 00:36:34,265
- You all right, Michael?
- I'm fine.

243
00:36:34,336 --> 00:36:37,362
- Hurry. You know what she's like.
- See you later!

244
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:39,066
Good luck.

245
00:36:40,676 --> 00:36:42,576
Please stand.

246
00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:48,949
Please sit down.

247
00:36:52,888 --> 00:36:55,516
The defendant, please.

248
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:07,697
They're coming.

249
00:37:13,008 --> 00:37:16,671
- Hello.
- Hello.

250
00:37:16,745 --> 00:37:19,509
- What did she say?
- Good morning, ladies.

251
00:37:19,581 --> 00:37:23,745
Welcome your new fellow-students.
Treat them with courtesy.

252
00:37:23,819 --> 00:37:26,515
- Sit down.
- Hello.

253
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:31,187
- My name's Sophie.
- I'm Michael.

254
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,228
<i>The Odyssey.</i>

255
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:35,092
Take our your books.

256
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:41,268
Everyone believes
Homer's subject is homecoming.

257
00:37:41,336 --> 00:37:44,328
In fact, <i>The Odyssey</i>
is a book about a journey.

258
00:37:44,406 --> 00:37:47,239
Home is a place you dream of.

259
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:51,370
Berg, I don't mean to distract you, but
we're meant to study Homer, not Sophie.

260
00:38:00,389 --> 00:38:02,721
- It's wonderful, isn't it?
- Wonderful.

261
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:04,315
It's gonna be a great summer.

262
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,307
- Why do you leave early?
- He always leaves early.

263
00:38:21,376 --> 00:38:24,607
- Do you have somewhere to go?
- See you tomorrow.

264
00:38:33,088 --> 00:38:35,147
Sorry I'm late.

265
00:38:37,259 --> 00:38:39,227
I got held up at school.

266
00:38:41,229 --> 00:38:42,958
I have a new book.

267
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:46,194
<i>The Lady with a Little Dog.</i>

268
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:50,066
By Anton Chekhov.

269
00:38:50,138 --> 00:38:53,437
"The talk was that a new face
had appeared on the promenade,

270
00:38:53,508 --> 00:38:55,669
a lady with a little dog."

271
00:39:08,357 --> 00:39:10,882
Schmitz, one moment, please.

272
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:16,424
I read the reports on you.
Every single one. Excellent work.

273
00:39:16,498 --> 00:39:19,092
You'll be working in the office.

274
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:22,534
You got promoted. Congratulations.

275
00:39:29,745 --> 00:39:33,704
- Yee-haw!
- Ah!

276
00:39:33,782 --> 00:39:35,977
Let's get out of here!

277
00:39:36,051 --> 00:39:39,384
Come on! Michael, we're leaving.
Let's go!

278
00:39:39,454 --> 00:39:40,580
Come on, Michael!

279
00:39:40,656 --> 00:39:43,682
It's meant to be a surprise
for your birthday.

280
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:49,457
- Come on!
- What's the matter?

281
00:39:49,531 --> 00:39:52,694
- I'm sorry. Really.
- We thought you'd like it.

282
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:54,963
We've got beer!
We're gonna dance!

283
00:39:55,937 --> 00:39:57,029
I promised someone.

284
00:39:58,173 --> 00:40:00,164
Michael, please!

285
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,943
"Here and there the reflection
of the stars and the lights,

286
00:40:09,017 --> 00:40:11,417
on the bank quivered and trembled."

287
00:40:11,486 --> 00:40:14,182
- Oh, kid, kid.
- What?

288
00:40:14,256 --> 00:40:17,157
- Stop.
- What's wrong now?

289
00:40:17,225 --> 00:40:19,750
Nothing's wrong.

290
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,093
It's nothing.

291
00:40:26,201 --> 00:40:29,602
You know, you never ask.

292
00:40:30,272 --> 00:40:33,264
You never bother to ask how I am!

293
00:40:33,341 --> 00:40:35,002
You never say.

294
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:38,142
It just happens to be my birthday.

295
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:42,711
It's my birthday, that's all!

296
00:40:42,784 --> 00:40:44,684
You've never
even asked when it is.

297
00:40:44,753 --> 00:40:47,449
- If you want a fight, kid...
- I don't want a fight!

298
00:40:47,522 --> 00:40:51,117
- What's wrong with you?!
- What business is it of yours?!

299
00:40:51,193 --> 00:40:54,560
It's always on your terms.
Everything.

300
00:40:54,629 --> 00:40:57,359
We do what you want.
It's always what you want.

301
00:40:57,432 --> 00:41:00,230
- My friends were giving me a party.
- Why are you here?

302
00:41:00,302 --> 00:41:03,965
Go back to your party.
Is that what you want?

303
00:41:06,308 --> 00:41:08,503
Mm! Mm!

304
00:41:29,631 --> 00:41:31,599
It's always me
that has to apologize.

305
00:41:31,666 --> 00:41:35,966
You don't have to apologize.
No one has to apologize.

306
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:46,408
<i>War and Peace,</i> kid.

307
00:43:31,786 --> 00:43:34,016
Now, you must go
back to your friends.

308
00:43:50,205 --> 00:43:51,194
Are you all right?

309
00:45:22,364 --> 00:45:23,695
It's him.

310
00:45:27,635 --> 00:45:29,796
Good.

311
00:45:29,871 --> 00:45:32,169
Get the boy something to eat.

312
00:45:41,182 --> 00:45:44,743
I think we all knew you'd
come back to us eventually.

313
00:46:53,855 --> 00:46:57,018
Mr. Berg? It is 8:00.

314
00:46:57,092 --> 00:46:58,855
Your daughter.

315
00:47:01,496 --> 00:47:03,623
Thank you.

316
00:47:06,267 --> 00:47:08,098
Julia.

317
00:47:10,205 --> 00:47:13,265
- I've not kept you waiting?
- I was early.

318
00:47:13,341 --> 00:47:15,571
Welcome back.

319
00:47:18,313 --> 00:47:21,441
So how will you decide?

320
00:47:21,516 --> 00:47:24,349
I don't know.

321
00:47:24,419 --> 00:47:26,319
I'm happy back in Berlin, I suppose.

322
00:47:26,387 --> 00:47:28,548
- You've seen your mother?
- Mm-hmm.

323
00:47:28,623 --> 00:47:31,251
I wanted to get away. That's all.

324
00:47:31,326 --> 00:47:33,760
It was Paris,
but it could have been anywhere.

325
00:47:33,828 --> 00:47:36,296
Away from your parents?

326
00:47:38,166 --> 00:47:40,600
I'm aware I was difficult.

327
00:47:42,437 --> 00:47:44,268
I wasn't always open with you.

328
00:47:47,809 --> 00:47:50,107
I'm not open with anyone.

329
00:47:56,618 --> 00:47:58,176
I knew you were distant.

330
00:48:00,054 --> 00:48:04,991
You know...
I always assumed it was my fault.

331
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,858
Julia.

332
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:10,659
How wrong can you be?

333
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:25,311
- I'll see you very soon.
- See you soon.

334
00:48:28,049 --> 00:48:30,609
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.

335
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:40,987
Those of you
for the special seminar group,

336
00:48:41,062 --> 00:48:43,193
please stay on in this room.

337
00:48:43,264 --> 00:48:46,028
Professor Rohl will
be here in a moment.

338
00:49:16,698 --> 00:49:21,567
Well, we seem
to be quite a small group.

339
00:49:21,636 --> 00:49:25,367
A small group and a select one.

340
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,773
Clearly, this is going
to be a unique seminar.

341
00:49:28,843 --> 00:49:33,371
We are going to start
with a reading list, gentlemen.

342
00:49:33,448 --> 00:49:35,973
Karl Jaspers...

343
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:40,350
- And ladies.
- <i>... The Question of German Guilt.</i>

344
00:49:40,421 --> 00:49:44,323
<i></i>

345
00:49:56,904 --> 00:49:59,896
So this is where you are.

346
00:49:59,974 --> 00:50:01,498
Yes.

347
00:50:03,311 --> 00:50:04,778
Come in.

348
00:50:06,881 --> 00:50:10,612
- You take work seriously.
- I don't know.

349
00:50:10,685 --> 00:50:13,119
You're rather a serious boy.

350
00:50:13,187 --> 00:50:15,280
It's how I was brought up.

351
00:50:16,858 --> 00:50:19,952
What about you? Are you serious?

352
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:25,298
You're sure you want to work tonight?

353
00:50:26,834 --> 00:50:27,994
Yeah.

354
00:50:29,737 --> 00:50:31,364
But I won't work every night.

355
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,098
See you tomorrow.

356
00:50:40,081 --> 00:50:43,175
- Yes. Exactly
- That's right.

357
00:50:47,989 --> 00:50:49,820
You need a hand.

358
00:51:14,682 --> 00:51:18,846
- Why all the police?
- They're worried about demonstrators.

359
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,787
- For or against?
- Both.

360
00:51:27,228 --> 00:51:28,718
Wow. It's a circus.

361
00:51:31,999 --> 00:51:33,899
All rise.

362
00:51:36,504 --> 00:51:38,870
All photographers
are now asked to leave.

363
00:51:40,274 --> 00:51:43,072
This court is now in session.
Please sit down.

364
00:51:46,581 --> 00:51:49,106
First thing I'm going to do
is hear motions

365
00:51:49,183 --> 00:51:51,378
from each of the defendants' lawyers.

366
00:51:51,452 --> 00:51:55,286
They're arguing that there's
no reason to keep the defendants in jail

367
00:51:55,356 --> 00:51:58,052
until the outcome
of the forthcoming trial.

368
00:51:58,126 --> 00:52:00,788
- I'll take these cases one by one.
- Want a pen?

369
00:52:00,862 --> 00:52:04,161
- I got a pen.
- Hanna Schmitz.

370
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,600
- Your name is Hanna Schmitz?
- Yes.

371
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:12,036
Can you speak louder please?

372
00:52:12,106 --> 00:52:15,166
- My name is Hanna Schmitz.
- Thank you.

373
00:52:15,243 --> 00:52:21,079
- You were born on October 21 st, 1922?
- Yes.

374
00:52:21,149 --> 00:52:22,980
At Hermannstadt.

375
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:27,384
- And you're now 43 years old?
- Yes.

376
00:52:27,455 --> 00:52:32,552
- You joined the SS in 1943?
- Yes.

377
00:52:32,627 --> 00:52:35,187
What was your
reason for joining?

378
00:52:36,898 --> 00:52:40,026
You were working
at the Siemens factory at the time?

379
00:52:40,101 --> 00:52:41,193
Yes.

380
00:52:41,269 --> 00:52:43,863
You'd recently
been offered a promotion.

381
00:52:43,938 --> 00:52:45,803
Why did you prefer to join the SS?

382
00:52:45,873 --> 00:52:49,138
- Objection.
- I'll re-phrase my question.

383
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:51,804
I'm trying to ascertain

384
00:52:51,879 --> 00:52:54,939
if she joined the SS freely, hmm?

385
00:52:55,016 --> 00:52:56,449
Of her own free will.

386
00:52:58,052 --> 00:53:01,613
- I heard there were jobs.
- Go on.

387
00:53:01,689 --> 00:53:04,522
I was working at Siemens

388
00:53:04,592 --> 00:53:07,857
when I heard the SS was recruiting.

389
00:53:07,929 --> 00:53:11,797
Did you know the kind of work
you'd be expected to do?

390
00:53:11,866 --> 00:53:15,495
They were looking for guards.

391
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:19,836
- I applied for a job.
- You worked first at Auschwitz?

392
00:53:19,907 --> 00:53:23,172
- Yes.
- Until 1944.

393
00:53:23,244 --> 00:53:27,840
Then you were moved to
a smaller camp near Krakףw?

394
00:53:27,915 --> 00:53:29,507
- Yes.
- Are you OK?

395
00:53:29,584 --> 00:53:32,314
- You helped move prisoners...
- I'm fine.

396
00:53:32,386 --> 00:53:35,844
...west in the winter of 1944
in the so-called death marches?

397
00:53:57,111 --> 00:54:00,808
- So, what did you think?
- I don't know.

398
00:54:02,049 --> 00:54:04,017
It wasn't quite what I was expecting.

399
00:54:04,085 --> 00:54:08,385
Wasn't it? In what way?
What were you expecting?

400
00:54:08,456 --> 00:54:10,788
I thought it was exciting.

401
00:54:10,858 --> 00:54:13,349
Exciting? Why?

402
00:54:13,427 --> 00:54:15,895
Why did you think it was exciting?

403
00:54:15,963 --> 00:54:17,692
Because it's justice.

404
00:54:46,928 --> 00:54:52,457
Societies think they operate
by something called morality,

405
00:54:52,533 --> 00:54:54,023
but they don't.

406
00:54:54,101 --> 00:54:58,470
They operate by something called law.

407
00:54:58,539 --> 00:55:04,171
You're not guilty of anything
merely by working at Auschwitz.

408
00:55:04,245 --> 00:55:07,510
Eight thousand people
worked at Auschwitz.

409
00:55:07,582 --> 00:55:13,077
Precisely 19 have been convicted,
and only six for murder.

410
00:55:13,154 --> 00:55:18,114
To prove murder,
you have to prove intent.

411
00:55:18,192 --> 00:55:20,023
That's the law.

412
00:55:20,094 --> 00:55:23,825
The question is never was it wrong,

413
00:55:23,898 --> 00:55:26,765
but was it legal.

414
00:55:26,834 --> 00:55:31,601
And not by our laws, no.

415
00:55:31,672 --> 00:55:35,768
- By the laws at the time.
- But isn't that...

416
00:55:35,843 --> 00:55:38,368
- What?
...narrow?

417
00:55:38,446 --> 00:55:42,314
Oh, yes. The law is narrow.

418
00:55:43,317 --> 00:55:45,478
On the other hand,

419
00:55:45,553 --> 00:55:49,011
I suspect people who kill other people

420
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:52,719
tend to be aware that it's wrong.

421
00:55:53,794 --> 00:55:58,224
Miss Schmitz,
you're familiar with this book?

422
00:56:00,334 --> 00:56:02,598
- Yes.
- Parts of it

423
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:05,138
have already been
read out in court.

424
00:56:05,206 --> 00:56:07,800
It's by a survivor,

425
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:09,809
a prisoner who survived.

426
00:56:09,877 --> 00:56:12,607
Ilana Mather.

427
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,342
She was in the camp
when she was a child, wasn't she?

428
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:18,112
- She was with her mother.
- Yes.

429
00:56:18,185 --> 00:56:22,519
In the book,
she describes a selection process.

430
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:25,616
At the end of the month's labor,
every month,

431
00:56:25,693 --> 00:56:28,753
sixty inmates were selected.

432
00:56:28,829 --> 00:56:32,321
Picked out to be sent from
the satellite camp back to Auschwitz.

433
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,334
That's right, isn't it?

434
00:56:35,703 --> 00:56:37,933
Yes, that's right.

435
00:56:38,005 --> 00:56:41,406
And, so far,
each of your fellow defendants

436
00:56:41,475 --> 00:56:44,273
has specifically denied
being part of that process.

437
00:56:44,345 --> 00:56:48,304
Now, I'm going to ask you.

438
00:56:48,382 --> 00:56:49,747
Were you part of it?

439
00:56:52,286 --> 00:56:53,310
Yes.

440
00:56:56,891 --> 00:57:00,486
So you helped make the selection?

441
00:57:00,561 --> 00:57:03,553
- Yes.
- You admit that?

442
00:57:09,036 --> 00:57:12,233
Then tell me,

443
00:57:12,306 --> 00:57:14,706
how did that selection happen?

444
00:57:14,775 --> 00:57:17,471
There were six guards,

445
00:57:17,545 --> 00:57:22,175
so we decided we'd
choose ten people each.

446
00:57:23,751 --> 00:57:26,413
That's how we did it every month.

447
00:57:26,487 --> 00:57:28,717
We'd all choose ten.

448
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:31,519
Your fellow defendants
took part in the process?

449
00:57:31,592 --> 00:57:34,356
We all did.

450
00:57:34,428 --> 00:57:37,090
Even though they've denied it?

451
00:57:37,164 --> 00:57:40,895
Saying "we," "we all"
is easier than saying "I," "I alone,"

452
00:57:40,968 --> 00:57:42,663
isn't it, Miss Schmitz?

453
00:57:44,305 --> 00:57:47,331
Did you not realize

454
00:57:47,408 --> 00:57:50,275
that you were sending
these women to their deaths?

455
00:57:50,344 --> 00:57:53,973
But they were new arrivals,
new women were arriving all the time.

456
00:57:54,048 --> 00:57:58,781
So... the old ones had to make room
for the new ones.

457
00:57:59,987 --> 00:58:03,514
- I'm not sure you understand...
- We couldn't keep everyone.

458
00:58:03,591 --> 00:58:06,025
- There wasn't room.
- No.

459
00:58:06,093 --> 00:58:09,028
But what I'm saying...

460
00:58:09,096 --> 00:58:11,860
Let me rephrase.

461
00:58:11,932 --> 00:58:14,799
To make room, you were
picking women out and saying,

462
00:58:14,869 --> 00:58:19,431
"You, you and you have
to be sent back to be killed."

463
00:58:19,507 --> 00:58:21,975
Well, what would you have done?

464
00:58:32,553 --> 00:58:34,987
Should I never
have signed up at Siemens?

465
00:58:47,468 --> 00:58:51,063
Ms. Mather,
they're ready for you now.

466
00:58:53,474 --> 00:58:56,034
Go, go. Go, go, go.

467
00:59:07,521 --> 00:59:10,217
- Where's Michael?
- I don't know.

468
00:59:11,559 --> 00:59:16,155
In your book, you describe
the process of selection.

469
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:17,822
Yes.

470
00:59:17,898 --> 00:59:21,857
You were made to work and then,
when you were no longer any use to them,

471
00:59:21,936 --> 00:59:25,372
then they sent you back
to Auschwitz to be killed.

472
00:59:25,439 --> 00:59:28,306
Are there people here
who made that selection?

473
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:30,240
Yes.

474
00:59:30,311 --> 00:59:35,749
I need you to identify them.
Can you please point them out?

475
00:59:48,462 --> 00:59:50,157
Her.

476
00:59:53,667 --> 00:59:55,032
And her.

477
00:59:57,571 --> 00:59:59,038
Her.

478
01:00:01,408 --> 01:00:03,399
And her.

479
01:00:05,412 --> 01:00:07,346
Her.

480
01:00:09,516 --> 01:00:11,143
And her.

481
01:00:12,753 --> 01:00:15,654
Thank you. Please continue.

482
01:00:15,723 --> 01:00:19,284
Each of the guards would choose
a certain number of women.

483
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,521
Hanna Schmitz chose differently.

484
01:00:21,595 --> 01:00:24,120
In what way differently?

485
01:00:28,736 --> 01:00:30,966
She had favorites.

486
01:00:32,606 --> 01:00:34,369
Girls, mostly young.

487
01:00:34,441 --> 01:00:37,239
We all remarked on it.

488
01:00:37,311 --> 01:00:40,542
She gave them food
and places to sleep.

489
01:00:40,614 --> 01:00:45,210
In the evening,
she... she asked them to join her.

490
01:00:45,286 --> 01:00:46,878
And we all thought...

491
01:00:46,954 --> 01:00:49,980
Well, you can imagine
what we thought.

492
01:00:50,057 --> 01:00:55,654
And then we found out she was making
these women read aloud to her.

493
01:00:58,365 --> 01:01:00,492
They were reading to her.

494
01:01:01,735 --> 01:01:06,297
At first, we thought this guard,
this guard is...

495
01:01:06,373 --> 01:01:11,140
...more sensitive,
she's more human, she's kinder.

496
01:01:12,046 --> 01:01:15,447
Often, she chose the weak, the sick.

497
01:01:17,151 --> 01:01:20,518
She picked them out.
She seemed to be protecting them almost.

498
01:01:20,587 --> 01:01:23,147
But then she dispatched them.

499
01:01:26,126 --> 01:01:28,219
Is that kinder?

500
01:01:37,037 --> 01:01:40,200
I want to
move on now to the march.

501
01:01:40,274 --> 01:01:44,335
As I understand it, you and your
daughter were marched for many months.

502
01:01:44,411 --> 01:01:48,575
In the winter of 1944,
our camp was closed down.

503
01:01:48,649 --> 01:01:53,643
We were told we had to move on.
But the plan kept changing every day.

504
01:01:53,721 --> 01:01:57,521
Women were dying
all around us in the snow.

505
01:01:57,591 --> 01:02:02,153
Half of us died on the march.
My daughter says in the book,

506
01:02:02,229 --> 01:02:05,528
"Less a death march,
more a death gallop."

507
01:02:07,201 --> 01:02:11,297
Please tell us about
the night in the church.

508
01:02:19,113 --> 01:02:23,777
That night, we thought we were lucky
because we had a roof over our heads.

509
01:02:23,851 --> 01:02:26,718
Go on.

510
01:02:26,787 --> 01:02:29,881
We'd arrived in a village.

511
01:02:29,957 --> 01:02:34,417
As always, the guards took the best
quarters. They took the priest's house.

512
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:37,953
But they let us sleep in a church.

513
01:02:38,032 --> 01:02:41,524
There was a bombing raid
in the middle of the night.

514
01:02:41,602 --> 01:02:43,763
The church was hit.

515
01:02:45,439 --> 01:02:49,170
At first, we could only hear the fire.
It was in the steeple.

516
01:02:51,111 --> 01:02:54,012
Then we could see burning beams...

517
01:02:55,616 --> 01:02:58,176
...and they began to crash to the floor.

518
01:03:00,721 --> 01:03:02,985
Everyone rushed...

519
01:03:04,925 --> 01:03:07,359
...rushed to the doors.

520
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:13,261
But the doors had been
locked on the outside.

521
01:03:13,333 --> 01:03:17,667
The church burned down?
Nobody came to open the doors?

522
01:03:17,738 --> 01:03:20,673
Is that right?

523
01:03:20,741 --> 01:03:22,709
Nobody.

524
01:03:22,776 --> 01:03:26,007
Even though you
were all burning to death?

525
01:03:29,183 --> 01:03:31,208
How many people were killed?

526
01:03:31,285 --> 01:03:34,345
Everyone was killed.

527
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:38,721
But you survived?

528
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,295
Thank you.

529
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:54,101
I want to thank you
for coming to this country

530
01:03:54,174 --> 01:03:56,369
today to testify.

531
01:04:00,547 --> 01:04:04,813
I don't know. I don't know
what we're doing here anymore.

532
01:04:04,885 --> 01:04:07,217
Don't you?

533
01:04:07,287 --> 01:04:09,221
You tell us to think like lawyers,

534
01:04:09,289 --> 01:04:13,350
but there's something...
disgusting about this.

535
01:04:13,427 --> 01:04:15,827
- How so?
- This didn't happen to the Germans.

536
01:04:15,896 --> 01:04:18,057
It happened to the Jews.

537
01:04:18,832 --> 01:04:22,233
- What are we trying to do?
- We're trying to understand.

538
01:04:22,302 --> 01:04:25,294
Six women locked 300 Jews in a church
and let them burn.

539
01:04:25,372 --> 01:04:27,602
What is there to understand?

540
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:33,737
Tell me! I'm asking!
What is there to understand?

541
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:40,181
I started out believing in this trial.
I thought it was great.

542
01:04:40,254 --> 01:04:43,587
Now, I think it's...
it's just a diversion.

543
01:04:43,657 --> 01:04:46,524
Yes? Diversion from what?

544
01:04:46,593 --> 01:04:49,585
You choose six women,
you put them on trial,

545
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:52,928
you say, "They were the evil ones,
they were the guilty ones."

546
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,525
One of the victims
happened to write a book.

547
01:04:55,602 --> 01:04:58,662
That's why they're on trial
and nobody else!

548
01:04:58,739 --> 01:05:02,038
Do you know how many camps
there were in Europe?

549
01:05:02,109 --> 01:05:04,543
People go on about
how much did everyone know?

550
01:05:04,611 --> 01:05:08,479
Who knew? What did they know?
Everyone knew!

551
01:05:08,549 --> 01:05:13,213
Our parents, our teachers.
That isn't the question!

552
01:05:13,287 --> 01:05:15,346
The question is,
"How'd you let this happen?"

553
01:05:15,422 --> 01:05:18,550
Better, "Why didn't you
kill yourself when you found out?"

554
01:05:21,395 --> 01:05:24,762
Thousands. That's how many.
There were thousands of camps.

555
01:05:24,831 --> 01:05:26,731
Everyone knew.

556
01:05:35,309 --> 01:05:36,640
Look at that woman.

557
01:05:38,579 --> 01:05:42,140
- Which woman?
- The woman you're always staring at.

558
01:05:42,216 --> 01:05:43,683
I'm sorry, but you are.

559
01:05:52,793 --> 01:05:54,590
I don't know which woman you mean.

560
01:05:56,096 --> 01:05:57,927
You know what I'd do?

561
01:06:00,367 --> 01:06:04,064
Put the gun in my hand,
I'd shoot her myself.

562
01:06:07,407 --> 01:06:09,272
Shoot them all!

563
01:09:04,885 --> 01:09:07,183
Why did you
not unlock the doors?

564
01:09:09,423 --> 01:09:12,017
Why did you not unlock the doors?

565
01:09:15,128 --> 01:09:18,222
I've asked all of you,
and I'm getting no answer.

566
01:09:19,332 --> 01:09:22,768
Two of the victims are in this court.
They deserve an answer.

567
01:09:26,773 --> 01:09:29,571
This is the SS report.
You all have copies.

568
01:09:31,044 --> 01:09:34,605
The report which was written,
approved and signed by all of you

569
01:09:34,681 --> 01:09:38,242
immediately after the event.
In the written report,

570
01:09:38,318 --> 01:09:43,051
you all claim you didn't even know
about the fire until after it happened.

571
01:09:43,123 --> 01:09:45,421
But that isn't true, is it?

572
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:48,184
Well?

573
01:09:49,729 --> 01:09:50,855
It's not true.

574
01:09:55,268 --> 01:09:59,034
- I don't know what you're asking.
- The first thing I'm asking

575
01:09:59,105 --> 01:10:02,905
- is why didn't you unlock the doors?
- Obviously.

576
01:10:02,976 --> 01:10:04,967
For the obvious reason.

577
01:10:06,146 --> 01:10:08,273
- We couldn't.
- Why couldn't you?

578
01:10:08,348 --> 01:10:11,215
We were guards.

579
01:10:11,284 --> 01:10:14,776
Our job was to guard the prisoners.

580
01:10:14,855 --> 01:10:17,153
We couldn't just let them escape.

581
01:10:17,224 --> 01:10:20,489
I see. And if they escaped,
then you'd be blamed,

582
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,994
you'd be charged,
you might even be executed?

583
01:10:23,063 --> 01:10:25,156
- No!
- Well, then?

584
01:10:25,232 --> 01:10:28,531
If we'd opened the doors,
there would have been chaos.

585
01:10:28,602 --> 01:10:31,366
How could we have restored order?

586
01:10:31,438 --> 01:10:34,566
It happened so fast.
It was snowing. The bombs.

587
01:10:34,641 --> 01:10:37,804
The flames... There were flames
all over the village.

588
01:10:37,878 --> 01:10:41,041
Then the screaming began,
and got worse and worse.

589
01:10:41,114 --> 01:10:44,550
If they'd all come rushing out,
we couldn't just let them escape.

590
01:10:44,618 --> 01:10:48,782
We couldn't.
We were responsible for them!

591
01:10:51,992 --> 01:10:56,019
So you did know what was happening?
You did know? You made a choice.

592
01:10:56,096 --> 01:10:58,826
You let them die,

593
01:10:58,899 --> 01:11:01,561
rather than risk letting them escape.

594
01:11:04,304 --> 01:11:07,899
The other defendants have made
an allegation against you.

595
01:11:07,974 --> 01:11:09,703
Have you heard this allegation?

596
01:11:10,977 --> 01:11:14,037
They say you were in charge.

597
01:11:14,114 --> 01:11:17,140
It isn't true.
I was... I was just one of the guards.

598
01:11:17,217 --> 01:11:19,685
- She was in charge.
- She was!

599
01:11:19,753 --> 01:11:22,221
- Of course she was.
- Did you write the report?

600
01:11:22,289 --> 01:11:27,124
No. No. We all discussed what to say.
We all wrote it together.

601
01:11:27,193 --> 01:11:29,457
She wrote the report.
She was in charge.

602
01:11:29,529 --> 01:11:30,928
- Is that true?
- No.

603
01:11:30,997 --> 01:11:32,760
- Yes, you did!
- Does it matter?

604
01:11:32,832 --> 01:11:34,959
- She wrote it.
- I need a sample

605
01:11:35,035 --> 01:11:39,165
- of your handwriting.
- My...

606
01:11:39,239 --> 01:11:41,571
- My handwriting?
- Yes. I need to establish

607
01:11:41,641 --> 01:11:44,838
- who wrote the report.
- I don't see how that's appropriate.

608
01:11:44,911 --> 01:11:48,074
- 20 years have gone by.
- Take her paper. Approach the bench.

609
01:11:48,148 --> 01:11:51,640
- Compare handwriting of 20 years?
- Approach the bench.

610
01:11:56,823 --> 01:11:59,189
I will not be overruled
in my own court.

611
01:11:59,259 --> 01:12:01,454
I'm sorry...

612
01:12:09,002 --> 01:12:10,799
I'd rather listen to you.

613
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:32,681
There's no need.

614
01:12:36,563 --> 01:12:38,497
I wrote the report.

615
01:12:52,445 --> 01:12:54,813
Silence, please.

616
01:12:56,116 --> 01:12:57,208
Order!

617
01:13:09,829 --> 01:13:12,457
You've been skipping seminars.

618
01:13:35,755 --> 01:13:38,451
I have a piece of information.

619
01:13:38,525 --> 01:13:41,426
Concerning one of the defendants.

620
01:13:41,494 --> 01:13:44,486
- Something they're not admitting.
- What information?

621
01:13:53,406 --> 01:13:55,306
You don't need me to tell you.

622
01:13:55,375 --> 01:14:00,472
It's perfectly clear. You have a moral
obligation to disclose it to the court.

623
01:14:00,547 --> 01:14:04,313
It happens this information
is favorable to the defendant.

624
01:14:04,384 --> 01:14:06,716
It can help her case.

625
01:14:06,786 --> 01:14:10,552
It may even affect the outcome,
certainly the sentencing.

626
01:14:10,623 --> 01:14:15,060
- So?
- There's a problem.

627
01:14:15,128 --> 01:14:19,155
The defendant herself is determined
to keep this information secret.

628
01:14:22,936 --> 01:14:25,063
- A moment, please.
- Sorry.

629
01:14:33,346 --> 01:14:35,644
What are her reasons?

630
01:14:38,084 --> 01:14:40,211
Because she's ashamed.

631
01:14:41,354 --> 01:14:43,686
Ashamed of what?

632
01:14:49,062 --> 01:14:52,828
- Have you spoken to her?
- Of course not.

633
01:14:52,899 --> 01:14:56,266
Why "of course not?"

634
01:14:56,336 --> 01:14:57,826
I can't.

635
01:14:59,405 --> 01:15:02,101
I can't do that.

636
01:15:02,175 --> 01:15:04,075
I can't talk to her.

637
01:15:04,144 --> 01:15:09,104
What we feel isn't important.
It's utterly unimportant.

638
01:15:09,182 --> 01:15:11,582
The only question is what we do.

639
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:18,248
If people like you don't learn

640
01:15:18,324 --> 01:15:21,623
then what the hell
is the point of anything?

641
01:15:29,736 --> 01:15:32,296
Schmitz?

642
01:15:32,372 --> 01:15:34,602
You have a visitor.

643
01:15:47,453 --> 01:15:49,785

Are you coming in?

650
01:18:15,501 --> 01:18:17,492
You took your time.

I'm sorry.

654
01:19:08,921 --> 01:19:10,821

The court
finds guilty the defendants

Rita Beckhart, Caroline Steinhoff,

of jointly aiding and abetting murder
in 300 cases.

665
01:21:10,009 --> 01:21:12,876
The court finds guilty the defendant

Hanna Schmitz of murder in 300 cases.

667
01:21:21,888 --> 01:21:24,982
The court sentences
the accused as follows:

Rita Beckhart, Caroline Steinhoff,

669
01:21:28,261 --> 01:21:32,994
Regina Kroit, Angela Zeva
and Andrea Lumen

670
01:21:33,065 --> 01:21:38,435
to each serve a total sentence in prison
of four years and three months.

671
01:21:38,504 --> 01:21:40,802
Hanna Schmitz,

672
01:21:40,873 --> 01:21:44,604
in view of your own admissions
and your special role,

673
01:21:44,677 --> 01:21:47,703
you're in a different category.

674
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:52,979
The court sentences the accused,
Schmitz, to imprisonment for life.

675
01:22:25,851 --> 01:22:27,785
Where are we going?

676
01:22:27,853 --> 01:22:30,788
I said I'll tell you when we get there.

677
01:22:30,856 --> 01:22:35,452
- You told me you liked surprises.
- I like surprises.

678
01:22:53,246 --> 01:22:55,441
She's grown, hasn't she?

679
01:22:57,216 --> 01:23:01,016
I don't know. It's so long since
I saw her, Michael. How can I tell?

680
01:23:03,256 --> 01:23:07,556
It's my fault.
We shouldn't have come unannounced.

681
01:23:07,627 --> 01:23:10,790
Daddy's going to live
in his own house.

682
01:23:13,966 --> 01:23:17,197
Mother, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

683
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:20,296
Julia knows.
We've already told her.

684
01:23:20,373 --> 01:23:22,534
Gertrud and I,
we are getting a divorce.

685
01:23:22,608 --> 01:23:26,635
You don't come for your father's
funeral, but you come for this?

686
01:23:29,081 --> 01:23:31,140
It's not easy
for me to visit this town.

687
01:23:31,217 --> 01:23:34,345
- Were you really so unhappy?
- That's not what I'm saying.

688
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:36,888
- It's not what I meant.
- Well, then?

689
01:23:39,258 --> 01:23:43,592
You mustn't worry about Gertrud.
I'm going to look after her.

690
01:23:43,663 --> 01:23:47,963
She's already a state prosecutor,
so she earns far more than I do.

691
01:23:48,034 --> 01:23:49,661
Michael...

692
01:23:51,370 --> 01:23:54,339

693
01:23:54,407 --> 01:23:55,999

797
01:37:38,630 --> 01:37:40,188
Quite small, but it's nice.

798
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:44,234
- You'll like it.
- Thank you.

799
01:37:46,071 --> 01:37:51,099
There are various social programs,
cultural stuff I can sign you up for.

800
01:37:51,176 --> 01:37:53,872
And the public library is very close.

801
01:38:00,352 --> 01:38:01,649
You read a lot?

802
01:38:04,589 --> 01:38:07,217
I prefer being read to.

803
01:38:11,863 --> 01:38:13,728
That's over now, isn't it?

804
01:38:23,408 --> 01:38:25,501
Did you get married?

805
01:38:25,577 --> 01:38:28,705
I did. Yes, I did.

806
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:30,839
We have a daughter.

807
01:38:30,916 --> 01:38:34,352
I'm not seeing as much of her
as I'd like.

808
01:38:34,419 --> 01:38:36,944
I'd like to see
a great deal more of her.

809
01:38:39,191 --> 01:38:41,284
The marriage didn't last.

810
01:38:56,708 --> 01:38:59,176
Have you spent time
thinking about the past?

811
01:38:59,244 --> 01:39:03,044
- You mean with you?
- No.

812
01:39:03,114 --> 01:39:06,845
No, I didn't mean with me.

813
01:39:16,328 --> 01:39:20,094
Before the trial,
I never thought about the past.

814
01:39:20,165 --> 01:39:22,326
I never had to.

815
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:24,664
Now?

816
01:39:25,937 --> 01:39:27,370
What do you feel now?

817
01:39:29,107 --> 01:39:31,439
It doesn't matter what I feel.

818
01:39:32,444 --> 01:39:34,571
It doesn't matter what I think.

819
01:39:36,681 --> 01:39:38,478
The dead are still dead.

820
01:39:45,991 --> 01:39:47,925
I wasn't sure what you'd learned.

821
01:39:47,993 --> 01:39:51,861
Well, I have learned, kid.

822
01:39:51,930 --> 01:39:54,330
I've learned to read.

823
01:40:08,213 --> 01:40:09,805
I'll pick you up next week, OK?

824
01:40:19,224 --> 01:40:21,158
That sounds a good plan.

825
01:40:23,828 --> 01:40:27,491
We can do it quietly,
or we can make a fuss.

826
01:40:27,565 --> 01:40:29,430
Quietly.

827
01:40:31,436 --> 01:40:33,666
OK. Quietly.

828
01:40:36,408 --> 01:40:38,273
Quietly.

829
01:40:46,885 --> 01:40:50,912
- Take care, kid.
- You, too. See you next week.

830
01:43:03,621 --> 01:43:06,112
I've come to collect Hanna Schmitz.

831
01:43:10,028 --> 01:43:13,293
Please. Please, take a seat.

832
01:43:38,590 --> 01:43:41,218
She didn't pack.

833
01:43:41,292 --> 01:43:43,590
She never intended to leave.

834
01:43:49,334 --> 01:43:52,792
"The talk was that a new face

835
01:43:52,871 --> 01:43:56,466
had appeared on the promenade,

836
01:43:56,541 --> 01:43:59,237
a lady with a little dog."

837
01:44:06,284 --> 01:44:07,979
She left me a message.

838
01:44:09,888 --> 01:44:11,788
A sort of will.

839
01:44:13,858 --> 01:44:16,793
I'll read the bit that concerns you.

840
01:44:24,569 --> 01:44:27,561
"There is money in the old tea tin.

841
01:44:27,639 --> 01:44:30,403
Give it to Michael Berg.

842
01:44:30,475 --> 01:44:35,139
He should send it,
alongside the 7,000 Marks in the bank,

843
01:44:35,213 --> 01:44:39,013
to the daughter who survived the fire.

844
01:44:39,083 --> 01:44:41,244
It's for her.

845
01:44:41,319 --> 01:44:44,345
She should decide what to do with it.

846
01:44:47,859 --> 01:44:50,692
And tell Michael I said hello."

847
01:46:08,973 --> 01:46:11,339
- Ms. Mather?
- Yes.

848
01:46:12,043 --> 01:46:14,170
- You're Michael Berg.
- Yes.

849
01:46:14,245 --> 01:46:16,145
I was expecting you.

850
01:46:17,515 --> 01:46:21,212
- Please.
- Thank you.

851
01:46:21,285 --> 01:46:25,745
So you must tell me, exactly what
brings you to the United States?

852
01:46:25,823 --> 01:46:28,917
I was here already.
I was at a conference in Boston.

853
01:46:28,993 --> 01:46:30,290
- You're a lawyer?
- Yes.

854
01:46:30,361 --> 01:46:35,424
I was intrigued by your letter,
but I can't say I wholly understood it.

855
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:39,527
- You attended the trial?
- Yes. Almost 20 years ago.

856
01:46:39,604 --> 01:46:45,440
I was a law student. I remember you.
I remember your mother very clearly.

857
01:46:45,510 --> 01:46:49,378
My mother died in Israel
a good many years ago.

858
01:46:49,447 --> 01:46:52,883
I... I'm sorry.

859
01:46:52,950 --> 01:46:54,850
Go on, please.

860
01:46:56,721 --> 01:46:58,621
Perhaps you heard.

861
01:46:58,690 --> 01:47:03,491
Hanna Schmitz recently died.
She killed herself.

862
01:47:04,829 --> 01:47:06,262
She was a friend of yours?

863
01:47:07,799 --> 01:47:09,232
A kind of friend.

864
01:47:10,768 --> 01:47:12,793
It's as simple as this.

865
01:47:12,870 --> 01:47:17,239
Hanna was illiterate
for the greater part of her life.

866
01:47:17,308 --> 01:47:20,471
Is that an explanation
of her behavior?

867
01:47:22,180 --> 01:47:24,444
- No.
- Or an excuse?

868
01:47:24,515 --> 01:47:26,608
No. No.

869
01:47:29,687 --> 01:47:33,418
She taught herself to read
when she was in prison.

870
01:47:33,491 --> 01:47:36,153
I sent her tapes.

871
01:47:38,763 --> 01:47:42,631
She had always liked...
being read to.

872
01:47:49,507 --> 01:47:52,237
Why don't you start
by being honest with me?

873
01:47:52,310 --> 01:47:55,370
At least start that way.

874
01:47:55,446 --> 01:47:58,074
What was the nature
of your friendship?

875
01:48:02,987 --> 01:48:05,820
When I was young,
I had an affair with Hanna.

876
01:48:11,763 --> 01:48:13,663
I'm not sure I can help you, Mr. Berg.

877
01:48:13,731 --> 01:48:15,892
And...

878
01:48:15,967 --> 01:48:18,128
...even if I could,
I'm not willing to.

879
01:48:18,202 --> 01:48:20,830
I was almost 16
when I took up with her.

880
01:48:20,905 --> 01:48:24,136
The affair only lasted a summer.
But...

881
01:48:25,710 --> 01:48:27,837
But what?

882
01:48:33,684 --> 01:48:35,413
I see.

883
01:48:37,622 --> 01:48:42,389
And did Hanna Schmitz acknowledge
the effect she'd had on your life?

884
01:48:44,128 --> 01:48:47,461
She'd done much worse
to other people.

885
01:48:52,436 --> 01:48:54,131
I've never told anyone.

886
01:48:58,476 --> 01:49:01,775
People ask all the time
what I learned in the camps.

887
01:49:01,846 --> 01:49:04,576
But the camps weren't therapy.

888
01:49:06,684 --> 01:49:09,414
What do you think these places were,
universities?

889
01:49:11,055 --> 01:49:13,649
We didn't go there to learn.

890
01:49:13,724 --> 01:49:17,785
One becomes very clear
about these things.

891
01:49:21,232 --> 01:49:23,928
What are you asking for?
Forgiveness for her?

892
01:49:24,001 --> 01:49:26,765
Or do you just want
to feel better yourself?

893
01:49:26,838 --> 01:49:30,672
My advice? Go to the theater
if you want catharsis. Please.

894
01:49:30,741 --> 01:49:32,641
Go to literature.

895
01:49:32,710 --> 01:49:35,907
Don't go to the camps.

896
01:49:37,481 --> 01:49:39,915
Nothing comes out of the camps.

897
01:49:42,420 --> 01:49:44,479
Nothing.

898
01:49:57,768 --> 01:49:59,633
What she wanted...

899
01:50:00,538 --> 01:50:04,975
What she wanted was
to leave you her money.

900
01:50:05,042 --> 01:50:07,875
- I have it with me.
- To do what?

901
01:50:09,981 --> 01:50:11,710
As you think fit.

902
01:50:22,727 --> 01:50:24,285
Here.

903
01:50:32,870 --> 01:50:37,671
When I was a little girl,
I had a tea tin for my treasures.

904
01:50:37,742 --> 01:50:42,042
Not quite like this.
It had Cyrillic lettering.

905
01:50:44,916 --> 01:50:48,181
I took it with me to the camp,
but it got stolen.

906
01:50:48,252 --> 01:50:51,744
- What was in it?
- Sentimental things.

907
01:50:51,822 --> 01:50:55,952
A piece of hair from our dog.
Some tickets to the operas

908
01:50:56,027 --> 01:50:59,929
my father had taken me to.
It wasn't stolen for its contents.

909
01:50:59,997 --> 01:51:03,899
It was the tin itself

910
01:51:03,968 --> 01:51:06,596
that was valuable,

911
01:51:06,671 --> 01:51:08,332
what you could do with it.

912
01:51:16,547 --> 01:51:19,482
There's nothing
I can do with this money.

913
01:51:19,550 --> 01:51:22,951
I give it to anything associated
with extermination of Jews,

914
01:51:23,020 --> 01:51:25,614
then to me it seems...

915
01:51:25,690 --> 01:51:29,057
...like absolution, and that's
something I'm neither willing

916
01:51:29,126 --> 01:51:32,857
- nor in a position to grant.
- I was thinking maybe

917
01:51:32,930 --> 01:51:36,798
an organization to encourage literacy.

918
01:51:40,638 --> 01:51:43,163
Good. Good.

919
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:46,107
Do you know if there
is a Jewish organization?

920
01:51:46,177 --> 01:51:47,940
I'd be surprised if there isn't.

921
01:51:48,012 --> 01:51:51,641
There's a Jewish organization
for everything.

922
01:51:51,716 --> 01:51:54,810
Not that illiteracy
is a very Jewish problem.

923
01:51:56,654 --> 01:51:59,919
Why don't you find out?
Send them the money.

924
01:52:16,140 --> 01:52:18,074
Shall I do it in Hanna's name?

925
01:52:20,077 --> 01:52:21,567
As you think fit.

926
01:52:26,884 --> 01:52:28,681
I'll keep the tin.

927
01:52:33,624 --> 01:52:35,251
Thank you.

928
01:53:27,178 --> 01:53:31,911
- Where are we going?
- I thought you liked surprises.

929
01:53:31,982 --> 01:53:35,110
I do. I do like surprises.

930
01:54:39,383 --> 01:54:42,181
Hanna Schmitz.

931
01:54:46,524 --> 01:54:47,616
Who was she?

932
01:54:50,161 --> 01:54:52,561
That's what I wanted to tell you.

933
01:54:54,732 --> 01:54:56,859
That's why we're here.

934
01:55:05,042 --> 01:55:06,634
So tell me.

935
01:55:18,355 --> 01:55:20,789
I was 15.

936
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:25,885
I was coming home from school.

937
01:55:27,965 --> 01:55:29,796
I was feeling ill.

938
01:55:31,101 --> 01:55:33,535
And a woman helped me.

939
01:57:33,536 --> 01:57:34,536
