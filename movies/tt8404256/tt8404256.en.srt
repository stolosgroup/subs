3
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:20,448
I'm guessing it's the relay
or the spark plugs.

4
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,450
I got tools
back at the cabin.

5
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,518
Shouldn't be a big job.

6
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:25,785
Can I help?

7
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,822

8
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:33,593
Dad?

9
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,796
Yeah. Yeah, sure you can help.

10
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,268
Is there a safe?
At the cabin.

11
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:42,936
Why?

12
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,207
- You got valuables you trying to hide?
- [chuckles] No.

13
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,576
Worried I'm gonna steal
your baseball cards?

14
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:49,843
No.

15
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,611
I heard you on the phone
the other night.

16
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,613
You said you were
at a safe house.

17
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,916
It's just another word
for cabin.

18
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:58,519
So there's no safe?

19
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,187
There's a fireplace, though.

20
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,058
Maybe we can roast
some marshmallows.

21
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,370
Hey. Hey. Hey.

22
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,872
Hey. We need to leave.

23
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,874
Right now. Come on.

24
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:22,376
Dad?

25
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:29,183
[dog barking]

26
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:31,385
Dad, what's happening?

27
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,165
Do not move,
no matter what happens.

You were almost hard to find.

31
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,324
Let's have it.

32
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,997
All of it.

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,775
Here is how I make decisions.

37
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,414
Win, you live.

38
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:42,283
Lose,

39
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,218
you die.

40
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:56,196
Now that's too bad.

41
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,965
Snake eyes.

42
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:02,002
What can I say?
House always wins.

43
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,936
No!

44
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:08,542
Run!

45
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,191
Kid's gone.

62
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,161
Snake Eyes!

63
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:17,331
[cheering continues]

64
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:23,637
They call you "Snake Eyes"
and yet you always win.

65
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:26,907
Of course,
your technique is a bit crude,

66
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,176
but that has its advantages.

67
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:32,779
I've been watching you
for a while now.

68
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,516
That ain't creepy at all.

69
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:38,719
When you grow up on the streets,
it's them or you, right?

70
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:42,990
My name is Kenta Takamura,
and I could use a man like you.

71
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:47,694
Ain't nothing personal,
but I don't work for guys like you.

72
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,062
Or anyone,
for that matter.

73
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,798
I know.
You are a drifter.

74
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:55,569
You fight until no one will bet
against you anymore and then move on.

75
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,271
Works for me.

76
00:08:57,404 --> 00:09:00,807
They said you watched your old man
get killed when you were just a boy.

77
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,610
True?

78
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,681
I like to know
who I'm hiring.

79
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:15,756
I told you, I ain't interested.
You got the wrong guy.

80
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,891
- You haven't heard my offer yet.
- I don't care.

81
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:23,597
"Homicide victim recovered from
cabin fire is still unidentified."

82
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,367
My men found it
going through your motel room.

83
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:31,138
Sounds like the police
could never ID the body.

84
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:34,374
Nor did they
ever find the killer.

85
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:39,179
That, Mr. Snake Eyes,
is my offer.

86
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:46,054
I'm pretty good
at finding people.

87
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,622
Especially people
who kill other people.

88
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,593
Come work for me,

89
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:56,430
and I promise you,
I'll find the man who did this.

90
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:14,815
I'll find a spot for you
in my crew.

91
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,883
You can start
at the docks.

92
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:49,650
[Snake Eyes] Hey.

93
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,653
[chuckles]

94
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,093
Uh-oh.

95
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,361
Here comes Fish Boy.

96
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,730
Cover up! Cover up! Cover up!

97
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,832
Let me know
when you get a new joke.

98
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,069
Oi! [shouts in Japanese]

99
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,171
- Hey. Easy, easy. They're just kids.
- [kids shouting]

100
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,675
Throw it over. Yeah.

101
00:11:16,044 --> 00:11:19,179
I'm guessing you were always
picked last on the playground, huh?

102
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,049
Hey! No, no, no! Huh?

103
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,416
Take it easy.

104
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,652
He meant no disrespect.
Right?

105
00:11:26,054 --> 00:11:27,821
Yeah. Sure.

106
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,560
I don't know what your deal
is, but you have guts.

107
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,568
Boss.

108
00:12:07,195 --> 00:12:08,462
[man] Hey!

109
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,531
Fish Boy.

110

111
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:18,739
Boss wants to talk to you.

112
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,974
Am I in trouble?

113
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,011
Someone is.

114
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,581
Leave the knife. Mmm?

115
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,455
We operate on one currency.

116
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:40,961
Not money. Not fear.
Just one simple thing.

117
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,396
Trust.

118
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:47,601
See, 'cause without trust,
there can be no loyalty.

119
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:50,004
And without loyalty...

120
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:54,041
there is no yakuza.

You look surprised
to see me.

00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:25,173
Kenta.

128
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,706
I wouldn't have pictured you

129
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,179
in a place like this
with friends like these.

130
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:35,283
My cousin here is one of
Japan's most powerful sons.

131
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,951
And you are one
of its most disgraced.

132
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:41,488
This man betrayed our trust.

133
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:45,959
He's an undercover spy, acting out
of loyalty to his precious clan.

really looks like.

Yeah.

Good.

- You're alive.
- Tommy.

184
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,066
You're safe.

185
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,368
We are going home.

186
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:05,905
I don't have a home.

187
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:07,840
Not yours.

188
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:09,443
Mine.

189
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:14,048
I owe you a blood debt.

190
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:17,817
You saved my life. Why?

191
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,288
I'm not a murderer.

192
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,793
I looked into your eyes,
and I saw honor.

193
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:35,169
So why run guns
for the yakuza?

194
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:38,938
That was a mistake.

195
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:41,375
Well, you got that right.

196
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,312
If Kenta
ever sees you again,

197
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,514
you are a dead man.

198
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:56,390
He called you cousins.

199
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:02,162
We grew up together.

200
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:06,100
We were both next in line
to become leader of our clan.

201
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:10,371
But there can only be one.

202
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:14,275
So Kenta tried
to have me killed.

203
00:21:16,377 --> 00:21:19,779
When his treachery
was discovered...

204
00:21:21,081 --> 00:21:24,784
I was given the responsibility
to decide his fate.

205
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:30,024
I ordered him banished.

206
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,293
And since then,

207
00:21:32,426 --> 00:21:37,164
he has been trying to seize
power the only way he knows how.

208
00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:41,735
Through greed and violence.

209
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:46,839
I didn't know till today it was
Kenta smuggling these guns to Japan.

210
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,310
I was ambushed.

211
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,978
You're his enemy now too.

212
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:56,816
Which means
your "Fish Boy" life in LA...

213
00:21:58,218 --> 00:21:59,453
is over.

214
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,361
There's no going back.

215
00:22:11,198 --> 00:22:12,999
Hey, where are we heading?

216
00:22:37,825 --> 00:22:39,059
Really?

217
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:36,316
What is it exactly you do?

218
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,353
A little of this,
little of that.

219
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,025
- That your wife?
- No.

220
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:46,693
- Your girlfriend.
- Uh-uh.

221
00:23:46,827 --> 00:23:47,960
Sister?

222
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:51,165
Akiko is our chief of security.

223
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:55,436
We value her advice,
but we don't have to take it.

224
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:06,013
The leader of our clan
rarely meets outsiders.

225
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,348
Don't forget to bow.

Snake Eyes,

228
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:29,303
I present the leader
of the clan Arashikage, Sen.

229
00:24:31,605 --> 00:24:32,806
My grandmother.

230
00:24:33,607 --> 00:24:36,810
The man who saved
my grandson's life.

231
00:24:36,944 --> 00:24:40,147
We Arashikage
are in your debt,

232
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,584
which means Japan
is in your debt.

233
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:45,953
Don't worry about it.

234
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:49,223
I'll settle for a hot bath
and a plane ticket out of here.

235
00:24:50,357 --> 00:24:52,526
I have a better idea.

236
00:24:54,027 --> 00:24:55,596
Stay.

237
00:24:57,931 --> 00:25:00,133
I want you to join us.

238
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,236
Join the Arashikage.

Sen-sama.
If I may.

240
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:08,642
Even allowing him
this much access is reckless.

241
00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:11,712
- I vouch for him.
- With respect, Tommy-san,

242
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:14,414
you do not lead
this clan.

243
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:16,683
Not yet.

244
00:25:16,817 --> 00:25:18,619
Someday I will.

245
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:25,726
And I will need a warrior
like this by my side.

246
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:30,430
Someone I can trust
with my life.

247
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:34,635
For 600 years,

248
00:25:34,768 --> 00:25:39,273
our ninja have brought
peace and stability to Japan.

249
00:25:39,406 --> 00:25:43,977
The secret blade and iron wall of
every government since the age of Edo.

250
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:46,146
But things have changed.

251
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,917
New threats
call for new strategies.

252
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,386
Even welcoming outsiders...

253
00:25:53,687 --> 00:25:57,124
as you, of all of us,
should know, Akiko.

254
00:26:00,294 --> 00:26:03,630
Any questions we have about
our new friend,

255
00:26:04,665 --> 00:26:09,037
the Three Challenges of the
Warrior will answer them.

256
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:12,239
And will he submit
to the challenges?

257
00:26:16,977 --> 00:26:18,345
He will.

258
00:26:30,657 --> 00:26:32,960
I'm sorry, the Three
Challenges of the what now?

259
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:37,798
The Three Challenges are designed
to reveal an applicant's character.

260
00:26:38,832 --> 00:26:43,270
The first two will cleanse you of
ego, anger and fear

261
00:26:43,403 --> 00:26:45,672
and ready you for the third.

262
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:48,675
That's the true test.

263
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:52,546
It will be up to you
whether you wish to take it.

264
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,815
What if I fail?

265
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:58,518
You die.

You're being serious.

268
00:27:06,027 --> 00:27:09,329
I wouldn't put you in that position
if I thought it was likely.

269
00:27:11,732 --> 00:27:15,669
I can't give you
a name or a past...

270
00:27:17,005 --> 00:27:19,773
but I can offer you a purpose.

271
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:22,309
And something more important.

272
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,745
A home.

273
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:30,651
And why would you do that?

274
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:35,288
Because I saw honor
in your eyes, too.

275
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:42,496
Come.

276
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,337
Get some rest.
You have time to decide.

277
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:11,725
In the meantime,
consider my home your home.

278
00:28:14,128 --> 00:28:16,363
So your toys,
my toys, huh?

guardians, infiltrators.</i>

<i>You will be tested, you will be hurt,
you will suffer, and you will fail.</i>

listening to you complain about it.</i>

[Akiko]
I still think this is a mistake.

291
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,039
Zero hits on his fingerprints.

292
00:29:32,173 --> 00:29:35,176
Nothing on any of our
facial recognition platforms.

293
00:29:35,308 --> 00:29:37,611
This stray dog of yours
is a ghost.

294
00:29:39,312 --> 00:29:40,881
I'm not scared of ghosts.

295
00:29:41,015 --> 00:29:42,382
I'm serious, Tommy.

296
00:29:42,516 --> 00:29:44,152
He was working for the
yakuza, for God's sake.

297
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,920
- He's not one of them.
- That doesn't make him one of us.

298
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:49,823
"Us"?

299
00:29:54,262 --> 00:29:55,529
My name...

300
00:29:56,463 --> 00:30:00,400
My name is
Tomisaburo Arashikage.

301
00:30:01,535 --> 00:30:04,805
You think
I would endanger this clan?

302
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,508
I am this clan.

303
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:12,079
Tommy-san, I wasn't
questioning your loyalty.

304
00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:14,881
Just my judgment.

305
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:19,686
He saved my life, Akiko.

306
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,822
I owe him this chance.

307
00:30:21,955 --> 00:30:23,024
I understand it.

308
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:25,592
I'm just worried
you're moving too fast.

309
00:30:25,725 --> 00:30:28,062
"Too quick to anger,
too quick to react."

310
00:30:28,196 --> 00:30:30,897
Now you sound like Grandmother.

311
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:36,336
If I'm wrong about him,
we'll find out tomorrow.

312
00:30:37,704 --> 00:30:40,308
80% of candidates
fail the first challenge.

313
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,708
Just saying.

314
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:46,346
Well, that means
20% pass, Akiko.

315
00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:49,516
Just saying.

316
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:53,620
[Sen] For 600 years,

317
00:30:54,255 --> 00:30:55,856
our fighters have been trained

318
00:30:55,989 --> 00:30:59,459
by the greatest warriors
the world has ever known.

319
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:02,063
Hard Master.

320
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,539
And most honorable

321
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:15,408
Blind Master.

322
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:19,913
From them,
you will learn how to fight,

323
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,382
how to kill when necessary,

324
00:31:22,515 --> 00:31:24,484
but most importantly,

325
00:31:24,618 --> 00:31:28,855
how to live according to
the Arashikage Mindset.

326
00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:30,590
Abandon ego.

327
00:31:31,158 --> 00:31:33,560
Strike with honor.

328
00:31:33,693 --> 00:31:38,698
Selflessness and truthfulness
will lead to harmony.

329
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:41,401
Any questions?

330
00:31:42,535 --> 00:31:44,105
- What happens...
- Silence!

331
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:46,740
You are nothing.

332
00:31:46,873 --> 00:31:49,043
This challenge
is a waste of time.

333
00:31:51,012 --> 00:31:52,046
You will fail.

334
00:31:53,281 --> 00:31:56,917
Okay, Hard-on Master,
or whatever your name is.

335
00:31:58,551 --> 00:32:00,021
Let's go.

336
00:32:40,261 --> 00:32:41,494
Challenge one.

337
00:32:44,065 --> 00:32:47,600
Take this bowl from me.
I'll take that bowl from you.

338
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:50,037
Okay, I'll bite.

339
00:32:50,603 --> 00:32:51,905
What's the punch line?

340
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:55,309
You must take my bowl
without spilling any water.

341
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:59,080
Fail four times and your training
is over before it begins.

342
00:33:14,728 --> 00:33:16,030
- [grunts]
- That's one.

343
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:17,630
[chuckles]

344
00:33:41,422 --> 00:33:42,689
Two.

345
00:34:10,017 --> 00:34:11,185
[grunts]

346
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:20,627
That's three.

[Tommy] <i>Abandon ego.</i>

353
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,314
Hard Master.

354
00:35:14,681 --> 00:35:19,652
I humbly request that you accept
my bowl in exchange for yours.

355
00:35:34,568 --> 00:35:36,570
No congratulations?

356
00:35:36,703 --> 00:35:38,139
One down, two to go.

357
00:35:38,272 --> 00:35:39,406
Congratulations.

358
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,942
If I ever need a bowl of water,
I know who to ask.

359
00:35:44,744 --> 00:35:46,480
You hide it well,

360
00:35:46,614 --> 00:35:49,517
but I can tell you're
a little impressed with me.

361
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:52,119
What I think of you
is irrelevant.

362
00:35:52,253 --> 00:35:55,322
You'll survive the
third test or you won't.

363
00:35:55,456 --> 00:35:57,924
Then it won't matter at all.

364
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:03,264
To Tommy, our future <i>toryo.</i>

365
00:36:03,397 --> 00:36:07,034
May you be strong,
wise and honorable.

366
00:36:07,168 --> 00:36:08,735
[Hard Master] To Snake Eyes.

367
00:36:09,303 --> 00:36:10,237
May you die well.

[all] <i>Kanpai!</i>

371
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:20,347
That word he used,
<i>"toryo."</i>

372
00:36:21,048 --> 00:36:24,717
It means
"head of family."

373
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:27,454
I am the last of
the Arashikage bloodline.

374
00:36:27,588 --> 00:36:31,991
Ever since I was a child,
I've been groomed to lead.

375
00:36:32,593 --> 00:36:34,994
This is my destiny.

376
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:41,834
But if I'm to lead the clan
into the next hundred years,

377
00:36:42,503 --> 00:36:44,171
I have to adapt.

378
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:47,874
We have to adapt.

379
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:52,379
I need warriors like you,

380
00:36:53,214 --> 00:36:55,715
who have lived in
and know the new world

381
00:36:55,848 --> 00:36:57,850
but can master
the Arashikage Mindset,

382
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:01,088
to become
the future of the clan

383
00:37:01,222 --> 00:37:05,825
and fight side by side
as brothers.

384
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:10,464
Anyway, eat.

385
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,080
Why is Hard Master
staring at me like that?

386
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:27,981
He isn't.

387
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:30,317
He is very nearsighted.

388
00:37:31,151 --> 00:37:34,088
The Blind Master,
on the other hand...

389
00:37:35,022 --> 00:37:37,024
he is watching you.

390
00:37:45,932 --> 00:37:48,502
They say he knows a liar
when he hears one.

[man speaking Japanese]

Tommy said I could
borrow one of his bikes.

00:37:58,712 --> 00:37:59,647
His motorbikes?

[people chattering]

Keep an eye on the bike.

[patrons chattering]

400
00:39:04,311 --> 00:39:06,879
I didn't know
if you would show up.

401
00:39:08,415 --> 00:39:10,017
Why?

402
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:13,220
Just because you left me to
bleed out on a dock in LA?

403
00:39:13,354 --> 00:39:15,656
All you had to do was
get Tommy on that boat.

404
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:18,726
Think you could've mentioned
that he'd wade through 50 yakuza

405
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:21,028
just for the chance
to kick your ass?

406
00:39:21,161 --> 00:39:24,064
Hey, it worked.

407
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:25,965
You earned his trust.

408
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,768
You got in.

409
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,037
By the way, how did he like,

410
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:33,374
"I looked into your eyes
and saw honor"?

411
00:39:34,475 --> 00:39:37,244
- He ate it up.
- I knew he would.

412
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:41,215
He told me
about your history.

413
00:39:41,348 --> 00:39:44,218
How you tried to kill him
and he cast you out of the clan.

414
00:39:45,252 --> 00:39:47,187
Our family drama
is not your concern.

415
00:39:47,321 --> 00:39:49,922
Yeah, you're right about that,
'cause I'm out.

416
00:39:52,025 --> 00:39:52,959
We had an agreement.

417
00:39:53,093 --> 00:39:54,361
And I seem to be the only guy

418
00:39:54,495 --> 00:39:56,663
who's keeping up his end of it.

419
00:39:56,797 --> 00:39:59,066
And here I had
a gift for you.

420
00:40:02,603 --> 00:40:04,138
You found him.

421
00:40:18,652 --> 00:40:20,987
- Where?
- Easy now.

422
00:40:21,988 --> 00:40:25,225
I kept my word.
Now you have to keep yours.

423
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,494
They want me
to take three tests.

424
00:40:28,162 --> 00:40:29,630
I fail the third, I die.

425
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:32,699
So whatever you need me to
do, it better be quick.

426
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:34,334
It's up to you.

427
00:40:34,468 --> 00:40:39,173
There is a priceless artifact
hidden in the castle grounds.

428
00:40:40,274 --> 00:40:42,376
The Jewel of the Sun.

429
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:46,180
It's a symbol
of Arashikage's power.

430
00:40:46,946 --> 00:40:49,183
Find the jewel
and bring it to me...

431
00:40:50,451 --> 00:40:52,985
and I'll give you
your father's killer.

"You're welcome."

This place is built like a fortress.
What are you protecting?

439
00:41:50,611 --> 00:41:51,778
When I was young,

440
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:56,617
I was told stories
of the Sun Goddess.

441
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:00,654
Once, long ago, she wanted to
test the character of her people,

442
00:42:00,787 --> 00:42:06,360
so she sent down a gift
in the form of a jewel.

443
00:42:08,662 --> 00:42:12,499
A jewel that contained
the power of the sun.

444
00:42:12,633 --> 00:42:15,936
We swore an oath to protect
it, but more important,

445
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:18,272
to never use it ourselves.

446
00:42:18,405 --> 00:42:21,074
As I grew, I realized why.

447
00:42:22,743 --> 00:42:26,280
We have the power to destroy
anyone who wrongs us,

448
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:29,249
but that is
a dangerous temptation.

449
00:42:29,383 --> 00:42:32,352
True power
calls for discipline.

450
00:42:34,721 --> 00:42:38,492
This is Morning Light.

My gift to you for passing
the first challenge.

452
00:42:51,605 --> 00:42:54,008
It's easy
to shoot with a gun,

453
00:42:54,141 --> 00:42:58,078
but the sword
is a weapon of honor.

It suits you.

458
00:43:15,063 --> 00:43:18,665
Hey, there was nothing in that
brochure about a nuclear jewel.

459
00:43:18,799 --> 00:43:20,334
Only a few have access.

and me.

462

Seems like a lot of protocol
for a fairy tale.

463
00:43:29,077 --> 00:43:32,546
Not protocol.
There's a DNA lock.

464
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:35,782
Like I said,
blood matters to my family.

[chuckles] You.

469
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:03,937
I was going for a walk.

Mm. With a sword?

471
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:12,512
I thought it was time to
get serious about my training.

472
00:45:12,646 --> 00:45:15,449
That's Morning Light,
a weapon of honor.

What makes you think
you deserve it?

What makes you think
you can use it?

475
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:22,656
How hard could it be?

476
00:45:23,423 --> 00:45:24,791
Let's find out.

477
00:45:30,464 --> 00:45:32,933
- How'd you get that scar?
- How did you get your name?

478
00:45:33,067 --> 00:45:35,136
I'll tell you when
you get to know me better.

479
00:45:35,268 --> 00:45:36,937
If you live that long.

480
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:42,442
- How about a wager?
- I'm all ears.

481
00:45:43,543 --> 00:45:46,346
Land one blow on me
and I won't cut them both off.

482
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,849
And if I lose?

483
00:45:48,982 --> 00:45:53,020
- You tell me why you're here.
- I thought I did. We're training.

484
00:45:53,653 --> 00:45:55,255
Here with the Arashikage.

485
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:00,627
- You're on.
- Hit me.

Come at me like you mean it.

489
00:46:24,951 --> 00:46:27,387
It's not your skill that's
lacking, it's your heart.

490
00:46:27,521 --> 00:46:31,025
If your heart is pure,
our secrets will reveal themselves to you.

If not...

they'll be your end.

Are you sure it's Kenta?

He found a new way
to bring his guns to Japan.

He's taking delivery
of a shipment tonight.

So what's the deal with Cobra?

The deal is,

561
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,170
they're a secret network of
terrorist cells, crime syndicates,

And we have something you want.

It is a mirror

Even if it causes you more pain,
you must unburden yourself.

01:05:45,812 --> 01:05:47,814
You don't know
what this place means to me.

659
01:05:47,948 --> 01:05:50,717
I owe the Arashikage everything.

660
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:53,154
I never knew family
before I arrived here.

661
01:05:53,753 --> 01:05:55,922
Can you understand that?

662
01:06:10,371 --> 01:06:13,473
You want to know why
I've been a ghost for so long?

663
01:06:18,212 --> 01:06:20,647
My father was murdered
when I was a kid.

664
01:06:21,881 --> 01:06:25,453
When I tried to find out why,
it was as if he didn't exist.

665
01:06:25,585 --> 01:06:27,854
False identities, false papers.

666
01:06:27,988 --> 01:06:30,790
Everything about him was a lie.

667
01:06:33,626 --> 01:06:35,096
Even my own name.

668
01:06:42,269 --> 01:06:44,537
That's why
I couldn't find you.

669
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:48,842
If I pass
the third challenge...

670
01:06:50,277 --> 01:06:52,246
I'm Arashikage, right?

671
01:06:53,314 --> 01:06:54,981
If you pass.

672
01:06:55,815 --> 01:06:57,517
I have to pass.

673
01:06:59,919 --> 01:07:04,225
I've done unforgivable things I
wish I could tell you, but I can't.

674
01:07:05,658 --> 01:07:07,660
But if I could become
part of this family,

675
01:07:07,794 --> 01:07:09,196
be its protector...

676
01:07:11,132 --> 01:07:13,100
I think
that would make it right.

677
01:07:21,608 --> 01:07:23,843
Then empty your heart.

678
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,416
Whatever you're hiding
in there,

679
01:07:28,548 --> 01:07:30,917
the challenge
will see right through it.

680
01:07:36,556 --> 01:07:38,591
[door closes]

681
01:07:38,725 --> 01:07:40,994
[Blind Master] <i>I see that
you have a clouded mind.</i>

682
01:07:41,128 --> 01:07:44,198
You live on both sides
of the mirror.

683
01:07:44,331 --> 01:07:47,834
Only you know whether
you are ready to take this test.

684
01:07:47,967 --> 01:07:50,637
Be certain
that you wish to proceed.

685
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:52,906
Once the third challenge
begins,

686
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:55,009
there is no turning back.

687
01:07:58,145 --> 01:07:59,346
I'm sure.

688
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:04,452
Those who pass are
accepted into the Arashikage.

689
01:08:04,584 --> 01:08:06,586
If you survive,
you will gain access

690
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:09,923
to our knowledge
and our power.

691
01:08:10,957 --> 01:08:14,861
But you must swear loyalty
to our clan.

692
01:08:14,994 --> 01:08:17,231
Do you accept
this condition?

693
01:08:19,366 --> 01:08:20,934
I do.

694
01:08:28,808 --> 01:08:30,277
What do I do
when I get down there?

695
01:08:30,411 --> 01:08:32,480
[Blind Master]
There is a particular tile.

696
01:08:32,612 --> 01:08:35,282
Step on it
and wait for judgment.

697
01:08:35,416 --> 01:08:36,716
[chuckles]

698
01:08:38,185 --> 01:08:39,286
Something funny?

699
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:41,255
You will see,

700
01:08:41,388 --> 01:08:42,755
Snake.

701
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:14,021

[roaring]

704
01:10:02,069 --> 01:10:04,371
Giant anacondas
as old as time.

705
01:10:04,505 --> 01:10:07,308
They never harm
those who are pure of heart.

706
01:10:07,441 --> 01:10:09,143
What about everybody else?

707
01:10:09,276 --> 01:10:11,711
[hissing]

01:10:18,385 --> 01:10:20,421

[hissing]

710
01:11:03,097 --> 01:11:05,132
Empty your heart.

711
01:11:40,534 --> 01:11:41,801
[chuckles]

712
01:11:57,785 --> 01:11:59,019
[grunts]

713
01:12:18,672 --> 01:12:19,906
Go!

714
01:12:23,544 --> 01:12:24,545
Go!

715
01:12:31,785 --> 01:12:33,986
[roaring]

716
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:53,006
She knows our rules.
She will be punished.

717
01:12:53,873 --> 01:12:56,009
- Grandmother...
- You brought him among us.

718
01:12:56,143 --> 01:12:58,379
The fault
is not hers alone.

719
01:12:59,713 --> 01:13:00,947
No, Sen-san.

720
01:13:02,583 --> 01:13:04,351
The fault is mine.

721
01:13:05,052 --> 01:13:07,020
Explain yourself.

722
01:13:07,154 --> 01:13:10,290
The penalty of lying is death.

723
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,395
We are all listening.

724
01:13:20,167 --> 01:13:22,001
My heart is not pure.

725
01:13:23,036 --> 01:13:24,571
I seek vengeance.

726
01:13:25,839 --> 01:13:27,441
My father
was murdered.

727
01:13:28,308 --> 01:13:30,411
I have dedicated my life

728
01:13:30,544 --> 01:13:32,912
to finding the man
who did it...

729
01:13:33,913 --> 01:13:35,449
and killing him.

730
01:13:40,821 --> 01:13:45,259
[inhales, exhales]
This is all I've ever wanted.

731
01:13:51,298 --> 01:13:53,066
He speaks the truth.

732
01:13:54,835 --> 01:13:57,271
Your honesty
wins you your life,

733
01:13:57,937 --> 01:14:00,174
but not among
the Arashikage.

734
01:14:16,757 --> 01:14:18,125
Snake!

735
01:14:59,867 --> 01:15:01,401
You should have told me.

736
01:15:02,135 --> 01:15:04,404
We could have been brothers.

737
01:15:05,806 --> 01:15:07,608
I know I failed you.

738
01:15:08,742 --> 01:15:12,112
You are the only brother
I've ever known.

739
01:15:12,246 --> 01:15:15,182
And I would pay you back
with my life if I had to.

740
01:16:08,602 --> 01:16:10,170
Keep it.

741

I was hoping
you wouldn't do that.

01:20:17,884 --> 01:20:19,419
Akiko.

752
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:23,157
Still want to know
how I got my scar?

753
01:20:23,291 --> 01:20:25,092
From the last man I trusted.

754
01:20:25,959 --> 01:20:28,762
Trust is a hard thing to
come by these days.

755
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,800
Time for you to learn a lesson.

[alarm continues blaring]

You have placed
the clan at risk.

760
01:21:15,209 --> 01:21:16,776
You must atone.

761
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:19,746
We will return
the Jewel...

762
01:21:22,049 --> 01:21:25,119
and bring you the head
of Snake Eyes.

[Baroness] So?

Do you have it?

766
01:21:52,445 --> 01:21:54,948
You're gonna start a war
with the Arashikage, aren't you?

767
01:21:55,082 --> 01:21:56,783
What do you care?

768
01:21:58,685 --> 01:22:02,589
Remember our deal,
and you will get what I promised.

Who are you?

You killed my dad.

779
01:24:54,528 --> 01:24:57,431
You're going to have to be
a little more specific.

780
01:24:58,065 --> 01:25:01,135
I killed a lot of people.

Okay, okay. All right.

791
01:25:44,545 --> 01:25:47,780
Now I remember you.
You attacked me, tried to save your dad.

792
01:25:47,914 --> 01:25:49,916
Why did you kill him?

793

I was.

Until three weeks ago,

01:26:12,273 --> 01:26:15,775
when that bitch dragged me
off a chopper at gunpoint.

799
01:26:20,247 --> 01:26:24,751
You must be a big man for
the Baroness to hand me over.

800
01:26:29,989 --> 01:26:31,891
Let's go. Let's do this.

Follow him.

01:27:33,853 --> 01:27:35,289
[Tommy] What's he doing?

807
01:27:35,422 --> 01:27:37,458
[Akiko] Looks like he's
heading back to the castle.

[horn honking]

[speaking Japanese]
I need backup!

01:28:22,369 --> 01:28:25,506
Did you see that?
Snake's fighting on our side.

812
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:51,265
Tommy, listen to me.

813
01:28:51,398 --> 01:28:54,435
Kenta's got the Jewel
and is headed for the castle.

814
01:28:54,568 --> 01:28:55,736
Can you hear me?

815
01:28:55,868 --> 01:28:57,204
Tommy! Akiko!

816
01:28:57,338 --> 01:28:58,572
Shit!

[guards shouting]

818
01:29:29,803 --> 01:29:31,003
We have to keep you safe.

819
01:29:31,138 --> 01:29:32,872
Nothing matters
but the safety of the clan.

820
01:29:33,006 --> 01:29:34,408
You are the clan!

821
01:29:34,541 --> 01:29:36,477
I am nothing by myself.

01:30:48,282 --> 01:30:50,250
I guess the party started early.

826
01:31:13,407 --> 01:31:16,510
- He needs help.
- He deserves to die.

827

[shouts]

832
01:33:08,088 --> 01:33:11,391
We have to stop Kenta.
He has the Jewel.

833
01:33:12,292 --> 01:33:14,428
[gunfire]

834
01:33:16,496 --> 01:33:18,765
This isn't over.

835
01:33:30,044 --> 01:33:32,879
Leave! Now!

836
01:34:09,249 --> 01:34:11,618
I am the Arashikage.

837
01:34:13,553 --> 01:34:15,589
This is a terrible idea.

838
01:34:40,947 --> 01:34:44,284
[panting]

839
01:34:48,268 --> 01:34:51,062
[speaking Japanese]
You have fought bravely

840
01:34:52,188 --> 01:34:53,899
I give you my word,
your end will be swift and painless

841
01:34:53,978 --> 01:34:58,331
Very noble.
But the promise is not yours to make.

842
01:35:02,070 --> 01:35:03,236
The Jewel.

843
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:05,338
The clan is destroyed.

844
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:07,474
We kept our side
of the bargain.

845
01:35:07,607 --> 01:35:09,743
I trust you'll keep yours.

846
01:35:15,348 --> 01:35:19,453
With this jewel,
Cobra will be invincible.

847
01:35:21,855 --> 01:35:23,757
[Kenta]
Maybe I'll just keep it.

848
01:35:23,890 --> 01:35:25,559
No good deed, huh?

849
01:35:26,259 --> 01:35:27,360
Shut up.

850
01:35:27,494 --> 01:35:29,930
Cobra will annihilate you.

851
01:35:33,734 --> 01:35:37,370
You protect my grandmother.
I'll go after the Jewel.

852
01:35:39,906 --> 01:35:42,009
When you cast me out,

853
01:35:42,143 --> 01:35:45,779
I warned you
this day would come.

854
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:47,914
Kneel.

855
01:35:51,219 --> 01:35:52,719
Very well, then.

856
01:35:55,123 --> 01:35:56,356
Die.

857
01:35:58,759 --> 01:36:01,428
We're under attack!
It's Tommy.

858
01:36:06,134 --> 01:36:07,367
Snake.

859
01:36:09,302 --> 01:36:10,771
[Scarlett clears throat]

860
01:36:14,041 --> 01:36:16,743
- You're in a tight spot, huh?
- I've been in worse.

861
01:36:16,877 --> 01:36:19,279
Still, I'd like to propose
a very temporary alliance.

862
01:36:19,412 --> 01:36:21,648
All right.
But when it's over, I walk.

863
01:36:21,782 --> 01:36:24,384
Not a chance,
but I'll give you a head start.

864
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:42,536
[shouting, grunting]

865
01:36:46,207 --> 01:36:50,044
You're losing your touch.
I saw you a mile away.

866
01:36:51,578 --> 01:36:52,879
Sure you did.

867
01:36:53,014 --> 01:36:55,982
[Hard Master] Good of you
to join us, Tommy-san.

868
01:36:56,117 --> 01:36:57,784
And just in time.

869
01:36:58,852 --> 01:37:00,554
I count 20 men.

870
01:37:01,222 --> 01:37:02,156
[sighs]
Heavy odds.

871
01:37:02,290 --> 01:37:04,058
Yeah. For them.

872
01:37:04,424 --> 01:37:06,660
[shouting]

873
01:37:31,952 --> 01:37:33,054
Snake Eyes,

874
01:37:33,187 --> 01:37:36,857
betray our trust again,
I'll kill you myself.

875
01:37:38,358 --> 01:37:39,693
What is she doing here?

876
01:37:39,826 --> 01:37:42,963
Let's just say our goals
are temporarily aligned.

877
01:37:46,234 --> 01:37:47,667
[Baroness] Just for tonight.

878
01:37:56,177 --> 01:37:57,510
[groans]

879
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,010
[shouts]

880
01:38:29,143 --> 01:38:30,477
They're mine.

01:40:05,439 --> 01:40:06,873
Yo, Joe.

[all shouting]

885
01:40:13,747 --> 01:40:16,150

- Mm-hmm.

Fuck this.

889
01:41:08,269 --> 01:41:12,273
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

890
01:41:52,146 --> 01:41:53,347
[Sen] Tommy!

891

[shouts]

892
01:42:03,390 --> 01:42:05,792
Tommy-san, no! Tommy-san!

893
01:42:26,779 --> 01:42:28,315
Kenta's gone.

894
01:42:30,618 --> 01:42:31,851
Where's Snake?

895
01:43:08,522 --> 01:43:10,124
[Kenta] Just stay down.

896
01:43:30,743 --> 01:43:32,112
[groans]

01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:41,322
Abandon ego.

[grunts]

900
01:43:44,391 --> 01:43:46,427
Practice selflessness.

901
01:43:49,496 --> 01:43:52,233
Strike with honor.

902
01:43:53,667 --> 01:43:56,403

This is where you die.

[hissing]

914
01:46:44,438 --> 01:46:46,607
The Jewel of the Sun
is secure.

915
01:46:54,081 --> 01:46:56,283
And it always will be.

916
01:46:57,317 --> 01:47:00,087
At least
for another generation.

917
01:47:04,525 --> 01:47:08,462
I will be the last of our family
to lead the Arashikage.

918
01:47:11,131 --> 01:47:12,566
But Sen-sama...

919
01:47:15,935 --> 01:47:18,105
I had no choice.

920
01:47:20,274 --> 01:47:23,710
I only used the Jewel
to defend our people.

921
01:47:24,411 --> 01:47:26,213
There is always a choice.

922
01:47:26,346 --> 01:47:29,917
Our clan swore an oath
to never use the Jewel,

923
01:47:30,050 --> 01:47:31,951
only to protect it.

924
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:34,688
You can never...

925
01:47:37,057 --> 01:47:38,358
lead the clan.

926
01:47:38,492 --> 01:47:39,226
With respect...

927
01:47:39,359 --> 01:47:41,261
Remember your vows,
Tommy,

928
01:47:41,395 --> 01:47:44,298
to forever serve the clan
in any capacity.

929
01:47:44,431 --> 01:47:45,632
"Serve"?

930
01:47:50,704 --> 01:47:52,139
[shouts] Serve?

931
01:47:54,942 --> 01:47:59,780
I have given my life
to this clan!

932
01:47:59,913 --> 01:48:02,349
I have sacrificed
everything!

933
01:48:02,483 --> 01:48:03,517
Tommy.

934
01:48:04,151 --> 01:48:07,154
It is my blood right!

935
01:48:17,731 --> 01:48:22,069
You offered me your life.

936
01:48:26,005 --> 01:48:28,242
Next time we meet...

937
01:48:29,776 --> 01:48:33,146
I will take it.

938
01:48:36,617 --> 01:48:38,352
Tomisaburo, wait.

939
01:48:40,521 --> 01:48:43,423
You will always
be a part of this family.

940
01:49:04,811 --> 01:49:06,413
I serve no one.

941
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:46,687
- I'm going after Tommy.
- I had a feeling you might.

942
01:49:47,454 --> 01:49:49,023
Are you sure that's wise?

943
01:49:49,156 --> 01:49:51,325
In his state,
who knows what he might do?

944
01:49:51,458 --> 01:49:53,560
That's why
I have to find him.

945
01:49:54,795 --> 01:49:56,630
This is all my fault.

946
01:49:56,763 --> 01:49:59,333
I have to do everything
I can to make it right.

947
01:50:00,601 --> 01:50:03,537
Well, this might be useful.

948
01:50:16,683 --> 01:50:18,251
Be careful.

949
01:50:18,385 --> 01:50:21,022
[clears throat]

950
01:50:21,154 --> 01:50:22,222
Excuse me.

951
01:50:22,356 --> 01:50:24,458
My commander,
General Joe Colton,

952
01:50:24,591 --> 01:50:27,127
wanted to share this
with you.

953
01:50:48,382 --> 01:50:49,916
I don't understand.

954
01:50:50,051 --> 01:50:52,786
Your father was one of us.
A Joe.

955
01:50:54,855 --> 01:50:56,256
He was a Joe?

956
01:50:56,390 --> 01:50:58,792
You'll find no record
of you in there.

957
01:50:58,925 --> 01:51:01,528
He kept you off the grid
to protect you.

958
01:51:03,064 --> 01:51:04,364
So why was he killed?

959
01:51:04,498 --> 01:51:06,767
Your father infiltrated
a Cobra cell.

960
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:08,869
But they found out.

961
01:51:09,002 --> 01:51:11,738
By the time we got there,
he was dead and you were gone.

962
01:51:13,206 --> 01:51:16,943
But you should know the intel he
provided saved thousands of lives.

963
01:51:18,512 --> 01:51:20,213
At the cost of his own.

964
01:51:20,347 --> 01:51:21,682
It was a price
he was willing to pay

965
01:51:21,815 --> 01:51:24,685
to make the world a safer place
for the rest of us.

966
01:51:24,818 --> 01:51:26,720
Safer for his son.

967
01:51:28,822 --> 01:51:31,491
He left some big shoes
to fill, your dad.

968
01:51:33,694 --> 01:51:36,630
It hasn't been easy finding
the right person to fill them.

969
01:51:36,763 --> 01:51:40,434
[chuckles] So you're
saying I could be a Joe?

970
01:51:40,567 --> 01:51:42,402
Anything's possible.

971
01:51:44,838 --> 01:51:46,873
We all make mistakes.

972
01:51:47,008 --> 01:51:49,676
It's what we do next
that really matters.

973
01:51:51,511 --> 01:51:54,715
When you're ready,
Akiko knows where to find us.

974
01:52:01,521 --> 01:52:03,790
There's something
I need to do first.

975
01:52:04,591 --> 01:52:07,394
Let's find Tommy
and bring him home.

976
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:55,742
Something to drink
before takeoff?

977
01:53:04,185 --> 01:53:05,919
I'm not here to kill you.

978
01:53:17,531 --> 01:53:19,432
I came to make you an offer.

979
01:53:24,437 --> 01:53:27,774
[scoffs]
You've lost an army, Tommy.

980
01:53:30,744 --> 01:53:32,679
But I can get you a better one.

981
01:53:40,587 --> 01:53:41,955
Storm Shadow.

982
01:53:47,961 --> 01:53:50,864
Call me Storm Shadow.
