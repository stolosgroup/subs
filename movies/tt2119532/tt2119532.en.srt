00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,711
<i>Have you not heard?</i>

3
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,795
<i>The Lord is the everlasting God,
the Creator of the ends of the Earth.</i>

4
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,671
<i>He will not grow tired or weary,</i>

5
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,639
<i>and His understanding no one can fathom.</i>

6
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,598
<i>He gives strength to the weary
and increases the power of the weak.</i>

7
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,359
<i>Even youths grow tired and weary,
and young men stumble and fall.</i>

8
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,673
<i>But those who hope in the Lord
will renew their strength.</i>

9
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,755
<i>They will soar on wings like eagles.</i>

10
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,639
<i>They will run and not grow weary.</i>

11
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,474
<i>They will walk and not be faint.</i>

12
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,239
Desmond, hang on!

13
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,750
Hang on, Desmond!

14
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,878
We're going to get you out of here!

15
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,711
Desmond. Desmond!

16
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,350
What?

17
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,433
- Wait up.
- Catch up.

18
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,876
Wait up, I've got something to tell you.

19
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,755
What, Hal?

20
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,274
Race you to the top.

21
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,953
Hey! Cheater!

22
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,998
- See you later, slowpoke.
- Hey!

23
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,269
- Want a hand?
- I got it.

24
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,794
- Sit down!
- Ah, you dope!

25
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,280
- Quit it.
- You quit it.

26
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,232
For Pete's sake.

27
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,597
Hey! Get away from that ledge,
you damn fool kids!

28
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,273
You're going to break your necks!

29
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,349
It's them Doss kids.
Crazy as their old man.

30
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,717
They dug up the corner
of Jackson and Main...

31
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,392
Putting in a sidewalk...

32
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,472
You boys wouldn't recognize it now.

33
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,950
Mind you, I doubt they'd recognize you.

34
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,837
They hardly know me when I walk by 'em.

35
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,351
It's like I died with you.

36
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,680
It's like we boys never existed.

37
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,040
Well, that's all I got for you today.

38
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,234
Block him with your right, Desmond.

39
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,512
Stop it! Do you hear me?

40
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,320
- What are they fighting about?
- When'd they ever need a reason?

41
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,392
Tom! Ugh!

42
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,551
Why stop 'em? Saves me whipping them both.

43
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,472
This way, I just whip the one that wins.

44
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,030
Tom!

45
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,236
No!

46
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,720
Oh, God.

47
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,397
Tom! Wake up, can you hear me?

48
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,596
What the hell have you done?

49
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,870
He can't hear me.

50
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,917
I'll get some ice.

51
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,479
- You shift that basket.
- I got it.

52
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,953
Is he breathing?

53
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,080
Hal? Hal, can you hear me?

54
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,478
Hal, can you hear me?

55
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,995
Hal... Come on.

56
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,719
He's dilated.

57
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,516
Hal...

58
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,790
What do you think you're doin'?

59
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,955
I'm gonna have to beat you now,
you know the rules.

60
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,510
You hear me, Desmond?

61
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,115
- Desmond!
- Tom, stop.

62
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,032
What's that gonna teach the boy?

63
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,555
He's violent enough already.

64
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,075
Okay, fine, you go smother him in kisses.

65
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,710
You tell him the world's
a soft and gentle place.

66
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,672
Hal's gonna be okay.

67
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,509
Hey.

68
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,752
- I could have killed him.
- Yes, you could have.

69
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,639
Murder, it's the worst sin of all.

70
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,200
And to take another man's life,

71
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,990
that is the most egregious sin
in the Lord's sight.

72
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,915
Nothing hurts his heart so much.

73
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,360
Don't you understand English?

74
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,798
Do I have to tell you again?

75
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,917
You move, woman,
or I will wallop you good and hard!

76
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,832
What the hell's going on?
You okay, Bertha?

77
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,274
You mind your own damned business!

78
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,511
Go sleep it off, Tom.

79
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,880
I hate him.

80
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,480
Momma?

81
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,950
Oh.

82
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,271
Why does he hate us so much?

83
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,155
Oh, he don't hate us.

84
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,671
He hates himself sometimes.

85
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,954
Your daddy tonight,
that ain't the real him.

86
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,200
I wish you knew him
like I did, before the war.

87
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,680
<i># Praise the Lord</i>

88
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,117
<i># Praise the Lord</i>

89
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,477
<i># Let the people rejoice!</i>

90
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,677
<i># Oh, come</i>

91
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,198
<i># To the Father
Through Jesus the Son</i>

92
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,876
<i># And give him the glory</i>

93
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,876
<i># Great things he has done #</i>

94
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,599
How'd we sound, Desmond?

95
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,956
Like a heavenly host of angels, Mom.

96
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,716
Now, you know it's a sin to tell a lie,
especially in this place.

97
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,395
Well, I ain't never said
they were singing angels.

98
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,996
What's going on out there? Desmond!

99
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,117
Get it up, get it up!

100
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,512
Drag him out. Just the tarp.

101
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,189
I'll phone an ambulance.

102
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,397
No, no time. Joshua's pickup.

103
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,834
- Quick!
- Okay.

104
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,720
You're going to be fine now.
You're going to be fine.

105
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,314
You're in good hands.

106
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,480
What have we got here?

107
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,040
It's a severed artery. Get some sutures.

108
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,196
Yes, doctor.

109
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,112
Put some pressure on it.
Did you apply this tourniquet?

110
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,316
- Yes, sir.
- Nice work.

111
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,880
You might have saved this boy's life.

112
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,000
You staying with us?
You're going to be okay.

113
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,673
What's your name, son?

114
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,752
Gilbert.

115
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,792
- Surgery?
- Yeah, surgery.

116
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,837
Stay with us, you're gonna be okay.

117
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,196
You feel pain?

118
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,112
Stay with us, okay?

119
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,555
Army physicals that way.
This is for giving blood.

120
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,275
Are you all right?

121
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,837
Oh, no, that's not mine. I'm fine.
Thank you for asking though, ma'am.

122
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,436
What do you need?

123
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,118
My belt.

124
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,679
I lent it to the boy who had the accident.

125
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,797
My pants don't hold up so good without it.

126
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,920
Well, uh, I don't have your belt.

127
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,559
No, I know that, ma'am. It's out there.

128
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,040
It's right out there with the boy still.

129
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,837
Okay. I'm just here to take blood.

130
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,674
I'll give mine.

131
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,832
Okay, go to that room over there
and wait with the others.

132
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,320
I'll call you.

133
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,879
That room.

134
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,871
You ever given blood before, Mr...

135
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,156
Doss.

136
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,955
But my friends call me Desmond.
No, ma'am, this is my first time.

137
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,434
I always dreamed about being a doctor.
But, uh, I didn't get much school.

138
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,309
You may be a little dizzy when we're done.

139
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,915
Is somebody picking you up?

140
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,196
No, ma'am. Walking back.

141
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,078
Where do you live?

142
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,480
Fort Hill, ma'am.

143
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,159
That's a ways.

144
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,553
No. Just five or six miles,
but I cut through the woods.

145
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,632
It's seven that way!

146
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,996
You must really like the woods.

147
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,072
Yes, ma'am. I sure do.

148
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,117
Okay, put some pressure here.

149
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,917
- You okay?
- Yeah.

150
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,110
Bye.

151
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,798
Where you going
looking all spruced and nice?

152
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,759
Met someone yesterday.
A nurse over at the hospital.

153
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,360
Her name's Dorothy Schutte.
I'm gonna marry her.

154
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,352
Goodness. Does she know that?

155
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,352
Well, not yet. She's about to.

156
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,559
You ever even spoken to a woman?
I mean, one that's not family.

157
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,070
Spoke to her.

158
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,356
Well, in that case,
come give your brother a big hug.

159
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,794
- Hal!
- Come here.

160
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,599
Keep your greasy paws off of me.

161
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,236
Wish me luck, Momma.

162
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,190
Good luck.

163
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,634
Next.

164
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,872
Grab a seat. You ever given blood before?

165
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,996
Yes, ma'am. I have.

166
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,912
You're the belt man.

167
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,514
Desmond, yes, ma'am.

168
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,399
Well, Desmond, we can't
take your blood two days in a row.

169
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,437
Well, that's good.
I came to get mine back.

170
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,876
- You what?
- My blood. I need it back.

171
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,035
Well, it don't work like that,
we can't just give it back to you.

172
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,191
Well, you got to.

173
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,951
Ever since you stuck me with that needle,
my heart's been beating real fast.

174
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,316
Every time I think about you,
it beats faster still.

175
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,433
I never heard that one before.
It's pretty corny.

176
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,552
It is?

177
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,917
That's a shame,
I done practiced that all night.

178
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,036
No good?

179
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,153
I didn't say that.

180
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,874
What's the difference
between an artery and a vein?

181
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,358
- What are you talking about?
- The boy's accident.

182
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,154
Arteries spurt blood.

183
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,640
And veins?

184
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,036
Bleed.

185
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,510
I think you need to practice

186
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,434
your boy/girl dating talk
at home before you come out.

187
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,352
Yeah, I probably do.

188
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,151
I'll give you a book
if you're that interested.

189
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,035
On dating?

190
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,077
On blood.

191
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,234
Another medical question perhaps?

192
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,631
No. I just think you're the
prettiest thing I ever seen.

193
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,271
That's because I'm sitting in the dark.

194
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,354
No, you're just beautiful.

195
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,913
Out of the way!

196
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,797
You need to watch where you're going.

197
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,393
I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd mind.

198
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,630
You didn't ask.

199
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,630
- I thought you might have liked it.
- Well, I might have if you'd asked.

200
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,436
You coming?

201
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,879
Watch where you're walking!

202
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,079
Why didn't you say nothing to us?

203
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,032
'Cause you would have tried
and talked me out of it,

204
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,392
- and I know what I'm doing is right.
- And what about His Commandment?

205
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,439
It's not killing in a war.
It's protecting.

206
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,318
Loads of boys from our church are going.

207
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,438
- Yeah.
- There is a war and they need men.

208
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,876
And working in a paper mill
ain't going to save this country.

209
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,038
Looks like a movie star, our boy.

210
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,679
Nice uniform, good hat.

211
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,279
Reminds me of how Artie Giddens looked
in his uniform when we went to France.

212
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,993
- Remember him, Bertha?
- Don't, Tom.

213
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,156
What?

214
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,358
I'm just saying how snappy
Artie looked in his uniform.

215
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,114
All you girls
certainly seemed to think so.

216
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,159
He had them flocking to him.
He was most proud.

217
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,958
I just hope that when our Hal gets shot,

218
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,555
it's through the front of his jacket.

219
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,758
Like a simple entry wound, not much mess.

220
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,639
Artie got hit in the back,

221
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,272
it blew most of his guts and intestines
out his front, offal everywhere.

222
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,756
Wrecked his uniform entirely.

223
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,154
It was lucky he was dead,

224
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,597
so he never knew
how awful his uniform looked.

225
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,879
Get outta of my sight.

226
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,958
What are you, part mountain goat?

227
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,516
Are you going to help me, Desmond Doss,

228
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,432
or are you just going
to leave me stranded?

229
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,514
I'll help you, but it's gonna cost you.

230
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,670
What?

231
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,230
A kiss.

232
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,634
- That is pure blackmail.
- Well, yes, ma'am, it is.

233
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,677
But that is still my condition.

234
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,354
That's the deal.
And I'm going to hold you to it.

235
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,318
Well, hold on now.

236
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,552
You ain't gonna slap me, are you?

237
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,996
'Cause I fall off,
I'm going to take you with me.

238
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,353
Kiss me and find out.

239
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,390
What?

240
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,598
I have to enlist.

241
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,395
I can't stay here while
all of them go fight for me.

242
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,314
- Yes, you can. You can stay here.
- Dorothy, I have to.

243
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,073
I want to be a medic.

244
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,356
I figure I'll be saving people,
not killing them.

245
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,676
I have to go to work.
I'm going to be late.

246
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,310
Dorothy. Dorothy, darling.
Dorothy. Dorothy!

247
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,752
So are you going to ask me
to marry you or what?

248
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,158
Well, I don't know.
You still going to have me?

249
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,392
Well, I wouldn't know, you haven't asked.

250
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,111
Well, I'm asking you,
with all my heart and then some.

251
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,240
- Will you marry me?
- Then, yes. Yes, I will.

252
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,400
When?

253
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,914
Soon as you get your first leave.

254
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,151
But I still don't like you at this moment.

255
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,278
- Yeah.
- Okay.

256
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,795
Okay. Well, I love you.

257
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,997
Shh!

258
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,549
Momma said come see you here.

259
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,710
Yeah.

260
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,076
These three were my best friends.

261
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,909
I grew up with 'em,

262
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,719
I got into trouble with 'em,
chased girls with 'em.

263
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,229
And I enlisted with 'em.

264
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,797
Now my friends are there,

265
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,552
covered in dirt and grass
and eaten by worms.

266
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,392
I don't want to have
to visit my sons here.

267
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,475
Daddy, I signed up already.

268
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,912
I couldn't do otherwise, Pop.
Everybody else is doing...

269
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,673
You ain't everybody else!

270
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,913
Everybody else jumps in
and does things quick, without thinking!

271
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,755
Like the damn idiot fools we were.

272
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,560
And soldiers who live,
they live because they can do that!

273
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,233
You can't!

274
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,595
Look, you gotta sit
and think and pray about everything.

275
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,639
I mean, look at you,
you're doing it right now.

276
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,791
You won't be able
to live with yourself if you go.

277
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,872
No, I won't be able
to live with myself if I don't.

278
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,920
I'm going to be a medic.
That's going to be my way to serve.

279
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,879
See, there you go, thinking it all out.

280
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,359
What, you figure this war is just
going to fit in with you, your ideas?

281
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,716
Well, I don't doubt it's going to be hard.

282
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,473
It won't be hard, it'll be impossible.

283
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,349
You know, whatever beliefs you have
in your crazy head now,

284
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,592
they won't ever play out.
It don't work that way.

285
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,673
And if by some, I don't know,
miracle chance you survive,

286
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,514
you won't be giving no thanks to God.

287
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,349
- Ready?
- Ready.

288
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,476
Y'all need some air.

289
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,517
Come on, fellas, shake a leg.
Uncle Sam's got you now.

290
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,991
Say goodbye to Momma. Come on.

291
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,476
Ladies, please, step away from the bus.

292
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,359
- I almost forgot. Here.
- Do I need a crowbar?

293
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,118
I want you to have this. It's mine.

294
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,551
You keep it right here, where I'll be.

295
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,997
- Bye.
- Bye.

296
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,633
I love you.

297
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,117
Hey, don't say that about my girl.

298
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,759
- What else...
- Hey. Oh.

299
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,150
Hey. Sorry, pal.

300
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,197
...means you're the person.

301
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,596
- They got me a bum steer.
- Nah, it's just a bum.

302
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,639
Do I have to gaze at your deformity
every time I walk to my bed?

303
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,360
Gaze upon it in envy, my friend.

304
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,557
You okay there?
You look lost. Vacancy right here.

305
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,077
Wise choice. It's got views of
the mountains down to the lake.

306
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,355
Randall Fuller.

307
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,399
Desmond Doss.

308
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,439
Call him "Teach." No one
understands a word he says.

309
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,318
That's because no one else here can read.

310
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,632
The testicles there belong to a man
calling himself "Hollywood."

311
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,155
They look like they belong
to a smaller guy.

312
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,833
You know testicles.

313
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,910
Oh! Hey, I just got these shoes.

314
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,198
Hey, uh, Grease Nolan, outta Red Hook.
Where you from?

315
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,959
- Virginia.
- Ooh, hillbilly, huh?

316
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,795
You marry your first cousin?
I'm just joking.

317
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,836
Whoa!

318
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,071
That's Smitty over there,
whipping Kirzinski's ass.

319
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,560
Like you were doing
any better, chowder head.

320
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,154
Hey, I didn't want to embarrass you.

321
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,197
Wal Kirzinski, nice to meet you.

322
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,239
Hey, beanpole,
what did you say your name was?

323
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,549
Desmond Doss.

324
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,913
That's Tex Lewis over there,
he thinks he's some kind of cowboy.

325
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,710
And, uh, Vito Rinnelli.
He may be small, but he is a bulldog.

326
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,075
- Hey.
- How you doing?

327
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,753
- Desmond.
- Yeah.

328
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,593
This handsome guy
right here is Lucky Ford.

329
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,670
Hey.

330
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,673
That's Walker and Pinnick over there
pretending they're card sharks.

331
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,160
Pipe down, Grease, all right?

332
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,391
Unless you want to
put your money where your mouth is.

333
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,194
Oh, hey, the old good book, right?

334
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,920
I think Lucky's got a good book.

335
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,151
- Right, Lucky?
- It's a good read.

336
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,751
Attention!

337
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,640
Line up! Move it!

338
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,076
Let's go, move it. Move it.

339
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,877
You are a very strange-looking individual

340
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,758
if you don't mind me saying so, Private.

341
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,036
- Name?
- Andy Walker.

342
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,793
How long have you been dead, son?

343
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,271
- Sir?
- I am not "Sir"!

344
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,230
I am Sergeant Howell or Sarge.
"Sir" you save for useless people.

345
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,392
- The name is "Ghoul," you say?
- Walker, Sergeant!

346
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,756
- Ghoul it is.
- Yes, Sergeant!

347
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,034
There's something off
in your presentation, Private.

348
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,958
Can't place it.

349
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,154
Is it your hair?

350
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,790
Is it the wrinkle in your trousers?

351
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,115
I have a knife in my foot, Sergeant.

352
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,030
Oh, yes, of course, that's it. The knife.

353
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,952
- What is your name, soldier?
- Smitty Ryker.

354
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,750
No, your name is Private Idiot.
Do you know why?

355
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,719
- Because I have a knife in my foot.
- Who placed the knife there, Private?

356
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,439
It was an accident, Sarge.
We was playing Stretch.

357
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,758
I am heartened by the knowledge you
did not place it there with intention.

358
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,674
Who threw the knife?

359
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,992
I did, Sergeant. Private Kirzinski.

360
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,790
You look part Indian.
To what tribe do you belong, son?

361
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,200
No, I'm Polish.

362
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,478
Wrong. I believe you must have
Cherokee or Shawnee blood in you.

363
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,279
- No, Sergeant.
- Are you contradicting me,

364
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,034
- you wagon-burning son of a bitch?
- No, Sergeant!

365
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,032
Let me see your Indian war cry, son.

366
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,236
I don't...

367
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,037
Louder! Let me see it.

368
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,914
What is your animal spirit?
Are you a garter snake?

369
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,434
- No, Sergeant!
- Are you a chipmunk?

370
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,989
- No, Sergeant!
- Are you a dancing reindeer?

371
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,311
- No, Sergeant!
- Are you contradicting me, Private?

372
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,040
- No, Sergeant!
- Good.

373
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,271
Then I shall henceforth call you "Chief"

374
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,591
as a sign of great respect to your people.

375
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,110
Thank you, Sergeant!

376
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,351
Are you grinning at me, boy,
or is that your natural state?

377
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,430
No, Sergeant.

378
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,716
- Name, Private?
- Desmond Doss.

379
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,395
I have seen stalks of corn
with better physiques.

380
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,870
Makes me want to pull an ear off, Private.

381
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,997
- Can you carry your weight?
- Yes, Sergeant!

382
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,231
Should be easy for you, then.

383
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,515
- Corporal.
- Sergeant.

384
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,831
Make sure you keep this man
away from strong winds.

385
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,990
Yes, Sergeant.

386
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,233
- Private Idiot.
- Yes, Sergeant.

387
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,596
Raise your foot. Higher.

388
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,159
Everyone outside. Now! Move it.

389
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,196
I said move it.

390
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,714
All right.
Just getting in my uniform, Sarge.

391
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,395
- Did I ask him to, Corporal?
- No memory of it, Sarge.

392
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,917
I believe any man who takes
such pride in his natural naked state

393
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,310
will surely enjoy
the brisk of the outdoors.

394
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,438
Now move your privates, Private Parts!

395
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,514
Move it! You son of an exhibitionist!

396
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,837
I am going to teach you
how to tie a bowline knot,

397
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,078
so you can get your sorry asses
down from a height,

398
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,277
so I may then kick them!

399
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,432
Create a loop. This is the rabbit hole.

400
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,150
The rabbit comes out of his hole,
runs around the tree,

401
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,871
goes back into the hole.
All right, let's go!

402
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,633
Very good, Tex.

403
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,475
Keep struggling, Teach.

404
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,074
Have you ever roped a goat, Hollywood?

405
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,076
No, Sarge.

406
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,833
Have you ever looked into a goat's eyes?

407
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,434
- No, Sarge.
- Good, that would be unnatural.

408
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,679
You know if you don't breathe, you'll die.

409
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,117
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good, Private Idiot.

410
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,320
Congratulations, Greaseball, you just
fell 50 feet and broke your neck!

411
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,155
Brilliant, Private Vito Rinnelli.

412
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,835
You strangled yourself, numb nuts!

413
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,673
- Are you a fan of Benito?
- No, Sergeant.

414
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,912
A bit taller.
If you were American, you'd be taller.

415
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,320
What've we got here, Doss,
one for each titty?

416
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,070
You were tying a bowline, boy,
not building a bra!

417
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,120
- What is so funny, Corporal?
- Couldn't tell you, Sergeant.

418
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,798
Come on! Come on, ladies,
pick it up! Move it! Move it!

419
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,520
I want to see some fire here.
A little hustle.

420
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,000
Show me something!

421
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,275
Run like you mean it!

422
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,114
- Down, down, down! Faster, faster!
- Come on. Move it! Move it!

423
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,715
Let's go, it's bath time, boys!
It's bath time!

424
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,912
Move! Move! Move!

425
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,071
I want to see you work. Let's go!

426
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,799
Dig, dig, dig!

427
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,349
Don't forget behind your ears.
Let's go. Move!

428
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,116
I bet you're enjoying this,
you naked degenerate.

429
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,398
Let's go! Hustle. Hustle. Hustle. Move!

430
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,591
Let's go! What are we waiting on?
Let's go! Move your ass!

431
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,639
Get the wood! Get the wall!
Don't get splinters!

432
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,120
Drive!

433
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,554
Drive!

434
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,915
Jeez, are you okay?

435
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,918
Yeah, I'm fine.

436
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,636
- Some spirit here, boys. Move!
- Come on, move!

437
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,633
What the hell is wrong
with you? No one said take a rest!

438
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,031
Move your asses to the finish line!
Move! Move!

439
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,918
Hustle! Hustle!

440
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,196
Get your asses across that line!

441
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,040
Time! Nice work, Doss!

442
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,677
This is a personal gift
from the United States government

443
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,433
to each and every one of you.

444
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,072
A standard issue U.S. rifle,
caliber.30, M1,

445
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,398
a clip-fed, shoulder-fired,
semi-automatic weapon

446
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,190
designed to bring death
and destruction to the enemy.

447
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,071
This is to be your lover,
your mistress, your concubine.

448
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,120
Perhaps the only thing in life
you will ever truly love.

449
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,079
Fellas, let's dance. Grab a girl.

450
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,512
Don't point your gun forward.

451
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,711
I do not want to be shot today.

452
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,076
No matter how much you are tempted.

453
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,072
Place the weapon by your side.

454
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,520
Pay attention.

455
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,754
Problem, Private Corn Stalk?

456
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,675
Is there not one in your size,
or is it the color that is the issue?

457
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,240
No, Sarge.

458
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,236
I was... I was told
I don't have to carry a weapon.

459
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,233
Come again? Step forward, Private.
I can't be hearing this right.

460
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,679
Well, I'm sorry, Sergeant.

461
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,352
I can't touch a gun.

462
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,674
What exactly is the problem?

463
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,877
No problem, just a mistake, sir.

464
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,997
I told the Army when I joined up.

465
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,673
That's not possible.

466
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,956
Do you know why
it's not possible, Private?

467
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,440
No, sir.

468
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,160
Because the United States Army
does not make mistakes.

469
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,439
So if there's a problem,
you must be that problem.

470
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,592
I was just never supposed to be sent
to a rifle company.

471
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,399
He's a C.O., sir.

472
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,155
You're a conscientious objector,
and you joined the Army?

473
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,519
Well, no, sir,
I'm a conscientious cooperator.

474
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,520
- Are you screwing with me, Doss?
- No. No, sir. I volunteered.

475
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,399
I ain't got no problem
with wearing my uniform,

476
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,517
or saluting the flag and doing my duty.

477
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,674
It's just carrying a gun
and the taking of human life.

478
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,510
- You don't kill? That's all.
- Yes, sir, that's all.

479
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,240
You know quite a bit
of killing does occur in a war?

480
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,356
Yes, sir.

481
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,397
I mean,
that is the essential nature of war.

482
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,712
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

483
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,111
Do you have any other requirements
of the United States Army?

484
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,953
Is there anything else
that we can do to ensure

485
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,633
that you have
a comfortable stay here with us?

486
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,594
He doesn't want to work on Saturdays, sir.

487
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,952
Well, Saturdays...
I'm a Seventh-day Adventist.

488
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,035
So, Saturday is my Sabbath,
so I'm not allowed to work then.

489
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,555
I don't think that poses a problem,
do you, Sergeant?

490
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,235
We shall simply ask the enemy
not to invade on the Sabbath,

491
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,079
'cause Private Doss here is at prayer.

492
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,880
All right. Now we got that clear.

493
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,272
Now let me tell you my requirements.

494
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,559
They're not as complicated as yours.
They're very simple.

495
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,599
As long as you're in this company,
under my command,

496
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,717
you will obey my orders. Period.

497
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,390
If you can't do it here,
I can't trust you to do it in battle.

498
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:54,758
I'm putting you in for
a Section 8, psychiatric discharge.

499
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,990
Dismissed.

500
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,792
Gentlemen!

501
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,634
I want you to meet Private Desmond Doss.

502
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,873
Apparently, Private Doss
does not believe in violence.

503
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,838
He does not practice violence.

504
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,152
He will not even deign to touch a weapon.

505
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,792
You see, Private Doss
is a conscientious objector.

506
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,797
So I plead with you, do not look to him
to save you on the battlefield,

507
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,314
because he will undoubtedly be too busy
wrestling with his conscience to assist.

508
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,791
- Sarge, that's not true.
- Private, as you were.

509
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,516
Now, I realize some of you
might have strong feelings about this.

510
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,831
It is what we men fight for.

511
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,790
To defend our rights,
and to protect our women and children.

512
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,877
Even if Private Doss' beliefs
might cause women and children to die.

513
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,475
So I will expect everyone in this company

514
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,839
to give Private Doss
the full measure of respect he is due

515
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,879
for the short time he will be with us.

516
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,514
Am I clear?

517
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,080
Yes, Sergeant.

518
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,840
What'cha got there, Dessie?

519
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,995
You know what that is.

520
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,197
It just seems kind of small.

521
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,919
It's half the Bible for half the man.

522
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,593
For Pete's sake, Smitty,
give him back his Bible.

523
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,319
I don't remember speaking to you.

524
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,837
So, how come you don't fight?
You think you're better than us?

525
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,596
No.

526
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,875
What if you was attacked?

527
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,074
Whoa!

528
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,110
Say, like that.

529
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,954
The Bible says to turn
the other cheek, don't it?

530
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,718
See, I don't think this is a question
of religion, fellas.

531
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,555
I think this is cowardice,
plain and simple.

532
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,674
Is that right, Doss?
Are you chickenshit, that it?

533
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,793
Go on, take a poke.

534
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,914
Tell you what, I'm going to
give you a free shot.

535
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,876
Right there.

536
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,080
Hit me, Doss. Go on.

537
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,554
- Let him have it.
- Go ahead.

538
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,676
No?

539
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,233
Chickenshit.

540
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,636
Oh.

541
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,795
Hold on here. What is this?

542
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,240
Give me that.

543
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,152
- This is a fine-looking broad.
- Nice.

544
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,799
Hey, pass it around.

545
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,920
Now, this would be the kind of
broad that deserves a real man.

546
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,316
Give me that back.

547
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,550
Please.

548
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,153
Please.

549
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,630
"Please give it back, Smitty."

550
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,677
Please give it back, Smitty.

551
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,437
Do you hear voices, Desmond?

552
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,119
No, sir.

553
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,830
But I understand that God
talks to you. Is that right?

554
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,639
Sir, I'm not a crazy person.

555
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,431
Is that how you feel most people
regard you, a crazy person?

556
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,319
I'm different. I know that, but...

557
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,391
I'm not going to pretend
to be something I'm not.

558
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,433
- I am what I am.
- Sounds lonely.

559
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,549
You lonely?

560
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,074
- So, you don't hear voices.
- No, sir.

561
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,436
I pray to God and I like to think He
hears me, but it ain't a conversation,

562
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,354
like the one we're pretending
to have right now.

563
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,272
- Pretending, Private?
- Well, yes, sir.

564
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,512
I know all you really want to do is give
me a Section 8, drum me out of the Army,

565
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:57,073
but I'm not off up above.
I just simply believe what I believe.

566
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,120
Well, I'm trying to understand, all right?

567
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,160
Was it God who told you
not to pick up a rifle?

568
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,358
God says not to kill.

569
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,233
That's one of His
most important Commandments.

570
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,870
Most people take that to mean,
"Don't commit murder."

571
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,317
War is a completely different
set of circumstances.

572
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,872
Jesus said,
"A new Commandment I give unto you,

573
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,953
that you love one another,
just as I have loved you."

574
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,197
This is Satan himself we're fighting.

575
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,557
Surely, as a good Christian,
you can see that.

576
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,031
I can see that, sir,
and that is why I joined up.

577
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,234
But I'm sorry, I will not bear arms.

578
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,994
His religious views are certainly unique,

579
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,596
but they do not constitute grounds
for a Section 8 discharge.

580
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,718
How am I supposed to maintain discipline
with a man like that in my unit?

581
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,280
I don't know.

582
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,636
But he is a legitimate
conscientious objector,

583
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,076
and he must be allowed
to work as a combat medic,

584
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,710
provided he qualifies
in all other areas of his training.

585
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,477
Perhaps we could help
make believe in his idea.

586
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,234
Yeah, you restrict him to barracks and KP.

587
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,676
If he throws God at you,
you throw hell right at him.

588
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,035
I want him gone.

589
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,591
Doss, your area is a disgrace.
It's a pig sty!

590
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,513
- Something funny, Ryker?
- No, Sarge!

591
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,150
- You got some shit on your mind?
- No, Sarge!

592
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,791
What you men fail to recognize

593
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,636
is a unit is no better
than its weakest member!

594
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,033
Now, to help you learn that lesson,
there will be no passes this weekend.

595
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,555
You will all be on KP!

596
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,031
Right now, everybody in full gear
for a 20-mile hike.

597
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,760
Let's go! Let's go.

598
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,637
Get your heads right.

599
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,956
Don't start feeling sorry for yourself.

600
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,112
Makes me sick
see you feel sorry for yourself.

601
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,510
You dogs don't know what tired is.

602
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,796
We're going to keep going till I drop.

603
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,672
Hey, knock it off. Trying to sleep here.

604
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,070
- Get off me. Get off me.
- Okay. All right.

605
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,673
Why the hell are you still here?

606
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,514
As you were.

607
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,116
Where's Doss?

608
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,199
This isn't good for anybody.

609
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,272
Sure ain't what I joined up for.

610
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,754
It's not about what you joined up for.

611
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,355
It's about the lives of every man in here.

612
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:42,914
And yours, son. It's time to quit this.

613
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,039
Finish getting dressed
and I'll walk you down.

614
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,039
It's okay, Doss.

615
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,154
There's no shame in this.

616
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,558
Let's go.

617
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,871
I got extra guard duty today,
and I'm on KP this morning, so...

618
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,870
Can't.

619
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,959
All right, Doss.

620
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,119
Private Doss, can you identify
the men that beat you?

621
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,872
No, Sarge.

622
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,112
Are you saying that you
don't know who attacked you?

623
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,112
I never said I was attacked, Sarge.

624
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,713
Well, what the hell are you saying, Doss?

625
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,951
You bruised half your body sleeping?

626
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,952
I... I sleep pretty hard.

627
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,513
Alright.

628
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,116
If you plan on getting wet this weekend,
make sure you put on a hat.

629
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,640
Next.

630
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,837
Don't want anyone
coming back pissing cream.

631
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,196
What, you don't want none
for your coffee, Sarge?

632
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,840
How about a shot right now, Smitty?

633
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,838
- You speaking from experience, Sarge?
- Next.

634
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,997
You'd have to ask
your mom about that, Greaseball.

635
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,876
At ease.

636
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,435
Private Doss, I'm afraid
I can't authorize your pass.

637
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,997
This is a furlough for men
who have passed the basic training.

638
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,276
Well, sir, respectfully, sir, I have.

639
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,190
I put in for this furlough
three weeks ago.

640
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,476
I'm getting married this afternoon.

641
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,439
It says you're not rifle qualified.

642
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,440
Well, I'm not required to carry
a rifle, sir. Colonel Stelzer, he...

643
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,752
Colonel Stelzer's determination was...

644
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,714
"Doss must be allowed to
work as a combat medic,

645
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:13,119
provided he qualifies
in all other areas of his training."

646
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,999
And you have not qualified
on the rifle range, Private.

647
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,036
Pretty clear.

648
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:26,229
Show me you know how to handle a rifle
and I'll sign your furlough.

649
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,232
- Corporal Cannon.
- Sir!

650
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,477
Hand Private Doss your firearm.

651
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,119
- I won't touch a rifle, sir.
- I'm not asking you, Private!

652
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,876
That is a direct order
from a company commander.

653
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:54,196
For God's sake, Doss,
you stop this nonsense and quit.

654
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:59,230
Refuse, and I will have no
recourse but to court-martial you,

655
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,711
and you will spend the duration
of the war in a military prison.

656
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,117
I can't, sir.

657
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,999
How much longer would you
like to wait, Dorothy?

658
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,790
I think it's been long enough.

659
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,912
I'm so very sorry.

660
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,310
Sometimes men just get cold feet.

661
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,514
Some men might. Not my Desmond.

662
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,159
You probably think
I'm a real son of a bitch

663
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,994
who cares only about regulations
and not his men.

664
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,110
May I?

665
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,074
I believe in this book as much as any man.

666
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,880
And just like any man,
I wrestle with my conscience,

667
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,670
but what do you do when everything
you value in this world is under attack?

668
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,519
I don't know, sir.

669
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,158
I ain't got answers to questions that big,

670
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,916
but I also feel like
my values are under attack,

671
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,554
and I don't know why.

672
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:53,634
I don't give a rat's ass about your
principles because the Japs don't.

673
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,951
If one of them attacks you
and some wounded soldier,

674
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,030
what are you gonna do?

675
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,077
Hit him with your Bible?

676
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,391
I'm prepared to give my life for my men.

677
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,030
You don't win wars by giving up your life.

678
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:10,956
Look, I'm only here because I don't want
to see you rotting in a prison cell.

679
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,600
Plead guilty, throw yourself
at the mercy of the court.

680
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,399
Maybe they'll let you go home and pray.

681
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,040
Let the brave men out there
go and win this war.

682
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,560
If I can't convince you, maybe she can.

683
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,034
They wouldn't let me call you.

684
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,959
I knew it wasn't your making.

685
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,751
What have they done to you?

686
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,599
It's okay, I'm all right.

687
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,912
I just went a couple of
rounds with the wall and lost.

688
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,198
They're saying you could
go to prison, Desmond.

689
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,317
Leavenworth.

690
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,312
There must be some other way.

691
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,232
I don't know what that could be.

692
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,437
I've done everything they asked me,
except this one thing,

693
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,115
and I'm being treated like
a criminal just 'cause I won't kill.

694
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,513
You tried. Nobody can say you didn't.

695
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,239
But who are you going to save in prison?

696
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,756
Probably nobody.

697
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,634
Then why can't you just pick up
the stupid gun and wave it around?

698
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,440
You don't have to use it,
just meet them halfway.

699
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,710
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can. It's just pride.

700
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,759
Pride and stubbornness.
Don't confuse your will with the Lord's.

701
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,719
Have I been prideful?

702
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,319
Maybe I am prideful.

703
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,353
But I don't know how
I'm going to live with myself

704
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,716
if I don't stay true to what I believe.

705
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,231
Much less how you could live with me.

706
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,757
I'd never be the man
that I want to be in your eyes.

707
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,798
I fell in love with you
because you weren't like anyone else

708
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,792
and you didn't try to be.

709
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,837
Do not think for one moment
that you will disappoint me.

710
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,195
I will love you no matter what.

711
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,879
I don't know what he's gonna do.
He loses no matter what.

712
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,749
<i>They want him to plead guilty,</i>

713
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,991
<i>but then he'll get
a dishonorable discharge.</i>

714
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,676
Otherwise he fights them,
and he for sure goes to prison.

715
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,672
<i>Either way, they'll call him a coward</i>

716
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,399
<i>and I don't see how he can live with that.</i>

717
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,552
Well, thank you, Dorothy.

718
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,389
If you get to talk to him,

719
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,676
tell him that we love him
and that we're praying for him.

720
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,911
<i>We're praying for both of you.</i>

721
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,037
I will. Bye-bye.

722
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,158
<i>Tom, you're out of your mind,
you're delirious.</i>

723
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,754
<i>Of course, I'm out of my mind.</i>

724
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,639
<i>What do you think I am?
I'm out of my mind.</i>

725
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,598
<i>You leave this room.</i>

726
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,239
No, Tom! Put it down!

727
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,073
- Get away from me, woman!
- Hey!

728
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,439
I got that, sir.

729
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,234
May I help you, sir?

730
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,880
I wish to speak to
Brigadier General Musgrove.

731
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,794
Not without an appointment you can't.
That would be quite impossible.

732
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,397
Uh, if you would kindly tell him

733
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,269
Corporal Thomas Doss
would appreciate a brief word.

734
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,353
He's in a very important meeting.

735
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:38,480
I fought with him in France
at Belleau Wood. He was my captain.

736
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,352
Please, ma'am, it's most vital.

737
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,996
Thank you, ma'am.

738
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,953
There's a man out there, Tom Doss.

739
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,030
Doss?

740
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,516
Be over in a minute.

741
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,116
You'll be home safe and sound,
like nothing ever happened.

742
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,669
I love you.

743
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,631
This is a hearing into the matter
of Private Desmond Doss.

744
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,280
The charge is disobeying
a series of direct orders

745
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,555
from his commanding officer.

746
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,950
How says the defendant?

747
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,831
Private Doss wishes to enter
a "not guilty" plea.

748
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,597
Is that so, Private?
I thought this was agreed.

749
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,155
You wanted to enter
some sort of plea bargain.

750
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,429
- Yes, sir, but I changed my mind.
- Just like that?

751
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,200
You wish to proceed to a court-martial?

752
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,480
- Yes, sir.
- Ah.

753
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:32,713
Well, on your head, then, Private.
Proceed.

754
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:40,279
Your Honor, Private Doss
waves his morality at us

755
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,477
like it's some kind of badge of honor.

756
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:46,236
He flaunts his contempt by directly
disobeying a series of direct orders

757
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,549
from his commanding officer.

758
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,280
When the very best of our young men
are sacrificing their lives against...

759
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,431
- You okay?
- Yes.

760
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,159
Are they still deliberating?

761
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,435
Yes, sir.

762
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,273
Okay, now you go take this in there.

763
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,159
I can't. It's strictly military personnel.

764
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,640
Well, then you get
one of them to take it in.

765
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,996
They ain't out to help.
They're fixing to bury him.

766
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:12,518
There is only one question that any
military court need ask of the accused.

767
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:16,310
Do you deny disobeying
Colonel Sangston's direct orders?

768
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,357
Well, do you, Private?

769
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,798
- No, sir. I don't.
- Why are you contesting it, then?

770
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,152
Why is it so important to you, given
your refusal to even touch a weapon,

771
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,436
to serve in a combat unit?

772
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:40,356
Because when the Japanese attacked
Pearl Harbor, I took it personal.

773
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,391
Everyone I knew
was on fire to join up, including me.

774
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,755
There were two men in my home town...
declared 4-F unfit.

775
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,355
They killed themselves
because they couldn't serve.

776
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,438
I had a job in a defense plant
and I could've taken a deferment,

777
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,840
but that ain't right.

778
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,392
It isn't right that other men
should fight and die,

779
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,070
that I would just be sitting at home safe.

780
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,640
I need to serve.

781
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,279
I got the energy
and the passion to serve as a medic.

782
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,830
Right in the middle with the other guys.
No less danger, just...

783
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,072
While everybody else is taking life,
I'm going to be saving it.

784
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,796
With the world so set
on tearing itself apart,

785
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,872
it doesn't seem like
such a bad thing to me

786
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,429
to want to put a little bit
of it back together.

787
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,433
- Hmm.
- Sorry, sir, nobody's allowed to go...

788
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,591
No, you don't understand.
My son is the defendant.

789
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,194
I understand, sir, but nobody's allowed...

790
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,590
- I have information that's important.
- Sir, you are not allowed...

791
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,592
While the sentiments
expressed are laudable,

792
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,479
the facts of the charge
seem incontestable, so...

793
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,877
What the hell is going on out there?

794
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,280
Let him go.

795
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,470
- That's a Great War uniform.
- It is, sir.

796
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,472
Sir, I need to show you this.

797
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,678
With respect, sir, you are no longer
a member of the military.

798
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,639
You are unable to attend this hearing.
I'm sorry.

799
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,758
Is that truly the way it works, sir?

800
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:30,117
You fight for your country,
you lose so much that was dear to you,

801
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,112
and then you're done with?

802
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,510
The uniform is forgotten.
You have no voice.

803
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,509
You were at Lys?

804
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,751
I was, sir. And at Belleau Wood.

805
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,360
Twice decorated, I see.

806
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,318
Yes, sir.

807
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,835
I take it you are the Private's father.

808
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,798
I am, sir. Thomas Doss.

809
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,590
Then, as a former military man,
you know there are laws here...

810
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,320
Sir, I know the law and I know
my son is protected by those laws.

811
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,676
They are framed in our constitution.

812
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,752
And I believe in them, as he does.

813
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,117
They are why I went
and fought to protect them.

814
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,351
At least, that is what
I thought I was doing.

815
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,874
Because if it wasn't for that,

816
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,429
then I have no idea what the hell
I was doing there, sir.

817
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,552
Thank you, Corporal Doss.

818
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,160
Let me have the letter.

819
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,110
You must go.

820
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,555
"The defendant's rights
as a conscientious objector

821
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,677
are protected by an Act of Congress

822
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:48,595
and he cannot be compelled
to waive those rights.

823
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:53,197
That includes, in this case,
his disobeying orders to bear arms."

824
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,672
Signed, Brigadier General Musgrove,
War Services Commander, Washington, D.C.

825
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,080
Colonel?

826
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:07,758
- I withdraw the charges, sir.
- Then this case is dismissed.

827
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:11,151
Private Doss, you are free
to run into the hellfire of battle

828
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:14,199
without a single weapon
to protect yourself.

829
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,874
You may resume your duties
and begin training as a combat medic.

830
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,551
- Where is he?
- Gone. Straight after.

831
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,472
I begged him to stay.
I told him you'd want to see him.

832
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,677
No, I understand.

833
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,672
When you get home,
you tell him I love him.

834
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,399
Okay. Okay.

835
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:17,680
You better come home to me.

836
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,837
<i># Uncle Sam is mild</i>

837
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,559
<i># He's peaceful as a child</i>

838
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,433
<i># But never get him
riled or you'll be whipped #</i>

839
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,000
Hollywood, shut up.

840
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,514
Come on, pipe down.

841
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,319
- Shut up, man.
- Shut up!

842
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,471
I swear to God,
Hollywood, I will shoot you.

843
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,677
Put a sock in it, will you?
Save the crowing for when we get there.

844
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,672
Killjoy was here.

845
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,155
Give him room.

846
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,840
Clear! Clear! Move aside!

847
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,951
The 96th... or what's left of them.

848
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,838
These are the guys we're replacing.

849
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,475
- Seems good to me.
- Clear.

850
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,040
- As gold.
- Clear.

851
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,633
All clear, Sarge!

852
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,154
Captain Glover.

853
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,711
Lieutenant Manville, 96th.

854
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,678
We've been assigned to you, sir.

855
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,399
Okay.

856
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,517
- Let's get these men some chow.
- Yes, sir.

857
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,954
This is, uh, Sergeant Howell.

858
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,315
- Good to meet you, sir.
- Sit down.

859
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,436
Who's Doss?

860
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,240
Over there.

861
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:01,755
You Doss?

862
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,680
Irv Schecter.

863
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:16,354
You, and me and Page here are about the
only medics we got left in this area.

864
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,399
So, I guess we're gonna be
working together.

865
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,878
You just come off the line?

866
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,189
What's it like?

867
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,954
I said, what's it like?

868
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,279
Hacksaw.

869
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:37,480
We climbed up six times.
Six times, they threw us off.

870
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:43,674
Last time, there wasn't
anything left of the 96th.

871
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:47,995
They're animals.

872
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,032
Stinking animals.

873
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:54,271
Nips don't care if they live or die.

874
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:58,553
They want to die. They keep coming at you.

875
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,200
And they ain't never going to give up.

876
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,759
Never.

877
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,672
Here. Hey, buddy.

878
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:13,398
The Japs deliberately target the wounded.

879
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:16,473
Lose all your Red Cross markings.

880
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,791
Nips put a premium on shooting medics.

881
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,319
The white is a bull's-eye.

882
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,712
Here, I got you a new helmet.

883
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,399
One size fits all.

884
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,638
That's our objective. Hacksaw Ridge.

885
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:42,390
We take it, maybe we get Okinawa.

886
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,473
We get Okinawa, we take Japan.

887
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,310
Take a breather. Our pals in the Navy
are going to soften them up for us.

888
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,317
Nobody can survive that shit.

889
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,398
Oh, but they can.

890
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:44,239
Lieutenant, these bunkers here,
here and here, is that accurate?

891
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:48,239
Yeah, there's three...

892
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,877
Yes, sir, maybe a little further back,
but it's all...

893
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,517
It's all different up there.

894
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,353
<i>All clear, Captain.</i>

895
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,514
Gents, move out.

896
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,279
It's blood.

897
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,589
No shit.

898
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,472
We're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy.

899
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:45,950
Keep climbing.

900
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,518
Here, come on.

901
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,910
Coming through, make way. Out of the way.

902
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,795
- Brown.
- What?

903
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:27,950
Give this to Jessop.

904
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,030
Corporal!

905
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,476
Incoming!

906
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,075
Get down!

907
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:23,876
Get down!

908
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,675
Where the hell are they?
I can't see nothing.

909
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,156
- Beats me, pal.
- Where the...

910
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,960
Medic!

911
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,191
We're over here!

912
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,716
Put your hand right here.
Put your hand on there, Jack.

913
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,598
Come on, come on.

914
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,240
Come on, we're going to get you
under cover. Come on, come with me.

915
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,834
Come with me, Jack.

916
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,439
Keep moving forward! Move!

917
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,115
I can't see anything.

918
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,953
- Is that one?
- I don't know. Just shoot!

919
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:40,994
All right, let's go.

920
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:45,830
Vito!

921
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:51,954
Oh, shit.

922
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,629
- Medic! Vito's down!
- I'm coming!

923
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,791
Okay. I'm here.

924
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,076
Get out of the way!

925
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,550
You hurt?

926
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,953
I'm fine.

927
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:14,195
Come on, I got you, Ralph. Just breathe.

928
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:22,273
Just breathe. Just breathe, Ralph.
It's okay. It's okay.

929
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,431
Just breathe, Ralph, just breathe.

930
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,115
I got you, I got you. I got you. Come on.

931
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:34,917
Hey! Hey! Give him a shot
of morphine and move on.

932
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:37,560
He's not going to last a day.

933
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:40,997
Please. Please, Doss, no.
No. Don't leave me.

934
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,549
Don't leave me.
God, please don't leave me.

935
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,552
I've got kids!

936
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:48,678
Please. Please, don't.
Please, don't leave me.

937
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:51,753
I ain't going anywhere.
I'm going to get you home.

938
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,072
I got you, Ralph. Okay?
I'm going to get you home.

939
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,877
Here comes the morphine.
Here comes the morphine.

940
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,519
It's going to kick in real quick, Ralph.

941
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,592
We're going to get you shifted.

942
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:06,191
Stretcher! Stretcher!

943
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,671
- Get up. Keep moving, son.
- I can't, I'm wounded.

944
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:14,955
There's nothing wrong with you.

945
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,400
Shit! Hang on, kid.

946
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:24,109
Move. A sitting duck's a dead one.

947
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,917
Move. Go, go, go!

948
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,673
This guy's a priority.

949
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,719
We got him, we got him. Here.

950
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,878
A priority? You ever heard of triage?
He'll be dead before we get him down.

951
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,110
You don't know that!

952
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:44,115
Get him down. All right? Huh?

953
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,999
- Okay. Okay. Go.
- Okay. Okay.

954
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:49,997
It's all right, buddy.
We're going to get you home.

955
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:58,630
Medic! Help! Help.

956
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:01,918
I figure if we can't see them,
then they can't see us neither.

957
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,430
Help!

958
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,953
I got you, Frank. Where you hit?

959
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:32,072
- I think they can see us, smart ass!
- Doss, come on, come on.

960
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,355
Give me a hand here.

961
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,713
Get down, sir.

962
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,951
Over there! The bunkers.

963
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,760
I see them. Better stay down, sir.

964
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,316
- I got 'em, dead ahead.
- Yeah, I see 'em, too.

965
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,596
Push in as close as you can.
Give them everything you've got.

966
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,717
I'll send in the
weapons team to flank them.

967
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,952
You keep that tight, you're going to be
right as rain. All right?

968
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,793
I got him, Doss. I got him.

969
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,951
Here you go, come on now.
Come sit over here.

970
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,076
Hey.

971
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,109
You doing okay?

972
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,270
Okay.

973
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,914
And, fire!

974
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:42,670
Down!

975
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,519
Son of a bitch.

976
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,672
- You, get on it.
- Yes, sir!

977
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:55,878
Take 'em. Go. Fire!

978
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:03,880
Cover!

979
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:14,553
Go, go. Go, Ghoul.
Get in the hole. Stay there.

980
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:21,909
Go! Go, Smitty, we'll cover you. Leapfrog.

981
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,189
Cover.

982
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,593
Satchel!

983
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,752
- Ghoul!
- Clear.

984
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:51,070
Come on, stick it. Stick it, Ghoul.

985
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,158
Cover! Cover!

986
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,673
Son of a bitch.

987
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,159
Cover his ass.

988
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,160
Medic! Medic! Help me.

989
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:54,550
Go!

990
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,349
Medic!

991
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,357
I'm here. Put your hand on it.
Put your hand on it!

992
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:19,356
Go, go, go!

993
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,751
Ghoul. Ghoul.

994
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,158
You're okay. Where you hit?

995
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,712
You got a bump on the head, that's okay.

996
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,755
What's your name?

997
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,315
- Andy.
- Andy what?

998
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:52,480
Andy Walker.

999
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,358
Also known as?

1000
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:56,750
Ghoul.

1001
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,638
Ghoul. Ghoul, you're okay, you're okay.

1002
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,956
Good job, men. Good work.

1003
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,555
Dig in for the night. We hold this spot,

1004
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:11,200
we mop up the rest of the ridge tomorrow.

1005
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:16,477
Okay, boys. Find yourself a nice
safe hole in or near the bunker.

1006
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,472
Rotate watch every two hours.

1007
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,632
We don't know what's out there.
Heads down, asses lower.

1008
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,518
And shoot anything
that don't speak English.

1009
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,320
- Does that include Grease, Sarge?
- Particularly him.

1010
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,676
I don't care if you need to
take a piss or a dump,

1011
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,752
it ain't safe to go out there alone.

1012
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,354
Over here, now!

1013
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:33,954
Where the hell are you going, Doss?

1014
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,631
Still more wounded out there, Sarge.

1015
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:39,359
I'll go with him.

1016
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,477
Be smart. Keep your ears down.

1017
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,079
All right, let's find a spot.

1018
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:57,111
Rinnelli and Henry dead in
the first 15 minutes, just straight off.

1019
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,551
Straight off.

1020
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:04,839
Peterson, Popeye. Standford and Murphy.

1021
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,000
Page and Unger.

1022
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,358
Ralston.

1023
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:18,279
"In peace, sons bury their fathers,
in war, fathers bury their sons."

1024
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:23,199
You wanna stop spouting that crap, huh?

1025
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:27,194
It don't help none.

1026
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:31,797
Yeah, you got that right. Not here.

1027
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:37,159
Hey, give me that.

1028
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,874
Hey, we've got an abdominal wound.

1029
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:49,156
This man is going to need some plasma.

1030
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,594
- You got it.
- Leave him with us.

1031
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:52,797
Okay. You're okay now. They got you.

1032
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,594
Should we find a hole and dig in?

1033
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,550
Sounds good to me.

1034
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:08,429
Put your helmet on.

1035
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,880
You ain't going to eat them?

1036
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,870
I don't eat meat. Help yourself.

1037
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:27,670
Of course you don't.

1038
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:38,195
That's one heck of a dame.

1039
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:43,753
You know you're fighting out of your
weight class with her, don't you?

1040
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,599
Yes, I do.

1041
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,879
Don't tell her that.

1042
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,917
She'd be much happier
with a man like me anyway.

1043
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,957
Yeah, until she got to know you.

1044
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,638
I'm an asshole sometimes.

1045
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:05,316
Sometimes?

1046
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,712
Yeah, all right. All right.

1047
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,354
These Japs are sneaky.

1048
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:42,835
I'll take first watch, all right?
You get some shut-eye.

1049
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:29,870
Hell of a dream.

1050
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:52,000
Dreamed I got myself skewered.
I couldn't do nothing.

1051
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:54,790
Rifle's just there.

1052
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:01,109
It won't bite.

1053
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,995
Yeah, it will.

1054
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,480
Look around you.

1055
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:09,836
After what we've just been through,

1056
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,957
any sane man would be
screaming for a weapon.

1057
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:13,952
I never claimed to be sane.

1058
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,673
My daddy's a drunk.

1059
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:27,039
He fought it for years,
but it kind of got a hold of him hard.

1060
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,270
Made him mean.

1061
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:29,635
Least you knew him.

1062
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:32,952
Mine could have been any one of 10 guys,
and none of them worth a damn, so...

1063
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,399
So, your momma raised you?

1064
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,552
I knew her, but she gave me
to an orphanage when I was five.

1065
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:40,915
Never saw her again.

1066
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:44,833
I learned how to hate quick.

1067
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:49,870
I learned how to judge people quicker,
and I got you very wrong.

1068
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:02,153
My daddy used to beat me and my brother
just because the sun rose,

1069
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:04,357
and then whip us just because it set.

1070
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,320
I could take that...

1071
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,916
...but when he would do it to our momma...

1072
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,151
Get away from me, woman!

1073
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,798
That's enough. No more. Do you hear me?

1074
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:27,712
Pull the damn trigger.

1075
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:32,352
Stop it! Stop!

1076
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,715
But you didn't kill him?

1077
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,318
In my heart, I did.

1078
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,712
So that's why I made my promise to God,

1079
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,871
I ain't never going to touch a gun again.

1080
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:16,075
Well, I ain't giving you mine,
'cause you're crazy.

1081
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:39,435
Son of a...

1082
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:44,355
Son of a bitch.

1083
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:23,318
Move, move! Get your asses over here.

1084
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:24,720
Let's go!

1085
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:46,597
Fall back, fall back! Go!

1086
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,717
They're coming from underground.

1087
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,675
Searchlight, this is Baker Six.
Request immediate support.

1088
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:09,639
Target is Yoke-Tare-Five-One-Five.

1089
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:11,677
Yes! Yes, I know
that's where the hell we are,

1090
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,274
but I don't expect to be here much longer!

1091
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:16,713
I called an artillery strike.

1092
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,474
Fall back. Move. Move!

1093
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:28,111
Fall back! Incoming!

1094
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:57,796
Hey, buddy. I'm right here. Right here.

1095
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:06,590
Okay.

1096
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:08,875
Cover me.

1097
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:12,910
Go, go!

1098
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,352
Get out of here, kid!

1099
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:31,389
Come here, son.

1100
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,435
You know what to do. Keep pressure on it.

1101
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:43,710
No! Don't need plasma. Give it to him.

1102
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:47,999
Over there. I'll be okay. Go. Go.

1103
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,753
- Grease! Get Irv's back.
- What?

1104
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,832
- You got it, okay.
- See you soon.

1105
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:59,474
Come on. Come on.

1106
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:05,839
We gotta move right now. Come on, come on.

1107
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:32,113
Go! Go! Go!

1108
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:40,595
Change!

1109
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:47,919
There's too many,
get the hell out of here!

1110
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,719
Move! Move!

1111
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:36,833
- I'm scared. I'm scared.
- It's going to help the pain.

1112
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:42,952
No, don't. Don't you do that. Come on.

1113
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,680
Come on, Smitty, you stay with me.
Let's go. We gotta move.

1114
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,475
- Hey!
- Yeah.

1115
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:09,960
Help me get him down.
Help me get him down.

1116
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:11,520
Yeah.

1117
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,034
Come on, let's move. Come on.

1118
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:15,077
Can't help him, buddy, he's gone.

1119
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:17,470
- No.
- Come on! We gotta get outta here!

1120
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:18,875
Let's go!

1121
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:21,920
Come on, let's go.

1122
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:32,793
Come on. Everyone.

1123
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,280
Off the ridge!

1124
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,437
What is it you want of me?

1125
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:24,114
I don't understand.

1126
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:32,079
I can't hear you.

1127
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:35,836
Medic, help me! Help me!

1128
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:37,639
Help me!

1129
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:44,113
Help me, Lord.

1130
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:45,759
All right.

1131
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:07,238
You're in good hands. Easy does it. Easy.

1132
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:09,118
...six... eight...

1133
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:11,960
Fourteen.

1134
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:13,599
Get these men secured immediately.

1135
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:14,830
Yes, sir.

1136
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:19,551
- Private Ford, how many?
- Thirty-two only came down, sir.

1137
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:21,194
- Good Lord.
- Let's go!

1138
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:24,997
- Let's load 'em up.
- Yes, sir.

1139
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:06,389
Harry. It's Desmond.

1140
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:10,036
We going to fix you up.
You just got to keep breathing. Okay?

1141
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:14,074
- Colonel wants to see you, sir.
- I need your jeep.

1142
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:16,675
You two stay here, keep watch,
keep your eyes peeled for Japs.

1143
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:18,319
- No, but...
- Stay here! Keep watch.

1144
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:19,675
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1145
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:31,479
Help. Help me.

1146
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:34,917
Watch out. I got you.

1147
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,591
Put your hand on it. Keep pressure on it.

1148
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:44,189
- I'm comin' back. Okay?
- Okay.

1149
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:01,873
Easy, fellas, easy.

1150
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:03,235
Here we go.

1151
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:10,559
Okay, guys, let's go.
On the count of three. One, two, three.

1152
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:14,991
Help, medic over here!

1153
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,320
It's okay, buddy, hold it together.

1154
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,032
We're at the edge, Eric.

1155
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:25,919
You just sit tight, okay?

1156
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:47,880
You're okay, Eric. You're okay, buddy.

1157
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:54,991
Son of a gun, this is going to work.

1158
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:57,037
One for each leg, Eric.

1159
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:00,113
We're going to get you dressed up
in a jiffy and get you down.

1160
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:01,953
I got you.

1161
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,358
I got you now, Eric.

1162
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:08,353
You have to trust me now, Eric.
You're gonna have to trust me.

1163
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:38,275
Japs!

1164
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:41,512
Hold on, one of ours.
Hold on! Let's go, let's go!

1165
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:46,598
I got you. I got you. I got you.

1166
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:50,430
Come on, I got you.
You're okay. You're okay.

1167
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:57,310
Hank, another one.

1168
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:05,036
Colonel, call off the artillery
attack on Hacksaw.

1169
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:08,511
Couldn't call it in. There's still
over 100 men left up there.

1170
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:10,910
Tell them to call off
the artillery on Hacksaw.

1171
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:15,349
Sit down, Jack. I'll get you a drink.

1172
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:28,439
We just lost our cover.

1173
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,276
They're stirrin', we got to move. Come on.

1174
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:43,150
About time.
They just keep coming by the...

1175
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,880
- OK, OK. Pick it up.
- I got this.

1176
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:25,514
Doss. Doss.

1177
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:29,958
Help. Help me.

1178
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:45,354
You're gonna have to trust me.
Take a breath.

1179
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:46,953
Let's go, buddy. Let's go.

1180
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:52,040
Jack, you don't know
if your men up there are dead or alive.

1181
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:54,396
You can't go back up there
without reinforcements.

1182
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:55,516
You'll end up killing the rest of them.

1183
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:56,590
Then give me the reinforcements.

1184
01:45:56,680 --> 01:46:00,435
I don't have any fresh men, okay?
I don't have any troops.

1185
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:02,591
Three battalions got wiped out today.

1186
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:05,354
It'll take more than a day
to get men in here.

1187
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,079
I need them faster than that.

1188
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:01,719
It's okay, it's okay.

1189
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:03,314
It's all right. It's all right.

1190
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:05,554
Everything's okay.

1191
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:24,399
Morphine. It's good.

1192
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,911
Shh.

1193
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:05,159
Pinnick, Pinnick. Pinnick. It's Doss.

1194
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:08,790
It's Doss. Be quiet. Be quiet. I got you.

1195
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:11,873
- Are you hit?
- Yeah. I can't see.

1196
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:14,270
Be quiet. Just be quiet.

1197
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:21,632
Hold still now. I got you. Hold tight.

1198
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:24,440
There you go. Try now. Try now.

1199
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:30,318
I thought I was blind!

1200
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:32,790
Shh... Keep it down. Can you walk?

1201
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:34,240
I don't know.

1202
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:36,198
We got to get out of here, okay? Come on.

1203
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:52,355
Good. Okay, we got you.

1204
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:53,709
We got you.

1205
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:09,233
Hey, Ted.

1206
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:12,677
It's me, it's Desmond.
I'm gonna fix you up.

1207
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:17,598
- You ready to get out of here?
- Sure am.

1208
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:36,439
Please, Lord, help me get one more.

1209
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:38,193
Help me get one more.

1210
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:08,759
Please, help me get one more.

1211
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:30,839
One more. Help me get one more.

1212
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:47,239
One more. Help me get one more.

1213
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:51,714
One more.

1214
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:54,834
Coming through.

1215
01:51:57,600 --> 01:51:59,353
Where the hell are these guys coming from?

1216
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:00,630
From Hacksaw.

1217
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:03,440
- I thought they pulled out.
- Not all of them.

1218
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:06,433
Some nut's up there
dragging wounded from the top.

1219
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:09,274
Even lowered a couple of Japs.

1220
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:12,478
They didn't make it.
Back with you directly.

1221
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:16,272
Easy, easy. All set, move out.

1222
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:49,997
Get in here. There's Nips everywhere.

1223
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:55,270
Son of a bitch. Private Corn Stalk.

1224
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:57,397
You are nothing if not full of surprises.

1225
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:59,312
You want some morphine?

1226
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:03,189
- Hell, yes. That or a bullet.
- Okay.

1227
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:05,511
There. There you go.

1228
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:12,551
All right, let me see. Let me see.

1229
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:15,514
How's this doing? Okay, not bad.

1230
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:19,277
Let me see.

1231
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,874
It looks much worse than it is.

1232
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:22,713
Girls will still want to kiss you.

1233
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:27,598
Sarge, you okay here for a while?

1234
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:29,876
Yeah, fine. Get out of here.

1235
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:31,599
I'm coming back.

1236
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:33,797
You ready? Let's go. You and me, come on.

1237
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:11,155
Captain. There's something you gotta see.

1238
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:16,236
Our guys have been
coming down in droves all night.

1239
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:18,676
And Hollywood's here.
I never thought I'd see that guy again.

1240
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:20,399
Come on, follow me. He's right here.

1241
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:26,357
What the hell is this?

1242
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:27,920
How you doing, sir?

1243
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,354
Hey, Cap.

1244
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:30,590
Captain.

1245
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,959
- It's good to see you, kid.
- Captain Glover, sir.

1246
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:37,394
How'd you get down, son?

1247
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:40,473
Doss. Howell's still up there.

1248
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:43,035
What, Howell and Doss did this?

1249
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:45,157
Mostly just Doss.

1250
01:54:45,240 --> 01:54:47,038
- Just Doss?
- Just Doss.

1251
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:49,589
Yeah, Doss, the coward.

1252
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:08,912
- You're like gum on a shoe, ain't you?
- Give me this.

1253
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,390
It's a bit late for target
practice now, don't you think?

1254
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:17,597
- Jump on it.
- You're kidding.

1255
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:19,478
No, I'm going to drag you.

1256
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:25,590
Let's do it.

1257
01:56:28,280 --> 01:56:29,509
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1258
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:30,590
Let's go.

1259
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:36,960
We got company.

1260
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:38,599
Come on.

1261
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:00,554
Arms up.

1262
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:03,479
You gotta be kidding me, Corn Stalk.

1263
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:05,392
"You're tying a bowline, boy,
not building a bra."

1264
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:08,433
Come on.

1265
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:12,315
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

1266
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:13,675
Get on.

1267
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:42,676
- Put me down!
- Yes, Sarge.

1268
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:45,320
- Sergeant Howell.
- Doss is still up there.

1269
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,310
- What the hell?
- He's got Japs on his tail.

1270
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:22,549
We got him.

1271
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:24,438
That's good. That's good.

1272
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:26,512
It's okay, we got him.

1273
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:33,033
Whoa, whoa...

1274
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:35,919
- It's okay, Doss.
- Come on, Doss, come on.

1275
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,674
- You're safe.
- Come on, Doss.

1276
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:57,435
Desmond, it's all right, it's all right.

1277
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:00,200
Desmond.

1278
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:05,273
Easy, easy. Here, come on.

1279
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:12,680
Are you wounded?

1280
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:15,672
Mmm...

1281
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:19,078
No. No.

1282
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:24,280
Let's get this soldier
to a hospital tent, right now.

1283
01:59:24,360 --> 01:59:26,829
- Come on, easy now.
- Easy, easy.

1284
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:28,149
Make some space.

1285
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:13,955
We need someone
to come and clean up in here.

1286
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:17,514
Where's Irv?

1287
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:20,399
- Irv? You mean, Schecter the medic?
- Yeah.

1288
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:23,678
He didn't make it.
He died of shock. No plasma.

1289
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:26,556
Sorry.

1290
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:05,357
All I saw was a skinny kid.
I didn't know who you were.

1291
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:12,078
You've done more than
any other man could have done

1292
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:14,556
in the service of his country.

1293
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:17,155
And I have never been more wrong
about someone in my life.

1294
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:20,752
I hope one day you can forgive me.

1295
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:35,597
We have to go back up tomorrow.

1296
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:40,960
I realize that tomorrow is your Sabbath.

1297
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:49,550
Most of these men
don't believe the same way you do.

1298
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:55,793
But they believe so much
in how much you believe.

1299
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:01,839
And what you did on that ridge,
it's nothing short of a miracle,

1300
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:03,679
and they want a piece of it.

1301
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:08,671
And they're not going
to go up there without you.

1302
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,719
<i>What the hell is your delay, Captain?</i>

1303
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:23,553
<i>You were supposed to begin
that assault 10 minutes ago!</i>

1304
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:26,439
- We're waiting, sir.
- Waiting for what?

1305
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:31,914
For Private Doss
to finish praying for us, sir.

1306
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,639
<i>Private Doss is praying for you?</i>

1307
02:02:33,720 --> 02:02:35,518
<i>Who the hell is Private Doss?</i>

1308
02:02:57,280 --> 02:02:58,509
Let's go to work.

1309
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:54,312
Down. Get down!

1310
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:57,757
Get on the ground. On the ground. Now!

1311
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:39,357
Lay down, lay down. I got the morphine.

1312
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,912
Let's go, let's get these men out of here.

1313
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:52,674
My Bible... My Bible. My Bible...

1314
02:05:52,760 --> 02:05:55,514
Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Stop!

1315
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:58,115
My Bible, my Bible, my Bible.

1316
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:00,076
Okay.

1317
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:19,394
You're going home, Desmond.
We've taken Hacksaw.

1318
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:25,716
Hold up, hold up! Desmond!

1319
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:28,990
Desmond.

1320
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:19,038
<i>I was praying the whole time.</i>

1321
02:09:19,120 --> 02:09:24,354
I just kept praying,
"Lord, please help me get one more."

1322
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:29,560
When I got this, I said,
"Lord, please help me get one more."

1323
02:09:35,640 --> 02:09:38,075
<i>I would say anyone is wrong</i>

1324
02:09:38,160 --> 02:09:40,117
<i>to try to compromise
somebody's conviction.</i>

1325
02:09:40,200 --> 02:09:43,318
I don't care whether
it's army or what it is.

1326
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:47,792
When you own a conviction,
that is not a joke.

1327
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:50,839
That's what you are.

1328
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:54,551
<i>Even though I said those things to him</i>

1329
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:55,909
<i>in regard to carrying a rifle,</i>

1330
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:02,600
then he would never be by my
damn side at all unless he had a rifle.

1331
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:05,559
<i>But then, in the long run,</i>

1332
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:10,351
<i>finding out that he was one
of the bravest persons alive.</i>

1333
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:13,194
And then to have him end up saving my life

1334
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:16,432
was the irony of the whole thing.

1335
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:21,595
Blood had run down
into the fella's face and eyes.

1336
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:25,720
He was laying there just
groaning and calling for a medic.

1337
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:34,072
I took water from my canteen,
got some bandage, and I washed his face.

1338
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:38,996
And when I... was washing his eyes,
his eyes came open.

1339
02:10:39,080 --> 02:10:42,756
Man, he just lit up.

1340
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:47,794
He says, "I thought I was blind."

1341
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:50,952
And if I hadn't got anything
more out of the war

1342
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:55,876
than that smile he gave me,
I'd have been well repaid.

1342
02:10:56,305 --> 02:11:56,338
