1
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:14,006
<i>Mr. Seinfeld,
you have a show tonight, don't ya?</i>

2
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,765
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

3
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:19,019
<i>They're telling me there's
too much traffic to land right now.</i>

4
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,705
- Oh.
- What do you want me to do?

5
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,648
No problem.
You can let me out anywhere along here.

6
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,475
Thank you!

7
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,895
Thank you very much!

8
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,897
Oh, my God.

9
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,027
What a moment.

10
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,612
What a feeling.

11
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,448
What an accomplishment this is...

12
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,115
on your part.

13
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,787
What you just went through...

14
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,290
going out, dealing with...

15
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,293
natural obstacles of life.

16
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,005
Difficult people, arranging, planning.

17
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,842
Annoying friends, many of whom
you're sitting with right now...

18
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,138
...who, for some reason,

19
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,225
required
unnecessarily complicated back-and-forth,

20
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,727
communicating about "Who's going?"

21
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,188
"When do we leave?"
and "How do we get there?"

22
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:48,066
"Why don't you pick me up?"
"Why don't I pick <i>you </i>up?"

23
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,069
"It's on the way."
"It's the opposite direction."

24
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,277
"My car." "Your car."

25
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,946
"One car." "Two cars."

26
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,866
"When are we gonna eat? Did you eat?
I didn't eat."

27
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,619
"Are you gonna eat? I'm starving."
"I'm stuffed."

28
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:03,039
"I've been eating Jolly Ranchers all day.
I need something solid."

29
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,959
"What about the tickets?
Who's got the tickets?

30
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,418
Do you have the tickets?"

31
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,231
How many times
did you hear the word "tickets" today?

32
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,631
"Don't forget the tickets."

33
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,717
"You have the tickets?"
"Yeah, I got the tickets!"

34
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,220
"Did you get their tickets?"
"I didn't get tickets for them.

35
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,180
They gotta get their own tickets!

36
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,225
They didn't pay me
from the last time I got 'em tickets."

37
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,271
Why are your friends so annoying?

38
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,692
The people
you have chosen to be with in life.

39
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,318
It makes no sense.

40
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,696
You'd get rid of all of 'em in a second...

41
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,615
if it wasn't
even a bigger pain in the ass

42
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,870
to find new people,
learn about their annoying problems

43
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,913
that they never do anything about...

44
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,420
...change the names and numbers
in your phone,

45
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,088
delete the old contacts.

46
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,883
"Ah, the hell with it.
I'll ride it out with these idiots.

47
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,178
It's the same meals, holidays,
and movies anyway.

48
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,013
What's the difference who I'm with?"

49
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,557
"Just wanna be out." This is out.

50
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,101
People talk about goin' out.

51
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,896
"We should go out. Let's go out.
We never go out."

52
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,564
Well...

53
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,316
this is it.

54
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:25,121
Now, the good thing about being out
is you don't have to be out for long.

55
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,791
Just long enough to get the next feeling,
which you're all gonna get.

56
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,669
And that feeling is,
"I gotta be gettin' back."

57
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,756
After all the work

58
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:38,218
you put into getting your ass
where it is right now...

59
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,180
you're only halfway through this nightmare
at this point.

60
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,018
Wherever you are, really,
anywhere in life, at some point,

61
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,687
you gotta get the hell outta there.

62
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,689
You're at work; you wanna get home.

63
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,651
You're at home.
"I'm working all week. I gotta get out."

64
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,237
You're out, and it's late.
"I gotta get back."

65
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,822
"I gotta get up."
"I gotta get to the airport."

66
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,158
"When are we getting on the plane?"
Plane takes off.

67
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,077
"When's the plane gonna land?"
Plane lands.

68
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,080
"Why don't they open the door
so we can get out?"

69
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,164
Nobody wants to be anywhere.

70
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,506
Nobody likes anything.

71
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,343
We're cranky, we're irritable,

72
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,888
and we're dealing with it
by constantly changing locations.

73
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:31,479
And so... we come up with things
like this, what we're doing right now.

74
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:35,858
This is a made-up, bogus, hyped-up,
not-necessary special event.

75
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,112
That's what this is.

76
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:46,160
That a lot of people
worked very hard to put together

77
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,997
so that we could all just kill some time.

78
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,793
That's why I'm here.
I had nothing to do either, by the way.

79
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,714
I can tell you that. You know me.
You and I...

80
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:01,509
Come on, you and I know each other
on a certain level...

81
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,511
electronic, though it may be...

82
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,389
for many, many years, at this point.

83
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,808
We're going through life together.
A beautiful thing.

84
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:09,976
You know what I've done.

85
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,978
You know what I've made.
You know how I live.

86
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,688
You know for a fact...

87
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,317
I could be anywhere
in the world right now!

88
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,194
Now, you be honest.

89
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,529
If you were me,

90
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,949
would you be up here,
hacking out another one of these?

91
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,209
Maybe... or maybe not.

92
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,795
Nonetheless, I am thrilled to be here.

93
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,630
I love it here.

94
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:45,094
This could be my favorite spot
in the entire world,

95
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,096
right here, right now. Could be.

96
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,353
- We love you!
- Thank you, sweetheart. I love you too.

97
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,690
This is, in fact,
my favorite type of intimate relationship.

98
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:03,529
I love you, you love me,
and we will never meet.

99
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,117
Yeah, Jerry!

100
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,038
It's all things we do
to convince ourselves

101
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,247
our lives don't suck.

102
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,250
That's another thing this is.
You'll be going tomorrow,

103
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,355
"My life doesn't suck. I saw a comedian
who had a show in the '90s last night

104
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,756
at the Beacon Theatre on Broadway,
in New York City."

105
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,801
Even though your life
does pretty much suck.

106
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,888
And I know that
because I know that everyone's life sucks.

107
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,848
Your life sucks. My life sucks, too.

108
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,644
Perhaps not quite as much.

109
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:40,691
But still, in the vast suckness...

110
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:45,113
of human life, everyone's life sucks.
It's okay.

111
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,532
Never feel bad that your life sucks.

112
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,367
The greatest lesson you can learn in life:

113
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,578
"Sucks" and "great" are pretty close.

114
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,288
They're not that different.

115
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,998
We live here in New York.

116
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,352
Over here, I'm so sick of hearing about
great restaurants.

117
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,796
"Jerry, we went to a great restaurant
last night.

118
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,840
It was great. You would love it.

119
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,801
He would love it. Wouldn't he love it?
You would love it."

120
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,929
"You."
You know how your friends single you out?

121
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,472
<i>"You. </i>Wouldn't he?

122
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,350
<i>He </i>would love that place."

123
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,311
"Did you like it?"
"I didn't care for it myself, but <i>you..."</i>

124
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,358
I don't like the great restaurants.
I don't like great anything.

125
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,762
I'm looking for not bad.
"How's that food?" "It's not bad."

126
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,339
"That sounds great. Let's go over there
and get this over with."

127
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,110
"Wanna hear the specials?"
"No. If they're so special,

128
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,162
put 'em on the menu.

129
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,498
I'm not interested in food
that's auditioning to get on the team."

130
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,626
I don't know
what the hell you're talkin' about.

131
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,171
"We're gonna pan-sear it.
We're gonna herb-crust it.

132
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:47,008
We're gonna drizzle it with something
that's a reduction of somethin' else."

133
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,970
Stop drizzling.
We can't take the drizzling anymore!

134
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,931
It's too much drizzling!

135
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,519
Maybe if you didn't reduce it so much,
you wouldn't have to drizzle it!

136
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,565
The meal takes two and a half hours.

137
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,552
Your ass is hurtin' by the end of it.
It's not half as good

138
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,862
as a bowl of Lucky Charms
and Pepsi anyway.

139
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:14,160
Check always comes in that book,
the little story of the bill.

140
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,204
Yeah, here's the story.

141
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,706
Once upon a time, you got rib.
That's the story.

142
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,126
You're on the street afterwards
with your friends,

143
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,888
"I-I didn't think that was...
Was that great?" Everyone says "great."

144
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,362
"Yeah, I didn't think it was that great.
What did you think?"

145
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,926
"It sucked, right? That place sucks."

146
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,137
A lot of great places just suck!

147
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,140
Then you go to a baseball game.
You have a hot dog.

148
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,142
The hot dog is cold.

149
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,102
The bun is not toasted.

150
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,606
The vendor is an ex-con
in a work-release program.

151
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,443
You love that hot dog every time.

152
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,320
Does it... Does it suck? Yes.

153
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,988
Is it great? Yes.

154
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,115
That's how close they are!

155
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,210
"Sucks" and "great"
are the only two ratings

156
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,004
people even give to anything anymore.

157
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,257
"Hey, let's go see that new movie.
I heard it's great."

158
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,800
"Really? I heard it sucked."

159
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,011
"How could it suck?
It's supposed to be great."

160
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,473
"I heard the beginning is great,
and then after that, it sucks."

161
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,810
"Oh, that sucks."
"I know. It coulda been great."

162
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,063
I say that "sucks" and "great"
are the exact same thing.

163
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,186
You have an ice cream cone.
Walking down the street,

164
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,401
the ice cream falls off
the top of the cone,

165
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,069
hits the pavement. Sucks.

166
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,654
What do you say? "Great."

167
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,459
Food's a good subject.
Let's talk a little bit more about this.

168
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,170
'Cause we were
in Vegas a couple months ago.

169
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,965
And everybody goes,
"Jerry, you gotta go to the buffet.

170
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,174
They got the buffet.

171
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,344
Oh, come on. You can get whatever you want
at the buffet."

172
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,473
What is the idea of the buffet?

173
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,392
"Well, things are bad.

174
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,561
How could we make it worse?

175
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,480
Why don't we put people

176
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,275
that are already struggling
with portion control...

177
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:17,325
...into some kind of debauched,
Caligula food orgy

178
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,452
of unlimited human consumption?

179
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,542
Let's make the entrance
a chocolate-syrup water park slide."

180
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,673
The buffet is like taking your dog
to Petco

181
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,675
and letting your dog do the shopping.

182
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,846
You give him your wallet
in the parking lot and go,

183
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,515
"Why don't you go in,
get whatever you think...

184
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,644
is the right amount of dog food for you?

185
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,981
Use your dog judgment.

186
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,317
I'm gonna wait in the car.

187
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,903
Leave the window open a crack
so I can breathe."

188
00:10:55,738 --> 00:11:00,868
People do not do well
in an unsupervised eating environment.

189
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:06,165
Nobody would walk into a restaurant
and say, "I'll have a yogurt parfait,

190
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,418
sparerib, meat pie, crab leg,
four cookies, and an egg-white omelet."

191
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,716
People are building
death-row last meal wish lists

192
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,051
on these plates.

193
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:22,306
It's like a perfect working model
of all their emotional problems

194
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,141
and personal difficulties.

195
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,352
They just walk around.
They just kinda hold it out.

196
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,104
"This is what I'm dealing with.

197
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,316
It's a salad
with a scoop of ice cream on it.

198
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,985
I've got some unresolved issues

199
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,405
I'm trying to work out
here at the buffet."

200
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,908
Start accosting strangers.

201
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,845
"Excuse me. Where did you get that?
What is that? I didn't even see that.

202
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,205
What is that?
Is that a caramelized chicken leg?

203
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,517
I gotta try that. Give me yours.
You know where they are.

204
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,042
You can get more. Come on!"

205
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,673
Let's...

206
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,758
Please. Please.

207
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,344
Please stay with the group
as much as you can.

208
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,889
We're gonna be going
through a lot of exhibits.

209
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,813
I don't want any stragglers.

210
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,521
But when I was a kid,

211
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,649
the biggest food thing
that happened to me...

212
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,359
When they invented the Pop-Tart,

213
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,195
the back of my head blew right off.

214
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,283
We couldn't comprehend the Pop-Tart!

215
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,660
It was too advanced!

216
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,373
We saw it in the supermarket.
It was like an alien spaceship.

217
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:33,043
We were just chimps in the dirt,
playing with sticks. Just...

218
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,131
...grunting, pointing.

219
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,175
"Pop-Tart is here."

220
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,680
Think back to when the Pop-Tart came out.
It was the '60s.

221
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,390
We had toast!

222
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,729
We had orange juice,
frozen decades in advance.

223
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,273
You had to hack away at it
with a knife!

224
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,735
It was like a murder

225
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,529
to get a couple of drops of liquidity
in the morning.

226
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,990
We had shredded wheat.

227
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,367
It was like wrapping your lips
around a woodchipper.

228
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,119
You'd have breakfast,

229
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,708
you had to take two days off
for the scars to heal so you could speak.

230
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,919
My mom made Cream of Wheat.
She didn't get the recipe.

231
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,380
"Mom, the amount of water
in this dish is critical.

232
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,093
You're making it too thick!

233
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,973
I can't even move my little-kid spoon
in the bowl!

234
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:33,771
I'm seven. I feel like I'm rowing
in the hull of a Greek slave ship.

235
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,197
That was breakfast?"

236
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,951
And in the midst of that dark
and hopeless moment,

237
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,996
the Kellogg's Pop-Tarts suddenly appeared
out of Battle Creek, Michigan,

238
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,832
which, as you cereal fans know,

239
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,000
is the corporate headquarters
of Kellogg's

240
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,253
and a town
I have always wanted to visit...

241
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,756
because it seems
like a cereal Silicon Valley...

242
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,676
of breakfast super scientists...

243
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,929
conceiving of the frosted,
fruit-filled, heatable rectangles

244
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,223
in the same shape
as the box it comes in...

245
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,893
and with the same nutrition
as the box it comes in, too.

246
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,604
That was the hard part.

247
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:19,483
I don't know how long it took to invent,
but they must've come out of that lab

248
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,902
like Moses with the two tablets
of the Ten Commandments.

249
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,412
"The Pop-Tart is here!

250
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,748
Two in the packet!

251
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,420
Two slots in a toaster!

252
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,799
Let's see ya screw this up!

253
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,596
Why two?
One's not enough. Three's too many.

254
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,558
And they can't go stale,
'cause they weren't ever fresh."

255
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,003
What else is annoying
in the world, besides everything?

256
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,863
What about your device dictatorship

257
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:09,408
that you live under,
cowering in fear from your phone?

258
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,761
"My phone! Where's my phone?
I can't find my phone. It's...

259
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,538
Oh, here it is. I got it. It's here.
It's here. My phone is here."

260
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,499
I didn't... I moved it from this pocket
to this pocket.

261
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,545
I didn't know where it was for a second.
I'm okay. That was really close.

262
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,213
Phew.

263
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:27,968
You are so hypno-phonified at this point,
you hand your phone to somebody

264
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,386
to show them something.

265
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,804
After two seconds, you go,

266
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,849
"All right. Okay, give me it back.
Give it back.

267
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,310
You saw it. That... that's it.
Give it back.

268
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,188
I am completely off-the-grid right now."

269
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,025
When that battery gets low...

270
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,737
you feel like your whole body's
runnin' out of power, don't you? I just...

271
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,532
I-I feel tired when the phone battery
gets down to ten or five.

272
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,659
I can't even walk.

273
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,788
"You guys go ahead without me.
I gotta get to a charger."

274
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,000
A call comes in. "Listen,

275
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,461
I don't know how much time
I have left out here.

276
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,674
I wish I could take back
some of the things I've said.

277
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,468
If I go dead on the street,

278
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,554
tell everyone I know
I'll talk to them tomorrow."

279
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,900
"Well, I gotta stay in touch with people,
Jerry.

280
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,986
That's why the phone's so important to me.

281
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,279
People are pretty important, you know."

282
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,382
Really? They don't seem very important,

283
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,867
the way you scroll through their names
on your contact list

284
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,536
like a gay French king.

285
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,918
"Who pleases me today?

286
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,423
Who shall I favor?

287
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,591
Who shall I delete?"

288
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,016
We are not separating from the phone.

289
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,976
It's a part of us.

290
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,603
Now, who are you with no phone?

291
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,189
What access to information do you have?

292
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,108
What you can remember.

293
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:13,365
What'll you do without your pictures?
Are you gonna describe what you saw?

294
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,662
That doesn't work for us.

295
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:23,000
We don't wanna talk to anybody
that doesn't have a phone.

296
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,127
That's why it's called an iPhone.

297
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,129
It's half myself, half phone.

298
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,881
<i>That's </i>a complete individual.

299
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,500
I don't even know
what the purpose of people is anymore.

300
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,232
I think the only reason people still exist

301
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,806
is phones need pockets to ride around in.

302
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,227
I used to think Uber was on my phone
so <i>I </i>could get around.

303
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,497
Then I started thinking
maybe they put Uber on the phone

304
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,001
because that makes me take the phone,

305
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,317
'cause the phone is using me
to get around.

306
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,488
Who's really the Uber
in this big prostitution ring?

307
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,699
I'm the little bitch carrying the phone.

308
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,078
The cars are the hos,

309
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,497
picking up strangers
off the street all night.

310
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,710
And the phone's the big pimp
of the whole thing,

311
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,935
telling the drivers,
"You just get who I tell ya to get.

312
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,211
I'll handle the money."

313
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,761
We call it a phone.
We don't even use it as a phone.

314
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,305
Nobody's talkin' on the phone.

315
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,891
Once they gave you the option,

316
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,851
you could talk or type,
talkin' ended that day.

317
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,645
It's over.

318
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,939
Talking is obsolete. It's antiquated.

319
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:30,567
I feel like a blacksmith
up here sometimes, to tell you the truth.

320
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,696
I could text you this whole thing.
We can get the hell outta here right now.

321
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,246
Why would I wanna get information
from a face when I could get it

322
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,206
from a nice, clean screen?

323
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,917
Don't you feel uncomfortable now?
Faces come up to you,

324
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,920
"Well, I'll tell you
what I think about what you ought to do."

325
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,965
Their lips and their teeth and their gums
and their...

326
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,802
There's a missed shaving spot,
there's a piece of crust, some goo.

327
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,221
You see a little lunch remnant
in their teeth.

328
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,348
"Just send me an e-mail about this,
would ya?

329
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,808
I can't do it anymore.

330
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,062
Your face is the worst news
I've had all day."

331
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,943
We wanna text, text, just text!

332
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,698
We like that word, don't we? "Text!"
It's fun to say. It's got that...

333
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,951
short, tight, got the <i>x </i>in there,
a little bite to it.

334
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,328
"Text it! Text!"

335
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,622
"Don't... I don't...
I don't know where it is.

336
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,709
Don't tell me! Text it. Don't tell me!"

337
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,422
Remember when we first got text?

338
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,884
Not really. Can't really remember that.

339
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,594
I-I can't either.

340
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,345
I mean, I know that we have it.

341
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,806
I know we didn't use to have it.

342
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,143
I don't know how we got it.
I don't remember...

343
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,354
Did they tell us we were getting it?
There was...

344
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,608
Was there an announcement
that we were getting it?

345
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,695
There was no commercial.
I don't remember a commercial.

346
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,574
"Want some human contact
but kind of had it up to here with people?

347
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,160
Try text.

348
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,995
Need to get someone
some information

349
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:08,040
but don't want to hear their stupid voice
responding to it?

350
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,251
You need to be on text."

351
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,796
We like it. It's fast. It's efficient.

352
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,132
Not fast enough,
apparently, for some people.

353
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,594
Now, instead of "OK,"
a lot of people text me just the "K,"

354
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:21,970
leavin' the "O" off.

355
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:26,058
What... what microfraction of a second
did you save?

356
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,560
You think you're efficient?

357
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,686
What does that add up to,

358
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,730
like two free minutes
at the end of your day

359
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,941
that you can watch
a YouTube video of skateboarders

360
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,734
banging their nuts off a railing?

361
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:41,531
Somebody texted me "TY" the other day
instead of "thank you."

362
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,992
I'd like to bang your nuts off a railing,
TY.

363
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,870
That's not a thank-you.

364
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,957
We're so anxious to get the next text,

365
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,760
they give you
those three little ghosty dots

366
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,792
to tell ya it's coming.

367
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,837
"Oh, we're cooking up a good one for you.
Wait till ya see this.

368
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,967
You are not gonna believe
what this guy's about to say."

369
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,387
I can't show it to you yet.

370
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,931
We're still working on it
in the text machine,

371
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,683
but it's gonna be a beauty.

372
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,559
You can see the pistons pumping.

373
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,274
Sometimes, we get the ghosty dots,
and then no text.

374
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,483
What happened there?

375
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,487
I wanna know what that was.

376
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,031
Is that like somebody coming up to you
and going...

377
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,408
"Ah, uh, never mind."

378
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,130
The phones keep getting smarter.

379
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,506
Why don't we?

380
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,679
Why are people on voice mail
still telling me to wait for the beep?

381
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,473
It's the 21st goddamn century.

382
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,601
I think we're all up to speed
on the beep.

383
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:56,898
The Maasai tribesmen of the African plain
know about the beep.

384
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,860
They don't leave a message
till they hear: "Ma-ma-lay, ma-ma-lay.

385
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,945
Beep!"

386
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:07,617
Why are people still telling me
to leave my name and number on voice mail?

387
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,120
Are these necessary instructions
for anyone?

388
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,749
Anyone getting messages like,
"This is a woman. Goodbye"?

389
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,884
Or: "He's dead. Call me back."
"Who was that?"

390
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,975
What about the, uh, camera in the phone?

391
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,895
I always wonder if they...
Before they do those kinds of things,

392
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,104
do they stand around and go,

393
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,607
"Hey, are you sure this is a good idea?

394
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,984
You don't think this one feature,

395
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,195
all by itself,
could result in so many pictures,

396
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,405
videos, posting, comments, and clapbacks

397
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,575
that the entire life force
of the human race just drains out

398
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,036
like a puddle of piss
by the side of the road?

399
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,087
You don't think that could happen
from this one thing?"

400
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:01,837
"No.

401
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:06,176
Nor do I think every restaurant dinner
will end with a picture bully going,

402
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,095
'Okay, everyone. Picture.

403
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:09,888
Come on.

404
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,849
We gotta have a picture.'"

405
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,603
"Why? We didn't have a good time.
I don't wanna remember this."

406
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,941
And let's make sure we get
the least phone-fluent person

407
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,818
in the area to take the picture.

408
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:26,488
Someone old, nervous, clumsy,
confused, or dim-witted.

409
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,909
Someone that can't hold things,
see things, aim things, press things.

410
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,829
Someone who,
the second they're handed the phone,

411
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,790
it slips off camera mode,
and they can't get it back.

412
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,419
"I don't know. Is anyone...

413
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,003
I don't, uh...

414
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,797
Does anyone know how to..."

415
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,259
Let's get that person
so we can be standing here even longer

416
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,678
with fake, frozen smiles
and our arm around somebody

417
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,347
you would never touch
in any other social situation.

418
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,767
We're picture-addicted.

419
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,147
There's no way to stop it. Sometimes,
I wanna go back to the flip phone.

420
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,316
One of those ones I see on TV.
They have these phones for old people

421
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,652
with the...
with the giant buttons like floor tiles.

422
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,713
You ever see that commercial?

423
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:11,199
These old people phones,
two buttons: your kid, ambulance.

424
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,199
That's it.

425
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,997
Forget the numbers.
You don't need the numbers.

426
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,879
Why don't we update
some of these terms that we use

427
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,755
in the tech world, like "e-mail"?

428
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,134
Why is the world "mail" even in "e-mail"?

429
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,094
Is there any similarity between e-mail

430
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:34,139
and whatever the hell is going on
in the Postal Service?

431
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,143
One of them operates on a digital,
fiber-optic, hyper-speed network.

432
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,020
The other is this dazed and confused,

433
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,856
distant branch of the Cub Scouts
out there, just...

434
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,111
...bumbling around the streets
in embarrassing shorts

435
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:51,406
and jackets with meaningless patches
and victory medals.

436
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,497
Driving four miles an hour,
20 feet at a time,

437
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,208
on the wrong side
of a mentally handicapped Jeep.

438
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,002
They always have this emotional,

439
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,588
financial meltdown
every three and half years

440
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:10,592
that their business model from 1630
isn't working anymore.

441
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,971
"How are we going to catch up?"

442
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:20,310
I cannot understand
how a 21st-century information system

443
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:23,230
based on licking, walking,

444
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,107
and a random number of pennies...

445
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,985
is struggling to compete.

446
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:35,116
They always push the postmaster general
out on TV to explain their difficulties.

447
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,410
He's all freaked out,
rings under his eyes,

448
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,371
no shave, pullin' all-nighters.

449
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,457
"We can't keep it up much longer.

450
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:47,254
Looks like we're gonna have to go up
another penny on the stamps!"

451
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,594
We're sittin' at home, "No, dude, relax.

452
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,013
We don't even know
how much a stamp is anyway.

453
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,811
Forty-eight, 53, 61... Make it a buck,
you're gonna get there.

454
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,439
If it ends up
you got some money left over,

455
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,608
buy yourself some pants and a real car."

456
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,655
I would say to the Postal Service,

457
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:17,284
"If you actually wanted to be helpful
to us,

458
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:18,910
just open the letters,

459
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,330
read 'em, and e-mail us what it says!

460
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,050
We'll give you a penny
for each one you do...

461
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:38,763
...since that seems to be a lot of money
in your world."

462
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,018
But we are all human.

463
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:45,894
Human.

464
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:50,191
The human is a social species,
as we can see.

465
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,652
We tend to congregate,

466
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:56,656
aggregate, and coagulate together.

467
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,159
We live here in New York City.

468
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,745
That makes no sense.

469
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,539
If you take a plane out of New York,

470
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,625
and you look down at the city,

471
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,210
what do you see around the city?

472
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,631
Why, there's nothing but empty, open,
beautiful, rolling land out there.

473
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,507
Nobody's there!

474
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,552
"Let's pack in here, tight!"

475
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:22,098
Uncomfortable, on top of each other,
traffic, congestion!

476
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,643
That's what we like!

477
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,605
Human beings like to be close together

478
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:32,484
because it makes it easier for us
to judge and criticize...

479
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,156
...the personalities
and activities of these humans.

480
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:42,494
We like to give our thoughts,
our comments, our opinions.

481
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,663
Sometimes, we run out of opinions.

482
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,830
We make them up.

483
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,166
"It is what it is"

484
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:52,003
is a very popular opinion statement
nowadays.

485
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,673
I'm sure some idiot said it to you today.

486
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,550
You can't get through a day
without somebody going,

487
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,053
"Well, it is what it is."

488
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:04,349
Why are you alive?

489
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:12,273
To just say air words that fill the room
with meaningless sounds?

490
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:16,528
I'd rather someone blew clear air
into my face

491
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,406
than said, "It is what it is"
to me one more time.

492
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,200
Just... just come up to me and go...

493
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,205
'Cause I get the same data from that!

494
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,418
People like to say those things.
"It is what it is."

495
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,379
You see,
if you repeat a word twice in a sentence,

496
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,142
you can say that with a lot of confidence.

497
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,716
"Business is business."

498
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,635
"Rules are rules."

499
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:43,930
"Deal's a deal."

500
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:45,931
"When we go in there,

501
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,184
as long as we know what's what
and who's who,

502
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,146
whatever happens, happens,
and it is what it is."

503
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,734
Jerry!

504
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,368
We also like to say things
to make ourselves feel better.

505
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,705
"Well, at least he died
doin' something that he loved."

506
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,416
Yeah, well, okay...

507
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,627
but he's not doin' that anymore.

508
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:20,091
Also, not sure how in love with it
he would still be...

509
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,511
after the very negative outcome.

510
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,098
I'd like to die
doin' somethin' that I hate

511
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,559
like cleaning
a row of outdoor Porta Pottis.

512
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,439
Clutch my chest, drop the brush,
keel over, and go,

513
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,691
"Fantastic. At least I'm done with that."

514
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,701
And when one does have occasion

515
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,997
to avail oneself of one of these portable,
plastic, outdoor public toilets,

516
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,918
that's a very different place
than any other place you go in life,

517
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,629
and you're a little different, too,
when you come out.

518
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,590
A little shook up, like a combat veteran

519
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,759
or somebody that works
at a trauma center.

520
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,595
"You all right?" "Yeah, no, I'm fine.

521
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,098
I just need some time. I'll be all right.

522
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,351
I'm gonna take a walk.

523
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,770
I need to think... about my life.

524
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:17,649
It just doesn't feel like it's goin'
in the direction I wanted it to go."

525
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:22,654
And by the way, never marry anyone
that comes out of one of these bathrooms

526
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,031
and goes, "It's not that bad in there."

527
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,954
Do not marry that person.

528
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:35,500
You have a lot of fantastic qualities.
You will eventually meet someone.

529
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,378
Do not settle for
an individual of this caliber.

530
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,507
Because it's very easy to use
these bathrooms.

531
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,885
I always find the spring tension
on the door

532
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,138
to be a little lighter
than I thought it was gonna be.

533
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,392
The door opens so easily, so welcoming.

534
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,310
"Come on in. We have something for you."

535
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,982
A place to relieve yourself
in exchange for a mental image picture

536
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,025
that will cause you to twitch
in your sleep

537
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,069
every night for a year and a half...

538
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,697
with PTSD:

539
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,868
"Portable Toilet Spring Door."

540
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,747
I don't even know
how they're allowed to call it a bathroom.

541
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:18,501
It's not a bath... You're... you're crapping
in a hole with a box over it.

542
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,670
It's beastly!

543
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,298
It's hyena living!

544
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:27,570
You wanna do that thing your dog does
after going to the bathroom in the grass.

545
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,262
You know that little move they make?

546
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,849
You wanna do that
after you've used one of these things.

547
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,059
"Why you doin' that?"

548
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:38,354
"I'm tryin' to get the last few minutes
outta my mind. That's all."

549
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,026
You're a great audience.
This is really fun.

550
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,111
Thank you so much for bein' here.

551
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,866
- Hey, Jerry!
- Dude.

552
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,328
All right.

553
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:56,915
Let's change gears at this point
in our lovely time together here.

554
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:00,293
So, those are things
that I see in the outside world.

555
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:03,212
Now, I wanna take you
into Jerry's little world...

556
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:08,968
and give you a little perspective
on what's going on in my personal life.

557
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:12,472
First, I will give you the basic numbers.
Everybody likes the numbers.

558
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,724
I'm 65 years old.

559
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:18,227
I apologize for the shock value...

560
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,479
...of that number.

561
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:22,148
I am married for 19 years.

562
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,650
I have three kids.

563
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,569
My oldest is my daughter.
I have two younger boys.

564
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,655
I love being in my sixties.

565
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,491
It's my favorite decade of human life
so far.

566
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:34,369
When you're in your sixties,
people ask you to do somethin',

567
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,537
you just say no.

568
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,169
No reason, no excuse, no explanation.

569
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,131
I can't wait for my seventies.
I don't even think I'll answer.

570
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:53,471
I've seen those people. You just wave
when you're in your seventies.

571
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,224
"Hey, you wanna check out
that flea market?"

572
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,027
I like this time.

573
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:09,988
It's relaxing.

574
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:14,242
I don't wanna grow. I don't wanna change.
I don't want to improve in anything.

575
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,703
I don't want to expand my interests,

576
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,998
meet anyone, or learn anything
I don't already know.

577
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,460
I don't lie in restaurants anymore.

578
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,754
"How is everything?"
"I don't like it here."

579
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,261
"Want the check?"
"No, I intend to press charges.

580
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,387
This is outrageous."

581
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,310
I don't like to turn around. Like,
if I'm walkin' down the street like this...

582
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,187
"Jerry, check this out.
You gotta see this."

583
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,582
This move. I don't...
I don't like doing this thing anymore.

584
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:46,899
I just don't wanna do it.

585
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:47,984
"You gotta see this."

586
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:50,069
"I disagree."

587
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,822
I don't feel old, I don't feel tired;

588
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,657
I've just seen a lot of things.

589
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,403
I'll see it on the way back,
when it's in front of me.

590
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,452
How 'bout that?

591
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,537
Or I won't see it.

592
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,538
Or I'll Google it.

593
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,539
Or I'll just assume

594
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,293
it's probably a lot like something else
I've already seen.

595
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,091
A lot of people around my age
make a bucket list.

596
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,089
I made a bucket list,

597
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,634
and I turned the <i>b </i>to an <i>f,</i>
and I was done with that, too.

598
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,851
I just want you to have that option.

599
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,729
You can either check off all your items...

600
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,606
or change one letter at the top,

601
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,399
you're in a La-Z-Boy,
watchin' a ball game.

602
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,614
I got married late in life.
I was 45. I had some issues.

603
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,701
I was enjoying those issues quite a bit,
as I recall.

604
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,956
When I was single, I had married friends.
I would not visit their homes.

605
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,627
I found their lives to be pathetic
and depressing.

606
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,797
Now that I'm married,
I have no single friends.

607
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,509
I find their lives to be meaningless
and trivial experiences.

608
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,220
In both cases, I believe I was correct.

609
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,057
Whichever side of marriage you're on,

610
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,601
you don't get
what the other people are doing.

611
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,520
I can't hang out with single guys.

612
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,855
You don't have a wife,
we have nothing to talk about.

613
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,817
You have a girlfriend?
That's Wiffle ball, my friend.

614
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,986
You're playing paintball war;

615
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,405
I'm in Afghanistan
with real, loaded weapons.

616
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:24,455
Married guys play with full clips
and live rounds.

617
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,708
This is not a drill.

618
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:33,089
Single guy's sitting on a merry-go-round,
blowin' on a pinwheel!

619
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,552
I'm drivin' a truck full of nitro
down a dirt road.

620
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,821
You single guys here tonight,
looking at me,

621
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,147
"Hey, Jerry, what if I wanna be
a married guy like you?

622
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,649
What do I gotta have
if I wanna be a married guy?"

623
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,610
I'll tell you.
You better have some answers, buddy.

624
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,697
You better have some answers
for that woman.

625
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,616
Women have a lot of questions.

626
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,035
Their brains are strong,

627
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,621
active, and on high alert at all times.

628
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,749
You're sleeping. She's researching.

629
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:18,134
The female brain is cookin' all the time!

630
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,180
The female brain
is one of the most competent

631
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,974
and capable organs
in all of the biological universe.

632
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,058
Girl power.

633
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,812
You're goddamn right.

634
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,690
There's nothing
the female brain cannot do.

635
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:36,485
It will solve all problems of earth

636
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,945
and... life.

637
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,614
Having completed that,

638
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,532
it will move on to the hypothetical.

639
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,543
Theoretical situations...

640
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,129
that may or may not occur.

641
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:03,429
The female needs to know
how you might respond.

642
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,353
"If you faked your own death,
and I found out about it,

643
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,188
what would you say then?"

644
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,904
"What are we talkin' about now?"

645
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,201
"Oh, I dreamt the whole thing last night,
so don't deny it."

646
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,332
Being married is like being
on a game show,

647
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,167
and you're always in the lightning round.

648
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,964
I went out and bought a game-show podium.
I set it up in my living room.

649
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,925
I wake up in the morning,
and I stand behind the podium,

650
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,553
tryin' to answer all my wife's questions
and get on with the goddamn day.

651
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,349
I got a hand button-clicker.

652
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,686
"I'll take 'Movies
I Think We Saw Together' for 200."

653
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,775
My wife, of course,
is the returning champion from last week.

654
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,861
"I'll take
'Details of a Ten-Minute Conversation

655
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,489
We Had at Three O'Clock in the Morning
Eight Years Ago.'

656
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,455
And I would like to bet
everything I have on that, Alex.

657
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,127
I'm going for the win right here."

658
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,046
The husband, of course, never has a clue.

659
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,383
"I'm sorry, sir.
You did not win the weekend sex package...

660
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,220
...or the guilt-free
televised sporting event.

661
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,766
Thank you for playing.
Are you even listening to me?

662
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,148
And don't forget to take
that big bag of garbage

663
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,266
with you on your way out...

664
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:36,981
of the studio."

665
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,702
One of the things I did not know
before I got married

666
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,495
that I found out after I got married

667
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,299
is that
every single day of my married life,

668
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,750
I would be discussing
the tone of my voice.

669
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,713
I was not aware, as a single man,

670
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:04,425
that I so often speak
in the incorrect tone.

671
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,889
I thought it was a marriage.
Apparently, it's a musical.

672
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,894
I walk around the house with one
of those round, black glee-club things.

673
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,856
How 'bout that one?

674
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,529
Am I gettin' closer?

675
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,742
"It's your tone." "My tone?"
"Yes, your tone."

676
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:33,871
"What's wrong with my tone?"
"I don't like your tone."

677
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:38,042
"What do you want me to...?"
"You better change your tone!"

678
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:41,711
Ever heard that?

679
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,799
And women are correct, as they always are.

680
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:50,388
The male tone changes
over the course of the relationship.

681
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,474
In the beginning,
as the male pursues the female,

682
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,685
in the courting or flirting phase,

683
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,604
we speak two octaves higher.

684
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,523
We raise our voice two octaves.

685
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,926
We talk like this in the beginning.

686
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,737
Because Chinese food
or Italian sounds great.

687
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,952
Maybe we'll take a drive
or go for a walk.

688
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:19,083
My actual speaking voice
that I am using right now

689
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,335
to communicate with you

690
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,380
is not welcome in my house.

691
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,176
That's why I'm out here talkin' to you.

692
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,187
Do you think that I talk like this...

693
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:43,065
in my house, with this authority?

694
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:50,448
The little edge in my voice?
You think I speak like that in my house?

695
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,116
I do not.

696
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:57,037
If I walked into my own house,

697
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,624
which I paid for, by the way.
Not relevant, just wanted to mention it.

698
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,922
If I said, like this...

699
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,007
If I said,

700
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,384
"I gotta get somethin' to eat!"

701
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,764
If I said it like that...
First of all, any guy I know would say,

702
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:19,018
"Eat whatever the hell you want.
I don't care what you eat."

703
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,771
Any woman will say,
"Why are you yelling at me?"

704
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,692
"I'm not yelling!

705
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,236
I'm just hungry!"

706
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,864
And then the fight breaks out,

707
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:34,492
and when the fight breaks out,
now you're white-water kayaking.

708
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,536
You got a plastic helmet on.
You're goin' under. You're poppin' up.

709
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,704
Just keep paddling.

710
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,044
That's when the woman's
tone of voice changes.

711
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,795
Yes, the women are included in this, too.

712
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,965
All women, at some point
in every argument with the man,

713
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,760
like to imitate the voice of the man.

714
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:56,180
In the amazing organizational system
that women have,

715
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:59,725
they have all somehow worked out
to do the same impression.

716
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,454
"You always say,
'Oh no, I can't do things like that.

717
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,230
That's not what I said I was gonna do.'

718
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,524
You said, 'I might go.'
You said, 'Definitely go.'

719
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,568
'Oh, I don't think... I don't think
that I'd feel comfortable.'

720
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,363
You go, 'Oh, with your friends.
We're goin' with your friends.'

721
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,446
It's not like my friends.
With my friends, you say,

722
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,909
'Oh, I don't think that I could...'"

723
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,089
Who the hell is this guy?

724
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,040
Where did you see this guy?

725
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,044
I never heard anyone talk like this.

726
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,205
"That's because you don't hear yourself.

727
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,715
You should hear how you sound.

728
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,218
You go, 'Oh, I don't think... You know.'"

729
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,722
It reminds me of that Lollipop Guild guy:

730
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:42,476
♪ <i>Oh, we represent the Lollipop Guild</i> ♪

731
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,779
It's all about listening.

732
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,823
Want some marriage advice?

733
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,700
Ya better listen up!

734
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:03,080
A lot of wives complain
that their husbands do not listen.

735
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,875
I have never heard my wife say this.
She may have.

736
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,671
I don't know, but...

737
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,258
here's what I do know.

738
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,179
Ladies, your husband
wants to make you happy.

739
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,932
He's workin' on it!

740
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:24,851
He's planning it.

741
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,271
He's thinking about it every second.

742
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:29,857
He cannot do it.

743
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,943
He cannot do it.

744
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,739
He does not know how to do it.

745
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,825
Sometimes, we do it.

746
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,077
We don't know how we did it.

747
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,207
We can't ask, "What did I do?"

748
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,086
That looks like you don't know
what you're doing.

749
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,214
Can't do nothing.

750
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:57,301
Woman says,
"I can't believe you're doing this."

751
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,219
Man says, "Doing what?"

752
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:01,805
Woman starts crying.

753
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,933
Man says, "I didn't do anything."

754
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,269
Woman says, "Exactly."

755
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,733
So, it's a bit of a chess game, isn't it?

756
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,361
Except, the board is flowing water...

757
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:18,822
and all the chess pieces

758
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,324
are made of smoke.

759
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,341
And you're not alone.
Don't ever forget that in marriage.

760
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,885
Society, culture, technology, even,

761
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:43,055
is helping you
on your journey of marriage.

762
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,640
In your car, for example,

763
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:47,726
dual-zone, separate buttons,
on each side,

764
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,354
climate control systems.

765
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,982
Gee, I wonder if it was a married person
that thought of that...

766
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,904
and thought, "Hey,
this could potentially come in handy

767
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,657
if you're with someone
you're legally bound to

768
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,033
for the rest of your life

769
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,411
and you need them to shut the hell up."

770
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,498
"I'm freezin'! I'm roastin'! I'm boilin'!

771
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,710
It's blowin' on me!"

772
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,131
When my wife says, "The air is on me,"

773
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:21,385
it is the equivalent of a normal person
saying, "A bear is on me."

774
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,681
That's the emergency level.

775
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,143
And I respond at that level, too.

776
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,645
"Oh, my God.
An evil breeze from a hostile vent

777
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,397
is attacking my mate and life partner,

778
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,941
who incidentally bore me three children
without anesthesia.

779
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:38,664
Probably could have caught
the babies herself if no one was around,

780
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,279
but cannot survive a waft of air

781
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,906
three degrees
off her optimum desired temperature."

782
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:53,542
And I'm sure this stupid dual-zone thing
totally works, too,

783
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,961
to keep
different-temperature air molecules

784
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,379
from commingling

785
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:02,551
inside a three-foot wide,
closed compartment of an automobile.

786
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,554
Because I go to my coffee place
in the morning...

787
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,848
I like to get my coffee black
on the left side of the cup,

788
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,641
cream and sugar on the right,

789
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,936
and that's no problem.

790
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,344
Or you go to fancy restaurants.

791
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,709
Sometimes they say,
"Do you want still or sparkling water?"

792
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,985
I go, "Both.
Same glass, keep 'em separate.

793
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:22,070
I do it in my car all the time."

794
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:28,368
Here's a marriage moment I saw for real.

795
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,456
Husband in the car, wife on the sidewalk.

796
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,583
He's picking her up after work.

797
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:39,880
He did not bring the car
to a full and complete stop!

798
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,841
She had the door open.

799
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:46,386
She was hopping on one foot...

800
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:52,267
...trying to get some kind of leverage
on the armrest of...

801
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:56,480
You can only get one foot in a moving car.

802
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:02,736
One can only imagine
the spirited exchange of ideas...

803
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:07,032
that took place in that car
the rest of the drive home.

804
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,452
But that's what marriage is.

805
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:11,829
It's two people...

806
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:16,291
trying to stay together
without saying the words "I hate you."

807
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:22,172
Which you're not allowed to say. Okay?

808
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,174
You can't say that.

809
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,802
You can feel it.

810
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:29,929
That's okay.

811
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:31,890
Don't let it come...

812
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,100
...out.

813
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,519
Say something else. Anything.

814
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:38,564
Say, "Why is there never any Scotch Tape
in this goddamn house?"

815
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,528
"Scotch" is "I," "tape" is "hate,"
"house" is "you."

816
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,406
But it's better.

817
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,617
You don't say,
"I could kill you right now."

818
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,996
You say, "You're so funny sometimes."

819
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:03,297
"So, Jerry, we would like to understand
in a little more detail

820
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:06,008
exactly how you pulled this off,
'cause we...

821
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:09,052
We saw that you were,
uh, just a single, regular,

822
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,179
bachelor guy, 45 years.

823
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,016
And then all of a sudden, you just...
You just turned on a dime.

824
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,810
Marriage, wife, kids, family.
How'd you navigate that?

825
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,228
How'd you acclimate?

826
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:21,064
How did you procreate and cohabitate,

827
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,774
learning to accommodate

828
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:26,028
so as not to aggravate?"

829
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,113
It's a very good question,

830
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,908
because a man in marriage will not survive

831
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,369
if he does not have
a strong brain-to-speech

832
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:37,331
guard-gate control filtration system.

833
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:41,209
You don't just talk in marriage!

834
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:43,669
It's risky.

835
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:48,008
When I'm with my wife,
who I love so dearly,

836
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,260
and a thought enters my head,

837
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:54,681
the first thing I think is,
"Well, I know I can't say <i>that."</i>

838
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,482
Maybe I could say
I heard someone else say it.

839
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:08,946
And then she and I can share
a warm moment together,

840
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,740
agreeing on what an idiot
that person must be.

841
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,203
And we get along great.

842
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,638
So, we have three kids. I told you that.

843
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,917
We just came back
from a lovey family vacation,

844
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,168
or what I like to call:

845
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,671
"Let's pay a lot of money to go fight
in a hotel."

846
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:32,219
I don't know
what the hell else we were doing.

847
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,138
Let's fight on bikes.

848
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,811
"I'm gonna kill you."
"I'm gonna kill you more."

849
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:46,233
Let's use profanity
on a pristine, white-sand beach.

850
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:52,280
Let's fight about how well-behaved
those other children seem to be.

851
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:56,243
I wonder if they were out
on the hotel balcony last night

852
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,328
with 12-dollar minibar cashews,

853
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,163
trying to hit the other guests
in the head.

854
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,799
So, my daughter is, uh, my oldest.

855
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:14,219
She's 18, and she just, uh, finished
high school, went off to college.

856
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:18,056
Big... That's kind of a big, you know,
step when you're parents.

857
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,225
Thank you.

858
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,602
We did a great job.

859
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,689
She finished high school.

860
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:28,209
So, a lot of people...
You know, everybody's asking me,

861
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:31,194
"How do you feel, Jerry?
You know, first kid leaving the house?"

862
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,194
And I'm good.

863
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,573
I'm okay. I'm okay.

864
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:37,701
The way I look at it, it's like
if you somehow found a baby alligator

865
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,620
and you put it in your tub,
and everybody would...

866
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,040
"Look at this. I found this. Baby alli...

867
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,123
Look. Put your finger in his mouth.
Feel the teeth?

868
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,419
Little teeth, little bitey, bitey teeth."

869
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,839
And then time passes, and you go,

870
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,778
"You know, I think we gotta get this thing
the hell outta here.

871
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,013
This is, uh...

872
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,265
This doesn't feel right anymore.

873
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:03,185
This thing is... it's scary.

874
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:05,479
This thing needs to be out there,

875
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,982
murdering other living things
and eating them.

876
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,027
That... that's what it's supposed to do."

877
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,978
But I love being a dad.
I was there at the birth.

878
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,618
Obviously,
the most dramatic human life moment.

879
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:22,662
Anytime two people walk into a room,
and three come out...

880
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:26,374
a major event took place in that room.

881
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:31,338
At the end of life,
we go back basically into the same room,

882
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,757
same bed, same stuff around.

883
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:37,427
And again,
a different number of people coming out

884
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,012
than went in,

885
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,723
but that is the human-being business.

886
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,726
We gotta turn inventory, fresh product,

887
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,686
keep the supply chain moving.

888
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:51,566
We gotta get 'em in. We gotta get 'em out.
That's the hospital's job.

889
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,027
It's rest, cleanliness.

890
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,321
If it doesn't work out,
we help you move on.

891
00:51:56,988 --> 00:52:00,909
It says "hospital" when you walk in,
but it could also be "Bed Bath & Beyond."

892
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,460
'Cause the babies never stop coming.
Babies don't care.

893
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,712
You think babies care
that the world's a mess,

894
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:13,839
you have issues?

895
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:14,965
"We're comin' in!

896
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,592
We want in!"

897
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,719
They come in
like racks of fresh doughnuts.

898
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:23,181
More babies. More babies.
More babies.

899
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,057
Why are they here?

900
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,978
They are here to replace us.

901
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,230
That is their mission.

902
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:33,984
Don't you see what's happening?

903
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,945
They're pushing us out.

904
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:40,323
Their first words are "mama," "dada,"

905
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,407
and "buh-bye."

906
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:49,124
"Oh, we'll see who's wearing the diapers
when this is all over."

907
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,546
That's what the babies are thinking.

908
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:59,009
But again,
the father, struggling to keep pace.

909
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:03,680
Moms that are here,
we want to be what you want us to be.

910
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,182
We can't do it!

911
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:07,976
We want to do it.

912
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:11,730
The baby's born. I remember...
It's just the most amazing thing.

913
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:14,357
For the female,
just these instincts just kick in.

914
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,320
For the man, nothing kicks in.

915
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:22,365
He's just the same guy, standin' there.

916
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:30,457
It was years into my children's lives,
I'd see them staring at me

917
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,709
from across the room
like they were gonna come and say,

918
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,961
"I'm sorry, is someone helping you?

919
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:43,261
Mom, the horsey-ride guy is here again.
Do we need anything?"

920
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:49,184
Avoidance is the male domestic instinct.

921
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:52,103
Golf, the ultimate avoidance activity.

922
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,939
A game so nonsensically difficult,

923
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,149
so pointless, so irrational,
so time-consuming,

924
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:59,027
the world "golf"
could only possibly stand for:

925
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,904
"get out, leave family."

926
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,159
And I have a lot of friends that play.
They love it. Oh, they love it.

927
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,786
"Jerry, you would love it.

928
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:11,289
It's a very challenging game."

929
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,209
"Yes, I am sure that it is.

930
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:18,838
It's also challenging trying to throw
a Tic Tac 100 yards into a shoebox."

931
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,972
In the fantasy mind of the golfing father,
when he comes home,

932
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,890
the family will come running out

933
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:33,103
to hear the exciting stories
of his golfing adventures.

934
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:38,775
In reality, no one is even aware
that he has left or returned...

935
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:45,907
from eight and a half hours
of idiotic hacking through sand and weeds

936
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:49,035
while driving drunk in a clown car
through a fake park.

937
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,794
Nonetheless, the father remains proud...

938
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:04,009
dressing in bizarre outfits
around the house on the weekends.

939
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,636
All fathers essentially dress

940
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,931
in the clothing style
of the last good year of their lives.

941
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:15,103
Whatever a man was wearing
around the time he got married,

942
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:17,314
he freezes that moment

943
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:21,568
in fashion history
and rides it out to the end.

944
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:29,826
You see fathers on the street:
'05, '91, '83.

945
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:35,081
Took the kids to the movies the other day.

946
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,834
New announcement in the movie theater
I hadn't seen before:

947
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:42,130
"Please pick up the garbage
from around your seat after the movie."

948
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:43,673
"Oh, okay.

949
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:48,887
Maybe I'll bring my orange jumpsuit
and a wooden stick with a nail in it, too.

950
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:54,976
Maybe I'll work my way down the highway
after the credits."

951
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,397
I'm not pickin' nothin' up!

952
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,400
I'm the one that threw it down.

953
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:07,614
There's a deal in place
between us and the movie theater people.

954
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,949
The deal is, you're rippin' us off!

955
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,912
In exchange for that,
when I'm done with something,

956
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:15,372
I open my hand.

957
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,253
Let it roll down eight rows.

958
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:26,466
I'm not sticking my arm
into that dark, scary hole...

959
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:31,012
tryin' to pry out three Goobers
that have been solder welded there

960
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,722
since <i>The Shawshank Redemption.</i>

961
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,059
What have they done for us?

962
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:39,687
What... what? You gave us a cup holder?
Is that our luxury feature?

963
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:43,483
How about an automatic popcorn shooter
that fires one in every five seconds...

964
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:46,236
to complete this corpse-like experience?

965
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:54,702
The cup holder, that is the object
that defines our culture.

966
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,329
"We're not holding cups!

967
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:58,706
We don't wanna grip!"

968
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:01,668
Hands-free.

969
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,296
Give me a cowboy hat
with a beer on each side

970
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,965
and a feeding tube comin' down.

971
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:10,793
Give me a dog leash
with an extra leash wound up in it,

972
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,524
in case the dog pulls it,
I hit the button,

973
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:14,639
let the line out like he's a marlin.

974
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:17,809
I go into a public restroom,

975
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:21,521
I expect a motion detector
on the toilet, sink, urinal.

976
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,022
I'm doin' nothin' in here.

977
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:28,153
Why is the sink never as aware of us
as the toilet?

978
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,423
You always have to go
into a David Copperfield magic act

979
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,405
to make that work.

980
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:43,793
Who designed the bathroom stall
with the under-display viewing window?

981
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:49,174
So we can all see
the lifeless, collapsed pant legs

982
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:53,303
and tragic little shoe fronts
that are just barely poking out

983
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:57,098
from underneath the impotent belt,
lying helpless.

984
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:02,896
How much more money is it
to bring this wall down another foot?

985
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:07,066
It's the cheapest wall in the world.

986
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:08,818
It's a metal panel.

987
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:12,780
They don't even make the panels
meet up <i>tight </i>in the <i>corners!</i>

988
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:16,367
Why can't they cinch it up?

989
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,828
Sometimes, you're walkin' by,

990
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:21,080
you see a frightened,
terrorized human eye.

991
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:29,088
You ever see just a flash of eye white
in the space?

992
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,172
Just a pupil?

993
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,093
Why are we doing this to people?

994
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:37,889
I'm not a horse.
I don't wanna be in a stall.

995
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,784
If it's a stall, why don't I hang my head
over the door?

996
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,143
That's what the horses do.

997
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:46,648
I'm sure my coworkers
recognize my shoes.

998
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,525
Let's let 'em see my face, too.

999
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,779
"Hey, Bob, how you doing?

1000
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:57,534
Yeah, this is why I had to run
out of that big meeting.

1001
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:02,121
I had a little PowerPoint presentation
of my own to do."

1002
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:05,041
Thank you, New York City.
You've been the best!

1003
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:07,353
I love you guys.

1004
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:10,171
You made me. I appreciate it.

1005
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,465
Thanks for comin' in to see our show.

1006
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,175
Hope you enjoyed it.

1007
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:16,468
Good night.

you'd move forward a little bit
