2
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,750
Lydia! Kitty!

3
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,150
My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard?

4
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,950
Netherfield Park is let at last. Do you
not want to know who has taken it?

5
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:06,050
As you wish to tell me, my dear,
I doubt I have any choice in the matter.

6
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,050
Kitty, what have I told you
about listening at the door?

7
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,050
There's a Mr Bingley
arrived from the North.

8
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,450
- Five thousand a year!
- Really?

9
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,350
- He's single!
- Who's single?

10
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,150
A Mr Bingley, apparently. Kitty!

11
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,150
How can that possibly affect them?

12
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,550
Mr Bennet,
how can you be so tiresome?

13
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,050
You know he must marry one of them.

14
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,250
That is his design in settling here?

15
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,750
You must go and visit him at once.

16
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,850
Good heavens. People.

17
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,250
For we may not visit if you do not,
as you well know, Mr Bennet.

18
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,650
- Are you listening? You never listen.
- You must, Papa! At once!

19
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,450
There's no need. I already have.

20
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,150
- You have?
- When?

21
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,850
Oh, Mr Bennet,
how can you tease me so?

22
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,450
Have you no compassion
for my poor nerves?

23
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,250
You mistake me, my dear.
I have the highest respect for them.

24
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,650
They've been my constant companions
these twenty years.

25
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,950
Papa!

26
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,350
- Is he amiable?
- Who?

27
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,950
- Is he handsome?
- He's sure to be.

28
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,250
With 5,000 a year,
it would not matter if he had warts.

29
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,850
Who's got warts?

30
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,250
I will consent to
his marrying whichever girl he chooses.

31
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,550
- So will he come to the ball tomorrow?
- I believe so.

32
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,650
- Mr Bennet!
- I have to have your muslin!

33
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,750
- I'll lend you my green slippers!
- They were mine.

34
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,550
- I'll do your mending for a week.
- I'll retrim your new bonnet.

35
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,650
Two weeks I'll do it for.

36
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,050
It's not the same!
It's not the same.

37
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,250
I can't breathe.

38
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,750
I think one of
my toes just came off.

39
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,850
If every man does not end the evening
in love with you,

40
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,950
then I'm no judge of beauty.

41
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,050
- Or men.
- No, they are far too easy to judge.

42
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,850
They're not all bad.

43
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,750
Humourless poppycocks,
in my limited experience.

44
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,350
One day,
someone will catch your eye,

45
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,950
and then you'll have
to watch your tongue.

46
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,350
How good of you to come.

47
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,250
Which of the painted peacocks
is our Mr Bingley?

48
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,050
He's on the right.
On the left is his sister.

49
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:41,150
- The person with the quizzical brow?
- That is his good friend, Mr Darcy.

50
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,750
- He looks miserable, poor soul.
- He may be, but poor he is not.

51
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,150
Tell me.

52
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,050
10,000 a year,
and he owns half of Derbyshire.

53
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,250
The miserable half.

54
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:24,450
Mr Bennet, you must introduce him
to the girls immediately.

55
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,250
Smile at Mr Bingley. Smile.

56
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,850
Mary.

57
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,850
Mr Bingley, my eldest daughter you know.

58
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,450
Mrs Bennet, Miss Jane Bennet,
Elizabeth and Miss Mary Bennet.

59
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,350
It is a pleasure. I have two others,
but they're already dancing.

60
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,050
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.

61
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,450
And may I introduce Mr Darcy
of Pemberley in Derbyshire.

62
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,350
How do you like it
here in Hertfordshire?

63
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,550
Very much.

64
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:33,050
The library at Netherfield,
I've heard, is one of the finest.

65
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,550
It fills me with guilt. I'm not a good
reader. I prefer being out of doors.

66
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,350
Oh, I mean, I can read, of course.

67
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,950
And I'm not suggesting
you can't read out of doors.

68
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,950
I wish I read more, but there
seem to be so many other things to do.

69
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,350
That's exactly what I meant.

70
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,350
Mama, Mama! You will never, ever believe
what we're about to tell you.

71
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,250
- Tell me!
- She's going to take the veil.

72
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,750
- The regiment are coming!
- Officers?

73
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,150
They're going to be stationed
the whole winter, right here.

74
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,950
- Officers?
- As far as the eye can see.

75
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,250
Oh, look.
Jane's dancing with Mr Bingley.

76
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,050
Mr Bennet.

77
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,250
- Do you dance, Mr Darcy?
- Not if I can help it.

78
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,250
I didn't know you were coming
to see me. What's the matter?

79
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:06,950
We are a long way from Grosvenor Square,
are we not, Mr Darcy?

80
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,550
I've never seen so many pretty girls.

81
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,150
You were dancing
with the only handsome girl.

82
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,350
She is the most beautiful creature
I have ever beheld.

83
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:19,750
- But her sister Elizabeth is agreeable.
- Perfectly tolerable.

84
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:24,250
Not handsome enough to tempt me. Return
to your partner and enjoy her smiles.

85
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,950
You're wasting your time with me.

86
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,350
Count your blessings, Lizzie. If he
liked you, you'd have to talk to him.

87
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,950
Precisely.

88
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,850
I wouldn't dance with him
for all of Derbyshire,

89
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,350
let alone the miserable half.

90
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,550
Wait!

91
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:08,750
- I enjoyed that so much, Miss Lucas.
- How well you dance, Mr Bingley.

92
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,450
I've never enjoyed a dance so much.

93
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,450
My daughter Jane
is a splendid dancer, is she not?

94
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,650
She is indeed.

95
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,750
Your friend Miss Lucas
is a most amusing young woman.

96
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,650
Oh, yes, I adore her.

97
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,950
- It is a pity she's not more handsome.
- Mama!

98
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,650
Oh, but Lizzie
would never admit that she's plain.

99
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,050
Of course, it's my Jane who's considered
the beauty of the county.

100
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,250
Mama, please!

101
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,550
When she was 15, a gentleman
was so much in love with her,

102
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,950
I was sure he would make her an offer.

103
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,650
However, he did write her
some very pretty verses.

104
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,150
And that put paid to it.

105
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,650
I wonder who discovered the power
of poetry in driving away love.

106
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:54,250
- I thought poetry was the food of love.
- Of a fine, stout love.

107
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,850
But if it is only a vague inclination,
one poor sonnet will kill it.

108
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,150
So, what do you recommend
to encourage affection?

109
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:07,950
Dancing. Even if one's partner
is barely tolerable.

110
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,950
Mr Bingley is just what
a young man ought to be.

111
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,650
- Sensible, good-humoured...
- Handsome, conveniently rich...

112
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,650
Marriage should not be driven
by thoughts of money.

113
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,050
Only deep love
will persuade me to marry.

114
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,850
- Which is why I'll end up an old maid.
- Do you really believe he liked me?

115
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,550
He danced with you most of the night,
and stared at you the rest.

116
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,750
I give you leave to like him.
You've liked many stupider.

117
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,150
You're a great deal too apt
to like people in general.

118
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,350
All the world
is good in your eyes.

119
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,750
Not his friend. I still can't believe
what he said about you.

120
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,450
Mr Darcy?

121
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:11,250
I'd more easily forgive his vanity
had he not wounded mine.

122
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,350
But no matter.
I doubt we shall ever speak again.

123
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,050
He danced with Miss Lucas.

124
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,050
We were all there, dear.

125
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,350
It is a shame she's not more handsome.

126
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,250
There's a spinster
in the making and no mistake.

127
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,150
The fourth with a Miss King
of little standing,

128
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,350
and the fifth again with Jane.

129
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,850
If he had any compassion,
he would've sprained his ankle.

130
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,150
The way you carry on,

131
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:08,450
you'd think our girls look forward
to a grand inheritance.

132
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,850
When you die,
which may be very soon,

133
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:15,450
they will be left without a roof over
their head nor a penny to their name.

134
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:19,250
- Please, it's ten in the morning.
- A letter to Miss Bennet, ma'am.

135
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,050
From Netherfield Hall.

136
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:26,850
Praise the Lord. We are saved!

137
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,950
Make haste, Jane,
make haste. Oh, happy day!

138
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,050
It is from Caroline Bingley.

139
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,850
She has invited me to dine with her.

140
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,250
- Her brother will be dining out.
- Dining out?

141
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,450
- Can I take the carriage?
- Let me see.

142
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,250
- It is too far to walk.
- This is unaccountable of him.

143
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,350
Mama, the carriage for Jane?

144
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,050
Certainly not. She'll go on horseback.

145
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,150
Horseback!

146
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,350
Lizzie.

147
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,850
Now she'll have to stay the night,
exactly as I predicted.

148
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,150
Good grief, woman,
your skills in the art of matchmaking

149
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,350
are positively occult.

150
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,950
Though I don't think, Mama,
you can take credit for making it rain.

151
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,350
"My friends will not hear of me
returning home until I am better.

152
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,650
Excepting a sore throat, a fever and
a headache, nothing is wrong with me."

153
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:49,950
If Jane does die it will be a comfort
to know it was in pursuit of Mr Bingley.

154
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,550
People do not die of colds.

155
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,150
But she may perish with the
shame of having such a mother.

156
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,050
I must go to Netherfield at once.

157
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:18,050
Lady Bathurst is redecorating
her ballroom in the French style.

158
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:21,450
A little unpatriotic, don't you think?

159
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,050
Miss Elizabeth Bennet.

160
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,950
Good Lord, did you walk here?

161
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,250
I did.

162
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,450
- I'm so sorry. How is my sister?
- She's upstairs.

163
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,750
Thank you.

164
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,950
My goodness, did you
see her hem? Six inches deep in mud.

165
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,450
She looked positively mediaeval.

166
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:22,150
I feel such a terrible imposition.
They're being so kind to me.

167
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:27,750
I don't know who is more pleased at your
being here, Mama or Mr Bingley.

168
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,550
Thank you for tending
to my sister so diligently.

169
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,050
She's in far better comfort
than at home.

170
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,950
It's a pleasure.

171
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,950
I mean, it's not a pleasure
that she's ill. Of course not.

172
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,950
It's a pleasure that she's here,
being ill.

173
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,450
Not going to be famous, our pig.

174
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,950
Black on the back, but not related
to the learned pig of Norwich.

175
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,250
- Now that pig is...
- Mr Bennet.

176
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:03,750
It's all going to plan.
He's half in love with her already.

177
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,250
- Who is, blossom?
- Mr Bingley.

178
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,750
He doesn't mind
that she hasn't a penny.

179
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,150
He has more than enough
for the two of them.

180
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,350
- How will we meet them?
- Easy!

181
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,550
Wait for me!

182
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:20,050
You drop something. They
pick it up. And then you're introduced.

183
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:28,850
Officers!

184
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,450
You write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy.

185
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,650
You're mistaken. I write slowly.

186
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,450
How many letters you must have occasion
to write, Mr Darcy.

187
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,550
Letters of business.
How odious I should think them.

188
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,550
It is fortunate, then,
they fall to me and not you.

189
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,250
Tell your sister I long to see her.

190
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,750
- I've already told her once.
- I do dote on her.

191
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,250
I was quite in raptures
at her beautiful design for a table.

192
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,650
Perhaps you will give me leave
to defer your raptures.

193
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,050
I have not room enough
to do them justice.

194
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,050
You young ladies are so accomplished.

195
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,650
- What do you mean?
- You paint tables, play the piano

196
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,250
and embroider cushions.

197
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,550
I never heard of a lady,
but people say she's accomplished.

198
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,050
The word is applied too liberally.

199
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,350
I do not know more than
half a dozen women

200
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,250
- that are truly accomplished.
- Nor I.

201
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,650
Goodness, you must comprehend
a great deal in the idea.

202
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,550
- I do.
- Absolutely.

203
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,350
She must have a knowledge of music,
singing, drawing, dancing

204
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,750
and the modern languages
to deserve the word.

205
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,850
And something in her air
and manner of walking.

206
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,950
And she must improve her mind
by extensive reading.

207
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,850
I'm no longer surprised at your knowing
only six accomplished women.

208
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,350
- I wonder at you knowing any.
- Are you so severe on your own sex?

209
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:23,050
I never saw such a woman. She would
certainly be a fearsome thing to behold.

210
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,950
Miss Elizabeth,
let us take a turn about the room.

211
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:50,850
It's refreshing, is it not,
after sitting so long in one attitude?

212
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,350
It is a small kind of accomplishment,
I suppose.

213
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,750
Will you not join us, Mr Darcy?

214
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,450
You can only have two motives,
and I would interfere with either.

215
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,750
What can he mean?

216
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:06,150
The surest way to disappoint him
would be to ask him nothing.

217
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,050
Do tell us, Mr Darcy.

218
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,450
Either you are
in each other's confidence

219
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,750
and you have
secret affairs to discuss,

220
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,250
or you are conscious
that your figures

221
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,550
appear to the greatest
advantage by walking.

222
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,850
If the first,
I should get in your way.

223
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,850
If the second,
I can admire you much better from here.

224
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,550
How shall we punish him
for such a speech?

225
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,650
- We could laugh at him.
- No. Mr Darcy is not to be teased.

226
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:40,450
Are you too proud, Mr Darcy? And would
you consider pride a fault or a virtue?

227
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,650
- I couldn't say.
- We're trying to find a fault in you.

228
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:47,050
I find it hard to forgive
the follies and vices of others,

229
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,050
or their offences against me.

230
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,650
My good opinion,
once lost, is lost forever.

231
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,850
Oh, dear.
I cannot tease you about that.

232
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,150
What a shame,
for I dearly love to laugh.

233
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,550
A family trait, I think.

234
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:36,450
A Mrs Bennet, a Miss Bennet,
a Miss Bennet and a Miss Bennet, sir.

235
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,650
Are we to receive every
Bennet in the country?

236
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,750
What an excellent room you have, sir.

237
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,550
Such expensive furnishings.

238
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,750
I do hope
you intend to stay here, Mr Bingley.

239
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:57,650
Absolutely, I find the country
very diverting. Don't you agree, Darcy?

240
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,650
I find it perfectly adequate.

241
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,750
Even if society
is a little less varied than in town.

242
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,850
Less varied? Not at all.

243
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,950
We dine with four and 20 families
of all shapes and sizes.

244
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:13,650
Sir William Lucas, for instance,
is a very agreeable man.

245
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,550
And a good deal less self-important
than some people half his rank.

246
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,450
Mr Bingley,
is it true you will hold a ball here?

247
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,250
A ball?

248
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:27,950
It would be an excellent way to meet new
friends. You could invite the militia.

249
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,250
- Oh, do hold a ball!
- Kitty!

250
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:33,250
When your sister recovers,
you shall name the day.

251
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:37,850
I think a ball is an irrational way
to gain new acquaintance.

252
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:42,250
It would be better if conversation,
not dancing, were the order of the day.

253
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:46,550
Indeed, much more rational,
but rather less like a ball.

254
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,450
Thank you, Mary.

255
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:53,750
What a fine imposing place to be sure,
is it not, my dears?

256
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:57,350
There's no house
to equal it in the county.

257
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,250
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Bennet.

258
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,250
- There she is.
- I don't know how to thank you.

259
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:05,250
You're welcome any time
you feel the least bit poorly.

260
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:08,650
Thank you for your stimulating company.
Most instructive.

261
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:12,350
Not at all. The pleasure is all mine.

262
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,950
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Elizabeth.

263
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:34,250
And then there was one
with great long lashes, like a cow.

264
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,350
Ask Mrs Hill
to order us a sirloin, Betsy.

265
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,850
Just the one, mind.
We're not made of money.

266
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:47,150
I hope, my dear,
you've ordered a good dinner today.

267
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,250
I've reason to expect
an addition to our family party.

268
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,250
His name's Mr Collins,
the dreaded cousin.

269
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,950
- Who is to inherit?
- Everything.

270
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,950
Even my piano stool
belongs to Mr Collins.

271
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,150
When?

272
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,250
He may turn us out of the house
as soon as he pleases.

273
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,750
The estate passes directly to him
and not to us poor females.

274
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,350
Mr Collins, at your service.

275
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,650
What a superbly featured room
and what excellent potatoes.

276
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:33,850
It's many years since
I've had such an exemplary vegetable.

277
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:38,250
To which fair cousin should I compliment
the excellence of the cooking?

278
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,050
We are perfectly able to keep a cook.

279
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,150
Excellent.

280
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,750
I'm very pleased
the estate can afford such a living.

281
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,750
I'm honoured to have as my patroness
Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

282
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,450
You've heard of her, I presume?

283
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,550
My small rectory abuts her estate,

284
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,550
Rosings Park,
and she often condescends

285
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:09,350
to drive by my humble dwelling
in her little phaeton and ponies.

286
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,250
Does she have any family?

287
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:15,850
One daughter, the heiress of Rosings
and very extensive property.

288
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,350
I've often observed to Lady Catherine

289
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:21,550
that her daughter
seemed born to be a duchess,

290
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:27,350
for she has all the superior graces
of elevated rank.

291
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:31,450
These kind of compliments
are always acceptable to the ladies,

292
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,850
and which I conceive myself
particularly bound to pay.

293
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,650
How happy for you, Mr Collins,

294
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:42,350
to possess the talent for flattering
with such delicacy.

295
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:48,050
Do these attentions proceed
from the impulse of the moment

296
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,650
or are they
the result of previous study?

297
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,350
They arise
from what is passing at the time.

298
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:57,950
And though I do sometimes amuse myself
with arranging such little compliments,

299
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:01,750
I always wish to give them
as unstudied an air as possible.

300
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:06,050
Oh, believe me, no one would suspect
your manners to be rehearsed.

301
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,250
After dinner, I thought
I might read to you for an hour or two.

302
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,450
<i>I have with me Fordyce's Sermons</i>

303
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:24,050
which speak very eloquently
on all matters moral.

304
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,650
<i>Are you familiar with Fordyce's Sermons,
Miss Bennet?</i>

305
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:38,550
Mrs Bennet, I have been bestowed by the
good grace of Lady Catherine de Bourgh

306
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,250
a parsonage of no mean size.

307
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,550
I have become aware of the fact.

308
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:47,650
It is my avowed hope
that soon I may find a mistress for it.

309
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:51,250
And I have to inform you
that the eldest Miss Bennet

310
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:55,250
has captured my special attention.

311
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,250
Oh, Mr Collins.

312
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:02,450
Unfortunately, it is incumbent upon me

313
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:08,750
to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet
is very soon to be engaged.

314
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,450
Engaged.

315
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,050
But Miss Lizzie,
next to her in age and beauty,

316
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:16,650
would make anyone an excellent partner.

317
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:20,850
Do not you agree? Mr Collins?

318
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:25,350
Indeed. Indeed.

319
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,050
A very agreeable alternative.

320
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:53,650
Mr Collins is a man who
makes you despair at the entire sex.

321
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:58,150
- Yours, I believe.
- Oh, Mr Wickham, how perfect you are.

322
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:01,550
He picked up my handkerchief.
Did you drop yours on purpose?

323
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,250
Mr Wickham is a lieutenant.

324
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:06,250
- An enchanted lieutenant.
- What are you up to, Liddy?

325
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:09,450
- We happened to be looking for ribbon.
- White, for the ball.

326
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,150
Shall we all look
for some ribbon together?

327
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:18,750
- Good afternoon, Mr James.
- Miss Lydia, Miss Bennet.

328
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,450
I shan't even browse.

329
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,350
I can't be trusted.
I have poor taste in ribbons.

330
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,050
Only a truly confident man
would admit that.

331
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,750
No, it's true.

332
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:31,050
And buckles.
When it comes to buckles, I'm lost.

333
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,550
- You must be the shame of the regiment.
- The laughing stock.

334
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,950
What do your superiors do with you?

335
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:43,450
Ignore me. I'm of next to no importance,
so it's easily done.

336
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,950
- Lizzie, lend me some money.
- You already owe me a fortune.

337
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:52,350
- Allow me to oblige.
- No, Mr Wickham, please...

338
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,150
I insist.

339
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,350
- I pity the French.
- So do I.

340
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,350
- Look, Mr Bingley.
- Mr Bingley!

341
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,650
I was just on my way to your house.

342
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,950
How do you like
my ribbons for your ball?

343
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:18,550
- Very beautiful.
- She is. Look, she's blooming.

344
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,350
Oh, Lydia.

345
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:24,050
Be sure to invite Mr Wickham.
He is a credit to his profession.

346
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,650
You can't invite people
to other people's balls.

347
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,450
Of course, you must come, Mr Wickham.

348
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:34,950
If you'll excuse me,
ladies, enjoy the day.

349
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:40,950
Do you plan to go
to the Netherfield ball, Mr Wickham?

350
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:46,650
Perhaps. How long
has Mr Darcy been a guest there?

351
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,750
About a month.

352
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:54,350
Forgive me, but are you
acquainted with him, with Mr Darcy?

353
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:58,850
Indeed, I've been connected
with his family since infancy.

354
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,950
You may well be surprised,
given our cold greeting this afternoon.

355
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:10,250
I hope your plans in favour
of Meryton will not be affected

356
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:14,450
- by your relations with the gentleman.
- It is not for me to be driven away.

357
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:19,550
If he wishes to avoid seeing me,
he must go, not I.

358
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:24,450
I must ask, what is the manner
of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?

359
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:30,850
My father managed his estate.

360
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:34,250
We grew up together, Darcy and I.

361
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:40,250
His father treated me like a second son,
loved me like a son.

362
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,050
We were both with him the day he died.

363
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,050
With his last breath,

364
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:50,350
his father bequeathed me
the rectory in his estate.

365
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:54,050
He knew I had my heart set
on joining the Church.

366
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,650
But Darcy ignored his wishes
and gave the living to another man.

367
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,550
- But why?
- Jealousy.

368
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,250
His father...

369
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,450
Well, he loved me better
and Darcy couldn't stand it.

370
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,250
- How cruel.
- So now I'm a poor foot-soldier.

371
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:16,150
Too lowly even to be noticed.

372
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:32,050
- Breathe in!
- I can't anymore. You're hurting.

373
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,750
Betsy.

374
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,350
Betsy!

375
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:54,950
- There must've been a misunderstanding.
- Jane, you never think ill of anybody.

376
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:58,750
How could Mr Darcy do such a thing?

377
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:02,250
I will discover the truth
from Mr Bingley this evening.

378
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,850
Let Mr Darcy contradict it himself.

379
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,350
Till he does,
I hope never to encounter him.

380
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,750
Poor, unfortunate, Mr Wickham.

381
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,150
Wickham is twice the man Darcy is.

382
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,950
And, let us hope,
a rather more willing dancer.

383
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,050
There they are, look.

384
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:26,350
- Oh, yes.
- Billy.

385
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,150
Jane Martin is here.

386
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:05,450
May I say what an immense pleasure
it is to see you again.

387
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,850
- Mrs Bennet.
- Miss Bingley.

388
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,050
Charming.

389
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,750
I'm so pleased you're here.

390
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,150
So am I.

391
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:21,250
And how are you? Miss Elizabeth?
Are you looking for someone?

392
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:25,850
No, not at all, I was just admiring
the general splendour.

393
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,850
- It is breathtaking, Mr Bingley.
- Good.

394
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:42,450
You might have passed
a few pleasantries with Mr Bingley.

395
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:46,450
I've never met a
more pleasant gentleman in all my years.

396
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,050
Did you see how he dotes on her?

397
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:53,850
Dear Jane,
always doing what's best for her family.

398
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,450
- Charlotte!
- Lizzie!

399
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:18,350
- Have you seen Mr Wickham?
- No. Perhaps he's through here.

400
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:34,850
Lizzie, Mr Wickham is not here.
Apparently, he's been detained.

401
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,450
Detained where? He must be here.

402
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:42,850
- There you are.
- Mr Collins.

403
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,450
Perhaps you will do me the honour,
Miss Elizabeth.

404
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:50,750
Oh, I did not think you danced,
Mr Collins.

405
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:55,550
I do not think it incompatible
with the office of a clergyman.

406
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:59,150
Several people, her Ladyship
included, have complimented me

407
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,950
on my lightness of foot.

408
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:32,250
Apparently, your Mr Wickham has
been called on some business to town.

409
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:39,650
Dancing is of little consequence
to me, but it does...

410
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:43,450
...but it does afford
the opportunity to lavish...

411
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:51,750
...upon one's partner attentions...
- My informer tells me...

412
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:57,050
...that he would be less inclined
to be engaged, were it not for...

413
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,550
...the presence
of a certain gentleman.

414
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,750
Which is my primary object.

415
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,750
That gentleman barely warrants the name.

416
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:07,850
It is my intention, if I may be so bold,

417
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,550
to remain close to you
throughout the evening.

418
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,350
May I have the next dance,
Miss Elizabeth?

419
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,450
You may.

420
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:43,650
- Did I agree to dance with Mr Darcy?
- I dare say you will find him amiable.

421
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:48,850
It would be most inconvenient since I've
sworn to loathe him for all eternity.

422
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:07,750
- I love this dance.
- Indeed. Most invigorating.

423
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,350
It is your turn to say something,
Mr Darcy.

424
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,350
I talked about the dance.

425
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:22,350
Now you ought to remark on the size
of the room or the number of couples.

426
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:26,550
I'm perfectly happy to oblige.
What would you like most to hear?

427
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:29,050
That reply will do for present.

428
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:34,550
Perhaps by and by I may observe

429
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:37,850
that private balls
are much pleasanter than public ones.

430
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:43,550
For now, we may remain silent.

431
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:54,350
Do you talk as a rule while dancing?

432
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,450
No. No, I prefer to be
unsociable and taciturn.

433
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,850
Makes it all so much more enjoyable,
don't you think?

434
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:12,050
Tell me, do you and your sisters
very often walk to Meryton?

435
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:18,250
Yes, we often walk to Meryton.

436
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,450
It's a great opportunity
to meet new people.

437
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:27,250
When you met us, we'd just had the
pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.

438
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:33,250
Mr Wickham's blessed with such happy
manners, he's sure of making friends.

439
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:36,250
Whether he's capable
of retaining them is less so.

440
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:42,050
He's been so unfortunate as to lose
your friendship. That is irreversible?

441
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:46,350
- It is. Why do you ask such a question?
- To make out your character.

442
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,150
- What have you discovered?
- Very little.

443
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:52,850
I hear such different accounts
of you as puzzle me exceedingly.

444
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,750
I hope to afford you more clarity
in the future.

445
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:46,250
- Is that Mr Darcy of Pemberley?
- I believe so.

446
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,350
I must make myself known to him.

447
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:51,350
He's a nephew of my patroness,
Lady Catherine.

448
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,550
He will consider it an impertinence.

449
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,250
Mr Darcy.

450
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,550
Mr Darcy.

451
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:05,250
Mr Darcy. Good evening...

452
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:08,450
What interesting relatives you have.

453
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:29,750
Mary, dear,
you've delighted us long enough.

454
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,250
Let the other young ladies have a turn.

455
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:39,050
... since I was a child,
and then she died.

456
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,950
I have a beautiful grey.

457
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:44,850
Of course, Caroline's
a much better rider than I, of course.

458
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:53,150
Oh, yes. We fully expect
a most advantageous marriage.

459
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:58,450
And my Jane, marrying so grand,
must throw her sisters in the way.

460
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:25,650
Clearly my family are seeing who can
expose themselves to the most ridicule.

461
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:29,850
- At least Bingley has not noticed.
- No.

462
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:33,550
- I think he likes her very much.
- But does she like him?

463
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:37,850
Few of us are secure enough to be
in love without proper encouragement.

464
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,350
Bingley likes her enormously,

465
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:43,250
but might not do more
if she does not help him on.

466
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:47,250
She's just shy. If he cannot
perceive her regard, he is a fool.

467
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,850
We are all fools in love.

468
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:53,050
He does not know
her character as we do.

469
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:55,650
She should move fast
and snap him up.

470
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:59,250
There is plenty of time
for us to get to know him afterwards.

471
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:04,350
I can't help feeling
that someone's going to produce a piglet

472
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,450
and make us chase it.

473
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:16,950
- Oh, dear!
- I do apologise, sir.

474
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:20,950
I'm awfully sorry. Do forgive me.

475
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,850
Emily, please!

476
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:48,650
Mary, my dear Mary.
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

477
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:52,050
- I've been practising all week.
- I know, my dear.

478
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:54,650
I hate balls.

479
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:15,950
Mr Bennet, wake up.

480
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:20,650
Oh, I've never had such a good time!

481
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,550
Charles, you cannot be serious.

482
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:38,050
We'll have a wedding here in less than
three months if you ask me, Mr Bennet.

483
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:42,550
Mr Bennet!

484
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:50,950
Mary, please.

485
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:01,350
Thank you, Mr Hill.

486
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:22,050
Mrs Bennet, I was hoping,
if it would not trouble you,

487
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:26,850
that I might solicit
a private audience with Miss Elizabeth.

488
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:32,750
Oh, certainly,
Lizzie would be very happy indeed.

489
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:37,250
Everyone, out. Mr Collins would like
a private audience with your sister.

490
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:41,850
Wait, Mr Collins can have nothing
to say to me that anybody need not hear.

491
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:46,050
I desire you will stay where you are.
Everyone else to the drawing room.

492
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:47,750
- Mr Bennet.
- But...

493
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:50,350
Now.

494
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:55,950
- Jane. Jane, don't... Jane!
- Jane.

495
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:01,850
Papa, stay.

496
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:30,050
Dear Miss Elizabeth,

497
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:33,750
My attentions have been
too marked to be mistaken.

498
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:36,450
Almost as soon
as I entered the house,

499
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:41,650
I singled you out
as the companion of my future life.

500
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:44,650
But before I am run away
with my feelings,

501
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:47,450
perhaps I may state
my reasons for marrying.

502
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:50,250
Firstly, that it is
the duty of a clergyman

503
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:53,050
to set the example
of matrimony in his parish.

504
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:57,150
Secondly, I am convinced
it will add greatly to my happiness.

505
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:00,250
And thirdly,
that it is at the urging

506
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:03,950
of my esteemed patroness,
Lady Catherine,

507
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:06,550
that I select a wife.

508
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,750
My object in coming to Longbourn
was to choose such a one

509
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:12,150
from among Mr Bennet's daughters,

510
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:15,150
for I am to inherit the estate

511
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:18,450
and such an alliance will surely...

512
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:21,650
...suit everyone.

513
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:28,150
And now nothing remains but for me to
assure you in the most animated language

514
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:30,950
- of the violence of my affections.
- Mr Collins!

515
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:33,350
And no reproach
on the subject of fortune

516
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:38,050
- will cross my lips once we're married.
- You forget I have given no answer.

517
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:41,850
Lady Catherine will
thoroughly approve when I speak to her

518
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:47,150
of your modesty, economy
and other amiable qualities.

519
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:52,050
Sir, I am honoured by your proposal,
but I regret that I must decline it.

520
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:57,050
I know ladies
don't seek to seem too eager...

521
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:01,050
Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious.
You could not make me happy.

522
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:04,850
And I'm the last woman
in the world who could make you happy.

523
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:09,550
I flatter myself that your refusal
is merely a natural delicacy.

524
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:12,650
Besides, despite manifold attractions,

525
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:17,050
it is by no means certain another offer
of marriage will ever be made to you.

526
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:20,850
I must conclude that you simply seek
to increase my love by suspense,

527
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:25,450
according to the usual practice
of elegant females.

528
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:29,250
I am not the sort of female
to torment a respectable man.

529
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,950
Please understand me,
I cannot accept you.

530
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:42,350
Headstrong, foolish child.

531
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:56,150
Don't worry, Mr Collins. We'll have this
little hiccup dealt with immediately.

532
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:00,950
Lizzie. Lizzie!

533
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:09,250
Mr Bennet, we're all in an uproar!

534
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:13,250
You must come
and make Lizzie marry Mr Collins.

535
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:15,850
Mr Collins has proposed to Lizzie,

536
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:19,550
but she vowed she will not have him,
and now the danger is

537
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:22,650
Mr Collins may not have Lizzie.

538
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:27,350
- What am I to do?
- Well, come and talk to her.

539
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:28,850
Now!

540
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:44,550
- Tell her you insist they marry.
- Papa, please.

541
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:48,750
You will have this house
and save your sisters from destitution.

542
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:51,950
- I can't marry him.
- Go and say you've changed your mind.

543
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,650
- Think of your family.
- You cannot make me.

544
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:57,350
Mr Bennet, say something.

545
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:04,550
Your mother insists
upon you marrying Mr Collins.

546
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:07,450
Yes, or I shall never see her again.

547
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:11,650
From this day onward, you must be
a stranger to one of your parents.

548
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:14,350
Who will maintain you
when your father is dead?

549
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:18,250
Your mother will never see you again
if you do not marry Mr Collins,

550
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:21,650
and I will never see you again
if you do.

551
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:23,550
Thank you, Papa.

552
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:31,850
Ungrateful child!
I shall never speak to you again.

553
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,850
Not that I take
much pleasure in talking.

554
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:38,550
People who suffer as I do
from nervous complaints

555
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:41,650
can have no pleasure
in talking to anybody.

556
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:43,650
Jane!

557
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:51,050
What's the matter? Jane?

558
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:48,950
I don't understand
what would take him from Netherfield.

559
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,450
Why does he not know when he'll return?

560
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:52,850
Read it.

561
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:06,550
"Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister
and we are scarcely less eager.

562
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,750
I do not think Georgiana Darcy
has her equal for beauty,

563
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:13,850
elegance and accomplishment.
I hope to call her hereafter my sister."

564
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:16,750
Is that not clear enough?

565
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:19,550
Caroline sees her brother
in love with you

566
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:22,550
and has taken him off
to persuade him otherwise.

567
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:27,550
But I know her to be incapable
of wilfully deceiving anyone.

568
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:32,350
- It's more likely he does not love me.
- He loves you. Do not give up.

569
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,750
Go to our aunt and uncle's in London,

570
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:40,450
let it be known you are there
and I am sure he will come to you.

571
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:54,650
Give my love to my sister
and try not to be a burden, dear.

572
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:57,350
Poor Jane.

573
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:01,850
Still, a girl likes to be
crossed in love now and then.

574
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:04,150
It gives her something to think of

575
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:07,450
and a sort of distinction
amongst her companions.

576
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:11,450
- I'm sure that will cheer her up, Papa.
- It's your turn now, Lizzie.

577
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,650
You've turned down Collins.

578
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:18,050
You're free to go off
and be jilted yourself.

579
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:20,150
What about Mr Wickham?

580
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:23,050
He's a pleasant fellow
and he'd do the job credibly.

581
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:26,850
- Father...
- And you have an affectionate mother

582
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:30,650
who would make the most of it.

583
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:52,350
- Charlotte!
- My dear Lizzie.

584
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:57,850
I've come her to tell you the news.
Mr Collins and I are... engaged.

585
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:00,450
- Engaged?
- Yes.

586
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:09,850
- To be married?
- What other kind of engaged is there?

587
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:14,650
For heaven's sake, Lizzie,
don't look at me like that.

588
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:17,950
I should be
as happy with him as any other.

589
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,850
- But he's ridiculous.
- Oh, hush.

590
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:24,750
Not all of us can afford to be romantic.

591
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:28,750
I've been offered
a comfortable home and protection.

592
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:30,750
There's a lot to be thankful for.

593
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:36,150
I'm 27 years old.
I've no money and no prospects.

594
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:40,050
I'm already a burden to my parents.

595
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,750
And I'm frightened.

596
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:47,350
So don’t judge me, Lizzie.
Don't you dare judge me.

597
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:42,850
<i>Dear Charlotte,
thank you for your letter.</i>

598
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:47,250
<i>I'm glad the house,
furniture and roads are to your taste,</i>

599
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:50,850
<i>and that Lady Catherine's behaviour
is friendly and obliging.</i>

600
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:53,750
<i>What with your departure,
Jane's to London</i>

601
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:57,350
<i>and the militia to the North
with the colourful Mr Wickham,</i>

602
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:01,450
<i>I must confess, the view
from where I sit has been rather grey.</i>

603
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:04,650
<i>As for the favour you ask,
it is no favour at all.</i>

604
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:08,850
<i>I would be happy to visit you
at your earliest convenience.</i>

605
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:17,650
Welcome to our humble abode.

606
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:26,750
My wife encourages me to spend time
in the garden for my health.

607
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:29,350
I think our guest is tired
after her journey.

608
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:34,050
I plan many improvements. I intend to
throw out a bough and plant a lime walk.

609
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:37,250
I flatter myself
that any young lady would be happy

610
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:40,450
to be the mistress of such a house.

611
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,550
We shan't be disturbed here.

612
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:47,550
This parlour is for
my own particular use.

613
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:54,250
Oh, Lizzie, it's such a pleasure
to run my own home.

614
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:57,550
- Charlotte, come here!
- What's happened?

615
00:57:57,950 --> 00:58:01,750
Has the pig escaped again?
Oh, it's Lady Catherine.

616
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:04,450
Come and see, Lizzie.

617
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:07,250
Great news.

618
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:10,550
We received an invitation to Rosings
from Lady Catherine.

619
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:12,450
How wonderful!

620
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:15,550
Do not make yourself uneasy
about your apparel.

621
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:18,050
Just put on the best you've brought.

622
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:22,650
Lady Catherine's never been averse
to the truly humble.

623
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:27,050
One of the most extraordinary
sights in all of Europe.

624
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:30,750
The glazing alone
costs upwards of Ј20,000.

625
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:33,550
Come along. Come along.

626
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:45,250
A little later we'll play cards.

627
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:49,050
Your Ladyship.

628
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:52,250
Miss de Bourgh.

629
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:14,050
- So, you are Elizabeth Bennet?
- I am, your Ladyship.

630
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:20,250
This is my daughter.

631
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:26,850
- It's kind of you to ask us to dine.
- The rug alone cost upwards of Ј300.

632
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:30,950
Mr Darcy.

633
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:34,350
What are you doing here?

634
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:39,950
Mr Darcy,
I had no idea we had the honour.

635
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:46,750
- Miss Elizabeth, I'm a guest here.
- You know my nephew?

636
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:51,950
I had the pleasure
of meeting your nephew in Hertfordshire.

637
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:54,850
Colonel Fitzwilliam. How do you do?

638
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:06,250
Mr Collins, you can't sit
next to your wife. Move. Over there.

639
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:26,450
Harvey, I wonder,
could you get me the fish course...

640
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:30,650
I trust your family is in good health,
Miss Elizabeth?

641
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:32,850
They are, thank you.

642
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:39,550
My eldest sister is in London.
Perhaps you saw her there.

643
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:41,750
I haven't been fortunate enough...

644
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:46,250
Do you play the pianoforte,
Miss Bennet?

645
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:50,950
- A little, ma'am, and very poorly.
- Do you draw?

646
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:54,350
No, not at all.

647
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,850
Your sisters, do they draw?

648
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:58,350
Not one.

649
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:00,050
That's very strange.

650
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:02,750
I suppose you had no opportunity.

651
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:06,750
Your mother should've taken you to town
for the benefit of the masters.

652
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:11,050
My mother wouldn't have minded,
but my father hates town.

653
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:14,750
- Has your governess left you?
- We never had a governess.

654
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:20,350
No governess? Five daughters
brought up at home without a governess?

655
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:24,650
I never heard such a thing. Your mother
must've been a slave to your education.

656
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:26,850
Not at all, Lady Catherine.

657
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:34,250
Your younger sisters,
are they out in society?

658
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:36,650
- Yes, ma'am, all.
- All?

659
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:39,750
What, all five out at once?
That's very odd.

660
01:01:40,050 --> 01:01:43,650
And you second. The younger ones
out before the elders are married?

661
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:47,350
Your youngest sisters
must be very young.

662
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:49,350
Yes, my youngest is not 16.

663
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:52,450
But it would be hard on younger sisters

664
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:56,150
not to have their amusement
because the elder is still unmarried.

665
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:59,350
It would hardly encourage
sisterly affection.

666
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:04,450
Upon my word, you give your opinion
very decidedly for so young a person.

667
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:07,450
Pray, what is your age?

668
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:11,450
With three younger sisters grown up,
you can hardly expect me to own to it.

669
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:23,750
Come, Miss Bennet, and play for us.

670
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:28,250
- No, I beg you.
- For music is my delight.

671
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:30,650
In fact,
there are few people in England

672
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:34,650
who have more true enjoyment of music.

673
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:36,550
Or better natural taste.

674
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:42,950
If I had ever learnt,
I should've been a great proficient.

675
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:47,350
So would Anne,
if her health would've allowed her.

676
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:51,750
I'm not afflicted with false
modesty, when I say I play poorly...

677
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:55,650
Come, Lizzie, her Ladyship demands it.

678
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:20,850
How does Georgiana get along, Darcy?

679
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:24,450
- She plays very well.
- I hope she practises.

680
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:27,850
No excellence can be acquired
without constant practice.

681
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:30,550
I've told Mrs Collins this.

682
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:34,150
Though you have no instrument,
you're welcome to come to Rosings

683
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:37,250
and play on the pianoforte
in the housekeeper's room.

684
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:41,350
You'll be in nobody's way
in that part of the house.

685
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:53,550
You mean to frighten me
by coming in all your state to hear me.

686
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:57,650
But I won't be alarmed,
even if your sister does play so well.

687
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:01,850
I know that I cannot alarm you
even should I wish it.

688
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:05,950
What was my friend like
in Hertfordshire?

689
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:09,150
You really care to know?

690
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:12,550
Prepare yourself
for something very dreadful.

691
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:15,750
The first time I saw him,
he danced with nobody,

692
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:17,550
though gentlemen were scarce

693
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:20,550
and there was more than
one lady without a partner.

694
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:24,350
- I knew nobody beyond my own party.
- Nobody can be introduced at a ball.

695
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:27,350
Fitzwilliam, I need you.

696
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:40,750
I do not have the talent

697
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:44,250
of conversing easily
with people I have never met before.

698
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:48,350
Perhaps you should take
your aunt's advice and practise.

699
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:12,150
<i>Dear Jane...</i>

700
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:25,550
Mr Darcy.

701
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:34,950
Please, do be seated.

702
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:43,350
Mr and Mrs Collins
have gone to the village.

703
01:05:51,350 --> 01:05:53,250
This is a charming house.

704
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:57,650
I believe my aunt did a great deal
to it when Mr Collins first arrived.

705
01:05:58,050 --> 01:06:00,350
I believe so.

706
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:06,650
She could not have bestowed
her kindness on a more grateful subject.

707
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:18,450
- Shall I call for some tea?
- No, thank you.

708
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:25,350
Good day, Miss Elizabeth,
it's been a pleasure.

709
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:35,350
What on earth have you done
to poor Mr Darcy?

710
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:37,950
I have no idea.

711
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:41,850
Every mind must have some counsellor

712
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:45,550
to whom it may apply
for consolation in distress.

713
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:50,550
There are many conveniences which
others can supply and we cannot procure.

714
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:52,750
I have in view those objects

715
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:55,950
which are only
to be obtained through intercourse...

716
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:03,450
Forgive me, through the intercourse
of friendship or civility.

717
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:09,350
On such occasions, the proud man steps
forth to meet you not with cordiality,

718
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:14,450
but with the suspicion of one
who reconnoitres an enemy...

719
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:18,350
- How long do you plan to stay?
- As long as Darcy chooses.

720
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:21,650
- I am at his disposal.
- Everyone appears to be.

721
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:25,650
I wonder he does not marry and secure
a lasting convenience of that kind.

722
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:29,550
- She would be a lucky woman.
- Really?

723
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:32,950
Darcy is a most loyal companion.

724
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:36,450
He recently came to the
rescue of one of his friends.

725
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:38,250
What happened?

726
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:40,450
He saved him
from an imprudent marriage.

727
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:41,850
Who's the man?

728
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:51,050
His closest friend, Charles Bingley.

729
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:56,450
Did Mr Darcy give a reason
for this interference?

730
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:59,850
There were apparently
strong objections to the lady.

731
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:03,250
What kind of objections?
Her lack of fortune?

732
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:07,650
I think it was her family
that was considered unsuitable.

733
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:13,850
- So he separated them?
- I believe so. I know nothing else.

734
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:45,850
Miss Elizabeth.

735
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:48,650
I have struggled in vain
and can bear it no longer.

736
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:52,950
These past months have been a torment.
I came to Rosings only to see you.

737
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:56,350
I have fought against
judgement, my family's expectation,

738
01:08:56,650 --> 01:08:59,350
the inferiority of your birth,
my rank.

739
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:02,250
I will put them aside
and ask you to end my agony.

740
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:05,550
- I don't understand.
- I love you.

741
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:10,050
Most ardently.

742
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:17,150
Please do me the honour
of accepting my hand.

743
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:22,450
Sir, I appreciate the struggle
you have been through,

744
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:25,250
and I am very sorry
to have caused you pain.

745
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:27,550
It was unconsciously done.

746
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:30,850
- Is this your reply?
- Yes, sir.

747
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:33,550
- Are you laughing at me?
- No.

748
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:35,050
Are you rejecting me?

749
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:40,550
I'm sure the feelings which hindered
your regard will help you overcome it.

750
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:43,950
Might I ask why with so little civility
I am thus repulsed?

751
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:49,350
I might enquire why you told me you
liked me against your better judgement?

752
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:51,950
If I was uncivil,
then that is some excuse.

753
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:55,050
- But you know I have other reasons.
- What reasons?

754
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:58,750
Do you think anything might tempt me
to accept the man who has ruined

755
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:02,150
the happiness of a most beloved sister?

756
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:06,950
Do you deny that you separated
a young couple who loved each other,

757
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:09,550
exposing your friend
to censure for caprice

758
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:12,550
and my sister to derision
for disappointed hopes,

759
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:14,850
involving them both in acute misery?

760
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:18,350
- I do not deny it.
- How could you do it?

761
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:21,450
I believed your sister
indifferent to him.

762
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:24,350
I realised his attachment
was deeper than hers.

763
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:25,550
She's shy!

764
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:28,350
Bingley was persuaded
she didn't feel strongly.

765
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:30,550
- You suggested it.
- For his own good.

766
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:33,550
My sister hardly shows
her true feelings to me.

767
01:10:37,950 --> 01:10:40,350
I suppose his fortune
had some bearing?

768
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:43,050
I wouldn't do your sister the dishonour.

769
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:45,250
- It was suggested...
- What was?

770
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:47,950
It was clear an advantageous marriage...

771
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:50,450
- Did my sister give that impression?
- No!

772
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:54,650
- No. There was, however, your family...
- Our want of connection?

773
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:57,350
- No, it was more than that.
- How, sir?

774
01:10:57,750 --> 01:11:02,350
The lack of propriety shown by your
mother, younger sisters and your father.

775
01:11:05,950 --> 01:11:10,750
Forgive me. You and your sister
I must exclude from this.

776
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:17,150
And what about Mr Wickham?

777
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:20,450
Mr Wickham?

778
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:23,350
What excuse can you
give for your behaviour?

779
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:26,650
- You take an eager interest.
- He told me of his misfortunes.

780
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:29,650
- Oh, they have been great.
- You ruin his chances

781
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:31,950
yet treat him with sarcasm.

782
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:34,250
So this is your opinion of me?

783
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:37,750
Thank you. Perhaps these offences
might have been overlooked

784
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:42,150
had not your pride been hurt
by my scruples about our relationship.

785
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:45,650
I am to rejoice in the inferiority
of your circumstances?

786
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:48,550
And those are the words of a gentleman.

787
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:53,350
Your arrogance and conceit, your selfish
disdain for the feelings of others

788
01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:59,150
made me realise you were the last man
in the world I could ever marry.

789
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:15,450
Forgive me, madam,
for taking up so much of your time.

790
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:21,850
I came to leave you this.

791
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:35,950
I shall not renew the sentiments
which were so disgusting to you.

792
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:40,350
But if I may, I will address the
two offences you have laid against me.

793
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:50,350
<i>My father loved Mr Wickham as a son.</i>

794
01:14:50,650 --> 01:14:54,250
<i>He left him a generous living.
But upon my father's death,</i>

795
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:59,050
<i>Mr Wickham announced
he had no intention of taking orders.</i>

796
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:04,950
<i>He demanded the value of the living,
which he'd gambled away within weeks.</i>

797
01:15:07,550 --> 01:15:10,550
<i>He then wrote,
demanding more money, which I refused.</i>

798
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:13,850
<i>After which,
he severed all acquaintance.</i>

799
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:18,350
<i>He came back to see us last summer, and
declared passionate love for my sister,</i>

800
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:22,550
<i>whom he tried to persuade
to elope with him.</i>

801
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:26,250
<i>She is to inherit Ј30,000.</i>

802
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:31,850
<i>When it was made clear he would never
receive a penny of it, he disappeared.</i>

803
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:35,750
<i>I will not attempt to convey the depth
of Georgiana's despair.</i>

804
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:39,050
<i>She was 15 years old.</i>

805
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:44,650
<i>As to the other matter,
of your sister and Mr Bingley,</i>

806
01:15:45,150 --> 01:15:48,450
<i>though the motives which governed me
may appear insufficient,</i>

807
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:51,950
<i>they were in the service of a friend.</i>

808
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:54,250
Lizzie.

809
01:15:57,550 --> 01:15:59,350
Are you all right?

810
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:02,850
I hardly know.

811
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:13,850
Lizzie. How fortunate you have arrived.

812
01:16:14,350 --> 01:16:17,850
Your aunt and uncle are here
to deliver Jane from London.

813
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:21,250
- How is Jane?
- She's in the drawing room.

814
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:29,950
I'm quite over him. If he passed me
in the street, I'd hardly notice.

815
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:34,050
London is so diverting. It's true.

816
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:38,550
There's so much to entertain.

817
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:46,250
What news from Kent?

818
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:50,050
Nothing.

819
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:53,950
At least not much to entertain.

820
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:55,950
Lizzie, tell Mama!

821
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:58,850
Stop making such a fuss.

822
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:02,750
- Why didn't she ask me as well?
- Because I'm better company.

823
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:05,650
- What's the matter?
- I've just as much right.

824
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:07,950
Let's all go.

825
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:11,050
Lydia's been invited to Brighton
with the Forsters.

826
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:13,350
Sea-bathing would set me up nicely.

827
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:15,750
I shall dine with the officers
every night.

828
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:17,950
Papa, don't let her go.

829
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:22,750
Lydia will never be easy until she's
exposed herself in some public place.

830
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:27,450
And we could never expect her
to do it with so little inconvenience.

831
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:29,850
If you do not check her,

832
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:34,650
she'll be fixed as the silliest flirt
who ever made her family ridiculous.

833
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:36,750
And Kitty will follow, as always.

834
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:41,650
Lizzie, we shall have no peace
until she goes.

835
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:45,250
Is that really all you care about?

836
01:17:45,550 --> 01:17:48,950
Colonel Forster is a sensible man.

837
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:52,050
He will keep her
out of any real mischief.

838
01:17:52,350 --> 01:17:55,050
And she's too poor
to be an object of prey to anyone.

839
01:17:55,350 --> 01:17:56,450
It's dangerous.

840
01:17:56,750 --> 01:18:01,050
I am certain the officers will find
women better worth their while.

841
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:06,050
Let us hope, in fact,
that her stay in Brighton

842
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:10,950
will teach her her own insignificance.

843
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:13,950
At any rate,
she can hardly grow any worse.

844
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:18,550
If she does, we'd be obliged to
lock her up for the rest of her life.

845
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:30,450
Lizzie, you're welcome to accompany us.

846
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:32,550
The Peak District is not Brighton.

847
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:36,250
Officers are thin on the ground
which may influence your decision.

848
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:40,550
Come to the Peak District with us,
Lizzie, and get some fresh air.

849
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:44,350
The glories of nature. What are men
compared to rocks and mountains?

850
01:18:44,650 --> 01:18:47,750
Men are either eaten up
with arrogance or stupidity.

851
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:51,250
If they are amiable,
they have no minds of their own.

852
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:54,650
Take care, my love.
That savours strongly of bitterness.

853
01:19:01,850 --> 01:19:05,850
I saw Mr Darcy when I was at Rosings.

854
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:07,750
Why did you not tell me?

855
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:12,850
Did he mention Mr Bingley?

856
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:16,450
No.

857
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:23,150
No, he did not.

858
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:30,350
Oh, what are men
compared to rocks and mountains?

859
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:34,050
Or carriages that work?

860
01:20:38,150 --> 01:20:40,550
Where exactly are we?

861
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:43,150
Quite close to Pemberley.

862
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:47,250
- Mr Darcy's home?
- That's the fellow.

863
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:51,150
Very well-stocked lake.
I've a hankering to see it.

864
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:52,450
Oh, no, let's not.

865
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:58,150
Well, he's so...

866
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:01,850
I'd rather not, he's so... he's so...

867
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:03,850
- So what?
- So rich.

868
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:07,050
By heavens, Lizzie,
what a snob you are!

869
01:21:07,450 --> 01:21:11,050
Objecting to Mr Darcy because of his
wealth. The poor man can't help it.

870
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:16,550
He won't be there anyway.
These great men are never at home.

871
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:22,450
Keep up.

872
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:46,550
- Is your master much at home?
- Not as much as I would wish.

873
01:22:46,850 --> 01:22:49,250
He dearly loves it here.

874
01:22:49,450 --> 01:22:53,050
If he should marry,
you might see more of him.

875
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:04,550
He's a lot like his father.

876
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:13,450
When my husband was ill,
Mr Darcy couldn't do enough.

877
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:21,850
He just organised the servants for me.

878
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:40,350
This is he, Mr Darcy.

879
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,850
A handsome face.

880
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:48,150
Lizzie, is it a true likeness?

881
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:51,850
Does the young lady
know Mr Darcy?

882
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:54,350
Only a little.

883
01:23:54,650 --> 01:23:58,550
Do you not think him
a handsome man, miss?

884
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:00,250
Yes.

885
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:05,050
Yes, I dare say he is.

886
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:11,450
This is his sister, Miss Georgiana.

887
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:15,550
She sings and plays all day long.

888
01:24:17,950 --> 01:24:20,350
Is she at home?

889
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:27,550
Miss Elizabeth.

890
01:26:38,850 --> 01:26:43,350
- I thought you were in London.
- No.

891
01:26:43,650 --> 01:26:45,850
No, I'm not.

892
01:26:46,150 --> 01:26:47,750
No.

893
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:51,250
- We would not have come...
- I came back a day early...

894
01:26:57,250 --> 01:26:58,550
I'm with my aunt and uncle.

895
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:03,350
And are you having a pleasant trip?

896
01:27:03,450 --> 01:27:05,950
Very pleasant.

897
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:09,750
- Tomorrow we go to Matlock.
- Tomorrow?

898
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:14,750
- Are you staying at Lambton?
- Yes, at the Rose and Crown.

899
01:27:15,050 --> 01:27:17,050
Yes.

900
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:22,450
I'm so sorry to intrude.

901
01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:26,550
They said the house was open
for visitors. I had no idea.

902
01:27:30,850 --> 01:27:33,050
- May I see you back to the village?
- No.

903
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:39,050
- I'm very fond of walking.
- Yes.

904
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:42,850
Yes, I know.

905
01:27:47,850 --> 01:27:50,050
Goodbye, Mr Darcy.

906
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:10,250
This way, sir.

907
01:28:16,350 --> 01:28:18,350
Are you sure you
wouldn't like to join us?

908
01:28:31,650 --> 01:28:34,950
We've just met Mr Darcy.
You didn't tell us that you'd seen him.

909
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:39,750
He's asked us to dine with him tomorrow.
He was very civil, was he not?

910
01:28:40,050 --> 01:28:42,550
- Very civil.
- Not at all how you'd painted him.

911
01:28:42,850 --> 01:28:44,050
To dine with him?

912
01:28:44,350 --> 01:28:48,550
There's something pleasant
about his mouth when he speaks.

913
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:51,750
You don't mind delaying
our journey another day?

914
01:28:51,950 --> 01:28:55,450
He particularly wants you
to meet his sister.

915
01:28:55,650 --> 01:28:57,350
His sister.

916
01:29:26,050 --> 01:29:27,950
Miss Elizabeth!

917
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:34,550
My sister, Miss Georgiana.

918
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:36,950
My brother has told me
so much about you,

919
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:40,050
- I feel as if we are friends already.
- Thank you.

920
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:43,550
- What a beautiful pianoforte.
- My brother gave it to me.

921
01:29:43,850 --> 01:29:45,750
- He shouldn't have.
- I should have.

922
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:49,150
- Very well then.
- Easily persuaded, is she not?

923
01:29:50,450 --> 01:29:53,250
He once had to put up with my playing.

924
01:29:53,450 --> 01:29:57,950
- He says you play so well.
- Then he has perjured himself.

925
01:29:58,350 --> 01:30:01,350
- I said "quite well".
- "Quite well" is not "very well".

926
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:03,250
I'm satisfied.

927
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:12,450
- Mr Gardiner, are you fond of fishing?
- Very much.

928
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:15,450
Would you accompany me
to the lake this afternoon?

929
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:18,150
Its occupants have been left
in peace too long.

930
01:30:18,450 --> 01:30:22,450
- I would be delighted.
- Do you play duets, Miss Elizabeth?

931
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:27,750
- Only when forced.
- Brother, you must force her.

932
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:31,750
Splendid fishing, good
company. What a capital fellow.

933
01:30:32,150 --> 01:30:35,050
Thank you so much, Mr Darcy.

934
01:30:37,150 --> 01:30:39,150
A letter for you, madam.

935
01:30:39,450 --> 01:30:41,250
Oh, it's from Jane.

936
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:07,950
It is the most dreadful news.

937
01:31:10,450 --> 01:31:12,550
Lydia has run away...

938
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:17,250
...with Mr Wickham.

939
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:19,350
They are gone to Lord knows where.

940
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:25,250
She has no money, no connections.
I fear she is lost forever.

941
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:30,850
This is my fault.

942
01:31:31,150 --> 01:31:34,550
If only I had exposed Wickham
when I should.

943
01:31:34,850 --> 01:31:37,750
No, this is my fault.

944
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:41,150
I might have prevented all this
by being open with my sisters.

945
01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:45,150
Has anything been done to recover her?

946
01:31:45,450 --> 01:31:50,350
My father has gone to London,
but I know nothing can be done.

947
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:55,250
We have not the smallest hope.

948
01:31:55,550 --> 01:31:57,350
Would I could help you.

949
01:31:57,550 --> 01:31:59,650
Sir, I think it is too late.

950
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:07,350
This is grave indeed.
I will leave you. Goodbye.

951
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:09,550
We must go at once.

952
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:13,450
I will join Mr Bennet and find Lydia
before she ruins the family.

953
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:45,950
Why did the Forsters
let her out of their sight?

954
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:49,350
I always said they were unfit
to take charge of her.

955
01:32:49,650 --> 01:32:52,750
- And now she is ruined.
- You are all ruined.

956
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:58,350
Who will take you now
with a fallen sister?

957
01:32:58,650 --> 01:33:02,050
Poor Mr Bennet will now have
to fight the perfidious Wickham

958
01:33:02,450 --> 01:33:03,950
and then be killed.

959
01:33:04,050 --> 01:33:05,850
He hasn't found him yet, Mama.

960
01:33:06,150 --> 01:33:08,850
Mr Collins will turn us out
before he is cold.

961
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:12,850
Do not be so alarmed. Our uncle
is in London helping in the search.

962
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:18,250
Lydia must know
what this must be doing to my nerves.

963
01:33:18,650 --> 01:33:23,650
Such flutterings
and spasms all over me!

964
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:29,450
My baby Lydia, my baby!

965
01:33:29,850 --> 01:33:34,150
How could she do such a thing
to her poor mama?

966
01:33:35,450 --> 01:33:37,850
- You can't do that!
- Don't be such a baby.

967
01:33:38,150 --> 01:33:40,650
- Kitty, give it to me.
- Who's it for?

968
01:33:40,950 --> 01:33:42,450
It's addressed to Papa.

969
01:33:44,150 --> 01:33:46,050
It's in Uncle's writing.

970
01:33:46,550 --> 01:33:48,950
Papa, there's a letter.

971
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:52,550
- Let me catch my breath.
- It's in Uncle's writing.

972
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:59,350
- He's found them.
- Are they married?

973
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:01,950
- I can't make out his script.
- Give it to me.

974
01:34:02,250 --> 01:34:03,450
Are they married?

975
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:08,050
They will be if Father settles Ј100
a year on her. That is his condition.

976
01:34:08,450 --> 01:34:11,150
- You will agree to this, Father?
- Of course.

977
01:34:11,450 --> 01:34:15,550
God knows how much your uncle
must've laid on that wretched man.

978
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:17,150
What do you mean?

979
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:19,050
No man would marry Lydia

980
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:23,350
under so slight
a temptation as Ј100 a year.

981
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:26,350
Your uncle must've been very generous.

982
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:29,550
Do you think it a large sum?

983
01:34:29,850 --> 01:34:32,850
Wickham's a fool if he
accepts less than Ј10,000.

984
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:35,950
- Heaven forbid!
- Father!

985
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:41,950
Lydia married and at 15 too!

986
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:44,050
Ring the bell, Kitty.

987
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:48,650
I must put on my things and tell
Lady Lucas. Oh, to see her face.

988
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:51,650
Tell the servants
they will have a bowl of punch.

989
01:34:51,950 --> 01:34:54,550
- We should thank our uncle.
- So he should help.

990
01:34:54,950 --> 01:34:58,350
He's far richer than us
and has no children. Daughter married!

991
01:34:58,550 --> 01:35:00,450
Is that really all you think about?

992
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:04,450
When you have five daughters, tell me
what else will occupy your thoughts.

993
01:35:04,850 --> 01:35:06,550
Then perhaps you'll understand.

994
01:35:07,950 --> 01:35:10,650
You don't know what he's like.

995
01:35:11,850 --> 01:35:14,350
- Lydia!
- Oh, Mama!

996
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:20,450
We passed Sarah Sims in her carriage.

997
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:24,350
So I took off my glove
so she might see the ring.

998
01:35:24,850 --> 01:35:27,550
Then I bowed and smiled
like anything...

999
01:35:27,850 --> 01:35:32,250
I'm sure she was not
half as radiant as you, my dear.

1000
01:35:32,650 --> 01:35:34,650
You must all go to Brighton.

1001
01:35:35,050 --> 01:35:38,450
That is the place to get husbands.
I hope you have half my good luck.

1002
01:35:38,850 --> 01:35:40,250
Lydia.

1003
01:35:40,450 --> 01:35:44,450
I want to hear
every little detail, Lydia, dear.

1004
01:35:44,850 --> 01:35:47,650
I've been enlisted
in a regiment in the North of England.

1005
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:49,450
Glad to hear it.

1006
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:52,850
Near Newcastle.
We travel there next week.

1007
01:35:53,150 --> 01:35:57,050
- Can I come and stay with you?
- That is out of the question.

1008
01:35:57,350 --> 01:36:00,050
Monday morning came
and I was in such a fuss.

1009
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:01,450
I don't want to hear.

1010
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:05,150
There was my aunt preaching away
as if reading a sermon.

1011
01:36:05,550 --> 01:36:09,050
- She was horrid unpleasant.
- Can't you understand why?

1012
01:36:09,450 --> 01:36:13,450
But I didn't hear a word because
I was thinking of my dear Wickham.

1013
01:36:13,850 --> 01:36:16,450
I longed to know if
he'd be married in his bluecoat.

1014
01:36:16,650 --> 01:36:21,050
The North of England, I believe,
boasts some spectacular scenery.

1015
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:25,050
So I thought, who is to be
our best man if he doesn't come back?

1016
01:36:25,450 --> 01:36:28,850
Lucky, he did,
or I would've had to ask Mr Darcy.

1017
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:33,350
- Mr Darcy!
- I forgot!

1018
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:36,950
- But I shouldn't have said a word.
- Mr Darcy was at your wedding?

1019
01:36:37,350 --> 01:36:40,150
He was the one that discovered us.

1020
01:36:40,450 --> 01:36:45,050
He paid for the wedding,
Wickham's commission, everything.

1021
01:36:45,450 --> 01:36:47,250
But he told me not to tell.

1022
01:36:48,450 --> 01:36:50,750
- Mr Darcy?
- Stop it, Lizzie.

1023
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:55,950
Mr Darcy's not half as high and mighty
as you sometimes.

1024
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:04,750
Kitty, have you seen my ring?

1025
01:37:05,050 --> 01:37:07,050
Write to me often, my dear.

1026
01:37:07,350 --> 01:37:10,350
Married women
never have much time for writing.

1027
01:37:10,550 --> 01:37:12,350
I dare say you won't.

1028
01:37:12,650 --> 01:37:17,450
When I married your father, there didn't
seem to be enough hours in the day.

1029
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:24,050
My sisters may write to me,
for they'll have nothing else to do.

1030
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:35,250
There's nothing so bad
as parting with one's children.

1031
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:40,050
One seems so forlorn without them.

1032
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:49,550
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Lydia. Goodbye, Mr Wickham.

1033
01:37:51,450 --> 01:37:53,950
Bye, Kitty. Bye, Papa.

1034
01:37:59,950 --> 01:38:02,950
I can't imagine what your
father does with all that ink.

1035
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:05,150
Mrs Bennet.

1036
01:38:06,250 --> 01:38:10,750
Did you hear the news, madam?
Mr Bingley is returning to Netherfield.

1037
01:38:11,150 --> 01:38:15,150
Mrs Nichols is ordering a haunch
of pork. She expects him tomorrow.

1038
01:38:15,450 --> 01:38:17,750
Tomorrow?

1039
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:20,450
Not that I care.
Mr Bingley's nothing to us.

1040
01:38:20,850 --> 01:38:23,950
I'm sure I never want
to see him again, no.

1041
01:38:24,150 --> 01:38:28,350
We shan't mention a word about it.
Is it quite certain he's coming?

1042
01:38:28,750 --> 01:38:33,450
Yes, madam. I believe he's alone.
His sister remains in town.

1043
01:38:35,650 --> 01:38:40,450
Why he thinks we should be interested,
I've no idea. Come along, girls.

1044
01:38:41,550 --> 01:38:45,650
We better go home at once
and tell Mr Bennet.

1045
01:38:46,050 --> 01:38:49,750
The impudence of the man.
I wonder he dare show his face.

1046
01:38:50,150 --> 01:38:52,150
It's all right, Lizzie.

1047
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:55,250
I'm just glad he's alone
because we shall see less of him.

1048
01:38:55,550 --> 01:38:59,650
Not that I'm afraid of myself.
But I dread other people's remarks.

1049
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:01,550
Oh, I'm sorry.

1050
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:38,250
He's here. He's here. He's at the door.

1051
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:42,350
- Mr Bingley!
- Mr Bingley?

1052
01:39:42,650 --> 01:39:45,450
Oh, my goodness!
Everybody behave naturally.

1053
01:39:45,950 --> 01:39:48,450
And whatever you do,
do not appear overbearing.

1054
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:52,150
There's someone with him.
Mr Whatsisname, the pompous one.

1055
01:39:52,450 --> 01:39:56,850
Mr Darcy? The insolence of
it. What does he think of, coming here?

1056
01:39:57,250 --> 01:40:01,950
Keep still, Jane. Mary, put that away at
once. Find some useful employment.

1057
01:40:03,550 --> 01:40:07,050
Oh, my Lord, I shall have a seizure,
I'm sure I shall.

1058
01:40:07,450 --> 01:40:09,350
Kitty.

1059
01:40:09,450 --> 01:40:13,550
- We can't have this here.
- Mary, the ribbons, the ribbons.

1060
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:19,850
Mary, sit down at once. Mary!

1061
01:40:23,650 --> 01:40:27,950
Mr Darcy and Mr Bingley, ma'am.

1062
01:40:39,050 --> 01:40:41,650
How glad we are
to see you, Mr Bingley.

1063
01:40:41,950 --> 01:40:44,450
There have been
many changes since you went away.

1064
01:40:44,750 --> 01:40:49,450
Miss Lucas is married and settled.
And one of my own daughters too.

1065
01:40:49,850 --> 01:40:51,650
You will have seen it in the papers,

1066
01:40:51,950 --> 01:40:54,350
though it was not put in
as it ought to have been.

1067
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:58,250
Very short. Nothing about her family.

1068
01:40:58,550 --> 01:41:01,250
Yes, I did hear of it.
I offer my congratulations.

1069
01:41:01,550 --> 01:41:04,850
But it is very hard
to have my Lydia taken away from me.

1070
01:41:05,150 --> 01:41:09,050
Mr Wickham has been transferred
to Newcastle, wherever that is.

1071
01:41:09,350 --> 01:41:11,150
Will you stay long in the country?

1072
01:41:11,450 --> 01:41:13,550
Just a few weeks. For the shooting.

1073
01:41:13,950 --> 01:41:15,850
When you've killed all your own birds,

1074
01:41:16,150 --> 01:41:19,050
I beg you will come here
and shoot as many as you please.

1075
01:41:19,350 --> 01:41:23,650
Mr Bennet will be vastly happy to oblige
and will save the best coveys for you.

1076
01:41:24,150 --> 01:41:26,450
Excellent.

1077
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:30,450
- Are you well, Mr Darcy?
- Quite well, thank you.

1078
01:41:30,850 --> 01:41:33,150
I hope the weather stays fine
for your sport.

1079
01:41:33,350 --> 01:41:36,750
- I return to town tomorrow.
- So soon?

1080
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:42,850
My Jane looks well, does she not?

1081
01:41:44,950 --> 01:41:46,950
She does indeed.

1082
01:41:54,350 --> 01:41:57,050
Well, we must be going, I think.

1083
01:41:57,950 --> 01:42:01,450
Darcy. It's been very pleasant
to see you all again.

1084
01:42:01,750 --> 01:42:03,550
Miss Elizabeth. Miss Bennet.

1085
01:42:03,950 --> 01:42:05,250
You must come again.

1086
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:08,850
Last winter, you promised to have
a family dinner with us.

1087
01:42:09,150 --> 01:42:13,750
I've not forgot, you see.
At least three courses.

1088
01:42:19,850 --> 01:42:21,450
Excuse me.

1089
01:42:27,350 --> 01:42:30,050
Most extraordinary.

1090
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:44,550
We were going to walk in
and she was going to say, "Sit down."

1091
01:42:44,850 --> 01:42:46,850
So, I feel...

1092
01:42:57,350 --> 01:42:59,050
Oh, it's a disaster, isn't it?

1093
01:42:59,450 --> 01:43:01,250
It's been...

1094
01:43:03,850 --> 01:43:05,850
- Miss Bennet.
- Mr Bingley.

1095
01:43:06,150 --> 01:43:08,850
I'll just go in and I'll just say it.

1096
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:11,350
Yes, exactly.

1097
01:43:16,150 --> 01:43:19,650
I'm glad that's over. Now we can
meet as indifferent acquaintances.

1098
01:43:19,950 --> 01:43:20,950
Oh, yes.

1099
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:24,150
You cannot think me so weak
as to be in danger now.

1100
01:43:24,450 --> 01:43:28,150
You are in great danger of making
him as much in love with you as ever.

1101
01:43:30,150 --> 01:43:34,550
- I'm sorry he came with Mr Darcy.
- Don't say that.

1102
01:43:36,050 --> 01:43:37,050
Why ever not?

1103
01:43:39,950 --> 01:43:42,950
Jane.

1104
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:47,850
- I've been so blind.
- What do you mean?

1105
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:50,950
Look, it's him.
He's back. He's come again.

1106
01:43:59,450 --> 01:44:01,350
I know this is all very untoward,

1107
01:44:01,650 --> 01:44:05,650
but I would like to request the
privilege of speaking to Miss Bennet.

1108
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:09,050
Alone.

1109
01:44:10,750 --> 01:44:13,850
Everybody to the kitchen immediately.

1110
01:44:14,150 --> 01:44:18,050
Except you, Jane, dear, of course.

1111
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:24,950
Oh, Mr Bingley, it's so good
to see you again so soon.

1112
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:49,850
First, I must tell you I've been the
most unmitigated and comprehensive ass.

1113
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:09,950
Kitty, be quiet.

1114
01:45:22,450 --> 01:45:24,850
Yes.

1115
01:45:25,050 --> 01:45:27,250
A thousand times yes.

1116
01:45:32,750 --> 01:45:36,050
Thank the Lord for that.
I thought it would never happen.

1117
01:46:22,550 --> 01:46:26,650
I am confident
they will do well together.

1118
01:46:27,050 --> 01:46:30,850
Their tempers are much alike.

1119
01:46:32,150 --> 01:46:35,850
They will be cheated assiduously
by their servants.

1120
01:46:36,350 --> 01:46:42,250
And be so generous with the rest,
they will always exceed their income.

1121
01:46:42,750 --> 01:46:47,050
Exceed their income?
He has 5,000 a year.

1122
01:46:51,150 --> 01:46:54,550
I knew she did not be
so beautiful for nothing.

1123
01:47:03,050 --> 01:47:05,450
"...must be free from all insincerity.

1124
01:47:05,750 --> 01:47:09,250
She only can address herself effectually
to the feelings of others

1125
01:47:09,650 --> 01:47:12,750
whose mind glows
with the warmth of sensibility

1126
01:47:13,050 --> 01:47:15,650
and whose arguments result
from conviction.

1127
01:47:15,950 --> 01:47:19,250
She must feel the influence
of those passions and emotions

1128
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:22,750
which she wishes to inspire..."

1129
01:47:43,550 --> 01:47:45,750
Can you die of happiness?

1130
01:47:47,450 --> 01:47:50,350
He was ignorant
of my being in town in the spring.

1131
01:47:50,650 --> 01:47:53,550
- How did he account for it?
- He thought me indifferent.

1132
01:47:53,950 --> 01:47:57,550
- Unfathomable.
- No doubt poisoned by his sister.

1133
01:47:57,850 --> 01:48:03,150
Bravo. That's the most
unforgiving speech you've ever made.

1134
01:48:03,650 --> 01:48:05,750
Oh, Lizzie, if I could
but see you so happy.

1135
01:48:06,050 --> 01:48:08,250
If there was such a man for you.

1136
01:48:12,050 --> 01:48:15,150
Perhaps Mr Collins has a cousin.

1137
01:48:18,150 --> 01:48:19,850
- What is that?
- What?

1138
01:48:20,050 --> 01:48:23,050
Maybe he's changed his mind.

1139
01:48:25,450 --> 01:48:27,450
Coming!

1140
01:48:30,650 --> 01:48:31,950
Yes.

1141
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:35,950
Lady Catherine.

1142
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:44,550
The rest of your offspring, I presume?

1143
01:48:44,850 --> 01:48:48,450
All but one. The youngest
has been lately married, your Ladyship.

1144
01:48:48,750 --> 01:48:51,550
My eldest was proposed to
only this afternoon.

1145
01:48:53,550 --> 01:48:57,450
- You have a very small garden.
- Could I offer you a cup of tea?

1146
01:48:57,750 --> 01:49:01,050
Absolutely not. I need to speak
to Miss Elizabeth Bennet alone.

1147
01:49:02,050 --> 01:49:04,150
As a matter of urgency.

1148
01:49:08,150 --> 01:49:11,350
You can be at no loss
to understand why I am here.

1149
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:13,950
I cannot account for this honour at all.

1150
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:18,250
I warn you, I am not to be trifled with.

1151
01:49:18,550 --> 01:49:20,850
A most alarming report
has reached me.

1152
01:49:21,050 --> 01:49:25,450
That you intend to be united
with my nephew, Mr Darcy.

1153
01:49:25,850 --> 01:49:29,250
I know this to be a falsehood.
Though not wishing to injure him

1154
01:49:29,650 --> 01:49:33,350
by supposing it possible, I instantly
set off to make my sentiments known.

1155
01:49:33,750 --> 01:49:36,750
If you believed it impossible,
I wonder that you came so far.

1156
01:49:37,050 --> 01:49:38,250
To hear it contradicted.

1157
01:49:38,550 --> 01:49:41,850
Your coming will be a confirmation
if such a report exists.

1158
01:49:42,150 --> 01:49:45,250
lf? You pretend to be ignorant of it?

1159
01:49:45,550 --> 01:49:48,350
Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourself?

1160
01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:50,550
I have never heard of it.

1161
01:49:50,850 --> 01:49:53,150
Can you declare
there is no foundation for it?

1162
01:49:53,450 --> 01:49:56,750
I do not pretend to possess
equal frankness with your Ladyship.

1163
01:49:57,050 --> 01:50:00,050
You may ask a question
which I may choose not to answer.

1164
01:50:00,450 --> 01:50:02,650
Has my nephew
made you an offer of marriage?

1165
01:50:02,750 --> 01:50:05,750
Your Ladyship has declared it
to be impossible.

1166
01:50:06,150 --> 01:50:09,550
Mr Darcy is engaged to my daughter.
Now what have you to say?

1167
01:50:09,850 --> 01:50:13,350
If that is the case, you cannot suppose
he would make an offer to me.

1168
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:18,650
Selfish girl. This union
has been planned since their infancy.

1169
01:50:19,050 --> 01:50:22,250
Do you think it can be prevented
by a woman of inferior birth

1170
01:50:22,650 --> 01:50:26,950
whose own sister's elopement resulted
in a scandalously patched-up marriage

1171
01:50:27,350 --> 01:50:30,450
only achieved
at the expense of your uncle.

1172
01:50:30,750 --> 01:50:34,450
Heaven and Earth! Are the shades
of Pemberley to be thus polluted?

1173
01:50:34,850 --> 01:50:37,250
Tell me once and for all,
are you engaged to him?

1174
01:50:40,850 --> 01:50:42,950
I am not.

1175
01:50:43,850 --> 01:50:46,750
Will you promise never
to enter into such an engagement?

1176
01:50:47,050 --> 01:50:49,150
I will not and I certainly never shall.

1177
01:50:51,150 --> 01:50:53,250
You have insulted me
in every possible way

1178
01:50:53,650 --> 01:50:56,250
and can now have
nothing further to say.

1179
01:50:57,650 --> 01:51:00,250
I must ask you to leave immediately.

1180
01:51:02,650 --> 01:51:03,950
Goodnight.

1181
01:51:05,950 --> 01:51:09,550
I have never been thus treated
in my entire life!

1182
01:51:10,950 --> 01:51:14,250
- What is going on?
- Just a small misunderstanding.

1183
01:51:14,650 --> 01:51:17,750
For once in your life,
leave me alone!

1184
01:54:07,450 --> 01:54:10,150
- I couldn't sleep.
- Nor I. My aunt...

1185
01:54:10,450 --> 01:54:13,450
Yes, she was here.

1186
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:16,750
How can I ever make amends
for such behaviour?

1187
01:54:17,150 --> 01:54:19,450
After what you've done for Lydia

1188
01:54:19,750 --> 01:54:22,850
and, I suspect, for Jane,
it is I who should be making amends.

1189
01:54:24,350 --> 01:54:28,950
You must know.
Surely you must know it was all for you.

1190
01:54:31,650 --> 01:54:34,650
You are too generous to trifle with me.

1191
01:54:34,950 --> 01:54:38,250
You spoke with my aunt last night
and it has taught me to hope

1192
01:54:38,450 --> 01:54:41,050
as I'd scarcely allowed myself before.

1193
01:54:42,650 --> 01:54:47,550
If your feelings are still what they
were last April, tell me so at once.

1194
01:54:47,850 --> 01:54:50,750
My affections and wishes
have not changed.

1195
01:54:51,150 --> 01:54:54,150
But one word from you
will silence me for ever.

1196
01:54:59,550 --> 01:55:03,650
lf, however,
your feelings have changed...

1197
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:08,750
...I would have to tell you,

1198
01:55:09,050 --> 01:55:11,750
you have bewitched me,
body and soul, and I love...

1199
01:55:12,050 --> 01:55:14,950
I love... I love you.

1200
01:55:15,250 --> 01:55:18,050
I never wish to be parted
from you from this day on.

1201
01:55:29,850 --> 01:55:31,450
Well, then.

1202
01:55:36,550 --> 01:55:39,050
Your hands are cold.

1203
01:56:23,550 --> 01:56:25,350
Shut the door, please.

1204
01:56:36,450 --> 01:56:41,750
Lizzie, are you out of your senses?
I thought you hated the man.

1205
01:56:42,150 --> 01:56:46,950
- No, Papa.
- He is rich, to be sure.

1206
01:56:47,350 --> 01:56:51,050
And you will have
more fine carriages than Jane.

1207
01:56:51,350 --> 01:56:53,750
But will that make you happy?

1208
01:56:54,050 --> 01:56:57,950
Have you no other objection
than your belief in my indifference?

1209
01:56:58,350 --> 01:57:00,450
None at all.

1210
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:05,350
We all know him to be
a proud, unpleasant sort of fellow.

1211
01:57:05,750 --> 01:57:08,050
But this would be nothing
if you liked him.

1212
01:57:08,350 --> 01:57:09,950
I do like him.

1213
01:57:12,350 --> 01:57:13,850
I love him.

1214
01:57:17,050 --> 01:57:21,550
He's not proud. I was wrong.
I was entirely wrong about him.

1215
01:57:25,250 --> 01:57:28,450
You don't know him, Papa.
If I told you what he was really like,

1216
01:57:28,750 --> 01:57:29,850
what he's done...

1217
01:57:30,950 --> 01:57:32,850
What has he done?

1218
01:57:41,050 --> 01:57:44,650
But she doesn't like him.
I thought she didn't like him.

1219
01:57:45,050 --> 01:57:48,550
So did I. So did we all.

1220
01:57:48,850 --> 01:57:51,350
We must have been wrong.

1221
01:57:51,750 --> 01:57:57,050
- It won't be the first time, will it?
- No, nor the last, I dare say.

1222
01:58:02,750 --> 01:58:04,450
Good Lord.

1223
01:58:07,250 --> 01:58:11,050
- I must pay him back.
- No.

1224
01:58:11,450 --> 01:58:14,850
You mustn't tell anyone.
He wouldn't want it.

1225
01:58:15,150 --> 01:58:19,250
We misjudged him, Papa.
Me more than anyone. In every way.

1226
01:58:19,750 --> 01:58:22,850
Not just in this matter.

1227
01:58:23,150 --> 01:58:25,750
I've been nonsensical.

1228
01:58:26,050 --> 01:58:30,850
But he's been a fool about Jane,
about so many other things.

1229
01:58:31,250 --> 01:58:34,550
But then, so have I.

1230
01:58:37,550 --> 01:58:40,150
You see, he and I are...

1231
01:58:42,550 --> 01:58:45,550
He and I are so similar.

1232
01:58:45,950 --> 01:58:49,150
We're both so stubborn.

1233
01:58:50,950 --> 01:58:52,550
Papa, I...

1234
01:58:56,650 --> 01:58:58,850
You really do love him, don't you?

1235
01:59:00,450 --> 01:59:02,650
Very much.

1236
01:59:07,150 --> 01:59:12,650
I cannot believe
that anyone can deserve you.

1237
01:59:13,150 --> 01:59:17,150
But it seems I am overruled.

1238
01:59:17,550 --> 01:59:21,950
So I heartily give my consent.

1239
01:59:30,450 --> 01:59:35,150
I could not have parted with you,
my Lizzie, to anyone less worthy.

1240
01:59:38,650 --> 01:59:39,650
Thank you.

1241
01:59:53,750 --> 01:59:58,150
If any young men come for Mary or Kitty,
for heaven's sake, send them in.

1242
01:59:58,650 --> 02:00:01,050
I'm quite at my leisure.

1243
02:00:23,240 --> 02:00:23,240
How are you this
evening, my dear?

1244
02:00:25,142 --> 02:00:25,142
Very well.

1245
02:00:26,510 --> 02:00:26,510
Only I wish you would not
call me 'my dear.'

1246
02:00:28,145 --> 02:00:28,145
Why?

1247
02:00:29,213 --> 02:00:29,213
'Cause it's what my father
always calls my mother

1248
02:00:31,281 --> 02:00:31,281
when he's cross
about something .

1249
02:00:32,716 --> 02:00:32,716
What endearments
am I allowed?

1250
02:00:34,184 --> 02:00:35,628
Well, let me think.

1251
02:00:35,853 --> 02:00:37,491
Lizzie, for everyday.

1252
02:00:38,222 --> 02:00:40,702
My pearl, for Sundays .

1253
02:00:41,558 --> 02:00:44,698
And Goddess Divine, but only on very
special occasions.

1254
02:00:46,163 --> 02:00:49,200
And what shall I call you
when I'm cross?

1255
02:00:50,567 --> 02:00:50,567
Mrs. Darcy?

1256
02:00:51,969 --> 02:00:54,176
No. No.

1257
02:00:55,239 --> 02:00:57,343
You may only call me
Mrs. Darcy

1258
02:00:58,375 --> 02:01:00,377
when you are completely

1259
02:01:00,577 --> 02:01:03,683
and perfectly,
and incandescently happy.

1260
02:01:07,217 --> 02:01:11,028
And how are you this evening,
Mrs. Darcy?

1261
02:01:20,431 --> 02:01:21,875
Mrs. Darcy.

1262
02:01:25,068 --> 02:01:26,672
Mrs. Darcy.

1263
02:01:28,705 --> 02:01:29,979
Mrs. Darcy.

1264
02:01:35,779 --> 02:01:36,950
Mrs. Darcy.

1265
02:01:37,305 --> 02:02:37,534
