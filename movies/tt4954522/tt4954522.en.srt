2
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:53,508
Hi. Can I have some
mashed potatoes, please?

3
00:02:58,137 --> 00:02:59,430
No protein?

4
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:01,516
No thanks. No meat.

5
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:08,815
Mm-mm.

6
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:10,775
What?

7
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,944
What's wrong?

8
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,779
Spit it out.

9
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:20,159
Shit.

10
00:03:20,285 --> 00:03:21,911
Did you bite into it?
No.

11
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:24,038
Sure?
Look. No.

12
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:25,832
This shit
really gets me.

13
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:27,834
Mom, it's fine.
Forget it.

14
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,794
Seriously?
And if you were allergic?

15
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,471
You want mine?

16
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,307
No, thanks.

17
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:44,809
My daughter had meat.

18
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:47,478
It's unacceptable.
We're vegetarians.

19
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:42,450
Wow, it looks
shabbier.

20
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:43,868
Don't you think?

21
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:54,879
Is that it?

22
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,465
No, that's
the med faculty.

23
00:04:57,548 --> 00:05:00,593
Hospital on the left,
morgue next to it.

24
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,429
And the grocery
store, look.

25
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,556
I'm already lost.

26
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:23,616
You have your phone?
Yeah.

27
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,244
Call your sister.
She may answer for you.

28
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,211
I'm going.
She won't come.

29
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:38,172
Are you nuts?
We're not leaving Juju on her own!

30
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:40,258
She said she'd
pick her up.

31
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,844
Wait a bit,
she may come.

32
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:44,137
So, brainiac,

33
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:48,099
show' em what you can do.

34
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,767
OK? See you.

35
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,147
I love you, baby.

36
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:56,524
Call me.
Yeah.

37
00:05:57,108 --> 00:06:00,445
Love you too, Mommy.

38
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:42,695
What's that shit music?

39
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,821
Beats me. Who are you?

40
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:45,490
Roommate. I got
here late. Up!

41
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:47,742
You're not a girl.

42
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:48,910
Nope.

43
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,620
I asked for a girl.

44
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:52,872
They gave you a fag,
same deal for them.

45
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:54,040
Here, take this.

46
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:55,833
What's going on?
What's this?

47
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:57,502
A ski pole.

48
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,355
That's my shit!

49
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,402
Hey! Where
are you going?

50
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:24,529
Where?

51
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:25,988
Bed, man.

52
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:28,866
Bed? Where? Your bed's
downstairs, friend.

53
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:32,912
Check it. This one
wants out already!

54
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:35,706
You got in to please
your parents, right?

55
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:36,999
I thought it was over.

56
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,168
You'll know if
it's over, big guy.

57
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:40,336
Get back in line.

58
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,462
Get in line.

59
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:44,382
And now, where
are we headed?

60
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,717
Where?

61
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:49,637
- To freedom!
- Fuck off!

62
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,305
Fuckers!

63
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:54,433
Speed it up, rookies!

64
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:56,102
Assholes.

65
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:59,605
Get up! Move your asses!
Hurry, the boss is waiting.

66
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:02,733
- Move it!
- Come on, guys.

67
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,404
Faster, rookies!

68
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:12,660
Move down!

69
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,590
Move your asses!

70
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,133
You! You stay put.

71
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:29,177
Go. Go. Move it.
Move it.

72
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:30,678
Rookies, move it!

73
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:34,015
Get moving, go, go!

74
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:29,570
Hey, it's just a game.
What do you think could happen?

75
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,199
I'm Adrien.

76
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:35,076
Justine.

77
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:01,852
Slut it up, girls.

78
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,187
You're the slut.

79
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:19,930
Alex!

80
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:36,655
Alex!

81
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:44,622
I'm so wasted.

82
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:47,958
Where were you?
Mom and Dad will kill you.

83
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:49,710
It's so cool you're here.

84
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:53,089
You'll love it. The
first year is the best.

85
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:56,717
And we'll see each other
all the time, like at home.

86
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:00,221
Is my thong
out of my shorts?

87
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:02,515
You're fine.

88
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:09,271
Mom got to you, I see.
Was it hell without me?

89
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:10,564
What do you mean?

90
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:14,819
Fuck.

91
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:16,904
I need some fresh air.

92
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:18,989
Quicky!

93
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:20,991
Long time, no see!

94
00:12:49,437 --> 00:12:53,190
- Where's the light?
- Don't. We're not allowed in here.

95
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:56,694
Where are we?

96
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:02,199
Alex?

97
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,247
Where do I go now?

98
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,541
Fuck, bumped my eye!

99
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,468
Where are you? Ugh.

100
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:28,934
Stop it!

101
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,060
Look.

102
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,531
Some heads are cut off.

103
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:45,075
Traitors. They
refused initiation.

104
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,669
Here it is, come look.

105
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:03,260
Who's that?

106
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:08,140
No way.
They wouldn't do that kind of thing.

107
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:10,434
It's tradition.
You will too, right.

108
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:11,560
Really?

109
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:14,813
- Don't be a wimp.
- Even Mom looks happy.

110
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:18,275
Poor Dad, it's all over him.
You can't see his face.

111
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,278
Are you cold?

112
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:24,114
I'm going back to dance.
Watch Quicky?

113
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:26,367
I'm going to bed,
I'm dead.

114
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,743
No way!

115
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,538
Why? Rookies don't
go to bed before us.

116
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:02,319
Shh! My roommate's
sleeping. Come with me.

117
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:06,490
Wait.

118
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,170
Ketamine.

119
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:03,047
Let's try it.

120
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:08,719
Move it up.

121
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,267
OK. Take the brace.

122
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,948
A student for the strut,
a cushion for the head.

123
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,795
<i>Vets, they march ahead</i>

124
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,130
<i>Their dicks up
proud in the air</i>

125
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:49,677
<i>Cuz a vet will
fuck you anywhere</i>

126
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:54,264
<i>They are men - yes sir!
With giant balls, for her</i>

127
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,600
<i>They like a laugh,
they like a drink</i>

128
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:58,227
<i>They like to screw
and we do too!</i>

129
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,271
<i>Oh yes, they do, and we do too</i>

130
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:26,439
71st graduating class St. Expuery
School of Veterinary Medicine

131
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:27,464
September 2015

132
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:28,632
Conscripts!

133
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:33,178
You have made it to our great school.
We applaud you.

134
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,889
Your profs will make you
the best vets out there.

135
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:38,726
Your elders will
make you family.

136
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:43,021
But first you must learn.

137
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:48,402
Learn to be a team,
to obey, to be good rookies.

138
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:53,824
From now on, you will call your elders
either 'elders' or 'great ones.'

139
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,743
Repeat after me: Elders.

140
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:57,911
Elders.
Hey! Elders.

141
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:59,037
Elders.

142
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:00,330
Good. And great ones.

143
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:01,457
Great ones.

144
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,834
What a nice
bunch this year. Where was I?

145
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,004
They'll help you
during your rush week,

146
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,673
which will end
when you hear this:

147
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:12,509
For real?

148
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:15,137
When you hear. Yeah.

149
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:19,975
Then and only then
are you no longer rookies.

150
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:22,478
In the meantime,
we're counting on you.

151
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,730
Make us proud.
We'll show you the way.

152
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:25,856
Vets!

153
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:35,115
Longest wait
ever for an open bar.

154
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:36,241
What is it?

155
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,367
Wait your turn.

156
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:38,494
Is it meat?

157
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:40,037
Rabbit kidney.
Better not to know.

158
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:43,081
I'm a vegetarian,
I can't eat that.

159
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,417
Ask my sister,
our family's veggie.

160
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,669
Who's your sister?
Alexia.

161
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:48,796
No shit.

162
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:53,091
Alex? Come here a sec.
Huh?

163
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:54,718
You vegetarian?
No. Why?

164
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,136
She your sister?

165
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:59,056
Call my parents if
you don't trust me.

166
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:02,226
Are you serious? It's nothing.
Everybody does it.

167
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:03,560
So eat hers then.

168
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:04,812
I ate
mine last year.

169
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:06,230
That's why I'm here now.

170
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,940
Go on, eat it.

171
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:20,911
See? Easy.

172
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,584
Open up.

173
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,587
You'll be happy
you did it.

174
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:36,677
Don't start the year by chickening out.
They're watching.

175
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:04,788
Maybe not all animals,
but monkeys.

176
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:06,957
It comes from them.

177
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,127
Do you think a monkey
can get AIDS today?

178
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,379
If you treat a monkey

179
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,381
in a zoo
or African reserve,

180
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,259
are you as careful as a doctor
doing normal surgery?

181
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:20,762
No clue. Why are you
thinking about this shit?

182
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:23,348
Take a guy who wants
to fuck a monkey.

183
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,934
The theory is AIDS
started that way.

184
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:29,104
If a guy wants to
fuck a monkey today,

185
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,856
should he use a condom?

186
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:35,444
I'm eating, man! Don't talk
about fucking monkeys.

187
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,070
Did wolves raise you?

188
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:38,989
What do I care?

189
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,991
Cuz I fuck monkeys
or have AIDS?

190
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,243
What the fuck.

191
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,830
OK, sorry. It was
a valid question.

192
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:50,334
They only ate monkeys.
The rest was made up.

193
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:52,461
Who'd be so sick
he'd rape an animal?

194
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,587
Lots of people.

195
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,674
Legally, I'm not sure
"monkey rape" exists.

196
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:59,718
Sure it does.
Animals have rights.

197
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:03,597
The monkey won't turn
anorexic and see a therapist.

198
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,390
It's not the same.

199
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:07,559
Monkeys are self-aware.

200
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:10,354
They see themselves,
in a mirror, right?

201
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:13,523
I bet a raped monkey
suffers like a woman.

202
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,067
So a raped woman,

203
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:16,860
raped monkey, same thing?

204
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,197
Yeah.

205
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:25,786
What I'm saying
isn't so crazy.

206
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:28,372
Why are we in vet school?

207
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:59,319
Unbelievable.

208
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,241
It's easy, really.

209
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:17,504
I expected
no less from you.

210
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:20,966
Let's see if your
reputation is earned.

211
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:22,300
Oh.

212
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,928
One mistake already.

213
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:27,014
Off to a bad start.

214
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:28,807
May I?

215
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:30,183
No. Too late.

216
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,768
There.

217
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:36,500
Hey. Are you OK?
Yeah. Stay out.

218
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:10,594
Oh, that is bad.

219
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,596
Any allergies?

220
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:13,930
I don't think so.

221
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:15,473
OK.

222
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,436
Will I get it
on my face?

223
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:23,106
No, no. It won't last long.
It's already peeling.

224
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,443
Any nausea?
Yeah.

225
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:27,903
Since when?

226
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,029
At the same time.

227
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:30,947
OK. Last period?

228
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:33,366
I'm not sure.

229
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:35,285
A week or two?

230
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:37,495
OK. Are you on the pill?

231
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:38,663
No.

232
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:41,625
Do you use condoms?

233
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,793
I've never...

234
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:46,046
Right.

235
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,298
OK.

236
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:50,634
Ouch.

237
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:54,387
And this is your rush week?

238
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:57,307
OK. I think

239
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,102
it's food poisoning
and you're having a reaction.

240
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:04,648
Drink lots of liquids.
Water, that is.

241
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:07,609
Avoid solids.
Fast a whole day, even.

242
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:09,069
I'll get you a cream.

243
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:12,405
I am hungry though.
My stomach always feels empty.

244
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:13,531
Yeah.

245
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:15,825
What'd they give you?

246
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:17,369
Raw rabbit kidneys.

247
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:22,540
Someone tells you to eat raw
rabbit kidney, and you do?

248
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:24,584
I said no.
Did they force you?

249
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:26,294
No.

250
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:27,420
OK. Keep it.

251
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:29,673
Use it three times a day.
Thanks.

252
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:35,220
I used to work at
the hospital here.

253
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:39,099
One day, they sent a girl
your age for blood tests.

254
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:42,102
She was round.

255
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:45,355
Mmm.

256
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,607
Fat, actually.

257
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:50,568
A really nice girl,
really sweet.

258
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:53,530
Some freak out over
needles, but not her.

259
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:54,864
Mmm.

260
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:57,242
She had a ton
of tests to do.

261
00:26:57,701 --> 00:26:59,244
So it goes well.

262
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:01,871
She gets dressed
and bursts into tears.

263
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,124
I ask what's wrong
and she says

264
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:07,377
I'm the first person
to not mention her weight.

265
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:10,297
Why would I?

266
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:13,383
The test was
totally unrelated.

267
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:16,761
She said the interns
sent her ward to ward,

268
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:21,057
saying they couldn't jab her
due to the fat on her arms.

269
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:25,895
They said to lose
weight and come back.

270
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:29,232
Can you imagine?

271
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:32,235
Nonsense. I'd had no
trouble finding a vein.

272
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,404
Why didn't she report it?

273
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:38,658
Why? Don't know. To not
bother anyone, I guess.

274
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:41,453
She kind of stood out.

275
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:44,914
She probably
wanted to be average.

276
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:47,667
How do you see yourself?

277
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:50,962
Average.

278
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:53,631
Find yourself a quiet
corner. Wait it out.

279
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:55,508
The year always
starts out rough.

280
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:12,942
Eyes to the floor
for an elder, rookie!

281
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:17,280
You wearing that?
You didn't hear today?

282
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:18,406
Hear what?

283
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,617
The dress code is
night club. Go change.

284
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,285
Girls wear something hot.

285
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:24,162
Not t-shirts with sequins.

286
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:25,538
This is all I have.

287
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:27,957
Is that a no?
I'll have to look.

288
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,460
OK. Uniform then.

289
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:42,639
Can I help you?

290
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,142
Come in. Hurry up.

291
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,480
Here you have
the septate uterus,

292
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:54,442
characterized
by its long horns

293
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:57,904
and gradual narrowing
toward the fallopian tubes.

294
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,162
Too small.

295
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,499
No way you're having that.

296
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:13,503
If you'd spoken up, I
wouldn't have had to eat it.

297
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:16,923
Let it go! It was that
or you were a reject.

298
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:19,759
It's your life!
I shouldn't have helped.

299
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:21,261
You didn't!

300
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:28,017
I'm being nice.

301
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:30,520
You'll stretch them
with your big feet.

302
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:35,942
Come here! I'm
not your slave!

303
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:40,780
Your handwriting is awful.

304
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:41,906
What?

305
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:43,741
Do you write on the washer?

306
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:45,243
Hands off!

307
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:48,913
I just fixed a couple things.
Small errors, mostly.

308
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:51,749
Take what you
need and scram.

309
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:56,880
Move.
Can I try it on?

310
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:02,427
Quick.

311
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,403
It's not me.

312
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:22,155
OK, get out.

313
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:23,406
Like this?
Yeah.

314
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:25,950
You piss me off.

315
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:28,411
See you.

316
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:13,206
Fuck this!

317
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:31,641
Could you help me with...

318
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:37,182
Don't stop. So good.

319
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:57,250
That's pork.
So?

320
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:14,183
Grab some ketchup.

321
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:33,286
What's in your pocket?

322
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,246
Sorry?

323
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:37,749
Your lab coat.
There. Show me.

324
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:40,501
Problem solved.

325
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:42,253
I need to see
to ring it up.

326
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:53,931
Stealing a burger's fucked up,
even for me. You need cash?

327
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:55,975
Did anyone see?

328
00:32:56,434 --> 00:32:58,561
Nah. Own it. Why that?

329
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:01,898
Don't know.

330
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:07,487
I'm starving.
It'll be awesome.

331
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:08,780
It's stupid.

332
00:33:08,905 --> 00:33:10,615
It's a first,
we need to celebrate.

333
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:13,743
It's on me.
Great.

334
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:08,423
What's your
sister's problem?

335
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:09,757
What problem?

336
00:34:09,841 --> 00:34:11,008
Let's
sit over there.

337
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:13,469
I don't know, she's
not exactly friendly.

338
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:15,972
What do you know?
You barely talk to her.

339
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:18,391
Neither have you,
since you arrived.

340
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:28,234
I can't if you watch.

341
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,531
Say that you kill
a guy's hard-on for life.

342
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:39,078
It's so bullshit to
sell booze at rest stops.

343
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:41,372
Check the bigwigs.

344
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:44,333
Big rigs, you mean.
Wig's different.

345
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,211
Big wigs are like
VIPs or something.

346
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:52,550
OK. Even with an hour's
sleep, you're still drunk.

347
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:57,513
Do you think they swap blood or
inject water, like cyclists?

348
00:34:58,222 --> 00:34:59,599
Ask him yourself.

349
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:01,559
Where you kids off to?

350
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:06,189
Just having some shawarma.
Then back to campus.

351
00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:08,524
You're at
the vet school?

352
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:14,113
I came down there once with
my pig, he had the flu.

353
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:18,534
Flu's bad for pigs.
But he's better now.

354
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:24,540
You have a pig in your truck?
Yeah.

355
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:28,419
We all do. To swap
our boozer blood.

356
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:33,382
Pigs are almost like humans.
Have you learned that yet?

357
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:35,760
Genetically, or something.

358
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:44,393
Well kiddos,
enjoy your meal.

359
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:48,314
Little lady's hungry.
Don't they feed you down there?

360
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,945
School's good.
You're lucky.

361
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:09,252
You're up?

362
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,755
For breakfast.

363
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:15,591
Putting on a barbecue?

364
00:36:19,846 --> 00:36:20,930
What do you eat?

365
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:22,849
Cereal.

366
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:25,184
Cereal's up there.

367
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:27,770
I'm just getting milk, OK?

368
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,336
So you cheated.

369
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:53,462
No.

370
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:55,631
You admit
your friend did.

371
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:56,799
No.

372
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,595
Miss, I don't have a soft
spot for top students,

373
00:37:00,678 --> 00:37:03,347
unlike all my colleagues,

374
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:07,018
I feel more sympathy
for your friend than you.

375
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,813
School is tough for him.
He has to fight to stay.

376
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:12,315
But you,

377
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:14,150
the wonder child,

378
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,153
you ride in and
depress my students.

379
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:21,032
Some would sooner drop out than
compare themselves to you.

380
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:23,409
You aren't needed here.

381
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:26,495
Worse, you scare away
excellent doctors.

382
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:27,872
As you can guess,

383
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:33,336
I'd rather see your ranking
drop than your friend's.

384
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:40,009
It was him.

385
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:47,118
Two fingers will
make it come up faster.

386
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:08,431
Alex!

387
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:10,141
Hey!

388
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:12,601
Alex! Alex!

389
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:15,021
Can we talk?

390
00:39:15,146 --> 00:39:16,188
Can't hear you!

391
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:17,440
We have to talk.

392
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:18,774
Afterwards!

393
00:39:28,826 --> 00:39:31,412
One time I made out
with a one-armed guy.

394
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:32,538
No way.

395
00:39:32,663 --> 00:39:35,624
Yeah. It took
me two hours to notice.

396
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:40,504
You know, he draped a blazer
over his shoulder.

397
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:44,633
I thought, OK, country club,
must have money.

398
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:48,304
But no, he just had
one arm.

399
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:53,476
Alex?
Mmm?

400
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:55,644
Do you think I'm weird?

401
00:39:56,312 --> 00:39:58,230
What? No! Why?

402
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:00,816
You know you're
the favorite.

403
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,903
I'm the weirdo in the family.
Always have been.

404
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,867
What are you doing?
What the fuck?

405
00:40:12,995 --> 00:40:15,873
Hips pushed out,
see. And go!

406
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:17,333
No hands.

407
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:19,001
How do you do that?

408
00:40:19,085 --> 00:40:22,505
Go on, let's see
how far you shoot.

409
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:25,591
Push hard to get a strong
stream and it works.

410
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:30,054
I'll go all over myself.

411
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:32,056
Deep breath...

412
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:35,518
Fuck! I'm pissing
on myself!

413
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:37,728
Normal squat!
Normal squat!

414
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:39,855
I'm still peeing.

415
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:42,900
Damn!

416
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:45,861
So gross.

417
00:40:51,742 --> 00:40:53,410
Let's go, it's raining.

418
00:40:54,954 --> 00:40:57,623
Can I sleep over?
I don't feel well.

419
00:40:58,082 --> 00:41:00,417
You never
feel well, ever.

420
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:44,461
What? What's wrong?

421
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:49,091
Stay still.

422
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:53,095
Better?

423
00:41:54,263 --> 00:41:56,348
Looks the same to me.

424
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:01,812
At your age, I already
gave myself Brazilians.

425
00:42:02,021 --> 00:42:03,105
What's that?

426
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:36,347
It's scorching.
Will it hurt a lot?

427
00:42:36,847 --> 00:42:38,224
Beauty is pain.

428
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:51,237
I'm amazing.

429
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:53,155
No, I can't.

430
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,823
And leave it like that?
It's uneven.

431
00:42:54,907 --> 00:42:56,450
No, this is torture.

432
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:59,995
Great, now it's worse. Let me
do the other side at least.

433
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:09,380
Tell me when
you're... Ow!

434
00:43:11,674 --> 00:43:13,759
No! No!
Come on. We all do it.

435
00:43:27,356 --> 00:43:28,983
Shit.

436
00:43:29,066 --> 00:43:30,818
What? Tell me.

437
00:43:30,901 --> 00:43:32,236
Odd
It's stuck?

438
00:43:32,361 --> 00:43:34,363
I don't know.
What's Plan B?

439
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:36,282
This is weird. Wait.

440
00:43:40,536 --> 00:43:41,537
Get away!

441
00:43:42,705 --> 00:43:44,581
You'll circumcise me!
We have to.

442
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:47,584
You're shaking.

443
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:49,878
It's my pussy!

444
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:52,715
What?

445
00:43:53,757 --> 00:43:54,800
What? What is it?

446
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:05,769
Alex! Hey! Hey!

447
00:44:06,145 --> 00:44:07,730
Hey! Hey!

448
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:14,945
My sister cut her finger.

449
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:17,489
With scissors.

450
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:21,827
Cutting something,
who cares!

451
00:44:23,996 --> 00:44:25,080
15 minutes?

452
00:44:25,622 --> 00:44:27,249
Ice? OK, I know.

453
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:29,585
OK.

454
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:17,020
Anyone seen you for the prosthesis?
What?

455
00:48:17,396 --> 00:48:19,815
- Didn't they sew it back on?
- Nope.

456
00:48:20,524 --> 00:48:22,484
Quicky ate my finger.

457
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:25,362
The doctor
will be by soon.

458
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:27,739
What about her rehab?
How does it work?

459
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:30,534
No nerve damage, no rehab.
There's no point.

460
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:33,161
You're leaving her
like this? Really?

461
00:48:33,245 --> 00:48:34,371
She can't eat!

462
00:48:34,496 --> 00:48:36,707
I'm not disabled.
Yes, you are!

463
00:48:36,832 --> 00:48:38,750
- You'd like that!
- Don't say that.

464
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:40,419
Shit, leave her alone!

465
00:48:40,711 --> 00:48:43,714
Don't talk to your mother that way.
What's wrong?

466
00:48:45,674 --> 00:48:46,717
I'm going to piss.

467
00:48:46,842 --> 00:48:47,843
Me too.

468
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:49,678
What the hell? OW.

469
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:54,725
Ouch!

470
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:39,561
Apologize to your mother.

471
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:41,480
I'm not going
back in there.

472
00:49:42,064 --> 00:49:43,315
Do you smoke?

473
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:44,983
Yeah.

474
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:51,615
Who has Quicky?

475
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:54,159
He'll be put
down, if not already.

476
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:56,620
Why? He didn't attack her.
That's cruel!

477
00:49:56,912 --> 00:50:00,666
They have to. An animal that has
tasted human flesh isn't safe.

478
00:50:00,749 --> 00:50:02,751
If he likes it,
he'll bite again.

479
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:05,087
Can't he just take a pill?

480
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:08,256
Medicine's not an exact science.
You'll see.

481
00:50:11,927 --> 00:50:14,513
Don't have two girls,
honey. It's too hard.

482
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:39,287
Mom and
Dad still here?

483
00:50:39,371 --> 00:50:40,455
No.

484
00:50:46,628 --> 00:50:49,715
- Where are you going?
- We... We need to talk.

485
00:50:59,516 --> 00:51:00,684
Here's good.

486
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:17,659
You wanted to talk?

487
00:51:17,743 --> 00:51:18,785
What about?

488
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:20,746
You asked.
Something to say?

489
00:51:21,371 --> 00:51:24,166
No, you brought
me out here.

490
00:51:24,374 --> 00:51:25,417
So?

491
00:51:26,001 --> 00:51:27,085
I've nothing to say.

492
00:51:27,335 --> 00:51:29,880
Stop mind fucking me then!
You're like Mom!

493
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:32,507
You sound like Mom.

494
00:51:41,767 --> 00:51:43,518
If we're here for deer,
I'll kill you.

495
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:45,395
You're so aggressive.

496
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,022
No, I'm not.

497
00:51:47,105 --> 00:51:48,523
Anger management issues!

498
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,858
I'm not angry!
Stay here!

499
00:51:50,066 --> 00:51:51,109
Alex!

500
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:10,253
Alex?

501
00:52:12,214 --> 00:52:14,090
Are you OK?

502
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:36,696
What's wrong with you?

503
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:38,949
Nice, yell at me now.

504
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:02,430
Shit.

505
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:08,603
Don't! What
are you doing?

506
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:10,272
Stop.

507
00:53:10,856 --> 00:53:12,941
Why are you
opening the door?

508
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:19,656
He won't make it.

509
00:53:33,837 --> 00:53:35,171
Spit it out!

510
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:36,798
I said, spit!

511
00:53:37,048 --> 00:53:38,300
Fuck! Are you kidding?

512
00:53:38,383 --> 00:53:40,385
I did this
for you, idiot!

513
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:42,137
You need
to learn, right?

514
00:54:32,729 --> 00:54:34,356
What did I miss?

515
00:54:35,774 --> 00:54:37,609
Do me up.

516
00:54:56,962 --> 00:54:58,046
Done?

517
00:54:59,047 --> 00:55:00,382
It's the gloves.

518
00:55:00,632 --> 00:55:02,592
- Take them off.
- Remove the sheet.

519
00:55:03,051 --> 00:55:04,302
We're starting.

520
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:07,055
Geez. What a pain.

521
00:55:09,933 --> 00:55:12,560
You may begin.
You have an hour.

522
00:55:17,607 --> 00:55:18,650
Sorry for your sis.

523
00:55:18,942 --> 00:55:21,236
No shit. I thought
you hated her.

524
00:55:21,903 --> 00:55:23,238
It's still fucked.

525
00:55:23,488 --> 00:55:24,781
It's just a finger.

526
00:55:26,408 --> 00:55:27,409
Very nice.

527
00:55:28,243 --> 00:55:29,786
Look, get right in there.

528
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:31,329
Dive in, don't be afraid.

529
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:33,581
Tell her.
She'll like that.

541
00:57:31,074 --> 00:57:32,534
Did you touch it?

542
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:33,701
Did you?

543
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,208
You're insane, man.

You play 10 to 9,
no wonder.

576
01:00:26,249 --> 01:00:28,001
Cute! Got my
cocktail dress on.

577
01:00:28,084 --> 01:00:30,378
Off to get deflowered
at your prom?

578
01:00:31,087 --> 01:00:32,171
I'm off.

579
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,540
Where to?

580
01:00:33,673 --> 01:00:35,258
Hospital party.
It's hardcore.

581
01:00:36,009 --> 01:00:39,554
They party on call and
barf if someone comes in.

582
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:43,224
They treat the guy,
then go back.

583
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:44,909
Luckily, you had
nothing to sew back on.

584
01:00:44,934 --> 01:00:46,436
It'd be on backwards.

- Later.

01:00:53,276 --> 01:00:54,736
I thought he was gay.

589
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:57,613
You want to play?

590
01:00:57,739 --> 01:00:58,906
Yeah.

591
01:01:04,203 --> 01:01:05,204
Did you lose weight?

592
01:01:05,288 --> 01:01:07,415
My dress fits you better.
It's less slutty.

593
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:10,209
Thank you.

594
01:01:11,044 --> 01:01:14,922
It's not a compliment. You better
not be anorexic. It's gross.

595
01:01:15,465 --> 01:01:16,507
I'm not sick.

01:01:16,591 --> 01:01:20,720
You will be if you keep it up. I know
what happens. You won't hold up.

597
01:01:20,803 --> 01:01:24,098
I'm not you. Do your thing.
I don't need that.

598
01:01:24,265 --> 01:01:25,308
Really.

599
01:01:25,433 --> 01:01:27,643
No. I just tried it.

600
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:32,565
You couldn't try something
other than my finger?

601
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:35,276
Nothing else on the menu
looked good?

602
01:01:38,279 --> 01:01:39,572
Was it good at least?

603
01:01:40,323 --> 01:01:41,783
You taste like curry.

01:02:21,864 --> 01:02:23,032
Alex?

608
01:02:58,693 --> 01:02:59,861
Stop!

609
01:03:01,821 --> 01:03:02,864
Alex!

610
01:04:21,984 --> 01:04:23,069
Thanks.

611
01:04:23,319 --> 01:04:24,737
Yeah, that one.
The yellow one.

612
01:04:26,447 --> 01:04:28,115
Wait, forget it.
This'll do.

613
01:04:28,324 --> 01:04:32,161
Let's go. Don't come
out until you're green.

614
01:04:38,668 --> 01:04:39,752
Come here.

615
01:05:18,541 --> 01:05:20,501
It's OK, we'll go slow.

616
01:05:53,492 --> 01:05:55,870
Fuck! What's wrong?
She's fucking insane.

617
01:07:06,232 --> 01:07:07,316
Want a drag?

618
01:07:08,776 --> 01:07:09,944
Come here.

619
01:07:11,904 --> 01:07:13,322
Wait.

620
01:07:17,952 --> 01:07:19,286
Did he grab you?

621
01:07:19,662 --> 01:07:20,913
Yeah, but still.

622
01:07:21,288 --> 01:07:22,790
- He didn't force you.
- No.

623
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,168
You like him?

624
01:07:26,961 --> 01:07:28,170
I don't know.

625
01:07:28,421 --> 01:07:29,505
He turns you on.

626
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:31,132
I don't know.

627
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:34,093
You still turned on now?
Why do you ask?

628
01:07:34,802 --> 01:07:36,971
To figure out
how you work.

629
01:07:37,471 --> 01:07:38,848
How I work?

630
01:07:38,973 --> 01:07:41,475
If you like S&M
shit, or worse.

631
01:07:44,437 --> 01:07:46,856
Are you going to kiss me?
No.

632
01:07:47,773 --> 01:07:49,442
So why stress out?

633
01:07:49,525 --> 01:07:50,818
I'm not.

634
01:07:53,154 --> 01:07:54,613
Should I be?

635
01:07:56,991 --> 01:07:59,827
OK. I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

636
01:08:44,163 --> 01:08:45,372
It's bad.

637
01:09:58,279 --> 01:09:59,780
Stop it.

638
01:10:06,287 --> 01:10:07,454
Stop it!

639
01:11:21,862 --> 01:11:24,198
Tell my sister to look
at her phone. Alex.

640
01:11:27,868 --> 01:11:31,705
Mom says they put Quicky down.
She's so sad. LOL #waytoocute

641
01:11:35,834 --> 01:11:37,378
My sister has
your number?

642
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:46,387
Sure. Ignore me.

643
01:11:46,762 --> 01:11:49,056
Nice way to treat a girl
after deflowering her.

644
01:11:49,181 --> 01:11:50,557
Makes me feel great.

645
01:11:51,767 --> 01:11:52,851
Screw your sister!

646
01:11:53,102 --> 01:11:54,311
It's not about
my sister.

647
01:11:54,395 --> 01:11:56,105
Did something happen?

648
01:11:57,356 --> 01:12:01,610
I'm sorry. We... I shouldn't
have done that with you.

649
01:12:01,902 --> 01:12:05,072
What do you mean? Cut the crap.
It's my fault now?

650
01:12:05,781 --> 01:12:07,032
Oh, so,
I'm too crazy?

651
01:12:07,908 --> 01:12:09,410
I'm gay. OK?

652
01:12:09,702 --> 01:12:11,328
If I spent
20 years hiding,

653
01:12:11,412 --> 01:12:13,414
it's not to fuck
girls now, OK?

654
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:23,192
Hey! Come here,
come here.

655
01:13:23,317 --> 01:13:24,860
One shot, please.

656
01:13:25,486 --> 01:13:27,863
I'm out of glasses, is that OK?
A small one.

657
01:13:27,988 --> 01:13:29,656
Yeah, sure.
Here.

658
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:34,661
More. More, more. More, more.
Save me the trip.

659
01:14:33,887 --> 01:14:36,431
Find someone
else, bitch!

660
01:14:37,891 --> 01:14:39,935
What's her problem?

661
01:14:40,936 --> 01:14:42,729
What are you doing here?

662
01:14:43,355 --> 01:14:46,233
They're no fun.
Let's split.

663
01:14:46,358 --> 01:14:49,695
Stick around.
We're funny for sure.

664
01:14:49,778 --> 01:14:51,280
Oh yeah, for sure.

665
01:14:54,575 --> 01:14:55,742
Come on.

666
01:15:18,557 --> 01:15:19,725
Come on.

667
01:17:09,376 --> 01:17:11,003
Come here.
We need to talk.

668
01:17:12,713 --> 01:17:13,880
What?

669
01:17:18,218 --> 01:17:19,761
Got something to say?

670
01:17:26,226 --> 01:17:27,602
What is it?

671
01:17:29,896 --> 01:17:31,231
<i>Go fetch!</i>

672
01:17:35,569 --> 01:17:36,778
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

673
01:17:40,866 --> 01:17:41,992
<i>She's so fucked up.</i>

674
01:17:42,075 --> 01:17:43,243
<i>Don't film it, come on!</i>

675
01:17:48,707 --> 01:17:50,917
<i>Hey! Bite.</i>

676
01:17:54,921 --> 01:17:56,340
Go on.

677
01:17:57,215 --> 01:17:58,925
<i>Bite him, Justine!</i>

678
01:18:10,354 --> 01:18:12,105
<i>This is
fucked up, stop it.</i>

679
01:18:20,072 --> 01:18:21,406
Where were you?

680
01:18:21,615 --> 01:18:22,699
You let her do that?

681
01:18:22,783 --> 01:18:24,076
Wait. Stop, calm down.

682
01:18:24,284 --> 01:18:26,286
Move. Let me go.

683
01:18:26,411 --> 01:18:28,789
Calm down now.
Get out of my way!

684
01:18:29,122 --> 01:18:30,957
Stop it, fuck.
Fuck off.

685
01:18:34,378 --> 01:18:36,296
Fuck it, it's your life.

686
01:19:16,753 --> 01:19:17,963
You taste like shit.

687
01:19:22,759 --> 01:19:24,344
Are you OK?
Move.

688
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:21,586
Hey.

689
01:21:27,592 --> 01:21:28,635
Yeah.

690
01:24:45,123 --> 01:24:47,083
Adrien! Adrien!

691
01:24:54,966 --> 01:24:56,176
Adrien!

692
01:24:57,927 --> 01:24:59,179
Adrien!

693
01:25:10,356 --> 01:25:12,484
Why didn't you fight back?

694
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,284
Hit me!

695
01:25:22,702 --> 01:25:23,703
Hit me!

696
01:25:24,662 --> 01:25:26,664
You should have hit me.

697
01:30:20,083 --> 01:30:21,501
Finish your veggies.

698
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:23,795
I'm full.

699
01:30:36,933 --> 01:30:39,352
Don't leave the table
until you're done.

700
01:30:47,193 --> 01:30:49,195
Don't take it personally.

701
01:30:49,612 --> 01:30:50,863
I know.

702
01:30:55,201 --> 01:30:56,285
It's not your fault.

703
01:30:57,620 --> 01:30:58,788
I know, Dad.

704
01:31:06,003 --> 01:31:07,505
Or your sister's.

705
01:31:09,382 --> 01:31:10,550
What?

706
01:31:14,178 --> 01:31:16,806
When she was born,
she was our little princess.

707
01:31:17,181 --> 01:31:18,850
We took her everywhere.

708
01:31:19,725 --> 01:31:21,227
Our friends loved her.

709
01:31:21,477 --> 01:31:23,646
She was full tilt
from the start.

710
01:31:23,896 --> 01:31:26,566
She should have studied politics
or something.

711
01:31:29,902 --> 01:31:32,572
So, I guess she
got used to being...

712
01:31:33,739 --> 01:31:35,074
herself.

713
01:31:40,746 --> 01:31:43,082
It's our fault.
We didn't find a solution.

714
01:31:44,917 --> 01:31:46,252
What do you mean?

715
01:31:53,759 --> 01:31:55,845
Your mom was
tough at first.

716
01:31:56,846 --> 01:31:58,848
Kept saying I was her
best friend at school.

717
01:31:58,931 --> 01:32:00,516
It drove me nuts.

718
01:32:02,602 --> 01:32:04,687
It's not like she
had a boyfriend.

719
01:32:05,188 --> 01:32:06,230
Just me.

720
01:32:09,442 --> 01:32:11,903
And then we had
our first kiss.

721
01:32:13,112 --> 01:32:14,447
And I understood.

722
01:32:40,097 --> 01:32:42,725
I'm sure you'll
find a solution, honey.

722
01:32:43,305 --> 01:33:43,920
