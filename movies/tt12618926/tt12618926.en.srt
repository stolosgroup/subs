{\an8}MADRID 2016. WINTER.

4
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:06,302
Can you smile with your eyes?

5
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:09,719
Now relax your face,

6
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:11,677
look the other way and turn to me.

7
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,760
That's it.

8
00:01:16,386 --> 00:01:18,802
PARALLEL MOTHERS

9
00:01:25,677 --> 00:01:27,844
Rest your arms on the table.

10
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:33,927
Your chin...

11
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,802
Without pressing it.
Now the other one.

12
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:39,511
Very good.

13
00:01:41,386 --> 00:01:42,885
Can you smile a bit?

14
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:46,177
Look at me.

15
00:01:48,261 --> 00:01:49,428
Look at the lens.

16
00:01:58,553 --> 00:01:59,428
Your coffee.

17
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:01,844
Janis, do you want the skulls now?

18
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:04,635
I don't know, I'll tell you later.

19
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:07,677
Shall we sit down?

20
00:02:10,428 --> 00:02:11,885
What are the skulls for?

21
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,135
They asked for a Hamlet pose,

22
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,136
like that, with the skull.

23
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:18,885
But I think it's too obvious

24
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:21,677
to have a forensic anthropologist
with a skull.

25
00:02:23,052 --> 00:02:25,428
-We're not doing it.
-I'm glad.

26
00:02:26,635 --> 00:02:28,885
The editor said you wanted
to ask me something.

27
00:02:30,553 --> 00:02:31,677
Yes.

28
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:34,719
If you have a minute
we'll talk after the session.

29
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:36,428
Sure, no problem.

30
00:02:37,011 --> 00:02:39,760
I wanted to ask you
about excavating a grave.

31
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:42,511
Go ahead.

32
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:46,094
Outside my town
there's a grave with ten bodies.

33
00:02:46,303 --> 00:02:48,052
One is my great-grandfather.

34
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:49,844
When the Historical Memory Law came out

35
00:02:49,927 --> 00:02:52,219
the judge for my town recused himself

36
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:54,386
and since then
we haven't gotten anywhere.

37
00:02:54,469 --> 00:02:57,927
It's worse now,
they've withdrawn all the subsidies.

38
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,052
President Rajoy boasted in an interview

39
00:03:00,261 --> 00:03:03,677
that in the State Budgets there were
zero euros for the Historical Memory.

40
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,719
-I read that.
-It's outrageous.

41
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:08,386
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

42
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:09,386
Sure.

43
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:12,635
In the Historical Memory Association
in my town,

44
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,469
we have a very complete dossier
of the grave.

45
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:17,052
Do you know exactly where it is?

46
00:03:17,136 --> 00:03:20,386
The whole town knows,
that's why it hasn't been touched.

47
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:22,677
My grandmother left me all the details.

48
00:03:23,886 --> 00:03:25,469
The grave is here.

49
00:03:26,011 --> 00:03:29,011
They took my great-grandfather away
at the start of the war,

50
00:03:29,094 --> 00:03:30,052
the first week.

51
00:03:30,261 --> 00:03:31,760
How are you so sure of the place?

52
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:35,844
One of the victims
that Franco's soldiers buried,

53
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:38,594
Manuel Blanco Trujillo,

54
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,886
wasn't dead,
just badly injured.

55
00:03:41,178 --> 00:03:45,219
At night he got out of the grave,
made it home and told everything.

56
00:03:46,136 --> 00:03:47,594
Before he escaped,

57
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:51,594
he told his family where the grave was
and who was in it.

58
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:54,303
My great-grandfather.

59
00:03:54,386 --> 00:03:56,178
He was a teacher and a photographer.

60
00:03:56,635 --> 00:03:58,594
By chance, before the war,

61
00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:01,219
he took photos of all those
who later died with him.

62
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:05,594
Nicasio Sanz García, the Carlist.

63
00:04:06,303 --> 00:04:08,635
Facundo Nuño Tomé.

64
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,219
José Gutiérrez Castro
and Francisco Alonso González.

65
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:15,719
Gregorio Sánchez Muñoz, Pug-nose.

66
00:04:16,386 --> 00:04:20,303
César Cruz Arranz.
His daughter Brígida is still alive.

67
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:23,303
Teófilo Robles García.

68
00:04:24,052 --> 00:04:26,844
Pepe Medina Sánchez
and Benito García Rodríguez.

69
00:04:28,386 --> 00:04:29,719
My grandmother.

70
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:33,635
She wrote down the names of all those
who disappeared with her father.

71
00:04:33,927 --> 00:04:35,927
I'll show them to you later.

72
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:39,719
Some families are still in the town,
others aren't.

73
00:04:39,802 --> 00:04:41,386
Some are from the next town.

74
00:04:41,927 --> 00:04:44,677
All this information
makes things easier.

75
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:49,927
The association
has been saving a bit all these years.

76
00:04:50,011 --> 00:04:51,844
We'd like to know

77
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:56,219
what it would cost to hire you privately
to do the excavation.

78
00:04:56,303 --> 00:04:59,303
I'd do it for free,
but I can't do it on my own.

79
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,510
The whole town would help you.

80
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:06,303
We need specialists
in archaeological excavations.

81
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,510
Pick-and-shovel workers can't do it.

82
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:09,677
Of course not.

83
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:14,011
Even so, the whole town
will do anything to help.

84
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:16,844
I'm improvising...

85
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,969
I belong to a private foundation,

86
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:23,844
the <i>Association for the Recovery
of the Historical Memory.</i>

87
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:25,386
-I knew that.
-You did?

88
00:05:25,677 --> 00:05:27,635
Yes, but I didn't dare.

89
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:28,719
Some wine?

90
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:31,677
It's a scientific foundation

91
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:35,219
and it investigates everything to do
with our cultural roots.

92
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:38,094
Our work isn't opening graves,

93
00:05:38,386 --> 00:05:41,136
but things are so precarious
we've already intervened in one.

94
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:43,094
It depends on where it is,
when it was,

95
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,969
if it gives us new information
about the war...

96
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:49,677
For example,
the fact that the one in your town

97
00:05:49,761 --> 00:05:53,469
dates from the first days of the war
is an interesting detail.

98
00:05:53,844 --> 00:05:56,136
It was the night of July 25,

99
00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:58,510
according to my grandmother
and others in the town.

100
00:05:58,594 --> 00:06:01,844
You could present the project
to the foundation.

101
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:04,552
I'll make sure that
at least they consider it.

102
00:06:06,677 --> 00:06:08,261
I really appreciate that.

103
00:06:08,344 --> 00:06:10,594
But it wouldn't be immediate.

104
00:06:10,677 --> 00:06:13,344
The foundation decides on its projects
years in advance,

105
00:06:13,844 --> 00:06:15,677
but it's worth us trying.

106
00:06:15,761 --> 00:06:16,802
Of course.

107
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,385
Thank you, really.

108
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,594
I have to leave early,
I'm taking my husband to the doctor.

109
00:06:28,677 --> 00:06:29,886
Of course.

110
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:31,053
How is he?

111
00:06:31,136 --> 00:06:32,594
A bit nervous.

112
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:36,802
Poor thing.

113
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:44,844
Yes?

114
00:06:45,136 --> 00:06:46,802
<i>Hello, Janis. How are you?</i>

115
00:06:47,136 --> 00:06:48,594
Hello, Arturo.

116
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:52,136
<i>I'm calling because the foundation
has received the dossier.</i>

117
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:53,303
<i>They'll contact you.</i>

118
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:57,677
I sent it all three days
after I took your photo.

119
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:00,094
<i>Just one thing...</i>

120
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:03,510
<i>I'll be in Madrid next week
to do an appraisal</i>

121
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:06,677
<i>and I thought we could meet,
if it suits you.</i>

122
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,178
What day?

123
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:10,761
<i>Next Wednesday.</i>

124
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:13,594
I'm free in the afternoon.

125
00:07:14,094 --> 00:07:16,844
<i>I'll see you Wednesday then.</i>

126
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,219
See you then.

127
00:08:27,636 --> 00:08:29,344
Breathe through your nose.

128
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,094
Deeply.

129
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:34,886
Not like this...

130
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:36,178
That's worse.

131
00:08:43,677 --> 00:08:45,011
That's it.

132
00:08:53,844 --> 00:08:57,219
Don't be scared.
Everything's going to be fine.

133
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:58,178
You'll see.

134
00:09:19,677 --> 00:09:21,136
Are you married?

135
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:23,260
No, are you?

136
00:09:23,469 --> 00:09:24,844
Me?

137
00:09:24,928 --> 00:09:26,302
No.

138
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:29,469
So we're both single mothers.

139
00:09:30,928 --> 00:09:34,177
Mine was an accident
but I'm so happy.

140
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:39,011
Mine was an accident too.

141
00:09:40,719 --> 00:09:42,344
I don't regret it.

142
00:09:44,928 --> 00:09:45,844
I do.

143
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,260
Poor thing, don't say that.

144
00:09:50,344 --> 00:09:52,803
It'll all work out, you'll see.

145
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,886
You're not on your own, are you?

146
00:09:56,552 --> 00:09:59,053
No, I'm with my mother.

147
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:00,302
OK.

148
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:02,344
She still hasn't gotten used to the idea.

149
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:04,344
She will.

150
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:20,719
Ana!

151
00:10:23,053 --> 00:10:24,260
Shouldn't you be in bed?

152
00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:29,177
It's good for her to walk,
it helps the baby drop down.

153
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:32,928
I'm Janis, her roommate.

154
00:10:33,011 --> 00:10:34,385
I'm Teresa, her mother.

155
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:36,928
Where's the room?

156
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,761
There.

157
00:10:38,844 --> 00:10:40,260
Shall we go?

158
00:10:52,677 --> 00:10:54,928
Take it slowly.

159
00:10:55,761 --> 00:10:57,511
I spoke to your father.

160
00:10:57,594 --> 00:10:59,219
He can't come.

161
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:01,302
I guessed that.

162
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:04,594
He wishes us luck,
and you're not to worry.

163
00:11:06,636 --> 00:11:07,677
Yeah.

164
00:11:10,552 --> 00:11:11,761
Here I am.

165
00:11:14,928 --> 00:11:16,928
Hello, sweetheart.

166
00:11:19,636 --> 00:11:21,427
Does it hurt a lot?

167
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:23,928
They're about to give us an epidural.

168
00:11:24,594 --> 00:11:26,761
I'm dying to see Cecilia's little face.

169
00:11:26,844 --> 00:11:27,886
Me too.

170
00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:30,677
What your grandmother
would give to be here...

171
00:11:32,469 --> 00:11:35,386
-That's Ana, and her mother, Teresa.
-Hello.

172
00:11:35,469 --> 00:11:37,260
Elena is my best friend.

173
00:11:37,469 --> 00:11:38,844
A pleasure.

174
00:11:38,928 --> 00:11:40,177
You're both almost ready, eh?

175
00:11:40,677 --> 00:11:42,135
Almost, yes.

176
00:11:43,844 --> 00:11:46,719
I'm going to push...

177
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,469
That's good.

178
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,636
Rest, breathe in.

179
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:04,010
Breathe slowly.

180
00:12:04,094 --> 00:12:05,886
-I can't...
-Yes, you can.

181
00:12:05,969 --> 00:12:08,302
You're doing very well, love.

182
00:12:16,844 --> 00:12:18,552
I can see her head.

183
00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:20,260
I can see her hair.

184
00:12:20,344 --> 00:12:21,511
She's got hair!

185
00:12:22,761 --> 00:12:23,803
It's amazing!

186
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:26,260
Don't be afraid, she's there.

187
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:27,678
Come on, one last push.

188
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:32,302
One, two...

189
00:12:32,511 --> 00:12:34,678
and now push hard!

190
00:12:35,886 --> 00:12:39,511
Push hard.

191
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,344
That's it, she's here now.

192
00:12:48,636 --> 00:12:50,886
Hello, my darling.

193
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:53,928
You did very well.

194
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,761
There, there, my love.

195
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,094
Yes?

196
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,927
A nurse told me you were here.

197
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,636
Ana! Come in and sit down.

198
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:26,094
I'm delighted to see you.

199
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:27,886
How's your baby?

200
00:13:28,552 --> 00:13:29,803
She's fine.

201
00:13:29,886 --> 00:13:31,552
She's in observation.

202
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,969
They only left her on me
for a little while.

203
00:13:35,803 --> 00:13:39,344
Isn't it wonderful to hear
her heart beating over yours?

204
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,969
I'm longing to get her back.

205
00:13:43,386 --> 00:13:45,469
Is she in observation too?

206
00:13:45,552 --> 00:13:46,427
Yes.

207
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:48,094
It must be the normal thing.

208
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:52,094
When mine was born, she was suffering
from extrauterine inadaptation,

209
00:13:52,177 --> 00:13:53,636
so the doctor told me.

210
00:13:55,386 --> 00:13:56,927
Not a great start,

211
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,636
because that's the life ahead of her,
extrauterine.

212
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:00,844
Yes.

213
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,219
But apparently it's nothing.

214
00:14:02,427 --> 00:14:06,511
She had trouble controlling her breathing
outside of the uterus.

215
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,553
What's wrong with yours?

216
00:14:09,636 --> 00:14:12,427
It seems her blood sugar was a bit low,

217
00:14:12,511 --> 00:14:14,261
but they told me too it's nothing.

218
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:16,719
I'm sure of it.

219
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:21,135
I'll give you my number
in case you want to call me.

220
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:25,885
As we're in the same situation,
we can talk about things.

221
00:14:28,885 --> 00:14:30,594
When are you getting her?

222
00:14:30,678 --> 00:14:34,094
Tonight, I think, or this afternoon.

223
00:14:34,177 --> 00:14:35,427
Me too.

224
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:52,344
The cell number is mine.

225
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:55,761
I'm giving you the house phone, too.

226
00:14:57,553 --> 00:14:58,511
Yes?

227
00:14:58,927 --> 00:15:00,969
Hello.

228
00:15:01,052 --> 00:15:01,927
May I?

229
00:15:04,052 --> 00:15:05,719
Hello, love.

230
00:15:06,386 --> 00:15:07,761
How was the audition?

231
00:15:07,844 --> 00:15:10,052
Fantastic!

232
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:12,678
I was there until now.

233
00:15:12,969 --> 00:15:14,719
I was going to do one of the friends,

234
00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:18,261
but I asked the director
to try me out for Rosita,

235
00:15:18,469 --> 00:15:21,636
which is what I'd prepared at home
without anyone asking me.

236
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:24,386
But Doña Rosita is the lead.

237
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:25,302
Yes.

238
00:15:25,386 --> 00:15:28,177
He let me do it
and he was delighted.

239
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:31,969
Then he asked me to read
a very difficult final scene.

240
00:15:32,052 --> 00:15:34,177
He gave me two or three indications

241
00:15:34,386 --> 00:15:38,885
and I connected immediately with that
faded, frustrated part of the character.

242
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,511
That's great, mom.

243
00:15:40,594 --> 00:15:42,219
So he told me to learn

244
00:15:42,427 --> 00:15:45,052
a few more scenes
to continue with the audition tomorrow.

245
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:47,678
I kind of ambushed him

246
00:15:47,761 --> 00:15:49,761
but he liked it

247
00:15:49,844 --> 00:15:52,678
and he was surprised,
I could see it in his face.

248
00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:56,969
Can you imagine if I do Doña Rosita?

249
00:15:58,427 --> 00:15:59,761
Congratulations.

250
00:15:59,844 --> 00:16:01,052
It still isn't certain.

251
00:16:01,136 --> 00:16:03,136
I know they have another actress
for the part,

252
00:16:03,219 --> 00:16:05,386
but I can always dream.

253
00:16:06,636 --> 00:16:08,261
I'm delighted for you.

254
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:09,511
Thank you, darling.

255
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:12,344
Are you two feeling well?

256
00:16:13,261 --> 00:16:14,344
Yes.

257
00:16:16,344 --> 00:16:18,511
Croquettes, Clarissa made them.

258
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:20,261
Where are the babies?

259
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:22,594
They're fine, they're in observation.

260
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,678
I'm off. See you tonight.

261
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,052
Bye, Deborah.

262
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,052
I don't understand this set-up.

263
00:16:37,136 --> 00:16:40,136
She lives here like a duchess
and doesn't even help out.

264
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:42,010
She has to study during the day.

265
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:46,052
It's the only way
to have a babysitter at night.

266
00:16:46,802 --> 00:16:48,969
She goes too far, that Deborah.

267
00:16:49,052 --> 00:16:50,885
And she eats like a horse.

268
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,136
No!

269
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,678
If you see her using the mobile a lot,
tell me.

270
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,594
It's non-stop.

271
00:16:55,678 --> 00:16:57,760
You'll wear out my finger.

272
00:17:02,927 --> 00:17:04,428
Isn't she beautiful!

273
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,636
Be careful, I've just got her to sleep.

274
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:08,760
Yes, yes. I'll see you tonight.

275
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:10,469
Call if you need me.

276
00:17:12,344 --> 00:17:14,844
I'm amazed they've given her the part.

277
00:17:14,927 --> 00:17:17,052
I think she really overacts.

278
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,553
She's very happy.

279
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:23,010
Every day that passed was

280
00:17:23,094 --> 00:17:26,718
like an intimate garment
that was torn from my body.

281
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:30,011
And today a friend marries

282
00:17:30,427 --> 00:17:31,802
and another

283
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,719
and another,

284
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:36,511
and tomorrow she has a child

285
00:17:37,052 --> 00:17:38,511
and he grows,

286
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,094
and she comes to show you
his exam results,

287
00:17:42,802 --> 00:17:46,052
and they make new houses and new songs,

288
00:17:46,553 --> 00:17:48,344
and I am the same,

289
00:17:49,052 --> 00:17:51,177
with the same trembling,

290
00:17:52,553 --> 00:17:53,885
the same.

291
00:17:55,302 --> 00:17:56,927
And one day

292
00:17:57,011 --> 00:18:00,802
I'm out walking and I realize
that I don't know anyone.

293
00:18:01,844 --> 00:18:05,094
Boys and girls who leave me behind

294
00:18:05,177 --> 00:18:07,052
because I get tired.

295
00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:12,511
And one says: "That's the old maid".

296
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:19,760
And another, handsome, with curly hair,
who comments:

297
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:24,177
"No one would want to touch her now".

298
00:18:26,802 --> 00:18:28,677
And I hear him

299
00:18:29,635 --> 00:18:31,760
and I can only shout:

300
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,677
"Let's keep going",

301
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:37,677
with a mouth full of poison

302
00:18:38,594 --> 00:18:41,344
and an enormous desire to run away,

303
00:18:42,428 --> 00:18:44,760
to take off my shoes,

304
00:18:47,553 --> 00:18:49,719
to rest

305
00:18:51,094 --> 00:18:53,136
and not move again,

306
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:56,052
ever,

307
00:18:57,927 --> 00:18:59,511
from my corner.

308
00:19:04,553 --> 00:19:06,511
You're ready to open, Teresa.

309
00:19:06,594 --> 00:19:07,802
Thank you.

310
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:09,094
We've finished for today.

311
00:19:10,011 --> 00:19:13,760
About the opening,
it's the same date, but not in Madrid.

312
00:19:13,844 --> 00:19:14,844
Why's that?

313
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:18,011
The theater still won't be free by then.

314
00:19:18,094 --> 00:19:20,428
We'll do a small tour of the provinces.

315
00:19:20,511 --> 00:19:22,760
During the week
I'll have more information.

316
00:19:22,844 --> 00:19:24,386
So we're postponing the opening?

317
00:19:24,469 --> 00:19:26,719
No, we'll just open outside.

318
00:19:26,802 --> 00:19:28,969
In Bilbao or Valencia,
they'll let us know.

319
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:32,552
It'll be good to open in Madrid
with the play smoothed out.

320
00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:34,760
You could have told us sooner.

321
00:19:34,844 --> 00:19:38,386
I've got things for next month
here in Madrid.

322
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:41,219
I've just heard,
and you've got time to get organized.

323
00:19:41,428 --> 00:19:43,594
-But I can't leave Madrid.
-We'll talk now.

324
00:19:44,136 --> 00:19:46,219
I'll give you details
of the tour tomorrow.

325
00:19:46,428 --> 00:19:48,719
If you have any problem,
now's the time to sort it out.

326
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:51,719
See you tomorrow.

327
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:57,011
I can't leave.

328
00:19:57,094 --> 00:20:00,136
My adolescent daughter is at home
with her newborn baby.

329
00:20:00,219 --> 00:20:01,802
I can't leave them.

330
00:20:01,886 --> 00:20:03,969
You have to sort it out,
that's how theater is.

331
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:05,802
You told me we'd open in Madrid.

332
00:20:05,886 --> 00:20:07,760
But that's impossible.
I'm sorry.

333
00:20:09,594 --> 00:20:11,177
I'll see what I can do,

334
00:20:11,386 --> 00:20:12,844
but I don't know.

335
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,011
Ana,

336
00:20:22,094 --> 00:20:24,927
the theater where we were going
to open in Madrid isn't free.

337
00:20:25,011 --> 00:20:26,719
They've just told me

338
00:20:26,802 --> 00:20:29,178
that we'll tour
the provinces for a few months.

339
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,303
A few months?

340
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,760
Yes.

341
00:20:32,844 --> 00:20:34,219
It's breaking my heart.

342
00:20:34,303 --> 00:20:35,927
I don't want to leave you,

343
00:20:36,011 --> 00:20:39,011
but I've waited my whole life
for a chance like this.

344
00:20:39,094 --> 00:20:40,927
It could change my career.

345
00:20:42,386 --> 00:20:45,719
But if you ask me to stay,
I'll stay.

346
00:20:45,802 --> 00:20:47,594
You know I won't ask you that.

347
00:20:49,136 --> 00:20:52,844
What if we call your father and tell him
you're going back to the town?

348
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:54,886
He'll be delighted.

349
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:56,303
To have me and the baby?

350
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,802
Don't be ridiculous, please.

351
00:20:58,886 --> 00:21:01,510
If I leave the company,
I'll never work again.

352
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,052
And I won't be away all the time.

353
00:21:04,136 --> 00:21:07,719
Monday to Wednesday we don't work,
unless we're in Barcelona.

354
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:09,303
Then go on tour.

355
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,552
But I need help.

356
00:21:11,094 --> 00:21:15,094
You'll have to find a nanny
so that Clarissa can have a break.

357
00:21:16,136 --> 00:21:18,303
A cousin of hers would do it.

358
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,719
I like her and she's got experience.

359
00:21:21,178 --> 00:21:22,719
I don't want a stranger.

360
00:21:23,094 --> 00:21:24,969
-Talk to her about it.
-Of course.

361
00:21:25,052 --> 00:21:27,844
And ask dad for money for my upkeep.

362
00:21:28,594 --> 00:21:30,219
Remind him I'm still a minor.

363
00:21:30,303 --> 00:21:32,927
Don't worry about money,
that isn't a problem.

364
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:39,386
Ana should go back to Granada,
to her friends. She knows nobody here.

365
00:21:39,469 --> 00:21:41,178
<i>I don't think she wants to come back.</i>

366
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:45,886
Call her and ask her lovingly.
Promise her it's the best place for her.

367
00:21:45,969 --> 00:21:49,136
Show a little interest in her,
after all she's been through.

368
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:51,886
<i>If she comes back,
it'll just stir things up again.</i>

369
00:21:51,969 --> 00:21:54,261
I can't miss this chance.

370
00:21:54,344 --> 00:21:56,303
It's horrible that
we're arguing about this!

371
00:21:56,386 --> 00:21:57,719
<i>Ask her if she wants to come.</i>

372
00:21:58,219 --> 00:22:02,927
I'd like to hear that you have
a minimal interest in her going back.

373
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:06,677
Remember that by law
she's your responsibility.

374
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:10,802
You took her from me
and look at how you sent her back.

375
00:22:10,886 --> 00:22:12,802
<i>That's not what we're talking about.</i>

376
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,886
Well, now you know the situation.

377
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:16,969
Call me and tell me what you decide.

378
00:22:39,303 --> 00:22:40,594
Hello.

379
00:22:40,677 --> 00:22:42,719
<i>Hello, Janis. How are you?</i>

380
00:22:43,844 --> 00:22:46,094
Very busy, you can imagine.

381
00:22:46,802 --> 00:22:50,969
<i>I'm in Madrid.
May I drop by and meet Cecilia?</i>

382
00:22:54,761 --> 00:22:57,594
I'm not presentable,
and I'm really busy...

383
00:22:58,761 --> 00:23:00,844
But give me an hour, OK?

384
00:23:01,594 --> 00:23:03,385
<i>OK, thank you.</i>

385
00:23:03,594 --> 00:23:05,552
See you then.

386
00:23:10,303 --> 00:23:12,178
Can I tell you something?

387
00:23:13,385 --> 00:23:16,719
When I finish the course
on Hispanic Philology

388
00:23:16,802 --> 00:23:20,303
I'd like to enroll
for Classical Literature.

389
00:23:20,886 --> 00:23:23,927
Can I carry on staying here?

390
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:25,552
I don't know.

391
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:28,303
If you stay,
you'll have to pay more attention.

392
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,510
You're very scatterbrained.

393
00:23:30,594 --> 00:23:32,761
And don't put on the headphones at night!

394
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:33,761
No...

395
00:23:33,844 --> 00:23:35,303
You do as you please!

396
00:23:37,552 --> 00:23:38,719
I'll get it.

397
00:23:38,802 --> 00:23:40,677
Leave us on our own. Don't appear.

398
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,594
Hello.

399
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:57,094
Happy anniversary.

400
00:23:57,178 --> 00:23:58,510
Anniversary of what?

401
00:23:59,385 --> 00:24:01,927
It's a year today
since we first slept together.

402
00:24:02,011 --> 00:24:03,719
Is it?

403
00:24:23,136 --> 00:24:24,260
Is anything wrong?

404
00:24:25,802 --> 00:24:26,802
I'm pregnant.

405
00:24:28,469 --> 00:24:30,552
And what are you going to do?

406
00:24:31,677 --> 00:24:33,011
Have it.

407
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,802
I've gone over it a thousand times...

408
00:24:38,886 --> 00:24:41,011
I didn't think it could happen,

409
00:24:41,844 --> 00:24:44,928
but I've always wanted children
and I'm almost 40.

410
00:24:45,011 --> 00:24:46,260
Time is passing.

411
00:24:46,344 --> 00:24:47,719
Yeah.

412
00:24:47,802 --> 00:24:49,886
Sorry, I'm kind of in shock.

413
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,594
Yeah.

414
00:24:51,677 --> 00:24:53,552
I love the idea
of having a child with you,

415
00:24:53,636 --> 00:24:54,552
believe me,

416
00:24:54,636 --> 00:24:56,928
but I don't know
if I can allow myself that now.

417
00:24:57,011 --> 00:24:59,260
It isn't a matter of
allowing ourselves that,

418
00:24:59,344 --> 00:25:00,427
it's already here.

419
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:04,260
-Not yet. There are alternatives.
-I'm going to have it.

420
00:25:04,344 --> 00:25:07,385
My wife has cancer,
she's right in the middle of chemotherapy.

421
00:25:07,594 --> 00:25:08,886
I know, and I'm sorry.

422
00:25:08,969 --> 00:25:11,928
It isn't the time to tell her
I'm having a child with someone else.

423
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:15,011
I've told you
because I thought you should know,

424
00:25:15,094 --> 00:25:17,302
but I'm freeing you
of any responsibility.

425
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,510
I'm following my family's tradition.

426
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:23,344
I'll be a single mother, like my mother,
and my grandmother.

427
00:25:23,552 --> 00:25:25,761
Janis, please.

428
00:25:27,094 --> 00:25:30,385
At least consider the possibility
of not having it now.

429
00:25:30,761 --> 00:25:32,928
We can plan it for the future.

430
00:25:33,011 --> 00:25:34,761
But this is the future.

431
00:25:35,886 --> 00:25:38,886
Our relationship
was very clear from the start,

432
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:41,552
no commitments,
on your part or mine.

433
00:25:41,636 --> 00:25:45,552
I don't regret anything,
I've been very happy with you.

434
00:25:45,636 --> 00:25:47,677
So have I,
that's why I want to protect this.

435
00:25:50,969 --> 00:25:54,511
I don't think our relationship
is strong enough to survive this.

436
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:55,594
What do you suggest?

437
00:26:00,636 --> 00:26:02,886
That we separate,

438
00:26:02,969 --> 00:26:04,302
with no hard feelings.

439
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,719
The baby is my concern,

440
00:26:06,802 --> 00:26:09,719
but to cope with this
we'll stop seeing each other.

441
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:10,802
Don't say that.

442
00:26:12,344 --> 00:26:14,886
If we keep in touch,
we'll keep screwing

443
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:18,302
and in a few months we'll end up
having the same conversation.

444
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,260
It's better to end it now.

445
00:26:26,094 --> 00:26:27,969
Hello.

446
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:30,594
It's been a long time!

447
00:26:30,844 --> 00:26:33,219
I've lost all notion of time.

448
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:37,761
-Here, for both of you.
-Thank you.

449
00:26:37,844 --> 00:26:38,969
It's cute.

450
00:26:39,053 --> 00:26:41,928
I was waiting for you to call,
but as you didn't, here I am.

451
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:43,969
Can I see her?

452
00:26:44,552 --> 00:26:47,135
-Yes, she's asleep.
-I won't wake her.

453
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:48,135
-Come on.
-Thank you.

454
00:26:54,053 --> 00:26:55,677
Look.

455
00:26:57,969 --> 00:26:59,844
-Can I touch her?
-Of course.

456
00:27:09,677 --> 00:27:11,344
She's going to be very dark like you.

457
00:27:11,552 --> 00:27:12,928
Yes, she's very dark.

458
00:27:14,969 --> 00:27:17,011
Who do you think she looks like?

459
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,552
I think she's got my father's features.

460
00:27:21,636 --> 00:27:23,344
I thought you never knew him.

461
00:27:23,552 --> 00:27:26,636
I didn't,
I'd have been a few months old.

462
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:30,844
My grandmother said he was Venezuelan,
with almond-shaped eyes.

463
00:27:31,469 --> 00:27:33,135
The same eyes.

464
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:34,844
Yes...

465
00:27:34,928 --> 00:27:37,469
She's going to be very pretty.

466
00:27:39,219 --> 00:27:40,677
Well...

467
00:27:41,302 --> 00:27:43,886
And how are you?

468
00:27:43,969 --> 00:27:48,053
Fine.
With a lot of work, like always.

469
00:27:51,552 --> 00:27:54,135
Are you all organized?
Do you need anything?

470
00:27:54,219 --> 00:27:57,928
I've got an au-pair
who helps me with the baby

471
00:27:58,011 --> 00:28:00,803
and I saved enough
to take a few months off.

472
00:28:00,886 --> 00:28:03,844
-I can't be away from her now.
-Of course.

473
00:28:04,177 --> 00:28:05,636
Would you like a drink?

474
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:08,094
No, I've got a very early start.

475
00:28:08,803 --> 00:28:12,052
I just wanted to see you both
for a minute. I'm off now.

476
00:28:16,886 --> 00:28:18,219
Well...

477
00:28:18,302 --> 00:28:19,844
She's beautiful.

478
00:28:20,386 --> 00:28:22,177
You've done a good job.

479
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,719
Thank you.

480
00:28:30,427 --> 00:28:31,844
I'm working in the morning.

481
00:28:31,928 --> 00:28:34,177
In the afternoon I'll be in the hotel,
the usual one.

482
00:28:34,678 --> 00:28:36,511
Call me if you want.

483
00:28:36,594 --> 00:28:38,386
OK, so long.

484
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:39,594
Goodbye.

485
00:28:58,886 --> 00:29:00,552
Hello.

486
00:29:00,761 --> 00:29:02,052
Come in.

487
00:29:07,302 --> 00:29:09,094
Give me a second,
I'm sending an e-mail.

488
00:29:09,177 --> 00:29:10,344
OK.

489
00:29:14,594 --> 00:29:15,969
Sit down.

490
00:29:19,761 --> 00:29:21,552
That's it.

491
00:29:21,636 --> 00:29:23,386
-Would you like anything?
-No.

492
00:29:26,219 --> 00:29:28,511
I'm listening.

493
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:32,761
Since the baby was born,

494
00:29:32,844 --> 00:29:35,386
I'd been looking forward to your visit,

495
00:29:35,594 --> 00:29:37,260
even though we'd decided to separate.

496
00:29:37,344 --> 00:29:38,636
You decided that.

497
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:41,135
Yes, I decided that.

498
00:29:41,511 --> 00:29:44,094
But I imagined you'd be curious
to see your daughter.

499
00:29:44,177 --> 00:29:45,552
I was.

500
00:29:46,469 --> 00:29:49,260
I've been struggling all these months
not to call you

501
00:29:49,344 --> 00:29:51,302
until I couldn't take it anymore.

502
00:29:51,511 --> 00:29:55,177
I was so excited
about seeing her and seeing you.

503
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,511
So what happened last night?
And don't tell me that nothing happened.

504
00:29:59,844 --> 00:30:01,969
I think the baby isn't mine.

505
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:04,427
What?

506
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:07,052
I didn't recognize her.

507
00:30:08,636 --> 00:30:10,803
-What does that mean?
-It's what I felt.

508
00:30:12,427 --> 00:30:14,636
What you're saying
isn't very scientific.

509
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:16,386
I don't think she's my daughter.

510
00:30:16,927 --> 00:30:18,844
You mean it's another man's?

511
00:30:18,927 --> 00:30:20,094
I don't know. You tell me.

512
00:30:20,302 --> 00:30:24,511
During the time we were together
you were the only man I slept with.

513
00:30:24,594 --> 00:30:27,052
Do you really think
the baby takes after your father?

514
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:28,219
You know I never met him.

515
00:30:28,302 --> 00:30:30,844
I only know what my grandmother said
and she never met him.

516
00:30:30,927 --> 00:30:32,719
Do you have any photos of him?

517
00:30:32,803 --> 00:30:34,552
No, I don't.

518
00:30:36,344 --> 00:30:39,135
If I'd wanted to fool you
about your paternity,

519
00:30:39,219 --> 00:30:41,344
why would I have asked
that we separate?

520
00:30:41,553 --> 00:30:44,094
If I'd intended to lie
I'd have stayed with you.

521
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:47,344
When we split up
I didn't ask you for anything!

522
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:48,553
Why would I fool you now?

523
00:30:48,636 --> 00:30:50,052
I don't understand it either.

524
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,927
To end my doubts,

525
00:30:55,927 --> 00:30:57,844
let me do a paternity test.

526
00:30:57,927 --> 00:30:58,844
No.

527
00:30:58,927 --> 00:30:59,885
Janis, please.

528
00:31:02,803 --> 00:31:04,969
It's best if I leave.

529
00:31:07,885 --> 00:31:09,052
Don't call me again.

530
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:11,844
If there's any news about the grave,
someone else can call me.

531
00:31:11,927 --> 00:31:14,469
I'm sorry we still have
that matter in common.

532
00:31:14,553 --> 00:31:17,135
We're adults.
We don't have to mix things.

533
00:31:17,219 --> 00:31:18,844
And stop thinking about your pride.

534
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:21,344
If there are doubts,
the only answer is to do the test.

535
00:31:21,553 --> 00:31:23,219
-I have no doubts.
-But I do.

536
00:31:23,302 --> 00:31:25,386
Very well.

537
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:26,803
Janis!

538
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,344
What'll I do with this foot?

539
00:31:37,553 --> 00:31:40,803
I'm going to eat this foot.

540
00:31:44,261 --> 00:31:45,344
<i>Yes?</i>

541
00:31:45,553 --> 00:31:47,344
Janis, it's Ana.

542
00:31:47,553 --> 00:31:48,636
Ana who?

543
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:50,261
<i>We had our babies together.</i>

544
00:31:51,427 --> 00:31:53,678
Oh, Ana!

545
00:31:53,761 --> 00:31:55,177
Forgive me, love.

546
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:57,761
I had a fight with my baby's father
and I'm furious.

547
00:31:57,844 --> 00:31:59,885
I thought he was out of the picture.

548
00:31:59,969 --> 00:32:01,427
<i>He really is!</i>

549
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:03,261
This won't happen again.

550
00:32:04,219 --> 00:32:06,094
How are you, and Anita?

551
00:32:06,177 --> 00:32:09,052
She's right here, I'm changing her.

552
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:11,885
She's wonderful, really.

553
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:14,261
What? What are you saying?

554
00:32:14,344 --> 00:32:15,427
<i>I hear her.</i>

555
00:32:15,927 --> 00:32:18,302
I'm a bit tired, to be honest.

556
00:32:18,386 --> 00:32:20,678
I need more sleep, but I'm fine.

557
00:32:20,761 --> 00:32:22,553
Doesn't your mother help you?

558
00:32:22,636 --> 00:32:23,969
Oh, my mother...

559
00:32:24,052 --> 00:32:26,094
My mother comes and goes.

560
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:28,177
She's in the provinces now

561
00:32:28,261 --> 00:32:31,761
on a tour with
<i>Doña Rosita the Spinster.</i>

562
00:32:32,302 --> 00:32:33,469
What are you saying?

563
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:36,052
Haven't you got a nanny?

564
00:32:36,136 --> 00:32:39,010
Yes, and the maid helps me out too.

565
00:32:41,719 --> 00:32:43,802
You were right.

566
00:32:44,386 --> 00:32:48,386
Anita is a gift,
she's all that matters to me.

567
00:32:48,469 --> 00:32:49,636
<i>Of course.</i>

568
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:51,927
And how is yours?

569
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,010
I think she's beautiful.

570
00:32:54,094 --> 00:32:56,969
I'll come and see you
and they can meet each other.

571
00:32:57,052 --> 00:32:58,927
I'd love that.

572
00:32:59,969 --> 00:33:01,678
Listen, I have to go now.

573
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,594
Call me whenever you want.

574
00:33:04,678 --> 00:33:08,010
I'm delighted to hear from you,
even if you're angry with that man.

575
00:33:08,094 --> 00:33:10,927
Kisses, 'bye.

576
00:33:15,553 --> 00:33:17,636
Now, my love, go to sleep.

577
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:19,760
I'm going to the hospital.

578
00:33:19,844 --> 00:33:21,261
The washing machine's on.

579
00:33:21,344 --> 00:33:24,052
When the duchess gets here,
tell her to hang out the clothes.

580
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:25,802
-I can iron them tomorrow.
-Yes.

581
00:33:26,219 --> 00:33:27,261
How is he?

582
00:33:27,344 --> 00:33:28,760
It doesn't look good.

583
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,760
Yes, my love, yes...

584
00:33:34,678 --> 00:33:35,927
You have to sleep.

585
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:50,469
DNA TESTING KIT

586
00:33:50,553 --> 00:33:51,428
MATERNITY TEST

587
00:33:53,553 --> 00:33:55,594
PERSONS TO GIVE BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES

588
00:33:58,927 --> 00:34:00,636
MOTHER

589
00:34:01,553 --> 00:34:02,553
DAUGHTER

590
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:34,677
-How's the website going?
-Very well.

591
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,593
-And how's the audience today?
-3,000 and rising.

592
00:34:37,677 --> 00:34:38,843
Great.

593
00:34:39,386 --> 00:34:40,760
Excuse me a moment.

594
00:34:41,885 --> 00:34:42,719
Yes, Janis.

595
00:34:42,801 --> 00:34:44,969
Do you have a minute?

596
00:34:45,052 --> 00:34:46,135
<i>No, but go ahead.</i>

597
00:34:47,344 --> 00:34:49,386
I'm going back to work.

598
00:34:49,926 --> 00:34:54,386
<i>I don't like the au pair girl.
I want to hire a proper babysitter.</i>

599
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:57,885
If you need money, I can help you out.

600
00:34:58,469 --> 00:35:00,760
Thanks, Elena, but I need to work.

601
00:35:01,094 --> 00:35:03,927
Is there anything immediate
in your supplement?

602
00:35:04,011 --> 00:35:05,844
Nothing immediate.

603
00:35:06,386 --> 00:35:08,927
The big stuff is already allocated.
What's left?

604
00:35:09,635 --> 00:35:11,677
Still lifes of accessories.

605
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,635
<i>Shoes, jewelry, a few belts...
Nothing else.</i>

606
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:18,844
I'd be delighted to photograph
shoes and belts.

607
00:35:18,927 --> 00:35:21,469
You're too good
a photographer for that.

608
00:35:22,052 --> 00:35:23,344
I need to work.

609
00:35:23,885 --> 00:35:28,052
If it's not outside of Madrid,
I'll do still lifes of anything.

610
00:35:28,136 --> 00:35:29,344
<i>I don't mind.</i>

611
00:35:29,553 --> 00:35:32,844
I'll come and see you about it,
and see the baby as well.

612
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:34,760
I was thinking

613
00:35:34,844 --> 00:35:37,553
that you two could move in
with me for a while.

614
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,885
I've got lots of space,
there's the garden...

615
00:35:40,635 --> 00:35:42,177
<i>We can keep each other company.</i>

616
00:35:42,261 --> 00:35:45,177
Thank you,
but it would be a real upheaval,

617
00:35:45,261 --> 00:35:46,469
and it's far away.

618
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,885
I'm very well organized here.

619
00:35:48,969 --> 00:35:49,885
OK.

620
00:35:49,969 --> 00:35:51,261
I'll see you later.

621
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:53,969
Do you need anything?

622
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:55,386
No, thank you.

623
00:35:59,386 --> 00:36:01,386
I can't stand her, I swear.

624
00:36:02,844 --> 00:36:04,344
She's enjoying it.

625
00:36:05,303 --> 00:36:06,386
Let's get out,

626
00:36:06,594 --> 00:36:09,177
so you don't catch cold.

627
00:36:18,052 --> 00:36:21,927
What a lovely little baby.

628
00:36:23,886 --> 00:36:25,802
She's getting more ethnic, eh?

629
00:36:26,261 --> 00:36:27,844
She's like your father.

630
00:36:27,927 --> 00:36:29,261
Exactly like him!

631
00:36:30,303 --> 00:36:31,594
I don't know what he was like.

632
00:36:31,677 --> 00:36:33,094
Wasn't he Colombian?

633
00:36:33,177 --> 00:36:37,886
Venezuelan. A dealer, my grandmother said,
but who knows?

634
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:40,011
I thought you were sure.

635
00:36:40,094 --> 00:36:41,303
No.

636
00:36:41,386 --> 00:36:45,386
Who else could she look like,
apart from the anthropologist?

637
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,594
Because she doesn't look like him.

638
00:36:47,677 --> 00:36:48,552
No!

639
00:36:49,094 --> 00:36:50,886
I only slept with Arturo.

640
00:36:50,969 --> 00:36:53,219
Then she looks like your father,
that's it.

641
00:36:54,136 --> 00:36:56,510
Right, Cecilia?
You're like your Venezuelan grandfather.

642
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,386
I'm off.

643
00:37:03,594 --> 00:37:06,261
I'll see you tomorrow in the office
about the photos.

644
00:37:06,344 --> 00:37:07,802
Something will come up.

645
00:37:08,635 --> 00:37:11,052
And think about coming to my house.

646
00:37:11,136 --> 00:37:12,094
No.

647
00:37:12,178 --> 00:37:13,802
You're so stubborn.

648
00:37:15,303 --> 00:37:16,844
See you tomorrow.

649
00:37:28,094 --> 00:37:29,844
What an angel face.

650
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,927
Let's see you pose for mom.

651
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,219
Let's see...

652
00:37:37,303 --> 00:37:38,594
She's getting angry.

653
00:37:39,844 --> 00:37:41,178
What a bad temper.

654
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:43,303
This came for you.

655
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:45,594
Thanks.

656
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:47,927
Look at her, pretty as a piglet.

657
00:37:48,011 --> 00:37:48,969
Thanks!

658
00:37:49,052 --> 00:37:51,594
They said that to me
and see how pretty I turned out.

659
00:37:54,344 --> 00:37:55,719
Labgenetics.

660
00:38:05,261 --> 00:38:07,969
Gloves must be worn.
No smoking.

661
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,886
There can be no organic remains
in the mouth.

662
00:38:15,677 --> 00:38:17,927
We have to leave it for tomorrow.

663
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,261
Darling...

664
00:38:30,635 --> 00:38:31,886
What?

665
00:39:08,886 --> 00:39:10,677
Let's see, little one.

666
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:14,011
This side.

667
00:39:14,094 --> 00:39:15,677
This side, my love.

668
00:39:15,761 --> 00:39:17,677
There, my love, that's it.

669
00:39:17,761 --> 00:39:20,635
So that we can both stop worrying.

670
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:08,844
REPORT ON BIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION
OF MATERNITY

671
00:40:15,969 --> 00:40:18,136
JANIS MARTÍNEZ IS NOT

672
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:20,886
THE BIOLOGICAL MOTHER OF CECILIA MARTÍNEZ

673
00:40:26,011 --> 00:40:29,594
NOT THE BIOLOGICAL MOTHER

674
00:40:33,594 --> 00:40:36,094
100% PROBABILITY

675
00:41:15,886 --> 00:41:17,844
<i>Méndez Law Firm.</i>

676
00:41:17,928 --> 00:41:21,886
May I speak to the lawyer
Mauricio Méndez?

677
00:41:21,969 --> 00:41:24,260
<i>He's in court now.
May I take a message?</i>

678
00:41:25,427 --> 00:41:27,594
No, I'll call later.

679
00:41:58,094 --> 00:41:59,053
<i>Yes?</i>

680
00:41:59,136 --> 00:42:01,969
May I speak to Ana?
This is Janis.

681
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:06,053
<i>She can't take your call,
she's bathing the baby.</i>

682
00:42:06,136 --> 00:42:07,469
<i>She'll call you later.</i>

683
00:42:08,094 --> 00:42:12,302
It's all right.
I just wanted to ask how the baby was.

684
00:42:12,385 --> 00:42:15,011
<i>She fusses a bit at night</i>

685
00:42:15,094 --> 00:42:18,844
<i>but she's beautiful
and Ana is a great mother.</i>

686
00:42:19,844 --> 00:42:21,302
Of course.

687
00:42:21,385 --> 00:42:24,385
Thank you, goodbye.

688
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,219
NOT THE BIOLOGICAL MOTHER

689
00:43:04,177 --> 00:43:05,636
Hello?

690
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:07,761
<i>Hello, Janis. Did you call me?</i>

691
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,177
No.

692
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,928
Maybe by accident,
I've just put it in my purse.

693
00:43:14,302 --> 00:43:17,219
<i>That happens at times...
Are you all right?</i>

694
00:43:18,594 --> 00:43:20,177
I've got a lot going on.

695
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,511
I'm going to get rid of the au pair and...

696
00:43:24,344 --> 00:43:27,094
Domestic problems, nothing important.

697
00:43:27,177 --> 00:43:28,302
<i>You sound upset.</i>

698
00:43:28,969 --> 00:43:33,135
You've got me at a bad time.
I can't talk now, I'm sorry.

699
00:43:33,636 --> 00:43:35,719
Goodbye, Arturo,
and thanks for calling.

700
00:43:36,053 --> 00:43:37,302
<i>'Bye.</i>

701
00:43:45,053 --> 00:43:47,302
I'm sleeping with the baby tonight.

702
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:50,511
Shall I help you?

703
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:53,302
No, I'll move her.

704
00:44:01,928 --> 00:44:04,886
Come to mommy.

705
00:44:41,677 --> 00:44:43,177
I love the color.

706
00:44:44,511 --> 00:44:45,636
Our pleasure.

707
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:46,969
Hello.

708
00:44:47,052 --> 00:44:48,469
I'd like to change my number.

709
00:44:48,677 --> 00:44:49,969
What phone do you have?

710
00:44:50,052 --> 00:44:50,969
This one.

711
00:44:51,886 --> 00:44:54,094
But I'd like to keep
all that's on this one.

712
00:44:54,177 --> 00:44:55,011
No problem.

713
00:44:55,094 --> 00:44:56,344
-You're sure?
-Yes.

714
00:45:10,219 --> 00:45:12,011
The earphones again!

715
00:45:15,386 --> 00:45:18,052
I've told you 1,000 times
to put her on her side!

716
00:45:18,135 --> 00:45:19,719
If she vomits, she could choke!

717
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,260
Come here, my love.

718
00:45:25,177 --> 00:45:27,094
Don't you understand what I say?

719
00:45:29,678 --> 00:45:31,886
You've been here for ages
and you've learned nothing.

720
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:33,636
I don't want you to stay on.

721
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:35,219
But I've enrolled.

722
00:45:35,302 --> 00:45:37,302
I don't care. Find another house.

723
00:45:37,386 --> 00:45:39,594
I'm not leaving her with you
for another night!

724
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,511
I've had enough.

725
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:03,719
Hello.

726
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:04,844
Come in.

727
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,803
Here I am with Cecilia.

728
00:46:06,886 --> 00:46:08,302
Hello, Cecilia.

729
00:46:08,386 --> 00:46:10,260
Leave the baby carrier here.

730
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:16,302
Well, darling...

731
00:46:16,386 --> 00:46:19,886
She's a bit cranky,
I've just woken her.

732
00:46:19,969 --> 00:46:21,761
Don't worry.

733
00:46:21,844 --> 00:46:25,344
Aren't you a beautiful baby?

734
00:46:25,427 --> 00:46:28,761
I'm very nervous,
it's the first time we've been separated.

735
00:46:28,844 --> 00:46:32,636
Don't worry,
I'll be watching her the whole time.

736
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:34,094
This'll be like her second home.

737
00:46:35,344 --> 00:46:38,511
Here... That's it.

738
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,469
Do you leave her on the floor?

739
00:46:48,678 --> 00:46:49,761
Yes.

740
00:46:49,844 --> 00:46:52,803
You mustn't force any position,
she'll decide what's best.

741
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:56,219
I've brought what you asked for.

742
00:46:56,302 --> 00:47:00,969
The wipes, a change, the bottles...

743
00:47:02,344 --> 00:47:06,219
The cream and... that's it.

744
00:47:06,302 --> 00:47:07,302
Perfect.

745
00:47:08,386 --> 00:47:10,302
And you've got my number.

746
00:47:10,386 --> 00:47:11,386
Great.

747
00:47:12,636 --> 00:47:13,803
Darling.

748
00:47:14,386 --> 00:47:15,886
Yes, my love.

749
00:47:15,969 --> 00:47:19,803
I'll come and get my little mouse later.

750
00:47:20,511 --> 00:47:22,052
I love you.

751
00:47:22,969 --> 00:47:24,177
Thank you.

752
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:26,177
I'll see you later.

753
00:47:35,761 --> 00:47:37,135
Excuse me.

754
00:47:43,678 --> 00:47:46,094
I've got a little girl.

755
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:26,969
What can I get you?

756
00:48:27,469 --> 00:48:28,302
Hello.

757
00:48:28,386 --> 00:48:30,844
Coffee with milk and a blueberry muffin.

758
00:48:33,761 --> 00:48:35,177
Ana?

759
00:48:35,261 --> 00:48:37,302
-Are you Ana?
-Yes, Janis, it's me.

760
00:48:37,386 --> 00:48:38,511
What are you doing here?

761
00:48:38,594 --> 00:48:40,052
I work here.

762
00:48:40,136 --> 00:48:43,052
You've changed so much!
I didn't recognize you.

763
00:48:43,136 --> 00:48:45,010
-You look wonderful.
-Thank you.

764
00:48:45,094 --> 00:48:46,636
I'll bring you the coffee.

765
00:49:03,969 --> 00:49:05,844
May I sit with you for a minute?

766
00:49:05,927 --> 00:49:07,302
Of course.

767
00:49:09,594 --> 00:49:12,136
How long have you been here?
I haven't seen you.

768
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:13,719
Almost a week.

769
00:49:14,261 --> 00:49:17,261
So we're neighbors.
What a coincidence.

770
00:49:17,344 --> 00:49:21,177
To be honest,
I came to your house,

771
00:49:21,802 --> 00:49:24,219
but then I felt silly
and didn't buzz you.

772
00:49:24,302 --> 00:49:25,885
I came in here to have something

773
00:49:26,386 --> 00:49:28,844
and the head waiter offered me a job.

774
00:49:28,927 --> 00:49:30,386
Well, I asked too.

775
00:49:30,678 --> 00:49:33,094
And now I've got a room in his house.

776
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,052
And your mother?

777
00:49:35,136 --> 00:49:37,428
She's in Barcelona now, doing theater.

778
00:49:37,636 --> 00:49:39,219
She never stops.

779
00:49:39,302 --> 00:49:40,844
She's finally a success.

780
00:49:42,136 --> 00:49:43,678
She left you on your own?

781
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,678
Yes, I call her occasionally

782
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,969
but I still haven't told her
I've moved out

783
00:49:48,052 --> 00:49:50,094
and I've forbidden Clarissa
to tell her.

784
00:49:50,177 --> 00:49:52,844
When she comes back
she'll get a big surprise.

785
00:49:52,927 --> 00:49:53,885
So you ran away.

786
00:49:54,802 --> 00:49:58,386
I'm an adult and I'm just a burden to her.

787
00:49:58,469 --> 00:49:59,511
And your father?

788
00:49:59,594 --> 00:50:01,428
He still has no idea.

789
00:50:01,636 --> 00:50:03,802
What a family scene!

790
00:50:03,885 --> 00:50:05,094
I'm used to it.

791
00:50:05,177 --> 00:50:09,302
I'm broke, but for the first time
I'm in control of my life.

792
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:10,802
I'll do OK.

793
00:50:11,511 --> 00:50:12,927
I'm sure.

794
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,636
I can't stay,
I've got a taxi waiting.

795
00:50:16,302 --> 00:50:17,136
Wait.

796
00:50:17,386 --> 00:50:18,719
Don't worry, my treat.

797
00:50:19,177 --> 00:50:20,052
Yes?

798
00:50:20,136 --> 00:50:21,219
Thank you.

799
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:26,844
What time do you finish?

800
00:50:26,927 --> 00:50:28,636
Today, at 9:00.

801
00:50:29,594 --> 00:50:33,386
Shall we meet at my place?
You've got the address.

802
00:50:33,594 --> 00:50:34,678
Sure.

803
00:50:35,511 --> 00:50:36,844
I'm delighted to see you.

804
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,094
Same here.

805
00:50:38,177 --> 00:50:39,094
Goodbye.

806
00:50:39,177 --> 00:50:40,927
Thank you for the coffee and...

807
00:50:52,969 --> 00:50:53,969
Good morning.

808
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:56,011
Where are we going?

809
00:50:56,469 --> 00:50:59,011
17, Quintiliano Street.

810
00:50:59,261 --> 00:51:00,677
We're on our way.

811
00:51:16,177 --> 00:51:17,927
Hello.

812
00:51:18,302 --> 00:51:20,386
Thank you for inviting me.

813
00:51:22,802 --> 00:51:24,261
What a lovely home!

814
00:51:24,344 --> 00:51:25,760
Thank you.

815
00:51:25,844 --> 00:51:30,011
This morning, with the rush,
I didn't ask about your daughter.

816
00:51:30,428 --> 00:51:33,927
How do you manage with her
now that you're working?

817
00:51:34,511 --> 00:51:38,219
Do you leave her in a nursery?
You have long hours.

818
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,927
What is it?

819
00:51:41,177 --> 00:51:42,635
Are you all right?

820
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:44,136
Anita died.

821
00:51:48,344 --> 00:51:50,011
Don't tell me that.

822
00:52:02,885 --> 00:52:05,011
But she looks so well.

823
00:52:05,094 --> 00:52:06,428
What happened?

824
00:52:09,052 --> 00:52:11,052
A crib death.

825
00:52:11,677 --> 00:52:13,261
But from what?

826
00:52:13,594 --> 00:52:15,885
A crib death,
that's what it's called.

827
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:19,969
She died in her sleep.

828
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:24,469
What symptoms did she have?

829
00:52:25,011 --> 00:52:26,428
None.

830
00:52:28,802 --> 00:52:30,844
She was perfect.

831
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:35,511
Her brain forgot to breathe.

832
00:52:38,927 --> 00:52:41,677
Cerebral immaturity, the doctor said.

833
00:52:44,677 --> 00:52:46,136
Immaturity?

834
00:52:47,469 --> 00:52:51,969
During the first year, apparently,
a baby's brain isn't developed

835
00:52:53,344 --> 00:52:55,844
and it can forget
to give the order to breathe.

836
00:52:57,886 --> 00:53:00,760
Can't anything be done to prevent it?

837
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,052
No, it's a very rare case.

838
00:53:03,969 --> 00:53:06,719
It happens once in a million times.

839
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:10,552
But Anita was perfect, you saw that.

840
00:53:10,635 --> 00:53:12,386
Excuse me.

841
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:28,511
She's beautiful.

842
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,510
Do you want to see her?

843
00:53:34,178 --> 00:53:35,303
Please.

844
00:53:36,802 --> 00:53:38,886
How was your siesta, my love?

845
00:53:38,969 --> 00:53:41,802
A friend has come.

846
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:44,052
-May I pick her up?
-Of course.

847
00:53:44,136 --> 00:53:46,094
Will you come with me?

848
00:53:46,178 --> 00:53:49,428
You are so beautiful.

849
00:53:49,635 --> 00:53:51,469
She's so big.

850
00:53:53,428 --> 00:53:55,802
Aren't you pretty!

851
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:58,844
Hang on.

852
00:54:00,844 --> 00:54:01,927
Yes?

853
00:54:02,011 --> 00:54:05,094
<i>I'm the café manager.
I was to meet Ana.</i>

854
00:54:05,178 --> 00:54:07,094
I'll tell her now.

855
00:54:07,594 --> 00:54:08,844
Ana!

856
00:54:09,677 --> 00:54:12,802
It's the café manager,
he's waiting downstairs.

857
00:54:12,886 --> 00:54:14,386
That's right, I have to go.

858
00:54:14,594 --> 00:54:16,635
She'll be down now.

859
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:24,219
-She's a wonderful child.
-Thank you.

860
00:54:25,386 --> 00:54:28,386
Could you send me
that photo of Anita?

861
00:54:28,469 --> 00:54:29,635
Of course,

862
00:54:29,719 --> 00:54:31,719
but you've changed your number.

863
00:54:31,802 --> 00:54:33,386
I've called you lots of times and...

864
00:54:33,594 --> 00:54:36,011
I'll write it down for you now.

865
00:54:36,303 --> 00:54:37,844
I'll get my backpack.

866
00:54:49,469 --> 00:54:50,719
Here it is.

867
00:54:50,802 --> 00:54:52,136
I'll send it to you now.

868
00:54:56,469 --> 00:54:58,261
I'm so sorry, Ana.

869
00:54:58,927 --> 00:55:00,052
Really.

870
00:55:00,969 --> 00:55:02,219
Thank you.

871
00:55:09,052 --> 00:55:10,886
Well...

872
00:55:10,969 --> 00:55:12,052
Goodbye, love.

873
00:55:12,136 --> 00:55:13,510
Goodbye.

874
00:55:16,761 --> 00:55:18,094
Goodbye, Ana.

875
00:55:21,844 --> 00:55:24,052
Come here, my love.

876
00:55:52,594 --> 00:55:55,927
I'll see you at my place at 9:00.

877
00:55:56,677 --> 00:55:59,178
OK, Ana.

878
00:55:59,261 --> 00:56:00,469
'Bye.

879
00:56:02,136 --> 00:56:03,344
Everything all right?

880
00:56:03,886 --> 00:56:04,969
Yes.

881
00:56:05,844 --> 00:56:07,385
You seem worried.

882
00:56:07,469 --> 00:56:09,385
We're running late.

883
00:56:09,594 --> 00:56:11,094
I'll see if Dana's ready.

884
00:56:11,178 --> 00:56:14,261
If I skip tonight's event,
we could have dinner together.

885
00:56:14,344 --> 00:56:15,886
No, I can't tonight.

886
00:56:15,969 --> 00:56:17,802
I'm going to shake them up.

887
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:21,677
How do I look?

888
00:56:21,761 --> 00:56:23,844
It'll be easy to show
how beautiful you are.

889
00:56:23,927 --> 00:56:26,011
I'm a bit nervous.

890
00:56:26,094 --> 00:56:27,969
It'll be very easy.

891
00:56:28,053 --> 00:56:31,969
You know it's my first time
on the cover of a women's magazine?

892
00:56:32,053 --> 00:56:34,261
It was about time!

893
00:56:35,261 --> 00:56:39,094
If you like, we can start lying down.

894
00:56:39,178 --> 00:56:41,886
If you're uncomfortable about anything,
tell me.

895
00:56:42,136 --> 00:56:43,261
Like this?

896
00:56:43,344 --> 00:56:45,178
Like that, very good to start with.

897
00:56:46,303 --> 00:56:47,969
I love how that looks on you.

898
00:56:49,761 --> 00:56:52,094
You just keep moving around,
as you wish,

899
00:56:52,178 --> 00:56:53,510
however you're comfortable.

900
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:00,552
Very good.

901
00:57:01,427 --> 00:57:02,636
Yes, stay like that.

902
00:57:03,344 --> 00:57:04,886
Perfect.

903
00:57:08,094 --> 00:57:09,053
Very good.

904
00:57:26,594 --> 00:57:27,844
It's Ana.

905
00:57:37,261 --> 00:57:39,011
Hello.

906
00:57:39,094 --> 00:57:40,719
How are you?

907
00:57:40,802 --> 00:57:42,802
I'm making a potato omelet.

908
00:57:42,886 --> 00:57:44,302
Will you help me?

909
00:57:46,844 --> 00:57:48,094
Where's Cecilia?

910
00:57:48,178 --> 00:57:49,802
I've just got her to sleep.

911
00:57:50,219 --> 00:57:52,178
You can see her later.

912
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,844
Have you ever peeled potatoes?

913
00:57:54,594 --> 00:57:57,802
No, I've peeled oranges, apples...

914
00:57:57,886 --> 00:58:01,427
It isn't the same,
take this and watch me.

915
00:58:02,219 --> 00:58:03,469
You see?

916
00:58:05,636 --> 00:58:07,053
Like this.

917
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:09,594
-It's easy.
-Very easy.

918
00:58:10,427 --> 00:58:13,053
Now you wash them,
go on.

919
00:58:13,761 --> 00:58:15,427
Shake them,

920
00:58:15,636 --> 00:58:17,469
to get rid of the grit.

921
00:58:20,094 --> 00:58:22,969
The most important thing
is how you cut them.

922
00:58:23,053 --> 00:58:24,928
Take that pink knife.

923
00:58:29,802 --> 00:58:32,886
What's important
is the thickness of each slice.

924
00:58:32,969 --> 00:58:34,094
The thickness.

925
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:35,219
Look.

926
00:58:38,011 --> 00:58:39,260
Like this, very fine.

927
00:58:39,344 --> 00:58:41,011
Without cutting yourself.

928
00:58:45,344 --> 00:58:47,053
How much do they pay you at the bar?

929
00:58:48,427 --> 00:58:50,219
500 euros plus tips.

930
00:58:52,344 --> 00:58:55,385
I was thinking that Dolores
might be leaving me soon.

931
00:58:55,469 --> 00:58:56,969
Her husband is very ill.

932
00:58:57,053 --> 00:59:00,677
If I want to keep working,
I'll have to find someone.

933
00:59:00,761 --> 00:59:01,677
Of course.

934
00:59:02,344 --> 00:59:04,427
I could give you 800 euros,

935
00:59:04,636 --> 00:59:06,969
without tips, but with room and board.

936
00:59:07,719 --> 00:59:09,928
Are you asking me to work here?

937
00:59:11,136 --> 00:59:12,177
Yes.

938
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,136
What do I have to do?

939
00:59:14,427 --> 00:59:16,886
Look after Cecilia and the house.

940
00:59:16,969 --> 00:59:19,260
Take her to and from daycare.

941
00:59:19,469 --> 00:59:23,011
Look after her at night,
because I'm really exhausted.

942
00:59:23,094 --> 00:59:25,552
I'll give you a hand
when I'm free.

943
00:59:25,761 --> 00:59:28,677
Of course, it's a deal.

944
00:59:29,469 --> 00:59:32,053
Think about it, it isn't any favor.

945
00:59:32,136 --> 00:59:34,302
I'm almost taking advantage of you.

946
00:59:34,385 --> 00:59:36,427
No, I don't need to think.

947
00:59:36,636 --> 00:59:39,219
I'd love to do it.

948
00:59:40,802 --> 00:59:42,177
Isn't it beautiful!

949
00:59:48,511 --> 00:59:51,761
I don't know if I'm prepared
for what you're asking.

950
00:59:54,135 --> 00:59:57,260
I'll teach you
how to run a house and cook.

951
00:59:57,344 --> 01:00:00,302
But right now I really need you
to look after Cecilia.

952
01:00:01,803 --> 01:00:02,928
OK.

953
01:00:04,761 --> 01:00:08,053
If you don't like it,
you can go back to the bar.

954
01:00:08,135 --> 01:00:11,719
But you have to commit
to at least a week.

955
01:00:12,011 --> 01:00:14,969
I'm delighted, really.

956
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:18,886
Look at that beautiful girl.

957
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:29,219
And she likes you.

958
01:00:29,886 --> 01:00:32,677
She's so cute, and so good.

959
01:00:35,177 --> 01:00:37,053
Good.

960
01:00:37,135 --> 01:00:40,302
Very good, my love.

961
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:42,427
What about your mother?

962
01:00:43,427 --> 01:00:45,469
I told her I've moved out.

963
01:00:45,677 --> 01:00:48,011
-She was stunned.
-I can imagine.

964
01:00:49,011 --> 01:00:50,552
She flipped.

965
01:00:51,094 --> 01:00:53,011
She was furious with me.

966
01:00:53,094 --> 01:00:55,094
I'm not surprised,
she's your mother.

967
01:00:55,177 --> 01:00:56,928
She went off on a tour

968
01:00:57,011 --> 01:00:59,427
when I was in the middle
of a depression.

969
01:01:04,177 --> 01:01:05,677
I was in a terrible place,

970
01:01:05,761 --> 01:01:07,719
but now I want to live.

971
01:01:07,969 --> 01:01:10,677
It's the only lesson
I've learned from my mother.

972
01:01:11,219 --> 01:01:13,344
Live my life and be free.

973
01:01:15,511 --> 01:01:17,803
It's what she's always done.

974
01:01:19,928 --> 01:01:23,427
And I rang my father to tell him
I'm staying in Madrid to work.

975
01:01:23,511 --> 01:01:24,427
What did he say?

976
01:01:26,886 --> 01:01:30,094
He was really pissed,
but I don't care.

977
01:01:31,011 --> 01:01:33,928
I might change my number
so I won't have to listen to him.

978
01:01:37,302 --> 01:01:39,928
Will you unplug the camera?

979
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:56,177
Wait, I'll help you.

980
01:02:00,844 --> 01:02:03,094
Put your things in the closet.

981
01:02:09,469 --> 01:02:11,969
I have a co-sleeping crib too,

982
01:02:12,052 --> 01:02:14,427
and a little stroller.

983
01:02:15,386 --> 01:02:17,094
Well, I've got everything.

984
01:02:17,177 --> 01:02:20,135
If you want anything,
I can get it from my mother's house.

985
01:02:20,219 --> 01:02:21,636
I have the keys.

986
01:02:22,219 --> 01:02:23,636
Thank you.

987
01:02:24,427 --> 01:02:26,761
-Do you have a bouncy chair?
-No.

988
01:02:26,844 --> 01:02:28,552
They love that.

989
01:02:28,636 --> 01:02:30,260
My Anita really enjoyed it.

990
01:02:31,511 --> 01:02:34,427
It probably still has her smell.

991
01:02:38,469 --> 01:02:40,094
That's true,
I hadn't thought about it.

992
01:03:05,678 --> 01:03:07,386
Janis...

993
01:03:07,469 --> 01:03:08,928
Are you all right?

994
01:03:09,302 --> 01:03:10,511
Yes.

995
01:03:16,177 --> 01:03:17,719
I missed her.

996
01:03:18,386 --> 01:03:20,844
-Do you want to take her?
-No.

997
01:03:21,927 --> 01:03:24,594
I have to get used to it,
and to sleeping.

998
01:03:24,678 --> 01:03:26,302
I've missed out on a lot of sleep.

999
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:28,344
Are you sure you're all right?

1000
01:03:28,636 --> 01:03:30,052
You're sweating.

1001
01:03:31,094 --> 01:03:33,844
Lie down here with us
for a while.

1002
01:03:35,719 --> 01:03:37,219
Come on.

1003
01:04:12,261 --> 01:04:14,678
-Have you had breakfast?
-No.

1004
01:04:14,885 --> 01:04:17,135
Have you brushed your teeth?
Or chewed gum?

1005
01:04:17,219 --> 01:04:18,469
No, why?

1006
01:04:18,969 --> 01:04:21,594
I'm going to take
a sample of your saliva.

1007
01:04:21,803 --> 01:04:23,427
Open your mouth.

1008
01:04:23,511 --> 01:04:24,594
More.

1009
01:04:24,678 --> 01:04:26,052
It's for an analysis.

1010
01:04:27,052 --> 01:04:28,594
Is this how they do it now?

1011
01:04:28,803 --> 01:04:32,261
Yes, I'm going to get
a full analysis for you.

1012
01:04:32,344 --> 01:04:33,678
And for Cecilia too.

1013
01:04:35,636 --> 01:04:40,094
And you too, my love.

1014
01:04:47,511 --> 01:04:50,010
You're doing it very well.

1015
01:04:52,511 --> 01:04:54,261
Today you'll go with Dolores

1016
01:04:54,344 --> 01:04:56,969
so you get to know the stores
where she shops

1017
01:04:57,052 --> 01:04:58,844
and what we usually need.

1018
01:04:59,885 --> 01:05:00,844
Sure.

1019
01:05:01,261 --> 01:05:02,885
I'll write everything down.

1020
01:05:02,969 --> 01:05:04,594
I'll be back now.

1021
01:05:38,553 --> 01:05:40,719
We're going now.

1022
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:43,636
I'll leave Cecilia at daycare

1023
01:05:43,844 --> 01:05:46,010
and then we're going shopping.

1024
01:05:46,427 --> 01:05:48,177
A kiss, my love.

1025
01:05:48,261 --> 01:05:50,594
Wave goodbye.

1026
01:05:50,678 --> 01:05:51,969
Have fun.

1027
01:05:52,052 --> 01:05:53,219
'Bye, mom.

1028
01:05:53,302 --> 01:05:54,844
See you later.

1029
01:06:09,553 --> 01:06:12,094
RESULT ON BIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION
OF MATERNITY

1030
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:17,594
ANA MANSO IS THE BIOLOGICAL MOTHER
OF CECILIA MARTÍNEZ

1031
01:06:17,678 --> 01:06:21,553
PROBABILITY 99.9%

1032
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:56,386
Teresa?

1033
01:06:56,469 --> 01:06:57,511
Hello, Janis.

1034
01:06:57,594 --> 01:06:58,844
Is this a bad time?

1035
01:06:58,927 --> 01:07:00,885
I was working.

1036
01:07:00,969 --> 01:07:02,511
I'm sorry, is Ana here?

1037
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:03,760
No.

1038
01:07:03,844 --> 01:07:05,927
They told me in the bar I'd find her here.

1039
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:09,010
She'll be back in a while.
But come in.

1040
01:07:13,428 --> 01:07:16,052
This is my day off
and I came on the train,

1041
01:07:16,136 --> 01:07:18,386
but I've got a show tomorrow in Barcelona.

1042
01:07:18,469 --> 01:07:20,969
Can I get you anything?
A coffee?

1043
01:07:21,052 --> 01:07:22,594
Brandy?

1044
01:07:24,177 --> 01:07:26,677
I think Dolores
keeps something around here.

1045
01:07:27,302 --> 01:07:30,636
At times she drinks
because her husband is very ill.

1046
01:07:30,844 --> 01:07:31,927
Oh, dear.

1047
01:07:34,927 --> 01:07:36,261
Do you smoke?

1048
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:37,927
All right.

1049
01:07:38,428 --> 01:07:39,636
But on the terrace.

1050
01:07:39,844 --> 01:07:40,885
Of course.

1051
01:07:47,469 --> 01:07:49,719
I'll get a jacket, it's cold.

1052
01:08:08,844 --> 01:08:10,927
I don't know what Ana's told you about me.

1053
01:08:12,303 --> 01:08:13,303
Very little.

1054
01:08:19,801 --> 01:08:21,969
I married to get away from my parents.

1055
01:08:22,052 --> 01:08:23,677
A year later Ana was born.

1056
01:08:24,344 --> 01:08:27,386
But I had no calling
to be a mother or a wife.

1057
01:08:27,885 --> 01:08:29,594
I wanted to be in the theater.

1058
01:08:29,677 --> 01:08:31,718
I'd done it at university.

1059
01:08:31,927 --> 01:08:35,634
So I divorced Ana's father
through the Roman Rota.

1060
01:08:35,843 --> 01:08:37,552
You can't imagine that...

1061
01:08:37,635 --> 01:08:39,553
A horrific humiliation.

1062
01:08:40,718 --> 01:08:45,052
You practically had to say you were
a whore so they'd annul your marriage.

1063
01:08:46,136 --> 01:08:48,344
I accepted all the humiliations

1064
01:08:48,428 --> 01:08:51,386
so I could be free
and devote myself to acting.

1065
01:08:52,594 --> 01:08:55,219
Fortunately, money wasn't a problem.

1066
01:08:57,177 --> 01:08:59,635
The father got custody of Ana.

1067
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:03,218
He remarried immediately
and had another family in Granada.

1068
01:09:03,927 --> 01:09:04,969
He's still there.

1069
01:09:06,677 --> 01:09:08,386
But you still saw Ana, didn't you?

1070
01:09:11,344 --> 01:09:13,844
The father took his revenge on me
through Ana.

1071
01:09:14,469 --> 01:09:16,344
He hardly let me see her.

1072
01:09:16,428 --> 01:09:19,219
He put up lots of obstacles
to make me suffer.

1073
01:09:20,011 --> 01:09:23,219
I did small parts
in theater and on television

1074
01:09:23,303 --> 01:09:25,468
and suffered from seeing her so rarely.

1075
01:09:25,553 --> 01:09:27,844
In the end, it wasn't worth
giving her up.

1076
01:09:29,052 --> 01:09:31,011
I started late to be an actress.

1077
01:09:31,094 --> 01:09:33,968
30 is already late for starting

1078
01:09:34,844 --> 01:09:37,886
and looking posh
doesn't help in this profession.

1079
01:09:38,677 --> 01:09:42,718
It isn't a profession for the posh.
Actors are all left wing.

1080
01:09:42,927 --> 01:09:43,886
And what are you?

1081
01:09:43,969 --> 01:09:47,469
I'm apolitical,
my job is to please everyone.

1082
01:09:53,011 --> 01:09:54,885
How did you get Ana back?

1083
01:09:55,219 --> 01:09:57,886
Her father sent her to me
when she got pregnant.

1084
01:09:57,969 --> 01:10:01,594
You could have taken the chance
to win her back.

1085
01:10:01,677 --> 01:10:03,219
Yes.

1086
01:10:04,052 --> 01:10:06,177
But I'm hopeless,

1087
01:10:07,844 --> 01:10:09,303
and it was a bit late.

1088
01:10:10,386 --> 01:10:12,428
Ana was traumatized.

1089
01:10:13,261 --> 01:10:14,677
We were two strangers.

1090
01:10:16,094 --> 01:10:18,052
I did what I could,

1091
01:10:18,136 --> 01:10:20,886
but after a few months
the Lorca came up.

1092
01:10:21,844 --> 01:10:24,552
Immediately after,
the opposite character,

1093
01:10:24,635 --> 01:10:27,594
the junky mother in
<i>Long Day's Journey Into Night.</i>

1094
01:10:27,677 --> 01:10:30,011
I couldn't say no.

1095
01:10:30,594 --> 01:10:32,552
I'm 47,

1096
01:10:32,635 --> 01:10:36,469
and I had to grab the chance
to prove that I'm not an intruder,

1097
01:10:36,886 --> 01:10:39,261
that I'm an actress with talent.

1098
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:44,719
I was the worst mother in the world,

1099
01:10:44,927 --> 01:10:46,011
I know.

1100
01:10:46,469 --> 01:10:47,719
I'm not like you.

1101
01:10:47,802 --> 01:10:50,178
I don't have a maternal instinct.

1102
01:10:51,802 --> 01:10:52,927
It sounds terrible.

1103
01:10:54,844 --> 01:10:56,719
I'm sorry for Ana,

1104
01:10:57,219 --> 01:10:59,844
she was very unfortunate
with both of us,

1105
01:10:59,927 --> 01:11:01,386
her father and me.

1106
01:11:02,386 --> 01:11:04,844
No one deserves
what she's been through.

1107
01:11:06,802 --> 01:11:09,219
When Anita died,

1108
01:11:09,303 --> 01:11:11,552
I was doing a season in Madrid.

1109
01:11:12,261 --> 01:11:16,386
But after a month I had to leave,
and it broke my heart.

1110
01:11:17,261 --> 01:11:18,719
Honestly,

1111
01:11:18,969 --> 01:11:21,552
I left because Ana didn't seem
to care if I did.

1112
01:11:26,094 --> 01:11:30,635
Do you think that the baby died
because of the situation you were in?

1113
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:31,844
No!

1114
01:11:32,552 --> 01:11:33,927
Didn't Ana tell you?

1115
01:11:34,219 --> 01:11:36,677
A crib death, the doctor said.

1116
01:11:36,886 --> 01:11:38,969
An hour before, she was normal.

1117
01:11:39,802 --> 01:11:41,802
Ours isn't exactly a model family,

1118
01:11:42,677 --> 01:11:44,927
but Anita never wanted for anything.

1119
01:11:45,552 --> 01:11:48,427
Ana never left her daughter,
day or night.

1120
01:11:50,635 --> 01:11:52,510
Ana really surprised me.

1121
01:11:54,178 --> 01:11:57,552
After she gave birth
she suddenly became a grown woman,

1122
01:11:58,635 --> 01:12:00,719
responsible.

1123
01:12:01,719 --> 01:12:04,178
The baby never wanted for anything.

1124
01:12:05,719 --> 01:12:08,178
Maybe that's why I allowed myself...

1125
01:12:09,178 --> 01:12:10,969
We're back!

1126
01:12:15,927 --> 01:12:17,303
Mom, what are you doing here?

1127
01:12:17,385 --> 01:12:19,178
I've come to see you.

1128
01:12:20,219 --> 01:12:23,011
Would you like to go to your room
and have some privacy?

1129
01:12:23,094 --> 01:12:26,053
No, we'll go out to the street.

1130
01:12:26,136 --> 01:12:27,178
Yes.

1131
01:12:30,053 --> 01:12:32,219
Thank you, for everything.

1132
01:12:32,303 --> 01:12:33,427
You're welcome.

1133
01:12:34,053 --> 01:12:35,469
Won't you feel cold?

1134
01:12:36,594 --> 01:12:38,844
No, I love this jacket.

1135
01:12:41,719 --> 01:12:45,219
You didn't have to leave home
to change your hairstyle.

1136
01:12:47,594 --> 01:12:48,927
Do you live here?

1137
01:12:49,011 --> 01:12:50,552
Yes, in Janis' house.

1138
01:12:50,635 --> 01:12:52,053
And what do you do there?

1139
01:12:52,136 --> 01:12:54,219
I look after the house and the child.

1140
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:56,178
You're working as a maid?

1141
01:12:56,552 --> 01:12:57,927
I can't believe it.

1142
01:12:58,011 --> 01:12:59,969
Did we give you an education for that?

1143
01:13:01,344 --> 01:13:03,219
Mom, I have to work.

1144
01:13:03,303 --> 01:13:06,219
Your father can find you
a decent job in Granada.

1145
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:08,344
Don't talk to me
about my father or Granada.

1146
01:13:10,427 --> 01:13:12,011
Hey, Ana! How are you?

1147
01:13:12,094 --> 01:13:13,011
Hello.

1148
01:13:13,094 --> 01:13:14,178
What'll you have?

1149
01:13:14,261 --> 01:13:15,927
A tea for me, please.

1150
01:13:16,011 --> 01:13:17,719
A strawberry ice cream.

1151
01:13:17,927 --> 01:13:19,635
Thanks.

1152
01:13:28,219 --> 01:13:31,719
After Anita died I heard you
arguing with dad on the phone.

1153
01:13:32,469 --> 01:13:35,385
It didn't suit either of you to have me.

1154
01:13:36,136 --> 01:13:38,427
I was too depressed to make a decision

1155
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:42,510
but as soon as I could get up
I left home and I'm not going back.

1156
01:13:42,594 --> 01:13:44,427
And much less to his house.

1157
01:13:45,636 --> 01:13:47,136
I'm an adult,

1158
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:49,094
so you live your lives
and I'll live mine.

1159
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:02,302
Now we put the fish
on top of the potatoes

1160
01:14:03,178 --> 01:14:07,969
and if it dries out
we add a little bit of wine.

1161
01:14:08,385 --> 01:14:09,552
OK.

1162
01:14:17,927 --> 01:14:18,969
It's my mother.

1163
01:14:20,011 --> 01:14:21,385
Apologizing.

1164
01:14:24,594 --> 01:14:26,178
Answer her.

1165
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:31,344
I don't know,
I don't want to be more cruel to her.

1166
01:14:31,427 --> 01:14:33,427
Well, say that.

1167
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:36,219
Mom, I don't want
to be more cruel to you.

1168
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:40,178
Go on, she'll love it.

1169
01:15:02,136 --> 01:15:03,802
Who's that hippy?

1170
01:15:04,469 --> 01:15:06,094
My mother.

1171
01:15:07,719 --> 01:15:10,886
-Are you the baby?
-Yes.

1172
01:15:11,178 --> 01:15:14,802
I was just a few weeks old there,
we were in Ibiza.

1173
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:19,011
You know she called me
after Janis Joplin?

1174
01:15:22,219 --> 01:15:24,178
Who's Janis Joplin?

1175
01:15:25,344 --> 01:15:27,053
That's her singing.

1176
01:15:30,636 --> 01:15:35,719
My mother also died at 27
from an overdose.

1177
01:15:37,385 --> 01:15:39,719
It was summertime
and the living wasn't easy.

1178
01:15:41,302 --> 01:15:44,844
I was five, but I was already living
in my town with my grandmother.

1179
01:15:47,219 --> 01:15:48,719
Is that your grandmother?

1180
01:15:48,928 --> 01:15:50,552
That's my great-grandmother.

1181
01:15:52,219 --> 01:15:54,260
This is my grandmother Cecilia.

1182
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:57,469
She took care of me and reared me.

1183
01:16:00,177 --> 01:16:03,802
One day you'll have to come
and see the house where we lived.

1184
01:16:06,636 --> 01:16:07,802
Whenever you want.

1185
01:16:10,219 --> 01:16:12,177
To your grandmother Cecilia,

1186
01:16:14,886 --> 01:16:16,636
to your mother,

1187
01:16:20,219 --> 01:16:22,177
to your daughter,

1188
01:16:27,094 --> 01:16:28,302
and to you.

1189
01:16:29,177 --> 01:16:30,385
And to you.

1190
01:17:49,386 --> 01:17:51,260
It's here.

1191
01:17:57,844 --> 01:18:00,844
FOREVER LOVED BY YOUR MOTHER ANA
AND YOUR GRANDMOTHER TERESA

1192
01:18:14,552 --> 01:18:17,511
Did you tell the father
that the baby died?

1193
01:18:17,594 --> 01:18:19,177
I don't know who he is.

1194
01:18:20,177 --> 01:18:22,594
Aren't you curious to know?

1195
01:18:23,427 --> 01:18:27,177
There were three of them, classmates.

1196
01:18:28,219 --> 01:18:32,219
We were really drunk and high
in the home of one of them,

1197
01:18:32,302 --> 01:18:34,052
the one I liked.

1198
01:18:34,135 --> 01:18:37,135
His parents were away
for the weekend.

1199
01:18:37,886 --> 01:18:39,552
I was really blasted.

1200
01:18:39,928 --> 01:18:44,010
I screwed with the one I liked
but the others had filmed us on a phone

1201
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:46,844
and they threatened
to post it on Internet

1202
01:18:46,928 --> 01:18:49,219
if I didn't do it with them too,

1203
01:18:49,302 --> 01:18:51,135
and I had to screw them.

1204
01:18:51,552 --> 01:18:52,886
But that's rape!

1205
01:18:53,594 --> 01:18:56,552
Two days later
they said the same thing,

1206
01:18:56,636 --> 01:18:59,469
either I screwed them again
or they'd post the video.

1207
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:02,761
So I went to my father
and told him.

1208
01:19:02,844 --> 01:19:05,719
-And he reported them?
-No.

1209
01:19:05,928 --> 01:19:07,844
He wanted to avoid a scandal,

1210
01:19:07,928 --> 01:19:09,386
and also for my sake.

1211
01:19:09,469 --> 01:19:10,594
Your sake?

1212
01:19:10,678 --> 01:19:14,594
Yes, so I wouldn't have to suffer
the pressure from the media and all.

1213
01:19:15,803 --> 01:19:19,469
When I found out I was pregnant,
he sent me to my mother.

1214
01:19:20,219 --> 01:19:21,928
You should have reported it.

1215
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:25,678
Those boys might keep on raping
if they're not stopped.

1216
01:19:25,886 --> 01:19:27,803
I didn't have the strength.

1217
01:19:28,177 --> 01:19:31,844
I was terrified about a trial,
the police, the press.

1218
01:19:32,552 --> 01:19:35,969
I didn't want to relive it over and over.

1219
01:19:41,552 --> 01:19:42,552
Look.

1220
01:19:44,928 --> 01:19:46,594
That's them?

1221
01:20:05,636 --> 01:20:07,969
Go to sleep.

1222
01:20:08,052 --> 01:20:09,219
Give her a kiss.

1223
01:20:11,177 --> 01:20:13,302
Go on, chubby cheeks.

1224
01:20:17,177 --> 01:20:18,219
Elena?

1225
01:20:18,302 --> 01:20:19,844
I doubt it, she'd have called.

1226
01:20:19,927 --> 01:20:21,135
I'll go and see.

1227
01:20:21,219 --> 01:20:22,552
I'll put her down.

1228
01:20:24,552 --> 01:20:27,094
No more joking around.

1229
01:20:28,927 --> 01:20:30,219
Who is it?

1230
01:20:30,302 --> 01:20:31,344
<i>It's Arturo.</i>

1231
01:20:31,719 --> 01:20:32,552
Hello.

1232
01:20:32,803 --> 01:20:36,969
I've called you several times
but something's wrong with your number.

1233
01:20:37,052 --> 01:20:38,844
<i>Yes, I changed it.</i>

1234
01:20:39,678 --> 01:20:42,010
I've got great news,

1235
01:20:42,094 --> 01:20:44,052
but I'd like to see your face
when I tell you.

1236
01:20:44,594 --> 01:20:46,344
Wait for me in the tavern.

1237
01:20:46,427 --> 01:20:47,594
I'll be right down.

1238
01:20:47,678 --> 01:20:48,553
<i>Great.</i>

1239
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:50,719
Who was it?

1240
01:20:51,302 --> 01:20:53,636
An old friend,
I'm going to meet him.

1241
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:58,052
I changed my number
and he couldn't find me,

1242
01:20:58,135 --> 01:20:59,511
so he came here.

1243
01:21:00,469 --> 01:21:02,553
Why didn't you ask him up?

1244
01:21:02,636 --> 01:21:05,427
I feel like some fresh air.

1245
01:21:08,927 --> 01:21:10,344
And dinner?

1246
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:12,261
Are you going to eat here?

1247
01:21:12,344 --> 01:21:14,094
I don't think so.

1248
01:21:17,135 --> 01:21:19,010
What would you like to have?

1249
01:21:19,803 --> 01:21:22,594
A cold white wine.

1250
01:21:22,678 --> 01:21:24,885
To celebrate what you have to tell me.

1251
01:21:25,094 --> 01:21:26,469
You promised it's good.

1252
01:21:26,553 --> 01:21:27,678
Yes.

1253
01:21:27,761 --> 01:21:30,511
The foundation has decided
to open your grave in July.

1254
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:32,553
You're going to open our grave?

1255
01:21:33,927 --> 01:21:35,719
But that's in three months.

1256
01:21:35,803 --> 01:21:39,302
The board will inform you officially
if you can give me a number.

1257
01:21:39,844 --> 01:21:41,511
I'll do that right now.

1258
01:21:41,594 --> 01:21:43,177
Have you got a pen?

1259
01:21:44,927 --> 01:21:46,344
In July?

1260
01:21:46,885 --> 01:21:48,386
I'll direct the excavation,

1261
01:21:48,469 --> 01:21:50,553
the foundation supplies
the technical means.

1262
01:21:51,052 --> 01:21:52,719
I don't know how to thank you.

1263
01:21:52,803 --> 01:21:54,636
There's nothing to thank,

1264
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:56,678
that's why I dared come directly
to your house.

1265
01:21:58,136 --> 01:22:00,261
This is my new number.

1266
01:22:01,636 --> 01:22:03,553
Were you avoiding me?

1267
01:22:03,636 --> 01:22:04,844
You? No, heavens!

1268
01:22:05,844 --> 01:22:08,010
It's a long story,

1269
01:22:08,094 --> 01:22:09,553
I'll tell you one day.

1270
01:22:09,636 --> 01:22:12,386
You look wonderful.
Is everything OK?

1271
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:15,719
I'm working a lot,
but it's all good.

1272
01:22:15,927 --> 01:22:16,761
And Cecilia?

1273
01:22:16,969 --> 01:22:18,469
She's great.

1274
01:22:18,553 --> 01:22:21,010
-And you, your family?
-Fine.

1275
01:22:21,094 --> 01:22:24,302
My wife has fully recovered,
according to the doctors.

1276
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:26,219
I'm delighted.

1277
01:22:26,302 --> 01:22:28,302
We're separating.

1278
01:22:29,761 --> 01:22:30,844
I told her about us.

1279
01:22:31,052 --> 01:22:33,010
Now? Why?

1280
01:22:33,094 --> 01:22:36,136
I didn't like the feeling
of hiding it from her.

1281
01:22:36,219 --> 01:22:39,511
I felt terrible having to lie to her.

1282
01:23:06,553 --> 01:23:08,302
Go back to sleep.

1283
01:23:14,678 --> 01:23:16,469
You smell of alcohol.

1284
01:23:16,553 --> 01:23:19,428
I drank a bit of wine.

1285
01:23:21,177 --> 01:23:24,136
Go back to sleep, go on.

1286
01:23:30,969 --> 01:23:32,927
I'm not awake.

1287
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:37,469
I'm dreaming.

1288
01:23:50,636 --> 01:23:55,010
It's delicious, the wine is delicious.

1289
01:23:57,052 --> 01:23:59,511
Go back to sleep, it's very late.

1290
01:24:08,594 --> 01:24:10,927
I'm tired.

1291
01:24:18,969 --> 01:24:21,802
Were you with your friend all this time?

1292
01:24:22,011 --> 01:24:23,802
Yes.

1293
01:24:26,136 --> 01:24:27,677
Did you screw him?

1294
01:24:28,636 --> 01:24:30,760
No, why would you say that?

1295
01:24:33,094 --> 01:24:35,344
You had lots of time.

1296
01:24:36,969 --> 01:24:41,011
We were talking and drinking.

1297
01:24:41,094 --> 01:24:43,177
I'd forgotten what that was like.

1298
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:01,177
Your friend from last night?

1299
01:25:01,511 --> 01:25:04,760
His name is Arturo
and he's the father of my child.

1300
01:25:04,969 --> 01:25:08,094
You told me you wouldn't see him again.

1301
01:25:08,177 --> 01:25:10,719
We had a lot to talk about.

1302
01:25:11,927 --> 01:25:13,428
Are you jealous?

1303
01:25:14,469 --> 01:25:17,303
I don't know.
What were you talking about?

1304
01:25:18,511 --> 01:25:20,760
I'll tell you another time, OK?

1305
01:25:21,303 --> 01:25:24,219
I'm meeting Elena for another cover,
I have to leave now.

1306
01:25:25,177 --> 01:25:26,052
And Elena?

1307
01:25:26,136 --> 01:25:27,219
What?

1308
01:25:28,219 --> 01:25:30,052
I think she likes you.

1309
01:25:30,594 --> 01:25:32,802
We've known each other forever...

1310
01:25:33,094 --> 01:25:35,677
But it's true,
I think she's always liked me.

1311
01:25:36,177 --> 01:25:39,303
In any case she respects me,
if that's what's worrying you.

1312
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:42,177
I have to go.

1313
01:25:43,303 --> 01:25:45,594
When you want to go out, tell me.

1314
01:25:45,677 --> 01:25:48,136
I don't want you here like a prisoner.

1315
01:25:48,219 --> 01:25:49,469
All right?

1316
01:25:49,553 --> 01:25:51,386
But I want to go out with you,

1317
01:25:51,635 --> 01:25:56,677
so you can show me new places
and we can get drunk together.

1318
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,719
We'll have to get drunk here,

1319
01:25:58,802 --> 01:26:01,219
because who'll look after Cecilia?

1320
01:26:01,303 --> 01:26:03,011
Don't make me late.

1321
01:26:04,219 --> 01:26:07,136
I'll have to go back
to drinking in the street.

1322
01:26:10,428 --> 01:26:12,760
So, what about your friend
from the other night?

1323
01:26:13,802 --> 01:26:16,344
-Arturo?
-Yes.

1324
01:26:17,511 --> 01:26:19,760
He's a forensic anthropologist

1325
01:26:20,344 --> 01:26:22,760
and he belongs to a scientific foundation.

1326
01:26:22,969 --> 01:26:25,844
They're going to open the grave
where my great-grandfather is.

1327
01:26:26,677 --> 01:26:29,802
That's what we were talking about,
and we were celebrating.

1328
01:26:30,011 --> 01:26:34,386
You're obsessed with the grave
and that man is taking advantage of it.

1329
01:26:35,511 --> 01:26:36,969
What?

1330
01:26:37,469 --> 01:26:39,552
You have to look to the future,

1331
01:26:39,635 --> 01:26:42,469
otherwise you'll just open old wounds.

1332
01:26:42,552 --> 01:26:44,594
Who said that? Your father?

1333
01:26:45,219 --> 01:26:46,303
Yes.

1334
01:26:46,844 --> 01:26:48,303
Do you think that?

1335
01:26:49,386 --> 01:26:51,719
I don't know.
I've never thought about those things.

1336
01:26:52,594 --> 01:26:55,094
It's time you knew
what country you're living in!

1337
01:26:57,303 --> 01:26:59,303
I don't like you talking to me like that.

1338
01:27:01,011 --> 01:27:04,428
No one in your family
has told you the truth about our country.

1339
01:27:05,261 --> 01:27:10,219
There are over 100,000 people missing,
buried in ditches or close to cemeteries.

1340
01:27:10,802 --> 01:27:13,344
Their grandchildren
and great-grandchildren

1341
01:27:13,428 --> 01:27:15,052
would like to disinter them

1342
01:27:15,136 --> 01:27:16,927
and give them a decent burial

1343
01:27:17,011 --> 01:27:19,635
because they promised that
to their mothers and grandmothers.

1344
01:27:19,719 --> 01:27:21,802
And until we do that,
the war won't have ended.

1345
01:27:23,469 --> 01:27:25,719
You're very young,
but it's time you knew

1346
01:27:25,927 --> 01:27:28,844
where your father and his family
were during the war.

1347
01:27:29,052 --> 01:27:30,178
You need to know,

1348
01:27:30,261 --> 01:27:32,552
so you can decide
where you want to be.

1349
01:27:36,219 --> 01:27:38,594
I just want to be where you are.

1350
01:27:38,969 --> 01:27:40,178
That isn't relevant now.

1351
01:27:40,261 --> 01:27:42,261
Don't you care
that I want to be with you?

1352
01:27:43,011 --> 01:27:44,136
Leave it.

1353
01:27:59,677 --> 01:28:00,677
Aren't you eating?

1354
01:28:02,052 --> 01:28:03,303
I'm not hungry.

1355
01:28:07,969 --> 01:28:09,303
You're tired of me, aren't you?

1356
01:28:11,094 --> 01:28:12,344
No.

1357
01:28:13,969 --> 01:28:15,677
Then what's wrong?

1358
01:28:17,052 --> 01:28:20,178
Did you sleep with Arturo
and you don't want to tell me?

1359
01:28:22,552 --> 01:28:23,802
No.

1360
01:28:26,303 --> 01:28:28,761
The problems are with myself.

1361
01:28:31,677 --> 01:28:34,552
During all these months

1362
01:28:36,552 --> 01:28:38,344
I've been keeping something from you.

1363
01:28:39,594 --> 01:28:41,969
That you don't love me
and you want me to go?

1364
01:28:42,552 --> 01:28:44,761
That you've decided
to go back to your child's father

1365
01:28:44,844 --> 01:28:46,011
and form a family with him?

1366
01:28:46,303 --> 01:28:47,510
No.

1367
01:28:48,303 --> 01:28:49,386
Then what is it?

1368
01:28:52,552 --> 01:28:53,761
Come.

1369
01:29:29,011 --> 01:29:31,344
Look carefully
at what I'm going to show you.

1370
01:29:31,427 --> 01:29:33,094
It's very important.

1371
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:52,844
Do you understand what it says?

1372
01:29:56,011 --> 01:30:02,053
It excludes Janis Martínez
as biological mother

1373
01:30:02,136 --> 01:30:05,927
of Cecilia Martínez.

1374
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:12,136
I'm not Cecilia's mother.

1375
01:30:13,427 --> 01:30:14,761
I don't understand.

1376
01:30:18,344 --> 01:30:19,969
Look at this other report.

1377
01:30:28,552 --> 01:30:30,469
"Biological..."

1378
01:30:30,552 --> 01:30:36,427
"Ana Manso is the biological mother
of Cecilia Martínez".

1379
01:30:38,677 --> 01:30:41,011
But I'm Ana Manso.

1380
01:30:44,219 --> 01:30:45,844
Cecilia is your daughter.

1381
01:30:46,136 --> 01:30:47,510
What?

1382
01:30:52,844 --> 01:30:54,927
I guess that...

1383
01:30:57,136 --> 01:30:59,178
they swapped them at birth.

1384
01:31:18,969 --> 01:31:21,094
"Ana Manso

1385
01:31:21,178 --> 01:31:24,011
is the biological mother

1386
01:31:24,094 --> 01:31:26,969
of Cecilia Martínez".

1387
01:31:29,677 --> 01:31:31,427
I don't understand.

1388
01:31:32,053 --> 01:31:34,844
I never did a maternity test.

1389
01:31:35,219 --> 01:31:38,178
I did it for you,
without telling you.

1390
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:41,094
Remember when you'd just got here,
with latex gloves?

1391
01:31:41,719 --> 01:31:44,260
Why didn't you tell me before?

1392
01:31:45,928 --> 01:31:47,094
That's Cecilia,

1393
01:31:48,385 --> 01:31:49,636
I'll check on her.

1394
01:32:06,219 --> 01:32:08,178
My little princess.

1395
01:32:09,802 --> 01:32:12,136
<i>My daughter.</i>

1396
01:33:03,344 --> 01:33:05,344
Are you my little girl?

1397
01:33:39,552 --> 01:33:41,177
Janis,

1398
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:42,969
I'm going crazy.

1399
01:33:43,969 --> 01:33:46,011
Are those reports true?

1400
01:33:47,385 --> 01:33:49,469
Why would I lie to you about this?

1401
01:33:49,552 --> 01:33:51,761
But where's your daughter?

1402
01:33:51,969 --> 01:33:53,344
What have you done with her?

1403
01:33:53,928 --> 01:33:54,928
They swapped them,

1404
01:33:55,011 --> 01:33:56,344
I told you.

1405
01:33:59,011 --> 01:34:01,803
You mean that my Anita was yours?

1406
01:34:03,636 --> 01:34:04,886
I'm sure of it.

1407
01:34:06,177 --> 01:34:09,844
They must have changed them
the day they were in observation.

1408
01:34:11,469 --> 01:34:13,260
Since when have you known?

1409
01:34:13,594 --> 01:34:16,594
When you came here I already knew
that I wasn't Cecilia's mother

1410
01:34:16,803 --> 01:34:18,594
and Arturo wasn't the father.

1411
01:34:18,677 --> 01:34:21,511
We both had doubts,
that's why I did the test.

1412
01:34:21,594 --> 01:34:24,011
So you already knew
when I told you Anita had died?

1413
01:34:24,511 --> 01:34:26,053
Yes.

1414
01:34:30,177 --> 01:34:33,677
I was going to tell you
about my suspicions, I swear.

1415
01:34:33,886 --> 01:34:36,552
I called you, as soon as I found out,

1416
01:34:37,511 --> 01:34:39,094
but I backed out.

1417
01:34:40,427 --> 01:34:42,928
When I invited you for dinner
the first time,

1418
01:34:43,011 --> 01:34:45,260
after meeting you at the café,

1419
01:34:45,344 --> 01:34:46,928
I was going to tell you.

1420
01:34:48,427 --> 01:34:51,011
But when you said that your daughter...

1421
01:34:51,511 --> 01:34:53,011
who would be mine...

1422
01:34:53,719 --> 01:34:55,636
had died...

1423
01:34:58,969 --> 01:35:00,135
I couldn't do it.

1424
01:35:04,177 --> 01:35:07,844
I was terrified of losing two children
at the same time.

1425
01:35:07,928 --> 01:35:09,844
You never thought about me?

1426
01:35:09,928 --> 01:35:11,344
All the time.

1427
01:35:12,052 --> 01:35:14,260
You never put yourself in my place.

1428
01:35:14,344 --> 01:35:17,969
Living together, sleeping together...

1429
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:23,552
You kept it quiet all these months
and didn't give a damn about me.

1430
01:35:26,177 --> 01:35:28,010
Is that why you changed your number?

1431
01:35:29,219 --> 01:35:30,969
So I couldn't find you?

1432
01:35:33,052 --> 01:35:34,552
I guess so.

1433
01:35:44,219 --> 01:35:46,928
Yes, mom.
I'll explain it all.

1434
01:35:47,969 --> 01:35:50,094
I'm bringing Cecilia with me.

1435
01:35:51,344 --> 01:35:54,260
Not the mother,
I'm going on my own with her.

1436
01:35:56,469 --> 01:35:59,260
No, I'm going to take a taxi.

1437
01:36:00,135 --> 01:36:02,552
I'll see you soon.

1438
01:36:03,302 --> 01:36:04,803
What are you going to do?

1439
01:36:06,052 --> 01:36:08,260
I'm going to my mother's house
with Cecilia.

1440
01:36:09,094 --> 01:36:10,969
She's very happy.

1441
01:36:11,678 --> 01:36:12,886
Did you tell her?

1442
01:36:13,594 --> 01:36:14,969
Not yet.

1443
01:36:17,302 --> 01:36:19,511
Stay, please.

1444
01:36:19,594 --> 01:36:23,886
Please, give me time
to get used to the idea.

1445
01:36:26,386 --> 01:36:29,094
It's best if we separate

1446
01:36:29,803 --> 01:36:32,302
so I can take all this in.

1447
01:36:37,844 --> 01:36:41,094
But can't we analyze
the situation here,

1448
01:36:41,177 --> 01:36:43,678
together, like two adults?

1449
01:36:45,927 --> 01:36:49,844
The hardest part was telling you

1450
01:36:51,552 --> 01:36:53,052
and I've done that.

1451
01:36:59,594 --> 01:37:01,594
I can't bear you taking her away.

1452
01:37:04,219 --> 01:37:06,177
You've complicated things too much.

1453
01:37:07,844 --> 01:37:09,678
We'll have time to talk later.

1454
01:37:15,219 --> 01:37:16,969
Up you come.

1455
01:37:38,553 --> 01:37:40,302
Can you take the bags?

1456
01:37:45,469 --> 01:37:47,469
Let's go.

1457
01:38:02,010 --> 01:38:05,302
My darling, I love you very much.

1458
01:38:08,427 --> 01:38:09,719
Goodbye, sweetheart.

1459
01:39:05,386 --> 01:39:06,553
<i>Yes?</i>

1460
01:39:06,636 --> 01:39:09,885
Arturo... It's Janis.

1461
01:39:09,969 --> 01:39:11,177
Are you in Madrid?

1462
01:39:11,261 --> 01:39:12,719
<i>Yes. Is something wrong?</i>

1463
01:39:12,927 --> 01:39:14,427
Can you come, please?

1464
01:39:14,678 --> 01:39:16,885
She has some of my mother's features.

1465
01:39:21,094 --> 01:39:25,760
It was horrific to find her
when she was already dead.

1466
01:39:56,010 --> 01:39:57,636
Hello.

1467
01:39:57,719 --> 01:39:58,678
Did I wake you?

1468
01:39:59,261 --> 01:40:00,969
Ana...

1469
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:04,802
I'm groggy from the tranquilizers.

1470
01:40:05,469 --> 01:40:08,927
I'm sorry that I left like that,
but it was...

1471
01:40:09,010 --> 01:40:12,760
It was a very difficult situation,
and I'm responsible.

1472
01:40:13,511 --> 01:40:15,927
It's fair that I'm punished.

1473
01:40:16,219 --> 01:40:18,261
I'm not punishing you.

1474
01:40:18,344 --> 01:40:20,428
You can come and see her
when you like.

1475
01:40:21,302 --> 01:40:22,969
Thank you.

1476
01:40:23,927 --> 01:40:26,136
I'm much calmer now.

1477
01:40:27,136 --> 01:40:29,511
<i>It isn't easy to understand all at once,</i>

1478
01:40:29,719 --> 01:40:31,511
<i>but I'm worried about you.</i>

1479
01:40:31,719 --> 01:40:34,636
We have to sort this out between us.

1480
01:40:34,927 --> 01:40:36,802
The worst was last night.

1481
01:40:37,594 --> 01:40:41,136
Now I have to detach myself
gradually from Cecilia.

1482
01:40:42,052 --> 01:40:44,677
I'd come and see you right now,

1483
01:40:45,885 --> 01:40:47,802
<i>but it's best if I wait a few days.</i>

1484
01:40:47,885 --> 01:40:50,428
You can't stop seeing her
just like that.

1485
01:40:50,511 --> 01:40:53,428
No, of course not.

1486
01:40:54,428 --> 01:40:56,760
I'll call you when I feel up to
seeing you.

1487
01:40:56,844 --> 01:40:59,469
We have to talk about us too.

1488
01:40:59,677 --> 01:41:01,302
I don't know where I stand with you.

1489
01:41:03,177 --> 01:41:04,052
Yes.

1490
01:41:04,927 --> 01:41:07,511
We'll talk about everything,
whenever you want.

1491
01:41:09,219 --> 01:41:10,885
Kisses.

1492
01:41:50,428 --> 01:41:52,136
Here.

1493
01:41:52,219 --> 01:41:54,177
They told us it was here.

1494
01:41:56,303 --> 01:41:58,760
First we'll visit the woman who's ill.

1495
01:41:58,844 --> 01:42:00,136
Aunt Brígida.

1496
01:42:00,635 --> 01:42:02,511
She may not even last to July.

1497
01:42:03,261 --> 01:42:05,344
The two granddaughters
will be there too.

1498
01:42:06,011 --> 01:42:06,844
Perfect.

1499
01:42:14,594 --> 01:42:16,469
Janis, this is wonderful!

1500
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:18,969
I'm so happy to see you!

1501
01:42:19,386 --> 01:42:20,927
You look beautiful!

1502
01:42:21,011 --> 01:42:22,094
And so do you.

1503
01:42:22,635 --> 01:42:23,802
This is Arturo.

1504
01:42:23,885 --> 01:42:25,386
He's heading the excavation.

1505
01:42:25,469 --> 01:42:27,052
Delighted.

1506
01:42:27,136 --> 01:42:28,511
-And your grandma?
-She's inside.

1507
01:42:28,594 --> 01:42:30,428
She dozed off waiting for you.

1508
01:42:30,635 --> 01:42:32,844
She was so anxious
she didn't sleep last night.

1509
01:42:32,927 --> 01:42:33,885
Go on in.

1510
01:42:33,969 --> 01:42:34,844
Thank you.

1511
01:42:38,303 --> 01:42:40,177
Grandma, they're here.

1512
01:42:40,261 --> 01:42:41,927
Aunt Brígida!

1513
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:44,011
Don't get up.

1514
01:42:44,094 --> 01:42:46,428
I thought you'd never get here.

1515
01:42:47,802 --> 01:42:48,927
Sit down.

1516
01:42:49,469 --> 01:42:53,802
This is Arturo, an expert.
He's in charge of the excavation.

1517
01:42:54,469 --> 01:42:56,219
We'll take samples of your saliva.

1518
01:42:56,303 --> 01:42:57,344
With a jab?

1519
01:42:57,428 --> 01:42:59,261
No, with a cotton swab.

1520
01:42:59,344 --> 01:43:03,969
If you have to jab me, jab away.
I'm like a pin cushion!

1521
01:43:04,177 --> 01:43:06,719
She isn't well. I told you already.

1522
01:43:06,802 --> 01:43:08,428
Open your mouth.

1523
01:43:09,303 --> 01:43:11,094
Very good.

1524
01:43:13,386 --> 01:43:15,677
That's it.

1525
01:43:16,094 --> 01:43:18,011
I'm very ill.

1526
01:43:18,969 --> 01:43:21,177
I hope for just one thing.

1527
01:43:21,261 --> 01:43:24,969
That they find my father
and I can bury him with my mother.

1528
01:43:25,052 --> 01:43:28,052
And she wants us
to bury her there too.

1529
01:43:28,136 --> 01:43:29,386
I won't last long.

1530
01:43:29,594 --> 01:43:30,844
Grandma, don't say that.

1531
01:43:31,594 --> 01:43:34,261
The cancer is consuming me,

1532
01:43:34,344 --> 01:43:37,386
but my dream is
to reunite the whole family.

1533
01:43:38,178 --> 01:43:43,261
In life we couldn't be together,
at least at the end we will be.

1534
01:43:43,344 --> 01:43:45,677
Tell me about your father.

1535
01:43:46,844 --> 01:43:49,510
I was four months old
when they killed him.

1536
01:43:49,594 --> 01:43:51,219
And she has memories of him.

1537
01:43:52,386 --> 01:43:54,719
I remember what my mother told me.

1538
01:43:54,802 --> 01:43:56,844
And what did your mother tell you?

1539
01:43:56,927 --> 01:43:58,469
Lots of things.

1540
01:43:58,677 --> 01:44:00,760
When they came for him,

1541
01:44:00,844 --> 01:44:03,428
my father had me in his arms.

1542
01:44:03,635 --> 01:44:05,802
He was playing with me.

1543
01:44:06,011 --> 01:44:07,760
My mother used to tell me,

1544
01:44:07,844 --> 01:44:11,178
and it's as if I remember it
from thinking about it so much,

1545
01:44:11,261 --> 01:44:15,011
that the last thing my father did
was play with me.

1546
01:44:17,344 --> 01:44:20,219
I had a rattle.

1547
01:44:20,303 --> 01:44:23,052
We never saw it again after that.

1548
01:44:23,677 --> 01:44:27,635
My mother looked for it all over the house
but she never found it.

1549
01:44:29,178 --> 01:44:31,052
I guess he took it.

1550
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:35,760
Hello, Herminia!

1551
01:44:35,844 --> 01:44:37,635
How are you?

1552
01:44:37,719 --> 01:44:38,886
Fine.

1553
01:44:40,886 --> 01:44:43,969
This is Arturo,
he'll direct the exhumation in July.

1554
01:44:44,052 --> 01:44:46,344
Thank you so much,
we can't believe it.

1555
01:44:46,428 --> 01:44:47,594
Janis will have told you.

1556
01:44:47,677 --> 01:44:48,510
Yes, she did.

1557
01:44:48,594 --> 01:44:49,635
Come in.

1558
01:44:49,719 --> 01:44:51,052
Thank you.

1559
01:44:51,136 --> 01:44:52,719
The patio is beautiful!

1560
01:44:52,802 --> 01:44:53,969
Sit down.

1561
01:44:55,219 --> 01:44:57,011
Those wafers!

1562
01:44:57,094 --> 01:44:59,303
I haven't seen them in ages!

1563
01:44:59,635 --> 01:45:01,386
They're for you.

1564
01:45:04,761 --> 01:45:07,136
Is there any detail you remember
about your grandfather?

1565
01:45:07,219 --> 01:45:10,052
A lot, but we didn't know him.

1566
01:45:10,136 --> 01:45:14,219
Grandmother told us about him,
when she decided to talk.

1567
01:45:14,303 --> 01:45:18,178
Until just before she died
she never opened her mouth.

1568
01:45:18,261 --> 01:45:19,844
She was afraid.

1569
01:45:19,927 --> 01:45:21,594
We were all so afraid.

1570
01:45:23,219 --> 01:45:27,761
Grandfather was tall and handsome,
with beautiful eyes.

1571
01:45:27,844 --> 01:45:29,386
Just one.

1572
01:45:29,469 --> 01:45:31,178
The other was made of glass.

1573
01:45:31,261 --> 01:45:33,094
You don't see it in the photos.

1574
01:45:35,635 --> 01:45:37,344
My great-grandfather took that photo.

1575
01:45:38,178 --> 01:45:42,219
Did your grandmother say
if he carried anything regularly?

1576
01:45:42,303 --> 01:45:45,344
A watch, a pen,
a pipe, a piece of jewelry?

1577
01:45:46,136 --> 01:45:49,053
My mother told me that he never
took off his wedding ring,

1578
01:45:49,136 --> 01:45:50,385
not even in the fields.

1579
01:45:50,469 --> 01:45:52,761
-His wedding ring.
-Yes, never.

1580
01:45:52,844 --> 01:45:56,136
And inscribed on the inside
was the date of their wedding

1581
01:45:56,219 --> 01:45:59,011
and my grandmother's name, Josefa.

1582
01:45:59,635 --> 01:46:02,219
He was wearing clogs
when they took him.

1583
01:46:02,303 --> 01:46:04,844
They didn't give him time
to change his shoes.

1584
01:46:45,344 --> 01:46:47,594
My grandmother inherited
this house from her mother

1585
01:46:47,677 --> 01:46:49,385
and I inherited it from her.

1586
01:46:51,802 --> 01:46:53,927
I spent my childhood here.

1587
01:46:55,886 --> 01:46:58,302
My grandmother
was born in this room,

1588
01:46:59,136 --> 01:47:00,761
and my mother.

1589
01:49:03,969 --> 01:49:05,136
There's something here.

1590
01:49:10,302 --> 01:49:11,469
It's a casing.

1591
01:49:25,594 --> 01:49:26,886
-How was the drive?
-Great.

1592
01:49:29,344 --> 01:49:30,802
Look who's here!

1593
01:49:31,427 --> 01:49:33,011
Hello, Elena.

1594
01:49:33,761 --> 01:49:36,802
Hello, Cecilia. How are you?

1595
01:49:37,594 --> 01:49:38,469
How are you?

1596
01:49:38,677 --> 01:49:39,677
How about a kiss?

1597
01:49:39,761 --> 01:49:41,136
She's a bit cranky.

1598
01:49:41,219 --> 01:49:42,719
She doesn't like the car.

1599
01:49:43,511 --> 01:49:44,677
How are you getting on?

1600
01:49:44,761 --> 01:49:45,677
Fine.

1601
01:49:57,469 --> 01:50:00,135
So many years
waiting for this moment.

1602
01:50:01,677 --> 01:50:04,260
You don't know
how important it is for us.

1603
01:50:04,469 --> 01:50:07,135
I can imagine,
for us too.

1604
01:50:09,719 --> 01:50:11,094
Do you need anything?

1605
01:50:11,177 --> 01:50:13,135
No, we'll eat in the town.

1606
01:50:13,219 --> 01:50:14,886
Well, coffee and water, if you can.

1607
01:50:14,969 --> 01:50:16,761
I'll bring that now.

1608
01:50:16,844 --> 01:50:19,677
You can go and get settled in,
this'll take a while.

1609
01:50:19,761 --> 01:50:20,844
About how long?

1610
01:50:20,928 --> 01:50:25,053
It depends on the depth,
but three or four days.

1611
01:50:25,135 --> 01:50:26,594
But come whenever you want,

1612
01:50:26,677 --> 01:50:27,844
and the townspeople too.

1613
01:50:27,928 --> 01:50:29,636
Yes, they all want to come.

1614
01:50:29,719 --> 01:50:31,469
Let's go home.

1615
01:50:31,552 --> 01:50:33,053
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

1616
01:50:33,135 --> 01:50:34,761
See you later.

1617
01:50:36,594 --> 01:50:38,177
I'll bring the drinks now.

1618
01:50:58,260 --> 01:51:01,302
I'll drop by my house
and then bring them water and coffee.

1619
01:51:01,511 --> 01:51:03,219
We could go in the afternoon.

1620
01:51:03,427 --> 01:51:05,260
Let me know when you want to go.

1621
01:51:05,469 --> 01:51:06,719
Are you all right?

1622
01:51:06,803 --> 01:51:08,886
I really want to cry.

1623
01:51:09,761 --> 01:51:11,094
Let me know later.

1624
01:51:27,719 --> 01:51:28,928
It's so rural!

1625
01:51:29,011 --> 01:51:30,177
Yes, very rural.

1626
01:51:30,886 --> 01:51:33,260
I didn't want to modernize it.

1627
01:51:33,636 --> 01:51:35,094
No, I love it.

1628
01:51:35,177 --> 01:51:37,052
Do you like it, Cecilia?

1629
01:51:37,135 --> 01:51:38,719
Do you?

1630
01:51:38,803 --> 01:51:40,844
I'll show you around later.

1631
01:51:40,928 --> 01:51:42,886
All right.

1632
01:51:43,636 --> 01:51:46,052
You're going to have
a little brother or sister, Cecilia.

1633
01:51:48,011 --> 01:51:50,219
Do you know which it is?

1634
01:51:50,302 --> 01:51:53,844
No, it's too soon,
I'm only three months.

1635
01:51:53,928 --> 01:51:55,302
Have you thought of any name?

1636
01:51:55,511 --> 01:51:57,678
If it's a girl, Ana.

1637
01:51:58,803 --> 01:51:59,803
I like it.

1638
01:52:01,135 --> 01:52:04,135
If it's a boy, Antonio,
like my great-grandfather.

1639
01:52:04,678 --> 01:52:06,552
Do you like it?

1640
01:52:10,886 --> 01:52:14,052
My great-grandfather
was having dinner right here

1641
01:52:14,135 --> 01:52:18,427
with my great-grandmother
and my grandmother,

1642
01:52:19,010 --> 01:52:22,260
when the fascists came in
and took him.

1643
01:52:22,469 --> 01:52:24,260
They didn't even let him finish eating.

1644
01:52:25,302 --> 01:52:30,594
When he came back at dawn
he was pale and covered in mud.

1645
01:52:33,052 --> 01:52:36,803
He'd spent the whole night
digging his own grave.

1646
01:52:37,636 --> 01:52:41,094
The next night
they came for him again

1647
01:52:41,469 --> 01:52:43,094
but that time he didn't come back.

1648
01:52:43,636 --> 01:52:47,052
Why didn't he run off
after the first night?

1649
01:52:47,135 --> 01:52:51,260
I guess he didn't want to be separated
from his wife and daughter.

1650
01:52:54,302 --> 01:52:57,177
And out of pride and dignity.

1651
01:52:57,552 --> 01:52:58,761
I don't know.

1652
01:53:20,511 --> 01:53:23,219
If the femur goes in that direction,

1653
01:53:23,302 --> 01:53:25,344
the pelvis should be there.

1654
01:53:25,552 --> 01:53:29,636
Be careful with the pick,
the skull should be in that area.

1655
01:53:29,719 --> 01:53:31,886
So we'll continue?

1656
01:53:45,302 --> 01:53:46,636
A phalanx.

1657
01:53:56,553 --> 01:53:57,678
And a button.

1658
01:54:03,302 --> 01:54:05,427
They tied their hands with barbed wire.

1659
01:54:13,094 --> 01:54:14,469
The rattle.

1660
01:54:18,135 --> 01:54:20,469
I'm going to put a marker here.

1661
01:54:21,719 --> 01:54:23,261
Then we'll take a photo of that.

1662
01:55:28,469 --> 01:55:30,636
Good afternoon.

1663
01:55:30,719 --> 01:55:33,761
This is your moment,
we'll withdraw.

1664
01:56:55,344 --> 01:56:56,511
NO HISTORY IS MUTE.

1665
01:56:56,594 --> 01:56:58,594
NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY BURN IT,

1666
01:56:58,678 --> 01:57:00,760
NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY BREAK IT,

1667
01:57:00,844 --> 01:57:03,136
NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY LIE ABOUT IT,

1668
01:57:03,219 --> 01:57:05,511
HUMAN HISTORY REFUSES
TO SHUT ITS MOUTH.

1669
01:57:05,594 --> 01:57:06,760
