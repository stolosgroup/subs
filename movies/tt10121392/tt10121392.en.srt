00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,916
But I guess you could say
we're estranged now,

311
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,875
but not in a way
that's, like, restraining order.

312
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:21,125
- So, do I just go up and surprise her?
- No, you definitely don't do that.

313
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:24,083
Okay, but I'd like to go up and… take her…

314
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,083
Not by force,

315
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,458
to her high school reunion.

316
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:31,875
So, just, you know, Lydia Berman.

317
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,333
She'll be like, "Cool."

318
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,833
Lydia Berman.

319
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,041
Hello. There's a Lydia Berman here
to see Miss Stanton.

320
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,375
Says she's here
to take her to her high school reunion.

321
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,583
I'm here to take her...

322
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,291
- I said that.
- She doesn't go to parties on her own.

323
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,333
Wow, really?

324
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,083
That is surprising to hear.
I will send her up.

325
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,541
Well, she will see you.

326
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,125
I'm kinda relieved that's the answer.

327
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,708
Not how I thought that one was gonna go.

328
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:01,791
[elevator dings]

329
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,416
Oh.

330
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,125
- Thanks, man. Hi.
- [woman] Hello.

331
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,291
Miss Berman. Hi, I'm Jessie.

332
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,500
[Lydia] Oh.

333
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,416
Hi. You can just call me Lydia.

334
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
It's my name.

335
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,500
Whoa, this place is taters.

336
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,125
Look at this thing.

337
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,041
Whoa!

338
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:31,708
Goes all the way... I mean, how do you
change a bulb in something like that?

339
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,291
Uh, that would be a maintenance question.

340
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,583
Maintenance. There you go. Wow.

341
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:40,208
Well, Miss Stanton
is working at the moment,

342
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:43,708
but she should be available momentarily.
Is there anything I can get?

343
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,916
Can I get, like, an ice-cold brewski?

344
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,958
It's just gonna take the edge off,

345
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,791
'cause I'm kinda, like, clammy…

346
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,208
- Clamming out, if you get me, so…
- Okay.

347
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,750
Ah, thank you, Jessie.

348
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,208
[Emily] Hey, Lydi. Good to see you.

349
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,250
Hi.

350
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,833
Wow.

351
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,291
Long time, huh?

352
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,041
Yeah, it sure has been.

353
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,583
- You look good.
- Oh.

354
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,791
Thanks. Yeah, you look,
I mean, super classy.

355
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,041
Thanks.

356
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,375
So, uh…

357
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:29,750
What brings you by?

358
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:35,041
Well, I... You know, we were texting,
and… I mean, I texted you,

359
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:38,083
and then you…
you wrote back about the reunion,

360
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,333
which was, is, tonight.

361
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,708
And I was there,
and you hadn't gotten there yet, so I…

362
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:47,708
I remembered that you never liked to go
to parties solo, so I just thought I'd…

363
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,583
Thought I'd swing by and see
if you wanted me to go with you.

364
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:53,916
Was that tonight?

365
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,875
Oh, I'm sorry, Lydia.

366
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,083
I… I can't go to the reunion.

367
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,708
I… I got caught up with work.

368
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,250
Oh, well, yeah, I bet.
I mean, look at all this stuff.

369
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,583
It's like, "Beam me up, Scotty."
Beep, beep, bop.

370
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,500
You know, I don't know
what any of it does, but... [gasps]

371
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,791
Oh god. I'm so sorry.

372
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,500
Oh my god,
this sweater's probably so expensive.

373
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,458
It's okay. I'll just change.

374
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:23,166
- I don't wanna ruin your shirt.
- No, this shirt's, like, garbage.

375
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,000
Literally, I found it in the garbage,
so I don't…

376
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,750
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh.

377
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,583
I'll, uh, pay for dry cleaning...

378
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,666
No, no, no. I couldn't take your money.

379
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,125
But could you do me a favor and, um…

380
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:41,000
Ooh, don't touch anything,
uh, while I'm gone, please.

381
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,750
- Yeah, what a...
- Not… not even… not even that.

382
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,375
- Okay.
- Okay?

383
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,000
I speaken ze English.

384
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,000
[Emily chuckles] Jessie!

385
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,583
[door opens]

386
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,000
I need you to keep an eye on things.

387
00:20:55,333 --> 00:21:01,250
Oh, uh, she said that you're supposed to
get me another cold beer right away.

388
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,500
Seemed kind of, like, mad. I think at you.

389
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,125
Good luck.

390
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,708
Alright, I'm… I'm on it. Anything else?

391
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,958
- No, you're so sweet.
- Okay.

392
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,250
[sighs]

393
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,458
[muttering quietly] Stupid.

394
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:24,666
- [thud]
- Oh.

395
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:27,916
Cool.

396
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,916
Whoa. What is all this?

397
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:43,041
Alright, remember, Lydia,
you said you would not touch anything, so…

398
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,500
You should not.

399
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:51,958
What do you do?

400
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,083
Oh! [laughs]

401
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,541
Whoo! [hums]

402
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,208
Ooh, it's like old-school Atari.

403
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:03,583
- Let's see what she's got. Oh.
- [device powering up]

404
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,458
It's a light switch. Pft. Big deal.

405
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:13,166
Alright, I'm gonna sit,
not touch anything else,

406
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,541
and wait for my beer. [grunts]

407
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,833
[device beeps]

408
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,125
[Lydia straining]

409
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,000
No! Ow! Ow!

410
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,250
Whoa! This is
the world's stupidest massage chair!

411
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,208
It's not a massage chair, you idiot.

412
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:34,000
There has been
a breach in the injection room.

413
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,583
[moaning]

414
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:40,208
- Get me out of here!
- Dear god, Lydia. What have you done?

415
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,666
Emily, I didn't touch anything!

416
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,833
[spluttering] Okay, I touched a couple...
I touched one thing. I'm so sorry…

417
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,291
[snoring]

418
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:54,458
[Emily, echoing]
Twenty years of research down the drain.

419
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,625
How could you leave her alone in the lab?

420
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,833
[Jessie] She said you wanted me to get her
another beer. I'm sorry, Miss Stanton.

421
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:03,708
Lydia, do you have any idea
what you've done?

422
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:07,833
I've worked for this my entire life
and you've ruined everything.

423
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:11,041
Oh, I don't know
what was in those needles,

424
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,458
but I'm totally happy
to give it back to you.

425
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,875
I can, like, pee in a cup or something...

426
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,250
You don't understand.

427
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:21,916
Tonight, I was going to begin treatments
I've been working on my whole life.

428
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:25,500
I developed a genetic sequencing platform

429
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:29,875
that can alter a human's biochemistry
in unimaginable ways.

430
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:33,083
I finally finished
the work my parents started.

431
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:36,958
I was going to find
a way to stop the Miscreants.

432
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:41,083
I was going to become a super… person.

433
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:42,708
Whoa.

434
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,166
That is awesome, Em.

435
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:47,500
I always knew you could do it.

436
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:48,708
What's your power?

437
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:51,416
They were supposed to be
super strength and invisibility,

438
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,666
but you took
her treatment for strength.

439
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,958
I'm really, really sorry.

440
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,583
I didn't… I didn't mean to…

441
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:00,875
Maybe you can just,
like, cook up another batch.

442
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:03,500
It took five years to create that formula,

443
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:04,666
and more importantly,

444
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:08,125
your body's undergoing
a molecular change from the injections.

445
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:11,958
Your cardiovascular system
has been increased by 1,000%.

446
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:16,250
It's how those intense boils on your face
have already healed themselves.

447
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,000
Lydia, the process has started.

448
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:24,583
Well, that's not… very soothing to hear.

449
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:27,833
I mean, I feel weird and sweaty, and…

450
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:32,666
My heart's poundin' like a jackhammer
inside my chest because of this serum.

451
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,875
- What does that mean?
- If you stop taking the treatments,

452
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:39,041
your veins will shred
like a log in a wood chipper.

453
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,833
Jessie, could you report to security?

454
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:43,083
Of course.

455
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:46,208
Emily, the only logical thing
to do is stay the course.

456
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:50,708
We'll continue with the super strength
treatments with the village idiot here

457
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:53,291
and you begin the treatments
for invisibility.

458
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:54,666
"Village idiot?"

459
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:59,583
Hello, Chicago is a city, not a village,
and the best city in the world.

460
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,916
- The Bears, the Cubs...
- Not the time, Lydia.

461
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:05,791
- There is no other way, is there?
- No, Emily. You know that.

462
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:10,583
- Em, let's show you to your room.
- Wait a minute, I'm not staying here.

463
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:14,541
I've got stuff to do. I got work
on Monday. I've got good Bulls tickets.

464
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:16,208
If you stop the treatments,

465
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:20,333
it's entirely possible that your body
will violently explode over the weekend.

466
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:24,250
I can take a peek at a room, you know.

467
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:27,708
[sighs]

468
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:33,750
[Lydia] Whoa.

469
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:37,500
This looks like the jail cell
on <i>Battlestar Galactica.</i>

470
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:40,375
- Alright, come on, come on, come on.
- Alright.

471
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:41,291
[door closes]

472
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:45,916
The room is furnished in a non-distracting
manner to help with your recovery.

473
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,541
Somebody tell me who Urkel is.

474
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,083
- What's an Urkel?
- Not "what's," "who's" an Urkel.

475
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:53,916
It's Urkel's… Urkel.
Tell her who Urkel is.

476
00:25:54,791 --> 00:25:56,166
How do you not... Oh my god.

477
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:00,916
You got glasses and suspenders,
you know, and you seem super smart.

478
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,416
- Let me search.
- You know who Urkel is.

479
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,000
- How do you spell that?
- You spell it Ur-kel.

480
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:07,166
- Ur…
- Are you kidding?

481
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,791
[imitating Urkel] "Did I do that?"

482
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:12,333
Right? Does that ring a... "Did I do that?"

483
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:15,291
"Did I do that?" You know that.

484
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:18,041
"Did I… did I do that?"

485
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:20,750
Mom, is she having
a reaction to the injection?

486
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:22,708
No, she's always like this.

487
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:24,625
Did you say "Mom"?

488
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:27,583
"Mom"? You have a ki... You…

489
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:30,458
You have a kid and I didn't even know it?

490
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:33,208
- You have a secret kid for 20 years?
- I'm only 15.

491
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:36,333
Well, I don't know that
'cause she never told me!

492
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,833
We don't have time for any of this.

493
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:41,208
What is Jodie Foster's problem?

494
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:43,291
Allie helped me set up this whole lab.

495
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:45,625
She's former CIA. She runs things for me.

496
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:48,333
Wh... What? It's a compliment.

497
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:51,666
I'm saying Jodie Foster, like,
"It puts the lotion in the basket,"

498
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,666
not "Tay in the wind" Jodie Foster.

499
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,791
- Tay in the what?
- Tay in the wind. Ta...

500
00:26:55,875 --> 00:27:00,000
"Tay in the wind! Tay in the wind!" <i>Nell?</i>

501
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:02,625
- Who's Nell?
- "Who's Nell?" Who's Nell?

502
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:05,083
Jodie Foster, 1994.

503
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:09,958
Jodie Foster knows it's Jodie Foster!
How do you not know "Tay in the wind"?

504
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:16,958
We have clean women's clothing for you.
Everything you could possibly need,

505
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:21,166
and we will burn what you are wearing
at the first opportunity.

506
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,166
- Nobody's touchin' this.
- Yes, we are.

507
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:27,291
This is an authentic 1994
Slayer concert T-shirt,

508
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:29,500
bought in stadium,

509
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:32,416
and if anybody touches any of this,

510
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,291
I'm sorry, I know you're young,
I'll murder all of you.

511
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:39,250
Okay. Well, before we get there,
this device is for you.

512
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:41,000
If you need anything,

513
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,791
- someone will be on call.
- Why aren't you in school?

514
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,958
First, it's the middle of the night,

515
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:49,375
and second of all,
I graduated from Stanford last year.

516
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:52,083
Wow, she's a chip off the old nerd block.

517
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:54,416
She's not a nerd. She's smart.

518
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:56,083
[both] There's a difference.

519
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:58,833
And she helps us out a lot around here.

520
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:00,416
She's great with tech.

521
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,625
- Can I see your wrist for a second?
- Okay.

522
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:06,833
This is so we can monitor
your vitals as you recover and train.

523
00:28:06,916 --> 00:28:08,750
- Heart rate, blood pressure…
- [beep]

524
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:11,375
I've had something similar,
but on my ankle...

525
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:14,125
Lydia, she's 15.
Let's monitor our stories.

526
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,041
Got it.

527
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:16,625
- You play <i>Fortnite?</i>
- Yes...

528
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:18,208
- No.
- [Lydia] What's your handle?

529
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:19,833
T-Wagon-14.

530
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:23,208
Mine's L-Train-631-Harper-Avenue-
Apartment-7B.

531
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:25,166
Wait, is that your address?

532
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,541
Oh my god, don't put your address online.

533
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:30,083
I'm not putting my address online.

534
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:34,541
I'm at 7A.
7B is my asshole neighbor, Steve.

535
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:37,083
If somebody's gonna get whacked, it's him.

536
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:41,333
We should play.
But I gotta warn you. I play dirty!

537
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:42,416
[laughing]

538
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,833
I am unbelievably bored.

539
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:48,208
See you in the morning.
We start at 5:00 a.m.

540
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:50,333
5:00 a.m.? Bullshit.

541
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:52,791
Uh, I don't start at 5:00 a.m.

542
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,500
[device beeps]
<i>It's 5:00 a.m. Time to get up.</i>

543
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:58,583
[dramatic music plays]

544
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:03,083
[Emily] Okay, let's get started.

545
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:05,000
After a series of treatments,

546
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:08,500
I'm estimating that we can increase
your ATP by 10,000%.

547
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:12,083
Everything about you
will become stronger, including your skin,

548
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:15,916
your vascular and skeletal systems,
making it more difficult to hurt you.

549
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:21,416
And I'm estimating
that you'll be able to lift 20,000 pounds.

550
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,166
Roughly the weight of a city bus.

551
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,291
Oh my god, I'm gonna
throw the shit out of a city bus.

552
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:27,375
Language.

553
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:30,625
I'm gonna throw the pee crap
out of a city bus.

554
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:33,541
That isn't better
and you're not gonna be throwing a bus.

555
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:37,041
- That would be very bad.
- [Lydia silently mouthing]

556
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,125
[Emily] Okay.

557
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:41,333
First, I need you
to lift this mallet and hit the block.

558
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:44,500
We'll monitor your vitals
and results to get our baseline.

559
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:48,083
- Why does it look like a carnival thing?
- Because I'm fun.

560
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,000
Okay.

561
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:49,916
Yeah.

562
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:55,083
Here goes nothin'.

563
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:58,500
[Lydia grunts]

564
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:02,083
I think I sprained my groin.
Do chicks have groins?

565
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:03,833
- Yes.
- [Lydia] That's what I did.

566
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:05,291
[groaning]

567
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:09,583
I might have just peed
just a little bit in my suit too.

568
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:12,166
According to this,
your bladder did release urine.

569
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,875
[exhales] Great first day, everybody.
I'll catch you tomorrow.

570
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:18,625
I... No, no, no.
We are just getting started.

571
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:21,833
Now that we have a baseline,
it's time to start your treatment.

572
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:23,916
It's not gonna like yesterday, is it?

573
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,708
[Emily] Not at all.

574
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:28,083
Each treatment is completely unique.

575
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:29,291
And it's safe, right?

576
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:31,458
Oh my god, are they safe?

577
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:33,333
It's a miracle you're still alive.

578
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:36,916
There can be
possible complications with any treatment.

579
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,750
Giving you super strength
has inevitable risks.

580
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:41,958
- Like what?
- Oh…

581
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:47,708
Like death, amnesia,
paralysis, stroke, brain death,

582
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:50,750
living inside your mind,
unable to speak or convey thoughts,

583
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:54,458
which would be the most unspeakable pain,
which we simply abbreviate as...

584
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:56,166
[all] "The unspeakable."

585
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,875
- And did I say death?
- Yes.

586
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:01,791
You know, I'm scrambling
to find the silver lining here.

587
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:04,625
What is it?
At least I don't have diarrhea.

588
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:06,458
Severe diarrhea is a given.

589
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:09,875
- That one right there is 100% a certainty.
- Oh my god.

590
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:13,500
Look, I'll do everything
in my power to keep you safe.

591
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:17,833
I'm doing this for my parents,
for this city.

592
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:20,833
[emotional music swells]

593
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:26,458
Let's get swole
and kick some Miscreant butt.

594
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:28,125
[groaning in pain]

595
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:30,416
Son of a…

596
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:36,833
You said it wasn't gonna be
anything like it was yesterday.

597
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:39,166
I meant metabolically speaking.

598
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,833
Actually, the delivery method
is exactly the same.

599
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:44,791
[wailing]

600
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:47,333
I'm burning! My face is on fire!

601
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:49,416
That should be over in two seconds.

602
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,958
[continues wailing]

603
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:53,083
Oh, yeah.

604
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:56,833
Oh, that was...
I mean, you said it, but it's actually…

605
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:58,583
It's even cool to the touch.

606
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:02,458
How about you go pick up that mallet
and hit that thing again?

607
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:07,958
I don't wanna, because I just got
a bazillion needles injected in my face.

608
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:11,333
Give it a try, Lydia.
Your results should be instantaneous.

609
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:16,875
Fine, alright. Hold on to your ta-tas,
'cause this thing's getting crushed.

610
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:18,291
What are ta-tas?

611
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:19,625
- Never mind.
- Okay.

612
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:22,791
- [grunts]
- [thud]

613
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,291
Well, that's a stone-cold bummer.

614
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:29,000
That's really good
for only your second treatment.

615
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,666
What do you mean?
How many treatments are there?

616
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,500
- Thirty-three.

Why my boobs?

For this course of treatment,

624
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,041
it's important to inject
through the breast tissue

625
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:05,666
into the pectoral muscle.

626
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:10,375
- When are we gonna start your treatments?
- Right now, actually.

627

Here you go, Miss Stanton.

628
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:16,125
- Thank you, Jessie.
- Wait, it's a pill?

629
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:19,833
Your whole treatment is…
one stinking pill?

630
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:22,833
It's a very large pill,
and I had to go off dairy for this.

Alright, hold on to your ta-tas, Bill.

634

Totally meant to do that.

[Lydia turns off TV] Ugh.

I hear you're not eating.

645
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:11,458
Nothing tastes right.
I'm not… I'm not hungry.

646
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:13,666
That's expected.
But you still need to eat.

647
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,958
Due to your body's changing chemistry,

648
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:18,750
this may be
the only thing you can stomach.

Ew!

Why raw chicken? That's so gross.

651
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:25,541
Your body needs pure uncooked amino acids

652
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:28,875
and your skeleton
needs phosphorus for density.

653
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:39,625
You can really taste the phosphorus.

It's really good.

[Emily] Alright.
This shot put is around 170 pounds.

00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:05,125
The average weight of an adult male.

Do you own that part of the building too?

The sign with my name on it? Yeah.

673
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:28,916
Could have been Bill Stanton's building.
It's a common name.

679
00:35:40,666 --> 00:35:44,458
If you're never in school,
then how do you meet dudes, or chicks,

or, you know,

Well, I was dating

involved in the deep dive

They come down, lay down some lyrics.

1080
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,583
I'll play guitar.
Right after I learn how to play guitar.

1081
00:56:07,666 --> 00:56:10,666
Uh, do you remember
the high school talent show?

1082
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:11,833
Girl, why...

1083
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:15,750
Get behind me.

1084
00:56:15,833 --> 00:56:17,833
[intense music plays]

1085
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:23,000
There's a handle, you know.

1086
00:56:23,083 --> 00:56:25,458
Oops, couldn't find it.

1087
00:56:27,666 --> 00:56:28,666
Stand down.

1088
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:33,625
This is a social visit. Otherwise,
you'd already be, you know, dead.

1089
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:37,208
You two are working together? Of course.

1090
00:56:38,041 --> 00:56:39,541
It's all been a setup.

1091
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:41,875
I bet The Crab works for you too, huh.

1092
00:56:41,958 --> 00:56:43,916
Are you rounding up all the Miscreants?

1093
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,750
Look at that. You really are smart.

1094
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:50,125
Sweet. Yeah, I'm kind of unionizing them.

1095
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:52,291
Someday, all Miscreants will work for me.

1096
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:55,458
Tracy, will you let Allie know
we have guests?

1097
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:56,375
Okay.

1098
00:56:56,958 --> 00:56:59,791
Was Allie the, uh, the bossy girl
with all the rules?

1099
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:02,375
Hey, she's unconscious in the hallway.

1100
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,250
Knocked her out
when we fried security.

1101
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:09,625
Anyway, you're changing the narrative
of the election, and I can't have that,

1102
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:13,666
so I could always use
a couple of Miscreants or superheroes

1103
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:15,458
or whatever it is you two are.

1104
00:57:15,541 --> 00:57:18,791
I could definitely use your muscle
as I expand operations here.

1105
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:23,375
And I could probably use
whatever it is that you do, too.

1106
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:25,791
- I think.
- What if we just say no?

1107
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:30,833
What if I pick you two up
and smack ya together like castanets, huh?

1108
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:33,708
Maybe we start
telling people what's going on.

1109
00:57:35,041 --> 00:57:37,708
I'm gonna win this election
and become mayor,

1110
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:41,583
and then I'm gonna win
other elections until I'm president,

1111
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:44,166
- and then I'll be pulling all the strings.
- Huh.

1112
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:47,875
You've got family here in town,
don't you, Bongo?

1113
00:57:47,958 --> 00:57:48,958
It's Bingo.

1114
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:50,166
I don't care.

1115
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:53,666
- I don't know why I'm defending that name.
- Not now.

1116
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:54,791
Come on, lady-girls.

1117
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:56,791
What side of history you wanna be on?

1118
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:03,458
I'm not scared of you.

1119
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:07,708
- Can't wait to kill you both.
- Oh...

1120
00:58:08,333 --> 00:58:09,916
- What?
- I wasn't done.

1121
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:13,458
- I'm right here.
- Sure, okay.

1122
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:15,208
Can't wait to kill you both.

1123
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:18,583
- All that for the same line...
- Can't wait to kill you both.

1124
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:21,916
Especially you, Bingo.

1125
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:27,208
You just... You gotta work on
your act a little bit. There we go.

1126
00:58:27,791 --> 00:58:29,125
She always walk that slow?

1127
00:58:30,125 --> 00:58:31,875
That's gotta drive you nuts, right?

1128
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,333
Bye. Thanks for coming.

1129
00:58:36,416 --> 00:58:38,416
- Don't antagonize them.
- I get nervous.

1130
00:58:39,166 --> 00:58:40,541
[Laser] Here, to the right.

1131
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,875
- We gotta go check on Grandma.
- Okay. Let's go.

1132
00:58:47,708 --> 00:58:49,916
[Grandma] Lydia,
would you say grace, please?

1133
00:58:50,916 --> 00:58:51,916
Yeah.

1134
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:58,750
Dear God, bless this food
and the hands that prepared it.

1135
00:58:58,833 --> 00:59:02,375
Uh, you know,
thanks for being super cool and stuff.

1136
00:59:02,458 --> 00:59:05,541
So, keep kicking butt and, uh, peace out.

1137
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:06,500
Amen.

1138
00:59:06,583 --> 00:59:07,625
- Amen.
- Amen.

1139
00:59:12,833 --> 00:59:14,250
Uh, Grandma,

1140
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:16,458
have you, um, given any more thought

1141
00:59:16,541 --> 00:59:18,750
to letting me get you a place
in a safer neighborhood?

1142
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:20,833
Why would I?

1143
00:59:20,916 --> 00:59:25,083
This has been my home for a long time,
and it'll do me until the end.

1144
00:59:25,166 --> 00:59:26,875
Please don't talk like that.

1145
00:59:26,958 --> 00:59:29,708
I dig it, Grandma. Morality, right?

1146
00:59:29,791 --> 00:59:31,291
It's mortality.

1147
00:59:31,375 --> 00:59:32,208
It's what?

1148
00:59:32,291 --> 00:59:34,000
- Mortality.
- That's what I said.

1149
00:59:34,083 --> 00:59:35,041
You said morality.

1150
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:37,208
- I'm... What are you saying?
- Mortality.

1151
00:59:37,291 --> 00:59:40,000
You're just putting extra Ts in it,
Morta-ta-ta-tality.

1152
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:45,833
I am so happy to see you girls
getting along again. So nice.

1153
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:49,041
- And where is my great-granddaughter?
- She's at work.

1154
00:59:49,125 --> 00:59:51,333
She's a hard worker just like her mom.

1155
00:59:53,166 --> 00:59:54,625
Can you keep a secret?

1156
00:59:54,708 --> 00:59:58,000
- You better not keep secrets from me.
- We shouldn't tell her.

1157
00:59:58,083 --> 01:00:01,791
Why not? We should probably tell somebody.
She probably knows.

1158
01:00:01,875 --> 01:00:02,916
- Lydia...
- We're...

1159
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,375
Oh, this is amazing.

1160
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:07,333
Oh, please let it be true.

1161
01:00:07,416 --> 01:00:10,416
- I have been praying for this day.
- Praying for what?

1162
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,375
- Really?
- [Grandma] For this moment.

1163
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:15,541
For you two
to tell me that you're a couple.

1164
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:18,083
I always knew
you were right for each other.

1165
01:00:18,166 --> 01:00:20,750
- [Lydia chuckling]
- [Grandma cooing]

1166
01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:22,791
[Lydia] Yeah, um…

1167
01:00:22,875 --> 01:00:24,083
Wow, that's…

1168
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:28,625
I have been saving it
for this very moment.

1169
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:32,125
[Grandma laughing happily]

1170
01:00:32,208 --> 01:00:35,791
- I've got Michelle Obama arms.
- You really do. Your arms look amazing.

1171
01:00:35,875 --> 01:00:36,750
Which one am I?

1172
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:39,083
Okay, you know…

1173
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:42,625
Uh, wow, that's a…
that's a lot to unpack.

1174
01:00:43,458 --> 01:00:45,458
[Lydia] You know,
I think we both prefer…

1175
01:00:46,875 --> 01:00:48,500
You know, dudes.

1176
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:52,875
- You don't have to look so disappointed.
- I can't help it.

1177
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:54,500
You could at least try.

1178
01:00:54,583 --> 01:00:57,666
What? Now? You gotta woo me.

1179
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:59,125
I thought that was it.

1180
01:00:59,208 --> 01:01:01,458
But if the secret is you're Thunder Force,

1181
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:04,583
you must think I don't watch the news.
You're a meme now.

1182
01:01:04,666 --> 01:01:05,500
Well…

1183
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:09,416
Uh, Grandma that's kind of why we're here.

1184
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:12,000
You could be in danger.

1185
01:01:12,083 --> 01:01:13,791
At least move into our building.

1186
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:17,958
- Even if it's just temporarily.
- I'm not going anywhere.

1187
01:01:18,916 --> 01:01:21,916
Those people out there killed my daughter,

1188
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,875
took your parents from you,
ruined this city.

1189
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:30,416
Now I want you two strong women

1190
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:31,916
to go out there,

1191
01:01:32,583 --> 01:01:35,708
kick butt like the superheroes you are,

1192
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:38,125
and you don't stop until the job is done.

1193
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:40,708
- Okay.
- And only on that day

1194
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:44,958
when the city is free from Miscreants,

1195
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:47,541
can you two have a wedding.

1196
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:50,291
- [Grandma laughing happily]
- Boom!

1197
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:53,791
- Come on, eat. It's getting cold.
- [overlapping chatter, laughter]

[crowd cheering, clapping]

1199
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,833
Hello, Chicago,
thank you for being here.

1200
01:01:57,916 --> 01:02:00,000
I won't take up too much of your time.

1201
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:01,750
I just want you to know…

1202
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:04,250
- No sign of Laser.
- [Tracy] <i>Keep your eyes open.</i>

1203
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:06,583
Whoo.

1204
01:02:07,208 --> 01:02:09,875
This suit is getting ripe.
I gotta wash it.

1205
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:12,166
- You can't wash it.
- Are you kidding?

1206
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:14,000
How am I supposed to keep it fresh?

1207
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,875
- I need to work on that.
- Yeah, you do.

1208
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:18,875
Quickly.

1209
01:02:18,958 --> 01:02:22,625

of every last one of you.

[all chanting] Rachel!

1212
01:02:28,666 --> 01:02:32,833
Let's give it up for our new super-team
who's out protecting our city every night.

1213
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:33,958
Thunder Force!

[cheering, applause]

1215
01:02:39,583 --> 01:02:41,333
How's it going, Chicago?

1216
01:02:42,583 --> 01:02:48,041
Exciting news, Thunder Force is available
for selfies for the low price of $100.

1217
01:02:48,125 --> 01:02:51,000
"What? That seems so cheap."
"It sure does."

1218
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:56,666
Um, we do not take selfies,
and if we did, they'd be free.

1219
01:02:58,208 --> 01:02:59,666
And they are free.

1220
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:03,000
They're free with a $100 donation.

1221
01:03:03,625 --> 01:03:07,333
- [crowd chanting] Thunder Force!
- [Lydia] Stop!

1222
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:09,916
Stop, stop, you guys, stop!

1223
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,166
We can't take it.
Now how do we roll, Chicago?

1224
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:15,416
- [crowd] Like thunder!
- How do we roll?

1225
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,041

1388
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:49,958
[Emily] Hey.

1389
01:11:52,458 --> 01:11:54,333
- What are you reading?
- Oh.

1390
01:11:54,416 --> 01:11:56,791
<i>Molecular Thermodynamics

1391
01:11:56,875 --> 01:11:58,541
Oh, I love that one.

1392
01:11:59,291 --> 01:12:01,333
- Can I read it after you finish?
- Sure.

1393
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:04,291
Are you okay, Mom?

1394
01:12:08,125 --> 01:12:09,125
Uh…

1395
01:12:11,333 --> 01:12:12,166
I'm, uh…

1396
01:12:12,666 --> 01:12:13,750
I'm okay, honey.

1397
01:12:14,666 --> 01:12:18,041
Just… working through
some stuff with Lydia.

1398
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:20,916
I know. She called me.

1399
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,250
Of course, she did.

1400
01:12:23,291 --> 01:12:27,041
- You guys get along okay, huh?
- I like her.

1401
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:30,916
She's weird and she's funny
and we talk about a lot of stuff.

1402
01:12:32,375 --> 01:12:34,333
You think I don't talk to you enough?

1403
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:36,875
Am I too tough on you?

1404
01:12:37,958 --> 01:12:42,291
I've just… I've always wanted
to make it so other people, so you…

1405
01:12:43,208 --> 01:12:45,541
- Didn't have to grow up the way I did.
- Afraid?

1406
01:12:45,625 --> 01:12:46,458
Yeah.

1407
01:12:48,291 --> 01:12:49,708
I'm so sorry, honey.

1408
01:12:51,125 --> 01:12:53,916
[Emily] I miss my mom and dad every day,

1409
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,875
but I've been so consumed
with righting a wrong that I've…

1410
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:02,333
Oh, I've missed out on
so much of our time together.

1411
01:13:02,416 --> 01:13:03,583
I'm gonna change that.

1412
01:13:03,666 --> 01:13:04,708
You do great.

1413
01:13:05,541 --> 01:13:07,541
You're too hard on yourself,

1414
01:13:07,625 --> 01:13:08,708
and Lydia too.

1415
01:13:08,791 --> 01:13:13,208
She's been your friend for a long time.
Even when you didn't want her to be.

1416
01:13:13,291 --> 01:13:14,500
[scoffs]

1417
01:13:14,583 --> 01:13:16,916
She's always been a bit of a hurricane.

1418
01:13:17,708 --> 01:13:19,916
- She's a good person.
- I know she is.

1419
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,333
But she threw a bus.

1420
01:13:21,416 --> 01:13:22,916
Yeah, but in her defense,

1421
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,625
she was trying
to stop the bad guys, right?

1422
01:13:25,708 --> 01:13:28,083
- She was.
- Also, she really wanted to throw a bus.

1423
01:13:28,166 --> 01:13:30,166
[both laughing]

1424
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:33,125
You're too much.

1425
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:36,333
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

1426
01:13:37,625 --> 01:13:40,083
- Did she say where she was going?
- On a date.

1427
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,166
That's Lydia for you.

1428
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:44,250
Always finding time to have fun.

1429
01:13:45,375 --> 01:13:48,125
[The Crab]
Swimming is what I try to focus on.

1430
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:49,291
- [Lydia] Is it?
- Yeah.

1431
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:51,125
[Lydia] You got the shoulders for it.

1432
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:56,041
I am very surprised
that you reached out to me.

1433
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:59,666
Especially since I thought
that you might be dead.

1434
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:01,916
It wasn't for lack of trying, right?

1435
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,666
That psycho Laser really
put her back into trying to kill us.

1436
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:07,791
It was a surprise
you made it out alive.

1437
01:14:07,875 --> 01:14:10,250
Lot of people don't live to tell the tale.

1438
01:14:10,333 --> 01:14:12,875
She just... She loves killing people.

1439
01:14:12,958 --> 01:14:14,625
Just loves it. So boring.

1440
01:14:14,708 --> 01:14:17,500
I guess I got lucky.
I'm built like a Sherman tank.

1441
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:19,833
- Mmm.
- The suits are very resilient.

1442
01:14:19,916 --> 01:14:22,291
I mean, they do not smell good.

1443
01:14:23,166 --> 01:14:26,208
Wow, they don't smell good.
But very resilient.

1444
01:14:26,291 --> 01:14:27,541
You smell good to me.

1445
01:14:27,625 --> 01:14:29,625
Yeah. Which, you know, is surprising,

1446
01:14:29,708 --> 01:14:32,125
'cause I don't have
a sense of smell that good,

1447
01:14:32,208 --> 01:14:35,625
ever since the, you know...
Since the accident.

1448
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:39,750
If it's not too… too much,
too soon, what happened?

1449
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:46,250
Oh, well, I was
on my honeymoon in Bermuda,

1450
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:47,875
and my then-wife,

1451
01:14:47,958 --> 01:14:51,583
she says, "Jer, how about
we go skinny-dip snorkeling?"

1452
01:14:51,666 --> 01:14:54,916
And, uh, I say,
"That sounds fun. Let's go buns up."

1453
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,625
We took off our clothes,
jumped in the water,

1454
01:14:57,708 --> 01:15:01,333
and what we didn't know is
we were over a radioactive coral reef.

1455
01:15:01,416 --> 01:15:02,500
Is that right?

1456
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:06,000
And up jumps a radioactive crab,
bites me in the genitals.

1457
01:15:06,583 --> 01:15:07,541
Oh, man.

1458
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:09,000
Rest is history.

1459
01:15:09,083 --> 01:15:11,083
- She immediately left me.
- Her loss.

1460
01:15:11,166 --> 01:15:13,583
Anyway, I went into a life of crime.

1461
01:15:14,083 --> 01:15:16,583
I don't know,
it brings up some kinda questions.

1462
01:15:16,666 --> 01:15:21,583
You tell me that story. Are you...
I mean, are you fully a Miscreant or…

1463
01:15:21,666 --> 01:15:22,916
Not crazy about labels.

1464
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,041
- But I do get that a lot.
- Yeah.

1465
01:15:25,125 --> 01:15:27,916
What I usually... I say I'm a Half-creant.

1466
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,583
- Half-Korean.
- Half-creant.

1467
01:15:30,166 --> 01:15:31,583
I thought you said half-Korean.

1468
01:15:31,666 --> 01:15:34,416
You're not the first one to...
Yeah, but no.

1469
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:38,916
Either one would be wildly interesting,
but Half-creant… I like that.

1470
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,333
Yeah. Yeah.

1471
01:15:40,416 --> 01:15:44,583
I thought we had a real nice connection
there at the liquor store.

1472
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:47,625
You know, I don't know if it's…

1473
01:15:47,708 --> 01:15:50,666
Because I got a lot of family
up and down the East Coast or…

1474
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:51,666
Oh, yeah?

1475
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:55,500
Maybe it's the smell
of Old Bay has always kind of…

1476
01:15:56,416 --> 01:15:58,166
Just done something to me.

1477
01:15:58,250 --> 01:15:59,833
Kind of made me warm and fuzzy.

1478
01:16:00,416 --> 01:16:01,708
It's a great smell.

1479
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:07,333
I look at you and I just think somewhere
inside those kind of yoked, strong…

1480
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:11,333
Glistening shells,

1481
01:16:11,416 --> 01:16:14,333
is the heart of a really good man-crab.

1482
01:16:15,208 --> 01:16:18,083
How about a toast, huh? To me, right?

1483
01:16:18,166 --> 01:16:19,541
- To you.
- Come here.

1484
01:16:20,666 --> 01:16:22,000
- It's...
- Hang on one sec.

1485
01:16:22,083 --> 01:16:24,458
- Can I get you a little...
- No, I'm not a child.

1486
01:16:24,541 --> 01:16:27,791
Sometimes I do need
to drink it like it's cocoa.

1487
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:30,833
- Yep. Me too.
- They're super powerful. But let's try it.

1488
01:16:30,916 --> 01:16:32,791
Cheers to me, huh?

1489
01:16:32,875 --> 01:16:33,833
- [shattering]
- Oh.

[Lydia] Show's over.

1494
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:43,250
I keep thinking I've got a handle on it.

1495
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:46,041
I should stick with shot glasses
and things get easier for me.

1496
01:16:46,708 --> 01:16:48,250
- Thank you.
- Thanks for that.

1497
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:50,625
You got a… a weak glass there.

1498
01:16:51,625 --> 01:16:54,625
Hey, there. Thank you, Carl.
We'll clean that right up.

1499
01:16:54,708 --> 01:16:56,916
Happens all the time.
Any decisions on food?

1500
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,583
- Well...
- If you're looking for suggestions,

1501
01:16:59,666 --> 01:17:03,583
my favorite appetizer to share,
personally, is the petite seafood tower.

1502
01:17:03,666 --> 01:17:04,791
It has everything.

1503
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:08,458
Has crab claws, Dungeness crab,
snow crab, tiger prawns...

1504
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:11,166
I didn't know we were
getting food and entertainment.

1505
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:13,083
- It is fun!
- Jimmy Jokes.

1506
01:17:13,166 --> 01:17:17,625
Hey, are you pitching the tower,
the seafood tower to a half-crab?

1507
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:20,958
- Jesus.
- Recommending that to me, huh? [laughs]

1508
01:17:21,041 --> 01:17:24,166
- That takes a lot of stones.
- What is this, the cannibal table?

1509
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:27,333
You gonna offer me
a 32-year-old woman named Lydia?

1510
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,458
Because I'm 32.

1511
01:17:29,541 --> 01:17:32,916
I believe it and I won't offer you that.
I'll be sensible next time.

1512
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,666
Connect with your guests better.

1513
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:37,291
I am so sorry, sir.
I didn't see your pincers.

1514
01:17:37,375 --> 01:17:39,458
[The Crab]
I apologize for raising my voice,

1515
01:17:39,541 --> 01:17:43,000
but I got bit on the ball bag
by a radioactive crab,

1516
01:17:43,083 --> 01:17:44,541
and I used to love shellfish.

1517
01:17:44,625 --> 01:17:48,291
So, my fuse is a little short.
This is a trigger environment for me.

1518
01:17:48,375 --> 01:17:49,416
- I understand.
- Okay.

1519
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:52,083
I'm gonna need a minute.
Why don't you take off?

1520
01:17:52,166 --> 01:17:53,000
No problem.

1521
01:17:53,708 --> 01:17:56,750
- They're just jealous.
- 'Cause of who I'm sitting with maybe.

1522
01:17:57,833 --> 01:17:59,750
Anything on that menu look good?

1523
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:01,291
I was thinking about chicken,

1524
01:18:01,375 --> 01:18:03,958
but I was afraid
you might be half-chicken.

1525
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:08,208
Ha. No, no. Just crab and man.

1526
01:18:08,291 --> 01:18:11,166
A lot of man.
I was gonna order the chicken too,

1527
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:14,916
but unfortunately, I like my chicken
the way you get it in the crab traps,

1528
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,500
- and that's raw.

1530
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:20,208
- What happened?
- I just got…

1531
01:18:25,125 --> 01:18:26,708
Do you like raw chicken, too?

1532
01:18:26,791 --> 01:18:28,041
Ever since…

1533
01:18:28,666 --> 01:18:30,500
Kind of what I've gone through,

1534
01:18:30,583 --> 01:18:33,916
physically, I've had a kind of insatiable…

1535
