Before we get started,
a little housekeeping.

this young man

as the dedicated

I'm not paying
for that cleanup.

Still it is my pleasure
to share with you

that just last week,
Rob Bilott was welcomed as a partner

here at Taft,
Stettinius & Hollister.

It's the Governor's office

calling for Mr. Burke.

42

May I help you?

Wilbur Tennant
calling on Robbie Bilott.

44
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,955
RONDELL: EPA has saddled them
with the whole bill

45
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,040
and given your client's
history at that site,

46
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,708
that's a real possibility.

47
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:38,171
- I'll take it back to them.
- Good. Tab 12, Middletown...

48
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,465
I know. I'm sorry.

49
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,134
- But they won't leave.
- Who's they?

50
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,179
I don't know.
They say they know you.

51
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,311
- Um...
- Robert Bilott?

52
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,231
Um, yes.

53
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,652
They call it a landfill.
A dump's what it is.

54
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,864
They told my brother and me
no chemicals, just trash.

55
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,198
But we ain't stupid.

56
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,034
I made them videotapes myself.
All the proof you need.

57
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,995
They're poisonin' the creek,
killing my animals.

58
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,122
- I'm in the middle of a meeting.
- So, I want a lawyer.

59
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,833
Every damn one in Parkersburg's
too yella to take my case.

60
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,626
Rob. He wants you
back in there.

61

They all scared shitless
at DuPont.

62
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,880
Well, I ain't scared
of nobody.

63
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,548
Okay.
Kathleen is my paralegal.

64
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,758
She's gonna give you
a directory of lawyers.

65
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,260
That's why
I called your grandma.

66
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,556
- What?
- My neighbor who tells me,

67
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,807
call Alma White.

68
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,477
Her grandson's some fancy environment
lawyer down in Cincinnati.

69
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:43,111
Sir, I am a corporate
defense attorney.

70
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,031
- So?
- I defend chemical companies.

71
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,992
- Well, now you can defend me.
- TOM: Rob!

72
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,245
Uh, 30 seconds, Tom.

73
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,123
- Uh, I'm sorry, Mr...
- Tennant.

74
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,250
I can offer you
a referral.

75
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,211
But I just don't see how I
can be of any help to you.

76
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,380
You can start by watching
them tapes for one thing.

77
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:03,965
Oh, let's go, Earl.

78
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,885
I'm sorry.
I... I wish you all the luck.

79
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,178
I don't need
your damn luck, boy!

80
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,638
- I need your help!
- TOM: Rob!

81
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,142
Come on.

82
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,401
I'm not arguing
with the overall analysis.

83
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,571
My only point is that
whatever we decide upon...

84
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,244
LAWYER: Thank you, gentlemen.

85
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,873
Do you know
where we're going?

86
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,668
There's a place
right around the corner.

87
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,836
- Yeah?
- What the hell was that all about?

88
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,423
- He knows my grandmother.
- Really?

89
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,884
Well, my mom's from
West Virginia.

90
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,844
Uh, from a town,
Parkersburg.

91
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,764
Not us. My...
my father was Air Force.

92
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,057
We...
We moved around a lot,

93
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,266
but we spent
the summers there.

94
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,644
- DOW LAWYER: Come on, Terp. You're buying.
- Of course I am.

95
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,231
You can be
from West Virginia, Rob.

96
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,525
I won't tell anyone.

97
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,408
TOM: All right, gentlemen.
Morton's it is.

98
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,537
Still deigned to eat
with us lowly associates?

99
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,749
You can't drive
an American car.

100
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,004
Taft-Hartley,
union busting?

101
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,755
We practically invented it.

102
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,048
"We?"

103
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,967
Besides, I know
a highly esteemed partner

104
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,135
who still drives American.

105
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,511
- Some real clunkers too.
- Okay,

106
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,346
yeah, but he
collects them.

107
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,140
That's different.
Like his

108
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,725
no-name college
and law school.

109
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:37,976
- No offense.
- Are you listening to this?

110
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,394
Hey, you guys go ahead,
all right?

111
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,397
- Look, I didn't mean anything by it.
- No. I gotta make a call.

112
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,481
It's all right.
I'll see you there.

113
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,941
Okay, we'll save you
a fish log.

114
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,030
- You can be such an asshole.
- JAMES: Karla, it was a joke.

115
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:51,906
- KARLA: Yeah.
- JAMES: We always joke.

116
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,825
KARLA: Oh, yeah. You guys are
a couple of jokesters.

reached the residence of Alma White.

119
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,631
I can't come to the phone
right now...

120
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,052
He's good. He's home
early tonight actually.

121

SARAH'S MOM: Tell him I
said, howdy, partner.

122
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,639
She says,
"Howdy, partner."

123
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,808
Are we ever gonna
see him again on Sundays?

124
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,935
Yes, he can still come
to Sunday dinners, Mom.

125
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,146
He's a partner,
not the President of the United States.

126
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,023
I wanna make...
Do you have my Bundt pan?

127
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,107
Returned it.

128
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,233
Where?
I looked under the counter.

129
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,694
It's the right hand cupboard,
in the plastic. Yeah.

130
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,572
Okay, well,
we just sat down.

131
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,656
All right, dear.

132
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,824
So, I gotta go.

133
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:35,909
Love to Rob and Teddy.

134
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,494
All right, see you Sunday.
Love to Dad.

135
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,578
Talk to you later.

136
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,913
Can you pretend to be
surprised about the cake?

137
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,331
She wants it
to be very special.

138
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,250
Oh, and the granite samples
came in.

139
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,794
Can you pick them up
on your way home tomorrow?

140
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,337
- Mmm.
- Rob?

141
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,713
Hmm? Uh, sure.

142
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,638
You okay?

143
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,098
Yes.

144
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,391
Bless us, our Lord
and thy gifts

145
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,102
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty

147
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,563
Thank you, God.
Thank you for our family.

263
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:45,059

you sort of an odd question?

264
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,477
Shoot.

265
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,146
Does the name
Wilbur Tennant ring a bell?

266
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,233
- Tennet, did you say?
- Tennant.

267
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,068
No. Not that I recall.

268
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,779
Mr. Tennant's a farmer
from West Virginia.

269
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,074
His property abuts one of
your landfills, Dry Run.

270
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,826
And his cows
have been getting sick.

271
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:05,996
He thinks possibly because of the
runoff from the landfill into his creek.

272
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,832
You're kidding me.
How did this come to you?

273
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,085
- KIM: Hey, Phil!
- He's a farmer. He's...

276
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,884
- Right. She knows the Tennants.
- So Grandma's on your back?

277
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,720
Something like that.
Anyway, uh...

278
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:25,558
The farmer said the EPA came out,
took a look around. I wondered...

279
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,601
- The name of the landfill again?
- Dry Run.

280
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,729
Dry Run. Dry...

281
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,022
You know, that does ring a
bell, now that you mention it.

282
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,941
We may have even sent
some folks out there.

283
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,152
If I remember correctly,
help EPA check it out.

284
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,488
That's gotta be it.
So, I'd love to share whatever came of that

285
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,615
with Mr. Tennant.
Help settle his nerves.

286
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,535
Absolutely. Soon as I'm back in
Wilmington, I'll take a look.

287
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,496
- Thanks, Phil. I really appreciate it.
- Happy to do it.

288
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,958
Now, let's get a drink and
toast you, my friend. You.

289
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,043

It repelled the elements,
especially water.

727

So they used it to make the first
ever waterproof coating for tanks.

of those companies.

So they took
this chemical, PFOA.

735
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,867
They renamed it C-8.

736
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:50,537
And they made their own
impenetrable coating,

737
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:53,248
but not for tanks. For pans.

738
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,627
They called it Teflon.

of American ingenuity,

740

00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:05,093
in Parkersburg, West Virginia.

742
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,223
But right from the start,
something wasn't right.

743
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:13,101
The men, and workers
who made Teflon

744
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:15,687
were coming down
with nausea, fevers.

745
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:17,189
DuPont wanted to know why.

746
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,526
So they laced cigarettes
with Teflon.

747
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:23,111
They told a group of their
workers, "Hey, smoke these."

748
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:25,739
DuPonters did
as they were told.

749
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,326
Almost all of those men
were hospitalized.

750
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:35,457
That's 1962.

751
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,962
One year after Teflon launched
and already DuPont knew.

752
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:44,258
The dust, they just sent right up the
smoke stacks, released into the air.

753
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,636
The sludge,
tossed it into the Ohio.

754
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:51,932
Or, uh, packed into drums and
chucked it into the Chesapeake.

755
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,893
But then their drums
started washing up.

756
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:57,813
So, DuPont starts
digging ditches

757
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,857
on the grounds
of the Washington Works plant.

758
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,192
And in those pits,
they dumped

759
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:05,863
thousands of tons
of toxic C-8 sludge and dust.

760
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:09,074
One of the men that they hired
to dig those ditches

761
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:11,827
was Wilbur Tennant's
brother Jim.

762
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:15,038
But they weren't the only ones
covering their tracks.

763
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:19,334
3M who pioneered these
chemicals for Scotchgard,

764
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:20,794
they were testing them
on monkeys.

765
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,754
Most of the monkeys died.

766
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,757
It wasn't like DuPont
didn't know that because

767
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:28,176
they were doing
their own tests on rats.

768
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,679
Watched their organs balloon.

769
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,765
Now the rats
are getting cancers.

770
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,978
Tested them on pregnant rats
and watched them give birth

771
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,355
to pups
with deformed eyes.

772
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,276
So, they yanked all the young
women off the Teflon line

773
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,028
and never told them why.

774
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:55,037
Sue Bailey's job was scrubbing
these huge steel vats

775
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,165

those deformities in the rats?

Oh, God.

780

Hey. Hi, Charlie.

784
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,863
ROB: So Sue goes to DuPont.

785
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:32,699
She says, "Why did you pull me
off the Teflon line?

786
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:38,121
"Did C-8 make my baby this
way?" "No," they tell her.

787
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:42,542
Then all of her records from
her time at Teflon disappear.

788
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:47,339
One year later,
they put all of the women back on Teflon

789
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:50,175
and never say a thing.

792
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:08,235
They knew that the C-8
they put into the air

793
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,320
and buried into the
ground for decades

794
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,072
was causing cancers.

795
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:15,909
They knew that their own workers
were getting these cancers.

796
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:19,037
They knew that the consumers
too were being exposed

797
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:22,457
and not just in Teflon.
In paints,

798
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:27,212
in fabrics, in,
uh, raincoats, boots.

799
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:30,298

800

ROB: For 40 years you knew
C-8 was poison.

801

You knew the "Happy Pan"
was a ticking time bomb.

802

And you knew exactly why.

803

Because C-8,
it stays in us forever.

804
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:48,316
Our bodies are incapable
of breaking it down.

805
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:53,196
And knowing all of this,
still you did nothing because

806
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,033
doing something,

807
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,870
"would essentially
put the long-term viability

808
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:03,957
"of this product's segment
on the line."

809
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,004
You were making
too much money.

810
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:13,133
One billion dollars a year just in
profits, just in Teflon.

811
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:17,971
And so you pumped
millions more pounds

812
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:21,224
of toxic C-8 into the air,
into the water

813
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:24,478
so much so you could
actually see it foam.

814
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:30,776
C-8 was everywhere. There was
nowhere left for you to contaminate.

815
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:37,074
And that's when
they came to Jim.

816

They knew he was sick and needed
the money and they needed his land.

817
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,207
And when they got it,
they dug up all the C-8

818
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:48,168
from every single pit
at Washington Works.

819
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,588
Fourteen million pounds
of toxic C-8 sludge

820
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:55,008
and they dumped it, again.
This time right up there.

from your house.

01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:39,907
"DuPont has advised
the district

939
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:43,036
"that it is confident
these levels are safe."

940
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:46,039
What the hell does that mean?

941
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:47,790
(BABY BABBLING)

942
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:49,792
JOE: A letter came last fall.

943
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:52,670
JAMES: Made no sense to me,
so I started making calls.

944
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:55,048
DARLENE: I told Joe don't
kick that hornet's nest.

945
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:58,301
It's not like we didn't know
what we'd signed up for.

946
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:00,720
SARAH: What do you mean?

947
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:03,473
Oh, I was married
before Joe

948
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:06,100
to a chemist
at DuPont.

949
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:08,436
Dream job.
Paid real well.

950
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:11,522
And the perks!
Presents for no reason.

951
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:15,068
We'd get this catalogue.
Just pick whatever you want.

952
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:17,320
And little stuff.

953
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:18,821
Like he'd bring home
this soap,

954
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:20,490
this miracle powder.

955
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:22,617
You puttin the washing
machine or the dishwasher,

956
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,619
just wipes stuff clean
like you would not believe.

957
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:28,122
One day he comes home
and says,

958
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:29,957
"Can't bring that stuff
home no more."

959
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:31,793
"Why?" Won't tell me.

960
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:34,337
Then he'd get sick
for weeks.

961
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:37,215
The Teflon flu,
the guys would call it.

962
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:40,093
We knew
something wasn't right.

963
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:43,429
But this house,
we bought it just by

964
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:46,599
showing the bank
my husband's DuPont ID.

965
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:49,977
Put both our kids
through college. Engineers.

966
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:54,315
In this town,
that doesn't come without a price.

967
01:09:54,649 --> 01:09:57,360
My brother Kenny
didn't know that price.

968
01:09:57,527 --> 01:09:59,570
He joined DuPont at 19.

969
01:09:59,654 --> 01:10:01,989
Died on the operating table
two years later.

970
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:05,535
- Ulcerative colitis.
- DARLENE: Just like Dan Schiller had.

971
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:06,911
Who's Dan?

972
01:10:07,078 --> 01:10:09,706
DARLENE: A chemist at DuPont.
Worked with my ex-husband.

973
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:12,917
JOE: And Roger,
what's his name?

974
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,502
DARLENE: Wilkins,
the foreman.

975
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,879
Steven Gellar.
Randy Field.

976
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:19,590
Randy's was kidney cancer.
He survived.

977
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:22,218
- His wife didn't.
- No, June's was thyroid.

978
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:23,886
It was supposed
to be treatable.

979
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:25,596
They didn't catch it
in time.

980
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,932
But they caught it
in their son.

981
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:32,061
ROB: Were your children
born healthy?

982
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:34,188
- Yes. Yes, they were.
- Good.

983
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:38,276
But we wanted
a third and couldn't.

984
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:39,569
I went to my doctor.

985
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:42,363
He says, "You need a hysterectomy.
You need it right away."

986
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,408
I'm so sorry.

987
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,076
Bad luck, I guess.

988
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:50,163
I was 36.

989
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:52,790
ROB: Mr. Kiger,

990
01:10:52,874 --> 01:10:55,084
you think I could get
a copy of that letter?

991
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:09,557
What's wrong
with your hand?

992
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,101
Nothing. It's fine.

993
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,983
Whoa, Rob?

994
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,820
Rob, what are you doing?

995
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:27,033
I mean, it's not enough
to poison these people?

996
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,534
They gotta swindle them too?

997
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:30,161
Okay, calm down. All right?

998
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:31,954
DuPont wrote that letter!

999
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:33,998
- Not the water authority.
- How do you know that?

1000
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:36,709
You think I don't know what a
DuPont letter looks like by now?

1001
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:38,127
Okay. Okay.

1002
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:39,754
I mean, Jesus!

1003
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:41,547
- (BABY CRYING)
- It's evil, Sarah.

1004
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:43,591
It's fucking evil!

1005
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:45,843
What's fack?

1006
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:47,887
Perfect.

1007
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,722
It's nothing, sweetie.
It's nothing. Oh, boy.

1008
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:51,474
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, honey.

1009
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:52,934
Can you give
Charlie the bottle, please?

1010
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:55,561
- Where's his bottle?
- It's in the bag.

1011
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,897
- What is all this?
- It's from Grammer's.

1012
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:00,358
It was left
in her mailbox.

1013
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:02,902
- "Medical claims, now and forever"?
- Here, bud.

1014
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,445
- "Now and forever."
- Is that that...

1015
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:05,613
That...

1016
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:08,366
Medical monitoring.
Is that...

1017
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:12,453
I thought you said
that wasn't gonna pass?

1018
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:17,583
- TOM: Morning.
- DAVID: Guys.

1019
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:26,926
ROB: Our lead plaintiff
is Mr. Joe Kiger.

1020
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:30,596
Potential plaintiff,
if the partnership approves.

1021
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,015
Mr. Joe Kiger,
a Phys Ed teacher

1022
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:35,226
from Parkersburg,
West Virginia.

1023
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:39,814
On behalf of
the 70,000 local residents,

1024
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:42,775
whose water
DuPont knowingly poisoned

1025
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:44,193
for the last 40 years.

1026
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:45,278
A class action?

1027
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,529
Let him finish.

1028
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,364
The Kigers were notified

1029
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:51,784
by their local water company
that DuPont had found

1030
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:55,663
small concentrations of C-8
in their water supply,

1031
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:57,206
but not to worry

1032
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:00,668
because those concentrations
were safe.

1033
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:03,671
Why?
Because DuPont said so.

1034
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:10,303
This is what DuPont
considers safe.

1035
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:13,180
That's something like
one drop of water

1036
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:15,349
in an Olympic size
swimming pool.

1037
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:17,935
In other words,
even a trace of C-8

1038
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:19,937
renders water unsafe.

1039
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:22,356
But DuPont told
the local water authority,

1040
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,482
"Don't worry.

1041
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:25,568
"Your wells have got even
less than that."

1042
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:27,737
- Except that was a lie.
- A lie?

1043
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:30,448
Yes. DuPont has been
secretly testing

1044
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:31,866
these wells for decades.

1045
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:34,911
They knew they had
contaminated those wells

1046
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:37,914
up to six times
that level.

1047
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:40,666
And thanks to the Tennant
case, now we know too.

1048
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,377
DAVID: Hold on. This stuff
is unregulated, right?

1049
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:45,004
I mean, as far as
EPA's concerned,

1050
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,131
it might as well
be rose petals.

1051
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:49,467
The EPA hasn't
set a standard, that's true,

1052
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,218
but DuPont did.

1053
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:54,263
And all the law requires
to win a case like this,

1054
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:56,599
is to show
that DuPont exceeded

1055
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:59,226
what DuPont itself
considers safe.

1056
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:00,603
Self-regulation.

1057
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:02,605
- MANAGING PARTNER: If what you're saying is right...
- It is right.

1058
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:06,067
...then why would DuPont tell this
water district anything at all?

1059
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,610
Seems to me
that they're being

1060
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:09,445
a good
corporate citizen here.

1061
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:12,865
That's how long
you have to file suit.

1062
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,575
One year from the moment

1063
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:17,203
you realize your water's
been contaminated.

1064
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:21,749
This letter looks like it's
telling people their water is safe.

1065
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:25,002
In fact, it's notifying them
that it isn't.

1066
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:26,754
DuPont has started the clock.

1067
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,255
DAVID: Smart.

1068
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:29,966
We would've
counseled that.

1069
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:32,093
ROB: It was sent
11 months ago.

1070
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:34,637
The moment they realized
we knew.

1071
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,515
In 30 days,
they're home free.

1072
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:40,184
So that's the proposed
case in brief.

1073
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:42,019
But there's something else
to consider.

1074
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:43,354
PARTNER: You think?

1075
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:44,730
Rob.

1076
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:47,733
C-8 bio-accumulates.
It builds up inside of us.

1077
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:50,403
Some class members
who aren't sick today

1078
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:53,114
will get sick tomorrow.

1079
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:55,950
We need a way to protect
them into the future.

1080
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:58,077
Jesus, Tom! If you're even thinking
about using medical monitoring...

1081
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,496
Hold on. Hold on.

1082
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:04,208
Medical monitoring
is a claim now permitted

1083
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:05,501
in West Virginia courts.

1084
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:07,545
- PARTNER: Oh, come on.
- Let's hear him out.

1085
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:10,297
It say if a company
exposes a community

1086
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:12,008
to something
that makes them sick,

1087
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:15,302
they must monitor the health
of that community indefinitely.

1088
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:19,265
Everybody get that? You're creating
liability from mere exposure.

1089
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:21,058
It's also unprecedented.

1090
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:23,269
Exactly!
Which is why not six months ago,

1091
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:25,021
we fought tooth and nail
against it.

1092
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:27,815
And you lost.
Our clients have the right

1093
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:29,734
to avail themselves
of the law.

1094
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:32,319
Potential clients.

1095
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:37,491
JAMES: Okay.

1096
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:41,412
I know you, Rob.
I know your passion.

1097
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:44,415
You got a great settlement
for your farmer.

1098
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:45,833
You should be proud of that.

1099
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:50,379
And perhaps as the newest
partner at this table,

1100
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:52,006
I should be
more circumspect.

1101
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:56,177
But what he's
proposing here is

1102
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:59,055
nothing less
than a shakedown

1103
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:02,141
- of an iconic American company.
- We do not represent DuPont.

1104
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,310
No, you don't
represent anyone.

1105
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:07,813
Is this what
we have become?

1106
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:10,649
Plaintiff's attorneys.
Ambulance chasers.

1107
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:12,651
Why don't you just admit it?
Rob, you wanna flip.

1108
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:14,862
You wanna take everything
that you know

1109
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:17,364
about how
chemical companies operate

1110
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:19,909
and turn it against DuPont.
Like an informant.

1111
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:21,077
- That's enough.
- JAMES: Isn't that right?

1112
01:16:21,202 --> 01:16:22,536
- TOM: Okay!
- Isn't that right?

1113
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:23,996
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.

1114
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:27,958
Okay, then, I...
I say we take a vote

1115
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:30,169
and determine whether or not

1116
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:31,754
we continue
in the tradition

1117
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:34,173
that has distinguished this
firm from everyone else...

1118
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,717
TOM: Okay, I'm running
this meeting. Okay?

1119
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:38,385
You got that?

1120
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:41,055
Has anyone even read
the evidence

1121
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:42,223
this man has collected?

1122
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:45,726
The willful negligence,
the corruption?

1123
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:48,187
Read it!

1124
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:50,856
And then tell me we should
be sitting on our asses!

1125
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:55,528
That's the reason
why Americans hate lawyers.

1126
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,365
This is the crap that fuels
the Ralph Naders of the world.

1127
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,159
We should want
to nail DuPont.

1128
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:04,995
All of us should!

1129
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:07,289
American business is better
than this, gentlemen.

1130
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:10,000
And when it's not,
we should hold them to it.

1131
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:12,169
That's how you build
faith in the system.

1132
01:17:13,546 --> 01:17:16,298
We're always arguing
that companies are people.

1133
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:20,803
Well, these people
have crossed the line!

1134
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:23,597
To hell with them!

1135

as a surprise

01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:31,814
to corporate defense types
like yourselves,

1137
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:33,774
but there's more to the law
than just flooding

1138
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:35,442
the other side in papers.

1139
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:38,737
From where I sit,
you have to touch people.

1140
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,407
These girls,
they handle the calls

1141
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:43,659
from the
class action members.

1142
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:46,203
And there's thousands of 'em
on any given case.

1143
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:49,915
And it's here that we come
to know their pain.

1144
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,542
Isn't that right, Hazel?

1145
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:54,920
Yes. We hear it every day

1146
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:58,174
and it's my job to make
a jury feel that pain.

1147
01:17:58,257 --> 01:18:00,759
Not out of pity,
but out of fear.

1148

Whatever it is
that happened to my client,

1149
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:05,514
that juror has to think,

1150
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:08,100
"That could happen to me."

1151

they have to live with it.

1156
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:20,154
HARRY: Yeah, I think
we can relax, Rob,

1157
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:23,490
though, there's no way they're gonna
prevail with a motion to dismiss.

1158
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:25,159
This is procedural.

1159
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:27,411
It's nonsense.
We'll get a trial today.

Yes, I've heard of it.

- Your motion.
- Thank you.

1185

Your Honor, we're here today because
of a uniquely American invention.

Teflon.

1187

Since 1961, Teflon
has liberated housewives...

that DuPont

01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:27,406
did not meet
its own standard of safety

1194

with regard to
the level of C-8

in the local water supply.

1196
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:33,579
That's irrelevant,
Your Honor.

1197
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:35,664
We ask you to dismiss
on grounds

1198
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:37,666
that the only standard
that matters,

1199

is the one that elected
government deems safe.

ROB: Not if it's unregulated.

1201

It's government's job
to make these determinations.

Is there a problem,
Mr. Deitzler?

Apologies, Your Honor,

1207
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:55,517
but DuPont has been hiding
the dangers of this chemical

from the government
for a while now.

And they're asking you
to let them off the hook

because they've succeeded
in their strategy.

1376

that in 1981

1377
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:59,477
3M notified DuPont that it
had conducted studies on rats.

1378
01:29:59,561 --> 01:30:00,979
And these studies showed

1379
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:04,900
that sustained C-8 exposure
can cause facial deformities?

1380
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:06,735
I'm not aware
of a study by 3M.

1381
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:11,406
How about DuPont's own studies that
showed the same thing in humans?

1382
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:18,288
That's DuPont's
pregnancy study from 1981.

1383
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:20,165
Does that look like
a DuPont document to you?

1384
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:21,333
It looks to be.

1385
01:30:23,376 --> 01:30:27,047
Are you aware that DuPont has
denied that any such study

1386
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:29,591
ever even took place?

1387
01:30:30,884 --> 01:30:33,553
I'm not familiar with specific
statements we've made about that.

in agency history against
the chemical giant, DuPont.

to report the health dangers of C-8

challenging issue. Medical monitoring.

1421
01:33:53,837 --> 01:33:56,923
We've agreed to establish
an independent science panel

comprised of three scientists who
have no relationship to either side.

1423
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:05,849
This independent panel will
study the members of this Class

1424
01:34:05,932 --> 01:34:09,769
to determine whether C-8 exposure
has led to increased incidents

of disease in this region.

1426
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:15,483
If the panel finds that there
are probable scientific links

1427
01:34:15,567 --> 01:34:18,987
to a particular disease,
the health of everyone in the Class

1428
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:22,991
will be monitored for
that disease in perpetuity

up to 235 million.

And any Class member
who develops that disease

can sue DuPont for damages.

We trusted you, Rob.
We put our faith in you.

- All right? (HANGS UP)

kind of a progress report?

Anything that I can
share with these folks?

I'm sorry, Mr. Bilott.

01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:12,001
The Panel is still
in the process of

1555
01:42:12,084 --> 01:42:14,003
analyzing complex data
and modeling

1556
01:42:14,086 --> 01:42:16,839
from thousands of samples
and medical histories.

Where did you learn that?

1562
01:42:39,195 --> 01:42:41,947
He told me that
Mary Magdalene was a hooker.

1563
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:46,869
- What? She was.
- You're supposed to say prostitute.

she found God

and became one of Jesus's
most fervent disciples.

- No.

01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:26,552
Because I knew that
you needed something.

1589

Something.

Of course not.

Your memo.

It was just a fine, Tom.
It's a fine. Sixteen million.

1610
01:45:34,203 --> 01:45:37,039
It's... It's nothing for these people.
It's pocket change.

Yes, but if they get charged with
criminal concealment, game over.

- You said DOJ was investigating.
- Not anymore.

- What?
- They dropped the investigation.

- They dropped... What?
- They dropped it. No reason given.

This case,
it's the only hope we have.

They know that, and they're
trying to make it as expensive

as they can to force you
to make me stop.

could be a huge payout here...

I'm in this for money?

but you're gonna have to
take another pay cut.

1632
01:46:48,193 --> 01:46:51,113
Tom, that's...
That's my fourth pay cut.

01:47:35,783 --> 01:47:38,452

- Mrs. Bilott?
- Yes.

1649
01:47:43,791 --> 01:47:47,002
We think your husband's
most likely experienced a TIA.

1650
01:47:47,086 --> 01:47:49,296
A transient ischemic attack.

1651
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:53,801
Blood is briefly cut off to the brain,
mimicking the symptoms of a stroke.

1652
01:47:55,302 --> 01:47:59,306
Uh, excuse me. A TIA?
This wasn't short.

01:48:05,771 --> 01:48:08,023
Could someone
be poisoning him?

1657
01:48:08,107 --> 01:48:11,443
No, Mrs. Bilott.
This is neurological.

1658
01:48:12,111 --> 01:48:13,737
You just said
it wasn't a stroke.

1659
01:48:13,821 --> 01:48:15,614
Well, not this time.

1660
01:48:15,698 --> 01:48:17,241
- What does that mean?
- Well, it means that

1661
01:48:17,366 --> 01:48:19,368
- he needs to never miss his medication.
- Mmm-hmm.

1662
01:48:19,451 --> 01:48:22,621
And needs to reduce all
sources of stress in his life.

1663
01:48:22,955 --> 01:48:25,290
(EXHALES) He's under
enormous pressure at work.

1664
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,211
Well, that needs to change.
But he's a young man.

1665
01:48:29,294 --> 01:48:30,671
He shouldn't be
having these incidences.

1666
01:48:32,381 --> 01:48:34,341
He's sedated, but
you can see him.

1667

01:48:45,310 --> 01:48:47,896
I'll give you
some privacy.

Anything you
need, call me.

1670
01:48:56,030 --> 01:48:58,741
I need you to stop making
him feel like a failure.

1671
01:49:05,205 --> 01:49:09,084
I appreciate the stress that your
family must be going through.

Please don't talk to
me like I'm the wife.

01:49:16,383 --> 01:49:19,595
Did Rob ever tell you about
moving around as a kid?

1674
01:49:20,387 --> 01:49:21,930
I...

1675
01:49:22,014 --> 01:49:24,725
Ten times before
senior year.

1676
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:26,852
No friends,
no ties, no...

1677
01:49:26,935 --> 01:49:29,480
Just him, his sister,
his folks.

1678
01:49:31,565 --> 01:49:33,817
Then I came along and
you came along and...

1679
01:49:36,278 --> 01:49:38,489
Taft, it's not
just a job.

1680
01:49:38,572 --> 01:49:41,492
To him it's...
It's home.

1681
01:49:45,245 --> 01:49:47,790
And he was willing
to risk all that

1682
01:49:48,082 --> 01:49:50,626
for a stranger who
needed his help.

1683
01:49:52,127 --> 01:49:57,132
Now, you and I may
not know what that is,

1684
01:49:59,343 --> 01:50:01,261
but it's not failure.

1685
01:50:35,587 --> 01:50:39,842
(SINGING) Lord, you have
searched my heart

1686
01:50:40,259 --> 01:50:45,264
PARISHIONERS: (SINGING) And you
know when I sit and when I stand

1687
01:50:45,764 --> 01:50:48,976
Your hand is upon me

1688
01:50:49,059 --> 01:50:52,521
Protecting me from death

1689
01:50:52,688 --> 01:50:57,818
Keeping me from harm

1690
01:50:59,736 --> 01:51:05,909
Oh, Lord, I know
you are near

1691
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:15,252
Standing always at

1692
01:51:15,335 --> 01:51:18,505
My side

1693
01:51:45,741 --> 01:51:48,035
BAILEY: Hey, do you
know the score?

1694
01:51:49,328 --> 01:51:53,040
The game? Sorry,
my radio's busted.

1695
01:51:54,666 --> 01:51:55,959
Sorry.

1696
01:51:56,251 --> 01:51:58,212
Don't worry about it.
It'll be a surprise.

1697
01:51:58,503 --> 01:52:00,172
Bucky, come on.

I'm the new comptroller

- Hello?
- DR. FRANK: Mr. Bilott?

1706
01:54:13,513 --> 01:54:14,681
Yes?

1707
01:54:14,765 --> 01:54:17,934
I guess I should start
by apologizing for taking...

1708
01:54:18,352 --> 01:54:20,604
well, seven years to call you.

1709
01:54:20,687 --> 01:54:22,689
- Who is this?
- Oh, yes, of course.

1710
01:54:22,814 --> 01:54:26,568
- It's Dr. Karen Frank from the...
- Science Panel?

1711
01:54:27,944 --> 01:54:31,740
Again, I'm so sorry to have kept
you waiting this long, Mr. Bilott.

1712
01:54:32,115 --> 01:54:34,868
- But there was just so much data...
- Please, Doctor, please,

1713
01:54:35,202 --> 01:54:36,203
can you...

1714
01:54:36,286 --> 01:54:38,497
Would just please
tell me what's happened?

1715
01:54:38,580 --> 01:54:41,291
What's happening?
What you've found out?

1716
01:54:41,375 --> 01:54:44,711
Yes. You gave us an
unprecedented amount of data.

1717
01:54:45,295 --> 01:54:48,298
The largest epidemiological
study in human history.

1718
01:54:49,049 --> 01:54:53,136
It's irrefutable.
We have linked sustained exposure to C-8

1719
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:56,765
to six categories of
serious illness.

1720

high cholesterol,
ulcerative colitis.

1723
01:55:12,322 --> 01:55:16,118
3,635 people in the Class
already have these diseases.

1724
01:55:17,035 --> 01:55:18,829
Many more will
develop them.

1725
01:55:20,831 --> 01:55:24,167
Thanks to you the entire
Class will be monitored...

01:55:24,251 --> 01:55:27,546
and those who get sick
can seek restitution.

You did a good thing here,
Mr. Bilott. You did good.

- Which part?
- All of it.

They're tearing up

Rejecting the
Science Panel.

1737

They're gonna fight
every claim in court.

Thousands of claims.
People, sick people, they'll give up.

They can't
fight DuPont!

How can they
go back on...

Nothing else matters.

They can fight
you all they want.

1746
01:58:12,669 --> 01:58:14,337
It doesn't take away
from what you've done!

1747
01:58:14,421 --> 01:58:17,674
Of course, it does.
That's exactly what it does!

01:58:19,217 --> 01:58:21,344
They want to show the world
that it's no use fighting.

even he can't crack the maze

it'll protect us,
