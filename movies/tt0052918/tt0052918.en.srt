Everybody in here an actor?
Just about.

300
00:18:44,961 --> 00:18:47,623
So far you're the only one
I really believe.

301
00:18:47,697 --> 00:18:52,259
Thank you. Only so far,
you're the only one
in New York who does.

302
00:18:52,335 --> 00:18:55,327
But someday I'm going to
make them all feel that way.

303
00:18:55,405 --> 00:18:59,933
Aren't you a little late
getting started?
I mean, it's...

304
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:04,208
Yes, five years late.
That's why every day counts.

305
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:08,843
Why the five-year lapse?
My husband was
in the theater too.

306
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:12,150
A director.
A good director.

307
00:19:12,222 --> 00:19:14,850
Everything I know
I owe to him.

308
00:19:14,925 --> 00:19:18,827
It was a small town,
a little theater,
but professional.

309
00:19:18,895 --> 00:19:23,195
When he died,
I had to make a living
doing something else.

310
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:26,258
I never really wanted
anything but the stage.

311
00:19:26,336 --> 00:19:28,395
Oh, except Susie.

312
00:19:28,472 --> 00:19:31,839
So, it took me five years
to save enough money
to come to New York.

313
00:19:31,908 --> 00:19:33,967
But you did it.
Mm-hmm.

314
00:19:34,044 --> 00:19:37,070
And I'm going to be an
actress, an important one...
<i>[Woman] Lora? </i>

315
00:19:37,147 --> 00:19:39,081
[Woman]
Lora.
Oh, excuse me.

316
00:19:39,149 --> 00:19:41,447
Nothing in it for me,
honey,

317
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:44,885
but they're
beginning to cast a new
Tennessee Williams play.

318
00:19:44,955 --> 00:19:47,890
Oh, what agent?
Allen Loomis... today.

319
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,791
So put on
your roller skates.
Oh, thanks, Fay.

320
00:19:51,928 --> 00:19:53,862
Coffee?
I'm sorry,
but I've got to go.

321
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,864
You haven't eaten.
You go ahead.
Good-bye.

322
00:19:55,932 --> 00:19:57,866
How about dinner?
Tonight?
We'll take Susie.

323
00:19:57,934 --> 00:19:59,902
Fine.
Where?

324
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,938
Come and have
dinner with us.
All right.

325
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:03,939
Good luck.
Thanks, Fay.

326
00:20:12,448 --> 00:20:15,781
But when can I have
an appointment?

327
00:20:15,852 --> 00:20:20,619
[Sighing]
How about a week
from today? Thursday.

328
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,218
Put me down.
It's Iris Dawn.
Don't forget it.

329
00:20:25,294 --> 00:20:27,228
Tsk.

330
00:20:27,296 --> 00:20:29,696
I'm sorry to add
to your troubles, but...

331
00:20:29,765 --> 00:20:32,359
I'm afraid I'm a little late
for my appointment.

332
00:20:32,435 --> 00:20:35,632
Name, please.
Miss Meredith.

333
00:20:35,705 --> 00:20:38,003
Mered...
Meredith.

334
00:20:38,074 --> 00:20:40,042
Well, I don't seem
to have you down.

335
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:43,203
Never mind.
Just tell Mr. Loomis
that Robert Hayes sent me.

336
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,680
Robert Hayes?
<i>From International</i>
<i>Studio. </i>

337
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:50,150
It's probably just a slipup
from the coast, but, uh,

338
00:20:50,219 --> 00:20:52,153
Mr. Hayes won't
like it at all.

339
00:20:52,221 --> 00:20:54,883
<i>I hope you didn't</i>
<i>slip up. </i>
Me?

340
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:58,586
Well, if you say
there's no appointment,
um, good-bye.

341
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:00,720
Well, just a second.

342
00:21:00,796 --> 00:21:05,233
Why don't you sit down
and I'll see if I can
straighten this out?

343
00:21:05,301 --> 00:21:07,496
Thank you.

344
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,504
Mr. Loomis?
Yes?

345
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:11,665
There's a Miss Meredith here
from Hollywood.

346
00:21:11,741 --> 00:21:15,268
<i>[Receptionist Whispering]</i>
<i>Yes, quite lovely. </i>

347
00:21:15,344 --> 00:21:19,747
Think we should
send her away?
No. I think
you ought to see her.

348
00:21:19,815 --> 00:21:22,409
Fine.
Okay.

349
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:27,888
Miss Meredith?
You can go in now.

350
00:21:32,128 --> 00:21:35,222
Um, just right in.

351
00:21:35,298 --> 00:21:37,357
Robert sends
his warmest greetings.

352
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:40,800
Well, thanks.
And how is he?
Marvelous.

353
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:44,328
He's lost 15 pounds.
You know what an effort
that is for him.

354
00:21:44,407 --> 00:21:46,875
And, uh, what can
I do for you?

355
00:21:46,943 --> 00:21:52,006
Robert thought I shouldn't
do any more pictures before
I did a show on Broadway.

356
00:21:52,081 --> 00:21:54,208
Very sensible.
<i>I'm glad</i>
<i>you think so too. </i>

357
00:21:54,283 --> 00:21:58,617
That's why Robert
sent me to you.
He thought I'd get more...

358
00:21:58,688 --> 00:22:01,555
personal attention
from you.

359
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:04,889
He could be right there.
You mind?
<i>No. </i>

360
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:07,555
Incidentally, how's the new
Tennessee Williams play?

361
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:13,034
Bound to be a blockbuster,
but all cast.
<i>[Buzzer Buzzing]</i>

362
00:22:13,102 --> 00:22:16,833
Hello? Oh, Lillian!
What?

363
00:22:16,906 --> 00:22:20,069
<i>Oh, well, </i>
<i>can't you break it? </i>

364
00:22:20,142 --> 00:22:22,610
<i>Oh. No, I don't mind. </i>

365
00:22:22,678 --> 00:22:26,808
I don't mind you
standing me up. I'm fine.
I'll just kill myself.

366
00:22:26,882 --> 00:22:28,816
Yeah.

367
00:22:28,884 --> 00:22:34,151
<i>Never be a bachelor. </i>
<i>There's no security. </i>
I know how you feel.

368
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:37,659
Yeah? Say, how'd you like
to go with me tonight?

369
00:22:37,727 --> 00:22:40,161
I'm afraid I can't.

370
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:42,322
Big party.
Lots of important people.

371
00:22:42,398 --> 00:22:47,131
Well, I could see if I could
break a couple of engagements.

372
00:22:47,203 --> 00:22:49,137
I'll call my place.

373
00:22:49,205 --> 00:22:51,469
I'll call.
What's the number?

374
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,236
Montgomery,

375
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,278
76120.

376
00:22:56,345 --> 00:22:59,473

<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

378
00:23:02,518 --> 00:23:04,816
Miss Meredith's residence.

379
00:23:04,887 --> 00:23:07,617
Oh, this <i>is</i>
Miss Meredith's residence?

380
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,456
That'll be Annie, my maid.
I'll talk to her.

381
00:23:15,931 --> 00:23:20,493
Annie, uh, call
the Waldorf and tell, um,

382
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:23,800
you-know-who I cannot have
cocktails and dinner with him.

383
00:23:23,873 --> 00:23:28,503
Uh, I know who?
Oh, yes, Miss Lora,
I'll do that.

384
00:23:28,577 --> 00:23:31,045
Thank you.

385
00:23:31,113 --> 00:23:33,138
Well, Mr. Loomis,
it looks like I'm free.

386
00:23:33,215 --> 00:23:36,480
That'll be just fine.
Should be an interesting
evening for me.

387
00:23:36,552 --> 00:23:40,488
Hollywood actress and...
Oh, that reminds me.
Excuse me.

<i>[Receptionist]</i>
<i>Yes, Mr. Loomis? </i>

Annette, get me Hollywood,
Mr. Robert Hayes.

390
00:23:45,194 --> 00:23:49,130
International Studios,
right? International...
Um.

391
00:23:49,198 --> 00:23:52,565
Maybe you better not
go through with that call.

392
00:23:52,635 --> 00:23:55,763
You don't think so?
Why not?

393
00:23:55,838 --> 00:23:57,829
[Sighing]

394
00:23:57,907 --> 00:24:00,967
Because Robert Hayes
doesn't exist.

395
00:24:01,043 --> 00:24:05,537
I understand.
Annette, cancel the call.

396
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:07,548
<i>Yes, Mr. Loomis. </i>
I was desperate.

397
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:11,552
You were pretty good.
You lied. All actresses lie.
I know that.

398
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,646
But I believed you.
I'm sorry.

399
00:24:14,723 --> 00:24:18,022
Don't leave.
You took me in.

400
00:24:18,094 --> 00:24:21,029
For all of 20 seconds,
you took me in,
but I don't mind.

401
00:24:21,097 --> 00:24:25,431
It was a good acting job,
and you're very pretty.

402
00:24:25,501 --> 00:24:28,061
Now, about tonight.
Shall I pick you up?

403
00:24:28,137 --> 00:24:31,698
Um, no, it'll be easier
for me to meet you here.

404
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:35,835
8:00?
You'll find me
very prompt, Mr. Loomis.

405
00:24:50,926 --> 00:24:54,259
[Gate Thumping]

406
00:24:59,568 --> 00:25:01,502
Come on in.

407
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:05,597
Sit down. I just have
a few letters to sign.

408
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:07,835
Oh, drink?
No, thank you.

409
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:12,210
But aren't we going
to be late to the party?
Plenty of time, plenty.

410
00:25:12,281 --> 00:25:15,910
And I need a drink.
So relax.

411

<i>Say, you're not allergic</i>
<i>to mink, are you? </i>

Mink? No,
I don't think so.
<i>Good. </i>

But whose is it?
Mine. And I only loan it
to very special clients.

415
00:25:35,504 --> 00:25:37,699
I want you to wear it
tonight.
You want me to wear...

416
00:25:37,773 --> 00:25:39,707
Please. Got to think
of my reputation.

417
00:25:39,775 --> 00:25:43,711
I haven't been seen
with a girl without a mink
since the heat wave of'39.

418
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:46,179
Come on.

419
00:25:46,248 --> 00:25:49,547
We should spend
a little time talking
about our future.

420
00:25:49,618 --> 00:25:52,985
You can act. Well,
that's of no importance
at the moment.

421
00:25:53,055 --> 00:25:55,888
The main thing is,
you're a beaut.

422
00:25:55,958 --> 00:26:00,019
Please, don't.
Oh, and you're decent too.

No doubt possess
some fine principles.

424
00:26:02,131 --> 00:26:04,395
Well, me, I'm a man
of very few principles,

425
00:26:04,466 --> 00:26:06,900
and they're all open
to revision.

426
00:26:06,969 --> 00:26:09,494
But I'm in a position
to do something for you.

427
00:26:09,572 --> 00:26:12,564
You'll get 10% of everything
I make. Isn't that enough?

428
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:15,132
No. Now,
sit down and listen.

429
00:26:16,946 --> 00:26:21,883
Here it is, short and clear.
You're not a chicken.

430
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:23,942
You're no high-hearted kid
out of some drama school,

431
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:26,078
wanting to do or die
for dear old Thespis.

432
00:26:26,155 --> 00:26:28,146
<i>And you're beginning</i>
<i>under a handicap. </i>

433
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:31,057
I know I'm starting late.
<i>So time isn't on your side. </i>

434
00:26:31,126 --> 00:26:33,594
But you do have
some qualifications.

435
00:26:33,662 --> 00:26:37,962
Your face will pass.
You've good, nice, long
silky legs. I like them.

436
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:40,524
You have a chest full
of quality and quantity.
I like it.

437
00:26:40,603 --> 00:26:44,801
Aren't you taking
a few things for granted?
Me? I don't count.

438
00:26:44,873 --> 00:26:47,808
But there are certain
people who do, and you're
going to meet all of them.

439
00:26:47,876 --> 00:26:50,811
That is, if you're really
serious about your career.

440
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:54,440
I am, but...
Good, then you're going
every place with me.

441
00:26:54,516 --> 00:26:57,280
Every party, opening night,
every saloon in town.

442
00:26:57,353 --> 00:27:00,322
With a complete new
wardrobe at my expense.

443
00:27:00,389 --> 00:27:02,289
Oh, it's tax deductible.

444
00:27:02,358 --> 00:27:04,918
This is a tough,
competitive racket.

445
00:27:04,994 --> 00:27:07,929
Although it's a lot
more than any agent
is supposed to do,

446

I'd do it.

447

What's this got
to do with acting?
Nothing.

448

But I'll show you how to
realize your ambitions,
if you do as I say.

449
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:20,934
If the dramatists' club wants
to eat and sleep with you,
you eat and sleep with them.

450
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:24,138
If some producer with a hand
as cold as a toad wants to do
a painting of you in the nude,

451
00:27:24,213 --> 00:27:26,147
you'll accommodate him
for a very small part.

452
00:27:26,215 --> 00:27:28,547
It's disgusting!
It pays off.

453
00:27:28,617 --> 00:27:30,551
You're disgusting.
Maybe I am.

454
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:34,555
But let me assure you,
once you get it made,

455
00:27:34,623 --> 00:27:37,490
you can be idealistic
all of ten seconds
before you die.

456

You're trying to cheapen me.
But you won't. Not me.

we get $10 off our rent.

Is that a fact?

465
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,299

and got a job while
the kids are at school.

466

Doing shirts

How'd everything go?

471

Oh, just fine. I went
to the 21 with Mr. Loomis.

472
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,036
Everybody there
was somebody exciting.

473
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,806
For the first time,
I felt that I was somebody too.

474
00:29:04,879 --> 00:29:06,904
Is Mr. Loomis gonna
find you a job?

475

he wanted to represent me,

But l...
Oh, Annie.

478

What's wrong, Miss Lora?
[Crying]

479

Everything. Everything.

Everything will work out.

482
00:29:46,054 --> 00:29:49,182
Can I help in any way?
No.

483
00:29:49,257 --> 00:29:52,158
No one can.

484

No one.

485

I'm so ashamed.

486
00:29:58,733 --> 00:30:01,861
It was horrible.

487

He tried to make me
feel so cheap.

You could never
be cheap.

You don't know

Yes, I do.

It happens all the time.
Not just in the theater.

I love the theater.
It's what I want.

But they seem so stale
after tonight.

So stale I can't believe
in them anymore.

M-Maybe I'm a fool.

496

and not as
I want them to be.

If I know you,
they'll have to be

Just a little experiment.

507

Experiment?
Sarah Jane's fault.

508
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:52,570
After class, one of the kids
said that Negro blood
was different.

509
00:31:52,647 --> 00:31:56,674
So later this evenin',
Sarah Jane wanted to compare
her blood with Susie's.

510
00:31:56,751 --> 00:31:59,345
Well, I spanked her good.

Why should I tell them?

00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,703
I love you.

593
00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:33,441
But, darling, you're...

594
00:37:33,515 --> 00:37:36,609
You're just
getting started and...

595
00:37:36,685 --> 00:37:38,619
It would be foolish.

596
00:37:38,687 --> 00:37:41,178
At least we'd
be foolish together.

597
00:37:41,256 --> 00:37:44,123
But marriage
is such a big step.

598
00:37:44,193 --> 00:37:47,890
I want us to be together.
Well, we are,
most of the time.

599
00:37:47,963 --> 00:37:50,591
Most of the time
you're out fighting
to get somewhere.

600
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:52,634
Breaking your heart,
trying to do for
yourself and Susie...

601
00:37:52,701 --> 00:37:55,226
what I want to do for you,
what I finally
can do for you.

602
00:37:55,304 --> 00:37:58,705
Pardon me. I'm sorry.
Pardon me.
Oh!

603
00:37:58,774 --> 00:38:01,299
Well, wait a minute.

604
00:38:02,878 --> 00:38:07,474
I want to give you a home,
take care of you, love you.

605
00:38:07,549 --> 00:38:11,883
Oh, Steve, you
don't know me at all.

606
00:38:11,954 --> 00:38:14,149
I still love the theater.

607
00:38:14,223 --> 00:38:16,919
You tried it
and it's only hurt you.

608
00:38:16,992 --> 00:38:18,926
Realize that
and you'll get over it.

609
00:38:18,994 --> 00:38:22,725
I want to be honest
with you, darling.

610
00:38:22,798 --> 00:38:25,460
I want more.

611
00:38:25,534 --> 00:38:28,833
Everything.

612
00:38:28,904 --> 00:38:30,838
Maybe too much.

613
00:38:30,906 --> 00:38:33,500
Don't think I want any less.

614
00:38:33,575 --> 00:38:37,272
So let's settle something
right now. Do you love me?

615
00:38:39,248 --> 00:38:41,614
I think I do,
but...

00:38:43,685 --> 00:38:45,619
Come here.

618
00:38:45,687 --> 00:38:47,985
I want to kiss you
so badly.

619
00:38:48,056 --> 00:38:52,789
But if you did,
the way things are right now,

620
00:38:52,861 --> 00:38:57,321
I might say something
I wouldn't really mean.

621
00:38:57,399 --> 00:39:01,529
That's why
I want to kiss you.

<i>[Ringing Continues]</i>

00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:09,868
Hello?
Miss Meredith's residence.

625
00:39:10,546 --> 00:39:14,846
- Who, Mr. Loomis?
- She's not in.

626
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:18,819
She isn't in, Mr. Loomis.
No, not even if it's important.

627
00:39:19,888 --> 00:39:21,822
<i>[Annie]</i>
<i>What? A job? </i>

628
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:25,326
l... I have to find out.
It could be something.

629
00:39:28,397 --> 00:39:30,331
Yes, Mr. Loomis?

630
00:39:30,399 --> 00:39:33,800
You look good with
a St. Bernard dog.
The St. Bernard dog?

631
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:35,803
Yes. Uh-huh.

632
00:39:35,871 --> 00:39:38,806
Well, that's you
in the picture, isn't it?

633
00:39:38,874 --> 00:39:41,308
Sprinkling flea powder?

634
00:39:41,376 --> 00:39:43,844
All right, well, I'm here
with David Edwards.

635
00:39:43,912 --> 00:39:45,777
David...
Edwards, yes.

636
00:39:45,848 --> 00:39:48,180
You know,
the prize-winning playwright.

637
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,684
He saw that picture
in a magazine.

638
00:39:50,752 --> 00:39:54,688
He's looking for a girl with
that certain <i>je ne sais quoi</i>
for his new play.

639
00:39:54,756 --> 00:39:58,021
That certain something
you managed to get
with the dog.

640
00:39:58,093 --> 00:40:01,995
It's not a big part, I know...
If this is one of
your jokes, Mr. Loomis...

641
00:40:02,064 --> 00:40:04,999
Jokes? So help me,
I'm only thinking
percentage-wise.

642
00:40:05,067 --> 00:40:07,501
The part calls for
about...
Two and a half.

643
00:40:07,569 --> 00:40:10,003
Two-fifty a week.

644
00:40:10,072 --> 00:40:13,405
I left the script with
my secretary. Can you
pick it up immediately?

645
00:40:13,475 --> 00:40:15,966
Uh, yes.
Yes, Mr. Loomis.

646
00:40:16,044 --> 00:40:17,978
Yes.

647
00:40:18,046 --> 00:40:20,981
He wants me
to pick up a script;
I'm to audition tomorrow.

648
00:40:21,049 --> 00:40:22,983
And you're going
down there?
Of course.

649
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:26,487
Even after what
happened last time?
This has
nothing to do with Loomis.

650
00:40:26,555 --> 00:40:29,991
I'm to audition
for David Edwards.
How do you know that?

651
00:40:30,058 --> 00:40:31,992
I know. I just know.

652
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:35,996
But do you know if he's
gonna be any different
than Loomis?
No, I don't.

653
00:40:36,064 --> 00:40:40,524
I don't want you to go.
Don't you realize what
this could mean to me?

654
00:40:40,602 --> 00:40:44,038
I'm not asking you
not to go down there,
I'm <i>telling</i> you.

655
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:47,542
What makes you think
you have that right?
Because I love you.

656
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:50,544
Isn't that enough?
No, Steve, I'm sorry.
Good night.

657
00:40:52,014 --> 00:40:54,812
Lora, wait.

658
00:40:54,883 --> 00:40:58,319
I didn't mean
to sound dictatorial or
to try to run your life,

659
00:40:58,387 --> 00:41:01,823
but you have to understand
how I feel.
And what about
the way I feel?

660
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,256
Oh, stop acting.
I'm not acting.

661
00:41:04,326 --> 00:41:07,261
I want to achieve something,
something you'll never
understand.

662
00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:10,821
What you're after isn't real.
At least
I'm after something!

663
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:14,335
Not the snapshot of
a disgusting old man with
a beer can on his belly.

664
00:41:14,403 --> 00:41:17,839
Is that your idea
of achieving something?
Is a beer can "real"?

665
00:41:17,906 --> 00:41:19,840
Going up and down,
up and down.

666
00:41:19,908 --> 00:41:23,344
Well, I'm going up and up
and up, and nobody's
going to pull me down!

667
00:41:23,412 --> 00:41:25,607
Lora, listen, please.

668
00:41:25,681 --> 00:41:29,117
I've been trying to do
something with my pictures.
It's meant everything to me.

669
00:41:29,184 --> 00:41:32,119
Every minute,
for a long time now.
No, it hasn't.

670
00:41:32,187 --> 00:41:35,315
Or you wouldn't
give it up to sell beer.

671
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:39,326
I gave it up for
something much better,
something right now: You.

672
00:41:39,394 --> 00:41:42,830
But you're asking me
to give up something
I've wanted all my life,

673
00:41:42,898 --> 00:41:45,833
ever since I was a child,
and I can't do it!

674
00:41:45,901 --> 00:41:47,835
If you grew up,
you could.

675
00:41:49,237 --> 00:41:51,171
What do you mean?

676
00:41:52,374 --> 00:41:54,308
You're not
a child anymore,

677
00:41:54,376 --> 00:41:57,311
and I might not be around
to pick up the pieces
this time.

678
00:41:57,379 --> 00:41:59,313
Good.

679
00:41:59,381 --> 00:42:02,111
I'd like it that way.
Forever.

680
00:42:17,933 --> 00:42:21,869
Joseph and Mary couldn't
find no place at the inn,

681
00:42:21,937 --> 00:42:25,373
so they had to go to the
stable among the animals.

682
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,374
The animals?
Mm-hmm.

683
00:42:27,442 --> 00:42:30,377
And in the manger
Jesus was born.

684
00:42:30,445 --> 00:42:34,040
<i>And the heavenly hosts</i>
<i>sang, "Hallelujah. "</i>

<i>[Ringing Continues]</i>

688
00:42:48,964 --> 00:42:51,023
Hello?
Hello, Annie.

689
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:54,262
- Oh, hello, Mr. Steve.
- Has she come in yet?

690
00:42:54,336 --> 00:42:56,463
I'm sorry.

691
00:42:56,538 --> 00:42:58,472
I see.

692
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,599
Well, Merry Christmas,
Annie.

693
00:43:00,675 --> 00:43:02,802
Merry Christmas to you,
Mr. Steve.

00:43:02,878 --> 00:43:05,904
Mommy, isn't Steve
coming here tonight?

695
00:43:05,981 --> 00:43:08,916
I think you'd better
go to bed, both of you.

696
00:43:08,984 --> 00:43:11,350
But Annie was
telling us a story.

697
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,355
Oh, all right,
Annie can finish it.
Where were we?

698
00:43:14,423 --> 00:43:16,687
- Jesus was almost borned.
- That's right.

699
00:43:16,758 --> 00:43:21,957
As soon as the holy infant
was born, three wise men saw
a beautiful star in the sky.

700
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:24,965
The star
of Bethlehem...
Was Jesus white or black?

701
00:43:25,033 --> 00:43:27,968
It doesn't matter.
He's the way
you imagine him.

702
00:43:28,036 --> 00:43:30,698
But Annie said
he was a real man.

703
00:43:30,772 --> 00:43:32,706
He's not a pretend man.

704
00:43:32,774 --> 00:43:34,833
He was real.
He <i>is</i> real.

705
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,844
Then what color was he?

706
00:43:36,912 --> 00:43:39,346
He was like me...
White.

707
00:43:43,514 --> 00:43:46,415
Now, the closet door
is over here.

708
00:43:46,483 --> 00:43:49,646
The clothes closet door
is over there.

709
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,655
The door to your bedroom
is over here.

710
00:43:52,723 --> 00:43:56,159
And you trip over
the vacuum cleaner
over there.

711
00:43:58,061 --> 00:44:01,053
All right,
come on, let's have
your offstage line.

712
00:44:07,371 --> 00:44:08,998

00:44:14,511 --> 00:44:17,446
Colonel, what are you
doing in there?

715
00:44:19,683 --> 00:44:22,618
Why, Mr. Obermeyer,
why aren't you in Duluth?

00:44:25,822 --> 00:44:27,756
Oh, Herbert, you too?

717
00:44:27,824 --> 00:44:30,486
<i>No! No, no, </i>
<i>Miss Meredith. </i>

She can do it, David.
I guarantee it.

719
00:44:33,864 --> 00:44:35,855
She's just
a little nervous.
Miss Meredith.

720
00:44:35,933 --> 00:44:38,026
Yes, sir?

721
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:41,764
This scene is supposed to
be played for high comedy,
with delicate reactions,

722
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:43,772
not loud,
goggle-eyed takes.

723

I'm sorry, Mr. Edwards.

But I'm an actress,
and a good one.

725
00:44:51,515 --> 00:44:55,178
But I couldn't play
this part for high comedy.
Nobody could.

726
00:44:55,252 --> 00:44:58,949
<i>Nobody. </i>
I think that's all,
Miss Meredith.

727
00:44:59,022 --> 00:45:01,957
<i>And if you'll forgive me</i>
<i>for saying it, </i>

728
00:45:02,025 --> 00:45:04,960
you're too good a writer
to have such a scene
in your play.

729
00:45:05,028 --> 00:45:07,861
Okay, sister,
this way out.

730
00:45:07,931 --> 00:45:12,425
I might as well confess...
She's not really my client.
Tell her to wait a minute.

731
00:45:16,974 --> 00:45:20,933
Lora!
Lora, wait a minute.

732
00:45:21,011 --> 00:45:23,946
I think we've still
got a chance.
No, I don't...

733
00:45:24,014 --> 00:45:25,948
Miss Meredith.

734
00:45:27,184 --> 00:45:30,415
It's been a long time
since anyone told me off.

735
00:45:30,487 --> 00:45:33,923
Tell me, what would you do
with that scene?

736
00:45:35,792 --> 00:45:38,727
I'd cut it out.
Drop it entirely.

737
00:45:39,796 --> 00:45:42,924
That's not a bad idea.
Let me think.

738
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,834
Yes, but the scene
has a couple of lines

01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:55,419
Ohh, Mama!
Come in.

1035
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:11,335
We're goin' now,
honey.

1036
01:04:11,406 --> 01:04:15,342
If that headache ain't gone
in an hour's time,
you take another aspirin.

1037
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:18,504
You hear?
Yes, Mama.
Have a good time.

1038
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:21,014
Mama.
Yes, baby?

1039
01:04:21,082 --> 01:04:25,178
Tell 'em I'm... I'm sorry
I had to miss the picnic.

1040
01:04:25,253 --> 01:04:27,187
Okay. Okay.

1041
01:04:46,274 --> 01:04:49,710
But by the time I find Steve
the fire'll be just perfect.

1042
01:04:49,777 --> 01:04:52,746
You let them alone.
Maybe they got things
to talk about.

1043
01:04:52,814 --> 01:04:54,748
This is
a fine picnic.

1044
01:04:54,816 --> 01:04:59,753
Sarah Jane announces
she's getting the flu.
Mom and Steve just go off.

1045
01:04:59,821 --> 01:05:04,258
Oh, well, if this is the way
it's gonna be, I might as
well get on with my list.

1046
01:05:04,325 --> 01:05:09,262
I can cross off pink sweater
for Elizabeth and yellow
sweater for Sarah Jane.

1047
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:11,264
Then we skip ahead
to algebra.

1048
01:05:11,332 --> 01:05:15,268
Do you think another year of
that stuff is a good idea?
I sure do.

1049
01:05:15,336 --> 01:05:18,772
It's gonna come in
mighty handy with prices
always goin' up.

1050
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,274
Which brings us
back to boys.

1051
01:05:21,342 --> 01:05:24,277
What do you think
about kissing, Annie?
[Laughs]

1052
01:05:24,345 --> 01:05:28,042
Well, there's kissin'
and <i>kissin'. </i>

1053
01:05:28,116 --> 01:05:31,051
I still take pictures
every chance I get.

1054
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:33,553
Still trying
to get them exhibited.
Stop hedging.

1055
01:05:33,621 --> 01:05:35,555
What is your job,
really?

1056
01:05:35,623 --> 01:05:38,558
I'm Vice President
in Charge of Advertising
for P.C. Beer.

1057
01:05:38,626 --> 01:05:41,561
Don't tell anybody.
Why not?
I think it's wonderful.

1058
01:05:41,629 --> 01:05:46,328
'Cause I'm quitting
just as soon as I can
wind things up.
But why?

1059
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:49,837
You ever get the feeling
that you're tired of
what you're doing,

1060
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,338
that it isn't all
you really wanted?

1061
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:56,343
Did you ever get the urge
not to do what you don't
want to do?

1062
01:05:56,411 --> 01:06:00,347
To let yourself go
and follow the wind
or a star,

1063
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:02,849
maybe even
a dusty old rainbow?

1064
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:04,851
Yes.

1065
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:06,853
Well, that's why
I'm going.

1066
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:08,855
Where to?

1067
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:12,290
I don't know.
Around the world,
I guess, for a start.

1068
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,294
You going alone?

1069
01:06:14,362 --> 01:06:18,924
I'm afraid so, l...
I went through my entire
little black book.

1070
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,935
Well, you shouldn't have
skipped my name.

1071
01:06:23,037 --> 01:06:26,871
l... I don't know why
I said that, Steve,

1072
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:30,377
except that
I haven't been this happy
with anyone for years.

1073
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:35,007
You know I still have you
in my blood, don't you?
Oh, Steve, do you really?

1074
01:06:36,584 --> 01:06:39,018
I never got over you,
Lora.

1075
01:06:39,087 --> 01:06:42,181
No matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't.

1076
01:06:45,093 --> 01:06:48,529
There's a kind of kissin'
that's not careless
and doesn't lead to harm,

1077
01:06:48,596 --> 01:06:51,531
when the two people kissin'
are nice and right.

1078
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:53,533
Kissin' is part of
fallin' in love.

1079
01:06:53,601 --> 01:06:56,035
The Lord
wants his children
to fall in love,

1080
01:06:56,104 --> 01:06:58,538
when they're old enough
and got sense enough.

1081
01:06:58,606 --> 01:07:01,541
Then kissin' is like
yeast is to bread...

1082
01:07:01,609 --> 01:07:05,204
Pardon me, Annie,
but I'm starving.
Can't I please find Steve?

1083
01:07:05,279 --> 01:07:07,213
Don't think
you'll have to.

1084
01:07:07,281 --> 01:07:11,149
Steve! It's time
to cook the steaks!
Even Annie says so!

1085
01:07:11,219 --> 01:07:13,153
[Lora, Susie Giggling]

1086
01:07:13,221 --> 01:07:16,156
Telling them
will be wonderful,
but Loomis, ohh.

1087
01:07:16,224 --> 01:07:20,160
Why tell him at all?
He has a lot of commitments
he'll have to get me out of.

1088
01:07:20,228 --> 01:07:23,493
<i>[Annie]</i>
<i>Susie, will you go see</i>
<i>how Sarah Jane is? </i>

1089
01:07:23,564 --> 01:07:26,328
Tell her
I'll be right up.
Okay.

1090
01:07:27,635 --> 01:07:31,162
Let me help you
with that.
Thank you, honey.

1091
01:07:34,242 --> 01:07:36,767
Hello, Allen?
l...

1092
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:39,779
You've been trying
to call me?

1093
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:42,281
I'm sorry.
We've been out all day.

1094
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:44,841
<i>When? </i>

1095
01:07:44,919 --> 01:07:49,356
Oh. Well, that sounds
simply marvelous, but...

1096
01:07:49,424 --> 01:07:52,359
Uh, no, not for dinner.
I'm having guests.

1097
01:07:53,694 --> 01:07:56,629
Why don't you bring him
for cocktails.

1098
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:59,188
Yes. All right.

1099
01:08:00,935 --> 01:08:04,132
Steve!
Amerigo Felluci!

1100
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:06,673
The Italian
movie director.
<i>Yes. </i>

1101
01:08:06,741 --> 01:08:11,201
Oh, he wants me
for the part of Rena
in <i>No More Laughter. </i>

1102
01:08:11,279 --> 01:08:15,613
<i>His agent is in New York</i>
<i>now to talk to me about it. </i>
I see.

1103
01:08:15,683 --> 01:08:19,119
- That means you'd
have to go to Italy.
- Mmm. Of course.

1104
01:08:20,354 --> 01:08:22,288
Oh.

1105
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:27,490
Well, I'll have to
give a two-week notice
to the play.

1106
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:29,826
Yes.

1107
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:32,058
Well,
don't be so calm.

1108
01:08:32,133 --> 01:08:34,067
They want me
for Rena!

1109
01:08:34,135 --> 01:08:38,572
Well, who is she?
Only the best part
since Scarlett O'Hara.

1110
01:08:42,777 --> 01:08:45,678
Sarah Jane?

1111
01:09:06,033 --> 01:09:08,968
Sarah Jane!
Where have you been?

1112
01:09:09,036 --> 01:09:12,972
I've been looking all over
for you! You're supposed
to be in bed...
Shh!

1113
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:22,048
Uh...

1114
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:24,050
Sit down.

1115
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:27,887
Cross your heart.

1116
01:09:29,423 --> 01:09:32,358
You won't tell my mama?
No, I won't
tell Annie.

1117
01:09:32,426 --> 01:09:34,860
W-Well, what is it?

1118
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:37,730
I've been out.

1119
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:41,199
With my boyfriend.

1120
01:09:41,268 --> 01:09:45,204
Boyfriend?
I didn't know
you had a boyfriend!

1121
01:09:45,272 --> 01:09:48,400
- Where's he from?
- The Village.

1122
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:51,912
Oh. Did you meet him
in school?
<i>School? </i>

1123
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,914
No.

1124
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:57,917
There's an ice cream
parlor in The Village
with a jukebox.

1125
01:09:57,985 --> 01:10:01,148
Yeah?
And he used to
stand outside,

1126
01:10:01,222 --> 01:10:05,488
and every time I'd walk by,
he'd whistle!
No kidding!

1127
01:10:05,559 --> 01:10:09,495
But first I pretended he
wasn't on earth.
Yeah?
[Giggles]

1128
01:10:09,563 --> 01:10:12,498
But finally I had to laugh,
and he followed me.
<music> [Orchestra]

1129
01:10:12,566 --> 01:10:15,000
And we started to talk.

1130
01:10:15,069 --> 01:10:18,402
He's cute.
<i>Really</i> cute.
[Sighs]

1131
01:10:18,472 --> 01:10:20,406
Is he a colored boy?

1132
01:10:20,474 --> 01:10:23,739
Why did you ask that?
Well, I don't know.

1133
01:10:23,811 --> 01:10:26,746
It just slipped out.
It was the first thing
you thought of.

1134
01:10:26,814 --> 01:10:29,749
I told you,
it just slipped out!
Well, he's white.

1135
01:10:29,817 --> 01:10:34,754
And if he ever finds out
about me, I'll kill myself.
But why?

1136
01:10:34,822 --> 01:10:38,553
Because I'm white too.
And if I have to be colored,
then I want to die.

1137
01:10:38,626 --> 01:10:41,595
What are you saying?
I wanna have
a chance in life.

1138
01:10:41,662 --> 01:10:45,257
I don't wanna have to
come through back doors,
feel lower than other people,

1139
01:10:45,332 --> 01:10:48,267
or apologize
for my mother's color.
Don't say that!

1140
01:10:48,335 --> 01:10:51,498
She can't help her color,
but I can.

1141
01:10:51,572 --> 01:10:53,506
And I will.

1142
01:10:53,574 --> 01:10:56,008
But we've always
talked things over.

1143
01:10:56,076 --> 01:10:58,704
You never told me
this before.

1144
01:10:58,779 --> 01:11:00,713
<music> [Continues]

1145
01:11:02,783 --> 01:11:05,718
Because I've never had
a boyfriend before.

1146
01:11:07,288 --> 01:11:10,155
Because he wants to
marry me someday.

1147
01:11:11,659 --> 01:11:14,594
A white boy.
Me.

1148
01:11:14,662 --> 01:11:19,395
But how do you think
he'd feel, or his folks,
with a black in-law?

1149
01:11:19,466 --> 01:11:23,402
What do you think people
would say where we lived
if they knew my mother...

1150
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:27,668
They'd spit at me.
And my children.

1151
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:30,676
Sarah Jane,
you know that's not true!
It is.

1152
01:11:30,744 --> 01:11:33,178
That's why
he mustn't know her.

1153
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:35,681
I don't want anybody
to know her.

1154
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:39,685
What if he comes here?
He doesn't even know
where I live.

1155
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:43,189
I pretend I'm a...
I'm a rich girl
with strict parents.

1156
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:45,885
Well, he's bound
to find out...
How?

1157
01:11:47,194 --> 01:11:50,186
I'm going to be everything
he thinks I am.

1158
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:53,427
I look it, and that's
all that matters.

1159
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,936
And you're not to say
anything either.
I won't. You know I won't.

1160
01:11:57,004 --> 01:11:58,938
I never did, but...

1161
01:11:59,006 --> 01:12:02,601
Sarah Jane,
if Mama ever found out
she'd never stand for it.

1162
01:12:02,676 --> 01:12:04,610
I don't care.

01:12:06,146 --> 01:12:08,580
Your mother
doesn't own me.

I won't be seeing you
before you leave,
so good luck in Italy.

01:12:13,988 --> 01:12:15,922
You make that sound
like good-bye.

1166
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:18,925
Why couldn't
we meet in Italy?
What for?

1167
01:12:18,993 --> 01:12:22,258
You'll have a film.
You won't need me.

1168
01:12:22,329 --> 01:12:24,263
But Steve, wait.

1169
01:12:24,331 --> 01:12:28,563
You tell Susie I'll
be at her graduation.
Good-bye, Lora.

Yes, Miss Lora?

Hawkins?

1177
01:13:04,832 --> 01:13:08,563
<i>Well, the Miller's chauffeur</i>
<i>down the road. </i>
Why do you say that?

1178
01:13:08,636 --> 01:13:12,163
I met him at the station
the other day
and he asked about you.

1179
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:15,174
No.
It's with someone else.

1180
01:13:15,242 --> 01:13:17,176
Oh.

1181
01:13:17,244 --> 01:13:20,680
All right, you run along.
I'll try to manage here.
<i>[Doorbell Rings]</i>

1182
01:13:20,748 --> 01:13:22,682
Oh, there they are.

1183
01:13:33,627 --> 01:13:37,654
Look, honey, why don't you
go over to the party
at the church?

1184
01:13:37,731 --> 01:13:39,665
They bore me.

1185
01:13:39,733 --> 01:13:44,670
You're makin' a big mistake.
You're young. You shouldn't
be sittin' around.

1186
01:13:44,738 --> 01:13:46,672
Miss Lora
feels the same way.

1187
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:51,677
She'll lend you
her car.
Oh, she will?
How nice of her.

1188
01:13:51,745 --> 01:13:54,680
I'd be happy knowin'
you're meetin'
nice young folks.

1189
01:13:54,748 --> 01:13:57,683
Busboys, cooks,
chauffeurs!

1190
01:13:57,751 --> 01:14:00,686
Hmph.
Like Hawkins.

1191
01:14:00,754 --> 01:14:04,190
No, thank you.
I've seen your
"nice young folks."

1192
01:14:05,326 --> 01:14:08,261
I don't wanna fight
with you, honey.

1193
01:14:08,329 --> 01:14:10,194
Not tonight.

1194
01:14:10,264 --> 01:14:12,198
I don't feel too good.

1195
01:14:12,266 --> 01:14:14,700
While I get started
on the anchovies,

1196
01:14:14,768 --> 01:14:17,703
will you take this tray
into Miss Lora
and her friends?

1197
01:14:17,771 --> 01:14:19,705
Why, certainly.

1198
01:14:19,773 --> 01:14:22,708
Anything at all
for Miss Lora
and her friends.

1199
01:14:25,479 --> 01:14:28,915
But signor Romano, why should
she need rehearsals?
<i>Ma scusa, signor. </i>

1200
01:14:28,983 --> 01:14:30,917
You know her work.

1201
01:14:30,985 --> 01:14:33,613
Felluci always insists
on two weeks' rehearsal.

1202
01:14:33,687 --> 01:14:37,350
Pictures are a different
medium than the stage.
She will need rehearsal...

1203
01:14:39,927 --> 01:14:44,091
Fetched y'all a mess
of crawdads, Miss Lora,
for you and yo' friends.

1204
01:14:44,164 --> 01:14:48,157
That's quite a trick,
Sarah Jane.
Where did you learn it?

1205
01:14:48,235 --> 01:14:50,669
Oh, no trick to totin',
Miss Lora.

1206
01:14:50,738 --> 01:14:52,672
I learned it
from my mammy,

1207
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:56,676
and she learned it
from old massa 'fore
she belonged to you.

1208
01:15:00,581 --> 01:15:02,515
Well...
Excuse me.

1209
01:15:07,521 --> 01:15:09,455
Another drink,
Sr. Romano?

1210
01:15:11,325 --> 01:15:14,761
Sarah Jane,
why did you do that?

1211
01:15:14,828 --> 01:15:17,262
What's the matter
with you?

1212
01:15:17,331 --> 01:15:20,596
Annie, did you see
what she did?
I heard her.

1213
01:15:20,668 --> 01:15:24,104
You and my mother
are so anxious for me
to be colored.

1214
01:15:25,172 --> 01:15:28,608
I was going to show you
I could be.

1215
01:15:33,681 --> 01:15:35,979
You weren't being
colored.

1216
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:37,984
You were being
childish.

1217
01:15:38,052 --> 01:15:41,988
I don't understand why
you would want to hurt
your mother or me.

1218
01:15:42,056 --> 01:15:44,991
I told her
she has to be patient.

1219
01:15:45,059 --> 01:15:46,993
Things will work out.
How?

1220
01:15:48,962 --> 01:15:52,329
Miss Lora, you don't know
what it means to be...

1221
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:54,333
different.

1222
01:15:54,401 --> 01:15:59,065
Have I ever treated you
as if you were different?
Has Susie? Has anyone here?

1223
01:16:01,375 --> 01:16:03,343
No.

1224
01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:05,344
You've been wonderful,
but...

1225
01:16:05,412 --> 01:16:08,347
Then don't ever do this
to us again.

1226
01:16:08,415 --> 01:16:10,280
Or to yourself.

1227
01:16:12,019 --> 01:16:14,453
It won't solve anything,
Sarah Jane.

1228
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,774
Mama?

1229
01:16:36,009 --> 01:16:37,943
Oh, please.

1230
01:16:39,346 --> 01:16:41,280
Try to understand.

1231
01:16:42,516 --> 01:16:45,610
l-I didn't mean
to hurt you.

1232
01:16:45,686 --> 01:16:47,620
I love you.

1233
01:16:47,688 --> 01:16:50,282
Oh, I know, baby.

1234
01:16:50,357 --> 01:16:54,487
You're just like
a puppy that's been
cooped up too much.

1235
01:16:55,662 --> 01:16:59,598
That's why I wanted you
to go to the party.

1236
01:17:01,034 --> 01:17:03,468
Oh, Mama.

Yes.

you wanted to take
a job in Jersey.

Couldn't we run away?

I'd do anything

That's not a bad idea.

one thing.

It was her boyfriend.
Boyfriend?

Yes. He found out

01:42:39,471 --> 01:42:41,735
I used to take care of her.

1620
01:42:43,341 --> 01:42:47,607
Well, I guess I'll
be running along.

1621
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:51,115
My plane's leaving
in a little while,
Miss Linda.

1622
01:42:53,351 --> 01:42:56,320
[Whispering]
Good-bye, honey.

1623
01:42:56,388 --> 01:42:59,846
You take good care
of yourself.

1624
01:42:59,925 --> 01:43:02,086
Good-bye.

1625
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:04,094
[Whispers]
Mama.

1626
01:43:09,601 --> 01:43:12,297
Well! Get you.

1627
01:43:12,370 --> 01:43:16,204
[Southern Accent]
So, honey child,
you had a mammy.

1628
01:43:16,274 --> 01:43:18,208
Yes.

1629
01:43:19,444 --> 01:43:21,378
All my life.

1630
01:43:31,451 --> 01:43:33,510
Hello, Steve.

1631
01:43:33,587 --> 01:43:35,521
Hello, Lora.

1632
01:43:37,024 --> 01:43:39,788
Some of my girlfriends
get embarrassed
when their mothers...

1633
01:43:39,860 --> 01:43:42,454
wear shorts or capri pants,
things like that.

1634
01:43:42,529 --> 01:43:45,589
I really don't mind.
[Giggling]
That's very big of you.

1635
01:43:45,666 --> 01:43:49,067
I mixed you a highball,
but you only get one
before lunch.

1636
01:43:49,136 --> 01:43:51,798
Yes, ma'am.
I just had a call
from Loomis.

1637
01:43:51,872 --> 01:43:55,137
Don't say a word.
He's got a new role for you.
No, no.

1638
01:43:55,208 --> 01:43:57,142
<i>Highball? </i>
Yes.

1639
01:43:57,210 --> 01:43:59,576
No, they've flown over a print
of the Italian picture.

1640
01:43:59,646 --> 01:44:03,480
He's arranged
a special showing tonight,
and a party afterwards.

1641
01:44:03,550 --> 01:44:05,745
Darling, I'd like you
to see it too,

1642
01:44:05,819 --> 01:44:08,151
but I'm worried
about Annie.

1643
01:44:08,221 --> 01:44:11,315
Ever since she came
back from Los Angeles,
she's changed.

1644
01:44:11,391 --> 01:44:14,690
Dr. Miller's quite concerned
about her condition.

1645
01:44:14,761 --> 01:44:18,697
I think someone should stay
in the house with her tonight.
Do you mind?

1646
01:44:18,765 --> 01:44:21,825
No, of course not, Mama.
I'll see you tomorrow, Steve?

1647
01:44:21,902 --> 01:44:24,496
Sure.

1648
01:44:24,571 --> 01:44:27,506
What can we do
to help Annie, Steve?

1649
01:44:27,574 --> 01:44:31,101
There's no answer, Lora,
never has been.

1650
01:44:31,178 --> 01:44:33,112
Not for a broken heart.

1651
01:44:33,180 --> 01:44:35,614
Mmm, and I know Mother
didn't understand.

1652
01:44:35,682 --> 01:44:38,048
Oh, it was so embarrassing.
And poor Steve.

1653
01:44:38,118 --> 01:44:41,713
I mean, what could he do?
She just swept over him
like a tidal wave.

1654
01:44:41,788 --> 01:44:45,815
Honey, it's only natural
he'd like to go out
with your mother.

1655
01:44:45,892 --> 01:44:49,555
He always enjoyed her company.
You remember that.

1656
01:44:49,630 --> 01:44:51,598
But it's different now.

1657
01:44:51,665 --> 01:44:53,860
All summer long
it's been Steve and me.

1658
01:44:55,135 --> 01:44:58,730
- Annie, you know, don't you?
- Know what?

1659
01:44:58,805 --> 01:45:03,674
That I'm in love with Steve.
I've always been in love
with him and always will be.

1660
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:06,406
Sure, Susie,

1661
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,812
but like a little girl.

1662
01:45:08,882 --> 01:45:12,113
<i>No. I don't think</i>
<i>it even started like that. </i>

1663
01:45:12,185 --> 01:45:15,416
In a funny way,
I always knew.

1664
01:45:15,489 --> 01:45:19,425
Every time I thought
I liked a boy, it was because
he reminded me of Steve.

1665
01:45:19,493 --> 01:45:23,020
And then I'd stop
liking him because...

1666
01:45:23,096 --> 01:45:25,189
Because he wasn't Steve.

1667
01:46:41,108 --> 01:46:43,042
[Knocking]

1668
01:46:44,911 --> 01:46:47,539
Susie?
Are you up, darling?

1669
01:46:47,614 --> 01:46:49,673
<i>Yes. </i>

1670
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:53,277
I just had to tell you.
I have the most wonderful news.

1671
01:46:53,353 --> 01:46:56,220
You're going to do
another picture.
No.

1672
01:46:56,289 --> 01:47:00,453
Not a picture,
not a play,
never again.

1673
01:47:00,527 --> 01:47:04,554
Oh, I know you
don't believe me.
I can't blame you.

1674
01:47:04,631 --> 01:47:08,260
Steve didn't either.
He probably won't until
our tenth anniversary.

1675
01:47:09,836 --> 01:47:11,770
A-Anniversary?

1676
01:47:11,838 --> 01:47:15,239
Oh, Steve and I have
always been in love.

1677
01:47:15,308 --> 01:47:19,711
But it seems I've never
had time for anything
but my work.

1678
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:23,807
So I just up and proposed
that we get married.

1679
01:47:25,619 --> 01:47:29,180
<i>Well, Susie, </i>
<i>what's the matter? </i>
<i>Are you all right? </i>

1680
01:47:29,256 --> 01:47:32,919
Yes, I'm fine.
I hope you'll be very happy.

1681
01:47:32,993 --> 01:47:35,826
Oh, we will be,
all of us.

1682
01:47:37,831 --> 01:47:40,493
What is it, darling?
Tell me.

1683
01:47:40,567 --> 01:47:43,001
I'm very tired.
Good night, Mother.

1684
01:47:45,572 --> 01:47:47,506
Good night, dear.

1685
01:47:56,950 --> 01:47:58,884
[Sobs]

1686
01:48:06,226 --> 01:48:10,629
You know, Annie,
last night when I told
Susie the news,

1687
01:48:12,132 --> 01:48:14,464
she was like ice.

1688
01:48:14,534 --> 01:48:18,402
It's strange.
l... I thought she
would be ecstatic.

1689
01:48:20,907 --> 01:48:24,468
She always seemed to...
To adore Steve.

1690
01:48:28,114 --> 01:48:31,515
Something's wrong
with her, Annie.

1691
01:48:31,585 --> 01:48:33,519
Do you know what it is?

1692
01:48:35,355 --> 01:48:40,657
Miss Lora, you've got
to be very careful
the way you handle Susie.

1693
01:48:40,727 --> 01:48:43,662
She's got
a real problem.
Problem?

1694
01:48:43,730 --> 01:48:47,166
Why don't I know about it?
Why didn't she come to me?

1695
01:48:47,234 --> 01:48:49,828
Maybe because
you weren't around.

1696
01:48:51,171 --> 01:48:53,867
You mean, l...

1697
01:48:53,940 --> 01:48:55,874
I haven't been
a good mother.

1698
01:48:55,942 --> 01:48:58,843
I know you meant
to be a good mother,

1699
01:48:58,912 --> 01:49:01,142
the best kind of mother,

1700
01:49:01,214 --> 01:49:05,947
but look, I meant to
be a good one too,
and I failed.

1701
01:49:06,019 --> 01:49:09,386
But you couldn't have been
a better mother to Sarah Jane.

1702
01:49:09,456 --> 01:49:13,722
- Then where's
my little girl?
- But Annie, that's different.

1703
01:49:13,793 --> 01:49:16,125
Hers is
a very real problem.

1704
01:49:16,196 --> 01:49:18,221
What's complicated
Susie's life?

1705
01:49:18,298 --> 01:49:21,631
We made a home for her;
the prettiest clothes;
the best schools.

1706
01:49:21,701 --> 01:49:25,728
- Susie's in love.
- Oh, Annie.

1707
01:49:25,805 --> 01:49:28,740
Is that all?
Why didn't you say so?

1708
01:49:28,808 --> 01:49:31,936
<i>It's not unusual for a girl</i>
<i>Susie's age to be in love. </i>

1709
01:49:32,012 --> 01:49:35,504
It's who she's in love with
that's causing all the trouble.

1710
01:49:35,582 --> 01:49:39,211
Why? Who is it?

1711
01:49:40,287 --> 01:49:42,221
Mr. Steve.

1712
01:49:44,257 --> 01:49:46,748
What?

1713
01:49:46,826 --> 01:49:49,260
That's impossible.

1714
01:49:49,329 --> 01:49:52,093
How did it happen?
Why did he let it happen?

1715
01:49:52,165 --> 01:49:54,429
I don't think he knows.

1716
01:49:54,501 --> 01:49:56,901
Annie, it can't
be serious!

1717
01:49:56,970 --> 01:49:59,996
It is, Miss Lora.
Plenty serious.

1718
01:50:00,073 --> 01:50:03,008
I better have a talk
with Susie right now.

1719
01:50:03,076 --> 01:50:05,169
Wait, wait.
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

1720
01:50:05,245 --> 01:50:08,339
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

1721
01:50:08,415 --> 01:50:10,542
Susie.

1722
01:50:10,617 --> 01:50:12,744
I've just spoken
to Annie.
Have you?

1723
01:50:12,819 --> 01:50:16,152
Now I know why you were
so upset last night.
So Annie told you.

1724
01:50:16,222 --> 01:50:19,714
That's how you usually
find things out about me.
That's not true!

1725
01:50:19,793 --> 01:50:22,660
Let's face it, Mama.
Annie's always been more
like a real mother.

1726
01:50:22,729 --> 01:50:26,187
You never had time for me.
By the way, is this
worded correctly?

1727
01:50:29,502 --> 01:50:32,164
An application
to college?
Uh-huh.

1728
01:50:32,238 --> 01:50:34,729
But you're going
to study in New York.

1729
01:50:34,808 --> 01:50:37,106
Denver...
It's 1,500 miles away.

1730
01:50:37,177 --> 01:50:39,338
1,628, to be exact.
That's quite a distance.

1731
01:50:39,412 --> 01:50:42,609
I don't think
I'll be missed.
Don't be unfair, Susie.

1732
01:50:42,682 --> 01:50:45,515
You know I'd miss you.
I'm sure you'd be too busy
to miss anyone.

1733
01:50:45,585 --> 01:50:47,576
Much too busy.

1734
01:50:47,654 --> 01:50:49,918
You give me credit
for nothing.

1735
01:50:49,990 --> 01:50:52,788
Yes, I'm ambitious,
perhaps too ambitious,

1736
01:50:52,859 --> 01:50:55,350
but it's been for your sake
as well as mine.

1737
01:50:55,428 --> 01:50:58,363
Isn't this house
just a little bit nicer
than a cold-water flat?

1738
01:50:58,431 --> 01:51:00,865
And your new horse.
Aren't you crazy about it?
Yes, but l...

1739
01:51:00,934 --> 01:51:04,131
And that closet of yours...
Has all the dresses fit for
the daughter of a famous star.

1740
01:51:04,204 --> 01:51:06,138
Now, just a moment,
young lady.

1741
01:51:06,206 --> 01:51:09,471
It's only because
of my ambition that you've
had the best of everything.

1742
01:51:09,542 --> 01:51:12,773
That's a solid achievement
that any mother can be proud of.

1743
01:51:12,846 --> 01:51:14,780
How about a mother's love?

1744
01:51:14,848 --> 01:51:18,045
Love? But you've
always had that!

1745
01:51:18,118 --> 01:51:20,814
Yes, by telephone, postcard,
magazine interviews.

1746
01:51:20,887 --> 01:51:24,050
You've given me everything
but yourself.

1747
01:51:24,124 --> 01:51:28,788
No wonder I went to Annie
last night when I told her
about Steve.

1748
01:51:28,862 --> 01:51:30,796
Oh, Susie.

1749
01:51:33,967 --> 01:51:36,401
If Steve is going
to come between us,

1750
01:51:38,705 --> 01:51:40,900
I'll give him up.

1751
01:51:40,974 --> 01:51:43,135
I'll never see him again.

1752
01:51:43,209 --> 01:51:45,905
Oh, Mama, stop acting!

1753
01:51:45,979 --> 01:51:49,346
Stop trying to shift people
around as if they were pawns
on a stage.

1754
01:51:49,416 --> 01:51:51,850
But, Susie, l...
Don't worry,
I'll get over Steve,

1755
01:51:51,918 --> 01:51:54,352
but please,
don't play the martyr.

1756
01:51:59,025 --> 01:52:03,462
Oh, Mama, I'm sorry.
I didn't want to hurt you.

1757
01:52:03,530 --> 01:52:07,364
But last night
I was so unhappy!
[Sobbing]

1758
01:52:08,935 --> 01:52:10,869
Oh, darling.

1759
01:52:12,505 --> 01:52:15,338
l... I don't know.

1760
01:52:15,408 --> 01:52:18,036
Maybe it was all
to the good because...

1761
01:52:18,111 --> 01:52:22,047
this morning I felt
strangely independent and...

1762
01:52:22,115 --> 01:52:24,549
Well, I like the feeling.

1763
01:52:24,617 --> 01:52:27,609
That's why I think I'd...
I'd like to go away,

1764
01:52:27,687 --> 01:52:29,746
at least for a while.

to understand.

01:52:32,559 --> 01:52:34,493
I'm very sincere

I still can't get over Susie
at the station yesterday.

1770
01:52:57,750 --> 01:53:01,379
She looked so... grown-up
when she said good-bye.

1771
01:53:01,453 --> 01:53:03,387
Yes, she did.

1772
01:53:06,759 --> 01:53:10,195
It does seem awfully
quiet here without her.

1773
01:53:10,262 --> 01:53:12,628
Annie and I were talking
about that last night.

1774
01:53:12,698 --> 01:53:17,101
With both the girls gone,
we felt so alone
in this big house.

1775
01:53:17,169 --> 01:53:19,797
When did this idea
of college come up?

1776
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:22,306
Susie never once
mentioned it to me.

1777
01:53:22,374 --> 01:53:25,366
She decided suddenly.

1778
01:53:25,444 --> 01:53:28,470
And why Colorado?
So far away.

1779

It's what she wanted.

1780

Miss Meredith, it's Annie.
She's terribly sick.

1781
01:53:34,286 --> 01:53:36,880
Did you call
the doctor?
Yes, he'll
be right over.

1782
01:53:36,955 --> 01:53:39,150
And she wants
the minister too.

I'm sorry.

1801

But I didn't mean
to cause her any trouble.
