00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:06,077
Taxi!

160
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,180
You know, maybe I will
have that popcorn.

161
00:07:09,214 --> 00:07:12,250
Look, you've got a nice
little local theater here,

162
00:07:12,283 --> 00:07:14,385
and it's great for what it is,

163
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:17,622
but trust me, you'd never
make it in the big leagues.

164
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:20,091
Bye, now.

165
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:26,698
NANA:
Well, what did she say?

166
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:29,032
I'll be right back.

167
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:30,802
Nah. Mm-mm.

168
00:07:30,835 --> 00:07:33,171
A few laughs,
bunch of quirky ideas.

169
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:36,140
But, anyway, about Thursday...

170
00:07:36,174 --> 00:07:38,142
- (tapping on window)
- Oh, my...

171
00:07:38,176 --> 00:07:39,777
Yeah, hi. It's me again.
(gasps)

Whoa.

174
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,616
- Whoa.
- I'll call you back.

175
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:46,584
Are you out of your mind?

176
00:07:46,618 --> 00:07:47,752
When are you holding auditions?

177
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:49,254
(stammers) Tomorrow.

178
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:50,655
But there is no way you'll...

179
00:07:50,688 --> 00:07:51,789
- Uh, listen, it...
- (horn honks)

180
00:07:51,823 --> 00:07:53,191
Get out of the road, you idiot!

181
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:55,360
Hey, do you mind?
I'm in a meeting here.

182
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:57,161
Could-could you at least
give us a chance

183
00:07:57,195 --> 00:07:58,530
to try out for your boss?

184
00:07:58,563 --> 00:08:01,132
Driver, could you please
lose this maniac?

185
00:08:01,165 --> 00:08:02,333
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on a second.

half what the other acts get?

you're worth, sweetheart.

tell me what I'm worth,

00:21:57,168 --> 00:21:59,671
if you can leave immediately,
single file,

498
00:21:59,704 --> 00:22:01,972
- we'd appreciate that.
- (disappointed sighs)

Jerry, for the love of...

501
00:22:05,443 --> 00:22:07,112
- (whimpers) Sorry, sir.
- Well, where's the next group, Jerry?

502
00:22:07,145 --> 00:22:08,380
- Why am I standing here waiting?

I just... I just, uh...

Be useful or be gone, okay?

505
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,983
Yes. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

506
00:22:13,016 --> 00:22:14,686
Um, okay. Um, you.

507
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:16,987
Hey. Hey. Yeah, you.

508
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,523
Little guy, you're here
for the audition?

509
00:22:18,556 --> 00:22:20,291
Uh, yes.

510
00:22:20,325 --> 00:22:22,060
Yeah, yeah, yes, we are.

511
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:24,027
Guys, we're on right now.

512
00:22:24,062 --> 00:22:25,296
- Now?
- What?

(feedback squeals)

JERRY: Your name?
Hey, your name, please?

515
00:22:29,401 --> 00:22:32,270
Uh, it's Buster Moon
from the New Moon Theater.

516
00:22:32,303 --> 00:22:34,706
And we're very excited to share
our story with you today, sir.

517
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:36,074
Right, guys?

518
00:22:36,107 --> 00:22:38,276
Yeah, great. Now, get to it.

519
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:39,144
Of course. Yes.

520
00:22:39,177 --> 00:22:41,079
Okay, guys,
just like we rehearsed.

521
00:22:42,113 --> 00:22:43,981
(drumbeat intro
to "Let's Go Crazy" playing)

522
00:22:44,014 --> 00:22:45,350
This is the story

523
00:22:45,383 --> 00:22:48,052
of an ordinary high school girl
who discovers...

524
00:22:48,086 --> 00:22:49,487
- (buzzer blares)
- Stop.

525
00:22:49,521 --> 00:22:50,522
Stop?

526
00:22:50,555 --> 00:22:51,556
He wants you to stop.

527
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:52,557
(music stops)

528
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,292
"Ordinary" and "school."

529
00:22:54,325 --> 00:22:56,094
Two words I will never
be associated with.

530
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:58,096
- Never. Never.
- Where the heck did you

531
00:22:58,129 --> 00:22:59,330
dig these guys up from, huh?

532
00:22:59,364 --> 00:23:00,698
If you could all leave
very quickly,

533
00:23:00,732 --> 00:23:02,100
we'd appreciate that, please.

534
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:04,102
I need big shows, Jerry.

535
00:23:04,135 --> 00:23:06,104
- Big ideas!
- Yes, sir, big. The biggest.

536
00:23:06,137 --> 00:23:08,072
Hey, I have a big one.

537
00:23:09,006 --> 00:23:10,974
Okay, honey. Come on, let's go.

538
00:23:11,008 --> 00:23:12,677
You know, the sci-fi musical.

539
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,712
- That's big, right?
- Um, uh...

540
00:23:14,746 --> 00:23:17,115
GUNTER: I mean, it's got
the aliens and the robots

541
00:23:17,148 --> 00:23:19,484
and the lasers
and these amazing songs

542
00:23:19,517 --> 00:23:21,219
from, like, Clay Calloway to...

543
00:23:21,252 --> 00:23:23,688
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Clay Calloway?

544
00:23:23,721 --> 00:23:25,557
(chuckles)
I love Clay Calloway.

545
00:23:26,424 --> 00:23:27,625
I know, right?
(chuckles nervously)

546
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:29,060
I mean, doesn't everybody?

547
00:23:29,093 --> 00:23:30,462
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
See, Jerry?

548
00:23:30,495 --> 00:23:33,198
This is exactly the kind
of big idea I'm talking about.

549
00:23:33,231 --> 00:23:34,766
- Yes, sir.
- So, uh...

550
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,568
so what's the show called?

551
00:23:36,601 --> 00:23:38,770
What's it called? Um...

552
00:23:38,803 --> 00:23:41,072
Gunter, you, uh...
you want to... (splutters)

553
00:23:41,105 --> 00:23:42,407
...uh, tell Mr. Crystal
what it's called?

554
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,477
Uh-huh. It's called
<i>Out of This World.</i>

555
00:23:46,411 --> 00:23:49,514
<i>Out of This World.</i>

556
00:23:49,547 --> 00:23:51,683
That's right. Just imagine it.

557

Ash?

558
00:23:53,384 --> 00:23:56,019
Uh, yeah, I got it.

559
00:23:56,054 --> 00:23:57,789

Not now.

572
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:36,160
Moon, how did you get in here?

573
00:24:36,194 --> 00:24:37,362
Hey, he said not now. Psst.

574
00:24:37,395 --> 00:24:39,197
Yeah, I heard him.
Thanks, Jerry.

575
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,732
Are you telling me you-you got

576
00:24:40,765 --> 00:24:42,767
Clay Calloway's permission
to use his song?

577
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,436
- Well, what if I told you I did?
- Ah.

578
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,437
Okay, so what, you got

579
00:24:46,471 --> 00:24:48,339
some kind of personal connection
to this guy?

- Moon!

Wait, if you know him,

582
00:24:52,343 --> 00:24:56,281
then you could get him
in the show, right?

583
00:24:57,415 --> 00:24:59,384
(chuckles):
Oh, that'd be huge for me.

584
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:00,785
Huge.

585
00:25:00,818 --> 00:25:02,420
Sir, I'm sorry, but seriously?

586
00:25:02,453 --> 00:25:04,856
You think this little guy
from nowhere

587
00:25:04,889 --> 00:25:07,592
can get Clay Calloway
in the show?

588
00:25:09,394 --> 00:25:11,462
Well, Suki,
for your information,

589
00:25:11,496 --> 00:25:15,099
I am not just
a little guy from nowhere.

590
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:16,834
Consider it done, sir.

591
00:25:16,868 --> 00:25:18,570
I'll give you three weeks, Moon.

592
00:25:18,603 --> 00:25:21,239
Three weeks to get this show
up and running, okay?

593
00:25:21,272 --> 00:25:22,840
Yes, sir. Thank you.

594
00:25:22,874 --> 00:25:24,576
Moon, do you really know
Clay Calloway?

595
00:25:24,609 --> 00:25:25,710
Shh, shh. Not now.

596
00:25:25,743 --> 00:25:27,378
- Jerry.
- Oh! Right here, sir.

597
00:25:27,412 --> 00:25:29,614
MR. CRYSTAL: I want these guys
to start work right away.

598
00:25:29,647 --> 00:25:32,317
Set 'em up with our designers,
our dancers, whatever they need.

599
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,385
And get 'em rooms
at the hotel, okay?

600
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:36,721
The very best suites.
The whole shaboodle.

601
00:25:36,754 --> 00:25:37,855
Yes, sir. Yes, of course.

602
00:25:37,889 --> 00:25:39,357
Uh, hey, one last thing.

603
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,492
Don't you ever do nothing
to make me look bad.

604
00:25:41,526 --> 00:25:42,860
You got that?

605
00:25:42,894 --> 00:25:44,495
Oh, I will never
let that happen, sir.

606
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:46,731
You better not,
or I'll throw you off the roof.

607
00:25:46,764 --> 00:25:48,800
(laughs nervously)

608
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,201
Great job, everyone.

609
00:25:50,234 --> 00:25:52,503
Take it away, Raoul.

610
00:25:53,638 --> 00:25:55,607
(Jerry yelps, groans)

611

612
00:25:57,508 --> 00:25:58,276
Oh, my gosh.

613
00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:00,178
- Is this really happening?
- Yeah!

614
00:26:00,211 --> 00:26:02,513
We're playing
Redshore City, baby!

615
00:26:02,547 --> 00:26:05,283
- Yes, we are, Gunter.
- (others whooping)

616
00:26:05,316 --> 00:26:07,151
Gunter, sci-fi musical?

617
00:26:07,185 --> 00:26:08,620
You're a genius.

618
00:26:08,653 --> 00:26:10,521
Yeah, well, Mama always said,

619
00:26:10,555 --> 00:26:13,725
"Gunter, you're not as stupid
as your papa."

620
00:26:13,758 --> 00:26:15,493
No, you're not.

621
00:26:15,526 --> 00:26:16,861
Hey, Suki.

622
00:26:16,894 --> 00:26:18,329
No hard feelings, huh?

623
00:26:18,363 --> 00:26:20,665
You have no idea
what you're getting into.

624
00:26:20,698 --> 00:26:21,899
Whoa.

625
00:26:21,933 --> 00:26:23,401
- Are you out of your mind?
- What?

626
00:26:23,434 --> 00:26:25,570
Clay Calloway?
I'm, like, his biggest fan,

627
00:26:25,603 --> 00:26:27,805
and I can tell you,
the guy is a recluse.

628
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:29,907
Seriously, after his wife died,

629
00:26:29,941 --> 00:26:31,909
no one's seen him
in over 15 years.

630
00:26:31,943 --> 00:26:33,878
Ah. That's not good.

631
00:26:33,911 --> 00:26:35,613
No, it's not.

632
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:37,515
Uh...

633
00:26:37,548 --> 00:26:39,851
Miss Crawly, I need you
to help me find Clay Calloway.

634
00:26:39,884 --> 00:26:41,653
An address,
a phone number, anything.

GUNTER: Okay, so this guy
is coming in from that side,

658
00:27:48,753 --> 00:27:50,488
and it's, like, cuckoo crazy,

659
00:27:50,521 --> 00:27:52,457
and then I think
we should have, like,

660
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:55,293
this cool alien tango scene.

661
00:27:55,326 --> 00:27:59,530
- (vocalizing)
- BUSTER: "Alien tango scene."

00:27:59,564 --> 00:28:00,898
Oh. I love it.

663
00:28:00,932 --> 00:28:02,734
Wait. I've got a better idea.

664
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:06,838
What if it was, like,
a big underwater scene instead?

665
00:28:06,871 --> 00:28:08,372
- Underwater?
- Yeah, yeah.

666
00:28:08,406 --> 00:28:10,274
I'm sure of this. Write it down.

667
00:28:10,308 --> 00:28:11,676
- Mm, okay.
- (gasps) Wait, wait.

668
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:13,945
Stop your clicky-clacky.
I have a better idea.

669
00:28:13,978 --> 00:28:15,847
Uh, you can't keep
changing your mind.

670

Why?

671
00:28:17,082 --> 00:28:18,883
Why? Because in
exactly 20 minutes,

672
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:22,019
the stage crew are coming here
to start work on our show,

673
00:28:22,054 --> 00:28:24,056
and we need to lock
this stuff down.

Ooh, and I want to have, like,
this beautiful love scene...

BUSTER: Miss Crawly,
anything on Calloway?

677
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:33,798
- Hmm, not a thing.
- Oh, geez.

678
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:37,802
Ah, Mr. Moon.

679
00:28:37,835 --> 00:28:39,904
We're your production team,
and we're here to start...

680
00:28:39,937 --> 00:28:42,740
Yes, yes, yes. Uh, you're here
to work on the show.

681
00:28:42,774 --> 00:28:45,042
And I would gladly invite
you all in right now, but...

682
00:28:45,077 --> 00:28:47,345
We should totally do,
like, a battle scene!

683
00:28:47,378 --> 00:28:49,514
Gunter, no, not now.
(chuckles nervously)

684
00:28:49,547 --> 00:28:51,616
I just need a little
more time to, you know,

685
00:28:51,649 --> 00:28:54,452
hammer out a few minor, little
details, so would it be okay

686
00:28:54,485 --> 00:28:56,454
if you all could
come back in, like,

687
00:28:56,487 --> 00:28:58,356
I don't know, an hour?
Or maybe four?

688
00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:00,424
And I really appreciate
your patience.

689

Hmm. Okay.

691
00:29:03,828 --> 00:29:06,397
(sighs): Okay.
That was not a great start.

692
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:09,734

701
00:29:26,951 --> 00:29:28,653
BUSTER:
Good morning.

702
00:29:28,686 --> 00:29:31,689
May I have everyone's
attention, please?

703
00:29:31,722 --> 00:29:33,558
Thank you. Yes.

704
00:29:33,591 --> 00:29:36,427
Okay, um, on behalf
of myself and the cast,

705
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,829
I just want to say that

706
00:29:37,862 --> 00:29:39,964
to be given
this incredible opportunity

707
00:29:39,997 --> 00:29:42,600
to work with you all here
at the Crystal Tower Theater,

708
00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:44,535
well, it's an honor
for all of us.

709
00:29:44,569 --> 00:29:46,838
And I believe that, together,
we can make a show

710
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:48,906
that'll take the audience
out of this world.

711
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,375
(others gasping)

712
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:53,511
And a big thanks
to Steve over here

713
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:55,446
for staying up all night
to make this model.

714
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:56,881
Great work, Steve.

715
00:29:56,914 --> 00:29:58,916
And here she is, folks.

716
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,552
The star of our show, Rosita.

717
00:30:01,586 --> 00:30:03,888
(laughs) That's you, baby!

718
00:30:03,921 --> 00:30:05,489
(gasps) The lead role?

719
00:30:05,523 --> 00:30:07,625
Trust me,
you are perfect for it.

720
00:30:07,658 --> 00:30:09,493
(cheering, excited chatter)

721
00:30:09,527 --> 00:30:11,129
Wait till my kids
hear about this.

722
00:30:11,163 --> 00:30:13,131
And so the story goes like this.

723
00:30:13,165 --> 00:30:15,466
Rosita plays
an astronaut searching

724
00:30:15,499 --> 00:30:17,501
for a missing space explorer.

725
00:30:17,535 --> 00:30:19,470
Together,
with their trusty robot...

726
00:30:19,503 --> 00:30:21,639
- That's me.
- BUSTER: Mm-hmm, yes.

727
00:30:21,672 --> 00:30:23,608
They follow the trail
across four planets.

728
00:30:23,641 --> 00:30:26,111
There's a planet of war,
a planet of love,

729
00:30:26,144 --> 00:30:28,146
a one of despair and one of joy.

730
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:31,515
And each planet will have its
own spectacular musical number

731
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:34,152
- performed by one of our terrific cast.
- (oohing)

732
00:30:34,186 --> 00:30:36,587
A-And how does it end?
Do I find the explorer?

733
00:30:36,621 --> 00:30:39,157
Oh, we have no clue what
we're going to do at the end.

734
00:30:39,191 --> 00:30:40,725
Gunter, no, no, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

735
00:30:40,758 --> 00:30:43,494
We do have great ideas
for the ending.

736
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:44,962
We just... All right.

737
00:30:44,996 --> 00:30:47,099
We've only got three weeks
to make this reality, folks.

738
00:30:47,132 --> 00:30:48,499
Let's get to work.

739
00:30:48,532 --> 00:30:50,568
Johnny, you are gonna play

740
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:53,037
an alien warrior
in a fantastic battle scene.

741
00:30:53,071 --> 00:30:54,872
- Yes!
- Come with me.

742
00:30:54,906 --> 00:30:57,942
("Lite Spots" by Kaytranada
playing, singing in Portuguese)

743
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,649
Johnny, I want you to meet
your fellow dancers.

744
00:31:04,682 --> 00:31:06,817
- Hello, lads.
- Hey, how you doing?

745
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:08,819
Uh, wait. You said
mine was a battle scene.

746
00:31:08,853 --> 00:31:12,090
Well, it is, but Gunter saw it
as more of a... a dance battle.

747
00:31:12,124 --> 00:31:14,059
- Yeah!
- Okay...

748
00:31:14,092 --> 00:31:15,960
Johnny, don't worry.
You're gonna be working with

749
00:31:15,993 --> 00:31:18,196
the number one choreographer
in Redshore City.

750
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,499
JOHNNY:
"Klaus Kickenklober."

751
00:31:21,532 --> 00:31:23,768
Yep. Klaus will turn you
into a pro in no time.

752
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:24,969
- Okay.
- Uh...

753
00:31:25,002 --> 00:31:26,938
Mr. Moon?

754
00:31:26,971 --> 00:31:28,673
Meena, you okay?

755
00:31:28,706 --> 00:31:32,510
Gunter said I'm in
a romantic scene and, uh, uh...

756
00:31:32,543 --> 00:31:34,545
(whispers):
I have to kiss someone.

757
00:31:34,578 --> 00:31:36,214
Yeah.
It's gonna be an amazing,

758
00:31:36,248 --> 00:31:37,949
beautiful, romantic scene.

759
00:31:37,982 --> 00:31:39,717
Mr. Moon, I've never even had

760
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,519
a boyfriend
or any of that stuff.

761
00:31:41,552 --> 00:31:42,787
Ah, don't you worry.

762
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,057
I'm gonna cast
a great partner for you.

763
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,724
- Promise?
- Promise.

764
00:31:46,757 --> 00:31:48,726
Mr. Moon, we're ready
to start building

765
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:50,594
the rest of the sets and...

766
00:31:50,628 --> 00:31:51,963
Okay, okay, okay, listen.

767
00:31:51,996 --> 00:31:53,931
(hushed): I don't exactly know
what they are yet,

768
00:31:53,965 --> 00:31:56,901
so could you give me one more
night to figure this out?

769
00:31:56,934 --> 00:31:59,003
(loudly): Hey, this guy
doesn't have it figured out,

770
00:31:59,036 --> 00:32:00,972
- so we can't start work right now.
- (stammering)

771
00:32:01,005 --> 00:32:02,240
(clears throat) Mason?

772
00:32:02,274 --> 00:32:03,708
- Did everybody hear that?
- Hey, don't...

773
00:32:03,741 --> 00:32:05,177
He does not have the show
figured out.

774
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,944
- (Buster shushing, stammering)
- I'm looking into his eyes,

775
00:32:06,978 --> 00:32:08,980
- and all I see is fear.
- Uh-uh. Mm-mm. (whistles)

776
00:32:09,013 --> 00:32:10,282
Hey, hey, hey, listen, listen...

777
00:32:10,315 --> 00:32:11,816
- And a little bit of shame.
- Yeah, yeah.

778
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:13,851
Look, I-I think
everyone heard you, Mason.

779
00:32:13,884 --> 00:32:14,852
Thank you so much.

780
00:32:14,885 --> 00:32:16,954
Gunter... (clears throat)
we have work to do.

781
00:32:16,988 --> 00:32:19,790
GUNTER: And then I'm thinking,
Ash, you know, she can, like,

782
00:32:19,824 --> 00:32:21,926
totally have a duet
with Clay Calloway,

783
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:24,862
'cause, like, she's a star
that is, like,

784
00:32:24,895 --> 00:32:27,265
guiding them all the way
back home again.

785
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,800
(laughs) Yes, Gunter.
That's perfect for Ash.

786
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:31,103
(doorbell rings)

787
00:32:31,136 --> 00:32:33,604
- (clamoring)
- Mommy!

788
00:32:33,637 --> 00:32:35,806
Oh, my darlings, you're here.

I know, but they couldn't
wait to see you.

- No way.

803

Yes way.

804
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:05,237
Miss Crawly, I'm gonna need you

805
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,804
to go visit him
first thing tomorrow.

806
00:33:06,837 --> 00:33:08,672
- Oh, yes, sir.
- You'll need to rent a car

807
00:33:08,706 --> 00:33:11,042
and take him a letter and, uh,
maybe that fruit basket.

808
00:33:11,076 --> 00:33:12,144
Yes, the fruit basket.

809
00:33:12,177 --> 00:33:13,644

He's not holding.

That was awful.

825

Come on, Johnny.
You can do better.

826
00:33:46,278 --> 00:33:47,878

829
00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:52,950
You're not thrusting, Johnny.

830

- Come on. Thrust.
- Thrust, and thrust.

831
00:33:54,685 --> 00:33:56,720
Still not thrusting.
Can you thrust, please?

Five, six, seven,

I don't see your tippy-toes.

834
00:34:02,394 --> 00:34:04,162
Oh, come on,
he's having a laugh.

835
00:34:04,196 --> 00:34:06,098

Is this, like, a sky-fi show?

952
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,544
Uh, sci-fi? Yes. Yes, it is.

We're gonna rehearse,
Mr. Crystal, so...

958
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,556
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You go

Mr. Moon,
I think Rosita's having, like,

980
00:40:16,668 --> 00:40:19,204
a major freak-out up here.

981
00:40:19,237 --> 00:40:20,205
Oh, no.

982
00:40:20,238 --> 00:40:22,005
Hey, Moon, you really think
the mommy pig's

983
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:23,341
gonna pull this off?

984

Mommy pig?

985
00:40:24,242 --> 00:40:26,077
BUSTER:
Absolutely, sir.

986
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:29,046
Believe me, there's nothing
Rosita can't do.

987
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,149
- I can't do this.
- Why didn't you tell me

988
00:40:31,182 --> 00:40:32,617
- you were afraid of heights?
- I wasn't.

989
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,619
I-I mean, I've never been
afraid in my whole life before,

990
00:40:34,652 --> 00:40:36,788
but I... suddenly, I just...

991
00:40:36,821 --> 00:40:39,090
I don't know
what happened to me.

992

- PORSHA: Hey, you guys.

to first positions, please.

1020

Oh, but now I know
what the dream meant.

00:42:02,807 --> 00:42:05,143
Yeah. She's afraid.

1024
00:42:05,176 --> 00:42:07,245
She'll never be able
to play the part.

1025

But here I am, and I'm young,
and I'm not afraid at all.

Rosita's part. I mean...

Moon, walk with me.

00:42:16,921 --> 00:42:18,790
What's wrong with you, huh?

1029
00:42:18,823 --> 00:42:20,425
What, you got a kink
in your think?

1030
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:22,460
It's just that I wrote
this part for Rosita and...

1031
00:42:22,493 --> 00:42:24,462
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let me tell you something, Moon.

1032
00:42:24,495 --> 00:42:27,899
What you got here is an
opportunity to make me happy.

1033
00:42:27,932 --> 00:42:30,201
And when an opportunity
like that comes along,

1034
00:42:30,234 --> 00:42:31,903

good enough for your show?

No, Mr. Crystal.
Well, I-I think she's wonderful.

Oh, good.
So you'll figure it out.

the French toast, Jerry?

the French toast, Suki.

You okay?

1054

A little shaky, but I'm okay.

1055
00:43:07,305 --> 00:43:09,307
Yeah. You know, uh...

Look, maybe this is
for the best, huh?

I mean, you really were
scared up there.

1058

Right.

1059
00:43:15,346 --> 00:43:16,648
I'll write you another part,
Rosita.

really great part.

- Yes. You're all very sweet,

this is probably for the best.

O... kay.

1258
00:51:16,694 --> 00:51:18,230
BUSTER:
You wanted to see me, sir?

1259
00:51:18,263 --> 00:51:20,265
Yes, I did. Yes, I did.

1260
00:51:20,298 --> 00:51:21,999
- Come on in.
- Whoa.

1261
00:51:22,032 --> 00:51:24,202
- This place is incredible.
- (chuckles)

1262
00:51:24,236 --> 00:51:26,036
Pretty great, huh?

1263
00:51:26,071 --> 00:51:28,206
So, how's it going
with Calloway?

1264
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,040
Calloway?

1265
00:51:30,075 --> 00:51:31,909
It's, uh... it's good.

1266
00:51:31,942 --> 00:51:34,812
- Yeah. Very good.
- Right, right.

1267
00:51:34,845 --> 00:51:36,181
Well, let me ask you something.

1268
00:51:36,214 --> 00:51:38,883
What did I do to make you
disrespect me, huh?

1269
00:51:38,916 --> 00:51:39,683
What?

1270
00:51:39,717 --> 00:51:41,219
Oh, what?
You think I'm an idiot?

1271
00:51:41,253 --> 00:51:42,753
Some kind of bozo?

1272
00:51:42,786 --> 00:51:44,755
No. No, sir, not at all.

1273
00:51:44,788 --> 00:51:48,193
My team, they talked
to Calloway's lawyer,

1274
00:51:48,226 --> 00:51:52,397
and they say he's never
heard of you or your show.

1275
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:54,732
Really? They said that? Uh...

1276
00:51:54,765 --> 00:51:56,734
- You lied to me!
- (gasps) I-I didn't mean to.

1277
00:51:56,767 --> 00:51:58,969
Okay? Honestly, I really
thought I could get him.

1278
00:51:59,003 --> 00:52:01,106
No one makes me look
like a fool! No one!

1279
00:52:01,139 --> 00:52:03,108
- I-I wouldn't dream of doing that to you.
- (growling)

1280
00:52:03,141 --> 00:52:05,310
I swear, if you didn't have
my kid in your show,

1281
00:52:05,343 --> 00:52:07,044
you'd be out
of that window by now!

1282
00:52:07,078 --> 00:52:08,779
Please, please, please.
I-I'm so sorry.

1283
00:52:08,812 --> 00:52:10,415
You'd better have Calloway
by the end of next week,

1284
00:52:10,448 --> 00:52:12,450
- or so help me! (growls)
- I-I-I will.

1285
00:52:12,484 --> 00:52:15,453
I-I-I'll get him.
I won't let you down, sir.

1286
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:19,090
Oh, I know
you won't let me down.

1287
00:52:19,124 --> 00:52:21,459
- Jerry, get in here!
- Yes, sir. Right here, sir.

1288
00:52:21,493 --> 00:52:24,028
- Clean this mess up, will you?
- Yes, absolutely, I'd love to.

1289
00:52:25,096 --> 00:52:26,830
Listen up.
I got to go to Calloway's,

1290
00:52:26,864 --> 00:52:28,400
and I got to go ASAP.

1291
00:52:28,433 --> 00:52:30,202
- Oh, no, please don't go there.
- D-Don't worry. Don't worry.

1292
00:52:30,235 --> 00:52:32,337
I know you said he's crazy,
but I'll be all right.

1293
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:34,439
- Oh, can I go with you, please?
- Uh, I don't know.

1294
00:52:34,472 --> 00:52:35,940
Come on, you're gonna need me.

1295
00:52:35,973 --> 00:52:37,741
I know everything
about this guy.

1296
00:52:37,775 --> 00:52:39,977
- Uh... I think you're right.
- Yes!

1297
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:41,946
Now, listen, Gunter,
you've got to figure out

1298
00:52:41,979 --> 00:52:43,515
the ending of this show
on your own.

1299
00:52:43,548 --> 00:52:45,217
- On my own?
- Yes.

1300
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,485
Miss Crawly, I need you
to take charge while I'm away.

1301
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:49,019
- Yes, sir.
- Now, listen to me.

1302
00:52:49,054 --> 00:52:50,888
You got to bring
your A game here, Miss Crawly.

1303
00:52:50,921 --> 00:52:52,224
I'm serious.
You got to be tough.

1304
00:52:52,257 --> 00:52:54,459
- Yes, I got to be tough.
- You got to be firm.

1305
00:52:54,492 --> 00:52:55,960
Oh, and I got to be firm. Yes.

1306
00:52:55,993 --> 00:52:57,828
And you cannot...
I repeat, cannot...

1307
00:52:57,861 --> 00:52:59,830
let production fall behind,
not one little bit.

1308
00:52:59,863 --> 00:53:00,965
Is that clear?

1309
00:53:00,998 --> 00:53:02,833
Yes, sir, Mr. Moon, sir.

1310
00:53:02,866 --> 00:53:05,070
(military drumbeat playing)

1311
00:53:09,873 --> 00:53:11,243
- Mason!
- (yelps)

1312
00:53:11,276 --> 00:53:13,545
That volcano should've been
finished yesterday!

1313
00:53:13,578 --> 00:53:15,913
- W-We're on it, Miss Crawly.
- You better be!

1314
00:53:15,946 --> 00:53:18,316
Meena, Darius,
take it from the top,

1315
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:21,253
and this time, put a little
juice in it, will you?

1316
00:53:21,286 --> 00:53:23,521
I'm trying my best, Miss Crawly.

1317
00:53:23,555 --> 00:53:25,523
A little juice?

1318
00:53:25,557 --> 00:53:27,925
Hey, everybody.

1319
00:53:30,562 --> 00:53:32,896
You're two hours late
for rehearsal!

1320
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:35,267
Wait. Wait, where's the koala?

1321
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,434
Who are you?

1322
00:53:36,468 --> 00:53:38,002
I'm in charge! That's who!

1323
00:53:38,035 --> 00:53:40,838
Now, get your tail to wardrobe,
sweetheart.

1324
00:53:43,874 --> 00:53:46,043
- (rustling)
- (Buster and Ash groaning)

1325
00:53:49,314 --> 00:53:51,116
(grunts, spits)

1326
00:53:51,149 --> 00:53:52,584
(groans, sighs)

1327
00:53:52,617 --> 00:53:54,286
Oh, my gosh.

1328
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:55,487
There he is.

1329
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,522
That's him.

1330
00:53:57,555 --> 00:54:00,525
BUSTER:
Holy moly, it really is.

1331
00:54:00,558 --> 00:54:03,194
He doesn't look so scary.

1332
00:54:03,228 --> 00:54:05,096
Mr. Calloway!

1333
00:54:05,929 --> 00:54:08,099
- Go away!
- BUSTER: No, please.

1334
00:54:08,133 --> 00:54:10,402
We-we-we just want to talk
to you for one minute.

1335
00:54:10,435 --> 00:54:12,237
That's all.

1336
00:54:13,904 --> 00:54:17,342
We are not leaving
until you talk to us.

1337
00:54:18,476 --> 00:54:20,844
Fine. If you're not
coming over here,

1338
00:54:20,878 --> 00:54:22,980
we're coming over to you.

1339
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:24,848
No! Stay off the fence!

1340
00:54:24,882 --> 00:54:26,284
Don't listen to him.

1341
00:54:31,256 --> 00:54:34,359
("Romeo and Juliet -
Fantasy Overture" playing)

1342
00:54:49,341 --> 00:54:50,841
(whimpers softly)

1343
00:54:53,144 --> 00:54:55,347
(yells)

1344
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,880
(groans)

1345
00:54:57,515 --> 00:55:00,318
(screams, whimpers)

1346
00:55:00,352 --> 00:55:01,619
Stop, stop, stop!

1347
00:55:01,653 --> 00:55:03,555
Porsha, you're still
messing it up.

1348
00:55:03,588 --> 00:55:05,457
(groans) It's not my fault.

1349
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:07,392
He keeps missing the catch.

1350
00:55:07,425 --> 00:55:09,893
I think she's trying to kill me.

1351
00:55:09,927 --> 00:55:11,429
Reset. Let's go again.

1352
00:55:11,463 --> 00:55:13,164
Meena! Darius!

1353
00:55:13,198 --> 00:55:15,400
We're coming to you next,
and I better see

1354
00:55:15,433 --> 00:55:17,669
some chemistry between you two.

1355
00:55:17,702 --> 00:55:20,105
Okay, let's run these steps
one more time.

1356
00:55:20,138 --> 00:55:23,675
- (snapping finger rhythmically)
- So, music starts, I step out,

1357
00:55:23,708 --> 00:55:25,976
do my moves, fancy moves.

1358
00:55:26,009 --> 00:55:27,412
BOTH:
Step together, drop.

1359
00:55:27,445 --> 00:55:32,083
Gazing at each other like
we're burning up with love...

1360
00:55:32,117 --> 00:55:32,916
(groans)

1361
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:35,018
What are you doing
with your face?

1362
00:55:36,521 --> 00:55:38,289
Your face looks broken.

1363
00:55:38,323 --> 00:55:39,657
What is that?

1364
00:55:39,691 --> 00:55:41,126
Uh...

1365
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:43,628
I was falling in love?

1366
00:55:43,661 --> 00:55:45,563
Yeah, Gina, listen.

1367
00:55:45,597 --> 00:55:47,699
I'm sorry, that-that's not what

1368
00:55:47,732 --> 00:55:49,501
falling in love with me
looks like.

1369
00:55:49,534 --> 00:55:51,069
I... I should know.

1370
00:55:51,102 --> 00:55:53,036
I see it day after day,
week after week.

1371
00:55:53,071 --> 00:55:55,038
(chuckles) Let's run it again.

1372
00:55:55,073 --> 00:55:57,609
From the top!
And five, six, seven, eight.

1373
00:55:57,642 --> 00:55:59,411
And one...

1374
00:56:00,712 --> 00:56:02,547
(sighs)

1375
00:56:03,548 --> 00:56:06,418
ALFONSO: Would you like
some ice cream, ma'am?

1376
00:56:06,451 --> 00:56:10,321
Or should I say, Your Majesty?

1377
00:56:11,322 --> 00:56:12,290
Uh...

1378
00:56:12,323 --> 00:56:14,359
I just...
You look like a goddess,

1379
00:56:14,392 --> 00:56:17,195
and, uh...
and-and-and lucky for you,

1380
00:56:17,228 --> 00:56:19,697
it's "free ice cream
for all goddesses" day.

1381
00:56:19,731 --> 00:56:22,534
Aw. (chuckles)

1382
00:56:34,145 --> 00:56:37,282
That's cherry cheesecake,
and I-I make it all myself.

1383
00:56:37,315 --> 00:56:39,317
See, my truck's
right over there.

1384
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:41,319
Come by anytime...

1385
00:56:41,352 --> 00:56:43,288
Your Majesty.

1386
00:56:45,156 --> 00:56:47,991
- (loud bang)
- Ooh, that... Are you okay?

1387
00:56:57,235 --> 00:56:59,170
(sighs)

1388
00:57:00,738 --> 00:57:02,774
ASH (echoing):
Buster?

1389
00:57:02,807 --> 00:57:04,609
(Buster groans)

1390
00:57:04,642 --> 00:57:06,377
You okay?

1391
00:57:07,245 --> 00:57:09,647
Ash? (hisses in pain)

1392
00:57:09,681 --> 00:57:11,483
Where are we?

1393
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:14,252
We're in Clay's house.

1394
00:57:14,285 --> 00:57:15,086
Oh, my gosh.

1395
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,255
- Have you talked to him yet?
- Uh-huh.

1396
00:57:17,288 --> 00:57:19,390
- You have?
- We were just discussing

1397
00:57:19,424 --> 00:57:21,493
whether he'd consider
being in our show.

1398
00:57:21,526 --> 00:57:22,660
What did he say?

1399
00:57:22,694 --> 00:57:24,696
- He said no.
- (Buster gasps)

1400
00:57:24,729 --> 00:57:28,433
Not in a million years.

1401
00:57:29,434 --> 00:57:31,302
Please, Mr. Calloway.

1402
00:57:31,336 --> 00:57:33,505
Look, you don't...
you don't realize how much

1403
00:57:33,538 --> 00:57:36,107
- it would mean to have you in our show and...
- (groans)

1404
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,609
Will you stop your yakking?

1405
00:57:37,642 --> 00:57:39,644
(Clay growls quietly)

1406
00:57:39,677 --> 00:57:41,079
Here.

1407
00:57:41,112 --> 00:57:44,382
Your friend left this
on my property.

1408
00:57:47,352 --> 00:57:49,420
(growls quietly)

1409
00:57:50,455 --> 00:57:53,191
And I want you gone
in the morning.

1410
00:57:54,092 --> 00:57:55,426
(door slams)

1411
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:59,163
And that's why they say,

Okay, porcupine.

We're not talking about my Ruby.

1494

Look, I know she inspired
so many of your songs...

Right.

I... I can't imagine
what it must be like

to lose someone so special,

1499

Ruby would've wanted for you?

I mean, you out here on your own

No, y-you don't understand.

There's... there's no rock star
living here anymore.

Clay, you just need
to play again.

1505
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:48,826
Your songs will bring you back.

1506

You can.
You can reconnect with...

No, I can't!

1508

of my songs in over 15 years.

He will.

1516
01:02:18,123 --> 01:02:19,991
But you should go back.

1517
01:02:20,024 --> 01:02:22,293
Me? What about you?

I just need time with him.

leave him like this.

Oh, oh, yes, yes.

01:11:55,467 --> 01:11:57,302
Ash, in here!

1727
01:11:57,335 --> 01:11:58,503
Buster?

1728
01:11:58,536 --> 01:12:00,372
(Buster whimpering, yelping)

1729
01:12:00,405 --> 01:12:02,307
BUSTER:
I-I'm stuck!

1730
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:03,907
You got to be kidding me.

1731
01:12:03,941 --> 01:12:05,110
ASH:
Hold still.

1732
01:12:05,143 --> 01:12:07,078
What are you doing in there?

1733
01:12:07,112 --> 01:12:08,979
- BUSTER: Ash, the show's off.
- (Ash grunting)

1734
01:12:09,012 --> 01:12:10,181
Crystal got mad

1735
01:12:10,215 --> 01:12:11,516
- and tried to kill me.
- What?

1736
01:12:11,549 --> 01:12:12,983
(grunts)

1737
01:12:13,016 --> 01:12:14,552
(panting):
I thought you were his thugs

1738
01:12:14,586 --> 01:12:16,087
coming here to finish me off.

1739
01:12:16,121 --> 01:12:17,389
- (doorbell rings)
- (whimpers)

1740
01:12:17,422 --> 01:12:20,392
- BUSTER: Oh, no. It's them.
- (knocking)

1741
01:12:20,425 --> 01:12:22,193
Shh. Pretend we're not here.

1742
01:12:22,227 --> 01:12:23,994
(Clay groans)

1743
01:12:24,027 --> 01:12:26,164
The first time I leave home
in 15 years,

1744
01:12:26,197 --> 01:12:27,565
- and what do I find?
- (Buster shushing)

1745
01:12:27,599 --> 01:12:30,168
The show is off, and this guy
is hiding in a suitcase.

1746
01:12:30,201 --> 01:12:33,071
No, no, don't...
don't open the door.

1747
01:12:33,104 --> 01:12:34,972
No, no, no.
(shushes, mutters frantically)

1748
01:12:37,609 --> 01:12:39,144
(all gasp)

1749
01:12:39,177 --> 01:12:41,312
ALL:
Clay Calloway.

1750
01:12:41,346 --> 01:12:42,680
(Clay groans)

1751
01:12:42,714 --> 01:12:44,315
I remember you.

1752
01:12:44,349 --> 01:12:46,151
- (whimpers)
- (thuds)

1753
01:12:46,184 --> 01:12:47,685
BUSTER (echoing):
Miss Crawly.

1754
01:12:47,719 --> 01:12:50,388
- Pew, pew. Pew.
- Miss Crawly, wake up.

1755
01:12:50,422 --> 01:12:51,955
Wha... Mm, what?

1756
01:12:51,989 --> 01:12:53,658
Wake up.
We got to get out of here.

1757
01:12:53,691 --> 01:12:54,958
Coast is clear. Let's go.

1758
01:12:54,992 --> 01:12:56,127
Come on, Miss Crawly. Come on.

1759
01:12:56,161 --> 01:12:57,495
- Come on. Come on.
- (groaning)

1760
01:12:57,529 --> 01:12:59,597
We'll all feel better
when we're safe at home.

1761
01:12:59,631 --> 01:13:01,166
CLAY:
You sure about that?

1762
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:04,702
'Cause I can tell you,
running and hiding away

1763
01:13:04,736 --> 01:13:07,472
is not all
that it's cracked up to be.

1764
01:13:07,505 --> 01:13:10,642
Well, we don't have a choice.

1765
01:13:10,675 --> 01:13:13,578
Yeah, well, all these years,

1766
01:13:13,611 --> 01:13:16,181
I thought the same,
but turns out

1767
01:13:16,214 --> 01:13:18,149
there's always a choice.

1768
01:13:18,183 --> 01:13:21,619
Just never had the guts
to make the right one.

1769
01:13:21,653 --> 01:13:24,055
Know what I mean?

1770
01:13:24,088 --> 01:13:25,723
MR. CRYSTAL (over TV):
Right? A victim.

1771
01:13:25,757 --> 01:13:27,358
- (Linda groans)
- I shut down my show

1772
01:13:27,392 --> 01:13:30,428
'cause of a talentless
little twerp called Buster Moon.

1773
01:13:30,462 --> 01:13:33,598
Seriously, you should've seen
this teeny, tiny loser.

1774
01:13:33,631 --> 01:13:35,733
Oh, and his pathetic
amateur friends...

1775
01:13:35,767 --> 01:13:37,402
let's just say,
whatever Podunk town

1776
01:13:37,435 --> 01:13:39,370
they crawled out of,
that's where they belong,

1777
01:13:39,404 --> 01:13:42,973
'cause it sure ain't
this great city.

1778
01:13:47,245 --> 01:13:48,713
No.

1779
01:13:48,746 --> 01:13:50,482
I see, Clay's right.

1780
01:13:50,515 --> 01:13:53,718
What we're trying to do here,
it takes guts.

1781
01:13:53,751 --> 01:13:55,487
(stammering)

1782
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,754
Guys, wait.

1783
01:13:56,788 --> 01:13:58,756
We-we cannot let
that-that-that-that...

1784
01:13:58,790 --> 01:14:01,092
that bully steal
our hopes and dreams.

1785
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:03,761
No, no, no. We are way past
singing and dancing now.

1786
01:14:03,795 --> 01:14:05,463
Look, I-I know
this might sound crazy.

1787
01:14:05,497 --> 01:14:07,632
- If we got the theater back...
- JOHNNY: Oh, come on.

1788
01:14:07,665 --> 01:14:09,167
- Just for one night only.
- Seriously?

1789
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,802
It's not like
we can just sneak in there

1790
01:14:10,835 --> 01:14:13,271
and put the show on
behind Crystal's back.

1791
01:14:14,172 --> 01:14:17,175
That is exactly
what we're gonna do.

1792
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:18,176
Yes!

1793
01:14:18,209 --> 01:14:20,111
- (doorbell rings)
- (all gasp)

1794
01:14:20,778 --> 01:14:22,714
Maybe it's, like, room service?

1795
01:14:22,747 --> 01:14:24,249
(knocking)

1796
01:14:24,282 --> 01:14:26,150
WOLF:
Open up or you're dead, Moon!

1797
01:14:26,184 --> 01:14:28,119
Okay, it's not room service.

1798
01:14:28,152 --> 01:14:30,655
You and your dumb friends
better not be hiding in there.

1799
01:14:30,688 --> 01:14:32,056
What are we gonna do?

1800
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:33,558
Guys, we just
got to be brave now.

1801
01:14:33,591 --> 01:14:35,393
Are you saying
we should fight these thugs?

1802
01:14:35,426 --> 01:14:37,095
No, no.
They'll beat us to a pulp.

1803
01:14:37,128 --> 01:14:38,263
- (banging at door)
- (all gasp)

1804
01:14:38,296 --> 01:14:39,764
We're gonna put this show on

1805
01:14:39,797 --> 01:14:41,366
whether Crystal likes it or not.

1806
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:44,669
But first, we're gonna jump
out that window.

1807
01:14:44,702 --> 01:14:46,137
ALL:
What?

1808
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:48,406
I'm beginning to like this guy.

1809
01:14:48,439 --> 01:14:50,708
(grunting)

1810
01:14:50,742 --> 01:14:52,377
(all screaming)

1811
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:55,179
("Soy Yo" by Bomba Estéreo
playing, singing in Spanish)

1812
01:14:55,213 --> 01:14:58,082
(gasping, yelling)

1813
01:14:58,116 --> 01:14:59,684
Security.
Yeah, we got nine suspects

1814
01:14:59,717 --> 01:15:01,252
loose on the river ride.

1815
01:15:01,286 --> 01:15:04,155
Repeat, nine suspects loose
on the river ride.

1816
01:15:04,188 --> 01:15:06,824
- Hang on, everybody.
- (all whooping)

1817
01:15:06,858 --> 01:15:08,560
Uh, this is pool security.

1818
01:15:08,593 --> 01:15:10,395
I don't see anyone here. Over.

1819
01:15:10,428 --> 01:15:11,596
There!

1820
01:15:11,629 --> 01:15:13,865
They're heading east
through the back lot!

1821
01:15:13,898 --> 01:15:15,333
Go, go, go, go, go.

1822
01:15:15,366 --> 01:15:17,468
Oh, I wish I didn't have...
(gasps)

1823
01:15:17,502 --> 01:15:19,170
such teeny, tiny legs!

1824
01:15:19,203 --> 01:15:21,606

Well?

01:15:37,288 --> 01:15:38,456
Uh, no sign of 'em, sir.

1833
01:15:38,489 --> 01:15:39,857
We think they might
have split town.

No one is supposed

Uh, who are you?

1840
01:15:57,208 --> 01:15:58,876
We're the night cleaners.

1841
01:15:58,910 --> 01:16:00,378
Oh, I see.

1842
01:16:00,411 --> 01:16:02,547
Well, we don't need
any cleaning right now,

1843
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:05,750
but it'd be better
if you didn't leave, so...

1844
01:16:05,783 --> 01:16:08,920
Mm, I don't suppose any of you
can tap-dance, huh?

1845
01:16:08,953 --> 01:16:10,622
- (throat clears)
- Huh.

1846
01:16:10,655 --> 01:16:12,523
Well, let's move it, folks.

It's your role.

1850

Miss Crawly, let's see if we
can get us a new green alien.

01:16:25,670 --> 01:16:26,904
Yes, sir, Mr. Moon, sir.

1856
01:16:37,415 --> 01:16:40,585
Yeah, well, uh, maybe
I overreacted a little before.

1857
01:16:40,618 --> 01:16:43,388
A little? You were, like,
a total drama queen back there.

01:16:43,421 --> 01:16:45,189
Yeah, okay, we're all good now.

Wow, my dad's gonna flip

(scoffs) Uh, no.

None of us are safe.

Mr. Moon, I know someone

Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah.
