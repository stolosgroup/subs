Yeah, but I didn't press

00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:48,796
They're way too fast
for their position.

00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,800
Wagner, we got you at 150.

What the fuck was that?

73
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:33,961
Navicon was completely off.

74
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:35,630
But it was not our fault?

75
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:37,298
Nibra cannot blame us for that,
right?

76
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:39,066
The station's readings
were right.

77
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:40,701
Good.

78
00:06:44,372 --> 00:06:45,405

79
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:50,645
Wait.

80

She's a soldier.

81
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,784
Why would Nibra send a soldier?

82
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:09,263
Welcome to the Rubikon.
Commander Wagner. Dr. Abbot,
glad to have you on board.

83
00:07:09,297 --> 00:07:12,166
What just happened,
Commander Jenson?
Can you explain?

84
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:16,203
The error must have happened
on ground control's end.

85
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:20,074
Navicon somehow lost
the connection to your shuttle
without a notification.

86
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:21,943
Do you know why?

87
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:26,881
Tracy will look into it
immediately.

88
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:28,983
And bring me the report
once you're done.

89
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:34,487
The crew cabins?

90
00:07:35,156 --> 00:07:36,190
Yes. Um...

91
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:38,726
Follow me, please.

92
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,601
I hope you'll be satisfied
with your cabin.

93
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:50,638
It's not much,
but you've got the biggest one
we've got.

94
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:53,307
Oh, no, please...
that's really not necessary.

95
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:55,376
I hope
your dad's okay about that.

96
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,712
Why?
Did he ask about or...

97
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:39,914
To the new crew,

98
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:44,351
may you and the three others
arriving on Friday
have a good time...

99
00:09:44,385 --> 00:09:46,587
and a productive work
experience together.

100
00:09:47,488 --> 00:09:49,690
Hmm...

101
00:09:57,298 --> 00:10:00,468
So I...
I-- I hear you're a chemist?

102
00:10:00,502 --> 00:10:02,970
Yes, but I've read
all of your reports
and uh...

103
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:06,207
Sure, that's all
you need to conduct
complex gene modification.

104
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,010
I am sure you will do great.

105
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:13,013
As long as you
can follow orders.

106
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:15,517
My words exactly.

107
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:19,453
Commander, I heard
about your excellent
navigational skills.

108
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:23,592
Thank you.
And I heard a lot
about you too, Doctor.

109
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,126
Hopefully only good things.

110
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,227
Yeah.

111
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,464
Commander, it's the laser comm.

112
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,604
Please, enjoy the party,
it's still my shift.

113
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:42,743
How about we play one last game?

114
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:45,346
Let's show the new ones
how it's done.

115
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,647
Come on, new ones!

116
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:52,521
Sure.

117
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:53,555
What are the stakes?

118
00:10:53,588 --> 00:10:54,889
Debit-points.

119
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:55,990
Okay.

120
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,603
-Danilo!
-Uh-huh?

121
00:11:08,637 --> 00:11:11,172
Can you give commander Wagner
a piece of cake, please?

122
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:12,806
Thank you.

123
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,011
Sorry, commander,
my son takes this whole...

124
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:19,581
being called off thing
a bit personally.

125
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,517
And what about you?

126
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:25,620
I just want to see
what type of game you play.

127
00:11:25,654 --> 00:11:27,589
Whoo, I got seven.

128
00:11:27,622 --> 00:11:30,057
I'll take one...
No, make it two.

129
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:34,762
Up to your liking?

130
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:38,899
They are probably used
to different standards
in the air-domes, right?

131
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:42,770
Well, if you want
your essential amino acids
and minerals covered,

132
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:45,940
that's all you get, I'm afraid.
Sorry, domer-boy.

133
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:47,374
Hey, what's your problem?

134
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:50,512
Nothing.

135
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:52,379
I just wonder what makes
an executive's son

136
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:54,649
-want to come to a place
like this.
-Danilo!

137
00:11:54,683 --> 00:11:56,217
Do you think I chose
to come here?

138
00:11:57,218 --> 00:11:58,986
To this old piece of junk?

139
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,121
So then, daddy is punishing you?

140
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,957
Why?

141
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,593
Did you misbehave?

142
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:06,727
Is that my piece?

143
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,330
Thank you.

144
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:14,703
Commander Wagner.

145
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:16,770
A word, please.

146
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:23,678
What is that?

147
00:12:23,712 --> 00:12:25,547
It's our new flight route
for tomorrow.

148
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,716
What, why did they change it?

149
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,451
There is a strange fog cluster
in the northern hemisphere.

150
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:34,121
- Nobody knows what it is.
- Over Östgrunden territory.

151
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,190
Wait, Östgrunden?

152
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,292
Yes,
and there have been fatalities.

153
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,362
What? What happened?

154
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:44,164
They can't tell yet.

155
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:45,833
Isn't Östgrunden
where they arrested

156
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,602
those green fighters activists?

157
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:49,738
Were they the victims,
the green fighters?

158
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:52,674
There were a few hundred.

159
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:02,483
But they said they can
circumnavigate you around it,
right?

160
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:04,151
It'll take us half a day longer.

161
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:09,591
Okay. Looks good. So...
tomorrow evening as planned.

162
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:10,659
Okay.

163
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,075
Come on, give me something.

164
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:33,881
You know,
we're not really supposed
to be in here, right?

165
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:38,787
I can't find anything
on the Internet,

166
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,454
there's nothing
on the cameras...

167
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,922
so I thought I'd try this.

168
00:13:42,757 --> 00:13:45,794
So... that's it?

169
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:49,830
This atmosphere analyzing thing
that never worked?

170
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:51,365
I can't even get it to budge.

171
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,969
You could have asked me,
I'm in contact with Nibra.

172
00:13:56,003 --> 00:14:00,207
Right,
as if I believe a single word
a government company says.

173
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,076
Come on, they're not the enemy.

174
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,812
Uh, yes, actually.
Yes, they are.

175
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:06,947
Of course,
not if you work for them.

176
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:12,953
You worry
for your friends, huh?

177
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:25,700
You're good.

178
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:46,887
All systems are online
and ground control
gave their final go.

179
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,888
You guys are ready?

180
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:48,956
Yes we are.

181
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:51,024
And the samples?

182
00:14:52,594 --> 00:14:54,729
-Dad, the samples.
-Mmm?

183
00:14:55,663 --> 00:14:56,698
Oh, yeah, of course.

184
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:03,470
And these mother cultures
will endure the extended
flight time, right?

185
00:15:03,505 --> 00:15:05,939
-Of course.
-Of course, yes.

186
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:07,007
Yeah...

187
00:15:08,877 --> 00:15:10,712
That's our slot. Let's go.

188
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:13,280
Commander Wagner.

189
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:15,784
Jensen!

190
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:15,008
The son is on the way now
with the mother cultures,

191
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:18,580
but I'm pretty sure
they've been manipulated
as well.

192
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:22,316
<i>Well,</i>
<i>there's been a change of plans.</i>

193
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:25,753
<i>The committee decided</i>
<i>that we want to move</i>
<i>on to IKARUS sooner.</i>

194
00:16:25,787 --> 00:16:28,556
Already, when?

195
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,725
<i>Apparently</i>
<i>in the next few days.</i>

196
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:34,662
What? But I haven't been able
to investigate on the algaes
breathing cycle.

197
00:16:34,696 --> 00:16:36,898
<i>Then you have to search faster</i>
<i>to make it on time.</i>

198
00:16:36,931 --> 00:16:39,667
If he finds out,
he might destroy samples.

199
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:41,569
<i>Prepare IKARUS unnoticed then.</i>

200
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:47,742
Look, the station seems
more interwoven with the algae
than anticipated.

201
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,011
It could be
more complicated to just...

202
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,947
<i>Wagner, just prepare IKARUS.</i>

203
00:17:58,211 --> 00:17:59,881
Hope you know
that some of them

204
00:17:59,914 --> 00:18:02,517
were just exposed to high levels
of cosmic radiation.

205
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,218
I got instructed
on them very thoroughly.

206
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:07,622
Oh, good, good.

207
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:10,090
So you are aware
of what might happen

208
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:14,062
when untrained personnel
enters without supervision?

209
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,030
-Don't worry about me.
-Hmm.

210
00:18:21,703 --> 00:18:23,738
Sounds urgent.

211
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:31,178
Have they already landed?

212
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,747
No, they're still in transit.

213
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,618
Rubikon to Vesta 2,
what's your request?

214
00:18:36,651 --> 00:18:39,152
<i>Rubikon!</i>
<i>You can hear us?</i>

215
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:42,056
<i>We-We're running blind here!</i>
<i>We can't get contact.</i>

216
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,925
<i>Neither to ground control</i>
<i>nor to anyone.</i>

217
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,760
<i>Is the station</i>
<i>still transmitting our signal?</i>

218
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:47,427
Jenson, calm down.

219
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,496
I'll contact them
and get back to you at once.

220
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,467
Rubikon to ground control?

221
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:57,005
Ground control, do you read?

222
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,744
Rubikon to Nibra North.

223
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:10,350
Rubikon to Nibvision.

224
00:19:11,586 --> 00:19:12,620
What's going on?

225
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:14,789
We don't know yet.

226
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,458
Where are they?

227
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,260
-Jenson?
<i>-Wagner, yes, tell me.</i>

228
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:22,229
<i>What'd, what did they say?</i>

229
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,899
We can't make contact either.

230
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:27,300
<i>What are you kidding me?</i>
<i>That can't be true.</i>

231
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:31,105
We tried all staging posts
but no one was answering.

232
00:19:31,139 --> 00:19:33,941
Jenson, what about Navicon?
Are you receiving that?

233
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:37,578
<i>It stopped just like yours</i>
<i>in the Vesta 1.</i>

234
00:19:37,612 --> 00:19:40,982
Wait,
so they would have to land
without any ground AI?

235
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:43,084
Wh-- Are they trained for that?

236
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:44,619
I-- I mean,
we weren't trained for that.

237
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:46,087
Don't-- Don't worry, they...

238
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,089
The...
Their course is preprogrammed.

239
00:19:48,122 --> 00:19:49,389
Right, Commander?

240
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:50,792
-Yes.
-Yes.

241
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:52,760
How much time
until they enter orbit?

242
00:19:52,794 --> 00:19:54,194
Fifty four minutes from now.

243
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:57,497
Okay, Jenson, we're on it.

244
00:19:57,532 --> 00:19:59,399
We're gonna find a solution
to get your connection
to ground.

245
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:02,537
- Don't worry, okay?
<i>- Hannah, hurry, please.</i>

246
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,043
Doctor,
send an emergency signal
to all stations.

247
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:11,145
Even other company stations,
I don't care.

248
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:12,412
Gavin, you come with me.

249
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:16,249
Maybe they aren't receiving
our signal.

250
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:17,985
We have to check
the optical unit.

251
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:25,093
- Point seven five bar.
- Check complete.

252
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,478
<i>Dad,</i>
<i>have you reached anyone yet?</i>

253
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:45,580
Negative.

254
00:20:47,515 --> 00:20:48,916
<i>We're about</i>
<i>to enter atmosphere.</i>

255
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,019
Uh, good news are,
you are exactly on course.

256
00:20:52,053 --> 00:20:54,622
<i>Yes, but only if no parameters</i>
<i>change on the way, right?</i>

257
00:20:55,957 --> 00:20:58,126
Hold on there, hold on there.

258
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,193
You'll be fine.

259
00:22:02,557 --> 00:22:04,091
<i>Do you see it, Hannah?</i>

260
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,797
I'm about...
five meters away.

261
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:27,882
How's she doing?

262
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:29,884
Vitals okay.

263
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:32,452
Heartbeat slightly increased,
but that's normal.

264
00:22:49,337 --> 00:22:51,339
Do we get the test signal?

265
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:57,511
Gavin?

266
00:22:57,545 --> 00:23:01,115
<i>We're losing...</i>

267
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:09,090
-Doctor Kry-- Jenson?
<i>-Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!</i>

268
00:23:09,123 --> 00:23:11,192
<i>-To anyone!</i>
-Jenson, what's going on?

269
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:12,425
<i>The capsule is heating up</i>
<i>uncontrollably!</i>

270
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:13,928
<i>We're going to burn up!</i>

271
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:16,297
Gavin, can you hear that?

272
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,633
<i>- The shell is about to break!</i>
<i>- Danilo!</i>

273
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,701
Gavin?

274
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:25,640
<i>Danilo!</i>

275
00:23:25,673 --> 00:23:26,707
-Vesta 2!
- <i>Danilo!</i>

276
00:23:28,576 --> 00:23:30,443
Danilo!
Danilo, what's going on?

277
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:40,955
<i>Gavin? Gavin,</i>
<i>what's going on down there?</i>

278
00:23:40,988 --> 00:23:42,023
<i>Jenson?</i>

279
00:24:21,028 --> 00:24:22,697
Come on, open up!

280
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:29,270
Fuck!

281
00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:44,518
It wasn't our signal.

282
00:24:44,552 --> 00:24:46,120
Down there everything is...

283
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:48,556
Hannah. The-- the crew.

284
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:49,623
I know.

285
00:24:55,963 --> 00:24:57,631
Rubikon to ground control.

286
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,002
Does anybody hear us?

287
00:25:05,573 --> 00:25:06,607
Rubikon to ground.

288
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,144
Anyone?

289
00:26:18,612 --> 00:26:20,915
<i>Jenson?</i>

290
00:26:20,948 --> 00:26:23,484
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!</i>

291
00:26:23,518 --> 00:26:25,186
<i>- To anyone!

296
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,135

<i>Danilo! Danilo,</i>
<i>what's going on?</i>

298
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,944
Sorry, I forgot the door.

299
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:03,592
It's been two days
and I haven't been able
to reach anyone.

300
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:08,129
The lasers can't get through
the fog in either direction.

301
00:27:09,663 --> 00:27:12,466
Could it be the same
as in Östgrunden?

302
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,035
Spreading across the globe
that quickly?

303
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:17,539
No that would take months,
not days.

304
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:23,545
Well, I think we would
have noticed a meteorite
or a volcano.

305
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,053
And what if it was there before?

306
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:36,457
In the atmosphere
and just not visible yet?

307
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,726
You mean the Navicon problem
when we came up here?

308
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:41,729
Nah. I've thought about that
too, but--

309
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:43,565
That's why
I've been trying to understand

310
00:27:43,598 --> 00:27:46,834
this old atmosphere analyzer...
thing.

311
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:48,135
And how's that going?

312
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:50,271
Tsk... Really good.

313
00:27:50,304 --> 00:27:53,274
So far, I only found out that
it works without a connection.

314
00:27:54,141 --> 00:27:56,076
Well. Keep trying.

315
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:08,689
<i>Dr. Krylow?</i>

316
00:28:10,057 --> 00:28:11,158
<i>Can I come in?</i>

317
00:28:16,497 --> 00:28:19,668
I brought you
something to eat.

318
00:28:22,537 --> 00:28:24,939
<i>I know you're hurting but...</i>

319
00:28:24,972 --> 00:28:26,740
<i>We need to talk</i>
<i>about the algae.</i>

320
00:28:28,677 --> 00:28:30,311
<i>Our oxy tanks</i>
<i>won't hold forever.</i>

321
00:28:30,344 --> 00:28:31,378
Go away.

322
00:28:35,517 --> 00:28:40,254
How far developed
is the gas exchange rate?

323
00:28:40,287 --> 00:28:44,792
-Does the breathing symbiosis
work or not?
-Go away!

324
00:28:44,825 --> 00:28:46,628
<i>How long can we stay up here?</i>

325
00:28:48,195 --> 00:28:49,163
<i>Doctor, please!</i>

326
00:28:49,196 --> 00:28:50,699
Go away!

327
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:55,122
Gavin?

328
00:30:57,257 --> 00:30:59,661
Gavin can you come
and take a look at something?

329
00:31:04,298 --> 00:31:05,332
Gavin!

330
00:31:29,156 --> 00:31:32,226
Oh, fuck... Shit, shit shit!

331
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:33,293
Doctor!

332
00:31:35,996 --> 00:31:37,297
Doctor, help me!

333
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,871
It's an emergency!
Doctor, come!

334
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:47,107
Hurry up!

335
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:53,715
Doctor?
Come on!

336
00:31:56,283 --> 00:31:57,951
Shit! How long?

337
00:31:57,985 --> 00:31:59,420
He just entered.

338
00:31:59,453 --> 00:32:00,688
I'm trying to stop
depressurization.

339
00:32:00,722 --> 00:32:02,791
Just a second.

340
00:32:02,824 --> 00:32:07,127
Mhm, it has to empty completely
before we can fill it up again.

341
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:09,129
No, that's, that's too long.

342
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:13,835
What are you doing? No! No! No!

343
00:32:13,868 --> 00:32:15,369
I'm trying to bypass
the locking mechanism.

344
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:17,438
No, no, no, no!
You'll destroy it!

345
00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:21,442
Look, you can kill us.

346
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:22,911
All of us, trust me.

347
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:25,279
Just wait it out.
Please, wait it out.

348
00:32:26,413 --> 00:32:27,448
Come on.

349
00:32:32,821 --> 00:32:33,855
Come on.

350
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:36,156
Idiot!

351
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:41,395
Okay, empty! Now fastest mode!

352
00:32:41,995 --> 00:32:43,030
Ready?

353
00:32:58,412 --> 00:33:01,148
-Okay, it's open.
-No, no, no, no!
The pressure is still too much!

354
00:33:01,181 --> 00:33:02,917
Fuck it! Come on, help me.

355
00:33:09,256 --> 00:33:11,693
Gavin! Gavin?

356
00:33:11,726 --> 00:33:13,628
Hey, can you hear me?

357
00:33:16,363 --> 00:33:18,131
Mouth to mouth, come on.

358
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:19,199
Okay.

359
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:29,878
Five, four, three, two, one.

360
00:33:36,851 --> 00:33:39,119
Five, four, three, two, one.

361
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:45,125
Okay, again.

362
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:54,836
Okay.

363
00:33:55,837 --> 00:33:57,539
Careful.

364
00:34:15,322 --> 00:34:17,559
Okay,
that's not ripped.

365
00:34:17,592 --> 00:34:21,194
Is he... Is he gonna be okay?

366
00:34:22,162 --> 00:34:24,464
Uh, I don't know. Hope so.

367
00:34:28,468 --> 00:34:30,505
Why the hell would he do that?

368
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:33,473
-Hmm?
-Why would he do that?

369
00:34:33,508 --> 00:34:35,309
I don't know.

370
00:34:35,342 --> 00:34:36,978
Frankly, I don't care.

371
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:42,550
What's wrong with you?
He just tried to kill himself
and you don't care?

372
00:34:42,584 --> 00:34:43,618
Excuse me?

373
00:34:45,452 --> 00:34:47,522
You know what? You do it.

374
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:52,927
What?

375
00:34:52,961 --> 00:34:55,128
They didn't teach you that
at spy academy?

376
00:35:01,669 --> 00:35:02,704
Oh, yeah, I know.

377
00:35:04,572 --> 00:35:06,774
Know what?

378
00:35:06,808 --> 00:35:08,876
That your algae system
is much more advanced
than you want to admit?

379
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,713
-Oh, that's a big surprise.
-Oh, you think I'm an idiot?

380
00:35:11,746 --> 00:35:13,648
I'm gonna tell anything
to a Nibra spy? No!

381
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:15,850
It's not spying.

382
00:35:15,883 --> 00:35:17,384
They funded it,
it belongs to them.

383
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:21,923
No, it doesn't!
It doesn't belong to them.

384
00:35:23,758 --> 00:35:24,993
It belongs to me.

385
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,562
It belongs to Danilo.

386
00:35:34,068 --> 00:35:35,903
I'm sorry about your son.

387
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:41,776
Come on, you must be tired.

388
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:44,579
Just go to bed,
I can take care of him.

389
00:36:35,797 --> 00:36:36,831
Gavin?

390
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:40,868
I closed my eyes for one second.

391
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,882
Hey Gavin?

392
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:56,450
Gavin, how-- how do you feel?

393
00:37:10,798 --> 00:37:12,934
- Let me check your ear...
- Get off me!

394
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:14,001
I...

395
00:37:14,035 --> 00:37:15,268
I'm sorry. I-- I--

396
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:18,106
Calm down.

397
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:19,674
Y-You don't understand this.

398
00:37:19,707 --> 00:37:21,776
-You need to lay down.
-This fog is toxic.

399
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:24,212
- Okay?
- Th-These aerosols... They--

400
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:26,047
- Calm down.
- They're all dead.

401
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,816
- Okay.
- They're all dead.

402
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:31,318
Nobody can survive this!
Dimitri... I...

403
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,621
They're all dead.

404
00:37:33,654 --> 00:37:37,390
Look, look... Breathe, breathe.
Deep breath.

405
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:39,493
I can't breathe.

406
00:37:39,527 --> 00:37:40,628
Everyone down there.

407
00:38:12,425 --> 00:38:14,394
Family? Friends?

408
00:38:16,197 --> 00:38:18,498
You have someone down there?

409
00:38:20,535 --> 00:38:22,036
My little sister.

410
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,574
Sorry.

411
00:38:30,578 --> 00:38:31,913
But it doesn't matter.

412
00:38:31,946 --> 00:38:33,981
We'll suffocate up here anyway.

413
00:38:39,754 --> 00:38:41,488
We're safe here.

414
00:38:46,794 --> 00:38:48,395
Okay?

415
00:38:48,428 --> 00:38:50,932
Danilo and I...

416
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:53,668
achieved a working symbiosis
with the algae.

417
00:38:54,569 --> 00:38:56,336
We can survive.

418
00:38:59,207 --> 00:39:00,942
Thank you.

419
00:39:02,243 --> 00:39:03,978
For telling a Nibra spy.

420
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,915
You're welcome.

421
00:39:10,718 --> 00:39:11,752
Where you going?

422
00:39:16,824 --> 00:39:20,127
Wow, you've been busy.

423
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:24,065
Even <i>if</i> the air is toxic,
there are bunkers.

424
00:39:24,098 --> 00:39:26,801
The lasers can't get through
the fog, but...

425
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:28,368
maybe this can.

426
00:39:28,401 --> 00:39:30,605
I'm trying to get it to work.

427
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,140
Is this?

428
00:39:33,174 --> 00:39:36,978
The old ISS radio system,
exactly.

429
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:39,247
That's ancient technology.

430
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,382
I mean,
do you really think anyone
is still using it?

431
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:45,720
I'll find out.

432
00:39:45,753 --> 00:39:47,955
I just need to reactivate
the radio antenna.

433
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,457
Radio antenna?

434
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,327
I-- Well you can't do that
alone.

435
00:39:54,028 --> 00:39:55,062
Yeah, I know.

436
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:57,331
Take a seat.

437
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:08,242
<i>Look for a circuit</i>
<i>in sector... in sector B.</i>

438
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:10,443
<i>Can you see it?</i>

439
00:40:11,746 --> 00:40:13,446
The cables are tangled.

440
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:16,617
Okay, wait.

441
00:40:17,484 --> 00:40:20,420
I got it, affirmative.

442
00:40:20,453 --> 00:40:22,023
<i>Okay, so redirect it.</i>

443
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:27,628
Have you seen all
this useless crap here?

444
00:40:27,662 --> 00:40:32,633
Ya, I've lived on the station
for eight years,
I've seen it all.

445
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:36,137
That's what happens
when it's too expensive
to get rid of old parts.

446
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,205
You just pile them up together.

447
00:40:39,206 --> 00:40:41,474
Your domer-friend was right.

448
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:43,811
This station is a junkyard.

449
00:40:50,751 --> 00:40:54,121
Yeah, tell me about it.

450
00:40:54,155 --> 00:40:59,327
<i>When I was young,</i>
<i>astronauts were like gods.</i>

451
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,398
Well, when you were young,
countries existed, so...

452
00:41:04,432 --> 00:41:06,734
<i>Okay, Doctor, it's attached.</i>

453
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:07,768
Wait.

454
00:41:08,669 --> 00:41:10,371
Very good.
By the way,

455
00:41:10,404 --> 00:41:14,008
you don't have to call me
doctor all the time.

456
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:15,910
<i>My real name is Dimitri.</i>

457
00:41:17,778 --> 00:41:20,381
I think
I'm getting a signal here.

458
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:23,317
<i>Dimitri.</i>

459
00:41:26,287 --> 00:41:28,322
Give me a second,
let me scan it.

460
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:32,693
Got it.

461
00:41:34,028 --> 00:41:35,062
Okay.

462
00:41:42,803 --> 00:41:44,538
Let's give it a try.

463
00:41:50,444 --> 00:41:51,879
Commander Wagner to ground.

464
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:00,021
Can anybody hear me?

465
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:06,394
Please, anyone?

466
00:42:11,932 --> 00:42:12,967
Hello?

467
00:42:15,504 --> 00:42:17,538
Fuck!

468
00:42:23,744 --> 00:42:24,979
Gavin can't be right.

469
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:29,583
She can't be dead.

470
00:42:42,997 --> 00:42:46,400
Open the door! Come on!

471
00:43:06,454 --> 00:43:08,055
Your ears hurt?

472
00:43:08,089 --> 00:43:09,790
I-- I can give you
some painkillers

473
00:43:09,824 --> 00:43:11,225
for the-- for the ears.

474
00:43:11,258 --> 00:43:12,960
-I'm fine. I'm fine.
-You're sure?

475
00:43:16,697 --> 00:43:19,568
So there's no doubt
about what you said?

476
00:43:24,705 --> 00:43:28,609
The chemical structure
of the fog's aerosols
is highly toxic.

477
00:43:29,844 --> 00:43:31,078
It's lethal.

478
00:43:31,112 --> 00:43:32,813
Where do they come from?

479
00:43:33,714 --> 00:43:35,382
I don't know, uh...

480
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:38,419
To me it seems like
some kind of... chain reaction?

481
00:43:38,452 --> 00:43:39,487
From what?

482
00:43:40,454 --> 00:43:42,456
Permafrost gases.

483
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:45,893
We've been warning people
about this for years

484
00:43:45,926 --> 00:43:49,430
And now
they've obviously reacted
with something.

485
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:53,000
Maybe Toxins
from the power plants,
some other pollution,

486
00:43:53,033 --> 00:43:55,537
maybe chemical weapons
from another corporation war.

487
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:59,640
Fact is it's,
it's all over down there.
We fucked it.

488
00:43:59,673 --> 00:44:02,243
Apparently, the economy
was more important
than breathing.

489
00:44:02,276 --> 00:44:04,044
And what about the air-domes?

490
00:44:04,078 --> 00:44:06,714
They are for a very specific
molecular spectrum.

491
00:44:06,747 --> 00:44:09,984
Only a closed system
with oxygen tanks
could shield them from the fog.

492
00:44:10,017 --> 00:44:11,886
But there are bunkers like that.

493
00:44:11,919 --> 00:44:14,388
Evacuation bunkers.
I trained in them.

494
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:16,824
And what will happen
to the people in there? Hm?

495
00:44:16,857 --> 00:44:20,094
Sooner or later,
they'll run out of food,
they'll run out of oxygen.

496
00:44:20,127 --> 00:44:22,564
Same as us.
We're all just living corpses.

497
00:44:22,597 --> 00:44:24,498
-Gavin.
-And I don't like the idea
of a slow death.

498
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:27,101
We can stay here
as long as we need to.

499
00:44:30,204 --> 00:44:32,039
The algae gas exchange works.

500
00:44:39,213 --> 00:44:40,247
No.

501
00:44:40,281 --> 00:44:41,315
Wha?

502
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:42,883
No?

503
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:46,353
Uh-uh, I can't live like this.

504
00:44:46,387 --> 00:44:50,191
Stuck in this-- in this
tiny metal can forever?

505
00:44:50,224 --> 00:44:51,526
Maybe you two can.

506
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:56,130
- I just can't.
-  -Yeah and what is your alternative?

507
00:44:57,865 --> 00:44:59,333
You wanna try it again?

508
00:45:03,404 --> 00:45:07,208
Look... it's your life,
your decision.

509
00:45:07,241 --> 00:45:09,877
I just want you to know
that if you try it again,

510
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:11,812
you will also kill her.

511
00:45:13,914 --> 00:45:15,082
And me.

512
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:18,786
What, why?

513
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:23,157
I didn't tell you this yet,
but the system is designed
for a full crew of six.

514
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:28,128
They produce CO2 and the system
converts it back into oxygen.

515
00:45:31,198 --> 00:45:36,337
The bare minimum
for an efficient gas exchange
is three people.

516
00:45:37,238 --> 00:45:40,575
Gavin, we need your CO2.

517
00:46:20,214 --> 00:46:21,248
Can I join?

518
00:46:25,286 --> 00:46:26,320
Okay.

519
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:38,098
I'm mad at you, you know?

520
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:43,237
For leaving me alone here
with this old grumpy cat.

521
00:46:52,846 --> 00:46:55,282
What? What?

522
00:46:56,551 --> 00:46:58,185
What?
What's so funny?

523
00:46:58,218 --> 00:47:02,557
It's-- It's just that
I-- I worked my ass off.

524
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:05,593
Debit-point for debit-point.

525
00:47:05,627 --> 00:47:09,229
One shitty mission
after another and for what?

526
00:47:10,765 --> 00:47:11,800
For this?

527
00:47:14,736 --> 00:47:18,573
I could have partied more,
like Knopf, or...

528
00:47:19,873 --> 00:47:22,409
taken a day off
every once in a while.

529
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:26,113
Yeah.

530
00:47:28,449 --> 00:47:33,454
I think I really screwed up
this whole life thing.

531
00:47:39,093 --> 00:47:41,128
Same here.

532
00:47:41,161 --> 00:47:43,732
You think
I was not screwing up my life,

533
00:47:43,765 --> 00:47:47,368
by going on protests
and not washing
and cutting out T-shirts and...

534
00:47:47,401 --> 00:47:49,370
I'm really glad I did that now,
aren't I?

535
00:47:49,403 --> 00:47:52,139
Yeah.

536
00:47:52,172 --> 00:47:53,874
There is no planet B.

537
00:47:57,344 --> 00:47:59,179
And Dimitri.

538
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:01,549
Do you think
he was partying in his lab

539
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:04,118
with his working symbiosis?

540
00:48:11,325 --> 00:48:12,761
Can you imagine
if they knew on Earth

541
00:48:12,794 --> 00:48:14,395
that we were the last
three humans?

542
00:48:14,428 --> 00:48:15,929
Oh, my God!

543
00:48:15,963 --> 00:48:17,665
A bunch of losers
and freaks.

544
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:29,209
Me and my friends...

545
00:48:29,243 --> 00:48:34,448
fought so hard for a planet
that doesn't exist anymore.

546
00:48:37,552 --> 00:48:41,088
I have spent so long
believing in something,

547
00:48:41,121 --> 00:48:43,858
and now it doesn't...
mean anything.

548
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,532
So the naïve activist is gone?

549
00:48:51,965 --> 00:48:53,000
Hmm...

550
00:48:54,836 --> 00:48:56,437
He...

551
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:58,405
He was kind of an idiot anyway.

552
00:49:00,407 --> 00:49:01,743
That's too bad.

553
00:49:03,277 --> 00:49:04,612
I liked him.

554
00:49:49,389 --> 00:49:50,424
Dimitri?

555
00:49:55,262 --> 00:49:56,296
What?

556
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,298
Is that normal?

557
00:50:03,538 --> 00:50:06,340
Eh, they never keep
the exact same green color.

558
00:50:07,241 --> 00:50:08,643
How much longer?

559
00:50:08,676 --> 00:50:10,879
I'm dying this time for real.

560
00:50:10,912 --> 00:50:13,480
Two more minutes!

561
00:50:13,515 --> 00:50:16,216
Yeah, but-- but brown?
That's-- that's weird.

562
00:50:17,752 --> 00:50:19,453
It can happen if, uh...

563
00:50:20,922 --> 00:50:23,323
No, don't worry, it's fine.

564
00:50:23,357 --> 00:50:26,995
Oh, fuck...
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

565
00:50:28,328 --> 00:50:30,397
That's it, I'm done.

566
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:32,767
They'll have to wait
for my breath until tomorrow.

567
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,103
Gavin, it wasn't 45 minutes.

568
00:50:36,136 --> 00:50:38,171
Do-Do you even know
how long that is?

569
00:50:38,205 --> 00:50:40,474
No, of course you don't,
'cause it's always Hannah
and me peddling.

570
00:50:40,508 --> 00:50:44,378
Actually, I do know
because every morning
when you cuddle, I peddle.

571
00:50:44,411 --> 00:50:45,980
At least 45 minutes.

572
00:50:46,014 --> 00:50:47,749
Maybe we should check that
on the CCTV.

573
00:50:47,782 --> 00:50:48,883
Maybe we should.

574
00:50:48,917 --> 00:50:50,785
Okay, okay. What do you say?

575
00:50:51,586 --> 00:50:52,620
Movie night?

576
00:50:53,153 --> 00:50:56,123
-Sure.
-What else?

577
00:51:05,767 --> 00:51:08,135
Dimitri?

578
00:51:08,168 --> 00:51:12,574
Uh, yeah,
choose something. I'm uh...
I'll come in a second!

579
00:51:39,033 --> 00:51:41,368
Sorry, guys, sorry.

580
00:51:41,401 --> 00:51:44,204
Oh, you waited for me,
that's nice.

581
00:51:44,237 --> 00:51:45,540
Where have you been?

582
00:51:45,573 --> 00:51:46,874
I just, uh...

583
00:51:46,908 --> 00:51:48,610
What are we watching?

584
00:51:48,643 --> 00:51:51,311
Nothing, if you can't reactivate
the Internet.

585
00:51:51,345 --> 00:51:55,182
Apparently,
we've reached the end
of the internal movie library.

586
00:51:55,215 --> 00:51:56,249
Oh...

587
00:52:04,491 --> 00:52:06,728
I can offer you a drink.

588
00:52:06,761 --> 00:52:08,596
More. More, more!

589
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:10,098
More, more, more!

590
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:11,599
Hannushka, it's enough.

591
00:52:11,633 --> 00:52:13,635
You had enough, Hannushka.

592
00:52:13,668 --> 00:52:15,803
Yeah, thank you...
Daddy.

593
00:52:15,837 --> 00:52:20,207
-Okay...
-Of all your algae's functions
this is definitely my favorite.

594
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,211
Yeah, well,
this batch is a bit too strong.
You can see that.

595
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:27,749
If I'd known
you had a whole distillery
in your lab I would have just...

596
00:52:27,782 --> 00:52:31,085
Yeah, you would just report me
to Nibra, wouldn't you,
little spy?

597
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:32,954
Yes, probably.

598
00:52:34,922 --> 00:52:36,124
Wait, what?

599
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:38,059
Wait, you didn't know?

600
00:52:38,092 --> 00:52:42,797
Hannushka was sent by Nibra
to steal my mother cultures.

601
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:44,932
What the fuck it's not--
No, not stealing.

602
00:52:44,966 --> 00:52:46,834
-Not stealing. Just taking away.
-Steal is a harsh word.

603
00:52:46,868 --> 00:52:48,636
Take it away and steal.

604
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:50,138
-No. No. No.
-Wh-- Five weeks

605
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,305
and you're only mentioning
this now?

606
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:54,274
I'm so sorry, my dear.

607
00:52:54,976 --> 00:52:56,077
Take it.

608
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:57,145
Three.

609
00:52:58,378 --> 00:53:01,149
You-- You were hiding
the samples?

610
00:53:01,181 --> 00:53:02,449
I was helping.

611
00:53:04,052 --> 00:53:07,588
A few months ago,
Nibra changed their contract.

612
00:53:07,622 --> 00:53:12,325
Suddenly they wanted the system
to be exclusive
for their air-domes.

613
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:14,227
And... I wouldn't mind.

614
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:17,464
I would have taken the money,
which was a lot of money.

615
00:53:17,497 --> 00:53:19,901
Greedy fuck.

616
00:53:19,934 --> 00:53:22,770
Uh? Yeah,
and not ashamed of it.

617
00:53:22,804 --> 00:53:25,305
But Danilo, no.

618
00:53:25,338 --> 00:53:27,141
He was furious.

619
00:53:27,175 --> 00:53:30,144
He decided to make it
a public domain.

620
00:53:30,178 --> 00:53:34,381
He found some secret,
I don't know, distributor.

621
00:53:34,414 --> 00:53:38,418
Huh, actually sounds
like a good guy.

622
00:53:38,452 --> 00:53:43,457
Extremely annoying,
stubborn, rude.

623
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:45,860
A little bit like you.

624
00:53:47,628 --> 00:53:51,498
Cheeky little do-gooder shit,
huh?

625
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,035
Sorry.

626
00:53:56,738 --> 00:53:59,607
Thank you...
you know.

627
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:03,477
Okay, okay, show me
what you got, boys.

628
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:05,747
Ugh, yeah this is garbage.

629
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,582
-No!
-Now you are gone.

630
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,983
What the f--

631
00:54:09,016 --> 00:54:10,518
-Boom.
-No, Gavin!

632
00:54:10,551 --> 00:54:13,286
- Ooh...
- Fuck off, I-- No, I am--

633
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,923
-Hannushka, Hannushka, stop it.
-No! Okay, I'm... no.

634
00:54:15,957 --> 00:54:21,696
No! And you two
should be so fucking ashamed
cleaning out the poor.

635
00:54:24,966 --> 00:54:26,901
I need to dance or I'll die.

636
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:28,502
Oh, no.

637
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:43,117
Gavin! Dance with the woman.

638
00:54:43,885 --> 00:54:45,385
Come on, dance.

639
00:54:45,418 --> 00:54:48,355
- Come on, lover boy.
- Please, no.

640
00:54:48,388 --> 00:54:51,793
-Please...
-Come... Come on.
Come on!

641
00:54:51,826 --> 00:54:54,461
Move the hips, move the hips.

642
00:54:54,494 --> 00:54:57,732
No! I think-- I think
you should get Dimitri to dance.

643
00:54:58,866 --> 00:55:01,002
- Oh, gotcha!
- Oh, no, no!

644
00:55:01,035 --> 00:55:02,537
-Come on!
-No! No,

645
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:04,205
I'm a scientist,
I'm not a dancer, I'm not--

646
00:55:04,238 --> 00:55:06,007
-Yes you are.
-Yes, doctors can dance,
come on!

647
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,141
You're definitely, definitely
drunk enough to dance.

648
00:55:07,175 --> 00:55:08,441
-Come on.
-Stop it.

649
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:10,278
Come on, Dimitri. Yes.

650
00:55:12,345 --> 00:55:14,282
Come on. Yes.

651
00:56:32,593 --> 00:56:35,428
<i>If anyone else</i>
<i>is out there, please answer.</i>

652
00:56:35,462 --> 00:56:37,331
<i>We are a group of survivors</i>

653
00:56:37,365 --> 00:56:39,767
<i>in a bunker underneath</i>
<i>Nibra headquarters.</i>

654
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,069
<i>If you can hear us,</i>
<i>please respond.</i>

655
00:56:43,137 --> 00:56:44,872
Gavin?

656
00:56:44,906 --> 00:56:47,108
Gavin? Hey, you guys wake up!

657
00:56:49,677 --> 00:56:53,080
Hey Gavin! Gavin, wake up!

658
00:56:53,114 --> 00:56:54,982
Come on,
the laser comm worked again,

659
00:56:55,016 --> 00:56:57,251
I-- I talked to one
of the survivors.

660
00:56:57,285 --> 00:56:58,552
Uh--

661
00:56:58,586 --> 00:57:00,354
Come on! Come!

662
00:57:00,388 --> 00:57:02,256
Dimitri.

663
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:05,259
Hey, they're alive. There's--
There are survivors down there.

664
00:57:05,293 --> 00:57:07,028
Yeah, good, great...

665
00:57:13,701 --> 00:57:16,737
Rubikon to survivors,
can you hear us?

666
00:57:20,007 --> 00:57:22,310
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Commander Wagner?</i>
<i>Is this thing working?</i>

667
00:57:22,343 --> 00:57:24,178
Oh, God.

668
00:57:24,211 --> 00:57:26,213
-Um, yes. Yes, it is.
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>

669
00:57:26,247 --> 00:57:29,016
And we're happy
to hear your voice.

670
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:32,520
<i>Uh...</i>
<i>This is Esther Chen-Kaminski,</i>
<i>I'm our representative.</i>

671
00:57:32,553 --> 00:57:34,355
How many of you are there?

672
00:57:35,589 --> 00:57:37,792
<i>We're almost 300 here.</i>

673
00:57:39,527 --> 00:57:41,562
Was there an attack?

674
00:57:41,595 --> 00:57:42,964
<i>Honestly, we don't know.</i>

675
00:57:42,997 --> 00:57:45,066
<i>The fog came so suddenly</i>

676
00:57:45,099 --> 00:57:50,104
<i>and people started coughing</i>
<i>and dropping, it was...</i>

677
00:57:50,137 --> 00:57:52,506
<i>But the soldiers brought us</i>
<i>into the bunker.</i>

678
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,842
But you are safe, aren't you?

679
00:57:56,177 --> 00:57:57,712
<i>No, it's the oxygen.</i>

680
00:57:59,113 --> 00:58:01,916
<i>We don't have much left.</i>

681
00:58:01,949 --> 00:58:04,819
<i>But I guess Krylow's algae</i>
<i>system is preventing</i>
<i>that for you, right?</i>

682
00:58:07,655 --> 00:58:11,058
How do you know about the algae?

683
00:58:11,092 --> 00:58:14,395
<i>Well, some of us own stock</i>
<i>in this promising project.</i>

684
00:58:14,428 --> 00:58:16,496
So you're CEOs or something?

685
00:58:17,798 --> 00:58:19,700
<i>And their families, yes.</i>

686
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:23,904
Is there a Randall Abbot
amongst you?

687
00:58:26,073 --> 00:58:28,009
<i>I'm sorry, no.</i>

688
00:58:32,279 --> 00:58:35,516
<i>But, so these algae...</i>

689
00:58:35,549 --> 00:58:37,218
<i>The system provides for you,</i>
<i>right?</i>

690
00:58:37,251 --> 00:58:39,320
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>Dr. Krylow made that work?</i>

691
00:59:48,055 --> 00:59:49,623
Dimitri?

692
00:59:49,657 --> 00:59:51,425
H-He's in here.

693
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:53,562
Hannah was right.

694
00:59:53,594 --> 00:59:55,729
There are survivors, almost 300.

695
00:59:56,831 --> 00:59:57,898
Really?

696
00:59:57,932 --> 00:59:59,667
Yeah, but even better.

697
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:02,470
There are these openings
in the fog.

698
01:00:02,503 --> 01:00:04,705
Very small ones, but still.

699
01:00:06,807 --> 01:00:09,877
- Hmm.
-  -That's why they could hear us.

700
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:13,481
They've already managed
to transfer their bunker's
coordinates.

701
01:00:13,515 --> 01:00:14,882
The next step
would be the Vesta.

702
01:00:14,915 --> 01:00:17,118
With Gavin's
atmosphere analysis

703
01:00:17,151 --> 01:00:19,186
I might manage
to fly down manually.

704
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:21,789
-To do what?
-Their bunker
provides enough oxygen

705
01:00:21,822 --> 01:00:23,390
for three more weeks at best.

706
01:00:23,424 --> 01:00:25,527
-Mm-hmm.
-If...

707
01:00:27,828 --> 01:00:30,898
If we could bring your algae
down there, we could help them.

708
01:00:33,868 --> 01:00:37,271
-Okay.
-Look, they're supposed to
nourish a closed system.

709
01:00:37,304 --> 01:00:40,174
It doesn't matter
if it's a bunker down there
or the Rubikon up here.

710
01:00:40,207 --> 01:00:45,379
Hold on one second.
So, you're suggesting
we fly down without Navicon?

711
01:00:45,779 --> 01:00:46,814
Yes.

712
01:00:50,217 --> 01:00:54,021
We could save
three hundred lives.

713
01:00:54,054 --> 01:00:55,624
We think
it's a risk worth taking.

714
01:00:55,656 --> 01:00:57,725
Let's say we,
we make it to Earth.

715
01:00:57,758 --> 01:01:00,794
-How do we get to the bunkers?
-They have mobile oxy-tanks.

716
01:01:00,828 --> 01:01:03,764
They could pick us up,
also the equipment
from the Nibra Lab.

717
01:01:03,797 --> 01:01:06,400
It's pretty close
to where we'd land.

718
01:01:06,433 --> 01:01:10,371
Oh, it seems like
you've figured it all out.

719
01:01:10,404 --> 01:01:11,939
Great...

720
01:01:11,972 --> 01:01:14,942
So what if I say no?

721
01:01:17,044 --> 01:01:19,680
What? Wh-Why?

722
01:01:19,713 --> 01:01:24,251
You know,
it's-- it's a little
irresponsible.

723
01:01:24,285 --> 01:01:27,188
And very, very stupid.

724
01:01:27,221 --> 01:01:29,924
Flying down without Navicon?
Are you out of your minds?

725
01:01:29,957 --> 01:01:32,826
So what, we do-- we do nothing?
We just watch them die?

726
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:36,263
-Are you really that selfish?
-Ca-Can you stop with this
green fighter bullshit?

727
01:01:36,297 --> 01:01:38,098
It's not one
of your awareness projects.

728
01:01:38,132 --> 01:01:40,801
We have to help if we can.
We have a moral responsibility.

729
01:01:40,834 --> 01:01:44,471
My only moral responsibility
is to keep you and you alive.

730
01:01:44,506 --> 01:01:46,675
-That's it.
-Isn't this what Danilo
would have wanted?

731
01:01:46,707 --> 01:01:47,676
To help people?

732
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:49,877
Yes, he did.

733
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:50,945
And now he's dead.

734
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:55,983
But I'm here and I say,
"tough luck to them."

735
01:01:57,586 --> 01:02:00,120
I know now how
to make mother cultures.

736
01:02:00,154 --> 01:02:03,057
So, we don't need your help.

737
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:04,526
You're not gonna touch them.

738
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:05,560
-Hey
-You understand
what I'm saying?

739
01:02:05,594 --> 01:02:06,827
You're not gonna <i>touch it!</i>

740
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,862
Stop! Seriously, you guys.

741
01:02:09,964 --> 01:02:11,732
Sit down, both of you.

742
01:02:24,512 --> 01:02:25,879
We have to make a decision.

743
01:02:27,549 --> 01:02:30,017
It really
doesn't make sense.

744
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:31,919
Come on, we are fine.

745
01:02:31,952 --> 01:02:33,454
We are good here.

746
01:02:33,487 --> 01:02:36,190
We, we can stay here
as long as we want.

747
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:39,661
Really? That's your plan?

748
01:02:39,694 --> 01:02:42,664
Have you gone completely crazy
in that lab all this time?

749
01:02:42,697 --> 01:02:45,567
You don't get to talk to me
about crazy, mister.

750
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,702
I am not the one
who tried to kill himself.

751
01:02:47,736 --> 01:02:50,104
How desperately are you
trying to do it again?

752
01:02:50,137 --> 01:02:52,306
Really? You're gonna go there?

753
01:02:52,339 --> 01:02:54,475
Hey, I'm not done
talking to you.

754
01:02:54,509 --> 01:02:56,243
Hey, Hey!
Come back! Come--

755
01:02:56,277 --> 01:02:57,311
Danilo!

756
01:03:11,726 --> 01:03:12,727
You okay?

757
01:03:13,595 --> 01:03:14,696
Nothing, it's...

758
01:03:19,366 --> 01:03:21,736
Hey, hey, hey. You okay?

759
01:03:23,738 --> 01:03:28,075
It's nothing, it's just--
It's just your schnapps,
I guess.

760
01:03:37,985 --> 01:03:40,087
What are you doing?

761
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,823
Just a precaution,
just want to make sure
everything is fine.

762
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:44,659
Thank you.

763
01:03:46,093 --> 01:03:48,162
He's right, you know.

764
01:03:48,195 --> 01:03:50,632
What if those
are the last people
on the planet?

765
01:03:54,034 --> 01:03:55,936
Well.

766
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:59,607
If these are the last people
on the planet Earth,

767
01:03:59,641 --> 01:04:04,411
maybe
it's not that bad of an idea,
to start it all from scratch.

768
01:04:04,445 --> 01:04:07,181
Dimitri, come on.

769
01:04:07,214 --> 01:04:11,952
Okay. Tell me,
what have these people,

770
01:04:11,985 --> 01:04:16,624
these lovely CEOs,
ever done for you?

771
01:04:18,258 --> 01:04:19,893
They got me out of the dirt.

772
01:04:20,427 --> 01:04:22,664
Hm.

773
01:04:22,697 --> 01:04:27,802
Yeah and made you a soldier
to serve them in their army.

774
01:04:27,836 --> 01:04:29,537
You done?

775
01:04:47,921 --> 01:04:49,056
Can't sleep?

776
01:04:55,195 --> 01:04:57,030
Is that her, Knopf?

777
01:04:58,132 --> 01:04:59,734
Her real name is Mia.

778
01:05:01,902 --> 01:05:05,005
This is the last message
I got from her.

779
01:05:05,038 --> 01:05:07,207
I'm trying to find out
where she was.

780
01:05:08,643 --> 01:05:10,845
Okay?

781
01:05:10,879 --> 01:05:14,682
Knopf was stationed
five hours away
from the Nibra central bunker.

782
01:05:14,716 --> 01:05:17,217
There are other bunkers
in that area and...

783
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:19,821
she got an evacuation order too.

784
01:05:21,155 --> 01:05:23,290
That means
she could still be alive?

785
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:27,327
Hannah, why didn't you tell me?

786
01:05:28,195 --> 01:05:31,365
'Cause it's-- it's stupid.

787
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,269
It's such a small chance.

788
01:06:12,707 --> 01:06:14,441
We're preparing for departure.

789
01:06:14,475 --> 01:06:16,977
Will you help us load
the mother cultures?

790
01:06:23,183 --> 01:06:27,254
Dimitri,
either you come with us or...

791
01:06:27,287 --> 01:06:28,422
Or you stay.

792
01:06:37,699 --> 01:06:39,901
What? In here as well? Eh--

793
01:06:39,934 --> 01:06:43,036
No, no, don't say
we're losing them now.

794
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:45,205
Is this a trick,
to make us stay?

795
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:47,107
No, it's not a trick.

796
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:48,610
It's really happening.

797
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:51,278
In the whole station.

798
01:06:52,212 --> 01:06:54,014
Are they sick?

799
01:06:54,047 --> 01:06:55,750
That's what I thought.

800
01:06:55,783 --> 01:06:58,051
So what?
We can't bring them down or?

801
01:06:58,085 --> 01:06:59,119
Dimitri.

802
01:07:01,154 --> 01:07:04,057
-It's you.
-I make them go...

803
01:07:04,091 --> 01:07:06,159
I don't even touch them
without your supervision.

804
01:07:06,193 --> 01:07:08,095
You don't need to touch them.

805
01:07:08,128 --> 01:07:12,600
They feed from our urine
in the station's nutrient cycle.

806
01:07:12,634 --> 01:07:15,937
So they've changed color
because of Hannah's pee?

807
01:07:16,538 --> 01:07:17,872
Exactly.

808
01:07:21,475 --> 01:07:23,711
Yeah, yeah, you almost got me.

809
01:07:24,278 --> 01:07:25,813
Come on.

810
01:07:25,847 --> 01:07:29,851
The algae is extremely sensitive
to hormones.

811
01:07:29,884 --> 01:07:31,886
It's your high levels of HCG
that do it.

812
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,589
No, soldiers can't get pregnant.

813
01:07:34,622 --> 01:07:36,223
We don't even get our periods.

814
01:07:36,256 --> 01:07:38,760
I'm-- I'm sterile
till the end of my duty.

815
01:07:38,793 --> 01:07:43,063
Unless your hormone inducer
loses connection
with its control unit

816
01:07:43,096 --> 01:07:44,632
for a long enough time.

817
01:07:55,142 --> 01:07:57,411
But the algae is fine, right?

818
01:07:57,444 --> 01:07:58,646
We won't lose it?

819
01:07:59,881 --> 01:08:01,415
The algae is fine.

820
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:06,721
That, on the other hand?

821
01:08:06,754 --> 01:08:08,288
If we fly down...

822
01:08:12,694 --> 01:08:16,463
These people need our help.

823
01:08:16,496 --> 01:08:17,532
Come on.

824
01:08:19,801 --> 01:08:22,036
Wait, Hannah, wait.

825
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:23,337
Stop.

826
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:24,471
What the fuck, dude?

827
01:08:24,505 --> 01:08:26,774
He's right, he's right.

828
01:08:27,341 --> 01:08:28,375
Please.

829
01:08:30,044 --> 01:08:31,679
Start loading
the mother cultures.

830
01:08:31,713 --> 01:08:33,113
We're leaving tomorrow.

831
01:08:34,114 --> 01:08:35,382
I'll prepare the Vesta.

832
01:08:35,883 --> 01:08:36,918
Hannah.

833
01:08:39,386 --> 01:08:40,420
Hannah!

834
01:08:57,639 --> 01:09:01,208
Shit. Come on.

835
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:15,255
Again?

836
01:09:15,288 --> 01:09:18,392
In case you didn't notice,
I-- I just killed us.

837
01:09:18,425 --> 01:09:20,561
So, yeah, again.

838
01:09:20,595 --> 01:09:22,864
Yeah, but the other eight times
you made it.

839
01:09:26,701 --> 01:09:28,836
You're just getting tired,
that's all.

840
01:09:31,706 --> 01:09:34,709
This flight corridor
you gave me is fucking narrow.

841
01:09:34,742 --> 01:09:37,477
Well, then they're lucky
that it's you sitting
in the seat.

842
01:09:44,251 --> 01:09:46,821
Hannah, I really think
we should talk about the...

843
01:09:48,056 --> 01:09:49,957
about all this.

844
01:09:49,991 --> 01:09:51,626
What does this mean now?

845
01:09:51,659 --> 01:09:54,028
Nothing, this means nothing.

846
01:09:55,863 --> 01:09:56,898
Hannah...

847
01:09:59,499 --> 01:10:01,703
isn't it likely that--

848
01:10:01,736 --> 01:10:02,804
Stop it, okay? I...

849
01:10:03,838 --> 01:10:05,673
No! Fuck.

850
01:10:07,175 --> 01:10:09,309
I'm going to lose it
at re-entry or landing

851
01:10:09,342 --> 01:10:11,478
or without
the station's radiation shield.

852
01:10:11,512 --> 01:10:13,748
Okay, that's--
that's super fucked up, yeah.

853
01:10:17,417 --> 01:10:19,286
Sorry,
I-- I didn't mean to--

854
01:10:21,488 --> 01:10:25,325
It has no chance anyway,
I mean, even if we stayed.

855
01:10:25,358 --> 01:10:26,961
I can't raise a baby here.

856
01:10:27,929 --> 01:10:30,464
Just you, me and Dimitri?

857
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,168
This changes nothing.

858
01:10:34,202 --> 01:10:36,236
It just makes
the whole situation shittier.

859
01:10:39,807 --> 01:10:40,908
I'm sorry.

860
01:10:42,610 --> 01:10:43,644
I really am.

861
01:10:50,283 --> 01:10:55,223
Look, this one
probably doesn't have a chance.

862
01:10:55,255 --> 01:10:57,357
But, when we're down there...

863
01:10:57,390 --> 01:11:00,027
Are you saying
you want a baby with me?

864
01:11:03,363 --> 01:11:04,397
Why not?

865
01:11:06,601 --> 01:11:07,835
I mean, imagine.

866
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:11,105
It'd kick butt.

867
01:11:11,139 --> 01:11:13,941
My brains, your muscles.

868
01:11:13,975 --> 01:11:15,009
Yeah.

869
01:11:17,078 --> 01:11:18,546
Yeah, you're right, I'm--

870
01:11:18,579 --> 01:11:20,782
I'm definitely too tired
for this.

871
01:11:23,518 --> 01:11:25,953
Eight landings out of ten
must be enough, right?

872
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:21,374
Okay, bring me the last one.

873
01:12:24,679 --> 01:12:27,215
And this is really enough
for 300 people?

874
01:12:29,116 --> 01:12:31,619
Yep, that's the minimum amount.

875
01:12:33,254 --> 01:12:34,789
What?

876
01:12:34,822 --> 01:12:37,091
Again, you think
I'm tricking you or something?

877
01:12:43,363 --> 01:12:46,934
It's just, you've not said
one word of resistance
the whole day.

878
01:12:46,968 --> 01:12:48,703
What... What do you want
from me?

879
01:12:49,904 --> 01:12:51,438
You think I'm stupid enough

880
01:12:51,471 --> 01:12:54,876
to fly down with algae cultures
that don't work?

881
01:12:54,909 --> 01:12:57,845
I mean, I can't stay here
without you two.

882
01:12:57,879 --> 01:13:01,481
So, you won. Congratulations.

883
01:13:02,617 --> 01:13:04,252
What else do you want from me?

884
01:13:13,861 --> 01:13:17,231
Okay, all checks are done.

885
01:13:17,265 --> 01:13:19,300
Are you ready for this?

886
01:13:19,333 --> 01:13:22,370
Nope.

887
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:24,939
Perfect.

888
01:13:24,972 --> 01:13:27,208
<i>Vesta 1,</i>
<i>flight corridor received.</i>

889
01:13:27,241 --> 01:13:31,579
Central Nibra,
contacting you again
in 92 minutes.

890
01:13:31,612 --> 01:13:33,714
<i>Okay, we'll wish you</i>
<i>a safe journey</i>

891
01:13:33,748 --> 01:13:35,983
<i>and we're looking--</i>

892
01:13:36,017 --> 01:13:38,886
And the contact window's
just passed.

893
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,421
Okay, closing the inner door.

894
01:13:49,664 --> 01:13:51,365
Uh... What is that?

895
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,502
The jets are not responding.

896
01:14:00,574 --> 01:14:01,609
Whoa...

897
01:14:06,013 --> 01:14:09,016
What is that?

898
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:12,887
The jet tanks overheated but...
We haven't even ignited.

899
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:15,556
-Overheated?
-The temperature keeps rising,
but...

900
01:14:15,589 --> 01:14:18,125
fuck, that can't be right.

901
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:19,126
Hannah, what?

902
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,561
We have overpressure.

903
01:14:20,594 --> 01:14:22,263
-Oh, shit.
-Makes no sense.

904
01:14:22,296 --> 01:14:24,098
I need to release the tanks.

905
01:14:26,133 --> 01:14:29,036
-Did it work?
-The valves are not opening.

906
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:31,639
-Try the gas outlet!
-I tried!

907
01:14:31,672 --> 01:14:34,342
They must have deformed
under the heat!

908
01:14:34,375 --> 01:14:36,210
How hot are the tanks?

909
01:14:38,045 --> 01:14:39,080
Hannah?

910
01:14:40,414 --> 01:14:41,816
Hannah!

911
01:14:41,849 --> 01:14:45,553
Unfasten immediately!
Get out now!

912
01:14:49,957 --> 01:14:52,827
- Come on!
- Come on, come on.
Come on.

913
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:54,061
Come on,
we're gonna explode!

914
01:14:54,095 --> 01:14:56,130
Put yourself together.

915
01:14:56,163 --> 01:14:58,366
You put yourself together!
Come on!

916
01:15:01,168 --> 01:15:02,203
Go!

917
01:15:07,742 --> 01:15:11,012
-What the fuck?
-What?

918
01:15:11,045 --> 01:15:16,183
Look.
The Vesta's cooling system
shut down almost 11 hours ago.

919
01:15:16,217 --> 01:15:19,687
That's why the tanks overheated.
I'll redirect the solar panels.

920
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:23,057
Shadow alone
won't do it anymore.
Look at the temperature.

921
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:24,425
We need to decouple it.

922
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:26,427
No. No, there has to be
another way.

923
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:29,430
We can dump the tanks manually,
eh?

924
01:15:29,463 --> 01:15:31,332
That could work.

925
01:15:31,365 --> 01:15:34,035
Only from inside the Vesta,
but that's far too dangerous.

926
01:15:34,702 --> 01:15:35,803
Gavin, stop!

927
01:15:35,836 --> 01:15:37,538
It could blow up any second!

928
01:15:37,571 --> 01:15:38,606
Fuck!

929
01:15:48,517 --> 01:15:51,585
He has to go through
the whole cooling block.
That's impossible.

930
01:15:51,619 --> 01:15:53,254
He's killing himself.

931
01:15:53,287 --> 01:15:54,355
All of us.

932
01:15:57,058 --> 01:15:58,426
Can you still decouple?

933
01:16:07,368 --> 01:16:09,770
- No, no, no! No!
- Wait! Hannah!

934
01:16:09,804 --> 01:16:11,205
No! No!

935
01:16:11,238 --> 01:16:12,507
No! No!

936
01:16:13,641 --> 01:16:14,942
Stop!

937
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:16,744
Stop!

938
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:20,915
No!

939
01:16:20,948 --> 01:16:22,149
No!

940
01:16:22,183 --> 01:16:23,284
Hannah, please!

941
01:16:25,086 --> 01:16:26,287
No!

942
01:17:40,861 --> 01:17:41,896
I had to.

943
01:18:35,382 --> 01:18:37,652
You did the right thing,
commander.

944
01:18:39,954 --> 01:18:41,523
He would have died.

945
01:18:45,326 --> 01:18:49,296
I know, doesn't seem
like much up here...

946
01:18:50,632 --> 01:18:52,466
But, uh...

947
01:18:54,636 --> 01:18:56,070
this place saved our lives.

948
01:19:00,841 --> 01:19:02,243
Could be home.

949
01:19:10,117 --> 01:19:11,819
How was it for you?

950
01:19:15,256 --> 01:19:17,024
Having a child?

951
01:19:26,433 --> 01:19:27,569
Loud.

952
01:19:30,904 --> 01:19:32,406
Nerve-wracking.

953
01:19:33,073 --> 01:19:34,743
Exhausting.

954
01:19:36,944 --> 01:19:38,245
Amazing.

955
01:19:43,117 --> 01:19:46,186
You can't possibly imagine
loving anyone

956
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:48,989
like you love
this little creature.

957
01:19:58,265 --> 01:19:59,300
Okay.

958
01:20:30,532 --> 01:20:33,167
We don't need two people
to tell them.

959
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,603
-But I was...
-Go or I go.

960
01:20:44,546 --> 01:20:46,748
Did you do it
because of the pregnancy?

961
01:20:49,249 --> 01:20:52,319
No. I did it because of us.

962
01:20:55,255 --> 01:20:57,559
<i>Vesta 1?</i>

963
01:20:57,592 --> 01:20:59,828
<i>Vesta 1, we can't detect</i>
<i>your signal.</i>

964
01:21:01,362 --> 01:21:02,764
<i>Do you read?</i>

965
01:21:02,797 --> 01:21:03,832
<i>Vesta 1?</i>

966
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:07,134
Yes, Esther we're here.

967
01:21:07,167 --> 01:21:09,103
<i>Gavin, where are you?</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

968
01:21:30,157 --> 01:21:31,526
What's IKARUS?

969
01:21:34,529 --> 01:21:36,163
They said that you would know.

970
01:21:48,877 --> 01:21:51,311
My actual mission.

971
01:21:51,345 --> 01:21:53,648
Once I found
a working mother culture,

972
01:21:53,681 --> 01:21:56,216
I was to bring down
the entire algae lab.

973
01:21:58,218 --> 01:22:00,822
It can be ejected
and flown down separately.

974
01:22:01,623 --> 01:22:05,125
-What?
-It was a secret military
operation.

975
01:22:05,159 --> 01:22:07,127
I'm surprised these CEOs
even know about it.

976
01:22:07,161 --> 01:22:08,162
W-Wait.

977
01:22:08,195 --> 01:22:11,231
C-Can we go down
with it?

978
01:22:12,801 --> 01:22:16,103
It's not made for passengers
and can't be steered.

979
01:22:16,136 --> 01:22:19,973
Without Navicon
we can only detach it
at a calculated moment and...

980
01:22:20,007 --> 01:22:21,408
hope for the best.

981
01:22:22,209 --> 01:22:23,845
But theoretically,

982
01:22:23,878 --> 01:22:27,147
we could board it
if we adapted it for passengers.

983
01:22:29,349 --> 01:22:31,519
Hannah, what the fuck?
Why didn't you tell me

984
01:22:31,553 --> 01:22:33,187
that there was another chance
for re-entry?

985
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:35,489
Because
it's not a serious option.
Okay?

986
01:22:46,601 --> 01:22:49,604
Three people against 300.

987
01:22:53,974 --> 01:22:57,244
Yes, or even more
if other bunkers made it.

988
01:23:04,819 --> 01:23:06,588
I think we should do it.

989
01:23:06,621 --> 01:23:09,122
If we don't try, then it's done
for them down there.

990
01:23:09,156 --> 01:23:10,792
We can't let that happen.

991
01:23:11,893 --> 01:23:13,962
This is bigger than us, right?

992
01:23:17,866 --> 01:23:19,132
Right?

993
01:24:40,582 --> 01:24:43,985
You, asshole,
disconnected the Vesta
from the cooling cycle.

994
01:24:44,953 --> 01:24:46,688
We almost died because of you.

995
01:24:49,222 --> 01:24:51,826
I didn't want, I just--

996
01:24:53,126 --> 01:24:55,597
I just wanted a delay.

997
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:57,197
It was an accident.

998
01:24:59,801 --> 01:25:02,502
Yeah, I didn't know
the valves can close up.

999
01:25:02,537 --> 01:25:05,105
I couldn't let what happened
to Danilo happen to us.

1000
01:25:05,138 --> 01:25:07,341
Bullshit.

1001
01:25:07,374 --> 01:25:10,812
You just did it
because you're a selfish coward.

1002
01:25:19,486 --> 01:25:21,154
You know what this is?

1003
01:25:21,956 --> 01:25:24,058
Yeah.

1004
01:25:24,092 --> 01:25:26,094
And you know what it does?

1005
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:29,162
I found out at some point, yes.

1006
01:25:29,196 --> 01:25:32,800
Good.
'Cause that's what we'll do now.

1007
01:25:32,834 --> 01:25:36,537
We will pump back
the symbiosis cultures
in here and we will fly down.

1008
01:25:37,972 --> 01:25:41,943
So you knew about IKARUS
all of this time?

1009
01:25:41,976 --> 01:25:44,112
And you didn't say anything?

1010
01:25:51,085 --> 01:25:52,920
You didn't want this either.

1011
01:25:55,489 --> 01:25:57,190
Did you?

1012
01:25:57,224 --> 01:25:58,425
Gavin is right.

1013
01:25:59,259 --> 01:26:00,528
We need to help.

1014
01:26:02,362 --> 01:26:06,534
There is no shame
in caring for your own life,
Hannah.

1015
01:26:07,902 --> 01:26:09,369
Especially now.

1016
01:26:09,403 --> 01:26:10,538
Stop it.

1017
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:21,649
Have you ever asked yourself
why Nibra needed the algae
so bad all of a sudden?

1018
01:26:21,683 --> 01:26:24,552
I mean, for years
they didn't give a fuck.

1019
01:26:24,585 --> 01:26:26,954
Suddenly they want everything,
now.

1020
01:26:26,988 --> 01:26:28,523
They need the system now.

1021
01:26:28,556 --> 01:26:31,526
They send you to space
to get it, why?

1022
01:26:31,559 --> 01:26:33,161
Why, now?

1023
01:26:33,193 --> 01:26:34,862
What are you trying to say?

1024
01:26:36,631 --> 01:26:37,799
They knew.

1025
01:26:42,003 --> 01:26:45,238
They knew a catastrophe
was coming.

1026
01:26:46,741 --> 01:26:48,408
They just didn't tell anyone.

1027
01:26:49,577 --> 01:26:51,079
And why would they?

1028
01:26:51,112 --> 01:26:53,614
They didn't want to share
their bunkers.

1029
01:26:56,784 --> 01:26:58,686
Do you really think,

1030
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:04,158
they would give you their algae,
if it was the other way around?

1031
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:18,338
We've made a decision.

1032
01:27:18,371 --> 01:27:21,943
We're sending the algae lab
down to you, like you asked.

1033
01:27:21,976 --> 01:27:24,145
But we're coming with it.

1034
01:27:24,178 --> 01:27:27,915
<i>Okay,</i>
<i>we're looking forward to that.</i>

1035
01:27:27,949 --> 01:27:30,618
Wait, one more thing
before we start.

1036
01:27:30,651 --> 01:27:33,253
I need to talk
to one of the soldiers.

1037
01:27:35,388 --> 01:27:38,593
<i>But I am our representative.</i>

1038
01:27:38,626 --> 01:27:41,294
Yes, but IKARUS
is a military mission, so.

1039
01:27:42,429 --> 01:27:45,566
<i>Eh... okay.</i>

1040
01:27:47,969 --> 01:27:51,939
<i>The thing is...</i>
<i>there are no soldiers here.</i>

1041
01:27:56,409 --> 01:27:59,279
But you said the soldiers
brought you into the bunkers.

1042
01:28:01,582 --> 01:28:06,087
<i>Yes, they brought us here,</i>
<i>but... we have limited space.</i>

1043
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:08,923
<i>We have room for 300 civilians.</i>

1044
01:28:10,258 --> 01:28:11,458
<i>Families.</i>

1045
01:28:11,491 --> 01:28:12,627
So what? You...

1046
01:28:13,861 --> 01:28:15,362
You just left them outside?

1047
01:28:15,963 --> 01:28:16,998
To die?

1048
01:28:18,465 --> 01:28:20,568
<i>They did their duty.</i>

1049
01:28:22,236 --> 01:28:24,005
That was Nibra's order?

1050
01:28:24,038 --> 01:28:27,374
For all evacuation soldiers?

1051
01:28:27,407 --> 01:28:29,744
<i>Hannah, it is your job</i>
<i>to keep us alive!</i>

1052
01:28:30,745 --> 01:28:32,847
You lied.

1053
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,917
<i>No, we didn't lie.</i>

1054
01:28:35,950 --> 01:28:40,353
<i>You just assumed</i>
<i>what you wanted to believe.</i>

1055
01:28:40,387 --> 01:28:42,957
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>but what were you thinking?</i>

1056
01:28:48,328 --> 01:28:50,798
<i>All we want is to live,</i>
<i>nothing more.</i>

1057
01:28:50,832 --> 01:28:53,466
<i>We want our kids to survive.</i>

1058
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:56,403
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>you can't blame us for that.</i>

1059
01:29:03,945 --> 01:29:09,750
Fuck! Ugh!

1060
01:29:29,237 --> 01:29:31,205
Come on, get off the floor.

1061
01:29:31,239 --> 01:29:33,207
No, I'm done.

1062
01:29:33,241 --> 01:29:35,710
Hannah, they'll run out
of oxygen within days.

1063
01:29:35,743 --> 01:29:39,013
Yeah, and why would
cannon fodder like me care?

1064
01:29:39,046 --> 01:29:42,316
They didn't give a shit
about me. Or Knopf.

1065
01:29:42,350 --> 01:29:43,985
Or my parents.

1066
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:49,824
Apparently, money and privilege
don't get you a spot
in the bunker either.

1067
01:29:51,926 --> 01:29:54,695
You know that there
are children down there
too, right?

1068
01:29:55,863 --> 01:29:57,231
And what about this one?

1069
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,636
You said that
we couldn't raise it here.

1070
01:30:01,669 --> 01:30:03,938
Why actually not? I mean...

1071
01:30:03,971 --> 01:30:07,308
this place is better
than anywhere I lived before.

1072
01:30:07,341 --> 01:30:09,310
Growing old here?

1073
01:30:09,343 --> 01:30:11,178
Never seeing Earth?

1074
01:30:11,212 --> 01:30:12,780
What kind of a life is that?

1075
01:30:14,181 --> 01:30:15,616
At least a life.

1076
01:30:22,757 --> 01:30:24,457
I... I don't get it.

1077
01:30:24,491 --> 01:30:28,129
Are you just hurt
or do you really want this baby?

1078
01:30:28,162 --> 01:30:31,332
See, I don't know, okay?

1079
01:30:31,365 --> 01:30:34,101
I never thought
about having a child.

1080
01:30:34,135 --> 01:30:36,938
Having a family
meant going back to being poor.

1081
01:30:36,971 --> 01:30:38,873
Not obeying meant being poor.

1082
01:30:38,906 --> 01:30:40,908
A soldier
doesn't even have that choice.

1083
01:30:42,610 --> 01:30:44,412
And that choice
is more important

1084
01:30:44,444 --> 01:30:46,347
than saving
the rest of our world.

1085
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:48,481
Yes.

1086
01:30:48,516 --> 01:30:51,419
You wouldn't understand that,
domer.

1087
01:30:51,451 --> 01:30:55,056
For someone like you,
it's easy playing
"Save the World."

1088
01:30:55,089 --> 01:30:58,059
But not everyone has a daddy
who sends him up here for safety

1089
01:30:58,092 --> 01:31:00,027
if everything else
goes down the drain.

1090
01:31:02,495 --> 01:31:04,165
Is that really what you think?

1091
01:31:08,235 --> 01:31:09,270
Huh.

1092
01:32:15,069 --> 01:32:16,537
Gavin?

1093
01:32:41,896 --> 01:32:42,897
Open the door.

1094
01:32:47,802 --> 01:32:49,503
I'm finishing what we started.

1095
01:32:50,539 --> 01:32:52,206
Are you leaving me behind?

1096
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:54,642
No, but I just need
to finish up.

1097
01:32:54,675 --> 01:32:56,010
Just wait.

1098
01:32:56,043 --> 01:32:57,878
How can you know
I won't stop you?

1099
01:33:00,748 --> 01:33:03,617
Because you're a good person.

1100
01:33:03,651 --> 01:33:05,352
And you know that this is right.

1101
01:34:42,183 --> 01:34:44,084
Hannah, wait! Stop!

1102
01:34:45,386 --> 01:34:46,387
Gavin, stop it!

1103
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:47,388
Please, move!

1104
01:34:47,421 --> 01:34:51,959
No! Gavin! Gavin! Gavin!

1105
01:34:53,628 --> 01:34:55,296
Don't--

1106
01:34:55,329 --> 01:34:56,931
Stop it!

1107
01:34:56,964 --> 01:34:58,332
I can't let you do this.

1108
01:35:19,621 --> 01:35:23,558
Hannah, can--
can we talk about this? I--

1109
01:35:23,592 --> 01:35:27,394
I can't.
I just don't want to.

1110
01:35:29,698 --> 01:35:30,965
Hannah, please just...

1111
01:35:40,542 --> 01:35:41,576
Fuck!

1112
01:35:54,421 --> 01:35:57,258
Hannah,
You can fix this, right?

1113
01:35:58,292 --> 01:35:59,426
Hannah?

1114
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:03,665
I'm sorry... I wanna stay.

1115
01:38:40,555 --> 01:38:41,823
Gavin?

1116
01:38:48,830 --> 01:38:49,864
Gavin?

1117
01:41:37,999 --> 01:41:39,033
Come on.

1118
01:41:40,467 --> 01:41:42,770
Let's see
if we can fix IKARUS somehow.

1119
01:41:43,805 --> 01:41:45,673
Yeah, what?

1120
01:41:47,075 --> 01:41:48,108
Why?

1121
01:41:50,545 --> 01:41:54,181
We need three breathers
or the gas mix collapses.

1122
01:41:54,214 --> 01:41:55,248
Your words.

1123
01:42:01,623 --> 01:42:05,860
You... You think Gavin did it...

1124
01:42:06,493 --> 01:42:07,829
Yeah.

1125
01:42:07,862 --> 01:42:09,530
He forced his will on us.

1126
01:42:11,032 --> 01:42:12,299
He got what he wanted.

1127
01:42:20,642 --> 01:42:24,078
-What?
-No... No, no, no...

1128
01:42:27,115 --> 01:42:29,249
We need three breathers, right?

1129
01:42:38,126 --> 01:42:41,261
Dimitri?

1130
01:42:41,294 --> 01:42:43,131
I said it after he tried to...

1131
01:42:43,196 --> 01:42:46,868
I just-- I just didn't want him
to harm himself.

1132
01:42:51,673 --> 01:42:53,541
I wanted to save him.

1133
01:43:02,449 --> 01:43:03,918
Stop.

1134
01:43:03,951 --> 01:43:06,286
-I'm sorry. I didn't...
-Okay, just stop.

1135
01:43:36,918 --> 01:43:38,218
No, no, no!

1136
01:43:38,251 --> 01:43:41,455
<i>Nein, nein,</i>
no, now.

1137
01:43:41,488 --> 01:43:44,291
- I got you. I do.
- No, no, no!

1138
01:43:44,324 --> 01:43:46,728
Let's go. <i>Pashli!</i>

1139
01:43:49,197 --> 01:43:51,065
Let's go!

1140
01:43:51,099 --> 01:43:55,770
<i>Eins, zwei, drei!</i>

1141
01:43:55,803 --> 01:43:57,905
You!

1142
01:43:58,673 --> 01:44:00,508
Good night, yes?

1143
01:44:00,541 --> 01:44:03,644
Okay! <i>Warte, warte.</i>

1144
01:44:50,290 --> 01:44:56,764
<i>Hello, hello?</i>
<i>Is there anyone? Hello? Hello?</i>

1145
01:44:56,798 --> 01:44:58,666
Hello?

1146
01:44:58,699 --> 01:45:00,467
<i>Look, guys,</i>
<i>the thing is working.</i>

1147
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:02,103
<i>Give it to me! Hello?</i>

1148
01:45:02,136 --> 01:45:04,839
Are you in there? In the box?

1149
01:45:04,872 --> 01:45:08,341
<i>No,</i>
<i>we are in the southern camps.</i>

1150
01:45:08,375 --> 01:45:10,511
<i>-And you? What's your name?</i>
-Knopf.

1151
01:45:10,545 --> 01:45:13,581
- <i>Knopf...</i>
<i>- Where are you?</i>

1152
01:45:13,614 --> 01:45:15,850
Eh... Rubikon.

1153
01:45:15,883 --> 01:45:18,186
<i>Can you play outside</i>
<i>there again too?</i>

1154
01:45:18,219 --> 01:45:21,889
No, Mom says
we can't breathe outside.

1155
01:45:21,923 --> 01:45:24,357
<i>So he must still be somewhere</i>
<i>up North.</i>

1156
01:45:24,391 --> 01:45:27,427
<i>Hey, shh.
</i> <i>Well, then ask her</i> <i>if you can come down here.</i>

1157
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:30,198
<i>The grown-ups</i>
<i>are always searching</i>
<i>for survivors anyway.</i>

1158
01:45:30,231 --> 01:45:33,768
<i>They say we must help</i>
<i>each other cause everything</i>
<i>is different now.</i>

1159
01:45:33,801 --> 01:45:36,469
<i>Stop it!</i>
<i>Seriously, can't you come?</i>

1159
01:45:37,305 --> 01:46:37,365
