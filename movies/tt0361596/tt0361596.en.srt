<i>Was it all just a dream?</i>

3
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,429
God bless you, Florida! Thank you!

4
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,475
<i>Did the last four years not really happen?</i>

5
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,272
<i>Look! There is Ben Affleck.
<i>He's often in my dreams.

6
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,441
<i>And the Taxi Driver <i>guy.
<i>He was there too!</i></i></i>

7
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:10,279
<i>And little Stevie Wonder.
<i>He seemed so happy, like a miracle

8
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,947
<i>had taken place.</i>

9
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,783
<i>Was it a dream?</i>

10
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,246
<i>Or was it real?</i>

11
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,000
<i>It was election night 2000,</i>

12
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,002
<i>and everything seemed
<i>to be going as planned.

13
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:26,211
<i>In New York,</i>

14
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:27,588
<i>Al Gore is our projected winner.</i>

15
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,506
<i>The Garden State is green for Gore.</i>

16
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:32,426
<i>We project Mr. Gore
<i>the winner in Delaware.

17
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,511
<i>This state has voted with the winner.</i>

18
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,847
Excuse me one second,
I'm so sorry to interrupt you.

19
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,516
Mike, I wouldn't do this
if it weren't big!

20
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,602
Florida goes for Al Gore.

21
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:46,023
CNN announces that we call
Florida in the Al Gore column.

22
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,526
<i>Then, something
<i>called The Fox News Channel

23
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,862
<i>called the election
<i>in favor of the other guy.

24
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,031
I interrupt you,
Fox News now projects

25
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:55,908
George W. Bush the winner in Florida,

26
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:59,369
and thus it appears the winner
of the Presidency of the United States.

27
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,622
<i>All of a sudden,
<i>the other network said:

28
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,625
<i>"Hey, if Fox said it, it must be true!"</i>

29
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,628
All of us at the networks
made a mistake

30
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,923
and projected Florida
in the Al Gore column.

31
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:11,965
It was our mistake.

32
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,635
<i>What most people don't know is</i>

33
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,138
<i>that the man who was in charge
<i>of the decision desk at Fox that night,

34
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,682
<i>the man who called it for Bush,
<i>was none other

35
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,268
<i>than Bush's first cousin,
<i>John Ellis.

36
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,897
<i>How does someone like Bush
<i>get away with something like this?

37
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,778
<i>Well, first, it helps
<i>if your brother is the governor

38
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,196
<i>of the State in question.</i>

39
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,365
You know something?
We are gonna win Florida.

40
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:37,991
Mark my words.

41
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,701
You can write it down.

42
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:43,247
<i>Second, make sure
<i>the chairman of your campaign is also

43
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,374
<i>the vote count woman,
<i>and that her state

44
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,417
<i>has hired a company</i>

45
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,127
<i>that's gonna knock voters
<i>off the rolls

46
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,879
<i>who aren't likely to vote for you.</i>

47
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,675
<i>You can usually tell them
<i>by the color of their skin.

48
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:58,136
<i>Then make sure your side fights
<i>like it's life or death.

49
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:02,474
I think all this talk
about legitimacy is way overblown.

50
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,434
President Bush! President Bush!

51
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,436
<i>And hope that the other side</i>

52
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,356
<i>will just sit by
<i>and wait for the phone to ring.

53
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:12,985
<i>And even if numerous
<i>independent investigations prove

54
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,903
<i>that Gore got the most votes.</i>

55
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,781
If there was a statewide recount,
under every scenario,

56
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,032
Gore won the election.

57
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,450
<i>It won't matter,</i>

58
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,203
<i>just as long as all your daddy's friends
<i>on the Supreme Court

59
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,997
<i>vote the right way.</i>

60
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:30,836
While I strongly disagree
with the Court's decision, I accept it.

61
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:34,298
What we need now, is acceptance.

62
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,467
We have a new president-elect.

63
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,638
<i>It turns out
<i>none of this was a dream.

64
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,640
<i>It's what really happened.</i>

65
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,479
<i>On the day the joint session
<i>of both the House of Representatives

66
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:53,275
<i>and the Senate was
<i>to certify the election results,

67
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:57,321
<i>Al Gore, in his dual role
<i>as outgoing Vice President

68
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,406
<i>and President of the Senate,</i>

69
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:03,160
<i>presided over the event
<i>that would officially anoint

70
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,954
<i>George W. Bush as the new president.</i>

71
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:10,292
<i>If any congressman wanted to raise
<i>an objection, the rules insisted

72
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:15,255
<i>that he or she had to have the signed
<i>support of just one Senator.

73
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:19,927
Mr. President, and I take great pride
in calling you that,

74
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,930
I must object because
of the overwhelming evidence

75
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,389
of official misconduct.

76
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,476
- Deliberate fraud--
- The Chair

77
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:30,604
must remind members
that under Section Eighteen

78
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,023
of Title Three, United States Code,

79
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,858
no debate is allowed
in the joint session.

80
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,486
Thank you, Mr. President,
to answer your question,

81
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,571
the objection is in writing,

82
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:43,325
signed by a number of members
of the House of Representatives,

83
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,619
but not by a member of the Senate.

84
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,413
Uh, Mr. President,
it is in writing and signed

85
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,251
by several House colleagues
on behalf, and myself,

86
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,337
of the 27,000 voters of Duval county,

87
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:59,091
in which 16,000 of them
are African Americans

88
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:03,011
that was disenfranchised
in this last election.

89
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,722
Is the objection signed
by a member of the Senate?

90
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:10,060
Not signed by a member of the Senate,
the Senate is missing.

91
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,729
Mr. President, it is in writing
and signed by myself,

92
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,607
on behalf of many of the diverse
constituents in our country,

93
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,193
especially those
in the Ninth Congressional district,

94
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,446
and all American voters
who recognize that the Supreme Court,

95
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,366
not the people of the United States,
decided this election.

96
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,035
Is the objection signed by a Senator?

97
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:31,373
Unfortunately, Mr. President,
it is not signed by one single Senator.

98
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,878
Unfortunately, I have no authority
over the United States Senate,

99
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,045
and no Senator has signed.

100
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:40,299
Mr. President,
it is in writing and signed by myself

101
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,719
and several of my constituents,
constituents from Florida.

102
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,846
A Senator is needed, but missing.

103
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,266
Is the objection in writing

104
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,644
and signed by a member
of the House and a Senator?

105
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,230
The objection is in writing,
and I don't care

106
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,358
that it is not signed
by a member of the Senate.

107
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:03,572
The Chair will advise
that the rules do care, and...

108
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,493
The signature of a Senator...

109
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,748
<i>Not a single Senator
<i>came to the aid of the African Americans

110
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:13,999
<i>in Congress.</i>

111
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,586
<i>One after another,
<i>they were told to sit down

112
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:19,421
<i>and shut up.</i>

113
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:22,549
It's a sad day in America,
Mr. President, when we can't find

114
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,761
- a Senator to sign objections.
- The gentleman!

115
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,221
The gentleman will suspend.

116
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,307
Won't sign objections,
Mr. President, I object!

117
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,434
The gentleman will suspend.

118
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,439
<i>Inauguration coverage 2001</i>

119
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:41,109
<i>on a nasty, but it could be
<i>a worse kind of day in Washington.

120
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,903
- <i>What do we want?
- Justice!</i>

121
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,488
- <i>When do we want it?
- Now!</i>

122
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,450
<i>On the day
<i>that George W. Bush was inaugurated,

123
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:52,871
<i>tens of thousands of Americans
<i>poured into the streets of D.C.

124
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,958
<i>in one last attempt to reclaim
<i>what had been taken from them.

125
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:01,755
<i>They pelted Bush's limo with eggs.</i>

126
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,299
Get back! Get back!

127
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,386
<i>And brought
<i>the inauguration parade to a halt.

128
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,974
<i>The plan to have Bush get out
<i>of the limo for the traditional walk

129
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,351
<i>to the White House was scrapped.</i>

130
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:18,272
<i>Bush's limo hit the gas
<i>to prevent an even larger riot.

<i>such a thing on his Inauguration Day.

132

<i>And for the next eight months,</i>

133
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:36,123
<i>it didn't get any better
<i>for George W. Bush.

134
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,127
<i>He couldn't get his judges appointed.</i>

135
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:43,463
<i>He had trouble getting
<i>his legislation passed,

136
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,508
<i>and he lost Republican control
<i>of the Senate.

137
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,762
<i>His approval ratings
<i>in the polls began to sink.

138
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:54,391
<i>He was already beginning

139
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,727
<i>With everything going wrong,</i>

140
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:59,021
<i>he did what any of us would do.</i>

141
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,607
<i>He went on vacation.</i>

144
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,330
Oh, no!

<i>42 % of the time.</i>

148
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,967
If I hit every shot good,

151

What about these folks that say

you're taking too long of a vacation?

153
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,357
They don't understand

I'm getting a lot done.

155
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:49,279
Secondly, you don't have to be
in Washington to work.

156
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,783
It's, uh... It's amazing, uh,

157
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,244
what can happen
with telephones and faxes.

158
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,371
Thank you so much, you were great.

159
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,834
What are you doing
the rest of the day?

160
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,003
Karen Hughes is coming over,
we're working on some things,

161
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,880
and uh...

162
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,551
She'll be over here, we'll be working
on a few things, a few matters.

163
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,469
I'm working on some initiatives.

164
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:15,180
We're, uh... You'll see!

165
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:18,267
I mean, I've got-- There'll be
some decisions that I will have made

166
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,061
while I'm here, and we'll be
announcing them as time goes on.

167
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,355
<i>The first time I met him,</i>

168
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,190
<i>he had some good advice for me.</i>

169
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:28,360
- Governor Bush, it's Michael Moore!
- Behave yourself, will you?

170
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,696
Go find real work!

171
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,366
<i>And work was
<i>something he knew a lot about!

172
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,118
Anybody want some grits?

173
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:37,452
Yeah!

174
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,830
<i>Relaxing at Camp David.</i>

175
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,999
<i>Yachting off Kennebunkport.</i>

176
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,042
How ya doing?

177
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:47,796
<i>Or being a cowboy
<i>on a ranch in Texas.

178
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:51,383
I love the nature, I love to get
in the pickup truck with my dogs.

179
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:52,885
Oh, hi!

180
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:56,180
<i>George Bush spent
<i>the rest of August at the ranch,

181
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,265
<i>where life was less complicated.</i>

182
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:01,185
Armadillos love to dig
the soil looking for bugs.

183
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,312
And...

184
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:08,025
So I went out there the other day,
and there was Barney!

185
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:12,529
Buried in this hole,
chasing an armadillo.

186
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:16,366
<i>It was a summer to remember.</i>

187
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,911
<i>And when it was over,
<i>he left Texas

188
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,246
<i>for his second favorite place.</i>

189
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,541
<i>On September tenth,
<i>he joined his brother in Florida,

190
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:28,086
<i>where he looked at files
<i>and met important Floridians.

191
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:34,927
<i>He went to sleep that night in a bed
<i>made with fine French linens.

192
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,071
Do you suppose he's pretty

193
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:56,990
confident on those numbers
on Iraqi security forces?

194
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:27,539
Make me look young!

195
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:42,721
I've got a little air noise.

196
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:46,350
Just don't turn it up too much,
I don't want to blow my head off.

197
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,108
<i>I got a... I got a mic here

202
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,934
Save their souls, Lord!

203
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,311
Save their souls, Lord!

204
00:14:57,189 --> 00:15:00,734
Oh, they're jumping! Everyone!

205
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:45,839
<i>On September 11th 2001,
<i>nearly 3,000 people,

206
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,841
<i>including a colleague of mine,</i>

207
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,343
<i>Bill Weems,</i>

208
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:53,555
<i>were killed in the largest foreign
<i>attack ever on American soil.

209
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,392
<i>The targets were the financial</i>

210
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,521
<i>and military headquarters
<i>of the United States.

211
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:04,233
If anyone has any idea, or if they've
seen him or knows where he is,

212
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,026
to call us!

213
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:08,070
He's got two little babies.

214
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:09,696
Two little babies.

215
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,616
<i>As the attack took place,</i>

216
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:16,119
<i>Mr. Bush was on his way
<i>to an elementary school in Florida.

217
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:20,832
<i>When informed of the first plane
<i>hitting the World Trade Center,

218
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:24,503
<i>where terrorists had struck,
<i>just eight years prior,

219
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:28,715
<i>Mr. Bush decided to go ahead
<i>with his photo opportunity.

220
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,594
Good morning!

221
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,430
Read this word
the fast way. Get ready!

222
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,516
- Mat!
- Yes, mat! Get ready!

223
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:38,684
Cat!

224
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:39,726
Yeah!

225
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,146
OK, get ready
to read the words on this page

226
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:44,439
without making a mistake!

227
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:47,568
<i>When the second plane
<i>hit the tower, his chief of staff

228
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:51,113
<i>entered the classroom
<i>and told Mr. Bush:

229
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,448
<i>"The nation is under attack."</i>

230
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,621
<i>Not knowing what to do,</i>

231
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:03,500
<i>with no one telling him what to do,
<i>and no secret service

232
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,336
<i>rushing in to take him to safety,</i>

233
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:12,217
<i>Mr. Bush just sat there
<i>and continued to read My Pet Goat

234
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:13,594
<i>with the children.</i>

235
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:31,904
<i>Nearly seven minutes passed
<i>with nobody doing anything.

236
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:39,995
<i>As Bush sat in that Florida classroom,</i>

237
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:43,624
<i>was he wondering if maybe he should
<i>have shown up to work more often?

238
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:47,961
<i>Should he have held at least
<i>one meeting since taking office

239
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:52,341
<i>to discuss the threat of terrorism
<i>with his head of counter-terrorism?

240
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:58,138
<i>Or maybe Mr. Bush was wondering
<i>why he had cut terrorism funding

241
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,473
<i>from the FBI?</i>

242
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:01,975
<i>Or perhaps, he just should have read</i>

243
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:06,730
<i>the security briefing that was given
<i>to him on August sixth 2001,

244
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:10,484
<i>which said that Osama Bin Laden
<i>was planning to attack America

245
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:12,569
<i>by hijacking airplanes.</i>

246
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:16,031
<i>But maybe he wasn't worried
<i>about the terrorist threat

247
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:19,284
<i>because the title
<i>of the report was too vague.

248
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:20,661
I believe the title was:

249
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,914
<i>Bin Laden determined
<i>to attack inside the United States.

250
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,124
<i>A report like that</i>

251
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:30,504
<i>might make some men jump,
<i>but as in days past,

252
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,923
<i>George W. Just went fishing.</i>

253
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:38,470
<i>As the minutes went by, George Bush
<i>continued to sit in the classroom.

254
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:44,685
<i>"I've been hanging
<i>out with the wrong crowd?

00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:50,607
<i>Which one of them screwed me?</i>

256
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:55,696
<i>Was it the guy my daddy's friends
<i>delivered a lot of weapons to?

257
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:59,116
<i>Was it that group
<i>of religious fundamentalists

258
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:01,869
<i>who visited my State
<i>when I was governor?

259
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:06,331
<i>Or was it the Saudis?</i>

260
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,544
<i>Damn, it was them!
<i>I think I better

261
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,212
<i>blame it on this guy!"</i>

262
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:21,513

263
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:25,642
<i>all commercial and private airline traffic
<i>was grounded.

264

<i>who wanted to fly?</i>

272
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,002
<i>No one, except the Bin Ladens.</i>

♪ <i>If it's the last thing we ever do ♪</i>

274
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,930
We had some airplanes authorized
at the highest levels of our government

275
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,557
to fly to pick up
Osama Bin Laden's family members

276
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:08,268
and others from Saudi Arabia
and transport them out of this country.

277
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:11,063
<i>It turns out that the White House
<i>approved planes

<i>to pick up the Bin Ladens
<i>and numerous other Saudis.

<i>At least six private jets

<i>including 24 members
<i>of the Bin Laden family,

<i>were allowed to leave the country.</i>

285
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,964
<i>Osama's always been
<i>portrayed as a bad apple,

286
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,424
<i>the black sheep in the family
<i>and that they cut off

287

all relationship with him
around 1994.

288
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:44,930
In fact, things are much more
complicated than that.

289
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:47,808
<i>You mean Osama's had
<i>contact with other family members?

290
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:51,144
<i>That's right, and in
<i>the summer of 2001, just before 9/11,

291
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,939
<i>one of Osama's sons
<i>got married in Afghanistan,

292

<i>- Bin Ladens?
<i>- That's right!

294
00:21:57,943 --> 00:22:01,655
So they're not cut off completely,
that's an exaggeration.

295
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:04,491
We now welcome to <i>Larry King Live,

298
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:12,416
You had about 24 members

299
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:13,750
- Here?
- In America!

it's not fair for those innocent

302
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:24,219
On the other hand,
we understood the high emotions,

00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:33,395
<i>Before 9/11, he was a senior agent</i>

306
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:37,191
<i>on the joint FBI/CIA Al-Qaeda task force.</i>

307
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:42,279
I, as an investigator, would not want
these people to have left.

308
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:44,948
I think in the case
of the Bin Laden family,

309
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:48,285
I think it would have been prudent,
hand the subpoenas out,

310
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:51,830
have them come in, get on the record!
You know, get on the record.

311
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:53,624
- That's the proper procedure?
- Yeah!

312
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,834
<i>How many people
<i>were pulled off airlines

313
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:58,378
after that, coming into the country
who were what?

314
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:01,590
They were from the Middle East
or they fit a very general picture.

315
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:03,926
- We held hundreds.
- We held hundreds, and I--

316
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:05,636
For weeks and months at a time.

317
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:07,137
Did the authorities do anything

318
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:09,014
when the Bin Ladens tried
to leave the country?

319
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:11,767
No, they were identified at the airport.

320
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:15,812
They looked at their passports
and they were identified.

321
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:17,523
Well, that's what would happen
to you or I.

322
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:18,690
Exactly! Exactly!

323
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:20,776
So, a little interview,
check the passport, what else?

324
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:21,902
Nothing.

325
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:26,907
<i>I don't know
<i>about you, but, usually,

326
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:29,076
<i>when the police can't find a murderer,</i>

327
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:31,745
<i>don't they usually want to talk</i>

328
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:35,541
<i>to the family members to find out
<i>where they think he might be?

329
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:37,417
Do you have no idea
where your husband might be?

330
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,253
If you should hear anything,
let us know.

331
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,421
You want to come downtown,
give us a statement?

332
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:43,257
- Is this gonna take long?
- You got the time.

333
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:44,883
Mine's worth money, yours isn't.

334
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,593
- Send us the bill!
- I asked you a question!

335
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,928
You're here to answer them.

336
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:49,680
Now, listen to me, cop,
I pay your salary!

337
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:50,806
Sit down, I'll earn it.

338
00:23:50,973 --> 00:23:53,058
<i>Yeah, that's how cops do it.</i>

339
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:54,518
<i>What was going on here?</i>

340
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:57,020
I think we need to know
a lot more about that.

341
00:23:57,187 --> 00:24:00,065
That needs to be the subject
of a significant investigation.

342
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:01,733
What happened? How did it happen?

343
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,485
Why did it happen,
and who authorized it?

344
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:07,990
Try to imagine
what those poor bastards were feeling

345
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:11,618
when they were jumping
out of that building to their death.

346
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:15,914
Those... those... those young guys
and cops and firemen that ran

347
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:19,543
into that building,
never asked a question, and they're dead.

348
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:22,087
And families' lives are ruined.

349
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:24,882
And they'll never,
they'll never have peace.

350
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:27,968
And if I had to inconvenience...

351
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:33,724
A... A member of the Bin Laden family
with a subpoena or a grand jury,

352
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:36,435
do you think I'd lose any sleep over it?
Not for a minute, Mike.

353
00:24:36,602 --> 00:24:38,437
- No one would question it.
- No, it's right.

354
00:24:38,604 --> 00:24:40,480
Not even the biggest civil libertarian?

355
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:42,357
- No, no, it's just...
- No one would question.

356
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:45,485
You know, you got a lawyer? Fine.
Counsellor, fine!

357
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:47,821
Mr. Bin Laden, this is why I'm asking you,

358
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:49,698
it's not because I think
that you're anything,

359
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:52,618
I just want to ask you the questions
that I would anybody.

360
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:54,369
- Right.
- And that's all!

361
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:57,706
<i>None of this made any sense.</i>

362
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:02,794
<i>Can you imagine in the days
<i>after the Oklahoma City terrorist bombing

363
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,630
<i>President Clinton helping to arrange</i>

364
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:07,925
<i>a trip out of the country
<i>for the McVeigh family?

365
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,512
<i>What do you think would have happened
<i>to Clinton if that had been revealed?

366
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:13,931
Burn him! Burn him!

367
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:16,600
Prince Bandar,
do you know the Bin Laden family?

368
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:17,768
I do very well.

369
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:20,521
- What are they like?
- They're really lovely human beings.

370
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,689
He is the only one I never...

371
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,983
I don't know him well,
but I met him only once.

372
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,361
What was the circumstance
under which you met him?

373
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:31,990
This is ironic, in the mid-80s,
if you remember,

374
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:34,076
<i>we and the United States
<i>were supporting the Mujahedeen.

375
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,995
<i>To liberate</i>

376
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:38,789
<i>Afghanistan from the Soviets!</i>

377
00:25:38,956 --> 00:25:41,750
<i>He came to thank me for my efforts</i>

378
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:45,504
<i>to bring the Americans, our friends,
<i>to help us against the atheists,

379
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:47,673
<i>he said, the Communists.
<i>Isn't it ironic?

380
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,383
<i>Now, he came to thank you</i>

381
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,010
<i>for helping bring America to help him?</i>

382
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:55,264
And now, he may be responsible
for bombing America?

383
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,306
Absolutely.

384
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:58,433
What did you make of him
when you met him?

385
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,227
I was not impressed,
to be honest with you.

386
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:01,728
- Not impressed?
- No, ha was...

387
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:04,314
I thought he was simple
and very quiet guy.

388
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:08,610
<i>Hmm... A simple and quiet guy?</i>

389
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:13,323
<i>Whose family just happened to have
<i>a business relationship

390
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,285
<i>with the family of George W. Bush.</i>

391
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:20,122
<i>Is that what he was thinking about?</i>

392
00:26:21,707 --> 00:26:24,001
<i>Because if the public knew this,</i>

393
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:26,253
<i>it wouldn't look very good.</i>

394
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:31,091
<i>Was he thinking, you know:</i>

395
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:34,928
<i>"I need a big black marker"?</i>

396
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:41,310
<i>In early 2004, in a speech
<i>during the New Hampshire primary,

397
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:44,313
<i>I called George W. Bush a deserter</i>

398
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:47,024
<i>from his time
<i>in the Texas Air National Guard.

399
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:49,526
<i>In response, the White House</i>

400
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:54,072
<i>released his military records
<i>in the hopes of disproving the charge.

401
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:58,577
<i>What Bush didn't know
<i>is that I already had a copy

402
00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:00,329
<i>of his military records,</i>

403
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:03,665
<i>uncensored,
<i>obtained in the year 2000,

404
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:08,086
<i>and there is one glaring difference
<i>between the records released in 2000

405
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:11,215
<i>and those he released in 2004.</i>

406
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:17,095
<i>A name had been blacked out.</i>

407
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:21,391
<i>In 1972, two airmen were
<i>suspended for failing

408
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:24,603
<i>to take their medical examination.</i>

409
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,189
<i>One was George W. Bush.</i>

410
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:33,779
<i>And the other was James R. Bath.</i>

411
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:39,576
<i>In 2000,
<i>the documents show both names.

412
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:46,416
<i>But in 2004, Bush and the White House
<i>had Bath's name blacked out.

413
00:27:48,085 --> 00:27:51,588
<i>Why didn't Bush want the press
<i>and the public to see Bath's name

414
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:53,674
<i>on his military records?</i>

415
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:57,219
<i>Perhaps he was worried
<i>that the American people would find out

416
00:27:57,386 --> 00:27:59,930
<i>that at one time James R. Bath</i>

417
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:03,475
<i>was the Texas money manager
<i>for the Bin Ladens.

418
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:07,187
<i>Bush and Bath had become good friends</i>

419
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:10,566
<i>when they both served
<i>in the Texas Air National Guard.

420
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:12,693
<i>After they were discharged,</i>

421
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,404
<i>when Bush's dad
<i>was head of the CIA,

422
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:17,823
<i>Bath opened his own aviation business</i>

423
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,576
<i>after selling a plane
<i>to a man by the name

424
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,703
<i>of Salem Bin Laden,</i>

425
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:26,039
<i>heir to the second largest fortune
<i>in Saudi Arabia,

426
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:28,250
<i>the Saudi Binladin Group.</i>

427
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:29,543
<i>W., at that time,</i>

428
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,796
<i>was just starting off
<i>in the world as a businessman.

429
00:28:32,963 --> 00:28:35,674
Because he's a guy who's always
tried to emulate his father,

430
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:37,843
he decided to go
into the oil business.

431
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,970
<i>He founded an oil company,
<i>a drilling company,

432
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:41,889
<i>out in west Texas called Arbusto,</i>

433
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:46,226
<i>which was very, very good at drilling
<i>dry holes that nothing came out of.

434
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:49,146
<i>But the question has always been,
<i>where did this money come from?

435
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:50,189
<i>Now, his dad,</i>

436
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:53,692
his dad was rich.
His dad could have done this for him.

437
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:55,944
But his dad didn't do this for him.

438
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:57,988
There's no indication that Daddy
wrote a check

439
00:28:58,155 --> 00:29:00,073
to start him off in this company.

440
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:03,702
<i>So where did
<i>George W. Bush get his money?

441
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:04,870
I'm George Bush!

442
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:08,916
<i>One person who did
<i>invest in him was James R. Bath.

443

<i>Bush's good friend, James Bath,
<i>was hired by the Bin Laden family

444
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:19,134
<i>to manage their money
<i>in Texas and invest in businesses.

445
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:28,477
<i>And James Bath himself, in turn,
<i>invested in George W. Bush.

446
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:34,274
<i>Bush ran Arbusto into the ground,</i>

447
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:37,236
<i>as he did every other company
<i>he was involved in.

448
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:41,240
<i>Until, finally, one of his companies
<i>was bought by Harken Energy.

449

<i>And they gave him
<i>a seat on their board.

450
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:47,162
<i>A lot of us had suspected</i>

00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:50,666
through the years,
that there has been Saudi oil money

452
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:52,292
involved in all of these companies.

453
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:56,255
Harken, Spectrum Seven,
Arbusto Drilling,

454
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:57,673
all of the Bush companies.

455
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,843
Whenever they got into trouble,
there were these angel investors

456
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:02,845
who flowed money into the companies.

457
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:07,516
So, the question is, why Saudis,
who had all the oil in the world,

458
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:12,479
go around the globe
to invest in this lousy oil company?

459
00:30:12,646 --> 00:30:14,606
And the thing is it had one big asset,

460
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:18,819
Harken had one thing going for it,
which is that George W. Bush

461
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:20,362
was on its board of directors

462
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:23,532
at a time when his father was
President of the United States.

463
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:27,035
When you're the president's son,
and you've got unlimited access,

464
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:30,414
combined with some credentials
from a prior campaign,

465
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:33,667
in Washington D.C.,
people tend to respect that.

466
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:35,252
And, access is power.

467
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:39,965
And, uh, I can find my dad
and talk to him any time of the day.

468
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:43,677
<i>Yes, it helps to be the president's son,</i>

469
00:30:43,844 --> 00:30:45,929
<i>especially when you're being investigated</i>

470
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:48,223
<i>by the Securities
<i>and Exchange Commission.

471
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,393
<i>In 1990, when Mr. Bush
<i>was a Director of Harken Energy,

472
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,645
<i>he received this memo
<i>from company lawyers

473
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:55,898
<i>warning directors not to sell stock</i>

474
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:58,692
<i>if they had unfavorable information
<i>about the company.

475
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:03,071
<i>One week later, he sold
<i>$848,000 worth of Harken stock.

476
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:06,992
<i>Two months later, Harken announced losses
<i>of more than $23,000,000.

477
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:08,994
<i>The James Baker law partner</i>

478
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:11,955
<i>who helped Bush beat
<i>the rap from the SCC

479
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:15,334
<i>was a man by the name
<i>of Robert Jordan, who,

480
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:19,379
<i>when George W. Became president,
<i>was appointed ambassador

481
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:21,340
<i>to Saudi Arabia.</i>

482
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:27,179
<i>After the Harken debacle,</i>

483
00:31:27,346 --> 00:31:30,974
<i>the friends of Bush's dad
<i>got him a seat on another board

484
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:34,394
<i>of a company owned
<i>by the Carlyle group.

485
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:36,438
We wanted to look at which companies

486
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:38,106
actually gained from September 11th.

487
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:40,692
<i>Turned up this company,
<i>Carlyle Group.

488
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:41,735
<i>The Carlyle Group is</i>

489
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:43,987
<i>a multinational conglomerate that invests</i>

490
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:47,950
<i>in heavily government-regulated
<i>industries like telecommunications,

491
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:50,786
<i>healthcare,
<i>and particularly, defense.

492
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:54,665
<i>Both George W. Bush
<i>and George H. W. Bush

493
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:56,291
<i>worked for the Carlyle Group,</i>

494
00:31:56,458 --> 00:32:00,420
<i>the same company that counted
<i>the Bin Laden family among its investors.

495
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:05,050
Carlyle Group was holding
its annual investor conference

496
00:32:05,217 --> 00:32:07,010
on the morning of September 11th

497
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,639
<i>in the Ritz Carlton Hotel
<i>in Washington D.C. At that meeting,

498
00:32:10,806 --> 00:32:14,268
<i>were all of the Carlyle regulars,</i>

499
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:15,978
<i>James Baker, likely John Major,</i>

500
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:18,105
<i>definitely George H. W. Bush,</i>

501
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:20,649
<i>though he left the morning
<i>of September 11th,

502
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:24,570
Shafiq Bin Laden,
who is Osama Bin Laden's half-brother

503
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:26,530
and was in town to look after

504
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:29,825
<i>his family's investments
<i>in the Carlyle Group,

505
00:32:29,992 --> 00:32:32,744
<i>um, all of them together
<i>in one room watching

506
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:36,081
<i>as the planes hit the towers.</i>

507
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:38,500
And then in fact,
the Bin Laden family was invested

508
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:42,337
in one of their defense funds,
which ironically meant

509
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:45,132
that, um,
as the United States started

510
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:49,178
increasing its defense spending,
the Bin Laden family stood to gain

511
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:51,722
from those investments
through the Carlyle Group.

512
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:55,809
Our Commander-in-chief,
our president, George W. Bush!

513
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:59,521
<i>With all
<i>the weapons companies it owned,

514
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:01,440
<i>the Carlyle Group was in essence</i>

515
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:04,943
<i>the eleventh largest defense
<i>contractor in the United States.

516
00:33:05,611 --> 00:33:06,612
Thanks a lot!

517
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:08,989
<i>It owned United Defense,</i>

518
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:12,743
<i>makers of the Bradley armored
<i>fighting vehicle.

519
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,496
<i>September 11th guaranteed
<i>that United Defense

520
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:19,625
<i>was going to have a very good year.</i>

521
00:33:22,044 --> 00:33:24,379
<i>Just six weeks after 9/11,</i>

522
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:27,341
<i>Carlyle filed to take
<i>United Defense public,

523
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:30,344
<i>and in December, made a one day profit</i>

524
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:34,181
<i>of 237 million dollars, but sadly,</i>

525
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:37,643
<i>with so much attention
<i>focused on the Bin Laden family

526
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:39,978
<i>being important Carlyle investors,</i>

527
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:43,357
<i>the Bin Ladens eventually
<i>had to withdraw,

528
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:46,068
<i>Bush's dad, though,
<i>stayed on as Senior Advisor

529
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:49,905
<i>to Carlyle's Asia Board
<i>for another two years.

530
00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:51,698
<i>As unseemly as it seems,</i>

531
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:56,036
uh, to...
know that George H. W. Bush

532
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:58,872
was meeting with the Bin Laden family

533
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,751
while Osama was a wanted terrorist,

534
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:04,837
way before September 11th.

535
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:09,675
It's very discomforting
for Americans to know that.

536
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:14,513
<i>George H. W. Bush is a man who has,
<i>obviously, incredible reach

537
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,181
<i>into the White House.</i>

538
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,184
He receives daily CIA briefings,

539
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:21,895
which is the right of any ex-president,

540
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:26,191
but very few ex-presidents actually
exercise that right, he does.

541
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:29,403
<i>And I think in a very real way,</i>

542
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,655
<i>they are benefiting
<i>from the confusion that arises

543
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:35,909
<i>when George H. W. Bush visits
<i>Saudi Arabia, on behalf of Carlyle,

544
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:39,705
<i>and meets with the royal family
<i>and meets with the Bin Laden family.

545
00:34:39,872 --> 00:34:40,747
<i>Um...</i>

546
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:44,418
<i>Is he representing
<i>the United States of America

547
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:46,753
<i>or is he representing
<i>an investment firm

548
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,464
<i>in the United States of America
<i>or is he representing both?

549
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:52,885
<i>This company is about money, it's not
<i>about conspiracies to run the world

550
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:57,556
<i>or you know engineer political
<i>maneuvering, things like that.

551
00:34:57,723 --> 00:35:00,684
It's about making money,
and it's about making a lot of money,

552
00:35:00,851 --> 00:35:02,644
and they've done very well.

553
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:07,441
If I can get you
on the record on this question.

554
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:12,321
In the White House view,
there is no ethical conflict

555
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:16,742
in former President Bush
and former Secretary of State,

556
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:20,787
Jim Baker, using their contacts
with world leaders to represent

557
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:25,876
one of the most well-known military
arms dealers, the Carlyle Group?

558
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:29,922
The president has full faith
that his family

559
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:33,050
will conform with all proper
ethics laws, all ethics laws,

560
00:35:33,217 --> 00:35:34,676
and will act properly in their conduct.

561
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:37,095
<i>OK,
<i>so let's say one group of people,

562
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:38,764
<i>like the American people,</i>

563
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:41,642
<i>pay you $400,000 a year to be</i>

564
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:43,101
<i>President of the United States.</i>

565
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:46,355
<i>But then another group of people
<i>invest in you,

566
00:35:46,522 --> 00:35:47,439
<i>your friends</i>

567
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:49,775
<i>and their related businesses</i>

568
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:52,402
<i>1.4 billion dollars
<i>over a number of years,

569
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:53,779
<i>who are you gonna like?</i>

570
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:55,322
<i>Who's your daddy?</i>

571
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:56,365
Over here, sir!

572
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:59,076
<i>Because that's how much
<i>the Saudi Royals and their associates

573
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:00,410
<i>have given the Bush family.</i>

574
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:03,622
<i>- Their friends...
- How are you, Sir?</i>

575
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:06,708
<i>...and their related businesses
<i>in the past three decades.

576
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:09,461
We've had
a very nice reunion with friends.

577
00:36:09,628 --> 00:36:11,964
<i>Is it rude
<i>to suggest that when the Bush family

578
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,340
<i>wakes up in the morning,</i>

579
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:16,468
<i>they might be thinking

599

started immediately.

603

It's important for us to, uh...

606
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:57,569
not reveal how we collect information!

607
00:37:57,736 --> 00:38:00,531
That's what the enemy wants.
And we're fighting an enemy.

608
00:38:00,697 --> 00:38:02,616
<i>When he couldn't stop Congress,</i>

609
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:06,870
<i>he then tried to stop an independent
<i>9/11 commission from being formed.

610
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:09,164
The president's position
was a break from history.

611
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:12,584
Independent investigations were
launched within days of Pearl Harbor

612
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:14,461
and President Kennedy's assassination.

613
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:17,548
<i>But when Congress
<i>did complete its own investigation,

614
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:20,843
<i>the Bush White House censored
<i>28 pages of the report.

615
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:23,387
<i>The president is
<i>being pressed by all sides

616
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:25,055
<i>to declassify the report.</i>

617
00:38:25,222 --> 00:38:27,558
<i>U.S. officials tell NBC News
<i>most of the secret source

618
00:38:27,724 --> 00:38:29,810
<i>involve Saudi Arabia.</i>

619
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:32,729
We have given
extraordinary cooperation

620
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:35,691
with chairmen Keane and Hamilton.

621
00:38:35,858 --> 00:38:37,568
We haven't gotten
the materials we needed,

622
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:39,862
and we certainly haven't
gotten them in a timely fashion.

623
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:41,697
The deadlines we set have passed.

624
00:38:41,864 --> 00:38:43,907
Will you testify
before the commission?

625
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:45,492
This commission?

626
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:49,162
You know, I don't, testify.
I mean, I'd be glad to visit with them.

627
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:52,374
What it will do is,
the hole that's in my heart,

628
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:56,461
and has been in my heart
since September 11th,

629
00:38:56,628 --> 00:38:59,464
I lost my husband of fifteen years.

630
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:02,509
I am now by myself. Um...

631
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:06,430
I need to know what happened to him.

632
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:12,144
I know what I got back,
from the... the autopsy.

633
00:39:12,311 --> 00:39:13,187
Uh...

634
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:17,232
That man was my life,
and I have no plan.

635
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:20,152
I took a... I was taking a class,

636
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:23,697
and they asked me what was I going
to do in the next five years.

637
00:39:23,864 --> 00:39:26,158
And if I'm not doing something with this,

638
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:28,577
I don't know what reason
I have to live.

639
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:30,954
So, it's very important.

640
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:33,498
Very important.

641
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:36,502
OK? Thank you.

642
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:40,964
<i>Ignored by the Bush administration,</i>

643
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:44,176
<i>more than 500 relatives
<i>of 9/11 victims

644
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:47,346
<i>filed suit
<i>against Saudi royals and others.

645
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:49,598
<i>For lawyers,
<i>the Saudi Defense Minister

646
00:39:49,765 --> 00:39:52,559
<i>hired to fight the 9/11 families,</i>

647
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:57,397
<i>the law firm of Bush family confident,
<i>James A. Baker.

648
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:01,818
So, right here in the center
of three important American landmarks,

649
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:04,780
the Watergate hotel and office building,

650
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:07,616
the Kennedy center over there,

651
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:11,828
and the embassy of Saudi Arabia.

652
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:14,206
Yeah!

653
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:18,210
How much money do the Saudis
have invested in America, roughly?

654
00:40:18,377 --> 00:40:22,339
I've heard figures
as high as 860 billion dollars.

655
00:40:22,506 --> 00:40:24,299
860 billion?

656
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:25,467
Billion!

657
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:27,761
- That's a lot of money!
- A lot!

658
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:29,680
And, uh...

659
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,850
what, what percentage of our economy
does that represent?

660
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:34,059
It seems like a lot.

661
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:36,770
Well, in terms
of in investments on Wall Street,

662
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:38,897
American equities, it's roughly

663
00:40:39,064 --> 00:40:41,692
six or seven percent of America.

664
00:40:42,234 --> 00:40:44,319
They own a fairly
good slice of America.

665
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:47,573
And most of that money goes
into the great blue chip companies.

666
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:52,077
Citigroup, Citibank is
the largest stockholder is a Saudi.

667
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:55,914
AOL Time Warner
has big Saudi investors.

668
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:59,126
So, I read
the Saudis have a trillion dollars

669
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:02,212
in our banks, of their money.
What would happen if like, one day,

670
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:04,047
they just pulled
that trillion dollars out?

671
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:05,507
A trillion dollars?

672
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:07,467
That would be
an enormous blow to the economy.

673
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:08,802
Right, right.

674
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:10,345
Mr. Moore,
can I speak to you for a moment?

675
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:11,471
Yeah, sure!

676
00:41:11,638 --> 00:41:13,348
- How are you?
- Good, how are you doing?

677
00:41:13,515 --> 00:41:15,392
Steve Kimball, Secret Service.
How are you, Sir?

678
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:17,686
We're just ascertaining
information regarding...

679
00:41:17,853 --> 00:41:19,229
- Oh, OK.
- Are you doing a documentary

680
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:21,398
regarding the Saudi Arabia embassy,
the chancellery?

681
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:23,442
No, I am doing a documentary.

682
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:25,277
- Right.
- Part of it is about Saudi Arabia.

683
00:41:25,444 --> 00:41:27,863
<i>Even though we were
<i>nowhere near the White House,

684
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,532
<i>for some reason,
<i>the Secret Service had shown up

685
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:33,702
<i>to ask us what we were doing
<i>standing across the street

686
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:34,953
<i>from the Saudi embassy.</i>

687
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,997
We're not here to cause
any trouble or anything,

688
00:41:37,164 --> 00:41:39,541
uh, you know. Is that...

689
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,335
No, that's fine.
We just wanted to make sure,

690
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:43,837
just wanted to get some information
as far as what was actually going on.

691
00:41:44,004 --> 00:41:44,880
Yeah.

692
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:48,258
I didn't realize the Secret Service
guards foreign embassies.

693
00:41:48,425 --> 00:41:49,843
Not usually. No, sir.

694
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,346
No, no. Do they give you any trouble,
the Saudis?

695
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:54,306
Uh, no comment on that, sir.

696
00:41:54,473 --> 00:41:56,558
Oh, OK, I'll take that as a yes.

697
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:58,185
Alright, good.
Thank you very much.

698
00:41:58,352 --> 00:42:00,270
<i>It turns out that Saudi Prince Bandar</i>

699
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:03,398
<i>is perhaps the best protected
<i>ambassador in the U.S.

700
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:07,861
<i>The U.S. State Department provides him
<i>with a six-man security detail.

701
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:09,738
<i>Considering how he and his family</i>

702
00:42:09,905 --> 00:42:12,950
<i>and the Saudi elite
<i>own seven percent of America,

703
00:42:13,116 --> 00:42:15,619
<i>it's probably not a bad idea.</i>

704
00:42:17,663 --> 00:42:19,623
<i>Prince Bandar
<i>was so close to the Bushes,

705
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,583
<i>they considered him
<i>a member of the family

706
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:25,921
<i>and they even had
<i>a nickname for him, Bandar Bush.

707
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:28,131
<i>Two nights after September 11th,</i>

708
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:30,425
<i>George Bush invited Bandar Bush</i>

709
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:33,720
<i>over to the White House
<i>for a private dinner and a talk.

710
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:37,391
<i>Even though Bin Laden was a Saudi,</i>

711
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:40,394
<i>and Saudi money had funded Al-Qaeda,</i>

712
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:44,189
<i>and 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis.</i>

713
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:47,276
<i>Here was the Saudi ambassador
<i>casually dining

714
00:42:47,442 --> 00:42:50,028
<i>with the president on September 13th.</i>

715
00:42:51,613 --> 00:42:53,866
<i>What were they talking about?</i>

716
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:57,578
<i>Were they commiserating?
<i>Or comparing notes?

717
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:01,623
<i>Why would Bandar's government</i>

718
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:04,209
<i>block American investigators</i>

719
00:43:04,376 --> 00:43:07,296
<i>from talking to the relatives
<i>of the 15 hijackers?

720
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,176
<i>Why would Saudi Arabia become reluctant</i>

721
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:14,595
<i>to freeze the hijacker's assets?</i>

722
00:43:18,223 --> 00:43:20,642
<i>The two of them walked out
<i>on the Truman Balcony

723
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:24,021
<i>so that Bandar could smoke
<i>a cigar and have a drink.

724
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:30,110
<i>In the distance, across the Potomac,
<i>was the Pentagon, partially in ruins.

725
00:43:31,028 --> 00:43:34,573
<i>I wonder if Mr. Bush told
<i>Prince Bandar not to worry,

726
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:38,118
<i>because he already
<i>had a plan in motion.

727
00:43:39,745 --> 00:43:43,457
You come in September 12th
ready to plot what response

728
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:45,626
we take to Al-Qaeda.
Let me talk to the...

729
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:48,629
about the response that you got
from top administration officials.

730
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:51,507
On that day,
what did the president say to you?

731
00:43:51,673 --> 00:43:55,093
The president, in a very intimidating way,
left us, me and my staff,

732
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,055
with the clear indication

733
00:43:58,222 --> 00:44:01,225
that he wanted us to come back
with the word that there was an Iraqi hand

734
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:04,228
behind 9/11, because they had been
planning to do something

735
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:06,396
about Iraq from before the time
they came into office.

736
00:44:06,563 --> 00:44:07,606
Did he ask about any other

737
00:44:07,773 --> 00:44:09,274
- nations other than Iraq?
- No. No, no.

738
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:12,611
No, not at all, it was
"Iraq, Saddam, find out, get back to me!"

739
00:44:12,778 --> 00:44:15,656
And were his questions more
about Iraq than about Al-Qaeda?

740
00:44:15,822 --> 00:44:18,617
Absolutely. Absolutely!
He didn't ask me about Al-Qaeda.

741
00:44:18,784 --> 00:44:21,745
<i>The reaction you got from
<i>the Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld

742
00:44:21,912 --> 00:44:23,747
<i>and from his assistant Paul Wolfowitz?</i>

743
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:25,123
Well, Donald Rumsfeld said

744
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:28,836
when we talked about bombing the Al-Qaeda
infrastructure in Afghanistan,

745
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:31,338
he said there were no good targets
in Afghanistan.

746
00:44:31,505 --> 00:44:33,048
"Let's bomb Iraq!"

747
00:44:33,215 --> 00:44:35,801
"But Iraq had nothing to do with this."

748
00:44:35,968 --> 00:44:37,761
And that didn't seem
to make much difference.

749
00:44:37,928 --> 00:44:39,847
<i>And the reason they had to do
<i>Afghanistan first

750
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:42,933
<i>was it was obvious
<i>that Al-Qaeda had attacked us

751
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,811
<i>and it was obvious
<i>that Al-Qaeda was in Afghanistan.

752
00:44:45,978 --> 00:44:47,688
The American people
wouldn't have stood by

753
00:44:47,855 --> 00:44:49,523
if we had done
nothing on Afghanistan.

754
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:08,834
<i>The United States
<i>began bombing Afghanistan

755
00:45:09,001 --> 00:45:13,213
<i>just four weeks after 9/11,
<i>Mr. Bush said he was doing so

756
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,382
<i>because the Taliban government
<i>of Afghanistan

757
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:17,801
<i>had been harboring Bin Laden.</i>

758
00:45:19,094 --> 00:45:20,804
I will smoke them out of their holes.

759
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:22,347
We'll smoke them out!
Smoke him out!

760
00:45:22,514 --> 00:45:23,807
Smoke him out of his cave!

761
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:26,226
Let's rush him and smoke him out!

762
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,312
<i>For all this tough talk,</i>

763
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:31,440
<i>Bush really didn't do much.</i>

764
00:45:31,607 --> 00:45:34,776
But, what they did was slow and small.

765
00:45:34,943 --> 00:45:38,030
They put only 11,000 troops
into Afghanistan.

766
00:45:38,197 --> 00:45:39,781
There are more police here in Manhattan,

767
00:45:39,948 --> 00:45:43,619
more police here in Manhattan
than there are U.S. troops in Afghanistan.

768
00:45:43,785 --> 00:45:46,580
<i>Basically the president botched
<i>the response to 9/11,

769
00:45:46,747 --> 00:45:47,748
he should have gone after Bin Laden,

770
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:49,958
<i>the U.S. Special Forces
<i>didn't get into the area

771
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:53,045
where Bin Laden was for two months!

772
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:54,922
<i>Two months?</i>

773
00:45:55,714 --> 00:45:57,007
<i>A mass murderer</i>

774
00:45:57,174 --> 00:46:00,135
<i>who attacked the Unites States
<i>was given a two months head start?

775
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:02,596
<i>Who in their right mind
<i>would do this?

776
00:46:04,723 --> 00:46:06,225
Anybody say nice shot?

777
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:08,310
Nice shot! Hell of a shot.

778
00:46:08,477 --> 00:46:10,187
<i>Or was the war in Afghanistan</i>

779
00:46:10,354 --> 00:46:12,231
<i>really about something else?</i>

780
00:46:12,397 --> 00:46:15,567
<i>Perhaps the answer
<i>was in Houston, Texas.

781
00:46:18,654 --> 00:46:22,241
<i>In 1997, while George W. Bush
<i>was governor of Texas,

782
00:46:22,407 --> 00:46:25,160
<i>a delegation of Taliban leaders
<i>from Afghanistan

783
00:46:25,744 --> 00:46:28,872
<i>flew to Houston to meet
<i>with Unocal executives

784
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:32,459
<i>to discuss the building
<i>of a pipeline through Afghanistan,

785
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:35,879
<i>bringing natural gas from the Caspian Sea.</i>

786
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:38,257
<i>And who got a Caspian Sea
<i>drilling contract

787
00:46:38,423 --> 00:46:41,218
<i>the same day Unocal signed
<i>the pipeline deal?

788
00:46:41,385 --> 00:46:44,596
<i>A company headed by a man
<i>named Dick Cheney,

789
00:46:44,763 --> 00:46:45,681
<i>Halliburton.</i>

790
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:47,558
<i>From the point of view
<i>of the U.S. government,

791
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:50,394
this was kind of a magic pipeline,

792
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:53,522
um, because it could serve
so many purposes.

793
00:46:53,689 --> 00:46:55,941
<i>And who else stood
<i>to benefit from the pipeline?

794
00:46:57,901 --> 00:47:00,696
<i>Bush's number one
<i>campaign contributor, Kenneth Lay,

795
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,156
<i>and the good people of Enron.</i>

796
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:07,327
<i>Only the British press covered this trip.</i>

797
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:11,331
<i>Then in 2001, just five and a half
<i>months before 9/11,

798
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:16,003
<i>the Bush administration welcomed
<i>a special Taliban envoy

799
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:20,132
<i>to tour the United States to help improve
<i>the image of the Taliban government.

800
00:47:20,299 --> 00:47:22,259
You have imprisoned the women.

801
00:47:22,426 --> 00:47:23,886
It's a horror, let me tell you.

802
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:25,429
And I'm really sorry to your husband.

803
00:47:25,596 --> 00:47:27,347
He must have
a very difficult time with you.

804
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:29,391
<i>Here is the Taliban official visiting</i>

805
00:47:29,558 --> 00:47:32,853
<i>our State Department
<i>to meet with U.S. officials.

806
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:36,273
<i>Why on Earth would
<i>the Bush administration

807
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,526
<i>allow a Taliban leader
<i>to visit the United States,

808
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:42,029
<i>knowing that the Taliban
<i>were harboring the man

809
00:47:42,196 --> 00:47:44,281
<i>who bombed the USS Cole</i>

810
00:47:44,448 --> 00:47:46,283
<i>and our African embassies?</i>

811
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:50,537
<i>Well, I guess 9/11 put a stop to that.</i>

812
00:47:51,163 --> 00:47:53,290
<i>When the invasion
<i>of Afghanistan was complete,

813
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:56,043
<i>we installed its new president,</i>

814
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,920
<i>Hamid Karzai.</i>

815
00:47:58,086 --> 00:48:00,047
<i>Who was Hamid Karzai?</i>

816
00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:03,634
<i>He was a former advisor to Unocal.</i>

817
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,261
<i>Bush also appointed
<i>as our envoy to Afghanistan

818
00:48:07,054 --> 00:48:08,680
<i>Zalmay Khalilzad</i>

819
00:48:08,847 --> 00:48:11,892
<i>who was also a former Unocal advisor.</i>

820
00:48:13,685 --> 00:48:15,562
<i>I guess you can probably see</i>

821
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:17,314
<i>where this is leading.</i>

822
00:48:17,481 --> 00:48:20,275
<i>Faster than you can say
<i>"Black Gold, Texas Tea",

823
00:48:20,442 --> 00:48:23,320
<i>Afghanistan signed an agreement
<i>with their neighboring countries

824
00:48:23,487 --> 00:48:26,323
<i>to build a pipeline
<i>through Afghanistan

825
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:28,617
<i>carrying natural gas
<i>from the Caspian Sea.

826
00:48:29,326 --> 00:48:31,119
<i>Oh, and the Taliban?</i>

827
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:34,373
<i>Ah, they mostly got away.</i>

828
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:37,835
<i>As did Osama Bin Laden
<i>and most of Al-Qaeda.

829
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:41,088
<i>Terror is bigger than one person</i>

830
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:45,926
<i>and, he's just... He's a person
<i>who's now been marginalized.

831
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:47,803
So I don't know where he is, nor--

832
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:49,805
You know I just don't spend
that much time on him,

833
00:48:49,972 --> 00:48:51,181
to even be honest with you.

834
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:53,350
<i>"Didn't spend that much time on him?"</i>

835
00:48:53,517 --> 00:48:55,185
<i>What kind of president was he?</i>

836
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:57,229
I'm a war president.

837
00:48:57,396 --> 00:49:00,232
I make decisions here
in the Oval Office, uh,

838
00:49:00,399 --> 00:49:02,776
in foreign policy matters,
with war on my mind.

839
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:05,362
<i>With the war in Afghanistan over</i>

840
00:49:05,529 --> 00:49:07,114
<i>and Bin Laden, forgotten,</i>

841
00:49:07,281 --> 00:49:09,658
<i>the "war president" had a new target...</i>

842
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:13,787
<i>...the American people.</i>

843
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:21,044
We've got an unusual terror warning
from the Feds to tell you about.

844
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:25,549
Fox News has obtained an FBI bulletin
that warns terrorists could use pen guns,

845
00:49:25,716 --> 00:49:28,594
just like in James Bond,
filled with poison, as weapons.

846
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,388
Good evening everyone,
America is on high alert tonight,

847
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:33,140
just four days before Christmas.

848
00:49:33,307 --> 00:49:34,725
<i>A possible terror threat...</i>

849
00:49:34,892 --> 00:49:37,728
As bad as, or worse than 9/11.

850
00:49:37,895 --> 00:49:39,605
<i>But where? How?</i>

851
00:49:39,771 --> 00:49:41,523
<i>There's nothing specific to report.</i>

852
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,650
<i>Be on the lookout
<i>for model airplanes

853
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:44,735
<i>packed with explosives.</i>

854
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:50,824
And the FBI is warning ferries
may be considered particularly at risk

855
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:51,909
for hijacking.

856
00:49:54,286 --> 00:49:57,039
<i>Could these cattle
<i>be a target for terrorists?

857
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:02,503
- Fear works!
- Fear does work, yes!

858
00:50:02,669 --> 00:50:05,214
You can make people do
anything if they're afraid.

859
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:08,091
And how do you make them afraid?

860
00:50:08,258 --> 00:50:13,680
Well, you make them afraid
by creating an aura of endless threat.

861
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:15,432
They played us like an organ.

862
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,894
<i>They raised the...
<i>They lit the orange, and then up to red,

863
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:20,479
<i>and they dropped it back to orange.</i>

864
00:50:20,646 --> 00:50:24,691
I mean, they gave these mixed messages,
which were crazy making.

865
00:50:24,858 --> 00:50:27,319
The world has changed
after September 11th.

866
00:50:28,529 --> 00:50:30,739
It's changed
because we're no longer safe.

867
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:35,118
Fly and enjoy
America's great destination spots.

868
00:50:35,285 --> 00:50:37,621
We've entered
what may very well prove to be

869
00:50:37,788 --> 00:50:40,707
the most dangerous
security environment the world's known.

870
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:43,377
Take your families and enjoy life!

871
00:50:43,544 --> 00:50:45,629
Terrorists are doing everything they can

872
00:50:45,796 --> 00:50:48,257
to gain even deadlier means
of striking us.

873
00:50:48,966 --> 00:50:51,051
Get down to Disney World in Florida.

874
00:50:51,218 --> 00:50:52,761
It's like training a dog.

875
00:50:52,928 --> 00:50:55,722
You tell him "Sit down” and you tell him
to roll over at the same time,

876
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:56,932
dog doesn't know what to do.

877
00:50:57,099 --> 00:50:59,309
Well, the American people
were being treated like that.

878
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:04,940
It was really very, very skillfully
and ugly what they did.

879
00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:07,734
We must stop the terror!

880
00:51:07,901 --> 00:51:11,405
I call upon all nations
to do everything they can

881
00:51:11,572 --> 00:51:14,116
to stop these terrorists killers.

882
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:16,368
Thank you.

883
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:17,828
Now watch this drive.

884
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:22,541
Alright, hit another one!

885
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:28,213
They will continue, in my view, as long as
this administration is in charge,

886
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,467
of every once in a while
stimulating everybody to be afraid.

887
00:51:32,634 --> 00:51:33,927
Just in case you forgot.

888
00:51:34,261 --> 00:51:36,889
<i>It's not going to go down
<i>to green or blue.

889
00:51:37,055 --> 00:51:38,390
<i>It's never gonna get there.</i>

890
00:51:38,557 --> 00:51:41,393
There clearly is no way

891
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:45,480
that anyone
can live constantly on edge like that.

892
00:51:45,647 --> 00:51:48,192
The harsh reality facing
American families today

893
00:51:48,358 --> 00:51:50,777
is that they're not as safe
as they used to be.

894
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:53,822
Drug dealers and users
looking for their next fix.

895
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:57,159
Gangs who roam the streets
in search of their next victim,

896
00:51:57,326 --> 00:51:59,369
and the growing threat of terrorists

897
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:01,955
means the need
for protection is ever greater.

898
00:52:02,122 --> 00:52:04,291
And now, that protection is here.

899
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:06,919
Zytech Engineering, LLC has developed

900
00:52:07,085 --> 00:52:08,670
and tested a safe room

901
00:52:08,837 --> 00:52:11,256
finally affordable
to the average American citizen.

902
00:52:12,132 --> 00:52:13,926
<i>The kind of protection
<i>formerly obtainable

903
00:52:14,092 --> 00:52:15,844
<i>only by the wealthy or powerful.</i>

904
00:52:16,011 --> 00:52:19,515
Heck, you can be sitting in here
drinking your finest Bordeaux

905
00:52:19,681 --> 00:52:21,391
and enjoying life while

906
00:52:21,558 --> 00:52:23,018
chaos is erupting outside.

907
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:28,065
Every family in America
should prepare itself

908
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:29,650
for a terrorist attack.

909
00:52:29,816 --> 00:52:32,736
Now to escaping from a skyscraper,
John Rivers

910
00:52:32,903 --> 00:52:35,781
is the CEO
of the Executive Chute Corporation.

911
00:52:35,948 --> 00:52:38,742
- Good morning to you, John.
- Good morning, Matt.

912
00:52:38,909 --> 00:52:41,036
Tell me about the product
you're bringing to the market.

913
00:52:41,203 --> 00:52:45,415
It's an emergency escape chute.
It's an option of last resort.

914
00:52:45,582 --> 00:52:47,376
How high do you have
to be in the building

915
00:52:47,543 --> 00:52:50,295
for that chute
to actually take effect?

916
00:52:50,462 --> 00:52:53,257
You only have to be
on the tenth floor or above

917
00:52:53,423 --> 00:52:56,301
- They can put this on themselves?
- Right.

918
00:52:56,468 --> 00:52:59,054
They can put this on themselves
in as easy as about thirty seconds.

919
00:52:59,221 --> 00:53:00,597
It's really easy to put on.

920
00:53:01,807 --> 00:53:02,683
You...

921
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:03,851
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

922
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:06,061
Really easy to put on, but...

923
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:11,191
When you first get the chute,
you're gonna want to put it on

924
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:12,901
and try it on a few times yourself.

925
00:53:13,068 --> 00:53:15,571
Jamie's having a little
trouble putting that thing on,

926
00:53:15,737 --> 00:53:18,073
I mean, is this something that,
that you honestly think

927
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,703
in a moment of panic,
that someone can operate properly?

928
00:53:23,453 --> 00:53:25,247
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it is, it's...

929
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:29,376
Jamie's probably never put this thing
on before in her life, so...

930
00:53:30,252 --> 00:53:31,879
It's okay, don't worry about it.

931
00:53:32,045 --> 00:53:33,630
It's something that when you get it,

932
00:53:33,797 --> 00:53:35,424
you're gonna want
to put it on several times.

933
00:53:35,591 --> 00:53:37,926
Well, despite the raising
of the terror alert level,

934
00:53:38,093 --> 00:53:41,221
residents here in Saginaw are continuing
with their Christmas errands.

935
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:44,516
<i>Frances Stroik and her family do some
<i>last minute holiday shopping

939
00:53:52,941 --> 00:53:54,860
Midland is close-by.

940
00:53:55,027 --> 00:53:57,654
"Detroit's not far, that far away",

941
00:53:57,821 --> 00:53:59,239
"there could be something",

942
00:53:59,406 --> 00:54:04,244
and Flint could also be some,
be concerns for people around here.

943
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:07,206
Well you, you never know
where they're gonna hit.

944
00:54:07,372 --> 00:54:10,250
<i>One potential target
<i>specifically mentioned by the terrorists

945
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:12,544
<i>has security officials baffled.</i>

946
00:54:12,711 --> 00:54:17,132
<i>It's tiny Tappahannock, Virginia,
<i>population 2,016.

947
00:54:17,299 --> 00:54:20,302
<i>Such an attack
<i>could generate widespread fear.

948
00:54:20,469 --> 00:54:23,388
<i>That even here,
<i>in rural small town America,

949
00:54:23,555 --> 00:54:25,724
<i>no one is entirely safe.</i>

950
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:27,100
Oh, on the six o'clock news,

951
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:29,728
there was something about
a terrorist alert in Tappahannock.

952
00:54:30,354 --> 00:54:31,897
What did the FBI tell you?

953
00:54:32,064 --> 00:54:34,274
Well, they contacted me by phone.

954
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:36,985
Uh, basically to let me know
about this word Tappahannock,

955
00:54:37,152 --> 00:54:38,153
and that's how it started.

956
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,323
In their so-called chatter
that they pick up,

957
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:44,409
<i>they weren't sure, "Tappahannock",
<i>there's a "Rappahannock County".

958
00:54:44,576 --> 00:54:45,786
This is the "Rappahannock River".

959
00:54:46,203 --> 00:54:49,581
There is a Rappahannock,
a place called Rappahannock,

960
00:54:49,748 --> 00:54:50,791
and they got it mixed up.

961
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:53,961
This is Tappahannock,
not Rappahannock.

962
00:54:54,127 --> 00:54:55,754
Is there any terrorist target
around here?

963
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:57,256
Not that we can really think of.

964
00:54:57,422 --> 00:54:58,298
It can happen anywhere.

965
00:54:58,465 --> 00:55:00,801
- We have a Walmart here.
- We have a big spaghetti supper here.

966
00:55:01,718 --> 00:55:02,886
Walmart, probably!

967
00:55:03,053 --> 00:55:05,597
Do you feel suspicious of outsiders?

968
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:06,974
Oh, everybody does it.

969
00:55:08,058 --> 00:55:09,768
It's just something that happens.

970
00:55:09,935 --> 00:55:13,939
When I look at certain people,
- "Oh, my goodness!

971
00:55:14,106 --> 00:55:15,732
Do you think
they could be a terrorist?"

972
00:55:15,899 --> 00:55:18,402
- You never know what's gonna happen.
- It's right, you never know!

973
00:55:18,569 --> 00:55:19,695
It could happen right now.

974
00:55:21,029 --> 00:55:23,073
Never trust nobody you don't know!

975
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:26,368
And even if you do know them,
you really can't trust them then.

<i>Meet John Ashcroft, in 2000,</i>

986
00:56:11,622 --> 00:56:14,833
<i>he was running for re-election
<i>as Senator from Missouri

987
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,378

<i>The voters preferred the dead guy.</i>

<i>So, George W. Bush made him
<i>his Attorney General.

990
00:56:27,095 --> 00:56:29,473
<i>He was sworn in on a stack of Bibles,</i>

991
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:33,894
<i>'cause when you can't beat a dead guy,
<i>you need all the help you can get.

992
00:56:34,436 --> 00:56:36,313
<i>During the summer before 9/11,</i>

993
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,816
<i>Ashcroft told acting FBI director,
<i>Thomas Pickard,

994
00:56:39,983 --> 00:56:43,362
<i>that he didn't want to hear anything
<i>more about terrorist threats.

995
00:56:43,529 --> 00:56:48,033
Mr. Watson had come to you
and said that the CIA was very concerned

996
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,077
that there would be an attack.

997
00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:53,539
You said that you told
the Attorney General

998
00:56:53,705 --> 00:56:56,583
this fact repeatedly in these meetings.
Is that correct?

999
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,085
I told him

1000
00:56:58,252 --> 00:56:59,795
at least on two occasions.

1001
00:56:59,962 --> 00:57:01,672
And you told the staff,

1002
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:04,925
according to this statement,
that Mr. Ashcroft told you

1003
00:57:05,092 --> 00:57:07,845
that he did not want to hear
about this anymore.

1004
00:57:08,011 --> 00:57:09,221
Is that correct?

1005
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:10,681
That is correct.

1006
00:57:10,848 --> 00:57:12,224
<i>His own FBI knew that summer</i>

1007
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:15,477
<i>that there were
<i>Al-Qaeda members in the U.S.,

1008
00:57:15,644 --> 00:57:18,313
<i>and that Bin Laden was sending
<i>his agents to flight schools

1009
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,274
<i>around the country.</i>

1010
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:25,445
<i>But Ashcroft's Justice Department
<i>turned a blind eye and a deaf ear.

1011
00:57:25,904 --> 00:57:29,908
<i>But after 9/11,
<i>John Ashcroft had some brilliant ideas

1012
00:57:30,075 --> 00:57:31,952
<i>for how to protect America.</i>

1013
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:34,496
<i>The U.S.A.
<i>PATRIOT Act adopted by Congress

1014
00:57:34,663 --> 00:57:37,207
<i>and signed by Bush
<i>six weeks after the attacks

1015
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:39,293
<i>changed the way
<i>the government does business.

1016
00:57:39,459 --> 00:57:42,504
<i>The U.S.A. PATRIOT Act
<i>allows for searches of medical

1017
00:57:42,671 --> 00:57:45,632
<i>and financial records,
<i>computer and telephone conversations,

1018
00:57:45,799 --> 00:57:48,093
<i>and even for the books
<i>you take out of the library.

1019
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,220
<i>But most of the people we spoke to</i>

1020
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:53,724
<i>say they're willing to give up
<i>some liberties to fight terrorism.

1021
00:57:53,891 --> 00:57:54,975
Maybe that's a good thing.

1022
00:57:55,142 --> 00:57:58,228
It's definitely sad,
but it has to be done.

1023
00:57:58,687 --> 00:58:01,148
<i>Yes, something needed to be done.</i>

1024

<i>These are the good people
<i>who make up Peace Fresno.

<i>A community group in Fresno, California.</i>

1026
00:58:09,323 --> 00:58:10,991
<i>Unlike the rest of us,</i>

1027
00:58:11,158 --> 00:58:15,245
<i>they've received an early lesson
<i>in what the PATRIOT Act is all about.

<i>They sit around, they share stories.</i>

00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:24,963
<i>They eat cookies.</i>

1031
00:58:25,797 --> 00:58:27,633
<i>Some have more than one.</i>

1032
00:58:29,259 --> 00:58:31,220
<i>This is Aaron Stokes,</i>

1033
00:58:31,386 --> 00:58:32,763
<i>a member of Peace Fresno.</i>

1034
00:58:33,764 --> 00:58:35,307
<i>The other members liked him.</i>

1035
00:58:35,474 --> 00:58:38,018
<i>He had come
<i>to the meetings, he went with us,

1036
00:58:38,185 --> 00:58:39,478
we'd go out on Friday nights

1037
00:58:39,645 --> 00:58:42,314
and stand
on a very busy corner in Fresno,

1038
00:58:42,481 --> 00:58:45,692
and he had gone with us,
he had handed out flyers,

1039
00:58:45,859 --> 00:58:49,863
he went with us in June
to a W.T.O. protest.

1040
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:52,783
<i>Then one day,
<i>Aaron didn't show up to the meeting.

1041
00:58:53,242 --> 00:58:56,537
My friend Dan and I were reading
the Sunday newspaper,

1042
00:58:56,703 --> 00:59:00,123
and when I picked up the paper,
in the local section,

1043
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:01,959
<i>Aaron's picture caught my eye.</i>

1044
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:05,420
<i>The article said that a Sheriff's
<i>deputy had been killed

1045
00:59:05,587 --> 00:59:08,841
<i>and I saw it had a name
<i>that wasn't the right name.

1046
00:59:09,007 --> 00:59:14,346
<i>It said that he was a member
<i>of the sheriff's anti-terrorism Unit.

1047
00:59:14,972 --> 00:59:16,306
<i>That's right!</i>

1048
00:59:16,473 --> 00:59:18,851
<i>The photo of the man in the newspaper</i>

1049
00:59:19,017 --> 00:59:22,563
<i>was not the Aaron Stokes
<i>they had come to know.

1050
00:59:22,729 --> 00:59:25,816
<i>He was actually Deputy Aaron Kilner</i>

1051
00:59:25,983 --> 00:59:28,110
<i>and he had infiltrated their group.</i>

1052
00:59:29,111 --> 00:59:32,030
<i>Sheriff Pierce
<i>made it very clear that yes, in fact,

<i>Aaron Kilner was assigned
<i>to infiltrate Peace Fresno,

1054
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,495
that he was able

1055
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:40,372
that are open to the public.

1056

<i>You could understand why the police</i>

<i>needed to spy on a group
<i>like Peace Fresno.

<i>Barry likes to work out in the gym.</i>

1062
01:00:02,019 --> 01:00:05,397
<i>Somewhere between his cardio
<i>and his strength training,

1063
01:00:05,564 --> 01:00:07,274
<i>Barry got political.</i>

1064
01:00:08,025 --> 01:00:11,778
We were up in the gym
and it was after we were working out

1065
01:00:11,945 --> 01:00:16,450
and a number of us were talking
about 9/11 and Afghanistan and Bin Laden,

1066
01:00:16,617 --> 01:00:18,493
and someone said:

1067
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:21,872
"Bin Laden's a real asshole
for murdering those people."

1068
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:24,041
"Yeah that's true!

1069
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:27,586
But he will never be
as big an asshole as Bush,

1070
01:00:27,753 --> 01:00:30,422
who bombs all over
the world for oil profits."

1071
01:00:30,589 --> 01:00:33,842
<i>Barry didn't have
<i>to worry about the police spying on him.

1072
01:00:34,801 --> 01:00:38,263
<i>His fellow weight lifters were
<i>more than willing to turn him in.

1073
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:41,642
I was taking a nap,
and I guess it was 1:30 p.m.,

1074
01:00:41,808 --> 01:00:43,227
two o'clock in the afternoon,

1075
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,605
<i>and they came to my place and I said:</i>

1076
01:00:46,772 --> 01:00:49,274
"Well, who's there?"
- "The FBI."

1077
01:00:49,441 --> 01:00:50,567
"The FBI?"

1078
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:52,694
I mean, why are they here?

1079
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:54,821
<i>Yes, the FBI had come to see Barry,</i>

1080
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:58,200
<i>and they weren't
<i>there to Jazzercize.

1081
01:00:58,367 --> 01:00:59,952
<i>The FBI said:</i>

1082
01:01:00,118 --> 01:01:02,538
"Have you been talking
to people about 9/11

1083
01:01:02,704 --> 01:01:07,209
and about Bin Laden
and oil profits and Afghanistan?"

1084
01:01:07,376 --> 01:01:10,671
"A lot of people
are talking about these things."

1085
01:01:10,838 --> 01:01:14,883
And I feel my rights have been,
you know, trampled on.

1086
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:19,096
I mean, if you have something
to say to me in the gym, well, then, fine!

1087
01:01:19,263 --> 01:01:24,309
Don't tell the FBI and they come
to my apartment while I'm taking a nap.

1088
01:01:24,726 --> 01:01:27,813
There's nothing to be ashamed of here.
There is full transparency.

1089
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:31,275
There is nothing about the PATRIOT Act
that I am ashamed of

1090
01:01:31,441 --> 01:01:33,402
in any way, shape or form.

1091
01:01:33,569 --> 01:01:35,737
I have a 1-800 number, call me!

1092
01:01:35,904 --> 01:01:39,408
I'm the guy you call,
if there's a violation or abuse.

1093
01:01:39,575 --> 01:01:42,953
If you've got a poster child on this,
I wanna see it, that's what I do.

1094
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,831
I'm hired by the people
of the United States to provide oversight,

1095
01:01:45,998 --> 01:01:47,124
I provide oversight.

1096
01:01:47,291 --> 01:01:50,335
Trent Lott said
the day the bill was introduced:

1097
01:01:50,502 --> 01:01:54,590
"Maybe now we can do things we've wanted
to do for the last ten years."

1098
01:01:55,215 --> 01:01:57,926
You know, a dictatorship
would be a heck of a lot easier,

1099
01:01:58,093 --> 01:01:59,636
it's no question about it.

1100
01:01:59,803 --> 01:02:03,974
I mean, they had all this
on the shelf somewhere,

1101
01:02:04,141 --> 01:02:06,852
ideas of things they would like to do.

1102
01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:11,023
And they got 9/11 and they said:
"It's our chance! Go for it!"

1103
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:15,277
There was an immediate assumption
on the part of the Administration

1104
01:02:15,444 --> 01:02:20,574
that there had to be a surrender
of certain of our rights.

1105
01:02:20,741 --> 01:02:23,243
There's several definitions
in the Bill that are quite troubling.

1106
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:25,871
First of all,
the definition of "terrorist"!

1107
01:02:26,038 --> 01:02:31,960
It's so expansive
that it could include people--

1108
01:02:32,127 --> 01:02:33,670
Like me?

1109
01:02:33,837 --> 01:02:36,340
No one read it, that's the whole point!

1110
01:02:36,507 --> 01:02:39,426
They wait till the middle of the night,
they drop it in the middle of the night,

1111
01:02:39,593 --> 01:02:41,470
it's printed in the middle of the night,

1112
01:02:41,637 --> 01:02:43,972
and the next morning
when we come in, it passes.

1113
01:02:44,139 --> 01:02:46,183
Erm, how could Congress

1114
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:49,728
pass this PATRIOT Act
without even reading it?

1115
01:02:49,895 --> 01:02:51,188
Sit down, my son!

1116
01:02:52,314 --> 01:02:55,359
Uh, we don't read most of the bills.

1117
01:02:57,361 --> 01:03:00,113
Do you really know what that would entail

1118
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:04,326
if we were to read every bill
that we pass?

1119
01:03:05,827 --> 01:03:07,162
Uh...

1120
01:03:07,746 --> 01:03:11,416
Well the good thing, it would slow down
the legislative process.

1121
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:15,379
<i>I couldn't believe that
<i>virtually no member of Congress had read

1122
01:03:15,546 --> 01:03:17,756
<i>the PATRIOT Act before voting on it.</i>

1123
01:03:17,923 --> 01:03:22,261
<i>So I decided the only
<i>patriotic thing to do was for me

1124
01:03:22,427 --> 01:03:23,971
<i>to read it to them.</i>

1125
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:28,058
<i>Members of Congress,
<i>this is Michael Moore!

1126
01:03:28,225 --> 01:03:30,769
<i>I would like to read you
<i>the U.S.A. PATRIOT Act!

1127
01:03:30,936 --> 01:03:35,816
<i>Section one, section 210
<i>of this code reads as follows!

1128
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:37,776
<i>Section 2703 C.</i>

1129
01:03:37,943 --> 01:03:41,572
My job is to secure the homeland
and that's exactly what we're going to do.

1130
01:03:41,738 --> 01:03:43,365
But I'm here to take somebody's order.

1131
01:03:45,367 --> 01:03:46,952
That would be you, Stretch,
what would you like?

1132
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:49,496
- Right behind you!
- I'm gonna order some ribs!

1133
01:03:49,663 --> 01:03:53,208
<i>We all know you can't
<i>secure the homeland on an empty stomach.

1134
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:57,754
<i>And in order to remain secure,
<i>everyone needs to sacrifice.

1135
01:03:58,755 --> 01:04:01,466
<i>Especially little Patrick Hamilton.</i>

1136
01:04:02,593 --> 01:04:07,181
<i>I'm sure each of us has our own personal
<i>airport security horror story.

1137
01:04:08,348 --> 01:04:09,683
<i>But here's my favorite:</i>

1138
01:04:10,767 --> 01:04:15,147
<i>the terrorist threat that was posed
<i>by his mommy's breast milk.

1139
01:04:15,314 --> 01:04:18,901
I thought if I just put a little bit
on my lips, then that would be sufficient

1140
01:04:19,067 --> 01:04:20,444
because obviously I'm tasting it.

1141
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:23,113
And she looked at me
and I felt like she was telling me:

1142
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,366
"You need to chug that."
- "No, you need to drink more."

1143
01:04:26,533 --> 01:04:30,871
And of a four ounce bottle, I wound up
drinking two more ounces of breast milk

1144
01:04:31,038 --> 01:04:33,874
that, then, because it's touched my lips,
has to be tossed.

1145
01:04:34,499 --> 01:04:37,169
<i>While Homeland Security
<i>was making sure breast milk

1146
01:04:37,336 --> 01:04:38,837
<i>was kept off our planes,</i>

1147
01:04:39,338 --> 01:04:41,173
<i>they were also doing everything possible</i>

1148
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:44,510
<i>to ensure no one
<i>could light a fire bomb on board.

1149
01:04:44,676 --> 01:04:46,303
I can bring that on the plane?

1150
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:48,889
Actually, you can, yes, you're fine.

1151
01:04:49,056 --> 01:04:50,807
Oops! One too many books of matches.

1152
01:04:50,974 --> 01:04:53,685
You can have four books of matches
and two lighters.

1153
01:04:53,852 --> 01:04:57,314
When we already have the experience
of Richard Reid, the shoe bomber,

1154
01:04:57,481 --> 01:04:58,482
who would have

1155
01:04:58,649 --> 01:05:00,400
<i>blown up an airplane with his shoe bomb,</i>

1156
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:02,486
<i>had he had a butane lighter,
<i>according to the FBI,

1157
01:05:02,653 --> 01:05:05,197
why would the Transportation
Security Agency say it's okay

1158
01:05:05,364 --> 01:05:07,699
to take four books of matches
and two lighters in your pockets

1159
01:05:07,866 --> 01:05:08,867
as you board an airplane?

1160
01:05:09,034 --> 01:05:10,702
<i>I'm guessing that somebody</i>

1161
01:05:10,869 --> 01:05:13,497
<i>put pressure on them to say, you know:</i>

1162
01:05:13,664 --> 01:05:15,916
<i>"When an airplane lands,
<i>people want to light up pretty quickly,

1163
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:17,376
so don't take their lighters away."

1164
01:05:17,543 --> 01:05:19,545
<i>OK, let me see if I got this straight!</i>

1165
01:05:19,711 --> 01:05:21,630
<i>Old guys in the gym? Bad.</i>

1166
01:05:21,797 --> 01:05:23,549
<i>Peace groups in Fresno? Bad.</i>

1167
01:05:23,715 --> 01:05:25,676
<i>Breast milk? Really bad.</i>

1168
01:05:25,843 --> 01:05:28,345
<i>But matches and lighters on a plane?
<i>Oh, hey, no problem!

1169
01:05:28,512 --> 01:05:33,559
<i>Was this really about our safety?
<i>Or was something else going on?

1170
01:05:35,602 --> 01:05:40,566
<i>This is where the Pacific Ocean
<i>meets the shores of Oregon,

1171
01:05:40,732 --> 01:05:44,444
<i>over 100 miles of beautiful
<i>open coastline on our border.

1172
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:48,156
<i>And, thanks to the budget cutbacks,</i>

1173
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:51,743
<i>the total number of State police
<i>protecting it...

1174
01:05:52,953 --> 01:05:54,079
<i>One!</i>

1175
01:05:55,581 --> 01:05:56,790
<i>Part-time.</i>

1176
01:05:57,791 --> 01:05:59,126
<i>Meet trooper Brooks.</i>

1177
01:06:00,002 --> 01:06:03,672
I maybe get a chance
to hit this stretch of highway

1178
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:07,259
once, maybe twice
a week during my shifts.

1179
01:06:07,426 --> 01:06:11,221
Um, you know,
it's just to even drive up here and look.

1180
01:06:12,306 --> 01:06:13,765
You know, I mean, as far as I know,

1181
01:06:13,932 --> 01:06:16,059
somebody could...
There's lot of things they could do.

1182
01:06:16,226 --> 01:06:19,438
I don't even want to suspect,
because it just makes me ill inside.

1183
01:06:19,605 --> 01:06:21,732
<i>Back at the State trooper patrol office,</i>

1184
01:06:21,899 --> 01:06:26,653
<i>thanks to the budget cuts, trooper Kenyon
<i>had to come in on his day off to catch up

1185
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:28,155
<i>on some paperwork.</i>

1186
01:06:28,322 --> 01:06:31,074
For the most part, especially during
the summertime, when people show up,

1187
01:06:31,241 --> 01:06:33,535
this is exactly what they get,
they close the door,

1188
01:06:33,702 --> 01:06:36,371
they can read the sign
about the office closure,

1189
01:06:36,538 --> 01:06:39,958
and, it just basically explains that,
you know, due to our cutbacks,

1190
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:42,920
that our office is not open
for administrative business.

1191
01:06:43,086 --> 01:06:46,089
There's a little sign down at the bottom
that explains when the office is closed.

1192
01:06:46,256 --> 01:06:51,762
And that they can use the phone booth
to get in touch with our dispatch.

1193
01:06:52,471 --> 01:06:55,933
Ironically enough, that phone is a piece
of junk, it doesn't work very well,

1194
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:58,435
so, half the time,
when they pick up the phone

1195
01:06:58,602 --> 01:07:02,272
and dispatch gets a bunch of static
and they don't hear anything.

1196
01:07:02,898 --> 01:07:05,943
For Tuesday,
there'll be no troop on patrol.

1197
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:07,903
Wednesday,
there'll be no troop on patrol.

1198
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:10,239
Thursday,
there'll be no troop on patrol

1199
01:07:10,405 --> 01:07:14,034
You get calls all the time,
people will call in a suspicious vehicle,

1200
01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:16,662
or somebody looking suspicious,
you know...

1201
01:07:16,828 --> 01:07:19,831
And I don't hardly ever respond
to that anymore.

1202
01:07:19,998 --> 01:07:21,375
I just don't have the time to do it.

1203
01:07:21,542 --> 01:07:23,961
"How many people
do we have in this state of Oregon

1204
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:25,838
on duty tonight?"

1205
01:07:26,004 --> 01:07:30,717
And we had eight troopers on
for the entire state of Oregon working.

1206
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:35,889
I think, you know,
Oregon is a prime example

1207
01:07:36,056 --> 01:07:39,226
that homeland security
is not as secure as what,

1208
01:07:39,393 --> 01:07:41,603
I think, people would like to believe.

1209
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:44,606
Nobody's sent me any manual that says
here's how you catch a terrorist,

1210
01:07:44,773 --> 01:07:47,568
you know,
and if I had that manual, I'd read it.

1211
01:07:47,734 --> 01:07:49,069
But I don't, so...

1212
01:07:50,279 --> 01:07:51,280
Yeah...

1213
01:07:52,698 --> 01:07:55,450
<i>Of course, the Bush
<i>administration didn't hand out a manual

1214
01:07:55,617 --> 01:07:57,327
<i>on how to deal with the terrorist threat,</i>

1215
01:07:57,494 --> 01:08:01,540
<i>because the terrorist threat wasn't
<i>what this was all about.

1216
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:04,793
<i>They just wanted us to be fearful enough</i>

1217
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,630
<i>so that we'd get behind
<i>what their real plan was.

1218
01:08:13,594 --> 01:08:14,761
<i>Four minutes!</i>

1219
01:08:14,928 --> 01:08:15,888
Start from the top!

1220
01:08:16,054 --> 01:08:18,056
Okay. Alright?

1221
01:08:18,223 --> 01:08:20,142
How much time?

1222
01:08:20,309 --> 01:08:22,352
- <i>Three minutes!
- <i>Stand by!</i></i>

1223
01:08:25,522 --> 01:08:26,732
<i>30 seconds!</i>

1224
01:08:29,067 --> 01:08:30,402
Fifteen seconds!

1225
01:08:33,614 --> 01:08:38,493
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,

1226
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:42,372
four, three, two, one.

1227
01:08:43,123 --> 01:08:44,249
My fellow citizens!

1228
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:18,659
<i>At this hour,</i>

1229
01:09:18,825 --> 01:09:23,288
<i>American and coalition forces are
<i>in the early stages of military operations

1230
01:09:23,455 --> 01:09:28,794
<i>to disarm Iraq, to free its people,
<i>and to defend the world from grave danger.

1231
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:33,048
<i>On my orders, coalition forces have begun
<i>striking selected targets

1232
01:09:33,215 --> 01:09:36,093
<i>of military importance
<i>to undermine Saddam Hussein's

1233
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:38,095
<i>ability to wage a war.</i>

1234
01:10:01,076 --> 01:10:04,037
<i>On March 19th, 2003,</i>

1235
01:10:04,204 --> 01:10:07,457
<i>George W. Bush
<i>and the United States military

1236
01:10:07,624 --> 01:10:09,960
<i>invaded the sovereign nation of Iraq.</i>

1237
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:14,464
<i>A nation that had never attacked
<i>the United States.

1238
01:10:16,508 --> 01:10:20,429
<i>A nation that had never threatened
<i>to attack the Unites States.

1239
01:10:21,889 --> 01:10:25,642
<i>A nation that had never murdered
<i>a single American citizen.

1240
01:10:26,977 --> 01:10:30,772
What's this baby's crime?
Was he going to fight the soldiers?

1241
01:10:30,939 --> 01:10:33,984
Cowards! I went out with a bat
and asked the soldier to hit me.

1242
01:10:34,151 --> 01:10:39,698
I swear on the Quran.
Those who don't fear death don't die.

1243
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:52,628
Now, we're going to find this,
I think, piece of my neighbor, young girl.

1244
01:10:52,794 --> 01:10:54,838
Age twenty, Sham's.

1245
01:10:55,005 --> 01:10:58,884
I think is other part of her body.
That's all.

1246
01:11:01,345 --> 01:11:04,223
There is a lot of innocent civilians
that were killed

1247
01:11:04,389 --> 01:11:07,476
<i>and I think
<i>that's because the U.S. Army,

1248
01:11:07,643 --> 01:11:09,895
<i>you know, we came in,</i>

1249
01:11:10,062 --> 01:11:11,522
<i>and we knew it wasn't gonna be easy,</i>

1250
01:11:11,688 --> 01:11:14,191
and they pretty much at first,
shot anything that moved.

1251
01:11:14,358 --> 01:11:16,026
When war happens and the fighting starts,

1252
01:11:16,193 --> 01:11:19,029
you know, it's kinda like we're pumped up
and motivated and ready to go.

1253
01:11:19,196 --> 01:11:20,531
It's the ultimate rush.

1254
01:11:20,697 --> 01:11:23,158
'Cause you know you're going
into the fight to begin with,

1255
01:11:23,325 --> 01:11:25,869
and then you got a good song playing
in the background,

1256
01:11:26,036 --> 01:11:30,249
and that's... That gets you
real fired up, ready to do the job.

1257
01:11:30,415 --> 01:11:34,002
You can hook your CD player to the tank's
internal communications system.

1258
01:11:34,169 --> 01:11:35,212
To the Charlie box.

1259
01:11:35,379 --> 01:11:37,798
So that way, when you put your helmet on,
you can hear it through it.

1260
01:11:37,965 --> 01:11:41,009
This is the one we listen to the most,
this is the one we travel

1261
01:11:41,176 --> 01:11:42,594
when we kill the enemy,

1262
01:11:42,761 --> 01:11:44,763
Drowning Pool's
"Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"

1263
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:46,974
is just fitting for the job we were doing.

1264
01:11:53,897 --> 01:11:56,942
"The Roof is on Fire",
because basically it symbolized

1265
01:11:57,109 --> 01:11:58,861
Baghdad being on fire

1266
01:11:59,027 --> 01:12:01,822
and at the time we wanted it to burn
to get Saddam and his regime out.

1267
01:12:03,532 --> 01:12:06,076
♪ <i>The roof, the roof is on fire ♪</i>

1268
01:12:06,743 --> 01:12:10,247
♪ <i>We don't need no water
<i>Let the motherfucker burn ♪</i></i>

1269
01:12:10,914 --> 01:12:13,417
♪ <i>Burn, motherfucker, burn ♪</i>

1270
01:12:18,589 --> 01:12:22,217
♪ <i>Burn, motherfucker, burn ♪</i>

1271
01:12:24,595 --> 01:12:28,765
<i>This is a whole totally
<i>different picture here, being pushed into

1272
01:12:28,932 --> 01:12:30,976
the city, urban warfare in a tank,
you know!

1273
01:12:31,143 --> 01:12:33,270
<i>Civilians!</i>

1274
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:35,731
<i>Yeah, the civilians, it gets...</i>

1275
01:12:35,898 --> 01:12:37,983
<i>You don't know who's friendly,
<i>who's enemy.

1276
01:12:38,358 --> 01:12:41,570
<i>This was a lot more real
<i>and true than just a video game.

1277
01:12:41,737 --> 01:12:44,698
"Yeah, look through the sight and shoot!"

1278
01:12:44,865 --> 01:12:48,827
No, a lot of this is face to face,
and especially riding by

1279
01:12:48,994 --> 01:12:51,705
after the bombs that went off
and seeing all the people

1280
01:12:51,872 --> 01:12:54,458
<i>on the side of the road bloated up,
<i>and just...

1281
01:12:54,625 --> 01:12:58,337
<i>all the smells around you, I mean,
<i>from the people lying dead and rotted.

1282
01:12:58,504 --> 01:13:01,006
It's... It's a lot
more gruesome than you think.

1283
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:04,510
<i>We called in with some
<i>artillery and napalm and things like that.

1284
01:13:04,676 --> 01:13:06,637
<i>Some innocent women and children got hit.</i>

1285
01:13:07,054 --> 01:13:08,764
<i>We met them on the road and they had...</i>

1286
01:13:08,931 --> 01:13:11,558
I mean, little girls with noses blown off

1287
01:13:11,725 --> 01:13:16,230
and husbands carrying
their dead wives and things like that.

1288
01:13:16,396 --> 01:13:18,774
That was extremely difficult
to deal with 'cause you're like:

1289
01:13:18,941 --> 01:13:21,485
"Shoot, what the hell do we do now?"

1290
01:13:23,195 --> 01:13:26,031
The targeting capabilities
and the care that goes into targeting...

1291
01:13:29,952 --> 01:13:31,828
<i>...is as impressive...</i>

1292
01:13:31,995 --> 01:13:33,330
<i>...as anything, anyone could see.</i>

1293
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:38,585
<i>Ah, erm... I get one! The other one!</i>

1294
01:13:41,839 --> 01:13:45,050
The care that goes into it,
the humanity that goes into it!

1295
01:13:45,217 --> 01:13:48,178
They have no conscience!
They know nothing!

1296
01:13:48,345 --> 01:13:51,932
They slaughtered us!
They destroyed our houses!

1297
01:13:52,099 --> 01:13:55,060
God will destroy their houses!
God is great!

1298
01:13:55,227 --> 01:13:58,772
God will destroy their houses!
God is great!

1299
01:13:58,939 --> 01:14:01,316
God is great!
Victory to Iraq!

1300
01:14:01,483 --> 01:14:04,570
Victory to Iraq!
Victory to Iraq!

1301
01:14:05,988 --> 01:14:08,031
You mean they killed civilians?

1302
01:14:08,198 --> 01:14:10,826
Yes, civilians! It's our uncle's house!

1303
01:14:10,993 --> 01:14:14,538
We're all civilians.
There is no militia here.

1304
01:14:15,122 --> 01:14:17,749
I pray to God to avenge us!
I can only count on you, God!

1305
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:19,793
I can only count on you, God!

1306
01:14:23,213 --> 01:14:25,799
We've had five funerals
because of the bombings.

1307
01:14:25,966 --> 01:14:28,844
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

1308
01:14:31,847 --> 01:14:33,849
Oh, God!

1309
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:36,727
God save us from them!

1310
01:14:36,894 --> 01:14:38,270
God, where are you?

1311
01:14:38,437 --> 01:14:40,189
Where are you?

1312
01:14:44,568 --> 01:14:48,197
Honestly, I think we should just trust our
President in every decision that he makes

1313
01:14:48,363 --> 01:14:50,657
and we should just support that, you know,

1314
01:14:50,824 --> 01:14:53,368
and, um, be faithful in what happens.

1315
01:14:53,535 --> 01:14:55,412
- Do you trust this president?
- Yes, I do.

1316
01:14:57,539 --> 01:15:00,459
<i>Britney Spears was not alone.</i>

1317
01:15:00,626 --> 01:15:04,630
<i>The majority of American people trusted
<i>the president, and why shouldn't they?

1318
01:15:05,964 --> 01:15:10,052
<i>He had spent the better part of last year
<i>giving them every reason why

1319
01:15:10,219 --> 01:15:12,012
<i>we should invade Iraq.</i>

1320
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:17,434
Saddam Hussein has gone
to elaborate lengths, spent enormous sums,

1321
01:15:17,601 --> 01:15:21,897
taken great risks to build
and keep weapons of mass destruction.

1322
01:15:22,064 --> 01:15:26,109
Saddam Hussein is determined
to get his hands on a nuclear bomb

1323
01:15:26,276 --> 01:15:28,654
"Nucular" weapon.

1324
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:31,657
<i>Active chemical munitions bunkers,</i>

1325
01:15:31,823 --> 01:15:33,534
mobile production facilities.

1326
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,577
We know he's got chemical weapons.

1327
01:15:35,744 --> 01:15:37,746
He's got them!

1328
01:15:38,205 --> 01:15:40,123
<i>Huh, that's weird,</i>

1329
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:43,669
<i>because that's not what Bush's people
<i>said when he first took office.

1330
01:15:43,836 --> 01:15:47,005
He has not developed
any significant capability

1331
01:15:47,172 --> 01:15:48,924
with respect to weapons of mass
destruction.

1332
01:15:49,091 --> 01:15:52,553
He is unable to project
conventional power against his neighbors.

1333
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:57,391
We are able to keep arms from him.
His military forces have not been rebuilt.

1334
01:15:57,558 --> 01:16:00,519
Saddam Hussein aids
and protects terrorists

1335
01:16:01,728 --> 01:16:03,856
including members of Al-Qaeda.

1336
01:16:04,022 --> 01:16:07,025
There was a relationship
between Iraq and Al-Qaeda.

1337
01:16:07,192 --> 01:16:09,528
Saddam! Al-Qaeda!

1338
01:16:09,695 --> 01:16:11,196
Saddam! Al-Qaeda!

1339
01:16:11,363 --> 01:16:13,115
Saddam! Saddam! Al-Qaeda!

1340
01:16:13,282 --> 01:16:14,575
It is only a matter of time

1341
01:16:14,741 --> 01:16:18,078
before terrorist states armed
with weapons of mass destruction

1342
01:16:18,245 --> 01:16:21,582
develop the capability to deliver
those weapons to U.S. cities.

1343
01:16:21,748 --> 01:16:25,878
What we are giving you are facts and
conclusions based on solid intelligence.

1344
01:16:29,715 --> 01:16:31,216
The man who hates America.

1345
01:16:31,383 --> 01:16:34,261
This is a man who cannot stand
what we stand for.

1346
01:16:34,428 --> 01:16:37,848
His willingness to terrorize himself!

1347
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:41,351
He hates the fact, like Al-Qaeda does,
that we love freedom.

1348
01:16:41,518 --> 01:16:44,438
After all, this is the guy that tried
to kill my dad at one time.

1349
01:16:44,605 --> 01:16:47,691
They simply got people to believe

1350
01:16:47,858 --> 01:16:51,236
that there was a real threat out there,
when in fact, there wasn't one.

1351
01:16:51,403 --> 01:16:54,072
You get told things every day
that don't happen,

1352
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:55,824
it doesn't seem to bother people.

1353
01:16:55,991 --> 01:16:58,160
<i>Of course, the Democrats were there</i>

1354

Interesting!

1504
01:25:32,257 --> 01:25:34,259
<i>My mother used to tell me
<i>all the time that:

1505
01:25:34,426 --> 01:25:36,678
<i>"Why do you always go for the underdog?"</i>

1506
01:25:36,845 --> 01:25:39,139
<i>It was because the underdog is
<i>who needed me.

1507
01:25:39,306 --> 01:25:42,601
<i>People that don't have anything,
<i>that's who I have to fight for.

1508
01:25:42,768 --> 01:25:44,895
<i>And that's who I have fought for
<i>my entire life.

1509
01:25:45,437 --> 01:25:48,273
I started taking my children,
and telling my children:

1510
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:51,777
"The military is a good option,
I can't afford to have you go to college,

1511
01:25:51,944 --> 01:25:54,571
I cannot pay your way.
Financial aid will not help you."

1512
01:25:54,738 --> 01:25:57,407
So, I, as a mother,
started teaching my children

1513
01:25:57,574 --> 01:25:59,785
about the options
that the military could do.

1514
01:25:59,952 --> 01:26:02,955
That would take them around the world,
they would see all the things that I,

1515
01:26:03,121 --> 01:26:05,958
as a mother, could not let them see,
it would pay for their education

1516
01:26:06,124 --> 01:26:09,002
that I, as their mother,
and their father, could not pay for.

1517
01:26:09,419 --> 01:26:11,922
The military's
a good option for kids in Flint?

1518
01:26:12,089 --> 01:26:14,842
Military's an excellent option
for the people in the city of Flint.

1519
01:26:16,677 --> 01:26:20,055
How many have a friend
or a family member in the service?

1520
01:26:21,932 --> 01:26:24,351
Anybody currently serving overseas?

1521
01:26:24,518 --> 01:26:26,311
- Brother of mine.
- My cousin.

1522
01:26:26,478 --> 01:26:27,729
Yeah, a cousin.

1523
01:26:27,896 --> 01:26:29,773
- Where is your brother?
- Iraq.

1524
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:31,233
Germany!

1525
01:26:31,942 --> 01:26:35,612
My cousin got shipped off to Iraq,
like, three days ago.

1526
01:26:36,321 --> 01:26:37,447
Alright!

1527
01:26:37,865 --> 01:26:41,118
There's, like, an army
or Navy recruiter or Marines recruiter

1528
01:26:41,285 --> 01:26:43,328
up there almost every week.

1529
01:26:44,037 --> 01:26:48,166
He's in the lunch room
recruiting students from the lunch room!

1530
01:26:49,001 --> 01:26:51,336
<i>There are people with a calling.</i>

1531
01:26:56,133 --> 01:26:57,759
<i>Most serve one weekend a month</i>

1532
01:26:57,926 --> 01:26:59,761
<i>and two weeks a year.</i>

1533
01:27:01,847 --> 01:27:03,432
<i>Earning money for college.</i>

1534
01:27:07,394 --> 01:27:09,229
<i>Protecting their community.</i>

1535
01:27:10,981 --> 01:27:14,610
<i>In the Army National Guard, you can!</i>

1536
01:27:18,113 --> 01:27:19,615
I'm going into the Air Force myself.

1537
01:27:19,781 --> 01:27:22,784
I'm going to take a year off,
probably after high school,

1538
01:27:22,951 --> 01:27:26,246
and then make a career, I want to be
an aircraft maintenance technician.

1539
01:27:26,413 --> 01:27:29,583
I ran into a recruiter and, uh,
there was something I noticed about it,

1540
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:32,294
and this is kinda on another...
I noticed it was odd.

1541
01:27:32,461 --> 01:27:35,005
It was more like he was hiring me
for a job than recruiting me for the Army.

1542
01:27:35,172 --> 01:27:36,423
It was the way he approached me,

1543
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:37,758
<i>he approached a friend of mine.</i>

1544
01:27:37,925 --> 01:27:40,093
<i>I was in Borders Books and Music,
<i>he just came up,

1545
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:41,553
he handed us a business card.

1546
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:43,639
They have business cards
made for the Army.

1547
01:27:49,228 --> 01:27:51,688
<i>Meet Marine Staff Sergeant Dale Kortman</i>

1548
01:27:51,855 --> 01:27:53,774
<i>and Sergeant Raymond Plouhar.</i>

1549
01:27:55,108 --> 01:27:58,445
<i>They are two of the many recruiters
<i>assigned to Flint, Michigan.

1550
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:01,615
<i>They're very busy these days.</i>

1551
01:28:01,782 --> 01:28:03,784
Look it, he's running away already.

1552
01:28:03,951 --> 01:28:05,285
He's seen us coming.

1553
01:28:05,452 --> 01:28:06,703
Yeah!

1554
01:28:07,329 --> 01:28:09,790
What we got here?
It's like a little gangster!

1555
01:28:09,957 --> 01:28:11,208
Yeah!

1556
01:28:11,959 --> 01:28:14,044
We're heading over
to the Courtland mall right now.

1557
01:28:15,963 --> 01:28:19,132
<i>They decided not to go
<i>to the wealthier Genesee Valley mall

1558
01:28:19,299 --> 01:28:23,345
<i>in the suburbs, they have a hard time
<i>recruiting young people there.

1559
01:28:23,512 --> 01:28:26,515
<i>Instead, they went to the other mall.</i>

1560
01:28:26,849 --> 01:28:28,809
Let's go in through Mervyns.

1561
01:28:28,976 --> 01:28:30,811
- In through Mervyns?
- And then, we'll walk--

1562
01:28:30,978 --> 01:28:33,355
- Straight down.
- Straight back and to the lunch room or--

1563
01:28:33,897 --> 01:28:35,983
Gents,
you know we're looking at you, right?

1564
01:28:36,149 --> 01:28:37,568
You guys ever think about joining up?

1565
01:28:37,734 --> 01:28:40,028
I thought about going to college
and playing basketball.

1566
01:28:40,195 --> 01:28:41,280
Okay, you any good?

1567
01:28:41,446 --> 01:28:42,447
- Yeah.
- Alright!

1568
01:28:42,614 --> 01:28:44,533
- Especially basketball.
- Good! You can play ball

1569
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:46,785
for the Marine corps,
you know, travel around the world,

1570
01:28:46,952 --> 01:28:48,453
get on the Marine Corps basketball team.

1571
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:50,372
David Robinson was
in the military as well.

1572
01:28:50,539 --> 01:28:52,749
- Oh, was he?
- So, yeah, you can definitely hook it up.

1573
01:28:52,916 --> 01:28:55,210
Right now there is somebody
out there who wants to be a Marine,

1574
01:28:55,377 --> 01:28:56,420
but has no idea how to do it.

1575
01:28:56,587 --> 01:28:59,047
- Where you work at?
- I work at KFC.

1576
01:28:59,214 --> 01:29:00,340
- Sweet!
- On Dort and Lapeer.

1577
01:29:00,507 --> 01:29:02,092
- You can hook us up with some deals!
- Yes!

1578
01:29:02,259 --> 01:29:03,427
They wait to get recruited.

1579
01:29:03,594 --> 01:29:06,471
I don't know, I was probably gonna start
to get a little career in music.

1580
01:29:06,638 --> 01:29:07,556
Career in music?

1581
01:29:07,723 --> 01:29:11,268
Maybe we can get you a career in music,
you know, let the Marines go for it.

1582
01:29:11,435 --> 01:29:12,853
I'm sure you know who Shaggy is, right?

1583
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:14,980
- <i>Yeah!
<i>- You know anything about him?</i></i>

1584
01:29:15,147 --> 01:29:17,191
- <i>Yeah, he Jamaican or something.
<i>- Yeah!</i></i>

1585
01:29:17,357 --> 01:29:18,901
How about a former Marine?

1586
01:29:19,985 --> 01:29:21,111
- Huh!
- Did you know it?

1587
01:29:21,278 --> 01:29:23,614
You need to know discipline
if you're gonna get into music.

1588
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:25,741
- Yeah, I--
- Especially discipline with the money.

1589
01:29:25,908 --> 01:29:27,492
- Right.
- When you make a million, you need

1590
01:29:27,659 --> 01:29:29,119
to manage that money,
so come in the office,

1591
01:29:29,286 --> 01:29:30,287
we can sit down and talk,

1592
01:29:30,454 --> 01:29:33,373
show you everything we know
about the Marines. Sound like a plan?

1593
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:35,751
What do you got going on this afternoon?
How about tomorrow?

1594
01:29:35,918 --> 01:29:37,920
We say around ten o'clock Monday morning?

1595
01:29:38,086 --> 01:29:39,546
- Yeah, that sounds pretty good.
- OK.

1596
01:29:39,713 --> 01:29:40,797
You want me to come pick you up?

1597
01:29:40,964 --> 01:29:42,591
Better to get them
when they're ones and twos.

1598
01:29:42,758 --> 01:29:45,427
- Hey, pal!
- And work on them that way.

1599
01:29:45,594 --> 01:29:46,803
Ladies, you're ready to join up?

1600
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:49,056
Green hat behind us.

1601
01:29:49,223 --> 01:29:52,851
- Looks young. He's young.
- Yeah!

1602
01:29:53,018 --> 01:29:54,686
- Yeah.
- We got two over here.

1603
01:29:54,853 --> 01:29:57,314
- Yeah.
- Right over by the red van.

1604
01:29:57,481 --> 01:29:59,608
You go that way,
I go this way, we corner him.

1605
01:29:59,775 --> 01:30:01,610
- You're in the ninth grade?
- Yes, sir!

1606
01:30:01,777 --> 01:30:04,446
Man, you look older than ninth grade!

1607
01:30:04,613 --> 01:30:06,615
- Yes, sir!
- Alright, here's my card!

1608
01:30:06,782 --> 01:30:08,909
You ever thought about being a Marine,
man?

1609
01:30:09,076 --> 01:30:11,453
I thought about it,
I got a wife and kid now, so...

1610
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:13,080
Even more reason to join now.

1611
01:30:13,247 --> 01:30:15,207
- What I want to do, man, real quick, is...
- Yes, sir!

1612
01:30:15,374 --> 01:30:18,001
Just get some information from you,
so I can scratch you off my list

1613
01:30:18,168 --> 01:30:20,379
saying I've talked to you,
and you know, you're not interested.

1614
01:30:20,546 --> 01:30:21,505
- Is that cool?
- Yeah!

1615
01:30:21,672 --> 01:30:22,714
Alright. What's your name?

1616
01:30:22,881 --> 01:30:24,466
Your phone number?
Your address, Mario?

1617
01:30:24,633 --> 01:30:26,176
Add another one to the list.

1618
01:30:27,386 --> 01:30:30,806
However, one would love to have
that chance to experience college life

1619
01:30:30,973 --> 01:30:33,517
you know, stuff young people can do
without having the risk

1620
01:30:33,684 --> 01:30:37,062
of dying in the process,
I guess I can say candidly.

1621
01:30:39,898 --> 01:30:41,692
<i>The holidays do add a little bit more...</i>

1622
01:30:41,859 --> 01:30:43,986
friction as opposed to just another night.

1623
01:30:44,152 --> 01:30:46,572
We want to give our guys

1624
01:30:46,738 --> 01:30:48,782
a little bit of time off,
a little bit of time to relax,

1625
01:30:48,949 --> 01:30:52,619
however, we are in a combat zone,
my soldiers do recognize that fact.

1626
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:56,081
Everybody's a little bit
nervous about it, I guess, but...

1627
01:30:56,248 --> 01:30:58,959
We're professionals,
we're going to take care of you.

1628
01:31:00,502 --> 01:31:01,670
I promise!

1629
01:31:03,755 --> 01:31:07,050
Every house here
has the right to have weapons.

1630

01:32:29,508 --> 01:32:31,510
Is he in the house? Is he in the house?

1652
01:32:31,677 --> 01:32:33,262
Man, Passerelli!

1653
01:32:33,428 --> 01:32:35,097
- Is he in the house?
- Passerelli!

1654
01:32:35,264 --> 01:32:37,432
He is! He is in the house. Where?

1655
01:32:37,599 --> 01:32:39,685
- This is it?
- Get on the second floor!

1656
01:32:39,852 --> 01:32:41,478
- Watch out, watch out!
- Go, go, go!

1657
01:32:41,645 --> 01:32:42,896
Watch out, Adele, watch out!

1658
01:32:43,063 --> 01:32:44,398
One coming up!

1659
01:32:47,401 --> 01:32:49,444
That's Suheib Al Douri. Suheib Al Douri?

1660
01:32:51,071 --> 01:32:53,407
- What's your name?
- Suheib, Suheib.

1661
01:32:55,534 --> 01:32:57,119
- This is Suheib?
- Yeah!

1662
01:33:00,122 --> 01:33:03,584
What has he done? He's just a student!

1663
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:06,253
Tell them to calm down!
Tell them to calm down.

1664
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:07,880
Alright, going to the roof!

1665
01:33:08,046 --> 01:33:09,298
You will not be harmed!

1666
01:33:13,010 --> 01:33:15,262
We appreciate your conversation.
This is the target!

1667
01:33:15,429 --> 01:33:16,763
So he's about to bring him out!

1668
01:33:16,930 --> 01:33:18,599
Alright, move, go!

1669
01:33:18,765 --> 01:33:20,434
<i>As you go back to the old saying:</i>

1670
01:33:20,601 --> 01:33:22,311
"Win the hearts and minds of the people."

1671
01:33:22,477 --> 01:33:26,773
That's our job.
We have to bring the...

1672
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:30,319
the ideal of democracy
and freedom to the country

1673
01:33:30,485 --> 01:33:33,989
and show them that the American people
are not here to rule Iraq.

1674
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:40,454
Don't be afraid.
He's not going to hit you.

1675
01:33:41,205 --> 01:33:42,414
What did he do?

1676
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:46,835
Why don't you tell us?
God keep you, what did he do?

1677
01:33:48,378 --> 01:33:50,631
Hey! Tell them to be quiet.

1678
01:33:53,467 --> 01:33:56,428
I start doing evidence turn in,
that process takes about three hours, so,

1679
01:33:57,554 --> 01:34:01,683
that's going to be it for the night
and that concludes Christmas Eve.

1680
01:34:05,729 --> 01:34:08,982
Merry Christmas, PRT, Merry Christmas!
Santa came to Iraq just for you guys.

1681
01:34:09,149 --> 01:34:11,318
Trying to keep
the skies clear for you, Santa.

1682
01:34:14,196 --> 01:34:16,240
<i>You consider yourself a proud American?</i>

1683
01:34:16,406 --> 01:34:18,867
<i>Absolutely.
<i>I'm an extremely proud American.

1684
01:34:19,034 --> 01:34:22,204
<i>I think I'm probably more proud
<i>than the average Joe.

1685
01:34:22,371 --> 01:34:26,083
<i>When I put my flag out,
<i>I can't allow it to touch the ground

1686
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:29,795
<i>because I know the lives that were lost
<i>and the blood that was shed,

1687
01:34:29,962 --> 01:34:31,672
<i>so that I could be here and have a flag.</i>

1688
01:34:31,839 --> 01:34:34,550
- <i>How often do you put it out?
- <i>Every single day.</i></i>

1689
01:34:34,716 --> 01:34:38,804
<i>Every single day! I started
<i>when my daughter was in Desert Storm.

1690
01:34:38,971 --> 01:34:44,017
<i>I had the same flag flying on my front
<i>porch and the same yellow ribbons,

1691
01:34:44,184 --> 01:34:47,312
<i>praying and hoping every single day
<i>that my child would come home safe,

1692
01:34:47,479 --> 01:34:49,398
<i>and that everybody's child
<i>would come home safe.

1693
01:34:49,565 --> 01:34:51,066
<i>- And she did?
<i>- And she did!

1694
01:34:51,233 --> 01:34:53,569
Do you have other family members
that have been in the military?

1695
01:34:53,735 --> 01:34:58,824
Absolutely.
Uncles, aunts, cousins, brothers, father.

1696
01:34:58,991 --> 01:35:00,784
- Very strong military family.
- Very strong!

1697
01:35:00,951 --> 01:35:02,202
My family was...

1698
01:35:02,369 --> 01:35:06,123
My family is what I consider
part of the backbone of America.

1699
01:35:06,415 --> 01:35:08,625
It's families like mine,
and it's not just my family,

1700
01:35:08,792 --> 01:35:11,628
there's hundreds of families,
millions of families out here,

1701
01:35:11,795 --> 01:35:14,089
that this country
was founded on their backs.

1702
01:35:14,256 --> 01:35:17,176
I have been known to be
a conservative Democrat.

1703
01:35:17,342 --> 01:35:19,845
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's what you consider yourself, yeah?

1704
01:35:20,012 --> 01:35:22,681
- Yeah, it's a great country.
- It's a great country!

1705
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:26,852
The cross that I choose to wear,
if you notice, it's a multicultural,

1706
01:35:27,019 --> 01:35:28,645
a multicolored cross,

1707
01:35:28,812 --> 01:35:31,982
that's because I believe that all
God's people come in many colors.

1708
01:35:32,149 --> 01:35:34,276
And my family itself is multicultural.

1709
01:35:34,443 --> 01:35:38,155
<i>You have a daughter
<i>who went into the military.

1710
01:35:38,322 --> 01:35:40,657
And your first born son,
uh, in the military!

1711
01:35:40,824 --> 01:35:44,369
That's, uh, you know,
that's quite a gift to the country.

1712
01:35:44,536 --> 01:35:46,205
- Exactly.
- From your family!

1713
01:35:46,371 --> 01:35:49,041
<i>So, having a son in the Army,
<i>pretty proud thing.

1714
01:35:49,208 --> 01:35:52,252
<i>Oh, you know what? He made it!</i>

1715
01:35:52,961 --> 01:35:55,172
What was your reaction to protestors

1716
01:35:55,339 --> 01:35:58,091
during, say, the Gulf War or Vietnam?

1717
01:35:58,258 --> 01:36:01,261
I always hated the protestors.
I always hated the protestors.

1718
01:36:01,428 --> 01:36:03,472
It was just a slap in my face.

1719
01:36:03,972 --> 01:36:05,349
It was just like...

1720
01:36:05,766 --> 01:36:07,809
<i>They were dishonoring my son.</i>

1721
01:36:07,976 --> 01:36:10,145
<i>And I burned in my soul</i>

1722
01:36:10,312 --> 01:36:12,147
<i>"You don't understand.</i>

1723
01:36:12,314 --> 01:36:14,024
<i>They're not there
<i>because they wanna be there."

1724
01:36:14,191 --> 01:36:15,943
But then I came to understand

1725
01:36:16,109 --> 01:36:18,987
that they weren't protesting the men
and the women that were there,

1726
01:36:19,154 --> 01:36:21,865
they were protesting
the concept of the war.

1727
01:36:22,324 --> 01:36:24,910
I know I'm a soldier
and I'm here to do a job and,

1728
01:36:26,119 --> 01:36:28,247
I've been a soldier for a while.

1729
01:36:30,082 --> 01:36:35,212
Once you have to go and do your job
and you see the things that you see...

1730
01:36:37,422 --> 01:36:40,175
I was saying that
there's some disillusionment in that.

1731
01:36:40,342 --> 01:36:42,928
Battalion commander fully expects us

1732
01:36:43,095 --> 01:36:49,560
to be attacked in some type of way
before we get there.

1733
01:36:51,228 --> 01:36:54,106
I know that so far it's been pretty calm,

1734
01:36:54,273 --> 01:36:55,566
not much has happened,

1735
01:36:55,732 --> 01:37:00,028
but, be aware that it can
and it probably will.

1736
01:37:04,908 --> 01:37:07,828
They're beginning to organize themselves,
just in neighborhoods.

1737
01:37:07,995 --> 01:37:11,582
The kids get together a lot,
well, can't say "kids", but, uh...

1738
01:37:11,748 --> 01:37:15,586
guys about 17, 18, starting to come
together and they hate us.

1739
01:37:15,752 --> 01:37:17,421
Just why? I'm not really sure.

1740
01:37:20,465 --> 01:37:23,760
<i>Immoral behavior breeds immoral behavior.</i>

1741
01:37:25,179 --> 01:37:27,598
<i>When a president commits the immoral act</i>

1742
01:37:27,764 --> 01:37:31,560
<i>of sending otherwise good kids to war,
<i>based on a lie,

1743
01:37:32,186 --> 01:37:33,812
<i>this is what you get.</i>

1744
01:37:33,979 --> 01:37:35,856
Hey, are you ticklish?

1745
01:37:41,778 --> 01:37:43,864
<i>Ali Baba still has a hard-on!</i>

1746
01:37:46,867 --> 01:37:49,328
Don't tell me!
Why are you touching someone else's?

1747
01:37:51,079 --> 01:37:52,206
He touched his dick!

1748
01:37:58,754 --> 01:38:01,965
To have these people shoot at us,
kill us, blow us up,

1749
01:38:02,132 --> 01:38:06,053
whatever means they can,
and I don't understand it,

1750
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:10,474
we're trying to help these people
and it seems they don't want our help.

1751
01:38:10,641 --> 01:38:13,018
"Get out of here", but the minute
something goes wrong with them,

1752
01:38:13,185 --> 01:38:15,020
"Oh, why weren't you here?
Why didn't you do this?"

1753
01:38:15,187 --> 01:38:17,689
You know, it's...
I hate this country.

1754
01:38:18,815 --> 01:38:20,192
You know, you, you...

1755
01:38:20,359 --> 01:38:27,366
I feel that a part of your soul...
is destroyed in taking another life.

1756
01:38:28,617 --> 01:38:31,370
And, yes, that statement is very true,
you...

1757
01:38:32,454 --> 01:38:35,249
cannot kill someone
without killing a part of yourself.

1758
01:38:36,208 --> 01:38:38,418
If you get called up,
would you go back to Iraq?

1759
01:38:38,585 --> 01:38:39,670
No.

1760
01:38:39,837 --> 01:38:41,129
- You're not?
- No!

1761
01:38:41,588 --> 01:38:44,925
What repercussions
do you face, if you don't?

1762
01:38:45,092 --> 01:38:48,262
It's possible jail time,
that's one possibility.

1763
01:38:48,428 --> 01:38:49,555
Are you willing to risk that?

1764
01:38:49,721 --> 01:38:52,140
Yes. Yes, I...

1765
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:55,769
I will not let my person...

1766
01:38:58,188 --> 01:39:00,899
I will not let anyone

1767
01:39:01,567 --> 01:39:04,987
send me back over there
to kill other poor people.

1768
01:39:05,153 --> 01:39:10,117
Especially when they pose no threat
to me and my country.

1769
01:39:14,955 --> 01:39:16,206
I won't do it.

1770
01:39:17,583 --> 01:39:21,545
The haves, and the have-mores.

1771
01:39:24,673 --> 01:39:26,717
Some people call you the elite.

1772
01:39:27,134 --> 01:39:28,385
I call you my base.

1773
01:39:37,144 --> 01:39:39,688
<i>While Bush
<i>was busy taking care of his base

1774
01:39:39,855 --> 01:39:42,024
<i>and professing his love for our troops,</i>

1775
01:39:42,191 --> 01:39:45,527
<i>he proposed cutting
<i>combat soldiers' pay by 33 %.

1776
01:39:46,862 --> 01:39:49,239
<i>And assistance to their families by 60 %.</i>

1777
01:39:50,032 --> 01:39:52,618
<i>He opposed giving veterans
<i>a billion dollars more

1778
01:39:52,784 --> 01:39:54,161
<i>in healthcare benefits.</i>

1779
01:39:54,912 --> 01:39:57,623
<i>And he supported
<i>closing veteran hospitals.

1780
01:39:58,081 --> 01:40:00,792
<i>He tried to double
<i>the prescription drug costs for veterans

1781
01:40:01,668 --> 01:40:04,713
<i>and opposed full benefits
<i>for part-time reservists.

1782
01:40:06,673 --> 01:40:11,261
<i>And when staff Sergeant Brett Petriken
<i>from Flint was killed in Iraq on May 26,

1783
01:40:11,428 --> 01:40:14,014
<i>the Army sent
<i>his last paycheck to his family,

1784
01:40:14,181 --> 01:40:17,809
<i>but they docked him for the last five days
<i>of the month that he didn't work

1785
01:40:17,976 --> 01:40:19,353
<i>because he was dead.</i>

1786
01:40:21,438 --> 01:40:24,525
They say they're not going to leave
any veteran behind, but they're leaving

1787
01:40:24,691 --> 01:40:27,027
<i>all kinds of veterans behind.</i>

1788
01:40:27,194 --> 01:40:30,822
To say that we're forgotten, no,
I know we're not forgotten, but missed?

1789
01:40:30,989 --> 01:40:34,493
Yes. Yes. You know, there are
a lot of soldiers that have been missed,

1790
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:36,203
that have been skipped over,

1791
01:40:36,370 --> 01:40:38,914
that didn't get the proper coverage
that they deserved.

1792
01:40:39,081 --> 01:40:42,125
They have a death toll, but they're not
showing the amount of people

1793
01:40:42,292 --> 01:40:44,837
that have been injured or are amputated
because of their injuries, you know.

1794
01:40:45,587 --> 01:40:47,965
- Like, I still feel like I have hands.
- Yeah!

1795
01:40:48,131 --> 01:40:52,469
And the pain is like,
my hands are being crushed in a vice.

1796
01:40:52,636 --> 01:40:56,431
But they do a lot to help it,
and they take a lot of the edge off it,

1797
01:40:56,598 --> 01:40:59,351
and it makes it
a lot more tolerable and...

1798
01:40:59,977 --> 01:41:02,646
<i>I was injured in late April,
<i>on patrol in Baghdad.

1799
01:41:03,564 --> 01:41:06,817
Um...
a couple of guys came out.

1800
01:41:07,568 --> 01:41:09,152
Ambushed us.

1801
01:41:09,319 --> 01:41:13,866
I've got nerve damage and stuff like that,
and I've got a lot of pain,

1802
01:41:14,032 --> 01:41:15,784
I'm constantly in pain.

1803
01:41:16,451 --> 01:41:21,999
Um, I take a lot of morphine
to help with that stuff.

1804
01:41:23,458 --> 01:41:27,421
I'm doing... you know, just readjusting,

1805
01:41:27,588 --> 01:41:31,133
getting life back on track.

1806
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:32,801
You know what I'm saying?

1807
01:41:32,968 --> 01:41:37,055
Yes. I'm not gonna do
what it is that I did before.

1808
01:41:37,639 --> 01:41:41,435
Um, I... I was a Republican
for quite a few years.

1809
01:41:41,602 --> 01:41:43,270
And, um...

1810
01:41:44,229 --> 01:41:46,690
For some reason, they...

1811
01:41:49,818 --> 01:41:52,362
They conduct business
in a very dishonest way.

1812
01:41:52,529 --> 01:41:53,822
I'm gonna be incredibly active

1813
01:41:53,989 --> 01:41:57,576
in the Democratic party
down where I live once I get out.

1814
01:41:57,743 --> 01:42:03,457
So, I'm gonna definitely do my best
to ensure that the Democrats win control.

1815
01:42:04,291 --> 01:42:07,961
Iraq, Baghdad, I didn't know
anything of those things.

1816
01:42:09,505 --> 01:42:12,758
And we were in the hallway
in the upstairs of our house,

1817
01:42:12,925 --> 01:42:15,177
<i>and he was crying,</i>

1818
01:42:15,344 --> 01:42:20,432
<i>he said that he was really scared
<i>and he didn't want to have to go to Iraq.

1819
01:42:20,599 --> 01:42:24,144
We were able to have a whole conversation
about sometimes some fear is healthy,

1820
01:42:24,311 --> 01:42:26,230
because it keeps our senses about us.

1821
01:42:26,396 --> 01:42:29,483
<i>And that's when he told me that
<i>he had not told anybody else but he knew

1822
01:42:29,650 --> 01:42:31,109
<i>he was going to Baghdad.</i>

1823
01:42:31,276 --> 01:42:33,237
Wow!

1824
01:42:33,779 --> 01:42:37,324
As everybody,
we were glued to the TV.

1825
01:42:37,783 --> 01:42:41,245
Just glued, completely glued
to the television,

1826
01:42:41,411 --> 01:42:42,829
in hopes of seeing a glimpse of him.

1827
01:42:42,996 --> 01:42:45,082
"Can't you please go
to where the helicopters are,

1828
01:42:45,249 --> 01:42:47,459
can't you please let us see him?"

1829
01:42:47,626 --> 01:42:50,295
Then, that night,
it was about ten something,

1830
01:42:50,462 --> 01:42:52,840
I went upstairs to the bedroom,

1831
01:42:53,006 --> 01:42:56,677
I was lying in bed and I was flipping
the channels, all I heard was:

1832
01:42:56,844 --> 01:42:59,221
"Black Hawk down, South Central Iraq."

1833
01:42:59,638 --> 01:43:03,851
<i>All I can tell you at this hour is that
<i>last night the Army did indeed lose

1834
01:43:04,017 --> 01:43:05,978
<i>a Black Hawk helicopter.</i>

1835
01:43:06,144 --> 01:43:08,480
<i>We are being told
<i>by officers on the ground

1836
01:43:08,647 --> 01:43:11,358
<i>that there were six occupants
<i>inside the Black Hawk.

1837
01:43:11,525 --> 01:43:14,027
The next morning,
I got up and I said:

1838
01:43:14,194 --> 01:43:16,154
"You push those thoughts
out of your mind!

1839
01:43:16,321 --> 01:43:18,240
OK Jesus, I need you to come in,

1840
01:43:18,407 --> 01:43:20,367
I need you Jesus,
you gotta help me through this!"

1841
01:43:20,951 --> 01:43:22,202
The army called me,

1842
01:43:22,369 --> 01:43:26,874
I remember getting on the phone
and him asking me if I was Lila Lipscomb.

1843
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:30,419
"Mother of Sergeant Michael Pedersen?"

1844
01:43:32,588 --> 01:43:34,965
And I remember dropping the telephone.

1845
01:43:38,802 --> 01:43:41,763
And all I can honestly say
that I remember is:

1846
01:43:41,930 --> 01:43:42,848
"Ma'am!

1847
01:43:43,015 --> 01:43:48,020
The United States Army, the Secretary
of Defense regretfully informs you..."

1848
01:43:50,606 --> 01:43:51,523
That's all I know.

1849
01:43:53,942 --> 01:43:57,237
The grief grabbed me so hard

1850
01:43:57,905 --> 01:44:00,449
that I literally fell on the floor.

1851
01:44:00,616 --> 01:44:03,619
And I was alone,
I didn't have anybody to pick me up.

1852
01:44:04,119 --> 01:44:07,664
So I literally crawled over to my desk,

1853
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:11,585
and was hanging on,
and I remember screaming:

1854
01:44:12,127 --> 01:44:16,215
"Why does it have to be Michael?
Why did you have to take my son?

1855
01:44:16,715 --> 01:44:21,386
Why is it my son that you had to take?
He didn't do anything!

1856
01:44:21,845 --> 01:44:26,725
He wasn't a bad guy, he was a good guy,
why did you have to take my son?"

1857
01:44:26,892 --> 01:44:28,727
Uh, I, erm...

1858
01:44:31,063 --> 01:44:33,899
I can't imagine what it must be like
to lose a son or a daughter,

1859
01:44:34,066 --> 01:44:38,487
or a husband or a wife,
and I... it pains me.

1860
01:44:40,906 --> 01:44:42,533
You have his last letter?

1861
01:44:43,116 --> 01:44:44,826
And it was mailed March 16th

1862
01:44:45,619 --> 01:44:48,956
but I didn't get it until
about a week before he was killed.

1863
01:44:50,207 --> 01:44:55,254
"Hello. Hey mama, well,
sorry I haven't been able to call,

1864
01:44:55,420 --> 01:44:59,800
they took the phones seven days ago,
I got the letter and box,

1865
01:44:59,967 --> 01:45:03,095
that is so cool,
your first grandson came...

1866
01:45:05,222 --> 01:45:07,850
...the same day your oldest son did.

1867
01:45:08,016 --> 01:45:10,394
How is everyone? I'm doing fine.

1868
01:45:10,561 --> 01:45:14,731
We are just out here in the sand
and windstorms, waiting.

1869
01:45:14,898 --> 01:45:20,654
What in the world is wrong with George
'trying to be like his dad' Bush?

1870
01:45:20,821 --> 01:45:23,699
He got us out here for nothing whatsoever.

1871
01:45:23,866 --> 01:45:26,660
I am so furious right now, Mama.

1872
01:45:27,870 --> 01:45:32,541
I really hope they do not
re-elect that fool, honestly.

1873
01:45:33,208 --> 01:45:36,003
I am in good spirits and I am doing OK.

1874
01:45:36,170 --> 01:45:37,880
I really miss you guys.

1875
01:45:38,046 --> 01:45:39,173
Thanks for the Bible...

1876
01:45:41,758 --> 01:45:44,261
...and books, and candy.

1877
01:45:44,428 --> 01:45:47,264
I really look forward
to letters from you guys.

1878
01:45:48,849 --> 01:45:50,767
Well, tell all the family hello

1879
01:45:51,393 --> 01:45:53,145
and that I am doing fine.

1880
01:45:53,312 --> 01:45:56,732
We don't expect
anything to happen any time soon.

1881
01:45:56,899 --> 01:46:00,777
I cannot wait to get home
and get back to my life.

1882
01:46:01,278 --> 01:46:03,155
Tell Sputnik congrats.

1883
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:06,617
And I'll see my first nephew soon,

1884
01:46:07,993 --> 01:46:10,078
as soon as I get back to the States.

1885
01:46:10,746 --> 01:46:13,040
Hope you guys are doing OK

1886
01:46:13,207 --> 01:46:15,167
and keep sending the mail.

1887
01:46:15,334 --> 01:46:18,045
It makes getting through the days easier.

1888
01:46:21,298 --> 01:46:27,095
Well, I am on my way to bed,
so I will write you guys soon.

1889
01:46:28,180 --> 01:46:31,475
I love and miss all of you guys."

1890
01:46:33,185 --> 01:46:35,145
"Love, Michael."

1891
01:46:44,988 --> 01:46:46,823
I want him to be alive,

1892
01:46:47,533 --> 01:46:49,576
and I can't make him alive.

1893
01:46:51,245 --> 01:46:53,372
But your flesh just aches.

1894
01:46:54,373 --> 01:46:56,834
You want your child, it's out of sync.

1895
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,838
A parent is not supposed
to bury their child.

1896
01:47:03,757 --> 01:47:07,636
<i>I feel, I... I... I feel sad for my family</i>

1897
01:47:07,803 --> 01:47:10,013
<i>because we lost our son.</i>

1898
01:47:11,557 --> 01:47:12,641
But...

1899
01:47:13,517 --> 01:47:16,645
I really feel sorry
for the other families

1900
01:47:16,812 --> 01:47:21,066
that is losing their kids as we speak.

1901
01:47:24,069 --> 01:47:25,612
And for what?

1902
01:47:25,779 --> 01:47:27,364
I don't...

1903
01:47:29,074 --> 01:47:33,203
That's the, I guess, sickening part.
For what?

1904
01:47:33,954 --> 01:47:35,956
You've heard a lot
about Halliburton lately.

1905
01:47:36,123 --> 01:47:41,086
Criticism is okay. We can take it.
Criticism is not failure.

1906
01:47:41,253 --> 01:47:43,422
Our employees are doing a great job.

1907
01:47:43,589 --> 01:47:46,717
<i>We're feeding the soldiers,
<i>we're rebuilding Iraq.

1908
01:47:46,884 --> 01:47:50,012
Will things go wrong?
Sure they will, it's a war zone.

1909
01:47:50,179 --> 01:47:52,806
We're serving the troops
because of what we know,

1910
01:47:52,973 --> 01:47:54,266
not who we know.

1911
01:47:54,433 --> 01:47:57,519
Well, let me tell you about Halliburton,
the company I ran.

1912
01:47:57,686 --> 01:47:59,521
I'm very proud of what I did
at Halliburton,

1913
01:47:59,688 --> 01:48:02,566
the people of Halliburton are very proud
of what they've accomplished

1914
01:48:02,733 --> 01:48:04,276
and I frankly

1915
01:48:04,776 --> 01:48:08,113
don't feel any need to apologize
for the way I've spent my time

1916
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:11,074
over the last five years
as the C.E.O. and Chairman

1917
01:48:11,241 --> 01:48:12,951
of a major American corporation,
a good one.

1918
01:48:13,118 --> 01:48:16,121
This is also an attempt
to divert attention away from the fact

1919
01:48:16,288 --> 01:48:17,748
they have no energy policy.

1920
01:48:18,916 --> 01:48:22,002
And as the Secretary of Energy said,
we were caught unawares!

1921
01:48:24,463 --> 01:48:26,590
<i>In the middle of the war, Microsoft,</i>

1922
01:48:26,757 --> 01:48:30,052
<i>DHL and other corporations
<i>invited Halliburton

1923
01:48:30,219 --> 01:48:31,720
<i>to a conference</i>

1924
01:48:31,887 --> 01:48:34,765
<i>to figure out how much money
<i>could be made in Iraq.

1925
01:48:36,350 --> 01:48:37,601
<i>Having worked</i>

1926
01:48:37,768 --> 01:48:44,691
this, uh... effort
even since before the invasion,

1927
01:48:44,858 --> 01:48:47,152
the, uh, liberation of Iraq started.

1928
01:48:47,319 --> 01:48:52,157
You, industry, are definitely
a vital part of that effort.

1929
01:48:52,324 --> 01:48:55,410
We appreciate your interest in this.
We need you.

1930
01:48:55,577 --> 01:48:58,455
Now, lots of you are
small businesses and you are struggling.

1931
01:48:58,622 --> 01:49:00,457
How do we get a piece of this big action?

1932
01:49:00,624 --> 01:49:02,876
All of you, the big guys,
are going to get it and the rest of us

1933
01:49:03,043 --> 01:49:05,921
that have subcontracting capability,
or no, none at all.

1934
01:49:06,088 --> 01:49:08,549
U.S.T.V.A. is for you.

1935
01:49:08,715 --> 01:49:10,884
Once that oil start flowing
and money coming,

1936
01:49:11,051 --> 01:49:12,845
it's going to be lots of money,

1937
01:49:13,011 --> 01:49:15,138
it's the second largest oil reserve
in the world.

1938
01:49:15,305 --> 01:49:16,974
There's no question
about how much money is there.

1939
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:21,603
I've been getting complaints
from Iraqi firms and from American firms,

1940
01:49:21,770 --> 01:49:24,690
that the lack of transparency,
the corruption...

1941
01:49:24,857 --> 01:49:27,276
I think the profits
that American companies are making,

1942
01:49:27,442 --> 01:49:29,111
the majors, the main companies,

1943
01:49:29,278 --> 01:49:31,238
are so overwhelming,

1944
01:49:31,405 --> 01:49:34,783
I mean, like when you have a line item
for a million dollars

1945
01:49:34,950 --> 01:49:38,245
and you subcontract it out
for 50 or 60 or 70 thousand dollars,

1946
01:49:38,412 --> 01:49:39,621
that's a huge profit,

1947
01:49:39,788 --> 01:49:41,999
and it's the American taxpayer
that's going to pay for that.

1948
01:49:42,165 --> 01:49:43,876
And it's going to get better!

1949
01:49:44,042 --> 01:49:47,546
Start building relationships
because it's going to get much better

1950
01:49:47,713 --> 01:49:49,631
as the oil flows
and their budget increase.

1951
01:49:49,798 --> 01:49:53,135
The good news is, whatever it costs,
the government will pay you.

1952
01:49:53,635 --> 01:49:56,138
War is always good for certain companies

1953
01:49:56,305 --> 01:49:58,515
that are in the war,
the business of war.

1954
01:50:01,518 --> 01:50:04,479
We're very proud of the work we're doing
in supporting the U.S. government

1955
01:50:04,646 --> 01:50:05,939
and the U.S. military,

1956
01:50:06,106 --> 01:50:08,609
and the real heroes of the campaign,
the real heroes of the reconstruction,

1957
01:50:08,775 --> 01:50:11,653
are the men and women
of the U.S. Armed Forces,

1958
01:50:11,820 --> 01:50:14,239
and we're proud of being any part of that
that we can in supporting them.

1959
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:17,242
<i>Halliburton delivers hot meals, supplies,</i>

1960
01:50:17,784 --> 01:50:21,288
<i>clean clothing
<i>and communications to our soldiers.

1961
01:50:21,455 --> 01:50:25,209
<i>So they can be a little closer to home.</i>

1962
01:50:25,375 --> 01:50:28,462
It's a girl? It's a girl!

1963
01:50:30,005 --> 01:50:31,632
<i>Proud to serve our troops.</i>

1964
01:50:31,798 --> 01:50:35,385
I just read in the paper
how Halliburton got another contract.

1965
01:50:35,552 --> 01:50:38,472
- Halliburton got another contract!
- That's right!

1966
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:41,308
Which is not being...

1967
01:50:42,476 --> 01:50:43,852
contested at all!

1968
01:50:44,019 --> 01:50:45,312
Because nobody knows!

1969
01:50:45,479 --> 01:50:47,814
Well, it's in the papers,
so somebody knows!

1970
01:50:48,148 --> 01:50:52,152
But that's after it happens,
it's after the fact, it's too late.

1971
01:50:53,529 --> 01:50:57,324
<i>The United States is now
<i>a major player in the Iraqi oil business.

1972
01:50:57,491 --> 01:50:59,576
<i>American troops guard the oil fields</i>

1973
01:50:59,743 --> 01:51:02,788

1974
01:51:02,955 --> 01:51:04,957
<i>It's a safe environment to work in.</i>

1975
01:51:05,499 --> 01:51:08,460
We don't feel any risk,
we feel we're being well protected here,

1976
01:51:08,627 --> 01:51:09,628
or we wouldn't be here.

1977
01:51:09,795 --> 01:51:15,551
It's no secret, I mean, I make,
between 2,000 and 3,000 a month.

1978
01:51:15,717 --> 01:51:17,678
A Halliburton employee
out here driving a bus

1979
01:51:17,845 --> 01:51:20,347
can make all between
8,000 and 10,000 a month,

1980
01:51:20,514 --> 01:51:23,308
explain that one to me,
for 40 hours a week,

1981
01:51:23,475 --> 01:51:25,394
driving the same
two and a half mile route.

1982
01:51:25,561 --> 01:51:28,981
Go figure! Where do you...
Where's the justification in that?

1983
01:51:29,147 --> 01:51:32,484
There's no other single area
of the world today

1984
01:51:32,651 --> 01:51:36,238
with the opportunity for business,
new business,

1985
01:51:36,405 --> 01:51:39,324
similar to the opportunity
that's available today in Iraq.

1986
01:51:39,741 --> 01:51:42,077
The president went in and did what he did

1987
01:51:42,244 --> 01:51:44,371
and we're all supporting him
and our troops

1988
01:51:44,538 --> 01:51:49,418
and we wanna make sure
that the efforts and the lost lives and...

1989
01:51:49,585 --> 01:51:51,295
It wasn't for no reason.

1990
01:51:51,461 --> 01:51:53,714
If it wasn't for the oil,
no one would be there.

1991
01:51:53,881 --> 01:51:55,340
Nobody would worry about it.

1992
01:51:55,507 --> 01:51:57,176
Unfortunately,
at least for the near term,

1993
01:51:57,342 --> 01:52:02,639
we think it's going to be a good situation
and a dangerous situation.

1994
01:52:02,806 --> 01:52:05,267
Good for business, bad for the people.

1995
01:52:05,434 --> 01:52:08,937
Today, on the news,
Rumsfeld was saying...

1996
01:52:09,104 --> 01:52:11,773
And Wolf? Wolfowitz!

1997
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:16,904
"Oh, the Iraqi people
are much, much better off.

1998
01:52:17,070 --> 01:52:20,157
Isn't it better
that we got rid of Saddam

1999
01:52:20,324 --> 01:52:24,077
and now the Iraqi people can do
what they want to do

2000
01:52:24,244 --> 01:52:26,079
and really be free?"

2001
01:52:26,496 --> 01:52:29,208
Will they ever be free?
No, they'll not be free.

2002
01:52:29,374 --> 01:52:32,419
And where are the weapons
of mass destruction?

2003
01:52:32,586 --> 01:52:35,380
It was a... We were duped.
We were really duped.

2004
01:52:35,547 --> 01:52:40,511
And these poor people, the young men
and women who are being killed there,

2005
01:52:40,677 --> 01:52:43,096
it's unnecessary.
I... That's it!

2006
01:52:43,263 --> 01:52:44,806
- No more.
- That's a disgrace.

2007
01:52:44,973 --> 01:52:48,769
They died in a just cause
for defending freedom

2008
01:52:48,936 --> 01:52:51,355
and they will not have died in vain.

2009

- My son killed.

2016

- Business to do Iraq now.

all these young Americans.

2020
01:53:38,902 --> 01:53:41,280
- Yes.
- For what? For oil.

2021
01:53:41,446 --> 01:53:43,156
Bush is a terrorist!

2022
01:53:43,323 --> 01:53:45,158
No, he isn't, this is all staged!

2023

- Yes, he's the butcher of Iraq.
- This is staged.

2024

- He was killed in Karbala.

2028

April second, it's not a stage,
my son is dead.

2029
01:54:00,716 --> 01:54:02,968
Well, a lot of other people too.

2030
01:54:07,389 --> 01:54:08,932
Blame Al-Qaeda!

2031

What did that woman yell at you?

2032
01:54:15,230 --> 01:54:17,566
That I'm supposed to blame the Al-Qaeda.

2033
01:54:18,567 --> 01:54:22,946
The Al-Qaeda didn't make a decision
to send my son to Iraq.

2034
01:54:24,198 --> 01:54:26,867
Ignorance that we deal with
with everyday people!

2035

'Cause they don't know.

Hey Michael, how are you doing?
I'm good, John Tanner.

Yeah, nice to meet you,
very nice to meet you.

2053
01:55:54,705 --> 01:55:56,874
- What are you doing?
- Well, I'm here with Cpl. Henderson.

- U.S. Marine Corps.
- Corporal, I was in the Navy years ago.

2055
01:56:00,210 --> 01:56:03,046
- Okay, Sir!
- 1968 to 72.

2056
01:56:03,213 --> 01:56:05,090
We had Marines guarding the base.

2057
01:56:05,257 --> 01:56:07,092
- You have kids?
- Yeah.

2058
01:56:07,259 --> 01:56:11,180
Is here anyway we can get them to enlist
and go over and help out with the effort?

2059
01:56:11,346 --> 01:56:12,681
I have all the brochures.

2060
01:56:12,848 --> 01:56:14,474
One of them got two children.

2061
01:56:15,267 --> 01:56:16,602
Oh, oh, well!

2062
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:19,188
See, there's not that many Congressmen
that've got kids over there.

2063
01:56:19,354 --> 01:56:20,814
And in fact, only one.

2064
01:56:20,981 --> 01:56:25,986
So we just thought maybe you guys
should send your kids there first.

2065
01:56:26,153 --> 01:56:27,946
What do you think about that idea?

2066
01:56:28,113 --> 01:56:30,115
- I don't disagree with you.
- Oh, you don't?

2067
01:56:30,282 --> 01:56:32,618
Oh good, well, here,
take some brochures then, here.

2068
01:56:32,784 --> 01:56:35,037
At least take a Marine brochure,
and pass it around.

2069
01:56:35,204 --> 01:56:36,121
Yeah!

2070
01:56:36,288 --> 01:56:39,625

Is there any way that...

2083
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:15,786
Uh!

2084

<i>It is remarkable, their gift to us.</i>

2097
01:57:58,787 --> 01:58:00,789
<i>And all they ask for in return,</i>

2098
01:58:01,957 --> 01:58:04,543
<i>is that we never send them
<i>into harm's way.

2099
01:58:05,252 --> 01:58:08,172
<i>Unless it's absolutely necessary.</i>

2100
01:58:10,132 --> 01:58:12,467
<i>Will they ever trust us again?</i>

2101
01:58:13,677 --> 01:58:15,721
He had used weapons.

2102
01:58:15,888 --> 01:58:17,014
We know where they are,

2103
01:58:17,181 --> 01:58:19,683
they're in the area
around Tikrit and Baghdad,

2104
01:58:19,850 --> 01:58:21,602
and East, West, South, and North.

2105
01:58:21,768 --> 01:58:26,064
There is a tie between Iraq
and what happened on 9/11.

2106
01:58:26,565 --> 01:58:31,320
The struggle can only end with
their complete and permanent destruction.

2107
01:58:31,486 --> 01:58:34,948
We waged a war
to save a civilization itself.

2108
01:58:36,783 --> 01:58:38,368
We did not seek it,

2109
01:58:39,453 --> 01:58:42,623
but we will fight it, and we will prevail.

2110
01:58:43,498 --> 01:58:45,501
<i>George Orwell once wrote</i>

2111
01:58:45,667 --> 01:58:50,255
<i>that it's not a matter of whether the war
<i>is not real or if it is.

2112
01:58:50,714 --> 01:58:52,549
<i>Victory is not possible.</i>

2113
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:56,094
<i>The war is not meant to be won.</i>

2114
01:58:56,261 --> 01:58:58,222
<i>It is meant to be continuous.</i>

2115
01:58:59,598 --> 01:59:04,645
<i>A hierarchical society is only possible
<i>on the basis of poverty and ignorance.

2116
01:59:05,979 --> 01:59:08,315
<i>This new version is the past</i>

2117
01:59:08,482 --> 01:59:10,984
<i>and no different past
<i>can ever have existed.

2118
01:59:13,570 --> 01:59:14,655
<i>In principle, the war effort</i>

2119
01:59:14,821 --> 01:59:18,909
<i>is always planned to keep society
<i>on the brink of starvation.

2120
01:59:19,326 --> 01:59:22,412
<i>The war is waged by the ruling group
<i>against its own subjects,

2121
01:59:23,705 --> 01:59:25,415
<i>and its object is not the victory</i>

2122
01:59:25,582 --> 01:59:29,378
<i>over either Eurasia
<i>or East Asia,

2123
01:59:29,545 --> 01:59:33,090
<i>but to keep
<i>the very structure of society intact.

2124
01:59:33,423 --> 01:59:35,175
There's an old saying in Tennessee,

2125
01:59:35,342 --> 01:59:36,927
I know it's in Texas,
probably in Tennessee,

2126
01:59:37,094 --> 01:59:38,887
"Fool me once...

2127
01:59:40,222 --> 01:59:41,640
shame on...

2128
01:59:42,933 --> 01:59:44,101
shame on you!

2129
01:59:47,145 --> 01:59:49,189
Fool me, you can't get fooled again."

2130
01:59:49,356 --> 01:59:51,358
