00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:36,003
<i>So, stick with me here.</i>

4
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,973
<i>I know y'all came to see
a comedy about the Blacks,</i>

5
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:41,775
<i>everyone's favorite family
with the perfect daughter</i>

6
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:44,078
<i>that somehow survived
Terror Night.</i>

7
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,183
<i>You didn't sign up to see
some Egyptians open an evil box</i>

8
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:52,487
<i>and a bat flap his ass
across an Indiana Jones map.</i>

9
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,190
<i>Trust me,
it'll all make sense later.</i>

10
00:00:56,224 --> 00:00:57,925
<i>Well, since we last met,</i>

11
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,362
<i>Dad wrote a bestseller
based on Terror Night.</i>

12
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:02,364
<i>But then Dad and Cronut
blew that money</i>

13
00:01:02,397 --> 00:01:05,032
<i>faster than a rapper
at a strip club.</i>

14
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,203
<i>We're back in Atlanta.</i>

15
00:01:08,236 --> 00:01:10,004
<i>And Dad's writin' the sequel,</i>

16
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:12,374
<i>and we were just getting used
to being back home</i>

17
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:15,876
<i>when this very bat
flew into our lives.</i>

18
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,978
<i>Seriously, pray for us, y'all.</i>

19
00:02:05,427 --> 00:02:07,362
<i>We're back
on the GGN News Network.</i>

20
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:10,130
<i>I'm your host with the most,
Finding Nemo, aka Nemo Hoser.</i>

21
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:12,467
<i>Today on my show,
I got a very special guest,</i>

22
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,004
<i>the one and only, the author Carl
Black in the motherfucking house.</i>

23
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:18,340
<i>Mr. Black,
what's happening?</i>

24
00:02:18,373 --> 00:02:20,107
<i>Snoop!
How are you, man?</i>

25
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,875
<i>I'm good, Carl.
How you doin' today, brother?</i>

26
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,177
<i>I'm excited, man.</i>

27
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:24,945
<i>I got this new book
coming out.</i>

28
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,315
<i>It's called</i> Terror Night.
<i>Mm. I wrote it.</i>

29
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:28,316
<i>It's from my heart.</i>

30
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,651
<i>This is my baby.</i>

31
00:02:29,684 --> 00:02:31,519
<i>What makes this book
a great read</i>

32
00:02:31,553 --> 00:02:33,421
<i>for the average nigga
sitting at home doing nothing?</i>

33
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:37,592
<i>You know, most Black people
know about terror.</i>

34
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,294
<i>Mr. Black, I'm forced
to tell you the truth.</i>

35
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:41,463
<i>It is an easy read.
Real easy.</i>

36
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:43,130
<i>What you mean by that?</i>

37
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,600
<i>"There was
a Black man that..."</i>

38
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,369
<i>That's bullshit, Snoop.</i>

39
00:02:47,402 --> 00:02:49,069
<i>Go get my book.</i>
<i>It's called</i> Terror Night.

40
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,940
<i>All right. All right. All right.
That's enough</i> Terror Night.

41
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,509
<i>All right. All right.
All right. Thank you.</i>

42
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:56,511
<i>Now we got a real guest
coming up on the show.</i>

43
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,613
<i>Make some noise for the
one and only Matt Barnes.</i>

44
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:00,515
<i>Snoop, what's going on, man?
Thanks for having me.</i>

45
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:01,949
<i>Matt!</i>

46
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,585
- <i>Who's that?</i>
- Terror Night.

47
00:03:03,618 --> 00:03:06,153
- Ah, this is Carl Black.
- This book is j... Carl Black, man.

48
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,122
<i>You know me.</i>
<i>I wrote</i> Terror Night.

49
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:09,624
- <i>You read that book?
- The book is crazy.</i>

50
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:11,226
<i>You're gonna love it,
man. And...</i>

51
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:12,594
<i>That book was terrible.</i>

52
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:14,928
<i>One of the worst books
I ever read.</i>

53
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,531
<i>You must be havin' a bad day today.
It's a good book, man.</i>

54
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:18,266
- <i>Nah. It's just a bad book.
- Hey, you should...</i>

55
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,335
- <i>Fuck you.
- Fuck you and that book.</i>

56
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:22,504
<i>I'm gonna get the fucking fuck.</i>

57
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,273
<i>That nigga's excited.</i>

58
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:44,024
<i>Okay.
Just don't. Here.</i>

59
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,651
Hey.

60
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:12,019
Hey!

61
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,356
Hey!

62
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,624
What are you doin'?

63
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:18,393
We're practicing
for the Migos' tour.

64
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:20,228
The streets need us.

65
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,629
The streets
don't need yo ass.

66
00:04:21,663 --> 00:04:24,299
And stop makin'
all that damn noise.

67
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:26,099
- Frickin' old guys!
- And stop playing!

68
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,167
Again from the top.
Ready?

69
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,405
I'm gonna kick your ass.

70
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:32,273
Give me the phone!
Cut if off!

71
00:04:32,307 --> 00:04:34,509
- Dad, come on.
- Cut it off! I'm trying to write.

72
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:36,444
You messed it up again! I bet...

73
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:40,047
Go.

74
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,716
Daddy, get out!

75
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:43,518
- Out.
- Hey! Girl, you better stop throwin' shit.

76
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:46,053
- Go! Shut up!
- I peed in that bed last night.

77
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,099
You know,
I didn't escape the Purge

78
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,237
so somebody would be breakin'
in my fuckin' house!

79
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:18,753
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Man, come on, bro.

80
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:21,422
- What's wrong with you?
- Come on, bro.

81
00:05:21,456 --> 00:05:24,325
- Goddamn!
- What's wrong with you?

82
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:26,361
Goddamn.
Why are you so jumpy?

83
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:29,096
Yeah, 'cause maybe somebody tried to
break in my house and kill me before.

84
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,131
What you doin' creepin' around
my house this late at night?

85
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,468
The lights in the RV went out.
I had to get some flashlights.

86
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:35,637
- Some flashlights?
- Not just flashlight.

87
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,572
Purge lights!
You feel me?

88
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:39,574
You know about these.
Did I tell you about 'em?

89
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:41,643
You don't need no battery.
That means you crank it right up.

90
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:43,278
- Just like this.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, man.

91
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:44,579
- What? What?
- Hey, hey.

92
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:47,180
Get rid of that janky shit!
Stop orderin' it.

93
00:05:47,215 --> 00:05:49,284
Y'all run around here ballin'
and spendin' money,

94
00:05:49,317 --> 00:05:51,686
leavin' the lights on,
runnin' water,

95
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:54,154
like there's money
growin' on the tree.

96
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,457
- I don't have no more money.
- 'Cause you ain't selling no goddamn books.

97
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:59,427
If you sell some goddamn books,
we can goddamn sell these bitches.

98
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,597
- And why're you broke? Huh?
- Get your ass out of here.

99
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,731
Hey, man.
What the fuck, man?

100
00:06:03,765 --> 00:06:06,501
Stop holding me
like a side bitch.

101
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:08,603
- What's you tripping off of?
- This is the reason right here.

102
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:12,373
'Cause I can't imagine
why I let you talk me

103
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:14,409
into spending
my money on this shit.

104
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:16,109
It's all part
of the business plan, cuz.

105
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:17,745
No, no, no.
The business plan

106
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:19,414
is the reason why
Lorena is out

107
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:22,350
busting her ass
to wipe my old ass.

108
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:23,751
Don't nobody want
to hear about me

109
00:06:23,785 --> 00:06:25,787
moving back
into my old neighborhood

110
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,188
while my cousin livin' in an RV
in the back of my house.

111
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,393
What the fuck
is going on over there, man?

112
00:06:32,427 --> 00:06:34,262
Some crackheads.

113
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:35,697
Next door at the old
Marsten house.

114
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,832
They must be squattin'
or somethin'.

115
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,367
- <i>Don't forget the...</i>
- Nah. They live there.

116
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,603
I seen 'em move in,
but the crazy part is

117
00:06:41,636 --> 00:06:43,838
all the windows are boarded.

118
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:46,374
They only come out
at nighttime.

119
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,376
Yeah. Who would move
in a place

120
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,378
with a house that's boarded up like that?

121
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:51,746
And when did they move in?

122
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,381
Yeah. They got in
like a week ago.

123
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:54,849
- What the fuck?
- <i>Snitch, Snitch,</i>

124
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:56,684
- <i>where you at?</i>
- Yeah. I watched 'em do it.

125
00:06:56,718 --> 00:06:58,753
They moved in, man.

126
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:00,822
I see everything.

127
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:03,558
I know you with the neighborhood
watch and everything, but man...

128
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:05,627
it's getting
a little creepy, man.

129
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,795
All right, ladies, in we go. Your coupe is here.

130
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:09,697
- Did you hear that?
- Shhh...

131
00:07:09,731 --> 00:07:11,332
That's some crazy shit.

132
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:22,377
Somethin' strange
goin' on in that house.

133
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:30,918
I'm gone.

134
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:44,432
<i>You will be mine...</i>

135
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:46,534
<i>unconditionally.</i>

136
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:58,579
Baby, I think some new people
just moved in next door.

137
00:07:58,613 --> 00:08:01,549
Oh, baby. Leave
those people alone, babe.

138
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,751
Go back to sleep.

139
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,371
This refrigerator's filthy!

140
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,408
- Appreciate shit.
- Ahem.

141
00:08:28,543 --> 00:08:30,011
What are you doing
here, Cronut?

142
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:31,646
I had to get some milk
for my cereal.

143
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,881
I ran out in the RV.

144
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:35,817
The door's locked
for a reason.

145
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,385
Who messed up that damn toilet?

146
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:39,320
Hey, what the fuck
you doin' in here?

147
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,988
Eating breakfast.
What it look like I'm doin'?

148
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:42,557
You ain't supposed
to be here in the mornings.

149
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,891
You told me I could
come in on Tuesdays.

150
00:08:43,925 --> 00:08:45,259
I'm about sick of your shit.

151
00:08:45,293 --> 00:08:47,295
It's light wheat.

152
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:48,996
Stay out of the toilet.

153
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,932
You know there's a serial
killer living next door.

154
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:53,301
God, this boy run
his damn mouth too much.

155
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:56,404
Hey, Carl, Carl.
Check this shit out, bro.

156
00:08:56,437 --> 00:08:58,339
<i>...the death of Chante Webster.</i>

157
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:01,676
<i>Her badly mutilated corpse
was found inside a dumpster</i>

158
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:05,813
<i>behind Gus's Chicken and
Waffles on Indian Hill Road.</i>

159
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:07,515
They found that body
right around the corner.

160
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,283
<i>This is the sixth incident</i>

161
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:12,353
<i>in a vicious string
of kidnapping and murders,</i>

162
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:16,791
<i>all of which were either
African-American or Mexican.</i>

163
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:19,527
<i>Racially motivated?
Perhaps.</i>

164
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,430
This is exactly why we need to
move out of this neighborhood.

165
00:09:22,463 --> 00:09:24,432
- Move? Again?
- Yes, move.

166
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:26,334
And when we say "move,"

167
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:28,703
- that means us.
- Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

168
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,538
Uh, hey... hey.
No thinkin' for you, okay?

169
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:31,939
What about what we saw
last night?

170
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:33,975
Okay, I don't have time
for this, Carl.

171
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:36,410
I got to go to work.
I'm going to be working a double tonight,

172
00:09:36,444 --> 00:09:37,845
so you're on your own
for dinner.

173
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:40,748
What about what we seen
with the neighbors, bro?

174
00:09:42,884 --> 00:09:44,318
You better do what she say.

175
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:45,453
Fuck you up.

176
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:46,954
She payin' the bills
around here.

177
00:09:46,988 --> 00:09:49,891
Hey, babe. Don't pay
no attention to Cronut.

178
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:51,592
He's just a dumbass.

179
00:09:51,626 --> 00:09:53,628
He's a neglected Chihuahua.

180
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:55,363
Carl, I'm not happy here.

181
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:57,598
- Listen...
- This was supposed to be temporary, Carl.

182
00:09:57,632 --> 00:09:59,600
We were supposed
to be here until you got

183
00:09:59,634 --> 00:10:00,935
- your money going.
- Money.

184
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:03,671
- You wrote your book.
- It's gonna work.

185
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:06,007
That developer came
around again other day.

186
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,410
He can make us a really good
offer on your mom's house.

187
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,445
We can move
to a safer place.

188
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:14,549
I can be happy.
Happy wife, happy what?

189
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:16,717
- Happy wife.
- Happy life.

190
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:18,853
The guy's a fuckin'
vulture. Okay?

191
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:20,655
He wants to move
in this neighborhood

192
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:23,424
so he can take it over and turn
it into a fuckin' strip mall.

193
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,593
Do you understand
what I'm sayin'? Okay?

194
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,395
It's called...
it's called gingivitis.

195
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:28,796
Gentrification!

196
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,831
Shut up, Cronut!

197
00:10:29,864 --> 00:10:31,966
Stupid dumbass nigga.

198
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:34,068
Once we move out of here, who cares
what they do to the neighborhood?

199
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:37,071
Just promise me that today you're
going to look at this and consider it.

200
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,873
I'm... I'm gonna
think about it.

201
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:40,775
I appreciate it.

202
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:44,378
<i>Up next, I survived
a hammer to the head</i>

203
00:10:44,412 --> 00:10:46,881
<i>and a boot to the face.</i>

204
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:49,016
Somethin' fucked-up went
down in that house last night.

205
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,418
You think that was
a dead body?

206
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:52,486
Would you stop?
It's already hard enough

207
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,956
you got all this crazy
shit in my wife's head.

208
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:58,092
And no!
I did not see a body.

209
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,828
I think my first instinct is
like, there's dead body in there.

210
00:11:00,862 --> 00:11:03,531
But... Oh, there's a nice
one over there.

211
00:11:16,811 --> 00:11:17,812
No.

212
00:11:21,883 --> 00:11:23,651
Hey, hey, hey! No!

213
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,519
Why you cock-blocking?
She need me.

214
00:11:25,553 --> 00:11:27,421
This could be
my old lady, man.

215
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:29,891
- She's already married.
- You know I've been in the penitentiary.

216
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:31,559
- Let me just live, brother.
- Okay.

217
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:33,961
You've been to prison
two years ago for 10 days

218
00:11:33,995 --> 00:11:35,563
for drinkin' and drivin'.

219
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:37,598
And you're
a "gangster drinker."

220
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:39,734
I'm just gonna go over there and just...
just rap a tad to her.

221
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:41,168
- I'm gonna go. What's up, baby?
- Cronut.

222
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:46,107
He about to shoot that
midget sperm in that girl.

223
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,009
Bunny! Shit.

224
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:50,111
Baby, I told you,
you got to get a new wheelchair.

225
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:51,746
- You got new wheelchair money?
- Ugh!

226
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,815
- I'm sorry, Bunny.
- It's okay.

227
00:11:54,849 --> 00:11:56,450
I didn't mean
to snap at you.

228
00:11:56,484 --> 00:11:57,952
If my penis worked,
I'd make love to you right now.

229
00:11:57,985 --> 00:11:59,787
- I'd hit it from the back.
- I know you would.

230
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,023
Marky Mark style
from <i>Boogie Nights.</i>

231
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:04,091
Hey! Stay off
my property!

232
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,626
What's up, Clive?

233
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,961
Shouldn't you be makin' up
some bullshit

234
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:08,629
or whatever else you
do you call work?

235
00:12:09,697 --> 00:12:12,867
You know my husband don't like
you guys comin' over here.

236
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,135
But I like seein' you guys.

237
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:15,703
What you been up to?

238
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,138
You been rollin' around
this neighborhood

239
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:20,041
or you just being
kickin' it around?

240
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:22,176
- Funny, motherfucker!
- Kickin' it!

241
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,578
What are you doing,
writin' your next bestseller?

242
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:27,048
Who're you trying to be?
New Alex Haley?

243
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:30,918
Steve Harvey? You gonna try
to make a book into a movie?

244
00:12:30,952 --> 00:12:32,920
You see <i>Think Like a</i> Man?
<i>Think Like a Man 2?</i>

245
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:33,854
Sucked!

246
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:37,158
<i>Pootie Tang</i> blew those
two out the water.

247
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:38,960
Okay, yeah,
I'm writin' a book.

248
00:12:38,993 --> 00:12:41,529
When is
your next marathon, huh?

249
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:43,898
You gonna help me
tend to my garden?

250
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,967
I'll tend the shit out
of that garden.

251
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,569
Tend more than the garden.
I will bend you over in there. I mean...

252
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:49,804
So, I have carrots.

253
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:51,872
I got a carrot.
With a fat head.

254
00:12:51,906 --> 00:12:53,241
What's up with that house
right there?

255
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:55,543
What's up with them people
that live in there?

256
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:58,280
I know you can't see
with them thick-ass glasses.

257
00:12:58,313 --> 00:12:59,647
You know
what these eyes have seen?

258
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,715
Yeah, these nuts.

259
00:13:00,748 --> 00:13:02,149
I've been in three wars.

260
00:13:02,183 --> 00:13:04,051
- How you think I got Bunny?
- The government.

261
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:06,087
That little check you get every
month, she's takin' it.

262
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,189
- I saw into her soul.
- Damn.

263
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,825
I see that little man right there with
the 8th-grade body talkin' to my wife.

264
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:11,892
You don't think
I see that?

265
00:13:11,926 --> 00:13:13,027
I saw you catch gonorrhea,
baby...

266
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,296
You better watch
your fuckin' mouth!

267
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:15,963
- Watch your mouth, man!
- I wish you would.

268
00:13:15,997 --> 00:13:17,765
I wish you...
I've been waiting on this.

269
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,567
Why would you kick me in the leg

270
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,003
- where I can't feel it?
- I know you can't... can't feel it.

271
00:13:22,036 --> 00:13:24,171
Come on. You ain't the first
Black guy I got in a fight with.

272
00:13:24,206 --> 00:13:26,308
I can't feel my legs, Carl.
Hit me in the face.

273
00:13:27,775 --> 00:13:28,876
You little bitch.

274
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,778
All day, every day.

275
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:33,714
Listen, man. Somethin' ain't
right at that house, Carl.

276
00:13:33,748 --> 00:13:35,082
They moved
in the middle of night.

277
00:13:35,116 --> 00:13:37,319
There's never any movement
during the day.

278
00:13:37,352 --> 00:13:39,321
- Yeah.
- Lazy shits won't answer the door,

279
00:13:39,354 --> 00:13:40,621
had a package dropped off.

280
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,556
Mailman brought it
over to me,

281
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,692
sittin' on the front
porch right now.

282
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:47,762
Hey, Bunny! Come get
that package from Africa!

283
00:13:47,795 --> 00:13:49,063
Hey, Bunny!

284
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:50,865
Get that package
over there on the back porch.

285
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:52,633
- I wouldn't. I wouldn't.
- You might get on...

286
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,101
- You feel that, Carl?
- Okay. Let my arm go.

287
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:57,205
- Let my arm go.
- Let my cousin... aw!

288
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:58,306
- It fucking hurts.
- Hey.

289
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,308
Let it go!
That shit hurt.

290
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:02,710
Dang, you got some
upper body strength.

291
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:04,779
There it is.
Look at that... Africa.

292
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:06,781
Africa.
Wrapped in velvet.

293
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,858
I'm gonna take it
over there myself.

294
00:14:17,892 --> 00:14:20,295
Cronut...
Cronut!

295
00:14:20,328 --> 00:14:22,297
Why you give him
the fuckin' package?!

296
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,833
It's like we're living across the
street from <i>Diff'rent Strokes.</i>

297
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,135
- Hey, hey, hey. Give me the package, man.
- What the shit?

298
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:29,570
Cronut!

299
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:33,074
See? You happy?

300
00:14:35,176 --> 00:14:37,279
You got me runnin' around here,
fightin' motherfuckers and shit...

301
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:40,948
- I can't do this, man.
- Fuck this, I gotta find out.

302
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:44,085
- Hey, hey, hey...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey my ass.

303
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:45,220
Get it. Get it.

304
00:15:02,304 --> 00:15:05,240
What can I do to... I mean,
for you, gentlemen?

305
00:15:05,273 --> 00:15:06,874
Nigga, we saw you transporting
dead bodies last night.

306
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,009
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, man.
Shut the fuck up.

307
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:10,345
We did.

308
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:12,980
You not see me
transport any dead bodies.

309
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:15,783
We standin' in front of a
chocolate vampire-type nigga.

310
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:19,186
Sir, and this my little cousin,
Cronut, he's a little retarded.

311
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:21,323
- Slow as fuck.
- He needs special attention.

312
00:15:21,356 --> 00:15:24,091
- He's on Ritalin, prednisone, and all kind of shit.
- Everything.

313
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,694
This is Dr. Mamuwalde's
residence.

314
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:28,829
Mama... Mama who?

315
00:15:28,863 --> 00:15:30,064
Ma-mu-wal-day.

316
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,099
- How you pronounce that?
- Ma-mu-wal-day.

317
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:34,101
Mamuwal...

318
00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:35,437
Ma-mu-wal-day.

319
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,340
- Ma-mu-wal-day.
- Ma-mwa-wal-di.

320
00:15:38,373 --> 00:15:39,940
- Ma-mu-wal-day.
- Ma-mwa-wal-di.

321
00:15:39,974 --> 00:15:41,309
- Ma-mu-wal-day.
- Ma-mwa-wal-di.

322
00:15:41,343 --> 00:15:42,710
- Fix your mouth.
- All right, all right.

323
00:15:42,743 --> 00:15:44,346
- Excuse me.
- Your mama, nigga.

324
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:47,282
I am Monty. I just
rent a room here.

325
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:50,684
And I assure you,
you have seen no bodies.

326
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:52,354
Pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

327
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:54,788
Nigga, we saw you transport them
goddamn dead bodies in the back.

328
00:15:54,822 --> 00:15:57,158
- If you don't shut the fuck...
- Where you from, bro?

329
00:15:57,191 --> 00:15:59,793
- Hey, man, stop! Sir...
- What?

330
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:02,096
Mr. Black, do you have
business here?

331
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,798
No. I don't have no business here.
We just wanted to come through and say hey

332
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:06,401
and make sure
everything was cool.

333
00:16:06,434 --> 00:16:08,068
Why wouldn't it be cool?

334
00:16:09,337 --> 00:16:11,239
- Excuse me?
- Why wouldn't it be?

335
00:16:11,273 --> 00:16:15,243
Because y'all moving in this
motherfucking house at 12:00 at night.

336
00:16:15,277 --> 00:16:17,279
There's people
sleeping around here.

337
00:16:17,312 --> 00:16:21,148
You got crackheads back there
sunbathing into fucking midnight.

338
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,952
Bye, bitch!

339
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,154
Hey, come on.
Get your ass...

340
00:16:28,022 --> 00:16:31,426
I'm gonna drop a dime
on you motherfuckers.

341
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:34,828
You happy you done made me waste
a whole day on some bullshit?

342
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:36,797
- Hey, man. Just fall back.
- Fall back for what?

343
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,932
What you got to say now?

344
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:39,334
You don't think
that shit weird?

345
00:16:40,502 --> 00:16:42,102
How'd he know
your last name?

346
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:44,206
I'm a famous writer,
Cronut.

347
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:45,739
This nigga delusional.

348
00:16:45,773 --> 00:16:48,410
My book is in-in-in
Barnes and Noble's.

349
00:16:48,443 --> 00:16:52,214
Nigga! Ain't nobody
reading your books! Retire!

350
00:16:52,247 --> 00:16:54,249
Look, you're running
around here smoking that weed,

351
00:16:54,282 --> 00:16:57,319
you're paranoid,
you're smoking 2K, K2,

352
00:16:57,352 --> 00:16:58,786
or whatever the fuck
you doing...

353
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:00,455
First of all,
I'm not smoking K2.

354
00:17:00,488 --> 00:17:02,224
I'm smoking strictly weed.

355
00:17:02,257 --> 00:17:04,191
And second of all,
something ain't right about that house,

356
00:17:04,226 --> 00:17:07,995
because boy was from Africa,
but he had a French accent.

357
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,898
He got a sideburn that curl
up, like the devil.

358
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:13,368
I'm thinking, man. You?
We got to get to the bottom of it.

359
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:16,103
We not getting
to the bottom of shit.

360
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,172
Well, you write your book.
I'll just be a detective.

361
00:17:18,206 --> 00:17:19,541
A detective for what?

362
00:17:19,574 --> 00:17:24,546
Africa, Carl. Africa.
Are you listening to me?

363
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,281
Southwest don't go
to Africa.

364
00:17:26,314 --> 00:17:28,015
You won't help me do shit.

365
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,050
I'm trying to marry
this man wife,

366
00:17:30,084 --> 00:17:31,852
I'm trying to tell you about

Allie Black.

388
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,219
Yes, Daddy? Yes?

389
00:18:38,253 --> 00:18:40,020
- What you doing?
- I'm studying.

390
00:18:40,054 --> 00:18:41,323
- You're studying.
- Yes.

391
00:18:41,356 --> 00:18:42,956
Yeah. I thought you
was home for fall?

392
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,958
Doesn't mean I still
don't have to study, Dad.

393
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:47,961
You know our family have been
going through a lot of stuff,

394
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:50,632
and you don't like to follow
the rules all the time,

395
00:18:50,665 --> 00:18:53,000
'cause I've been asked you
a whole bunch of times

396
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:54,968
to keep these little boys
out of my...

397
00:18:55,002 --> 00:18:56,937
- Daddy, I can explain...
- Ah! What the hell is wrong with you?

398
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,206
I know a lot of gang shit.
You know...

399
00:18:58,239 --> 00:18:59,507
I thought he was dead!

400
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,942
No, bitch.
Dying's for pussies.

401
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,412
I told you to keep these
little boys out of this house.

402
00:19:04,446 --> 00:19:06,548
I sent you to school
for a education...

403
00:19:06,581 --> 00:19:08,650
- I had to drop out, okay?
- You dropped out?

404
00:19:08,683 --> 00:19:11,051
We dropped out.
A couple goes...

405
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:13,588
You and him about to be living off
that little cripple check every month.

406
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:15,590
- Baby, give me my cane. I'm out.
- Okay.

407
00:19:15,623 --> 00:19:17,425
Yeah, this
don't make no sense.

408
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:19,126
I don't know what
you going through, Allie.

409
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,363
Daddy, Daddy. Just...
just leave him alone, okay?

410
00:19:21,396 --> 00:19:23,063
If you're gonna do
somethin', do somethin'.

411
00:19:23,097 --> 00:19:24,299
It's already done.

412
00:19:24,332 --> 00:19:26,066
If you're gonna do
somethin', do somethin'.

413
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,469
Freezee!

414
00:19:27,502 --> 00:19:28,936
Daddy,
why'd you do that?

415
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:30,070
I didn't even touch him.

416
00:19:30,104 --> 00:19:31,373
That's all right.
You got it, baby?

417
00:19:31,406 --> 00:19:32,640
Come on. Help his arm.
Get his arm right there.

418
00:19:32,674 --> 00:19:34,609
Hey, I don't need your help!
I'm in the ADA.

419
00:19:34,642 --> 00:19:36,143
Baby, you do need help.

420
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,579
- All right.
- You need some help, okay?

421
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:40,114
Yeah. Lift him up.
One, two, three.

422
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:43,485
Fuck you! Ain't nobody
need your assistance.

423
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:45,286
Baby, go start
the car, okay?

424
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,222
- All right.
- We'll be out of here in a second.

425
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:48,690
I'm gonna let you know one thing.
My dick may not work,

426
00:19:48,723 --> 00:19:51,626
but my tongue game's
strong on your girl.

427
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:53,261
Okay. Baby, go.

428
00:19:53,294 --> 00:19:54,529
Ask him for some
gas money, baby.

429
00:19:54,562 --> 00:19:56,997
I will. I'll ask him
for some. Okay.

430
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,500
Oh, thank God.

431
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:00,468
But why don't you get
somebody that can walk?

432
00:20:00,502 --> 00:20:02,002
I ain't helping.

433
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,971
Daddy, listen.
Okay, I had to drop out

434
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:06,039
because your check bounced.

435
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:08,108
And you would know that if you
cared about anybody in this family

436
00:20:08,142 --> 00:20:10,144
except yourself
and that damn book.

437
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:12,614
He loves me.

438
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,017
He only cares about himself.
He's so selfish.

439
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,586
Allie!

440
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,658
Allie!

441
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:25,226
Allie!

442
00:20:29,697 --> 00:20:32,567
Ekekek. Ekekek.

443
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,302
Psst! Ekekek.

444
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,373
Carl, come here.

445
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:39,574
You gotta see this shit.

446
00:20:39,607 --> 00:20:41,209
Get over where?
How do I get over there?

447
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:42,444
Hop over, man.

448
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:47,215
No, no, for real.
For real. Come here.

449
00:20:47,248 --> 00:20:49,451
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Calm down. Calm down.

450
00:20:49,484 --> 00:20:51,619
Check that. Shit!

451
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:57,525
Is that Michael Jackson?

452

<i>Where's the box from Africa?</i>

453
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:00,994
- That's so weird.
- Hey! Hey, man!

454
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:02,530
Hey, man,
don't do that!

455
00:21:02,564 --> 00:21:04,566
Why are you always
creeping up on people, man?

456
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:07,202
- Don't do that.
- That's what I do. I creep.

457
00:21:07,235 --> 00:21:09,637
- Look, look.
- <i>Find it.</i>

458
00:21:10,872 --> 00:21:13,675
They just moved into the house
and people are already coming over.

459
00:21:16,744 --> 00:21:19,314
Goddamn. She got
a big 'ol ass.

460
00:21:21,282 --> 00:21:24,017
Hello. I'm here
for Dr. Mamuwalde.

461
00:21:32,794 --> 00:21:34,429
Something ain't right.

462
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:35,663
I'mma tell you
something.

463
00:21:35,697 --> 00:21:38,733
Leave them goddamn
neighbors alone.

464
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:42,270
- Leave them alone! I'm out of here.
- Look.

465
00:21:42,303 --> 00:21:43,471
I think you
made him mad.

466
00:21:43,505 --> 00:21:45,540
He's always mad at me.
Don't even trip.

467
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:47,642
She ain't coming back out of there.
I told you, once you go in there,

468
00:21:47,675 --> 00:21:49,744
you ain't coming out,
especially if you're fine.

469
00:21:49,777 --> 00:21:52,514
All the ugly bitches came right
out, but this coochie?

470
00:21:52,547 --> 00:21:54,782
I'm going in.

471
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,484
I'm neighborhood watch.

472
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:02,457
Yeah. You go
right on in there.

473
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,659
I trust you.

474
00:22:04,692 --> 00:22:06,361
<i>Snitch, Snitch, come in.</i>

475
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,533
What can I do for you?

476
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:13,835
I'm neighborhood watch.
I need to get in this house.

477
00:22:13,868 --> 00:22:17,405
Well then, please, come in,
Mr. Neighborhood Watch.

478
00:22:17,438 --> 00:22:19,172
You're very welcome here.

479
00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:28,349
Cronut, what the fuck
are you doing?

480
00:22:28,383 --> 00:22:29,350
Shhh!

481
00:22:32,353 --> 00:22:34,689
Why are you looking
in their window?

482
00:22:34,722 --> 00:22:36,224
Get out of them
people's house.

483
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,661
What you see?

484
00:22:39,694 --> 00:22:41,329
Well, first of all,
this house looks amazing on the inside,

485
00:22:41,362 --> 00:22:44,465
but they're doing
some freaky shit for real.

486
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:48,336
What? What's he doing?

487
00:22:51,506 --> 00:22:55,108
Cronut! What's going on?

488
00:22:55,142 --> 00:22:57,612
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- What? What? What?

489
00:22:57,645 --> 00:23:00,248
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- What? What?

490
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:01,716
Go, go.

491
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:07,455
- Oh, shit.
- Why we running, man?

492
00:23:07,488 --> 00:23:10,358
- Hey, <i>¿qué pasó?</i>
- OG. Hugo.

493
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:12,260
There's vampires, man.
There's vampires.

494
00:23:12,293 --> 00:23:13,561
Re... relax. Ain't no...

495
00:23:13,595 --> 00:23:16,531
The vampire feeds on blood.

496
00:23:16,564 --> 00:23:20,368
But what he really wants

497
00:23:20,401 --> 00:23:22,870
is to find the things
that you love most

498
00:23:22,904 --> 00:23:25,105
and twist you...

499
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:30,110
and torment you
every day of your life.

500
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,282
You're a dark motherfucker.

501
00:23:34,315 --> 00:23:36,851
You've been saying some crazy
shit back here in this backyard.

502
00:23:36,884 --> 00:23:38,653
So what should we do, OG?

503
00:23:38,686 --> 00:23:40,622
Find out what he wants.

504
00:23:42,557 --> 00:23:45,860
Find out what he's doing
in our neighborhood.

505
00:23:45,893 --> 00:23:47,428
Think about it.

506
00:23:47,462 --> 00:23:49,297
We ain't never seen
Dr. Mamuwalde in the daytime.

507
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,832
- You know why?
- Why?

508
00:23:50,865 --> 00:23:52,767
"And they rise from
the grave at night

509
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,902
- to feast on the living."
- Oh, no.

510
00:23:54,936 --> 00:23:57,605
Shut the fuck up
for a second.

511
00:23:57,639 --> 00:23:59,474
Just for one second,
shut the fuck up.

512
00:23:59,507 --> 00:24:02,310
You know what? All that
coming to... to life

513
00:24:02,343 --> 00:24:05,680
and the dead rising up
and the <i>Tales of the Crypt</i>

514
00:24:05,713 --> 00:24:07,915
and the Michael Jackson,
the monsters,

515
00:24:07,949 --> 00:24:10,385
all that is a bunch of bullshit!

516
00:24:10,418 --> 00:24:12,353
Did you see the little
guy in the window?

517
00:24:12,387 --> 00:24:13,788
'Cause you probably
think it's Prince

518
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:15,757
or I don't know who
the fuck you think it is.

519
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,492
It's a little pimp in there.

520
00:24:18,426 --> 00:24:21,863
Bitches is getting slapped
over in that house.

521
00:24:21,896 --> 00:24:23,898
Man, I know what I saw, man.
That was a goddamn vampire.

522
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:25,500
Definitely.
I know what I saw.

523
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:27,802
A pimp live next door
to us, okay?

524
00:24:27,835 --> 00:24:29,604
P-I-M-P.

525
00:24:29,637 --> 00:24:31,839
Put it in my pocket.

526
00:24:31,873 --> 00:24:35,576
The reason why he sleep all day?
Because pimping is at night!

527
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,578
I'm gone. I'm getting
the fuck out of here.

528
00:24:37,612 --> 00:24:39,213
I'm finna go write my book.

529
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:40,848
You done lost
your motherfucking mind.

530
00:24:40,882 --> 00:24:42,717
You need to go sign
up for the circus.

531
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,720
- Oh, man.
- Don't invite him in.

532
00:24:45,753 --> 00:24:47,321
What?

533
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:49,323
Only way to keep a vampire
out of your house.

534
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:51,392
Don't invite him in.

535
00:24:52,527 --> 00:24:53,995
I'm gone, man. I ain't...

536
00:24:54,028 --> 00:24:56,330
Yeah, you go, man.
We're gonna get to the bottom of it.

537
00:24:56,364 --> 00:24:58,399
I'm gonna do some research.
We'll figure it out, bro!

538
00:24:58,433 --> 00:25:00,234
- Just trust me!
- Shut the fuck up.

539
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:02,937
Well, what about...
what about if you live in the RV?

540
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,606
- Is there any rules there?
- Don't invite him in.

541
00:25:21,556 --> 00:25:23,858
I ain't got no more bananas,
'cause this shit is...

542
00:25:23,891 --> 00:25:26,594
They got... bats.

543
00:25:26,627 --> 00:25:28,262
Vampire coming at me.

544
00:25:28,296 --> 00:25:29,630
God, I didn't sign up
for this shit.

545
00:25:31,332 --> 00:25:35,303
Fucking nude.

546
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:38,573
<i>Dispatch
to Snitch. Over.</i>

547
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:41,642
Do you know what
happens to snitches?

548
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:49,751
Shit!

549
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:53,321
These bitches bit
Snitch's neck!

550
00:25:53,354 --> 00:25:56,290
Mama! Oh, shit!
That was shit. They got me.

551
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:59,627
Oh, damn. Oh, damn.

552
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:13,307
<i>You know me as the one
that survived the Purge.</i>

553
00:26:13,341 --> 00:26:16,043
<i>Therefore, I could survive anything.</i>

554
00:26:16,077 --> 00:26:17,578
<i>What is going on
in your life?</i>

555
00:26:17,612 --> 00:26:19,714
- Late night?
- Oh. Hey.

556
00:26:19,747 --> 00:26:21,549
Yeah. It was
the worst last night.

557
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:22,917
I can explain, though.

558
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,853
Can you tell me
what happened with Allie?

559
00:26:25,887 --> 00:26:28,790
- She called you?
- She's mad because you don't trust her.

560
00:26:28,823 --> 00:26:29,991
No. She had
her little boy in my house.

561
00:26:30,024 --> 00:26:31,826
She ain't paying no
rent up in here.

562
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:33,795
You need to be the bigger man
and call her and apologize,

563
00:26:33,828 --> 00:26:36,063
because I'm not dealing
with all of this mess.

564
00:26:36,097 --> 00:26:39,400
And speaking of which, did you call the
real estate agent like I asked you to?

565
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:40,735
Oh, man.

566
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,538
I'm mentally exhausted
from all of this.

567
00:26:43,571 --> 00:26:45,773
I'm having a hard
time writing, okay?

568
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:47,809
<i>Lorena.</i>

569
00:26:49,944 --> 00:26:51,946
<i>Come, Lorena.</i>

570
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:55,349
Oh, my God.

571
00:26:55,383 --> 00:26:58,019
- Oh, my God.
- What's going on with you?

572
00:26:58,052 --> 00:26:59,587
Oh, my God.

573
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,922
- <i>Do you feel it</i>...
- Oh, my God.

574
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:02,423
- <i>...all over your body?</i>
- Oh, shit.

575
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:03,457
How is this happening?

576
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:04,859
Oh, my God.

577
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:06,794
Am I missing out
on something?

578
00:27:06,828 --> 00:27:09,463
Oh, yes.
Don't stop.

579
00:27:09,497 --> 00:27:12,567
Oh, my. Carl.

580
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,901
Carl,
did you hear that?

581
00:27:13,935 --> 00:27:15,703
Hey, you didn't... you
didn't came in here.

582
00:27:15,736 --> 00:27:18,372
Shhh!

583
00:27:18,406 --> 00:27:21,742
Okay, then.
That's what I needed.

584
00:27:21,776 --> 00:27:25,046
<i>Local authorities are
hesitant to label this a serial killer...</i>

585
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:27,615
- Oh, my God. - <i>...but sources
close to the investigation</i>

586
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:29,450
<i>were heard saying</i>

00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:32,920
<i>"This is some fucked up shit
right here, my nigga."</i>

588
00:27:32,954 --> 00:27:34,922
Who's doing all these terrible
things to these women?

589
00:27:34,956 --> 00:27:36,824
- <i>...they went on to say the dead...</i>
- Oh, my God.

590
00:27:36,858 --> 00:27:38,759
I'm telling you,
we need to get out of here.

591
00:27:38,793 --> 00:27:40,661
Can you please, please
call that real estate man?

592
00:27:40,695 --> 00:27:42,396
- The paper's right there.
- I'm gonna call.

593
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,664
- I'm gonna call him.
- Okay.

594
00:27:43,698 --> 00:27:45,166
- <i>...signing off saying...</i>
- Now.

595
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:48,002
- Call him, please.
- <i>...hoes got to eat too.</i>

596
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,678
Allie!

597
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,115
This is my 17th message.

598
00:28:01,148 --> 00:28:04,018
Please call me back, okay?
I'm looking for you.

599
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:06,754
I'm worried about you.
Call me back.

600
00:28:08,723 --> 00:28:10,124
Hey.

601
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:14,161
Listen, I'm not letting
you in my house

602
00:28:14,195 --> 00:28:16,030
so you can tell them
same ghost stories...

603
00:28:16,063 --> 00:28:17,632
No, you need to see
this for real.

604
00:28:17,665 --> 00:28:19,133
<i>Snitch,
do you read me?</i>

605
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:20,635
Look like
a busted bike to me.

606
00:28:20,668 --> 00:28:23,104
No, look.
This Rico bike.

607
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:25,806
- They done kidnapped Rico, bro.
- <i>Dispatch to Snitch, over.</i>

608
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,742
He don't go nowhere
without this bike.

609
00:28:27,775 --> 00:28:30,144
His license suspended.
He got no choice but to ride this bike.

610
00:28:30,177 --> 00:28:33,147
Look, Rico is a grown man
who done looked in the mirror

611
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,016
and realized
he ain't got no business

612
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:37,985
being 50 years old
on a tricycle.

613
00:28:38,019 --> 00:28:39,620
Or the vampires
could have got him.

614
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:42,757
<i>Dispatch to Snitch, over.</i>

615
00:28:44,226 --> 00:28:46,193
Rico saw
something last night.

616
00:28:46,228 --> 00:28:48,129
I think I bet the vampires
snatched his ass up.

617
00:28:48,162 --> 00:28:50,164
<i>Snitch, what is your 411?</i>

618
00:28:50,197 --> 00:28:52,099
That's Freezee's car.

619
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:54,535
In there pimping
my daughter!

620
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:03,778
The sun's setting.

621
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,716
The vampire's
about to wake up.

622
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:10,451
Don't invite him in.

623
00:29:13,688 --> 00:29:15,223
<i>Imbecile!</i>

624
00:29:15,257 --> 00:29:17,124
<i>Damn it, man!
You scared the hell out of me!</i>

625
00:29:17,158 --> 00:29:19,794
<i>Who the hell you
callin' an imbecile?</i>

626
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:22,964
<i>Now listen, you take your hands off of me!
I don't know you!</i>

627
00:29:27,535 --> 00:29:28,769
Whoop.

628
00:29:28,803 --> 00:29:30,638
- Stop playing!
- Got you.

629
00:29:30,671 --> 00:29:31,772
You little bitch.

630
00:29:36,345 --> 00:29:38,913
No, but for real, though, this is crazy.
What is we doing?

631
00:29:41,048 --> 00:29:42,783
I know Allie's
in this house.

632
00:29:42,817 --> 00:29:44,685
Allie!

633
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:46,988
These maniacs done kidnapped Rico
and you just banging on the door?

634
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:48,622
I've been calling
Allie all day

635
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:50,024
and she ain't answer
the phone. Relax.

636
00:29:50,057 --> 00:29:51,792
Allie!

637
00:29:51,826 --> 00:29:54,695
- What the fuck?
- Can I help you, gentlemen?

638
00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:57,031
My daughter's
in there, man.

639
00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:59,667
Come on, man. Give me my daughter
back, man. This is crazy.

640
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,936
You got the fuckin'
Halloween shit going on?

641
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:03,771
That's my daughter!

642
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:06,308
I'm sure I don't know
what you mean, neighbor.

643
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:08,243
The car is in the back.

644
00:30:08,276 --> 00:30:10,245
I've been looking
for my daughter all day.

645
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:11,779
Your pimping gonna stop.

646
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:13,281
God don't like ugly, man.

647
00:30:13,315 --> 00:30:16,851
Mr. Black, your daughter
is not in this house.

648
00:30:16,884 --> 00:30:17,918
Ah!

649
00:30:20,288 --> 00:30:22,957
Can I come in the house?

650
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,059
The doctor will not
be here until later.

651
00:30:25,092 --> 00:30:28,129
I wonder why? You got all them dead
bodies in there you don't want us to see?

652
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:31,299
But, if you'd like
to come in, Mr. Black,

653
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:36,637
you will find out in fact that
your daughter is not in this house.

654
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,572
- We can come in and search the whole...
- Mr. Black, please.

655
00:30:38,606 --> 00:30:39,974
You want... that's what you
want us to do?

656
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:41,542
Please.

657
00:30:43,911 --> 00:30:45,046
Be my guest.

658
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:47,081
You want some real niggas...

659
00:30:47,114 --> 00:30:48,350
Enjoy yourselves, please.

660
00:30:48,383 --> 00:30:49,950
- ...come in your house?
- Go.

661
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,356
Hey, stop.

662
00:30:57,392 --> 00:30:58,626
Allie!

663
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:00,228
Allie!

664
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:03,964
What?

665
00:31:03,998 --> 00:31:06,133
- Carl, look at this shit.
- What?

666
00:31:12,407 --> 00:31:15,042
That shit
look crazy, man.

667
00:31:15,076 --> 00:31:17,011
What the fuck is that
dog thing right there?

668
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:18,213
- Mr. Black!
- Hey! Shit!

669
00:31:18,246 --> 00:31:20,014
Damn, bro!
What the fuck is going on?

670
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:21,216
- What's wrong with you, bro?
- Don't touch these dolls.

671
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:23,050
What is wrong with you?

672
00:31:23,084 --> 00:31:27,655
These are very, very expensive
West African voodoo totems.

673
00:31:27,688 --> 00:31:29,723
- The doctor is a collector.
- Allie!

674
00:31:32,227 --> 00:31:33,261
Allie!

675
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:39,234
Allie! Whoa!

676
00:31:40,134 --> 00:31:42,204
- Is my daddy in here?
- Please come in, Allie.

677
00:31:42,237 --> 00:31:43,238
Carl.

678
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:46,107
- What?
- Guess who come in.

679
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,875
Dad! What are you
doing here?

680
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:50,177
Allie, what are you doing?
Where your ass been at?

681
00:31:50,212 --> 00:31:51,413
What the hell's going on?

682
00:31:51,446 --> 00:31:53,147
Why are you
in these nice people's house?

683
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,350
These people ain't nice.
This is a pimp's house.

684
00:31:55,383 --> 00:31:57,285
- This is a nice house.
- Oh, my God.

685
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:59,221
Man, this is crazy!
Look, he's been putting

686
00:31:59,254 --> 00:32:01,856
all kind of crazy stories
in my head about you.

687
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:03,691
The car's in the back...

688
00:32:03,724 --> 00:32:06,328
See, I knew you were going to
be tripping when you found out.

689
00:32:06,361 --> 00:32:08,729
God. Found out what?

690
00:32:09,531 --> 00:32:12,032
I just gotta tell you.
I'm just going to say it.

691
00:32:14,135 --> 00:32:16,070
- I'm movin' out.
- Movin' out where?

692
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:18,139
Me and Freezee
are going to get married

693
00:32:18,172 --> 00:32:19,807
and we're going
to make a life together.

694
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,210
I will take my belt off
and tear your ass up.

695
00:32:22,244 --> 00:32:25,079
Daddy, I can make my own choices.
It's called feminism.

696
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:28,383
<i>Oh,
I know all about liberating some women.</i>

697
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,252
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

698
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:43,797
Let me introduce
Dr. Mamuwalde!

699
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:48,836
Dr. Mamuwalde.

700
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:52,006
Dr. Mamuwalde.

701
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:54,276
Dr. Mamuwalde.

702
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,345
Dr. Mamuwalde.

703
00:32:58,346 --> 00:33:00,848
Dr. Mamuwalde.

704
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:03,751
So beautiful.

705
00:33:03,784 --> 00:33:05,920
Dr. Mamuwalde.

706
00:33:07,422 --> 00:33:10,191
Dr. Mamuwalde.

707
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:13,928
Dr. Mamuwalde.

708
00:33:13,961 --> 00:33:16,498
Is that a Black
bite-sized Hugh Hefner?

709
00:33:16,531 --> 00:33:19,166
Dr. Mamuwalde.

710
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,769
Dr. Mamuwalde.

711
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,273
Dr. Mamuwalde.

712
00:33:25,307 --> 00:33:26,907
All right, man.

713
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:29,910
Monty, I told you,
three times.

714
00:33:29,944 --> 00:33:31,446
Yeah, nigga, damn.

715
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:33,248
Every day is a struggle,

716
00:33:33,281 --> 00:33:36,451
but every night
is a feast, you feel me?

717
00:33:36,484 --> 00:33:39,954
Carl Black!
Show me some love.

718
00:33:39,987 --> 00:33:41,289
I can give you some
from right here.

719
00:33:41,323 --> 00:33:43,023
I can't come over
and give up no...

720
00:33:43,057 --> 00:33:45,393
- no love shit, dog.
- Mm-mm.

721
00:33:45,427 --> 00:33:49,431
Welcome to my humble abode,
Carl Black.

722
00:33:49,464 --> 00:33:51,466
How the fuck
do you know my name?

723
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:54,768
That's what's crazy.
You been on my IG page?

724
00:33:54,802 --> 00:33:57,104
Oh, I've had
my third eye on you.

725
00:33:57,137 --> 00:33:58,806
I mean, if it was about
that shit the other night,

726
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,040
all right, look,
I ain't got...

727
00:34:00,074 --> 00:34:02,510
The doctor is
a fan of your book...

728
00:34:02,544 --> 00:34:03,545
- Ooh.
- Mr. Black.

729
00:34:03,578 --> 00:34:05,513
Shit. Mm.

730
00:34:05,547 --> 00:34:08,182
And doodoo is
a fan of your mouth.

731
00:34:08,216 --> 00:34:10,184
- Dad.
- You know my book?

732
00:34:10,218 --> 00:34:11,553
- Wow.
- Mm.

733
00:34:11,586 --> 00:34:13,187
I told you, you got
to get back in there.

734
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:15,290
You know he's in, uh,
a tough spot right now.

735
00:34:15,323 --> 00:34:16,790
- He's in a artistic bind.
- Yeah. I'm trying to write a new book.

736
00:34:16,824 --> 00:34:18,493
Yeah. You see,
the first one was good.

737
00:34:18,526 --> 00:34:20,328
- Yeah. The second one.
- Now, I'm trying to do...

738
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:22,364
- I'm trying to do the second one.
- Gotta be off the chain.

739
00:34:22,397 --> 00:34:24,031
It's a fine piece
of literature.

740
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:26,033
The shit was
a modern-day classic.

741
00:34:27,535 --> 00:34:29,471
Dr. Mamuwalde.

742
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:33,107
What type of medicine
you practice, bro?

743
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,343
I practice
the type of medicine

744
00:34:35,377 --> 00:34:37,911
for those
with a particular affliction.

745
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:40,848
Take two of these and call me in the morning.

746
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:44,286
Oh, this.

747
00:34:44,319 --> 00:34:45,420
Bless his name.

748
00:34:45,453 --> 00:34:47,322
I knew you was a pimp.

749
00:34:47,355 --> 00:34:49,890
- Ha. Such harsh language, Mr. Black.
- Yeah.

750
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:52,159
I am a purveyor
and provocateur

751
00:34:52,192 --> 00:34:56,063
of fine ass bitches
and high-priced pleasure.

752
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:58,466
I know what I'm looking at
when I see it.

753
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,268
Hold on. Wait a minute,
little George Jefferson.

754
00:35:00,302 --> 00:35:02,903
We ain't doing no provocative
nothin' around here.

755
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:04,306
This is my daughter.

756
00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:06,341
Ain't nothin' going up
in there but a tampon.

757
00:35:06,374 --> 00:35:07,941
- Daddy!
- Mr. Black, I assure you,

758
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:11,078
I may be a pimp,
but I am no monster.

759
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:13,581
Matter of fact, to prove my point,

760
00:35:13,615 --> 00:35:18,952
allow me. A mind is
a terrible thing to waste.

761
00:35:18,986 --> 00:35:21,188
This is for your education.

762
00:35:21,222 --> 00:35:22,223
Really?

763
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:28,496
- No.
- Ooh. Daddy!

764
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:31,299
No! We ain't raisin'
no THOTs around here!

765
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:33,167
- We ain't doing no THOTin'!
- But we need the money!

766
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,570
You... but we ain't getting
the money that kind of way.

767
00:35:35,603 --> 00:35:38,406
We sellin' books
around here, not pussy!

768
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,141
The Black man has yet again
said no to education.

769
00:35:41,175 --> 00:35:43,511
- Fuck you! Come on. Get your ass out of here.
- Daddy!

770
00:35:43,545 --> 00:35:45,979
- Why are you always yelling at people?
- Fuck you, Mr. Mamuwalde.

771
00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:47,915
Thank you, nice man!

772
00:35:47,948 --> 00:35:50,618
Well, let me just say I'm
having a soirée tomorrow night

773
00:35:50,652 --> 00:35:52,920
and I would be honored
if you would join me.

774
00:35:52,953 --> 00:35:54,823
I'm expensive!

775
00:35:59,227 --> 00:36:02,330
Tomorrow night is the soirée.

776
00:36:02,364 --> 00:36:03,398
Oh, oh.

777
00:36:05,032 --> 00:36:08,303
- Save them for me.
- We expect to be seeing you.

778
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:23,251
You always do this,
Daddy.

779
00:36:23,284 --> 00:36:25,152
Why wouldn't you let
that pretty man help me?

780
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:27,255
Dolomite was trying
to get in your panties.

781
00:36:27,288 --> 00:36:29,156
- We don't need his money.
- No.

782
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:31,693
<i>We</i> don't need the money.
<i>I</i> need the money, Dad.

783
00:36:31,726 --> 00:36:34,362
I just want to get my education,
so I don't end up like you.

784
00:36:34,396 --> 00:36:35,597
- Like me?
- Yes, Daddy.

785
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,064
Just write the book
or get a job.

786
00:36:37,097 --> 00:36:38,366
Get a job,
broke nigga!

787
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,167
I got some money
on your hair, Freezee.

788
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,035
I'm about to unthaw yo ass.

789
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:43,638
- I'm leaving.
- Allie.

790
00:36:43,671 --> 00:36:45,407
And me and Freezee are gonna
live happily ever after together.

791
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,040
- Allie Black.
- That is what we're doing.

792
00:36:47,074 --> 00:36:48,443
- Freezee! Let's go!
- Allie Black.

793
00:36:48,476 --> 00:36:49,943
Allie! Allie!

794
00:36:49,977 --> 00:36:51,212
I think she just called
you a dumbass.

795
00:36:51,246 --> 00:36:52,347
Stop yelling
in the neighborhood!

796
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,181
- Allie.
- We're going.

797
00:36:54,215 --> 00:36:56,217
- Baby, tuck my legs in.
- I got you.

798
00:36:57,318 --> 00:36:59,086
- Baby.
- Look at that.

799
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,622
Always falling like this.

800
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:02,424
Carl!

801
00:37:02,457 --> 00:37:04,726
Why is she leaving like that, baby?
We just talked about this.

802
00:37:04,759 --> 00:37:06,694
- Baby, I...
- Well-well, the neighbor next door

803
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:08,996
tried to give some goddamn
vampire pimp money

804
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:11,399
to Allie for school
and goddamn hatin' ass Carl,

805
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:14,269
he gon' take the money and throw
it back in the goddamn vampire face

806
00:37:14,302 --> 00:37:15,670
and goddamn Allie,
goddamn...

807
00:37:15,703 --> 00:37:19,039
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
calm down, little infant!

808
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:21,108
Vampire?
Vampire pimp?

809
00:37:21,141 --> 00:37:23,378
That's what you guys are out
here talking about right now?

810
00:37:23,411 --> 00:37:25,979
- No. It ain't even like that.
- We just had this conversation.

811
00:37:26,013 --> 00:37:28,683
- Hey.
- I'm tired of all this craziness.

812
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:30,685
Did you call the real estate
agent like I asked you to?

813
00:37:30,718 --> 00:37:33,688
Called the real estate agent.
I... I left a message for him.

814
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:36,558
Look, Carl, I'll call him,
just like I do

815
00:37:36,591 --> 00:37:38,693
- everything else around here, okay?
- Oh-oh.

816
00:37:38,726 --> 00:37:41,429
But you know what, we need to talk
tonight when I get home from work.

817
00:37:41,463 --> 00:37:43,298
Oh-oh.

818
00:37:43,331 --> 00:37:45,300
- Babe, don't do that.
- I gotta go to work.

819
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:47,034
- She's gonna cheat on you.
- Shut up, Cronut.

820
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:48,168
It's me, baby.

821
00:37:48,203 --> 00:37:49,537
- Yeah.
- Babe.

822
00:37:50,738 --> 00:37:53,208
Yeah, she gonna cheat on you.

823
00:37:54,609 --> 00:37:56,244
I'm gonna cheat on you.

824
00:37:56,277 --> 00:37:58,546
Carl. Carl.

825
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,316
Carl!

826
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:03,183
- Carl!
- What?

827
00:38:03,218 --> 00:38:05,118
Gotta listen to me.
You gotta hear me out for real.

828
00:38:05,152 --> 00:38:07,120
I know you're going
through a lot.

829
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:09,357
I know your old lady trippin',
I know your daughter trippin',

830
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,658
I know you have
a writer's block,

831
00:38:10,692 --> 00:38:12,594
but please, bro,
just listen to me.

832
00:38:12,627 --> 00:38:15,663
Go home. All right?
It's over.

833
00:38:15,697 --> 00:38:17,432
I'm movin' the fuck
out of this house.

834
00:38:17,465 --> 00:38:19,501
This our house!
We can't let him move us out.

835
00:38:19,534 --> 00:38:21,669
- I don't wannna hear that shit.
- I gotta tell you this for real.

836
00:38:21,703 --> 00:38:24,606
Guess what I found while you
was talking to the pimp vampire?

837
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,741
These Rico glasses, man.
They probably got him.

838
00:38:26,774 --> 00:38:29,410
They done... they done drunk all
his blood and everything, man.

839
00:38:29,444 --> 00:38:31,713
Stop! That motherfucker
just tried to play me.

840
00:38:31,746 --> 00:38:33,146
He's going to jail.

841
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,383
Three hots and a cot,
he's going to jail.

842
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:37,485
So, what you
gonna do about it?

843
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:39,554
The little motherfucker's going to jail
for pimping and pandering around here.

844
00:38:39,587 --> 00:38:41,121
What you mean,
what I'm gonna do?

845
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:44,124
Police ain't never arrestin'
no goddamn vampire.

846
00:38:44,157 --> 00:38:45,827
That's shit, okay?

847
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,263
Did you see he floated down the stairs?

848
00:38:48,296 --> 00:38:49,731
You didn't see him float?

849
00:38:49,764 --> 00:38:51,566
<i>911,
what's your emergency?</i>

850
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,668
Yes, I have
a problem here.

851
00:38:53,701 --> 00:38:56,337
Um,
I'm a new neighbor

852
00:38:56,371 --> 00:38:58,306
that just moved
in the neighborhood.

853
00:38:58,339 --> 00:39:00,241
As you can tell,
I'm Caucasian.

854
00:39:00,275 --> 00:39:02,777
And there's
a real peculiar guy.

855
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,779
- <i>Is he Black? Okay.</i>
- Yes, he's Black.

856
00:39:04,812 --> 00:39:06,347
<i>We'll send over
five units right away.</i>

857
00:39:06,381 --> 00:39:07,782
Okay, you'll be here
in a second?

858
00:39:07,815 --> 00:39:09,851
- <i>Right away.</i>
- Thank you.

859
00:39:09,884 --> 00:39:13,221
That's how you do that.

860
00:39:13,254 --> 00:39:14,589
He's going to jail.

861
00:39:24,465 --> 00:39:26,334
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, fall back, fall back.

862
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:28,336
- What's going on?
- I'm the lead cop on this.

863
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:30,538
- Laced, you're a rookie.
- Listen, I'm just tryin' to have some fun.

864
00:39:30,572 --> 00:39:32,607
I said
fall back, man.

865
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,375
Listen, I got my gun.
I'm going to this house to have some fun.

866
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:35,643
Do my thing.

867
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:39,681
All right. Go ahead.
Handle this.

868
00:39:39,714 --> 00:39:41,382
What kind of spooky shit
is this?

869
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:44,218
First time bein' a cop.
This is gonna be a breeze.

870
00:39:44,252 --> 00:39:46,287
That like a old couple
relationship.

871
00:39:52,327 --> 00:39:53,695
Come on out of there

872
00:39:53,728 --> 00:39:55,630
- before I put a hot one in your ass!
- Hold on.

873
00:39:55,663 --> 00:39:56,898
There'll be no gun violence.
Put your gun down. This is my first day.

874
00:39:56,931 --> 00:39:58,633
Shut up and stop
being a little bitch.

875
00:40:03,338 --> 00:40:05,473
Two of them in up
there, weird as hell.

876
00:40:05,506 --> 00:40:07,408
Lock his ass up.

877
00:40:07,442 --> 00:40:08,543
He got Rico.

878
00:40:11,346 --> 00:40:14,549
- Police.
- Good heavens! What is all the fuss?

879
00:40:14,582 --> 00:40:17,785
Oh, a father
and son team, splendid.

880
00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:19,854
What may I do for you,
dark-skinned Hutch?

881
00:40:19,887 --> 00:40:22,624
Listen, big fella.
Dude down there saying y'all been involved

882
00:40:22,657 --> 00:40:24,792
in the kidnappin' of the
neighborhood watch captain?

883
00:40:24,826 --> 00:40:26,159
Rico.

884
00:40:26,193 --> 00:40:27,495
- So y'all kidnap him?
- Yeah.

885
00:40:27,528 --> 00:40:28,696
And I heard you got hoes
all up in through there.

886
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:29,864
Y'all freaky-freaky, huh?

887
00:40:29,897 --> 00:40:31,499
Not at all, sir.

888
00:40:31,532 --> 00:40:33,835
This is the residence
of Dr. Mamuwalde.

889
00:40:33,868 --> 00:40:36,604
- Mama-who?
- <i>Can't a man pimp in peace?</i>

890
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:40,875
The name is
Dr. Mamuwalde.

891
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,379
- Shit.
- He trippin'-trippin'.

892
00:40:44,412 --> 00:40:46,280
I hope they get
his ass, man.

893
00:40:46,314 --> 00:40:47,949
Listen, big fella,
do you mind if I have a look inside,

894
00:40:47,982 --> 00:40:49,584
see what's going on
see what I can steal?

895
00:40:49,617 --> 00:40:51,352
I mean, just see what's
going on in the house.

896
00:40:51,386 --> 00:40:54,589
Absolutely. My house
is your house, officer.

897
00:40:54,622 --> 00:40:56,391
Feel free to look around

898
00:40:56,424 --> 00:40:59,661
- as soon as you present your warrant.
- He trippin'.

899
00:40:59,694 --> 00:41:01,462
- Warrant?
- Yes, warrant.

900
00:41:01,496 --> 00:41:04,298
What the fuck? You 'posed to
be an expert on the law now?

901
00:41:04,332 --> 00:41:07,301
I'm gonna show you what we do
with experts down here, hm?

902
00:41:07,335 --> 00:41:08,703
Hold on, what you doing?

903
00:41:08,736 --> 00:41:10,772
No! Put the taser off!
Put the taser off!

904
00:41:10,805 --> 00:41:13,474
- You trippin'-trippin'.
- Uh-huh, bust him. Bust him.

905
00:41:13,508 --> 00:41:15,710
- Put your taser off.
- Don't eyeball me, boy.

906
00:41:15,743 --> 00:41:17,412
Don't play with me.

907
00:41:17,445 --> 00:41:18,846
We just want to know if you
know about the whereabouts

908
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,349
of this Rico guy.
Where is Rico?

909
00:41:21,382 --> 00:41:24,652
You're the one supposed
to be looking

910
00:41:24,686 --> 00:41:27,555
for whoever you're
looking for, sir.

911
00:41:27,588 --> 00:41:30,792
I don't know who Rico is
and you can't make me.

912
00:41:30,825 --> 00:41:32,326
He's lying, man.

913
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,961
How y'all gonna believe

914
00:41:33,995 --> 00:41:36,931
somebody dressed like
Dr. Seuss is what I'm sayin'?

915
00:41:36,964 --> 00:41:38,933
What do you do, sir?
For a living?

916
00:41:38,966 --> 00:41:42,770
Well, for a living,
I take fantasy and dreams

917
00:41:42,804 --> 00:41:45,840
and I make them
into reality.

918
00:41:45,873 --> 00:41:49,343
Let me tell you something,
creepy motherfucker. You got two options.

919
00:41:49,377 --> 00:41:53,514
Option A, we look around
inside this spooky motherfucker,

920
00:41:53,548 --> 00:41:55,817
or option B, we're gonna
arrest your ass,

921
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:58,319
take you down to the precinct,
ask you a bunch of goddamn questions.

922
00:41:58,352 --> 00:42:00,855
He's going to jail. That's
what I'm talking about.

923
00:42:00,888 --> 00:42:03,324
I'll take... I haven't even
chosen my options.

924
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:04,959
Oh, we're gonna do it.
We're gonna take him now.

925
00:42:04,992 --> 00:42:07,562
Option A, I don't.
Option B...

926
00:42:07,595 --> 00:42:08,930
We're gonna take
you downtown, Midnite.

927
00:42:08,963 --> 00:42:10,665
Wait a minute.

928
00:42:10,698 --> 00:42:13,701
How can you call me "midnight"
as dark as you are...

929
00:42:13,735 --> 00:42:16,270
- What? What did you say?
- ...ith all due respect, officer?

930
00:42:16,304 --> 00:42:19,307
Well, if I'm Midnight,
aren't you two Nights?

931
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,375
There ain't shit you're gonna do about it.
Come on with your little...

932
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:22,910
- Stop resisting.
- They're taking him to jail.

933
00:42:22,944 --> 00:42:24,946
That's what I'm talking about.
Do your job.

934
00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:27,381
This is definitely
Black on Black crime.

935
00:42:27,415 --> 00:42:29,517
Hey, I got it.
Take his Black ass down.

936
00:42:42,697 --> 00:42:44,031
Officer!

937
00:42:44,065 --> 00:42:45,900
I believe there's been
a misunderstanding.

938
00:42:48,035 --> 00:42:49,771
Do you mean this Rico?

939
00:42:55,042 --> 00:42:57,445
Rico, what the fuck
you doing in there?

940
00:42:57,478 --> 00:43:00,648
I'm fine. I was just
in the basement...

941
00:43:00,681 --> 00:43:02,450
They didn't fondle with you
down there, did they?

942
00:43:02,483 --> 00:43:03,851
They did me fine.

943
00:43:03,885 --> 00:43:06,954
- They served me fresh bananas.
- From Honduras.

944
00:43:06,988 --> 00:43:08,422
Bananas in the basement?

945
00:43:08,456 --> 00:43:10,091
They done brainwashed
his crazy ass.

946
00:43:10,124 --> 00:43:11,492
They did more
than brainwashing.

947
00:43:11,526 --> 00:43:13,427
Somethin' ain't
right with him.

948
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:29,977
<i>Come to me, Lorena.</i>

949
00:43:37,885 --> 00:43:40,488
<i>Come to me, Lorena.</i>

950
00:43:41,622 --> 00:43:43,958
<i>I've been searching for you.</i>

951
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:51,599
<i>Are you feeling my breath
upon your corpuscle?</i>

952
00:44:01,943 --> 00:44:03,778
What kind
of cop shit is this?

953
00:44:03,811 --> 00:44:05,112
Y'all let him go?

954
00:44:05,146 --> 00:44:07,682
Mr. Black, you call us
down here again

955
00:44:07,715 --> 00:44:08,950
and waste our damn time,

956
00:44:08,983 --> 00:44:11,552
I'm gonna take
your ashy ass to jail.

957
00:44:11,586 --> 00:44:13,087
We cop cops.
This ain't no damn joke!

958
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,590
Man, if you don't get
your retarded ass...

959
00:44:15,623 --> 00:44:18,960
You better watch your mouth, before I
stick these goddamn handcuffs up your ass.

960
00:44:18,993 --> 00:44:21,095
Don't eyeball me, boy.

961
00:44:21,128 --> 00:44:22,964
Let's go.

962
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:27,735
Carl, why are you
here with the police?

963
00:44:27,768 --> 00:44:29,570
What did the neighbor
do to you?

964
00:44:29,604 --> 00:44:32,006
This is what happens when you
keep messing with the neighbors.

965
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:33,608
Why are you blamin'
him for everything?

966
00:44:33,641 --> 00:44:35,543
Because clearly, I see
you out here too.

967
00:44:35,576 --> 00:44:37,745
For real, this is your plan.
Don't try to put this on me.

968
00:44:37,778 --> 00:44:39,614
- We're movin' out.
- What do you mean? Wait!

969
00:44:39,647 --> 00:44:41,449
- Without you.
- How you gonna move out without me?

970
00:44:41,482 --> 00:44:42,984
- We family.
- No. We not family.

971
00:44:43,017 --> 00:44:44,886
You're just my cousin
that fucks up everything.

972
00:44:44,919 --> 00:44:46,053
- That's family.
- You know what?

973
00:44:46,087 --> 00:44:48,422
I'm tired of you
always blamin' him.

974
00:44:48,456 --> 00:44:50,758
Look right here. This is what it's
about, me and you. You're messing up.

975
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:00,935
- Babe. I can explain.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

976
00:45:00,968 --> 00:45:04,472
The motherfucker was trying to
disrespect me in front of my daughter.

977
00:45:04,505 --> 00:45:06,874
I'm tired of you
embarrassing our family.

978
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:10,478
You owe that man
an apology.

979
00:45:10,511 --> 00:45:12,013
Babe...

980
00:45:13,648 --> 00:45:16,083
I don't know
if this is it for us.

981
00:45:16,117 --> 00:45:19,921
I used to think it was the house,
the neighborhood, your book.

982
00:45:19,954 --> 00:45:22,590
But it's not.

983
00:45:22,623 --> 00:45:25,192
It's you.

984
00:45:25,227 --> 00:45:26,994
It's you and I
that don't work.

985
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:36,137
I got to go back to work.
So you figure that out.

986
00:45:37,972 --> 00:45:41,475
I'll apologize.
I'll go apologize.

987
00:45:41,509 --> 00:45:44,912
I don't have a problem
apologizing to him.

988
00:45:44,946 --> 00:45:47,581
<i>Attack and bring me my wife.</i>

989
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:51,185
Right this
way, Mr. Black.

990
00:45:51,219 --> 00:45:53,654
The good doctor'll be here
to deal with you shortly.

991
00:45:53,688 --> 00:45:55,723
Hey, man. Did you
just change your accent?

992
00:45:55,756 --> 00:45:58,893
Where'd he go? What the fuck
was he saying?

993
00:46:00,728 --> 00:46:02,830
Wow.

994
00:46:02,863 --> 00:46:04,065
It's nice, though.

995
00:46:07,568 --> 00:46:08,836
- Carl Black.
- Hey!

996
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:11,706
What the fuck!
Jesus, Buddha, Allah!

997
00:46:13,241 --> 00:46:15,543
Is every place in here creepy?

998
00:46:15,576 --> 00:46:18,246
I thought I smelled
failure in here.

999
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:22,683
And I thought I smelled Celine
Dion's wig also in here.

1000
00:46:22,717 --> 00:46:25,119
You're a funny
motherfucker, Carl.

1001
00:46:25,152 --> 00:46:28,756
And I don't just mean that
dumb expression on your face.

1002
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:32,294
Yeah? Well, look,
let me be straight up with you, all right?

1003
00:46:32,327 --> 00:46:33,861
- Thank you.
- I don't like you.

1004
00:46:33,894 --> 00:46:35,062
First time I seen you,

1005
00:46:35,096 --> 00:46:37,299
- just didn't like you.
- Okay.

1006
00:46:37,332 --> 00:46:41,569
My wife sent me over here to apologize
to you and that's what I want to do.

1007
00:46:41,602 --> 00:46:44,071
I want to apologize,
but I just want to let you know,

1008
00:46:44,105 --> 00:46:46,574
I don't give a fuck.

1009
00:46:46,607 --> 00:46:47,942
We getting the fuck out
of this neighborhood.

1010
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:50,578
Well, that's very
interesting, Green Lantern,

1011
00:46:50,611 --> 00:46:52,747
but you can't leave
just yet.

1012
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,249
Oh, yes, I can! Shit!

1013
00:46:54,282 --> 00:46:55,750
My lease is up next month.

1014
00:46:57,952 --> 00:46:59,053
What's this?

1015
00:46:59,086 --> 00:47:00,955
There's something
I want from you

1016
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:03,124
and you're not
leaving until I get it.

1017
00:47:03,157 --> 00:47:06,060
Man, I hope it's my nuts
for these girls.

1018
00:47:06,093 --> 00:47:07,628
No!

1019
00:47:09,297 --> 00:47:12,867
My book.
You like my book?

1020
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,102
I told you I was a fan
of your book.

1021
00:47:15,136 --> 00:47:17,571
- That is crazy.
- It was magnificent.

1022
00:47:17,605 --> 00:47:18,773
You like my book.

1023
00:47:18,806 --> 00:47:20,875
I like you
and your family, Carl.

1024
00:47:20,908 --> 00:47:22,109
And not everybody
in my family

1025
00:47:22,143 --> 00:47:24,145
agreed with you moving in
next door to us.

1026
00:47:24,178 --> 00:47:25,880
Your wife.

1027
00:47:25,913 --> 00:47:28,182
My wife? Lorena?

1028
00:47:28,216 --> 00:47:29,784
Lorena.

1029
00:47:29,817 --> 00:47:32,953
Oh, no. She ain't...
she ain't into no pimping shit.

1030
00:47:32,987 --> 00:47:35,257
She ain't into no pimping shit
and I ain't either, okay?

1031
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:36,957
Tried it, didn't like it.

1032
00:47:36,991 --> 00:47:41,095
And my daughter?
That's off limits.

1033
00:47:41,128 --> 00:47:43,864
You're too grown to be messing
with anybody's daughter.

1034
00:47:43,898 --> 00:47:45,833
Ain't no man gonna let you
mess with they daughter.

1035
00:47:45,866 --> 00:47:49,036
She's still a little girl.
She's still doing Juicy Juices.

1036
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:51,806
She's not a grown lady.
She don't know what YAK is,

1037
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,741
nor does she know
what Gray Goose is.

1038
00:47:53,774 --> 00:47:57,312
I had no idea how old she was.
She was my size.

1039
00:47:57,345 --> 00:47:59,814
Keep your little
one, two, three, four, five,

1040
00:47:59,847 --> 00:48:03,385
six, seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven, twelve fingers

1041
00:48:03,418 --> 00:48:05,719
away from my daughter,
blah-blah.

1042
00:48:05,753 --> 00:48:06,954
Big mistake.

1043
00:48:06,987 --> 00:48:08,290
Don't fuck with my daughter.

1044
00:48:08,323 --> 00:48:10,758
And Cronut,
he's a character.

1045
00:48:10,791 --> 00:48:12,660
Oh, Cronut?
You can have him.

1046
00:48:12,693 --> 00:48:15,963
Ugh. No one wants Cronut.

1047
00:48:15,996 --> 00:48:17,299
You can fuck him
if you want.

1048
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:21,303
He's crazy.
He's the one that think

1049
00:48:21,336 --> 00:48:25,039
Michael Jackson and Biggie
and Tupac is still living,

1050
00:48:25,072 --> 00:48:27,708
and-and thinks O.J.
didn't do it.

1051
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:29,344
He's got a whole lot
of shit in his head.

1052
00:48:29,377 --> 00:48:32,214
And he gave me some crazy
theories about you too.

1053
00:48:32,247 --> 00:48:35,983
I'mma go ahead and sign this autograph
'fore I can get on out of here.

1054
00:48:38,052 --> 00:48:40,955
And what was his theory
about me?

1055
00:48:40,988 --> 00:48:44,792
We still don't know why you
moved in the neighborhood...

1056
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:05,347
What the fuck!
What's wrong with you?

1057
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:08,383
Egad, Carl Black.

1058
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:11,051
Do I detect hostility
in your voice?

1059
00:49:11,085 --> 00:49:12,720
I thought we were cool now.

1060
00:49:12,753 --> 00:49:14,021
No, we're not cool!

1061
00:49:14,054 --> 00:49:17,925
And you do detect
hostility in my voice.

1062
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:20,395
You got a picture of my wife
naked on your fucking wall!

1063
00:49:20,428 --> 00:49:22,364
I ain't even got
a picture of this bitch.

1064
00:49:22,397 --> 00:49:24,698
- Did you photoshop the picture?
- No.

1065
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:27,302
No, that's her.

1066
00:49:27,335 --> 00:49:31,406
I bet I know what Cronut
thinks about me.

1067
00:49:31,439 --> 00:49:33,974
You know what?

1068
00:49:34,008 --> 00:49:37,412
<i>He was right.</i>

1069
00:50:00,402 --> 00:50:02,237
What are you doing?

1070
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:04,004
Be quiet.
I know what I'm doing.

1071
00:50:04,038 --> 00:50:05,839
Would you...
Dad, come on.

1072
00:50:05,873 --> 00:50:07,942
Son, I got something
I need to talk to you about.

1073
00:50:07,975 --> 00:50:09,743
All right.

1074
00:50:09,777 --> 00:50:12,146
We got a vampire living next door!
I've seen him!

1075
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:15,115
- Hey, that's cool!
- I think I've seen that dude.

1076
00:50:15,149 --> 00:50:16,884
What's so...
What the fuck is wrong...

1077
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:18,286
What's cool about that?

1078
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,055
Dad, Dad, just relax.
Just call the cops.

1079
00:50:21,088 --> 00:50:22,390
I can't call the cops.

1080
00:50:22,424 --> 00:50:24,259
Okay, everybody knows
the vampire rules.

1081
00:50:24,292 --> 00:50:26,060
Like, a vampire
cannot come in your house

1082
00:50:26,093 --> 00:50:28,496
unless you invite him in.
Did you invite him in?

1083
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:30,298
- No. I didn't invite him in.
- All right.

1084
00:50:30,332 --> 00:50:31,865
All right, then you're good.
That's good.

1085
00:50:31,899 --> 00:50:33,235
- I'm cool. Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1086
00:50:33,268 --> 00:50:34,835
Come on now.
Everybody knows that.

1087
00:50:34,868 --> 00:50:36,371
It's in literally
every vampire comic book.

1088
00:50:36,404 --> 00:50:37,472
Every one.

1089
00:50:37,505 --> 00:50:41,108
Oh, man.
You got some weed?

1090
00:50:41,141 --> 00:50:42,977
Dad, what?
Just leave. Just leave.

1091
00:50:44,212 --> 00:50:45,913
I know who got it.

1092
00:50:45,946 --> 00:50:47,948
No, he doesn't. He's kidding.
Bro, shut up.

1093
00:50:47,982 --> 00:50:49,451
- A dime bag? Twenty?
- No, no. Leave. Leave. He's kidding.

1094
00:50:49,484 --> 00:50:51,952
He's kidding. He's kidding.
Go take a nap.

1095
00:50:51,986 --> 00:50:54,222
- But I do.
- Just be quiet. Just stop.

1096
00:51:03,465 --> 00:51:05,799
I'm gonna watch you
all night, motherfucker.

1097
00:51:36,598 --> 00:51:39,099
Don't invite him in.

1098
00:51:47,542 --> 00:51:49,444
Oh, shit.

1099
00:51:55,115 --> 00:51:56,284
Give me your money.

1100
00:51:56,318 --> 00:51:57,951
Please don't hurt me.

1101
00:51:57,985 --> 00:51:59,321
Please don't hurt...

1102
00:52:23,977 --> 00:52:26,013
Hi, Carl.

1103
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:34,356
<i>No.</i>

1104
00:52:35,623 --> 00:52:37,459
<i>No.
I'm being serious.</i>

1105
00:52:37,492 --> 00:52:41,363
I'm telling you, it's been an
interesting week and I apologize.

1106
00:52:41,396 --> 00:52:44,432
I feel the timing of it all
is pretty, um, special,

1107
00:52:44,466 --> 00:52:48,135
that you would... I don't know where
you came from, but I appreciate it.

1108
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:51,406
And I think it's important
that we met tonight

1109
00:52:51,439 --> 00:52:53,575
because I wanted to really
apologize for the other night.

1110
00:52:53,608 --> 00:52:56,244
I know my husband
was in there tonight.

1111
00:52:56,277 --> 00:52:58,912
Is everything okay?
Mamuwalde, right?

1112
00:52:58,946 --> 00:53:01,915
I have to, um, really
get this out,

1113
00:53:01,949 --> 00:53:05,353
because I feel like I'm having a little
bit of an out-of-body experience,

1114
00:53:05,387 --> 00:53:09,324
because I typically don't invite
complete strangers into my house

1115
00:53:09,357 --> 00:53:12,594
to have a glass of wine.
In this case...

1116
00:53:12,627 --> 00:53:14,529
<i>Don't invite him in.</i>

1117
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:21,135
- Hey.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.

1118
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:24,539
What you doing?

1119
00:53:24,572 --> 00:53:26,307
Baby, hi.
Hi. Were you sleeping?

1120
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:29,444
What is he doing here?
He's not supposed to be here.

1121
00:53:29,477 --> 00:53:32,347
Where are your manners, baby?
This is Dr. Mamuwalde.

1122
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,482
- Our neighbor from earlier...
- I know what you doing!

1123
00:53:34,516 --> 00:53:36,351
Yes, where are
your manners, baby?

1124
00:53:36,384 --> 00:53:38,319
He's not supposed
to be in this house.

1125
00:53:38,353 --> 00:53:40,187
I invited him to have
a glass of wine with me

1126
00:53:40,221 --> 00:53:41,955
because if anything,
we owe him a thank you.

1127
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:43,625
- I don't wanna hear all that.
- If it wasn't for our neighbor,

1128
00:53:43,658 --> 00:53:45,226
I would have gotten
mugged tonight.

1129
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:47,362
You got mugged?

1130
00:53:47,395 --> 00:53:49,029
He swooped... Where did you come from?
Where? How did you get there?

1131
00:53:49,062 --> 00:53:51,332
- Swooped.
- What happened?

1132
00:53:51,366 --> 00:53:55,270
Fortunately for you, I happened to be in
the area looking for a late-night snack

1133
00:53:55,303 --> 00:53:59,207
and happened to stumble
upon your tastiness.

1134
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,675
He's not supposed
to be in our home.

1135
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:03,010
He was not invited by no one.

1136
00:54:03,043 --> 00:54:05,078
Under ordinary circumstances,

1137
00:54:05,112 --> 00:54:07,282
Carl Black here
would be right,

1138
00:54:07,315 --> 00:54:10,150
- but I <i>was</i> invited, Carl.
- You know the rules.

1139
00:54:10,184 --> 00:54:12,687
- His kind is not invited in our house.
- Listen...

1140
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,055
- My kind?
- Yeah.

1141
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:18,626
That is a racist
statement, Negro.

1142
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,728
I'll have you know,

1143
00:54:20,762 --> 00:54:24,699
in this age of divisiveness
and bigotry,

1144
00:54:24,732 --> 00:54:27,201
we can't do this
to each other.

1145
00:54:28,369 --> 00:54:29,537
Sheesh!

1146
00:54:29,571 --> 00:54:31,706
Yes. Baby, listen,
please just calm down.

1147
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:33,741
We got a real live
vampire in my house

1148
00:54:33,775 --> 00:54:35,276
and you're telling me
to calm down?

1149
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:37,579
If I had a wife as fine
as yours,

1150
00:54:37,612 --> 00:54:40,315
I'd never let her out
of my sight.

1151
00:54:40,348 --> 00:54:42,750
Hey, man! What-what-what
you doing? You can't do that, man.

1152
00:54:42,784 --> 00:54:44,486
What the fuck!
What if I grab your hair, man?

1153
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:48,188
<i>Do not...</i>

1154
00:54:48,223 --> 00:54:51,058
touch my hair,
Carl Black.

1155
00:54:51,091 --> 00:54:52,460
You got two Bo Derek braids

1156
00:54:52,494 --> 00:54:54,027
hanging on both
sides of your face

1157
00:54:54,061 --> 00:54:56,264
and you gon' touch
on my girl's shit.

1158
00:54:56,297 --> 00:54:58,533
Baby, just calm down, okay?

1159
00:54:58,566 --> 00:55:00,635
Okay, that's enough. That's enough.

1160
00:55:00,668 --> 00:55:02,737
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- What are you doing, Carl?

1161
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:04,506
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

1162
00:55:04,539 --> 00:55:06,608
- Ouch!
- You know I'm clumsy a little bit.

1163
00:55:28,161 --> 00:55:31,332
That looks
exquisitely painful.

1164
00:55:31,366 --> 00:55:33,535
Ah-ah-ah. Go in there
and rinse your arm off.

1165
00:55:33,568 --> 00:55:35,303
- I got it, Carl. I got it.
- Yeah, you cut your hand

1166
00:55:35,336 --> 00:55:37,705
'cause you're standing up there
reckless eyeballing.

1167
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:39,274
I got it.
Dr. Mamuwalde,

1168
00:55:39,307 --> 00:55:41,676
it was really,
really nice to meet you.

1169
00:55:41,709 --> 00:55:44,144
- Well, go wash your hand, baby. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Yeah, I'm...

1170
00:55:44,177 --> 00:55:45,313
Put a band-aid on it.

1171
00:55:45,346 --> 00:55:47,615
O-positive we'll see
each other again.

1172
00:55:47,649 --> 00:55:50,585
Listen, you little neglected
<i>Harry Potter</i> cast member,

1173
00:55:50,618 --> 00:55:52,520
let me tell you something.

1174
00:55:52,554 --> 00:55:55,757
That's my princess,
and that's my wife, and I love her.

1175
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:57,825
You're not going
to destroy my family!

1176
00:55:57,859 --> 00:56:01,161
What do you intend
to do about it, Carl Black?

1177
00:56:01,194 --> 00:56:03,498
Install my cable,
motherfucker?

1178
00:56:03,531 --> 00:56:05,366
Nah.

1179
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:10,170
I'm gonna pimp-slap the shit
out of your ass, motherfucker!

1180
00:56:13,274 --> 00:56:14,576
Damn, you're strong!

1181
00:56:14,609 --> 00:56:18,379
Let me tell you
a little story.

1182
00:56:20,415 --> 00:56:24,352
<i>I've been looking
for Lorena for centuries.</i>

1183
00:56:24,385 --> 00:56:29,189
<i>I first laid eyes on that fine
young thing in the Caribbean.</i>

1184
00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:32,660
<i>Lost her, found her again.</i>

1185
00:56:32,694 --> 00:56:37,365
<i>I've seen all types of women
in all shapes and sizes,</i>

1186
00:56:37,398 --> 00:56:41,536
<i>but none compare
to the governor's daughter.</i>

1187
00:56:41,569 --> 00:56:43,271
<i>We were in love</i>

1188
00:56:43,304 --> 00:56:46,474
<i>and I was finally
going to make her mine.</i>

1189
00:56:59,787 --> 00:57:02,690
You were warned, vampire.

1190
00:57:03,558 --> 00:57:08,563
Tonight's the night
that I send your soul to hell!

1191
00:57:08,596 --> 00:57:10,565
Demon!

1192
00:57:10,598 --> 00:57:13,301
Come, woman.

1193
00:57:13,334 --> 00:57:15,570
No. No. No!

1194
00:57:15,603 --> 00:57:18,573
<i>They took the love
of my life from me</i>

1195
00:57:18,606 --> 00:57:22,777
<i>and I have been looking for my
Puerto Rican princess ever since.</i>

1196
00:57:26,814 --> 00:57:30,284
Go to hell, vampire.

1197
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:36,791
<i>They took my life.</i>

1198
00:57:39,527 --> 00:57:41,462
Man, that was a cool story!

1199
00:57:41,496 --> 00:57:46,234
But the real fact is,
is that's my wife, and I love her.

1200
00:57:46,267 --> 00:57:47,835
And you're not gonna
destroy my family.

1201
00:57:47,869 --> 00:57:51,439
You're doing a pretty
good job of that yourself.

1202
00:57:51,472 --> 00:57:52,874
What the fuck?

1203
00:57:52,907 --> 00:57:54,809
She will be mine.

1204
00:57:58,246 --> 00:58:00,581
No, no!

1205
00:58:01,883 --> 00:58:03,451
<i>Mine...</i>

1206
00:58:03,484 --> 00:58:04,952
Carl Black!

1207
00:58:13,961 --> 00:58:16,898
<i>The authorities
are still in shambles</i>

1208
00:58:16,931 --> 00:58:19,233
<i>as they scurry about for clues</i>

1209
00:58:19,267 --> 00:58:22,303
- <i>in the murders of these prostitutes.</i>
- Wow.

1210
00:58:22,336 --> 00:58:25,673
<i>If anyone out there has any
information or any leads...</i>

1211
00:58:25,707 --> 00:58:27,675
- Damn.
- <i>...feel free</i>

1212
00:58:27,709 --> 00:58:30,712
<i>to DM me personally at jack...</i>

1213
00:58:30,745 --> 00:58:33,281
Hey, babe. Hey, hey.

1214
00:58:33,314 --> 00:58:35,650
- How's your arm?
- It's better. It's feeling good.

1215
00:58:35,683 --> 00:58:37,785
- I gotta go to work. What?
- No!

1216
00:58:37,819 --> 00:58:39,287
- Why you gotta go to work?
- Because you put me in this situation.

1217
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,521
I got to go to work
to pay the bills.

1218
00:58:40,555 --> 00:58:42,924
Let me pay you
for the night.

1219
00:58:42,957 --> 00:58:45,326
You can't afford me
for the night.

1220
00:58:46,594 --> 00:58:48,763
- Listen, I love you.
- I know.

1221
00:58:48,796 --> 00:58:50,865
I-I just want to get you guys
out of this neighborhood.

1222
00:58:50,898 --> 00:58:53,301
Okay. Wait, wait,
call me crazy.

1223
00:58:53,334 --> 00:58:55,536
I-I'm just throwing
this out there.

1224
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:58,005
I'm having second thoughts
about selling the house.

1225
00:58:58,039 --> 00:58:59,707
- What?
- I don't know,

1226
00:58:59,741 --> 00:59:01,743
ever since I met
the neighbor last night,

1227
00:59:01,776 --> 00:59:05,046
- the way that he was helping me or the way that he...
- Hey, hey.

1228
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:08,516
- No, but maybe it's not such a bad neighborhood, babe.
- No, no, no, no, no. No!

1229
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:10,485
- Wait, wait. He's a nice guy.
- Baby, listen. No! That... no.

1230
00:59:10,518 --> 00:59:12,854
He's not no fucking nice...
what did I tell you about liking people?

1231
00:59:12,887 --> 00:59:14,956
- Liking?
- You always liking somebody.

1232
00:59:14,989 --> 00:59:17,291
- No! Hey!
- He saved me.

1233
00:59:17,325 --> 00:59:18,826
Relax. Let's put
this to rest

1234
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:20,528
until I come home
from work tonight, okay?

1235
00:59:20,561 --> 00:59:22,330
And we can talk
about it then.

1236
00:59:22,363 --> 00:59:24,799
- I got something I want to tell you.
- What?

1237
00:59:24,832 --> 00:59:26,434
The next-door neighbor...

1238
00:59:26,467 --> 00:59:28,002
- Yeah?
- He's a vampire.

1239
00:59:28,035 --> 00:59:29,537
A vampire.

1240
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,038
- He's a fucking vampire.
- Okay.

1241
00:59:31,072 --> 00:59:33,040
A vampire.
You're crazy.

1242
00:59:33,074 --> 00:59:34,308
You're just jealous.

1243
00:59:37,712 --> 00:59:40,815
Cronut, let me in.
There's a vampire living next door.

1244
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:57,365
Cronut?

1245
01:00:01,903 --> 01:00:02,870
Eww.

1246
01:00:09,076 --> 01:00:11,579
What's wrong with you?
Die, vampire!

1247
01:00:11,612 --> 01:00:14,482
- Die, vampire! Die!
- Let me go. Let me go. Let me go!

1248
01:00:14,515 --> 01:00:16,617
Get up off of me, man.

1249
01:00:16,651 --> 01:00:18,519
Fuck you doing in my house all uninvited?
I didn't invite you in here.

1250
01:00:18,553 --> 01:00:20,021
Why you sneaking up
on me like that?

1251
01:00:20,054 --> 01:00:22,490
Why am I sneaking up on you?
This is my house!

1252
01:00:22,523 --> 01:00:23,724
Fuck you doing
up in my house?

1253
01:00:23,758 --> 01:00:25,026
I thought you won't fuck
with me no more.

1254
01:00:25,059 --> 01:00:26,460
Whoa.

1255
01:00:26,494 --> 01:00:27,795
Why you got
them damn glasses on?

1256
01:00:27,829 --> 01:00:29,363
Why you care?
You don't like 'em?

1257
01:00:29,397 --> 01:00:30,631
They don't go
with my 'fit?

1258
01:00:30,665 --> 01:00:32,400
- No.
- What... what you want?

1259
01:00:32,433 --> 01:00:34,869
Shit. I, well, I just...

1260
01:00:34,902 --> 01:00:36,671
Hey, man, look.

1261
01:00:36,704 --> 01:00:38,406
All right.
You was right.

1262
01:00:38,439 --> 01:00:40,875
We do have a creature
living next door to us.

1263
01:00:40,908 --> 01:00:42,643
It's a real vampire, man.

1264
01:00:42,677 --> 01:00:43,978
I seen his teeth!

1265
01:00:44,011 --> 01:00:47,048
I thought you was lying
at first, but he's real.

1266
01:00:47,081 --> 01:00:49,884
And he already got Allie,
and I don't want him to get my wife!

1267
01:00:49,917 --> 01:00:51,686
And?

1268
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:54,455
And that's about the closest
to an apology you gon' get.

1269
01:00:54,488 --> 01:00:56,424
I've been
doing my research

1270
01:00:56,457 --> 01:00:58,059
and what I came up with?

1271
01:00:58,092 --> 01:00:59,827
That house right over there?

1272
01:00:59,861 --> 01:01:02,129
It's a master vampire over
there, and that's the nest.

1273
01:01:02,163 --> 01:01:03,631
And we should kill him.

1274
01:01:03,664 --> 01:01:05,867
- What?
- We should kill him.

1275
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:08,069
We, we.
That's French. We?

1276
01:01:08,102 --> 01:01:10,972
Yes, it is we.
Ain't no I in us.

1277
01:01:11,005 --> 01:01:14,542
It's we. Me and you.
We family.

1278
01:01:14,575 --> 01:01:16,777
Yeah.
Whatever.

1279
01:01:16,811 --> 01:01:18,646
We should kill
that motherfucker.

1280
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:20,514
Let's bury him
in the ground, man.

1281
01:01:20,548 --> 01:01:21,816
Just leave his head out

1282
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:23,818
and just kick him
in the head all day.

1283
01:01:23,851 --> 01:01:25,853
Check this out.
What's my name?

1284
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,922
- Cronut.
- No, what's my real name?

1285
01:01:27,955 --> 01:01:29,824
- Man, look, man. Stop playing.
- Mr. what?

1286
01:01:29,857 --> 01:01:31,626
- Mister?
- Mr. Right.

1287
01:01:31,659 --> 01:01:34,528
Mr. Right.
You want to get rid of the vampire?

1288
01:01:34,562 --> 01:01:37,465
- Yeah.
- Trust me. I made a call.

1289
01:01:40,668 --> 01:01:42,637
- Who is that? Is that Barack Obama?
- Trust me.

1290
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:44,906
Not quite,
but close.

1291
01:01:49,744 --> 01:01:50,645
Oooh.

1292
01:01:53,481 --> 01:01:57,818
Oh. Did you see that African
booty scratcher come out of there?

1293
01:01:57,852 --> 01:01:59,153
- Yes.
- No!

1294
01:01:59,186 --> 01:02:01,489
- Yes.
- Why'd you call him?

1295
01:02:01,522 --> 01:02:03,024
- Just trust me.
- Oh, man.

1296
01:02:03,057 --> 01:02:04,992
- Have I ever let you down?
- Yeah, a million times.

1297
01:02:05,026 --> 01:02:06,961
Don't worry about that.
That don't count.

1298
01:02:06,994 --> 01:02:09,130
- Oh, man. Look how he dressed.
- It looks crazy.

1299
01:02:09,163 --> 01:02:10,765
- Don't worry about it.
- Whoopi Goldberg.

1300
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:13,100
- You smell a vampire?
- Not yet, wait.

1301
01:02:13,134 --> 01:02:15,970
Right now,
I smell fear.

1302
01:02:16,003 --> 01:02:19,073
- Fear?
- And I smell broke-ass-ness

1303
01:02:19,106 --> 01:02:20,942
coming from this direction.

1304
01:02:20,975 --> 01:02:23,711
- Broke-ass-ness?
- No, you smell your bottom lip.

1305
01:02:23,744 --> 01:02:25,179
Last but not least,
I smell...

1306
01:02:27,982 --> 01:02:30,084
two bitch-ass niggas.

1307
01:02:30,117 --> 01:02:32,787
That's why you called me to
save you like I did the Purge.

1308
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:34,522
Saved me? You ain't
saved me from nothin'!

1309
01:02:34,555 --> 01:02:36,624
You better take
your Black ass off.

1310
01:02:36,657 --> 01:02:38,726
- Punk bitch nigga, you owe me money!
- I don't owe you nothin'.

1311
01:02:38,759 --> 01:02:40,962
You little dick bitch.
You pee on your boss.

1312
01:02:40,995 --> 01:02:43,597
- Fuck you too.
- I hope your wife get pregnant again

1313
01:02:43,631 --> 01:02:45,533
and I hope the baby
is not yours.

1314
01:02:45,566 --> 01:02:46,567
You kiss my ass!

1315
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,902
Your mother,
your grandfather,

1316
01:02:47,935 --> 01:02:49,804
your uncles are all
the same nigga.

1317
01:02:49,837 --> 01:02:51,572
I know you work
for that cab company.

1318
01:02:51,605 --> 01:02:53,275
You need to get back in there
and drive that cab, so...

1319
01:02:53,308 --> 01:02:54,942
- Carl Black, you owe me money!
- Hey, hey, hey.

1320
01:02:54,976 --> 01:02:56,944
Calm down, calm down. I got it.
I got it, calm down.

1321
01:02:56,978 --> 01:02:58,846
- This nigga is pissing me off.
- If you calm down a little

1322
01:02:58,879 --> 01:03:00,948
- for a second. Look...
- Don't you hit my head.

1323
01:03:00,982 --> 01:03:03,117
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey.

1324
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:05,753
Look, I promised him I'd show
him some crazy spooky shit

1325
01:03:05,786 --> 01:03:08,223
if I recorded it and put it
on his live TV show.

1326
01:03:08,256 --> 01:03:09,857
- On YouTube?
- Yeah.

1327
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:11,092
- You ain't got no followers.
- He's popular.

1328
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:13,228
Five hundred thousand
subscribers.

1329
01:03:13,261 --> 01:03:15,629
I got a live vampire
livin' next door to me.

1330
01:03:15,663 --> 01:03:16,597
That's what I got.

1331
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:18,099
Nigga,
that's why I'm here.

1332
01:03:18,132 --> 01:03:19,567
- That's why I brought these!
- Hey, hey!

1333
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,236
Put your leftovers down, man.

1334
01:03:21,269 --> 01:03:24,905
You must listen to me because
I am a vampire slayer.

1335
01:03:24,939 --> 01:03:26,941
The vampires
are very dangerous.

1336
01:03:26,974 --> 01:03:28,976
They will kill you.

1337
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:32,214
He will suck your blood.
He could be after your wife.

1338
01:03:32,247 --> 01:03:34,582
You have a wife. I know that.
I've seen her.

1339
01:03:34,615 --> 01:03:36,218
She have a nice ass.
No disrespect.

1340
01:03:36,251 --> 01:03:38,185
Tell me about these niggas,
please. What did he look like?

1341
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:40,187
He's bite-size,
he's real short.

1342
01:03:40,222 --> 01:03:41,722
How short is he?

1343
01:03:41,756 --> 01:03:43,691
He's short. He's... he's,
you know, he's...

1344
01:03:43,724 --> 01:03:45,192
Between you and this nigga,
where is he?

1345
01:03:45,227 --> 01:03:46,794
Like this way? This way?
That way? Under the table?

1346
01:03:46,827 --> 01:03:48,562
- Pocket size.
- Pocket size nigga?

1347
01:03:48,596 --> 01:03:50,131
He got like a little perm.

1348
01:03:50,164 --> 01:03:52,334
He looked like that
little man on the dime.

1349
01:03:52,367 --> 01:03:54,068
- What dime?
- The dime.

1350
01:03:54,101 --> 01:03:56,137
- The dime, motherfucker. The dime.
- Dime. Ten cents.

1351
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:57,938
Ten cents a day,
like what you eat.

1352
01:03:57,972 --> 01:03:59,940
Shut the fuck up, little bitch nigga.
Fuck you.

1353
01:03:59,974 --> 01:04:02,610
If I had a choice
between the vampires,

1354
01:04:02,643 --> 01:04:05,079
the devil and Donald Trump,

1355
01:04:05,112 --> 01:04:07,148
I would take Donald Trump.

1356
01:04:07,181 --> 01:04:10,985
The question is now he's trying
to take your family away,

1357
01:04:11,018 --> 01:04:13,087
- what are you are gonna do?
- Hey, hey, hey!

1358
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,257
We're not the vampire.
You don't have to keep putting that on us.

1359
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:18,192
Don't be a bitch!
If I want to talk to a little nigga,

1360
01:04:18,226 --> 01:04:19,827
I go to Chuck E. Cheese.

1361
01:04:21,662 --> 01:04:23,631
Either you gon' help me,
or you gon' help me,

1362
01:04:23,664 --> 01:04:24,899
somebody's gonna help me

1363
01:04:24,932 --> 01:04:26,234
or I'm going up in there
with a wooden thing

1364
01:04:26,268 --> 01:04:28,202
- and I'm gonna stab him in the...
- Mm.

1365
01:04:28,236 --> 01:04:31,306
I'm telling you! You know how...
I'm going up in there and...

1366
01:04:31,339 --> 01:04:33,074
Hey!

1367
01:04:33,107 --> 01:04:35,142
- You guys are crazier'n shit!
- Who the fuck is that?

1368
01:04:37,178 --> 01:04:39,680
Carl Black,
I'm all you have.

1369
01:04:39,713 --> 01:04:41,849
You must save your wife

1370
01:04:41,882 --> 01:04:43,684
<i>before it's too late.</i>

1371
01:05:05,739 --> 01:05:07,007
<i>Fellas, listen to me.</i>

1372
01:05:07,041 --> 01:05:09,910
The vampire is
very tricky and old.

1373
01:05:09,944 --> 01:05:13,914
It has survived many
centuries because he's smart.

1374
01:05:13,948 --> 01:05:17,352
Much smarter than your stupid
ignorant ass, Carl Black.

1375
01:05:17,385 --> 01:05:21,055
That insidious bastard
is a master vampire.

1376
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:22,957
A master vampire?

1377
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:27,094
He's not to be played with.
That means he has companions.

1378
01:05:27,128 --> 01:05:29,797
- Companions?
- We have a lot more to deal with.

1379
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:31,266
You have to get
to know your enemy.

1380
01:05:31,299 --> 01:05:32,833
I thought I knew him.

1381
01:05:32,867 --> 01:05:34,436
And how about his crew?
Do you know them?

1382
01:05:34,469 --> 01:05:37,205
His crew? What?
The butler?

1383
01:05:37,239 --> 01:05:40,841
Butler?! That's not a butler!
That's his ghoul!

1384
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:42,277
What is a ghoul?

1385
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:45,247
This is not the time
to be a bitch, Carl Black.

1386
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,882
A ghoul is very dangerous.

1387
01:05:47,915 --> 01:05:50,117
- What about those fine-ass girls he had in there?
- Yeah. They was fine.

1388
01:05:50,151 --> 01:05:52,254
- Cronut!
- I liked them.

1389
01:05:52,287 --> 01:05:55,723
Those are not
average fine-ass girls.

1390
01:05:55,756 --> 01:05:58,826
Those are his bodyguards.
They are murderous.

1391
01:05:58,859 --> 01:06:00,295
What?

1392
01:06:00,328 --> 01:06:02,830
The more beautiful they are,
the more dangerous.

1393
01:06:02,863 --> 01:06:05,300
This is getting more serious
than I imagined.

1394
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:07,968
What's this shit?
It was addressed to him.

1395
01:06:08,002 --> 01:06:09,937
He got a little chain on.
He got your same facial structure...

1396
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:12,307
Don't be a dick face.
Give me that.

1397
01:06:21,882 --> 01:06:24,319
It is nothing.
Just some stupid fucking doll.

1398
01:06:24,352 --> 01:06:26,153
- Put it away.
- Are you sure?

1399
01:06:26,187 --> 01:06:27,721
How we going to kill
this motherfucker?

1400
01:06:27,755 --> 01:06:29,391
- Dad. Dad. I got an idea.
- What?

1401
01:06:29,424 --> 01:06:31,825
I turned the Purge bats
into stakes.

1402
01:06:31,859 --> 01:06:33,928
If you stab a vampire
with it, it'll die.

1403
01:06:33,961 --> 01:06:37,265
Shut up!
This is why I'm here.

1404
01:06:37,299 --> 01:06:40,335
We have to kill the vampire!

1405
01:06:57,051 --> 01:06:59,887
Why you wipe my
kisses off like that?

1406
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,822
Baby, because you
put too much lip gloss on.

1407
01:07:01,855 --> 01:07:03,991
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do, and then my shit

1408
01:07:04,024 --> 01:07:05,859
- be all glittery for the rest of the day.
- Shut up. I do it for you

1409
01:07:05,893 --> 01:07:07,795
- when I'm around you. Whatever.
- Use Chapstick.

1410
01:07:07,828 --> 01:07:09,397
- You cute. You fine and all, baby.
- Whatever.

1411
01:07:09,431 --> 01:07:10,998
Give me a little bit
of head now.

1412
01:07:11,031 --> 01:07:12,199
- What?
- I'm just saying,

1413
01:07:12,234 --> 01:07:14,068
like, I wanna get
a little bit of head...

1414
01:07:14,101 --> 01:07:15,403
We're in front of my parents' house.
Are you serious?

1415
01:07:15,437 --> 01:07:17,104
Baby, they're sleeping
a little bit.

1416
01:07:17,137 --> 01:07:18,906
- Babe.
- Come on, baby.

1417
01:07:18,939 --> 01:07:20,508
- Just a little bit of head.
- Stop playing all the time.

1418
01:07:20,542 --> 01:07:22,776
- Baby, my-my legs. I'm-I'm paralyzed.
- Stop.

1419
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:25,179
That's the least you could
do, community service.

1420
01:07:25,213 --> 01:07:26,847
Let me get a little bit
of community head.

1421
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,182
Shut up. We need to talk.

1422
01:07:28,216 --> 01:07:29,551
Talk about what?
Baby, look,

1423
01:07:29,584 --> 01:07:31,486
talk with my dick in
your mouth a little bit.

1424
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:33,187
- I don't mean to be disrespectful.
- Wait, wait. Listen.

1425
01:07:33,221 --> 01:07:35,155
Listen to what?

1426
01:07:35,189 --> 01:07:37,024
- Baby.
- Did you hear that?

1427
01:07:37,057 --> 01:07:38,293
The only thing you
need to listen to is...

1428
01:07:38,326 --> 01:07:41,329
Listen!

1429
01:07:42,397 --> 01:07:43,531
The fuck was that?

1430
01:07:46,268 --> 01:07:48,902
Shit! Oh, shit!

1431
01:07:48,936 --> 01:07:50,372
- What is that?
- Ooh.

1432
01:07:50,405 --> 01:07:51,306
Oh, my God.

1433
01:07:53,907 --> 01:07:56,211
Freezee!
Freezee!

1434
01:07:56,244 --> 01:07:58,313
That was Allie.

1435
01:07:58,346 --> 01:07:59,913
Time to get the fuck out.

1436
01:08:02,149 --> 01:08:03,318
What just happened?

1437
01:08:03,351 --> 01:08:05,119
I don't know. I just
heard screams, man.

1438
01:08:05,152 --> 01:08:07,888
He made the first move.
He has taken your daughter.

1439
01:08:07,921 --> 01:08:09,591
It's all fucked up, man.

1440
01:08:09,624 --> 01:08:12,126
I didn't know they had Allie, too.
I like Allie! But there's more.

1441
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:14,061
- Well, tell us more.
- Yeah, you better say something

1442
01:08:14,094 --> 01:08:16,231
- before we take your banana bike, nigga.
- Come on now.

1443
01:08:16,264 --> 01:08:18,165
The vampires, man,
they got me.

1444
01:08:18,198 --> 01:08:19,967
See that house next door?

1445
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,238
They havin' a big-ass
vampire party up there, man.

1446
01:08:23,271 --> 01:08:25,072
Dracula kind of blushin'.

1447
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:28,410
They said when it's over,
they gonna kill everybody.

1448
01:08:28,443 --> 01:08:30,077
- Oh, God.
- Shit.

1449
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:31,912
Things all fucked up
around here, man.

1450
01:08:31,945 --> 01:08:34,416
Not me. They ain't
gonna get me.

1451
01:08:34,449 --> 01:08:36,318
They ain't gonna get me!

1452
01:08:37,452 --> 01:08:38,919
Come back here!

1453
01:08:38,952 --> 01:08:42,557
Fuck that!
I'm a real snitch!

1454
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:45,360
Those vampires
done bit me.

1455
01:08:46,594 --> 01:08:47,629
Did you hear that?

1456
01:08:47,662 --> 01:08:49,331
Yeah, you saw
how he took off?

1457
01:08:49,364 --> 01:08:51,932
This is exactly what
the monster wants.

1458
01:08:51,965 --> 01:08:53,301
He wants you
to attack him at night,

1459
01:08:53,335 --> 01:08:56,338
when he's strongest.
Don't fall for it.

1460
01:08:56,371 --> 01:08:58,606
What am I supposed to do?
I got a wife and a daughter over there.

1461
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,941
Just wait till the daytime,
when he's weak.

1462
01:09:00,974 --> 01:09:02,444
- And then we kill him.
- No, no, no, no.

1463
01:09:02,477 --> 01:09:03,877
If you wait
till the morning,

1464
01:09:03,911 --> 01:09:05,946
Lorena and Allie
will be vampires.

1465
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:08,416
- Oh.
- Junior, I love you to death.

1466
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:10,418
They already got
your sister in there.

1467
01:09:10,452 --> 01:09:13,254
They're trying to get your mama.
This is a good neighborhood

1468
01:09:13,288 --> 01:09:15,557
and I'm here to protect it,
because I'm Carl Black.

1469
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:18,460
And I'm Cronut.
We ride together, we die together!

1470
01:09:18,493 --> 01:09:20,295
Go lock up the house.

1471
01:09:20,328 --> 01:09:23,598
We need the right weapons
to kill this vampire.

1472
01:09:23,631 --> 01:09:25,567
- I made a phone call.
- Who you call?

1473
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,602
- Mr. Saturday Night.
- What?

1474
01:09:27,635 --> 01:09:29,637
He knows everything
about killing vampires.

1475
01:09:29,671 --> 01:09:31,171
Saturday Night?

1476
01:09:31,206 --> 01:09:34,041
I met him last Friday
at Fat Tuesday's.

1477
01:09:34,074 --> 01:09:36,043
Let's go. It's war.

1478
01:09:44,118 --> 01:09:46,221
Friends, let me do
all the talking.

1479
01:09:48,021 --> 01:09:50,458
I've seen this guy
kill lots of people.

1480
01:09:50,492 --> 01:09:52,394
Don't do
no bitch shit now.

1481
01:10:00,668 --> 01:10:01,603
Let's go.

1482
01:10:06,674 --> 01:10:09,411
He's the only one
to kill vampires.

1483
01:10:09,444 --> 01:10:11,479
He'll give us
all the weapons.

1484
01:10:13,046 --> 01:10:14,282
Just stay calm.

1485
01:10:16,116 --> 01:10:18,018
I believe in God,
first and foremost.

1486
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:19,454
So we huntin' vampires.

1487
01:10:19,487 --> 01:10:21,656
- I'm scared.
- What you scared of?

1488
01:10:21,689 --> 01:10:23,023
He looks like
The Undertaker.

1489
01:10:23,056 --> 01:10:25,025
I may not have what you want,

1490
01:10:25,058 --> 01:10:26,461
but I got just what you need.

1491
01:10:26,494 --> 01:10:27,662
Holy shit.

1492
01:10:29,196 --> 01:10:31,299
- You ain't playin'.
- No, he's not.

1493
01:10:31,332 --> 01:10:33,435
- Damn!
- You're gonna like this.

1494
01:10:35,002 --> 01:10:36,504
Whoa.

1495
01:10:36,538 --> 01:10:38,406
- Oh, that's cool. I like that.
- That's alkaline water.

1496
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:39,707
Alkaline? It's holy water!

1497
01:10:39,741 --> 01:10:41,643
Joel Osteen holy water.

1498
01:10:41,676 --> 01:10:43,378
It kind got
a pineapple taste to it.

1499
01:10:43,411 --> 01:10:48,683
Since we have vampires,
I got us some UV sunlight.

1500
01:10:48,716 --> 01:10:51,553
Hey, hey, hey.

1501
01:10:53,822 --> 01:10:56,056
You're Black, motherfucker.
It don't work as well.

1502
01:10:56,089 --> 01:10:57,592
Nigga, I can't see now.

1503
01:10:57,625 --> 01:11:00,595
They say short motherfuckers
love to get freaky,

1504
01:11:00,628 --> 01:11:03,731
so I brought this
just for you.

1505
01:11:03,765 --> 01:11:06,166
My boy. You know me,
don't you?

1506
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,068
- Not really.
- Is this real leather?

1507
01:11:08,101 --> 01:11:09,737
- Not really.
- I'm wearing this.

1508
01:11:09,771 --> 01:11:11,706
Look at that. Look,
look, look, look.

1509
01:11:11,739 --> 01:11:14,442
When y'all really ready to
take out some motherfuckers...

1510
01:11:14,476 --> 01:11:15,643
Ooh.

1511
01:11:15,677 --> 01:11:17,712
- This what I pull out.
- Shit.

1512
01:11:17,745 --> 01:11:20,615
- God is great.
- All the time.

1513
01:11:21,683 --> 01:11:23,150
If it ain't a Jesus.

1514
01:11:23,183 --> 01:11:25,253
You got a calling, Carl.
You put that on.

1515
01:11:25,286 --> 01:11:27,322
- Me?
- You put that on.

1516
01:11:29,624 --> 01:11:31,259
God gon' protect you.

1517
01:11:33,193 --> 01:11:34,629
There's something
I want to show you.

1518
01:11:36,631 --> 01:11:38,733
That look like
Leslie Jones' dildo.

1519
01:11:38,766 --> 01:11:40,668
Oh.

1520
01:11:40,702 --> 01:11:42,670
- Nigga...
- Hey, wait, wait, man.

1521
01:11:42,704 --> 01:11:44,037
- I think... I think he just stabbed me, he just...
- Stop it.

1522
01:11:44,071 --> 01:11:45,172
I felt it in my...
in my body.

1523
01:11:45,206 --> 01:11:46,774
No, you're cool.
Don't be bitches.

1524
01:11:46,808 --> 01:11:48,776
You look like you know
what's goin' on.

1525
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:51,078
I know exactly
what's goin' on.

1526
01:11:59,654 --> 01:12:01,589
Nigga, you're illuminati.
I see you.

1527
01:12:01,623 --> 01:12:03,090
Enough of that.

1528
01:12:03,992 --> 01:12:07,127
- Thank you, Mr. Friday the 13th.
- It's Saturday.

1529
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,563
Nigga,
this nigga Friday the 13th.

1530
01:12:08,596 --> 01:12:11,098
This nigga's... nigga!
All right, cool, cool.

1531
01:12:11,131 --> 01:12:12,367
You keep doing your thing.

1532
01:12:15,436 --> 01:12:17,305
That nigga's
on some <i>Harry Potter</i> shit.

1533
01:12:17,338 --> 01:12:19,407
It's cool, really. I know the nigga.

1534
01:13:01,549 --> 01:13:04,184
This motherfucker lit!

1535
01:13:04,218 --> 01:13:06,654
They know
how to party here.

1536
01:13:06,688 --> 01:13:09,324
We gotta find Allie.

1537
01:13:09,357 --> 01:13:10,725
Damn, man,
I'm staying right here.

1538
01:13:10,758 --> 01:13:12,594
I think I feel good
right here.

1539
01:13:21,235 --> 01:13:23,671
Cronut!
Go that way.

1540
01:13:35,249 --> 01:13:38,519
<i>...with three people dragging someone.</i>

1541
01:13:38,553 --> 01:13:40,622
- Neighborhood, somebody.
- <i>Harrison.</i>

1542
01:13:40,655 --> 01:13:42,857
- This is Harrison.
- <i>Do you guys need a backup unit?</i>

1543
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:44,692
No, I'm good,
Captain. I mean,

1544
01:13:44,726 --> 01:13:46,494
this shit making me a little
nervous for real, man.

1545
01:13:46,527 --> 01:13:48,496
I mean, we back down
to this spooky-ass house.

1546
01:13:48,529 --> 01:13:50,465
We just left here a
couple of days ago.

1547
01:13:50,498 --> 01:13:52,199
Listen, I don't want
to be no cop.

1548
01:13:52,233 --> 01:13:54,268
I just thought pieces of shit
dropped-dropped big time.

1549
01:13:54,302 --> 01:13:55,870
Man. My man is
shitting on himself.

1550
01:13:55,903 --> 01:13:57,705
This shit is spooky
out here, Captain.

1551
01:13:57,739 --> 01:14:00,408
I mean, shit,
there's all kinds of noises out here

1552
01:14:00,441 --> 01:14:02,810
and fucking some...
some wind and shit. Can y'all...

1553
01:14:02,844 --> 01:14:04,312
I don't got the heart
for this.

1554
01:14:04,345 --> 01:14:05,480
<i>Harrison,
is everything okay?</i>

1555
01:14:05,513 --> 01:14:07,281
What's wrong?
You're supposed to be...

1556
01:14:07,315 --> 01:14:09,182
You're supposed to be hard.
You're acting scared.

1557
01:14:09,217 --> 01:14:11,285
- What's wrong? Harry, what's wrong?
- <i>Harrison.</i>

1558
01:14:11,319 --> 01:14:13,287
I thought you had all the tricks
and now you're acting like a bitch.

1559
01:14:13,321 --> 01:14:14,756
<i>Harrison.</i>

1560
01:14:18,526 --> 01:14:20,595
A bite of crime
'bout to bite you, nigga.

1561
01:14:36,811 --> 01:14:40,381
I'm not a vampire.
My name's Allie, Allie Black.

1562
01:14:40,415 --> 01:14:41,916
I live next door.

1563
01:14:41,949 --> 01:14:45,987
If you could just get me
out of this, it would...

1564
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:47,789
Okay. Look, my... my...

1565
01:14:47,822 --> 01:14:51,993
Can you ask Dr.Mama-tunday-wanday
to come here?

1566
01:14:52,026 --> 01:14:55,530
Damn.

1567
01:15:03,671 --> 01:15:06,274
What the fuck was that?

1568
01:15:08,409 --> 01:15:10,578
Shut up.

1569
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:15,283
Don't talk.

1570
01:15:15,316 --> 01:15:16,851
What the fuck is
your problem? Shut up.

1571
01:15:20,722 --> 01:15:24,826
Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Hey.

1572
01:15:54,655 --> 01:15:57,391
- What?
- That was a silver metal nigga.

1573
01:15:57,425 --> 01:15:59,761
Oh, God.
A silver metal nigga?

1574
01:15:59,794 --> 01:16:01,629
Silver metal.
Not a regular nigga.

1575
01:16:01,662 --> 01:16:02,997
Metal nigga?

1576
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:05,399
There are more of them niggas around.
Trust me.

1577
01:16:08,503 --> 01:16:09,971
- Oh, shit.
- Whoo-whoo.

1578
01:16:11,105 --> 01:16:12,540
Oh, God.

1579
01:16:14,075 --> 01:16:15,710
Please don't hurt me.

1580
01:16:17,578 --> 01:16:19,847
Please, Mr. knight
in big, black armor.

1581
01:16:19,881 --> 01:16:21,516
- Oooh.
- Oh, my God.

1582
01:16:21,549 --> 01:16:23,918
Oh, my God.

1583
01:16:23,951 --> 01:16:27,989
- Shh.
- Mmm.

1584
01:16:28,022 --> 01:16:29,590
- It's Cronut, baby!
- What?!

1585
01:16:29,624 --> 01:16:31,826
- I got you, didn't I?
- Cronut... Cronut...

1586
01:16:31,859 --> 01:16:33,427
- You didn't even know it was me, did you?
- Cronut! Get me out of here.

1587
01:16:33,461 --> 01:16:34,962
- You gotta untie me out, please.
- Yeah.

1588
01:16:34,996 --> 01:16:36,964
You're as fine
as a motherfucker.

1589
01:16:36,998 --> 01:16:38,800
- When did you grow up?
- Cronut, shut... Shut the fuck up!

1590
01:16:38,833 --> 01:16:40,735
If you like it, we second cousins,
we ain't no kin, so we can...

1591
01:16:40,768 --> 01:16:43,371
Are you serious right now?
Shut the fuck up. I'm gonna tell Daddy.

1592
01:16:43,404 --> 01:16:45,573
Oh, shit, man.

1593
01:16:45,606 --> 01:16:48,042
Now I know why
the vampire wanted her.

1594
01:16:48,075 --> 01:16:51,913
Oh, hell no!
That's my baby.

1595
01:16:53,147 --> 01:16:57,852
Baby, please wake up.
Wake up, baby. Oh...

1596
01:16:57,885 --> 01:16:59,887
God.

1597
01:16:59,921 --> 01:17:01,088
- Get your damn hands off! Don't touch my lady!
- Jesus, fuck.

1598
01:17:01,122 --> 01:17:02,690
He's in there,
trying to kill us.

1599
01:17:02,723 --> 01:17:04,425
What the fuck is you
in this shit for

1600
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:05,993
- in the first place?
- I was trying to escape.

1601
01:17:06,027 --> 01:17:07,595
I was going with Freezee.

1602
01:17:07,628 --> 01:17:08,830
That's what getting
hot in the ass get you.

1603
01:17:08,863 --> 01:17:09,964
Hurry up and get me

1604
01:17:13,668 --> 01:17:14,769
All right. Let's go.

1605
01:17:14,802 --> 01:17:16,537
- What? Oh, oh!
- My feet.

1606
01:17:16,571 --> 01:17:18,072
I was going with Freezee and
I don't even know where he is.

1607
01:17:18,105 --> 01:17:19,674
Yeah, there it is,

1608
01:17:19,707 --> 01:17:20,908
- Stop looking at me.
- Shut the fuck... shh.

1609
01:17:20,942 --> 01:17:24,946
Please come back
to life.

1610
01:17:24,979 --> 01:17:28,149
Please, baby, I want
some of that pussy again.

1611
01:17:28,182 --> 01:17:30,818
I mean, I love you again.
I swear I love you.

1612
01:17:34,455 --> 01:17:35,723
Carl? Carl?

1613
01:17:36,924 --> 01:17:38,659
Jesus Christ,
what happened?

1614
01:17:38,693 --> 01:17:40,428
I had the worst dream.

1615
01:17:40,461 --> 01:17:41,729
What did he do to you?

1616
01:17:41,762 --> 01:17:46,467
I was, uh,
I was trying to bite you.

1617
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,069
Carl, what's in my mouth?

1618
01:17:48,102 --> 01:17:49,437
You look like Blac Chyna.

1619
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:51,005
Oh, stop.
What's in my mouth?

1620
01:17:51,038 --> 01:17:53,107
I don't know,
but I don't want no head no more.

1621
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:54,609
What is this, Carl?
What is this?

1622
01:17:54,642 --> 01:17:56,711
It look like a pimple
on the mouth.

1623
01:18:00,514 --> 01:18:01,916
Where is Daddy at?
Where is everybody?

1624
01:18:01,949 --> 01:18:03,551
They right here looking
for your stupid ass.

1625
01:18:03,584 --> 01:18:04,719
But how we gonna get them?

1626
01:18:04,752 --> 01:18:05,853
All right. This is
what we're gonna do.

1627
01:18:05,887 --> 01:18:07,788
All right.
This me, this you.

1628
01:18:07,822 --> 01:18:09,423
- When I'm gonna say "hike," you're gonna throw the ball...
- Right.

1629
01:18:09,457 --> 01:18:10,892
Nah, I don't like that play.

1630
01:18:10,925 --> 01:18:13,094
This is what we gon'
do, ten yards cut...

1631
01:18:13,127 --> 01:18:14,996
- Are you playing football?
- You-you want to get out of here or not?

1632
01:18:15,029 --> 01:18:16,964
- It doesn't work! Shut the fuck up.
- Just let's go.

1633
01:18:28,542 --> 01:18:30,978
- No.
- Calm down. No.

1634
01:18:31,012 --> 01:18:32,480
Don't you do
your neck like that.

1635
01:18:32,513 --> 01:18:34,048
Calm down.

1636
01:18:36,651 --> 01:18:38,486
- Calm the fuck down.
- Please, please.

1637
01:18:40,688 --> 01:18:44,492
No! Cronut, no!

1638
01:18:44,525 --> 01:18:46,027
Please.

1639
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,536
Don't you do it,
don't you do it.

1640
01:18:55,569 --> 01:18:58,039
No...

1641
01:19:01,075 --> 01:19:02,677
Mayweather.

1642
01:19:02,710 --> 01:19:03,811
He gave it like that.

1643
01:19:05,813 --> 01:19:07,682
Yeah!

1644
01:19:19,961 --> 01:19:23,231
I'm a vampire slayer.
I'm like Blade.

1645
01:19:23,265 --> 01:19:24,732
- I did that.
- You did what?

1646
01:19:24,765 --> 01:19:26,734
- I killed him.
- No, I did that. I did...

1647
01:19:26,767 --> 01:19:28,069
- Really?
- I'm Blade. Yeah, yeah.

1648
01:19:30,838 --> 01:19:32,640
Let's go find your dad.

1649
01:19:32,673 --> 01:19:35,142
Carl, I don't feel well.
Tell me, where are we?

1650
01:19:35,176 --> 01:19:36,510
<i>Lorena?</i>

Release my beloved.

That's the nigga

1655
01:19:44,919 --> 01:19:46,887
You don't mess
with a man's wife!

1656
01:19:46,921 --> 01:19:48,556
That is our wife.

1657
01:19:48,589 --> 01:19:50,758
She is at least
on a time share.

1658
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:52,960
I've been waiting
my whole life for you

1662
01:20:03,271 --> 01:20:05,906
Listen here,
Black Baltimore Raven.

1663
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:10,711
You will no longer
disparage my household.

1664
01:20:10,745 --> 01:20:11,946
Hit him

1665
01:20:16,017 --> 01:20:18,953
Hit him again. Damn,

1666
01:20:18,986 --> 01:20:21,188
Man, that's mango juice

1667
01:20:21,223 --> 01:20:22,823
Why this nigga

1668
01:20:22,857 --> 01:20:24,925
- Why?
- Oh, man. That's bullshit.

1669
01:20:24,959 --> 01:20:26,660
- What kind of nigga is this?
- Fuck you're gonna kill a vampire

1670
01:20:26,694 --> 01:20:28,963
with Visine, motherfucker?

1671
01:20:28,996 --> 01:20:30,097
Hit him
with that third one.

1672
01:20:30,131 --> 01:20:31,565
Punk bitch, die!

1673
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:35,569
This nigga is not dying.
Back up.

1674
01:20:35,603 --> 01:20:37,272
Thank you, ladies.

1675
01:20:37,305 --> 01:20:39,040
- Whoa.
- Daddy.

1676
01:20:39,073 --> 01:20:40,775
- Where you been?
- We've been looking for you.

1677
01:20:40,808 --> 01:20:43,278
- I saved Allie.
- No, I saved you.

1678
01:20:43,311 --> 01:20:45,213
<i>Enough!</i>

1679
01:20:47,181 --> 01:20:49,850
Look how you got my
woman's mouth looking, man.

1680
01:20:49,884 --> 01:20:53,187
I bring to you
from Africa, Egypt,

1681
01:20:53,221 --> 01:20:55,623
Denmark and Dayton.

1682
01:21:03,097 --> 01:21:04,598
That's Jodeci!

1683
01:21:08,236 --> 01:21:10,004
No!

1684
01:21:11,072 --> 01:21:14,708
I swear by the black hairs
of your chinny chin chin,

1685
01:21:14,742 --> 01:21:17,078
I will huff and puff

1686
01:21:17,111 --> 01:21:20,881
<i>and these
demons will blow your house down.</i>

1687
01:21:20,915 --> 01:21:22,817
What's up, y'all?

1688
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:25,387
- Watch out... oh!
- Oh, shit!

1689
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:26,887
What the hell are you
doing here?

1690
01:21:26,921 --> 01:21:28,323
Freezee,

1691
01:21:28,356 --> 01:21:29,824
what happened to you?

1692
01:21:29,857 --> 01:21:32,693
Vampire gang.
We out here, gang-gang!

1693
01:21:32,726 --> 01:21:34,262
They done hooked your boy up.

1694
01:21:34,296 --> 01:21:38,799
Half vampire, half goat
legs, full horse dick.

1695
01:21:38,833 --> 01:21:40,801
Donkey dick.

1696
01:21:42,237 --> 01:21:44,038
It's all backwards,
though.

1697
01:21:44,071 --> 01:21:45,873
Your ass
is forward, Freezee.

1698
01:21:45,906 --> 01:21:47,242
They done fuck me up
in the lab.

1699
01:21:47,275 --> 01:21:49,910
You're a hairy
retarded vampire.

1700
01:21:49,944 --> 01:21:51,712
- This ain't the life I chose.
- You fucked him up.

1701
01:21:51,745 --> 01:21:53,781
You fucked him up.
You fucked him up.

1702
01:21:53,814 --> 01:21:55,749
I appreciate it.
At least I can walk now.

1703
01:21:55,783 --> 01:21:58,353
Listen here,
Switchblade.

1704
01:21:58,386 --> 01:22:01,356
You already know
Black Lives Matter.

1705
01:22:01,389 --> 01:22:05,393
This is Black matter lives.

1706
01:22:06,861 --> 01:22:08,829
Welcome to the dark,
motherfucker.

1707
01:22:08,863 --> 01:22:10,731
<i>Attack!</i>

1708
01:22:10,764 --> 01:22:11,799
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

1709
01:22:43,831 --> 01:22:45,733
- You hit me in the nuts!
- I'm sorry.

1710
01:22:46,901 --> 01:22:48,403
I'm tired of your ass.

1711
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:55,176
Let's go, bitch.
Let's go.

1712
01:23:02,049 --> 01:23:03,751
I got you!

1713
01:23:11,293 --> 01:23:15,029
- Yeah, bitch!
- Die slow! Die slow!

1714
01:23:15,062 --> 01:23:16,764
Carl!
Behind you!

1715
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:29,211
Help her.

1716
01:23:34,282 --> 01:23:37,452
- I can't move my hand.
- I can't move mine.

1717
01:23:37,485 --> 01:23:39,787
I'm throwing up
gang signs.

1718
01:23:48,195 --> 01:23:50,265
Finally, Lorena.

1719
01:24:21,529 --> 01:24:24,932
Nigga is not dead yet.
I don't think he's dead.

1720
01:24:34,842 --> 01:24:36,211
Baby, he's not dead.

1721
01:24:39,347 --> 01:24:43,851
<i>You know I'm coming now.</i>

1722
01:24:46,086 --> 01:24:48,423
Go get the voodoo doll.
It's the only way to kill him.

1723
01:24:48,456 --> 01:24:50,791
- All right. Cool.
- Hurry.

1724
01:24:55,929 --> 01:24:57,465
Go lock the back door.

1725
01:24:57,499 --> 01:24:58,899
Get the doors locked.
Come on.

1726
01:24:58,932 --> 01:25:00,100
We can't kill him
without the voodoo doll!

1727
01:25:02,437 --> 01:25:04,439
Cronut, hurry up.
Hurry.

1728
01:25:06,006 --> 01:25:07,475
Hurry up, Cronut.

1729
01:25:09,344 --> 01:25:11,546
Wooky said this
will kill the vampire.

1730
01:25:11,579 --> 01:25:13,080
Is that it?

1731
01:25:13,113 --> 01:25:14,449
- Yeah.
- All right. Let's go.

1732
01:25:16,484 --> 01:25:17,885
Whoa! Shit!

1733
01:25:19,421 --> 01:25:21,256
Ah, shit!

1734
01:25:23,491 --> 01:25:26,193
Come on, come on. Oh, shit!

1735
01:25:26,227 --> 01:25:28,162
- Please. Please.
- Hey, hey, stop.

1736
01:25:28,195 --> 01:25:30,598
Please.

1737
01:25:32,367 --> 01:25:34,602
Shit!

1738
01:25:54,456 --> 01:25:55,989
<i>Lorena.</i>

1739
01:25:57,459 --> 01:26:00,127
<i>Come to me, Lorena.</i>

1740
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,230
- Carl...
- What's wrong?

1741
01:26:02,263 --> 01:26:03,964
He's calling me.

1742
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:09,136
<i>You can kill me,</i>

1743
01:26:09,169 --> 01:26:12,240
<i>but you cannot make me die.</i>

1744
01:26:22,217 --> 01:26:25,185
<i>I will have what belongs to me.</i>

1745
01:26:34,696 --> 01:26:36,930
I'm 'bout to go kill
Mamuwalde.

1746
01:26:36,964 --> 01:26:38,500
Okay.

1747
01:26:43,003 --> 01:26:44,506
Damn, Hugo.

1748
01:26:44,539 --> 01:26:46,073
Nobody calls me Hugo.

1749
01:26:47,208 --> 01:26:48,543
What do they call you then?

1750
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:50,978
<i>Filero.</i>

1751
01:26:51,011 --> 01:26:53,281
And what's <i>Filero?</i>

1752
01:26:53,314 --> 01:26:56,418
It means blade
in Mexican.

1753
01:26:59,521 --> 01:27:01,088
Really?

1754
01:27:15,035 --> 01:27:16,571
Carl... no...

1755
01:27:18,406 --> 01:27:20,742
<i>Where
do you think you're going?</i>

1756
01:27:20,775 --> 01:27:22,544
What did you just do
to me?

1757
01:27:22,577 --> 01:27:24,245
<i>Do you feel that?</i>

1758
01:27:25,613 --> 01:27:27,080
I got the voodoo doll.

1759
01:27:27,114 --> 01:27:29,651
Break the voodoo doll.

1760
01:27:29,684 --> 01:27:32,052
- What?
- Break the voodoo doll!

1761
01:27:33,187 --> 01:27:34,255
Cronut!

1762
01:27:34,289 --> 01:27:36,458
<i>Release your meaningless life.</i>

1763
01:27:36,491 --> 01:27:38,626
Fuck out that...

1764
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:41,028
<i>I see we don't know what immortal means.

1765
01:27:41,061 --> 01:27:43,531
Break the doll, the voodoo doll.

1766
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:46,701
- Break it!
- Break it!

1767
01:28:01,282 --> 01:28:04,252
- You motherfucker.
- <i>Don't you touch me.</i>

1768
01:28:08,623 --> 01:28:10,692
<i>Come to me, Lorena.</i>

1769
01:28:11,459 --> 01:28:14,596
- You better stop!
- <i>Come this way.</i>

1770
01:28:14,629 --> 01:28:17,030
Lorena, wake up!

1771
01:28:17,064 --> 01:28:18,533
<i>Lorena.</i>

1772
01:28:20,133 --> 01:28:22,604
<i>Take your place with me.</i>

1773
01:28:22,637 --> 01:28:24,439
Babe, don't do
this! Baby!

1774
01:28:24,472 --> 01:28:29,142
<i>We are the Jay-Z and Beyoncé
of the underworld.</i>

1775
01:28:30,845 --> 01:28:34,616
<i>Complete my darkness.</i>

1776
01:28:34,649 --> 01:28:37,819
<i>Come with me.
There's not much time left.</i>

1777
01:28:50,130 --> 01:28:52,433
<i>You don't need him.</i>

1778
01:28:52,467 --> 01:28:56,203
<i>He doesn't have a job
and he can't write a book.</i>

1779
01:29:06,881 --> 01:29:09,584
<i>I got this new book</i>
<i>coming out.</i> Terror Night.

1780
01:29:09,617 --> 01:29:11,286
Nigga! Ain't nobody
reading your book!

1781
01:29:11,319 --> 01:29:14,087
My book is in... in... in
Barnes and Noble's.

1782
01:29:14,121 --> 01:29:16,591
<i>That book was terrible.
It's one of the worst books I ever read.</i>

1783
01:29:16,624 --> 01:29:18,191
Carl, I'm not happy here.

1784
01:29:18,226 --> 01:29:19,594
I need the money, Dad.

1785
01:29:19,627 --> 01:29:21,462
Just... just leave.
Just leave. Go take a nap.

1786
01:29:21,496 --> 01:29:23,096
This ain't the time
for your goddamn book.

1787
01:29:24,232 --> 01:29:25,833
I don't know
if this is it for us.

1788
01:29:25,867 --> 01:29:28,736
I used to think it was the house,
the neighborhood, your book.

1789
01:29:31,573 --> 01:29:33,274
<i>You need to realize
that family's</i>

1790
01:29:33,308 --> 01:29:34,742
<i>the most important thing
in life, not a book.</i>

1791
01:29:36,277 --> 01:29:37,312
- I'm moving out.
- You're messing up.

1792
01:29:39,347 --> 01:29:42,182
It's you and I that don't work.
It's you.

1793
01:29:45,353 --> 01:29:47,622
<i>Come to me now.</i>

1794
01:29:52,393 --> 01:29:54,161
Carl Black,
save your wife.

1795
01:30:09,377 --> 01:30:13,414
Global warming is real.

1796
01:30:30,932 --> 01:30:34,502
Jack Mihoff,
ANN News Live with the Buzz.

1797
01:30:34,535 --> 01:30:36,804
So you've survived the Purge.

1798
01:30:36,838 --> 01:30:40,341
You and this ragtag
band of pimps, hoes...

1799
01:30:40,375 --> 01:30:41,709
- No, that's my family.
- Sorry, what?!

1800
01:30:41,743 --> 01:30:43,378
No. It wasn't no pimps
and hoes over here.

1801
01:30:43,411 --> 01:30:45,178
You defeated the vampire.

1802
01:30:45,213 --> 01:30:47,348
Saved the whole
entire neighborhood.

1803
01:30:47,382 --> 01:30:50,585
Have you, Black Panther,
Chloe, and Bow-Wow

1804
01:30:50,618 --> 01:30:54,187
ever thought about becoming
the new Black Ghostbusters?

1805
01:30:57,358 --> 01:30:59,961
- Hunting ghosts?
- Hunting ghosts? I mean...

1806
01:30:59,994 --> 01:31:01,462
You don't have
to answer that, Carl.

1807
01:31:01,496 --> 01:31:03,364
It's a good idea.
We could make money.

1808
01:31:03,398 --> 01:31:04,666
Let's wait,
let's wait.

1809
01:31:04,699 --> 01:31:06,901
Don't be a bitch.
Let's make this money, Carl.

1810
01:31:06,934 --> 01:31:09,537
Yes. Don't be a bitch.
Make the money.

1811
01:31:09,570 --> 01:31:11,339
And what the fuck
did you do?

1812
01:31:11,372 --> 01:31:12,907
- Look at me.
- We could make money, Carl.

1813
01:31:12,940 --> 01:31:15,209
- Get the money, Carl.
- Carl, let's do it.

1814
01:31:15,243 --> 01:31:17,245
- I'm gonna make money.
- Yeah. Why-why not?

1815
01:31:17,278 --> 01:31:18,846
One more question.
Handicapped white man,

1816
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:21,916
is it true that your first
experience with vampires

1817
01:31:21,949 --> 01:31:25,520
was in the jungle in Hanoi
where your troop was ambushed,

1818
01:31:25,553 --> 01:31:29,957
you were ravaged,
and your legs were completely destroyed?

1819
01:31:29,991 --> 01:31:32,360
Fuck you, Sammy Sosa.

1820
01:31:32,393 --> 01:31:33,895
One thing I hate
about this neighborhood...

1821
01:31:33,928 --> 01:31:35,763
all the goddamn vampires.

1822
01:31:35,797 --> 01:31:38,766
Well, we would just
like to thank you

1823
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,968
for your service
to this country and make...

1824
01:31:41,002 --> 01:31:42,570
Oh, my Lord!
