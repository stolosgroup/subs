00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,958
You sure you don't wanna use
the variable scope for this?

3
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,875
No. I've got a lock
on vector and trajectory.

4
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,791
You ever hear that saying,
"Listen to your elders"?

5
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:48,541
Big phrase, especially here in Japan.

6
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,041
So you're an elder now?

7
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:54,875
"Elder" doesn't necessarily mean old.
It just means older.

8
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,500
As in smarter, wiser.

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,125
But hey, I'm serious.
We blow this chance, it's seven years...

10
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,625
Seven years of hard work down the drain.

11
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,916
Ah, so you do listen to me.

12
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,500
V,

13
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,791
I haven't missed once in 12 years.

14
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:14,583
Not gonna miss.

15
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,500
All right. Let's dance.

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,625
Oh, one last thing.

17
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:32,416
See? And you say
I only think about the work.

18
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,000
Hi, uh...

19
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,500
Shitennō-ji Temple, please, which way?

20
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:09,416
It's behind you, back the way you came.

21
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,125
No.

22
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,250
- Back that way?
- Yes.

23
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,125
Well,
never mind, then.

24
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,833
Here, catch!

25
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,463
<i>Seasonal, single male mark.</i>

26
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,625

<i>Target visible.
Seasonal, the window is open.</i>

<i>You're green.</i>

29
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,875
I've got a protocol breach.

00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,318
<i>I repeat, you are green.</i>

31
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,291

00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,000
<i>Overridden. Take the shot.</i>

33
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,250
Hold on. There... there's a kid here.

34
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,416
<i>The window is closing.
I repeat, take the shot, Seasonal.</i>

35
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,333
Please reconfirm.

36
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,083

39
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,083
Help!

40
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,125
<i> I've thought
about this a long time.</i>

41
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,041
<i>I wanna talk retirement.</i>

42
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,875
<i> What happened in Osaka

43
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,583
<i>It was wrong.</i>

44
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,250
Nobody knew she'd be there.

45
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,333
We had one rule, V.

46
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,916
One simple rule. No kids.

47
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I know.

48
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,625
I mean, this ain't your first rodeo.

49
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,458
You know there's collateral damage.
You know that.

50
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:58,708
I can't shake it.

51
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,708
Trust me, I've tried.

52
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,791
Almost to the head of the snake.

53
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,291
Look, I promised
I'd finish the job, and I will.

54
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,541
And then I'm out.

55
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,458
I want a life, V.

56
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,791
You know, I never had one.

57
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,166
A real, regular life.

58
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,458
What does that mean?

59
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,500
I mean, what... Family? Kids?

60
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:37,208
- Uh, picket fence? Dogs? Suburbs?
- I don't know.

61
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,541
Something like that.

62
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,458
Two trips to Walmart, you'll be back.

63
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,458
It must be killing you.

64
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,083
You haven't even touched your Merlot.

65
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,333
It's Margaux.

66
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,125
I'm sorry, that was a total pickup line.

67
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,750
Fuck it. I mean, listen.

68
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,416
The worst way
to start a conversation is a "hey."

69
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,791
It's boring. It's dull.
It's, uh, for horses.

70
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,916
So anything but that.

71
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,166
I'm Stephen.

72
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,333
Hey.

73
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:32,375
Shibuya-ku Sendagaya 4-7-11.
Shibuya-ku Sendagaya 4-7-11.

74
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,458
Time to leave.

75
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,541
Seasonal, on-site.

76
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,458
<i> Copy.
Stage mark. Northwest corner.</i>

77
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,958
Sector and trajectory?

78
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,541
<i>Main entrance,
two black sedans. Single.</i>

79
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,291
Contact.

80
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,500
Primary win...

81
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,875
<i>Seasonal, repeat.</i>

82
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,500
Window on primary?

83
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,750
<i>Ten seconds, max.</i>

84
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,000
<i>Seasonal, report.</i>

85
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Holding on yellow.

86
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,250
<i>Target visible. You are green.</i>

87
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:55,000
<i>Window is closed.
Seasonal, report.</i>

88
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,625
- New point.
<i>- Negative. You are red.</i>

89
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,208
- New point.
<i>- The window is closed.</i>

90
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,541
Find him immediately!

91
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,375
Hey.

92
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,333
He can't have gone far!

93
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,583
Stop, stop. Fuck's sake.

94
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,208
<i> Now you start the rest of your life</i>.

95
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,875
- What's your name?
- Kate.

96
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,666
Kate. I'm Varrick.

97
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,333
<i>I'm your handler now.</i>

98
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:17,333
That makes me your mother,
your father, your best friend,

99
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,125
<i>and your therapist.</i>

100
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,875
Left. That all you got? Left.

101
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,500
Good.

102
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,041
It's good. You're awake.

103
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,083
You've been out almost a day.

104
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,750
Have you had
any recent exposure

105
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,166
to radioactive materials?

106
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,166
No.

107
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:09,958
The reason I ask is you appear to be
suffering from, uh, accelerated ARS.

108
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,208
Acute radiation syndrome.

109
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,333
Lethal.

110
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,416
Caused by subjection
to potent radiation in

111
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,250
extremely short amount of time.

112
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,458
Which substance?

113
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,000
We looked for the usuals.

114
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,458
Iodine-131, thallium, but, uh,

115
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,708
it appears to be more specific.

116
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,041
Polonium-210?

117
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,291
204.

118
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,833
We'll take the Margaux to go.

119
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,416
Please do not try to...

120
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,500
How much time do I have?

121
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,166
A day, maybe.

122
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,416
But we will make it painless for you.

123
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,041
Shit.

124
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,041
It's possible that...

125
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,458
I'll get a nurse.

126
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:55,916
You can't come this way.
The decontamination room is that way.

127
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,517
- Where is the patient?
- I don't know!

128
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,661
- I will have the doctor come.
- And let security know too.

129
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,666
She's in bad shape.

130
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,125
- Sano-san, patient is missing.
- What?

131
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,333
What do you mean, she's missing?

132
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,625
- Search for her immediately!
- Yes, sir!

133
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,291
Excuse me.

134
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,916
Five liters of blood in the body,
heart pumps two a minute.

135
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,625
Gun's on your femoral. You do the math.

136
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,958
I need something to keep me going.

137
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,708
I want stimulants.

138
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,166
These. Load them in the shots, go.

139
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,000
Give me five.

140
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,666
- Come on.
- Okay.

141
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,500
I don't have all the time in the world.

142
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,666
What are you trying to do?

143
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,666
Shibuya-ku Sendagaya.
Shibuya-ku Sendagaya.

144
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:10,375
- ...take a shower.
- We should just have fun!

145
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,666
- It's the last night. Come on!
- I know.

146
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,000
But I still have stuff to do.

147
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,916
Oh, my God!

148
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,375
Who are you?

149
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,070
Why'd you poison me?

150
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,916
What are you talking about? Poison?

151
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,833
I didn't know it was...

152
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:32,208
They told me it was just a roofie
so they could lift the room.

153
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,458
Who? Who told you?

154
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,416
Even if I knew, I'd be dead if I tell you.

155
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,541
- Aw, she'll be dead if you don't.
- Wait.

156
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,500
Don't.

157
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,708
Sato.

158
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,958
Kazuo Sato. He manages a yakuza club.

159
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,125
Which clan?

160
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,583
Kijima.

161
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,250
Fuck, it's a Kijima clan.

162
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,625
They've owned us for years.

163
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,875
Masato said that
if he did this one last thing,

164
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,291
that he would set us free.

165
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,958
We could actually start over now.

166
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,333
A different life.

167
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Please.

168
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,916
These might fit you.

169
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,041
Can I get you something?

170
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,291
Anything?

171
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,208
Boom Boom Lemon?

172
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,125
You got any?

173
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,750
Oh, um...

174
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,291
No, sorry.

175
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,125
I'm Kanako.

176
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,958
And it seems we're the same.

177
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,333
Collateral damage.

178
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,666
I'm Kate.

179
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,625
And they're gonna know I was here.

180
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,708
Who?

181
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,416
Everyone.

182
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,500
Poisoned by who?

183
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,500
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

184
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,708
Well, there must be some antidote.

185
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,375
For polonium-204?

186
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,958
Who was the mark, V?

187
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,291
Kate, you know, uh...

188
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:36,916
V?

189
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,416
Who was the mark?

190
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,666
You won't get
any more questions from me after today.

191
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,333
A man named Kijima.

192
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,000
I recognized him from Osaka.

193
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,000
Who is he?

194
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:05,583
Grand honcho
of the biggest family in Tokyo.

195
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:10,375
Your mark in Osaka
was Kijima's younger brother, Kentaro.

196
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:19,333
I won't lie, it's been a shit show
for us, as it's been for you, and...

197
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:24,458
...Kijima, apparently,
who hasn't been able to let it go.

198
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,375
This was revenge for Osaka?

199
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:31,416
Some people have this extraordinary
attachment to their siblings,

200
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,125
as if genetics make a family and...

201
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:43,416
Anyway, all that honor shit,
Kijima's been on a tear against the...

202
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,375
How do I get to him?

203
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:49,750
Kijima doesn't surface.

204
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,041
Not after Osaka.

205
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:56,000
Last night was a very rare opportunity.

206
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,791
What about Sato? Kazuo Sato. Ring a bell?

207
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:05,750
I know that some of his guys hang out
at a place called the Black Lizard.

208
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:06,958
That's a start.

209
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,216
Welcome to the Black Lizard.

210
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:02,458
Good evening, boss.

211
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:51,958
Sir.

212
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:57,458
After what happened last night,
I'm getting worried.

213
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:02,458
Kijima has gone into hiding.

214
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:05,458
I see.

215
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:09,708
First Kentaro, now Kijima.

216
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:10,916
Our leadership is...

217
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:13,458
Who the fuck...

218
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:17,333
Go.

219
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,208
You Sato?

220
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:30,125
Kazuo Sato?

221
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:34,333
Who are you? What...

222
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:35,500
Did you poison me?

223
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,708
You don't tell me, I kill you.

224
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:43,083
I think you're lying, I kill you.

225
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,583
Did you poison me?

226
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:51,625
Yeah.

227
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,500
Why?

228
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:00,833
Hey!

229
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:02,208
Why'd you poison me?

230
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:04,625
I only follow orders.

231
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:07,875
From Kijima?

232
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:11,708
Kijima-san?
You talked with the boss?

233
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:13,583
Of course not!

234
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:16,333
Please.

235
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:18,541
Where is Kijima?

236
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:21,750
How do I get to him?

237
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:23,583
Nobody knows.

238
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:33,916
All right. Same question, same deal.

239
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,059
- You killed him! He is the...
- He is dead. You worry about you.

240
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,125
You crazy! I don't know!

241
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:42,791
Drop your weapons!

242
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:44,875
Or else he dies.

243
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:56,250
I'm gonna ask one more time.

244
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,666
Where is Kijima?

245
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:02,000
Last chance.

246
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:05,500
Please. I don't know...

247
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:44,666
Shit!

248
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:22,916
Ani. Ani-chan would know.

249
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,125
She is Kijima's niece.

250
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:33,916
Ani?

251
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:24,916
Ouch! What the fuck!?

252
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,625
Hey, hey, stop!

253
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:38,083
Hey! Stop!

254
00:31:44,791 --> 00:31:46,541
Come on. Ow!

255
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,500
- Get up.
<i>- Kuso!</i>

256
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,000
You slapped me!

257
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:54,625
Stop, or I'll... Fuck.

258
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:13,875
Okay. Okay, okay.

259
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:18,875
Next one goes in there.

260
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:20,958
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

261
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:26,583
You're gonna call Kijima for me.

262
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:29,000
What?

263
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:31,041
Kijima. Call him.

264
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:33,083
I can't. I don't have his number.

265
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:34,875
Oh, you don't have his number? Really?

266
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,708
Kijima, yeah, I don't have his number!

267
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:38,791
- How do you reach him?
- Okay, who are you?

268
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:40,833
How do you get in touch with him?

269
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:44,708
I don't know, I just call <i>ano baka </i>Renji.

270
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:46,041
Renji?

271
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:48,875
His top adviser, you stupid foreigner!

272
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:54,541
The only person that talks to him.

273
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,541
Okay. Call Renji.

274
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,750
<i> Hai, Shinzo.</i>

275
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:07,041
- Shinzo?
<i>- </i><i> Ani-chan?</i>

276
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:09,750
Why the fuck
are you answering Renji's phone?

277
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:11,375
Put Renji on. Hurry.

278
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:15,125
It's important! I'm kidnapped.

279
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:27,208
<i> Ani?</i>

280
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:31,833
Renji, some foreign whore
just kidnapped me.

281
00:33:31,916 --> 00:33:34,309
I got the kid.
If Kijima wants to see her again,

282
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:37,625
he can meet me at the center
of Murakawa marketplace in one hour.

283
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:40,250
- A second more, and she dies.
<i>- Who is this?</i>

284
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:48,458
You're crazy.

285
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:50,750
You wanna get Kijima?

286
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,166
Dipshit foreigner.

287
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,684
You think you can...
You can't get to him this way.

288
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:58,416
He doesn't give a shit about me.

289
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:01,708
No one does.

290
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,583
Come on.

291
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,761
<i>We cannot disturb
Oyabun with a problem like this.</i>

292
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:16,708
Now, we're going to take care of this
for him.

293
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:19,541
He must never know this happened!

294
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:21,166
Huh?

295
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:23,708
So do whatever you have to do...

296
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:24,958
Yes, sir!

297
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:30,458
Hey, Shinzo, sit down.

298
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:37,250
If something were to happen to Ani,

299
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:39,208
it would be utterly tragic.

300
00:34:40,916 --> 00:34:44,416
It would mean the end of his bloodline
and all that it entails.

301
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,416
Would be most regrettable.

302
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:49,333
Yes.

303
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:51,833
Do you really understand?

304
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:56,291
Yes,

305
00:34:56,916 --> 00:34:57,916
Renji-san.

306
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:18,588
And you know,
for your information,

307
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:21,791
I haven't talked
or seen my uncle in, like, a year.

308
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:30,250
Shit.

309
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:34,583
Ew, what the fuck?
Oh, my God, what is wrong with you?

310
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:35,666
Sit down.

311
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:39,250
I said, sit down!

312
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:41,708
Yeah, no way. You're all gross and sick.

313
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:42,833
And you know what?

314
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,291
Fuck you, cancer bitch.

315
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,750
Hey, I have to go to the bathroom.

316
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:11,708
Me too.

317
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:13,875
Come on.

318
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:18,583
Ouch.

319
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:20,833
Welcome.

320
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,750
Hey.

321
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,666
You got any Boom Boom Lemon?

322
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:42,166
No, I'm sorry.

323
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,500
Well, this sucks.

324
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:09,041
Ugh! I can barely breathe in here.

325
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:29,708
No way.

326
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,333
So many scars and... and blood.

327
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:36,958
It's so...

328
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:38,666
It's gross, I know.

329
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,416
Gr... No, no, no.

330
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:43,375
I think it's awesome.

331
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,541
Ow!

332
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:28,125
What the fuck are you doing, bitch?

333
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:36,750
This will keep you safe. Trust me.

334
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:12,583
- Welcome!
- Two chickens.

335
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:13,916
<i>Hai.</i>

336
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:23,583
- <i>Dozo.
- Arrigato.</i>

337
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,958
You take the north entrance.
You take the other side. You come with me.

338
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,875
Whoever finds the kid,
bring her to me. Go!

339
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:00,958
Thank you.

340
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:14,291
Where is Ani-chan?

341
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:19,375
I don't see Kijima.

342
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:24,708
Let me see the child first.

343
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,750
Either Kijima walks out right now,

344
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:30,500
or I leave,
and you never see the kid alive again.

345
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:36,125
Catch her!

346
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:28,541
Shoot her! Shoot!

347
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:18,916
Boo!

348
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:31,041
Fuck off.

349
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:34,083
Go.

350
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:40,750
Stupid shit!

351
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:43,291
Ani.

352
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,541
Shinzo.

353
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:57,267
She tied me up
in the fucking bathroom!

354
00:43:57,291 --> 00:44:00,041
The freak foreigner!
Bitch has cancer and...

355
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:18,333
What are you doing, Shinzo?

356
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:25,541
Shinzo... you... you bastard...

357
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:28,166
We're done with you...

358
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:32,250
Now you can join your father,

359
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:35,416
you little half-race bitch.

360
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:54,791
Oh my God.

361
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:07,916
- You better get out of here.
- Wait!

362
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:09,750
Hey.

363
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:13,958
Hey. Where are we going?

364
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:20,750
Stop following me. Stop.

365
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:23,208
What?
You're just gonna leave me, then?

366
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:25,916
Kijima didn't show.
You're useless to me now.

367
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:29,208
Did you see what just happened?

368
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:32,291
My own family wants me gone.
Where the fuck will I go?

369
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:34,458
Not my problem.

370
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,833
I'll be dead
before the night's over.

371
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:39,416
Hey, that makes two of us.

372
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,375
Why did you save me, then, huh?

373
00:45:41,458 --> 00:45:42,875
You're making me regret it!

374
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:46,666
You... you're a... No!
You can't abandon me.

375
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:50,458
I know Kijima killed my dad,
and he will kill me.

376
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:52,583
What did I do wrong, huh?

377
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:57,708
I haven't done anything to anybody,
but they still treat me like shit!

378
00:46:05,041 --> 00:46:07,916
Everybody, all the time,
just... just throwing me around,

379
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,208
like I'm some piece of...
some piece of garbage.

380
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:14,250
Shut up!
You don't know what you're talking about.

381
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:17,166
You just yap, yap, yap.
Just "fuck this, fuck that."

382
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,583
- You don't know anything!
- You're a kid!

383
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:37,041
Medicine. Dropped it.

384
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:44,083
What's wrong with you?

385
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,375
I'm dying.

386
00:47:03,291 --> 00:47:04,958
Kijima did this, right?

387
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,541
Are you gonna go kill him?

388
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:16,291
You're a badass killer motherfucker.

389
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:25,708
You'll need me, you know. Like...

390
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:27,750
Just... just look at you. You...

391
00:47:30,416 --> 00:47:32,791
You won't make it an hour
without my help, okay?

392
00:47:34,666 --> 00:47:38,333
And... and I can... I can do everything, okay?

393
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:40,208
I know who, where, when, whatever.

394
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:42,375
- I can help you get him, get my uncle.
- Okay.

395
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:46,333
And I'm really good
at... at shortcuts and... and maps and...

396
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:50,375
What?

397
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:52,083
I said okay.

398
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:54,333
Okay.

399
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:11,333
Um...

400
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:14,208
You can't walk around like this.

401
00:48:22,291 --> 00:48:24,500
Sold out.

402
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:27,625
Boom Boom Lemon?
Artificial shit.

403
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:30,875
You know what?
This is stupid. Let's go.

404
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,291
Yeah, clean clothes are stupid.

405
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:36,333
"Everything I should wear
should be just covered in blood."

406
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:40,333
Aw, it's so cute on you.

407
00:48:46,041 --> 00:48:47,125
Come on.

408
00:48:50,916 --> 00:48:52,375
You're so cool.

409
00:48:52,458 --> 00:48:55,416
But you're also a Terminator, bitch.

410
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,708
- Oh my God.
- "I die."

411
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:05,750
Seriously, we're...

412
00:49:06,458 --> 00:49:08,625
We're actually pretty much the same.

413
00:49:09,791 --> 00:49:10,875
It's scary.

414
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:16,083
Who has a line into Kijima?

415
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:18,125
Only Renji. I told you.

416
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:19,333
His main adviser.

417
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:24,041
That was my dad's job.

418
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:26,791
But he got shot.

419
00:49:27,583 --> 00:49:29,333
Kijima did it, I'm sure.

420
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,750
And Renji was there too.

421
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:36,208
How do I find Renji?

422
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:39,583
Um, probably with his <i>aijin.</i>

423
00:49:39,666 --> 00:49:40,708
His what?

424
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,000
His boyfriend, Jojima.

425
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:46,541
- Tell me where.
- Mmm.

426
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:50,166
It's this fucking cool penthouse,
top of the tower.

427
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:52,833
- The entire floor is theirs.
- Security?

428
00:49:54,666 --> 00:49:57,125
I mean, two in the lobby, at least.

429
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:01,000
- Service entrance?
- Yeah.

430
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,958
The back, by the kitchen.

431
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:07,375
We could just shoot our ways in.

432
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:10,166
And risk Renji escaping?

433
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:13,166
No, I can't alarm him. I have to get
to him before he knows what's wrong.

434
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:17,125
- We'll be fast, okay? Bang, bang! Brrap!
- "You're dead..."

435
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:20,750
Stop. Speak less, open your ears.

436
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:25,625
We're gonna distract them.

437
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:28,208
<i>You're</i> going to distract them.

438
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:31,666
How?

439
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:34,375
By being you. Just, you know, louder.

440
00:50:35,875 --> 00:50:37,791
Okay, cool. So...

441
00:50:38,625 --> 00:50:39,875
Can I have a gun?

442
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:41,000
No.

443
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:42,763
Thank you for waiting.

444
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,291
Help me!

445
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:01,375
Help me!

446
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:02,500
Help me!

447
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,708
I escaped. I just...

448
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:11,500
She had me tied up,
but I chewed through the ropes.

449
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:13,708
Escaped from where? Who are you?

450
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,541
Please, I don't want to be outside.

451
00:51:16,166 --> 00:51:17,791
I don't... I'm scared!

452
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:25,083
<i>Damn it! We are sitting ducks!</i>

453
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:26,791
<i>You have to go on without me.</i>

454
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:29,125
- <i> I refuse</i>.
<i>- Me too.</i>

455
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:51,333
There's a girl here.
She says she's the Oyabun's niece.

456
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:54,125
Ani-chan?

457
00:51:54,916 --> 00:51:56,916
Thank you. You can go now.

458
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:01,375
What do you want here?

459
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:04,000
I want you to meet someone.

460
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:11,583
Where's Renji?

461
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:16,208
- What do you want from Renji-san?
- It's not your concern.

462
00:52:19,291 --> 00:52:22,166
Of course it is my concern.

463
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:24,666
Your concern is to stay whole
until I leave here.

464
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:28,958
Renji?

465
00:52:31,708 --> 00:52:34,041
You may do to me what you must.

466
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,541
But I will not be disclosing
his whereabouts.

467
00:52:42,916 --> 00:52:43,916
Shut the blinds.

468
00:52:47,833 --> 00:52:52,041
Shit, there's one remote for everything.

469
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:10,791
Shit, shit.

470
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:49,416
Stop, Jojima!

471
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:51,166
Back off!

472
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:54,833
You motherfucker! Stop it!

473
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,625
<i>Konoyaro! </i>Stop it!

474
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:07,125
You motherfucker!

475
00:55:07,625 --> 00:55:08,625
Stop it!

476
00:55:13,208 --> 00:55:15,583
Fuck. I'm sorry. Fuck.

477
00:55:31,166 --> 00:55:34,500
This is what we do
to monsters intruding on our home.

478
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:46,625
There's blood on my...

479
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:48,041
There's blood...

480
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:50,583
There's blood on my face. There's blood.

481
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:03,750
Hey.

482
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:05,083
Hey, hey.

483
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:08,708
Come on. Come on. Come here.

484
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:10,708
No.

485
00:56:10,791 --> 00:56:13,416
- No, stop it. Stop it! Stop!
- Hey. Look at me.

486
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:21,083
Look only at me, okay?
Look only at me and breathe.

487
00:56:21,916 --> 00:56:24,041
Breathe.

488
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,500
Breathe.

489
00:56:28,375 --> 00:56:30,250
Okay? You're gonna live through this.

490
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:32,125
Okay?

491
00:56:32,208 --> 00:56:33,916
All right? You're doing great.

492
00:56:34,583 --> 00:56:35,583
Okay?

493
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:38,083
Come here.

494
00:56:39,083 --> 00:56:40,083
Come here.

495
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:54,083
Hey, maybe we should check
this house, huh?

496
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:55,333
Maybe there's some, uh...

497
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:57,750
- Clues?
- Clues. Yeah.

498
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:38,291
Bingo.

499
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:41,041
- Hey, I think I know where Renji is.
- Yeah?

500
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:45,416
Check this out.

501
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:47,416
Cellular tracking.

502
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:52,125
I can see exactly where Renji is
and where he will be.

503
00:57:54,166 --> 00:57:55,291
That's very good.

504
00:57:57,916 --> 00:57:59,000
"Useless."

505
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:16,208
Move!

506
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:18,750
What are you doing?

507
00:58:18,833 --> 00:58:20,166
Fucking kid!

508
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:26,125
Ani?

509
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:28,291
Drive! Drive!

510
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:29,375
Bang!

511
00:58:31,958 --> 00:58:32,958
Bang!

512
00:58:50,458 --> 00:58:51,875
Uh, hey, Renji.

513
00:58:53,625 --> 00:58:56,291
I gotta be honest,
I'm having a rough night.

514
00:58:56,375 --> 00:58:59,708
I really need to see your boss Kijima.

515
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:03,517
- Ani-chan! What are you...
- Speak English, motherfucker.

516
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:06,291
How dare you talk to your elder like that!

517
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:07,583
English, I said.

518
00:59:09,833 --> 00:59:11,458
We're family, Ani!

519
00:59:11,958 --> 00:59:14,333
You don't go against your family,
against your own people!

520
00:59:17,041 --> 00:59:18,833
<i>Wakatta. Wakatta.</i>

521
00:59:18,916 --> 00:59:20,541
What fucking family?

522
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:21,750
<i>Fuzakenna.</i>

523
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:24,166
Family killed my father.

524
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:25,666
Family tried to kill me.

525
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:30,083
All of you asshole hyenas
getting fat off of my dad's carcass!

526
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:32,958
Look, I understand.

527
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:43,375
Look.

528
00:59:44,291 --> 00:59:47,041
Just give him to me,
and you'll live. Okay?

529
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:49,375
I do not know.

530
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:54,458
When he disappears like this,
he says, "To be amongst family."

531
00:59:55,708 --> 00:59:57,166
I don't know what it means.

532
00:59:58,500 --> 00:59:59,500
I know where he is.

533
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,500
Your phone.

534
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:28,375
<i> I found him. I found Kijima.</i>

535
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:30,708
I'm gonna finish it, V.

536
01:00:32,291 --> 01:00:34,000
<i>Hey, I promised you, didn't I?</i>

537
01:00:34,083 --> 01:00:37,208
Kate, tell me where you are.
I'll come to you right now.

538
01:00:37,291 --> 01:00:38,166
Let me help you.

539
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:39,930
<i>Don't. I'll already be dead anyway.</i>

540
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:47,916
You can find my body
near a house in Hottazaka.

541
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:49,875
<i>In the hills.</i>

542
01:00:57,125 --> 01:00:58,250
Goodbye, V.

543
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:03,750
Kate?

544
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:24,166
- The hills, please.
- Not going that way. I'm so sorry!

545
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:27,125
Don't apologize. Just drive.

546
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,416
Does that hurt?

547
01:01:44,791 --> 01:01:46,000
When you do that.

548
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,666
No more questions.

549
01:01:56,708 --> 01:01:58,500
I don't know anything about you.

550
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,125
Don't need to.

551
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:06,625
Do you wanna know about me?

552
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:09,458
I know enough.

553
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,750
But I'm... I'm the last person
you'll get to know.

554
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:18,458
You don't wanna know me?

555
01:02:23,416 --> 01:02:24,958
That's sad, Kate.

556
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:27,500
I think that's... that's really...

557
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
It's sad.

558
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,666
My mom's a <i>gaijin</i> too.

559
01:02:46,958 --> 01:02:48,583
That's why I've never met her.

560
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:51,500
Never even seen a picture.

561
01:02:52,375 --> 01:02:53,500
They won't... I...

562
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:55,875
I don't know what she looks like.

563
01:03:03,666 --> 01:03:05,250
She was like you, I bet.

564
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:10,041
Tall and... and pretty.

565
01:03:11,916 --> 01:03:15,250
No shit from no dudes.
Just doing what she wants all the time.

566
01:03:17,166 --> 01:03:18,583
Total killer babe.

567
01:03:21,041 --> 01:03:22,125
Killer babe.

568
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:25,458
It's the old family house.
No one really knows about it.

569
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:27,583
Where they all grew up.

570
01:04:28,291 --> 01:04:29,375
The elders and shit.

571
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,166
My dad too.

572
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:48,833
Go on.

573
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:50,458
I'll finish this.

574
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,250
What? You'll finish it?

575
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,791
Hey, look at you.
You can't stand, and you can't see.

576
01:04:57,541 --> 01:04:58,708
Okay? You're gonna die.

577
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:00,541
Yeah, after I kill him.

578
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:07,666
- I'm here now. I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

579
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:09,333
Why not? I go where you go.

580
01:05:09,416 --> 01:05:10,958
Because you're a fucking kid.

581
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:13,708
Go be one.

582
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:16,208
I never could.

583
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:19,833
Hey, Ani...

584
01:05:22,791 --> 01:05:23,791
You're young.

585
01:05:25,625 --> 01:05:27,041
You have time to forget.

586
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:33,375
Be someone less angry.

587
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,666
Take control of your own life.

588
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:45,250
Go.

589
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:24,708
Yotsuya Kaidan,
do you know this story?

590
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:27,291
Look at me.

591
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:34,083
It's the story of Oiwa.

592
01:07:35,083 --> 01:07:36,458
It's an old one.

593
01:07:37,666 --> 01:07:39,125
A tragedy.

594
01:07:41,208 --> 01:07:44,333
You don't know me.

595
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:53,541
Yeah. I'm dying.

596
01:07:57,083 --> 01:07:58,833
Poisoned, the ghost of Oiwa

597
01:07:59,791 --> 01:08:02,875
returns to avenge her death.

598
01:08:04,416 --> 01:08:06,541
But these endeavors, they're never simple.

599
01:08:08,458 --> 01:08:10,083
Not when it comes to family.

600
01:08:16,375 --> 01:08:18,375
Was it revenge for Osaka?

601
01:08:20,791 --> 01:08:22,000
Why do you think that?

602
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:26,916
What do I have to gain
from your death now?

603
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:29,750
You are an instrument.

604
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:31,708
You do not matter to me.

605
01:08:33,333 --> 01:08:36,666
Only my family does.

606
01:08:38,416 --> 01:08:40,958
Kentaro, your brother...

607
01:08:43,916 --> 01:08:46,083
He's dead not because of you...

608
01:08:48,083 --> 01:08:49,500
but because I failed...

609
01:08:51,916 --> 01:08:55,375
to see envy taking root in my own family.

610
01:08:57,125 --> 01:08:59,833
The Western disease spreading

611
01:09:01,083 --> 01:09:03,875
like cancer within one of mine.

612
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:07,875
Renji.

613
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,916
Renji couldn't become the head of the clan
without outside help.

614
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:36,541
They could not allow you
to live to tell the tale.

615
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:39,666
That's why you're standing here.

616
01:09:41,375 --> 01:09:44,333
Seems we were both
betrayed by our families.

617
01:10:00,166 --> 01:10:01,166
Hi.

618
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,083
Get lost.

619
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:05,291
Yeah.

620
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:10,458
You know, I... I thought
I had the coolest bracelets.

621
01:10:10,541 --> 01:10:12,666
I realize now
you have the coolest bracelet.

622
01:10:15,416 --> 01:10:16,791
I have a gun, you know.

623
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:18,791
Well, good for you.

624
01:10:19,416 --> 01:10:21,375
Your parents raised you right.

625
01:10:21,458 --> 01:10:23,666
Yeah, you don't know
shit about my parents,

626
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:24,958
so just fuck off.

627
01:10:25,541 --> 01:10:28,208
Well, I know
it couldn't have been easy to lose 'em.

628
01:10:29,666 --> 01:10:33,791
You know,
I lost someone that I love a lot.

629
01:10:34,666 --> 01:10:35,666
And you know her.

630
01:10:39,208 --> 01:10:40,208
Kate?

631
01:10:42,333 --> 01:10:44,500
Hmm. Maybe my best friend.

632
01:10:45,416 --> 01:10:46,416
And, uh...

633
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:51,875
I'm very worried about her.

634
01:10:51,958 --> 01:10:53,458
"Friends."

635
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:56,583
I didn't know Kate had any stupid friends.

636
01:10:57,083 --> 01:10:58,875
Well, she's got you,
doesn't she?

637
01:11:00,458 --> 01:11:02,500
But you're right.

638
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:06,583
She and I
aren't really friends, more family.

639
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,125
You expected loyalty?

640
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:13,333
As did I.

641
01:11:14,541 --> 01:11:15,583
Instead,

642
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:22,583
we are getting what we deserve.

643
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,583
No, but Varrick, he's... he's...

644
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,208
A smug Westerner.

645
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:36,875
It's their way to take and take

646
01:11:36,958 --> 01:11:38,666
until there's nothing left.

647
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,833
To gorge on cultures
they don't understand

648
01:11:43,916 --> 01:11:46,116
and then evacuate their bowels
on the rest of the world.

649
01:11:52,416 --> 01:11:54,500
Pity is what I feel for you now.

650
01:11:57,416 --> 01:12:00,833
Used by him your entire life,

651
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:03,708
and now you're dying for his sins.

652
01:12:05,416 --> 01:12:11,666
Have you ever wondered
about Kate's obsession with your family?

653
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:14,666
You mean my... my uncle?

654
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:18,125
Yeah, sure. Him too.

655
01:12:20,416 --> 01:12:21,416
Sorry.

656
01:12:23,166 --> 01:12:26,375
I know you've been through a lot.

657
01:12:27,875 --> 01:12:29,041
What do you mean?

658
01:12:30,708 --> 01:12:33,916
Kate ever share with you

659
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,666
what she did in Osaka
when she first met you?

660
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:43,166
I know now,
as an old man burdened by his mistakes...

661
01:12:46,666 --> 01:12:48,708
that my biggest regret is...

662
01:12:50,958 --> 01:12:54,083
...abandoning the one innocent soul,
my little Ani

663
01:12:54,958 --> 01:12:59,500
when she needed me the most.

664
01:13:08,958 --> 01:13:10,708
I have to finish this.

665
01:13:12,416 --> 01:13:15,416
I'm dying. I have to finish...
I have to finish something.

666
01:13:18,083 --> 01:13:21,791
Death is the time for the beginnings.

667
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:31,383
You will let me retain my honor.

668
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:47,000
We deserve the comeuppance,

669
01:13:47,083 --> 01:13:48,625
and I am ready to atone.

670
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:52,333
Are you?

671
01:14:15,541 --> 01:14:16,791
No, no, no.

672
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:19,125
No, Ani. Ani, no...

673
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:21,083
You lied to me!

674
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:23,708
I killed someone for you.

675
01:14:24,875 --> 01:14:27,375
- Ani...
- You killed my whole family.

676
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:29,833
You... you bitch!

677
01:14:29,916 --> 01:14:33,875
No, please. Just shoot me if you want
but just don't get in that car, okay?

678
01:14:33,958 --> 01:14:36,208
Look at me. Look at me. I'm begging you.

679
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,726
Look, you're stronger than I am, okay?
You don't have to end up here...

680
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:44,791
Just shut the fuck up!
I have nothing left, okay?

681
01:14:45,875 --> 01:14:47,809
It's what they do.
You and me, we're collateral...

682
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:24,750
Now what?

683
01:15:26,291 --> 01:15:27,416
Now,

684
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:30,666
you start the rest of your life.

685
01:15:37,291 --> 01:15:39,166
<i> You start the rest of your life.</i>

686
01:15:39,958 --> 01:15:43,916
I know how much you must be
hurting right now, losing your parents.

687
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:46,625
<i>But it's gonna be okay.</i>

688
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:50,458
<i>I repeat, take the shot.</i>

689
01:15:50,541 --> 01:15:52,501
<i> The gun was empty.</i>

690
01:15:52,541 --> 01:15:54,250
It's empty!

691
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:56,666
I know.

692
01:15:57,833 --> 01:16:00,875
Shoot 'em in the stomach,
they die slow, in agony.

693
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:03,333
And they know it's personal.

694
01:16:03,416 --> 01:16:04,416
Let's go.

695
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,250
Breathe.

696
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:08,250
<i>Breathe.</i>

697
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:10,833
<i> Are you gonna
let that pain overwhelm you?</i>

698
01:16:13,833 --> 01:16:15,625
<i>Control you?</i>

699
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:18,041
<i> This is so cool.</i>

700
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:22,208
Maybe you can embrace it.

701
01:16:23,416 --> 01:16:25,583
<i>And let it empower you.</i>

702
01:16:49,541 --> 01:16:51,166
You dropped this.

703
01:16:57,041 --> 01:16:58,958
Death is a beginning, yes?

704
01:17:32,416 --> 01:17:33,333
Renji?

705
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:35,333
What is she doing here?

706
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:39,166
She's the future. Mine at least.

707
01:17:40,208 --> 01:17:41,208
Ani, sit.

708
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:52,958
You went after my girl
without my permission.

709
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:56,083
I could fucking kill you right now.

710
01:17:58,416 --> 01:18:00,625
And destroy your own operation?

711
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:03,916
My issue is not with my operation.

712
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,916
It's with you taking it on yourself.

713
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,125
You ordered her termination.

714
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:12,666
"If she's leaving, I will terminate her."

715
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:15,125
Your words exactly.

716
01:18:19,208 --> 01:18:20,208
"If."

717
01:18:20,916 --> 01:18:21,958
I said "if."

718
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,750
Key word, "if."

719
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:29,291
She was coming back.

720
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:31,125
I just had to work it.

721
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:33,250
I was working it.

722
01:18:35,375 --> 01:18:37,083
She would have changed her mind.

723
01:18:37,166 --> 01:18:38,916
I would have changed my mind.

724
01:18:41,291 --> 01:18:43,958
Polonium-204?

725
01:18:44,833 --> 01:18:46,291
Fuck you!

726
01:18:55,166 --> 01:18:56,916
Your girl had to die.

727
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,416
That was always the deal, Varrick-san.

728
01:19:00,083 --> 01:19:03,125
After Kentaro's death,
all eyes were on me.

729
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:07,541
I panicked.
I moved too quickly, and I'm sorry.

730
01:19:25,333 --> 01:19:26,333
Yeah.

731
01:19:27,458 --> 01:19:29,583
You know what? You blundered, I blundered.

732
01:19:30,958 --> 01:19:32,041
Let's, uh...

733
01:19:33,416 --> 01:19:36,500
Maybe we do our best
to put this behind us.

734
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,333
In the name of being human.

735
01:19:40,583 --> 01:19:42,083
I prefer self-interest.

736
01:19:43,041 --> 01:19:44,458
I trust it more.

737
01:19:48,875 --> 01:19:51,750
I can't say I can trust you going forward.

738
01:19:53,625 --> 01:19:55,375
Trust was not a part of the deal.

739
01:19:57,875 --> 01:19:58,916
Neither is friendship.

740
01:20:00,125 --> 01:20:02,750
Welcome to the yakuza, Varrick-san.

741
01:20:14,916 --> 01:20:17,184
I will handle
my family business personally.

742
01:20:18,583 --> 01:20:19,791
As will I.

743
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:24,000
This is impossible in your condition.

744
01:20:25,833 --> 01:20:30,666
The shot bought me another hour.

745
01:20:33,666 --> 01:20:35,333
It will be an hour in hell.

746
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:40,875
She's worth it.

747
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:56,583
You...

748
01:20:58,291 --> 01:21:00,916
are a dishonorable killer, are you not?

749
01:21:02,833 --> 01:21:04,125
Not tonight.

750
01:21:32,291 --> 01:21:33,666
Boom Boom Lemon?

751
01:21:58,375 --> 01:21:59,666
Let's go get Ani.

752
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,420
<i> Alpha-six,
camera two is down.</i>

753
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:27,916
<i>I repeat, camera two is down.</i>

754
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,240
- <i>Four to Alpha-six.</i>
- What do we do?

755
01:23:30,916 --> 01:23:35,583
Well, we, uh, call up the teams,
form a barricade around the crystal box.

756
01:23:35,666 --> 01:23:37,041
Bring up the kid.

757
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:40,291
And, uh, you know,
we'll hole up in there. Move!

758
01:23:40,375 --> 01:23:41,625
Which teams, sir?

759
01:23:42,458 --> 01:23:43,541
All of 'em!

760
01:23:55,375 --> 01:23:57,166
Go, go, go, go, go!

761
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:02,333
Uh-oh.

762
01:24:03,458 --> 01:24:04,458
Asshole.

763
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:07,625
- <i>Bring up the girl.</i>
- Copy that.

764
01:24:07,708 --> 01:24:10,166
- Let's go. Move!
- Hey! Easy, cowboy.

765
01:25:06,541 --> 01:25:07,541
Fuck!

766
01:26:16,583 --> 01:26:19,166
Okay, Renji. You ain't coming with.

767
01:26:21,916 --> 01:26:23,625
You take care of Kijima.

768
01:26:23,708 --> 01:26:25,291
You guys, stay with him.

769
01:26:25,833 --> 01:26:27,666
You guys, come with me. Good luck.

770
01:27:00,166 --> 01:27:01,916
You want to be the Oyabun?

771
01:27:16,125 --> 01:27:17,291
I'm right here.

772
01:27:41,458 --> 01:27:43,416
Don't talk down to me.

773
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:46,500
Eh? You're no samurai.

774
01:27:46,583 --> 01:27:48,375
You are nothing but a fucking thug.

775
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:53,041
I'm not hiding from it anymore.

776
01:27:53,125 --> 01:27:55,000
I'm a businessman.

777
01:27:58,625 --> 01:28:00,625
Times changed.

778
01:28:00,708 --> 01:28:02,541
You got old.

779
01:28:02,625 --> 01:28:05,708
I am the future. Eh?

780
01:28:05,791 --> 01:28:07,333
Things are different now!

781
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:37,125
Bravo, Kate.

782
01:30:39,041 --> 01:30:40,166
Never doubted you.

783
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:42,208
Ani...

784
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:44,250
I'm sor...

785
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:46,708
Ani, I'm sorry.

786
01:30:52,375 --> 01:30:53,708
I'd do anything to un...

787
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:58,041
to undo it, to take it all back.

788
01:30:58,125 --> 01:31:00,750
Can't go back, sadly.

789
01:31:01,375 --> 01:31:02,291
Please.

790
01:31:02,375 --> 01:31:04,833
Be nice right now
for both of us, wouldn't it?

791
01:31:04,916 --> 01:31:08,625
Ani, I'd give anything to take it back.
I'd take it all back. I'm so sorry.

792
01:31:08,708 --> 01:31:12,166
But guess we gotta just accept
who we are now.

793
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:15,541
And you know, Kate, that we are...

794
01:31:15,625 --> 01:31:16,625
Tools.

795
01:31:18,208 --> 01:31:22,041
Well, I was gonna say
"indispensable parts of a system."

796
01:31:22,125 --> 01:31:24,291
That you created and controlled.

797
01:31:25,208 --> 01:31:27,208
A necessary system, Kate.

798
01:31:27,291 --> 01:31:30,041
One that cannot accommodate dissent.

799
01:31:33,625 --> 01:31:37,750
I promise you
it is not what you think it is.

800
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,958
It turns out nothing ever was.

801
01:31:42,916 --> 01:31:44,750
And I'm not looking away anymore.

802
01:31:49,708 --> 01:31:51,000
Oh.

803
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:53,875
Down your guns.

804
01:31:53,958 --> 01:31:58,291
I see. In the 25th hour,
you suddenly grew a conscience.

805
01:31:59,875 --> 01:32:01,333
Don't do this, Varrick.

806
01:32:01,416 --> 01:32:03,291
Don't you do this, Kate.

807
01:32:03,375 --> 01:32:07,916
My entire fucking life,
I never loved anyone, except you.

808
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,291
Come on, V.

809
01:32:12,041 --> 01:32:14,125
We both know you only love yourself.

810
01:32:21,041 --> 01:32:22,041
Life had such...

811
01:32:23,916 --> 01:32:25,875
big things waiting for you.

812
01:32:28,208 --> 01:32:29,791
My life wasn't mine.

813
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:33,541
Till now.

814
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:57,708
It's okay. It's okay. Go on. Okay.

815
01:33:17,083 --> 01:33:18,083
Great shot.

816
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:57,000
I got you.

817
01:34:28,541 --> 01:34:30,583
Hey, hey.

818
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:33,083
Yeah. It's okay.

819
01:34:35,291 --> 01:34:36,583
I know you.

820
01:34:53,375 --> 01:34:57,208
No, no. No, no. No, no.

821
01:35:30,041 --> 01:35:32,125
It's okay.

821
01:35:33,305 --> 01:36:33,835
