00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,411
"Alexandria".

3
00:01:23,597 --> 00:01:24,923
Goodbye.

4
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,043
Goodbye.

5
00:02:01,857 --> 00:02:04,228
Goodbye.

6
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:28,847
Mom...

7
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:30,504
Can I keep her stick?

8
00:02:31,502 --> 00:02:32,637
Yes.

9
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,624
Put your belt on, Nelly.

10
00:04:18,026 --> 00:04:19,121
Say goodbye.

11
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:21,555
I said goodbye.

12
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:45,365
- Aperitif time?
- Yes.

13
00:06:14,012 --> 00:06:15,164
We have arrived.

14
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:28,930
- Where's your room?
- It's this one, on the right.

15
00:07:31,286 --> 00:07:34,211
There's the fridge, if you want
to put it in the cellar.

16
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,742
Wow I can't move it.

17
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:40,170
We shouldn't start here anyway.

18
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,599
- Hi.
- Hi.

19
00:07:55,086 --> 00:07:56,841
Where did you make your hut, mom?

20
00:07:58,717 --> 00:08:00,230
In the woods, just behind the house.

21
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:01,317
Will you show it to me?

22
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,868
I have work to do here.

23
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:08,525
There are three or four trees?

24
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:12,030
- Four
- Like a square.

25
00:08:13,163 --> 00:08:14,163
Yes.

26
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,877
I want to build one too.

27
00:08:19,154 --> 00:08:20,154
Which hut?

28
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:23,013
Mom's hut when she was a little girl.

29
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,316
He forgot about it.

30
00:08:32,718 --> 00:08:34,737
We painted the wall
around this cupboard.

31
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:37,423
Do you remember that, Marion?

32
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,357
I remember.

33
00:08:52,022 --> 00:08:53,142
I'm going out.

34
00:11:02,558 --> 00:11:03,730
What's that?

35
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:05,273
My stuff when I was a kid.

36
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,977
She had kept everything.

37
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,769
She was not very good at spelling.

38
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,065
- You were a good drawer.
- You think so?

39
00:11:26,514 --> 00:11:28,696
Look at this smoking fox,
it's well drawn.

40
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,286
Yeah, it's looking good.

41
00:11:35,973 --> 00:11:38,049
I'm depressed just having
to bring all this home.

42
00:12:12,596 --> 00:12:14,132
I went into the woods too.

43
00:12:17,164 --> 00:12:18,269
Time to go to bed.

44
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:33,000
Does it hurt you to be here?

45
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,105
I liked that room.

46
00:12:36,953 --> 00:12:38,505
But I didn't like it at night.

47
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:40,905
- Why?
- Children's matter.

48
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:44,134
I'm a child, I'm interested.

49
00:12:44,844 --> 00:12:47,039
It's bedtime for all children.

50
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,696
You always ask questions
when you have to go to bed.

51
00:12:51,163 --> 00:12:52,525
That's when I can see you.

52
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:10,556
You have to wait.

53
00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:12,319
Wait for what?

54
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,385
Wait for your eyes to
get used to the darkness.

55
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:18,468
That's when it appears.

56
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:22,316
The black panther.
At the end of your bed.

57
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,530
I could hear its heart
beating in my pillow.

58
00:13:29,987 --> 00:13:31,213
Louder and louder.

59
00:13:31,883 --> 00:13:33,025
But it was just mine.

60
00:13:41,435 --> 00:13:43,644
- Do you see it?
- No.

61
00:13:45,788 --> 00:13:46,828
I don't see it either.

62
00:15:17,753 --> 00:15:19,039
I'm sad too.

63
00:15:20,672 --> 00:15:21,672
Tell me...

64
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:23,605
I didn't say goodbye to her.

65
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
You always said goodbye.

66
00:15:27,463 --> 00:15:29,463
The last goodbye was not good.

67
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:33,330
That's because I couldn't know.

68
00:15:35,255 --> 00:15:37,303
She couldn't know either.

69
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,681
We don't know about that.

70
00:15:39,996 --> 00:15:41,939
You're right.
We don't know.

71
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,826
How would you have
wanted to say goodbye?

72
00:15:54,302 --> 00:15:55,302
Goodbye.

73
00:16:01,207 --> 00:16:02,207
Goodbye.

74
00:16:41,353 --> 00:16:42,353
Wait.

75
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,162
I slept in the living room.

76
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,381
- With mom.
- Yes, she told me about that.

77
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:11,333
She's sad.

78
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:15,173
I know.

79
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:19,400
She decided to leave this morning.

80
00:17:20,438 --> 00:17:22,115
We thought it would be better.

81
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,878
- I have a mission for you.
- What mission?

82
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,439
The cupboard in the hall.

83
00:17:34,216 --> 00:17:36,301
After that we leave quickly
from here to see her.

84
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,163
Dad? What's that thing?

85
00:18:30,497 --> 00:18:32,063
It's a paddleball.

86
00:18:34,592 --> 00:18:36,097
You hit the ball and it comes back.

87
00:18:39,534 --> 00:18:40,896
So it's meant to be
played alone.

88
00:18:41,297 --> 00:18:42,677
Yes, in a way.

89
00:18:44,592 --> 00:18:45,639
Perfect.

90
00:20:04,418 --> 00:20:05,770
Will you help me?

91
00:21:28,864 --> 00:21:29,959
What's your name?

92
00:21:31,131 --> 00:21:32,131
Marion.

93
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:38,159
Come.

94
00:22:38,188 --> 00:22:39,347
Give me your sweater.

95
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:32,925
Do you want something to drink?

96
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:38,473
Yes

97
00:24:16,274 --> 00:24:17,293
Take a seat.

98
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:26,731
You didn't tell me your name.

99
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:28,340
Nelly.

100
00:24:29,493 --> 00:24:30,826
I'd never seen you before.

101
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,332
I am at my grandmother's house.

102
00:24:33,856 --> 00:24:35,170
Who's your grandmother?

103
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,789
She died last week.

104
00:24:38,313 --> 00:24:39,484
We're emptying the house.

105
00:25:20,053 --> 00:25:22,615
I like to eat chocolate like that.

106
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:33,824
My grandmother died last year.

107
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,938
She had the same name as you.

108
00:25:43,948 --> 00:25:45,740
The bathroom is at the
end of the hallway?

109
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,090
Yes.

110
00:27:08,874 --> 00:27:10,112
Are you leaving?

111
00:27:13,171 --> 00:27:14,171
Yes.

112
00:27:15,857 --> 00:27:17,123
My family must be worried.

113
00:27:18,594 --> 00:27:20,151
Ok, bye.

114
00:27:21,257 --> 00:27:22,257
Bye.

115
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,322
Dad?

116
00:28:05,355 --> 00:28:06,480
Yeah.

117
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,577
Are you okay?

118
00:28:17,141 --> 00:28:18,577
I was afraid you were gone.

119
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,149
I'm here.

120
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:26,727
You put your sweater on backwards.
Take it off.

121
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,985
Did you like playing paddleball?

122
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,023
The elastic's broken
and I didn't find the ball.

123
00:28:45,937 --> 00:28:47,975
I found the place where
Mom built her hut.

124
00:28:48,765 --> 00:28:50,402
The trees were as
she had described them

125
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:53,793
Don't you remember it at all?

126
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:56,073
No.

127
00:28:57,063 --> 00:28:59,149
The one she built just
before her operation.

128
00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:05,471
You didn't really forget,
you just didn't listen to her.

129
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:08,443
You're right.

130
00:29:09,338 --> 00:29:10,547
That's a nice rope.

131
00:29:10,747 --> 00:29:13,023
I'm glad you like it,
but that's mine!

132
00:29:13,048 --> 00:29:15,566
- I'm gonna use it to pack the books.
- But it's so long.

133
00:31:48,301 --> 00:31:49,365
Good.

134
00:31:51,317 --> 00:31:52,956
I cut here...

135
00:32:00,887 --> 00:32:02,706
A little more. Hold it.

136
00:32:33,987 --> 00:32:35,487
How old are you?

137
00:32:36,651 --> 00:32:37,750
I'm eight. And you?

138
00:32:38,761 --> 00:32:39,826
The same.

139
00:32:40,363 --> 00:32:41,863
Any brothers and sisters?

140
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,520
No. I'd like some.

141
00:32:43,847 --> 00:32:45,017
Me too.

142
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:54,355
Are you thirsty?

143
00:33:03,952 --> 00:33:05,885
How long are you staying here?

144
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,943
I don't know.
The time it takes to clear the house.

145
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:12,489
We could do stuff together.

146
00:33:13,044 --> 00:33:14,674
I have to go home now.

147
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,124
Ok.

148
00:33:17,543 --> 00:33:19,154
What are you going to do?

149
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:20,699
I don't know.

150
00:33:21,282 --> 00:33:22,782
Want to come with me?

151
00:33:34,751 --> 00:33:36,865
- What colour do you want?
- Blue.

152
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,741
Ten.

153
00:33:45,463 --> 00:33:46,491
Three.

154
00:33:49,464 --> 00:33:50,464
Six.

155
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:56,978
"Each player picks a goose."

156
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:58,236
Where's the six?

157
00:33:59,586 --> 00:34:02,264
You skip a turn, I play twice...

158
00:34:03,134 --> 00:34:04,134
Five.

159
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,159
One, two, three, four, five.

160
00:34:09,164 --> 00:34:10,164
Eight.

161
00:34:10,893 --> 00:34:14,082
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

162
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:16,929
Six.

163
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:19,325
One, two, three, four, five, six.

164
00:34:19,452 --> 00:34:20,518
Hi!

165
00:34:20,585 --> 00:34:24,518
"You're in the dungeon.
Back to square one."

166
00:34:24,528 --> 00:34:25,528
No!

167
00:34:28,944 --> 00:34:30,219
Hello.

168
00:34:32,774 --> 00:34:33,841
Hello, ma'am.

169
00:34:35,443 --> 00:34:36,844
Did you go out, Marion?

170
00:34:38,357 --> 00:34:39,528
I was careful.

171
00:34:40,652 --> 00:34:43,538
The doctor will tell you again later.
He's less patient than me.

172
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:45,766
We won't tell him.

173
00:34:55,772 --> 00:34:57,309
We leave in an hour.

174
00:35:11,685 --> 00:35:13,457
I'm having an operation soon.

175
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:18,429
Ok.

176
00:35:19,915 --> 00:35:23,457
If they don't do it now, I'll have
my mom's problem when I grow up.

177
00:35:25,179 --> 00:35:26,341
When's the operation?

178
00:35:27,322 --> 00:35:28,446
In three days.

179
00:36:02,121 --> 00:36:03,788
What's up?
You look miles away.

180
00:36:04,446 --> 00:36:06,159
I think I've made a new friend.

181
00:36:07,428 --> 00:36:09,150
Do you mind if I smoke?

182
00:36:09,656 --> 00:36:10,969
It's bad for you, but go on.

183
00:36:11,693 --> 00:36:12,770
Thanks.

184
00:36:23,964 --> 00:36:27,107
- Can I sleep at her place?
- When?

185
00:36:28,097 --> 00:36:29,668
I don't know,
she didn't invite me yet.

186
00:36:32,545 --> 00:36:34,383
We are still here for two or three days.

187
00:36:36,668 --> 00:36:38,945
You're allowed to sleep
at her place if she invites you.

188
00:36:39,668 --> 00:36:41,478
But don't go there uninvited.

189
00:36:44,897 --> 00:36:46,687
Did Mom's operation go well?

190
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,030
She told you about it, didn't she?

191
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,477
Yes, but she may not have told everything.

192
00:36:55,373 --> 00:36:57,373
We never talk about your childhood.

193
00:36:58,162 --> 00:37:00,019
We talk about that all the time.

194
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,872
Yes, but that's just short stories

195
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,268
What do you mean by that?

196
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:09,687
I know every Christmas present you had,
or the fact that you loved pizza...

197
00:37:10,736 --> 00:37:12,136
I don't know about the real things.

198
00:37:13,707 --> 00:37:15,298
What do you mean by "real things"?

199
00:37:15,888 --> 00:37:17,671
The things you were afraid of, for example.

200
00:37:18,783 --> 00:37:20,992
I was afraid of many things
like everyone else.

201
00:37:22,403 --> 00:37:23,592
Tell me about one thing.

202
00:37:33,882 --> 00:37:35,348
Have you forgotten?

203
00:37:37,091 --> 00:37:38,777
No, I have not.

204
00:37:45,737 --> 00:37:47,556
I was afraid of my father.

205
00:39:01,479 --> 00:39:02,631
How will you die?

206
00:39:03,205 --> 00:39:04,592
Stabbed in my sleep.

207
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,240
And why will you be killed?

208
00:39:06,912 --> 00:39:07,992
For the money.

209
00:39:08,192 --> 00:39:10,992
I come from United States but I
own a Coca Cola factory in France.

210
00:39:12,363 --> 00:39:13,596
So you're very rich.

211
00:39:14,781 --> 00:39:16,061
I'm fine, yes.

212
00:39:16,606 --> 00:39:18,570
Then again, there's the crisis.

213
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:21,577
Okay, so who else would
you want to be?

214
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,580
The Inspector.

215
00:39:23,566 --> 00:39:25,433
I'm going to be the Countess.

216
00:39:27,913 --> 00:39:29,326
So you also play...

217
00:39:29,689 --> 00:39:31,481
the Countess's son,

218
00:39:33,058 --> 00:39:34,215
and the maid.

219
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:38,437
I'll also play the Inspector's wife.

220
00:39:40,213 --> 00:39:41,799
And the reporter

221
00:39:42,343 --> 00:39:45,546
No, otherwise there will be no scene
between the reporter and the countess.

222
00:39:55,158 --> 00:39:57,159
I play more characters than you.

223
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,831
It's fine, because I have a big role.

224
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,372
Could you help me with the tie?

225
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:01,352
Of course.

226
00:41:02,725 --> 00:41:03,725
Come here.

227
00:41:34,854 --> 00:41:35,894
There you go.

228
00:41:38,501 --> 00:41:39,501
Thanks.

229
00:41:47,804 --> 00:41:48,804
"Bulb".

230
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,702
Where?

231
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,230
Here.

232
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,856
So here it's...

233
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,559
"Ablution".

234
00:42:28,028 --> 00:42:29,564
Here, there's "zone".

235
00:42:31,414 --> 00:42:32,941
You're quite good at your age.

236
00:42:51,342 --> 00:42:52,863
Would you give me
that glass of water?

237
00:42:58,017 --> 00:42:59,057
Thanks Nelly.

238
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,544
It's been a long time
since I've said that name.

239
00:43:12,209 --> 00:43:14,009
I went to bed at 9.

240
00:43:14,729 --> 00:43:16,070
It was still daylight.

241
00:43:16,442 --> 00:43:18,118
And when I woke up,

242
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,276
He was lying dead next to me.

243
00:43:20,896 --> 00:43:22,894
He died between 3 AM and 6 AM.

244
00:43:24,028 --> 00:43:26,076
So, did you really not
notice anything wrong?

245
00:43:26,516 --> 00:43:28,369
He was quite worried lately.

246
00:43:28,456 --> 00:43:30,656
He was facing problems at the factory.

247
00:43:30,723 --> 00:43:31,962
What kind of problems?

248
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,068
I don't know, he was secretive.

249
00:43:34,627 --> 00:43:35,666
What about you?

250
00:43:35,876 --> 00:43:36,876
Me?

251
00:43:37,747 --> 00:43:38,979
Are you secretive?

252
00:43:40,759 --> 00:43:42,182
You know... A secret...

253
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:44,511
It's not necessarily
a thing you want to hide.

254
00:43:44,753 --> 00:43:46,833
It's just that you don't
have anyone to tell them to.

255
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,640
I'm listening.

256
00:43:52,056 --> 00:43:53,349
You play very well!

257
00:43:53,516 --> 00:43:54,516
You too.

258
00:43:55,146 --> 00:43:56,743
I would like to be an actress.

259
00:43:58,624 --> 00:43:59,673
Really?

260
00:44:01,186 --> 00:44:02,186
Yes.

261
00:44:02,478 --> 00:44:03,493
It's my dream.

262
00:44:05,731 --> 00:44:06,771
You could become one.

263
00:44:07,616 --> 00:44:09,345
- You think so?
- Yes.

264
00:44:16,513 --> 00:44:20,200
I'm tired of staying inside.
Can't we go to your place?

265
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,473
Not possible.

266
00:44:22,971 --> 00:44:23,973
Why?

267
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,713
A bad atmosphere.

268
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:28,773
That's because of your grandmother?

269
00:44:29,886 --> 00:44:30,887
No.

270
00:44:31,459 --> 00:44:32,580
My mom left.

271
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,150
Why?

272
00:44:34,474 --> 00:44:35,498
Dunno.

273
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:40,553
I'm sure she'll come back.

274
00:44:42,776 --> 00:44:44,568
Are you afraid for the operation?

275
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,707
Yes.

276
00:44:49,763 --> 00:44:51,302
Ask her if you can come...

277
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,119
to my place, but meet me in the hut.

278
00:44:58,898 --> 00:45:01,458
I'm glad we've met.

279
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,050
Are you okay?

280
00:45:26,163 --> 00:45:28,156
I've decided to make one
of your dreams come true.

281
00:45:29,136 --> 00:45:30,149
Which one?

282
00:45:31,363 --> 00:45:32,398
Well, guess.

283
00:45:32,423 --> 00:45:33,489
Cutting your beard.

284
00:45:44,008 --> 00:45:46,367
This old school stuff is cool,
I wanted to try it.

285
00:45:53,325 --> 00:45:54,331
Close your mouth.

286
00:46:43,171 --> 00:46:44,471
Hi.

287
00:46:51,227 --> 00:46:52,507
You're handsome.

288
00:46:52,926 --> 00:46:53,986
Thank you.

289
00:46:56,666 --> 00:46:59,046
- Are these the books you want to keep?
- Yes.

290
00:47:00,957 --> 00:47:03,144
- You want me to read you one tonight?
- No.

291
00:47:03,911 --> 00:47:05,777
I want to sleep because
I can't wait tomorrow.

292
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:08,761
So we activate the time acceleration?

293
00:47:12,591 --> 00:47:13,591
Ready?

294
00:47:13,704 --> 00:47:14,704
Ready.

295
00:47:36,138 --> 00:47:38,492
Thanks, it's better
than I imagined.

296
00:47:40,912 --> 00:47:41,932
Marion?

297
00:47:48,382 --> 00:47:49,662
I have a secret.

298
00:47:50,172 --> 00:47:51,277
Well, it's not only mine.

299
00:47:52,582 --> 00:47:53,867
I'll tell you too.

300
00:47:54,858 --> 00:47:56,553
You have to know it.

301
00:47:57,658 --> 00:47:59,115
What's going on?

302
00:48:01,913 --> 00:48:03,960
Promise me you'll believe me.

303
00:48:07,408 --> 00:48:08,779
I'll believe you.

304
00:48:13,149 --> 00:48:14,673
I'm your child.

305
00:48:16,368 --> 00:48:17,568
I'm your daughter.

306
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:27,216
So you come from the future?

307
00:48:29,988 --> 00:48:32,006
I come from this path behind you.

308
00:48:36,892 --> 00:48:38,282
Show me.

309
00:50:35,926 --> 00:50:37,478
How old am I?

310
00:50:38,965 --> 00:50:40,136

311
310
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:45,032
She dies when I'm 31.

312
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:47,117
That's old.

313
00:50:49,268 --> 00:50:50,601
Not that old.

314
00:50:51,992 --> 00:50:54,344
She always talks about it
as if it were tomorrow.

315
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,963
Always.

316
00:51:00,008 --> 00:51:01,181
She said...

317
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,867
"This may be the last time
we see each other."

318
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:07,134
She already says that.

319
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:13,667
Have you kept her stick?

320
00:51:14,163 --> 00:51:15,163
Yes.

321
00:51:21,686 --> 00:51:23,134
It smells like her hand.

322
00:51:26,971 --> 00:51:28,600
You liked her a lot.

323
00:51:30,953 --> 00:51:32,562
Yes, very much.

324
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,260
Nelly?

325
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,897
That's my father.

326
00:51:45,164 --> 00:51:46,507
What are we going to do?

327
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,574
Go.

328
00:51:55,758 --> 00:51:57,406
It's done.

329
00:51:58,554 --> 00:52:00,346
We take our stuff and we can leave.

330
00:52:01,482 --> 00:52:02,918
I thought we were leaving tomorrow.

331
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:05,000
I thought that too but
I worked hard.

332
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,781
Can't we leave tomorrow morning?

333
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:11,181
Today's Mom's birthday.
It will be a nice surprise for her.

334
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,523
I don't understand you Nelly.

335
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,971
Aren't you eager to see her again?

336
00:52:16,381 --> 00:52:17,429
Yes, I am.

337
00:52:17,454 --> 00:52:18,923
So what's the problem then?

338
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,580
I wanted to stay one more night.

339
00:52:22,561 --> 00:52:23,895
Are you leaving?

340
00:52:27,761 --> 00:52:28,761
Yes.

341
00:52:29,714 --> 00:52:30,914
Hello.

342
00:52:31,244 --> 00:52:32,383
Hello.

343
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:36,701
I wanted to invite Nelly to
sleep at my place tonight.

344
00:52:37,425 --> 00:52:38,901
See? I've been invited.

345
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,644
I see.

346
00:52:42,177 --> 00:52:44,091
Why are you leaving now?

347
00:52:44,111 --> 00:52:45,616
I'm going to get back to Mom.

348
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:48,864
It's a shame, we were
going to make pancakes.

349
00:52:49,321 --> 00:52:50,721
Yes it's a shame.

350
00:52:52,768 --> 00:52:54,178
Another time.

351
00:53:08,009 --> 00:53:10,569
There won't be another time.

352
00:53:29,936 --> 00:53:31,517
Thank you.

353
00:53:59,812 --> 00:54:01,946
You've put way too much milk in it.

354
00:54:03,232 --> 00:54:04,708
It's fine.

355
00:54:04,733 --> 00:54:05,885
No it's not.

356
00:54:06,114 --> 00:54:07,828
It's not fine.

357
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:10,047
Wait, wait, wait...

358
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:42,359
You've got half a mustache.

359
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,753
Come in.

360
00:55:08,518 --> 00:55:09,943
You're late.

361
00:55:09,968 --> 00:55:11,229
Sorry.

362
00:55:11,505 --> 00:55:13,381
When was the last time?

363
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:16,734
One year ago.

364
00:55:20,001 --> 00:55:21,486
Are you hurt?

365
00:55:28,029 --> 00:55:29,305
An accident.

366
00:55:30,229 --> 00:55:32,448
You're hopeless, Inspector.

367
00:55:36,401 --> 00:55:37,896
I wanted to see you again.

368
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:40,100
I wanted to see you again too.

369
00:55:40,884 --> 00:55:41,886
Why?

370
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,705
You know very well.

371
00:55:44,222 --> 00:55:45,590
Tell me anyway.

372
00:55:46,005 --> 00:55:47,362
Because I love you.

373
00:55:49,952 --> 00:55:52,000
Come away with me.

374
00:55:54,265 --> 00:55:55,694
This won't be possible.

375
00:55:57,439 --> 00:56:00,275
I have family in New York,
we could start over.

376
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:04,427
Don't you want to know
why I've brought you here?

377
00:56:04,536 --> 00:56:05,536
Yes.

378
00:56:25,596 --> 00:56:27,472
Shh, shh, it's okay.

379
00:56:29,941 --> 00:56:31,414
This is our baby.

380
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:35,015
He's beautiful.

381
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:43,901
This is why I can't leave.

382
00:56:49,062 --> 00:56:50,357
He looks like you.

383
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,157
Come on girls.

384
00:58:06,995 --> 00:58:09,424
First the soup, then the party.

385
00:58:52,120 --> 00:59:00,101
<i>Happy birthday to you...
Happy birthday to you...</i>

386
00:59:00,948 --> 00:59:06,233
<i>Happy birthday to you Marion...</i>

387
00:59:06,471 --> 00:59:10,948
<i>Happy birthday to you...</i>

388
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:17,728
One more time.

389
00:59:47,409 --> 00:59:49,066
Why did she left?

390
00:59:53,457 --> 00:59:54,457
Your mom.

391
00:59:56,133 --> 00:59:57,475
She didn't tell me.

392
01:00:01,057 --> 01:00:02,866
What did your dad say?

393
01:00:04,152 --> 01:00:05,304
He doesn't say much.

394
01:00:06,095 --> 01:00:07,332
But he's sad.

395
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:13,396
I feel like...

396
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:16,485
...everyone has questions.

397
01:00:18,238 --> 01:00:19,238
You too?

398
01:00:20,847 --> 01:00:21,847
Yes.

399
01:00:25,266 --> 01:00:26,599
You were young when you had me.

400
01:00:28,371 --> 01:00:29,371
And?

401
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:34,636
I don't know.

402
01:00:35,472 --> 01:00:36,986
That's what you're telling to me.

403
01:00:37,511 --> 01:00:38,951
So, I'm listening.

404
01:00:41,911 --> 01:00:43,082
When?

405
01:00:44,111 --> 01:00:45,262

406
405
01:00:47,581 --> 01:00:48,918
Did I want to have you?

407
01:00:51,072 --> 01:00:52,072
Yes.

408
01:00:56,949 --> 01:00:58,389
I'm not surprised.

409
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:01,819
Because I'm already
thinking of you.

410
01:02:22,652 --> 01:02:23,843
What time is it?

411
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,262
7 AM

412
01:02:33,423 --> 01:02:35,281
When do you go to the hospital?

413
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:36,710
At 12.

414
01:02:50,271 --> 01:02:52,519
We have time to do one last thing together.

415
01:02:57,733 --> 01:02:59,357
Is it music from the future?

416
01:03:00,204 --> 01:03:01,204
Yes.

417
01:03:04,504 --> 01:03:05,846
Let me hear it.

418
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,341
Should I take some games?

419
01:06:06,865 --> 01:06:08,484
They must have some there.

420
01:06:09,515 --> 01:06:11,770
But will there be other
children to play with?

421
01:06:13,361 --> 01:06:14,361
Take them.

422
01:06:29,303 --> 01:06:30,703
Are you afraid?

423
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,427
Afraid of what?

424
01:06:33,303 --> 01:06:34,979
Afraid I won't come back.

425
01:06:38,227 --> 01:06:39,907
Everything will be fine.

426
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,512
I'm talking about the future.

427
01:06:43,008 --> 01:06:44,417
I'm talking about your mom.

428
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,808
Yes a bit.

429
01:06:48,095 --> 01:06:49,202
Why?

430
01:06:53,586 --> 01:06:55,469
Because you're often unhappy.

431
01:06:56,289 --> 01:06:58,174
You're not often happy to be here.

432
01:07:02,403 --> 01:07:04,527
I think it's not your fault.

433
01:07:06,034 --> 01:07:07,193
Do you think so?

434
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:09,958
Sometimes I think that.

435
01:07:17,128 --> 01:07:19,204
You didn't make me sad.

436
01:08:00,523 --> 01:08:03,037
- Goodbye
- Goodbye.

437
01:09:23,763 --> 01:09:25,151
Sorry.

438
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:27,626
For what?

439
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:30,217
I left you here.

440
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,084
Don't be sorry.

441
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,122
It was nice.

442
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:48,884
I wanted to see the place one last time.

443
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:01,693
- It feels weird.
- Yes.

444
01:10:12,236 --> 01:10:13,236
Marion?

445
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,951
Nelly.

448
01:10:23,305 --> 01:11:23,896
