2
00:00:28,186 --> 00:00:32,650
I'm going to get some flowers, dear.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

3
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,449
It's tulip season today,
and I'm so happy.

4
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,133
Come on, sweetie.

5
00:00:51,744 --> 00:00:55,578
Yes, come on now, sweetheart.

6
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:02,784
Go for a little ride,
then you can whiz all over the city.

7
00:01:04,258 --> 00:01:05,748
Go for a ride.

8
00:01:05,793 --> 00:01:08,420
Come on, sweetie.

9
00:01:10,097 --> 00:01:14,124
Freeze!
Leg down, leg down.

10
00:01:15,036 --> 00:01:19,132
That's it.
Come on now.

11
00:01:21,544 --> 00:01:24,638
No, you monkey-eared
son of a bitch!

12
00:01:24,547 --> 00:01:28,643
You have pissed your last floor.

13
00:01:29,852 --> 00:01:32,753
Bet you wish
you were a real dog.

14
00:01:33,956 --> 00:01:36,754
Oh, you dog-eared monkey.

15
00:01:39,564 --> 00:01:41,122
This is New York.If you can make it here.

16
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:43,827
you can make it anywhere...

17
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,995
you ugly, smelly...

18
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,172
- Verdell!
- Uh-oh.

19
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:02,349
Where's my good doggie?
Verdell?

20
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:06,512
Come here, sweetheart.

21
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,028
- Mr. Udall?
- Mm-hmm?

22
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,724
Have you seen Verdell?

23
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,628
What does he look like?

24
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:23,168
My dog. You know, my...

25
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:25,507
My dog with the little,
adorable face.

26
00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:29,311
Don't you know
what my dog looks like?

27
00:02:29,386 --> 00:02:32,081
Oh, I got it.
You were talking about your dog.

28
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:36,557
I thought it was the name
of that colored man I see in the hall.

29
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:40,595
Which color was that?

30
00:02:41,064 --> 00:02:44,033
Like thick molasses...

31
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,295
- with a broad nose...
- Frank!

32
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:49,196
perfect for smelling
trouble and prison food.

33
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:53,438
- Simon, you've got to get dressed.
- Frank Sachs, Melvin Udall.

34
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:54,839
How are you doin'?

35
00:02:55,146 --> 00:02:57,842
Frank shows my work,
Mr. Udall.

36
00:02:57,915 --> 00:03:00,110
- I think you know that.
- People are gonna start coming.

37
00:03:00,184 --> 00:03:04,552
What I know is that as long as you
keep your work zipped up around me...

38
00:03:04,622 --> 00:03:07,682
I don't give a rat crap
what or where you shove your show.

39
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:10,525
Are we done
being neighbors for now?

40
00:03:15,502 --> 00:03:17,663
- Let me talk to you...
- No! Not worth it.

41
00:03:17,668 --> 00:03:20,796
Definitely not worth it.
Verdell must be in the apartment.

42
00:03:22,273 --> 00:03:23,706
Okay.

43
00:03:25,042 --> 00:03:28,534
Hope you find him.
Love that dog.

44
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:32,975
You don't love anything,
Mr. Udall.

45
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:55,499
One, two, three, four, five.

46
00:03:57,142 --> 00:03:59,667
One, two, three, four, five.

47
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,943
Okay.

48
00:04:24,437 --> 00:04:27,167
Hot. Hot, hot, hot.

49
00:04:45,265 --> 00:04:48,394
- Hi, Carl.
- Frank, where is he?

50
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:50,527
- Isn't he here? He lives here.
- Take it easy.

51
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:53,437
- He had a little thing with the dog.
- It's not such a hot-looking dog.

52
00:04:53,507 --> 00:04:54,872
He's adorable.

53
00:04:54,943 --> 00:04:57,740
Who buys more than me?
He isn't the only one working.

54
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:01,372
Good Lord.
Where have you been?

55
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:06,384
Oh, look at my boy.

56
00:05:06,454 --> 00:05:09,150
Look at him.

57
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:15,423
- I found him, Mr. Bishop.
- I know you did. We know you did.

58
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:18,529
Where was my little baby?

59
00:05:18,602 --> 00:05:22,537
In the basement garbage bin
eating diaper shit.

60
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:30,707
- Go ahead,John. You earned your fun.
- Sorry. It just struck me.

61
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:33,409
- It's funny.
- Oh, wait.

62
00:05:35,052 --> 00:05:37,349
How did he get down
in the basement...

63
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,355
even if he got
in the elevator?

64
00:05:39,825 --> 00:05:44,023
Maybe some nice neighbor
shoved him down the garbage chute?

65
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:46,500
Somewhere in the dark...

66
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,626
Somewhere in the dark...

67
00:05:48,702 --> 00:05:52,467
she had confessed,
and he had forgiven.

68
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:55,440
"This is what you live for,"
he said.

69
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,377
"Two heads on a pillow,
where all is approval...

70
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:01,471
and there is only the safety...

71
00:06:01,548 --> 00:06:04,642
of being with each other."

72
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:08,119
How, she wondered,
could she find such hope...

73
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:10,214
in the most shameful part of her?

74
00:06:11,793 --> 00:06:16,024
At last she was able
to define love.

75
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:18,558
Love was...

76
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:21,624
Mr. Udall, I'd like
to speak to you, please.

77
00:06:21,704 --> 00:06:24,331
Let me do this by myself.

78
00:06:24,405 --> 00:06:27,568
- Love was...
- Are you in there?

79
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:28,973
Son of a bitch!

80
00:06:29,912 --> 00:06:32,243
Pansy-ass stool pusher.

81
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:34,043
Yes?

82
00:06:35,317 --> 00:06:38,080
Maybe this can wait.

83
00:06:38,153 --> 00:06:41,179
I found Verdell.

84
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:50,898
Well, that's a load off.

85
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:55,097
Uh-huh.
Did you do something to him?

86
00:06:55,171 --> 00:06:58,004
Do you realize
that I work at home?

87
00:06:59,943 --> 00:07:01,102
I wasn't aware.

88
00:07:01,177 --> 00:07:06,376
Do you like to be interrupted when
you're nancing around in your garden?

89
00:07:08,818 --> 00:07:11,480
No. I actually...

90
00:07:11,554 --> 00:07:14,489
will turn the ringer off on my phone
and put cardboard...

91
00:07:14,557 --> 00:07:17,424
Well, I work all the time...

92
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:21,726
so never, never interrupt me,
okay?

93
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:24,427
Not if there's a fire.

94
00:07:24,503 --> 00:07:26,767
Not even if you hear the sound
of a thud from my home...

95
00:07:26,837 --> 00:07:29,362
and one week later there's
a smell coming from there...

96
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,273
that can only be
a decaying human body...

97
00:07:32,344 --> 00:07:34,277
and you have to hold a hanky
to your face...

98
00:07:34,346 --> 00:07:37,576
because the stench is so thick
you think you're gonna faint.

99
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:40,914
Even then,
don't come knocking.

100
00:07:40,986 --> 00:07:44,251
Or if it's election night...

101
00:07:44,324 --> 00:07:47,019
and you're excited
and you want to celebrate...

102
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,150
because some fudge packer
you date...

103
00:07:49,228 --> 00:07:52,663
has been elected the first queer
president of the United States...

104
00:07:52,732 --> 00:07:55,325
and he's going to have you...

105
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,062
down to Camp David...

106
00:07:58,136 --> 00:08:01,265
and you want someone
to share the moment with.

107
00:08:01,341 --> 00:08:03,832
Even then...

108
00:08:03,877 --> 00:08:05,673
don't knock...

109
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:07,940
not on this door...

110
00:08:08,014 --> 00:08:11,279
not for any reason.

111
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:14,443
Do you get me, sweetheart?

112
00:08:16,757 --> 00:08:18,452
Yes.

113
00:08:18,525 --> 00:08:22,620
It's not a subtle point
that you're making.

114
00:08:23,864 --> 00:08:25,797
Okay then.

115
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:42,777
So the theory of confrontations says:
"Think twice before messing with me."

116
00:08:48,623 --> 00:08:50,557
All right.

117
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:54,328
Love was...

118
00:08:57,867 --> 00:08:59,800
What was love?

119
00:09:01,137 --> 00:09:03,070
Love was...

120
00:09:08,378 --> 00:09:12,337
Now I am pissed.
Now I am really pissed!

121
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,543
Don't touch! Don't touch!

122
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:19,747
Shut up! You think you can intimidate
the whole world with your attitude.

123
00:09:19,822 --> 00:09:23,223
You don't intimidate me.
I grew up in hell, homeboy.

124
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:25,556
My grandmother had more attitude.

125
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:29,190
Police!
Donut-munching morons.

126
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:32,463
Help me!

127
00:09:32,536 --> 00:09:34,333
Shut up!

128
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:36,896
Assault and battery,
and you're black!

129
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,502
I like Simon enough
to batter you unrecognizable...

130
00:09:41,578 --> 00:09:45,036
if you verbally abuse him
or touch that dog again.

131
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:51,619
Meantime...

132
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,147
I'm gonna think of some way
that you can make it up to him.

133
00:09:55,226 --> 00:09:56,955
I hate doing this!

134
00:09:57,028 --> 00:09:59,462
I'm an art dealer.

135
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:04,132
Have a nice day.
Okay, party!

136
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:27,324
- Excuse me.
- Whoa. Don't touch.

137
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,951
Get a life.

138
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,188
- Watch it.
- Don't touch.

139
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:44,100
- Look at you. You're all better.
- It's that new medication.

140
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:47,874
You know all my son's stuff, right?
No, no. I got a date tonight.

141
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:50,439
I'm walking out and he says,
"Mom, I promise not to get...

142
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:52,850
one of my fevers or coughs
during your date."

143
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,013
- Isn't that sweet?
- A little blond angel.

144
00:10:57,292 --> 00:11:00,556
It came out of me: "You love me
the way you love your remote control.

145
00:11:00,628 --> 00:11:03,290
As long as I switch every time
you press one of my buttons."

146
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:05,298
That's terrific.

147
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:08,426
People that talk in metaphors
oughta shampoo my crotch.

148
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:13,872
- Eat up.
- Stay there. I've got your money.

149
00:11:13,942 --> 00:11:16,102
- No, pay me next week.
- I owe you.

150
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:18,110
I told you today.
That's the rule.

151
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:20,204
- Excuse me, Melvin.
- Don't...

152
00:11:23,385 --> 00:11:26,514
- There you go. You take care.
- Thank you.

153
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,891
Pardon me.

154
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:34,553
Take the money.
Debts make me crazy.

155
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,030
This way you take a cab home
so you can get ready for the date.

156
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,898
Ready is not my problem.

157
00:11:40,971 --> 00:11:42,369
I'm starving.

158
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:45,738
Go on. Sit down. You know
you're not allowed back here.

159
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:47,571
Spence is more excited than I am.

160
00:11:47,644 --> 00:11:51,478
He says, "I promise not to get
a fever or cough during your date."

161
00:11:51,548 --> 00:11:55,177
Sometimes this kid,
you just want to...

162
00:11:55,252 --> 00:11:58,015
I've gotJews at my table.

163
00:11:58,088 --> 00:12:00,681
It's not your table.
It's the place's table. Behave.

164
00:12:00,757 --> 00:12:02,816
This once you can sit
at someone else's station.

165
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:06,756
Or you can wait your turn.

166
00:12:13,037 --> 00:12:15,436
- You have feelings for her?
- Well, yes.

167
00:12:15,506 --> 00:12:17,406
How much more you got to eat?

168
00:12:21,981 --> 00:12:25,609
Appetites aren't as big
as your noses, huh?

169
00:12:25,683 --> 00:12:27,947
- What?
- That's it. Forget it.

170
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,217
- Let me talk to him.
- I don't care how many books he sells.

171
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,747
- Give him one more chance. Here I go.
- Barred for life.

172
00:12:45,337 --> 00:12:48,397
- They left.
- Yeah. What do you know?

173
00:12:52,277 --> 00:12:54,404
Bryan says he doesn't care
how long you've been coming.

174
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:57,881
You ever act like this again,
you're barred for life.

175
00:12:57,951 --> 00:13:01,045
I'm gonna miss the excitement,
but I'll handle it.

176
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:04,819
Three eggs over easy...

177
00:13:04,891 --> 00:13:07,257
two sausage,
six strips of bacon with fries.

178
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:09,227
Fries today.

179
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:13,459
A short stack,
coffee with cream and sweetener.

180
00:13:13,534 --> 00:13:15,627
You're gonna die soon
with that diet.

181
00:13:16,704 --> 00:13:19,297
We're all gonna die soon.
I will, you will.

182
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:21,466
It sure sounds like
your son will.

183
00:13:39,728 --> 00:13:43,027
If you ever mention my son again...

184
00:13:43,098 --> 00:13:45,964
you will never be able
to eat here again, understand?

185
00:13:53,942 --> 00:13:57,877
Give me some sign you understand,
or leave now.

186
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,444
Do you understand me,
you crazy fuck?

187
00:14:10,126 --> 00:14:11,218
Do you?

188
00:14:19,937 --> 00:14:22,030
Yes.

189
00:14:23,474 --> 00:14:25,407
- Yeah?
- Yes.

190
00:14:28,813 --> 00:14:29,904
I'll get your order.

191
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,416
Wear my earrings tonight.

192
00:14:39,056 --> 00:14:41,581
It's just so interesting
what you said at dinner.

193
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:43,990
You said it
like it was nothing.

194
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:52,036
Where's the bedroom?

195
00:14:52,104 --> 00:14:56,768
This is sort of it.
I sort of sleep in here.

196
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:09,120
Don't worry about it.

197
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,913
What?

198
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:38,316
I don't know.

199
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:47,957
Grandma.

200
00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:52,590
Maybe you'd better check.

201
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:54,600
What did you think
I was gonna do?

202
00:15:57,505 --> 00:16:00,634
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Mama!

203
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,643
I was hearing everything
that you were doing...

204
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:07,112
so I put these on
to give you privacy.

205
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:10,845
- So how was dinner?
- Hey, pal.

206
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,648
- How's your friend?
- Are you okay?

207
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,689
- Not bad.
- You got a temperature?

208
00:16:15,757 --> 00:16:17,850
Scootch over.

209
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:21,986
- Where did your friend take you to eat?
- A nice place.

210
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,494
I have him.

211
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:30,002
- One more spit?
- I said I have him. He's waiting.

212
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,734
- Go.
- She has me.

213
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:35,140
- Okay, pal. Give me a hug.
- Carol.

214
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:38,611
- Give me a big hug.
- Carol, I have him.

215
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:41,707
I'm okay, Mom.
She has me. Go.

216
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,357
Close the curtains.

217
00:16:53,197 --> 00:16:56,165
No, you can't smoke!
He can't take smoke!

218
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,369
- Magic.
- Oh.

219
00:17:09,714 --> 00:17:12,409
Oh, God.
Well, that'll teach you.

220
00:17:12,484 --> 00:17:15,384
I don't even notice it anymore.

221
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:18,115
All right. Come here.

222
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:31,702
You don't have to get that embarrassed.
It's a little bit of throw up.

223
00:17:31,771 --> 00:17:33,931
Little bit of throw up.

224
00:17:35,574 --> 00:17:39,032
Well, what shall we do?

225
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:42,274
Want me to write which trains you take
to get home, or you wanna lay down...

226
00:17:42,348 --> 00:17:45,181
No, no.
I'll take a cab.

227
00:17:52,526 --> 00:17:55,359
It's just a little too much reality
for a Friday night.

228
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:04,100
I just can't. I promised Simon
I'd find him a model.

229
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:08,131
Carl, take me off the speaker,
Did I tell you these are house seats?

230
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,574
you could use a break,

231
00:18:10,645 --> 00:18:13,205
Hello, Carl?

232
00:18:13,281 --> 00:18:15,214
you there?

233
00:18:16,718 --> 00:18:19,447
Okay. I just found a model.

234
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:25,256
- Hey, boys!
- I know this guy. He bought me dinner.

235
00:18:25,326 --> 00:18:27,259
Carl, right?

236
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:31,324
Hey, what's going on?

237
00:18:33,936 --> 00:18:36,427
- Remember?
- I only need one.

238
00:18:36,472 --> 00:18:40,237
You picked me up maybe a few weeks,
I don't know, some time ago.

239
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:42,504
This is for a portrait.
I need a pretty face.

240
00:18:43,712 --> 00:18:45,441
Portrait?

241
00:18:45,514 --> 00:18:49,348
I'll give you the address.
It's for tomorrow morning.

242
00:18:49,418 --> 00:18:52,113
Brad Pitt. It's the shit.

243
00:18:52,187 --> 00:18:53,745
- I don't get it.
- Do you read?

244
00:18:58,328 --> 00:19:00,261
Who is it, baby?

245
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,134
Who is that, Verdell?

246
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:12,634
I'm sorry.
I told you today.

247
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:15,974
I was in the studio doing work,
and I just...

248
00:19:17,148 --> 00:19:19,206
It's out here.

249
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,650
- Sure have great things.
- Gershwin is great, isn't he?

250
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,915
I usually make a big deal
about picking models...

251
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:26,979
but Carl is so thorough.

252
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:29,855
I bet he drove you nuts
checking your resume, huh?

253
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,123
This is not a nude.

254
00:19:38,703 --> 00:19:41,900
just kidding around.

255
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:44,236
So much for love.

256
00:19:45,911 --> 00:19:47,309
Yet another pose.

257
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:50,348
Exactly what is
your previous experience?

258
00:19:50,415 --> 00:19:54,716
How about that, hmm?
I'm running out of ideas here.

259
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:58,981
Then give me some direction.

260
00:19:59,057 --> 00:20:00,922
Nothing.

261
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:04,257
I just watch until something
strikes me.

262
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:07,321
I mean, do anything
that you think of.

263
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,769
Wait for me to say "hold that pose,"
then try to comfortably hold it.

264
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:17,074
No direction.

265
00:20:18,311 --> 00:20:19,744
Okay.

266
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:23,179
What I do is watch.

267
00:20:24,485 --> 00:20:27,453
You ever watch somebody
who doesn't know you're watching them?

268
00:20:27,521 --> 00:20:30,752
An old woman
sitting on a bus...

269
00:20:30,825 --> 00:20:32,951
or kids going to school...

270
00:20:33,026 --> 00:20:34,959
or somebody just waiting.

271
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:38,657
And you see this flash
come over them...

272
00:20:38,732 --> 00:20:42,863
and you know immediately that it has
nothing to do with anything external...

273
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:44,427
because that hasn't changed.

274
00:20:44,472 --> 00:20:47,338
And when you see it,
they're sort of realer...

275
00:20:47,408 --> 00:20:49,568
and they're more alive.

276
00:20:50,478 --> 00:20:54,072
If you look at somebody long enough,
you discover their humanity.

277
00:20:56,651 --> 00:20:58,084
Wow.

278
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:02,651
I know exactly what you mean.

279
00:21:07,229 --> 00:21:10,288
Oh, my God.
Hold it.

280
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:17,500
- Hey, look out!
- Excuse me.

281
00:21:19,709 --> 00:21:23,644
- Sorry.
- I got on the third line of dialogue,

282
00:21:23,713 --> 00:21:28,013
I blanked. I had no clue
as to what the next line was.

283
00:21:28,084 --> 00:21:31,451
- Ignores me.
- He said to me, "Last chance."

284
00:21:31,521 --> 00:21:33,546
- Last chance.
- Oh, God.

285
00:21:33,623 --> 00:21:35,021
I came back in.

286
00:21:35,091 --> 00:21:36,955
Here she comes
to ignore me again.

287
00:21:37,027 --> 00:21:39,825
I messed up
on the exact same line.

288
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:42,421
- Guess what.
- What?

289
00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:44,433
He cast me!

290
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:46,867
just what the world needs...
another actress.

291
00:21:46,937 --> 00:21:49,030
Okay, okay.

292
00:21:56,113 --> 00:21:59,014
Can't live without me, huh?

293
00:22:01,018 --> 00:22:02,882
I'm finally gonna ask.

294
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:07,015
What's with the plastic
picnic ware?

295
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,287
Why don't you try ours?
You're afraid it isn't clean?

296
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,728
- You okay?
- I see the help. It's a judgment call.

297
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,266
So give yourself
a little pep talk.

298
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,826
Must try other people's
clean silverware...

299
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:21,396
as part of fun
of dining out.

300
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,974
What's wrong with your son?

301
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,535
Yeah. What do you care?

302
00:22:37,257 --> 00:22:41,022
He's got to fight to breathe.
His asthma can shoot off the charts.

303
00:22:41,094 --> 00:22:42,823
He's allergic to dust.

304
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:46,489
This is New York, so his immune system
bails on him whenever there's trouble.

305
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:50,059
So an ear infection...
Is this bothering you?

306
00:22:54,408 --> 00:22:58,104
An ear infection, whatever, sends us to
the emergency room six times a month...

307
00:22:58,178 --> 00:23:02,580
where I get whatever nine-year-old
they just made a doctor.

308
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,709
Nice chatting with you.

309
00:23:06,754 --> 00:23:09,120
- His name?
- Spencer.

310
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,217
Okay.

311
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:16,555
Spence.

312
00:23:21,771 --> 00:23:21,903
It's okay. Go on. Come on.

313
00:23:21,903 --> 00:23:25,963
It's okay. Go on. Come on.

314
00:23:35,284 --> 00:23:38,845
You can put on anything you want now.
I might be sort of done here.

315
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:41,947
For two weeks all we've done is work.
Let's play!

316
00:23:45,227 --> 00:23:46,660
Vincent!

317
00:23:57,007 --> 00:23:59,804
So you're practically finished, huh?

318
00:24:01,211 --> 00:24:04,112
Yeah.
There is one more stage.

319
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,015
Where you going?

320
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,148
No place.
I was just gonna sneak a peek.

321
00:24:27,672 --> 00:24:30,163
- You want some chocolate?
- No, he's not allowed.

322
00:24:30,241 --> 00:24:32,538
Wait.

323
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,875
I gotta take off.
You want to say good-bye or anything?

324
00:24:35,948 --> 00:24:39,576
- He's just gotta go. One second.
- No, wait.

325
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,017
I'm gonna look
at the painting.

326
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:48,458
Where are you going, sweetheart?

327
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:54,756
You want some water?
What is the matter with you?

328
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:57,028
You want some water?

329
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,069
Simon, wait!

330
00:25:15,622 --> 00:25:16,884
Why are you doing this?

331
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,519
No. No, wait.

332
00:25:21,594 --> 00:25:23,085
See.

333
00:25:23,164 --> 00:25:25,393
- That painting in there...
- What, are you cruising him?

334
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,535
Excuse me.

335
00:25:37,612 --> 00:25:40,445
- Help me!
- We gotta go.

336
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,378
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on!

337
00:25:56,832 --> 00:25:59,800
So you call 9-1 -1
and don't leave your name?

338
00:25:59,868 --> 00:26:01,130
That's right.

339
00:26:01,204 --> 00:26:03,866
Even a dumb geezer should know
Emergency automatically...

340
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,100
- No one got killed.
- Oh, is he dead?

341
00:26:06,174 --> 00:26:07,607
Ask him.

342
00:26:07,677 --> 00:26:09,042
What's wrong with you?

343
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:11,908
Don't bark at me.
I didn't name ya.

344
00:26:11,981 --> 00:26:17,078
We will. If we can't, we'll come back
and ask you again and again.

345
00:26:17,153 --> 00:26:20,247
What, you're trying to
intimidate me with that attitude?

346
00:26:20,323 --> 00:26:24,157
I come from hell. My grandmother's
got more attitude than you.

347
00:26:24,228 --> 00:26:27,891
Go shake down a 7-Eleven
for a day-old wiener.

348
00:26:27,965 --> 00:26:31,491
It's just a matter of time, sir.
There's a painting of one of the guys.

349
00:26:31,568 --> 00:26:33,501
Get some tape on it.

350
00:26:35,305 --> 00:26:38,273
I've been praying for him
since I heard.

351
00:26:38,342 --> 00:26:40,639
So, anyway, I'm on my way
to the hospital.

352
00:26:40,711 --> 00:26:43,304
If you could just
watch the dog tonight.

353
00:26:45,617 --> 00:26:49,417
- I'm sorry. No.
- Okay. Thanks.

354
00:26:49,487 --> 00:26:51,454
Old bitch.

355
00:26:51,523 --> 00:26:53,456
Damn dog.

356
00:26:57,061 --> 00:27:00,326
You're taking him.
Yes, you are!

357
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:02,662
Get the hell out of the way!

358
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:05,931
You're taking him.
This will even the books. One night.

359
00:27:06,772 --> 00:27:09,137
Wait, wait.

360
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:13,007
Do you want to say no to me?

361
00:27:13,078 --> 00:27:14,511
Huh?

362
00:27:18,017 --> 00:27:20,451
I don't want to say nothing
to you.

363
00:27:22,187 --> 00:27:25,554
Because I've never felt as crazy
as I do right now.

364
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,785
I almost want you to say no.

365
00:27:32,131 --> 00:27:34,326
Thanks for looking after him.

366
00:27:34,401 --> 00:27:37,234
Hey! Where are you going?

367
00:27:37,304 --> 00:27:41,400
- You can't do this.
- You don't wanna mess with me today!

368
00:27:41,474 --> 00:27:45,409
I can't take a dog.
Nobody's ever been in here before.

369
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:50,143
Hey, Frank.

370
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:40,126
You're dead.

371
00:28:41,838 --> 00:28:46,207
We don't have no dog food here.
We don't want no dog food here.

372
00:28:46,275 --> 00:28:49,038
You'll eat what we got,
what we eat.

373
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:54,249
All right.

374
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,255
Don't do anything.

375
00:29:17,142 --> 00:29:19,075
Where's the trust?

376
00:29:29,054 --> 00:29:31,079
Never a break.

377
00:29:31,157 --> 00:29:33,351
Dogs.

378
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:46,435
Always look at the bright side
of your life

379
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:54,710
Always look at the lighter side
of your life

380
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:06,289
God.

381
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:06,493
We're not going to sell anything if they
find out we're halfway through a show...

382
00:30:06,493 --> 00:30:09,326
We're not going to sell anything if they
find out we're halfway through a show...

383
00:30:09,396 --> 00:30:11,522
and we haven't sold
a single painting.

384
00:30:11,598 --> 00:30:13,656
We can't reduce the price
at this stage.

385
00:30:13,735 --> 00:30:16,328
What...
I'm in a free fall here.

386
00:30:16,404 --> 00:30:18,200
- Yes?
- We can see him.

387
00:30:18,271 --> 00:30:21,172
Okay. I'll meet you in there.

388
00:30:21,242 --> 00:30:23,733
I will meet you in there.

389
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,743
Okay? One minute.

390
00:30:26,881 --> 00:30:28,712
Thank you.
No, I'm here.

391
00:30:31,285 --> 00:30:33,048
How are you doing, great one?

392
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:35,351
I haven't looked at myself yet.

393
00:30:35,423 --> 00:30:37,720
I figured I could tell
from your reaction.

394
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:39,589
Oh, God.

395
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,726
That bad, huh?

396
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:46,226
I talked to the doctor,
and... Oh!

397
00:30:49,238 --> 00:30:51,364
Okay. It's not that bad.

398
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,772
The doctors say you're gonna be
your old self in a couple of weeks.

399
00:30:54,843 --> 00:30:56,435
The scars might take...

400
00:30:56,513 --> 00:30:59,106
Oh, shit!

401
00:31:05,854 --> 00:31:07,879
-Jackie.
- Yes?

402
00:31:07,956 --> 00:31:10,049
Can you hand me a mirror,
please?

403
00:31:18,702 --> 00:31:21,535
Wait.
I have a smaller one.

404
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:36,042
So how are things anyway?

405
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,747
How's Verdell?

406
00:31:37,822 --> 00:31:40,255
Your neighbor, Mr. Udall.

407
00:31:40,324 --> 00:31:42,417
Taking care of him.

408
00:31:42,493 --> 00:31:44,825
How could you do that?

409
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,863
- No, Simon.
- He'll hurt him.

410
00:31:46,932 --> 00:31:49,765
I promise. Not a chance.

411
00:31:49,835 --> 00:31:52,668
I own this guy.
Besides, there was nobody else.

412
00:31:52,737 --> 00:31:54,601
I'm always on the move.

413
00:31:55,908 --> 00:31:57,841
Trust me.

414
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:01,672
You are very certain my dog is okay,
because you have no idea...

415
00:32:01,747 --> 00:32:03,737
Your dog is fine, Simon.

416
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:07,484
Okay.

417
00:32:10,523 --> 00:32:12,456
Waiting gives the devil time.

418
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,343
Oh, my.

419
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,023
Where did I go?

420
00:32:46,193 --> 00:32:48,457
- Look how friendly he is.
- That's your dog?

421
00:32:51,198 --> 00:32:54,497
What are you doing
with a dog?

422
00:32:54,568 --> 00:32:57,435
Suckered in, set up,
pushed around.

423
00:32:57,505 --> 00:33:00,473
You're not worried
someone might take it?

424
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:05,737
No, not until now,
for Christ's sake.

425
00:33:05,813 --> 00:33:08,247
- Sorry.
- I'm gonna sit here.

426
00:33:09,985 --> 00:33:11,543
Hey, puppy.

427
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,712
He's cute.

428
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:16,757
I love his little face.
It's so cute.

429
00:33:16,825 --> 00:33:18,416
I wonder what breed he is.

430
00:33:23,265 --> 00:33:25,698
He's a little dog.

431
00:33:25,768 --> 00:33:28,896
Next time, if Bryan's not here,
you can bring him in.

432
00:33:30,973 --> 00:33:33,669
How old are you?

433
00:33:33,743 --> 00:33:36,267
If I guessed by your eyes,
I'd say you were 50.

434
00:33:37,613 --> 00:33:39,740
If I went by your eyes,
I'd say you were kind.

435
00:33:39,816 --> 00:33:43,717
So much for eyes.
How old are you?

436
00:33:43,787 --> 00:33:45,549
You brought it up.

437
00:33:45,622 --> 00:33:48,285
- No, I'm curious.
- Not that you're ugly.

438
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,759
Yeah. Easy, pal.
I can take the compliment.

439
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:55,525
But my knees knock when you
turn on the charm full blast.

440
00:33:56,734 --> 00:34:00,294
But I mean,
what's with the dark?

441
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,935
Dawn patrol.

442
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:08,969
Major dawn patrol.
My son had a full-blown attack.

443
00:34:09,046 --> 00:34:13,415
This time, for extra fun,
they gave us the wrong antibiotics.

444
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:16,215
- So I get him home...
- No, no!

445
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,818
The dog.
The bacon's for the dog.

446
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:27,796
Last week I was playing the piano
for him, and he likes it.

447
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:31,801
So I decided I'm gonna...

448
00:34:31,871 --> 00:34:33,236
make a joke.

449
00:34:33,306 --> 00:34:34,829
So you're all set here.

450
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,339
Yeah.

451
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:46,346
I think it's a beautiful day
for our walk today.

452
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:48,352
Very nice.

453
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:03,196
Look at that. Look at him.

454
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,032
I gotta give you something.

455
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:08,632
I gotta give you something
real good too.

456
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:12,668
I'm gonna show it to you.
Come on, buddy.

457
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:16,848
Don't you be like me.

458
00:35:16,918 --> 00:35:19,944
You stay just the way you are,
because you are a perfect man...

459
00:35:20,021 --> 00:35:22,819
and I'm gonna take you home
and get you something to eat.

460
00:35:22,891 --> 00:35:27,089
- What you love. Hear me?
- I'd like to be treated like that.

461
00:35:27,162 --> 00:35:31,495
I'm gonna take you home right now
and get you something. Yes.

462
00:35:31,566 --> 00:35:33,726
Let's go home
and do some writing.

463
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:37,061
He had made the girl happy...

464
00:35:37,138 --> 00:35:40,301
and what a girl.

465
00:35:40,376 --> 00:35:43,242
"You saved my life," she said.

466
00:35:45,014 --> 00:35:47,982
"You'd better make it up to me."

467
00:35:51,253 --> 00:35:52,686
Done.

468
00:35:54,223 --> 00:35:57,420
Yes, I hate the doggie.

469
00:35:57,493 --> 00:35:59,927
Ooh, 62 books.

470
00:35:59,995 --> 00:36:02,190
Done.

471
00:36:02,264 --> 00:36:02,398
We have to cut back expenses
every place we can.

472
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:04,890
We have to cut back expenses
every place we can.

473
00:36:04,935 --> 00:36:08,199
- He has no medical insurance?
- No.

474
00:36:08,271 --> 00:36:12,935
These are the food receipts here,
the household expenses.

475
00:36:13,009 --> 00:36:14,943
Here's one for the dog again.

476
00:36:15,011 --> 00:36:17,605
- I can read it. I got it.
- There you go.

477
00:36:17,681 --> 00:36:20,547
- All the laundry and cleaners.
- Okay, good.

478
00:36:22,753 --> 00:36:24,777
Boy, look at that, huh?

479
00:36:24,856 --> 00:36:28,951
Oh, he likes it
at Chez Melvin, hmm?

480
00:36:30,895 --> 00:36:33,557
What are you coming over here for?
I told you to sit here.

481
00:36:33,631 --> 00:36:38,033
I can't cook with a dog near me.
Okay,just sit. Good.

482
00:36:38,102 --> 00:36:41,094
We don't want any company.
I'll read you some Ralph Waldo Emerson.

483
00:36:41,172 --> 00:36:43,105
Okay, have it your way.

484
00:36:53,452 --> 00:36:54,942
How's Verdell doing?

485
00:36:56,322 --> 00:36:59,484
You know,
he's a pain in the ass.

486
00:37:00,826 --> 00:37:02,259
Well.

487
00:37:03,363 --> 00:37:04,455
Simon's home.

488
00:37:05,532 --> 00:37:08,295
I was hoping you can keep the dog
until he's had a chance...

489
00:37:08,368 --> 00:37:09,959
to think and adjust.

490
00:37:10,035 --> 00:37:14,131
Oh, it's been weeks and weeks.
A few more won't matter.

491
00:37:14,207 --> 00:37:16,333
No, he definitely
wants him back right away.

492
00:37:17,477 --> 00:37:19,410
He'll be by tomorrow.

493
00:37:22,183 --> 00:37:23,308
Okay.

494
00:37:23,383 --> 00:37:25,316
Okay by me.

495
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:34,188
Hungry.
I'll be right with you, pooch.

496
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:43,130
One, two, three, four, five.

497
00:37:51,213 --> 00:37:52,975
I'm okay.

498
00:38:38,295 --> 00:38:40,229
Mr. Udall.

499
00:38:47,404 --> 00:38:50,168
Some face they left hanging on you.
You look like...

500
00:38:50,241 --> 00:38:52,436
Could you take it...

501
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:55,001
just...

502
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:57,570
a little easy, Mr. Udall?

503
00:39:01,452 --> 00:39:03,681
Thank you.

504
00:39:09,494 --> 00:39:12,122
Come here, my beautiful boy.

505
00:39:12,197 --> 00:39:14,222
Come here, boy.

506
00:39:14,299 --> 00:39:16,460
Let's go home and get well.

507
00:39:18,037 --> 00:39:20,904
You can't blame him
for being weird.

508
00:39:21,706 --> 00:39:25,199
Have a look at yourself
in the mirror.

509
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,971
Thank you.

510
00:39:33,852 --> 00:39:35,785
Come on, sweetheart.

511
00:39:38,424 --> 00:39:40,790
Come here, boy.

512
00:39:42,529 --> 00:39:45,498
I know what you want.

513
00:39:49,703 --> 00:39:51,636
Where's my boy?

514
00:39:57,878 --> 00:39:59,811
Don't force him.

515
00:40:32,214 --> 00:40:34,148
Over a dog.

516
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,884
Over an ugly dog.

517
00:40:48,431 --> 00:40:50,762
Worst sidewalk in New York.

518
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:52,766
Look where they put it.

519
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:01,375
Help!

520
00:41:01,445 --> 00:41:04,880
If you want to see me,
you will make an appointment.

521
00:41:04,947 --> 00:41:08,882
Dr. Green, how can you diagnose someone
as an obsessive-compulsive disorder...

522
00:41:08,952 --> 00:41:11,921
and then act as though I had
some choice about barging in?

523
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:14,218
There's not going to be a debate.
You must leave.

524
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:18,226
You said you could help me.
What was that, a tease?

525
00:41:18,295 --> 00:41:21,196
I can help you
if you take responsibility...

526
00:41:21,266 --> 00:41:23,757
- to keep regular appointments.
- You changed the room around.

527
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:26,736
Two years ago.
I also regrew my beard.

528
00:41:26,805 --> 00:41:29,398
But you're not interested
in changes in me.

529
00:41:29,474 --> 00:41:33,501
I don't have this mountain of time.
I have to get to my restaurant.

530
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:37,070
Do you know how hard it was
for me to come here?

531
00:41:37,148 --> 00:41:39,274
- Yes.
- Thank you.

532
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:42,251
No, we're not doing this now.

533
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:47,257
I changed just one pattern,
as you always said I should.

534
00:41:59,105 --> 00:42:01,800
What if this is
as good as it gets?

535
00:42:15,622 --> 00:42:17,817
What the heck are those for?

536
00:42:20,727 --> 00:42:23,287
No. Get Carol.

537
00:42:23,363 --> 00:42:25,092
I'm filling in.

538
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:27,099
We don't know
if she's coming back.

539
00:42:27,168 --> 00:42:30,160
She might be getting a job
closer to home.

540
00:42:32,473 --> 00:42:35,407
- Why plastic?
- What are you trying to do to me?

541
00:42:36,811 --> 00:42:39,302
What the heck do you mean?

542
00:42:39,347 --> 00:42:40,938
Look, elephant girl...

543
00:42:41,015 --> 00:42:44,041
just go get Carol or something.

544
00:42:44,118 --> 00:42:46,780
just have her do
my one meal here.

545
00:42:46,854 --> 00:42:49,118
I'll pay whatever you want.
I'll wait.

546
00:42:52,661 --> 00:42:54,288
Do it!

547
00:42:57,232 --> 00:42:59,928
- Bryan, code blue.
- What happened?

548
00:43:05,909 --> 00:43:08,706
Out!
just shut up and get out!

549
00:43:08,777 --> 00:43:11,074
Do it!

550
00:43:11,146 --> 00:43:13,478
I'll be quiet.

551
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,983
just let me stay here.

552
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:18,612
No problem.
Go get Carol.

553
00:43:20,189 --> 00:43:21,815
Get her here.

554
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:25,726
I'm not a prick.
You are. I'm not judging.

555
00:43:25,795 --> 00:43:27,956
I'm a great customer.

556
00:43:28,031 --> 00:43:29,225
This day...

557
00:43:30,133 --> 00:43:32,066
has been a disaster.

558
00:43:33,571 --> 00:43:37,405
- I'm not sure if I can handle this too.
- Get out.

559
00:43:38,442 --> 00:43:39,875
Get out immediately...

560
00:43:39,944 --> 00:43:42,343
or there's gonna be trouble.

561
00:43:42,413 --> 00:43:44,346
Man, I mean it.

562
00:43:53,024 --> 00:43:54,888
Okay.

563
00:43:59,798 --> 00:44:01,731
See ya. Good-bye.

564
00:44:02,801 --> 00:44:04,563
It's about time!

565
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:08,371
Carol's last name.

566
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:13,038
- Connelly.
- Thank you.

567
00:44:14,279 --> 00:44:16,770
Hey, Dad, I'm over here!

568
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:23,181
- Does he visit often?
- Not really. Not anymore.

569
00:44:23,255 --> 00:44:24,551
What can you do?

570
00:44:33,032 --> 00:44:35,125
Can I get some ice cream, Grandpa?

571
00:44:35,201 --> 00:44:37,362
Why not? You're a good girl.

572
00:44:37,437 --> 00:44:38,869
Hello.

573
00:44:54,555 --> 00:44:55,647
Christ.

574
00:45:14,976 --> 00:45:16,102
I'm hungry.

575
00:45:17,913 --> 00:45:20,779
You've ruined my whole day.
I haven't eaten.

576
00:45:20,849 --> 00:45:22,476
What are you doing here?

577
00:45:22,551 --> 00:45:25,610
This is not a sexist thing.
If you were a waiter...

578
00:45:25,688 --> 00:45:28,589
Are you totally gone?
This is my private home.

579
00:45:31,194 --> 00:45:34,424
I'm trying to keep emotion
out of this...

580
00:45:34,496 --> 00:45:36,987
even though it's
an important issue to me...

581
00:45:37,066 --> 00:45:40,365
and I have very strong feelings
on the subject.

582
00:45:40,436 --> 00:45:42,198
What subject?

583
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,967
That I wasn't there to take crap
from you and bring you eggs?

584
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:48,271
Do you have any control over how
creepy you allow yourself to get?

585
00:45:54,018 --> 00:45:57,214
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.

586
00:45:58,656 --> 00:46:00,680
And to prove it...

587
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,351
I have not gotten personal,
and you have.

588
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:07,390
Why aren't you at work?

589
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:09,057
You sick?

590
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:13,669
You don't look sick.

591
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,539
just tired and bitter.

592
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,404
My son is sick, okay?

593
00:46:26,952 --> 00:46:29,010
What about your mother?

594
00:46:30,322 --> 00:46:31,812
How do you know
about my mother?

595
00:46:33,226 --> 00:46:35,717
I hear you talking
while I wait.

596
00:46:35,761 --> 00:46:39,253
- Mom, I finished my juice.
- I'm sorry, honey. One second.

597
00:46:49,175 --> 00:46:50,267
How're you doing?

598
00:46:57,183 --> 00:46:59,674
You should answer someone
when they speak to you.

599
00:46:59,752 --> 00:47:03,119
Melvin, that's it. I cannot handle
you teaching my son manners!

600
00:47:07,361 --> 00:47:09,294
Back to life.

601
00:47:17,371 --> 00:47:20,204
Uh-oh. What's wrong?

602
00:47:20,275 --> 00:47:23,175
Five one-thousand,
four one-thousand...

603
00:47:23,243 --> 00:47:26,406
three one-thousand,
two one-thousand...

604
00:47:26,481 --> 00:47:27,914
bingo.

605
00:47:29,449 --> 00:47:33,476
- 1 04.9.
- Let's treat ourselves to a cab ride.

606
00:47:35,123 --> 00:47:37,818
Look out, you guys.
Coming through.

607
00:47:41,129 --> 00:47:44,223
- Mom!
- We're okay.

608
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,728
Melvin, wait!

609
00:47:50,139 --> 00:47:51,231
Melvin, wait!

610
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,677
Shut up, kids!

611
00:48:02,051 --> 00:48:03,984
Give us a lift,
would you, Melvin?

612
00:48:04,053 --> 00:48:05,986
A lift. Okay.

613
00:48:08,491 --> 00:48:11,517
Cover your mouth
when you cough, kid.

614
00:48:14,331 --> 00:48:16,855
Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital,
and quickly, please.

615
00:48:16,933 --> 00:48:18,696
Okay.

616
00:48:18,768 --> 00:48:20,462
- Hospital?
- Yes.

617
00:48:20,537 --> 00:48:23,937
- Could you be back at work today?
- No!

618
00:48:24,007 --> 00:48:26,532
Stay away from me!
God!

619
00:48:30,046 --> 00:48:30,213
Simon, we can't
put this off any longer.

620
00:48:30,213 --> 00:48:33,808
Simon, we can't
put this off any longer.

621
00:48:33,885 --> 00:48:36,478
I feel terrible that I have to...

622
00:48:36,554 --> 00:48:38,385
- Simon.
- Huh?

623
00:48:38,456 --> 00:48:41,618
Could you just leave the dog
for a second?

624
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,885
Sorry.

625
00:48:48,866 --> 00:48:51,494
- What are those cards?
- Frank's idea.

626
00:48:51,569 --> 00:48:53,560
He thought I should have notes
so I did this right...

627
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,040
maintained focus, didn't get emotional
and tried not to terrify you.

628
00:48:59,912 --> 00:49:03,473
See? He's right.
I need the cards.

629
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:11,152
Simon, you're broke.

630
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:16,692
The medical bills
are $61 ,000 now...

631
00:49:16,763 --> 00:49:18,663
and the show didn't go well.

632
00:49:18,731 --> 00:49:21,028
I've spoken to your parents.

633
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,762
They didn't hang up
or anything...

634
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:27,168
but they said they would
feel strange about calling you.

635
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:31,506
Well, I can't call them.

636
00:49:31,578 --> 00:49:32,670
Come here, baby.

637
00:49:35,982 --> 00:49:38,916
Verdell. What's wrong?

638
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:44,581
You miss the tough guy?
Well, here I am, sweetheart!

639
00:49:44,658 --> 00:49:46,921
Happy to see me,
you little pissant mop?

640
00:49:46,994 --> 00:49:49,861
How about another ride
down the chute?

641
00:49:49,931 --> 00:49:52,422
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

642
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,592
- Simon.
- I didn't mean that, sweetheart.

643
00:49:54,669 --> 00:49:56,465
Sorry. I'm sorry.

644
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:01,540
I'll be able to keep
my apartment and the studio...

645
00:50:01,609 --> 00:50:03,542
won't I?

646
00:50:06,982 --> 00:50:09,381
Wow.

647
00:50:09,451 --> 00:50:11,577
Oh, my God.

648
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:44,083
Yes, you write more than everybody else
and make us a lot of money.

649
00:50:44,154 --> 00:50:46,087
- But it's more appropriate...
- Look.

650
00:50:47,257 --> 00:50:50,454
I need this.
just say, "Melvin, I'll try."

651
00:50:50,528 --> 00:50:52,189
Okay?

652
00:50:55,032 --> 00:50:58,991
- Melvin, I'll try.
- Thank you. That's good.

653
00:50:59,069 --> 00:51:04,166
On a pleasanter note, my son
just got accepted to Brown.

654
00:51:04,241 --> 00:51:06,402
My husband was dying.

655
00:51:06,477 --> 00:51:09,969
Yeah. Good, nice,
thrilled, exciting.

656
00:51:10,048 --> 00:51:12,539
You don't have to wait with me.

657
00:51:19,223 --> 00:51:21,123
I can't resist.

658
00:51:21,193 --> 00:51:23,456
You usually move
through here so quickly.

659
00:51:23,528 --> 00:51:26,861
I have so many questions
I want to ask you.

660
00:51:26,932 --> 00:51:30,526
You have no idea
what your work means to me.

661
00:51:30,602 --> 00:51:32,502
What does it mean to you?

662
00:51:34,073 --> 00:51:38,976
That somebody out there knows
what it's like to be in here.

663
00:51:40,046 --> 00:51:42,673
Oh, God.
This is like a nightmare.

664
00:51:42,749 --> 00:51:47,413
just a couple of questions.
How hard is that?

665
00:51:50,656 --> 00:51:52,817
How do you write women so well?

666
00:51:52,892 --> 00:51:55,121
I think of a man...

667
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:58,096
and I take away reason
and accountability.

668
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:16,944
- Where's my newspaper?
- It's right here, Mrs. Garrett.

669
00:52:19,788 --> 00:52:22,187
"M.D."

670
00:52:29,097 --> 00:52:31,155
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

671
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:33,962
- Mom!
- In here, Mrs. Connelly.

672
00:52:34,035 --> 00:52:36,265
What? Please,just tell me.

673
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:40,772
- I'm Martin Bettes. Dr. Bettes.
- Not your name!

674
00:52:40,842 --> 00:52:44,334
- Don't tell me your name! Where is he?
- He's in the bathroom.

675
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,074
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

676
00:52:47,149 --> 00:52:50,050
- Did you know docs come to your house?
- No, I didn't.

677
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:52,882
- I'm home!
- So what are you doing here?

678
00:52:52,955 --> 00:52:55,981
-I didn't know you had a secret admirer.
-What?

679
00:52:56,058 --> 00:52:59,221
- Oh, you met the gift.
- He's good.

680
00:52:59,295 --> 00:53:03,925
- I'm an expert on doctors.
- Okay, Doctor.

681
00:53:05,369 --> 00:53:08,895
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.

682
00:53:08,971 --> 00:53:11,701
She said I was to take excellent care
of this little guy...

683
00:53:11,775 --> 00:53:14,505
because you are urgently needed
back at work.

684
00:53:14,578 --> 00:53:16,671
What kind of work do you do?

685
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:20,409
- I'm a waitress.
- In Manhattan.

686
00:53:23,053 --> 00:53:26,045
Uh, yeah, Terry. Excuse me.

687
00:53:27,125 --> 00:53:30,059
I'm sorry it took so long.
I don't know Brooklyn.

688
00:53:30,128 --> 00:53:32,721
I couldn't find it either.
Could you get this to the lab?

689
00:53:32,797 --> 00:53:36,062
Tell them I need CBC, differential,
platelets, the whole thing.

690
00:53:36,134 --> 00:53:38,465
- And I want it back today.
- Okay.

691
00:53:38,536 --> 00:53:41,470
I'm sorry. Did you say you're gonna
get the results back today?

692
00:53:41,539 --> 00:53:43,472
Sure. Let's sit down.

693
00:53:45,376 --> 00:53:48,903
These are the receipts
from all the prescriptions...

694
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:51,244
from the beginning of the year.

695
00:53:51,317 --> 00:53:55,844
- The calendar.
- And this is a calendar of days...

696
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,582
and how he felt
and what he's been eating.

697
00:53:58,657 --> 00:54:02,218
That's very good.
How long has he had the problem?

698
00:54:02,294 --> 00:54:04,990
Since forever. Six months old.

699
00:54:05,064 --> 00:54:07,897
- Have they done blood tests on him?
- Yeah.

700
00:54:07,968 --> 00:54:10,265
Only in the emergency room
or when he was well?

701
00:54:10,337 --> 00:54:14,272
- Emergency room only.
- How about skin testing for allergies?

702
00:54:14,341 --> 00:54:17,640
- No.
- No standard scratch test?

703
00:54:17,711 --> 00:54:22,875
No. I asked. They said my plan
didn't cover it and it wasn't necessary.

704
00:54:22,949 --> 00:54:25,509
- Why? Should they have?
- Well...

705
00:54:25,585 --> 00:54:28,986
Fucking HMO bastard pieces of shit!

706
00:54:31,024 --> 00:54:34,585
- I'm sorry.
- Actually, that's their technical name.

707
00:54:36,831 --> 00:54:39,128
So, once the tests come back...

708
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,169
is there someone in your office
we should talk to to get the results?

709
00:54:42,236 --> 00:54:46,400
Um, me. My home number's on the card.

710
00:54:47,908 --> 00:54:49,841
That's his home number.

711
00:54:56,118 --> 00:54:59,554
- What?
- It's your home number!

712
00:55:03,292 --> 00:55:07,786
Can we get you anything else?
Do you want some water or some coffee?

713
00:55:07,863 --> 00:55:10,991
- No, thank you.
- A couple of female slaves?

714
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:15,764
Mrs. Connelly, there's still
a lot of tests I need to do...

715
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:17,896
a lot of things
I have to find out here.

716
00:55:17,973 --> 00:55:21,841
But look, whatever I find out,
I promise you, at the very least...

717
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:26,074
from now on your son is going to feel
a great deal better, okay?

718
00:55:34,491 --> 00:55:35,582
Doc!

719
00:55:40,463 --> 00:55:43,432
No. Oh, fine. Okay.

720
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,091
That's good.

721
00:55:51,075 --> 00:55:54,169
So, listen, you gotta let me know
about the additional costs.

722
00:55:54,244 --> 00:55:55,540
One way or another, we'll...

723
00:55:55,612 --> 00:55:58,011
Well, the costs are gonna be
considerable, I'm afraid.

724
00:55:59,784 --> 00:56:03,378
But don't worry.
Mr. Udall wants to be billed.

725
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:09,993
That's wonderful!

726
00:56:13,866 --> 00:56:17,392
Anyway, dear.
Thank you for everything, Nora.

727
00:56:17,469 --> 00:56:22,133
Forgive my recent crankiness.
I'll call when things get back on track.

728
00:56:30,216 --> 00:56:32,116
Huh? What's wrong?

729
00:56:32,184 --> 00:56:35,710
- Who's gonna walk Verdell?
- Oh, no!

730
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:57,541
- Is he dead yet?
- No.

731
00:56:59,814 --> 00:57:03,773
Would there be any way
that you would be willing...

732
00:57:03,851 --> 00:57:05,944
to walk his dog for him?

733
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:07,578
Absolutely.

734
00:57:08,923 --> 00:57:11,152
You're a wonderful man.

735
00:57:14,295 --> 00:57:17,662
2:00 would be a good time,
and here is the key...

736
00:57:17,733 --> 00:57:19,791
in case he is asleep.

737
00:57:21,068 --> 00:57:23,001
Open his curtains for him...

738
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:26,335
so he can see God's beautiful work.

739
00:57:26,408 --> 00:57:30,639
And he'll know that even things
like this happen for the best.

740
00:57:31,814 --> 00:57:36,274
Did they teach you to talk like this
in some "Sailor, wanna hump-hump" bar?

741
00:57:36,351 --> 00:57:39,320
Or is this getaway day
and your last shot at his whiskey?

742
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:43,017
Sell crazy someplace else.
We're all stocked up here.

743
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:58,229
A seriously goofy man is behind this.
You're not allowed to block that out.

744
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:00,640
Do you really want to go
back to Emergency...

745
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:03,804
where those runt doctors
keep telling us that they can't help?

746
00:58:03,881 --> 00:58:07,078
- This lets a crazy man into our lives.
- Let's not fight.

747
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:09,118
You know how this will turn out.
Come on!

748
00:58:12,356 --> 00:58:15,153
You know how this will turn out.

749
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:17,989
This is not like stockings.
It's not like a string of pearls.

750
00:58:18,062 --> 00:58:20,461
You don't send this one back.

751
00:58:24,903 --> 00:58:26,062
Right?

752
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:35,707
No, I do, I understand,

753
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:38,270
Listen, I gotta go, okay?

754
00:58:43,121 --> 00:58:44,554
Bye-bye.

755
00:58:51,696 --> 00:58:54,062
What a day. Come here.

756
00:58:54,133 --> 00:58:57,067
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

757
00:58:57,136 --> 00:58:59,660
Thank you for walking him.

758
00:59:02,174 --> 00:59:04,540
If you'll excuse me,
I'm not feeling so well.

759
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:07,602
This place smells like shit.

760
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,113
Go away.

761
00:59:10,384 --> 00:59:14,012
- This cleaning lady doesn't...
- Please,just leave!

762
00:59:17,324 --> 00:59:19,484
What happened to your queer
party friends?

763
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,117
Get outta here!

764
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:30,529
Nothing worse than having to feel
this way in front of you.

765
00:59:30,604 --> 00:59:34,096
Nellie, you're a disgrace
to depression.

766
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,635
Rot in hell, Melvin.

767
00:59:40,747 --> 00:59:42,681
No need to stop being a lady.

768
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:44,274
Quit worrying.

769
00:59:44,352 --> 00:59:47,378
You'll be back on your knees in no time.

770
00:59:56,231 --> 00:59:57,663
Is this fun for you?

771
01:00:00,134 --> 01:00:03,627
You lucky devil. It just keeps
getting better, doesn't it?

772
01:00:03,706 --> 01:00:06,333
I'm losing my apartment.

773
01:00:06,408 --> 01:00:11,971
And Frank wants me to beg my parents,
who haven't called me, for help.

774
01:00:12,047 --> 01:00:14,015
And I won't.

775
01:00:14,084 --> 01:00:17,451
I don't want to paint anymore.

776
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:21,080
So the life that I was trying for
is over.

777
01:00:21,157 --> 01:00:23,317
The life that I had is gone...

778
01:00:23,393 --> 01:00:27,624
and I'm feeling so damn sorry for myself
that it's difficult to breathe.

779
01:00:27,697 --> 01:00:30,257
It's high times for you, isn't it?

780
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:33,996
The gay neighbor is terrified.

781
01:00:34,071 --> 01:00:35,367
Terrified!

782
01:00:47,818 --> 01:00:50,547
I was just trying to give you a boost.

783
01:00:51,989 --> 01:00:53,923
Lucky you.

784
01:00:53,991 --> 01:00:56,755
You're here for rock bottom...

785
01:00:56,828 --> 01:01:00,763
you absolute horror of a human being.

786
01:01:14,013 --> 01:01:18,244
The one thing I'll do for you...
I might cheer you up.

787
01:01:19,318 --> 01:01:20,808
Get out.

788
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:24,378
You wanna know
why the dog prefers me?

789
01:01:24,456 --> 01:01:27,448
It's not affection.
It's a trick.

790
01:01:30,897 --> 01:01:33,490
I keep bacon in my pocket.

791
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,531
See?

792
01:01:37,336 --> 01:01:38,769
Oh, my gosh.

793
01:01:42,943 --> 01:01:45,877
We'll both call him.
You'll see.

794
01:01:45,946 --> 01:01:47,378
It's a trick.

795
01:01:56,824 --> 01:01:58,257
Come here, Verdell.

796
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,590
Come on.

797
01:02:08,002 --> 01:02:11,334
Come here, baby. It's okay.

798
01:02:17,145 --> 01:02:19,409
just stupid. A stupid dog.

799
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:23,483
Could you leave now?

800
01:02:25,254 --> 01:02:26,686
Please?

801
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:30,223
I don't get it.

802
01:03:24,683 --> 01:03:26,173
Taxi!

803
01:03:58,017 --> 01:04:01,350
Watch again with Nick At Nite's
Classic TVRewind,

804
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:04,083
On repeat viewing,
one begins to suspect...

805
01:04:04,157 --> 01:04:08,252
that might not really be Major Healy
in the phone booth after all,

806
01:04:12,199 --> 01:04:14,565
- Carol the waitress?
- Yes.

807
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:28,227
The doctors gave me your address.
I'm sorry about the hour.

808
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,237
If you're, uh...

809
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,111
If you're worried about thanking me...

810
01:04:45,484 --> 01:04:46,974
That's not why I'm here.

811
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:51,617
Though you have no idea what it's like
to have a real conversation...

812
01:04:51,692 --> 01:04:53,353
with a doctor about Spencer.

813
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:58,558
Note. Put it in a note.

814
01:05:10,247 --> 01:05:11,737
I have a hair dryer...

815
01:05:12,682 --> 01:05:15,116
Why did you do this for me?

816
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:20,655
So you'd come back to work
and wait on me.

817
01:05:21,726 --> 01:05:25,127
Do you have some idea
how strange that sounds?

818
01:05:25,197 --> 01:05:26,630
Well, I mean...

819
01:05:26,699 --> 01:05:29,634
I'm worried you did this be...

820
01:05:45,621 --> 01:05:48,749
Are you waiting for me
to say something?

821
01:05:52,896 --> 01:05:54,328
Look.

822
01:05:57,133 --> 01:05:59,067
I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.

823
01:05:59,135 --> 01:06:02,663
I don't think this can wait.
I need to clear this up now.

824
01:06:03,908 --> 01:06:04,999
Clear what up?

825
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,578
I'm not going to sleep with you.

826
01:06:10,649 --> 01:06:13,515
I will never sleep with you!
Never, ever!

827
01:06:15,088 --> 01:06:16,851
Not ever!

828
01:06:24,064 --> 01:06:25,998
I'm sorry, but...

829
01:06:27,801 --> 01:06:31,568
we don't open for the "no sex" oaths
until 9:00 a.m.

830
01:06:33,542 --> 01:06:34,975
I'm not kidding.

831
01:06:36,711 --> 01:06:38,144
Anything else?

832
01:06:41,884 --> 01:06:43,442
just...

833
01:06:45,821 --> 01:06:47,756
thank you.

834
01:06:51,995 --> 01:06:53,930
So you'll be at work tomorrow?

835
01:06:58,437 --> 01:07:00,029
Yes.

836
01:07:15,056 --> 01:07:17,114
"Never," she says.

837
01:07:36,847 --> 01:07:39,783
I took a chance you were up.

838
01:07:41,186 --> 01:07:43,518
I brought you some Chinese soup.

839
01:07:46,692 --> 01:07:48,284
Thanks.

840
01:08:05,213 --> 01:08:07,978
I've never been this tired
in my life.

841
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:17,759
I haven't been sleeping.

842
01:08:20,631 --> 01:08:23,225
I haven't been clear in my head...

843
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,564
or felt like myself.

844
01:08:28,572 --> 01:08:29,664
I'm in trouble.

845
01:08:31,576 --> 01:08:34,602
It's not just the tiredness.

846
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:38,411
- Boy.
- Sick. Nauseous.

847
01:08:38,484 --> 01:08:40,452
Sleepy.

848
01:08:40,521 --> 01:08:42,681
Where everything looks distorted...

849
01:08:42,756 --> 01:08:44,883
and everything inside you...

850
01:08:44,958 --> 01:08:49,327
kind of aches and you can barely find
the will to complain.

851
01:08:49,396 --> 01:08:51,159
Yeah.

852
01:08:54,869 --> 01:08:57,770
I'm glad we did this.

853
01:08:59,175 --> 01:09:01,267
Good talking to you.

854
01:09:09,953 --> 01:09:12,387
You are not still writing
that thank-you note.

855
01:09:12,457 --> 01:09:15,051
I'm on the last page.
How do you spell "conscience"?

856
01:09:16,562 --> 01:09:20,157
C-O-N-S-C-I-E-N-C-E.

857
01:09:20,232 --> 01:09:23,793
Look, I got Sean from the bakery
to baby-sit so we could go out.

858
01:09:25,638 --> 01:09:28,129
I still don't feel safe
leaving Spencer with someone.

859
01:09:28,208 --> 01:09:31,301
- Could you spell it again, please?
- Spencer's okay.

860
01:09:31,378 --> 01:09:34,745
You better start finding something else
to do with your free time.

861
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:38,578
- Sean, are you hungry?
- Yes.

862
01:09:38,653 --> 01:09:41,086
All right. We got pizza.

863
01:09:41,156 --> 01:09:44,319
Carol and I are going out.
Sausage and pepperoni.

864
01:09:44,393 --> 01:09:46,622
You want to make this later
for you and Spencer?

865
01:09:48,364 --> 01:09:51,356
We are going out, like people do.

866
01:09:53,937 --> 01:09:57,201
If you can't feel good
about this break...

867
01:09:57,274 --> 01:10:00,437
and step out a little...

868
01:10:00,512 --> 01:10:03,310
then I think you
ought to have Mr. Udall...

869
01:10:03,381 --> 01:10:05,542
send you over a psychiatrist.

870
01:10:05,617 --> 01:10:09,519
I don't need one, because I know
what's really going on here!

871
01:10:11,858 --> 01:10:14,418
I gotta finish this letter
or I'll go nuts.

872
01:10:14,494 --> 01:10:17,088
This can't be right.
"Con-science?"

873
01:10:24,972 --> 01:10:26,064
What?

874
01:10:42,993 --> 01:10:46,759
It's very weird now
not feeling that...

875
01:10:46,831 --> 01:10:49,732
stupid panic thing
inside me all the time.

876
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:55,032
Without that, I just
start thinking about myself.

877
01:10:55,106 --> 01:10:58,041
And what good does that
ever get anybody?

878
01:11:01,948 --> 01:11:05,476
Today on the bus
there was this adorable couple...

879
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:07,520
and I felt myself...

880
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:10,888
giving them a dirty look.

881
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:18,298
I just had no idea everything was...

882
01:11:27,043 --> 01:11:28,635
Go ahead.

883
01:11:30,881 --> 01:11:33,817
Moving in the wrong direction.

884
01:11:34,887 --> 01:11:37,047
Away from a time...

885
01:11:37,121 --> 01:11:41,080
when I remembered what it was like
to have a man to anything.

886
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:43,889
Hold fucking...

887
01:11:44,963 --> 01:11:47,158
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

888
01:11:47,233 --> 01:11:50,566
Hands with, for Christ's sake!

889
01:11:53,706 --> 01:11:57,506
I felt almost really bad...

890
01:11:57,578 --> 01:11:59,136
that Dr. Bettes is married.

891
01:12:03,351 --> 01:12:07,288
Which is probably why I make Spencer
hug me more than he wants to.

892
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:12,360
Poor kid doesn't have enough problems.

893
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:15,363
He has to make up
for his mom not getting any.

894
01:12:19,603 --> 01:12:21,537
Who needs these thoughts?

895
01:12:22,473 --> 01:12:25,533
So what are you saying?
That you're frustrated?

896
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:28,238
Leave me be!
Why are you doing this?

897
01:12:28,314 --> 01:12:30,805
What is it you want?

898
01:12:30,849 --> 01:12:33,009
I hope getting me to think about
everything that's wrong...

899
01:12:33,085 --> 01:12:35,053
when all I want to do
is not do that...

900
01:12:35,121 --> 01:12:37,055
has some purpose.

901
01:12:38,725 --> 01:12:43,162
Really, Mom, what is it you want?
What?

902
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:45,561
I want us to go out.

903
01:12:53,943 --> 01:12:56,206
Okay.

904
01:13:16,502 --> 01:13:17,992
Thank you.

905
01:13:18,037 --> 01:13:20,300
Now I gotta send you
a thank-you note.

906
01:13:21,508 --> 01:13:25,069
Oh, look. Evelyn's here
and her giant,Joey.

907
01:13:28,416 --> 01:13:28,548
That's really
why you brought me here?

908
01:13:28,548 --> 01:13:30,846
That's really
why you brought me here?

909
01:13:30,918 --> 01:13:33,648
Well, you know,
it's not even mine.

910
01:13:33,721 --> 01:13:36,781
And this guy Simon seems
to have enough on his mind.

911
01:13:36,859 --> 01:13:40,989
But the dog did throw up
twice last night and his spark is off.

912
01:13:41,064 --> 01:13:43,999
- Well, take him to the vet.
- I did.

913
01:13:44,067 --> 01:13:48,299
They say his stomach's out of whack
and they need him for a couple of days.

914
01:13:48,371 --> 01:13:49,929
Well, do it!

915
01:13:51,142 --> 01:13:53,804
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

916
01:13:55,179 --> 01:13:58,170
- This is for later.
- What's this?

917
01:13:59,451 --> 01:14:01,942
- It's a note.
- A note?

918
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:04,750
Yeah, it's a thank-you note.

919
01:14:04,824 --> 01:14:06,951
Thank-you note? No, no.

920
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:09,551
- You can read it later.
- No, thank you.

921
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:11,359
No thank-you note.

922
01:14:14,568 --> 01:14:16,365
Thank you.

923
01:14:23,244 --> 01:14:24,336
She's nice.

924
01:14:26,247 --> 01:14:28,272
- Yeah.
- Real nice, huh?

925
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:30,284
Really nice.

926
01:14:32,456 --> 01:14:37,450
Shouldn't that be a good thing,
telling somebody, "No thanks required"?

927
01:14:38,862 --> 01:14:41,558
Sure looks like it went over too.

928
01:14:44,369 --> 01:14:46,303
Look at you!

929
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:52,268
You're sure making the rounds.
Simon says you brought him soup.

930
01:14:57,650 --> 01:14:59,617
- What?
- Look at you.

931
01:14:59,686 --> 01:15:03,384
- You think I'm a mark.
- You helped with the dog and now this.

932
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:06,323
Hey, I'm as concerned
about Simon as you are.

933
01:15:06,394 --> 01:15:09,488
- Concerned?
- It's not just financial assistance.

934
01:15:09,564 --> 01:15:12,692
He's gotta get to Baltimore
to ask his parents for money tomorrow.

935
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:16,430
Well, yeah. I mean,
if his parents are alive.

936
01:15:16,506 --> 01:15:18,474
They have to help.
It's the rules.

937
01:15:18,541 --> 01:15:21,635
That's great.
Let them help him.

938
01:15:23,981 --> 01:15:26,245
Only, uh...

939
01:15:26,316 --> 01:15:30,650
I got a high-maintenance selling painter
coming through, so I'm out.

940
01:15:31,723 --> 01:15:33,156
Can you drive him?

941
01:15:35,427 --> 01:15:37,520
Think white and get serious.

942
01:15:39,365 --> 01:15:40,923
Take my car. A convertible.

943
01:15:43,169 --> 01:15:44,898
Do you drive?

944
01:15:44,971 --> 01:15:48,031
Like the wind.
But I'm not doin' it!

945
01:15:48,109 --> 01:15:50,600
Gettin' loud.

946
01:15:52,346 --> 01:15:55,076
He wants me to take his car
and his client to Baltimore.

947
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:57,845
I want your life for one minute,
where my big problem is...

948
01:15:57,919 --> 01:16:01,515
somebody offers me a free convertible
so I can get out of this city.

949
01:16:08,866 --> 01:16:12,529
- Go ahead, girl.
- Okay, I'll do it.

950
01:16:12,603 --> 01:16:14,229
I'll take him.

951
01:16:14,306 --> 01:16:16,364
Yeah, get him ready, packed.

952
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,931
Tomorrow morning I'll take him.

953
01:16:19,010 --> 01:16:21,774
- Fine. Okay.
- Okay.

954
01:16:23,648 --> 01:16:26,549
I'll see you tomorrow.
Let's not drag this out.

955
01:16:26,619 --> 01:16:29,053
We don't enjoy one another that much.

956
01:16:34,394 --> 01:16:37,330
If there is a mental health foundation
that raises money for people like you...

957
01:16:37,397 --> 01:16:39,456
please be sure to let me know.

958
01:16:40,435 --> 01:16:42,299
Last-word freak.

959
01:16:42,370 --> 01:16:45,999
- Good luck, lady.
- Was he talking to me?

960
01:16:46,075 --> 01:16:49,476
- So anything else?
- Yeah.

961
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:54,513
I'm gonna give my queer neighbor
a lift to Baltimore.

962
01:17:00,024 --> 01:17:03,016
What I did for you,
it's working out?

963
01:17:07,532 --> 01:17:09,692
What you did changed my life.

964
01:17:14,606 --> 01:17:17,166
No thank-you note.

965
01:17:17,243 --> 01:17:20,610
Well, part of what I said
in this entire history of my life...

966
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,648
which you won't read...

967
01:17:24,151 --> 01:17:26,279
is that somehow
you have done more...

968
01:17:26,354 --> 01:17:28,652
for my mother, my son...

969
01:17:28,723 --> 01:17:32,055
and me than anybody else ever has.

970
01:17:32,127 --> 01:17:35,290
I'm just gonna read you
this part of it.

971
01:17:37,133 --> 01:17:40,261
"And that makes you
the most important, surprising...

972
01:17:40,336 --> 01:17:42,463
generous person
I ever met in my life...

973
01:17:42,539 --> 01:17:45,439
and that you're gonna be
in our prayers...

974
01:17:45,509 --> 01:17:47,443
our daily prayers forever."

975
01:17:48,913 --> 01:17:50,004
Lovely.

976
01:17:52,517 --> 01:17:55,247
I also wrote one part
I'm just gonna say.

977
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:56,878
I wrote, "I'm sorry."

978
01:17:58,957 --> 01:18:04,088
I was talking about I was sorry
when I got mad at you for...

979
01:18:04,164 --> 01:18:07,429
when you came over and you told my son
that he ought to answer back.

980
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:10,435
So I wrote that I was sorry
about that and that I...

981
01:18:10,504 --> 01:18:14,839
I was sorry for busting you on that
and busting in on you that night...

982
01:18:14,909 --> 01:18:16,342
when I said I was never...

983
01:18:19,181 --> 01:18:22,378
I was sorry, and I'm sorry
for every time your food was cold...

984
01:18:22,451 --> 01:18:25,387
and that you had to wait two seconds
for a coffee filler...

985
01:18:25,454 --> 01:18:28,423
and I'm sorry for never spotting right
there at the table in the restaurant...

986
01:18:28,492 --> 01:18:32,553
the human being that had it in him
to do this thing for us.

987
01:18:34,098 --> 01:18:36,293
You know what?
I'm just gonna start from the beginning.

988
01:18:36,367 --> 01:18:38,733
"I have not been able...

989
01:18:38,803 --> 01:18:41,363
to express my gratefulness to you.

990
01:18:41,439 --> 01:18:43,430
Even as I look
at the word 'grateful' now...

991
01:18:43,509 --> 01:18:45,534
it doesn't begin to tell you
what I feel."

992
01:18:49,882 --> 01:18:54,717
That's nice of you.
Thank you.

993
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:58,323
Thank you.

994
01:19:09,038 --> 01:19:11,096
Now I want you to do something for me.

995
01:19:19,683 --> 01:19:22,277
I'm sorry.
Didn't I say, "What?"

996
01:19:22,353 --> 01:19:24,947
I thought I said "What?"

997
01:19:27,758 --> 01:19:28,850
What?

998
01:19:28,927 --> 01:19:31,293
I want you to go on this trip.

999
01:19:32,265 --> 01:19:33,357
No, sir.

1000
01:19:33,433 --> 01:19:35,423
I can't do this without you.

1001
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:39,698
I'm afraid he might pull
the stiff"one eye" on me.

1002
01:19:39,772 --> 01:19:41,434
I need you to chaperone.

1003
01:19:41,508 --> 01:19:43,999
Separate everything but cars.

1004
01:19:44,077 --> 01:19:46,637
You said you like convertibles.
Now I'm on the hook.

1005
01:19:46,714 --> 01:19:49,205
I'm sorry. The stiff"one eye"?

1006
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:51,309
- Two days.
- I can't. I work.

1007
01:19:51,386 --> 01:19:53,877
- You get off when you want to.
- My son.

1008
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:55,616
Bettes said he's doin' fine.

1009
01:19:57,326 --> 01:19:59,954
- Melvin, I'd rather not.
- What's that got to do with it?

1010
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:04,159
- I thought it was a strong point.
- Write a note, ain't she sweet.

1011
01:20:04,234 --> 01:20:06,635
I need a hand,
and where did she go?

1012
01:20:06,704 --> 01:20:09,570
Are you saying accepting your help
obligates me?

1013
01:20:11,509 --> 01:20:13,534
Is there any other way to see it?

1014
01:20:24,190 --> 01:20:26,920
Here's a little suitcase...

1015
01:20:26,994 --> 01:20:29,860
shocked that it's being used.

1016
01:20:38,773 --> 01:20:41,571
There's no way to pack
for this trip.

1017
01:21:05,337 --> 01:21:09,239
- You're still comin', aren't you?
- yes,

1018
01:21:10,477 --> 01:21:12,604
I would like to know
exactly where we are going.

1019
01:21:14,548 --> 01:21:18,985
just south of Baltimore, Maryland,
and I know what you're gonna say next.

1020
01:21:19,053 --> 01:21:22,318
I mean, I think I know,

1021
01:21:22,391 --> 01:21:24,722
I'm not sure...

1022
01:21:24,792 --> 01:21:27,420
but I think so,

1023
01:21:27,496 --> 01:21:29,794
There's no need for me to bring
anything dressy?

1024
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:33,333
I didn't know...

1025
01:21:33,403 --> 01:21:35,927
if we were eating in any restaurants
that have dress codes.

1026
01:21:37,474 --> 01:21:40,931
Well, I don't...

1027
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:43,138
I mean, maybe,

1028
01:21:43,214 --> 01:21:45,477
I mean, yes! Let's.

1029
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:48,410
Gotcha.

1030
01:21:51,591 --> 01:21:55,583
- What did you think I was gonna ask?
- Whether crabs were in season now.

1031
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:59,756
Okay, then. Good night.

1032
01:22:04,538 --> 01:22:07,473
Anything unusual in the dog's diet?

1033
01:22:09,945 --> 01:22:12,243
- Everybody gets their own cage?
- Certainly.

1034
01:22:12,314 --> 01:22:15,545
Put him in with that one, not that one.
Builds his confidence.

1035
01:22:17,019 --> 01:22:18,452
Lip kiss.

1036
01:22:22,325 --> 01:22:24,816
I love you.
I'll miss you.

1037
01:22:24,894 --> 01:22:28,022
Hey! Real sensitive!

1038
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:31,859
- Bye.
- Call me when you get settled.

1039
01:22:40,746 --> 01:22:42,771
Don't worry, Mom!
Have a good time!

1040
01:22:42,848 --> 01:22:45,544
- Don't run.
- Have fun! Don't worry!

1041
01:22:45,618 --> 01:22:49,952
- Have fun, but don't run.
- Grandma will take care of me! Bye!

1042
01:22:54,362 --> 01:22:57,819
- I'm sorry I'm not taking you myself.
- So am I, Frank.

1043
01:22:57,899 --> 01:22:59,833
Give me a hug.

1044
01:23:01,804 --> 01:23:04,533
- Everything's gonna be okay, all right?
- Yeah.

1045
01:23:04,606 --> 01:23:06,199
Soak it up.

1046
01:23:07,943 --> 01:23:10,434
It's your last chance for a hug
for a few days.

1047
01:23:25,797 --> 01:23:27,732
Thank you for being on time.

1048
01:23:32,906 --> 01:23:35,135
Carol the waitress.
Simon the fag.

1049
01:23:38,679 --> 01:23:41,443
Hello.
Holy God! Who did that to you?

1050
01:23:44,453 --> 01:23:47,047
Um, I was attacked.

1051
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:49,556
I walked in on some men robbing me...

1052
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:52,616
and I was hospitalized.

1053
01:23:54,697 --> 01:23:57,929
- I almost died.
- Let's do the small talk in the car.

1054
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,935
Let's go.

1055
01:24:02,139 --> 01:24:04,299
How are you, sir?
Oh, I was gonna do that for you.

1056
01:24:04,375 --> 01:24:06,502
It's all right.
Where should we sit?

1057
01:24:06,578 --> 01:24:09,843
I, uh... Well, there's
no place cards or anything.

1058
01:24:09,914 --> 01:24:14,351
You look like you need more room,
so I'll sit in the back.

1059
01:24:29,303 --> 01:24:32,635
Never a break. Never.

1060
01:24:32,707 --> 01:24:35,642
Thank you for the seat.
That was very thoughtful.

1061
01:24:36,578 --> 01:24:40,377
- You look like you're crowded in there.
- It's all right.

1062
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:44,719
Thanks.

1063
01:24:53,798 --> 01:24:55,662
Thank you.

1064
01:24:57,235 --> 01:24:59,169
You're welcome.

1065
01:25:03,075 --> 01:25:06,169
I've got the whole trip programmed.

1066
01:25:10,684 --> 01:25:14,211
I'm just kidding.
I wanted to see what you'd do.

1067
01:25:15,923 --> 01:25:18,084
Seriously.

1068
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:20,821
We got good stuff here.

1069
01:25:31,107 --> 01:25:36,374
When it's not always raining
There'll be days like this

1070
01:25:36,447 --> 01:25:39,177
- When there's no complaining
- I like this music.

1071
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:41,410
There'll be days like this

1072
01:25:41,485 --> 01:25:44,045
I like this music.

1073
01:25:44,121 --> 01:25:46,817
Like the flick of a switch

1074
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:49,416
Well, my mama told me

1075
01:25:49,494 --> 01:25:52,793
There'll be days like this

1076
01:25:52,866 --> 01:25:58,464
Well, I'm looking for my girl
I wonder where can she be

1077
01:25:58,539 --> 01:26:02,703
Simon, I'm sure they did something
really off for you to feel this way...

1078
01:26:02,776 --> 01:26:06,178
but when it comes to your parents
or your kid...

1079
01:26:06,247 --> 01:26:10,651
something will always be off for you
unless you set it straight.

1080
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:15,487
And maybe this thing happened to you
just to give you a chance to do that.

1081
01:26:15,558 --> 01:26:18,493
Nonsense.
And you want to know why?

1082
01:26:18,562 --> 01:26:21,497
Anybody here who's interested in what
Melvin has to say, raise their hand.

1083
01:26:31,176 --> 01:26:34,042
Do you want to know what happened
with my parents?

1084
01:26:34,113 --> 01:26:35,842
Yes.

1085
01:26:36,917 --> 01:26:38,680
- When I was a kid...
- No, wait.

1086
01:26:38,752 --> 01:26:41,618
I'm gonna pull over,
give you my full attention.

1087
01:26:45,258 --> 01:26:50,424
Well, I always painted,
and my mother always encouraged it.

1088
01:26:50,498 --> 01:26:54,628
I mean, she was really
sort of fabulous about it, actually.

1089
01:26:54,703 --> 01:26:57,797
And she used to...

1090
01:26:57,873 --> 01:27:01,502
I was too young to think
that there was anything wrong with it.

1091
01:27:01,577 --> 01:27:06,810
She was very natural,
so she used to pose nude for me.

1092
01:27:08,285 --> 01:27:11,014
And I always thought,
or I guess I assumed...

1093
01:27:11,088 --> 01:27:13,147
that my father knew about it.

1094
01:27:13,224 --> 01:27:15,055
This stuff is pointless.

1095
01:27:15,126 --> 01:27:18,721
- Hey, let him finish...
- You like sad stories? Wanna hear mine?

1096
01:27:18,797 --> 01:27:19,957
Stop.

1097
01:27:23,135 --> 01:27:26,866
Go ahead, really.
Please don't let him stop you.

1098
01:27:28,808 --> 01:27:34,474
One day he walked in and found us,
and he started screaming.

1099
01:27:34,548 --> 01:27:37,313
My father didn't come out of his room
for 1 1 years.

1100
01:27:37,384 --> 01:27:40,410
He used to hit me on the hands
with a yardstick if I made a mistake...

1101
01:27:40,489 --> 01:27:42,353
playing the piano.

1102
01:27:46,496 --> 01:27:47,928
Go ahead, Simon.

1103
01:27:47,997 --> 01:27:51,525
So you said he came in your room
and he was yelling?

1104
01:27:51,601 --> 01:27:54,228
- Uh-huh.
- Please, come on.

1105
01:27:56,373 --> 01:27:59,342
- He was, um...
- Come on.

1106
01:27:59,410 --> 01:28:02,276
Yeah, I know. I was...

1107
01:28:02,347 --> 01:28:04,781
I remember I was defending
my mother...

1108
01:28:04,849 --> 01:28:07,477
and I was trying to, you know...

1109
01:28:07,552 --> 01:28:10,749
make peace in the lamest way.

1110
01:28:10,823 --> 01:28:13,348
I said...

1111
01:28:13,426 --> 01:28:15,917
"She's not naked. It's art."

1112
01:28:18,932 --> 01:28:20,627
He started hitting me...

1113
01:28:22,202 --> 01:28:26,002
and he beat me unconscious.

1114
01:28:26,074 --> 01:28:29,373
And he talked to me
less and less after that.

1115
01:28:29,444 --> 01:28:32,606
I mean, he knew what I was
before I did.

1116
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:36,241
And the morning
that I left for college...

1117
01:28:36,318 --> 01:28:38,253
he walked into my room...

1118
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:41,289
and he held out his hand...

1119
01:28:41,358 --> 01:28:44,122
and it was filled with money.

1120
01:28:45,363 --> 01:28:49,732
A big, sweaty wad of money.

1121
01:28:51,737 --> 01:28:55,571
And he said, "I don't want you
to ever come back."

1122
01:28:57,077 --> 01:29:01,172
And I just grabbed him
and I hugged him...

1123
01:29:01,246 --> 01:29:03,841
and he turned and walked out.

1124
01:29:16,163 --> 01:29:19,496
We all have these terrible stories
to get over, and you...

1125
01:29:19,569 --> 01:29:21,092
That's not true.

1126
01:29:21,169 --> 01:29:23,967
Some of us have great stories,
pretty stories...

1127
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:26,167
that take place at lakes...

1128
01:29:26,242 --> 01:29:30,144
with boats and friends
and noodle salad.

1129
01:29:30,214 --> 01:29:32,148
just no one in this car.

1130
01:29:32,216 --> 01:29:33,843
But a lot of people...

1131
01:29:33,918 --> 01:29:37,786
that's their story:
good times, noodle salad.

1132
01:29:37,856 --> 01:29:41,883
What makes it so hard
is not that you had it bad...

1133
01:29:41,961 --> 01:29:45,659
but that you're that pissed
that so many others had it good.

1134
01:29:45,732 --> 01:29:50,032
- No! I don't think so.
- Not it at all, really.

1135
01:29:51,571 --> 01:29:53,003
Not it at all, huh?

1136
01:29:56,978 --> 01:30:00,778
Let's go to the hotel.

1137
01:30:00,849 --> 01:30:03,511
Tomorrow you'll see if you can get
another big wad...

1138
01:30:03,585 --> 01:30:05,849
of sweaty money out of his hand.

1139
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:17,723
Can I ask you a personal question?

1140
01:30:20,704 --> 01:30:22,262
Sure.

1141
01:30:23,675 --> 01:30:25,609
You ever get an erection
over a woman?

1142
01:30:29,315 --> 01:30:32,772
I mean, wouldn't your life
be easier if you weren't...

1143
01:30:32,852 --> 01:30:34,944
You consider your life easy?

1144
01:30:36,989 --> 01:30:39,924
All right.
I give you that one.

1145
01:30:43,630 --> 01:30:45,063
Nice packin'.

1146
01:30:54,977 --> 01:30:57,137
- Hey, Spence.
- Hi, Mom,

1147
01:30:57,948 --> 01:31:00,712
- Wait till you hear,
- Why are you out of breath?

1148
01:31:00,784 --> 01:31:03,844
Mom, I ran over a guy
and scored a goal,

1149
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:07,913
- You did?
- yeah, He was big, Charlie, you know,

1150
01:31:07,992 --> 01:31:10,358
That's great!

1151
01:31:10,429 --> 01:31:13,397
- yep, Amazing,
- Oh, my God, right?

1152
01:31:13,465 --> 01:31:16,161
Mom, we're playing again,
Gotta go, Bye,

1153
01:31:16,236 --> 01:31:18,294
Wait.Just tell me...

1154
01:31:19,973 --> 01:31:24,342
- He scored a goal,
- Mom, I don't believe it.

1155
01:31:24,410 --> 01:31:26,571
- Oh, you would've died.
- Oh, my God,!

1156
01:31:28,414 --> 01:31:33,352
My son was outside playing soccer.
Come on.

1157
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:36,583
Take me out for a good time.
Take me out dancing.

1158
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:37,784
Dancing?

1159
01:31:38,894 --> 01:31:41,521
I can't. I'm exhausted.

1160
01:31:41,596 --> 01:31:44,429
Oh, come on. Please, come on.

1161
01:31:46,936 --> 01:31:48,426
All right.

1162
01:31:48,504 --> 01:31:50,665
You're right.

1163
01:31:50,741 --> 01:31:55,678
- Are you sad or something?
- No, I'm nervous.

1164
01:31:55,747 --> 01:31:59,615
It would be very rough, Carol,
if you weren't along.

1165
01:31:59,684 --> 01:32:01,447
What a nice compliment.

1166
01:32:14,735 --> 01:32:15,894
I'm happy.

1167
01:32:17,571 --> 01:32:19,629
And you're my date.

1168
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:22,899
Let's get dressed.

1169
01:32:32,188 --> 01:32:34,621
- I'm gonna jump in the shower.
- Okay.

1170
01:32:34,691 --> 01:32:37,182
- I'll be right with you.
- Okay.

1171
01:33:15,104 --> 01:33:17,902
- All set?
- Yeah.

1172
01:33:21,978 --> 01:33:24,538
- Do you sell hard-shell crabs?
- Yes.

1173
01:33:24,614 --> 01:33:27,412
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

1174
01:33:36,328 --> 01:33:39,023
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

1175
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,390
Thank you.

1176
01:33:42,468 --> 01:33:44,129
Good evening.

1177
01:33:44,203 --> 01:33:47,366
- Hi. You have hard-shells, right?
- Stop asking everyone.

1178
01:33:47,441 --> 01:33:50,773
just him. Okay, you can answer.
We worked it out.

1179
01:33:50,844 --> 01:33:52,334
Yes, we do.

1180
01:33:52,379 --> 01:33:55,405
Oh, and I can give you
a tie and jacket.

1181
01:33:55,483 --> 01:33:58,452
- What?
- They require a tie and jacket.

1182
01:33:58,521 --> 01:33:59,953
We have some available.

1183
01:34:13,937 --> 01:34:15,871
No, I'm not putting that on.

1184
01:34:16,874 --> 01:34:21,004
I'm also not going to let you inject me
with the plague, either.

1185
01:34:21,079 --> 01:34:23,377
It's such a nice place.

1186
01:34:23,449 --> 01:34:25,940
You probably have these dry cleaned
all the time, don't you?

1187
01:34:26,018 --> 01:34:27,849
Actually, I don't think so.

1188
01:34:35,962 --> 01:34:39,955
Well, you just wait here.

1189
01:34:41,402 --> 01:34:42,835
Excuse me.

1190
01:34:54,818 --> 01:34:56,752
Good evening.

1191
01:34:58,689 --> 01:35:01,681
- I need a coat and tie.
- Well, come on in.

1192
01:35:05,763 --> 01:35:08,926
- Uh, that one.
- This one?

1193
01:35:09,001 --> 01:35:11,730
That one, yeah.
And this tie.

1194
01:35:21,081 --> 01:35:22,743
Excuse me.

1195
01:35:26,687 --> 01:35:30,589
She's here.
We saved a table for you.

1196
01:35:30,659 --> 01:35:34,322
- Thanks.
- Should I get her for you?

1197
01:35:34,396 --> 01:35:37,627
No, that's all right.
I'll just watch.

1198
01:35:43,339 --> 01:35:47,241
- Can I buy you another drink?
- This is plenty. No, thank you.

1199
01:36:31,395 --> 01:36:32,692
Oh. Wait.

1200
01:37:03,632 --> 01:37:06,192
You look so se...

1201
01:37:08,203 --> 01:37:10,694
You look, uh, great.

1202
01:37:13,075 --> 01:37:14,565
You look great.

1203
01:37:25,023 --> 01:37:26,513
You want to dance?

1204
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:31,459
Well, I've been thinking about that
since you brought it up before.

1205
01:37:31,530 --> 01:37:33,588
- And?
- No.

1206
01:37:35,902 --> 01:37:38,393
I don't get this place.

1207
01:37:39,673 --> 01:37:43,371
They make me buy a new outfit
and let you in in a housedress.

1208
01:37:44,345 --> 01:37:46,006
I don't get it.

1209
01:37:47,081 --> 01:37:49,605
What? No. Wait. Why?

1210
01:37:49,684 --> 01:37:52,745
Where are you goin'? Why?

1211
01:37:55,791 --> 01:37:59,489
I didn't mean it that way.
You ought to sit down.

1212
01:37:59,562 --> 01:38:02,759
You can still give me the dirty look.
just sit down and give it to me.

1213
01:38:02,832 --> 01:38:05,061
Pay me a compliment, Melvin.

1214
01:38:05,134 --> 01:38:08,228
I need one. Quick.

1215
01:38:08,305 --> 01:38:11,741
You have no idea how much
what you just said hurt my feelings.

1216
01:38:11,810 --> 01:38:15,142
The mono-minute someone gets
that they need you...

1217
01:38:15,213 --> 01:38:17,373
they threaten to walk out.

1218
01:38:17,450 --> 01:38:20,543
A compliment is something nice
about somebody else.

1219
01:38:22,188 --> 01:38:25,918
- Now or never.
- Okay.

1220
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:36,569
And mean it.

1221
01:38:48,418 --> 01:38:49,851
Can we order first?

1222
01:38:57,762 --> 01:39:00,286
Two hard-shell crab dinners!

1223
01:39:00,364 --> 01:39:02,093
Pitcher of ice-cold beer!

1224
01:39:02,167 --> 01:39:03,998
Baked or fries?

1225
01:39:04,069 --> 01:39:05,502
Fries.

1226
01:39:09,876 --> 01:39:12,174
One baked, one fried.

1227
01:39:12,245 --> 01:39:14,940
I'll tell your waiter.

1228
01:39:15,014 --> 01:39:16,845
My waiter.

1229
01:39:16,917 --> 01:39:22,480
Okay, now, I got a real great
compliment for you...

1230
01:39:22,556 --> 01:39:24,683
and it's true.

1231
01:39:24,758 --> 01:39:26,886
I'm so afraid you're about
to say something awful.

1232
01:39:27,963 --> 01:39:30,523
Don't be pessimistic.
It's not your style.

1233
01:39:31,767 --> 01:39:34,291
Okay, here I go.

1234
01:39:35,738 --> 01:39:37,899
Clearly a mistake.

1235
01:39:39,643 --> 01:39:44,012
I've got this, what, ailment?

1236
01:39:48,085 --> 01:39:51,612
My doctor, a shrink that
I used to go to all the time...

1237
01:39:51,690 --> 01:39:54,454
says that in 50 or 60 percent
of the cases...

1238
01:39:54,526 --> 01:39:56,926
a pill really helps.

1239
01:39:57,997 --> 01:39:59,430
I hate pills.

1240
01:39:59,498 --> 01:40:01,762
Very dangerous thing, pills.

1241
01:40:01,835 --> 01:40:06,637
I'm using the word "hate" here
about pills.

1242
01:40:06,707 --> 01:40:09,675
My compliment is, that night...

1243
01:40:09,743 --> 01:40:13,201
when you came over and told me
that you would never...

1244
01:40:14,816 --> 01:40:19,048
All right, well, you were there.
You know what you said.

1245
01:40:19,121 --> 01:40:21,681
Well, my compliment to you is...

1246
01:40:22,993 --> 01:40:27,555
the next morning
I started taking the pills.

1247
01:40:31,235 --> 01:40:33,897
I don't quite get
how that's a compliment for me.

1248
01:40:39,578 --> 01:40:42,138
You make me want to be a better man.

1249
01:40:55,029 --> 01:40:58,089
That's maybe the best compliment
of my life.

1250
01:41:03,305 --> 01:41:05,330
Well, maybe I overshot a little.

1251
01:41:05,407 --> 01:41:08,342
I was aiming at just enough
to keep you from walking out.

1252
01:41:20,825 --> 01:41:22,759
How's it goin' with those pills?

1253
01:41:24,296 --> 01:41:26,958
Good, I hope, I hope...

1254
01:41:32,605 --> 01:41:34,038
It's little by little.

1255
01:41:37,311 --> 01:41:40,246
It's exhausting talking like this.

1256
01:42:00,870 --> 01:42:04,202
Do you ever let a romantic moment make
you do something you know is stupid?

1257
01:42:05,743 --> 01:42:06,835
Never.

1258
01:42:08,346 --> 01:42:10,974
Here's the trouble with "never."

1259
01:42:33,208 --> 01:42:36,473
- You don't owe me that.
- That wasn't payment.

1260
01:42:38,914 --> 01:42:41,849
When you first came in to breakfast,
when I first saw you...

1261
01:42:41,917 --> 01:42:43,407
I thought you were handsome.

1262
01:42:45,522 --> 01:42:47,456
Then, of course, you spoke.

1263
01:42:50,695 --> 01:42:54,027
So now that your...

1264
01:42:54,098 --> 01:42:56,362
soft little underbelly
is all exposed...

1265
01:42:56,435 --> 01:42:59,528
tell me, why did you
bring me here?

1266
01:43:06,012 --> 01:43:07,445
It's...

1267
01:43:11,384 --> 01:43:13,318
a personal question.

1268
01:43:13,387 --> 01:43:16,788
- Tell me, even if you're scared.
- Scared?

1269
01:43:16,857 --> 01:43:19,155
Tell me why you wanted me here.

1270
01:43:21,129 --> 01:43:22,653
It's okay.

1271
01:43:22,731 --> 01:43:25,666
If you ask me, I'll say yes.

1272
01:43:26,968 --> 01:43:29,459
Well, I...

1273
01:43:29,505 --> 01:43:33,272
I don't know.

1274
01:43:33,342 --> 01:43:36,038
There's a lot of reasons.

1275
01:43:36,113 --> 01:43:39,514
I thought... one thought...
maybe if you had sex with Simon...

1276
01:43:39,583 --> 01:43:41,244
What?

1277
01:43:43,421 --> 01:43:46,083
Well, that's just one idea.

1278
01:43:46,157 --> 01:43:48,022
That's why you brought me?

1279
01:43:48,094 --> 01:43:50,891
Like I'm a what...

1280
01:43:50,963 --> 01:43:53,659
and I owe you what?

1281
01:43:53,733 --> 01:43:56,166
I don't know why I brought you.

1282
01:43:56,236 --> 01:44:00,798
That was just one thought that I had.
It came out first. That's all it was.

1283
01:44:00,874 --> 01:44:03,206
I thought, you kiss him, me.

1284
01:44:03,277 --> 01:44:06,212
When you two seemed to hit it off...

1285
01:44:06,281 --> 01:44:08,476
No, wait. That's... I didn't mean...

1286
01:44:08,550 --> 01:44:10,813
Forget what I said about Simon.

1287
01:44:10,886 --> 01:44:13,822
- I'll never forget you said it.
- It's a mistake.

1288
01:44:15,558 --> 01:44:17,184
It was a mistake.

1289
01:44:23,667 --> 01:44:25,998
- Hello, this is Fred Bishop,
-And Betty,

1290
01:44:26,070 --> 01:44:28,334
We're sorry to be unable
to take your call right now,

1291
01:44:28,406 --> 01:44:30,772
Please leave a message
with all the pertinent information,

1292
01:44:30,842 --> 01:44:32,605
-Say good-bye,
- Good-bye,

1293
01:44:32,677 --> 01:44:34,406
Thank you,

1294
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:36,414
It's Simon.

1295
01:44:37,984 --> 01:44:39,918
I'm in town.

1296
01:44:45,058 --> 01:44:48,186
Folks, you haven't been out later
that 1 0:00 in your entire lives.

1297
01:44:48,262 --> 01:44:50,663
Please pick up the phone.

1298
01:44:53,168 --> 01:44:54,601
Really.

1299
01:44:59,441 --> 01:45:01,466
I'll try you in the morning.

1300
01:45:01,544 --> 01:45:03,842
I need to see you...

1301
01:45:03,913 --> 01:45:07,178
or at least get you
to answer the phone.

1302
01:45:15,761 --> 01:45:18,627
How are you?

1303
01:45:18,697 --> 01:45:21,028
- Is this gonna be your room?
- Our room.

1304
01:45:21,099 --> 01:45:24,193
I don't wanna see him,
and he's not gonna knock on your door.

1305
01:45:24,269 --> 01:45:25,361
What happened?

1306
01:45:26,572 --> 01:45:28,507
Don't ask.

1307
01:45:31,077 --> 01:45:34,012
- Can you not be so violent?
- I don't think so.

1308
01:45:34,081 --> 01:45:36,379
- Do you need help...
- No!

1309
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:41,885
I'm taking a big bath
and ordering a big meal.

1310
01:45:41,957 --> 01:45:43,150
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

1311
01:45:45,528 --> 01:45:48,895
I'm tired of my own complaints.
I gotta get some new thoughts.

1312
01:45:48,965 --> 01:45:50,591
What are you thinking about?

1313
01:45:52,134 --> 01:45:53,499
How to die, mostly.

1314
01:45:55,572 --> 01:45:58,804
Can you believe, in our little mix,
you're the good roommate?

1315
01:46:12,458 --> 01:46:14,949
- Good night.
- Good night.

1316
01:46:57,743 --> 01:46:59,677
Hold it.

1317
01:47:19,668 --> 01:47:22,761
- I have to draw you.
- Huh?

1318
01:47:24,607 --> 01:47:26,404
I have to draw you.

1319
01:47:28,578 --> 01:47:31,172
Absolutely not. I'm a lot
more shy than people think.

1320
01:47:31,247 --> 01:47:33,272
- I give off the wrong impression.
- I have to.

1321
01:47:33,351 --> 01:47:35,216
I haven't sketched anything
in weeks.

1322
01:47:35,287 --> 01:47:38,051
Stop staring.
Do a vase.

1323
01:47:39,357 --> 01:47:40,449
But you're beautiful.

1324
01:47:40,525 --> 01:47:43,358
Your skin, your long neck...

1325
01:47:44,796 --> 01:47:47,526
the back, the line of you.

1326
01:47:49,670 --> 01:47:52,536
You're why cavemen
chiseled on walls.

1327
01:47:56,143 --> 01:47:57,633
All right. Cut me a break.

1328
01:48:21,204 --> 01:48:23,229
The next thing I know she's...

1329
01:48:23,307 --> 01:48:26,470
sitting right there next to me.

1330
01:48:26,544 --> 01:48:29,206
Well, it's not right
to go into details.

1331
01:48:29,281 --> 01:48:31,841
I got nervous.

1332
01:48:31,917 --> 01:48:34,579
I screwed up.
I said the wrong thing.

1333
01:48:38,191 --> 01:48:40,216
Where if I hadn't...

1334
01:48:40,293 --> 01:48:43,729
I could be in bed right now
with a woman...

1335
01:48:43,798 --> 01:48:48,565
who if you make her laugh,
you got a life.

1336
01:48:51,106 --> 01:48:54,007
Instead, I'm here with you.

1337
01:48:54,076 --> 01:48:57,704
No offense, but a moron
pushing the last legal drug.

1338
01:49:02,653 --> 01:49:04,587
jameson, soda back.

1339
01:49:07,124 --> 01:49:09,319
I'm sorry.
I don't care how you put this.

1340
01:49:09,393 --> 01:49:13,454
- We're being naughty here, pal.
- No.

1341
01:49:13,532 --> 01:49:16,729
This is great.
This is so great.

1342
01:49:16,802 --> 01:49:19,930
I swear to God,
my hand won't even keep up.

1343
01:49:20,005 --> 01:49:22,269
- Hold it.
- I'm just turning.

1344
01:49:22,341 --> 01:49:25,139
- Then hold that. Hold any of them.
- Okay. This?

1345
01:49:25,212 --> 01:49:28,978
It doesn't matter.
My hand's not even bothering me.

1346
01:49:29,049 --> 01:49:32,041
I can't... I just...

1347
01:49:32,119 --> 01:49:35,145
I can't get the angle
with this cast.

1348
01:49:39,394 --> 01:49:41,328
Oh, careful.

1349
01:49:52,877 --> 01:49:55,505
Coming in. It's late.

1350
01:50:02,087 --> 01:50:03,749
Did you have sex with her?

1351
01:50:04,657 --> 01:50:06,624
You're sure you
don't want your shampoos?

1352
01:50:11,732 --> 01:50:14,223
Sorry.

1353
01:50:14,301 --> 01:50:17,429
I didn't know
she was still here.

1354
01:50:17,504 --> 01:50:20,530
- Did you have sex with her?
- To hell with sex.

1355
01:50:20,608 --> 01:50:23,099
It was better than sex.
We held each other.

1356
01:50:24,612 --> 01:50:28,070
What I need
he gave me great.

1357
01:50:28,150 --> 01:50:31,142
I'll get dressed in a hurry.

1358
01:50:36,059 --> 01:50:37,993
I just love her.

1359
01:50:44,135 --> 01:50:46,069
How are you doin'?

1360
01:51:01,956 --> 01:51:04,447
- Hello?
- Mom? Hi.

1361
01:51:04,491 --> 01:51:08,051
Hello, Simon, you were right,
We were home last night,

1362
01:51:08,129 --> 01:51:10,153
Do you have to whisper?
I can barely hear you.

1363
01:51:10,231 --> 01:51:12,926
- I'm not a screamer,
- No, no.

1364
01:51:13,001 --> 01:51:15,697
It was the luckiest thing
you didn't answer last night.

1365
01:51:15,771 --> 01:51:17,898
- your father hasn't been feeling well,
- I can't hear you.

1366
01:51:17,974 --> 01:51:20,875
- It's too late to start, Hold on,
- Hold for what?

1367
01:51:20,943 --> 01:51:23,309
What are you gonna do?
Where are you going?

1368
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:26,281
I get why you're angry with me,
but it's no snap to...

1369
01:51:26,350 --> 01:51:29,341
- He's talking to his parents.
- Then you listen to me.

1370
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:32,548
Truly no grudges, okay?
Truly.

1371
01:51:32,624 --> 01:51:36,890
It was odd that you didn't come see me
when you heard I was hurt, but...

1372
01:51:36,962 --> 01:51:40,397
- We almost did,
- I don't even want to talk about it.

1373
01:51:40,466 --> 01:51:43,526
The important thing is
that your son is happy.

1374
01:51:43,603 --> 01:51:46,696
- you do sound different,
- Yes, I'm working again.

1375
01:51:46,773 --> 01:51:50,073
- Good, About money...
- I don't need anything.

1376
01:51:50,143 --> 01:51:52,634
I'll drop you a line
from wherever I land.

1377
01:51:52,713 --> 01:51:55,739
Then it's up to you to make
the next move, and I hope you do.

1378
01:51:55,817 --> 01:51:57,842
He's gonna want to stay.

1379
01:51:57,919 --> 01:52:01,548
They'll want to take a ride
to the lake or whatever.

1380
01:52:01,624 --> 01:52:04,650
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- Bye, dear,

1381
01:52:04,727 --> 01:52:07,753
- He's gonna feel stirred up.
- Bye, Mom.

1382
01:52:07,830 --> 01:52:10,161
We'll probably have
a good five-hour drive.

1383
01:52:10,233 --> 01:52:12,929
- It'll give us a chance to relax...
- So?

1384
01:52:13,003 --> 01:52:15,494
- and be together alone.
- I'm coming with you.

1385
01:52:16,407 --> 01:52:19,399
- What about your parents?
- No, I'll take care of myself.

1386
01:52:19,477 --> 01:52:23,243
What are you talking about?
You got real problems.

1387
01:52:24,183 --> 01:52:27,515
I know. I'm a little bit nervous.

1388
01:52:27,586 --> 01:52:31,420
Suddenly everything
seems so easy.

1389
01:52:31,490 --> 01:52:34,618
Carol, a load has been lifted.

1390
01:52:37,297 --> 01:52:40,528
- One night with me.
- You think you're kidding.

1391
01:52:42,203 --> 01:52:46,435
- Ah, geez. No choice.
- I got a gift for you.

1392
01:52:46,507 --> 01:52:50,205
Nothing like no choice
to make you feel at home.

1393
01:52:50,280 --> 01:52:52,475
Let me see.

1394
01:52:52,549 --> 01:52:54,982
Ah. Gorgeous.

1395
01:52:55,051 --> 01:52:59,954
Do it then, and pick up the dog.
I can't believe you let it stay there.

1396
01:53:00,024 --> 01:53:01,456
Good-bye.

1397
01:53:03,027 --> 01:53:05,290
Your luck's running.

1398
01:53:05,362 --> 01:53:08,958
They sublet your place.
You're homeless.

1399
01:53:10,969 --> 01:53:14,336
Frank's got a line on another place
you can use for now.

1400
01:53:14,407 --> 01:53:17,934
- Another place where?
- Does it matter?

1401
01:53:22,583 --> 01:53:24,743
It doesn't.

1402
01:53:25,653 --> 01:53:28,018
I'm fine. Like the hat?

1403
01:53:29,991 --> 01:53:31,652
I'm sorry.

1404
01:53:55,154 --> 01:53:58,681
I love you

1405
01:54:01,427 --> 01:54:03,987
For sentimental reasons

1406
01:54:04,063 --> 01:54:06,623
I don't want to hear
that music right now.

1407
01:54:06,699 --> 01:54:09,690
- You said you liked it.
- I don't.

1408
01:54:12,106 --> 01:54:15,508
- This one has a meaning.
- It's your call...

1409
01:54:15,576 --> 01:54:18,477
but I don't want to hear it,
if that means anything.

1410
01:54:38,236 --> 01:54:40,567
Yes, sir. All right.

1411
01:54:40,638 --> 01:54:44,904
Here's the keys
to my apartment.

1412
01:54:44,977 --> 01:54:49,346
You go up there and wait.
I'm gonna take Carol home.

1413
01:54:50,282 --> 01:54:52,773
- I'll take a bus.
- No, I'll take you.

1414
01:54:59,393 --> 01:55:02,021
Can you come here?

1415
01:55:02,096 --> 01:55:05,031
- I don't care what you did for me.
- What's wrong?

1416
01:55:06,334 --> 01:55:08,825
I don't think
I want to know you anymore.

1417
01:55:08,904 --> 01:55:11,599
All you do is make me
feel bad about myself.

1418
01:55:15,178 --> 01:55:17,112
You have my number.

1419
01:55:19,616 --> 01:55:21,709
Let him take you home.

1420
01:55:21,785 --> 01:55:23,720
I don't want to.

1421
01:55:24,823 --> 01:55:28,020
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1422
01:55:37,870 --> 01:55:39,804
Don't say anything.

1423
01:55:42,776 --> 01:55:46,576
I gotta get ahold of Frank,
see where I'm hanging my hat.

1424
01:55:46,648 --> 01:55:48,979
Well...

1425
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:51,814
I think you're gonna
have to camp it here.

1426
01:55:51,886 --> 01:55:54,947
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, look! There's Verdell!

1427
01:55:55,024 --> 01:55:56,354
Look at you!

1428
01:55:56,425 --> 01:55:58,483
- Come here.
- Look at you.

1429
01:56:04,534 --> 01:56:07,094
Mommy and Daddy are home.

1430
01:56:09,573 --> 01:56:12,599
Sorry.
You're just fun to mess with.

1431
01:56:15,079 --> 01:56:20,210
They rented your place furnished.
jackie brought your personal things.

1432
01:56:20,285 --> 01:56:23,721
They were gonna set you up in here.
It's an extra room.

1433
01:56:23,790 --> 01:56:25,724
I never use it.

1434
01:56:25,792 --> 01:56:28,818
It's got good light.
No other choice, really.

1435
01:56:28,895 --> 01:56:30,829
I'm coming.

1436
01:56:33,033 --> 01:56:37,527
It's nice.

1437
01:56:37,605 --> 01:56:39,698
It looks good.

1438
01:56:41,076 --> 01:56:44,011
They got your music...

1439
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:46,640
paintings, paints.

1440
01:56:46,716 --> 01:56:48,911
Have to say
they did a good job.

1441
01:56:52,222 --> 01:56:54,816
Well, it's gonna be okay, huh?

1442
01:56:54,891 --> 01:56:57,882
- Cozy, huh?
- Yeah.

1443
01:57:03,602 --> 01:57:04,693
Thank you.

1444
01:57:06,938 --> 01:57:08,428
You overwhelm me.

1445
01:57:15,515 --> 01:57:16,913
I love you.

1446
01:57:23,491 --> 01:57:25,925
I tell you, buddy.

1447
01:57:25,994 --> 01:57:29,430
I'd be the luckiest guy alive
if that did it for me.

1448
01:57:42,312 --> 01:57:44,542
Make yourself at home.

1449
01:57:46,784 --> 01:57:50,151
Anything else in the bag?

1450
01:57:50,221 --> 01:57:53,850
- I played soccer while you were away.
- Yeah, I know.

1451
01:57:53,926 --> 01:57:57,384
I love my cookbook.

1452
01:57:57,463 --> 01:58:00,830
It's great. It's got all
these wonderful recipes in here.

1453
01:58:00,901 --> 01:58:04,428
It says something for shark.
I never fixed shark before.

1454
01:58:04,504 --> 01:58:07,962
"Shark With A Bite."
Would you like that, Spencer?

1455
01:58:08,041 --> 01:58:11,067
There's some cookies here
called "Wasps' Nest."

1456
01:58:14,383 --> 01:58:17,910
Where is my big, hairy boy?

1457
01:58:17,987 --> 01:58:20,478
Where is he?

1458
01:58:20,557 --> 01:58:23,958
Where is my beautiful boy?
Sweetheart.

1459
01:58:25,328 --> 01:58:27,592
Oh, you're in bed.

1460
01:58:27,664 --> 01:58:29,427
Oh, no.

1461
01:58:30,433 --> 01:58:32,094
Yeah.

1462
01:58:34,071 --> 01:58:38,371
I just didn't think Verdell
should get too comfortable...

1463
01:58:38,443 --> 01:58:40,378
- sleeping in here.
- Look.

1464
01:58:40,445 --> 01:58:43,005
- It's not gonna...
- The dog's already comfortable.

1465
01:58:46,953 --> 01:58:48,283
Is this okay?

1466
01:58:53,093 --> 01:58:54,890
It's me. Hi!

1467
01:58:54,962 --> 01:58:56,725
Yes.

1468
01:58:56,797 --> 01:59:00,528
He took me in. Yes.
It's Carol for you.

1469
01:59:00,602 --> 01:59:03,799
I practically fainted
when I walked in.

1470
01:59:03,873 --> 01:59:05,966
- Take the dog.
- I gotta go.

1471
01:59:06,041 --> 01:59:10,137
-Just take the dog.
- Oh, come here.

1472
01:59:11,814 --> 01:59:13,941
Come on. Move faster.

1473
01:59:14,018 --> 01:59:18,044
- Don't limp. Move fast.
- Good luck.

1474
01:59:32,038 --> 01:59:35,131
- Yeah.
- How are you doing?

1475
01:59:35,209 --> 01:59:39,770
- Not so hot.
- Why? What's wrong?

1476
01:59:39,847 --> 01:59:43,009
I don't know whether I'm
being sensible or hard on you.

1477
01:59:43,083 --> 01:59:45,176
Maybe both, Maybe,

1478
01:59:45,253 --> 01:59:49,383
See, right there, I don't know
whether you're being cute or crazy.

1479
01:59:49,457 --> 01:59:52,585
- Cute.
- Don't answer everything I say.

1480
01:59:52,661 --> 01:59:56,119
just listen to me, okay?
Listen to me.

1481
01:59:57,601 --> 02:00:01,866
It's really something
that you're looking after Simon.

1482
02:00:01,938 --> 02:00:04,999
And what I said on the street...

1483
02:00:05,075 --> 02:00:07,475
that was a bad thing to say.

1484
02:00:07,545 --> 02:00:11,880
It made me sick to my stomach.
It was a bad thing to say.

1485
02:00:14,420 --> 02:00:19,152
I'd be lying if I didn't say
I enjoy your company.

1486
02:00:20,727 --> 02:00:23,958
But the truth is,
you do bother me enormously.

1487
02:00:24,030 --> 02:00:26,625
And I know that it...

1488
02:00:26,701 --> 02:00:29,430
I think that it's better for me
to not have contact with you...

1489
02:00:29,502 --> 02:00:31,163
because you're not ready...

1490
02:00:31,240 --> 02:00:33,469
and you're a pretty old guy
to not be ready...

1491
02:00:33,542 --> 02:00:36,169
and I'm too old to ignore that.

1492
02:00:36,245 --> 02:00:39,509
But there were
extraordinary kindnesses...

1493
02:00:39,581 --> 02:00:41,515
that did take place.

1494
02:00:49,492 --> 02:00:51,119
Anyway, thanks for the trip.

1495
02:00:53,597 --> 02:00:56,122
Good night.

1496
02:00:56,201 --> 02:00:57,964
Okay if I say something now?

1497
02:01:03,109 --> 02:01:04,201
Go ahead.

1498
02:01:06,813 --> 02:01:08,940
I should have danced with you.

1499
02:01:13,954 --> 02:01:15,888
Good night.

1500
02:01:37,014 --> 02:01:40,882
- Are you gonna talk to me or not?
- I'm coming.

1501
02:01:52,131 --> 02:01:55,498
- What did she say?
- That I'm a great guy.

1502
02:01:55,568 --> 02:01:57,262
Extraordinary.

1503
02:01:57,337 --> 02:02:00,704
And she doesn't want
contact with me.

1504
02:02:02,710 --> 02:02:04,644
I'm dying here.

1505
02:02:06,881 --> 02:02:09,145
Because...

1506
02:02:09,217 --> 02:02:11,309
you love her.

1507
02:02:12,987 --> 02:02:16,354
And you people are supposed
to be sensitive and sharp?

1508
02:02:16,425 --> 02:02:19,394
Then you tell me why.
You're the one who's "dying here."

1509
02:02:20,830 --> 02:02:21,922
I don't know.

1510
02:02:21,998 --> 02:02:24,762
- Let me sleep on it.
- Oh, come on.

1511
02:02:24,835 --> 02:02:28,202
- I'll figure it out.
- Oh, please.

1512
02:02:30,375 --> 02:02:33,003
I'm stuck.

1513
02:02:33,077 --> 02:02:36,376
I can't get back
to my old life.

1514
02:02:38,617 --> 02:02:40,812
She's evicted me from my life.

1515
02:02:40,887 --> 02:02:42,821
Did you really like it that much?

1516
02:02:42,889 --> 02:02:45,551
Well, it's better than this.

1517
02:02:45,625 --> 02:02:48,458
Look, you,
I'm very intelligent.

1518
02:02:48,529 --> 02:02:51,498
If you're gonna give me hope,
you gotta do better than you're doing.

1519
02:02:51,565 --> 02:02:55,592
If you can't be at least mildly
interesting, then shut the hell up.

1520
02:02:55,669 --> 02:02:59,800
I'm drowning here,
and you're describing the water!

1521
02:02:59,876 --> 02:03:01,399
Picking on me won't help.

1522
02:03:04,013 --> 02:03:06,311
If that's true,
I'm really in trouble.

1523
02:03:09,686 --> 02:03:12,280
Melvin, do you know
where you're lucky?

1524
02:03:16,828 --> 02:03:18,455
You know who you want.

1525
02:03:20,832 --> 02:03:23,858
I would take your seat
any day.

1526
02:03:23,936 --> 02:03:26,097
So do something about it.

1527
02:03:26,172 --> 02:03:28,834
Go over there now, tonight.
Don't sleep on it.

1528
02:03:28,909 --> 02:03:32,401
It's not always good
to let things calm down.

1529
02:03:32,479 --> 02:03:35,380
You can do this, Melvin.
You can do this.

1530
02:03:35,450 --> 02:03:38,851
Pull the stops.
Tell her how you feel.

1531
02:03:38,920 --> 02:03:42,686
- You can do this.
- Hey, I'm charged here.

1532
02:03:42,757 --> 02:03:46,124
- Yes, you are.
- She might kill me if I go over.

1533
02:03:46,195 --> 02:03:49,096
Then get in your jammies
and I'll read you a story.

1534
02:03:49,165 --> 02:03:51,223
I really think
you have a chance here.

1535
02:03:51,301 --> 02:03:55,170
The best thing you have going for you
is a willingness to humiliate yourself.

1536
02:03:55,238 --> 02:03:58,640
So go over there, do this.
Catch her off guard.

1537
02:04:04,248 --> 02:04:06,183
- Okay.
- Okay.

1538
02:04:08,687 --> 02:04:11,121
- Thanks a lot.
- Okay.

1539
02:04:13,125 --> 02:04:15,059
Here I go.

1540
02:04:23,905 --> 02:04:25,668
What's wrong?

1541
02:04:29,244 --> 02:04:30,939
I forgot to lock the door.

1542
02:05:50,102 --> 02:05:52,036
What do you want, Melvin?

1543
02:05:53,173 --> 02:05:56,199
- I'm sorry I woke you.
- I wasn't asleep.

1544
02:06:01,149 --> 02:06:02,945
What a break.

1545
02:06:05,153 --> 02:06:07,986
Is it a secret
what you're doing here?

1546
02:06:11,427 --> 02:06:12,859
I had to see you.

1547
02:06:17,101 --> 02:06:18,193
Because?

1548
02:06:21,805 --> 02:06:24,569
It relaxes me.

1549
02:06:26,311 --> 02:06:30,509
I'd feel better sitting outside
your apartment on the curb...

1550
02:06:30,582 --> 02:06:31,844
than any other place...

1551
02:06:31,917 --> 02:06:35,249
I can think of or imagine.

1552
02:06:35,321 --> 02:06:38,051
No, wait.
That's overstating.

1553
02:06:38,124 --> 02:06:41,822
I'd rather be sitting inside
on the steps...

1554
02:06:41,895 --> 02:06:44,089
'cause I don't want to
get my feet in the gutter.

1555
02:06:44,165 --> 02:06:45,722
- What would that serve?
- Stop it!

1556
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:49,395
Why can't I just have
a normal boyfriend? Why?

1557
02:06:49,470 --> 02:06:53,133
just a regular boyfriend
who doesn't go nuts on me.

1558
02:06:53,208 --> 02:06:57,269
Everybody wants that, dear.
It doesn't exist.

1559
02:07:00,483 --> 02:07:03,577
Oh, I'm sorry.

1560
02:07:03,653 --> 02:07:06,588
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1561
02:07:12,097 --> 02:07:13,620
Boyfriend.

1562
02:07:17,936 --> 02:07:22,270
Come on in and try not
to ruin everything by being you.

1563
02:07:23,609 --> 02:07:26,476
Maybe we could live
without the wisecracks.

1564
02:07:31,118 --> 02:07:33,052
Maybe we could.

1565
02:07:59,350 --> 02:08:02,786
It feels a little confined in here.

1566
02:08:02,855 --> 02:08:04,947
Let's take a walk.

1567
02:08:07,761 --> 02:08:10,285
See, it's 4:00 in the morning.

1568
02:08:10,362 --> 02:08:13,923
A walk sounds
a little screwy to me...

1569
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:15,490
if you don't mind.

1570
02:08:15,568 --> 02:08:20,005
Well, if you need an excuse...

1571
02:08:20,074 --> 02:08:23,840
there's a bakery on the corner
that will be open soon.

1572
02:08:23,911 --> 02:08:26,402
That way we're not screwy.

1573
02:08:26,448 --> 02:08:30,441
just two people
that like warm rolls.

1574
02:08:34,724 --> 02:08:36,157
Okay.

1575
02:08:54,547 --> 02:08:56,879
What are you doing?

1576
02:08:56,949 --> 02:08:59,885
I still want you to hear
part of that car song.

1577
02:08:59,952 --> 02:09:01,887
You don't have to...

1578
02:09:08,496 --> 02:09:10,760
And darlin'

1579
02:09:10,832 --> 02:09:13,926
I'm never lonely

1580
02:09:14,002 --> 02:09:17,994
Whenever you're in sight

1581
02:09:18,074 --> 02:09:20,008
Thank you.

1582
02:09:21,444 --> 02:09:23,378
You know, I was hoping...

1583
02:09:38,330 --> 02:09:42,631
I'm sorry. Whatever this is
is not gonna work.

1584
02:09:51,979 --> 02:09:54,709
- I'm feel...
- What?

1585
02:09:56,784 --> 02:09:59,218
I'm feeling better, Carol.

1586
02:10:00,521 --> 02:10:04,049
Even though
it may seem that way now...

1587
02:10:04,126 --> 02:10:07,220
you don't know me all that well.

1588
02:10:07,297 --> 02:10:08,787
I'm not the answer for you.

1589
02:10:08,865 --> 02:10:12,596
Hey, I've got
a great compliment for you.

1590
02:10:14,137 --> 02:10:17,436
- You know what?
-Just let me...

1591
02:10:17,508 --> 02:10:19,442
Let me talk.

1592
02:10:25,450 --> 02:10:29,181
I might be the only person
on the face of the Earth...

1593
02:10:29,254 --> 02:10:31,779
that knows you're
the greatest woman on Earth.

1594
02:10:31,858 --> 02:10:35,794
I might be the only one
who appreciates...

1595
02:10:35,863 --> 02:10:40,493
how amazing you are in every
single thing that you do...

1596
02:10:40,568 --> 02:10:43,468
and how you are with Spencer.

1597
02:10:43,537 --> 02:10:44,799
Spence.

1598
02:10:45,974 --> 02:10:49,808
In every single thought you have
and how you say what you mean...

1599
02:10:49,879 --> 02:10:52,439
and how you almost always
mean something...

1600
02:10:52,515 --> 02:10:57,111
that's all about
being straight and good.

1601
02:10:59,589 --> 02:11:02,113
I think most people
miss that about you.

1602
02:11:02,192 --> 02:11:04,320
I wonder how they
can watch you...

1603
02:11:04,395 --> 02:11:07,386
bring their food
and clear their tables...

1604
02:11:07,465 --> 02:11:11,128
and never get that they just met
the greatest woman alive.

1605
02:11:12,304 --> 02:11:14,498
And the fact that I get it...

1606
02:11:14,574 --> 02:11:16,508
makes me feel good...

1607
02:11:18,377 --> 02:11:19,901
about me.

1608
02:11:28,923 --> 02:11:31,688
Is that something that's...

1609
02:11:31,759 --> 02:11:34,193
bad for you to be around
for you?

1610
02:11:49,580 --> 02:11:50,842
I'm gonna grab ya.

1611
02:11:52,717 --> 02:11:55,550
I didn't mean for that
to be a question.

1612
02:11:55,620 --> 02:11:57,554
I'm gonna grab ya.

1613
02:12:21,115 --> 02:12:23,083
I know I can do better than that.

1614
02:12:47,412 --> 02:12:49,744
Better.
Definitely better.

1615
02:12:55,489 --> 02:12:56,582
See?

1616
02:13:14,531 --> 02:13:16,408
Warm rolls.

1617
02:13:25,769 --> 02:13:27,646
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.

1617
02:13:28,305 --> 02:14:28,800
