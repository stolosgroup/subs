2
00:01:12,538 --> 00:01:16,876
One, two, three, four...

3
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:20,272
Right.

4
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:26,237
- Left.
- Look straight ahead.

5
00:02:28,155 --> 00:02:30,991
Left or right?

6
00:02:33,494 --> 00:02:38,666
- Left. No, right.
- Left or right?

7
00:02:38,749 --> 00:02:40,251
Right.

8
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:46,549
- How much anxiety medicine do you take?
- I've stopped them.

9
00:02:46,632 --> 00:02:52,555
So you sleep better, without
nightmares and migraines? Okay.

10
00:02:52,638 --> 00:02:56,475
- Do you have a girlfriend at the moment?
- No.

11
00:02:56,559 --> 00:03:01,689
- But sex is good?
- Yeah, good.

12
00:03:01,772 --> 00:03:06,777
Alright! Why do you have nosebleeds then?

13
00:03:06,861 --> 00:03:11,949
- I do not know.
- I looked at your results...

14
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:16,537
It could be worse. Poor cardiovascular
and concentration tests...

15
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,417
I do not know if we can let
you return to service.

16
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:28,007
- I want to return.
- You'll get a decision in the mail.

17
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:34,180
Do not take it that way. The anxiety and
hallucinations are following effects.

18
00:03:34,263 --> 00:03:38,767
It affects many coming home.

19
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:06,754
- Can you stop here?
- At the next stop.

20
00:04:06,837 --> 00:04:09,715
Stop here, please.

21
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,680
Thank you.

22
00:04:47,294 --> 00:04:49,296
Mom?

23
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,928
Mom?

24
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,858
- Why are you late?
- Are we late or something?

25
00:06:40,157 --> 00:06:43,160
- What's he doing?
- Who?

26
00:06:43,244 --> 00:06:46,747
- He is coming too.
- I don't know him, he is Lebanese.

27
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:49,416
- Lebanese?
- Yes, you have a problem with that?

28
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,963
- No, on the contrary.
- We have to protect Arabs...

29
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:59,385
- 500€ per day. Better than first place.
- Yes, but not much...

30
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:04,890
- Do you remember the job in Malta?
- How much was it? 800 per day?

31
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:08,978
- Yes, something like that.
- Do you want more?

32
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:13,482
- Yes, it would have been nice.
- We'll see next time.

33
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:16,443
- Is it here?
- Yes.

34
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:35,004
- Yes?
- Good day. We are security guards.

35
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:19,965
Here it is.
Change, then come back.

36
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:25,304
- Last time was messed up because of him.
- What happened?

37
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:30,392
Shit himself with logistics.
We stood there like idiots without stuff.

38
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:35,815
- Who's in your team?
- Same guys as last time.

39
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:38,776
- Team Leader is Michaël.
- Good luck...

40
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:43,781
- Yes, he's a real idiot.
- Have you bought cigarettes? No?

41
00:08:43,864 --> 00:08:46,867
- No.
- What is this shit tie?

42
00:08:46,951 --> 00:08:52,289
You look so underdressed!
Look at how nice Vincents dressed.

43
00:08:52,373 --> 00:08:56,252
- If you are ready, we can begin.
- What do we start with?

44
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:59,672
- Courtyard
- Franck and Vincent take the house.

45
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:06,846
- Vincent, take the first floor?
- Yes, I'm coming.

46
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:14,436
This is a large area, so
check all the sides properly.

47
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:21,485
I have added an extra five guys.
They may come in handy.

48
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:28,033
- Who?
- I deployed them. We'll take the house.

49
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:36,000
- Has anyone checked newly hired staff?
- Yes, everything like that is checked.

50
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,503
- Who handled it?
- Me.

51
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:45,384
- Vincent?
- Yes.

52
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:48,554
- Vincent ?!
- Yes I am here.

53
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:51,307
- Where are you?
- In the living room.

54
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,518
The large couch?
I can't see you.

55
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:02,818
- Can you see me now?
- I can't see you. Move.

56
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,779
- Here?
- Yes, now I see you.

57
00:10:05,863 --> 00:10:09,116
There are blind spots.

58
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:15,623
The corridor seems ok.
- Vincent, are you there?

59
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:20,920
Vincent? Vincent, you hear me ?!

60
00:11:38,956 --> 00:11:43,502
Yes, we are still here.
We are still in southern France.

61
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:49,216
Mom, what time is it?

62
00:11:50,384 --> 00:11:56,849
And what is the big pointer for?
What is the big pointer?

63
00:11:56,932 --> 00:12:00,895
I'm talking on the phone, honey.

64
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:19,890
Has Franck also checked here?
Come, we have a briefing.

65
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:30,234
- Well!
- Then we go. Do you hear?

66
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:36,157
You've all seen the stairs into the hall.
It goes to the basement, the rally point.

67
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,870
We evacuates via the back door,
to the left after the farm.

68
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:45,332
- Tom takes the guest list at the hall.
- Prime Minister!

69
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,502
- No, Home Secretary.
- Radio Show!

70
00:13:48,586 --> 00:13:51,297
- Sure.
- Sure.

71
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,193
- Is there a lot of people at the hall?
- Yes.

72
00:14:12,276 --> 00:14:15,321
- Need help?
- No, I'm Kevin.

73
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:20,284
- VIP parking lot is getting full.
- What should I do?

74
00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:25,539
You have to keep the place of politicians.
Did the minister come?

75
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:27,666
No.

76
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:38,260
- Look at those breasts and bleached hair!
- Who?

77
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:42,348
Two o'clock. Are they real?
Is she his wife or daughter?

78
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,601
- Cut the crap and stay focused!
- We are focused.

79
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:51,148
- Did you hear Duroy speech?
- Yeah, not bad. It was captivating.

80
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,666
- Excuse me? Can you get ice?
- What did you say?

81
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,335
Ice.

82
00:15:56,714 --> 00:16:00,801
- What a place! It goes well for Whalid.
- Better than you.

83
00:16:00,885 --> 00:16:05,598
- Yes, Lebanese earn big.
- He is French.

84
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:11,395
Yeah, he is French, but it
will vex Duroy eventually.

85
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:14,398
Whalids not going to ruin everything?

86
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:19,403
Monetary stories with Qatar can
spoil the presidential election.

87
00:16:19,487 --> 00:16:25,117
- Quiet. We have people who take care of stuff.
- It only goes up in the measurements.

88
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:31,624
Not in municipal elections, but
Duroy return to parliament.

89
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:35,419
It is still too early.

90
00:16:41,842 --> 00:16:45,304
Vincent? Denis here.

91
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:47,473
Vincent? Denis here!

92
00:16:47,556 --> 00:16:51,936
- Come to the entrance.
- Why?

93
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,605
- Quick!
- I'm coming.

94
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:58,419
- Good evening.
- Mr. Duroy.

95
00:17:58,502 --> 00:18:03,883
Good evening, Minister. Head to the
second parking lot, VIP parking.

96
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:11,056
Straight ahead, to the right of the house.
Where you will be received. Have a nice evening!

97
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:25,404
Hold the list. I'll be right back.

98
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:41,378
- Good evening.
- I'm a minister.

99
00:18:41,462 --> 00:18:44,632
- What's your name?
- Derradji, Tarik.

100
00:18:51,972 --> 00:18:55,059
You are not on the list, sir.

101
00:18:55,142 --> 00:19:00,022
Can you leave?
You are blocking the gates.

102
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:09,865
Yes? Call me. I have a problem
at the gate with an idiot.

103
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,868
Move, please.

104
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:32,805
Yes? I'm standing outside. One moment.
- It's for you.

105
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,102
Yes, hello?

106
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:47,027
Okay. Understood.

107
00:19:47,111 --> 00:19:49,488
You can go.

108
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:08,549
- Vincent, what happened?
- Hold this. I'll be right back.

109
00:22:30,357 --> 00:22:35,779
... Only according to the contract
and it says clearly

110
00:22:35,863 --> 00:22:42,077
- You get paid last, after all
intermediaries who have not been paid yet.

111
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:47,541
What does that mean? Is that a threat?
Do not come here and threaten us!

112
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:52,213
- Do not take that tone!
- Are you all right, sir?

113
00:22:52,296 --> 00:22:56,675
- Yes, wait outside.
- Very well.

114
00:23:24,912 --> 00:23:29,917
- What did you hear?
- Nothing, sir.

115
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,797
- Go and fetch my wife. Immediately!
- Yes, sir.

116
00:23:47,935 --> 00:23:51,605
Vincent Denis.
Have you seen Whalids wife?

117
00:23:51,689 --> 00:23:56,277
- What the fuck... Where are you?
- I'm looking for Whalids wife, a blonde.

118
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:03,159
- As everyone... Give me more info.
- Blonde, floral dress, bare back.

119
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:06,620
- Ok, I know.
- Have you seen her?

120
00:24:06,704 --> 00:24:09,623
- Yes, by the pool.
- Okay, thanks.

121
00:24:13,878 --> 00:24:17,548
Ghost, come! Are you hungry?

122
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:24,555
Excuse me...Your husband is looking for you

123
00:24:26,515 --> 00:24:28,517
Okay.

124
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:40,196
- Did you find her?
- Yes, she's going now.

125
00:26:09,076 --> 00:26:13,581
Here.

126
00:26:13,664 --> 00:26:17,168
Want another one? Here.

127
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:23,048
What is it with you?

128
00:26:36,645 --> 00:26:40,065
Come here. Come.

129
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:44,028
- Franck, want a beer?

130
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:50,077
- Vince! Come!
- Do you have a lighter to open this?

131
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,248
- Take my phone.
- Can you open a beer with a phone?

132
00:26:54,331 --> 00:26:58,335
- What?
- Whalids family must be guarded the next 2 days.

133
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:04,406
- 3000 euros a week, 900 for two days.
- Why do you offer me the job?

134
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:09,119
Why? I know you need money
and you are my friend.

135
00:27:09,203 --> 00:27:13,290
- You think I can't go back?
- Stop it!

136
00:27:13,374 --> 00:27:19,088
- Why do you not do it?
- Well? Otherwise I ask Franck.

137
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:24,677
It's just babysitting. You drive them,
run errands, take them to the beach...

138
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,638
- Okay.
- So you'll do it?

139
00:27:27,721 --> 00:27:31,350
- I'll come late in the morning.
- Cool.

140
00:28:24,194 --> 00:28:28,407
- Vincent! He's up there.
- Thanks.

141
00:28:31,535 --> 00:28:35,289
- You look good.
- Yes, that's good.

142
00:28:41,128 --> 00:28:47,217
- Did you take Tramadol?
- Yes, Acupan also, it is the same.

143
00:28:49,303 --> 00:28:54,683
- And just ten drops of Rivotril.
- Yes I know. No Lyrica?

144
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:59,772
No, you can come back
tomorrow afternoon.

145
00:28:59,855 --> 00:29:04,985
- I can't I work tomorrow.
- Okay

146
00:29:21,168 --> 00:29:24,588
- Yes?
- Hello I'm security, Vincent Loreau.

147
00:29:24,672 --> 00:29:26,674
- Come in.
- Thanks.

148
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:44,692
- You'll stay here.
- Thank you, sir.

149
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:07,172
Good day.

150
00:30:07,256 --> 00:30:12,803
- Do you have something to eat, please?
- Theres spaghetti, it's over there.

151
00:30:12,886 --> 00:30:14,930
Thank you.

152
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,603
Eat!

153
00:30:35,284 --> 00:30:37,286
Imad!

154
00:30:41,582 --> 00:30:44,877
I'm calling from Geneva.
It's only two days.

155
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:51,175
It makes me calmer.
Why do you go back there again?

156
00:30:51,258 --> 00:30:56,513
- I'll be back in two days.
- What is going on?

157
00:30:56,597 --> 00:30:59,308
There is no danger.

158
00:31:44,478 --> 00:31:49,817
I know. Ali is fine, but
he's a little lonely.

159
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:56,740
- Excuse me, I'm coming in to locking up.

160
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:22,599
I will speed up France with the
help of everyone's support

161
00:32:22,683 --> 00:32:27,938
- In a modern country, where one does
not occupy factories and burn cars.

162
00:32:28,022 --> 00:32:33,027
Mr. Duroy, there are rumors your
campaign finance and foreign accounts.

163
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:38,615
My candidacy annoying people is one
thing, but we will not stoop so low!

164
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:44,747
I know where the attacks are coming from.
If you have a clear conscience, you will be fine.

165
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:50,878
- Are you thinking about an alliance with the center?
- Right, left and center out.

166
00:32:50,961 --> 00:32:54,298
Only the will to gather France counts.

167
00:32:54,381 --> 00:33:00,012
A France that will evolve,
without ideology and prejudice.

168
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:41,720
Hello?

169
00:33:45,641 --> 00:33:49,520
- Hello?
- A problem?

170
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:57,986
- No, someone called mistakes.
- Relax, I am here if it's something.

171
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:01,740
- Go back to bed.
- Mom!

172
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:42,156
What is it with you?

173
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,908
Are you hungry?

174
00:35:05,512 --> 00:35:11,018
Sorry if I'm disturbing.
Are you okay if I take a coffee?

175
00:35:11,101 --> 00:35:13,103
Sure.

176
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:20,277
Want?

177
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,494
Yes please.

178
00:35:33,624 --> 00:35:35,626
Thank you.

179
00:35:36,752 --> 00:35:41,590
We will now display a report that
was filmed with great adversity

180
00:35:41,674 --> 00:35:47,513
- By a young Syrian woman, a student
in Raqqa, in northern Syria.

181
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:51,725
What you are about to see has been secertly
filmed by a young woman in Raqqa

182
00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:54,812
the capital of the self
proclaimed islamic state.

183
00:35:54,895 --> 00:36:01,068
Shes wearing the compulsory niqāb and risking
her life with a camera hidden in her handbag

184
00:36:01,151 --> 00:36:08,367
as she walks along the street, you can feel the atmosphere of the city,
thats been under Islamist rule for just a few months.

185
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:11,912
Everywhere people are carrying guns.
Even women.

186
00:36:11,996 --> 00:36:18,419
Wearing niqāb and holding Kalashnikovs.
This ones going to a childrens park.

187
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:23,382
Is it not cold?

188
00:36:26,593 --> 00:36:30,347
Do you sleep if you drink coffee?

189
00:36:32,266 --> 00:36:38,397
I sleep bad these days.
I wake up every three hours.

190
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,693
- In the army there was every two hours.
- You were in the military?

191
00:36:42,776 --> 00:36:46,864
- Yes, I'm still.
- What are you doing here?

192
00:36:46,947 --> 00:36:51,410
We tend to take odd
jobs between orderings.

193
00:36:51,493 --> 00:36:55,914
- Will you go back?
- Yes.

194
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:18,103
Do you hear that?

195
00:37:19,646 --> 00:37:22,149
What?

196
00:37:23,525 --> 00:37:27,946
Rumble. Do you hear them?

197
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,865
No.

198
00:37:40,209 --> 00:37:42,920
Want?

199
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,132
Yes, please.

200
00:38:11,907 --> 00:38:14,243
I'm going to bed.

201
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:19,164
Good night!

202
00:38:28,215 --> 00:38:30,884
Come here!

203
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:14,321
Good morning. We're going to the beach.
Shall we wait for you in the car?

204
00:40:21,161 --> 00:40:24,248
Are you thinking about the presidential election?

205
00:40:24,331 --> 00:40:28,752
The French are tired of talk.

206
00:40:28,836 --> 00:40:33,966
They are tired of living on contributions.
They want jobs.

207
00:40:34,049 --> 00:40:36,844
Get in!

208
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,142
Are you okay?

209
00:40:52,151 --> 00:40:56,030
- Turn right where the road ends.
- What did you say?

210
00:40:56,113 --> 00:40:59,867
Turn right where the road ends, thanks.

211
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:11,462
- Are you excited to go home to London?
- Yes.

212
00:41:11,545 --> 00:41:17,009
Next week we're gonna go home. Okay?
You're gonna see your friends.

213
00:41:17,092 --> 00:41:24,183
If you want tonight when we get home we
can call Paul. Alright? Maybe he's already back.

214
00:42:56,567 --> 00:42:59,236
What is this?!

215
00:43:06,869 --> 00:43:08,954
Stop!

216
00:43:09,038 --> 00:43:11,040
Stop!

217
00:43:14,418 --> 00:43:16,420
Stop!

218
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,175
Are you deaf?!

219
00:43:28,265 --> 00:43:31,060
- We were being followed.
- By whom?!

220
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,198
Get out!

221
00:43:54,124 --> 00:43:55,626
Hell...

222
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,052
48-89.

223
00:45:08,365 --> 00:45:11,201
Come on! Come!

224
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:18,959
Run off!

225
00:45:44,401 --> 00:45:47,071
Good. And you?

226
00:45:47,154 --> 00:45:49,823
No, I'm at the beach.

227
00:45:49,907 --> 00:45:55,245
It's absolutely gorgeous today! Yea.

228
00:46:29,988 --> 00:46:33,867
Ali! Leave him alone.

229
00:46:50,158 --> 00:46:51,658
He's cute

230
00:48:53,816 --> 00:48:57,611
Ali, come! We're going home now!

231
00:49:19,466 --> 00:49:25,514
- What should Souad make for dinner?
- I do not know.

232
00:49:25,598 --> 00:49:30,144
- You want pizza?
- No.

233
00:49:30,227 --> 00:49:33,022
- Chips?
- No.

234
00:49:35,441 --> 00:49:38,152
Are you tired?

235
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:55,377
Get in!

236
00:49:58,172 --> 00:50:02,384
Are you okay?
Buckles get stuck? There you go.

237
00:50:34,542 --> 00:50:37,628
Ali, hide!

238
00:50:37,711 --> 00:50:41,382
No! No!

239
00:51:12,246 --> 00:51:15,541
Be seated, okay?
Look at me! Be seated!

240
00:51:19,295 --> 00:51:21,964
Hide.

241
00:52:02,004 --> 00:52:05,674
She says she does not know anything.

242
00:52:11,388 --> 00:52:13,808
I'll take it.

243
00:52:18,103 --> 00:52:21,315
Are you watching, please?

244
00:52:21,398 --> 00:52:25,194
- What do you do for sir Whalid?
- I already told your colleague.

245
00:52:25,277 --> 00:52:32,451
- I watch the family when he's gone.
- He did not give you anything before he left?

246
00:52:32,535 --> 00:52:34,286
- No.
- Are you sure?

247
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:36,664
Certain.

248
00:52:37,665 --> 00:52:43,879
- Okay. You can go.
- Should I not sign any documents?

249
00:52:43,963 --> 00:52:46,006
No.

250
00:53:04,608 --> 00:53:07,111
You can go.

251
00:53:07,194 --> 00:53:10,447
- Do I get my gun?
- The container, yes.

252
00:53:14,952 --> 00:53:17,538
Now we go.

253
00:53:18,622 --> 00:53:22,668
Relax.
It works out with protection.

254
00:53:28,716 --> 00:53:32,094
Why did they have a lot of questions?

255
00:53:32,178 --> 00:53:36,515
- Mom?
- What is it love? Are you hot?

256
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:41,437
Should I open a bit?
Now we count red cars, okay?

257
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:46,901
- Why did they have a lot of questions?
- They asked about my husband.

258
00:53:46,984 --> 00:53:53,532
Really? They asked me a lot about
him as well. Strange, huh?

259
00:53:53,616 --> 00:53:57,328
Do not you think that's weird?

260
00:54:00,956 --> 00:54:05,586
The assault didn't
interest them at all!

261
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:46,460
They're not answering.

262
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:53,592
Come.

263
00:55:18,993 --> 00:55:21,203
Wait here, please.

264
00:56:05,206 --> 00:56:07,166
Souad?

265
00:56:07,249 --> 00:56:09,251
Souad!

266
00:56:10,211 --> 00:56:12,880
There's nobody here.

267
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:20,554
- Where is Souad and Hassin?
- I have no idea.

268
00:56:20,638 --> 00:56:23,891
It was perhaps those who let them in.

269
00:56:23,974 --> 00:56:26,769
Hello? Yes.

270
00:56:26,852 --> 00:56:29,438
Why?

271
00:56:32,525 --> 00:56:35,110
When?

272
00:56:36,987 --> 00:56:42,827
Can I help?
How long will they keep him?

273
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:46,205
Yeah, but... yeah.

274
00:56:46,288 --> 00:56:51,293
Sure, I'll be here.
Call you back?

275
00:56:54,964 --> 00:56:56,799
Yes.

276
00:57:07,935 --> 00:57:11,730
- My husband is detained at Switzerland's border.
- Who was it?

277
00:57:11,814 --> 00:57:16,861
- His lawyer.
- It's best that we go.

278
00:57:21,115 --> 00:57:23,868
No, we stay here.

279
00:57:24,869 --> 00:57:29,498
- It's not a good idea.
- We stay here, I say!

280
00:57:29,582 --> 00:57:31,917
The police are coming!

281
00:57:34,211 --> 00:57:37,047
As you say.

282
00:59:10,474 --> 00:59:14,474
There's a car outside.
I'll go see who it is.

283
00:59:14,575 --> 00:59:16,075
Okay.

284
01:00:05,988 --> 01:00:07,990
Come here!

285
01:00:27,843 --> 01:00:31,889
- It was just the police.
- Okay.

286
01:00:39,188 --> 01:00:43,609
Tilt your head back. So, yes.

287
01:01:51,385 --> 01:01:55,764
Ali, wash your hands.
Ali, now at once!

288
01:01:56,807 --> 01:01:59,810
Come here.

289
01:01:59,894 --> 01:02:04,899
When your mother asks you to do
something, you obey, okay? Take soap now.

290
01:02:18,287 --> 01:02:22,875
- Eat while it's hot.
- I'm not hungry.

291
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:26,837
You have to eat.

292
01:02:43,187 --> 01:02:45,356
I'm called Vincent.

293
01:02:48,609 --> 01:02:50,152
Jessie.

294
01:03:06,794 --> 01:03:09,630
What drives your husband?

295
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:25,354
Should I say it? He sells weapons.
He's a dealer for weapons contracts.

296
01:03:28,649 --> 01:03:32,278
Come, Ali. It's bedtime.

297
01:03:36,407 --> 01:03:40,911
What was that paper
you looked at recently?

298
01:03:43,289 --> 01:03:50,171
Say what's going on, otherwise I can
not help you, understand? Look at me.

299
01:03:52,715 --> 01:03:57,595
I just want to help you.
Go get them.

300
01:04:22,786 --> 01:04:27,124
I've been studying them for hours!
You understand nothing yet!

301
01:04:31,337 --> 01:04:34,423
Should there be too
complicated for me?

302
01:04:37,885 --> 01:04:41,096
Do not look at me like that.

303
01:04:44,517 --> 01:04:48,062
Do you think I'm stupid?

304
01:04:51,774 --> 01:04:56,237
Your husband has put you in bed
with their sinister affairs.

305
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:02,201
- I mixed myself in his affairs.
- No, but you live well on them.

306
01:05:03,244 --> 01:05:07,081
Look at me, do not you, maybe?
What is it?

307
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:15,464
Are you afraid of me?
Do I scare you? Answer.

308
01:05:45,244 --> 01:05:47,371
It's okay.

309
01:05:47,454 --> 01:05:51,167
It's ok, I say.

310
01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:26,368
- Need anything?
- No.

311
01:06:27,578 --> 01:06:29,663
Okay.

312
01:06:29,747 --> 01:06:31,749
Excuse me?

313
01:06:32,708 --> 01:06:34,710
Yes.

314
01:06:36,962 --> 01:06:41,342
If things get bad here, do you
have another place to go to?

315
01:06:41,425 --> 01:06:45,596
- Relatives? Friends?
- No.

316
01:06:47,431 --> 01:06:51,101
Do not say that you have only your husband?

317
01:06:57,024 --> 01:07:00,986
- I have a friend in Canada, but...
- What?

318
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:04,615
You just need to buy a ticket.

319
01:07:05,616 --> 01:07:09,787
- What are you doing here?
- Should not you sleep?

320
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:13,749
- I can not sleep.
- Come on.

321
01:07:16,043 --> 01:07:23,008
Think of something pleasant.
You might think of a large sea

322
01:07:23,092 --> 01:07:26,470
-like Swimming leisurely in.

323
01:08:24,945 --> 01:08:28,866
Do you know Canada?

324
01:08:30,201 --> 01:08:34,038
No, I've never been there. And you?

325
01:08:36,832 --> 01:08:42,129
- You would have liked it.
- Why do you think that?

326
01:08:42,213 --> 01:08:46,091
I do not know.
I look for myself there.

327
01:08:46,175 --> 01:08:52,765
Not in the cities, but in nature.
Large open spaces and lakes.

328
01:08:55,559 --> 01:08:58,187
As bear hunter.

329
01:09:01,816 --> 01:09:04,527
It's true.

330
01:09:10,866 --> 01:09:12,868
Excuse.

331
01:09:25,381 --> 01:09:28,843
Iran is the Syrian
regime's foremost ally.

332
01:09:28,926 --> 01:09:34,473
Iran, al-Assad alawittregime
a høflighetsskriv-

333
01:09:34,557 --> 01:09:37,560
-angående Their orthodox teachings.

334
01:09:37,643 --> 01:09:42,314
Iran is the Syrian regime's biggest
contributor and weapons supplier.

335
01:09:42,398 --> 01:09:47,820
Iran is the only thing that gives
Syria its massive support.

336
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:54,076
No solution is possible within the framework
of ongoing negotiations with Iran.

337
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:59,165
Iran defends all Shiites
in the Middle East.

338
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:49,340
- What did you say that the person named?
- Imad Whalid.

339
01:10:49,423 --> 01:10:52,259
One moment.

340
01:10:57,181 --> 01:11:02,686
- Hello?
- The case of Mrs. Whalids protection.

341
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:08,526
Yes, my colleague said it, but it says
nothing about protection here in the report.

342
01:11:08,609 --> 01:11:13,656
There was a car outside the house.
It just drove off.

343
01:11:13,739 --> 01:11:16,659
Wait...

344
01:11:16,742 --> 01:11:22,122
- Yes, protection was just lifted.
- When?

345
01:11:22,206 --> 01:11:26,794
I can not say more.
The order came from above.

346
01:11:27,795 --> 01:11:29,839
Hello?

347
01:11:32,091 --> 01:11:34,093
Hello?

348
01:11:40,516 --> 01:11:42,560
Protection is removed.

349
01:12:26,645 --> 01:12:30,941
Denis? It's me.
I need your help.

350
01:12:31,025 --> 01:12:36,572
- What is it? You sound strange.
- I really need your help.

351
01:12:36,655 --> 01:12:41,785
- What do you mean?
- Come now. I'll explain later, okay?

352
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:18,239
Yes?

353
01:13:22,868 --> 01:13:26,163
There was no one outside? So you were careful?

354
01:13:26,247 --> 01:13:29,083
Yes, I say.

355
01:13:34,046 --> 01:13:37,967
- This is Denis.
- Good day. Jessie.

356
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:40,845
- Good day.
- Sit down.

357
01:13:48,978 --> 01:13:52,273
- And what's your name?
- His name is Ali.

358
01:13:52,356 --> 01:13:57,903
Ali? Hello, Ali. I'm Denis.
Do you want something to drink, Ali?

359
01:13:57,987 --> 01:14:03,367
I have cola, orange juice, water...
Whisky?

360
01:14:04,827 --> 01:14:09,957
- Eat up cereal now.
- It's not the same kind as before.

361
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,626
- What?
- It's not the same.

362
01:14:12,710 --> 01:14:17,631
- There is no other.
- You want something different? Bread?

363
01:14:17,715 --> 01:14:24,221
- You eat it like that, okay?!
- Calm, you do not talk to him like that!

364
01:14:33,772 --> 01:14:37,610
What is happening?

365
01:14:39,737 --> 01:14:44,158
- She'll be staying here.
- Yes, you've said it. So what?

366
01:14:44,241 --> 01:14:47,536
Allows you like that papers be reaching?

367
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:51,749
You need some air.

368
01:14:51,832 --> 01:14:54,126
Go for a walk.

369
01:15:03,511 --> 01:15:07,223
what's happening?!

370
01:15:09,391 --> 01:15:15,314
Your lawyer told us to wait here.
Where do you expect us to go?

371
01:15:15,397 --> 01:15:19,610
You promised you were gonna come back.

372
01:15:19,693 --> 01:15:22,613
You're lying. Stop it!

373
01:15:25,533 --> 01:15:28,994
I don't believe you anymore.

374
01:15:29,078 --> 01:15:32,832
Stop bullshitting me Imad , okay?!

375
01:15:51,183 --> 01:15:54,895
Open, please.

376
01:16:44,153 --> 01:16:48,532
We have to leave here. Trust me.

377
01:17:34,495 --> 01:17:37,915
I'm just about to finish packing.

378
01:17:37,998 --> 01:17:43,212
I know.
Are you gonna come get us tomorrow?

379
01:18:07,027 --> 01:18:10,739
Running us to the airport
tomorrow morning?

380
01:18:10,823 --> 01:18:15,703
She should go to a friend in Canada.
I might go with.

381
01:18:15,786 --> 01:18:20,040
- Are you following them?
- Yes, why not?

382
01:18:20,124 --> 01:18:24,003
I don't know...
What the hell are you going to do there?

383
01:18:24,086 --> 01:18:29,633
- Take care of her and the boy.
- You?

384
01:18:29,717 --> 01:18:36,765
- What is it? Does it seem strange?
- I don't know. Did she propose it?

385
01:18:37,892 --> 01:18:42,688
- I don't know...
- She suggest it or not?

386
01:18:42,771 --> 01:18:46,275
I don't know, I say.

387
01:19:50,005 --> 01:19:54,927
We were in Afghanistan together.
I came home earlier, hurt.

388
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:59,223
- But we're from the same neighborhood.
- So you know him well?

389
01:19:59,306 --> 01:20:03,394
- Yes, I do.
- What's with him?

390
01:20:03,477 --> 01:20:10,526
What is with him? It is not easy
to come home. It leaves its mark.

391
01:20:11,652 --> 01:20:16,866
- What do you mean?
- He can not put it behind him.

392
01:20:16,949 --> 01:20:20,786
- I understand.
- That's just how it is.

393
01:20:22,288 --> 01:20:27,126
- Are you American?
- No, German.

394
01:20:27,209 --> 01:20:32,256
- German ?! So what? It does not matter.
- Thanks.

395
01:20:33,591 --> 01:20:37,928
- It does not sound on your accent.
- Yes, a little.

396
01:20:38,012 --> 01:20:41,056
Not much.

397
01:20:41,974 --> 01:20:44,894
- What is it?
- Nothing.

398
01:20:47,188 --> 01:20:50,774
- So, you are German?
- Yes, still...

399
01:20:50,858 --> 01:20:54,069
- And you speak German?
- Yes, sometimes.

400
01:20:54,153 --> 01:20:56,113
- Floating?
- Yes.

401
01:20:56,197 --> 01:21:01,827
Fantastic!
I can say, "Ich liebe dich."

402
01:21:01,911 --> 01:21:06,123
- Yes, it is clear...
- So tiresome you are!

403
01:21:12,421 --> 01:21:17,134
- Is "Jessie" short for "Jessica"?
- Yes.

404
01:21:17,218 --> 01:21:20,262
I have something for you.

405
01:21:21,639 --> 01:21:24,350
What?

406
01:21:30,105 --> 01:21:33,734
- Have you heard it?
- No.

407
01:21:33,818 --> 01:21:36,654
- Like it?
- Very!

408
01:21:36,737 --> 01:21:43,202
My Jessica, my Jessica,
my Jessica, my Jessica...

409
01:21:51,877 --> 01:21:54,046
- Jessica!
- You dance well!

410
01:21:54,129 --> 01:21:56,924
Do you think?

411
01:22:02,471 --> 01:22:06,517
Now hold it! No!

412
01:22:14,733 --> 01:22:17,736
- Now hold it.
- Is everything alright?

413
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:19,989
Yes.

414
01:22:24,368 --> 01:22:27,288
Am I tiring?

415
01:22:32,084 --> 01:22:34,378
- Am I tiring?
- No.

416
01:22:34,461 --> 01:22:38,174
Go and see if the boy asleep.

417
01:22:38,257 --> 01:22:43,721
- Go and see.
- I'll go and see if the boy asleep.

418
01:23:08,746 --> 01:23:12,625
Be seated. Stay with me.

419
01:23:14,418 --> 01:23:17,338
come with me.

420
01:23:18,297 --> 01:23:21,133
- Are you with the child?
- He's gone.

421
01:23:21,217 --> 01:23:24,303
Shit! Go up!
I'm going for the cameras.

422
01:24:18,941 --> 01:24:21,819
- Yes?
- That's me. There is someone in the office.

423
01:24:21,902 --> 01:24:26,699
- Ali!
- Stay here! Look at me. Calm down.

424
01:24:26,782 --> 01:24:30,202
Here. It is loaded.
Hold with both hands.

425
01:24:30,286 --> 01:24:37,459
Will there, you shoot. I'll pick him up
and return. Lock the door behind me.

426
01:24:37,543 --> 01:24:39,587
Okay.

427
01:26:07,925 --> 01:26:10,094
- Stay here.
- What's up?

428
01:26:10,177 --> 01:26:14,014
Stay here!

429
01:26:15,099 --> 01:26:17,852
Be seated there.

430
01:26:25,818 --> 01:26:31,824
This is Denis voicemail.
Leave a message, please.

431
01:27:25,669 --> 01:27:33,344
Typhoon TRAMIER and southwest monsoon has
caused major flooding in Luzon. According to...

432
01:27:49,068 --> 01:27:51,070
Ali!

433
01:27:54,740 --> 01:28:00,538
Ali, it's me. Come here! Come here!

434
01:28:00,621 --> 01:28:03,541
Hold on.

435
01:28:16,011 --> 01:28:18,639
Hold on.

436
01:28:30,943 --> 01:28:35,489
Sit here.

437
01:28:35,573 --> 01:28:40,703
Come on! Look at me. Stay here.

438
01:29:29,418 --> 01:29:32,588
Come here. Hold on tight.

439
01:29:33,589 --> 01:29:35,591
Come!

440
01:29:41,096 --> 01:29:43,098
No worries.

441
01:29:52,691 --> 01:29:55,361
It is clear.

442
01:30:00,658 --> 01:30:03,494
Stay here, okay?

443
01:32:51,412 --> 01:32:53,455
Vincent!

444
01:32:54,832 --> 01:32:58,335
We must get out of here!

445
01:33:00,212 --> 01:33:05,926
- Drive them to the airport.
- You are not coming?

446
01:33:07,261 --> 01:33:09,305
Okay.

447
01:33:13,517 --> 01:33:18,772
- Give me your purse. I put it behind.
- Where's Vincent? Will not he?

448
01:33:18,856 --> 01:33:21,942
No, we have to leave now.

449
01:33:22,026 --> 01:33:27,114
Take your purse. Come on! Jump in!

450
01:33:59,688 --> 01:34:02,171
Vincent...
