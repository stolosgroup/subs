2
00:01:46,054 --> 00:01:48,784
<i>The child is dead.</i>

3
00:01:49,658 --> 00:01:54,994
<i>He breathed just for a moment.
Then he breathed no more.</i>

4
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:59,261
<i>The child is dead. Dead. The child is dead.</i>

5
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:27,685
I'm afraid it will kill her.

6
00:02:27,796 --> 00:02:30,697
My God, she wanted a baby so much.

7
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,191
For such a long time.

8
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:47,904
What can I tell her? What will I say?

9
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,625
You could adopt a child.

10
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,830
She wanted her own.

11
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:50,469
If I may suggest,

12
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:53,013
it even resembles...

13
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:59,815
Your wife need never know.

14
00:04:01,723 --> 00:04:08,219
It would be a blessing to her
and to the child.

15
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:19,597
Are there no relatives?

16
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,767
None.

17
00:04:25,313 --> 00:04:28,214
The mother died, as your own child,

18
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:32,853
in the same moment.

19
00:04:36,057 --> 00:04:38,958
You said it could be ours, but...

20
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:42,463
On this night, Mr Thorn,

21
00:04:42,564 --> 00:04:45,226
God has given you a son.

22
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:28,867
Here's your boy.

23
00:06:11,353 --> 00:06:13,480
<i>Good morning. Come va?</i>

24
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:29,661
- What are you doing home so early?
- Just came to start packing.

25
00:06:29,738 --> 00:06:30,568
What?

26
00:06:30,672 --> 00:06:34,904
<i>We can't waste any time. We're leaving
in the morning. Buongiorno, Carlo.</i>

27
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:37,342
Please, Carlo.

28
00:06:37,445 --> 00:06:39,743
What are you talking about?

29
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:44,911
I am talking about London. I am talking about
the ambassador to the Court of St James.

30
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:49,082
- Well, what about him?
- You're married to him.

31
00:06:49,157 --> 00:06:51,990
I'm what?

32
00:06:52,093 --> 00:06:57,326
It's me. I'm appointed
ambassador to Great Britain.

33
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:35,999
I've already told them yes.
I loved it the minute I saw it.

34
00:07:36,104 --> 00:07:38,163
Well, it's a bit much.

35
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:44,508
Well, nothing's too much for the wife
of the future president of the United States.

36
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:46,944
You know, you're pushy.

37
00:07:47,015 --> 00:07:49,506
Come on. Wait till you see this.

38
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:54,978
Now this, they call his day room.

39
00:07:55,056 --> 00:07:57,149
His day room.

40
00:08:00,862 --> 00:08:03,387
So? How do you like it so far?

41
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:09,635
- Well, it needs some books. To warm it up.
- Couple of books. Warm it up. Yeah.

42
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:48,639
- Something in mind, Mr Ambassador?
- Why don't we have a little look upstairs?

43
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,806
Well, there's no furniture up there, either.

44
00:08:58,486 --> 00:09:02,388
You know, you could be
too sexy for the White House.

45
00:09:33,288 --> 00:09:36,314
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
- I won't be long.

46
00:09:36,424 --> 00:09:38,858
We don't have that much to talk about.

47
00:09:38,927 --> 00:09:42,954
Since when did two old college roommates
not have much to talk about?

48
00:09:43,064 --> 00:09:47,364
Since one of them assumed
the awesome burden of the presidency.

49
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:51,872
- Well, give my regards to the first lady.
- I'll do my best.

50
00:09:52,707 --> 00:09:56,074
Why don't you change you mind,
fly over with me?

51
00:09:56,144 --> 00:09:59,978
No, I'd better stay here
and fool around with Damien.

52
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:05,952
- Where is he?
- He was right behind us...

53
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:08,947
Damien?

54
00:10:20,335 --> 00:10:22,326
Oh, my God, Robert.

55
00:10:22,403 --> 00:10:25,167
Damien! Robert, where could he be?

56
00:10:33,348 --> 00:10:37,114
You little monkey.
Don't you ever do that again.

57
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,747
There you are.

58
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:03,905
- Go.
- Hooray.

59
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:24,229
- Run out of film?
- Just saving a bit for his canonization.

60
00:11:24,332 --> 00:11:27,426
- How's that?
- He's either the heir to the Thorn millions

61
00:11:27,535 --> 00:11:30,663
- or Jesus Christ himself.
- Want a bite, Daddy?

62
00:11:45,153 --> 00:11:48,611
Go on, Damien. Smile. A big birthday smile.

63
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:52,692
Come on. Smile.

64
00:11:52,827 --> 00:11:54,454
Holly.

65
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,663
- I'll take him, ma'am.
- No, I'll take him.

66
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:01,027
Come on.

67
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:35,096
One... two... three...

68
00:12:35,203 --> 00:12:38,434
Let me jump on it, Daddy. Let me jump on it.

69
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,709
Hold on.

70
00:12:58,493 --> 00:13:00,552
Damien.

71
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:06,731
Damien, look at me.

72
00:13:06,868 --> 00:13:09,098
I'm over here.

73
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,628
- Damien, I love you.
- Look. There's Nanny.

74
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:17,036
Look at me, Damien. It's all for you.

75
00:13:24,686 --> 00:13:26,244
Oh, my God.

76
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:42,097
Go, Tom.

77
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:57,541
- Morning. Have you read the papers today?
- No, I haven't.

78
00:14:57,612 --> 00:15:00,877
There was an article on the suicide,
your nanny thatjumped.

79
00:15:01,015 --> 00:15:04,746
- They say that she left a suicide note, sir.
- Not true.

80
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:07,686
Mr Ambassador,
did you know she was on drugs?

81
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:10,349
Would you mind?

82
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:13,621
- Mr Thorn, did she use drugs?
- Not that I know of.

83
00:15:13,694 --> 00:15:17,687
- The article said...
- I don't care what the article said.

84
00:15:20,568 --> 00:15:22,661
I'm sorry.

85
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:27,264
I am sorry.
Will you send me a bill for the damage?

86
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:33,277
No, that's all right, Mr Ambassador.
Let's just say you owe me.

87
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:35,440
Corporal.

88
00:15:36,017 --> 00:15:38,076
OK, outside.

89
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,592
Yes?

90
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:49,459
<i>- There's a Father Brennan here to see you.
- Who?</i>

91
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,930
<i>A priest named Father Brennan from Rome.</i>

92
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:55,661
<i>He says it's a matter of
urgent personal business.</i>

93
00:15:55,736 --> 00:15:58,933
<i>- Never heard of him.
- He says he just needs a minute.</i>

94
00:15:59,073 --> 00:16:03,237
<i>- Something about a hospital.
- Donation time.</i>

95
00:16:03,845 --> 00:16:08,214
- All right, send him in.
- I didn't know you were such a soft touch.

96
00:16:08,282 --> 00:16:11,718
On that trip to Saudi Arabia,
why isn't it the right time?

97
00:16:11,953 --> 00:16:16,652
Well, it's personal, Tom. I just
don't feel like leaving home right now.

98
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:31,930
Yes, Father?

99
00:16:33,374 --> 00:16:37,970
We haven't much time.
You must listen to what I have to say.

100
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,641
All right. What is it?

101
00:16:41,716 --> 00:16:46,380
You must accept Christ as your savior.
You must accept him now.

102
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:54,294
Forgive me, but didn't I understand that you
have a matter of urgent personal business?

103
00:16:54,362 --> 00:16:59,561
You must take Communion.
Drink the blood of Christ and eat his flesh.

104
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:02,693
Only if he is within you
can you defeat the son of the devil.

105
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:06,399
- I see.
- He's killed once. He'll kill again.

106
00:17:06,507 --> 00:17:09,169
He'll kill until everything that's yours is his.

107
00:17:09,277 --> 00:17:13,111
- Father, would you mind...
- Only through Christ can you fight him.

108
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,478
Accept the Lord Jesus.

109
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:18,017
Drink his blood.

110
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,879
I've locked the door, Mr Thorn.

111
00:17:21,956 --> 00:17:25,983
<i>- Yes?
- Would you send for a security guard?</i>

112
00:17:26,294 --> 00:17:29,195
I beg you, Mr Thorn.
Listen to what I have to say.

113
00:17:29,297 --> 00:17:31,822
<i>Ambassador Thorn?</i>

114
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:36,836
I was at the hospital, Mr Thorn,
the night your son was born.

115
00:17:37,571 --> 00:17:40,734
<i>- I witnessed the birth.
- Sir?</i>

116
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:44,370
I beg you.

117
00:17:47,014 --> 00:17:49,744
All right. Stand by.

118
00:17:55,356 --> 00:17:58,723
- What do you want?
- To save you, Mr Thorn.

119
00:17:58,793 --> 00:18:01,523
So Christ will forgive me.

120
00:18:04,465 --> 00:18:07,366
What do you know about my son?

121
00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:10,734
- Everything.
- And what is that?

122
00:18:13,474 --> 00:18:16,534
I saw its mother.

123
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,976
- You saw my wife.
- I saw its mother.

124
00:18:19,046 --> 00:18:21,981
- You're referring to my wife.
- Its mother, Mr Thorn.

125
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:25,576
This is blackmail. Come out and say it.
What are you trying to say?

126
00:18:25,653 --> 00:18:28,383
His mother was aja...

127
00:18:28,956 --> 00:18:32,187
- Everything OK?
- You sounded strange. The door was locked.

128
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:36,559
- I want this gentleman escorted out of here.
- OK, let's go.

129
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:40,790
Accept Christ each day.

130
00:18:40,868 --> 00:18:42,961
Drink his blood.

131
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,478
- Just get him off the grounds.
- All right, Father. Come on.

132
00:19:35,856 --> 00:19:37,915
Father.

133
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:40,518
Thank you.

134
00:20:37,618 --> 00:20:39,711
Come in.

135
00:20:40,387 --> 00:20:43,720
Excuse me. Mrs Baylock is here.

136
00:20:45,092 --> 00:20:47,583
She says she's the new governess.

137
00:20:47,695 --> 00:20:50,596
Well, that's a start. Show her in.

138
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:54,092
Come in, please.

139
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:58,132
- Ambassador and Mrs Thorn.
- How do you do?

140
00:20:58,205 --> 00:21:03,575
I know it's a difficult time for you,
so I'll not intrude on your grief.

141
00:21:03,644 --> 00:21:07,740
I'm here to take away
some of your troubles and anxieties.

142
00:21:07,815 --> 00:21:11,376
We'll soon help your little boy
to forget what's happened.

143
00:21:11,452 --> 00:21:14,421
I'm afraid, sir,
that some of our young nannies,

144
00:21:14,522 --> 00:21:18,356
they get homesick,
or they have boyfriend problems.

145
00:21:19,426 --> 00:21:23,157
I left all that behind a long time ago.

146
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:27,030
Well, now, if you'll let me see your boy?

147
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:32,469
Yes, of course. He's upstairs.
I'll show you where it is.

148
00:21:32,573 --> 00:21:37,806
Why don't you just leave us alone at first?
Let us get acquainted in our own way.

149
00:21:37,878 --> 00:21:42,247
- Well, he's shy with new people.
- Oh, no. Not with me, he won't be.

150
00:21:44,485 --> 00:21:47,545
- Well, I don't think...
- I think it'll be fine.

151
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:50,283
Go on. Give it a try.

152
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:53,987
All right, then.

153
00:21:54,061 --> 00:21:56,655
- Mrs Horton.
- This way, Mrs Baylock.

154
00:21:56,764 --> 00:21:58,823
Excuse me.

155
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,874
- I like her.
- She seems all right.

156
00:22:08,976 --> 00:22:11,035
Where'd you find her?

157
00:22:12,012 --> 00:22:14,071
- Where did I find her?
- Yeah.

158
00:22:14,181 --> 00:22:17,673
I didn't find her. I assumed you found her.

159
00:22:20,821 --> 00:22:24,257
Round that corner to the right
and it's the door facing you.

160
00:22:24,325 --> 00:22:28,489
- I'll have your things sent up in a moment.
- Thank you.

161
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:33,931
- Mrs Baylock.
- Yes, ma'am?

162
00:22:34,034 --> 00:22:37,834
I'm sorry, but we're a little bit confused.

163
00:22:37,905 --> 00:22:39,998
Oh? Why's that?

164
00:22:40,074 --> 00:22:44,511
- Well, we don't know how you got here.
- The agency.

165
00:22:45,512 --> 00:22:50,211
- The agency?
- Well, yes. They read in the paper about the...

166
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:55,655
well, about your first nanny,
so they sent you another.

167
00:22:56,624 --> 00:22:59,889
- That's it.
- I'll call to confirm that.

168
00:23:02,863 --> 00:23:06,526
- Here are my references.
- Thank you very much.

169
00:23:07,968 --> 00:23:12,837
Well, if I could see your boy, now?

170
00:23:13,107 --> 00:23:15,632
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

171
00:23:39,366 --> 00:23:41,527
Have no fear, little one.

172
00:23:44,305 --> 00:23:46,796
I am here to protect thee.

173
00:24:01,088 --> 00:24:04,546
- In a minute, Horton, I think.
- Very good, sir.

174
00:24:10,164 --> 00:24:13,292
- Kathy.
- I'm coming. Mrs Baylock.

175
00:24:16,603 --> 00:24:18,764
- Mrs Baylock.
- Yes, ma'am?

176
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:21,205
- Where's Damien?
- If you don't mind,

177
00:24:21,308 --> 00:24:23,742
I think he'd rather go to the park.

178
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:27,611
- The park? I told you he was going with us.
- He's too young for church.

179
00:24:27,715 --> 00:24:31,173
- He'll cause a fuss.
- You don't seem to understand.

180
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:35,711
It is my wish and my husband's wish
that Damien accompanies us to church.

181
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:38,815
- Kathy.
- I'll be there in a minute.

182
00:24:38,992 --> 00:24:42,393
Now, please have him dressed at once.

183
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:45,987
Well, excuse me
for speaking my mind, ma'am,

184
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:48,660
but do you really think a five-year-old

185
00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:53,797
will understand the goings-on
of an Episcopal wedding?

186
00:24:53,874 --> 00:24:59,574
Will you have my son dressed and in the car
in five minutes? Thank you very much.

187
00:25:57,104 --> 00:25:59,664
What's the matter, Damien?

188
00:26:02,109 --> 00:26:04,839
It's just a church, that's all.

189
00:26:05,913 --> 00:26:08,404
What's the matter?

190
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:11,442
- Robert.
- Something wrong?

191
00:26:11,518 --> 00:26:15,750
- I don't know. He just seems scared to death.
- Is he ill?

192
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:19,953
No, he's just...

193
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,858
No, he's just trembling all over.

194
00:26:44,318 --> 00:26:47,685
- Mr Ambassador. Welcome, sir.
- Good morning.

195
00:26:48,055 --> 00:26:50,546
- No!
- Damien.

196
00:26:57,865 --> 00:27:00,129
Damien, stop it.

197
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,862
Damien, stop it. Damien.

198
00:27:02,936 --> 00:27:04,961
No!

199
00:27:05,305 --> 00:27:07,364
Horton, drive on.

200
00:27:23,023 --> 00:27:26,891
Are you sure that
you don't wanna call a doctor?

201
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,760
No, it's just a couple of bruises.
It'll be all right in the morning.

202
00:27:30,831 --> 00:27:33,527
No, I mean for Damien.

203
00:27:34,935 --> 00:27:39,372
Oh, no, he's fine. He's sound asleep.

204
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:42,567
Just to have him examine him.

205
00:27:44,144 --> 00:27:48,547
Well, he's perfectly all right.
Never been sick a day in his life.

206
00:27:48,615 --> 00:27:53,609
He never has, has he?
Isn't that a little strange?

207
00:27:55,255 --> 00:27:57,223
Is it?

208
00:27:57,324 --> 00:28:00,760
I mean, no measles or mumps or chickenpox.

209
00:28:00,827 --> 00:28:04,194
- Not even a cough or a cold.
- So?

210
00:28:06,633 --> 00:28:09,761
I just think it's a little unusual.

211
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:13,740
Look, he's a perfectly healthy boy.

212
00:28:14,374 --> 00:28:20,472
I mean, we have nothing to worry about
with him. Not physically or otherwise.

213
00:28:25,085 --> 00:28:28,885
He just had a bad moment.

214
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,381
You know, like a fright.

215
00:28:43,203 --> 00:28:45,569
Yes?

216
00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:50,804
- I'm leavin' now. Is there anything else?
- Nothing, thank you. Good night.

217
00:28:51,511 --> 00:28:56,813
I think the best thing to do with a bad day
like this is end it. I'm gonna go to bed.

218
00:28:56,883 --> 00:28:59,283
I'll be along soon.

219
00:29:36,089 --> 00:29:40,150
Quiet, now. This is the master of the house.

220
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,023
- What is this?
- Sir?

221
00:29:42,095 --> 00:29:44,427
The dog.

222
00:29:44,498 --> 00:29:49,834
- Beautiful, isn't he? We found him outside.
- Who gave you permission to bring it in?

223
00:29:50,037 --> 00:29:54,303
I thought we could use a good watchdog, sir.
And Damien loves him.

224
00:29:56,643 --> 00:29:59,339
Gave you a fright, did he, sir?

225
00:30:00,313 --> 00:30:03,180
- Yes.
- Well, you see how good he is.

226
00:30:03,283 --> 00:30:09,085
As a watchdog, I mean. I think you'll be
grateful on your long trips away, sir.

227
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,397
Mrs Baylock, we don't need a dog,

228
00:30:18,498 --> 00:30:21,467
and if we do, I'll pick him out myself.

229
00:30:22,602 --> 00:30:27,733
- Damien's taken quite a fancy to him, sir.
- Tomorrow morning you'll call the RSPCA,

230
00:30:27,874 --> 00:30:32,334
tell them to collect the dog
and find him another home.

231
00:30:32,412 --> 00:30:34,505
You understand?

232
00:30:35,782 --> 00:30:37,909
Sir.

233
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,581
Come on, boy.

234
00:31:14,654 --> 00:31:18,249
<i>Welcome to Windsor Safari Park.</i>

235
00:31:18,358 --> 00:31:21,191
<i>Animal compound to your left.</i>

236
00:31:21,261 --> 00:31:25,527
<i>Parking, for refreshment and zoo area,
to your right.</i>

237
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:31,731
<i>When driving through animal compounds,
please keep all car windows closed.</i>

238
00:31:36,243 --> 00:31:38,336
Thank you.

239
00:31:50,423 --> 00:31:52,482
Thank you.

240
00:32:26,026 --> 00:32:29,655
Come on, darling.
Let's go see the monkeys, OK?

241
00:32:36,002 --> 00:32:39,267
- Good morning, Horton.
- Good morning, sir.

242
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:21,371
<i>Baboons bite. Keep all car windows closed.</i>

243
00:33:22,849 --> 00:33:25,249
<i>Keep all car windows closed.</i>

244
00:33:26,186 --> 00:33:28,677
<i>Baboons are dangerous.</i>

245
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:16,167
Oh, no.

246
00:34:55,642 --> 00:34:57,735
- All right, Kathy?
- Yeah.

247
00:35:00,413 --> 00:35:03,280
You're so silent this evening.

248
00:35:03,883 --> 00:35:06,613
Just tired, I guess. Sorry.

249
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:09,482
- Damien all right?
- Yeah.

250
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:11,648
- You sure?
- Yes.

251
00:35:17,864 --> 00:35:24,394
If there were anything wrong,
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

252
00:35:24,471 --> 00:35:30,876
Wrong? What could be wrong with our child,
Robert? We're beautiful people, aren't we?

253
00:35:30,977 --> 00:35:34,174
There is something wrong, isn't there?

254
00:35:36,983 --> 00:35:39,281
Kathy.

255
00:35:39,386 --> 00:35:41,445
Is it so serious?

256
00:35:42,222 --> 00:35:45,055
Robert, I want...

257
00:35:45,191 --> 00:35:49,924
I need to see a psychiatrist. I have fears.

258
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,396
I have such fears.

259
00:35:52,465 --> 00:35:55,662
What kind of fears? What kind?

260
00:35:55,735 --> 00:35:58,533
If I told you, you'd put me away.

261
00:35:58,638 --> 00:36:02,472
Kathy, I love you. I love you.

262
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:05,477
Then help me. Find me a doctor.

263
00:36:05,545 --> 00:36:08,275
I will. Of course I will.

264
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:24,261
Keep that scrum tight.
Get down low. Come on.

265
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:28,926
Let it go. Let it go.

266
00:36:49,489 --> 00:36:51,980
Bring him down.

267
00:36:52,092 --> 00:36:54,185
Well done.

268
00:36:54,294 --> 00:36:57,525
I don't know what you're clapping for.
You just lost a bet.

269
00:36:57,597 --> 00:37:01,727
- That's right. 27-3?
- Right. That'll be three quid.

270
00:37:01,801 --> 00:37:05,601
- I thought it was two.
- Inflation. Haven't you heard, old boy?

271
00:37:05,705 --> 00:37:07,935
Well done, George. Great stuff.

272
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:10,498
It was a good game.

273
00:37:10,577 --> 00:37:12,704
Go and have a quick drink with the lads.

274
00:37:12,779 --> 00:37:16,306
That'll give me time
to make sure everything's set up.

275
00:37:16,382 --> 00:37:21,513
Tomorrow, half past two, Bishop's Park.
Five minutes and you'll never see me again.

276
00:37:21,588 --> 00:37:25,490
Your wife is in danger.
She'll die unless you come.

277
00:37:45,945 --> 00:37:48,004
Father.

278
00:37:48,848 --> 00:37:50,941
Thanks again.

279
00:39:29,882 --> 00:39:33,010
Get on with it. Say what you have to say.

280
00:39:35,021 --> 00:39:40,926
"When the Jews return to Zion,
and a comet rips the sky,

281
00:39:41,027 --> 00:39:46,863
and the Holy Roman Empire rises,
then you and I must die."

282
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:52,301
"From the eternal sea he rises,
creating armies on either shore,

283
00:39:52,438 --> 00:39:58,172
turning man against his brother,
till man exists no more."

284
00:39:59,379 --> 00:40:03,475
- The Book of Revelations predicted it all.
- I'm not here to listen to a sermon.

285
00:40:03,549 --> 00:40:07,246
"It is by means of a human personality
entirely in his possession

286
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,721
that Satan will wage
his last and formidable offense."

287
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:14,385
- You said that my wife...
- Go to the town of Megiddo

288
00:40:14,494 --> 00:40:16,962
in the old city of Jezreel.

289
00:40:17,797 --> 00:40:20,766
There, see the old man Bugenhagen.

290
00:40:22,135 --> 00:40:25,662
- He alone can say how the child must die.
- Look here...

291
00:40:25,738 --> 00:40:28,206
"He who will not be saved by the lamb
will be torn by the beast."

292
00:40:28,308 --> 00:40:30,299
Will you stop?

293
00:40:36,749 --> 00:40:41,413
I'm here because you said
my wife is in danger.

294
00:40:43,489 --> 00:40:45,923
She is pregnant.

295
00:40:45,992 --> 00:40:51,328
- You're mistaken. That's nonsense.
- He will not allow the child to be born.

296
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:55,424
- He will kill it while it slumbers in the womb.
- What are you talking about?

297
00:40:55,535 --> 00:40:57,901
Your son, Mr Thorn.

298
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:00,495
The son of the devil.

299
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:05,304
He will kill the unborn child,
then he will kill your wife,

300
00:41:06,646 --> 00:41:11,948
and when he is certain to inherit all that
is yours, then, Mr Thorn, he will kill you.

301
00:41:12,018 --> 00:41:13,110
That's enough!

302
00:41:13,186 --> 00:41:16,815
With your power, he will establish
his counterfeit kingdom here,

303
00:41:16,923 --> 00:41:19,721
receiving his power directly from Satan.

304
00:41:20,827 --> 00:41:23,819
- You're insane.
- He must die, Mr Thorn.

305
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:27,263
You asked for five minutes,
and you've got five minutes.

306
00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:32,134
Go to the city of Megiddo.
See Bugenhagen before it's too late.

307
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,999
Now, I've heard you.

308
00:41:36,075 --> 00:41:38,873
I want you to hear me.

309
00:41:38,978 --> 00:41:42,004
I never want to see you again.

310
00:41:45,184 --> 00:41:48,278
You'll see me in hell, Mr Thorn.

311
00:41:49,155 --> 00:41:52,283
There will we share out our sentence.

312
00:44:36,822 --> 00:44:39,120
No!

313
00:44:57,577 --> 00:44:59,670
Mrs Baylock.

314
00:45:01,747 --> 00:45:05,683
- Anything wrong?
- I just can't stand that noise.

315
00:45:07,153 --> 00:45:09,678
It's not all that bad.

316
00:45:09,789 --> 00:45:12,417
- Good morning, Damien.
- Good morning, Daddy.

317
00:45:12,491 --> 00:45:14,982
- What are we gonna do?
- Hold my hands.

318
00:45:15,061 --> 00:45:17,256
- Right.
- Mrs Baylock.

319
00:45:17,363 --> 00:45:19,422
Yes, ma'am?

320
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:23,298
- Would you take him out of here, please?
- He's only playing.

321
00:45:23,402 --> 00:45:26,269
Would you just get him out of here, please?

322
00:45:28,474 --> 00:45:30,567
Yes, ma'am.

323
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,315
Come along, Damien. Excuse me, sir.

324
00:45:47,727 --> 00:45:49,820
Come along.

325
00:45:55,001 --> 00:45:58,437
Darling, I don't know
what's the matter with me. I just...

326
00:45:58,504 --> 00:46:01,530
I just don't seem to be able to...

327
00:46:01,641 --> 00:46:04,132
I don't know.

328
00:46:18,424 --> 00:46:20,483
Kathy, I love you.

329
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,921
If this is what the doctor's doing to you,

330
00:46:25,031 --> 00:46:28,467
don't you think it's time
I had a talk with him?

331
00:46:28,534 --> 00:46:30,627
Yes, you should.

332
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:34,564
There's something
he wants to talk to you about, anyway.

333
00:46:34,674 --> 00:46:36,767
Oh?

334
00:46:37,777 --> 00:46:41,873
Robert, I don't ever
want to have any more children.

335
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,979
All right.

336
00:46:52,692 --> 00:46:55,490
Then you'll agree to an abortion?

337
00:46:58,497 --> 00:47:02,331
I'm pregnant, Robert.
I just found out this morning.

338
00:47:23,956 --> 00:47:26,220
Yes?

339
00:47:26,325 --> 00:47:28,418
Yes, this is he.

340
00:47:28,527 --> 00:47:30,222
Who?

341
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:32,388
Who? But...

342
00:47:34,567 --> 00:47:36,034
Hello?

343
00:47:36,635 --> 00:47:38,728
Hello?

344
00:47:43,109 --> 00:47:45,907
Something about the newspapers.

345
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,524
Well, she knew how much you wanted one.

346
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:09,398
Now she can't cope. She searches for reasons
that won't make her feel inadequate.

347
00:48:09,468 --> 00:48:12,130
She has these fantasies.

348
00:48:12,204 --> 00:48:17,972
She fantasises that your child is alien
and that your child is evil.

349
00:48:18,043 --> 00:48:20,739
She thinks that the child is evil?

350
00:48:20,846 --> 00:48:25,283
The point is, at this time,
another child would be disastrous.

351
00:48:27,853 --> 00:48:30,219
Well, in what way evil?

352
00:48:30,289 --> 00:48:35,056
Now, this is just fantasy.
She also thinks the child isn't hers.

353
00:48:50,209 --> 00:48:53,645
The most important thing for you to do
is to agree to an abortion.

354
00:48:53,712 --> 00:48:55,805
No.

355
00:48:57,516 --> 00:49:00,246
I'd like to know your reason.

356
00:49:04,056 --> 00:49:10,120
It was foretold that
this pregnancy would be terminated.

357
00:49:10,229 --> 00:49:13,323
I'm going to fight to see that it's not.

358
00:49:20,706 --> 00:49:23,106
- Forgive me, Doctor.
- Please don't leave.

359
00:49:23,209 --> 00:49:25,677
I'm sorry. I must get home.

360
00:51:12,117 --> 00:51:13,846
Damien.

361
00:51:16,255 --> 00:51:18,655
No, no, no, no!

362
00:51:18,857 --> 00:51:20,722
No! No!

363
00:52:00,693 --> 00:52:04,185
Are there any developments
on the state of your wife, sir?

364
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:10,799
- How is your wife, Mr Ambassador?
- Is there any news, sir?

365
00:52:14,707 --> 00:52:16,800
- Ambassador Thorn?
- Yes. Doctor?

366
00:52:16,876 --> 00:52:19,208
My name is Becker.

367
00:52:19,278 --> 00:52:22,008
Is she all right?

368
00:52:22,114 --> 00:52:24,446
Well, she will recover.

369
00:52:24,517 --> 00:52:27,611
She's in there. Bed by the window.

370
00:52:33,225 --> 00:52:36,490
She has a concussion
and a broken humerus,

371
00:52:36,595 --> 00:52:39,826
and, well, some internal bleeding.

372
00:52:44,103 --> 00:52:46,799
- Internal bleeding?
- Yes.

373
00:52:48,808 --> 00:52:51,402
But she's pregnant.

374
00:52:51,477 --> 00:52:52,944
No.

375
00:52:55,347 --> 00:52:58,282
- She's lost it?
- Afraid so.

376
00:53:05,725 --> 00:53:11,493
You know, you've got a lot to be grateful for.
She's still alive.

377
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:15,660
And, with proper care,
she can still have children.

378
00:54:03,816 --> 00:54:05,909
Robert.

379
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:09,378
Robert.

380
00:54:15,528 --> 00:54:18,224
Don't let him kill me.

381
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,730
Don't let him kill me.

382
00:54:30,342 --> 00:54:31,775
Kathy.

383
00:54:50,129 --> 00:54:52,222
It's all right.

384
00:56:45,144 --> 00:56:49,774
<i>- Yes?
- I'm sorry to bother you, Ambassador Thorn.</i>

385
00:56:49,882 --> 00:56:53,374
- Who is this?
- My name is Keith Jennings, sir.

386
00:56:53,485 --> 00:56:55,783
The photographer
whose camera got smashed.

387
00:56:55,888 --> 00:56:58,686
Would it be possible
to have a word with you at my flat?

388
00:56:58,757 --> 00:57:03,592
- If it's about the camera...
- No, it's not about the camera.

389
00:57:03,696 --> 00:57:06,597
It's about you, Mr Thorn.

390
00:57:06,699 --> 00:57:09,497
And the death of the priest.

391
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:13,169
Go on.

392
00:57:19,278 --> 00:57:21,508
Do you notice anything unusual?

393
00:57:23,949 --> 00:57:25,541
No. Sorry.

394
00:57:26,585 --> 00:57:30,487
At first I thought
this was just a fault in the film.

395
00:57:34,927 --> 00:57:37,327
A strange coincidence.

396
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:47,165
Then it happened again.

397
00:57:47,973 --> 00:57:50,840
Interesting, don't you think?

398
00:57:52,244 --> 00:57:56,772
And this, I took on the day
that you were at the rugby match.

399
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:59,409
- Same thing?
- Only it's more pronounced

400
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:03,147
and it's actually
making contact with the body.

401
00:58:05,724 --> 00:58:09,057
The rest, of course - history.

402
00:58:09,161 --> 00:58:11,220
I can't explain it.

403
00:58:14,967 --> 00:58:21,600
That's why I started digging. The coroner's
report shows that he was riddled with cancer.

404
00:58:21,673 --> 00:58:25,871
High on morphine most of the time.
Injected himself two or three times a day.

405
00:58:25,978 --> 00:58:29,573
- He knew that he was dying?
- Apparently, yes.

406
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:35,547
He said that he wanted
to be forgiven by Christ.

407
00:58:37,256 --> 00:58:43,593
Externally, his body was normal, except for
one thing on the inside of his right thigh.

408
00:58:43,662 --> 00:58:46,495
- What is it?
- Three sixes.

409
00:58:48,033 --> 00:58:50,001
Six hundred and sixty-six.

410
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:55,840
- Concentration camp?
- That's what I thought.

411
00:58:55,908 --> 00:59:02,245
But the biopsy says it's a birthmark.
The best is yet to come.

412
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:15,655
Pages of the Bible. Thousands of 'em.

413
00:59:15,727 --> 00:59:19,686
Every inch of wall-space covered,
even the windows.

414
00:59:22,835 --> 00:59:25,998
He even needed to be close to his church.

415
00:59:30,676 --> 00:59:33,144
There are 47. I counted them.

416
00:59:34,046 --> 00:59:37,345
I think he was trying
to keep something out, don't you?

417
00:59:39,051 --> 00:59:45,115
The police thought he was insane. They let
me come here to see if I could find anything.

418
00:59:49,094 --> 00:59:53,053
The first item is a diary.

419
00:59:56,668 --> 00:59:58,863
It didn't say anything about him.

420
00:59:58,937 --> 01:00:02,634
It's about you. What time
you left the house, where you went,

421
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:07,338
what restaurants you had your lunch in,
what time your speaking engagements were.

422
01:00:07,446 --> 01:00:12,679
The last entry says that he was supposed to
have met you in Bishop's Park.

423
01:00:12,751 --> 01:00:15,549
And that was dated the day he died.

424
01:00:17,523 --> 01:00:23,655
The important items are here. If we're to get
to the bottom of this, we've got to start here.

425
01:00:25,364 --> 01:00:30,700
<i>This first clipping
is from the Astrologer's Monthly.</i>

426
01:00:30,769 --> 01:00:36,765
Reports an unusual phenomenon. A comet
changed its shape into a glowing star,

427
01:00:36,875 --> 01:00:39,571
like the star of Bethlehem 2,000 years ago.

428
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:45,139
This one was on the other side of the world,
the European continent, five years ago.

429
01:00:46,552 --> 01:00:49,988
6 June, to be exact.

430
01:00:50,088 --> 01:00:53,148
Does that date mean anything to you?

431
01:00:53,225 --> 01:00:55,159
Yes.

432
01:00:55,227 --> 01:00:58,594
Then you'll recollect this other clipping.

433
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:02,690
It's a birth announcement
from a Rome newspaper.

434
01:01:02,768 --> 01:01:06,169
Also dated 6 June, five years ago.

435
01:01:06,238 --> 01:01:08,832
The day your son was born.

436
01:01:08,941 --> 01:01:11,967
The sixth month, sixth day.

437
01:01:14,813 --> 01:01:17,509
Was your son born at 6am?

438
01:01:19,218 --> 01:01:24,713
Yes, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to work out
this birthmark. The three sixes.

439
01:01:28,594 --> 01:01:30,858
My son is dead.

440
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:37,532
I don't know whose son I'm raising.

441
01:01:40,272 --> 01:01:44,606
If you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to help you try and find out.

442
01:01:44,676 --> 01:01:48,203
No. It's my problem.

443
01:01:51,216 --> 01:01:54,652
No, sir, you're wrong. It's my problem too.

444
01:01:58,190 --> 01:02:02,820
When I came here with the police,
I took some photographs.

445
01:02:02,894 --> 01:02:07,490
I happened to catch sight
of my own reflection in that mirror.

446
01:02:22,047 --> 01:02:26,381
I know you must think I'm crazy,
but I'm so frightened.

447
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:31,855
Don't be afraid. You'll be all right here.
You'll be perfectly all right.

448
01:02:36,928 --> 01:02:39,021
Some all right!

449
01:02:40,032 --> 01:02:43,468
- What about Damien?
- I'll speak to Mrs Horton.

450
01:02:43,535 --> 01:02:46,265
She'll look after him.

451
01:02:51,877 --> 01:02:53,936
Mrs Horton?

452
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,684
- Mrs Baylock.
- Sir.

453
01:03:00,752 --> 01:03:03,448
- Where's Mrs Horton?
- Gone.

454
01:03:04,523 --> 01:03:08,015
- Gone out?
- No, they've gone. They just got up and went.

455
01:03:08,093 --> 01:03:12,496
They left an address for you
to send their last month's wages to.

456
01:03:12,564 --> 01:03:18,434
Well, didn't Mrs Horton say anything?
Didn't Horton leave any explanation?

457
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:21,700
No. But don't worry, sir. I can manage.

458
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:35,515
- I'll look into this when I get back.
- Just as you wish, sir.

459
01:03:35,587 --> 01:03:37,851
- And Mrs Baylock?
- Sir?

460
01:03:37,923 --> 01:03:41,654
Last night, I saw that dog in Damien's room.
I clearly told you...

461
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,719
He's gone now, sir.
They took him away this morning.

462
01:04:24,236 --> 01:04:25,567
No.

463
01:04:30,175 --> 01:04:33,110
This is the right address.

464
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:47,219
Apparently, there was a terrible fire
and the old hospital burned down.

465
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:53,962
Five years ago.

466
01:04:58,403 --> 01:05:00,462
OK.

467
01:05:11,149 --> 01:05:15,483
But surely the fire didn't destroy everything.
There must have been some records.

468
01:05:16,888 --> 01:05:20,483
I sorry. I think everything was destroyed.

469
01:05:20,592 --> 01:05:23,755
Isn't it possible
there were some papers stored elsewhere?

470
01:05:23,862 --> 01:05:26,160
- I do not know.
- Sister.

471
01:05:27,466 --> 01:05:30,060
This is most important to me.

472
01:05:30,168 --> 01:05:33,763
I adopted a child here.
I'm searching for some records of it...

473
01:05:33,872 --> 01:05:36,898
- There were no adoptions here.
- There was one.

474
01:05:37,008 --> 01:05:39,977
<i>- No, signore.
- It wasn't an actual adoption.</i>

475
01:05:40,111 --> 01:05:42,636
- You are mistake.
- Wait.

476
01:05:42,714 --> 01:05:47,583
Birth records.
If I gave you a date. An exact date.

477
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:51,588
It's no use. The fire started
in the hall of records in the basement.

478
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:54,591
All the paperwork was there.
Went up like a torch.

479
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:57,924
Shot up the stairwells.
The third floor became an inferno.

480
01:05:58,029 --> 01:06:01,863
- The third floor?
- The maternity wards. Nothing left but ashes.

481
01:06:01,933 --> 01:06:05,425
- You will excuse me?
- What about the staff?

482
01:06:05,504 --> 01:06:08,200
<i>- Surely some survived.
- Sל, some.</i>

483
01:06:08,273 --> 01:06:11,242
There was a tall man, a priest.

484
01:06:11,309 --> 01:06:14,107
Dark eyes. Piercing eyes.

485
01:06:16,715 --> 01:06:17,704
Yes.

486
01:06:17,816 --> 01:06:20,944
<i>- He was principale.
- Yes, he was in charge. Is he...</i>

487
01:06:21,052 --> 01:06:23,213
- Yes, he is alive.
- Is he here?

488
01:06:23,288 --> 01:06:24,482
- No.
- Where?

489
01:06:24,556 --> 01:06:28,424
<i>He's in a monastero in Frosinone.</i>

490
01:06:29,261 --> 01:06:33,027
Many were taken there. Many die.

491
01:06:33,098 --> 01:06:36,761
Perhaps he is die since,
but he lived through the fire.

492
01:06:37,335 --> 01:06:40,099
<i>I remember people say it was un miracolo.</i>

493
01:06:40,772 --> 01:06:42,899
Frosinone?

494
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:14,705
- Here we are.
- What is it?

495
01:07:14,773 --> 01:07:17,708
- "When the Jews return to Zion..."
- That's the poem.

496
01:07:17,776 --> 01:07:20,370
"When the Jews return to Zion..."

497
01:07:20,478 --> 01:07:23,538
And there was something about a comet.

498
01:07:23,615 --> 01:07:27,881
Yes, that's here too. "The shower of stars
and the rise of the Roman Empire."

499
01:07:27,986 --> 01:07:32,423
These are supposed to be the events
that signal the birth of the Antichrist.

500
01:07:32,524 --> 01:07:34,583
The devil's child.

501
01:07:39,965 --> 01:07:45,767
It's making more sense. The Jews have
returned to Zion and there has been a comet.

502
01:07:45,837 --> 01:07:48,135
As for the rise of the Roman Empire,

503
01:07:48,206 --> 01:07:52,609
scholars think that could well mean
the Common Market, the Treaty of Rome.

504
01:07:52,711 --> 01:07:56,408
- Bit of a stretch.
- What about this? In Revelations it says:

505
01:07:56,514 --> 01:08:00,507
- "He shall rise from the eternal sea."
- That's the poem again.

506
01:08:00,585 --> 01:08:04,453
"From the eternal sea he rises,
creating armies on either shore."

507
01:08:04,556 --> 01:08:08,014
- That was the beginning of it.
- Theologians have interpreted

508
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:11,618
the "eternal sea"
as meaning the world of politics,

509
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:16,190
the sea that constantly rages
with turmoil and revolution.

510
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:22,065
So the devil's child will rise
from the world of politics.

511
01:08:43,495 --> 01:08:45,963
Looks like this is as far as we go.

512
01:08:46,064 --> 01:08:48,157
Let's have a look.

513
01:10:15,386 --> 01:10:17,479
Found him?

514
01:10:36,307 --> 01:10:41,074
His mind is active,
but since the fire he's not made a sound.

515
01:10:41,179 --> 01:10:43,704
We feed him and take care of his needs.

516
01:10:43,782 --> 01:10:47,343
And we pray for his recovery
when his penance is completed.

517
01:10:47,418 --> 01:10:48,908
What penance?

518
01:10:48,987 --> 01:10:51,922
"Woe to the shepherd
who abandons his sheep."

519
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:55,153
"May his right arm wither
and his right eye lose its sight."

520
01:10:55,226 --> 01:10:58,093
He's fallen from grace. Can you tell us why?

521
01:10:58,196 --> 01:11:00,289
For abandoning Christ.

522
01:11:00,365 --> 01:11:03,528
- How do you know he's abandoned Christ?
- He told us.

523
01:11:03,601 --> 01:11:07,628
- But he doesn't speak.
- There is some movement in his left hand.

524
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:10,435
He was able to write it down.

525
01:11:14,546 --> 01:11:17,515
You will notice the curved line over the head.

526
01:11:17,582 --> 01:11:21,609
This indicates the hood of the monk.
His own hood.

527
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:24,950
- The three sixes.
- Six is the sign of the devil.

528
01:11:25,023 --> 01:11:29,722
- But why three of them?
- We believe it signifies the diabolical trinity.

529
01:11:29,794 --> 01:11:35,630
- The devil, Antichrist and false prophet.
- Father, Son and Holy Ghost.

530
01:11:35,733 --> 01:11:41,797
For everything holy, there is something
unholy. This is the essence of temptation.

531
01:11:47,378 --> 01:11:50,870
Father Spiletto, my name is Thorn.

532
01:11:53,751 --> 01:11:57,744
There was a child.
I want to know where that child came from.

533
01:11:57,822 --> 01:12:02,259
- I am afraid that...
- You confessed to them. Now confess to me.

534
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:05,193
<i>- What happened?
- Please, signore.</i>

535
01:12:05,263 --> 01:12:08,790
You said you knew its mother.
Where is she now?

536
01:12:08,867 --> 01:12:13,998
- I must insist that you do not...
- I beg you, where is she?

537
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:17,606
Answer me.

538
01:12:17,809 --> 01:12:19,071
Answer.

539
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:33,281
Excuse me.

540
01:13:26,678 --> 01:13:28,737
Cervet.

541
01:13:31,649 --> 01:13:35,949
Please, does it mean something to you?

542
01:13:36,587 --> 01:13:38,851
Cerveteri.

543
01:13:38,923 --> 01:13:41,915
It is an old cemetery from Etruscan times.

544
01:13:41,993 --> 01:13:44,757
Cripta Sant'Angelo.

545
01:13:44,862 --> 01:13:49,322
- It is nothing but ruins.
- Where is this place?

546
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:52,995
- But there is nothing there. Only graves.
- Where is it?

547
01:13:54,405 --> 01:13:58,307
You will find it on the map.
It is perhaps 50km north of Rome.

548
01:17:10,401 --> 01:17:12,528
Robert, over here.

549
01:17:25,616 --> 01:17:28,141
Maria Scianna.

550
01:17:28,219 --> 01:17:30,312
My God.

551
01:17:31,722 --> 01:17:34,384
June 6.

552
01:17:36,727 --> 01:17:38,786
Five years ago.

553
01:17:40,631 --> 01:17:43,191
Bambino Scianna.

554
01:17:43,301 --> 01:17:45,792
Infant boy. Same date.

555
01:17:53,611 --> 01:17:57,945
"In birth and death,
the generations embrace."

556
01:18:02,753 --> 01:18:06,621
Is my son buried here?

557
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:13,758
This woman could be
the mother of the child you adopted.

558
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:18,763
Why here in this terrible place?

559
01:18:41,192 --> 01:18:43,820
- No.
- Oh, my God.

560
01:18:57,041 --> 01:19:00,306
- The other one.
- No. Let's get out of here.

561
01:19:01,812 --> 01:19:04,280
If it's an animal too,

562
01:19:05,249 --> 01:19:08,912
then maybe my child

563
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:14,015
is alive somewhere.

564
01:19:26,137 --> 01:19:28,469
They murdered him.

565
01:19:28,539 --> 01:19:32,100
They murdered him as soon as he was born.

566
01:19:35,946 --> 01:19:38,039
Murderers.

567
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:40,908
Murderers.

568
01:19:53,531 --> 01:19:55,658
Come on.

569
01:19:56,067 --> 01:19:58,535
Robert.

570
01:20:11,549 --> 01:20:15,076
Don't run. It's only the smell of the graves.

571
01:20:26,063 --> 01:20:28,054
Run.

572
01:20:29,333 --> 01:20:30,891
Robert.

573
01:22:39,630 --> 01:22:42,827
- Hello?
- Hello.

574
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:44,993
Kathy?

575
01:22:46,103 --> 01:22:49,937
<i>Hello, Robert. Is that you?
I'm so glad you called.</i>

576
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:55,501
Kathy, darling.
Now, listen to me very carefully.

577
01:22:55,613 --> 01:22:57,740
Do just what I say.

578
01:22:57,882 --> 01:23:01,249
I want you to leave London right now.

579
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:06,516
<i>- What do you mean, leave London, darling?
- I've put through a call to the embassy.</i>

580
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:11,857
Tom Portman will meet you at the hospital
and bring you here to Rome.

581
01:23:11,929 --> 01:23:15,729
<i>- Robert, what's happened? What's wrong?
- Please, darling. Just do it.</i>

582
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:18,334
<i>Get ready to leave.</i>

583
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:24,669
- Robert, I don't think I can move very well.
- Kathy, do it.

584
01:23:24,975 --> 01:23:30,311
OK. Yes, all right, I'll try to be ready
by the time he gets here.

585
01:23:30,381 --> 01:23:32,474
<i>All right, darling.</i>

586
01:24:11,589 --> 01:24:14,422
Who is that? Is that somebody there?

587
01:24:14,525 --> 01:24:17,016
Tom? Is that you?

588
01:25:11,615 --> 01:25:13,674
Yes?

589
01:25:14,551 --> 01:25:16,610
Yes, this is he.

590
01:25:20,057 --> 01:25:22,150
Tom?

591
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,859
Kathy?

592
01:25:38,976 --> 01:25:41,035
Tom,

593
01:25:42,212 --> 01:25:45,443
I can't talk now.

594
01:26:40,104 --> 01:26:42,163
Robert.

595
01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:46,034
I found out about the town of Megiddo.

596
01:26:49,179 --> 01:26:52,512
It's derived from the word "Armageddon".

597
01:26:54,118 --> 01:26:57,178
The end of the world.

598
01:26:57,287 --> 01:27:00,256
It's underground,
about 60 miles south of Jerusalem.

599
01:27:00,324 --> 01:27:03,555
There's some excavation going on there.

600
01:27:05,195 --> 01:27:08,926
If only you could remember the name
of the man you're supposed to see.

601
01:27:09,066 --> 01:27:11,125
It's Bugenhagen.

602
01:27:11,969 --> 01:27:14,733
He was an exorcist. I read about him.

603
01:27:15,405 --> 01:27:19,364
That was his name.
And I remember the poem.

604
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:22,908
"When the Jews return to Zion,

605
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:25,744
and a comet fills the sky

606
01:27:25,816 --> 01:27:29,343
and the Holy Roman Empire rises,

607
01:27:29,419 --> 01:27:31,910
then you and I must die."

608
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:37,753
"From the eternal sea he rises,

609
01:27:37,828 --> 01:27:40,820
creating armies on either shore

610
01:27:41,832 --> 01:27:44,995
turning man against his brother

611
01:27:46,770 --> 01:27:50,501
till man exists no more."

612
01:27:56,647 --> 01:27:59,172
Kathy is dead.

613
01:28:01,618 --> 01:28:04,348
I want Damien to die, too.

614
01:28:59,910 --> 01:29:02,378
Hello, Mr Thorn.

615
01:29:02,446 --> 01:29:04,914
I am Bugenhagen.

616
01:29:05,015 --> 01:29:08,974
- What is this place?
- The city of Jezreel.

617
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:12,888
Town of Megiddo.

618
01:29:13,690 --> 01:29:18,650
The place where Christianity began.

619
01:29:20,797 --> 01:29:24,460
The little priest - is he dead yet?

620
01:29:25,302 --> 01:29:27,202
Yes.

621
01:29:29,907 --> 01:29:32,000
Yes.

622
01:29:35,812 --> 01:29:39,714
Come along, Mr Thorn.
We had better get to work.

623
01:29:49,559 --> 01:29:52,050
You will excuse us.

624
01:29:52,963 --> 01:29:55,898
This is for Mr Thorn alone.

625
01:29:57,768 --> 01:29:59,861
All right.

626
01:30:53,991 --> 01:30:57,825
It must be done on hallowed ground.

627
01:30:59,763 --> 01:31:02,197
A church.

628
01:31:02,332 --> 01:31:05,927
His blood must be spilled on the altar of God.

629
01:31:09,439 --> 01:31:13,535
This first knife is most important.

630
01:31:15,912 --> 01:31:22,010
It extinguishes physical life
and forms the center of the cross.

631
01:31:24,054 --> 01:31:29,014
The subsequent placings
extinguish spiritual life

632
01:31:29,126 --> 01:31:32,527
and should radiate outward.

633
01:31:32,596 --> 01:31:34,655
Like this.

634
01:31:37,634 --> 01:31:43,630
This is not a human child. Make no mistake.

635
01:31:53,016 --> 01:31:55,746
- Is there proof?
- Oh, yes.

636
01:31:56,787 --> 01:31:59,221
He bears a birthmark.

637
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:02,990
A sequence of sixes.

638
01:32:03,493 --> 01:32:06,985
So, says the Bible,
do all the apostles of Satan.

639
01:32:08,799 --> 01:32:12,098
- He doesn't have it.
- He must have it.

640
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:16,171
I've bathed him. I know every inch of him.

641
01:32:17,474 --> 01:32:23,106
If it is not visible on the body,
it will be beneath the hair.

642
01:32:24,981 --> 01:32:27,643
Remove it.

643
01:32:28,185 --> 01:32:31,382
You must be devoid of pity.

644
01:32:33,990 --> 01:32:39,053
- And the woman?
- She is an apostate of hell.

645
01:32:39,129 --> 01:32:42,428
She will die before permitting this.

646
01:32:50,507 --> 01:32:56,468
Look, I want to know what he said.
I've a right to know.

647
01:32:56,646 --> 01:33:01,276
Robert, I want to know what he said.
Look, I'm notjust some bystander.

648
01:33:01,418 --> 01:33:05,445
- I was the one that found him.
- I'm the one that's supposed to kill him.

649
01:33:05,522 --> 01:33:09,458
These are knives. He wants me to stab him.

650
01:33:09,526 --> 01:33:12,654
- Wants me to murder a child.
- It's not a child.

651
01:33:12,729 --> 01:33:15,527
How can he know that? Maybe he's wrong.

652
01:33:15,632 --> 01:33:20,831
It's insane. I won't have anything
to do with murdering a little boy.

653
01:33:20,904 --> 01:33:23,873
He's not responsible. I won't do it.

654
01:33:32,082 --> 01:33:34,915
Well, if you don't do it, I will.

655
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:13,540
No!

656
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:36,758
Run, Damien. Run. Run.

657
01:42:05,294 --> 01:42:07,387
No!

658
01:44:22,899 --> 01:44:23,957
Hold it.

659
01:44:27,503 --> 01:44:31,496
<i>- Panda Four to control.
- MP to Panda Four, come in, please.</i>

660
01:44:31,574 --> 01:44:36,534
Panda Four in pursuit.
American Ambassador, white estate car.

661
01:44:36,612 --> 01:44:39,604
Heading north. Seven Hills Road. Over.

662
01:44:45,221 --> 01:44:47,655
Al. We've got a shout.

663
01:44:47,757 --> 01:44:49,816
I'll be back later, all right?

664
01:44:52,128 --> 01:44:55,461
<i>MP to Zulu Seven.
You are requested assist Panda Four</i>

665
01:44:55,565 --> 01:44:58,659
<i>in pursuit of white estate car,
north Seven Hills Road.</i>

666
01:44:58,768 --> 01:45:00,759
<i>Possible diplomatic incident.</i>

667
01:45:06,475 --> 01:45:11,378
<i>Zulu Seven to Panda Four.
We have taken over your pursuit. Over.</i>

668
01:45:24,994 --> 01:45:29,226
<i>Zulu Seven to MP.
Heading west on Old Church Road.</i>

669
01:46:21,083 --> 01:46:24,052
No! Please, Daddy, no!

670
01:46:24,620 --> 01:46:28,454
- No, Daddy. No!
- God help me.

671
01:46:28,858 --> 01:46:32,089
Police! Drop. Drop, or I'll fire.

672
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:51,041
And so to their final rest do we commit
these two and entrust them unto our Lord.

673
01:46:52,481 --> 01:46:57,578
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

674
01:46:58,387 --> 01:47:00,480
Detail, attention.

675
01:47:01,524 --> 01:47:03,583
Present arms.

676
01:47:07,496 --> 01:47:10,090
Ready, aim, fire.

677
01:47:11,968 --> 01:47:14,334
Ready, aim, fire.

678
01:47:16,372 --> 01:47:18,772
Ready, aim, fire.

679
01:48:15,398 --> 01:48:19,960
Excuse me, Mr President. When you're ready
to leave, your car is over there.

680
01:48:20,036 --> 01:48:22,368
- In a moment.
- Yes, sir.
