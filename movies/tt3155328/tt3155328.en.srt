00:00:19,705 --> 00:00:22,374
Cubs parking!
Easy entry and exit!

3
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:23,834
How is it going?

4
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:24,918
Forty.

5
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:28,046
"Here, sir."
- Easy money.

6
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,174
Money comes in every day.

7
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:34,928
Cubs parking!

8
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,096
Hey, Ronnie!

9
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:42,936
When I come back?

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,772
I will call you. I'll let you know.

11
00:00:44,855 --> 00:00:45,856
- Good.
- Thank you.

12
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:47,524
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

13
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:15,886
A lot of people today? Yes.

14
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:17,595
It was good?

15
00:01:21,224 --> 00:01:23,226
- Let's say $ 60.
- All right.

16
00:01:45,665 --> 00:01:46,709
Double! Yes.

17
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:50,879
Kings and sevens. Kings and sevens win.

18
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:52,923
- Very good hand.
- Thank you gentlemen.

19
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:55,467
- You play to win.
- Yes, well ordered.

20
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,594
He asked for three letters.

21
00:01:59,262 --> 00:02:01,431
Here the new hand begins.

22
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:03,641
I did not see him coming.

23
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:08,355
Well, it's $ 25 per head.

24
00:02:11,024 --> 00:02:12,025
Thank you.

25
00:02:13,485 --> 00:02:15,362
Fifteen. It happened.

26
00:02:18,198 --> 00:02:21,409
- That's twenty.
- It's okay.

27
00:02:23,245 --> 00:02:25,038
Good morning, Eddie. Bad night?

28
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:02,325
- How are you?
- Fine and you?

29
00:03:02,575 --> 00:03:03,994
- All right.
- I'm glad.

30
00:03:04,912 --> 00:03:05,912
All good?

31
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,540
Yes, all right. What happened?

32
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:11,376
Nothing. I can not pay you now.

33
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,086
- It's not enough.
- Wait. Hears.

34
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,171
- Do not!
- I know.

35
00:03:14,254 --> 00:03:16,298
- Stop. Every day...
- Adrian, Mira.

36
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:18,008
No, that's enough.

37
00:03:18,091 --> 00:03:19,176
Adrian, please.

38
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:21,719
- I was making $ 200.
- Do not.

39
00:03:21,804 --> 00:03:23,430
- Enough, Victor.
- Yes please.

40
00:03:23,513 --> 00:03:24,514
Do not.

41
00:03:24,597 --> 00:03:25,974
I'll do? Do not pay you.

42
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:27,893
- I am sorry.
- Good.

43
00:03:28,726 --> 00:03:30,687
I will starve.

44
00:03:31,604 --> 00:03:33,857
- I do not care.
- How come? If you care.

45
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:35,108
- Do not.
- Do you mind.

46
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:36,392
- No, not anymore.
- All right.

47
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,320
I'll pay you by the end of the week.
Guaranteed.

48
00:03:38,403 --> 00:03:40,238
- Stop it, Victor!
- I'll pay you.

49
00:03:40,322 --> 00:03:41,907
- Yes please.
- Victor!

50
00:03:44,034 --> 00:03:45,243
Cone!

51
00:04:00,175 --> 00:04:01,676
Very good.

52
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:11,686
Good heavens!

53
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:13,688
- I scared you?
- What are you doing here?

54
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:16,411
- Forgives. I did not want to scare you.
- What are you doing here?

55
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:18,986
I came to say hello.
You were not home and I went in.

56
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:20,528
I do not owe you anything.

57
00:04:20,612 --> 00:04:22,530
- Not a penny.
- Who said yes?

58
00:04:22,614 --> 00:04:23,991
You owe me nothing.

59
00:04:24,074 --> 00:04:25,909
Come on. Enter the dining room.

60
00:04:26,743 --> 00:04:27,911
Come with me.

61
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:31,664
- How are you?
- A little scared, but good.

62
00:04:32,665 --> 00:04:33,708
What was there?

63
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:35,335
I have a business proposal.

64
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:37,087
- I hear you.
- Very good.

65
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,507
I will be away for a while.
I'm sent to prison.

66
00:04:42,384 --> 00:04:43,635
While not,

67
00:04:45,053 --> 00:04:46,388
there is something here.

68
00:04:47,472 --> 00:04:48,849
I need you to save it.

69
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,810
I do not want the police to have it.

70
00:04:52,895 --> 00:04:55,772
Neither my friends nor
anyone, you understand?

71
00:04:55,856 --> 00:04:56,982
I understand.

72
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,984
I'll be out.

73
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:02,529
About six or nine months.
We do not know yet.

74
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:06,241
When you leave, you give me the bag.

75
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:08,869
And I give you $ 10,000 in cash.

76
00:05:08,952 --> 00:05:10,537
$ 10,000?

77
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,663
What's in the bag?

78
00:05:11,746 --> 00:05:13,456
Do not worry about it.

79
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,419
Do not open it. Do not look at her. Do not
touch her. Do not even think about Ella.

80
00:05:17,502 --> 00:05:20,047
Hide it and forget it. That is all.

81
00:05:21,173 --> 00:05:24,676
Shit, Michael.
It's an interesting opportunity.

82
00:05:27,512 --> 00:05:28,805
One could say, yes.

83
00:05:31,558 --> 00:05:32,684
Yes?

84
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:34,352
- Done deal.
- Very good.

85
00:05:34,436 --> 00:05:35,437
- Done.
- Done.

86
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,855
- All right. Ray!
- I'm your man.

87
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:42,527
<i>Eddie, it's Ron.</i>

88
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,946
<i>I do not know if you remember me.</i>

89
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:46,239
<i>I left your mother's
vagina before you.</i>

90
00:05:46,323 --> 00:05:48,908
<i>We grew up together. I am your brother.</i>

91
00:05:48,992 --> 00:05:51,869
<i>Hi. Where are you?</i>

92
00:05:51,954 --> 00:05:54,706
<i>We have not seen you in weeks,
and we'd like to see you.</i>

93
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:57,000
<i>We miss you. Your nephew misses you.</i>

94
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,502
<i>Call us. Let's dine together. Bye.</i>

95
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,421
Hi.

96
00:06:01,504 --> 00:06:03,756
Do what seems right to you.

97
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,924
Follow your instinct.

98
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:07,219
- Trust your instinct.
- It's a great decision.

99
00:06:07,302 --> 00:06:09,387
Very well, I will.

100
00:06:09,554 --> 00:06:12,390
Yes!

101
00:06:12,474 --> 00:06:13,850
- Special caramel!
- All right.

102
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,354
- Uncle Eddie...
- Nice to see you.

103
00:06:17,437 --> 00:06:18,855
How are you?

104
00:06:18,938 --> 00:06:20,440
Very good.

105
00:06:20,523 --> 00:06:21,608
Yes? Yes.

106
00:06:21,691 --> 00:06:23,110
What have you done lately?

107
00:06:23,193 --> 00:06:25,612
Work, have fun, save and...

108
00:06:25,695 --> 00:06:27,447
Do not you park cars?

109
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,117
Are you parking cars? Yes.

110
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,243
- Not every day.
- Look!

111
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:34,746
Last season you said
it would be the last.

112
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:38,500
But this year the cubs
are doing very well.

113
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,086
People want to go and see them.
There are more opportunities.

114
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:43,713
And I do not reject the
money, so I accepted the job.

115
00:06:43,796 --> 00:06:46,258
- In fact...
- Were you working...?

116
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:48,221
Were not you going to
open a restaurant or bar?

117
00:06:48,245 --> 00:06:51,554
Arthur and I were going
to open a private bar.

118
00:06:51,638 --> 00:06:55,308
We are still talking about it.

119
00:06:56,351 --> 00:06:58,353
- Follow.
- We care about your career.

120
00:06:58,436 --> 00:07:00,355
That you can keep
it economically.

121
00:07:00,438 --> 00:07:02,149
I know. Actually...

122
00:07:02,232 --> 00:07:04,442
I started a business. Thanks for asking.

123
00:07:04,526 --> 00:07:07,487
- You started a business?
- A storage business.

124
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,696
Storage?

125
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,448
Yes, I started... I already have...

126
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:12,450
It is not an idea. It is real.
I have a client.

127
00:07:12,534 --> 00:07:13,618
- Look!
- What?

128
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:14,827
What do you say?

129
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:19,332
I have a client who
paid me for six months.

130
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,751
I'm looking for more customers.

131
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:22,914
What are you talking about?

132
00:07:22,938 --> 00:07:24,421
- It's strange.
- What is strange?

133
00:07:24,504 --> 00:07:26,173
- Help me.
- I need a job.

134
00:07:26,256 --> 00:07:27,382
Help me with the trash.

135
00:07:27,465 --> 00:07:29,217
I did not come to talk about it.

136
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:30,343
Good...

137
00:07:30,427 --> 00:07:32,387
- I came to be with you.
- Very good.

138
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,471
Do not get mad.

139
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:34,764
- No but...
- Look.

140
00:07:34,847 --> 00:07:36,641
Do not let it affect you. He loves you.

141
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:38,810
And I her. You know that.

142
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:39,977
I know you know it.

143
00:07:40,062 --> 00:07:42,064
Yes, but almost... you know?

144
00:07:42,147 --> 00:07:44,399
I know. We care about you.

145
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:46,609
A lot.

146
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:51,198
At some point you will have to mature.

147
00:07:51,281 --> 00:07:53,533
And act as an adult.
I'm serious.

148
00:07:53,616 --> 00:07:55,493
You will not be able to
continue at this rate.

149
00:07:56,411 --> 00:07:57,454
Listen to me.

150
00:07:57,537 --> 00:07:59,747
I know I repeat myself.
Come and work for me.

151
00:08:00,373 --> 00:08:03,918
Please. He would have loved to
have his children work with him.

152
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:05,795
Come on. He would have loved it.

153
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:08,840
- I do not want...
- Security and stability.

154
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:11,676
You would have a salary.
You would spend money as you wanted.

155
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,098
- You would have a support.
- I will not work at the chip company.

156
00:08:16,181 --> 00:08:18,766
- You must build your life.
- Ron, shut up.

157
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,690
- It's great!
- I do not want to be a gardener.

158
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:22,248
I do not want to make a career there.

159
00:08:22,272 --> 00:08:24,897
What is wrong with the company?
They built it!

160
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:27,150
I love what dad did.

161
00:08:27,234 --> 00:08:29,861
It's not what I want. That is all.

162
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:33,323
You can not give me a
joint and then a sermon.

163
00:08:33,406 --> 00:08:35,326
- That's how you are.
- I do not smoke so much...

164
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:37,952
- "Stop!".
- Stop.

165
00:08:38,036 --> 00:08:41,498
"I can not smoke and think about my life."
Me drugs.

166
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:43,041
And now lecture me.

167
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:12,987
Shit.

168
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,616
Makes some delicious cookies.

169
00:09:38,305 --> 00:09:39,306
Do not.

170
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,935
Do not do it, idiot.

171
00:09:47,814 --> 00:09:48,898
Do not do it.

172
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:52,277
Do not get into this.

173
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:56,030
Do not do it.

174
00:09:57,365 --> 00:09:59,909
- Did Jake hear anything?
- No, I look at things.

175
00:09:59,992 --> 00:10:02,162
Bodybuilding and all that.

176
00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:03,705
- Oh, my god.
- Wow...

177
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:06,374
- I am sorry.
- It would have been the end.

178
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,625
It's a great story.

179
00:10:08,543 --> 00:10:10,920
It was not a story.
It really is.

180
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:12,964
What do we have here? A sandwich?

181
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:14,048
Twenty.

182
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:15,592
More a sandwich.

183
00:10:17,469 --> 00:10:19,596
I need to buy gas.

184
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,682
Good shot.

185
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:33,693
Do not do it.

186
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:37,237
Do not.

187
00:10:40,158 --> 00:10:41,158
Do not.

188
00:10:44,662 --> 00:10:45,830
Gross.

189
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:49,125
What's up?

190
00:11:06,726 --> 00:11:09,103
Shit.

191
00:11:10,313 --> 00:11:11,939
Do not.

192
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:14,692
Do not.

193
00:11:16,236 --> 00:11:17,612
Do not.

194
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,156
Do not.

195
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:25,662
What the fuck.

196
00:11:27,246 --> 00:11:28,998
Do not.

197
00:11:35,797 --> 00:11:37,256
This is not good.

198
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:41,260
It is not...

199
00:11:43,846 --> 00:11:45,097
Fuck.

200
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:49,477
Pancake house and restaurant.

201
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:52,647
The fact that you are
considering this plan.

202
00:11:53,481 --> 00:11:56,567
Means that in three weeks there
will be no money left in that bag.

203
00:11:56,651 --> 00:12:00,154
Is not true.
This is going to have a happy ending.

204
00:12:00,237 --> 00:12:01,948
There will be no happy ending.
Yes.

205
00:12:02,031 --> 00:12:03,825
You never have a happy ending.

206
00:12:03,908 --> 00:12:05,493
It's a loser attitude.

207
00:12:05,577 --> 00:12:08,371
Every story you've told
me since I met you.

208
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:11,290
It's about how you were
here and you ended up here.

209
00:12:11,374 --> 00:12:12,625
Because you're my best man.

210
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:14,461
Am I going to boast?

211
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:15,795
Most are victories.

212
00:12:15,878 --> 00:12:17,422
- Who's your godfather?
- Your.

213
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:19,233
I?

214
00:12:19,257 --> 00:12:20,300
Is not true.

215
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:22,093
- Yes.
- I'm not your godfather.

216
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:24,715
You have not been to a
meeting in six months.

217
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:26,889
Here is a system,
with concrete rules.

218
00:12:26,973 --> 00:12:28,558
I'll tell you who I am.

219
00:12:28,641 --> 00:12:30,768
I'm a guy you take to coffee shops.

220
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:33,270
Tell him the nonsense
you're going to do.

221
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:36,399
You expect me to accept them
so as not to feel guilty.

222
00:12:36,483 --> 00:12:37,609
My godfather.

223
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:40,194
Did you learn that in the program?
What I said...

224
00:12:40,277 --> 00:12:42,447
So you think he's a godfather?

225
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,533
I just want to get $ 500
off the bag and bet.

226
00:12:45,617 --> 00:12:47,243
As soon as he wins,

227
00:12:47,326 --> 00:12:51,373
I will return the $ 500 to
the bag and I will keep it.

228
00:12:51,456 --> 00:12:55,752
You are a loser. You never won.
You always lose.

229
00:12:55,835 --> 00:12:58,921
- A top-notch loser!
- Is not true.

230
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:03,134
That is what you are.
Pure flesh of a loser.

231
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:05,720
- You're not going to make any money!
- Maybe yes.

232
00:13:05,803 --> 00:13:06,971
- Do not...
- If I return it,

233
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:09,391
and is feasible, what is the problem?

234
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:11,350
If you get $ 500, you'll get another $ 500.

235
00:13:11,434 --> 00:13:13,686
- No. My limit...
- You will do it.

236
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,938
My limit is $ 500.
Then I do not touch it.

237
00:13:16,022 --> 00:13:19,358
90% of what you said since
we sat down is nonsense!

238
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:22,945
Gene, it's an opportunity
like I've never had.

239
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:24,989
I've never had so much cash.

240
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:28,493
The opportunity you have is to
leave the bag in the closet,

241
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:31,788
do not do shit.

242
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:35,166
And collect money at the end, without risk.

243
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:36,292
Do you see it?

244
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,670
- You see?
- Yeah, I'm glad I called you.

245
00:13:38,753 --> 00:13:40,505
I will not touch money.

246
00:13:40,588 --> 00:13:41,589
Will not you touch it?

247
00:13:41,673 --> 00:13:42,913
Thank you. I will not touch it.

248
00:13:42,965 --> 00:13:45,092
- Fabulous.
- It's over. I needed it.

249
00:13:45,176 --> 00:13:46,177
Thank you.

250
00:14:01,526 --> 00:14:04,028
It's okay. I see.

251
00:14:10,076 --> 00:14:12,745
Twenty one! Very good!

252
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:15,372
Nine.

253
00:14:20,878 --> 00:14:23,255
- Any beer.
- Right now.

254
00:14:45,277 --> 00:14:48,239
Yes!

255
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:49,824
I told you!

256
00:14:52,243 --> 00:14:53,536
All this is for you.

257
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,705
Leave it close. Immediately
i come for more.

258
00:14:55,788 --> 00:14:56,831
- Yes.
- Thank you, Paul.

259
00:15:04,547 --> 00:15:05,590
Yes sir!

260
00:15:05,673 --> 00:15:06,966
Let's drink! All night.

261
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:08,718
I invite. Yes.

262
00:15:09,802 --> 00:15:12,388
I was scared. He was terrified.

263
00:15:12,472 --> 00:15:15,391
But it was fixed.
I returned everything and won two.

264
00:15:15,475 --> 00:15:18,394
Now that I've won two, it's like...

265
00:15:19,145 --> 00:15:21,022
- I can jump.
- It's easy money.

266
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:21,981
Of course you can.

267
00:15:22,064 --> 00:15:24,150
If I lose, I will be the
same as when I started.

268
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:27,487
Let's celebrate. Thanks for coming.
I'm glad they left.

269
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:31,365
I needed this. It feels...

270
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:33,618
- You deserve it.
- I deserve it.

271
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:36,037
Thanks guys.
Take another. All night.

272
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,454
Tell them what I pay.

273
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:39,206
Paul, I paid tonight.

274
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,124
- Yes!
- Paul!

275
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:41,417
- A beer.
- Other?

276
00:15:41,501 --> 00:15:42,960
- Yes.
- A bag of cookies.

277
00:15:46,005 --> 00:15:47,840
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

278
00:15:51,761 --> 00:15:53,304
Forgives.

279
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:55,347
Agree. Sorry.

280
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:10,362
After you.

281
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:17,411
The location is the key.
My uncle has a place...

282
00:16:17,494 --> 00:16:21,248
Ahead. Call your uncle.
Tell him it's for real. We will do it.

283
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,755
- Hello.
- What's up?

284
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,675
Serve another round of
drinks to those ladies.

285
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:31,968
I invite.

286
00:16:32,051 --> 00:16:33,595
Your? That good. Yes.

287
00:16:33,678 --> 00:16:35,847
You have to go and take them.

288
00:16:36,764 --> 00:16:39,100
- I'm not at the tables.
- Do it for me.

289
00:16:39,183 --> 00:16:41,310
Do it. When they
ask from whom...

290
00:16:41,393 --> 00:16:42,604
The bar is full.

291
00:16:42,687 --> 00:16:44,188
It will take you a minute.

292
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,511
Are they going to demand that
you serve them right away?

293
00:16:46,535 --> 00:16:47,274
Do me the favor.

294
00:16:47,358 --> 00:16:51,195
How many times have you come? When did
i leave the bar and take the tables?

295
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:53,906
I'll ask you... I'll pay you.
I'll give you $ 20.

296
00:16:54,824 --> 00:16:56,242
I'll give you $ 20 just for that.

297
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:57,994
And I'll pay for the drinks, too.

298
00:17:01,413 --> 00:17:03,499
No. We did not ask for that.

299
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,251
I know. They are on his side.

300
00:17:05,334 --> 00:17:06,961
- Do you know him?
- Do not.

301
00:17:07,044 --> 00:17:08,963
I'm going.

302
00:17:10,214 --> 00:17:12,383
This is because I almost killed you.

303
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:13,467
Careless.

304
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,553
How are you? I've never
seen them here before.

305
00:17:16,638 --> 00:17:17,639
These are my friends.

306
00:17:17,722 --> 00:17:20,266
- Gentlemen! Introduce yourself.
- Hello.

307
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:23,435
We may be many.
Tonight, I pay for the drinks.

308
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:24,687
- All right.
- Totally.

309
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:26,188
Why not? If you say it.

310
00:17:26,272 --> 00:17:28,107
- Eddie.
- Hello. Eve.

311
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,734
- Nice to meet you, Eva.
- Equally.

312
00:17:29,817 --> 00:17:31,360
- Sorry about that before.
- I'm sorry.

313
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:38,034
All!

314
00:17:57,428 --> 00:17:59,764
- Play here.
- Agree.

315
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:01,057
- It is normal.
- Very good.

316
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,266
Touch it. Yes.

317
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:03,349
And so...

318
00:18:04,226 --> 00:18:05,436
Heavens!

319
00:18:06,437 --> 00:18:07,897
- What is that?
- Seriously.

320
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,774
It's huge, is not it?

321
00:18:09,857 --> 00:18:11,818
You have a sweet heart. Noticeable.

322
00:18:11,901 --> 00:18:13,820
- It comes from music.
- Really?

323
00:18:13,903 --> 00:18:15,988
Your way of dancing to the beat of music.

324
00:18:16,072 --> 00:18:17,531
That's what changes everything.

325
00:18:17,614 --> 00:18:19,116
Thanks for saying so.

326
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,617
No one had told me.

327
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:23,287
Press it. Come on.

328
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,372
- Go with the black woman.
- Which do you like?

329
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,373
Which do you like?

330
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,085
The black one.

331
00:18:30,127 --> 00:18:31,754
Tell me about your friend Eddie.

332
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:33,840
Mary...

333
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:36,342
- Eddie? What do you want to know? Look.
- I don't know.

334
00:18:36,425 --> 00:18:38,761
He's talking to my friend. Yes.

335
00:18:40,805 --> 00:18:42,223
True?

336
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:46,143
You. Are they nurses?
They work together.

337
00:18:46,227 --> 00:18:48,896
- Yes.
- Great.

338
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:51,774
- Interesting.
- I know.

339
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:56,112
Why do you like to take care of people?

340
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:58,655
I always wanted to.

341
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,700
Yes? Yes.

342
00:19:00,783 --> 00:19:04,536
You have a huge muscle.
You can do whatever you want with it.

343
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,999
I don't know. I like to
take care of people.

344
00:19:08,082 --> 00:19:10,209
And I like... the best... yeah?

345
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:11,836
What I enjoy of my work.

346
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,800
Is to teach people to
take care of themselves.

347
00:19:17,884 --> 00:19:20,302
- Interesting.
- It's an attractive quality.

348
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:31,147
Well, friends.

349
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
Yes.

350
00:19:35,712 --> 00:19:36,712
Yes?

351
00:19:36,736 --> 00:19:38,487
You must go home. I am sorry.

352
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,156
- Agree.
- If it's late.

353
00:19:46,287 --> 00:19:49,415
I've always been here
since high school.

354
00:19:49,498 --> 00:19:50,541
Really? Yes.

355
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:52,251
Can it be to take away? Yes.

356
00:19:52,334 --> 00:19:54,211
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

357
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:55,797
<i>I'm a nerd </i>.

358
00:19:56,964 --> 00:19:59,300
A very disciplined nerd.

359
00:19:59,383 --> 00:20:03,387
- Have you always been disciplined?
- Yes always.

360
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,721
How good.

361
00:20:04,806 --> 00:20:06,348
Do you believe? Yes.

362
00:20:06,432 --> 00:20:08,059
Why did you go out tonight?

363
00:20:09,185 --> 00:20:11,520
My friends insisted.

364
00:20:11,603 --> 00:20:15,149
- They said I'm bored and...
- Yes, but why today?

365
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,902
- Because today you went out.
- I don't know.

366
00:20:17,985 --> 00:20:20,905
You decided to go to that bar.
Why tonight?

367
00:20:22,114 --> 00:20:23,950
It's a nice coincidence.

368
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:26,410
I do not believe in coincidences.

369
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:29,496
Really, I do not believe in them.

370
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,624
I think everything happens for a reason.

371
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:33,918
Yes me too.

372
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:36,753
I was very lucky today.

373
00:20:36,838 --> 00:20:38,464
And so,

374
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:42,343
you decided to leave and you never go out!

375
00:20:42,426 --> 00:20:45,471
And you went to that shitty bar.
Yes.

376
00:20:46,722 --> 00:20:49,516
Really. What is the probability?

377
00:20:50,434 --> 00:20:51,768
I do not know, but it was great.

378
00:20:51,853 --> 00:20:54,396
It would not be repeated
in a million years!

379
00:20:55,898 --> 00:20:58,317
I don't know. I find it exciting.

380
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,863
Sometimes, the world is perfect.

381
00:21:02,905 --> 00:21:04,323
- I know.
- Other times, no.

382
00:21:04,406 --> 00:21:07,784
Most of the time, no.
But when it is...

383
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:09,703
- You speak like crazy, but...
- Yes?

384
00:21:09,786 --> 00:21:11,330
- I like it.
- Very good.

385
00:21:12,832 --> 00:21:14,708
I had a great time.

386
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:15,792
I know.

387
00:21:15,877 --> 00:21:18,129
- I had a great time with you.
- I also.

388
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:20,172
- We could repeat it.
- Of course.

389
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,465
- You want?
- May l...

390
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:23,009
I can give you my number.

391
00:21:23,092 --> 00:21:24,426
- Yes.
- Yes?

392
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,014
I'll give you my phone. Mark it,

393
00:21:28,097 --> 00:21:30,224
and I'll call you. Yes.

394
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,396
We could have breakfast one of these days.

395
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:38,440
I'm not very early riser.

396
00:21:38,524 --> 00:21:42,778
Do you ever go out to lunch
or have a drink? Or...

397
00:21:42,862 --> 00:21:44,321
I am very busy.

398
00:21:44,405 --> 00:21:45,531
- Yes?
- So...

399
00:21:45,614 --> 00:21:47,533
I'm only free in the morning. I am sorry.

400
00:21:47,616 --> 00:21:50,161
- That is all? Only in the morning.
- And very early.

401
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:53,539
- How early?
- At 7:00 or 7:30.

402
00:21:53,622 --> 00:21:54,623
- It's okay.
- Yes?

403
00:21:54,706 --> 00:21:56,292
- It's okay?
- Yes cool.

404
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,377
- Agree?
- Then yes.

405
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,254
I'm impatient for... yes.

406
00:22:01,172 --> 00:22:02,381
See you in the morning.

407
00:22:03,132 --> 00:22:05,885
I will call you. We'll meet.
We'll pick one day.

408
00:22:05,968 --> 00:22:07,303
- Perfect.
- Very good.

409
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:45,591
Today is the day, Eddie.

410
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:48,927
Today is the day.

411
00:22:54,642 --> 00:22:56,810
They should run on the
lawn, but not today.

412
00:22:56,893 --> 00:22:58,687
- They run on sand.
- All right.

413
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,689
- Should not have problems.
- Great.

414
00:23:00,773 --> 00:23:03,400
Kit's in the fifth, right?

415
00:23:03,484 --> 00:23:04,902
Yes.
All right. In the seventh...

416
00:23:13,785 --> 00:23:14,786
<i>Hi. How are you?</i>

417
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:26,715
Come on!

418
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:29,218
Do it!

419
00:23:29,301 --> 00:23:30,927
Just!

420
00:23:41,813 --> 00:23:44,108
Yes. You know what? I'll bring it.

421
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:46,818
- Come on! Run!
- Go!

422
00:23:47,611 --> 00:23:48,945
Heavens.

423
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,281
Maybe we will win.

424
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:54,743
Come on!

425
00:24:20,561 --> 00:24:21,562
Nicky.

426
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:23,480
Hi.

427
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:26,275
I need a favor, my friend.

428
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:29,611
Do you still have the keys to my house?

429
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:38,079
- What about the rain?
- A storm is coming.

430
00:24:38,162 --> 00:24:40,372
- Will they postpone the race?
- They 're suspended.

431
00:24:40,456 --> 00:24:42,291
Yes? Shit. It's a joke?

432
00:24:43,292 --> 00:24:45,336
Agree. Thank you. Shit.

433
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,806
It's a nightmare, damn it!

434
00:25:38,305 --> 00:25:39,556
I can enter?

435
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,641
Yes.

436
00:25:41,267 --> 00:25:46,438
Two three four five six seven...

437
00:25:46,522 --> 00:25:48,274
You want it all in chips? Yes.

438
00:25:48,357 --> 00:25:50,025
One, two, three, four, sir.

439
00:25:50,108 --> 00:25:51,402
- Yes, give me three.
- Three?

440
00:25:51,485 --> 00:25:52,986
One, two and three.

441
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:55,281
Show them. We match.

442
00:25:55,364 --> 00:25:57,491
- Damned...
- Kings and three.

443
00:25:57,574 --> 00:25:59,451
Double pairs. Nothing?

444
00:25:59,535 --> 00:26:02,204
We have another $ 250.

445
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:04,164
- They all match.
- Another one.

446
00:26:04,248 --> 00:26:05,332
I also match.

447
00:26:05,415 --> 00:26:07,334
- The well is fine.
- What, not even?

448
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:08,252
How many letters?

449
00:26:08,335 --> 00:26:11,046
A. If you give me the one i
need, I'll take all the money.

450
00:26:12,589 --> 00:26:14,109
- The biggest hand.
- I put everything.

451
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:16,051
- Motherfucker.
- Couple of nines.

452
00:26:18,304 --> 00:26:21,682
You're good. Quiet.

453
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:25,686
I stay and I get it back.

454
00:26:32,276 --> 00:26:33,694
All in chips? Yes.

455
00:26:33,777 --> 00:26:36,655
- He is okay?
- Great.

456
00:26:36,738 --> 00:26:38,907
Give me the chips, please. Thank you.

457
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,410
- He passed.
- He passed.

458
00:26:41,493 --> 00:26:42,578
Four up.

459
00:26:43,954 --> 00:26:45,080
Pair of eights.

460
00:26:45,163 --> 00:26:46,957
Pair of aces, that wins.

461
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,879
- I see.
- I see.

462
00:26:52,963 --> 00:26:55,424
It is the parallel well. $ 500.

463
00:27:02,598 --> 00:27:03,599
Two.

464
00:27:04,516 --> 00:27:07,185
- One two. You want letters.
- Three.

465
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:09,104
And three nice letters.

466
00:27:09,187 --> 00:27:13,400
Someone sees and climbs.

467
00:27:13,484 --> 00:27:16,403
We have $ 400 plus $ 1,100.
The bet is $ 1500.

468
00:27:16,487 --> 00:27:17,488
It's too much for me.

469
00:27:17,571 --> 00:27:19,448
The bet is $ 1,500.

470
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:21,950
<i>Wait. I have not seen it yet.</i>

471
00:27:22,033 --> 00:27:23,702
<i>Do you see it or do you retire?</i>

472
00:27:23,785 --> 00:27:26,455
We see the hand. He shows them.

473
00:27:26,538 --> 00:27:28,081
Yes. Strong bets.

474
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:30,459
- Damned.
- It's a joke?

475
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:33,670
It has a full, gentlemen.

476
00:27:33,754 --> 00:27:34,796
Amazing.

477
00:27:35,547 --> 00:27:38,259
This is yours, my friend. All yours.

478
00:27:38,342 --> 00:27:40,302
I had never seen anything like it.

479
00:27:41,387 --> 00:27:42,721
Amazing.

480
00:28:05,536 --> 00:28:10,541
Eva: "Is breakfast still?"

481
00:28:17,714 --> 00:28:19,215
Looks like you rested.

482
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,635
Did you have a good night? What did you do?

483
00:28:22,553 --> 00:28:23,679
If I...

484
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:30,268
I took my daughter and watched
television with my mom.

485
00:28:31,186 --> 00:28:32,313
So yes.

486
00:28:32,396 --> 00:28:33,397
Great.

487
00:28:34,523 --> 00:28:36,149
A daughter. Yes.

488
00:28:38,109 --> 00:28:41,822
How...? How old are you?

489
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:43,156
Seven.

490
00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:44,283
Seven?

491
00:28:44,366 --> 00:28:45,534
It's already big.

492
00:28:47,703 --> 00:28:49,871
The father...?

493
00:28:49,955 --> 00:28:52,416
Are you married to him, or...?

494
00:28:53,334 --> 00:28:54,335
Do not.

495
00:28:54,418 --> 00:28:56,336
She... that is, he...

496
00:28:56,795 --> 00:29:00,507
He got lost in Mexico forever.

497
00:29:00,591 --> 00:29:01,883
What?

498
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:06,054
Is that normal in Mexico?
Get lost forever.

499
00:29:06,137 --> 00:29:07,263
It's awful.

500
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,809
- He's not with us.
- No this...

501
00:29:10,892 --> 00:29:14,605
It is there, and it will never come.

502
00:29:14,688 --> 00:29:16,440
We have no contact.

503
00:29:16,523 --> 00:29:21,945
That is a relief for someone.
For me, I suppose.

504
00:29:22,028 --> 00:29:23,989
But maybe not for you, and I'm sorry.

505
00:29:24,072 --> 00:29:28,118
Really? Because three women...
Its a lot...

506
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:30,161
- Yes it is much.
- To assume it.

507
00:29:30,245 --> 00:29:32,914
You are ready? I do not think so.

508
00:29:32,998 --> 00:29:37,043
How about if we eat breakfast
and see if we like the food?

509
00:29:37,961 --> 00:29:40,046
Then we'll think about all that.

510
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,190
You're right.

511
00:29:41,214 --> 00:29:42,924
- Sorry for the wait.
- Thank you.

512
00:29:43,008 --> 00:29:45,719
- Would you like some coffee?
- Yes please. Just coffee.

513
00:29:45,844 --> 00:29:46,844
You, lady?

514
00:29:47,388 --> 00:29:49,640
- Orange juice. Thank you.
- To you.

515
00:29:49,765 --> 00:29:56,271
I think it's great that you
start breakfast like this.

516
00:29:56,355 --> 00:29:59,107
I was not entirely honest that night.

517
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,567
I do not have my own business.

518
00:30:00,651 --> 00:30:03,695
I do not spend much.
I do not usually have that much money.

519
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:04,780
Agree.

520
00:30:04,863 --> 00:30:05,697
So...

521
00:30:05,781 --> 00:30:09,242
And if it's not what you
expected, I'm sorry. I cheated.

522
00:30:10,326 --> 00:30:11,703
How do you win the life?

523
00:30:11,787 --> 00:30:13,372
How do I make a living? Yes.

524
00:30:14,414 --> 00:30:15,832
It is difficult to know today.

525
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:18,419
But after passing...

526
00:30:18,502 --> 00:30:20,504
You do not seem shy at all.

527
00:30:20,587 --> 00:30:21,630
Not really.

528
00:30:21,713 --> 00:30:24,132
Because you are different.
I do not know why.

529
00:30:24,216 --> 00:30:27,260
When you meet someone,
you are extroverted.

530
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:28,554
Yes, exactly.

531
00:30:28,637 --> 00:30:31,682
If I do not know them, I'm very shy.

532
00:30:31,765 --> 00:30:33,975
<i>- I am sorry.
- Gene, do not do that.</i>

533
00:30:35,394 --> 00:30:36,395
Please.

534
00:30:39,189 --> 00:30:41,107
That was a week ago.

535
00:30:41,191 --> 00:30:43,234
- Gene...
- We talked a week ago.

536
00:30:43,318 --> 00:30:46,321
I am sorry. I should not laugh.

537
00:30:46,405 --> 00:30:47,781
I should not laugh.

538
00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:51,618
- Gene.
- I am sorry. Is that...

539
00:30:51,702 --> 00:30:54,079
- I'm at my worst.
- I know. I am sorry.

540
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,164
Help me, I beg you.

541
00:30:56,248 --> 00:30:58,583
- Agree. I know.
- You're laughing at me.

542
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:02,713
Are you willing to change?

543
00:31:02,796 --> 00:31:04,548
Yes, 100%

544
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:05,924
- really?
- Yes, 100%.

545
00:31:06,007 --> 00:31:08,469
Are not you going to stay
here complaining and saying,

546
00:31:08,552 --> 00:31:12,305
"i made bad decisions,"
then rejected my advice?

547
00:31:12,388 --> 00:31:16,602
- This is different.
- But do you understand why I say it?

548
00:31:16,685 --> 00:31:18,285
Do you understand my restlessness?
Yes.

549
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:21,607
Because you did it 4268
times in the past.

550
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,024
This is... yes.

551
00:31:23,108 --> 00:31:25,861
I am totally willing to change.
I'm scared.

552
00:31:25,944 --> 00:31:28,113
I never thought this would happen.

553
00:31:28,196 --> 00:31:29,196
- Please.
- Good.

554
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:31,575
Lets start by the beginning.

555
00:31:31,658 --> 00:31:35,829
You must admit that you're an idiot.

556
00:31:36,412 --> 00:31:38,039
I admit that I'm an idiot.

557
00:31:38,624 --> 00:31:43,086
I need you to say:
"My name is... and I'm an idiot."

558
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:44,420
Why?

559
00:31:44,504 --> 00:31:47,382
Because that statement is real.
It becomes real.

560
00:31:47,466 --> 00:31:50,426
If you are willing to humiliate yourself,
i will know that you are serious.

561
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,597
My name is Edward Garrett
and I'm an idiot.

562
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,517
All right. And now I want you to say:

563
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,061
"My name was Edward Garrett
and my friend gene was right."

564
00:32:00,145 --> 00:32:03,439
- I'm addicted to losing.
- Why do I have to say this about you?

565
00:32:03,524 --> 00:32:04,525
Agree.

566
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:09,946
My name is Edward Garrett and
my friend gene was right.

567
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,490
I'm addicted to losing.

568
00:32:11,573 --> 00:32:13,575
- That was easy for you.
- Yes, you were right.

569
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:16,202
You must have serious problems.
Yes.

570
00:32:16,286 --> 00:32:17,328
Agree.

571
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,958
If you laugh after all
that, I'll kill you.

572
00:32:22,876 --> 00:32:26,588
Gene, this behavior is inappropriate.

573
00:32:26,672 --> 00:32:27,714
I am sorry.

574
00:32:27,798 --> 00:32:30,509
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. It makes me laugh.

575
00:32:30,592 --> 00:32:33,637
- You're a bad person.
- It is not my intention. Is that...

576
00:32:34,345 --> 00:32:37,182
It's not funny.

577
00:32:37,265 --> 00:32:39,309
All right. We'll fix it.

578
00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:40,894
I do not understand. We'll fix it.

579
00:32:40,977 --> 00:32:43,605
We'll do whatever it takes.
We'll get you up.

580
00:32:43,689 --> 00:32:45,023
- Agree?
- Yes thanks.

581
00:32:51,237 --> 00:32:52,781
How many did you throw?

582
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:57,285
Six? All right. Nothing happens.
We can do it.

583
00:32:57,368 --> 00:32:59,079
I have to ask for them.

584
00:32:59,162 --> 00:33:00,539
Do you want me to go out?

585
00:33:00,622 --> 00:33:01,832
No, it's no problem.

586
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:04,918
Julio is leaving.
I'll ask you to do it.

587
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:06,127
All right. Bye, Kim.

588
00:33:07,045 --> 00:33:08,547
- Hello.
- Hello.

589
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,298
- How are you?
- No good.

590
00:33:11,466 --> 00:33:12,676
What's going on?

591
00:33:13,677 --> 00:33:14,678
I...

592
00:33:16,888 --> 00:33:21,392
I'm in a shit situation
and I feel ashamed.

593
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,647
And I... what is it, Eddie?

594
00:33:28,066 --> 00:33:33,154
I ended up losing money I did not have.
I owe more than $ 20,000.

595
00:33:33,238 --> 00:33:34,865
- I do not have $ 20,000.
- I know.

596
00:33:34,948 --> 00:33:37,200
- It's ridiculous!
- I'm not asking for a loan.

597
00:33:37,283 --> 00:33:40,453
I'm not begging you.
That ended. Yes?

598
00:33:40,537 --> 00:33:41,663
What did you come for?

599
00:33:41,913 --> 00:33:44,291
I'm going to go to meetings
and I'm going to change.

600
00:33:44,374 --> 00:33:45,375
I want employment.

601
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:46,627
I want to work for you.

602
00:33:47,377 --> 00:33:48,712
Do you want to work for me?

603
00:33:50,881 --> 00:33:52,007
Seriously? Yes.

604
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:54,760
- Very good.
- I need...

605
00:33:54,843 --> 00:33:58,054
- Bottoms out. I know.
- Agree.

606
00:33:58,847 --> 00:34:00,056
This is what we will do.

607
00:34:00,974 --> 00:34:02,684
- I'll offer you a job.
- Thank you.

608
00:34:02,768 --> 00:34:05,270
You will start from below, as
you would have wanted chips.

609
00:34:05,353 --> 00:34:06,271
- Clear.
- Yes?

610
00:34:06,354 --> 00:34:07,939
No weekly rest. Yes.

611
00:34:08,023 --> 00:34:09,274
I will not give you anything.

612
00:34:09,357 --> 00:34:10,984
I'll make you work hard, okay?
Yes.

613
00:34:11,902 --> 00:34:17,032
If you do well, no problems
or excuses for six months,

614
00:34:17,115 --> 00:34:23,079
I will lend you the part of the debt
that you do not cover with labor.

615
00:34:23,163 --> 00:34:24,664
It's more than I ask, Ron.

616
00:34:24,748 --> 00:34:27,667
It's what I give you, what
you take and what there is.

617
00:34:27,751 --> 00:34:29,335
Are you going to work for me?
Yes.

618
00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:31,462
- Seriously?
- There will be no problems.

619
00:34:31,546 --> 00:34:35,008
I'm sure there will be no problems.
Yes?

620
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:36,301
Very good.

621
00:34:36,384 --> 00:34:37,552
Let's do it. Yes.

622
00:34:37,636 --> 00:34:39,846
- I'm glad you're here.
- Thank you.

623
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:42,473
- Seriously, no nonsense. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

624
00:34:42,557 --> 00:34:44,475
You're welcome. Good.

625
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:46,394
It is done.

626
00:34:46,477 --> 00:34:49,648
Because I can not take it anymore.
My heart can not stand it.

627
00:34:49,731 --> 00:34:51,900
- It's the last time we do it.
- It's over.

628
00:34:51,983 --> 00:34:53,234
If I'm sure.

629
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,376
I get it. Yes.

630
00:35:13,463 --> 00:35:17,008
Very good. Shut up.

631
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,503
Here's the guy.

632
00:35:53,586 --> 00:35:54,963
Here it comes.

633
00:35:55,046 --> 00:35:57,173
Here is my man.

634
00:35:59,342 --> 00:36:00,468
How you feel?

635
00:36:01,386 --> 00:36:03,764
Come here. Very good.

636
00:36:03,847 --> 00:36:06,391
Gentlemen, my friend Eddie.

637
00:36:06,474 --> 00:36:07,726
- My brother.
- Hello.

638
00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:11,479
They are Freddy, Tony and Alex. Yes?
Yes.

639
00:36:11,562 --> 00:36:14,315
He is nervous.

640
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:16,860
Because he never saw the light of the day.

641
00:36:16,943 --> 00:36:19,279
Or yes, but usually before bed.

642
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:22,240
Hey, he's my brother,

643
00:36:22,323 --> 00:36:25,160
but that does not mean that
you can not be hard on him.

644
00:36:25,243 --> 00:36:26,702
Do not be soft.

645
00:36:26,787 --> 00:36:27,954
Make it work.

646
00:37:00,445 --> 00:37:01,487
Agree.

647
00:37:02,447 --> 00:37:05,075
Looks good. You're good? Yes.

648
00:37:05,158 --> 00:37:06,659
- What is this?
- What?

649
00:37:06,743 --> 00:37:08,620
It's sweat. I've never seen it before.

650
00:37:08,703 --> 00:37:09,830
You've learned something.

651
00:37:09,913 --> 00:37:11,915
He does not know how to
use the rake or anything.

652
00:37:11,998 --> 00:37:13,541
I used another kind of rake.

653
00:37:13,624 --> 00:37:14,750
This is worse.

654
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:17,962
If you cut your lawn better than you play
bowling. It's okay. Giving me a call.

655
00:37:18,046 --> 00:37:19,297
- All right.
- Giving me a call.

656
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:25,720
That's my man.

657
00:37:26,387 --> 00:37:28,348
- He's my man.
- Back.

658
00:37:29,765 --> 00:37:32,435
- I'm glad you're here.
- Me too.

659
00:37:33,561 --> 00:37:35,646
This is great.
Hey, I'll introduce you to Eddie.

660
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,234
Maybe they recognize it.
He has not come for a long time.

661
00:37:40,651 --> 00:37:42,988
The important thing is that he returned.

662
00:37:43,071 --> 00:37:44,697
- Yes.
- Glad to be back.

663
00:38:03,216 --> 00:38:04,509
Are you coming to work?

664
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:09,973
Yes, I'm sorry.

665
00:38:11,391 --> 00:38:13,059
I'm sorry, lunch killed me.

666
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,148
You can!

667
00:38:18,982 --> 00:38:20,901
- Ends.
- You must throw again.

668
00:38:20,984 --> 00:38:22,818
- Again?
- Yes!

669
00:38:24,863 --> 00:38:27,073
You will see.

670
00:38:27,657 --> 00:38:29,117
- Well done.
- You're up!

671
00:38:31,202 --> 00:38:33,163
- Good shot.
- Thank you.

672
00:38:34,831 --> 00:38:36,624
Did you want to use that one?
Yes.

673
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:38,585
- Use it.
- Use the girls' ball.

674
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:39,878
My thumb got stuck.

675
00:38:42,923 --> 00:38:44,257
Well, I'm going to pitch.

676
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,509
That hurt.

677
00:38:46,592 --> 00:38:47,593
How good.

678
00:38:48,553 --> 00:38:51,222
He cared about you.
That's what's important.

679
00:38:51,306 --> 00:38:53,308
- Right.
- Just like my dad.

680
00:38:53,391 --> 00:38:55,851
Chips cared... whatever happens,

681
00:38:55,936 --> 00:38:58,563
he loved my brother and
me more than anyone.

682
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:04,986
<i>There may be success at
the end of this tunnel.</i>

683
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:08,323
<i>But, for me, it was an
incredible feeling.</i>

684
00:39:08,406 --> 00:39:10,992
You feel like a child again. So.

685
00:39:11,076 --> 00:39:14,870
Not even as a child.
Sometimes you feel like a baby.

686
00:39:14,955 --> 00:39:18,291
As if someone else had to
take care of the situation.

687
00:39:19,417 --> 00:39:21,127
"I can not do anything. What I do?".

688
00:39:21,211 --> 00:39:24,047
You could go to work and make money.

689
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,174
But people expect things from you.

690
00:39:26,841 --> 00:39:29,010
They want you to do other things. And me...

691
00:39:29,928 --> 00:39:31,888
I was being childish.

692
00:39:31,972 --> 00:39:33,723
- Hello.
- Hello.

693
00:39:33,806 --> 00:39:35,558
I think I'm going home.

694
00:39:35,641 --> 00:39:37,685
I want to see Jude
before she falls asleep.

695
00:39:37,768 --> 00:39:39,770
Show me what to do with this order.

696
00:39:39,854 --> 00:39:40,981
I want to do it right.

697
00:39:41,064 --> 00:39:43,483
You enter in quickbooks.

698
00:39:43,566 --> 00:39:46,694
You organize them, and we can
process them and send the invoices.

699
00:39:46,777 --> 00:39:48,613
So, is this no longer useful?

700
00:39:48,696 --> 00:39:50,615
- Yes, that is no longer used.
- All right.

701
00:39:50,698 --> 00:39:51,699
Great.

702
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,910
I'm proud. Well done.

703
00:39:53,993 --> 00:39:57,455
- Thank you. It's important to me.
- This helps us a lot.

704
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:01,167
When you're done with that,
you can throw it away.

705
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,710
- Great. I love.
- All right.

706
00:40:03,378 --> 00:40:04,754
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

707
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:07,840
- Greetings to all of you.
- I will do it.

708
00:40:18,268 --> 00:40:19,269
Hi.

709
00:40:19,352 --> 00:40:21,312
- How are you?
- What happened, Victor?

710
00:40:22,063 --> 00:40:23,523
Are you going to pay today?

711
00:40:23,606 --> 00:40:25,066
I'm going to pay now!

712
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,568
- Friend!
- That's for you, my friend.

713
00:40:27,652 --> 00:40:29,320
- Agree.
- Thank you, Victor.

714
00:40:29,404 --> 00:40:30,989
- The last.
- Thank you, Victor.

715
00:40:31,072 --> 00:40:33,324
- My name is Eddie.
- Eddie...

716
00:40:33,408 --> 00:40:35,285
- It's okay. Thank you.
- All right, Eddie.

717
00:40:35,368 --> 00:40:37,162
- Thanks friend.
- All right.

718
00:40:37,245 --> 00:40:38,704
- All in order.
- Very good.

719
00:40:38,788 --> 00:40:41,416
- Bye. Thank you.
- Very good.

720
00:40:41,499 --> 00:40:44,710
- Goodbye friend.
- Bye. I love you.

721
00:40:44,794 --> 00:40:47,547
- And I to you. Bye.
- All right. Bye.

722
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,798
<i>- That's why.
- Why?</i>

723
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:51,301
Because in Mexico there
are no large tortillas.

724
00:40:51,384 --> 00:40:53,136
There are only small tortillas.

725
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:55,055
How do you make a burrito
with the big ones?

726
00:40:55,138 --> 00:40:56,931
- But...
- I mean, little...

727
00:40:57,015 --> 00:40:58,641
They can make large tortillas.

728
00:40:58,724 --> 00:41:01,394
It's not that they do not have
the technology to do them.

729
00:41:01,477 --> 00:41:03,604
You are right.

730
00:41:03,688 --> 00:41:07,317
In Mexico there are only small tortillas.
You are good.

731
00:41:08,068 --> 00:41:10,153
We always pretend it's time.

732
00:41:10,236 --> 00:41:12,363
- It's time.
- It's always beer time.

733
00:41:13,323 --> 00:41:15,003
I have to go. Tomorrow, I'll get up early.

734
00:41:15,027 --> 00:41:16,826
- What?
- I have to go.

735
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:18,536
He has to work in the nursery.

736
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:20,830
- Yes, art. See you, pat.
- Bye, James.

737
00:41:20,913 --> 00:41:22,332
- Eddie.
- Goodbye friend.

738
00:41:22,415 --> 00:41:26,836
I do not like to think that i
am addicted to the game, but...

739
00:41:26,919 --> 00:41:31,257
I keep betting and losing, so...

740
00:41:31,341 --> 00:41:34,302
I'm not an idiot. True?

741
00:41:34,385 --> 00:41:39,390
And the feeling of having nothing, being
a loser and being without a penny.

742
00:41:39,474 --> 00:41:41,059
You get into the body and...

743
00:41:41,976 --> 00:41:44,145
That's the feeling I chase.

744
00:41:44,229 --> 00:41:45,855
I do not want to pursue her anymore.

745
00:41:46,897 --> 00:41:48,691
Because it's a horrible feeling.

746
00:41:49,442 --> 00:41:56,282
And I'm here to stop chasing that
shit and straightening the course.

747
00:41:56,574 --> 00:41:58,451
- My favorite part.
- Thank you.

748
00:41:58,534 --> 00:42:00,161
- You earned it.
- Thank you.

749
00:42:00,245 --> 00:42:02,247
I'm proud of you. Well done.

750
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,165
- I gave you some more.
- What is this?

751
00:42:04,249 --> 00:42:06,959
I give the boys an
extra every week.

752
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:09,212
Listen, have fun on the weekend.

753
00:42:09,295 --> 00:42:11,130
- Treat yourself.
- Thank you. I will do it.

754
00:42:11,214 --> 00:42:12,214
See you Monday.

755
00:42:14,384 --> 00:42:15,968
- Good friend.
- Very good.

756
00:42:17,052 --> 00:42:18,053
Do not behave yourself.

757
00:42:18,971 --> 00:42:21,599
- I have $ 200. I am rich!
- Yes!

758
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,601
Watch out.

759
00:42:24,727 --> 00:42:26,437
- Hello.
- Hello.

760
00:42:37,407 --> 00:42:38,699
You look great.

761
00:42:39,909 --> 00:42:41,702
- They're for you.
- You look great.

762
00:42:41,786 --> 00:42:42,787
Thank you.

763
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:46,207
Are you ready? Yes.

764
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:50,586
You know? I like the business
more than I thought.

765
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:53,214
I thought I would not like that part,

766
00:42:53,298 --> 00:42:54,590
but I like it.

767
00:42:54,674 --> 00:43:00,054
It is structured so that Ron owns
all of the capital of the company.

768
00:43:00,138 --> 00:43:02,932
But by contract, half is mine.

769
00:43:03,015 --> 00:43:07,478
His dream, and it begins to be
mine too, is that we both own 50%.

770
00:43:07,562 --> 00:43:11,649
I'm going to work and
save to buy a part.

771
00:43:11,732 --> 00:43:14,152
Some extra work.

772
00:43:14,235 --> 00:43:17,238
We will count them as
capital up to 50%.

773
00:43:17,321 --> 00:43:21,117
Then we'll run it together and
we can do whatever we want.

774
00:43:21,201 --> 00:43:23,661
The business is doing very well, in fact.

775
00:43:23,744 --> 00:43:25,455
But I think it could improve.

776
00:43:25,538 --> 00:43:27,373
They could inherit our children and...

777
00:43:27,457 --> 00:43:29,625
They want dessert?

778
00:43:31,669 --> 00:43:34,422
I'll leave you some menus.

779
00:43:34,505 --> 00:43:35,665
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

780
00:43:35,689 --> 00:43:36,689
Thank you.

781
00:43:37,342 --> 00:43:38,926
What do you think? Do you want dessert?

782
00:43:39,009 --> 00:43:40,595
- Do not.
- Do not.

783
00:43:40,678 --> 00:43:44,182
- Do you like this place?
- Is not my style.

784
00:43:44,265 --> 00:43:45,933
Mine neither.

785
00:43:46,016 --> 00:43:47,893
I just came to impress you.

786
00:43:47,977 --> 00:43:49,061
Really? Yes.

787
00:43:49,144 --> 00:43:50,289
I did not know, I did not know it.
Yes.

788
00:43:50,313 --> 00:43:51,481
- You know what?
- What?

789
00:43:51,564 --> 00:43:53,191
I'll take you to a place I like.

790
00:43:53,858 --> 00:43:55,318
Very good. Yes.

791
00:43:55,401 --> 00:43:56,444
It will be fun.

792
00:43:56,527 --> 00:43:58,696
- Eva, I do not want to do this.
- If you want.

793
00:43:58,779 --> 00:44:00,865
- Really, I do not want to.
- You are going to do it.

794
00:44:00,948 --> 00:44:02,200
- Very good.
- Not seriously.

795
00:44:02,283 --> 00:44:03,868
- You have to dance!
- Very good!

796
00:44:03,951 --> 00:44:05,870
All right. I'll try... dance.

797
00:44:05,953 --> 00:44:07,955
- Yes?
- All right. Let's dance.

798
00:44:08,038 --> 00:44:09,832
- Come on!
- Very good!

799
00:44:09,915 --> 00:44:11,209
One two three. So?

800
00:44:11,292 --> 00:44:12,377
- One two three.
- Yes.

801
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,545
- One two three. Very good.
- Yes.

802
00:44:14,629 --> 00:44:16,922
- You dance very sexi.
- You say that to say.

803
00:44:17,006 --> 00:44:19,425
- Is not true.
- I know. Are you ready?

804
00:44:57,797 --> 00:44:59,590
- You go.
- Do not.

805
00:44:59,674 --> 00:45:01,258
- Only you.
- Come on.

806
00:45:01,342 --> 00:45:02,343
You go.

807
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,161
I have to go.

808
00:45:29,244 --> 00:45:30,330
Invite me in.

809
00:45:32,225 --> 00:45:33,225
You can not.

810
00:45:33,249 --> 00:45:34,834
- I will not make noise.
- Do not.

811
00:45:34,917 --> 00:45:35,835
Are you crazy?

812
00:45:35,918 --> 00:45:38,838
"Please, let me in."
My mom and my daughter are inside.

813
00:45:38,921 --> 00:45:41,716
I know, but I will be so silent
that they will not notice.

814
00:45:41,799 --> 00:45:43,008
I'll leave right away.

815
00:45:43,092 --> 00:45:44,552
I'll come in and leave very quickly.

816
00:45:44,635 --> 00:45:46,220
- Please.
- Oh, my god. Do not.

817
00:45:46,303 --> 00:45:47,304
Do not ruin it.

818
00:45:47,388 --> 00:45:48,431
- Do not.
- Is soon.

819
00:45:48,514 --> 00:45:49,557
- I know.
- Yes?

820
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,975
- I have to go.
- Wait.

821
00:46:21,756 --> 00:46:24,675
Hi. What is wrong with this image?

822
00:46:26,177 --> 00:46:28,471
- I don't know.
- This is in my hand, not in yours.

823
00:46:28,971 --> 00:46:31,599
- I did not have the gas.
- I know. That's why I came.

824
00:46:31,682 --> 00:46:34,644
That's why I spent an hour in western.
To bring you gas.

825
00:46:34,727 --> 00:46:37,605
- Is that a joke, shit?
- Do not.

826
00:46:37,688 --> 00:46:38,939
Are you blaming me?

827
00:46:39,023 --> 00:46:41,859
- The lawn mower has gas.
- It's not my job!

828
00:46:41,942 --> 00:46:43,611
I have to go to five more jobs.

829
00:46:43,694 --> 00:46:46,656
Julio was at school
with a broken mower.

830
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:48,949
And the lawn in half!
It looked like an alien work!

831
00:46:49,033 --> 00:46:51,827
Do not look at me like that.
It's your fault.

832
00:46:51,911 --> 00:46:54,246
- Put the fumes down.
- I am sorry. Hears.

833
00:46:54,329 --> 00:46:56,999
Cut me the salary.
I'm sorry I was wrong!

834
00:46:57,082 --> 00:46:58,083
- Yes?
- Thank you.

835
00:46:58,167 --> 00:47:00,628
I thought I had done everything.
I guess it was not like that.

836
00:47:00,711 --> 00:47:03,673
I will come early and ask
as many questions as I can.

837
00:47:03,756 --> 00:47:05,132
- Thank you.
- I will strive.

838
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,051
Thank you. I'm fucking with you.

839
00:47:08,594 --> 00:47:10,471
I'm fucking with you.

840
00:47:11,138 --> 00:47:12,347
I'm not mad at you.

841
00:47:15,017 --> 00:47:18,145
Do you see the smile? I'm kidding.

842
00:47:18,228 --> 00:47:20,314
This is what is happening.

843
00:47:20,397 --> 00:47:21,441
Get the gas.

844
00:47:21,524 --> 00:47:24,276
Freddy! You forgot the gas.
I brought her!

845
00:47:25,027 --> 00:47:27,488
- Great.
- Very funny.

846
00:47:28,489 --> 00:47:29,490
You smell a little.

847
00:47:29,574 --> 00:47:32,702
- You're an idiot.
- I know.

848
00:47:35,663 --> 00:47:37,915
- That goes in...
- I know where it goes!

849
00:47:40,417 --> 00:47:41,919
- Jude, you can.
- Your turn.

850
00:47:42,002 --> 00:47:43,588
- You can do it!
- Throw them.

851
00:47:43,671 --> 00:47:44,880
Come on, Jude!

852
00:47:44,964 --> 00:47:47,341
I like this.
I have a good feeling.

853
00:47:47,424 --> 00:47:48,468
Very good!

854
00:47:48,551 --> 00:47:51,053
- It diverts well! Is going to give it!
- He's drifting.

855
00:47:52,638 --> 00:47:54,098
Yes!

856
00:47:54,181 --> 00:47:57,142
All right, Ron!

857
00:47:57,226 --> 00:47:59,479
Do not! Ron!

858
00:47:59,562 --> 00:48:00,688
You ruined it!

859
00:48:01,689 --> 00:48:03,273
Give me time.

860
00:48:03,357 --> 00:48:04,441
Do not!

861
00:48:04,525 --> 00:48:06,902
- I have trouble throwing with the arm!
- Do not!

862
00:48:10,322 --> 00:48:11,574
All right, uncle Eddie.

863
00:48:12,492 --> 00:48:14,702
Are you ready? Yes.

864
00:48:14,785 --> 00:48:16,787
I think so. I see.

865
00:48:16,871 --> 00:48:19,331
Go where you want to begin.

866
00:48:28,841 --> 00:48:31,260
- It's okay.
- I mean...

867
00:48:31,343 --> 00:48:33,220
- Amazing.
- You gave it all.

868
00:48:33,303 --> 00:48:36,849
You've been in a very good mood.

869
00:48:36,932 --> 00:48:39,393
You're doing a great job.
The team adores you.

870
00:48:39,476 --> 00:48:41,186
Yes, they are good guys.

871
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:42,354
- Yes.
- Good guys.

872
00:48:42,437 --> 00:48:44,649
It's not as bad as I thought.

873
00:48:44,732 --> 00:48:47,109
You see? You just had to try it.

874
00:48:47,192 --> 00:48:48,528
Working is not difficult.

875
00:48:48,611 --> 00:48:50,070
- Not bad.
- It's fun.

876
00:48:50,154 --> 00:48:51,530
You can do it. It's good.

877
00:48:51,614 --> 00:48:53,115
Do I want to work every day?

878
00:48:53,198 --> 00:48:54,324
- Do not.
- Do not.

879
00:48:54,408 --> 00:48:56,911
- I understand.
- I'm glad when the day is over?

880
00:48:56,994 --> 00:48:58,329
Yes. Yes.

881
00:48:58,954 --> 00:49:00,289
I like to collect my salary?

882
00:49:00,372 --> 00:49:01,790
Yes. Yes.

883
00:49:02,249 --> 00:49:04,168
It's partly the girl you date.

884
00:49:04,251 --> 00:49:07,171
It shows that you like it.

885
00:49:07,254 --> 00:49:09,590
It has you spellbound.

886
00:49:09,674 --> 00:49:11,926
Ron, it's fabulous.

887
00:49:13,052 --> 00:49:14,804
Has it all. Yes.

888
00:49:14,887 --> 00:49:17,264
Is incredible.

889
00:49:18,098 --> 00:49:20,851
I had never felt this way before.

890
00:49:21,852 --> 00:49:23,187
She's smart and fabulous.

891
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:25,230
Let's go slow.
We are getting acquainted.

892
00:49:25,314 --> 00:49:26,982
I imagine everything with her.

893
00:49:27,816 --> 00:49:29,777
I imagine everything. Yes.

894
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:32,863
- I've never felt it. It is different.
- Great. Yes.

895
00:49:32,947 --> 00:49:34,907
Great to hear. Noticeable...

896
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:37,367
It helped you recover.

897
00:49:37,451 --> 00:49:39,912
- Definitely.
- But it has happened before.

898
00:49:39,995 --> 00:49:42,582
Something raises the mood,

899
00:49:43,498 --> 00:49:46,501
but it does not work out as you would like.
Suddenly you're...

900
00:49:46,586 --> 00:49:48,253
But this time it's different.

901
00:49:49,171 --> 00:49:50,923
- Agree.
- That's what I'm telling you.

902
00:49:51,006 --> 00:49:54,259
I'm just saying that
you've said it before,

903
00:49:54,343 --> 00:49:56,929
and it could be... maybe it's different.

904
00:49:57,888 --> 00:50:00,015
Eddie, you got that look and...

905
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:02,685
You're giving me a fucking lecture.
Shut up.

906
00:50:02,768 --> 00:50:04,019
Shut up.

907
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,020
For.

908
00:50:06,856 --> 00:50:07,857
Stop it, shit.

909
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,108
Good.

910
00:50:09,191 --> 00:50:13,279
I just want to make sure you're
on the right track. That is all.

911
00:50:13,362 --> 00:50:16,532
And if it's different with her, I'm glad.

912
00:50:16,616 --> 00:50:18,158
And it probably is.

913
00:50:18,242 --> 00:50:20,870
Maybe you should introduce us.

914
00:50:20,953 --> 00:50:22,788
That would be great. Yes.

915
00:50:22,872 --> 00:50:24,331
- Yes?
- Great.

916
00:50:24,414 --> 00:50:25,833
- Would you like it?
- Clear.

917
00:50:25,916 --> 00:50:28,711
I don't know. Anything. A dinner.

918
00:50:28,794 --> 00:50:31,171
Why do not you invite her to dinner?
Could be.

919
00:50:31,255 --> 00:50:32,715
We will have wine and good food.

920
00:50:32,798 --> 00:50:34,634
We could meet her. I would love to.

921
00:50:34,717 --> 00:50:36,010
Let's dine together.

922
00:50:36,093 --> 00:50:37,344
We will go to your house.

923
00:50:37,427 --> 00:50:38,971
That's what I say. Great.

924
00:50:39,054 --> 00:50:40,514
Its what I say.

925
00:50:40,597 --> 00:50:42,516
I'm glad you said it.

926
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:44,685
Great. Can we stop talking about this?

927
00:50:44,769 --> 00:50:46,061
- It is done. Fact!
- Done!

928
00:50:47,062 --> 00:50:49,189
I should have hit that half-dead.

929
00:50:49,273 --> 00:50:51,776
You are so bad that you failed.

930
00:50:51,859 --> 00:50:54,111
- I'm good.
- Is not true.

931
00:50:57,197 --> 00:50:58,699
It's nothing serious.

932
00:50:58,783 --> 00:51:00,868
- It's just fun.
- Very good.

933
00:51:00,951 --> 00:51:02,787
- That's.
- I'm going to have fun.

934
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:07,166
Wait, I have to park well so you
do not laugh too much at me.

935
00:51:07,249 --> 00:51:08,250
Agree.

936
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:10,386
All right. This is
what is going to happen.

937
00:51:10,398 --> 00:51:11,086
Agree.

938
00:51:12,337 --> 00:51:13,673
We'll go to the gate.

939
00:51:13,756 --> 00:51:15,632
He will make fun of how I parked.

940
00:51:15,716 --> 00:51:17,634
Then he will make fun of my clothes.

941
00:51:17,718 --> 00:51:19,428
The joke will not be funny.

942
00:51:19,511 --> 00:51:23,140
Then he will look at you, he
will have a revelation and say,

943
00:51:23,223 --> 00:51:25,184
"you look adorable".

944
00:51:25,267 --> 00:51:26,811
And you have to say, "thank you."

945
00:51:26,894 --> 00:51:29,021
Then he will exaggerate and say,

946
00:51:29,104 --> 00:51:31,106
welcome to the Taj Mahal.

947
00:51:31,691 --> 00:51:33,943
Eddie, can you get farther
away from the sidewalk?

948
00:51:34,026 --> 00:51:35,027
Very good.

949
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:36,862
Ron, she's Eva.

950
00:51:36,946 --> 00:51:37,947
- My brother.
- Hello.

951
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:39,406
Eva, delighted. Welcome.

952
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:42,326
Did you buy it at ugly cost?

953
00:51:42,409 --> 00:51:43,786
Great. Fantastic. Yes.

954
00:51:43,869 --> 00:51:44,912
You look spectacular.

955
00:51:44,995 --> 00:51:46,997
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

956
00:51:47,081 --> 00:51:49,249
Welcome to the Garrett mansion.

957
00:51:51,711 --> 00:51:53,462
He has a sense of humor. How good.

958
00:51:53,545 --> 00:51:54,964
- Yes.
- Welcome. Come in.

959
00:51:55,672 --> 00:51:59,051
- Welcome to my humble abode.
- Very good.

960
00:51:59,134 --> 00:52:00,845
Why are you trotting like that, Ron?

961
00:52:00,928 --> 00:52:02,429
- I'm excited.
- Dresses?

962
00:52:02,512 --> 00:52:03,513
It is exciting!

963
00:52:03,597 --> 00:52:05,725
- For us too.
- I am glad.

964
00:52:05,808 --> 00:52:08,560
- Our dad...
- I bet a lot.

965
00:52:08,643 --> 00:52:11,396
He played a lot of
cards and lost a lot.

966
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,273
And while playing with friends,

967
00:52:13,357 --> 00:52:16,026
papa always shouted, "chips!"

968
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:19,739
Until finally they said:
"Hey, chips, let's go to the casino."

969
00:52:19,822 --> 00:52:21,573
He accepted, and so he got chips.

970
00:52:21,656 --> 00:52:23,242
- Yes.
- Maybe I'm lucky.

971
00:52:23,325 --> 00:52:24,701
Yes? Yes.

972
00:52:24,785 --> 00:52:27,913
I do not think I'm such a good mother.

973
00:52:27,997 --> 00:52:30,207
- Is incredible.
- She's an amazing mom.

974
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:30,977
Of course.

975
00:52:30,989 --> 00:52:33,085
Insurance. It is difficult
to be a single mother.

976
00:52:33,168 --> 00:52:34,294
Thank you. Yes.

977
00:52:34,378 --> 00:52:37,464
But he sure loves Eddie.
They sure get along.

978
00:52:37,547 --> 00:52:38,590
Good...

979
00:52:40,968 --> 00:52:43,971
- Ahead. I do not care.
- You still do not know him.

980
00:52:44,054 --> 00:52:46,174
- You have not met her?
- They do not know each other?

981
00:52:46,223 --> 00:52:47,767
- Agree.
- All right.

982
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:49,894
I don't know.
Are they going slowly?

983
00:52:49,977 --> 00:52:52,646
I think we have to overcome many filters.

984
00:52:52,729 --> 00:52:54,398
When you have kids, so...

985
00:52:54,481 --> 00:52:56,191
- I agree.
- Yes, definitely.

986
00:52:56,275 --> 00:52:57,818
If this is genuine,

987
00:52:57,902 --> 00:53:00,863
Eddie will have time to
get along with Ella,

988
00:53:00,946 --> 00:53:04,449
but I've never introduced her to my
boyfriends or the people I date.

989
00:53:04,533 --> 00:53:06,911
- Very smart.
- We think that's a good idea,

990
00:53:06,994 --> 00:53:09,830
- but I wish I knew her soon.
- You would be the first.

991
00:53:09,914 --> 00:53:11,206
You're a smart woman.

992
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:12,875
I will be glad to meet you.

993
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:15,544
I do not introduce Jude
to the men I go out with.

994
00:53:16,586 --> 00:53:17,922
- Very good.
- It is a ruler.

995
00:53:18,005 --> 00:53:19,799
I only know what is strictly necessary.

996
00:53:20,549 --> 00:53:23,468
Those are tomatoes.
Look, there's a mature one.

997
00:53:23,552 --> 00:53:24,594
Really? Yes.

998
00:53:24,678 --> 00:53:27,389
- Is incredible.
- So is. I like very much.

999
00:53:27,473 --> 00:53:29,475
Do not ruin it. I love.

1000
00:53:29,558 --> 00:53:32,561
- I do not mean to.
- I already know it.

1001
00:53:32,644 --> 00:53:34,521
I'm just saying I like it. Yes.

1002
00:53:34,605 --> 00:53:37,441
- Me too. It's great.
- A lot. Yes.

1003
00:53:37,524 --> 00:53:38,964
- It's going to be good.
- All right.

1004
00:53:38,988 --> 00:53:41,528
He was not scared of you.

1005
00:53:41,611 --> 00:53:44,781
Look. I'm not a mafioso.

1006
00:53:45,699 --> 00:53:47,492
Thanks for coming.

1007
00:53:49,494 --> 00:53:50,579
I loved it.

1008
00:53:50,662 --> 00:53:52,539
- Really?
- Yeah. I had a great time.

1009
00:53:52,622 --> 00:53:56,376
All right. I also.
I do not usually have fun

1010
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,628
with my brother.

1011
00:53:58,712 --> 00:54:00,714
- But it was great.
- I know.

1012
00:54:00,797 --> 00:54:02,007
Thank you.

1013
00:54:12,226 --> 00:54:13,226
Very good.

1014
00:54:13,853 --> 00:54:16,230
This is the situation.

1015
00:54:16,313 --> 00:54:17,314
Yes?

1016
00:54:19,149 --> 00:54:23,112
My mom and Emma are watching a movie.

1017
00:54:24,029 --> 00:54:26,531
And will return in an hour.

1018
00:54:27,657 --> 00:54:29,409
Maybe we can...

1019
00:54:33,038 --> 00:54:34,039
Wait.

1020
00:54:35,165 --> 00:54:36,500
Maybe we can...

1021
00:55:15,789 --> 00:55:17,582
I do not know where I'm going.

1022
00:55:17,666 --> 00:55:19,001
- Here.
- Very good.

1023
00:55:58,832 --> 00:55:59,833
Good.

1024
00:56:05,672 --> 00:56:06,673
Hi.

1025
00:56:06,756 --> 00:56:11,178
<i>Has a collect call from the
convict's cook county prison...</i>

1026
00:56:11,261 --> 00:56:12,346
<i>Michael.</i>

1027
00:56:12,429 --> 00:56:15,682
<i>If you want to accept
the charges, check one.</i>

1028
00:56:15,765 --> 00:56:17,351
<i>If you want to reject...</i>

1029
00:56:27,319 --> 00:56:29,154
<i>Hi, Eddie. I have good news.</i>

1030
00:56:29,237 --> 00:56:30,322
What happened?

1031
00:56:30,405 --> 00:56:32,658
<i>I will be released soon.</i>

1032
00:56:34,284 --> 00:56:35,284
When?

1033
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:37,287
<i>In eight days.</i>

1034
00:56:40,916 --> 00:56:41,916
What?

1035
00:56:42,417 --> 00:56:46,421
<i>Yes, administrative things, but
they let me out of here. So...</i>

1036
00:56:47,381 --> 00:56:49,132
<i>I hope everything is fine there.</i>

1037
00:56:49,216 --> 00:56:54,554
Yes cool. That's...
Are good news.

1038
00:56:54,638 --> 00:56:57,016
<i>And neglect, our deal is still standing.</i>

1039
00:56:57,099 --> 00:56:58,100
<i>I'll give you your share.</i>

1040
00:56:58,183 --> 00:57:00,852
Yes, I certainly would. Great. This is...

1041
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:03,147
What a good day.

1042
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:07,276
I wanted to get rid of
it, so it's perfect.

1043
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:10,029
<i>Very good. See you next Monday.</i>

1044
00:57:10,112 --> 00:57:11,363
Yes.

1045
00:57:11,446 --> 00:57:12,489
<i>Are you okay, Eddie?</i>

1046
00:57:13,823 --> 00:57:17,369
I? Yes, I'm excited.

1047
00:57:17,452 --> 00:57:18,453
<i>Agree.</i>

1048
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,081
Very good.

1049
00:57:22,457 --> 00:57:23,792
Beware.

1050
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:38,432
- Hello friend.
- Eddie.

1051
00:57:38,515 --> 00:57:40,600
What's up?
You should be in ravenswood.

1052
00:57:40,684 --> 00:57:42,144
- You got a minute?
- Five.

1053
00:57:42,227 --> 00:57:44,313
- I get it.
- You're at my desk.

1054
00:57:44,396 --> 00:57:46,398
I know. I do not want to be here. May l...?

1055
00:57:46,481 --> 00:57:48,275
I do not want you here either.

1056
00:57:48,358 --> 00:57:50,902
- What do you do?
- Ron, I...

1057
00:57:50,985 --> 00:57:54,031
You must know that this is
the last thing I want to do.

1058
00:57:54,948 --> 00:57:58,827
There was an unexpected
and unfortunate event...

1059
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:02,831
Yes, something unexpected and unfortunate:
A cutter that is not cutting.

1060
00:58:02,914 --> 00:58:05,959
- I'm missing a worker.
- Ron, I need you to listen to me.

1061
00:58:06,043 --> 00:58:07,086
What are you doing here?

1062
00:58:07,169 --> 00:58:08,503
Listen to me.

1063
00:58:10,214 --> 00:58:11,715
- The deal we made...
- Yes?

1064
00:58:12,466 --> 00:58:13,967
It is coming out very well.

1065
00:58:14,051 --> 00:58:15,469
Until now.

1066
00:58:15,552 --> 00:58:16,595
But it was...

1067
00:58:16,678 --> 00:58:19,223
I kept everything I promised.
Is not true?

1068
00:58:19,306 --> 00:58:21,141
Is not it true that I changed?
Yes.

1069
00:58:21,225 --> 00:58:22,351
Did you see a change?

1070
00:58:22,434 --> 00:58:24,103
- Eddie, come on...
- Listen to me!

1071
00:58:24,186 --> 00:58:26,105
Do not put that face. Listen to me!

1072
00:58:26,188 --> 00:58:28,565
I'll pay for it.
Only it will take longer.

1073
00:58:28,648 --> 00:58:31,026
- The same conditions.
- At six weeks?

1074
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:35,155
Are you asking me to pay you
what we agreed for six months?

1075
00:58:35,239 --> 00:58:36,948
- Are you kidding?
- Do not!

1076
00:58:37,031 --> 00:58:40,202
I do not care if you
give me back quintuple.

1077
00:58:40,285 --> 00:58:42,788
- You think I want to do it?
- Do not! Do you think I do.

1078
00:58:42,871 --> 00:58:44,414
Do you know how I feel ashamed?

1079
00:58:44,498 --> 00:58:46,875
- Listen to me.
- Do you know how much I hate this?

1080
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:48,460
- Yes. Eddie...
- Please!

1081
00:58:48,543 --> 00:58:49,836
- Eddie...
- Say yes!

1082
00:58:51,796 --> 00:58:53,298
- Say yes, Ron.
- I'm screwed up.

1083
00:58:54,174 --> 00:58:55,509
Say yes, Ron.

1084
00:58:57,136 --> 00:58:58,220
Eddie...

1085
00:58:59,513 --> 00:59:00,639
Do not.

1086
00:59:01,348 --> 00:59:02,349
The answer is no.

1087
00:59:03,057 --> 00:59:04,934
I am sorry. I will not give you money.

1088
00:59:05,018 --> 00:59:07,396
That's not the deal. It
does not work like that.

1089
00:59:15,987 --> 00:59:20,200
Every year hundreds of people
disappear in national parks.

1090
00:59:20,284 --> 00:59:23,245
You could take your car to the
rocky mountains national park.

1091
00:59:23,328 --> 00:59:26,623
It is not far away. You leave
it open with a lit cigarette,

1092
00:59:26,706 --> 00:59:28,542
- and you disappear.
- I like it.

1093
00:59:28,625 --> 00:59:30,043
I'll pick you up.

1094
00:59:30,127 --> 00:59:31,711
You go to Canada and you do whatever.

1095
00:59:31,795 --> 00:59:34,047
And then? What do I do the rest of my life?

1096
00:59:34,131 --> 00:59:35,465
It depends on you.

1097
00:59:35,549 --> 00:59:36,758
It is an option. Yes.

1098
00:59:36,841 --> 00:59:37,884
Go to Guatemala.

1099
00:59:37,967 --> 00:59:40,220
- What ties you here?
- All right. Stop.

1100
00:59:40,304 --> 00:59:42,806
- Short the grass.
- Stop.

1101
00:59:42,889 --> 00:59:44,474
I do not want to fake my own death.

1102
00:59:44,558 --> 00:59:47,936
I'm just asking for ways
to raise this money.

1103
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:50,647
A good friend of mine made
$ 10,000 in two hours.

1104
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:52,816
- How?
- In las Vegas. He has abs.

1105
00:59:52,899 --> 00:59:55,319
- If we paint abs...
- Arthur, shut up.

1106
00:59:55,402 --> 00:59:56,778
I'm serious.

1107
00:59:56,861 --> 00:59:58,780
You have money.
We bought a package.

1108
00:59:58,863 --> 01:00:01,825
We fill it with talc and things
like that and we sell it.

1109
01:00:01,908 --> 01:00:04,228
We are not going to dedicate
ourselves to selling cocaine.

1110
01:00:04,286 --> 01:00:05,954
- Do you want to live or die?
- I...

1111
01:00:06,037 --> 01:00:07,622
What's wrong with selling Coca?

1112
01:00:08,415 --> 01:00:09,583
Nothing.

1113
01:00:09,666 --> 01:00:12,419
You sell them to executives from
the Chicago stock exchange.

1114
01:00:12,502 --> 01:00:14,213
Yes. Those guys are expendable.

1115
01:00:14,296 --> 01:00:16,173
Do not push it!

1116
01:00:16,256 --> 01:00:19,384
We are not going to sell Coca. Stop!

1117
01:00:19,468 --> 01:00:21,595
I need a realistic option.

1118
01:00:21,678 --> 01:00:23,347
- Come on the offensive.
- Agree.

1119
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:25,974
He bursts into his house. Come on.

1120
01:00:26,057 --> 01:00:28,393
- When he arrives at night.
- Good idea.

1121
01:00:28,477 --> 01:00:30,937
- It's the worst idea.
- Three rabbits in a row.

1122
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:34,316
- Dead. With blood on his face.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

1123
01:00:34,399 --> 01:00:36,568
Point out that you are a
worshiper of the devil.

1124
01:00:36,651 --> 01:00:40,071
Laugh, but it's the
best idea I've heard.

1125
01:00:40,154 --> 01:00:43,325
- The best that has come to us.
- If that's the best...

1126
01:00:43,408 --> 01:00:46,370
Make an application.
Those guys make a lot of money.

1127
01:00:48,288 --> 01:00:50,790
- An app?
- The business is saturated.

1128
01:00:50,874 --> 01:00:52,584
- What?
- The business is saturated.

1129
01:00:53,502 --> 01:00:54,836
What does that mean?

1130
01:00:54,919 --> 01:00:56,963
Too many people are making apps.

1131
01:00:57,046 --> 01:00:58,340
There are too many applications.

1132
01:00:59,258 --> 01:01:01,050
Make a good one.

1133
01:01:01,134 --> 01:01:03,595
Yes? How?

1134
01:01:03,678 --> 01:01:05,398
He does not know anything about technology.

1135
01:01:05,422 --> 01:01:07,140
- Cut the grass.
- It was an idea.

1136
01:01:07,224 --> 01:01:08,892
Make an application for that.

1137
01:01:09,809 --> 01:01:11,728
- What a good idea.
- Not bad.

1138
01:01:11,811 --> 01:01:13,230
- I like it.
- It is not good.

1139
01:01:24,199 --> 01:01:25,659
<i>- I'm screwed up!
- Good...</i>

1140
01:01:25,742 --> 01:01:27,994
- I hear you.
- I'm sorry, but I'm fucked.

1141
01:01:28,077 --> 01:01:29,078
Lower your voice.

1142
01:01:29,162 --> 01:01:30,497
- I hear you.
- Gene.

1143
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:32,081
- Listen to me.
- I hear you.

1144
01:01:32,165 --> 01:01:33,166
- Hears!
- I hear you.

1145
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:35,460
- I'm scared.
- I hear you, but lower your voice.

1146
01:01:35,544 --> 01:01:37,003
You must lower your voice, okay?

1147
01:01:37,086 --> 01:01:38,672
I have neighbors and a son.

1148
01:01:38,755 --> 01:01:40,173
You must lower your voice.

1149
01:01:40,257 --> 01:01:42,008
- And you must listen to me.
- I hear you.

1150
01:01:42,091 --> 01:01:44,469
- I did everything you said.
- Take it easy.

1151
01:01:44,553 --> 01:01:45,887
I'm calm.

1152
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:47,221
I'm calm? Yes.

1153
01:01:47,306 --> 01:01:48,598
- Just relax.
- Very good.

1154
01:01:48,682 --> 01:01:50,350
I did everything you said.

1155
01:01:50,434 --> 01:01:52,143
I did everything my brother said.

1156
01:01:52,226 --> 01:01:54,271
- I went to meetings.
- Damn it, Eddie.

1157
01:01:54,354 --> 01:01:56,856
But I've never been so fucked up before.

1158
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:59,526
And I need a plan b now.

1159
01:01:59,609 --> 01:02:04,656
Now, gene. I have no idea
and I am very scared.

1160
01:02:04,739 --> 01:02:06,199
Very good. Listen out.

1161
01:02:06,283 --> 01:02:10,579
Whatever the problem, it
will not get worse tonight.

1162
01:02:10,662 --> 01:02:12,914
It's 2:30 A.M. m. It will
not get any worse now.

1163
01:02:12,997 --> 01:02:14,874
I need something already.

1164
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:17,043
Now I can not give you anything.

1165
01:02:17,126 --> 01:02:21,089
I can not. I'll give it to you
tomorrow at the meeting. I promise.

1166
01:02:21,172 --> 01:02:23,132
- The fucking meeting.
- Fuck that.

1167
01:02:23,216 --> 01:02:24,593
No, fuck it. Look at me.

1168
01:02:24,676 --> 01:02:26,970
Fuck the meeting.
Call me at 7:00 A.M. m.

1169
01:02:27,053 --> 01:02:29,306
- And we'll think about it.
- I'm calling you now.

1170
01:02:29,389 --> 01:02:32,225
You can not call me now
because I have a son.

1171
01:02:32,309 --> 01:02:34,143
I have neighbors.
I can not get you inside.

1172
01:02:34,227 --> 01:02:35,269
- Good.
- Yes?

1173
01:02:35,354 --> 01:02:36,813
I have recomposed my life.

1174
01:02:36,896 --> 01:02:39,190
- I got it back.
- Agree.

1175
01:02:39,273 --> 01:02:40,473
- Yes? Listen out.
- All right.

1176
01:02:40,525 --> 01:02:41,568
- Listen out.
- All right.

1177
01:02:41,651 --> 01:02:43,945
Wait until the meeting

1178
01:02:44,029 --> 01:02:45,905
- and we fixed it.
- I'm sorry I came.

1179
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:47,115
I'm fine.

1180
01:02:49,368 --> 01:02:50,369
We are fine.

1181
01:03:23,902 --> 01:03:25,111
Hi, Eddie.

1182
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:30,867
- Do not!
- Shit, Eddie!

1183
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:32,744
- Do not!
- We gotta get you out, Eddie.

1184
01:03:32,827 --> 01:03:33,870
We must expel you.

1185
01:03:33,953 --> 01:03:34,954
- Two weeks.
- Do not!

1186
01:03:35,038 --> 01:03:36,540
- Stay away for two weeks.
- Do not!

1187
01:03:36,623 --> 01:03:38,207
- We gotta get you out, Eddie.
- Do not!

1188
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:39,709
Go home. You're drunk.

1189
01:03:39,793 --> 01:03:41,670
Eddie, get out of here.

1190
01:03:41,753 --> 01:03:43,672
- Come back in two weeks!
- Do not!

1191
01:03:43,755 --> 01:03:45,173
Yes? Get out of here.

1192
01:03:45,256 --> 01:03:46,800
Get out of here. You're drunk.

1193
01:03:46,883 --> 01:03:48,468
Go home. Eddie.

1194
01:03:48,552 --> 01:03:50,344
Go home.

1195
01:03:50,429 --> 01:03:52,180
- Fuck off.
- Long.

1196
01:03:52,263 --> 01:03:53,473
Fuck off! Yes.

1197
01:04:13,034 --> 01:04:14,494
What do you think? Eddie

1198
01:04:15,579 --> 01:04:16,580
Eddie.

1199
01:04:18,206 --> 01:04:19,373
Eddie, can you hear me?

1200
01:04:21,626 --> 01:04:23,044
What was he talking about?

1201
01:04:25,171 --> 01:04:26,380
To have dinner together.

1202
01:04:27,131 --> 01:04:28,132
Yes.

1203
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:30,510
- I would love to.
- With Emma?

1204
01:04:30,594 --> 01:04:31,970
Yes.

1205
01:04:32,053 --> 01:04:33,053
When?

1206
01:04:34,347 --> 01:04:35,724
Weekend.

1207
01:04:35,807 --> 01:04:36,891
East? Yes.

1208
01:04:36,975 --> 01:04:38,267
When? What a night?

1209
01:04:39,227 --> 01:04:40,228
On Sunday.

1210
01:04:40,311 --> 01:04:42,647
All right. What time?

1211
01:04:42,731 --> 01:04:44,941
- For dinner.
- Tell me to what time.

1212
01:04:45,024 --> 01:04:46,109
- Hour.
- At 7:00?

1213
01:04:46,192 --> 01:04:47,193
- At 7:00.
- Maybe.

1214
01:04:47,276 --> 01:04:49,446
- Well, I'll be there at...
- You want?

1215
01:04:49,529 --> 01:04:50,989
Yes, of course I want.

1216
01:04:51,072 --> 01:04:52,866
- I'm dying to meet her.
- Very good.

1217
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:54,659
What good news.

1218
01:04:54,743 --> 01:04:56,786
I'm excited too. Will be great.

1219
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:58,162
It seems perfect.

1220
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:01,500
- Very good.
- I'm impatient.

1221
01:05:02,291 --> 01:05:03,918
It's good that you had that time.

1222
01:05:04,002 --> 01:05:05,920
Yes, it was great. Yes.

1223
01:05:06,004 --> 01:05:07,005
- Yes.
- Fabulous.

1224
01:05:07,088 --> 01:05:08,131
Take care.

1225
01:05:08,214 --> 01:05:09,716
- Nice to see you.
- Bye.

1226
01:05:09,799 --> 01:05:11,175
- Beware.
- I'm glad to see you.

1227
01:05:11,259 --> 01:05:12,260
Very good.

1228
01:05:15,722 --> 01:05:16,973
Are you hungry?

1229
01:05:18,517 --> 01:05:20,727
- Yes.
- Let's go from here.

1230
01:05:20,810 --> 01:05:22,250
Yes.
We are going to eat something.

1231
01:05:22,896 --> 01:05:23,897
Yes?

1232
01:05:24,814 --> 01:05:28,485
I must say that I like to have a job.

1233
01:05:28,568 --> 01:05:31,613
I like to go up in that company.

1234
01:05:31,696 --> 01:05:33,072
I like having a girlfriend.

1235
01:05:33,156 --> 01:05:35,408
I like to feel like an adult.

1236
01:05:35,492 --> 01:05:37,243
And not as if he were a degenerate.

1237
01:05:38,161 --> 01:05:40,539
I do not wanna bet.
I do not feel the need.

1238
01:05:40,622 --> 01:05:41,915
I do not want to be...

1239
01:05:42,832 --> 01:05:44,333
I do not want to be in that world.

1240
01:05:44,417 --> 01:05:47,671
And even if I wanted to, I could not
because I can not go to my casino.

1241
01:05:47,754 --> 01:05:49,130
I was forbidden to enter.

1242
01:05:49,672 --> 01:05:53,510
I do not know how, but I have to earn
all that money before Monday and...

1243
01:05:54,594 --> 01:05:56,054
I'm lost, gene.

1244
01:06:02,852 --> 01:06:03,853
Agree.

1245
01:06:05,146 --> 01:06:07,148
I'll tell you right now.

1246
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:10,193
The worst thing a godfather can tell you.

1247
01:06:13,112 --> 01:06:16,032
There's a game I can get you into.

1248
01:06:17,283 --> 01:06:19,786
It's my old game.
The stakes are very strong.

1249
01:06:20,912 --> 01:06:23,372
You can make lots of money very fast.

1250
01:06:24,373 --> 01:06:27,460
But you can also
lose much as fast.

1251
01:06:27,544 --> 01:06:28,837
Yes?

1252
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,254
I must tell you.

1253
01:06:30,338 --> 01:06:33,717
Believe me that, from what you told me,

1254
01:06:34,508 --> 01:06:38,096
if you lose, you will
have to leave the city.

1255
01:06:38,179 --> 01:06:39,764
Do not... yes.

1256
01:06:39,931 --> 01:06:41,808
Do not go through the exit box.

1257
01:06:41,891 --> 01:06:43,184
Do not go to your house.

1258
01:06:43,267 --> 01:06:44,894
- Very good.
- Go away.

1259
01:06:47,731 --> 01:06:49,608
I guess I'm telling you...

1260
01:06:51,943 --> 01:06:53,111
You know...

1261
01:06:54,028 --> 01:06:56,615
If you want me to call, I will.

1262
01:06:58,783 --> 01:07:00,368
Call. Yes.

1263
01:07:00,451 --> 01:07:03,747
- I do not see what other option...
- I do not want to, but call.

1264
01:07:04,706 --> 01:07:05,706
Yes.

1265
01:07:28,396 --> 01:07:30,356
It looks like a scary picture.

1266
01:07:30,439 --> 01:07:31,565
Where we are?

1267
01:07:32,191 --> 01:07:35,569
In the residential area.
We left the city.

1268
01:07:35,654 --> 01:07:37,030
This is very scary.

1269
01:07:37,113 --> 01:07:39,157
When we enter,

1270
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:42,368
you will be my collector, my muscle.

1271
01:07:42,451 --> 01:07:44,120
- Yes.
- It is important.

1272
01:07:44,203 --> 01:07:46,164
That you always stay to my right.

1273
01:07:46,247 --> 01:07:48,374
And hold the bag.

1274
01:07:48,457 --> 01:07:50,543
When I go get money, you give it to me.

1275
01:07:50,627 --> 01:07:52,295
It must flow very well.

1276
01:07:52,378 --> 01:07:54,047
Many guys will have one.

1277
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:57,216
It is important that it seems
that we have done it before.

1278
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:58,780
- Very good. Yes.
- Do you understand?

1279
01:07:59,552 --> 01:08:02,138
We look like the men in black.

1280
01:08:02,221 --> 01:08:04,849
Now I have doubts.
I do not want to be a man in black.

1281
01:08:04,933 --> 01:08:07,226
We dressed smart.
We know what we do.

1282
01:08:07,310 --> 01:08:08,812
Do not say that in there.

1283
01:08:10,354 --> 01:08:11,856
I do not want them to think about it.

1284
01:08:16,444 --> 01:08:19,155
Tomorrow at 7:00 I have a dinner.

1285
01:08:19,238 --> 01:08:21,449
We have 24 hours to earn that money.

1286
01:08:22,367 --> 01:08:29,040
Grand appliances and TV.

1287
01:08:33,127 --> 01:08:34,337
I feel good.

1288
01:08:58,569 --> 01:08:59,738
Proof. Yes.

1289
01:09:03,532 --> 01:09:04,575
Hi.

1290
01:09:26,848 --> 01:09:29,142
- They're just appliances.
- I already know it.

1291
01:09:38,651 --> 01:09:39,986
I have no idea.

1292
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:42,781
Yes.

1293
01:09:54,417 --> 01:09:55,417
Eddie Garrett.

1294
01:09:56,335 --> 01:09:58,880
- Who is he?
- My collector.

1295
01:09:58,963 --> 01:10:01,382
- What is a collector?
- You do not know?

1296
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:03,885
The one who takes all my money.

1297
01:10:03,968 --> 01:10:05,804
We do not have anyone else on the list.

1298
01:10:06,888 --> 01:10:08,139
Come on, man.

1299
01:10:08,222 --> 01:10:09,766
We drove from the city.

1300
01:10:09,849 --> 01:10:11,100
I thought I might come in.

1301
01:10:11,184 --> 01:10:12,185
Come on.

1302
01:10:13,144 --> 01:10:14,187
Thank you.

1303
01:10:17,148 --> 01:10:20,026
Hi. They want to drink something.

1304
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:21,694
Yes. A whiskey.

1305
01:10:39,963 --> 01:10:41,505
They play hold'em, right?

1306
01:10:41,589 --> 01:10:42,882
Yes it is.

1307
01:10:42,966 --> 01:10:45,509
Why at that table?
It should be in the long run.

1308
01:10:46,427 --> 01:10:47,636
The owner decided.

1309
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:50,181
But it's not a hold'em table.
It's strange, is not it?

1310
01:10:50,264 --> 01:10:52,475
I don't know. It is the
table that the owner likes.

1311
01:10:53,601 --> 01:10:55,019
I would not worry.

1312
01:10:55,103 --> 01:10:58,064
I do not worry, but it's
not a hold'em table.

1313
01:10:58,147 --> 01:10:59,273
There is a free place.

1314
01:10:59,357 --> 01:11:00,358
Yes.

1315
01:11:08,825 --> 01:11:10,493
- Do it fast.
- It's $ 500.

1316
01:11:10,576 --> 01:11:11,577
Are they dollars?

1317
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:13,246
- Five.
- Yens.

1318
01:11:13,329 --> 01:11:14,455
All right. Bet.

1319
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:17,708
The blues brothers!

1320
01:11:18,877 --> 01:11:20,461
They still owe you money.

1321
01:11:21,689 --> 01:11:22,689
Very good.

1322
01:11:22,713 --> 01:11:24,549
- I like your shoes.
- Thank you.

1323
01:11:24,632 --> 01:11:25,633
It's 15.

1324
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:27,676
It's $ 15,000.

1325
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:29,888
The bet is $ 15,000.

1326
01:11:30,679 --> 01:11:32,039
I thought there were five of them.

1327
01:11:32,063 --> 01:11:33,141
Not tonight.

1328
01:11:33,224 --> 01:11:34,893
- Fifteen.
- Are they 15?

1329
01:11:34,976 --> 01:11:35,976
Game for adults.

1330
01:11:36,477 --> 01:11:39,730
- We played like that the last 24 hours.
- All right. Save me the seat.

1331
01:11:47,363 --> 01:11:49,073
They say that they are 15.

1332
01:11:49,157 --> 01:11:50,824
Fifteen more, or in total?

1333
01:11:50,909 --> 01:11:52,785
- What?
- Fifteen more or 15 in total?

1334
01:11:52,869 --> 01:11:56,455
They said that... I already put
five, so there are ten more.

1335
01:11:56,539 --> 01:11:58,582
- Very good.
- And they act like imbeciles.

1336
01:11:58,666 --> 01:12:00,793
Guy said something about
the blues brothers.

1337
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:03,880
- Do you want us to leave?
- Do not.

1338
01:12:03,963 --> 01:12:05,589
I will not leave now.

1339
01:12:05,673 --> 01:12:07,216
Get your hands off.

1340
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:09,385
I can not spend so much time doing this.

1341
01:12:09,468 --> 01:12:12,180
Besides, you should have everything ready.

1342
01:12:12,263 --> 01:12:13,806
It is part of the matter.

1343
01:12:14,848 --> 01:12:16,142
The guy runs like a god.

1344
01:12:17,601 --> 01:12:18,686
Tokens, please.

1345
01:12:18,769 --> 01:12:20,438
He also lies now.

1346
01:12:23,274 --> 01:12:24,943
- Yes.
- You lied to that?

1347
01:12:25,026 --> 01:12:26,945
- It's $ 15,000. Luck.
- Thank you.

1348
01:12:27,028 --> 01:12:28,821
- Yes.
- Well done.

1349
01:12:28,905 --> 01:12:30,907
You can cut your hair with that money.

1350
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:32,700
Pitbull is not joking.

1351
01:12:34,953 --> 01:12:36,495
Welcome, sir. Yes.

1352
01:12:37,413 --> 01:12:39,749
- I'm Brad.
- Hello. I am Eddie. Charmed.

1353
01:12:39,832 --> 01:12:42,168
- The chips and the money.
- Small, big.

1354
01:12:48,716 --> 01:12:50,426
- How much is it?
- At $ 1,750.

1355
01:12:51,177 --> 01:12:52,428
Equal.

1356
01:12:55,348 --> 01:12:56,432
I go up.

1357
01:12:56,515 --> 01:12:57,808
It is cheaper to retire.

1358
01:12:58,517 --> 01:13:00,019
If you retire, you do not win.

1359
01:13:03,897 --> 01:13:05,066
All right, I'm leaving.

1360
01:13:08,277 --> 01:13:11,447
- Small, big?
- You had a four. It was no use.

1361
01:13:12,656 --> 01:13:14,492
- Did you have a king?
- Do not.

1362
01:13:14,575 --> 01:13:16,285
With a partner, you had the best hand.

1363
01:13:16,369 --> 01:13:18,454
I had it. Shit.

1364
01:13:20,706 --> 01:13:22,041
They are good letters.

1365
01:13:22,125 --> 01:13:23,334
Thank my lord.

1366
01:13:24,252 --> 01:13:25,378
<i>Straddle?</i>

1367
01:13:25,461 --> 01:13:26,712
Yes.

1368
01:13:26,795 --> 01:13:28,131
Let them be $ 1,000.

1369
01:13:29,966 --> 01:13:31,342
Well, we have a well.

1370
01:13:33,261 --> 01:13:35,221
It has to be a joke.

1371
01:13:37,306 --> 01:13:38,306
I retire.

1372
01:13:40,101 --> 01:13:41,269
<i>Can I enter the end?</i>

1373
01:13:41,352 --> 01:13:42,478
- Clear.
- All right.

1374
01:13:44,813 --> 01:13:45,813
Fifteen, Nick.

1375
01:13:46,774 --> 01:13:47,816
Fifteen fewer.

1376
01:13:50,278 --> 01:13:51,612
- Ten.
- Very good.

1377
01:13:51,695 --> 01:13:53,281
The bet is $ 700.

1378
01:13:53,364 --> 01:13:54,365
That's five.

1379
01:13:55,283 --> 01:13:56,284
Records!

1380
01:13:56,367 --> 01:13:57,410
Fifteen.

1381
01:14:01,164 --> 01:14:02,498
It's $ 15,000. Good luck, sir.

1382
01:14:02,581 --> 01:14:03,582
Thank my lord.

1383
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:05,751
I'm going with $ 4,000.

1384
01:14:07,961 --> 01:14:09,297
$ 4,000? Yes.

1385
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:11,132
- $ 4,000.
- $ 4,000.

1386
01:14:14,385 --> 01:14:15,636
It is a very good card.

1387
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:18,139
I'll go ahead and bet whatever it is.

1388
01:14:18,222 --> 01:14:19,307
What is that?

1389
01:14:20,266 --> 01:14:22,935
Are you betting on some logic?

1390
01:14:23,019 --> 01:14:24,228
Or simply...?

1391
01:14:24,312 --> 01:14:25,688
You bet on everything? Yes.

1392
01:14:25,771 --> 01:14:28,732
Do not you even think?
You throw a coin in the air.

1393
01:14:29,650 --> 01:14:31,735
Two for $ 10,000.

1394
01:14:31,819 --> 01:14:34,322
Do not fuck with me.

1395
01:14:35,323 --> 01:14:36,740
You do not have a queen.

1396
01:14:37,533 --> 01:14:38,909
Find out for $ 10,000.

1397
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:43,330
I go with everything.

1398
01:14:43,997 --> 01:14:44,998
All.

1399
01:14:48,377 --> 01:14:49,378
I cover it.

1400
01:14:51,047 --> 01:14:52,631
- Let's see.
- By...

1401
01:14:55,343 --> 01:14:56,635
- I am sorry.
- Good hand.

1402
01:14:57,678 --> 01:14:58,721
Save me the seat.

1403
01:14:59,597 --> 01:15:00,764
Seat saved.

1404
01:15:10,066 --> 01:15:11,525
Motherfucker.

1405
01:15:13,944 --> 01:15:18,282
They are playing like crazy, and I do
not want to toss one coin at a time.

1406
01:15:18,366 --> 01:15:19,825
I can not do it.

1407
01:15:20,576 --> 01:15:22,453
I'm too scared.

1408
01:15:32,296 --> 01:15:34,507
If I had known, I would not have come.

1409
01:15:37,301 --> 01:15:39,011
Damn... this is...

1410
01:15:40,596 --> 01:15:41,597
So...

1411
01:15:43,474 --> 01:15:44,600
I have to flee.

1412
01:15:45,935 --> 01:15:48,896
I must leave the city.
I have money to start.

1413
01:15:49,438 --> 01:15:51,607
I do not know where the
fuck I'm going to go.

1414
01:16:04,787 --> 01:16:07,498
<i>Hi, Eddie, it's Emma.</i>

1415
01:16:07,581 --> 01:16:10,959
<i>My mom and I...
Well, technically, my mom...</i>

1416
01:16:12,837 --> 01:16:15,256
<i>Ask if you prefer chicken or steak.</i>

1417
01:16:15,839 --> 01:16:18,592
<i>I want to meet you.</i>

1418
01:16:20,678 --> 01:16:23,222
<i>Send me a message, okay?
Tell me what you prefer.</i>

1419
01:16:24,223 --> 01:16:26,309
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

1420
01:16:46,287 --> 01:16:47,621
Let's play the cards.

1421
01:17:01,719 --> 01:17:03,221
Tokens, please!

1422
01:17:03,304 --> 01:17:04,930
- How many?
- A lot!

1423
01:17:08,184 --> 01:17:10,018
He is Jamie. It is at your service.

1424
01:17:10,603 --> 01:17:12,313
Jamie! "How are you, knight?"

1425
01:17:16,275 --> 01:17:17,360
I walk up and up.

1426
01:17:23,782 --> 01:17:25,659
If Stan bet, me too.

1427
01:17:27,661 --> 01:17:29,830
I told you. King, nine.
That gave you problems.

1428
01:17:29,913 --> 01:17:31,249
That's why I smiled.

1429
01:17:34,126 --> 01:17:36,044
Very good. I'm going to take a break.

1430
01:17:36,128 --> 01:17:37,505
Brian will replace me. Luck.

1431
01:17:40,466 --> 01:17:41,675
This is for you.

1432
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:43,802
- Health.
- Health.

1433
01:17:49,933 --> 01:17:51,852
I had a ladder.

1434
01:17:56,899 --> 01:17:58,234
You should retire.

1435
01:18:05,324 --> 01:18:06,450
Do you walk or bet?

1436
01:18:14,166 --> 01:18:15,167
He passed.

1437
01:18:16,084 --> 01:18:17,253
The Ace is here.

1438
01:18:22,466 --> 01:18:23,467
He passed.

1439
01:18:24,385 --> 01:18:25,594
You are next.

1440
01:18:31,224 --> 01:18:32,310
We must see it.

1441
01:18:32,393 --> 01:18:33,602
- Let's see.
- You want?

1442
01:18:34,562 --> 01:18:35,854
Take it off.

1443
01:18:35,938 --> 01:18:37,523
Check it out.

1444
01:18:39,107 --> 01:18:40,734
How sensual.

1445
01:18:41,652 --> 01:18:44,237
- Yes!
- Come on!

1446
01:18:44,321 --> 01:18:46,532
- I win! The highest color!
- And the last!

1447
01:18:47,533 --> 01:18:48,701
Yes!

1448
01:18:48,784 --> 01:18:52,913
Of doses and tens...
- Amazing. - Shit!

1449
01:18:53,914 --> 01:18:55,291
Yes. I got the lost back.

1450
01:18:55,374 --> 01:18:56,374
I did it.

1451
01:18:56,959 --> 01:18:58,419
I did it. That time was $ 6,000.

1452
01:18:58,502 --> 01:19:01,130
- Let's move on.
- I've got 100 more. I did it, shit!

1453
01:19:01,213 --> 01:19:02,923
You should have seen that hand.

1454
01:19:03,006 --> 01:19:05,426
I made them dust.

1455
01:19:05,509 --> 01:19:07,010
Let's move on. Take the money.
Yes.

1456
01:19:07,094 --> 01:19:08,637
I find it hard to breathe.

1457
01:19:09,513 --> 01:19:10,639
- Ray...
- What?

1458
01:19:10,723 --> 01:19:11,974
- If I were...
- Let's move on.

1459
01:19:12,057 --> 01:19:13,517
Yes I go. Hold on. One second.

1460
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,602
- Give him his money.
- Do not!

1461
01:19:15,686 --> 01:19:16,937
Wait. I did not say that.

1462
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:18,063
- Do not...
- I enter.

1463
01:19:18,146 --> 01:19:19,666
- It will be right back.
- Cover it up.

1464
01:19:19,690 --> 01:19:21,484
- I feel strange.
- Let's move on. You did.

1465
01:19:21,567 --> 01:19:22,735
We have a lot of money.

1466
01:19:22,818 --> 01:19:23,819
Give him the money.

1467
01:19:23,902 --> 01:19:25,153
Wait. Do not! I did not say...

1468
01:19:25,237 --> 01:19:27,531
- Wait! I do not want to go out.
- Give it...

1469
01:19:27,615 --> 01:19:29,867
I do not want...
Hears. It's over.

1470
01:19:29,950 --> 01:19:31,744
It is a mistake that I leave now.

1471
01:19:31,827 --> 01:19:33,120
I'm serious.

1472
01:19:33,203 --> 01:19:34,330
- Two more hands.
- Do not.

1473
01:19:34,413 --> 01:19:36,374
I play a couple more. If I lose...

1474
01:19:36,457 --> 01:19:38,751
- Come on.
- I feel like I have...

1475
01:19:38,834 --> 01:19:40,336
- You have the money.
- I know.

1476
01:19:40,419 --> 01:19:42,921
And I have 100 more.

1477
01:19:43,005 --> 01:19:46,216
So I play until...
Just a moment.

1478
01:19:46,299 --> 01:19:47,843
- Shit.
- Are you crazy.

1479
01:19:47,926 --> 01:19:49,345
- I had...
- Give it...

1480
01:19:51,764 --> 01:19:53,223
Give him the money.

1481
01:19:53,306 --> 01:19:56,226
He's giving me a heart attack.

1482
01:19:56,309 --> 01:19:57,936
He's giving me a heart attack!

1483
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:00,356
It hurts a lot, shit!

1484
01:20:00,439 --> 01:20:01,439
I'm dying.

1485
01:20:02,024 --> 01:20:03,859
Help me, I'm dying.

1486
01:20:03,942 --> 01:20:05,778
Can you call 911?

1487
01:20:07,154 --> 01:20:08,406
Give her your money!

1488
01:20:27,841 --> 01:20:28,967
Do not die.

1489
01:20:29,051 --> 01:20:30,928
Please! Faster!

1490
01:20:31,011 --> 01:20:33,180
I can not exceed 80 km /
h in this neighborhood.

1491
01:20:33,263 --> 01:20:35,348
I do not want to die!

1492
01:20:36,016 --> 01:20:38,185
Not yet!

1493
01:20:39,645 --> 01:20:41,772
Do not!

1494
01:20:42,690 --> 01:20:46,485
Do not!

1495
01:20:55,035 --> 01:20:56,995
Heavens.

1496
01:20:57,788 --> 01:20:59,164
How are you?

1497
01:20:59,247 --> 01:21:00,958
All right. I mean...

1498
01:21:01,667 --> 01:21:02,876
You will be fine.

1499
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,169
They say you'll get well.

1500
01:21:04,252 --> 01:21:05,421
- Yes?
- You're good.

1501
01:21:05,504 --> 01:21:07,548
I'm fine? Yes.

1502
01:21:07,631 --> 01:21:09,007
All right. Nicky told me.

1503
01:21:09,466 --> 01:21:11,718
I'm not that person anymore.

1504
01:21:11,802 --> 01:21:14,805
I swear, I'm not like that anymore.

1505
01:21:14,888 --> 01:21:16,014
I know.

1506
01:21:16,098 --> 01:21:19,977
- Really, it's not like before.
- Agree.

1507
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:22,855
I want to go to work
and enter the company.

1508
01:21:22,938 --> 01:21:24,815
And so it will be.

1509
01:21:24,898 --> 01:21:26,483
- I'm sorry.
- Really?

1510
01:21:26,567 --> 01:21:27,818
- If it is okay.
- All right.

1511
01:21:27,901 --> 01:21:30,153
Do you say it because I'm in the hospital?

1512
01:21:30,237 --> 01:21:31,238
Maybe a little.

1513
01:21:31,321 --> 01:21:33,115
Because the robe suits you.

1514
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:34,741
I'm taking you by the hair

1515
01:21:35,117 --> 01:21:36,869
I'm serious. That's me.

1516
01:21:36,952 --> 01:21:39,621
You're good. Everything is fine, okay?

1517
01:21:39,705 --> 01:21:40,873
I'm glad you're back.

1518
01:21:42,374 --> 01:21:44,334
- Do you know what time it is?
- 6:30.

1519
01:21:47,337 --> 01:21:50,382
- What's going on?
- Can you give me my phone?

1520
01:21:50,466 --> 01:21:52,593
I must call Eva.
I should see her at 7:00.

1521
01:21:52,676 --> 01:21:53,969
Today I will meet your daughter.

1522
01:21:54,052 --> 01:21:55,095
The phone was not there.

1523
01:21:55,178 --> 01:21:57,222
They are the wallet, the
keys and the chain.

1524
01:21:57,306 --> 01:21:58,640
But not the phone.

1525
01:22:00,142 --> 01:22:02,269
- It's okay.
- Not well.

1526
01:22:02,352 --> 01:22:05,606
I call it. Is nothing. Just relax.
Do not give you another attack. I call her.

1527
01:22:07,733 --> 01:22:08,859
What is your number?

1528
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:12,738
I do not know by heart.

1529
01:22:12,821 --> 01:22:14,447
- Do not?
- It's on my phone.

1530
01:22:14,532 --> 01:22:16,324
Do not you remember her number?

1531
01:22:16,408 --> 01:22:18,619
- What's wrong?
- This is not the time to bother me.

1532
01:22:18,702 --> 01:22:21,497
I remember my girlfriend's high
school number. I am sorry.

1533
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:24,583
- I can take. Come on.
- We have to go now.

1534
01:22:24,667 --> 01:22:27,044
- Right now.
- We'll be late anyway.

1535
01:22:27,127 --> 01:22:29,922
Careless. We're leaving.
I carry you. You're going to look elegant.

1536
01:22:30,005 --> 01:22:32,758
- Leave the gown.
- I'm not going to leave it to me.

1537
01:22:32,841 --> 01:22:34,217
- Leave her alone.
- Do not.

1538
01:22:34,301 --> 01:22:35,803
Well, right there. Yes.

1539
01:22:35,886 --> 01:22:37,262
Perfect.

1540
01:22:37,345 --> 01:22:39,640
Hey, Ron. Thank you.

1541
01:22:39,723 --> 01:22:41,308
- I love you.
- And I to you.

1542
01:22:41,391 --> 01:22:43,060
- Very good.
- Very good.

1543
01:23:11,004 --> 01:23:12,324
- I will explain you.
- Seriously?

1544
01:23:12,381 --> 01:23:14,633
- Let me explain you.
- You're 45 minutes late.

1545
01:23:14,717 --> 01:23:16,343
I did not want to be late.

1546
01:23:16,426 --> 01:23:17,595
- I called you...
- I know.

1547
01:23:17,678 --> 01:23:19,638
But I did not have the phone.

1548
01:23:19,722 --> 01:23:21,890
My phone was in one
place, and I in another.

1549
01:23:21,974 --> 01:23:23,391
- No more excuses.
- I do not...

1550
01:23:23,475 --> 01:23:25,310
He had a heart attack.

1551
01:23:25,393 --> 01:23:27,395
- What?
- He had a heart attack.

1552
01:23:27,479 --> 01:23:29,940
I had... I had a problem with the heart,

1553
01:23:30,023 --> 01:23:32,201
I fell to the ground and
was taken to the hospital.

1554
01:23:32,213 --> 01:23:32,943
Oh, my god.

1555
01:23:33,026 --> 01:23:34,277
Here is the proof.

1556
01:23:34,361 --> 01:23:35,654
- Yes.
- You're good?

1557
01:23:35,738 --> 01:23:37,072
Physically I'm fine.

1558
01:23:37,155 --> 01:23:39,116
- I must follow up...
- Enters.

1559
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:40,242
Missing analysis.

1560
01:23:40,325 --> 01:23:41,702
- Do not...
- Tell me later.

1561
01:23:41,785 --> 01:23:44,622
Agree. But no...
- Agree. - Good.

1562
01:23:44,705 --> 01:23:47,833
- Look who's here.
- Here they are. Hello!

1563
01:23:47,916 --> 01:23:49,209
- Hello.
- How are you?

1564
01:23:49,292 --> 01:23:50,711
Nice to meet you.

1565
01:23:50,794 --> 01:23:52,129
Equally.

1566
01:23:52,212 --> 01:23:54,131
I heard you speak very well. Yes.

1567
01:23:54,214 --> 01:23:55,215
Thank you.

1568
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,136
- How are you?
- Fine and you?

1569
01:23:59,219 --> 01:24:01,263
- Nice to meet you.
- Equally.

1570
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:03,932
I was dying to meet you.

1571
01:24:04,016 --> 01:24:06,727
Did you die? I'm dying to meet you.

1572
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:10,814
I've wanted to meet you for a long time.
I can not believe I'm seeing you.

1573
01:24:10,898 --> 01:24:13,191
It's great for me. Thank you.

1574
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:20,157
Do I sit here? Yes.

1575
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:21,449
Very good.

1576
01:25:29,267 --> 01:25:30,518
There's $ 400 more.

1577
01:25:31,978 --> 01:25:32,978
What?

1578
01:25:33,230 --> 01:25:35,065
It's all money.
I counted it twice.

1579
01:25:35,148 --> 01:25:37,400
But there are $ 400 more.

1580
01:25:38,485 --> 01:25:39,527
How?

1581
01:25:39,611 --> 01:25:40,971
- I do not know.
- How it happened?

1582
01:25:41,029 --> 01:25:42,030
Has no sense.

1583
01:25:42,114 --> 01:25:43,490
<i>If you like, I'll tell you again.</i>

1584
01:25:43,573 --> 01:25:45,367
<i>- Yes, tell it again.
- Very good.</i>

1585
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:46,744
<i>Fuck, man.</i>

1585
01:25:47,305 --> 01:26:47,247
