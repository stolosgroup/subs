2
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,116
Hey, hey, hey!

3
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,760
What the fuck?

4
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,031
Wait! I gotta call it in!

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,035
Move it!

6
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,075
Hey!

7
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,079
Bobby, you hear me?

8
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,319
Right there, motherfucker!

9
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,839
Please.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,831
Just fucking stop, man!

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,513
Just put the gun down!

12
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,796
Come on.

13
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,995
Please.

14
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,598
I'm fucking begging you.

15
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,354
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

16
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,000
I wasn't even...

17
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,759
Worse on Friday
Died on Saturday

18
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,035
Buried on Sunday

19
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,959
That was the end
Of Solomon Grundy

Solomon Grundy
Born on a Monday

21
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,478
Christened on Tuesday

22
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,950
Justine, please.

23
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,233
It's called "stimming,"
self-stimulation.

24
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,912
Whereas you and I might tap our fingers,

25
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,548
grind our teeth, bite our nails,

26
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,478
your son rocks back and forth.

27
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,433
It's more obvious, but perfectly natural.

28
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,076
We came here because
we heard you specialized in...

29
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,117
What is it? What does he have?

30
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,919
I'm not a fan of labels, ma'am.

31
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,273
Your son is a remarkable young man.

32
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,193
Who goes crazy
when you turn the vacuum on.

33
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,432
He wears one T-shirt,
won't let you hug him.

34
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,431
Loud noises, bright lights

35
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,910
can be especially difficult
for someone like your son.

36
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,317
The shirt, most likely fabric sensitivity.

37
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,597
Hugging,
closeness, touching...

38
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
Justine, no shoes today.

39
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,656
That can be a challenge, yes.

40
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,520
When it's somebody else's child,

41
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,198
it's a challenge.

42
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,358
When it's yours,

43
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,794
it's a problem.

44
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,678
My practice focuses on education.

45
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,308
I'd like to work with your son,
at his speed.

46
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,196
Help him develop the skills
he'll need to lead a full life.

47
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,118
Communicating, eye contact,

48
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,231
understanding non-verbal cues,

49
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,833
making friends.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,798
The only friend
he has is his little brother.

51
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,313
I'm sure moving from base to base
hasn 't helped.

52
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,993
My husband's in the Army,
which means we all are.

53
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,152
Would you be willing to let your son
stay with us for the summer

54
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,915
free of charge, working with me
in a sensory-friendly environment?

55
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,718
That's not gonna happen.

56
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,988
If loud noises and bright lights
bother him,

57
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,549
he needs more of it, not less.

58
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,357
The world is not
a sensory-friendly place,

59
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,676
and that's where
he needs to learn to live.

60
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,748
Not in here.

61
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,033
Doctor, in your opinion,

62
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,393
can our son lead a normal life?

63
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,236
Define normal.

64
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,511
I need to finish! I need to finish!

Buried on Sunday

75
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,720
Hmm. Mmm.

76
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,072
I, uh... I never thought of myself
as a quitter... Fourth-generation farmer.

77
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,629
But between the property taxes

78
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,754
and the fertilizer costs, and insurance...

79
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,075
Oh, to hell with it.

80
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,635
What if, just temporarily, mind you,

81
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,633
we put this year's taxes
on our credit card?

82
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,359
Do you like it?

83
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,873
I made it myself.

84
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,598
No, not particularly.

85
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,959
But do you ever sell them?

86
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,599
At church fairs now and again.

87
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,712
Mrs. Rice, you may have what the IRS
calls a "home-based business."

88
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,040
What room do you use in your house
when you make those?

89
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,195
I don't, really.

90
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,998
Just wherever I happen to be, I guess.

91
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,628
In front of the TV,
at the kitchen table.

92
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,176
I like to spread my beads out
in the dining room, but Frank gets...

93
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,475
Yes, it would be better
if you could try to remember

94
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,949
the one specific space that you use.

95
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,316
Your home is 2,913 square feet.

96
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,478
IRS code allows us to deduct
from your taxable income

97
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,313
a percentage of your workspace
relative to your overall home.

98
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,640
- What...
- Mr. Rice...

99
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,518
How big is your dining room?

100
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,388
Mrs. Rice's office.

101
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,880
I wouldn't
so much as call it an office...

102
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,440
Oh.

103
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,395
It's, uh, approximately 200, uh...

104
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,996
Well, make it 300 square feet.

105
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,673
Excellent. Mrs. Rice...

106
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,909
Dolores.

107
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,436
Dolores, when you order supplies,
do you order online?

108
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,989
I don't. I just zip on over
to the bead store.

109
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,388
Zip?

110
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,148
I drive the truck.

111
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,558
The company truck.

112
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,349
Come in.

113
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,656
Mr. King, you have wandered

114
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,272
so far outside your legal purview.

115
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,998
As president of Southern Gulf Bank,

116
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,720
I intend to protect
my customers' privacy...

117
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,915
Stop talking.

118
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,520
You have a very cavalier attitude
for the president of a bank,

119
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,080
with such a piss-poor capital cushion.

120
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,716
Now, I want a record of every transaction
Abayed has had for the past two years.

121
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,553
Deposits, withdrawals,
cashier's checks, credit cards.

122
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,871
Birmingham or Bahrain,
it is now Treasury business.

123
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,393
Goodbye.

124
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,073
Medina.

125
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,593
Am I saying that correctly?

126
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,875
Medina, yes, sir.

127
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,238
I've read all your case files,
Director King.

128
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,073
It's impressive work. Very.

129
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,391
Marybeth Ascension Medina.

130
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,915
Graduated University of Baltimore
cum laude

131
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,116
with a degree in criminal justice.

132
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,831
Two years Baltimore PD as an analyst,
two more at Homeland, analyst again,

133
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,789
and the last five years here at Treasury.

134
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,154
Analyst.

135
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,676
You did the heavy lifting
on Agent Lorenz's case last month.

136
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,431
I worked on it, yeah, but Agent Lorenz...

137
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,273
Why haven't you applied
for promotion to agent?

138
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,273
You're already doing the work.

139
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,918
Analyst is a good fit.

140
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,112
And I enjoy the work, so...

141
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,672
Well, you're a liar, Medina.

142
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,393
Ward of the state of Maryland's

143
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,835
foster care
and juvenile detention systems

144
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,116
from age 11 to 18.

145
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,272
Weapons charges, assault and battery.

146
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,189
Ouch.

147
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,191
Attempted murder.

148
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,558
Those records were sealed.

149
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,552
Is that a nine millimeter?

150
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,629
.45.

151
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,156
You better sit your ass
back down in that chair, young lady.

152
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,150
This is a big moment for you.

153
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,237
Make a good choice.

154
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,314
Lying on a federal employment application
is a felony.

155
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,997
So right now, I'm the only thing standing
between you and significant prison time.

156
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,157
What do you want?

157
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,992
Do you like puzzles, Marybeth Medina?

158
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,511
I meant what I said, son.
You're welcome out to the place anytime.

159
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,318
Do you fish? I got a two-acre pond

160
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,016
that is just thick with catfish and bass...

161
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,349
I don't fish. I shoot.

162
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,195
Well, the farm's a perfect place
to do a little plinkin', so...

163
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
Well...

164
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,069
Thank you.

165
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,712
You take care, son.

166
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,949
Thank you.

167
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,472
My daughter's meeting me for lunch.
I think you two just might hit it off.

168
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,039
Nice to see you.

169
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,789
Already enhanced.

170
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,236
Was taken three years ago in Antwerp
by an undercover Interpol agent.

171
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,277
Their target's on the far right.

172
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,874
Yeah, Zalmay Atta.

173
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,635
Go on.

174
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,714
Ran the world's largest opium pipeline.

175
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,394
Ties to Karzai and Ghani, Taliban.

176
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,994
I mean, he was considered untouchable.

177
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,390
Look at the rest. Tell me what you see.

178
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,912
Yeah, I remember most of these arrests.
They were huge.

179
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,230
Focus. They're not all arrests.

180
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,759
It's the same man.

181
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,353
"Lou Carroll."

182
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,911
For what it's worth, it's an alias.

183
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,190
The Hong Kong photo
goes back about five years.

184
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,954
In that one, he's "Carl Gauss."

185
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,437
Tokyo, Tel Aviv, Naples.
There was a sighting in Tehran.

186
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,511
All describing the same man.
"An accountant."

187
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,109
"Our accountant." "The accountant."

188
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,397
The accountant, like CPA accountant?

189
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,475
Okay.

190
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,634
Say you're the head of the Sinaloa Cartel.

191
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,355
Now, the cartels count their money

192
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,670
by weighing it in 18-wheelers.

193
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,117
But one sunny Mexican day,

194
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,949
your in-house money scrubber comes to you
and says you're 30 million light.

195
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,390
Who can you trust to do
the forensic accounting,

196
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,312
track your stolen cash?

197
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,675
Deloitte and Touche? H&R Block?

198
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,631
You somehow

199
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,678
contact an individual
capable of coming in cold,

200
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,155
un-cooking years of books,

201
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,831
and getting out alive.

202
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,798
I retire in seven months.

203
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,670
Before I do, I need to know
who he is, how he does it.

204
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,400
I mean, who survives
this kind of clientele?

205
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,591
The secrets this guy has.

206
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,400
What exactly do you want me to do?

207
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,157
Report directly to me.

208
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,839
No other case work.

209
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,355
No other Treasury personnel involved.

210
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,117
At the end of the month,
one of two things will have occurred.

211
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,031
Resolution of this case,

212
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,395
or we update your photo.

213
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,790
You want it your way?
You got it!

214
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,958
Mom! Mom! Mom!

215
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,315
Mom! Why is Mom leaving? Mom!

216
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,278
Mom! Mom!

217
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,631
- I just got home.
- You're always...

218
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
Mom! Why are you leaving?

219
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,136
I'm just asking you to stay.

220
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,456
- Just, please stay.
- We had help!

221
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,520
- Stay here! Don't go anywhere!
- You threw it away!

222
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,555
No. Hey.

223
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,349
That's it.

224
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,880
Please don't leave...

225
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,736
Mom!

226
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,280
Here we go, here we go.

227
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,680
Here we go.

228
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,037
Solomon Grundy
Born on a Monday

229
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,034
Christened on Tuesday
Married on a Wednesday

230
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,350
Sick on Thursday

231
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,393
Died on a Saturday
Buried on Sunday

232
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,950
- That was the end of Solomon Grundy
- That was the end of Solomon Grundy

233
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,792
Do it again.

234
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,872
Solomon Grundy
Born on a Monday

235
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,239
Looks like somebody's seen
too many westerns.

236
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,953
Yeah, must be what...

237
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,113
A mile out?

238
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,351
Not on my best day...

239
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,753
Holy shit.

240
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,756
Okay, listen to me.

241
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,799
In-flec-tion. Right?
Listen, just listen to my tone.

242
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,793
I say, "Oh, I'm another year older,

243
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,555
"and I don't know if I'm ever gonna
get out of this fucking place."

244
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,199
And you say...

245
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,176
You're probably right, Francis.
You're extremely old.

246
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,696
- It's unlikely you'll survive to...
- No. No...

247
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,870
No. Hold on. That's not what you say.

248
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,034
Two years together
every night, you know.

249
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,277
I gave you a PhD in black money,
but you gotta learn this.

250
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,158
- This is crucial.
- You're frustrated.

251
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,600
- What am I?
- You're frustrated.

252
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,709
That's what I am.

253
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,478
I'm frustrated. Good, good. Excellent.

254
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,956
Finally. All right. Let's do another one.

255
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,757
Lights out, ladies.
Lights out.

256
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,720
Names and addresses. Go.

257
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,996
Semion Ivankov.
79 Primorsky Boulevard, Odessa.

258
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,756
The Meier brothers, Moshe and Itzhak.
221 She'arim Boulevard in Jerusalem.

259
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,673
Dominic Rabito of
960 Court Street, Brooklyn.

260
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,068
Ask for Bobby.

261
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,469
Ask for Bobby.

262
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,880
You know, I'm old.

263
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,276
I may be remembering things
a little rosier than they were.

264
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,519
I mean, you want to fill out 1040s
and itemize deductions,

265
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,760
and pull in 50 grand a year?
I mean, that's a living.

266
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,673
Because if you go down
this road, this road...

267
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,355
You can't go back, you understand?
It's dangerous. Do you understand?

268
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,589
I understand.

269
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,433
You find one person
you can trust, just one.

270
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,479
And do not make my mistake.
You keep moving your ass around.

271
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,191
They gave me a new handler today.

272
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,789
I don't like this guy. He's dull.

273
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,788
Worried.

274
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,313
Ah, fuck it.

275
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,352
Good night, son.

276
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,392
Good night, Francis.

277
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,550
What about Zurich? Saudi Arabia?

278
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,096
The Swiss are cheap.

279
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,520
Dubai is one thing, but we're
too conspicuous in the Kingdom.

280
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,715
I vote Chicago.

281
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,872
- Why?
- There's an uptick in online chatter.

282
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,189
People looking for you.

283
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,510
- What people?
- The unfriendly kind.

284
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,996
Let's try a legitimate client for once.

285
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,914
No cartels, arms brokers,
money launderers, assassins.

286
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,920
I like safe. I like you safe.

287
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,600
Everyone's hiding something.

288
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,432
At least there's honor among thieves.

289
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,751
There's honor among Illinois
electronics manufacturers.

290
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,678
They're in your current backyard.
No risk of movement. You'll meet?

291
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,709
Yeah, I'll meet.

292
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,918
One last piece of business.

293
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,229
Just the Renoir.

294
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,120
I don't have
a buyer for the Renoir.

295
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,352
The Pollock can move.
Will you ever let it go?

296
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
Hello?

297
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,354
Just the Renoir. Drop the price.

298
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,233
Heavy sigh.

299
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,270
Go to work, dreamboat.

300
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,753
Now, Mr. Wolff, I half-suspect
we're wasting your time.

301
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,433
I'm quite sure you're not.

302
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,113
And you know this how?

303
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,872
I'm on the clock.

304
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,068
Shit.

305
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,071
I hope we're not wasting ours then.

306
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,393
Look, kidding aside, I think if you
saw our books, you'd run for the hills.

307
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,274
We have an incredibly complicated
accounting system.

308
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,908
Depreciation schedules
on hundreds of different items.

309
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,957
Full-time and contract employees.

310
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,111
Department of Defense classified accounts.

311
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,429
It's a numerical shitstorm.

312
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,433
I'll need to see all those books
for the past 10 years.

313
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,239
Bank statements, complete list
of clients and vendors.

314
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,352
Hard copies printed out, my eyes only.
All the information's right here.

315
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,828
Okay, well, well, look.

316
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,833
This all came to my attention
only last week.

317
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,958
Now, a junior cost accountant
stuck her nose where it didn't belong,

318
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,151
and obviously had no idea
what she was looking at.

319
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,590
Lamar's overreacting.
There's no missing money.

320
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,115
How long have you been CFO
of this company, sir?

321
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,349
15 years.

322
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,556
I need the books for the past 15, please.

323
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,111
Well, you're awful goddamn blunt!

324
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,794
I'm Lamar Blackburn's oldest friend.

325
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,960
I've been by his side

326
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,430
since he was turning out RC robots
that RadioShack called crap.

327
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,109
I wouldn't take a dime without his say-so.

328
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,029
You're angry.

329
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,519
Oh, this is bullshit.

330
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,312
Unusual way of making contact with you,
Mr. Wolff.

331
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,951
You were recommended by Mansoor Haqqani.

332
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,509
We custom-made prosthetics
for his youngest daughter.

333
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,912
You may know that she lost both legs

334
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,634
to a car bomb
outside his investment firm in Lahore.

335
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,473
He told my brother, Lamar, that you were
nothing short of supernatural.

336
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,039
Mr. Haqqani holds advanced degrees
in mathematics from Cambridge

337
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,031
and Caltech.

338
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,990
Why does a man like that need you?

339
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,355
I don't discuss client business.

340
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,512
What do you suppose that young man
is thinking right now?

341
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,751
"Why do I still feel my arm?"

342
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,148
I don't know.

343
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,670
"How did everything go so wrong,
so fast?"

344
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,193
"It's cold. Turn up the heat."

345
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,594
Christian Wolff, I presume.

346
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
Mr. Blackburn.

347
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,188
Lamar.

348
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,789
Lamar.

349
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,269
Come with me.

350
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,115
Are you aware of Living Robotics'
three income streams?

351
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,589
Consumer electronics,
next generation prosthetics,

352
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,273
unmanned military applications.

353
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,358
Prosthetics division showed tremendous
growth over the last 10 years.

354
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,879
It seems to have matured.

355
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,669
Consumer products is your highest source
of revenue, followed closely

356
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,718
by Defense Department contracts
and prosthetics at two and three.

357
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,792
Yeah. You are well-informed.

358
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,389
I never married.

359
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,039
Never had kids.

360
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,316
This company is my child.

361
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,154
That said,
money has never been a motivation.

362
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,995
Balance sheets,
profit and loss statements...

363
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,308
My mind doesn't function
the way yours must.

364
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,033
I need you to be my eyes and ears, Chris.

365
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,954
Whatever you need to do your job,
you let me know.

366
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,832
I'll start in the morning.

367
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,191
Son of a bitch.

368
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,274
Bloody hell.

369
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,909
Excuse me...

370
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,555
Who the fuck do you think you are?

371
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,551
Do you know who the fuck I am?

372
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,713
Simon Dewey.

373
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,552
Founder, CEO, Dewey Capital.

374
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,953
American. Shocking.

375
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,034
I have kidnap insurance.
You obviously know that.

376
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,016
Sorry, but how in the world
would I know that you have...

377
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,553
You people fucking amaze me...

378
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,152
When you interrupt somebody like that,
it makes them feel

379
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,073
that you're just not interested
in what they have to say.

380
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,960
Or maybe you just think
what you have to say

381
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,071
is more important than what I have to say.

382
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,958
Is that what you think?

383
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,870
That gun makes you a big man, does it?

384
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,800
This gun? Simon, come on.

385
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,118
I'm part of a small but potent department
of a private security force.

386
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,636
We have a client, let's call it
a European manufacturing concern.

387
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,268
You're shorting their stock,
but simultaneously,

388
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,113
you're spreading false rumors
regarding the health of the company.

389
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,949
The resulting decline in the stock price,
it's made you your millions,

390
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,912
but it's been at my client's expense.

391
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,475
They have been forced
to cut hundreds of jobs, Simon.

392
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,110
These are third-generation metal workers,
people with families.

393
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,840
Pensions are being rendered worthless
because of you.

394
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,958
But you'll stop now. Correct?

395
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Which company?

396
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,469
Wrong answer, Simon.

397
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,795
Look, genius...

398
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,640
That's the same spot, Simon.

399
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,115
Why you gonna let me hit you
in the same exact spot?

400
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,395
I only meant

401
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,791
we hold short positions
on dozens of companies.

402
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,109
Shit, son.

403
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,868
I suppose

404
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,713
you're spreading false information
about more than one company.

405
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,759
If that's what you're doing, you're just
gonna have to stop shorting them all.

406
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,840
That's ridiculous.
I can't be expected to...

407
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,398
Ooh, I know.

408
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,037
All right, get your chin up, Simon.
No pouting on my watch.

409
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,153
Yeah, you're a man. You just...

410
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,753
You're a man in your own way.

411
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,640
All right.

412
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,639
I'm an avid reader of the Journal.

413
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,156
So, I expect the cooperation
to be reflected there.

414
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,148
Simon?

415
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,748
Are we good?

416
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,240
Yeah?

417
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,230
Attaboy, Simon. Proud of you.

418
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,960
Oh, hello.

419
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,436
Good morning. Oh, shit... Hi.

420
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,115
- Hi.
- Um, um...

421
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,639
I'm Dana Cummings.
You're the consultant? Mr. Wolff?

422
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,638
- Chris.
- Hi, Chris, then.

423
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,955
I'm Dana.

424
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,394
Cummings.

425
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,799
Yes. Um...

426
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,470
These are all the files you wanted.

427
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,514
I cross-referenced them
by year, and alphabetically, so...

428
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,593
It must have taken you all night.

429
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,239
It sure did.

430
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
Hmm.

431
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
Right.

432
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,509
So...

433
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,149
So...

434
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,831
What do you want, Dana Cummings?

435
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,359
Oh, Mr. Blackburn, um...

436
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,952
Sorry, he said I should...

437
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,278
I'm the person
who first noticed the missing...

438
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,432
- What I think was the missing money.
- Yes, I understand. I'll find it.

439
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,955
Yeah. I thought we could... Have lunch...

440
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,633
I brought my own lunch.

441
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,949
No...

442
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,634
I bring my own lunch, too.

443
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,950
I can answer
any questions that you have...

444
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,190
I have no questions.

445
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,432
Yeah, okay. Yeah, you wanna
make your own assessment.

446
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,794
Yes, thank you.

447
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,111
Okay. Um...

448
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,474
I'm in accounting if you need anything.

449
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,153
There's, uh,

450
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,151
some donuts there for you.

451
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,151
I don't eat donuts.

452
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Okay.

453
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,160
Mr. Secretary!

454
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,456
Yes, Helen.

455
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,879
Sir, there's been speculation

456
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,112
that your ability
to link banks in South Florida

457
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,157
to money laundering efforts of terrorists

458
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,392
are actually the result of
a whistleblower or the NSA.

459
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,560
Care to comment?

460
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,976
Let me turn this over
to the head of my task force,

461
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,639
Financial Crimes Director, Raymond King.

462
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,877
Folks, there's no great mystery here.

463
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,674
Nothing fancy. Just team effort,

464
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,879
comprised of long hours of
good old-fashioned investigative work.

465
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,520
Questions?

466
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,776
Could you answer
the whistleblower question?

467
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,080
No.

468
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,713
Hey, Sorkis, give me something.

469
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,873
I matched the face in your Antwerp photo
to surveillance video in NYPD database.

470
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,873
Wait, wait, wait. NYPD?
What did you find?

471
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,476
2006. Your guy takes out two mob enforcers

472
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,076
with a steak knife he lifted off
an Italian restaurant down the street.

473
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,760
Then he strolls into
a den of stone-cold killers

474
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,797
and goes on a seven-man killing spree,

475
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,393
using their own weapons.

476
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,798
Headshot, headshot, headshot.

477
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,069
Sorkis, stop.

478
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,549
A den of stone-cold killers?
Where is this?

479
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,553
The Ravenite. Headquarters
of the Gambino crime family.

480
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,075
He killed Anthony "Little Tony" Bazzano.

481
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,279
Forensics lists cause of death
as blunt force trauma.

482
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,233
Your boy kicked him in the head once.

483
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,231
Again. Play it again.

484
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,152
Hey, hey, hey!

485
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,630
What the fuck?

486
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,676
Wait! I gotta call it in!

487
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,351
I've also got an audio file here.

488
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,431
Inside of the Ravenite was bugged.

489
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,840
Come on.

490
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,680
Please.

491
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,319
That's Little Tony.

492
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,914
I'm fucking begging you.

493
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,634
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

494
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,136
Okay,
get me that recording ASAP.

495
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,536
I wasn't even...

496
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,640
M.B.,

497
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,111
you're an analyst for Treasury.

498
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,829
What the hell have you got yourself into?

499
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,799
What do you have to hit
to dent a steel thermos?

500
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,479
It's just old.

501
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,071
How did you, um,
get into financial consulting?

502
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,118
Department of Labor
statistics indicate

503
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,396
it's one of
the fastest-growing professions.

504
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,912
Actuarial sciences are experiencing
tremendous growth as well.

505
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,515
Okay.

506
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,759
I like the balance of it.

507
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,674
You know, I like finding things
that aren't obvious.

508
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,510
Plus, my dad was an accountant.

509
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,520
He actually...

510
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,717
You know, he had the whole shtick.
The, uh...

511
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,510
You know, the little amortization book,
and the green eyeshade,

512
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,756
and the, like,
dorky pocket protector and...

513
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,558
I have a pocket protector.

514
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,637
That's a nice one.
I mean, his was dorky, that's...

515
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,233
Yours is nice.

516
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,431
Um, but he convinced me
to go into the field.

517
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,040
Because I wanted to study art
at the Art Institute of Chicago,

518
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,751
but art doesn't pay the mortgage.

519
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,036
"Art doesn't pay the mortgage,
young lady."

520
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,394
Dad's tastes ran more to
Dogs Playing Poker.

521
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,039
I like Dogs Playing Poker.

522
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,230
Because dogs would never bet on things,

523
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,470
and so, it's incongruous.

524
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,910
I like incongruity.

525
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,755
Yeah, Dogs Playing Poker is nice.
It's just sort of a...

526
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,598
Just different.

527
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,550
So, I studied accounting
at the University of Chicago,

528
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,755
where fun goes to die.

529
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,920
Why?

530
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,908
Why what?

531
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,152
Why does fun go to die
at the University of Chicago?

532
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,831
Oh, no, it's just an expression.

533
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,789
I'm joking.

534
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,840
Right.

535
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,229
- Um, I'll leave you to it.
- Okay.

536
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,789
Let me know if you need anything
while you're here.

537
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,280
Have a nice day.

538
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,919
Yes. You, too.

539
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,960
Explain the 376,109...
6,500,000... 6, 008,000...

540
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,376
Accounts receivable,
earnings before interest...

541
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,197
Tax, depreciation,
administrative expenses...

542
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,348
100,644,000...

543
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,797
Hydraulic sync systems,
aluminum bar supplies,

544
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,791
techmod fitting, stable joints...

545
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,240
Please.

546
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,239
I'm fucking begging you.

547
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,198
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

548
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,760
I wasn't even...

549
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,279
Okay.

550
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,399
Give me something.

551
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,520
Please.

552
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,635
...fucking begging you.

553
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,109
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

554
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,176
I wasn't even...

555
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,191
Come on, come on, come on.

556
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,240
...begging you.

557
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,472
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

558
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,439
Born on a Monday

559
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,712
Christened on Tuesday
Married on Wednesday

560
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,995
Solomon Grundy

561
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,033
Born on Monday

562
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,352
Christened on Tuesday
Married on Wednesday

563
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,834
Solomon Grundy

564
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,120
Come in! Come in, come in, come in.
You have to see this. Look at this.

565
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,111
It's gonna blow you away.

566
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,511
I mean, it'll just jump right out at you.

567
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,635
There it is.

568
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,960
Uh-huh.

569
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,639
Living Robotics, 10 years ago.

570
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,096
Earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation.

571
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,918
$14,495,719.

572
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,149
Nine years ago,

573
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,359
earnings before tax and depreciation...

574
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,230
Revenues go up, profits go down.

575
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,637
Down? No large capital expenditures
dragging profits down.

576
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,109
No spike in raw materials or labor costs.

577
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,555
Year eight,
profits and revenue both go up,

578
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,199
but not in a commensurate fashion.

579
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,549
X no longer equals Y.

580
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,598
Six, five, four, three.
You're making money.

581
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,760
But there's a leak.

582
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,793
And the leak is...

583
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,191
Leak, where's the leak? Here.

584
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,880
Slewitt Manufacturing.
I've signed these checks.

585
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,393
- Who authorized it?
- Ed.

586
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,360
Mr. Chilton. They make electronic
assemblies for the consumer division.

587
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,949
No, they don't. Look at this.

588
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,712
You notice anything?

589
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,120
- Second number in each is a three.
- Yes.

590
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,191
Most people,
when generating random numbers

591
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,793
tend to rely subconsciously

592
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,216
- on certain patterns.
- Patterns, yeah.

593
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,240
Yes.

594
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,680
- I was right!
- You were right.

595
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,160
Yeah.

596
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,273
I went through these ledgers for months,
and I got through one fiscal year.

597
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,032
You went through 15 overnight?

598
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,680
That's not even the best part, look.

599
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,076
The best part is, they're routing money
to a company that doesn't exist.

600
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,232
And yet, profits go up.
And they continue going up.

601
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,594
Absolutely makes no sense.

602
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,796
- Where's the money coming from?
- Exactly!

603
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,594
Um, it's not inventory?

604
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,909
Inventory turns. No.

605
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,230
- Chargebacks to vendors?
- No. Perfectly in order.

606
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,755
- Internal offsets?
- No. That's a terrible idea.

607
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,553
Um...

608
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,233
Cummings, you're needed in

609
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,590
whatever area I'm paying you
to be needed in.

610
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,760
Sorry.

611
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,635
And?

612
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,428
$61,679,000.

613
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,639
And some change.

614
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,756
Who did it? Best guess.

615
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,512
I don't guess.

616
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,669
You'll have a report for me?

617
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,837
When I'm finished, yes.

618
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,317
- Hey, Ed.
- What the...

619
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,871
We're having lemon merengue pie.

620
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,076
Those two bottles of insulin.

621
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,353
You know, I just thought

622
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,036
that you would appreciate me
treating you like an adult, right?

623
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,912
So, here's what I got.

624
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,189
You administer your own accidental
insulin overdose, and just...

625
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,389
Die.

626
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,993
But do it with dignity.

627
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,916
Your wife, who's sleeping upstairs,
she'll be the beneficiary

628
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:28,039
of what's gotta be a very generous
insurance policy, am I right?

629
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,475
But the only way she's gonna
collect on that policy, Ed,

630
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,234
is if we have the appearance
of an accident.

631
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,194
If we lay our hands on you,
you're gonna fight, squeal.

632
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,038
She wakes up, my hands are tied.

633
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,430
One accidental death is just that,
but two, no.

634
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,591
I'll have no choice.

635
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,513
I'll have to rock and roll
a home invasion,

636
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,432
violate your wife a dozen different ways,

637
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,830
kill you both,
burn the place to the ground.

638
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,314
I'm sorry for that. Ed, Ed, Ed?

639
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,950
Hey, nobody's gonna
violate your wife, okay?

640
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,910
Aside from what that would say
about me as a human being,

641
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,556
physiologically it's a non-starter.

642
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,878
Sometimes I think I just say shit,
sample what comes out of my mouth.

643
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,834
I will, however,
park a.45 in her brainpan.

644
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,238
I honor my commitments.

645
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:22,436
It's a concept you and your sticky fingers
probably find hard to grasp.

646
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,311
Make a decision, sir.

647
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,155
Where are you going? Sir?

648
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,989
Sir?

649
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,076
Stop that. Why are you doing that?
Stop that.

650
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,073
Sir? Sir? What are you doing? Excuse me?

651
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,878
Mr. Chilton passed away.

652
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,436
I was told to clean up the room.

653
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,629
What's happening?

654
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,797
Can you give us a minute, please?

655
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,512
This is the balance of your contract.

656
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,600
- I understand you're upset...
- Yes, I'm upset.

657
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,680
I haven't finished yet.

658
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,114
Yes, you have.

659
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,478
Ed was a diabetic for 30 years.

660
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,760
You think he didn't know
how to check his blood sugar?

661
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,992
Whatever unresolved issues remain,

662
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,436
my friend was poisoned enough by them
to take his own life.

663
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,520
As far as I'm concerned,
whatever he did is forgiven.

664
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,076
Please. I need to finish, please.

665
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,515
- Sorry, I'll come back.
- No, no, come in, dear.

666
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,033
We're done.

667
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,074
You're very good, Mr. Wolff.

668
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,799
But I hope our paths never cross again.

669
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,313
I'm responsible
for the death of my best friend.

670
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,760
I'd prefer not to be reminded of it.

671
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,276
Do you think that's true?

672
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,116
That Mr. Chilton killed himself...

673
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,876
I mean, do you think we're responsible?

674
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,273
It's very hard for me to interpret
why people do what they do.

675
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,389
I'm not finished.
I'm not finished with this.

676
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,990
I mean, look... Look at this.

677
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,795
See, cost reports. This is out of order.

678
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,952
They completely rearranged this.
I don't...

679
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,516
I'm not finished. I'm not finished...

680
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,028
Bye, Chris.

681
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,798
No! Mom! Mom!

682
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,833
Mom! Mom! Mom!

683
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,551
Why is Mom leaving?

684
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,188
Mom!

685
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,680
Again.

686
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,755
Again.

687
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,149
Enough.

688
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,589
They're not done.

689
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,396
Tomorrow is another day.
They have done their best.

690
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,829
If that were true, you'd be covered
in blood and snot, not them.

691
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,313
Keep going.

692
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:15,793
Aggression, correctly channeled,
overcomes a lot of flaws.

693
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,109
Tapping into that aggression requires

694
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,872
peeling back several layers of yourself.

695
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,798
It's my job to know my sons' limitations.

696
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,834
Get up.

697
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,119
It's your job to peel.

698
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,596
Do your job. On your feet.

699
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,629
Again!

700
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,716
We could have went to his house,
shot him in his home.

701
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,552
And we'd be on a plane by now.

702
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,951
Or on a security camera,
or some nosy neighbor's iPhone.

703
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,354
Call the bookkeeper in.

704
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,496
He's just too far.
He won't hear...

705
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,635
Now.

706
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,519
Let's go. Get up. Come on.

707
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,315
Move!

708
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:31,993
Come on, come on, come on.

709
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,359
Christian!

710
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,120
Chris!

711
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,350
Again! Louder!

712
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,080
Up! Up!

713
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,278
- No, no! Please!
- What the fuck?

714
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,440
Dolores!

715
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,195
She's coming with me.

716
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,713
No, no, stop! Stop! Leave her...

717
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,514
We're all going together.
Pull that truck around back.

718
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,398
Let's go! Let's go!

719
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,240
Let's move!

720
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,955
Come on! Drive! Drive now!

721
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,800
Jesus fucking Christ!

722
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,069
God damn it!

723
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,834
Son of a bitch!

724
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,348
What the fuck?

725
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,513
When I say the name of your employer,
you say "yes."

726
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,720
Practice.

727
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,875
Yes.

728
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,880
Camorra.

729
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,560
Juárez.

730
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,194
Gambino.

731
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,274
Do you understand the rules?

732
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,835
My left pocket.

733
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,911
They paid to

734
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,834
kill you both.

735
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,149
That's all I know.

736
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,680
- Hello, dreamboat.
- Dana's in danger.

737
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,400
Kill Christian Wolff,
transfer all domestic accounts overseas.

738
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,591
- Current vehicle?
- F-150.

739
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,470
- Virus to triple Z?
- Wipe everything.

740
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,598
Done. In the DOT database now.

741
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,677
Reassigning the license and VIN.

742
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,354
I have George Boole
or Charles Babbage in the queue.

743
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,272
Boole. Obviously.

744
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,032
Silly of me. What else?

745
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,313
She is not your problem.

746
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,914
Straight to the trailer,
hook it up, and disappear.

747
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,348
There's no time.

748
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,839
Only the trailer.

749
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,554
Address and phone number. Get it.

750
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,114
She's not answering.

751
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,080
Could have used the small box.

752
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,038
Well, she looked bigger in the photo.

753
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,040
God!

754
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,152
God damn!

755
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,520
Bitch!

756
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,400
Fuck.

757
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,108
We should go.

758
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,838
Since when are accountants
difficult to ventilate?

759
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,673
Dead?

760
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:49,832
Christ! What'd he do, hit him
over the head with an adding machine?

761
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,348
Oh, God.

762
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,798
All right, just put me in touch
with the client.

763
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,189
I'll handle this accountant myself.

764
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,959
Running isn't an option for me.
I can't just walk out on my life!

765
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:13,351
We have to go to the police.
That's what normal, taxpaying people do!

766
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:17,513
Police can't protect you from someone
who can afford to return $61 million.

767
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,496
Return?
What are you talking about, "return"?

768
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,272
The money was being put back.

769
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,589
Stay here.

770
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,320
What are you doing in here?

771
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,549
- Who are you?
- You can't...

772
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,835
You should not be here.

773
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,911
Sit down. Sit right there.

774
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,193
What is this place?

775
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,869
PanAmerica, Airstream.

776
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,794
34 feet 7 inches long,

777
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,191
8 feet 5 inches wide.

778
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,792
Dimensions which are perfectly adequate
for one person.

779
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,393
Preferable, even.

780
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,919
This is where you live?

781
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,913
No, I don't live here.
This is a storage unit.

782
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,080
That would be weird.

783
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,639
That's what would be weird?

784
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,189
I'd like to spend more time here.

785
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,119
However, I'm afraid some of my clients
might follow me.

786
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,395
Why would your clients follow you?
You're an accountant!

787
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:10,153
How do you know what to do here?
Why are you prepared for this?

788
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,799
Plus, this is on wheels,

789
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,190
which means I can hook it up
and be gone in 12 minutes.

790
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,360
Usually.

791
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,558
Sarcasm? Is that sarcasm?

792
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,393
No, that's not sarcasm.
I don't use sarcasm. It's irritation.

793
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:24,136
Everything in the world that is
important to me is in this trailer.

794
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,680
And right now, changing my routine
for you is jeopardizing that.

795
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,670
Tell me that's not an original Pollock.

796
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:39,909
We should go.

797
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,275
Now.

798
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,112
- Medina.
- Miss Medina?

799
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,033
This is Gordon Amundson
with the FBI Language Services.

800
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,997
Uh, yeah. Any luck?

801
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,276
It's an unusual audio file.

802
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:12,035
Solomon Grundy is a nursery rhyme
circa mid-1800s.

803
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,555
Your voice has four of
the six intonation patterns

804
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,551
we use to define American English.

805
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,995
That's difficult to confirm with a rhyme.

806
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,871
Out of curiosity,
was your subject a trauma victim?

807
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,957
Um, why do you ask that?

808
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,475
Well, you indicated on your submission

809
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:30,359
that this event occurred
in a high-stress environment?

810
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,397
Yeah. Exceptionally.

811
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,959
That's interesting.

812
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,630
The verse was repeated
a total of four and a half times

813
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:44,035
with zero variation in pitch, span, tempo,
volume, or articulatory precision.

814
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,918
So, what does that mean, exactly?

815
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,548
Well, we often see
this type of repetitive chanting

816
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,910
in children
who have been exposed to trauma

817
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,991
or persons with
neurodevelopmental disorders.

818
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,351
Neurodevelopmental disorders?

819
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,755
Fragile-X syndrome, autism.

820
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,839
Okay, so...

821
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,752
Let's say I was looking at mugshots.

822
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,435
How would that present itself?
What exactly would I be looking for?

823
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:10,196
Fragile-X: Elongated face,
protruding ears, poor muscle tone.

824
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,399
Autism's nearly impossible
to identify visually.

825
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,118
The traits are behavioral:

826
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,078
difficulty with
social interaction, communication,

827
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,077
lack of eye contact.

828
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,114
Lack of eye contact.

829
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,113
Okay.

830
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,280
Good luck to you.

831
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,440
Thanks.

832
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,998
None of this makes sense.

833
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,311
Why go through the trouble of skimming
the money if you're gonna put it back?

834
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,760
Over the last two years,

835
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,913
the number of invoices submitted
by Slewitt Manufacturing declined.

836
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,639
Scared of getting caught?

837
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:33,635
Price hikes?

838
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,950
Prices of consumer electronics
go down, not up.

839
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,310
Right, down, yeah.

840
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,474
I can't afford this.

841
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,278
I know. My treat.

842
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,953
In the US, 104 men,

843
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:53,352
last name any standard derivation
of your mathematician, Carl Gauss,

844
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:58,958
reported over $500,000
in any of the last seven years.

845
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,792
Okay. Go a million plus.

846
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,514
Seventeen.

847
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:07,195
Of the 17,
how many between the ages of 25 and 45?

848
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,029
Four.

849
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,515
Of those four,

850
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:14,468
only one has an income stream
that's cash-heavy or easily laundered.

851
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:15,789
And he

852
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,878
died three years ago.

853
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:26,800
What's this?

854
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,468
It's names of
the 100 most famous mathematicians.

855
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,800
Look, we know what we're doing now.

856
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:36,230
So, just enter the names,
narrow down the search right off the bat.

857
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,833
Male, Caucasian,

858
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,594
25 to 45, earning a million plus.

859
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,877
No investment income.
He'll concentrate on cash.

860
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,354
What's in it for me?

861
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,876
Look, if you help me find him,

862
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:52,080
I'll see what I can do
about getting you outta here.

863
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,428
Please.

864
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,517
Single earner or filing jointly?

865
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,757
Hey, those paintings in your trailer...

866
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,270
- They're real, right?
- Yes.

867
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,876
You didn't buy them at auction, did you?

868
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,758
They're a form of payment.

869
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,789
Right.

870
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,109
Hey.

871
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,959
Thank you.

872
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,594
At my apartment.

873
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:39,760
Oh.

874
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,869
Yeah.

875
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,432
Can we sit down for a second?

876
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,275
Yeah. Okay.

877
01:07:58,640 --> 01:07:59,640
Just...

878
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,275
Sit.

879
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:21,675
How do you, um,

880
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,956
know how to...

881
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,954
My father was an officer in the Army.
Psychological Operations.

882
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,195
He was concerned that I might be
taken advantage of somehow,

883
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:39,797
so he arranged for me to train
with a number of specialists

884
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,313
throughout my childhood.

885
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:44,393
We lived in 34 homes in 17 years.

886
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,277
- You moved 34 times?
- Mmm-hmm.

887
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,552
God. That's extraordinary.

888
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,550
No, I'm sure
it must've been difficult, but...

889
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,913
I haven't been anywhere.

890
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:03,031
Well, Cancun. Not my proudest moment.

891
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:04,880
Um...

892
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,073
I just mean...

893
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,868
Your life is unique.

894
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:17,073
It's not unique. I have
a high-functioning form of autism,

895
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,000
which means I have
an extremely narrow focus

896
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:23,078
and a hard time abandoning tasks
once I've taken them up.

897
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:27,392
I have difficulty socializing
with other people, even though

898
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:30,159
I want to.

899
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:41,071
When I was a senior in high school,
I wanted this special dress for prom.

900
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,952
I told myself that spending $100

901
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,896
on a trashy dress
that I was gonna wear one time

902
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,136
to an event that I thought was
silly in the first place, was...

903
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,355
- Wasteful.
- Yes.

904
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,997
But Vera Wang
made this black, strapless classic.

905
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,936
It was more expensive, but you could
wear it to all kinds of future events.

906
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,632
- It was an investment.
- Yes.

907
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:00,717
Where were you when I was in high school?

908
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,115
Oh, North Carolina, Israel.

909
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,109
Right. Um...

910
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:09,196
The problem was
they wanted $1700 for this dress,

911
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,520
and I didn't have that, so...

912
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,153
- You asked your parents?
- No.

913
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,028
Hang on.

914
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,479
Blackjack. I'd never played a hand,

915
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,296
but I went to the library, and I
checked out all these books on strategy.

916
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,840
And I turned the Naperville North
math club into a little Vegas.

917
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,951
- What's a math club?
- Math club?

918
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,838
You compete against other schools.

919
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,991
Theory and speed math.

920
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:36,271
Like, what's 298,567 times 92?

921
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:41,630
27,468, 164.

922
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,154
Right. Um...

923
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,560
Blackjack.

924
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:53,551
I could tell you
when to hit, stand, split, re-split.

925
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:56,837
I moved on to card counting,
shuffle tracking, hole carding.

926
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,709
And I took everything I had,
which was $183,

927
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,678
and I drove down to Harrah's in Joliet.

928
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,400
Why was this dress so important to you?

929
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,192
It wasn't about the dress.

930
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:13,791
I just wanted to walk into the gym
and have everybody say "Wow!"

931
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:19,030
I was trying to belong.

932
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,311
I was trying to connect.

933
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:27,240
I think no matter how different we are,
we're all trying to do the same thing.

934
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:36,030
But I lost all but $20
in the first 10 minutes.

935
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,714
I fed that into a nickel slot
on the way out,

936
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,871
- and I won two grand.
- Hmm.

937
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,395
I used the extra cash to pay for a limo.

938
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,829
Only wore the dress the one time.

939
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,230
Chris, why are we here?

940
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:05,240
Um...

941
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,189
I thought this hotel
had good water pressure.

942
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,752
The Holiday Inn Express in Aurora
has good water pressure.

943
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:15,593
Yes, but these towels are very fancy,

944
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,633
and cheaper hotels have scratchy towels.

945
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,479
And

946
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,079
I wanted you to like it.

947
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,756
Crazy Eddie and the Panama Pump.

948
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:48,473
Crazy Eddie Antar and the Panama Pump.
Have you ever heard of...

949
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,949
- What?
- Crazy Eddie Antar.

950
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:55,159
He owned a string of electronic stores
in New York City in the '80s.

951
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,830
Crazy Eddie Antar, he started stealing
almost as soon as he opened business.

952
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,115
Okay, I'm not following.

953
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:01,952
He deposited money in Tel Aviv,

954
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:05,078
and then he cycled it through Panama
and put it back into his stores.

955
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,760
Okay, why take it out and put it back?

956
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,957
Well, initially he was just stealing
in garden-variety tax evasion,

957
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,315
but then he came up with a better idea.

958
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,391
You see, by taking his own money,

959
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,949
stealing it, and putting it back
on his books...

960
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,593
He was raining cash.

961
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:20,671
He took the company public at $8 a share.

962
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:23,513
A year later, it was trading at $75.

963
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:28,516
- Rita's taking Living Robotics public.
- Yes.

964
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,440
But why would she hire you
in the first place

965
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,630
if she thought you would figure it out?

966
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,194
I don't know.

967
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,193
I'll have to ask her.

968
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,151
Whatever Rita's involvement,
it's not your concern.

969
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,356
You disappear, I make a call.

970
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,397
Please. I worry about you.

971
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,994
If I don't do something, Dana will die.

972
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,515
Risking your life for a girl
you've known a week.

973
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,680
Why?

974
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,553
Heavy sigh.

975
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,199
What's the plan?

976
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,476
Find the person who wants to kill her.

977
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:04,835
And?

978
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,793
Shoot them in the head.

979
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,274
Last one.

980
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:26,115
Wolff, two "F" s, Christian.

981
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,836
Two hundred and forty five men.

982
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,670
Four with incomes over a million.

983
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,554
All over the age of 60. Sorry.

984
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,837
Right.
Your guy's an accountant.

985
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:46,191
Two Christian Wolffs own CPA firms.

986
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:49,193
The first Christian Wolff owns...

987
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:55,150
Wolff Accounting. 121 South Street,
Scottsdale, Arizona.

988
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,199
Income of 435 grand. It's a good year.

989
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:03,032
So good, we audited him two years ago.

990
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,349
He's clean.

991
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,476
The other Christian Wolff...

992
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:11,598
Nope. Only 75 grand.

993
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,194
ZZZ Accounting.

994
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:20,555
Wabash Way, Plainfield, Illinois.

995
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:21,869
ZZZ.

996
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:25,555
I mean, it's not exactly
a smart Yellow Pages move.

997
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,273
Wait a second.

998
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:37,557
Who filed the returns for
Kim's Nails, Wabash Way, Plainfield?

999
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,233
ZZZ Accounting.
Could just be the neighborly...

1000
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,756
Great Mandarin, Wabash.

1001
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:49,909
ZZZ Accounting.

1002
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,433
Paul's Laundromat.

1003
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,798
ZZZ Accounting.

1004
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,555
Tell me they're all
registered as partnerships.

1005
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:03,875
Every one.

1006
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,913
Managing partner...

1007
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,229
Christian Wolff.

1008
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:18,557
- Christian Wolff.
- Come in.

1009
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:23,271
Christian Wolff, last year, ran $75,543
through his accounting firm.

1010
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,600
Whoa. Who is Christian Wolff?

1011
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,153
The accountant.

1012
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,870
- 75 grand? That's chump change.
- Agreed.

1013
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:36,717
But he ran another $287765
through Kim's Nails,

1014
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:41,510
$445,112 through Great Mandarin Chinese,
and you'll love this,

1015
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:45,992
$505,909 through Paul's Laundromat.

1016
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,639
Paul's Laundromat?
Are you fucking kidding me?

1017
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:50,835
He's playing with us.

1018
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:53,560
He can't clean that kind of money
through an accounting firm.

1019
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:55,193
The paper trail's too heavy.

1020
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,136
So, he's laundering it
through cash businesses.

1021
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:59,720
All of those are in the same strip mall
south of Chicago.

1022
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,160
ZZZ?

1023
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:04,471
I mean, he doesn't care about the traffic.
It's a front. All of it.

1024
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,155
Christian Wolff, Carl Gauss,
Lou "Lewis" Carroll.

1025
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,471
He's using the names
of famous mathematicians as a cover.

1026
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:18,029
Charitable contributions here
to Harbor Neuroscience.

1027
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,316
Last year alone,
that's gotta come to close to...

1028
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:21,919
$1,000,100.

1029
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,833
That one's not a cover.
That's the real deal. I checked.

1030
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,600
So, you're telling me
this guy risks his life

1031
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,548
doing forensic accounting for some
of the scariest people on the planet,

1032
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:34,240
collects his fee, goes through
all the trouble of laundering it,

1033
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,117
and then gives almost all of it away?

1034
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,678
Well, what if
he's taking other means of payment?

1035
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,712
Yeah, possible. Yeah.

1036
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,039
I caught him, Ray.

1037
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,028
Maybe.

1038
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:52,196
Pack a bag. We're going to Chicago.

1039
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,320
90% probability they're all right-handed.

1040
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,270
Up to me, I'd snap four right wrists.

1041
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,115
But maybe you enjoy waiting
on a schoolyard sucker punch.

1042
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:22,556
Life is a series of choices,
none of which are new.

1043
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:28,359
The oldest is choosing to be a victim.

1044
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,192
Or choosing not to.

1045
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,790
Second oldest: loyalty.

1046
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,631
Family first, good times or bad.

1047
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,831
Bonjour, fellas.

1048
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:51,197
They're only glasses.

1049
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:57,996
You think if you don't fight back,
then maybe they'll like you.

1050
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,759
Stop picking on you, calling you "freak."

1051
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,078
Well, here's what it is.

1052
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:07,232
They don't like you,
they don't dislike you.

1053
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,433
They're afraid of you.

1054
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,353
You're different.

1055
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,999
Sooner or later,
"different" scares people.

1056
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:23,035
Victim or not? Make a decision.

1057
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,395
Go.

1058
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,758
You're different.

1059
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,833
Sooner or later,
"different" scares people.

1060
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,513
In here.

1061
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,751
.357 Colt Python.

1062
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:44,158
Serial number's gone.

1063
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,869
Hydra-Shoks.

1064
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,917
Wireless security cam.

1065
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,229
Infrared, weatherproof.

1066
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,278
He's got a network of 'em.

1067
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,590
Whole backyard's got eyes.

1068
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:16,948
This is our guy.

1069
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:20,317
So, why does a guy who's
up to his elbows in cash live here?

1070
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:24,877
Given his clientele, he figures
blending in will extend his shelf life.

1071
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,157
It's the smart move.

1072
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:30,676
Well, maybe not smart enough.

1073
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:34,074
High-tech security cameras back here,

1074
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,551
anybody could roll up in the front.

1075
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,877
How does he cover this?

1076
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:46,235
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

1077
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:55,598
Don't see that every day.

1078
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:00,473
Boys, let's have a situation report.

1079
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:02,549
We good, Ike?

1080
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,279
All clear.

1081
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:05,555
Rock and roll.

1082
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,797
And how about you, sport?

1083
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,593
It's Bobby.

1084
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,079
I got nothing.

1085
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,913
Okay, yeah, I'm getting a feed
on the camera now.

1086
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,479
Move it to the left side.

1087
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,440
Is all this really necessary?

1088
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,513
You should be watching his home.

1089
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:26,795
Yeah? What you think?

1090
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:28,912
That's your idea on the subject?

1091
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,759
Love it when people tell me
how to do my job.

1092
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,751
I believe I recommended
you leave the country.

1093
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,593
- You declined.
- He's an accountant!

1094
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:40,675
I could see it in his eyes.
The freak wasn't gonna let it go.

1095
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:45,794
My best to Michelle.

1096
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,154
I will.

1097
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:06,633
I was old 10 years ago.

1098
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,791
So, what's your story, Medina?

1099
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:14,479
You know my story.

1100
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:16,995
I know what the courts said.

1101
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:23,508
Stuffed a handful of cocaine
up a drug dealer's nose,

1102
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:26,148
pistol-whipped him
into the trunk of his car.

1103
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:30,711
I was 17. It was August.

1104
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:34,915
He cooked for three days, but lived.

1105
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:36,519
Do you regret it?

1106
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:39,148
The coke was half borax.

1107
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:42,035
Same shit he kept selling my sister.

1108
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,992
She's a dental hygienist in Annapolis now.

1109
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,196
Married, three kids.

1110
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,433
No, I don't regret it.

1111
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:56,358
That's rough.

1112
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,556
All due respect, Director King,

1113
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:02,188
what the fuck do you know about "rough"?

1114
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,916
Wait! I gotta call it in!

1115
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:10,080
Move it!

1116
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,878
You tell me, Medina.

1117
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:20,278
Men kill each other
for any number of reasons.

1118
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,600
Bobby, you hear me?

1119
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:24,393
Money, power...

1120
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:25,795
Fear.

1121
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,360
Right there, motherfucker!

1122
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,837
Nine men would die
that day at the Ravenite,

1123
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,188
but for none of those reasons.

1124
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:42,910
No, they'd taken something
from the man who was killing them.

1125
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:47,074
Something that couldn't
be made whole again.

1126
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:50,910
Something very important to him.

1127
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,795
And he was there for his pound of flesh.

1128
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,473
Please.

1129
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:58,079
Just fucking stop, man!

1130
01:28:58,240 --> 01:28:59,878
Just put the gun down!

1131
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:03,152
Little Tony Bazzano.

1132
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,670
I'd been wedged in a van for six months

1133
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,798
listening to that arrogant little prick
belch, fart, and brag.

1134
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,349
Please.

1135
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:12,953
I'm fucking begging you.

1136
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:15,913
I didn't recognize his voice
with all the fear in it.

1137
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:18,918
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

1138
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:20,269
I wasn't even...

1139
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,952
Our man had come for revenge.

1140
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,799
And he got it.

1141
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,159
Nine dead.

1142
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,473
And I was 10.

1143
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,075
Your name?

1144
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:43,874
Ray.

1145
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:46,712
Raymond King.

1146
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:49,110
Who employs you, Raymond King?

1147
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,638
I'm a Treasury agent.

1148
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:55,998
Are you a good one?

1149
01:29:58,480 --> 01:29:59,595
No.

1150
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,318
No, not particularly.

1151
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:04,708
Is that it?

1152
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:08,832
Kids, I got... I'm a dad.

1153
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,513
I got two kids.

1154
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:13,354
Grown?

1155
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:16,989
Yeah.

1156
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:20,592
Yes, yes, they're all...
They're all grown up.

1157
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,914
Were you a good dad, Raymond King?

1158
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:31,154
Yeah. I've been a good dad.

1159
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:37,835
I'm a lousy agent,
and I've been a weak man,

1160
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,516
but that I didn't screw up.

1161
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:44,672
That I got right.

1162
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:00,079
Imagine you're a Treasury agent

1163
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:04,438
approaching the twilight
of a spectacularly dismal career.

1164
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:10,596
And then one day, that break
you should have been looking for.

1165
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:13,877
Francis Silverberg, a black money legend.

1166
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:17,555
Cleaned cash from Monte Carlo
to Havana to Vegas.

1167
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:22,793
He cooked the books for the Gambino family
for 40-plus years.

1168
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:25,394
Until one day, the boss, Big Tony Bazzano,

1169
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:29,075
thought maybe the old man's age
made him vulnerable to prosecution.

1170
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:32,277
Ordered his son, Little Tony,
to kill Francis.

1171
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,274
Kid fucked it up.

1172
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:38,672
Francis ran, became a federal informant
in return for protective custody.

1173
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:41,948
Could have turned my career around

1174
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,758
if only I'd listened.

1175
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:46,908
I didn't.

1176
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:51,155
He was processed out,
and he lost the only protection he had.

1177
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,816
Stand clear of the gate.

1178
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:57,755
The protection that he was promised
when he testified against Big Tony.

1179
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,633
And this time, Little Tony got it right.

1180
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:06,596
He had Francis in a couple hours.

1181
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:11,999
Down in a filthy basement in the Bronx,
nailed to a chair,

1182
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:15,437
tortured to death.

1183
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:23,116
So, I volunteered for a joint task force.

1184
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:26,552
Sat outside the Ravenite
in a surveillance van for months

1185
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:29,837
hoping to get a shred of evidence
to use against Francis' killers.

1186
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:34,640
Wait! Wait!

1187
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,115
I gotta call it in!

1188
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:38,955
Move it!

1189
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,628
I went in there
hoping I could ease my guilt.

1190
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,632
And I met our accountant.

1191
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:50,039
Why he let me live, I didn't know.

1192
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:53,278
But he changed my life.

1193
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,676
Gave my notice at the Department.

1194
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:02,320
I started looking forward
to the day again.

1195
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:05,199
You know, feeling the sun on my face.

1196
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,319
Quit drinking.

1197
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:09,677
Was on my way out the door...

1198
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:12,833
And then, the phone rang.

1199
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:14,520
Ray King.

1200
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:16,159
I'll never forget that voice.

1201
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:18,555
Do you like puzzles, Raymond King?

1202
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:23,195
She tells me she works for the accountant.

1203
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:27,436
And that a shipping container
packed with Chinese nationals

1204
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,273
is passing through the Port of New York.

1205
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:32,433
Few months later,

1206
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:36,752
one ton of uncut Juárez cartel product
is entering Miami.

1207
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,519
All those cases you put together...

1208
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,359
Smoke and mirrors.

1209
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:49,713
So, who is he?

1210
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:52,240
This accountant.

1211
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:56,109
Prisoner 831.
Fort Leavenworth, maximum security.

1212
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:57,548
Military prison?

1213
01:33:58,560 --> 01:33:59,879
So, he was in the Army?

1214
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:04,472
Army lent him to us to track
al-Qaeda money launderers.

1215
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:09,235
He was transferred from Leavenworth
to our detention center in D. C.

1216
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,711
Did the work of five men.

1217
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:16,111
Data mining, cluster analysis.

1218
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:19,278
He roomed with Francis.

1219
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:22,439
They kept to themselves, played chess,

1220
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:26,070
ate together, sat in the TV room together.

1221
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:28,953
They were inseparable.

1222
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:32,278
And then one day, a guard told Wolff

1223
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:35,796
why Francis hadn't called or written
since he got out.

1224
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:40,234
That his burnt body had been found
in a Staten Island landfill.

1225
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:45,396
Wolff snapped, went after the guard.

1226
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:48,752
He fractured the man's skull
with a thermos.

1227
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,511
Escaped from a third-floor window.

1228
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,273
Took the thermos.

1229
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:58,196
That's all you got? I mean, Leavenworth,
he'll have military records...

1230
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:00,032
Records are all heavily redacted.

1231
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,952
Well, then arrest records, something?

1232
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:06,479
Spring of 2003, at a funeral home
in Kankakee, Illinois.

1233
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:12,192
Our boy sends six locals to the hospital
with a variety of injuries.

1234
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:15,313
No one knew Wolff.

1235
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,278
The older man who came with him
was identified as a colonel, US Army.

1236
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,799
A funeral home.

1237
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:25,799
Whose wake?

1238
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:28,190
One customer that day.

1239
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:33,516
Mrs. Lauren Alton.

1240
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:39,793
Mrs. Alton taught first grade
for 13 years in Kankakee.

1241
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:43,476
Survived by a husband
and two boys, ages 12 and 10.

1242
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,031
By all accounts,
an ordinary life, well lived.

1243
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:50,319
But cut short.

1244
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:52,674
It'll be all right.

1245
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:56,400
Excuse me, sir, this is

1246
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:57,669
family only.

1247
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:01,833
Sir, I'm going to ask you
to step outside.

1248
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:06,752
And then a fight breaks out.
A brawl, really.

1249
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:10,071
Over what,
the authorities never pinned down.

1250
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:11,349
Get your hands...

1251
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:17,199
Deputies respond.

1252
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:22,756
A Barney Fife-type squares off
with our boy, gets rattled, pulls his gun.

1253
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,875
The colonel just stepped in front of 831.

1254
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,393
Army collects both men.

1255
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:34,198
Police report names Wolff
as "Soldier One."

1256
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:37,598
And widower
identified the colonel by name.

1257
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:40,350
His late wife's former husband.

1258
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,791
I checked. It's an alias.

1259
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,909
No more real than "Christian Wolff."

1260
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:52,279
She was the dead colonel's ex-wife.

1261
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,394
And you think Wolff is what to him?

1262
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:07,311
Were you a good dad, Ray King?

1263
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:19,753
I've given up trying to figure out
when I'll get a call.

1264
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:22,753
The "why" though, that I've got.

1265
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:25,950
Someone breaks his moral code.

1266
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:39,116
Why are you telling me this?

1267
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:41,351
I'm retiring in a few months.

1268
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:44,832
When she calls,

1269
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:49,148
somebody needs to be there to answer.

1270
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:05,109
No.

1271
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:10,192
He's a criminal, Ray.

1272
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:11,469
Yeah.

1273
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:14,791
He aids and abets drug cartels,
money launderers.

1274
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,870
He's a fucking killer.

1275
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,394
Believe me,
I wrestled with the same decision.

1276
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,993
But when I got that first call,

1277
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,631
I realized something.

1278
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:37,518
I'd spent my whole life only recognizing
my lucky breaks after they were gone.

1279
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:46,233
The Brit, who is she?

1280
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:01,269
Hello?

1281
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:02,839
Miss Medina.

1282
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:06,993
Tell Eliot Ness to get his feet
off the furniture.

1283
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:09,037
He's not in a barn.

1284
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,194
Living Robotics.

1285
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:14,433
Write it down.

1286
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:21,308
North of six feet, short hair,
athletic build, yes?

1287
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:23,440
- Correct.
- But when you say short hair,

1288
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:25,856
you mean short hair like my hair,
or you mean short hair like...

1289
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:27,029
What's the difference?

1290
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:28,872
I was told you could fix this, so fix it!

1291
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,360
But you did speak to the man, am I right?
You spoke to him?

1292
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:32,589
What did he sound like?

1293
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:36,036
I didn't make small talk.
What's it matter what he sounded...

1294
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:39,871
That's Ike, right? That's the north side?

1295
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,551
Yo, Bobby, was that you?

1296
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:45,560
Bob.

1297
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,628
Bobby.

1298
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:54,389
Ike, are you there?

1299
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,149
Ike?

1300
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:01,228
Guys, stop fucking around.
Someone answer me. Ike?

1301
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:03,072
Pull was to the left.

1302
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:06,755
You might consider using a round
with a superior ballistic coefficient.

1303
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,432
Give me the layout of the home.

1304
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,831
Points of entry, corridors, rooms, cover.

1305
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Go.

1306
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,239
Fuck.

1307
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:22,800
- Sit down.
- What's this...

1308
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,711
Shut up. Sit down in the chair.

1309
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:56,635
You ever see a match-grade round traveling
3,000 feet per second go through a window?

1310
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:00,069
Nobody does.

1311
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,389
Get down, now!

1312
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:40,671
Four men, front entrance.

1313
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:43,118
Go right at him. Go now.

1314
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:49,720
You...

1315
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:51,789
I got the cameras.

1316
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,592
Go join your friends.

1317
01:41:58,520 --> 01:41:59,520
Up.

1318
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:03,480
Clear.

1319
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:17,760
Smoke.

1320
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:43,953
Go, go!

1321
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:46,195
Go, go!

1322
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:03,752
Attack front entry!

1323
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:05,399
Man down!

1324
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:09,000
Guys, talk to me.

1325
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,351
You got eyes on who it is?

1326
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:18,600
Someone talk to me.
Let me know what the sitrep is.

1327
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,028
Are they dead?

1328
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:47,315
Give me a situation report.
How many down?

1329
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:49,719
Are they dead? Answer me!

1330
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:54,914
Okay, he's on the roof.
Start forming up. Let's move.

1331
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:56,758
Check skylights, check windows.

1332
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:58,000
That motherfucker comes in,

1333
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:00,628
I wanna hear gunshots
and I wanna hear "target eliminated."

1334
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:13,520
That's enough. He's in the goddamn house.

1335
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:15,435
Get out there and end this!

1336
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:18,400
Brax, give me a situation report.
Have you got eyes on anything?

1337
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:29,032
What's happening?

1338
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,119
Say something!

1339
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:50,997
Solomon Grundy
Born on a Monday

1340
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:55,268
Christened on Tuesday
Married on Wednesday

1341
01:46:56,160 --> 01:47:00,312
Sick on Thursday
Worse on Friday

1342
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:05,393
Died on Saturday
Buried on Sunday

1343
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:10,479
"And that was the end of Solomon Grundy"

1344
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:15,752
What is this?

1345
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:38,200
Hey! Hey!

1346
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:39,429
Stand down!

1347
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:40,675
Fuck off!

1348
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:23,078
Hello, Braxton.

1349
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:25,069
No, no.

1350
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:29,035
Don't...

1351
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:31,439
Don't do that...

1352
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,376
Been looking for you for 10 years,

1353
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:38,616
and you're gonna come at me
like we just saw each other yesterday?

1354
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:40,278
That's what you're gonna do?

1355
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:41,669
What did I...

1356
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:44,118
What'd I think?

1357
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:47,750
What'd I think? That you were gonna be
happy to see me, I guess.

1358
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:50,959
I am happy.

1359
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:58,032
I need to finish.

1360
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:01,269
You should go.

1361
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:02,873
I should go?

1362
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:05,434
Okay...

1363
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:07,918
Okay, I'll just go.

1364
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:11,075
But first, I'm gonna ask you a question.

1365
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:12,639
You're gonna give me an answer.

1366
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:15,760
Why would you and Pop go to that funeral?

1367
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:17,440
She left us. Do you not remember that?

1368
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:19,158
Do you not remember that?

1369
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:29,436
It's your fault that Pop's dead!
You hear me?

1370
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:30,600
It's your fault!

1371
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:32,557
- I'm sorry, Braxton.
- Sorry?

1372
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:34,631
Sorry doesn't cut it, you weird fuck!

1373
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:59,953
You don't give a shit about me?
You don't give a shit about me?

1374
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:08,633
How about now?

1375
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:10,915
How about now?

1376
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:19,117
Are you gonna fight?

1377
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:22,509
Fight!

1378
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:16,598
I'm sorry, Braxton.

1379
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:22,430
If you had to see her,

1380
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:26,999
if that was something that you had to do,

1381
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:29,273
you call me.

1382
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,878
I'm your brother.
I've always had your back.

1383
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:36,235
You don't call him, you call me.

1384
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:44,791
Did you even wonder where I was?

1385
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:46,598
I knew where you were.

1386
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:49,716
I just wanted you to be safe.

1387
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:51,518
Some of my clients

1388
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:53,639
are quite dangerous.

1389
01:51:56,080 --> 01:52:00,039
I'm, kind of, considered
fairly dangerous myself.

1390
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:03,712
Well, you've made improvements.

1391
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:13,913
Shit, man.

1392
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:16,798
You and me here...

1393
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:19,119
What are the odds?

1394
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:20,474
Statistically speaking...

1395
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:22,631
Christ, man! It's rhetorical.

1396
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:24,637
I mean, really?

1397
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:27,199
I was just saying.

1398
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:33,436
Not happy.

1399
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:37,276
Do you consider
what you do important, Mr. Wolff?

1400
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:39,749
To someone other than yourself, I mean?

1401
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:42,230
What I do is.

1402
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:46,839
Living Robotics' public offering
would've been worth billions.

1403
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,958
Money to be used
for neuroprosthetics, nanotechnology.

1404
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:51,155
You...

1405
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:55,475
Why in God's name did I ever hire you?

1406
01:52:55,640 --> 01:52:57,471
To leak-proof your books.

1407
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:01,833
Dana found a mistake, and you wanted
to be sure it was safe to go public.

1408
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:04,112
And now you want to kill her.

1409
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:05,429
I'm fond of Dana.

1410
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:08,520
But I restore lives, not Dana! Me!

1411
01:53:08,680 --> 01:53:12,719
Men, women, children,
I give them hope. Make them whole.

1412
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:14,438
Do you even know what that's like?

1413
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:15,868
Yes, I do.

1414
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:31,509
Sorry.

1415
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:36,879
I missed you.

1416
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:45,792
"Missed you, too, Braxton.

1417
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,231
"Missed you, too, because I love you.

1418
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:53,072
"You're my brother."

1419
01:53:55,680 --> 01:53:56,908
Maybe...

1420
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:59,272
Do you want to...

1421
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:02,231
Maybe I could see you in a week?

1422
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:04,595
You name the place. I'll be there.

1423
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:20,352
How will I find you?

1424
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:22,953
You won't.

1425
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:25,192
I'll find you.

1426
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:32,320
There.

1427
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:35,438
How do you respond to rumors

1428
01:54:35,680 --> 01:54:38,956
that some of the victims have wounds
consistent with anti-aircraft rounds?

1429
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:40,951
I'd say the Chicago Police Department

1430
01:54:41,120 --> 01:54:44,112
has ample experience
solving all manner of homicides.

1431
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:47,635
Tom.

1432
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:49,796
Sir, how are the conspiracy
and fraud charges

1433
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:52,679
related to the deaths of Lamar Blackburn
and his sister, Rita?

1434
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:54,990
This is a very fluid situation

1435
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:59,115
with a lot of surprising revelations
over the last 48 hours.

1436
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:02,915
Let me introduce you to the person
leading the investigation...

1437
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:05,155
Agent Medina.

1438
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:16,675
Um...

1439
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:18,188
Good afternoon.

1440
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:24,917
As much as I'd like
to take credit for this,

1441
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:27,752
I can't.

1442
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:37,714
Because this was a team effort

1443
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:42,558
comprised of long hours
of good old-fashioned investigative work.

1444
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:43,720
Questions?

1445
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:53,552
He was just like our other two.
He was a happy baby.

1446
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:56,548
Now he rarely speaks.

1447
01:55:57,200 --> 01:55:59,634
It's like our child is missing.
He's not there.

1448
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:02,189
He's lost, and he needs our help.

1449
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:04,873
We thought...

1450
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:07,879
We thought...

1451
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:10,713
We hoped that he would catch back up.

1452
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:12,868
But he didn't.

1453
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:15,110
One in 68 children in this country

1454
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:18,278
are diagnosed with a form of autism.

1455
01:56:18,440 --> 01:56:19,953
But if you can put aside for a moment

1456
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:23,755
what your pediatrician and all
the other NTs have said about your son...

1457
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:25,239
What? NTs?

1458
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:27,597
Neurotypicals.

1459
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:29,438
The rest of us.

1460
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:32,312
What if we're wrong?

1461
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:34,990
What if we've been using the wrong tests

1462
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:38,470
to quantify intelligence
in children with autism?

1463
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:41,638
Your son's not less-than.

1464
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:44,599
He's different.

1465
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:49,313
Now, your expectations for your son
may change over time.

1466
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:53,911
They might include
marriage, children, self-sufficiency.

1467
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:55,638
And they might not.

1468
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:57,795
But I guarantee you,

1469
01:56:57,960 --> 01:57:01,794
if we let the world set expectations
for our children, they'll start low...

1470
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:04,999
And they'll stay there.

1471
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:10,353
Maybe your son's capable of
much more than we know.

1472
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:13,758
And maybe,

1473
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,116
just maybe,

1474
01:57:16,280 --> 01:57:17,952
he doesn't understand how to tell us.

1475
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:21,273
Or...

1476
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:24,874
We haven 't yet learned how to listen.

1477
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:53,715
Honey, for the hundredth time,
don't wander off like that.

1478
01:57:54,160 --> 01:57:56,515
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right. It's fine.

1479
01:57:56,680 --> 01:57:58,636
Can he visit with you
for a while, Justine?

1480
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:03,149
Okay, good. Come on, folks.
I'll give you the nickel tour.

1481
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:04,355
You okay with that?

1482
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:06,512
It's okay, hon. Come on.

1483
01:58:06,720 --> 01:58:08,392
No, they'll be fine.

1484
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:13,349
Justine's one of
our few full-time residents.

1485
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:15,835
She stopped talking 30 years ago.

1486
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,514
Communicates with
a digital translator now.

1487
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:21,157
Doctor, how is Harbor funded?

1488
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:24,716
We're fortunate to have
very generous private donors.

1489
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:26,199
I'll say they're generous.

1490
01:58:26,360 --> 01:58:27,600
Oh, why is that?

1491
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:29,512
That woman, Justine...

1492
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:31,910
- Yeah, my daughter.
- She's your daughter?

1493
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:34,350
The reason I started the institute.

1494
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:37,274
Justine's computer, it's a BX32.

1495
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:39,516
Water-cooled, 12 core.

1496
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:42,520
Oh, that's right.
You're a software engineer.

1497
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:46,434
Well, some of our donors
are more generous than others.

1498
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:48,596
Why? Is that a good computer?

1499
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:50,394
Good?

1500
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:53,633
Doc, she could backdoor
the Pentagon with that rig.

1501
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:59,394
Hello, dreamboat. Shall we chat?

1502
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:27,308
- Hi.
- Hi.

1503
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:28,754
Sign here, please.

1504
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:33,274
Thank you.

1505
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:36,548
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1505
01:59:37,305 --> 02:00:37,678
