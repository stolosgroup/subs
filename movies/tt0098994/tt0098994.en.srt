2
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,247
I WONDER WHERE
I'LL BE TOMORROW.

3
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:03,749
I WONDER WHY

4
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,251
I DIDN'T STAY
WHERE I WAS A WEEK AGO

5
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,253
AND A THOUSAND MILES
FROM HERE.

6
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,758
I WONDER WHETHER
I SHOULDN'T GO BACK.

7
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,260
THEY REALLY WEREN'T
DOING ME MUCH GOOD THERE.

8
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,138
IT WAS TOO OVERCROWDED,

9
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,266
TOO UNDERSTAFFED,
TOO HARD UP FOR MONEY.

10
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,353
BUT THEY WERE
NICE TO ME,

11
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,354
AND IF I HADN'T GOTTEN
SO DAMN RESTLESS,

12
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:30,275
IF THEY HADN'T MADE IT
SO EASY TO ESCAPE...

13
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,570
I'VE BEEN WALKING AWAY
FROM THINGS

14
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,072
FOR A LONG TIME,

15
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,281
EVER SINCE I COULDN'T
WALK AWAY FROM HIM.

16
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,075
HE WAS FOULING ME

17
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,785
AND GETTING ME
IN THE CLINCHES.

18
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,787
I COULDN'T
GET HIM TO STOP,

19
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,288
AND I COULDN'T
WALK AWAY.

20
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,501
ALWAYS COMES BACK
THE SAME.

21
00:02:47,536 --> 00:02:49,294
ABOVE THE ROAR
OF THE CROWD.

22
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:53,298
THAT ONE
WILDLY SHRIEKING VOICE.

23
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,300
HE'S PUNCHING
HIS BRAINS OUT.

24
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,301
IT'S MURDER.

25
00:02:56,343 --> 00:03:11,316
IT'S MURDER.

26
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:46,059
PERSONALIZED.
THAT'S NICE.

27
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:50,731
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
EXPENSIVE?

28
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,654
I SUPPOSE WITH THE VOLUME
IT MIGHT NOT BE THAT BAD.

29
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:58,447
THAT'S WHAT
IT'S ALL ABOUT--

30
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,157
VOLUME.

31
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,668
YOU SURE KNOW HOW
TO SERVE A BEER RIGHT.

32
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,546
ICE COLD.

33
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,632
NICE CLEAN GLASS.

34
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:21,678
YOU RUN A PRETTY TIGHT SHIP
HERE ALL AROUND.

35
00:04:21,713 --> 00:04:23,180
I CAN UNDERSTAND.

36
00:04:23,215 --> 00:04:48,205
YOU'RE PROBABLY
A LITTLE TIRED.

37
00:04:48,240 --> 00:05:09,226
HIYA, FAY.

38
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:13,230
RATHER WARM DAY.

39
00:05:13,265 --> 00:05:17,734
REALLY DEVELOPS
A PERSON'S THIRST, DOESN'T IT?

40
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:23,240
HERE YOU GO, FAY.

41
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:26,743
I WAS DRIVING SOUTH WITH THIS
FRIEND OF MINE, JACK BILLINGSLEY.

42
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,245
BIG REAL ESTATE FAMILY.

43
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,248
AND, UM...

44
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:32,749
ANYWAYS,
OUR CAR BROKE DOWN,

45
00:05:32,784 --> 00:05:35,210
SO I GO TO GET
A TOW TRUCK.

46
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,254
I CAN FIX
LOTS OF THINGS,

47
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,755
BUT, UH, CARS...

48
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:43,260
DARNED IF OLD CRAZY JACK
WASN'T GONE WHEN I GOT BACK.

49
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,220
I IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED
WAS HE--

50
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:48,265
JACK GOT THE CAR STARTED HIMSELF.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

51
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,767
NOW YOU'RE IN HERE
LOOKING FOR HIM

52
00:05:50,802 --> 00:05:54,730
WHILE HE'S OUT THERE
LOOKING FOR YOU.

53
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,772
YEAH.

54
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,275
DARN OLD CRAZY JACK
OUGHT TO KNOW

55
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,778
I'D COME INTO A PLACE
LIKE THIS LOOKING FOR HIM.

56
00:06:01,813 --> 00:06:03,280
PROBABLY
HAD AN ACCIDENT.

57
00:06:03,315 --> 00:06:07,784
IN FACT, I THINK
I READ ABOUT IT.

58
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:09,286
WHAT?

59
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:10,287
UH-HUH.

60
00:06:10,322 --> 00:06:12,789
HE AND A GIRL
NAMED JILL.

61
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:16,293
YOU READ ABOUT IT,
DIDN'T YOU, BERT?

62
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:17,294
YEAH.

63
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,296
THEY FELL DOWN A HILL,

64
00:06:19,331 --> 00:06:23,800
AND THEIR BUCKET
GOT BROKE.

65
00:06:23,835 --> 00:06:28,305
THEN THEY GOT
THEIR HEADS BUSTED.

66
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,309
WELL, I GUESS I JUST DON'T REALLY
GET THE POINT.

67
00:06:32,344 --> 00:06:34,770
REACH TO THE TOP
OF YOUR HEAD?

68
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,314
MAYBE YOU'LL FEEL IT.

69
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,815
OK, MAC.

70
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,317
DISAPPEAR.

71
00:06:40,352 --> 00:06:42,319
I HAVEN'T
DONE ANYTHING.

72
00:06:42,354 --> 00:06:43,820
I'VE BEEN ACTING
ALL RIGHT.

73
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:45,280
YOU GOT NO RIGHT--

74
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,281
BEAT IT.

75
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:49,326
I SAID I WAS WAITING
FOR A FRIEND.

76
00:06:49,361 --> 00:06:50,827
ALL RIGHT?

77
00:06:50,862 --> 00:06:52,829
I'VE BEEN POLITE.
YOU KNOW?

78
00:06:52,864 --> 00:06:54,790
LOOK,
I'M AN EX-SERVICEMAN.

79
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:56,333
I'VE BEEN TO COLLEGE.

80
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,336
I'VE BEEN TO JUNIOR COLLEGE
FOR 1 1/2 YEARS.

81
00:06:59,371 --> 00:07:01,338
HEY, HEY, HEY.
TAKE IT EASY.

82
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:02,840
KEEP YOUR HAIR ON.

83
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:08,720
ALL RIGHT.

84
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,264
HEY.

85
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:13,267
GET IN.

86
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:14,768
LOOK, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

87
00:07:14,803 --> 00:07:16,270
BERT'S NOT GOING
TO MAKE TROUBLE.

88
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:17,271
YEAH?

89
00:07:17,306 --> 00:07:19,273
HE'S NOT GOING
TO GET THE CHANCE.

90
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,275
I'M MOVING ON NOW.

91
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,776
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

92
00:07:22,811 --> 00:07:24,778
BERT'S THE LAST PERSON
TO CALL THE COPS.

93
00:07:24,813 --> 00:07:26,280
ANYWAY,

94
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:27,739
WE'RE NOT GOING
BACK THERE.

95
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:31,785
I'M TAKING YOU HOME
WITH ME.

96
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,287
HOME WITH YOU?

97
00:07:33,322 --> 00:07:40,294
IT'S NOT FAR FROM HERE.

98
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:47,759
COME ON.
THERE'S A GOOD BOY.

99
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,304
I WONDERED WHY SHE'S
ACTING SO FRIENDLY

100
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,805
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

101
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,308
SHE WAS NICE TO YOU
ONE MINUTE,

102
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:55,809
NEEDLING YOU THE NEXT.

103
00:07:55,844 --> 00:07:58,270
SEEMED TO DEPEND
ON HOW SHE FELT,

104
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,813
AND HOW SHE FELT

105
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:14,828
DEPENDED ON HOW MUCH WINE
SHE HAD IN HER.

106
00:08:14,863 --> 00:08:17,789
TICK, TICK, TICK, TICK,
TICK, TICK, TICK.

107
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,834
BY THE WAY,
I'M MRS. FAY ANDERSON.

108
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:23,837
VERY HAPPY TO MEET YOU,
MRS. FAY ANDERSON.

109
00:08:23,872 --> 00:08:25,339
I'M HAPPY
TO MEET YOU.

110
00:08:25,374 --> 00:08:27,341
IT'S A UNIQUE
PRIVILEGE

111
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:30,844
TO MEET A MAN
WITHOUT A NAME.

112
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,845
EXCUSE ME.

113
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,847
I'M, UH, KEVIN COLLINS.

114
00:08:33,882 --> 00:08:34,848
NO.

115
00:08:34,883 --> 00:08:36,850
NOTTHE
KEVIN COLLINS.

116
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:39,353
YEAH,
I GUESS MAYBE I AM.

117
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,355
DON'T FEEL BAD ABOUT IT.

118
00:08:41,390 --> 00:09:03,877
IT'S YOUR STORY,
SO STICK WITH IT.

119
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:05,879
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

120
00:09:05,914 --> 00:09:08,340
YOU WANT
A PIGGYBACK RIDE?

121
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:13,887
ACTUALLY, I WAS WONDERING
ABOUT MR. ANDERSON.

122
00:09:13,922 --> 00:09:15,389
HE'S DEAD, KEVIN.

123
00:09:15,424 --> 00:10:01,935
GONE TO HELL.

124
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:02,936
COLLINS.

125
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:06,940
COLLINS.

126
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,900
COLLIE.

127
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,902
MIND IF I CALL YOU
COLLIE?

128
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:10,944
ALL RIGHT.

129
00:10:10,979 --> 00:10:13,447
A LOT OF PEOPLE
CALL ME COLLIE.

130
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:15,949
THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU LOOK LIKE ONE.

131
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:18,410
STUPID AND SHAGGY
WITH A BIG, LONG NOSE

132
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,955
TO POKE IN OTHER
PEOPLE'S BUSINESS.

133
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,457
I WASN'T, UH...

134
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:25,459
FORGET IT.

135
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:34,468
CHEERS.

136
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:37,471
YOU'RE VERY FAST
WITH YOUR MITTS, COLLIE.

137
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:39,473
FAST AND EFFICIENT.

138
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:41,975
YOU EVER FIGHT
PROFESSIONALLY?

139
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,978
I HAD A FEW FIGHTS.

140
00:10:45,013 --> 00:10:46,480
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED,

141
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:49,441
STOP A FEW TOO MANY
WITH YOUR HEAD?

142
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,985
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING,
MRS. ANDERSON.

143
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,988
I'D LIKE TO CORRECT
AN ERRONEOUS IMPRESSION

144
00:10:55,023 --> 00:10:57,491
YOU SEEM TO HAVE ABOUT ME.

145
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:59,493
I'M NOT AT ALL STUPID.

146
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:04,498
I MAY SOUND LIKE I AM,
BUT I'M NOT.

147
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:07,000
WELL, YOU SWEAR
TO THAT, COLLIE.

148
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:08,961
HAVE IT SIGNED
AND NOTARIZED,

149
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,005
AND I'LL TAKE IT
UNDER CONSIDERATION.

150
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,507
I'M NOT STUPID,

151
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,008
AND I DON'T LIKE

152
00:11:15,043 --> 00:11:18,470
FOR PEOPLE
TO TREAT ME LIKE I AM.

153
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,097
MOST OF MY LIFE
I'VE BEEN IN PLACES WHERE--

154
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:25,519
I'VE WORKED IN PLACES WHERE IT'S
DIFFICULT TO CONVERSE WITH SOMEONE

155
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:27,020
ON EQUAL FOOTING.

156
00:11:27,055 --> 00:11:28,981
IT'S HARD TO CARRY ON
AN INTELLIGENT CONVERSATION,

157
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,024
SO AFTER A WHILE,
YOU LOSE THE KNACK.

158
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:32,025
SHUT UP.

159
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,528
BUT I'M--

160
00:11:34,563 --> 00:12:06,560
SHUT UP.
SOMEONE'S COMING.

161
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:11,565
THINK YOU COULD FIX
A FEW THINGS UP AROUND HERE, COLLIE?

162
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,066
WHO WAS THAT?

163
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:15,068
NOSY, NOSY.

164
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:19,031
YOU CAN USE
MY HUSBAND'S WORK CLOTHES.

165
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:23,577
YOU'RE AROUND HIS SIZE.

166
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:26,079
I DIDN'T SAY
THAT I'D STAY.

167
00:12:26,114 --> 00:12:29,041
YOU SEEM TO FORGET
I'M WAITING FOR A FRIEND--

169

YOU MIGHT EVEN GET THESE
OLD TREES WORKING AGAIN.

170
00:12:33,622 --> 00:12:35,589
WHAT ARE THEY?

DATE PALMS, COLLIE.

172
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,593
MY HUSBAND IMPORTED THEM

174
00:12:43,131 --> 00:12:44,598
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEM?

175
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:47,100
THEY'VE ALL DRIED UP,

176
00:12:47,135 --> 00:13:06,036
WITHERING AWAY
FROM LACK OF ATTENTION.

177
00:13:06,071 --> 00:13:15,045
IT'S NOT MUCH,
BUT IT'S PRIVATE.

178
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,048
DON'T GET THE WRONG
IDEA ABOUT ME, COLLIE.

179
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,550
WE JUST MET.

180
00:13:19,585 --> 00:13:21,510
I DON'T HAVE
ANY IDEAS YET.

181
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:24,054
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I FORGOT.

182
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:27,057
IN ANY CASE, YOU CAN
START WORK TOMORROW.

183
00:13:27,092 --> 00:13:31,019
YOU GET CLEANED UP,
AND I'LL BUY YOU DINNER.

184
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:37,568
I'M IN THE MOOD
FOR A DRINK.

185
00:13:37,603 --> 00:13:39,069
OH, AND COLLIE, DARLING.

186
00:13:39,104 --> 00:13:41,530
DO YOUR FAY A FAVOR
AND DON'T SHAVE.

187
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:51,039
I LIKE

BEFORE MY OLD MAN
KICKED THE BUCKET,

190
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,598
WE USED TO COME HERE
ONCE A WEEK.

191
00:14:07,633 --> 00:14:14,605
HE LOVED TO TIE ONE ON
AND DANCE.

192
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,106
DO YOU WANT TO DANCE?

193
00:14:16,141 --> 00:14:18,609
I MEAN,
I DON'T DANCE,

194
00:14:18,644 --> 00:14:58,649
BUT IF YOU WANT
TO DANCE...

195
00:14:58,684 --> 00:15:02,653
I THOUGHT
THAT WAS YOU, FAY.

YOU CAN CALL ME UNCLE BUD
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

198
00:15:08,193 --> 00:15:09,660
DON'T MIND ME.

199
00:15:09,695 --> 00:15:11,620
I SAW YOU AND FAY DANCING,

200
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:14,164
AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE NICE TO MEET YOU.

201
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:16,667
FAY SAID YOU WERE
GOING TO HELP HER OUT

202
00:15:16,702 --> 00:15:18,669
WHEN I CAME BY
THIS AFTERNOON.

203
00:15:18,704 --> 00:15:19,670
YES, SIR.

204
00:15:19,705 --> 00:15:21,129
NICE TO MEET YOU.

205
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,173
HEY, MISS.

206
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:26,677
I'LL HAVE A BOTTLE OF RED
AND ONE MORE GLASS.

207
00:15:26,712 --> 00:15:28,679
DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
THIS AFTERNOON

208
00:15:28,714 --> 00:15:31,640
WHEN YOU TOLD ME
YOU HAD A KEVIN COLLINS

209
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:32,641
HELPING YOU OUT.

210
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,184
DIDN'T THINK MUCH
ABOUT IT.

211
00:15:34,219 --> 00:15:36,687
I SAW YOU TWO
ON THE DANCE FLOOR,

212
00:15:36,722 --> 00:15:39,189
AND IT HIT ME LIKE
THE KID'S LEFT HOOK.

213
00:15:39,224 --> 00:15:41,149
THAT'S WHAT
THEY CALLED HIM--

214

KID COLLINS.

215
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,195
WHEN WAS THAT LAST FIGHT
OF YOURS, KID,

216
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,198
THE BIG ONE?

217
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:50,701
IT WAS, UH, SOME TIME AGO.

218
00:15:50,736 --> 00:15:52,661
IT WAS, UH...

219
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:56,707
IT WASN'T EVEN
A BIG FIGHT, SIR.

220
00:15:56,742 --> 00:15:58,208
SURE, KID, SURE.

221
00:15:58,243 --> 00:16:00,210
BUT EVERY FIGHT'S
A BIG ONE.

222
00:16:00,245 --> 00:16:01,670
BEING IN THE RING.

223
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:04,715
FACING SOMEONE WHO WANTS
TO KILL YOU.

224
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,216
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

225
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:07,718
WHY AM I TELLING YOU?

226
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:09,720
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND, SIR.

227
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:11,180
CUT OUT THE "SIR" STUFF.

228
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:13,724
TELL ME WHEN
SPORTS AT 11:00'S OVER.

229
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,225
WHERE YOU GOING?

230
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,728
TO TALK TO A MIRROR.

231
00:16:17,763 --> 00:16:21,190
SURE AM GLAD YOU DECIDED
TO SETTLE DOWN, KID.

232
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:22,733
NOW YOU GOT SOME FRIENDS,

233
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,736
PEOPLE WHO ADMIRE YOU,
TAKE AN INTEREST IN YOU.

234
00:16:25,771 --> 00:16:28,238
SETTLE DOWN?

235
00:16:28,273 --> 00:16:30,741
YEAH, TAKE IT EASY
FOR A WHILE.

236
00:16:30,776 --> 00:16:31,700
REST UP.

237
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,744
KEEP FAY
OUT OF TROUBLE.

238
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,246
I GOT A FEELING
I MIGHT BE ABLE

239
00:16:36,281 --> 00:16:39,249
TO PUT YOU
NEXT TO SOMETHING PRETTY GOOD.

240
00:16:39,284 --> 00:16:41,710
LOOK, SIR.

241
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,253
UNCLE BUD.

242
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:46,757
I APPRECIATE YOU
WANTING TO HELP, BUT...

243
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:48,759
GET IT OFF YOUR CHEST.

244
00:16:48,794 --> 00:16:50,761
WELL...

245
00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:53,764
YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME.

246
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,266
I KNOW PEOPLE.
I KNOW WHAT THEY'LL DO

247
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:57,768
AND WHAT THEY WON'T DO.

248
00:16:57,803 --> 00:17:00,270
I FIGURE YOU'VE HAD
A TOUGH TIME,

249
00:17:00,305 --> 00:17:03,273
BUT YOU'RE SHARP, NERVY,

250
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:06,276
KNOW A GOOD ANGLE
WHEN YOU SEE IT,

251
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:09,279
AND YOU HAVE WHAT IT
TAKES TO FINISH IT OUT.

252
00:17:09,314 --> 00:17:10,781
YEAH, SURE.

253
00:17:10,816 --> 00:17:13,784
I USED TO BE
A DETECTIVE.

254
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,285
I WAS.

255
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,288
PUT A LOT OF GUYS
NEXT TO SOME GOOD DEALS.

256
00:17:18,323 --> 00:17:21,250
SOME OF THEM HAD EXPERIENCE.
SOME DIDN'T.

257
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,794
A LOT NEVER
EVEN DONE A DEAL,

258
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,295
DIDN'T KNOW
THEY COULD,

259
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:28,799
UNTIL YOUR OLD UNCLE BUD HERE
SHOWED THEM HOW.

260
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:30,801
YOU'RE NOT
A DETECTIVE NOW?

261
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:32,761
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

262
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:34,805
WHEN YOU NEED
TO KNOW IT.

263
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,806
I WAS--

264
00:17:35,841 --> 00:17:37,307
ONE MORE THING.

265
00:17:37,342 --> 00:17:38,809
MAKE SURE
YOU SLEEP ALONE.

266
00:17:38,844 --> 00:17:41,770
MAYBE I BETTER
CLEAR OUT OF HERE NOW.

267
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:47,317
DON'T TAKE IT
PERSONALLY.

268
00:17:47,352 --> 00:17:49,820
I, UH...

269
00:17:49,855 --> 00:17:55,826
I'M GOING TO LEAVE
YOU AND FAY ALONE.

270
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:58,328
WELL, COLLIE,
MY BLUSHING BOY,

271
00:17:58,363 --> 00:17:59,830
WHAT DID I MISS?

272
00:17:59,865 --> 00:18:02,833
PLENTY.

273
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:06,336
REALLY.

274
00:18:06,371 --> 00:18:26,857
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

275
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:28,358
GO AWAY, COLLIE.

276
00:18:28,393 --> 00:18:31,320
THIS LITTLE SCHEME'S
BEEN COOKING FOR MONTHS,

277
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:32,821
AND IF YOU LEAVE,

278
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:39,870
IT'LL GO ON COOKING
TILL IT BOILS AWAY.

279
00:18:39,905 --> 00:18:42,873
I'D ASK YOU
TO STAY THE NIGHT

280
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:45,375
IF IT WASN'T
FOR UNCLE BUD.

281
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,879
I DON'T WANT HIM TALKING
YOU INTO THIS MESS.

282
00:18:48,914 --> 00:18:49,880
IF HE SAW YOU...

283
00:18:49,915 --> 00:18:51,340
FAY.

284
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,884
HERE. TAKE THE BOTTLE.
YOU LOOK LONELY,

285
00:18:53,926 --> 00:19:09,399
AND A BOTTLE CAN BE
A LOT OF COMPANY.

286
00:19:09,434 --> 00:19:14,905
WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN TO YOU, FAY?

287
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,406
NOTHING.

288
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:21,870
SAME AS BEEN HAPPENING
SINCE MY HUSBAND DIED.

289
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:23,413
OH, NEVER MIND, COLLIE.

290
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:25,916
JUST GO AND KEEP GOING.

291
00:19:25,951 --> 00:19:27,417
GO. GO. GO.

292
00:19:27,452 --> 00:19:52,401
FLY AWAY INTO THE NIGHT
UP TO THE MOON.

293
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:55,445
WHETHER SHE WAS
WATCHING ME OR NOT,

294
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,947
I DON'T KNOW.

295
00:19:56,982 --> 00:19:59,950
I ONLY KNEW
THAT I WAS MOVING AGAIN,

296
00:19:59,985 --> 00:20:02,411
AWAY FROM HER
AND UNCLE BUD.

297
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:05,455
I FELT KIND OF SAD
IN A WAY,

298
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:15,382
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
I FELT GOOD.

299
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:17,885
DON'T FLASH THAT BOTTLE
AROUND SO MUCH, HUH?

300
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:22,890
SOME HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
COME IN HERE AND PFFT!

301
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:25,893
UM, MAN. HOW ABOUT--
HOW ABOUT A RIDE?

302
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:29,897
SORRY. THE COMPANY
SAYS NO RIDERS.

303
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,398
MAN, I COULD--

304
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,401
I COULD RIDE
IN THE BACK,

305
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:37,404
JUST TILL DAYLIGHT.

306
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:48,415
WE'LL PROBABLY RUN INTO
THAT CRAZY JACK BILLINGSLEY.

307
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:49,917
PLEASE, MAC.

308
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,418
CLEAR OUT, WILL YOU?

309
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,421
WHAT WILL PEOPLE THINK,
FOR GOD'S SAKE?

310
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:57,424
THEY COME HERE, AND YOU
JABBER AWAY ON THEM.

311
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:58,425
I'M SORRY.

312
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:01,428
I WON'T SAY
ANOTHER WORD TO ANYONE.

313
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,431
I'LL JUST, UH,
WAIT HERE QUIETLY

314
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:06,934
TILL IT GETS
A LITTLE LIGHTER.

315
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:09,937
LEAVE THE COUNTER.
SIT IN THE BACK.

316
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:12,439
CERTAINLY.
I'D BE GLAD TO.

317
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:29,456
UGH.

318
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:30,958
SORRY.

319
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:31,959
FEEL OK?

320
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,461
LIKE ME TO
ORDER YOU SOMETHING?

321
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:35,963
NO, THANK YOU.

322
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,965
YOU OUGHT
TO EAT SOMETHING

323
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,967
OR AT LEAST
HAVE SOME COFFEE.

324
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,969
I THINK I'LL SIT HERE

325
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,972
AND WAIT FOR MY FRIEND
JACK BILLINGSLEY.

326
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,473
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY
WITH ME.

327
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:47,975
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

328
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:50,978
WELL...

329
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,104
I SEE.

330
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,106
BEEN GETTING ALONG
ALL RIGHT?

331
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:57,985
ABOUT LIKE ALWAYS.

332
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:01,488
PRETTY GOOD,
I GUESS.

333
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:05,993
NOT REALLY GOOD,
YOU KNOW, BUT ALL RIGHT.

334
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:10,497
HOW LONG SINCE YOU
WERE UNDER COMMITMENT?

335
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:14,001
IT'S BEEN A FEW, UH...

336
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,503
MORE THAN A YEAR NOW.

337
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:19,006
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO BACK?

338
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,508
DON'T YOU THINK
YOU SHOULD GO BACK?

339
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:25,012
YEAH. I GUESS I SHOULD.

340
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:27,014
KIND OF.

341
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:30,517
I HAVEN'T BEEN IN
ANY TROUBLE OR ANYTHING.

342
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,519
YOU A DOCTOR?

343
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:35,522
YES. AND I THINK
YOU SHOULD GO BACK,

344
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:38,525
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU'VE GOT SOME FRIEND

345
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:41,028
OR FAMILY MEMBER
WHO CAN HELP YOU.

346
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:42,529
I HAVEN'T.

347
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:45,032
I WISH I COULD HELP YOU,

348
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,533
BUT THERE ARE LIMITS

349
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:50,037
TO HOW MUCH EACH OF US
CAN GIVE OF OURSELVES.

350
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:52,539
WELL, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME, DOCTOR.

351
00:22:52,581 --> 00:23:07,554
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

352
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:09,556
YOU SURE YOU'LL BE OK?

353
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:12,559
YOU LAY OFF THE BOOZE
AND BEHAVE YOURSELF.

354
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:13,810
YES, SIR.

355
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:16,647
YOU ARE, LIKE HELL.
HOW CAN YOU?

356
00:23:16,682 --> 00:23:19,149
WHY THE HELL
SHOULD YOU?

357
00:23:19,184 --> 00:23:42,589
COME ON.

358
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:45,092
HE HAD A NICE HOUSE.

359
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,593
MY OWN ROOM.

360
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:50,597
NOBODY STARING AT YOU.

361
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:53,600
EXCEPT THAT I KEPT
THINKING ABOUT FAY

362
00:23:53,642 --> 00:24:00,107
AND WORRYING ABOUT HER.

363
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:01,608
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

364
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:46,153
TAKE CARE
GETTING HOME NOW.

365
00:24:46,195 --> 00:24:48,655
HEY.

366
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:51,158
COLLIE, I WAS
GOING TO ASK YOU,

367
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,659
IN CASE THE HOSPITAL

368
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:55,662
SHOULD REFUSE
TO SEND FOR YOU,

369
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:58,665
IF THEY DON'T FEEL
ABLE TO, THAT IS,

370
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:00,167
BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE...

371
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:06,173
YES, DOC?

372
00:25:06,215 --> 00:25:08,175
COLLIE,
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL

373
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:10,677
ABOUT STAYING ON HERE
WITH ME?

374
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,680
YOU'D BE
A BIG HELP TO ME.

375
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:15,682
I'D BE OF HELP TO YOU.

376
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:19,186
IT WOULD BE A FINE ARRANGEMENT
FOR BOTH OF US.

377
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:20,687
WELL...

378
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:22,189
DOC...

379
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:23,690
YOU SEE, MY FRIEND,

380
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:27,694
YOUR JUDGMENT
JUST ISN'T GOOD.

381
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:31,698
A MAN IN YOUR CONDITION
IS EASILY INFLUENCED

382
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,200
AND, BROADLY SPEAKING,

383
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:37,204
DEPENDENT ON
THE GOOD WILL OF OTHERS.

384
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:45,212
WELL, YOU CAN SEE
THE POTENTIAL FOR TRAGEDY.

385
00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:48,215
I DON'T KNOW, DOC.

386
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:52,719
I NEVER
REALLY HURT ANYONE.

387
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:56,223
I NEVER DID ANYTHING
REALLY BAD.

388
00:25:56,265 --> 00:26:01,728
WHAT DO YOU REALLY
CALL BAD, COLLIE?

389
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,230
NEVER MIND.

390
00:26:03,272 --> 00:26:05,232
I'M SURE
YOU'VE DONE FINE,

391
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:06,733
HARD AS IT WAS.

392
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:10,237
AND FROM NOW ON,
YOU'LL DO EVEN BETTER.

393
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:13,240
YOU STAY HERE
FOR A YEAR OR SO,

394
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:15,742
HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES,

395
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:18,245
AND, UH...

396
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:54,781
YOU'LL SEE.

397
00:26:54,823 --> 00:28:19,867
COME ON!

398
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,368
OH, COLLIE.

399
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:28,375
YOU CRAZY, SILLY SWEET.

400
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:30,377
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU, HONEY?

401
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:33,380
I JUST HAPPENED TO BE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

402
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:39,386
I BROUGHT YOU
A PRESENT--SOME WINE.

403
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:40,888
WELL, COME ON IN,

404
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:47,895
AND WE'LL
DRINK YOUR CLOTHES.

405
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:52,399
I'M GLAD YOU
CAME BACK, COLLIE.

406
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:55,903
I WISH YOU HADN'T.
I PRAYED YOU WOULDN'T.

407
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:59,406
BUT I'M GLAD.

408
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:02,910
I'M GLAD, TOO.

409
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:04,411
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

410
00:29:04,453 --> 00:29:08,916
IT JUST SEEMED
LIKE I HAD TO.

411
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:13,420
AFTER I MET YOU,
AND, UH...

412
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:14,421
AND EVERYTHING...

413
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:18,425
I JUST, UM...

414
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:20,928
COULDN'T...

415
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:23,931
COULDN'T WHAT, COLLIE?

416
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:29,436
COULDN'T KEEP DOING
THE SAME THING.

417
00:29:29,478 --> 00:29:32,940
IT'S LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS...

418
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:36,944
THAT YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO DO.

419
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:40,948
BUT, UH...

420
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:44,952
YOU KNOW IT'S
GOING TO BE DIFFERENT.

421
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:49,456
SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE.

422
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:52,960
FEELS GOOD
WITH YOU, FAY.

423
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:58,966
YOU FEEL GOOD.

424
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:02,469
WHAT DO
THE WORDS MEAN, KID?

425
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:04,471
WHAT'S GOOD? WHAT'S BAD?

426
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:08,475
I'D SAY IT'D BE BAD
FOR A NICE GUY LIKE YOU

427
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:11,478
TO HAVE TO GO ON
LIKE HE'S BEEN GOING.

428
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,980
IT'D BE GOOD

429
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:15,482
IF YOU NEVER
HAD TO WORRY ABOUT MONEY

430
00:30:15,524 --> 00:30:17,484
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

431
00:30:17,526 --> 00:30:19,486
I GUESS IT WOULD BE.

432
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:22,489
ACTUALLY, YOU WOULDN'T
WANT TO HURT ANYONE.

433
00:30:22,531 --> 00:30:24,491
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO.

434
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:27,494
JUST BE A CASE
OF PUTTING PRESSURE

435
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:29,496
ON CERTAIN PEOPLE,

436
00:30:29,538 --> 00:30:31,498
PEOPLE THAT
HAVE MORE MONEY

437
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,001
THAN THEY KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH.

438
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:35,502
MAKING THEM COME ACROSS.

439
00:30:35,544 --> 00:30:49,391
THAT'D BE OK,
WOULDN'T IT?

440
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:50,893
DAMN SHAME.

441
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:52,394
WHAT?

442
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:53,896
ALL THAT MONEY.

443
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:57,900
THEIR KIDS HAVE TO MAKE
AN APPOINTMENT TO PLAY.

444
00:30:57,941 --> 00:30:59,401
OUR BOY VANDERVENTER,

445
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:02,905
BOOKED HERE SATURDAYS
1:00 TO 4:00...

446
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:07,409
PUTTING PRACTICE.

447
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:08,911
CHAUFFEUR'S HERE
AT 3:45,

448
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:11,413
NEVER A MINUTE EARLIER.

449
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:14,416
THAT MEANS BY 3:40,

450
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:15,918
YOU'VE GOT
TO BE AIRBORNE.

451
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:16,919
AIRBORNE?

452
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,421
IT'S A QUICK
IN AND OUT.

453
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:21,924
YOU SHOW UP DRESSED
IN THE UNIFORM,

454
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:24,927
TIP YOUR HAT
TO THE PLAY SUPERVISOR,

455
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:27,429
SCOOP UP LITTLE CHARLIE,
AND AWAY YOU GO.

456
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:30,432
YOU'VE GOT IT PRETTY WELL
ORGANIZED, UNCLE BUD.

457
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:34,436
DOWN TO THE TEE, KID.

458
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:36,939
WITH MY CONNECTIONS
INSIDE THE DEPARTMENT...

459
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,942
I'LL KNOW EVERY MOVE
THE COPS ARE MAKING

460
00:31:39,983 --> 00:33:28,759
BEFORE THEY MAKE THEM.

461
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,260
I'M SORRY, DOC.

462
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:32,763
I JUST
COULDN'T STAY THERE.

463
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:34,264
YOU KNOW I COULDN'T.

464
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:36,266
JUST WOULDN'T BE RIGHT.

465
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:38,769
I WOULD HAVE WORRIED
ABOUT IT.

466
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,771
THAT'S NOT
VERY STRAIGHT-THINKING.

467
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:43,273
THAT'S THE KIND
OF MIXED-UP,

468
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:46,777
ONE-SIDED THINKING THAT
CAN GET YOU IN TROUBLE.

469
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:48,278
I'M NOT MIXED UP.

470
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,282
JUST SOMETHING
I HAD TO DO, SO I DID IT.

471
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:54,785
WITH A GALLON
OF RED WINE?

472
00:33:54,827 --> 00:33:56,286
THAT WASN'T FOR ME.

473
00:33:56,328 --> 00:33:57,788
IT WAS A PRESENT.

474
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:01,792
I BOUGHT IT FOR THESE PEOPLE
THAT I'M WORKING FOR.

475
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:04,294
I MADE A FEW
DISCREET INQUIRIES.

476
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:07,297
I KNOW WHO LIVES
IN THIS PLACE.

477
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:09,800
SHE'S A WIDOW,
ISN'T SHE, COLLIE?

478
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:11,301
SHE NEEDS ME, DOC.

479
00:34:11,343 --> 00:34:13,303
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS

480
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:15,305
TO HAVE SOMEONE
REALLY NEED YOU

481
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:17,808
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN YOUR LIFE?

482
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,810
I KNOW.

483
00:34:19,852 --> 00:34:22,813
BUT, COLLIE, IT
STILL ISN'T RIGHT.

484
00:34:22,855 --> 00:34:24,314
OH, IT MUST BE

485
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:27,317
BECAUSE WHEN I WOKE UP
THIS MORNING,

486
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,819
I WAS GLAD.

487
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:31,822
I WAS GLAD
TO BE ALIVE, DOC,

488
00:34:31,864 --> 00:34:34,825
BECAUSE I KNEW SOMEONE ELSE
WOULD BE GLAD...

489
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:37,327
AND...

490
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:40,831
PEOPLE
JUST AREN'T GLAD...

491
00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:42,332
UNLESS YOU NEED THEM.

492
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:45,836
THEY MAY BE NICE AND
FRIENDLY LIKE YOU WERE,

493
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:48,338
BUT IF
THEY DON'T NEED YOU,

494
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,340
THEY REALLY CAN'T BE GLAD.

495
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:51,842
THEY REALLY CAN'T CARE

496
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:54,344
WHETHER YOU'RE
ALIVE OR NOT.

497
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:56,847
AND WHEN
NO ONE ELSE CARES,

498
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:00,350
AND WHEN THAT GOES ON
YEAR AFTER YEAR, DOC,

499
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:06,356
WHEN NOBODY CARES...

500
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:08,859
ALL RIGHT, COLLIE.

501
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:11,862
I'LL AGREE TO YOUR
STAYING ON HERE,

502
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:13,864
BUT SHE'LL
HAVE TO BE TOLD

503
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:15,365
ABOUT
YOUR CONDITION.

504
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:17,868
I CAN DO IT
IN SUCH A WAY

505
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,870
THAT SHE
WON'T BE ALARMED.

506
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:21,371
WON'T BE ALARMED? WHAT?

507
00:35:21,413 --> 00:35:22,873
YOU'RE GOING TO TELL HER

508
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:25,876
I'M ON THE LOOSE FROM
AN INSANE ASYLUM?

509
00:35:25,918 --> 00:35:28,378
YOU DON'T THINK
SHE'LL BE ALARMED?

510
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,381
I THINK I CAN POSE
THE SITUATION

511
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:32,883
MUCH BETTER THAN THAT.

512
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:36,887
I'D BE VIOLATING MY DUTY
IF I DIDN'T DO IT.

513
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:40,390
DON'T DO IT, DOC.

514
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:43,393
BECAUSE IF
YOU DO THIS TO ME,

515
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:57,908
IF YOU MAKE ME LOSE HER...

516
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:00,410
WELL, ALL RIGHT,
MY FRIEND.

517
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:01,912
FOR THE TIME BEING,

518
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:05,916
UNTIL YOU CAN GET
A LITTLE BETTER SETTLED AT LEAST,

519
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:11,922
I WON'T SEE HER.

520
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:12,923
I...

521
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:36,446
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO THANK YOU.

522
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:37,948
I WENT BACK

523
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,951
TO TRYING TO GET
THE TREES WORKING AGAIN,

524
00:36:40,993 --> 00:36:42,452
BUT NOT FOR LONG.

525
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:43,954
I WAS TOO WEAK.

526
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:45,455
THE STRAIN I'D BEEN UNDER

527
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:48,458
WHEN I THOUGHT
HE WAS GOING TO SEE FAY

528
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,963
HAD TAKEN TOO MUCH
OUT OF ME.

529

530
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:57,467

KID.

532
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:02,472
YOU'RE CLEAR
ON ALL THIS, RIGHT?

533
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:03,974
YES.

534
00:37:04,016 --> 00:37:05,475
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

535
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:07,978
I WAS JUST THINKING.

536
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:08,979
YEAH?

537
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:10,480
I WAS WONDERING

538
00:37:10,522 --> 00:37:13,483
IF MAYBE THERE'S SOME WAY
WE COULD DO THIS

539
00:37:13,525 --> 00:37:17,488
WITHOUT ACTUALLY
GOING THROUGH WITH THE KIDNAPPING.

540
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:19,490
WE'LL FAKE IT,
START TO,

541
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:22,993
AND THEN YOU COME IN
AND RESCUE THE BOY,

542
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:25,996
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

543
00:37:26,038 --> 00:37:29,500
AND THEN WHAT?

544
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:33,504
FAMILY PROBABLY
GIVE YOU A REWARD.

545
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:35,005
LESS MONEY TO SPLIT,

546
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:38,509
BUT FAY AND I COULD
GET ALONG WITH LESS.

547
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:41,011
YEAH, UM...

548

BECOME A HERO, THOUGH,

549

550

NOT GOING TO WORK.

554
00:38:00,072 --> 00:38:03,033
JUST CAN'T
BE DONE THAT WAY.

555
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:05,035
YEAH. I GUESS
YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:28,003
IF WE WEREN'T THERE,
YOU WOULD'VE TAKEN THE WRONG BOY.

808
01:00:28,045 --> 01:00:29,505
HASN'T IT
OCCURRED TO YOU

809
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:35,093
THAT MAYBE I PICKED UP
THE WRONG KID ON PURPOSE?

810
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:39,014
WHAT?

811
01:00:39,056 --> 01:00:41,016
I AM GETTING FED UP.

812
01:00:41,051 --> 01:00:44,520
WHAT THE HELL
IS HE TALKING ABOUT?

813
01:00:44,561 --> 01:00:48,524
THE KID'S JUST GOT
THE WRONG SLANT ON THINGS.

814
01:00:48,565 --> 01:00:49,525
OH, DO I?

815
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:50,526
DOES HE?

816
01:00:50,561 --> 01:00:54,029
YEAH. DON'T YOU
REMEMBER THE OTHER DAY?

817
01:00:54,071 --> 01:00:57,032
WE TALKED ALL ABOUT IT,
YOU REMEMBER,

818
01:00:57,074 --> 01:01:01,036
ABOUT WE WOULDN'T ACTUALLY
GO THROUGH WITH THE JOB.

819
01:01:01,071 --> 01:01:06,041
I'D STEP IN AT THE LAST MINUTE
AND BE THE BIG HERO

820
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:08,544
AND COLLECT THE REWARD,
ET CETERA.

821
01:01:08,585 --> 01:01:10,546
BUT IT
COULDN'T BE DONE.

822
01:01:10,581 --> 01:01:19,054
SOMEONE WOULD HAVE
TO GET CAUGHT OR--

823
01:01:19,096 --> 01:01:23,058
SO THAT'S
WHAT YOU THINK?

824
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:25,561
THAT'S WHAT
YOU THINK OF ME?

825
01:01:25,602 --> 01:01:29,064
WHY NOT?

826
01:01:29,106 --> 01:01:31,567
WELL, SURE.
WHY NOT?

827
01:01:31,602 --> 01:01:33,569
IF A PERSON WON'T STOP
AT KIDNAPPING,

828
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:35,571
WHY SHOULD SHE
STOP AT MURDER?

829
01:01:35,612 --> 01:01:36,572
FAY.

830
01:01:36,613 --> 01:01:39,074
BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO'VE
BECOME WHAT WE HAVE,

831
01:01:39,116 --> 01:01:42,578
WE WERE BOUND
TO ARRIVE AT IT SOONER OR LATER.

832
01:01:42,613 --> 01:01:45,581
YOU ARE DAMN WRONG
ABOUT NOT BEING STUPID.

833
01:01:45,622 --> 01:01:49,585
YOU ARE, I AM, AND UNCLE BUD DECIDED--
[INDISTINCT SHOUTING]

834
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:58,594
YOU KNOW, UH, WE SHOULD REALLY STOP
THIS MOPING AROUND.

835
01:01:58,635 --> 01:02:02,097
LOOK, WE HAD A LITTLE
MISUNDERSTANDING.

836
01:02:02,132 --> 01:02:04,391
AND IT'S ALL OVER NOW.

837
01:02:04,433 --> 01:02:07,394
WE GOT WHAT WE WANTED.

838
01:02:07,436 --> 01:02:10,898
WE ARE ABOUT TO COLLECT.

839
01:02:10,939 --> 01:02:12,399
YES, GENTLEMEN AND LADY,

840
01:02:12,441 --> 01:02:15,903
NOW WE CAN COLLECT.

841
01:02:15,944 --> 01:02:21,909
WELL, THAT'S
JUST WHAT I SAID.

842
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:24,411
I GOT AN IDEA, KID.

843
01:02:24,453 --> 01:02:26,413
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

844
01:02:26,455 --> 01:02:28,415
IF IT'S OK WITH YOU,

845
01:02:28,457 --> 01:02:31,418
THE FIRST THING
I OUGHT TO DO IS THE CAR.

846
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:34,421
I CAN HAVE IT SCRAPPED IN ONE HOUR.

847
01:02:34,463 --> 01:02:35,923
IN THE MEANTIME,

848
01:02:35,964 --> 01:02:37,424
I SEND
THE RANSOM NOTE.

849
01:02:37,466 --> 01:02:40,427
LOOK, WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH ALL THIS.

850
01:02:40,469 --> 01:02:42,930
I JUST DON'T
WANT YOU TO GET

851
01:02:42,971 --> 01:02:44,431
ANY MORE
WRONG IDEAS.

852
01:02:44,473 --> 01:02:48,936
DON'T GIVE ME
ANY REASONS, AND I WON'T.

853
01:02:48,977 --> 01:04:22,029
OK.

854
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:25,032
DID HE
EAT ALL RIGHT?

855
01:04:25,073 --> 01:04:28,035
DON'T TELL ME
YOU DON'T KNOW.

856
01:04:28,076 --> 01:04:30,537
HE MUST HAVE
BEEN PRETTY HUNGRY.

857
01:04:30,579 --> 01:04:32,039
IT HADN'T
OCCURRED TO ME.

858
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:34,541
I SEE NOW THAT
HE MUST HAVE BEEN.

859
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:36,543
I'VE BEEN
THINKING THINGS OVER.

860
01:04:36,585 --> 01:04:40,047
I THINK MAYBE I
WAS WRONG ABOUT TODAY.

861
01:04:40,088 --> 01:04:41,548
YOU THINK SO?

862
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:42,549
MAYBE?

863
01:04:42,591 --> 01:04:45,052
ABOUT YOU,
NOT ABOUT UNCLE BUD.

864
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:48,055
I KNOW WHAT
HE PLANNED ON DOING.

865
01:04:48,096 --> 01:04:52,559
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU HAD TO BE IN ON IT.

866
01:04:52,601 --> 01:04:53,560
WELL...

867
01:04:53,602 --> 01:04:54,561
I MIGHT NOT HAVE.

868
01:04:54,603 --> 01:04:56,063
I MAYBE DIDN'T.

869
01:04:56,104 --> 01:04:57,564
IT'S ALGEBRA,
ISN'T IT?

870
01:04:57,606 --> 01:05:00,067
TWO MINUSES
GIVE YOU A PLUS.

871
01:05:00,108 --> 01:05:02,569
LOOK.

872
01:05:02,611 --> 01:05:04,571
DID YOU
OR DIDN'T YOU?

873
01:05:04,613 --> 01:05:06,073
JUST TELL ME.

874
01:05:06,114 --> 01:05:10,077
IF YOU HAVE TO ASK
FOR THE ANSWER, IT DOESN'T COUNT.

875
01:05:10,118 --> 01:05:12,579
WELL, THEN YOU
TELL ME THIS.

876
01:05:12,621 --> 01:05:15,082
ABOUT YOU FINDING
OUT ABOUT ME,

877
01:05:15,123 --> 01:05:19,086
WOULD THAT HAVE
BEEN ALL RIGHT?

878
01:05:19,127 --> 01:05:21,588
BEFORE THIS AFTERNOON, I COULD
HAVE ANSWERED YOU,

879
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:24,091
AND YOU WOULD
HAVE BELIEVED ME.

880
01:05:24,132 --> 01:05:26,593
BUT AFTER YOUR
FLAT ACCUSATION...

881
01:05:26,635 --> 01:05:28,595
ALL RIGHT!

882
01:05:28,637 --> 01:05:37,104
WHY DO YOU
HARP ON THAT?

883
01:05:37,146 --> 01:05:41,608
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE THOUGHT
IF YOU WERE IN MY PLACE?

884
01:05:41,650 --> 01:06:10,137
EXACTLY WHAT
YOU DID, MY FRIEND.

885
01:06:10,179 --> 01:06:13,640
THAT DOOR
LEADS TO A WALK.

886
01:06:13,682 --> 01:06:16,643
AT THE END OF THE WALK,
THERE'S A LANE.

887
01:06:16,685 --> 01:06:20,147
AT THE END OF THE LANE,
THERE'S A HIGHWAY.

888
01:06:20,189 --> 01:06:23,650
THIS DOOR'S WIDE ENOUGH
FOR TWO PEOPLE.

889
01:06:23,692 --> 01:06:28,655
THESE TWO?

890
01:06:28,697 --> 01:06:32,159
WE COULD END
ALL THIS RIGHT NOW.

891
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:35,162
YOU AND ME.

892
01:06:35,204 --> 01:06:38,665
THEN WHAT?

893
01:06:38,707 --> 01:06:41,668
THEN WE FIGURE
IT OUT TOGETHER.

894
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:46,673
YOU AND ME,
TOGETHER FOREVER?

895
01:06:46,715 --> 01:06:48,675
YOU REALLY BELIEVE
THAT, COLLIE?

896
01:06:48,717 --> 01:06:52,679
YOU REALLY BELIEVE
THERE COULD BE A YOU AND ME?

897
01:06:52,721 --> 01:06:55,682
I KNOW IT, FAY.

898
01:06:55,724 --> 01:07:00,187
COLLIE AND FAY.

899
01:07:00,229 --> 01:07:03,690
THROUGH THAT DOOR,
DOWN THE LANE...

900
01:07:03,732 --> 01:07:12,199
ONTO THE HIGHWAY.

901
01:07:12,241 --> 01:07:14,201
WE COULD DO IT, FAY.

902
01:07:14,243 --> 01:07:41,728
I CAN TAKE CARE
OF YOU REAL GOOD.

903
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:45,232
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.
THE CAR KEYS, COLLIE.

904
01:07:45,274 --> 01:07:46,733
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

905
01:07:46,775 --> 01:07:47,734
IT'S RATHER SIMPLE.

906
01:07:47,776 --> 01:07:49,736
I WANT THE KEYS
TO THE CAR.

907
01:07:49,778 --> 01:07:53,740
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

908
01:07:53,782 --> 01:08:34,281
WHY, I'M GOING OUT.

909
01:08:34,323 --> 01:08:36,283
MAYBE THIS WAS HER PLAN,

910
01:08:36,325 --> 01:08:39,786
A WAY OF CUTTING ME
OUT OF THE DEAL.

911
01:08:39,828 --> 01:08:41,788
SHE'D POINT ME
IN ONE DIRECTION

912
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:44,291
SO SHE COULD
MOVE IN ANOTHER.

913
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:45,792
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING,

914
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:47,794
SHE'D BEEN ABLE
TO GET ME SO MIXED UP

915
01:08:47,836 --> 01:08:50,297
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS DOING.

916
01:08:50,339 --> 01:08:52,799
SHE SENT ME AWAY
THAT FIRST TIME,

917
01:08:52,841 --> 01:08:54,301
BUT SHE KNEW
I'D COME BACK.

918
01:08:54,343 --> 01:08:56,803
I DIDN'T HAVE ANYPLACE
ELSE TO GO AND--

919
01:08:56,845 --> 01:08:57,805
MISTER?

920
01:08:57,846 --> 01:08:58,806
MISTER.

921
01:08:58,847 --> 01:08:59,807
I'M SICK.

922
01:08:59,848 --> 01:09:05,312
I THINK
I'M GOING TO--

923
01:09:05,354 --> 01:09:07,815
SORRY. I'LL CLEAN
IT UP, MISTER.

924
01:09:07,856 --> 01:09:09,316
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT.

925
01:09:09,358 --> 01:09:12,820
JUST CUT LOOSE
AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO.

926
01:09:12,861 --> 01:09:15,322
YOU'RE--YOU'RE
NOT MAD AT ME?

927
01:09:15,364 --> 01:09:18,826
WHY WOULD I BE MAD
AT A LITTLE BOY

928
01:09:18,867 --> 01:09:20,327
FOR BEING SICK?

929
01:09:20,369 --> 01:09:23,330
HONEST, YOU'RE
NOT MAD AT ME?

930
01:09:23,372 --> 01:09:25,332
NO, I'M NOT MAD.

931
01:09:25,374 --> 01:09:28,335
NO ONE ELSE
IS GOING TO BE MAD EITHER,

932
01:09:28,377 --> 01:09:35,843
BECAUSE IF
THEY DO GET MAD...

933
01:09:35,884 --> 01:09:41,348
THEY JUST BETTER
NOT. THAT'S ALL.

934
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:43,350
I LIKE YOU, MISTER.

935
01:09:43,392 --> 01:09:47,855
I LIKE YOU VERY MUCH.

936
01:09:47,896 --> 01:09:50,858
COLLIE, WAKE UP.

937
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:52,860
WAKE UP, COLLIE.

938
01:09:52,901 --> 01:09:53,861
AAH!

939
01:09:53,902 --> 01:09:55,362
PUT THE GUN DOWN!

940
01:09:55,404 --> 01:09:58,365
IT'S THE BOY, COLLIE.
HE'S...

941
01:09:58,407 --> 01:10:00,367
WHAT DID YOU
DO TO HIM?

942
01:10:00,409 --> 01:10:01,869
DO TO HIM?

943
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:03,370
HE'S SICK, THAT'S WHAT.

944
01:10:03,412 --> 01:10:24,391
HE LOOKS
LIKE HE'S DYING.

945
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:25,893
DAMN IT,
SAY SOMETHING.

946
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:26,894
DO SOMETHING.

947
01:10:26,935 --> 01:10:28,395
TURN ON THE RADIO.

948
01:10:28,437 --> 01:10:29,897
TURN ON
THE RADIO?

949
01:10:29,938 --> 01:10:31,398
THERE'S
PROBABLY SOMETHING

950
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,900
ABOUT HIS CONDITION
ON THERE.

951
01:10:32,941 --> 01:10:35,402
I THINK
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

952
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:37,905
THERE WERE SOME GUYS
IN THE HOSPITAL.

953
01:10:37,946 --> 01:10:45,412
TURN IT ON.

954
01:10:45,454 --> 01:10:48,916
HEY, CHARLIE BOY.

955
01:10:48,957 --> 01:10:59,927
YOU'LL BE OK.

956
01:10:59,968 --> 01:11:01,428
GOOD NEWS, KID.

957
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:03,931
THE FAMILY'S READY
TO PAY UP.

958
01:11:03,972 --> 01:11:06,934
THEY TOLD THE POLICE
TO STAY OUT.

959
01:11:06,975 --> 01:11:08,435
THEY JUST
WANT THE BOY.

960
01:11:08,477 --> 01:11:09,937
THEY AIN'T GOING
TO BE PICKY

961
01:11:09,978 --> 01:11:11,939
WHETHER HE'S
ALIVE OR NOT?

962
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:12,940
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

963
01:11:12,981 --> 01:11:14,441
HE'S GOT DIABETES.

964
01:11:14,483 --> 01:11:16,944
IT SAYS SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT IN HERE.

965
01:11:16,985 --> 01:11:19,947
WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT HE'D
HAVE A THING LIKE THAT?

966
01:11:19,988 --> 01:11:22,950
ALL THAT STARCH AND SUGAR
WASN'T GOOD FOR HIM.

967
01:11:22,991 --> 01:11:24,451
WONDER IT
DIDN'T KILL HIM.

968
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:25,953
MAYBE
IT WILL YET.

969
01:11:25,994 --> 01:11:27,955
MAYBE I'LL GET
HIM NEXT TIME.

970
01:11:27,996 --> 01:11:29,456
SAY WHAT
YOU MEAN.

971
01:11:29,498 --> 01:11:30,958
NOW, NOW.

972
01:11:30,999 --> 01:11:31,959
COME ON.

973
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,462
SO, KID, WHAT
ARE YOU DRINKING?

974
01:11:35,504 --> 01:11:36,964
HE NEEDS INSULIN.

975
01:11:37,005 --> 01:11:40,968
HE'LL DIE IF HE
DOESN'T GET IT.

976
01:11:41,009 --> 01:11:43,470
I KNOW
A COUPLE OF PLACES,

977
01:11:43,512 --> 01:11:47,474
BUT WITH IT BEING
IN ALL THE PAPERS AND EVERYTHING,

978
01:11:47,516 --> 01:11:51,979
IT'S LIKE ADVERTISING
THAT WE HAVE THE BOY.

979
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:52,980
I SEE YOUR POINT.

980
01:11:53,021 --> 01:11:55,816
BESIDES, IF YOU LOOK AT IT
FROM ONE ANGLE,

981
01:11:55,858 --> 01:11:58,819
IT'D BE LESS RISKY
FOR US IF HE DIED.

982
01:11:58,861 --> 01:12:01,321
WE GET THE MONEY
BEFOREHAND IN ANY CASE.

983
01:12:01,363 --> 01:12:02,823
WITHOUT HIM
AROUND AS EVIDENCE

984
01:12:02,865 --> 01:12:05,826
OR SOMEONE WHO CAN
IDENTIFY US, WELL...

985
01:12:05,868 --> 01:12:08,829
I WOULDN'T WANT THAT NICE
LITTLE BOY TO DIE,

986
01:12:08,871 --> 01:12:10,330
BUT IF WE
COULDN'T HELP IT,

987
01:12:10,372 --> 01:12:14,835
IT'D SURE TURN OUT
NICE FOR US.

988
01:12:14,877 --> 01:12:17,838
I WAS POINTING OUT
HOW YOU'D LOOK AT IT.

989
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,840
I DON'T SEE IT
THAT WAY.

990
01:12:19,882 --> 01:12:22,843
IF THINGS DON'T GO
AS SMOOTH AS WE HOPE,

991
01:12:22,885 --> 01:12:25,345
IT'D SURE BE BETTER
IF HE WAS ALIVE.

992
01:12:25,387 --> 01:12:27,848
ANY WAY YOU LOOK AT IT,
YOU'RE RIGHT,

993
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:29,349
BUT HOW'S THAT LEAVE US?

994
01:12:29,391 --> 01:12:31,351
GET SOME INSULIN
AT DOC GOLDMAN'S.

995
01:12:31,393 --> 01:12:33,854
YOU GET HIM OUT
ON A FAKE CALL.

996
01:12:33,896 --> 01:12:36,857
I SLIP IN,
GET THE STUFF.

997
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:42,362
SOUND GOOD
TO YOU, FAY?

998
01:12:42,404 --> 01:12:43,363
NO CAR.

999
01:12:43,405 --> 01:12:46,366
HE MUST HAVE
LEFT ALREADY.

1000
01:12:46,408 --> 01:12:47,868
NOW REMEMBER, KID.

1001
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:52,372
THE POOL HALL,
THE CORNER OF MAIN AND 5th.

1002
01:12:52,414 --> 01:12:53,874
WE'RE PALS,
RIGHT, KID?

1003
01:12:53,916 --> 01:12:56,376
THAT A BOY, KID.

1004
01:12:56,418 --> 01:14:22,963
YOU'RE DOING FINE.

1005
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:24,464
YOU CHEATING BASTARD.

1006
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:27,467
YOU THOUGHT I'D NEVER
CATCH UP WITH YOU?

1007
01:14:27,509 --> 01:14:28,969
WELL, GUESS WHAT?

1008
01:14:29,011 --> 01:14:31,972
I JUST NEED
A LITTLE MORE TIME.

1009
01:14:32,014 --> 01:14:38,979
I'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING,
YOU SORRY SON OF A BITCH.

1010
01:14:39,021 --> 01:14:41,482
YOU WERE GOING TO
GIVE IT TO ME?

1011
01:14:41,523 --> 01:14:43,484
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

1012
01:14:43,525 --> 01:14:45,486
WHERE'D HE
PICK YOU UP?

1013
01:14:45,527 --> 01:14:48,489
I CAME THROUGH THE DOOR,
AND THERE HE WAS.

1014
01:14:48,530 --> 01:14:50,491
HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
FOLLOWING YOU?

1015
01:14:50,532 --> 01:14:52,993
NO, NO. HE WAS JUST
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

1016
01:14:53,035 --> 01:15:27,027
BOY, I WOULD
HATE TO THINK...NO.

1017
01:15:27,069 --> 01:15:30,531
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING. YOU'RE CRAZY.

1018
01:15:30,572 --> 01:15:32,533
BUT I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

1019
01:15:32,574 --> 01:16:32,593
AND YOU'RE
THROUGH DOING IT.

1020
01:16:32,634 --> 01:16:38,599
OK, CHARLIE BOY.

1021
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:49,610
OK.

1022
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:52,112
YOU CAN GO IN
AND LOOK AT HIM

1023
01:16:52,154 --> 01:16:55,616
IF YOU WANT TO.

1024
01:16:55,657 --> 01:16:57,117
I CAN, HUH?

1025
01:16:57,159 --> 01:17:01,121
HE'S ALL RIGHT,
AND HE'LL STAY THAT WAY.

1026
01:17:01,163 --> 01:17:04,124
HOW LONG'S THIS
STUFF GOING TO LAST?

1027
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:07,127
LONG ENOUGH TO DECIDE
WHAT TO DO WITH HIM.

1028
01:17:07,169 --> 01:17:08,629
YOU WOULDN'T
BE THINKING

1029
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:16,637
ABOUT GIVING HIM
BACK FOR FREE, WOULD YOU?

1030
01:17:16,678 --> 01:17:19,139
I DON'T KNOW.

1031
01:17:19,181 --> 01:17:20,641
ARE YOU?

1032
01:17:20,682 --> 01:17:22,643
SKIP IT. I'LL BE
SCREWING MYSELF

1033
01:17:22,684 --> 01:17:24,645
IF I TALK TO YOU
MUCH LONGER.

1034
01:17:24,686 --> 01:17:27,648
I'M GETTING MYSELF
SOMETHING TO EAT NOW.

1035
01:17:27,689 --> 01:17:28,649
POOR COLLIE.

1036
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:32,653
THEY MAY HANG HIM,
BUT HE'LL FILL HIS STOMACH FIRST.

1037
01:17:32,694 --> 01:17:33,654
WITH FOOD.

1038
01:17:33,695 --> 01:17:35,656
HA. VERY GOOD.

1039
01:17:35,697 --> 01:17:39,159
THAT SORT OF THING
THROWS ME ABOUT YOU, COLLIE.

1040
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:41,161
YOU'RE SO SHARP
SOMETIMES THAT...

1041
01:17:41,203 --> 01:17:43,163
YEAH?

1042
01:17:43,205 --> 01:17:45,165
NEVER MIND.
THAT'S HOW IT IS.

1043
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:47,668
FAY, IF I ONLY KNEW
WHAT YOU WANTED...

1044
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:57,177
IF YOU TALKED STRAIGHT
TO ME, MAYBE I COULD...

1045
01:17:57,219 --> 01:18:04,184
THAT'S A LOT OF IFS
AND MAYBES, MY FRIEND.

1046
01:18:04,226 --> 01:18:07,688
SO MAYBE SOMEDAY...

1047
01:18:07,729 --> 01:22:45,841
IF...

1048
01:22:45,883 --> 01:23:06,862
COLLIE.

1049
01:23:06,904 --> 01:23:10,365
I JUST SPOKE
TO UNCLE BUD.

1050
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,867
YEAH?

1051
01:23:11,902 --> 01:23:15,370
HE THINKS WE SHOULD COME
OVER THERE RIGHT AWAY.

1052
01:23:15,412 --> 01:23:17,873
GO ON.

1053
01:23:17,915 --> 01:23:19,374
WHY DOES UNCLE BUD

1054
01:23:19,409 --> 01:23:24,379
THINK WE SHOULD
GO OVER RIGHT AWAY?

1055
01:23:24,421 --> 01:23:30,886
HONEY.

1056
01:23:30,921 --> 01:23:37,392
YOU'RE NOT AFRAID
TO TELL ME, ARE YOU, FAY?

1057
01:23:37,434 --> 01:23:44,900
AFTER ALL, TWO PEOPLE
AS CLOSE AS US...

1058
01:23:44,942 --> 01:23:47,402
SWEETHEARTS,
I GUESS YOU'D CALL US,

1059
01:23:47,444 --> 01:23:50,405
SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID
OF EACH OTHER.

1060
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:58,413
IT'S THE BOY, COLLIE.
HE RAN AWAY.

1061
01:23:58,455 --> 01:24:00,916
WELL, HE CAN'T BE
VERY FAR.

1062
01:24:00,951 --> 01:24:02,417
HE'S PROBABLY
HIDING SOMEWHERE.

1063
01:24:02,452 --> 01:24:04,419
I LOOKED BEFORE
I CALLED UNCLE BUD.

1064
01:24:04,461 --> 01:24:07,422
WELL,
WE'LL LOOK TOGETHER.

1065
01:24:07,464 --> 01:24:10,926
THAT WAY, IF ONE OF US
SEES SOMETHING,

1066
01:24:10,961 --> 01:24:13,428
HE CAN POINT IT OUT
TO THE OTHER.

1067
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:14,930
YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT WE'LL DO,

1068
01:24:14,972 --> 01:24:21,937
AND WE'LL DO IT
RIGHT NOW.

1069
01:24:21,972 --> 01:24:24,439
HE HAD TIME
TO MAKE HIS BED

1070
01:24:24,481 --> 01:24:26,441
BEFORE HE RAN
FOR HIS LIFE.

1071
01:24:26,483 --> 01:24:28,443
WE'VE GOT TO LEAVE.
HE'S HAD PLENTY--

1072
01:24:28,485 --> 01:24:30,946
I TOLD YOU THE BOY
HAD TO STAY ALIVE,

1073
01:24:30,981 --> 01:24:32,447
AND I TOLD YOU WHY.

1074
01:24:32,482 --> 01:24:33,949
NOW, WHERE IS HE?

1075
01:24:33,991 --> 01:24:35,951
WHAT DID YOU
DO WITH HIM?

1076
01:24:35,993 --> 01:24:41,957
YOU REALLY THINK I'D
DO SOMETHING TO HIM?

1077
01:24:41,992 --> 01:24:42,958
OH, COLLIE.

1078
01:24:42,993 --> 01:24:44,960
LET'S BE NICE, HUH?

1079
01:24:45,002 --> 01:24:48,463
LET'S--LET'S LIE
DOWN A WHILE, HUH?

1080
01:24:48,505 --> 01:24:52,468
LET'S--LET'S GET
ALL NICE AND CALM.

1081
01:24:52,503 --> 01:24:55,471
SHALL WE?

1082
01:24:55,512 --> 01:24:58,974
TRY SOMETHING LIKE THAT AGAIN
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

1083
01:24:59,016 --> 01:25:01,477
I'M WARNING YOU
I'LL KILL YOU FOR THAT.

1084
01:25:01,512 --> 01:25:55,030
MAYBE. NOW YOU'RE DOING
SOMETHING ELSE FAST AND NO MAYBE.

1085
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:58,033
WELL, I GUESS
I SCREWED UP, HUH?

1086
01:25:58,075 --> 01:26:00,035
DIDN'T HIT HIM
HARD ENOUGH.

1087
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:01,036
WHAT HAPPENED?

1088
01:26:01,071 --> 01:26:05,541
YOU JUST LEAVE HIM OUT THERE
HOPING HE'D BE FOUND?

1089
01:26:05,582 --> 01:26:07,543
DID I? YOU TELL ME.

1090
01:26:07,584 --> 01:26:13,048
GUESS YOU
PROBABLY DID.

1091
01:26:13,083 --> 01:26:14,550
YOU DO, HUH?

1092
01:26:14,591 --> 01:26:17,052
YOU'D ACTUALLY
GIVE ME A BREAK?

1093
01:26:17,094 --> 01:26:18,554
WELL, SHOVE IT,
BRIGHT BOY.

1094
01:26:18,595 --> 01:26:21,056
I HIT HIM
WITH A BIG ROCK

1095
01:26:21,091 --> 01:26:22,558
AND LEFT HIM TO DIE.

1096
01:26:22,593 --> 01:26:27,563
IF I'D HAD TIME,
I'D HAVE BEAT HIS BRAINS OUT.

1097
01:26:27,604 --> 01:26:28,564
BE QUIET.

1098
01:26:28,605 --> 01:26:30,566
YOU'RE
UPSETTING THE BOY.

1099
01:26:30,601 --> 01:26:32,067
WHY THE HELL
SHOULD I?

1100
01:26:32,102 --> 01:26:36,572
DIDN'T I TRY TO
KILL HIM, YOU SON OF A BITCH?

1101
01:26:36,613 --> 01:26:38,073
I TRIED TO KILL HIM!

1102
01:26:38,115 --> 01:26:39,575
I MEANT TO! I DID!

1103
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:43,579
I DID! I--

1104
01:26:43,614 --> 01:26:48,584
MRS. ANDERSON...
ISN'T IT?

1105
01:26:48,625 --> 01:26:54,590
I'M DR. GOLDMAN.

1106
01:26:54,631 --> 01:26:58,594
WELL, HELLO, DOCTOR.

1107
01:26:58,635 --> 01:27:01,096
I JUST DROPPED IN
FOR A MOMENT.

1108
01:27:01,131 --> 01:27:02,598
I'M DUE
AT THE OFFICE,

1109
01:27:02,633 --> 01:27:06,101
BUT I HAPPENED TO BE
OUT THIS WAY, AND...

1110
01:27:06,143 --> 01:27:07,603
YOUR SON?

1111
01:27:07,644 --> 01:27:11,106
COLLIE DIDN'T TELL ME YOU
HAD ANY CHILDREN.

1112
01:27:11,141 --> 01:27:14,109
IT'S HER NEPHEW.
HE'S VISITING FOR A FEW DAYS.

1113
01:27:14,151 --> 01:27:15,611
I SEE.

1114
01:27:15,652 --> 01:27:17,613
FINE-LOOKING BOY.

1115
01:27:17,654 --> 01:27:27,122
A LITTLE UNDER
THE WEATHER, IS HE?

1116
01:27:27,164 --> 01:27:29,625
NOT FEELING TOO WELL,
HUH, SONNY?

1117
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:31,126
NEVER MIND.

1118
01:27:31,161 --> 01:27:35,631
YOU DON'T
NEED TO TALK.

1119
01:27:35,672 --> 01:27:41,136
LET'S SEE IF I DON'T
HAVE SOMETHING TO, UM...

1120
01:27:41,171 --> 01:27:44,640
NO, I GUESS NOT.

1121
01:27:44,681 --> 01:27:48,143
I REMEMBER I WAS LOOKING
FOR SOME THIS MORNING

1122
01:27:48,185 --> 01:27:50,646
BEFORE I LEFT THE OFFICE.

1123
01:27:50,681 --> 01:27:55,150
HE COULD DO
WITH A B-12 SHOT.

1124
01:27:55,192 --> 01:27:58,153
YOU MIGHT MENTION THAT
TO HIS MOTHER.

1125
01:27:58,195 --> 01:28:00,155
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

1126
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:01,657
THANKS, DOCTOR.

1127
01:28:01,692 --> 01:28:03,158
DON'T MENTION IT.

1128
01:28:03,193 --> 01:28:21,677
JUST SORRY I COULDN'T DO
SOMETHING FOR HIM.

1129
01:28:21,712 --> 01:28:26,181
HOW DID IT HAPPEN,
COLLIE?

1130
01:28:26,223 --> 01:28:33,689
HOW COULD YOU
HAVE DONE IT?

1131
01:28:33,730 --> 01:28:35,691
GET OUT OF THE WAY.

1132
01:28:35,732 --> 01:28:37,693
DO YOU HEAR ME, COLLIE?

1133
01:28:37,734 --> 01:28:44,700
STAND OUT OF THE WAY
AT ONCE.

1134
01:28:44,741 --> 01:28:47,202
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

1135
01:28:47,244 --> 01:28:49,705
SOMEONE DUPED YOU
INTO THIS.

1136
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:54,209
THEY'RE USING YOU
FOR THEIR OWN CRIMINAL PURPOSES.

1137
01:28:54,251 --> 01:28:58,714
IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY DIFFERENCE, DOC.

1138
01:28:58,755 --> 01:29:00,716
YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

1139
01:29:00,751 --> 01:29:05,220
WE'RE LEAVING,
AND YOU'RE GOING TO STAY.

1140
01:29:05,262 --> 01:29:08,223
CAN'T I APPEAL TO YOU,
MRS. ANDERSON?

1141
01:29:08,265 --> 01:29:10,726
CAN'T YOU MAKE HIM
UNDERSTAND?

1142
01:29:10,761 --> 01:29:12,227
FAY, WE'RE LEAVING.

1143
01:29:12,262 --> 01:29:14,730
GET TOGETHER ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO TAKE

1144
01:29:14,771 --> 01:29:28,744
AND GO OUT TO THE CAR.

1145
01:29:28,785 --> 01:29:30,245
WELL...

1146
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:57,773
I SUPPOSE IF THAT'S
THE WAY IT HAS TO BE.

1147
01:29:57,815 --> 01:29:59,274
THERE'S SOMETHING
INSIDE EVERY MAN

1148
01:29:59,309 --> 01:30:00,776
THAT KEEPS HIM GOING

1149
01:30:00,811 --> 01:30:03,278
LONG AFTER HE HAS
ANY REASON TO.

1150
01:30:03,313 --> 01:30:05,280
FOR YEARS I KEPT GOING

1151
01:30:05,322 --> 01:30:06,782
WHEN GOING
DIDN'T MAKE SENSE,

1152
01:30:06,824 --> 01:30:09,785
AND NOW I JUST
HAD TO KEEP GOING.

1153
01:30:09,820 --> 01:31:21,815
I HAD TO HAVE
THE END COME.

1154
01:31:21,857 --> 01:31:23,317
SO, KID.

1155
01:31:23,358 --> 01:31:25,819
YOU SEE ANYTHING
I'VE OVERLOOKED?

1156
01:31:25,861 --> 01:31:29,323
IF YOU THINK OF ANYTHING,
JUST LET ME KNOW.

1157
01:31:29,364 --> 01:31:32,326
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO NEED ALL THIS.

1158
01:31:32,367 --> 01:31:35,329
I WANT YOU AND FAY
TO BE COMFORTABLE.

1159
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:39,333
YOU MAY HAVE TO HOLE UP
HERE FOR QUITE A WHILE.

1160
01:31:39,374 --> 01:31:40,834
THERE'S PLENTY.

1161
01:31:40,876 --> 01:31:42,336
WHAT I MEAN IS,

1162
01:31:42,377 --> 01:31:44,838
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN YOU'LL NEED SOMETHING,

1163
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,341
AND I WON'T BE
AROUND TO GET IT.

1164
01:31:47,382 --> 01:31:49,843
WELL, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

1165
01:31:49,885 --> 01:31:53,847
I BETTER GET INTO TOWN
AND CHECK ON THE COPS,

1166
01:31:53,889 --> 01:31:56,850
MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT
COOKING ANYTHING UP.

1167
01:31:56,892 --> 01:31:59,853
STAY RIGHT
WHERE YOU ARE.

1168
01:31:59,895 --> 01:32:00,854
WE'RE GOING WITH YOU.

1169
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:02,356
GOING WITH ME?

1170
01:32:02,397 --> 01:32:03,357
WHAT FOR?

1171
01:32:03,398 --> 01:32:05,859
FOR THE SAME REASON
YOU'RE GOING,

1172
01:32:05,901 --> 01:32:08,862
TO GET THE MONEY.

1173
01:32:08,904 --> 01:32:13,867
UH, IT AIN'T TIME, KID.

1174
01:32:13,909 --> 01:32:15,369
YOU KNOW IT AIN'T.

1175
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:16,870
HOW DO I KNOW THAT?

1176
01:32:16,912 --> 01:32:19,373
YOU KNOW THAT
BECAUSE WE MADE A PLAN.

1177
01:32:19,414 --> 01:32:20,374
FORGET IT.

1178
01:32:20,415 --> 01:32:21,875
IT DOESN'T
CHANGE ANYTHING.

1179
01:32:21,917 --> 01:32:24,378
SEE, UH,
FAY DOESN'T TRUST ME,

1180
01:32:24,419 --> 01:32:26,380
AND I DON'T TRUST HER.

1181
01:32:26,421 --> 01:32:27,881
WE BOTH
DON'T TRUST YOU,

1182
01:32:27,923 --> 01:32:30,384
BUT I CAN
FIX THAT PART--YOU.

1183
01:32:30,425 --> 01:32:34,388
WE'LL PARK NEAR THE TERMINAL
WHERE I CAN SEE YOU.

1184
01:32:34,429 --> 01:32:35,889
YOU GOT 15 MINUTES.

1185
01:32:35,931 --> 01:32:38,392
YOU'RE NOT BACK,
I'LL TIP OFF THE COPS.

1186
01:32:38,433 --> 01:32:39,893
KID, I--

1187
01:32:39,935 --> 01:32:49,903
YES?

1188
01:32:49,945 --> 01:32:52,406
I'M GOING TO LEVEL
WITH YOU.

1189
01:32:52,447 --> 01:32:56,410
I'M NOT QUITE THE
GUY YOU THINK I AM.

1190
01:32:56,451 --> 01:32:57,911
SURE ABOUT THAT?

1191
01:32:57,953 --> 01:33:00,414
YEAH.

1192
01:33:00,455 --> 01:33:05,419
I'VE GOT NO PIPELINES
INTO THE DEPARTMENT.

1193
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:06,920
THE GUYS I KNOW,

1194
01:33:06,962 --> 01:33:09,923
THEY WON'T EVEN
SPEAK TO ME ANYMORE.

1195
01:33:09,965 --> 01:33:12,926
THEY SEE ME COMING,
AND, UH...

1196
01:33:12,968 --> 01:33:15,429
THEY TURN
THE OTHER WAY.

1197
01:33:15,471 --> 01:33:17,931
YOU'RE NOT SURE
WHOEVER GETS THE MONEY

1198
01:33:17,973 --> 01:33:19,433
ISN'T WALKING
INTO A TRAP.

1199
01:33:19,475 --> 01:33:20,434
RIGHT.

1200
01:33:20,476 --> 01:33:22,436
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND OUT
AWFULLY FAST.

1201
01:33:22,478 --> 01:33:24,438
KID.

1202
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,940
DON'T MAKE ME
DO THIS, KID.

1203
01:33:26,982 --> 01:33:29,943
PLEASE DON'T
MAKE ME DO THIS.

1204
01:33:29,985 --> 01:33:35,449
IF ONE OF THOSE GUYS
SHOULD CALL BERT,

1205
01:33:35,491 --> 01:33:38,702
HE COULD BE THERE
IN FIVE MINUTES.

1206
01:33:38,744 --> 01:33:41,955
WE SAT THERE FOR
ANOTHER HALF-HOUR OR SO,

1207
01:33:41,997 --> 01:33:44,458
AND HE WAS TALKING
EVERY MINUTE OF IT.

1208
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:47,961
THE WORDS POURED
OUT OF HIS MOUTH,

1209
01:33:48,003 --> 01:33:49,463
AND THEY DIDN'T
MEAN A THING TO ME.

1210
01:33:49,505 --> 01:33:51,965
THEY WERE JUST
A LOT OF NOISES

1211
01:33:52,007 --> 01:33:53,967
COMING FROM
A SICKISH-LOOKING FACE.

1212
01:33:54,009 --> 01:33:57,471
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAID
HAD NEVER MEANT A THING TO HIM.

1213
01:33:57,513 --> 01:33:58,972
NOW IT WAS HIS TURN.

1214
01:33:59,014 --> 01:34:00,474
NOW HE WAS MEANINGLESS,

1215
01:34:00,516 --> 01:34:03,477
AND WHAT HE SAID
WAS MEANINGLESS.

1216
01:34:03,519 --> 01:34:07,439
I'M BEGGING YOU.

1217
01:34:07,474 --> 01:34:13,946
I'VE GOT A BAD
FEELING ABOUT THIS.

1218
01:34:13,981 --> 01:34:19,451
IF THE COPS
DON'T GET ME...

1219
01:34:19,493 --> 01:34:20,953
WELL...

1220
01:34:20,994 --> 01:34:21,954
SHUT UP!

1221
01:34:21,995 --> 01:34:23,956
GET UP AND START MOVING.

1222
01:34:23,991 --> 01:36:00,511
I AM SO SICK
OF LOOKING AT YOU.

1223
01:36:00,546 --> 01:36:03,472
HOW'S OUR BOY DOING?

1224
01:36:03,514 --> 01:36:14,483
OUR BOY IS SICK.

1225
01:36:14,525 --> 01:36:15,984
THE WHITE ZONE

1226
01:36:16,026 --> 01:36:26,495
IS FOR PASSENGER LOADING
AND UNLOADING ONLY.

1227
01:36:26,537 --> 01:36:30,999
COLLIE, WHAT ARE
THEY DOING, HUH?

1228
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:33,001
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

1229
01:36:33,043 --> 01:36:35,003
WELL, DO SOMETHING.

1230
01:36:35,045 --> 01:36:37,005
LET'S GO.
COME ON. LET'S--

1231
01:36:37,047 --> 01:36:38,549
COLLIE, I'M SCARED.

1232
01:36:38,584 --> 01:36:41,510
I'M SO SCARED.

1233
01:36:41,552 --> 01:36:43,512
HEY.

1234
01:36:43,554 --> 01:36:46,014
UH, SOMETHING
THE MATTER, OFFICER?

1235
01:36:46,056 --> 01:36:48,559
I'M SITTING HERE
WITH MY WIFE, AND, UH--

1236
01:36:48,594 --> 01:36:50,060
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

1237
01:36:50,095 --> 01:36:51,520
MY FRIEND
JACK BILLINGSLEY.

1238
01:36:51,562 --> 01:36:54,022
HE'S COMING IN
FROM THE EAST.

1239
01:36:54,064 --> 01:36:56,525
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
THIS YOUR CAR?

1240
01:36:56,567 --> 01:36:59,570
LET ME SEE YOUR
REGISTRATION.

1241
01:36:59,605 --> 01:37:03,532
YOU'VE GOT THE REGISTRATION,
HAVEN'T YOU, HONEY?

1242
01:37:03,574 --> 01:37:05,033
HAVEN'T I SEEN
YOU BEFORE?

1243
01:37:05,075 --> 01:37:08,078
WHAT DID YOU SAY
YOUR NAME WAS?

1244
01:37:08,113 --> 01:37:09,079
COLLINS.

1245
01:37:09,114 --> 01:37:12,040
I'M WAITING FOR MY
FRIEND JACK BILLINGSLEY.

1246
01:37:12,082 --> 01:37:13,542
I'VE SEEN YOU.

1247
01:37:13,584 --> 01:37:15,544
YOU EVER BEEN
IN TROUBLE?

1248
01:37:15,586 --> 01:37:18,046
HOW YOU DOING ON
THAT REGISTRATION, MA'AM?

1249
01:37:18,088 --> 01:37:21,550
I THINK YOU HAVE ME MIXED UP
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

1250
01:37:21,592 --> 01:37:24,553
I'M, UH, RETIRED NOW,
BUT I USED TO--

1251
01:37:24,595 --> 01:37:26,555
I AIN'T GOT YOU
MIXED UP.

1252
01:37:26,597 --> 01:37:28,098
I SEEN YOU.

1253
01:37:28,133 --> 01:37:34,062
LET ME SEE YOUR
DRIVER'S LICENSE.

1254
01:37:34,104 --> 01:37:35,564
HOLD IT.

1255
01:37:35,606 --> 01:37:37,065
COLLINS.

1256
01:37:37,107 --> 01:37:38,609
KID COLLINS.

1257
01:37:38,644 --> 01:37:42,571
WHY, SURE. I WON
100 BUCKS ON YOU.

1258
01:37:42,613 --> 01:37:43,572
YOU'RE RETIRED
NOW, KID?

1259
01:37:43,614 --> 01:37:47,618
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO GIVE YOU A HARD TIME,

1260
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:49,119
BUT WITH
THIS GOING ON.

1261
01:37:49,154 --> 01:37:51,580
WHATISGOING ON HERE,
SOME TROUBLE?

1262
01:37:51,622 --> 01:37:55,083
YOU SAID IT. YOU SHOULD COME GET
YOUR FRIEND LATER.

1263
01:37:55,125 --> 01:37:56,585
LET'S SEE.

1264
01:37:56,627 --> 01:37:58,086
YOU BACK IT ON UP.

1265
01:37:58,128 --> 01:38:00,130
I'LL WAVE
YOU THROUGH.

1266
01:38:00,165 --> 01:38:12,100
OK.

1267
01:38:12,142 --> 01:38:13,101
AAH!

1268
01:38:13,143 --> 01:38:14,603
HE'S GOT A GUN!

1269
01:38:14,645 --> 01:38:27,115
FREEZE!
DROP YOUR WEAPON!

1270
01:38:27,157 --> 01:38:29,159
YOU'D STILL BE
BETTER OFF

1271
01:38:29,194 --> 01:38:31,620
COMING BACK LATER
FOR YOUR FRIEND.

1272
01:38:31,662 --> 01:38:34,623
THIS PLACE IS GOING TO BE
A LITTLE CRAZY.

1273
01:38:34,665 --> 01:38:36,625
PULL IT ON OUT
THAT WAY.

1274
01:38:36,667 --> 01:38:39,670
I'LL SIGNAL FOR THE GUYS
TO LET YOU THROUGH.

1275
01:38:39,705 --> 01:39:27,718
THANK YOU.

1276
01:39:27,753 --> 01:39:29,219
[RADIO]
SO FAR THE KIDNAPPING

1277
01:39:29,254 --> 01:39:30,721
HAS STYMIED THE POLICE.

1278
01:39:30,756 --> 01:39:33,182
HOWEVER, THE AUTHORITIES
ARE OPTIMISTIC

1279
01:39:33,223 --> 01:39:34,516
BECAUSE MR. ROGERS,

1280
01:39:34,551 --> 01:39:36,018
THE VANDERVENTER FAMILY
CHAUFFEUR,

1281
01:39:36,053 --> 01:39:39,021
WAS ABLE TO TALK
WITH POLICE THIS AFTERNOON.

1282
01:39:39,062 --> 01:39:41,023
WHILE STILL
IN INTENSIVE CARE,

1283
01:39:41,064 --> 01:39:42,524
HE WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE

1284
01:39:42,559 --> 01:39:45,027
THE FIRST DETAILED
DESCRIPTION OF THE SUSPECT.

1285
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:46,528
WAIT. THIS JUST IN.

1286
01:39:46,563 --> 01:39:49,531
THE POLICE ARE REPORTING
A SIGHTING OF THE SUSPECT

1287
01:39:49,573 --> 01:39:52,534
AS HE FLED THE SCENE
OF A SHOOTOUT

1288
01:39:52,569 --> 01:39:53,535
AT THE AIRPORT
MOMENTS AGO.

1289
01:39:53,570 --> 01:39:56,038
HE'S IDENTIFIED AS
KEVIN "KID" COLLINS,

1290
01:39:56,073 --> 01:39:59,541
AN EX-BOXER WHO RECENTLY
MOVED TO THE AREA.

1291
01:39:59,583 --> 01:40:02,044
HE WAS LAST SEEN TRAVELING
WITH A WOMAN

1292
01:40:02,085 --> 01:40:04,046
POLICE BELIEVE MAY HAVE
BEEN ABDUCTED

1293
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:05,547
BY THE KIDNAPPERS.

1294
01:40:05,582 --> 01:40:08,050
IN WHAT MAY BE
A RELATED DEVELOPMENT,

1295
01:40:08,091 --> 01:40:10,052
THE BODY
OF LONGTIME RESIDENT

1296
01:40:10,093 --> 01:40:12,554
DR. JAKE GOLDMAN
WAS FOUND THIS MORNING

1297
01:40:12,589 --> 01:40:15,057
BOUND AND GAGGED
IN AN ISOLATED DESERT HOME.

1298
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:17,559
THE 50-YEAR-OLD BACHELOR
APPARENTLY DIED

1299
01:40:17,594 --> 01:40:20,562
FROM A SINGLE BLOW
TO THE HEART.

1300
01:40:20,604 --> 01:40:34,576
THE VALLEY PLANNING
COMMISSION IS MEETING...

1301
01:40:34,611 --> 01:40:37,079
WHEN A MAN STOPS CARING
WHAT HAPPENS,

1302
01:40:37,114 --> 01:40:40,582
ALL THE STRAIN
IS LIFTED FROM HIM.

1303
01:40:40,624 --> 01:40:42,584
SUSPICION AND WORRY
AND FEAR,

1304
01:40:42,619 --> 01:40:47,089
ALL THE THINGS THAT TWIST
HIS THINKING OUT OF FOCUS,

1305
01:40:47,124 --> 01:40:48,090
ARE BRUSHED ASIDE,

1306
01:40:48,132 --> 01:40:50,092
AND HE CAN SEE PEOPLE

1307
01:40:50,134 --> 01:40:53,095
EXACTLY AS THEY ARE
AT LAST...

1308
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:55,597
AS I SAW FAY THEN--

1309
01:40:55,632 --> 01:40:57,099
WEAK AND FRIGHTENED,

1310
01:40:57,134 --> 01:40:59,601
BUT BASICALLY AS GOOD
AS A PERSON COULD BE

1311
01:40:59,643 --> 01:41:03,605
AND HATING HERSELF
FOR NOT BEING BETTER.

1312
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:06,108
SUDDENLY THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERED

1313
01:41:06,143 --> 01:41:07,609
WAS THAT SHE LIVE.

1314
01:41:07,644 --> 01:41:10,112
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
MY HAVING LIVED

1315
01:41:10,154 --> 01:41:11,613
COULD MAKE ANY SENSE.

1316
01:41:11,655 --> 01:41:15,117
IT WAS WHY I HAD BEEN
MADE LIKE I WAS--

1317
01:41:15,152 --> 01:41:16,618
TO DO SOMETHING FOR HER

1318
01:41:16,653 --> 01:41:18,620
SHE COULDN'T DO
FOR HERSELF,

1319
01:41:18,655 --> 01:41:22,124
THEN TO PROTECT HER
SO THAT SHE COULD GO ON--

1320
01:41:22,166 --> 01:41:25,127
SO THAT SHE WOULD HAVE
THE REASON FOR LIVING

1321
01:41:25,162 --> 01:41:58,118
THAT I'D NEVER HAD.

1322
01:41:58,153 --> 01:42:00,621
FUNNY HOW SOMETIMES
THINGS THAT AREN'T TRUE

1323
01:42:00,656 --> 01:42:04,583
ARE MORE TRUE
THAN THE TRUTH...

1324
01:42:04,625 --> 01:42:07,085
BECAUSE IN A WAY
FAY HAD BEEN ABDUCTED.

1325
01:42:07,127 --> 01:42:09,129
NONE OF THIS
WOULD'VE HAPPENED

1326
01:42:09,164 --> 01:42:11,089
IF I HADN'T COME ALONG.

1327
01:42:11,131 --> 01:42:12,591
AS SHE SAID,

1328
01:42:12,633 --> 01:42:15,093
THIS SCHEME HAD BEEN
COOKING A LONG TIME.

1329
01:42:15,135 --> 01:42:18,639
NOW WITHOUT ME, IT WOULD
JUST BOIL AWAY TO NOTHING.

1330
01:42:18,674 --> 01:42:21,099
SHE HAD SENT ME AWAY ONCE,

1331
01:42:21,141 --> 01:42:23,101
BUT I CAME BACK.

1332
01:42:23,143 --> 01:42:24,603
I HAD TO.

1333
01:42:24,645 --> 01:42:31,610
AND NOW FAY WAS THE ONE
PAYING THE PRICE.

1334
01:42:31,652 --> 01:42:34,613
I NEEDED A WAY.

1335
01:42:34,655 --> 01:42:37,616
ONE LAST PLAN TO MAKE
THE WHOLE THING RIGHT

1336
01:42:37,658 --> 01:43:22,661
AND LEAVE HER
IN THE CLEAR.

1337
01:43:22,703 --> 01:43:25,664
WE KNOW WHAT TO DO.
LET'S GET IT OVER WITH.

1338
01:43:25,706 --> 01:43:26,665
MIGHT AS WELL.

1339
01:43:26,707 --> 01:43:31,170
ONE LAST THING, COLLIE.

1340
01:43:31,211 --> 01:43:33,672
WE'VE DONE SOME PRETTY
INEXCUSABLE THINGS.

1341
01:43:33,714 --> 01:43:35,674
I KNOW YOU WEREN'T
RESPONSIBLE.

1342
01:43:35,716 --> 01:43:39,720
YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD TO
PROTECT THE BOY FROM ME.

1343
01:43:39,755 --> 01:43:41,680
WHATEVER I SAID,
I'M SORRY.

1344
01:43:41,722 --> 01:43:43,682
FORGET IT.
IT WAS MY FAULT.

1345
01:43:43,724 --> 01:43:46,685
I THOUGHT IT WAS SMART
TO KEEP THE BOY ALIVE.

1346
01:43:46,727 --> 01:43:50,731
NOW I SEE IT WAS
ABOUT THE DUMBEST THING I EVER DID.

1347
01:43:50,766 --> 01:43:53,192
WELL...

1348
01:43:53,233 --> 01:43:57,696
REGARDLESS WHO WAS
AT FAULT, I...

1349
01:43:57,738 --> 01:43:59,740
WHAT?

1350
01:43:59,775 --> 01:44:02,701
WHY, COLLIE,
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

1351
01:44:02,743 --> 01:44:04,203
DON'T YOU GET IT?

1352
01:44:04,244 --> 01:44:05,704
YOU CALL ME STUPID,

1353
01:44:05,746 --> 01:44:07,706
AND YOU DON'T SEE
WHAT I MEAN?

1354
01:44:07,748 --> 01:44:09,249
NO, I DON'T SEE.

1355
01:44:09,284 --> 01:44:12,211
YOU'VE GOT TO.

1356
01:44:12,252 --> 01:44:14,213
UNCLE BUD
COULD BE BLAMED

1357
01:44:14,254 --> 01:44:16,215
FOR PRACTICALLY
EVERYTHING I'VE DONE,

1358
01:44:16,256 --> 01:44:17,216
COULDN'T HE?

1359
01:44:17,257 --> 01:44:18,258
AND YOU--

1360
01:44:18,293 --> 01:44:20,260
WHAT ARE YOU
GETTING AT?

1361
01:44:20,295 --> 01:44:22,221
YOU'VE GOT IT
JUST ABOUT PERFECT.

1362
01:44:22,262 --> 01:44:25,724
IT LOOKS ABOUT 100%
BETTER FOR YOU THAN FOR ME.

1363
01:44:25,766 --> 01:44:27,726
YOU'RE A WOMAN
LIVING ALONE.

1364
01:44:27,768 --> 01:44:29,269
UNCLE BUD
THREATENED YOU.

1365
01:44:29,304 --> 01:44:31,730
YOU WERE SCARED
TO DEATH OF ME,

1366
01:44:31,772 --> 01:44:33,732
SO YOU WENT ALONG
WITH THIS.

1367
01:44:33,774 --> 01:44:36,235
I ASKED YOU WHAT
YOU'RE GETTING AT.

1368
01:44:36,276 --> 01:44:39,279
YOU REALLY DON'T
GET IT, DO YOU?

1369
01:44:39,314 --> 01:44:42,241
THEN I GUESS
YOU WOULDN'T AT THAT.

1370
01:44:42,282 --> 01:44:45,244
IT WON'T HURT YOU
IF THE BOY TALKS,

1371
01:44:45,285 --> 01:44:48,247
BUT IT WILL
HURT ME PLENTY.

1372
01:44:48,288 --> 01:44:50,290
SO...

1373
01:44:50,325 --> 01:44:52,751
THERE'S YOUR ANSWER.

1374
01:44:52,793 --> 01:44:54,753
ALL SPELLED OUT FOR YOU.

1375
01:44:54,795 --> 01:45:06,765
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO DO ANY TALKING.

1376
01:45:06,807 --> 01:45:08,267
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

1377
01:45:08,308 --> 01:45:09,810
YOU CAN'T MEAN IT.

1378
01:45:09,845 --> 01:45:13,772
YOU'VE HAD EVEN MORE
THAN A NORMAL PERSON COULD TAKE,

1379
01:45:13,814 --> 01:45:15,774
AND YOU'RE EXCITED
AND FRIGHTENED.

1380
01:45:15,816 --> 01:45:18,318
YOU DON'T MEAN IT,
DO YOU, DARLING?

1381
01:45:18,353 --> 01:45:19,820
I KNOW MY COLLIE.

1382
01:45:19,855 --> 01:45:21,280
OOH.

1383
01:45:21,321 --> 01:45:24,283
I REALLY HAD YOU FOOLED,
DIDN'T I?

1384
01:45:24,324 --> 01:45:26,285
WELL, I GUESS I SHOULD.

1385
01:45:26,326 --> 01:45:27,786
ALL THIS PRACTICE.

1386
01:45:27,828 --> 01:45:29,830
I WAS UP FOR MURDER.

1387
01:45:29,865 --> 01:45:32,791
IT WAS THE ONLY THING
I COULD THINK OF,

1388
01:45:32,833 --> 01:45:34,793
SO I WENT INTO THE ACT,

1389
01:45:34,835 --> 01:45:36,295
AND IT GOT ME OFF.

1390
01:45:36,336 --> 01:45:38,839
IT LOOKED LIKE
SUCH A GOOD DEAL,

1391
01:45:38,874 --> 01:45:40,799
I STARTED WORKING IT
FULL-TIME.

1392
01:45:40,841 --> 01:45:42,301
WHAT ACT?

1393
01:45:42,342 --> 01:45:44,803
THE CRAZY STUFF, FAY.

1394
01:45:44,845 --> 01:45:47,306
HELL, IT'S BETTER
THAN A PENSION.

1395
01:45:47,347 --> 01:45:50,809
I CAN JUST ROAM AROUND,
DOING WHATEVER I WANT,

1396
01:45:50,851 --> 01:45:52,811
ACTING STUPID.

1397
01:45:52,853 --> 01:45:54,813
WHEN I GET
A LITTLE TIRED,

1398
01:45:54,855 --> 01:45:58,358
I JUST CHECK INTO AN
INSTITUTION FOR A WHILE.

1399
01:45:58,393 --> 01:45:59,359
HELL, I TELL YOU,

1400
01:45:59,394 --> 01:46:02,321
SOMETIMES THEY GIVE YOU
A PRIVATE ROOM,

1401
01:46:02,362 --> 01:46:04,323
ANYTHING YOU WANT
TO EAT.

1402
01:46:04,364 --> 01:46:06,825
I DON'T KNOW WHY
PEOPLE DON'T GET WISE.

1403
01:46:06,867 --> 01:46:09,369
YOU DO ALL SORTS
OF THINGS

1404
01:46:09,404 --> 01:46:10,829
TO GIVE YOURSELF AWAY,

1405
01:46:10,871 --> 01:46:11,830
BUT SOMEHOW,

1406
01:46:11,872 --> 01:46:13,832
THEY NEVER CATCH ON.

1407
01:46:13,874 --> 01:46:17,336
THEY KEEP FALLING
FOR THE SAME ACT

1408
01:46:17,377 --> 01:46:19,880
AND FEELING SORRY
FOR YOU.

1409
01:46:19,915 --> 01:46:20,839
GOD.

1410
01:46:20,881 --> 01:46:25,844
LET'S JUST GET THIS
OVER WITH.

1411
01:46:25,886 --> 01:46:27,346
I WON'T KILL YOU.

1412
01:46:27,387 --> 01:46:28,847
I'LL JUST MESS YOU UP,

1413
01:46:28,889 --> 01:46:31,350
MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
THERE WAS A STRUGGLE.

1414
01:46:31,391 --> 01:46:33,852
I TRIED TO KEEP YOU
FROM KILLING THE BOY.

1415
01:46:33,894 --> 01:46:35,854
THE GUN ACCIDENTALLY
WENT OFF.

1416
01:46:35,896 --> 01:46:38,899
DO ANYTHING TO ME,
BUT DON'T KILL HIM.

1417
01:46:38,934 --> 01:46:40,400
THERE'S AN IDEA.

1418
01:46:40,435 --> 01:46:48,867
INSTEAD OF BUMPING OFF THE BRAT
AND LEAVING HIM ALONE.

1419
01:46:48,909 --> 01:46:50,410
I LIKE YOU, CHARLIE.

1420
01:46:50,445 --> 01:46:52,371
I LIKE YOU VERY MUCH.

1421
01:46:52,412 --> 01:47:09,429
[GUNSHOT]

1422
01:47:09,464 --> 01:47:11,890
IT'S OK, FAY.

1423
01:47:11,932 --> 01:47:31,910
YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING.

1424
01:47:31,952 --> 01:47:34,413
YOU AND ME
TOGETHER FOREVER.

1425
01:47:34,454 --> 01:47:36,415
YOU REALLY BELIEVE
THAT, COLLIE?

1426
01:47:36,457 --> 01:47:41,920
YOU REALLY BELIEVE
THERE COULD BE A YOU AND ME?

1427
01:47:41,962 --> 01:47:43,922
I KNOW IT, FAY.

1428
01:47:44,305 --> 01:48:44,502
