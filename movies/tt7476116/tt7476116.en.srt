<i>You need to know from the get-go,
this is about nothing.</i>

3
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:42,536
<i>Just a geometrical contradiction.</i>

4
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,211
<i>The story of a dumb, round planet
revolving aimlessly</i>

5
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,965
<i>around a dumb, round sun
burning aimlessly.</i>

6
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,338
<i>The story of a round belly</i>

7
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,638
<i>purposefully containing
a round, gooey thing.</i>

8
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,965
<i>That becomes an un-gooey thing.</i>

9
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,343
<i>That looks at lots of round things.</i>

10
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,515
<i>The rounds of freedom.</i>

11
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:05,648
<i>Sophie's round dots.</i>

12
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,434
<i>Samantha's round rounds.</i>

13
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,190
<i>As round as people's round glasses.</i>

14
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,115
<i>Round.</i>

15
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,663
<i>It's also the tale
of a curve going straight</i>

16
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,033
<i>and becoming a rigid angle.</i>

17
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,624
<i>A square squishing a round
with the rule book.</i>

18
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,205
<i>A squared-off morality tale.</i>

19
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,667
<i>Square education.</i>

20
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,342
<i>Like square food at school,</i>

21
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,006
<i>college, university...</i>

22
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,717
<i>Square to the jaw like...</i>

23
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:42,893
It's over!

24
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,895
<i>As square as square people's glasses.</i>

25
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,064
Here we go.

26
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:48,858
<i>Square games.</i>

27
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,692
<i>Square office life.</i>

28
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,650
<i>Square. Like your father's cancer.</i>

29
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,073
<i>Square.</i>

30
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,238
<i>So we come to the contradictory aspect
of our story.</i>

31
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,870
<i>Of the few things we can be sure of,</i>

32
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,533
<i>there is one even the worst skeptics
cannot call into question.</i>

33
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,663
<i>A square peg never fits in a round hole.</i>

34
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,715
<i>Never.</i>

35
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,586
<i>And vice-versa.</i>

36
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,353
Morning, everybody.

37
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,900
Morning.

38
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,488
What about your cortisone?

39
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,277
I stopped. I get so bloated.

40
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,162
But it stops you sleeping all day.

41
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,574
Rest assured, honey, you're already fat.

42
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,836
You can bloat all you want,
it's like tennis socks in boots.

43
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,166
Nobody will notice.

44
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,297
I'll take it.

45
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,750
What's on the agenda today?

46
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,295
Playing Candy Crush on the couch.

47
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,719
No, not playing Candy Crush
on the couch.

48
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,930
I have my meeting with HR
this afternoon.

49
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,561
- It's today?
- At 3.

50
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,474
Six months waiting
and you sit on it all weekend?

51
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:54,394
I forgot it.

52
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,230
- Forgot?
- I didn't think.

53
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,988
I didn't want to think about it.

54
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,122
Come on, kids, let's go.

55
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,039
Have a good day, son.

56
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,328
I wanna die.

57
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,543
Obviously. It's your acne.
You'll be over it by lunch.

58
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:20,843
I hate you.

59
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,170
Obviously, too.

60
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,190
You good?

61
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,025
Let's go!

62
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:06,806
It doesn't matter.

63
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,890
Stuff happens.

64
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,134
Maybe it was too early.

65
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,595
No? I don't know.

66
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,139
What do you think?

67
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,924
SINK OR SWIM

68
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:51,619
One.

69
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:52,284
Two.

70
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,286
Grace. Elegance.

71
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:58,040
Five, six, seven, eight!

72
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,418
We can go, I'm ready.

73
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,655
<i>Swimmer wanted to join
men's synchronized swim team.</i>

74
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,531
<i>Amateurs welcome.</i>

75
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,363
The teacher said I didn't talk.

76
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,623
After, I did somersaults.

77
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,250
It was really good.

78
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,830
And flips and things.

79
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,088
The teacher said I had to leave class...

80
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:56,891
There's no federation,
league or whatever.

81
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,144
I guess we could start one
if we write letters

82
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,521
to someone somewhere.

83
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,478
We never discussed it much

84
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,938
'cause we don't give a damn.

85
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:12,157
Practice times depend on school days
and the water polo club.

86
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,408
Mondays, it's at 6:30.

87
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,909
Thursdays at 7,

88
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,914
but you can arrive
ten minutes later if you want.

89
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,369
It's no problem.

90
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,660
We do it for fun, after all.

91
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,294
It's not the army.

92
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,455
It's just a little...

93
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,418
I'm Thierry
but you can call me Titi.

94
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,257
No, Thierry's fine.

95
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,427
I don't know why I said that.
Nobody calls me Titi.

96
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,808
It's like, you big boob, right?

97
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,352
Yes, for sure.

98
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,599
I'm thrilled you answered the ad.
You'll see, we're one big family.

99
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,519
Not a real family, but kind of.

100
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,399
Welcome!

101
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,739
Guys!

102
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,701
Guys! This is Bertrand.

103
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,487
Hi, Bertrand.

104
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,365
Everybody in the pool.

105
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,003
Delphine!

106
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,840
This is Bertrand.
He called about the ad!

107
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,883
So what brings you here?

108
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,677
I don't really know.

109
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,646
You don't know?

110
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,180
You know what we do?

111
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,691
Yes, sure.
Synchronized swimming for men.

112
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,228
What is synchronized swimming for men?

113
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,818
The same as for women, I guess.

114
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:35,991
But for men.

115
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,236
- It made you want to sign up?
- Not exactly.

116
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,946
So what the hell brings you here?

117
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,115
Guys, it's called training!

118
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,248
Men's synchronized swimming

119
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,208
is not for everybody.

120
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,168
Many are called, few are chosen.

121
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,674
The guys you see here

122
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,713
aren't here by chance.

123
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,128
They want it.

124
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,131
To make this team, Bertrand,

125
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,009
you must combine willpower,
grace, rhythm

126
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,768
and a healthy lifestyle.

127
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,480
Can you cut it?

128
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,521
- You can swim at least?
- Sure. Quite well.

129
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,728
I don't know.

130
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,026
You know nothing, in fact.

131
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,324
Not anymore.

132
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,074
Great, you made the team.

133
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,119
Move! Locker room!

134
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:30,206
Grab trunks, cap, nose clip, goggles.
In the pool in 5!

135
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,496
Now that's a warm welcome.

136
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,881
Run along!

137
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,339
"What, no treason?

138
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,349
"This grief is without reason.

139
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,303
"It is indeed the worst pain

140
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,016
"Not to know why

141
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,226
"Without love, without hate
My heart suffers this fate."

142
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,694
Let's go again.

143
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,789
"Sweet sound of rain
On the earth and roofs

144
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,915
"For a heart that wanes

145
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,956
"Sweet is the song of rain!"

146
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,664
Knock it off now!

147
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,795
Pain in the ass! You all piss me off!

148
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,432
I didn't drive 40 minutes here for this!

149
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,058
I want to train!

150
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,475
Look at you! What the hell!

151
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,814
I want discipline!

152
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,608
I'm sick of it!

153
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,862
Very well, let's go again.

154
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,465
They made me do tests
like it was for a space flight.

155
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,761
Cholesterol level,
this level, that level.

156
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,055
Whatever. Two days it took,

157
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,724
only for them to send a letter saying,

158
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,775
I'm in super shape.

159
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,528
But I'm too old to get a mortgage.

160
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,691
38, and I'm too old.

161
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:24,949
It's absurd.

162
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,995
Now I keep obsessing about it.

163
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,408
I look at myself in the mirror

164
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,001
and find wrinkles.

165
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,337
I'm easily out of breath.

166
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,248
38 years old.

167
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,964
All because I wanted to buy a place.

168
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,133
I don't know
if you guys own your homes.

169
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,383
But I'm telling you, rent!

170
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,431
Save on metaphysical shit.

171
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,736
I appreciate it.

172
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,503
- Morning, boss.
- Morning.

173
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,656
You're up bright and early.
What are you doing?

174
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,699
Eating my apple turnover.

175
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,628
Say, Nicolas,

176
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,913
we open the store at 10.

177
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,047
Not 10:30.

178
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,920
- We open at 10:30.
- Don't.

179
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,130
- We do.
- Don't.

180
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,304
- Do!
- Don't!

181
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,129
It says so on the door!

182
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,262
It means 10 o'clock here.
10:30, ready to sell.

183
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,851
You arrive at 10:30 and then what?

184
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,388
Get a coffee,
check email and stuff.

185
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,397
That takes us to 11:30.

186
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,225
Meanwhile, folks come by,

187
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,859
looking for a pool.

188
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,315
These pools don't sell.

189
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,651
They don't sell, I lose money on them.

190
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,531
Nobody buys mine in the end.

191
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,367
Even afternoons are quiet.

192
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,871
Yes but...

193
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,536
I can talk like a boss sometimes, right?

194
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,537
Do you have any weed?

195
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,221
- It's me.
<i>- Two hours she's been waiting.</i>

196
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,887
I know, sorry. This guy...

197
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,517
<i>She's coming down.</i>

198
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,228
- All good?
<i>- Wonderful. Lola's on her way.</i>

199
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,320
Scissors.

200
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,450
Don't hold back.
Express yourself through the whole word.

201
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,286
Phyllo.

202
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,163
Good.

203
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,332
Banjo.

204
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,306
Your son is hindered.

205
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,341
He has a real mental blockage.

206
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,557
Communication between you is crucial.

207
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,767
Involve him, stimulate him.

208
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,853
Maybe drama classes or...

209
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,442
Excuse me, are you a shrink?

210
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,023
No, you're not a shrink.

211
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:52,441
So we'll stop there.
I don't pay you for a parenting lesson.

212
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,575
Just do your job, that's plenty.

213
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,212
Seventy-six!

214
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,632
- How are you feeling, champ?
- Copacetic.

215
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,092
They're rocking.

216
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:19,853
Not quite rocking.

217
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:20,979
Simon!

218
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,231
You're on after the bingo.
5-6 minutes, tops.

219
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,561
When I do this...

220
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,188
Has he got nerve issues?

221
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,896
So how was the party?

222
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,485
A lot of people turned up?

223
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,196
I wish I'd been there.

224
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,345
Here. Forty for you.

225
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,602
The blue spot during the intro,
did it dazzle you?

226
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,057
I could hardly see.

227
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,850
I'll try it behind.
Like you step out of a flying saucer.

228
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,485
Mauve then.

229
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,570
Mauve, sure.

230
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,063
Are you guys for real?

231
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,772
Take it easy!

232
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,309
What?

233
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,024
Third time this month
we've moved you on, sir.

234
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,031
We've played nice so far. Now beat it.

235
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,242
This isn't for camping,
it's for parking.

236
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,412
Ok, we're going.

237
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,995
- Right now.
- Sure.

238
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,452
They woke you up.

239
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,248
I'm going, dad.

240
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,629
Already? Without breakfast?

241
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,009
I'm not hungry.

242
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,220
I thought we'd spend the day together

243
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,131
and I'd drop you at mom's tonight.

244
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,717
It's your call but it's...

245
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,733
You didn't say, how was my gig?

246
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,812
And stretch.

247
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,313
What's stretching?

248
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,023
No, look, you're...

249
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,572
Too tight, too stiff. All wrong.

250
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,199
So scared of looking stupid,
you almost do.

251
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,660
Listening is crucial.

252
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,035
You need music in you
to make the world dance.

253
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,208
Stretch...

254
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,575
Mermaids, yes!

255
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,538
Let's find our inner woman.

256
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,839
I don't have an inner woman.

257
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:21,922
Bullshit. Finding her
might help you grow a pair.

258
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,212
I know I don't have one.

259
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,432
Reach up and stretch. Ballerinas!

260
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:28,727
Ballerina!

261
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,806
Let's find some grace.

262
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,888
It's in there somewhere.

263
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:37,443
Remember, we have a show coming up,
so let's be ready. Let's go!

264
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,352
Sorry, you're not in the gala.

265
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:40,904
You're not up to it.

266
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,073
Yeah.

267
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,234
He says, you'll see, it's an easy climb.

268
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,075
But I can see it's no easy climb.

269
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,706
So I say, watch out, I'm no...

270
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,500
I'm no mountaineer.

271
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,035
I hike for fun.

272
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,212
An amateur.

273
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,999
Simply to keep him company
and my auntie happy.

274
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,383
He's my stepfather.

275
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,675
He says, no, don't worry.

276
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,509
He insists.

277
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,385
I didn't follow him,
I stayed down below.

278
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,355
Is that it?

279
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,974
It really wasn't very interesting.

280
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,522
You say that 'cause it's Thierry?

281
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,027
I thought we agreed not to judge.

282
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,239
No judging, ok?

283
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,657
That's the rule.
Without rules, I'm gone.

284
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,159
He's right.
If we're judged, we won't talk.

285
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,946
Sorry but what he says
is always kinda weird.

286
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,493
That's my point.

287
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,374
No, thanks.
On anti-depressants, I can't.

288
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,632
I'm in depression.

289
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,963
A major depression.

290
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,554
I don't really know where to begin.

291
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,853
Two years now, I've been off work.

292
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,071
So long, guys!

293
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,822
See you, Simon.

294
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,281
Fuck!

295
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,241
Fucking shit!

296
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,666
Claire?

297
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,288
Is there any brandy for Thibault?

298
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,461
There.

299
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:10,341
Take it from me,
this country's going to hell.

300
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,469
I see it at work every day. Believe me.

301
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,262
People have no respect.

302
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,147
You're very quiet, Bertrand.

303
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:22,603
All good?

304
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:24,986
Great.

305
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,488
Better.

306
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:28,651
No, good.

307
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,695
Claire said you do sports.

308
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,487
That's good. Great!

309
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,612
What kind of sport?

310
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,572
I signed up for a...

311
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,910
A swim team. Synchronized swimming.

312
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,747
Remind me what that is.

313
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,917
Like in those 50s movies?

314
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:48,716
Water ballet?

315
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:49,759
That's right.

316
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,090
Isn't it for...

317
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,341
I mean, it's...

318
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,005
For women? Sure.

319
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:55,591
I'm sorry.

320
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,764
- But this is for men.
- Great.

321
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,104
After all, women play soccer.

322
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,144
My offer of a job at the store
is still open.

323
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,440
Thanks, I appreciate it.

324
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,695
It's no big deal.

325
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,778
When did you last get away?

326
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,780
Ever since Bertrand...

327
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,830
What's that? Two years?

328
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,248
Something like that.

329
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,707
Two years is a lot, don't you think?

330
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:30,921
I mean,

331
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,052
six months, a year maybe.

332
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,222
But two years!

333
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,097
Sure, but it's two years. Period.

334
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,974
Nothing against Bertrand.
I love the guy.

335
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,678
I'm worried, that's all.

336
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:43,559
I know.

337
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,524
My little darling sister.

338
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,617
Bye!

339
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,494
Remind me, never again.

340
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,705
15 years I've been reminding you.

341
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,754
That's horrible. I'm horrible.

342
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,795
It's not normal
to have these thoughts.

343
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,920
What thoughts?

344
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:18,715
I had an atrocious vision in my mind...

345
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,349
A comet?

346
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,851
How do you know?

347
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,473
I had the same vision.

348
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,352
I saw a glimmer in the sky,
like a star,

349
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,437
but it was blue, red, green.

350
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,570
It's alive, headed for us,
dazzling, about to flatten us but...

351
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,523
It slams into your sister's BMW.

352
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,533
Explosions, screams, flames!

353
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,319
All dead!

354
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,454
Atrocious.

355
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,415
I'm cold.

356
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:46,952
Let's go to bed.

357
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,000
Time, guys!

358
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,550
I know I'm a party pooper. Be cool.

359
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:02,509
I'm the one getting his knuckles
rapped by city hall.

360
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,928
9 o'clock does not mean 9:30.

361
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:10,020
If you want to stay later,
ask for permission.

362
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,060
Or go talk outside.

363
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,274
That's nonsense!

364
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:12,837
It's a thrill to see
so many of you here

365
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:16,966
for the fourth round
of the Interregional Water Polo Cup!

366
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:22,180
We have a water-themed
curtain-raiser for you.

367
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,803
They're nervous
before their first ever show.

368
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,431
Let's give a big hand

369
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,519
for our first
synchronized swim team for men.

370
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,190
That's right, for men!

371
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,360
Give it up!

372
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,557
That's your team?

373
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,879
Magnificent!

374
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,894
Let's hear it for them!

375
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,984
Never an easy discipline,
synchronized swimming.

376
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,409
Time now for the ball game!

377
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,032
Time for some water polo!

378
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,451
Our fourth-round match

379
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,294
between Jugnac

380
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,796
and Chevigny-Le-Ouin.

381
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,389
Team mates forever!

382
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,053
I'm so proud of you.

383
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,023
Bravo!

384
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:38,687
It was...

385
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,726
Bravo for what? We were shit.

386
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,696
Look at them. Like they won the cup.

387
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,398
They're having fun.

388
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,736
They look happy.

389
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,613
Sure, they look happy.

390
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,029
Looking isn't being.

391
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,913
Sounds like
someone's more depressed than me.

392
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,384
Our first performance. It was insane.
The crowd went wild.

393
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,921
I'm super proud of the guys.

394
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,800
I just wanted to tell you.
Love you, bye.

395
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:14,890
Guys...

396
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,267
I gotta go or he'll go crazy.

397
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:18,441
- Sure?
- Yeah.

398
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,146
- Thanks, Delphine.
- See you. You were great!

399
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,864
I'll be going too. Need a ride?

400
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:28,284
With pleasure.

401
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,000
I've released seventeen CDs.

402
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,414
More or less self-produced.

403
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,083
Really? No kidding!

404
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:46,802
Not a single hit.

405
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:47,970
Not one.

406
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,131
I don't give a damn.

407
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,891
What I love doing
is singing, expressing myself.

408
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,393
Not selling records.

409
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,430
Sure, you have to stay free.

410
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,686
Exactly. Look at me!

411
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,230
How about this for freedom!

412
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,529
All this time,
did I ever ask for a favor?

413
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,447
Except the 3,000-euro loan.

414
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:11,200
Besides money. Let's elevate the debate.

415
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,615
I mean, a favor for a friend.

416
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:15,947
The poor guy has nothing in his life.

417
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,867
Home, the pool. The pool, home.

418
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,123
He needs to get laid.

419
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,164
I doubt he ever got laid in his life.

420
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,424
Sure, I did.

421
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,003
I've done it.

422
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,634
I made love.

423
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,761
Leave this to me, will you?

424
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:32,756
You bang me, right?

425
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,596
- So bang him. Same difference!
- Totally not.

426
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:39,053
Marcus, let it go.
I don't think she wants to.

427
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,438
No, she doesn't.

428
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,893
Let it go.

429
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,933
No, don't let it go, you jerk!

430
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:47,822
Did I upset you?

431
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:49,189
Guys, let's go.

432
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,075
Great job.

433
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,241
Pay up. I forgot my wallet.

434
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,862
You often forget it.

435
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,790
I'll pay you back tomorrow.
Here's the thing...

436
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,622
You won't get laid being a tightwad.

437
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,662
Women detest a tightwad.

438
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,335
Black mark for you
but I've got your back.

439
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:08,169
Wait!

440
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,551
No, my friend's buying.

441
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,596
Mr. Marcus!

442
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,762
What?

443
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,720
Sorry to bother you,
but we need to talk.

444
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,143
Duty calls, sorry.

445
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,936
I'm the boss, the CEO.

446
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,645
Have fun.
That button there changes the colors.

447
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,190
This can't go on.

448
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,104
What can't?

449
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,865
I told you 4 months ago.
Nothing happened.

450
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,409
Something has to give.
We owe 150,000

451
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,861
to our suppliers.

452
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,993
And no income to cover loans.

453
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:41,957
I'll get by.

454
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,586
You don't get it.
We'll be bankrupt before Xmas.

455
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:49,874
Before Xmas?

456
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,670
- You're sure of the math?
- Sure.

457
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,517
Call her a cab, will you, please?

458
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,230
Hello.

459
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,814
My name's Delphine. I'm an alcoholic.

460
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,437
I've been sober five years now.

461
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,690
It started when I was 26.

462
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:19,616
I was doing
artistic swimming in duet.

463
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,830
It was international level,
competing in championships.

464
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,369
And I won a lot of them.

465
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,788
We won a lot, my partner and I.

466
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,717
For me,
those were the best years of my life.

467
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:36,345
It was a wonderful time. Awesome.

468
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,222
And then...

469
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,555
Then came a major incident.

470
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:46,731
She was forced
to give up swimming with me.

471
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,562
To give up swimming, period.

472
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,359
Likewise for me.

473
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,146
My whole career had been with her.

474
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,861
Without her, it just wasn't right.

475
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,071
I think I...

476
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:00,703
I should've been there for her then.

477
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:06,701
Instead, I blamed her
for us being forced to quit.

478
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,337
Now I have only myself to blame.

479
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,799
Back then,
competition, the pool and stuff.

480
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,710
It left a hole in my life.

481
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,054
She...

482
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,138
left a hole in my life.

483
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,725
I was broken.

484
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,060
I couldn't see...

485
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,598
I was just surviving until the first,

486
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,809
you guessed it, gin and tonic.

487
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:34,487
I had never drunk alcohol.
It was my first time.

488
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:37,023
You can imagine what happened next.

489
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,112
Just falling.

490
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,070
I thought about ending it all.

491
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,532
What saved me

492
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,997
was, on the one hand, my team

493
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,253
of male synchronized swimmers.

494
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:56,125
Yes, I coach a team
with serious potential.

495
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,966
But what really hauled me
out of deep shit...

496
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,137
As lame as it sounds...

497
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,844
It could be a line

498
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:08,684
from music in a supermarket...

499
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,313
Was love.

500
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,486
Saying it now, I could slap myself,
but it's true.

501
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,065
He saved my life.

502
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,210
Hi Serge, this is Bertrand,
our new hire.

503
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:32,957
Show him the ropes.

504
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:37,166
I won't put you here
until you're up to speed.

505
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,835
Morning, ma'am. Excellent choice.

506
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,961
Hey, guys, break over!

507
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,968
Here, we have the high-end models.

508
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,352
This is the cafeteria-slash-break room.

509
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,979
Staff come here for coffee and stuff.

510
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,311
What's going on here?

511
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,519
Your uniform.

512
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,986
We have a Bertrand with great sales.
I can't...

513
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,163
See?

514
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,952
Welcome. See you in convertibles
for a briefing.

515
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,870
Convertibles?

516
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:12,795
Sofas.

517
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,875
This is a furniture store.

518
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,789
It's gotta go faster up there.

519
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,425
See you later.

520
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:24,013
- You thought it over?
- I'm not quite sure but yes.

521
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:25,260
Thought what over?

522
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,550
- His foreign language option.
- And?

523
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,311
I think

524
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,728
I'll go for Spanish.

525
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,107
Spanish?

526
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,982
You think or you're sure?

527
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,063
Sure, I guess.

528
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,236
Spanish gets you nowhere.

529
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:41,898
- Spanish gets you nowhere?
- Nowhere.

530
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,445
Why take Spanish?

531
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:47,407
Our roots.

532
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,743
I mean, yours and granny's.

533
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:51,912
Who said that?

534
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,166
You said that?

535
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,336
About my mother?

536
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:56,955
Why talk about her?

537
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:58,915
Dad, please. Calm down.

538
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:00,549
Are you stupid or what?

539
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,426
Why stir up all that shit?

540
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,426
Stop, dammit!

541
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,596
Stop it!

542
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,729
If you want,
I'll make pancakes tonight, ok?

543
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,615
So we're patched through here.

544
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:27,953
And here.

545
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,112
Look. See how it works?

546
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,541
Yes.

547
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,788
- You're sure?
- Yes.

548
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:37,836
Imagine the pump
fails to start one night.

549
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,544
An alert flashes up. What do you do?

550
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:44,802
I use the mouse and I tap on...

551
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,347
- I tap on...
- "I click."

552
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,760
"Tap" works too, right?
If I prefer.

553
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:52,551
I guess.

554
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:55,472
That's an interesting word, click.

555
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,640
Where does that come from? Click?

556
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,850
- Thierry, it's late.
- Yes.

557
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,020
The pH level is shown by this line.

558
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,758
At midnight, it kicks in automatically.

559
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:08,117
Cover, filter, water level,
pH levels, everything.

560
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,829
Alright.

561
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,118
So what do I do?

562
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,534
Nothing. The computer runs it.

563
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,920
So what's the point of me?

564
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,841
You put away the floats.

565
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:54,826
Where are you?

566
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:57,626
Where?

567
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,036
Stupid animals, cats.

568
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:22,668
Mr. Marcus?

569
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,749
Nobody ever taught you to knock?

570
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:28,924
You still haven't paid my wages.
Four months is too long.

571
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:32,006
- Really? How much do I owe you?
- 5,600 euros.

572
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,470
5,600! Gracious.

573
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,882
Where did I put my checkbook?

574
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:40,554
Nicolas, first of all,
see that sign we're so proud of?

575
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,687
- My check.
- What does it say?

576
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,520
My check, nonsense!
What does the sign say?

577
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,479
PoolLove!

578
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,402
Pools sold with love. From the heart.

579
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,072
In a world of people
withdrawing into themselves,

580
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,073
fear sweeps the streets but we...

581
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,285
I want my check!

582
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,077
"I want my check"?

583
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,863
No more memories?
No more smiles? No more...

584
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,532
I have work to do.

585
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,833
Tell me when it's ready!

586
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:09,298
I'll write your damn check!
I'll write it right now!

587
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:13,586
Instead of PoolLove, go work
at PoolCash. I'll write your check.

588
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,550
- Do it!
- When I find my pen.

589
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,966
I'll add an extra 100
just to shut your big mouth!

590
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,975
Anyway, it'll bounce.

591
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,769
Tell it to the court!

592
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,638
Tell what to the court?

593
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,854
The court will be delighted
to hear you deal drugs at work.

594
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,609
Let's see how that flies.

595
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:32,821
- What's up now?
- Where's the van?

596
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,282
No idea. Wherever you left it.

597
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,325
I didn't touch it!

598
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,452
This is very serious, Nicolas.

599
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,740
Whatever you did with the van,
you can tell me. Shoot.

600
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,125
I just told you, I didn't touch it.

601
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:49,837
Holy shit!

602
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:57,005
I'm cursed!
Why are you tormenting me?

603
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,014
What did I do to deserve this?

604
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:01,634
No matter...

605
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,394
Let's not get our panties in a wad.

606
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,097
Hurry to the police, report the theft.

607
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,232
I'll file the insurance claim.

608
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:11,894
No, forget the insurance.
We stopped paying.

609
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:13,854
A waste of money, you said.

610
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:17,692
- What did I say?
- That insurance was a waste of money.

611
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,087
Lola!

612
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,761
Happy birthday, sweetie.

613
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,679
You'll see, I nailed it.

614
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:44,934
Unlike last year.

615
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,646
Sure.

616
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:47,937
Open it.

617
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,107
Later.

618
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,232
- C'mon, open it.
- No, later.

619
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,018
- How come?
- Back off!

620
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,401
I'll open it at home.

621
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,084
Hello.

622
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:16,174
I wanted to tell you guys...

623
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,177
Go ahead, sorry.

624
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,179
You wanna talk? No problem.

625
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,716
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

626
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:27,428
It's not easy.

627
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:29,938
I feel like...

628
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:34,022
Everything I touch is destined to fail.

629
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,484
I'd have loved to be a guy...

630
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,821
One of those guys you see on TV,

631
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,361
those guys snapping their fingers...

632
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,614
Moving and shaking, making it happen.

633
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,495
An entrepreneur.

634
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:54,501
Kind of like Michael Douglas
in <i>Wall Street,</i> you see?

635
00:43:57,677 --> 00:44:01,637
I guess being held back in 5th grade
wasn't a good sign.

636
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,934
People say, believe in your dreams,
they'll come true.

637
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:08,681
It's a lie.

638
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,809
I'm in deep shit, guys.

639
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,565
I'm this far from going bankrupt.
For the fourth time.

640
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:23,025
One year here and nobody knows,
nobody gives a damn about my pools.

641
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:27,617
What lunatic would build a pool
in this neck of the woods?

642
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:28,874
Me.

643
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,666
That's sweet, Thierry.

644
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,999
As my ex-wife used to say,

645
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:38,883
Marcus, it's not only your pools
that are cracked.

646
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:43,716
Anyway, sorry...

647
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:49,027
<i>synchronized swimming men</i>

648
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,784
Fuck a duck!

649
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,277
Japan, Germany, New Zealand...

650
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:25,656
- Every country!
- The world championships!

651
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,617
Italy...

652
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:29,409
England, Portugal...

653
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,069
We'll take down Portugal.

654
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,325
How come?

655
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,326
Portugal, come on!

656
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:37,080
- When is it?
- April.

657
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,165
- Is that enough time?
- Enough time?

658
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,500
For training.

659
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:44,587
Seriously? Check out the competition.

660
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,591
- So?
- Yeah!

661
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,299
It's in Norway. It'll cost a fortune.

662
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,384
We're just thinking out loud.

663
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,049
I say no out loud.

664
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,596
You say no out loud?

665
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,059
Just like that.

666
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:57,395
How about you tell us why?

667
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:02,059
We suck as the warm-up act
at a crappy regional championship.

668
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:03,773
Wake up!

669
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,654
World championships!

670
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,901
It's pure fantasy.

671
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,362
Fantasy, reality.
You get the difference?

672
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:15,031
If you were so right, you'd lose
the condescending asshole air.

673
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:20,623
You wouldn't be telling
a bunch of losers that they're losers.

674
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:24,631
Two things you're cruelly lacking
are sympathy and enthusiasm.

675
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,086
And a smile. 3 things!

676
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:30,383
We'd appreciate it
if you'd leave the losers alone.

677
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,890
You're team spokesman now, are you?

678
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,683
Just like you, so far.

679
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:39,225
This is bullshit! Look at him...

680
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,811
He's a washout whose life is a mess.

681
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,270
Sorry, I forgot.

682
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:44,525
He's in depression.

683
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,484
In depression?
It's an excuse and you know it.

684
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:52,901
You're a flake, beating yourself up
about flunking on your dreams.

685
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,992
You have a monopoly on depression?

686
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,619
It's got us all. All of us!

687
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:02,873
For a year now, we've shared our lives,
talking and training.

688
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:04,413
Sure, I'm a loudmouth.

689
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,583
Sure, I'm pissed off.
But I don't lie to them or myself.

690
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,798
I know I'm a loser
but that's fine by me.

691
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:15,215
Why go lose my last shred of dignity
'cause an angry jerk decrees it?

692
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,893
This asshole doesn't need a medal
to solve his problems.

693
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:21,146
I think we could all use a medal.

694
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,450
He's right.

695
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:41,283
Let's vote on it. Who's in favor?

696
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,414
Ok, it's agreed!

697
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,333
Sign us up.

698
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:47,543
What do I put?

699
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:48,999
Team France.

700
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:52,419
- TF for short.
- Sounds like WTF. That sucks.

701
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,220
- Sucks ass!
- Grow up.

702
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:58,600
Men's Synchronized Swimming
Team of France.

703
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:00,719
That makes MSSFT.

704
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,767
No, MSSTF.

705
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,891
Stop! Just put Team France.

706
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,936
Why not The Human Dolphins?

707
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,608
Knock it off, Thierry.

708
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,282
Just put Team France.

709
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,235
- Caps.
- There, E!

710
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,782
You type like a cop, Thierry!

711
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:29,881
We are Team France!

712
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:32,175
- Look at you!
- That's us!

713
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:36,672
Why are you like this?

714
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:40,597
What's blocking you?
What makes you block everything?

715
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,385
Why are you a pain in the ass?

716
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:43,563
I'm not.

717
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,477
Pain in the ass!
Come and drink with us!

718
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:47,773
See?

719
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:13,504
We're gonna practice
your entry in the water.

720
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,464
You dive like potatoes.

721
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:17,630
- I disagree...
- I said like potatoes.

722
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,549
I want you to scythe
through air and water.

723
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,934
You scythe through neither.

724
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:27,147
You need to scream and leap,
leap and scream.

725
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:28,648
It's today's exercise.

726
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:31,025
It must be a primal scream,
so listen up.

727
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:34,654
In turn, without thinking,
launch yourselves and yell a word.

728
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,689
The first word that comes to mind.

729
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:38,366
Jump or dive?

730
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:39,947
I believe I said dive.

731
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,905
- This is ridiculous.
- No, you're ridiculous.

732
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,494
Don't think, do it.

733
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,415
Let's go!

734
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,710
Ridiculous!

735
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,956
Mortgage!

736
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:50,620
Prozac!

737
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:52,790
Smokieblankieflash!

738
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:55,967
He didn't get the idea.

739
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:58,549
No, he didn't get it.

740
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,801
5, 6, 7, 8...

741
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,467
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8!

742
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,847
Guys, it's crap!
You're so not in sync.

743
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:10,315
You're kidding me.

744
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:13,272
You're floppy,
floppier than anything I ever saw!

745
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:14,445
Let's go again.

746
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:19,820
Bravo, guys. Great job!

747
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,037
Practice over.

748
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:26,949
Give yourselves a big hand.
That was extraordinary!

749
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:28,459
We're here.

750
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:30,035
No, we're up here!

751
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:31,623
Let's go!

752
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,998
You're hitting your peak! Artists!

753
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:38,176
I'm seeing aquatic artists!
The real deal!

754
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:41,554
I know them when I see them!
In all modesty, big up!

755
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,803
That was something else.

756
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,560
Locker room.

757
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:46,978
Champions!

758
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:01,533
My champs!

759
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:05,825
"Sweet sound of rain
On the earth and roofs

760
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:09,290
"For a heart that wanes

761
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:12,035
"Sweet is the song of rain"

762
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,164
- What are you doing?
- The robot dance.

763
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:17,173
- That's not right.
- It is.

764
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,135
It's terrible.

765
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:31,187
Ok, great. That was amazing.

766
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:35,101
Most people can't tell man from machine.

767
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:39,196
I introduced the robot dance
into France, back in '82.

768
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:40,573
Delphine!

769
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,611
Come over here, will you?

770
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,410
Come on!

771
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,533
I wanna talk, dammit!

772
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,619
You realize what you're doing?

773
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,913
Don't touch me! Butt out!

774
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,958
Don't come by, don't call me.
Leave me alone!

775
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,916
I don't love you, I never loved you.

776
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,710
Two years since we broke up. Jesus!

777
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:05,547
I have a wife and baby.
How do I get it into your head?

778
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,262
Stupid bitch, you're wrecking my life!

779
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:09,977
Beat it!

780
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,271
I reported her to the cops, ok?

781
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:47,596
- It's full of fungi.
- Bullshit! It's super chlorinated.

782
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,770
Let's go.

783
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,398
Take it easy, go over the...

784
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:05,694
The choreography.

785
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,289
Come on!

786
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,043
Get in the water!

787
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:47,608
You dumb bitch!

788
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:01,754
Hold on, let me...

789
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:04,294
Did I ask for anything?

790
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:08,512
- I'm lending a hand.
- Scratch your ass with it. In line!

791
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:14,263
You really think
you're gonna win like this?

792
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,435
We just wanna take part.

793
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:18,100
Excuse me?

794
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,809
We just wanna take part.

795
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,149
- Sonofabitch!
- You're nuts!

796
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:23,897
I'm what?

797
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:25,524
Nothing!

798
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:29,108
Fun's over! We're going for a run.

799
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,866
I don't have my running gear.

800
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:33,991
No problem.

801
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:40,378
Let's go!

802
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:41,752
Move it!

803
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,505
Keep going!

804
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,587
Run! Eyes front!

805
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,543
Move that fat ass!

806
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,551
Shit!

807
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:50,721
Stand up!

808
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,177
Cut the crap and run! Move!

809
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:57,101
Come and explain the respiratory system.

810
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:00,430
The respiratory system

811
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:01,941
works...

812
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,317
I know it.

813
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:10,323
Sit down!

814
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:11,784
F...

815
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:13,238
C...

816
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,410
From the top! C...

817
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,744
It's not the Sri Lankan alphabet!

818
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:21,544
16...

819
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:22,712
17...

820
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,332
C'mon, assholes!

821
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,589
You just wanna take part?

822
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,417
I'll show you taking part!

823
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:31,052
We're here to win!

824
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:34,256
Air enters the buccal cavity.
The mouth.

825
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:37,221
Fine particles go through the trachea.

826
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:41,054
For right or left lung, air goes down...

827
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,597
You have no idea!

828
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:43,935
Back to your seat!

829
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:45,520
I told you to learn it!

830
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:47,352
Theory is very important.

831
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:50,363
No stopping! No walking!

832
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,525
I'll teach you what effort means!

833
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:57,032
Delphine?

834
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:02,041
I passed by the bank.
They said you were off sick.

835
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:06,254
Some mail came for you at the pool.

836
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:12,336
And I should tell you,
your friend is coaching us now.

837
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:17,382
She says we suck but there's no reason
for the others to be any better.

838
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:21,302
We've really improved.
You should see it.

839
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,773
The thing is, she doesn't read to us
and she's mean.

840
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:29,477
Marcus says she's a bitch,

841
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:31,779
but I think

842
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:34,240
maybe she's a little

843
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,532
shy.

844
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:40,993
I don't know if you're there or not,
but I hope you're good.

845
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:50,381
She'll be happy to see you.
She gets few visitors.

846
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,384
Except your sister
at Christmas and birthdays.

847
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:56,804
That is your sister?
Plump, quite pretty.

848
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,181
My half-sister.

849
00:57:58,684 --> 00:57:59,845
Fresh, isn't she?

850
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,097
I don't know.

851
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:03,557
This way.

852
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:05,809
Under the trees.

853
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:09,772
I should warn you, don't expect...

854
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:11,237
You know.

855
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,108
She's still...

856
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,155
She's still my mother. I know.

857
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,155
I'll be going.

858
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:19,370
Thank you.

859
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,639
Hello, mom.

860
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,053
My son! You came to see me.

861
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:47,430
That makes me so happy.

862
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:49,558
Same here.

863
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:54,319
Sorry I couldn't come more often but...

864
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:57,691
Honey, you have your life.
It's only normal.

865
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:00,322
How's Diane? And the little one?

866
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:03,238
They're good. They send their love.

867
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:06,248
Weather's good.

868
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,872
You're not too warm in that coat?

869
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:13,631
There's always a nice breeze
under the trees. It's pleasant.

870
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:19,630
You still have
your horrendous face, though.

871
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:22,093
Astonishing how ugly you are.

872
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:26,223
Your idiot father was no oil painting
but you are hideous.

873
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:27,438
Ghastly.

874
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:31,061
You selfish piece of shit.

875
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,267
Look at you, little vermin.

876
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:36,779
That rotten, shapeless face of yours.

877
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:38,068
Alright, mom.

878
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:41,075
Alright, mom!
That's all you can say.

879
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:44,237
Why didn't I stab my gut
rather than endure your ugliness

880
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,530
my entire life?

881
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,865
That's right, beat it!

882
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,499
You're ugly!

883
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,293
You're gruesome!

884
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:54,539
Listen up, fatties!

885
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:57,709
There's a question maybe needs asking.

886
00:59:58,095 --> 00:59:59,961
What music do you plan to use?

887
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,093
We need something dynamic and upbeat.

888
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:06,350
You think so?
I had in mind sluggish and limp.

889
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,603
No, that's terrible. People will...

890
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:09,772
Not another word.

891
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,935
- It's gotta be rock.
- Well?

892
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,476
Not salsa! No way!

893
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:16,862
<i>My Rocking Heart?</i>

894
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,195
Something with oomph.

895
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:19,776
Opera would be stunning.

896
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,612
<i>Melissa My Babe From Ibiza!</i>

897
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:22,785
Rap. Has to be.

898
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:25,411
A track we relate to,
that tells our story.

899
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:28,323
He's right. From our heyday.
A song like us.

900
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,500
We're old.

901
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:30,329
We're not old!

902
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:34,166
We are, but we have to own it,
find music that's a fit.

903
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,375
<i>The Chick in Nylons?</i>

904
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:36,756
You like power pop.

905
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:37,665
Love it!

906
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:38,884
Stop now.

907
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:42,513
No rhythm.

908
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:44,343
He had a swim team.

909
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:47,016
- Your brain's a sewer.
- It's impressive.

910
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:51,808
Some great arm movements.

911
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:54,607
I like that. Or Led Zep or U2.

912
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:56,563
Radiohead?

913
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:58,611
- What?
- Radiohead.

914
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:07,746
Simon!

915
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:09,072
Just a second.

916
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,419
- See you, Jean-Luc.
- Bye.

917
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:29,717
Serge can't work Thursday night.

918
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:32,015
You'll replace him.

919
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,396
But I have practice.

920
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:36,817
Maybe so.

921
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,654
Feet in the middle.

922
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:49,904
Don't forget to breathe.

923
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:54,084
Point those toes!

924
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:57,249
Feet in the middle!

925
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:00,081
What the hell, Avanish?

926
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,883
Get your feet in the middle!

927
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:05,211
Scull!

928
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:10,267
It's shit!

929
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:11,934
It's shit! It's pointless!

930
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:13,389
Who's the base?

931
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:14,891
What's a base?

932
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:16,649
What's a base?

933
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:19,642
You must be joking.

934
01:02:20,612 --> 01:02:22,774
You're going to the Worlds
without a base?

935
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:28,238
The base is the guy
who holds his breath!

936
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:30,744
Who can hold his breath?

937
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,276
47 seconds. Useless!

938
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:05,567
I coach little girls
who do two minutes!

939
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,740
And you?

940
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:11,198
No base means no lifts,
no star, no show, no Worlds!

941
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:12,904
From now on,

942
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,658
you all stop breathing!

943
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:20,085
47 seconds.

944
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,422
Sure, it sucks!

945
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:26,967
I am not lying.

946
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:28,469
You, 47. Me, 1.10.

947
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:46,938
I'd take my first drink
and throw it down the sink.

948
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:48,731
I'd only drink the second.

949
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,159
Merrily, carefree.

950
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:54,953
Silly, isn't it?

951
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:03,830
Attention to detail
makes all the difference.

952
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:06,670
Same outfit, same trunks, all in black.

953
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,379
We're a team, we look good.

954
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:11,842
In this day and age,
image is crucial, Laurent. Crucial!

955
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:15,807
I don't give a shit about image.
People obsess about it.

956
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,310
I couldn't agree more.

957
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,721
I totally agree.

958
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:23,016
On the other hand,
it's our modern-day reality.

959
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:25,643
Good job, Titi!

960
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:29,696
I'd love to screw the system
but image is everything.

961
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:33,613
I did three lengths! Three!

962
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:38,205
After the second, I had nothing left,
I started to come up.

963
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:41,288
But I wanted to keep going.
So you know what?

964
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,286
I thought of my stepfather.

965
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:45,921
He was a bizarre man.

966
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:48,208
Some nights, he came into my room.

967
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:50,422
He put me in a headlock like that

968
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:53,595
and burned my eyelashes
with his cigarillos.

969
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:57,516
But only when my mom worked nights.

970
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:59,972
Whenever I heard him come upstairs,

971
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,805
I hid in the laundry basket

972
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:05,767
and held my breath
so I wouldn't make a noise.

973
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,151
On my third length just now,

974
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:10,070
I remembered that basket.

975
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,356
And I did it!

976
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:12,991
I did it!

977
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:16,118
It's all in the mind.

978
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:22,370
My ear's clogged up.

979
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:31,133
You cannot deny
that style is important.

980
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:33,878
How much does style come in at?

981
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:36,056
All inclusive?

982
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:37,757
289 euros.

983
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:39,726
The whole lot?

984
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:41,145
Per person.

985
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:43,516
But it includes trunks, robe...

986
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,807
You're nuts! They can't even pay rent.

987
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:48,063
Which is why I have a plan B.

988
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:49,897
Plan Foxy.

989
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:51,820
- Wanna hear it?
- No.

990
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:53,982
I'll tell you anyway. Listen.

991
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:01,072
You're shitting me?

992
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:08,917
I'm messing with you!

993
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:16,254
Those are maki.

994
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,050
I said sushi, not maki!

995
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:19,305
I hate maki.

996
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:22,051
Alright, give me them. Come on.

997
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:23,270
Gimme.

998
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:28,150
Yeah, what?

999
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,148
Nothing.

1000
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:51,876
What do you think?

1001
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:55,626
Imagine it with bass and drums.

1002
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:56,803
Great.

1003
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:58,222
Really good.

1004
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:05,685
How much?

1005
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:08,935
259 euros.

1006
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:11,274
- Too much.
- No way!

1007
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:14,274
How about we stay mismatched?

1008
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:18,194
I knew you'd say that.

1009
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:20,450
Which is why I have

1010
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:21,995
a plan B.

1011
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,163
Plan Foxy.

1012
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:24,331
Why Foxy?

1013
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:25,868
Because it's sly.

1014
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:28,075
True. Foxes are sly.

1015
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:31,287
Wanna hear it?

1016
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:36,174
<i>My plan has got every detail down.</i>

1017
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:41,009
<i>Just pile the gear in a cart
like a regular customer.</i>

1018
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:45,176
<i>Use pliers from Home Improvement
to cut the emergency exit chain.</i>

1019
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:48,016
<i>The door opens onto the parking lot.</i>

1020
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:50,768
<i>The getaway car waits there,</i>

1021
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:52,228
<i>ready to burn rubber.</i>

1022
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:58,799
We get a lot of theft but come on!

1023
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:01,005
Bathing suits! How old are you?

1024
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:02,294
53.

1025
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:04,129
- 38.
- 41 and a half.

1026
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:05,718
We're not proud, you know.

1027
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,804
You pay up
or we call the cops?

1028
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:08,888
Easy, easy.

1029
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:10,724
We'll pay up, of course.

1030
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:14,435
- Thierry...
- What?

1031
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:15,941
You got a checkbook?

1032
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:17,393
Perhaps.

1033
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,527
- Pay.
- Certainly not.

1034
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,356
Call the police.

1035
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:26,656
- How much is it?
- 1,258 euros.

1036
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:37,250
Let's go!

1037
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:42,342
Cool it, we paid.

1038
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:44,638
Calm down.

1039
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:48,427
I'm not kidding, pay me back fast.

1040
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,681
I'm sick of being your fool.

1041
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,891
I never make a fool of you. Never.

1042
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:55,065
Not you, him!

1043
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:56,233
Me?

1044
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:59,484
I tell him about my love life
and he makes a fool of me.

1045
01:09:59,654 --> 01:10:02,943
Get to know people
before judging them.

1046
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:05,357
I'm an iceberg.

1047
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,951
I only let people see the tip.

1048
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:09,237
The bit underwater...

1049
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:10,575
The submerged part.

1050
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:11,621
Exactly.

1051
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:15,125
That bit has made love
to countless women.

1052
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:16,664
A lot.

1053
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:19,831
Countless means what exactly?

1054
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:21,589
Keep your nose out!

1055
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,627
We're your friends. Tell us how many.

1056
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:25,846
One?

1057
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:28,682
Two?

1058
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:31,763
Three?

1059
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:33,353
There you go.

1060
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:34,891
Three?

1061
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,022
I'm nobody's fool now!

1062
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:41,435
One thing's for sure, we have style.

1063
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,210
Don't worry.

1064
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:59,370
What Marcus breaks, Marcus fixes.

1065
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:03,048
- Leave your wife to me.
- That may not be a good idea.

1066
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:16,053
That black look in her eye...

1067
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,392
A woman of character. Aries, right?

1068
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:20,057
My sister's Aries.

1069
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,441
No, it's not...

1070
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:30,442
See you tomorrow, Bertrand!

1071
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:31,828
Hi, Claire.

1072
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:54,133
- How's it going?
- Good.

1073
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:56,764
And with your mother?

1074
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:59,100
Badly, but it always has with her,

1075
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:00,684
so let's say we're fine.

1076
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:02,815
Thanks for all you do for her.

1077
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,521
You're welcome. It's my job.

1078
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:06,270
You do it well.

1079
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:08,939
It wasn't always the case.

1080
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:11,696
I wanted to race motorcycles.

1081
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:15,321
Trouble is, I'm no competitor.

1082
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:17,910
Stress management close to zero.

1083
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:22,536
- Who are the anxiolytics for?
- Mrs. Chamblain.

1084
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:24,705
- She already had hers.
- Sure?

1085
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:36,054
I was hired for six months
and here I am.

1086
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:38,894
I thought
I wouldn't stick it out 3 days.

1087
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:39,894
How come?

1088
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:41,180
The smell.

1089
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:46,147
It's a terrible thing to say,
and I shouldn't, but it's the truth.

1090
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,561
Old folks stink.

1091
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,066
They stink horribly.

1092
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:52,361
You arrive, it's clean,
they're showered, all good.

1093
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:54,284
But when they wake up,

1094
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:55,986
it's like a zoo here.

1095
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:57,241
Carnage.

1096
01:13:04,005 --> 01:13:05,246
Morning, sir.

1097
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:10,000
I developed a technique
to do a whole room...

1098
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:13,337
Sheets, bedpan, basic ablutions...

1099
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:15,592
while holding my breath.

1100
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:40,999
A whole room?

1101
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:42,083
Yes.

1102
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:43,624
Without a breath?

1103
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:44,878
Yes.

1104
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:04,471
- How long?
- 3 minutes 52.

1105
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:07,019
Is that good?

1106
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:09,736
Not bad.

1107
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:10,936
No, it's decent.

1108
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:12,614
It's great!

1109
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:13,823
No, it's decent.

1110
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:18,114
I'm gonna play you a track.

1111
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:21,746
It's a bit intimidating
in front of you all.

1112
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:25,955
Feel free to say what you think,
even if you don't like it.

1113
01:14:26,337 --> 01:14:28,249
It needs mixing and arranging.

1114
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:29,788
It's a rough draft.

1115
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:33,049
But try to imagine what it'll be like

1116
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:34,219
when I finish it.

1117
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:35,303
There we go.

1118
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:36,429
Now I'll...

1119
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:38,672
- Go for it.
- Yeah, here goes.

1120
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:40,215
I'm so nervous.

1121
01:15:08,379 --> 01:15:09,379
You ok?

1122
01:15:09,547 --> 01:15:11,038
You're asking me that?

1123
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:12,756
Sure, why?

1124
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:15,296
I'm amazed you'd be interested.

1125
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:18,344
Thank you for the present.

1126
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:20,847
You're welcome, sweetie.

1127
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,674
I didn't mess up?

1128
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:26,436
No, it's exactly what I wanted.
Except for the color.

1129
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:30,107
So it's not exactly what you wanted.

1130
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:32,358
Which color did you want?

1131
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:35,396
Blue's good but red's really good too.

1132
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:36,905
So we have a problem.

1133
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:38,982
Blue's blue. It's not red.

1134
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:41,618
Forget that
and this sponge is your fate.

1135
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:47,369
Don't you have class?

1136
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:58,422
I thought
it'd be a great surprise for them.

1137
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:01,885
I expected to get an ovation
but nobody even clapped.

1138
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:03,556
They said nothing.

1139
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:04,768
Nothing.

1140
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:06,811
Pathetic.

1141
01:16:07,313 --> 01:16:09,396
I wasn't there to hear it but...

1142
01:16:12,026 --> 01:16:13,938
Maybe they were right not to clap.

1143
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:17,904
I have talent. I have serious talent.

1144
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:20,531
Lots of people will tell you.

1145
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:23,235
At the conservatory,
I was the next big star.

1146
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:26,071
I had something. That extra something.

1147
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:30,583
Maybe I didn't make the right choices.

1148
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:32,585
That's not what I'm saying, dad.

1149
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:34,792
Maybe they were right not to clap.

1150
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,086
Maybe they were wrong too.

1151
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,509
So lots of people are wrong?

1152
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:42,921
Lots doesn't make it right.

1153
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:45,512
Dad, sorry to break it to you but...

1154
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:49,436
I mean it's not...

1155
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:53,181
You're not David Bowie.

1156
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:56,146
You never were and never will be.

1157
01:16:57,905 --> 01:17:01,023
I'm sad you don't see
glory isn't around the corner.

1158
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,317
It never was and never will be.

1159
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,779
You understand?

1160
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:21,255
Maybe so, but I hold onto my dreams.

1161
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:25,217
Holding onto your dreams is important.

1162
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:26,848
That's your dream?

1163
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:31,061
Your concerts?

1164
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:32,516
Your RV?

1165
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:36,266
Autographs for people
who don't know you?

1166
01:17:36,443 --> 01:17:37,684
That's your dream?

1167
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:47,410
Remember dancing on my shoulders?

1168
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:49,825
Sure. Why bring that up now?

1169
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,040
No reason.

1170
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:53,784
Because it was fun.

1171
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:56,336
It was when I was little.

1172
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:58,380
Way back when.

1173
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:19,935
Seriously, we're doing good.

1174
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:21,523
Don't you think?

01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,233
We're doing good, sure.

1176
01:18:24,325 --> 01:18:26,317
Your drama class? Enjoying it?

1177
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:27,535
Totally.

1178
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,422
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8!

01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:55,178
C'mon, keep going!

1180

Energy, guys!

1181
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:02,985
I hate her.

1182
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:04,236
I detest her.

1183
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:18,789
It'll be alright, buddy.
We can do this.

1184
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:27,095
Ok?

1185
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:28,304
No.

1186
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:34,976
I'm going to kill her.

1187
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,687
- Too fast!
- Come again?

1188
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:39,222
It's too fast!

1189
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:40,648
Shut your big mouth!

1190
01:19:40,818 --> 01:19:42,400
It's impossible, too hard.

Open it when you're not shit anymore!
What are you doing?

1192
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:49,570
I'm ashamed! Look at you!

1193
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:52,360
I'm sick of coaching
worthless pieces of shit!

1194
01:19:52,579 --> 01:19:55,538
You're useless! Why do I bother?

1195
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:57,115
I don't believe this!

1196
01:19:57,418 --> 01:19:59,205
Laurent, back in the water!

1197
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,416
You're shit! Useless pieces of shit!

1198
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:05,674
It's the last time!
I bust my ass for you for weeks!

1199
01:20:05,843 --> 01:20:06,924
For nothing!

1200
01:20:11,098 --> 01:20:12,098

Shit!

1203

I'm doing it for you.

01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:26,404
I know.

I'm sorry, it was on impulse.

If I were you guys,
I'd do so fucking much!

1209
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:42,210
- Better?
- Fine, thanks.

1210
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:46,835
I apologize again, I'm really sorry.

1211
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:48,167
It's already forgotten.

1212
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:50,506
- You had to let it out.
- Yes, sorry.

1213
01:20:51,347 --> 01:20:52,383
Now rest up.

1214
01:20:55,309 --> 01:20:57,801
Miss Ironside will dial it down now.

1215
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:02,980
Two hours, you tubby bastards!

1216
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:04,482
Two hours in the sauna!

1217
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,104

Amanda!

1220

It was an accident!

1221
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:14,786
Shut it!

1222
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:20,164
Let's lay a trap for her.

1223
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:23,953
We'll dig a hole and lure her into it.

1224
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:26,288
He's right.

1225
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:27,507
Who's in?

1226
01:21:37,351 --> 01:21:38,842
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

1227
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,352
It tastes great.

1228

How did it go?

1229
01:21:43,649 --> 01:21:44,649
Great.

1230
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:49,319
At the pool today,
Marcus tried to unscrew Amanda's wheels.

1231
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:51,904
It's going to end badly.

1232
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:53,315
It won't work.

1233
01:22:13,554 --> 01:22:15,511
Are you keeping up back there?

1234

Go, go, go!

1235
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:24,813
Run! Extract your fingers

01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:26,682
7 minutes more!

1237

He can't go on. He can't take any more.

- What the...
- Just a second.

1240
01:22:35,993 --> 01:22:38,201
And they hope to win the Worlds?

1241
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:39,744
I'm done, enough.

1242
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:41,700
I can do nothing for them.

1243
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:44,790
You have to talk to them.

1244
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:46,834
- Talk to them?
- Yes.

1245
01:22:47,004 --> 01:22:48,211
About what?

1246
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:51,668
Just talk.

Zero customers!

So I stay seated.

1293
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:30,948
Surely it's more annoying
to have zero customers

1294
01:27:31,121 --> 01:27:33,113
than to know I'm on the couch.

1295

Never could.

But you weren't so cocky then.

Fair enough, we don't like each other,

Why shouldn't I tell you?

1310

One hell of a douchebag
married to one hell of a shitbag.

1311
01:28:34,935 --> 01:28:37,097
You're right, that feels so good.

- Outside?
- Yup.

01:29:10,512 --> 01:29:12,094

1321
01:29:19,229 --> 01:29:21,846
- You called him a douchebag?
- I certainly did.

1322
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:24,106
They're family, Bertrand, see?

1323
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:25,517
A family of douchebags.

1324
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:28,812
- You embarrass me.
- How come?

1325
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:31,109
By speaking my mind at last?

1326
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:33,733
By breathing again?

1327
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:38,329
Or by being a laughing stock
for swimming in a pool?

1328
01:29:38,665 --> 01:29:41,032
You don't swim, you sink. Admit it.

1329
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,701
So subtle. "You don't swim, you sink!"

1330
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:51,125
And you got your ass kicked.

1331
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,961
I was on top at the start.

1332
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:12,656
Well...

1333
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:22,282
The buds are out.
A cold snap and they're ruined.

1334
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:28,130
Well...

1335
01:30:31,134 --> 01:30:32,295
I'll be going.

1336
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:36,049
You're not going to wish me luck?

1337
01:30:36,222 --> 01:30:37,554
Say something, Claire.

1338
01:30:40,977 --> 01:30:44,516
Remember, that bitch called the cops
to our daughter's birthday.

1339
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:47,015
Did I hear him insult me?

1340
01:30:47,233 --> 01:30:48,394
Absolutely not.

1341
01:30:48,777 --> 01:30:51,110
And sued us over an apple tree.

1342
01:31:02,666 --> 01:31:04,328
He's here, gotta go.

1343
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:15,302
Hi, Lola.

1344
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:17,302
Hi, Lola.

1345
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:18,553
Surprise!

1346
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:04,092
See those twin peaks?

1347
01:32:04,269 --> 01:32:06,181
Well, according to the guide...

1348
01:32:06,646 --> 01:32:09,980
"The peaks represent the breasts
of the mammary goddess.

1349
01:32:10,233 --> 01:32:11,895
"Norwegians love snacking.

1350
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:14,276
"They are particularly fond of sausages,

1351
01:32:14,446 --> 01:32:17,610
"rolled in pancakes,
and sold at newsstands."

1352
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:19,903
"You can buy a newspaper
without a sausage,

1353
01:32:20,076 --> 01:32:22,659
"but not a sausage without a newspaper."

1354
01:32:40,013 --> 01:32:41,675
Let's start with the basics.

1355
01:32:43,099 --> 01:32:45,011
"Hello" is Hei.

1356
01:32:47,187 --> 01:32:48,894
"How are you?" is...

1357
01:32:57,363 --> 01:32:58,774
Should I write it down?

1358
01:32:58,948 --> 01:33:01,611
"I am delighted to be in your country."

1359
01:33:01,785 --> 01:33:04,402
You're a pain
with your Norwegian lesson.

1360
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:06,866
- We're not at school now.
- That's irrelevant.

1361
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:08,869
It's about making an effort.

1362
01:33:09,042 --> 01:33:10,999
If you don't like it, suck it up!

1363
01:33:11,169 --> 01:33:12,205
Yeah, zip it!

1364
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:13,627
Keep going.

1365
01:33:14,339 --> 01:33:15,705
If nobody gives a shit...

1366
01:33:17,926 --> 01:33:21,215
Not one shit!
Your wife bailed 'cause you're a pain!

1367
01:33:22,055 --> 01:33:23,546
- No, my friend.
- That's low!

1368
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:24,759
I didn't say that.

1369
01:33:24,974 --> 01:33:26,055
Yes, you did!

1370
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:27,851
It slipped out.

1371
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:47,744
Try to get some sleep, Thierry.

1372
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:50,622
I'd love to, but I'm way too excited.

1373
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:52,454
So stay awake in silence.

1374
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:53,913
I can't sleep either.

1375
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:56,541
How about a beer?

1376
01:33:56,798 --> 01:33:57,834
I'd love a beer.

1377
01:33:58,007 --> 01:33:59,007
No!

1378
01:33:59,509 --> 01:34:01,341
Sleep! Not a peep out of you!

1379
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:05,758
- Shut up! Tomorrow's the Worlds.
- It's no reason to...

1380
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:07,715
Watch out, I'll get up!

1381
01:34:08,226 --> 01:34:09,637
She said, I'll get up!

1382
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:16,565
It makes you laugh?

1383
01:34:16,734 --> 01:34:17,815
Sure, it's funny.

1384
01:34:25,326 --> 01:34:26,442
Stop it!

1385
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:27,951
Sorry.

1386
01:34:28,538 --> 01:34:30,154
I feel an attack coming on.

1387
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:31,572
What kind of attack?

1388
01:34:33,543 --> 01:34:34,954
Are they all natural?

1389
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:37,754
Cut it out!

1390
01:34:39,799 --> 01:34:42,212
- You complete idiot!
- Sure, I'm the idiot.

1391
01:34:42,468 --> 01:34:44,004
You'll thank me one day.

1392
01:34:44,929 --> 01:34:46,465
You have no idea!

1393
01:34:57,066 --> 01:34:59,274
Move it, we're running late!

1394
01:35:07,785 --> 01:35:10,903
Quit tossing stuff in here.

1395
01:35:13,583 --> 01:35:14,699
Hey.

1396
01:35:16,252 --> 01:35:18,494
- How are you?
- I should be asking you.

1397
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:19,752
I'm just great.

1398
01:35:20,465 --> 01:35:22,548
- You can tell me if...
- I know.

1399
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:24,301
He went?

1400
01:35:24,427 --> 01:35:25,427
Yes.

1401
01:35:25,553 --> 01:35:26,553
Even so?

1402
01:35:26,804 --> 01:35:28,261
After all that happened?

1403
01:35:29,766 --> 01:35:32,759
It's not just selfish,
it's utterly irresponsible.

1404
01:35:33,478 --> 01:35:35,891
Just imagine the rumors about him.

1405
01:35:36,064 --> 01:35:38,226
I don't tell you, to protect you, but...

1406
01:35:39,442 --> 01:35:41,729
It's not very virile. It's odd.

1407
01:35:42,278 --> 01:35:43,278
It puzzles me.

1408
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:44,607
Of course it does.

1409
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:46,321
Some chocolate, kids?

1410
01:35:46,866 --> 01:35:48,027
What do you mean?

1411
01:35:49,369 --> 01:35:52,578
I mean you have a gift
for organizing birthday parties,

1412
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,739
making quiche, choosing napkins...

1413
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:58,375
Not so much for imagining
your husband can't play tennis, say.

1414
01:35:58,753 --> 01:36:00,415
If you want the truth,

1415
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:03,293
your husband has a ball,
but not on the court.

1416
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:07,301
No, in a dungeon with cuffs,
leather thong, and a good whipping.

1417
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:10,008
But I hear his favorite
is getting peed on.

1418
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:12,639
I don't tell you, to protect you,

1419
01:36:12,809 --> 01:36:14,801
but you have no idea of the rumors.

1420
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:19,059
Thing is, you can't take them,
whereas I don't care.

1421
01:36:19,941 --> 01:36:23,184
Maybe my guy isn't very virile,
but I don't judge him.

1422
01:36:23,403 --> 01:36:25,395
He doesn't have to hide and act like

1423
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:26,937
he's someone else.

1424
01:36:28,074 --> 01:36:29,074
Because...

1425
01:36:29,867 --> 01:36:31,278
I'm proud of him.

1426
01:36:31,953 --> 01:36:34,741
Whatever he does, I'm proud.
And he's proud...

1427
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:36,496
We're proud of each other.

1428
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:38,748
Not always but often. And often

1429
01:36:38,918 --> 01:36:40,580
never means never, get it?

1430
01:36:40,753 --> 01:36:42,244
Let's cut to the chase.

1431
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:47,250
Either your pretty Ralph Lauren home
gets a BDSM basement.

1432
01:36:47,844 --> 01:36:51,258
Or you can go screw yourself
and your supermarket gossip.

1433
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:54,511
That's called
giving as good as you get.

1434
01:36:59,564 --> 01:37:00,645
Kids, let's go.

1435
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:02,977
- Where are we going?
- We're going.

1436
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:34,193
What's wrong?

1437
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:35,406
You ok?

1438
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:36,576
Fine.

1439
01:38:37,036 --> 01:38:38,243
Bullshit. What's wrong?

1440
01:38:38,538 --> 01:38:39,619
I'm not fine.

1441
01:38:39,789 --> 01:38:40,905
I'm stressed out!

1442
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:42,493
I hate being judged, ok?

1443
01:38:43,209 --> 01:38:44,541
It's nerves. I'm in bits.

1444
01:38:44,877 --> 01:38:46,618
You idiot, now you tell us?

1445
01:38:46,796 --> 01:38:47,877
You junked my pills!

1446
01:38:48,339 --> 01:38:49,625
Why did you do that?

1447
01:38:49,799 --> 01:38:52,007
Why? I don't know, I thought...

1448
01:38:52,427 --> 01:38:53,543
Complete idiot.

1449
01:38:53,719 --> 01:38:54,755
Now it's my fault?

1450
01:38:54,929 --> 01:38:56,465
Hey, look! Get a grip!

1451
01:38:59,934 --> 01:39:01,391
- Feeling better?
- Same.

1452
01:39:06,774 --> 01:39:07,774
What?

1453
01:39:07,984 --> 01:39:08,599
Nothing.

1454
01:39:08,776 --> 01:39:10,642
- It's too orangey?
- No.

1455
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:11,820
Looks natural?

1456
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:12,946
Sure.

1457
01:39:14,615 --> 01:39:15,822
Self-tanner.

1458
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:20,244
I thought, can't be pasty white
for the Worlds.

1459
01:39:20,413 --> 01:39:21,904
Gotta be presentable.

1460
01:39:22,165 --> 01:39:23,165
We'll

1461
01:39:23,583 --> 01:39:24,869
watch on internet.

1462
01:39:26,586 --> 01:39:28,703
Knock it off, Granny!
Pain in the butt!

1463
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:34,045
Anyway, I wanted to wish you...

1464
01:39:34,886 --> 01:39:36,002
Thanks, son.

1465
01:39:37,555 --> 01:39:38,671
Lots of love.

1466
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:41,302
I understand you feeling sick.

1467
01:39:41,767 --> 01:39:44,885
The fear of the obstacle,
the pressure, of course...

1468
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:46,269
Are you listening?

1469
01:39:46,439 --> 01:39:48,977
Puking is not constructive. Stop it!

1470
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:50,231
What's going on?

1471
01:39:50,401 --> 01:39:52,313
He's sick, won't open the door.

1472
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:54,690
John, open this door now!

1473
01:39:55,031 --> 01:39:56,693
You hear me? Open up!

1474
01:39:56,866 --> 01:39:59,199
We need you. You're the base. Open up!

1475
01:40:02,788 --> 01:40:03,824
I feel terrible.

1476
01:40:04,582 --> 01:40:05,242
Come on!

1477
01:40:05,416 --> 01:40:07,373
We're screwed without him.
Get on it!

1478
01:40:12,006 --> 01:40:13,006
Stop, Thierry!

1479
01:40:14,509 --> 01:40:16,671
You didn't work the artistic enough.

1480
01:40:17,053 --> 01:40:18,840
That's all I ever did.

1481
01:40:19,013 --> 01:40:21,471
Look at the bodies those guys have got!

1482
01:40:22,767 --> 01:40:24,133
Just wait for their score.

1483
01:40:45,081 --> 01:40:46,197
You're trembling?

1484
01:40:46,624 --> 01:40:48,331
Yes, I'm trembling.

1485
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:50,955
You never tremble?

1486
01:40:51,587 --> 01:40:52,623
No.

1487
01:40:52,838 --> 01:40:54,545
Doesn't mean I'm not scared.

1488
01:40:56,509 --> 01:40:58,250
- I'm sorry about...
- Me too.

1489
01:41:02,682 --> 01:41:03,682
Wake up!

1490
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:06,512
We're not here to hide, sonofabitch!

1491
01:41:12,984 --> 01:41:14,225
He's bonkers!

1492
01:41:15,361 --> 01:41:16,818
Calm the fuck down!

1493
01:41:17,405 --> 01:41:19,067
Stop! Both of you!

1494
01:41:24,453 --> 01:41:26,194
Ready? Let's go see the boys.

1495
01:41:26,372 --> 01:41:27,533
Everything ok?

1496
01:41:27,707 --> 01:41:30,791
If they screw up the execution,
it's all over.

1497
01:41:31,002 --> 01:41:31,788
Calm down.

1498
01:41:31,961 --> 01:41:34,203
Juries don't like the French.
Norway doesn't.

1499
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:37,464
- Stop it, please.
- Norway hates France!

1500
01:41:37,633 --> 01:41:39,249
They'd better be good.

1501
01:41:40,261 --> 01:41:41,547
You went easy on them.

1502
01:41:42,013 --> 01:41:44,175
Here. You feel up to being base?

1503
01:41:44,348 --> 01:41:45,348
Sure.

1504
01:41:46,726 --> 01:41:47,726
Guys!

1505
01:41:52,064 --> 01:41:53,064
You first.

1506
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:58,234
We just wanted to say,
we know you're scared.

1507
01:41:58,404 --> 01:42:01,192
So are we but here we are. Ok?

1508
01:42:06,454 --> 01:42:07,911
We also want to say

1509
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:09,158
we love you.

1510
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:12,449
I'd like to say a word!

1511
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:15,920
Friends...

1512
01:42:17,006 --> 01:42:19,714
What we will do tonight

1513
01:42:20,593 --> 01:42:22,209
is not only bigger than us.

1514
01:42:22,762 --> 01:42:26,506
Tonight, it's not ten of us
in that pool, but 69 million.

1515
01:42:26,682 --> 01:42:27,889
Tonight we are

1516
01:42:28,059 --> 01:42:28,845
France!

1517
01:42:29,018 --> 01:42:32,102
Yes, the France we love,
the France of Voltaire.

1518
01:42:32,521 --> 01:42:35,810
The France that goes
from Corsica to Puy-de-Dôme via...

1519
01:42:35,983 --> 01:42:37,099
Charente-Maritime.

1520
01:42:37,276 --> 01:42:38,276
Too long!

1521
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:41,103
I want you to imagine,
maybe one day,

1522
01:42:41,405 --> 01:42:43,692
our grandchildren will look up and say,

1523
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:47,317
Granddad, did you do all that?

1524
01:42:48,287 --> 01:42:49,403
And we'll reply...

1525
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:50,580
Shut up!

1526
01:42:51,832 --> 01:42:52,993
Shut it, Marcus. Let's go!

1527
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:54,167
Yes.

1528
01:43:58,441 --> 01:43:59,648
Guys, in formation!

1529
01:44:00,025 --> 01:44:01,937
- This is it.
- Let's go!

1530
01:44:06,115 --> 01:44:07,447
This is Dad's thing?

1531
01:44:08,576 --> 01:44:09,657
It's crap.

1532
01:44:11,829 --> 01:44:12,829
Classy pool!

1533
01:44:12,955 --> 01:44:16,198
What the hell's going on?
The store's unattended.

1534
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:18,367
- It's Jean-Luc.
- The World Championships.

1535
01:44:18,544 --> 01:44:19,785
He's up next.

1536
01:44:27,011 --> 01:44:29,173
I blew the sound
but nailed the lights!

1537
01:50:48,350 --> 01:50:49,431
Pull over.

1538
01:50:51,562 --> 01:50:52,928
Pull over there.

1539
01:52:46,885 --> 01:52:48,126
There's nothing.

1540
01:52:48,971 --> 01:52:49,971
Here neither.

1541
01:52:50,389 --> 01:52:51,389
Obviously.

1542
01:52:51,682 --> 01:52:53,548
Tomorrow. Wait till tomorrow.

1543
01:52:54,101 --> 01:52:55,967
For the news to filter through.

1544
01:52:57,354 --> 01:52:59,220
Definitely tomorrow.

1545
01:53:00,524 --> 01:53:01,560
For sure.

1546
01:53:10,909 --> 01:53:11,909
Daddy!

1547
01:53:15,956 --> 01:53:16,956
Gold medal!

1548
01:53:20,377 --> 01:53:22,039
- Beat it, kids.
- Where?

1549
01:53:22,212 --> 01:53:25,501
Who cares! Play on the freeway,
score crack, just beat it.

1550
01:53:25,674 --> 01:53:26,881
Leave us alone.

1551
01:53:27,092 --> 01:53:27,752
Scram!

1552
01:53:27,926 --> 01:53:28,926
Let's go.

1553
01:55:35,846 --> 01:55:38,463
<i>Naturally, for a moment,
one fleeting moment,</i>

1554
01:55:38,974 --> 01:55:41,182
<i>they dreamed of being national heroes.</i>

1555
01:55:41,351 --> 01:55:44,264
<i>Most likely, they will never receive
due recognition.</i>

1556
01:55:45,355 --> 01:55:48,223
<i>It seems unlikely
their story will become a model,</i>

1557
01:55:48,817 --> 01:55:50,228
<i>with a single exception.</i>

1558
01:55:50,402 --> 01:55:51,688
<i>One thing is now certain,</i>

1559
01:55:52,279 --> 01:55:55,738
<i>and the most skeptical
will never call it into question...</i>

1560
01:55:55,907 --> 01:55:57,614
<i>If the desire is there,</i>

1561
01:55:57,784 --> 01:56:00,527
<i>a round peg
will fit in a square hole.</i>

1562
01:56:01,788 --> 01:56:03,074
<i>And vice-versa.</i>
