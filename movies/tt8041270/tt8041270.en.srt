00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,786
<i>Dinosaurs are in our world.</i>

4
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:27,183
<i>And with every confrontation,</i>
<i>we learn more</i>

5
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:28,989
<i>about this frightening</i>
<i>new reality.</i>

6
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,328
<i>How did we get here?</i>

7
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:34,895
Oh, my God.

8
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,427
<i>It's been three decades</i>

9
00:01:36,452 --> 00:01:38,310
<i>since the deadly events</i>
<i>at Jurassic Park,</i>

10
00:01:38,335 --> 00:01:40,668
<i>and we've yet to find a way</i>
<i>for these animals</i>

11
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,450
<i>to live safely among us.</i>

12
00:01:42,475 --> 00:01:43,938
<i>After the devastating eruption</i>

13
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:46,394
<i>of Isla Nublar's</i>
<i>long-dormant volcano,</i>

14
00:01:46,419 --> 00:01:49,710
<i>those who survived were</i>
<i>transported to the mainland.</i>

15
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:52,380
Many of the larger predators
were captured,

16
00:01:52,414 --> 00:01:54,815
but the remaining creatures
scattered here

17
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:57,285
in Big Rock National Park.

18
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,321
While most remained in the wild,

19
00:01:59,354 --> 00:02:01,056
<i>those who made their way</i>
<i>to civilization</i>

20
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:03,391
<i>struggled to adapt</i>
<i>to unfamiliar conditions.</i>

21
00:02:03,425 --> 00:02:07,429
<i>Local authorities have warned</i>
<i>the animals are unpredictable</i>

22
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:10,698
<i>and, when hungry,</i>
<i>extremely violent.</i>

23
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,268
<i>As the dinosaurs spread</i>
<i>across borders,</i>

24
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:15,403
<i>-a global black market has</i>
<i>risen.</i> -MAN: They're not ours.

25
00:02:15,437 --> 00:02:18,240
Go on, you sad, pathetic loser!

26
00:02:18,273 --> 00:02:21,176
<i>To combat the growing</i>
<i>threat of illegal poachers,</i>

27
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,844
<i>the U.S. Congress awarded</i>
<i>sole collection rights</i>

28
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:27,048
<i>to the global giant</i>
<i>Biosyn Genetics.</i>

29
00:02:27,082 --> 00:02:29,850
At Biosyn, we're dedicated
to the idea

30
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:33,954
that dinosaurs can teach us
more about ourselves.

31
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:37,825
<i>CEO Lewis Dodgson</i>
<i>has created a sanctuary</i>

32
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:40,761
<i>in Italy's Dolomite Mountains,</i>
<i>where he hopes to study</i>

33
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:42,808
<i>the dinosaurs'</i>
<i>ancient immune systems</i>

34
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,167
<i>for unique</i>
<i>pharmaceutical properties.</i>

35
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,027
<i>While Biosyn believes</i>
<i>we can handle</i>

36
00:02:47,052 --> 00:02:50,188
<i>genetic power responsibly,</i>
<i>the public remains skeptical.</i>

37
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:53,306
<i>Some note that these</i>
<i>government contracts have led</i>

38
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,378
to massive spikes
in Biosyn's profits.

39
00:02:56,411 --> 00:02:58,913
And rumors persist
of a human clone

40
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:02,750
who mysteriously disappeared,
leading to a worldwide search.

41
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,852
<i>Some believe she's</i>
<i>genetically identical</i>

42
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:07,124
<i>to Charlotte Lockwood,</i>
<i>deceased daughter</i>

43
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:10,025
<i>of Jurassic Park cofounder</i>
<i>Benjamin Lockwood.</i>

44
00:03:10,058 --> 00:03:13,228
<i>Now that we've brought these</i>
<i>animals back from extinction...</i>

45
00:03:15,713 --> 00:03:17,682
<i>Are we responsible for them?</i>

46
00:03:17,707 --> 00:03:20,001
<i>Or should they be left</i>
<i>to fend for themselves?</i>

47
00:03:20,035 --> 00:03:23,205
<i>As we adapt to</i>
<i>an ever-changing world,</i>

48
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:25,906
<i>we must find answers</i>
<i>to these questions--</i>

49
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,144
<i>for their safety</i>
<i>as well as for our own.</i>

50
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:13,954
We are inside
the illegal breeding facility.

51
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:18,159
The juveniles are kept in cages
to keep costs down.

52
00:04:18,193 --> 00:04:20,395
It's medieval.

53
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:25,899
:
Claire.

54
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,307
Why do you think
he's separated from the rest?

55
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:36,977
I don't think
he's gonna make it.

56
00:04:41,383 --> 00:04:43,285
No. What are you doing?

57
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:44,486
We can report this.

58
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:47,222
The DFW takes days
to investigate.

59
00:04:47,255 --> 00:04:49,557
We can save this one now.

60
00:04:51,026 --> 00:04:52,327
It's okay. It's okay, buddy.

61
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,198
-Okay. Here we go.

62
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:03,571
Nope. No!

63
00:05:03,605 --> 00:05:05,906
Lift.

64
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,076
-Support the head.
-Yeah.

65
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:09,244
Okay. Yeah.

66
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:15,183
Okay, come on.
Come on, let's go.

67
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:22,257
-Hold on.
-To what?

68
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:48,483
Claire, we're gonna get shot!

69
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,956
-No. Claire, no! No, Claire!
-Oh, no!

70
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,135
Oh, shit.

71
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:11,972
Everybody good?

72
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:14,008
No!

73
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:27,589
Okay. Okay, so I think
we get this one to the DFW,

74
00:06:27,622 --> 00:06:29,290
and then we hit them again.

75
00:06:29,324 --> 00:06:32,193
Yeah. Yeah, you saw
that breeding ground, right?

76
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:34,028
We're done.

77
00:06:35,697 --> 00:06:37,265
I got a call last week.

78
00:06:37,298 --> 00:06:38,366
It's a real job.

79
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,968
Something I could do
to effectively change things.

80
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:43,104
-I got to take it.
-They need us.

81
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:45,407
Are you saving these dinosaurs
because they need us,

82
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,268
or are you saying them
to absolve yourself?

83
00:06:48,293 --> 00:06:49,541
Claire.

84
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:51,246
I mean, this is crazy. We...

85
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,647
Claire.

86
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,596
You're doing the right thing.

87
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:58,238
But this... this isn't the way
to go about it anymore.

88
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,721
Honestly, you need someone

89
00:07:00,746 --> 00:07:02,448
who's good at being shot at.

90
00:07:02,473 --> 00:07:05,460
Aren't-aren't you and Owen
still, like, a weird thing?

91
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:07,028
It's not that weird.

92
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:09,564
-He didn't mean weird. No.
-Mm-mm.

93
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:12,200
Uh, he meant, like, surprising.

94
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:34,088
Hyah!

95
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:53,341
Let's bring 'em home! Hyah!

96
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:16,464
Hyah!

97
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,425
No.

98
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,540
Okay. Come here.

99
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:04,279
Okay.

100
00:09:16,391 --> 00:09:19,127
We're gonna get you
someplace safe.

101
00:09:22,463 --> 00:09:24,198
Hey.

102
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:31,172
There you go. There you go.

103
00:09:31,873 --> 00:09:33,408
Yeah.

104
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:32,253
Hey.

105
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:35,757
Where you been?

106
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,891
Nowhere.

107
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:39,360
What are you burning?

108
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:42,764
Oh, nothing.
Just some old blankets.

109
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:46,367
You sure you didn't
go past the bridge?

110
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,369
That's the look you give me
when you think I'm lying.

111
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:50,505
-Well, are you?
-No.

112
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:52,573
Maisie, you're literally
looking everywhere but here.

113
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,077
I said I didn't
go past the bridge.

114
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,581
Maisie.

115
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:02,817
-Can we start over?
-I know, Claire.

116
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,786
There are people out there
who'll do anything to find me.

117
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:06,454
I'm not angry.

118
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:08,322
So that means
you don't have to be angry.

119
00:13:08,356 --> 00:13:09,672
I'm not angry.

120
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:11,663
I can take care of myself.

121
00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:13,061
Hey.

122
00:13:13,095 --> 00:13:15,696
It's okay for us
to depend on each other.

123
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,438
That's what people do.

124
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,532
How would I know what people do?

125
00:13:19,557 --> 00:13:22,493
The only people I've spoken to
in the past four years

126
00:13:22,518 --> 00:13:24,553
are you both.

127
00:13:24,705 --> 00:13:27,842
Besides, I'm not even
a real person anyway.

128
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:28,876
What?

129
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,079
I was made from someone else.

130
00:13:31,113 --> 00:13:33,681
I'm not me.

131
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,141
You're the only you
who ever was.

132
00:13:44,692 --> 00:13:45,893
What?

133
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:47,495
No.

134
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:49,031
Was that, like, really corny?

135
00:13:49,064 --> 00:13:50,364
It was so corny.

136
00:13:50,398 --> 00:13:51,732
Can we keep that between us?

137
00:13:51,766 --> 00:13:53,068
Can't promise that.

138
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:01,109
-Hey, kid.
-Hi.

139
00:14:01,143 --> 00:14:02,777
Sorry I'm late.

140
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,079
Bop, bop.

141
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:06,480
Aw.

142
00:14:06,514 --> 00:14:07,915
You smell like horses.

143
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:09,051
Mm.

144
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:10,518
Oh, you like that, do you?

145
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:11,819
-I do, yeah.
-Aw.

146
00:14:11,853 --> 00:14:12,887
Okay.

147
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,522
Um...

148
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:17,125
I'm gonna... make dinner.

149
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,993
-Everything okay?

150
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:22,630
She went into town again.

151
00:14:23,898 --> 00:14:25,499
This kid.

152
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:27,406
Did you talk to her?

153
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:29,266
I tried.

154
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:32,473
I'll talk to her.

155
00:16:11,806 --> 00:16:13,208
All right.

156
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:15,843
Cut away from yourself.

157
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:21,049
Whoa.

158
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,184
Whew.

159
00:16:22,217 --> 00:16:24,252
-Stone-cold.
-Right?

160
00:16:24,286 --> 00:16:26,088
I would not mess with her.

161
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:27,888
No way.

162
00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:34,962
Listen, kiddo,
we should probably talk

163
00:16:34,996 --> 00:16:36,064
about you going into town.

164
00:16:37,232 --> 00:16:38,599
I don't think you understand

165
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:39,900
how bad it is
being trapped here.

166
00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:41,535
You're not trapped here.

167
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:43,005
We just don't trust people.

168
00:16:43,038 --> 00:16:44,572
No, you just don't trust me.

169
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:46,907
And then you expect me
to trust you.

170
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:49,744
-Why can't I have any freedom?
-Because you can't.

171
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:56,884
That went great.

172
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:58,652
What is happening?

173
00:16:59,254 --> 00:17:01,256
-She's 14.
-Yeah.

174
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:03,624
You remember what that was like.

175
00:17:04,226 --> 00:17:06,028
I do.

176
00:17:07,095 --> 00:17:09,031
We can't keep her here forever.

177
00:17:09,064 --> 00:17:10,698
If we don't figure this out,

178
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:12,633
she's gonna go a lot farther
than the bridge.

179
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,336
If they find her, we're never
gonna see her again.

180
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,038
We got to protect her.
That's our job.

181
00:17:16,071 --> 00:17:17,272
That's what we're gonna do.

182
00:17:17,305 --> 00:17:19,041
Protect her how?

183
00:17:19,074 --> 00:17:21,076
By locking her inside?

184
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:24,612
<i>She's got questions.</i>

185
00:17:25,313 --> 00:17:27,581
<i>You know,</i>
<i>questions we can't answer.</i>

186
00:17:29,217 --> 00:17:31,119
<i>She wants to know who she is.</i>

187
00:17:33,854 --> 00:17:36,957
<i>Who Charlotte Lockwood was.</i>

188
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:43,864
Tracked Grady to his house.

189
00:17:43,898 --> 00:17:48,170
You were right--
the raptor's got a juvenile.

190
00:17:49,104 --> 00:17:51,705
But listen,
there's something else.

191
00:17:52,374 --> 00:17:54,842
I found that girl
you've been after.

192
00:18:09,224 --> 00:18:10,925
Here you go.

193
00:19:23,265 --> 00:19:24,698
Thanks for coming.

194
00:19:24,732 --> 00:19:27,035
Wasn't sure who to call.

195
00:19:27,068 --> 00:19:29,104
Fish and Wildlife
didn't even want to see it

196
00:19:29,137 --> 00:19:30,472
if it wasn't a dinosaur.

197
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:32,773
Yeah, well,
they get all the attention.

198
00:19:32,806 --> 00:19:34,442
You guys want to vary
the sampling plots

199
00:19:34,476 --> 00:19:35,910
a hundred yards each?

200
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:38,346
-These your students?
-Yeah.

201
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,947
We've been looking
into the impact

202
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,184
of industrial farming
on the environment,

203
00:19:42,217 --> 00:19:44,452
so this is right up our alley.

204
00:19:44,486 --> 00:19:47,355
They hit 60 fields
in the county.

205
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:49,391
Have you seen anything
like this before?

206
00:19:49,424 --> 00:19:51,359
No. Not like this.

207
00:19:51,393 --> 00:19:54,795
They've been leaving degraded
fields all across the Midwest.

208
00:19:54,828 --> 00:19:58,200
First, these big companies
try to kill off all the insects.

209
00:19:58,233 --> 00:20:00,168
Now this.

210
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:11,479
Is that your land?

211
00:20:11,513 --> 00:20:12,947
That's the Bennetts' corn.

212
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,216
The locusts didn't eat that.

213
00:20:14,249 --> 00:20:16,984
You plant the same seed
as the Bennetts?

214
00:20:17,018 --> 00:20:18,420
No.

215
00:20:18,453 --> 00:20:20,721
We are independent.

216
00:20:21,489 --> 00:20:23,891
They use Biosyn seed.

217
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:27,962
Yeah, I bet they do.

218
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:30,831
You say you caught a live one?

219
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:42,743
Okay. Let her down slow.

220
00:20:43,578 --> 00:20:47,048
-Got it?
-Yeah. Easy.

221
00:20:53,388 --> 00:20:55,123
Why do we dig?

222
00:20:55,156 --> 00:20:58,393
'Cause paleontology is science,

223
00:20:58,426 --> 00:21:00,995
and science is about the truth,

224
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:03,198
and there is truth
in these rocks.

225
00:21:03,231 --> 00:21:04,765
Grant!

226
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:08,403
You're gonna want to see this.

227
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:22,350
Ellie Sattler.

228
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:25,886
Alan Grant.

229
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,589
You look the same.

230
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:29,591
-Oh.

231
00:21:29,624 --> 00:21:32,960
And this place-- it's so...

232
00:21:33,595 --> 00:21:36,031
...so, uh, you.

233
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:39,034
I'm sorry, I...

234
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:41,269
If I'd known you were coming,
I would've...

235
00:21:43,238 --> 00:21:44,272
Uh...

236
00:21:47,142 --> 00:21:49,144
Can I get you something?
A beer or...

237
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:52,314
Um, well, maybe not
at 10:00 a.m.

238
00:21:52,347 --> 00:21:54,215
:
But iced tea or...

239
00:21:54,249 --> 00:21:55,617
Tea. Yeah.

240
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,285
Tea. I can do that.

241
00:21:58,653 --> 00:22:01,089
Saw a lot of tourists
on the way in.

242
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:04,225
Well, the funding's dried up,
so...

243
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:06,194
somebody's got to pay
for all this.

244
00:22:06,227 --> 00:22:08,829
Right. Thank you.

245
00:22:10,131 --> 00:22:12,567
I read your articles
about soil science

246
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,269
and regenerative farming.

247
00:22:14,302 --> 00:22:16,204
-It was great.
-Thanks.

248
00:22:16,237 --> 00:22:18,872
Gave me grounds for some hope,
for a change.

249
00:22:18,906 --> 00:22:20,275
How are your kids?

250
00:22:20,308 --> 00:22:22,177
Mm.

251
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,944
Amazing. Grown.

252
00:22:23,977 --> 00:22:25,946
It's shocking.
They're both in college.

253
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:27,415
Can you believe that?

254
00:22:27,449 --> 00:22:29,150
And Mark?

255
00:22:30,918 --> 00:22:33,121
It's over.

256
00:22:33,154 --> 00:22:35,090
Oh.

257
00:22:36,024 --> 00:22:37,891
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

258
00:22:37,925 --> 00:22:39,427
It's okay.

259
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:41,162
I'm back to me.

260
00:22:41,196 --> 00:22:42,230
My work.

261
00:22:42,263 --> 00:22:44,432
-You know, it's...
-That's great.

262
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:46,234
It's good. It is.

263
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:47,535
I'm alone at last.

264
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:49,070
Exciting times.

265
00:22:49,104 --> 00:22:51,639
Yeah, I'm living
the Alan Grant life.

266
00:22:51,673 --> 00:22:53,475
-It's just...
-Can be lonely.

267
00:22:53,508 --> 00:22:55,176
...so free.

268
00:22:57,645 --> 00:22:59,414
Ellie...

269
00:23:00,482 --> 00:23:05,120
You didn't come out all this way
just to catch up, now, did you?

270
00:23:08,623 --> 00:23:10,525
Well, it's a locust.

271
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:13,661
Mandibles, wings, thorax, but...

272
00:23:13,695 --> 00:23:15,963
God, the size of it is massive.

273
00:23:17,532 --> 00:23:20,568
It has genes that have been
extinct since the Cretaceous,

274
00:23:20,602 --> 00:23:22,704
and swarms of them
are decimating crops

275
00:23:22,737 --> 00:23:24,472
from Iowa to Texas.

276
00:23:24,506 --> 00:23:26,508
Terrifying, right?

277
00:23:27,475 --> 00:23:29,110
Started as a few hundred.

278
00:23:29,144 --> 00:23:31,279
There could be millions
by the end of the summer.

279
00:23:31,312 --> 00:23:32,946
If they keep going,

280
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,617
there will be no grain
to feed chickens, cattle.

281
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,685
The entire food chain
would collapse.

282
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:42,323
Well, it's clearly designed,
but why would anyone do that?

283
00:23:43,224 --> 00:23:47,295
None of the crops they're eating
are Biosyn seed.

284
00:23:47,328 --> 00:23:48,962
Biosyn.

285
00:23:48,996 --> 00:23:50,498
You're saying Biosyn made this.

286
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:52,333
I mean, it would not shock me

287
00:23:52,367 --> 00:23:54,968
that they want to control
the world's food supply.

288
00:23:55,003 --> 00:23:57,439
Not before a few million starve.

289
00:23:57,472 --> 00:23:59,007
Yeah, what is that saying?

290
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,543
Uh, we're three meals away
from anarchy?

291
00:24:01,576 --> 00:24:05,547
If we don't stop them, you can
pick your last three meals.

292
00:24:07,048 --> 00:24:09,083
So why are you
bringing it to me?

293
00:24:09,117 --> 00:24:10,752
I need concrete evidence

294
00:24:10,785 --> 00:24:13,021
Biosyn's responsible
for all this.

295
00:24:13,054 --> 00:24:14,656
I need to go to their sanctuary

296
00:24:14,689 --> 00:24:17,358
and get DNA
from another locust there.

297
00:24:18,626 --> 00:24:21,396
But I need a witness.

298
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:22,564
Alan.

299
00:24:23,465 --> 00:24:25,700
You command respect.
People believe you.

300
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:27,735
:
Ellie.

301
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:29,671
You know why I'm here?
It's quiet.

302
00:24:29,704 --> 00:24:31,206
I'm done with all that.

303
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:33,374
Are you? Okay.

304
00:24:33,408 --> 00:24:35,109
Well, I'm sorry, Alan.

305
00:24:35,143 --> 00:24:37,278
Nobody gets that luxury anymore.

306
00:24:37,312 --> 00:24:38,680
Not even you.

307
00:24:38,713 --> 00:24:40,682
And you know what?

308
00:24:40,715 --> 00:24:42,484
You're the one I trust.

309
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:50,625
This Biosyn sanctuary is what,
a hundred miles from anywhere?

310
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:52,360
How do you even get in there?

311
00:24:52,393 --> 00:24:53,728
I got an invite.

312
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:56,231
From their in-house philosopher.

313
00:24:57,065 --> 00:24:58,266
Seems there's a lot of money

314
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:00,301
in being a chaotician
these days.

315
00:25:00,335 --> 00:25:04,038
And he just happened to invite
you out of the blue, huh?

316
00:25:04,772 --> 00:25:06,441
He said there were things
I'd want to see.

317
00:25:06,474 --> 00:25:07,575
Uh-huh.

318
00:25:13,214 --> 00:25:15,183
You coming or what?

319
00:25:30,164 --> 00:25:31,432
Every animal captured
on the mainland

320
00:25:31,466 --> 00:25:33,101
comes through here
before shipping out

321
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:34,335
to Biosyn's sanctuary
in the Dolomites.

322
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:36,204
We give them medical attention

323
00:25:36,237 --> 00:25:38,506
and make sure
they leave healthy.

324
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,542
So much security.

325
00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:42,176
Those are just the ones you see.

326
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,579
A lot of shady types out there
want these guys.

327
00:25:47,115 --> 00:25:48,716
Your plane's just fueling up.

328
00:25:49,717 --> 00:25:52,320
Biosyn's a tough invite.
You guys must know somebody.

329
00:25:52,353 --> 00:25:54,489
-Do you mind if I...?
-Of course.

330
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:57,792
Hello.

331
00:25:57,825 --> 00:25:59,427
You see me?

332
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,695
Follow me.

333
00:26:00,728 --> 00:26:02,154
We rescued these guys

334
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:04,566
from an illegal breeding farm
in Nevada a few weeks ago.

335
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:06,734
Shut the whole place down.

336
00:26:06,768 --> 00:26:08,169
Anonymous tip.

337
00:26:08,202 --> 00:26:09,704
:
Good girl.

338
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:11,873
Yes. Yes.

339
00:26:11,906 --> 00:26:13,841
:
Alan.

340
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:16,277
You never get used to it.

341
00:26:16,878 --> 00:26:18,713
-Take care.
-Thank you.

342
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:20,481
-Bye.
-Okay.

343
00:26:56,651 --> 00:26:57,919
Hey.

344
00:26:59,654 --> 00:27:02,156
You look just like Blue.

345
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:06,828
-This?

346
00:27:06,861 --> 00:27:09,197
You want to try it?

347
00:27:09,797 --> 00:27:11,265
Okay.

348
00:27:19,407 --> 00:27:20,675
Huh.

349
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:26,681
Maisie, don't move.

350
00:27:30,551 --> 00:27:31,653
Hey, girl.

351
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,888
Staying out of trouble?

352
00:27:33,921 --> 00:27:36,491
She had a baby.
That's impossible.

353
00:27:38,793 --> 00:27:40,228
Back up.

354
00:27:40,261 --> 00:27:41,929
She won't hurt us, right?

355
00:27:41,963 --> 00:27:43,665
Oh, you're damn right she will.

356
00:27:43,698 --> 00:27:45,233
Just breathe.

357
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:46,901
If you don't,
she'll think you're scared.

358
00:27:46,934 --> 00:27:48,569
-I am scared.

359
00:27:48,603 --> 00:27:51,606
Nah. She doesn't
need to know that.

360
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:00,348
Her nest has got to be nearby.

361
00:28:00,381 --> 00:28:02,684
-Maisie, get inside.
-I'm coming with you.

362
00:28:02,717 --> 00:28:04,285
What did I just say?

363
00:28:13,695 --> 00:28:14,996
We got to move.

364
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,798
Not yet. We need the girl.

365
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:19,967
Hey, what's up?

366
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:21,469
Oh.

367
00:28:24,338 --> 00:28:27,475
Maisie? Maisie.

368
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,581
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

369
00:28:33,614 --> 00:28:34,649
Where are you going?

370
00:28:34,682 --> 00:28:35,817
You can't keep me here.

371
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,351
You're not my mother.

372
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,493
She's leaving the house.

373
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,721
-Tie it down!
-Come on, let's go.

374
00:29:18,693 --> 00:29:20,762
-Let's get out of here!

375
00:29:39,114 --> 00:29:41,282
Who are you?

376
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:03,805
Claire!

377
00:30:04,772 --> 00:30:06,440
-They found her.
-What?

378
00:30:06,474 --> 00:30:07,942
-Who are they?
-Poachers.

379
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:09,510
I've seen 'em around.

380
00:30:09,544 --> 00:30:10,845
Leader's a real shit heel.

381
00:30:10,878 --> 00:30:13,614
He must have recognized me,
followed me here.

382
00:30:13,648 --> 00:30:15,416
-Where is she?
-Go get the truck.

383
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:17,318
Oh, my God.

384
00:30:19,787 --> 00:30:21,422
Oh, God.

385
00:30:23,091 --> 00:30:25,093
-Owen.

386
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:26,994
Hey. No.

387
00:30:30,965 --> 00:30:32,800
They took her kid, too.

388
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:39,041
I am gonna get her back.

389
00:30:39,074 --> 00:30:40,908
I promise you that.

390
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:52,453
Come on.

391
00:30:52,486 --> 00:30:54,089
I know who to call.

392
00:31:08,836 --> 00:31:11,606
No! Please, please! No, no!

393
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,675
This year, man. What's next?

394
00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:18,146
Historically, uh, darkness,
blood, rain of fire.

395
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,714
I think frogs.

396
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:21,515
We're not gonna be around
for much longer anyway.

397
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:23,051
These locusts in Nebraska
are about to wrap it up.

398
00:31:23,085 --> 00:31:24,652
They're eating the corn, wheat.

399
00:31:24,685 --> 00:31:26,621
Basically all of our food
and our food's food.

400
00:31:26,654 --> 00:31:29,024
So we can say goodbye to this.

401
00:31:31,826 --> 00:31:34,029
-Hello?
Franklin, it's me.

402
00:31:34,062 --> 00:31:35,496
-You at work?
-Okay.

403
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:37,498
You're kind of a subject
of interest around here,

404
00:31:37,531 --> 00:31:39,101
so I can't really
be talking to you.

405
00:31:39,134 --> 00:31:40,434
Come on, I'm in trouble.

406
00:31:40,468 --> 00:31:41,702
I really need your help, please.

407
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:43,504
Yeah, and I could lose my job,

408
00:31:43,537 --> 00:31:45,040
and you know I'm not qualified
to do anything else.

409
00:31:45,073 --> 00:31:46,540
We're outside.

410
00:31:48,743 --> 00:31:50,511
Let me talk to him.

411
00:31:53,915 --> 00:31:54,916
That him?

412
00:31:54,949 --> 00:31:56,184
That's him.

413
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:58,519
Name's Rainn Delacourt.

414
00:31:58,552 --> 00:32:00,088
Real piece of work.

415
00:32:00,122 --> 00:32:01,689
What'd he take?

416
00:32:02,556 --> 00:32:04,859
Something we care about
very much.

417
00:32:04,892 --> 00:32:06,627
Oh, shit.

418
00:32:06,661 --> 00:32:08,529
I told you somebody
would come looking for her.

419
00:32:08,562 --> 00:32:10,232
You can't just take
a person, Claire.

420
00:32:10,265 --> 00:32:12,633
-I had no choice.
-Not in the eyes of the law.

421
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:15,636
This guy is not the law.
Tell us how to find him.

422
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,873
Where'd you guys call me from?

423
00:32:19,874 --> 00:32:22,977
We have a man on the inside
of Delacourt's operation.

424
00:32:23,011 --> 00:32:24,212
There's an exchange in Malta

425
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:25,813
sometime tomorrow--
cash for cargo.

426
00:32:25,846 --> 00:32:27,115
Was she with him?

427
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:31,253
There's no mention, but we have
people on the ground already.

428
00:32:31,286 --> 00:32:32,687
One of 'em you know.

429
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,089
A lot of us got recruited
by the CIA

430
00:32:34,122 --> 00:32:35,690
after the park went down.

431
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:38,859
Barry's French intelligence now.

432
00:32:40,995 --> 00:32:42,097
I need to talk to him.

433
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:44,099
You can't just call him.
He's deep cover.

434
00:32:44,132 --> 00:32:45,866
Look, once we make
the bust in Malta,

435
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,236
our guys will see if Delacourt
knows where she is.

436
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,105
Our guys.

437
00:32:50,138 --> 00:32:51,572
Not you.

438
00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:54,575
Promise me you won't go in there
with your vest

439
00:32:54,608 --> 00:32:56,477
and mess everything up.

440
00:32:57,112 --> 00:32:58,612
Why would I do that?

441
00:32:59,613 --> 00:33:02,817
Look, you guys
are both crazy, but...

442
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,618
you seem like
you're good parents

443
00:33:04,652 --> 00:33:06,288
or whatever you're trying to be.

444
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:08,723
She's lucky to have you.

445
00:33:09,957 --> 00:33:12,560
Don't get killed, okay?

446
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:32,180
Think we're almost there.

447
00:33:32,214 --> 00:33:33,781
Yeah.

448
00:33:47,162 --> 00:33:48,929
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant.

449
00:33:48,963 --> 00:33:50,965
-Ramsay Cole, communications.
-Oh, hey.

450
00:33:50,998 --> 00:33:52,200
Uh, I have to warn you,

451
00:33:52,234 --> 00:33:53,801
everyone's so excited
to have you.

452
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:56,071
You guys are absolute legends
around here.

453
00:33:56,104 --> 00:33:58,906
Mm, you must be confusing us
with somebody else.

454
00:33:58,939 --> 00:34:00,008
You know, it's great

455
00:34:00,042 --> 00:34:02,144
that you guys are still
so close with Dr. Malcolm.

456
00:34:02,177 --> 00:34:05,080
I mean, sometimes you meet your
heroes and they disappoint you,

457
00:34:05,113 --> 00:34:07,581
but he's exactly the way
you'd want him to be.

458
00:34:07,615 --> 00:34:08,816
I mean,
such motility of thought.

459
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:10,185
-It's incredible.
-Yeah.

460
00:34:10,218 --> 00:34:11,852
How much time
have you spent with him?

461
00:34:11,886 --> 00:34:14,622
Uh, well,
I know that was sarcastic,

462
00:34:14,655 --> 00:34:15,990
but honestly, not enough.

463
00:34:16,024 --> 00:34:17,092
Oh, please, after you.

464
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:18,326
-Oh.
-And watch your head.

465
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:27,701
So, Biosyn bought this
land for the amber deposits

466
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:29,670
back in the '90s,
but we've managed to turn it

467
00:34:29,703 --> 00:34:32,007
into a safe haven
for about 20 displaced species.

468
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,009
First generation came
from Sorna.

469
00:34:34,042 --> 00:34:36,011
Most of the Nublar dinosaurs
are here, too.

470
00:34:36,044 --> 00:34:39,114
Took Fish and Wildlife
three years to catch the T. rex.

471
00:34:39,147 --> 00:34:41,682
-The...
-The T. rex is here?

472
00:34:41,715 --> 00:34:44,052
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

473
00:34:44,086 --> 00:34:47,122
:
Arrived just before you guys.

474
00:35:03,771 --> 00:35:06,707
Aerial deterrent system active.

475
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,710
Restricted airspace
protects the airborne life.

476
00:35:09,743 --> 00:35:12,047
Keeps the pterosaurs
below 500 feet.

477
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,614
Airborne?

478
00:35:15,183 --> 00:35:17,252
Is that <i>Dreadnoughtus?</i>

479
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:19,020
What?

480
00:35:26,161 --> 00:35:27,828
Beautiful, right?

481
00:35:27,862 --> 00:35:29,864
The name means "fear nothing."

482
00:35:29,897 --> 00:35:32,267
Well, I guess you know that.

483
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,435
What do they graze on?

484
00:35:33,468 --> 00:35:34,802
Hawthorn and fern.

485
00:35:34,835 --> 00:35:36,371
All indigenous-- nothing stocked

486
00:35:36,404 --> 00:35:38,106
except for the deer population.

487
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,409
It's a great mezzanine species
for the apex predator.

488
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:43,411
-Oh...
-Apex predator?

489
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:46,047
<i>Giganotosaurus.</i>

490
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:48,150
At least for now.

491
00:35:57,459 --> 00:36:00,462
Uh, you don't let people
in there, right?

492
00:36:00,495 --> 00:36:02,897
Uh, no, our-our research...

493
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,798
Our research outposts
are connected

494
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:05,900
completely underground.

495
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:07,435
If we have to, we can just

496
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:10,771
herd the animals remotely
using a neuro-implant

497
00:36:10,804 --> 00:36:13,041
that sends electrical signals
directly to the brain.

498
00:36:13,074 --> 00:36:14,409
Like shocks?

499
00:36:14,442 --> 00:36:17,245
Uh, n-no, li-like signals.

500
00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:20,382
Doesn't it strike you
as a little bit, uh...

501
00:36:20,415 --> 00:36:21,916
-Cruel?
-Cruel.

502
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:23,451
Do you know how much voltage

503
00:36:23,485 --> 00:36:26,221
was in the electric fences
at Jurassic Park?

504
00:36:27,155 --> 00:36:28,156
Yeah.

505
00:36:33,907 --> 00:36:36,097
Please join
Dr. Ian Malcolm at noon

506
00:36:36,122 --> 00:36:38,954
in the lecture hall for
"The Ethics of Genetic Power."

507
00:36:38,979 --> 00:36:40,747
God, everyone's so young.

508
00:36:40,968 --> 00:36:42,736
Oh, well, it is part
of our ethos

509
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,439
to attract the best
and brightest.

510
00:36:44,472 --> 00:36:46,208
Doctors.

511
00:36:46,241 --> 00:36:50,312
Respected, renowned
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant.

512
00:36:50,345 --> 00:36:52,447
Hi. I'm... Wow, this is big.

513
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,848
-I'm-I'm Lewis.
-Dodgson. Yeah.

514
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:56,251
-Hi.
-You're Lewis Dodgson?

515
00:36:56,284 --> 00:36:57,519
I am. How do you do?

516
00:36:57,552 --> 00:36:59,360
We didn't expect
to actually see you here.

517
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:00,988
Oh, well, I wouldn't be
anywhere else.

518
00:37:01,022 --> 00:37:03,225
-Would you?
- No.

519
00:37:03,258 --> 00:37:05,960
I mean, the people you see here
are changing the world.

520
00:37:06,146 --> 00:37:07,515
Would you mind if we, um...

521
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,171
-Uh...
-Oh.

522
00:37:09,196 --> 00:37:11,099
Just to...
It would mean a lot. If...

523
00:37:11,132 --> 00:37:12,534
-Do you want to, um...

524
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:14,302
-Oh, great. Thank you so much.
-Oh, uh...

525
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,239
Th-That's good.
That's good. Thanks.

526
00:37:17,272 --> 00:37:21,942
So, you are going to see
some remarkable things today.

527
00:37:21,976 --> 00:37:25,480
We are unlocking
the true power of the genome.

528
00:37:25,513 --> 00:37:27,249
We're this close. Believe me.

529
00:37:27,282 --> 00:37:29,184
You'll make a fortune with that.

530
00:37:29,217 --> 00:37:31,253
No, it's not about money.

531
00:37:31,286 --> 00:37:32,853
No, we've already identified

532
00:37:32,886 --> 00:37:34,289
dozens of applications
for paleo-DNA.

533
00:37:34,322 --> 00:37:38,293
We're talking about cancer,
Alzheimer's, autoimmune.

534
00:37:38,326 --> 00:37:40,061
We will be saving lives, but...

535
00:37:40,095 --> 00:37:41,862
-I bet.

536
00:37:41,895 --> 00:37:44,266
Um, anyway, I wish I could
take you around myself,

537
00:37:44,299 --> 00:37:46,000
but, uh, it's, uh...

538
00:37:46,034 --> 00:37:49,304
So, you're in more-than-capable
hands with Ramsay.

539
00:37:49,337 --> 00:37:52,407
He's basically a... a young me,

540
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,976
only smarter and, uh, taller...

541
00:37:56,011 --> 00:37:58,879
-Do you have food?

542
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:01,182
-Like, one of my bars?
-Pardon? Um...

543
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,585
No, never mind.
Uh, uh, I'll find something.

544
00:38:03,618 --> 00:38:05,819
So, uh, I want to do
more of this,

545
00:38:05,853 --> 00:38:07,955
um, later on if we, um...

546
00:38:07,988 --> 00:38:09,990
Oh, we booked you a private pod

547
00:38:10,025 --> 00:38:11,825
-for the trip out, so...
-Right.

548
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:13,061
It's beautiful. You'll love it.

549
00:38:13,094 --> 00:38:14,562
Through the caverns
and everything.

550
00:38:14,596 --> 00:38:16,097
Uh, you better hurry.
Malcolm's on.

551
00:38:16,131 --> 00:38:18,400
He's a bit of a contrarian,
but I like him.

552
00:38:18,433 --> 00:38:19,833
He keeps us on our toes.

553
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:21,036
Anyway...

554
00:38:21,069 --> 00:38:23,204
Thank you for being here.
It's...

555
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,076
Okay, um, follow me, please.

556
00:38:29,577 --> 00:38:31,179
What?

557
00:38:31,212 --> 00:38:36,584
Human beings have no more right
to safety or liberty

558
00:38:36,618 --> 00:38:40,055
than any other creature
on this planet.

559
00:38:41,489 --> 00:38:46,328
We not only lack dominion
over nature,

560
00:38:46,361 --> 00:38:48,363
we're subordinate to it.

561
00:38:49,364 --> 00:38:51,066
And now here we are

562
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:54,369
with the opportunity to
rewrite life at our fingertips.

563
00:38:54,402 --> 00:38:57,472
And just like nuclear power,
nobody knew what to expect

564
00:38:57,505 --> 00:39:01,276
with genetic engineering,
but they pressed the button

565
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:04,145
and hoped for the best...

566
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:07,082
just like you are doing now.

567
00:39:08,116 --> 00:39:10,285
Yep. You.

568
00:39:11,419 --> 00:39:16,990
You control the future
of our survival on planet Earth.

569
00:39:17,025 --> 00:39:19,960
According to you,
the solution is genetic power.

570
00:39:19,993 --> 00:39:23,365
But that same power could
devastate the food supply,

571
00:39:23,398 --> 00:39:25,633
create new diseases,

572
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:28,001
alter the climate even further.

573
00:39:28,036 --> 00:39:31,939
Unforeseen consequences occur.

574
00:39:31,972 --> 00:39:37,278
And every time,
every single time...

575
00:39:38,713 --> 00:39:40,981
...we all act surprised?

576
00:39:41,015 --> 00:39:43,951
Because deep down,
I don't think that any of us

577
00:39:43,984 --> 00:39:47,155
actually believe
that these dangers are real.

578
00:39:54,429 --> 00:39:58,133
In order to instigate
revolutionary change,

579
00:39:58,166 --> 00:40:04,272
we must transform
human consciousness.

580
00:40:11,613 --> 00:40:13,047
-Mayam?
-Mm-hmm.

581
00:40:13,081 --> 00:40:14,716
Dr. Malcolm?
-Very good.

582
00:40:14,749 --> 00:40:16,351
There-there you go.

583
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,386
Hey, I don't want to be rude
to my friends. Thank you.

584
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,688
Catch me on my way out.
Thanks, everybody.

585
00:40:20,722 --> 00:40:22,157
Look at you,

586
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:26,094
and look at me, and look at you.

587
00:40:26,127 --> 00:40:27,961
Wow, this is so trippy.

588
00:40:27,995 --> 00:40:30,064
You look like you're doing well.

589
00:40:30,098 --> 00:40:31,433
Well, I got five kids, you know,

590
00:40:31,466 --> 00:40:33,568
whom I adore
more than life itself, so...

591
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:35,136
uh, expenses add up.

592
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,572
You, Alan? Are you... are you...

593
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:39,641
You have any family or...?

594
00:40:39,674 --> 00:40:40,675
No.

595
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:43,144
So, uh, I need to talk to you.

596
00:40:43,178 --> 00:40:44,712
Yeah, I need to talk
to you, too.

597
00:40:44,746 --> 00:40:47,215
-Privately.
-Do you two talk a lot?

598
00:40:47,248 --> 00:40:49,350
-Uh, he slid into my DMs.
-He did what?

599
00:40:49,384 --> 00:40:51,653
-It's urgent, Ian.
-What did you do?

600
00:40:51,686 --> 00:40:53,354
"Seven minutes to midnight"
stuff.

601
00:40:53,388 --> 00:40:55,757
Uh, the Doomsday Clock
might be about out of time,

602
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:58,593
but as they say,
it's always darkest

603
00:40:58,626 --> 00:41:01,396
just before eternal nothingness.

604
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:03,064
What?

605
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:08,069
Locusts,
altered with Cretaceous-era DNA.

606
00:41:08,102 --> 00:41:09,404
Yeah, that's not my field.

607
00:41:09,437 --> 00:41:11,439
Yeah, but if these things
continue to multiply,

608
00:41:11,473 --> 00:41:14,476
we're talking about cascading
system-wide effects, Ian.

609
00:41:14,509 --> 00:41:16,110
Gosh, that's a drag.

610
00:41:16,144 --> 00:41:18,179
What is the matter with you?

611
00:41:18,213 --> 00:41:20,148
Why? Is there something special
you want me to do?

612
00:41:20,181 --> 00:41:21,349
Yeah, how about give a damn?

613
00:41:21,382 --> 00:41:23,051
You know far too much
not to care.

614
00:41:23,084 --> 00:41:26,488
Hey, I-I gave my opinion
robustly for years.

615
00:41:26,521 --> 00:41:28,490
As expected,
the sum of our human endeavors

616
00:41:28,523 --> 00:41:31,759
has led to our annihilation,
and the only play now

617
00:41:31,793 --> 00:41:34,429
is to take the time
that we have left and, uh,

618
00:41:34,462 --> 00:41:36,764
you know, just like
we always do, squander it.

619
00:41:36,798 --> 00:41:40,034
Honestly, Ian, that's bullshit.

620
00:41:40,068 --> 00:41:42,203
Can I offer you guys some joe?

621
00:41:42,237 --> 00:41:46,107
Uh, Tyler, please,
two cappuccinos.

622
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,609
I don't want a cappuccino.

623
00:41:47,642 --> 00:41:49,410
Uh, well, I could do, like,
a cortado or, like, macchiato.

624
00:41:49,444 --> 00:41:51,513
Trust me, it's real tough,
that jet lag.

625
00:41:51,546 --> 00:41:52,647
It's gonna perk you right up.

626
00:41:56,684 --> 00:41:58,820
: The locusts are part
of a larger project

627
00:41:58,853 --> 00:42:00,655
called Hexapod Allies.

628
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:02,190
You're right about their intent.

629
00:42:02,223 --> 00:42:04,459
I started hearing rumors
six weeks ago.

630
00:42:04,492 --> 00:42:06,794
I read your piece on decadence
and put two and two together.

631
00:42:06,828 --> 00:42:08,429
I was not raising my voice.

632
00:42:08,463 --> 00:42:10,131
You're beginning to.
It's crescendoing, isn't it?

633
00:42:10,164 --> 00:42:11,666
:
They're proliferating wildly.

634
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:13,835
They're lasting three, four
times longer than they should.

635
00:42:13,868 --> 00:42:16,204
And all my models
are pointing toward a global

636
00:42:16,237 --> 00:42:17,772
ecological collapse, Ian.

637
00:42:17,805 --> 00:42:19,407
Downstairs, sublevel six.

638
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,543
That's where they keep
the locusts.

639
00:42:21,576 --> 00:42:23,444
Look for a lab marked L4.

640
00:42:23,478 --> 00:42:25,346
But wait, how are we ever
gonna get down there?

641
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,148
-Hey, this looks so silky.

642
00:42:27,181 --> 00:42:28,783
May I touch this blouse,
by any chance?

643
00:42:28,816 --> 00:42:30,418
-Sure.
-You know what it is?

644
00:42:30,451 --> 00:42:32,220
-Don't tell... Don't tell me.
-You won't know it.

645
00:42:32,253 --> 00:42:34,255
This is sustainable bamboo.

646
00:42:34,289 --> 00:42:36,224
-It is sustainable bamboo.
-That's why I said it.

647
00:42:36,257 --> 00:42:37,625
-How did you know that?
-I just know it.

648
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:39,294
-Yeah, it's amazing.
I've got cumin.

649
00:42:39,327 --> 00:42:40,628
-It's very amazing.
-I've got cinnamon.

650
00:42:40,662 --> 00:42:42,330
I've got allspice,
which is not very popular.

651
00:42:42,363 --> 00:42:43,831
-I've got five-spice.
-Doctor.

652
00:42:43,865 --> 00:42:45,166
Um, if you're into
that kind of feel.

653
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,102
-Um, and let's talk milks.
-Yeah.

654
00:42:48,136 --> 00:42:50,171
Okay. Soy milk, yes?

655
00:42:51,506 --> 00:42:54,108
No.
-What just happened?

656
00:42:54,142 --> 00:42:56,077
We're in.

657
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:12,360
Sublevel six. Restricted.

658
00:43:18,232 --> 00:43:20,835
Lewis,
you're not listening to me.

659
00:43:20,868 --> 00:43:22,837
The locusts' prehistoric DNA
has made them

660
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,606
stronger than they should be.

661
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:27,375
They're multiplying like crazy,
and they're not dying.

662
00:43:27,408 --> 00:43:28,876
What part of this
don't you understand?

663
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:30,278
Oh, I do understand.

664
00:43:30,311 --> 00:43:32,180
This is gonna be
a global famine.

665
00:43:32,213 --> 00:43:33,881
Hey, hey, we can't
anticipate everything.

666
00:43:33,915 --> 00:43:36,618
We need to eradicate
the ones we released.

667
00:43:36,651 --> 00:43:38,353
-What?
-All of them.

668
00:43:38,386 --> 00:43:40,655
-No. No. Henry.
-Like... like, yesterday.

669
00:43:40,688 --> 00:43:42,423
We don't want to cause a panic.

670
00:43:42,457 --> 00:43:43,891
We want control.

671
00:43:43,925 --> 00:43:46,394
There is no such thing.

672
00:43:58,439 --> 00:44:01,776
When we're afraid,
what do we do?

673
00:44:01,809 --> 00:44:03,745
What have we done before?

674
00:44:03,778 --> 00:44:06,648
We follow through.

675
00:44:06,681 --> 00:44:08,583
That's what we do.

676
00:44:08,616 --> 00:44:10,284
Right?

677
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,755
Right.

678
00:44:16,557 --> 00:44:17,925
We found the girl.

679
00:44:17,959 --> 00:44:19,661
She's en route.

680
00:44:19,694 --> 00:44:21,729
-Cost me a fortune.
-What?

681
00:44:21,763 --> 00:44:24,365
-Wait, you found her?
-Yeah, found them both.

682
00:44:24,399 --> 00:44:26,801
Her and the little raptor.

683
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:29,370
Blue reproduced all on her own.

684
00:44:30,338 --> 00:44:32,507
Just like you said.
You're so smart, Henry.

685
00:44:34,709 --> 00:44:36,944
That's why this works.

686
00:44:36,978 --> 00:44:39,280
You understand the value
of these creatures.

687
00:44:39,313 --> 00:44:40,815
You always have. I do, too.

688
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:43,251
And we don't stop
because a, what,

689
00:44:43,284 --> 00:44:45,186
little side project went south?

690
00:44:46,554 --> 00:44:50,258
Hey. If they trace
the locusts back to us,

691
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:51,793
they come for the dinosaurs.

692
00:44:51,826 --> 00:44:53,528
All your work gone.

693
00:44:54,495 --> 00:44:57,532
Billions of dollars
in assets gone.

694
00:44:58,633 --> 00:45:01,636
Diamonds with no one
to mine them.

695
00:45:02,537 --> 00:45:04,772
You really think
she's the solution?

696
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:09,844
Okay.

697
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:13,514
Everything involving the girl
goes through me, right?

698
00:45:15,383 --> 00:45:16,884
Is she all right?

699
00:45:16,918 --> 00:45:18,453
She better be.

700
00:45:19,054 --> 00:45:20,555
She's the most valuable

701
00:45:20,588 --> 00:45:22,757
intellectual property
on the planet.

702

703

:
Second plane is incoming.

706
00:45:37,371 --> 00:45:38,740
Who said anything
about a second plane?

707
00:45:38,773 --> 00:45:40,042
We flew them separately.

708
00:45:40,075 --> 00:45:41,509
I'm not taking any chances.

709
00:45:41,542 --> 00:45:43,911
And we'll need payment
before delivery.

710
00:45:43,945 --> 00:45:46,014
I didn't like
what happened last time.

711

Okay. Okay, just...
call me when it's done.

712
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,329
You said I was going
someplace safe.

713
00:46:01,963 --> 00:46:03,065
You are.

714
00:46:10,404 --> 00:46:11,873
Walk to the car.

715
00:46:12,874 --> 00:46:15,543
-No.
-It's not a choice.

716
00:46:28,456 --> 00:46:31,726
50 grand to fly
one little raptor.

717
00:46:31,759 --> 00:46:33,694
Not bad.

718
00:46:38,466 --> 00:46:39,867
What's with the girl?

719
00:46:42,403 --> 00:46:44,705
-Not your problem.

720
00:46:52,446 --> 00:46:54,916
-Pleasure doing business.

We're ready. Let's go.

722

Owen.

723
00:47:12,533 --> 00:47:14,468
-Hi, Claire.
-Mm.

724
00:47:14,502 --> 00:47:17,105
I thought you would've chosen
a quieter line of work.

725
00:47:17,139 --> 00:47:18,973
I tried.
My cousin and I opened a café.

726
00:47:19,007 --> 00:47:20,808
I lasted three weeks.

727
00:47:20,842 --> 00:47:23,578
The way the world is headed,
it's hard to look away.

728

<i>Delacourt was hired</i>
<i>by Soyona Santos,</i>

729
00:47:26,581 --> 00:47:28,583
a broker in
the underground dinosaur trade.

We don't have intel
on his cargo,

but once they make the exchange,

732

we'll see what they know
about your girl.

733
00:47:34,755 --> 00:47:35,690
You can listen in,

734
00:47:35,723 --> 00:47:37,892
but promise me
you will not make contact.

735
00:47:37,925 --> 00:47:39,493
No.

Don't look at anyone.
Don't talk to anyone.

742
00:48:02,917 --> 00:48:04,752
Just try to blend in.

Hey, still flying
for Santos, huh?

744

-You must need money.
-What's it to you?

745

I've got cargo.

Thousand kilos of dinosaur
to Palermo.

747

I give you 2,000.

748
00:49:06,214 --> 00:49:08,849
2,000? How much is there?

749
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:20,128
You lost?

750
00:49:20,162 --> 00:49:21,829
You're American.

751

Listen, I just got here, and...

753
00:49:26,734 --> 00:49:29,904
Oh, no, that was not
an invitation. Here.

754
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,009
Souvenir. Go back to the hotel.

755
00:49:34,042 --> 00:49:36,577
You know, throw some bath salts
in the bath.

756
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,081
This place-- not your vibe.

757
00:49:39,114 --> 00:49:41,083
Wait.

-Look...
-Claire.

759
00:49:43,884 --> 00:49:46,687
Claire, I know this must
feel exotic,

760
00:49:46,721 --> 00:49:48,990
but if you mess with
the wrong person down here,

761
00:49:49,024 --> 00:49:50,092
you disappear.

762

You feel me?

763
00:49:51,226 --> 00:49:54,528
-Good luck, okay?
-Wait.

764
00:49:57,032 --> 00:49:58,699

Sorry. I can't get involved.

No sign of the girl.

781

Alpha team, stand clear.

My people say the raptor
arrived in good condition.

783

You boys didn't cock this up.

784

Whoever they're told.

793
00:51:38,866 --> 00:51:40,701
Laser marks the target,
they attach to the scent,

794
00:51:40,734 --> 00:51:42,104
don't stop till it's dead.

795
00:51:42,137 --> 00:51:43,371
Inescapable.

796
00:51:43,405 --> 00:51:45,739
Those idiots making hybrids
had it all wrong.

797

You can't engineer loyalty.

798
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:49,710
You have to nurture it.

799
00:51:49,743 --> 00:51:52,080
50,000 to fly them to Riyadh.

800

In or out?

801
00:51:54,216 --> 00:51:56,184

00:52:02,756 --> 00:52:04,126
Almost there.

808
00:52:17,771 --> 00:52:18,839
Get on the ground!

809
00:52:18,873 --> 00:52:20,442
Delacourt! Stay with him!

810
00:52:20,475 --> 00:52:21,976
Shit.

811
00:52:23,378 --> 00:52:24,879
Get that truck out of here!

812
00:52:32,786 --> 00:52:34,289
We lost Delacourt!

813
00:52:46,368 --> 00:52:48,036
This is Bravo One.

814
00:52:48,069 --> 00:52:50,005
Truck is approaching
the underpass.

815
00:54:03,877 --> 00:54:05,513
-Come on!

816
00:54:20,428 --> 00:54:21,829
The girl, where is she?

817
00:54:21,862 --> 00:54:23,531
-Where did they take her?
-Get it off!

818
00:54:23,565 --> 00:54:25,400
-Where is she?
-I don't know!

819
00:54:25,433 --> 00:54:27,202
We handed her off to Santos.

820
00:54:27,235 --> 00:54:29,504
I don't know where
they took her after that.

821
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:44,185
Claire, it's Santos.

822
00:54:44,219 --> 00:54:46,087
-The woman in white.
-I'll find her.

823
00:54:46,121 --> 00:54:48,922
-Bravo team, watch your six.

824
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:52,160
Hey, hey!

825
00:54:52,193 --> 00:54:54,095
-Hey!
-Hold it!

826
00:54:54,129 --> 00:54:55,996
Let them out.

827
00:54:56,031 --> 00:54:56,830
What?!

828
00:54:56,864 --> 00:54:58,966
You heard me.

829
00:55:23,491 --> 00:55:25,327
Merde.

830
00:55:42,976 --> 00:55:45,013
Claire, do you have her?

831
00:55:58,393 --> 00:55:59,893
We had some trouble.

832
00:55:59,927 --> 00:56:01,629
-What kind?
-The parents.

833
00:56:01,663 --> 00:56:03,665
Grady and Dearing--
they're here.

834
00:56:07,635 --> 00:56:09,237
Can you take care of it?

835
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:10,938
Not for free.

836
00:56:10,971 --> 00:56:13,108
Well, do it.

837
00:56:20,981 --> 00:56:23,917
-: Mama.

838
00:56:27,555 --> 00:56:29,357
Okay, okay, listen.

839
00:56:29,391 --> 00:56:30,991
No, no, no.

840
00:56:44,072 --> 00:56:46,007
You don't use it on people.

841
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,142
Where's my daughter?

842
00:56:47,175 --> 00:56:49,544
She wasn't yours to begin with.

843
00:56:51,546 --> 00:56:53,415
Tell me.

844
00:56:54,616 --> 00:56:56,151
Biosyn.

845
00:56:56,184 --> 00:56:59,320
They're taking her to Biosyn.

846
00:57:04,592 --> 00:57:06,628
You missed her.

847
00:57:06,661 --> 00:57:08,229
She's gone.

848
00:58:00,081 --> 00:58:01,649
-Take my hand. Come on.

849
00:58:32,447 --> 00:58:33,781
Hold on tight.

850
00:58:33,815 --> 00:58:35,583
-What?

851
00:58:45,727 --> 00:58:48,630
Do you remember how we used to
get the raptors in the truck?

852
00:58:48,663 --> 00:58:50,298
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

853
00:58:51,566 --> 00:58:52,834
-You're up.
-No.

854
00:58:54,802 --> 00:58:56,137
At the last minute, dive-roll.

855
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:58,306
-I don't dive-roll.
-You'll be fine.

856
00:58:58,339 --> 00:59:00,508
-I never got the timing right.

857
00:59:01,843 --> 00:59:03,177
Now?

858
00:59:03,211 --> 00:59:05,179
Any minute. Any minute now.

859
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,582
-Now?
-No.

860
00:59:09,717 --> 00:59:11,252
Now!

861
00:59:14,155 --> 00:59:16,624
-Yeah. Yeah!

862
00:59:17,725 --> 00:59:19,093
Freeze.

863
00:59:26,301 --> 00:59:27,502
I'm flying us out of here.

864
00:59:27,535 --> 00:59:29,203
Tell me where
you want to be dropped.

865
00:59:29,237 --> 00:59:30,672
You ever flown to Biosyn?

866
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,442
Owen, they took her to Biosyn!

867
00:59:34,475 --> 00:59:36,811
-There's an airfield on the
north side of the island. -Go.

868
00:59:36,844 --> 00:59:38,513
You're under arrest.

869
00:59:38,546 --> 00:59:40,248
Stay where you are.

870
01:00:06,374 --> 01:00:08,276
Right!

871
01:00:12,747 --> 01:00:13,848
Heads up!

872
01:01:51,813 --> 01:01:53,514
We made a lot of enemies today.

873
01:01:53,548 --> 01:01:54,449
We got to go.

874
01:01:54,482 --> 01:01:56,018
-He'll be here.
-Uh-huh.

875
01:01:59,887 --> 01:02:02,290
Out of time, out of time.

876
01:02:03,758 --> 01:02:05,526
There he is.

877
01:02:07,428 --> 01:02:09,831
-Pull over.
-That's not how planes work.

878
01:02:16,038 --> 01:02:17,805
Open the back.

879
01:02:36,491 --> 01:02:37,658
Come on!

880
01:02:42,396 --> 01:02:45,399
Hold on tight!

881
01:03:01,349 --> 01:03:03,818
Oh, sh...

882
01:03:14,362 --> 01:03:15,830
Still got it.

883
01:03:34,849 --> 01:03:36,984
Kayla Watts.

884
01:03:37,019 --> 01:03:38,719
You're welcome.

885
01:03:38,753 --> 01:03:40,721
You don't look like
you fly for Biosyn.

886
01:03:40,755 --> 01:03:42,390
I'm gonna take that
the way you meant it

887
01:03:42,423 --> 01:03:44,358
and not the way it sounded.

888
01:03:44,392 --> 01:03:45,860
I fly from whoever got a bag,

889
01:03:45,893 --> 01:03:47,461
but we'll call this one a favor.

890
01:03:47,495 --> 01:03:50,364
Those don't work. They broke.

891
01:03:51,499 --> 01:03:52,800
I'll take y'all to Biosyn,

892
01:03:52,834 --> 01:03:54,802
but I can't promise
it won't be dangerous.

893
01:03:54,836 --> 01:03:57,872
You're willing to risk your
life for people you never met?

894
01:03:59,141 --> 01:04:02,476
You want to ask questions,
or you want a ride?

895
01:04:05,113 --> 01:04:06,848
We'll take the ride.

896
01:04:13,788 --> 01:04:15,890
So, this is our habitat
development lab.

897
01:04:15,923 --> 01:04:18,593
A lot of exciting discoveries
as of late.

898
01:04:18,626 --> 01:04:20,095
We've brought back
numerous species

899
01:04:20,128 --> 01:04:21,529
in their purest form,

900
01:04:21,562 --> 01:04:23,865
and I mean complete,
untouched genomes.

901
01:04:23,898 --> 01:04:25,499
Like <i>Moros intrepidus.</i>

902
01:04:25,533 --> 01:04:27,135
-What?
-Yeah.

903
01:04:28,703 --> 01:04:30,072
Wow.

904
01:04:33,141 --> 01:04:35,043
What about splicing DNA?

905
01:04:35,077 --> 01:04:36,878
You know, creating new species?

906
01:04:36,911 --> 01:04:39,547
Uh, no, Dr. Sattler,
we don't do that here.

907
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:41,649
We like to think
we're more evolved.

908
01:04:46,221 --> 01:04:47,521
Okay, it looks like
we still have

909
01:04:47,555 --> 01:04:48,589
some time left before your ride.

910
01:04:48,623 --> 01:04:50,658
Uh, would you guys like to tour

911
01:04:50,691 --> 01:04:52,060
the facilities yourselves?

912
01:04:52,094 --> 01:04:54,495
Oh, uh, I mean...

913
01:04:54,528 --> 01:04:56,164
uh, we could.

914
01:04:56,198 --> 01:04:58,033
-Yeah, why not?
Great.

915
01:04:58,066 --> 01:05:00,501
I'll meet you guys at
the hyperloop, station three,

916
01:05:00,534 --> 01:05:02,637
in about 30 minutes.

917
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:04,772
Elevators are down this hall.
Not-not those.

918
01:05:04,805 --> 01:05:06,674
Those lead you down
to the sublevels.

919
01:05:06,707 --> 01:05:08,876
You need special clearance
to get down there.

920
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:11,545
-Oh, okay.
-30 minutes.

921
01:05:20,088 --> 01:05:21,889
:
Here.

922
01:05:21,923 --> 01:05:23,557
Take this.

923
01:05:24,825 --> 01:05:26,994
-Okay?
-Yep.

924
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:39,674
I'm really sorry
that it had to happen this way.

925
01:05:39,707 --> 01:05:41,976
Yep, that's what kidnappers say.

926
01:05:43,511 --> 01:05:45,147
Claire should never
have hidden you away.

927
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:47,715
You're way too important,
Maisie.

928
01:05:51,619 --> 01:05:53,788
You took her, too.

929
01:05:54,789 --> 01:05:56,224
Yeah.

930
01:05:56,258 --> 01:05:59,027
We needed her
to help us understand you.

931
01:06:03,998 --> 01:06:06,000
Hey, Beta.

932
01:06:07,069 --> 01:06:08,836
You okay?

933
01:06:08,869 --> 01:06:10,138
Did you say "Beta"?

934
01:06:10,172 --> 01:06:11,839
Is that her name?

935
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,109
I gave it to her.

936
01:06:14,142 --> 01:06:15,743
Beta's pretty special.

937
01:06:15,776 --> 01:06:18,846
You know, when we made Blue,
we used monitor lizard DNA

938
01:06:18,879 --> 01:06:21,682
to fill in the gaps
in her genome.

939
01:06:21,716 --> 01:06:24,652
Monitor lizards can reproduce
without a mate,

940
01:06:24,685 --> 01:06:28,622
so Beta and Blue
are genetically identical,

941
01:06:28,656 --> 01:06:30,725
and that's what they have
in common with you and...

942
01:06:30,758 --> 01:06:32,626
Charlotte.

943
01:06:34,762 --> 01:06:36,831
What do you know
about Charlotte?

944
01:06:36,864 --> 01:06:38,599
She died.

945
01:06:39,234 --> 01:06:40,868
A long time ago.

946
01:06:41,702 --> 01:06:43,771
It broke my grandpa's heart.

947
01:06:45,273 --> 01:06:47,009
So he made me.

948
01:06:48,576 --> 01:06:50,811
No, Maisie, actually, he didn't.

949
01:06:53,148 --> 01:06:55,583
Charlotte made you.

950
01:06:57,918 --> 01:07:00,788
I'm so excited for everyone to
see what we've been doing here.

951
01:07:00,821 --> 01:07:04,126
There's new technology
being made, new science,

952
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:06,061
like, every day almost.

953
01:07:06,094 --> 01:07:07,661
And it's great to be...

954
01:07:07,695 --> 01:07:09,231
it's great to be
in the center...

955
01:07:09,264 --> 01:07:10,898
center of that.

956
01:07:10,931 --> 01:07:15,303
Charlotte lived
on Site B with all of us.

957
01:07:15,337 --> 01:07:17,705
Till the storm.

958
01:07:17,738 --> 01:07:19,041
She loved dinosaurs.

959
01:07:19,074 --> 01:07:20,641
Charlotte, be careful.

960
01:07:20,674 --> 01:07:21,976
Yeah, I will.

961
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:24,112
She grew up around scientists.

962
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,615
Then, eventually...

963
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:29,917
...she became one herself.

964
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:31,952
A butterfly flew into
my office this morning.

965
01:07:31,986 --> 01:07:34,356
They say tiny things
have huge impacts,

966
01:07:34,389 --> 01:07:36,358
and I agree wholeheartedly.

967
01:07:36,391 --> 01:07:38,793
She was brilliant.

968
01:07:40,195 --> 01:07:42,097
In ways that I'll never be.

969
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:43,664
In the metaphysics of identity,

970
01:07:43,697 --> 01:07:45,833
can a replica
truly be the original?

971
01:07:45,866 --> 01:07:49,837
And if it's possible,
what makes it so?

972
01:07:54,675 --> 01:07:56,744
I've lost my pen.

973
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:01,216
Is that me?

974
01:08:01,249 --> 01:08:03,617
Yeah.

975
01:08:03,651 --> 01:08:05,320
Just like Blue,
Charlotte was able

976
01:08:05,353 --> 01:08:07,655
to have a child all by herself.

977
01:08:08,356 --> 01:08:12,127
She created you
with her own DNA.

978
01:08:13,128 --> 01:08:15,097
So I do have a mother.

979
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:18,632
Your grandfather didn't want
anyone to know the truth.

980
01:08:18,666 --> 01:08:21,735
He was protecting her and you.

981
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:24,005
And we're the same?

982
01:08:25,973 --> 01:08:26,841
You were.

983
01:08:26,874 --> 01:08:29,277
When you were a baby,
Charlotte started

984
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:31,313
to show symptoms
of a genetic disorder.

985
01:08:31,346 --> 01:08:33,948
That's how she died.

986
01:08:33,981 --> 01:08:37,718
She didn't know she had it
until after you were born.

987
01:08:37,751 --> 01:08:39,787
Do I have it, too?

988
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:40,855
No.

989
01:08:40,888 --> 01:08:43,258
She changed your DNA.

990
01:08:43,291 --> 01:08:46,128
She altered every cell
in your body

991
01:08:46,161 --> 01:08:48,196
to eradicate this disease.

992
01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:51,199
No one on earth has ever
known how to do that.

993
01:08:51,233 --> 01:08:53,168
She fixed me.

994
01:08:53,201 --> 01:08:56,204
Charlotte's discovery
is a part of you now.

995
01:08:58,173 --> 01:09:01,443
Your DNA could change the world.

996
01:09:01,476 --> 01:09:03,777
And I have to know
how she did it,

997
01:09:03,811 --> 01:09:06,148
but I just can't
replicate her work.

998
01:09:06,181 --> 01:09:07,848
If I could just study you

999
01:09:07,882 --> 01:09:11,253
and Beta, whose DNA
was never changed, I could...

1000
01:09:13,455 --> 01:09:16,391
...fix a terrible mistake
that I've made.

1001
01:09:16,424 --> 01:09:18,726
What kind of mistake?

1002
01:09:26,468 --> 01:09:29,137
Sublevel six. Restricted.

1003
01:09:33,341 --> 01:09:35,210
Thanks for coming.

1004
01:09:39,813 --> 01:09:41,483
Which lab did Malcolm say?

1005
01:09:41,516 --> 01:09:43,784
L4.

1006
01:09:47,355 --> 01:09:49,757
This is it.

1007
01:10:08,143 --> 01:10:12,180
Okay, get in,
get the sample and get out.

1008
01:10:12,214 --> 01:10:13,481
And move slow.

1009
01:10:13,515 --> 01:10:16,251
They can swarm at
the slightest disturbance.

1010
01:10:40,408 --> 01:10:42,177
Orthoptera.

1011
01:10:43,144 --> 01:10:45,113
Two weeks.

1012
01:10:48,516 --> 01:10:50,518
Fully mature.

1013
01:10:50,552 --> 01:10:52,254
This one.

1014
01:10:54,189 --> 01:10:56,157
Ready? Easy.

1015
01:11:00,495 --> 01:11:02,130
Okay.

1016
01:11:02,163 --> 01:11:03,797
Go.

1017
01:11:04,432 --> 01:11:05,866
What?

1018
01:11:06,601 --> 01:11:08,370
Go get it.

1019
01:11:10,171 --> 01:11:11,539
Is that necessary?

1020
01:11:11,573 --> 01:11:14,209
What did you think
was gonna happen?

1021
01:11:14,242 --> 01:11:15,477
I have to take a sample.

1022
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:17,178
We need concrete evidence.
This is it.

1023
01:11:17,212 --> 01:11:19,381
Alan, you said
there was no time.

1024
01:11:19,414 --> 01:11:20,881
Can you get it?

1025
01:11:20,914 --> 01:11:23,118
Of course I can get it.

1026
01:11:24,052 --> 01:11:26,854
-Easy. -

1027
01:11:27,489 --> 01:11:29,157
Watch its legs.

1028
01:11:31,593 --> 01:11:33,295
Here we go.

1029
01:11:35,096 --> 01:11:36,431
They're cell signaling
between them.

1030
01:11:36,464 --> 01:11:37,532
This is not good, Ellie.

1031
01:11:37,565 --> 01:11:38,899
Almost got it.

1032
01:11:41,202 --> 01:11:43,837
How does she remain
an asset, Henry,

1033
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,573
if you're incriminating
both of us

1034
01:11:45,607 --> 01:11:47,941
by showing her classified things
on the computer?

1035
01:11:47,975 --> 01:11:49,210
Charlotte Lockwood believed

1036
01:11:49,244 --> 01:11:50,844
the methods we used
at Jurassic Park

1037
01:11:50,878 --> 01:11:52,846
could cure disease.

1038
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,182
She was right.

1039
01:11:54,215 --> 01:11:56,584
Having filled the gaps
in Maisie's genome

1040
01:11:56,618 --> 01:11:58,553
with altered DNA,

1041
01:11:58,586 --> 01:12:00,155
she used a pathogen to deliver

1042
01:12:00,188 --> 01:12:02,324
the repaired sequence
to every cell.

1043
01:12:02,357 --> 01:12:04,592
If I can repurpose what she did,

1044
01:12:04,626 --> 01:12:07,028
I could change the locusts' DNA,

1045
01:12:07,062 --> 01:12:09,197
eradicating them
in a single generation.

1046
01:12:09,230 --> 01:12:13,335
Maisie and the baby raptor
will provide the missing data.

1047
01:12:20,141 --> 01:12:22,876
Hey, do you want
to get out of here?

1048
01:12:25,946 --> 01:12:28,116
What the...?

1049
01:12:29,017 --> 01:12:30,352
-Got it.

1050
01:12:34,522 --> 01:12:36,224
Go!

1051
01:12:40,362 --> 01:12:42,364
-They're everywhere!

1052
01:12:42,397 --> 01:12:44,099
Help me! Oh, God!

1053
01:12:44,132 --> 01:12:46,067
No!

1054
01:12:48,136 --> 01:12:49,937
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1055
01:12:55,243 --> 01:12:56,611
Maisie.

1056
01:13:08,156 --> 01:13:10,024
Asset containment breach.

1057
01:13:10,058 --> 01:13:12,060
Please remain at your stations.

1058
01:13:13,561 --> 01:13:15,029
Asset containment breach.

1059
01:13:15,063 --> 01:13:16,664
Please remain at your stations.

1060
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:22,103
-Oh, my God! Oh, God, I can't
see! -ALAN: Where's the key?

1061
01:13:40,588 --> 01:13:42,424
You okay?

1062
01:13:42,457 --> 01:13:44,159
Yeah.

1063
01:13:44,192 --> 01:13:45,560
You?

1064
01:13:45,593 --> 01:13:47,061
Yeah.

1065
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:50,931
Oh.

1066
01:13:56,271 --> 01:14:00,642
You're Dr. Ellie Sattler
and Alan Grant.

1067
01:14:00,675 --> 01:14:02,976
You were at Jurassic Park.

1068
01:14:03,011 --> 01:14:05,046
What-what are you doing here?

1069
01:14:05,079 --> 01:14:07,015
What? What...

1070
01:14:07,048 --> 01:14:09,117
what are you doing here?

1071
01:14:10,785 --> 01:14:13,054
I'm Maisie Lockwood.

1072
01:14:21,329 --> 01:14:23,064
Um...

1073
01:14:23,097 --> 01:14:26,234
Hey, we don't, uh...

1074
01:14:26,267 --> 01:14:28,636
we're not...
we don't work for Biosyn.

1075
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:29,771
I can tell.

1076
01:14:29,804 --> 01:14:31,339
We got to get out of here.

1077
01:14:31,372 --> 01:14:32,474
Yeah, we should go.

1078
01:14:48,089 --> 01:14:51,059
Okay, in and out--
we find your girl and go.

1079
01:14:52,126 --> 01:14:53,761
Tower, this is N-141.

1080
01:14:53,795 --> 01:14:55,497
Request to land for
a freight delivery. Over.

1081
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:58,099
Uh, N-141, negative.
We've been advised

1082
01:14:58,132 --> 01:15:00,235
you're carrying
unauthorized passengers. Over.

1083
01:15:00,268 --> 01:15:01,636
Copy that, tower.

1084
01:15:01,669 --> 01:15:04,038
Be advised
shipment is perishable.

1085
01:15:04,072 --> 01:15:05,373
We need immediate clearance.

1086
01:15:05,406 --> 01:15:08,109
-It's an emergency. Over.
-There isn't... No.

1087
01:15:08,142 --> 01:15:10,545
Uh, negative.
Return to point of origin.

1088
01:15:10,578 --> 01:15:12,113
Uh, you seem to be breaking up.

1089
01:15:12,146 --> 01:15:13,481
Are-are you hearing me
on your side?

1090
01:15:15,717 --> 01:15:18,219
Nice try, Kayla.
They will down your bird.

1091
01:15:18,853 --> 01:15:21,122
Who is this? Is this Denise?

1092
01:15:21,155 --> 01:15:23,625
You do not want me to start
spilling secrets, Denise.

1093
01:15:23,658 --> 01:15:25,393
You remember Dubrovnik.

1094
01:15:26,761 --> 01:15:29,831
She's... Different Denise.

1095
01:15:29,864 --> 01:15:32,166
In accounts.

1096
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,675
Talked to Santos.

1097
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:42,410
It's the girl's parents.

1098
01:15:45,179 --> 01:15:47,482
Sh-Shut off the ADS.

1099
01:15:47,515 --> 01:15:49,484
You sure?

1100
01:15:49,517 --> 01:15:51,486
Uh-huh.

1101
01:15:57,125 --> 01:15:58,760
What's that?

1102
01:15:58,793 --> 01:16:00,762
Uh, that's the, uh...

1103
01:16:00,795 --> 01:16:02,597
that's the aerial
deterrent system.

1104
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:03,831
Keeps the airborne life away.

1105
01:16:03,865 --> 01:16:05,533
Why is it blinking?

1106
01:16:05,567 --> 01:16:07,435
Because dead-ass Denise in
the tower just turned it off.

1107
01:16:07,468 --> 01:16:09,237
We got to get out of
this airspace right now.

1108
01:16:14,175 --> 01:16:17,178
-That's another plane, right?
-Not exactly.

1109
01:16:20,148 --> 01:16:21,549
Is that a...

1110
01:16:21,583 --> 01:16:23,251
<i>Quetzalcoatlus.</i>

1111
01:16:23,284 --> 01:16:25,587
Late Cretaceous.
Should've stayed there.

1112
01:16:31,626 --> 01:16:34,162
Okay. Okay.

1113
01:16:34,195 --> 01:16:36,431
It's cool. We're good.
It's gone.

1114
01:16:53,414 --> 01:16:54,882
This plane is going down.

1115
01:16:54,916 --> 01:16:58,186
If you're going to eject,
you need to do it now.

1116
01:16:58,219 --> 01:17:00,254
I only got one chair,
and she's in it.

1117
01:17:00,288 --> 01:17:03,257
-You don't have parachutes?
-I wasn't expecting company.

1118
01:17:10,932 --> 01:17:12,367
Claire.

1119
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,901
We got to get you
off this plane.

1120
01:17:13,935 --> 01:17:15,403
What?

1121
01:17:15,436 --> 01:17:16,771
Parachute is gonna open
automatically.

1122
01:17:16,804 --> 01:17:17,905
If it doesn't,
you pull this lever.

1123
01:17:17,939 --> 01:17:19,207
Do you understand me?

1124
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,775
-Claire!

1125
01:17:20,808 --> 01:17:22,443
If it doesn't open
automatically,

1126
01:17:22,477 --> 01:17:24,245
you're gonna pull this lever
here behind you, okay?

1127
01:17:24,278 --> 01:17:26,314
-10,000 feet!
-Hey.

1128
01:17:26,347 --> 01:17:27,815
You're the one who's got to go
to get to her.

1129
01:17:27,849 --> 01:17:30,284
You're her mom.
You're her only shot.

1130
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:35,256
I'll see you again.

1131
01:17:35,957 --> 01:17:38,459
-I love you.

1132
01:18:26,974 --> 01:18:27,975
What's the plan?

1133
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:29,811
Whatever happens.

1134
01:18:29,844 --> 01:18:31,646
That's the plan.

1135
01:18:45,326 --> 01:18:46,961
Three.
That's it.

1136
01:18:46,994 --> 01:18:48,863
Alan, we need the code.

1137
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:50,264
Let's try this thing.

1138
01:18:50,298 --> 01:18:51,499
-Yeah.

1139
01:18:51,532 --> 01:18:53,501
Get down.

1140
01:18:58,906 --> 01:19:00,608
-Thank God it's you.
-I don't know...

1141
01:19:00,641 --> 01:19:02,610
-This place is such a maze.

1142
01:19:02,643 --> 01:19:04,012
-We were so confused.
-It's good you're here.

1143
01:19:04,046 --> 01:19:05,513
But I thought
we were straight-up lost,

1144
01:19:05,546 --> 01:19:07,015
then you said station three,
and I was like...

1145
01:19:07,049 --> 01:19:08,916
-We thought you said...
-Do you have the sample?

1146
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:11,285
-What?
-What are you talking about?

1147
01:19:11,319 --> 01:19:12,754
The DNA sample-- do you have it?

1148
01:19:12,787 --> 01:19:15,523
Biosyn's responsible
for the locust epidemic.

1149
01:19:15,556 --> 01:19:17,291
Dodgson's covering it up.
You were right.

1150
01:19:17,325 --> 01:19:19,360
I'm-I'm here to help you.

1151
01:19:19,393 --> 01:19:20,962
Do you have it?

1152
01:19:20,995 --> 01:19:22,597
-Uh...
-: Yeah.

1153
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:23,664
Good.

1154
01:19:24,699 --> 01:19:26,334
This pod will take you
straight to the airfield.

1155
01:19:26,367 --> 01:19:27,935
We have a plane ready to fly.

1156
01:19:27,969 --> 01:19:29,637
Ian told you
about Hexapod Allies?

1157
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:31,773
No. I told him.

1158
01:19:31,806 --> 01:19:33,374
What?

1159
01:19:33,407 --> 01:19:35,643
-Okay, you guys got to go.
Wait.

1160
01:19:39,413 --> 01:19:41,415
Maisie.

1161
01:19:44,685 --> 01:19:45,887
Maisie Lockwood.

1162
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:50,424
Go.

1163
01:24:04,678 --> 01:24:06,647
That was my baby.

1164
01:24:14,755 --> 01:24:17,025
Where'd you learn to fly?

1165
01:24:17,059 --> 01:24:18,993
Uh, Air Force.

1166
01:24:19,027 --> 01:24:20,328
Legacy on my mama's side.

1167
01:24:20,362 --> 01:24:22,097
Yeah. I'm Navy.

1168
01:24:22,963 --> 01:24:24,932
And so, how'd you end up
doing this?

1169
01:24:24,965 --> 01:24:27,202
I was a legit contract pilot
for a grip,

1170
01:24:27,235 --> 01:24:28,736
but didn't exactly pay enough

1171
01:24:28,769 --> 01:24:30,272
to be out here
and send the money home,

1172
01:24:30,305 --> 01:24:33,208
so I hit up a few contacts for
the more lucrative shady shit.

1173
01:24:34,842 --> 01:24:37,212
Honestly, I might be done
with this line of work.

1174
01:24:37,245 --> 01:24:39,114
Is that why you're helping us?

1175
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:45,586
I was there when they handed
your girl off to Biosyn.

1176
01:24:46,388 --> 01:24:49,824
I could've said something,
but I didn't.

1177
01:24:49,857 --> 01:24:52,060
And when I saw her picture...

1178
01:24:53,928 --> 01:24:55,996
It isn't enough to do nothing.

1179
01:25:01,203 --> 01:25:02,870
Thank you.

1180
01:25:49,151 --> 01:25:51,052
No.

1181
01:25:55,323 --> 01:25:56,358
Nope.

1182
01:26:20,482 --> 01:26:22,750
What an asshole.

1183
01:27:13,401 --> 01:27:14,868
You good?

1184
01:27:14,902 --> 01:27:16,371
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1185
01:27:16,404 --> 01:27:17,838
Yeah, I'm not shook at all. You?

1186
01:27:17,871 --> 01:27:20,075
Nah. Nah, no.

1187
01:27:21,809 --> 01:27:23,777
The ejection seat beacon.

1188
01:27:23,811 --> 01:27:26,348
-We'll find her.
-Okay. Okay.

1189
01:27:26,381 --> 01:27:28,283
You really love her, huh?

1190
01:27:29,551 --> 01:27:31,319
Yeah.

1191
01:27:31,353 --> 01:27:33,054
I get it.

1192
01:27:33,921 --> 01:27:36,024
I like redheads, too.

1193
01:27:37,025 --> 01:27:38,560
What? God.

1194
01:27:42,063 --> 01:27:42,796
Who is that?

1195
01:27:42,830 --> 01:27:44,999
It's Grant and Sattler.

1196
01:27:45,033 --> 01:27:47,135
-Is this live?
-12 minutes ago.

1197
01:27:47,168 --> 01:27:48,936
We were tracking
the escaped asset.

1198
01:27:48,969 --> 01:27:50,205
Our guys missed it.

1199
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:52,374
-They stole a DNA sample.

1200
01:27:53,308 --> 01:27:55,410
-How'd they get in there?
-They used an access key.

1201
01:27:55,443 --> 01:27:57,579
Yankee White clearance.

1202
01:27:57,612 --> 01:27:59,581
One of our cameras
saw Ian Malcolm

1203
01:27:59,614 --> 01:28:02,150
put something
in Sattler's pocket.

1204
01:28:02,183 --> 01:28:04,286
All right.

1205
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:05,587
I want to see him.

1206
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:08,390
And get Ramsay up here,
too, will you?

1207
01:28:08,423 --> 01:28:09,823
Where are they now?

1208
01:28:09,857 --> 01:28:11,859
On the way to the airfield.

1209
01:28:11,892 --> 01:28:14,062
They caught the hyperloop
right on schedule.

1210
01:28:20,201 --> 01:28:22,037
How are you?

1211
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:24,139
-You all right?

1212
01:28:24,938 --> 01:28:26,840
Not really, no.

1213
01:28:28,443 --> 01:28:30,312
Hey.

1214
01:28:30,345 --> 01:28:33,081
I, uh, knew your mom.

1215
01:28:36,284 --> 01:28:37,419
You did?

1216
01:28:37,452 --> 01:28:39,187
Mm-hmm.

1217
01:28:40,221 --> 01:28:44,025
Yeah, a few years
after Hammond died,

1218
01:28:44,059 --> 01:28:48,063
she came to my university
to lecture, and...

1219
01:28:48,096 --> 01:28:50,198
we became good friends.

1220
01:28:50,231 --> 01:28:52,133
What was she like?

1221
01:28:52,167 --> 01:28:53,234
Brilliant.

1222
01:28:53,268 --> 01:28:55,337
Light-years ahead
of everybody else.

1223
01:28:56,904 --> 01:28:58,340
And she had a conscience.

1224
01:28:58,373 --> 01:29:00,941
While they were out
building theme parks,

1225
01:29:00,974 --> 01:29:02,577
well, she was
determined to prove

1226
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:05,113
that genetic power
could save lives.

1227
01:29:06,314 --> 01:29:08,083
And I was her experiment.

1228
01:29:08,116 --> 01:29:09,417
No.

1229
01:29:11,286 --> 01:29:13,421
She wanted a child
more than anything.

1230
01:29:14,356 --> 01:29:17,958
But she wanted you to have
what she couldn't.

1231
01:29:18,593 --> 01:29:20,462
A full life.

1232
01:29:23,131 --> 01:29:25,300
I didn't know her long.

1233
01:29:26,167 --> 01:29:28,403
But I know
she loved you very much.

1234
01:29:48,556 --> 01:29:50,225
What's happening?

1235
01:29:55,029 --> 01:29:57,399
This must be
the old amber mines.

1236
01:29:58,433 --> 01:30:02,237
They must have made access doors
when they built these tunnels.

1237
01:30:26,361 --> 01:30:27,695
Hey.

1238
01:30:27,729 --> 01:30:30,165
I heard the alarm.
Everything all right?

1239
01:30:30,198 --> 01:30:32,567
Yeah, no, no.
Nothing we can't, uh, handle.

1240
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:34,436
-Listen...
-You rang?

1241
01:30:34,469 --> 01:30:36,271
Oh, good. Dr. Malcolm.

1242
01:30:36,304 --> 01:30:38,440
You are... fired.

1243
01:30:38,473 --> 01:30:40,074
What?

1244
01:30:40,108 --> 01:30:43,311
It was such a cushy gig.

1245
01:30:43,344 --> 01:30:46,581
You can, uh, give
your access key to security,

1246
01:30:46,614 --> 01:30:48,316
if you still have it.

1247
01:30:48,349 --> 01:30:49,751
One of the hyperloop pods just
shut down in the amber mines.

1248
01:30:49,784 --> 01:30:51,486
What?

1249
01:30:52,487 --> 01:30:54,722
Wow. This day.

1250
01:30:54,756 --> 01:30:56,724
Uh, which... which pod are we...

1251
01:30:56,758 --> 01:30:58,726
Are there, um...

1252
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:00,628
dinosaurs in the mines?

1253
01:31:00,662 --> 01:31:02,263
There are dinosaurs everywhere.

1254
01:31:02,297 --> 01:31:03,565
I mean, you know, technically,
birds are dinosaurs.

1255
01:31:03,598 --> 01:31:05,066
Ge-Genetically speaking...

1256
01:31:05,099 --> 01:31:06,468
Okay, Lewis, Grant and Sattler
are in this pod.

1257
01:31:06,501 --> 01:31:08,336
We need to send
a security team out there ASAP.

1258
01:31:08,369 --> 01:31:10,271
Okay. Absolutely, Ramsay.
Thank you.

1259
01:31:10,305 --> 01:31:12,340
Uh, let's all just stay
in our lanes, though.

1260
01:31:12,373 --> 01:31:14,476
We can take care of it.
Thank you, Doctor.

1261
01:31:14,509 --> 01:31:17,145
That's it, huh?
Nothing else to see here?

1262
01:31:17,178 --> 01:31:20,415
Uh, I'm not sure I admire
your tone right now.

1263
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:22,750
-You need to leave.
Yeah, I do.

1264
01:31:22,784 --> 01:31:26,287
But first, I owe
all these folks an apology.

1265
01:31:26,321 --> 01:31:28,623
I think that by lending
my cachet to this joint

1266
01:31:28,656 --> 01:31:30,391
I might have made it seem as if

1267
01:31:30,425 --> 01:31:32,093
Biosyn wasn't
rotten to the core.

1268
01:31:32,126 --> 01:31:33,261
That's enough, Ian.

1269
01:31:33,294 --> 01:31:34,629
See, here's how they get you.

1270
01:31:34,662 --> 01:31:35,797
They give you so many promotions

1271
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:37,465
in a short period of time

1272
01:31:37,499 --> 01:31:39,367
that it bludgeons your capacity
for critical thinking.

1273
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:42,237
-Oh, my God. -So then there are
doors that you don't open,

1274
01:31:42,270 --> 01:31:43,705
things that you ignore.

1275
01:31:43,738 --> 01:31:49,244
But mainly, he's exploiting
your enchantment with these.

1276
01:31:49,277 --> 01:31:51,312
Is there an actual concern
here, or are you just...

1277
01:31:51,346 --> 01:31:53,715
You're racing toward
the extinction of our species,

1278
01:31:53,748 --> 01:31:55,450
and you don't care.

1279
01:31:55,483 --> 01:31:58,486
You know exactly what you're
doing, but you won't stop.

1280
01:31:58,520 --> 01:31:59,787
You can't.

1281
01:31:59,821 --> 01:32:01,689
You know, I thought
you might be different,

1282
01:32:01,723 --> 01:32:03,224
but you're just like
everyone else.

1283
01:32:03,258 --> 01:32:04,659
You see what you want to see.

1284
01:32:04,692 --> 01:32:07,629
You imagine unchecked avarice,

1285
01:32:07,662 --> 01:32:09,430
so that's what you find.

1286
01:32:09,464 --> 01:32:12,734
You envision what,
an evil, unbound Prometheus?

1287
01:32:12,767 --> 01:32:14,269
So that's what I am to you?

1288
01:32:14,302 --> 01:32:15,803
Prometheus got gored.

1289
01:32:15,837 --> 01:32:18,373
So will you,
you rapacious rat bastard.

1290
01:32:18,406 --> 01:32:22,644
Ramsay, would you help
Dr. Malcolm gather his things?

1291
01:32:23,578 --> 01:32:26,214
His room, and then
to the airfield. That's it.

1292
01:32:35,523 --> 01:32:37,191
Dodgson.

1293
01:33:40,788 --> 01:33:42,590
Oh, God.

1294
01:34:10,284 --> 01:34:12,420
<i>Allosaurus?</i>

1295
01:34:13,655 --> 01:34:15,356
<i>Giganotosaurus.</i>

1296
01:34:15,390 --> 01:34:17,425
Largest known
terrestrial carnivore.

1297
01:34:18,359 --> 01:34:20,528
You put two apex predators
in one valley,

1298
01:34:20,561 --> 01:34:22,830
pretty soon there's only
gonna be one.

1299
01:34:53,995 --> 01:34:56,297
Did you feel that?

1300
01:34:57,765 --> 01:34:59,467
That's an air current.

1301
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:01,602
There must be
an opening up ahead.

1302
01:35:02,503 --> 01:35:04,706
How old is this mine,
do you think?

1303
01:35:04,739 --> 01:35:06,474
Just breathe.

1304
01:35:06,507 --> 01:35:08,676
Nobody panic.
Just watch out for bats.

1305
01:35:08,710 --> 01:35:10,578
-Who said anything about bats?
-I hate bats.

1306
01:35:10,611 --> 01:35:13,648
Well, there's probably no bats,
no falling rocks.

1307
01:35:13,681 --> 01:35:15,450
Just the possibility
of toxic gas,

1308
01:35:15,483 --> 01:35:16,918
dehydration, hypothermia.

1309
01:35:16,951 --> 01:35:18,986
Just possibilities,
nothing for certain.

1310
01:35:19,021 --> 01:35:20,888
Oh, I should've
left you where you were.

1311
01:35:20,922 --> 01:35:22,724
-Why did I bring you into this?
-What?

1312
01:35:22,757 --> 01:35:24,859
-You were happy
in your element. -What?

1313
01:35:24,892 --> 01:35:26,694
-Ellie.
-What?

1314
01:35:26,728 --> 01:35:28,629
I wasn't happy.

1315
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:31,332
You weren't?

1316
01:35:31,365 --> 01:35:33,367
Do you guys have kids?
-What?

1317
01:35:33,401 --> 01:35:35,037
Uh...

1318
01:35:35,070 --> 01:35:36,771
No, I-I do.

1319
01:35:36,804 --> 01:35:37,905
Two.

1320
01:35:37,939 --> 01:35:39,407
But not with him?

1321
01:35:40,908 --> 01:35:42,744
Uh...

1322
01:35:42,777 --> 01:35:44,645
no.

1323
01:35:44,679 --> 01:35:47,281
No, just old friends.

1324
01:35:47,315 --> 01:35:50,485
Just old friends.

1325
01:35:50,518 --> 01:35:52,553
Really?

1326
01:35:56,724 --> 01:35:58,659
Won't be long before
security knows you're gone.

1327
01:35:58,693 --> 01:36:01,295
Oh, a map.
That looks like an old map.

1328
01:36:01,329 --> 01:36:02,296
You don't have a new map?

1329
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:03,531
There's an access gate

1330
01:36:03,564 --> 01:36:05,033
at the northeast corner
of the mine.

1331
01:36:05,067 --> 01:36:06,334
-If your friends make it out...
-If?

1332
01:36:06,367 --> 01:36:07,802
When they make it out...

1333
01:36:07,835 --> 01:36:09,637
-Yes, sir.
-...that's where they'll be.

1334
01:36:09,670 --> 01:36:12,707
These roads are protected,
right?

1335
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:14,342
Uh, yeah. I'd drive fast.

1336
01:36:24,952 --> 01:36:26,821
You did good.

1337
01:36:26,854 --> 01:36:28,389
Uh, yeah, well, actually,

1338
01:36:28,422 --> 01:36:30,691
it's a complete disaster,
but thanks.

1339
01:36:31,692 --> 01:36:32,794
Not yet.

1340
01:36:43,571 --> 01:36:45,473
Watch yourself.

1341
01:37:04,092 --> 01:37:06,494
-Ellie.
-Yeah.

1342
01:37:10,998 --> 01:37:12,767
What was that?

1343
01:37:18,973 --> 01:37:20,608
Be careful.

1344
01:37:35,456 --> 01:37:36,757
-Oh, my God, Alan.
-Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1345
01:37:54,976 --> 01:37:56,510
Forget the hat!

1346
01:37:57,212 --> 01:37:59,580
-Come on!

1347
01:38:06,821 --> 01:38:08,422
Go, go, go!

1348
01:38:09,057 --> 01:38:10,925
Go, go, go, go, go!

1349
01:38:15,130 --> 01:38:16,697
It's a car.

1350
01:38:18,466 --> 01:38:20,501
-Oh, my God. Ian!
-Ian, over here!

1351
01:38:21,869 --> 01:38:23,704
Please, Ian!
Open the gate.

1352
01:38:23,738 --> 01:38:25,173
-Please help us.

1353
01:38:25,207 --> 01:38:26,807
Do you know the code?

1354
01:38:26,841 --> 01:38:28,809
I didn't know there was
gonna be a code.

1355
01:38:29,543 --> 01:38:31,545
I didn't know there was
gonna be a code.

1356
01:38:31,579 --> 01:38:34,016
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1357
01:38:35,516 --> 01:38:37,485
The brake! Pull the brake!

1358
01:38:37,518 --> 01:38:39,187
There are 10,000 possibilities.

1359
01:38:39,221 --> 01:38:41,656
-Push your legs against it!

1360
01:38:41,689 --> 01:38:44,492
-1984.
Come on, Ian!

1361
01:38:44,525 --> 01:38:46,627
-Kick up against it! -Hurry!

1362
01:38:46,661 --> 01:38:50,798
Miles Davis's birthday-- 0526.

1363
01:38:55,002 --> 01:38:56,837
-Ian!
-Please, please.

1364
01:38:56,871 --> 01:38:57,972
Do something!

1365
01:38:58,005 --> 01:38:59,507
We're not gonna make it.

1366
01:38:59,540 --> 01:39:01,709
Let's-let's all try
and stay positive.

1367
01:39:17,758 --> 01:39:20,995
-Please.
-I know, I know, I know.

1368
01:39:26,301 --> 01:39:28,636
Oh, my God! Close it!

1369
01:39:30,138 --> 01:39:32,074
What do you know?
It actually worked.

1370
01:39:36,744 --> 01:39:38,980
Ian, this is Maisie.

1371
01:39:39,014 --> 01:39:40,815
Hi, Maisie.

1372
01:39:40,848 --> 01:39:42,683
We got the DNA.

1373
01:39:43,617 --> 01:39:44,986
We need to get out
of this valley.

1374
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:47,888
-Yeah. Let's go. Let's go.
-Come on. Come on.

1375
01:40:18,786 --> 01:40:20,888
Come on. Come, come on.

1376
01:41:30,125 --> 01:41:32,060
Go on, get!

1377
01:41:32,094 --> 01:41:34,129
Yuck.

1378
01:41:34,162 --> 01:41:36,098
-Oh, my God.
-Hey.

1379
01:41:36,131 --> 01:41:38,333
Oh, my God.

1380
01:41:38,366 --> 01:41:40,035
I thought you were dead.

1381
01:41:40,068 --> 01:41:41,702
What do they even eat?

1382
01:41:46,774 --> 01:41:48,742
We better get inside.

1383
01:42:29,050 --> 01:42:30,951
Oh, go ahead.

1384
01:43:09,357 --> 01:43:12,093
Containment
chamber compromised.

1385
01:43:28,009 --> 01:43:29,077
It's locked.

1386
01:43:29,110 --> 01:43:31,879
Gonna need something heavy,
something sharp or both.

1387
01:43:42,524 --> 01:43:45,960
That... can't be right.

1388
01:43:57,372 --> 01:43:59,474
-Is that...?
-Oh, no.

1389
01:43:59,507 --> 01:44:01,343
Oh, my God.

1390
01:44:03,011 --> 01:44:04,945
He's burning the evidence.

1391
01:44:06,214 --> 01:44:07,549
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

1392
01:44:07,582 --> 01:44:09,817
-Oh, my... Ew!
-That's bananas.

1393
01:44:27,168 --> 01:44:28,069
Oh, my God.

1394
01:44:28,103 --> 01:44:33,774
I-I-I know this may seem
precarious, but...

1395
01:44:34,409 --> 01:44:35,976
No, we're-we're teetering.

1396
01:44:38,313 --> 01:44:40,548
Should we all lean
to the left or something?

1397
01:44:40,582 --> 01:44:42,284
That's very constructive.
Thank you, Maisie.

1398
01:44:42,317 --> 01:44:44,419
Yeah.

1399
01:44:44,452 --> 01:44:47,022
Slow. Slow.

1400
01:44:48,156 --> 01:44:49,923
Slow.

1401
01:44:52,093 --> 01:44:53,595
Yay.

1402
01:44:53,628 --> 01:44:55,196
We're fine.

1403
01:44:55,230 --> 01:44:57,032
-See this?
-Mm-hmm.

1404
01:44:57,065 --> 01:44:58,932
-This is fine.
-Mm-hmm.

1405
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:14,149
Alan?

1406
01:45:14,182 --> 01:45:15,617
: Alan!

1407
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:17,252
How is everybody?

1408
01:45:27,095 --> 01:45:29,431
:
It's my parents.

1409
01:45:30,398 --> 01:45:31,965
Help!

1410
01:45:31,999 --> 01:45:33,535
:
Help!

1411
01:45:33,568 --> 01:45:34,968
Listen.

1412
01:45:35,002 --> 01:45:37,871
Help! Help!

1413
01:45:42,110 --> 01:45:44,212
Oh, my God.

1414
01:45:44,245 --> 01:45:46,314
:
You're okay.

1415
01:45:46,348 --> 01:45:48,116
You're okay.

1416
01:45:48,149 --> 01:45:49,517
You came to get me, actually.

1417
01:45:49,551 --> 01:45:50,884
-You came to get me.
-Yeah.

1418
01:45:50,918 --> 01:45:53,054
Of course we did, sweetheart.

1419
01:45:53,088 --> 01:45:55,323
-Heya, kid.
-Of course.

1420
01:45:56,990 --> 01:45:59,027
I remember you.

1421
01:45:59,661 --> 01:46:02,263
Remember you, too.

1422
01:46:12,073 --> 01:46:14,042
They helped me escape.

1423
01:46:14,075 --> 01:46:16,177
:
Yeah?

1424
01:46:18,346 --> 01:46:20,248
You okay?

1425
01:46:23,318 --> 01:46:25,153
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

1426
01:46:27,555 --> 01:46:29,124
We got to go.

1427
01:46:29,157 --> 01:46:32,193
Gonna have to break a window
to get inside that thing.

1428
01:46:33,061 --> 01:46:35,363
Hope nobody's afraid of heights.

1429
01:46:47,575 --> 01:46:49,943
Don't move.

1430
01:47:08,096 --> 01:47:09,297
What is that?

1431
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:11,433
<i>Giganotosaurus.</i>

1432
01:47:13,635 --> 01:47:16,104
Biggest carnivore
the world has ever seen.

1433
01:47:34,489 --> 01:47:36,324
:
Maisie, Maisie, look at me.

1434
01:47:36,357 --> 01:47:38,092
Look at me.

1435
01:48:17,165 --> 01:48:19,234
-Go, go, go, go.
-Come on!

1436
01:48:23,404 --> 01:48:26,274
No, no, no! No!

1437
01:48:30,545 --> 01:48:32,413
-Hustle.
-I'm gonna die!

1438
01:48:32,447 --> 01:48:34,249
-Climb. Climb, kid.
-: No!

1439
01:48:34,282 --> 01:48:37,051
-You're not. No, you're not.
You're okay. -

1440
01:48:45,159 --> 01:48:47,462
-Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1441
01:49:03,711 --> 01:49:05,613
Come on.

1442
01:49:06,581 --> 01:49:08,283
Hey.

1443
01:49:14,489 --> 01:49:16,491
Oh, yeah. Come here.

1444
01:49:33,174 --> 01:49:35,510
-Go, go, go.
-Help me open it. Help me out.

1445
01:49:39,747 --> 01:49:41,716
I got ya.

1446
01:49:42,817 --> 01:49:44,452
Go, go, go.

1447
01:49:44,485 --> 01:49:46,220
Go, go, go, go, go!

1448
01:49:48,623 --> 01:49:49,657
Run.

1449
01:50:06,441 --> 01:50:08,376
See? Not so bad.

1450
01:50:14,682 --> 01:50:15,917
Come on.

1451
01:50:17,652 --> 01:50:19,387
Claire!

1452
01:51:01,229 --> 01:51:03,197
Call an evacuation.

1453
01:51:03,231 --> 01:51:05,266
We need to bring
the animals inside.

1454
01:51:05,299 --> 01:51:07,268
The regulations are clear
that in the event

1455
01:51:07,301 --> 01:51:09,437
-of a level two...
-Shh!

1456
01:51:10,605 --> 01:51:12,340
Jeffrey.

1457
01:51:17,545 --> 01:51:19,347
God...

1458
01:51:19,380 --> 01:51:21,315
-...damn it!
-Oh.

1459
01:51:22,650 --> 01:51:24,919
Just...

1460
01:51:24,952 --> 01:51:26,454
Just call it.

1461
01:51:26,487 --> 01:51:28,589
-Attention, attention.

1462
01:51:28,623 --> 01:51:30,958
This is an immediate
evacuation order.

1463
01:51:30,992 --> 01:51:33,294
Remote herding system
is now active.

1464
01:51:33,327 --> 01:51:36,698
All living assets en route
to emergency containment.

1465
01:51:59,387 --> 01:52:02,423
Can't get hold of anybody
since everything is, uh,

1466
01:52:02,457 --> 01:52:03,725
on fire.

1467
01:52:03,758 --> 01:52:06,461
-Dr. Sattler, get some water.
-Oh. Thanks.

1468
01:52:06,494 --> 01:52:08,730
Dr. Grant? Here you are.

1469
01:52:08,763 --> 01:52:10,431
I'm, uh... I'm Owen Grady.

1470
01:52:10,465 --> 01:52:12,034
Big fan. I read your book.

1471
01:52:12,067 --> 01:52:13,768
Well, book on tape.

1472
01:52:13,801 --> 01:52:16,038
Owen Grady, Owen Grady.

1473
01:52:16,071 --> 01:52:18,339
Yeah, I know who you are.

1474
01:52:18,372 --> 01:52:21,009
-You trained raptors.
-Yeah.

1475
01:52:21,043 --> 01:52:23,277
I tried. Yeah.

1476
01:52:23,311 --> 01:52:24,612
How you doing?

1477
01:52:24,645 --> 01:52:26,481
-The one here.

1478
01:52:26,514 --> 01:52:28,483
You, uh... you were at
Jurassic World.

1479
01:52:28,516 --> 01:52:30,018
Jurassic World?

1480
01:52:30,052 --> 01:52:32,820
Not a fan. Mm-mm.

1481
01:52:33,721 --> 01:52:36,424
Okay, so we good to find
a way out of here?

1482
01:52:36,457 --> 01:52:37,358
Yep.

1483
01:52:37,391 --> 01:52:38,893
Let's get it.

1484
01:52:38,926 --> 01:52:42,396
There's a helicopter
out in the main complex.

1485
01:52:42,430 --> 01:52:44,732
We turn the ADS back on,
we go home.

1486
01:52:44,766 --> 01:52:47,769
Wait, what's an ADS?
-Aerial deterrent system.

1487
01:52:47,802 --> 01:52:49,337
Oh, uh...

1488
01:52:49,370 --> 01:52:51,639
You know,
for the pterodactyls and shit.

1489
01:52:51,672 --> 01:52:53,041
Keeps them away
from the helicopters.

1490
01:52:53,075 --> 01:52:55,376
Well, how do we turn it back on?

1491
01:52:55,409 --> 01:52:57,012
Okay, it looks like
all the systems

1492
01:52:57,045 --> 01:52:58,513
run through to the control room,

1493
01:52:58,546 --> 01:52:59,914
which is on the third floor.

1494
01:52:59,947 --> 01:53:01,482
Oh.

1495
01:53:01,516 --> 01:53:03,684
These outposts are all
connected underground.

1496
01:53:08,923 --> 01:53:10,858
All right, easy, Rambo.

1497
01:53:21,136 --> 01:53:23,571
So you worked
in the raptor pen, huh?

1498
01:53:24,405 --> 01:53:26,108
-Yeah.
-Wow, and what-what happens?

1499
01:53:26,141 --> 01:53:28,676
Do you just tell 'em what
to do, and they, uh...

1500
01:53:28,709 --> 01:53:30,812
they comply or...?

1501
01:53:30,845 --> 01:53:34,782
Well, it's a human/animal bond
based on mutual respect.

1502
01:53:34,816 --> 01:53:37,019
Mm-hmm.

1503
01:53:37,052 --> 01:53:39,554
Had a dog once.

1504
01:53:39,587 --> 01:53:44,026
Humped my leg so much, I...
I got a callous on my shinbone.

1505
01:53:44,059 --> 01:53:45,827
That's a true story.

1506
01:53:58,140 --> 01:53:59,841
Oh, God.

1507
01:53:59,874 --> 01:54:02,343
Hey. Good.

1508
01:54:03,011 --> 01:54:04,512
Here's what I'm thinking.

1509
01:54:04,545 --> 01:54:07,448
We get started again,
you and me.

1510
01:54:07,481 --> 01:54:09,750
I can get money.

1511
01:54:10,585 --> 01:54:11,953
Yeah, money's cheap these days.

1512
01:54:11,986 --> 01:54:13,387
What-what's the matter?

1513
01:54:13,421 --> 01:54:15,489
Don't look so worried.
There's...

1514
01:54:15,523 --> 01:54:17,625
There's opportunity
in everything.

1515
01:54:17,658 --> 01:54:19,894
E-Even this.
You'll-you'll learn that.

1516
01:54:19,927 --> 01:54:21,762
I've been thinking, um...

1517
01:54:22,630 --> 01:54:24,498
Maybe you take more
of a lead now, okay?

1518
01:54:24,532 --> 01:54:26,934
You're ready, I think.

1519
01:54:26,968 --> 01:54:28,502
Here, take...

1520
01:54:28,536 --> 01:54:30,571
What the hell is
the matter with you?

1521
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:40,915
It was you.

1522
01:54:41,916 --> 01:54:44,518
You told Malcolm about
the program. You-you...

1523
01:54:45,220 --> 01:54:48,589
You set this whole thing up?
You set me up?

1524
01:54:48,623 --> 01:54:51,159
I gave you every opportunity
I did not have. I...

1525
01:54:52,660 --> 01:54:55,496
We have an understanding,
Ramsay,

1526
01:54:55,529 --> 01:54:57,665
and you do not break that.

1527
01:54:59,967 --> 01:55:01,936
I would not break this.

1528
01:55:04,906 --> 01:55:06,674
I'm not you.

1529
01:55:21,089 --> 01:55:23,591
Oh, this is very bad.

1530
01:55:24,825 --> 01:55:27,062
This is the same system
we used at the park.

1531
01:55:27,095 --> 01:55:29,764
Great, so we can, uh,
turn on the...

1532
01:55:29,797 --> 01:55:31,999
the thing, and then we all
get out of here?

1533
01:55:32,034 --> 01:55:33,968
-Let's see. ADS...

1534
01:55:34,835 --> 01:55:37,538
What's this?
What-what's error 99?

1535
01:55:37,571 --> 01:55:38,906
Not enough power.

1536
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:41,209
In a breakdown,
all available power is seized

1537
01:55:41,243 --> 01:55:43,245
by the primary system
to keep running.

1538
01:55:43,278 --> 01:55:45,080
We need all that power
to reactivate the ADS.

1539
01:55:45,113 --> 01:55:47,548
So the system's safety feature
is what's gonna kill us?

1540
01:55:47,581 --> 01:55:49,784
- Of course.
-How do we get more power?

1541
01:55:49,817 --> 01:55:51,953
Uh, well, we can't, but we can
redistribute what we have

1542
01:55:51,986 --> 01:55:53,554
if we just... just need to...

1543
01:55:53,587 --> 01:55:54,822
Shut down the primary system.

1544
01:55:54,855 --> 01:55:56,590
-Yes, exactly.
-Where is it?

1545
01:55:56,624 --> 01:55:58,193
Uh, next floor up.
-I'm coming with you.

1546
01:55:58,226 --> 01:55:59,860
We escaped down here.

1547
01:56:00,761 --> 01:56:02,230
Where is that?
Water treatment center.

1548
01:56:02,264 --> 01:56:04,565
Hydroelectric system--
sub eight.

1549
01:56:04,598 --> 01:56:06,234
Give me eight minutes,
I could find her.

1550
01:56:06,268 --> 01:56:08,602
-Wait, who's this now?
Beta.

1551
01:56:08,636 --> 01:56:10,604
-Blue's baby.
-Velociraptor.

1552
01:56:10,638 --> 01:56:12,740
-What?
-A baby raptor?

1553
01:56:12,773 --> 01:56:14,575
And you gave her a name.
How about that?

1554
01:56:14,608 --> 01:56:16,510
I made a promise
we would bring her home.

1555
01:56:16,544 --> 01:56:19,513
You made a promise
to a dinosaur.

1556
01:56:19,547 --> 01:56:21,116
You're coming with us, right?

1557
01:56:21,149 --> 01:56:22,917
Maisie, I...

1558
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:24,019
Please.

1559
01:56:26,921 --> 01:56:28,256
I'll be on channel five.

1560
01:56:28,290 --> 01:56:29,991
-Okay.
-We're on three.

1561
01:56:31,759 --> 01:56:33,028
Come back.

1562
01:56:34,029 --> 01:56:35,496
I always come back.

1563
01:56:36,664 --> 01:56:39,500
I'll have that chopper hot
in ten. Wait for my signal.

1564
01:56:40,868 --> 01:56:43,271
Evacuation phase four complete.

1565
01:56:43,305 --> 01:56:45,773
All living assets
now in containment.

1566
01:56:54,316 --> 01:56:55,783
Come on.

1567
01:57:07,828 --> 01:57:09,830
Still get nightmares?

1568
01:57:09,864 --> 01:57:12,067
All the time.

1569
01:57:12,100 --> 01:57:13,768
You?

1570
01:57:14,602 --> 01:57:16,304
I have a lot of regrets.

1571
01:57:16,338 --> 01:57:17,972
Oh, yeah?

1572
01:57:19,107 --> 01:57:20,775
Well...

1573
01:57:20,808 --> 01:57:24,645
we hold on to regret,
we stay in the past.

1574
01:57:27,382 --> 01:57:29,750
What matters, I guess, is...

1575
01:57:30,985 --> 01:57:32,787
...is what we do now.

1576
01:57:32,820 --> 01:57:33,954
Right?

1577
01:57:33,988 --> 01:57:35,157
Yeah.

1578
01:57:52,407 --> 01:57:54,775
Nobody said there'd be bugs.

1579
01:57:56,378 --> 01:57:59,214
B4. She's in here.

1580
01:57:59,247 --> 01:58:01,216
Watch the sides.

1581
01:58:01,249 --> 01:58:03,951
They always come from the sides.

1582
01:58:05,253 --> 01:58:08,390
You know, at first we thought...

1583
01:58:08,423 --> 01:58:12,060
they disembowel their prey,
but no.

1584
01:58:12,094 --> 01:58:15,629
They're smart enough to go
straight for the throat.

1585
01:58:15,663 --> 01:58:17,998
The veins, the arteries.

1586
01:58:18,866 --> 01:58:20,701
Sometimes both at the same time.

1587
01:58:20,734 --> 01:58:22,104
Okay.

1588
01:58:22,137 --> 01:58:24,638
Oh, okay.

1589
01:58:24,672 --> 01:58:25,773
We've got you.

1590
01:58:25,806 --> 01:58:27,242
It's right down that aisle.

1591
01:58:27,275 --> 01:58:29,643
-It's right down that aisle
where you are. -

1592
01:58:29,677 --> 01:58:31,246
Why are they skulking in-in...

1593
01:58:31,279 --> 01:58:32,380
You can sprint right for it.

1594
01:58:32,414 --> 01:58:34,915
Okay. Here it is.

1595
01:58:34,949 --> 01:58:37,018
Okay, so it-it'll be a yellow
button on a grid of six.

1596
01:58:37,052 --> 01:58:39,387
There's a green button.
Do you see a green button?

1597
01:58:39,421 --> 01:58:40,788
It's not that green button.

1598
01:58:40,821 --> 01:58:42,023
-It's four...
-which one's the button?

1599
01:58:42,057 --> 01:58:42,823
Four from the bottom.

1600
01:58:42,857 --> 01:58:44,259
-Above the...
Whoa, whoa.

1601
01:58:44,292 --> 01:58:45,793
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Fourth one up?

1602
01:58:45,826 --> 01:58:47,295
Third one down
or fourth one up-- same thing.

1603
01:58:47,329 --> 01:58:48,896
Ian, be specific.

1604
01:58:53,468 --> 01:58:55,203
She was here.

1605
01:58:55,237 --> 01:58:57,072
Lights off.

1606
01:59:03,178 --> 01:59:05,280
I don't know how I could
possibly be more specific

1607
01:59:05,313 --> 01:59:08,316
other than to say that the one
you want is marked with...

1608
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:10,152
-E1.
-E1. E1.

1609
01:59:10,185 --> 01:59:12,920
-E1.

1610
01:59:13,921 --> 01:59:16,224
-Yeah.

1611
01:59:20,195 --> 01:59:22,696
No. No, no, no, no.

1612
01:59:28,270 --> 01:59:31,039
Damn it, she's fast.

1613
01:59:33,408 --> 01:59:34,409
Hey.

1614
01:59:35,510 --> 01:59:37,145
Eyes on me.

1615
01:59:40,814 --> 01:59:43,851
I've got to hit her
on the side of her neck.

1616
01:59:43,884 --> 01:59:46,221
Maisie, you're gonna
hold her focus.

1617
01:59:46,254 --> 01:59:49,157
Grant, we're triangulating.

1618
01:59:55,063 --> 01:59:56,164
Go.

1619
02:00:24,925 --> 02:00:26,727
Sorry, girl.

1620
02:00:27,462 --> 02:00:29,830
I promised your mom
I'd get you home.

1621
02:00:30,831 --> 02:00:32,833
Primary system rebooting.

1622
02:00:32,866 --> 02:00:34,001
Wait. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1623
02:00:34,035 --> 02:00:35,237
-No, no, no.
-No, no, no.

1624
02:00:35,270 --> 02:00:36,371
It's rebooting.

1625
02:00:36,404 --> 02:00:37,505
No, it shouldn't be doing that.

1626
02:00:49,417 --> 02:00:51,152
Here, take this.

1627
02:01:07,001 --> 02:01:08,303
-We got to stay on it.
Ian, shut it down!

1628
02:01:08,336 --> 02:01:09,870
We're-we're gonna make it work.

1629
02:01:09,903 --> 02:01:10,971
We're gonna figure this out.
It's very complex.

1630
02:01:11,005 --> 02:01:13,074
We don't have time for complex!

1631
02:01:17,911 --> 02:01:19,913
Primary system compromised.

1632
02:01:22,484 --> 02:01:23,984
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1633
02:01:24,019 --> 02:01:25,287
Aerial deterrent system active.

1634
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:26,887
Victory! Victory!

1635
02:01:30,458 --> 02:01:32,327
Damn, that felt good.

1636
02:02:00,221 --> 02:02:03,158
Oh, come on!

1637
02:02:54,275 --> 02:02:56,111
What's your story?

1638
02:02:59,681 --> 02:03:01,383
Wait!

1639
02:03:11,292 --> 02:03:13,495
At Biosyn, we're dedicated

1640
02:03:13,528 --> 02:03:15,630
to the idea that dinosaurs

1641
02:03:15,663 --> 02:03:18,333
can teach us more
about ourselves.

1642
02:03:22,570 --> 02:03:25,473
All right,
Kayla, we're good to go.

1643
02:03:35,550 --> 02:03:37,318
Okay, cutie.

1644
02:03:42,757 --> 02:03:46,027
Oh, come here. Oh.

1645
02:03:46,060 --> 02:03:47,262
-You all right?
-Someday.

1646
02:03:47,295 --> 02:03:48,163
Okay.

1647
02:03:48,196 --> 02:03:50,231
-Hey.

1648
02:03:57,472 --> 02:03:58,606
I remember you.

1649
02:03:58,640 --> 02:04:00,742
Please, you have
to listen to me.

1650
02:04:00,775 --> 02:04:02,744
You created
an ecological disaster.

1651
02:04:02,777 --> 02:04:04,379
And I can fix it.

1652
02:04:05,380 --> 02:04:09,050
Charlotte Lockwood changed
every cell in Maisie's body.

1653
02:04:09,083 --> 02:04:10,585
It saved her life.

1654
02:04:10,618 --> 02:04:14,589
If I can understand how
Charlotte rewrote Maisie's DNA,

1655
02:04:14,622 --> 02:04:17,592
I can spread change from
one locust to the entire swarm

1656
02:04:17,625 --> 02:04:19,960
before it's too late.

1657
02:04:21,496 --> 02:04:24,466
It's okay. It's okay.

1658
02:04:27,635 --> 02:04:30,003
It's what she would have wanted.

1659
02:04:32,607 --> 02:04:34,275
Thank you.

1660
02:04:34,309 --> 02:04:35,677
No, no, no.

1661
02:04:35,710 --> 02:04:37,579
No, no, no, no, no.

1662
02:04:37,612 --> 02:04:39,481
Him?

1663
02:04:39,514 --> 02:04:40,748
Not him.

1664
02:04:40,782 --> 02:04:42,484
Not him. It's always him.

1665
02:04:42,517 --> 02:04:44,619
Every si...

1666
02:04:44,652 --> 02:04:47,188
Is that a dinosaur
on your shoulder?

1667
02:04:47,789 --> 02:04:49,990
Yeah. Why?

1668
02:04:50,625 --> 02:04:52,560
I have air.
Meet me at the center.

1669
02:04:52,594 --> 02:04:54,629
No, no, no, no, no, no.
W-Wait, wait, wait. Hey, hey.

1670
02:04:54,662 --> 02:04:56,397
D-Do... do not land in here.

1671
02:04:56,431 --> 02:04:58,099
I don't have a choice, dude.
The valley isn't safe.

1672
02:04:58,132 --> 02:05:00,468
No, they're not
in the valley anymore!

1673
02:05:01,536 --> 02:05:03,104
Oh!

1674
02:06:32,727 --> 02:06:33,761
This isn't about us.

1675
02:06:59,921 --> 02:07:01,723
Run!

1676
02:07:05,226 --> 02:07:06,894
Oh, my God!
Get him up, get him up!

1677
02:07:06,928 --> 02:07:09,230
-Come on, come on!
-Come on.

1678
02:07:12,233 --> 02:07:13,668
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

1679
02:07:17,839 --> 02:07:19,374
Come on!

1680
02:07:32,987 --> 02:07:34,722
Ellie, no!

1681
02:08:03,985 --> 02:08:05,720
Go on, Maisie! Go!

1682
02:08:07,522 --> 02:08:08,923
Ramsay, get in.
You're in.

1683
02:08:08,956 --> 02:08:11,192
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1684
02:08:14,962 --> 02:08:17,465
Everybody hold on to somebody.

1685
02:09:38,479 --> 02:09:40,281
Ow.

1686
02:09:41,682 --> 02:09:43,384
No, at every level.

1687
02:09:43,417 --> 02:09:45,887
Complete systemic corruption
in-in the executive ranks.

1688
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:48,422
"Systemic corruption."
You get that? Write that down.

1689
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:51,059
Yeah, it's crazy.

1690
02:09:51,093 --> 02:09:53,394
Oh, and then...
and then we crashed

1691
02:09:53,427 --> 02:09:54,796
into this ice lake, right?

1692
02:09:54,829 --> 02:09:56,731
I mean, they literally
owe me a plane.

1693
02:09:56,764 --> 02:09:59,600
I need to get this sample
vetted at the lab

1694
02:09:59,634 --> 02:10:02,570
before I take it
to my contact at <i>The Times.</i>

1695
02:10:04,139 --> 02:10:06,841
You could, uh, come with me.

1696
02:10:08,110 --> 02:10:10,878
Unless you need
to get back to your dig.

1697
02:10:13,414 --> 02:10:15,683
-Ellie.
-Yeah?

1698
02:10:17,585 --> 02:10:19,720
I am coming with you.

1699
02:10:29,597 --> 02:10:31,066
-I know.

1700
02:10:31,099 --> 02:10:32,500
One more minute,

1701
02:10:32,533 --> 02:10:34,635
then we'll send you home
with your folks.

Life on Earth has existed for
hundreds of millions of years.

1726
02:14:59,167 --> 02:15:01,902
And dinosaurs were only
a part of that,

02:15:01,936 --> 02:15:04,705
and we're an even smaller
part of that.
