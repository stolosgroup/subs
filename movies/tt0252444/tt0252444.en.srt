00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,200
<i>This is a true story</i>

3
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,848
<i>of my sister Daisy
and my cousin Gracie and me</i>

4
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,928
<i>when we were little.</i>

5
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,284
<i>Our people, the Jigalong mob,</i>

6
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,131
<i>We were desert people then,
walking all over our land.</i>

7
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,569
<i>My mum told me</i>

8
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,810
<i>about how the white people
came to our country.</i>

9
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,845
<i>They made a storehouse
here at Jigalong.</i>

10
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,761
<i>Brought clothes and other
things: flour, tobacco, tea.</i>

11
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,605
<i>Gave them to us on ration day.</i>

12
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,801
<i>We came there,
made a camp nearby.</i>

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,048
<i>They were building
a long fence.</i>

14
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,964
<i>My dad was a white man
working on that fence.</i>

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,571
<i>The white people
called me a half-caste.</i>

16
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,480
See that bird?
That's the Spirit Bird.

17
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,644
He will always look after you.

18
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,411
Hey, granddaughter,
watch where you run.

19
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,524
You kids will
destroy the tracks.

20
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,803
He's here somewhere.

21
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,924
Keep looking.
Maybe over there.

22
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,205
Here they are. Look.

23
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,043
He's going this way.
See the tracks?

24
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,608
Here, here. In the tree.

25
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,803
Watch out for his claws.

26
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,691
Good hunters in this family.

27
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,486
You're growing up fast, Molly.

28
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,966
That's them.

29
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,522
Molly's the big one. The
little one's her sister Daisy.

30
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,120
The middle one's their cousin,
Gracie.

31
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,443
- What about the fathers?
- Moved on.

32
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,287
- I catch 'em goanna.
- Molly got goanna!

33
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,164
Bring it here.

34
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,568
Fat one!

35
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,767
Molly, hide those kids.
Police looking for half-castes.

36
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,686
Next batch.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

37
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,043
There's two applications
for section 63 exemptions.

38
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,764
The police reports are there.

39
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,370
William Harris is applying for

40
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,245
permission to marry -
she's half-caste also.

41
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,442
And Mary Wilson
is applying for permission

42
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,608
to visit her child
at Moore River.

43
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,168
She's quite agitated.

44
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,328
Oh, and Gladys Phillips
has written

45
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,568
for permission to buy
some new shoes.

46
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,489
She had a new pair a year ago.

47
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,485
This report
from Constable Riggs

48
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,489
about the three little
half-caste girls

49
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,888
at the Jigalong Fence Depot-
Molly, Gracie and Daisy.

50
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,809
The youngest is of
particular concern.

51
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,730
She's promised to a full-blood.

52
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,683
I'm authorising their removal.

53
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,088
They're to be taken to Moore
River as soon as possible.

54
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,606
Oh, and Miss Thomas -
if you could check

55
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,802
that the rate for
police transportation

56
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,924
is still, I believe,
eight pence per mile.

57
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,883
- Yes, Mr Neville.
- Thank you.

58
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,371
That country over there,
that's woman country.

59
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,927
You can't go there.
You get big trouble.

60
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,128
Yeah, I know.

61
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,363
- Where your country?
- My country?

62
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,245
Down south. Long way from here.

63
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,924
Our dad works there
on the rabbit fence.

64
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,049
Yeah?

65
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,766
How far does rabbit fence go to?

66
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,888
The rabbit-proof fence?

67
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,806
It goes all the way to the sea
down that way.

68
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,241
Right to the top of Australia.

69
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,328
Longest fence in the world.

70
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,327
And all the way to the sea
down that way.

71
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,806
1,500 miles long.

72
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,048
Keeps the rabbits
on that side of the fence,

73
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,891
keeps the farmland
on this side of the fence.

74
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,130
That Molly's getting to be
a big girl.

75
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,449
Mr Neville's been writing to
me about those girls, you know?

76
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,689
Tell that Mr Devil
Molly not going.

77
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,962
She get married.

78
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,004
You tell that Mr Devil,
he want half-caste kid,

79
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,088
he make his own.

80
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,128
Frankie.

81
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,208
Come on, it's your turn.

82
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,288
Come and get your rations.

83
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,931
Hurry up.

84
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,805
Run!

85
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,161
Gracie, come here!

86
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,290
I've come for the girls.

87
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,402
Can't have 'em
in a black fellas' camp.

88
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,763
- My kids! Mine!
- It's the law, Maude.

89
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,723
- You've got no say in it.
- No! Mine!

90
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,525
Mr Neville's orders.

91
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,367
Move one inch
and I'll lock your mother up!

92
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,962
He's their legal guardian.

93
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,644
Get away from us! No!

94
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,684
Gracie!

95
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,644
Give me back my kids!

96
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,649
You sit up and you stay!

97
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,411
- I got the papers, Maude.!
- Don't take them!

98
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,966
You got no say in it!

99
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,048
Come along.

100
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,203
Just get in the back!

101
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,847
The three of youse, don't move.

102
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,731
There's nothing you can do here,
old girl.

103
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,764
- Nothing you can do.
- Leave them!

104
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,124
Leave them!

105
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,966
Every Aborigine
born in this state

106
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,084
comes under my control.

107
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,727
Notice, if you will,
the half-caste child -

108
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,286
and there are ever-increasing
numbers of them.

109
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,051
Now, what is
to happen to them?

110
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,087
Are we to allow the creation
of an unwanted third race?

111
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,851
Should the coloureds be
encouraged to go back to black

112
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,566
or should they be advanced
to white status

113
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,207
and be absorbed
in the white population?

114
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,687
Now, time and again
I'm asked by some white man,

115
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,529
"If I marry
this coloured person,

116
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,404
will our children be black?

117
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,171
As Chief Protector of Aborigines
it is my responsibility

118
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,965
to accept or reject
those marriages.

119
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,331
Here... is the answer.

120
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,727
Three generations.

121
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,410
Half-blood grandmother,

122
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,002
quadroon daughter,
octoroon grandson.

123
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,364
As you can see, in the third
generation, or third cross,

124
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,006
no trace of native origin
is apparent.

125
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,727
The continuing infiltration
of white blood

126
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,686
finally stamps out
the black colour.

127
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,486
The Aboriginal
has simply been...

128
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,648
bred out.

129
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,728
Now...

130
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,808
we come to...

131
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,484
the Moore River
Native Settlement.

132
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,841
Most of you are familiar with
our work here,

133
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,167
the training of servants
and farm labourers.

134
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,489
I would like to thank you
for your continuing support.

135
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,047
Hundreds of half-caste children
have been gathered up

136
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,162
and brought here
to be given the benefit

137
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,681
of everything our culture
has to offer.

138
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,970
For if we are to fit and train
such children for the future

139
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,686
they cannot be left
as they are,

140
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,203
and, in spite of himself,
the native must be helped.

141
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,802
Hello there.

142
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,609
A ghost!

143
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,005
You poor dears.

144
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,851
It's such a long way.
You must be exhausted.

145
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,203
Come along. I'll take you
straight to the dormitory.

146
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,880
Quickly. It's all right.

147
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,166
Come on. Down you hop.

148
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,008
Come along.

149
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,322
Follow me. Come along.

150
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,283
Follow me, please.

151
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,408
That's the way.

152
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,608
Come along.

153
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,722
There's some beds there.
The bucket's in the corner.

154
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,808
Hurry up.

155
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,122
Back to sleep,
the rest of you. No talking.

156
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,809
Get up!
All of youse! Make your beds.

157
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,208
Hurry up.

158
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,210
Karen, Cheryl,
stop running around.

159
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,128
Get them blankets tidy.

160
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,522
What's your name?
Where you from?

161
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,960
You'll get used to it.

162
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,448
Tracker girl, get that bucket.
Take it out now!

163
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,167
What are you standing
there dreaming about? Hurry up!

164
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,808
Move!

165
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,166
Get out to breakfast now.
Come on.

166
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,248
Get going, all of you.

167
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,367
Come on. You coming?

168
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,083
Thank you, children.
Ready for our prayers.

169
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,125
Bow your heads. Eyes closed.

170
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,882
Thank you for
the food we eat.

171
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,765
Thank you for
the world so sweet.

172
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,281
Thank you for
the birds that sing.

173
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,165
Thank you, God,
for everything.

174
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,848
There will be no talking.

175
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,329
We'll have no wangka here.

176
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,363
You talk English!

177
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,845
Now, eat!

178
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,763
Eat, or I'll hold your nose
and force it down you!

179
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,603
Here.

180
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,326
Keep still.
We've got to scrub you.

181
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,968
Let me see.

182
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,123
Doesn't that feel better?

183
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,811
- Yes, Miss Jessop.
- Yes, Miss Jessop.

184
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,526
- Thank you, Miss Jessop.
- Thank you, Miss Jessop.

185
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,608
That feels much better.

186
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,409
Here.

187
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,409
Take it.

188
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,488
Put these on.

189
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,408
Come on. Get dressed.

190
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,246
New clothes.

191
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,967
This is your new home.
We don't use that jabba here.

192
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,048
You speak English.

193
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,961
♪ Way down upon the Swanee River

194
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,004
♪ Far, far away

195
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,569
♪ There's where my heart
is turning ever

196
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,570
♪ There's where
the old folks stay

197
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,762
What are they doing?

198
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,680
Singing Mr Debil's
favourite song.

199
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,087
- Who's that?
- On the end, on that chair.

200
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,249
♪ Still longing for
the old plantation

201
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,170
♪ And for the old folks at home

202
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,884
Very good.

203
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,331
Well done.

204
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,802
The following children will
come forward. Tommy Grant.

205
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,007
This way, Tommy.

206
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,441
Come on. Stand up straight.

207
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,528
Whoa. Whoa, boy.

208
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,404
- What they doing now?
- Checking for the fair ones.

209
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,841
- Why?
- To take them to Sister Kate's.

210
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,760
They're more clever than us.
They can go to proper school.

211
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,882
Thank you. No.

212
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,848
Good boy.

213
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,404
Molly Craig.

214
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,648
That you.

215
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,203
- Molly Craig!
- Go on, get up.

216
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,848
Hurry up. They'll whip you.

217
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,724
Molly. Come on, dear.

218
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,410
Get up. Quick.

219
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,285
- Come on, young lady.
- They'll put you in the boob.

220
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,966
- Just Molly, please.
- Where you going? Come back.

221
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,923
- Sit down.
- Hurry up.

222
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,848
Come along.

223
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,848
It's all right.

224
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,088
That's the way.

225
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,964
Don't be afraid.

226
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,731
Come along.

227
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,684
- I'm not going to hurt you.
- See?

228
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,528
Bit further.

229
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,291
That's it.

230
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,880
It's Molly, isn't it?

231
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,241
I know it all feels
very strange,

232
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,570
but after a few days
you'll feel quite at home.

233
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,810
We're here to help and encourage
you in this new world.

234
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,890
Duty, service, responsibility -

235
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,168
those are our watchwords.

236
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,607
- Molly, keep still.
- It's all right.

237
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,965
No.

238
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,727
Sweep it over here.

239
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,881
To the door.

240
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,606
Come on, this way.

241
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,688
Push it towards me.

242
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,409
Hey, tracker girl.

243
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,842
Your dad's bringing
Olive back. He catched her.

244
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,168
Thank you, Moodoo.

245
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,884
There now, young lady.

246
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,447
Did you really think
you'd get away with it?

247
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,166
Now, stop that crying.
See what Miss Doyle has here?

248
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,921
Olive, look at me.
You see this here? The scissors?

249
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,563
Did she run away home?

250
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,808
She ran away
to see her boyfriend.

251
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,527
You should have thought
about this beforehand. Come on.

252
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,723
We'll see if those boys
find you so attractive now.

253
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,408
In you go.

254
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,288
Broke out through here.
Usual story.

255
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,448
Off to see her boyfriend.

256
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,771
- The tracker brought her back.
- Yes, Moodoo.

257
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,646
Mr Neal tells me that
your probation period is up

258
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,162
and that you wish to return to
the Kimberleys. Is that right?

259
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,371
Of course your daughter is here,
isn't she?

260
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,842
There would be
no question of her going.

261
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,282
She would have to stay here
and continue her training.

262
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,250
I think for the time being it
would be best for all concerned

263
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,125
if you were to remain here,
Moodoo.

264
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,370
I'd be prepared to consider your
case in a year or so, but...

265
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,050
until then...

266
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,929
Those babies.
Where are their mothers?

267
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,168
They got no mothers.

268
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,127
Nobody here got any mothers.

269
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,083
I got mother.

270
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,484
Come on, they're lining up.
Let's go.

271
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,488
Bad place.

272
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,891
Make me sick.

273
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,968
These people...

274
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,961
Sick.

275
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,728
Make me sick.

276
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,688
Come on, make your beds.

277
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,882
Nice and tidy.

278
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,004
If you've already done it,
get to the church now.

279
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,929
Hurry up.

280
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,407
Stop dawdling.

281
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,841
Molly, take the bucket out,

282
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,247
then the three of you
go to the church.

283
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,848
Come on, you kids,
get up there! You're late.

284
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,928
Hurry up.

285
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,811
Come on.
Get your things. We're going.

286
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,606
- Where are we going?
- Home. To mother.

287
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,806
How we gonna get there?

288
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,445
Walk.

289
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,721
We're not going. Are we, Daisy?
We like it here.

290
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,127
That tracker, he's going to
put us in that boob.

291
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,208
He's not going to
put us in the boob.

292
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,881
We just keep walking.
The rain will cover our tracks.

293
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,570
We've got to go now.

294
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,648
Come on. Quick.

295
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,368
Come on.

296
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,684
Come on, Gracie. Now.

297
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,043
- Too far, Molly.
- Hurry up!

298
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,924
♪ He made their tiny wings

299
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,802
♪ All things
bright and beautiful

300
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,481
♪ All creatures great and small

301
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,928
Come on. Let's go!

302
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,801
- Irene Clark.
- Here.

303
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,922
- Ellie Moodoo.
- Here.

304
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,327
Molly Craig.

305
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,408
Molly Craig.

306
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,088
Molly Craig.

307
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,810
Gracie Fields.

308
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,048
Daisy Kadibil.

309
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,251
Nina, have you seen
the new girls?

310
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,727
Haven't seen them all day, miss.

311
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,562
Mister! Mr Neville said you'd
better come real quick.

312
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,929
That's two days ago, Mr Neal.

313
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,362
Yes, I understand, but I require
to be kept fully informed.

314
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,048
Thank you. Goodbye.

315
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,526
Those three girls.
They've run off.

316
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,450
- Oh, dear.
- I blame the older one.

317
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,487
I wondered when I saw her.

318
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,286
Too much of their mind...
unfathomable.

319
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,808
The tracker's onto it. It must
be kept out of the papers.

320
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,650
- No rain. Tracker'll get us.
- Tracker's not gonna get us!

321
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,285
Come on.

322
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,126
We've got to keep going.
Come on, Gracie.

323
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,128
Daisy, give me your bag.

324
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,924
Give us your bag, quick.

325
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,603
Give us it!

326
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,368
Hurry up. In the water!
We need to go fast.

327
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,561
I see...

328
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,761
I see... the kangaroo. Red rock.

329
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,644
No.

330
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,003
I don't see nothing.
There's no food here.

331
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,566
- I see...
- You don't know this place.

332
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,728
How we gonna eat?

333
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,128
Run!

334
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,208
Quick, hide. Come on.

335
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,722
Ask them, Molly. Ask them if
they have something to eat.

336
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,008
You're from that
Moore River place, eh?

337
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,770
We’re going home.

338
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,564
Where your country?

339
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,689
- Jigalong.
- Jigalong?

340
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,768
Proper long way.

341
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,448
You know what you're doing?

342
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,088
That tracker from Moore River.

343
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,248
Him really good.

344
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,125
I heard he get them runaways
all the time.

345
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,481
Gotta be good to beat him.

346
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,524
Take you back to that place.
Here.

347
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,528
You watch out for him, eh?

348
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,888
You think you're so smart...

349
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,408
Where are we?

350
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,728
We're lost.

351
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,167
Jigalong that way. North.

352
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,130
Tracker followed them to...
this riverbank,

353
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,288
but lost their tracks
about a week ago.

354
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,482
There's been
no sign of them since.

355
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,568
Three little half-castes.

356
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,569
We're talking quite a few
man-hours.

357
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,966
Who's going to pay?

358
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,889
There's very little
in my budget.

359
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,970
If your men can combine this
with their regular duties...

360
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,082
We'll be able to handle
the notifications.

361
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,090
- Post police stations, farms.
- We'll provide a description.

362
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,771
But if my men have to make trips
outside of their duties

363
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,928
it'll be an impost
on your department.

364
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,011
If they are out on other jobs
there would be no extra expense.

365
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,804
I can see that.

366
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,447
And it is the job of every one
of your men as local Protectors.

367
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,847
My men will do their jobs,
Mr Neville.

368
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,040
- Now, a week ago, you said.
- Yes.

369
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,168
Hey, Maude. The girls have gone.

370
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,650
What'd you say?

371
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,162
They've run away from
Moore River. They're gone.

372
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,089
Everybody's looking for 'em.

373
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,209
And what do you think
you might be up to?

374
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,084
Thieving my eggs, eh?

375
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,885
You come out here
where I can see you. Come on.

376
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,927
Stand up. Out you come.

377
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,927
And get rid of that bread.
It's filthy.

378
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,609
You want something to eat,
you ask for it.

379
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,804
Come on.
I'm not going to bite you.

380
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,368
You're on your own?

381
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,848
Got anyone with you?

382
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,768
Where you girls
planning on going?

383
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,528
Cat got your tongue, eh?

384
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,368
Now get. Go on.

385
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,446
And watch out for those boys
further along.

386
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,291
They go out hunting rabbits
along the fence.

387
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,046
- That rabbit-proof fence?
- Yes, the rabbit-proof fence.

388
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,209
- Where that rabbit fence?
- East.

389
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,648
Which way now?

390
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,603
That way. That fence.

391
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,768
Find that rabbit fence,
we go home.

392
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,848
Then we see our mum.

393
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:11,445
"The Chief Protector of
Aborigines, Mr AO Neville...

394
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,642
The devil!

395
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,969
...Is concerned about
three native girls,

396
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:22,007
ranging from eight to fourteen
years of age, who a month ago

397
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,566
ran away from the Moore River
Native Settlement."

398
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:31,607
"He would be grateful
if any person who saw them

399
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,087
would notify him...

400
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,964
promptly.

401
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:40,449
"'We have been searching high
and low for the children

402
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,530
for a month past,'
added Mr Neville,

403
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,449
Devil!

404
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,245
'And all the trace we found
of them was a dead rabbit."'

405
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,128
It's the fence! Down there!

406
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,690
The latest sighting, which is
four days old, puts them...

407
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,485
- The man from the newspaper.
- I have nothing more to say.

408
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,568
May I have a look?

409
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,645
Now, Albany, yes?

410
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,604
Gilwarra. Yalgoo...

411
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,409
Dalwallinu...

412
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,568
Gilwarra, Yalgoo.

413
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:36,002
Dalwallinu, Gilwarra, Yalgoo.

414
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,209
They're on the fence.

415
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,041
They're following
the rabbit-proof fence.

416
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,525
Right!

417
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,168
Just because a people
use Neolithic tools

418
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,090
does not mean they have
Neolithic minds.

419
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,282
This makes our task
very much easier. Look.

420
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,244
There's a branch off here
to the west, north of Yalgoo.

421
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:05,287
You put your man out here on the
fence north of this junction.

422
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,051
He can start to come down it
to meet them,

423
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,881
while our Moodoo comes up
from the south behind them.

424
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,685
You can't miss them.

425
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,683
Where Daisy?

426
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,768
Wait here.

427
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,570
My legs, Molly.

428
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,648
They hurt. I can't walk.

429
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,362
I'm carrying you only once,
all right?

430
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,050
Come on.

431
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,128
Come on...

432
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,760
Don't think I'm carrying you
all the way.

433
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,608
Camp, Molly!

434
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,250
Company-

435
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,608
Where you girls headed?

436
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,247
Down to Mullewa?

437
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,328
You got family there?

438
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,810
- Where Mullewa?
- Mullewa?

439
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,440
West.

440
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,040
The way you're headed,
along the number two fence.

441
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,970
They got two rabbit-proof fence?

442
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,367
My oath. They got three of 'em.

443
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,564
We're on the wrong fence.

444
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,169
Where that north fence?

445
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,365
North fence? Back that way -
where you come from.

446
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,010
You can cut across.

447
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,691
I'll show you.
Number one rabbit fence.

448
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,889
Here's the number two fence.

449
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,809
Now you're here.

450
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,082
But you wanna be here.

451
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,726
Now, if you cut across here...

452
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,523
you save yourself
a hundred mile or so.

453
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,608
It's not hard.

454
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,968
I'm going back.

455
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,048
I don't have the petrol.

456
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,448
Over here.

457
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,250
And we're hungry.

458
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,328
Youse that lot from Moore River?

459
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,844
What, you girls
walk all that way?

460
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,605
800 miles?

461
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,089
I was there.

462
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,362
Too scared to run away, but...

463
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,008
Everyone was always caught,
stuck in that boob.

464
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,851
Youse got the furtherest.
Where you heading?

465
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,241
- Home.
- Mavis!

466
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,564
Stay here.
I'll come back and get you.

467
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,923
You can sleep with me tonight.
I'll get you some food.

468
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,087
Just getting the washing,
Mrs Evans!

469
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,489
What's that?

470
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,965
Someone coming.

471
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,847
Quick, in the bed.
Under the blankets.

472
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,722
What are you
playing at, Mavis?

473
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,610
Go away.

474
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,371
Come on, quick.
Get up. Come on.

475
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,168
Don't go, Molly.

476
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,128
Please don't go.

477
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,928
He come back if you go.

478
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,530
Don't go.

479
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,244
He won't say anything.

480
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,448
Please.

481
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,289
Hello, Evans.

482
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,970
Hello.

483
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,321
Quick, wake up!
Wake up! Got to go.

484
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,248
Let's have a look.

485
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,600
Run that way
and just keep going.

486
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,246
They were running out over
there. About an hour or so ago.

487
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,525
We'll pick up the tracks
in the morning.

488
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,007
I'll make a cup of tea.

489
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,491
That's the tracker.

490
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,168
Yeah, that's him.

491
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,528
Hop on.

492
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,604
I do not expect you
to understand

493
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,609
what I am trying to do
for these people,

494
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,087
but I will not have my plans
put into jeopardy.

495
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:51,046
The problem of half-castes
is not simply going to go away.

496
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,323
If not dealt with now, it will
fester for years to come.

497
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,442
These children are that problem.

498
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,881
Please explain
exactly what happened.

499
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,162
I don't know how they did it,
but we lost them.

500
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,931
I had Larsen out there,
Moodoo was with him -

501
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,690
and we lost them.

502
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,882
- They're making fools of us.
- They are indeed.

503
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,162
The cost is more than to
just our pride.

504
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,931
This department's reputation
is beginning to suffer.

505
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,122
I assure you,
my men have better things to do

506
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,687
than chase your charges
all around the country.

507
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:22,009
Now... they're coming into
very rough terrain.

508
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,728
Once they're much past
Meekatharra

509
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,569
I can't risk any of my men.

510
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:32,651
We must find them before they
get into real desert country.

511
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,683
So, this is what
we’re going to do.

512
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,371
You get your man up there.
Moodoo can join him.

513
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,642
Well up the fence,
around here.

514
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,411
Far enough up so we know
we cannot possibly miss them.

515
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,324
And I want them to stay there.

516
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,488
They can set up camp and wait.

517
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,728
Costly.

518
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,366
We'll just have to bear it.

519
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,448
Their lives may be at stake.

520
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,441
I understand the mother of one
of the girls has gone to Wiluna.

521
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:03,803
They're headed into that
country. I want the word spread.

522
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,809
Let's see what that does.

523
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,688
You wouldn't get me out there.

524
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,848
She's pretty clever, that girl.

525
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,808
She wants to go home.

526
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:49,048
Good thing you kids ran into me.

527
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,249
Lot of people worried for you.

528
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,727
Police up and down the country
looking for youse.

529
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,808
It's in all the papers.

530
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,328
Which one of you is Gracie?

531
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,290
You Gracie?

532
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,004
I hear your mummy in Wiluna.

533
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,600
You can catch a train there
from Meeka.

534
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,924
Come on. Let's go.

535
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,366
- Wiluna. She at Wiluna?
- Yes.

536
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,850
Come on, Gracie.

537
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:39,282
Don't listen to him.
He's a liar.

538
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:45,522
Maybe she's there, Molly.
Maybe he telling the truth.

539
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:59,328
Molly.

540
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,805
Let's go to Meeka.
Catch a train to Wiluna.

541
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,809
They see us, they'll catch us.

542
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,410
We can't stop now.
Got to keep going.

543
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,568
We're nearly there.

544
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,331
But Molly... mummy there.

545
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:21,041
She at Wiluna. I want mummy.

546
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,046
Come on.

547
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,128
Come on, Daisy.

548
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,008
Come on, Daisy.

549
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,648
You have to carry me, Molly.

550
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,168
Hop on.

551
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,448
She's not coming.

552
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:15,285
Don't look back. She'll come.

553
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,485
Higher.

554
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,847
You got 'em?

555
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,046
Three.
One for you, one for me...

556
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,128
And one for both of us.

557
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:25,601
Come on, Dais.
We’re going to wait for Gracie.

558
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,888
Go!

559
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:15,646
I've got her.

560
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,728
I want to get the train
to mummy!

561
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,921
Can you see him?

562
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,008
Oi! Trevor!

563
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,446
Thanks, Jackie. You'll get
your reward back at the station.

564
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,647
Taking you back
where you belong.

565
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:00,209
She gone, Molly.
She not coming back.

566
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,248
Needle in a haystack.

567
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,890
That's it.

568
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,651
Pack your stuff!
We're getting out of here.

569
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,888
They're only paying us
for three weeks.

570
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,769
To Constable Riggs,
police station, Nullagine.

571
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,611
The two missing half-caste girls
Molly and Daisy

572
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,803
are returning to Jigalong
via the rabbit-proof fence,

573
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:52,641
our efforts to apprehend them
thus far having come to naught.

574
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:55,331
I therefore expect them
to arrive in Jigalong

575
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,807
in about a month's time.

576
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,002
In your capacity
as local Protector

577
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:03,966
you are to proceed to Jigalong
to await their arrival

578
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,209
and effect their recapture.

579
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:09,243
Yours, etc.

580
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:30,890
No fence.

581
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,407
I want mother.

582
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,882
That fence'll come back.

583
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,808
Home.

584
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:18,041
It's coming through now.

585
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,481
"Riggs arrived Jigalong."

586
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,088
"Awaits your instructions."

587
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,601
Yes, there will be a reply.
Please wait.

588
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,365
"Girls to be send south
via Meekathara."

589
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,528
"To be accompanied
at all times."

590
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,448
"Awaiting notification."

591
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,405
What's all that about?

592
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,329
Just some women's business.

593
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,528
Been going on all day.

594
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,330
Hey, Molly?

595
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:08,728
That tracker.
He not gonna get us now.

596
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,649
No, he not gonna get us.

597
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,041
I'm not going to stay here.
I can feel it.

598
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,888
They're up to something.

599
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,848
I’m going to take a look.

600
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,686
I lost one.

601
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,689
I lost one.

602
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:18,488
To Constable Riggs,
police station, Nullagine.

603
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,524
At present we lack the funds

604
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:26,487
to pursue the missing half-caste
girls Molly and Daisy.

605
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:30,889
I would ask to be kept informed
of their whereabouts

606
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:37,690
so that at some future date
they may indeed be... recovered.

607
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:43,526
We face an uphill battle
with these people -

608
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:46,007
especially the bush natives,

609
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:49,920
who have to be protected
against themselves.

610
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,721
If they would only understand

611
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:58,767
what we are trying to do
for them.

612
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,842
Tsk! Yours, etc.

613
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,849
Thank you.

614
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,681
<i>We walked for nine weeks,</i>

616
