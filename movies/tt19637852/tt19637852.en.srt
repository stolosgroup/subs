It was clear that the NFL
was having public image concerns

217
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,683
about racial representation.

218
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,852
So the commissioner
brought in Roc Nation to advise.

219
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,941
It was actually really late
for them to pick a performer.

I don't know. I don't know anything yet.

223
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,785
There's a rumor that you might perform
at the halftime show.

224
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,703
Yeah. [laughs]

The Super Bowl is the biggest stage
in entertainment. Period, bar none.

227
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,921

I don't know. I don't know.

[Hoda Kotb] Okay! That was not a "no."

It's in Miami. They want a Latina.

[Benny] Typically, you have
one headliner at a Super Bowl.

240
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,214
That headliner constructs the show.

241
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,593
Um, and should they choose
to have other guests,

242
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,011
that's their choice.

243
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:48,476
It was an insult to say
you needed two Latinas

244

to do the job
that one artist historically has done.

245
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,864
Let me get...
let me get that little handkerchief.

246

this morning...

247
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,076
- [Jennifer] Uh-huh.
- ...and said that Shakira had called.

248
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,829
And she was, uh, very sort of up

249
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:13,334
and very open to the idea
of the... of the double intro

250
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:17,254
and had a couple of ideas
she actually really wants to throw out...

251
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:21,884
The more we can kind of, like, know
what each other's thinking...

252
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:22,843
[Benny] Yeah.

253
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,930
...the easier it's gonna be
and the more at ease we'll both be.

254
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,533
- [Shakira] <i>Hello.</i>
- [Jennifer] Hi, baby. How are you?

255
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,726
[Shakira] <i>Good, good. Are you working?</i>

256
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,729
I did a night shoot last night,
so I'm just waking up.

257
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,731
- [laughs]
<i>- </i>[Shakira]<i> Oh my God.</i>

258
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,358
<i>I don't know how you do it.</i>

259
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:42,404
<i>Listen, I know that the Super Bowl people
want us to be weaved throughout the show.</i>

260
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:46,325
<i>I haven't had a confirmation
about how many minutes I'm gonna have.</i>

261
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,995
Okay. Okay, let me address that
really quick. They said 12 minutes.

262
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,333
I got kind of a good confirmation that...

263
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,545
[chuckles] ...we could have
an extra minute or two.

264
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,839
So now we're at, like, 13, 14 minutes.

265
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,401
I think, Shakira, what we should have is
you should have half the time, and I...

266
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,265
[Shakira]<i> 13, 14 minutes
between the two of us?</i>

267
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,680
<i>- </i>No... Yeah...
- [Shakira] <i>In general? Ah, okay. Yeah.</i>

268
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:08,806
For the whole show.

269
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,892
If it was gonna be a double headliner,
they should've given us 20 minutes.

270
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,776
[laughs] You know what I mean?
That's what they should've fucking done.

271
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,314
There's an amazing opportunity here

272
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,441
to show who we are as performers

273
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,028
but also show who we are as a community
and also show the...

274
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,697
Bring the world together.

275
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,199
We can bring everybody together
in this moment.

[pensive music playing]

277
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,580
There's a lot at stake for me
as a Super Bowl performer.

278
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,500
You get to not just show people
what you do as an artist,

279
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:40,045
but you also have this opportunity
to say something bigger.

280
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,964
You write so many songs about love.

281
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,591
- [Jennifer] Oh Lord.
- How many?

282
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,135
- All of them are about love.
- [Hoda] All of them. Yeah.

283
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,847
Some people write about politics
and social issues and... [laughs]

284
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,098
[Hoda] No, thank you.

285
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,811
[Jennifer] I'm not into politics.
I'm not that person,

286
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,901
but I was living in a United States
that I didn't recognize.

287
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,573
I was afraid for my kids,
for their future.

288
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:09,992
[crowd] Build that wall!

289
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,744
Build that wall!

290

[crowd] No more walls!

292
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,667

00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,495
There's just certain things
as a human being you don't do.

307
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,749
What is my message,
and what do I stand for?

308
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:04,546
It made me realize that I have
a responsibility to not be quiet,

309
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:09,510
to not... just leave the politics
to everybody else.

310
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:17,309
"This year's Super Bowl halftime show
is a statement to a divided country,

311
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,229
declaring the importance of kindness,
inclusivity, and compassion,

312
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,941
a reminder that we're always stronger,
always better together."

"Shakira and Jennifer together
for the first time in Miami

that does just that."

315
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,700
I told her to start thinking
about what she wants that last song to be.

316
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,577
She wasn't crazy about "Born in the USA."

317
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,539
I'm not 100% convinced,
so I couldn't convince her.

318
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,182
She's like, "I wasn't born in the USA."

319
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,876
I said, "Yeah, but everybody loves
to sing that song."

320
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,464
And when America is at its best,
everybody wants to live in America.

321
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:51,260
You also have the right to come here
because we're a country of immigrants.

322
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,344
That's who we are.

326
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,603
That's... that's big. That's big.

327
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,087
Because these motherfuckers
act like everybody's an immigrant

328
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,984
who's trying to sneak into the country
and who's a criminal.

329
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:10,529
'Cause that's the narrative Trump created,
which is bullshit.

330
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,448
Some of us have been here for years.

331
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,868
A lot of those people are just good people
who are looking for the American dream.

00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,036
That's all they want.

333
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,165
But like I told her, I said if you come up
with a better song and a better cameo

334
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:24,418
to make the statement
that we shouldn't be hating on each other...

there was a better life here.

Growing up,

373
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:27,040
I was surrounded by strong,

powerful,

My mom and my grandmother and my aunt,
they ran shit. That was it.

They just... they were in charge.

[Lupe] David and I moved to the Bronx.

379
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,056
It was a fourth-floor walk-up,

380
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,975
and it only had one bedroom.

381
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,644
I had my three daughters
in that apartment.

382
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:53,567
My mom, she's a super complicated person,
and she carries a lot of baggage.

383
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,861
Her generation was,

384
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,488
"A man will come along
and marry you and take care of you

385
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,657
for the rest of your life
and provide for you."

386
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:04,036
And she had a lot bigger dreams than that.

387
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,954
She dreamt of being an actress.

388
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,208
She wanted us to be independent.

389
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:13,003
Like, "I don't want you guys to ever have
to depend on a man for anything."

390
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:17,049
I always had
the highest expectations of them.

391
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,967
It wasn't to be critical.

392
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,011
It was just to show you
that you could do better.

393
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,057
And Jennifer, she gave me
the hardest time, tell you the truth.

394
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,309
You know, we butted heads a lot.

395

[Jennifer] She did
what she had to do to survive,

396
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,232
and it made her strong,

397
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,859
but it also made her tough.

I did with their best interest at heart.

I'm really grateful for my mom and dad

405
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,469
because they taught me
to do everything on my own.

And I live with those voices in my head.

As a young performer,

408
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,900
every job that I got I did

409
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,654
because there were so many in between
that I didn't get.

410
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,658
Good roles for women of color
were very limited,

411
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:27,369
but I just kept grinding and believing

412
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,372
that somehow, someway,
I would get that shot.

00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,557
with an amazing stage presence
of a superstar.

419
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,685
And, unfortunately, at 23 years old,

420
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,479
she was gunned down
by the head of her fan club.

421
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,150
It's important to the Latino community
because we haven't had

00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,360
any big role models in Hollywood.

609
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,288
[doctor] Well, I think
you've got an upper respiratory.

610

Maybe we should start you on
something now.

612

[Jennifer] I've been a little depressed.
I'm not gonna lie.

613
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,755
I think that took my immune system down.

I've just been working long hours,
and I'm away from the kids.

It all just makes me a little bit sad.

616
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,014
[doctor] Well, you've got
three and a half full-time careers.

00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,433
- Yeah.
- [doctor] So it's not only one of those.

- [Jennifer] Please.

621

- No, you can remind me at Christmas.
- Okay.

622

- I haven't seen a movie in two years.

[audience cheers]

643
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,656
[Jimmy] It's you and Shakira.
How much time do you have to...

644
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,407
Halftime is like 29 minutes exactly,

645
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:35,244
so they have to put up the stage,
we perform and then take down the stage.

646
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:40,041
So you wind up having
anywhere between, like, 12 and 14 minutes.

647
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,627
And so we're probably gonna split that
between us

648
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,046
and then have
some great guests, hopefully,

649
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,756
and, you know, things like that.

650
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,776
- [Jimmy] It's a big deal.
- [Jennifer] Thank you.

the halftime at the Super Bowl,"

669
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,646
the first thing... [chuckles]
...of course, that comes to my head is,

670
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,442
how am I editing
all of these hits? [chuckles]

671
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,527
We have six fucking minutes.

672

We have 30 seconds of a song if we want.

But there's got to be certain songs
that we sing, though.

This is the worst idea in the world,
to have two people do the Super Bowl.

00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,565
that my daughter could sing
"Born in the USA" in the finale.

853

I'd been trying to get Bruce Springsteen
to do that cameo.

854
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,903
But then I thought
it's so much more powerful

855
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:56,407
if Emme sings "Born in the USA,"
as a little, young Latina girl.

856
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,910
And then if they were connected
at the top, it could open up,

more complicated.

912
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:03,135
[Lorene] Maybe because she's made
hard work look so effortless for so long,

913
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,971
it's easy
to take Jennifer Lopez for granted.

914
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:08,891
I'm so proud she's getting
the recognition she deserves.

00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,736
I was offered an opportunity
to shine a light on women

918
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:24,490
who are usually spinning
on the periphery of the action.

919
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:29,077
Ramona was a mass of contradictions,
a female character with the type of depth

920
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,955
that is usually reserved
for men in Hollywood.

this is gonna be so scary,

930
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,895
all of these award shows for me.
I'm gonna be like...

931
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:59,024
It... it's... it's nerve-racking
in a way that I cannot explain.

932
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:04,196
And I already knew I got the award,
and I was still like... [breathes shakily]

- [woman] Bless you.
- [man] Thank you.

934

who I've been watching

and I've never been that person.

who has the biggest hit of her career

938
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,469
a woman who embraces
the power of her sexuality

939
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:30,931
and turns the way women are objectified
on its head.

- [Jennifer] Hi, guys.

941
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,309
- How are you?
- [woman 2] Good.

942
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:37,396
[Jennifer] I wanted to put all of that
onto that Super Bowl stage.

Radio Mix)" by Jennifer Lopez playing]

We were doing <i>Hustlers</i> prep in LA,

945
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:47,406
and I brought my silicone pole
that had that rubber coating.

946
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:50,325
- You can wear clothes. It's a nonissue.
- [Jennifer] Yeah.

947
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,369
I'm already thinking at the gym, I'm like,

948
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:55,831
if you have to not wear tights
for this part, you know what I mean?

949
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:58,709
And then do a change after Balvin
and put something on.

950
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:01,753
You know, we could light it in a way
where I'm just bare-legged.

951
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:02,713
[Johanna] Mm-hmm.

952
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:06,216
It's just a big deal to be up there
with all those lights with no fucking...

[Johanna] Mm-hmm.

[Johanna] Do it, guys.

959
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,775
I think, sometimes, as women, we think,

00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,612
"If I'm too sexy,
I won't be taken seriously."

They can all coexist

964
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,295
and be very authentic and real.

965

I went out there the first week.
One of the girls comes up to me,

and she's like, "You know that photo shoot
we were supposed to do?"

"They postponed it. They're waiting
for you to lose a little weight."

Excuse me?

972

When I started working,
the beauty ideal was very thin,

In all the movies I do,

976

they're always trying
to minimize the hip area.

977

[pensive music playing]

1263
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:43,634
One of the things I'm proud of

and the journey that I've been on,
I had to learn that the key

1269
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:06,949
was not so much about other people
but about yourself.

1270
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,869
It's about being your own keeper

1271

and not looking for somebody

I'm also Puerto Rican.

[Jennifer] We left rehearsal,

1530
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:12,794
and I... I noticed everybody's
kinda freaking out, but I don't know why.

1531
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:14,755
And I get a call

1532
01:17:15,547 --> 01:17:16,882
from Benny,

1533
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:19,760
and he's like,
"They wanna pull the cages."

1534
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:25,432
That night, the higher-ups at the NFL
saw it for the first time,

1535
01:17:25,515 --> 01:17:28,435
and they're like,
"Hey, you can't do that."

1536
01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:32,189
The NFL had a real concern
about making a political statement

1537
01:17:32,272 --> 01:17:33,272
about immigration.

1538
01:17:34,691 --> 01:17:37,444
They looked at the plans,
and the message was absolute.

1539
01:17:37,944 --> 01:17:40,405
They did not want those cages in the show.

1540
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:44,368
That had come down
from the highest authority.

1541

Highest authority.

1542

[dramatic music playing]

1543
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:03,637
[Jennifer] For me,
this isn't about politics.

1544
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:07,265
This is about human rights.

1545
01:18:09,142 --> 01:18:12,104
I'm facing the biggest crossroads
of my life, you know,

1546
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:16,441
to be able to perform
on the world's biggest stage.

1547
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:20,612
But to take out the cages
and sacrifice what I believe in

1548
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:23,615
would be like never being there at all.

1549
01:18:26,993 --> 01:18:29,430
There was a part of me
that just got very zen, and I was like,

1550
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:32,624
"Benny, I don't care what you have to do.
We're not changing the show."

1551
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:36,545
The Super Bowl is tomorrow,
and we're not changing anything.

1552
01:18:41,174 --> 01:18:43,427
I've been thinking about the Super Bowl

1553
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:47,097
probably since I started
recording records in 1999.

01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:52,185
and different than what I thought
it was gonna be,

1556
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:56,481
Parris said, in one of the rehearsals,
it takes you through a gamut of emotions.

1557
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,775
It takes you
on a high-energy, beautiful ride

01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:00,444
where you feel so many things.

Parris, she's a perfectionist,

1560
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:03,905
but I think every single one of you

1561
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:06,241
right now is a better dancer
because of her.
