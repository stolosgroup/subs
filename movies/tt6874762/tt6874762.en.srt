3
00:00:55,524 --> 00:00:56,931
Are we going up there?

4
00:00:57,027 --> 00:00:58,084
Yeah, no, you are.

5
00:00:58,116 --> 00:01:00,515
We're gonna stay down the
bottom and have lunch.

6
00:01:00,996 --> 00:01:02,435
Hey, don't touch the driver.

7
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,491
Yes, there kind of is.

8
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,324
No, there's not.

9
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,531
OK, they don't
hire the prostitutes.

10
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:10,211
- It's nothing that I listen to.
- Yeah.

11
00:01:10,242 --> 00:01:11,588
I listen to the old classics.

12
00:01:11,684 --> 00:01:13,219
"The old classics"?

13
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:15,042
- Playboi Carti is...
- It's political.

14
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:15,844
It's political.

15
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,436
Playboi Carti is not
an old classic.

16
00:01:18,468 --> 00:01:19,268
I don't listen to him.

17
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,156
I listen to the old...
It's political.

18
00:01:21,188 --> 00:01:24,068
"I don't listen to him."
"I don't listen to him."

19
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,795
<i>It's just so...</i>

20
00:01:25,827 --> 00:01:29,699
<i>You know, they have one song.
They're, like, four min... no,</i>

21
00:01:29,796 --> 00:01:30,980
<i>It's, like, eight minutes, say.</i>

22
00:01:31,011 --> 00:01:31,940
<i>It's pretty.</i>

23
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:35,202
<i>And it just goes...</i>

24
00:01:35,235 --> 00:01:37,219
<i>That's so vibe-y.</i>

25
00:01:37,251 --> 00:01:39,075
<i>And not in a good way.</i>

26
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:40,962
<i>It's like if you just took...</i>

27
00:01:40,995 --> 00:01:43,524
<i>OK, if you look up
on the right here,</i>

28
00:01:43,556 --> 00:01:47,811
you will see the site that, uh...

29
00:01:49,124 --> 00:01:50,691
You passed a speed trap,
Hoaggie.

30
00:01:50,787 --> 00:01:51,619
What?

31
00:01:51,651 --> 00:01:53,475
- You passed a speed trap.
- Oh, shit.

32
00:01:54,884 --> 00:01:58,211
They just don't
have any talent.

33
00:01:58,242 --> 00:01:59,780
Yeah, but if we're
talking about lyrics,

34
00:01:59,811 --> 00:02:01,379
some people do have
lots of talent.

35
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,332
- Yeah. But that's...
- In the way they deliver it.

36
00:02:03,428 --> 00:02:05,891
Well, they had some.

37
00:02:05,922 --> 00:02:07,939
No, but your
music is just noise.

38
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:09,411
<i>It's just lots of noise.</i>

39
00:02:09,444 --> 00:02:11,331
<i>It's not arranged.
It's not in order.</i>

40
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:12,932
<i>It's the same sequence...</i>

41
00:02:13,124 --> 00:02:15,651
Excuse me, sir. Do you realize
how fast you were going?

42
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:16,804
No, no, no.

43
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:20,804
But to say that
their music is bad

44
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,811
is different than saying that
you don't like their music.

45
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:25,731
I don't like them,
and they're just bad.

46
00:02:25,764 --> 00:02:28,452
OK, well, you don't know
anything about the real world.

47
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:30,308
I'm going to hit that phone
out of your hand.

48
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,971
No, you're not.

49
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,635
Oh, real mature.

50
00:02:33,795 --> 00:02:34,755
Hey!

51
00:02:37,028 --> 00:02:38,948
Do you think I'm kidding?

52
00:02:48,804 --> 00:02:50,243
Hey, how do you, um...

53
00:02:51,684 --> 00:02:53,316
Tap to make a jump.

54
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:55,811
All right, there you go.

55
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:13,091
<i>Hey, Hoaggie?</i>

56
00:03:13,412 --> 00:03:14,724
<i>No, you've already eaten.</i>

57
00:03:14,756 --> 00:03:17,219
Yeah, but it's part of
the road trip experience.

58
00:03:17,444 --> 00:03:18,755
"The road trip experience..."

59
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:20,099
All right, sure,
pass it here.

60
00:03:22,148 --> 00:03:23,939
No, no, no, you can just
share this one.

61
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:26,659
I'll tell you what, if you can
communicate with me

62
00:03:26,691 --> 00:03:29,732
in a mature, adult level,
I will concede.

63
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,322
All right, suit yourself.

64
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:33,891
They're two for $3.15.

65
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:55,748
<i>A hundred bottles
of beer on the wall,</i>

66
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:57,668
<i>a hundred bottles of beer.</i>

67
00:03:57,924 --> 00:04:00,162
<i>Take one down, pass it around.</i>

68
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,212
<i>99 bottles of beer on the wall.</i>

69
00:04:03,172 --> 00:04:04,259
That's not in order.

70
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:06,148
- We'll do it in rounds.
- No, please, no.

71
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,332
- We'll do it in rounds.
- Please, no.

72
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:08,292
No, you love that.

73
00:04:08,324 --> 00:04:09,762
- I hate that.
- You love that.

74
00:04:09,795 --> 00:04:10,755
Let's do rounds.

75
00:04:44,548 --> 00:04:45,315
It fascinates me, you know?

76
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:48,740
You get two eggs
from the same basket,

77
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:52,196
and one of them
is this lovely, gentle,

78
00:04:52,228 --> 00:04:54,882
patient boy
and the other one's...

79
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:57,860
What?

80
00:04:57,892 --> 00:04:58,979
An egg?

81
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:01,475
Yeah.

82
00:05:18,212 --> 00:05:19,203
Knock, knock.

83
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,163
Who's there?

84
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:21,348
Banana.

85
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,852
Banana, who?

86
00:05:22,883 --> 00:05:24,195
Knock, knock.

87
00:05:24,803 --> 00:05:25,859
Who's there?

88
00:05:25,956 --> 00:05:26,692
Banana.

89
00:05:26,723 --> 00:05:27,939
Banana, who?

90
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:28,995
Knock, knock.

91
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:30,819
- Who's there?
- Banana.

92
00:05:30,948 --> 00:05:31,875
Banana, who?

93
00:05:31,971 --> 00:05:33,186
Knock, knock.

94
00:05:33,764 --> 00:05:34,692
Who's there?

95
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:36,388
- Orange.
- Orange, who?

96
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:37,955
Orange you glad
I didn't say banana?

97
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:42,755
<i>That's just terrible.</i>

98
00:05:44,132 --> 00:05:45,348
I don't suck.

99
00:05:46,052 --> 00:05:47,268
You do suck, bro.

100
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,019
<i>You suck.
You suck more.</i>

101
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:51,395
<i>I'm not "who's there."</i>

102
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:52,932
- <i>Knock, knock.</i>
- <i>Who's there?</i>

103
00:05:52,964 --> 00:05:54,467
- Doctor.
- Doctor, who?

104
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,460
Ah!

105
00:06:31,268 --> 00:06:33,059
Hey, I don't want a photo
of your bums.

106
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:40,772
OK!

107
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:41,572
OK.

108
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:42,659
'K, 'K, 'K, 'K, 'K.

109
00:06:42,756 --> 00:06:43,588
Go.

110
00:06:57,731 --> 00:06:59,012
What are you thinking about?

111
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:01,155
Ah, just work.

112
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:02,819
<i>They just don't have any...</i>

113
00:07:02,852 --> 00:07:04,164
You boys enjoying the view?

114
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:05,699
<i>Yeah, it's great.</i>

115
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:07,492
<i>I'm talking about...</i>

116
00:07:07,523 --> 00:07:09,507
Jenny's still giving me
the third degree.

117
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:11,588
Oh, the Coromandel thing,
the shared batch thing.

118
00:07:11,684 --> 00:07:12,675
I want the boys
to have a place

119
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,875
to spend their summers
with a sense of community.

120
00:07:15,971 --> 00:07:17,316
We're OK with not having that.

121
00:07:17,412 --> 00:07:20,451
Yeah, I'm personally not
craving a sense of community.

122
00:07:20,548 --> 00:07:22,148
And what about the obligatory
committee meetings

123
00:07:22,244 --> 00:07:24,068
the politics, the passive
aggression?

124
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:25,700
- Alan.
- No, I'm serious.

125
00:07:25,732 --> 00:07:27,395
I had to organize
a fundraiser with Jenny

126
00:07:27,523 --> 00:07:29,284
and it was impossible.

127
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,819
- I got so angry...
- Alan.

128
00:07:30,915 --> 00:07:32,420
Well, I almost said something.

129
00:07:43,972 --> 00:07:44,932
Can we help you?

130
00:07:52,964 --> 00:07:53,955
This is nice.

131
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:57,668
Very nice.

132
00:07:57,763 --> 00:07:59,363
Is this a family picnic, man?

133
00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:07,843
I should probably introduce
myself, shouldn't I?

134
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:10,148
I'm Mandrake.

135
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,051
And you are...?

136
00:08:19,396 --> 00:08:20,387
Oh, I'm...

137
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,467
I'm Alan and this
is my wife Jill.

138
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:24,323
G'day, Alan.
G'day, Jill.

139
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,299
Who you got there?

140
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:29,443
Thompson and Thompson?

141
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,348
Um, this is Jordan,
and Maika.

142
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:35,108
Hey, boys.

143
00:08:37,028 --> 00:08:37,988
Oof.

144
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:40,451
Far out, eh?

145
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,619
Got the whole place
to yourselves.

146
00:08:49,123 --> 00:08:51,267
Privacy is a strange thing,
isn't it, eh?

147
00:08:53,187 --> 00:08:56,484
I mean, here we are
a world apart,

148
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:59,203
yet even as we speak,

149
00:08:59,235 --> 00:09:02,723
we got internet, radio waves
running right through us.

150
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:11,556
Nah, I can't hear anything
out this way.

151
00:09:16,996 --> 00:09:17,956
Mom...

152
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:19,363
It's OK, Maika.

153
00:09:25,827 --> 00:09:27,171
They can't hear us.

154
00:09:27,908 --> 00:09:29,476
And we can't hear them.

155
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:32,739
They got no idea
we're even alive.

156
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:39,875
See you're curious
about the gun.

157
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:41,827
Do you boys
want to take a look at it?

158
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,323
- You stay away from...
- Tut-tut-tut-tut, dad.

159
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:45,731
No need to get
jumpy there, mate.

160
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:46,947
Just trying to
make conversation.

161
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:48,067
Why don't you sit down, dad?

162
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:56,931
Mom...

163
00:09:57,924 --> 00:09:59,427
Maika, look at me.

164
00:10:00,196 --> 00:10:00,771
It's OK.

165
00:10:00,804 --> 00:10:02,083
You just stay there.

166
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:03,011
You're all right.

167
00:10:03,043 --> 00:10:04,131
Good on you, mum.

168
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:08,675
As long as everyone does
as they're told,

169
00:10:09,219 --> 00:10:11,076
this will all be over
in no time, eh?

170
00:10:11,395 --> 00:10:12,259
What do you want?

171
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:14,916
Well, thank you so much
for asking me, Jill.

172
00:10:15,012 --> 00:10:16,611
I take it that
fine family vehicle

173
00:10:16,643 --> 00:10:18,787
I saw just over the bridge
there belongs to you lot.

174
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:21,891
GPS, three tiered seating,
those fancy little cup holders.

175
00:10:21,924 --> 00:10:24,452
Here, just take it.
Just please...

176
00:10:24,547 --> 00:10:26,243
Well, thank you so much.

177
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:29,379
Would you mind turning out your
pockets while you're at it?

178
00:10:39,075 --> 00:10:40,131
Beautiful.

179
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:49,379
Yeah, I'm no
mathematician but, um...

180
00:10:49,603 --> 00:10:51,299
We made him leave
his phone at home.

181
00:10:51,332 --> 00:10:54,339
He's still grounded,
technically.

182
00:10:56,803 --> 00:10:58,691
That's probably
very wise, dad.

183
00:11:00,771 --> 00:11:01,540
You gotta teach 'em
to respect you

184
00:11:01,571 --> 00:11:03,747
before they can
respect themselves.

185
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:08,899
All right, if you could just all
pop yourselves down

186
00:11:08,931 --> 00:11:10,563
on the blanket over there,
heads facing that way,

187
00:11:10,596 --> 00:11:12,067
that'd be much appreciated.

188
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:19,139
In your own time.

189
00:11:22,979 --> 00:11:24,611
Boys, just come here.

190
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,019
Do exactly what he says, OK?

191
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:30,756
Come on. Let's just do what
you're told, OK?

192
00:11:48,228 --> 00:11:49,603
OK, we're gonna head off.

193
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:52,643
Don't turn around now.

194
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:54,596
It's OK.
Come on.

195
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:01,507
Hoaggie.

196
00:12:02,436 --> 00:12:03,652
What was that?
What'd you say?

197
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:05,060
It's just...

198
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,276
- What?
- No, just...

199
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:07,107
Hey, what'd you say?

200
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:08,452
They call me...
It's just a nickname.

201
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:10,275
- What's the nickname?
- Hoaggie.

202
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:25,347
Hoaggenraad.

203
00:12:26,276 --> 00:12:26,885
Am I pronouncing it correctly,
Hoaggenraad?

204
00:12:26,915 --> 00:12:28,483
Yeah, that's... that's right.

205
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,987
Can't be too many
of those around.

206
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,236
- It's Dutch.
- Interesting name.

207
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:32,900
Yeah, as interesting
as Mandrake?

208
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:36,803
I'm a magician.

209
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,779
I make things disappear.

210
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:42,275
Let me look at you.

211
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:43,779
Hey?

212
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:48,131
Hoaggenraad.

213
00:13:01,123 --> 00:13:02,563
Hoaggie!

214
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,419
I like it.
I like Hoaggie.

215
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,315
It's friendly.

216
00:13:05,347 --> 00:13:08,451
And, um, yeah,
actually I know a Hoaggie.

217
00:13:08,964 --> 00:13:10,340
Where do I know the
name Hoaggie from?

218
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:11,139
Oh, I don't know.

219
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:12,260
Yeah, come on,
you must know, man.

220
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,379
- I really don't.
- Come on.

221
00:13:13,411 --> 00:13:15,140
I usually have such a good
memory for this stuff, too.

222
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:16,356
Jill, where do I know
Hoaggie from?

223
00:13:16,387 --> 00:13:17,060
I'm not sure.

224
00:13:17,987 --> 00:13:19,203
Hey, Tubs, mate,
where have I heard the name

225
00:13:19,236 --> 00:13:20,675
Hoaggie from before?

226
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:22,915
I know it's...
Ah, come on, Hoaggie.

227
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:25,123
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

228
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:32,836
Hey.

229
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:34,756
Got company.

230
00:13:50,116 --> 00:13:51,747
All right, everybody up.
Everybody up.

231
00:13:51,843 --> 00:13:52,643
Come on.
Up, up, up, up, up, up.

232
00:13:52,675 --> 00:13:54,500
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Sh, sh, sh.

233
00:13:54,595 --> 00:13:55,683
Up, up, up.
Up, up.

234
00:13:55,716 --> 00:13:56,676
Get up.

235
00:13:58,499 --> 00:13:59,459
Good boy.

236
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:02,211
All right, everybody.
Play at happy campers, there.

237
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,131
Happy campers.

238
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:42,820
Mom.

239
00:14:43,491 --> 00:14:44,772
Eyes on them, mate.

240
00:14:56,388 --> 00:14:57,252
Okay, let's not be rude.

241
00:14:57,284 --> 00:14:59,236
Everybody give 'em a wave.
Give 'em a wave.

242
00:14:59,939 --> 00:15:00,899
Don't be rude.

243
00:15:08,547 --> 00:15:11,267
You know, later on, when you're
looking back at this occasion...

244
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:13,411
I think that right
there is going

245
00:15:13,443 --> 00:15:15,588
to be the moment you wish
you had done something.

246
00:15:41,123 --> 00:15:42,883
What the fuck have you done?!
What the fuck have you done?!

247
00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:57,764
When the sun goes down,
we'll make a move.

248
00:15:59,588 --> 00:16:00,644
Getting cold.

249
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:03,620
Yes, but tonight we don't have
to be out in it, do we?

250
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:04,995
Which makes a nice change.

251
00:16:07,171 --> 00:16:08,899
Tell you what,
why don't you go, um,

252
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:12,068
take those kids,
put 'em somewhere.

253
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,956
Food's not going anywhere.

254
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:29,059
Don't suppose you've got
any booze, do you, old son?

255
00:16:30,883 --> 00:16:31,843
Ah.

256
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:33,316
No?

257
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:34,308
Jill?

258
00:16:36,356 --> 00:16:37,731
What a pity.

259
00:17:28,036 --> 00:17:29,571
Fuck you!

260
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:32,195
Fuck you!

261
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,891
Fuck you all!

262
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:39,075
Fuck you...

263
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:45,252
You just never, never,
never, never, never know

264
00:17:45,284 --> 00:17:47,268
where the day is
gonna take you, eh?

265
00:17:48,642 --> 00:17:49,602
Hoaggie?

266
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:53,091
You see, I didn't wake up
this morning thinking,

267
00:17:53,124 --> 00:17:54,852
"Oh, this is where I'll be
by this evening,"

268
00:17:54,884 --> 00:17:57,251
and yet here we are.

269
00:18:00,804 --> 00:18:02,339
What've we got here...

270
00:18:04,131 --> 00:18:06,851
"Jill Marama Booth."

271
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,156
Fascinating.

272
00:18:09,348 --> 00:18:10,979
Kept her name.

273
00:18:11,939 --> 00:18:13,988
Bit bloody modern,
don't you reckon?

274
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:15,876
You better kill me
really quickly because

275
00:18:15,908 --> 00:18:17,571
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

276
00:19:51,555 --> 00:19:53,859
Yeah, I reckon I might drive
for a little bit, eh?

277
00:19:54,915 --> 00:19:57,155
Why don't you, uh, sit
in the back with Hoaggie?

278
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:00,035
Just thought of a
change of plans.

279
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:01,379
A quick detour.

280
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:05,348
<i>Come on.</i>

281
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,507
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey.

282
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,532
Shh.

283
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:22,659
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

284
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,842
Yeah, I can live with this.

285
00:20:44,004 --> 00:20:45,795
All right. Let's buckle up,
everyone.

286
00:20:53,475 --> 00:20:54,980
Where are you taking us?

287
00:20:57,348 --> 00:20:58,371
Home.

288
00:21:57,795 --> 00:21:59,363
It's a damn shame.

289
00:22:01,156 --> 00:22:04,100
It is amazing how
just a little bit of music

290
00:22:04,132 --> 00:22:05,475
can lighten the mood.

291
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:38,115
How's the philosophy,
old son?

292
00:22:38,531 --> 00:22:40,386
I'm guessing you probably
wouldn't know it to look at me,

293
00:22:40,483 --> 00:22:41,859
but I'm actually a bit
of a sort of sucker

294
00:22:41,892 --> 00:22:43,266
when it comes to reading.

295
00:22:46,276 --> 00:22:48,066
Reckon I would have done
all right at university, too,

296
00:22:48,163 --> 00:22:50,180
if things had been different.

297
00:22:53,604 --> 00:22:56,228
You know, not to knock
your profession, but...

298
00:22:56,324 --> 00:22:59,076
I just think that every lesson
you can be taught

299
00:22:59,172 --> 00:23:01,892
will occur in the course
of your life anyway, you know?

300
00:23:06,371 --> 00:23:07,748
Something I've been sitting
on for a while.

301
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:09,283
I want to get your take on it.

302
00:23:21,475 --> 00:23:23,876
Not safe to leave a driver alone
to his thoughts, Hoaggie.

303
00:23:28,643 --> 00:23:30,788
"Not to knock my profession."

304
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:32,868
Is that a question?

305
00:23:33,795 --> 00:23:36,035
I didn't tell you
I was a teacher.

306
00:23:37,252 --> 00:23:39,011
You are a teacher
though, right?

307
00:23:41,348 --> 00:23:43,332
Pretty certain you told me
at some point.

308
00:23:43,364 --> 00:23:44,324
But you're probably having
a bit of trouble

309
00:23:44,355 --> 00:23:45,763
remembering, you know?

310
00:23:46,723 --> 00:23:49,603
The shock of it all.

311
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:21,668
Dirt.

312
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:22,628
No.

313
00:24:23,236 --> 00:24:24,163
Dark.

314
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:24,995
No.

315
00:24:25,283 --> 00:24:26,436
Dust.

316
00:24:26,468 --> 00:24:28,131
Same as dirt.

317
00:24:28,931 --> 00:24:30,051
Desert.

318
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:31,107
No.

319
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:32,067
No, come on.

320
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:33,827
Um, ta, ta.

321
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,843
Um, driver?
Me?

322
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,475
No.

323
00:24:37,571 --> 00:24:38,115
No?

324
00:24:38,275 --> 00:24:39,556
I give up.

325
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:42,275
Distance.

326
00:24:42,371 --> 00:24:43,396
Eh?

327
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:44,676
Distance.

328
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:45,668
Yeah, no, I heard you
the first time, Tubs.

329
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:47,203
I don't think that's...

330
00:24:47,683 --> 00:24:49,123
That's a bit bloody
abstract, mate.

331
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:51,140
I don't think it's allowed,
if I'm being honest.

332
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:53,348
You wouldn't be saying that
if you'd figured it out.

333
00:25:00,676 --> 00:25:02,115
Where are the boys?

334
00:25:05,828 --> 00:25:07,363
I'll get us through this.

335
00:25:07,587 --> 00:25:08,899
- I promise, I'll...
- Oh no.

336
00:25:08,931 --> 00:25:09,699
I'll get us...

337
00:25:09,732 --> 00:25:11,267
I'll get us through
this, I promise.

338
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,379
Ah!

339
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:15,459
Come on, Jill,
it's better this way.

340
00:25:15,588 --> 00:25:17,219
Yeah, shh.

341
00:25:18,595 --> 00:25:20,067
You know how boys can be.

342
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:21,092
They'd have gotten in the way.

343
00:25:21,123 --> 00:25:24,099
And at least they didn't
have to suffer, you know?

344
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:29,476
Not really, not like some.

345
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:37,220
Shh.

346
00:25:37,316 --> 00:25:38,467
Look at it like this, Jill.

347
00:25:40,963 --> 00:25:42,339
The worst has happened.

348
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:45,923
You're a fucking murderer!

349
00:25:46,275 --> 00:25:48,099
Shh.

350
00:25:48,611 --> 00:25:50,115
As opposed to what now?

351
00:25:50,787 --> 00:25:52,131
A fucking accountant?

352
00:25:52,164 --> 00:25:56,195
Shh. Shh.

353
00:26:12,036 --> 00:26:12,899
Who's next?

354
00:26:12,932 --> 00:26:14,115
Who is next?

355
00:26:14,148 --> 00:26:15,651
Who's got one, eh?

356
00:26:16,483 --> 00:26:17,667
Come on.
Jill, what about you?

357
00:26:17,699 --> 00:26:18,627
Come on, I Spy.

358
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:19,971
No, this isn't happening.

359
00:26:20,004 --> 00:26:21,507
I hate to disappoint you,
love.

360
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,331
I spy with my little eye...

361
00:26:23,363 --> 00:26:24,291
Leave her alone!

362
00:26:24,323 --> 00:26:26,020
Something beginning with...

363
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,396
F, F. I'll play.
Just just...

364
00:26:27,427 --> 00:26:28,356
- I spy...
- For fuck's sake!

365
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:30,372
...with my little eye
something beginning...

366
00:26:30,403 --> 00:26:32,931
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with F.

367
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:38,979
- Fence.
- Fence.

368
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,403
Yes.

369
00:26:43,747 --> 00:26:45,347
Shh.

370
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:48,035
Well, that was easy.

371
00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:51,363
Shh.

372
00:26:52,676 --> 00:26:53,955
Shh.

373
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:58,275
Good on ya, mate.

374
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:35,331
Hmm?

375
00:27:36,131 --> 00:27:37,155
No, mate.

376
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:39,588
Absolutely not.

377
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,891
Tubs and I recently had
an unfortunate experience

378
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:47,907
with a Mercedes.

379
00:27:48,195 --> 00:27:50,435
Don't think we had time
to get used to it, did we?

380
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:53,892
So, the owner of the Merc?

381
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:55,812
Surprisingly narrow
taste in music.

382
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:59,300
Can you believe that he had
one CD in his whole glove box?

383
00:28:00,163 --> 00:28:01,123
One.

384
00:28:03,427 --> 00:28:05,091
You always do
what you're told?

385
00:28:11,364 --> 00:28:12,195
You know what, Jill?

386
00:28:12,227 --> 00:28:13,603
I feel a bit bloody rotten
about this,

387
00:28:14,787 --> 00:28:15,907
but I haven't actually asked
you what you do for a living.

388
00:28:16,132 --> 00:28:16,995
You know?

389
00:28:17,892 --> 00:28:19,683
We covered real ground
here with Hoaggie.

390
00:28:19,716 --> 00:28:22,563
So what is it that you do?

391
00:28:22,596 --> 00:28:24,131
- She's a teacher.
- I was asking Jill.

392
00:28:24,163 --> 00:28:25,251
She doesn't want to talk
to you so I'm talking to you.

393
00:28:25,347 --> 00:28:26,339
Same school?
Different school?

394
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,459
Same school.

395
00:28:27,492 --> 00:28:28,963
Hoaggie, could you please
just give your wife a chance

396
00:28:28,995 --> 00:28:30,339
to respond, thank you?

397
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,675
That's a noble profession, Jill.

398
00:28:37,252 --> 00:28:39,907
Nurturing the minds of the
nation's youth together.

399
00:28:41,571 --> 00:28:42,883
A teaching couple.

400
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,732
Well, is it primary?
Secondary?

401
00:28:45,763 --> 00:28:48,195
- Secondary.
- Oh, same age as your boys.

402
00:28:51,075 --> 00:28:52,259
How long have you been
working there...

403
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:53,604
Where did you say you worked?

404
00:28:53,636 --> 00:28:55,011
We didn't.

405
00:28:55,236 --> 00:28:56,163
Wellington College.

406
00:28:56,196 --> 00:28:57,315
How long you been there?

407
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,163
She's been there five years.
I've been there six.

408
00:29:00,195 --> 00:29:01,763
And where were you
before that?

409
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:04,003
I was at Scots College.

410
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:05,411
And how long were
you at Scots for?

411
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:06,500
Fuck, I don't know...

412
00:29:06,531 --> 00:29:07,395
But it wasn't the first place
that you worked, was it?

413
00:29:07,427 --> 00:29:08,964
No, it wasn't the
first place I worked at.

414
00:29:08,996 --> 00:29:11,363
OK, so where were
you before that?

415
00:29:11,587 --> 00:29:12,676
I was at Horowhenua College.

416
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:13,572
And where were
you before that?

417
00:29:13,603 --> 00:29:14,724
Before that I was
at teacher's college.

418
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:16,227
- Before that?
- Before that...

419
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:18,179
I was fucking nobody.

420
00:29:27,491 --> 00:29:28,771
And before that?

421
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:45,091
All right. Ok, then.

422
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:46,627
What's that, man?

423
00:29:48,228 --> 00:29:49,027
When were you there?

424
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:50,787
- When was I where?
- Hakawai Point.

425
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:51,876
Hakawai Point...

426
00:29:51,971 --> 00:29:54,052
Oh, that's the, um...

427
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:55,940
- That's that boy's home that's...
- Yeah.

428
00:29:55,972 --> 00:29:57,411
Oh, yeah.

429
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,419
Yeah, a bit rough some of those
places though, ain't they?

430
00:30:00,451 --> 00:30:01,347
So I hear.

431
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:02,436
Oh, but you were there?

432
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,003
No, it was just
a training stint,

433
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:06,147
you know,
in the schoolhouse.

434
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,107
I was in and out.

435
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,196
Oh, yeah, in and out.

436
00:30:08,227 --> 00:30:09,059
Yeah, I didn't see anything.

437
00:30:09,091 --> 00:30:11,076
What would you have
seen if you were?

438
00:30:11,107 --> 00:30:13,156
Well, it doesn't bear
mentioning, does it?

439
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:16,132
Hey, Tubs, you spent a bit
of time at Hakawai Point,

440
00:30:16,164 --> 00:30:17,475
didn't you, mate?

441
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:20,291
Did you enjoy your
time there, Tubs?

442
00:30:20,323 --> 00:30:20,900
Eh?

443
00:30:20,932 --> 00:30:22,467
I was there in 1988.

444
00:30:22,563 --> 00:30:24,035
It was before his time.

445
00:30:29,923 --> 00:30:30,660
Actually, you know what?

446
00:30:30,692 --> 00:30:33,027
Uh, yeah, Hakawai Point
was, um...

447
00:30:36,164 --> 00:30:39,395
Tubs, was... It's the place where
what's-his-face come from, um...

448
00:30:40,867 --> 00:30:42,371
Rudy Bocock, you know?

449
00:30:42,403 --> 00:30:44,323
He knocked over that RSA.

450
00:30:44,547 --> 00:30:46,563
You know, he beat a bunch
of senior citizens

451
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:48,291
to death with a cricket
bat or something.

452
00:30:48,387 --> 00:30:50,179
It was around Foxton ways, eh?

453
00:30:51,556 --> 00:30:54,755
Glen Lecky was a right asshole,
too, and he was from there.

454
00:30:54,883 --> 00:30:56,675
And Mark Sitko.

455
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,076
No, wait, Mark Sitko
was at Epuni.

456
00:31:01,316 --> 00:31:03,523
Any of these names ring a bell
for you, Hoaggie?

457
00:31:03,555 --> 00:31:04,611
Like I said, it
was a long time ago.

458
00:31:04,643 --> 00:31:06,084
Yeah, most of these guys
have been on the national news

459
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:06,884
at one time or another.

460
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:07,908
And believe it or not,
not everyone

461
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,636
who went there turned into
a fucking psychopath.

462
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,331
We were actually helping kids.

463
00:31:11,427 --> 00:31:12,483
How'd you get the help
that you needed

464
00:31:12,516 --> 00:31:14,179
while you were there, Tubs?

465
00:31:26,563 --> 00:31:27,619
What wing were you in?

466
00:31:27,651 --> 00:31:29,475
- Uh, what's it?
- You know, at the home.

467
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:30,627
Well, what makes you
think that I...

468
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:31,587
Oh, just cut the shit.

469
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:33,379
No, do I look familiar to you?

470
00:31:33,411 --> 00:31:34,884
People do say I have
one of those faces.

471
00:31:34,916 --> 00:31:36,291
It was a long time ago.
I was...

472
00:31:36,323 --> 00:31:37,315
What are you fucking
talking about?

473
00:31:37,347 --> 00:31:38,468
This is fucking pointless.

474
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,323
- Yes, practically, yes.
- "Practically."

475
00:31:40,355 --> 00:31:43,235
What, you think he was one of
those thugs that abused kids?

476
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:46,755
So all of this is some kind
of fucking grudge?

477
00:31:48,068 --> 00:31:50,116
I hope you got raped.

478
00:32:26,243 --> 00:32:27,588
I need to go to the...

479
00:32:31,268 --> 00:32:32,931
Can't hear.
Open up.

480
00:32:33,476 --> 00:32:34,979
What's that, Hoaggie?

481
00:32:35,939 --> 00:32:37,475
I need to go to the toilet.

482
00:32:37,602 --> 00:32:38,948
You go on the side
of the road.

483
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:40,675
There's no paper.

484
00:32:40,707 --> 00:32:41,699
We'll get you paper.

485
00:32:41,731 --> 00:32:43,011
I'll shit myself.

486
00:32:44,322 --> 00:32:45,507
So shit yourself.

487
00:32:48,548 --> 00:32:51,428
Well, I guess if you're happy
living with the stench...

488
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,580
Go on, then.

489
00:34:05,475 --> 00:34:06,755
You going far?

490
00:34:07,524 --> 00:34:09,092
Oh, never far enough, mate.

491
00:34:26,724 --> 00:34:29,444
Those homes were no kind
of a place for kids.

492
00:34:32,355 --> 00:34:34,116
No one deserves...

493
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,275
No one deserves that.

494
00:35:08,419 --> 00:35:10,115
Where did you leave them?

495
00:35:13,476 --> 00:35:15,428
My boys.
Where did you leave them?

496
00:35:17,188 --> 00:35:19,395
You shouldn't have left them
out there alone.

497
00:36:02,691 --> 00:36:04,292
Bit of a rough one.

498
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:26,499
Safe travels.

499
00:36:26,628 --> 00:36:29,348
You're, uh, out of
toilet paper in there.

500
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:30,947
Thanks.

501
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,028
You been in the war
since this morning?

502
00:36:34,404 --> 00:36:37,155
I was a bit too keen
to get off the track

503
00:36:37,188 --> 00:36:39,876
and I tripped on a bloody root.

504
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:41,411
It's not... not so bad.

505
00:36:41,442 --> 00:36:42,563
No.

506
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,252
Try again.

507
00:36:52,484 --> 00:36:53,444
That's not what happened,
Hoaggie.

508
00:36:53,475 --> 00:36:54,915
Tell him what happened.

509
00:36:55,972 --> 00:36:56,932
Go on.

510
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:02,115
- Go on.
- I, uh...

511
00:37:04,995 --> 00:37:06,306
I got a fright.

512
00:37:06,402 --> 00:37:07,875
I was frightened by...

513
00:37:08,676 --> 00:37:09,764
By a goat.

514
00:37:13,091 --> 00:37:14,372
Fell down the bank.

515
00:37:16,548 --> 00:37:18,179
Bit embarrassed, really.

516
00:37:32,995 --> 00:37:33,860
What's going on?

517
00:37:33,891 --> 00:37:35,780
I just hit my arm.

518
00:37:35,811 --> 00:37:37,476
Get in the fucking car,
Hoaggie.

519
00:38:11,716 --> 00:38:12,899
Smokes.

520
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,892
What's he...

521
00:38:41,859 --> 00:38:42,819
Ahh!

522
00:38:52,132 --> 00:38:53,187
Oh, God.

523
00:39:57,763 --> 00:39:59,171
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

524
00:39:59,203 --> 00:39:59,683
Go!

525
00:39:59,715 --> 00:40:00,548
Go!

526
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:03,043
You little cunt!

527
00:40:29,091 --> 00:40:30,051
Come on.

528
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:31,139
Come on.

529
00:40:35,235 --> 00:40:37,059
Come on. Come on.

530
00:40:37,827 --> 00:40:38,787
Come on.

531
00:40:43,044 --> 00:40:44,195
Ah!

532
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:17,475
Help!

533
00:41:20,259 --> 00:41:21,219
Ahh!

534
00:41:27,939 --> 00:41:28,868
No!
No!

535
00:41:28,899 --> 00:41:30,563
No!
Ah!

536
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,763
Would you be so kind
as to pass that to Hoaggie?

537
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:34,723
Go on and pin it
to your shirt, Hoaggie.

538
00:42:41,123 --> 00:42:43,011
My husband didn't do
those things.

539
00:42:46,499 --> 00:42:47,587
My husband wasn't one of them.

540
00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:49,091
One of who?

541
00:42:49,635 --> 00:42:50,980
- What?
- One of those...

542
00:42:51,011 --> 00:42:52,259
- One of the bad men?
- Yeah.

543
00:42:52,292 --> 00:42:54,116
- Oh, yes, he's a good man.
- Yeah.

544
00:42:54,147 --> 00:42:55,811
- You married a good man.
- Yes, I did.

545
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,283
- Good father you've chosen.
- Yes.

546
00:42:57,315 --> 00:42:59,203
- Jill, he's just trying to...
- Yes, yes, you sick fuck!

547
00:42:59,235 --> 00:43:02,563
OK, clearly, clearly you've
got an issue with me, yeah?

548
00:43:02,595 --> 00:43:04,131
You've got some idea about me.
And that's fine.

549
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:04,899
You can do whatever
you want to me.

550
00:43:04,932 --> 00:43:07,235
But just... please
just let her go.

551
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:09,283
She hasn't done
anything to you, right?

552
00:43:09,315 --> 00:43:10,499
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

553
00:43:10,531 --> 00:43:11,652
You can let her go.

554
00:43:11,683 --> 00:43:13,123
You can tie her up and leave
her on the side of the road.

555
00:43:13,155 --> 00:43:14,211
And I will play along.

556
00:43:14,243 --> 00:43:15,684
I will be whatever
you want me to be.

557
00:43:15,716 --> 00:43:17,539
- But just please let her go.
- Alan.

558
00:43:17,571 --> 00:43:18,787
No, no, no, no, no, look.

559
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,099
You've got me.

560
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:21,763
Right?
You found me.

561
00:43:22,212 --> 00:43:24,132
She hasn't done anything.

562
00:43:25,316 --> 00:43:27,491
Didn't find you.
Weren't looking for you.

563
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:31,363
No, I mean,
this is business as usual.

564
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,355
It's the next meal.

565
00:43:32,387 --> 00:43:35,267
It's the next car, isn't it,
Tubs, you know?

566
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,187
It's just a happy coincidence.

567
00:43:41,091 --> 00:43:42,211
And there's a whole
other scenario

568
00:43:42,243 --> 00:43:44,163
where a couple of backpackers
go missing and Tubs and I

569
00:43:44,196 --> 00:43:45,635
and I get to go to bed early.

570
00:44:16,515 --> 00:44:17,443
Hey, hey, hey.

571
00:44:17,475 --> 00:44:18,435
Get the fuck out.

572
00:44:19,044 --> 00:44:19,972
Get out!

573
00:44:20,004 --> 00:44:20,932
Jill!

574
00:44:20,964 --> 00:44:22,755
- You son of...
- Fuck off!

575
00:44:22,787 --> 00:44:23,715
No!

576
00:44:23,747 --> 00:44:24,707
Fuck off!

577
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,612
Jill! Jill!

578
00:44:32,835 --> 00:44:33,795
Jill!

579
00:44:36,771 --> 00:44:37,731
Ahh!

580
00:44:47,459 --> 00:44:48,675
Now, don't get me wrong.

581
00:44:49,091 --> 00:44:50,243
I'll talk all night.

582
00:44:50,628 --> 00:44:52,548
But I suspect Tubs is
keen-as to get to a pub.

583
00:44:52,931 --> 00:44:53,732
Oh, that's fair enough.

584
00:44:53,764 --> 00:44:54,883
You don't ask for much,
do you, Tubs?

585
00:44:54,915 --> 00:44:56,484
- No, please.
- "No, please."

586
00:44:56,516 --> 00:44:57,219
- I...
- Fuck you!

587
00:44:57,252 --> 00:44:58,691
- Fuck you!
- Ah, ah, ah, ah.

588
00:44:58,723 --> 00:44:59,907
Language, please, Jill.

589
00:44:59,939 --> 00:45:01,220
"No, please," what,
Hoaggie?

590
00:45:01,252 --> 00:45:02,244
I don't know what...

591
00:45:02,276 --> 00:45:04,164
Hoaggie, you've gotta stop
stuttering here, mate.

592
00:45:04,196 --> 00:45:06,371
Sooner or later you gotta
make a clear, concise point.

593
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:07,908
I don't know what
you want me to say!

594
00:45:08,004 --> 00:45:08,868
This is the funny thing, eh?

595
00:45:08,964 --> 00:45:10,723
You can't just teach people
what they need.

596
00:45:10,756 --> 00:45:14,467
No, no, no, you gotta lead
people to that realization.

597
00:45:14,596 --> 00:45:16,163
- Would you agree there, Jill?
- Please don't hurt her.

598
00:45:16,259 --> 00:45:17,155
Don't hurt her?

599
00:45:17,187 --> 00:45:18,532
Just don't hurt her.
I don't want you to...

600
00:45:18,564 --> 00:45:20,323
All right.
All right.

601
00:45:20,356 --> 00:45:22,116
I saw things.
Is that... Is that what you want?

602
00:45:22,147 --> 00:45:23,364
I was at the home.
I saw things.

603
00:45:23,396 --> 00:45:25,092
- Alan, don't!
- No, no, no, Jill.

604
00:45:25,123 --> 00:45:28,483
No, Jill, you need to
listen to Hoaggie right now.

605
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,411
He's opening up to us.

606
00:45:29,443 --> 00:45:31,012
I don't know what
you want me to say!

607
00:45:31,044 --> 00:45:33,251
Well, you said
you saw things, mate.

608
00:45:33,283 --> 00:45:35,075
That's all a bit vague for me.

609
00:45:36,323 --> 00:45:38,211
Locker treatments!

610
00:45:38,243 --> 00:45:39,556
Locker treatments!

611
00:45:40,131 --> 00:45:41,604
The housemasters called them
"locker treatments."

612
00:45:41,636 --> 00:45:42,980
They would hold the kid's
head in the locker

613
00:45:43,011 --> 00:45:44,995
and they would beat them
with a leather belt.

614
00:45:45,027 --> 00:45:46,244
Tell Jill that.

615
00:45:46,404 --> 00:45:48,803
And then they would
put the kids in the cells

616
00:45:48,899 --> 00:45:51,011
and lock them in there
for days sometimes.

617
00:45:51,044 --> 00:45:52,675
And, and there was
a bloke who would

618
00:45:52,707 --> 00:45:54,403
make the boys fight each other.

619
00:45:54,435 --> 00:45:58,659
And there was a nightwatchman,
Ben Creely, he got fired for...

620
00:45:58,756 --> 00:45:59,619
for going into the boys beds.

621
00:45:59,651 --> 00:46:02,211
I don't want to talk about
a kid-fucker!

622
00:46:02,307 --> 00:46:03,684
Why did you bring him up?

623
00:46:03,716 --> 00:46:04,644
Did you fuck kids?

624
00:46:04,676 --> 00:46:05,411
No, no, no.

625
00:46:05,444 --> 00:46:06,596
Well, then why'd
you bring him up?!

626
00:46:06,629 --> 00:46:09,923
- Just tell me what you want.
- I want you to talk about you.

627
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:11,619
They hit kids.

628
00:46:11,651 --> 00:46:13,891
You know, I saw guys
hitting kids

629
00:46:13,987 --> 00:46:15,620
with clipboards
when they were on-line.

630
00:46:15,651 --> 00:46:16,867
What's on-line, Hoaggie?

631
00:46:19,363 --> 00:46:20,419
What's on-line?

632
00:46:20,515 --> 00:46:24,163
It's a...
It was a...

633
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,379
It was a procedure.

634
00:46:25,411 --> 00:46:27,075
It was... it was a roll call.

635
00:46:27,171 --> 00:46:28,931
You know,
they'd line the kids up

636
00:46:28,963 --> 00:46:31,236
on the... on the four-square
court, you know,

637
00:46:31,267 --> 00:46:32,035
the three lines.

638
00:46:32,067 --> 00:46:33,859
Did you ever
take the kids on-line?

639
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,204
- No, I never.
- Are you sure about that?

640
00:46:35,236 --> 00:46:36,132
I was an assistant teacher.

641
00:46:36,164 --> 00:46:39,651
Are you absolutely sure
about that, Hoaggie?

642
00:46:47,844 --> 00:46:49,251
Yeah, there was one.

643
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:52,099
There was one time.
Yeah, I wouldn't usually...

644
00:46:52,131 --> 00:46:53,987
I wouldn't usually,
but they were understaffed.

645
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,803
And that they got me
to help with the roll call.

646
00:46:58,051 --> 00:46:59,524
Shit.

647
00:47:00,324 --> 00:47:01,156
Shit.

648
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,395
There was...

649
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:09,796
There was a boy.

650
00:47:11,844 --> 00:47:12,868
He would have been
about eight...

651
00:47:13,508 --> 00:47:17,091
Eight or nine years old
and he'd given himself a tattoo

652
00:47:17,123 --> 00:47:19,139
of a swastika on his arm.

653
00:47:19,556 --> 00:47:22,276
You know, on the
underside of his forearm.

654
00:47:22,308 --> 00:47:25,731
He'd... he'd done it himself
in his room with a needle

655
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:28,036
and some pen ink.

656
00:47:29,828 --> 00:47:31,748
And one of the housemasters,
um...

657
00:47:33,507 --> 00:47:34,467
Freiberg.

658
00:47:35,331 --> 00:47:37,155
His name...
His name was Tim Freiberg.

659
00:47:38,211 --> 00:47:39,492
He had the kids on-line

660
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:41,859
and the kid with
the tattoo was...

661
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:44,067
he was small so he was
at the front of the line.

662
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:46,979
And Freiberg saw the tattoo and
he got the kid to step forward.

663
00:47:47,011 --> 00:47:51,908
And he... he got one
of the other housemasters

664
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,052
to go and get a wire brush.

665
00:47:56,004 --> 00:47:58,531
You know,
like the ones you use to

666
00:47:58,563 --> 00:48:01,668
scrub the grills
in the kitchen.

667
00:48:03,299 --> 00:48:05,283
And he handed the
wire brush to the kid

668
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:07,075
he said, "Scrub that off."

669
00:48:07,107 --> 00:48:09,795
You know, "I want you to scrub
off that swastika tattoo."

670
00:48:11,779 --> 00:48:12,803
And the kid didn't
want to do it.

671
00:48:12,835 --> 00:48:14,020
He refused.

672
00:48:14,052 --> 00:48:17,411
And so... so... so Freiberg got
one of the young housemasters

673
00:48:17,443 --> 00:48:20,451
to hold the boy,
and he did it himself.

674
00:48:20,483 --> 00:48:22,371
He grabbed him by the arm
and he started...

675
00:48:22,403 --> 00:48:23,780
he started scrubbing
at the skin.

676
00:48:23,812 --> 00:48:27,043
And the... the boy was...

677
00:48:27,556 --> 00:48:30,147
the boy was screaming
and the other boys were crying.

678
00:48:30,179 --> 00:48:33,188
And Freiberg, he was scrubbing
and scrubbing him.

679
00:48:34,819 --> 00:48:38,819
And I... I just stood there
and watched.

680
00:48:39,555 --> 00:48:40,515
Hey.

681
00:48:42,627 --> 00:48:43,971
I just stood there...

682
00:48:46,756 --> 00:48:48,291
I mean, what could I do?
It wasn't my place.

683
00:48:48,387 --> 00:48:49,315
It wasn't my place.

684
00:48:49,347 --> 00:48:52,324
It just wasn't my place.
What could I have done?

685
00:48:52,356 --> 00:48:53,922
What could I have done?

686
00:48:58,276 --> 00:48:59,331
What could you have done?

687
00:48:59,428 --> 00:49:01,475
It was 30 fucking years ago.

688
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:02,755
It's in the past.

689
00:49:02,787 --> 00:49:04,739
Let's just leave it
in the past.

690
00:49:07,587 --> 00:49:08,547
Jill...

691
00:49:23,811 --> 00:49:24,899
Good story.

692
00:49:30,116 --> 00:49:31,267
Visceral.

693
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:35,171
You know, lots of details.

694
00:49:36,836 --> 00:49:39,042
That is the most important
thing about a story.

695
00:49:39,556 --> 00:49:41,187
It's the details.

696
00:49:45,411 --> 00:49:47,715
Except it wasn't a wire brush.
It was nylon.

697
00:49:49,284 --> 00:49:51,555
Still did the trick,
just took three times longer.

698
00:49:53,828 --> 00:49:55,235
See, you know what?

699
00:49:55,876 --> 00:49:59,459
It's the capacity to get
to the core things, Hoaggie,

700
00:49:59,492 --> 00:50:00,580
you know?

701
00:50:01,379 --> 00:50:03,299
Just strip away
that old self-deceit.

702
00:50:06,148 --> 00:50:07,268
It's what's important.

703
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:12,195
All right. Look,
you got what you want.

704
00:50:12,228 --> 00:50:13,763
Just let her go, please.

705
00:50:15,619 --> 00:50:17,924
Please just...
just let her go.

706
00:50:17,955 --> 00:50:19,395
Let... Let her go.

707
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:22,468
Let her go.

708
00:50:36,228 --> 00:50:37,892
Oh, look at those stars.

709
00:50:42,531 --> 00:50:43,812
I remember...

710
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,628
Ah, years ago now...

711
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:51,011
I spent a few weeks
out at Hokianga.

712
00:50:52,484 --> 00:50:55,300
Some nights
after we'd had a few,

713
00:50:55,395 --> 00:50:58,979
we'd take this little thingie
out into the water,

714
00:50:59,651 --> 00:51:03,171
sit there, talk,
watch the lights of Rawene

715
00:51:03,204 --> 00:51:07,780
down the harbor,
just smoking it up, you know?

716
00:51:08,931 --> 00:51:12,131
Lie back,
rocked by the swell.

717
00:51:19,332 --> 00:51:21,284
Always seems to me like the sky
is so much closer

718
00:51:21,315 --> 00:51:22,948
when you're out on the water.

719
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:30,179
<i>Mom...</i>

720
00:52:44,355 --> 00:52:46,403
<i>Mom...</i>

721
00:53:21,796 --> 00:53:22,916
Jill...

722
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,675
What do you think, Jill?

723
00:54:27,203 --> 00:54:28,963
Does it look any different
out there to you?

724
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:32,803
From when you were coming up?

725
00:55:17,923 --> 00:55:19,843
I always knew
there was something.

726
00:55:24,772 --> 00:55:26,084
I could see it in your eyes.

727
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:27,779
I could see you go back there.

728
00:55:33,795 --> 00:55:36,548
There is a difference between
doing something

729
00:55:36,579 --> 00:55:38,339
and letting it happen.

730
00:55:39,299 --> 00:55:40,835
There has to be.

731
00:55:46,148 --> 00:55:47,939
They live on
the same street though.

732
00:55:51,683 --> 00:55:53,315
Just wish you had told me.

733
00:56:05,348 --> 00:56:06,468
Satisfied?

734
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:10,148
I'm getting there.

735
00:56:13,155 --> 00:56:14,948
Why don't you go
fuck yourself?

736
00:56:21,955 --> 00:56:23,107
Jill!

737
00:56:23,203 --> 00:56:24,419
Jill, Jill, Jill.

738
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:29,571
Get up.

739
00:56:34,275 --> 00:56:35,331
Jill, just get up!

740
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:36,643
Ahh!

741
00:56:39,204 --> 00:56:40,483
Jill, just get up!

742
00:56:42,883 --> 00:56:43,971
<i>Get up.
Get up.</i>

743
00:56:46,211 --> 00:56:46,851
<i>Jill?</i>

744
00:57:24,676 --> 00:57:25,956
Don't, don't, don't
don't, don't!

745
00:57:53,476 --> 00:57:55,523
Well, she had spirit.
I'll give her that.

746
00:57:57,828 --> 00:57:59,459
I see why you married her.

747
00:58:38,531 --> 00:58:39,876
I mean, a...

748
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:42,659
Even a good audiobook
wouldn't go amiss.

749
00:58:43,363 --> 00:58:44,483
Eh?

750
00:58:47,459 --> 00:58:48,643
Shit.

751
00:58:50,339 --> 00:58:52,515
"I ought to be like him,

752
00:58:52,548 --> 00:58:54,883
but I am rather
the fallen angel."

753
00:58:54,915 --> 00:58:57,092
You ever read
"Frankenstein," Hoaggie?

754
00:59:06,531 --> 00:59:10,115
Let me guess.
You identified with the Monster.

755
00:59:14,724 --> 00:59:16,259
Yeah, of course you did.

756
00:59:22,371 --> 00:59:24,931
You misunderstood the story,
you fucking idiot.

757
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:29,699
I didn't make you.

758
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:34,115
Oh, there we go.

759
00:59:43,299 --> 00:59:44,355
Aw, come on.

760
01:00:07,171 --> 01:00:08,803
Aw, shit...

761
01:00:10,275 --> 01:00:11,235
Open the boot, mate.

762
01:00:16,995 --> 01:00:18,756
Maybe you should call the AA.

763
01:00:20,004 --> 01:00:21,539
Ugh...

764
01:00:26,243 --> 01:00:27,203
Oh!

765
01:00:27,427 --> 01:00:28,387
Ahh!

766
01:02:19,716 --> 01:02:20,804
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

767
01:02:20,932 --> 01:02:21,796
<i>Good. You all right?</i>

768
01:02:21,828 --> 01:02:22,371
<i>Ah, yeah.
Everything is fine, mate.</i>

769
01:02:22,403 --> 01:02:24,547
<i>Went a bit tits-up, eh?</i>

770
01:02:25,251 --> 01:02:26,947
<i>Yeah, we got a spare.</i>

771
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:28,419
<i>Yeah, so good to go.</i>

772
01:02:28,516 --> 01:02:30,532
Yeah, well,
thanks for stopping, eh?

773
01:02:37,284 --> 01:02:38,435
Jesus!

774
01:02:44,932 --> 01:02:46,371
Fuck!

775
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,812
Jesus Christ...

776
01:02:48,419 --> 01:02:50,083
- Ahh!
- Tubs!

777
01:02:59,907 --> 01:03:01,859
Fucking fix it.
Fix it!

778
01:04:23,588 --> 01:04:24,580
Stop!

779
01:04:27,139 --> 01:04:28,099
Stop!

780
01:04:29,604 --> 01:04:31,075
Stop! Stop!

781
01:04:33,731 --> 01:04:34,691
Stop!

782
01:04:41,731 --> 01:04:42,627
There's two men.

783
01:04:42,659 --> 01:04:43,427
They've got a gun.
They...

784
01:04:43,459 --> 01:04:45,347
They killed...
They killed people.

785
01:04:45,379 --> 01:04:47,202
We gotta get out of here
straight away.

786
01:04:48,452 --> 01:04:50,211
We need to get out of here.

787
01:04:51,042 --> 01:04:52,995
Do I look like
I'm fucking having a laugh?

788
01:04:53,219 --> 01:04:54,308
Fuck off!

789
01:04:55,811 --> 01:04:57,156
I don't have time...

790
01:04:57,444 --> 01:04:59,364
I don't have time for your
posturing bullshit, OK?

791
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:00,899
You're a tough guy,
I get it.

792
01:05:00,932 --> 01:05:02,116
You've made your point.

793
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:04,036
Now let me in the fucking car.

794
01:05:04,996 --> 01:05:06,692
Walk away.

795
01:05:14,307 --> 01:05:15,524
What the...
Oi, you!

796
01:05:15,684 --> 01:05:16,931
What the fuck?

797
01:05:18,531 --> 01:05:19,842
Get out of the car!

798
01:05:19,939 --> 01:05:20,963
Fucking get off...

799
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:22,180
Oi!

800
01:05:27,779 --> 01:05:28,739
Shit...

801
01:05:36,676 --> 01:05:37,987
Get in the car.

802
01:05:38,564 --> 01:05:40,292
- Get in the car!
- Come on.

803
01:05:42,979 --> 01:05:44,802
- Get in.
- Fuck.

804
01:05:57,764 --> 01:05:58,788
Evening.

805
01:05:59,299 --> 01:06:00,419
Oh, shit!

806
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:02,595
Drive, just drive.
Just drive.

807
01:06:02,628 --> 01:06:03,971
<i>Shut it off!</i>

808
01:06:05,348 --> 01:06:06,500
- That's one option.
- Go.

809
01:06:06,531 --> 01:06:07,907
- Shut the fuck up.
- Go.

810
01:06:07,939 --> 01:06:09,028
Go.
Just drive.

811
01:06:09,124 --> 01:06:10,948
- Shut up!
- Drive.

812
01:06:10,979 --> 01:06:12,771
Or you can hear me out.

813
01:06:17,124 --> 01:06:18,275
Hear me out.

814
01:06:21,251 --> 01:06:22,660
<i>How many you got
in there, mate?</i>

815
01:06:22,755 --> 01:06:24,323
- What do you want?
- Just drive. Just drive.

816
01:06:24,548 --> 01:06:26,436
<i>Just dispensing a bit
of local justice, man.</i>

817
01:06:26,468 --> 01:06:28,131
- Don't listen to him.
- <i>What's your name?</i>

818
01:06:28,163 --> 01:06:28,899
- No.
- Kynan.

819
01:06:28,931 --> 01:06:30,372
No, no, don't
talk to him, mate.

820
01:06:30,404 --> 01:06:31,779
Just don't talk to him.

821
01:06:31,811 --> 01:06:33,059
<i>OK, Kynan.</i>

822
01:06:34,244 --> 01:06:35,586
<i>I mean, I don't have time
to spin you the whole yarn,</i>

823
01:06:35,619 --> 01:06:36,836
<i>but that's a bad, bad man</i>

824
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:38,244
<i>you got in the backseat
of your car there.</i>

825
01:06:38,276 --> 01:06:40,164
No, that's bullshit, man.
That's bullshit.

826
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:40,995
<i>You don't want to know
the kind of shit that happens</i>

827
01:06:41,028 --> 01:06:41,955
<i>to kids when
this guy is around.</i>

828
01:06:41,988 --> 01:06:43,844
I didn't do any of that.
I didn't do any of that!

829
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:45,379
Don't try and split hairs,
man.

830
01:06:45,411 --> 01:06:46,692
Me being in the
car with you here now

831
01:06:46,724 --> 01:06:48,227
is the only thing
keeping you alive.

832
01:06:48,259 --> 01:06:49,476
Oh, you don't give a shit
about these kids.

833
01:06:49,508 --> 01:06:50,532
Jesus fucking Christ.

834
01:06:50,564 --> 01:06:52,228
Hey, you don't
know this man

835
01:06:52,259 --> 01:06:53,571
- and you don't know what he's done.
- Just go.

836
01:06:53,604 --> 01:06:54,851
Just... just... just...
just go.

837
01:06:54,882 --> 01:06:56,899
Just drive,
you stupid fucking cunt.

838
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:09,828
What's the best thing
to do here, Kynan?

839
01:07:11,588 --> 01:07:12,644
Stay in the car.

840
01:07:12,771 --> 01:07:14,211
Stay in the car.

841
01:07:15,555 --> 01:07:19,364
Boy, all you gotta do
is walk away.

842
01:07:27,779 --> 01:07:28,739
Shit...

843
01:07:46,755 --> 01:07:48,036
No, no, no, don't do this.

844
01:07:48,068 --> 01:07:49,251
Don't do this.

845
01:07:49,699 --> 01:07:50,916
Don't do this.

846
01:07:50,948 --> 01:07:52,068
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

847
01:07:52,164 --> 01:07:53,124
Don't do this.

848
01:07:53,156 --> 01:07:54,402
Don't do this.

849
01:07:54,884 --> 01:07:56,195
Oh, no!

850
01:07:56,291 --> 01:07:57,379
Don't do this.

851
01:07:58,499 --> 01:07:59,492
No.

852
01:08:16,196 --> 01:08:17,828
Thank you for your
understanding.

853
01:08:31,972 --> 01:08:32,932
No!

854
01:08:57,731 --> 01:08:58,691
Boom.

855
01:09:57,924 --> 01:09:59,428
Yeah, that's right.

856
01:10:00,579 --> 01:10:01,539
Good boy.

857
01:10:04,003 --> 01:10:05,219
I know you.

858
01:10:05,956 --> 01:10:09,892
Boy's home,
halfway house, prison.

859
01:10:12,164 --> 01:10:13,956
You feel at home in a cage.

860
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:17,924
Oh, you think
you're a free man, eh?

861
01:10:22,628 --> 01:10:24,419
Still on a leash, eh?

862
01:11:06,115 --> 01:11:07,587
One more stop.

863
01:11:08,708 --> 01:11:10,211
Then pub.

864
01:13:19,524 --> 01:13:22,756
I spy with my little eye...

865
01:15:11,844 --> 01:15:13,347
Come on, old son.

866
01:15:14,083 --> 01:15:15,396
Tubs will help you.

867
01:15:43,811 --> 01:15:44,835
What you doin'?

868
01:15:49,859 --> 01:15:50,819
<i>Eh?</i>

869
01:15:53,955 --> 01:15:54,915
<i>Fuck me.</i>

870
01:15:59,235 --> 01:16:00,195
Suit yourself.

871
01:16:03,523 --> 01:16:04,612
<i>All right, Hoaggie.</i>

872
01:16:05,091 --> 01:16:06,532
<i>Let's get you on-line.</i>

873
01:16:08,803 --> 01:16:10,307
<i>Ah, my head.</i>

874
01:17:35,331 --> 01:17:37,027
What are the chances,
you think,

875
01:17:39,043 --> 01:17:40,612
of us meeting like we did?

876
01:17:43,139 --> 01:17:45,059
Well, it's a small country,
mate.

877
01:17:47,107 --> 01:17:49,923
You took us in,
you spit us out at seventeen.

878
01:17:51,651 --> 01:17:53,315
Where do you think we go?

879
01:18:06,468 --> 01:18:08,707
Up until tonight,
I'd always...

880
01:18:10,404 --> 01:18:12,771
Always ask myself
why I didn't do something,

881
01:18:14,116 --> 01:18:15,779
why I was such a coward.

882
01:18:28,484 --> 01:18:31,171
It's not right, you know,
blaming it on cowardice.

883
01:18:35,779 --> 01:18:37,571
Because the truth
of the matter is I just...

884
01:18:40,004 --> 01:18:41,731
I just thought you deserved it.

885
01:18:54,179 --> 01:18:55,364
I should have helped.

886
01:18:56,003 --> 01:18:57,316
<i>I should have helped you.</i>

887
01:19:00,324 --> 01:19:02,467
<i>What do you mean,
you should have helped me?</i>

888
01:19:04,483 --> 01:19:05,988
Well, you...

889
01:19:08,004 --> 01:19:09,700
You-you...
You were the...

890
01:19:10,339 --> 01:19:11,363
You.

891
01:19:21,859 --> 01:19:23,907
If it wasn't me,
it was some other kid.

892
01:19:32,611 --> 01:19:34,275
<i>We're all the same to you.</i>

893
01:19:35,331 --> 01:19:37,027
You're all the same to us.

894
01:19:50,948 --> 01:19:51,908
Come on, now.

895
01:19:53,443 --> 01:19:55,972
No need to drag this out
any longer, you know?

896
01:20:34,851 --> 01:20:35,971
Ahh!

897
01:20:58,019 --> 01:20:59,651
Where are you going,
Hoaggie?

898
01:21:00,899 --> 01:21:01,859
You got me.

899
01:21:04,739 --> 01:21:06,402
None of you cunts
have got me, eh?

900
01:21:06,531 --> 01:21:08,355
None of yous, none of yous
have got me.

901
01:21:08,451 --> 01:21:10,371
Because I reckon it's...

902
01:21:17,219 --> 01:21:18,179
Ugh...

903
01:21:26,562 --> 01:21:27,491
Fuck off.

904
01:21:35,492 --> 01:21:36,676
Nearly done.

905
01:21:53,411 --> 01:21:56,322
Cheeky little bastard.
Cheeky old bastard, old fuck.

906
01:22:01,379 --> 01:22:03,396
Stuff... That's the stuff...

907
01:22:04,035 --> 01:22:05,795
Didn't you reckon...

908
01:22:43,716 --> 01:22:45,251
I hate this place.

909
