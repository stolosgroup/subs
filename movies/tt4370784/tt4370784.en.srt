THE INNOCENTS

4
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:02,793
Poland, December 1945

5
00:03:16,584 --> 00:03:18,168
Sister, Sister!

6
00:03:25,168 --> 00:03:27,584
Got money?
- Take me to a doctor.

7
00:03:27,668 --> 00:03:29,626
Give me 10 zlotys.

8
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,334
No money.
- I'll help if you give me something.

9
00:03:36,543 --> 00:03:39,751
Will this do?
Not a Polish or Russian doctor.

10
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:40,876
All right.

11
00:04:23,168 --> 00:04:24,500
What's that nun?

12
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,668
So, happy to be leaving?

13
00:04:41,084 --> 00:04:43,293
Let's prepare the next departure.

14
00:04:45,334 --> 00:04:47,668
Do you see any penicillin here?

15
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:49,834
No, there's none left.

16
00:04:51,043 --> 00:04:52,500
This is all we have.

17
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:58,459
Are you pinching it for yourself?
- Very funny.

18
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:01,959
Doctor...
- I'm busy right now.

19
00:05:02,793 --> 00:05:05,375
We need you in here.

20
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,834
I need help.
- I don't understand.

21
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,084
Sick woman... Polish.

22
00:05:13,293 --> 00:05:15,000
Only French here.

23
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:18,709
She'll die.

24
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:21,750
Woman going to die.

25
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:24,625
Go to the Polish Red Cross.

26
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,625
I don't understand.
Help me.

27
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:31,459
The Polish Red Cross.
- No! I beseech you!

28
00:05:31,543 --> 00:05:33,168
I'm sorry...

29
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,418
Help me!
- The Polish, all right?

30
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:14,500
Cut it.

31
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,875
That's good.

32
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:21,834
Finish up.

33
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,083
Who is this?

34
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:15,083
A doctor. I was worried.
- Go to your cell.

35
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,293
Do you speak French?

36
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,875
Yes, I speak French.

37
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:37,168
Are you a doctor?
- I work with the Red Cross.

38
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:40,125
I'm Sister Maria.

39
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:43,168
This is our Abbess,
Mother Jadwiga Oledzka.

40
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,750
Mathilde Beaulieu.

41
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:53,125
Has she been like this long?
- Since yesterday.

42
00:09:55,543 --> 00:09:57,375
Her family threw her out.

43
00:09:58,084 --> 00:10:01,208
We've secretly taken her in
out of charity.

44
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:03,375
Fear not, I'm sworn to silence.

45
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,125
Is that necessary?
- Do you know another way?

46
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,583
Stop it.

47
00:10:24,668 --> 00:10:26,958
No!
- Stop resisting!

48
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,500
It's a breech baby.
I'll have to operate.

49
00:10:47,418 --> 00:10:50,125
What did she say?
- It'll be fine.

50
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,959
Fetch the priest!
- Calm down.

51
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,543
The lamp.

52
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:09,333
Hold these.

53
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:42,959
I'll bring some penicillin tomorrow.

54
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:48,959
Thank you, but no need.
Our herbalist has what we need.

55
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:53,668
I want to check
there are no complications.

56
00:13:58,043 --> 00:14:00,208
Why not?
It's a simple request.

57
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:03,458
Simple for you, but not for us.

58
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,708
If the mother and baby die,
you'll be responsible too.

59
00:14:10,168 --> 00:14:12,625
Can I come back tomorrow or not?

60
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,000
Come back at Lauds.

61
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:22,418
The dawn prayer.

62
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:26,208
While they pray, I'll let you in.
- All right.

63
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:15,418
Hello.

64
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:32,500
Forgive me.

65
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:35,500
You're here now?

66
00:15:38,043 --> 00:15:39,209
Pliers.

67
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:42,668
I'm talking to you. Pliers.

68
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,000
You just woke?

69
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:57,125
This is bad, really bad.

70
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:04,375
Compress.

71
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,333
What were you up to all night?

72
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:15,708
Gaspard will finish.
Get some coffee or a shot of adrenaline.

73
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:18,083
Go and sleep. You're no use.

74
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,333
I had insomnia.
- You have insomnia?

75
00:16:22,418 --> 00:16:24,000
Since when?

76
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,500
Off you go.

77
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,293
Go.

78
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,168
Gaspard, compress.

79
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,125
You forget
our lives no longer belong to us.

80
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:10,625
I know you've been sad

81
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:13,959
since God summoned our sister
two months ago.

82
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:17,042
But grief is no excuse.

83
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:22,417
Sister, you've broken one of our rules,
that of obedience.

84
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,250
And not for the first time.

85
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,084
Forgive me, Mother.

86
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:30,167
I've forgiven you before.
And I forgive you now.

87
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,500
Do not try our patience again.

88
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:40,209
You'll stay a week in your cell
and take a vow of silence.

89
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:43,292
Sister Joanna will bring your meals.
That's all.

90
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:05,250
Were you seen?
- I didn't meet anyone.

91
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'll need to see the scar.

92
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,875
Let her see the scar.

93
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,334
No...

94
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:37,500
Tell her to let me.

95
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:39,250
Sister, let her.

96
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,375
I can't.

97
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:47,292
I can't.

98
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,417
Use the antiseptic twice daily.

99
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:17,584
May I see the baby?

100
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,792
He's no longer here.
- What?

101
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:23,542
Our Mother took him
to Zofia's aunt.

102
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:27,667
Hadn't her family rejected her?
- Her parents, yes.

103
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,459
But her aunt is pious
and has many children.

104
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:32,292
She'll look after him.

105
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:22,417
Sister?

106
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,875
Sister Anna!

107
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:29,250
Sister...

108
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:42,500
No.

109
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:46,167
I don't want to.

110
00:21:48,584 --> 00:21:50,792
I don't want to die.

111
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,667
Sister, leave us.

112
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,709
Join me in my office.

113
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:10,667
Follow me.

114
00:22:19,334 --> 00:22:24,375
We were persecuted by the Germans,
then the Russians arrived.

115
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,792
For us, when they...

116
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,584
burst into our convent, it was...

117
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,667
an indescribable nightmare.

118
00:22:52,334 --> 00:22:55,500
Only God's help will allow us
to overcome it.

119
00:22:57,917 --> 00:23:00,000
They stayed here for days.

120
00:23:06,542 --> 00:23:08,750
How many are in that condition?

121
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:12,875
Seven.

122
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:17,000
No, six now that Sister Zofia...

123
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:19,334
God's help won't be enough.

124
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,584
We're in the hands of Providence.

125
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,375
You need someone qualified.

126
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:27,959
I can send
a Polish Red Cross midwife.

127
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,917
If you do that,
our convent will be shut down.

128
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
If we're evicted,
our girls will be objects of shame.

129
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,084
People will find out.

130
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:43,750
Everyone will reject them.
Many will die.

131
00:23:44,334 --> 00:23:46,834
My duty is to protect our secret.

132
00:23:46,917 --> 00:23:49,709
They'll give birth in...
- We'll help.

133
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,709
You already said that.

134
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:55,667
They'll go to Heaven.
Good for them.

135
00:23:56,584 --> 00:23:57,959
But I care about life.

136
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:02,250
No one will enter this convent.

137
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,375
All right.

138
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,875
I'll report to my superiors.

139
00:24:29,792 --> 00:24:31,125
Miss...

140
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:40,709
Our Mother agrees.
- I'll look for someone.

141
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:43,167
No, it has to be you.

142
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,709
I helped in an emergency, but...
- It must be you!

143
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:48,292
Or no one.

144
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:14,167
Here's to the amputees
and our failures.

145
00:25:21,334 --> 00:25:24,167
Talk to me.
You never say anything.

146
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,167
And girls who never say anything...

147
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:29,542
are a real rarity.

148
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:32,167
Typical man talk.

149
00:25:34,459 --> 00:25:36,292
I just have nothing to say.

150
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:39,000
At home,
we couldn't talk at dinner

151
00:25:39,084 --> 00:25:40,750
or anywhere else.

152
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,417
A Catholic family...

153
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,792
Upper-class...
An only daughter.

154
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:53,209
Not at all.
A working-class family.

155
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,667
Die-hard Communist parents.

156
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,334
OK...

157
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,250
They funded my studies

158
00:26:00,334 --> 00:26:03,375
and when I left to come here,
they felt let down.

159
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,917
You see,
you're not so silent when you want.

160
00:26:09,542 --> 00:26:12,334
It's the vodka.
Your plan's working.

161
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:18,417
Enough about me.
What about you?

162
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,917
Me...

163
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:24,417
A fine upper-class family.

164
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,459
Obviously not very Catholic.

165
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:30,750
We were either lawyers or doctors.

166
00:26:30,834 --> 00:26:34,667
And since I hate claptrap,
I chose medicine.

167
00:26:35,334 --> 00:26:38,292
They're proud of you?
- They were.

168
00:26:52,084 --> 00:26:55,875
They died in Bergen-Belsen.
Luckily, I'm an only son.

169
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:05,125
I left for London in '40,
but not via the Free Zone.

170
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:07,209
That's what saved me.

171
00:27:09,917 --> 00:27:12,417
I won't return to France after this.

172
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:15,542
I can go where I want.

173
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,000
I'm free.

174
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:20,792
Aren't you?

175
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,750
Don't you get sick of it?

176
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:34,709
That permanent stubborn air with me...

177
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,417
Enough doom and gloom.

178
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,500
Come on!

179
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,875
This is it.

180
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:29,709
I'll come with you.

181
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,375
Good night.

182
00:28:34,209 --> 00:28:36,167
I don't want to.
- Me neither.

183
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,875
I mean it.
- So do I.

184
00:28:40,042 --> 00:28:41,125
What?

185
00:28:41,209 --> 00:28:43,125
You're too old.
- Charming...

186
00:28:43,209 --> 00:28:44,875
Not so loud.

187
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:47,209
You didn't say that the first time!

188
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:52,167
It's not true.
I may be ugly, but I'm not old.

189
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,500
No, you're not that ugly.

190
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,500
Really?

191
00:28:57,917 --> 00:28:59,084
Come here.
- What?

192
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:00,167
Come here.

193
00:29:00,834 --> 00:29:03,500
I take that as encouragement,
you know.

194
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,625
Careful!

195
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:16,917
Help me!
- How?

196
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,417
Help me!

197
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:21,584
I can't help you.
- Help me!

198
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,209
The more time passes,
the better you are in bed.

199
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,917
Communists are like that.
- Oh, please...

200
00:29:41,584 --> 00:29:43,125
No propaganda.

201
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:09,084
In your opinion,

202
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:13,250
how will the new regime
treat the Polish Church?

203
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:15,459
What the hell do you care?

204
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:19,084
The Polish Church interests you?

205
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:22,375
I'm just asking.

206
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:26,250
I hope they'll piss it off.

207
00:30:26,334 --> 00:30:29,000
And not just the Church,
the people too.

208
00:30:31,042 --> 00:30:32,667
That's not very kind.

209
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,917
What have the Poles done to you?

210
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,667
I can't stand them.

211
00:30:37,042 --> 00:30:40,709
They got what they deserved
with the Russians and the Germans.

212
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,792
You're very bitter.
- Maybe I have my reasons.

213
00:30:56,209 --> 00:31:01,167
The only Poles I like were
in the Warsaw ghetto.

214
00:31:05,084 --> 00:31:07,125
There's not one of them left.

215
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:13,584
Shit, my landlords.
I'm in trouble if they heard us.

216
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:17,000
If you agree,
we're going to ignore them.

217
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,875
There...

218
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,500
I can no longer reconcile my faith
with these terrible events.

219
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:52,417
God, of whom I still consider myself
to be the divine bride,

220
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,042
nonetheless wanted this.

221
00:32:55,084 --> 00:32:56,459
Wanted it?

222
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:02,750
If it happened,
that means He wanted it.

223
00:33:02,834 --> 00:33:04,709
We cannot know what God wants.

224
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:08,959
The only truth is His love.

225
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:12,917
And this life
that has been forced into me...

226
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:18,834
that will soon come forth...

227
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,250
what does He want me to do with it?

228
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,875
Let's kneel, Sister.

229
00:33:33,084 --> 00:33:34,792
We're going to pray.

230
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:38,084
It's our only consolation.

231
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:04,000
Your aunt took the child
as a gift from God.

232
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,083
She will love him as her own.

233
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,333
I know this is a harsh ordeal.

234
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:26,001
But it can strengthen your faith
and your calling.

235
00:34:32,001 --> 00:34:37,043
The diocese still hasn't found anyone
to replace the late Father Piasecki.

236
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,918
As for the vows ceremony,

237
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:45,001
I've postponed it twice.
I cannot do it again.

238
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,543
The ceremony will be held
two months from now.

239
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:53,918
In the meantime, some of you will be
examined by the young woman

240
00:34:54,001 --> 00:34:57,001
who is here
with the French Red Cross mission.

241
00:34:58,001 --> 00:35:01,501
She will help you.
You must trust her.

242
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:20,418
If the ceremony is in spring,
can we tell our parents?

243
00:35:20,501 --> 00:35:21,583
Of course!

244
00:35:21,668 --> 00:35:24,833
Sisters, let's return to our duties.

245
00:35:44,001 --> 00:35:45,458
Sisters...

246
00:35:47,876 --> 00:35:49,543
Who will go first?

247
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:05,083
I'm scared, aren't you?

248
00:36:16,168 --> 00:36:17,293
She can lie down.

249
00:36:18,293 --> 00:36:19,793
Lie down, Sister.

250
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:52,376
Everything's fine.
She can get dressed.

251
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:06,668
No.

252
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:11,043
She mustn't be afraid,
I'll just check the baby's position.

253
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:15,458
Don't be afraid.
It's to see if the baby's all right.

254
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:18,668
I don't want to go to Hell.

255
00:37:21,168 --> 00:37:22,833
She fears damnation.

256
00:37:27,418 --> 00:37:30,751
It may seem incomprehensible
to the outside world...

257
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:37,168
Despite what has happened,
we must still respect our vow of chastity.

258
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:09,083
I know they've been abused.

259
00:38:09,543 --> 00:38:11,918
I'm here to help. Tell me how.

260
00:38:16,376 --> 00:38:17,918
It's not easy.

261
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:22,833
We're not allowed to show our bodies.

262
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:27,333
And even less be touched.
It's a sin.

263
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:30,583
I took risks to come here.

264
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:34,583
Can't we set God aside
while I examine them?

265
00:38:34,668 --> 00:38:37,208
You don't set God aside.

266
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:40,376
So what use am I?

267
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:46,418
I'll try talking to them.

268
00:40:08,501 --> 00:40:10,876
Halt! Soviet army!

269
00:40:14,501 --> 00:40:15,501
Get her out!

270
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:18,833
Papers!

271
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,126
Come on!

272
00:40:21,668 --> 00:40:23,876
I'm a French doctor.
- She's French.

273
00:40:25,168 --> 00:40:27,458
Search her.
You, search the van.

274
00:40:28,918 --> 00:40:30,501
Let's go!

275
00:40:30,876 --> 00:40:32,626
Help them search.

276
00:40:43,168 --> 00:40:45,333
Let me take a look.

277
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,833
You're beautiful, you know.

278
00:40:49,168 --> 00:40:50,833
Bravo!

279
00:40:50,918 --> 00:40:52,876
You're so beautiful!

280
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:57,833
Stop!

281
00:40:58,333 --> 00:40:59,583
Yeah...

282
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:16,376
Stop!

283
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:19,168
She loves it!

284
00:41:25,126 --> 00:41:26,251
Step aside.

285
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:30,751
This'll be wild,
I think she wants us all.

286
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:34,043
What's going on here?

287
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:36,376
Get away!

288
00:41:37,626 --> 00:41:39,501
Get back to your posts!

289
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:44,668
Comrade officer...
- Her papers!

290
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:53,918
What are you doing here?

291
00:41:56,126 --> 00:41:57,418
What?

292
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,376
The French Red Cross?

293
00:42:03,418 --> 00:42:04,708
All right.

294
00:42:05,918 --> 00:42:07,293
You can go.

295
00:42:15,918 --> 00:42:18,418
Turn back.
You can't go this way.

296
00:42:18,501 --> 00:42:19,751
Understand?

297
00:42:20,501 --> 00:42:22,293
Go on, turn back!

298
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,668
What's wrong?
Back up!

299
00:42:58,001 --> 00:42:59,958
No one will bother you here.

300
00:43:08,668 --> 00:43:10,793
I'll let the Abbess know.

301
00:45:55,501 --> 00:45:57,458
Run! Hurry!

302
00:45:57,833 --> 00:45:59,793
Quick! Run!

303
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:04,251
Get out of here!

304
00:46:09,376 --> 00:46:12,126
Maria, look after them.

305
00:46:12,208 --> 00:46:14,376
You must look after them.
Go on.

306
00:46:23,168 --> 00:46:24,958
You two, that way!

307
00:46:25,501 --> 00:46:28,083
You're hiding enemies of the people.

308
00:46:28,168 --> 00:46:30,333
We're not hiding anyone.
- We'll check.

309
00:46:30,418 --> 00:46:33,583
You have no right.
- We'll see.

310
00:46:44,043 --> 00:46:45,458
Check there!

311
00:46:46,708 --> 00:46:48,043
And the kitchen!

312
00:46:50,626 --> 00:46:52,668
Come on, hurry it up!

313
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:57,126
Follow me.
- Faster, I said!

314
00:47:01,293 --> 00:47:04,418
There's no one here.
Check the other rooms.

315
00:47:04,501 --> 00:47:05,918
Don't do that.

316
00:47:13,168 --> 00:47:15,293
Do they know
the convent is in quarantine?

317
00:47:16,126 --> 00:47:18,418
Typhus. An epidemic.

318
00:47:18,501 --> 00:47:20,918
What's she saying?
- Typhus?

319
00:47:21,001 --> 00:47:23,168
Yes.
- She's lying.

320
00:47:23,626 --> 00:47:25,208
There is no typhus.

321
00:47:25,293 --> 00:47:29,001
We have to get out of here.
- It's very contagious.

322
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:31,333
Why didn't you alert the authorities?

323
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:33,833
Answer me!

324
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:38,043
How can I know if it's the truth?

325
00:47:38,626 --> 00:47:40,208
They can come to the infirmary.

326
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:45,376
You can go to the infirmary.

327
00:47:46,501 --> 00:47:48,833
We go to the infirmary?
- No way!

328
00:47:48,918 --> 00:47:50,458
We're leaving.

329
00:48:21,501 --> 00:48:22,668
Mother.

330
00:48:24,376 --> 00:48:25,751
I'm tired.

331
00:48:27,293 --> 00:48:29,168
Can I do anything?

332
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:31,833
Are you unwell?

333
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:38,626
Thank you for your... presence of mind.

334
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:52,918
Was she also...

335
00:48:57,458 --> 00:48:59,208
I'll need to examine her.

336
00:49:01,126 --> 00:49:02,833
She'll never let you.

337
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:05,833
She'd rather put up with her ordeal.

338
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:08,668
Isn't pride a sin?

339
00:49:12,043 --> 00:49:13,793
She's our Mother.

340
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:18,126
We cannot judge her,
but merely obey her.

341
00:49:29,001 --> 00:49:30,583
Forgive me.

342
00:49:33,293 --> 00:49:37,458
However much I pray,
I cannot find any consolation.

343
00:49:40,501 --> 00:49:44,668
Every day, I relive what happened.
Every day.

344
00:49:48,501 --> 00:49:50,583
I still smell the stench of them.

345
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:57,251
They came back three times.

346
00:49:58,751 --> 00:50:00,626
Each time, they...

347
00:50:07,668 --> 00:50:10,543
They should have killed us.

348
00:50:12,751 --> 00:50:15,168
It's a miracle they didn't.

349
00:50:31,376 --> 00:50:32,501
Thank you.

350
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:42,083
I've been luckier than others.

351
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:47,083
And I'd already known a man
in my former life.

352
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:52,333
Most of my sisters were virgins.

353
00:50:56,043 --> 00:50:58,293
But none have lost their faith?

354
00:51:00,668 --> 00:51:02,501
You know, faith...

355
00:51:06,751 --> 00:51:09,001
At first, you're like a child

356
00:51:09,543 --> 00:51:12,793
holding your father's hand,
feeling safe.

357
00:51:16,833 --> 00:51:18,583
Then a time comes —

358
00:51:19,668 --> 00:51:21,668
and I think it always comes —

359
00:51:23,918 --> 00:51:25,918
when your father lets go.

360
00:51:28,626 --> 00:51:31,918
You're lost,
alone in the dark.

361
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:34,043
You cry out, but no one answers.

362
00:51:37,293 --> 00:51:38,833
Even if you prepare for it,

363
00:51:41,043 --> 00:51:42,708
you're caught unawares.

364
00:51:43,708 --> 00:51:45,833
It hits you right in the heart.

365
00:51:51,501 --> 00:51:53,376
That's the cross we bear.

366
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:57,333
Behind all joy lies the cross.

367
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:14,918
Mathilde!

368
00:52:16,208 --> 00:52:18,251
Don't abandon us, please!

369
00:52:19,001 --> 00:52:20,583
God bless you.

370
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:23,458
God bless you for everything.

371
00:53:22,501 --> 00:53:25,083
I'm sorry.
- Enough!

372
00:53:26,501 --> 00:53:28,376
I don't need an apology.

373
00:53:28,708 --> 00:53:31,583
You're part of a team under my orders.

374
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:34,418
If you can't bend to discipline,

375
00:53:34,501 --> 00:53:37,251
I'll send you home.
Maybe you want that?

376
00:53:37,668 --> 00:53:39,708
No, sir, definitely not.

377
00:53:40,126 --> 00:53:43,126
You're a real character.
I should jail you.

378
00:53:43,208 --> 00:53:44,501
Sir, it was...

379
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:47,333
You're lucky
the Russians didn't shoot you.

380
00:53:47,751 --> 00:53:49,668
You keep away from that sector.

381
00:53:50,168 --> 00:53:54,543
You ignored orders.
You left us a vehicle short.

382
00:53:59,833 --> 00:54:01,583
You're totally reckless.

383
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:04,333
I'll expect your report.
You may go.

384
00:54:10,376 --> 00:54:12,626
The colonel is a right-winger.

385
00:54:16,501 --> 00:54:17,833
The thing is...

386
00:54:18,168 --> 00:54:21,918
if he finds out
you attend party meetings...

387
00:54:22,001 --> 00:54:23,751
Don't be stupid.

388
00:54:28,918 --> 00:54:30,958
Enough of all this mystery.

389
00:54:32,418 --> 00:54:34,751
Make sure your report is good.

390
00:54:35,751 --> 00:54:39,918
I don't want you sent home.
It would really piss me off.

391
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:44,083
You're kind.
- Me, kind?

392
00:54:44,918 --> 00:54:46,751
Don't you know me?

393
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:49,876
Would it really upset you?

394
00:54:49,958 --> 00:54:51,958
Don't go imagining things.

395
00:54:52,043 --> 00:54:55,418
I mean work-wise.
You're an excellent assistant.

396
00:54:55,751 --> 00:55:00,168
I don't want to lose you.
Even if I know you're a Communist.

397
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:02,333
Not a party member.

398
00:55:02,418 --> 00:55:05,876
Maybe, but you believe
in a brighter tomorrow.

399
00:55:06,293 --> 00:55:09,251
We have to believe.
- Really?

400
00:55:12,168 --> 00:55:13,543
What?

401
00:55:14,501 --> 00:55:17,168
What's hidden
behind that forehead?

402
00:55:17,251 --> 00:55:19,958
My forehead doesn't interest you.
- No.

403
00:55:20,708 --> 00:55:22,418
What's beneath it does.

404
00:55:22,918 --> 00:55:24,668
There's nothing beneath it.

405
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:42,958
Any plans for tonight?

406
00:55:43,501 --> 00:55:45,418
I need to sleep. I'm tired.

407
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:49,708
You're a pitiful liar.

408
00:56:34,001 --> 00:56:37,083
I can't come by day anymore.
I'm being watched.

409
00:56:50,376 --> 00:56:51,833
Have a listen.

410
00:56:54,626 --> 00:56:55,918
Without your hands.

411
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:02,543
It's beating so fast!

412
00:57:03,293 --> 00:57:05,958
They say a rapid heartbeat
is a girl.

413
00:57:07,043 --> 00:57:08,543
Probably a girl.

414
00:57:11,668 --> 00:57:15,168
Sister,
our Reverend Mother feels unwell.

415
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:18,543
I have to see the Abbess.

416
00:57:18,626 --> 00:57:20,208
Thank you, Sister.

417
00:57:27,418 --> 00:57:29,833
Do you have a lover in France?

418
00:57:30,418 --> 00:57:33,251
Lots of them.
- Really?

419
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:34,793
Lie down.

420
00:57:35,168 --> 00:57:38,501
You're very curious.
- Yes, I am.

421
00:57:38,583 --> 00:57:42,833
I have many flaws.
I deserve the harshest penance.

422
00:57:45,418 --> 00:57:47,418
I've never had much faith.

423
00:57:47,501 --> 00:57:51,333
And since this happened,
I've lost the little I had.

424
00:57:51,418 --> 00:57:53,251
I shouldn't be here.

425
00:57:53,876 --> 00:57:55,833
So why don't you leave?

426
00:57:56,418 --> 00:57:57,918
I have no family left,

427
00:57:58,001 --> 00:58:00,958
apart from the bigoted aunt
who sent me here.

428
00:58:03,668 --> 00:58:05,626
After the delivery,

429
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:08,833
I'll go to find my fiancé,
wherever he may be.

430
00:58:09,668 --> 00:58:11,001
You have a fiancé?

431
00:58:11,083 --> 00:58:14,418
Yes, I keep thinking about him,
but can't tell anyone.

432
00:58:14,501 --> 00:58:15,958
I'd be punished.

433
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:19,708
Is he the Russian soldier
who got you in this condition?

434
00:58:23,168 --> 00:58:25,293
He defended me from the others.

435
00:58:25,583 --> 00:58:28,418
He protected me.
He even fought them.

436
00:58:28,958 --> 00:58:30,833
He stopped them from killing us.

437
00:58:35,043 --> 00:58:37,458
Excuse me.
Can you come with me?

438
00:58:39,001 --> 00:58:40,333
Thank you.

439
00:58:41,001 --> 00:58:43,418
Get dressed
and go back to your cell.

440
00:59:00,001 --> 00:59:02,876
Mother, let her examine you.

441
00:59:17,001 --> 00:59:18,333
May I?

442
00:59:31,043 --> 00:59:34,501
There are lesions.
I'll do a test to be sure.

443
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:36,126
A test?

444
00:59:37,333 --> 00:59:39,418
It's advanced syphilis.

445
00:59:39,751 --> 00:59:42,083
I can get the medicine to treat it.

446
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:46,333
I don't need you to treat it.

447
01:00:00,001 --> 01:00:02,583
What if several births occur at once?

448
01:00:05,126 --> 01:00:08,626
I know.
I'm scared of that happening.

449
01:00:10,958 --> 01:00:12,293
Thank you.

450
01:00:14,001 --> 01:00:16,126
We've been scared for five years.

451
01:00:18,251 --> 01:00:23,001
For us nuns, the end of the war
doesn't mean the end of fear.

452
01:00:25,168 --> 01:00:27,833
The new regime won't do us any favors.

453
01:00:33,668 --> 01:00:34,876
And you?

454
01:00:36,001 --> 01:00:38,333
Haven't you ever feared for your life?

455
01:00:38,418 --> 01:00:39,668
Me?

456
01:00:40,793 --> 01:00:45,251
When I joined the Red Cross team,
I was still a student.

457
01:00:46,251 --> 01:00:49,208
I ended up carrying stretchers
under fire

458
01:00:49,293 --> 01:00:50,876
when Paris was liberated.

459
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:56,876
Sorry, but I pissed myself
more than once.

460
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:03,876
But I've never regretted it.

461
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:07,583
And I imagined
I would save lives.

462
01:01:14,626 --> 01:01:17,043
Novice Irena is in a good mood.

463
01:03:48,668 --> 01:03:51,001
How can a baby arrive like that?

464
01:03:53,918 --> 01:03:55,626
Without us realizing?

465
01:03:56,626 --> 01:03:58,918
An extreme defensive reaction.

466
01:04:01,918 --> 01:04:05,458
The body resists
and no one can guess her condition,

467
01:04:05,793 --> 01:04:07,208
not even the patient herself.

468
01:04:10,668 --> 01:04:12,208
Could...

469
01:04:13,251 --> 01:04:15,083
Could there be others?

470
01:04:16,333 --> 01:04:17,668
Possibly.

471
01:04:18,668 --> 01:04:20,458
What are we going to do?

472
01:04:21,793 --> 01:04:23,833
How should I know?

473
01:04:26,418 --> 01:04:30,333
I'll notify the Abbess.
- Don't disturb her now.

474
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:34,043
I have to inform her of each birth.

475
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:37,208
She takes the babies to the adopters.

476
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:42,833
I don't think she realizes
how fragile a newborn is.

477
01:04:43,958 --> 01:04:46,001
It's my duty to obey.

478
01:04:46,833 --> 01:04:48,583
You have a higher duty...

479
01:04:49,126 --> 01:04:51,333
Protecting this child's life.

480
01:04:53,918 --> 01:04:57,043
I should lie to her?
- Through omission.

481
01:04:58,501 --> 01:05:00,376
Not for long.
Heaven will thank you.

482
01:05:01,001 --> 01:05:03,668
It's easy for a non-believer
to talk of Heaven.

483
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:07,501
We have to feed her.

484
01:05:11,501 --> 01:05:12,833
Sister...

485
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:26,168
Novice Ludwika rejected her.

486
01:06:29,376 --> 01:06:32,168
You can wear this.
- Is it yours?

487
01:06:33,458 --> 01:06:36,833
I arrived here in that dress.
- It's pretty.

488
01:06:37,751 --> 01:06:39,333
I was stylish then.

489
01:06:41,793 --> 01:06:43,751
I liked men and men liked me.

490
01:06:59,918 --> 01:07:02,126
Don't you ever regret it?

491
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:08,333
Faith is twenty-four hours of doubt
and one minute of hope.

492
01:07:11,668 --> 01:07:14,418
At first,
I found the discipline hard to take.

493
01:07:15,918 --> 01:07:17,668
Chastity too.

494
01:07:20,793 --> 01:07:24,668
I know happiness isn't the goal
that we pursue but...

495
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:28,418
without the war...

496
01:07:29,793 --> 01:07:31,958
without the horror that has struck us...

497
01:07:33,458 --> 01:07:35,793
I could say I'm happy.

498
01:07:36,668 --> 01:07:38,168
You're lucky.

499
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:43,793
Aren't you?

500
01:07:45,668 --> 01:07:47,001
I don't know.

501
01:07:53,626 --> 01:07:55,208
What are you lacking?

502
01:07:57,583 --> 01:07:59,251
You want to convert me?

503
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:03,293
It's an honest question.

504
01:08:12,376 --> 01:08:14,668
No one can really answer that.

505
01:08:17,333 --> 01:08:19,001
No one in the outside world.

506
01:08:43,626 --> 01:08:45,042
Cigarette?

507
01:09:07,792 --> 01:09:11,542
I haven't always had good news
for you here,

508
01:09:11,626 --> 01:09:14,333
but this will delight you.

509
01:09:14,708 --> 01:09:17,708
We pack up and leave
at the end of the month.

510
01:09:18,833 --> 01:09:22,583
The luckier ones will return
to good old France.

511
01:09:22,667 --> 01:09:25,458
The others, me included,
are transferred to Berlin,

512
01:09:25,542 --> 01:09:27,251
to the French sector.

513
01:09:27,333 --> 01:09:31,042
Don't ask me why. I have no idea.
Those are the orders.

514
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,001
Any questions?

515
01:09:36,292 --> 01:09:38,417
Sir...
- Lehmann, you go with me.

516
01:09:38,501 --> 01:09:42,626
It's not that, but perhaps
it's too soon to end our mission.

517
01:09:42,708 --> 01:09:45,333
Will you miss it?
- No, sir.

518
01:09:46,542 --> 01:09:49,583
Have we recovered all our wounded?
- Affirmative.

519
01:09:49,667 --> 01:09:54,083
Despite Soviet harassment,
mission accomplished.

520
01:09:54,167 --> 01:09:57,126
Satisfied now?
- Yes, sir.

521
01:10:07,917 --> 01:10:09,501
It's sad.

522
01:10:10,501 --> 01:10:11,833
What's sad?

523
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:15,833
We part ways at the end of the month.

524
01:10:16,458 --> 01:10:18,292
You'll return to your folks

525
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:21,083
that you must miss so much.

526
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:25,958
Maybe you don't give a damn...

527
01:10:28,001 --> 01:10:30,626
but I can't help thinking
we won't meet again.

528
01:10:32,501 --> 01:10:35,208
We'll write.
- Yes, of course.

529
01:10:36,501 --> 01:10:38,333
Postcards...

530
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:42,667
What's wrong?

531
01:10:43,751 --> 01:10:46,042
You don't like postcards?

532
01:10:48,083 --> 01:10:49,501
I'm sorry.

533
01:10:50,917 --> 01:10:54,083
I've never seen you cry.
I didn't think you could.

534
01:10:56,583 --> 01:11:00,626
Put my mind at rest...
It's not because we have to part?

535
01:11:07,376 --> 01:11:08,458
What then?

536
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:14,167
You can trust me, you know.

537
01:11:16,251 --> 01:11:17,626
Talk to me.

538
01:11:18,126 --> 01:11:19,542
It's nothing.

539
01:11:22,417 --> 01:11:25,583
Keep your secrets.
I'm going to dance.

540
01:13:34,501 --> 01:13:35,876
It's so heavy!

541
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:25,958
Stay calm.

542
01:14:31,417 --> 01:14:33,751
Mathilde Beaulieu, please.
It's urgent.

543
01:14:46,542 --> 01:14:48,667
Samuel, I need you.

544
01:14:49,167 --> 01:14:50,583
What's going on?

545
01:14:50,667 --> 01:14:52,708
Just listen.
- Come on.

546
01:15:05,458 --> 01:15:07,167
I haven't come alone.

547
01:15:11,208 --> 01:15:13,376
Fear not, I'm here to help you.

548
01:15:29,417 --> 01:15:31,501
This is Dr. Samuel Lehmann.

549
01:15:35,126 --> 01:15:36,833
Yes, I'm Jewish.

550
01:15:37,501 --> 01:15:39,458
There are a few of us left.

551
01:15:40,792 --> 01:15:43,417
Now that's settled,
where are the patients?

552
01:15:43,833 --> 01:15:45,833
He'll keep your secret.

553
01:15:49,292 --> 01:15:52,542
How many doctors will you bring?
- I wasn't expecting him.

554
01:15:52,626 --> 01:15:55,208
Don't you realize the danger?

555
01:15:55,292 --> 01:15:57,626
We can talk here for hours.

556
01:15:57,708 --> 01:16:00,001
Women are suffering
and in danger.

557
01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:03,917
I'm not baptized, I won't go to Heaven,
but I'm a doctor.

558
01:16:04,001 --> 01:16:06,333
I don't need this.
If we're unwelcome,

559
01:16:06,417 --> 01:16:08,333
say so and we'll leave.

560
01:16:08,667 --> 01:16:09,917
That suits me.

561
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,126
If someone had told me

562
01:16:21,208 --> 01:16:25,042
I'd end up delivering Polish nuns
knocked up by Soviet grunts...

563
01:16:42,876 --> 01:16:44,917
How long will this last?

564
01:16:45,001 --> 01:16:47,626
They pray three times at the Angelus.

565
01:17:01,458 --> 01:17:02,667
Stay calm.

566
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,542
It's all right.

567
01:17:42,667 --> 01:17:43,917
Not just yet.

568
01:17:48,001 --> 01:17:50,542
Tell her to keep breathing deeply.

569
01:17:53,833 --> 01:17:56,208
Come and see Novice Ludwika's baby.

570
01:18:17,833 --> 01:18:19,458
Everything's normal.

571
01:18:24,376 --> 01:18:25,833
Pretty, isn't she?

572
01:18:27,542 --> 01:18:29,667
Her name's Helena.

573
01:18:32,126 --> 01:18:34,292
That's the name I chose.
She'll be baptized.

574
01:18:39,542 --> 01:18:41,042
Her name's Helena.

575
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:45,208
I think you have to go.

576
01:18:48,417 --> 01:18:50,208
Can you hold her?

577
01:19:13,376 --> 01:19:16,626
I'll take her to Ludwika's family tomorrow.

578
01:19:16,708 --> 01:19:19,667
And then I'll tell our Mother the truth.

579
01:19:40,583 --> 01:19:42,042
Come to my office.

580
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:09,333
Sit down.

581
01:20:11,083 --> 01:20:14,042
Please,
punish me rather than Ludwika.

582
01:20:14,583 --> 01:20:18,167
She didn't lie,
she isn't even aware she gave birth.

583
01:20:18,251 --> 01:20:20,167
It's entirely my fault.
- No.

584
01:20:21,001 --> 01:20:23,376
You're lying for that French woman.

585
01:20:25,292 --> 01:20:29,708
I was right to be wary of her.
She has brought scandal and disorder.

586
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:34,001
Forgive me, but scandal
and disorder were already here.

587
01:20:34,083 --> 01:20:35,376
Enough!

588
01:25:02,917 --> 01:25:04,501
Sister Zofia?

589
01:25:07,667 --> 01:25:09,292
What's wrong?

590
01:25:09,876 --> 01:25:13,126
I looked for her,
but I couldn't find her...

591
01:25:13,542 --> 01:25:16,251
Who?
- Help me, Sister!

592
01:25:16,333 --> 01:25:17,792
I don't understand.

593
01:25:17,876 --> 01:25:19,958
We have to go.
- Where?

594
01:25:20,042 --> 01:25:22,583
She'll die. Helena will die.

595
01:25:24,501 --> 01:25:26,167
Let's go to your cell.

596
01:25:39,542 --> 01:25:43,376
I beseech You to open
the gates of Your kingdom to me,

597
01:25:44,876 --> 01:25:48,208
to give me the courage
to follow the path I have chosen...

598
01:25:55,501 --> 01:25:58,251
to help me bear this heavy cross.

599
01:26:03,167 --> 01:26:04,667
Help me.

600
01:26:16,626 --> 01:26:17,833
Here.

601
01:26:57,833 --> 01:27:01,458
Do you have sugar
to make hot drinks for the mothers?

602
01:27:02,167 --> 01:27:04,501
I'll go and see.
- Thank you.

603
01:27:26,083 --> 01:27:27,708
Zofia!

604
01:28:58,792 --> 01:28:59,792
Are you OK?

605
01:29:07,792 --> 01:29:09,417
It's not your fault.

606
01:29:11,876 --> 01:29:15,501
You did what you had to do.
The rest is destiny.

607
01:29:17,667 --> 01:29:19,083
You know...

608
01:29:20,083 --> 01:29:23,001
not many could've done
what you did.

609
01:29:23,751 --> 01:29:27,208
Even more qualified people
would have panicked.

610
01:31:30,251 --> 01:31:32,208
Mom!

611
01:31:41,958 --> 01:31:44,876
What is it?
- Someone's here.

612
01:31:53,667 --> 01:31:55,042
God protect you.

613
01:31:58,001 --> 01:32:00,001
I have some very bad news.

614
01:32:01,417 --> 01:32:03,167
Sister Zofia is dead.

615
01:32:05,501 --> 01:32:07,958
She passed away yesterday.
I'm sorry.

616
01:32:09,583 --> 01:32:11,208
Oh, my God!

617
01:32:25,501 --> 01:32:26,958
I'm sorry.

618
01:32:30,751 --> 01:32:34,083
Sister Zofia made these for the baby.

619
01:32:35,667 --> 01:32:37,708
What baby?

620
01:32:38,583 --> 01:32:40,417
All my children are grown.

621
01:32:41,667 --> 01:32:42,958
But the baby...

622
01:32:46,542 --> 01:32:47,626
Forgive me.

623
01:32:48,501 --> 01:32:50,001
May God protect you.

624
01:33:04,542 --> 01:33:08,167
Mother, I beseech you,
tell me the truth.

625
01:33:09,001 --> 01:33:11,167
What did you do with the child?

626
01:33:17,167 --> 01:33:19,251
What I had to.
- Meaning?

627
01:33:19,333 --> 01:33:21,458
I entrusted him to God.

628
01:33:21,542 --> 01:33:23,667
I don't understand!
- You don't?

629
01:33:24,708 --> 01:33:26,667
Don't you believe in Providence?

630
01:33:27,833 --> 01:33:29,042
I do.

631
01:33:29,126 --> 01:33:31,792
I believe it embraced
those children.

632
01:33:32,501 --> 01:33:34,667
What did you do?
- What I could!

633
01:33:34,751 --> 01:33:36,708
I want to be alone! Get out!

634
01:33:38,333 --> 01:33:39,417
Get out.

635
01:34:33,333 --> 01:34:36,542
Sister, I think Irena is giving birth.

636
01:34:45,542 --> 01:34:47,083
Make an effort.

637
01:34:49,501 --> 01:34:51,042
Don't be afraid.

638
01:35:00,083 --> 01:35:01,417
A little more.

639
01:35:07,667 --> 01:35:08,958
It's coming.

640
01:35:09,042 --> 01:35:10,376
Keep pushing...

641
01:35:12,333 --> 01:35:13,417
Yes!

642
01:35:20,208 --> 01:35:23,083
Sister, a little more, please.

643
01:35:25,833 --> 01:35:27,083
It's coming.

644
01:37:08,792 --> 01:37:12,792
It's silly. I keep thinking
in a few days, you'll forget me.

645
01:37:16,001 --> 01:37:18,126
I wish I could say as much.

646
01:37:23,501 --> 01:37:25,458
You're getting sentimental.

647
01:37:27,292 --> 01:37:29,376
Been drinking?
- No.

648
01:37:30,667 --> 01:37:33,208
It's silly,
but I fear you'll forget me.

649
01:37:34,876 --> 01:37:36,126
Let's bet on it.

650
01:37:36,667 --> 01:37:37,751
Come on.

651
01:37:38,001 --> 01:37:39,626
May I butt in?

652
01:38:12,292 --> 01:38:13,458
Help us.

653
01:39:44,626 --> 01:39:48,708
Last night, I found the answer
to the question tormenting me.

654
01:39:49,126 --> 01:39:50,667
What question?

655
01:39:53,167 --> 01:39:54,708
I'm a mother.

656
01:39:58,833 --> 01:40:00,501
I always will be.

657
01:40:04,458 --> 01:40:06,001
He's my child.

658
01:40:07,167 --> 01:40:08,876
He has a right to my love.

659
01:40:09,333 --> 01:40:10,583
What does that mean?

660
01:40:10,958 --> 01:40:14,376
It means
I shall pursue my vocation differently.

661
01:40:19,251 --> 01:40:20,958
God will guide me.

662
01:40:23,917 --> 01:40:25,792
I owe you so much.

663
01:40:27,542 --> 01:40:29,333
I'll never forget that.

664
01:40:31,042 --> 01:40:32,126
Thank you.

665
01:40:46,083 --> 01:40:47,501
I've had an idea.

666
01:41:54,333 --> 01:41:55,583
Sisters...

667
01:41:57,251 --> 01:41:58,251
Mother...

668
01:41:59,542 --> 01:42:02,001
Listen to us for a minute.

669
01:42:06,251 --> 01:42:08,876
These orphans live on the streets.

670
01:42:11,501 --> 01:42:14,001
You could take them in.

671
01:42:16,417 --> 01:42:19,708
That way, no one will wonder
where your babies come from.

672
01:42:23,626 --> 01:42:26,667
You can keep them
and raise them without fear.

673
01:42:43,751 --> 01:42:44,958
Sister...

674
01:42:53,042 --> 01:42:57,458
But our Mother has found families
for all the babies.

675
01:42:57,542 --> 01:42:58,833
Haven't you?

676
01:43:14,583 --> 01:43:16,042
Mother, speak, please.

677
01:43:30,251 --> 01:43:33,167
I wanted
to spare you shame and dishonor.

678
01:43:37,583 --> 01:43:40,751
I damned myself to save you.

679
01:44:19,458 --> 01:44:21,083
Murderer...

680
01:45:58,667 --> 01:45:59,708
Thank you.

681
01:46:09,501 --> 01:46:10,792
Got a cigarette?

682
01:46:11,251 --> 01:46:13,083
Here.
- Thank you.

683
01:46:29,708 --> 01:46:31,251
And your child?

684
01:46:32,167 --> 01:46:34,126
They'll take good care of him.

685
01:46:34,917 --> 01:46:36,501
I wouldn't have known how.

686
01:46:40,126 --> 01:46:41,917
I want to forget all that.

687
01:46:43,542 --> 01:46:45,251
I want to live.

688
01:47:03,667 --> 01:47:06,583
Three months later

689
01:48:08,833 --> 01:48:10,042
Mother...

690
01:48:11,083 --> 01:48:13,501
What can I do for you?

691
01:49:24,042 --> 01:49:25,667
<i>Dear Mathilde,</i>

692
01:49:25,751 --> 01:49:28,376
<i>The dark clouds have moved on.</i>

693
01:49:28,458 --> 01:49:30,876
<i>The sun shines brightly in our sky.</i>

694
01:49:31,208 --> 01:49:34,167
<i>And you are in our hearts.</i>

695
01:49:36,833 --> 01:49:39,208
<i>Perhaps other wars will come.</i>

696
01:49:39,958 --> 01:49:42,167
<i>Other dangers threaten us.</i>

697
01:49:42,251 --> 01:49:44,708
<i>It will soon be harder
to write to each other.</i>

698
01:49:45,792 --> 01:49:48,208
<i>But whatever fate awaits us,</i>

699
01:49:48,292 --> 01:49:50,626
<i>I feel ready to face it.</i>

700
01:49:51,833 --> 01:49:54,583
<i>I know,
even if it makes you laugh,</i>

701
01:49:54,667 --> 01:49:56,458
<i>that God sent you.</i>

702
01:49:58,001 --> 01:50:00,708
<i>May He accompany you in your trials</i>

703
01:50:00,792 --> 01:50:02,917
<i>and may you always be joyful.</i>

704
01:50:03,001 --> 01:50:04,792
<i>Yours, Maria.</i>

705
01:50:05,305 --> 01:51:05,260
