3
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,691
All right!

4
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:31,070
I know, I know, I know.

5
00:04:31,122 --> 00:04:34,870
A gun! It's dangerous for
no one except you.

6
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:37,719
You know what I want,
don't you?

7
00:04:37,816 --> 00:04:38,957
Yes.

8
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:42,170
You're wasting time.
Don't fuck with me!

9
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:45,339
Open it. Open it!

10
00:05:00,527 --> 00:05:01,807
Open it!

11
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:12,948
Give me what I want. - I don't
understand, I don't have anything else.

12
00:05:12,998 --> 00:05:15,667
If the man's offering you
all that money, I'd take it.

13
00:05:16,626 --> 00:05:19,877
When I need financial advice,
I'll call my broker.

14
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:21,961
I'm just saying, is all.
- Whatever.

15
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:24,759
Take off your coat.
Take off your coat!

16
00:05:36,105 --> 00:05:38,940
Now, how hard was that?
- Excuse me.

17
00:05:38,982 --> 00:05:41,355
Mister, I thought I told...

18
00:05:45,572 --> 00:05:46,604
What the?

19
00:05:52,037 --> 00:05:54,279
Go, go! Move! Everybody down!

20
00:05:56,584 --> 00:05:58,078
Move! Move!

21
00:05:58,127 --> 00:06:00,452
Move!

22
00:06:13,226 --> 00:06:14,340
Go, go, go!

23
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:18,520
Suspect white or Hispanic male.
Wearing a reflective vest.

24
00:06:18,564 --> 00:06:20,972
He's on top of the cars.
All units at Vernon Jackson.

25
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,739
Everybody down!

26
00:06:32,996 --> 00:06:34,158
Other end!

27
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:51,385
Everybody down!
Keep moving! Keep moving!

28
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,304
Move, move! Everybody down!
Face down on the platform!

29
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:37,676
Come on, face down!
Everybody off the train!

30
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:40,599
Come on, face down! Get down!

31
00:07:44,068 --> 00:07:45,183
Officer...
- Move!

32
00:07:45,236 --> 00:07:47,228
Come on, guys, get down!

33
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,687
Now! Face down! Get down!

34
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,741
Get down! Search the tracks!

35
00:07:52,785 --> 00:07:56,236
He went down the tunnel?
Check the tunnel, check the roof.

36
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:05,370
Come on, people!
Face down on the ground now!

37
00:08:05,423 --> 00:08:08,294
He jumped! He was on the roof!

38
00:08:08,343 --> 00:08:11,842
This train is closed. Nobody gets on.

39
00:08:11,888 --> 00:08:14,094
Sir, I need you to calm down.

40
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,133
Get these people moving.

41
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:27,603
Stop right there.

42
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,482
The punk's got balls...

43
00:08:32,534 --> 00:08:34,776
but no positive identification.

44
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:37,864
No. There's another camera
pointing at the platform.

45
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:45,421
Michaels, stop it right there.

46
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:48,960
You see what I see?

47
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:51,547
Maybe.
- That's him, lieutenant.

48
00:08:51,595 --> 00:08:52,674
That's who?

49
00:08:52,721 --> 00:08:55,722
How long have you been a detective?
- 11 months, sir.

50
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:57,593
I'm 22 years in robbery and homicide.

51
00:08:57,643 --> 00:09:00,893
One of your subcategories
of robbery is art theft.

52
00:09:00,938 --> 00:09:04,307
There's a lot of that in the Apple.
Are you aware of that, Michaels?

53
00:09:04,358 --> 00:09:05,982
I guess so, yeah.
- I wasn't.

54
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:08,778
When I was your age, I was happy
with regular murder and mayhem.

55
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:11,490
Lieutenant Weber
minored in art history at Fordham.

56
00:09:11,532 --> 00:09:12,563
Oh.

57
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:15,487
Anyway, the Chief
starts calling me Lieutenant Picasso

58
00:09:15,536 --> 00:09:18,288
and puts me in charge
every time there is the theft

59
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,825
of as much as an Etch A Sketch.

60
00:09:19,874 --> 00:09:23,871
Two decades,
I've been putting 'em all away.

61
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,671
Everybody but him, Keith Ripley.

62
00:09:26,714 --> 00:09:29,999
He's the best there is. Howdy, Keith.

63
00:09:58,913 --> 00:10:00,158
You've been bad boy.

64
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:06,418
Perhaps I could give you 15.
- No.

65
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,123
That is not possible.

66
00:10:08,173 --> 00:10:09,881
I wouldn't take less than 100.

67
00:10:12,302 --> 00:10:14,757
I'm just saying, is all.

68
00:10:14,804 --> 00:10:17,130
You...
- Mind if I borrow this?

69
00:10:18,141 --> 00:10:21,593
Well, I may have wanted to use it.
- Mm.

70
00:10:21,645 --> 00:10:23,222
But yours will do!

71
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:25,898
Will you please put down my gun?

72
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:28,895
There's one thing
you should be aware of, Gabriel,

73
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:31,351
or do you prefer Seסor Martin?

74
00:10:31,405 --> 00:10:34,109
The police cannot arrest you
for armed robbery,

75
00:10:34,157 --> 00:10:35,616
if your gun isn't loaded.

76
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:36,857
Your point?

77
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,615
You think I'd walk around
with a loaded shotgun?

78
00:10:39,663 --> 00:10:41,572
Let's see.

79
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:45,495
You could have checked.
- Why?

80
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:49,043
You have my diamonds,
my score, my money.

81
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:51,794
Enjoy! Nice meeting you both! Bye!

82
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:56,383
By the way,
I was going to ask for 125.

83
00:10:57,514 --> 00:11:00,302
I am just saying, is all.

84
00:11:00,351 --> 00:11:02,427
Gabriel, stay.
- Why?

85
00:11:02,478 --> 00:11:05,265
What else do you want?
You gonna shoot me now?

86
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:08,855
Well, in as much as
you did steal the diamonds,

87
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:12,400
I figure it's only fair
to share the proceeds with you.

88
00:11:12,446 --> 00:11:15,068
So to what do I owe
this act of generosity?

89
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:19,743
I have a proposition
I wish to discuss with you.

90
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,369
So...

91
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,541
how did you know
I would come here,

92
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:28,997
as well as my name?

93
00:11:29,046 --> 00:11:30,706
It's part of the proposition...

94
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:34,800
Oh, shit!

95
00:11:36,054 --> 00:11:39,008
Come on!
- All right, take it easy, take it easy.

96
00:11:40,683 --> 00:11:42,343
Nicky would like his money.

97
00:11:44,062 --> 00:11:45,971
Ask him.
- Thank you!

98
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,104
This is between you and them!
Got nothing to do with me!

99
00:11:51,152 --> 00:11:53,275
Everything does now.

100
00:11:55,657 --> 00:11:58,777
Call this interest.
Nicky is tired of waiting for you.

101
00:12:09,713 --> 00:12:12,038
You must have very bad karma.

102
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,044
I actually don't believe in it.
Still, about this propo...

103
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:18,961
No, no, no, no!
You are totally out of your mind!

104
00:12:19,014 --> 00:12:20,638
Good night!

105
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:26,604
Hey.
- What?

106
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:28,604
Here's your karma.

107
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:35,530
What was in the other envelope?
- Your cut.

108
00:12:38,617 --> 00:12:39,946
Now you've got mine.

109
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,359
Whatever.

110
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:46,119
Think about it.
- Yeah, sure, yeah.

111
00:13:12,652 --> 00:13:14,312
Hmm.

112
00:13:18,032 --> 00:13:20,440
Now... what do you want?

113
00:13:22,245 --> 00:13:23,739
A partner.

114
00:13:24,998 --> 00:13:26,990
What do you think
I was doing on that train?

115
00:13:27,876 --> 00:13:30,627
I was watching you work.
- Hm.

116
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,121
I've been your shadow
ever since you got to town.

117
00:13:34,174 --> 00:13:38,006
So why were you in my town
robbing subways?

118
00:13:39,054 --> 00:13:42,470
It's hurricane season in Miami.
I don't like hurricanes.

119
00:13:42,515 --> 00:13:45,433
Or you didn't feel like
going back to Angola.

120
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,096
It's over. Lesson learned.

121
00:13:49,147 --> 00:13:50,522
Look...

122
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:52,439
Gabriel Martin is a rock star.

123
00:13:52,484 --> 00:13:56,731
So why were you holding
open-mike night on the subway

124
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,440
for a lousy 100 grand?

125
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:01,196
Two reasons.

126
00:14:01,243 --> 00:14:03,734
Yes, Miami was getting too hot.

127
00:14:03,787 --> 00:14:06,195
And perhaps you can relate to this.

128
00:14:07,082 --> 00:14:08,362
Sometimes...

129
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,452
Sometimes you just need
to feel the rush.

130
00:14:15,215 --> 00:14:17,172
The juice.

131
00:14:17,217 --> 00:14:18,759
Yeah.

132
00:14:18,802 --> 00:14:20,296
You know what I mean.

133
00:14:21,597 --> 00:14:23,673
Yesterday,
you took down two jewellers

134
00:14:23,724 --> 00:14:25,800
for a few stones from Romanov's.

135
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:29,640
My idea is Romanov's itself.

136
00:14:29,688 --> 00:14:32,014
Please!

137
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:36,527
Specifically, two Fabergי eggs
worth $20 million.

138
00:14:37,863 --> 00:14:39,488
Each.

139
00:14:41,784 --> 00:14:43,575
It's a two-man job.

140
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:47,405
Do I have your attention?

141
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,719
Wait here.

142
00:15:12,398 --> 00:15:15,767
I hear they prefer cash...
or your first-born.

143
00:15:40,427 --> 00:15:42,716
Why don't you try
The Standard instead?

144
00:15:47,184 --> 00:15:49,176
Jealous?

145
00:15:49,227 --> 00:15:50,508
Of who?

146
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:53,849
The mystery bandit.

147
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:56,437
I'm afraid that type of thing
is not my style.

148
00:15:57,736 --> 00:16:01,864
Well, I think this guy's
got panache, guts.

149
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:06,617
And a passing resemblance,
at least in body type.

150
00:16:08,455 --> 00:16:11,706
Well, you don't have
to rob trains to have panache.

151
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,247
Or guts. But you've gotta admit that
kind of thing immediately brands you.

152
00:16:21,177 --> 00:16:24,842
My treat. Too painful watching you
attempt to read Cyrillic.

153
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:27,973
Oh, no, no, no.
I was just looking at the picture.

154
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:29,345
So you are jealous.

155
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:34,348
Yes. You got me there. Absolutely.

156
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:40,397
I've gotta get
this Chinese food to my boss

157
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:42,486
so, um...

158
00:16:42,532 --> 00:16:44,571
some other time.

159
00:16:44,617 --> 00:16:47,488
When some other time?
- I'll call you.

160
00:16:47,537 --> 00:16:50,657
But you don't have my number
or know my name or anything.

161
00:16:50,707 --> 00:16:52,117
I guess that could be a problem.

162
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,281
Gabriel!

163
00:16:55,169 --> 00:16:56,712
Oh, shit!
- Are you with him?

164
00:16:56,754 --> 00:16:58,913
I don't know. Should I? More or less.

165
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:01,373
Er... yes, I am.

166
00:17:01,426 --> 00:17:02,920
What do you want?

167
00:17:04,095 --> 00:17:06,467
Can't I bring my goddaughter
a birthday present?

168
00:17:06,514 --> 00:17:07,973
My birthday was last month.

169
00:17:08,016 --> 00:17:10,589
It was two weeks ago
and I'm sorry it's late.

170
00:17:10,644 --> 00:17:14,309
Alex, it's just a present.
No strings.

171
00:17:15,857 --> 00:17:16,888
No thanks.

172
00:17:19,277 --> 00:17:21,400
It was nice to have
almost met you, Gabriel.

173
00:17:22,322 --> 00:17:24,113
Gaby.
- Gaby.

174
00:17:24,825 --> 00:17:27,494
It's a shame you don't keep
a higher class of company.

175
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:37,910
Don't even think about it.
- Think about what?

176
00:17:37,963 --> 00:17:41,047
Going anywhere near her.
I'll rip your heart out. I mean it.

177
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:44,460
It looks like it's your heart
she's not so fond of.

178
00:17:45,804 --> 00:17:47,464
You were warned. Let's go.

179
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,591
I thought you said
the target was Romanov's.

180
00:17:50,642 --> 00:17:53,643
This is research.
- Research?

181
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:55,229
Oh, wow!

182
00:18:00,611 --> 00:18:02,687
They're absolutely stunning.

183
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:07,406
They are.

184
00:18:07,451 --> 00:18:10,322
Between 1885 and 1916,

185
00:18:10,371 --> 00:18:13,656
Fabergי produced 50
of these Easter eggs for the Empress

186
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,281
and her daughter-in-law,
the Czarina Alexandra.

187
00:18:16,335 --> 00:18:18,244
Should I take notes?

188
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:20,205
Will there be a quiz?

189
00:18:20,256 --> 00:18:23,506
No quiz but there will be a test.

190
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:29,174
OK. The Fabergיs are all made
of precious metals and fine jewels.

191
00:18:29,223 --> 00:18:33,007
Every one a unique masterpiece.
- Indeed.

192
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:35,386
Most are on display in the Kremlin.

193
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:39,270
The rest in private collections,
museums or lost.

194
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:41,808
In this case, at Romanov's.

195
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,943
Who is your buyer?

196
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:46,649
You don't want to know.

197
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:49,985
Oh, I'm stealing $40 million worth
of eggs so I want to know.

198
00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:52,574
I also want to know
why these particular eggs

199
00:18:52,622 --> 00:18:54,282
are even worth $40 million.

200
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:58,247
Because no one knows they exist.

201
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:00,462
Oh.

202
00:19:00,505 --> 00:19:03,542
The so-called mystery eggs?
- Mm-hm.

203
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:07,672
Yeah, I've heard rumours,
but I thought it was just a myth.

204
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:12,383
Last year, they turned up.
At Romanov's.

205
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:14,261
So how do you know this?

206
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:19,103
I was partners with a man named
Victor Korolenko. Alex's father.

207
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:20,976
He was in tight with the Russians.

208
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,813
What they knew, he knew.

209
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,614
So why aren't you
pulling this job with him?

210
00:19:26,657 --> 00:19:29,444
Let's just say he's no longer around.

211
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:31,735
Leave it at that.

212
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,494
He's gone.

213
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,085
You're here.

214
00:19:40,754 --> 00:19:42,414
Now we just have to deliver.

215
00:19:45,176 --> 00:19:47,631
Ripley...
- Hmm?

216
00:19:47,678 --> 00:19:48,709
Why?

217
00:19:50,264 --> 00:19:51,806
Why risk your freedom at all?

218
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:55,009
This will not be
anything close to easy.

219
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,053
You are not in jail in the present.

220
00:19:57,104 --> 00:20:00,556
Are you not comfortable?
- I'm never comfortable.

221
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:04,521
Some people
were born to compose music.

222
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,732
Others to split the atom.

223
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,985
I was born to steal shit.

224
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:17,081
Hold out your hand.

225
00:20:18,626 --> 00:20:19,741
Hand?

226
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:28,833
That coin was given to me by Victor
when we became partners.

227
00:20:28,887 --> 00:20:31,425
The coin represents
a Russian phrase.

228
00:20:31,473 --> 00:20:36,811
Vorovoslky mir.
Loosely translated, thieves' world.

229
00:20:37,896 --> 00:20:39,307
Victor belonged to it.

230
00:20:39,356 --> 00:20:40,636
Now...

231
00:20:41,691 --> 00:20:43,648
you belong to it.

232
00:21:22,358 --> 00:21:24,646
Psst. Hey!

233
00:21:24,693 --> 00:21:28,442
You misunderstand.
Ripley's just business.

234
00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:30,363
This is...

235
00:21:30,407 --> 00:21:31,866
Stalking?

236
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:36,820
Well, if you had given me your number,
I would have called first.

237
00:21:38,207 --> 00:21:41,208
Those are two very flawed assumptions.

238
00:21:41,252 --> 00:21:42,876
Do you have a vase?

239
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,877
I just took these
from a roadside shrine

240
00:21:44,922 --> 00:21:47,757
and I think they need some water.

241
00:21:49,802 --> 00:21:53,800
May I use that... thing over there?
Yeah, yeah.

242
00:21:54,849 --> 00:22:00,638
I've noticed this Russian nightclub
down the block.

243
00:22:00,688 --> 00:22:02,645
Riga Rose or something like that.

244
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,813
Why don't we meet there after work?

245
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:11,854
I'm busy.

246
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:16,201
I'll wait.
- I won't show.

247
00:22:16,246 --> 00:22:18,119
I'll take my chances.

248
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:24,663
Do svidanja, Alexandra.

249
00:22:25,422 --> 00:22:29,834
Research. Keith Ripley.
'93, the Brooklyn Museum.

250
00:22:29,885 --> 00:22:32,802
'94, the Diamond District Warehouse
and then in '95...

251
00:22:32,846 --> 00:22:36,262
I'm very familiar
with Ripley's life story, Michaels.

252
00:22:36,308 --> 00:22:39,677
In fact, I busted him twice.

253
00:22:39,728 --> 00:22:42,266
Both times he walked
because of good lawyering.

254
00:22:42,314 --> 00:22:45,268
Exactly, so I thought
why not swing for the fences?

255
00:22:45,317 --> 00:22:47,226
Murder one, Victor Korolenko.

256
00:22:47,277 --> 00:22:50,195
Thinkin' of the Brighton Beach steam bath?
Forget it. There was no...

257
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:53,193
No body. But we've got a ton of forensics.
- And no witnesses.

258
00:22:53,242 --> 00:22:56,278
Nobody there admitted
to seeing a thing.

259
00:22:56,328 --> 00:22:59,827
I was this close to convincing
Korolenko to take witness protection,

260
00:22:59,873 --> 00:23:02,162
in exchange for giving up Ripley.

261
00:23:02,209 --> 00:23:04,782
But Ripley got to him first.

262
00:23:04,837 --> 00:23:06,461
I can't prove it.

263
00:23:06,505 --> 00:23:08,747
Right, OK. I see, I see. OK.

264
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,800
No, what you don't see, Michaels,

265
00:23:11,844 --> 00:23:14,798
is why Ripley got involved
in a small-time caper,

266
00:23:14,847 --> 00:23:18,097
like grabbin' a few diamonds
off of some couriers on a subway.

267
00:23:18,142 --> 00:23:19,221
And neither did I.

268
00:23:19,268 --> 00:23:21,640
Until I read
the Dutch guy's statement.

269
00:23:23,731 --> 00:23:25,724
Those diamonds came from Romanov's.

270
00:23:27,193 --> 00:23:30,858
You mean Ripley and his new partner
are planning to take down Romanov's?

271
00:23:32,073 --> 00:23:34,742
Ah, come on!
Like that could ever happen!

272
00:23:34,784 --> 00:23:37,701
Not even Ripley
could take down a place like that.

273
00:23:38,955 --> 00:23:39,986
Wanna bet?

274
00:24:07,776 --> 00:24:09,899
Hi.
- Hi.

275
00:24:09,945 --> 00:24:13,444
You know this place very well.
- I never said I didn't.

276
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,732
Let's face it,
you didn't see the nightclub.

277
00:24:15,784 --> 00:24:19,532
You saw the flyer in the fax
and then you made an assumption.

278
00:24:19,579 --> 00:24:22,783
Yeah. Guilty. So I did.

279
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:26,877
Never assume anything,
especially down here.

280
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,494
How mysterious.
- What?

281
00:24:29,548 --> 00:24:32,253
How mysterious!

282
00:24:32,301 --> 00:24:34,589
Can I buy you a drink?
- I don't drink.

283
00:24:34,636 --> 00:24:36,843
Another assumption.

284
00:24:38,932 --> 00:24:40,724
You wanna dance?

285
00:24:44,021 --> 00:24:45,100
Yeah.

286
00:24:45,856 --> 00:24:49,307
I'm willing to make a fool of myself.
Why not?

287
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:48,041
Here.

288
00:25:49,879 --> 00:25:51,539
And for him.
- Thank you.

289
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:52,834
Thanks.

290
00:25:52,882 --> 00:25:54,590
I thought all Russians drank.

291
00:25:54,634 --> 00:25:57,920
Translation,
we're a race of suicidal alcoholics.

292
00:25:57,971 --> 00:26:00,379
No! I didn't mean that! No.

293
00:26:00,432 --> 00:26:02,887
Actually, we are. Cheers.

294
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,135
Nastaravia.
- Nastarovia.

295
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:07,931
Nastarovia?
- Mmm.

296
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:13,194
So... how is it...
working for the lawyer?

297
00:26:14,237 --> 00:26:17,238
Huh, I'm a lawyer, too, you know.
- Oh.

298
00:26:18,116 --> 00:26:21,817
Maybe I won't say another word
because everything I assume is wrong.

299
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,907
Well, you don't know until you try.
- True.

300
00:26:24,957 --> 00:26:28,041
Besides, my father warned me
about being a lawyer.

301
00:26:28,085 --> 00:26:31,288
He told me I should try and do
something honest with my life.

302
00:26:31,338 --> 00:26:33,710
As if he would know.

303
00:26:33,757 --> 00:26:37,837
Your father and Ripley,
they were close, right?

304
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,598
Once upon a time.

305
00:26:45,728 --> 00:26:48,219
I'm sure Ripley told you.
My father's dead.

306
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:53,355
Now Ripley likes
to try to take care of me.

307
00:26:53,402 --> 00:26:55,691
Pay for stuff. That kind of thing.

308
00:26:56,739 --> 00:26:59,491
Of course, it's the least he can do.

309
00:27:00,326 --> 00:27:03,327
Sorry. I don't mean to pry.

310
00:27:09,168 --> 00:27:10,793
Yes, you do.

311
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,921
Now who is making assumptions?

312
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:21,134
No, Gaby. I'm not assuming a thing.

313
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,280
You wanna know about Ripley?

314
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,404
Stay away.

315
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,952
You son of a bitch!

316
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,324
Well... you dropped these

317
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:33,538
and I am a gentleman
bringing them back to you.

318
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,497
Uh-huh.

319
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:41,629
No, no, no, no, no!

320
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,385
No!

321
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:38,398
Shit, man! What do you want?

322
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:41,779
I told you to leave her alone.

323
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:45,702
I'm not gonna tell you again.

324
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:48,864
Get dressed. I'll be downstairs.

325
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:58,249
Son of a bitch.

326
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:04,334
Fascinating.

327
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:09,219
You could start a whole new trend
in interior design.

328
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:15,136
What are these?
- What do they look like?

329
00:30:15,191 --> 00:30:16,601
Police IDs?

330
00:30:17,318 --> 00:30:20,936
There's a reception at Romanov's
tonight, honouring the NYPD.

331
00:30:22,323 --> 00:30:25,158
And our invitation's just arrived.

332
00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:26,529
A cop for the night.

333
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:29,247
And all the doughnuts you can eat.

334
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:32,289
Meanwhile, however,
I need you to go to the dry-cleaners.

335
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:35,916
Why don't you go and pick up
your dry-cleaning yourself, sir?

336
00:30:35,962 --> 00:30:37,919
Who said anything about picking up?

337
00:30:39,716 --> 00:30:41,044
You're dropping off.

338
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:22,340
Cellphone, please.

339
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,033
Commissioner Rawls.
- Gentlemen.

340
00:31:55,084 --> 00:31:57,076
Deputy Commissioner Morelli.

341
00:31:57,127 --> 00:31:59,037
Such a pleasure having you here.

342
00:31:59,088 --> 00:32:01,661
May we give you gentlemen
the grand tour?

343
00:32:01,715 --> 00:32:03,957
The secrets of Romanov?
- You might say so.

344
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:05,919
Thank you. We're honoured.
- Please.

345
00:32:11,684 --> 00:32:14,389
The guards,
all FSB secret police.

346
00:32:14,437 --> 00:32:17,806
Every door, every inch of glass
wired and alarmed.

347
00:32:17,857 --> 00:32:21,807
So even if a bird flies in here,
you know about it.

348
00:32:22,737 --> 00:32:24,361
Topkapi.

349
00:32:24,405 --> 00:32:25,864
Rififi.

350
00:32:25,907 --> 00:32:29,857
No, the bird flew into the museum,
landed on the wire

351
00:32:29,911 --> 00:32:32,366
and set off the alarm in Topkapi.

352
00:32:32,413 --> 00:32:33,908
You're a cineaste.

353
00:32:33,957 --> 00:32:36,530
Actually, I only see heist movies.

354
00:32:38,336 --> 00:32:41,705
Well, the lesson to take away
from the bird flying into the museum

355
00:32:41,756 --> 00:32:46,465
is no matter how well you planned,
always be ready to improvise

356
00:32:46,511 --> 00:32:49,595
because, I guarantee you,
something's gonna go wrong.

357
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:52,391
I'd prefer to avoid that.
- Uh-huh.

358
00:32:52,434 --> 00:32:56,016
How comprehensive
is the surveillance system?

359
00:32:56,062 --> 00:32:57,438
Let's take a look.

360
00:33:18,835 --> 00:33:21,373
Smart card for the elevator.
- And all the doors.

361
00:33:21,421 --> 00:33:23,165
This way. After you.

362
00:33:23,632 --> 00:33:24,663
We're on.

363
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,258
Good to see you, old friend.
Let me introduce you.

364
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:35,009
Lieutenant Weber, I presume.

365
00:33:35,936 --> 00:33:39,601
You know, Ripley,
identity theft is a serious crime.

366
00:33:39,648 --> 00:33:42,566
And quite an embarrassing one in this case.
- Really?

367
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,401
Do you realise how ashamed I felt

368
00:33:44,445 --> 00:33:48,028
telling that nice lady at the door
that I was still a lieutenant?

369
00:33:48,074 --> 00:33:50,066
I mean at my age?

370
00:33:50,117 --> 00:33:51,825
Or should I say at your age?

371
00:33:51,869 --> 00:33:55,119
I'm not amused.
What are you doing here?

372
00:33:55,164 --> 00:33:58,615
And why did you appropriate my
invitation? As if I didn't know.

373
00:33:58,668 --> 00:34:00,826
I apologise for the subterfuge.

374
00:34:00,878 --> 00:34:04,746
I just wanted to show my friend here
some of the finer things in life.

375
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,879
If you want to arrest us for impersonating
police officers, go right ahead.

376
00:34:08,928 --> 00:34:11,336
I'm sure my lawyer
will have us out in two hours.

377
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:14,675
It'd be a delightful two hours.
Get your hands down!

378
00:34:14,726 --> 00:34:18,308
Then there's all that explaining
you'd have to do to your superiors.

379
00:34:18,354 --> 00:34:20,347
Now that would be an embarrassment.

380
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:25,309
Notorious thief gaining admittance
pretending to be you.

381
00:34:25,361 --> 00:34:26,737
Great police work, Weber.

382
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,567
We should discuss my police work
when this is all over.

383
00:34:29,616 --> 00:34:31,027
Hmm.

384
00:34:31,076 --> 00:34:34,658
Who's your sidekick?
- Jules Dassin.

385
00:34:34,704 --> 00:34:39,247
Good to meet you, Jules.
I love your movies.

386
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:41,285
Enjoy the party, gents.

387
00:34:41,336 --> 00:34:43,412
While it lasts.

388
00:34:45,674 --> 00:34:50,170
Now... do you mind telling me
what that was all about?

389
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:53,719
Just a cop.
- Really? No kidding.

390
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:59,099
We have been made in the very place
we are supposed to take down.

391
00:34:59,146 --> 00:35:01,601
Exactly how do you stay out of jail?

392
00:35:01,648 --> 00:35:06,856
Unless, of course, you and this Weber
are partners trying to set me up.

393
00:35:08,322 --> 00:35:09,982
Are you, Ripley?

394
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,155
Here we go.

395
00:35:14,203 --> 00:35:15,911
Come on! Move your damn ass!

396
00:35:20,376 --> 00:35:22,783
Weber has no idea
what we're here for.

397
00:35:22,836 --> 00:35:24,331
Of course he does.

398
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,538
He doesn't know when
and he doesn't know how.

399
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,464
And, no, he doesn't know
about the eggs.

400
00:35:28,509 --> 00:35:30,169
No one does. Here.

401
00:35:30,219 --> 00:35:31,797
The best way to neutralise Weber

402
00:35:31,846 --> 00:35:34,384
is to fuel his obsession
with busting me.

403
00:35:35,141 --> 00:35:39,008
He's so blinded by it, he no longer
thinks like a cop. Trust me.

404
00:35:39,061 --> 00:35:41,387
Give me a good reason to, huh?

405
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:44,440
I already gave you
40 million good reasons. Here.

406
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,193
Now you've seen what the public sees,
it's time for the real treat.

407
00:35:49,238 --> 00:35:53,106
That is, of course, as long as you
promise not to come back and rob us.

408
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:55,152
I guess I won't take any notes, then.

409
00:35:58,706 --> 00:36:00,615
Our main vault.

410
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:02,825
Gregor,
disarm the motion detectors.

411
00:36:02,877 --> 00:36:05,368
Even with the knowledge
of all protocols,

412
00:36:05,421 --> 00:36:07,912
it is absolutely impregnable.

413
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:11,085
The voice sensors ask
our head of security, Boris Sergeev,

414
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,259
a random set of pre-recorded words.

415
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:16,341
But this is only half the process.

416
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:20,638
We also have
a biometric handprint sensor.

417
00:36:20,687 --> 00:36:24,138
Since Mr Sergeev and I
are the only ones who have clearance,

418
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,516
we must both be present
to open the vaults.

419
00:36:26,568 --> 00:36:29,688
Once I activate
the biometric handprint sensor,

420
00:36:29,738 --> 00:36:32,110
he must activate the voice sensor.

421
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:35,074
This way neither of us
can steal from the other.

422
00:36:35,118 --> 00:36:37,740
Well, you better hope Mr Sergeev
stays healthy.

423
00:36:39,915 --> 00:36:41,954
I must stay healthy as well!

424
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:54,043
 Hamburger.
- Hamburger.

425
00:36:55,723 --> 00:36:58,178
Big Apple.
- Big Apple.

426
00:37:05,316 --> 00:37:07,142
Jesus Christ.

427
00:37:07,193 --> 00:37:10,727
 The vault door
automatically resets on the hour,

428
00:37:10,779 --> 00:37:13,946
at which point the sensor
must be activated in reverse.

429
00:37:13,991 --> 00:37:17,075
All in all, gentlemen,
best not to get locked inside.

430
00:37:18,412 --> 00:37:20,369
Well, did I say it was gonna be easy?

431
00:37:20,414 --> 00:37:24,163
No, but you didn't say
it would be impossible either.

432
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,870
 Armoured glass.

433
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,956
It would take half an hour
to break through just one case.

434
00:37:30,675 --> 00:37:34,174
But, I'm afraid, whoever tried
wouldn't even have half a second

435
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,755
because an ultrasonic motion detector
would automatically lock him in

436
00:37:37,807 --> 00:37:39,716
and trigger the alarm.

437
00:37:39,767 --> 00:37:43,350
Containment security, gentlemen.
Getting in is highly improbable.

438
00:37:43,396 --> 00:37:45,768
But getting out is,
frankly, impossible.

439
00:37:45,815 --> 00:37:47,642
Where does that door lead?

440
00:37:47,692 --> 00:37:51,143
 To our inner vault, which
contains our most precious items.

441
00:37:51,196 --> 00:37:53,022
I'm sorry but security prevents me

442
00:37:53,072 --> 00:37:55,908
from taking even this
distinguished group in there.

443
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,441
Now we'll proceed back
to the reception.

444
00:37:58,495 --> 00:38:00,534
I'd like to, once again,
thank you both

445
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,783
for your generosity this last year
in helping set up our business.

446
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:06,371
And thank you very much
for the donation of that chopper.

447
00:38:06,419 --> 00:38:07,795
 You're welcome.

448
00:38:07,837 --> 00:38:11,004
Let's go. We can do this, Gabriel.

449
00:38:11,049 --> 00:38:13,207
No. Absolutely not!

450
00:38:14,678 --> 00:38:17,963
It was a pleasure. Goodbye.
- Wait a minute. Wait.

451
00:38:19,474 --> 00:38:21,266
Nobody's going anywhere yet.

452
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:24,061
If Zykov finds that camera,
he's gonna know what it is.

453
00:38:24,104 --> 00:38:26,310
They'll change all the protocols.

454
00:38:26,356 --> 00:38:30,306
Which part of "I don't give a shit"
do you not understand?

455
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:51,460
Sorry. Let me just...

456
00:38:51,507 --> 00:38:53,546
I'll handle it.
- No, no, no.

457
00:38:53,592 --> 00:38:56,677
Please, please. Allow me.
- I'm absolutely OK.

458
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,179
I apologise, sir.

459
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:38,710
What the fuck?

460
00:39:39,889 --> 00:39:41,134
What the fuck?

461
00:39:41,182 --> 00:39:44,634
Detective Weber, I'm Hal Donley,
special agent in charge of this op.

462
00:39:44,686 --> 00:39:47,603
You're conducting
an investigation of a potential theft

463
00:39:47,647 --> 00:39:50,185
that you assume is going down
at Romanov Jewellers.

464
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:52,226
Assume, my ass.

465
00:39:52,277 --> 00:39:55,313
I know it's going down
and I know who's pulling it off.

466
00:39:55,363 --> 00:39:58,068
Except we're asking you
to call off your dogs.

467
00:39:58,116 --> 00:40:00,239
There are other matters
that take precedence.

468
00:40:00,285 --> 00:40:02,076
What could possibly take precedence

469
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,825
over the potential theft
of millions of dollars in diamonds

470
00:40:04,873 --> 00:40:09,037
from a company that donates tons of money
and equipment to the NYPD?

471
00:40:10,963 --> 00:40:12,706
Valentin?

472
00:40:12,756 --> 00:40:14,547
Vitaly Zykov, in the old Soviet days,

473
00:40:14,591 --> 00:40:18,375
was the right-hand man
to a party boss named Dimitri Kuzin.

474
00:40:19,555 --> 00:40:23,766
Kuzin set up a supposedly independent
Russian diamond centre in America.

475
00:40:25,227 --> 00:40:26,258
Romanov's.

476
00:40:27,479 --> 00:40:31,691
But diamonds... they're not all
that he's shipping over here.

477
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:33,857
He's ripping off
the Russian Treasury.

478
00:40:33,903 --> 00:40:36,061
Gold, gems, artworks.

479
00:40:37,114 --> 00:40:39,071
Where do you think
Romanov's got the money

480
00:40:39,116 --> 00:40:42,817
to buy your department a helicopter
and now police cars?

481
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,661
From retail diamond sales?

482
00:40:44,705 --> 00:40:47,872
So why are they doing this?
- Is that a serious question?

483
00:40:49,627 --> 00:40:52,082
So the NYPD will leave them alone.

484
00:40:52,129 --> 00:40:54,537
That's their mindset.

485
00:40:57,468 --> 00:40:59,840
We need more time
to build our mutual cases.

486
00:40:59,887 --> 00:41:02,425
That's why we can't have
any other investigations

487
00:41:02,473 --> 00:41:04,632
potentially alerting Zykov.

488
00:41:09,272 --> 00:41:11,063
Lieutenant...

489
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,431
shut it down.

490
00:41:15,987 --> 00:41:18,608
Gentlemen.
- Commissioner...

491
00:41:20,825 --> 00:41:23,862
Just in case
you think you're smarter than us,

492
00:41:23,912 --> 00:41:27,078
decide to continue this investigation
on a down and low,

493
00:41:27,123 --> 00:41:28,321
forget it.

494
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:32,242
This is bigger than you and your ego.
Do you get it?

495
00:41:33,713 --> 00:41:35,089
I get it.

496
00:41:38,468 --> 00:41:42,383
What did the feds have to say?
- Nothing. Everything's still a go.

497
00:41:44,266 --> 00:41:48,098
The first order of business
is to bypass the security cameras.

498
00:41:48,145 --> 00:41:51,015
If we can gain access
into the surveillance system,

499
00:41:51,064 --> 00:41:55,477
we can replace the light feed
with a continuous loop of study shots

500
00:41:55,527 --> 00:41:57,603
with no face inside.

501
00:41:57,654 --> 00:41:59,647
That still leaves the voice sensors,

502
00:41:59,698 --> 00:42:02,699
the fingerprints,
the motion detectors,

503
00:42:02,743 --> 00:42:05,993
the meanest-looking vault door
I have ever seen in my life.

504
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:31,390
The inner vault door,
Swiss-made, 3 feet thick,

505
00:42:31,439 --> 00:42:33,727
with spring-driven relocking bolts.

506
00:42:34,066 --> 00:42:36,355
If you punch out the lock,
they block retraction

507
00:42:36,402 --> 00:42:39,189
so that you couldn't open it
even if you knew the combination.

508
00:42:39,238 --> 00:42:41,812
 Abraham Lincoln.

509
00:42:41,866 --> 00:42:44,701
 Broadway.
- Broadway.

510
00:42:44,744 --> 00:42:48,077
30 pre-recorded words.
One week, we've got them all.

511
00:42:48,122 --> 00:42:49,367
Dan McWilliams, MTA.

512
00:42:49,415 --> 00:42:52,120
Yes, we're going to be doing
some maintenance work

513
00:42:52,168 --> 00:42:54,837
in the subway adjacent
to your basement next week.

514
00:42:54,879 --> 00:42:58,829
We'll be working nights and didn't
want the drilling to alarm you.

515
00:43:19,529 --> 00:43:22,483
You place
an ultrasonic transducer here,

516
00:43:22,532 --> 00:43:26,233
broadcasting at the exact operating
frequency of the transmitter

517
00:43:26,286 --> 00:43:29,240
and it bounces back
the frequency to the unit.

518
00:43:29,289 --> 00:43:31,080
At least in theory.

519
00:43:31,124 --> 00:43:33,911
Have you ever used
an ultrasonic transducer?

520
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,241
Nope.

521
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,833
Can you get an ultrasonic transducer?

522
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:39,506
I can get anything, my friend.

523
00:43:39,549 --> 00:43:43,879
Can you get past a keypad?
- It is, as always, a question of time.

524
00:43:43,929 --> 00:43:45,756
One tumbler at a time.

525
00:43:45,806 --> 00:43:49,886
It is tight but possible.

526
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:08,157
You.

527
00:44:09,538 --> 00:44:11,198
Yeah.

528
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:12,529
Me.

529
00:44:21,342 --> 00:44:23,002
What's so funny?

530
00:44:24,053 --> 00:44:26,544
I hate Chinese food.

531
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:30,216
I absolutely, unequivocally,

532
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:32,344
irrevocably,

533
00:44:32,395 --> 00:44:35,230
loathe Chinese food.

534
00:44:36,065 --> 00:44:37,096
Oh!

535
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:41,230
Leonid, my boss,
is addicted to Chinese food.

536
00:44:42,905 --> 00:44:44,613
I can't even stand the smell.

537
00:44:44,657 --> 00:44:47,824
Another completely wrong assumption.

538
00:44:47,869 --> 00:44:49,280
No.

539
00:44:50,455 --> 00:44:52,578
It's not completely...

540
00:44:52,624 --> 00:44:53,703
wrong.

541
00:44:59,464 --> 00:45:00,495
What?

542
00:45:08,598 --> 00:45:09,713
Wow!

543
00:45:15,564 --> 00:45:18,600
You stole this.
- Yes, I did.

544
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:21,817
Didn't you?
- Yes. That's what I do.

545
00:46:06,782 --> 00:46:08,193
Wait.

546
00:46:40,942 --> 00:46:43,018
We have a problem.

547
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:46,106
The bracelet?

548
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:48,771
I cannot return it.

549
00:46:51,036 --> 00:46:53,527
No, I like it.

550
00:46:54,873 --> 00:46:57,494
So what could possibly be a problem?

551
00:46:57,542 --> 00:47:00,080
You.

552
00:47:00,921 --> 00:47:02,664
What?
- Me.

553
00:47:02,714 --> 00:47:05,419
I thought that part
was not a problem.

554
00:47:05,467 --> 00:47:08,421
And Ripley.

555
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:09,964
That part is a problem.

556
00:47:11,056 --> 00:47:14,507
Yours and Ripley's
is a world I just can't trust.

557
00:47:18,522 --> 00:47:20,313
How did your father die?

558
00:47:22,317 --> 00:47:24,524
By gunshot.

559
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:26,693
Who did it?

560
00:47:26,739 --> 00:47:31,199
He had gambling debts to a Russian
gangster named Nicky Petrovich.

561
00:47:33,162 --> 00:47:35,154
Nicky wants his money.
- Ask him.

562
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,124
This concept of vorovosky...

563
00:47:39,168 --> 00:47:41,955
Vorovosky mir.
Yes, I'm familiar with it.

564
00:47:42,004 --> 00:47:45,587
Where one is responsible
for the debts of another one.

565
00:47:45,633 --> 00:47:49,132
Why would they kill your father
and let Ripley live?

566
00:47:50,429 --> 00:47:54,297
Because Ripley has... I don't know.
How do you want me to put this?

567
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:55,429
Earning power.

568
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,308
Gaby...

569
00:48:01,524 --> 00:48:04,145
I don't wanna go to any more funerals.

570
00:48:08,865 --> 00:48:12,732
I wanna be with you
but I can't promise you that,

571
00:48:12,785 --> 00:48:16,949
and you can't promise me a thing so...

572
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,742
maybe we shouldn't even try.

573
00:48:28,551 --> 00:48:31,552
Oh, you, you, you, you.

574
00:48:35,267 --> 00:48:36,595
Get in.

575
00:48:46,695 --> 00:48:50,360
I know you don't want to, I know you
don't mean to, but you will hurt her.

576
00:48:50,407 --> 00:48:52,281
She doesn't need any more of that.

577
00:48:53,702 --> 00:48:57,949
None of which you had
anything to do with. Am I right?

578
00:48:59,082 --> 00:49:01,371
Is there something
you want to ask me?

579
00:49:03,128 --> 00:49:04,706
Yes.

580
00:49:05,506 --> 00:49:09,171
Why is Victor dead
and you're still walking round?

581
00:49:11,971 --> 00:49:16,051
I'm sure Alex told you that Victor was
in deep to a man named Nicky Petrovich.

582
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,970
What she didn't know was
Nicky was ready to forgive the debt,

583
00:49:19,019 --> 00:49:21,890
if Victor pulled a job, this job.

584
00:49:21,939 --> 00:49:24,311
Victor backed out?
- He was trying to protect Alex.

585
00:49:24,358 --> 00:49:28,522
Made a deal with Weber.
He was gonna drop the dime on Nicky.

586
00:49:28,571 --> 00:49:30,860
And you.
- And me.

587
00:49:30,906 --> 00:49:33,444
Weber offered Victor witness protection.

588
00:49:33,492 --> 00:49:35,615
He and Alex,
but Alex didn't want to go.

589
00:49:35,661 --> 00:49:38,911
Victor didn't want to
go without her so...

590
00:49:38,956 --> 00:49:40,866
he bought a bullet instead.

591
00:49:40,917 --> 00:49:45,045
So why is this still your problem?
Why don't you just leave?

592
00:49:45,088 --> 00:49:49,584
You don't make a deal with Nicky
for the throw of it and then walk away.

593
00:49:49,634 --> 00:49:53,632
There's no statute of limitations.
Nicky wants those eggs.

594
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,637
Victor's share would
have paid off his debt.

595
00:49:57,684 --> 00:50:00,887
Victor and I were partners.
He was responsible for me.

596
00:50:00,937 --> 00:50:04,555
So now I'm responsible for him
and his debt.

597
00:50:05,733 --> 00:50:06,765
Bullshit.

598
00:50:06,818 --> 00:50:09,985
Victor is dead. Just walk away.

599
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:12,947
That's not an option.
- Oh, wow! This is just...

600
00:50:14,409 --> 00:50:15,951
Look...

601
00:50:16,995 --> 00:50:18,158
We do the job.

602
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,998
Nicky gets his cut,
I take a small chunk,

603
00:50:22,042 --> 00:50:25,208
nowhere near commensurate
with my risk,

604
00:50:25,253 --> 00:50:26,997
and you clear a cool 20 million.

605
00:50:27,047 --> 00:50:29,917
I don't know. This is just...

606
00:50:29,966 --> 00:50:33,335
Look, either we pull
this job off flawlessly

607
00:50:33,387 --> 00:50:36,506
or you call Weber
and you ask for witness protection,

608
00:50:36,556 --> 00:50:38,134
which isn't a choice at all

609
00:50:38,183 --> 00:50:40,555
because Nicky will find you
and he will kill you.

610
00:50:40,602 --> 00:50:43,556
It doesn't matter where you go
or how long it takes.

611
00:50:44,523 --> 00:50:46,101
That's an unalterable fact.

612
00:50:55,367 --> 00:50:56,861
Well...

613
00:51:01,665 --> 00:51:04,915
Then we steal the fucking eggs, no?

614
00:51:06,212 --> 00:51:07,291
Yes.

615
00:51:11,008 --> 00:51:12,586
Oh, shit!

616
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:18,962
All right, we are working on it.
So back off, please. Thank you.

617
00:51:19,016 --> 00:51:21,305
I think he called us a name.

618
00:51:23,646 --> 00:51:25,686
We do not like to be insulted.

619
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,145
All right!

620
00:52:48,566 --> 00:52:50,689
Do you know
the significance of this coin?

621
00:52:53,112 --> 00:52:54,191
Yeah.

622
00:52:56,449 --> 00:53:00,696
Then you must know by the mere fact
that you have it in your possession,

623
00:53:00,745 --> 00:53:05,572
I cannot assume the two of you
will not attempt to double-cross me.

624
00:53:05,625 --> 00:53:09,705
Nobody's gonna try to double-cross you, Nicky.
We've been trying to...

625
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,499
Nicky...

626
00:53:15,927 --> 00:53:19,510
Alex... I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, well, we're all sorry, aren't we?

627
00:53:20,932 --> 00:53:23,423
There's no reason
for you to bring her here.

628
00:53:23,476 --> 00:53:26,927
The fact that you gave
that coin to him

629
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,684
tells me there are many reasons,

630
00:53:29,732 --> 00:53:32,188
but only one I care about.

631
00:53:32,235 --> 00:53:34,109
Why would we try to betray you?

632
00:53:34,154 --> 00:53:38,198
Well, Ripley, in your case, perhaps,

633
00:53:38,241 --> 00:53:39,984
a misguided sense of revenge.

634
00:53:40,035 --> 00:53:43,201
His, perhaps, simply greed.

635
00:53:43,246 --> 00:53:45,868
It doesn't matter.

636
00:53:45,916 --> 00:53:48,407
I will not take the chance
of the two of you

637
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:52,789
taking what is rightfully mine
and selling it to the highest bidder.

638
00:53:54,841 --> 00:53:58,376
Please, excuse me, Mr Petrovich...

639
00:53:58,428 --> 00:54:00,635
Will you please? Thank you.

640
00:54:00,681 --> 00:54:05,259
Where is it written
that these eggs are yours?

641
00:54:08,647 --> 00:54:10,521
Because they belong to my family.

642
00:54:11,859 --> 00:54:16,853
Because my great-grandfather
made them.

643
00:54:17,698 --> 00:54:20,782
Yes, Ripley.
Evgenly Petrovich made them.

644
00:54:24,747 --> 00:54:29,989
He made the 1917 mystery eggs.

645
00:54:30,669 --> 00:54:33,042
I will have those eggs.

646
00:54:33,088 --> 00:54:36,504
And you will get them for me.

647
00:54:37,593 --> 00:54:41,591
That's why I bring Alexandra here.

648
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:44,972
To keep me company while you do
what you need to do.

649
00:54:47,353 --> 00:54:48,432
Go.

650
00:54:54,026 --> 00:54:57,609
Anyone tries to follow us, she dies.

651
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:00,817
You'd better believe she dies.

652
00:55:02,869 --> 00:55:05,157
If I don't get what I want...

653
00:55:06,205 --> 00:55:07,237
she dies.

654
00:55:09,751 --> 00:55:11,031
Go.

655
00:55:11,085 --> 00:55:13,244
There is a subway not far.

656
00:55:17,467 --> 00:55:19,210
Damn you, Gabriel!

657
00:55:19,928 --> 00:55:22,086
I told you not to get her involved!

658
00:55:22,138 --> 00:55:24,214
You told me? You told me?

659
00:55:24,265 --> 00:55:27,551
You and her father got her involved
even before she was born!

660
00:55:27,602 --> 00:55:30,224
Goddamn it! We go tomorrow.

661
00:57:44,366 --> 00:57:45,397
How much time?

662
00:57:46,535 --> 00:57:48,860
Just over three minutes
until the 22:00 check.

663
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:16,645
Smart card. Come on! Come on!

664
01:00:21,234 --> 01:00:22,265
Let's go.

665
01:02:48,342 --> 01:02:49,836
 Rasputin.

666
01:02:53,138 --> 01:02:55,047
 Rasputin.

667
01:02:55,098 --> 01:02:56,676
 Seventeen.

668
01:02:58,685 --> 01:03:00,144
Seventeen.

669
01:03:00,187 --> 01:03:03,852
 Norway.
- Norway.

670
01:03:05,275 --> 01:03:07,767
 Tyi golodny?

671
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:11,774
Tyi golodny?

672
01:03:11,824 --> 01:03:13,733
Fuck.

673
01:03:13,784 --> 01:03:17,118
It wants to know if I'm hungry.
- Are you?

674
01:03:19,165 --> 01:03:20,196
Tyi golodny?

675
01:03:22,543 --> 01:03:24,536
Tyi golodny?

676
01:03:26,088 --> 01:03:27,120
Nyet.

677
01:04:17,432 --> 01:04:19,674
All right.
- Wait, wait, wait.

678
01:04:28,652 --> 01:04:29,814
Go.

679
01:04:35,742 --> 01:04:38,862
Stop. Go right.

680
01:04:41,665 --> 01:04:44,536
Right. Right.

681
01:04:45,419 --> 01:04:46,534
Stop.

682
01:04:47,713 --> 01:04:49,587
Good. Straight ahead.

683
01:04:55,179 --> 01:04:57,255
Go, go, go, go, go.

684
01:04:58,224 --> 01:05:00,679
Stop. Flatten out.
Head down, head down, head down!

685
01:05:03,062 --> 01:05:06,727
OK, now diagonally left.

686
01:05:07,608 --> 01:05:09,067
Diagonally to the left.

687
01:05:14,699 --> 01:05:17,106
Keep going. Left.

688
01:05:17,159 --> 01:05:19,033
Get your arm in. No arms!

689
01:05:19,078 --> 01:05:22,032
Flat. Down.
- Holy shit!

690
01:05:22,081 --> 01:05:24,655
OK, straight ahead.

691
01:05:30,089 --> 01:05:31,916
Go, go, go, go, go!

692
01:05:31,966 --> 01:05:33,674
Go, go!

693
01:05:38,514 --> 01:05:39,546
Stop! Stop!

694
01:05:41,351 --> 01:05:42,893
Deploy.

695
01:05:51,736 --> 01:05:53,195
Hurry.

696
01:06:06,543 --> 01:06:08,203
Stop! Stop! Flat! Flat!

697
01:06:11,423 --> 01:06:12,703
OK, hurry.

698
01:06:21,558 --> 01:06:22,589
Quick as you can.

699
01:06:27,106 --> 01:06:28,304
Good.

700
01:06:36,031 --> 01:06:37,525
It's working. Let's go!

701
01:07:02,391 --> 01:07:04,717
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

702
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:11,015
Lead.
- OK. Let's take a look.

703
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:29,580
When? Shit!

704
01:07:29,627 --> 01:07:31,953
All right, sit tight.
We're on our way.

705
01:07:32,005 --> 01:07:33,665
Yes, I owe you.

706
01:07:34,632 --> 01:07:36,755
They're havin' a sale at Romanov.

707
01:07:36,801 --> 01:07:37,833
Sir?

708
01:07:37,886 --> 01:07:41,670
That was my plant. Unexplained alarm
went off about an hour ago.

709
01:07:41,723 --> 01:07:43,799
I want all available units
in the garage now.

710
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:46,685
Vouti and Michaels, have them
meet us at the staging area.

711
01:07:46,728 --> 01:07:48,768
Yes, sir.
- Now it's my turn.

712
01:07:59,116 --> 01:08:01,025
We're good.

713
01:08:05,455 --> 01:08:06,535
All right.

714
01:08:12,045 --> 01:08:13,670
Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

715
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:16,208
You're on.
- All right.

716
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,884
A little more.
- Ready?

717
01:08:18,927 --> 01:08:20,801
Come on, a little more.

718
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:22,340
Come on. More, more, more.

719
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:26,257
More, more, more.
Stop! OK. Right there.

720
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,979
All right.
- OK.

721
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:34,191
One.

722
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:35,314
No.

723
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,822
Two.

724
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:41,650
No. Three.

725
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:44,362
No. Four.

726
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:49,873
Whoa! That's it!

727
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:50,949
Four, one.

728
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:54,544
No. Four, two.

729
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,917
No. Four, three.

730
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:01,427
No. Four, four.

731
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:05,552
No. Four, five.

732
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,096
Bingo!

733
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:14,314
Go, go, go! Let's go!
- Yes, sir.

734
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:16,517
Sometime tonight. How about it?

735
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,479
All right.
- All right.

736
01:09:19,406 --> 01:09:22,075
Four, five, six, one, two.

737
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:25,490
Got it. Got it.

738
01:09:25,537 --> 01:09:29,831
Four, five, six, one, two, three.

739
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,668
No.

740
01:09:33,712 --> 01:09:38,125
Four, five, six, one, two, four.

741
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:42,260
No. Four, five, six, one,
two, six, one.

742
01:09:42,304 --> 01:09:43,335
I know.

743
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:46,923
Two, five... No.

744
01:09:46,975 --> 01:09:48,173
Damn it.

745
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:54,179
Four, five, six, one, two, six.

746
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:56,853
Bingo!
- OK.

747
01:09:56,902 --> 01:09:57,933
OK.

748
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:04,610
Four, five, six, one,

749
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:07,910
two, six, one.

750
01:10:11,917 --> 01:10:15,369
One. Come on.

751
01:10:16,672 --> 01:10:20,171
Come on.
What the fuck are you doing?

752
01:10:21,177 --> 01:10:23,300
Improvising.

753
01:10:37,777 --> 01:10:42,154
Shit! Take this shit off.
- Careful.

754
01:10:42,198 --> 01:10:44,487
Come on. Move around this guy.

755
01:10:44,534 --> 01:10:47,867
Move those guys out of the way.
Come on! Go through the lights!

756
01:11:46,388 --> 01:11:48,013
There.

757
01:11:49,516 --> 01:11:50,548
Hmm.

758
01:11:50,601 --> 01:11:52,926
Let's see if we can blow these boxes.

759
01:11:57,024 --> 01:11:58,055
All right.

760
01:12:24,969 --> 01:12:26,000
OK.

761
01:12:50,912 --> 01:12:52,786
What are you doing?
- Give me the box.

762
01:12:54,374 --> 01:12:56,367
Gabriel, don't do this.
- Give me the box.

763
01:12:58,003 --> 01:13:01,087
What, you want more money?
Hell, look around you. Take what you want.

764
01:13:01,131 --> 01:13:03,669
Oh, shut up and give me the box.

765
01:13:05,135 --> 01:13:07,804
What about Alex?
Nicky will kill her. You know that.

766
01:13:07,846 --> 01:13:09,554
I will ask you one more time.

767
01:13:11,725 --> 01:13:14,845
Why are you doing this?

768
01:13:14,895 --> 01:13:16,010
I'm a cop.

769
01:13:18,357 --> 01:13:20,184
In Miami for the last ten years.

770
01:13:20,234 --> 01:13:22,985
Weber requested me. Just for you.

771
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:30,240
So you're a cop.
You wanna arrest me? Go ahead.

772
01:13:30,285 --> 01:13:32,112
Where am I gonna go?

773
01:13:32,162 --> 01:13:36,077
But in one minute that vault door's
gonna lock and we'll be stuck in here

774
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:38,117
and Alex is gonna be dead.

775
01:13:38,168 --> 01:13:40,920
I can't believe you're such
a contemptible human being

776
01:13:40,963 --> 01:13:43,668
that you would use her like that
and then just kill her

777
01:13:43,716 --> 01:13:46,207
cos you might as well
be pulling the trigger yourself.

778
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:49,012
Simply to bag the great Keith Ripley.

779
01:13:50,473 --> 01:13:53,011
You sorry, sick motherfucker.

780
01:13:56,938 --> 01:13:58,136
You got 30 seconds.

781
01:13:58,189 --> 01:13:59,469
How do I find Nicky?

782
01:14:01,067 --> 01:14:02,894
Phone number in my pocket.

783
01:14:02,944 --> 01:14:04,936
Give it to me and the eggs.

784
01:14:06,614 --> 01:14:09,319
Do you want her alive or not?
- Do you?

785
01:14:23,131 --> 01:14:24,162
Ten seconds.

786
01:14:26,509 --> 01:14:27,541
I'm sorry.

787
01:14:57,165 --> 01:14:58,410
Underground, boys.

788
01:14:58,458 --> 01:15:00,416
All right, let's move! Come on!

789
01:15:48,676 --> 01:15:51,677
I'm a police officer! Listen to me!

790
01:15:51,721 --> 01:15:53,713
There is a thief
locked in your inner vault!

791
01:15:53,765 --> 01:15:56,090
The guard is in the basement closet!

792
01:15:56,142 --> 01:15:59,725
Move, move, move, move, move!

793
01:16:00,396 --> 01:16:02,934
Now! Move! Come on!

794
01:16:02,982 --> 01:16:05,189
Tell them to put
their weapons down now!

795
01:16:07,195 --> 01:16:08,274
Now!

796
01:16:09,072 --> 01:16:10,946
OK. Fine.

797
01:16:13,993 --> 01:16:15,322
Put them down!

798
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:16,568
Now!

799
01:16:21,918 --> 01:16:23,875
Kick them. Now!

800
01:16:27,132 --> 01:16:29,041
What do you want?

801
01:16:29,092 --> 01:16:32,342
You let me out the front door
so I can rejoin my unit.

802
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:34,427
They have the building surrounded.

803
01:16:34,473 --> 01:16:38,091
Meantime, you go downstairs,
you find your thief and your comrade.

804
01:16:38,143 --> 01:16:40,812
You understand?
- That door is alarmed.

805
01:16:40,854 --> 01:16:42,432
You have a problem, solve it!

806
01:16:42,481 --> 01:16:44,853
Do not make me
shoot this man, please!

807
01:17:24,065 --> 01:17:26,437
Put down your weapons.
- We are police!

808
01:17:26,484 --> 01:17:29,853
Yeah? Everybody's police tonight.

809
01:17:36,661 --> 01:17:37,692
 Hello?

810
01:17:37,745 --> 01:17:40,830
Hey, I have what you want.
No, it's just me.

811
01:18:02,771 --> 01:18:06,603
Can we talk?
I have a proposition for you.

812
01:18:17,869 --> 01:18:18,901
Where is she?

813
01:18:23,834 --> 01:18:28,377
Do not move.
He has a gun behind the box.

814
01:18:28,422 --> 01:18:29,536
Bad boy.

815
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:32,793
Give me the box
and give Andrei your weapon, please.

816
01:18:32,843 --> 01:18:34,337
We don't wish trouble here.

817
01:18:34,386 --> 01:18:36,213
No, no, no. You don't understand.

818
01:18:36,263 --> 01:18:38,836
You let her go,
then I'll give you the box.

819
01:18:38,891 --> 01:18:42,805
You see, if I fire through this box,

820
01:18:42,853 --> 01:18:45,344
which I have no problem
doing whatsoever,

821
01:18:45,397 --> 01:18:47,105
Nicky's not gonna be very happy.

822
01:18:47,149 --> 01:18:48,857
Then we are all expendable.

823
01:18:50,236 --> 01:18:52,312
If you understand
the meaning of the word.

824
01:18:52,363 --> 01:18:53,738
Open the box.

825
01:18:55,491 --> 01:18:57,614
Lower the gun. Lower the gun.

826
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:59,652
Lower it.

827
01:19:04,667 --> 01:19:05,746
OK.

828
01:19:13,759 --> 01:19:17,211
Are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm just lovely. Thanks.

829
01:19:17,263 --> 01:19:19,588
You go.

830
01:19:27,732 --> 01:19:28,811
Give me the box.

831
01:19:32,487 --> 01:19:34,396
Get in.
- Why?

832
01:19:34,447 --> 01:19:36,025
Nicky wants to see you.

833
01:19:38,451 --> 01:19:39,696
Give me your weapon.

834
01:19:41,246 --> 01:19:42,788
We're fine, right?

835
01:19:52,132 --> 01:19:54,967
Where do you get off detaining us?

836
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:56,801
My apologies, Lieutenant Weber.

837
01:19:56,845 --> 01:19:59,632
My security were,
understandably, confused.

838
01:19:59,681 --> 01:20:02,433
Please go with Mr Sergeev
down to the vault.

839
01:20:02,476 --> 01:20:04,634
We have what you want. Please.

840
01:20:14,655 --> 01:20:18,699
Where's the other one?
- Nobody else. Just him.

841
01:20:18,742 --> 01:20:20,486
Where the hell's my man?

842
01:20:21,829 --> 01:20:26,954
Lieutenant, your personal life,
none of my business.

843
01:20:28,419 --> 01:20:31,289
I apologise for bringing you here...

844
01:20:32,506 --> 01:20:36,967
but I had to be sure the eggs
were genuine before I let you go.

845
01:20:37,011 --> 01:20:41,423
Your lack of trust
is really depressing, Mr Petrovich.

846
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:45,308
I'm a man of my word.

847
01:20:47,271 --> 01:20:49,560
She should be with her godfather now.

848
01:20:52,652 --> 01:20:53,897
Let's see.

849
01:20:55,238 --> 01:20:57,111
Do you mind?
- Sure. Go.

850
01:21:05,289 --> 01:21:06,321
Yeah.

851
01:21:11,504 --> 01:21:14,173
Hello?
- Hey. Where are you?

852
01:21:15,550 --> 01:21:18,219
I'm at the jail. I had to see him.

853
01:21:18,261 --> 01:21:19,589
How is he?

854
01:21:19,637 --> 01:21:21,262
Well, how do you think he is?

855
01:21:21,306 --> 01:21:24,011
I had no choice, Alex.

856
01:21:24,058 --> 01:21:25,339
No one had a choice.

857
01:21:25,393 --> 01:21:30,636
Remember? I told you.
Neither one of us could promise a thing.

858
01:21:30,690 --> 01:21:34,225
Listen, promises blow away in the wind.

859
01:21:34,277 --> 01:21:36,186
But feelings are real.

860
01:21:36,238 --> 01:21:39,903
And I need to know
were the feelings lies, too?

861
01:21:39,950 --> 01:21:42,820
Listen, listen. What I mean is...

862
01:21:44,162 --> 01:21:45,407
are we real?

863
01:21:51,336 --> 01:21:56,212
I've gotta go, Gabriel. Good night.
- Wait. Don't go.

864
01:21:56,258 --> 01:21:57,800
Hold...

865
01:22:06,393 --> 01:22:08,053
Are you satisfied?

866
01:22:16,987 --> 01:22:19,561
Did you see them?

867
01:22:19,615 --> 01:22:22,782
Actually, we were in a hurry.
- Look.

868
01:22:33,337 --> 01:22:35,579
They are simply...

869
01:22:35,631 --> 01:22:36,794
wood?

870
01:22:56,110 --> 01:22:58,601
Oh, my God!
- Simply wood?

871
01:23:02,909 --> 01:23:05,365
It was 1917, Gabriel.

872
01:23:05,411 --> 01:23:08,116
Russia. People were starving.

873
01:23:08,164 --> 01:23:12,032
There were no jewels,
no diamonds left.

874
01:23:12,085 --> 01:23:13,579
No hope.

875
01:23:14,671 --> 01:23:18,254
Yet Czarina Alexandra
had to have her eggs.

876
01:23:20,385 --> 01:23:23,172
Perhaps you understand
why we had a revolution.

877
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:27,429
People needed
to believe in something.

878
01:23:30,729 --> 01:23:32,520
Take him home.

879
01:23:38,528 --> 01:23:39,691
Gabriel.

880
01:23:43,617 --> 01:23:47,318
I know what they say about me
but I'm not a killer.

881
01:23:48,497 --> 01:23:51,996
Merely a humble immigrant.

882
01:23:52,042 --> 01:23:53,750
Probably much like you.

883
01:23:55,504 --> 01:23:57,413
I don't think so, Mr Petrovich.

884
01:23:59,425 --> 01:24:01,583
You're not like me at all.

885
01:24:13,272 --> 01:24:16,641
Excellent. Thanks. We've got Petrovich.

886
01:24:16,692 --> 01:24:20,476
Snitch called it in. After all this time
looking for him, you know where he was?

887
01:24:20,529 --> 01:24:22,818
I'm sure you'll tell us.

888
01:24:22,865 --> 01:24:24,822
On the boardwalk,
watchin' the sun come up.

889
01:24:24,867 --> 01:24:28,319
He's coming in now.
I'll be right back.

890
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:35,328
Yeah, what I didn't count on
was that a so-called professional

891
01:24:35,378 --> 01:24:37,417
would be manipulated by a chick.

892
01:24:37,463 --> 01:24:39,255
What kind of cops
do they make in Miami?

893
01:24:39,298 --> 01:24:41,540
Good ones, Weber. Good ones.

894
01:24:41,592 --> 01:24:43,502
I don't get it.

895
01:24:43,553 --> 01:24:46,969
All these years in that world.
How do you let an asset use you?

896
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:51,138
Sometimes things... change.

897
01:24:51,186 --> 01:24:55,433
Things change?
Like, "which side am I on" change?

898
01:24:55,482 --> 01:24:58,020
Ripley, what is he,
your best friend now?

899
01:24:58,068 --> 01:25:00,060
Actually, a better friend than you.

900
01:25:00,111 --> 01:25:03,065
Ah, I get it. I'm the asshole.

901
01:25:03,114 --> 01:25:05,190
You're gonna tell me
what a good guy he is

902
01:25:05,242 --> 01:25:08,112
or how he got caught up
in a situation he couldn't control,

903
01:25:08,161 --> 01:25:10,831
or how the sins of the father
shouldn't rest on the daughter?

904
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:13,957
Give me something better
than, "things change"!

905
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,286
All I can give you is the truth.

906
01:25:19,131 --> 01:25:22,749
Oh, fuck it!
Go back to Miami, Martin.

907
01:25:25,387 --> 01:25:29,432
When your superiors get my report,
you'll be lucky if you have a job.

908
01:25:29,474 --> 01:25:31,384
We'll see.

909
01:25:31,435 --> 01:25:33,344
Hey, say anything
you want about Ripley

910
01:25:33,395 --> 01:25:35,886
but nothing changes
the fact that I finally got him.

911
01:25:35,939 --> 01:25:39,937
Now when he leaves prison,
he'll be leaving in a pine box.

912
01:25:41,403 --> 01:25:42,862
Let's go see Mr Petrovich.

913
01:25:57,086 --> 01:25:58,165
No.

914
01:26:04,969 --> 01:26:07,721
That's not Nicky Petrovich.
- What?

915
01:26:09,098 --> 01:26:10,129
Not him.

916
01:26:13,519 --> 01:26:17,019
Look, man, Organised Crime
confirmed it. That's Nicky Petrovich.

917
01:26:17,064 --> 01:26:19,852
Well, I don't care. That's not him!

918
01:26:19,901 --> 01:26:22,189
I was there, remember?

919
01:26:22,945 --> 01:26:25,104
There's no case here.

920
01:26:25,156 --> 01:26:28,940
What? Of course there's a case.
- Do you really think I'll put him on the stand?

921
01:26:28,993 --> 01:26:32,409
An undercover Miami cop
who may or may not be legit?

922
01:26:32,455 --> 01:26:33,570
No offence.
- None taken.

923
01:26:33,623 --> 01:26:36,743
A cop who's the centrepiece
of a botched undercover operation

924
01:26:36,793 --> 01:26:38,951
that was officially ordered stopped?

925
01:26:39,003 --> 01:26:41,755
I won't embarrass the Bureau,
much less your department,

926
01:26:41,798 --> 01:26:45,132
which accepted tons of money
and equipment from the Russian Mafia.

927
01:26:45,176 --> 01:26:49,008
What about Romanov's? What about
the goddamn stolen treasures of Russia?

928
01:26:49,055 --> 01:26:50,170
What about it, Weber?

929
01:26:50,223 --> 01:26:51,883
When Zykov found Ripley in the vault,

930
01:26:51,933 --> 01:26:54,341
he had everything cleared out
before you could get in.

931
01:26:54,394 --> 01:26:57,015
 I have a proposition for you.

932
01:26:57,063 --> 01:27:00,433
There's no way Romanov's
will press charges against Ripley.

933
01:27:00,484 --> 01:27:05,062
Cos they can never admit that the eggs
or anything else ever existed.

934
01:27:05,113 --> 01:27:08,031
So we can't even prove
that Detective Martin and Ripley

935
01:27:08,075 --> 01:27:09,403
stole even a goddamn dime!

936
01:27:09,451 --> 01:27:11,029
But you must have mug shots.

937
01:27:11,912 --> 01:27:14,237
Russian Mafia,
known associates, something!

938
01:27:38,439 --> 01:27:39,850
That's him.

939
01:27:41,275 --> 01:27:43,066
That's Nicky Petrovich.

940
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:45,518
Detective Martin...
- Yeah?

941
01:27:46,781 --> 01:27:48,607
That's Victor Korolenko.

942
01:27:59,752 --> 01:28:00,950
Presumed dead.

943
01:28:02,088 --> 01:28:04,294
We just never found the body.

944
01:28:08,803 --> 01:28:10,511
You never will...

945
01:28:11,764 --> 01:28:12,927
lieutenant.

946
01:28:58,729 --> 01:29:00,520
Weber.

947
01:29:00,564 --> 01:29:01,595
What?

948
01:29:01,648 --> 01:29:05,100
His lawyer got him in front of a judge
on an expedited bail hearing.

949
01:29:05,152 --> 01:29:06,694
Then he just walked.

950
01:29:06,737 --> 01:29:09,192
Who was it?
- Who was what?

951
01:29:09,239 --> 01:29:12,940
The lawyer.
- Who the fuck do you think?

952
01:29:12,993 --> 01:29:15,567
Alex. Korolenko.

953
01:29:38,561 --> 01:29:41,977
You can't promise me anything so...

954
01:29:42,023 --> 01:29:44,395
maybe we shouldn't even try.

955
01:30:25,192 --> 01:30:27,480
Papa.

956
01:30:28,862 --> 01:30:30,938
Shall we go?

957
01:30:42,376 --> 01:30:43,407
Yeah?

958
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:46,461
 Didn't wanna leave
without saying goodbye.

959
01:30:46,505 --> 01:30:49,078
I owe you one, Gaby.

960
01:30:49,133 --> 01:30:50,508
The real Nicky Petrovich

961
01:30:50,551 --> 01:30:53,552
is the one Zykov is funnelling
the contraband through.

962
01:30:55,014 --> 01:30:59,058
Thank you but Zykov and Petrovich
have gone to ground.

963
01:30:59,101 --> 01:31:01,770
Check out a disco called...
- Riga Rose?

964
01:31:01,812 --> 01:31:04,813
Ah, I see you're familiar
with the territory.

965
01:31:04,857 --> 01:31:07,728
Well... I am a cop, remember?

966
01:31:07,777 --> 01:31:09,650
I never forgot it for a second.

967
01:31:09,695 --> 01:31:11,604
When did you know?

968
01:31:11,655 --> 01:31:15,356
I knew you were coming up from
Miami before you did, Gaby.

969
01:31:15,409 --> 01:31:16,690
See, Weber and I...

970
01:31:16,744 --> 01:31:19,413
Well, let's just say
we share the same sources,

971
01:31:19,455 --> 01:31:20,949
only I pay better.

972
01:31:20,998 --> 01:31:22,540
Sir, we're good to go.

973
01:31:22,583 --> 01:31:25,157
So why the help, Ripley?

974
01:31:25,211 --> 01:31:27,204
Maybe feeling guilty?

975
01:31:28,881 --> 01:31:31,337
Guilt's not even in my vocabulary.

976
01:31:31,384 --> 01:31:33,756
I was just hoping
you'd see things differently.

977
01:31:35,930 --> 01:31:38,338
Together you and I could do anything.

978
01:31:39,851 --> 01:31:43,018
Yeah. I believe we did.

979
01:31:43,062 --> 01:31:46,313
I'll get in touch later on,
if you're interested.

980
01:31:46,357 --> 01:31:50,569
Meanwhile, I've got to keep an appointment with
a man who's going to pay dearly for something

981
01:31:50,612 --> 01:31:53,897
he's got to keep locked
in his basement just to say it's his.

982
01:31:56,201 --> 01:31:58,158
Good hunting, Gaby.
- Wait, wait, wait.

983
01:31:59,371 --> 01:32:01,280
Let me talk to her.
Just for a second.

984
01:32:01,331 --> 01:32:04,166
That's him?
- What makes you think she's going anywhere?

985
01:32:04,209 --> 01:32:05,668
She didn't commit any crime.

986
01:32:05,710 --> 01:32:09,079
She just lied to someone
who was lying to her.

987
01:32:20,475 --> 01:32:22,515
You be good.

988
01:32:22,561 --> 01:32:24,600
I'll try, Uncle Keith.

989
01:32:25,689 --> 01:32:29,983
Although I suspect
my legal career just ended.

990
01:32:30,027 --> 01:32:32,316
Thank God.

991
01:33:02,518 --> 01:33:06,350
You come in here every night
and every night I tell you

992
01:33:06,397 --> 01:33:09,848
I don't know shit
from this Petrovich.

993
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,733
This is a nightclub, my friend.

994
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:15,155
You know what I think?

995
01:33:16,407 --> 01:33:20,701
I think you need to check out the action
and get your ass laid.

996
01:33:20,745 --> 01:33:23,781
Yeah.
- You know what I'm sayin', dude?

997
01:33:23,831 --> 01:33:25,990
Find yourself a chick!

998
01:33:37,387 --> 01:33:40,388
Vodka.

999
01:33:41,725 --> 01:33:43,100
Zakuska?

1000
01:33:43,143 --> 01:33:45,266
Russian hors d'oeuvres
to coat the stomach.

1001
01:33:45,312 --> 01:33:46,592
Oh.

1002
01:33:47,689 --> 01:33:51,438
Will my stomach need coating?
- I hope so.

1003
01:33:51,485 --> 01:33:53,892
I thought you didn't drink.

1004
01:33:53,945 --> 01:33:55,356
You thought a lot of things,

1005
01:33:55,405 --> 01:33:58,988
but I believe I mentioned
something about making assumptions.

1006
01:33:59,034 --> 01:34:03,032
Maybe that's a concept
we should get rid of. Immediately.

1007
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:05,119
My name is Gabriel Martin.

1008
01:34:06,166 --> 01:34:07,447
I am from Miami.

1009
01:34:08,669 --> 01:34:13,580
I was actually looking for a lawyer
but the office was closed.

1010
01:34:13,632 --> 01:34:15,375
So...

1011
01:34:15,425 --> 01:34:17,133
I came here.

1012
01:34:21,265 --> 01:34:23,174
OK.

1013
01:34:23,225 --> 01:34:27,472
My name is Alexandra Korolenko

1014
01:34:27,521 --> 01:34:30,937
and I come from St. Petersburg.

1015
01:34:30,983 --> 01:34:33,023
By way of Little Odessa.

1016
01:34:34,361 --> 01:34:36,437
And...

1017
01:34:36,489 --> 01:34:38,113
I love to dance.

1018
01:34:39,617 --> 01:34:42,737
So... I came here tonight.

1019
01:34:48,834 --> 01:34:50,957
Do you wanna dance with me?

1020
01:34:53,464 --> 01:34:54,495
Yeah.

1021
01:34:57,260 --> 01:34:59,632
I'm willing to make a fool of myself.

1022
01:35:02,932 --> 01:35:04,806
Me too.

1023
01:35:06,602 --> 01:35:08,394
Alex...
- Yeah?

1024
01:35:08,438 --> 01:35:12,305
That night when I called you
from Coney Island,

1025
01:35:12,358 --> 01:35:14,849
you never answered my question.

1026
01:35:14,903 --> 01:35:16,361
Which one?

1027
01:35:17,697 --> 01:35:20,069
I wanted... I want to know...

1028
01:35:24,037 --> 01:35:25,448
Was it all lies?

1029
01:35:34,256 --> 01:35:36,379
Not the part that matters.

1030
01:35:37,884 --> 01:35:41,585
# Let's make a promise, you and me

1031
01:35:41,638 --> 01:35:43,382
# Let's just be honest

1032
01:35:43,432 --> 01:35:45,389
# We're gonna run

1033
01:35:45,434 --> 01:35:47,011
# Nothing can stop us...

1034
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:48,436
That was true.

1035
01:35:49,605 --> 01:35:52,060
That was real! I felt that!

1036
01:35:52,107 --> 01:35:54,728
That was real!
That was real! Finally!

1037
01:35:54,776 --> 01:35:58,192
# Beyond the clouds
over the mountains

1038
01:35:58,238 --> 01:36:01,903
# We'll run away on roads
that are empty

1039
01:36:01,950 --> 01:36:05,734
# Lights from the airfield
shining upon you

1040
01:36:05,788 --> 01:36:07,163
# Nothing can stop us

1041
01:36:07,206 --> 01:36:08,997
# Not now I love you

1042
01:36:09,041 --> 01:36:10,950
# They're not gonna get us

1043
01:36:11,001 --> 01:36:12,910
# They're not
gonna get us

1044
01:36:12,962 --> 01:36:14,504
# Nothing can stop us

1045
01:36:14,547 --> 01:36:16,255
# Not now I love you

1046
01:36:16,298 --> 01:36:18,255
# They're not gonna get us

1047
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:20,044
# They're not
gonna get us

1048
01:36:20,094 --> 01:36:23,794
# They're not gonna get us

1049
01:36:23,848 --> 01:36:27,347
# They're not
gonna get us

1050
01:36:27,393 --> 01:36:29,469
# They're not gonna get us

1051
01:36:35,192 --> 01:36:38,692
# We'll run away,
keep everything simple

1052
01:36:38,738 --> 01:36:42,522
# Night will come down,
our guardian angel

1053
01:36:42,575 --> 01:36:46,193
# We rush ahead,
the crossroads are empty

1054
01:36:46,245 --> 01:36:47,656
# Our spirits rise

1055
01:36:47,705 --> 01:36:49,745
# They're not gonna get us

1056
01:36:49,791 --> 01:36:53,539
# My love for you, always forever

1057
01:36:53,586 --> 01:36:55,413
# Just you and me

1058
01:36:55,463 --> 01:36:57,254
# All else is nothing

1059
01:36:57,298 --> 01:36:58,840
# Not going back

1060
01:36:58,883 --> 01:37:01,006
# Not going back there

1061
01:37:01,052 --> 01:37:02,594
# They don't understand

1062
01:37:02,637 --> 01:37:07,216
# They don't understand us

1063
01:37:12,063 --> 01:37:14,554
# Not gonna get us

1064
01:37:15,567 --> 01:37:19,517
# They're not gonna get us

1065
