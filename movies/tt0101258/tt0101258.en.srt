00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,765
20 Cent, 5 Cent added more
for bottle to be taken away

4
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:49,639
What's your name?

5
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,692
Why'd I tell you?

6
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,098
I've already known it

7
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,273
You're named...

8
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:22,872
So Lai-chun

9
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,579
Who told you that?

10
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,624
You'll see me tonight
in your dream

11
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,795
I didn't see you in
my dream last night

12
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,429
Of course,
you haven't slept at all

13
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:34,377
It's useless!
You'll see me, for sure

14
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,717
You look something special today

15
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,215
What? Nothing special

16
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,656
Nothing

17
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,455
Why do you have red ears?

18
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,893
What do you want?

19
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,494
I just want to make friends with you

20
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,192
Why should l?

21
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:37,668
Look at my watch!

22
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,502
Why should l?

23
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,712
Just one minute, OK?

24
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,128
Time's up, speak now

25
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,599
Today is...

26
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,504
16th

27
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,305
16th... April 16

28
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,011
April 16, 1960,

29
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,671
one minute before 3 pm

30
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,339
You are with me

31
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,745
Because of you,
I'll remember that one minute

32
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,255
From now on,
we're friends of one minute

33
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,054
This is fact, you can't deny it

34
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,919
Cause it's past

35
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,893
I'll come tomorrow

36
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,242
Haven't he remember
that minute for me?

37
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,179
I don't know

38
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,375
But I've memorized this guy

39
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,384
Later on, he did come everyday

40
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,882
We became friends,
started from that minute

41
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,157
...to 2 minutes

42
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,756
Later, we dated at least
an hour a day

43
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,114
How long have we known each other?

44
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,780
Very long... I've forgot

45
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,599
My cousin is going to
get marry soon

46
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,793
Really? Send my congratulation to her

47
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,964
She said that

48
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,974
she'd live with her husband's family

49
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,174
What's that mean?

50
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,976
I've to find some place else to live

51
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,095
I'd like to live with you

52
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,009
So, how should I tell my dad?

53
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,383
Tell what?

54
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,655
Our affair!

55
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,281
What affair?

56
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,730
Would you marry me?

57
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,708
No!

58
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,332
I'll never come back

59
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,507
Didi, be quick, come over here

60
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,779
Your mother has drunk,
she has drunk too much

61
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,086
I'm in a hurry

62
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:17,705
Give her a cup of tea

63
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,638
Are you hungry?
Do you want something to eat?

64
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,969
Who's that guy?

65
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,810
Only one pair of earring,

66
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,276
take it back if you want to

67
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,918
I don't think that it all you have stolen

68
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,286
I've told you many times
that I never stolen!

69
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,723
She gave it to me willingly

70
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,532
You mean she was willing
to pay for your living?

71
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:46,831
Do you think it's so easy to do so?

72
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:50,908
Don't beat me...

73
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:53,205
Then?

74
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,642
Stop beating me!

75
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,712
What?

76
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,608
What? Say it out...

77
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,308
Louder!

78
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:00,316
I stole it!

79
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,181
Louder!

80
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,810
It's me, I stole it...

81
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:07,949
I don't want you to see
my mother again

82
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,242
you can change now

83
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,784
Have you seen any earring?

84
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,550
No, but I can look it up for you

85
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,693
Hey, what are you doing here?

86
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,446
You like this earring?

87
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,241
For you

88
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,386
Hey!

89
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,556
Why only one?

90
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,834
I'll wait for you downstairs

91
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,942
Who's place is it?

92
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:10,840
My home

93
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,317
I've never promised to
go home with you

94
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,246
But you've never refused

95
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,498
Are you living alone?

96
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,669
Is the rent high?

97
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,403
$40

98
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,778
Wow, my family live in a room

99
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,885
which costs $28 only

100
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,156
Do you bring girls home oftenly?

101
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:58,925
Sometimes

102
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,736
Let's make a deal,
I'll stay a while only

103
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,676
It's stuffy

104
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,482
Are there many families
living here?

105
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,986
Why it's empty?

106
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,329
You're nosy, aren't you?

107
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:39,869
Where's the toilet?

108
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,241
Let's go & eat something

109
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,647
Why don't you say earlier?

110
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,622
It's raining heavily

111
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,955
I'd better leave now,
take me home

112
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,559
Why did you come with me then?

113
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,295
I've just promised to stay a while,

114
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:13,928
who do you think I am?

115
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,169
Don't think that
I can easily go to bed with men

116
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,368
Don't think that you can
do anything

117
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,910
be sending me a pair
of poor earring

118
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,276
I'm different from those
flapperish girls!

119
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,381
Don't come over

120
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,118
Guess how long you can
stop breathing

121
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,056
Thief! Who's that?

122
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,352
It's me!

123
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:42,687
My friend

124
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,429
I've told you many times
that you'd not climb up

125
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,868
I don't want the lndian guard
to bother me

126
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,870
I don't know that you've a friend here,
I leave now

127
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,983
Take the stairs

128
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,619
Where I come, where I go

129
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,947
Your friend is strange,
what's he?

130
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,392
Don't be nosy!

131
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,169
Is he a thief?

132
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:45,953
What time is it?

133
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:52,590
3 am

134
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,167
I've to go home now

135
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,453
Shall we meet tomorrow?

136
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,124
May be

137
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,930
Well, call me

138
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,130
Do you have my phone number?

139
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,035
I'll write it down

140
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,455
Call after 1 1,

141
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,222
or I won't be there

142
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,933
Leung Fung-ying?
Aren't you called Lulu?

143
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,240
My colleagues don't know
my Christian name

144
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,076
Keep your promise to call, OK?

145
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,870
OK

146
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,154
I know you won't call me

147
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,291
I will

148
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,532
You don't even memorize
my number!

149
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,564
It's written down, why should l
keep this in mind then?

150
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,301
How about if it lost?

151
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,177
if it is lost,

152
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,111
I may be lost too

153
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,645
Go & lost it, if you dare!

154
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,776
If you lose it,

155
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,251
I will cut your face!

156
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,256
Stop saying that to me

157
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,010
You're great!

158
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,673
Where there's an illness,
there's a cure!

159
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,179
Are you going home?

160
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,487
I'll call you a cab

161
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,636
I don't want to go home now

162
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,169
Well, stay here then

163
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:58,847
Go to hell!

164
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,277
Good morning

165
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:37,417
Why you still sitting here?
Why don't you go home?

166
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,490
You haven't gone home too

167
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,852
I'm not going to talk to you

168
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,019
Hey!

169
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,460
Have I ever met you before?

170
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,996
I don't think so

171
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,563
But, have you ever noticed me?

172
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,596
You know it pretty well

173
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,239
What's your job?

174
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,371
My job?

175
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,812
Turn the volume of the
radio louder please

176
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,897
Any idea? Got it?

177
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:28,832
Not yet

178
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:30,873
Dance once more for me OK?

179
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,708
Do you want to take
advantage from me?

180
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,415
Hey... What's your name?

181
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,176
Call me Mimi

182
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:12,107
I've heard that there was

183
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,115
a kind of bird with no legs

184
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,252
It could fly and fly only...

185
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,381
When it got tired,
it slept in the wind

186
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,391
This kind of bird
could land only once

187
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,022
That was the time it died

188
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,441
Auntie

189
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,011
Come here, I want to talk to you

190
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,786
Excuse me

191
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:30,426
Hey, who is she?

192
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:32,154
What do you mean?

193
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:33,987
What?

194
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:37,935
Why did you beat him?

195
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,661
He tried to cheat your money!

196
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,239
Who said so?

197
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:44,868
No one

198
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,675
If not why should he be with you?

199
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:51,109
How old is he?
And how old are you?

200
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:52,813
You are not young!

201
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,253
Right, he does it for money,

202
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,822
but he can make me happy

203
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:01,721
Have you ever made me happy
after so many years?

204
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,986
Have you?

205
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,390
Right, I never made you
happy before

206
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,895
Then, let's be unhappy together

207
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,260
What do you want?

208
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,992
You know it pretty well

209
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:16,569
I've told you many times

210
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,573
I won't tell you anymore

211
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,978
You want to find your
own mother, right?

212
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:23,012
Go and find her yourself
if you can

213
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:24,940
I've taken care of you
for so many years,

214
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:27,918
Anything I want to say,
I have said it long ago

215
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,018
I didn't say it before because
I don't want you to leave

216
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,117
And I won't say it now still

217
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,984
Cause I don't think it's worth to

218
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:38,824
I tell you,

219
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,592
...what can I get if
you go to find her?

220
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,360
Nothing!

221
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,999
And you will forget me as well

222
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:52,073
Why are you starring at me?

223
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:56,671
OK, I want you to hate me

224
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,715
At least, you won't forget me

225
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,015
Come on, treat me better

226
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:11,687
Maybe, I will tell you some day

227
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:14,031
If not, never dream so

228
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:20,594
Alright, I will wait for
that moment

229
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,836
Is his mother rich?

230
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:32,310
I think so, she used to be
a prostitute before

231
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:35,408
You know York for long?

232
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:44,021
He lived in the flat up
above our garage

233
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:47,423
Do you know

234
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:50,090
what is in his mind?

235
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,032
I don't know

236
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:57,299
But I know what is in your mind

237
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,099
What?

238
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,208
Don't fall in love with me

239
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:21,693
It's so late, what're you doing here?

240
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,957
Waiting for my friend

241
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:31,370
What's the matter?

242
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:34,273
A girl downstairs said
that she was your friend,

243
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,073
you'd better go & have a look

244
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,912
Excuse me

245
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:54,995
Why do you come for me?

246
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,464
I'd like to take back my stuffs

247
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,367
Come up then

248
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:38,732
I'd like to stay with you

249
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,401
What for?

250
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:42,845
I'm not suitable for you

251
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:49,979
I don't like marriage
like the others do

252
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:11,873
I don't mind

253
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,513
I just want to stay with you

254
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:26,947
Why are you so attentive to me?

255
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,725
You can't please me
for my whole life!

256
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,228
You won't be happy to stay with me

257
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,813
Have you ever loved me?

258
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,218
I don't know how many women
else I'd fall for in my life

259
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,628
I won't know whom I love
most till the end of my life

260
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,506
Wait here

261
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,635
I'll collect the things for you

262
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:24,813
Somebody's home?

263
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:10,660
Who is outside?

264
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:12,319
Don't be nosy!

265
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:43,324
Take off you slippers

266
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,026
Why?

267
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,797
It belongs to someone else

268
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,563
It's hers? Who say so?
Any proof here?

269
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,396
Are you going to take it off?

270
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,097
No!

271
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:56,901
A woman comes up suddenly,

272
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,702
...and she claims that this is hers,
that is hers,

273
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:01,073
How can I know how many women
would come up later?

274
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:02,971
If one comes & says
that you are hers,

275
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,638
should I give up?

276
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:06,181
I give nothing

277
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,376
Once I step in here,
everything is mine

278
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:20,459
Why you come up?
I've told you to stay downstairs

279
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,262
I'm leaving

280
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,480
Well, sleep with the
slippers tonight

281
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:41,651
Are you care about the slippers?
OK, I'll return it to her

282
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:46,549
Are you satisfied?

283
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,787
Somehow, nothing in this
house belongs to me!

284
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,528
What am l? I'd better leave!

285
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,713
Don't come back once you step out

286
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,689
Do you treat all women like this?

287
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,883
I won't be as stupid as her!

288
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,667
What are you doing?

289
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,469
Why do you treat me like this?

290
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,370
Stop it, I'm hurt...

291
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,709
How come it's you again?
Why don't you go home?

292
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:57,819
Many trouble will be solved
after a good sleep

293
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,860
Can you lend me few dollars
for me to take a cab?

294
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,845
I've only $5, is that enough?

295
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:05,288
How can I pay you back?

296
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:07,853
Forget it

297
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,520
I'm always on duty around here

298
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:15,093
A chance may be, take it

299
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:50,794
It's you

300
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,531
I'm taking the money back to you

301
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,599
No hurry, it doesn't matter

302
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,342
Sorry about that

303
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:05,579
Thanks! Are you alright?

304
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,416
I'm leaving now,
I have to go to work

305
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:12,981
So late at night?
What kind of job?

306
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,258
I am working in the SCAA

307
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:18,562
There's games holding tonight,
I've to work in the box office

308
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:24,927
Then I can have free ticket
for football match

309
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,499
I like football match before,

310
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,367
but now, I'm busy

311
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,873
If you want to see
any game in future,

312
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,877
just come to me

313
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,510
Then thanks a lot

314
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,217
Bye

315
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,299
Can we chat?

316
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:41,244
I can't help you about
your boyfriend

317
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,310
I just want to chat

318
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:46,143
You got no friends?

319
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,674
I don't want others to know it

320
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:50,912
Then how about me?

321
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,550
If I don't...

322
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,866
If I don't say it out,
I'm afraid that I'd be mad

323
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,809
I thought that I would be OK

324
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,081
I always tell myself

325
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:23,885
Don't tell others that
you are unhappy

326
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,886
Work hard

327
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,189
Go home and sleep earlier

328
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:37,894
I want to go home!

329
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,167
But my home is in Macao

330
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:50,142
I don't know how to
kill these nights

331
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:53,106
I can't sleep

332
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:03,860
I don't mean to come back

333
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:06,790
I promise myself that

334
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,865
I wouldn't go back anymore

335
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:13,896
I'll hate myself if I go back again

336
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,069
I don't want to hate myself

337
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,411
Help me please

338
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:13,925
You can't be like this still

339
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,661
I will be OK by getting
through this night

340
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,237
You are cheating yourself
by saying this only

341
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:32,910
How did you pass last night?

342
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:35,580
If you had passed last night,

343
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,880
you wouldn't have been here

344
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:44,517
You should make up your mind

345
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:48,058
If you really can't live without him,

346
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:51,892
...why don't you tell him?

347
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:56,203
If not, pretend not
knowing this guy

348
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:56,829
from this very minute

349
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:59,238
Don't mention "this very minute"

350
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:10,646
I always think that a minute
can pass very fast

351
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:14,648
But sometimes it takes long

352
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,095
One day, one pointed at
his watch and told me,

353
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:29,600
...he would remember me
forever for that very minute

354
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:34,440
It was very pleasant to me

355
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,115
But now when I look at the watch,

356
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:52,059
...l will tell myself,

357
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:55,593
...l have to forget that guy

358
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:57,997
from that very minute

359
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:13,744
When I was young in Macao,
I dreamed to ride on a tram

360
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,289
Whenever my cousin returned
from Hong Kong

361
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:23,392
I would ask her when would
she take me to HK

362
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,388
Your cousin is from Hong Kong?

363
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:32,734
No, but she studied in
HK when young

364
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:35,868
She is great,

365
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:40,374
she got a job in an office
just after graduation

366
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,572
And her boyfriend is
smart as well

367
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:47,877
She is going to get married soon

368
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:54,286
Not everyone will be
in good luck

369
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:00,391
Don't compare with others

370
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:05,959
I didn't think that
I was poor before

371
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,429
Till I found out that

372
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:13,604
I didn't have a new uniform every year

373
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:17,745
But my classmates all had new ones

374
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,842
At that moment,

375
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,217
I realised that I was poor

376
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:34,587
What make you to be a police then?

377
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,133
I wanted to be a sailor

378
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,269
But my mother's health
was not so good

379
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:48,707
And there was no others at home

380
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:50,613
So I had to stay over to
take care of her

381
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,790
Don't you think it's bored
walking around all the night?

382
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:09,260
I don't think so

383
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:31,681
I'm tired, I want to go
home now

384
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:35,719
If there are anyone
who can talk to,

385
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,691
...come to me

386
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:40,427
But I don't want to interfere

387
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:41,997
your working hours

388
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:46,492
You can phone me then

389
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:51,072
I am here around this
time everyday

390
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:57,870
Hey, do you have enough
money for the fare?

391
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:00,512
Yes, bye

392
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:16,030
I never dream that
she will call me

393
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:19,662
But I always stop in front of

394
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,463
the telephone kiosk

395
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:28,434
Maybe she has returned to Macao

396
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:34,683
Or maybe she just wants someone
to kill a night with her

397
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:39,515
No soon, my mother past away

398
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:43,119
Then I changed to be a sailor

399
00:47:44,305 --> 00:48:44,798
