Synedyne Technical Support.
This is Suzanne. How can I help you?

36
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,584
Synedyne Technical Support.
This is Rachel. How can I help you?

37
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,795
This is Elliot.
How can I help you?

38
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,548
Oh, wow.

39
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,509
Yeah, okay.
Give me a second to find you here.

40
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,803
My computer's running
a little slow today.

41
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,264
Wake up, fella.
There you are.

42
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,641
Hey, you got yourself
a model 5732.

43
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,227
128 megs of RAM,
27 gig hard drive.

44
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,814
Good. Good. And you say that
it hangs every time you print?

45
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,358
Wow!
All right, no problem.

46
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,069
Can you hold for two seconds?

47
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,946
Carol! Carol.

48
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,468
I don't know what
you've been told, little lady,

49
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,744
but the rest of us start at nine.

50
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,831
Kidding, I'm just kidding.
Good morning.

51
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,626
Hey, Dan, my man!
What's up, my bro?

52
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,879
Yeah, put it there!
All right. Yeah.

53
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:18,132
So hoops today? You and the guys
up for some hoopage after work?

54
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,718
Uh, you know,
we don't know yet, Elliot.

55
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,429
- I'm not sure yet, okay?
- That's cool. Just let me know.

56
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,075
'Cause I'm there, bud. That's right,
'cause I love the round ball.

57
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,726
That's why they call me "Air Elliot."

58
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,438
- Yeah!
- Okay.

59
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,899
Make sure that you
let me know the right time

60
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,442
because last week you said 6:30

61
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,421
and when I got there,
you guys were just leaving.

62
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,738
I mean, how stupid did you feel?

63
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,949
Pretty stupid, Elliot.

64
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,284
Not a problem, Danny.
Give it up.

65
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,620
- Hey, Daniel.
- Hey, man, how you doing?

66
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,372
Good, good.
How you doing, man?

67
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,460
Hey, Bob!

68
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,629
- What's up?
- Hey, Elliot.

69
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,674
You and your posse
gonna hit the brewery tonight?

70
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,926
My "posse"?
No.

71
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:05,346
Uh, they're all busy with the big...

72
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,473
- What's with your neck?
- Oh, nothing.

73
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:11,310
It's a repetitive stress disorder.
It's a headset injury.

74
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,729
So what do you say you and me
go and knock back some suds

75
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,147
and check out the babes?

76
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,733
Elliot, I'm married, remember?

77
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,319
I'm gonna go home,
spend some time with my wife.

78
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,654
Oh.

79
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:25,074
Taking a trip to Whipville.

80
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,371
It just gets funnier
every time you do that.

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,208
Don't, don't, don't...

82
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,668
Hey, Jerry!

83
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,921
Jerry, Jerry, Bo-berry,
fee-fi-fo-ferry, Jerry!

84
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,506
Hey, what's happening, brother?

85
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,508
- Running to an important meeting.
- Oh, yeah.

86
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,676
- Yeah.
- Hey, wait.

87
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,444
No, I think you're gonna
appreciate this,

88
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,490
because we're both a couple
of stereo component nuts.

89
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,534
Check these out, Holmes.
These are the new Ingebritzens.

90
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,766
- Right.
- XVC speakers.

91
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,935
Here, look it.
That's the back of the left speaker

92
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,812
and the front of the right speaker.

93
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,313
Sweet, sweet, sweet.

94
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,641
That's the front of the left...
no, that's the right...

95
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,533
I think... oh, man!

96
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,535
- What?
- It's Elliot.

97
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,953
Who told him we were here?

98
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,664
- Oh, shit.
- Did you tell him we were here?

99
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,212
Hi!

100
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,841
You guys!

101
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,551
I told you not to...

102
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,929
Well, well, well,
isn't this a big surprise?

103
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,723
I thought everybody was busy.

104
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,600
A slight change of plans, Elliot.

105
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,852
Oh, is that right?

106
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,937
Well, I'm a little bit peeved
at you guys.

107
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,357
I'm thinking you tried to ditch me.
I might not even sit down with you.

108
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,885
We can certainly understand that,
so we'll see you tomorrow.

109
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,696
- Later, Elliot.
- I'm kidding!

110
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,490
- Switch places with me.
- No, I'm fine.

111
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,210
- What?
- Oh, my goodness gracious.

112
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,711
You've gotta be kidding!

113
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,588
Please, please, don't tell me

114
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,356
that you have a thing for Alison
Gardner.

115
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,549
- Oh, man!
- Please.

116
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,760
She's way out of your league.

117
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,554
Isn't she dating that guy in research?

118
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:11,972
Brian, with the teeth.

119
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,933
Brian?
The guy with the teeth.

120
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,435
No, that's been over
for three months now.

121
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:20,981
- Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
- I know a lot of things about her.

122
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,692
I know that she likes her bagels
buttered, but not toasted.

123
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,653
- Wow.
- How specific.

124
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,405
I know that she looks beautiful
in any color,

125
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,450
but when she wears blue...

126
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:35,121
Sounds like you guys
are old friends?

127
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,648
Well, we have been
working together

128
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,958
at the same company
for four years.

129
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,293
You spend time together,
people get to know each other.

130
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,295
It's true,
so it should be no problem

131
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,623
for you to just get up,
walk over there, and say hello.

132
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,925
She's with somebody.
I'll catch up with her tomorrow.

133
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,219
- Come on!
- Hold on, Elliot.

134
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,595
Come clean here.

135
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,849
You have never spoken
to Alison Gardner, right?

136
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,142
Of course I have.

137
00:07:56,309 --> 00:08:00,938
- Did I say "queer" earlier?
- You are pathetic, Elliot! Really.

138
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,858
Okay, I guess you guys are just
not gonna let me relax tonight

139
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,461
until I go over there and say hello.

140
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,605
- I guess not.
- Yeah.

141
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,156
Well, if that'll make you happy.
You think I'm pathetic.

142
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,618
- Don't touch me.
- Go for it, tiger.

143
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:15,828
Good luck.

144
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,214
- Hi.
- Hi.

145
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,465
Do I know you?

146
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,885
Oh, I should hope so.

147
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,346
We've only been working together
at Synedyne for the last four years.

148
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,349
I'm Elliot Richards.

149
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,684
We've spoken.

150
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,312
I'm sorry, I don't...

151
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,356
It was the first week of June,
three years ago.

152
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,942
I said it was wet out.

153
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,362
We were standing in the lobby,
and I said it was really wet out.

154
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,698
It was raining at the time.

155
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,366
I assume that.

156
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:56,911
Yeah.

157
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,876
So here we are, talking again.

158
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,294
Yeah.

159
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,423
Well, take it easy.

160
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,849
I'm here with friends
and I was wondering if you wanted...

161
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:37,868
Dear God, I would give anything
to have that girl in my life.

162
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:23,372
- Hi.
- Hello.

163
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,957
I was wondering...

164
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,834
if this is...

165
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,630
I was standing over there and...

166
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:35,884
You're very glib.
I bet you're a whiz with the ladies.

167
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,137
- Well...
- You here alone?

168
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,680
No!

169
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,016
I'm here with
some buddies from work.

170
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,227
I saw you talking to a woman.

171
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,480
Yeah, but I'm not with her.

172
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,150
But you'd like to be, huh?

173
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,068
What makes you say that?

174
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,486
I don't know.

175
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,322
When a man says
he'd give anything

176
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,990
to have a certain woman in his life,

177
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,950
I just assume
she means something to him.

178
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,785
How did you hear me say that?

179
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,663
- I was standing way over...
- I have fantastic hearing.

180
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,916
And a number of other
equally impressive talents.

181
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,175
Ho-doggie!

182
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,721
Let's go someplace quiet
so we can talk.

183
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,810
Okay... what?
You want to talk to me?

184
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,604
Is there a problem?

185
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,023
Are you not attracted to me?

186
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,358
No.

187
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,028
I think you're hot.

188
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,739
Baby, you have no idea.

189
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:48,165
- Kiss me.
- What? Here?

190
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:52,044
Don't be afraid
to explore new horizons.

191
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,212
Oh.

192
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,138
Can you give us
two seconds, girls?

193
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,808
Yeah, can you give us two seconds?

194
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,226
Sure.

195
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,560
Whatever.

196
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,065
Listen...

197
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,069
you seem really nice,

198
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,279
in a strong,

199
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,198
scary kind of a way,

200
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,575
but my friends
are probably waiting for me,

201
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,578
so I'm gonna just get going.

202
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,123
You're so nervous, Elliot.

203
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,916
How do you know my name?

204
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,626
I'm psychic.

205
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,294
Plus, it's on your name tag.

206
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,381
Duh.

207
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:40,717
Now then, I just want
to talk business for a second.

208
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:44,930
Oh, I'm not into that.

209
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,766
I mean, I've never paid
for sex before.

210
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,519
Except this one time...
there was an Internet thing.

211
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,527
I mean, you can't help it. Every time
you sign on, it's "sex, sex, sex."

212
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,246
I'm not a hooker, you silly boy.
I just want to ask you a question.

213
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,653
How would you like to make
one simple decision

214
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,197
that'll change your life forever?

215
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,410
Okay, I'm glad Scientology
works for you, but...

216
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,287
Just listen.

217
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,457
What if I told you that
I have the cataclysmic power

218
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,377
to give you anything and everything
you've always dreamed of?

219
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,130
Who are you?

220
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,966
Promise not to tell anyone?

221
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,176
Okay.

222
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,179
Cross your heart and hope to die?

223
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:27,639
Yeah.

224
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,227
I'm the devil.

225
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,816
Okay.

226
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:41,236
I think somebody's had
"tee many martoonis"!

227
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:44,406
I am the devil.
Satan, Lucifer, Beelzebub.

228
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,616
The Prince of Darkness.

229
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,994
Well, the Princess of Darkness,
anyway.

230
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,329
Here's my card.

231
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,747
Oh.

232
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,833
"The devil." Yep.

233
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,294
That explains it.

234
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,837
Now I believe you.

235
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,673
Night-night.

236
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,846
You're a very skeptical person,
you know that?

237
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,181
How did...

238
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,433
How did you just...
and you...

239
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:16,188
Look. If you could just buy into
this "I'm the devil" thing,

240
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,482
it'll save us both
a lot of these questions.

241
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,859
Maybe I should call you a cab.

242
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:24,363
Although it's gonna be hard to find one
that'll go to hell this time of night.

243
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,157
Oh! What a delightfully piquant wit.

244
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,285
I can see we're gonna
get along famously.

245
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,287
Cheers, darling.

246
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,709
Are you... you can't...
look at... jeez!

247
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:42,673
You can't do that.
That's very dangerous!

248
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,551
Why is this so hard
for you to believe?

249
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,887
Do you think your mommy and daddy
just made me up so you'd be good?

250
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,391
Okay, okay. You're the devil.
What do you want with me?

251
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,811
I want you to be happy, Elliot.
You have such potential.

252
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,355
All you need is a little push
in the right direction.

253
00:14:58,523 --> 00:14:59,856
I am happy!

254
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,901
Oh, please!
You don't have to lie to me.

255
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,238
I know every dark thought
in your tiny little mind.

256
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,616
I know that every night you go home
to your horrible little apartment

257
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:13,078
and you eat your little frozen dinner,
and you make your little bowl of popcorn

258
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:17,082
and watch TV until you can't keep
your eyes open anymore.

259
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,459
And then you crawl off to bed

260
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:23,255
and wonder why you're alone
and nobody likes you.

261
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,300
Not every night.

262
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,260
And you cry.

263
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,599
Yeah, sure.

264
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,436
I know what's in your heart, Elliot.

265
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,479
You could cry right now.

266
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,447
I'm talking about reinvention,
taking control of your destiny.

267
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,532
You want to be liked?

268
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,284
You want to be loved?

269
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,369
How about respected?

270
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,913
How about feared?

271
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,419
What exactly are we talking about?

272
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,880
You want to see how it works, baby?

273
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,381
Wish for something.

274
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,967
- Like what?
- Whatever you want, it's yours.

275
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,969
Just say the word.

276
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,472
Okay,

277
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,267
I wish I had a Big Mac
and a large Coke.

278
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,394
It is done.

279
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,985
Hi, how you doing?
What can I get you?

280
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,987
A Big Mac and a large Coke.

281
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,280
Fries?

282
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,407
No.

283
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,368
Comes to $3.47.

284
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,330
Do you have $3.47?

285
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,625
I left my purse in the underworld.

286
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:46,171
Oh, yes!
This truly is the work of the devil!

287
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,341
And to think that I doubted you!
I'm gonna go now.

288
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,343
What's the problem?

289
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,845
This doesn't prove anything!

290
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,015
I could have done this myself.
I even had to pay for it.

291
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:00,769
No such thing as a free lunch.
Didn't anyone ever tell you that?

292
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,396
I didn't even get any fries.

293
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,272
Oh, I don't believe this.

294
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,358
I'm offering you
the opportunity of a lifetime

295
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,277
and all you can do is moan
about French fries?

296
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,488
- Good night.
- Oh, fine! Okay.

297
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:15,033
I'm obviously not getting through
to you, so let's just forget it.

298
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,953
Come on, I'll give you
a lift back to your car.

299
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:21,957
That's your car?

300
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,667
- It's him!
- It's Elliot!

301
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,258
Elliot, right here.

302
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,218
I love you, Elliot!

303
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,346
Where are we?

304
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,141
Just a little after-hours club I own.

305
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,436
We'd better get in there.
Everyone's waiting for you.

306
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,771
Everyone who?

307
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,397
All your friends.

308
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,275
How you doing, Mr. Richards?

309
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,402
Elliot, one picture!

310
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,218
- Hey! Hey, Elliot!
- No way! This is your club?

311
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,385
It sure is.

312
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:02,724
Wow.

313
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,268
Yeah, baby!

314
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:08,313
- Hello, Elliot.
- Hello.

315
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,732
- Elliot, dance with me.
- No, dance with me.

316
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,901
No, he's gonna dance with me first.

317
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,821
Okay, girls, that's enough.
Break it up. He belongs to me.

318
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,824
How the hell are you?
Somebody take a picture of us.

319
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,409
- Hold it!
- Excellent.

320
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,495
Hi, Elliot.

321
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,626
I think she likes you, too.

322
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,212
- Are you hungry?
- Uh-huh. Sort of.

323
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,672
- Look.
- Wow!

324
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,216
These look just like the cookies
my grandma used to make.

325
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:37,968
- Try one.
- Okay.

326
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,470
These are the cookies
that my grandma used to make!

327
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,974
I aim to please, handsome.
Come on.

328
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,475
How did you...

329
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,355
- You liked that, didn't you?
- What, the cookie?

330
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,192
Having all those people
excited to see you.

331
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,361
It's nice to feel accepted, isn't it?

332
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,488
I can give you that.

333
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:01,408
I can make the whole world
love you.

334
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:04,369
- Come on!
- You still don't believe me, do you?

335
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,329
Of course not!

336
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:10,041
First of all,
you look nothing like the devil.

337
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,378
Oh, really? I suppose I could
have gone this way.

338
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:19,009
But it's so trick-or-treat.

339
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,886
It's true!

340
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,804
You really are the devil!

341
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,890
Oh, come on, baby.

342
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,474
Come and sit down.

343
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,853
I know this has all been
horribly overwhelming for you.

344
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:32,606
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure, you can.

345
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,399
You can ask me anything you'd like.

346
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,086
As long as you don't ask me
if there's a God.

347
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,821
I get that one all the time.
It drives me absolutely bonkers.

348
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,283
Yes, there's a God.

349
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:46,036
Really?
Well, what's He like?

350
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,456
You'd think meeting the devil
would be interesting enough,

351
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:52,083
but all they want
to know about is Him!

352
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,085
Like He's so bloody fascinating.

353
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,879
- So He's a man?
- Yeah.

354
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:59,257
Most men think they're God.
This one just happens to be right.

355
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:03,178
Now listen, darling.
I don't want to pressure you,

356
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:06,222
but why don't we take
a teensy little look at the contract?

357
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:13,939
What the...
it's pretty...

358
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:21,279
"I, Elliot Richards,
hereafter known as 'the Damned'...

359
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,449
- "the Damned"?
- How about "the Darned"? Better?

360
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,035
Don't get hung up
on the language, darling.

361
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:31,081
There's nothing sinister here.
It's all standard boilerplate.

362
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,125
Paragraph one
states that "I, the devil",

363
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:38,004
a nonprofit corporation with offices
in purgatory, hell, and L.A.,

364
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:41,007
"will give you seven wishes
to use as you see fit."

365
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:44,427
Seven?
Why not eight?

366
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:48,139
Why not six? I don't know.
Seven just sounds right.

367
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:52,477
Paragraph two outlines the manner
in which you'll pay for the wishes.

368
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,938
What? Are you kidding?!
I have to give you my soul?

369
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:56,815
After you've had your wishes,
of course.

370
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,484
But it's my soul!

371
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,569
I can't give you my soul!

372
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,321
What are you?
James Brown?

373
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,824
What's the big deal?
Have you ever seen your soul?

374
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:09,661
- Do you even know what it is?
- Of course, it's the thing that...

375
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,331
No, that's...
it floats around...

376
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,792
Can I tell you something?

377
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,754
Souls are overrated.
They don't really do anything.

378
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,048
Has yours done anything
for you so far?

379
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,718
No, it's like your appendix.

380
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,177
You'll never even miss it.

381
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,639
Well, if it's so useless,
then why do you want it so much?

382
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:32,017
Ooh, aren't you the clever one?

383
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,937
Look, who's really making out
in this deal here?

384
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:39,065
Seven utterly fabulous wishes

385
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,817
for one piddling little soul?

386
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,777
Well, I don't know.

387
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,321
What have we here?

388
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,703
Wait. Who is...

389
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,246
Alison?

390
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,082
How did you...

391
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,919
She is so beautiful.

392
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,381
- I've waited for you for so long.
- Who's that?

393
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,569
- I've waited for you for so long.
- Who's she with?

394
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:09,012
- I want you now, my love.
- Why are you showing me this?

395
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,391
Oh, I love your hair like that.

396
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,269
You must go through
conditioner like crazy.

397
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,230
Is this real?

398
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:23,026
It could be.
All you have to do is sign.

399
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:25,028
And you promise I'll get her?

400
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:27,396
That's really up to you.
You're the one with the wishes.

401
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:31,910
But I promise I'll do
everything in my power.

402
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,620
Sign it, Elliot.

403
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:46,841
Please, Elliot. I'm waiting, Elliot.

404
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,785
Great!

405
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:17,163
Now before you start wishing,
you'll be needing this.

406
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:20,125
If for any reason your wish
isn't going the way you hoped,

407
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,294
just take out the pager, hit 666,

408
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,922
and it'll bring you
right back to me.

409
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,384
Why wouldn't it go the way
that I'd hoped?

410
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:32,095
I was just throwing that out
as a for instance.

411
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:35,723
Every wish is gonna be
100 percent fabulous.

412
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,519
But you'll find that out
as soon as you make one.

413
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:43,356
- So I should make one now?
- Well, if you don't mind.

414
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,150
I've got places to go,

415
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,987
people to condemn to
an eternity of fiery torment.

416
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,614
Okay, let me think.

417
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:56,286
- I... I want to be married to Alison.
- You got it.

418
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,163
That's not all.
I want to be rich.

419
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,914
Always a popular choice.

420
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,291
That's not all.

421
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:05,253
I want to be very rich
and very powerful.

422
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:09,132
Ooh, even better.
Remember, you have to say, "I wish."

423
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,009
Right.

424
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:14,345
I wish that I were
married to Alison

425
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,056
and that I were very, very rich
and very powerful.

426
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,684
- How's that sound?
- Sounds good to me.

427
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,644
Enjoy.

428
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,004
Roberto.

429
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:07,263
"I am is to visiting
in the Los Angeles

430
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:10,558
for the time of vacations."

431
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,770
"Idioto"!

432
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:07,438
Alejandro?

433
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,273
Roberto? Esteban?

434
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,701
Mama!

435
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,025
Seis, seis, seis!

436
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,035
Back so soon?

437
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,960
You turned me into a drug dealer!

438
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,545
They almost killed me!

439
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,422
You asked for rich and powerful.

440
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,133
- Not like that.
- Goes with the territory, babe.

441
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:02,052
"Root of all evil."
Ring any bells?

442
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,847
But what about Alison?
What got into her?

443
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:06,891
I think it was Raoul.

444
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,059
Yeah!
That's not what I wished for.

445
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,353
Well, hold on now, mister.

446
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,564
You wished that
the two of you were married.

447
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,900
You didn't say anything
about her loving you.

448
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,903
You know, when two people
get married, I assume that...

449
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,905
There's your mistake.

450
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,908
- May I suggest something?
- What?

451
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,275
The rich and powerful thing
wasn't really the way to go.

452
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,496
Everyone wishes for that first thing
out of the gate and it never pans out.

453
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,790
- Really?
- The fact of the matter is

454
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:35,127
women aren't really attracted
to wealth and power.

455
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:37,838
- They're not?
- No, of course not.

456
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,633
They couldn't give
a fig for all that rubbish.

457
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,761
What you need to figure out
is what she does want in a man.

458
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,763
How do I find that out?

459
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,348
Easy.

460
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:58,567
I'm not with her!

461
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,280
Where are we?

462
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,688
A place you never
would have seen without my help.

463
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,660
Welcome... Alison's bedroom.

464
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:11,455
We can't be in here.
This is breaking and entering.

465
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,457
I know.
It's fun, isn't it?

466
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,752
I'm sure we're gonna find the answer
somewhere around here.

467
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:19,672
What if Alison catches us?

468
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,132
Don't worry.
She won't be able to see you.

469
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,550
Besides,

470
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,636
she's in the shower.

471
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:26,804
Naked.

472
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:27,972
Right behind that door.

473
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,599
Go on, go ahead.
Take a peep.

474
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:31,850
No!

475
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,144
Oh, come on.
We both know you want to.

476
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,730
You must think that
I'm really perverted, don't you?

477
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:37,898
That's what you think.

478
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,386
You think I'm some sad,
desperate, twisted, pathetic loser.

479
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:41,527
Yes.

480
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:43,904
Well, in that case,
maybe I'll just take a quick look.

481
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,322
Focus, Elliot.

482
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,659
Remember, we're here to find out
what kind of man she wants.

483
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:49,952
How are we gonna do that?

484
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,705
Well, she keeps a journal.

485
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,374
And here it is!

486
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:58,669
Right, I should be able to find some
information in here that's useful.

487
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,462
Hey, that's private stuff.

488
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,339
Is it ever!
Listen to this.

489
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:05,676
"Last night was the most
incredible night of my life."

490
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:09,680
I never did find out any of the guys'
names, but I brought them here

491
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:12,725
"and all five banged me
like a Salvation Army drum."

492
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:13,892
What?

493
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,519
- Give me that!
- Just kidding.

494
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:16,895
I could have been a writer.

495
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:25,487
Hey, it's okay. She could bump
into you and she wouldn't feel it.

496
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,782
Now this is good.

497
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:33,120
"I meet many
attractive men who are interested in me"

498
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:35,205
and, while many of them
are handsome

499
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,207
or clever or very successful,

500
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,169
I find myself turning away
from them

501
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:44,465
and searching the horizon
for someone else.

502
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,092
I don't know who he is
or where I'll find him.

503
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:51,472
I only know
that he is a sensitive man.

504
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,725
He's a man who's in touch
with his emotions.

505
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:58,187
He's a man who's not afraid
to share his fears,

506
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,898
his disappointments, and his tears.

507
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,442
'Where are you,
my sensitive man?"'

508
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,121
Did you see that?

509
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,082
She passed right through me.

510
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,375
We were one person
for a split second.

511
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,252
Just like in "Ghost"!

512
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,588
Darling, I've got an earthquake
in eight minutes.

513
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,381
Any chance of making a wish here?

514
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,133
Yes.

515
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:32,304
I wish I were the most sensitive
man in the world.

516
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:34,389
Right. Okay.

517
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,557
Wait!

518
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:39,561
I wish I were the most emotionally
sensitive man in the world.

519
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:41,772
Damn, I was hoping
you wouldn't catch that.

520
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,941
I could have had a lot of fun.

521
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:45,651
And I want her to love me.

522
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:47,569
Oh... you know what?

523
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,947
I have a great feeling about this.

524
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:52,116
- You do?
- Yeah, but...

525
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,450
what do I know?

526
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,548
- Hey.
- I'm back, my love.

527
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,924
Where did you run off to?

528
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,801
I went to make a garland
of beach plums

529
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:14,263
to place atop your glorious head
like a crown.

530
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,350
But then I caught sight
of that sunset and...

531
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,018
I don't know.

532
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:23,313
Something stirred inside me
and I had to stop

533
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,107
and weep.

534
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,318
It's beautiful.

535
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,945
Yeah, it is.

536
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:34,199
There I go again.

537
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:36,618
- Tissue?
- No.

538
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:39,997
I never wipe my tears away.
I'm not ashamed of them.

539
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:41,832
I wear them proudly.

540
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,544
Like small, wet, salty
badges of emotional truth.

541
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:49,756
Elliot, there's something that
I think we should talk about.

542
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,845
We've been together for, what,
about three weeks now?

543
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,054
Three magical weeks.

544
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,557
Three magical weeks.

545
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:01,101
I don't think that I've ever met

546
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,686
a man who's been more in touch

547
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,730
- with his feelings.
- I love you.

548
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:06,690
So very much.

549
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,026
I love you, too.

550
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:15,699
Dudley! Peter!

551
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:18,744
I'm sorry, they're such little devils.

552
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:21,079
Come on, you naughty boys.
See you.

553
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:26,793
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

554
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,671
Do you need comforting
on any level?

555
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,215
No, no, I'm fine.

556
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,217
Have I done or said anything

557
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,886
to make you feel
less good about you?

558
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,554
No, no, I'm fine.

559
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,223
Would you like something to eat?

560
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,225
I made a Salade Nicoise

561
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,727
with dolphin-safe tuna.

562
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:46,063
Oh, wow.

563
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,029
What is it?

564
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:55,614
It's that sunset again.

565
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:58,367
And I worry about the dolphins.

566
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,744
I wrote a song about them.
Would you like to hear it?

567
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,746
Now? I...

568
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:14,800
♪ Swimming by the sandy shore ♪

569
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:18,053
♪ Dancing up among the waves ♪

570
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:20,514
♪ Dolphin, dolphin, I adore ♪

571
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:23,183
♪ Everything you are ♪

572
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:26,103
♪ You're so much more
than a fish to me ♪

573
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:29,147
♪ My playful friend
beneath the sea. ♪

574
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:35,487
- I have to stop.
- Good. I mean, oh, why?

575
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:37,197
Because I'm looking at you

576
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,491
and I'm seeing
all the beauty of the world

577
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,451
shining at me through your eyes.

578
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,120
Would you mind if I sketched you?

579
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:45,414
I didn't know you could draw.

580
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,624
I'm not an artist per Se.

581
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,794
Okay, Elliot, there's something
that I think I really have to say.

582
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:55,799
Elliot, that's amazing!

583
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,136
Compared to you,
it's nothing.

584
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:01,638
Compared to your smile

585
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,140
and the blush of your cheek

586
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:06,435
and the sound of your voice
as it floats on the evening breeze.

587
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,730
Compared to you,
that sunset's just...

588
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,485
when is that darn thing gonna set?

589
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,487
- Maybe we should go.
- No, wait!

590
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,948
There's so much
that I want to say to you,

591
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:22,159
but I just can't find the words.

592
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,202
I have an idea.

593
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,123
I would like to improvise
a sonnet about your hair.

594
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:33,170
How wonderful
my fair one's face...

595
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:39,259
Excuse me, fellas.

596
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,845
Might I ask you to take the horseplay

597
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,680
down to another part of the beach?

598
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,599
Eh... no.

599
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:55,025
You know,
rather than get confrontational,

600
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,361
why don't we all
just sit down together,

601
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,404
have some salad
with dolphin-safe tuna

602
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:02,115
and see if we can't start a dialogue.

603
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:05,994
You know, I had a feeling
that you were gonna...

604
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,622
Okay, guys.

605
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:11,041
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you

606
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,710
to respect the moment
that my woman friend

607
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:16,713
and I are sharing,
because it's a special celebration

608
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,715
of love and caring

609
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:22,386
and a unique spiritual
and emotional understanding.

610
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,597
Do you want to get a beer?

611
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,307
Sure.

612
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:30,560
Alison, excuse me, but I thought that
this was our time together.

613
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,528
It's just a beer.
I'll be back in two seconds.

614
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:34,731
Actually, my place is, like,
40 minutes from here.

615
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,274
That's fine.
Which way's your car?

616
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,735
- It's a van.
- Great.

617
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:42,280
Alison! I respect your uniqueness
and your individuality

618
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,116
and you're your own person.

619
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,284
If you want to go
with our new friends here

620
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,412
to get a drink,
I won't stand in your way.

621
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,747
Thanks, Elliot.
I knew you'd understand.

622
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,416
No, wait!
Don't go! Don't go!

623
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,335
I can't handle this kind of rejection.
Why don't you want to stay?

624
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,129
You want to know why, Elliot?

625
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,548
Because you're just too sensitive!

626
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,049
I'm about to go out of my mind!

627
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:04,261
It's been wonderful,
and God knows I love you,

628
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:06,388
but enough is enough!

629
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:07,848
I just want to be with a man

630
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,016
who'll ignore me
and take me for granted,

631
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,893
who's only pretending
to be interested

632
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,728
in who I am and what I think

633
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,439
so he can get into my pants.

634
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,315
That would be me.

635
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,234
Oh, thank you!

636
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:21,945
Let's get out of here.

637
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:23,989
Alison? Wait!

638
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:26,658
Alison!

639
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:29,327
I'll get into your pants!

640
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:50,056
Oh, Elliot, get out of there,
you silly boy.

641
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,893
Man, you are so bad!

642
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,186
Why, thank you.

643
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,353
Just admit it.

644
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:58,148
You're not very good at this whole
instant-travel thing, are you?

645
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:01,026
I'm sorry. Now then,
what were we talking about?

646
00:47:01,194 --> 00:47:02,777
Oh, your next wish, wasn't it?

647
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,654
Don't think I don't see
what you're doing.

648
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:08,450
I make wishes, and you think up
ways to ruin them!

649
00:47:08,618 --> 00:47:10,494
I ruin them?

650
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,829
How can you say that?

651
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:16,416
I'm not perfect, you know!
Do you think I enjoy this?

652
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:20,170
I'm stuck in this
horrible job for eternity,

653
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:22,297
everybody hates me,
I can't sleep,

654
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:24,065
and when I actually try to help someone,

655
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:25,653
they turn on me like
I'm supposed to be

656
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,053
God or something!

657
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:31,389
For your information,
my life is a living hell!

658
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:34,893
I work hard!
I try to look good for you!

659
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:38,438
You do look good.
You look very good.

660
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:41,191
I just wanted you to like me!

661
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,984
I do like you.

662
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,992
It's just I'm feeling
a little frustrated here.

663
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:48,406
Don't give up on me, Elliot.
I'm not giving up on you.

664
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,450
Nobody gets it totally right
right away.

665
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:52,953
You're doing great. Really.

666
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,248
- I am?
- Yeah. You are.

667
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,917
I'm so sorry your wish
didn't work out.

668
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:02,587
Friends?

669
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:04,506
Sure.

670
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:08,468
I'm sorry if I said anything
to upset you or make you feel bad.

671
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:11,346
And I'm gonna try to be
more sensitive next time.

672
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:13,265
Oh, I think you're
sensitive enough already.

673
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,267
- You think?
- Are you kidding?

674
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,726
You even went for me crying.

675
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:19,271
Hey! Were you faking me out?
Because...

676
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,314
I was 100% sincere.

677
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:24,234
It's not easy being
the Barbra Streisand of evil, you know.

678
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:28,280
What have we learned so far?

679
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,448
Well, let's see.

680
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:33,016
I'm starting to think women
really don't know what they want.

681
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,160
Amen!

682
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,830
They say they want sensitivity,
but you saw how fast she went

683
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,915
for those tough dudes on the beach?

684
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,500
Which tells you?

685
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:42,294
That...

686
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,963
well, it tells me that I want to be
really big and strong.

687
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:47,674
I want to have a great body.
Tall and, like,

688
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,302
Good. Go on.

689
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,845
- I want to be athletic.
- Check.

690
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:53,638
And I want to be rich, too.

691
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:57,475
For something that I like doing
and that people really like me for.

692
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,477
Great! This is getting
really specific.

693
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:02,480
Let's see...
big, strong, rich, athletic,

694
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:05,817
something you like,
lots of fans...

695
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,569
are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

696
00:49:07,737 --> 00:49:09,029
Oh, I hope so.

697
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,405
In the form of a wish?

698
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:12,407
I wish I could play
professional basketball!

699
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:15,702
Dennis Rodman!

700
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:20,081
- No!
- Just kidding!

701
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:21,750
Michael Jordan.

702
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:24,336
Yeah!

703
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:29,758
Three... two... one...

704
00:49:34,347 --> 00:49:37,724
The fans are going nuts here
at the Forum in Los Angeles.

705
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:40,185
The score, 135 to 85.

706
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:42,020
Elliot Richards
has totally dominated.

707
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:43,897
If you're just tuning in,
it's a shame

708
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:46,185
because you've missed
one of the greatest performances

709
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:47,525
in the history of sports.

710
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,361
Absolutely, Jerry.
Absolutely.

711
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,655
People say basketball caught fire

712
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,740
with the ascendry
of Michael Jordan.

713
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:56,785
But after what
we've seen here tonight,

714
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,204
a lot of people are gonna be saying,
"Michael who?"

715
00:49:59,372 --> 00:50:00,914
Right from the get-go,

716
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:03,375
the fans took a look
at Elliot Richards

717
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,959
and a few women fainted

718
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,087
and a few fellas,
well, I'd rather not say,

719
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,005
but they liked what they saw.

720
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,925
Absolutely.
He's a big fella and an imposing fella.

721
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:15,261
He's enormous.
He's listed at 7'6" in the program,

722
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,806
but I say he plays,
like you said, 11 feet tall.

723
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,683
No, I don't think
he's that big, Jerry.

724
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,686
No, I'm saying the game
he plays is

725
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,230
that of some Viking giant

726
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:28,608
with a basketball in one hand
and a club in the other

727
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:30,777
and standing 10, 11, 12 feet tall!

728
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:32,946
It's obvious that Elliot Richards

729
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:35,740
will control this game
from the tip-off.

730
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:37,158
Right from the get-go,

731
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:39,911
Elliot is a dominating force
in tonight's game.

732
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,623
He was "phi-slamma-jamma,"
rubbing stink all over him

733
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:46,835
with rib-tickling jumps
of double-vanilla funk.

734
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:50,296
Let's take a look.
Here's a pass worthy of John Elway.

735
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,716
For the dunk!
Just a beautiful play.

736
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:57,554
Here he is lining up for the 3,
and, Ricola, it's good.

737
00:50:57,722 --> 00:51:00,223
Here comes his patented,
over-the-shoulder,

738
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:01,766
no-look three-pointer.

739
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:03,560
And nothing but net.

740
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,606
They got the rhythm tonight.

741
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,317
They're in the zone.

742
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,403
Here he is soaring through the air

743
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:16,114
like a man on a flying trapezius.

744
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:19,701
Bam! That's what I'm talking about!

745
00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:22,120
Destroying the backboard
and the glass!

746
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:24,706
- This kid's an animal.
- Let's take another look.

747
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:25,874
And boom!

748
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,668
Humpty-hump, dump-dump!

749
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:32,464
I love this game, folks.
I sure enough do!

750
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:35,425
Elliot Richards spitting
glass at your ass!

751
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:38,595
Bob is courtside with
Elliot Richards now. Bob?

752
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:40,221
Thank you, Jerry and Dan.

753
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:42,670
Elliot, you must be one
very proud young man this evening.

754
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:45,727
Simply put, that was a staggeringly
dramatic display of athletic ability.

755
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:48,438
Well, you know,
you go out there

756
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:51,065
and you give 110%
and you want to play good.

757
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:54,652
You hope you play good.
I think we played pretty good tonight.

758
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:58,782
In sports terminology... and I
don't mean to sound contrary here...

759
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:02,368
the word "good" falls short
of encompassing the sheer virtuosity

760
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,829
of your performance this evening.

761
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:08,541
Um, well, you know,
there's no "I" in the word "team"

762
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:12,045
and this is a team effort,
and I want to say I'm proud

763
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:15,507
to be associated with
these fine individuals

764
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,967
that I have had
the pleasure of working with.

765
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:21,679
I would never want to dis your
teammates, but you realize that

766
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:25,642
you smashed Wilt Chamberlain's
record of 100 points in a game

767
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:28,186
set in Hershey, Pennsylvania,
all those years ago?

768
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:31,981
Oh, man, you just gotta play one game
at a time and give 110%.

769
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:35,652
You gotta show you want it more
than they do when the chips fall.

770
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,530
Thank you very much.
Back to you, Jerry and Dan.

771
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:41,449
All right!
Diablos!

772
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:43,743
Number one, yeah!

773
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,333
Elliot.
Hi.

774
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,335
Alison Gardner.

775
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:53,878
"The Sporting News."

776
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,465
It's nice to meet you, ma'am.

777
00:52:57,633 --> 00:53:00,385
God, I can't tell you how
thrilled I am to meet you.

778
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:03,012
I was wondering if there
was a possibility

779
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,598
if you might consider doing
something exclusive with me

780
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:07,267
for the magazine.

781
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:10,228
You know, maybe more intimate,
one-on-one.

782
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:12,146
Just the two of us.

783
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:16,401
Yeah, right, I'd kill you one-on-one!

784
00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:18,987
Shoot!

785
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:23,366
God, it's so exciting to be here.
I mean...

786
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:26,119
you must have an enormously huge

787
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:28,580
talent to do what you do.

788
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,415
Well, you know,

789
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:32,500
you go out there
and you just give 110%.

790
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,502
And...

791
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,297
you hope you play good.
And you want to play good.

792
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,549
I think we played pretty good.

793
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,634
God, you were incredible tonight.

794
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:45,638
Watching you... I just kept thinking
how unbelievably big

795
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:48,933
your ego must be
after a game like that.

796
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:51,227
Well, not that big, really.

797
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:52,770
I bet it's pretty big.

798
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:55,023
Well, it gets a little bit bigger.

799
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:58,985
It depends on how happy I am!

800
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,578
Want to go back to my place?
I'll show you my bottle cap collection.

801
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:12,248
Oh, God, that would...
that would be tremendous.

802
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:13,917
All right! Well...

803
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,794
I should...
I should get dressed.

804
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,546
I can't wait.

805
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:27,972
Oh, my God!

806
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:33,937
Hey! What the hell?

807
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,648
- God, there's this...
- Hey!

808
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:38,483
Damn!

809
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:40,109
Oh, heck!

810
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:43,112
Oh, God,
I remembered there's

811
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,198
this teeny, tiny thing to do.

812
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:47,241
- What's teeny?
- No, no.

813
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,661
- Just something I have to write.
- About me?

814
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:52,330
Yeah, just a little, short,
itty-bitty blurb

815
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:54,040
about tonight's game.

816
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,334
Well, can I see you
after the road trip?

817
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:59,170
I would love to,
but I'm working on

818
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:02,340
a really big, huge,
enormous story on the NFL,

819
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:05,343
so I probably won't have time.

820
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:07,220
Shoot, I understand.

821
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:10,348
- You gotta give 110%.
- Right.

822
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:12,392
- Stay within yourself.
- Hey, go, yeah.

823
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,688
Hey, um... thanks for your time.

824
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:19,023
So long.

825
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:21,192
Oh!

826
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,860
What the hell?!

827
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,904
Oh, damn the devil!

828
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:28,408
Damn the devil to hell!

829
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,201
Shoot! Darn it!

830
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:32,954
Where the heck did I put that?

831
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,629
5-5-5.

832
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:45,133
7-7-7.

833
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,022
Now what are you doing?

834
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,732
You seem so upset, Elliot.

835
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,059
Do you want me to give you
something to help you relax?

836
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,235
You bet I'm upset.

837
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:06,738
You gave me this little,
teeny-weeny winkie.

838
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,990
Well, that's easily fixed, you know.

839
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:10,533
Now then, let's see.

840
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:13,661
There's some M&M's for room 320.

841
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:15,580
Red Hots for 316.

842
00:56:15,748 --> 00:56:17,498
You're giving them candy?

843
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:20,209
Placebos.
They work as well as the real thing.

844
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,711
It's a scientific fact.

845
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,213
You can't give sick people Tic Tacs.

846
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,174
Sick people have
notoriously bad breath.

847
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,801
I'm performing
a public service here.

848
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:30,762
Now then, about your next wish.

849
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,724
All right, okay.

850
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:36,768
Well...

851
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,603
I want to be smart.

852
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:40,563
No, I want to be really smart.

853
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:43,608
I want to be able to talk good.
"Well."

854
00:56:43,776 --> 00:56:45,151
What's the word?

855
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:46,444
Articulate?

856
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:48,988
Articulate!
Yeah, I want to be articulate.

857
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:52,116
And I want to be witty
and sophisticated.

858
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:55,328
Charming. I want to know
everything about everything

859
00:56:55,496 --> 00:56:57,288
and I want to be popular.

860
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,998
I want to be good-looking.

861
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:00,446
No, no, make that great-looking!

862
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:04,170
And I want Alison to fall
head over heels in love with me.

863
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:05,588
Anything else?

864
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,548
Like what?

865
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:09,550
Like winkiewise?

866
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:12,220
Oh, right.

867
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:15,681
Yeah, well,

868
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,810
I want to be big.

869
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,020
Not like practical-joke big,

870
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,606
but, you know, sort of...

871
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,652
yeah, like that.
Is that clear?

872
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:30,446
Crystal. You just say "I wish"
and I'll fill in the rest.

873
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:35,243
I wish that
I was witty and articulate...

874
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,410
Blah, blah, blah.

875
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,621
You got it, smarty-pants.

876
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:41,999
Take two of these
and call me in the morning.

877
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,269
Oh! Elliot!

878
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:04,355
Oh, it is so wonderful
to see you, darling!

879
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:10,528
New York has been
so deadly dull without you.

880
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:11,737
Where have you been?

881
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,490
Out in the Hamptons, of course.
Up to my ears in my new book.

882
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:15,950
What, another one?

883
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:18,703
You've written four books
in three years.

884
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:21,497
- What's this one about?
- Oh, same old, same old.

885
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:24,417
A deconstruction of the neoromantic
period in art and literature

886
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:26,187
from the political
and economic perspective

887
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:28,523
of the Industrial Revolution
in France, England, and Germany.

888
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:30,506
I can't imagine who reads this stuff!

889
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:34,510
Well, Elliot,
the critics, apparently.

890
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:36,637
It's already won the Pulitzer Prize

891
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:38,556
and it hasn't
even been published yet.

892
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:41,142
Like they say,
Dr. Ngegitigegitibaba,

893
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:45,146
a Pulitzer Prize
and $3.50 will get you a caffe latte.

894
00:58:45,314 --> 00:58:46,898
So modest.

895
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,900
Darling,
you really should get around.

896
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,569
Everyone's dying to see you.
Mingle.

897
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,952
Darling, you look fabulous.
Vassily Mishka?

898
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,747
What a charming man.
Who is that?

899
00:59:02,915 --> 00:59:04,081
Oh, that's Elliot Richards.

900
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,417
He's a very successful writer.

901
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:10,254
He's a very successful everything,
as a matter of fact.

902
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:12,340
That's Elliot Richards?

903
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:15,134
Oh, I've read all his books.
He's brilliant.

904
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:17,094
I had no idea he was so handsome.

905
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:19,263
Why don't you go and talk to him?

906
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:23,142
- I couldn't. What would I say?
- Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

907
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:26,395
Just let him do all the talking.

908
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,439
It's a common misapprehension

909
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,524
that the word "gin"
comes from the city Geneva.

910
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:34,695
But the word "geneva," small "g,"
is a corruption of genievre,

911
00:59:34,863 --> 00:59:36,781
which is French for "juniper,"

912
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:40,076
the wonderful berry that flavors
this miraculous libation.

913
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,789
Speaking of miraculous.

914
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:47,208
I'm Elliot Richards.
How do you do?

915
00:59:47,376 --> 00:59:48,960
I know who you are.

916
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:51,545
I'm Alison Gardner.

917
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,674
I just had to tell you
how much I loved your novel

918
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,133
"Always Toujours."

919
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:59,387
Well, I was just trying
to make a simple point, really.

920
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:02,473
Every time I've reread
Camus and Sartre,

921
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:03,891
I kept thinking to myself,

922
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:06,477
"Why does the existential dilemma

923
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:09,647
- "have to be so damned bleak?"
- Yes.

924
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:11,691
Yes, we're alone in the universe.

925
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,318
Yes, life is meaningless,
death is inevitable.

926
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:16,487
But is that necessarily
so depressing?

927
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:19,657
I couldn't agree more.

928
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:22,410
Don't you think
secular humanism is yummy?

929
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,161
Oh, delish.

930
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:34,171
My, my.

931
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:36,841
They say alcohol is a disinhibitor,

932
01:00:37,009 --> 01:00:38,676
and it's working very well on me.

933
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:40,386
Me, too.

934
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:45,391
What an exquisite feeling.

935
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,977
Every cell in my body just...

936
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:50,646
wants to reach out
and touch someone.

937
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:53,983
Yes, it's incredible, isn't it?

938
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:59,113
The physiology of touch.

939
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:01,157
Just below your epidermis,

940
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:04,910
concentrated in your fingertips,

941
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:08,205
palms of your hands,

942
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:11,000
soles of your feet,

943
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:13,044
clitoris,

944
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:15,713
nipples, penis,

945
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:16,922
lips,

946
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,216
tongue.

947
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:22,595
Thousands of tiny little
Meissner's corpuscles

948
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:26,307
all deliciously sensitive
to even the slightest caress,

949
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:29,602
sending all those tiny little
endorphin-producing

950
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:33,856
pleasure messages
to the hypothalamus...

951
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:36,901
the primitive brain.

952
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:40,404
I'm tingling all over.

953
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:43,741
Do you know the largest organ
in the human body?

954
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:49,955
- I can guess.
- You'd be wrong.

955
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:52,833
It's your integumentary system.

956
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:57,213
Your creamy,

957
01:01:57,381 --> 01:01:59,757
soft,

958
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:04,387
and completely desirable skin.

959
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:08,015
- Can we go to your place?
- For something more?

960
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:17,274
Oh, this is so perfect!

961
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:20,236
Everything here
absolutely screams

962
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:23,114
Elliot Richards.

963
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,908
Actually, most of the screaming

964
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:28,119
takes place...

965
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:31,455
in the bedroom.

966
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:46,929
What the hell is going on, Mary?

967
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:49,056
- Who are you?
- Don't play games with me,

968
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:50,975
Mr. Richards.
I'm in no mood.

969
01:02:51,143 --> 01:02:54,645
I've been out of my mind all night.

970
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:57,731
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

971
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,650
Who's your little friend?

972
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:02,069
Maybe I should be running along.

973
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:04,488
Wait. This is a mistake.
I'm not gay.

974
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:08,451
Oh, really?
And I'm Tony Danza.

975
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,244
Honestly, I swear it. I'm not.

976
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:11,662
Well, then tell me,

977
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:14,665
who was in the Broadway cast
of "The Pajama Game"?

978
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:17,626
Janis Paige, John Raitt,
Eddie Foy, Jr...

979
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,170
I assume
you mean the original cast

980
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:22,089
because there was a revival
in 1973 with Hal Linden...

981
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:24,175
I am gay!

982
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:25,634
I rest my case.

983
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,471
Wait. I can prove to you
that I am not gay.

984
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:29,638
Kiss me.

985
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,850
Oh! This is just sad.

986
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:34,852
Will you shut up, bitch?

987
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:37,688
Please, Alison,
let me kiss you.

988
01:03:37,856 --> 01:03:40,691
Remember the champagne,
the corpuscles?

989
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:43,611
All right, Elliot, kiss me.

990
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:55,706
I'm gay.

991
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:59,043
- Well, thanks for dropping by.
- Good night.

992
01:03:59,211 --> 01:04:00,878
Buh-bye.

993
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:04,423
You've been drinking again,
haven't you?

994
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:06,217
This is just like the night

995
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:08,886
you had all those
Brandy Alexanders

996
01:04:09,054 --> 01:04:10,721
and ran up and down Fire Island

997
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:13,849
with your cute little Speedos,
singing "Evergreen" at the top...

998
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:19,021
And so the cow
was returned to its rightful owner.

999
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:20,648
Okay, boys,

1000
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,067
tonight's homework.
Algebra.

1001
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:26,028
Xn + Yn = Zn.

1002
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:29,490
Well, you're never
gonna use that, are you?

1003
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:34,078
Imperialism and the First World War.

1004
01:04:34,246 --> 01:04:38,332
What was done is done.
No point thinking about it now.

1005
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,376
German, French, Spanish.

1006
01:04:40,544 --> 01:04:43,963
Ja, ja, oui, oui, sí, sí.
It's nonsense.

1007
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,506
Everyone speaks English anyway.

1008
01:04:45,674 --> 01:04:48,300
And if they don't,
they ought to.

1009
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:50,594
So, no homework tonight.

1010
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,598
But I want you to watch
a lot of television,

1011
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:56,517
don't neglect your video games,

1012
01:04:56,685 --> 01:04:57,912
and I'll see you in the morning.

1013
01:04:57,936 --> 01:05:01,397
Shall we say 10:00, 10:30?

1014
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:03,245
No point in getting up
too early, is there?

1015
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:11,949
Elliot, darling.

1016
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:15,119
What a lovely surprise!

1017
01:05:15,287 --> 01:05:16,954
I hope you had a pleasant evening.

1018
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:18,956
As if you didn't know.

1019
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:20,457
I'm sorry, darling.

1020
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,626
I know it must be
really frustrating for you.

1021
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:24,795
Maybe I can make it up
to you somehow.

1022
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:28,424
Yeah, you've been
a really big help so far.

1023
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:31,635
I know. I've been really
naughty, haven't I?

1024
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:34,305
Maybe a good spanking's in order.

1025
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:37,474
Is that all you think about?
Do you think everything is about sex?

1026
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,393
No, of course not.

1027
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:43,480
I mean, there's greed, gluttony,
sloth, anger, vanity, envy.

1028
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:46,525
No, there's also honesty
and hard work

1029
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:49,862
and caring about people
and doing good for somebody else.

1030
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:53,490
Oh, you're just a big Boy Scout,
aren't you?

1031
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:56,660
I find that incredibly appealing.

1032
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:59,413
No. All I've been doing
is thinking about myself.

1033
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:01,707
I could be doing all these
really important things

1034
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:03,000
to help other people.

1035
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:04,668
What about Alison?

1036
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:08,088
Oh, I don't know anymore.
You mess it up anyway.

1037
01:06:08,256 --> 01:06:10,633
I know that Alison's
not really like that.

1038
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,135
What exactly do you have in mind?

1039
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:16,722
I want to do something great
for mankind.

1040
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,682
I want to create a better world.

1041
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:22,353
I want to go down in history
for doing something really important

1042
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,772
and I want Alison
to take me really seriously

1043
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:26,148
and to treat me with respect.

1044
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:28,776
I sense a wish coming on.

1045
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:32,529
Yes!

1046
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:35,783
I wish

1047
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,702
that I was the President
of the United States.

1048
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,664
That is the noblest,

1049
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:44,249
most unselfish thing
I've ever heard.

1050
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,210
And it's a great way to meet girls.

1051
01:06:46,378 --> 01:06:49,004
Bless you, Elliot Richards,

1052
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:52,132
and Godspeed.

1053
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:58,347
Mr. President!

1054
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:00,057
Alison Gardner.

1055
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:02,726
We're so honored
to have you here, sir.

1056
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:11,402
No, no, no.

1057
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:15,864
The actors are beside themselves
with excitement.

1058
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,408
We're going to a play?

1059
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,159
I think you'll find it quite amusing.

1060
01:07:19,327 --> 01:07:22,037
It's called "Our American Cousin."

1061
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:24,892
You know, I think I've seen it.
As a matter of fact, I'm sure I have.

1062
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:26,917
I don't think you've seen it, sir.

1063
01:07:27,085 --> 01:07:30,504
- It's an entirely new play.
- Really? I think I know how it ends.

1064
01:07:30,672 --> 01:07:33,132
- Say, can we just go to a movie?
- A what?

1065
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:35,092
The president.

1066
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:46,145
You seem tense tonight,
Mr. President.

1067
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:49,148
Oh, well, you know,
I've had a lot on my mind,

1068
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:53,068
what with preserving the Union
and my wife going crazy and all.

1069
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:00,284
Can I help you find something,
Mr. President?

1070
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:02,828
Yeah, I'm looking for my pager.

1071
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:05,038
- Your what, sir?
- My pager.

1072
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:08,292
It's this little red plastic thingy.

1073
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:12,296
It looks kind of like a cell phone,
only smaller.

1074
01:08:12,464 --> 01:08:14,006
I'm sorry! Sorry!

1075
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,220
All right, no problem.

1076
01:08:20,388 --> 01:08:23,640
No problem! No problem!
No problem.

1077
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:27,770
- Sic semper tyrannis.
- Wait!

1078
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:31,398
Okay.

1079
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:49,416
You're late, Richards.

1080
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:52,503
Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.
It won't happen again.

1081
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:54,379
See that it doesn't.

1082
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,590
I don't think a person
with your extremely limited

1083
01:08:56,758 --> 01:08:59,384
personal-professional skills
can afford to push the envelope.

1084
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,887
Yes, sir.

1085
01:09:04,516 --> 01:09:06,016
Thank you, sir.

1086
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:15,609
Creep.

1087
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:20,322
So tell me, how was it?
I'm dying to know.

1088
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,199
What are you doing here?

1089
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,326
Just think of me
as a computer virus.

1090
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:26,870
I think of you as a plague.

1091
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:30,582
Now will you get off my screen?
I have work to do.

1092
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:34,044
Whoa, what's this whole
"get thee behind me" thing?

1093
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:36,338
We still have business here,
Mr. Richards.

1094
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:39,633
No, not now.
I told you, I've got work to do.

1095
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:41,468
And besides,
I've only got two wishes left

1096
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:43,596
- and I don't want to screw them up.
- Correction.

1097
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:44,930
You have one wish left.

1098
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:48,267
Nice try.

1099
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:52,145
- I've got two more coming.
- No. Count them, baby.

1100
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:55,899
- You were President of the US.
- Yeah, okay, one.

1101
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:58,110
You were a charming,
handsome, articulate,

1102
01:09:58,278 --> 01:09:59,903
celebrated author and raconteur.

1103
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:03,073
Yeah, and you turned me
into a flaming homosexual.

1104
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:05,284
- Professional basketball player.
- Three.

1105
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,452
The sensitive, caring,
artistic guy was four.

1106
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,162
And the Colombian drug lord was five.

1107
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:12,249
- That means I have two more coming.
- You forgot the Big Mac and Coke.

1108
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:15,752
- What? That wasn't a wish.
- What do you call it?

1109
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,964
You said, "I wish," and I got it
for you. Sounds like a wish to me.

1110
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:21,425
No! No, no, no, no.
That's not fair.

1111
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:24,094
Fair? Who do you think
you're talking to?

1112
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:27,264
I don't recall anybody
ever accusing me of being fair before.

1113
01:10:27,432 --> 01:10:29,558
- I think I'm insulted.
- What? You can't...

1114
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:31,560
no, this isn't right!
You can't do this!

1115
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:33,562
What are you gonna do?
Sue me?

1116
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:35,230
No! That's it!

1117
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:37,441
I've had it with you!

1118
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:38,775
The whole deal is off.

1119
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:40,611
Off!

1120
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:43,780
Shut up!

1121
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:00,297
Are you all right?

1122
01:11:02,634 --> 01:11:03,800
Not really.

1123
01:11:06,721 --> 01:11:08,347
I need to talk to God.

1124
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:10,390
Well, that's the power of prayer.

1125
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:12,976
Just say what's in your heart
and He hears.

1126
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:14,478
No, you don't understand.

1127
01:11:14,646 --> 01:11:17,230
I really need to talk to Him.

1128
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:19,524
Now. It's urgent.

1129
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:22,235
Is it something you can tell me?

1130
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:25,822
No, it's personal.

1131
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:28,700
There's nothing you could say
that I wouldn't understand.

1132
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:30,994
Um...

1133
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:33,288
Why don't you just try me?

1134
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:35,165
Okay, a few days ago,

1135
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:37,334
I sold my soul to the devil
for seven wishes.

1136
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:39,982
I've already had five of them,
but the devil says I've had six.

1137
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:41,846
But I'm not counting
the Big Mac and the Coke,

1138
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:44,758
and she is and I don't think
that's fair, do you?

1139
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:50,180
This is so unnecessary.

1140
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:53,225
- You're coming downtown.
- The devil gypped me for a burger!

1141
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:55,268
Tell your story to the sergeant.

1142
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:57,813
So do you have a copy
of this contract?

1143
01:11:57,981 --> 01:12:00,315
No, I told you, she keeps it
in her office.

1144
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:03,819
- At this nightclub in Oakland.
- Yes, at a nightclub

1145
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:05,506
and, no, I can't tell you where it is.

1146
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:07,489
Because you promised
the devil you wouldn't?

1147
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,533
No, because she drove.
That's why.

1148
01:12:09,701 --> 01:12:12,828
Right.
In a Lamborghini Diablo.

1149
01:12:12,996 --> 01:12:15,706
- Look, Officer.
- Sergeant.

1150
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:18,083
Sergeant, I know my rights.

1151
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:20,043
I don't have to talk to you
without a lawyer.

1152
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:22,129
So you either book me
or you let me go.

1153
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:24,047
Oh, gee, are those my choices?

1154
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:26,425
Oh, what do I do, what do I do?

1155
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:29,511
I choose "book you."
Throw him in the lockup.

1156
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:30,759
Arraignment in the morning.

1157
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,764
- Drunk and disorderly.
- What?! Hey!

1158
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:36,059
- Recommending psychiatric evaluation.
- It's her! It's her, she's the devil!

1159
01:12:36,227 --> 01:12:39,688
One more word out of you and
I'll pop you one, you whacko bastard.

1160
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:41,732
Now move it.

1161
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:49,906
Spread them.

1162
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:53,702
There's no point fighting about this.

1163
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:57,748
You have to learn to accept
the inevitable.

1164
01:12:57,915 --> 01:12:59,750
We're all doomed anyway,

1165
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:02,377
so you might as well
just get with the program,

1166
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:05,797
wish your way out of here,
and move on.

1167
01:13:08,259 --> 01:13:11,219
I wasn't kidding
when I said I liked you.

1168
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:12,763
I do, Elliot.

1169
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:16,099
I think you have
massive potential.

1170
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:18,769
If you're looking
at an eternity in hell,

1171
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:21,021
let me tell you,

1172
01:13:21,189 --> 01:13:24,483
it wouldn't hurt
to have a friend like me.

1173
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:35,577
So you just think about that.
Give me a call when you're ready.

1174
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,921
She's a devil, that one.

1175
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:47,631
What?

1176
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:56,473
I said, she's a devil,
that lady cop.

1177
01:14:00,228 --> 01:14:02,521
Yeah, I guess.

1178
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,523
What you in for, brother?

1179
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:06,817
Eternity.

1180
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:09,528
Oh, that's a long time.

1181
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:12,864
You must have did
some really bad shit.

1182
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:14,658
Yeah.

1183
01:14:16,536 --> 01:14:18,120
I sold my soul.

1184
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,330
Hope you got something good for it.

1185
01:14:20,498 --> 01:14:22,791
As a matter of fact,
I got nothing for it.

1186
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:25,544
Well, that's a really bad deal,
if you ask me.

1187
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:29,631
Well, I'm not asking you.

1188
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:37,264
Doesn't really matter, though.

1189
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:40,392
- You can't sell your soul anyway.
- Oh, really?

1190
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,727
Why do you say that?

1191
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:45,313
It doesn't really belong to you
in the first place.

1192
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,190
No way, nohow.

1193
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:50,819
So who does it belong to?

1194
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:57,200
It belongs to God.

1195
01:14:57,368 --> 01:14:59,077
That universal spirit that animates

1196
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:02,122
and binds all things in existence.

1197
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:07,836
The devil gonna try to confuse you.
But that's her gig.

1198
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:11,214
But in the end, you'll see clear
to who and what you are

1199
01:15:11,382 --> 01:15:13,216
and what you're here to do.

1200
01:15:13,384 --> 01:15:15,844
Now, you're gonna make
some mistakes along the way,

1201
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:17,220
everybody does,

1202
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:20,765
but if you just open up your heart
and open up your mind,

1203
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:23,894
you'll get it.

1204
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:27,397
Who are you?

1205
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:32,736
Just a friend, brother.

1206
01:15:32,904 --> 01:15:34,571
Just a really good friend.

1207
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:42,555
Hey, baby!

1208
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:53,858
We love you, Elliot!

1209
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:56,194
Elliot, darling.

1210
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:58,530
So nice of you to drop by.

1211
01:16:58,698 --> 01:17:01,074
Come into my office.

1212
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:05,453
Oh, don't worry about them.
They're having a fabulous time.

1213
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,289
Pathetic, aren't they?

1214
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,499
Everybody wants to go
to the party,

1215
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:12,919
but nobody wants
to pay the piper.

1216
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,879
- Are you...?
- Don't get too excited.

1217
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:17,882
It's just a Halloween costume.

1218
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:20,885
Anyway, Elliot, my darling,
have you thought of your last wish?

1219
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:22,762
No.

1220
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:25,492
Well, I hate to put a big rush on this,
but there is a time limit.

1221
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:26,683
Read your contract.

1222
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:38,570
I really don't want another wish.

1223
01:17:38,738 --> 01:17:40,697
That's funny.

1224
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:42,240
Do you think
this halo's too much?

1225
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:46,077
No. I really don't want it.

1226
01:17:47,872 --> 01:17:50,582
What do you mean,
you don't want it?

1227
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:52,417
You get seven wishes.

1228
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:54,627
There's nothing I want.

1229
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:59,841
Well, there are things that I want,
but nothing that you can give me.

1230
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:03,053
What is that supposed to mean?

1231
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:05,472
Well...

1232
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:07,849
last night,
when I was lying in jail,

1233
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:09,059
I was talking to this guy

1234
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:12,020
and I realized that wishing
just doesn't work.

1235
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:14,230
All my life I wished
to be better-looking,

1236
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:17,275
richer, successful, talented, whatever.

1237
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:19,629
I always thought it'd be great
if someone could just wave

1238
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:21,738
a magic wand
and make that happen.

1239
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:24,866
Well, I realized that
it just doesn't work by magic.

1240
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:27,702
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1241
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:31,581
And I've been
starting to think that

1242
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:35,085
it really isn't that important
how far we go in life anyway.

1243
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:37,295
It's how we get there
that really matters.

1244
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:39,005
Oh.

1245
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:42,759
You know,
that is so inspiring.

1246
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:45,762
So it's okay?

1247
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:49,099
Well, no, Elliot.
I'm afraid it's not okay.

1248
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:50,517
A deal's a deal.

1249
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:53,061
You get one more wish,
and I get your soul.

1250
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:55,063
So let's just get on with it,
shall we?

1251
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:58,900
- I'm not gonna do it.
- Oh, really?

1252
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:01,611
Before you get all hinky,
I should warn you.

1253
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:03,947
I'm not all peaches and cream,
you know.

1254
01:19:04,115 --> 01:19:07,826
I do have a darker side
and, believe me, it's not pretty.

1255
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:10,745
Now you can go easy,
or you can go hard,

1256
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:13,915
but one way or another,
I will get your soul.

1257
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:15,750
I'm not gonna do it.

1258
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:19,129
There's nothing that you can say
or do that will make me.

1259
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:21,047
Oh, I think you'll change your mind.

1260
01:19:21,215 --> 01:19:23,716
I'm just gonna slip into
something a little more terrifying.

1261
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:25,135
See you in hell!

1262
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:36,479
Wait, wait, wait!
Just wait a minute!

1263
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:40,066
Wait!

1264
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,988
Now listen to me,
you disgusting little maggot!

1265
01:19:45,156 --> 01:19:46,865
This is your last chance

1266
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:49,367
before the big weenie roast!

1267
01:19:49,535 --> 01:19:52,662
Make a wish or forever burn in hell!

1268
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:55,707
Okay! Okay!

1269
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:57,834
I wish...

1270
01:19:58,002 --> 01:20:00,336
I wish that Alison has a happy life.

1271
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:02,672
Oh, God.

1272
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:30,074
Is this heaven?

1273
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:32,535
Heaven?
God, no, it's the courthouse.

1274
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:34,704
I'm just meeting
a couple of lawyers for lunch.

1275
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:36,748
Clients of mine.
Come on.

1276
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:41,544
Wait, what happened
to the whole,

1277
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:43,796
you know, fire

1278
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:48,092
- and the big, horny guy with...
- Oh, just a few special effects.

1279
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,720
Sort of the Universal Studios
tour of evil.

1280
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:54,599
It normally works pretty well,
but evidently you weren't going for it.

1281
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:56,601
Your last wish
was a deal-breaker.

1282
01:20:56,769 --> 01:20:59,771
- What?
- Nobody ever reads the contract.

1283
01:20:59,939 --> 01:21:02,899
Article 147, paragraph 9, section 3:

1284
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:04,692
Selfless acts of redemption.

1285
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,069
Huh?

1286
01:21:06,237 --> 01:21:09,113
Basically, it says,
"If you commit one truly benevolent act,

1287
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:10,573
it voids the contract."

1288
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:12,534
So I get to keep my soul?

1289
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:15,161
Yes, you get to keep your soul.

1290
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:18,331
Yes!

1291
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:24,295
Yes! I get to keep my soul!

1292
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:33,221
On November 16th, I'll have been
doing this for 6,000 years

1293
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:36,057
and you're the first person
to give away one of their wishes.

1294
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:37,825
I hope it's not
the beginning of a trend.

1295
01:21:37,935 --> 01:21:40,436
- You're not gonna tell anyone, are you?
- No, no, I promise.

1296
01:21:40,604 --> 01:21:42,689
Nope.

1297
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:47,443
I don't get it, though.
I mean, why are you being nice?

1298
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:50,905
Look, Elliot.
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

1299
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:52,865
The whole "good and evil" thing...

1300
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:54,909
you know, Him and me.

1301
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:57,245
It really comes down to you.

1302
01:21:57,413 --> 01:21:59,455
You don't have to look hard
for heaven and hell.

1303
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:02,292
They're right here on Earth.

1304
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:04,711
You make the choice.

1305
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:06,421
And I guess you just made yours.

1306
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:08,464
So I can go now?

1307
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:10,883
Unless you want another
seven wishes.

1308
01:22:12,303 --> 01:22:14,762
- No, thanks.
- Didn't think so.

1309
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:18,182
I really liked you, you know.

1310
01:22:20,144 --> 01:22:23,187
Well, to tell you the truth,

1311
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:25,189
you've been the best friend
I've ever had.

1312
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:27,650
Oh, dear.
Don't go gushy on me now.

1313
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:29,485
Okay.

1314
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:33,489
Go on. Go.
You'll scare the fish away.

1315
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:54,802
Alison?

1316
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,347
- Hi.
- Hi.

1317
01:22:57,514 --> 01:22:58,556
Oh, uh...

1318
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:01,184
Elliot Richards.
We've met a couple times.

1319
01:23:01,352 --> 01:23:04,729
Yeah, I remember.
Hi, how are you?

1320
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:06,105
I'm great.

1321
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:08,358
I'm exaggerating.
I'm good.

1322
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:15,198
We've been working together here
for the last four years

1323
01:23:15,366 --> 01:23:17,700
and I've always noticed you

1324
01:23:17,868 --> 01:23:21,871
and thought that you looked
like a very interesting person.

1325
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:24,666
I don't know how interesting I am.

1326
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:28,586
Well, the truth is I don't know you
and you don't know me,

1327
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:31,547
and if we were
to get to know each other

1328
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:33,841
that there's a chance
that we just might hit it off.

1329
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:37,970
So I was wondering if you wanted
to go get a cup of coffee or...

1330
01:23:38,138 --> 01:23:41,474
That's really so nice of you.

1331
01:23:41,642 --> 01:23:43,267
I'm seeing someone.

1332
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:48,564
Well, of course you are.

1333
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:52,068
He's sure one lucky guy.

1334
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:56,406
Listen, if it ever doesn't
work out with him, then...

1335
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:00,563
- That's so nice of you.
- Really?

1336
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:02,537
- Yeah. Okay.
- Thanks a lot.

1337
01:24:02,705 --> 01:24:05,581
- I'll see you around.
- Okay, take care. Bye.

1338
01:24:08,627 --> 01:24:10,920
- Go. It's a joke.
- It's only 10 bucks.

1339
01:24:11,088 --> 01:24:14,090
- What's he gonna do?
- Right.

1340
01:24:14,258 --> 01:24:16,426
Hey, Elliot, fo-felliot, so-smelliot.

1341
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:18,761
What's up, dudester?
Yeah.

1342
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:20,729
What do you say we go down
to the club tonight

1343
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:23,808
and pick up some chickette?

1344
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:27,770
Nice talking to you, Bob.

1345
01:25:02,473 --> 01:25:03,848
- Hey.
- New neighbors?

1346
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:05,308
Guess so.

1347
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:10,980
Hi. Oh.

1348
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:13,691
Hi. You must be the boy next door.

1349
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:15,651
Do you want to give me a hand?

1350
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:19,822
Habla English?
Spracht English?

1351
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:22,450
Parlez-vous "Americiano"?

1352
01:25:24,995 --> 01:25:28,664
- Hi, I'm Elliot Richards.
- Hey. Nicole Delarusso.

1353
01:25:28,832 --> 01:25:31,667
Don't call me Nicky, though.
Everyone always calls me Nicky.

1354
01:25:31,835 --> 01:25:34,337
It starts as Nicole,
then becomes Nicky, then Nick,

1355
01:25:34,505 --> 01:25:37,507
then Ni, then just "Nn."
People just call me "Nn."

1356
01:25:37,674 --> 01:25:39,050
I'm cracking myself up here.

1357
01:25:39,218 --> 01:25:41,344
- You want to give me a hand?
- Yes, I do.

1358
01:25:41,512 --> 01:25:43,971
- Okay.
- Oh, wow.

1359
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:45,515
You got the new Ingebritzens!

1360
01:25:45,682 --> 01:25:48,059
- Yeah, they're the best!
- They're the best!

1361
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:53,981
I'd be happy to hook
these up for you

1362
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:57,527
so you could have some music,
if you wanted, while you're unpacking.

1363
01:25:57,694 --> 01:26:00,571
I could make us dinner...
that way you won't have to cook.

1364
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:02,657
Yeah, right.
Me, cook?

1365
01:26:02,825 --> 01:26:04,200
Thank you.

1366
01:26:04,368 --> 01:26:07,745
Say, Nicole, you wouldn't happen
to have a sister, would you?

1367
01:26:07,913 --> 01:26:10,665
No sisters,
but I've got a lot of brothers, though.
