2
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:24,957
What are you doing?

3
00:00:25,124 --> 00:00:26,540
Can't you guess?

4
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,165
- I'm off.
- So soon?

5
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:32,498
"A man's at his best properly dressed."
It rhymes!

6
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,540
Here we go again.

7
00:00:35,874 --> 00:00:37,582
Come here.

8
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,248
Don't open the curtains.

9
00:00:55,374 --> 00:00:57,707
You were more affectionate last night.

10
00:00:57,874 --> 00:00:59,290
I was?

11
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:00,832
Very affectionate.

12
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:04,123
I remember nothing.
You must have been dreaming.

13
00:01:04,874 --> 00:01:07,582
We were both wide awake, and you know it.

14
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:10,332
Then I yielded to temptation.

15
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:12,415
It's the last time.

16
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:13,832
It is?

17
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:16,998
As of today, I'm on the road to chastity.

18
00:01:17,499 --> 00:01:20,665
Come now. I liked you better last night.

19
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,582
Last night was last night!

20
00:01:45,874 --> 00:01:50,832
LOVE ON THE RUN

21
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,623
Here's breakfast.

22
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:22,290
No time. I'll get fired.

23
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,873
Serves you right.
If you kept a few shirts here,

24
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,790
you'd save a whole hour.

25
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:32,165
- I also need a razor.
- Use mine.

26
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,123
I like my own razor.

27
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,623
What do you need a razor for?

28
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,165
Don't tell me. I'd rather not know.

29
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:47,373
A normal man, if you know what I mean,

30
00:04:47,874 --> 00:04:52,582
who sleeps with a woman,
who enjoys sleeping with him. . .

31
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:56,332
If this normal man
brought his razor and his clothes along,

32
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:59,248
they'd save a fortune in rent!

33
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,373
Many perfectly normal people

34
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,998
are creatures of habit.

35
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,540
Some are maniacs!

36
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,082
You're an old maniac, very old !

37
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,165
True, I'm old. But the elderly

38
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,832
have wisdom.

39
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,748
Your friend's watch. . .

40
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,248
You fixed it?

41
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,998
It needs a real watchmaker.

42
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,207
Digital watches are beyond me.

43
00:05:30,374 --> 00:05:31,665
Never mind.

44
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,332
I've got a present for you.

45
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,623
Léautaud's Diaries!

46
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:46,498
You found all 1 9 volumes?

47
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:50,582
He had nothing but problems with women.

48
00:05:51,624 --> 00:05:52,998
Poor Léautaud !

49
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:57,123
I'll tell you why.

50
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,707
He wanted to make love to his mother.

51
00:05:59,874 --> 00:06:03,457
She didn't mind, but nothing ever happened.

52
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:07,582
Anyway, thanks for his diaries.

53
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:09,207
You're nicer than I thought.

54
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,707
May I put my hand there?

55
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,165
If you promise to keep it there.

56
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:29,207
I switched vacations with Emmanuel.

57
00:06:29,374 --> 00:06:30,957
We can leave on July 31 .

58
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,832
So close the shop. We'll take off together.

59
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:34,998
To the country.

60
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,248
We'll drink warm milk, fresh from the cow!

61
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,082
Yuck!

62
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,790
My friend, Zenaida,

63
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:50,832
has invited us

64
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:54,623
to her housewarming.
I said we'd go. Is that okay?

65
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:58,040
Sure, with pleasure! See you tonight.

66
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,707
Your phone's been busy for an hour!

67
00:07:43,874 --> 00:07:45,957
I know. What is it?

68
00:07:46,124 --> 00:07:48,165
You crazy? Have you forgotten?

69
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,373
Good God!

70
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,748
Our divorce decree.
We must sign it in an hour.

71
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,582
- Hurry!
- I'm shaving.

72
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:56,415
Come unshaven.

73
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,873
No, I'll pick you up in a cab.

74
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,248
Alphonse wants a word,

75
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,290
but keep it short.

76
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:05,665
Hey, Dad?

77
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,165
Can you take me to the station
for our class trip?

78
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,415
What time?

79
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,498
I don't know. Here's Mom.

80
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,165
He must be there by 7 p.m.

81
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,498
I can't take him. I'm working.

82
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,498
I'm going to a party.

83
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,332
Cancel it. Alphonse needs you.

84
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,248
Okay. I'll be there.

85
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:36,248
I've got two seats for the Shapiro concert.

86
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,998
Want to come?

87
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:41,457
I'm busy. Do you want Paul Simon?
If not, I'll put him away!

88
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:43,415
First, I want to listen.

89
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,498
In the booth. What a creep!

90
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:57,707
I'm sorry, no time to explain.

91
00:08:58,249 --> 00:08:59,873
I can't go to the party tonight.

92
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,957
We can get there late.

93
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,207
I can't make it.

94
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,665
Why? Stop panting !

95
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,832
I can't explain now.

96
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:11,665
Someone's waiting for me.

97
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,540
I'll call you from the print shop.

98
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:21,082
How could you forget our divorce?

99
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,665
No one would believe it.

100
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,332
The incredible is often true.

101
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:30,082
I bet you've forgotten our wedding date.

102
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:32,540
February 26!

103
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,082
You actually remember!

104
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:36,332
It's Saint Nestor's Day.

105
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:38,207
Of course.

106
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,540
- Why the violin?
- For a lesson.

107
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,665
You're giving a lesson at this hour?

108
00:09:49,374 --> 00:09:51,040
So that's your violin !

109
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,707
It's so I can stay in a hotel tonight.

110
00:09:53,874 --> 00:09:56,457
Stay here. I'll sleep in the chair.

111
00:09:56,624 --> 00:09:58,332
You can have the bed.

112
00:09:58,499 --> 00:10:00,623
No, not in the same room as you !

113
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:04,415
Have it your way. Not in the same room.

114
00:10:20,874 --> 00:10:23,332
lmagine printing this in a newspaper.

115
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,707
Listen to this. It's about

116
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:29,665
the Common Market convention
in Brussels. It says,

117
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:33,957
"At 1 2 p.m. the delegates retired
to their rooms. Each man

118
00:10:34,124 --> 00:10:37,248
"was provided with a girl in the sack."

119
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,582
I don't believe it.

120
00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:42,707
It's true! lmagine reading that in Le Monde.

121
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:47,707
"Each man was provided
with a girl in the sack."

122
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,457
- You're lying.
- Read it yourself.

123
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,332
"The delegates retired to their rooms.

124
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:59,623
"Each man was provided
with a midnight snack." You idiot!

125
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:17,540
Mrs Christine Doinel is next.

126
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,540
What about me?

127
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,290
Must be a mistake.

128
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,665
No, it's normal procedure.

129
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:25,873
Come, hurry.

130
00:11:29,374 --> 00:11:31,207
We'll wait here.

131
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,248
I can't stay long.
I'm meeting some friends later.

132
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,748
Do you mind?

133
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,623
Not at all.

134
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:48,582
- You're sure now?
- I don't mind at all.

135
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,540
If you did, would you tell me?

136
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:54,373
No, I wouldn't. But I really don't mind.

137
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,915
Mr Doinel, to the Judge's Chambers.

138
00:12:22,874 --> 00:12:24,332
Please be seated.

139
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:27,040
I'm seeing you separately

140
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,873
to make sure you both reached your decision

141
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,332
freely and without coercion.

142
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:34,332
Since our first meeting

143
00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:36,832
three months ago,
you've had time to consider

144
00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:39,457
the consequences of your act.

145
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,873
Until very recently,

146
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:46,373
to get a divorce, you had to produce
abusive letters from your spouse.

147
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,415
What if they hadn't written any?

148
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,415
I'd make some up and they'd copy them.

149
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:04,748
Can you reach that bottle?

150
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,290
You've forgotten?

151
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,915
Mrs Doinel to the Judge's Chambers.

152
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:42,998
I'll now read the clauses of the Settlement.

153
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:45,248
"Names of the parties:

154
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,998
"Mrs Doinel reverts to her maiden
name of Christine Darbon."

155
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:53,123
At first, you wanted to keep
your married name

156
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,290
because of your son.

157
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,873
We've talked it over with Alphonse,
haven't we?

158
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,165
He understands.

159
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,957
He doesn't mind at all.

160
00:14:05,374 --> 00:14:08,665
"Child Custody and Support:

161
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,623
"By mutual agreement the mother
will have custody of the child.

162
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,707
"The father is granted visitation rights

163
00:14:13,874 --> 00:14:16,332
"and may provide lodging for a period

164
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:20,498
"not in excess of half the annual vacation.

165
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,457
"Mr Doinel will pay Mrs Doinel

166
00:14:22,624 --> 00:14:28,415
"as his share of child support
a monthly alimony of 900 francs

167
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:31,290
"until such time as the child
is self-supporting."

168
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,248
Please.

169
00:14:37,624 --> 00:14:40,373
I will now read you the full Decree.

170
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,623
If I ask you for a favour, will you do it?

171
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,207
That depends.

172
00:14:45,874 --> 00:14:46,873
Quibbling again !

173
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:49,082
Will you do it?

174
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:50,957
Try me.

175
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,998
Put your glasses on again.

176
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,082
"As judge of the Family Court

177
00:15:08,249 --> 00:15:10,998
"I hereby declare that

178
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,748
"Antoine Doinel and Christine Doinel,

179
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:18,040
"née Darbon, born in Dijon, March 1 2, 1 951

180
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:22,207
"upon their joint petition,
are granted a divorce.

181
00:15:22,374 --> 00:15:24,623
"The settlement stipulates that

182
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,040
"both parties will bear the costs.

183
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,873
"If they fail to agree on the terms

184
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,957
"said costs will be equally divided."

185
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:35,540
No signatures?

186
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,290
What's all this?

187
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,998
I knew it! The press!

188
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,748
You're the first divorce under the new law.

189
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:48,915
Don't go!

190
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,540
Pictures! Hope they'll give us a few.

191
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:52,998
Funny!

192
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,748
Let's make a good impression.

193
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,540
You don't say hello?

194
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,415
How are you?

195
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,165
- It's so nice to see you.
- You too.

196
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,915
See our debate on TV?

197
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,957
That prosecutor overdid it.

198
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,665
The law isn't so new.

199
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:20,457
It dates back to the Revolution.
Right, Antoine?

200
00:16:20,624 --> 00:16:21,623
Leave me out of it.

201
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:24,790
The lawyer assigned to the case.

202
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:27,957
I know that guy.

203
00:16:28,499 --> 00:16:29,915
He's Antoine Doinel.

204
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:34,207
I met him years ago, at a Youth Concert.

205
00:16:34,374 --> 00:16:37,165
I was impressed.
He had his own flat and a job

206
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,040
with a record company. Real independent!

207
00:16:41,874 --> 00:16:44,998
He's a client. Rather, his wife is.

208
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,957
They just got a divorce under the new law.

209
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:52,498
I can't believe it. Antoine divorced !

210
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:57,165
Does that call for
condolences or congratulations?

211
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:02,665
Napoleon used the law to dump Josephine.

212
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,873
Are you going to take
on the Draguignan case?

213
00:17:06,374 --> 00:17:08,915
My friends tell me it's a nasty business.

214
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,498
But I'm tempted.

215
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,207
Take your friends' advice. They're right.

216
00:17:13,374 --> 00:17:15,707
It's a messy case.

217
00:17:16,749 --> 00:17:18,832
Still, I'd like to see the whole file.

218
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:21,415
That's why I'm going
to Aix-en-Provence tonight.

219
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,915
Well then, good luck!

220
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,540
I'll need it.

221
00:17:26,499 --> 00:17:28,873
Always running. Hasn't changed a bit!

222
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:48,123
Watch out for your suit!

223
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,873
In your Sunday best. Been to a wedding?

224
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,873
No, not a wedding. In fact, just the opposite!

225
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,457
- Your digital watch.
- Did she fix it?

226
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,082
- She couldn't.
- Too bad.

227
00:18:05,249 --> 00:18:07,623
- What's this?
- A rush job.

228
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,748
I did half to help you out.

229
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,707
Here are the last pages.

230
00:18:12,874 --> 00:18:14,915
You're a real pal !

231
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,748
I'm fed up. Too many problems.

232
00:18:34,499 --> 00:18:37,123
What good is a divorce if you always wind up

233
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,498
with the same kind of girl?

234
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,373
I bet the new one's just like the old one.

235
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,623
You only fall for nice girls.

236
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,790
The truth of the matter is,

237
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,540
I don't just fall for the girl.

238
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,957
I fall for the whole family: father, mother. . .

239
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:54,415
I like girls with nice parents.

240
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,332
Is Sabine tall or short?

241
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:01,498
In between, about up to here.

242
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:05,582
I remember when
you only went out with tall girls.

243
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,332
Very tall.

244
00:19:07,499 --> 00:19:10,790
I liked them at least a head taller.

245
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,957
Does the name Doinel ring a bell?

246
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,873
Antoine Doinel.
His novel came out two years ago.

247
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,582
You wanted a Dalloz.

248
00:19:36,749 --> 00:19:39,248
I still do, but that's not the one.

249
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:43,123
I also want a novel written by Antoine Doinel.

250
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:46,165
One thing at a time. First, which Dalloz?

251
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,998
His book on child-murderers.

252
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:53,082
It's that case in Draguignan. I'm in a spot.

253
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,623
I see you couldn't care less!

254
00:19:58,624 --> 00:19:59,957
Listen, Colette.

255
00:20:01,624 --> 00:20:03,998
In here, you're just another customer.

256
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,457
Thanks!

257
00:20:05,624 --> 00:20:07,998
Well, to me, you're much more
than a salesman !

258
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,998
Don't I know it!

259
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:14,582
I wish you'd stop carrying on about nothing.

260
00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:16,873
It's for you, Mr Xavier.

261
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,957
Sabine. . .

262
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,582
I can't tonight. Is tomorrow all right?

263
00:20:28,124 --> 00:20:29,873
See you then, my dear Sabine.

264
00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:35,957
If I'm not mistaken,

265
00:20:36,124 --> 00:20:38,290
Sabine is a girl's name.

266
00:20:38,874 --> 00:20:40,832
That's right.

267
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:44,707
Well, I'm sorry to bother you
by buying books

268
00:20:44,874 --> 00:20:47,457
in your very own bookstore.

269
00:20:47,624 --> 00:20:49,082
Now I remember.

270
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,957
The title of that book had the word

271
00:20:52,124 --> 00:20:54,332
"Love" in it. Yes, I said "Love!"

272
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:57,707
Then try a second-hand bookstore.

273
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,748
Listen to me!

274
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,457
The titles I sell don't have the word "Love."

275
00:21:02,624 --> 00:21:04,707
He's incredible!

276
00:21:05,874 --> 00:21:07,582
What a bastard !

277
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:09,415
Love And Other Troubles.

278
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,207
That's it!

279
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,457
Let's see your bread.

280
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,623
You ate some.

281
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,748
Come over here.

282
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,498
Put that down.

283
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:34,998
Right or left?

284
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:37,582
The left, sir.

285
00:21:43,124 --> 00:21:44,748
How much do I owe you?

286
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,457
39 francs.

287
00:21:48,749 --> 00:21:52,623
Xavier's so handsome.
He looks like Napoleon.

288
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:58,248
I'm so glad to have this book.

289
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,082
I can read it tonight.

290
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:04,248
The train for Aix-en-Provence
leaving at 7:02 p.m. , platform 1 5

291
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,123
Gare de Lyon.

292
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:49,290
Stay there.

293
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:08,498
I'm at the station.

294
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:09,623
What for?

295
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:12,415
I'd forgotten a very important date.

296
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:14,082
I'll explain later.

297
00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:16,207
You promised to come tonight.

298
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:19,332
I didn't know about Alphonse's trip.

299
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:21,040
I'm with him now at the station.

300
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:24,290
I could have come. To meet your son.

301
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,457
I'm dying to.

302
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:26,915
lsn't it high time?

303
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:30,207
Not right now. It might upset him.

304
00:23:30,374 --> 00:23:32,415
You're so complicated.

305
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:35,832
Ask your wife, your ex-wife.

306
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,873
You know I lead an orderly life.

307
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,040
I can't change overnight.

308
00:23:40,124 --> 00:23:43,832
I'm fed up with your mania for secrecy.

309
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:46,582
Alphonse meets too many outsiders.

310
00:23:47,249 --> 00:23:49,290
"Outsiders." Thanks a lot!

311
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:52,498
If you take me for a hooker,

312
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,248
then pay me each time we make love.

313
00:23:55,124 --> 00:23:56,540
You're not being funny.

314
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:59,832
Look, maybe you can afford to waste time.

315
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:02,832
The train won't wait. Neither will my work.

316
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:05,623
I've got no time

317
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:08,623
to fool around on the phone.
I'm hanging up.

318
00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:36,123
That's your coach, I think.

319
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,957
Run, my son !

320
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:42,707
Be nice to little girls.

321
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,290
Give your daddy a kiss.

322
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,832
Hold on, Dad !

323
00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:52,248
I am.

324
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,165
Take care.

325
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,248
Which one is mine?

326
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,457
Number 51 .

327
00:25:02,874 --> 00:25:04,082
When does the train leave?

328
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:05,207
In six minutes.

329
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:06,332
Is there a diner?

330
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:08,165
It's up front.

331
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,748
When does it leave?

332
00:25:11,624 --> 00:25:13,290
Your train leaves very soon.

333
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:16,582
In exactly 1 5 minutes.

334
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,498
I bet that woman's a spy.

335
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:21,873
Your violin, Alphonse. Practise well.

336
00:25:22,624 --> 00:25:25,040
Practise to become a great musician.

337
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:26,207
And if I don't?

338
00:25:26,374 --> 00:25:28,915
If you don't practise,

339
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,707
you'll wind up a music critic.

340
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:32,665
Watch out!

341
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:33,998
It's leaving.

342
00:26:27,416 --> 00:26:31,790
I first saw Colette at a concert.
They were playing Berlioz.

343
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:35,332
She sat five rows ahead of me, near the aisle.

344
00:26:35,499 --> 00:26:36,707
I spotted her immediately.

345
00:27:10,249 --> 00:27:12,832
I knew her name and address.
We'd even spoken.

346
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:15,623
But I was nowhere. As I told my friend,

347
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:17,623
"I've goofed on everything.

348
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:20,290
"She's not even my type.

349
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:22,998
"She talks like a boy, treats me like a pal.

350
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:25,957
"When I'm being serious,
she just laughs at me.

351
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:30,457
"Yet, I freeze my ass off waiting at her door."

352
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:34,540
How do you know you're in love?

353
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:36,832
When you become self-destructive.

354
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:38,373
He may be right.

355
00:27:39,249 --> 00:27:42,540
We made a date for the following week.

356
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:43,707
But the next day...

357
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,873
Look who's here!

358
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:50,457
What's up?

359
00:27:50,624 --> 00:27:53,998
I've got two seats to the lecture
on electronic music.

360
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:57,207
I'm sorry. I've got homework this afternoon.

361
00:27:57,916 --> 00:27:59,207
How about a movie tonight?

362
00:27:59,374 --> 00:28:02,832
I can't. I must finish this work by tomorrow.

363
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:04,582
I see.

364
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:06,415
Can I come in?

365
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:08,665
No, some other time. So long.

366
00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:12,790
Her father looked austere

367
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:15,665
but I liked him at once.

368
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,582
You still have your parents?

369
00:28:17,749 --> 00:28:20,082
Yes, but I never see them.

370
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:21,873
We don't get along.

371
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:23,290
What a shame.

372
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:26,457
It must be hard on your mother.

373
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:28,665
I guess it's my fault.

374
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,623
I used to run away from home.

375
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:34,415
- Colette wouldn't dare!
- Wanna bet!

376
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:36,582
Well, for me, family. . .

377
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:37,832
Question:

378
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,915
Where is one
better off than with one's family?

379
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:42,915
Answer: Anywhere else!

380
00:28:44,374 --> 00:28:45,998
I read that in a book.

381
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:48,873
She's not like that.

382
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:50,415
Don't be too sure.

383
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:52,665
Can I have more wine?

384
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:55,123
Me, too.

385
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:12,873
Dear Antoine, Your love letter
is so eloquent.

386
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:14,998
It suggests a man of experience.

387
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:18,123
I'm going to hear Le Roux tonight.
Will you be there?

388
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:19,748
Thanks for the books.

389
00:29:20,624 --> 00:29:22,707
My mother says you look romantic,

390
00:29:22,874 --> 00:29:24,665
probably because of your long hair.

391
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:26,707
See you tonight. Colette.

392
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:29,748
Colette?

393
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:31,832
Yes, hello there.

394
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:33,498
My poor head.

395
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:36,665
Why didn't you show up? Were you sick?

396
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:38,082
I said I might come.

397
00:29:38,249 --> 00:29:40,707
But some friends took me to a party.

398
00:29:40,874 --> 00:29:44,623
Real nuts. We carried on all night long.

399
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:46,790
It was hilarious.

400
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:49,457
But after a while, it got to be too wild.

401
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,373
We wound up at, it must have been 5 a.m.

402
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,540
Can I come by later on?

403
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:57,123
If you like, but I may be out.

404
00:29:57,291 --> 00:30:00,832
We all said we'd try to meet again today.

405
00:30:02,374 --> 00:30:04,707
- See you later.
- You will if I'm in!

406
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:07,957
I vowed to banish Colette from my life.

407
00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:10,373
I stood by my decision

408
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:13,123
and refrained from contacting her.

409
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:17,165
He's got some nerve.

410
00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:22,582
Fate decided otherwise:
her family moved and now lived

411
00:30:22,749 --> 00:30:24,748
right across the street from me.

412
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:39,498
Christine was quite different
although she, too, was musical.

413
00:30:39,749 --> 00:30:42,832
She attended the Conservatory,
studied the violin.

414
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:45,832
I'd known her several months.

415
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:49,290
Seeing her behind a window
one day, I decided to marry her.

416
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:52,332
I called her "Peggy Proper."

417
00:30:52,499 --> 00:30:54,790
"Peggy" for her British reserve.

418
00:30:54,958 --> 00:30:57,665
"Proper" because she was.

419
00:31:00,374 --> 00:31:03,207
Christine was always nicer to me
than I was to her.

420
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:08,540
I forgot my handkerchief.
Can you lend me one?

421
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:10,165
I've only got Kleenex.

422
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:12,040
I never blow my nose in paper!

423
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:18,332
- Well, so long.
- Where's your violin?

424
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:20,123
I'm not giving a lesson.

425
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:21,290
What, then?

426
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:24,207
Do you always tell me where you go?

427
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:26,707
See you tonight.

428
00:31:28,374 --> 00:31:30,873
DRESSMAKER - GYNAECOLOGlST -
NOTARY PUBLlC

429
00:32:07,499 --> 00:32:10,957
Dinner is served.
A gentleman is waiting for you.

430
00:32:11,124 --> 00:32:12,290
Really?

431
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:15,748
Oh, yes, I'll be right there.

432
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:42,748
Xavier, my love, I knew you'd come.
I hoped you would.

433
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:47,040
Antoine, it's you ! I'm sorry.

434
00:32:47,249 --> 00:32:50,415
No, I'm sorry to disappoint you.

435
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:52,457
Never mind.

436
00:32:52,624 --> 00:32:54,248
I saw you at the station.

437
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:56,082
I never thought you'd be on this train.

438
00:32:56,249 --> 00:32:57,998
So good to see you.

439
00:32:58,333 --> 00:32:59,457
Same here.

440
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:01,832
I'm really glad. I've got so much to tell you.

441
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:04,748
Sit down.

442
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:12,832
A surprise, but a nice one!

443
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:15,915
What a strange day.

444
00:33:16,874 --> 00:33:18,415
I didn't mean to leave Paris.

445
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:19,498
Really?

446
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,123
But seeing you was a shock.

447
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:22,415
A shock?

448
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,165
An emotional shock. I had to see you.

449
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:27,248
The train was pulling out. I jumped on.

450
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:31,748
I don't even have a ticket!

451
00:33:32,374 --> 00:33:33,748
I can't believe it.

452
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:34,957
Colette,

453
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:37,457
I often think of you.

454
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:42,873
How long has it been?

455
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:44,082
Stop!

456
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:47,498
No figures, no dates. We don't need that!

457
00:33:48,374 --> 00:33:52,707
We're just two people happy to meet again.

458
00:33:52,874 --> 00:33:56,082
I've already spent time with you today.

459
00:33:57,499 --> 00:34:01,123
It's embarrassing.
That book is over two years old.

460
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:02,957
I've changed since.

461
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,832
Don't forget, it's fiction.

462
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:09,082
A bit autobiographical, but fiction.

463
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:10,790
You said it!

464
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:13,457
I just read that part about my family moving.

465
00:34:13,624 --> 00:34:15,123
Here's how it goes:

466
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:18,457
"I vowed to banish Colette

467
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:20,915
"from my life.

468
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:22,957
"I stood by my decision

469
00:34:23,124 --> 00:34:25,873
"and refrained from contacting her again."

470
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:27,082
Fair enough.

471
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:32,123
"Fate decided otherwise: her family moved

472
00:34:32,374 --> 00:34:35,207
"and now lived right across the street

473
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:36,540
"from me.

474
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:39,373
"I couldn't turn down their invitations

475
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:40,665
"without being rude."

476
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:44,332
Sharp and well written, but it's a lie.

477
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,123
A pack of lies.

478
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:47,790
You gave up your room

479
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:50,040
to move across the street from us.

480
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:53,123
My parents were so surprised that day

481
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,873
when we got home.

482
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:02,498
Do you see what I see?

483
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:03,748
It's Antoine!

484
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:06,207
What a fantastic coincidence!

485
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:08,582
What happened?

486
00:35:09,999 --> 00:35:11,665
Do you live here, now?

487
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:12,915
Yes, I do.

488
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:14,373
Since when?

489
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:15,915
This afternoon !

490
00:35:20,124 --> 00:35:22,040
- Can we come up?
- Sure.

491
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:37,290
He's all moved in !

492
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:49,207
Fantastic! Hot and cold running water!

493
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:52,915
You can see our windows.

494
00:35:54,499 --> 00:35:56,248
But the sun shines down on our side!

495
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:02,040
You're right.

496
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:04,998
But it worked better with the roles inverted.

497
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:06,082
You don't say.

498
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:08,498
And I merged several people

499
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,373
into one character.

500
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:12,748
I know all about creative devices.

501
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:16,957
But I'm right in assuming
the girl from the Youth Concerts

502
00:36:17,124 --> 00:36:19,873
is in fact me?

503
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:24,332
Let's get back to you.

504
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:26,123
Are you married?

505
00:36:26,749 --> 00:36:28,665
Yesterday, the answer was "yes."

506
00:36:29,124 --> 00:36:31,748
I was married five years.
We separated three years ago.

507
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:34,373
At least, for the first time.

508
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:37,873
Our repeated separations
were more turbulent

509
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:39,582
than our years together.

510
00:36:39,749 --> 00:36:42,915
An outsider can't presume to judge, but. . .

511
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:47,248
Did you really try to save your marriage?

512
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:49,373
No, on the contrary.

513
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,123
In writing my book,

514
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:54,748
the memories of my past
made me edgy, nasty.

515
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:59,248
Christine was no help.
She disapproved of my work.

516
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:02,748
So I started playing around

517
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:05,332
to make up for
what I'd missed before my marriage.

518
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:07,832
We had arguments every day.

519
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:10,123
They led to our first separation.

520
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:20,540
A taxi, please. 1 7, rue Decazes.

521
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:26,082
Six minutes? Thank you.

522
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:28,373
Going out?

523
00:37:28,541 --> 00:37:29,957
Yes I am.

524
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:32,790
But you can stay here with Alphonse.

525
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:35,373
- There's food.
- I'll walk you down.

526
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:39,040
Good night, be good !

527
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:44,915
Watch TV if you like.

528
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:47,540
Take care of him.

529
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:53,207
This Balthus is yours.

530
00:37:53,374 --> 00:37:56,165
I gave it to you.

531
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:58,165
It's yours!

532
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:11,957
Remember how you used to say,

533
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:16,040
"I'm taking my keys in case we fight!"

534
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:21,582
You're in good spirits.

535
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:22,748
Why not?

536
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:25,082
I know whenever you come to see the baby,

537
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:28,123
you expect me to give you hell. Right?

538
00:38:28,374 --> 00:38:29,623
Admit it!

539
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:31,290
Absolutely not.

540
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:33,915
You mustn't kiss me.

541
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:35,957
Oh? I thought. . .

542
00:38:36,124 --> 00:38:37,582
I just thought.

543
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:43,207
Let me go!

544
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:44,582
It was to help you.

545
00:38:44,749 --> 00:38:46,332
I don't need help!

546
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:50,040
You're so nasty tonight.
How can you be so nasty!

547
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:52,165
You want everything your way.

548
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:56,373
A kiss when you want it,
to be left alone when you want it.

549
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:58,207
I'm not at your disposal.

550
00:38:58,374 --> 00:38:59,373
Not any more.

551
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:00,707
Enough.

552
00:39:03,249 --> 00:39:05,123
I'm sorry I blew up.

553
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:09,748
- I understand you.
- Here we go again.

554
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:11,332
"I'm a bastard,

555
00:39:11,499 --> 00:39:13,332
"you're too good for me."

556
00:39:13,499 --> 00:39:14,540
I never pull that.

557
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,957
You have, 1 00 times!

558
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:19,207
Save it all for your novel !

559
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:23,540
Well, my novel's almost finished.

560
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:27,832
It's all I can think about.
That's why I'm so screwed up.

561
00:39:30,374 --> 00:39:33,332
Once it's done, we'll get along better.

562
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:43,373
Don't send me a copy. I won't read it.

563
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:49,165
I dislike the whole idea

564
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,373
of writing about one's youth
to smear one's parents.

565
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:53,623
I'm not smart, but I know this:

566
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:57,915
Writing to settle old scores isn't art!

567
00:39:58,624 --> 00:40:00,623
I've wondered about that.

568
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:03,332
That's what's bothering me.

569
00:40:04,249 --> 00:40:06,873
Do as you like, but leave me alone.

570
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:10,873
I've never had much pride.

571
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,623
I can tell you I still love you.

572
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:16,665
But I'd rather not see you.

573
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:20,498
When you visit the baby, I won't be home.

574
00:40:28,499 --> 00:40:29,623
Where's that cab?

575
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:31,957
They said six minutes.

576
00:40:33,916 --> 00:40:36,290
Anyway, I hope you're happier now.

577
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:38,707
I wouldn't say that.

578
00:40:38,874 --> 00:40:41,707
It's hopeless. She and I hardly talk any more.

579
00:40:41,874 --> 00:40:43,373
You can always smile.

580
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,998
That's all we do!

581
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:47,707
By evening, I've got lockjaw

582
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:49,748
from all that smiling !

583
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:52,832
Restaurants are hell. Between courses,

584
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:55,665
I'm expected to make small talk.

585
00:40:56,124 --> 00:40:57,540
I can't even eat!

586
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:59,332
It's awful.

587
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:02,498
I told her I was going away for three days.

588
00:41:02,666 --> 00:41:04,332
I don't envy you.

589
00:41:05,124 --> 00:41:07,540
Where are you going?

590
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:11,415
I don't know.

591
00:41:11,791 --> 00:41:13,123
Can I drop you off?

592
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:14,498
No, I'm okay.

593
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:16,415
Just a minute!

594
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:19,873
Do you want me to stay with you?

595
00:41:20,374 --> 00:41:22,373
We could go to a movie.

596
00:41:23,124 --> 00:41:25,873
No, I'll just walk around.

597
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:28,832
You're sweet.

598
00:41:33,874 --> 00:41:35,290
Kiss me.

599
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:46,165
You're my sister, my daughter, my mother. . .

600
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:48,623
I'd hoped to be your wife as well !

601
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:56,165
During one of our reconciliations

602
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:58,457
a newcomer joined us.

603
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:02,790
Liliane was half femme fatale, half tomboy.

604
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:04,498
She was the antithesis of Christine

605
00:42:04,666 --> 00:42:07,290
and all Christine aspired to be.

606
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,748
I've always wanted to play.

607
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:12,707
Shouldn't I buy my own violin?

608
00:42:12,874 --> 00:42:16,332
It's too soon. Just rent one.

609
00:42:16,499 --> 00:42:17,498
See you Saturday.

610
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:20,582
I'll tell you where to rent a violin.

611
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:22,123
Great. Goodbye.

612
00:42:28,208 --> 00:42:29,290
Spying !

613
00:42:29,374 --> 00:42:31,082
Who is that girl?

614
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:33,623
She has a lovely face.

615
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:38,082
Really lovely. She's my new pupil.

616
00:42:38,249 --> 00:42:40,457
Violin lessons at her age?

617
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:41,623
How old is she?

618
00:42:41,749 --> 00:42:43,790
I didn't ask to see her I. D.

619
00:42:44,374 --> 00:42:46,123
Anyway, I think it's great.

620
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:49,207
Her parents couldn't afford violin lessons.

621
00:42:49,374 --> 00:42:50,582
Poor thing.

622
00:42:50,749 --> 00:42:54,123
- Now, she can pay her own way.
- What does she do?

623
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:56,248
Children's books.

624
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:57,707
They're the hardest!

625
00:42:57,874 --> 00:43:00,123
She writes and illustrates them.

626
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:04,373
I showed her the drawings I did
for Alphonse.

627
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:07,873
She liked them. At least, she said she did.

628
00:43:09,374 --> 00:43:11,415
Not bad !

629
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:13,082
Looks like the knights of the Round Table.

630
00:43:13,249 --> 00:43:16,040
You're close. They were commissioned by

631
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:18,040
Eric Rohmer for his film.

632
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:19,373
Who did them?

633
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:20,915
We both did.

634
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:23,623
Liliane did the faces. I did the costumes.

635
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:26,415
Who's that dude? Lancelot of the Lake?

636
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:28,957
No, it's Perceval of Wales.

637
00:43:29,749 --> 00:43:33,873
They were inseparable.
Sometimes, Liliane slept over.

638
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:35,415
Alphonse had grown.

639
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:36,873
Did you sleep well?

640
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:39,540
Yes, dad. Hey, can you shut it?

641
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:40,790
Shut what?

642
00:43:40,916 --> 00:43:42,540
Shut your trap!

643
00:43:44,624 --> 00:43:46,415
Doing okay, Alphonse?

644
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,957
Hey, can you shut it?

645
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:50,332
Yes, of course.

646
00:43:50,499 --> 00:43:51,582
You can?

647
00:43:51,749 --> 00:43:53,040
I'll try and shut it.

648
00:43:53,124 --> 00:43:54,123
Shut what?

649
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:55,207
Shut your trap!

650
00:43:58,041 --> 00:43:59,748
Since her arrival,

651
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:02,540
I'd had no intimacy with Christine.

652
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:04,457
So I rented a summer house.

653
00:44:04,624 --> 00:44:06,457
And there she was again.

654
00:44:06,624 --> 00:44:08,957
One, two, three. . .

655
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:17,748
Now, left foot forward. . .

656
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:19,457
One and two. . .

657
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:21,873
Your hands like this.

658
00:44:23,916 --> 00:44:25,040
I'll never make it.

659
00:44:25,124 --> 00:44:27,123
You will. Let's try again.

660
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:31,915
It was as if they wanted
to exchange personalities.

661
00:44:34,791 --> 00:44:37,082
If Antoine knew,
we'd never hear the end of it.

662
00:44:37,416 --> 00:44:40,040
You know, he's reading Colette.

663
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:43,082
Her books on backstage life,
the CIaudine series.

664
00:44:43,249 --> 00:44:45,082
So he's got lesbians on the brain.

665
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:47,623
Know what he said to me?

666
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:49,498
He said,

667
00:44:49,874 --> 00:44:51,915
"Christine, I think

668
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:55,915
"Liliane has designs on you.

669
00:44:56,583 --> 00:45:00,415
"That girl thrives on perversity,

670
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:04,540
"you know what I mean?
If I were you, I'd be careful."

671
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,457
The old, familiar pattern.

672
00:45:13,624 --> 00:45:15,832
Husbands need breathing space.

673
00:45:15,999 --> 00:45:18,582
They leave, come back and leave again.

674
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:21,748
One day, they find the door bolted.

675
00:45:23,749 --> 00:45:26,040
I didn't mean to depress you.

676
00:45:26,874 --> 00:45:29,623
What will you do? I mean about your ticket?

677
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:32,207
Get off at the next stop.

678
00:45:33,499 --> 00:45:35,165
No stop until Lyon !

679
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:37,707
I don't know.

680
00:45:40,499 --> 00:45:43,998
Let's go back to my sleeper, okay?

681
00:45:44,249 --> 00:45:45,582
Come on.

682
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:03,665
Are you mad? He was all alone.

683
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:06,207
He nearly fell out.

684
00:46:06,374 --> 00:46:08,998
What kind of parents are you?

685
00:46:21,374 --> 00:46:23,040
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

686
00:46:49,249 --> 00:46:50,748
Can you open my sleeper?

687
00:46:59,374 --> 00:47:00,665
There you are.

688
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:02,998
- The other seemed nicer.
- But it's taken.

689
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:04,165
May I look?

690
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:05,498
If you wish.

691
00:47:20,249 --> 00:47:22,040
Very sorry.

692
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:25,373
Thanks, anyway.

693
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:55,165
I don't believe it.

694
00:47:58,416 --> 00:47:59,832
What a creep!

695
00:48:00,749 --> 00:48:02,415
Hand me a pillow.

696
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:11,498
You write well, Antoine.

697
00:48:11,666 --> 00:48:14,748
But you won't be a real writer

698
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:19,373
until you create a story
that is wholly fictional.

699
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:23,040
I've started it. Real fiction.
I've even got the title.

700
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:26,415
Remembrance of Things to Come.

701
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:33,040
It's a fine title, it's very good.

702
00:48:33,499 --> 00:48:34,665
What's it about?

703
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:36,582
It's the story of a guy

704
00:48:36,749 --> 00:48:40,082
who comes out of the toilet in the café.

705
00:48:40,249 --> 00:48:42,207
He wants to make a call,

706
00:48:42,624 --> 00:48:45,415
but someone is in the only phone booth.

707
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:49,248
Our hero can't help overhearing.

708
00:48:49,416 --> 00:48:50,832
"You're an egomaniac!"

709
00:48:50,999 --> 00:48:53,832
The guy's excited, in fact, angry.

710
00:48:54,083 --> 00:48:57,623
My hero gathers
he's breaking up with a woman.

711
00:48:57,791 --> 00:48:58,873
"Drop dead !"

712
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:03,998
At one point, the guy takes out a photograph,

713
00:49:04,166 --> 00:49:06,332
the picture of a woman,

714
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:08,707
and tears it to shreds.

715
00:49:08,999 --> 00:49:12,040
After throwing the pieces to the floor,

716
00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:14,665
he hangs up in a rage and storms out.

717
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:17,540
My hero, once the man has left,

718
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:20,332
goes into the booth,

719
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,540
picks up the pieces of the photograph.

720
00:49:23,499 --> 00:49:26,623
At home, he becomes
more and more fascinated

721
00:49:26,874 --> 00:49:30,665
as he pieces the puzzle together.

722
00:49:30,874 --> 00:49:33,998
On the back, the photographer's imprint

723
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:36,290
is the first lead in his investigation.

724
00:49:37,624 --> 00:49:41,082
I forgot. The moment he sees
her face on the picture,

725
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:44,915
he falls madly in love
with the unknown woman.

726
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:47,623
Go on, it's fascinating ! What happens?

727
00:49:47,791 --> 00:49:51,373
Patiently, craftily, obstinately,

728
00:49:51,541 --> 00:49:54,248
my hero tracks the girl down

729
00:49:54,416 --> 00:49:56,998
and arranges a chance meeting.

730
00:49:57,166 --> 00:50:01,498
He never tells her he loves her,
or how he found her.

731
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,290
Fantastic!

732
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:07,373
Wait. He's in love with her.

733
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:09,540
But does she love him?

734
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:12,540
That's where I'm stuck.

735
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:15,415
She'll probably respond to his love.

736
00:50:15,666 --> 00:50:18,915
But their affair is bound to wind up as usual.

737
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:22,748
Disappointment, arguments and a break-up.

738
00:50:22,999 --> 00:50:27,665
All the things I already
dealt with in my first book.

739
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:30,998
What a letdown !

740
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:32,540
Not that!

741
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:35,373
You have a strange concept of relationships.

742
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:39,498
All you care about is boy meets girl.

743
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:41,873
Once they're a couple,

744
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:44,540
for you it's all downhill. Try harder.

745
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,998
You must find something.

746
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:48,207
What is it?

747
00:50:55,416 --> 00:50:56,540
Don't move.

748
00:50:58,291 --> 00:51:00,457
I was asked to give you this.

749
00:51:00,874 --> 00:51:02,540
- Any reply?
- None.

750
00:51:12,791 --> 00:51:15,290
What are you doing? Get off!

751
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:16,915
Let go of it!

752
00:51:17,083 --> 00:51:18,248
Forgive me.

753
00:51:18,416 --> 00:51:22,207
I won't. You think you can make up
for everything by apologising !

754
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:25,165
You haven't changed, have you?

755
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,498
Neither have you.

756
00:51:28,958 --> 00:51:30,332
Now, I understand

757
00:51:30,499 --> 00:51:33,498
what compelled me to jump on this train.

758
00:51:36,041 --> 00:51:38,123
Let me kiss you.

759
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:43,498
No, I won't. Do you know why?

760
00:51:44,624 --> 00:51:46,832
It takes two to kiss!

761
00:51:46,999 --> 00:51:51,748
You haven't learned a thing from
what happened to us in the past.

762
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:56,707
Antoine, I liked you, but I didn't love you.

763
00:51:57,416 --> 00:51:59,873
You tried to badger me into loving you,

764
00:52:00,041 --> 00:52:03,082
or corner me by winning over my parents.

765
00:52:03,624 --> 00:52:07,457
I still remember how you'd pounce on me,

766
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,915
like a dog on a bone,
when we were at the movies.

767
00:52:16,499 --> 00:52:19,748
You're no different now, still as self-centred.

768
00:52:20,833 --> 00:52:23,582
You saw the porter giving me a message.

769
00:52:23,749 --> 00:52:26,248
You didn't even ask about it!

770
00:52:26,416 --> 00:52:27,832
Mere discretion.

771
00:52:27,999 --> 00:52:30,373
No, sheer indifference.

772
00:52:30,541 --> 00:52:32,832
What have we talked about
for the past two hours? You !

773
00:52:32,999 --> 00:52:34,957
Some discretion !

774
00:52:38,291 --> 00:52:41,623
Even if you don't care,
I'll tell you what I've become.

775
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:46,040
The message was from that gorilla,
the man in the corridor.

776
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:49,540
I can make 1 000 francs by sleeping
with him tonight.

777
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:52,582
Times are tough, Antoine.

778
00:52:52,749 --> 00:52:55,457
I've got a law degree, but no work.

779
00:52:55,624 --> 00:52:58,623
Still, an attractive girl can always get by.

780
00:52:58,791 --> 00:53:01,457
My speciality is night trains.

781
00:53:01,624 --> 00:53:03,665
I give 1 0% to the porter.

782
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:08,623
Get the picture? Right now,
because of you, I'm losing 1 000 francs.

783
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:14,748
I think I'd better leave.

784
00:55:02,624 --> 00:55:03,915
It's Antoine.

785
00:55:03,999 --> 00:55:05,957
Tell him you haven't seen me all day.

786
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:08,123
You don't know where I am.

787
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:13,748
I want to see Sabine.

788
00:55:13,916 --> 00:55:15,873
She's not in today.

789
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:17,873
Really?

790
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:25,082
All day?

791
00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:27,332
I'll call her.

792
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:31,290
Did he leave? I'm going home.

793
00:55:43,249 --> 00:55:44,415
I lost something !

794
00:55:44,583 --> 00:55:46,082
Something important?

795
00:55:46,249 --> 00:55:48,540
I lost a photograph.

796
00:55:48,833 --> 00:55:50,623
Want one of me?

797
00:55:50,791 --> 00:55:52,123
Drop dead.

798
00:56:02,916 --> 00:56:04,582
Sabine, open up.

799
00:56:06,124 --> 00:56:08,290
I know you're in there.

800
00:56:11,916 --> 00:56:14,832
Phone me, so I can hang up on you.

801
00:56:14,999 --> 00:56:17,415
You want me to apologise?

802
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:21,582
I'm sorry I hung up on you. Listen to me.

803
00:56:21,666 --> 00:56:22,707
I'm listening.

804
00:56:22,791 --> 00:56:25,123
I can't talk this way.

805
00:56:25,291 --> 00:56:26,957
Then save it for your book!

806
00:56:28,208 --> 00:56:32,290
That's the trouble.
I can't write when you're mad at me.

807
00:56:32,916 --> 00:56:34,582
You influence me,

808
00:56:34,749 --> 00:56:37,332
because of you, I've changed my ending.

809
00:56:37,499 --> 00:56:39,707
No suicide. The hero decides to live.

810
00:56:39,874 --> 00:56:43,707
You're right. Why incite others
to despair while you yourself

811
00:56:43,874 --> 00:56:45,290
enjoy life?

812
00:56:45,458 --> 00:56:47,665
It's hypocritical.

813
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:50,790
Right. I wish you'd stop being so hostile.

814
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:53,457
But I feel hostile towards you !

815
00:56:53,624 --> 00:56:54,998
About our vacation. . .

816
00:56:55,166 --> 00:56:59,582
Sorry, I've made other plans.
I'm going away by myself.

817
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:03,123
- Where to?
- 2000 miles from Paris.

818
00:57:03,708 --> 00:57:06,582
Open up.
I lost an important document in your place.

819
00:57:06,749 --> 00:57:08,540
It might convince you.

820
00:57:08,749 --> 00:57:09,873
Convince me of what?

821
00:57:10,041 --> 00:57:11,290
Of my good faith.

822
00:57:11,458 --> 00:57:12,832
Wait there.

823
00:57:16,874 --> 00:57:19,290
Look. Take your letters back.

824
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:22,790
I've got no use for that pack of lies.

825
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:37,707
"Sabine, my love,

826
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:40,707
"I hurried home to write to you.

827
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,332
"I can't even go to the movies without you.

828
00:57:43,499 --> 00:57:46,957
"I left you an hour ago. It seems a lifetime.

829
00:57:47,124 --> 00:57:50,582
"We just met and you're leaving."

830
00:57:50,749 --> 00:57:52,998
I'll be back in three days.

831
00:57:53,249 --> 00:57:56,332
Will you be faithful to me?

832
00:57:56,499 --> 00:58:00,415
Of course I will !

833
00:58:01,374 --> 00:58:02,915
What about you?

834
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:06,415
I have no choice. I'm totally

835
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:09,623
under your spell, you bastard.

836
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,873
Good. Stay that way.

837
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:15,707
But you said you weren't jealous
and I was free.

838
00:58:15,874 --> 00:58:18,373
I don't plan to. I just want to know.

839
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:21,915
True, I'm not jealous. Do as you please.

840
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:24,623
But try and be faithful to me,

841
00:58:25,124 --> 00:58:26,582
at least in your head.

842
00:58:27,999 --> 00:58:29,248
Let's shake on it.

843
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:31,748
It's a deal.

844
00:58:31,916 --> 00:58:34,082
First to fail is a worm !

845
00:58:47,166 --> 00:58:48,457
Here are the galleys.

846
00:58:48,624 --> 00:58:52,373
The book spells out everything
General de Gaulle did

847
00:58:52,541 --> 00:58:56,165
on May 30, 1 968, when
he disappeared for a whole day.

848
00:58:56,541 --> 00:58:59,290
The press is dying to get hold of this book.

849
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:01,540
The boss says it's top secret.

850
00:59:01,624 --> 00:59:02,623
Really?

851
00:59:02,708 --> 00:59:06,082
Yes, there's only one set of proofs,

852
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:09,165
and the type will be destroyed right
after printing.

853
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:12,832
Keep it in the safe. I'm off.

854
00:59:12,999 --> 00:59:15,748
Don't tell me the combination !

855
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:56,665
She was hurt by
the misunderstandings between you.

856
01:00:57,708 --> 01:00:59,623
Nobody understood her.

857
01:00:59,791 --> 01:01:02,623
People assumed she was bitter.
That wasn't it.

858
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:05,915
She just couldn't stand hypocrisy.

859
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:07,582
So she was sore at everybody:

860
01:01:07,749 --> 01:01:11,457
the press, clergy, shopkeepers, politicians.

861
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:14,207
Did you know that, at heart,

862
01:01:14,374 --> 01:01:16,665
your mother was an anarchist?

863
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:18,415
Maybe so.

864
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:21,748
I never thought of my mother as an anarchist.

865
01:01:22,583 --> 01:01:25,207
Of course, with me, she wasn't like that.

866
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:28,290
She was like a little bird.

867
01:01:31,124 --> 01:01:32,290
A little bird.

868
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:36,123
After your father's death,

869
01:01:36,291 --> 01:01:39,748
he and I were always good friends,

870
01:01:39,916 --> 01:01:43,998
her eyesight began to fail,
but she wouldn't wear glasses.

871
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:47,332
But we managed anyway.

872
01:01:47,499 --> 01:01:49,707
I'd read out loud to her.

873
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:51,498
One hour every night,

874
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,582
sometimes two hours.

875
01:01:55,666 --> 01:01:56,873
You still like books?

876
01:01:57,666 --> 01:01:59,582
Yes, I do, Mr Lucien.

877
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:00,832
When you were a kid,

878
01:02:00,999 --> 01:02:03,665
you were always buried in a book.

879
01:02:05,999 --> 01:02:07,915
Remember the first time we met?

880
01:02:08,249 --> 01:02:10,748
At the Edith Piaf concert.

881
01:02:14,333 --> 01:02:17,832
But we'd seen each other before that.

882
01:02:25,166 --> 01:02:28,790
lmagine her shock seeing you in the street

883
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:31,540
when you were supposed to be in school.

884
01:02:31,708 --> 01:02:34,665
I didn't know you. I asked her,

885
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:36,332
"Which one's your son?"

886
01:02:39,666 --> 01:02:41,623
You seemed much taller.

887
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:43,332
That's because you were so small.

888
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:55,415
Here you are!

889
01:02:56,333 --> 01:02:59,207
The extra homework made you sick

890
01:02:59,458 --> 01:03:01,207
and your parents fell for it.

891
01:03:01,374 --> 01:03:04,207
What pretext did you wangle
from them this time?

892
01:03:04,749 --> 01:03:06,248
Let's see their note.

893
01:03:06,458 --> 01:03:08,040
- I haven't any.
- Is that so?

894
01:03:08,666 --> 01:03:11,707
You won't get away with it. Not this time!

895
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:15,790
It's my mother, Sir.

896
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,665
What about your mother?

897
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,498
She just died.

898
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:25,040
I'm sorry, son. I didn't know.

899
01:03:28,541 --> 01:03:29,623
Doinel !

900
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:32,332
Excuse me, son.

901
01:03:32,499 --> 01:03:33,790
Simonot!

902
01:03:34,374 --> 01:03:45,040
The Hare.

903
01:03:45,166 --> 01:03:49,040
By Jean Richepin.

904
01:03:50,916 --> 01:03:52,415
Sit down, boys.

905
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:21,290
Just wait till I get you home!

906
01:04:22,624 --> 01:04:24,123
To tell you the truth,

907
01:04:25,541 --> 01:04:28,165
I felt bad that you missed her funeral.

908
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:30,165
I couldn't help it.

909
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:34,082
I was in an army jail in Germany.

910
01:04:34,249 --> 01:04:35,957
The C.O. sent for me.

911
01:04:36,124 --> 01:04:39,665
He gave me three days off for the funeral,

912
01:04:39,833 --> 01:04:41,457
but he couldn't issue my travel order.

913
01:04:41,624 --> 01:04:44,498
I couldn't afford a ticket, so I stayed in jail.

914
01:04:45,166 --> 01:04:47,290
I was puzzled by your absence,

915
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:50,832
but I felt sure it wasn't indifference.

916
01:04:50,999 --> 01:04:53,040
Your mother loved you.

917
01:04:53,208 --> 01:04:56,373
In a strange way, perhaps,
but she really cared.

918
01:05:00,624 --> 01:05:03,873
It wasn't easy to get a plot
in Montmartre cemetery.

919
01:05:04,041 --> 01:05:06,373
But I insisted.

920
01:05:07,124 --> 01:05:09,207
She loved that area.

921
01:05:09,749 --> 01:05:13,248
She's buried right next
to Marguerite Gautier.

922
01:05:14,416 --> 01:05:16,123
You know who she was?

923
01:05:17,624 --> 01:05:19,040
I don't think so.

924
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:23,665
The heroine of CamiIIe,
by Alexandre Dumas.

925
01:05:23,833 --> 01:05:25,832
I thought he'd invented her.

926
01:05:25,999 --> 01:05:27,873
No, she really existed.

927
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:31,832
Your mother's buried next to her.
Didn't you notice?

928
01:05:32,916 --> 01:05:36,165
Frankly, I've never visited my mother's grave.

929
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:40,582
I didn't even know where she was buried.

930
01:05:41,791 --> 01:05:45,207
I can hardly believe my ears!

931
01:05:48,166 --> 01:05:49,623
Know what?

932
01:05:49,833 --> 01:05:51,665
When do you report back to work?

933
01:05:51,833 --> 01:05:55,290
At 2:30 p.m.

934
01:05:55,458 --> 01:05:58,790
It's 1 9 francs. That's 9.50 each.

935
01:06:04,499 --> 01:06:06,623
After your mother's death

936
01:06:06,791 --> 01:06:09,457
I sort of broke down.

937
01:06:13,624 --> 01:06:15,915
So I quit my Civil Service job.

938
01:06:16,416 --> 01:06:20,165
I was fed up with bowing and scraping.

939
01:06:22,291 --> 01:06:25,332
Then, I set up a small business on my own.

940
01:06:28,166 --> 01:06:29,707
Very small.

941
01:06:30,374 --> 01:06:33,415
I rent dress clothes by the day.

942
01:06:36,916 --> 01:06:38,707
The grave's this way.

943
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:53,707
By now, you surely realise that

944
01:06:53,999 --> 01:06:56,832
your parents can't be blamed
for all your troubles.

945
01:06:57,458 --> 01:07:00,082
Some were your fault as well.

946
01:07:03,874 --> 01:07:06,207
I'd like to see you again.

947
01:07:08,166 --> 01:07:11,207
You may not believe this,

948
01:07:12,291 --> 01:07:13,832
but the more I look at you,

949
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:18,290
the more you remind me of her.

950
01:07:23,374 --> 01:07:25,457
How sad it all is!

951
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:29,290
Anyway, I'm glad you've finally
seen your mother's grave.

952
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:31,998
By the way,

953
01:07:32,749 --> 01:07:34,707
here's my card.

954
01:07:35,291 --> 01:07:39,123
If you ever need a tuxedo,

955
01:07:39,916 --> 01:07:43,832
you're a size 36. For you, it's free!

956
01:07:44,666 --> 01:07:47,915
Thanks, Mr Lucien. If I ever need one. . .

957
01:07:56,499 --> 01:07:58,415
May I kiss you?

958
01:08:02,874 --> 01:08:04,123
"My darling Sabine,

959
01:08:04,916 --> 01:08:07,040
"whom I love and who shuns me.

960
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:11,373
"I must tell you my strange meeting today.

961
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:14,123
"I saw Mr Lucien.

962
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:17,165
"He was one of my mother's lovers,

963
01:08:17,333 --> 01:08:18,373
"the main one.

964
01:08:19,083 --> 01:08:21,998
"His questions
about my mother reminded me

965
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:25,165
"of the psychologist. In there, we called her

966
01:08:25,333 --> 01:08:26,582
"the spychologist."

967
01:08:31,999 --> 01:08:33,582
Your parents say you're a liar.

968
01:08:35,833 --> 01:08:38,123
Well, I lie sometimes,

969
01:08:38,749 --> 01:08:43,748
because if I told the truth,
they wouldn't believe me. So I lie.

970
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:47,290
"Mr Lucien said my mother
was like a little bird."

971
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:50,082
A little bird !

972
01:08:51,124 --> 01:08:53,665
"Were we talking about the same person?

973
01:08:54,666 --> 01:08:58,665
"Still, she taught me that love
is the only thing that matters.

974
01:09:00,333 --> 01:09:02,665
"When she came home,
I'd pretend to be asleep.

975
01:09:16,708 --> 01:09:18,373
"Love's the antithesis of prison.

976
01:09:18,749 --> 01:09:22,707
"I was only 1 3, but the spychologist
wanted to know about my love life."

977
01:09:24,291 --> 01:09:26,498
Have you ever slept with a girl?

978
01:09:31,541 --> 01:09:35,832
No, but some guys told me
where to go if I felt like it.

979
01:09:35,999 --> 01:09:38,998
They said the girl hung around Saint-Denis.

980
01:09:39,166 --> 01:09:41,123
So I went there and. . .

981
01:09:41,958 --> 01:09:44,165
The girls bawled me out.

982
01:09:44,333 --> 01:09:46,540
So I got scared and beat it.

983
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:48,873
I went back there a few times.

984
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:52,582
Once, a man asked what I was doing.

985
01:09:52,916 --> 01:09:56,873
He was North African.
I told him because he knew the girls.

986
01:09:57,041 --> 01:09:59,582
He said he knew one. . .

987
01:10:01,041 --> 01:10:05,207
a young one who went with guys my age.

988
01:10:06,208 --> 01:10:09,748
So he took me to her hotel.

989
01:10:09,916 --> 01:10:12,457
But she wasn't there that day.

990
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:16,332
We waited for over two hours and then I split.

991
01:10:17,249 --> 01:10:19,457
"I started late with girls.

992
01:10:20,124 --> 01:10:24,123
"Then it was as if I wanted
to make up for lost time.

993
01:10:24,541 --> 01:10:26,665
"I needed constant reassurance.

994
01:10:27,166 --> 01:10:29,123
"Would this wide-eyed girl like me?

995
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:31,457
"The student? The salesgirl?

996
01:10:31,624 --> 01:10:33,582
"The typist at the Ministry?

997
01:10:33,916 --> 01:10:35,665
"The night clerk's daughter?

998
01:10:36,791 --> 01:10:37,832
"One fine day..."

999
01:10:38,124 --> 01:10:39,373
A fine day, indeed.

1000
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:40,873
"I met you, Sabine,

1001
01:10:41,291 --> 01:10:43,207
"and stopped looking at other women.

1002
01:10:43,624 --> 01:10:45,998
"Remember our first date at the movies?

1003
01:10:46,333 --> 01:10:49,665
"You clung to me because of the violence."

1004
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:52,498
It's horrible. I hate boxing !

1005
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:05,123
"I was so glad you hated boxing !

1006
01:11:11,916 --> 01:11:15,040
"But now you're rejecting me.

1007
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:16,415
"I feel hopeless.

1008
01:11:16,916 --> 01:11:19,290
"I may kill off the hero of my novel."

1009
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:37,915
Wait. If they're not legally married,

1010
01:11:38,249 --> 01:11:41,332
he can't be the kid's stepfather.

1011
01:11:41,499 --> 01:11:43,457
The boy was actually his own son,

1012
01:11:43,624 --> 01:11:46,582
but he claimed his wife's lover
was the father.

1013
01:11:46,749 --> 01:11:49,082
His defence is based on that?

1014
01:11:49,249 --> 01:11:52,415
At the moment,
he's not concerned with his defence.

1015
01:11:53,291 --> 01:11:54,790
When the mob saw him

1016
01:11:54,958 --> 01:11:57,790
spit on the kid's body, they went wild.

1017
01:11:57,958 --> 01:12:01,457
Despite the police, they almost lynched him.

1018
01:12:01,624 --> 01:12:03,415
He doesn't want a lawyer.

1019
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:07,123
I was appointed by the Court,
but it's hopeless.

1020
01:12:07,291 --> 01:12:09,540
All he does is curse me.

1021
01:12:09,749 --> 01:12:11,790
That's why we felt that. . .

1022
01:12:11,958 --> 01:12:15,248
Don't tell me.
You felt a woman might tame the brute.

1023
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:18,790
You know how the public feels
about child murderers.

1024
01:12:19,208 --> 01:12:21,665
Why should I feel any different?

1025
01:12:23,208 --> 01:12:25,748
Even so, I'm willing to meet him.

1026
01:12:25,958 --> 01:12:28,748
But first, I have to examine the evidence.

1027
01:12:45,999 --> 01:12:48,165
You might as well go home.

1028
01:12:48,333 --> 01:12:51,457
He just tried to kill himself.

1029
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:54,623
An hour ago. He's in the prison infirmary.

1030
01:12:55,416 --> 01:12:57,332
- Slit his wrists.
- A piece of glass.

1031
01:12:57,499 --> 01:12:58,998
From his watch?

1032
01:12:59,999 --> 01:13:02,540
He broke the light bulb in his cell.

1033
01:13:04,083 --> 01:13:07,332
You have a week to make up your mind.

1034
01:13:07,833 --> 01:13:10,873
We'll be in touch with you.

1035
01:13:14,124 --> 01:13:17,082
I shouldn't admit it, but I'm relieved.

1036
01:13:17,749 --> 01:13:19,748
I need time to think.

1037
01:13:19,916 --> 01:13:21,957
Shall we take you to the station?

1038
01:13:22,749 --> 01:13:25,207
I'd appreciate it. I'm really upset.

1039
01:13:25,374 --> 01:13:28,665
I want a friend to meet me in Paris.
May I call him?

1040
01:13:47,416 --> 01:13:49,415
BARNERlAS
BOOKSTORE

1041
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:09,373
Barnerias. . . Sabine Barnerias!

1042
01:14:12,624 --> 01:14:14,373
That does it!

1043
01:14:15,958 --> 01:14:19,207
I thought these things only
happened in soap operas!

1044
01:14:20,958 --> 01:14:24,998
A married man passing himself off
as a bachelor!

1045
01:15:19,249 --> 01:15:20,957
I've almost broken off with him.

1046
01:15:22,291 --> 01:15:24,873
It may be the dumbest thing I ever did.

1047
01:15:29,666 --> 01:15:31,207
And you?

1048
01:15:31,624 --> 01:15:32,957
Me?

1049
01:15:35,124 --> 01:15:36,790
The same as usual.

1050
01:15:37,999 --> 01:15:39,540
It's a deadlock.

1051
01:15:42,791 --> 01:15:44,498
I'm stumped.

1052
01:15:47,249 --> 01:15:50,748
We're both alike.
We'll probably wind up together.

1053
01:16:07,208 --> 01:16:09,498
I don't get this movie.

1054
01:16:09,666 --> 01:16:12,623
I thought he was the killer.

1055
01:16:15,166 --> 01:16:17,165
Have you got a handkerchief?

1056
01:16:18,916 --> 01:16:20,207
Only Kleenex. Want one?

1057
01:16:20,583 --> 01:16:22,665
I never blow my nose in paper.

1058
01:16:30,708 --> 01:16:31,915
Is Mr Xavier in?

1059
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:34,082
No, he isn't.

1060
01:16:34,249 --> 01:16:36,457
Fine, I don't give a damn !

1061
01:16:49,541 --> 01:16:51,873
I must reach him immediately.

1062
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:54,373
Give me his wife's number.

1063
01:16:54,541 --> 01:16:56,540
He's not married.

1064
01:16:56,749 --> 01:16:58,832
Then, his ex-wife's number.

1065
01:16:58,999 --> 01:17:02,582
I assure you he's never been married.

1066
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:06,123
He hasn't?

1067
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:10,415
Who's this? His fairy godmother?

1068
01:17:10,583 --> 01:17:13,540
That's his sister, Sabine.
Don't you know her?

1069
01:17:13,708 --> 01:17:16,998
She works in a record shop.

1070
01:17:55,458 --> 01:17:56,457
Me?

1071
01:17:56,541 --> 01:17:57,873
Yes, you.

1072
01:17:59,124 --> 01:18:02,123
Are you Sabine Barnerias?

1073
01:18:02,291 --> 01:18:03,748
No, I'm not.

1074
01:18:03,916 --> 01:18:04,957
Sorry.

1075
01:18:05,041 --> 01:18:06,915
I'm not Sabine Barnerias.

1076
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:09,748
But you and I belong to the same sorority.

1077
01:18:09,916 --> 01:18:13,373
We're both ex-girlfriends of Antoine Doinel.

1078
01:18:14,458 --> 01:18:18,248
I saw you the other day
at the Divorce Court. I'm a lawyer.

1079
01:18:18,458 --> 01:18:21,707
I'm also Colette,
the girl from the Youth Concerts.

1080
01:18:21,874 --> 01:18:23,290
Oh, of course!

1081
01:18:24,541 --> 01:18:25,665
Going to Sabine's?

1082
01:18:25,749 --> 01:18:26,748
Yes, I am.

1083
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:30,832
I rang. She's not home.
I don't know what to do.

1084
01:18:31,249 --> 01:18:33,498
Let's wait for her together.
Somewhere more comfortable.

1085
01:18:33,666 --> 01:18:35,665
Sure, there are benches in the courtyard.

1086
01:18:44,124 --> 01:18:47,540
I suspect you're here on a special mission.

1087
01:18:47,833 --> 01:18:49,748
Quite right. And you?

1088
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:52,457
Me too, but it's for myself.

1089
01:18:52,624 --> 01:18:56,457
I know her brother.
I was tying up some loose ends.

1090
01:18:57,041 --> 01:18:59,498
I just read Antoine's book.
To you, it's ancient history,

1091
01:18:59,666 --> 01:19:01,623
but it shook me up.

1092
01:19:01,791 --> 01:19:03,082
Shall we sit down?

1093
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:10,832
That heel ! He makes me
feel guilty retroactively.

1094
01:19:11,083 --> 01:19:13,415
So I'm trying to help him out.

1095
01:19:13,583 --> 01:19:17,707
I've always suspected he married me
only because you turned him down.

1096
01:19:18,374 --> 01:19:21,082
It wasn't that way at all.

1097
01:19:21,249 --> 01:19:23,123
When I met him, I was a student.

1098
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:27,457
He had a job but we were both
too young to think of marriage.

1099
01:19:31,541 --> 01:19:33,415
Sit down. Have you eaten yet?

1100
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:35,082
You have?

1101
01:19:35,166 --> 01:19:36,332
I ate, thanks.

1102
01:19:36,416 --> 01:19:37,665
Are you sure?

1103
01:19:38,083 --> 01:19:40,373
I can whip up an omelette.

1104
01:19:40,541 --> 01:19:43,165
No thanks, I'll just have a tangerine.

1105
01:19:44,708 --> 01:19:46,582
You want a plate for the peels?

1106
01:19:46,749 --> 01:19:49,082
Don't bother. I'll use yours.

1107
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:52,707
Not again !

1108
01:19:52,791 --> 01:19:54,498
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

1109
01:19:54,666 --> 01:19:56,540
It's a real parade today.

1110
01:20:01,458 --> 01:20:04,248
Hello. Come in.

1111
01:20:06,791 --> 01:20:08,832
Antoine had won my parent's affection.

1112
01:20:09,249 --> 01:20:10,832
He came by often.

1113
01:20:10,958 --> 01:20:14,623
He didn't realise that now
I regarded him as a kid cousin.

1114
01:20:15,291 --> 01:20:16,332
I longed for

1115
01:20:16,416 --> 01:20:18,415
more thrilling adventures.

1116
01:20:18,583 --> 01:20:21,415
This is Albert. I've told you about him.

1117
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:24,790
My stepfather.

1118
01:20:26,041 --> 01:20:27,290
Antoine. . .

1119
01:20:27,458 --> 01:20:28,915
I believe you've already met.

1120
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:31,873
- We met once.
- I'll get my coat.

1121
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:34,623
Got a cigarette?

1122
01:20:39,958 --> 01:20:43,415
I'm ready. Let's go.

1123
01:20:43,583 --> 01:20:44,915
Good night.

1124
01:20:46,083 --> 01:20:48,707
Antoine also longed for thrills.

1125
01:20:48,874 --> 01:20:51,998
Liliane and I had become close friends.

1126
01:20:52,166 --> 01:20:54,248
She spent a summer with us.

1127
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:57,123
Antoine argued with her constantly.

1128
01:20:57,791 --> 01:21:01,457
I'm not excited, I'm calm.

1129
01:21:03,749 --> 01:21:07,165
I always have anxieties. So what?

1130
01:21:14,124 --> 01:21:16,082
Stop fighting ! Lunch is ready.

1131
01:21:18,083 --> 01:21:19,957
One day, I ran short of cash while shopping,

1132
01:21:20,124 --> 01:21:23,540
so I came home early. The door was shut.

1133
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:25,832
Another fight, I said to myself.

1134
01:21:25,999 --> 01:21:30,915
The day before, I'd asked Antoine
to be nicer to Liliane.

1135
01:21:39,249 --> 01:21:40,415
It was a shock.

1136
01:21:40,583 --> 01:21:42,457
An even bigger one for them !

1137
01:21:42,624 --> 01:21:46,665
Antoine's justification was typical of him.

1138
01:21:46,958 --> 01:21:48,665
He'd given her a book.

1139
01:21:48,833 --> 01:21:50,790
He noticed that to protect it

1140
01:21:51,458 --> 01:21:55,082
she'd made a dust-jacket
with a newspaper. This so moved him.

1141
01:21:55,249 --> 01:21:57,123
That he hopped into bed with her!

1142
01:21:57,291 --> 01:21:59,957
- Right!
- That's perfectly logical !

1143
01:22:01,624 --> 01:22:03,665
Strangely enough, I wasn't upset.

1144
01:22:03,833 --> 01:22:08,207
My lack of jealousy made me realise
I was no longer in love with him.

1145
01:22:08,666 --> 01:22:12,332
I'd married too young.
I wasn't yet an adult. We separated.

1146
01:22:12,666 --> 01:22:15,915
He lived with Liliane
until she decided to leave him.

1147
01:22:16,499 --> 01:22:19,123
Then too, he asked me to talk her out of it.

1148
01:22:19,291 --> 01:22:21,082
Don't leave him.

1149
01:22:21,249 --> 01:22:22,707
He'll fall apart.

1150
01:22:22,874 --> 01:22:24,832
He's always falling apart.

1151
01:22:24,999 --> 01:22:29,123
He needs a wife, a mistress,
a kid sister and a wet-nurse.

1152
01:22:29,291 --> 01:22:32,040
I can't fill all those functions.

1153
01:22:32,291 --> 01:22:34,290
You're being unfair to him.

1154
01:22:34,458 --> 01:22:38,373
I can't help it. He wants everyone
to pay for his unhappy childhood.

1155
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:41,832
Liliane really wanted to live alone
and adopt a child.

1156
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:43,623
Which reminds me,

1157
01:22:43,791 --> 01:22:45,248
Antoine said he met you

1158
01:22:45,416 --> 01:22:47,082
one day with your baby.

1159
01:22:48,416 --> 01:22:50,248
I must kiss you.

1160
01:22:51,208 --> 01:22:53,248
Albert, you remember Antoine.

1161
01:22:53,874 --> 01:22:55,290
Albert, my husband.

1162
01:22:55,458 --> 01:22:56,832
What are you doing here?

1163
01:22:56,999 --> 01:22:58,332
Waiting for a friend.

1164
01:22:59,791 --> 01:23:02,290
You're wondering if it's a boy or a girl.

1165
01:23:03,708 --> 01:23:06,540
You must come over some evening.

1166
01:23:07,708 --> 01:23:09,957
Do you have my number?

1167
01:23:10,374 --> 01:23:11,540
I think so.

1168
01:23:11,708 --> 01:23:14,248
Well, you haven't used it lately.

1169
01:23:14,791 --> 01:23:17,623
You never used to be afraid of the phone.

1170
01:23:18,749 --> 01:23:20,748
See you soon.

1171
01:23:21,583 --> 01:23:23,790
Is your child a girl or a boy?

1172
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:26,748
She was a little girl, Julie.

1173
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:30,332
She's not with me because she's dead.

1174
01:23:31,374 --> 01:23:33,790
She was run over by a car.

1175
01:23:33,958 --> 01:23:35,248
Mother!

1176
01:23:52,958 --> 01:23:55,082
I didn't want any more children.

1177
01:23:55,249 --> 01:23:58,707
I didn't dare. I went back
to school. I did my best.

1178
01:23:59,374 --> 01:24:02,332
But for my husband and me, it was over.

1179
01:24:02,499 --> 01:24:03,540
We split up.

1180
01:24:05,124 --> 01:24:06,123
It's been five years.

1181
01:24:06,249 --> 01:24:11,248
I've just agreed to defend
that man in Draguignan.

1182
01:24:11,416 --> 01:24:13,415
He murdered his child.

1183
01:24:13,583 --> 01:24:16,665
He beat his 3-year-old son to death.

1184
01:24:18,249 --> 01:24:21,707
I may be crazy, but I've decided
to take on his case.

1185
01:24:24,208 --> 01:24:27,582
I think I won't wait for Sabine.

1186
01:24:28,374 --> 01:24:30,582
Why should I worry about Antoine

1187
01:24:30,749 --> 01:24:33,248
when my own life is so confused?

1188
01:24:34,666 --> 01:24:37,498
The things lawyers have to do!

1189
01:24:38,791 --> 01:24:40,957
I love a man. He runs a bookshop.

1190
01:24:41,124 --> 01:24:42,707
I love Sabine's brother.

1191
01:24:42,874 --> 01:24:45,957
I must tell him I love him before it's too late.

1192
01:24:46,333 --> 01:24:48,207
I can't waste time. Wait!

1193
01:24:48,374 --> 01:24:51,207
Take this. It's a picture of Sabine.

1194
01:24:51,416 --> 01:24:55,123
If Antoine gets it back, I can't explain it all,

1195
01:24:55,291 --> 01:24:57,707
but it may lead to a happy ending.

1196
01:25:09,499 --> 01:25:11,332
A letter for your pal.

1197
01:25:21,791 --> 01:25:23,707
Wake up. It's 7 a.m.

1198
01:25:23,874 --> 01:25:25,957
This came for you.

1199
01:26:56,999 --> 01:26:59,123
I made love to you right away.

1200
01:26:59,291 --> 01:27:01,498
I wanted to as much as you did.

1201
01:27:01,749 --> 01:27:05,373
Later on, I asked you where we stood.

1202
01:27:06,166 --> 01:27:08,498
You wouldn't answer my question.

1203
01:27:09,041 --> 01:27:11,248
I decided to protect myself.

1204
01:27:12,416 --> 01:27:14,457
I don't know much,

1205
01:27:14,624 --> 01:27:16,457
but I'm sure that two people
who love each other

1206
01:27:16,624 --> 01:27:18,165
should share everything.

1207
01:27:18,333 --> 01:27:22,582
What happens to one,
happens to both without exceptions.

1208
01:27:23,249 --> 01:27:25,665
If I'm wrong, I don't understand love.

1209
01:27:28,499 --> 01:27:30,957
I knew what I expected of you.

1210
01:27:31,124 --> 01:27:33,165
When I realised you couldn't decide

1211
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:36,207
between life with me, or without me.

1212
01:27:36,874 --> 01:27:39,082
I knew I had to be careful.

1213
01:27:41,249 --> 01:27:44,290
I did my best to control my feelings for you.

1214
01:27:45,583 --> 01:27:46,998
I failed.

1215
01:27:47,166 --> 01:27:51,123
Since I hate suffering,
I decided to stop seeing you.

1216
01:27:52,291 --> 01:27:55,082
I let you pick me up in the store. It was fun.

1217
01:27:55,416 --> 01:27:56,873
I don't regret it.

1218
01:27:57,458 --> 01:28:01,415
But in this shop,
pick-up artists are a dime a dozen.

1219
01:28:01,583 --> 01:28:03,165
How can you say that?

1220
01:28:03,749 --> 01:28:05,707
I'm not a pick-up artist.

1221
01:28:05,874 --> 01:28:08,165
Yes, you are.

1222
01:28:08,333 --> 01:28:11,082
I can spot them before they walk in

1223
01:28:11,249 --> 01:28:13,998
from the way they ogle me
through the window.

1224
01:28:14,708 --> 01:28:16,998
I came here looking for you.

1225
01:28:17,166 --> 01:28:20,248
I'd already known you for two weeks.

1226
01:28:20,416 --> 01:28:22,082
- It's not true!
- It isn't?

1227
01:28:22,166 --> 01:28:23,207
Of course not.

1228
01:28:23,291 --> 01:28:25,332
Listen to me carefully.

1229
01:28:27,624 --> 01:28:31,123
One day last year, I went into a cafe
to make a phone call.

1230
01:28:31,666 --> 01:28:34,248
The phone booth was in the basement.

1231
01:28:34,333 --> 01:28:36,665
There was a man inside.

1232
01:28:36,916 --> 01:28:38,873
He was yelling.

1233
01:28:39,249 --> 01:28:41,457
He was in rage.

1234
01:28:41,624 --> 01:28:43,082
I overheard him.

1235
01:28:43,791 --> 01:28:46,123
I gathered he was screaming at a woman,

1236
01:28:46,291 --> 01:28:47,998
breaking things off with her.

1237
01:28:48,291 --> 01:28:50,707
At one point,

1238
01:28:50,874 --> 01:28:53,457
the man became violent.

1239
01:28:53,833 --> 01:28:55,998
He took a picture out of his pocket,

1240
01:28:56,166 --> 01:28:57,998
like a postcard.

1241
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:00,290
Wedging the phone on his shoulder,

1242
01:29:00,999 --> 01:29:02,540
he tore up the picture

1243
01:29:02,708 --> 01:29:03,707
just like that.

1244
01:29:03,874 --> 01:29:06,415
He threw the pieces to the floor.

1245
01:29:07,166 --> 01:29:09,498
After hanging up, he stormed out.

1246
01:29:10,791 --> 01:29:14,790
So I went in, into the booth.

1247
01:29:15,499 --> 01:29:18,248
I don't know why I did it,

1248
01:29:18,958 --> 01:29:21,915
but I picked up all the pieces

1249
01:29:22,583 --> 01:29:23,915
and put them in my pocket.

1250
01:29:24,249 --> 01:29:26,790
Back home, I went to work

1251
01:29:27,083 --> 01:29:30,540
and constructed the picture with scotch tape.

1252
01:29:31,708 --> 01:29:33,290
After a while,

1253
01:29:33,624 --> 01:29:35,373
as if by magic,

1254
01:29:35,541 --> 01:29:37,123
the puzzle was assembled.

1255
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:39,790
A woman's face emerged.

1256
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:41,332
I fell in love,

1257
01:29:41,666 --> 01:29:43,582
madly in love with her.

1258
01:29:43,916 --> 01:29:45,915
I ran to the photographer

1259
01:29:46,083 --> 01:29:48,373
whose imprint was on the picture.

1260
01:29:48,791 --> 01:29:52,707
He had sold his shop.
No one knew where he'd moved to.

1261
01:29:52,958 --> 01:29:55,082
I searched all of Paris

1262
01:29:55,249 --> 01:29:56,457
to find him.

1263
01:29:56,624 --> 01:29:57,873
I asked everyone,

1264
01:29:58,041 --> 01:29:59,498
went everywhere.

1265
01:29:59,666 --> 01:30:01,248
I bothered strangers

1266
01:30:01,416 --> 01:30:02,957
who reacted angrily.

1267
01:30:03,124 --> 01:30:04,623
Often, I had to run like hell.

1268
01:30:04,791 --> 01:30:06,498
I tailed people.

1269
01:30:07,208 --> 01:30:08,248
At long last,

1270
01:30:08,416 --> 01:30:10,832
I managed to track the woman down.

1271
01:30:11,333 --> 01:30:12,707
I learned her name.

1272
01:30:13,124 --> 01:30:15,748
In time, I found out

1273
01:30:15,916 --> 01:30:17,165
where she worked.

1274
01:30:17,333 --> 01:30:18,582
During all this time,

1275
01:30:18,749 --> 01:30:22,207
the picture of the woman
I already loved never left me.

1276
01:30:22,541 --> 01:30:23,540
Want to see it?

1277
01:30:25,499 --> 01:30:26,540
Look!

1278
01:30:30,333 --> 01:30:33,748
I remember.
You wanted a non-existent record.

1279
01:30:34,083 --> 01:30:37,457
I concealed my feelings for you.

1280
01:30:37,791 --> 01:30:39,457
I even made you laugh.

1281
01:30:39,624 --> 01:30:43,248
You came back again
and made me fall in love with you.

1282
01:30:43,666 --> 01:30:45,707
I couldn't figure you out.

1283
01:30:45,874 --> 01:30:49,040
I thought, "He hasn't even noticed I'm a girl."

1284
01:30:49,208 --> 01:30:51,873
Yet my heart was pounding away.

1285
01:30:52,041 --> 01:30:53,540
You sure fooled me.

1286
01:30:53,708 --> 01:30:55,457
If I'd known. . .

1287
01:30:55,624 --> 01:30:58,040
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

1288
01:30:58,458 --> 01:31:01,873
I've concealed my feelings all my life.

1289
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:03,623
I've always been evasive.

1290
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:05,832
You don't trust anyone.

1291
01:31:05,999 --> 01:31:09,123
I trust you Sabine. I really do.

1292
01:31:09,541 --> 01:31:12,248
There's no way of knowing if it will last.

1293
01:31:12,416 --> 01:31:13,748
- Why not?
- It might.

1294
01:31:13,916 --> 01:31:14,915
Let's pretend.

1295
01:31:15,083 --> 01:31:16,748
- We'll see.
- Yes, we'll see.

1296
01:31:21,291 --> 01:31:24,123
Do you have Alain Souchon's last record?

1297
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:26,915
You're in luck. It just came in.

1298
01:31:29,499 --> 01:31:30,873
It's called Love On The Run.

1299
01:31:31,041 --> 01:31:32,248
Can we hear it?

1300
01:31:32,416 --> 01:31:33,665
In the booth.

1301
01:31:34,305 --> 01:32:34,754
