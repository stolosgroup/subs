"The Girl By The Lake"

3
00:01:41,314 --> 00:01:44,306
Make sure you go straight home.

4
00:01:46,153 --> 00:01:48,587
You're going to school tomorrow.

5
00:01:48,622 --> 00:01:49,919
Promise.

6
00:01:49,956 --> 00:01:52,151
I promise, auntie.

7
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:56,954
- Bye.
- Bye.

8
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,677
- Good morning, Maria.
- Hi, Marta.

9
00:02:32,032 --> 00:02:34,227
- Hi, Marta.
- Hi, Silvia.

10
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:56,352
Anna.

11
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:02,752
It's late.

12
00:03:03,763 --> 00:03:07,927
I was dreaming.
You shouldn't have woken me up.

13
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:56,709
Hi, Mario.

14
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:15,629
I can't.
Mom'll get worried.

15
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,840
All right.

16
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:49,326
Bye, Alfredo.

17
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:33,274
"My darling, I've been longing
to write to you for ages..."

18
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,009
- Lorenzo!
- Paola, what is it?

19
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:16,545
- Marta's gone missing!
- What?

20
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:18,989
We've been looking for her
for the past hour!

21
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:21,323
What'll I do?

22
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:24,023
Calm down.
Tell me what happened.

23
00:06:24,064 --> 00:06:28,057
I've looked everywhere for her!

24
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:30,661
When I'm on night shift,
she sleeps at Lucia's,

25
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:33,935
and if she skips school,
she comes home by herself.

26
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:35,668
But this morning...

27
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:37,939
- Maybe she's with a friend.
- No!

28
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:41,378
She only stops to feed
Mr. Armando's dog.

29
00:06:41,414 --> 00:06:42,608
I'll help you.

30
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:45,015
They're looking for her
out of town too.

31
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:48,214
Out of town?
Why?

32
00:06:48,254 --> 00:06:51,655
Why would she go out of town?

33
00:06:51,691 --> 00:06:54,182
His name's Hercules.

34
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:56,161
He's sick.

35
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:58,130
But he's my favorite.

36
00:06:58,164 --> 00:07:01,258
He's the oldest of them all.

37
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:04,361
You can stroke him,
if you like.

38
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:08,135
My father would like to fry him,
but I won't let him.

39
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:13,441
I've made a grave for him
nearby for when he dies.

40
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,176
I'd rather fry my father.

41
00:07:16,216 --> 00:07:19,208
Can I use your toilet?

42
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,310
It's over there.

43
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:54,884
Yes?

44
00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:58,580
Yes, it's me.

45
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,091
Since when?

46
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:16,004
I'll be down in ten minutes.

47
00:09:31,217 --> 00:09:32,844
The little girl?

48
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:39,890
Mario,
I asked you where the girl is!

49
00:09:42,695 --> 00:09:43,889
She's gone.

50
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:47,993
Are you happy now?

51
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:51,993
Where did you leave your jacket?

52
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:57,907
I lost it.

53
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:22,258
Inspector, I'm sorry to bother you for
something so silly.

54
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:23,455
Is that her?

55
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:25,691
Yes, she was on her way
into town.

56
00:11:25,732 --> 00:11:28,496
- Did she say where she'd been?
- To see Mario's rabbits.

57
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:32,527
- Who's this Mario?
- A weirdo, but he's harmless.

58
00:11:32,572 --> 00:11:35,336
Everyone's harmless
till they turn nasty.

59
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,536
And who are you?

60
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:39,807
I'm Giovanni.

61
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:41,939
Your mom called me.
She was worried.

62
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:45,212
- Is she mad?
- I don't think so.

63
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:47,082
We'd better go.
She's waiting.

64
00:11:48,621 --> 00:11:51,681
Mario's worried that his dad
will take Hercules

65
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:53,817
and fry him.

66
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,420
- Who's Hercules?
- A rabbit.

67
00:11:56,462 --> 00:11:59,761
I wanted to take him with us,
but Mario said

68
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:03,291
that he'd be frightened
at the Lake of the Serpent.

69
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:05,167
It's a small lake near here.
There's a legend.

70
00:12:05,204 --> 00:12:07,536
A snake lives in the water,

71
00:12:07,573 --> 00:12:13,978
and if you look at it,
you fall asleep forever.

72
00:12:14,013 --> 00:12:15,105
Do you believe that?

73
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:17,480
It's not a legend!

74
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:27,719
Today the snake came
and cast a spell.

75
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:30,052
Nonsense, sweetheart...

76
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:35,892
Will you tell me what happened
at the lake with Mario?

77
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:39,665
Marta!

78
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:47,045
Maybe we should
leave them alone awhile.

79
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:15,404
Inspector.

80
00:14:10,696 --> 00:14:12,254
Holy God.

81
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:48,228
- You know who she is?
- It's Anna.

82
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:50,098
Anna Nadאl.

83
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:38,882
Can you be quiet, please?

84
00:15:41,787 --> 00:15:45,689
Siboldi, who are you calling?

85
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:47,283
Sorry, I've finished.

86
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:51,387
- Seen anyone from the station?
- Yes, Prosecutor Giani is here.

87
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,455
I don't see her anymore.

88
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:02,203
- You want the jacket kept on?
- Leave her as she is.

89
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:05,574
When you've taken enough photos,
remove the jacket.

90
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:13,183
- How did she die?
- Respiratory failure.

91
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:16,950
She could've drowned,
but there may be another cause.

92
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:19,787
- Seen the marks on her neck?
- Yes.

93
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:23,818
Body temperature: 30 °C.
She's been dead a few hours.

94
00:16:23,863 --> 00:16:26,661
- I have to take her away now.
- Wait.

95
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:29,998
Let me look at her
for a bit longer.

96
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:34,964
Siboldi, clear the area.

97
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:37,669
Move away, please!

98
00:16:56,796 --> 00:16:58,957
Take the jacket off.

99
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:21,115
Where does this Mario live?

100
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:26,090
Down there, over the hill,
but we'd better take the car.

101
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,117
All right, let's go.

102
00:17:30,363 --> 00:17:34,026
Inspector, Mario's a screwball,
but he wouldn't hurt a fly.

103
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:36,227
You've told me.
I know he's your friend.

104
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:37,565
He's everyone's friend.

105
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:39,662
Okay,
but I want a word with him.

106
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:40,899
- Can I?
- Of course.

107
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,500
Good.

108
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:48,036
Alfredo, go into town,
get some info on the girl.

109
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,039
Where she lived, with whom,
who saw her last...

110
00:17:55,054 --> 00:17:57,079
Here's the law.

111
00:17:57,123 --> 00:17:59,216
Wait a minute.

112
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:01,783
Everything okay?

113
00:18:01,827 --> 00:18:04,853
You need to have guts
to do this job.

114
00:18:04,897 --> 00:18:06,922
I don't,
not at the moment.

115
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:09,901
I'm going.
Alfredo will help you.

116
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:13,598
Alfredo, your trusted assistant.
I'll go talk to him.

117
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:16,130
He's heading into town.
If you hurry, you'll catch him.

118
00:18:16,175 --> 00:18:18,439
Okay.

119
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:25,179
You see that man?

120
00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:27,981
If you keep lying,
he'll lock you up.

121
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,215
- Not locked up!
- He will!

122
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:32,918
- Go easy, Siboldi.
- I don't want to be locked up.

123
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,688
No, Mario.
Don't worry.

124
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:38,720
But we need your help.

125
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,661
Tell me why you're so scared.

126
00:18:44,737 --> 00:18:47,297
What are you scared of?

127
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:49,307
Is it something you saw
at the lake?

128
00:18:49,341 --> 00:18:51,673
Are you scared of me?

129
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,372
Of your father?

130
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:57,280
Please, leave me alone
with Mario.

131
00:18:57,316 --> 00:18:59,341
- Why?
- Just for a few minutes.

132
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:01,478
- But why?
- I don't need to explain.

133
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,421
Don't you?
Won't you explain?

134
00:19:04,457 --> 00:19:07,688
You just waltz in here...
like it's your house!

135
00:19:07,726 --> 00:19:11,127
No need to shout.
I'm not deaf.

136
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:15,131
Who are you,
an inspector?

137
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:17,965
I'm just doing my job.

138
00:19:18,003 --> 00:19:20,096
Keep this dog away.

139
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:21,970
If he attacks me,
I'll shoot him!

140
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:23,634
Be good.

141
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:27,373
Please, go into the other room.
Come on, Siboldi!

142
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:29,779
Come with me.

143
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:34,149
- Need a hand?
- No, I don't need any help.

144
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:41,290
So, Mario,

145
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:44,490
that girl you saw at the lake,

146
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,523
was she lying like that,
or did you move her?

147
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:50,159
She was like that.

148
00:19:50,202 --> 00:19:51,931
You didn't touch her?

149
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:58,702
Where did you touch her?

150
00:19:58,744 --> 00:20:00,678
- Here.
- Why?

151
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:03,546
To talk to her.

152
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:06,312
I asked her if she was sleeping, but she
didn't reply,

153
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:09,048
so I whispered in her ear, quietly.

154
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:10,578
What did you say?

155
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,888
That she shouldn't have swum
in the lake

156
00:20:13,926 --> 00:20:15,917
because
this is the season of the snake.

157
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:19,522
The snake
looked her in the eyes,

158
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:23,092
cast its spell,
and put her to sleep.

159
00:20:29,475 --> 00:20:32,933
How do you know
the snake looked at her?

160
00:20:32,978 --> 00:20:36,277
Because she was under a spell.

161
00:20:40,386 --> 00:20:42,877
Why did you put your jacket
over her?

162
00:20:44,356 --> 00:20:47,621
I thought she was cold.
My jacket's very warm.

163
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,790
Mario, that girl's dead.

164
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:56,133
That's a bit soon.

165
00:20:56,168 --> 00:20:58,432
I agree.

166
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,461
Did you know her well?

167
00:21:00,506 --> 00:21:05,375
Yes, she used to pass by here
when she went running.

168
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:08,972
I was there when she won
the hockey medal.

169
00:21:09,014 --> 00:21:12,415
- Were you fond of her?
- Yes, quite a bit.

170
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:14,749
How much?

171
00:21:14,787 --> 00:21:18,416
I always wanted her to win.

172
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,924
Apart from you,
who else was fond of her?

173
00:21:23,963 --> 00:21:28,798
- Her father.
- Of course, her dad.

174
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:32,201
- And apart from her dad?
- Everyone.

175
00:21:32,237 --> 00:21:36,037
- No one disliked her?
- No.

176
00:21:36,075 --> 00:21:37,770
You're sure?

177
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,508
If I tell you,
what'll you do?

178
00:21:46,552 --> 00:21:51,387
Nothing.
It'll be our secret.

179
00:21:57,529 --> 00:21:59,793
My father hates her

180
00:21:59,832 --> 00:22:04,496
because Anna
has long, slim legs.

181
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:07,505
Instead he...

182
00:22:12,177 --> 00:22:16,011
Anna had an older boyfriend,
Roberto Biasutti.

183
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:18,846
He works in a factory near here.

184
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:21,546
The girl's father
is Davide Nadאl.

185
00:22:21,587 --> 00:22:23,077
He's a widower.

186
00:22:23,122 --> 00:22:25,283
He went to visit
his brother in Tarvisio today.

187
00:22:25,324 --> 00:22:28,760
He has another daughter,
Silvia, a student.

188
00:22:28,794 --> 00:22:31,592
She's trying to get hold of him.

189
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:34,390
Yes, thanks.

190
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:37,800
The Mayor is letting us use
some spare rooms.

191
00:22:37,836 --> 00:22:40,896
Roberto lives with his mom.
She's a housekeeper.

192
00:22:40,939 --> 00:22:44,102
- And his father?
- There's never been a father.

193
00:22:44,143 --> 00:22:46,077
Never been a father...

194
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:48,443
There's always a father.

195
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,614
Anna was the only decent thing.

196
00:22:57,656 --> 00:22:59,647
The only one.

197
00:23:02,695 --> 00:23:05,186
If you don't feel like talking,
we can come back.

198
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,289
No, I'm all right.

199
00:23:07,332 --> 00:23:10,392
You want some water?

200
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:12,427
Something stronger?

201
00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:16,406
I don't want anything.

202
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:21,242
Your mom told me
you stayed home all day today.

203
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,147
- I didn't go to work.
- Why?

204
00:23:24,183 --> 00:23:27,846
It's no fun working
in the factory.

205
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:31,049
I call in sick
every now and then.

206
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,752
When did you last see Anna?

207
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,228
This morning.

208
00:23:37,262 --> 00:23:38,752
This morning?

209
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:40,958
At what time?

210
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:44,799
I left her house
just before 8:00.

211
00:23:48,373 --> 00:23:50,671
Were you having sex?

212
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:53,337
- Why do you ask?
- I need to know.

213
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:58,611
That's private.
Isn't there a law on privacy?

214
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,641
Yes, but there's been a murder.

215
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:05,854
Well?

216
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:08,553
Of course
we were having sex.

217
00:24:08,594 --> 00:24:12,587
I won't be back tonight.
Can you stay at Agnese's?

218
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:17,894
I'd rather you stayed
with Agnese.

219
00:24:19,938 --> 00:24:22,532
All right, bye.

220
00:24:29,548 --> 00:24:32,176
We've talked
to her neighbors.

221
00:24:32,217 --> 00:24:34,777
She went out at about 8:00,
as usual.

222
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,720
There's a man outside
who met her in town.

223
00:24:36,755 --> 00:24:39,383
- Who is he?
- Corrado Canali, a local.

224
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,517
He has a shop in Udine.

225
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,620
But his wife runs it now.
They split up...

226
00:24:44,663 --> 00:24:47,029
- Fine, show him in.
- Yes.

227
00:24:53,939 --> 00:24:56,100
- May I?
- Come in.

228
00:24:57,509 --> 00:25:00,569
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

229
00:25:00,612 --> 00:25:04,013
I just heard about Anna.
It's awful.

230
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:05,573
I knew her well.

231
00:25:05,617 --> 00:25:09,383
She was Angelo's babysitter,
my son.

232
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:11,946
- Where did you see her today?
- Outside the coffee shop.

233
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,788
She was going in,
and I offered her a coffee.

234
00:25:14,827 --> 00:25:17,523
- Did she accept?
- No, she had to go.

235
00:25:17,563 --> 00:25:20,191
- Did she say where?
- No.

236
00:25:27,606 --> 00:25:29,005
That's all for now,

237
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:32,169
but as I've told everyone,
don't leave town.

238
00:25:32,211 --> 00:25:34,839
We may need
to speak to you again.

239
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,609
All right.

240
00:25:36,648 --> 00:25:39,139
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

241
00:25:42,221 --> 00:25:45,054
Is there anything
that didn't belong to her?

242
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,025
No, it's all hers.

243
00:25:50,395 --> 00:25:55,128
I don't want to identify her.
I can't do it.

244
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:59,035
Don't worry, Mr. Nadאl.
Your daughter Silvia did it.

245
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:01,869
- She's not my daughter.
- Sorry?

246
00:26:01,907 --> 00:26:06,344
When I met my wife,
she'd just lost her husband.

247
00:26:06,378 --> 00:26:09,404
Silvia was
just over a year old.

248
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:22,020
- Her phone's missing.
- Forensics has it.

249
00:26:24,897 --> 00:26:28,424
Where's her backpack?

250
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:31,459
You're sure
she had it with her?

251
00:26:31,503 --> 00:26:34,165
She had it when she left.

252
00:26:39,411 --> 00:26:41,504
How can someone die like this?

253
00:26:41,546 --> 00:26:45,676
How can this happen?

254
00:26:45,717 --> 00:26:48,185
I want to be able to cry alone.

255
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:53,055
- Not in front of you.
- We won't be long.

256
00:26:53,091 --> 00:26:56,720
What was in Anna's backpack?
It's gone.

257
00:26:56,762 --> 00:27:00,061
The usual, I think,
nothing special.

258
00:27:00,098 --> 00:27:02,089
Did she keep a diary?

259
00:27:03,635 --> 00:27:04,863
I don't know.

260
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:06,598
She wouldn't have told me anyway.

261
00:27:06,638 --> 00:27:07,764
Why not?

262
00:27:07,806 --> 00:27:10,969
Anna was different.

263
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:12,943
She was totally different
from me.

264
00:27:12,978 --> 00:27:15,139
You're beautiful, and Anna?

265
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,445
Didn't you see her?

266
00:27:18,483 --> 00:27:21,008
I did.

267
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:23,544
Didn't you see
how beautiful she was?

268
00:27:23,588 --> 00:27:27,115
Can I go now?
I want to take my dad home.

269
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,459
Would you help us try to find
some clues in Anna's room?

270
00:27:31,496 --> 00:27:33,430
- Now?
- Yes.

271
00:27:33,465 --> 00:27:36,457
- All right.
- Come, Silvia.

272
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:52,380
Can I give something to her dad?
He keeps crying.

273
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:55,682
He keeps saying,
"My little girl!"

274
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:57,655
What can you give him?

275
00:27:57,689 --> 00:27:59,782
Some medicine?

276
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:05,922
What medicine, what medicine...

277
00:28:13,005 --> 00:28:14,996
"My little girl"...

278
00:28:56,114 --> 00:28:58,548
- Whose watch is that?
- Roberto's.

279
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:00,847
They used to swap them occasionally.

280
00:29:00,886 --> 00:29:03,855
They stayed here last night.
Did you see them?

281
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:05,379
No, maybe when
they came upstairs.

282
00:29:05,424 --> 00:29:07,790
I was sleeping.

283
00:29:07,826 --> 00:29:11,455
They met secretly
because my dad hates Roberto.

284
00:29:11,496 --> 00:29:13,691
He says he's a loafer.

285
00:29:13,732 --> 00:29:17,031
- What's Roberto like?
- Like that.

286
00:29:18,136 --> 00:29:19,694
If everyone hated loafers,

287
00:29:19,738 --> 00:29:22,798
we'd have to hate
half the world.

288
00:29:24,543 --> 00:29:26,943
You want some spaghetti?

289
00:29:26,978 --> 00:29:29,276
Whatever's easiest.

290
00:29:35,854 --> 00:29:37,651
You've got a burn?

291
00:29:37,689 --> 00:29:41,147
No, it's atypical dermatitis.

292
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:43,093
What does that mean?

293
00:29:43,128 --> 00:29:45,926
That they don't know the cure.

294
00:30:46,825 --> 00:30:49,817
Come on,
film something else!

295
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:19,888
Come on, Dad.
Stop it.

296
00:31:33,672 --> 00:31:36,800
It's a difficult age.
I'm used to it.

297
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:38,399
Eight months ago,

298
00:31:38,443 --> 00:31:42,436
she told me she didn't want
to compete anymore,

299
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,244
that she only enjoyed
running on the hill,

300
00:31:45,283 --> 00:31:47,683
by herself.

301
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:52,213
"It's not fun by yourself,"
I said jokingly.

302
00:31:52,257 --> 00:31:55,886
- Jokingly?
- Yes, to make her laugh.

303
00:31:55,927 --> 00:31:59,829
- Did she laugh?
- No, she never laughed!

304
00:31:59,864 --> 00:32:02,924
What did you do?
Laugh by yourself?

305
00:32:06,671 --> 00:32:10,232
Maybe you don't understand.

306
00:32:10,275 --> 00:32:13,438
- Did you try it on with Anna?
- Why do you ask?

307
00:32:13,478 --> 00:32:15,036
Did you or didn't you?

308
00:32:16,748 --> 00:32:18,375
If I say yes,
will I be a suspect?

309
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:19,781
You already are.

310
00:32:19,818 --> 00:32:21,649
You've got a record.
You've been sentenced.

311
00:32:21,686 --> 00:32:24,917
Unjustly.
Read the verdict again.

312
00:32:24,956 --> 00:32:27,083
I will.
Now just answer my questions.

313
00:32:29,294 --> 00:32:33,230
Anna was a beautiful girl.

314
00:32:33,265 --> 00:32:35,825
At that time,
she wasn't with Roberto.

315
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:38,062
I thought
we could get it together.

316
00:32:38,103 --> 00:32:41,800
At that time, she was 17.
She was a minor.

317
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,274
Yes, but I didn't want...

318
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:47,574
You're twice her age,
"get it together" how?

319
00:32:47,612 --> 00:32:51,378
We didn't do anything.
We were just friends.

320
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:55,443
Even after she'd left,
she'd come by for a chat.

321
00:32:55,487 --> 00:33:01,426
Ask the others what Anna
was like with me.

322
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:04,189
I enjoy flirting with girls.

323
00:33:04,229 --> 00:33:05,856
She knew that.

324
00:33:05,897 --> 00:33:08,092
I even took her to Udine
about a month ago.

325
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:11,933
- What for?
- To pick up some test results.

326
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:16,236
- She'd missed the bus.
- What were the tests for?

327
00:33:16,274 --> 00:33:19,971
I asked her, but she said
it wasn't any of my business.

328
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:22,445
I thought Roberto
had gotten her pregnant.

329
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,711
But that's how she was.

330
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,217
That's why
I chose her as captain.

331
00:33:27,252 --> 00:33:31,188
- When did you last see her?
- Yesterday morning.

332
00:33:31,222 --> 00:33:34,589
- Where and at what time?
- Near the coffee shop.

333
00:33:34,626 --> 00:33:38,084
I drove past her.
She was with Corrado Canali.

334
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:40,597
Be more precise.
Did she stop him?

335
00:33:40,632 --> 00:33:41,860
Did they meet by chance?

336
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,734
I don't know.
They were talking.

337
00:33:50,275 --> 00:33:53,540
If we had more officers,
I'd have him followed.

338
00:33:53,578 --> 00:33:55,341
- Why?
- Just because.

339
00:33:58,149 --> 00:33:59,741
I went to...

340
00:33:59,784 --> 00:34:03,379
Did you find any medical test results in
her room?

341
00:34:03,421 --> 00:34:06,447
- I don't think so...
- Yes or no?

342
00:34:06,491 --> 00:34:08,220
No.

343
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:14,393
Here are the printouts
we requested.

344
00:34:14,432 --> 00:34:17,492
These are people
who Anna called frequently.

345
00:34:17,535 --> 00:34:19,696
It'll take a few days
for the rest.

346
00:34:31,883 --> 00:34:33,817
They're Persian.

347
00:34:33,852 --> 00:34:36,946
They're from Baluchistan,
southern Iran.

348
00:34:36,988 --> 00:34:38,649
Is it true kids make these?

349
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,988
In some areas, yes.

350
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:42,356
Because
they have small fingers?

351
00:34:42,394 --> 00:34:46,160
Yes, they're better
at knotting.

352
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:50,190
Actually, it's the little girls
who have smaller fingers...

353
00:34:50,235 --> 00:34:51,759
It doesn't matter.

354
00:34:51,803 --> 00:34:54,966
Those are not made by kids, though.

355
00:34:55,006 --> 00:34:57,998
Why didn't you tell me
Anna called you every day,

356
00:34:58,042 --> 00:35:01,136
at any time, day or night?

357
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:02,737
I wanted to.

358
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:03,975
Why didn't you?

359
00:35:04,015 --> 00:35:05,414
You'd have got the wrong idea.

360
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,918
Did you have a relationship?

361
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:10,079
Did you arrange to meet yesterday?

362
00:35:10,121 --> 00:35:11,349
No.

363
00:35:11,389 --> 00:35:14,950
I told you.
I just bumped into her.

364
00:35:14,993 --> 00:35:19,692
She had a sort of crush.

365
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:22,632
She thought
she was in love with me.

366
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:25,192
She knew I was sad
after I left my wife,

367
00:35:25,236 --> 00:35:28,069
so she'd call me.

368
00:35:28,106 --> 00:35:32,941
You can't have any secrets
in a town like this.

369
00:35:32,977 --> 00:35:35,411
Everyone knows your business.

370
00:35:35,447 --> 00:35:39,042
Ask around.
You'll see it's true.

371
00:35:59,204 --> 00:36:01,764
Alfredo and I
are going back to the city.

372
00:36:01,806 --> 00:36:05,173
I need to sleep.
I'm exhausted.

373
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:07,201
Good night, sir.

374
00:36:08,746 --> 00:36:10,077
Bye.

375
00:36:29,534 --> 00:36:32,970
Getting a D in History is worse than
getting an F in Latin.

376
00:36:39,344 --> 00:36:41,676
What's that on your arm?

377
00:36:41,713 --> 00:36:44,409
Atypical dermatitis.

378
00:36:44,449 --> 00:36:46,349
I've had it for a month.

379
00:36:47,986 --> 00:36:51,046
24 absences in a term
are a bit much.

380
00:36:52,557 --> 00:36:54,422
I don't feel like
studying lately,

381
00:36:54,459 --> 00:36:55,824
so I skip school.

382
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,157
Everyone does.

383
00:36:57,195 --> 00:36:58,924
You have to copy
everyone else?

384
00:36:58,963 --> 00:37:02,057
Yes.

385
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,864
- Where do you go instead?
- Around.

386
00:37:04,903 --> 00:37:07,394
- Around?
- I'll be late.

387
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:12,535
Francesca,
who do you go around with?

388
00:37:12,577 --> 00:37:14,101
I go by myself.

389
00:37:14,145 --> 00:37:17,945
Finished with the third degree?

390
00:37:17,982 --> 00:37:22,442
- Make sure you go today.
- Bye, Dad.

391
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:30,992
Prosecutor Giani asked me
lots of questions.

392
00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:33,054
She doesn't understand
how we ended up here

393
00:37:33,097 --> 00:37:34,496
after 20 years in homicide.

394
00:37:34,532 --> 00:37:36,329
What did you say?

395
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:39,393
"For me and the Inspector,
all places are the same."

396
00:37:39,437 --> 00:37:42,964
That's a good answer.

397
00:37:47,478 --> 00:37:51,312
What did you think
when you saw her that day?

398
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:54,045
She looked
like she was sleeping.

399
00:37:54,085 --> 00:37:58,954
Why go to all that trouble
to put her in that position?

400
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:02,118
Put the criminal part
of your mind to work.

401
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:07,690
It's too hard.

402
00:38:07,732 --> 00:38:09,199
I don't know.

403
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:12,225
I thought...
that they'd undressed her

404
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,034
to make it look
like a sexual crime.

405
00:38:15,073 --> 00:38:17,633
Perhaps.

406
00:38:17,675 --> 00:38:22,476
But then they couldn't just leave her lying
in the mud,

407
00:38:22,513 --> 00:38:26,813
so they placed her on her side,
as if she was asleep.

408
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:30,651
They wanted it to look peaceful.

409
00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:34,280
Then they glanced back

410
00:38:34,325 --> 00:38:37,488
and saw Anna's eyes
watching them.

411
00:38:37,528 --> 00:38:40,986
They thought that image
would torment them forever,

412
00:38:41,032 --> 00:38:47,028
so they went back
and turned her head.

413
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,777
There are sentiments involved.

414
00:38:55,813 --> 00:39:00,307
Whoever put her in that position
was fond of her.

415
00:39:33,384 --> 00:39:36,353
They're beautiful.
Carlo will love them.

416
00:39:36,387 --> 00:39:37,979
You're so kind.

417
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:39,853
It wasn't my idea.

418
00:39:39,891 --> 00:39:42,485
They're from Francesca.

419
00:39:44,495 --> 00:39:46,588
Francesca?

420
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:55,200
You see, right now,
I'm a bit confused.

421
00:39:59,811 --> 00:40:05,078
Is she someone
I should know?

422
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:08,574
Is it important?

423
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:12,316
No, not at all.

424
00:40:14,392 --> 00:40:17,156
Carlo had to go home.

425
00:40:17,195 --> 00:40:18,992
It was awful.

426
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:21,658
The doctors said
he'll be back soon.

427
00:40:21,699 --> 00:40:24,725
They promised.

428
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:28,398
- You miss him?
- A lot.

429
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:34,071
When he's here,
I don't feel alone in the world.

430
00:40:34,112 --> 00:40:36,672
Of course, there's you too.

431
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:40,946
It's sweet of you
to come all this way.

432
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:43,317
Taking those early flights,

433
00:40:43,354 --> 00:40:45,379
leaving your students,
your wife.

434
00:40:45,423 --> 00:40:47,220
You're very kind.

435
00:40:47,258 --> 00:40:50,591
It's just that Carlo

436
00:40:50,628 --> 00:40:53,654
makes that feeling I have
go away,

437
00:40:53,698 --> 00:40:55,188
that feeling of sadness.

438
00:40:55,233 --> 00:40:57,064
He tells me
I'm beautiful.

439
00:40:57,101 --> 00:40:58,625
I know it's not true,

440
00:40:58,669 --> 00:41:02,628
but I could cry with joy
when he tells me.

441
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:06,806
That's enough about me.

442
00:41:06,844 --> 00:41:09,540
Tell me your secrets.

443
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:13,846
What secrets?
I have none.

444
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:19,221
Some time ago, I noticed
you kept a gun in your drawer.

445
00:41:19,257 --> 00:41:22,818
I don't remember
where we were.

446
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:26,318
At the beach house?

447
00:41:26,364 --> 00:41:27,888
I don't know.

448
00:41:27,932 --> 00:41:30,025
So I thought,

449
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:33,332
"Why does
an English literature professor

450
00:41:33,371 --> 00:41:35,464
have a gun in his drawer?"

451
00:41:35,506 --> 00:41:37,872
Isn't that a secret?

452
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:45,078
How's your wife?

453
00:41:45,116 --> 00:41:48,176
Worse.

454
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:51,985
The doctors warned me
she'd get worse.

455
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:58,495
She thought I was her brother
from abroad.

456
00:41:58,529 --> 00:42:00,724
She no longer remembers
she has a daughter.

457
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,996
How can I explain that
to Francesca?

458
00:42:28,492 --> 00:42:31,325
Inspector,
I've got the search warrant

459
00:42:31,362 --> 00:42:32,556
for Roberto's house.

460
00:42:32,597 --> 00:42:35,657
I'm going.

461
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,260
I'll come
as soon as I'm done here.

462
00:42:38,302 --> 00:42:40,065
See you later.

463
00:42:45,409 --> 00:42:48,867
The girl knew the murderer.

464
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:51,848
She trusted him.

465
00:42:51,883 --> 00:42:53,748
Was she raped?

466
00:42:53,784 --> 00:42:57,948
No, she was a virgin.

467
00:42:57,989 --> 00:43:01,356
- You're sure?
- She'd never had sex.

468
00:43:01,392 --> 00:43:03,326
How was she killed?

469
00:43:03,361 --> 00:43:05,420
He held her head underwater.

470
00:43:05,463 --> 00:43:07,795
She has marks on her neck.

471
00:43:07,832 --> 00:43:10,130
How long does it take to die
like that?

472
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:11,225
Anna was an athlete.

473
00:43:11,269 --> 00:43:13,396
She had
an excellent lung capacity,

474
00:43:13,437 --> 00:43:16,838
at least seven or eight minutes.

475
00:43:16,874 --> 00:43:18,603
My God!

476
00:43:18,643 --> 00:43:20,804
No traces of skin
under her nails.

477
00:43:20,845 --> 00:43:23,143
She didn't try to scratch.

478
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,239
It didn't take
much effort to kill her.

479
00:43:25,283 --> 00:43:27,274
Could it have been a woman?

480
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:28,842
It's possible.

481
00:43:28,886 --> 00:43:31,616
Yet Anna was strong.

482
00:43:31,656 --> 00:43:34,784
Yes, but she didn't fight back.
She let herself die.

483
00:43:34,825 --> 00:43:40,593
Maybe Anna was in agreement
with her killer.

484
00:43:40,631 --> 00:43:43,395
That's not possible!

485
00:43:43,434 --> 00:43:47,268
She was so full of life!

486
00:43:47,305 --> 00:43:49,603
Anna was ill.

487
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,632
She had a brain tumor.

488
00:43:54,312 --> 00:43:56,906
- Was it treatable?
- I don't think so.

489
00:43:56,948 --> 00:44:01,044
She had at most a year to live.

490
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:20,937
When will I get
my daughter back?

491
00:44:20,972 --> 00:44:23,133
Soon, very soon.

492
00:44:23,174 --> 00:44:28,111
I need to know.
Why won't you tell me?

493
00:44:29,347 --> 00:44:32,407
I need to organize her funeral.

494
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:36,284
Her relatives are waiting.
What shall I tell them?

495
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,811
Tell them in two days.

496
00:44:38,856 --> 00:44:40,380
You swear?

497
00:44:40,424 --> 00:44:43,552
Yes.

498
00:44:47,198 --> 00:44:53,194
Listen, that doctor came
and sat down here just like you.

499
00:44:53,237 --> 00:44:57,196
He asked me what medicines
Anna was taking.

500
00:44:57,241 --> 00:45:00,210
- Why is he asking me that?
- Listen...

501
00:45:00,244 --> 00:45:03,270
Statements have to be accurate.

502
00:45:03,314 --> 00:45:05,441
Maybe she just had headaches.

503
00:45:05,483 --> 00:45:07,917
Of course,
like everyone.

504
00:45:07,952 --> 00:45:11,080
What's that got to do with it?

505
00:45:11,122 --> 00:45:13,283
We're asking these questions

506
00:45:13,324 --> 00:45:16,384
because there's something
we don't understand.

507
00:45:16,427 --> 00:45:18,918
Why did Anna give up hockey?

508
00:45:18,963 --> 00:45:20,931
She was a strong girl.

509
00:45:20,965 --> 00:45:23,900
Maybe she wasn't well,
maybe there was something wrong.

510
00:45:23,934 --> 00:45:25,799
No...

511
00:45:25,836 --> 00:45:31,797
Anna left the team
after that little boy died.

512
00:45:31,842 --> 00:45:33,139
What boy?

513
00:45:33,177 --> 00:45:37,273
Angelo,
Chiara and Corrado Canali's son.

514
00:45:37,314 --> 00:45:41,182
The one she babysat?

515
00:45:41,218 --> 00:45:44,619
He was three years old.

516
00:45:44,655 --> 00:45:48,091
After that,
Anna cried for a whole week.

517
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:51,686
And that's why
she stopped playing.

518
00:45:51,729 --> 00:45:55,631
If there'd been something else,
she'd have told me.

519
00:45:55,666 --> 00:45:58,567
You're sure Anna
told you everything?

520
00:46:00,571 --> 00:46:02,539
I'm her father.
I knew her.

521
00:46:02,573 --> 00:46:04,871
- Do you have kids?
- A daughter.

522
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:08,072
Don't you know
what goes through her mind?

523
00:46:35,106 --> 00:46:37,404
You didn't go to work today either.

524
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:41,639
Mom, please!
Don't you start too!

525
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:44,079
You know what's happened, right?

526
00:46:44,115 --> 00:46:46,481
Yes, but they'll pretend
they don't know.

527
00:46:46,517 --> 00:46:49,486
If you don't go in tomorrow,
they'll fire you!

528
00:46:57,094 --> 00:47:00,359
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

529
00:47:10,441 --> 00:47:12,875
What are these?

530
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:14,377
Anna gave them to me.

531
00:47:14,411 --> 00:47:16,641
She didn't want them
at her house.

532
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,545
You didn't ask me for them.

533
00:47:18,582 --> 00:47:21,608
You think we're stupid?

534
00:47:21,652 --> 00:47:23,347
If you'd said you wanted
medical tests,

535
00:47:23,387 --> 00:47:28,552
I'd have given you them
and avoided this mess.

536
00:47:28,592 --> 00:47:31,220
We'll tidy up.

537
00:47:31,262 --> 00:47:34,425
I'm taking these too.

538
00:47:34,465 --> 00:47:35,989
Those are Anna's.

539
00:47:36,033 --> 00:47:38,900
Something else
you didn't tell us about.

540
00:47:38,936 --> 00:47:41,632
You can explain it
to the Inspector.

541
00:47:43,607 --> 00:47:46,235
I'm shaking all over.

542
00:47:47,611 --> 00:47:50,546
Inspector, can you come?
It's just for a minute.

543
00:47:50,581 --> 00:47:52,845
It's there.
We haven't touched it.

544
00:47:57,788 --> 00:47:59,619
Seen this before?

545
00:48:02,393 --> 00:48:04,793
- It's Anna's.
- I know.

546
00:48:08,065 --> 00:48:12,126
- Where was it?
- Outside.

547
00:48:12,169 --> 00:48:14,763
No, that's not true.

548
00:48:14,805 --> 00:48:17,330
- You have to come with us.
- Why?

549
00:48:17,374 --> 00:48:19,365
Because I said so.

550
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:22,906
What do you want from me?

551
00:48:22,947 --> 00:48:26,610
You want to frame me?
It wasn't me.

552
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,676
- What did you do, Roberto?
- Mom, please!

553
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,951
Roberto!

554
00:49:07,725 --> 00:49:10,387
And now what?

555
00:49:16,433 --> 00:49:20,392
He had Anna's medical tests
and her backpack.

556
00:49:20,437 --> 00:49:24,134
I wanted to arrest him,
but the shit ran away.

557
00:49:24,174 --> 00:49:26,768
He knocked Binacci down.
He's a new recruit.

558
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:28,971
But you're not!

559
00:49:29,013 --> 00:49:30,844
Did you want me to shoot him?

560
00:49:30,881 --> 00:49:33,281
He went down there.

561
00:49:33,317 --> 00:49:34,944
- What's down there?
- The river.

562
00:49:34,985 --> 00:49:38,182
I've called the patrol cars.
He won't get away.

563
00:50:28,872 --> 00:50:32,672
- Where the fuck are you going?
- Go easy, Siboldi.

564
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:35,178
I didn't do it!
It wasn't me!

565
00:50:35,212 --> 00:50:39,706
I'm not the one you're after.
You have to believe me!

566
00:50:40,451 --> 00:50:43,682
I loved Anna!
I didn't do it!

567
00:50:43,721 --> 00:50:46,986
- So why run away?
- Take him away.

568
00:50:47,024 --> 00:50:49,515
- I nearly had a heart attack.
- That's enough!

569
00:50:51,161 --> 00:50:53,857
Come,
before it gets cold.

570
00:50:53,897 --> 00:50:55,421
I'm coming.

571
00:51:00,738 --> 00:51:04,834
- What's this?
- Reheated soup.

572
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:07,742
You should've said
you'd be back.

573
00:51:12,449 --> 00:51:15,418
- Her name was Anna, right?
- Yes.

574
00:51:15,452 --> 00:51:18,853
Was she beautiful?

575
00:51:18,889 --> 00:51:21,084
We've arrested her boyfriend.

576
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:25,255
- Was it him?
- Maybe.

577
00:51:25,295 --> 00:51:29,459
- Why would he have done it?
- I don't know yet.

578
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,764
What if it wasn't him?

579
00:51:31,802 --> 00:51:34,771
Not only has she gone,
but he's banged up,

580
00:51:34,805 --> 00:51:39,208
worrying you'll get it wrong
and give him a life sentence.

581
00:51:39,243 --> 00:51:41,939
Don't you ever worry
about being wrong?

582
00:51:41,979 --> 00:51:45,244
All the time.

583
00:51:53,424 --> 00:51:56,393
The soup's fine.
I'm just not hungry.

584
00:52:00,697 --> 00:52:01,994
Francesca...

585
00:52:02,032 --> 00:52:04,466
Why did you give up piano?

586
00:52:04,501 --> 00:52:05,763
Again?

587
00:52:05,803 --> 00:52:09,569
- Your fingers are so long...
- I told you.

588
00:52:09,606 --> 00:52:13,337
- But you never explained why.
- Because I don't know.

589
00:52:13,377 --> 00:52:16,972
- There must be a reason!
- But I don't know it.

590
00:52:17,014 --> 00:52:18,811
I got bored.

591
00:52:18,849 --> 00:52:21,647
I don't get it,
all of a sudden...

592
00:52:21,685 --> 00:52:23,346
Dad, I said I don't know!

593
00:52:31,929 --> 00:52:34,193
Leave it.

594
00:52:34,231 --> 00:52:37,462
- I'll do it.
- Forget it.

595
00:52:42,206 --> 00:52:44,231
Go and eat.
I'll do it.

596
00:52:44,274 --> 00:52:46,708
I've almost finished.

597
00:52:46,743 --> 00:52:48,370
Why do women
always turn their backs

598
00:52:48,412 --> 00:52:51,108
when they argue?

599
00:52:51,148 --> 00:52:53,981
Someone has to explain it to me!

600
00:53:29,419 --> 00:53:33,287
- Did you see her today?
- Yes.

601
00:53:33,323 --> 00:53:35,757
How is she?

602
00:53:35,792 --> 00:53:37,623
Better.

603
00:53:40,097 --> 00:53:43,658
- When can I see her?
- Not yet.

604
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,533
She'll get upset
if she sees you.

605
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:48,094
You'll see her here.

606
00:53:48,138 --> 00:53:51,904
- Here?
- Yes.

607
00:53:51,942 --> 00:53:55,207
Will you bring her home
even if she's not better?

608
00:53:55,245 --> 00:53:57,543
No, I'll bring her back
because she will be better.

609
00:53:57,581 --> 00:54:01,244
You just need to be patient.

610
00:54:01,285 --> 00:54:03,753
Mom will be back,
and we'll all be happier.

611
00:54:11,528 --> 00:54:15,658
You wonder
why I'm angry at you.

612
00:54:15,699 --> 00:54:18,463
You never tell me the truth.

613
00:54:18,502 --> 00:54:21,630
You treat me
like a five-year-old.

614
00:54:21,672 --> 00:54:25,733
There is no cure
for Mom's illness.

615
00:54:25,776 --> 00:54:27,004
What do you know?

616
00:54:27,044 --> 00:54:32,038
I know.
I looked on the internet.

617
00:54:32,082 --> 00:54:36,678
It's progressive.
There's no getting better.

618
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,017
You become a...

619
00:54:38,055 --> 00:54:40,683
Stop.

620
00:54:40,724 --> 00:54:43,989
That's enough.

621
00:54:44,027 --> 00:54:46,461
That's enough.

622
00:54:58,475 --> 00:55:02,935
Why did we come here?

623
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:05,608
Why don't you get a woman?

624
00:55:05,649 --> 00:55:08,174
Just tell me why!

625
00:55:19,296 --> 00:55:22,595
This is the Criminal Code,
Article 575, read it!

626
00:55:22,633 --> 00:55:23,930
It says "homicide."

627
00:55:23,967 --> 00:55:26,128
It's got nothing
to do with me.

628
00:55:26,169 --> 00:55:27,693
I didn't do anything.

629
00:55:27,738 --> 00:55:30,605
Why did you have Anna's CDs?

630
00:55:30,641 --> 00:55:33,007
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

631
00:55:33,043 --> 00:55:35,910
Her computer wasn't working,
so she used mine.

632
00:55:35,946 --> 00:55:38,278
Why did you spend all day
looking at them?

633
00:55:38,315 --> 00:55:41,751
- To see what was on them.
- Why?

634
00:55:41,785 --> 00:55:45,846
To find some clues,
to find out who killed her!

635
00:55:45,889 --> 00:55:49,381
- That's our job.
- Then we're in good hands!

636
00:55:49,426 --> 00:55:52,486
I don't think you understand.

637
00:55:52,529 --> 00:55:54,827
Your situation's serious.

638
00:55:54,865 --> 00:55:57,390
So stop fooling us around.

639
00:55:57,434 --> 00:56:02,098
Stop acting like an ass
and stop being a dickhead.

640
00:56:02,139 --> 00:56:06,200
- I'm telling you the truth.
- Don't take me for a fool!

641
00:56:06,243 --> 00:56:09,110
If you carry on saying

642
00:56:09,146 --> 00:56:12,138
that you didn't know
about her backpack

643
00:56:12,182 --> 00:56:14,650
or what those tests
were about

644
00:56:14,685 --> 00:56:18,314
or that you only found out
after she'd died,

645
00:56:18,355 --> 00:56:22,314
you'll get 30 years!

646
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:26,420
I told you the truth.
You just don't believe me.

647
00:56:26,463 --> 00:56:30,923
You tell me
what the truth is then!

648
00:56:30,967 --> 00:56:33,197
I'll tell you, all right.

649
00:56:39,376 --> 00:56:40,968
Well?

650
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:48,885
What?

651
00:56:48,919 --> 00:56:53,322
- Tell me the truth then.
- I've changed my mind.

652
00:56:53,356 --> 00:56:54,414
Son of a...

653
00:56:55,692 --> 00:56:58,320
Don't insult me!

654
00:56:58,361 --> 00:57:01,091
Or you'll be sorry.

655
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,327
Let's keep calm.

656
00:57:08,538 --> 00:57:10,438
Let's talk about the CDs.

657
00:57:10,474 --> 00:57:13,443
You wanted to erase them.

658
00:57:13,477 --> 00:57:17,470
It's not true.
It's not true...

659
00:57:32,629 --> 00:57:35,962
Could tea be the cause
of this rash?

660
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:38,729
I've thought of everything
but not tea.

661
00:57:44,107 --> 00:57:46,598
You found the password
for the CDs?

662
00:57:46,643 --> 00:57:48,406
Not yet.

663
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:52,171
Was it her boyfriend?

664
00:57:53,517 --> 00:57:55,644
It's very likely.

665
00:57:58,188 --> 00:58:01,316
How did
Corrado Canali's son die?

666
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:04,816
An accident,
it was terrible.

667
00:58:04,861 --> 00:58:07,421
He choked on a biscuit
during breakfast.

668
00:58:07,464 --> 00:58:10,524
When they realized,
it was too late.

669
00:58:13,703 --> 00:58:16,695
Have you noticed

670
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:20,870
that nowadays
pregnant women don't show?

671
00:58:20,911 --> 00:58:23,106
Isn't that better?

672
00:58:24,881 --> 00:58:27,315
No.

673
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:29,215
It's not better.

674
00:58:31,221 --> 00:58:33,621
He says he was home
all day yesterday,

675
00:58:33,657 --> 00:58:35,488
but he can't prove it.

676
00:58:35,525 --> 00:58:39,222
He got a call at about 11:00,
but he didn't answer.

677
00:58:39,262 --> 00:58:43,164
He says he had headphones on
and didn't hear it.

678
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,031
What do you think?

679
00:58:45,068 --> 00:58:47,662
Well, I don't know.

680
00:58:47,704 --> 00:58:51,970
We don't get on.
He doesn't like me.

681
00:58:52,008 --> 00:58:55,967
- I have to get a statement.
- He's all yours.

682
00:58:56,012 --> 00:58:58,412
I saw the video of Anna.

683
00:58:58,448 --> 00:59:01,315
Those shots were pretty sick.

684
00:59:01,351 --> 00:59:04,343
The way the father filmed her,
following her around.

685
00:59:04,387 --> 00:59:06,617
They're all of Anna,
just Anna.

686
00:59:06,656 --> 00:59:09,955
You can hear her sister's there,
but you never see her.

687
00:59:09,993 --> 00:59:12,962
The father ignores her.

688
00:59:12,996 --> 00:59:14,395
Did you get that impression too?

689
00:59:14,431 --> 00:59:15,557
Yes.

690
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,159
- Let's talk to Nadאl again.
- Then what?

691
00:59:18,201 --> 00:59:23,503
We accuse him of loving
his own daughter too much?

692
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:28,034
They say you're married
and have a daughter.

693
00:59:28,078 --> 00:59:30,876
Is your wife pretty?

694
00:59:30,914 --> 00:59:36,352
How did such a grouchy man
find himself a pretty wife?

695
00:59:38,321 --> 00:59:40,619
Maybe I wasn't so grouchy.

696
01:00:12,989 --> 01:00:15,423
Nice, aren't they?

697
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:19,019
They look perfect,
yet each one has a flaw,

698
01:00:19,062 --> 01:00:20,256
an imperfect knot.

699
01:00:20,297 --> 01:00:21,992
Is that intentional?

700
01:00:22,032 --> 01:00:23,090
A Persian poet says,

701
01:00:23,133 --> 01:00:25,966
it's so the goddess of the weave
can free herself.

702
01:00:27,504 --> 01:00:30,701
You didn't come here to talk
about rugs, did you, Inspector?

703
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:32,640
You know me.

704
01:00:32,676 --> 01:00:35,577
Don't be offended,
but I could tell right away.

705
01:00:37,614 --> 01:00:39,707
No offense taken.

706
01:00:39,749 --> 01:00:44,618
She wasn't like other girls
her age.

707
01:00:44,654 --> 01:00:46,554
She was kinder,
more sensible.

708
01:00:46,589 --> 01:00:51,288
She was strong and brave.

709
01:00:51,328 --> 01:00:57,164
Why didn't anyone want
to look after your son?

710
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:01,660
The other girls preferred
looking after normal children.

711
01:01:01,705 --> 01:01:03,798
Wasn't Angelo normal?

712
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:08,209
I thought you wanted
to know about Anna.

713
01:01:08,244 --> 01:01:12,647
I'm just trying
to get the whole picture.

714
01:01:12,682 --> 01:01:16,618
I thought you'd ask me
more routine questions.

715
01:01:18,355 --> 01:01:21,222
- Like if I have an alibi.
- Do you?

716
01:01:21,257 --> 01:01:22,622
No.

717
01:01:22,659 --> 01:01:24,650
You're not the only one.

718
01:01:27,864 --> 01:01:31,265
Angelo was ill.

719
01:01:31,301 --> 01:01:33,132
He was in a world of his own,

720
01:01:33,169 --> 01:01:36,661
constantly battling
with his fears.

721
01:01:36,706 --> 01:01:39,300
The only thing the doctors said

722
01:01:39,342 --> 01:01:43,301
was that he wouldn't
improve with age.

723
01:01:43,346 --> 01:01:47,749
He could never sit still.
He never slept.

724
01:01:47,784 --> 01:01:50,776
He cried all the time,
since he was born.

725
01:01:52,155 --> 01:01:54,248
He'd cry inconsolably.

726
01:01:56,626 --> 01:01:59,527
Angelo was a difficult child.

727
01:01:59,562 --> 01:02:02,190
Only Anna
knew how to handle him.

728
01:02:02,232 --> 01:02:04,666
She was patient.

729
01:02:04,701 --> 01:02:06,760
He'd calm down with her.

730
01:02:06,803 --> 01:02:09,397
He adored her.

731
01:02:09,439 --> 01:02:12,931
I even felt jealous sometimes.

732
01:02:12,976 --> 01:02:16,343
Jealous in what way?

733
01:02:16,379 --> 01:02:19,473
Like all mothers who can't deal
with their kids' problems

734
01:02:19,516 --> 01:02:22,542
and take it out on those
who are better at it.

735
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:32,060
I'll walk you back,
if you like.

736
01:02:56,786 --> 01:02:58,947
Is that your boyfriend?

737
01:02:58,988 --> 01:03:00,353
His name's Simone.

738
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:02,654
Why is he in Canali's shop?

739
01:03:02,692 --> 01:03:06,924
He's a restorer.
He's picking up a check.

740
01:03:06,963 --> 01:03:10,899
- Are you happy with him?
- Some days, I am.

741
01:03:10,934 --> 01:03:12,799
What's happened to you?

742
01:03:12,836 --> 01:03:14,497
The other day,
you were distraught.

743
01:03:14,537 --> 01:03:16,061
Now you look much better.

744
01:03:16,106 --> 01:03:18,666
How come?

745
01:03:18,708 --> 01:03:20,266
I just stay away from pain.

746
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:21,675
That's easy to say.

747
01:03:21,711 --> 01:03:24,179
I left home.
I'm staying with him.

748
01:03:24,214 --> 01:03:27,274
You left your dad alone?

749
01:03:27,317 --> 01:03:30,718
He's alone anyway,
alone with Anna.

750
01:03:30,753 --> 01:03:32,220
And he's not my real dad.

751
01:03:32,255 --> 01:03:34,382
My real dad died.

752
01:03:34,424 --> 01:03:37,291
And those who knew him
say I'm not missing anything.

753
01:03:37,327 --> 01:03:39,761
You can't choose your father.

754
01:03:39,796 --> 01:03:43,129
You just make do
with what you have.

755
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:44,190
That's true.

756
01:03:45,935 --> 01:03:47,926
I have to go.

757
01:03:49,939 --> 01:03:52,032
Among the things
you confiscated,

758
01:03:52,075 --> 01:03:54,669
there's a small bronze angel.

759
01:03:54,711 --> 01:03:57,145
- I'd like it back.
- An angel?

760
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:59,444
Anna was very fond of it.

761
01:03:59,482 --> 01:04:03,509
All right, I'll get it back
as soon as I can.

762
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,862
This is the way Anna
might have taken that morning.

763
01:04:14,898 --> 01:04:18,334
What way
did she go to school?

764
01:04:18,368 --> 01:04:22,361
The bus stop's here.
Her house is there.

765
01:04:22,405 --> 01:04:24,566
So she went this way.

766
01:04:55,071 --> 01:05:00,168
- Why did you lie?
- Still this question?

767
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:03,475
How many times
have you asked me?

768
01:05:03,513 --> 01:05:05,378
Hundreds and thousands?

769
01:05:05,415 --> 01:05:07,508
Why did you lie?

770
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:09,882
I wasn't thinking.

771
01:05:09,919 --> 01:05:12,149
I was embarrassed.

772
01:05:12,188 --> 01:05:17,023
If I told you I slept with Anna
without having sex,

773
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:21,087
you'd think I was mad.

774
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:25,157
I'm not mad.
I have no sexual hang-ups.

775
01:05:25,201 --> 01:05:27,726
What would my motive be?

776
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:30,136
Why would I kill her?

777
01:05:31,841 --> 01:05:34,207
Anna and I
cared about each other.

778
01:05:34,244 --> 01:05:38,647
Why would I kill her?

779
01:05:38,681 --> 01:05:42,481
Listen to me.

780
01:05:42,518 --> 01:05:45,078
You don't know this,
but I do.

781
01:05:45,121 --> 01:05:49,615
Murder victims are usually found
in awkward positions.

782
01:05:49,659 --> 01:05:51,718
Anna wasn't.

783
01:05:54,564 --> 01:05:58,125
It's as if death freed her
from suffering.

784
01:05:58,167 --> 01:06:00,829
That's why we thought of you.

785
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:02,599
What do you mean?

786
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:04,903
Anna told you that
she didn't have long to live.

787
01:06:04,941 --> 01:06:06,465
Maybe you cried together,

788
01:06:06,509 --> 01:06:10,411
and you asked her
to die together.

789
01:06:10,446 --> 01:06:13,313
But she asked you to avoid
doctors and clinics,

790
01:06:13,349 --> 01:06:17,308
to let her die in silence,
without bothering anyone,

791
01:06:17,353 --> 01:06:19,184
and you did that.

792
01:06:19,222 --> 01:06:21,349
That's not true.

793
01:06:21,391 --> 01:06:25,157
I only found out
she was ill yesterday.

794
01:06:33,102 --> 01:06:36,265
I told her everything.

795
01:06:36,306 --> 01:06:38,866
And she told me nothing.

796
01:06:43,346 --> 01:06:45,541
His provisional arrest
needs validating.

797
01:06:45,581 --> 01:06:47,412
Did you hear that?

798
01:06:49,285 --> 01:06:51,617
I'm talking to you.

799
01:06:51,654 --> 01:06:55,112
You're under arrest.
Do you have anything to say?

800
01:06:55,158 --> 01:06:56,284
Fuck off.

801
01:06:56,326 --> 01:06:57,987
Good lad.

802
01:07:16,112 --> 01:07:18,103
We've unblocked the CDs.

803
01:07:32,695 --> 01:07:35,721
Print what's on them.
I want to read it all.

804
01:07:39,001 --> 01:07:41,333
What was the password?

805
01:07:41,371 --> 01:07:42,395
"Angelo."

806
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:17,200
Inspector,
you can't smoke here.

807
01:08:21,244 --> 01:08:23,576
Arrest me.

808
01:08:45,601 --> 01:08:48,126
"My angel"

809
01:09:10,526 --> 01:09:14,519
"School's just started,
and I'm exhausted already!

810
01:09:14,564 --> 01:09:16,657
"Sometimes I wish
they'd understand me,

811
01:09:16,699 --> 01:09:18,360
"that with just a glance,

812
01:09:18,401 --> 01:09:23,600
"they'd understand
my melancholy...

813
01:09:23,639 --> 01:09:26,574
"I need to realize
we're growing up

814
01:09:26,609 --> 01:09:30,511
"and each of us is trying
to find our own identity.

815
01:09:30,546 --> 01:09:33,014
"I fell asleep in class today.

816
01:09:33,049 --> 01:09:35,279
"It wasn't the first time.

817
01:09:35,318 --> 01:09:37,980
"I get overcome by exhaustion...

818
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:43,117
"I think your eye color
depends on your life.

819
01:09:43,159 --> 01:09:45,753
"If someone's happy,
their eyes are bright.

820
01:09:45,795 --> 01:09:50,459
"I imagined Angelo,
all grown-up and unshaven.

821
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:56,496
"He'll be hot with the girls,
and I'll be very jealous.

822
01:09:56,539 --> 01:09:58,234
"I wish certain days
didn't exist,

823
01:09:58,274 --> 01:10:01,004
"that they'd never existed.

824
01:10:01,043 --> 01:10:06,879
"Everyone should express themselves in
their own way.

825
01:10:06,916 --> 01:10:08,816
"Sometimes the team commitments
are draining,

826
01:10:08,851 --> 01:10:12,548
but taking part
means a lot to me."

827
01:10:17,527 --> 01:10:21,258
"When I go running on the hill
and head down to the lake,

828
01:10:21,297 --> 01:10:25,324
"I always feel
Mario is watching me.

829
01:10:25,368 --> 01:10:30,101
"He has kind eyes, but his dad's
stern expression scares me.

830
01:10:30,139 --> 01:10:32,607
"His wife left him...

831
01:10:32,642 --> 01:10:34,769
"Sometimes,
I'm just like my dad.

832
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:36,801
"I struggle to accept
I'm growing up

833
01:10:36,846 --> 01:10:39,212
and that
I'm changing so much."

834
01:10:59,635 --> 01:11:02,103
"When I go running on the hill
and head down to the lake,

835
01:11:02,138 --> 01:11:05,767
"I always feel
Mario is watching me.

836
01:11:05,808 --> 01:11:10,268
I'm not scared, but his dad
gives me the creeps."

837
01:12:29,258 --> 01:12:31,158
What are you doing?

838
01:12:31,193 --> 01:12:33,627
I'm digging a grave
for Hercules.

839
01:12:33,663 --> 01:12:36,325
Dad says
he died of old age,

840
01:12:36,365 --> 01:12:42,270
but if he poisoned him,
I'll smash his head in.

841
01:12:42,304 --> 01:12:44,204
I know...

842
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:47,368
I shouldn't say that
about my dad, but I...

843
01:12:47,410 --> 01:12:48,672
Where is he?

844
01:12:48,711 --> 01:12:52,044
Where he always is,
damn him!

845
01:12:59,955 --> 01:13:02,446
- I want a lawyer.
- You'll need one in court.

846
01:13:02,491 --> 01:13:04,288
Answer my questions.

847
01:13:04,326 --> 01:13:07,193
- You can't treat me as if...
- I'm not.

848
01:13:07,229 --> 01:13:10,630
You're intimidating me
because I'm in a wheelchair...

849
01:13:10,666 --> 01:13:12,361
Answer my questions!

850
01:13:12,401 --> 01:13:15,893
Or would you
rather do it in a cell?

851
01:13:15,938 --> 01:13:19,965
What can you do unaided?
Can you walk?

852
01:13:20,009 --> 01:13:21,943
Can you drive your truck?

853
01:13:21,977 --> 01:13:23,638
I can,
but I don't.

854
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:27,581
Why are the commands
on the steering wheel then?

855
01:13:27,616 --> 01:13:31,746
I used to drive it
ten years ago.

856
01:13:33,856 --> 01:13:35,915
- Squeeze my arm.
- What?

857
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:37,823
- Squeeze it.
- Why?

858
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:39,691
Just do as I say!

859
01:13:41,163 --> 01:13:43,427
Harder.

860
01:13:43,466 --> 01:13:45,400
Harder.

861
01:13:45,434 --> 01:13:49,063
Squeeze it harder.

862
01:13:49,105 --> 01:13:51,096
All right, that'll do.

863
01:13:52,808 --> 01:13:55,777
Are you seeing
if I'm strong enough

864
01:13:55,811 --> 01:13:57,904
to break a rabbit's neck?

865
01:13:57,947 --> 01:14:01,940
No, if you could drown a girl.

866
01:14:01,984 --> 01:14:04,111
- Me?
- Yes, you.

867
01:14:04,153 --> 01:14:07,020
- Why would I do that?
- I don't know.

868
01:14:07,056 --> 01:14:09,047
So you wouldn't
see her running by?

869
01:14:09,091 --> 01:14:12,288
So Mario wouldn't look at her?

870
01:14:12,328 --> 01:14:17,265
You hate Mario,
don't you?

871
01:14:17,299 --> 01:14:19,529
I hated him when he was a boy
but not now.

872
01:14:19,568 --> 01:14:21,263
He keeps me company.

873
01:14:21,303 --> 01:14:24,136
It's just the two of us up here,

874
01:14:24,173 --> 01:14:26,141
a paralytic old man
and a weirdo.

875
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:28,871
Why did you hate him?

876
01:14:28,911 --> 01:14:31,675
You wouldn't understand.

877
01:14:31,714 --> 01:14:34,774
Your children are probably healthy and
intelligent.

878
01:14:34,817 --> 01:14:38,480
- Try.
- I can't.

879
01:14:38,521 --> 01:14:41,718
I can't explain.

880
01:14:41,757 --> 01:14:43,850
You hate yourself.

881
01:14:43,893 --> 01:14:46,555
You think it's your fault.

882
01:14:46,595 --> 01:14:49,428
Everything becomes black.

883
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:55,869
You can only understand
if you've been through it!

884
01:17:08,103 --> 01:17:12,540
If this is about Anna again,
I've nothing to add.

885
01:17:12,574 --> 01:17:16,203
It's not about Anna.
It's about Angelo.

886
01:17:16,245 --> 01:17:17,735
Why?

887
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:21,443
If you don't feel like it now, I'll come
back tomorrow.

888
01:17:21,483 --> 01:17:23,815
What's Angelo got to do
with Anna's death?

889
01:17:23,852 --> 01:17:26,116
I don't know.

890
01:17:26,155 --> 01:17:30,091
Ask me what you want,
then go.

891
01:17:36,732 --> 01:17:40,793
Did you split up
because he died?

892
01:17:40,836 --> 01:17:43,532
We couldn't cope with the loss,

893
01:17:43,572 --> 01:17:47,565
with the guilt.

894
01:17:47,609 --> 01:17:51,272
It was worse for Corrado.

895
01:17:51,313 --> 01:17:55,545
Angelo was with him that day.

896
01:17:55,584 --> 01:17:59,918
After months of tears, pain, madness,

897
01:17:59,955 --> 01:18:03,550
we went our separate ways.

898
01:18:05,961 --> 01:18:08,122
How did Angelo die?

899
01:18:12,468 --> 01:18:19,636
He was having biscuits and milk when he
choked.

900
01:18:19,675 --> 01:18:23,338
Something was stuck
in his throat.

901
01:18:23,379 --> 01:18:26,109
He suffocated.

902
01:18:26,148 --> 01:18:28,309
He couldn't shout.

903
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:33,847
What do you remember
about that day?

904
01:18:33,889 --> 01:18:36,221
Everything.

905
01:18:39,895 --> 01:18:41,294
I was in bed.

906
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:46,267
I hadn't slept all night
because Angelo had been up.

907
01:18:46,301 --> 01:18:49,361
He cried till
5:00 in the morning.

908
01:18:49,405 --> 01:18:52,135
Then he fell asleep,

909
01:18:52,174 --> 01:18:56,008
but two hours later,
he was up again.

910
01:18:56,045 --> 01:18:59,310
I couldn't take it anymore.
I was exhausted.

911
01:18:59,348 --> 01:19:01,373
So Corrado went to him.

912
01:19:03,118 --> 01:19:05,052
You stayed in bed?

913
01:19:05,087 --> 01:19:06,714
Yes.

914
01:19:06,755 --> 01:19:09,223
Were you sleeping?

915
01:19:09,258 --> 01:19:12,989
Sort of.

916
01:19:13,028 --> 01:19:15,553
Did you hear anything?

917
01:19:18,901 --> 01:19:23,235
Their voices
as they had breakfast.

918
01:19:23,272 --> 01:19:25,604
Nothing out of the ordinary?

919
01:19:30,112 --> 01:19:35,812
Just Angelo screaming.

920
01:19:35,851 --> 01:19:38,718
Angelo was screaming?

921
01:19:38,754 --> 01:19:41,314
He always screamed.

922
01:19:44,293 --> 01:19:47,194
He'd bash his cup on the table
for hours

923
01:19:47,229 --> 01:19:50,164
until he got what he wanted.

924
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:53,464
You'd dress him,

925
01:19:53,502 --> 01:19:59,065
and he'd instantly
undress himself.

926
01:19:59,108 --> 01:20:02,874
You'd give him medicine.
He'd spit it out.

927
01:20:04,913 --> 01:20:06,904
What about your husband?

928
01:20:06,949 --> 01:20:09,577
Did he scream too?

929
01:20:09,618 --> 01:20:11,745
What do you want from me?

930
01:20:11,787 --> 01:20:13,379
Yes,
they both screamed.

931
01:20:13,422 --> 01:20:17,586
But it was normal.
He was always like that.

932
01:20:17,626 --> 01:20:19,184
My husband
went into the bathroom,

933
01:20:19,228 --> 01:20:21,924
and Angelo kept on screaming.

934
01:20:25,801 --> 01:20:27,792
So what did you do?

935
01:20:29,638 --> 01:20:32,300
I put my head under the cushion.

936
01:20:35,577 --> 01:20:38,740
You'd have done the same.

937
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:40,975
Anyone would have.

938
01:20:44,153 --> 01:20:46,348
Then I fell asleep.

939
01:20:46,388 --> 01:20:49,755
Could you still hear
from under the cushion?

940
01:20:53,996 --> 01:20:57,432
What was your husband
screaming?

941
01:20:57,466 --> 01:21:00,799
I don't want you to get
the wrong idea.

942
01:21:00,836 --> 01:21:03,430
Tell me what he was screaming.

943
01:21:03,472 --> 01:21:05,736
I won't get the wrong idea.

944
01:21:07,376 --> 01:21:09,571
Never.

945
01:21:09,611 --> 01:21:13,172
I'll never tell a living soul.

946
01:21:49,685 --> 01:21:52,245
When I saw you out here
the other night,

947
01:21:52,287 --> 01:21:54,847
I thought you were coming here.

948
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:56,881
Did you think so?

949
01:22:00,429 --> 01:22:02,260
I think you hoped so.

950
01:22:03,966 --> 01:22:05,866
Yes.

951
01:22:05,901 --> 01:22:07,835
I hoped so.

952
01:22:07,869 --> 01:22:10,861
Everyone hopes so.

953
01:22:12,574 --> 01:22:20,345
It gets to a point where they can't hold it
in any longer.

954
01:22:23,518 --> 01:22:26,112
And they need to talk, right?

955
01:22:30,025 --> 01:22:33,358
I knew the other night.

956
01:22:33,395 --> 01:22:36,057
But I needed more information.

957
01:22:36,098 --> 01:22:39,534
I couldn't answer
the simplest question.

958
01:22:39,568 --> 01:22:41,001
"Why?"

959
01:22:43,105 --> 01:22:46,006
Anna and I
were seeing each other.

960
01:22:46,041 --> 01:22:48,635
It had been going on
a few months.

961
01:22:48,677 --> 01:22:51,840
Then she started making
ridiculous requests.

962
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:55,748
She wanted to live here.
She wanted me to tell Chiara.

963
01:22:55,784 --> 01:22:57,945
She had become obsessive.

964
01:23:00,656 --> 01:23:03,284
So you killed her.

965
01:23:03,325 --> 01:23:05,418
Yes.

966
01:23:08,997 --> 01:23:10,794
Yes.

967
01:23:14,369 --> 01:23:17,167
My throat's a bit dry.

968
01:23:43,932 --> 01:23:46,833
Want me to take you inside?

969
01:23:46,868 --> 01:23:49,302
No, let's wait.

970
01:24:00,849 --> 01:24:02,009
In different circumstances,

971
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:06,043
I'd have been offended
about such a big lie.

972
01:24:10,359 --> 01:24:13,453
Don't you believe me?

973
01:24:13,495 --> 01:24:17,192
No, I don't.

974
01:24:17,232 --> 01:24:19,462
What else
do you want to know?

975
01:24:22,204 --> 01:24:26,402
I told you.
She tormented me.

976
01:24:26,441 --> 01:24:30,775
That morning, when I met her
at the coffee shop,

977
01:24:30,812 --> 01:24:34,407
she insisted
that we had to talk.

978
01:24:34,449 --> 01:24:37,976
We arranged
to meet at the lake,

979
01:24:38,019 --> 01:24:43,616
but she wouldn't
listen to reason.

980
01:24:43,658 --> 01:24:46,923
She was freaking out,

981
01:24:46,962 --> 01:24:49,396
and I lost my temper.

982
01:24:49,431 --> 01:24:53,197
And you threw her backpack
behind Roberto's house.

983
01:24:53,235 --> 01:24:54,725
Yes.

984
01:25:02,544 --> 01:25:04,068
You weren't having an affair with her.

985
01:25:04,112 --> 01:25:06,171
She was a virgin.

986
01:25:06,214 --> 01:25:10,446
She wouldn't have made
any plans.

987
01:25:10,485 --> 01:25:11,918
She had no future.

988
01:25:11,953 --> 01:25:14,751
She had a few months
left to live.

989
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:16,724
That's why
she didn't put up a fight.

990
01:25:24,566 --> 01:25:28,400
Why are there no photos
of Angelo?

991
01:25:28,437 --> 01:25:29,927
Why do you ask?

992
01:25:32,841 --> 01:25:35,139
Why don't you just arrest me?

993
01:25:35,177 --> 01:25:37,475
Answer me.

994
01:25:40,515 --> 01:25:45,282
What do you know
how it feels to lose a child?

995
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:46,753
What do you know?

996
01:25:46,788 --> 01:25:48,779
I can't imagine it.

997
01:25:52,861 --> 01:25:55,022
You go to the bathroom,

998
01:25:55,063 --> 01:25:58,726
and you find his toothbrush

999
01:25:58,767 --> 01:26:03,864
or his rubber duck
on the bathtub.

1000
01:26:03,905 --> 01:26:06,271
Months go by.

1001
01:26:06,308 --> 01:26:08,868
Then you find more toys
under the sofa.

1002
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:10,878
So you put everything away.

1003
01:26:10,912 --> 01:26:14,404
But every time, you feel like
you're committing a crime.

1004
01:26:23,358 --> 01:26:24,882
You know how long

1005
01:26:24,926 --> 01:26:27,451
a child's smell
lingers on their pajamas?

1006
01:26:27,496 --> 01:26:30,795
Who called the ambulance
the day Angelo died?

1007
01:26:35,437 --> 01:26:40,170
The operator says
it was a girl's voice,

1008
01:26:40,208 --> 01:26:43,336
in such a state
that she didn't leave her name.

1009
01:26:47,415 --> 01:26:51,078
A girl who came past here
every day,

1010
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:54,577
right past your window.

1011
01:26:54,623 --> 01:26:57,217
Anna told him what she'd seen,

1012
01:26:57,259 --> 01:26:58,954
that Angelo
had stopped breathing

1013
01:26:58,994 --> 01:27:03,988
and no one
was trying to help him, no one.

1014
01:27:07,836 --> 01:27:09,895
And she also saw you.

1015
01:27:12,741 --> 01:27:17,201
You heard Angelo coughing, but...

1016
01:27:22,017 --> 01:27:24,815
You did nothing.

1017
01:27:26,755 --> 01:27:28,746
That's enough.

1018
01:27:30,859 --> 01:27:31,951
That's enough.

1019
01:27:31,993 --> 01:27:35,258
From the day Anna found out
she was ill,

1020
01:27:35,297 --> 01:27:38,323
she'd become obsessive.

1021
01:27:38,366 --> 01:27:40,630
Her glances, her calls...

1022
01:27:40,669 --> 01:27:43,968
accused you
and wouldn't let you forget.

1023
01:27:50,512 --> 01:27:54,676
I've just confessed a murder.

1024
01:27:54,716 --> 01:27:58,482
I killed Anna.

1025
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:00,511
That's enough.

1026
01:28:02,824 --> 01:28:04,815
All right.

1027
01:28:37,425 --> 01:28:41,521
My husband said he doesn't want
to be there during the birth.

1028
01:28:43,331 --> 01:28:45,663
I was disappointed.

1029
01:28:49,371 --> 01:28:52,829
Were you at
your daughter's birth?

1030
01:28:52,874 --> 01:28:54,501
I opted out too.

1031
01:28:54,542 --> 01:28:57,909
See what you men are like?

1032
01:28:57,946 --> 01:28:59,937
And your wife?

1033
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:04,280
She was disappointed too.

1034
01:29:08,456 --> 01:29:11,755
Now, after all this time,
do you regret it?

1035
01:29:14,262 --> 01:29:16,787
Yes.

1036
01:29:16,831 --> 01:29:21,461
If I invite you to dinner,
will you tell my husband?

1037
01:29:21,503 --> 01:29:23,368
What?

1038
01:29:23,405 --> 01:29:27,808
That you regret it now.

1039
01:29:27,842 --> 01:29:29,901
Of course.

1040
01:29:29,944 --> 01:29:31,935
Are you being serious?

1041
01:29:35,016 --> 01:29:37,348
Of course.

1042
01:29:50,632 --> 01:29:53,260
I came to say
we made a mistake.

1043
01:29:56,471 --> 01:29:58,405
Your mom's outside
waiting for you.

1044
01:30:03,311 --> 01:30:06,542
We never know what to say
to people we've wrongly accused.

1045
01:30:06,581 --> 01:30:08,481
I'm sorry.

1046
01:30:13,088 --> 01:30:16,216
You've been very strong.

1047
01:30:16,257 --> 01:30:19,988
Maybe you should have
a good cry now.

1048
01:30:20,028 --> 01:30:21,359
But not on your shoulder.

1049
01:30:21,396 --> 01:30:24,058
Right.

1050
01:30:44,853 --> 01:30:47,014
Does she really love him?

1051
01:30:49,124 --> 01:30:52,389
That's what the doctors say.

1052
01:30:56,998 --> 01:31:00,832
What about him?

1053
01:31:00,869 --> 01:31:02,860
He adores her.

1054
01:31:39,674 --> 01:31:43,838
Did you see that?

1055
01:31:43,878 --> 01:31:46,210
She smiled at you.

1056
01:31:47,305 --> 01:32:47,243
