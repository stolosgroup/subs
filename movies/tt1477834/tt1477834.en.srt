<i>Jules Verne
once wrote,</i>

4
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:10,426
<i>"Put two ships
in the open sea</i>

5
00:01:10,428 --> 00:01:13,765
<i>"without wind or tide,
they will come together."</i>

6
00:01:35,854 --> 00:01:40,525
<i>That's how my parents met.
Like two ships destined for each other.</i>

7
00:01:45,196 --> 00:01:47,130
<i>We are something else.
Try Arthur Treacher...</i>

8
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,604
It's okay.

9
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:07,649
Easy. You weren't breathing.

10
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,598
<i>They were
from different worlds.</i>

11
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:27,069
<i>But life,
like the sea,</i>

12
00:02:27,071 --> 00:02:29,540
<i>has a way
of bringing people together.</i>

13
00:03:12,616 --> 00:03:13,884
Uh...

14
00:03:15,186 --> 00:03:16,920
I was gonna
make you some eggs.

15
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,689
Just don't eat my dog, okay?

16
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:25,627
It's okay.

17
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:27,165
I made tea.

18
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:33,635
Go on, try it.

19
00:03:33,637 --> 00:03:34,905
It'll make you better.

20
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:57,961
So, uh, who are you?

21
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,734
Atlanna.

22
00:04:05,502 --> 00:04:07,237
Queen of Atlantis.

23
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:10,872
Wow.

24
00:04:10,874 --> 00:04:15,845
I'm Tom. Keeper of lighthouse.

25
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:49,043
<i>She had fled
an arranged marriage.</i>

26
00:04:49,045 --> 00:04:51,078
<i>Left her whole world behind.</i>

27
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,280
<i>But in my father's lighthouse,</i>

28
00:04:53,282 --> 00:04:55,751
<i>she found something
unexpected.</i>

29
00:04:58,387 --> 00:05:02,359
<i>And my father
found the love of his life.</i>

30
00:05:06,997 --> 00:05:08,563
<i>Category 4 Hurricane Arthur</i>

31
00:05:08,565 --> 00:05:11,466
<i>is due to make landfall
sometime after 2:00 p.m.</i>

32
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:13,803
How about Arthur?

33
00:05:14,404 --> 00:05:15,871
After the hurricane?

34
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:20,575
After a legend.
He's a king, isn't he?

35
00:05:20,577 --> 00:05:23,378
He's more than that.

36
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,048
He's living proof
our people can coexist.

37
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,919
He could unite
our worlds one day.

38
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,096
And the trident could only
be wielded by the strongest Atlantean.

39
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:47,435
And it gave King Atlan mastery
over the seven seas.

40
00:05:47,437 --> 00:05:51,640
It made him so powerful that
the ocean itself became jealous

41
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:56,110
and sent a terrible earthquake
to destroy Atlantis.

42
00:05:56,112 --> 00:05:58,512
Down it fell,
to the bottom of the ocean.

43
00:05:58,514 --> 00:06:03,117
But, legend has it that one
day a new king will come

44
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:05,452
who will use
the power of the trident

45
00:06:05,454 --> 00:06:08,688
to put Atlantis back together again.

46
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,765
Take him!

47
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,417
<i>Queen Atlanna,</i>

48
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,552
<i>by the authority
of King Orvax,</i>

49
00:06:38,554 --> 00:06:41,655
<i>you are ordered
to return to Atlantis.</i>

50
00:06:41,657 --> 00:06:42,924
Atlanna!

51
00:06:45,528 --> 00:06:47,996
<i>But Atlantis'
memory is long...</i>

52
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:52,633
<i>And its king refused
to let her go.</i>

53
00:07:05,214 --> 00:07:07,481
- Atlanna!
- Tom!

54
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:09,385
- My weapon!
- Here!

55
00:07:35,844 --> 00:07:38,778
<i>Their two worlds
were never meant to meet,</i>

56
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,181
<i>and I was a product of a love
that never should've been.</i>

57
00:07:42,183 --> 00:07:44,150
You don't have to do this,
Atlanna. Please.

58
00:07:44,152 --> 00:07:48,289
No. They will always find me.

59
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,058
Next time,
they'll send an army.

60
00:07:52,127 --> 00:07:56,565
I have to go back.
It is the only way to save him.

61
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:01,570
Save you.

62
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:08,176
Where I come from...

63
00:08:09,811 --> 00:08:12,814
The sea carries
our tears away.

64
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,351
Not here.

65
00:08:17,686 --> 00:08:19,354
Here you feel them.

66
00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:31,566
I will return to you.
When it's safe.

67
00:08:32,434 --> 00:08:33,566
One day.

68
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:36,504
Right here, at sunrise.

69
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:41,008
We'll be together again.

70
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:45,745
You stay strong,
my little prince.

71
00:08:45,747 --> 00:08:47,948
I'll always be with you.

72
00:08:56,223 --> 00:08:59,427
Don't let him forget me. Hmm?

73
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:26,853
All life came from the sea,

74
00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:29,122
so if we want
to understand ourselves,

75
00:09:29,124 --> 00:09:31,090
we must journey
to where we began.

76
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:35,961
Now, today, we have better maps of
Mars than we do of our own sea floor.

77
00:09:35,963 --> 00:09:38,097
Come on, closer.
Come on, fishy.

78
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:40,566
- Come on. Come over here.
- Boys!

79
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:42,835
Stop that. Come on.

80
00:09:42,837 --> 00:09:45,003
Come along.

81
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:48,940
Bye, fishy. Bye.

82
00:09:48,942 --> 00:09:52,077
My name's Arthur.
What's yours?

83
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:55,280
- You guys hungry? Me, too.
- Check it out.

84
00:09:55,282 --> 00:09:57,817
Arthur is talking to the fish.

85
00:09:57,819 --> 00:09:59,519
Such a freak, Arthur.

86
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:02,154
- Stop!
- What are you gonna do about it, freak?

87
00:10:02,156 --> 00:10:04,322
Stop it! Don't!

88
00:10:04,324 --> 00:10:05,527
Let me go!

89
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:04,308
Who are you?

90
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,011
Come on, let's go.
Move it.

91
00:12:06,013 --> 00:12:08,180
Come on. Hurry up.

92
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,990
Sir, we've secured
the captain.

93
00:12:18,992 --> 00:12:20,859
Distress signal's disabled.

94
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:22,493
We're running dark again.

95
00:12:22,495 --> 00:12:24,896
But they heard it.
You can count on it.

96
00:12:24,898 --> 00:12:29,533
I'll make you a deal.
I won't tell you how to captain...

97
00:12:29,535 --> 00:12:31,737
And you don't tell me
how to pirate.

98
00:12:42,815 --> 00:12:44,481
Where's the rest of the crew?

99
00:12:44,483 --> 00:12:46,317
Decided discretion
was the better part of valor

100
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:48,419
and sealed themselves up
in the torpedo bay.

101
00:12:48,421 --> 00:12:50,120
Our reputation precedes us.

102
00:12:50,122 --> 00:12:51,789
Your reputation.

103
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,225
This is your win.

104
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,433
Here.

105
00:13:00,934 --> 00:13:03,200
Can't take that piece of junk.

106
00:13:03,202 --> 00:13:04,638
It's the love of your life.

107
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:08,475
I never told you
the story behind it.

108
00:13:09,408 --> 00:13:11,910
This was your grandfather's.

109
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:15,680
He was one of the Navy's first
frogmen during World War II.

110
00:13:15,682 --> 00:13:21,418
He was so stealthy in the water,
his unit nicknamed him Manta.

111
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,188
But after the war,
his country forgot about him.

112
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,762
So, he went back to the sea,
scavenging and surviving with his wit...

113
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:31,328
And this knife.

114
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,367
He gave it to me
when I was your age.

115
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:38,871
And now it's yours, son.

116
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,635
Did we just hit something?

117
00:14:11,137 --> 00:14:14,303
No. Something hit us.

118
00:14:14,305 --> 00:14:15,806
Sir, there's something
out there.

119
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:17,007
Another submarine?

120
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:18,642
Uh... No. I think it's a man.

121
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:08,594
That's not a man.

122
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:16,667
<i>Alpha, to the right.
Bravo team, sweep the passageway.</i>

123
00:15:38,224 --> 00:15:39,624
Permission to come aboard?

124
00:17:10,148 --> 00:17:11,416
Aquaman!

125
00:17:39,844 --> 00:17:42,881
I've waited
a long time for this.

126
00:17:56,526 --> 00:17:58,129
Am I supposed to know
who you are?

127
00:17:59,364 --> 00:18:01,531
I scavenge the high seas.

128
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:03,765
You're the Aquaman.

129
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:06,034
We were bound
to meet at some point.

130
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,475
Let's not make it a habit.

131
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,076
Up.

132
00:19:07,365 --> 00:19:08,565
Ow.

133
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:23,213
Dad!

134
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:27,048
Dad? Ow.

135
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:30,721
That's your kid?

136
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:37,158
Shame on you.

137
00:19:39,062 --> 00:19:40,829
Boys got yourselves
into this mess.

138
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:42,097
Get yourselves out of it.

139
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:43,100
Bastard!

140
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,910
Dad!

141
00:20:02,252 --> 00:20:03,286
Dad!

142
00:20:06,323 --> 00:20:07,688
Wait!

143
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,523
Help me! He's trapped!

144
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:11,294
You can't leave him like this!

145
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,528
Please!

146
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,601
You killed innocent people.
You ask the sea for mercy.

147
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:33,515
Get outta here! I got this!

148
00:20:33,517 --> 00:20:35,182
Shut up, I'm not leaving you!

149
00:20:35,184 --> 00:20:39,153
You need to live,
so you can kill that son of a bitch!

150
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:44,758
- Now, go!
- No!

151
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,328
- Go!
- Shut up!

152
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,168
No!

153
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:53,835
No!

154
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,290
Damn you!

155
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:14,857
Go.

156
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,869
I always know
where to find you.

157
00:22:35,703 --> 00:22:37,071
Old habits.

158
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,748
- Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.
- All right!

159
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:55,056
You want me to have them put
that in a sippy cup for you?

160
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,893
How is it that I can
breathe underwater,

161
00:22:59,895 --> 00:23:02,296
but you can still drink me
under the table?

162
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:05,132
That's my superpower.

163
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,732
<i>A Russian submarine</i>

164
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:08,968
<i>hijacked late last night
by high-tech pirates.</i>

165
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,104
<i>The same pirates
who are suspected</i>

166
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:13,973
<i>in connection with the disappearance
of the Navy's highly classified</i>

167
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,476
<i>prototype stealth submarine.</i>

168
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,812
<i>And a further development,
we now have unconfirmed reports</i>

169
00:23:19,814 --> 00:23:23,550
<i>that the metahuman dubbed by
social media as "The Aquaman"</i>

170
00:23:23,552 --> 00:23:25,421
<i>was responsible
for this daring rescue.</i>

171
00:23:26,522 --> 00:23:27,853
That's not me.

172
00:23:27,855 --> 00:23:32,024
Bullshit. You're doing it,
aren't you? Huh?

173
00:23:32,026 --> 00:23:34,293
What Vulko trained you to do.

174
00:23:34,295 --> 00:23:38,532
I knew you couldn't stand
on the sidelines forever.

175
00:23:38,534 --> 00:23:40,634
Your mother
always knew you were special.

176
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:42,201
Don't even start.

177
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:45,271
She believed you'd be the one
to unite our two worlds.

178
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:46,441
Just stop.

179
00:23:49,644 --> 00:23:53,613
Whatever Atlantis' problems
are, you're bigger than them.

180
00:23:53,615 --> 00:23:55,648
Atlantis murdered my mother.

181
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,149
You don't know that for sure.

182
00:23:57,151 --> 00:23:58,517
Yes, I do.

183
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:02,323
They killed her.
For loving you and having me.

184
00:24:02,924 --> 00:24:04,525
And you know it.

185
00:24:08,762 --> 00:24:12,764
Son, one day you're gonna
have to stop blaming yourself.

186
00:24:18,972 --> 00:24:20,208
Hey, buddy.

187
00:24:21,643 --> 00:24:24,044
You that fish boy from the TV?

188
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,414
Oh, great.

189
00:24:32,687 --> 00:24:36,087
It's "fish man."
What do you want?

190
00:24:36,089 --> 00:24:38,091
I'll tell you what I want.

191
00:24:41,763 --> 00:24:43,461
Could we get
a picture with you?

192
00:24:43,463 --> 00:24:46,398
You're like
our local hero, man.

193
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,037
It would mean a lot.
Just a quick...

194
00:24:54,608 --> 00:24:55,940
Whatever.

195
00:24:55,942 --> 00:24:57,542
- All right. Let's do this.
- Don't touch me.

196
00:24:57,544 --> 00:24:59,845
Right, that's exactly right.
I'm gonna go down here.

197
00:24:59,847 --> 00:25:02,448
There we go. Everybody smile.

198
00:25:55,803 --> 00:25:58,838
He understands the
significance of this meeting.

199
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,806
He'll hear you out.

200
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:22,160
- King Orm.
- King Nereus.

201
00:26:22,162 --> 00:26:25,597
You picked a meeting place too
close to the surface for my liking.

202
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:28,433
You don't recognize
the Council of the Kings?

203
00:26:28,435 --> 00:26:31,836
In Atlan's time,
when the Seven Kingdoms were one,

204
00:26:31,838 --> 00:26:34,539
our ancestors gathered here.

205
00:26:34,541 --> 00:26:37,243
Atlantis sat here
at the head of the table.

206
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:40,944
Xebel, as always, by his side.

207
00:26:40,946 --> 00:26:42,814
Brine. Fishermen.

208
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:45,048
The Deserters and the Trench
had not yet fallen.

209
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,151
The Lost Nation
had not yet vanished.

210
00:26:47,153 --> 00:26:51,121
Together, they were the greatest
empire the world had ever seen.

211
00:26:51,123 --> 00:26:53,123
But now,
I sit on Atlan's throne,

212
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:55,827
shackled by archaic laws
and politics.

213
00:26:55,829 --> 00:26:57,995
While the threat above us
grows undeniably...

214
00:26:57,997 --> 00:27:00,300
Violence has always
plagued the surface.

215
00:27:01,101 --> 00:27:02,534
They will destroy themselves.

216
00:27:02,536 --> 00:27:05,370
Not before
destroying us first.

217
00:27:05,372 --> 00:27:08,640
We have been hiding
long enough.

218
00:27:08,642 --> 00:27:12,444
The time has come
for Atlantis to rise again.

219
00:27:12,446 --> 00:27:14,614
We honor you,
King Nereus,

220
00:27:16,016 --> 00:27:19,417
by inviting Xebel
to be the first kingdom

221
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:21,719
to join King Orm's alliance.

222
00:27:21,721 --> 00:27:23,555
As if you had a choice, Vulko.

223
00:27:23,557 --> 00:27:25,723
By law, you need
four of the Seven Kingdoms

224
00:27:25,725 --> 00:27:27,392
to ascend and attack.

225
00:27:27,394 --> 00:27:29,594
The Lost Nation and the
Deserters have long perished.

226
00:27:29,596 --> 00:27:31,663
The Trench are nothing
but animals.

227
00:27:31,665 --> 00:27:34,299
The Brine will never join you,
and the Fishermen are cowards.

228
00:27:34,301 --> 00:27:39,437
Without me and my army to convince
them, your plans are stillborn.

229
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:41,806
But I know
what you really want.

230
00:27:41,808 --> 00:27:44,676
Once you've obtained the
pledge of the four kingdoms,

231
00:27:44,678 --> 00:27:46,345
you will be ordained

232
00:27:47,481 --> 00:27:48,748
Ocean Master.

233
00:27:50,216 --> 00:27:52,216
That is merely a title.

234
00:27:52,218 --> 00:27:54,218
I'm no fool, King Orm.

235
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,687
As Ocean Master,
you'll be commander

236
00:27:55,689 --> 00:27:58,489
of the greatest military might
on this planet.

237
00:27:58,491 --> 00:28:00,493
I am the natural choice
to lead it.

238
00:28:02,628 --> 00:28:04,729
Are you?

239
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:07,364
What about the rumors
that there's another?

240
00:28:07,366 --> 00:28:10,969
An Atlantean,
living among the surface.

241
00:28:10,971 --> 00:28:13,437
One of royal blood.

242
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:17,341
You may sit on the throne of Atlantis,
but your claim to it is weak.

243
00:28:17,343 --> 00:28:19,476
How can you possibly hope
to unite the empire?

244
00:28:19,478 --> 00:28:22,813
My mother's bastard has
never even been to Atlantis.

245
00:28:22,815 --> 00:28:24,047
His loyalty is to the surface.

246
00:28:34,827 --> 00:28:37,263
Surface-dwellers! To arms!

247
00:28:58,049 --> 00:28:59,316
Your king is injured!

248
00:29:58,944 --> 00:30:01,145
I'm not trying to start a war.

249
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,613
The war has already begun.

250
00:30:03,615 --> 00:30:07,218
Then it's time we send them
a message they'll hear.

251
00:30:11,556 --> 00:30:12,923
- I'm good.
- Stop.

252
00:30:12,925 --> 00:30:14,724
- Here're the keys.
- Thank you.

253
00:30:14,726 --> 00:30:17,126
Let's go home
and work on your <i>ta moko.</i> Huh?

254
00:30:17,128 --> 00:30:18,628
If your grandpops
was still alive,

255
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,698
he'd be banging our heads
for not finishing it.

256
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:25,468
Yes, he would, but there is
plenty of time for that.

257
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,172
We gotta get you to bed.

258
00:30:30,575 --> 00:30:31,674
Got it?

259
00:30:38,383 --> 00:30:39,949
I've been looking for you.

260
00:30:39,951 --> 00:30:41,283
Oh, no, no, no...

261
00:30:41,285 --> 00:30:42,652
I need you to come with me
to Atlantis.

262
00:30:42,654 --> 00:30:44,487
Listen, I'm gonna
tell you the same thing

263
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:46,489
that I told that
rusty starfish Vulko.

264
00:30:46,491 --> 00:30:48,524
Except nicer,
because you're a lady.

265
00:30:48,526 --> 00:30:50,526
No, thank you.
I'm not interested.

266
00:30:50,528 --> 00:30:53,696
You defeated Steppenwolf
and saved Atlantis.

267
00:30:53,698 --> 00:30:55,865
That had nothing to do
with Atlantis.

268
00:30:55,867 --> 00:30:59,201
Your half-brother King Orm is about
to declare war upon the surface world.

269
00:30:59,203 --> 00:31:01,138
Billions will die.

270
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,574
Your people and mine.

271
00:31:03,374 --> 00:31:05,276
We must stop him.

272
00:31:09,815 --> 00:31:11,715
And how do you propose
we do that?

273
00:31:11,717 --> 00:31:15,184
You are the firstborn son
of Queen Atlanna.

274
00:31:15,186 --> 00:31:17,486
The throne is yours
by birthright.

275
00:31:17,488 --> 00:31:22,993
The only way to stop this war
and save both worlds

276
00:31:22,995 --> 00:31:26,562
is for you to take
your rightful place as king.

277
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:32,401
You think if I just show up,
Orm's gonna give up the throne?

278
00:31:32,403 --> 00:31:35,971
I'm the bastard son of the
queen your people executed.

279
00:31:35,973 --> 00:31:38,607
Trust me. I am no king.

280
00:31:38,609 --> 00:31:39,475
I agree.

281
00:31:39,477 --> 00:31:41,877
That's awesome. Cool.

282
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:44,847
But, Vulko seems to believe
in you for some reason,

283
00:31:44,849 --> 00:31:46,482
and that's why I'm here.

284
00:31:46,484 --> 00:31:49,385
Vulko has learned of the location
of the Lost Trident of Atlan.

285
00:31:49,387 --> 00:31:51,454
Ooh, fairy tales. It's a myth.

286
00:31:51,456 --> 00:31:52,988
It's not a myth.

287
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,091
With the Sacred Trident,
the people will listen to you.

288
00:31:55,093 --> 00:31:58,393
You can then claim your
birthright and dethrone Orm.

289
00:31:58,395 --> 00:32:02,263
My birthright?
It died with my mother.

290
00:32:02,265 --> 00:32:04,667
But I promise you this.
If Orm attacks,

291
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:07,839
I will treat him exactly the
same way your people treated her.

292
00:32:09,173 --> 00:32:10,607
With no mercy.

293
00:33:08,065 --> 00:33:12,668
<i>That submarine was barely operational,
but it served its purpose.</i>

294
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:16,437
One of your kind intervened.

295
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:18,506
<i>He is not one of us.</i>

296
00:33:18,508 --> 00:33:21,411
He killed my father.

297
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,648
<i>Our transaction has ended.</i>

298
00:33:28,318 --> 00:33:31,755
Keep the money.
I want Aquaman.

299
00:34:42,725 --> 00:34:43,926
Dad!

300
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,399
Dad!

301
00:35:17,861 --> 00:35:18,862
Dad!

302
00:35:23,432 --> 00:35:24,667
Pops!

303
00:35:26,202 --> 00:35:27,668
Pops!

304
00:35:30,407 --> 00:35:32,741
Come on, Pops.

305
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:36,277
Come on! He's not breathing.

306
00:35:36,279 --> 00:35:37,579
Move! Let me help.

307
00:35:45,121 --> 00:35:46,488
Come on, Pops.

308
00:35:58,033 --> 00:35:59,034
Come on.

309
00:36:13,514 --> 00:36:15,816
I don't even know your name.

310
00:36:15,818 --> 00:36:18,586
It's Princess Y'Mera
Xebella Challa.

311
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:21,589
You may call me Mera.

312
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,893
Thank you, Mera.

313
00:36:46,047 --> 00:36:47,515
Dear God.

314
00:36:48,217 --> 00:36:49,851
This was Orm's doing.

315
00:36:51,652 --> 00:36:53,554
The worst is yet to come.

316
00:37:01,163 --> 00:37:02,996
<i>There's a
flash flood warning here</i>

317
00:37:02,998 --> 00:37:05,699
<i>that was just extended
for a couple hours.</i>

318
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:08,301
<i>Unprecedented sights
from all over the world today.</i>

319
00:37:08,303 --> 00:37:11,972
<i>We are seeing warships and trash
washed up by massive waves.</i>

320
00:37:11,974 --> 00:37:15,308
<i>These extraordinary scenes
of coastlines deluged with waste</i>

321
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,811
<i>and garbage are taking place
all over the world.</i>

322
00:37:17,813 --> 00:37:21,081
<i>Decades of pollution
has been thrown back onto land.</i>

323
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:22,916
<i>Many are asking the question,</i>

324
00:37:22,918 --> 00:37:24,284
<i>"Was this a natural disaster
or something else?"</i>

325
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:26,887
<i>No. This was
no natural disaster.</i>

326
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:29,222
<i>They threw out our garbage
and our warships.</i>

327
00:37:29,224 --> 00:37:31,624
<i>This was our first contact
with the people of Atlantis.</i>

328
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:34,928
<i>There you go again with your
insane Atlantean theory.</i>

329
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:36,829
<i>You have absolutely
no proof, Dr. Shin.</i>

330
00:37:36,831 --> 00:37:38,265
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

331
00:37:38,267 --> 00:37:39,832
<i>We already have
an Atlantean living among us,</i>

332
00:37:39,834 --> 00:37:41,569
<i>and his name is Aquaman.</i>

333
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:50,876
What is it?

334
00:37:50,878 --> 00:37:55,081
This is the exact spot that Vulko
gave me my first swimming lesson.

335
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:58,418
You have to forget all
the teaching of the surface world

336
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:03,189
and go deeper to uncover
your Atlantean instincts.

337
00:38:03,191 --> 00:38:05,459
But I already know
how to swim.

338
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:07,195
Not even close.

339
00:38:10,466 --> 00:38:12,698
Just so we're clear,

340
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,735
I'll help you stop this war.

341
00:38:15,336 --> 00:38:16,971
But then, I'm done.

342
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,774
Maybe that's for the best.

343
00:38:40,094 --> 00:38:42,394
The ocean is more than
our life source, Arthur.

344
00:38:42,396 --> 00:38:43,795
It is who we are.

345
00:38:43,797 --> 00:38:45,897
Wait, you can talk underwater?

346
00:38:45,899 --> 00:38:49,401
I can talk underwater, too!

347
00:38:49,403 --> 00:38:51,669
This is awesome!

348
00:38:51,671 --> 00:38:54,641
Oh, we can do more
than just talk.

349
00:39:00,648 --> 00:39:05,784
Being Atlantean means more than
just being able to breathe water.

350
00:39:05,786 --> 00:39:10,789
Your body is equipped to survive
the extreme cold and pressure,

351
00:39:10,791 --> 00:39:13,327
and your eyes adjust
to see in the dark.

352
00:39:37,285 --> 00:39:38,683
This is awesome!

353
00:40:06,314 --> 00:40:09,883
So, Vulko,
when can I meet my mother?

354
00:40:12,018 --> 00:40:14,352
Soon, my young prince.

355
00:40:14,354 --> 00:40:18,758
When you're ready, I'll take you
to Atlantis to meet the queen.

356
00:40:29,035 --> 00:40:30,904
I hid my ship in here.

357
00:40:32,572 --> 00:40:34,405
Listen,
I'm not getting in that thing.

358
00:40:34,407 --> 00:40:36,341
Well, to get where we're
going, you're gonna have to.

359
00:40:36,343 --> 00:40:38,509
Your fish ship has been
marinating in chum butter.

360
00:40:38,511 --> 00:40:40,511
I'm gonna come out
smelling like swamp butt.

361
00:40:40,513 --> 00:40:42,249
That'd be an improvement.

362
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,822
Yup. Okay.

363
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:52,684
What's the point in
having a bridge underwater?

364
00:41:52,686 --> 00:41:55,086
The Gateway Bridge
is a remnant of the Old World.

365
00:41:55,088 --> 00:41:57,088
It's also the only way
in or out of the Capital.

366
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,623
Why can't they just
go over the walls?

367
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:00,258
Security is impenetrable.

368
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,992
Even if they did
manage to evade the guards,

369
00:42:01,994 --> 00:42:03,929
they'd never get past
the hydro-cannons.

370
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,966
People try to sneak in
all the time.

371
00:42:09,436 --> 00:42:10,903
Yeah, right.

372
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:32,155
What is this?

373
00:42:32,157 --> 00:42:34,591
Customs
and border control.

374
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:37,596
Don't worry.
I have diplomatic clearance.

375
00:42:45,471 --> 00:42:46,472
Welcome home.

376
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,387
There's a safe house
down in the Old City.

377
00:43:37,389 --> 00:43:40,657
The Highborns never venture
to the sea floor.

378
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:41,660
We're here.

379
00:44:10,923 --> 00:44:12,589
What is this?

380
00:44:12,591 --> 00:44:14,925
We use this air pocket as an
extra layer of precaution.

381
00:44:14,927 --> 00:44:17,494
Only the Highborns can
breathe water as well as air.

382
00:44:17,496 --> 00:44:19,331
Plus,
it keeps the animals out.

383
00:44:20,131 --> 00:44:22,200
They get kind of messy.

384
00:44:24,803 --> 00:44:26,703
Vulko. Here I am, old man.

385
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:29,741
After all these years,
you finally get what you wanted.

386
00:44:32,376 --> 00:44:36,212
Arthur, I wish it was
under better circumstances.

387
00:44:36,214 --> 00:44:38,547
I can't believe Orm attacked.

388
00:44:38,549 --> 00:44:39,482
It wasn't an attack.

389
00:44:39,484 --> 00:44:41,818
Legally,
he's not allowed to yet.

390
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,254
What he did to your surface
warships was merely a warning.

391
00:44:45,256 --> 00:44:46,790
What provoked it?

392
00:44:46,792 --> 00:44:50,426
King Orm and your father
were ambushed by the surface.

393
00:44:50,428 --> 00:44:53,062
By the surface?
I don't think so.

394
00:44:53,064 --> 00:44:54,997
They still think
Atlantis is a fairy tale.

395
00:44:54,999 --> 00:44:56,699
I was there.

396
00:44:56,701 --> 00:44:58,568
A surface warship fired at us.

397
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,304
Now, Xebel sides
with Atlantis,

398
00:45:01,306 --> 00:45:06,209
giving Orm a fleet big enough to force
the other two kingdoms to join him.

399
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:10,780
If we're going to prevent this
war, you must dethrone him now.

400
00:45:10,782 --> 00:45:14,049
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't wanna be king.

401
00:45:14,051 --> 00:45:15,819
You don't understand.

402
00:45:15,821 --> 00:45:18,321
Once he is named Ocean Master,
it'll be too late.

403
00:45:18,323 --> 00:45:22,057
The power at his disposal will be
unlike anything you have ever seen.

404
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:24,728
I'm from the surface.
No one is gonna take me seriously.

405
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,295
Okay? I don't even know
where to begin.

406
00:45:26,297 --> 00:45:28,765
By winning the hearts
and minds of the people

407
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:33,505
by proving to them that you're
worthy, and retrieving this.

408
00:45:38,409 --> 00:45:39,477
Hmm.

409
00:45:40,211 --> 00:45:41,813
I already got one of those.

410
00:45:43,047 --> 00:45:45,314
Not like this one, you don't.

411
00:45:45,316 --> 00:45:47,984
This is
the Lost Trident of Atlan.

412
00:45:47,986 --> 00:45:49,218
Oh, I know the story.

413
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,721
It's more than a story.
It's real.

414
00:45:52,723 --> 00:45:57,760
<i>It was forged by the greatest
weapon masters in history.</i>

415
00:45:57,762 --> 00:46:01,532
<i>Crafted from Poseidon's steel
for King Atlan,</i>

416
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:05,534
<i>the first ruler of Atlantis.</i>

417
00:46:05,536 --> 00:46:09,774
<i>Legend says the trident was imbued
with the power to command the sea.</i>

418
00:46:11,142 --> 00:46:12,975
So what happened to it?

419
00:46:12,977 --> 00:46:16,579
To know that is to go back to
the time before the Great Fall,

420
00:46:16,581 --> 00:46:20,816
<i>when King Atlan
ruled over all that was,</i>

421
00:46:20,818 --> 00:46:23,588
<i>when the kingdoms of Atlantis
were one.</i>

422
00:46:26,023 --> 00:46:32,528
<i>It was a time of great prosperity
and technological advancement.</i>

423
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:35,163
<i>We had unlocked
the secret of unlimited energy</i>

424
00:46:35,165 --> 00:46:36,899
<i>at a time when
the rest of the world</i>

425
00:46:36,901 --> 00:46:38,636
<i>still thought the earth
was flat.</i>

426
00:46:41,104 --> 00:46:44,305
<i>But we became too ambitious,</i>

427
00:46:44,307 --> 00:46:46,976
<i>too hungry for power.</i>

428
00:47:03,194 --> 00:47:06,697
<i>The ocean swallowed us,
and Atlantis sank.</i>

429
00:47:08,265 --> 00:47:11,200
<i>But the very power that
collapsed our civilization</i>

430
00:47:11,202 --> 00:47:14,503
<i>also paved the way
to our future.</i>

431
00:47:14,505 --> 00:47:17,708
<i>It gave us the ability
to breathe underwater.</i>

432
00:47:18,409 --> 00:47:21,410
<i>And so, we evolved.</i>

433
00:47:21,412 --> 00:47:24,580
<i>Others regressed,
became savage.</i>

434
00:47:26,384 --> 00:47:31,720
And the king lived out the remainder
of his days in self-imposed exile.

435
00:47:31,722 --> 00:47:36,091
<i>Neither he nor the trident
were ever seen again.</i>

436
00:47:36,093 --> 00:47:40,361
One of our archeological teams
uncovered this a few months ago.

437
00:47:40,363 --> 00:47:44,232
It's an ancient recording dating
back to the First Dynasty.

438
00:47:44,234 --> 00:47:47,970
I believe it contains Atlan's
final message to his people

439
00:47:47,972 --> 00:47:51,040
and the whereabouts
of the Sacred Trident.

440
00:47:51,042 --> 00:47:52,473
So, what does it say?

441
00:47:52,475 --> 00:47:55,243
We don't know.
The technology's too old.

442
00:47:55,245 --> 00:47:59,014
The cylinder bears the markings
of the Deserter Kingdom.

443
00:47:59,016 --> 00:48:01,816
You must take it there
and retrieve the message.

444
00:48:01,818 --> 00:48:05,789
The clue to Atlan's final
resting place is inside of this.

445
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,206
<i>Border Defense.
You are under arrest for illegal entry.</i>

446
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:27,410
No!

447
00:48:29,112 --> 00:48:30,945
You mustn't be seen here!

448
00:49:26,836 --> 00:49:28,805
I don't suppose you want
to talk about this, do you?

449
00:49:33,977 --> 00:49:35,476
Neither do I.

450
00:50:14,883 --> 00:50:19,888
<i>In the name of His Highness, King
Orm, I place you under arrest.</i>

451
00:50:40,442 --> 00:50:42,110
Welcome to Atlantis...

452
00:50:43,312 --> 00:50:44,513
Brother.

453
00:50:48,784 --> 00:50:51,519
I can't believe
you're finally here.

454
00:50:52,921 --> 00:50:55,757
I've heard so many stories
about you.

455
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:04,731
All these years,
I've been ashamed of my mother

456
00:51:04,733 --> 00:51:08,870
for defiling herself
with a surface-dweller.

457
00:51:08,872 --> 00:51:11,939
Ashamed of the fact that I
have a half-breed brother

458
00:51:11,941 --> 00:51:15,876
whose heart I wanted
to run my trident through.

459
00:51:15,878 --> 00:51:20,281
But now that you're finally here before
me, I must admit...

460
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:29,589
I am conflicted.

461
00:51:29,591 --> 00:51:31,892
You want conflict,

462
00:51:31,894 --> 00:51:34,561
why don't you take these chains
off, little brother?

463
00:51:34,563 --> 00:51:36,498
And we'll see
who gets run through.

464
00:51:38,867 --> 00:51:43,870
Yes, I see you've brought
our mother's weapon.

465
00:51:43,872 --> 00:51:47,574
Is that why you've come here
after all this time?

466
00:51:47,576 --> 00:51:49,175
To kill me?

467
00:51:49,177 --> 00:51:51,978
I came here to stop a maniac
from destroying the world.

468
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,914
I see.

469
00:51:53,916 --> 00:51:55,749
And how do you plan
to stop the atrocities

470
00:51:55,751 --> 00:51:59,686
that the surface
continues to commit?

471
00:51:59,688 --> 00:52:04,458
Because for a century,
they have polluted our waters

472
00:52:05,426 --> 00:52:07,794
and poisoned our children.

473
00:52:07,796 --> 00:52:11,364
And now, their skies burn
and our oceans boil.

474
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:17,070
And you've come all this way to
take sides against your own people?

475
00:52:17,072 --> 00:52:19,239
There are no sides
in a war like this.

476
00:52:19,241 --> 00:52:21,974
You have clearly chosen a side and
come here to challenge the throne.

477
00:52:21,976 --> 00:52:24,011
If that's what it takes
to stop your war.

478
00:52:26,081 --> 00:52:28,948
Are you invoking
the Combat of the Kings?

479
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:33,253
Call it whatever you want.
I call it an ass-whooping.

480
00:52:33,255 --> 00:52:35,788
Well then, perhaps
that's how we'll proceed.

481
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,556
- Your Majesty!
- Orm, please.

482
00:52:37,558 --> 00:52:38,958
Don't you see?

483
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,993
If I defeat the firstborn son
of Atlanna

484
00:52:40,995 --> 00:52:43,462
in a formal challenge
in front of everyone,

485
00:52:43,464 --> 00:52:48,567
then all Seven Kingdoms will have to
concede that I am the one true king.

486
00:52:48,569 --> 00:52:52,571
Your Majesty, there is no victory
in defeating the ignorant.

487
00:52:52,573 --> 00:52:54,175
Your brother
is clearly an imbecile.

488
00:52:55,843 --> 00:52:58,111
Your Highness,
he doesn't know our ways.

489
00:52:58,113 --> 00:53:00,248
Then he's about to get
an education.

490
00:53:01,783 --> 00:53:03,750
Are you officially
challenging me?

491
00:53:03,752 --> 00:53:05,952
Hell yes, I challenge you.
And when I win...

492
00:53:05,954 --> 00:53:07,486
If you win,

493
00:53:07,488 --> 00:53:11,193
I will cease all immediate action.
The war is over.

494
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,661
But if I win...

495
00:53:15,397 --> 00:53:16,597
You're over.

496
00:53:17,366 --> 00:53:18,897
Let's do it.

497
00:53:18,899 --> 00:53:20,532
So be it.

498
00:53:20,534 --> 00:53:23,569
Challenge has been made,
and I accept.

499
00:53:23,571 --> 00:53:26,039
Prepare him
for the Ring of Fire.

500
00:53:26,041 --> 00:53:29,244
Wait. The ring of what?

501
00:53:47,361 --> 00:53:51,230
How could you be so foolish
to let Orm bait you into a fight?

502
00:53:51,232 --> 00:53:53,932
It seems to me like I just
solved all of our problems.

503
00:53:53,934 --> 00:53:56,235
I beat him in a battle,
war's over, I get to go home.

504
00:53:56,237 --> 00:53:58,470
You're a formidable fighter
on land,

505
00:53:58,472 --> 00:54:01,006
but here you're out
of your element, literally.

506
00:54:01,008 --> 00:54:03,809
Orm has spent
his entire life underwater,

507
00:54:03,811 --> 00:54:07,513
training to be a warrior,
training to be the best.

508
00:54:07,515 --> 00:54:09,680
You taught me
how to fight, Cobra Kai.

509
00:54:09,682 --> 00:54:11,819
Let's see
if you remember anything.

510
00:54:15,555 --> 00:54:16,922
So, what's with the big fork?

511
00:54:16,924 --> 00:54:19,692
It's a trident.
Now, defend yourself.

512
00:54:53,259 --> 00:54:54,759
What the hell is this?

513
00:54:54,761 --> 00:54:57,064
I'll teach you this move when
you've mastered the trident.

514
00:55:07,241 --> 00:55:08,740
It's not fair.

515
00:55:08,742 --> 00:55:10,809
This thing is so big and awkward.
Why can't I use a sword?

516
00:55:10,811 --> 00:55:14,580
That's your mother's trident.
A traditional weapon of royalty.

517
00:55:14,582 --> 00:55:18,183
You'll never be a king
until you've mastered it.

518
00:55:18,185 --> 00:55:19,852
Why has she never
come to see me, huh?

519
00:55:19,854 --> 00:55:21,987
I told you,
when you're ready...

520
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:26,091
Stop lying to me!
I've done everything you ever asked.

521
00:55:26,093 --> 00:55:28,926
And every time I pass a test,
you make up another one.

522
00:55:28,928 --> 00:55:30,364
When am I gonna
be good enough?

523
00:55:35,269 --> 00:55:37,136
Does she not love me?

524
00:55:37,138 --> 00:55:40,372
Your mother loved you more
than anything in the world.

525
00:55:40,374 --> 00:55:44,208
But she had to return to
Atlantis to keep you safe.

526
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:47,579
Her marriage to King Orvax
was arranged a long time ago,

527
00:55:47,581 --> 00:55:49,280
so she had to marry him...

528
00:55:49,282 --> 00:55:52,750
And bear him a son,
Prince Orm.

529
00:55:52,752 --> 00:55:55,086
When Orvax eventually
found out about you,

530
00:55:55,088 --> 00:55:57,655
he became overwhelmed
with jealousy

531
00:55:57,657 --> 00:56:02,328
and sacrificed her to the
creatures of the Trench.

532
00:56:05,064 --> 00:56:07,667
Are you saying
they executed her?

533
00:56:08,868 --> 00:56:10,170
Because she had me?

534
00:56:24,816 --> 00:56:26,651
I remember...

535
00:56:26,653 --> 00:56:27,954
Everything.

536
00:56:31,457 --> 00:56:34,358
I have something for you.

537
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,462
It belonged to my mother.

538
00:56:38,096 --> 00:56:40,964
Tell me...

539
00:56:40,966 --> 00:56:44,470
Do you think she would have enjoyed
watching her sons murder each other?

540
00:56:46,038 --> 00:56:50,575
I understand your fear
and your reluctance, Mera.

541
00:56:50,577 --> 00:56:53,910
I truly do. I don't want war...

542
00:56:53,912 --> 00:56:55,312
Don't patronize me!

543
00:56:55,314 --> 00:56:56,781
I know you.

544
00:56:56,783 --> 00:56:58,483
What you're doing flies
in the face of everything

545
00:56:58,485 --> 00:57:00,451
that your mother taught us
when we were children.

546
00:57:00,453 --> 00:57:01,553
If she were here...

547
00:57:01,555 --> 00:57:05,523
But she's not here, is she?

548
00:57:05,525 --> 00:57:08,228
1What my mother taught us
was treason.

549
00:57:08,995 --> 00:57:11,796
Don't follow in her wake.

550
00:57:11,798 --> 00:57:14,732
All right! So, this is the
big, old ring of fire, huh?

551
00:57:14,734 --> 00:57:17,870
How's it work?
I just kick your ass right here?

552
00:57:21,474 --> 00:57:22,873
Vulko.

553
00:57:22,875 --> 00:57:26,845
Will you escort my betrothed
to the royal box?

554
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:39,758
Let's go, Lady Mera.

555
00:57:45,632 --> 00:57:49,667
Down here, we have a legend
about the Karathen,

556
00:57:49,669 --> 00:57:54,572
an ancient sea monster so powerful
that even King Atlan himself feared it.

557
00:57:54,574 --> 00:57:58,975
So, he imprisoned it
in the depths of the ocean.

558
00:57:58,977 --> 00:58:03,681
And in that abyss, the creature
bides its time waiting to rise again.

559
00:58:03,683 --> 00:58:07,317
Atlantis has been
lying in wait...

560
00:58:07,319 --> 00:58:09,221
And now,
the beast has awakened.

561
00:58:15,827 --> 00:58:21,166
There was a time when I wanted
to meet you more than anything.

562
00:58:22,267 --> 00:58:24,467
Get to know my little brother.

563
00:58:24,469 --> 00:58:29,074
Let him know that he wasn't alone,
that we were in it together.

564
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:34,446
If only I had known what a
dick you would turn out to be.

565
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:41,318
You were the reason
our mother was executed.

566
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,921
And I've hated you
for it ever since.

567
00:58:46,191 --> 00:58:49,892
But I do not want
to kill you, Arthur.

568
00:58:49,894 --> 00:58:53,130
I'm going to give you
one chance.

569
00:58:53,799 --> 00:58:56,165
Go home.

570
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:59,071
Do not ever
come back to Atlantis.

571
00:59:00,606 --> 00:59:03,541
You are not going to win this.

572
00:59:03,543 --> 00:59:07,344
A war is coming to the surface
whether you like it or not.

573
00:59:07,346 --> 00:59:10,982
And I am bringing the wrath
of the seven seas with me.

574
00:59:12,117 --> 00:59:14,286
You know I can't
let that happen.

575
00:59:15,554 --> 00:59:17,122
I know.

576
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:21,460
What the hell is that?

577
00:59:23,562 --> 00:59:25,063
The Ring of Fire.

578
00:59:34,206 --> 00:59:35,105
Yeah!

579
00:59:37,942 --> 00:59:39,877
Yeah!

580
00:59:46,618 --> 00:59:48,018
Shit.

581
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,755
People of Atlantis, hear me!

582
00:59:51,757 --> 00:59:55,627
My brother has come from the surface
to challenge me for the throne.

583
00:59:57,362 --> 01:00:00,597
Let us settle his claim
in the ancient way.

584
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:05,134
By bloodshed do the gods
make known their will!

585
01:00:14,579 --> 01:00:16,113
Traitor!

586
01:00:16,748 --> 01:00:18,115
Traitor!

587
01:00:23,354 --> 01:00:25,623
You'll never be king!

588
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:41,904
Never thought I'd see the day
when my own father

589
01:00:41,906 --> 01:00:43,739
would bow before
the king of Atlantis.

590
01:00:43,741 --> 01:00:47,776
The surface-dwellers drew first blood.
What would you have us do?

591
01:00:47,778 --> 01:00:49,244
Beg them for mercy?

592
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:51,613
I detest the surface
as much as you do.

593
01:00:51,615 --> 01:00:54,951
But don't you find the timing
of all of this a bit convenient?

594
01:00:58,323 --> 01:01:02,226
But you wouldn't be
that gullible, would you?

595
01:01:04,896 --> 01:01:06,830
You want this war too,
don't you?

596
01:01:06,832 --> 01:01:09,431
It is past time the surface-dwellers
learned their place in the world.

597
01:01:09,433 --> 01:01:12,169
If this is how it must be
done, then so be it.

598
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:20,409
You have our mother's trident.

599
01:01:20,411 --> 01:01:23,614
Powerful, but flawed like her.

600
01:01:24,648 --> 01:01:26,083
I wield my father's.

601
01:01:27,284 --> 01:01:29,084
And it has never known defeat!

602
01:02:17,635 --> 01:02:20,134
I promised Atlanna
I'd protect him.

603
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:30,781
This isn't a competition.
It's an execution.

604
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:31,566
I am the one true king!

605
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:17,245
You waiting for an invitation?
Get in!

606
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:29,357
Mera!

607
01:05:32,327 --> 01:05:34,061
Oh, yeah.
So, what's the plan?

608
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:37,198
The plan was to recover Atlan's
trident, then challenge Orm.

609
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,933
Okay, so we're doing things
a little out of order.

610
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:39,936
Shit happens.

611
01:05:45,507 --> 01:05:47,440
Heads up!
We got a bogey on our six!

612
01:05:47,442 --> 01:05:49,709
- What does that even mean?
- Bad guys behind us.

613
01:05:49,711 --> 01:05:52,479
- Then just say that!
- Bad guys behind us!

614
01:07:00,015 --> 01:07:02,082
Whoa, whoa, wait,
you said we couldn't go over these walls.

615
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:04,083
- I did!
- You said there were hydro-cannons!

616
01:07:04,085 --> 01:07:05,353
I did, now shut up!

617
01:07:09,691 --> 01:07:11,693
Oh, shit!

618
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:36,417
Shit!

619
01:07:37,052 --> 01:07:38,785
Shit.

620
01:07:38,787 --> 01:07:41,790
We're not dead yet!
But I'm hoping he'll think we are.

621
01:07:43,524 --> 01:07:44,759
Oh!

622
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,400
Here, hold this.

623
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:56,735
What are you doing?

624
01:07:56,737 --> 01:07:58,570
- Listen, it worked for Pinocchio.
- Who?

625
01:07:58,572 --> 01:08:01,375
Never mind.
Come here, get in. Come on.

626
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:05,512
Great.
So we're getting eaten.

627
01:08:27,001 --> 01:08:29,234
How are you even
doing this, anyway?

628
01:08:29,236 --> 01:08:31,003
I don't know.

629
01:08:31,005 --> 01:08:33,572
I can hear them sometimes,
and they can hear me.

630
01:08:33,574 --> 01:08:36,440
Right. Because you're
both big, dumb animals.

631
01:08:36,442 --> 01:08:38,977
- Hey, I just saved your life.
- I saved yours first!

632
01:08:43,483 --> 01:08:45,483
She said, "Coast is clear."

633
01:08:45,485 --> 01:08:47,620
So, where to now?

634
01:08:48,856 --> 01:08:52,525
To the ocean of sand
your people call the Sahara.

635
01:08:53,426 --> 01:08:54,995
All right.

636
01:09:18,519 --> 01:09:20,118
I don't usually
take charters,

637
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,654
but I don't usually get paid
in pirate treasure.

638
01:09:22,656 --> 01:09:23,924
Thanks for the ride, buddy.

639
01:09:25,926 --> 01:09:27,893
Oh, man.

640
01:09:27,895 --> 01:09:29,661
Are you okay?

641
01:09:29,663 --> 01:09:31,865
I've never been
so high up before.

642
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,602
Or so far from home.

643
01:09:36,603 --> 01:09:38,471
But at least you have a home.

644
01:09:39,273 --> 01:09:40,806
Not anymore.

645
01:09:40,808 --> 01:09:42,506
I can never go back.

646
01:09:42,508 --> 01:09:45,478
I betrayed everything when I
saved you from the coliseum.

647
01:09:49,383 --> 01:09:52,650
Yeah, but you're engaged to the king.
They have to take you back.

648
01:09:52,652 --> 01:09:55,820
Atlantis is many
wonderful things.

649
01:09:55,822 --> 01:09:57,722
But forgiving, it is not.

650
01:09:57,724 --> 01:09:59,057
Yeah, but you're royalty.

651
01:09:59,059 --> 01:10:01,360
So was your mother.

652
01:10:01,362 --> 01:10:04,229
If I went back now,
I'd be sacrificed to the Trench.

653
01:10:04,231 --> 01:10:06,933
Even my own father
wouldn't take me back.

654
01:10:11,472 --> 01:10:13,405
Look on the bright side,

655
01:10:13,407 --> 01:10:15,673
now you don't have to marry some tool
bag that you're not in love with.

656
01:10:15,675 --> 01:10:18,876
My obligation isn't to love.

657
01:10:18,878 --> 01:10:21,446
It is to my family
and my nation,

658
01:10:21,448 --> 01:10:23,516
and I've turned
my back on both.

659
01:10:25,818 --> 01:10:29,587
Sometimes,
you have to do what's right,

660
01:10:29,589 --> 01:10:32,525
even if your heart aches
against it.

661
01:10:48,341 --> 01:10:50,741
Your Highness.

662
01:10:50,743 --> 01:10:55,849
The tracker places Princess Mera
here, in the Deserter Kingdom.

663
01:10:56,483 --> 01:10:57,918
You said she was dead.

664
01:10:58,519 --> 01:10:59,987
Apparently not.

665
01:11:01,422 --> 01:11:03,188
Then your brother
still lives as well?

666
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:04,523
Not for long.

667
01:11:04,525 --> 01:11:06,525
Captain Murk, assemble
a strike force immediately.

668
01:11:06,527 --> 01:11:11,263
No! Mera is to be arrested
and safely returned to me.

669
01:11:11,265 --> 01:11:12,431
She betrayed the throne.

670
01:11:12,433 --> 01:11:14,832
She is a daughter of Xebel.

671
01:11:14,834 --> 01:11:17,802
If any harm befalls her,
our coalition is over.

672
01:11:17,804 --> 01:11:19,371
Your Highness,

673
01:11:19,373 --> 01:11:22,773
we are now entering the waters
of the Fishermen Kingdom.

674
01:11:22,775 --> 01:11:26,877
Securing the alliance
of the other two kingdoms

675
01:11:26,879 --> 01:11:28,981
should be
our immediate concern.

676
01:11:32,118 --> 01:11:38,089
My vizier is correct.
As usual.

677
01:11:38,091 --> 01:11:44,597
Arrest them and bring back
King Nereus' daughter unharmed.

678
01:12:07,487 --> 01:12:08,988
We're here!

679
01:12:10,389 --> 01:12:11,654
Hey!

680
01:12:11,656 --> 01:12:13,190
Is there anything nearby?

681
01:12:13,192 --> 01:12:15,292
Nothing but desert
for hundreds of K's, mate!

682
01:12:15,294 --> 01:12:17,328
- Nothing but desert.
- He's wrong.

683
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:20,399
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Wait! No! Oh...

684
01:12:23,101 --> 01:12:25,969
She just jumped!
She didn't have a parachute!

685
01:12:25,971 --> 01:12:28,472
Redheads! You gotta love 'em.

686
01:12:43,623 --> 01:12:45,755
Shit!

687
01:12:57,904 --> 01:12:59,702
Oh, you're crazier
than I thought!

688
01:12:59,704 --> 01:13:01,140
A-ha!

689
01:13:02,241 --> 01:13:03,708
This way.

690
01:13:24,796 --> 01:13:28,367
<i>You were defeated the last time because
your surface weapons failed you.</i>

691
01:13:29,335 --> 01:13:30,469
<i>Ours will not.</i>

692
01:13:33,872 --> 01:13:35,406
<i>It's prototype armor</i>

693
01:13:35,408 --> 01:13:38,274
<i>for the next generation
Atlantean soldier.</i>

694
01:13:38,276 --> 01:13:41,010
<i>Revenge is something
we Atlanteans understand.</i>

695
01:13:41,012 --> 01:13:44,380
<i>You will lead my finest
commandos as your personal army</i>

696
01:13:44,382 --> 01:13:46,950
<i>to hunt down
the half-breed abomination.</i>

697
01:13:46,952 --> 01:13:51,454
<i>I cannot touch them, but you can.
He's fled to your world.</i>

698
01:13:51,456 --> 01:13:54,924
<i>Kill him and the woman he's
with, and you will be rewarded.</i>

699
01:13:54,926 --> 01:13:57,229
Killing him is my reward.

700
01:14:00,699 --> 01:14:03,068
<i>The crown jewel.
Still experimental.</i>

701
01:14:04,636 --> 01:14:07,505
<i>Converts water into beams
of energized plasma.</i>

702
01:15:19,678 --> 01:15:21,277
Hmm.

703
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:23,780
I think I'm gonna need
a bigger helmet.

704
01:15:23,782 --> 01:15:26,382
One of the tribes of
Atlantis broke off and settled here

705
01:15:26,384 --> 01:15:28,551
when this region
was still an inland sea.

706
01:15:28,553 --> 01:15:31,387
When the water dried up,
they perished along with it.

707
01:15:31,389 --> 01:15:33,121
Perished?
Yeah, that's terrific.

708
01:15:33,123 --> 01:15:34,357
We're getting close now.

709
01:15:34,359 --> 01:15:36,825
Oh, yeah? Close to what?
Dying of thirst?

710
01:15:36,827 --> 01:15:38,795
Close to getting
punched in the face!

711
01:15:38,797 --> 01:15:40,596
Look, <i>Fight Club,</i> I know you're
new to how things work up here.

712
01:15:40,598 --> 01:15:42,898
Why don't you look around?
We are lost.

713
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,500
You see that over there?
Hey, what is that?

714
01:15:44,502 --> 01:15:47,269
<i>Nada.</i> This place
is a wasteland.

715
01:15:47,271 --> 01:15:49,772
You're the one who calls
this wasteland a home.

716
01:15:49,774 --> 01:15:51,406
This isn't my home!

717
01:15:51,408 --> 01:15:53,241
It's not like the whole
surface looks like this!

718
01:15:53,243 --> 01:15:55,177
Oh, no, of course not.

719
01:15:55,179 --> 01:15:58,413
You've also got disgusting cities
whose sewers empty out into our ocean

720
01:15:58,415 --> 01:16:00,315
and whole mountains
made out of trash.

721
01:16:00,317 --> 01:16:02,017
And, oh, you've got
great factories

722
01:16:02,019 --> 01:16:03,919
that do nothing but belch
out filth and melt ice caps.

723
01:16:03,921 --> 01:16:05,987
Okay. Point taken. Listen.

724
01:16:05,989 --> 01:16:07,456
Yeah, we got
some idiots running the show,

725
01:16:07,458 --> 01:16:09,458
but we've got some
good things too, all right?

726
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:11,727
We got green forests and big
mountains and beautiful lakes.

727
01:16:11,729 --> 01:16:14,563
You'd love 'em.
They're like little baby oceans.

728
01:16:14,565 --> 01:16:16,398
Are you trying to provoke me?

729
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,100
I'm just saying you cannot judge a
place before you've even seen it.

730
01:16:18,102 --> 01:16:20,937
You've judged Atlantis
on far less.

731
01:16:24,341 --> 01:16:27,875
No. Would you just stop it
with that? No.

732
01:16:27,877 --> 01:16:31,480
Your stupid Atlantean GPS just
told you to jump out of an airplane

733
01:16:31,482 --> 01:16:33,448
over the middle of the desert,
and now we are stranded.

734
01:16:36,754 --> 01:16:39,390
If you're the next true
king, we're doomed.

735
01:17:07,718 --> 01:17:09,052
That was awesome.

736
01:17:14,224 --> 01:17:17,060
Oh. Look what I found.

737
01:17:18,061 --> 01:17:19,361
What you found?

738
01:17:19,363 --> 01:17:20,364
Yeah.

739
01:17:30,774 --> 01:17:32,476
Check this place out.

740
01:17:33,075 --> 01:17:34,709
This is badass!

741
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,747
This is
the Hall of Armory.

742
01:17:38,749 --> 01:17:42,084
Where the legends say
Atlan's trident was forged.

743
01:17:43,454 --> 01:17:45,589
I don't think
they're legends anymore.

744
01:17:51,829 --> 01:17:53,262
Vulko was right.

745
01:17:55,799 --> 01:17:57,233
It's real.

746
01:18:34,570 --> 01:18:35,605
Huh.

747
01:18:36,339 --> 01:18:38,305
Nothing.

748
01:18:38,307 --> 01:18:40,307
Of course it's not working.

749
01:18:40,309 --> 01:18:42,678
It's been sitting here collecting dust
since before the Sahara was a desert.

750
01:18:44,881 --> 01:18:46,647
Man!

751
01:18:46,649 --> 01:18:49,683
"Since before
the Sahara was a desert."

752
01:18:49,685 --> 01:18:51,852
Thank you for repeating
what I just said.

753
01:18:51,854 --> 01:18:53,723
It's completely dried out.

754
01:18:55,659 --> 01:18:57,224
Let's just say
you do your best thinking

755
01:18:57,226 --> 01:18:59,226
when you're not
thinking at all.

756
01:18:59,228 --> 01:19:00,294
All right, now hold still.

757
01:19:00,296 --> 01:19:02,563
Hey. What are you doing?

758
01:19:02,565 --> 01:19:05,702
We need water,
and you're the closest source.

759
01:19:06,703 --> 01:19:08,337
Now, hold still.

760
01:19:14,477 --> 01:19:15,511
Hmm.

761
01:19:44,507 --> 01:19:45,641
Show-off.

762
01:19:46,509 --> 01:19:48,143
I could have just peed on it.

763
01:19:58,588 --> 01:19:59,755
King Atlan.

764
01:20:01,757 --> 01:20:06,894
<i>In this trident
resides the power of Atlantis.</i>

765
01:20:06,896 --> 01:20:10,798
<i>In the wrong hands,
it would bring destruction.</i>

766
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,067
<i>But in the hands
of the true heir,</i>

767
01:20:13,069 --> 01:20:17,170
<i>it would unite all our
kingdoms above and below.</i>

768
01:20:17,172 --> 01:20:22,108
<i>If you seek my power,
you must prove your worth.</i>

769
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:25,645
<i>Journey beyond the edge of
the world to the Hidden Sea.</i>

770
01:20:25,647 --> 01:20:28,915
<i>Look inside the bottle
for the charted path.</i>

771
01:20:28,917 --> 01:20:34,656
<i>Only in the hands of the
true king can he truly see.</i>

772
01:20:42,897 --> 01:20:44,198
Hmm.

773
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:52,239
We can't let Orm find this.

774
01:20:54,676 --> 01:20:55,843
Hey! Wait!

775
01:20:56,946 --> 01:20:58,479
What?

776
01:20:58,481 --> 01:21:00,279
Shouldn't we have
written it down first?

777
01:21:00,281 --> 01:21:02,384
I memorized it. Didn't you?

778
01:21:03,986 --> 01:21:05,554
Oh, yeah. Totally.

779
01:21:07,123 --> 01:21:08,423
What'd he just say?

780
01:21:10,258 --> 01:21:12,460
"Something something trident."

781
01:21:26,741 --> 01:21:29,711
"Look inside the bottle
for the charted path."

782
01:21:35,884 --> 01:21:37,686
It's our next stop.

783
01:23:11,478 --> 01:23:14,379
I'm starting to think you actually
like these surface-dwellers.

784
01:23:14,381 --> 01:23:17,317
It would be wrong to judge a
place I've never seen before.

785
01:23:19,453 --> 01:23:21,923
I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

786
01:23:41,075 --> 01:23:44,943
Well, apparently, it's just right
up on the hill. A big old castle.

787
01:23:44,945 --> 01:23:47,815
And I just learned something
very interesting.

788
01:23:50,384 --> 01:23:54,287
You risked our lives based on something
you read in a children's book?

789
01:23:54,289 --> 01:23:57,589
Wait, it's a book?
How about that?

790
01:23:57,591 --> 01:23:58,990
Oh!

791
01:23:58,992 --> 01:24:00,392
I got it from the movie.

792
01:24:05,899 --> 01:24:09,333
King Nereus,
I had hoped our people had evolved

793
01:24:09,335 --> 01:24:11,502
beyond that ancient notion

794
01:24:11,504 --> 01:24:13,738
that war with the surface
is inevitable.

795
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:16,574
It is the position
of the Fishermen

796
01:24:16,576 --> 01:24:19,845
that when the time comes to make
ourselves known to the landsmen,

797
01:24:19,847 --> 01:24:23,717
it should be to educate them,
not to destroy them.

798
01:24:25,018 --> 01:24:27,788
I admire your lofty
aspirations, King Ricou.

799
01:24:31,524 --> 01:24:36,527
But I suspect they are but clouds
of ink hiding the heart of a coward.

800
01:24:36,529 --> 01:24:39,064
How dare you!

801
01:24:40,933 --> 01:24:43,235
Please. I implore you.

802
01:24:43,237 --> 01:24:47,037
You're a kingdom of bloated
philosophers and flaccid poets

803
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:50,574
whose waters have grown
stagnant, and it sickens me.

804
01:24:59,186 --> 01:25:00,685
My King!

805
01:25:00,687 --> 01:25:04,458
The king is dead!
Long live his heir.

806
01:25:06,193 --> 01:25:07,427
Princess.

807
01:25:08,428 --> 01:25:12,030
Prepare your armies,
Your Highness.

808
01:25:12,032 --> 01:25:15,569
We move against
the Brine Kingdom at once.

809
01:25:23,043 --> 01:25:25,110
What did
the recording say, again?

810
01:25:25,112 --> 01:25:28,079
"Journey beyond the edge
of the world to the Hidden Sea.

811
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:30,181
"Look in the bottle
for the charted path.

812
01:25:30,183 --> 01:25:34,487
"Only in the hands of the
true king can he truly see."

813
01:25:36,189 --> 01:25:39,159
"Look in the bottle
for the charted path."

814
01:25:41,128 --> 01:25:42,461
Hmm.

815
01:25:44,298 --> 01:25:45,831
Oh, man.

816
01:25:46,366 --> 01:25:47,564
What?

817
01:25:47,566 --> 01:25:49,934
Wow.
That's awesome.

818
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:51,103
Let me see.

819
01:25:52,471 --> 01:25:54,672
Wow. But how do you know
where to point it?

820
01:25:54,674 --> 01:25:56,207
Here, let me see.

821
01:25:56,209 --> 01:25:57,908
What was the last line?

822
01:25:57,910 --> 01:26:01,379
"Only in the hands of the
true king can he truly see."

823
01:26:01,381 --> 01:26:03,115
"Only in the hands
of the true..."

824
01:26:04,583 --> 01:26:06,717
Marcus Agrippa.

825
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:08,688
He was a great general,
but he wasn't a king.

826
01:26:10,556 --> 01:26:12,058
Neither was Scipio.

827
01:26:13,359 --> 01:26:15,025
How do you know
all this stuff?

828
01:26:15,027 --> 01:26:17,127
Because of my pops.
He made sure I knew my history.

829
01:26:17,129 --> 01:26:23,434
None of these guys are kings,
except this guy. Romulus.

830
01:26:23,436 --> 01:26:25,470
First king of Rome.

831
01:26:27,539 --> 01:26:30,709
"Only in the hands of the
true king can he truly see."

832
01:26:40,685 --> 01:26:42,685
There it is.
That's our heading.

833
01:26:42,687 --> 01:26:44,656
What? Let me see.

834
01:26:46,891 --> 01:26:48,058
We did it!

835
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:49,228
Oh!

836
01:26:51,029 --> 01:26:52,998
That's not bad
for an imbecile, huh?

837
01:26:55,268 --> 01:26:56,702
Not bad at all.

838
01:27:10,484 --> 01:27:11,784
Mera.

839
01:27:13,619 --> 01:27:19,456
"Loathsomeness
waits and dreams in the deep,

840
01:27:19,458 --> 01:27:24,730
"and decay spreads over
the tottering cities of men."

841
01:27:28,434 --> 01:27:29,667
Get back!

842
01:27:35,107 --> 01:27:36,275
Arthur!

843
01:27:39,178 --> 01:27:40,878
I order you to stand down!

844
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:43,082
<i>Princess Mera,
you've been charged with high treason.</i>

845
01:28:03,402 --> 01:28:04,734
Who the hell are you?

846
01:28:04,736 --> 01:28:06,938
Maybe this will
jog your memory.

847
01:28:54,819 --> 01:28:56,986
You're the guy from the sub.

848
01:28:56,988 --> 01:28:58,422
That's right.

849
01:28:59,791 --> 01:29:02,228
But now I have
Atlantean steel.

850
01:29:07,866 --> 01:29:10,835
Call me "Black Manta."

851
01:29:25,917 --> 01:29:28,119
You thought
you could walk away?

852
01:29:33,992 --> 01:29:35,894
I thought I told you
not to make this a habit.

853
01:29:56,514 --> 01:29:57,814
You can't run.

854
01:29:58,616 --> 01:30:00,882
You owe me blood!

855
01:30:00,884 --> 01:30:02,552
How'd you find me?

856
01:30:02,554 --> 01:30:06,823
Your lady friend has people
who like to keep tabs on her.

857
01:31:23,568 --> 01:31:24,768
No!

858
01:31:59,169 --> 01:32:00,170
Come on.

859
01:32:04,807 --> 01:32:06,675
Everybody, inside.
Get inside.

860
01:32:11,748 --> 01:32:15,849
I'll show you the
same mercy you showed my father.

861
01:32:15,851 --> 01:32:18,687
And gut you
like the fish you are!

862
01:34:13,869 --> 01:34:15,402
Arthur!

863
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:21,542
Mera, they're tracking you.

864
01:34:21,544 --> 01:34:22,676
What?

865
01:34:22,678 --> 01:34:24,413
They're tracking you.

866
01:34:35,223 --> 01:34:38,393
Arthur, stay with me.

867
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:42,130
Arthur, wake up! Arthur.

868
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:32,113
Um...

869
01:35:33,682 --> 01:35:35,314
Did you steal a boat?

870
01:35:35,316 --> 01:35:38,451
Are the boats at the marina
not for public use?

871
01:35:38,453 --> 01:35:41,622
No, those belong to people.

872
01:35:41,624 --> 01:35:43,422
Huh.

873
01:35:45,193 --> 01:35:46,927
Those were
Orm's elite commandos.

874
01:35:46,929 --> 01:35:50,229
But the one who led them,
he wasn't Atlantean.

875
01:35:50,231 --> 01:35:52,598
I've never seen him before.

876
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:54,267
Yeah, I have.

877
01:35:54,269 --> 01:35:56,771
He and his father
were pirates.

878
01:35:58,239 --> 01:36:00,806
And he blames me
for his father's death.

879
01:36:00,808 --> 01:36:05,380
They picked a dangerous line of trade.
It's not your fault.

880
01:36:06,214 --> 01:36:08,149
That's not how it feels.

881
01:36:10,184 --> 01:36:14,153
It was up to me,
and I let him die.

882
01:36:14,155 --> 01:36:17,055
I could've saved him,
but I didn't.

883
01:36:17,057 --> 01:36:21,027
And now, I made an enemy,
and he could have hurt you.

884
01:36:21,029 --> 01:36:22,530
And that would
have been my fault.

885
01:36:24,432 --> 01:36:26,534
Well, he's behind us now.

886
01:36:27,769 --> 01:36:30,371
It's what lies ahead
that should concern us.

887
01:36:31,973 --> 01:36:35,309
The charted path leads
to the Kingdom of the Trench.

888
01:36:36,945 --> 01:36:39,379
Are those the same creatures
that killed my mother?

889
01:36:40,014 --> 01:36:41,379
Yes.

890
01:36:41,381 --> 01:36:43,481
She was taken there
and sacrificed to them.

891
01:36:43,483 --> 01:36:45,651
It's become a place of death.

892
01:36:45,653 --> 01:36:47,855
We know next to nothing
about what's down there.

893
01:36:51,993 --> 01:36:54,226
We should turn back.

894
01:36:54,228 --> 01:36:57,030
We can still warn the surface.
Try and prepare them for what's coming.

895
01:36:57,032 --> 01:36:58,631
Turn back?

896
01:36:58,633 --> 01:37:02,668
Look, I learned from a young
age not to show weakness.

897
01:37:02,670 --> 01:37:05,906
Okay? I solve my problems
with my anger and my fists.

898
01:37:05,908 --> 01:37:08,908
I'm a blunt instrument,
and I'm damn good at it.

899
01:37:08,910 --> 01:37:13,379
But I've done nothing but get
my ass kicked this whole trip.

900
01:37:13,381 --> 01:37:16,415
I'm no leader.
I'm not a king.

901
01:37:16,417 --> 01:37:20,152
I do not work
or play well with others.

902
01:37:20,154 --> 01:37:24,857
And I can't let you die trying to
turn me into something that I'm not.

903
01:37:24,859 --> 01:37:29,562
You think you're unworthy to lead
because you're of two different worlds.

904
01:37:29,564 --> 01:37:32,698
But that is exactly
why you are worthy.

905
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:35,436
You are the bridge
between land and sea.

906
01:37:39,272 --> 01:37:40,775
The only question is...

907
01:37:43,511 --> 01:37:44,679
Can you?

908
01:37:59,961 --> 01:38:03,764
The tracking on Lady Mera
is still dark, Your Highness.

909
01:38:04,798 --> 01:38:06,266
Vulko.

910
01:38:07,035 --> 01:38:08,901
My trusted vizier

911
01:38:08,903 --> 01:38:12,572
who has stood by the throne
since my father sat upon it.

912
01:38:14,641 --> 01:38:17,542
Have you any advice for me
as this war begins?

913
01:38:17,544 --> 01:38:20,679
I have already
given it, My King.

914
01:38:20,681 --> 01:38:24,184
But I will stand
by your decision, as always.

915
01:38:24,818 --> 01:38:26,353
My decision.

916
01:38:28,321 --> 01:38:29,723
To protect it.

917
01:38:32,125 --> 01:38:33,493
While you betray it.

918
01:38:34,661 --> 01:38:38,195
You think I do not know
of your treachery?

919
01:38:38,197 --> 01:38:43,501
That you have remained loyal
to my mother's bastard son.

920
01:38:43,503 --> 01:38:48,942
That you have spent years training
him to take the throne from me.

921
01:38:51,945 --> 01:38:53,613
Do not deny it.

922
01:38:56,751 --> 01:38:57,885
I do not.

923
01:38:58,485 --> 01:38:59,754
Why?

924
01:39:01,254 --> 01:39:04,123
I am the pureblood.

925
01:39:04,125 --> 01:39:07,159
I have devoted my life
to Atlantis.

926
01:39:07,161 --> 01:39:10,662
He wanted nothing to do with it.
You swore to serve the throne!

927
01:39:10,664 --> 01:39:11,663
I do serve it.

928
01:39:11,665 --> 01:39:14,332
Arthur may only be
half-Atlantean,

929
01:39:14,334 --> 01:39:18,472
but he's already twice
the king you'll ever be.

930
01:39:24,778 --> 01:39:26,246
Take him.

931
01:39:27,447 --> 01:39:29,416
But make sure he has a view.

932
01:41:10,549 --> 01:41:12,183
What the hell
are these things?

933
01:41:12,185 --> 01:41:14,020
The Trench! We're here!

934
01:41:16,555 --> 01:41:18,490
- There are too many of them!
- Come on, inside!

935
01:41:28,968 --> 01:41:30,033
They're from the depths.

936
01:41:30,035 --> 01:41:31,704
They're scared
of the light. Here!

937
01:41:44,049 --> 01:41:45,451
Come on!

938
01:41:50,155 --> 01:41:51,523
You ready to jump?

939
01:43:00,426 --> 01:43:02,061
Over there!

940
01:43:36,694 --> 01:43:38,694
That thing
will tear us apart.

941
01:43:38,696 --> 01:43:40,531
We don't have a choice!

942
01:44:00,451 --> 01:44:02,153
Arthur!

943
01:44:05,423 --> 01:44:06,624
Mera!

944
01:44:37,854 --> 01:44:38,922
Mera!

945
01:44:40,057 --> 01:44:41,058
Mera!

946
01:45:02,713 --> 01:45:03,915
Mera!

947
01:45:06,918 --> 01:45:07,919
Mera!

948
01:45:52,162 --> 01:45:53,331
Arthur.

949
01:45:54,231 --> 01:45:55,632
Mom?

950
01:46:33,802 --> 01:46:38,540
King Orvax sacrificed
me to the Trench, but I survived.

951
01:46:38,542 --> 01:46:42,009
I fought my way through as you
did, and I ended up here.

952
01:46:42,011 --> 01:46:43,844
You've been here
alone for 20 years?

953
01:46:43,846 --> 01:46:45,313
Yes.

954
01:46:45,315 --> 01:46:46,815
Come. Sit here.

955
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:54,323
You must forgive me.

956
01:46:54,325 --> 01:46:56,958
Forgive me for everything.

957
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:59,461
This happened
because you had me.

958
01:46:59,463 --> 01:47:04,332
Not for having you.
None of this is your fault.

959
01:47:04,334 --> 01:47:07,235
I made a choice.
I had to leave...

960
01:47:07,237 --> 01:47:11,341
To save you,
to save your father.

961
01:47:13,743 --> 01:47:16,313
Tell me. Tell me about him.

962
01:47:16,746 --> 01:47:18,148
Is he...

963
01:47:21,918 --> 01:47:24,387
He still walks
to the end of that dock.

964
01:47:26,223 --> 01:47:27,257
Every morning.

965
01:47:30,293 --> 01:47:31,760
Every day.

966
01:47:34,863 --> 01:47:36,366
Waiting for you.

967
01:47:43,973 --> 01:47:45,508
Why didn't you ever come back?

968
01:47:51,046 --> 01:47:55,283
Because the portal that brought
you here won't let us return.

969
01:47:55,285 --> 01:47:58,919
The trident
is the only way back.

970
01:47:58,921 --> 01:48:02,958
But it is guarded
by the Karathen.

971
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:07,729
The creature from our legends,
it's real.

972
01:48:07,731 --> 01:48:10,866
It lies beyond the waterfall.

973
01:48:14,937 --> 01:48:17,271
We'll go with you.
We can fight it together.

974
01:48:17,273 --> 01:48:18,640
No.

975
01:48:18,642 --> 01:48:20,474
It's too powerful.

976
01:48:20,476 --> 01:48:24,311
I've tried many times
over the years.

977
01:48:24,313 --> 01:48:27,916
The creature will only allow
the true king to pass.

978
01:48:30,818 --> 01:48:32,454
You're afraid.

979
01:48:35,224 --> 01:48:36,292
Yes.

980
01:48:37,792 --> 01:48:39,094
Good.

981
01:48:40,629 --> 01:48:42,031
You're ready.

982
01:48:43,299 --> 01:48:45,167
Atlantis has always
had a king.

983
01:48:46,934 --> 01:48:49,136
Now, it needs something more.

984
01:48:49,138 --> 01:48:51,273
But what could be
greater than a king?

985
01:48:51,774 --> 01:48:53,041
A hero.

986
01:48:54,810 --> 01:48:57,212
A king fights
only for his nation.

987
01:48:58,981 --> 01:49:01,250
You fight for everyone.

988
01:50:29,805 --> 01:50:35,574
You do not belong here.

989
01:50:35,576 --> 01:50:42,148
I have guarded the trident against
false kings since the beginning.

990
01:50:42,150 --> 01:50:44,550
And for a thousand years

991
01:50:44,552 --> 01:50:50,356
I have seen the greatest
champions try and fail.

992
01:50:50,358 --> 01:50:56,897
But never have I sensed one
as unworthy as you.

993
01:50:56,899 --> 01:51:04,136
You dare come here with
your tainted mongrel blood

994
01:51:04,138 --> 01:51:07,674
to claim Atlantis'
greatest treasure?

995
01:51:09,977 --> 01:51:11,212
So be it...

996
01:51:12,614 --> 01:51:14,382
Half-breed.

997
01:51:33,869 --> 01:51:37,069
You thought yourself worthy?

998
01:51:37,071 --> 01:51:40,206
You thought yourself a king?

999
01:51:40,208 --> 01:51:44,610
You dishonor this place
with your presence.

1000
01:51:44,612 --> 01:51:45,713
Stop!

1001
01:51:53,287 --> 01:51:57,957
You're right.
I am a half-breed mongrel.

1002
01:51:57,959 --> 01:52:00,893
But I did not come here
because I thought I was worthy.

1003
01:52:00,895 --> 01:52:02,795
I know I'm not.

1004
01:52:02,797 --> 01:52:06,866
You understand me?

1005
01:52:06,868 --> 01:52:08,634
I do.

1006
01:52:08,636 --> 01:52:15,443
No mortal has conversed
with me since King Atlan.

1007
01:52:16,544 --> 01:52:19,747
Who are you?

1008
01:52:20,548 --> 01:52:22,015
I'm nobody.

1009
01:52:24,217 --> 01:52:27,087
I came because
I had no choice.

1010
01:52:28,555 --> 01:52:33,159
I came to save my home
and the people that I love.

1011
01:52:35,262 --> 01:52:39,364
I came because the trident
is their only hope.

1012
01:52:39,366 --> 01:52:41,568
And if that's not
good enough...

1013
01:52:44,005 --> 01:52:45,572
Then screw you.

1014
01:52:47,507 --> 01:52:54,549
No man has ever freed
the trident from Atlan's grip.

1015
01:52:55,383 --> 01:52:58,584
Should he deem you unworthy...

1016
01:52:58,586 --> 01:53:03,956
Well, I haven't feasted
in eons,

1017
01:53:03,958 --> 01:53:07,160
and I am famished.

1018
01:54:37,050 --> 01:54:40,219
The one true king.

1019
01:54:52,564 --> 01:54:55,700
Remember, the Brine
are powerful, savage brutes,

1020
01:54:55,702 --> 01:55:00,238
but a swift assault aimed directly at
their leadership will turn the tide.

1021
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:02,073
Defeat the Brine King,

1022
01:55:02,075 --> 01:55:05,745
and you will command the greatest
military might on this planet.

1023
01:55:07,614 --> 01:55:09,616
Today, we unite our kingdoms.

1024
01:55:11,284 --> 01:55:12,886
Tomorrow,
we scorch the surface!

1025
01:55:14,186 --> 01:55:17,590
Rise, Atlantis!

1026
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:38,678
Death to the
Atlantean hagfish!

1027
01:55:43,883 --> 01:55:46,184
We will not bow to Atlantis.

1028
01:55:46,186 --> 01:55:50,723
We're gonna give them a fight
that they will never forget!

1029
01:56:57,157 --> 01:56:59,958
No! We need him!

1030
01:57:02,162 --> 01:57:03,760
Join me or die.

1031
01:57:03,762 --> 01:57:07,330
You expect me to address
you as Your Highness?

1032
01:57:07,332 --> 01:57:08,767
Not Your Highness.

1033
01:57:10,769 --> 01:57:12,337
Call me...

1034
01:57:13,038 --> 01:57:14,738
Ocean Master.

1035
01:57:14,740 --> 01:57:18,642
You can take my army,
you soft-bellied slug.

1036
01:57:18,644 --> 01:57:22,212
But you will never
have my allegiance!

1037
01:57:22,214 --> 01:57:23,482
So be it!

1038
01:57:55,346 --> 01:57:56,681
What the...

1039
01:58:31,983 --> 01:58:33,718
The king has risen.

1040
01:58:41,325 --> 01:58:43,493
Attack!

1041
02:00:42,245 --> 02:00:44,946
There are too many casualties.
We have to stop the fighting now.

1042
02:00:44,948 --> 02:00:48,284
I'll find my father.
But you must defeat Orm.

1043
02:00:49,618 --> 02:00:51,185
And what if I can't?

1044
02:00:51,187 --> 02:00:54,423
Last time,
he was in his element.

1045
02:00:54,425 --> 02:00:57,627
This time,
make him fight in yours.

1046
02:01:24,554 --> 02:01:26,488
Um...

1047
02:01:26,490 --> 02:01:29,759
- What was the plan, again?
- The plan is to not get killed.

1048
02:01:30,860 --> 02:01:33,596
Yeah, good plan.
Don't get killed.

1049
02:02:06,529 --> 02:02:08,563
The Trench!
He commands the Trench!

1050
02:02:08,565 --> 02:02:10,066
Impossible!

1051
02:02:26,915 --> 02:02:28,648
Stand down! Let her pass.

1052
02:02:28,650 --> 02:02:31,852
Please, Father,
he has the trident.

1053
02:02:31,854 --> 02:02:34,221
I know you think
this war is necessary,

1054
02:02:34,223 --> 02:02:36,790
but Arthur is king
by our most sacred law.

1055
02:02:36,792 --> 02:02:38,459
And if you turn your back
on that now,

1056
02:02:38,461 --> 02:02:40,760
then the Atlantis you're
fighting for is already dead.

1057
02:02:40,762 --> 02:02:43,830
It's true!
The half-breed wields King Atlan's trident.

1058
02:02:43,832 --> 02:02:45,100
He commands the sea!

1059
02:02:47,169 --> 02:02:49,238
Then that half-breed
is your king.

1060
02:04:06,381 --> 02:04:08,882
Vulko! Come on,
he needs our help!

1061
02:04:08,884 --> 02:04:10,783
We can't! Look.

1062
02:04:10,785 --> 02:04:12,421
The people must bear witness.

1063
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:21,029
That trident
doesn't change what you are.

1064
02:04:21,929 --> 02:04:23,465
A half-breed bastard.

1065
02:04:26,067 --> 02:04:29,404
Atlantis will never accept you
as its king.

1066
02:04:32,106 --> 02:04:33,475
Well, then by bloodshed...

1067
02:04:35,711 --> 02:04:37,745
Do the gods
make known their will.

1068
02:05:07,175 --> 02:05:09,478
Yield the throne. Yield it!

1069
02:06:45,305 --> 02:06:46,505
Finish it.

1070
02:06:46,507 --> 02:06:47,872
Yield the throne.

1071
02:06:47,874 --> 02:06:49,643
Mercy is not our way.

1072
02:06:51,244 --> 02:06:53,381
Maybe you haven't
noticed, brother...

1073
02:06:58,854 --> 02:07:00,720
But I'm not one of you.

1074
02:07:00,722 --> 02:07:01,956
Do it!

1075
02:07:04,191 --> 02:07:06,193
- Kill me!
- No!

1076
02:07:08,830 --> 02:07:10,531
That is enough killing.

1077
02:07:18,005 --> 02:07:19,373
Mother?

1078
02:07:19,907 --> 02:07:21,575
Oh, my son.

1079
02:07:30,718 --> 02:07:32,851
It's a long story.

1080
02:07:32,853 --> 02:07:34,388
I'll tell ya later.

1081
02:07:35,356 --> 02:07:36,624
Come on!

1082
02:07:43,163 --> 02:07:46,331
I don't understand.
We thought...

1083
02:07:46,333 --> 02:07:47,334
I know.

1084
02:07:47,902 --> 02:07:49,703
Arthur saved me.

1085
02:07:53,406 --> 02:07:55,676
- You're with him?
- I am.

1086
02:07:58,244 --> 02:08:03,347
You're both my children,
and I love you so much.

1087
02:08:03,349 --> 02:08:05,585
But you have been misguided.

1088
02:08:06,953 --> 02:08:11,022
Your father taught you
that there were two worlds.

1089
02:08:11,024 --> 02:08:12,891
He was wrong.

1090
02:08:12,893 --> 02:08:15,628
The land and the sea

1091
02:08:16,931 --> 02:08:18,465
are one.

1092
02:08:38,451 --> 02:08:39,586
My queen.

1093
02:08:42,689 --> 02:08:44,056
Vulko.

1094
02:08:46,359 --> 02:08:48,158
Take him.

1095
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:50,497
But make sure he has a view.

1096
02:08:57,505 --> 02:08:58,506
When you're ready,

1097
02:09:00,908 --> 02:09:02,308
let's talk.

1098
02:09:16,957 --> 02:09:21,092
People of Atlantis,
today began in bloodshed,

1099
02:09:21,094 --> 02:09:24,061
but let it end in joy.

1100
02:09:24,063 --> 02:09:28,599
I give you
King Arthur of Atlantis.

1101
02:09:28,601 --> 02:09:30,301
Hail to the king!

1102
02:09:30,303 --> 02:09:33,337
- Hail to the king!
- Hail to the king!

1103
02:09:41,381 --> 02:09:43,716
So, what do I do now?

1104
02:09:44,317 --> 02:09:46,118
Be their king.

1105
02:09:47,320 --> 02:09:48,686
Ooh.

1106
02:09:48,688 --> 02:09:50,790
This is gonna be fun.

1107
02:10:42,808 --> 02:10:45,709
You came back. You're back.

1108
02:10:45,711 --> 02:10:47,813
Yes. Yes.

1109
02:10:53,686 --> 02:10:56,589
<i>My father
was a lighthouse keeper.</i>

1110
02:10:57,390 --> 02:10:59,459
<i>My mother was a queen.</i>

1111
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:02,729
<i>They were never
meant to meet...</i>

1112
02:11:06,231 --> 02:11:08,635
<i>But their love
saved the world.</i>

1113
02:11:10,837 --> 02:11:13,436
<i>They made me what I am.</i>

1114
02:11:13,438 --> 02:11:17,142
<i>A son of the land,
and a king of the seas.</i>

1115
02:11:18,711 --> 02:11:20,747
<i>I am the protector
of the deep.</i>

1116
02:11:22,547 --> 02:11:23,615
<i>I am...</i>

1117
02:11:25,283 --> 02:11:27,252
<i>Aquaman.</i>

1118
02:14:36,240 --> 02:14:37,507
Hey!

1119
02:14:41,444 --> 02:14:42,978
<i>I spent 15 years</i>

1120
02:14:42,980 --> 02:14:45,346
<i>at the United States Institute
of Marine Science...</i>

1121
02:14:45,348 --> 02:14:48,516
- <i>Weren't you fired?</i>
- <i>...studying oceanic phenomenon,</i>

1122
02:14:48,518 --> 02:14:50,885
<i>and this is the most conclusive
evidence we have to date.</i>

1123
02:14:50,887 --> 02:14:54,456
<i>Deep-sea seismographs have recorded
explosions on the ocean floor.</i>

1124
02:14:54,458 --> 02:14:56,658
<i>We have satellite imagery</i>

1125
02:14:56,660 --> 02:14:59,027
<i>of debris from Atlantean warships
floating on the surface...</i>

1126
02:14:59,029 --> 02:15:00,829
- <i>Dr. Shin!</i>
- <i>Will you please let me finish?</i>

1127
02:15:00,831 --> 02:15:03,065
<i>Here we go again.
Atlantean?</i>

1128
02:15:03,067 --> 02:15:05,834
<i>Yes. The government
does not want us to know</i>

1129
02:15:05,836 --> 02:15:07,402
<i>about the threat
that exists right here...</i>

1130
02:15:07,404 --> 02:15:09,738
Yeah, I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

1131
02:15:21,986 --> 02:15:23,919
This is Atlantean technology,
isn't it?

1132
02:15:23,921 --> 02:15:26,054
Can you tell me
how you got this?

1133
02:15:26,056 --> 02:15:29,423
Sure. But first,

1134
02:15:29,425 --> 02:15:32,395
you gotta tell me
how to find him.
