1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,232
Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville!
Welcome to Jackass!

3
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,871
Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville,
and I'm about to rent a car.

4
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,950
- I have a reservation.
- I need a driver's licence and credit card.

5
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,836
I need a signature here that you'll use
your coverage instead of ours.

6
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,110
- Is that white one us?
- Yes.

7
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,108
We're gonna walk around it
and inspect it together.

8
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,871
Looks pretty good.

9
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,799
I'm just looking
for dents and major scratches.

10
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,232
- Ls not major, but I'll write it down.
- The little ding there?

11
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,998
We'll take care of her.

12
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,670
- Thank you.
- You have a good week.

13
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,277
We'll be doing a lot of work here today.

14
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,149
Trust us, we're gonna have fun.

15
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,033
I'm Johnny Knoxville. This is called
the "Rent-a-car Crash-up Derby".

16
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,758
Oh, fuck!

17
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,199
Oh, fuck!

18
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,556
We didn't reinforce the windshield.

19
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,959
- That fucker missed me by that.
- Thas why you got the roll bars.

20
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,713
Whose car is this?

21
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,469
This is your guys' car.
I rented it from you earlier.

22
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,158
- Yeah, I hit a dog.
- A dog, you call it.

23
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,313
Come on in.

24
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,592
I had an accident, as you can see.

25
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,634
When I drink, I just black out.

26
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,198
- Were you drinking?
- I had a little, to be honest.

27
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,075
- Is there any licence plates on it?
- There was.

28
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,556
Hopefully, you guys will incur
some of the cost,

29
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,116
'cause I rented it from you guys
fair and square.

30
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,993
I don't wanna get stuck with
the whole charge.

31
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,156
You will get stuck with it.

32
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,318
I don't think I should.
I think you should help.

33
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,717
No. You declined
any additional coverage.

34
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,480
Right there. You declined it.

35
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,638
- Thas just paperwork.
- Ls a legal contract.

36
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,913
I was... I had a few to drink
when I signed that, too.

37
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,272
- We'll have to get this worked out.
- You'll have to pay for that car.

38
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,119
- You have to help me.
- No, we don't...

39
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,949
I returned it with a full tank of gas.

40
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,196
You returned it demolished.

41
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,109
- Ls got a full tank.
- Thas the least of our worries.

42
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,757
This is an unmitigated outrage.
I've never seen anything like this.

43
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,590
- What does that mean?
- No one's ever done that.

44
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,672
- Well, I can't pay for it.
- You're gonna have to.

45
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,314
Well, I ain't.

46
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,399
I'll let you two work it out.
I'm gonna go outside,

47
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,512
but that car
is gonna have to be paid for.

48
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,111
F you!

49
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,912
Knoxville knocked my nuts in half!

50
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,274
This is "The Muscle Stimulator".

51
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,552
It hurts my teeth.

52
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,430
I can't even turn it off.

53
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,276
How's that supposed to help?

54
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,517
- OK, you ready?
- Yeah.

55
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,796
OK, I'm taking care of you.
Ls all right.

56
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,389
Ls cool. You cool?

57
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,478
Come on. Ease up. Daddy's got you.

58
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,069
Daddy's got you. Come on.

59
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,918
- You're gonna have tits of steel.
- You're so buff right now.

60
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,837
This goes on the gooch!
This goes on the gooch.

61
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,600
Who's gonna do the gooch?

62
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,392
In case you didn't know,

63
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,116
the gooch is the spot
between your balls and butthole.

64
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,675
- Does it smell?
- Smell it. Just smell it!

65
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,950
Ehren, smell it.

66
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,234
- Zap my nuts.
- Les get it over with.

67
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,352
- Are we ready?
- You're so gone.

68
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,749
- He likes it.
- He liked it.

69
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,516
Afternoon. How you doing?

70
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,672
Son of a bitch!

71
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,996
What happened?

72
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,760
Man!

73
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,353
Thas the best thing I've ever seen!

74
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,996
Oh, fuck, dude!

75
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,199
- Are you OK? Get over here!
- Help him, help him!

76
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,188
- Medic!
- No! Don't move him!

77
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,069
That had bad news written all over it.

78
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,432
- Thas the worst that could happen.
- Dunn can't drive for shit.

79
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,395
I don't know what happened. We went
in the air. The next thing I know

80
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,636
I'm just fucked.

81
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,991
Dude, you were hauling so much ass.

82
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,719
We're here in Tokyo,
and I feel like partying.

83
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,156
Hi, I'm Party Boy.

84
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,555
Can I try this?

85
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,753
Here we go. Ls my party music.

86
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,830
Like it?
That makes me want to party.

87
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,112
I feel like partying right now.

88
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,590
Thas what the big ones do.
Sometimes they take a while to...

89
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,233
Fuck!

90
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,194
Don't pull on it, man.
You can't pry his mouth open.

91
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,996
Ls slowly getting weightless.

92
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,431
- Is he opening?
- No, you're twisting him!

93
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,433
Oh, fuck!
He's got my nipple, dude.

94
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,030
- I know. Hang on.
- Hang on. Don't move.

95
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,791
- You little bastard!
- Look at the teeth marks.

96
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,396
Man...

97
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,516
I am Bunny Lifeguard. Any alligators
try to ruin our swimming,

98
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,996
I'll wrestle them down
and have my way with them.

99
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,988
If he falls near an alligator
and it grabs hold of him,

100
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,909
Steve-O will relax
and hope the alligator will release him.

101
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,915
I'm Steve-O.
This is "Alligator Tightrope".

102
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,715
- Oh, shit.
- There's no such thing as failure.

103
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,797
He got it.

104
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,993
One thing I know
is good tightrope-walking.

105
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,556
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

106
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,629
- Put the chicken on him!
- Yeah!

107
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,597
- Oh, shit.
- There you go.

108
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,836
- Keep going, Steve-O.
- Oh, shit!

109
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,235
Keep your head up.

110
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,718
- Stick the bones up your ass.
- Let them pull it out.

111
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,912
Stay there, don't move!

112
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,673
Don't look!

113
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,633
Don't move!

114
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,435
I ran straight into a crocodile.

115
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,316
Oh, my God!

116
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,069
- Why can't you walk on a tightrope?
- I don't know.

117
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,396
I thought you'd do it.

118
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,797
Yeah, I don't know, man.

119
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,788
I'm sure I could learn,
but today was my first try.

120
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,273
I'm Bam Margera,
and my parents are asleep.

121
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,473
Ls 12.42, and Phil has to be
at work at five in the morning.

122
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:28,232
He's trying to get a good nighs sleep,
and I'm gonna go wake his ass up.

123
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,830
I'm dying. Holy shit!

124
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,155
- Oh, my God. I don't believe this.
- Look at Phil's tummy.

125
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,556
Phil, you got to be up
at five in the morning.

126
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,830
Six o'clock I'll be at work.

127
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,910
Here he comes.

128
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,598
Christ, Bam!
I almost broke my leg getting out!

129
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,236
There's shit all over!
How am I going to work now?

130
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,995
That woman in the corner,
cold playin' the role

131
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,509
Leave her ass in the corner
till her feet get cold

132
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,109
Knowin' for a fact
that girl is whacked

133
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,709
If you hold your hand out
she'll turn her back

134
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,434
Better walk, don't talk
She's all pretend

135
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,596
Can't be her friend
unless you spend

136
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,078
Wall to wall, after all, get ready to throw
only money at the bitch

137
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,397
'Cause she thinks she's so-phisticated

138
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,638
So-phisticated

139
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,675
What are you doing?

140
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,317
I ought to arrest you with all that in
your clothes. Whas wrong with you?

141
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,308
- What are you talking about?
- Get this out of your pocket!

142
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,909
Thas all me.

143
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,759
What is this bullshit?!

144
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,070
- Those are my bananas.
- Don't come here no more!

145
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:14,355
Get out, and take the other stuff
out of your pockets. Get it all out.

146
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,279
- Thas how you treat an old man?
- Yeah, go.

147
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,359
An old man that steals.
I can't believe it.

148
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,390
What kind of games
are you playing? Get out!

149
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,476
- Get out!
- Goddammit!

150
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,830
What is wrong with you?!

151
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,076
Get out!

152
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,509
Quit playing!

153
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,959
- I was Lon Chaney's lover!
- Go back and love him.

154
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,192
We're gonna go to this hardware store
where they sell toilets.

155
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,038
I'm gonna take a shit.

156
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,949
I'm gonna shit my pants
before we get to that place.

157
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,392
- Dave, fight it.
- No jokes. I just wanna hold it in.

158
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,309
- Got to poo?
- Pretty much. Really bad.

159
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,911
Do you wanna ruin everything?
I swear to God... ls a problem.

160
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,351
Is this the worst
you've had to go boom-boom?

161
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,437
No. I shit my pants at the fair.

162
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,428
Dude, he's shitting right now!
Get out, get out!

163
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,073
Get out of the fucking car!

164
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,917
- What did I do?!
- Did you shit?

165
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,433
Oh, shit!
I'm taking a cab back to the hotel.

166
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,996
He just shat everywhere.

167
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,275
- Whas wrong, man?
- I had to sit there while he shat.

168
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,879
I need to go home right now.

169
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,150
Ls on my hand.

170
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,515
We have very...
What the hell are you doing?

171
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,996
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

172
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,350
I'm almost done.

173
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,075
I hope you aim to get that,
son of a bitch.

174
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,556
You got to clean it out, pal.

175
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,636
That is disgusting, man!

176
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,796
What a fucking fruit loop!

177
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,554
Want me to play back?

178
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,559
What the fuck!

179
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,389
- Got him!
- Turn around. Les see it.

180
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,038
Thas a good one.

181
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,675
I'm Ehren Mcghehey.
This is "The Mousetrap".

182
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,271
All right!

183
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,433
Come on.

184
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,470
Thas enough! Time!

185
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,673
The "Bungee Wedgie".

186
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,073
- This isn't gonna work.
- It might.

187
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,716
Whas gonna happen here?

188
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,549
I don't know, but is not
whas gonna be intended.

189
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,278
Raab's putting a bloody tampon on.

190
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,756
Thas a Courtney Love-sized
Maxi Pad.

191
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,076
This is worse than a hanging.

192
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,355
I'm Raab Himself,
and I'm a complete fucking idiot.

193
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,949
- We need another one.
- Do it again.

194
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,829
Hey, I'm Raab Himself,
and this is "Bungee Wedgie".

195
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,039
Is that your shitty ass?

196
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,949
Look at the bloody, shitty underpants.

197
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,754
I can't believe this!

198
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,235
We're in the Valley today
to do our own riot control test.

199
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,797
This is George Hruska. What do you
do and what are we doing here today?

200
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,436
I'm Vice President of Operations
with ALS Technologies.

201
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,714
We make less lethal ammunition.
We're a top US manufacturer.

202
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,629
We're going to shoot you
with one of our projectiles.

203
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:08,517
Ls called the Pen-Prevent.
Ls a 40-gram tail-stabilised bag.

204
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,951
Lll be travelling
about 250 feet per second.

205
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,957
Is that lethal?

206
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,913
Ls considered less lethal.

207
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,150
This morning I thought I was taking
the beanbag projectile in the chest,

208
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,237
but George's company said no way.

209
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,399
If it hits me in the heart,
I'm pretty much done with.

210
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,754
We wanna take every precaution
necessary to protect your vital organs.

211
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,918
- Are my intestines in that area?
- Think so.

212
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,997
Awesome.

213
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,431
Are you gonna take
some practice shots?

214
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,478
This is nothing to mess around with.

215
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,150
This is nothing for anybody
to throw in a 12-gauge shotgun

216
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,669
and think they could take it.

217
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,192
I'm doing this because I can do this
in a controlled state.

218
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,717
Safety's off.

219
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,395
Going hot.

220
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,992
- That really hurt.
- It looked like it hurt.

221
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,553
Oh, fuck!

222
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:03,550
Did you see the way I caught
that beanbag with my stomach?

223
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,719
Thas instinct. You can't teach that.

224
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,590
It hurts so much going from
a prone position to standing.

225
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,954
Ouch.

226
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,073
Hi, I'm Wee Man,
and this is a big cone.

227
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,836
Oh, my God! My brakes!

228
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,951
Oh, shit!

229
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,357
My brakes! My brakes!

230
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,074
My brakes!

231
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,953
Stop me! Stop me!

232
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,593
Stop me!

233
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,399
- You all right?
- That was so fast.

234
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,116
- Did your brakes go out?
- Yes. That whole thing doesn't work.

235
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,596
Will you push me to the top?
I wanna do it again.

236
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,670
I could sure go for
a Miller High Life.

237
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,039
Oh, you're in so much trouble.

238
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,314
Kick her ass!

239
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,269
I'm about to get ass-kicked by a girl.

240
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,233
Keep up the left!

241
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,792
And the winner...

242
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,788
...and still champion:
- Now pronounce her name!

243
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,117
His bloody mouthpiece.

244
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,756
My God, my jaw
is two inches to the left.

245
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,078
I felt all right for a bit,
until she punched me in the nose.

246
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,511
I knew she was fighting dirty.

247
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,354
- "Tropical Pole Vaulting."
- One, two, three, four!

248
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,239
- Go grab the dead kitty!
- I've been in there before. It sucks!

249
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,354
Oh, God!

250
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,957
We don't have
to bleep cuss words,

251
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:24,109
so I promise I will get my mom to say
"fuck" by the end of this movie.

252
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,430
I'm Johnny Knoxville.
We're about to test my rocket skates.

253
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,911
Go.

254
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,792
This is "Rocket Skates", take two.

255
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,038
- This one will be more powerful.
- These are different rockets?

256
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,912
No, there's more of them.

257
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,031
- Oh, fuck!
- Whas wrong?

258
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,950
I fell and busted my ass.
Thas whas fucking wrong.

259
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,030
Thas it.

260
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,595
No more rocket skates.

261
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,713
God! This party sucks!

262
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,995
- Hey, my man. Wasabi. Lots.
- Wasabi.

263
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,832
Yeah!

264
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,238
Today I'm gonna treat myself
to some wasabi snooters.

265
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,720
Little circles.

266
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,753
God! Chopsticks are so stupid!

267
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,839
Pretty good line.

268
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,516
More.

269
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,313
Do another snooter.

270
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,716
I need a pick-me-up.

271
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,749
This is bullshit!

272
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,638
Phil. Phil!

273
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,517
Phil. Hey, Phil!

274
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,314
Oh, my God.

275
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,719
Is this thing real?!

276
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,990
This alligator?!

277
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,590
- What?
- Look! Over there in the corner.

278
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,997
What is that?

279
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,875
Where have you been?
Don't you even look?

280
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,550
Oh, my God!
Ls moving. Oh, Phil!

281
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:28,949
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Aren't you scared to death?!

282
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,235
Ls so gross that is even on the floor.

283
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,273
I'm going out. Where's my keys?

284
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,790
That is the scariest fucking thing
I ever saw!

285
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,439
Don't leave. Where are you going?

286
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:50,589
Phil, help me get this thing
out of here! I'm scared to death!

287
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,353
Oh, God!

288
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,314
Oh, man!

289
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,478
No, no! I don't want it open!

290
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,229
No, no!
You don't have it, do you?

291
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,795
- No, we don't.
- Ls not there?

292
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,595
Seriously, is that real?
I'm serious. Is it real?

293
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,758
- Is it real?!
- Yeah.

294
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,599
I'm serious. I want it out!

295
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,073
Dude, wait, stop, chill!

296
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,517
Jason kicked your ass!

297
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,235
- I didn't even get you.
- You got beat up by Wee Man.

298
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,352
Let me see.
He didn't even get you.

299
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,758
- Where?
- He didn't even get you.

300
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,872
Let me see the back of your head.

301
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,832
- Oh!
- Lll be all right.

302
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,514
I'm here with Eric Koston
and Clyde Singleton.

303
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:02,271
Today I'm gonna 50-50 this rail,
or try to.

304
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,471
- This thing is long.
- Thanks.

305
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,955
Thanks for reminding me.

306
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,716
I got it. I got this.

307
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,710
- Is he gonna go?
- He's gonna go somewhere.

308
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,354
He's going, yeah.

309
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,519
My impression of Johnny Knoxville.
Something like this.

310
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,193
"Oh, my face!"

311
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,398
I'm Johnny Knoxville,
and I'm gonna grind this rail.

312
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,788
Ready, set, go.

313
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,958
He made it!
I can't believe he got that far.

314
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,675
You ran it to the fucking bottom!

315
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:27,317
This is the "Paper Cuts". I'm getting
paper cuts between my fingers and toes.

316
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,799
There's no good way to do it.
Just deal with it. Take a breath.

317
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:45,950
You can feel when it goes in. This
one works good. Give me the next.

318
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,196
Do it.

319
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:56,754
- Open up with a good one!
- Did you hear that?

320
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,757
That was my flesh!

321
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,713
If I do your hand,
you'll forget the pain in your foot.

322
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,273
Good point.

323
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,391
Take a deep breath.

324
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,470
Hey, Lance, are you going to puke?

325
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,238
He's gonna puke!

326
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,479
From what, the pepperoni
or the paper cuts? Both?

327
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,716
Pepperoni!

328
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,190
- Pig entrails?
- Ls showtime!

329
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,878
Is he OK?

330
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:41,516
- Lance, are you all right?
- Don't knock over the beer.

331
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,792
- Are you OK?
- No.

332
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,749
There's green spit everywhere.

333
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,032
Steve-O, if you wanna do
some more, do it. I'm done.

334
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,310
Is everybody ready?

335
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,716
That sucked!

336
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,914
Am I glad I came down to see
what was going on in this room.

337
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,718
Wait a minute.
I know what my fortune is.

338
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,480
Ls partying.

339
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,237
This is "Sweaty Fat Fucks".

340
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,268
Oh, honey. Ls been a while.

341
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,119
- Ls a little too much.
- No.

342
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,039
- You need to do it?
- You want a spot?

343
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,038
- No, I got it.
- You got it?

344
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,789
- You need a spot, give me a call.
- OK.

345
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,073
Whas the quickest
you've knocked anyone out?

346
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,671
I hold the California State record
of 18 seconds including the 10-count.

347
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,390
I think you'll break that today.

348
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,760
- I'm Johnny Knoxville.
- I'm Butterbean.

349
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,839
Today we're gonna do a little boxing.

350
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,111
Guys, touch gloves
and come out fighting.

351
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,073
Get up!

352
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,110
One more time.

353
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:11,278
This is the last time
you're kicking my ass.

354
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,552
More pain, thas it.

355
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,397
Hit me once, at least. There you go.

356
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,431
He's out.

357
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,029
Is Butterbean OK?

358
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,869
By knockout in the first round,
new champion: Butterbean.

359
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:05,230
- Where are we going, Knoxville?
- The hospital.

360
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,237
- Why?
- Don't know.

361
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,797
Apparently, I have a gash in my head,
and I'm a little concussed.

362
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,836
- Are you giving me a shot?
- Yeah. You OK?

363
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:22,909
We got one more to go, buddy.
Then you are a free man.

364
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,715
You're gonna be not feeling great
for the next 24 hours.

365
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:32,438
Thank you, doctor. You'll probably
see me in two or three days.

366
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:38,150
I, Sir Marcius, will never
pay you with cash, only with drugs!

367
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,230
- Goddammit, what are you doing?
- Whas going on?

368
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:08,712
We're in Okinawa and about to swim
with whale sharks, but first...

369
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,798
...we need to go rub one out.

370
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,796
I made the mistake of showing them

371
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,675
what sea cucumbers do
when they're threatened.

372
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:29,035
As soon as something touches them,
white threads come out of the end.

373
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:33,233
Steve-O and Chris thought
it was a great idea,

374
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,956
so they're out there
trying to masturbate.

375
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,470
Anyway, I apologise for this.

376
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:48,516
This is the "Whale Shark Gummer".

377
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:53,157
With a simple shave with a razor,
Steve-O easily disguises himself

378
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:58,036
to fool the whale sharks into
thinking he's a harmless young boy.

379
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,630
I am nervous about my wiener
around that whale shark.

380
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:05,992
The best way is to think
of whale sharks as big puppy dogs.

381
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:10,512
- Sometimes puppies bite.
- They have little teeth.

382
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,678
You're gonna get a gummer.

383
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,156
- Ls like being with a gal with no teeth.
- Kind of.

384
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:21,277
Below these waters,
30-foot whale sharks

385
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:26,190
are waiting to eat these frigging
shrimp out of our crotches.

386
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,555
They're kind of...
They pinch. Are these alive?

387
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,839
They don't feel good
all the way to your cock.

388
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,510
Look at this shrimp.

389
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,552
I don't have any last words.
I'll kill myself once I lose my wiener.

390
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:49,078
My penis is really small now.

391
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:54,468
I can't really look cool right now.

392
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,636
Hi, I'm Johnny Knoxville.
This is the "Tidal Wave".

393
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,397
- How did it look?
- Good.

394
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,390
- Look at this guy.
- Great.

395
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:34,509
I don't pick a tattoo unless I'm sure
people will laugh when they see it.

396
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,519
Oh, my God, dude.

397
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:51,757
How do you perform
the worlןs dumbest tattoo?

398
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:55,555
Fuck, man.
At least I don't have to look at it.

399
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:05,592
My name is Henry Rollins,
and this is "Off-road Tattoo"!

400
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:28,038
This is designed to fuck you up!

401
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,350
Christian motherfucker!

402
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,278
Ls a total smiley face, dude.

403
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:28,432
- This fool got a haircut a week ago.
- You're about to get many more.

404
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,795
Look at Ehren.

405
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,953
Oh, shit!

406
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,074
We're finding it chilly in Japan,

407
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:59,239
so we're gonna warm ourselves up
with some fireworks.

408
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,830
- Les go, dude.
- Roll back just a bit.

409
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:09,715
Oh, no. This is a bad angle.

410
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,350
An ember fell in my cornhole.

411
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:30,158
Double-knot it, but gently.

412
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:52,513
You may think this next stunt
is impossible.

413
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:56,599
You got to squat a little.

414
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,234
Every time...

415
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,318
Is Chris' dick shorter or...?

416
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:19,630
That almost hit Louis in the face!

417
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:32,310
Goddamn, this is
the "BMX Tug-of-war".

418
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,231
What a dumb-ass idea!

419
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:53,548
I'm surrounded by cacti,
for fuck's sake!

420
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,433
- Ls cacti!
- Cactus!

421
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,437
Whatever it is, it hurts!

422
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,429
You wanna get help across?

423
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,912
This is the "Yellow Snowcone".

424
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,636
Pack it in nice and tight.

425
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:46,636
A little cold out here, it might
take a second. There we go.

426
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,389
I'm not worried about the pee...

427
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:56,991
- You're missing the cone.
- I'm sorry.

428
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:05,830
You better eat that whole thing
and that spot, too.

429
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:09,077
Enjoy the snow cone.

430
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,350
You just wasted a whole bunch.

431
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:16,270
Get that whole mouthful.

432
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,040
- Keep going, eat it!
- Ls your pee!

433
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:21,959
- Come on!
- I'm trying. Ls so cold.

434
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:26,836
- Swallow it.
- Oh, God!

435
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:32,277
- No puking.
- I'm doing it!

436
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,758
Ls dripping out the bottom. Catch it!

437
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,672
Oh, my God!

438
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:56,040
That was bad!

439
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:02,632
Kick yourself in the head, Wee Man.

440
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:05,514
Are you starting to lose your mind?
You shit! Stop it!

441
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:09,076
Now you're getting crazy on this shit.

442
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:14,397
Hey! He's starting to lose it!

443
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,839
Jesus Christ!

444
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,111
I need toilet paper!

445
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,989
This is called the "Golf Course Airhorn".
When people tee off

446
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:30,432
and are coming down with their swing,
we'll blow these airhorns.

447
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:51,755
- Here she goes again.
- No? Is there another one?

448
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,951
She still hit it pretty good.

449
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:25,750
- What did I tell you?
- You lost your club. Sorry.

450
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:29,430
Didn't I tell you I'd come over
and kick your ass?

451
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:34,350
- Sorry, I've got bursitis.
- So you got to play with a horn?

452
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,154
- It helps.
- I'll give you something to play with.

453
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,590
Sorry. It won't happen again.

454
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,318
- Oh, fuck!
- He's teeing up.

455
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:10,434
- Get back! Get down!
- Watch this. Wait.

456
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:27,149
Oh, Jesus, you're scary!

457
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,070
- I'm Bam Margera.
- Johnny Knoxville.

458
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,953
We're gonna be burglars today.

459
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,239
Oh, God!

460
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:49,592
- Fuck! Get the diamonds!
- I told you not to fall off the beam!

461
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,553
Turn around! Fuck!

462
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:59,115
Holy fuck!

463
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,511
Idiot!

464
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:09,079
Holy fuck!

465
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:17,157
- You all right? You OK?
- I'm good.

466
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,555
What did you think happened?

467
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:24,390
I wasn't halfway through the ceiling
and you were already out the door.

468
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,909
You're an Olympic sprinter!

469
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:31,955
Dude, guys in masks, I'm out.
I don't quit!

470
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,475
Is there any actual real reason...

471
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,592
...one would shove this up their ass?
- No.

472
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:45,588
- I'm claiming predictions for this event.
- Where's Ryan?

473
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,438
1: ls not getting in there.

474
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:51,872
2: If it does, is not staying.
Definitely no sitting down.

475
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,629
3: No way they'll believe this is true.

476
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,308
So you're saying is...

477
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:02,149
There's nothing I want more
than for this to happen, but...

478
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,669
- You didn't want it that much.
- I really do.

479
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,555
This is our original talent
for this piece, by the way.

480
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,830
The first thing you've ducked out of.

481
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:17,354
Man, I'm so glad
I turned this idea down.

482
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:23,197
I'll probably use all of this
before the end of the segment.

483
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:29,350
What else have we got?
A condom. Thank you.

484
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:35,078
A little toy car. Blue.
Ls my favourite colour.

485
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,037
Les see it dangling.

486
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,999
Look at the reservoir tip.

487
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:49,479
Now I'm lubing up the little toy car,

488
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:53,195
because I'm going to put it in my butt.

489
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:58,795
Be comfortable.

490
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,869
Eןs here for rescuing, dude.
You're here for making it a problem.

491
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:08,471
- You watching is uncomfortable.
- I got to get another job.

492
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:12,958
- Lube up your cornhole.
- I am. I'm spackling.

493
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:18,552
- Heart rate's going up, for sure.
- Adrenaline's flowing, isn't it?

494
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,751
It hurts like hell.

495
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,873
Come on in, Manny.
You're just in time.

496
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:28,993
Manny, tell me I'm a man.

497
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:33,748
It feels so goddamn gross.

498
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:37,635
This is insane. Ls totally insane.

499
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,673
- Ls in.
- Ls in?

500
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,998
Oh, fuck!
I feel like I have to shit my ass!

501
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:48,112
Is there anything to tap?

502
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:55,351
You said you didn't wanna do it
because your dad would disown you.

503
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:59,155
- It wasn't that.
- You drank wine off a dude's ass crack!

504
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:03,273
But Dad never saw that.
I never told him that.

505
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,835
I was gonna do this and I was like,

506
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:11,160
"Dad, we're going hard these days.
There's ideas floating around."

507
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:15,638
I mentioned the car in the butt,
and it was the only time in my life

508
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:22,154
I heard my dad say, "I'm not mad
at you, I'm just disappointed."

509
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:25,352
That hurt so much more.

510
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:32,076
- Look at him walk.
- Dunn's gonna win, dude.

511
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:36,796
I'm not too excited about this skit,
because there's a toy car in my butt,

512
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,514
but this is the "Butt X-ray".

513
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:48,313
I think I need an X-ray.

514
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,991
- How are you doing?
- Pretty good.

515
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,475
- I'm Ryan.
- What can I do for you?

516
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:59,797
I was partying last night
with some frat guys. I passed out.

517
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,788
I must have broken something,
'cause I can't walk right.

518
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,434
We're gonna take X-ray now.

519
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,959
- This is comfy.
- Hold your breath.

520
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:30,117
I can't tell you, he's there.

521
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:57,679
- Whas that?
- No idea.

522
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:01,236
Thas not part of you.
Thas something extra.

523
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:06,116
- I woulןve known if I ate that.
- You wouldn't be able to swallow that.

524
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:10,108
- That is a car toy.
- How did a car toy get there?

525
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:14,154
- Maybe you stuck it up your ass.
- I didn't do that.

526
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,157
You ever seen anything like that?

527
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,999
I've never seen that in there.

528
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:23,671
I'd say is a toy car.
Never in somebody's rectum.

529
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:26,474
- You can't get it out?
- No.

530
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:31,276
I'm a physician.
I practise this. X-ray only.

531
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:34,392
You think I can just poop it out?

532
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:39,071
You won't be able to poop it out.
It will hurt you.

533
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:43,239
I don't think is even good for you
that you poop it out.

534
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,830
What will happen if he takes Ex-Lax?
Will that help?

535
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:51,352
No. He gets a lot of diarrhoea,
but no car.

536
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:05,557
I appreciate it.
Thank you for taking care of me.

537
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:24,077
He's alive! Johnny Knoxville!
He made it!

538
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,919
There is a God!

539
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:31,476
At last, I thought it would never...

540
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:36,549
This is the end!
Thank you, Jesus!

541
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:48,669
Subtitle arrangement:
Plavi-G@Avgust 2003

542
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:24,590
Whose dick do I got to suck
to get some explosions?

543
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,394
Gator wrestling!

544
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,629
For fuck's sake, come here!
Hurry up!

545
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,876
Hurry!

546
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:06,399
We wanted to see if you would run.

547
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,795
I ain't running anywhere.

548
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,358
Scary enough to walk.

549
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,596
You're nice. You're a good man.
Wanna come over for dinner?

550
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,758
Ls OK.
Do you know how to operate it now?

551
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:24,076
Yeah, I think so.

552
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,669
I need help.

553
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,633
The smiley face is a complete crucial...

554
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,430
- What did I say?
- "Fuck."

555
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,710
- I didn't say the F-word?
- You did.

556
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:56,310
- Don't worry. We'll bleep it.
- Can we cut that out?

557
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:13,116
I think it says "fuck" on my forehead.

558
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,709
- Did you know I had a tail?
- No.

559
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,990
They must have taken it
from somewhere...

560
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,710
I can't believe you did that.

561
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,480
Show him the X-ray.

562
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:37,032
Trust me, dude. I'm not unimpressed.

563
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:00,196
Oh, fuck!

564
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:06,238
The next time
we could do "Son of Jackass".

565
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:11,720
Yeah, dude!

566
01:24:12,305 --> 01:25:12,176
