<i>It's simple at first.</i>

4
00:00:39,074 --> 00:00:41,537
<i>Home is the only place
you know.</i>

5
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:43,606
<i>And everyone there
is your family.</i>

6
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,737
<i>My first home
was full of cats.</i>

7
00:00:48,973 --> 00:00:50,338
<i>And I'm a dog.</i>

8
00:00:53,506 --> 00:00:56,838
<i>Cats had sharp claws
and made a funny tummy sound</i>

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,238
<i>when they were happy.</i>

10
00:01:02,106 --> 00:01:05,205
<i>The kittens had a mother cat.</i>

11
00:01:05,207 --> 00:01:07,407
<i>And I had a mother dog.</i>

12
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,175
<i>I couldn't imagine that
life could get any better.</i>

13
00:01:20,806 --> 00:01:23,740
<i>As I grew, we made
a home together.</i>

14
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,570
<i>We were happy</i>

15
00:01:28,572 --> 00:01:29,773
<i>for a while.</i>

16
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,239
Oh, wow.
Look at all of 'em.

17
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:37,505
You didn't tell me
there were so many.

18
00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:38,572
Just grab 'em!

19
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,305
- Hey!
- Found one. I got one over here.

20
00:01:41,307 --> 00:01:42,472
Geez, they're fast.

21
00:01:42,474 --> 00:01:44,138
I got one.

22
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,238
- Over there. Over there.
- Come here.

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,405
Hey, hey. There's dogs here, too.

24
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:50,505
Brother!

25
00:01:50,507 --> 00:01:51,774
A whole bunch
of 'em back here.

26
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:56,206
- Got another one.
- Sister!

27
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,105
Got it.

28
00:01:59,573 --> 00:02:00,807
There's
a full-grown pit bull.

29
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:08,907
Here we go.

30
00:02:10,641 --> 00:02:11,607
Easy.

31
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:14,573
Easy.

32
00:02:20,906 --> 00:02:22,007
Got her.

33
00:02:22,506 --> 00:02:23,738
Mother!

34
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:27,107
- I'm going out.
- Come on.

35
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,241
Get a bigger crate.

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,741
Coming out.

37
00:02:42,873 --> 00:02:45,737
Mother?

38
00:02:50,073 --> 00:02:52,340
<i>I never saw her again.</i>

39
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,372
<i>I don't know what
would have happened to me</i>

40
00:03:15,374 --> 00:03:16,671
<i>without Mother Cat.</i>

41
00:03:30,674 --> 00:03:32,241
<i>And day by day,</i>

42
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,373
<i>little by little,</i>

43
00:03:37,707 --> 00:03:40,474
<i>Mother Cat became my mother.</i>

44
00:03:48,673 --> 00:03:51,139
- Hey.
- Hey.

45
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:53,541
It's just here.

46
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,539
Okay. We left work early
so we could be basically,

47
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,405
what, breaking and entering?

48
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,072
It's not breaking
and entering, Olivia.

49
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:04,338
It's criminal trespass.
There's a difference.

50
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,272
Okay, so, like, two years
in prison instead of six. Got it.

51
00:04:07,274 --> 00:04:09,072
- I'm good, I'm good.
- Anyway, come on.

52
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:12,338
Can't say that a guy
rescuing kittens isn't hot.

53
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,204
Oh, I'm not saying that.
I'm just saying you're not hot.

54
00:04:15,206 --> 00:04:18,039
Oh, thanks. Here.

55
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,371
- Come on. They're under here.
- Okay. Seriously?

56
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:22,238
Lucas, I'm not going
in that hole.

57
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,038
Well, you're
the animal rescue volunteer.

58
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,337
- Okay.
- You don't have to crawl in.

59
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:28,039
Just take a look.

60
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,370
- Wow. There's so many of 'em.
- Yeah.

61
00:04:30,372 --> 00:04:32,537
Apparently,
Animal Control came,

62
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,604
but they didn't get 'em all.

63
00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:37,337
And now, the builder says he's
gonna tear down the whole block,

64
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:39,772
cats or no cats.

65
00:04:39,774 --> 00:04:42,938
<i>Men took my dog family,
but this man named Lucas was different.</i>

66
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,972
- <i>He came every day...</i>
- Hey.

67
00:04:44,974 --> 00:04:47,008
<i>And the cats trusted him.</i>

68
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:51,539
Come on.

69
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,873
<i>And before I could even
think, my paws were moving.</i>

70
00:04:54,572 --> 00:04:55,573
Wait!

71
00:04:58,707 --> 00:05:01,404
Lucas!
Look, a puppy!

72
00:05:01,406 --> 00:05:02,541
Oh, my God.

73
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,440
Hey. What are you doing
here, baby... Girl?

74
00:05:09,106 --> 00:05:11,437
Hey.

75
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,206
<i>And he
tasted good, too.</i>

76
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,337
She is really cute.

77
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:17,470
- Hi.
- Hey.

78
00:05:17,472 --> 00:05:20,238
It will not be hard
finding you a home.

79
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,237
Well, wait.

80
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,171
I mean,
you saw how she ran right to me.

81
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:26,504
Maybe that's a sign that her
home's supposed to be with me.

82
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:29,403
Lucas, you cannot
take care of a dog, okay?

83
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:32,871
What do you do when you
go to school or the VA?

84
00:05:32,873 --> 00:05:34,907
Listen, I actually
live with my mom.

85
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:39,205
It's not how it sounds.
It... She's a veteran.

86
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:41,270
You might have
seen her at the VA.

87
00:05:41,272 --> 00:05:42,904
- Terri Ray?
- Yeah.

88
00:05:42,906 --> 00:05:45,171
Well, she isn't able
to hold down a job just yet,

89
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:48,139
so, she's at home
even when I'm not.

90
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:51,804
Listen, maybe a puppy
would be good for her, too.

91
00:05:51,806 --> 00:05:54,303
<i>Nothing had ever felt
as good as being held by him.</i>

92
00:05:54,305 --> 00:05:56,304
She does really seem
to like you a lot.

93
00:05:57,807 --> 00:05:59,274
What do you see in him
that I don't, puppy?

94
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,705
Hey, you!
Get out of there!

95
00:06:05,707 --> 00:06:06,837
- Go, go, go.
- Go, go. Keep going.

96
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,404
Private property!

97
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,072
- I'll see you later, okay?
- All right.

98
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,441
- Yeah. Bye.
- Call me.

99
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,204
Whoa! Oh!

100
00:06:26,206 --> 00:06:29,871
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

101
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:33,238
I think I'm gonna
call her Bella.

102
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,238
Honey, you know
we can't have a puppy.

103
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,737
Our lease says no pets.

104
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:38,838
They say a dog
is good for depression.

105
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,338
- Who says that?
- Oh, I'm pretty sure somebody says that.

106
00:06:45,007 --> 00:06:46,405
Is this gonna be one
of those things

107
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,638
I say is a terrible idea
and you do it, anyway?

108
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,339
Yeah. And who do you suppose
I learned that from?

109
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:57,440
<i>Lucas and I
played the best games.</i>

110
00:06:58,873 --> 00:07:01,638
Bella, get the ball.

111
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,174
<i>We played Get the Ball.</i>

112
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,604
Stop.

113
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:13,038
<i>We played Stop.</i>

114
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,640
Stop, Bella.
I have to study.

115
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,273
Here.

116
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,339
Have my blanket.

117
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:29,205
<i>It smelled amazing.
Just like Lucas.</i>

118
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:36,338
<i>We played Don't Chew Shoes.</i>

119
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,474
Bella. Don't chew shoes.

120
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:51,737
<i>And there was
my favorite game of all.</i>

121
00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:55,538
What? What do you want?

122
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,374
I'm trying to...

123
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:00,804
Oh.

124
00:08:00,806 --> 00:08:06,371
Do you want
a tiny piece of cheese?

125
00:08:06,373 --> 00:08:08,270
<i>Tiny Piece of Cheese
filled me</i>

126
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:10,271
- <i>with such a strong feeling.</i>
- There you go.

127
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:14,104
<i>Like I was safe and happy
and warm, all at once.</i>

128
00:08:14,106 --> 00:08:16,036
<i>It was love.</i>

129
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,203
I've gotta go, gotta go,
gotta go, gotta go!

130
00:08:18,205 --> 00:08:19,907
I'm so late.

131
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:26,604
Gotta go to work.
Bye, Bella.

132
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,538
<i>The one game I
didn't like was Go to Work.</i>

133
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,671
Be good.

134
00:08:31,673 --> 00:08:33,605
<i>My Lucas blanket
kept me company,</i>

135
00:08:33,607 --> 00:08:36,941
<i>but it wasn't the same
as the real Lucas.</i>

136
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,704
- <i>I still had my cat family.</i>
- Slow down there.

137
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:43,804
<i>And Lucas became</i>

138
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:44,904
- <i>part of that family, too.</i>
- No, this is not for you, Bella.

139
00:08:44,906 --> 00:08:45,606
This is for the cats.
Come here.

140
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,970
See 'em?

141
00:08:49,972 --> 00:08:52,170
Mother Cat!

142
00:08:52,172 --> 00:08:55,170
<i>I love Mother Cat,
and I love being Bella.</i>

143
00:08:57,172 --> 00:08:59,537
Come on.
We're going home.

144
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,838
As you were, cats.

145
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,071
- See you tomorrow.
- All right.

146
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:04,338
Bedtime, Bella. Come on.

147
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,238
<i>And at the end of
every day, we played...</i>

148
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,372
Sit. You ready for your

149
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:12,040
- tiny piece of cheese?
- <i>...Tiny Piece of Cheese.</i>

150
00:09:19,773 --> 00:09:21,972
All right. On your blanket.
Come on.

151
00:09:28,774 --> 00:09:30,505
Night, Bella.

152
00:09:30,507 --> 00:09:34,206
<i>Lucas was my person,
and I was his dog.</i>

153
00:09:35,873 --> 00:09:38,273
<i>I was home.</i>

154
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,238
<i>Whenever Lucas was playing</i>

155
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,705
- <i>Go to Work...</i>
- Good girl.

156
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,871
<i>...I would take
Mom for a walk.</i>

157
00:09:44,873 --> 00:09:47,471
- What is it, honey?
- It's that squirrel again!

158
00:09:47,473 --> 00:09:49,136
I have to have
that squirrel.

159
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:50,970
It's getting away!

160
00:09:50,972 --> 00:09:52,971
- Bella. No, Bella.
- Oh, it's right there!

161
00:09:52,973 --> 00:09:54,203
Come on, girl.
No squirrel chasing.

162
00:09:54,205 --> 00:09:56,238
Come on, Bella.
Come on, girl.

163
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,872
<i>I loved Mom,
but she just didn't understand</i>

164
00:09:57,874 --> 00:09:59,373
- <i>how to hunt squirrels.</i>
- Good.

165
00:10:00,806 --> 00:10:02,704
Nice dog.

166
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:05,406
Sorry. Didn't mean
to startle you.

167
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,572
I'm Gunter Beckenbauer.

168
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,274
Those are
my houses there.

169
00:10:12,373 --> 00:10:13,905
What do you want,
Mr. Beckenbauer?

170
00:10:13,907 --> 00:10:16,570
Oh, please,
call me "Gunter."

171
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:18,337
<i>I knew that smell.</i>

172
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:20,437
- <i>And I knew this wasn't good.</i>
- Look.

173
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:22,170
I know it's your son
who's been calling

174
00:10:22,172 --> 00:10:24,004
the county building authority
about the stupid cats,

175
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:26,071
which I got rid of.

176
00:10:26,073 --> 00:10:27,671
I've lost
the whole summer now,

177
00:10:27,673 --> 00:10:29,203
so, could you please
just ask him to back off?

178
00:10:29,205 --> 00:10:31,505
My son isn't gonna back off,
Mr. Beckenbauer,

179
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,705
because there are still cats
living there.

180
00:10:33,707 --> 00:10:35,205
Animal Control
says there's not.

181
00:10:35,207 --> 00:10:37,440
Animal Control is lying,
and so are you.

182
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:42,038
What kind of dog
is that? Pit bull?

183
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,874
We don't know. We found her living
with the cats you say aren't there.

184
00:10:47,073 --> 00:10:49,470
What I'm trying to say, lady,

185
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:52,673
is that you and your boy do
not want to go to war with me.

186
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,805
War? What do you
know about war?

187
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:01,371
Okay.

188
00:11:01,373 --> 00:11:03,037
But let the record
show that I tried

189
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,405
to settle this friendly,
and you're the one pushing it.

190
00:11:05,407 --> 00:11:09,704
No, the record shows that you came
here and said we were going to war.

191
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,904
Come on, Bella, relax.

192
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:18,441
Relax.
Let's go do your business.

193
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:24,103
What is it? Cold, wet.

194
00:11:24,105 --> 00:11:25,505
Ice cream!

195
00:11:25,507 --> 00:11:27,738
- Ice cream is falling from the sky!
- Bella.

196
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,170
It's snow.

197
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:34,036
It's just snow.
Now, do your business.

198
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,538
What? What?

199
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,774
Go on, go on.

200
00:11:58,706 --> 00:12:00,138
Come on, go on. Go on.

201
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,003
Go on.

202
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:12,638
Go on. Yeah.

203
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,605
- <i>I loved Snow Do Your Business.</i>
- Go on.

204
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:25,171
- Yay! Lucas is home!
- Hello.

205
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:26,604
Hi. Hey.

206
00:12:26,606 --> 00:12:28,371
<i>When Lucas came home,</i>

207
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:32,338
- <i>I felt joy in my whole body.</i>
- Hello. Hello.

208
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,672
- What's that?
- I don't know.

209
00:12:34,674 --> 00:12:36,307
It was taped to the door.

210
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:42,438
Oh, no.

211
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,238
It's the landlord.

212
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,338
He's coming tomorrow
to check the faucet.

213
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,004
But I have therapy
and you have to work.

214
00:12:49,006 --> 00:12:51,338
What will we do with Bella?

215
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,207
She can't be in the house
when he's here.

216
00:12:56,973 --> 00:12:58,907
Just stick to the plan.

217
00:13:00,673 --> 00:13:03,138
If they see her,
you're gonna get fired.

218
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,173
Don't worry.

219
00:13:15,473 --> 00:13:17,407
All clear. Hurry up.

220
00:13:20,706 --> 00:13:23,373
<i>That day,
I got to do Go to Work.</i>

221
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:37,404
Bella. Okay,
stay here. Stay.

222
00:13:37,406 --> 00:13:39,770
<i>I didn't like Stay.</i>

223
00:13:39,772 --> 00:13:41,906
No barks. Understand?

224
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,439
I'll come check on you
in a little while.

225
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:49,371
You can't get caught, okay, Bella?

226
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:51,737
Wait, hold on.
Where are you going?

227
00:13:51,739 --> 00:13:53,174
No barks.

228
00:13:57,173 --> 00:13:59,670
I definitely do not
get this game.

229
00:14:05,674 --> 00:14:07,407
Lucas?

230
00:14:13,705 --> 00:14:15,870
PT reports
he's not responding,

231
00:14:15,872 --> 00:14:18,237
and recommends going
to twice a day.

232
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:20,869
Okay, well, we can try, but if he...

233
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:24,704
Um, Dr. Gann,

234
00:14:24,706 --> 00:14:26,938
would you excuse me?

235
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,907
- Hey, Valerie, I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

236
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:39,104
Yes, I was barking,
but it worked.

237
00:14:39,106 --> 00:14:40,537
- Here you are.
- No.

238
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:41,705
Is that the game?

239
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:43,870
Bella?

240
00:14:43,872 --> 00:14:46,005
- Oh, my gosh, she's gotten so big.
- Olivia!

241
00:14:46,007 --> 00:14:48,038
- Hi.
- Do you know

242
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,037
anybody here who could watch her,
just for an hour or so, until my break?

243
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,540
Just an hour.

244
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:57,170
Okay, fine, but you know
you only ever talk to me

245
00:14:57,172 --> 00:14:58,839
when you have
animal issues, right?

246
00:15:01,407 --> 00:15:03,838
Am I interrupting something?

247
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,172
Now, this could not possibly be a
dog in the VA against all the regs.

248
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,470
I know, Teo. We can't
leave Bella home today.

249
00:15:10,472 --> 00:15:12,970
If the landlord catches us with a
dog, we could get evicted.

250
00:15:12,972 --> 00:15:14,305
Now, I understand.

251
00:15:14,307 --> 00:15:16,304
The game is Crowd
in a Small Room.

252
00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:17,740
Bella, huh?

253
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:20,837
You know what?

254
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:23,370
I've got this.

255
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:26,203
Everybody? Everybody?

256
00:15:26,205 --> 00:15:28,871
Thought I'd bring a special
guest to today's meeting.

257
00:15:28,873 --> 00:15:30,736
I'd like you to
meet the lovely Bella.

258
00:15:30,738 --> 00:15:32,571
- Hi, Bella.
- Great. That's great.

259
00:15:32,573 --> 00:15:34,438
- Look at that.
- How long you been sober?

260
00:15:35,572 --> 00:15:37,404
That long, huh?

261
00:15:37,406 --> 00:15:39,307
It was a good idea, man.

262
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:42,903
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

263
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:44,603
- It'll only happen once in a while.
- Yeah.

264
00:15:44,605 --> 00:15:46,604
<i>After that,
I really liked Go to Work.</i>

265
00:15:46,606 --> 00:15:48,771
- Looks like she likes being here.
- I think she does, too.

266
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:50,371
I just have no motivation.

267
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:53,204
Like, I know it would be
good for me, but...

268
00:15:53,206 --> 00:15:55,738
<i>I could always feel
Mom's sadness going away</i>

269
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,904
<i>when I comforted her,
like Mother Cat comforted me.</i>

270
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:02,871
Mack, what's it
been like with you?

271
00:16:02,873 --> 00:16:05,074
It's, uh... It's like...

272
00:16:06,406 --> 00:16:09,170
It's, like,
pain all the time.

273
00:16:09,172 --> 00:16:10,670
- <i>But she wasn't the only one...</i>
- Every morning.

274
00:16:10,672 --> 00:16:12,371
<i>...who needed me.</i>

275
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:14,606
<i>Mack was the most sad.</i>

276
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:20,637
That's real. That's real talk.

277
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,404
You know? Hey, girl.

278
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:24,873
I'm gonna
bring her again tomorrow.

279
00:16:28,206 --> 00:16:29,670
Look who's here!

280
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,205
<i>Now, I have
lots of new friends.</i>

281
00:16:34,207 --> 00:16:37,271
- Come on, Bella.
- Look at that.

282
00:16:37,273 --> 00:16:40,769
<i>Drew took me on rides
in his small car.</i>

283
00:16:40,771 --> 00:16:42,536
Bella, open.

284
00:16:42,538 --> 00:16:45,572
<i>Steve had
really delicious spoons.</i>

285
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,204
<i>Some of my friends
had tags, just like me.</i>

286
00:16:53,407 --> 00:16:54,474
Aw, good girl.

287
00:16:55,906 --> 00:16:57,337
Bella!

288
00:16:57,339 --> 00:16:58,504
Bella, get down.

289
00:16:58,506 --> 00:17:00,404
We're doing laundry. Down.

290
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:02,906
<i>I really liked
Doing Laundry.</i>

291
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,305
<i>And everyone played
a game called Dr. Gann.</i>

292
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:09,570
Doctor! Ha!

293
00:17:09,572 --> 00:17:11,536
- Dr. Gann.
- Hey, let's go.

294
00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:12,837
- Hey, Dr. Gann.
- Good morning. How are you?

295
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,171
Dr. Gann.
In you go. In you go!

296
00:17:16,173 --> 00:17:18,037
Were
you going in, or...

297
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,838
- Appreciate it. Thank you.
- Your turn.

298
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,405
- Oh, shoot.
- Okay, no...

299
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:24,537
- Take your time. Okay.
- Thank you.

300
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:26,203
All right. Good morning.

301
00:17:26,205 --> 00:17:27,570
- Good morning, Doc.
- Good morning, everyone.

302
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:28,770
- Morning, Dr. Gann.
- Good morning, Doc.

303
00:17:28,772 --> 00:17:29,639
- Morning.
- What's up, Doc?

304
00:17:31,772 --> 00:17:32,873
Okay.

305
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,070
Everything all right?

306
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,205
Bye, Doc.

307
00:17:56,272 --> 00:17:58,804
- Good girl.
- What a good girl.

308
00:17:58,806 --> 00:18:00,504
Let's do that again!

309
00:18:00,506 --> 00:18:02,207
- So smart.
- Good girl.

310
00:18:04,906 --> 00:18:06,440
I had fun last night.

311
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:10,504
Me, too.

312
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,971
<i>Now, whenever Lucas and I
went looking for that squirrel,</i>

313
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:14,570
- <i>Olivia came, too.</i>
- Next time, all right?

314
00:18:14,572 --> 00:18:16,039
So, there's gonna be
a next time? Got it.

315
00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:23,505
All right, let's go.

316
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,536
- Take Bella?
- Yeah.

317
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,871
- I'm gonna call the rescue.
- Yeah.

318
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:28,907
Hey!

319
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:32,370
Wait! Stop!

320
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:34,003
What the hell you doing?

321
00:18:34,005 --> 00:18:36,203
There are still cats living there.
You can't do this.

322
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:37,940
- We've got a permit.
- That doesn't matter.

323
00:18:42,572 --> 00:18:45,937
- You kidding me?
- Hey!

324
00:18:45,939 --> 00:18:48,271
- I have had enough of you, you crazy...
- They're on it.

325
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:51,003
Can I talk to you for a minute?

326
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,537
Why you screwing
with my life?

327
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:54,070
How did you
even get a permit?

328
00:18:55,405 --> 00:18:58,071
Property's certified.
No cats.

329
00:18:58,073 --> 00:19:00,537
- Hey.
- I'm live-streaming, cat killer.

330
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,971
There are no cats!

331
00:19:06,306 --> 00:19:07,637
Mother Cat!

332
00:19:09,206 --> 00:19:10,370
Where are you going?

333
00:19:10,372 --> 00:19:12,737
No cats?

334
00:19:12,739 --> 00:19:14,836
The rescue organization that I work
with just called the Building Commission

335
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:15,903
to have your permit yanked.

336
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,303
Like they move that fast.

337
00:19:17,305 --> 00:19:19,237
They do when
our board member calls.

338
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:20,538
She's a county commissioner.

339
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,837
Hey, Gunter.

340
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,837
Yeah.

341
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,039
It's about your permit.

342
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:32,003
Who on earth
could that be?

343
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,807
I don't know.
I'll get it.

344
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,570
Excuse me.

345
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:42,537
There's been a complaint that you
may be harboring a dangerous animal.

346
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:44,570
A complaint? From who?

347
00:19:44,572 --> 00:19:48,003
As you may know, pit bulls are
illegal in the City of Denver.

348
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:51,171
As long as it's on your
property, we can't touch it.

349
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:53,903
- I remember him.
- I am informing you

350
00:19:53,905 --> 00:19:57,669
that if that dog gets
picked up on the street,

351
00:19:57,671 --> 00:19:58,972
it will be impounded.

352
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:02,039
Have a nice night.

353
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,070
Okay, Bella,
this is very important.

354
00:20:10,072 --> 00:20:12,004
We're gonna try this again.

355
00:20:12,006 --> 00:20:14,174
Okay. You ready?

356
00:20:14,805 --> 00:20:15,840
And...

357
00:20:17,706 --> 00:20:18,872
Go home.

358
00:20:20,873 --> 00:20:21,907
That's it, Bella.

359
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:23,940
Go home.

360
00:20:24,906 --> 00:20:26,040
Yep.

361
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,070
Best game ever!

362
00:20:36,072 --> 00:20:40,671
<i>Doing Go Home meant I should
put my head right here.</i>

363
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,437
Yes! You did it!

364
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:45,502
You did Go Home.
Well done.

365
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:48,770
- That was impressive.
- Good job, Bella.

366
00:20:48,772 --> 00:20:50,903
- Good girl.
- Wow.

367
00:20:50,905 --> 00:20:53,369
So, now,
if we take Bella off the property

368
00:20:53,371 --> 00:20:57,937
and Animal Control tries to take
her, we just say, "Go home."

369
00:20:57,939 --> 00:21:00,572
<i>I loved making Lucas happy.</i>

370
00:21:07,406 --> 00:21:09,370
That squirrel!

371
00:21:09,372 --> 00:21:10,907
<i>I had to have that squirrel.</i>

372
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,907
Squirrel, squirrel, squirrel!

373
00:21:20,672 --> 00:21:21,839
Bella?

374
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,039
Bella!

375
00:21:25,072 --> 00:21:26,272
Bella!

376
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,807
Bella!

377
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,238
Bella, I've been looking
all over for you.

378
00:21:51,007 --> 00:21:53,204
Bad dog.

379
00:21:53,206 --> 00:21:57,203
Bella, you can never,
ever do that again.

380
00:21:57,205 --> 00:21:59,639
I don't care about the window,
but you cannot run away.

381
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:05,202
Hold it right there, pal.

382
00:22:05,204 --> 00:22:07,171
I'm impounding
that animal.

383
00:22:07,173 --> 00:22:10,071
- No, you are not.
- Yes, I am, and that's my backup.

384
00:22:10,073 --> 00:22:13,038
This is a pit bull.
And this is a legal impoundment.

385
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,174
If he resists,
you arrest him.

386
00:22:16,372 --> 00:22:18,004
Go home, Bella.

387
00:22:18,006 --> 00:22:19,638
Bella, go home.

388
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,107
- Go home, Bella.
- <i>But you need me.</i>

389
00:22:23,072 --> 00:22:24,636
Bella.

390
00:22:24,638 --> 00:22:26,970
Bella, please, go home.

391
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:28,670
Bella, please.
Go home, Bella.

392
00:22:28,672 --> 00:22:30,004
That's right.

393
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:31,904
- Easy does it.
- Bella, go home.

394
00:22:31,906 --> 00:22:33,371
Easy. There we go.

395
00:22:33,373 --> 00:22:35,170
Don't do that.

396
00:22:35,172 --> 00:22:37,304
- Sir.
- Come on.

397
00:22:37,306 --> 00:22:40,004
Sir, let go, now.

398
00:22:40,006 --> 00:22:41,406
You need to let him
have the dog.

399
00:22:43,106 --> 00:22:44,873
Not with that on her.

400
00:22:49,372 --> 00:22:51,503
Let go.

401
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:53,973
Chuck, let him do it.

402
00:22:59,272 --> 00:23:00,404
It's okay, Bella.

403
00:23:00,406 --> 00:23:02,537
It's okay. It's okay.
I got you.

404
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:05,270
Follow me.

405
00:23:05,272 --> 00:23:08,106
It's okay. I got you,
baby. It's okay.

406
00:23:10,371 --> 00:23:12,904
It's okay.

407
00:23:12,906 --> 00:23:15,304
Bella, I screwed up.

408
00:23:15,306 --> 00:23:16,672
I'm so sorry.

409
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,636
- All right.
- <i>All of a sudden,</i>

410
00:23:24,638 --> 00:23:26,236
- <i>I smelled so many other dogs.</i>
- You're okay. It's all right.

411
00:23:36,573 --> 00:23:39,236
I will come get you,
Bella. Understand?

412
00:23:39,238 --> 00:23:42,370
I'm sorry I didn't do
Go Home, Lucas.

413
00:23:42,372 --> 00:23:44,769
- I will not let them hurt you.
- Okay, that's enough.

414
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:46,272
Step away, please.

415
00:23:47,672 --> 00:23:49,104
Step away.

416
00:23:49,106 --> 00:23:51,405
Please.

417
00:24:05,538 --> 00:24:07,238
Lucas?

418
00:24:22,338 --> 00:24:25,539
<i>It was so loud,
and all the dogs were so sad.</i>

419
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:29,405
Okay.

420
00:24:30,905 --> 00:24:33,236
In you go.

421
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:36,072
<i>I thought if I did Good Dog,
they'd let me go back to Lucas.</i>

422
00:24:40,405 --> 00:24:41,705
<i>I did Sit.</i>

423
00:24:43,506 --> 00:24:45,238
<i>I did Sit some more.</i>

424
00:24:46,706 --> 00:24:48,106
<i>I did No Barks.</i>

425
00:24:50,173 --> 00:24:52,073
<i>I did Lots of Barks.</i>

426
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:57,806
<i>I really needed
my Lucas blanket.</i>

427
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,139
<i>I should have done Go Home.</i>

428
00:25:11,206 --> 00:25:12,239
Come on.

429
00:25:13,372 --> 00:25:15,303
Hello.

430
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,136
Hang on.

431
00:25:17,138 --> 00:25:18,871
Aw, you don't seem like

432
00:25:18,873 --> 00:25:21,570
such a dangerous animal to
me, sweet girl, hmm?

433
00:25:21,572 --> 00:25:23,606
Come on. Come on.

434
00:25:27,405 --> 00:25:29,470
- Hey!
- Lucas!

435
00:25:29,472 --> 00:25:31,838
- Hi. Hi.
- I'm ready to do Go Home.

436
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,337
Hey. See, I'm here.

437
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:34,904
- I'm here.
- Well, there's question one.

438
00:25:34,906 --> 00:25:36,470
She's obviously your dog.

439
00:25:36,472 --> 00:25:39,170
Good girl. I know.
I know. Good girl.

440
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:41,536
All right. There you go.

441
00:25:41,538 --> 00:25:43,370
So, you've paid the fine.

442
00:25:43,372 --> 00:25:46,069
I just need to give you
the discharge information.

443
00:25:46,071 --> 00:25:49,536
In Denver, all that's required for
a dog to be classified as a pit bull

444
00:25:49,538 --> 00:25:53,870
is for three Animal Control
officers to certify that it is.

445
00:25:53,872 --> 00:25:56,237
And Bella has been
certified pit bull.

446
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:58,237
What does
"certified pit" mean?

447
00:25:58,239 --> 00:26:00,305
It means if they pick her up
again, she'll be euthanized.

448
00:26:02,273 --> 00:26:04,837
- What?
- That's the law.

449
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:08,036
Pit bull's a pretty loose description.
It's like saying "hound dog."

450
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:11,536
So, the City Council essentially voted
that a dog can be banned from the city

451
00:26:11,538 --> 00:26:12,838
because of how it looks.

452
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,671
That's basically
racism for dogs.

453
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,504
I know. It's stupid.

454
00:26:16,506 --> 00:26:19,070
I mean, Bella is the most
gentle dog in the world.

455
00:26:19,072 --> 00:26:21,203
You should see her at the
hospital with the veterans.

456
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,837
I mean, they love her.

457
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:24,569
What about if we move?

458
00:26:24,571 --> 00:26:27,035
Like, Golden or somewhere
out of the city limits?

459
00:26:27,037 --> 00:26:28,969
That works.

460
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:30,303
Meanwhile, do you have someone
who can look after her?

461
00:26:30,305 --> 00:26:31,838
My aunt and uncle,
they live in Farmington.

462
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,002
- Maybe they could help us.
- New Mexico?

463
00:26:34,004 --> 00:26:35,572
It's like 400 miles.

464
00:26:37,404 --> 00:26:41,706
I'm really ready to do
Go Home now.

465
00:26:44,572 --> 00:26:48,437
All right, here we go.
Got your dinosaur.

466
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:49,640
What else do we have?

467
00:26:55,606 --> 00:26:57,402
It's so good
of you to do this.

468
00:26:57,404 --> 00:26:59,103
We're just happy to help.

469
00:26:59,105 --> 00:27:00,572
Olivia's such a sweetheart.

470
00:27:01,405 --> 00:27:03,037
Well, this is it.

471
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,440
I'll be in the car.

472
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:09,570
Why is everyone so sad?

473
00:27:09,572 --> 00:27:11,473
We're all home, now.

474
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,906
Bella, I'm so sorry.

475
00:27:17,573 --> 00:27:19,637
See you soon.

476
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:22,471
Okay, I'll sneak out
the back window.

477
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:25,939
At least there's
no screen on that one.

478
00:27:29,139 --> 00:27:30,273
Hey.

479
00:27:32,138 --> 00:27:34,572
Here, I got ya, I got ya.

480
00:27:36,206 --> 00:27:37,736
Hello.

481
00:27:37,738 --> 00:27:40,002
Stop.

482
00:27:40,004 --> 00:27:44,836
Backup can't possibly get here
fast enough to help you.

483
00:27:44,838 --> 00:27:48,903
We understand the little game
that you're playing here.

484
00:27:48,905 --> 00:27:50,537
It's Gunter, isn't it?

485
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:52,537
You work for him?

486
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:54,836
Maybe you're just buddies.

487
00:27:54,838 --> 00:27:56,603
Now, you're gonna
let my son

488
00:27:56,605 --> 00:27:59,770
walk to that car
to say goodbye to his dog

489
00:27:59,772 --> 00:28:02,073
without any
interference from you.

490
00:28:03,105 --> 00:28:04,139
Copy?

491
00:28:05,506 --> 00:28:06,540
Copy.

492
00:28:11,872 --> 00:28:14,706
Go on, Bella.
That's it.

493
00:28:16,371 --> 00:28:17,639
Hey.

494
00:28:21,673 --> 00:28:24,303
You're such
a good girl, Bella.

495
00:28:24,305 --> 00:28:29,002
I know you won't understand,
but I'm not abandoning you.

496
00:28:29,004 --> 00:28:31,038
I just have to send you
somewhere safe.

497
00:28:31,904 --> 00:28:34,070
Where are we going?

498
00:28:34,072 --> 00:28:37,003
Why can't I ride
in the front with you?

499
00:28:37,005 --> 00:28:38,836
Here.

500
00:28:38,838 --> 00:28:40,370
You gotta have your blanket.

501
00:28:40,372 --> 00:28:42,870
Why did he bring
my Lucas blanket?

502
00:28:42,872 --> 00:28:44,404
It should be on the bed.

503
00:28:44,406 --> 00:28:48,970
I promise, very soon,
you'll get to go home.

504
00:28:59,372 --> 00:29:03,139
Lucas said, "Go home,"
but then he shut the door.

505
00:29:12,871 --> 00:29:14,536
<i>I need Lucas!</i>

506
00:29:14,538 --> 00:29:17,768
Please! No!

507
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:42,203
<i>His scent was fading.</i>

508
00:29:42,205 --> 00:29:45,673
<i>I was getting farther
and farther away.</i>

509
00:29:55,673 --> 00:29:58,069
<i>I smelled my Lucas blanket
to feel better,</i>

510
00:29:58,071 --> 00:30:00,872
<i>but it wasn't Lucas.</i>

511
00:30:26,638 --> 00:30:27,702
Sit.

512
00:30:30,572 --> 00:30:32,206
Bella,
come here.

513
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:35,636
Yes.

514
00:30:35,638 --> 00:30:37,738
Oh, you're so pretty.
Yes, you are.

515
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:44,237
<i>These people were nice.</i>

516
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:48,402
<i>They took care of me,
but they weren't my family.</i>

517
00:30:48,404 --> 00:30:49,836
<i>This wasn't home.</i>

518
00:30:53,172 --> 00:30:54,902
Hello?

519
00:30:54,904 --> 00:30:57,437
Hey, how is everything?

520
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:00,603
Oh, she's fine. Yeah. Really?

521
00:31:00,605 --> 00:31:03,771
Okay. All right.
See you tomorrow, then.

522
00:31:06,671 --> 00:31:09,035
Guess what?

523
00:31:09,037 --> 00:31:11,404
They found
a nice place in Golden,

524
00:31:11,406 --> 00:31:14,702
and they're coming
to get you tomorrow.

525
00:31:14,704 --> 00:31:17,837
I bet you're ready to go home.
You're a good dog, Bella.

526
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:19,570
<i>Jose said, "Go home."</i>

527
00:31:19,572 --> 00:31:20,735
- You're a good dog.
- <i>But how?</i>

528
00:31:20,737 --> 00:31:21,871
Good night.

529
00:31:23,272 --> 00:31:25,205
<i>That feeling
came again.</i>

530
00:31:26,837 --> 00:31:29,072
<i>I was supposed
to be with Lucas.</i>

531
00:31:32,472 --> 00:31:36,006
<i>I had to find a way
to get to him.</i>

532
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,369
<i>I didn't know
what that loud thing was,</i>

533
00:31:48,371 --> 00:31:51,739
<i>but Jose sure liked to take it
for walks around the yard.</i>

534
00:31:57,638 --> 00:32:00,638
<i>But I do remember that
from Snow Do Your Business.</i>

535
00:32:09,071 --> 00:32:10,406
Wait.

536
00:32:21,405 --> 00:32:22,405
Yes!

537
00:32:30,739 --> 00:32:32,202
I'm doing it!

538
00:32:32,204 --> 00:32:34,871
I'm doing Go Home!

539
00:33:16,105 --> 00:33:20,239
<i>I could tell that Go Home
was very far away.</i>

540
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:31,306
<i>But I knew that I was going
in the right direction.</i>

541
00:33:38,872 --> 00:33:42,870
<i>The feeling now was a pull,
like I was on a leash</i>

542
00:33:42,872 --> 00:33:46,535
<i>and being told
how to do Go Home.</i>

543
00:33:46,537 --> 00:33:51,338
<i>And if I kept going,
I knew I would see Lucas again.</i>

544
00:34:08,405 --> 00:34:12,837
<i>By that first night,
I was so tired.</i>

545
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:15,535
<i>And there were so many
strange smells.</i>

546
00:34:23,171 --> 00:34:24,138
What's that?

547
00:34:27,605 --> 00:34:30,538
It looks like a cat,
but it smells like a dog.

548
00:34:35,972 --> 00:34:38,871
I hope it doesn't come back.

549
00:34:46,738 --> 00:34:48,469
<i>It was breakfast time,</i>

550
00:34:48,471 --> 00:34:51,005
<i>but I couldn't find
a bowl of food anywhere.</i>

551
00:34:53,671 --> 00:34:55,703
It's not in a bowl,

552
00:34:55,705 --> 00:34:56,872
but I'll take it.

553
00:34:59,538 --> 00:35:01,772
This breakfast is really fast!

554
00:35:08,705 --> 00:35:10,739
I need breakfast!

555
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:18,373
This breakfast was harder
to hunt than that squirrel.

556
00:35:26,904 --> 00:35:30,705
<i>I was hungrier
than I'd ever been.</i>

557
00:35:32,771 --> 00:35:34,401
People.

558
00:35:34,403 --> 00:35:36,472
There are people down there.

559
00:35:56,004 --> 00:35:57,272
A pack.

560
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:02,669
Maybe I shouldn't
bother them.

561
00:36:02,671 --> 00:36:04,038
But I'm so hungry.

562
00:36:08,404 --> 00:36:11,602
One Tooth is big.

563
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:15,138
To be polite, I'll carefully sniff
where the other dogs have marked.

564
00:36:23,071 --> 00:36:24,204
What?

565
00:36:24,206 --> 00:36:26,739
Oh, Crazy Hair is in charge.

566
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:28,871
Thanks.

567
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,503
<i>This was a great pack.</i>

568
00:36:32,505 --> 00:36:34,602
<i>They knew just where to go
to get the best chicken.</i>

569
00:36:34,604 --> 00:36:36,805
Hey. There you are.

570
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:40,837
Yeah, today's
special. Chicken.

571
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:42,137
You like that. You like...

572
00:36:42,139 --> 00:36:43,537
I love
this chicken guy.

573
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:46,303
Okay, very good.
That's it. That's it.

574
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:48,272
You can go now, okay? Go.

575
00:36:52,804 --> 00:36:55,003
Coming.

576
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:57,802
<i>One Tooth was a brave hunter,</i>

577
00:36:57,804 --> 00:37:00,837
<i>who wasn't afraid of anything.</i>

578
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:03,105
<i>It was exciting
to learn to hunt from him.</i>

579
00:37:06,705 --> 00:37:08,536
- <i>This pack was so much fun.</i>
- Hello.

580
00:37:08,538 --> 00:37:10,603
Hi, sweethearts.

581
00:37:10,605 --> 00:37:12,769
Oh, and who are you?
Are you new?

582
00:37:12,771 --> 00:37:15,070
There you go,
sweethearts. Yeah.

583
00:37:15,072 --> 00:37:18,335
Please go home now.
Go on home now. Go on home.

584
00:37:18,337 --> 00:37:20,269
How did she know
I was doing Go Home?

585
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,272
Go home!

586
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:29,170
- <i>It was a wonderful day.</i>
- Good boy, Sarge.

587
00:37:29,172 --> 00:37:31,003
But where's One Tooth going?

588
00:37:31,005 --> 00:37:32,105
All right, in you go. Come on.

589
00:37:40,404 --> 00:37:41,906
And Shaggy Butt, too?

590
00:37:44,005 --> 00:37:47,439
Guess that just leaves
you and me, Crazy Hair.

591
00:37:48,972 --> 00:37:50,836
Oh, wait.

592
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:52,938
Everyone in this pack
has their own people.

593
00:37:57,304 --> 00:38:01,302
<i>Crazy Hair wanted me to go with
him, to be part of his family.</i>

594
00:38:01,304 --> 00:38:04,538
<i>It seemed nice in there,
with lots of good smells.</i>

595
00:38:06,704 --> 00:38:09,005
<i>I could be happy here.</i>

596
00:38:10,238 --> 00:38:11,672
<i>But they didn't need me.</i>

597
00:38:14,504 --> 00:38:17,069
<i>Mom needed me.</i>

598
00:38:17,071 --> 00:38:19,503
<i>Lucas needed me.</i>

599
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:22,268
<i>And I needed them.</i>

600
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:28,235
Lucy! There you are.

601
00:38:28,237 --> 00:38:31,871
<i>So, I had to keep
doing Go Home.</i>

602
00:38:52,704 --> 00:38:56,236
<i>Now, I knew that to hunt I needed
to go where there were people</i>

603
00:38:56,238 --> 00:38:59,905
<i>and do what
One Tooth taught me.</i>

604
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:32,072
<i>I smelled blood.</i>

605
00:39:34,738 --> 00:39:38,102
<i>It was the largest animal
I had ever seen.</i>

606
00:39:38,104 --> 00:39:40,936
<i>And something very bad
had happened to her.</i>

607
00:39:40,938 --> 00:39:43,038
Come on!
Whoo! Through here.

608
00:39:44,106 --> 00:39:45,803
I see it. Go.

609
00:39:45,805 --> 00:39:47,368
Thing's gotta be
worth a thousand bucks.

610
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:49,201
Oh, at least. Beautiful.

611
00:39:49,203 --> 00:39:50,736
What do you figure?
About 125 pounds?

612
00:39:50,738 --> 00:39:52,502
Oh, yeah.

613
00:39:52,504 --> 00:39:53,538
- Hey, let's get a selfie.
- Yeah, you bet.

614
00:40:01,705 --> 00:40:03,003
Okay, ready?

615
00:40:03,005 --> 00:40:05,170
- Yeah.
- Here.

616
00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:08,202
Wow. She's beautiful.

617
00:40:08,204 --> 00:40:10,070
Yeah,
that one's going up on the wall.

618
00:40:10,072 --> 00:40:11,168
Yeah.

619
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,969
What is that?

620
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:15,903
<i>It kind of looks
like a cat.</i>

621
00:40:15,905 --> 00:40:19,539
<i>I hoped the cat would leave with me
and not get caught by those bad men.</i>

622
00:40:22,071 --> 00:40:25,737
<i>That cat didn't smell
like any cat I ever knew.</i>

623
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:27,906
<i>Was it following me?</i>

624
00:40:30,571 --> 00:40:32,738
<i>Yep, it was following me.</i>

625
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:41,703
<i>And suddenly, I realized
it wasn't a full-grown cat.</i>

626
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:44,069
<i>It was still just a kitten.</i>

627
00:40:44,071 --> 00:40:46,502
<i>A really big kitten.</i>

628
00:40:46,504 --> 00:40:49,505
Come on,
Big Kitten. This way.

629
00:41:01,538 --> 00:41:04,772
<i>That big animal must have
been this kitten's mother.</i>

630
00:41:07,304 --> 00:41:09,336
<i>Big Kitten made me
think of Mother Dog</i>

631
00:41:09,338 --> 00:41:12,372
<i>and how sad I was
when she was taken away.</i>

632
00:41:15,204 --> 00:41:18,172
<i>She needed someone
to take care of her.</i>

633
00:41:42,006 --> 00:41:44,939
<i>Big Kitten's mother
couldn't feed her anymore,</i>

634
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:47,872
<i>so, I did.</i>

635
00:41:59,671 --> 00:42:03,038
<i>I was Big Kitten's
Mother Cat now.</i>

636
00:42:14,036 --> 00:42:16,869
<i>Big Kitten needed to eat,
and so did I.</i>

637
00:42:16,871 --> 00:42:19,301
<i>So, I did what
any mother would do.</i>

638
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:20,505
<i>I went hunting.</i>

639
00:42:26,604 --> 00:42:28,837
Sorry, baby!

640
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,836
Hey! Hey! Drop it!

641
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:49,736
Oh!

642
00:43:14,871 --> 00:43:18,604
<i>Many nights, Big Kitten
would wander off on her own.</i>

643
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:30,203
<i>I would sleep
and dream of home.</i>

644
00:43:30,205 --> 00:43:33,272
You ready for your
tiny piece of cheese?

645
00:43:35,437 --> 00:43:38,604
Here you go. Good girl.

646
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:42,037
<i>You're such a good dog, Bella.</i>

647
00:43:51,104 --> 00:43:54,436
<i>As time passed
and Big Kitten got bigger,</i>

648
00:43:54,438 --> 00:44:00,702
<i>she still didn't seem to
understand how to do Go Home.</i>

649
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:02,502
<i>So, when she tried
to take me away from it,</i>

650
00:44:02,504 --> 00:44:04,571
<i>I would always
have to bring her back.</i>

651
00:44:09,037 --> 00:44:13,104
<i>Whenever Big Kitten went out at
night, someone gave her food.</i>

652
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:18,669
<i>Cats love fish,</i>

653
00:44:18,671 --> 00:44:20,605
<i>but I wish someone
would give her chicken.</i>

654
00:44:29,738 --> 00:44:32,105
<i>We kept each other warm.</i>

655
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,870
<i>We were family now.</i>

656
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:50,901
<i>I had been smelling
something all morning.</i>

657
00:44:52,105 --> 00:44:55,438
<i>Something like dog.</i>

658
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:01,469
<i>First, I heard them.</i>

659
00:45:05,204 --> 00:45:07,371
<i>Then I saw them.</i>

660
00:45:11,305 --> 00:45:13,402
<i>Their eyes were cold.</i>

661
00:45:18,205 --> 00:45:19,503
<i>They were hunting us.</i>

662
00:45:25,338 --> 00:45:27,905
<i>And I had
to protect Big Kitten.</i>

663
00:46:09,705 --> 00:46:12,501
Hey! Get out!
Get out of here!

664
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:13,636
Scram! Get out!

665
00:46:19,637 --> 00:46:21,401
Hey, check it out.

666
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:24,469
- Is that a bobcat?
- No, no, it's a cougar.

667
00:46:24,471 --> 00:46:25,605
It's a young cougar.

668
00:46:27,903 --> 00:46:29,136
<i>Big Kitten
was afraid of the men.</i>

669
00:46:29,138 --> 00:46:31,036
Whoa.
That's really fast.

670
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,268
<i>But I decided to see
if they would give us food.</i>

671
00:46:34,904 --> 00:46:36,934
Pretty scared to me.

672
00:46:36,936 --> 00:46:38,703
I've never seen a cougar
in the wild before.

673
00:46:38,705 --> 00:46:41,669
I mean, this thing was huge.
It was like 10 feet long.

674
00:46:41,671 --> 00:46:43,269
- Easy, 12.
- Yeah.

675
00:46:43,271 --> 00:46:47,038
Hey. Let's see if your name
is on your tag, huh?

676
00:46:48,003 --> 00:46:48,970
Who's a good girl?

677
00:46:51,371 --> 00:46:54,002
- She's a cutie.
- She is.

678
00:46:54,004 --> 00:46:55,868
Want some ham?

679
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:57,702
There's your ham. There you go.
Sit. Oh, good girl.

680
00:46:57,704 --> 00:46:59,269
Her name is Bella.

681
00:46:59,271 --> 00:47:01,001
Give me a paw. Good girl.
There you go.

682
00:47:01,003 --> 00:47:03,069
And there's a telephone number.
"Lucas Ray."

683
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:04,570
Lucas?

684
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,738
I'm gonna call the guy.

685
00:47:09,071 --> 00:47:10,902
Hey, guys, I think there's
something moving out there.

686
00:47:10,904 --> 00:47:12,669
Okay, it's going
to voice mail.

687
00:47:12,671 --> 00:47:14,702
<i>Hi.
You've reached Lucas Ray...</i>

688
00:47:14,704 --> 00:47:16,502
- That's him!
- <i>Assistant case manager</i>

689
00:47:16,504 --> 00:47:18,702
<i>at McLaren VA Hospital.
Please leave a message.</i>

690
00:47:18,704 --> 00:47:20,968
<i>If you're calling
about my lost dog Bella...</i>

691
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:23,336
Man, she's kind
of freaking out.

692
00:47:23,338 --> 00:47:27,002
<i>Please, leave your number
or call Olivia at 612-589-1743...</i>

693
00:47:27,004 --> 00:47:28,005
What?

694
00:47:31,638 --> 00:47:33,536
- Cougar! Get in the truck!
- Oh, God.

695
00:47:33,538 --> 00:47:35,101
I'm here, Lucas.

696
00:47:35,103 --> 00:47:36,538
I'm here. I'm here.

697
00:48:12,571 --> 00:48:14,605
It's Snow Do Your Business!

698
00:49:43,437 --> 00:49:45,737
She acted
like that was easy.

699
00:50:36,837 --> 00:50:38,205
A dog!

700
00:50:44,704 --> 00:50:46,905
It's been so long
since I played with a dog.

701
00:50:53,703 --> 00:50:55,735
Dutch, what are
you barking at?

702
00:50:55,737 --> 00:50:56,738
Hey.

703
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:02,138
- Be quiet. Come on!
- Shut up!

704
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:08,138
Dutch!

705
00:51:08,836 --> 00:51:09,937
You stupid mutt!

706
00:51:11,137 --> 00:51:12,369
Dutch!

707
00:51:16,304 --> 00:51:17,272
Get out of there!

708
00:51:26,737 --> 00:51:27,770
Dutch!

709
00:52:16,638 --> 00:52:19,403
<i>I could smell
the fear of the other dog.</i>

710
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:27,703
He must be down here.
These are his dogs.

711
00:52:30,504 --> 00:52:32,438
- Here! Here!
- Come on.

712
00:52:35,671 --> 00:52:37,501
Is he breathing?

713
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:40,301
Call 911.

714
00:52:40,303 --> 00:52:41,703
Okay, head up.

715
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:45,102
- Is he gonna make it?
- Yeah.

716
00:52:45,104 --> 00:52:46,335
You saved his life.

717
00:52:46,337 --> 00:52:48,868
What about the dogs?
These are his.

718
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:51,201
I mean,
I guess that's up to you guys.

719
00:52:51,203 --> 00:52:53,371
We can call Animal Control for
you, but we can't wait for them.

720
00:52:55,503 --> 00:52:57,271
Sorry, guys. Good luck.

721
00:52:58,871 --> 00:53:00,138
I guess
they go with us.

722
00:53:01,738 --> 00:53:03,400
Come on, dogs.

723
00:53:03,402 --> 00:53:04,669
Big Kitten!

724
00:53:04,671 --> 00:53:06,834
Come on.
Come on.

725
00:53:06,836 --> 00:53:09,370
- Don't take me away from her.
- She needs me.

726
00:53:12,437 --> 00:53:15,535
Come on, dogs. Come on.

727
00:53:15,537 --> 00:53:16,938
No.

728
00:53:18,369 --> 00:53:21,172
Come on. Come on.

729
00:53:24,803 --> 00:53:26,437
Please.

730
00:53:32,237 --> 00:53:34,670
Dutch, come here.

731
00:53:36,371 --> 00:53:39,368
Come on, girl.
You can trust us.

732
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:42,205
Why do I get the feeling
you're secretly enjoying this?

733
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,868
I like dogs.

734
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:46,502
We need to feed
this girl more, though.

735
00:53:46,504 --> 00:53:49,434
- You can see her ribs.
- Out.

736
00:53:49,436 --> 00:53:51,769
Hey, no, no, no, no.
No. Don't scratch.

737
00:53:51,771 --> 00:53:52,868
What's your name?

738
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:55,334
Molly? Ellie?

739
00:53:55,336 --> 00:53:56,601
Let me out.

740
00:53:56,603 --> 00:53:59,001
- Blanche.
- Blanche?

741
00:53:59,003 --> 00:54:00,535
You gotta
be kidding me.

742
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:02,367
My mother's dog
was named Blanche.

743
00:54:02,369 --> 00:54:05,902
Well, that explains a lot.

744
00:54:07,238 --> 00:54:09,002
See?
He likes it here.

745
00:54:09,004 --> 00:54:11,869
Gavin, we have to
give the guy his dogs back.

746
00:54:11,871 --> 00:54:14,102
I like
<i>The Golden Girls.</i>

747
00:54:14,104 --> 00:54:17,770
<i>Ever so faintly,
I could smell Big Kitten on the wind.</i>

748
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:21,567
<i>She was waiting for me.</i>

749
00:54:21,569 --> 00:54:26,834
<i>And beyond her,
Lucas and Go Home.</i>

750
00:54:26,836 --> 00:54:30,503
Beatrice?
Millie? Sophie?

751
00:54:31,503 --> 00:54:33,235
Sadie?

752
00:54:33,237 --> 00:54:34,438
Chloe?

753
00:54:35,638 --> 00:54:36,604
Bella.

754
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:41,534
Bella.

755
00:54:41,536 --> 00:54:45,335
Bella! See? See, I told you.
It's Bella. That's a good dog.

756
00:54:45,337 --> 00:54:47,401
- How did he know my name?
- Your name is Bella.

757
00:54:47,403 --> 00:54:49,769
When we get back to the city,
yeah, I'm gonna get you

758
00:54:49,771 --> 00:54:51,201
a tag with your name on it.

759
00:54:51,203 --> 00:54:53,401
I am. Yes, I am.

760
00:54:53,403 --> 00:54:55,738
Gavin.

761
00:55:09,203 --> 00:55:11,771
<i>Dutch liked it here,
and so did I.</i>

762
00:55:14,404 --> 00:55:16,205
<i>We had food
whenever we needed it.</i>

763
00:55:17,937 --> 00:55:18,938
Want a snack?

764
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:22,671
<i>We were
inside and warm.</i>

765
00:55:27,302 --> 00:55:30,534
<i>Dutch and I had a
soft spot to sleep on.</i>

766
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:32,071
<i>And each other.</i>

767
00:55:35,003 --> 00:55:38,071
<i>It started to feel like home.</i>

768
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:51,771
- Hey.
- Hey.

769
00:55:53,937 --> 00:55:55,502
What's this?

770
00:55:55,504 --> 00:55:57,804
To celebrate you
finishing your novel.

771
00:56:02,269 --> 00:56:03,770
Hey. Come here.

772
00:56:06,203 --> 00:56:09,769
Did you put our phone number
on their dog tags?

773
00:56:09,771 --> 00:56:12,471
Well, whose number would I put on it?

774
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:23,401
<i>This smell was familiar.</i>

775
00:56:23,403 --> 00:56:24,502
You helping me?

776
00:56:24,504 --> 00:56:26,634
You like doing laundry, Bella?

777
00:56:26,636 --> 00:56:28,502
- Hello.
- <i>Doing Laundry? I knew that game.</i>

778
00:56:28,504 --> 00:56:29,968
Guess you do, huh?

779
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,171
Yeah.

780
00:56:35,136 --> 00:56:36,568
What is it?

781
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:39,501
Uh, can you
excuse me, please?

782
00:56:39,503 --> 00:56:42,036
That guy from the avalanche...
His sister.

783
00:56:42,038 --> 00:56:43,771
He's out of the hospital.

784
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,236
I'm sorry, I...

785
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:51,337
Yes, I'm sure he is.

786
00:57:09,736 --> 00:57:12,501
<i>Dutch had definitely
been here before.</i>

787
00:57:12,503 --> 00:57:14,904
<i>He had marked just about
everything in the yard.</i>

788
00:57:16,169 --> 00:57:17,237
Easy, Dutch. Easy.

789
00:57:20,504 --> 00:57:23,568
Hello? Mr. Kurch?

790
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:26,002
- Come on, Bella.
- Mr. Kurch? Hello?

791
00:57:26,004 --> 00:57:27,005
Back here.

792
00:57:30,804 --> 00:57:33,371
Aw! Geez! Oh, Dutch.

793
00:57:33,904 --> 00:57:35,335
Get down!

794
00:57:35,337 --> 00:57:37,168
Well, Dutch is just
happy to see you.

795
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:40,234
I got 11 freaking fractures,
and the dog's jumping all over me.

796
00:57:40,236 --> 00:57:42,567
Get off of me,
stupid dog!

797
00:57:42,569 --> 00:57:44,502
<i>Dutch was
happy to see this man,</i>

798
00:57:44,504 --> 00:57:47,036
<i>but what kind of a man
wouldn't be happy to see Dutch?</i>

799
00:57:47,038 --> 00:57:49,234
I'm Taylor. This is Gavin.

800
00:57:49,236 --> 00:57:50,468
We're the ones
who dug you out.

801
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:52,367
I don't remember
any of that.

802
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:56,068
All I know is my sister says
you're bringing the dog over,

803
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:57,438
which is ridiculous.

804
00:57:58,169 --> 00:57:59,869
Ridiculous?

805
00:57:59,871 --> 00:58:01,668
I don't understand you.

806
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:04,835
Do I look like I can
take care of a dog?

807
00:58:04,837 --> 00:58:06,369
But they're your dogs.

808
00:58:06,371 --> 00:58:09,071
Dogs? I never even seen
that other one before.

809
00:58:11,236 --> 00:58:12,901
Bella's not yours?

810
00:58:12,903 --> 00:58:14,702
But she was trying
to dig you out.

811
00:58:14,704 --> 00:58:15,971
I'm not taking either one.

812
00:58:18,069 --> 00:58:20,567
But you have to
take Dutch at least.

813
00:58:20,569 --> 00:58:22,402
Whatever you're doing
with that other one,

814
00:58:22,404 --> 00:58:23,771
do the same thing with Dutch.

815
00:58:28,836 --> 00:58:29,837
Come on, dogs.

816
00:58:31,703 --> 00:58:33,835
Let's go, Dutch.
Come on.

817
00:58:33,837 --> 00:58:34,838
Come on.

818
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:39,771
- Come on.
- That man belongs alone.

819
00:58:46,838 --> 00:58:48,202
Come here.

820
00:58:48,204 --> 00:58:49,634
Come here, Bella.

821
00:58:49,636 --> 00:58:50,736
- Good girl.
- Hey.

822
00:58:53,002 --> 00:58:56,000
So, now, we have two big,
slobbery dogs.

823
00:58:56,002 --> 00:58:58,234
Just like I've always wanted.

824
00:58:58,236 --> 00:59:01,102
Oh, they're good dogs.

825
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:03,202
- Yeah, they are.
- Hey, come here.

826
00:59:03,204 --> 00:59:05,267
- Come here, Bella. Come here.
- There you are.

827
00:59:05,269 --> 00:59:06,870
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

828
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:13,034
<i>The snow was gone,
but I knew where I was.</i>

829
00:59:13,036 --> 00:59:15,771
<i>I was near the last place
I saw Big Kitten.</i>

830
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:19,267
<i>And suddenly, I felt it.</i>

831
00:59:19,269 --> 00:59:25,401
<i>The pull of that invisible
leash, stronger than ever.</i>

832
00:59:25,403 --> 00:59:27,569
You know what we should do?
Go to the pet store.

833
00:59:27,571 --> 00:59:28,738
We need to get dog food.

834
00:59:30,838 --> 00:59:33,335
<i>Dutch
wanted me to stay.</i>

835
00:59:33,337 --> 00:59:36,335
- <i>To be part of this new family.</i>
- Hey, hey! Hey, dogs! No, no, no.

836
00:59:36,337 --> 00:59:38,402
No, that's too far.

837
00:59:38,404 --> 00:59:40,500
- Come on!
- Come here.

838
00:59:40,502 --> 00:59:41,502
- <i>It would have been so easy.</i>
- Dogs! Hey, Dutch.

839
00:59:41,504 --> 00:59:44,001
- Dutch.
- Come on.

840
00:59:44,003 --> 00:59:46,869
- Hey, dogs.
- Come. Bella.

841
00:59:46,871 --> 00:59:47,904
Dutch.

842
00:59:49,069 --> 00:59:50,501
Dutch.

843
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:52,234
- Bella, come on.
- There we go.

844
00:59:52,236 --> 00:59:54,736
<i>Dutch had
finally gone home,</i>

845
00:59:54,738 --> 00:59:56,067
- <i>to a home he deserved.</i>
- All right. Good boy, Dutch.

846
00:59:56,069 --> 00:59:58,735
- Hey, come on, Bella.
- Come here.

847
00:59:58,737 --> 01:00:00,235
- Bella, come on.
- There you go. Stay. Stay.

848
01:00:00,237 --> 01:00:02,202
Bella!

849
01:00:02,204 --> 01:00:04,367
- Wait, Bella. Bella!
- Come here. Come here.

850
01:00:04,369 --> 01:00:05,571
Bella.

851
01:00:06,704 --> 01:00:07,934
Bella, come!

852
01:00:07,936 --> 01:00:09,934
Bella!

853
01:00:09,936 --> 01:00:12,868
<i>Dutch had found
his Lucas.</i>

854
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:14,602
- Come on. Come on, Bella.
- Bella.

855
01:00:14,604 --> 01:00:17,935
<i>Now,
I needed to find mine.</i>

856
01:00:17,937 --> 01:00:19,037
Bella!

857
01:00:59,738 --> 01:01:01,667
<i>I was hungry again.</i>

858
01:01:01,669 --> 01:01:03,701
<i>And I missed Big Kitten.</i>

859
01:01:03,703 --> 01:01:05,203
<i>And Dutch.</i>

860
01:01:06,935 --> 01:01:10,567
<i>I had to find people places,
so I could eat,</i>

861
01:01:10,569 --> 01:01:13,470
<i>even though they were
out of my way to do Go Home.</i>

862
01:01:21,236 --> 01:01:23,167
<i>I looked all over town,</i>

863
01:01:23,169 --> 01:01:25,470
<i>but all the good hunting
places were closed.</i>

864
01:01:26,902 --> 01:01:29,203
Wait, is that...

865
01:01:30,869 --> 01:01:31,937
Chicken!

866
01:01:40,237 --> 01:01:41,538
<i>And there it was.</i>

867
01:01:42,671 --> 01:01:44,504
<i>Like they knew I was coming.</i>

868
01:01:48,569 --> 01:01:50,537
Hey! Hey!

869
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:52,504
Stop the dog!

870
01:01:57,537 --> 01:01:59,067
Hey! Stop that dog!

871
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:08,669
Get him! I got him! Hey!

872
01:02:14,337 --> 01:02:17,604
Food on the floor
is always for the dog!

873
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:22,103
Chicken, chicken, chicken!

874
01:02:26,936 --> 01:02:29,269
<i>It was delicious.</i>

875
01:02:29,271 --> 01:02:31,768
<i>Big Kitten
would have loved it.</i>

876
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:35,202
Hey, maybe you could
use some of this, huh?

877
01:02:35,204 --> 01:02:36,438
Little water there?

878
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:39,071
Attagirl.

879
01:02:40,503 --> 01:02:42,902
Attagirl.

880
01:02:42,904 --> 01:02:44,800
Good, baby.

881
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:46,800
It's all right. Hey.

882
01:02:46,802 --> 01:02:49,702
Yeah, you're beautiful.
Yeah.

883
01:02:49,704 --> 01:02:51,468
Hey, what's this here?

884
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:54,735
Yeah, let's see.
Yeah, dog tag.

885
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:56,835
It's Bella.

886
01:02:56,837 --> 01:02:59,234
Yeah, they gave me
a dog tag, too.

887
01:02:59,236 --> 01:03:01,000
He knew my name.

888
01:03:01,002 --> 01:03:02,800
- Have I seen him before?
- Even without the tags,

889
01:03:02,802 --> 01:03:07,601
they got my biometric
data on file.

890
01:03:07,603 --> 01:03:08,834
Come on.

891
01:03:08,836 --> 01:03:10,235
Attagirl.

892
01:03:10,237 --> 01:03:12,870
- No.
- Attagirl.

893
01:03:17,035 --> 01:03:18,602
<i>His name was Axel,</i>

894
01:03:18,604 --> 01:03:20,538
<i>and he always
had me on a leash.</i>

895
01:03:24,604 --> 01:03:26,667
- Aw! Hi, sweet girl.
- Hi.

896
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:29,702
You are so sweet.

897
01:03:29,704 --> 01:03:31,501
- Here you go.
- Bye.

898
01:03:31,503 --> 01:03:32,470
Thank you.

899
01:03:38,336 --> 01:03:39,634
Whoo-wee.

900
01:03:39,636 --> 01:03:42,502
Good for business, Bella.

901
01:03:42,504 --> 01:03:44,468
<i>Something
about him was familiar.</i>

902
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:46,104
Oh.

903
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:53,234
<i>Axel was sad
the way Mack was sad.</i>

904
01:03:53,236 --> 01:03:55,671
<i>The way Mom was sad.</i>

905
01:03:59,536 --> 01:04:02,900
<i>I wanted to go have fun
like I did with the pack,</i>

906
01:04:02,902 --> 01:04:06,234
<i>but Axel didn't understand
that dogs need to play.</i>

907
01:04:06,236 --> 01:04:08,869
Shh. Easy, girl.

908
01:04:11,735 --> 01:04:13,167
<i>We kept
each other warm.</i>

909
01:04:13,169 --> 01:04:14,734
Good dog.

910
01:04:14,736 --> 01:04:16,570
<i>He made sure
I was never hungry.</i>

911
01:04:17,702 --> 01:04:19,736
Good dog, Bella.

912
01:04:28,237 --> 01:04:30,137
<i>Slowly,
the air got warmer.</i>

913
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:37,270
<i>But Axel got
sadder and sadder.</i>

914
01:04:46,036 --> 01:04:50,036
<i>I didn't think Axel would ever
take me off the leash.</i>

915
01:05:12,237 --> 01:05:14,935
<i>I didn't like being chained.</i>

916
01:05:14,937 --> 01:05:17,601
<i>It didn't feel right.</i>

917
01:05:17,603 --> 01:05:21,937
<i>I didn't know how to help Axel
and still take care of myself.</i>

918
01:05:23,403 --> 01:05:25,835
<i>I needed to do Go Home.</i>

919
01:05:25,837 --> 01:05:27,368
I love you.

920
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:28,904
It's just me and you.

921
01:05:32,003 --> 01:05:35,201
You're the only friend
I've got.

922
01:05:35,203 --> 01:05:37,201
I love you, Bella.

923
01:05:37,203 --> 01:05:39,568
I love you.

924
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:40,869
It's you and me, Bella.

925
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:42,571
You and me.

926
01:05:46,736 --> 01:05:50,333
Bella,
I love you.

927
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:52,701
I love you, Bella.

928
01:05:52,703 --> 01:05:53,837
I love you.

929
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:09,234
<i>I laid with Axel while the
heat slowly drained away from him,</i>

930
01:06:09,236 --> 01:06:11,834
<i>until there was no more Axel</i>

931
01:06:11,836 --> 01:06:14,470
<i>and he was no longer sad.</i>

932
01:06:34,536 --> 01:06:36,666
<i>I sat, being a good dog,</i>

933
01:06:36,668 --> 01:06:38,969
<i>thinking someone
would come for me.</i>

934
01:06:44,404 --> 01:06:46,003
<i>Nobody came.</i>

935
01:06:50,803 --> 01:06:53,036
<i>Being a good dog didn't work.</i>

936
01:07:09,471 --> 01:07:12,603
<i>It was as if the whole world
had forgotten me.</i>

937
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:16,969
<i>But I couldn't give up.</i>

938
01:07:26,703 --> 01:07:28,438
<i>I was so thirsty.</i>

939
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:33,636
<i>I needed water.</i>

940
01:08:15,736 --> 01:08:17,937
<i>Okay, Bella,
this is very important.</i>

941
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:20,601
You ready? All right.

942
01:08:20,603 --> 01:08:21,937
Go home.

943
01:08:23,169 --> 01:08:25,136
That's it.

944
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:27,834
Go home, Bella.

945
01:08:27,836 --> 01:08:29,568
<i>Go home.</i>

946
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:30,835
Come on,
there's a cool path down here.

947
01:08:30,837 --> 01:08:32,767
Hey, wait! Wait for me!

948
01:08:32,769 --> 01:08:35,603
- Hurry up. You're always slow.
- No, I'm not.

949
01:08:40,169 --> 01:08:42,402
Hey, look. A dog.

950
01:08:43,736 --> 01:08:45,103
People.

951
01:08:49,337 --> 01:08:51,467
- What's the matter with it?
- I don't know.

952
01:08:51,469 --> 01:08:52,901
Careful it doesn't
have rabies.

953
01:08:52,903 --> 01:08:54,968
Doesn't have rabies,
you moron.

954
01:08:54,970 --> 01:08:57,533
It's stuck. Good dog.

955
01:08:57,535 --> 01:08:59,800
Good dog.

956
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:00,937
It's chained to something.

957
01:09:10,303 --> 01:09:11,734
- What... What is it?
- There's a body over there.

958
01:09:11,736 --> 01:09:13,134
No way.

959
01:09:13,136 --> 01:09:15,234
- The dog's chained to it.
- Is he dead?

960
01:09:15,236 --> 01:09:16,237
I think so.

961
01:09:18,536 --> 01:09:19,670
What are
you gonna do?

962
01:09:20,669 --> 01:09:21,636
Good dog.

963
01:09:30,102 --> 01:09:32,036
<i>Water never
tasted so good.</i>

964
01:09:43,601 --> 01:09:47,768
<i>I knew now that my journey was
much longer than I'd ever imagined.</i>

965
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:49,534
<i>Two winters.</i>

966
01:09:49,536 --> 01:09:52,901
<i>How many more winters
would there be?</i>

967
01:09:52,903 --> 01:09:55,071
<i>And how many more
could I take?</i>

968
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:12,801
<i>Their smell was everywhere.</i>

969
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:21,503
<i>They were
hunting me again.</i>

970
01:10:28,037 --> 01:10:29,834
<i>I knew they would come.</i>

971
01:10:32,535 --> 01:10:35,399
<i>But I wasn't gonna let them
think I was afraid.</i>

972
01:12:37,868 --> 01:12:39,469
Is that...

973
01:13:00,802 --> 01:13:02,801
It is Big Kitten.

974
01:13:02,803 --> 01:13:05,170
And she's a big,
big kitten now.

975
01:13:47,835 --> 01:13:51,135
<i>It felt so good
to be together again.</i>

976
01:13:52,936 --> 01:13:55,667
<i>And I could tell
Big Kitten felt the same.</i>

977
01:14:19,302 --> 01:14:22,868
<i>I knew Lucas would be
excited to meet Big Kitten.</i>

978
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:26,003
<i>And we would all
sleep together in the bed.</i>

979
01:14:29,903 --> 01:14:33,703
<i>Lucas was definitely
gonna need a bigger bed.</i>

980
01:14:37,668 --> 01:14:38,969
Now,
that's a new smell.

981
01:14:48,236 --> 01:14:50,270
I don't know what those are,
and I don't want to know.

982
01:14:59,201 --> 01:15:00,270
Big Kitten!

983
01:15:24,469 --> 01:15:26,500
There it is.

984
01:15:26,502 --> 01:15:28,770
Go Home and Lucas.

985
01:15:36,903 --> 01:15:39,667
<i>Big Kitten wanted me
to follow her,</i>

986
01:15:39,669 --> 01:15:41,235
<i>and I wanted her to follow me.</i>

987
01:15:54,269 --> 01:15:57,400
<i>I knew then that Big Kitten
would not be coming home with me</i>

988
01:15:57,402 --> 01:15:58,470
<i>to sleep on the bed.</i>

989
01:16:09,001 --> 01:16:12,536
I will always be
your mother cat.

990
01:16:27,370 --> 01:16:28,936
<i>I loved Big Kitten.</i>

991
01:16:31,036 --> 01:16:32,868
<i>But I knew I would
never see her again.</i>

992
01:17:40,668 --> 01:17:43,333
Oh! A dog!

993
01:17:43,335 --> 01:17:45,300
Puppy, come here!
Come here, puppy!

994
01:17:45,302 --> 01:17:47,700
Come here! Come here, puppy!

995
01:17:47,702 --> 01:17:48,935
- You okay?
- Yeah.

996
01:17:49,902 --> 01:17:52,033
Just stop. Please.

997
01:17:52,035 --> 01:17:54,166
What's happening?

998
01:17:54,168 --> 01:17:55,800
- Come on.
- Please stop.

999
01:17:55,802 --> 01:17:57,833
- Here, boy.
- Come here.

1000
01:17:57,835 --> 01:17:59,103
Come here, girl. Come here.

1001
01:18:39,203 --> 01:18:41,266
Come here, baby.

1002
01:18:44,269 --> 01:18:48,103
<i>It hurt so much,
but I had to keep going.</i>

1003
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:03,703
<i>The streets and the houses
started to look familiar.</i>

1004
01:19:09,602 --> 01:19:11,702
<i>I finally did
what Lucas told me.</i>

1005
01:19:12,503 --> 01:19:15,537
<i>I did Go Home.</i>

1006
01:19:28,168 --> 01:19:30,234
Lucas! Mom!

1007
01:19:30,236 --> 01:19:32,370
- Who's there?
- Lucas!

1008
01:19:33,735 --> 01:19:35,167
Oh, oh.

1009
01:19:35,169 --> 01:19:37,067
Okay, you can't be
in here. Come on.

1010
01:19:37,069 --> 01:19:38,500
Come on. Right,
let's go outside.

1011
01:19:38,502 --> 01:19:40,866
<i>Everything
was different.</i>

1012
01:19:40,868 --> 01:19:42,200
Come on. Come on.

1013
01:19:42,202 --> 01:19:43,566
I'll give you a treat
if you come outside.

1014
01:19:43,568 --> 01:19:45,701
Lucas? Mom?

1015
01:19:45,703 --> 01:19:47,301
Goodness.

1016
01:19:47,303 --> 01:19:50,032
Where were they?

1017
01:19:50,034 --> 01:19:53,234
There's a stray dog that just
pushed its way into my house.

1018
01:19:53,236 --> 01:19:57,736
<i>I could smell they had
been gone for a long, long time.</i>

1019
01:20:04,801 --> 01:20:09,236
<i>I tried so hard,
and I'd come so far.</i>

1020
01:20:11,069 --> 01:20:14,336
<i>I just couldn't
take another step.</i>

1021
01:20:23,402 --> 01:20:25,634
Mother Cat?

1022
01:20:25,636 --> 01:20:27,769
How did you
get so small?

1023
01:20:35,969 --> 01:20:37,603
- Call about a stray dog?
- I did.

1024
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:41,069
- You.
- You.

1025
01:20:49,835 --> 01:20:54,537
<i>Mother Cat watched me
leave, just like Big Kitten did.</i>

1026
01:20:58,936 --> 01:21:01,136
<i>I guess that's how
cats say goodbye.</i>

1027
01:21:11,868 --> 01:21:15,403
<i>There was just one more place
to look for Lucas.</i>

1028
01:21:17,103 --> 01:21:19,000
- That's good.
- Later.

1029
01:21:19,002 --> 01:21:21,236
- See you.
- Bye.

1030
01:21:33,867 --> 01:21:35,733
- Dogs?
- Yeah, that's a good boy.

1031
01:21:35,735 --> 01:21:37,403
I used to
be the only one.

1032
01:21:40,769 --> 01:21:42,201
- Um, Olivia?
- What?

1033
01:21:42,203 --> 01:21:44,033
I think a stray dog
just came through.

1034
01:21:50,535 --> 01:21:52,499
The alarm goes off,
I get up.

1035
01:21:52,501 --> 01:21:53,768
I got somewhere to go.

1036
01:21:54,635 --> 01:21:56,069
I like the job.

1037
01:22:06,636 --> 01:22:07,601
No way.

1038
01:22:12,702 --> 01:22:13,900
Can't be.

1039
01:22:21,836 --> 01:22:22,836
Bella?

1040
01:22:24,370 --> 01:22:27,170
It is her! Come here!
Come here, girl.

1041
01:22:30,635 --> 01:22:32,103
What happened to you, girl?

1042
01:22:37,368 --> 01:22:38,437
What? What is it?

1043
01:22:41,568 --> 01:22:43,601
- No.
- Lucas?

1044
01:22:45,734 --> 01:22:46,736
It can't be.

1045
01:22:47,402 --> 01:22:48,900
Bella!

1046
01:23:06,168 --> 01:23:08,568
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas!

1047
01:23:10,735 --> 01:23:13,701
Bella,
Bella! You're alive.

1048
01:23:18,936 --> 01:23:20,566
I can't believe it.

1049
01:23:20,568 --> 01:23:22,434
Bella, where have you
been all this time?

1050
01:23:22,436 --> 01:23:25,032
- Is that Bella?
- Yeah, it is. It really is.

1051
01:23:25,034 --> 01:23:26,666
Bella!

1052
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:28,666
Oh, my God. It's been
like two and a half years.

1053
01:23:28,668 --> 01:23:32,001
- Hi.
- Lucas! Olivia! Mom!

1054
01:23:32,003 --> 01:23:33,599
I did Go Home!

1055
01:23:33,601 --> 01:23:35,602
- She came home.
- I know, I know.

1056
01:23:45,202 --> 01:23:46,901
Can you call the vet,
tell him we're on the way?

1057
01:23:46,903 --> 01:23:49,101
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I'll get the car.

1058
01:23:49,103 --> 01:23:52,236
Lucas? Lucas, there's an officer outside
who says you have to bring that dog out.

1059
01:23:54,203 --> 01:23:55,203
I'm so sorry.

1060
01:23:56,669 --> 01:23:57,669
Come on.

1061
01:23:58,701 --> 01:23:59,702
You kidding?

1062
01:24:01,135 --> 01:24:02,632
All right, everybody.

1063
01:24:02,634 --> 01:24:05,034
No big deal.
Nothing to worry about.

1064
01:24:05,036 --> 01:24:06,966
I'm just here
for that pit bull.

1065
01:24:06,968 --> 01:24:09,299
And if any
of you interfere,

1066
01:24:09,301 --> 01:24:11,833
these officers,
they will arrest you.

1067
01:24:11,835 --> 01:24:13,866
We don't want any trouble,

1068
01:24:13,868 --> 01:24:17,532
but we have to
take that animal.

1069
01:24:17,534 --> 01:24:19,667
I thought I'd see why
half the department

1070
01:24:19,669 --> 01:24:22,799
is out here on a routine
Animal Control call.

1071
01:24:22,801 --> 01:24:24,867
Anybody want to fill me in?

1072
01:24:24,869 --> 01:24:28,299
Captain, I'm here for a confiscation,
and some of these people,

1073
01:24:28,301 --> 01:24:31,067
they're trying to turn it
into some kind of a situation.

1074
01:24:31,069 --> 01:24:35,166
It's obstruction,
harboring a dangerous animal,

1075
01:24:35,168 --> 01:24:37,066
and disobeying
a lawful order.

1076
01:24:37,068 --> 01:24:39,532
Uh-huh.

1077
01:24:39,534 --> 01:24:43,169
Well, which one of you is
responsible for this crime spree?

1078
01:24:46,403 --> 01:24:48,502
I thought it might be
something like that.

1079
01:24:50,667 --> 01:24:52,333
That a pit bull?

1080
01:24:52,335 --> 01:24:54,034
Doesn't look like
a pit bull to me.

1081
01:24:54,036 --> 01:24:57,532
She's my dog, sir,
and she's hurt.

1082
01:24:57,534 --> 01:24:58,999
I'm taking her to the vet.

1083
01:24:59,001 --> 01:25:00,699
Well, I'm sorry to tell you
that Chuck's right.

1084
01:25:00,701 --> 01:25:03,032
We have to take your dog
in to the shelter.

1085
01:25:03,034 --> 01:25:05,199
All right.

1086
01:25:05,201 --> 01:25:07,099
But to do so,
you've got to go through

1087
01:25:07,101 --> 01:25:09,500
the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine
Division, United States Marine Corps.

1088
01:25:09,502 --> 01:25:11,200
1st Infantry, Army.

1089
01:25:11,202 --> 01:25:14,001
82nd Airborne Division,
U.S. Army.

1090
01:25:14,003 --> 01:25:15,834
6th Fleet, United States Navy.

1091
01:25:15,836 --> 01:25:18,565
101st Airborne,
Screaming Eagles.

1092
01:25:18,567 --> 01:25:21,900
4th Infantry Division,
United States Army.

1093
01:25:21,902 --> 01:25:23,701
You really want
this thing to escalate?

1094
01:25:24,535 --> 01:25:25,536
Do you?

1095
01:25:27,668 --> 01:25:31,000
Ma'am, my job is
to enforce the law,

1096
01:25:31,002 --> 01:25:33,866
and the law says
I've got to impound this dog.

1097
01:25:33,868 --> 01:25:36,333
Now, if that means
Tasers and pepper spray,

1098
01:25:36,335 --> 01:25:38,067
then that's what it means.

1099
01:25:38,069 --> 01:25:40,034
Under Denver city
ordinance 8-...

1100
01:25:40,036 --> 01:25:41,236
Wait.

1101
01:25:43,902 --> 01:25:45,167
He said "Denver."

1102
01:25:45,169 --> 01:25:46,136
That's right.

1103
01:25:47,334 --> 01:25:48,766
But this isn't Denver.

1104
01:25:48,768 --> 01:25:51,398
- This is federal property.
- It's what?

1105
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,667
The VA Hospital
is federal property.

1106
01:25:53,669 --> 01:25:57,699
It isn't technically a part
of the City of Denver.

1107
01:25:57,701 --> 01:25:59,666
So, that's it, Captain.

1108
01:25:59,668 --> 01:26:01,402
There doesn't have to be a fight,
'cause you don't have jurisdiction.

1109
01:26:02,634 --> 01:26:03,601
Hmm.

1110
01:26:06,036 --> 01:26:08,899
So, where did you two serve?

1111
01:26:08,901 --> 01:26:10,435
- Basra.
- Kabul.

1112
01:26:11,336 --> 01:26:12,736
Hue, Tet Offensive.

1113
01:26:15,068 --> 01:26:18,666
All right. Show's over.
Let's pack it up.

1114
01:26:18,668 --> 01:26:20,533
Yeah.

1115
01:26:20,535 --> 01:26:23,467
If I see this dog leave the
premises, I will pull your car over.

1116
01:26:23,469 --> 01:26:25,399
No, you won't.

1117
01:26:25,401 --> 01:26:28,034
Chuck, I get more
complaints about you

1118
01:26:28,036 --> 01:26:32,067
than all the other
ACOs combined.

1119
01:26:32,069 --> 01:26:34,402
Turn that vehicle in.
I'm pulling you out of the field.

1120
01:26:36,203 --> 01:26:41,203
And nobody is pulling
anyone over for a dog.

1121
01:26:42,669 --> 01:26:43,869
Got it?

1122
01:26:44,635 --> 01:26:45,668
Good.

1123
01:26:50,301 --> 01:26:52,565
Oh, my gosh, Bella,
we missed you so much.

1124
01:26:52,567 --> 01:26:54,566
I don't understand
what just happened,

1125
01:26:54,568 --> 01:26:57,069
but I'm pretty sure
it was good.

1126
01:27:07,935 --> 01:27:10,699
Oh, look what
I found in the chest.

1127
01:27:10,701 --> 01:27:12,166
I totally forgot.

1128
01:27:12,168 --> 01:27:14,101
- Come here.
- Remember this, Bella?

1129
01:27:14,103 --> 01:27:17,365
My Lucas blanket!

1130
01:27:17,367 --> 01:27:20,233
- I wanted to try something.
- Yeah.

1131
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:23,167
This was her favorite thing
when she was little.

1132
01:27:23,169 --> 01:27:27,066
But after all she's been through,
I don't know if she'll remember.

1133
01:27:27,068 --> 01:27:30,667
Bella, do you want...

1134
01:27:30,669 --> 01:27:35,099
- A tiny piece of cheese.
- ...a tiny piece of cheese?

1135
01:27:37,601 --> 01:27:38,769
She does remember.

1136
01:27:41,502 --> 01:27:43,400
She's an amazing dog.

1137
01:27:43,402 --> 01:27:45,202
She really is.

1138
01:27:54,036 --> 01:27:56,366
<i>I was really home</i>

1139
01:27:56,368 --> 01:27:58,803
<i>with Lucas, and Olivia, too.</i>

1140
01:28:01,202 --> 01:28:04,399
<i>I was where I needed to be.</i>

1141
01:28:15,301 --> 01:28:18,201
<i>And Big Kitten was
where she needed to be.</i>

1142
01:28:42,036 --> 01:28:43,733
<i>I finally understood</i>

1143
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:45,832
<i>that the invisible leash
that led me to Lucas</i>

1144
01:28:45,834 --> 01:28:47,867
<i>was made of love.</i>

1145
01:28:47,869 --> 01:28:50,232
<i>He was my person.</i>

1146
01:28:50,234 --> 01:28:53,234
<i>And I was his dog.</i>

1147
01:30:22,704 --> 01:30:27,704
