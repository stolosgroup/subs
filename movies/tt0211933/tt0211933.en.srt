1
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,950
<i>People die.</i>

2
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:54,819
<i>You may think you can
control when or where</i>

3
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,987
<i>or how it happens, but you can't.</i>

4
00:02:00,028 --> 00:02:04,192
<i>When your number is up,
your number is up,</i>

5
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:07,463
<i>and there's nothing
anyone can do about it.</i>

6
00:02:07,536 --> 00:02:08,468
<i>Charge.</i>

7
00:02:11,456 --> 00:02:13,481
It's over, Jack.

8
00:02:15,377 --> 00:02:18,505
<i>I've lost patients before,</i>

9
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,573
<i>seen them die on my table,
under my knife.</i>

10
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:24,516
I'm sorry, Jack.

11
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:28,215
<i>But I've never lost a friend.</i>

12
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,817
<i>I lost Clayton at 6:32 a.m.</i>

13
00:02:31,893 --> 00:02:35,761
<i>on Thursday,
the first day of November.</i>

14
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:43,666
<i>There's not much I can
tell you about that day.</i>

15
00:02:43,738 --> 00:02:45,638
<i>I don't know if he
woke up that morning</i>

16
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,870
<i>thinking he might die.</i>

17
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:53,506
<i>I only know the day started
much like any other day,</i>

18
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:56,449
<i>and that he was probably thinking of her.</i>

19
00:03:59,181 --> 00:04:00,876
Hey.

20
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,075
Hey.

21
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,113
What were you doing under there?

22
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:08,888
Just thinking.

23
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,619
What about?

24
00:04:12,694 --> 00:04:14,821
Wait, let me guess.

25
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:20,732
You were thinking about
making love to me all morning

26
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,566
and then taking me out
for a really big breakfast.

27
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,163
- Close.
- Yeah?

28
00:04:29,344 --> 00:04:32,142
Actually, I was...

29
00:04:32,214 --> 00:04:35,012
picturing you soaking wet
with all of your clothes on.

30
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,482
- No. Mm-mm.
- Mm-hmm.

31
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:37,950
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-hmm.

32
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:11,310
- Dah. Ah.
- Oh.

33
00:05:11,386 --> 00:05:12,318
Damn it.

34
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:15,220
All right, hang on.

35
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,155
Tell me if it hurts, okay?

36
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,823
- Ah!
- Shit.

37
00:05:19,894 --> 00:05:22,260
You're such an asshole.

38
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,423
- Come here.
- I didn't scare you, did I?

39
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:26,126
You did.

40
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,294
There we go.

41
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,496
How's it look?

42
00:05:29,571 --> 00:05:31,061
You'll live.

43
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:42,407
Thank you.

44
00:05:46,588 --> 00:05:47,555
Have you seen my pager?

45
00:05:47,622 --> 00:05:49,681
- Yep.
- Ah.

46
00:05:49,758 --> 00:05:51,692
Wait. Hang on.

47
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,524
- There you go.
- Thanks.

48
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:55,585
I don't care, Tommy.

49
00:05:55,664 --> 00:05:57,325
They open at 6,
we open at 5, all right?

50
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,331
There are jobs at stake, man.

51
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,231
Just get it done.

52
00:06:00,302 --> 00:06:03,271
Then we'll talk to them at
the Halloween thing tonight.

53
00:06:03,338 --> 00:06:04,635
Yeah, all right. I'll be in soon.

54
00:06:08,043 --> 00:06:09,874
Got time for a little breakfast?

55
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:11,536
You know I can't.

56
00:06:11,613 --> 00:06:14,138
You know, share a paper,
trade sections?

57
00:06:14,215 --> 00:06:16,376
Baby, I'm late as it is.

58
00:06:16,451 --> 00:06:19,215
I don't even know
what section you like, Clay.

59
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,567
I deserve my happily
ever after, too.

60
00:06:40,642 --> 00:06:44,271
I know you do.

61
00:06:44,346 --> 00:06:48,043
And I'm going to tell her, soon.

62
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,777
I promise.

63
00:06:53,888 --> 00:06:54,877
Have a good day.

64
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,685
You, too.

65
00:07:33,962 --> 00:07:36,328
Good morning, Mom.

66
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,138
Don't forget we're
meeting the board at 2.

67
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:49,267
I can't do 2.

68
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,538
I'm meeting with Dr. Harper
this afternoon.

69
00:07:50,612 --> 00:07:51,544
Just be there.

70
00:07:51,613 --> 00:07:53,103
These Japanese companies
are ruthless.

71
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,580
We have to close this merger.

72
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:57,413
Is this about your old man?

73
00:07:57,485 --> 00:07:59,180
Is it about him?

74
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:00,983
Jesus, I'm not going through this again, Jack.

75
00:08:01,055 --> 00:08:03,216
Honestly, he would
want you to tell her.

76
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,519
No, my father would want me

77
00:08:04,592 --> 00:08:06,219
to stop fishing
in the middle of the day

78
00:08:06,294 --> 00:08:07,761
and go back to work, all right?

79
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:10,127
If he knew what I was doing
with Sam, he'd disown me,

80
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,256
lying to my mom like this.

81
00:08:11,332 --> 00:08:13,857
He'd throw me in the fucking river.

82
00:08:13,935 --> 00:08:17,371
I want you to
take a good look around you, Clay.

83
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:19,805
You own half of this city.

84
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:23,776
You're creating jobs,
you're saving companies.

85
00:08:23,845 --> 00:08:26,609
I think you've more than
filled his shoes, you know?

86
00:08:26,681 --> 00:08:29,650
My dad's feet were four sizes bigger
than mine, Jack.

87
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,151
I can't even fill his socks.

88
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,778
Look, I got the rings, didn't I?

89
00:08:33,855 --> 00:08:34,879
I got the license.

90
00:08:34,956 --> 00:08:37,049
No, no, no, no.
It's not that difficult.

91
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,184
You set a date and you just do it.

92
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,625
It's not that easy, either.

93
00:08:40,695 --> 00:08:42,720
- I mean, marriage...
- Look, she's your mother.

94
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:46,460
You tell her and, I swear to you,
she'll be happy.

95
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:48,092
You don't know my mother.

96
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:49,397
Listen, thanks for the fishing lesson.

97
00:08:49,471 --> 00:08:50,699
- I'm leaving, all right?
- All right, man.

98
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:52,933
Look, just...
just come on with me.

99
00:08:54,876 --> 00:08:58,277
You know how many
bullshit malpractice lawsuits

100
00:08:58,346 --> 00:08:59,813
there are in this country?

101
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:02,111
I mean, a hard-working
doctor is trying...

102
00:09:02,183 --> 00:09:03,616
Are we going to go
through this again, Jack?

103
00:09:03,685 --> 00:09:05,448
- Well, look, I've got...
- Four. Yes, I know.

104
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,044
All for trying to save people's lives.

105
00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:08,486
It's a disgrace.

106
00:09:08,556 --> 00:09:09,784
Well, you know why they sue us?

107
00:09:09,858 --> 00:09:11,257
I have a very busy day.

108
00:09:11,326 --> 00:09:12,725
Please.

109
00:09:12,794 --> 00:09:16,696
It's because they don't know
what to do with their grief.

110
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:21,201
It's because people
need someone to blame.

111
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,466
It's because of patients like you

112
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:28,873
who cannot accept the facts.

113
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,535
Come on in.

114
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:33,410
Get acquainted. Lie down.

115
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,612
Only because you're my friend.

116
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:39,846
I'm your doctor.

117
00:09:45,326 --> 00:09:47,157
Get comfortable.

118
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:55,926
How's it feel?

119
00:09:56,004 --> 00:09:57,596
Not so bad.

120
00:09:57,672 --> 00:10:02,109
These, Clay, are the facts.

121
00:10:02,176 --> 00:10:05,976
When I open up your chest
and remove your heart,

122
00:10:06,047 --> 00:10:11,508
it is a very real possibility that you will die
right here on this table.

123
00:10:11,586 --> 00:10:14,453
And if the transplant is successful,

124
00:10:14,522 --> 00:10:19,482
there is a 50% chance
that you'll be dead in 10 years.

125
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:22,724
The clock's ticking.

126
00:10:22,797 --> 00:10:25,391
So it's tough love today, huh?

127
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:27,525
You think this is a joke?

128
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,296
Look at that.

129
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:33,840
Hold it.

130
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:36,308
That's surgical steel.

131
00:10:36,377 --> 00:10:38,971
A hundredth of an inch thick.

132
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:44,110
That thing will slice through you
as if you weren't even there.

133
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,583
Picture it, Clay.

134
00:10:48,656 --> 00:10:50,590
Picture the incision.

135
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,390
Imagine what it will be like.

136
00:10:56,998 --> 00:10:59,330
I need you to be ready.

137
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:03,828
I need you to be prepared.

138
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:07,238
You get your house
in order, just in case.

139
00:11:08,843 --> 00:11:13,473
Tell your mother, marry the girl,
and live your life.

140
00:11:14,616 --> 00:11:18,484
You might not have much of it left.

141
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,350
Okay?

142
00:11:20,421 --> 00:11:22,218
Jack...

143
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,621
saddle up.

144
00:11:23,691 --> 00:11:25,955
Wait, I thought we didn't
have anything until later.

145
00:11:26,027 --> 00:11:27,892
No, Riordan's cabbage
from this morning,

146
00:11:27,962 --> 00:11:28,894
he's in the ICU bleeding.

147
00:11:28,963 --> 00:11:30,362
He took off for
the fucking vineyard,

148
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,296
so, uh... Hey, Clay.

149
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:33,891
How about letting us
have all your money

150
00:11:33,968 --> 00:11:35,128
so that we could retire?

151
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:37,137
You wouldn't mind
doing that, would you?

152
00:11:37,205 --> 00:11:38,137
No. You know me.

153
00:11:38,206 --> 00:11:40,197
Go ahead, take it all.

154
00:11:40,274 --> 00:11:41,741
What a guy.

155
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:44,676
Remember what I said, Clay.

156
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,270
No regrets.

157
00:11:46,347 --> 00:11:47,279
Jack!

158
00:11:47,348 --> 00:11:49,145
The clock's ticking.

159
00:11:49,217 --> 00:11:50,149
Jack, what are you doing?

160
00:11:50,218 --> 00:11:52,209
Let's go.
Let's go, Jack.

161
00:11:52,286 --> 00:11:54,754
Come on!

162
00:11:54,822 --> 00:11:57,382
<i>Promise me you'll kiss me all over.</i>

163
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,982
Well, I've got a big
Halloween party tonight,

164
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,994
but how about
I sneak out afterward?

165
00:12:01,062 --> 00:12:02,757
<i>What's wrong with right now?</i>

166
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,229
Well, I can't. I'm...

167
00:12:04,298 --> 00:12:07,563
I know it's daylight
and all, but I missed you.

168
00:12:07,635 --> 00:12:10,035
You look beautiful, Sam.

169
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,731
I do?

170
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:13,637
Yeah, you do.

171
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,006
I should tell you that more often.

172
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,375
What's wrong?

173
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,939
I'm sorry.

174
00:12:23,017 --> 00:12:25,076
I didn't know she was going
to be here, all right?

175
00:12:25,153 --> 00:12:26,677
If I turn around, she'll see.

176
00:12:26,754 --> 00:12:29,120
This is getting boring, Clay.

177
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,350
Uh-huh.

178
00:12:30,425 --> 00:12:33,155
We're going to have to
discuss this merger later.

179
00:12:33,227 --> 00:12:34,717
I feel sick.

180
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:38,698
You're not supposed
to make me feel sick.

181
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:41,495
Thought you'd run off and left me.

182
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:43,628
You remember Dr. Neyer,
don't you?

183
00:12:43,705 --> 00:12:44,637
Hello, Clayton.

184
00:12:44,706 --> 00:12:45,695
Good to see you again.

185
00:12:45,773 --> 00:12:47,001
We've already been through this.

186
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:48,975
Dr. Harper's my surgeon.
I've already told you...

187
00:12:49,043 --> 00:12:51,944
I know, but Jonathan
leads the field, remember?

188
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:54,072
Yeah, well, like I said before,

189
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,116
I have a surgeon.

190
00:12:56,184 --> 00:12:59,779
Now, I know he's been
on the donor list for a year, Lilith,

191
00:12:59,854 --> 00:13:02,288
but that's completely
normal for his type.

192
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:06,986
O-negatives like you and your son
always wait a little longer.

193
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:09,552
It just means
you're special, that's all.

194
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,063
Excuse me.

195
00:13:11,132 --> 00:13:12,895
I don't think you're listening
to what I'm saying...

196
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:14,264
Although, since he has
a cardiomyopathy

197
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,597
of undetermined etiology...

198
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,570
Hey.

199
00:13:17,638 --> 00:13:18,662
I'm sitting right here.

200
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,140
You want to talk
about me, talk to me.

201
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:23,677
- Clay.
- It's fine, Lilith.

202
00:13:23,745 --> 00:13:27,010
You and Dr. Harper
have obviously become friends.

203
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:29,106
He was on call when you had
your first attack.

204
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,980
He saved your life.

205
00:13:31,052 --> 00:13:33,145
I get the attachment. Really, I do.

206
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:36,486
But your mother and I
have been friends for 15 years.

207
00:13:36,557 --> 00:13:39,048
My hands have been
inside presidents.

208
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:42,494
Don't you think I might at least
deserve the time of day?

209
00:13:42,563 --> 00:13:45,726
You want to be operated on
by the best surgeon possible.

210
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,633
Don't you, Clay?

211
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,965
Good.

212
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,071
Now let's talk about the party tonight.

213
00:13:54,075 --> 00:13:56,737
<i>No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.</i>

214
00:13:56,811 --> 00:13:58,369
<i>Now see, that is where
you're wrong.</i>

215
00:13:58,446 --> 00:14:00,539
<i>I just don't see
the growth in leadership.</i>

216
00:14:00,615 --> 00:14:02,549
<i>That's why this whole
Beresford Capital business</i>

217
00:14:02,617 --> 00:14:03,743
<i>scares me so much.</i>

218
00:14:03,818 --> 00:14:05,615
<i>Now look, are my numbers
wrong here?</i>

219
00:14:05,686 --> 00:14:08,348
<i>Because if the Shimotomo merger
does not go through soon,</i>

220
00:14:08,422 --> 00:14:10,515
<i>then that entire firm is in a lot of trouble.</i>

221
00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:12,252
<i>That doesn't matter.</i>

222
00:14:12,326 --> 00:14:14,988
<i>Look, I'm telling you,
Beresford better stay away from Shimotomo.</i>

223
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,290
<i>They're going to smile at your face,</i>

224
00:14:16,364 --> 00:14:17,888
<i>and then they're going
to stab you in the back.</i>

225
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:18,989
<i>These guys are dangerous.</i>

226
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,533
<i>Trust me, I've seen them do it.</i>

227
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:22,660
<i>Anybody who gets
into business with them</i>

228
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,204
<i>is really asking for trouble.</i>

229
00:14:24,272 --> 00:14:25,466
<i>Clay Beresford better know
what he's doing...</i>

230
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,474
Sir, they need you out there.

231
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:29,032
Thank you.

232
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:31,907
Welcome.

233
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:34,243
My daughter Tanya and my wife.

234
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,749
Happy Halloween.

235
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,826
Oh, here he is.

236
00:14:50,898 --> 00:14:52,229
Whiz kid of Wall Street,

237
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,097
<i>Barron's Man of the Year at 22:</i>

238
00:14:54,168 --> 00:14:55,999
Clayton Beresford, Jr.

239
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:01,406
Sir, I'd like you to meet
Mr. Inamoto and Mr. Waturi.

240
00:15:01,475 --> 00:15:04,000
They're with our friends
at Shimotomo.

241
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:05,272
They're here to check up on you.

242
00:15:05,346 --> 00:15:06,472
They know about your condition.

243
00:15:11,853 --> 00:15:13,650
Mr. Waturi would like for you to know

244
00:15:13,721 --> 00:15:15,450
how much respect he had
for your father,

245
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:16,649
Mr. Beresford.

246
00:15:16,724 --> 00:15:18,715
He was quite a businessman.

247
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,556
<i>Yes, he was. Arigato.</i>

248
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,727
Mr. Waturi would also like to know
how you're feeling today.

249
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:28,561
Well, you'll have to tell Mr. Waturi
that I feel fabulous.

250
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,166
Please also tell him that I'm ready

251
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,764
to cut to the chase
whenever he is.

252
00:15:34,842 --> 00:15:36,104
In the last eight quarters alone,

253
00:15:36,177 --> 00:15:38,805
we bought and nurtured
over 600 companies.

254
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,611
We donate 80 million
charitable dollars per annum.

255
00:15:42,683 --> 00:15:45,709
We provide over 16,000 jobs.

256
00:15:45,786 --> 00:15:49,950
Mr. Waturi, my heart may be weak,
but my mind is strong.

257
00:15:50,024 --> 00:15:51,514
And the only thing
you need to worry about

258
00:15:51,592 --> 00:15:53,526
is which one of our 17 Niigata sakes

259
00:15:53,594 --> 00:15:55,357
you'd like to enjoy with your dinner.

260
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:12,445
You're a ridiculous person,
you know that?

261
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,447
I don't know how you say that
with a straight face.

262
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,983
I mean, it's just... it's ridiculous.

263
00:16:17,051 --> 00:16:18,541
I'm serious this time.

264
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:20,917
Let's just leave
the country, you know?

265
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:22,751
Go to China.

266
00:16:22,823 --> 00:16:24,290
Try our luck on the black market.

267
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,723
Why don't we just go outside?

268
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:27,488
We'll grab some random
person off the street,

269
00:16:27,561 --> 00:16:28,493
drag them in here, you know...

270
00:16:28,562 --> 00:16:29,859
Sounds good to me.

271
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:32,729
Drag them in and cut them open.

272
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,462
Hey, whatever it takes, right?

273
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,969
You worry too much,
you know that?

274
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,528
Oh.

275
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:40,198
They'll find me one.

276
00:16:40,274 --> 00:16:44,005
It just takes a little time, that's all.

277
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:46,569
You're not going to like this.

278
00:16:48,115 --> 00:16:49,207
Straight to the king.

279
00:16:49,283 --> 00:16:52,775
Oh, nice hand!

280
00:16:52,853 --> 00:16:55,344
Boat. Jacks over eights.

281
00:16:55,423 --> 00:16:57,618
Are you kidding me? Again?

282
00:16:57,692 --> 00:16:58,716
Come on, you're my son.

283
00:16:58,793 --> 00:17:02,251
Can't hide anything
from your mother.

284
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,821
I think I need to go upstairs.

285
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,932
Don't stay up too late.

286
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,203
<i>Beresford Capital
opened higher today</i>

287
00:17:17,278 --> 00:17:21,214
<i>after their announcement of the Dirasonic
acquisition over the weekend.</i>

288
00:17:21,282 --> 00:17:23,273
<i>This bodes well for
the New York-based company,</i>

289
00:17:23,351 --> 00:17:25,717
<i>especially since continued merger
discussions</i>

290
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:29,381
<i>with the Shimotomo Corporation
have left investors feeling anxious.</i>

291
00:17:29,457 --> 00:17:32,324
<i>The Japanese government's investigation
into the Shimotomo family's</i>

292
00:17:32,393 --> 00:17:34,224
<i>alleged links to organized crime</i>

293
00:17:34,295 --> 00:17:36,195
<i>were well-documented last quarter.</i>

294
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,356
<i>And with that merger still in question,</i>

295
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:42,493
<i>the Dirasonic acquisition will go a great way
to calming investors' concerns</i>

296
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,902
<i>that Beresford is playing with fire.</i>

297
00:17:44,972 --> 00:17:46,769
<i>Still, rumors surrounding
the merger...</i>

298
00:17:46,841 --> 00:17:49,241
I thought you might like a little drink.

299
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,870
Oh, maybe one. Thank you.

300
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,379
You're up late.

301
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,005
Something on your mind?

302
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,551
Got to get my family time in now.

303
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,814
You know, before some
smoothy whisks you away.

304
00:18:00,888 --> 00:18:01,820
Yeah, right.

305
00:18:01,889 --> 00:18:03,015
Like that's going to happen.

306
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,115
I don't know.

307
00:18:05,192 --> 00:18:08,559
I think maybe somebody
had a little baby crush on Dr. Neyer.

308
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,722
I saw the way
you were looking at him.

309
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,789
I don't need anyone else.

310
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:15,597
I got you, Clay. Remember?

311
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:17,534
So, I closed Lambert today.

312
00:18:17,605 --> 00:18:19,232
That means if we get
a hold of Mecter too,

313
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,673
that's 2,000 new jobs guaranteed,
plus new housing...

314
00:18:22,743 --> 00:18:24,608
Do you remember him, Clay?

315
00:18:27,848 --> 00:18:29,145
I remember bits.

316
00:18:29,216 --> 00:18:30,240
Like what?

317
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,643
He died at Christmas.

318
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:36,485
Come on, don't you
remember anything else?

319
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:38,991
Sure, he was wearing a Santa suit,
and he fell down the stairs.

320
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,756
I mean from when he was alive, Clay.

321
00:18:44,698 --> 00:18:46,495
I remember he smiled a lot.

322
00:18:52,573 --> 00:18:54,700
Sorry to interrupt, Mrs. Beresford.

323
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:56,402
Uh, door was open.

324
00:18:56,477 --> 00:18:57,876
What?

325
00:18:57,945 --> 00:18:59,242
I just need your signature.

326
00:18:59,313 --> 00:19:02,248
I know it's late,
but I want to get this out tonight.

327
00:19:02,316 --> 00:19:04,284
Of course, Sam.
Thank you.

328
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,545
The Edmond "thank yous" are done,

329
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:06,711
your table's locked for the benefit,

330
00:19:06,787 --> 00:19:08,345
and I put you down for the roast beef.

331
00:19:08,422 --> 00:19:09,616
I know it's your favorite.

332
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,954
You're too good to me, Sam.

333
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:18,991
Well, if that will be all,
I... should be heading home.

334
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:21,000
- Good night, Mrs. Beresford.
- Night.

335
00:19:21,068 --> 00:19:22,365
Mr. Beresford.

336
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,377
Sam!

337
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,411
- Sam.
- I'm tired, all right?

338
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:43,684
I just want to go home.

339
00:19:43,757 --> 00:19:45,486
Actually, fuck it.

340
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,789
You got me hiding
my engagement ring, Clay.

341
00:19:47,862 --> 00:19:49,693
What is wrong with you?

342
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:50,957
- Will you come under the umbrella?
- No.

343
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:52,555
I've been engaged for six months.

344
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:55,602
No one even knows I'm dating anyone.

345
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:57,534
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

346
00:19:57,605 --> 00:19:58,594
I'm sorry.

347
00:19:58,672 --> 00:20:00,731
If you won't even acknowledge me,
how do l...

348
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:03,902
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?

349
00:20:03,978 --> 00:20:07,641
For Christ's sake, Clay,
what are you doing?

350
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:08,909
You can't be in the rain.

351
00:20:08,983 --> 00:20:11,645
Will you come inside
so we can get warm?

352
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,479
But she'll see.

353
00:20:20,394 --> 00:20:22,521
Are you sure?

354
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,928
Unless you'd rather stand in the rain.

355
00:20:28,335 --> 00:20:31,270
I should have done this
a long time ago.

356
00:20:32,673 --> 00:20:34,834
She's not going to like it.

357
00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:36,399
Come on.

358
00:20:39,547 --> 00:20:41,344
I trusted you in my home, Samantha.

359
00:20:41,415 --> 00:20:44,509
How could you come in here
and sneak around?

360
00:20:44,585 --> 00:20:45,517
Please.

361
00:20:45,586 --> 00:20:46,848
Clay, she lied to me to my face.

362
00:20:46,921 --> 00:20:49,151
- She's a liar.
- I can't stay here forever.

363
00:20:49,223 --> 00:20:51,851
I'm not asking you to.
Just... wait a bit.

364
00:20:51,926 --> 00:20:52,950
Get to know each other first.

365
00:20:53,027 --> 00:20:54,619
We've been together for a year.

366
00:20:54,695 --> 00:20:56,595
Then wait till you're a little older.

367
00:20:56,664 --> 00:20:58,393
How old were you
when you got married?

368
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,865
It's different. I was too young.

369
00:21:00,935 --> 00:21:03,426
Clay, you've got your
whole life ahead of you.

370
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:04,869
Do I?

371
00:21:09,843 --> 00:21:12,573
If you walk out that door,
you've made your choice.

372
00:21:13,914 --> 00:21:16,007
You're making it for me.

373
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,123
Sam, wait.

374
00:21:31,198 --> 00:21:32,756
Oh... oh, God.

375
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,599
Okay. Um...

376
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,002
Nope.

377
00:21:39,073 --> 00:21:40,370
Here we go.

378
00:21:40,441 --> 00:21:42,432
Look what we've got here.

379
00:21:43,877 --> 00:21:45,845
All right, sweetie.

380
00:21:45,913 --> 00:21:48,643
All right. Open up, honey.

381
00:21:48,716 --> 00:21:51,014
You okay?

382
00:21:51,085 --> 00:21:52,017
You okay?

383
00:21:52,086 --> 00:21:53,485
I am so sorry.

384
00:21:53,554 --> 00:21:55,749
I just needed to be acknowledged, that's all.

385
00:21:55,823 --> 00:21:57,882
I'm going to go away
and leave you two alone, okay?

386
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,119
Marry me.

387
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,661
What?

388
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:03,060
Tonight. Right now.

389
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,392
Marry me tonight.

390
00:22:04,465 --> 00:22:06,296
But it's the middle of the night.

391
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,631
I don't want to wait anymore.
We've waited long enough.

392
00:22:10,404 --> 00:22:12,804
Really?

393
00:22:17,444 --> 00:22:19,708
The minister is on his way,

394
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,147
and he's bringing
his wife as a witness.

395
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:25,617
How the hell did you
pull that one off?

396
00:22:25,686 --> 00:22:27,881
Triple bypass last June.

397
00:22:27,955 --> 00:22:29,547
I'm calling in a favor.

398
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,518
You're a good best man, Jack.

399
00:22:33,594 --> 00:22:35,027
- Thank you.
- Okay, hold on.

400
00:22:35,095 --> 00:22:37,029
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no.

401
00:22:37,097 --> 00:22:38,860
- Come on, please! Please, please, please.
- We had this conversation.

402
00:22:38,932 --> 00:22:41,093
Clay, I am pulling
80 hours a week, man.

403
00:22:41,168 --> 00:22:43,534
I've gotta drag these
little moments out any way I can.

404
00:22:43,604 --> 00:22:45,504
Just... Just one, okay?

405
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,267
You gotta take the lens cap off first.

406
00:22:47,341 --> 00:22:50,310
Oh, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

407
00:22:50,377 --> 00:22:52,709
Just one, just one.

408
00:22:53,814 --> 00:22:55,907
Oh, man, look at that.

409
00:22:55,983 --> 00:22:57,712
An actual smile.

410
00:23:02,022 --> 00:23:03,887
So proud of you.

411
00:23:03,957 --> 00:23:07,188
I, Samantha Jane Lockwood...

412
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:08,990
I, Samantha Jane Lockwood...

413
00:23:09,063 --> 00:23:11,827
take you, Clayton Beresford, Jr...

414
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:14,424
take you, Clayton Beresford, Jr...

415
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:17,299
to be my lawful wedded husband...

416
00:23:17,371 --> 00:23:19,737
to be my lawful wedded husband...

417
00:23:19,807 --> 00:23:22,002
to have and to hold...

418
00:23:22,076 --> 00:23:24,067
to have and to hold...

419
00:23:24,144 --> 00:23:26,408
from this night forward...

420
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,243
from this night forward...

421
00:23:28,315 --> 00:23:30,715
for better, for worse...

422
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,581
for better, for worse...

423
00:23:32,653 --> 00:23:35,213
for richer, for poorer...

424
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,587
for richer, for poorer...

425
00:23:37,658 --> 00:23:40,718
in sickness and in health...

426
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,592
in sickness and in health...

427
00:23:43,664 --> 00:23:47,896
till death do us part.

428
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,368
till death do us part.

429
00:24:09,923 --> 00:24:12,687
Clay.

430
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,784
Clay, whoa!

431
00:24:13,861 --> 00:24:15,260
Whoa!

432
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,387
What are you doing?

433
00:24:16,463 --> 00:24:18,226
What do you think I'm doing?

434
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,427
What is...

435
00:24:24,271 --> 00:24:26,796
Clay.

436
00:24:28,108 --> 00:24:29,507
Clay.

437
00:24:31,478 --> 00:24:33,378
They're the only ones with the number.

438
00:24:33,447 --> 00:24:35,438
Holy shit.

439
00:24:39,386 --> 00:24:40,375
I love you.

440
00:24:40,454 --> 00:24:42,149
I love you, too.

441
00:24:43,957 --> 00:24:44,946
Here.

442
00:24:57,104 --> 00:24:58,799
There he is.

443
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,339
The man of the hour.

444
00:25:00,407 --> 00:25:02,432
Now, what took you two so long?

445
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:04,067
Sam, this is Dr. Puttnam.

446
00:25:04,144 --> 00:25:05,441
- Hello.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

447
00:25:05,512 --> 00:25:06,444
I've heard a lot about you.

448
00:25:06,513 --> 00:25:07,878
Clay's a lucky man.

449
00:25:07,948 --> 00:25:08,937
I am.

450
00:25:10,184 --> 00:25:12,846
Shit. I'm sorry. Sorry.

451
00:25:14,254 --> 00:25:16,017
You'll have to excuse Penny.

452
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:17,647
She's not from around here.

453
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,885
You walk on the other side
of the road over there, huh, Penny.

454
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,053
Very funny.

455
00:25:22,129 --> 00:25:23,153
Sorry I'm late.

456
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,255
Had a hard time getting a sitter.

457
00:25:25,332 --> 00:25:27,197
Penny Carver. Nice to meet you.

458
00:25:27,267 --> 00:25:29,098
Nice to meet you, too.
Sorry about him.

459
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:31,194
Oh, it's all right.
We're used to it by now.

460
00:25:31,271 --> 00:25:34,399
So, D.C., gunshot to the head,

461
00:25:34,475 --> 00:25:36,739
O-negative, perfect crossmatch.

462
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,710
Heart will be here in two hours.

463
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:40,610
And your mother's here.

464
00:25:40,681 --> 00:25:41,648
What?

465
00:25:41,715 --> 00:25:43,376
- Wait, she's here?
- Mm-hmm.

466
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,383
What? She's on the call sheet.

467
00:25:49,523 --> 00:25:51,582
You certainly took your time.

468
00:25:51,658 --> 00:25:54,024
Dr. Neyer's performing
this transplant across town.

469
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,288
Would you please clear it
with administration?

470
00:25:55,362 --> 00:25:57,057
Actually, I'm staying right here.

471
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,825
What?

472
00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:00,833
- Hello, Jonathan.
- Jack.

473
00:26:00,901 --> 00:26:02,232
You two know each other?

474
00:26:02,302 --> 00:26:03,769
Of course.

475
00:26:03,837 --> 00:26:04,895
Dr. Jack Harper,

476
00:26:04,972 --> 00:26:07,964
Head of Cardio
Varick University Medical.

477
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:12,000
Two mortgages, two ulcers,
two ex-wives.

478
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,411
You sound like my ex-wives.

479
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:16,676
You still fishing
in the East River, Jack?

480
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,843
Well, some of us
just don't have the time

481
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:21,251
to make it to the North Shore
every weekend.

482
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:24,222
Clay, this man has three malpractice suits
against him.

483
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,088
Three. I checked.

484
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,059
Four. l...

485
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,187
I think it's four, right, Jack?

486
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,595
You think this is funny?

487
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:39,928
Clayton, this time next year
I'll be Surgeon General.

488
00:26:40,007 --> 00:26:42,703
I write textbooks on this procedure.

489
00:26:44,578 --> 00:26:45,772
Really?

490
00:26:45,846 --> 00:26:47,575
That's... That's great.

491
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:49,513
I, uh...

492
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:51,175
I sure hope you've read them, Jack.

493
00:26:51,251 --> 00:26:53,481
Will you excuse us for a minute?

494
00:26:56,857 --> 00:26:59,121
Look at me. Look at me.

495
00:26:59,192 --> 00:27:01,183
This isn't about her.

496
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:05,630
I'm not risking your life
on some second-rate doctor.

497
00:27:05,699 --> 00:27:06,791
He's my friend, Mother.

498
00:27:06,867 --> 00:27:08,835
I trust him.

499
00:27:08,902 --> 00:27:11,530
I really wish you'd start trusting me.

500
00:27:11,605 --> 00:27:13,163
I'm sorry, darling.

501
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,639
The answer is no.

502
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:17,370
I wasn't asking for your permission.

503
00:27:29,723 --> 00:27:32,988
All right, I'm going to leave you guys
for a minute, okay?

504
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,857
Thanks, Jack.

505
00:27:40,133 --> 00:27:41,691
Looks nice.

506
00:27:41,768 --> 00:27:42,996
Does it fit?

507
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,971
Yeah. It's perfect.

508
00:27:47,507 --> 00:27:49,441
Quite a night we're having, huh?

509
00:27:51,244 --> 00:27:52,871
I'm scared shitless.

510
00:27:52,946 --> 00:27:55,107
I know. Me, too.

511
00:27:55,182 --> 00:27:57,047
But, hey, you know what?

512
00:27:57,117 --> 00:27:59,642
As soon as you get out of here,

513
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,712
we're going to start from scratch.

514
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:04,450
Get a little house on the beach.

515
00:28:04,524 --> 00:28:06,958
- Mm-hmm.
- Do it right, you know?

516
00:28:07,027 --> 00:28:07,959
Chase seagulls.

517
00:28:08,028 --> 00:28:10,121
What do you say?

518
00:28:11,932 --> 00:28:15,766
As soon as you get out,
I'll be right here.

519
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:21,537
You think my new heart will love you
as much as my old one?

520
00:28:30,817 --> 00:28:32,148
Okay, lovebirds.

521
00:28:32,219 --> 00:28:34,119
We gotta go.

522
00:28:34,187 --> 00:28:36,917
All right.

523
00:28:38,692 --> 00:28:42,128
I'll see you soon... wife.

524
00:28:43,397 --> 00:28:44,989
Say that again.

525
00:28:45,065 --> 00:28:47,590
Wife!

526
00:29:15,262 --> 00:29:19,096
Sometimes you have to hold the button down
for a while to get it to work.

527
00:29:23,103 --> 00:29:25,128
I don't need your help.

528
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,775
Guys, I'm Dr. Lupin.

529
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,841
Uh, you can call me Larry.

530
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:42,184
I'd shake hands,
but, uh, heh, you know.

531
00:29:42,255 --> 00:29:44,655
- Who is this? What's going on?
- I don't know.

532
00:29:44,725 --> 00:29:47,159
Your colleague,
Fitzpatrick, got laryngitis.

533
00:29:47,227 --> 00:29:48,956
They called me up
from Saint Mathew's.

534
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:51,088
I thought Fitzpatrick
was going to be here.

535
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,632
Yes, me, too, but we have Larry now.

536
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,431
The players may have changed,
but the game is still the same.

537
00:29:58,872 --> 00:30:01,204
We've been, um,
together a long time.

538
00:30:01,274 --> 00:30:02,571
Sort of like a little family.

539
00:30:02,642 --> 00:30:04,234
This is Dr. Puttnam.

540
00:30:04,311 --> 00:30:06,074
I understand.

541
00:30:06,146 --> 00:30:07,374
It's a pleasure, Doctor.

542
00:30:07,447 --> 00:30:08,709
How's the patient feeling?

543
00:30:08,782 --> 00:30:10,249
Okay.

544
00:30:10,317 --> 00:30:11,841
Everything all right?

545
00:30:11,918 --> 00:30:13,647
Just fine, Clay.

546
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,745
Hey, Penny.

547
00:30:15,822 --> 00:30:17,813
I'll see you in a few hours, okay?

548
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:20,458
All right.

549
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,653
Okay, Clay.

550
00:30:21,728 --> 00:30:23,628
This is it.

551
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:24,925
Mm-hmm.

552
00:30:24,998 --> 00:30:27,330
You just relax, all right?

553
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,767
The next time you see me,
this is all going to be over.

554
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:33,499
See you soon.

555
00:30:37,344 --> 00:30:39,904
Be gentle with him, okay?

556
00:30:42,249 --> 00:30:45,446
Okay, just gonna give you
a little oxygen here.

557
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:47,419
They already asked you
if you had anything

558
00:30:47,487 --> 00:30:49,045
to eat or drink in the last four hours?

559
00:30:49,122 --> 00:30:50,851
Yeah.

560
00:30:50,924 --> 00:30:52,983
And you've had general anesthetic before?

561
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,048
Mm-hmm.

562
00:30:54,127 --> 00:30:55,651
Good.

563
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:58,596
I read your pre-op assessment

564
00:30:58,665 --> 00:31:02,192
and came up with a nice
little cocktail.

565
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:05,102
A little abduction agent.
You're going to like this.

566
00:31:08,975 --> 00:31:10,567
Hang on tight.

567
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:14,703
Oh, my God.

568
00:31:14,781 --> 00:31:17,511
Yeah. That's Him all right.

569
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:21,247
Go ahead and count back
from ten for me, will you?

570
00:31:21,321 --> 00:31:22,288
Ten...

571
00:31:24,024 --> 00:31:28,586
nine, eight,

572
00:31:28,662 --> 00:31:30,254
seven...

573
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:34,122
si...

574
00:31:40,207 --> 00:31:42,505
Happy trails, my friend.

575
00:31:51,051 --> 00:31:52,609
<i>All right.</i>

576
00:31:52,686 --> 00:31:54,745
<i>Just let yourself go.</i>

577
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:56,288
<i>making love to me all morning.</i>

578
00:31:56,356 --> 00:31:58,950
<i>Just let yourself drift away.</i>

579
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,554
<i>Off you go.</i>

580
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:06,456
<i>Okay.</i>

581
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:07,465
Let's get going.

582
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:09,229
<i>I'm ready.</i>

583
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,964
<i>Let's do it.</i>

584
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:13,630
Hey, Larry, what did you use here?

585
00:32:13,707 --> 00:32:16,073
Midazolam? Fentanyl? Hmm?

586
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,337
Yeah, with a little
pancuronium chaser.

587
00:32:18,411 --> 00:32:20,242
<i>God, I wonder
what the scar's going to look like.</i>

588
00:32:22,749 --> 00:32:25,582
<i>Ah!</i>

589
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,086
<i>Don't you guys use shaving cream?</i>

590
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:33,122
<i>Ooh, that's freezing.</i>

591
00:32:34,928 --> 00:32:38,056
<i>What is that? That stinks.</i>

592
00:32:38,131 --> 00:32:42,033
<i>God, aren't I supposed
to be out for all this?</i>

593
00:32:42,102 --> 00:32:44,536
<i>How long does it take
for this stuff to work anyway?</i>

594
00:32:44,604 --> 00:32:46,003
How does he look, Larry?

595
00:32:46,072 --> 00:32:47,437
Everything okay?

596
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,600
Sleeping like a baby.

597
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,337
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

598
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:52,776
Is he good to go?

599
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:53,778
Jack...

600
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:54,779
You ready?

601
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:56,247
Ready as I'll ever be.

602
00:32:56,316 --> 00:33:00,013
<i>Wait. Am I supposed
to be asleep right now?</i>

603
00:33:00,086 --> 00:33:02,680
All right, let's get the drapes on.

604
00:33:02,756 --> 00:33:03,780
<i>Hold on.</i>

605
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:09,327
<i>Guys, l...
I can still hear you.</i>

606
00:33:09,396 --> 00:33:11,990
<i>Am I supposed to be able
to still hear you?</i>

607
00:33:15,268 --> 00:33:16,895
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait. Something's wrong.</i>

608
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,232
Give me another drape right here.

609
00:33:18,305 --> 00:33:19,363
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

610
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:21,464
<i>Something's definitely wrong, Jack.</i>

611
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,066
<i>Listen to me. I can feel that.</i>

612
00:33:24,144 --> 00:33:26,704
<i>I can still hear you.</i>

613
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,476
<i>Okay? I'm... I'm still awake!</i>

614
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,414
<i>Just stop.</i>

615
00:33:31,484 --> 00:33:33,918
<i>Aw, come on. Look at the machines.</i>

616
00:33:33,987 --> 00:33:35,045
<i>All right? I'm not under yet.</i>

617
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:36,281
<i>Look at the fucking monitors!</i>

618
00:33:36,356 --> 00:33:38,017
We're okay to go?

619
00:33:38,091 --> 00:33:40,025
<i>Jesus, this isn't fucking happening!</i>

620
00:33:40,093 --> 00:33:41,082
Scalpel.

621
00:33:41,161 --> 00:33:42,924
<i>Move something! Do something, Clay!</i>

622
00:33:42,996 --> 00:33:44,964
<i>Move... Move an arm,
move a finger!</i>

623
00:33:45,031 --> 00:33:47,397
<i>Come on, open your eyes!</i>

624
00:33:47,467 --> 00:33:52,734
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

625
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,909
Do we have blood in the room?

626
00:33:58,979 --> 00:34:01,971
Yes. We have four units.

627
00:34:02,048 --> 00:34:03,538
We gotta get
this thing sharpened.

628
00:34:03,616 --> 00:34:05,550
<i>Jack! Please! Oh, God!</i>

629
00:34:05,618 --> 00:34:07,745
Having a hard time getting through.

630
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:10,051
<i>Come on! Come on, Clay.</i>

631
00:34:10,123 --> 00:34:11,886
Saw.

632
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:13,016
<i>You're gonna...
You're gonna be okay.</i>

633
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:15,323
<i>- One, two...
- Just... hold on.</i>

634
00:34:15,395 --> 00:34:17,693
<i>- Everything's going to be... okay.
...three.</i>

635
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:21,894
<i>Ah! It's just pain.</i>

636
00:34:21,968 --> 00:34:23,526
<i>It's just pain.</i>

637
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,230
<i>It doesn't hurt.</i>

638
00:34:25,305 --> 00:34:26,704
<i>It doesn't fucking hurt!</i>

639
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,707
<i>Come on, Clay, focus!</i>

640
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,174
<i>Get the fuck out of this fucking room</i>

641
00:34:30,243 --> 00:34:31,267
<i>and think about
something else, okay?</i>

642
00:34:31,344 --> 00:34:32,276
<i>Anything.</i>

643
00:34:32,345 --> 00:34:34,370
<i>Just... think about Sam, okay?</i>

644
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,108
<i>Just get back to Sam.</i>

645
00:34:36,182 --> 00:34:39,049
<i>Just... Sam, help me!</i>

646
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,780
Ready?

647
00:34:40,854 --> 00:34:42,719
<i>- That's it!
- Come on.</i>

648
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,051
That's it. Just focus on her.

649
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:46,183
<i>Just focus on her.</i>

650
00:34:46,259 --> 00:34:47,920
<i>Just forget about the pain.</i>

651
00:34:47,994 --> 00:34:49,552
<i>Okay, Puttnam, take it. You got it.</i>

652
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,756
<i>Clay, just remember.</i>

653
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:55,028
<i>Remember everything.
Every detail.</i>

654
00:34:55,101 --> 00:34:57,035
Wow! Hey!

655
00:34:57,103 --> 00:34:58,263
<i>That's right. That's it.</i>

656
00:34:58,338 --> 00:34:59,532
The place used to be a speakeasy.

657
00:34:59,606 --> 00:35:00,834
No, you didn't...

658
00:35:00,907 --> 00:35:02,067
<i>Just focus.</i>

659
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:04,110
<i>Focus on her.</i>

660
00:35:04,177 --> 00:35:05,303
<i>No. No, no, no, no.</i>

661
00:35:05,378 --> 00:35:07,846
<i>What?</i>

662
00:35:07,914 --> 00:35:09,472
<i>What? No.</i>

663
00:35:09,549 --> 00:35:10,811
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

664
00:35:10,884 --> 00:35:14,445
- of the Lord to lay
Clayton Beresford to rest.

665
00:35:14,521 --> 00:35:16,113
<i>Come on, Clay, concentrate!</i>

666
00:35:16,189 --> 00:35:17,486
<i>Remember something else.</i>

667
00:35:17,557 --> 00:35:18,489
<i>Clayton?</i>

668
00:35:18,558 --> 00:35:20,526
- and a loving father.

669
00:35:20,593 --> 00:35:22,254
Clayton?

670
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,989
Clayton, are you paying attention?

671
00:35:24,064 --> 00:35:26,396
If it is made manifest by the third...

672
00:35:26,466 --> 00:35:27,558
<i>No! No, no, no, no!</i>

673
00:35:27,634 --> 00:35:28,566
<i>Forget about them, all right?</i>

674
00:35:28,635 --> 00:35:29,932
<i>They can't help you now.</i>

675
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,130
<i>To the newest hot shot on the Street,</i>

676
00:35:32,205 --> 00:35:33,763
<i>his father's son...</i>

677
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,829
<i>No, Clay! Fuck!</i>

678
00:35:34,908 --> 00:35:36,170
<i>Get back to Sam.</i>

679
00:35:36,242 --> 00:35:38,767
Okay, we have a massive
heart attack, possible M. I.

680
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,472
<i>Come on, Jack. Get me back to Sam.</i>

681
00:35:40,547 --> 00:35:41,479
What's his name?

682
00:35:41,548 --> 00:35:43,482
<i>I need your help.</i>

683
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:46,018
Stay with my voice, pal.

684
00:35:46,086 --> 00:35:48,020
You're gonna be fine, okay?

685
00:35:48,088 --> 00:35:49,453
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

686
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,422
<i>What the fuck?</i>

687
00:35:51,491 --> 00:35:53,652
Okay, open him up nice and wide.

688
00:35:53,726 --> 00:35:55,216
<i>Okay, it's happening again.</i>

689
00:35:55,295 --> 00:35:56,227
<i>Okay, it's fine.</i>

690
00:35:56,296 --> 00:35:57,285
<i>Just control it like before.</i>

691
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,591
<i>You can do this.</i>

692
00:35:58,665 --> 00:36:00,690
<i>Here we go, here we go,
here we go, here we go.</i>

693
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:02,200
<i>Come on, man, just swallow it.</i>

694
00:36:04,971 --> 00:36:06,370
Hey, follow my voice, pal.

695
00:36:06,439 --> 00:36:09,169
We got you.
Stay right with me, okay?

696
00:36:11,911 --> 00:36:13,139
There goes a rib.

697
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,374
Oh, that's going to hurt tomorrow.

698
00:36:15,448 --> 00:36:17,279
<i>Sorry, Clay.</i>

699
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,318
<i>Yeah, you better be fucking sorry.</i>

700
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,012
<i>Fucking asshole.</i>

701
00:36:21,087 --> 00:36:22,019
<i>Okay, it's over.</i>

702
00:36:22,088 --> 00:36:23,282
<i>They're... They're through.</i>

703
00:36:23,356 --> 00:36:25,187
<i>They're all the way in now.</i>

704
00:36:25,258 --> 00:36:26,850
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>

705
00:36:26,926 --> 00:36:29,656
<i>Just relax. The worst is over.</i>

706
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,129
<i>Jack's got you.</i>

707
00:36:32,198 --> 00:36:33,961
<i>He... He's going to take care
of you, all right?</i>

708
00:36:34,033 --> 00:36:35,159
<i>Just like he always does.</i>

709
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:36,293
Have a seat.

710
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:38,530
<i>Let him help you, Clay.</i>

711
00:36:38,605 --> 00:36:40,368
...I kind of like to do
a follow-up with someone

712
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,634
after I've saved their life.

713
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:43,767
You don't feel grateful
or anything, do you?

714
00:36:43,843 --> 00:36:45,140
<i>Get me to Sam, Jack.</i>

715
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:47,008
We're going to need a transplant.

716
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,741
You tell me. You're the doctor.

717
00:36:48,815 --> 00:36:50,715
You do much fishing?

718
00:36:50,783 --> 00:36:52,148
What do you do as a billionaire?

719
00:36:52,218 --> 00:36:53,742
You just sit around and eat shrimp?

720
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,617
<i>- You always keep your cell on...
- There she is.</i>

721
00:36:55,688 --> 00:36:56,746
...and that would be it.

722
00:36:56,823 --> 00:36:58,085
<i>- Okay.
- Sound like fun?</i>

723
00:36:58,158 --> 00:37:00,023
<i>You did it, Clay. You're back.</i>

724
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,617
Oh, and that'd be Clay.

725
00:37:01,694 --> 00:37:03,423
<i>- Awful table manners, always late.
- Look at me.</i>

726
00:37:03,496 --> 00:37:06,021
<i>- You'll get used to it.
- Look at me.</i>

727
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,199
Oh! Holy shit, I'm sorry.

728
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,863
I...

729
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:15,706
This is embarrassing.

730
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,072
I thought you were
at your office...

731
00:37:17,143 --> 00:37:19,168
<i>- I need your help, Sam.
- I came in to, um...</i>

732
00:37:19,245 --> 00:37:21,338
<i>I need a place to hide, okay?</i>

733
00:37:21,414 --> 00:37:23,644
So, nice to meet you, too.

734
00:37:23,716 --> 00:37:25,183
My name's Sam.

735
00:37:25,251 --> 00:37:27,082
<i>There we go, Clay.</i>

736
00:37:27,153 --> 00:37:28,211
<i>You see?</i>

737
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:30,347
<i>Just let her take you away.</i>

738
00:37:30,423 --> 00:37:32,618
<i>Go all the way back to the beginning.</i>

739
00:37:32,692 --> 00:37:36,219
We are going to where
the other half lives.

740
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,054
Let me guess,

741
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,498
never been on the subway before.

742
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,703
No.

743
00:37:45,772 --> 00:37:47,763
Never been to Brooklyn, either?

744
00:37:49,342 --> 00:37:52,072
- To be perfectly honest, never.
- Wow.

745
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:56,241
Oh, you really shouldn't
be smoking these things.

746
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:59,479
<i>- I'll be with you soon, Sam.
- It's not good for you.</i>

747
00:37:59,552 --> 00:38:03,750
<i>No matter what happens,
I'll be with you soon.</i>

748
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:11,354
Miss, um... Ramos?

749
00:38:11,431 --> 00:38:14,332
We're ready for you. Room 5.

750
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,698
Right down the end of the hall,
on your right.

751
00:38:16,769 --> 00:38:18,669
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

752
00:38:25,745 --> 00:38:27,440
Hi. How are you doing?

753
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,502
Hey.

754
00:38:28,581 --> 00:38:30,640
Can I help you with something?

755
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,147
Haven't I... seen you around?

756
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:42,792
Guess not.

757
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,955
Sorry.

758
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:48,567
You have two rings on your finger.

759
00:38:48,635 --> 00:38:50,364
What was that?

760
00:38:50,436 --> 00:38:54,202
Why are you wearing two rings, Sam?

761
00:38:57,844 --> 00:38:59,709
When?

762
00:38:59,779 --> 00:39:02,339
Just before he got the call.

763
00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:07,008
Lilith...

764
00:39:13,259 --> 00:39:15,819
Who needs all
those extra nurses, anyway, huh?

765
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,385
Well, I'm sick of the cutbacks.

766
00:39:17,463 --> 00:39:19,693
I mean, how can they ask us
to do this with five people?

767
00:39:19,766 --> 00:39:21,734
Yeah. You want to clamp that?

768
00:39:23,503 --> 00:39:24,868
Ah, that's good Miss Chen.

769
00:39:24,937 --> 00:39:26,097
Heart came early.

770
00:39:26,172 --> 00:39:28,697
Yeah, there she is.

771
00:39:28,775 --> 00:39:30,299
Thanks, Penny.

772
00:39:30,376 --> 00:39:31,604
Clear.

773
00:39:31,678 --> 00:39:34,146
Look at her. She's a beauty.

774
00:39:34,213 --> 00:39:35,680
He's a lucky man.

775
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,648
Oh, by the way,
I've got two tickets

776
00:39:37,717 --> 00:39:40,413
to the Knicks,
third row, tonight, Penny.

777
00:39:40,486 --> 00:39:41,976
- Any interest?
- No, thanks.

778
00:39:42,055 --> 00:39:43,989
What, is it
too American for you?

779
00:39:44,057 --> 00:39:46,719
<i>We're halfway home, Sam.</i>

780
00:39:47,727 --> 00:39:48,785
See where you live?

781
00:39:48,861 --> 00:39:50,385
<i>The new heart's already here.</i>

782
00:39:50,463 --> 00:39:52,454
That's you. Right there.

783
00:39:52,532 --> 00:39:54,329
<i>They're gonna put it in soon.</i>

784
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,493
Not that far away from
each other after all,

785
00:39:56,569 --> 00:39:58,503
are we Clay?

786
00:39:58,571 --> 00:40:02,098
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

787
00:40:02,175 --> 00:40:06,271
<i>God, I miss you.</i>

788
00:40:06,346 --> 00:40:08,576
Stay with me.

789
00:40:10,049 --> 00:40:12,677
Just stay.

790
00:40:12,752 --> 00:40:15,744
<i>We're almost there, Sam.</i>

791
00:40:15,822 --> 00:40:18,814
<i>We're almost there.</i>

792
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,592
How are we doin', Penny?

793
00:40:21,661 --> 00:40:23,959
He's looking good. He's stable.

794
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,622
What about you, Jack?
You wanna go to the Knicks tonight?

795
00:40:25,698 --> 00:40:27,325
It might be good for you
to take the edge off.

796
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,368
I hate the Knicks.

797
00:40:29,435 --> 00:40:30,834
Jesus, what is wrong
with you people?

798
00:40:30,903 --> 00:40:32,131
I got third row.

799
00:40:33,172 --> 00:40:35,072
Oh, shit.

800
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:43,309
Levatol, Nalapril, Digoxin.

801
00:40:45,251 --> 00:40:47,515
He likes me to carry them around.

802
00:40:47,587 --> 00:40:50,681
If I left it up to him,
he'd be popping 'em like M&Ms.

803
00:40:50,757 --> 00:40:53,157
He could OD on
these things, you know?

804
00:40:53,226 --> 00:40:55,057
Can't say I'll miss them.

805
00:40:55,128 --> 00:40:59,155
A lot of cute purses I haven't
been able to use over the last year.

806
00:41:02,268 --> 00:41:04,327
I didn't know you did that,

807
00:41:04,404 --> 00:41:07,771
that you carried his meds around.

808
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,976
I tried not to like him.

809
00:41:15,047 --> 00:41:18,676
I honestly did.

810
00:41:18,751 --> 00:41:21,618
Lilith, I know
how much he means to you.

811
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,815
What do you want from me, Sam?

812
00:41:24,891 --> 00:41:29,294
I want you to tell him
that he's as good as his father.

813
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:33,992
I want you to tell him
that it's okay to love me,

814
00:41:34,066 --> 00:41:37,126
and I want you to tell me
that it's okay to love him back.

815
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:43,971
He's already lost one parent,
he can't lose another.

816
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,670
He needs you.

817
00:41:45,745 --> 00:41:49,203
I'm not a bad person.

818
00:41:49,282 --> 00:41:50,681
I mean, if you could
just give us your blessing...

819
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:55,244
Okay, just stop talking.

820
00:41:56,589 --> 00:42:00,184
Just make sure
he takes his meds and...

821
00:42:00,259 --> 00:42:02,159
stop talking.

822
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,162
What?

823
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,788
He has terrible allergies,
did you know that?

824
00:42:05,865 --> 00:42:07,457
Especially in the spring.

825
00:42:07,533 --> 00:42:10,969
Grass and flowers...

826
00:42:11,037 --> 00:42:13,665
Don't think this means
I'm going to be visiting every week.

827
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,175
Okay. Okay, let go.

828
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:22,180
All right.

829
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,842
Still sleeping like a baby.

830
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,351
Okay, why don't you
take your break, Larry?

831
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,479
We've been at this for a while.

832
00:42:29,555 --> 00:42:32,581
They've got a soda machine
in the waiting room.

833
00:42:32,658 --> 00:42:35,218
Really? 'Cause I do
have to make a call.

834
00:42:35,294 --> 00:42:37,455
Sure, go ahead,
you've got at least 20 minutes.

835
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:38,497
We don't need you for a while.

836
00:42:38,564 --> 00:42:39,496
Well, thanks, guys.

837
00:42:39,565 --> 00:42:40,497
Sure.

838
00:42:40,566 --> 00:42:41,658
Thanks a lot.

839
00:42:41,734 --> 00:42:43,998
Pickups. Need adrenaline.

840
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,298
Peanut.

841
00:42:45,371 --> 00:42:47,931
Hey, if you need somebody
to go with you tonight,

842
00:42:48,007 --> 00:42:50,805
to the game...

843
00:42:50,877 --> 00:42:52,708
Thanks, Larry.

844
00:43:02,021 --> 00:43:03,818
Jack?

845
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:06,358
What's the matter?
You all right?

846
00:43:08,828 --> 00:43:11,854
I don't know if I can do this.

847
00:43:11,931 --> 00:43:13,831
What is the problem?

848
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,992
Fitzpatrick is the problem.

849
00:43:15,067 --> 00:43:16,898
He screwed us.

850
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:19,529
This guy's been watching everything I do.

851
00:43:19,605 --> 00:43:21,334
Oh, come no, Jack. Larry's an idiot.

852
00:43:21,407 --> 00:43:22,874
He doesn't know
what's going on here.

853
00:43:22,942 --> 00:43:24,534
No, it's like he's
been sent here to spy on us.

854
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:26,942
I think they found out we've been pushing
Clay down the donor list.

855
00:43:27,013 --> 00:43:27,945
<i>What?</i>

856
00:43:28,014 --> 00:43:29,276
Did you smell his breath, Jack?

857
00:43:29,348 --> 00:43:30,679
He's not a spy, he's a drunk.

858
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,945
He's probably in there right now
in the bar topping himself...

859
00:43:33,019 --> 00:43:34,953
Hey, would you just be quiet?

860
00:43:35,021 --> 00:43:35,953
He could be back any second.

861
00:43:36,022 --> 00:43:37,353
Okay, then go stand guard.

862
00:43:37,423 --> 00:43:40,290
Go on. Now! And find out
what happened to Fitzpatrick...

863
00:43:41,694 --> 00:43:44,561
Hey, Jack, do not get paranoid.

864
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,564
No one knows.

865
00:43:46,632 --> 00:43:48,623
I started this thing,
and I swear to you I will end this.

866
00:43:48,701 --> 00:43:50,066
I am not going to jail.

867
00:43:50,136 --> 00:43:51,660
<i>Wait, wait, wait. What?</i>

868
00:43:51,737 --> 00:43:53,261
No one's going to jail.

869
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,967
Look, let's inject the heart, put it in,

870
00:43:56,042 --> 00:43:57,066
and end this thing, okay?

871
00:43:57,143 --> 00:43:58,508
<i>What the fuck?</i>

872
00:43:58,578 --> 00:43:59,806
Nobody's on to anything.

873
00:43:59,879 --> 00:44:01,506
We are in... the... clear.

874
00:44:01,581 --> 00:44:03,208
We're gonna kill this guy,

875
00:44:03,282 --> 00:44:05,250
and then we're gonna go get
a fucking martini, okay?

876
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:07,616
By the time Larry walks back in here,

877
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,655
he'll be toes up
on the slab downstairs.

878
00:44:09,722 --> 00:44:11,314
<i>You gotta be fucking kidding me.</i>

879
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:12,721
He knows something's going on.

880
00:44:12,792 --> 00:44:14,487
I just wanna be on bypass
before Larry gets back.

881
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,050
You get no arguments there.

882
00:44:16,128 --> 00:44:17,322
<i>You gotta stand up.</i>

883
00:44:17,396 --> 00:44:20,126
<i>You gotta stand up, Clay.</i>

884
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,827
<i>Take the tape off your eyes
and shit out of your throat,</i>

885
00:44:22,902 --> 00:44:24,028
<i>and wake up.</i>

886
00:44:24,103 --> 00:44:25,502
...is if we suddenly
stopped the procedure.

887
00:44:25,571 --> 00:44:27,402
<i>That's it, there you go.</i>

888
00:44:27,473 --> 00:44:28,940
<i>You can do it.</i>

889
00:44:29,008 --> 00:44:31,602
<i>Just open your eyes, Clay.</i>

890
00:44:31,677 --> 00:44:34,737
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

891
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:57,066
I'm not doing this by myself.

892
00:44:58,638 --> 00:45:00,572
I'm telling you,
if this thing goes sour,

893
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,733
if this guy looks like he's
figuring something out,

894
00:45:02,808 --> 00:45:05,470
I'm pulling the plug
on this whole thing so quickly.

895
00:45:05,544 --> 00:45:06,636
I'm not kidding, Eugene.

896
00:45:06,712 --> 00:45:08,270
Hey, will you help me
with these stitches, please?

897
00:45:09,682 --> 00:45:11,047
I'm too young to go to jail right now.

898
00:45:11,117 --> 00:45:12,880
This ain't even worth it.

899
00:45:12,952 --> 00:45:13,919
We're fine, Jack...

900
00:45:15,488 --> 00:45:16,682
<i>All right, now think.</i>

901
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:19,953
Do you know how many
bullshit malpractice lawsuits

902
00:45:20,026 --> 00:45:21,493
there are in this country?

903
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,527
<i>Think, Clay.</i>

904
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:23,823
Hard-working doctors, that's just...

905
00:45:23,896 --> 00:45:25,488
<i>Look closer.</i>

906
00:45:25,564 --> 00:45:27,156
You know how many I got?

907
00:45:27,233 --> 00:45:28,393
- Four.
- Yeah, I know.

908
00:45:28,467 --> 00:45:29,491
<i>There's gotta be a way out of this.</i>

909
00:45:29,568 --> 00:45:31,035
All for trying to
save people's lives.

910
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,570
It's a disgrace.

911
00:45:32,638 --> 00:45:34,970
<i>You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be all right.</i>

912
00:45:36,876 --> 00:45:38,844
<i>You're not gonna die.</i>

913
00:45:38,911 --> 00:45:41,573
I'm sorry.
They called me out of nowhere.

914
00:45:41,647 --> 00:45:44,275
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

915
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,750
Mm-hmm.

916
00:45:47,853 --> 00:45:51,118
You know what? I'm gonna try
and find out what's going on.

917
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:52,179
- Yeah.
- Okay?

918
00:45:52,258 --> 00:45:54,089
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

919
00:45:56,896 --> 00:45:58,921
Hi. Excuse me.

920
00:45:58,998 --> 00:46:00,727
I was wondering
if you knew the status

921
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,893
on the heart transplant patient?

922
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,095
Mr. Beresford?

923
00:46:05,171 --> 00:46:06,103
Yeah.

924
00:46:06,172 --> 00:46:07,764
I'll call you back.

925
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,831
He's doing just fine.

926
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:11,206
We're taking
good care of him. Don't worry.

927
00:46:11,277 --> 00:46:13,575
Everything's going according to plan.

928
00:46:15,014 --> 00:46:17,574
Really?
I just came from there.

929
00:46:19,418 --> 00:46:20,885
What is it?

930
00:46:20,953 --> 00:46:23,285
You're not a doctor at this hospital.

931
00:46:23,355 --> 00:46:27,655
I mean, you don't work here, do you?

932
00:46:27,727 --> 00:46:29,991
I'm Dr. Larry Lupin.
Pleasure to meet you.

933
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:33,289
Mr. Beresford's anesthesiologist.

934
00:46:34,467 --> 00:46:36,560
Will you excuse me a minute?

935
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:44,131
Fitzpatrick got laryngitis.
They called me in from St. Matthews.

936
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:45,734
Oh.

937
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:47,176
I thought Fitzpatrick
was gonna be here.

938
00:46:47,246 --> 00:46:50,079
Yes, me, too,
but we have Larry now.

939
00:46:50,149 --> 00:46:52,447
The players may have changed,
but the game is still the same.

940
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:55,954
God, look how fucking obvious.

941
00:46:57,056 --> 00:46:58,580
I understand.

942
00:46:58,657 --> 00:47:00,318
This is Dr. Puttnam.

943
00:47:00,392 --> 00:47:02,690
Pleasure. How's the patient doing?

944
00:47:02,762 --> 00:47:04,127
Okay.

945
00:47:05,564 --> 00:47:06,622
Everything all right?

946
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,860
I don't get it, Jack.

947
00:47:08,934 --> 00:47:11,767
Why?

948
00:47:18,811 --> 00:47:20,711
Is she asleep?

949
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:23,044
Oh, no, no. Everything's fine.

950
00:47:23,115 --> 00:47:25,140
Just, um, just give her a kiss for me,

951
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,912
and tell her I'll be home soon.

952
00:47:26,986 --> 00:47:29,250
Good. Thanks.

953
00:47:30,289 --> 00:47:31,415
Say that again.

954
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:32,422
Wife!

955
00:47:32,491 --> 00:47:35,255
What'd I ever do to you?

956
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:39,030
What did she do to you?

957
00:47:39,098 --> 00:47:41,430
Huh?

958
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,798
How the fuck
could you do this to us?

959
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:45,029
What are you doing in here?

960
00:47:45,104 --> 00:47:47,868
I wanted to see how it was going.

961
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:51,866
Sam.

962
00:47:52,978 --> 00:47:55,674
How's it going? Is everything okay?

963
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:56,840
Yeah.

964
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:59,817
Sam.

965
00:47:59,885 --> 00:48:01,250
They're trying to kill me.

966
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,289
I just had an interesting chat
with some guy named Larry.

967
00:48:04,356 --> 00:48:06,324
Everything's fine.
You shouldn't be in here.

968
00:48:06,392 --> 00:48:09,919
No, don't trust him, baby.

969
00:48:09,995 --> 00:48:11,462
He's lying to you.

970
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:12,929
Are you sure everything's fine?

971
00:48:12,998 --> 00:48:15,489
There is nothing wrong.
Everything's under control.

972
00:48:15,568 --> 00:48:17,092
Bullshit.

973
00:48:17,169 --> 00:48:18,466
What the hell's going on in here?

974
00:48:18,537 --> 00:48:19,970
That's right. Come on, baby.

975
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:21,973
Where the fuck is Fitzpatrick?

976
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:24,601
I just spoke to him.
He's at home.

977
00:48:24,677 --> 00:48:27,271
What do you mean, he's at home?

978
00:48:27,346 --> 00:48:28,836
- He's backing out.
- He's backing out?

979
00:48:28,914 --> 00:48:30,848
What?

980
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:31,848
He can't back out.

981
00:48:31,917 --> 00:48:33,441
Do you want me to call him back?

982
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:35,077
No, he's an idiot.

983
00:48:35,154 --> 00:48:37,850
We'll deal with him later.

984
00:48:37,923 --> 00:48:40,448
What about this Larry guy?
Does he have a clue?

985
00:48:40,526 --> 00:48:42,391
None. What about her?

986
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,655
Are you kidding?

987
00:48:43,729 --> 00:48:45,754
She's ready to adopt me.
Everything's fine.

988
00:48:50,703 --> 00:48:52,830
Everything is fine, right?

989
00:48:52,905 --> 00:48:56,033
Right?

990
00:48:57,443 --> 00:49:01,209
Jack, you okay?

991
00:49:02,748 --> 00:49:05,444
Jack?

992
00:49:07,386 --> 00:49:08,318
Get her a gown.

993
00:49:08,387 --> 00:49:09,615
What about Larry?

994
00:49:09,688 --> 00:49:12,282
I'll watch for him. Just hurry.

995
00:49:16,695 --> 00:49:18,663
Guys, finish putting him on bypass.

996
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,829
Jack.

997
00:49:28,908 --> 00:49:32,810
It was my idea, Sam. You know?

998
00:49:32,878 --> 00:49:34,812
Jesus.

999
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,940
I can pull the plug if I want to.

1000
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:40,884
Everything is working, Jack.

1001
00:49:40,953 --> 00:49:42,580
Okay?

1002
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,713
There he is.

1003
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:46,280
- I got him to marry me.
- The man of the hour.

1004
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,848
The hard part's over.

1005
00:49:47,927 --> 00:49:50,088
This is Dr. Puttnam. Sam.

1006
00:49:50,162 --> 00:49:51,595
Sam, I've heard a lot about you.

1007
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:54,856
<i>Christ, they know her.</i>

1008
00:49:54,934 --> 00:49:57,562
Sorry, I'm late.
I had a hard time getting a sitter.

1009
00:49:57,636 --> 00:49:59,467
Penny Carver.
Pleasure to meet you.

1010
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,130
Nice to meet you, too.

1011
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,969
Sorry about him.

1012
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:04,441
I'm used to it by now.

1013
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:06,307
So...

1014
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:09,905
How the hell do they all know her?

1015
00:50:09,982 --> 00:50:12,212
We didn't waste a year of our lives

1016
00:50:12,284 --> 00:50:15,151
for nothing, did we, Jack?

1017
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,653
Nobody knows I worked your team.

1018
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:17,689
<i>What?</i>

1019
00:50:17,756 --> 00:50:19,553
I changed my name.

1020
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:22,185
We're clear.
We're totally in the clear.

1021
00:50:22,261 --> 00:50:24,661
Yeah, they're all mine.

1022
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:29,258
Kind of depressing to know that
your whole life can just fit on one wall.

1023
00:50:29,335 --> 00:50:31,166
My dream is to one
day fill up this one.

1024
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:34,171
Jack, you know how much
we owe from the lawsuits.

1025
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,140
The insurance won't cover it.

1026
00:50:37,209 --> 00:50:40,076
I can't just kill him, Sam.

1027
00:50:40,145 --> 00:50:43,046
This is our only way out.

1028
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:48,481
Without this money, we're finished.

1029
00:50:48,554 --> 00:50:51,250
He has to die.

1030
00:50:51,323 --> 00:50:53,553
I am fucked.

1031
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:55,183
It's just money, Sam.

1032
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,093
I'd rather stay in debt than go to jail.

1033
00:50:58,163 --> 00:50:59,130
Jesus, Jack.

1034
00:50:59,198 --> 00:51:01,291
Grow some fucking balls.

1035
00:51:01,367 --> 00:51:03,927
Hey, I started this
whole thing, remember?

1036
00:51:04,003 --> 00:51:06,733
He landed on my table, I brought you in,

1037
00:51:06,805 --> 00:51:08,238
I brought all y'all in.

1038
00:51:08,307 --> 00:51:11,470
It's my choice.

1039
00:51:11,543 --> 00:51:14,478
And I wasn't the one that nearly
screwed this whole thing up, was I?

1040
00:51:14,546 --> 00:51:15,672
He's right, you know.

1041
00:51:15,748 --> 00:51:17,613
I would've had that ring on my finger

1042
00:51:17,683 --> 00:51:18,615
in two months.

1043
00:51:18,684 --> 00:51:20,083
Really?

1044
00:51:20,152 --> 00:51:21,346
Well, if you hadn't got knocked up,

1045
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,684
maybe you would've had
the chance, wouldn't you?

1046
00:51:23,756 --> 00:51:26,452
Just go, Penny, all right?

1047
00:51:29,361 --> 00:51:32,762
Jack, think about it.

1048
00:51:32,831 --> 00:51:37,825
No more triple shifts.

1049
00:51:37,903 --> 00:51:40,929
No more 30-hour days.

1050
00:51:41,006 --> 00:51:45,238
Even if we settle the will, we're rich.

1051
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:48,939
You know what
100 million is four ways?

1052
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:54,783
He's a transplant patient, Jack.

1053
00:51:54,853 --> 00:51:57,287
They all die eventually.

1054
00:51:57,356 --> 00:52:00,757
Yeah.

1055
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:03,260
They all die eventually.

1056
00:52:11,703 --> 00:52:13,330
Look at me.

1057
00:52:13,405 --> 00:52:15,270
This isn't about her.

1058
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,103
I'm so sorry.

1059
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:20,043
I'm not risking your life
on some second-rate doctor.

1060
00:52:20,112 --> 00:52:22,808
He's my friend, Mother. I trust him.

1061
00:52:22,881 --> 00:52:25,543
I really wish
you'd start trusting me.

1062
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:29,245
Quickly. Watch the vein.

1063
00:52:29,321 --> 00:52:31,755
All right, it's almost there.

1064
00:52:31,824 --> 00:52:33,849
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

1065
00:52:37,729 --> 00:52:39,321
I got it.

1066
00:52:39,398 --> 00:52:40,763
All right, I need some suction.

1067
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:43,301
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Please, God, no.

1068
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:46,166
- Just get that side, too.
- Okay.

1069
00:52:46,238 --> 00:52:48,069
Oh, no, please, God.

1070
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,937
No.

1071
00:52:50,943 --> 00:52:54,572
Aah!

1072
00:52:54,646 --> 00:52:56,341
It's right here.

1073
00:52:56,415 --> 00:52:58,007
Thank you.

1074
00:52:59,184 --> 00:53:00,708
You sure Larry's not close?

1075
00:53:00,786 --> 00:53:02,151
We're fine. Don't worry.

1076
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:03,518
We gotta hurry all the same, okay, Jack?

1077
00:53:03,589 --> 00:53:05,056
Let's just keep it moving.

1078
00:53:05,124 --> 00:53:07,388
All right, just pass over the new heart.

1079
00:53:07,459 --> 00:53:08,391
What?

1080
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:09,688
Pass over the new heart.

1081
00:53:09,761 --> 00:53:11,388
But we haven't injected it yet.

1082
00:53:11,463 --> 00:53:13,954
Pass it over.

1083
00:53:14,032 --> 00:53:16,057
What are you doing?

1084
00:53:16,135 --> 00:53:18,194
Where's the syringe?

1085
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:19,430
Give it to me.

1086
00:53:19,505 --> 00:53:20,699
Come on.

1087
00:53:20,772 --> 00:53:23,332
Move your fucking hand.

1088
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:27,174
Now, I want you to take this.

1089
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:32,850
Inject the heart,
and put it in the body, okay?

1090
00:53:36,355 --> 00:53:38,653
You led us here.

1091
00:53:38,724 --> 00:53:41,192
Finish what you started.

1092
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,160
Just do it, Jack.

1093
00:53:43,228 --> 00:53:45,162
Let's get this over with.

1094
00:53:47,466 --> 00:53:50,196
Sorry, baby.

1095
00:53:52,804 --> 00:53:54,431
He really loved you, Sam.

1096
00:53:54,506 --> 00:53:57,771
He didn't even know me, Jack.

1097
00:53:57,843 --> 00:53:59,868
We never even met.

1098
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:09,913
Wait. Hold on.

1099
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:14,956
Holy shit.

1100
00:54:15,027 --> 00:54:17,996
Oh, holy shit.

1101
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:41,449
Is he okay?

1102
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,784
Is everything okay?

1103
00:54:43,855 --> 00:54:45,982
They wouldn't say.

1104
00:54:46,058 --> 00:54:47,616
You were gone so long.

1105
00:54:47,693 --> 00:54:48,625
- I know.
- I started...

1106
00:54:48,694 --> 00:54:50,491
I know.

1107
00:54:50,562 --> 00:54:53,224
I'm scared, too.

1108
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:04,673
Hey, guys.

1109
00:55:04,743 --> 00:55:06,108
Survive without me?

1110
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:08,510
So far, so good. Smooth sailing.

1111
00:55:10,249 --> 00:55:11,648
Forceps.

1112
00:55:11,717 --> 00:55:13,548
Oh, you guys are flying.

1113
00:55:13,619 --> 00:55:15,177
- Yeah.
- Watch your flow.

1114
00:55:16,488 --> 00:55:18,479
Larry. Larry, Larry.

1115
00:55:18,557 --> 00:55:21,321
Look at my eye.

1116
00:55:21,393 --> 00:55:24,362
Come on, man. Can you see that?

1117
00:55:24,429 --> 00:55:26,329
Why am I crying, huh?

1118
00:55:26,398 --> 00:55:28,127
Something's wrong.

1119
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,328
Larry. Larry, look.

1120
00:55:31,403 --> 00:55:33,997
Come on, man. Look at my eye.

1121
00:55:34,072 --> 00:55:35,869
Come on, Larry, look!

1122
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:40,170
Pull it back so I can see...

1123
00:55:41,947 --> 00:55:44,814
- Hold on.
- All right, here we are.

1124
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,784
- Okay.
- Clamp that.

1125
00:55:47,853 --> 00:55:50,515
- Get me the suction.
- All right.

1126
00:55:50,589 --> 00:55:52,784
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1127
00:55:52,858 --> 00:55:55,088
Hold on. Hold on.

1128
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:02,025
Yeah. Yeah.
You got it. Come on.

1129
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,933
I'm sorry, I can't
go to the game tonight.

1130
00:56:05,003 --> 00:56:06,937
My old lady and I have a date.

1131
00:56:10,776 --> 00:56:12,835
You f...

1132
00:56:16,148 --> 00:56:18,207
Why don't I give you both tickets?

1133
00:56:18,283 --> 00:56:19,910
- Really?
- Sure.

1134
00:56:19,985 --> 00:56:21,043
You can take your old lady.

1135
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,746
Make a night of it, go out on the town.

1136
00:56:25,324 --> 00:56:28,191
Something's wrong.

1137
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,251
I can feel that something's wrong.

1138
00:56:30,329 --> 00:56:31,956
What is it?

1139
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:33,463
I can't just sit here like this.

1140
00:56:33,532 --> 00:56:36,695
They should have told us something by now.

1141
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:39,259
- Listen to me.
- No, you don't understand.

1142
00:56:39,338 --> 00:56:40,999
He's not just my son.

1143
00:56:41,073 --> 00:56:42,734
I was a kid when I had him.

1144
00:56:42,808 --> 00:56:44,173
He's going to be fine.

1145
00:56:44,242 --> 00:56:47,370
We've grown up together.
It's me and him.

1146
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:49,243
He's not going to die.

1147
00:56:49,314 --> 00:56:53,341
Not now, not today.

1148
00:56:53,418 --> 00:56:54,749
He's going to live.

1149
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:57,050
How can you be so sure?

1150
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,716
Because he's got too much to live for.

1151
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,325
Well, I've got a big
Halloween party tonight,

1152
00:57:07,399 --> 00:57:09,094
but how about
I sneak out afterward?

1153
00:57:09,167 --> 00:57:10,691
What's wrong with right now?

1154
00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:12,202
Well, I can't. I'm...

1155
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:16,468
I know it's daylight
and all, but I missed you.

1156
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:18,338
You look beautiful, Sam.

1157
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:19,877
<i>- I do?
- Look at you.</i>

1158
00:57:19,945 --> 00:57:20,912
Yeah, you do.

1159
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,446
I should tell you that more often.

1160
00:57:22,514 --> 00:57:25,210
<i>What would the old man
think of you now?</i>

1161
00:57:27,018 --> 00:57:29,987
<i>You lost it all, Clay.</i>

1162
00:57:30,055 --> 00:57:34,219
<i>Everything he gave you, everything he made,</i>

1163
00:57:34,292 --> 00:57:36,055
<i>it's gone.</i>

1164
00:57:37,596 --> 00:57:40,087
<i>You gave it all away.</i>

1165
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,292
Heart's in.

1166
00:57:42,367 --> 00:57:44,858
All right, pressure down.

1167
00:57:44,936 --> 00:57:46,301
Pressure down.

1168
00:57:46,371 --> 00:57:48,999
Okay, release the clamp.

1169
00:57:49,074 --> 00:57:51,804
Cross-clamp released.

1170
00:57:53,111 --> 00:57:54,738
Wait a minute.

1171
00:57:55,881 --> 00:57:56,939
Wait, wait, wait.
Something's wrong.

1172
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,815
Okay, re... re-clamp.

1173
00:58:00,886 --> 00:58:02,148
He's... He's fibbing.

1174
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,653
You getting anything?

1175
00:58:03,722 --> 00:58:05,519
- Nothing.
- All right, all right.

1176
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:08,218
Charge paddles n... now.

1177
00:58:08,293 --> 00:58:09,817
Come on. Now, Penny. Hurry.

1178
00:58:09,895 --> 00:58:14,457
You know, you really
shouldn't smoke these things.

1179
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:16,933
It's not good for you.

1180
00:58:17,002 --> 00:58:18,765
Especially with your condition.

1181
00:58:18,837 --> 00:58:22,603
- My condition?
- Yep.

1182
00:58:22,674 --> 00:58:24,141
How do you know
about my condition?

1183
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,938
<i>So many details.</i>

1184
00:58:26,011 --> 00:58:28,104
I know a lot more
about you than you think.

1185
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,978
<i>- I didn't even see.
- Is that a fact?</i>

1186
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,482
Of course.

1187
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:35,315
<i>Christ, I missed everything.</i>

1188
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:38,948
<i>What was I looking at?</i>

1189
00:58:39,024 --> 00:58:41,959
Was I looking at you?

1190
00:58:42,027 --> 00:58:44,996
I hope you're happy, Sam.

1191
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:47,293
And I hope you get what you deserve.

1192
00:58:47,365 --> 00:58:49,390
Got nothing?

1193
00:58:49,468 --> 00:58:52,869
- Okay.
- Paddles to 20.

1194
00:58:52,938 --> 00:58:54,701
- Amio's running.
- Charge.

1195
00:58:54,773 --> 00:58:57,207
Charge it again.

1196
00:58:57,275 --> 00:58:58,708
Charge.

1197
00:58:58,777 --> 00:59:01,473
Are your lats okay?

1198
00:59:01,546 --> 00:59:02,877
Charge it to 40, please.

1199
00:59:02,948 --> 00:59:04,142
- Jack.
- Jesus.

1200
00:59:04,216 --> 00:59:06,411
Charge it one more time, please.

1201
00:59:06,485 --> 00:59:07,782
<i>Don't fight it.</i>

1202
00:59:07,853 --> 00:59:10,321
Just charge it one more time.

1203
00:59:10,388 --> 00:59:11,980
Charge.

1204
00:59:12,057 --> 00:59:14,548
Marry me.

1205
00:59:14,626 --> 00:59:15,684
What?

1206
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,092
<i>- Here we go.
- Tonight. Right now.</i>

1207
00:59:18,163 --> 00:59:20,222
- Marry me.
- It's the middle of the night.

1208
00:59:24,302 --> 00:59:26,361
We're losing him.

1209
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:28,372
We gotta get him back on bypass.

1210
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,372
No, no, no, not yet.

1211
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:31,636
Just one more time.

1212
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:33,439
It's over, Jack. He's done.

1213
00:59:33,512 --> 00:59:34,570
We have to put him back on...

1214
00:59:34,646 --> 00:59:36,204
What about the adrenaline?

1215
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,407
It won't make a difference.

1216
00:59:37,482 --> 00:59:39,814
A shot of adrenaline, please.

1217
00:59:39,885 --> 00:59:41,910
Please!

1218
00:59:43,688 --> 00:59:46,521
Come on, you son of a bitch.

1219
00:59:46,591 --> 00:59:47,683
Jack.

1220
00:59:47,759 --> 00:59:48,953
- Sure there's no air?
- No air.

1221
00:59:49,027 --> 00:59:50,426
I'm looking at it.
There's no air.

1222
00:59:50,495 --> 00:59:52,292
It's over, Jack.

1223
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:56,191
Shit.

1224
00:59:56,268 --> 00:59:58,361
I'm sorry, Jack.

1225
01:00:00,405 --> 01:00:02,373
It's my fault.

1226
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,101
No.

1227
01:00:04,175 --> 01:00:05,642
It's my fault.

1228
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:07,075
Jack, come on.

1229
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:10,273
No, it is. It's...

1230
01:00:10,348 --> 01:00:13,408
There's gotta be
something I could have done,

1231
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:15,282
something I could have tried.

1232
01:00:15,353 --> 01:00:18,288
Jack, you did everything
you could do.

1233
01:00:18,356 --> 01:00:20,586
Did I?

1234
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:23,219
You did all you could do, Jack.

1235
01:00:23,295 --> 01:00:25,820
It was a bad heart.

1236
01:00:34,105 --> 01:00:36,266
We should tell the family.

1237
01:00:37,542 --> 01:00:39,032
Any volunteers?

1238
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:40,839
I'll do it.

1239
01:00:40,912 --> 01:00:43,403
I'm the one that should
be talking to them.

1240
01:00:48,653 --> 01:00:50,484
- I'll go with him.
- Yeah.

1241
01:00:50,555 --> 01:00:52,614
Thank you.

1242
01:01:02,834 --> 01:01:06,133
So?

1243
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,694
He rejected the heart.

1244
01:01:09,808 --> 01:01:12,800
We did everything
we could, but the...

1245
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:15,710
the organ failed, and I am so sorry.

1246
01:01:19,451 --> 01:01:22,318
The organ failed?

1247
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:26,084
Yes. It wouldn't respond
to the procedure.

1248
01:01:26,157 --> 01:01:28,648
But in cases like this,
it's not uncommon for...

1249
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:31,890
Don't you mean you failed?

1250
01:01:31,963 --> 01:01:33,954
No, we...

1251
01:01:34,032 --> 01:01:36,557
we did everything that we could.

1252
01:01:36,635 --> 01:01:38,660
It's just an imperfect procedure.

1253
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:40,967
Say it.

1254
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:42,506
Say what?

1255
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:46,135
I want to hear you say it.
I want to hear you say...

1256
01:01:46,211 --> 01:01:48,839
you failed my son.

1257
01:01:53,718 --> 01:01:55,686
It shouldn't have been you.
It should never have been you.

1258
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:58,917
I fucking knew it.

1259
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:04,084
I'm... I'm sorry, Sam.

1260
01:02:09,534 --> 01:02:12,560
Um...

1261
01:02:12,637 --> 01:02:14,229
I'm afraid we're going
to need your permission

1262
01:02:14,305 --> 01:02:15,636
to take him off bypass.

1263
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:19,343
What?

1264
01:02:19,411 --> 01:02:21,538
We'll need your permission.

1265
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:24,514
I'm so sorry to have to ask.

1266
01:02:24,582 --> 01:02:26,482
I don't understand.

1267
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,178
He's alive?

1268
01:02:30,255 --> 01:02:34,351
Yes, but his blood's being
pumped by a machine.

1269
01:02:34,426 --> 01:02:35,358
He has no heart.

1270
01:02:35,427 --> 01:02:37,452
Then get him another heart.

1271
01:02:37,529 --> 01:02:38,496
You don't understand.

1272
01:02:38,563 --> 01:02:40,861
His blood type's too rare.

1273
01:02:40,932 --> 01:02:41,990
We don't have one.

1274
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:49,239
I'm sorry. It's... It's over.

1275
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:51,104
Thank you.

1276
01:03:00,452 --> 01:03:03,683
I'll be in the hallway.

1277
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,388
Lilith...

1278
01:03:09,461 --> 01:03:11,656
Could you leave me
alone for a minute?

1279
01:03:12,764 --> 01:03:14,231
Okay.

1280
01:03:34,252 --> 01:03:36,152
It's done.

1281
01:03:43,428 --> 01:03:44,417
Okay.

1282
01:04:40,885 --> 01:04:42,011
Hey.

1283
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:43,246
Hey.

1284
01:04:45,223 --> 01:04:47,191
What are you doing?

1285
01:04:51,029 --> 01:04:52,587
Hey.

1286
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:57,966
Just wanted to see
if you needed anything.

1287
01:04:58,036 --> 01:05:01,972
Wanted to see how you were doing.

1288
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:06,101
I know it's hard to even think about
anything else right now, but...

1289
01:05:08,246 --> 01:05:10,646
Are you okay?

1290
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:14,208
You okay?

1291
01:05:24,162 --> 01:05:25,527
What are you doing here?

1292
01:05:25,597 --> 01:05:27,929
I wasn't staying
out there without you.

1293
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:34,601
She's in here somewhere.

1294
01:05:34,672 --> 01:05:36,469
Look around.

1295
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:44,744
God damn it.

1296
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:46,340
Bailey, call the code.

1297
01:05:46,417 --> 01:05:48,180
It's too late.

1298
01:05:53,725 --> 01:05:55,283
All right,
let's prep her for surgery.

1299
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:00,864
I don't understand.

1300
01:06:00,932 --> 01:06:03,958
You're going to live, Clay.

1301
01:06:04,035 --> 01:06:08,233
Think I'll take it from here, Jack.

1302
01:06:08,306 --> 01:06:09,432
It's too late.

1303
01:06:11,276 --> 01:06:14,302
We did everything we could,
but the body rejected the heart.

1304
01:06:14,379 --> 01:06:16,643
Well, I think we solved that problem.

1305
01:06:19,651 --> 01:06:21,243
I have a strong heart, Clay.

1306
01:06:21,319 --> 01:06:22,411
Let's go.

1307
01:06:22,487 --> 01:06:24,546
Let's prep her for transplant.

1308
01:06:24,622 --> 01:06:27,318
Always have.

1309
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:34,098
You can go.
We've been prepped.

1310
01:06:34,165 --> 01:06:35,393
What do you mean?

1311
01:06:35,466 --> 01:06:36,956
You can run.

1312
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:38,730
Police will be here soon.

1313
01:06:40,104 --> 01:06:41,662
What'd you use, Jack?

1314
01:06:41,739 --> 01:06:44,833
Formaldehy... No, wait.

1315
01:06:44,909 --> 01:06:46,001
Adriamycin.

1316
01:06:46,077 --> 01:06:47,840
Right.

1317
01:06:47,912 --> 01:06:50,710
Less residue.

1318
01:06:50,782 --> 01:06:52,579
Guys.

1319
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:54,117
Jack, come on. Let's go.

1320
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:57,212
Jack, what are you doing?

1321
01:06:57,288 --> 01:06:59,654
Let's go. Now, Jack.

1322
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,851
What the hell happened to you?

1323
01:07:11,502 --> 01:07:13,732
I told you not to trust them.

1324
01:07:13,805 --> 01:07:14,863
I don't get it.

1325
01:07:14,939 --> 01:07:16,406
You're telling me that you knew?

1326
01:07:16,474 --> 01:07:19,966
No, no. Not at first.

1327
01:07:20,044 --> 01:07:23,172
I had no idea.

1328
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:26,114
She did everything right.

1329
01:07:26,184 --> 01:07:30,746
And then, she made one little mistake.

1330
01:07:30,822 --> 01:07:32,983
She left her purse in the waiting room.

1331
01:07:33,057 --> 01:07:35,958
Forget ethics.

1332
01:07:36,027 --> 01:07:37,551
You got five minutes.

1333
01:07:37,628 --> 01:07:38,993
You know where I'll be.

1334
01:07:39,063 --> 01:07:41,759
I don't trust anyone else.

1335
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:43,733
It has to be you.

1336
01:07:43,801 --> 01:07:46,702
The mail, Clay.

1337
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:49,001
She still had her mail.

1338
01:07:49,073 --> 01:07:51,337
Wait. Jonathan?

1339
01:07:57,448 --> 01:08:00,542
Haven't I see you around?

1340
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:02,916
Only took me a second to put it together.

1341
01:08:02,987 --> 01:08:04,818
Sometimes you have
to hold the button down

1342
01:08:04,889 --> 01:08:07,357
for a while to get it to work.

1343
01:08:07,425 --> 01:08:09,757
She'd been to that hospital before.

1344
01:08:09,827 --> 01:08:12,352
You're not a doctor at this hospital.

1345
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:17,561
I mean, you don't work here, do you?

1346
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:18,761
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1347
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:24,566
Why didn't you just say something?

1348
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:27,236
There was no time.

1349
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:31,179
You were dying, you needed a heart.

1350
01:08:31,249 --> 01:08:33,683
I had no choice.

1351
01:08:36,687 --> 01:08:40,418
Get a DLP vent ready.

1352
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:41,753
Doctor, how does he look?

1353
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:44,294
Terrible.
He's been on bypass too long.

1354
01:08:44,362 --> 01:08:45,590
Let's prep the new organ.

1355
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:47,187
Still going to attempt transplant?

1356
01:08:47,265 --> 01:08:49,597
Well, I might
have to do an autopsy.

1357
01:08:51,903 --> 01:08:53,097
Give me a knife and a flat vent.

1358
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,403
Sorry, Lilith.

1359
01:08:57,475 --> 01:08:59,875
I'm so sorry.

1360
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:05,911
I'm looking for it.

1361
01:09:05,983 --> 01:09:07,780
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

1362
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:12,949
Beresford transplant...
operating room B.

1363
01:09:13,991 --> 01:09:15,356
Becky, it's me.

1364
01:09:15,426 --> 01:09:16,984
Listen, get her up
and get her dressed now.

1365
01:09:17,061 --> 01:09:18,551
I'm coming back.

1366
01:09:18,629 --> 01:09:20,529
Becky, just do it, okay?

1367
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,295
My car is downstairs.

1368
01:09:28,773 --> 01:09:30,968
Doctor?

1369
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:32,839
Larry.

1370
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:33,934
You're not going to believe what...

1371
01:09:34,011 --> 01:09:35,638
Over here!

1372
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:41,284
Stop! Hands up!

1373
01:09:42,854 --> 01:09:43,843
Ah!

1374
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:51,286
Give me the heart.

1375
01:09:51,362 --> 01:09:54,297
Heartbeat in position.

1376
01:09:54,365 --> 01:09:56,833
Get a 3-0 ready.

1377
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,266
No, no, no. It's too fast.

1378
01:09:58,336 --> 01:09:59,963
- What if...
- I'll do the worrying.

1379
01:10:00,037 --> 01:10:01,095
Here, watch that clamp.

1380
01:10:01,172 --> 01:10:02,605
Pick up stitch.

1381
01:10:03,608 --> 01:10:06,168
Come on, come on.

1382
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:08,303
Load the Milrinone.

1383
01:10:08,379 --> 01:10:10,711
Just give me time. We need to move.

1384
01:10:18,356 --> 01:10:20,881
Come here.

1385
01:10:20,958 --> 01:10:23,483
- What the fuck is going on?
- Relax.

1386
01:10:23,561 --> 01:10:24,789
Look, what did I tell you?

1387
01:10:24,862 --> 01:10:26,386
I told you I was going
to look after you, didn't I?

1388
01:10:26,464 --> 01:10:29,160
You trusted me this far,
so just keep quiet.

1389
01:10:29,233 --> 01:10:31,701
I almost forgot.

1390
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:34,636
I've had this way too long
to leave this behind.

1391
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:37,070
Three-one.

1392
01:10:37,141 --> 01:10:40,110
Wet his hands.

1393
01:10:40,178 --> 01:10:41,577
John, we're running out of time.

1394
01:10:41,646 --> 01:10:43,511
We're almost there.
We're almost there.

1395
01:10:43,581 --> 01:10:44,707
Scissor.

1396
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:46,147
Cut.

1397
01:10:47,685 --> 01:10:51,052
Head down, pressure down.

1398
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:53,818
Cross clamp off.

1399
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:59,695
- We got rhythm.
- Looks good.

1400
01:11:05,002 --> 01:11:06,333
I can't go with you.

1401
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:10,672
What?

1402
01:11:10,741 --> 01:11:12,732
They want you.

1403
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:16,371
You're the one who
injected the heart, not me.

1404
01:11:16,447 --> 01:11:17,744
They don't want me.

1405
01:11:20,451 --> 01:11:21,748
Sam.

1406
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:25,050
I'm sorry.

1407
01:11:25,122 --> 01:11:28,023
I'm just the grieving
widow, remember?

1408
01:11:31,729 --> 01:11:32,957
I didn't do anything wrong.

1409
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:34,657
- Yeah, you did.
- No!

1410
01:11:37,568 --> 01:11:39,934
Going to be kind of hard
to play a grieving widow

1411
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:41,938
with your fingerprints
all on the syringe.

1412
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:44,804
Jack.

1413
01:11:44,875 --> 01:11:47,070
Jack, come on.

1414
01:11:47,144 --> 01:11:48,076
Let me in.

1415
01:11:49,213 --> 01:11:50,703
Jack.

1416
01:11:50,781 --> 01:11:52,772
Come on.

1417
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:55,114
Please?

1418
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:57,381
Goddamn you.
Open the fucking door.

1419
01:11:57,455 --> 01:11:59,286
Open the door now!

1420
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:01,484
Jack, please!

1421
01:12:01,559 --> 01:12:02,526
Open the fucking door.

1422
01:12:02,593 --> 01:12:04,117
Bye, Sam.

1423
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:05,958
Jack!

1424
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:14,933
Closing the chest. Pressure okay?

1425
01:12:15,006 --> 01:12:17,338
No Vicryl.

1426
01:12:17,408 --> 01:12:18,602
Sop it wet.

1427
01:12:18,676 --> 01:12:20,507
Yeah.

1428
01:12:20,578 --> 01:12:21,738
Scissor, please.

1429
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:25,181
Cut.

1430
01:12:31,822 --> 01:12:32,880
Great job.

1431
01:12:32,957 --> 01:12:34,288
Well, we do what we can.

1432
01:12:34,358 --> 01:12:35,655
Amazing.

1433
01:12:38,629 --> 01:12:39,561
God damn it.

1434
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:42,064
- He's in fib.
- Shit.

1435
01:12:42,133 --> 01:12:44,192
Get me an amp of eppy now.

1436
01:12:44,268 --> 01:12:45,496
Clay.

1437
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:47,059
Come on, Clayton.

1438
01:12:47,138 --> 01:12:49,129
I'm trying to be a hero here.
Don't make me look bad.

1439
01:12:50,641 --> 01:12:52,438
I'm going to stay here with you.

1440
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:54,705
There's no one left
for me out there anyway.

1441
01:12:54,779 --> 01:12:56,303
You don't need anyone else.

1442
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:58,814
You do it yourself, Clay.

1443
01:12:58,883 --> 01:13:00,748
- You're strong.
- I'm not him.

1444
01:13:00,818 --> 01:13:02,046
I tried, Mom.

1445
01:13:02,119 --> 01:13:05,452
Really, I did, but...
I'm just not him.

1446
01:13:05,523 --> 01:13:06,512
He's still in fib.

1447
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:08,353
- Clay.
- Never going to be.

1448
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:10,792
- Charge the paddles.
- I don't want you to be.

1449
01:13:10,861 --> 01:13:12,522
We're losing him.

1450
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:16,623
200.

1451
01:13:16,701 --> 01:13:17,759
Clear.

1452
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:20,102
Come on.

1453
01:13:20,171 --> 01:13:22,799
I have to show you something.

1454
01:13:22,873 --> 01:13:24,363
I don't want to see this.

1455
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:26,000
I'm afraid you have to.

1456
01:13:26,077 --> 01:13:29,012
<i>Remember, Clay?</i>

1457
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,913
I am remembering.

1458
01:13:31,982 --> 01:13:34,450
I'm watching the TV.
What do you want from me?

1459
01:13:34,518 --> 01:13:36,042
No, you're not. Look.

1460
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:39,946
You're listening.

1461
01:13:40,024 --> 01:13:41,491
...are we going to talk about this, Lilith?

1462
01:13:41,559 --> 01:13:42,890
How many fucking times?

1463
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,825
I don't want to remember anymore.

1464
01:13:44,895 --> 01:13:46,726
- Jesus, don't you ever shut up?
- You never did.

1465
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:48,094
I gotta get the fuck out of here.

1466
01:13:48,165 --> 01:13:49,393
This is bullshit.

1467
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:52,766
This is just
my imagination, that's all.

1468
01:13:52,837 --> 01:13:54,327
Just watch.

1469
01:13:55,406 --> 01:13:56,338
Come on, Clayton. Come on.

1470
01:13:56,407 --> 01:13:58,637
- No change.
- Give me 300.

1471
01:13:58,709 --> 01:14:01,542
Start mixing amio.

1472
01:14:01,612 --> 01:14:03,603
- Clayton, come on.
- Charge.

1473
01:14:03,681 --> 01:14:04,705
Clear.

1474
01:14:07,685 --> 01:14:08,652
Daddy?

1475
01:14:11,422 --> 01:14:13,913
Hey! Hey! Stop talking.

1476
01:14:17,395 --> 01:14:18,657
Dad.

1477
01:14:18,729 --> 01:14:21,698
All right, I heard you the first time!

1478
01:14:21,766 --> 01:14:24,428
Come on, Clayton. It's Christmas.

1479
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:26,231
Put it on.

1480
01:14:26,303 --> 01:14:27,565
Ah!

1481
01:14:27,638 --> 01:14:30,368
- Daddy, please!
- Fucking bitch. Jesus!

1482
01:14:30,441 --> 01:14:32,068
Don't you two ever shut up?

1483
01:14:32,143 --> 01:14:33,838
This is what you want, Lilith, isn't it?

1484
01:14:33,911 --> 01:14:35,173
Huh? How's this look?

1485
01:14:35,246 --> 01:14:36,235
This make you happy?

1486
01:14:36,313 --> 01:14:37,371
Daddy, please!

1487
01:14:37,448 --> 01:14:38,380
All right. That's it!

1488
01:14:38,449 --> 01:14:39,814
Please leave him alone.

1489
01:14:39,884 --> 01:14:41,875
Couldn't keep your mouth shut,
could you, Clay?

1490
01:14:41,952 --> 01:14:43,112
- Clayton.
- Come here.

1491
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:45,212
- Please.
- Come here!

1492
01:14:45,289 --> 01:14:46,415
- Clayton!
- Come here!

1493
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:00,303
I said leave him alone.

1494
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:35,337
- Still in fib.
- Give me 360.

1495
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:38,000
- We lost him.
- No. Again.

1496
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:40,168
- 360.
- Clear.

1497
01:15:47,785 --> 01:15:50,219
You didn't want to remember, Clay.

1498
01:15:52,389 --> 01:15:54,516
I let you forget
because I thought the truth

1499
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:58,961
would be too hard to live with.

1500
01:15:59,029 --> 01:16:01,930
I thought I was protecting you.

1501
01:16:01,999 --> 01:16:05,901
But all I did
was cause you more pain.

1502
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:08,131
I am so sorry.

1503
01:16:10,574 --> 01:16:14,772
I'm not proud
of what I became, Clay,

1504
01:16:14,845 --> 01:16:18,076
but I am proud
of what you've become.

1505
01:16:18,148 --> 01:16:21,208
You're a hundred times
the man he was.

1506
01:16:23,787 --> 01:16:25,755
You always were.

1507
01:16:37,234 --> 01:16:39,759
It's time for you to live.

1508
01:17:05,896 --> 01:17:06,863
Clayton...

1509
01:17:06,931 --> 01:17:08,398
Stop.

1510
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,058
We got him.

1511
01:17:14,538 --> 01:17:16,733
Welcome back, Clayton.

1512
01:17:18,309 --> 01:17:20,277
Welcome back.

1513
01:17:27,484 --> 01:17:31,181
<i>At 6:32 this morning,</i>

1514
01:17:31,255 --> 01:17:35,715
<i>on Thursday, the first of November,</i>

1515
01:17:35,793 --> 01:17:40,594
<i>Clayton Beresford, Jr.,
died on my operating table.</i>

1516
01:17:44,101 --> 01:17:49,368

his life was saved.</i>

1517
01:17:52,076 --> 01:17:56,479
<i>There are no excuses for what we did.</i>

1518
01:17:56,547 --> 01:17:59,311
<i>There's no defense,</i>

1519
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:01,351
<i>no one to blame but us.</i>

1520
01:18:03,587 --> 01:18:06,784
<i>We got what we deserved.</i>

1521
01:18:06,857 --> 01:18:10,122
<i>Clay would have his revenge,</i>

1522
01:18:10,194 --> 01:18:13,163
<i>and justice would finally be served.</i>

1523
01:18:14,832 --> 01:18:18,029
<i>For despite all the secrets,</i>

1524
