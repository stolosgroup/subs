<i>L'Afrique.</i>

3
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,501
To Tangier.

00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:15,637
<i>- Tangier!
- Tangier!</i>

5
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:19,641
How can it take this long
to sort out a car,

6
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:20,875
for fuck's sake?

7
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:23,678
It's Morocco, not Milton Keynes.

8
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:25,546
- Hey!
- What's the matter?

9
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:31,251
- Glad we aren't staying here.
- Mm.

10
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:34,421
We'll stay on the way back.
Might be interesting.

11
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,758
Interesting in a good way
or interesting in a bad way?

12
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:41,763
It's 400 miles to Azna.

13
00:02:41,796 --> 00:02:42,806
Long way to go for a party,

14
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,465
but then they're more
your friends than mine.

15
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,701
That'll be news to Richard.

16
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:13,487
Look at them.
Continental wildebeest.

17
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:15,990
You'd think
they hadn't eaten in days.

18
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:17,501
Maybe they don't give them
any sandwiches

19
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:18,893
on those buses.

20
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,265
Should you still be drinking?

21
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,536
It's just a glass.

22
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,303
You'll finish the bottle
like you always do.

23
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,039
Why am I thinking harpy?

24
00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:34,008
Why am I thinking shrill?

25
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:37,344
Why am I thinking
highly functioning alcoholic?

26
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,889
I've always thought
the highly functioning part

27
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:41,783
should cancel out
the alcoholic part.

28
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:43,684
You know,
like a double negative.

29
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,687
Besides, the roads are empty.

30
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:39,874
It's not a military timetable.

31
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:41,441
Do you want to stay here
a night?

32
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:44,679
I want to get to Richard's.

33
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:49,382
It's all right.

34
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,686
They treat their women
like donkeys.

35
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,754
To them, you're just
an escaped donkey.

36
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:55,464
You know I hate it
when you say things like that.

37
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,466
- Well, it's true, isn't it?
- It doesn't matter if it is.

38
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,492
I'd say it matters.
I'd say it matters very much.

39
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:00,938
You have no idea
how they treat their women.

40
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:02,395
None.

41
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:05,766
- Ah, Monsieur?
- Oui?

42
00:06:13,074 --> 00:06:14,075
Merci.

43
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:17,912
Damn internet.

44
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:20,848
- Face it, David, we're lost.
- We're not lost.

45
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:23,483
We just have to find
the turn-off to Azna.

46
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:26,687
- Is this the right road?
- There's only one road.

47
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:29,422
We just passed through Midelt.
We should turn towards Tafnet.

48
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,291
I didn't see any other road
that might fit...

49
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:32,860
I didn't say anything
about Tafnet.

50
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:33,327
Doesn't matter,
this is the right...

51
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:34,729
We left too late.

52
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:35,395
Yes, of course, it's my fault.

53
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,230
Because you insisted on us...

54
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:37,641
Change the bloody record,
would you?

55
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:38,498
I'm going to call Richard.

56
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,034
No, we're not calling
bloody anyone.

57
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:45,472
Must be one of the guests.

58
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:47,706
- But what if they're not?
- They're white, aren't they?

59
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:25,513
Strange, they didn't stop.

60
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:28,082
What if we'd had a crash?
They didn't even slow down.

61
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:32,195
- That's the turn.
- No, it's not.

62
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,587
- This is the turn.
- No, David.

63
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,856
Don't be so bloody stupid.

64
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:49,804
Welcome.

65
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,995
Cocktail, sir.

66
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:16,897
Shukran. Merci.
Fuck it, whatever.

67
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:19,300
All on your Pat Malone?

68
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,003
My wife ran off
with the hedge fund manager.

69
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:23,971
Oh, I did that once.

70
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:25,940
How'd it work out?

71
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:28,175
He let me keep the condo
in Cabo.

72
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:34,582
You like the music?
It's very unique.

73
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,784
No, it's not.

74
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,185
They used to play it
on every floor

75
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,154
of every Virgin Me gas tore.

76
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:44,058
Oh, you're one of those people.

77
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,227
Oh, maybe.

78
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:49,196
Okay, bye-bye.

79
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:57,338
Uh, thank you.

80
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,640
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you. Shut up.

81
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:03,978
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

82
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:05,780
Thank you all for attending

83
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:08,315
our little soirée out here
in the desert.

84
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:11,786
This magnificent edifice
in which you'll be staying

85
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:13,788
is what's known as a Ksour.

86
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:16,290
- That's Arab for castle.
- Thank you, Dally.

87
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:19,193
The renovation proceeds at pace.

88
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,729
Dally and I never thought
it would turn out so well.

89
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,931
The renovation's
a complete farce.

90
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:26,167
And we couldn't have done it
without the wonderful help

91
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,702
of our little Moroccan friends.

92
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,205
Baksheesh.

93
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,975
So, look, we hope
you'll find this place

94
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:36,343
a vision of paradise.

95
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:40,381
A place in which to receive
the people we love.

96
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,750
But enough waffling.

97
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,023
Dinner will be served promptly,

98
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,252
at 11:00, at which point

99
00:09:45,286 --> 00:09:47,855
I encourage you
to try the pastry

100
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,124
stuffed with sardines
created by our chef,

101
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:52,093
monsieur Ben. Sensational.

102
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:53,861
In the meantime,
please sample the honey.

103
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,930
It's the best in the world,
and locally sourced.

104
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:57,231
And don't forget the figs,

105
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,767
traditionally representative
of a woman's vagina.

106
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,836
Or so we've been told.

107
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:07,241
<i>- Sláinte.
- Sláinte.</i>

108
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:15,049
- Dicky.
- Hey, Tom.

109
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,251
I didn't see you there.

110
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,186
Did one of the boys
get you a drink?

111
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,855
Can't be in a library
without a drink.

112
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:22,056
Haven't seen anyone.

113
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:25,226
Maybe they're sorting
out the quail.

114
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:28,362
Speaking of quail,
did you bring a hotsy-totsy?

115
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,297
Girls won't touch me these days.

116
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:31,765
What about boys?

117
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,070
Dally tells me
you have 1,000 girlfriends.

118
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:38,272
I've got three
and they all hate me.

119
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,745
You should get down to the pool.
Have you seen those Russians?

120
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:41,775
Oh là I.

121
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,878
David. It's Richard.

122
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:46,981
Where the bloody hell
have you and Jo got to? Call me.

123
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:49,717
- Who's that?
- Old friend.

124
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,785
He's an alcoholic.
I shouldn't have let him drive.

125
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:55,089
Do people get lost driving here?

126
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:57,391
All the time.
We say it's part of the charm.

127
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,294
You have an impressive house.

128
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,767
I have an eye for
Islamic art, my time at Christie's.

129
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:05,451
Why don't you live here
all year round?

130
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,703
One has to get a little older
before moving to the desert.

131
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:12,139
Dally's not ready yet. I am.

132
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,373
I take it
you're not a friend of...

133
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:49,243
I'm here on assignment
to do a profile.

134
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:52,213
But I'm really only here
because of Leila Tarki.

135
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,082
I have no idea who that is.

136
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:59,119
You don't know Leila Tarki?
The Moroccan auteur?

137
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:00,287
She's the coolest.

138
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:02,189
She's only here
to raise financing

139
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:04,792
- for a new movie.
- Oh, movie, huh?

140
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:07,228
- What's it about?
- Nomads.

141
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,397
Nomads. Right.

142
00:12:10,431 --> 00:12:12,199
At least
it's not about refugees.

143
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:13,801
One thing to be thankful for.

144
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:17,304
- Nomads are going to save us.
- Are they?

145
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:20,174
They have the right
environmental ideas.

146
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:22,376
Leila says I look like a nomad.

147
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:51,105
We were driving along there...

148
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:53,107
and we saw a couple
by the side of the road.

149
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,342
Oh, we thought
they'd just had sex.

150
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:57,579
This is the Henningers,
the English couple?

151
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:59,847
Yes, I suppose.

152
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,416
Could have been bandits
dressed as English people.

153
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,984
Or English bandits.

154
00:13:04,018 --> 00:13:09,123
Plenty of those around
of the "ass" variety.

155
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,526
Are you gay as well?

156
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,228
No, I'm not.
But I fucked a man who is.

157
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,140
Were they having an argument?

158
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,600
I don't know.

159
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:20,200
They're not here though,
are they?

160
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,575
Thank you, Dally.
Friends.

161
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:30,512
Life is but a sport
or a pastime,

162
00:13:30,545 --> 00:13:33,447
as the Qur'an tells us.

163
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,983
And, because it is
a game and nothing more,

164
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:39,286
we forget that the point
of life is death.

165
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,456
So, eat, drink, be merry,
for tomorrow we die.

166
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:45,392
A little hackneyed, my love.

167
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:56,136
What do you think
of the outfits?

168
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,105
I designed them myself.

169
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:00,508
Completely authentic.

170
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:03,010
- Are they?
- Yeah they are.

171
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,546
They may as well be statues.

172
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:05,547
What's that supposed to mean?

173
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,883
- What kind of name is Dally?
- It's a nickname.

174
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:12,453
An insult or an endearment?

175
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:14,221
Take your fucking pick.

176
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,206
What.

177
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:36,643
Dicky.

178
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:00,502
Good God.

179
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:03,036
Hit him on the road.
It's very unclear.

180
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,507
Unclear?
Why would it be unclear?

181
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,417
They say he was selling fossils
by the side of the road.

182
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:09,511
He stepped out
and they hit him by accident.

183
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:12,956
But there has never been
a fossil seller on that road

184
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,616
at night.

185
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:17,017
Or during the day.
That's why it's unclear.

186
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,153
Anyone recognize him?

187
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:22,022
No, he's not from here.
He's from the South.

188
00:15:25,527 --> 00:15:27,494
What about
the tattoo? A diamond.

189
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,964
Ouarida.

190
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:33,066
It is for protection
against the evil eye.

191
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:36,170
Didn't bloody work then, did it?

192
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:38,272
Lay him out somewhere.

193
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:41,275
- The garage?
- Yes, the garage. Good idea.

194
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:42,385
We don't want the guests
getting wind

195
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,453
there's a body on the premises.

196
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:44,546
Last thing we need.

197
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:47,715
Shall we clean out the car?

198
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:50,951
No, we have to call
the police in Taza.

199
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:02,329
Smashed headlights,
smashed bumper.

200
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,666
Must have been going
at a fair clip.

201
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:06,266
An accident, they said.

202
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,471
Do you believe them?

203
00:16:10,505 --> 00:16:12,415
They are your guests.
How am I not to believe them?

204
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,542
But do you in fact believe them?

205
00:16:14,576 --> 00:16:17,478
I think they're scared.
And I'm thinking of a proverb.

206
00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:22,750
Go ahead.
I like a good proverb.

207
00:16:22,784 --> 00:16:25,152
Open your door to a good day

208
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,387
and prepare yourself
for a bad one.

209
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:01,021
- David.
- Richard.

210
00:17:02,857 --> 00:17:04,291
How are you feeling?

211
00:17:05,793 --> 00:17:06,961
Bloody hot.

212
00:17:06,995 --> 00:17:10,197
- It's the Sahara, old boy.
- I know it's the fucking Sahara.

213
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:15,168
Uh.

214
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:18,238
You're dressed for dinner.

215
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,241
So, the world's still normal.

216
00:17:22,544 --> 00:17:25,580
You should get changed.
Both of you. Get changed.

217
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:28,115
Have a shower,
turn up for dinner.

218
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,618
Police will be here in an hour.

219
00:17:30,652 --> 00:17:32,696
I know the officer in charge.
It will be a formality.

220
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,388
Oh, a formality, okay.

221
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:35,523
How did it happen?

222
00:17:36,758 --> 00:17:38,134
You should tell me
before we tell the police.

223
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:40,093
Get everything ironed out.

224
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:43,330
We were bowling along
looking for the sign for Azna.

225
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:48,603
And there was a lot of sand
blowing across the road.

226
00:17:48,636 --> 00:17:50,070
I couldn't see.

227
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:57,477
And he just stepped out
in front of us

228
00:17:57,512 --> 00:18:00,180
like he didn't understand
the speed of a car.

229
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:04,117
The fact is we hit him.
We hit him and we killed him.

230
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:07,454
Well, the main thing
is to come clean,

231
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,389
cooperate with the police

232
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:12,092
and seem
overwhelmingly contrite.

233
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:15,897
- We can do that, can't we?
- Mmm.

234
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,165
If it's absolutely necessary.

235
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:20,367
David.

236
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:26,139
Poor fucking kid.
When are the cops getting here?

237
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:28,208
They arrive when they arrive.

238
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,812
They arrive when they arrive.
What kind of fucking...?

239
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:33,681
Hey, this is a fucking disaster.

240
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:35,559
- Have you checked his pockets?
- Yeah, nothing in him.

241
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,518
No ID, not a single dirham,
no nothing.

242
00:18:37,552 --> 00:18:38,762
It's highly unusual
for a Moroccan

243
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:41,188
- not to be carrying ID.
- You're telling me.

244
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,724
Hey, where are those
fuckers anyway?

245
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:44,659
Dinner. Putting a brave face
on things.

246
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:47,629
- Was he drunk?
- I don't know.

247
00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:49,897
They ran right over him.

248
00:18:49,931 --> 00:18:52,366
The kid wasn't just hit.
Am I right?

249
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:53,400
Am I right?!

250
00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:58,205
What are we going to do?
I mean, you called the cops.

251
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:00,808
Now, it's going to be
a fucking circus.

252
00:19:00,842 --> 00:19:03,176
What would you suggest we do?

253
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,746
Get it settled tonight.
Pay him off.

254
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:08,626
They'd have to find out
who he is.

255
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,318
If they find that out,
things might change.

256
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:14,756
Jesus.
Are you kidding?

257
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:16,432
I don't think we have anything
to worry about.

258
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,760
- It's clear what happened.
- Oh, it is, is it?

259
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:20,236
Cause I don't think
it's clear at all.

260
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,796
I think that limey
is hiding something.

261
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:24,732
Any chance to fuck with us
and they will.

262
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:26,634
- Who?
- The Moroccans!

263
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:29,771
The family will show up
and they will fuck with us!

264
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:32,239
They'll say the infidels
killed their boy.

265
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:35,208
Which would be true.

266
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:37,512
We were saying
you must have had an accident.

267
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:38,546
A flat tire.

268
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:41,549
People always get flat tires
out in the desert.

269
00:19:42,784 --> 00:19:45,318
We all felt sorry for you.

270
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,387
A flat tire in the dark.

271
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:50,290
What a drag. Was it?

272
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,860
- Can't you see they want to eat?
- No, it's all right.

273
00:19:52,894 --> 00:19:54,529
We just need some time
to recover.

274
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:59,967
People disappear here.
They just vanish.

275
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,404
Did the Arabs molest you?

276
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:06,273
I'm sorry, I didn't get your...

277
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:08,676
<i>Enchanté.</i>

278
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:11,612
She's a nomad.

279
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:15,950
Did you pass Beni Mellal?

280
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:18,953
We came through Midelt.
It's a different road.

281
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:20,387
Did you get lost?

282
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,522
We didn't get lost.

283
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:23,825
It was just a long
slog of a drive.

284
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:24,935
It's the road
most of us came on.

285
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,728
Yes, but we didn't know it.

286
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:28,462
We didn't know
which turning it was.

287
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:32,633
So, it wasn't a flat tire.
You were just lost.

288
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,468
Not exactly.

289
00:20:34,502 --> 00:20:36,804
We hit a Moroccan on the road
and we killed him.

290
00:20:50,785 --> 00:20:54,287
It was an accident.
He stepped out in front of us.

291
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:02,764
I think you're wanted.

292
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,568
I can't understand
why you did that.

293
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:09,504
Was it to humiliate me?

294
00:21:09,537 --> 00:21:11,672
You can't keep pretending
forever. Why lie to them?

295
00:21:11,706 --> 00:21:12,916
But it wasn't our fault, was it?

296
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,350
I mean,
you don't seriously expect me

297
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:15,176
to take the fault for this

298
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:16,844
just because
some fucking carjacker

299
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:17,888
- decided to shoot the two of...
- Carjacker.

300
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:19,814
Carjacker, yes.

301
00:21:19,847 --> 00:21:22,349
You haven't been
following the news. I have.

302
00:21:23,885 --> 00:21:26,053
You have a practice in Chelsea,
monsieur Henninger.

303
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:29,489
Uhm, yes, that's... Yes.

304
00:21:29,524 --> 00:21:30,591
And you, madam?

305
00:21:31,726 --> 00:21:34,061
You write children's books,
I believe?

306
00:21:34,095 --> 00:21:37,598
Not very successful ones,
I'm afraid, Captain.

307
00:21:37,632 --> 00:21:39,534
I'm sure
you're just being modest.

308
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,669
May I have a title
I could look up for my children?

309
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:45,907
The last one was called
<i>Balthazar's Nighttime.</i>

310
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,407
It's a little pretentious.

311
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,811
Ah, but it is charming.

312
00:21:49,844 --> 00:21:51,946
Do you not find,
monsieur Galloway?

313
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:53,313
Charming.

314
00:21:55,116 --> 00:21:57,450
This man you killed.

315
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:59,954
Boy, I should say.
He was a fossil seller.

316
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,856
Yes, but I mean...

317
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:03,356
It was clear
he wasn't interested

318
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,059
in selling us fossils.

319
00:22:05,092 --> 00:22:07,862
How could he be?
This time of night.

320
00:22:07,895 --> 00:22:09,797
Middle of bloody nowhere.

321
00:22:09,831 --> 00:22:13,034
People here are desperate,
monsieur Henninger.

322
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:15,703
They would do almost anything
to sell a single fossil.

323
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:18,573
Forty Euros is a good sum
for them.

324
00:22:18,606 --> 00:22:21,642
I'm aware of that.
I know they're poor.

325
00:22:21,676 --> 00:22:23,476
We're really very sorry
about this, captain.

326
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:24,511
I mean...

327
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:27,447
We're devastated, to be honest.

328
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:30,117
Yeah, devastated.

329
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:34,622
I'm sure you are.

330
00:22:37,058 --> 00:22:39,060
By the way, I was wondering.

331
00:22:39,093 --> 00:22:41,128
You are sure there was
only one boy?

332
00:22:41,162 --> 00:22:45,833
- They often travel in pairs.
- Uh, yes, one boy.

333
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:46,877
You are sure.

334
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:49,804
- Yes, we're sure.
- Good.

335
00:22:49,837 --> 00:22:51,471
We will record it
as an accidental death.

336
00:22:52,974 --> 00:22:54,876
You'll take the body with you?

337
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:56,019
No, we cannot do that.

338
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:57,745
We do not have a morgue
at our post.

339
00:22:57,778 --> 00:22:59,814
There'll have to be arrangements
made tomorrow.

340
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:01,525
Hope you can enjoy the rest
of your weekend,

341
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:03,117
monsieur Galloway.

342
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,030
The fire-eaters from Taza
are arriving tomorrow.

343
00:23:05,653 --> 00:23:06,693
Splendid.

344
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:20,968
What do we make
of the Henningers?

345
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:24,171
She's all right.
Not sure about him.

346
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:26,574
Typical bourgeois.

347
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,078
- What are you doing?
- Stepping on diamonds.

348
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,048
It's taboo.

349
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:35,783
I hope the genies
get pissed off.

350
00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:36,884
God's sake, David.

351
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:39,720
Oh, I hate all this ethnic
pretense and affectation.

352
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:41,022
You can treat people decently

353
00:23:41,055 --> 00:23:43,057
without rolling their carpets
out everywhere.

354
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,090
Bloody kitsch.

355
00:23:45,893 --> 00:23:47,494
A drink drink? Mm.

356
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:51,198
Hot chocolate's good. Yum.

357
00:23:54,969 --> 00:23:56,971
I don't like the sound
of those dogs.

358
00:23:57,004 --> 00:23:58,205
They should drive them off.

359
00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:00,517
I think they're wild camels.
I heard one of the staff say...

360
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,777
Staff? Servants, you mean?

361
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,477
Oh, whatever.

362
00:24:04,512 --> 00:24:06,714
They should still
drive them off.

363
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:07,747
Camels bite.

364
00:24:09,617 --> 00:24:11,519
I hear they do.

365
00:24:11,552 --> 00:24:13,187
They like to bite people
in the stomach.

366
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,823
It's the leading cause
of death among the Arabs.

367
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:17,858
The police will do nothing.

368
00:24:17,892 --> 00:24:19,827
And what do you expect them
to do?

369
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,930
I heard one of the boys saying
his legs were pulped.

370
00:24:25,766 --> 00:24:27,101
The dead man.
Pulped?

371
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:29,837
They didn't just hit him.

372
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,640
They run over him.
Maybe more than once.

373
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:34,508
Bullshit.

374
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:36,510
What do they call it
in your country?

375
00:24:36,544 --> 00:24:38,846
- They have a word for it?
- Roadkill.

376
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:40,648
I think we should
get some sleep.

377
00:24:40,681 --> 00:24:42,083
Why?

378
00:24:42,683 --> 00:24:44,952
I'm loosening up finally.

379
00:24:44,986 --> 00:24:46,196
The sun's gonna be up
in a few hours

380
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,089
and I want to sleep it off.

381
00:24:48,122 --> 00:24:50,691
They won't come back.
The police.

382
00:24:54,028 --> 00:24:57,565
- Did Richard bribe them?
- Yeah, possibly.

383
00:24:57,598 --> 00:24:59,038
It's actually a huge
hassle for them.

384
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:00,701
So much paperwork involved.

385
00:25:03,104 --> 00:25:05,206
- And, I hate to say it...
- No, you don't.

386
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:09,610
I hate to say it,
but the kid is a nobody.

387
00:25:10,745 --> 00:25:13,714
He's from a village far away
and no one knows who he is.

388
00:25:16,851 --> 00:25:18,586
No ID, no witnesses.

389
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,790
So, that's that.

390
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:26,861
That's that.

391
00:25:44,712 --> 00:25:46,747
Where the fuck am I?

392
00:26:44,004 --> 00:26:45,004
Morning.

393
00:26:54,982 --> 00:26:57,818
- You forgot the honey.
- Madam?

394
00:26:59,854 --> 00:27:01,088
Never mind.

395
00:27:01,422 --> 00:27:03,290
Do you have any idea
where my husband is?

396
00:27:03,324 --> 00:27:04,358
Horse riding.

397
00:27:08,796 --> 00:27:10,164
Horse riding.

398
00:27:10,197 --> 00:27:13,801
Have I told you how much
I admire your boots, ladies?

399
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:15,936
They give one something
to grab hold of, don't they?

400
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,738
Given half a chance.

401
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:19,840
Have I told you
how loathsome I find you,

402
00:27:19,874 --> 00:27:22,343
- monsieur Henninger?
- You didn't mention it, no.

403
00:27:22,376 --> 00:27:24,845
And please call me David
if you're going to insult me.

404
00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:27,815
I'd slap your bottom for you,
but I know you'd just enjoy it.

405
00:27:27,848 --> 00:27:29,850
I certainly would.

406
00:27:29,884 --> 00:27:32,186
I must say I'm enjoying
this little threesome immensely.

407
00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:47,835
Very picturesque, I suppose,
in a banal sort of way.

408
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,106
Why did Richard
and Dally come here?

409
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:53,807
Gays have always come
to North Africa.

410
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:56,143
Usually to bugger
little Arab boys.

411
00:27:56,177 --> 00:27:58,155
- It's an Edwardian tradition.
<i>- Mon dieu</i>.

412
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:00,147
That is such
an offensive thing to say.

413
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:01,715
Interesting.
You said it was offensive,

414
00:28:01,749 --> 00:28:02,917
not that it wasn't true.

415
00:28:04,418 --> 00:28:06,353
I thought Richard
was a friend of yours.

416
00:28:06,387 --> 00:28:09,123
He is.
I was speaking historically.

417
00:28:09,156 --> 00:28:11,158
Oscar Wilde, André Gide,

418
00:28:11,192 --> 00:28:14,128
Joe Or ton, Allen Ginsberg,
William Burroughs...

419
00:28:14,161 --> 00:28:17,932
I mean, I could go on and on.
Pederasts. The lot of them.

420
00:28:21,402 --> 00:28:23,370
You're a real shit-stirrer,
aren't you, David?

421
00:28:23,404 --> 00:28:25,406
Well, it passes the time

422
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:27,741
in an increasingly
tedious world.

423
00:28:27,775 --> 00:28:29,176
I was saying to Richard...

424
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,845
Fuck! Little shit.

425
00:28:33,948 --> 00:28:36,283
Oh, my God.

426
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:55,134
Nice hat.

427
00:28:57,037 --> 00:28:58,339
Got it in Casablanca.

428
00:29:00,174 --> 00:29:01,175
"Made in China."

429
00:29:02,243 --> 00:29:03,563
What were you doing
in Casablanca?

430
00:29:04,812 --> 00:29:06,380
I was playing ping-pong
with a hooker

431
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:07,948
at the Tahiti hotel.

432
00:29:10,518 --> 00:29:12,520
I've heard about
that kind of ping-pong.

433
00:29:12,554 --> 00:29:15,022
Hookers find me irresistible.
Wanna know why?

434
00:29:15,055 --> 00:29:16,991
You smell of money?

435
00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:19,393
Did she do anal?

436
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:22,062
What's the point of a hooker
if she doesn't do anal?

437
00:29:22,096 --> 00:29:23,816
I'm going to tell your mother
you said that.

438
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:27,134
My mother would be fascinated.

439
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:28,869
- Have you been here before?
- Mm-mm.

440
00:29:28,902 --> 00:29:32,306
We never get away.
David works all the time.

441
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:34,375
His patients
are all rich old bags

442
00:29:34,408 --> 00:29:37,144
who harass him mercilessly
around the clock.

443
00:29:37,177 --> 00:29:40,047
This is a strange place
for a holiday home.

444
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,992
It's like they're living out
some kind of fantasy,

445
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,485
- I guess.
- I like it here.

446
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:47,087
It feels like a country
where useless men can be happy.

447
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:50,057
And are you a useless man?

448
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:52,326
I follow the way of the Buddha.

449
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:57,307
It's good to know that
there are other useless people

450
00:29:57,331 --> 00:29:58,331
in this world.

451
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,901
Besides me.

452
00:30:05,372 --> 00:30:06,532
We should get out of the sun.

453
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:11,912
- Before we start to bleed.
- I don't bleed very easily.

454
00:30:15,015 --> 00:30:17,951
We were riding the trail
and they were waiting for us.

455
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:19,019
Could have been nasty.

456
00:30:19,053 --> 00:30:22,022
Could have been nasty?
It was nasty, little cunt.

457
00:30:22,056 --> 00:30:24,124
I've always said
they were an irrational people.

458
00:30:24,158 --> 00:30:25,268
Didn't like seeing me
on the horse,

459
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:27,094
I expect.
Thought I was enjoying myself.

460
00:30:27,127 --> 00:30:29,997
- Mm-hm. Weren't you?
- That's not the point.

461
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:33,367
Is it against the law to unwind

462
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,169
after a traumatic event?

463
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,370
Here.

464
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:44,945
Some kids from the other side
of the valley, apparently.

465
00:30:44,978 --> 00:30:46,146
Everyone's heard about it.

466
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:48,916
Heard about what?

467
00:30:48,949 --> 00:30:50,618
The accident, what do you think?

468
00:30:50,652 --> 00:30:51,885
Give it here.

469
00:30:53,688 --> 00:30:55,422
They're insatiable gossips.

470
00:30:56,658 --> 00:30:58,959
It's a function
of being illiterate.

471
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:03,130
What a nice little fascist
you've become

472
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:05,466
since being hit by a stone.

473
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:09,069
- Is that all it takes?
- They could have blinded me.

474
00:31:09,103 --> 00:31:10,503
I could have been
bloody disfigured.

475
00:31:13,508 --> 00:31:14,748
They're heading this way.

476
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:18,445
It's not the police.
Haven't heard from them.

477
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:19,614
Mint suppliers?

478
00:31:19,647 --> 00:31:21,915
They came this morning.

479
00:31:21,949 --> 00:31:24,327
- Maybe someone from the morgue.
- Do they even have morgues?

480
00:31:24,351 --> 00:31:26,329
Don't they just throw the body
in a pit or something?

481
00:31:26,353 --> 00:31:29,957
There's a morgue in Errachidia.
Might be a pick up from them.

482
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,426
I wish you hasn't invited
the Henningers.

483
00:31:32,459 --> 00:31:34,371
What a bore they are
and what a mess they've made.

484
00:31:34,395 --> 00:31:36,163
- Did you see his shoes?
- Are they a bore?

485
00:31:36,196 --> 00:31:37,064
Oh, they're a horrible bore.

486
00:31:37,097 --> 00:31:37,732
I guarantee you
they're the only ones

487
00:31:37,766 --> 00:31:39,266
who don't dress up tonight.

488
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:40,578
They'll claim
they have post traumatic

489
00:31:40,602 --> 00:31:42,580
- stress disorder or something.
- I'm sure it is what they have.

490
00:31:42,604 --> 00:31:44,539
Let's face it, babe. Pirates.

491
00:31:44,572 --> 00:31:46,608
A bit cheesy,
a bit fucking eighties.

492
00:31:46,641 --> 00:31:48,275
You always pooh-pooh my ideas.

493
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:50,578
Hardly keeping
with the aesthetic though.

494
00:31:50,612 --> 00:31:53,347
You always pooh-pooh my ideas.
And they're not just pirates.

495
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,383
They are buccaneers and wenches,
and sexy swashbucklers.

496
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:57,451
All right.

497
00:31:57,484 --> 00:31:58,529
Just as long
as they don't end up

498
00:31:58,553 --> 00:32:00,187
plundering any of my paintings.

499
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,991
You were right
about the Henningers.

500
00:32:04,024 --> 00:32:05,736
We should have invited
the Bainbridges instead.

501
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,095
Yeah, they're generally wacko.

502
00:32:08,128 --> 00:32:09,728
And they don't kill people
on the way up.

503
00:33:06,386 --> 00:33:08,322
The father?

504
00:33:08,355 --> 00:33:09,990
You'll leave him
kneeling there all day?

505
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:14,328
- They are Aït Kebash.
- So...

506
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:17,397
They will try
to extort money from you.

507
00:33:18,065 --> 00:33:20,267
Where do the Aït Kebash live?

508
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,336
Far. Far out.

509
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:24,271
Then they've come a long way.
Open the gate.

510
00:33:24,304 --> 00:33:25,707
They will blackmail you.

511
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,307
The men of the desert
know everything.

512
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:28,819
No, they don't.
They just assume the worst,

513
00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:30,603
which makes them right
nine times out of ten.

514
00:34:56,631 --> 00:34:57,732
What.

515
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,400
He said the Englishman must pay.

516
00:35:03,538 --> 00:35:04,606
Fuck that.

517
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,475
Pay the old crow.
Make him go away.

518
00:35:08,509 --> 00:35:10,588
You don't pay someone for
an accident, for fuck's sake.

519
00:35:10,612 --> 00:35:12,245
You don't even know
how much he wants.

520
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:13,319
Might just be 1,000 Euros.

521
00:35:13,347 --> 00:35:15,291
- Or a fuck of a lot more.
- That's nothing for us.

522
00:35:15,315 --> 00:35:17,484
- It's blackmail.
- So what if it is?

523
00:35:17,518 --> 00:35:19,621
What's the word for blackmail
in their language?

524
00:35:19,654 --> 00:35:21,188
If they even have one.

525
00:35:21,221 --> 00:35:23,256
You think villages in the Sahara
are living in shit

526
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:23,958
in the same way we do?

527
00:35:23,992 --> 00:35:25,627
It's the principle of the thing.

528
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,328
It's the principle of the thing
plus 1,000 Euros.

529
00:35:28,362 --> 00:35:29,831
That seems like
a pretty good deal

530
00:35:29,864 --> 00:35:31,164
for the cost of a life.

531
00:35:31,198 --> 00:35:32,634
Not when I'm being robbed.

532
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:34,636
You're not being robbed.
You're being spared.

533
00:35:34,669 --> 00:35:36,771
Why? What are they going
to do to me?

534
00:35:36,804 --> 00:35:39,641
Lynch me?
Public castration?

535
00:35:39,674 --> 00:35:41,843
I wasn't thinking
about them lynching you.

536
00:35:41,876 --> 00:35:43,921
And I wasn't thinking about them
cutting off your cock.

537
00:35:43,945 --> 00:35:45,647
I was thinking about them
not going away.

538
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,382
Of course,
your precious weekend.

539
00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:50,283
Must not forget
your bloody party.

540
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:53,186
What about contacting
the consulate in Casablanca?

541
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,187
I don't think
you're really considering

542
00:35:54,221 --> 00:35:55,757
your own best interests.

543
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,725
If we contact the consulate,
there'd have to be

544
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:58,836
a thorough look
at this whole thing.

545
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,562
And I mean thorough.

546
00:36:01,596 --> 00:36:03,540
- I don't think you want that.
- I would welcome the consulate...

547
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:06,466
No, David.
I don't think you would.

548
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,941
- Fine, I'll go.
- No.

549
00:36:13,975 --> 00:36:14,909
I would like to pay
my respects anyway.

550
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:17,979
No. That is absolutely
out of the question.

551
00:36:18,012 --> 00:36:19,814
You know how these people are.

552
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:21,916
It'd make things
so much more awkward.

553
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:24,418
Well, we wouldn't want
to make things awkward.

554
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:40,233
I see Lord Swanthorne's arrived.

555
00:36:42,704 --> 00:36:45,673
- Do you know him?
- From the club.

556
00:36:45,707 --> 00:36:47,942
Perfect parasite,
but amusing in his way.

557
00:36:54,414 --> 00:36:55,516
So, how's the practice?

558
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,685
- Not too good.
- Huh.

559
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:00,555
Bit of a dearth of skin cancers
in London at the moment.

560
00:37:00,588 --> 00:37:04,625
I was sued by a patient.
Old woman in Chiswick.

561
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:06,326
Cost me an arm and a leg.

562
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:08,963
- Oh, dear. I didn't hear.
- No, you didn't.

563
00:37:09,997 --> 00:37:11,666
It's my life.
If it goes wrong,

564
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:13,333
I'd rather it went wrong
in private.

565
00:37:14,102 --> 00:37:16,938
- What happened?
- Forensic fuck-up.

566
00:37:16,971 --> 00:37:18,906
Didn't spot the tumours
for what they were.

567
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:22,844
Human error.

568
00:37:22,877 --> 00:37:26,013
- And the old woman...
- She's dying.

569
00:37:26,047 --> 00:37:28,448
Ah, sorry.

570
00:37:28,482 --> 00:37:30,162
So, it cost her an arm
and a leg too, then.

571
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,668
The old boy probably
won't know any English.

572
00:37:47,702 --> 00:37:48,746
You speak French, don't you?

573
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,738
Of course,
I speak fucking French.

574
00:37:59,346 --> 00:38:00,586
You sure you're ready for this?

575
00:38:10,124 --> 00:38:11,458
After you.

576
00:38:37,618 --> 00:38:39,352
He says he will speak to me.

577
00:38:39,386 --> 00:38:40,922
Perhaps because
you're not believers.

578
00:38:40,955 --> 00:38:43,390
- Oh, here we go.
- No, it's fine.

579
00:38:43,423 --> 00:38:44,491
Go ahead.

580
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:20,695
He wants you to return with them
to bury the boy.

581
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:24,098
What the fuck?

582
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:26,100
And if you are a man of hon our,
you will do it.

583
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:27,668
It is customary in these parts.

584
00:39:27,702 --> 00:39:29,871
Is it customary in these parts?

585
00:39:29,904 --> 00:39:32,874
These are not the people I know.
They're Berber.

586
00:39:32,907 --> 00:39:35,676
If they say it is their custom,
I have to believe them.

587
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,545
Did he did mention money?

588
00:39:37,578 --> 00:39:40,480
No, but it will be understood.
We don't speak of such things.

589
00:39:40,514 --> 00:39:44,018
- David has to know the amount.
- I cannot ask him that.

590
00:39:45,686 --> 00:39:46,897
Monsieur David just has to take
a certain amount with him.

591
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:50,091
Monsieur David
hasn't agreed to this absurd plan.

592
00:39:50,124 --> 00:39:53,194
Go back with him to his village?
Are you bonkers?

593
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:54,929
It may be
you don't have a choice.

594
00:39:56,496 --> 00:39:57,798
He's not entirely asking you.

595
00:39:57,832 --> 00:40:01,102
He's being polite,
but I think he will insist.

596
00:40:01,135 --> 00:40:02,546
Going back to their village
for a night

597
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,638
and paying your respects

598
00:40:03,671 --> 00:40:05,806
would be a bloody sight
easier than anything else.

599
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,084
You'll be back
in a couple of days.

600
00:40:07,108 --> 00:40:08,075
Has it occurred to you, Dicky,

601
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:10,044
that he might actually
be planning something

602
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:13,047
a lot nastier than anything
you can anticipate

603
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,550
since he thinks I bunked off
his fucking kid and all that?

604
00:40:16,584 --> 00:40:19,153
- You're exaggerating, monsieur.
- Am I? Am I really?

605
00:40:19,186 --> 00:40:22,156
Yeah. Yeah, you are.
They won't pull any stunts.

606
00:40:22,189 --> 00:40:23,791
They're afraid
of the Moroccan police.

607
00:40:23,824 --> 00:40:26,060
Well they might be fucking ISIS
for all I know.

608
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,932
Are you this paranoid
all the time?

609
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:35,102
I don't hear
you volunteering, Yank.

610
00:40:35,136 --> 00:40:36,604
That's because
I didn't kill him.

611
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:37,939
Well I didn't fucking kill him.

612
00:40:37,972 --> 00:40:39,116
He just stepped out
in front of me.

613
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,076
- His name was Driss.
- Yes, I...

614
00:40:44,745 --> 00:40:48,149
Driss. Driss, right.

615
00:41:04,532 --> 00:41:07,601
What does it
matter? One way or the other,

616
00:41:07,635 --> 00:41:09,837
everyone thinks
I'm guilty anyway.

617
00:41:16,711 --> 00:41:18,913
What a jolly weekend
this has turned out to be.

618
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:49,909
How'd it go?

619
00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:54,815
Dicky and the Arab servant

620
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:58,119
have cooked up
a perfectly wonderful wease.

621
00:41:58,152 --> 00:42:00,621
I'm to go back
with the old geezer

622
00:42:00,654 --> 00:42:01,622
to his village

623
00:42:01,655 --> 00:42:04,725
in the middle of nowhere
and do some atonement.

624
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:06,236
Fuck that. They could be ISIS
for all we know.

625
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:10,064
That's what I said.
Didn't go down too well.

626
00:42:10,097 --> 00:42:12,767
- Had to smooth things over.
- What'd you say?

627
00:42:17,004 --> 00:42:18,539
I agreed to go.

628
00:42:22,243 --> 00:42:24,612
Everyone seems to think
it's the only thing to do.

629
00:42:25,946 --> 00:42:27,226
And I imagine
it might get nasty.

630
00:42:32,153 --> 00:42:36,123
- How was he, the father?
- Inscrutable.

631
00:42:36,157 --> 00:42:37,925
And it's just you
that has to go?

632
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:39,226
Just me.

633
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,094
They're probably worried

634
00:42:40,127 --> 00:42:42,029
you'll get your period
or something.

635
00:42:42,063 --> 00:42:43,898
The man just lost
his son, David.

636
00:42:43,931 --> 00:42:45,599
I'm sure
that they have their rituals

637
00:42:45,633 --> 00:42:47,234
just like everyone else.

638
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:48,936
Maybe it's a good idea.

639
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,806
We don't want the police
showing up again,

640
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,274
poking their noses
into everything.

641
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:56,710
No, I suppose we don't.

642
00:42:57,546 --> 00:43:00,681
May I remind you, Jo,
you got into a car with a drunk,

643
00:43:00,714 --> 00:43:03,350
which makes you an accessory
before and after the fact.

644
00:43:03,384 --> 00:43:04,952
Funny that.

645
00:43:04,985 --> 00:43:07,188
Like I've been an accessory
for a long time now.

646
00:43:15,996 --> 00:43:17,374
I'm sure
Richard wouldn't let you go

647
00:43:17,398 --> 00:43:18,632
if there was a risk.

648
00:43:19,867 --> 00:43:22,770
It'll be fine.
A little jolly in the desert.

649
00:43:22,803 --> 00:43:24,972
Might even enjoy myself,
who knows?

650
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:29,376
Probably just wants closure,
that's all.

651
00:43:31,112 --> 00:43:32,880
That's what people
always want these days.

652
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:35,950
It's like being
on fucking Oprah.

653
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,228
A bit of an outdated
reference, Oprah.

654
00:43:38,252 --> 00:43:41,155
Was it? Oh, I'm sorry.
I do apologize.

655
00:43:41,188 --> 00:43:43,424
You know, that that's what
he wants, right? The father.

656
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:46,760
He wants you to apologize,
to say that you're sorry.

657
00:43:46,794 --> 00:43:48,796
Well, I'll say I'm sorry.

658
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:52,800
- Are you sorry?
- I will say I'm sorry.

659
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:13,899
Oh, shit. I forgot about...

660
00:44:25,332 --> 00:44:26,767
Oops.

661
00:45:01,402 --> 00:45:03,170
What's in the bag?

662
00:45:03,204 --> 00:45:05,239
Clean shirt, clean socks,
clean underwear.

663
00:45:05,272 --> 00:45:07,908
I feel like I'm being packed off
to boarding school.

664
00:45:07,942 --> 00:45:10,177
Probably going to need
the clean underwear.

665
00:45:10,211 --> 00:45:12,446
Oh, the rent boy made a joke.

666
00:45:12,479 --> 00:45:16,450
- Now, now. Cash?
- A thousand Euros.

667
00:45:16,483 --> 00:45:17,918
That's all they're getting.

668
00:45:20,555 --> 00:45:22,489
Take care out there, stumblebum.

669
00:45:32,433 --> 00:45:36,303
Right. Remember, David,
you can't show fear

670
00:45:36,337 --> 00:45:38,038
or discomfort in front
of these people.

671
00:45:38,072 --> 00:45:39,416
You have to show indifference
to both.

672
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,108
I'll try to bear that in mind.

673
00:45:41,141 --> 00:45:43,777
I expect one of them will
give you a ride back afterwards.

674
00:45:43,811 --> 00:45:46,013
If not, give us a call
and we'll figure something out.

675
00:45:46,046 --> 00:45:47,948
You've got your mobile?

676
00:45:47,982 --> 00:45:49,917
- Will it work out there?
- Of course it will.

677
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:06,033
Let me know you're all right.

678
00:46:09,169 --> 00:46:10,337
Good luck, old man.

679
00:46:19,547 --> 00:46:21,482
Poor sod.

680
00:46:21,516 --> 00:46:23,150
It'll be a difficult
couple of days.

681
00:46:24,018 --> 00:46:25,819
It'll certainly be
an experience for him.

682
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:29,023
I'll call in a couple of hours.

683
00:46:29,056 --> 00:46:30,924
Make sure
they haven't raped him.

684
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:33,260
- Richard...
- Kidding.

685
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:38,198
- What?
- You're terrible.

686
00:47:01,121 --> 00:47:02,323
Would you like a cigarette?

687
00:47:05,192 --> 00:47:09,163
- French. Not Moroccan shit.
- No, no. Thank you.

688
00:47:25,946 --> 00:47:27,226
Your wife is very pretty.

689
00:47:31,118 --> 00:47:33,087
I will have a gazelle
like that one day.

690
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,120
InshaAllah!

691
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:15,362
- You don't look like a pirate.
- I'm supposed to be Dionysus.

692
00:48:15,396 --> 00:48:17,431
None of these illiterates
even know who that is.

693
00:48:17,464 --> 00:48:19,466
God of drink and drugs
and madness.

694
00:48:21,001 --> 00:48:22,403
Then I've an audience of one.

695
00:48:24,204 --> 00:48:26,006
What else should I know?

696
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:29,143
He was once kidnapped
by pirates, hence the reference.

697
00:48:29,176 --> 00:48:30,545
A cult grew up around him.

698
00:48:30,578 --> 00:48:32,680
His followers
were said to be cannibals.

699
00:48:32,714 --> 00:48:35,082
They symbolically ate his flesh
and drank his blood.

700
00:48:35,115 --> 00:48:35,949
No, I'm pretty sure
you're thinking

701
00:48:35,983 --> 00:48:37,463
of Roman Catholics.

702
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,455
Shouldn't you be wearing a toga?

703
00:48:42,757 --> 00:48:44,401
There's getting
into the spirit of the thing

704
00:48:44,425 --> 00:48:46,226
and then there's going too far.

705
00:48:47,394 --> 00:48:49,296
The pirate costume
didn't suit me anyway.

706
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:50,532
I looked like Johnny Depp.

707
00:48:52,634 --> 00:48:53,434
Much more handsome,

708
00:48:53,467 --> 00:48:56,604
less bloated Johnny Depp,
obviously.

709
00:48:56,638 --> 00:48:57,938
Obviously.

710
00:48:59,574 --> 00:49:01,576
You're a writer,
Dicky was saying?

711
00:49:01,609 --> 00:49:03,110
Not sure about that anymore.

712
00:49:03,143 --> 00:49:06,146
I haven't written a word
in eight years

713
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,182
and all of my books
have been forgotten

714
00:49:08,215 --> 00:49:10,685
by the world's
feckless children.

715
00:49:10,718 --> 00:49:14,154
- And that doesn't bother you?
- It's a relief.

716
00:49:16,423 --> 00:49:19,126
I guess every artistic career

717
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:20,528
has a few moments of visibility,

718
00:49:20,562 --> 00:49:22,229
followed by a long,
painful descent

719
00:49:22,262 --> 00:49:24,331
into total anonymity.

720
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,502
I'm sure some feckless child
of the future will pick up

721
00:49:28,536 --> 00:49:31,472
one of your books
and rescue you from oblivion.

722
00:49:31,506 --> 00:49:32,683
No one's going to be
reading books in 50 years,

723
00:49:32,707 --> 00:49:34,475
let alone a thousand.

724
00:49:34,509 --> 00:49:37,545
And the children of the future
will all be empty headed clowns,

725
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:40,180
just like the children
of the present.

726
00:49:40,214 --> 00:49:42,684
Oh, I'm going to go out
on a limb

727
00:49:42,717 --> 00:49:44,184
and assume
you don't have any kids.

728
00:49:52,527 --> 00:49:55,462
What about you,
not about kids, your work?

729
00:49:55,496 --> 00:49:56,731
Ugh.

730
00:49:58,666 --> 00:50:00,267
Financial analyst.

731
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:07,307
What does a financial analyst
actually do

732
00:50:07,341 --> 00:50:08,776
if they actually do anything?

733
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:10,778
We buy, we sell...

734
00:50:10,812 --> 00:50:12,479
And every 10 years or so,

735
00:50:12,514 --> 00:50:15,282
you get it all
catastrophically wrong.

736
00:50:18,185 --> 00:50:19,587
I guess that's right.

737
00:50:19,621 --> 00:50:21,589
- Sounds like fun.
- It is.

738
00:50:39,473 --> 00:50:41,241
We are nearing Erfoud,

739
00:50:41,275 --> 00:50:43,811
the largest oasis
in North Africa.

740
00:50:43,845 --> 00:50:46,313
From here come
the royal family of Morocco.

741
00:50:46,346 --> 00:50:49,182
I'm a big fan of royalty,
I always have been.

742
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:52,319
Prince Andrew,
Mohammed bin Sal man,

743
00:50:52,352 --> 00:50:54,054
wonderful people.

744
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:58,726
He says we will go to the hotel.

745
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,161
No one can drive
across to Alnif in the dark.

746
00:51:02,262 --> 00:51:03,698
I'll take your word for it.

747
00:51:19,847 --> 00:51:22,316
Come on, bunny.
Don't worry, he'll be alright.

748
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:25,419
He's probably having a joint
with the Ait Kebash as we speak.

749
00:51:25,452 --> 00:51:27,765
They're incorrigible potheads.
He'll be stoned the whole time.

750
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:29,156
Easy for you to say.

751
00:51:29,189 --> 00:51:30,825
You're not being driven
into the desert

752
00:51:30,858 --> 00:51:32,560
to a place
that you can't pronounce.

753
00:51:32,594 --> 00:51:34,261
Do you know where it is
on the map?

754
00:51:34,294 --> 00:51:36,396
I don't care
where it is on the map.

755
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:39,099
Fuck him anyway,
ruined my night.

756
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:41,468
Don't sulk, sweetie.

757
00:51:41,501 --> 00:51:42,913
We'll have a good ol'
fashioned blowout tomorrow

758
00:51:42,937 --> 00:51:44,471
to make up for it.

759
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,742
You know the school
David and I went to,

760
00:51:47,775 --> 00:51:49,276
there was a story
that did the rounds,

761
00:51:49,309 --> 00:51:51,478
bedroom incident
on Parents' Day.

762
00:51:51,512 --> 00:51:53,681
One of the boys started
throwing mice

763
00:51:53,715 --> 00:51:56,383
off the roof top
of the masters down below.

764
00:51:56,416 --> 00:51:59,587
But each mouse was equipped
with a little parachute

765
00:51:59,621 --> 00:52:02,690
decorated with a swastika.

766
00:52:02,724 --> 00:52:06,159
Parachutes didn't work,
obviously.

767
00:52:06,193 --> 00:52:07,829
Poor mice hurtled
to their deaths

768
00:52:07,862 --> 00:52:08,896
against the flagstones

769
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:10,698
with the swastikas
draped over them.

770
00:52:11,866 --> 00:52:14,167
That's terrible.

771
00:52:14,201 --> 00:52:15,903
Why would someone do
something like that?

772
00:52:15,937 --> 00:52:17,280
Children aren't really
that well-versed

773
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:19,172
in the principles
of aerodynamics.

774
00:52:19,206 --> 00:52:20,808
No, I mean the swastikas.

775
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:25,546
Kid was probably vilifying
the masters as Nazi types.

776
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:27,247
Or he just liked swastikas.

777
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,652
Story was it was David
who did it.

778
00:52:32,452 --> 00:52:36,891
- No, is that true?
- I couldn't say for sure.

779
00:52:36,924 --> 00:52:38,392
Before my time.

780
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,529
But I heard they caned him
for it anyway.

781
00:52:41,562 --> 00:52:42,830
Beat him black and blue.

782
00:52:50,337 --> 00:52:52,372
Now, listen, are you going
to mope all weekend

783
00:52:52,406 --> 00:52:54,441
or are you going
to enjoy yourself?

784
00:52:54,474 --> 00:52:56,511
It's not a crime
to enjoy yourself, you know?

785
00:53:02,784 --> 00:53:04,686
I suppose I can make the effort.

786
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:06,420
Attagirl!

787
00:54:11,786 --> 00:54:13,487
What are you doing?

788
00:54:13,521 --> 00:54:16,724
It is more fitting.
Please, I'm sure you understand.

789
00:54:19,392 --> 00:54:20,928
I will order your Coke.

790
00:54:20,962 --> 00:54:23,064
There is a room upstairs
where you can sleep.

791
00:54:23,097 --> 00:54:25,666
We rise again at five.
I will come for you.

792
00:55:13,881 --> 00:55:16,617
<i>The
person you have dialled cannot be reached.</i>

793
00:55:18,653 --> 00:55:19,887
Bloody knew it.

794
00:55:25,026 --> 00:55:26,761
<i>Everyone is alive right now.</i>

795
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:30,865
<i>Everyone's made it this far.</i>

796
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:34,001
<i>We've all done the worse
kinds of things...</i>

797
00:55:34,035 --> 00:55:35,035
<i>Liar.</i>

798
00:55:37,972 --> 00:55:39,740
Oh, Christ.

799
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,683
Oh, I heard there was
an accident last night.

800
00:55:48,716 --> 00:55:50,117
Was somebody hurt?

801
00:55:50,151 --> 00:55:52,854
Friend of mine from London
got lost on the road,

802
00:55:52,887 --> 00:55:54,722
David Henninger.

803
00:55:54,755 --> 00:55:58,860
Oh, that's who that was.
Thought I recognized him.

804
00:55:58,893 --> 00:56:01,562
One of the Arabs
stepped out in front of him.

805
00:56:03,664 --> 00:56:05,132
Kaput.

806
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:06,667
Where's Henninger now?

807
00:56:06,701 --> 00:56:08,736
Oh, he sent him
into the desert to die.

808
00:56:11,072 --> 00:56:13,841
- Did you sleep?
- Eventually.

809
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:15,176
Did you dream?

810
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:19,446
No. I mean, I...
I can't remember.

811
00:56:20,982 --> 00:56:23,851
- I had a very strange dream.
- Oh yeah?

812
00:56:23,885 --> 00:56:26,453
I dreamed I was...
I was a butterfly.

813
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:30,925
How do you know
that you are not a butterfly...

814
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,095
dreaming that you are a man?

815
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:38,699
- Hmm I like that.
- Well, it's not one of mine.

816
00:56:38,733 --> 00:56:40,835
Chinese fellow said it.

817
00:57:19,173 --> 00:57:20,541
Yes?

818
00:57:20,574 --> 00:57:23,144
Madame. Monsieur Day
has sent you a card.

819
00:57:23,177 --> 00:57:25,046
You can leave it on the table.

820
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:27,515
Monsieur Day says
I must wait for a reply.

821
00:57:29,517 --> 00:57:31,819
- You serious?
- Yes, madame.

822
00:57:34,689 --> 00:57:36,190
You can call me mademoiselle.

823
00:57:51,806 --> 00:57:55,977
Papayas for breakfast,
how the hell do they do it?

824
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:58,088
No point in having contacts
in the Ministry of Interior

825
00:57:58,112 --> 00:57:59,947
if you can't get a fresh papaya.

826
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:04,251
- What happened to the raw egg?
- Couldn't stomach it.

827
00:58:06,087 --> 00:58:07,221
Boosts your libido.

828
00:58:08,289 --> 00:58:10,725
My libido's fine,
Mrs. Henninger.

829
00:58:13,294 --> 00:58:16,731
There's a picnic today.
We should go.

830
00:58:19,734 --> 00:58:21,702
We should go?

831
00:58:21,736 --> 00:58:24,005
Heard your husband's gone AWOL.

832
00:58:24,038 --> 00:58:27,875
I'm just offering my services
as an... escort.

833
00:58:29,043 --> 00:58:31,112
How very gallant of you.

834
00:58:31,379 --> 00:58:33,047
It's an oasis somewhere.

835
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,982
Maybe there'd be a waterfall.

836
00:58:35,016 --> 00:58:36,717
Everyone likes waterfalls.

837
00:58:36,751 --> 00:58:39,320
And this would involve swimming,
I assume?

838
00:58:39,353 --> 00:58:41,122
Hope so.

839
00:58:41,155 --> 00:58:43,657
The voyeurs among us
want to see you in a swimsuit.

840
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,061
Not very subtle.

841
00:58:47,995 --> 00:58:50,297
I'm from New York,
subtly gets you fined there.

842
00:58:52,767 --> 00:58:56,170
I won't fine you, maybe a little
corporal punishment.

843
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:57,905
Corporal punishment?

844
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:04,245
Now I'm beginning to feel
a vague stirring of interest.

845
00:59:04,278 --> 00:59:06,614
Vague, stirring,
vague, stirring?

846
00:59:08,082 --> 00:59:09,192
I need something
a little more concrete

847
00:59:09,216 --> 00:59:10,351
than vague stirring.

848
00:59:10,384 --> 00:59:12,686
I'll talk to my people.
They'll talk to their people.

849
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,889
We'll get back to you.

850
00:59:14,922 --> 00:59:18,125
And there I was hoping
for a hostile takeover.

851
01:00:53,721 --> 01:00:55,055
As-salamu alaykum!

852
01:01:07,401 --> 01:01:10,871
Oh. Orthoceras.

853
01:01:32,226 --> 01:01:35,362
He says you cannot drink
from the same cup.

854
01:01:35,863 --> 01:01:38,866
You cannot eat
from the same plate.

855
01:01:38,899 --> 01:01:40,801
He says your shadow
must not cross.

856
01:01:42,136 --> 01:01:46,340
- Is that a custom?
- No, just his way right now.

857
01:01:47,474 --> 01:01:50,311
- It will pass.
- Alright.

858
01:02:00,487 --> 01:02:02,327
It has been
sent all the way to Norway.

859
01:02:03,224 --> 01:02:04,925
Coffee table.

860
01:02:04,959 --> 01:02:06,493
It is incredible
that wealthy men

861
01:02:06,528 --> 01:02:07,995
collect such things.

862
01:02:08,028 --> 01:02:10,898
Wealthy men collect
a lot of stupid bullshit.

863
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,477
The renovation
of a single bathroom

864
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:16,937
can keep a Saharan village
alive for a year.

865
01:02:18,405 --> 01:02:22,009
The desert is what we fish,
and the fossils are our fish.

866
01:02:25,246 --> 01:02:28,849
It is a joke.
God has played a joke on us.

867
01:02:30,384 --> 01:02:33,320
- Does it make you laugh?
- No, not at all.

868
01:02:33,354 --> 01:02:34,989
- Makes you laugh?
- No.

869
01:02:35,022 --> 01:02:36,156
Makes me laugh.

870
01:02:37,525 --> 01:02:39,159
Soon there will be nothing here.

871
01:02:40,828 --> 01:02:43,264
No people, no trees.
We are the last ones.

872
01:02:44,064 --> 01:02:47,368
We have fossils
and our children.

873
01:02:48,536 --> 01:02:50,037
And nothing else.

874
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:18,198
ISIS control this part
of the desert.

875
01:03:18,232 --> 01:03:21,168
That's very encouraging to hear.

876
01:03:21,201 --> 01:03:22,970
Marvellous.

877
01:03:23,003 --> 01:03:25,139
We will drive around Issomour
to arrive to Tafal'aalt.

878
01:03:25,172 --> 01:03:27,509
- It is the back way.
- Why the back way?

879
01:03:28,643 --> 01:03:30,944
It's the old man's choice.

880
01:03:30,978 --> 01:03:33,147
So, it'll add hours to the trip.

881
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:35,349
No, I wouldn't say so long.

882
01:03:35,382 --> 01:03:36,884
We should be there soon enough.

883
01:03:39,019 --> 01:03:40,555
Why are you looking
at your watch?

884
01:03:42,156 --> 01:03:43,924
I don't know.

885
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,301
What?

886
01:03:55,537 --> 01:03:57,171
It was his only son.

887
01:03:58,238 --> 01:03:59,940
It was his only child.

888
01:04:03,043 --> 01:04:06,947
Well... the world
is a dreadful place,

889
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,349
my father used to say.

890
01:04:10,451 --> 01:04:14,455
And the best you can do
is make fun of it.

891
01:04:18,459 --> 01:04:21,529
Here's my best Buster Keaton.

892
01:04:21,563 --> 01:04:23,641
Here's when he's young...

893
01:04:23,665 --> 01:04:26,634
Here's when he's old.
See the difference?

894
01:04:27,702 --> 01:04:29,303
They say you throw
the best parties

895
01:04:29,336 --> 01:04:31,338
- east of Marrakesh.
- Correction.

896
01:04:31,372 --> 01:04:34,007
The best parties
in the whole North Africa.

897
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:36,310
- Is that good?
- I got it.

898
01:04:36,343 --> 01:04:39,012
Dally. Could you get
everybody moving?

899
01:04:39,046 --> 01:04:41,448
Quicker we get there the better.
It's too bloody hot.

900
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:46,530
- Oasis time.
- Dicky.

901
01:04:46,554 --> 01:04:47,388
Darling.

902
01:04:47,421 --> 01:04:48,666
As I live and breathe.

903
01:07:17,204 --> 01:07:19,273
You know,
Dally and I come down here

904
01:07:19,306 --> 01:07:21,609
nearly every day,
and every time I remember

905
01:07:21,643 --> 01:07:23,419
- why I'm not in London.
- Do you sing a song to Pan

906
01:07:23,443 --> 01:07:25,178
as you stroll along?

907
01:07:25,212 --> 01:07:28,282
- And other Gods too.
- Mammon, right? He was a god.

908
01:07:28,315 --> 01:07:31,285
The Phoenicians didn't make it
quite this far west, Tom.

909
01:07:31,318 --> 01:07:35,590
Oh, of course. The Phoenicians.
How stupid of me.

910
01:07:35,623 --> 01:07:38,392
Asshole.

911
01:07:38,425 --> 01:07:40,427
Did I tell you I
have a house in Bali?

912
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:42,329
And you own a
Kandinsky too, right?

913
01:07:43,363 --> 01:07:44,563
It does sound like a line.

914
01:07:45,633 --> 01:07:46,873
What is it you like about Bali?

915
01:07:48,836 --> 01:07:51,573
The hot weather
cheap restaurants.

916
01:07:52,874 --> 01:07:54,709
I thought Mick Jagger
lived there

917
01:07:54,742 --> 01:07:57,377
and then it turned out
he didn't.

918
01:07:57,411 --> 01:08:00,447
- Girlfriend?
- Not in Bali.

919
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,517
I thought all white men
had a girlfriend in Asia.

920
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:03,550
Not me.

921
01:08:04,284 --> 01:08:07,855
Mmm, I'm sure you have
a few sluts on the side.

922
01:08:07,889 --> 01:08:11,224
A little judgmental,
of both me and the sluts.

923
01:08:11,258 --> 01:08:13,493
I'm not judging anyone.
I think men need sluts.

924
01:08:14,562 --> 01:08:16,163
I think women need to be sluts.

925
01:08:17,464 --> 01:08:19,333
They can't seem
to manage otherwise,

926
01:08:19,366 --> 01:08:21,234
except when they're drunk,
of course.

927
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:25,807
Maybe you don't know how to ask.

928
01:08:28,643 --> 01:08:32,279
- Me personally?
- Yeah, you personally.

929
01:08:45,225 --> 01:08:47,194
You've forgotten
about my husband.

930
01:08:47,227 --> 01:08:49,664
- Yes, I have.
- And so have you.

931
01:11:29,857 --> 01:11:31,358
Was that the mother?

932
01:11:31,391 --> 01:11:34,562
No, no.
She died many years ago.

933
01:11:34,595 --> 01:11:36,363
- Aunts and a cousin.
- Hmm.

934
01:11:48,109 --> 01:11:49,911
This is Driss' room.

935
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:53,480
There is no other room
for you to sleep in.

936
01:11:54,615 --> 01:11:56,617
Abdellah want you
to feel his spirit here.

937
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,387
He thinks it is more fitting.

938
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:04,792
I'm going to the burial now.

939
01:12:04,826 --> 01:12:06,861
- Does Abdellah want me to...
- No, no, no.

940
01:12:07,895 --> 01:12:09,931
While I am away you should
keep your door bolted.

941
01:12:09,964 --> 01:12:11,132
What?

942
01:12:11,165 --> 01:12:13,634
The women. Grief.

943
01:14:59,166 --> 01:15:00,568
What have you done?

944
01:15:16,684 --> 01:15:17,952
What the fuck are you doing?

945
01:16:48,109 --> 01:16:49,109
Hungry?

946
01:16:55,116 --> 01:16:57,218
- What meat is this?
- Goat.

947
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:01,989
- It's good.
- Fresh.

948
01:17:02,690 --> 01:17:05,025
Abdellah only killed
the animal an hour ago.

949
01:17:18,339 --> 01:17:21,108
The diggers are returning
from the mountain.

950
01:17:21,142 --> 01:17:22,877
They come back when it's dark,

951
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:25,045
when they can no longer see
what they are doing.

952
01:17:25,079 --> 01:17:27,848
So, they work from dawn to dusk.

953
01:17:29,016 --> 01:17:30,751
It's a nice phrase
until you think

954
01:17:30,784 --> 01:17:32,153
what it actually means.

955
01:17:34,054 --> 01:17:35,990
Why did you agree
to come back here, David?

956
01:17:37,424 --> 01:17:40,027
I don't know, I suppose...

957
01:17:42,429 --> 01:17:44,932
I suppose I wanted
to cross the bridge

958
01:17:46,066 --> 01:17:47,768
and have done with things.

959
01:17:53,374 --> 01:17:55,776
Abdellah will come by soon
to have a talk with you.

960
01:17:58,812 --> 01:18:00,281
Is he coming with a knife?

961
01:18:10,124 --> 01:18:11,792
I haven't done this in years.

962
01:18:11,825 --> 01:18:13,494
This is A-force snow
from Marseilles.

963
01:18:13,528 --> 01:18:15,996
It's a rather boring drug I find.

964
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:18,799
I plowed through heaps of it
with John Paul Getty...

965
01:18:18,832 --> 01:18:22,436
or old one ear
as I liked to call him.

966
01:18:22,469 --> 01:18:25,339
I only do it now
because Maribel insists.

967
01:18:25,372 --> 01:18:27,074
You're such a liar.

968
01:18:28,242 --> 01:18:29,786
You look fucking hot tonight
by the way.

969
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:31,912
That's just the coke talking.

970
01:18:31,946 --> 01:18:34,882
I think it's good you've got
some time to yourself, Jo.

971
01:18:34,915 --> 01:18:36,083
I think you needed it.

972
01:18:36,116 --> 01:18:38,085
It would be great
if I wasn't so worried.

973
01:18:43,057 --> 01:18:44,758
You know
you'll never be accepted here,

974
01:18:44,792 --> 01:18:46,093
don't you, Dicky?

975
01:18:46,126 --> 01:18:48,195
Being an infidel and all.

976
01:18:49,230 --> 01:18:51,031
Why should they accept them?

977
01:18:51,065 --> 01:18:53,000
They have every reason
to hate them.

978
01:18:53,033 --> 01:18:55,078
I'd have thought they'd have
more reason to hate you.

979
01:18:55,102 --> 01:18:57,838
France has excellent relations
with the Arabs.

980
01:18:57,871 --> 01:18:59,974
We share the Mediterranean
with them.

981
01:19:00,007 --> 01:19:02,476
- But you wouldn't understand.
- I understand.

982
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:04,144
You mean you have them
in your ghettos...

983
01:19:04,178 --> 01:19:06,089
so you feel close to them,
but do you feel close to them...

984
01:19:06,113 --> 01:19:08,182
when they're burning cars
in the suburbs

985
01:19:08,215 --> 01:19:09,984
and ransacking your synagogues?

986
01:19:10,017 --> 01:19:12,920
That is just, how do you say,
a probleme social?

987
01:19:12,953 --> 01:19:14,431
No, they dislike you
for the same reason

988
01:19:14,455 --> 01:19:15,856
they dislike us.

989
01:19:15,889 --> 01:19:17,501
We're not Muslims
and we lord it over them.

990
01:19:17,525 --> 01:19:18,892
It's against what they regard

991
01:19:18,926 --> 01:19:20,103
as the natural order of things

992
01:19:20,127 --> 01:19:22,463
which would be
them lording over us.

993
01:19:22,496 --> 01:19:24,532
I don't hold it
against them though.

994
01:19:24,566 --> 01:19:26,200
They're rival imperialists.

995
01:19:26,233 --> 01:19:28,802
But in America, Muslims
are peaceful and prosperous.

996
01:19:28,836 --> 01:19:29,913
They don't spend their time

997
01:19:29,937 --> 01:19:32,239
rioting and pelting police cars
with garbage cans.

998
01:19:32,273 --> 01:19:34,074
How come they only do that
in France?

999
01:19:34,108 --> 01:19:38,846
It must be,
how do you say, solidarité.

1000
01:19:38,879 --> 01:19:41,382
You are killing
hundreds of thousands

1001
01:19:41,415 --> 01:19:44,385
- in Iraq and Afghanistan...
- No, we're not, darling.

1002
01:19:44,418 --> 01:19:46,987
- The Mujahideen are.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1003
01:19:47,021 --> 01:19:48,889
Listen, honey, we understand...

1004
01:19:48,922 --> 01:19:51,158
that when in doubt Americans
must be blamed.

1005
01:19:51,191 --> 01:19:53,160
We would miss it
if you didn't blame us.

1006
01:19:53,193 --> 01:19:54,304
We're masochists
is what you're saying.

1007
01:19:54,328 --> 01:19:55,963
Yeah, we enjoy it.
It makes us feel

1008
01:19:55,996 --> 01:19:57,565
more important
than we actually are.

1009
01:19:57,599 --> 01:20:00,067
Blame us less and we'd be
a lot more humble.

1010
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:00,934
We wouldn't think that

1011
01:20:00,968 --> 01:20:03,137
we were actually
the centre of the world.

1012
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:04,872
I don't believe you.

1013
01:20:04,905 --> 01:20:07,207
You always think
you're the centre of the world.

1014
01:20:07,241 --> 01:20:09,009
You fucking Americans!

1015
01:20:11,011 --> 01:20:12,179
What do you think, Hamid?

1016
01:20:13,314 --> 01:20:17,384
The tongue has no bones, Sir,
but it crushes all the same.

1017
01:21:42,737 --> 01:21:44,104
Is it good?

1018
01:21:45,305 --> 01:21:46,641
It's an apple.

1019
01:21:49,343 --> 01:21:50,678
You speak English.

1020
01:21:55,416 --> 01:21:57,084
Well, I guess the joke's on me.

1021
01:21:58,586 --> 01:22:01,188
There is something
I want to show you.

1022
01:22:20,775 --> 01:22:24,512
The fossil Driss was carrying
when he was hit by your car.

1023
01:22:31,418 --> 01:22:33,454
It was recovered by the police.

1024
01:22:35,088 --> 01:22:38,959
They returned it to me
because it is so valuable.

1025
01:22:40,194 --> 01:22:45,733
It is called an Elvis.
An Elvis?

1026
01:22:45,767 --> 01:22:50,003
Only three specimens
have been found in the Sahara...

1027
01:22:51,038 --> 01:22:54,609
and the dealers decided
to give it the name of Elvis...

1028
01:22:55,209 --> 01:22:57,745
because it is a superstar.

1029
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:01,982
Driss stole it from me.

1030
01:23:04,051 --> 01:23:06,453
This happens all the time.

1031
01:23:08,322 --> 01:23:12,259
The young boys are frustrated.

1032
01:23:13,728 --> 01:23:16,664
They feel they're going nowhere.

1033
01:23:17,732 --> 01:23:20,067
And have no hopes.

1034
01:23:21,769 --> 01:23:24,506
They don't want to be diggers
all their lives.

1035
01:23:25,773 --> 01:23:28,543
They don't want to live
like their fathers.

1036
01:23:29,711 --> 01:23:31,546
They want to escape.

1037
01:23:33,681 --> 01:23:35,517
So, they steal an Elvis...

1038
01:23:36,350 --> 01:23:39,319
which they know will sell
for $10,000

1039
01:23:39,353 --> 01:23:41,021
in the United States.

1040
01:23:42,757 --> 01:23:44,726
If they can sell it
to a foreigner

1041
01:23:44,759 --> 01:23:46,594
for 1,000 Euros...

1042
01:23:48,195 --> 01:23:52,634
they can go to Casablanca,
start a new life...

1043
01:23:58,806 --> 01:24:02,175
Casablanca is full
of loose women.

1044
01:24:03,811 --> 01:24:08,348
And 1,000 Euros
will get you a long way

1045
01:24:09,249 --> 01:24:10,484
with a loose woman.

1046
01:24:15,823 --> 01:24:18,325
I didn't mind when I found out

1047
01:24:18,358 --> 01:24:20,460
that Driss had stolen it
from me.

1048
01:24:21,896 --> 01:24:23,497
I understood him.

1049
01:24:25,399 --> 01:24:28,570
And in a way,
I wished them luck.

1050
01:24:30,672 --> 01:24:32,740
It's only a fossil after all.

1051
01:24:34,274 --> 01:24:37,311
A lump of rock. Literally.

1052
01:24:40,648 --> 01:24:44,752
If he had sold it to you
for a few hundred Euros...

1053
01:24:50,925 --> 01:24:53,427
I would have been happy for him.

1054
01:24:56,864 --> 01:24:58,398
Really happy.

1055
01:25:00,868 --> 01:25:03,236
How much better
it would have been...

1056
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:05,640
if you had stopped
and bought the damn thing.

1057
01:25:06,874 --> 01:25:08,610
You would now be in Azna...

1058
01:25:08,643 --> 01:25:10,745
drinking cocktails
with your wife.

1059
01:25:12,013 --> 01:25:15,717
And Driss would be in Casablanca
in the arms of a loose woman.

1060
01:25:20,354 --> 01:25:22,724
I'm sorry about what happened.

1061
01:25:27,762 --> 01:25:29,463
I'm very sorry.

1062
01:25:32,967 --> 01:25:35,369
But it was a terrible accident.

1063
01:26:00,595 --> 01:26:03,931
I have no idea why you people
have such a thirst

1064
01:26:03,965 --> 01:26:06,333
for these stupid rocks.

1065
01:26:08,002 --> 01:26:09,937
What do you see in them?

1066
01:26:13,941 --> 01:26:16,243
All we know is that
you want them

1067
01:26:16,276 --> 01:26:18,780
and are prepared
to pay money for them.

1068
01:26:22,482 --> 01:26:24,451
Some of us believe...

1069
01:26:25,285 --> 01:26:28,690
that these are the most
evil creatures

1070
01:26:28,723 --> 01:26:30,525
that ever existed...

1071
01:26:32,426 --> 01:26:36,296
that they are the forms
of dead demons.

1072
01:26:38,833 --> 01:26:41,803
That is what they look like,
you must admit.

1073
01:26:44,539 --> 01:26:48,609
They must have an influence
on our minds.

1074
01:26:51,378 --> 01:26:53,548
An influence that is evil.

1075
01:26:56,884 --> 01:26:59,453
And that's what attracts you
to them.

1076
01:27:09,296 --> 01:27:10,732
It's all a mystery.

1077
01:27:13,601 --> 01:27:17,304
Driss took my Elvis and ran...

1078
01:27:18,973 --> 01:27:21,341
and the next person he saw

1079
01:27:22,643 --> 01:27:23,978
was you.

1080
01:28:10,825 --> 01:28:13,628
Hey, get this cunt
the fuck off me, will ya?

1081
01:28:52,399 --> 01:28:54,077
This is how you open
a bottle of champagne.

1082
01:28:54,101 --> 01:28:57,572
You hold it firmly
by the base...

1083
01:28:57,605 --> 01:28:59,907
you turn the bottle,
not the cork.

1084
01:28:59,941 --> 01:29:01,441
Red wine should be held
by the neck,

1085
01:29:01,474 --> 01:29:02,643
a woman by the waist

1086
01:29:02,677 --> 01:29:05,146
and a bottle of champagne
by the derriere.

1087
01:29:05,179 --> 01:29:07,014
Mark Twain, very good.

1088
01:29:07,048 --> 01:29:09,750
Of course, those priorities
can be rearranged later.

1089
01:29:09,784 --> 01:29:10,985
Glad to hear it.

1090
01:29:14,121 --> 01:29:15,590
I feel like
I've been a little phony

1091
01:29:15,623 --> 01:29:16,623
with you in some way.

1092
01:29:17,959 --> 01:29:19,760
Playing a part.
It's not me at all.

1093
01:29:19,794 --> 01:29:21,028
This isn't me either.

1094
01:29:22,763 --> 01:29:24,065
You know...

1095
01:29:24,098 --> 01:29:26,067
I didn't want to meet
a married woman...

1096
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:28,536
just 'cause I thought
she'd be quick and...

1097
01:29:28,569 --> 01:29:30,437
We have our uses, don't we?

1098
01:31:50,177 --> 01:31:53,614
Hello? Hello?

1099
01:32:17,171 --> 01:32:18,171
Good morning.

1100
01:32:31,986 --> 01:32:34,288
I'm sorry, I don't speak Arabic.

1101
01:32:34,321 --> 01:32:36,123
Or Tamazight, I suppose,
is the dialect.

1102
01:33:13,894 --> 01:33:15,729
I see you come out for a walk.

1103
01:33:17,164 --> 01:33:21,235
Of course, you saw there's
nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.

1104
01:33:21,268 --> 01:33:24,672
I wasn't trying to run or hide.
My things are all back...

1105
01:33:55,469 --> 01:33:57,338
Anouar will take you back
to Azna.

1106
01:34:56,263 --> 01:34:57,298
There you are.

1107
01:35:24,158 --> 01:35:25,926
Bit early in the day.

1108
01:35:26,860 --> 01:35:28,996
I haven't been to bed yet.

1109
01:35:29,029 --> 01:35:30,331
It's the gear for you.

1110
01:35:31,432 --> 01:35:35,102
- Been for a swim?
- I feel rejuvenated.

1111
01:35:35,135 --> 01:35:36,971
So awake I'm dangerous.

1112
01:35:37,004 --> 01:35:38,906
Run with it.
It won't last forever.

1113
01:35:40,841 --> 01:35:44,111
- What else have I missed?
- I got waylaid by a Greek god.

1114
01:35:46,447 --> 01:35:49,083
And what does that mean exactly?

1115
01:35:49,116 --> 01:35:50,851
It means,

1116
01:35:50,884 --> 01:35:54,288
I've committed adultery
with a ridiculous man...

1117
01:35:54,321 --> 01:35:55,389
as women always do.

1118
01:35:55,422 --> 01:35:57,992
Yeah, well, such things
have been known to happen.

1119
01:35:58,025 --> 01:35:59,493
Not to me.

1120
01:35:59,527 --> 01:36:02,229
I'm glad.
Don't mean about Tom.

1121
01:36:03,464 --> 01:36:05,799
I mean about you.
Knocked David of his perch.

1122
01:36:05,833 --> 01:36:08,311
- That's a good thing, isn't it?
- I wasn't thinking about David.

1123
01:36:08,335 --> 01:36:10,204
I was just thinking
about myself for once.

1124
01:36:14,074 --> 01:36:18,178
- Are you going to divorce him?
- I think I have to.

1125
01:36:20,247 --> 01:36:21,382
Might be for the best.

1126
01:36:22,916 --> 01:36:26,253
You didn't seem very happy.
Didn't seem like you.

1127
01:36:28,623 --> 01:36:31,025
Guess we were an obvious couple.

1128
01:36:31,058 --> 01:36:33,427
All couples are rather
obvious in the end.

1129
01:36:33,762 --> 01:36:37,097
- Twelve years after all.
- Twelve years.

1130
01:36:38,132 --> 01:36:40,434
I guess it doesn't seem
that long when you say it fast.

1131
01:36:45,507 --> 01:36:49,209
I was thinking none of this
would have happened...

1132
01:36:49,243 --> 01:36:51,078
if we hadn't killed that boy.

1133
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:55,583
- It would have just carried on.
- Driss?

1134
01:36:57,251 --> 01:36:58,852
Boy's name was Driss.

1135
01:37:03,157 --> 01:37:04,325
But you knew that already.

1136
01:37:08,262 --> 01:37:09,564
Driss Taheri.

1137
01:37:11,633 --> 01:37:13,334
What did you do with his ID,
bury it?

1138
01:37:17,304 --> 01:37:19,349
David, what the fuck?
What the fuck are you doing?

1139
01:37:19,373 --> 01:37:20,608
What the fuck are you doing?

1140
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:23,977
That's all in the past.

1141
01:37:28,349 --> 01:37:30,250
The important thing is now,
isn't it?

1142
01:38:46,126 --> 01:38:47,995
What cereal do you eat
in the morning?

1143
01:38:48,028 --> 01:38:50,632
I don't eat breakfast.
I'm usually too hungover.

1144
01:38:51,766 --> 01:38:54,101
I prefer cornflakes myself.

1145
01:38:54,134 --> 01:38:56,470
It is one good thing
that you have given us,

1146
01:38:56,503 --> 01:38:58,238
apart from ice.

1147
01:38:58,673 --> 01:39:00,240
I'm glad you like ice.

1148
01:39:01,108 --> 01:39:04,311
I like everything that is cool,
cold and fresh.

1149
01:39:05,713 --> 01:39:07,347
You think I like to live
in this furnace?

1150
01:39:09,216 --> 01:39:11,586
You think I like the camels,
the palm trees...

1151
01:39:11,619 --> 01:39:14,656
and the 104 degrees
every morning? Huh?

1152
01:39:15,557 --> 01:39:17,491
No, not at all.

1153
01:39:19,326 --> 01:39:20,762
I dream of Sweden
most of the time.

1154
01:39:20,795 --> 01:39:21,795
Sweden?

1155
01:39:23,363 --> 01:39:25,999
Yeah. I've seen it
in a colour magazine.

1156
01:39:27,234 --> 01:39:29,203
A fantastic place,
by the looks of it.

1157
01:39:31,305 --> 01:39:33,106
It is the place
I would most like to live.

1158
01:39:34,709 --> 01:39:36,376
Must be so deliciously
cold there.

1159
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:42,120
But the world does not promise
anything to anyone...

1160
01:39:43,450 --> 01:39:45,587
and no man ever lived
the way he wished.

1161
01:40:50,417 --> 01:40:53,821
- Goats in a tree.
- It's a fraud, David.

1162
01:40:53,855 --> 01:40:55,790
They don't climb up there
on their own.

1163
01:40:55,823 --> 01:40:57,333
The old man in the shop
will come out...

1164
01:40:57,357 --> 01:40:59,326
and ask you if you'd like
your picture taken.

1165
01:40:59,359 --> 01:41:01,629
For a very small fee, of course.

1166
01:41:01,663 --> 01:41:03,565
Crooks, David.
Tricksters.

1167
01:41:05,833 --> 01:41:08,268
- Breakfast!
- Where'd you get that?

1168
01:41:15,242 --> 01:41:17,545
- It's good, huh?
- It's good.

1169
01:41:46,306 --> 01:41:48,442
Do you think
Abdellah has forgiven me?

1170
01:41:50,778 --> 01:41:52,412
He could tell
that you were sorry.

1171
01:41:54,849 --> 01:41:56,183
He judged you to be sincere.

1172
01:42:03,490 --> 01:42:07,361
- But does he forgive me?
- I'm sure of it.

1173
01:42:08,696 --> 01:42:10,698
He must have forgiven you.

1174
01:42:10,732 --> 01:42:13,568
Otherwise you and I would not
be drinking tea here in Alnif.

1175
01:42:17,304 --> 01:42:18,338
Anouar...

1176
01:42:19,707 --> 01:42:21,141
It was my fault.

1177
01:42:22,577 --> 01:42:23,577
The accident.

1178
01:42:24,846 --> 01:42:26,914
It was 100% my fault.

1179
01:42:30,350 --> 01:42:31,753
I had been drinking all day.

1180
01:42:33,888 --> 01:42:35,455
I was driving too fast.

1181
01:42:37,659 --> 01:42:39,326
I was arguing with my wife.

1182
01:42:41,763 --> 01:42:43,430
Driss did nothing wrong...

1183
01:42:43,463 --> 01:42:46,634
except step into the road
to try to make us slow down.

1184
01:42:55,009 --> 01:42:56,611
It was my fault.

1185
01:43:04,819 --> 01:43:05,819
Anouar...

1186
01:43:08,890 --> 01:43:10,257
It was my fault.

1187
01:43:51,566 --> 01:43:53,400
Time to say goodbye, my friend.

1188
01:43:54,969 --> 01:43:56,537
Goodbye.

1189
01:44:25,332 --> 01:44:26,332
Why?

1190
01:44:27,802 --> 01:44:28,870
No reason.

1191
01:44:30,437 --> 01:44:31,438
Well, for Sweden.

1192
01:44:36,878 --> 01:44:38,746
You're a decent man, Anouar.

1193
01:44:40,581 --> 01:44:42,784
And you, David.
You are an honourable one.

1194
01:45:16,684 --> 01:45:19,086
- Richard sent you?
- No, I saw the jeep.

1195
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:21,923
So much for the
welcoming committee.

1196
01:45:24,391 --> 01:45:25,391
Mrs. Henninger.

1197
01:45:26,627 --> 01:45:28,395
I believe
she's in her room, sir.

1198
01:45:28,428 --> 01:45:29,597
David.

1199
01:45:30,598 --> 01:45:31,732
I never did ask your name.

1200
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:35,402
- Hamid.
- Cheers, Hamid.

1201
01:46:00,427 --> 01:46:02,897
I knew Henninger a while back.

1202
01:46:02,930 --> 01:46:04,632
Never liked him much.

1203
01:46:04,665 --> 01:46:05,900
We went to the same school.

1204
01:46:06,767 --> 01:46:10,605
He was one of the old boys,
somewhat notorious.

1205
01:46:10,638 --> 01:46:11,973
Really?

1206
01:46:12,006 --> 01:46:14,675
Did he lark about?
Unnatural practices?

1207
01:46:14,709 --> 01:46:17,645
No, nothing of that sort.

1208
01:46:17,678 --> 01:46:19,580
More of an agitator apparently.

1209
01:46:20,915 --> 01:46:22,783
I was told he once put out
a newspaper called

1210
01:46:22,817 --> 01:46:24,852
England without Darkies.

1211
01:46:26,486 --> 01:46:29,190
The spoofs about people
feeling ashamed of their

1212
01:46:29,223 --> 01:46:30,791
thinly veiled racism.

1213
01:46:30,825 --> 01:46:33,661
He should consider republishing.

1214
01:46:33,694 --> 01:46:35,428
No thin veils anymore.

1215
01:46:35,462 --> 01:46:37,765
- So he was a lefty then?
- I suppose so.

1216
01:46:41,802 --> 01:46:44,504
Do you think they buried
the Arab boy, all right?

1217
01:46:44,538 --> 01:46:45,538
Assume so.

1218
01:46:46,741 --> 01:46:47,885
It's the way they do
things here.

1219
01:46:47,909 --> 01:46:49,844
Brush them under the carpet.

1220
01:46:49,877 --> 01:46:51,679
No one wants any trouble
in the end.

1221
01:46:52,813 --> 01:46:54,115
I expect poor David...

1222
01:46:54,148 --> 01:46:55,616
had to bribe them up
to the hilt.

1223
01:46:55,650 --> 01:46:57,818
Silly bugger.
Cars do have brakes, you know?

1224
01:46:59,253 --> 01:47:00,821
It's been my attitude all along.

1225
01:47:12,733 --> 01:47:14,101
What?

1226
01:47:20,141 --> 01:47:22,109
- What is this?
- A souvenir.

1227
01:47:34,755 --> 01:47:35,755
What happened out there?

1228
01:47:38,092 --> 01:47:39,927
The father wanted to talk to me,
that's all.

1229
01:47:42,029 --> 01:47:43,664
- Did he ask for money?
- No.

1230
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:47,902
I gave it to them anyway.

1231
01:47:50,938 --> 01:47:52,139
You find that hard to believe.

1232
01:47:54,675 --> 01:47:57,477
I don't know.
Yeah, I'm a little surprised.

1233
01:48:01,082 --> 01:48:02,482
Anyway.

1234
01:48:07,288 --> 01:48:09,023
It's over.

1235
01:48:12,727 --> 01:48:13,728
Bags in cars.

1236
01:48:15,730 --> 01:48:17,198
Over here.

1237
01:48:17,231 --> 01:48:20,067
Okay, that's it.
Cheese! Okay.

1238
01:48:20,768 --> 01:48:21,769
Is that it?

1239
01:48:21,802 --> 01:48:22,303
- That's it.
- Yeah.

1240
01:48:22,336 --> 01:48:23,604
Ciao, bambina.

1241
01:48:27,041 --> 01:48:28,609
Thank you, boys. Ciao.

1242
01:48:33,714 --> 01:48:35,249
Flowers, please, Dally.

1243
01:48:35,282 --> 01:48:37,785
Shame we
didn't get any alone time.

1244
01:48:37,818 --> 01:48:39,720
Maybe just as well.

1245
01:48:39,754 --> 01:48:41,689
Give my best to Jo for me,
will you?

1246
01:48:41,722 --> 01:48:44,082
- You know how I hate goodbyes.
- Oh yeah, Tom. I know that.

1247
01:48:45,826 --> 01:48:48,796
- What are you doing?
- I need a ride to Casablanca.

1248
01:48:48,829 --> 01:48:49,830
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1249
01:48:49,864 --> 01:48:51,665
What have you done
for me lately?

1250
01:48:51,699 --> 01:48:54,568
Mate, I can suck a golf ball
through a fucking garden hose.

1251
01:48:54,602 --> 01:48:57,038
Yeah, that's what they all say.
Get in.

1252
01:49:01,075 --> 01:49:03,878
- See you at Azrou for dinner.
- We'll order the trout.

1253
01:49:05,746 --> 01:49:07,224
Maribel,
get your pretty little bottom moving.

1254
01:49:07,248 --> 01:49:08,783
People are waiting.

1255
01:49:10,084 --> 01:49:12,653
- And where are you two off to?
- Tinghir.

1256
01:49:12,686 --> 01:49:15,256
The hotel de Sud
or whatever it's called.

1257
01:49:15,289 --> 01:49:17,725
Maribel wants to experience
the desert,

1258
01:49:17,758 --> 01:49:20,327
whatever the fuck that means.
It was a great party, Dicky.

1259
01:49:20,361 --> 01:49:22,296
Delighted you could make it,
your lordship.

1260
01:49:22,329 --> 01:49:24,632
I'd never throw
these kinds of parties myself...

1261
01:49:24,665 --> 01:49:26,667
unless orgies could be arranged.

1262
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:29,770
Alas, the age of orgies
appears to have ended.

1263
01:49:29,804 --> 01:49:32,106
Arrivederci.

1264
01:49:32,139 --> 01:49:33,150
- Ciao.
- Ciao, ciao, bambino.

1265
01:49:33,174 --> 01:49:35,242
Good to see ya!

1266
01:49:53,194 --> 01:49:54,795
You were having a nightmare.

1267
01:49:58,265 --> 01:49:59,265
Yes.

1268
01:50:02,970 --> 01:50:04,605
So, why didn't you wake me?

1269
01:50:05,439 --> 01:50:06,340
Oh, I thought...

1270
01:50:06,373 --> 01:50:08,309
you're not supposed
to wake people up...

1271
01:50:09,443 --> 01:50:11,679
That's sleepwalking, isn't it?

1272
01:50:13,047 --> 01:50:14,047
Sorry.

1273
01:50:16,083 --> 01:50:17,952
I was dreaming I was inside...

1274
01:50:19,753 --> 01:50:21,689
a giant Boeing turbine.

1275
01:50:23,390 --> 01:50:26,127
And I was supposed
to clean the blades.

1276
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:28,129
All I had was a toothbrush.

1277
01:50:29,296 --> 01:50:31,832
Suddenly, the turbines
began to spin...

1278
01:50:33,167 --> 01:50:35,136
and I was shredded.

1279
01:50:36,871 --> 01:50:38,639
How do you know
it was a Boeing turbine?

1280
01:50:40,941 --> 01:50:42,009
Good question.

1281
01:50:44,411 --> 01:50:45,880
You inspired?

1282
01:50:48,149 --> 01:50:49,850
Yeah, I have an idea
for a new book.

1283
01:50:52,753 --> 01:50:53,988
Congratulations.

1284
01:50:58,726 --> 01:51:00,770
You know, we're more than happy
for you to stay an extra night.

1285
01:51:00,794 --> 01:51:03,797
Makes more sense for you
to start out early tomorrow.

1286
01:51:03,831 --> 01:51:06,300
No, I slept all afternoon.
We'll drive through the night...

1287
01:51:06,333 --> 01:51:09,003
and get back to Tangier
in a single leap I think.

1288
01:51:09,036 --> 01:51:09,870
I know what you're thinking,

1289
01:51:09,904 --> 01:51:12,039
but lightning
doesn't strike twice.

1290
01:51:12,072 --> 01:51:14,175
Yeah, it does.

1291
01:51:14,208 --> 01:51:16,877
Well, we fixed the car
as best we could.

1292
01:51:16,911 --> 01:51:18,288
There's a picnic hamper
in the back seat.

1293
01:51:18,312 --> 01:51:20,080
The booze is nonalcoholic.

1294
01:51:23,284 --> 01:51:24,284
Anyway...

1295
01:51:27,254 --> 01:51:28,923
It's all ended
peacefully enough.

1296
01:51:30,257 --> 01:51:31,959
Not for the boy, I know, but...

1297
01:51:32,893 --> 01:51:35,829
for everyone else
it could have been a lot worse.

1298
01:51:35,863 --> 01:51:37,865
They have any interest
in carpets

1299
01:51:37,898 --> 01:51:39,266
out there out in the desert?

1300
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:41,202
I've never seen anything
from that far out.

1301
01:51:41,235 --> 01:51:43,270
I didn't notice the carpets.

1302
01:51:43,304 --> 01:51:45,272
Did you see Tom
before he got off?

1303
01:51:45,306 --> 01:51:46,106
No.

1304
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:47,875
He got off without us
seeing him.

1305
01:51:47,908 --> 01:51:49,143
How'd he do that, Dicky?

1306
01:51:50,311 --> 01:51:53,847
Don't know.
He's a slippery chap.

1307
01:51:55,416 --> 01:51:57,785
See him once a year and I
never know who he is really.

1308
01:51:57,818 --> 01:52:00,287
- Who's Tom?
- The American.

1309
01:52:02,356 --> 01:52:03,857
The American?

1310
01:52:10,898 --> 01:52:13,100
Oh, of course.

1311
01:52:16,503 --> 01:52:18,472
Give us a call
when you get back.

1312
01:52:18,505 --> 01:52:21,242
We always worry until we know
people are home safe.

1313
01:52:21,275 --> 01:52:24,078
And treat yourself
to something nice in Tangier.

1314
01:52:24,111 --> 01:52:26,413
It does wonders, you know,
a little retail therapy.

1315
01:52:26,447 --> 01:52:27,881
Will do that. Bye.

1316
01:52:28,849 --> 01:52:29,917
Bye.

1317
01:52:35,022 --> 01:52:37,124
- Safe journey, David.
- Goodbye, Hamid.

1318
01:52:48,469 --> 01:52:52,106
- What a ghastly weekend.
- That French bitch.

1319
01:52:52,139 --> 01:52:54,576
Amazing people like that
actually exist, isn't it?

1320
01:52:54,609 --> 01:52:57,278
Who was she with? Remind me.

1321
01:52:57,311 --> 01:53:00,147
<i>The New York Times,</i>
Style section.

1322
01:53:00,180 --> 01:53:01,181
Thank God for that.

1323
01:53:01,215 --> 01:53:03,083
I thought you were going
to say <i>The Guardian.</i>

1324
01:53:03,117 --> 01:53:04,519
I told Hamid
to lock the place up,

1325
01:53:04,552 --> 01:53:06,253
outer gates and everything.

1326
01:53:07,254 --> 01:53:10,824
- Why'd you do that?
- Just to be on the safe side.

1327
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:29,443
- We need to talk.
- No we don't.

1328
01:53:32,346 --> 01:53:35,082
- Excuse me?
- We don't need to talk.

1329
01:53:35,115 --> 01:53:36,450
Nobody needs to talk.

1330
01:53:37,519 --> 01:53:39,587
We can choose to talk
or not talk.

1331
01:53:39,621 --> 01:53:41,989
Which I can assume
you're choosing not to talk.

1332
01:53:42,022 --> 01:53:43,357
Your assumption is correct.

1333
01:53:47,961 --> 01:53:49,721
You don't even want
to talk about your shirt?

1334
01:53:58,138 --> 01:54:01,408
- God, I hate Lou Reed.
- It's Velvet Underground.

1335
01:54:01,442 --> 01:54:03,010
How can you hate Lou Reed?

1336
01:54:07,348 --> 01:54:10,317
- I think we should stop.
- What? Why?

1337
01:54:10,351 --> 01:54:13,220
It's where we hit him, Driss.

1338
01:54:13,253 --> 01:54:15,489
I think we should stop
and pay our respects.

1339
01:54:19,460 --> 01:54:20,700
There's someone in the road.

1340
01:54:32,707 --> 01:54:34,208
No, don't get out of the car.

1341
01:54:43,484 --> 01:54:44,619
David?

1342
01:54:57,464 --> 01:54:58,566
David.

1343
01:55:09,711 --> 01:55:11,011
Abdellah sent you.

1344
01:55:17,084 --> 01:55:18,118
David!

1345
01:55:20,020 --> 01:55:22,098
- It's all right. It's all right.
- It's not... It's not all right.

1346
01:55:22,122 --> 01:55:23,257
It's a fucking carjacking.

1347
01:55:26,628 --> 01:55:28,095
It's not a carjacking.

1348
01:55:33,066 --> 01:55:34,401
- Don't!
- Do it.

1349
01:55:35,335 --> 01:55:37,337
No, David.

1350
01:55:42,242 --> 01:55:44,546
- Do it.
- David!

1351
01:55:47,114 --> 01:55:48,114
Do it!

1351
01:55:49,305 --> 01:56:49,438
