2
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,918
Our last rainy season.

3
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:53,043
Just think, Pastuzo.

4
00:00:53,126 --> 00:00:55,835
This time next month,
we'll be in London.

5
00:00:55,918 --> 00:01:01,793
Where the rivers run with marmalade
and the streets are paved with bread.

6
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:03,835
Did you read the book about London?

7
00:01:03,918 --> 00:01:06,918
- I skimmed it.
- Oh, Pastuzo!

8
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:09,918
Well, reading makes me sleepy.

9
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:12,043
But any city
that can come up with this...

10
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:14,501
...is all right by me.

11
00:01:16,418 --> 00:01:18,751
Ooh. Pastuzo, look!

12
00:01:20,876 --> 00:01:23,168
It's... It's a cub!

13
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:24,918
Lucy!

14
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,960
Lower me down.

15
00:01:27,085 --> 00:01:28,918
Be careful.

16
00:01:40,876 --> 00:01:43,210
Lower, Pastuzo. Lower!

17
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,543
Lucy.

18
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:03,085
Lucy!

19
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:07,085
I'm afraid we're not going to London
after all.

20
00:02:07,626 --> 00:02:09,043
Why not?

21
00:02:09,126 --> 00:02:11,210
We've got a cub to raise.

22
00:02:12,418 --> 00:02:13,751
What's he like?

23
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:16,210
Rather small.

24
00:02:16,335 --> 00:02:17,918
And rather sneezy.

25
00:02:19,543 --> 00:02:21,918
But he likes his marmalade.

26
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:24,293
That's a good sign.

27
00:02:24,418 --> 00:02:26,293
Oh, yes, Pastuzo.

28
00:02:26,418 --> 00:02:31,710
If we look after this bear,
I have a feeling he'll go far.

29
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:52,960
<i>Dear Aunt Lucy,</i>

30
00:02:53,043 --> 00:02:55,543
<i>I hope all is well
in the Home for Retired Bears.</i>

31
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:58,585
<i>Life in London has been
better than ever this summer.</i>

32
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:02,335
<i>I've really got to grips
with how things work.</i>

33
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:08,126
Aaah!

34
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,543
<i>And it seems there's something new
to do every day.</i>

35
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:11,626
Hm.

36
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,376
Guess what, Paddington.
The steam fair's coming to town.

37
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,835
I'm going along tonight
to write about it in my newspaper.

38
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:18,585
Who's going to want to read about that?

39
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:21,501
Everyone. They travel the world
in an old steam train.

40
00:03:21,585 --> 00:03:22,710
I thought you'd love it.

41
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:25,876
I do. Don't tell anyone, OK? Not cool.

42
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,626
- Why don't we all go?
- Good idea.

43
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,751
Your father's a dab hand
at the coconut shy.

44
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,210
- Bullseye Brown they used to call him.
- Not any more.

45
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:33,918
Coconuts are a young man's game.

46
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:37,168
Well, I think you're in great shape
for a man your age, Mr Brown.

47
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:40,251
Ah, thank you, Paddington.
Hang on, how old do you think I am?

48
00:03:40,376 --> 00:03:42,460
Oh, er, about 80.

49
00:03:43,251 --> 00:03:45,251
- Eighty?
- At least.

50
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:47,960
- Just a minute, young bear.
- Hm?

51
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:50,626
Thought I told you
to wash behind your ears.

52
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,918
Oh, but I did, Mrs Bird. I...

53
00:03:53,001 --> 00:03:55,126
I wonder how that got in there.

54
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:57,335
<i>I really feel at home
in Windsor Gardens.</i>

55
00:03:57,418 --> 00:04:00,793
<i>- Bonjour, mademoiselle!</i>
- Good morning, Paddington.

56
00:04:00,876 --> 00:04:03,210
- I brought you breakfast.
- Thank you.

57
00:04:03,335 --> 00:04:05,501
Your sandwiches
always put me in a good mood.

58
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:08,543
Morning, Dr Jafri.
Haven't forgotten your keys, have you?

59
00:04:08,626 --> 00:04:12,085
Keys? Keys! Oh, oh!

60
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,543
- Well caught.
- Thank you, Paddington.

61
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:16,960
You're welcome. Glorious day, Colonel.

62
00:04:17,043 --> 00:04:20,043
Is it? How absolutely thrilling.

63
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,626
How was your date, Miss Kitts?

64
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:24,001
Well, he wasn't the one,
but you know what they say.

65
00:04:24,085 --> 00:04:26,626
- Plenty more fish in the sea.
- Exactly.

66
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,710
Thank you!

67
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:33,668
- Morning, Paddington.
- Morning, Mr Barnes.

68
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:36,001
- Bye, Paddington.
<i>- Au revoir, mademoiselle.</i>

69
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:37,793
Right, test me.

70
00:04:37,876 --> 00:04:40,460
What's the quickest way
from Baker Street to Big Ben?

71
00:04:40,543 --> 00:04:41,543
Ah, an easy one.

72
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:44,126
Turn right onto Portman Square. Left...

73
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,335
<i>Everyone has been so kind
and welcoming,</i>

74
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:48,043
<i>even though they're very busy.</i>

75
00:04:49,418 --> 00:04:51,626
<i>Mrs Brown is planning to swim to France.</i>

76
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:54,293
<i>It seems an awful lot of hard work</i>

77
00:04:54,376 --> 00:04:58,751
<i>when you can go by boat or plane
or even train. But that's not the point.</i>

78
00:04:58,876 --> 00:05:00,543
<i>She's been cooped up all summer</i>

79
00:05:00,626 --> 00:05:03,460
<i>illustrating a series
of adventure stories</i>

80
00:05:03,543 --> 00:05:05,876
<i>and has decided
she wants one of her own.</i>

81
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:07,793
Whoo-hoo!

82
00:05:09,335 --> 00:05:11,793
<i>Judy has been suffering
from a broken heart.</i>

83
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:15,335
I'm dumped? I think you'll find
you're dumped, Tony.

84
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,751
<i>Her first reaction was to become a nun.</i>

85
00:05:17,835 --> 00:05:22,251
<i>But she soon got over that
and has thrown herself into a new hobby.</i>

86
00:05:22,335 --> 00:05:26,376
<i>She found an old printing press
at school and is starting a newspaper,</i>

87
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,501
<i>with no boys.</i>

88
00:05:27,585 --> 00:05:29,710
Now all we need is some news.

89
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,376
<i>Jonathan is joining her
at big school this year.</i>

90
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:34,126
<i>He spent the holidays</i>

91
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,501
<i>- building a fully working steam engine.</i>
- Whoo!

92
00:05:36,585 --> 00:05:39,543
<i>But I'm not supposed to talk about that
as it's "not cool".</i>

93
00:05:39,626 --> 00:05:42,043
<i>He's got a whole new look</i>

94
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:45,376
<i>and if anyone asks,
he's now called J-Dog</i>

95
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:48,585
<i>and he's definitely not
into steam trains.</i>

96
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:52,126
- Those times...
<i>- But Mr Brown has been busiest of all.</i>

97
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,251
<i>He recently had a surprise at work.</i>

98
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:59,251
I am delighted to announce
our new head of risk analysis will be...

99
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:02,668
Mr Steve Visby.

100
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:08,835
<i>And this has prompted what Mrs Bird
calls "a full-blown midlife crisis".</i>

101
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:11,793
<i>It involves blending his food,</i>

102
00:06:11,876 --> 00:06:13,960
<i>painting his hair,</i>

103
00:06:14,085 --> 00:06:16,918
<i>and engaging in a process
called chakrabatics.</i>

104
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,126
Open your mind
and your legs will follow.

105
00:06:21,793 --> 00:06:24,501
- Thank you, Paddington.
- Keep up the good work.

106
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,585
<i>Oh, Aunt Lucy,
you sent me to London to find a home,</i>

107
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:31,293
<i>and it's worked out better
than I ever imagined.</i>

108
00:06:31,376 --> 00:06:32,793
<i>I have a wonderful family.</i>

109
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:36,126
<i>And have made friends
in all sorts of places.</i>

110
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:37,251
Here, boy.

111
00:06:38,085 --> 00:06:40,918
There you go, Wolfie.

112
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:44,501
<i>I do hope if you could see me,
you'd be pleased.</i>

113
00:06:44,585 --> 00:06:47,960
<i>Lots of love, from Paddington.</i>

114
00:06:48,043 --> 00:06:50,751
- Mr Gruber?
- Ah, Mr Brown, come in.

115
00:06:50,835 --> 00:06:55,085
I just had a visit from Madame Kozlova
who runs the fair.

116
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,460
- Oh, yes?
- They were having a clear-out

117
00:06:57,585 --> 00:07:01,918
and found all these old crates
stuffed full with "memory-bilia"

118
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:04,043
they thought had been lost forever.

119
00:07:04,168 --> 00:07:07,085
She asked me if I would sell it
for them while they're in town.

120
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,168
And it struck me
there might be something in here

121
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:11,918
for your auntie's birthday.

122
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:13,418
Oh, good idea.

123
00:07:14,793 --> 00:07:16,751
Ah, look at this!

124
00:07:19,043 --> 00:07:23,543
- It's very nice, Mr Gruber, but...
- I know, I know, it has to be perfect.

125
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:27,210
Well, since Uncle Pastuzo died,
I'm the only relative she's got left.

126
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:29,418
And it isn't every day
a bear turns a hundred.

127
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:31,293
Quite so. Ah!

128
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,751
How about these rolling shoes?

129
00:07:34,835 --> 00:07:36,710
Please, Mr Gruber, be serious.

130
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:39,835
Perhaps your auntie's rolling days
are behind her.

131
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,001
I think you might be right.

132
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:45,335
- Oh, what's this?
- Ah!

133
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:48,668
That must be the popping book.
Very interesting.

134
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:49,751
Really?

135
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:52,751
You see,
Madame Kozlova's great-grandmother,

136
00:07:52,835 --> 00:07:56,418
who started the fair,
was also a brilliant artist.

137
00:07:56,501 --> 00:08:00,210
And every time they visited a new city,
she made a popping book

138
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:02,501
- to remember it by.
- Ohh.

139
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:04,751
And this is London.

140
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:14,168
Oh, Mr Gruber, it's wonderful.

141
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:17,668
Aunt Lucy always dreamed
of coming to London and...

142
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:20,918
never had the chance.
But if she saw this...

143
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,543
it would be like she were finally here.

144
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,668
Oh!

145
00:08:31,751 --> 00:08:34,335
Aunt Lucy! Aunt Lucy!

146
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:36,793
Paddington!

147
00:08:36,876 --> 00:08:37,960
Oop.

148
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:47,793
Come with me, Aunt Lucy.

149
00:08:47,876 --> 00:08:52,835
Oh, yes, please.
I want to see everything.

150
00:08:52,918 --> 00:08:54,043
It's just down here.

151
00:08:54,126 --> 00:08:56,251
Get all your racing news
right here.

152
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:59,793
- Well, what do you think?
- It's wonderful.

153
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:02,918
Right here, ladies and gents...

154
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,418
All aboard!

155
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:06,418
One and a half bears, please.

156
00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:10,626
- Mind your step, madam.
- Oh. What a polite young man.

157
00:09:12,543 --> 00:09:15,710
What a polite young pigeon.

158
00:09:15,793 --> 00:09:19,293
It's so echoey. Echoes around.

159
00:09:20,585 --> 00:09:23,376
Sides turning!

160
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:31,960
Oh, Paddington,
you've made an old bear so very happy.

161
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:34,626
This is perfect.

162
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:37,293
- Ahh.
- Ahh?

163
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,918
- We have a snag.
- Do we?

164
00:09:40,001 --> 00:09:43,668
You see, this popping book
is the only one of its kind.

165
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:46,418
and they want
rather a lot of money for it.

166
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:50,168
Oh, well, Mrs Bird found this coin
in my ear at breakfast.

167
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:51,460
Perhaps there's more.

168
00:09:51,543 --> 00:09:54,585
It would take
more than an earful, Mr Brown.

169
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:58,001
I'm afraid you would need
a thousand of those coins.

170
00:09:58,126 --> 00:09:59,460
Oh.

171
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:03,376
Let's take another look at the monkey.
I think he's super-duper.

172
00:10:04,876 --> 00:10:07,501
- Oh!
- I can fix that.

173
00:10:07,626 --> 00:10:10,001
That's very kind, Mr Gruber, but...

174
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:12,751
Aunt Lucy did so much for me
when I was a cub

175
00:10:12,835 --> 00:10:15,710
and this could be my way
of saying thank you.

176
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:19,668
I'm going to get a job
and buy that book.

177
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:22,710
Back in a few minutes,
Paddington. Ciao ciao.

178
00:10:22,793 --> 00:10:24,960
Ciao ciao, Mr Giuseppe.

179
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:30,501
Good afternoon.
Welcome to Giuseppe's grooming salon.

180
00:10:30,585 --> 00:10:33,960
What can I do for you today, sir?
A shave? A light pomade?

181
00:10:34,043 --> 00:10:35,210
Or is it just a brush?

182
00:10:36,793 --> 00:10:38,251
Quick trim, barber.

183
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:40,293
Oh, I'm not the barber. I just tidy up.

184
00:10:40,376 --> 00:10:43,960
Yeah, well, that's all I want. Tidy up
the back and sides. Nothing off the top.

185
00:10:44,085 --> 00:10:47,085
- Yes, but...
- No "buts". Come on, man, chop chop.

186
00:10:47,835 --> 00:10:50,210
If you say so, sir.

187
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:51,793
Oh...

188
00:10:52,876 --> 00:10:55,251
Hmm... Ah!

189
00:10:58,126 --> 00:10:59,126
Hmm...

190
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,251
On. Whoa!

191
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:25,126
G-G-Giuse-e-e-eppe's?

192
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,251
W-W-Would you mi-i-ind
if I call you ba-ack?

193
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:33,126
I think I ma-ay be about to sha-ave
a customer.

194
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:35,751
Oop. Oh, thanks goodness.

195
00:11:39,918 --> 00:11:42,876
Just putting you on hold!

196
00:11:45,043 --> 00:11:48,210
- But I don't want to.
- It's only a haircut, Nelson.

197
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:50,918
There's nothing to be afraid of.

198
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,585
Come in. Take a seat.

199
00:11:53,376 --> 00:11:56,626
We'll go somewhere else.

200
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,876
Ooh, that's not good.

201
00:12:03,918 --> 00:12:06,626
Ooh. Um...

202
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:08,835
Um...

203
00:12:10,418 --> 00:12:12,710
No. Um...

204
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:14,876
Ah!

205
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:20,376
Well...

206
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:24,751
Just giving you some product, sir.

207
00:12:24,835 --> 00:12:28,126
Ah, jolly good. Carry on.

208
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,168
All done.

209
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:33,793
I must say, it's turned out
a lot better than I expected.

210
00:12:39,543 --> 00:12:42,168
What... What the devil's that?

211
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:44,376
It's, er, marmalade.

212
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,293
Marmalade?

213
00:12:46,418 --> 00:12:50,460
- Hairy marmalade.
- Well, get it off!

214
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:52,001
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

215
00:12:52,918 --> 00:12:55,751
Oh, yuck! What is the matter with you?

216
00:12:55,835 --> 00:12:58,418
- Paddington!
- Mr Giuseppe. I can explain...

217
00:12:58,501 --> 00:13:03,626
It's really not as bad as it looks.

218
00:13:04,876 --> 00:13:06,793
Have you ever been fired, Mr Brown?

219
00:13:06,876 --> 00:13:11,585
Well, no, but are you quite sure you're
ready for the workplace, Paddington?

220
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:14,085
It's a tough,
competitive world out there

221
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:17,793
and I worry a good-natured little bear
might get trampled underfoot.

222
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:20,001
He's right, you know.
You can't trust anyone.

223
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:22,085
That's why
I'm doing my newspaper alone.

224
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,168
Darling, is this about Tony?

225
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:26,376
- No!
- Everything's about Tony.

226
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,251
The reason no one's helping
with your paper is because it's so lame.

227
00:13:29,335 --> 00:13:31,626
Well, at least I'm not pretending
to be someone I'm not.

228
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,460
Nor am I. G-Man!

229
00:13:33,543 --> 00:13:35,710
- J-Dog.
- Spud bounce.

230
00:13:35,793 --> 00:13:38,876
But Aunt Lucy said, "If we're kind
and polite, the world will be right."

231
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:41,043
- At least someone's making sense.
- Oh, sorry.

232
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:43,918
And you're kind, Mr Brown,
and you made it to the top.

233
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:46,668
I'm nowhere near the top.
I peaked in the middle.

234
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:50,668
Now my hair's gone grey, my belly's
popped out, and I've started to creak.

235
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:52,251
Oh!

236
00:13:52,335 --> 00:13:54,710
Doesn't that man live in the big house
on the corner?

237
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:57,543
- It's Phoenix Buchanan.
- Dad's celebrity client.

238
00:13:57,626 --> 00:13:59,585
He's one of our Platinum Club members.

239
00:13:59,668 --> 00:14:01,668
And a very famous actor.

240
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:03,626
Or used to be.

241
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,543
- Now he just does dog-food commercials.
- Hm.

242
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:09,335
Mrs Bird doesn't like him
because he can never remember her name.

243
00:14:09,418 --> 00:14:12,001
Now then, simmer down, simmer...
All right, little bit more.

244
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:16,293
That's enough!
I'm sorry, I'm at my worst tonight.

245
00:14:16,376 --> 00:14:18,501
I really am. I am...

246
00:14:18,668 --> 00:14:22,460
tickled the deepest shade of shrimp

247
00:14:22,543 --> 00:14:25,876
to have been asked here tonight
to open this wonderful old steam fair.

248
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,418
But you know, when Madame Kozlova
created this thing all those years ago,

249
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:34,960
she most certainly was not thinking
of people like me, whatever I am.

250
00:14:35,043 --> 00:14:39,085
VIP, celebrity. I hate all that stuff.
No, no...

251
00:14:39,168 --> 00:14:41,585
West End legend, that's another one.

252
00:14:41,668 --> 00:14:46,460
No, no, she was thinking of you guys,
huh? The ordinary people.

253
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:51,043
So, I'm going to ask one of <i>you</i>
to come up here and open the fair.

254
00:14:51,126 --> 00:14:52,710
Volunteers? Anyone.

255
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:53,876
Ooh!

256
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,251
Eeny, meeny, miney...

257
00:14:57,918 --> 00:14:58,918
...bear!

258
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:01,835
Let's have the young bear. Why not?

259
00:15:01,918 --> 00:15:04,876
- Come, come, young ursine.
- Thank you.

260
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,210
Up here, my furry friend.
Very good, very good.

261
00:15:07,293 --> 00:15:10,001
- Now, your name is?
- Paddington Brown.

262
00:15:10,085 --> 00:15:12,793
Oh, well, of course it is.
You are my new neighbour.

263
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:14,501
You live with...

264
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:19,085
Henry and Mary
and the great Mrs...

265
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,710
Now then, I suppose you know who I am.

266
00:15:21,793 --> 00:15:23,918
Oh, yes. You're a very famous actor.

267
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:27,168
- Oh, pooh.
- Or used to be.

268
00:15:27,251 --> 00:15:30,043
Now you do dog-food commercials.

269
00:15:30,126 --> 00:15:33,335
- Well, a man has to eat.
- What, dog food?

270
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:40,168
Oh, very, very funny.

271
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:42,710
Anyway, they do say

272
00:15:42,793 --> 00:15:45,501
that at Madame Kozlova's,
all your dreams come true.

273
00:15:45,585 --> 00:15:47,960
So, if you had one wish tonight,
what would it be?

274
00:15:48,043 --> 00:15:51,585
Oh, that's easy. I'd like to get
my Aunt Lucy a birthday present.

275
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,626
- Aww.
- Darling.

276
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,960
I've got my eye
on an old pop-up book of London.

277
00:15:56,043 --> 00:15:58,293
Made by Madame Kozlova, as it happens.

278
00:15:58,376 --> 00:16:00,460
The only problem is
it's rather expensive.

279
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:03,418
So I need to get my paws
on an awful lot of money.

280
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:05,668
Well, I'm not sure
that we can offer you that.

281
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:07,793
But we can of course offer you

282
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:11,668
o-o-o-odles of fun.
So, if you would like to lend me a paw,

283
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:15,126
we now declare Kozlova's Steam Fair...

284
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,210
...open!

285
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:19,668
Thank you, thank you very much.

286
00:16:20,376 --> 00:16:22,543
Wonderful! Thank you. Ooh!

287
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:25,418
Ooh, wonderful.

288
00:16:25,501 --> 00:16:26,668
Mrs Brown?

289
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:28,626
Just one moment.
A word in your ear.

290
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,626
- Hm?
- This, er, this pop-up book.

291
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,668
- Do you know it?
- I know of it.

292
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:37,335
But I was led to believe it was lost.
Where on earth did you find it?

293
00:16:37,418 --> 00:16:39,210
Oh, at Mr Gruber's antique shop.

294
00:16:39,293 --> 00:16:43,043
He's keeping it to one side for me
but I really need a job.

295
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:46,418
I don't suppose you have any advice,
do you?

296
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:48,668
No. No. No.

297
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:51,751
I imagine you just have to
start at the bottom of the ladder

298
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:55,126
- and work your way up.
- Do you know what, Mr Buchanan?

299
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:56,293
Hm?

300
00:16:56,418 --> 00:16:58,626
You've just given me
the most brilliant idea.

301
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:02,043
- Have I?
- I'm going to be a window cleaner.

302
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,585
Hmm.

303
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:26,001
Ah!

304
00:17:38,876 --> 00:17:39,876
Oh!

305
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:45,001
Hmm.

306
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:46,835
Ah!

307
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:56,335
Ah.

308
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,876
Hm. Huh?

309
00:17:59,835 --> 00:18:01,126
Oh, dear.

310
00:18:02,043 --> 00:18:04,501
Oh. Um...

311
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:15,376
Hmm...

312
00:18:16,335 --> 00:18:19,043
Ow.

313
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,960
Hello? Anyone?

314
00:18:37,335 --> 00:18:39,335
Wha...

315
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:47,335
Hm?

316
00:18:54,543 --> 00:18:56,918
Hello? Window cleaner.

317
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:58,376
No, thank you.

318
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,335
Are you sure, Colonel?
They're awfully dirty.

319
00:19:01,418 --> 00:19:03,710
I don't care and I'm not paying.

320
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,126
Perhaps I'll do them anyway.

321
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:27,168
Whoo!

322
00:19:53,376 --> 00:19:55,460
Good afternoon, Colonel. Are you aware

323
00:19:55,543 --> 00:19:58,085
- there's a bear on your roof?
- Yes.

324
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,710
He seems to be cleaning my windows.

325
00:19:59,793 --> 00:20:02,168
Shall I do
your gutters while I'm up here?

326
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:04,126
Er, yes. Thank you!

327
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:08,001
Well, of... of course,
it's not for me to say, Colonel,

328
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:10,251
but I wouldn't care
to have an undesirable

329
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,210
crawling all over my premises.

330
00:20:12,293 --> 00:20:14,626
And as commander
of your Community Defence Force...

331
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,001
Is that an official position, Mr Curry?

332
00:20:17,126 --> 00:20:19,710
Or have you just bought yourself
a yellow coat?

333
00:20:22,001 --> 00:20:23,668
Got my eye on you, bear!

334
00:20:24,668 --> 00:20:26,585
Ooh! Sorry.

One more day, Aunt Lucy.

350
00:21:31,626 --> 00:21:33,501
Huh?

351
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,918
Mr Gruber?

352
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:41,418
Eh?

353
00:21:41,543 --> 00:21:42,835
You're not Mr Gruber!

354
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,960
- Clear off!
- Oh, no, you don't.

355
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:54,501
Huh?

356
00:21:57,668 --> 00:21:59,293
Stop! Thief!

357
00:22:02,085 --> 00:22:03,876
Come back with that book!

358
00:22:05,335 --> 00:22:07,418
Robbery in progress
at Gruber's Antiques.

359
00:22:07,501 --> 00:22:11,585
Suspect is a small bear
wearing a red hat and blue duffle coat.

360
00:22:13,626 --> 00:22:15,710
Stop!

361
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,251
Come back!

362
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:24,751
No!

363
00:22:29,168 --> 00:22:31,251
Oop!

364
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:33,460
Come on, Wolfie.

365
00:22:40,543 --> 00:22:41,460
Oi!

366
00:22:42,585 --> 00:22:43,751
Oi, get off it! Go on!

367
00:22:43,835 --> 00:22:46,251
Give that back!

368
00:22:46,376 --> 00:22:48,001
No!

369
00:22:48,126 --> 00:22:49,668
Nice try, bear.

370
00:22:49,793 --> 00:22:51,293
Whoa, Wolfie.

371
00:22:53,543 --> 00:22:54,918
Toodle-oo!

372
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:57,210
Oh! Um...

373
00:22:59,126 --> 00:23:02,960
Ya!

374
00:23:03,043 --> 00:23:04,168
Ow.

375
00:23:05,668 --> 00:23:07,543
Come on, boy. Hup!

376
00:23:09,043 --> 00:23:11,501
Hup! Hup!

377
00:23:11,585 --> 00:23:14,126
- Ow! Ooh!
- Eh?

378
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,001
Excuse me. Coming through.

379
00:23:16,085 --> 00:23:17,543
Who are you? Ooh!

380
00:23:19,668 --> 00:23:21,210
Ooh, dear!

381
00:23:21,293 --> 00:23:23,335
Strike a light!

382
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,460
Ah.

383
00:23:25,585 --> 00:23:28,626
That book is reserved for Aunt Lucy!

384
00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:31,335
Hello there.

385
00:23:31,501 --> 00:23:33,793
Ooh. Ow. Not the snout.

386
00:23:33,918 --> 00:23:35,418
Wolfie!

387
00:23:35,543 --> 00:23:38,460
He-e-e-elp!

388
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:42,085
Oh, thank you, Wolfie.
Now, come on.

389
00:23:42,168 --> 00:23:43,626
Attaboy.

390
00:23:47,335 --> 00:23:49,210
All right, all right.

391
00:23:49,293 --> 00:23:51,918
- You got me.
- Hand over that book.

392
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:54,168
'Fraid I can't do that. Cheerio.

393
00:23:56,126 --> 00:23:58,668
But...

394
00:23:58,793 --> 00:24:01,293
Where did he go?

395
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:04,001
- Hold it right there.
- Oh.

396
00:24:04,085 --> 00:24:07,501
- Thank goodness you're here, Officer.
- Put your... paws in the air.

397
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:09,918
But... But I'm not the thief.

398
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:13,210
I was chasing the thief.
And then he... he...

399
00:24:13,293 --> 00:24:15,126
Disappeared in a puff of smoke?

400
00:24:15,668 --> 00:24:17,626
Well, yes.

401
00:24:35,835 --> 00:24:37,085
- Paddington!
- Oh, no!

402
00:24:37,168 --> 00:24:39,376
- What's going on?
- Hold it there. Hang on.

403
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,043
- We're taking him into custody.
- There must be some mistake.

404
00:24:42,126 --> 00:24:43,710
- No mistake, sir.
- What's happened?

405
00:24:43,793 --> 00:24:45,376
- Caught red-handed.
- What?

406
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,418
- Robbing Gruber's Antiques.
- Well, well, well.

407
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:51,251
The truth is out.

408
00:24:51,335 --> 00:24:53,460
We opened our hearts to that bear.

409
00:24:54,085 --> 00:24:55,710
We opened our doors.

410
00:24:56,293 --> 00:25:00,251
Well, you did. I kept mine triple locked
in accordance with the guidelines.

411
00:25:00,376 --> 00:25:04,293
And all along...
he was robbing you blind.

412
00:25:04,418 --> 00:25:06,835
Paddington!

413
00:25:06,918 --> 00:25:09,001
Oh, no!

414
00:25:09,126 --> 00:25:12,126
- Paddington!
- Oh, dear!

415
00:25:16,876 --> 00:25:19,918
A nice little haul, and no mistake.

416
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:22,043
Turned out to be quite a stroke of luck,

417
00:25:22,168 --> 00:25:24,543
that bear turning up when he did.

418
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:28,460
Coppers think he done it.
We're in the clear.

419
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:33,293
Indeed, Magwitch.

420
00:25:33,376 --> 00:25:36,501
And we gave quite a performance,
you and I.

421
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:40,085
Just like the old days, hm?

422
00:25:40,835 --> 00:25:42,668
Why the lemon face, Hamlet?

423
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:46,376
If you have something to say,
I beg you share it with us all.

424
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,501
"It is not nor it cannot come to good."
Oh, really.

425
00:25:50,585 --> 00:25:52,960
You and your dreary conscience.
Tell me this.

426
00:25:53,043 --> 00:25:55,876
Which would you rather?
That you stand here gathering dust

427
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,460
while I humiliate myself
in a spaniel's costume on television,

428
00:26:00,543 --> 00:26:02,918
or that we all return in glory

429
00:26:03,001 --> 00:26:06,793
in the greatest one-man show
the West End has ever seen?

430
00:26:06,876 --> 00:26:08,668
<i>Bravo!</i>

431
00:26:08,793 --> 00:26:12,460
Oh, thank you, my darlings.
Thank you. Thank you!

432
00:26:12,543 --> 00:26:14,585
Blessings upon you all.

433
00:26:14,668 --> 00:26:17,585
Deepest of bows. Thank you.

434
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,376
I know what you're thinking, Scrooge.
It'll cost a fortune.

435
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,335
But if I'm right, that is exactly
what this book will provide.

436
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:28,293
This is no dusty antique.

437
00:26:28,376 --> 00:26:33,085
Hidden on every page,
a little lady pointing to a clue.

438
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:37,793
Find all the clues... we're rich again.

439
00:26:38,501 --> 00:26:41,501
And our dog-food days are done.

440
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,918
<i>Dinner is served, master.</i>

441
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:46,585
<i>Thank you, Simkins.</i>

442
00:26:46,668 --> 00:26:50,960
<i>If, like me, your doggie
likes to maintain standards,</i>

443
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:53,960
<i>can I recommend
Harley's Gourmet Dindins?</i>

444
00:26:54,043 --> 00:26:57,126
<i>More taste, more goodness, more...</i>

445
00:26:57,585 --> 00:27:00,460
<i>dare one say... class?</i>

446
00:27:01,043 --> 00:27:03,126
<i>- Mmm.
- Harley's Gourmet Dog Food.</i>

447
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:05,918
<i>Not to be consumed by humans.</i>

448
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:09,126
Court will rise.

449
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,335
Deep breath, Paddington.
Remember what Mr Brown said.

450
00:27:12,418 --> 00:27:16,001
"You're young. You've done
nothing wrong. You'll be fine."

451
00:27:16,085 --> 00:27:18,501
"So long as you get
a fair-minded judge."

452
00:27:18,626 --> 00:27:21,126
Order! Order...

453
00:27:25,251 --> 00:27:27,543
- Oh, dear.
- You'll now hear the case

454
00:27:27,668 --> 00:27:31,751
of the Crown
versus Paddington, er... Brown.

455
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,460
Oh, yes, he loved the book.
His heart was set on top of it.

456
00:27:37,543 --> 00:27:41,001
So you discussed how expensive it was?

457
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:43,876
Yes, but he was earning the money.

458
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,585
I refuse to believe that young Mr Brown
would ever burglarise my shop.

459
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,376
Exactly.

460
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:52,001
Paw prints

461
00:27:52,126 --> 00:27:55,876
were found here, here and here.

462
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,585
And a substance
later identified as marmalade

463
00:27:59,418 --> 00:28:00,960
was found here.

464
00:28:01,043 --> 00:28:04,126
And is this the same marmalade?

465
00:28:10,418 --> 00:28:12,543
- Yes, it is.
- Oh, no.

466
00:28:12,668 --> 00:28:15,001
Phoenix Buchanan,
do you swear to tell the truth,

467
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:17,085
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

468
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,710
May my entrails be plucked forth

469
00:28:19,793 --> 00:28:24,251
and wound about my neck
should I deceive. I do.

470
00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:26,668
Prison is no laughing matter.

471
00:28:26,751 --> 00:28:29,668
And I should know,
I spent three years in <i>Les Misérables.</i>

472
00:28:32,126 --> 00:28:36,293
Mr Buchanan. You live on the same street
as the defendant.

473
00:28:36,376 --> 00:28:38,793
- I do.
- And you were an eye witness

474
00:28:38,876 --> 00:28:42,293
- to the events that night.
- Indeed I was.

475
00:28:42,418 --> 00:28:46,585
I was up late, when I became aware
of a hullabaloo in the street below.

476
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:50,668
I went to my awards room
which is a... large room

477
00:28:50,751 --> 00:28:52,501
overlooking the newspaper kiosk.

478
00:28:52,626 --> 00:28:58,210
And I saw young Paddington riding
a rather disreputable-looking hound.

479
00:28:58,293 --> 00:29:00,210
Mary Brown drew this

480
00:29:00,293 --> 00:29:04,126
based on the bear's description
of the man he claims he was chasing.

481
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:06,210
- Hm.
- Did you see him

482
00:29:06,335 --> 00:29:10,376
- on the street that night?
- Oh, a handsome devil, isn't he? Hmm?

483
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:14,001
- Dazzling eyes.
- Yes, but did you see him?

484
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,918
Your answer will tell us
whether the bear is guilty.

485
00:29:18,001 --> 00:29:20,376
Did you see this man?

486
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,543
Alas...

487
00:29:22,876 --> 00:29:24,918
I did not.

488
00:29:25,001 --> 00:29:28,001
But perhaps he'd already vanished.

489
00:29:28,085 --> 00:29:31,126
I beg you, have mercy on him.
He is but a cub!

490
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,793
Paddington Brown.

491
00:29:35,543 --> 00:29:38,793
Ten years for grand theft...

492
00:29:38,918 --> 00:29:40,168
Oh, but...

493
00:29:40,293 --> 00:29:44,001
...and grievous "barberly" harm.

494
00:29:47,293 --> 00:29:48,751
Follow me.

495
00:30:12,168 --> 00:30:15,335
Oh, um...

496
00:30:15,418 --> 00:30:18,960
Mrs Brown usually reads me
a story before bed. I don't suppose...?

497
00:30:19,043 --> 00:30:22,043
Sorry, son. No bedtime stories in here.

498
00:30:22,668 --> 00:30:23,668
Oh.

499
00:30:42,168 --> 00:30:47,126
<i>Dear Aunt Lucy, a great deal
has happened since I last wrote.</i>

500
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,835
<i>There's been a bit of a mix-up
with your present</i>

501
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:54,376
<i>and the upshot is I've had to leave
Windsor Gardens and move...</i>

502
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,126
<i>somewhere else.</i>

503
00:30:57,918 --> 00:31:00,793
<i>It isn't quite as charming
as the Browns' house,</i>

504
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:02,460
<i>but it's not all bad.</i>

505
00:31:02,585 --> 00:31:05,043
<i>It's a period property. In fact,</i>

506
00:31:05,126 --> 00:31:08,918
<i>it's one of the most substantial
Victorian buildings in London.</i>

507
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:12,210
<i>And the security arrangements
are second to none.</i>

508
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:15,626
<i>I'm only allowed to see the Browns
once a month.</i>

509
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:19,043
<i>I wonder what they're doing now.</i>

510
00:31:44,418 --> 00:31:46,668
<i>I do hope they don't forget me.</i>

511
00:31:48,335 --> 00:31:52,335
Of course they won't, Paddington.
This is the Browns you're talking about.

512
00:31:52,418 --> 00:31:53,918
<i>They'll sort everything out,</i>

513
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:56,918
<i>and I'll be able to go home
and get your present,</i>

514
00:31:57,001 --> 00:32:00,210
<i>and everything will be right as rain.</i>

515
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:03,418
I just need to hold on till then.

516
00:32:43,543 --> 00:32:44,543
D.

517
00:32:50,251 --> 00:32:52,043
The hunt begins.

518
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,710
Three-two-five.

519
00:32:58,793 --> 00:33:00,626
Three-two-six.

520
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,668
Three-two-seven.

521
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:05,043
Here goes, Paddington. Manners.

522
00:33:05,126 --> 00:33:06,126
Fall in.

523
00:33:07,168 --> 00:33:10,085
Good morning. How would you like
to start a gardening club?

524
00:33:10,168 --> 00:33:13,918
How would you like to be buried
in a very deep hole?

525
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:15,626
After you.

526
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,085
Spooner, R. Workshop.

527
00:33:19,543 --> 00:33:22,085
Brown, P. Laundry duty.

528
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,835
Right, laundry.

529
00:33:24,918 --> 00:33:27,085
Laundry, laundry... Ah!

530
00:33:27,168 --> 00:33:28,335
Laundry!

531
00:33:31,501 --> 00:33:33,293
Hmm...

532
00:33:33,876 --> 00:33:35,001
Oh!

533
00:33:45,876 --> 00:33:47,126
Ugh!

534
00:33:52,335 --> 00:33:53,335
Oh!

535
00:34:00,668 --> 00:34:01,668
Hmm!

536
00:34:16,876 --> 00:34:18,668
Oh, it's only one red sock.

537
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,043
What's the worst that can happen?

538
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,626
Afternoon, chaps.

539
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:31,626
If you ask me, the... the pink
really brightens the place up a bit.

540
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:35,710
If you ask me, you should pipe down
and enjoy your dinner,

541
00:34:35,793 --> 00:34:37,793
cos it might be your last.

542
00:34:38,585 --> 00:34:40,043
OK.

543
00:34:56,085 --> 00:34:57,835
Ugh!

544
00:34:57,918 --> 00:35:00,626
Ah, don't worry.
I used to be a restaurant critic.

545
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:04,626
- It's not as bad as it looks.
- Oh.

546
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,501
It's worse.

547
00:35:06,585 --> 00:35:09,626
- What is this?
- Nobody knows.

548
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:13,376
But we've been eating it
three times a day for the past ten year.

549
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,418
Why doesn't someone have a word
with the chef?

550
00:35:17,126 --> 00:35:20,460
With Knuckles?

551
00:35:20,543 --> 00:35:23,335
Two things to remember
if you want to survive in here.

552
00:35:23,418 --> 00:35:25,210
Keep your head down.

553
00:35:25,335 --> 00:35:27,251
And never talk to Knuckles.

554
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:30,293
- Thank you.
- Well, I think it's a great idea.

555
00:35:30,418 --> 00:35:33,668
Tell you what, son,
you get Knuckles to change the menu

556
00:35:33,751 --> 00:35:38,376
and we might forget about you making us
look like a bunch of pink flamingos.

557
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,710
- All right then. I will.
- Oh, you don't wanna do that.

558
00:35:41,793 --> 00:35:45,210
Aunt Lucy said, "If you look for
the good in people, you'll find it."

559
00:35:45,293 --> 00:35:48,210
She obviously never met Knuckles.

560
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:57,460
Um, excuse me. Mr Knuckles?

561
00:35:58,835 --> 00:36:00,376
Yes?

562
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,168
I just wondered if I could have
a quick word about the food.

563
00:36:03,251 --> 00:36:05,668
Send a medic to the canteen.

564
00:36:05,751 --> 00:36:07,168
You want to...

565
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:10,043
complain?

566
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:13,376
- Oh, no, I... I wouldn't say complain.
- Oh, that's a shame.

567
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,376
Because I just love it
when people complain.

568
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,543
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

569
00:36:20,626 --> 00:36:24,168
Oh. Well, in that case,
it's very gritty.

570
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:26,210
- Oh?
- And lumpy.

571
00:36:26,293 --> 00:36:28,460
And as for the bread...

572
00:36:28,543 --> 00:36:30,251
Need I say more?

573
00:36:30,335 --> 00:36:33,210
I think we need to completely
overhaul the menu. Now...

574
00:36:33,293 --> 00:36:36,918
I know we're working to a tight budget,
but we could at least add some sauce.

575
00:36:37,001 --> 00:36:40,335
Oh, sorry about that. I'll just, er...

576
00:36:40,918 --> 00:36:44,001
Hmm. No, that's just rubbing it in.

577
00:36:45,126 --> 00:36:47,960
Don't worry.
I know what gets ketchup stains out.

578
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:51,918
Hang on. Was it mustard?

579
00:36:53,126 --> 00:36:54,668
Hmm... no.

580
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,168
That's just made it worse!

581
00:36:57,251 --> 00:36:59,710
Does anyone know what works on ketchup?

582
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:01,335
Chaps?

583
00:37:05,543 --> 00:37:07,918
Forget the medic. Better send a priest.

584
00:37:08,001 --> 00:37:10,793
- You listen to me, you little maggot.
- Listening.

585
00:37:10,876 --> 00:37:14,043
- Nobody criticises my food.
- Right.

586
00:37:14,126 --> 00:37:17,626
Nobody squirts condiments on my apron.

587
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,251
- Got it.
- And nobody

588
00:37:19,335 --> 00:37:22,126
bonks me on the head
with a baguette.

589
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:24,585
- No bonking.
- I'll overhaul the menu all right.

590
00:37:24,668 --> 00:37:26,085
- Really?
- Dish of the day.

591
00:37:26,168 --> 00:37:27,668
- Yes?
- Bear pie!

592
00:37:27,751 --> 00:37:29,793
I don't like it!

593
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:50,460
- What is this?
- It's a marmalade sandwich.

594
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,710
Marmalade?

595
00:37:52,793 --> 00:37:55,335
My Aunt Lucy taught me to make them.

596
00:37:55,418 --> 00:37:57,293
You mean, you can make this?

597
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:00,418
- Well, yes.
- Stand aside.

598
00:38:01,668 --> 00:38:06,168
Get up off the floor,
you bunch of yellow-bellies!

599
00:38:06,293 --> 00:38:10,585
Listen to me.
This bear is now under my protection.

600
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:14,043
- Oh?
- Anyone who touches a hair on his back

601
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:17,001
will answer to Knuckles McGinty.

602
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:20,710
That's Knuckles with a capital N.

603
00:38:22,918 --> 00:38:25,918
- Thank you, Mr McGinty.
- Don't thank me yet.

604
00:38:26,543 --> 00:38:29,293
I don't do nothin' for no one
for nothin'.

605
00:38:29,876 --> 00:38:30,876
Beg your pardon?

606
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:37,918
You get my protection, so long as
you make that marmalade. Deal?

607
00:38:38,918 --> 00:38:41,085
Deal.

608
00:38:48,376 --> 00:38:51,335
Somebody's got to recognise him
sooner or later.

609
00:38:51,418 --> 00:38:53,085
Hmm.

610
00:38:53,168 --> 00:38:54,710
You all right, Mr Gruber?

611
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:57,293
There's something
about this whole business

612
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:00,251
- that has been tickling my brainbox.
- What is it?

613
00:39:00,335 --> 00:39:03,960
On the night of the robbery,
when young Mr Brown called out,

614
00:39:04,043 --> 00:39:07,126
the thief took to his heels
and ran down the stairs.

615
00:39:07,251 --> 00:39:10,001
Came straight through the shop
and out the front door,

616
00:39:10,085 --> 00:39:12,001
setting off the alarm.

617
00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:15,543
Ah, but that's the thing.
He didn't go straight through the shop.

618
00:39:15,626 --> 00:39:17,335
- No?
- He came all the way over here

619
00:39:17,418 --> 00:39:19,460
to get the popping book.

620
00:39:19,543 --> 00:39:22,043
Why not some jewellery or a vase?

621
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,210
They're much closer. Far more valuable.

622
00:39:24,293 --> 00:39:26,501
He can't know much about antiques.

623
00:39:26,585 --> 00:39:29,710
No. Unless...

624
00:39:30,293 --> 00:39:33,043
he knows something about that book
that we don't.

625
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:38,418
You may find this hard
to believe, Madame Kozlova,

626
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,168
but Paddington is innocent.

627
00:39:40,251 --> 00:39:43,210
And we think that the real thief
may have broken into Mr Gruber's

628
00:39:43,335 --> 00:39:46,043
just to steal
your great-grandmother's pop-up book.

629
00:39:46,126 --> 00:39:48,793
- The pop-up book?
- I know it sounds far-fetched.

630
00:39:48,876 --> 00:39:51,501
But is there anything
you could tell us about that book?

631
00:39:51,585 --> 00:39:53,501
Anything at all could be helpful.

632
00:39:54,876 --> 00:39:57,835
- That's quite a story.
- Oh, really?

633
00:39:59,126 --> 00:40:00,251
Come with me.

634
00:40:01,085 --> 00:40:03,543
I'll show you where it all happened.

635
00:40:04,043 --> 00:40:08,210
<i>You see, my great-grandmother,
who started this fair,</i>

636
00:40:08,335 --> 00:40:11,585
<i>was the finest show woman
of her generation.</i>

637
00:40:11,668 --> 00:40:15,501
<i>She could tame lions,
breathe fire, swallow swords.</i>

638
00:40:15,585 --> 00:40:19,168
<i>But she was most famous...
for the trapeze.</i>

639
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,876
<i>- They called her the Flying Swan.</i>
- Bravo!

640
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,293
<i>Wherever she went,
she was showered with gifts,</i>

641
00:40:27,376 --> 00:40:29,585
<i>and made a fortune.</i>

642
00:40:29,668 --> 00:40:34,376
<i>But where there is a fortune,
there is also jealousy.</i>

643
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,293
<i>The magician wanted it for himself.</i>

644
00:40:38,251 --> 00:40:40,835
<i>And the Flying Swan...</i>

645
00:40:42,585 --> 00:40:45,460
<i>...became the Dying Swan.</i>

646
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:51,543
<i>He went to her caravan
and opened her strongbox.</i>

647
00:40:51,626 --> 00:40:53,710
<i>But instead of her treasure,</i>

648
00:40:53,793 --> 00:40:57,918
<i>all he found was one
of her pop-up books.</i>

649
00:40:58,001 --> 00:41:01,043
<i>"Twelve Landmarks of London."</i>

650
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:05,751
<i>They had him cornered,
but he vanished.</i>

651
00:41:05,835 --> 00:41:10,918
<i>And neither he nor the treasure
were ever heard of again.</i>

652
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:14,460
I knew there was something special
about that pop-up book.

653
00:41:14,543 --> 00:41:15,543
Hmm?

654
00:41:15,626 --> 00:41:17,876
Why else would she have kept it
in her strongbox?

655
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,376
You're not telling me
you believed all that guff, are you?

656
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:23,335
Madame Kozlova drew
12 London landmarks in that book.

657
00:41:23,418 --> 00:41:24,460
Yes?

658
00:41:24,543 --> 00:41:27,918
Well, what if they're not
just landmarks? What if they're...

659
00:41:28,001 --> 00:41:31,460
- I don't know, clues?
- Clues?

660
00:41:31,543 --> 00:41:34,251
- To where she hid her fortune.
- You mean a treasure map?

661
00:41:34,335 --> 00:41:35,751
- Exactly!
- Oh...

662
00:41:35,835 --> 00:41:38,001
And that's why the thief
took it from Mr Gruber's.

663
00:41:38,126 --> 00:41:41,293
First thing tomorrow, we need to go
to every landmark in that book.

664
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,835
See if we can sniff out
anything suspicious.

665
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,668
- Too many adventure stories, Mary.
- What?

666
00:41:46,751 --> 00:41:48,210
She's a fortune teller.

667
00:41:48,293 --> 00:41:50,210
She spun you a yarn. It's what they do.

668
00:41:50,293 --> 00:41:52,876
Honestly, Henry,
you're so closed-minded these days.

669
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,460
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What happened to the man I married?

670
00:41:56,543 --> 00:41:58,918
- He'd have believed me.
- Oh, him.

671
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:00,710
- He's gone.
- What?

672
00:42:00,793 --> 00:42:03,335
I'm afraid your husband's
just a creaky old man.

673
00:42:03,418 --> 00:42:05,835
- He's not Bullseye Brown.
- Oh, Lord.

674
00:42:05,918 --> 00:42:08,460
<i>♪ I'm crazy like a fool</i>

675
00:42:09,751 --> 00:42:12,001
<i>♪ What about it, Daddy Cool?</i>

676
00:42:13,293 --> 00:42:16,043
<i>♪ Daddy, Daddy Cool</i>

677
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:19,626
<i>♪ Daddy, Daddy Cool</i>

678
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,793
Bullseye.

679
00:42:20,876 --> 00:42:22,501
Oh, Henry.

680
00:42:22,585 --> 00:42:24,335
<i>♪ She's crazy about her Daddy</i>

681
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:26,460
Henry? Henry!

682
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:29,001
Anyway, the point is,
we're not going to help Paddington

683
00:42:29,085 --> 00:42:30,710
by going on a wild-goose chase.

684
00:42:30,793 --> 00:42:34,168
We're looking for this scruffy chancer,
not some swashbuckling pirate

685
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:35,918
hunting for buried treasure.

686
00:42:36,793 --> 00:42:40,043
I think there's more to him
than meets the eye.

687
00:42:40,168 --> 00:42:43,751
I think he somehow knew the story
of the Koslova fortune

688
00:42:43,835 --> 00:42:46,460
<i>and is out there right now
trying to find it.</i>

689
00:42:47,585 --> 00:42:49,210
Well, Grandfather,

690
00:42:49,793 --> 00:42:53,460
tonight we go in search
of clue number two.

691
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,876
The setting,

692
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,876
<i>St Paul's Cathedral.</i>

693
00:42:58,626 --> 00:43:01,001
<i>But how to slip in unobserved.</i>

694
00:43:01,793 --> 00:43:04,585
<i>Enter Sister Isabella.</i>

695
00:43:15,001 --> 00:43:17,668
Wakey-wakey.

696
00:43:17,751 --> 00:43:19,918
Marmalade time.

697
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:24,918
There you go, lads. Good luck.

698
00:43:25,001 --> 00:43:27,835
- Um, Mr McGinty?
- What do you want?

699
00:43:27,918 --> 00:43:30,335
Well, the thing is,
I'm actually innocent.

700
00:43:30,418 --> 00:43:32,751
And I wondered if you had any advice

701
00:43:32,835 --> 00:43:34,960
on how to clear my name,
now that we're friends.

702
00:43:35,043 --> 00:43:37,918
Friends?
I'm your boss, not your buddy.

703
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:40,876
Oh. Well, after you.

704
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,668
Why? So you can stab me in the back?

705
00:43:43,751 --> 00:43:46,585
No. Because it's polite.

706
00:43:46,668 --> 00:43:49,793
Aunt Lucy said, "If we're kind
and polite, the world will be right."

707
00:43:49,876 --> 00:43:52,335
You were ahead of me
and now you're behind.

708
00:43:52,418 --> 00:43:54,168
That makes you a sap.

709
00:43:54,251 --> 00:43:56,793
Ingredients are over there.

710
00:43:56,876 --> 00:43:59,293
Um, aren't you going to help?

711
00:43:59,376 --> 00:44:01,710
Nope. Now get on with it.

712
00:44:01,793 --> 00:44:04,293
But there's 500 hungry prisoners
coming for breakfast.

713
00:44:04,376 --> 00:44:06,335
So we'll need a thousand juicy oranges.

714
00:44:06,418 --> 00:44:09,626
Oh, and rule number one: no talking.

715
00:44:15,918 --> 00:44:18,001
- Rule number two.
- Hmm?

716
00:44:18,626 --> 00:44:19,668
No humming.

717
00:44:19,751 --> 00:44:20,918
- But...
- Or singing.

718
00:44:21,001 --> 00:44:24,918
- I...
- Or any other expression of bonhomie.

719
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:41,210
Oh, dear.

720
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:45,126
Ooh, that's heavy.

721
00:44:47,168 --> 00:44:49,835
Come on,
put your back into it.

722
00:44:49,918 --> 00:44:51,001
Oh!

723
00:44:51,876 --> 00:44:54,376
Help!

724
00:44:55,668 --> 00:44:57,210
These sacks are awfully heavy.

725
00:44:57,293 --> 00:44:59,668
- Well, take them one at a time, then.
- Right.

726
00:44:59,751 --> 00:45:00,793
One at a...

727
00:45:00,876 --> 00:45:01,876
...time.

728
00:45:09,251 --> 00:45:12,001
One juicy orange.

729
00:45:15,626 --> 00:45:17,251
Two juicy oranges.

730
00:45:19,835 --> 00:45:23,251
Three juicy oranges.

731
00:45:24,418 --> 00:45:26,168
- Four juicy...
- Now what are you doing?

732
00:45:26,251 --> 00:45:27,876
Taking them one at a time.

733
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,210
One sack at a time!

734
00:45:30,293 --> 00:45:33,335
I'm sorry. I'm finding this
a very stressful working environment.

735
00:45:33,418 --> 00:45:35,335
- Aunt Lucy said...
- Aunt Lucy!

736
00:45:35,418 --> 00:45:38,001
- I've had it up to here with Aunt Lucy!
- Oh!

737
00:45:38,085 --> 00:45:39,918
She sounds like a proper old bag to me.

738
00:45:42,418 --> 00:45:44,626
I beg your pardon?

739
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,335
I said...

740
00:45:47,418 --> 00:45:51,543
your Aunt Lucy sounds like
one of the most naive,

741
00:45:51,626 --> 00:45:54,918
gullible, mushy-brained...

742
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,251
What's going on?

743
00:45:59,126 --> 00:46:01,126
Why are you looking at me like that?

744
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,960
It's awful hot in here.
Are you hot? I'm hot.

745
00:46:07,043 --> 00:46:08,376
Did I leave the oven on?

746
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,251
It's called a hard stare.

747
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:15,043
Aunt Lucy taught me to do them
when people had forgotten their manners.

748
00:46:15,126 --> 00:46:17,085
You don't have to tell me
about hard stares.

749
00:46:17,168 --> 00:46:18,668
I practically invented them.

750
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,043
Pretty good for a bear though,
I'll give you that.

751
00:46:22,126 --> 00:46:23,460
Now, Mr McGinty,

752
00:46:23,543 --> 00:46:27,126
I may look like a hardened criminal
to you, but I really am innocent.

753
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:29,210
And if you're not going to help me
clear my name,

754
00:46:29,293 --> 00:46:31,501
you could at least
help me make this marmalade.

755
00:46:31,585 --> 00:46:34,251
All right, I'll help.

756
00:46:34,335 --> 00:46:36,751
- Thank you.
- Not gonna be much use to you though.

757
00:46:37,543 --> 00:46:39,585
These weren't exactly made for cooking.

758
00:46:39,668 --> 00:46:41,251
I don't know.

759
00:46:41,335 --> 00:46:44,543
Looks to me like you've got yourself
a fine pair of orange squeezers.

760
00:46:45,085 --> 00:46:46,876
Orange squeezers?

761
00:46:50,335 --> 00:46:52,293
Good.

762
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,043
No. Better.

763
00:46:54,126 --> 00:46:56,251
Tomato. Lovely.

764
00:46:56,335 --> 00:46:59,543
Yes. Spot on.

765
00:46:59,626 --> 00:47:01,835
Now, we have to be very careful
with knives.

766
00:47:01,918 --> 00:47:04,918
Aunt Lucy said that sensible bears...

767
00:47:05,543 --> 00:47:07,918
Where on earth did you learn
to use a knife like that?

768
00:47:08,001 --> 00:47:10,501
You don't wanna know.

769
00:47:10,585 --> 00:47:12,168
Well, it's jolly good.

770
00:47:13,626 --> 00:47:15,793
Now?

771
00:47:15,876 --> 00:47:17,126
Now.

772
00:47:19,043 --> 00:47:21,376
- Right, it's time for the sugar.
- OK.

773
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,710
That's what turns the juice
into marmalade.

774
00:47:23,793 --> 00:47:26,001
- How much?
- Ooh, a lot.

775
00:47:26,751 --> 00:47:29,293
Same again.

776
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,460
Ah.

777
00:47:32,085 --> 00:47:35,710
A squeeze of lemon. A pinch of cinnamon.

778
00:47:36,335 --> 00:47:38,418
And just a bit more sugar.

779
00:47:39,001 --> 00:47:41,668
Well, is it good?

780
00:47:41,751 --> 00:47:45,251
Ooh, it's too soon to tell.
We'll only really know once it's set.

781
00:47:47,835 --> 00:47:49,585
Designed by Sir Christopher Wren,

782
00:47:49,668 --> 00:47:53,043
St Paul's Cathedral is one
of London's most famous landmarks.

783
00:47:53,126 --> 00:47:56,085
Sadly the Great Dome
is closed to visitors today

784
00:47:56,168 --> 00:48:00,168
as one of its statues was destroyed
in a bizarre accident last night.

785
00:48:00,251 --> 00:48:03,251
- But if you follow me this way...
- Excuse me, what happened here?

786
00:48:03,335 --> 00:48:06,210
- A nun went berserk.
- Really?

787
00:48:06,293 --> 00:48:07,626
It happens.

788
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:10,710
The police have rounded them all up
for questioning.

789
00:48:10,793 --> 00:48:12,251
Hold it there, Sister!

790
00:48:12,335 --> 00:48:14,835
You're going nowhere
till the detective says so.

791
00:48:14,918 --> 00:48:16,710
Spin it around!

792
00:48:18,668 --> 00:48:23,876
Mind you, if you ask me,
the real culprit slipped the net.

793
00:48:24,376 --> 00:48:25,585
What makes you say that?

794
00:48:25,668 --> 00:48:28,376
Cos I saw her, that's what.

795
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:33,168
<i>I was on patrol in the Upper Dome,
watching the nuns parade far below,</i>

796
00:48:33,251 --> 00:48:35,918
<i>when something caught my eye.</i>

797
00:48:36,001 --> 00:48:37,876
<i>One of them broke free from the herd.</i>

798
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,835
<i>and made her way
to the Whispering Gallery.</i>

799
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:48,335
<i>Only the good Lord knows
what she was doing up there.</i>

800
00:48:48,418 --> 00:48:49,710
C.

801
00:48:51,085 --> 00:48:53,293
<i>But she was never
gonna get away with it.</i>

802
00:48:53,376 --> 00:48:55,710
<i>Not while I'm vice deputy head
of security.</i>

803
00:48:55,793 --> 00:48:57,251
Oi!

804
00:49:04,293 --> 00:49:06,668
Attention all units,
an unusually attractive nun

805
00:49:06,751 --> 00:49:10,335
is causing mayhem in the cathedral dome.
Activate emergency protocol.

806
00:49:10,418 --> 00:49:12,418
Stop that stunning sister!

807
00:49:12,501 --> 00:49:15,668
<i>I set off at lightning speed.</i>

808
00:49:16,126 --> 00:49:20,460
<i>But by the time we'd locked the place
down, she'd vanished into the night.</i>

809
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:23,460
- Good evening, my son.
- Oh, er, good evening, Your Grace.

810
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:24,668
Good evening.

811
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,501
Most beautiful woman I've seen

812
00:49:28,585 --> 00:49:31,501
in a lo-o-o-ong time.

813
00:49:31,585 --> 00:49:34,668
Do you think you might be able
to describe her?

814
00:49:34,751 --> 00:49:37,210
It would be my pleasure.

815
00:49:41,585 --> 00:49:44,251
Gentlemen, for breakfast this morning,

816
00:49:44,335 --> 00:49:47,168
Chef McGinty would like to propose
an orange marmalade...

817
00:49:47,251 --> 00:49:48,543
...served on a bed

818
00:49:48,626 --> 00:49:50,835
of warm crustless bread

819
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,418
topped with another piece
of warm... crustless bread.

820
00:49:56,418 --> 00:49:57,543
<i>Bon appétit!</i>

821
00:50:00,001 --> 00:50:02,835
Two choices: take it or leave it!

822
00:50:05,626 --> 00:50:08,126
Are you all right, Knuckles?

823
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:09,210
Yes!

824
00:50:09,793 --> 00:50:11,751
Why don't you come and join the others?

825
00:50:11,835 --> 00:50:12,835
Don't want to.

826
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,376
- Are you scared what they might think?
- No!

827
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:19,001
What do they think? Did they like it?
Did they say anything?

828
00:50:19,085 --> 00:50:20,460
- What did they say?
- Well...

829
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,501
They hated it! I knew it!

830
00:50:22,585 --> 00:50:25,876
My father always said
I'd amount to nothing and he was right!

831
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,168
Knuckles. Knuckles!

832
00:50:28,251 --> 00:50:30,876
- What?
- Come and look.

833
00:50:51,793 --> 00:50:52,793
Come on.

834
00:51:11,126 --> 00:51:12,793
- Paddington.
- Hm?

835
00:51:12,918 --> 00:51:15,710
I've a strange, warm tingle
in my tum-tum.

836
00:51:15,793 --> 00:51:18,085
I think that's called pride, Knuckles.

837
00:51:18,168 --> 00:51:20,335
Well, I don't like it.

838
00:51:23,335 --> 00:51:26,460
Um, have...
have you got anything else?

839
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,293
- What?
- You know, for, um... pudding?

840
00:51:30,376 --> 00:51:32,043
- No!
- Fair enough.

841
00:51:32,126 --> 00:51:34,126
I'm afraid we only know
how to make marmalade.

842
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:36,293
- Hmm.
- But if you have any recipes...

843
00:51:36,376 --> 00:51:38,835
This lot? You're wasting
your time there, Paddington.

844
00:51:38,918 --> 00:51:42,335
They wouldn't know
their pectin from their paprika.

845
00:51:43,335 --> 00:51:46,376
Well, my grandmother
used to do a lovely chocolate roulade.

846
00:51:47,168 --> 00:51:48,918
I think I can remember the recipe.

847
00:51:49,001 --> 00:51:50,126
Ooh.

848
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:53,168
Charley Rumble
makes a mean apple crumble.

849
00:51:56,168 --> 00:51:58,876
And I can make
a strawberry panna cotta...

850
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,335
...with a pomegranate glaze.

851
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:04,668
Oh, I like the sound of that.
Don't you, Knuckles?

852
00:52:04,751 --> 00:52:06,918
- Yeah!
- Come on, then.

853
00:52:07,001 --> 00:52:08,751
Let's get cooking.

854
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:11,918
<i>♪ If this little proverb

- Ooh, Knuckles.

861
00:52:25,793 --> 00:52:27,668
I want those petit fours now!

862
00:52:27,793 --> 00:52:30,793

- What would Aunt Lucy say?
- "Always use a cake fork."

868
00:52:44,001 --> 00:52:46,543
Well, then.

869
00:52:46,626 --> 00:52:50,710
<i>♪ We wonder if there is

871
00:52:54,668 --> 00:52:57,126
Mmm, butterscotch!

872
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:02,251

<i>wasn't such a monster after all.</i>

880
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:31,168
And they all became the best of friends.

881
00:53:31,251 --> 00:53:34,585
- The end.
<i>- Aww!</i>

882
00:53:34,668 --> 00:53:36,918
Uh! Time for bed, you lot.

883
00:53:37,001 --> 00:53:39,543
<i>You need your beauty sleep.</i>

884
00:53:39,626 --> 00:53:41,335
<i>It's visiting day tomorrow.</i>

885
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:42,876
Visiting day?

886
00:53:44,001 --> 00:53:46,001
I do hope you have good news.

887
00:53:51,085 --> 00:53:54,876
In the past month,
these three shadowy individuals

888
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,751
have all been seen
snooping around three London landmarks.

889
00:53:57,835 --> 00:53:59,418
- Oh.
- We think the thief you saw

890
00:53:59,501 --> 00:54:01,585
- is part of a criminal gang.
- Using the pop-up book

891
00:54:01,668 --> 00:54:03,585
- as a treasure map.
- Well, it's a theory.

892
00:54:03,668 --> 00:54:06,168
- Have you found out who they are?
- Not yet, dearie.

893
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:09,293
Maybe I should take a look.

894
00:54:10,001 --> 00:54:11,918
I'm sorry,
this is a private conversation.

895
00:54:12,001 --> 00:54:14,501
Oh, it's all right, Mr Brown,
this is my friend, Knuckles.

896
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:15,835
- How are you?
- This is Phibs.

897
00:54:15,918 --> 00:54:16,918
- G'day.
- Spoon.

898
00:54:17,001 --> 00:54:18,126
- Hello.
- Jimmy the Snitch.

899
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:19,251
- All right?
- T-Bone.

900
00:54:19,335 --> 00:54:21,168
- Wotcher.
- The Professor. Squeaky Pete.

901
00:54:21,251 --> 00:54:22,376
- Double Bass Bob.
- Hello.

902
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:23,418
- Farmer Jack.
- How do?

903
00:54:23,501 --> 00:54:24,501
- Mad Dog.
- Woof!

904
00:54:24,585 --> 00:54:26,001
- Johnny Cashpoint.
- Kerching!

905
00:54:26,085 --> 00:54:28,293
- Sir Geoffrey Willcot.
- I hope I can rely on your vote.

906
00:54:28,376 --> 00:54:30,918
And Charley Rumble.

907
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:33,335
Oh, it's so wonderful to meet you all.

908
00:54:33,418 --> 00:54:35,835
I must say, it's a great relief

909
00:54:35,918 --> 00:54:39,460
to know that Paddington's already made
such sweet friends.

910
00:54:39,543 --> 00:54:41,126
Would you excuse us a moment?

911
00:54:43,293 --> 00:54:46,210
- What are you doing?
- Talking to the nice men.

912
00:54:46,293 --> 00:54:49,793
Nice men?
Mary, we can't trust these people.

913
00:54:49,876 --> 00:54:54,085
I mean, look at them.
Talk about a rogues' gallery. Hideous!

914
00:54:54,168 --> 00:54:57,126
As for that bearded baboon in the
middle, he's hardly got two brain cells

915
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:00,210
- to rub together.
- We can still hear you, Mr Brown.

916
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,460
That was the light you turned off.

917
00:55:04,543 --> 00:55:09,793
The microphone is on the other side.
It's got "microphone" written on it.

918
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:16,210
Gentlemen,
if I have offended you in any way...

919
00:55:16,293 --> 00:55:19,126
Don't worry about it.
We're fond of the little fella.

920
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:23,126
And let's face it, if anyone
can recognise a criminal gang, it's us.

921
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:25,793
We'd be grateful for any help.

922
00:55:25,876 --> 00:55:28,793
- Please.
- Well? Knuckles?

923
00:55:28,876 --> 00:55:31,876
I'm afraid I don't recognise
any of them. Lads?

924
00:55:33,126 --> 00:55:35,626
I'm afraid I couldn't possibly comment.

925
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:37,126
Sorry to say it, kid,

926
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:39,501
but your friends
are barking up the wrong tree.

927
00:55:39,585 --> 00:55:42,210
A nun, a beefeater and a king?

928
00:55:42,293 --> 00:55:45,960
Sounds more like a fancy dress party
than a criminal gang.

929
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:47,085
Then...

930
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,751
what are we going to do now?

931
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,335
Oh!

932
00:56:00,418 --> 00:56:02,376
- Watch where you're going.
- So sorry. Sorry.

933
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:05,085
Sorry, I get grumpy
when I haven't had breakfast.

934
00:56:07,751 --> 00:56:10,876
Keys... Keys. Keys!

935
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,960
Bottoms!

936
00:56:13,418 --> 00:56:15,543
- Turn left...
- You can't park here!

937
00:56:15,668 --> 00:56:18,043
I'm not parked, I'm doing the bins.

938
00:56:18,126 --> 00:56:20,418
You're not doing the bins, sunshine.

939
00:56:20,501 --> 00:56:23,376
You're studying on council time.

940
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:26,418
I'm gonna report you. And your hat.

941
00:56:26,501 --> 00:56:29,251
- Morning, Miss Kitts, Colonel.
- Oh, morning, Mrs Brown.

942
00:56:29,335 --> 00:56:31,251
Judy asked me to drop these off to you.

943
00:56:31,335 --> 00:56:33,001
Propaganda!

944
00:56:33,085 --> 00:56:36,085
You are wasting your time
trying to peddle that rubbish.

945
00:56:36,835 --> 00:56:39,668
Everyone round here
knows it was your bear that done it.

946
00:56:39,751 --> 00:56:42,793
And this street
is a far, far better place without him.

947
00:56:42,876 --> 00:56:45,085
What?

948
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:48,793
Oi, it's that mangy dog!
You are going to the pound, my son.

949
00:56:48,876 --> 00:56:50,710
Barking without a licence
in a built-up area.

950
00:56:50,793 --> 00:56:52,626
- Give 'em here.
- I'll ticket you!

951
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:55,085
I have to sell them under the counter
for obvious reasons,

952
00:56:55,168 --> 00:56:56,501
but people are buying 'em.

953
00:56:56,585 --> 00:56:58,918
- Really?
- It's a bloomin' good read. Hm.

954
00:56:59,001 --> 00:57:01,751
Made a few people round here think twice
about your young bear.

955
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,085
You just need to find that thief.

956
00:57:04,168 --> 00:57:05,918
Oh, we're trying.

957
00:57:06,001 --> 00:57:08,876
Don't suppose you know where he is,
do you, Feathers?

958
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,751
He's behind you.

959
00:57:11,376 --> 00:57:13,960
- Sorry, what?
- Coo-ee!

960
00:57:14,543 --> 00:57:16,710
- Mary?
- Oh, hello, Phoenix.

961
00:57:16,793 --> 00:57:17,835
Why don't you come on in?

962
00:57:17,918 --> 00:57:21,001
I want to hear all about
the investigation. Yeah?

963
00:57:21,918 --> 00:57:24,668
Mysterious things
have been happening all over town.

964
00:57:24,751 --> 00:57:25,751
Oh, yes?

965
00:57:25,835 --> 00:57:28,960
Strange characters turning up
at every landmark in that book.

966
00:57:29,043 --> 00:57:31,835
- Are they?
- I don't know.

967
00:57:32,501 --> 00:57:34,126
Perhaps it's just a coincidence.

968
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:37,251
Henry says I let my imagination
get the better of me.

969
00:57:37,335 --> 00:57:39,418
Well, you're an artist, Mary, like me.

970
00:57:39,501 --> 00:57:44,126
Our imaginations run free
like bison upon the plain.

971
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,918
But can I just say,
in this particular case,

972
00:57:47,001 --> 00:57:49,418
I think dear old Henry
might have a point.

973
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,960
- Do you?
- But, I do have

974
00:57:52,043 --> 00:57:55,251
a little bit of good news
that might turn your frown upside down.

975
00:57:55,418 --> 00:57:56,668
- Oh, yes?
- It looks...

976
00:57:56,751 --> 00:57:58,293
fingers, fingers, fingers,

977
00:57:58,376 --> 00:58:01,043
as though the funding may be
coming through for my one-man show.

978
00:58:01,126 --> 00:58:04,293
- Oh. Right.
- It's an evening of monologue and song,

979
00:58:04,376 --> 00:58:06,293
featuring some of
my better known characters.

980
00:58:06,376 --> 00:58:08,168
Would you like a little preview?

981
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:09,418
Um...

982
00:58:09,501 --> 00:58:13,793
Picture this scene.
Darkness, then suddenly, spotlight.

983
00:58:13,876 --> 00:58:15,418
Me... ping!

984
00:58:15,501 --> 00:58:18,543
<i>♪ Listen to the rain on the roof</i>

985
00:58:18,626 --> 00:58:21,626
<i>♪ Go pit pitty pat, pit pitty pat sit</i>

986
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:25,376
Oh, Mary, you look sad.
You don't like musicals?

987
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,710
No. No, no, no.
I suppose it just seems so unfair.

988
00:58:28,793 --> 00:58:31,043
Paddington's in prison and yet...

989
00:58:31,835 --> 00:58:34,793
- life carries on.
- Oh, I know.

990
00:58:34,876 --> 00:58:38,460
It must be so hard to accept
that he won,

991
00:58:38,585 --> 00:58:41,335
that man with the dazzling blue eyes.

992
00:58:41,418 --> 00:58:44,126
I beg your pardon?

993
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:46,876
The man in the poster.
Your wonderful drawing.

994
00:58:47,668 --> 00:58:50,418
Yes, but...
how do <i>you</i> know he had blue eyes?

995
00:58:51,376 --> 00:58:54,210
- Hm?
- It's just a pencil sketch.

996
00:58:59,001 --> 00:59:00,001
Ooh.

997
00:59:01,001 --> 00:59:04,876
Well, I must have coloured him in.

998
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,543
- Yeah.
<i>- Phoenix Buchanan?</i>

999
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,626
He's a master of disguise.

1000
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:10,835
- She's gone mad.
- Think about it, Henry.

1001
00:59:10,918 --> 00:59:13,335
Someone out there knows
about the Kozlova fortune, right?

1002
00:59:13,418 --> 00:59:14,668
Alleged fortune.

1003
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:16,960
Knuckles said we weren't looking
for a criminal gang.

1004
00:59:17,043 --> 00:59:18,835
- Knuckles?
- Because there was no gang.

1005
00:59:18,918 --> 00:59:22,126
- It was one man.
- Feathers knew all along...

1006
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:24,585
- Feathers? Who's Feathers?
- Hm?

1007
00:59:24,668 --> 00:59:28,585
- The parrot at the news-stand?
- No...

1008
00:59:28,668 --> 00:59:31,126
Can we just return to Planet Earth
for a moment?

1009
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:35,335
Phoenix Buchanan is a highly respected,
award-winning actor

1010
00:59:35,418 --> 00:59:37,418
and a member of our Platinum Club.

1011
00:59:37,543 --> 00:59:40,376
- He is not a petty thief.
- Hang on a minute, Henry...

1012
00:59:40,501 --> 00:59:42,293
But let's just assume I'm wrong,
shall we?

1013
00:59:42,376 --> 00:59:44,585
- OK.
- And that the fortune teller,

1014
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:47,835
- career criminal and parrot are right.
- Mm.

1015
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:50,960
May I remind you
that you don't actually have any proof?

1016
00:59:51,043 --> 00:59:53,543
- Er...
- Now, if anyone wants me,

1017
00:59:53,626 --> 00:59:55,335
I shall be putting up posters.

1018
00:59:56,585 --> 00:59:58,043
He's right.

1019
00:59:58,126 --> 01:00:00,251
Well, I believe you, Mary.

1020
01:00:01,043 --> 01:00:06,876
Actors are some of the most evil,
devious people on the planet.

1021
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,126
- Are they?
- They lie for a living.

1022
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:11,210
Crikey.

1023
01:00:11,293 --> 01:00:13,293
- If we're gonna catch one...
- Yes?

1024
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:15,418
...we're gonna need a foolproof plan.

1025
01:00:16,418 --> 01:00:18,043
Oh.

1026
01:00:23,668 --> 01:00:25,376
Hm?

1027
01:00:27,293 --> 01:00:29,168
- Paddington?
- Oh.

1028
01:00:31,043 --> 01:00:34,168
Paddington?

1029
01:00:36,293 --> 01:00:37,501
Knuckles?

1030
01:00:37,585 --> 01:00:39,710
Got a proposition for you, kid.

1031
01:00:39,793 --> 01:00:43,668
Me and the boys have been talking
and seems to us,

1032
01:00:43,751 --> 01:00:46,793
if you're gonna clear your name,
you're gonna need our help.

1033
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:48,668
The Browns may mean well but...

1034
01:00:48,751 --> 01:00:52,793
- It takes a thief to catch a thief.
- Ohh.

1035
01:00:52,876 --> 01:00:56,918
Now, if we could figure a way
out of here and hit the streets,

1036
01:00:57,001 --> 01:00:58,876
we'd find this guy soon enough.

1037
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,918
But that would mean... escape.

1038
01:01:02,001 --> 01:01:04,335
It certainly would. And we got a plan.

1039
01:01:04,418 --> 01:01:07,043
But it's a four-man job
so we need your help.

1040
01:01:07,501 --> 01:01:08,668
What do you say, kid?

1041
01:01:09,293 --> 01:01:11,168
It's very kind of you, Knuckles, but...

1042
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:13,626
I don't think Aunt Lucy
would like the idea of us...

1043
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:15,668
breaking out of prison.

1044
01:01:15,751 --> 01:01:19,626
The Browns will find the real thief.
I just need to be patient.

1045
01:01:20,126 --> 01:01:21,876
You may not wanna hear this, kid,

1046
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:27,168
but sooner or later, the Browns, well...

1047
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:29,460
they'll forget you.

1048
01:01:29,543 --> 01:01:31,001
They always do.

1049
01:01:31,585 --> 01:01:33,460
They'll miss one visit.

1050
01:01:33,543 --> 01:01:34,918
Then two.

1051
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:37,251
Before you know it,

1052
01:01:38,085 --> 01:01:40,001
you won't have a home to go back to.

1053
01:01:41,168 --> 01:01:44,043
You're wrong, Knuckles.
You're all wrong.

1054
01:01:44,126 --> 01:01:46,210
The Browns aren't like that.

1055
01:01:46,293 --> 01:01:49,168
They'll come tomorrow
and they'll have good news.

1056
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:50,460
You'll see.

1057
01:01:56,335 --> 01:01:57,793
<i>Hello?</i>

1058
01:01:57,876 --> 01:01:59,751
It's Judy Brown
from <i>The Portobello Express.</i>

1059
01:01:59,835 --> 01:02:00,835
<i>Come in.</i>

1060
01:02:00,918 --> 01:02:02,960
So what's this for, darlings?

1061
01:02:03,043 --> 01:02:04,668
- School newspaper?
- Yes.

1062
01:02:04,751 --> 01:02:07,960
We thought the agent of <i>the</i> Phoenix
Buchanan would be really interesting.

1063
01:02:08,043 --> 01:02:09,335
And you'd be right.

1064
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:12,043
But I've got two minutes,
so we better make it snappy.

1065
01:02:12,126 --> 01:02:15,126
And I've only given you that
because you've brought breakfast.

1066
01:02:15,335 --> 01:02:17,418
Nice buns, by the way.

1067
01:02:19,668 --> 01:02:21,001
Here he comes.

1068
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:24,126
Hello, Joe. What a surprise!

1069
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:25,710
What are you doing here?

1070
01:02:25,793 --> 01:02:27,835
Posting letters. How's Paddington?

1071
01:02:27,918 --> 01:02:31,668
- Oh, he's a tough wee bear.
- Yeah, he is. Well, send him my best.

1072
01:02:31,751 --> 01:02:33,710
- I will. Thank you, Joe.
- Bye.

1073
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:34,793
Bye-bye.

1074
01:02:45,710 --> 01:02:47,168
Mr Buchanan.

1075
01:02:48,251 --> 01:02:51,001
So, when can we expect to see
Mr Buchanan back on stage?

1076
01:02:51,085 --> 01:02:53,668
Phoenix? Oh,
I wouldn't hold your breath, darling.

1077
01:02:53,835 --> 01:02:57,710
No, no, no, don't get me wrong.
He's a terrific actor.

1078
01:02:57,793 --> 01:03:00,918
- But there is a teensy little problem.
- Really?

1079
01:03:01,001 --> 01:03:06,251
He won't work with other people.
Thinks they "dilute his talent".

1080
01:03:06,376 --> 01:03:07,668
Miss Fanshaw.

1081
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:09,335
Oh, I must scoot.

1082
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:12,001
We're having lunch
with a big Broadway producer.

1083
01:03:12,085 --> 01:03:15,293
- Oh, where are you going?
- The Ritz, darling!

1084
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:18,168
Really nice buns.

1085
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:28,335
Well, good heavens!
Come. Come.

1086
01:03:29,918 --> 01:03:31,751
<i>The package
has been delivered.</i>

1087
01:03:31,835 --> 01:03:34,835
Repeat. The package has been delivered.

1088
01:03:35,293 --> 01:03:37,251
Barkridge's, no less.

1089
01:03:37,335 --> 01:03:40,168
Lucky, lucky Phoenix. Whoo!

1090
01:03:45,751 --> 01:03:47,918
- Hello?
<i>- Phoenix.</i>

1091
01:03:48,001 --> 01:03:50,251
Felicity! What a lovely surprise.

1092
01:03:50,335 --> 01:03:52,501
I was beginning to think
you'd lost my number.

1093
01:03:52,585 --> 01:03:54,126
<i>I've got two minutes,</i>

1094
01:03:54,251 --> 01:03:56,168
<i>so we better make it snappy.</i>

1095
01:03:56,251 --> 01:03:57,293
OK...

1096
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:58,876
<i>We're having lunch</i>

1097
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,001
<i>with a big Broadway producer.</i>

1098
01:04:01,085 --> 01:04:05,043
Well, wonderful news. Yes, yes!
Where does one go?

1099
01:04:05,251 --> 01:04:07,210
<i>The Ritz, darling!</i>

1100
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,210
I am on my way.

1101
01:04:09,335 --> 01:04:11,001
<i>Nice buns, by the way.</i>

1102
01:04:12,835 --> 01:04:13,835
I beg your pardon?

1103
01:04:16,626 --> 01:04:18,168
<i>Really nice buns.</i>

1104
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,001
Thank you, darling.

1105
01:04:21,793 --> 01:04:25,751
I've never had any complaints
about Mr and Mrs Botty-cheek.

1106
01:04:25,918 --> 01:04:27,585
Yes!

1107
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:30,001
Gloves. Keys.

1108
01:04:30,126 --> 01:04:32,918
And exit.

1109
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:45,751
Mary?

1110
01:04:46,835 --> 01:04:49,960
Where all your dreams come true?

1111
01:04:59,001 --> 01:05:00,501
Open the window.

1112
01:05:05,085 --> 01:05:07,418
- Hello, darling.
- Have you gone insane?

1113
01:05:07,501 --> 01:05:09,668
I know it's Phoenix
and I'm going to prove it.

1114
01:05:09,751 --> 01:05:11,210
This is breaking and entering!

1115
01:05:11,293 --> 01:05:13,626
We haven't broken anything.

1116
01:05:15,501 --> 01:05:18,710
Why would Phoenix want to steal
a pop-up book? He's a millionaire!

1117
01:05:18,793 --> 01:05:21,501
That's where you're wrong.
He owes money all over town. Look.

1118
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:23,876
So he's got a few bills.
I mean, everyone...

1119
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:26,043
Good grief,
the man spends a lot on face cream.

1120
01:05:26,126 --> 01:05:28,376
He hasn't got a penny to his name.
Now come on.

1121
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,835
Let's find that book
and get out of here.

1122
01:05:36,043 --> 01:05:37,585
Cravat.

1123
01:05:42,626 --> 01:05:44,001
- Well?
- Nothing.

1124
01:05:44,085 --> 01:05:45,626
We must be missing something.

1125
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:48,460
Unless there's nothing to find.
Now can we please go?

1126
01:05:49,001 --> 01:05:51,168
- Look, Henry.
- What?

1127
01:05:51,293 --> 01:05:52,335
The carpet.

1128
01:05:52,418 --> 01:05:54,376
Yes, it's lovely.
I'll order a swatch.

1129
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:55,960
- Give me a leg-up.
- Oh...

1130
01:05:56,043 --> 01:05:58,335
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

1131
01:06:01,293 --> 01:06:03,376
Yes!

1132
01:06:07,335 --> 01:06:09,376
A secret room.

1133
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:11,918
- It's an attic.
- A secret attic.

1134
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:13,751
It's an ordinary attic.

1135
01:06:13,876 --> 01:06:16,335
Every house in the street has one.
I mean, look,

1136
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:19,876
it's just a perfectly normal...
Oh, my God, he's a weirdo.

1137
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:23,876
Look, Henry.
The nun. The thief. The king.

1138
01:06:24,793 --> 01:06:25,876
We were right!

1139
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:28,501
Sorry. We?

1140
01:06:28,585 --> 01:06:30,751
Well, well, I mean, I, I never...

1141
01:06:32,168 --> 01:06:34,085
- Quick!
- Get down, get down.

1142
01:06:44,376 --> 01:06:46,793
Quite frankly, ravishing!

1143
01:06:47,793 --> 01:06:49,960
Hello?

1144
01:06:53,001 --> 01:06:54,001
Who goes there?

1145
01:06:55,585 --> 01:06:57,376
Reveal yourself.

1146
01:07:03,376 --> 01:07:04,418
Henry?

1147
01:07:07,293 --> 01:07:08,293
Hello, Phoenix.

1148
01:07:09,585 --> 01:07:11,501
What on earth are you doing here?

1149
01:07:12,418 --> 01:07:14,710
I might ask you the same thing.

1150
01:07:14,835 --> 01:07:17,960
Well, I live here. It's my house.

1151
01:07:18,835 --> 01:07:21,918
And I... insure it.

1152
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:26,376
And for our Platinum Club members,
we perform

1153
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:30,668
an annual free home inspection
to verify your security arrangements.

1154
01:07:30,793 --> 01:07:32,710
In your pyjamas?

1155
01:07:33,668 --> 01:07:34,668
Hm-hmm.

1156
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:36,126
With your wife?

1157
01:07:36,251 --> 01:07:38,876
So that all seems pretty secure.

1158
01:07:39,543 --> 01:07:41,710
- Oh, hello, Phoenix.
- Mary.

1159
01:07:41,793 --> 01:07:45,001
- Didn't hear you come in.
- She helps out when we're busy.

1160
01:07:45,168 --> 01:07:47,126
Oh, well, that sounds entirely...

1161
01:07:48,043 --> 01:07:50,168
- plausible.
- Does it? Great!

1162
01:07:50,251 --> 01:07:53,168
Well, I'm delighted to say
that everything seems tickety-boo.

1163
01:07:53,293 --> 01:07:54,626
Wonderful.

1164
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:58,460
So, I'll nip back to the office
and get the boys to type that up ASAP.

1165
01:07:58,543 --> 01:08:00,668
- And we'll hope to see you soon.
- Indeed.

1166
01:08:00,751 --> 01:08:03,918
Perhaps next time <i>not</i> in your pyjamas.

1167
01:08:06,168 --> 01:08:08,918
- He's such a silly one.
- Ciao, now.

1168
01:08:12,376 --> 01:08:14,876
Oh, thank Larry it's there.

1169
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,668
Thank Larry, Johnny
and all the ghosts of the avenue.

1170
01:08:18,793 --> 01:08:21,251
Yeah, well, that was close,
weren't it? Eh?

1171
01:08:21,376 --> 01:08:24,335
- Too close, if you ask me.
- Hold your nerve, Macbeth.

1172
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:27,668
Screw your courage to the
sticking place. We are so nearly there.

1173
01:08:27,751 --> 01:08:30,626
I have followed this lady
through the whole of London

1174
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:34,710
and collected every one
of her clever little clues.

1175
01:08:34,793 --> 01:08:36,960
Aye. But what do they mean?

1176
01:08:37,043 --> 01:08:39,501
It's just a jumble of letters, ain't it?

1177
01:08:39,585 --> 01:08:43,001
<i>Au contraire, mon ami.</i>
Uh-uh. They are not letters at all.

1178
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:47,126
- They are... musical notes.
- Indeed, Poirot.

1179
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:52,335
And I believe I know
just where to play them.

1180
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:57,210
Hold it!

1181
01:08:57,293 --> 01:09:00,043
That is an amazing story.

1182
01:09:00,126 --> 01:09:02,501
But all you can actually prove

1183
01:09:02,585 --> 01:09:05,168
is that Phoenix Buchanan
keeps his old costumes.

1184
01:09:05,251 --> 01:09:07,918
Bring me some hard evidence.

1185
01:09:08,001 --> 01:09:10,918
Bring me the book with his fingerprints
on and then you've got a case.

1186
01:09:11,001 --> 01:09:13,210
But until then,
there's nothing I can do.

1187
01:09:13,293 --> 01:09:14,335
- I'm sorry.
- What?

1188
01:09:14,418 --> 01:09:17,376
Where she's... where's she going?

1189
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:20,918
- What do we do now?
- I don't know.

1190
01:09:21,001 --> 01:09:24,501
Well, at least we can tell Paddington
we know who did it.

1191
01:09:24,585 --> 01:09:26,793
- Oh, no.
- What?

1192
01:09:26,876 --> 01:09:29,210
- Oh, we've missed visiting.
- Oh.

1193
01:09:29,335 --> 01:09:31,001
Paddington...

1194
01:10:58,043 --> 01:10:59,543
Paddington!

1195
01:10:59,626 --> 01:11:01,460
Aunt Lucy.

1196
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:12,460
- Aunt Lucy!
- Paddington.

1197
01:11:15,293 --> 01:11:17,501
What are you doing here?

1198
01:11:17,585 --> 01:11:20,001
I thought you'd be at home.

1199
01:11:20,751 --> 01:11:23,210
I'm afraid I don't have one any more.

1200
01:11:23,585 --> 01:11:26,626
You see, I'm in prison.

1201
01:11:28,126 --> 01:11:30,501
And even the Browns have forgotten me.

1202
01:11:36,668 --> 01:11:39,835
Paddington.

1203
01:11:43,751 --> 01:11:44,751
Knuckles?

1204
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:48,960
Tonight's the night.
We leave at midnight.

1205
01:11:49,043 --> 01:11:52,376
You wanna clear your name,
it's now or never.

1206
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:54,543
You in?

1207
01:11:54,626 --> 01:11:56,418
I'm in.

1208
01:11:57,751 --> 01:12:00,376
Right.
Time to call it a night.

1209
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:02,751
Not much going on here anyway.

1210
01:12:02,835 --> 01:12:05,668
They've been good as gold recently.

1211
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:15,001
Lights out.

1212
01:13:24,585 --> 01:13:25,876
Ooh!

1213
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:33,293
Ah!

1214
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,543
Ooh, sandwiches.

1215
01:13:46,168 --> 01:13:48,960
- Paddington!
- Coming.

1216
01:14:35,835 --> 01:14:37,710
Good luck, little bear.

1217
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:50,751
This is the life, lads.

1218
01:14:50,835 --> 01:14:52,793
Freedom!

1219
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:09,043
Bring her down, Spoon.

1220
01:15:28,001 --> 01:15:30,626
There she is, boys.
Our ticket out of here.

1221
01:15:31,585 --> 01:15:34,376
What do you mean?
Where are we going?

1222
01:15:36,835 --> 01:15:39,668
- Might as well tell him, Knucks.
- Tell me what?

1223
01:15:39,751 --> 01:15:45,460
- Aren't we going to clear my name?
- Sorry, kid. Change of plan.

1224
01:15:45,543 --> 01:15:46,793
What?

1225
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:49,710
- We're leaving the country.
- And you're coming with us.

1226
01:15:49,793 --> 01:15:53,126
But... you lied to me

1227
01:15:53,210 --> 01:15:58,126
Oh, hey, now, it wasn't like that.
We were doing you a favour.

1228
01:15:58,210 --> 01:16:00,251
If we told you the truth,

1229
01:16:00,335 --> 01:16:02,918
you'd never have come along,
and it's better this way.

1230
01:16:03,001 --> 01:16:08,585
We are gonna make marmalade together.

1231
01:16:08,668 --> 01:16:10,585
But I don't want to, Knuckles.

1232
01:16:10,668 --> 01:16:13,293
I want to clear my name and go home.

1233
01:16:13,376 --> 01:16:15,418
And you said you'd help.

1234
01:16:15,501 --> 01:16:17,085
You promised.

1235
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:22,876
Sorry, kid.

1236
01:16:24,418 --> 01:16:26,043
No can do.

1237
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,251
Paddington!

1238
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:31,918
Let him go.

1239
01:16:32,626 --> 01:16:35,376
If he wants to get himself arrested,

1240
01:16:36,043 --> 01:16:37,335
that's his choice.

1241
01:17:19,376 --> 01:17:21,001
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hello, Jonathan.

1242
01:17:21,085 --> 01:17:22,918
<i>You've reached the Brown residence.</i>

1243
01:17:23,001 --> 01:17:25,585
<i>- We're not here now.
- But leave a message.</i>

1244
01:17:25,668 --> 01:17:30,210
Hello, it's me... Paddington.

1245
01:17:30,918 --> 01:17:33,043
<i>I hope you don't mind my calling.</i>

1246
01:17:33,126 --> 01:17:38,918
<i>I just wanted to let you know
I've broken out of prison, and, well...</i>

1247
01:17:39,001 --> 01:17:41,210
<i>I suppose I'm on the run.</i>

1248
01:17:41,293 --> 01:17:43,501
<i>I didn't really mean to but...</i>

1249
01:17:43,585 --> 01:17:46,710
<i>Knuckles said that if we broke out,
he'd help clear my name</i>

1250
01:17:48,001 --> 01:17:50,001
<i>and then I could come home.</i>

1251
01:17:50,918 --> 01:17:54,251
But he's gone now and I'm on my own.

1252
01:17:55,751 --> 01:17:58,585
I don't really know why I'm calling.

1253
01:17:58,668 --> 01:18:01,668
I suppose I just wanted to say...

1254
01:18:03,626 --> 01:18:04,751
...goodbye.

1255
01:18:31,585 --> 01:18:34,043
- Oh! Hello?
<i>- Paddington?</i>

1256
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:36,418
Yes. Yes, it's Paddington!

1257
01:18:36,501 --> 01:18:39,876
<i>I'm so sorry I escaped, Mrs Brown,
but I thought you'd forgotten me.</i>

1258
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,251
Oh, we'd never forget you, Paddington.

1259
01:18:42,335 --> 01:18:44,085
- Paddington?
- You're family!

1260
01:18:44,168 --> 01:18:45,668
We know who the thief was.

1261
01:18:45,751 --> 01:18:47,626
- It's Phoenix Buchanan.
- Mr Buchanan?

1262
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:49,585
<i>But he's disappeared into thin air.</i>

1263
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:52,043
We've been looking for him
at every landmark in that book.

1264
01:18:52,168 --> 01:18:53,960
<i>Every last page.</i>

1265
01:18:54,043 --> 01:18:55,960
"Where all your dreams come true."

1266
01:18:57,001 --> 01:18:58,168
Why do you say that?

1267
01:18:58,251 --> 01:19:00,626
Oh, it was written on the last page
of the pop-up book.

1268
01:19:00,710 --> 01:19:04,126
<i>- Always made me think of Aunt Lucy.</i>
- That's very bizarre.

1269
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:05,210
<i>Is it?</i>

1270
01:19:05,293 --> 01:19:09,335
I found that exact same phrase on
a scrap of paper in Phoenix's house.

1271
01:19:09,418 --> 01:19:12,293
- <i>Really?</i>
- I'm sure I've seen that before.

1272
01:19:12,418 --> 01:19:13,835
Look.

1273
01:19:13,918 --> 01:19:16,543
- "Where all your dreams come true."
- The organ?

1274
01:19:16,668 --> 01:19:18,835
That must be where
Madame Kozlova hid her fortune.

1275
01:19:18,918 --> 01:19:21,543
- Let's get to the fair.
- It's too late. They're leaving today.

1276
01:19:21,626 --> 01:19:24,543
- From Paddington Station.
- At 6:35.

1277
01:19:25,001 --> 01:19:27,543
- There's still time.
- Paddington, head for the station.

1278
01:19:27,626 --> 01:19:29,668
<i>If we can find Phoenix
and get hold of that book,</i>

1279
01:19:29,793 --> 01:19:31,501
<i>his fingerprints will prove everything.</i>

1280
01:19:31,585 --> 01:19:34,835
But that's miles away, Mr Brown. I...

1281
01:19:37,751 --> 01:19:38,918
I'll see you there.

1282
01:19:39,001 --> 01:19:40,918
Clear the road!

1283
01:19:41,001 --> 01:19:43,460
This is a refuse emergency!

1284
01:19:43,543 --> 01:19:44,876
Sorry!

1285
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:48,960
<i>Fellow citizens,
I've just received intelligence.</i>

1286
01:19:49,043 --> 01:19:52,626
<i>The bear has escaped
and may be heading this way.</i>

1287
01:19:52,751 --> 01:19:56,918
<i>I have raised the neighbourhood
panic level to "wild hysteria".</i>

1288
01:19:57,001 --> 01:19:58,668
Get out of the way, Mr Curry!

1289
01:19:58,751 --> 01:20:00,835
Paddington's not coming this way!

1290
01:20:00,918 --> 01:20:02,293
He's gonna clear his name.

1291
01:20:02,376 --> 01:20:05,585
- And we're gonna bring him home!
<i>- We don't want him here.</i>

1292
01:20:05,668 --> 01:20:08,376
No, of course you don't. You never have.

1293
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:12,418
As soon as you set eyes on that bear,
you made up your mind about him.

1294
01:20:12,501 --> 01:20:14,668
Well, Paddington's not like that.

1295
01:20:14,793 --> 01:20:18,585
He looks for the good in all of us
and somehow, he finds it.

1296
01:20:19,001 --> 01:20:21,668
It's why he makes friends
wherever he goes.

1297
01:20:21,751 --> 01:20:25,835
And it's why Windsor Gardens
is a happier place whenever he's around.

1298
01:20:25,918 --> 01:20:29,293
He wouldn't hesitate
if any of us needed help.

1299
01:20:29,376 --> 01:20:33,460
So stand aside, Mr Curry,
cos we're coming through!

1300
01:20:42,501 --> 01:20:44,085
<i>Nice try, Brown.</i>

1301
01:20:44,168 --> 01:20:46,335
<i>Your plan seems to have stalled.</i>

1302
01:20:46,418 --> 01:20:47,710
<i>Like your vehicle.</i>

1303
01:20:47,793 --> 01:20:51,168
<i>Try the choke. Go on, try the choke.
You're flooding it.</i>

1304
01:20:51,251 --> 01:20:53,918
- Clutch down, second gear, Mr Brown.
- What?

1305
01:20:54,001 --> 01:20:55,501
<i>- What you doing?</i>
- After three.

1306
01:20:55,585 --> 01:20:56,626
<i>- What's going on?</i>
- Three.

1307
01:20:56,710 --> 01:20:59,251
<i>You're illegally perambulating
on a public highway.</i>

1308
01:20:59,335 --> 01:21:01,001
Put your backs into it.

1309
01:21:01,085 --> 01:21:03,001
<i>Do not push that vehicle!</i>

1310
01:21:03,085 --> 01:21:04,585
Bring Paddington home.

1311
01:21:04,668 --> 01:21:07,085
- Thank you.
- Go, go, go! Oh!

1312
01:21:18,543 --> 01:21:22,460
Right, Paddington, stay low
and remember, you're a bin.

1313
01:21:26,918 --> 01:21:31,043
You're a bin. You're a bin.
Just an ordinary bin going for a walk.

1314
01:21:36,418 --> 01:21:38,876
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1315
01:21:39,751 --> 01:21:42,543
Nothing to see here,
Officer. Just a bin.

1316
01:21:42,626 --> 01:21:44,001
Hm.

1317
01:21:44,918 --> 01:21:46,168
Quite good being a bin.

1318
01:22:01,793 --> 01:22:02,876
Gentlemen.

1319
01:22:03,835 --> 01:22:06,001
Hmm.

1320
01:22:24,293 --> 01:22:25,710
Paddington!

1321
01:22:25,793 --> 01:22:27,126
Mr Brown!

1322
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:29,251
Quickly, he's on board!

1323
01:22:31,085 --> 01:22:33,418
Don't worry, I'll handle it myself!

1324
01:22:33,501 --> 01:22:35,710
We've gotta catch up with that train.

1325
01:22:35,793 --> 01:22:38,126
But how?

1326
01:22:40,668 --> 01:22:42,043
I've got an idea.

1327
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:45,876
Good morning, madam, sir.
Welcome on board.

1328
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:48,335
- Fine. Thank you.
- May I offer you a glass of champagne?

1329
01:22:48,418 --> 01:22:51,626
- Oh! Thank you. Very civilised, yes.
- Thank you so much. Very kind.

1330
01:22:51,710 --> 01:22:56,126
Nice to have a break after all I've been
through with that beastly bear.

1331
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:59,460
Boiler pressure, two-two-five.
Water, half a glass.

1332
01:22:59,543 --> 01:23:01,960
- Air brake, off.
- Nice work, J-Dog.

1333
01:23:03,085 --> 01:23:06,085
My name's not J-Dog.
It's Jonathan Brown.

1334
01:23:06,168 --> 01:23:08,001
And I like steam trains.

1335
01:23:08,085 --> 01:23:09,918
Oh! Oh, for goodness' sake.

1336
01:23:10,001 --> 01:23:11,668
- I'm so sorry.
- Get off!

1337
01:23:11,751 --> 01:23:13,418
- Ssh, ssh.
- Stop it, stop it!

1338
01:23:13,501 --> 01:23:14,918
Don't shush me, Gertrude.

1339
01:23:15,001 --> 01:23:17,543
I have just been spilled upon
by a chilled liquid.

1340
01:23:17,626 --> 01:23:21,210
Gerald. I want you to shush.

1341
01:23:23,418 --> 01:23:24,918
Yes, Gertrude.

1342
01:23:25,001 --> 01:23:28,043
<i>...news from the BBC.</i>

1343
01:23:28,126 --> 01:23:32,668
<i>Four convicts made a daring escape
from Portobello Prison last night.</i>

1344
01:23:32,751 --> 01:23:35,293
<i>The prisoners all appear to have
vanished without a trace...</i>

1345
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:39,626
<i>...except Paddington Brown,
who was seen boarding a fair train</i>

1346
01:23:39,710 --> 01:23:42,251
<i>bound for Bristol. Police are closing in</i>

1347
01:23:42,335 --> 01:23:44,335
<i>and expect to make an arrest soon.</i>

1348
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,085
Poor little fella.

1349
01:23:48,710 --> 01:23:51,168
Must be somewhere down there right now.

1350
01:23:51,251 --> 01:23:54,085
Shouldn't we help him, Knuckles?

1351
01:23:54,168 --> 01:23:57,168
How? We go back down there,
they won't just lock us up,

1352
01:23:57,251 --> 01:24:01,335
- they'll throw away the key!
- I know, but... he's our friend.

1353
01:24:02,126 --> 01:24:03,460
Stick to the plan.

1354
01:24:05,626 --> 01:24:08,043
I don't do nothin' for no one
for nothin'.

1355
01:24:31,043 --> 01:24:32,335
Well, Grandfather.

1356
01:24:33,376 --> 01:24:35,293
The moment of truth.

1357
01:24:39,251 --> 01:24:40,251
D.

1358
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:43,043
D.

1359
01:24:45,293 --> 01:24:47,960
A. A.

1360
01:24:48,710 --> 01:24:51,668
The book.

1361
01:24:53,876 --> 01:24:55,293
Ah!

1362
01:24:59,001 --> 01:25:01,710
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

1363
01:25:02,293 --> 01:25:04,710
- Paddington!
- He can't hear us.

1364
01:25:04,876 --> 01:25:08,168
- Can this thing go any faster?
- I can try but I need more coal.

1365
01:25:08,251 --> 01:25:11,001
- I'm on it.
- Pull alongside. I'm going across.

1366
01:25:11,085 --> 01:25:12,543
- I'll come with you.
- Judy!

1367
01:25:12,668 --> 01:25:14,793
Just you try and stop us!

1368
01:25:16,251 --> 01:25:17,251
Come on, then!

1369
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:54,668
- You ready?
- Yep.

1370
01:25:54,751 --> 01:25:56,710
Go!

1371
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:10,793
<i>Open your mind
and your legs will follow.</i>

1372
01:26:18,793 --> 01:26:20,793
- Mr Brown!
- Mrs Bird!

1373
01:26:23,126 --> 01:26:24,335
C.

1374
01:26:28,001 --> 01:26:30,335
And finally... E.

1375
01:26:33,585 --> 01:26:35,918
It works!

1376
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:51,751
Ooh.

1377
01:26:55,501 --> 01:26:57,251
Hello.

1378
01:26:57,376 --> 01:27:00,126
Aren't you pretty?

1379
01:27:00,501 --> 01:27:04,043
West End, here I come.

1380
01:27:06,501 --> 01:27:07,876
M-Morning.

1381
01:27:09,335 --> 01:27:11,960
No!

1382
01:27:12,043 --> 01:27:15,085
What was it? Er, D. F.

1383
01:27:15,293 --> 01:27:17,710
D.

1384
01:27:17,876 --> 01:27:20,293
Come back with that book!

1385
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:43,835
Where do you think you're going, bear?

1386
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:47,001
It's a train. It comes to an end,

1387
01:27:47,168 --> 01:27:48,543
like all of us, alas.

1388
01:27:48,626 --> 01:27:50,835
Oh.

1389
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,960
Whoops!

1390
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:58,001
Exit bear, pursued by an actor...

1391
01:28:00,251 --> 01:28:02,876
Phoenix Buchanan.

1392
01:28:03,626 --> 01:28:05,043
Mrs Bird?

1393
01:28:05,168 --> 01:28:07,293
Oh, so <i>now</i> you remember me?

1394
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:10,043
Well, I never.

1395
01:28:10,168 --> 01:28:11,543
The cavalry.

1396
01:28:11,626 --> 01:28:15,168
An old crone, a little girl
and an insurance man.

1397
01:28:15,251 --> 01:28:17,251
What am I going to do?

1398
01:28:17,376 --> 01:28:19,126
I'll tell you exactly
what I'm going to do.

1399
01:28:19,251 --> 01:28:20,293
Hm?

1400
01:28:20,418 --> 01:28:22,793
I'm going to bloomin' well
biff you on the nose.

1401
01:28:22,876 --> 01:28:24,793
Not a very good idea.

1402
01:28:26,126 --> 01:28:28,835
Stage combat, level four.

1403
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:32,335
Well, where I come from, laddie,

1404
01:28:32,418 --> 01:28:34,918
they teach you never
to bring a knife to a gunfight.

1405
01:28:36,293 --> 01:28:39,543
I think you'll find
that fires plastic darts.

1406
01:28:41,793 --> 01:28:42,918
So it does.

1407
01:28:43,793 --> 01:28:46,501
Whereas this sword looks very sharp.

1408
01:28:47,168 --> 01:28:49,793
Back you go. All of you, back.

1409
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:02,668
And for you, sir, the jumbo pavlova.

1410
01:29:02,751 --> 01:29:03,751
Enjoy.

1411
01:29:06,418 --> 01:29:10,376
Oh, hello, Your Honour.
The hair is looking lovely.

1412
01:29:15,126 --> 01:29:16,210
Paddington!

1413
01:29:16,335 --> 01:29:19,585
Mrs Brown! Um...

1414
01:29:19,668 --> 01:29:22,210
Ah. I've got an idea!

1415
01:29:22,876 --> 01:29:27,001
Good. Good. Excellent.
Now for your furry friend.

1416
01:29:37,626 --> 01:29:39,793
Slow down, Jonathan.

1417
01:29:45,626 --> 01:29:47,168
Coo-ee!

1418
01:29:47,293 --> 01:29:49,543
What a clever little plan.

1419
01:29:55,501 --> 01:29:58,460
Don't worry. I know a wee trick

1420
01:29:58,543 --> 01:30:00,960
Harry Houdini used to do.

1421
01:30:16,501 --> 01:30:18,918
Jump, Paddington! I'll catch you.

1422
01:30:20,043 --> 01:30:21,835
No!

1423
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:26,001
- Ah!
- No!

1424
01:30:34,543 --> 01:30:36,460
Bye-bye, bear.

1425
01:30:53,876 --> 01:30:54,960
Bull's-eye!

1426
01:31:15,501 --> 01:31:17,960
Stop the train, Jonathan!

1427
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:55,751
Let's go, lads.

1428
01:33:21,210 --> 01:33:22,835
Ah!

1429
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:31,585
Knuckles, you came back.

1430
01:33:31,668 --> 01:33:35,293
- Can't make marmalade on my own, can I?
- Thank you, everyone.

1431
01:33:35,376 --> 01:33:37,293
Paddington?

1432
01:33:37,376 --> 01:33:41,001
- He's burning up.
- Better get the little fella to bed.

1433
01:33:42,043 --> 01:33:43,793
- Mum!
- Paddington!

1434
01:33:43,876 --> 01:33:44,918
He's not well.

1435
01:33:45,001 --> 01:33:48,335
Don't worry, he's gonna
be fine. Aren't you, little buddy?

1436
01:34:12,668 --> 01:34:15,335
- Paddington!
- Where am I?

1437
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:17,001
Take it easy now.

1438
01:34:17,168 --> 01:34:21,335
You gave us a wee scare,
but you're home now.

1439
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:23,835
- Home?
- That's right. Look.

1440
01:34:23,918 --> 01:34:26,126
The police realised
they made a terrible mistake.

1441
01:34:26,251 --> 01:34:29,918
Phoenix Buchanan has been arrested,
and I might add,

1442
01:34:30,001 --> 01:34:32,460
is no longer a member
of our Platinum Club.

1443
01:34:32,543 --> 01:34:35,168
- Then...
- You're a free bear.

1444
01:34:35,335 --> 01:34:38,585
- How long have I been asleep?
- Three days.

1445
01:34:38,710 --> 01:34:41,126
Three days? But that means...

1446
01:34:41,293 --> 01:34:45,001
- It's Aunt Lucy's birthday.
- And I never sent her anything.

1447
01:34:45,126 --> 01:34:48,668
- It's all right, Paddington.
- But it isn't all right, Mrs Brown.

1448
01:34:48,793 --> 01:34:53,251
You see, Aunt Lucy did so much for me
when I was a cub.

1449
01:34:53,335 --> 01:34:56,001
Without her,
I'd never have come to London.

1450
01:34:56,085 --> 01:35:00,501
And, I suppose all I ever really wanted
was to make her proud.

1451
01:35:01,501 --> 01:35:04,460
But now she's going to wake up
on her birthday with no present

1452
01:35:04,543 --> 01:35:06,960
and think I've let her down completely.

1453
01:35:07,043 --> 01:35:11,543
Oh, you great goose!
She won't think that at all.

1454
01:35:11,668 --> 01:35:12,835
Won't she?

1455
01:35:13,710 --> 01:35:15,335
Come with us.

1456
01:35:17,751 --> 01:35:19,793
Here he is!

1457
01:35:27,376 --> 01:35:28,668
What are you all doing here?

1458
01:35:28,751 --> 01:35:31,251
- We wanted to say thank you.
- Thank you?

1459
01:35:31,335 --> 01:35:34,001
- For everything you've done for us.
- Yes.

1460
01:35:34,085 --> 01:35:35,960
If it wasn't for you,
we'd never have met.

1461
01:35:36,043 --> 01:35:37,793
You helped me pass my exam.

1462
01:35:37,876 --> 01:35:39,918
I would be permanently
locked out of my house.

1463
01:35:41,293 --> 01:35:44,376
I'd say you've rather a lot
to be proud of.

1464
01:35:44,501 --> 01:35:45,501
Oh.

1465
01:35:45,585 --> 01:35:48,668
When we heard the police
wanted the popping book for evidence,

1466
01:35:48,793 --> 01:35:52,293
we thought we'd find Aunt Lucy
another present.

1467
01:35:52,376 --> 01:35:54,001
So we all clubbed together.

1468
01:35:54,168 --> 01:35:56,960
I pulled in a few favours
from my old Air Force chums.

1469
01:35:57,043 --> 01:35:59,418
And we think she's going to love it.

1470
01:35:59,501 --> 01:36:01,418
But... what is it?

1471
01:36:02,418 --> 01:36:05,585
You wanted to get that book so
Aunt Lucy could see London, didn't you?

1472
01:36:05,668 --> 01:36:07,585
It was always her dream.

1473
01:36:07,668 --> 01:36:11,918
Well, we thought,
why look at London in a book

1474
01:36:12,001 --> 01:36:13,835
when she could see the real thing?

1475
01:36:17,376 --> 01:36:19,501
Why don't you go and answer that?

1476
01:36:36,335 --> 01:36:38,293
Oh.

1477
01:36:38,418 --> 01:36:40,876
Oh.

1478
01:36:41,001 --> 01:36:43,668
Paddington.

1479
01:36:44,835 --> 01:36:47,210
Happy birthday, Aunt Lucy.

You have proved yourself
