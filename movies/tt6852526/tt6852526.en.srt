3
00:00:57,381 --> 00:01:00,350
The nearest galaxy,
the Canis Dwarf...

4
00:01:00,484 --> 00:01:03,020
know how long
it'd take to get there?

5
00:01:03,154 --> 00:01:05,588
I literally
have no idea.

6
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:09,225
900 million years
with our current tech.

7
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,361
25 thousand if you could
travel at the speed of light.

8
00:01:12,796 --> 00:01:14,798
So, you're saying
it's possible?

9
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,600
Someday.

10
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:20,437
I mean,
if you could build a ship

11
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,972
that could travel
at the speed of light,

12
00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:24,974
you wouldn't experience
time at all.

13
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:26,876
You wouldn't age a day.

14
00:01:27,343 --> 00:01:29,411
But when you got back,
all your friends

15
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:31,014
and family would be gone.

16
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,317
Yeah. Probably
the whole of humanity.

17
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:36,420
What would be
the point, then?

18
00:01:38,588 --> 00:01:40,489
To find out what the point is!

19
00:01:56,572 --> 00:01:57,907
See you tomorrow?

20
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,608
See you tomorrow.

21
00:03:20,056 --> 00:03:22,191
- Boxer.
- <i>Boxer, it's Riggs.</i>

22
00:03:22,725 --> 00:03:24,594
<i>Sorry to be calling so early,
but a heart</i>

23
00:03:24,728 --> 00:03:27,397
<i>became available for
your patient, Serena Vazquez.</i>

24
00:03:27,531 --> 00:03:30,067
<i>The donor's an 18-year-old
male from Buffalo.</i>

25
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:33,137
Good news. What's the ETA
on the heart from Buffalo?

26
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,906
<i>9:25 a.m.
I'm on my way.</i>

27
00:03:36,038 --> 00:03:38,341
<i>ECHO and catch reports
are uploading.</i>

28
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:40,176
Thank you.

29
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:42,979
What time is it?

30
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:45,316
Ten 'til.

31
00:04:34,963 --> 00:04:37,401
Oh, shit.

32
00:04:38,935 --> 00:04:40,870
Shit.

33
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,382
No yolk. Trust me.

34
00:04:52,915 --> 00:04:54,584
Thank you.

35
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,461
They found Serena Vazquez
a heart?

36
00:05:06,362 --> 00:05:09,466
I'm happy for her. She has,
what, like seven grand kids?

37
00:05:09,598 --> 00:05:10,866
Five.

38
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,668
And I personally
think she's too old.

39
00:05:12,802 --> 00:05:15,504
But there are others on the
committee who felt differently.

40
00:05:20,877 --> 00:05:23,079
While you silently judge me...

41
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:25,714
which is beginning
to feel like a theme...

42
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:30,220
please consider there may be
other, more deserving patients.

43
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:36,692
I'll see you at the hospital.

44
00:05:37,627 --> 00:05:40,063
Don't be ridiculous.
I'll drive you.

45
00:05:51,774 --> 00:05:53,509
<i>Big storm brewing for this</i>

46
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,913
<i>upcoming weekend
here in Manhattan but it seems</i>

47
00:05:56,045 --> 00:05:58,548
<i>like the worst weather
is over the weekend, so...</i>

48
00:06:01,617 --> 00:06:03,420
<i>...gorgeous
day here in New York City</i>

49
00:06:03,552 --> 00:06:05,622
<i>as we get up to
around 48 degrees,</i>

50
00:06:05,754 --> 00:06:08,257
<i>and the low 50s
for the rest of the week...</i>

51
00:06:10,627 --> 00:06:12,961
- Dinner after the shift?
- Really?

52
00:06:13,096 --> 00:06:14,997
You're still not
taking me to the door?

53
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,332
Jordan, please. It's...

54
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:18,634
Unprofessional. I know,
I get it.

55
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:24,940
Boxer, the only one that
I'm silently judging

56
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:27,644
in this, whatever this is...

57
00:06:28,577 --> 00:06:30,146
is myself.

58
00:06:57,074 --> 00:06:58,208
Hey, clear the entrance.

59
00:06:58,341 --> 00:06:59,575
What's going on here?

60
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:01,411
These two patients
are together.

61
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:03,480
- They were airlifted in...
- She's not the one

62
00:07:03,612 --> 00:07:05,314
in critical condition!
You treat the boy first.

63
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,053
Dr. Taylor, can you
help me check him in?

64
00:07:11,187 --> 00:07:13,156
Please, check him in properly.

65
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,057
Trip Granger,
he has a heart condition.

66
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,659
He's a patient of Dr. Boxer.

67
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:19,463
- Are you the mother?
- No, she's my attorney.

68
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:21,131
He's my son.

69
00:07:51,894 --> 00:07:54,631
So what's
the verdict, Taylor?

70
00:07:54,764 --> 00:07:56,766
Should they be diggin'
that hole for me or what?

71
00:07:56,899 --> 00:07:59,870
The verdict is,
there's no verdict.

72
00:08:00,002 --> 00:08:02,038
I still have to do
a full blood work-up.

73
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,776
You're sweet, but...
you don't need blood work

74
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,213
to tell ya what you
can see with your own eyes.

75
00:08:10,346 --> 00:08:11,480
What's that, Walter?

76
00:08:11,613 --> 00:08:13,649
I'm a fat ass with a bad heart.

77
00:08:15,017 --> 00:08:17,052
No one is digging any holes.

78
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:20,356
You're up for reclassification
today. Let's stay positive.

79
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:22,759
Make me a deal, Taylor.

80
00:08:22,891 --> 00:08:25,661
I want to watch "The Bachelor"
with my daughters,

81
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:27,864
and eat my wife's
shitty meatloaf.

82
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:32,968
- I think we can arrange that.
- No. At home.

83
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:37,908
If I get rejected again,
just let me go home.

84
00:08:42,345 --> 00:08:43,846
When he calls, please,

85
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,149
do not answer the phone.
We need everything on paper.

86
00:08:46,283 --> 00:08:48,185
I heard you
the first time...

87
00:08:48,317 --> 00:08:49,985
Yeah,
but I apparently...

88
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:52,189
You wanted to see me?

89
00:08:52,822 --> 00:08:55,091
I'm sorry,
am I interrupting?

90
00:08:55,225 --> 00:08:56,591
Have a seat, Dr. Taylor.

91
00:08:56,725 --> 00:08:59,195
I'd like you
to meet Father Dunbar.

92
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:00,829
He's consulting for the board.

93
00:09:00,964 --> 00:09:02,799
Charlie. Charlie Dunbar.

94
00:09:02,932 --> 00:09:04,900
Are you, um,
a spiritual consultant?

95
00:09:05,034 --> 00:09:08,004
Legal, actually. I've only
been ordained for three years.

96
00:09:08,138 --> 00:09:10,273
Before that, I was
a defense attorney for 15.

97
00:09:10,407 --> 00:09:11,740
Quite the skill set.

98
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,009
Tell that to my ex-wife.

99
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:17,846
I understand
you've been interviewing

100
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,415
for the Heart Committee.

101
00:09:19,548 --> 00:09:21,150
Word on the street
is you're quite

102
00:09:21,283 --> 00:09:22,784
the up-and-comer
in cardiac surgery.

103
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:24,254
She's fantastic.

104
00:09:24,388 --> 00:09:25,855
I see you started
your residency in...

105
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:28,759
- plastic surgery?
- Her mother's Nadia Taylor.

106
00:09:29,158 --> 00:09:30,759
She's a cosmetic.

107
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:33,328
If you were a middle-aged
woman from the Upper East Side,

108
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:34,798
you would know her.

109
00:09:36,332 --> 00:09:38,000
Why didn't you
follow in her footsteps?

110
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:42,038
I watched a friend from college
die waiting for a heart.

111
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:43,572
Ah.

112
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:47,443
The Lenox Hill committee denied
her a status upgrade twice.

113
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:50,546
I'm sure
they had their reasons.

114
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,013
And that didn't make
you ambivalent

115
00:09:52,148 --> 00:09:53,682
about these committees?

116
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,786
Honestly? I am
a little ambivalent.

117
00:09:57,921 --> 00:09:59,623
Ideally, no one
should have the right

118
00:09:59,755 --> 00:10:01,356
to decide who gets priority.

119
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,225
But I'm optimistic
that one day,

120
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,894
we won't have
an organ shortage.

121
00:10:05,028 --> 00:10:07,497
I think we'll figure out
a way to fix this problem.

122
00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:11,100
Until then, this system,
it's the best we've got.

123
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:13,136
It's the only one we've got.

124
00:10:13,903 --> 00:10:15,837
What I'm trying to say is,
that I trust myself,

125
00:10:15,971 --> 00:10:19,509
which is why I want
to be a part of this process.

126
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:25,014
Well, you got the position,
Dr. Taylor.

127
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:28,550
Today's session
starts at 8:00,

128
00:10:28,684 --> 00:10:30,486
so you have an hour
to do your rounds.

129
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,889
Thank you, both.
You will not be disappointed.

130
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,349
Trip's stable
for the time being.

131
00:10:59,481 --> 00:11:01,418
That doesn't sound
very promising.

132
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:03,252
He's going to need
that transplant sooner

133
00:11:03,385 --> 00:11:04,721
than we anticipated.

134
00:11:04,854 --> 00:11:06,290
How soon?

135
00:11:07,523 --> 00:11:08,957
Move him up the list.

136
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:10,725
You know that's not
how it works.

137
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,629
This morning,
the committee

138
00:11:12,761 --> 00:11:15,364
- will discuss upgrading his...
- MOVE HIM UP THE LIST!

139
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,502
I apologize.

140
00:11:20,635 --> 00:11:23,639
If he's been using again,
there is nothing I can do.

141
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:27,811
Look after my boy, Andre.

142
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,398
Jesus Christ.

143
00:13:30,732 --> 00:13:36,272
Technically, you'd refer to him
as TS-16, or "Test Subject 16."

144
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,674
But folks around
the lab have given him

145
00:13:38,807 --> 00:13:41,110
a nickname: Columbus

146
00:13:42,979 --> 00:13:45,014
Columbus is the first animal
to carry a humanized organ

147
00:13:45,148 --> 00:13:48,652
we believe can be safely
used for transplantation.

148
00:13:49,251 --> 00:13:50,786
In his case, it's a kidney.

149
00:13:50,921 --> 00:13:52,321
As you know,
Xenotransplantation

150
00:13:52,455 --> 00:13:54,490
is hardly a novel concept.

151
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:56,192
Doctors and scientists
have been trying

152
00:13:56,325 --> 00:13:59,963
to exchange organs and
tissue cross-species for years.

153
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:04,166
Up until now, it hasn't worked.

154
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:07,802
What is unique about X-Origins
is that we've created

155
00:14:07,937 --> 00:14:11,240
a patented gene-editing tool
that helps to produce organs

156
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:13,976
that the host immune system
won't reject.

157
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,111
In other words,
we harnessed this technology

158
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:20,516
on pigs so that it can
become a reality for humans.

159
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:22,818
In the prospectus,
it says human testing

160
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:25,754
is 24 months away.
Why so far out?

161
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:28,991
The FDA requires
two years of nonhuman trials.

162
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,894
There is a pig exactly
like this one

163
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:36,132
who is carrying a kidney that
was engineered for a monkey.

164
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,802
That's where we start.

165
00:14:38,934 --> 00:14:41,002
So when
would we start recouping?

166
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:45,908
I won't lie to you. Uh,
it's gonna take quite a while.

167
00:14:49,711 --> 00:14:52,148
Allow me to say this,
if I can...

168
00:14:53,381 --> 00:14:57,753
If we are successful,
this tech will eradicate

169
00:14:57,886 --> 00:15:01,257
the tremendous need for
healthy human organs worldwide.

170
00:15:02,558 --> 00:15:05,094
We will
revolutionize transplantation.

171
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,002
And if you don't give a shit

172
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:15,103
about changing the world,
that's okay.

173
00:15:15,236 --> 00:15:17,706
You can still enjoy
the obscene amount of money

174
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,108
I'm gonna make you.

175
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,012
<i>Hey, it's Riggs.</i>

176
00:16:30,145 --> 00:16:31,880
<i>I'm leaving Buffalo
with the heart.</i>

177
00:16:32,014 --> 00:16:34,082
<i>Should be touching down
on schedule.</i>

178
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:47,962
Mrs. Vazquez.

179
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:51,433
UNOS has found a match for you,
from a donor upstate.

180
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:54,236
My colleague is on his way
to retrieve the organ.

181
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,237
I will be performing
the transplant.

182
00:16:56,371 --> 00:17:00,043
My associate, Dr. Pope, will be
prepping you in 20 minutes.

183
00:17:01,443 --> 00:17:03,979
Do you have any questions?

184
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:07,582
Am I dreaming?

185
00:17:07,717 --> 00:17:09,686
No,
you're not dreaming.

186
00:17:11,886 --> 00:17:14,624
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Boxer.

187
00:17:19,194 --> 00:17:20,929
Trip Granger will be dead
in a week

188
00:17:21,063 --> 00:17:22,431
if he doesn't get a transplant.

189
00:17:22,565 --> 00:17:24,299
It's on the docket.

190
00:17:24,432 --> 00:17:26,067
Let's hope he's laid off
the marching powder.

191
00:17:26,201 --> 00:17:27,970
Well, his blood won't lie.

192
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:29,939
Though I'm sure the elder
Granger wishes it could.

193
00:17:30,071 --> 00:17:31,706
What did he say
when you saw him?

194
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,175
Nothing he hasn't already.

195
00:17:33,308 --> 00:17:35,278
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

196
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:38,014
- Why, Val, what's up?
- Nothing.

197
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:43,653
I hear the board's
up in arms about

198
00:17:43,786 --> 00:17:45,254
the rating downgrade.

199
00:17:45,386 --> 00:17:47,222
Brought in a consultant
to audit the program.

200
00:17:47,355 --> 00:17:48,825
With the budget cuts,
we are officially

201
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,359
on the cutting board.

202
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:52,295
Jesus, that'd be
incredibly short-sighted.

203
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:54,396
They wouldn't even let me
hand-pick your replacement.

204
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:56,398
Who'd they go with?

205
00:18:02,505 --> 00:18:04,841
Good morning, Dr. Boxer.

206
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:09,712
- You're in my seat.
- Excuse me?

207
00:18:11,247 --> 00:18:14,984
I'm kidding. Welcome
to the committee, Dr. Taylor.

208
00:18:15,116 --> 00:18:17,653
Always
the charmer, Boxer!

209
00:18:18,186 --> 00:18:20,789
I'm Allen Lau,
the shrink on this ship.

210
00:18:20,923 --> 00:18:22,491
Jordan Taylor.
Great to meet you.

211
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:26,361
So, as you have no doubt
noticed, we have a new face.

212
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:28,730
Dr. Taylor is gonna be
taking over for Boxer

213
00:18:28,865 --> 00:18:31,534
when he leaves us to join
the private sector next month.

214
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:34,336
Until that time, we're gonna
roll with a six-man committee.

215
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,071
Guys, it is an honor.

216
00:18:36,806 --> 00:18:39,542
I'd like to jump right in,
'cause I've got some good news.

217
00:18:39,674 --> 00:18:42,677
One of our own, Serena Vazquez,
is getting a heart.

218
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:47,216
The donor is an 18-year-old
boy from Buffalo.

219
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:49,751
Dr. Riggs is bringing
the organ home as we speak.

220
00:18:49,885 --> 00:18:52,221
Boxer's operating,
incision time is 9 a.m.

221
00:18:53,189 --> 00:18:54,758
I'll be scrubbing up
in 30 minutes.

222
00:18:54,891 --> 00:18:56,526
May we make this short
and sweet, please?

223
00:18:56,659 --> 00:18:59,195
Our first patient
is up for reclassification.

224
00:18:59,327 --> 00:19:02,365
Walter Curtis, who has DCM.

225
00:19:02,498 --> 00:19:06,970
He is currently Status 1-B, but
his condition has deteriorated.

226
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:09,706
Positives: He's 48,
he's employed.

227
00:19:09,838 --> 00:19:11,406
He has a strong support system.

228
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:15,677
I'm married. And I've got
three beautiful daughters

229
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:18,980
And negatives: he's 5'9,
335 pounds.

230
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:22,451
Bipolar, but I did
pass my last psych eval.

231
00:19:22,585 --> 00:19:26,488
Primary insurance, but... I
don't have a secondary policy.

232
00:19:27,256 --> 00:19:29,391
I'd like to point out
that Walter

233
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:32,128
has lost eight pounds
since he's been here.

234
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:34,697
How long has he been here?

235
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,399
- It's still progress.
- Three months.

236
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:39,168
Three months
of controlled diet,

237
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:41,436
he's lost
a measly eight pounds.

238
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,240
Richard Simmons wouldn't blush.
We wouldn't be

239
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:46,543
giving him a heart,
we'd be giving him a time bomb.

240
00:19:46,675 --> 00:19:48,376
Well, don't
sugarcoat it, Boxer.

241
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:50,346
- Statistics don't lie.
- But they never tell

242
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,414
the whole story either,
which is why we're here.

243
00:19:52,548 --> 00:19:55,484
Let's hear from Dr. Taylor,
Walter's her patient...

244
00:19:59,855 --> 00:20:01,423
I think that Walter's trying.

245
00:20:01,557 --> 00:20:03,492
Actually, I know
that he's trying.

246
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:06,295
He's not blessed
with a good metabolism,

247
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:08,531
but should that preclude him
from getting a heart?

248
00:20:08,663 --> 00:20:10,165
I don't think so.

249
00:20:10,298 --> 00:20:11,666
He's putting three daughters
through college

250
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:13,201
on a doorman's salary.

251
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:14,803
And for that
he deserves a heart?

252
00:20:14,936 --> 00:20:16,371
And a Nobel Prize!

253
00:20:16,505 --> 00:20:18,608
Look, he's reliable,
he takes his medication.

254
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,675
He's a cheerleader
for the entire ward...

255
00:20:20,808 --> 00:20:22,644
And he plays guitar,
and he makes finger puppets

256
00:20:22,778 --> 00:20:25,114
for pediatrics. This is not
a congeniality contest.

257
00:20:25,248 --> 00:20:28,484
If you would let us finish,
Dr. Boxer, what we're trying

258
00:20:28,616 --> 00:20:31,686
to say... is that Walter
has the right disposition.

259
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:33,321
He can handle it.

260
00:20:33,455 --> 00:20:35,424
Walter's medical bills
are half a million, easy.

261
00:20:35,557 --> 00:20:38,160
It's difficult to justify
adding another 200K

262
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:39,961
to such a high-risk patient.

263
00:20:40,096 --> 00:20:44,500
With all due respect...
how can you quantify it?

264
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:46,501
We could add years
to Walter's life.

265
00:20:46,635 --> 00:20:49,070
- You don't know.
- No, I don't know.

266
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:50,439
But I have to quantify it.

267
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:52,809
I'm responsible
for this program.

268
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:54,809
We've had some issues recently.

269
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:57,078
US News downgraded our rating.

270
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:59,781
Nine heart rejections
within the last year.

271
00:20:59,915 --> 00:21:01,215
It's just dumb,
bad luck...

272
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:03,084
Or poor
decision-making.

273
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:05,654
Based on criteria more
sentimental than scientific.

274
00:21:05,788 --> 00:21:08,091
We all have a voice,
we all come at this

275
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,091
from different angles.
It's why the process works.

276
00:21:10,224 --> 00:21:13,862
I would like to propose
moving Walter up to Status 1-A.

277
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:17,667
Dr. Riggs has already e-mailed
in his vote. He's in favor.

278
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:19,667
- Dr. Gilroy?
- Not in favor.

279
00:21:19,801 --> 00:21:22,236
- Dr. Boxer?
- No.

280
00:21:22,371 --> 00:21:24,540
- Dr. Lau?
- I'm abstaining.

281
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:26,108
I have a conflict.

282
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:29,278
Dr. Taylor?
You're the decider.

283
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:41,658
Yes. I vote yes.

284
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:46,962
Walter Curtis
is upped to Status 1-A.

285
00:21:53,702 --> 00:21:55,203
<i>It's Dr. Pope.</i>

286
00:21:55,336 --> 00:21:56,939
<i>There's been
a complication in the OR.</i>

287
00:21:57,073 --> 00:21:58,607
Serena Vazquez is dead.

288
00:22:01,109 --> 00:22:02,244
What?

289
00:22:02,377 --> 00:22:04,045
The fuck are you talking about?

290
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,581
She coded on the table.

291
00:22:05,713 --> 00:22:08,250
Resuscitation failed...
prep was going fine,

292
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,251
and her heart, it just stopped.

293
00:22:19,628 --> 00:22:21,163
Did you call Riggs?

294
00:22:21,297 --> 00:22:23,265
Yes. He's already in the air
with the donor heart.

295
00:22:23,397 --> 00:22:25,067
- UNOS?
- No time to redirect it.

296
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:26,602
So, what do you suggest we do?

297
00:22:26,734 --> 00:22:28,636
It goes to somebody
else in this hospital.

298
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,538
We can't waste a heart.

299
00:22:31,507 --> 00:22:32,941
It has to be beating
by 11:00 a.m.,

300
00:22:33,075 --> 00:22:34,477
which means we need to be

301
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:36,878
prepping someone else by 9:30,
the latest.

302
00:22:37,011 --> 00:22:38,714
That is our true expiration.

303
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,718
Who are the other matches?

304
00:22:42,984 --> 00:22:44,653
Walter Curtis is a match.

305
00:22:44,787 --> 00:22:46,922
I don't know about the rest,
I'd have to check.

306
00:22:47,055 --> 00:22:49,325
Then, check. We reconvene in
ten, sort through the matches,

307
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:51,527
- make a decision.
- Where are you going?

308
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,795
To tell Mr. Vazquez
his wife is dead.

309
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:36,304
Talk about gettin' thrown into
the fire on your first day.

310
00:23:37,506 --> 00:23:40,109
Is UNOS going to have
an issue if we make the call?

311
00:23:40,242 --> 00:23:41,710
Never happened before.

312
00:23:42,443 --> 00:23:45,146
We don't have time
for their bureaucratic red tape.

313
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,316
That heart'll expire.

314
00:23:51,987 --> 00:23:56,025
Boxer, one month.
You are out of here in a month.

315
00:23:56,924 --> 00:23:59,228
Until then, we need
to be able to work together.

316
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:00,797
Can we do that?

317
00:24:04,532 --> 00:24:06,769
In real life,
we're obviously finished.

318
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,377
I shouldn't have
let things escalate.

319
00:24:15,978 --> 00:24:17,580
I hurt you.

320
00:24:17,712 --> 00:24:19,182
I'm sorry.

321
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:27,889
You know what hurts?

322
00:24:28,022 --> 00:24:30,958
It's not the fact that
you're a self-absorbed asshole.

323
00:24:31,093 --> 00:24:33,229
I blame myself
for thinking that

324
00:24:33,362 --> 00:24:35,163
you could be any different.

325
00:24:36,131 --> 00:24:39,835
What hurts is that you
don't think I'm a good doctor.

326
00:24:39,968 --> 00:24:41,437
Never said that.

327
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:43,437
But you don't want me
on the committee.

328
00:24:43,571 --> 00:24:45,707
I just don't
think you're cut out for this.

329
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,308
And why is that?

330
00:24:47,976 --> 00:24:50,680
You don't realize
the heart is just a muscle.

331
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:04,992
How many
chances does this woman get?

332
00:25:05,126 --> 00:25:08,163
She's ballooned to 240 pounds.

333
00:25:08,297 --> 00:25:10,732
We've given her
a bed for five months.

334
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:15,371
Unfortunately, we need
to cut our losses. I vote no.

335
00:25:15,505 --> 00:25:17,673
I vote yes.
Move her up.

336
00:25:17,806 --> 00:25:19,875
Dr. Taylor?

337
00:25:22,845 --> 00:25:25,748
Dr. Taylor?
You're the decider.

338
00:25:35,924 --> 00:25:37,393
No.

339
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:42,831
Gail Berry, upgrade denied.

340
00:25:47,568 --> 00:25:49,271
Priority
should be geographic!

341
00:25:49,404 --> 00:25:51,206
One, Albany. Two, Trenton.
Three, White Plains.

342
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:53,607
Bullshit. Albany
is a kidney. In what universe

343
00:25:53,741 --> 00:25:55,711
do you cut out
a kidney before a heart?

344
00:25:55,844 --> 00:25:57,846
Heart's staying
in the hospital. No transport.

345
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,181
It seems logical to me.

346
00:26:00,682 --> 00:26:02,183
Everybody, please,
just calm down.

347
00:26:04,787 --> 00:26:06,689
Will you all
just shut the fuck up!

348
00:26:07,355 --> 00:26:09,925
Operational priorities do not
deviate based on geography.

349
00:26:10,058 --> 00:26:11,993
One, heart.
Two, liver. Three, kidneys...

350
00:26:12,126 --> 00:26:13,561
I think
we got it under control.

351
00:26:13,695 --> 00:26:15,730
I don't really give a fuck
what you think.

352
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,231
And you are?

353
00:26:17,365 --> 00:26:18,733
I'm Director of the
Transplant Program

354
00:26:18,866 --> 00:26:20,568
at this hospital.

355
00:26:21,002 --> 00:26:23,672
Dr. Taylor? Apologies.

356
00:26:23,805 --> 00:26:25,774
We weren't briefed
on local protocol.

357
00:26:25,907 --> 00:26:27,876
Oh, yes, you were, honey.
You just had your head

358
00:26:28,009 --> 00:26:30,144
stuck too far up
your ass to listen.

359
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:31,713
Babysit them.

360
00:26:33,214 --> 00:26:34,649
Carry on!

361
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,526
Jesus.

362
00:26:58,472 --> 00:27:00,308
I'm confused, Emmett.

363
00:27:01,076 --> 00:27:03,411
My attorney's just still
waiting on signatures.

364
00:27:03,545 --> 00:27:05,881
Is there
some issue with the docs?

365
00:27:06,315 --> 00:27:08,116
Paperwork was fine.

366
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,352
The others are welcome
to invest.

367
00:27:10,486 --> 00:27:12,387
You know they won't come in
unless you do.

368
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,455
Were we not
at the same meeting?

369
00:27:14,589 --> 00:27:16,290
You mean the one
where you promised us

370
00:27:16,424 --> 00:27:18,493
"obscene" sums of money?

371
00:27:18,627 --> 00:27:21,730
So? What the fuck
is happening?

372
00:27:22,364 --> 00:27:23,833
You haven't
disclosed everything.

373
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:27,269
You think
I'm lying about the tech?

374
00:27:28,068 --> 00:27:30,338
No. Not the tech.

375
00:27:31,507 --> 00:27:33,609
You're lying about your health.

376
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,147
Your heart is failing.

377
00:27:39,548 --> 00:27:40,848
You won't live to see
your project

378
00:27:40,982 --> 00:27:42,984
to the end
without a transplant.

379
00:27:45,054 --> 00:27:46,788
My files are confidential.

380
00:27:46,922 --> 00:27:50,757
It's ironic,
tragically so. I'm very sorry.

381
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:54,429
I can set a meeting
with my successor.

382
00:27:54,563 --> 00:27:56,265
I'm working with some
of the finest doctors

383
00:27:56,397 --> 00:27:58,366
and scientists in the world.

384
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,672
Andre, I invested in you.
Not your team.

385
00:28:04,138 --> 00:28:07,542
You know, this is the first
start-up that I've invested in,

386
00:28:07,675 --> 00:28:10,211
because I believe
in what you're doing!

387
00:28:11,046 --> 00:28:13,682
But you're asking
for very big money now.

388
00:28:14,683 --> 00:28:16,719
Let me ask
you something, Emmett:

389
00:28:18,252 --> 00:28:21,624
Do I strike you as the kind
of guy who takes risks?

390
00:28:26,094 --> 00:28:28,096
Okay.

391
00:28:30,265 --> 00:28:34,836
If you agree to a transplant,
I'll draw down.

392
00:28:36,371 --> 00:28:40,209
I can't just agree
to a transplant.

393
00:28:40,342 --> 00:28:42,011
You read the file.

394
00:28:43,511 --> 00:28:45,513
I'll find you a heart.

395
00:28:50,551 --> 00:28:52,654
That's all I can offer.

396
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,192
I can't.

397
00:29:17,011 --> 00:29:18,646
Okay...

398
00:29:19,013 --> 00:29:22,983
The incoming heart
is O positive, 310 grams.

399
00:29:23,117 --> 00:29:25,919
As I mentioned,
Walter Curtis is a match,

400
00:29:26,054 --> 00:29:29,224
and there are two other 1-A
matches in the hospital. I...

401
00:29:30,992 --> 00:29:32,426
Excuse me, we're in a meeting.

402
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,028
My apologies
for being late, Val.

403
00:29:34,162 --> 00:29:36,432
I was already on the train
when I got your message.

404
00:29:36,565 --> 00:29:38,634
Guys, this is
Father Dunbar.

405
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:41,001
He is a former attorney
representing the board.

406
00:29:41,368 --> 00:29:45,339
Father, this is Dr. Boxer,
Dr. Lau, Nurse Wilkes.

407
00:29:45,473 --> 00:29:47,942
And, of course,
you know Dr. Taylor.

408
00:29:48,076 --> 00:29:50,278
Why exactly is he here?

409
00:29:50,645 --> 00:29:53,514
Because Trip Granger
is a match for this heart.

410
00:29:53,648 --> 00:29:55,616
Boxer is correct.

411
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,685
Trip Granger?
I checked him in this morning.

412
00:29:57,819 --> 00:29:59,319
His father's Emmett Granger.

413
00:29:59,453 --> 00:30:01,123
Granger Venture Partners.

414
00:30:01,256 --> 00:30:02,691
What does Trip do?

415
00:30:02,825 --> 00:30:04,359
He tans well,
parties even better,

416
00:30:04,492 --> 00:30:06,260
and has a unique talent
for ending up

417
00:30:06,394 --> 00:30:08,029
on Page Six for the latter.

418
00:30:08,997 --> 00:30:11,533
Trip had a heart
attack early this morning.

419
00:30:12,401 --> 00:30:15,003
He was airlifted from Montauk
on his father's jet.

420
00:30:15,136 --> 00:30:18,138
We're also treating
his girlfriend, Holly Matson.

421
00:30:18,906 --> 00:30:22,242
I saw her today, too.
She was cut up pretty badly.

422
00:30:22,376 --> 00:30:24,078
That's strange...

423
00:30:25,881 --> 00:30:27,548
No, Trip
didn't have any lacerations.

424
00:30:27,682 --> 00:30:29,919
I'm assuming they were
in some sort of accident?

425
00:30:31,086 --> 00:30:33,621
Why do we suddenly need
a spiritual/legal/

426
00:30:33,755 --> 00:30:35,524
whatever-you-are watchdog?

427
00:30:35,656 --> 00:30:38,560
The circumstances have changed.
I have a letter from the board.

428
00:30:39,661 --> 00:30:41,129
"At approximately 5:15 a.m.,

429
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:44,133
Emmett Granger contacted
Chairman Scott Lacey.

430
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:46,235
He wanted the board to be
aware of his appreciation

431
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:48,035
for past care,
and understood that we would

432
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:50,305
do everything humanly
possible for his son.

433
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:53,875
As a show of gratitude, and
regardless of Trip's prognosis,

434
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:55,644
he informed Chairman Lacey

435
00:30:55,777 --> 00:30:58,881
that he would recommend
a $25 million grant

436
00:30:59,013 --> 00:31:02,149
from The Granger Institute
to St. Augustine Hospital.

437
00:31:02,284 --> 00:31:04,954
The board places full trust
in you, the Heart Committee,

438
00:31:05,086 --> 00:31:07,890
to make the right decision
regarding Trip Granger."

439
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,993
You can't be serious.
$25 million?

440
00:31:12,126 --> 00:31:14,696
I don't get out of bed
for less than 30.

441
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:16,831
What does it mean,
he would "recommend"

442
00:31:16,965 --> 00:31:18,766
a grant
from the Granger Institute?

443
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,567
He is the Granger Institute.

444
00:31:20,701 --> 00:31:22,403
It's a loophole.

445
00:31:22,537 --> 00:31:24,940
We don't get the money
if Trip doesn't get the heart.

446
00:31:25,074 --> 00:31:27,109
- He's bribing us.
- Bingo.

447
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:28,509
Not exactly.

448
00:31:28,644 --> 00:31:30,278
"Regardless
of Trip's prognosis."

449
00:31:32,913 --> 00:31:35,450
Disregard the letter.
We remain objective.

450
00:31:35,584 --> 00:31:37,085
I hope we can.

451
00:31:37,218 --> 00:31:39,989
Unconsciously, this could
prejudice us against Trip.

452
00:31:40,122 --> 00:31:42,990
Or the opposite.
Come on, let's be real.

453
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:45,192
This place
has seen better days.

454
00:31:45,326 --> 00:31:48,130
Our equipment is prehistoric,
we're short-staffed.

455
00:31:48,262 --> 00:31:51,365
They can't even finish
the renovation, for God's sake!

456
00:31:52,032 --> 00:31:55,770
We pick Trip, and we're saving
much more than one patient.

457
00:31:55,903 --> 00:31:57,873
Now, of course, we can't
let the money decide,

458
00:31:58,006 --> 00:31:59,975
but black and white this ain't.

459
00:32:00,107 --> 00:32:02,644
I disagree. I think
the money should be irrelevant.

460
00:32:02,778 --> 00:32:05,212
I'm surprised the board
would even make us aware.

461
00:32:05,346 --> 00:32:06,949
You are so young.

462
00:32:08,116 --> 00:32:11,219
The board wants Trip
to get the heart.

463
00:32:11,353 --> 00:32:12,653
Uh, that's false.

464
00:32:12,787 --> 00:32:14,221
They were concerned
that Mr. Granger

465
00:32:14,355 --> 00:32:16,057
would reach out
to one of you personally.

466
00:32:16,191 --> 00:32:18,293
They sent me to ensure
that any decision you make

467
00:32:18,425 --> 00:32:19,927
would be irrefutable.

468
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,497
As you know, many
of these transplant decisions

469
00:32:22,631 --> 00:32:24,633
- end up in courtrooms.
- Very clever,

470
00:32:24,766 --> 00:32:27,134
sending in a priest
to do their dirty work.

471
00:32:27,269 --> 00:32:30,104
All right, just relax. We're
waiting on Trip's drug results.

472
00:32:30,238 --> 00:32:31,773
The decision
could be made for us.

473
00:32:31,905 --> 00:32:33,709
- How so?
- If a patient's been using,

474
00:32:33,842 --> 00:32:35,844
they're ineligible. UNOS rules.

475
00:32:35,978 --> 00:32:37,846
As you may have
gleaned from our rating,

476
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,914
it's hard enough to keep
a transplanted heart ticking.

477
00:32:40,048 --> 00:32:42,416
You add chems to that,
and it's sayonara, baby.

478
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,886
And Trip
isn't exactly a saint.

479
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:46,922
He OD'd on cocaine
nine months ago.

480
00:32:47,055 --> 00:32:49,991
Let's table Trip and move on.
Who's the other match?

481
00:33:17,751 --> 00:33:19,787
Sorry, Andy.

482
00:33:35,737 --> 00:33:37,505
Uh, Macallan, neat.

483
00:33:38,173 --> 00:33:41,910
And a Ketel One martini
for the lady, extra dry.

484
00:33:42,943 --> 00:33:44,278
Good memory.

485
00:33:44,412 --> 00:33:46,146
I always remember
a person's drink.

486
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,017
It's like a window
into the soul.

487
00:33:49,785 --> 00:33:51,753
I actually really
should be getting home.

488
00:33:51,886 --> 00:33:54,155
One drink. We're celebrating.

489
00:33:54,288 --> 00:33:56,258
What's the occasion?

490
00:33:57,525 --> 00:34:00,394
Yesterday, there were
nine programs in the U.S.

491
00:34:00,528 --> 00:34:02,063
with a rating north of 85.

492
00:34:02,196 --> 00:34:04,432
Today, my friend,
there are ten.

493
00:34:04,566 --> 00:34:07,702
You complete me, Dr. Taylor.

494
00:34:09,871 --> 00:34:11,606
You don't seem pleased.

495
00:34:11,974 --> 00:34:14,309
I guess I... I just,
I'm not sure how I'm supposed

496
00:34:14,442 --> 00:34:16,411
to feel about that.
What does it signify?

497
00:34:16,545 --> 00:34:18,713
That you run a clean program?
Don't overthink it.

498
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:25,285
I've been waking up a lot

499
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,622
in the middle
of the night lately.

500
00:34:27,755 --> 00:34:29,324
It's not fun.

501
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:32,960
Normally, I just go for a run,
but... last night,

502
00:34:33,094 --> 00:34:36,830
I just laid in bed, staring
at the ceiling for hours,

503
00:34:36,965 --> 00:34:39,100
doing math, of all things.

504
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,735
Factoring in
our survival numbers,

505
00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:44,438
billings, pro rating
by time period...

506
00:34:44,572 --> 00:34:46,307
Sounds painful.

507
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,009
It was more painful when
I realized what I was doing.

508
00:34:49,143 --> 00:34:50,878
Which was?

509
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:55,484
Trying to figure out
what a day of life is worth.

510
00:34:58,186 --> 00:35:01,155
It's always been
about maximizing assets, Jordan.

511
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:04,927
Unfortunately, the assets
happen to be human organs.

512
00:35:06,193 --> 00:35:07,896
You don't sound much
like a priest.

513
00:35:08,028 --> 00:35:10,465
Ha. And you don't sound
much like a doctor.

514
00:35:20,175 --> 00:35:22,244
Let's just hope that Boxer
has cracked it.

515
00:35:22,376 --> 00:35:24,512
Then we can get back
to our real jobs, eh?

516
00:35:24,646 --> 00:35:26,581
- Yeah.
- Have you spoken to him?

517
00:35:26,713 --> 00:35:29,016
I'm curious as to why
he hasn't listed himself.

518
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:33,487
No... wait,
why would he list himself?

519
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:39,260
Charlie?

520
00:35:41,528 --> 00:35:43,132
Rumor has it...

521
00:35:44,032 --> 00:35:46,434
He's got a bad heart.

522
00:35:59,213 --> 00:36:01,082
<i>Marambaia topaz,</i>

523
00:36:01,215 --> 00:36:03,684
<i>the finest topaz
in the world...</i>

524
00:36:05,353 --> 00:36:06,521
Huh.

525
00:36:08,655 --> 00:36:10,759
There's some Zabar's
in the fridge.

526
00:36:10,893 --> 00:36:13,561
Thanks for
helping out, Mom.

527
00:36:13,695 --> 00:36:15,663
I missed
the Save Venice benefit.

528
00:36:15,797 --> 00:36:19,099
Why is it that Rosa gets sick
every time I have a party?

529
00:36:19,233 --> 00:36:21,235
I don't know.
Maybe it's a conspiracy.

530
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:24,038
Or maybe it's because
you have a party every night?

531
00:36:24,972 --> 00:36:29,311
Mommy? Will I get more
handsome if I kiss a princess?

532
00:36:31,914 --> 00:36:34,950
We watched
"Beauty and the Beast".

533
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:37,351
He was quite taken with it.

534
00:36:37,485 --> 00:36:39,987
Do you know a princess?

535
00:36:41,757 --> 00:36:44,358
Come here, my little monster.

536
00:36:46,661 --> 00:36:48,864
Can I sleep
in your bed, Mommy?

537
00:36:48,996 --> 00:36:50,531
Are you really gonna sleep?

538
00:36:50,664 --> 00:36:53,101
Or are you gonna just
kick me all night?

539
00:36:53,233 --> 00:36:55,336
- Sleep.
- Okay.

540
00:36:59,873 --> 00:37:05,212
Our third match
for the heart is Janet Pike,

541
00:37:05,347 --> 00:37:06,949
who's been on the waiting list

542
00:37:07,081 --> 00:37:09,917
since we classified
her 1-A three weeks ago.

543
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,653
Like Walter Curtis,
it wasn't unanimous...

544
00:37:14,054 --> 00:37:15,690
<i>Its thighs and wings</i>

545
00:37:15,824 --> 00:37:17,992
<i>are USDA-inspected
by the US Department of what?</i>

546
00:37:18,126 --> 00:37:19,393
Agriculture!

547
00:37:19,527 --> 00:37:20,961
- <i>Camille?</i>
- <i>Agriculture!</i>

548
00:37:21,094 --> 00:37:22,496
<i>Is correct!</i>

549
00:37:24,231 --> 00:37:26,634
Positives: Janet's 59.
Solid insurance.

550
00:37:26,768 --> 00:37:29,003
She inherited a lot
of money from her husband,

551
00:37:29,137 --> 00:37:31,306
who died on 9/11.
Cantor Fitzgerald.

552
00:37:31,438 --> 00:37:34,375
<i>"I'll flip my lid if you know
what round brimless hat..."</i>

553
00:37:34,509 --> 00:37:36,110
Time for
your meds, Janet.

554
00:37:36,244 --> 00:37:38,880
Take a hike,
I'm watchin' my show!

555
00:37:39,014 --> 00:37:40,581
- Pillbox!
- <i>Pillbox!</i>

556
00:37:40,715 --> 00:37:44,619
- <i>Is correct!</i>
- Negatives: I'm single.

557
00:37:44,751 --> 00:37:48,222
I don't have children
or any other family.

558
00:37:48,356 --> 00:37:51,359
I haven't worked
since my husband passed away.

559
00:37:51,492 --> 00:37:55,130
On paper, she doesn't have
an established support system.

560
00:37:55,929 --> 00:37:57,698
I'm fine with Janet
getting this heart,

561
00:37:57,831 --> 00:38:00,902
assuming that it's between
her and Walter Curtis.

562
00:38:01,036 --> 00:38:02,470
I'm on board with that.

563
00:38:02,603 --> 00:38:04,606
Why, 'cause she passed
her wallet autopsy?

564
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:07,041
- Have you read my reports?
- Yes, I have.

565
00:38:07,175 --> 00:38:08,810
And I've examined her myself.

566
00:38:08,943 --> 00:38:11,545
It's not financial.
Janet's healthier than Walter.

567
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:14,782
She has a better shot
of sustaining post-op,

568
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:16,784
even without
the support system.

569
00:38:16,918 --> 00:38:19,287
Well, she's demanding
and impatient with the nurses.

570
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,987
In other words, she's a bitch.

571
00:38:21,121 --> 00:38:22,723
Wow, that's insightful.

572
00:38:22,858 --> 00:38:24,659
The sort of analytical
thinking that's about

573
00:38:24,793 --> 00:38:26,027
to submarine this program.

574
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:27,527
Here's a fact for you:

575
00:38:27,661 --> 00:38:29,429
Janet's ambivalent
about a transplant.

576
00:38:29,563 --> 00:38:31,132
The idea of having
someone else's heart

577
00:38:31,266 --> 00:38:32,901
in her body
is disturbing to her.

578
00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:34,269
Yet she still listed.

579
00:38:34,402 --> 00:38:35,869
You want Walter
to have the heart.

580
00:38:36,003 --> 00:38:37,205
I told you, I'm abstaining.

581
00:38:37,338 --> 00:38:38,974
You have to vote on this.

582
00:38:39,106 --> 00:38:41,175
We are not classifying.
What is the conflict?

583
00:38:42,309 --> 00:38:45,278
Nine years ago,
Walter tried to commit suicide.

584
00:38:45,413 --> 00:38:47,449
He ingested
a bottle of Percocet.

585
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,952
Jesus. And you cleared him
after that?

586
00:38:52,086 --> 00:38:53,820
He was diagnosed Bipolar.

587
00:38:53,954 --> 00:38:56,523
He started on Lithium, and
he's been stable ever since.

588
00:38:56,657 --> 00:38:59,561
I didn't think he was
a suicide risk any longer.

589
00:38:59,693 --> 00:39:02,297
So, what's the problem?
Why can't you vote?

590
00:39:10,405 --> 00:39:14,509
I lost my daughter
five months ago. She overdosed.

591
00:39:18,847 --> 00:39:20,148
I'm so sorry.

592
00:39:20,782 --> 00:39:23,552
Point is,
I can't evaluate Walter fairly.

593
00:39:27,389 --> 00:39:29,624
I think the suicide is
a disqualifier.

594
00:39:30,657 --> 00:39:32,993
Besides, there's so many
other issues with this patient.

595
00:39:33,695 --> 00:39:35,397
Can I ask you
something, Dr. Boxer?

596
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,198
Aren't these decisions
supposed to be made

597
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:38,833
on pragmatic, medical grounds?

598
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:41,903
- They are.
- So... who are you to judge?

599
00:39:42,036 --> 00:39:44,172
You can't possibly understand
what Walter was going through.

600
00:39:44,304 --> 00:39:46,474
I'd say an attempted
suicide is pretty relevant

601
00:39:46,608 --> 00:39:48,576
to a character evaluation,
wouldn't you?

602
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,644
Who knows? Evaluating someone's
true character...

603
00:39:50,778 --> 00:39:54,315
or soul, if you will... seems
like a risky proposition to me.

604
00:39:54,449 --> 00:39:56,416
It's like waving a welcome mat
to a Jehovah's Witness.

605
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,186
Father,
this is standard.

606
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,021
Yeah, but it doesn't
change the fact

607
00:40:00,153 --> 00:40:02,123
that you're making decisions
based on personal perception.

608
00:40:02,255 --> 00:40:03,524
He's not on the stand.

609
00:40:03,657 --> 00:40:05,192
He might be.
You all might be.

610
00:40:05,327 --> 00:40:07,129
If you make choices
based on anything

611
00:40:07,262 --> 00:40:09,497
that can't be quantified,
you're playing God.

612
00:40:10,231 --> 00:40:11,466
I'll be first to step aside

613
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,433
when God walks in here
and votes.

614
00:40:14,202 --> 00:40:16,204
In ten years,
I haven't seen Him yet.

615
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,575
I'm sorry to hear that.

616
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:22,777
And I'm sure the board
would be sorry to hear

617
00:40:22,911 --> 00:40:24,679
you're supporting anyone
other than Trip Granger.

618
00:40:24,811 --> 00:40:27,081
I'm not supporting anyone,
Dr. Boxer.

619
00:40:29,384 --> 00:40:30,784
<i>It's Pope.</i>

620
00:40:30,918 --> 00:40:32,753
Trip Granger's drug test
results are ready.

621
00:40:32,887 --> 00:40:37,191
Thank you. Bring them up,
and we'll make a decision.

622
00:40:37,324 --> 00:40:39,260
Let's reconvene in ten.

623
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:04,619
Boxer, we're ready for you.

624
00:41:06,253 --> 00:41:08,123
Uh, give me ten.

625
00:41:30,411 --> 00:41:32,579
Release
the perinephric fat.

626
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,824
Okay, kidney out.

627
00:41:48,362 --> 00:41:49,864
Scalpel.

628
00:41:58,739 --> 00:42:00,507
Shit.

629
00:42:00,641 --> 00:42:02,175
Boxer, you okay?

630
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:04,812
I'm fine.

631
00:42:07,815 --> 00:42:09,617
I'm fine.

632
00:42:45,954 --> 00:42:47,388
Good job out there, Pope.

633
00:42:47,521 --> 00:42:49,324
You almost fucked it up.

634
00:42:50,724 --> 00:42:52,560
That's the last time
you operate.

635
00:42:53,427 --> 00:42:55,163
I'll be the judge of that.

636
00:42:55,295 --> 00:42:56,431
You need
to disclose your illness

637
00:42:56,563 --> 00:42:57,897
and name a successor.

638
00:42:58,032 --> 00:42:59,533
I don't need to do shit.

639
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,672
Boxer. Those people out there?
They've bled for this.

640
00:43:05,806 --> 00:43:07,942
Not to mention the investors,
who have a right to know

641
00:43:08,074 --> 00:43:10,644
- where their money's going!
- There are no investors.

642
00:43:11,478 --> 00:43:13,146
Granger pulled out?

643
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,117
Not officially.

644
00:43:16,251 --> 00:43:18,452
Found out about my condition.

645
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:22,455
He's keeping it quiet for now,
but... if it gets out,

646
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,659
it'll spook the rest of them.

647
00:43:26,094 --> 00:43:27,596
Fantastic.

648
00:43:29,429 --> 00:43:30,931
What's your plan?

649
00:43:31,065 --> 00:43:32,934
Prove the tech
with the animal trial.

650
00:43:33,067 --> 00:43:35,101
Maybe Granger
has a change of heart.

651
00:43:35,235 --> 00:43:37,938
If not, I talk to the others,
convince 'em to come in

652
00:43:38,072 --> 00:43:39,640
with you running the show...

653
00:43:39,773 --> 00:43:41,742
It'll be months before we know
if the monkey

654
00:43:41,876 --> 00:43:44,245
- can keep down the kidney.
- So we tread water.

655
00:43:44,378 --> 00:43:46,547
You may not make it that long.

656
00:43:50,617 --> 00:43:53,387
I don't mean to be insensitive.

657
00:43:54,621 --> 00:43:57,424
I can't imagine
what you must be going through.

658
00:44:00,126 --> 00:44:01,762
We all die.

659
00:44:03,097 --> 00:44:07,268
What concerns me are the...
things I can still control.

660
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,471
The loose ends.

661
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:43,103
You wanna know why the priest
isn't practicing law anymore?

662
00:44:43,237 --> 00:44:46,206
No, but something tells me
you're about to enlighten me.

663
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,142
He was disbarred in 2006.

664
00:44:48,275 --> 00:44:49,810
For manipulating evidence.

665
00:44:49,943 --> 00:44:51,811
Instead of going to prison,
where he belongs,

666
00:44:51,945 --> 00:44:53,780
he managed to finagle
some deal with the DA

667
00:44:53,914 --> 00:44:55,483
by telling everyone
he found God.

668
00:44:55,615 --> 00:44:58,686
- Maybe he did.
- What?

669
00:44:59,686 --> 00:45:02,123
- Find God.
- Give me a break!

670
00:45:02,255 --> 00:45:03,958
Scott Lacey says he trusts him.

671
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:05,393
Yeah, I believe that.

672
00:45:05,525 --> 00:45:06,827
I believe the board
fully trusts him

673
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,728
to make a crooked deal with
Granger.

674
00:45:08,862 --> 00:45:11,665
"The art of rebirth."
Priest must be a fucking genius.

675
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,702
What do you want me
to do about it?

676
00:45:13,835 --> 00:45:15,970
- Kick him out of the meeting!
- Oh, fuck off!

677
00:45:16,103 --> 00:45:18,039
I do that, and the board
will demand my resignation.

678
00:45:18,172 --> 00:45:19,907
I'm already on thin ice
with the rating.

679
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:21,976
Why are you
so bent out of shape?

680
00:45:22,108 --> 00:45:23,509
Because it's bullshit.

681
00:45:23,643 --> 00:45:25,178
Suddenly there's money
in the equation,

682
00:45:25,311 --> 00:45:27,246
we got this guy looking over
our shoulder. I've spent

683
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,750
ten years of my life on this
committee. This is bullshit.

684
00:45:29,884 --> 00:45:32,186
So it's about respect?
Talk about bullshit.

685
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:34,889
You're just hung up
on your friendship with Granger.

686
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:37,490
- We're not friends, Val.
- Call it what you will.

687
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:39,260
You don't want to vote
on his kid,

688
00:45:39,393 --> 00:45:40,994
but you know
you might have to.

689
00:45:41,128 --> 00:45:43,063
And you don't think the priest
can keep it confidential

690
00:45:43,197 --> 00:45:46,401
if you have to let
the kid die. Is that it?

691
00:45:58,711 --> 00:46:01,382
Okay, Holly, this might
sting a little, okay?

692
00:46:11,224 --> 00:46:13,860
Hey, how was the first
day on the committee?

693
00:46:13,994 --> 00:46:16,131
Still going.
Coffee break.

694
00:46:17,264 --> 00:46:19,365
That's Trip Granger's
girlfriend, right?

695
00:46:19,867 --> 00:46:22,437
- How's she doing?
- Oh, she's gonna be fine.

696
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:24,472
It's the fetus
we're concerned about.

697
00:46:26,507 --> 00:46:28,809
- Ten weeks.
- Excuse me.

698
00:46:28,943 --> 00:46:31,012
Oh, uh, sorry, intensive care
has restricted visiting hours...

699
00:46:31,144 --> 00:46:33,181
If you have an issue,
contact Mr. Lacey.

700
00:46:33,313 --> 00:46:35,115
Chair of the hospital board.

701
00:46:36,684 --> 00:46:38,486
Hello, Holly.

702
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,594
And Trip's the father?

703
00:46:50,297 --> 00:46:51,666
What happened to her?

704
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,268
I don't know.
She won't tell me.

705
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,177
- Trip Granger's blood report.
- Thank you.

706
00:47:15,389 --> 00:47:17,224
He tested positive for cocaine.

707
00:47:20,927 --> 00:47:22,896
Idiot.

708
00:47:23,898 --> 00:47:25,733
Are these drug tests
ever wrong?

709
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:28,602
Well, they're 90% accurate.
We only do a second one

710
00:47:28,735 --> 00:47:30,871
if the patient
disputes the results.

711
00:47:31,005 --> 00:47:34,008
Since Trip's unconscious,
that's obviously not happening.

712
00:47:38,478 --> 00:47:40,881
Next time, try a fundraiser.

713
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:46,153
This has been a blast, but we'd
like to get back to work now.

714
00:47:46,653 --> 00:47:48,523
I think I'll stick around.

715
00:47:51,791 --> 00:47:53,627
All right,
let's get this over with.

716
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,728
Walter Curtis or Janet Pike?

717
00:47:55,862 --> 00:47:58,565
Let me say
one last thing before we vote.

718
00:47:59,266 --> 00:48:01,336
One last thing, Boxer!

719
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:05,439
Look, as far as we know,
Janet Pike may not

720
00:48:05,572 --> 00:48:07,473
even want this transplant.

721
00:48:07,608 --> 00:48:10,411
We know Walter wants this.

722
00:48:10,777 --> 00:48:12,346
For his family, for himself.

723
00:48:12,478 --> 00:48:14,013
Walter wants to live.

724
00:48:14,581 --> 00:48:18,085
And for me, people, that tells
me everything I need to know.

725
00:48:18,485 --> 00:48:20,920
Okay. What happens when Walter
has another episode,

726
00:48:21,054 --> 00:48:22,655
and he finds something
stronger than Percocet

727
00:48:22,789 --> 00:48:23,923
in his medicine cabinet?

728
00:48:24,057 --> 00:48:25,559
That's not fair.

729
00:48:25,693 --> 00:48:27,661
Dr. Lau passed him
on the psych eval.

730
00:48:27,795 --> 00:48:29,530
So he had
a moment of despair.

731
00:48:29,664 --> 00:48:31,299
That's scary, I get it.

732
00:48:31,431 --> 00:48:34,001
But that was before
he was diagnosed Bipolar.

733
00:48:34,135 --> 00:48:37,138
I've been through dark times.
Everybody has!

734
00:48:37,271 --> 00:48:39,974
He had
an upper-respiratory infection.

735
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,844
- Walter?
- No. Sorry. Trip.

736
00:48:42,976 --> 00:48:44,610
I was double-checking his file.

737
00:48:44,744 --> 00:48:46,246
Granger's pilot
claimed Trip was sick.

738
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,382
He wasn't sure
if he was taking an antibiotic.

739
00:48:48,514 --> 00:48:51,518
Ampicillin can test
as a false positive for cocaine.

740
00:48:51,652 --> 00:48:53,721
You think his drug test
was wrong?

741
00:48:53,855 --> 00:48:55,657
It's possible.

742
00:48:58,458 --> 00:49:01,362
Not to overcomplicate things,
but Trip's girlfriend,

743
00:49:01,494 --> 00:49:04,364
Holly Matson?
She's pregnant.

744
00:49:04,498 --> 00:49:05,698
Please tell me you're kidding.

745
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:07,535
How do you know that?

746
00:49:07,668 --> 00:49:09,969
I ran into Nurse Cruz, who's
treating her, on my break.

747
00:49:10,103 --> 00:49:12,873
- If it is a false positive...
- But that's a big "if".

748
00:49:13,007 --> 00:49:15,275
I realize that. But if it is,
a strong argument could be

749
00:49:15,409 --> 00:49:18,579
made for Trip. He's gonna have
a family to support.

750
00:49:18,713 --> 00:49:21,014
Are you sure about that,
Dr. Taylor?

751
00:49:21,581 --> 00:49:23,449
What if he won't support them?

752
00:49:52,913 --> 00:49:54,615
Boxer, it's me...

753
00:49:56,916 --> 00:49:58,987
I've left you, like,
five messages.

754
00:50:34,188 --> 00:50:36,958
Don't get too excited.
I'm not dead yet.

755
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:40,795
I'll try to contain
my disappointment.

756
00:50:42,896 --> 00:50:44,764
I'm not a candidate.

757
00:50:44,898 --> 00:50:47,434
You've come here
to convince me to list.

758
00:50:47,568 --> 00:50:49,403
You're wasting your time.

759
00:50:49,536 --> 00:50:51,504
Let the committee decide that.

760
00:50:58,211 --> 00:51:00,880
You look better
than I thought you would've.

761
00:51:01,014 --> 00:51:02,983
Charming. As always.

762
00:51:03,117 --> 00:51:04,885
It's a compliment,
trust me.

763
00:51:05,018 --> 00:51:06,786
In my experience,
serving on that committee

764
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,722
isn't exactly
the fountain of youth.

765
00:51:12,259 --> 00:51:13,860
Coffee?

766
00:51:18,398 --> 00:51:21,269
Severe Pulmonary Hypertension
brought on by CHD.

767
00:51:23,137 --> 00:51:25,405
By UNOS standards,
I'm not eligible.

768
00:51:27,507 --> 00:51:31,044
Regardless, I wouldn't survive
12 months with a transplant.

769
00:51:32,914 --> 00:51:35,216
You've known
about this your entire...

770
00:51:37,184 --> 00:51:39,420
Why didn't you just tell me?

771
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,554
What difference
would it have made?

772
00:51:42,356 --> 00:51:44,158
You would've just
felt sorry for me.

773
00:51:45,259 --> 00:51:47,327
I also might've liked you more.

774
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,096
Why's that?

775
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:52,300
You said you became a doctor
because you were good at it.

776
00:51:52,432 --> 00:51:54,902
I always thought
that was a really shitty reason.

777
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,275
I suppose it's because I always
thought of it as a curse.

778
00:52:03,943 --> 00:52:06,947
Maybe because it's the only
thing my father ever gave me.

779
00:52:24,465 --> 00:52:26,432
Why did you come here?

780
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:36,344
I think you should meet Hunter.

781
00:52:38,278 --> 00:52:39,947
I know you don't give a shit.

782
00:52:40,081 --> 00:52:44,751
But do it for his sake,
so at least he can say

783
00:52:44,885 --> 00:52:46,787
that he met his father.

784
00:53:06,907 --> 00:53:09,110
Forget I asked.

785
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:36,001
I need to be prepping
one of them in 30 minutes.

786
00:53:36,135 --> 00:53:38,371
What are we doing, Val?

787
00:53:41,909 --> 00:53:44,510
Trip deserves an opportunity
while there's still time.

788
00:53:45,711 --> 00:53:48,315
We won't be able to run
another test in a half hour.

789
00:53:48,449 --> 00:53:50,784
Sure, but I can call Trip's GP,

790
00:53:50,918 --> 00:53:52,251
ask if he prescribed
any medication.

791
00:53:52,385 --> 00:53:53,987
In the meantime,
Nurse Wilkes will go

792
00:53:54,121 --> 00:53:55,956
through his belongings
and look for medication.

793
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:57,658
We reconvene
in 15 for the vote.

794
00:53:57,791 --> 00:54:00,161
Uh, stupid question,
Val, but why doesn't someone

795
00:54:00,293 --> 00:54:02,195
just speak to Holly Matson?
I'm sure she knows

796
00:54:02,329 --> 00:54:04,532
what Trip's
been putting in his body.

797
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:12,139
- Just... a suggestion.
- I'll take care of it.

798
00:54:13,206 --> 00:54:14,875
Maybe Dr. Taylor can help.

799
00:54:15,009 --> 00:54:17,244
Seems to me you have
a lot on your plate.

800
00:54:18,646 --> 00:54:21,081
I'd be happy
to talk to Holly Madsen.

801
00:54:21,215 --> 00:54:22,583
Who knows, we may also get

802
00:54:22,715 --> 00:54:25,184
some color
for the character evaluation.

803
00:54:37,898 --> 00:54:40,067
Holly?
I'm Dr. Taylor.

804
00:54:40,201 --> 00:54:42,302
I'm a cardiovascular surgeon.

805
00:54:42,436 --> 00:54:44,605
And I'm also on
the Heart Transplant Committee.

806
00:54:45,606 --> 00:54:48,409
I'm afraid Trip
isn't doing so well.

807
00:54:50,978 --> 00:54:53,981
I know you've been through
a lot, but there's a heart

808
00:54:54,114 --> 00:54:55,882
on its way to St. Augustine
right now,

809
00:54:56,016 --> 00:54:57,818
and we may be able to give that
to Trip,

810
00:54:57,951 --> 00:55:01,155
but I'm gonna have to
ask you some questions. Okay?

811
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,262
I need to know
if Trip was using drugs.

812
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:21,275
Holly... what happened to you?

813
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:24,678
I can't talk to you.

814
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:26,813
Why can't you talk to me?

815
00:55:27,146 --> 00:55:28,615
Is it because of Trip's father?

816
00:55:28,748 --> 00:55:30,583
- Please leave.
- Why wouldn't Mr. Granger

817
00:55:30,717 --> 00:55:33,653
- want you to talk to me?
- I asked you to leave!

818
00:55:42,429 --> 00:55:44,431
Holly,
can I tell you something?

819
00:55:48,668 --> 00:55:51,137
I think I might
be pregnant, too.

820
00:55:57,811 --> 00:55:59,480
And I am also scared.

821
00:56:04,851 --> 00:56:07,253
I mean, I always imagined
myself as a mother.

822
00:56:07,387 --> 00:56:10,190
But here I am,
approaching 40...

823
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:15,161
I don't know if...
the thing is...

824
00:56:16,128 --> 00:56:17,998
I'm in this on my own.

825
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:21,402
There is no father.

826
00:56:26,773 --> 00:56:28,476
I feel like a coward.

827
00:56:31,244 --> 00:56:33,547
And so alone.

828
00:56:44,824 --> 00:56:46,559
I want a lawyer.

829
00:56:47,226 --> 00:56:48,828
I can get you a lawyer.

830
00:56:49,329 --> 00:56:52,199
And I promise that nothing
you say in here

831
00:56:52,331 --> 00:56:54,100
will get back to them.

832
00:56:58,405 --> 00:56:59,940
Did Trip hurt you?

833
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,876
He found out
I was pregnant, okay?

834
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:06,113
That's what happened to me.

835
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:20,094
Trip woke up in the middle
of the night with chest pains.

836
00:57:21,327 --> 00:57:22,996
He doesn't trust
the Montauk hospital,

837
00:57:23,128 --> 00:57:27,333
so I called the pilot to tell
him to get the plane ready.

838
00:57:28,335 --> 00:57:31,070
We were on our way
to the airport and...

839
00:57:31,704 --> 00:57:34,240
I started to feel sick,
like I was gonna throw up.

840
00:57:34,375 --> 00:57:37,110
So I asked Trip to pull over.

841
00:57:41,315 --> 00:57:43,682
With his condition,
he's, like, super paranoid

842
00:57:43,817 --> 00:57:46,519
about germs,
so he starts freaking out.

843
00:57:46,653 --> 00:57:51,090
Shouting, accusing me
of trying to kill him.

844
00:57:56,496 --> 00:57:59,332
I had to tell him
it was morning sickness.

845
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,568
Talk about bad timing.

846
00:58:04,003 --> 00:58:05,672
He then threw me out of the car

847
00:58:05,806 --> 00:58:07,807
in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

848
00:58:10,777 --> 00:58:14,581
I didn't realize my jacket was
caught in the door until he...

849
00:58:17,016 --> 00:58:18,785
I guess he didn't hear me.

850
00:58:20,653 --> 00:58:22,789
Thank God the pilot
came back for me.

851
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:29,396
He won't get the transplant
now, will he?

852
00:58:29,528 --> 00:58:32,599
We take a lot of things
into consideration.

853
00:58:36,168 --> 00:58:41,141
Well, Trip wasn't using.
He's been sober for a while now.

854
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:47,380
What about antibiotics?
Was he taking antibiotics?

855
00:58:47,914 --> 00:58:50,316
I don't know. I mean,
he's always taking something.

856
00:58:50,449 --> 00:58:53,153
His medicine cabinet's
like a pharmacy.

857
00:58:59,092 --> 00:59:01,394
I'm gonna come back later, okay?

858
00:59:02,496 --> 00:59:04,331
I will help you, Holly.

859
00:59:06,065 --> 00:59:07,534
Wait, Dr. Taylor?

860
00:59:10,704 --> 00:59:14,575
He loves me. He just has
a fucked up way of showing it.

861
00:59:35,394 --> 00:59:38,798
- Hi.
- Hi.

862
00:59:41,201 --> 00:59:42,670
Come on in.

863
00:59:49,141 --> 00:59:51,911
Sweetie, I want you
to meet my friend, Andre.

864
00:59:54,581 --> 00:59:56,617
Is that for Hunter?

865
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:06,994
You do know he's six?

866
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,428
He'll grow into it.

867
01:00:09,563 --> 01:00:12,833
Is that a present
for me? Thank you!

868
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,270
You're welcome.

869
01:00:36,123 --> 01:00:37,624
What is that?

870
01:00:37,757 --> 01:00:41,094
It's me and my mommy,
and I have super powers.

871
01:00:41,226 --> 01:00:42,628
We're in our secret hideout.

872
01:00:42,762 --> 01:00:44,431
Why are you
both wearing dresses?

873
01:00:44,563 --> 01:00:47,166
Mommy's wearing
a dress. That's my cape!

874
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,170
- What are your powers?
- Those are a secret.

875
01:00:50,302 --> 01:00:53,606
Only my best friend Cal knows,
'cause they're really powerful.

876
01:00:56,141 --> 01:01:00,380
- Like X-ray vision?
- No, they're real powers.

877
01:01:01,347 --> 01:01:03,083
People don't have real powers.

878
01:01:03,215 --> 01:01:04,817
Boxer...

879
01:01:04,951 --> 01:01:08,121
Careful, it's hot. Blow on it,
blow on it. Like this.

880
01:01:14,427 --> 01:01:17,864
Mmm. Tastes real good.

881
01:01:29,876 --> 01:01:31,644
Yeah?

882
01:01:33,346 --> 01:01:35,447
Fuck are you
talking about?

883
01:01:35,581 --> 01:01:37,849
When? When did it happen?

884
01:01:48,193 --> 01:01:49,929
Start the autopsy.

885
01:01:50,563 --> 01:01:52,065
We have to determine
if this was cellular

886
01:01:52,197 --> 01:01:55,469
or if we have to revise
the immunosuppressive RG.

887
01:01:57,737 --> 01:01:59,105
What's the company line?

888
01:01:59,239 --> 01:02:02,476
Nothing! We say nothing.

889
01:02:04,744 --> 01:02:07,346
I want to be operating
on another monkey within a week.

890
01:02:08,047 --> 01:02:11,050
This is just a bump
in the road, nothing more!

891
01:02:22,762 --> 01:02:25,065
Just so you know, I'm on board

892
01:02:25,197 --> 01:02:27,634
with keeping this quiet
for the time being.

893
01:02:27,768 --> 01:02:30,003
Even though it's a very
gray area we're stepping into,

894
01:02:30,135 --> 01:02:31,637
my friend.

895
01:02:31,771 --> 01:02:34,908
All I ask is that you
consider Granger's offer.

896
01:02:35,842 --> 01:02:37,610
I want you to look at this.

897
01:02:38,244 --> 01:02:39,746
The answer is no.

898
01:02:40,313 --> 01:02:42,414
The heart's legit.
What the hell's your problem?

899
01:02:42,548 --> 01:02:45,751
My problem?
What's my problem?

900
01:02:45,885 --> 01:02:48,721
You're asking me to put a heart
that was purchased

901
01:02:48,855 --> 01:02:51,157
on the black market
into my body.

902
01:02:51,291 --> 01:02:53,126
That is my fucking problem.

903
01:02:56,396 --> 01:02:58,565
Everybody knows you're dying.

904
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:03,470
It's getting weird in there.
Tell the team, or I will.

905
01:04:07,099 --> 01:04:09,335
What're you doing down here?
We're back in soon.

906
01:04:09,469 --> 01:04:10,936
- Don't do it, Val.
- What?

907
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:12,939
Jumpstart a cokehead
to save your program.

908
01:04:13,072 --> 01:04:14,875
You don't know
if he's been using.

909
01:04:15,007 --> 01:04:16,942
Are you forgetting
I was Trip's physician

910
01:04:17,076 --> 01:04:19,146
before we went digital?
Or did you think I'd forget

911
01:04:19,278 --> 01:04:20,947
he's allergic to ampicillin?

912
01:04:24,351 --> 01:04:25,919
What are you insinuating?

913
01:04:26,052 --> 01:04:27,854
If you're desperate enough
to doctor his records,

914
01:04:27,987 --> 01:04:30,256
you're probably dumb enough
to plant antibiotics.

915
01:04:32,659 --> 01:04:35,729
Can we talk about this
in private, please?

916
01:04:38,431 --> 01:04:41,667
You have two options:
keep your mouth shut,

917
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,438
vote for Trip,
and everybody wins.

918
01:04:45,137 --> 01:04:47,706
Or you can tear me down,
and the house crumbles

919
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:50,842
- for you too, pal.
- What house is that?

920
01:04:50,976 --> 01:04:53,945
X-Origins. Your financing.

921
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:57,717
The deal you orchestrated
on the sly with Granger.

922
01:04:57,849 --> 01:04:59,286
That ring a bell?

923
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,822
It was very smart,
waiting to finalize

924
01:05:03,956 --> 01:05:06,125
until after
your employment here ends.

925
01:05:07,293 --> 01:05:10,061
But from my understanding,
Granger can still pull out.

926
01:05:10,195 --> 01:05:11,864
You're threatening me.
Is that it?

927
01:05:11,998 --> 01:05:14,733
No. Granger is threatening you.

928
01:05:14,867 --> 01:05:16,902
And the board,
where are they on this?

929
01:05:17,036 --> 01:05:18,703
They just want the 25 million.

930
01:05:18,838 --> 01:05:20,774
They don't need
to know the minutiae.

931
01:05:21,974 --> 01:05:23,610
You have got a sweet deal here.

932
01:05:23,744 --> 01:05:25,443
Why would you,
even for a second,

933
01:05:25,577 --> 01:05:26,846
consider jeopardizing it?

934
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:28,914
I don't know.

935
01:05:29,048 --> 01:05:31,117
Maybe the ten years I spent
building this program

936
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:33,452
with you still
means something to me.

937
01:05:33,586 --> 01:05:35,188
Jesus Christ.
Sometimes I wonder

938
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,589
if you're on the spectrum.
Are you not hearing me?

939
01:05:37,724 --> 01:05:39,859
Why would I risk
my career right now?

940
01:05:39,992 --> 01:05:41,862
Why would I risk this place,
this hospital?

941
01:05:41,994 --> 01:05:43,896
It's everything to me!

942
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:45,832
I have two failed marriages

943
01:05:45,965 --> 01:05:49,001
and three kids that won't take
my calls to prove it.

944
01:05:51,371 --> 01:05:53,773
- It's blood money.
- It sure is.

945
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:58,944
But we take it, and we put
it to work. Nothing is pure!

946
01:05:59,978 --> 01:06:02,481
Who do you think built
the libraries in this country?

947
01:06:02,614 --> 01:06:04,016
Andrew Carnegie.

948
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:06,619
He drove his steelworkers
80 hours a week!

949
01:06:06,753 --> 01:06:08,555
Do you think
they had time to read?

950
01:06:08,688 --> 01:06:12,658
Henry Ford beat back union
workers with a baseball bat,

951
01:06:12,793 --> 01:06:15,662
and now the Ford Foundation
uses his fortune

952
01:06:15,795 --> 01:06:19,699
for global human rights!
Nothing is pure!

953
01:06:21,233 --> 01:06:25,572
But I believe in you.
I believe in your research.

954
01:06:25,706 --> 01:06:27,472
And I guarantee you
that in 20 years,

955
01:06:27,606 --> 01:06:30,076
there's gonna be a hospital
with your name on it.

956
01:06:31,577 --> 01:06:33,746
I'd be happy with a wing.

957
01:06:41,954 --> 01:06:43,989
- Val?
- Yeah?

958
01:06:45,090 --> 01:06:47,860
I forget sometimes
that you were once a doctor.

959
01:06:51,498 --> 01:06:54,134
I'm gonna try
to remember you that way.

960
01:07:32,606 --> 01:07:34,941
What is God's will?

961
01:07:35,074 --> 01:07:38,144
How do we interpret it?

962
01:07:38,277 --> 01:07:41,847
How are we to understand it,
and act upon it?

963
01:07:45,418 --> 01:07:48,555
Scripture tells us
that as the sky soars

964
01:07:48,688 --> 01:07:53,593
beyond our reach, so are
God's ways beyond our own.

965
01:07:53,726 --> 01:07:56,229
But still,
we presume to understand

966
01:07:56,362 --> 01:07:58,897
what God means,
what He intends.

967
01:07:59,465 --> 01:08:03,570
We make presumptions
that distort His true will!

968
01:08:07,239 --> 01:08:10,008
It happens every day,
in a million different ways,

969
01:08:10,141 --> 01:08:11,744
and we are all guilty of it.

970
01:08:12,711 --> 01:08:16,949
These assumptions can blind us
to possibilities.

971
01:08:19,953 --> 01:08:23,824
Or worse, send us
spinning into delusion.

972
01:08:25,423 --> 01:08:29,296
Allow me to blow your minds:
God may not tell you

973
01:08:29,429 --> 01:08:31,029
what college to go to.

974
01:08:31,163 --> 01:08:33,399
He may not tell you
what job to take.

975
01:08:33,533 --> 01:08:36,570
He may not even tell you
what smartphones to buy!

976
01:08:38,438 --> 01:08:40,974
God will not smack you
on the head with answers.

977
01:08:41,106 --> 01:08:46,246
What He will do is He
will grant you the virtue

978
01:08:46,378 --> 01:08:49,949
to look deep inside yourself.
For the light.

979
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:53,286
Because, my friends,
let me tell you,

980
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:55,822
I'm a witness:
the light exists!

981
01:08:55,954 --> 01:08:58,890
The light exists!
The light exists!

982
01:09:47,106 --> 01:09:50,010
How badly does the board
want Granger to get the heart?

983
01:09:50,143 --> 01:09:52,244
I believe we've been over this.

984
01:09:52,377 --> 01:09:53,679
Let me rephrase.

985
01:09:57,117 --> 01:10:00,386
Are they willing
to risk it all for 25 mil?

986
01:10:05,524 --> 01:10:07,125
Check his allergies.

987
01:10:19,005 --> 01:10:20,472
Seems to me we have a problem.

988
01:10:20,606 --> 01:10:22,675
Only if you're willing
to do something about it.

989
01:10:22,807 --> 01:10:24,210
Why is that?

990
01:10:24,344 --> 01:10:26,011
Let's just say
I'm not in a position

991
01:10:26,145 --> 01:10:27,547
to aggravate Mr. Granger.

992
01:10:29,381 --> 01:10:31,082
What do you suppose I do?

993
01:10:31,216 --> 01:10:32,685
Alert the board.

994
01:10:32,819 --> 01:10:34,487
Have security escort
Dr. Gilroy from the room.

995
01:10:34,619 --> 01:10:36,488
The committee
can vote without her.

996
01:10:59,177 --> 01:11:01,146
Thank you for coming.

997
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,381
I don't think
we've formally met.

998
01:11:04,082 --> 01:11:06,217
Not formally, no.

999
01:11:10,556 --> 01:11:12,858
How can I help you,
Mr. Granger?

1000
01:11:12,993 --> 01:11:17,264
We have a mutual friend:
Andre Boxer.

1001
01:11:21,301 --> 01:11:23,336
I found him
a heart in Istanbul.

1002
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:28,240
The donor had a stroke;
he'll be dead within a month.

1003
01:11:33,212 --> 01:11:35,346
The family was planning
to donate through

1004
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:38,251
the Turkish Registry,
but they're quite destitute,

1005
01:11:38,384 --> 01:11:41,621
so I...
convinced them otherwise.

1006
01:11:45,190 --> 01:11:47,860
I made a very generous
donation to the Prime Minister,

1007
01:11:48,228 --> 01:11:49,962
so there won't be any issues.

1008
01:11:50,529 --> 01:11:54,033
Why? Why would you
do this for him?

1009
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:56,969
I'm his largest shareholder.

1010
01:12:02,408 --> 01:12:05,778
And what makes you think
that I won't go to the FBI?

1011
01:12:54,793 --> 01:12:56,762
Boxer's not answering.

1012
01:12:57,564 --> 01:12:59,298
I can't remember him
ever being late.

1013
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:00,832
Should we page him?

1014
01:13:02,835 --> 01:13:04,136
Well, speak of the devil!

1015
01:13:04,270 --> 01:13:07,407
- Where were you?
- Elevator got stuck.

1016
01:13:08,975 --> 01:13:11,444
You didn't happen to see
Father Dunbar, did you?

1017
01:13:12,011 --> 01:13:13,413
Nope.

1018
01:13:13,546 --> 01:13:16,215
That's strange.
His briefcase is here.

1019
01:13:16,615 --> 01:13:18,551
Ten minutes and counting
until skin time.

1020
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:20,853
I'll give the board
the play-by-play.

1021
01:13:20,987 --> 01:13:22,887
Marianne, please start us off.

1022
01:13:23,956 --> 01:13:29,962
I found these in Trip's
jacket pocket. Ampicillin.

1023
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:43,043
I paged Trip's GP.

1024
01:13:43,176 --> 01:13:45,211
Apparently, he's on vacation,
still no word.

1025
01:13:45,845 --> 01:13:48,114
I also spoke
to the insurance company.

1026
01:13:48,247 --> 01:13:50,248
No record,
but if you're Trip Granger,

1027
01:13:50,381 --> 01:13:52,951
do you give a shit how much
you're paying for meds?

1028
01:13:53,085 --> 01:13:54,920
Still doesn't prove he's clean.

1029
01:13:55,054 --> 01:13:56,822
Guilty until proven innocent?

1030
01:13:56,956 --> 01:13:58,356
That's not how it works.

1031
01:13:58,490 --> 01:14:00,458
What'd you get
from Holly Matson?

1032
01:14:01,193 --> 01:14:02,828
She claims
he wasn't taking drugs.

1033
01:14:02,961 --> 01:14:05,131
But she doesn't know
anything about antibiotics.

1034
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:10,270
I think... we have enough
to take a vote.

1035
01:14:10,403 --> 01:14:12,072
Trip doesn't want
to be a father.

1036
01:14:12,204 --> 01:14:14,840
Wait, he wants Holly
to have an abortion?

1037
01:14:15,573 --> 01:14:17,376
It seems that would be the case.

1038
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:19,345
Yes or no?
Elaborate, please.

1039
01:14:19,479 --> 01:14:20,780
Yes, as of last night

1040
01:14:20,912 --> 01:14:22,581
when he found out
she was pregnant.

1041
01:14:22,715 --> 01:14:25,251
What happened to her?
What did she tell you?

1042
01:14:25,384 --> 01:14:27,654
Nothing else
that would affect our decision.

1043
01:14:29,387 --> 01:14:30,957
What does that mean?

1044
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:33,659
It means that we make
our decisions based on facts,

1045
01:14:33,792 --> 01:14:36,529
including those that relate
to character.

1046
01:14:37,429 --> 01:14:39,532
There are two sides
to every story, and it would

1047
01:14:39,664 --> 01:14:42,134
be unfair to pass judgment
on Trip without letting

1048
01:14:42,268 --> 01:14:43,703
him defend himself.

1049
01:14:43,836 --> 01:14:46,539
Look at you,
growing up before our eyes.

1050
01:14:49,274 --> 01:14:50,743
Final vote.

1051
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:57,216
Curtis, Pike, or Granger.

1052
01:15:02,954 --> 01:15:04,323
Trip Granger may never be

1053
01:15:04,457 --> 01:15:06,892
Father of the Year,
but donation aside,

1054
01:15:07,025 --> 01:15:09,327
I think he's the best
of three flawed candidates.

1055
01:15:09,462 --> 01:15:12,731
I say we give Trip the heart.

1056
01:15:12,864 --> 01:15:14,501
Marianne, your vote?

1057
01:15:22,908 --> 01:15:24,477
Trip.

1058
01:15:30,748 --> 01:15:31,884
What, Allen?

1059
01:15:32,018 --> 01:15:33,319
Board will be thrilled.

1060
01:15:33,453 --> 01:15:34,821
Guess Walter Curtis
doesn't deserve

1061
01:15:34,953 --> 01:15:36,621
that Nobel Prize after all.

1062
01:15:36,756 --> 01:15:38,891
Well, what do you
care? You're not even voting!

1063
01:15:39,024 --> 01:15:40,259
Because I can't be fair!

1064
01:15:40,393 --> 01:15:42,094
Well, then, sit back
and say nothing,

1065
01:15:42,228 --> 01:15:46,097
which is what you psychiatrists
are so good at doing!

1066
01:15:46,231 --> 01:15:47,800
Just don't fool yourself
into thinking

1067
01:15:47,932 --> 01:15:50,970
that you'll sleep any better
than the rest of us.

1068
01:15:51,104 --> 01:15:52,938
Look, we all know
it's a toss-up

1069
01:15:53,072 --> 01:15:54,707
between Walter and Trip.

1070
01:15:55,742 --> 01:15:58,244
So, let's not try
to act like the donation

1071
01:15:58,377 --> 01:16:00,313
is some dirty little secret.

1072
01:16:00,445 --> 01:16:03,716
There are thousands
of Walter Curtis' out there,

1073
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:07,587
and I would love for them
to all have proper care!

1074
01:16:08,253 --> 01:16:10,788
'Least the board would be able
to finish the renovation, and I

1075
01:16:10,922 --> 01:16:14,126
wouldn't have to keep looking
at this eyesore of a hospital.

1076
01:16:43,154 --> 01:16:44,990
Dr. Taylor, where do you stand?

1077
01:16:47,126 --> 01:16:48,927
It's not a toss-up.

1078
01:16:50,563 --> 01:16:56,668
- Excuse me?
- I said... it's not a toss-up!

1079
01:16:59,738 --> 01:17:04,043
If we take into consideration
Trip's past,

1080
01:17:04,176 --> 01:17:06,011
Walter has been stable longer.

1081
01:17:06,145 --> 01:17:08,948
And we know that
he has a good support system.

1082
01:17:09,081 --> 01:17:11,317
I vote for Walter.

1083
01:17:12,717 --> 01:17:15,386
Okay,
that's two votes for Trip,

1084
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,088
one vote for Walter.

1085
01:17:17,222 --> 01:17:21,360
- Dr. Lau abstains. Boxer?
- I... I'd like to vote.

1086
01:17:24,328 --> 01:17:27,565
Are you sure, Allen? I know
it's been an emotional day...

1087
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:32,805
It has, but it's no excuse
for acting unprofessionally.

1088
01:17:32,938 --> 01:17:34,974
I've let my personal
issues get in the way

1089
01:17:35,108 --> 01:17:37,909
of something more important,
and for that, I apologize.

1090
01:17:39,944 --> 01:17:42,715
Walter Curtis
deserves this heart.

1091
01:17:44,248 --> 01:17:45,650
That's my vote.

1092
01:17:50,389 --> 01:17:53,057
Boxer, you're the decider.

1093
01:18:27,059 --> 01:18:28,761
Boxer, your vote?

1094
01:18:31,896 --> 01:18:33,332
You, Val.

1095
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:37,502
I vote for you.

1096
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:44,143
I vote for the board.

1097
01:18:44,275 --> 01:18:45,978
I vote for the 25 mil.

1098
01:18:52,083 --> 01:18:53,452
Trip gets the heart.

1099
01:19:00,591 --> 01:19:02,427
May I get to work now?

1100
01:19:04,764 --> 01:19:06,932
I still have to do
the fucking transplant.

1101
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,609
Meeting adjourned.

1102
01:19:27,418 --> 01:19:29,188
That's great news, Val!

1103
01:19:29,322 --> 01:19:32,125
I'm so glad we didn't have
to move him to Mount Sinai.

1104
01:19:33,859 --> 01:19:36,729
I assume Dr. Boxer
is doing the surgery?

1105
01:19:38,229 --> 01:19:39,931
Excellent.

1106
01:19:51,877 --> 01:19:56,480
You know, Father...
I'm... I'm not a religious man.

1107
01:19:56,614 --> 01:19:58,483
But when I heard
about that heart,

1108
01:19:59,185 --> 01:20:03,789
I couldn't help but think
that God was looking after us.

1109
01:20:10,962 --> 01:20:13,532
We can agree to disagree.

1110
01:20:44,329 --> 01:20:46,131
Jesus Christ.

1111
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:50,136
Mei fun?

1112
01:20:51,636 --> 01:20:53,672
How long have you been here?

1113
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,275
Two or three days.

1114
01:20:58,511 --> 01:21:00,145
I... I'm close.

1115
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:06,018
I'm very close. I've narrowed
it down to the sequencing.

1116
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:09,956
An error in the
anti-inflammatory sequencing.

1117
01:21:12,057 --> 01:21:14,594
Granger's plane
is waiting at Teterboro.

1118
01:21:15,327 --> 01:21:16,929
Pope's meeting us there.

1119
01:21:18,898 --> 01:21:21,634
It's too risky to rely
on the surgeons in Istanbul,

1120
01:21:21,766 --> 01:21:24,269
so they've agreed
to let me do your transplant.

1121
01:21:30,509 --> 01:21:32,109
Six months.

1122
01:21:32,243 --> 01:21:34,913
That's how long Trip lasted
before he OD'd

1123
01:21:35,046 --> 01:21:37,817
and took that 18-year-old's
heart with him...

1124
01:21:39,784 --> 01:21:43,188
Walter Curtis, Janet Pike...

1125
01:21:43,322 --> 01:21:45,024
they could've had years.

1126
01:21:45,791 --> 01:21:47,926
This organ, in Istanbul...

1127
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:50,429
somebody else
could have years with it, too.

1128
01:21:50,561 --> 01:21:52,163
Let me
ask you something:

1129
01:21:52,297 --> 01:21:54,632
if you knew that this heart
could give you six months,

1130
01:21:54,765 --> 01:21:57,568
- could you finish your work?
- I don't know.

1131
01:21:57,702 --> 01:21:59,605
Yes, you do.

1132
01:21:59,738 --> 01:22:01,873
No guarantee
I'd get six months.

1133
01:22:02,006 --> 01:22:05,876
Hell, I could die on the table,
with you operating.

1134
01:22:21,092 --> 01:22:24,029
If you don't take this organ,
we don't know where it's going.

1135
01:22:24,162 --> 01:22:26,765
There's no guarantee
it'll be put to good use.

1136
01:22:39,944 --> 01:22:43,114
You know I'll never be
a father to Hunter.

1137
01:22:43,247 --> 01:22:45,951
Even a new heart
won't change that.

1138
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,323
I know.

1139
01:22:55,659 --> 01:22:57,162
Take it, Boxer.

1140
01:22:57,296 --> 01:22:59,164
Put the committee
out of business.

1141
01:22:59,297 --> 01:23:02,132
I'd like to get back
to being a doctor.

1142
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:30,561
Scalpel.

1143
01:23:32,930 --> 01:23:35,366
Get a little more
suction there, Doctor.

1144
01:23:35,501 --> 01:23:37,369
Thank you very much.

1145
01:23:45,644 --> 01:23:46,978
Heart is out.

1146
01:24:00,125 --> 01:24:02,094
We missed you
at the meeting.

1147
01:24:05,797 --> 01:24:07,731
I see you got what you wanted.

1148
01:24:07,865 --> 01:24:09,301
Everybody wins.

1149
01:24:10,301 --> 01:24:12,837
Except Walter Curtis
and Janet Pike.

1150
01:24:12,971 --> 01:24:15,472
Yeah, well...

1151
01:24:18,344 --> 01:24:19,944
And you, Val.

1152
01:24:26,784 --> 01:24:28,720
May I have
the heart, please?

1153
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:45,903
I doubt the board gives a shit
how we got here.

1154
01:24:46,037 --> 01:24:49,807
Yeah. You're right.

1155
01:24:49,942 --> 01:24:51,877
That's why the kid's
getting the heart.

1156
01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:53,945
So what's the problem?

1157
01:24:54,078 --> 01:24:56,414
They had to cut another deal
to keep this quiet.

1158
01:24:56,547 --> 01:24:58,751
With who?

1159
01:24:59,685 --> 01:25:01,486
With me.

1160
01:25:05,556 --> 01:25:08,626
Looks like it's your
committee now, huh, Charlie?

1161
01:25:12,997 --> 01:25:15,099
Time to clean house, Val.

1162
01:25:39,625 --> 01:25:40,958
Got it?

1163
01:25:41,092 --> 01:25:43,429
Yeah. I'm good.

1164
01:25:45,162 --> 01:25:46,497
Put your leg up.

1165
01:25:47,899 --> 01:25:49,067
I gotcha.

1166
01:27:11,149 --> 01:27:13,219
I'm pregnant.

1167
01:27:19,323 --> 01:27:21,525
Been one hell of a day,
hasn't it?

1168
01:27:24,162 --> 01:27:27,900
I just...
thought you should know.

1169
01:27:28,833 --> 01:27:30,501
You keeping it?

1170
01:27:33,604 --> 01:27:35,139
I haven't decided.

1171
01:27:40,779 --> 01:27:42,147
Something tells me you have.

1172
01:28:12,176 --> 01:28:14,711
I'll support
the child financially.

1173
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:25,422
Keep your money, Boxer.

1174
01:28:45,510 --> 01:28:47,179
<i>Good morning, folks.</i>

1175
01:28:47,311 --> 01:28:49,648
<i>We have just entered
Turkish airspace.</i>

1176
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:51,983
<i>We are starting our descent
and should be landing</i>

1177
01:28:52,117 --> 01:28:53,952
<i>in about 40 minutes.</i>

1178
01:28:54,086 --> 01:28:56,621
<i>I've been informed
that Mr. Granger has arranged</i>

1179
01:28:56,755 --> 01:28:59,157
<i>ground transport
and a translator,</i>

1180
01:28:59,291 --> 01:29:01,060
<i>so you should be all set.</i>

1181
01:29:01,193 --> 01:29:04,296
<i>Just buckle your seat belts,
relax, and we'll have you</i>

1182
01:29:04,429 --> 01:29:06,498
<i>on the ground shortly.</i>

1183
01:29:16,875 --> 01:29:18,609
Boxer?

1184
01:29:20,712 --> 01:29:22,680
Boxer?

1185
01:31:00,545 --> 01:31:04,515
The nearest galaxy,
Canis Dwarf...

1186
01:31:04,649 --> 01:31:07,586
know how long
it'd take to get there?

1187
01:31:08,287 --> 01:31:11,256
I literally
have no idea.

1188
01:31:12,623 --> 01:31:15,827
900 million years
with our current tech.

1189
01:31:16,962 --> 01:31:19,897
25 thousand if you could
travel at the speed of light.

1190
01:31:24,235 --> 01:31:26,604
So, you're saying
it's possible?

1191
01:31:29,675 --> 01:31:31,009
Someday.

1192
01:31:37,716 --> 01:31:39,117
Pig heart, coming out.

1193
01:32:01,372 --> 01:32:03,407
Clamps are coming off.

1194
01:32:32,904 --> 01:32:34,706
Come on, come on.

1195
