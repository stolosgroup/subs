2
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:25,693
Oh, God.

3
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:28,032
How are you, Richard? Hot enough for you?

4
00:00:28,104 --> 00:00:29,402
Yeah.

5
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:38,109
Hey, what are you doing?

6
00:00:38,683 --> 00:00:41,584
You dummy, why don't you watch
where you are going?

7
00:01:11,453 --> 00:01:13,717
Does this look like 10:00, or like 10:30?

8
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:15,882
- Morning, Richard!
- Good morning.

9
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:18,154
- You are a half hour late.
- Only a half hour?

10
00:01:18,227 --> 00:01:21,128
I am usually 45 minutes late.
I am early today.

11
00:01:21,798 --> 00:01:22,958
I see.

12
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,138
- Are you going to join me today or what?
- Coming.

13
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,274
Give me your money and your wallets.

14
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:38,914
Get your ass out of here. It is too hot.

15
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:48,860
Color me old-fashioned, Rich,
but I just love the park on a Sunday.

16
00:01:48,928 --> 00:01:52,865
I would love it more if we didn't have
to work today. Come on, let's go.

17
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:06,337
Let me open that for you, all right?

18
00:02:34,813 --> 00:02:36,838
Hot enough for you, Larry?

19
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:39,684
No, Harris, why don't you turn up the heat?

20
00:02:39,752 --> 00:02:42,050
Okay. I'll tell the engineer.

21
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,527
Cheap bastards. Turn off
the air conditioning on the weekends.

22
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,991
- Let's go to the beach.
- No.

23
00:03:19,363 --> 00:03:22,992
- We are going to be here our whole lives.
- Yeah, I am afraid so.

24
00:03:27,306 --> 00:03:29,866
- I am going to the beach!
- Give me those papers.

25
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:32,376
- The papers are going to the beach.
- We aren't going.

26
00:03:32,444 --> 00:03:34,469
You want these?
You're coming to the beach.

27
00:03:34,546 --> 00:03:37,243
- I guess we are going to the beach.
- Wilson at the line.

28
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:41,252
That was beautiful. Replay.

29
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:45,716
Give me those papers!

30
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,192
- You think it's safe to go in the water?
- No, better not.

31
00:03:56,204 --> 00:04:00,369
- You just ate. You might get cramps.
- I'll risk it.

32
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:11,920
<i>We'll get back to you with more tunes,
but first we'll hear...</i>

33
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:14,082
<i>the latest from Weather Central.</i>

34
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:17,151
<i>- What is happening out there, buddy?
- Sizzle, sizzle...</i>

35
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:19,696
<i>as the Big Apple becomes the Baked Apple.</i>

36
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,527
<i>You better believe that these are...</i>

37
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:23,534
Oh, Christ. Will you shut that thing off?

38
00:04:23,602 --> 00:04:25,627
<i>... continues before Labor Day weekend.</i>

39
00:04:25,704 --> 00:04:30,141
<i>It is going to be the four "H's":
hot, humid, hazy, and horrible.</i>

40
00:04:32,746 --> 00:04:34,941
This sucks. I am so unhappy.

41
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:39,550
- We should be at a real beach.
- There are no more real beaches.

42
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,579
I mean we could go to Jones Beach
and float around in the hospital waste.

43
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,649
Then again Coney Island is always real nice.

44
00:04:45,726 --> 00:04:49,128
We could go there and watch the fish
disintegrate in front of our eyes.

45
00:04:49,198 --> 00:04:53,362
Wait a minute. Wait a goddamn...
Hold the phone, buddy! I got it!

46
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:56,004
I got the $2 million. Where are your pages?

47
00:04:56,072 --> 00:04:57,596
Get your pages.

48
00:04:57,674 --> 00:05:00,973
Oh, my God!
You are not going to believe what you see!

49
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:03,608
- Okay.
- Turn to Page 28.

50
00:05:06,016 --> 00:05:07,040
Right after 27.

51
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,352
- Got it.
- All right? You got it?

52
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:12,549
I want you to turn to Page 41 now.

53
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:15,917
- I got it.
- Check out line 18.

54
00:05:16,795 --> 00:05:17,819
- Okay?
- Yeah.

55
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:19,488
- You see it?
- I see it.

56
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:22,659
What about it?

57
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:26,069
You are such a stupid piece of rat shit.

58
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:27,795
Hot!

59
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:30,435
- Watch your step!
- I am being barbecued here!

60
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:34,407
All right. Okay. All right, buddy
I am going to explain it to you real slow.

61
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:35,505
- Good.
- Okay.

62
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:39,212
There's more than one check issued
on the same life insurance policy claim.

63
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:43,087
One in December of '87, another in
April of '88, and two more in June.

64
00:05:43,157 --> 00:05:45,126
- Making any sense?
- Yeah, he died four times.

65
00:05:45,194 --> 00:05:47,890
Yes. According to this, he died four times.

66
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:50,431
So somebody screwed up.
It wasn't us. Was it?

67
00:05:50,499 --> 00:05:52,468
No. It wasn't us.

68
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:55,333
Don't you see?
We just uncovered a $2 million error.

69
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:58,272
We're going to be heroes.
We're going up the corporate ladder.

70
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:00,742
- This is good for me.
- Yes, this is good for you.

71
00:06:00,811 --> 00:06:04,338
- It's good for me, too.
- I'll tell Lomax first thing in the morning.

72
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:06,610
- What page is it?
- No, Larry. Let me tell him.

73
00:06:06,684 --> 00:06:08,949
- We'll both tell him.
- Okay. Great!

74
00:06:19,565 --> 00:06:21,294
There is what's- her-name.

75
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:34,781
Stop staring at her.

76
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:36,749
You've not shut up about her
for two months.

77
00:06:36,818 --> 00:06:39,685
- Ask her out already, will you?
- No. I don't know what to say.

78
00:06:39,754 --> 00:06:41,882
She's a summer intern.
She'll be gone in a week.

79
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,152
No, I've no idea what to say.

80
00:06:43,225 --> 00:06:46,388
- Say "Hi, I want to go out with you."
- I can't say that.

81
00:06:46,862 --> 00:06:48,124
Why not?

82
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,028
Because there are too many people around.

83
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,534
It's New York City.
There are always too many people.

84
00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:54,126
Excuse me, miss.

85
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:01,410
Oh, shit.

86
00:07:04,148 --> 00:07:05,548
Good weekend, Bob?

87
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,455
- You going to say something?
- Shut up.

88
00:07:14,627 --> 00:07:16,720
- You are blowing it.
- Shut...

89
00:07:17,697 --> 00:07:19,528
Please, shut up, all right?

90
00:07:26,307 --> 00:07:27,638
Thank you.

91
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,242
Okay.

92
00:07:36,952 --> 00:07:38,545
Try witty.

93
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:41,446
Say, "You know what would look
good on you?"

94
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:45,156
- "Me." Huh?
- Oh, please.

95
00:07:45,328 --> 00:07:47,729
- Richard, that is a very good line.
- Enough, look...

96
00:07:47,798 --> 00:07:50,596
- if I wanted to talk to her, I'll talk to her.
- Talk to her.

97
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,464
- Would you talk to her?
- Would you stop?

98
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:54,433
- You want me to talk to her?
- Yes.

99
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:55,996
Okay. Shut up.

100
00:07:58,743 --> 00:08:00,074
Excuse me.

101
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:11,486
My aunt is very sick.

102
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:18,724
What?

103
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:21,896
Nothing.

104
00:08:31,613 --> 00:08:32,875
I don't believe this, she's...

105
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:35,645
Now, don't flagellate yourself
over this, Richard.

106
00:08:35,718 --> 00:08:38,209
It was a very good effort.
You'll get her next time.

107
00:08:38,288 --> 00:08:41,052
Why did I just say that?
Larry, I don't even have an aunt.

108
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:42,319
So what?

109
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,723
Anything going on?

110
00:08:44,995 --> 00:08:46,485
There are these messages.

111
00:08:46,564 --> 00:08:49,465
And you are late for
the creative sales meeting, Mr. Lomax.

112
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:52,162
- Excuse us, Mr. Lomax.
- Let me get that, sir.

113
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:53,933
Sammy. Hank. How are you?

114
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:55,336
Richard Parker, sir.

115
00:08:55,407 --> 00:08:57,102
- Larry Wilson.
- Whatever.

116
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,537
There's nothing from a Doreena,
a Martha, Judy?

117
00:08:59,612 --> 00:09:02,012
- No.
- Well, that's their tough luck.

118
00:09:02,748 --> 00:09:04,045
- Excuse us, Mr. Lomax.
- What?

119
00:09:04,117 --> 00:09:06,210
There's something
we would like to show you.

120
00:09:06,285 --> 00:09:09,619
Wait. It's Monday morning.
After lunch, right?

121
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:11,452
Quite a bit after lunch.

122
00:09:13,994 --> 00:09:14,984
Shoo.

123
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:39,155
Yeah, I got it, Franחois.

124
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,652
That's $2.

125
00:09:46,197 --> 00:09:47,290
Rich.

126
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:49,957
Look at Lomax.

127
00:09:50,068 --> 00:09:51,228
God.

128
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,595
My God. Look at her.

129
00:09:54,673 --> 00:09:55,663
My God.

130
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:58,638
Jesus. That guy.

131
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:02,307
Beautiful apartment. House at the beach.

132
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:05,380
Babes. A boat. A car.

133
00:10:05,753 --> 00:10:09,086
Do you know how much it costs
to park a car in Manhattan every month?

134
00:10:09,156 --> 00:10:12,991
- More than my rent.
- I mean, it's only fair.

135
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:16,087
His car is a bit bigger than your apartment.

136
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:18,859
So my apartment is small. It's dark.

137
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,298
It's hot. It's in a high-crime area.
Beats living with Mom and Dad.

138
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,704
All right. Enough.
It's just until I can afford something decent.

139
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:28,336
Something without
wall-to-wall cockroaches.

140
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:34,012
All I have to do is just keep
setting my goals and working hard...

141
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:35,484
- I'll be fine.
- You are so naive.

142
00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:39,316
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

143
00:10:40,058 --> 00:10:42,526
Go ahead. Oh, God.

144
00:10:42,594 --> 00:10:44,529
I hope your aunt feels better.

145
00:10:46,165 --> 00:10:47,291
- What?
- I said...

146
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:49,630
She said, "I hope your aunt feels better."

147
00:10:49,702 --> 00:10:52,797
My aunt? The sick aunt. Yes, she is fine.

148
00:10:52,872 --> 00:10:54,169
They thought it was...

149
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:56,766
Either get on the elevator or get off.

150
00:10:57,844 --> 00:10:59,038
I'll be back.

151
00:11:03,584 --> 00:11:05,882
And I lose again.

152
00:11:05,953 --> 00:11:08,821
I won. I have a date.

153
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:12,624
- You are kidding.
- No.

154
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:15,755
Gwen and I, Thursday night,
8:00 p.m., dinner.

155
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:19,131
- Fabulous.
- It was the clumsy approach. It worked.

156
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:22,060
You are going to want
to borrow my apartment.

157
00:11:22,138 --> 00:11:24,630
No, but thank you. That's sweet.

158
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,404
But I can't do that to you. Thank you.

159
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,938
If she finds out you live with your folks,
you will embarrass yourself.

160
00:11:32,017 --> 00:11:34,577
Yeah, I know, but I can't do that to you.

161
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,717
It is the cockroaches, isn't it?

162
00:11:41,427 --> 00:11:43,952
- Well...
- They scatter when the lights go on.

163
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:48,491
<i>Mr. Parker, Mr. Lomax will see you now.</i>

164
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:49,997
I feel lucky.

165
00:11:53,173 --> 00:11:56,439
No, I only want the Maserati
if it comes in that jet black.

166
00:11:58,446 --> 00:11:59,936
Look, if you can't do it for me...

167
00:12:00,014 --> 00:12:02,983
I'll just have to take my business
to another dealer.

168
00:12:03,451 --> 00:12:04,544
Yeah.

169
00:12:05,421 --> 00:12:08,356
So paint it! I mean how hard
can this whole thing be?

170
00:12:08,424 --> 00:12:09,584
Right.

171
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:12,561
All right. See, that's better.

172
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:15,427
See how easy it is to do business with me?

173
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:20,333
No trade. Strictly cash.

174
00:12:20,571 --> 00:12:21,902
Right.

175
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,105
All right. Good.

176
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:33,511
Gentlemen, what have you got for me?

177
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:39,119
As you may or may not know, Mr. Lomax...

178
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:43,322
Larry and I have been, I mean, working.

179
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:46,093
- Where is he going?
- I don't know.

180
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,135
What are we supposed to do?

181
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:53,066
Bet that thing moves, huh? Jesus.

182
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:55,701
- Put that back.
- It's a beautiful boat.

183
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:07,713
You gentlemen were saying...

184
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,984
Yes, well.

185
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:10,959
As you might have heard...

186
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:15,858
Larry and I have been reprogramming
the accounts on the new computer system.

187
00:13:15,932 --> 00:13:17,560
- Right.
- Thanks.

188
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,697
Sir, it's a very big job.

189
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:23,070
A big job. We have been working hard.

190
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:24,165
A very big job.

191
00:13:24,242 --> 00:13:26,541
I've been at it for quite some time.
Weekends also.

192
00:13:26,612 --> 00:13:28,705
- Weekends, late, and...
- Why don't you show him?

193
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:29,770
Thank you.

194
00:13:29,848 --> 00:13:31,713
We've got something
you should know about.

195
00:13:31,784 --> 00:13:34,379
- Got them both there?
- Yes. Page 28 and 41.

196
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,200
You sure these figures are accurate?

197
00:13:48,602 --> 00:13:50,002
- Yes.
- Positive.

198
00:13:50,071 --> 00:13:51,766
Yes, sir, Mr. Lomax.

199
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,570
Bernie.

200
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:01,540
Call me Bernie.

201
00:14:03,152 --> 00:14:05,416
I mean my father is Mr. Lomax, right?

202
00:14:14,332 --> 00:14:16,095
Okay, Bernie.

203
00:14:16,534 --> 00:14:20,971
- Yes, it's all there in black and white.
- We both worked on this one, Bern.

204
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:22,830
"E."

205
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:24,807
Bernie.

206
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:29,275
- Papers.
- Right here, Bernie.

207
00:14:30,517 --> 00:14:32,747
If anything has to go,
I am glad it's my vision...

208
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:35,879
and not the old joystick,
you know what I mean?

209
00:14:40,161 --> 00:14:42,186
That's computer ink, sir.

210
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:48,630
Oh, no, you are wrong. Look.

211
00:14:49,137 --> 00:14:53,301
There are multiple checks issued
because there were several policies written.

212
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,936
You didn't take into consideration
that it's normal...

213
00:14:56,012 --> 00:14:59,004
especially when using
a fluctuating COL index to combine...

214
00:14:59,082 --> 00:15:02,951
look here, a package containing
short-term and straight life policies...

215
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,885
in an overall insurance portfolio.

216
00:15:04,955 --> 00:15:07,082
Now you are wasting my time.

217
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,430
Richard worked on that part, sir.

218
00:15:15,534 --> 00:15:18,025
That is true, Bernie.

219
00:15:18,604 --> 00:15:22,870
But if you were to look at the back page,
where the policy indexes are...

220
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:25,307
you'll notice that the remaining policies...

221
00:15:25,378 --> 00:15:29,509
are dated after
the policy holder died, Bernie.

222
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,745
You are right.

223
00:15:35,256 --> 00:15:37,884
You are absolutely right.
Gentlemen, this is good work.

224
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:39,620
Very, very good work.

225
00:15:39,694 --> 00:15:41,286
Thank you, Bernie.

226
00:15:41,362 --> 00:15:44,298
I hate to say this, but it appears
as if somebody is trying...

227
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:47,199
to defraud the company.
Perhaps we should check back records.

228
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:49,863
Somebody tried to smoke it
past the wrong guy.

229
00:15:50,573 --> 00:15:51,939
No smoking.

230
00:15:52,342 --> 00:15:55,334
Gentlemen, how long have you two
been working here?

231
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,812
- Nineteen months and a week.
- I am not really sure.

232
00:15:57,881 --> 00:16:00,578
- A little longer, I think.
- Longer? I was here before you.

233
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:01,948
No, Richard. I trained you.

234
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:04,886
I came here in January,
you came the end of May.

235
00:16:04,956 --> 00:16:06,514
I trained you.

236
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:07,854
Whatever!

237
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:11,728
What I am saying is that
I think there is a big future here...

238
00:16:11,797 --> 00:16:14,493
for a couple of bright fellows
like yourselves.

239
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:16,327
Thank you.

240
00:16:16,402 --> 00:16:18,632
But I'd like to go over these numbers
with you...

241
00:16:18,705 --> 00:16:21,037
just to make sure
that you've gotten everything.

242
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:24,134
The only trouble is if someone is trying to...

243
00:16:24,478 --> 00:16:26,673
like you said
"smoke it past the wrong guy"...

244
00:16:26,747 --> 00:16:28,977
I'd like to just keep it confidential.

245
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:31,678
I mean there is no sense sending up
a bunch of red flags.

246
00:16:31,753 --> 00:16:32,913
No, absolutely not.

247
00:16:32,988 --> 00:16:34,853
If you would like, we'll work late.

248
00:16:34,923 --> 00:16:38,188
- Yes, I mean we'll work weekends.
- Weekends are very good for me.

249
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:40,660
Weekends. Good idea.

250
00:16:41,063 --> 00:16:43,861
Give us plenty of time together,
no distractions.

251
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,592
It is Labor Day.

252
00:16:49,272 --> 00:16:50,762
I got an idea.

253
00:16:53,343 --> 00:16:56,939
How would you two like to come
to my house at the beach?

254
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,311
- Me?
- Us?

255
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:02,080
Yeah. Hampton Island.

256
00:17:02,153 --> 00:17:04,850
Ever been there? Well, you will love it.

257
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,153
When we're not working,
there are distractions.

258
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:10,059
There are women, swimming,
boating, famous people.

259
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,664
Well?

260
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:15,758
- Love to!
- Okay.

261
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:17,632
Good! It's settled.

262
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:21,241
We are going to have a good time,
I guarantee.

263
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:23,299
My secretary will write down
the directions...

264
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,641
- give you the ferry schedule.
- The ferry schedule?

265
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:29,013
It's the only way to get there,
unless you have a boat. I don't know.

266
00:17:29,084 --> 00:17:30,847
I have never even been on a boat.

267
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:33,319
I was once on the Staten Island Ferry
with my folks...

268
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:37,189
Whatever. You come out Friday night,
you'll have a great time, I guarantee it.

269
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,252
I'll even drive you back to the city myself
on Monday. Okay?

270
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:42,456
We don't know what to say, Bernie.

271
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:45,395
You don't have to say anything.

272
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:48,402
If you two uncovered what I think
you uncovered...

273
00:17:48,739 --> 00:17:52,198
old Bernie here owes you both a great deal.
I mean it sincerely.

274
00:17:52,277 --> 00:17:54,472
Now get out of here. Go on.

275
00:17:59,451 --> 00:18:00,885
He loves us.

276
00:18:01,187 --> 00:18:05,123
The man absolutely loves us.

277
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:08,727
You have to kill them, Vito.

278
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,538
Let me explain something to you.

279
00:18:23,277 --> 00:18:27,078
We don't do that anymore.
We are a corporation now.

280
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:30,450
We are in the market. We invest.

281
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:34,286
Real estate. Car rentals. Parking lots.

282
00:18:35,658 --> 00:18:37,922
Parking lots. That's good.

283
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:41,530
- I understand that, but...
- Didn't I order the walnut dressing?

284
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:43,965
- Yes, you did.
- Taste that.

285
00:18:45,603 --> 00:18:48,663
Does that taste
anything like walnut dressing? Tell me.

286
00:18:49,407 --> 00:18:51,705
This is the raspberry vinaigrette.

287
00:18:52,511 --> 00:18:55,207
Should I have Paulie go
and talk to the chef?

288
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,311
This goddamn raspberry vinaigrette...

289
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:07,051
Excuse me, Vito.

290
00:19:15,503 --> 00:19:18,199
I know how important food is to you,
I mean...

291
00:19:19,507 --> 00:19:21,408
But we've got a problem here.

292
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,769
I give problems. I don't get problems.

293
00:19:30,153 --> 00:19:32,485
How do you propose to handle it?

294
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:38,620
Let's make it a murder-suicide job. All right?

295
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:40,628
Okay, gentlemen?

296
00:19:41,032 --> 00:19:44,468
I'll plant some money, fake a note,
and they can take the rap and...

297
00:19:44,535 --> 00:19:47,334
I won't even have to change the books.

298
00:19:49,675 --> 00:19:51,336
What do you think?

299
00:19:55,415 --> 00:19:57,747
I like it. It's creative.

300
00:20:01,487 --> 00:20:04,218
I am a little rusty. But it'll come back to me.

301
00:20:10,298 --> 00:20:11,424
Okay.

302
00:20:14,135 --> 00:20:16,763
- Do it.
- This is good.

303
00:20:16,872 --> 00:20:19,433
I mean this is really good. Good.

304
00:20:21,544 --> 00:20:25,002
I think we are going to have some fun.

305
00:20:29,653 --> 00:20:32,918
- I have to get going. I really do.
- What, no dessert?

306
00:20:33,457 --> 00:20:36,484
They do a wonderful crטme brlיe here.
It's delicious.

307
00:20:36,761 --> 00:20:40,322
No, gentlemen, I really must be going.
Thanks for dinner, Vito.

308
00:20:47,006 --> 00:20:49,167
I got to go powder my nose.

309
00:21:05,893 --> 00:21:08,192
Forget the accident with the two guys.

310
00:21:08,463 --> 00:21:09,691
Take care of Lomax.

311
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:12,627
He's getting too careless...

312
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:15,396
too greedy.

313
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:19,806
Besides...

314
00:21:21,177 --> 00:21:23,169
he's screwing my girlfriend.

315
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:29,250
But you said we were going to
spend the weekend at the beach!

316
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,222
You heard the conversation.
What am I supposed to do about it?

317
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,279
- Bernie.
- What?

318
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:36,987
I told Vito I was going to spend
some time with my mother!

319
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,600
I have to see you, Bernie.

320
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,034
Cut it out.

321
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:51,542
- What's wrong with you? Wait a minute.
- What?

322
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:53,511
- I have an idea.
- What?

323
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,573
You are on, 9:00 Friday night.
I'll be at the apartment.

324
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:58,551
Just use your key. All right?

325
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,515
I'll wear something special.

326
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:04,890
I bet you never had sweet and sour
matzo balls before.

327
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,984
No.

328
00:22:08,831 --> 00:22:11,699
- I am glad you finally asked me out.
- You are?

329
00:22:13,003 --> 00:22:15,164
I wish you had asked me out sooner.

330
00:22:15,372 --> 00:22:18,603
Today was my last day at work.
I am going back to college.

331
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,874
We could still have
this weekend together, right?

332
00:22:21,946 --> 00:22:23,914
I am spending it with my folks.

333
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:26,415
- Are your folks in town?
- No.

334
00:22:30,188 --> 00:22:33,783
Is this the intimate evening
I promised you, or what?

335
00:22:34,493 --> 00:22:37,395
You think there's anywhere we could go
to just sit and talk...

336
00:22:37,463 --> 00:22:40,728
and not have to scream
and get run over by garbage trucks?

337
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,700
- Hey, want to throw her in?
- How you doing?

338
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:45,933
I'd invite you to my apartment,
but I have five roommates.

339
00:22:46,006 --> 00:22:48,372
And they are all at home
doing their hair right now.

340
00:22:48,442 --> 00:22:52,436
That's a lot of hair. But it's clean. I like that.

341
00:22:53,048 --> 00:22:56,984
It's either that or living with my parents,
and I don't think that's a good idea.

342
00:22:57,052 --> 00:23:00,489
I can't blame you. Who'd want
to live with their folks? That's no good.

343
00:23:00,556 --> 00:23:03,616
- Do you have any roommates?
- No. Roommates? No. None.

344
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:05,449
Why don't we go to your place?

345
00:23:05,528 --> 00:23:09,124
Come on, baby. You're not a woman.
Are you? Tell me the truth.

346
00:23:14,871 --> 00:23:16,134
Okay.

347
00:23:31,223 --> 00:23:33,124
Why are you tiptoeing?

348
00:23:34,627 --> 00:23:35,958
Because...

349
00:23:39,265 --> 00:23:42,929
the people who live downstairs,
they're very light sleepers.

350
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:46,538
They get angry when I walk.

351
00:23:47,775 --> 00:23:49,676
Why are you whispering?

352
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,806
- Am I?
- Yes.

353
00:23:53,381 --> 00:23:57,716
I am. That's because of the walls.
They are too thin.

354
00:23:58,721 --> 00:24:02,350
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

355
00:24:14,973 --> 00:24:18,932
Look at this teak.
I mean this whole apartment.

356
00:24:19,444 --> 00:24:21,675
Sort of '60s style.

357
00:24:21,747 --> 00:24:24,739
Yeah. I know.
I've been meaning to redo that for years.

358
00:24:24,817 --> 00:24:27,911
No, I love it. I mean, it's very hip.

359
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:31,587
I think you have done the place beautifully.

360
00:24:31,658 --> 00:24:33,888
I like it. It's home.

361
00:24:33,994 --> 00:24:36,896
You know, it's a side of you
I never would have expected.

362
00:24:36,964 --> 00:24:38,522
I'm very impressed.

363
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,226
- Are you?
- Yeah.

364
00:24:41,335 --> 00:24:42,700
About what?

365
00:24:43,104 --> 00:24:45,903
This apartment has got to be expensive.

366
00:24:45,974 --> 00:24:50,343
So obviously you could have taken me
to some flash restaurant instead of that...

367
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,906
Is "dump" the word you are groping for?

368
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:56,510
You didn't like Hymie's Hunan?

369
00:24:57,086 --> 00:25:00,214
- It's a four-star dive.
- It was great. I loved it.

370
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,658
It's just that some men
would try to impress women by...

371
00:25:03,727 --> 00:25:05,854
pretending to be something they are not.

372
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:09,423
I absolutely agree. That's a terrible way
to begin a relationship.

373
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:12,265
Pretending to be something you are not.

374
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,632
Oh, God.

375
00:25:13,872 --> 00:25:16,841
You don't have to answer this
if you don't want to...

376
00:25:16,908 --> 00:25:19,605
but how do you afford a place like this?

377
00:25:21,814 --> 00:25:24,009
I don't like to brag.

378
00:25:24,183 --> 00:25:27,347
I just feel uncomfortable
showing off my money...

379
00:25:27,421 --> 00:25:31,585
but I've made some wise investments.
I dabble in the stock market.

380
00:25:31,825 --> 00:25:35,956
And of course my parents
were rather well off.

381
00:25:36,598 --> 00:25:38,327
Do you want to sit?

382
00:25:41,403 --> 00:25:43,030
They passed away?

383
00:25:44,106 --> 00:25:45,164
Yes.

384
00:25:45,341 --> 00:25:47,366
They must have been young.

385
00:25:48,177 --> 00:25:49,440
Oh, yeah.

386
00:25:52,215 --> 00:25:54,809
I feel I can trust you.

387
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,051
They were in a train accident.

388
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,724
Yeah, I mean I don't know
what it was with trains...

389
00:26:01,792 --> 00:26:05,387
but they just always liked to travel in trains.

390
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,763
I am sorry.

391
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,995
- How awful for you.
- Yeah.

392
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:17,535
You know, I always thought trains
were so much safer than planes.

393
00:26:18,144 --> 00:26:21,477
Well, actually, a plane...

394
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:24,380
fell on the train.

395
00:26:50,247 --> 00:26:51,771
- Richard.
- Gwen.

396
00:26:54,252 --> 00:26:58,086
There's a man in his underwear
in your kitchen.

397
00:26:59,023 --> 00:27:00,923
He's... He's with me.

398
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:06,227
He's my butler. But...

399
00:27:06,832 --> 00:27:09,426
- You have a butler?
- Yeah. Don't get him started.

400
00:27:09,501 --> 00:27:12,835
He'll just go away if you just be quiet.

401
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:26,950
Sorry. I didn't realize you had company.

402
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:28,717
Good evening, young lady.

403
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,815
That's all right, Monroe.

404
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:38,125
Yes, will you, please, just go lay out
my navy blue suit for the morning?

405
00:27:38,201 --> 00:27:39,259
Please.

406
00:27:39,335 --> 00:27:41,701
- How about if I lay you out?
- Very well.

407
00:27:46,643 --> 00:27:50,079
- You let your butler talk to you like that?
- Well, he is a vet.

408
00:27:50,147 --> 00:27:52,412
He has got a steel plate in his head.

409
00:27:54,352 --> 00:27:56,684
Gwen, it's not what you think.

410
00:27:57,188 --> 00:27:58,884
Goodbye, Richard.

411
00:28:26,021 --> 00:28:27,045
I'll grab the bow line.

412
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,216
- Hey, Skeet. How are you doing?
- Hey, Mr. Lomax.

413
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:33,160
Here you go, my friend.
Buy yourself a girlfriend.

414
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,063
Where have you been, Candy?

415
00:28:40,037 --> 00:28:43,006
- Hey, Bernie. How about a drink?
- A little bit later.

416
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,544
- Yo, Bernie. The cocktail flag is up.
- A little bit later.

417
00:28:49,614 --> 00:28:52,378
Booze and women.
That is my lifestyle and I love it!

418
00:28:52,451 --> 00:28:53,748
And I!

419
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,158
- George, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mr. Lomax.

420
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:38,662
What are you doing here?
I fired you last week.

421
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:40,294
- I just want my $90, okay?
- Bullshit!

422
00:29:40,371 --> 00:29:42,737
You drank my liquor
and the toilets still don't work.

423
00:29:42,807 --> 00:29:44,639
I don't want to see you.

424
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,275
Get out of here!

425
00:29:46,945 --> 00:29:49,311
You come back again,
I am going to call the cops!

426
00:29:49,381 --> 00:29:51,144
You son of a bitch.

427
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:00,959
- I am sorry. I think she needs a little B-12.
- Whatever.

428
00:30:01,028 --> 00:30:03,861
<i>This is Bernie. Leave a message,
I'll get right back to you.</i>

429
00:30:03,931 --> 00:30:05,922
- Goodbye, Mr. Lomax.
- Bye.

430
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,558
Hello?

431
00:30:08,068 --> 00:30:11,334
Hey, Lomax. It's Paulie.
I just got to the island.

432
00:30:11,706 --> 00:30:12,764
You are early.

433
00:30:12,841 --> 00:30:15,207
Those schmucks are not coming
until the 6:00 ferry...

434
00:30:15,277 --> 00:30:17,769
- and I still have to plant the note.
- Yeah.

435
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,142
So where is your house?

436
00:30:19,215 --> 00:30:21,274
It's on the point, top of the dune.

437
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:24,183
Look, Paulie,
don't kill them while I am around.

438
00:30:24,253 --> 00:30:26,347
Bernie, we are on a phone here.

439
00:30:26,423 --> 00:30:28,220
Right. You are right. Okay, I am sorry.

440
00:30:28,292 --> 00:30:31,591
The point is, I just want to be
back in New York with an alibi, okay?

441
00:30:31,662 --> 00:30:33,688
Yeah. Don't worry about it.

442
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:46,267
Oh, God!

443
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:49,740
Rich. It is leaving. Come on!

444
00:30:49,816 --> 00:30:52,284
I told you we should've taken
a taxi from the station.

445
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:55,287
- There's another boat in a half hour.
- We'll miss the parties.

446
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:57,324
We got it. Excuse me.

447
00:30:57,391 --> 00:30:59,689
- Sorry.
- Coming through.

448
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,218
Don't be ridiculous! What are you doing?
We are not jumping on this boat!

449
00:31:03,297 --> 00:31:04,662
- Do you hear me?
- Here we go!

450
00:31:04,732 --> 00:31:07,793
Listen to me, Larry, we are not
jumping on this boat!

451
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:10,235
- Jesus Christ! My elbow!
- Piece of cake!

452
00:31:12,641 --> 00:31:14,166
Thanks, pal.

453
00:31:16,879 --> 00:31:20,178
This ferry isn't leaving. It's docking.

454
00:31:21,518 --> 00:31:23,611
- Okay. We're early.
- You schmuck.

455
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:44,935
- What is your name?
- What is your name?

456
00:31:45,044 --> 00:31:47,138
- Larry.
- Hi, Larry. I am Michelle.

457
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:50,712
Come on! Lighten up there, Rich!
We are on our way!

458
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:54,482
I am so depressed.
I made a fool out of myself last night.

459
00:31:54,555 --> 00:31:55,647
Of course you did.

460
00:31:55,723 --> 00:31:58,214
- I should've stayed home.
- What are you talking about?

461
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:01,854
We've been summoned to the mountain top.
This is good for your career.

462
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:05,866
You know, by the time this weekend is over,
I promise you won't even remember...

463
00:32:05,934 --> 00:32:08,960
what's- her-name's name.
I'll get you a drink. Come on.

464
00:32:09,071 --> 00:32:11,165
Look, I'll see you later.

465
00:32:11,274 --> 00:32:13,742
Goodbye, young man. Nice talking to you.

466
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:29,323
That is good. This is very good.

467
00:32:35,601 --> 00:32:37,899
- I did not hear you come in.
- I know.

468
00:32:38,738 --> 00:32:40,103
I am real good at that.

469
00:32:40,173 --> 00:32:42,768
- I told you the guys aren't here yet, didn't I?
- You did.

470
00:32:42,843 --> 00:32:44,606
- Good.
- Quite a shack you have here.

471
00:32:44,678 --> 00:32:46,111
It's home.

472
00:32:47,414 --> 00:32:49,041
Can I have a cigarette?

473
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:51,977
Cigarette.

474
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,382
Sure.

475
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:01,656
What was...

476
00:33:11,308 --> 00:33:13,333
Quite a ride, huh, Bern?

477
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,332
Glorious day out, or what?

478
00:33:39,406 --> 00:33:40,873
Where's Bernie?

479
00:33:40,941 --> 00:33:45,207
I got it right here. It says it's the last house
on the point, top of the dune.

480
00:33:46,313 --> 00:33:49,875
Pardon me, Monsignor, sir, could you
tell me where the top of the dune is?

481
00:33:49,951 --> 00:33:53,478
- Bless you, my son.
- Thank you, Father.

482
00:33:53,789 --> 00:33:55,951
Look, we'll find it. Okay.

483
00:33:56,626 --> 00:33:59,424
- You know, it's an island, right?
- How hard can it be?

484
00:34:00,763 --> 00:34:02,857
Excuse me. Is this the way to...

485
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:21,282
- Yo, is this Bernie Lomax's house?
- Sure is.

486
00:34:21,787 --> 00:34:22,947
Wow.

487
00:34:23,022 --> 00:34:25,786
Holy shit. Look at this.

488
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,850
Come on, Rich.

489
00:34:31,598 --> 00:34:33,088
Oh, beautiful.

490
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,396
Oh, my God. He has got a pool.

491
00:34:35,636 --> 00:34:38,628
He has got a goddamn pool at the beach.
It's heated.

492
00:34:38,706 --> 00:34:40,037
I love this man.

493
00:34:40,975 --> 00:34:43,706
This is inspiring. Look at this view.

494
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:47,110
- I am getting laid.
- Sure beats Coney Island.

495
00:34:53,156 --> 00:34:55,351
What? Should we just walk in?

496
00:34:56,726 --> 00:35:00,959
No, we'll stand out here all weekend.
Come on, we are houseguests.

497
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,966
Hello! Bernie, we are here.

498
00:35:05,502 --> 00:35:06,730
Amazing.

499
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:11,839
I am home.

500
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,275
Excellent.

501
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:19,208
- Admit it. You are glad you came.
- Okay, I admit it.

502
00:35:20,052 --> 00:35:23,488
- We got three days of this ahead of us.
- Oh, yeah. This is something.

503
00:35:23,556 --> 00:35:27,891
I mean a place like this must go for what,
a $1.6 million, $1.7 million. Unfurnished.

504
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:31,089
- Good God! That's a Lichtenstein!
- What? Where?

505
00:35:31,164 --> 00:35:33,531
Not the piano. The painting. It's an original.

506
00:35:33,601 --> 00:35:35,228
Of course it is.

507
00:35:35,303 --> 00:35:38,534
All of this could be yours,
if you set your goals and work hard.

508
00:35:38,606 --> 00:35:41,906
My old man worked hard.
All they did was give him more work.

509
00:35:44,713 --> 00:35:46,510
Hey, is Bernie around?

510
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:50,818
Hello. No, haven't seen him.
But we just got here.

511
00:35:50,887 --> 00:35:53,378
We're going to be here all weekend.
We are houseguests.

512
00:35:53,456 --> 00:35:55,754
Tell him Tawny borrowed his boat
to go skiing.

513
00:35:55,825 --> 00:35:57,691
Hi, Tawny. I am horny.

514
00:35:57,762 --> 00:36:01,960
- Hi. Look, don't forget to tell Bernie, okay?
- Okay.

515
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:05,762
Tawny, you wouldn't happen to know
where Bernie is, would you?

516
00:36:05,837 --> 00:36:07,202
He's probably making the rounds.

517
00:36:07,272 --> 00:36:11,208
Everybody parties from house to house,
but they always end up here. Bye!

518
00:36:11,843 --> 00:36:15,644
- And you didn't want to come.
- I admit it, I was wrong.

519
00:36:18,518 --> 00:36:20,510
Oh, my God.

520
00:36:21,488 --> 00:36:25,948
Nothing but champagne and caviar.
Pierre Jouכt.

521
00:36:26,026 --> 00:36:27,789
This guy is my idol.

522
00:36:27,861 --> 00:36:29,693
- Don't open that.
- Why not?

523
00:36:29,764 --> 00:36:31,857
We are houseguests, come on.
You want some?

524
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:34,925
No, thanks. This is strange.
Where's our host?

525
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:38,133
You heard Tawny. He's out partying.
Come on.

526
00:36:38,207 --> 00:36:40,869
Let's check out the rest of this joint.

527
00:36:41,444 --> 00:36:42,536
This is fabulous.

528
00:36:48,118 --> 00:36:51,053
I found him. Mr. Lomax.

529
00:36:51,355 --> 00:36:53,085
Bernie! How are you doing? Great place.

530
00:36:53,157 --> 00:36:56,649
I hope you don't mind, but we just
walked in. We didn't know that you...

531
00:36:56,728 --> 00:36:57,922
Bernie?

532
00:36:58,863 --> 00:37:00,262
He's sleeping.

533
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:04,230
Yeah.

534
00:37:06,305 --> 00:37:08,637
It's not even dark out
and he's out of his skull.

535
00:37:08,707 --> 00:37:11,176
He's been working awfully hard, you know.

536
00:37:13,947 --> 00:37:16,507
Don't slap him. That's your boss.

537
00:37:17,218 --> 00:37:19,618
I know. He's meditating.

538
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,689
He's not. He's like dead, man.
Come on, let's walk him around.

539
00:37:22,757 --> 00:37:24,588
We'll get the blood circulating.

540
00:37:24,658 --> 00:37:26,718
There we go. Okay, this way.

541
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,495
Here we go.

542
00:37:30,532 --> 00:37:32,932
That's it. Move those feet, Bernie.
That's a boy.

543
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,129
- Here you go.
- Get him up.

544
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:37,236
Carry your weight, here, Richard.

545
00:37:37,306 --> 00:37:38,568
Come on, Bernie.

546
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:41,132
- Move those feet.
- He's giving me a hernia.

547
00:37:41,612 --> 00:37:44,638
I am losing him. Put him on the couch.

548
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:54,247
- We can't just leave him like this, you know.
- Come on, Bernie.

549
00:37:58,931 --> 00:38:01,161
Get your hand off me, Bernie.

550
00:38:03,836 --> 00:38:05,600
I'll make the coffee.

551
00:38:12,646 --> 00:38:16,515
Don't you worry, Mr. Lomax, we'll make
you some coffee, fix you right up.

552
00:38:19,087 --> 00:38:21,578
Tell you what, let's just make you
a little more comfy.

553
00:38:21,656 --> 00:38:23,784
That is better. There you go.

554
00:38:24,226 --> 00:38:27,662
You are dropping things
right out of your pocket here.

555
00:38:34,204 --> 00:38:36,638
You want to come in here for a minute?

556
00:38:36,706 --> 00:38:39,335
- Yeah, look, Rich, is instant okay?
- That's fine.

557
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:42,038
- Good. What?
- Look what I found in his pocket.

558
00:38:45,082 --> 00:38:46,345
Wow.

559
00:38:47,285 --> 00:38:48,445
Jesus.

560
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:51,851
I never knew he was into the drug scene.

561
00:38:53,158 --> 00:38:54,956
God. Look how much is here.

562
00:38:55,027 --> 00:38:57,996
This is not recreational. This is a career.

563
00:38:58,397 --> 00:39:00,262
This man needs some help. You know that?

564
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:02,564
If he's not careful,
he's going to wake up dead.

565
00:39:02,636 --> 00:39:05,537
<i>I watch 20/20. I know the statistics.</i>

566
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,434
I read.

567
00:39:09,476 --> 00:39:11,809
- What?
- Larry, Lomax is dead.

568
00:39:19,255 --> 00:39:20,882
He can't be.

569
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:36,368
Why do these things always happen to me?

570
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:43,608
What kind of a host invites you to his house
for the weekend and dies on you?

571
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:48,183
Why would he do this?
I mean, he had everything.

572
00:39:48,654 --> 00:39:51,283
A house. Cars. Women.

573
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:53,916
This is tragic.

574
00:39:54,627 --> 00:39:59,031
I don't understand why he couldn't wait
until Monday to kill himself.

575
00:40:00,367 --> 00:40:02,892
Look. We have to call the police.

576
00:40:03,103 --> 00:40:07,165
And how am I going to get back to the city?
He promised me a ride.

577
00:40:07,442 --> 00:40:11,538
Knock it off, Larry. Who cares about a ride?
We are talking death here.

578
00:40:13,348 --> 00:40:15,146
I mean this is just my luck.

579
00:40:15,618 --> 00:40:17,518
I finally catch a break at the office...

580
00:40:17,587 --> 00:40:20,715
finally see some light
at the end of the tunnel and wham! Gone!

581
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,783
Wait a minute. What am I going to tell them?

582
00:40:23,894 --> 00:40:26,158
They might think
we had something to do with it.

583
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:29,256
I told everyone we were going
to Bernie's house for the weekend.

584
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:31,734
They were so jealous. I mean, I loved it.

585
00:40:32,537 --> 00:40:35,734
- Now what am I going to tell them?
- I don't know.

586
00:40:39,143 --> 00:40:41,169
Bernie, you should have been on the court.

587
00:40:42,014 --> 00:40:43,879
- What a great day.
- Do you see him?

588
00:40:43,949 --> 00:40:45,177
Where are you?

589
00:40:52,525 --> 00:40:56,758
Bernie, baby, get off your ass.
It's party time!

590
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:59,932
You should have been out there
sailing with us today.

591
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:03,027
The sun was fabulous, the wind was
fabulous, we had a great time.

592
00:41:03,104 --> 00:41:04,800
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

593
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,341
Love you, darling, just love you.
You know, you could use a little sun.

594
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,469
We are going again tomorrow
if you want to go.

595
00:41:10,545 --> 00:41:14,277
Lie on the deck, catch those rays.
Don't worry. I'll help myself.

596
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:17,516
He's dead.

597
00:41:18,688 --> 00:41:20,987
That's the idea, isn't it? Cheers.

598
00:41:22,326 --> 00:41:23,588
Hi, Bern!

599
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:25,794
Hey, Bernie.

600
00:41:31,603 --> 00:41:32,729
Hi, Bernie.

601
00:41:34,606 --> 00:41:36,871
Hey, dude. You need to pump some iron.

602
00:41:39,445 --> 00:41:41,140
So, Bernie. What about your Porsche?

603
00:41:41,213 --> 00:41:42,874
Had a chance to think about my offer?

604
00:41:42,948 --> 00:41:46,646
You know, $30,000 is a more than
decent price for that car.

605
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:51,790
You just think about it, take your time,
don't rush into anything. See you later.

606
00:41:57,065 --> 00:41:58,089
Excuse me.

607
00:41:58,166 --> 00:41:59,292
You promised me a review...

608
00:41:59,367 --> 00:42:01,632
<i>on the front page
of the Sunday Times book section.</i>

609
00:42:01,704 --> 00:42:03,433
I know, Alice, but he won't bend on it.

610
00:42:03,505 --> 00:42:05,837
He says there's no interest
in the subject matter.

611
00:42:05,908 --> 00:42:08,001
Pardon me. What's the book about?

612
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:11,138
Whether Sherlock Holmes
and Dr. Watson were secretly married.

613
00:42:11,214 --> 00:42:13,182
- Eyes, nose, and breasts.
- How much?

614
00:42:13,249 --> 00:42:16,013
A little tuck here, little sand there,
a little lift there.

615
00:42:16,086 --> 00:42:17,349
Do I need that much?

616
00:42:17,421 --> 00:42:20,185
These people.
Where did all these people come from?

617
00:42:20,257 --> 00:42:22,623
Floating party. Happens every weekend.

618
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,786
- Like a drink?
- No, thanks.

619
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:27,228
Yeah, I'd love some champagne, thanks.

620
00:42:27,332 --> 00:42:29,800
Hey, Bernie. What a radical party.

621
00:42:30,569 --> 00:42:33,266
Got to move your workout
to late tomorrow afternoon, B.

622
00:42:33,339 --> 00:42:37,503
Liza's maid is over for the weekend,
and I had to give her your regular time.

623
00:42:38,544 --> 00:42:40,307
Thanks, Klaus. I got it.

624
00:42:40,581 --> 00:42:41,912
See you, Bern.

625
00:42:44,451 --> 00:42:47,318
Feels good, eh, Bern? You are really loose.

626
00:42:47,521 --> 00:42:50,582
Never seen you this relaxed before.
Keep it up.

627
00:42:50,658 --> 00:42:52,455
I've got to go. Duty calls.

628
00:42:53,528 --> 00:42:55,291
Hey, babe.

629
00:42:55,363 --> 00:42:58,629
Hi, Bernie. I hear you got something for me.

630
00:42:58,901 --> 00:43:00,528
A little present.

631
00:43:02,104 --> 00:43:04,004
Playing games, are we?

632
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,201
It's got to be in here somewhere.

633
00:43:08,779 --> 00:43:10,906
I think I found something.

634
00:43:12,516 --> 00:43:14,314
Thanks a lot, Bernie.

635
00:43:18,923 --> 00:43:21,552
Doesn't anyone realize he's dead?

636
00:43:24,129 --> 00:43:26,154
Okay, Bernie, I'm going to shoot the wad.

637
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:29,565
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I am going to go $40,000.

638
00:43:30,236 --> 00:43:32,329
No? You'll be begging me.

639
00:43:34,507 --> 00:43:36,270
We have to call the police.

640
00:43:37,945 --> 00:43:39,105
Here.

641
00:43:40,247 --> 00:43:42,613
- Some of the biggest producers.
- Yeah?

642
00:43:52,594 --> 00:43:54,927
Hello, is this the police? Yes...

643
00:43:54,997 --> 00:43:57,158
I got an idea.

644
00:43:57,266 --> 00:44:00,099
I know it's going to sound funny,
but just hear me out.

645
00:44:00,169 --> 00:44:03,139
No, why is the hair on the back of
my neck starting to stand up?

646
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:05,732
Okay, now, we could call the police,
we could do that...

647
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,039
but you know where we'd be
spending our weekend...

648
00:44:08,111 --> 00:44:12,606
in some hot police station answering
questions we don't know the answers to.

649
00:44:12,684 --> 00:44:15,983
Now, obviously Bernie felt
he owed us something here...

650
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:19,388
some small little favor for discovering
those mistakes at the company.

651
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:22,757
That's why he invited us out here
for the weekend in the first place.

652
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:26,162
It'd be almost disrespectful
not to grant him his final wish.

653
00:44:26,233 --> 00:44:30,693
All I am saying is,
why don't we just pretend he didn't die?

654
00:44:33,473 --> 00:44:34,998
Just for a bit?

655
00:44:41,282 --> 00:44:43,649
I don't believe I am hearing this.

656
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:46,950
I loved that man. He loved me.

657
00:44:47,189 --> 00:44:48,952
I know he loved you.

658
00:44:49,725 --> 00:44:51,455
He'd want this.

659
00:44:52,128 --> 00:44:56,394
I mean he would really want this.

660
00:44:58,335 --> 00:45:01,429
Yes, Operator, can you get me
the police, please? Thank you.

661
00:45:01,505 --> 00:45:04,133
Incidentally,
you're a disgusting human being.

662
00:45:05,876 --> 00:45:07,003
Gwen.

663
00:45:11,182 --> 00:45:13,582
- Well, hello, Gwen.
- Wayne. Hi.

664
00:45:14,854 --> 00:45:17,015
<i>Hampton Bay Police Department.</i>

665
00:45:17,657 --> 00:45:19,181
<i>Hello?</i>

666
00:45:20,459 --> 00:45:21,858
It's amazing.

667
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:26,731
<i>- Hello. Police department.
- I'll call the police.</i>

668
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,258
No, you know, you were right.
Bernie would have wanted it this way.

669
00:45:30,337 --> 00:45:32,431
No, I think we should call the police.

670
00:45:32,507 --> 00:45:35,271
Larry, just give me 10 minutes, okay?

671
00:45:36,711 --> 00:45:37,837
Take 20.

672
00:45:39,148 --> 00:45:40,945
- Hi.
- Hi, Freda.

673
00:45:41,016 --> 00:45:42,540
Darling, you look wonderful.

674
00:45:43,919 --> 00:45:45,682
$45,000.

675
00:45:45,921 --> 00:45:49,085
Plus free tennis lessons.
That's it, take it or leave it.

676
00:45:52,896 --> 00:45:55,457
Is this guy a tough negotiator or what?

677
00:45:56,767 --> 00:45:58,667
Keep the piece of shit.

678
00:46:03,442 --> 00:46:04,807
What a bash.

679
00:46:06,945 --> 00:46:10,039
You animal. You are insatiable.

680
00:46:10,349 --> 00:46:12,477
You slay me, Bernie.

681
00:46:12,552 --> 00:46:16,420
- I've got to talk to you.
- Bernie is a little wasted right now.

682
00:46:16,489 --> 00:46:18,923
Hi. Wait. Okay.

683
00:46:18,993 --> 00:46:21,621
I can't blame you if you
never want to speak to me again.

684
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,220
If I were you, I wouldn't want
to speak to me, either.

685
00:46:24,298 --> 00:46:28,565
But I just want to tell you I am sorry
for being such a jerk last night.

686
00:46:28,637 --> 00:46:32,164
I don't know what got into me.
I hope you can forgive me.

687
00:46:36,278 --> 00:46:40,715
It was kind of funny, seeing your father
in his underwear and everything.

688
00:46:42,418 --> 00:46:46,116
- So you do forgive me?
- No, but it was kind of funny.

689
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:49,284
I'll never lie again. Honest.

690
00:46:52,563 --> 00:46:54,224
So what are you doing here?

691
00:46:54,298 --> 00:46:57,995
Mr. Lomax invited me and my friend Larry
for the weekend.

692
00:46:58,236 --> 00:47:01,400
- Moving up in the company?
- Yeah.

693
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:05,969
I saw this great play. Yeah, it's called...

694
00:47:07,747 --> 00:47:10,215
You are on your own for a minute here.

695
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:13,017
Great writer.

696
00:47:14,821 --> 00:47:16,221
Well, hello.

697
00:47:19,827 --> 00:47:21,192
I'm Larry.

698
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:23,421
Fuck off, Larry.

699
00:47:24,966 --> 00:47:26,194
Okay.

700
00:47:27,736 --> 00:47:29,795
By the way, how's your aunt?

701
00:47:30,005 --> 00:47:31,769
- Who?
- Your aunt?

702
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:35,137
- She passed away.
- I'm sorry.

703
00:47:35,211 --> 00:47:36,405
It's all right.

704
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:39,539
Didn't you say you'd be spending
this weekend with your parents?

705
00:47:39,615 --> 00:47:42,642
- Yes, I did. I am. They have a house here.
- Great.

706
00:47:45,122 --> 00:47:47,716
There's Bernie. I wanted to thank him
for my summer job.

707
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:49,521
I'll be right back.

708
00:47:49,861 --> 00:47:51,021
No!

709
00:47:54,899 --> 00:47:56,026
What?

710
00:47:57,169 --> 00:47:58,397
Nothing.

711
00:48:05,879 --> 00:48:08,006
Go see Bernie about it. Go see Bernie.

712
00:48:08,081 --> 00:48:11,175
- Gwen, darling, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

713
00:48:11,384 --> 00:48:15,344
Have I ever told you
I never liked the name Gwen on you?

714
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:18,156
To me you'll always be Vanessa.

715
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,921
Her father and I,
we went to Harvard together.

716
00:48:22,231 --> 00:48:24,825
You are probably right. Oh, Bernie.

717
00:48:25,033 --> 00:48:27,058
Here we go, sugar, move it over!
Okay, baby?

718
00:48:27,136 --> 00:48:28,194
Asshole!

719
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:31,763
- I don't understand why we've to move him.
- Don't ask. Just move him.

720
00:48:31,841 --> 00:48:33,069
Here we go. Ready?

721
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:37,046
- I can't believe I'm touching a dead body.
- He was your boss. Come on, let's go.

722
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:42,683
- What a kidder.
- Bernie, you had a little too much.

723
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,382
Come on, you had too much again,
you big knucklehead.

724
00:48:45,457 --> 00:48:47,118
Come on, let's go.

725
00:48:47,192 --> 00:48:48,750
Come on. He is crazy.

726
00:48:48,827 --> 00:48:50,624
Here we go. Walk it off, big guy.

727
00:48:50,695 --> 00:48:52,060
Nice outfit.

728
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:56,067
Look even nicer
crumpled up on my floor in the morning.

729
00:48:58,404 --> 00:49:00,497
Polyester doesn't crumple.

730
00:49:03,744 --> 00:49:06,304
- Here we go. That's it, Bernie.
- Hi, Bernie.

731
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,276
- Just like last week, huh?
- Come on.

732
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:14,688
All right. Okay.

733
00:49:14,956 --> 00:49:18,916
Look me in the eye. $50,000.

734
00:49:18,994 --> 00:49:22,691
Yes! I knew it! Thank you, Bernie!

735
00:49:22,765 --> 00:49:25,894
Thank you so much. This guy is like family.

736
00:49:25,969 --> 00:49:27,368
You are beautiful!

737
00:49:27,938 --> 00:49:30,429
Grab him. Larry.

738
00:49:32,509 --> 00:49:34,637
- Jesus.
- Oh, God.

739
00:49:35,313 --> 00:49:38,805
- Hi, boys. Great view.
- Hello, there. How are you?

740
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,582
I give it an 8.3.

741
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:47,656
We can't just leave him there, you know.

742
00:49:57,504 --> 00:50:01,941
<i>Girl. Beach. Sand. Surf. Moonlight.
Did you ever see Here to Eternity?</i>

743
00:50:07,682 --> 00:50:09,775
You are right. We better get him.

744
00:50:10,452 --> 00:50:13,718
- Thirty minutes. Then we call the cops.
- Not a second more.

745
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,652
Ladies, how are you?

746
00:50:29,468 --> 00:50:29,962
Hi.

747
00:50:29,997 --> 00:50:30,457
Hi.

748
00:50:39,712 --> 00:50:41,942
Are we allowed to talk or anything?

749
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:50,317
Why did you leave the party?

750
00:50:50,389 --> 00:50:53,654
I just don't feel comfortable
with most of those people.

751
00:50:53,726 --> 00:50:58,527
I don't really know any of those people.
I just know, knew, know Bernie.

752
00:50:59,164 --> 00:51:01,962
Besides, I figure
I can thank Bernie tomorrow.

753
00:51:02,034 --> 00:51:03,763
When there's more privacy.

754
00:51:05,237 --> 00:51:08,604
- Where are we going?
- There's a beautiful view from up there.

755
00:51:09,642 --> 00:51:10,666
Great.

756
00:51:18,785 --> 00:51:20,980
Ever been in a lighthouse before?

757
00:51:21,054 --> 00:51:23,921
No, this is my first time. This is great.

758
00:51:24,391 --> 00:51:28,521
Does anybody live up there?
A lighthouse keeper or someone?

759
00:51:28,595 --> 00:51:31,155
No, It's all automated now. Come on.

760
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,992
That takes some of the romance out of it.

761
00:51:38,538 --> 00:51:39,698
Does it?

762
00:51:59,592 --> 00:52:01,116
- You all right?
- Yeah.

763
00:52:07,067 --> 00:52:09,467
You're right. This is beautiful.

764
00:52:11,037 --> 00:52:14,097
My God.
You can see the whole island from up here.

765
00:52:18,478 --> 00:52:20,469
I've always wondered
how these things work.

766
00:52:20,547 --> 00:52:21,912
Richard, don't.

767
00:52:22,649 --> 00:52:25,015
- I can't see.
- Watch out for the trap...

768
00:52:26,853 --> 00:52:27,877
door.

769
00:52:33,393 --> 00:52:34,621
Oh, my God.

770
00:52:42,536 --> 00:52:44,265
- That one works.
- Richard.

771
00:52:45,406 --> 00:52:47,135
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

772
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:49,335
- Are you sure?
- I fell down a couple of stairs.

773
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:51,241
- Anything broken?
- Nothing's broken.

774
00:52:51,312 --> 00:52:54,110
- Are you sure?
- A little pain, but I'm all right.

775
00:52:54,181 --> 00:52:56,274
- I'm fine. How are you?
- I'm good.

776
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:58,174
Here. Hold on.

777
00:52:58,252 --> 00:53:00,379
The good news is, I can see again.

778
00:53:07,294 --> 00:53:09,854
- I'm so sorry, Richard.
- No, it's okay, really.

779
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:11,795
I've always wanted a limp.

780
00:53:12,433 --> 00:53:14,492
I must thank you.
This has been a great date.

781
00:53:14,568 --> 00:53:16,695
I hope my major medical covers it.

782
00:53:17,204 --> 00:53:18,228
What?

783
00:53:19,173 --> 00:53:22,734
I'm sorry. I don't mean to laugh...

784
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:26,839
but the look on your face
when you fell through the trapdoor.

785
00:53:27,081 --> 00:53:29,072
I think I've got a cracked rib.

786
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:31,948
- Do you want to sit down?
- No.

787
00:53:32,019 --> 00:53:35,853
No, I better not. The way things are going,
I'm gonna break my ass.

788
00:53:36,257 --> 00:53:37,849
You'll be okay.

789
00:54:06,053 --> 00:54:08,988
I've had a crush on you
since the first day I saw you at work.

790
00:54:09,056 --> 00:54:10,524
I'm crazy about you.

791
00:54:13,962 --> 00:54:15,395
This is so right.

792
00:54:17,466 --> 00:54:20,629
Oh, my God. This can't be happening to me.

793
00:54:20,735 --> 00:54:24,466
It's happening to both of us.
You're right. It's so right.

794
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:27,235
No. This isn't right, it's all wrong.
Not here in the sand.

795
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:28,776
- What?
- You deserve more than this.

796
00:54:28,844 --> 00:54:31,574
You need music, flowers, candles.
You need...

797
00:54:36,184 --> 00:54:38,175
You need to get out of here.

798
00:54:38,253 --> 00:54:41,188
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm serious. You could catch a cold.

799
00:54:41,256 --> 00:54:43,247
- Where do you live?
- Dune Walk.

800
00:55:01,409 --> 00:55:02,899
Are you dead, too?

801
00:55:04,045 --> 00:55:05,808
Mister? Hello?

802
00:55:06,381 --> 00:55:08,679
Oh, Jesus. What is it with this place?

803
00:55:11,419 --> 00:55:13,717
How are you? Party's over.
You have to go home now.

804
00:55:13,788 --> 00:55:15,517
- Where's Bernie?
- He's swimming.

805
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:18,286
I had a wonderful time.
I'm sorry I had to leave so early.

806
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,885
Have fun. See you at the next one. Larry!

807
00:55:30,805 --> 00:55:32,500
Larry, are you in there?

808
00:55:32,641 --> 00:55:35,508
- Come on out, Lar. Right now.
- Go away.

809
00:55:35,577 --> 00:55:37,169
I need to talk to you.

810
00:55:39,615 --> 00:55:41,640
Can you just give me 30 seconds?

811
00:55:42,685 --> 00:55:44,880
Bernie is waiting for us.

812
00:55:46,756 --> 00:55:50,453
- Look, Bernie isn't going anywhere, okay?
- I need you, Lar.

813
00:55:50,726 --> 00:55:51,920
Bernie, he needs you, too.

814
00:55:52,061 --> 00:55:53,050
Unbelievable.

815
00:55:54,163 --> 00:55:57,428
How am I supposed to know
that the tide is gonna come up that high?

816
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,434
I don't want to talk about it.

817
00:55:59,502 --> 00:56:02,062
I don't understand why this is becoming
all my fault.

818
00:56:03,105 --> 00:56:05,801
- Did you invite somebody over?
- Of course not.

819
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:06,967
Somebody's here.

820
00:56:07,043 --> 00:56:09,807
Let's just shove him in the bedroom,
we'll say he's sleeping.

821
00:56:10,379 --> 00:56:12,904
Bernie, you cheat.

822
00:56:13,215 --> 00:56:14,443
Two-timer.

823
00:56:21,891 --> 00:56:23,290
Bernie, open up.

824
00:56:26,362 --> 00:56:27,920
Darn you, Bernie.

825
00:56:28,631 --> 00:56:30,189
Don't do this to me.

826
00:56:35,171 --> 00:56:37,833
Where the hell are you, you son of a bitch?

827
00:56:37,974 --> 00:56:40,602
I got you now, you two-timing bastard.

828
00:56:43,179 --> 00:56:46,046
Who the hell are you? Where's Bernie?

829
00:56:46,582 --> 00:56:48,641
We're Bernie's houseguests. Who are you?

830
00:56:48,718 --> 00:56:50,049
I'm his woman.

831
00:56:51,053 --> 00:56:54,545
And I'll kill him if he's cheating on me.
Now, where the hell is he?

832
00:56:54,624 --> 00:56:57,115
And don't try to cover up for him, either.

833
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,992
- He's not here.
- Haven't seen him.

834
00:57:00,062 --> 00:57:01,620
I don't believe you.

835
00:57:02,832 --> 00:57:05,027
I'm gonna tear this place apart.

836
00:57:11,308 --> 00:57:13,799
- That's his woman?
- I guess so.

837
00:57:24,888 --> 00:57:26,651
Where the hell is he?

838
00:57:26,723 --> 00:57:29,385
- He's in the bedroom.
- Is that so?

839
00:57:30,927 --> 00:57:32,394
He better be alone.

840
00:57:37,167 --> 00:57:38,498
God damn it.

841
00:57:38,568 --> 00:57:40,092
Fun while it lasted, huh?

842
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:43,333
What difference does it make,
we might as well get this over with.

843
00:57:43,407 --> 00:57:46,604
This is good. She discovers the body,
she calls the police.

844
00:57:46,677 --> 00:57:48,611
Fix me a drink, will you?

845
00:57:49,246 --> 00:57:51,146
I hate it when they scream.

846
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:17,472
Oh, no!

847
00:58:32,556 --> 00:58:36,653
What gives? She has been up there, what,

848
00:58:37,528 --> 00:58:39,120
I don't get it.

849
00:59:09,727 --> 00:59:11,490
Got a little scotch?

850
00:59:13,531 --> 00:59:14,623
Sure.

851
00:59:26,944 --> 00:59:30,675
- Did everything go okay up there?
- Never been better.

852
00:59:35,853 --> 00:59:36,945
Good.

853
00:59:47,465 --> 00:59:51,424
How do you like that?
The guy gets laid more dead than I do alive.

854
00:59:52,503 --> 00:59:54,061
No, she couldn't have.

855
00:59:55,406 --> 00:59:56,839
He couldn't have.

856
00:59:57,508 --> 00:59:59,806
I get yelled at when I just lay there.

857
01:00:24,303 --> 01:00:28,831
Vito, I'm telling you, Lomax is alive.
She was with him for at least half an hour...

858
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:32,575
<i>- in the bedroom.
- What were they doing in the bedroom?</i>

859
01:00:32,644 --> 01:00:34,612
I'd rather not say.

860
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,773
<i>What the hell happened to Paulie?</i>

861
01:00:36,849 --> 01:00:40,307
Yeah, maybe Paulie
is rustier than we thought, huh?

862
01:00:42,721 --> 01:00:46,555
- What a night.
- Great, isn't it? It isn't over yet.

863
01:00:46,792 --> 01:00:49,852
It is for me. I'm dead. No offense, Bernie.

864
01:00:50,662 --> 01:00:52,527
I just gotta lie down for a minute.

865
01:00:52,598 --> 01:00:56,398
Suit yourself. Whatever you like.
I'm going on to find the next party.

866
01:00:56,869 --> 01:01:00,100
- Just wake me up when you get back.
- Okay, sure.

867
01:01:00,172 --> 01:01:02,606
- Whatever you like.
- Because I got to call the cops.

868
01:01:02,674 --> 01:01:05,802
- Of course you do. In the morning.
- I need a clear head.

869
01:01:06,211 --> 01:01:07,644
Good night, buddy.

870
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,942
Don't forget. Wake me up.

871
01:01:20,592 --> 01:01:23,618
I made these a little sweeter this time.
Okay, Bernie?

872
01:01:24,496 --> 01:01:26,293
God, it's glorious out, huh?

873
01:01:27,866 --> 01:01:29,458
Here we go, my friend.

874
01:01:30,702 --> 01:01:32,193
This should do it.

875
01:01:34,307 --> 01:01:35,296
Okay.

876
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:37,505
How did you deal with?

877
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:41,580
Oriental? I think I own that one.

878
01:01:42,415 --> 01:01:43,746
With hotel.

879
01:01:45,151 --> 01:01:46,778
$550.

880
01:01:46,853 --> 01:01:49,014
Give me $600, we'll call it square.

881
01:01:49,088 --> 01:01:50,749
Hey, Bernie, Larry.

882
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:53,450
Great party last night, Bernie.
Your best ever.

883
01:01:53,526 --> 01:01:55,892
Ladies. Hello. How are you today?

884
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:56,986
- Great.
- Fine.

885
01:01:57,063 --> 01:02:00,464
- Are we doing it again today?
- Absolutely. You know we are.

886
01:02:00,533 --> 01:02:02,728
- Great. We'll see you later, guys.
- Bye-bye.

887
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:05,066
Bye-bye, ladies. We'll see you later.

888
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:08,635
Is this great or what?

889
01:02:09,909 --> 01:02:11,900
Okay, coming out. My turn.

890
01:02:12,211 --> 01:02:13,439
Shooter now.

891
01:02:14,013 --> 01:02:16,914
Yes! Free parking. $500 for me.

892
01:02:23,523 --> 01:02:24,615
Bastard!

893
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:33,788
I own it. Okay, that is $24...

894
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,926
I own them all. $46, my friend. Call it $50.

895
01:02:37,236 --> 01:02:39,796
Thank you. My turn. Here we go.

896
01:02:39,872 --> 01:02:41,499
Lucky seven coming out.

897
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:42,698
Shit.

898
01:02:43,576 --> 01:02:47,740
One more you get out of jail free.
All right. Fine. Your turn. I'll roll.

899
01:02:47,814 --> 01:02:49,441
Here we go. Coming out.

900
01:02:51,451 --> 01:02:52,816
Community Chest.

901
01:02:54,387 --> 01:02:56,548
Second prize in a beauty contest.

902
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,959
- What are you doing?
- Playing Monopoly. You want to play?

903
01:03:00,027 --> 01:03:02,086
- No.
- Here we go.

904
01:03:02,863 --> 01:03:04,854
- How did he get down here?
- He walked.

905
01:03:04,932 --> 01:03:06,297
- He walked?
- Say good morning.

906
01:03:07,067 --> 01:03:10,002
Oh, God. You're just a sick man, Larry.

907
01:03:10,637 --> 01:03:13,765
- What time is it?
- It's 11:30.

908
01:03:16,243 --> 01:03:18,939
You let me sleep till 11:30? I have...

909
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,714
- When did you get a Rolex?
- Oh, this.

910
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:28,282
- Good God!
- He didn't need it anymore.

911
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:31,691
That's it. We're gonna go to jail.
They're gonna arrest us.

912
01:03:31,759 --> 01:03:35,422
- I'm calling the cops.
- I wanted to call them yesterday, my friend.

913
01:03:36,397 --> 01:03:38,490
He's very upset. Richard, look.

914
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:42,792
Let me just say one thing here.
There's no reason to get pissy about this.

915
01:03:45,639 --> 01:03:46,731
Hello.

916
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:50,676
- Richard?
- It's for you.

917
01:03:51,645 --> 01:03:53,476
- Gwen.
- Hi.

918
01:03:54,515 --> 01:03:56,346
What are you doing here?

919
01:03:59,453 --> 01:04:03,150
I just came by to talk to Bernie.
I didn't get a chance to last night, so...

920
01:04:03,223 --> 01:04:06,056
Oh, no. Bernie and I
are in a very big business meeting.

921
01:04:06,126 --> 01:04:07,320
- Now?
- Yes.

922
01:04:07,394 --> 01:04:10,363
Bernie has such little time,
so can you come back later?

923
01:04:10,431 --> 01:04:13,195
Wait a minute.
What happened to Mr. Romantic?

924
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:17,226
- Candlelight? Flowers?
- I know. But Bernie is tied up right now.

925
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:22,200
- It's a bad time.
- What is going on, Richard?

926
01:04:22,276 --> 01:04:24,642
Okay. I'll tell you.

927
01:04:24,711 --> 01:04:27,271
I probably shouldn't,
I know I shouldn't, but...

928
01:04:27,347 --> 01:04:30,317
at this point, why not? Mr. Lomax is...

929
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,929
my boss. I work for him
at the insurance company.

930
01:04:45,066 --> 01:04:47,091
Bernie, you're starting to peel.

931
01:04:47,302 --> 01:04:49,463
Better get you out of the sun, huh?

932
01:04:51,573 --> 01:04:52,870
Here we go.

933
01:05:00,048 --> 01:05:02,608
We were really looking forward
to coming out here...

934
01:05:02,684 --> 01:05:04,618
when we got here, Mr. Lomax...

935
01:05:05,253 --> 01:05:06,618
Bernie was...

936
01:05:08,756 --> 01:05:09,780
dead.

937
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,252
Dead.

938
01:05:13,461 --> 01:05:16,624
Like your mother and father were dead.
And your aunt is dead, too?

939
01:05:16,698 --> 01:05:17,687
Different kind of dead.

940
01:05:30,912 --> 01:05:33,380
You son of a bitch. I got you.

941
01:05:38,453 --> 01:05:42,014
Then how come I saw Bernie
with you and your friend at the party?

942
01:05:43,358 --> 01:05:44,985
Because...

943
01:05:47,362 --> 01:05:48,886
You don't believe me?

944
01:05:50,732 --> 01:05:53,223
Okay, I'm gonna prove it to you. Come on.

945
01:05:53,401 --> 01:05:54,834
This is not going to be fun.

946
01:06:07,716 --> 01:06:09,877
I know you think I'm crazy, but...

947
01:06:14,657 --> 01:06:15,646
Well?

948
01:06:17,226 --> 01:06:18,591
Where is Bernie?

949
01:06:19,094 --> 01:06:20,356
Oh, hello.

950
01:06:21,397 --> 01:06:23,592
- Where's Bernie?
- He went for more daiquiri mix.

951
01:06:23,666 --> 01:06:24,928
No, he didn't.

952
01:06:25,034 --> 01:06:27,832
Richard, I don't know what
this game is you're playing...

953
01:06:27,903 --> 01:06:29,632
but this is ridiculous.

954
01:06:29,705 --> 01:06:32,469
- I'm out of here.
- Gwen, I'm not playing any games with you.

955
01:06:32,541 --> 01:06:35,032
I'm telling you the truth! Bernie is here.

956
01:06:36,445 --> 01:06:38,174
Where is Bernie?

957
01:06:38,247 --> 01:06:40,943
What, you bastard, did you do with Bernie?

958
01:06:45,554 --> 01:06:47,283
I'm phoning the police.

959
01:06:53,596 --> 01:06:56,394
There's no dial tone. With 97 buttons...

960
01:06:58,267 --> 01:07:01,259
<i>- Where is your house?
- Where is the off button?</i>

961
01:07:01,337 --> 01:07:04,306
<i>Look, Paulie, just don't kill them
while I'm around.</i>

962
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:07,509
<i>- Bernie, we're on a phone here.
- You're right.</i>

963
01:07:07,576 --> 01:07:10,067
- Play that back.
- I just got it stopped.

964
01:07:10,145 --> 01:07:11,772
Play it back, please.

965
01:07:14,883 --> 01:07:18,011
<i>Hey, Lomax, it's Paulie.
I just got to the island.</i>

966
01:07:18,554 --> 01:07:19,543
<i>You're early.</i>

967
01:07:19,622 --> 01:07:21,988
<i>Those two schmucks
won't come until the 6:00 ferry...</i>

968
01:07:22,057 --> 01:07:24,754
<i>- and I still have to plant the note.
- Yeah.</i>

969
01:07:25,195 --> 01:07:28,426
<i>- Where is your house?
- It's on the point, top of the dune.</i>

970
01:07:28,965 --> 01:07:30,523
<i>Look, Paulie...</i>

971
01:07:30,867 --> 01:07:34,359
<i>- don't kill them while I'm around.
- Bernie, we're on the phone here.</i>

972
01:07:34,437 --> 01:07:36,371
<i>You're right. I'm sorry.</i>

973
01:07:36,439 --> 01:07:39,499
<i>The point is, I just want to be
back in New York with an alibi.</i>

974
01:07:39,576 --> 01:07:41,066
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

975
01:07:45,415 --> 01:07:47,315
We were on the 6:00 ferry.

976
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,780
And we're two schmucks.

977
01:07:53,723 --> 01:07:55,884
- Kill us?
- Lomax?

978
01:07:56,493 --> 01:07:59,087
Bernie is gonna have us killed?

979
01:08:01,665 --> 01:08:02,791
Kill us?

980
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:05,567
- Why?
- I don't know.

981
01:08:08,738 --> 01:08:12,105
Unless he's the one
whose been stealing from the company.

982
01:08:12,842 --> 01:08:15,606
Son of a bitch. He's gonna kill me!

983
01:08:16,513 --> 01:08:17,912
I liked the guy.

984
01:08:18,882 --> 01:08:19,940
Okay.

985
01:08:20,116 --> 01:08:22,550
He said something about a note, right?

986
01:08:22,619 --> 01:08:25,110
- I know, Richard.
- Let's find it.

987
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:45,098
Bernie, you lying swine.

988
01:08:51,848 --> 01:08:53,544
Holy crap!

989
01:08:53,984 --> 01:08:55,110
What?

990
01:09:04,929 --> 01:09:08,023
- There's a $100,000 here easy.
- This is the note. Listen.

991
01:09:08,099 --> 01:09:11,626
"Richard Parker and I
stole this money from the company...

992
01:09:13,637 --> 01:09:16,538
- "to pay for my sex change operation."
- What?

993
01:09:16,607 --> 01:09:18,302
That's what it says.

994
01:09:18,743 --> 01:09:23,305
"Now he tells me he loves someone else.
I can't live with that, and neither will he."

995
01:09:24,982 --> 01:09:26,916
It's got my name on it.

996
01:09:28,419 --> 01:09:29,886
Oh, God.

997
01:09:31,689 --> 01:09:34,817
Son of a bitch. It's not bad enough
that he's trying to kill me...

998
01:09:34,892 --> 01:09:37,258
now he's turning me into a drag queen.

999
01:09:38,462 --> 01:09:40,760
Why couldn't he say
you were having the operation?

1000
01:09:40,831 --> 01:09:43,231
- It doesn't matter.
- It does matter, Richard.

1001
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:46,667
- I've a reputation to protect here.
- For Christ's sakes, Larry!

1002
01:09:46,737 --> 01:09:49,797
No one is going
to have a sex change operation.

1003
01:09:52,109 --> 01:09:53,474
Oh, yeah!

1004
01:09:53,544 --> 01:09:55,171
I got to call the cops.

1005
01:09:57,014 --> 01:09:59,710
<i>- Operator.
- Operator, the police, please.</i>

1006
01:10:00,117 --> 01:10:03,245
<i>You mean Ed?
He's out on the beach somewhere.</i>

1007
01:10:03,421 --> 01:10:06,754
When do you expect Ed back?
It's a bit of an emergency.

1008
01:10:06,824 --> 01:10:09,691
<i>I don't know. Wanna leave a message?</i>

1009
01:10:09,794 --> 01:10:11,227
<i>- Yeah. Help!
- Okay.</i>

1010
01:10:11,295 --> 01:10:13,126
Let's get out of here.

1011
01:10:16,133 --> 01:10:19,398
We have to get off this island,
and maybe not get killed doing it.

1012
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:23,237
- Wait a minute.
- Tell me you have a brilliant idea.

1013
01:10:23,542 --> 01:10:25,669
- I have an idea.
- What is it?

1014
01:10:25,744 --> 01:10:29,771
Lomax told whoever he was talking to
not to kill us if he's around, right?

1015
01:10:29,848 --> 01:10:32,612
But Lomax is dead.
He isn't around anybody anymore.

1016
01:10:32,684 --> 01:10:34,845
I know that. You know that.

1017
01:10:36,154 --> 01:10:37,781
Nobody else knows that.

1018
01:10:38,623 --> 01:10:39,647
Where's Bernie?

1019
01:10:41,827 --> 01:10:43,192
Right there.

1020
01:10:44,062 --> 01:10:45,495
There's no Bernie.

1021
01:10:46,598 --> 01:10:48,828
He's gotta to be, Rich.
I dumped him here myself.

1022
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,060
Where is he?

1023
01:10:51,436 --> 01:10:52,903
- Larry.
- What?

1024
01:10:57,542 --> 01:10:59,203
- Excuse me.
- Hey, kid.

1025
01:10:59,277 --> 01:11:01,074
- What are you doing?
- What do you want?

1026
01:11:01,146 --> 01:11:02,807
- You little brat!
- What are you doing?

1027
01:11:02,881 --> 01:11:04,508
Get out of there.

1028
01:11:04,583 --> 01:11:07,017
- What the hell are you doing?
- You can't do that.

1029
01:11:07,085 --> 01:11:08,814
This is private property.

1030
01:11:09,554 --> 01:11:11,488
- You're talking to me?
- Yeah.

1031
01:11:11,556 --> 01:11:13,854
- Shut up.
- Who are you... You lousy...

1032
01:11:15,527 --> 01:11:18,121
You better be gone by the time we get there.

1033
01:11:18,196 --> 01:11:21,256
- Scram! Get out of here!
- You little bastard.

1034
01:11:21,666 --> 01:11:23,827
How'd you like to kiss this?

1035
01:11:24,002 --> 01:11:25,936
- We have bigger problems.
- Kiss my ass.

1036
01:11:26,004 --> 01:11:29,337
- What kind of home training is that?
- He buried all of Bernie.

1037
01:11:29,407 --> 01:11:30,465
Jesus.

1038
01:11:30,842 --> 01:11:31,831
Come on.

1039
01:11:51,197 --> 01:11:55,691
- Good thing for you, you're dead, pal.
- I actually felt sorry for you, you rat shit.

1040
01:11:55,768 --> 01:11:57,759
He looks good enough. Let's go.

1041
01:11:58,404 --> 01:11:59,894
- Larry.
- What?

1042
01:12:01,173 --> 01:12:02,504
Jesus.

1043
01:12:03,209 --> 01:12:05,575
I never knew he wore a toupee.
You can hardly tell.

1044
01:12:05,645 --> 01:12:09,137
Who cares? What are we gonna do about it?
We can't take him out like this.

1045
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:12,082
The killer might not know it's Bernie
and shoot us.

1046
01:12:16,122 --> 01:12:19,649
- So long, Lar, it has been fun but not really.
- Goodbye, Rich.

1047
01:12:26,532 --> 01:12:29,262
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is...

1048
01:12:30,536 --> 01:12:31,560
Jesus.

1049
01:12:31,704 --> 01:12:34,264
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is...

1050
01:12:40,913 --> 01:12:42,505
You little bastard.

1051
01:12:44,317 --> 01:12:46,877
- Get back here, you little monster.
- Never mind him.

1052
01:12:46,953 --> 01:12:48,750
I'm gonna rip your gums out!

1053
01:12:48,888 --> 01:12:52,483
- I'm gonna get that little kid.
- What are we gonna do with Bernie?

1054
01:12:55,695 --> 01:12:56,684
Oh, boy.

1055
01:12:59,231 --> 01:13:02,257
Come on, Bernie. Up.

1056
01:13:05,271 --> 01:13:07,205
Put it on him.

1057
01:13:08,674 --> 01:13:09,936
Brilliant.

1058
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:16,073
- Sambuca on the rocks.
- Yes, sir.

1059
01:13:26,026 --> 01:13:28,017
Here we go. Ready. Up.

1060
01:13:30,263 --> 01:13:32,527
You take him down. I'll get the cart.

1061
01:13:50,784 --> 01:13:52,274
Hey, Bernie!

1062
01:13:54,588 --> 01:13:55,919
Bernie, wait a minute.

1063
01:13:55,989 --> 01:13:58,514
- That guy talking to us?
- Who cares? Get out of here.

1064
01:13:58,592 --> 01:14:00,583
Bernie, I've got to talk to you.

1065
01:14:01,461 --> 01:14:02,894
Bernie, come on.

1066
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,491
- Hey, Bernie. Looking good.
- Hi.

1067
01:14:09,102 --> 01:14:10,763
- Hi, Bernie.
- Hello.

1068
01:14:12,172 --> 01:14:14,697
- Great party last night, Bern.
- How are you?

1069
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:18,211
Bernie, I've got to talk to you.

1070
01:14:18,278 --> 01:14:19,870
Jesus. He's behind us.

1071
01:14:21,114 --> 01:14:23,082
Shit! Is that the killer?

1072
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:25,414
How do I know, Richard?
Should I stop and ask him?

1073
01:14:25,485 --> 01:14:27,043
No. Just drive. Just go.

1074
01:14:27,154 --> 01:14:28,985
Bernie, I gotta talk to you.

1075
01:14:29,356 --> 01:14:32,189
- Doesn't this thing go any faster?
- This is it.

1076
01:14:32,626 --> 01:14:33,957
We gotta talk.

1077
01:14:37,197 --> 01:14:38,687
What about our arrangement?

1078
01:14:38,765 --> 01:14:40,756
Come on, Larry. Move it.

1079
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:52,541
Hey, Bernie. The Maserati.
I painted it black for you.

1080
01:14:53,414 --> 01:14:54,904
The Maserati!

1081
01:15:02,457 --> 01:15:03,822
Ferry's gonna leave.

1082
01:15:03,891 --> 01:15:06,758
Hold it. Wait. Stop this for a second.

1083
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:10,061
Let's go.

1084
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:13,931
Rich, grab him. Grab a leg.

1085
01:15:14,001 --> 01:15:15,901
Wait.

1086
01:15:16,003 --> 01:15:19,302
We can't just drag him in.
He's got to look like he's alive.

1087
01:15:20,775 --> 01:15:21,799
Idea.

1088
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:34,611
Your right leg on three, ready?
Here we go. One, two, three, go.

1089
01:15:34,689 --> 01:15:35,849
Hold the boat!

1090
01:15:35,923 --> 01:15:37,550
Got it? Hold the boat.

1091
01:15:37,625 --> 01:15:39,752
Hold that boat.

1092
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:43,458
Hold it.

1093
01:15:43,631 --> 01:15:44,962
- Hi, Bern.
- How are you doing?

1094
01:15:45,032 --> 01:15:46,932
Hold the boat!

1095
01:15:48,436 --> 01:15:50,461
Hold the boat, please.

1096
01:15:50,538 --> 01:15:52,472
Hold on. We'll be right there.

1097
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:55,802
We're coming.

1098
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:03,578
Come on, Bern.

1099
01:16:04,919 --> 01:16:07,012
Hold it. Hold the boat.

1100
01:16:07,989 --> 01:16:10,253
Shit! What do we do?

1101
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:12,621
Stop the boat.

1102
01:16:14,229 --> 01:16:17,096
Look at this fool.
He wants to get off, we want to get on.

1103
01:16:17,166 --> 01:16:18,997
- I'm gonna kill you.
- What?

1104
01:16:19,067 --> 01:16:21,865
You don't have to worry about
anybody else murdering you...

1105
01:16:21,937 --> 01:16:23,928
because I'll do it. This was all your fault.

1106
01:16:24,006 --> 01:16:26,531
- We'll die on this crummy island.
- Let me remind you...

1107
01:16:26,608 --> 01:16:29,099
you're the one who did the extra work
on the computer.

1108
01:16:29,178 --> 01:16:31,408
If it wasn't for me
you'd be fired six months ago.

1109
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,175
You can't even work the coffee machine.

1110
01:16:33,248 --> 01:16:36,843
A little brownnosing, ass kissing,
to work our way up that corporate ladder.

1111
01:16:36,919 --> 01:16:39,387
Why can't you be a lazy shit like I am?

1112
01:16:40,455 --> 01:16:43,151
Somebody talk to the captain.

1113
01:16:43,792 --> 01:16:45,259
I've got to get off the boat.

1114
01:16:45,327 --> 01:16:46,954
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry.

1115
01:16:47,029 --> 01:16:48,291
Please.

1116
01:16:51,033 --> 01:16:52,933
Somebody talk to the captain.

1117
01:16:54,837 --> 01:16:57,897
- I'm sorry, but we're still gonna die.
- Not if Bernie's with us.

1118
01:16:57,973 --> 01:17:00,066
Great, I hope the killer keeps that in mind.

1119
01:17:00,142 --> 01:17:03,509
Larry, please tell me
how we're going to get off this island.

1120
01:17:06,048 --> 01:17:07,640
- We got a boat.
- What boat?

1121
01:17:07,716 --> 01:17:09,081
Lomax's boat.

1122
01:17:09,284 --> 01:17:11,809
- Tawny brought the keys back, remember?
- Right. Okay.

1123
01:17:11,887 --> 01:17:14,048
You go and get them,
I'll stay here with Bernie.

1124
01:17:14,122 --> 01:17:15,783
I'm not going anywhere without Bernie.

1125
01:17:15,858 --> 01:17:18,224
You go back, get the keys.
I'll stay with Bernie.

1126
01:17:18,293 --> 01:17:21,421
We'll all go back to the house.
We'll all get the goddamn keys.

1127
01:17:21,496 --> 01:17:23,623
- We'll all stay with Bernie.
- Fine.

1128
01:17:24,967 --> 01:17:25,956
Hurry up.

1129
01:17:26,802 --> 01:17:28,497
Move it.

1130
01:17:30,706 --> 01:17:32,003
Hold up.

1131
01:17:32,674 --> 01:17:33,971
Okay. The keys.

1132
01:17:34,676 --> 01:17:36,701
- Here they are.
- Got it. Let's go.

1133
01:17:36,778 --> 01:17:38,268
Oh, my God, Richard!

1134
01:17:40,115 --> 01:17:41,708
It's the killer.

1135
01:17:43,753 --> 01:17:45,050
Get the door.

1136
01:17:46,789 --> 01:17:47,949
Quiet.

1137
01:17:49,359 --> 01:17:51,088
- Lock it.
- I can't lock it.

1138
01:17:51,294 --> 01:17:53,023
I only have a key to the boat.

1139
01:17:54,130 --> 01:17:55,222
Kitchen.

1140
01:17:55,298 --> 01:17:58,495
- There's no door. Back door.
- Okay.

1141
01:18:03,239 --> 01:18:05,002
Don't panic.

1142
01:18:06,876 --> 01:18:08,605
Do something, Rich.

1143
01:18:08,878 --> 01:18:10,778
I got Bernie, you get the guy.

1144
01:18:12,448 --> 01:18:13,915
Do something, Rich.

1145
01:18:14,751 --> 01:18:16,013
Get him, Rich.

1146
01:18:20,823 --> 01:18:23,314
You in here, Lomax? You little bastard.

1147
01:18:24,093 --> 01:18:25,219
You jerk.

1148
01:18:27,897 --> 01:18:29,558
Kick me in the ass.

1149
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:32,390
It's my turn now.

1150
01:18:36,172 --> 01:18:37,400
Got him, Lar.

1151
01:18:44,314 --> 01:18:45,804
There's another one.

1152
01:18:53,022 --> 01:18:54,353
He's got a knife.

1153
01:18:56,993 --> 01:18:58,119
Mr. Lomax.

1154
01:18:59,195 --> 01:19:00,423
What the hell?

1155
01:19:06,602 --> 01:19:09,298
- You can come out now, Rambo.
- You sure, Rich?

1156
01:19:11,041 --> 01:19:12,167
Good job.

1157
01:19:15,079 --> 01:19:17,377
- Two killers.
- Anybody could be the killer.

1158
01:19:17,448 --> 01:19:21,441
- Jesus, we gotta get rid of them.
- Let's shove them in the kitchen pantry.

1159
01:19:27,725 --> 01:19:30,421
I don't know why
I have to carry the heavy guy.

1160
01:19:32,963 --> 01:19:34,487
Get his legs.

1161
01:19:35,366 --> 01:19:37,266
Larry, let me out.

1162
01:19:45,542 --> 01:19:46,941
Here comes Bernie.

1163
01:19:48,979 --> 01:19:50,003
Coming through!

1164
01:19:51,482 --> 01:19:53,211
There it is. Stop.

1165
01:19:55,352 --> 01:19:56,376
Hi, guys.

1166
01:19:57,821 --> 01:20:02,019
Ready? On three, here we go.
One, two, three.

1167
01:20:04,328 --> 01:20:05,590
Let's go.

1168
01:20:10,801 --> 01:20:12,132
Okay. Untie us.

1169
01:20:14,905 --> 01:20:15,929
Okay?

1170
01:20:17,341 --> 01:20:19,832
- Give me the keys.
- Have you ever driven a boat before?

1171
01:20:19,910 --> 01:20:21,639
I was born on a boat.

1172
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:30,243
This is a fancy boat.

1173
01:20:35,092 --> 01:20:36,616
- Push something.
- I am, Richard.

1174
01:20:36,693 --> 01:20:37,990
- Nothing's happening.
- I know.

1175
01:20:38,062 --> 01:20:40,190
- Push something else.
- Something's happening.

1176
01:20:40,265 --> 01:20:42,756
Something's definitely
happening here, huh?

1177
01:20:44,169 --> 01:20:46,137
Wait a minute, hold on.

1178
01:20:46,204 --> 01:20:48,229
Are you trying to give me a heart attack?

1179
01:20:49,441 --> 01:20:52,001
- I know it's here.
- Just keep pressing those buttons.

1180
01:20:52,377 --> 01:20:54,777
I'm pressing. I pressed that button.

1181
01:20:54,913 --> 01:20:57,006
- Nothing is happening, Larry.
- I know that.

1182
01:20:57,082 --> 01:20:59,482
- Did you try the key?
- Don't insult my intelligence.

1183
01:20:59,551 --> 01:21:00,984
- Try the key again.
- Fine.

1184
01:21:01,052 --> 01:21:02,451
See that?

1185
01:21:02,554 --> 01:21:04,954
- Here we go!
- We're going home. Give it some gas now.

1186
01:21:05,023 --> 01:21:06,251
Giving it gas.

1187
01:21:08,359 --> 01:21:09,951
Gas.

1188
01:21:10,028 --> 01:21:12,326
- Nothing's happening.
- More gas.

1189
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:13,761
A little more gas.

1190
01:21:13,832 --> 01:21:15,697
We're not moving. Why aren't we moving?

1191
01:21:15,767 --> 01:21:17,064
I don't know.

1192
01:21:17,635 --> 01:21:21,799
- Larry, you said you've done this before.
- It's different than my boat, okay?

1193
01:21:24,342 --> 01:21:25,900
Don't panic.

1194
01:21:26,111 --> 01:21:27,635
Stop the boat, Larry.

1195
01:21:28,913 --> 01:21:30,039
Stop!

1196
01:21:34,552 --> 01:21:35,849
Back it up.

1197
01:21:37,789 --> 01:21:39,086
We got it.

1198
01:21:39,157 --> 01:21:40,988
- What's going on?
- That's illegal.

1199
01:21:41,059 --> 01:21:44,187
- What you're doing is illegal.
- You have a nice day now.

1200
01:21:44,462 --> 01:21:45,690
Are you nuts?

1201
01:21:48,233 --> 01:21:51,600
- Got it now. Moving forward. Hold on.
- Oh, shit!

1202
01:21:57,709 --> 01:21:59,540
Sorry, Rich. Coming back.

1203
01:22:01,346 --> 01:22:02,677
Coming around.

1204
01:22:05,316 --> 01:22:06,944
Why is this happening to me?

1205
01:22:07,019 --> 01:22:08,179
Coming back.

1206
01:22:12,992 --> 01:22:15,790
- Here we are.
- Stop the boat. Idiot.

1207
01:22:16,028 --> 01:22:17,655
Stop the boat!

1208
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:22,967
- Where are the brakes?
- Boats don't have brakes, Captain.

1209
01:22:23,035 --> 01:22:25,663
You're kidding. How do they stop?

1210
01:22:25,738 --> 01:22:27,137
Throw the anchor.

1211
01:22:27,206 --> 01:22:28,332
The anchor, throw it.

1212
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,465
- They're headed for us.
- Here we go.

1213
01:22:30,543 --> 01:22:32,443
Whatever you're doing, don't.

1214
01:22:34,146 --> 01:22:35,204
Sorry.

1215
01:22:39,718 --> 01:22:41,151
You broke my watch.

1216
01:22:44,023 --> 01:22:45,388
Mine still works.

1217
01:22:45,457 --> 01:22:47,652
You better put that thing
back on the dead body.

1218
01:22:47,726 --> 01:22:49,421
Drive the boat, Richard.

1219
01:22:49,495 --> 01:22:52,487
The cops are gonna take
our fat heads to jail.

1220
01:22:52,932 --> 01:22:55,765
My God. Look at them.

1221
01:22:55,834 --> 01:22:57,495
Ladies, how are you?

1222
01:22:57,903 --> 01:23:00,337
Hello, Betty.

1223
01:23:00,506 --> 01:23:03,407
God! Just once, I'd like a woman like that.

1224
01:23:03,742 --> 01:23:04,834
Let's party.

1225
01:23:10,783 --> 01:23:12,546
Turn the boat.

1226
01:23:15,955 --> 01:23:17,820
Watch the fishermen.

1227
01:23:24,997 --> 01:23:27,192
- Watch the wake!
- Duck!

1228
01:23:27,266 --> 01:23:28,961
Watch the wake, Richard!

1229
01:23:38,578 --> 01:23:40,512
This is tougher than it looks.

1230
01:23:40,647 --> 01:23:42,581
You're doing very well, Richard.

1231
01:23:42,649 --> 01:23:44,776
- Sorry I snapped at you.
- It's okay.

1232
01:23:44,851 --> 01:23:47,149
I've never been chased by a killer before.

1233
01:23:47,220 --> 01:23:49,586
It's all right. You're doing very well.

1234
01:23:51,358 --> 01:23:54,452
- Why is everybody waving at us?
- I'm popular.

1235
01:23:54,527 --> 01:23:55,516
I see.

1236
01:23:55,595 --> 01:23:57,586
Hey, Bernie, showing off again?

1237
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:03,196
Oh, God. What the hell are those things?

1238
01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:06,800
Those are obviously channel markers.

1239
01:24:07,307 --> 01:24:08,296
Obviously.

1240
01:24:08,375 --> 01:24:11,310
Okay, wise ass, do you know
what side I'm supposed to pass on?

1241
01:24:11,378 --> 01:24:14,245
That I don't know. Just stay close.
What else can happen here?

1242
01:24:14,314 --> 01:24:15,679
I've got no idea.

1243
01:24:16,249 --> 01:24:18,740
- Serpentine.
- Is that close enough?

1244
01:24:22,922 --> 01:24:24,514
Do you hear something?

1245
01:24:28,361 --> 01:24:30,056
- There it's again.
- Yeah.

1246
01:24:30,497 --> 01:24:32,761
- I wonder what that is.
- What is that?

1247
01:24:38,571 --> 01:24:40,266
- Man overboard.
- What?

1248
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:41,602
Stop the boat.

1249
01:24:44,744 --> 01:24:46,268
He's got nice form.

1250
01:24:50,717 --> 01:24:52,776
- I don't know.
- I'm trying to drive a boat.

1251
01:24:52,852 --> 01:24:55,685
- You're doing well.
- Trying to get us off this island of hell.

1252
01:24:55,755 --> 01:24:57,814
You had maybe one job to do.
Watch a dead body.

1253
01:24:57,891 --> 01:25:00,382
- Well, let's not argue about it.
- Jesus.

1254
01:25:01,494 --> 01:25:04,487
- You were the one who tied him up.
- Don't blame this all on me.

1255
01:25:04,565 --> 01:25:06,624
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1256
01:25:07,068 --> 01:25:08,797
You've lost my sunglasses.

1257
01:25:27,621 --> 01:25:29,088
What are you doing?

1258
01:25:30,524 --> 01:25:32,048
I haven't got a clue.

1259
01:25:33,728 --> 01:25:35,252
I don't believe this.

1260
01:25:35,763 --> 01:25:36,923
What?

1261
01:25:38,933 --> 01:25:40,264
We're out of gas.

1262
01:25:43,204 --> 01:25:45,695
Paddling in the Atlantic Ocean...

1263
01:25:45,973 --> 01:25:48,567
- on a dead body.
- I'm getting swimmer's ear.

1264
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:50,801
This is now the perfect weekend.

1265
01:25:51,045 --> 01:25:55,277
It started when I almost broke my leg
jumping on a moving ferry.

1266
01:25:55,616 --> 01:25:59,450
I get to this beautiful beach and my host...
Sorry, he's dead.

1267
01:26:03,557 --> 01:26:04,854
Hampton Island.

1268
01:26:06,627 --> 01:26:09,152
Checkers. Excuse me, sir.
Is this your launch?

1269
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:11,460
- Come on, let's go.
- Don't rush.

1270
01:26:14,602 --> 01:26:16,069
Come on.

1271
01:26:16,137 --> 01:26:19,265
- Can you put a little snap in it, fellows?
- Okay, Cappy.

1272
01:26:24,845 --> 01:26:26,608
Hold on, you damn fool.

1273
01:26:26,881 --> 01:26:30,544
I fell down a lighthouse.
I had a corpse wash up...

1274
01:26:30,651 --> 01:26:31,949
next to me on the shore.

1275
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:36,320
And then I find out that my dead boss
is not only a thief, he wants to kill me.

1276
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:43,627
I almost drown.

1277
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:46,732
The girl of my dreams
now thinks I'm a raving lunatic.

1278
01:26:46,802 --> 01:26:48,599
You mean what's- her-name?

1279
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:52,063
And, now, we're going back
to the house of death.

1280
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:54,301
- Great weekend, huh?
- Great weekend!

1281
01:26:57,312 --> 01:26:59,872
Just get here as fast as you can.
Thanks, Ed.

1282
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:01,139
Police is on the way.

1283
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:03,776
Can just lock ourselves in
until they get here?

1284
01:27:03,852 --> 01:27:06,252
I hate it when he stares at me like that.

1285
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:07,652
Let's go.

1286
01:27:10,325 --> 01:27:12,020
Put him in his bathroom.

1287
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:18,058
- Bernie's picked up a little weight.
- What do you expect?

1288
01:27:18,133 --> 01:27:20,158
He's been soaking in the ocean
for two hours.

1289
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:21,566
Made a damn good float though.

1290
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:27,875
Are you in here?

1291
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:43,724
It's Gwen.

1292
01:27:45,227 --> 01:27:46,455
Hi, Gwen.

1293
01:27:46,528 --> 01:27:49,258
You've got to be the weirdest guy
I've ever met.

1294
01:27:49,865 --> 01:27:51,924
You told me Bernie was dead, right?

1295
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,831
I just saw you with him.

1296
01:27:53,902 --> 01:27:55,961
What's your explanation this time?

1297
01:27:56,037 --> 01:27:58,597
I don't mean to be rude,
but get the hell out of here.

1298
01:27:58,673 --> 01:28:01,939
No, I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me what is going on.

1299
01:28:02,011 --> 01:28:03,000
Listen to me!

1300
01:28:03,079 --> 01:28:06,378
You're in danger here,
leave unless you want to get shot.

1301
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:10,114
Lomax is dead,
somebody is trying to kill us.

1302
01:28:10,186 --> 01:28:13,212
Can we stay at your house
until the cops come or what?

1303
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:17,115
It's just Bernie.

1304
01:28:20,863 --> 01:28:23,957
Gwen, listen to me.

1305
01:28:24,066 --> 01:28:27,126
We didn't do this to him.
Do we look like we could kill someone?

1306
01:28:27,203 --> 01:28:29,433
Honey, have a drink, relax. You'll be fine.

1307
01:28:29,505 --> 01:28:32,269
Let me rephrase that.
Do I look like I could kill someone?

1308
01:28:32,341 --> 01:28:34,070
What is going on in there?

1309
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:41,681
- Which one of you bastards hit me?
- Son of a bitch.

1310
01:28:43,352 --> 01:28:45,445
You want to get your butt kicked?

1311
01:28:50,526 --> 01:28:51,823
I can explain.

1312
01:29:11,314 --> 01:29:12,576
Company.

1313
01:29:16,018 --> 01:29:18,851
I didn't see anything.
I was looking at my watch.

1314
01:29:19,455 --> 01:29:20,615
I'm blind.

1315
01:29:30,801 --> 01:29:32,063
It's empty.

1316
01:29:33,170 --> 01:29:35,400
That's right. But this ain't.

1317
01:29:39,509 --> 01:29:40,567
Run!

1318
01:29:40,711 --> 01:29:41,939
Move it! This way!

1319
01:29:45,148 --> 01:29:46,172
It's locked.

1320
01:29:46,249 --> 01:29:48,649
What are you doing?
We're friends of Bernie's.

1321
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:50,414
I hate Bernie's friends.

1322
01:29:56,059 --> 01:29:57,048
This way.

1323
01:29:57,995 --> 01:29:59,485
To the bedroom.

1324
01:30:00,731 --> 01:30:02,824
Come on, let's go. Up.

1325
01:30:03,066 --> 01:30:05,500
You're dead meat, you little bastards.

1326
01:30:10,207 --> 01:30:11,834
Now I'm really mad!

1327
01:30:12,342 --> 01:30:13,707
Wait.

1328
01:30:13,777 --> 01:30:17,269
- What?
- You take Gwen, you go hide...

1329
01:30:17,347 --> 01:30:20,441
I'll let him chase me,
you try and call the cops, okay?

1330
01:30:20,651 --> 01:30:22,983
Okay? That's it? No arguments?

1331
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:26,184
I'll get you all, one by one.

1332
01:30:26,289 --> 01:30:28,416
There's no place to hide.

1333
01:30:43,173 --> 01:30:44,800
I'm gonna die.

1334
01:31:03,461 --> 01:31:05,986
You kicked me, you bastard.

1335
01:31:08,299 --> 01:31:09,994
Shit! Out of bullets.

1336
01:31:40,631 --> 01:31:42,030
Sit the hell down.

1337
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:47,701
Hang on, Lar.

1338
01:31:50,041 --> 01:31:52,669
- Coming.
- I got him.

1339
01:31:56,881 --> 01:31:58,007
Get off.

1340
01:31:58,616 --> 01:32:00,345
- Hang on, Lar.
- I got him.

1341
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:06,317
Stand up. Fight like a man.
Come on. Put them up, you chicken.

1342
01:32:09,894 --> 01:32:11,384
Watch this, Richard.

1343
01:32:21,205 --> 01:32:22,729
All right, Lar.

1344
01:32:29,815 --> 01:32:31,578
Fists of steel.

1345
01:32:33,719 --> 01:32:35,414
Bernie, let go of me.

1346
01:32:36,255 --> 01:32:38,018
I always liked you, Bernie.

1347
01:32:42,427 --> 01:32:43,792
I got it, thanks.

1348
01:32:43,962 --> 01:32:46,453
Just a little closer. Just get the two of us.

1349
01:32:46,532 --> 01:32:48,329
Get the handshake in, okay?

1350
01:32:48,567 --> 01:32:52,401
Wait a minute. I think I blinked. Did I blink?
I think I blinked a second there.

1351
01:32:52,471 --> 01:32:54,666
- He blinked.
- He blinked. I saw him.

1352
01:32:54,740 --> 01:32:56,298
Make sure he's wrapped up good.

1353
01:32:56,375 --> 01:32:57,603
Wait a minute.

1354
01:33:00,412 --> 01:33:02,505
I didn't kill him. He's not dead.

1355
01:33:03,315 --> 01:33:04,805
I tried to kill him.

1356
01:33:06,251 --> 01:33:07,946
Look at him. He's alive.

1357
01:33:09,454 --> 01:33:11,718
- He's not dead. He's alive.
- Move it.

1358
01:33:11,790 --> 01:33:13,758
That man is alive!

1359
01:33:14,893 --> 01:33:15,985
Now what?

1360
01:33:17,329 --> 01:33:18,853
Now I'm gonna take a week off.

1361
01:33:18,931 --> 01:33:21,923
You're taking a vacation?
The man who won't take a coffee break?

1362
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,560
Gwen just invited me to stay with her.
What should I say?

1363
01:33:24,636 --> 01:33:27,935
You're kidding me. You invited him?
You fool. That's fabulous.

1364
01:33:28,006 --> 01:33:30,167
You deserve it, Richard.
The company owes you.

1365
01:33:30,242 --> 01:33:32,540
Just a couple of days
until Gwen leaves for school.

1366
01:33:32,611 --> 01:33:35,341
There's plenty of room
if you want to stay, Lar.

1367
01:33:36,715 --> 01:33:40,151
Me? Oh, no, thanks.
I'll just tough it out here at Bernie's.

1368
01:33:40,219 --> 01:33:43,382
I hear the party Saturday night is
better than Friday, actually.

1369
01:33:48,627 --> 01:33:49,958
What is going on?

1370
01:33:50,629 --> 01:33:53,793
- What's happened?
- Didn't you hear? Bernie Lomax got killed.

1371
01:33:53,867 --> 01:33:55,198
- No.
- Yeah.

1372
01:33:55,268 --> 01:33:57,702
- Did you go to that party last night?
- No.

1373
01:33:57,937 --> 01:34:01,668
Lawrence, you done real good.
I'm proud of you.

1374
01:34:02,675 --> 01:34:05,644
Yeah, I did okay, huh? Surprised myself.

1375
01:34:06,713 --> 01:34:08,271
You did great, Rich.

1376
01:34:16,556 --> 01:34:19,548
Hi, Bernie. See you at the party tonight.

1377
01:34:20,093 --> 01:34:21,287
What?

1378
01:34:23,129 --> 01:34:25,324
What did she say?

1379
01:34:32,171 --> 01:34:34,332
Mister, can I bury you?

1380
01:34:36,342 --> 01:34:37,366
Great!

1381
01:34:38,305 --> 01:35:38,709
