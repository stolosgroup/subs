3
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,050
Cabin crew,
prepare for landing, thank you.

4
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:37,682
Welcome to Bangkok,
we hope you enjoy your stay.

5
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,452
Mahalo.

6
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,857
Next.

7
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,239
Next station,
Ratchaprarop Station.

8
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,971
Good evening, sir. I hope I didn't
make you wait for too long.

9
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,140
Oh, not at all, you're right on time.
Perfect, actually.

10
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,988
I hope you had a nice nap.

11
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,218
- Water?
- Ah...

12
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,364
- Thank you
- You're welcome.

13
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,726
You weren't kidding
about the traffic.

14
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,502
Believe it or not,
I was expecting much worse.

15
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,564
We're not too far away now.

16
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,481
Uh... Ahem.

17
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,506
Thank you.

18
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,314
Oh... Thank you.

19
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,389
Most people would
just toss it to the side.

20
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,427
Most people are inconsiderate.

21
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,829
This car is spotless.

22
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,368
You must really like this job.

23
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,836
Well, it's decent money.

24
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,339
Plus, I get to choose my own hours,

25
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,103
and I get to meet
a lot of interesting people.

26
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,873
- You like to drive at night?
- I have more time at night.

27
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,109
Can't it get dangerous?

28
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:46,481
Probably, but I've been lucky.

29
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,612
Plus, the app tells me where I'm being
called and where I'm heading to,

30
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,384
so it's all right.

31
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:57,386
You're a very pretty woman.
You must get propositioned all the time.

32
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:00,627
I'll be worried if they stop.

33
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,168
I'm not getting
any younger, you know.

34
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,229
I take it you're not married?

35
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:12,541
- No.
- May I ask you... why?

36
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,646
Never got around to it.

37
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,957
I have a brother, he has MS.

38
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,289
They detected it ten years ago.

39
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,419
He's 25 now.

40
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,990
He's everything to me.

41
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,435
I'm sure he is.

42
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,338
And I'm sure you're doing
everything you can.

43
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:44,535
lam.

44
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:48,207
It's just this past year...

45
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,214
It's gotten much worse.

46
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,849
Yeah.

47
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:57,321
MS can be like that.

48
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,222
A lot of people who suffer from it

49
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,885
tend to live a lot longer
than they're expected to.

50
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,630
Are you a doctor?

51
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,292
No.

52
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:11,703
But I was a field medic
a long time ago.

53
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:15,297
I know a little about a lot of things.

54
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,437
Jack of all trades, huh?

55
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,775
Master of none, that's right.

56
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:24,806
- Your English is very good.
- Well, thank you.

57
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:30,015
I studied English in college,
and that was a long time ago.

58
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:34,526
Well, I won't talk about your age
if you don't talk about my white beard.

59
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:39,989
I watch a lot of movies as well,
also YouTube videos.

60
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,091
That's how I practice my English,

61
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,900
but I still feel
like my vocabulary isn't there yet.

62
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,939
Well, you sound great to me.

63
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:52,205
Besides, you're Thai.
You don't need to speak perfect English.

64
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,045
I'm actually half. My dad's English.

65
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:59,107
But I grew up here
and lived here all my life.

66
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,912
Who knows, you know?

67
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,354
Maybe one day I'm going to be living
in a country

68
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:08,918
where they only speak English,
and no more Thai.

69
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:21,997
Well, the office building
is just up ahead.

70
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,772
- Can you pull up in the front?
- Mm-hmm.

71
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,752
All right, we're here.

72
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,616
My name is Kai.

73
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,886
In Hawaiian it means "the sea."

74
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,554
Oh, that's very beautiful.
You're from Hawaii?

75
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,620
Yes.

76
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:48,292
My name is Fha.
It means "sky" in Thai.

77
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,891
Nice to meet you.

78
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,267
Nice to meet you, Fha.

79
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,572
How's business been tonight?

80
00:12:56,643 --> 00:13:00,011
You're my first customer.
I just started my shift.

81
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,606
- If you don't mind my asking...
- Mm-hmm?

82
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:06,675
How much do you make
on an average Friday night?

83
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:12,748
I would say 1,500 baht,
and 2,000 on a good night.

84
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,660
Sixty dollars?

85
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:18,129
Yeah, I think so, yes.

86
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,896
I have an offer for you.

87
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:25,100
If you decide to take it,
you'll have to turn off the app.

88
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,441
Okay.

89
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:33,810
I have four more stops
after this one, all in the city.

90
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:42,087
One-thousand dollars,
that's the deposit.

91
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,317
You can quit anytime, take the money.

92
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,520
But if you decide
to stay with me until the end,

93
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,858
I'll give you $5,000 in cash.

94
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,166
You don't have to do anything.

95
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,694
You don't even have to get out of the car
unless you want to.

96
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:02,138
I just need you to drive for me.

97
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:09,976
I need to go up and talk with a lawyer.
Wait for me here.

98
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:14,384
When I get back,
I'll answer any questions you may have.

99
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:15,977
All right?

100
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,889
Thank you.

101
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,029
Thank me at the end.

102
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,524
Hello.

103
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,780
- Forty-third floor.
- Thank you.

104
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,249
You're welcome.

105
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,534
- Good evening, Mr. Kahale.
- Good evening.

106
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,971
- How was your flight?
- It was quick.

107
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,532
That's nice. Khun Cha Cha
is actually waiting for you.

108
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,479
Thank you.

109
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,573
Welcome to Bangkok, Mr. Kahale.

110
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,518
Thank you so much, Khun Cha Cha.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

111
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,987
- Not at all. Please, have a seat.
- Thank you.

112
00:15:58,658 --> 00:15:59,989
You have a beautiful office.

113
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:04,086
Seems like you've done quite well,
especially for being so young.

114
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,460
Yes, I have.

115
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,296
So please, tell me.
How I can be of service?

116
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,165
You were a bit vague on the phone,

117
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,432
something about an accident
and a family member?

118
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,805
Yes.

119
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:20,335
Actually, more than just one family
member, the whole family.

120
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,749
Let me show you something.

121
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,059
Thank you, Khun Cha Cha.
I'll see you tomorrow.

122
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,136
Thank you again for waiting.

123
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,265
Not a problem at all.
Did everything go okay?

124
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,774
- Very well.
- Good.

125
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,574
I'll be back tomorrow around 4:00 pm
to follow up with details.

126
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:01,807
All right.

127
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,576
- Would you please do me a small favor?
- Of course.

128
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,913
It's a bit unusual.

129
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:11,583
Uh, can you please ask for a taxi,
and specifically, a pink one?

130
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,386
I know it's silly.

131
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,826
But I saw a lot of the pink taxis
at the airport,

132
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,124
and with all my travels,
I've never ridden in one.

133
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,062
- Sure, yeah.
- Okay, thank you.

134
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,658
Now, please let them know
there'll be two stops:

135
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,032
one at a 24-hour supermarket,

136
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,402
and then at my hotel,
the Hotel Millennium.

137
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:28,770
Okay, that's not a problem at all.

138
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,638
It'll take maybe about ten minutes.

139
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,302
Would you waiting here? Or...

140
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,971
- Uh, actually, I prefer waiting outside.
- Okay.

141
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:38,278
Um, I think my body could use
some fresh, non-airconditioned air.

142
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:40,546
- Yeah, okay. Great.
- Thank you again.

143
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,088
Have a good evening.

144
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:52,292
Thank you.

145
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,666
Oh, my gosh, you scared me.

146
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,768
Sorry, you should lock the doors.

147
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,439
Everything went well?

148
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:13,110
- The lawyer was very cooperative.
- Well...

149
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,145
I don't like lawyers.

150
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:18,987
It's okay, I don't either.

151
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,127
So, where next?

152
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,894
Thonglor Police Station, please.

153
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:33,100
I know, first a lawyer, now police.

154
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,436
Mm-hmm. Are you in trouble?

155
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,968
No, it's nothing like that.

156
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:45,848
The lawyer and the police officer
were working on a case

157
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:49,512
that involved my daughter
and her family, recently.

158
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,456
I'm here to repay them.

159
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,224
We're gonna get there around 11:00 pm.

160
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,320
Will you be able to see them then?

161
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,327
I'm sure that won't be a problem.

162
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:05,660
Man, you fall asleep so easily.

163
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,757
Every moving vehicle.

164
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,962
I find I like the motion.

165
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:15,770
What do you like to do
when you're not...

166
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:19,573
driving or taking care
of your brother?

167
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:21,669
I don't know.

168
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,977
I don't really have much time
to do anything else.

169
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,314
You must like something.

170
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,450
Well, what about you?

171
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:38,095
Fishing. I like fishing.

172
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,428
- Fishing?
- Fishing.

173
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:44,059
Fishing sounds so boring.

174
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,570
Have you tried it?

175
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:49,836
No, but I know what it is,
and it looks boring.

176
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,637
Fish are like people.

177
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:57,580
- Like people?
- Like people.

178
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,118
How?

179
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:03,520
Well,
there are some fish that are...

180
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:09,290
really dumb and easy to catch.

181
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:14,697
Others are extremely smart,

182
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,668
and much more difficult to catch.

183
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:24,166
And then there are the rare,
dangerous ones...

184
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:29,171
that can hurt or even kill you.

185
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:42,989
I actually find it relaxing...
the act of fishing.

186
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,731
I don't really care
whether I catch a fish or not.

187
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:54,170
I just like standing on a beach...

188
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,135
watching the waves roll in...

189
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:02,474
listening to them crash on the sand...

190
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:08,949
feeling the warm breeze on my face...

191
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,021
smelling the salt...

192
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,363
and the scent of flowers in the air.

193
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:25,460
That's how I fish.

194
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,539
That's what my grandfather taught me.

195
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:35,842
That's what I like.

196
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:40,045
It's heaven to me.

197
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:47,422
It sounds very peaceful.

198
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,756
You should try it.

199
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,762
Maybe one day.

200
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:21,192
We're here.
Do you want me to park in front?

201
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,627
- Yeah, park in front.
- Okay.

202
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,405
I'll be back soon.

203
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:19,111
What the fuck?

204
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,280
I know you speak English.

205
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:25,248
This is for Lisa.

206
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,581
Who the fuck is...

207
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,510
You're still here.

208
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:42,411
To be honest,
I thought about leaving.

209
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,113
You saw I left the bag.

210
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,190
Did you open it?

211
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,558
But you know there's cash inside?

212
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,769
Was it a test?

213
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:13,044
Oh, my God!
What happened to your head?

214
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:20,950
I tripped. Hit the wall.

215
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:43,138
You need stitches,
maybe three or four.

216
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,580
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

217
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:48,484
Are you sure? That's a deep cut.

218
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:49,986
I'm sure.

219
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:52,713
All right.

220
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,559
Breathe.

221
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,894
And, no, it wasn't a test.

222
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,803
Everything in life
is about making choices.

223
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,610
I chose to leave the bag.

224
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,713
You chose not to take it.

225
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:30,027
Life is about making choices
and dealing with those consequences.

226
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,554
You understand that?

227
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,899
I understand.

228
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,137
Are you hungry?

229
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:51,343
Let's get something to eat.
We have some time.

230
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,316
What do you feel like eating?

231
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:57,653
Something local.

232
00:30:57,723 --> 00:30:59,851
Well, I know just the place.

233
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,224
Okay.

234
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,564
I mean, come on, babe,

235
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:12,467
who fucking kills a lawyer
on a Friday night?

236
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,508
Stop it! You're on the scene?

237
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:19,306
I'm actually just walking in now.

238
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:22,245
Kai Kahale, American-Hawaiian.

239
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:26,045
Just arrived today, he came straight here.
He had an appointment.

240
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,849
She led him to the Vic's office,

241
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,014
next thing you know he asks for a taxi,

242
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:34,719
she finds her boss shot dead.
Boom, a bullet to the head.

243
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:37,353
He walked out of here
as if it was nothing.

244
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:38,897
Guards confirmed it as well.

245
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,890
Like I said, cold-blooded.

246
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,698
Body slumped over.

247
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:49,366
Blood splattered everywhere
directly behind her.

248
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:55,210
This Kai Kahale sat directly
in front of her and shot her.

249
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,611
I'm looking at his ID.

250
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:58,342
Seems to be real.

251
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,511
Arrived this evening, 5:00 pm,
from Haneda.

252
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:05,454
TG 614, business class.

253
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,948
Connecting flight.

254
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,721
No alias?

255
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:15,461
Kai Kahale, born 1954. Retired.

256
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:18,127
Worked as a supervisor
at a coffee plantation.

257
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,127
Big one, it seems.

258
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:24,033
He shot her with a silencer, one shot.

259
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:27,272
He's definitely not an office worker.

260
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:32,249
Get his picture out. Send it out
to the airports and the borders.

261
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:34,149
Who knows? Maybe we'll get lucky.

262
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:38,653
All right, get as much information
as you can

263
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:42,853
and drop me off at the office.
I left my car there.

264
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:51,666
Uncle, two of the usual, please.

265
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:52,999
Sure.

266
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,835
What would you like to drink?

267
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:59,343
Uh...?

268
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,173
I'd recommend you
the chrysanthemum tea.

269
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,475
It's really refreshing. Yeah?

270
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:05,072
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

271
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:12,586
Uncle,
two chrysanthemum tea, please.

272
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,182
Go ahead.

273
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,454
- Thank you.
- Customer or boyfriend?

274
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:19,020
- He's a customer.
- That's good.

275
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,531
Because he looks even older than your Dad.

276
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,036
Here you go.

277
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,537
Thank you.

278
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,172
You're a regular here?

279
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:36,010
Yeah, I try to come here two
or three times a week, depends on my ride.

280
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,208
Good?

281
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,585
Good.

282
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:47,248
Can I ask you a question now?

283
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:49,890
Anything.

284
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,591
Six thousand dollars
is a lot of money,

285
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:59,034
and anyone would do it
for half or even less.

286
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,538
Probably.

287
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,632
But why 6,000?

288
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:10,177
Because I wanted you to say yes.

289
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:15,585
And I wanted you to want to do it
and be happy doing it.

290
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,715
Okay...

291
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:24,020
But, to be honest, I can just take half.
It's more than enough for me.

292
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:28,191
No, we made a deal. We shook on it.

293
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:33,027
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

294
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:38,138
Okay. Thank you.

295
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,472
You're welcome.

296
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,878
As I said, thank me after.

297
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,145
After what?

298
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,494
Oh, no, no, wait.
You need to put some of this in first.

299
00:34:58,496 --> 00:34:59,930
Some nuts.

300
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:03,935
Some... I don't know
what you call this in English.

301
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,271
But it will make it taste good.

302
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,542
Do you eat chili?

303
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,975
I do.

304
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,404
Thank you.

305
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,609
And then you need this,
this is like the secret recipe.

306
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:22,051
- Fish sauce.
- Fish sauce?

307
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,483
Okay, done, dig in.

308
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,393
Bon appétit.

309
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,089
- Bon appétit.
- Merci.

310
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:36,924
Mmm, smells so good.

311
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,114
It's good, right?

312
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:51,605
It's really good.

313
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:54,118
Great.

314
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,153
So, what's after this?

315
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:03,695
After.

316
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,594
We have a stop at a club.

317
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:11,296
- Mm-hmm.
- Then we go to a hospital.

318
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,360
And the last stop is at a house.

319
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,803
You're meeting five people today?

320
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,367
No, seven.

321
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,305
And you want to know why.

322
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:27,682
Yeah, sorry.

323
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,322
It's okay, human nature.

324
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,927
Not too long ago...

325
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:43,527
my daughter and her family
came to Thailand.

326
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,998
They got into an accident.

327
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:53,542
The people I'll be seeing tonight
were involved with it.

328
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,077
I see.

329
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:58,275
Are they okay?

330
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:02,281
No.

331
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:05,787
They died.

332
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:13,894
Oh.

333
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:18,431
I'm... I'm sorry.

334
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,230
It's okay.

335
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:46,462
I was recently in an accident as well.

336
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:56,501
White family...

337
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,101
They died too.

338
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,846
Drunk driver.

339
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:14,290
Happens everywhere in the world.

340
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:21,894
They have a kid.

341
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:25,169
A child.

342
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:42,952
I'm sorry.

343
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:18,685
Thank you for bringing me here
and for paying for dinner.

344
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,282
- It was excellent.
- You're welcome.

345
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,387
And, uh, I'm sorry
about the not so happy conversation.

346
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:27,191
It's okay, it's life.

347
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:30,964
Uh...

348
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:34,569
Do you know the Ibiza night club?

349
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:39,243
Yeah. Is that our next destination?

350
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:41,676
- Yes.
- Okay.

351
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:05,396
A cross. You're not Buddhist?

352
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:07,935
No.

353
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,140
I'm not Christian either.

354
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,744
Are you atheist?

355
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,715
What's atheist?

356
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:21,685
Atheist is someone who
does not believe in religion.

357
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,687
I believe in faith.

358
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,694
I believe it's good
that people have faith.

359
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,287
Do you pray?

360
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,396
Yeah.

361
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,531
May I ask to whom?

362
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:44,602
To my parents.

363
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:53,007
So why the cross?

364
00:40:57,355 --> 00:40:59,756
It belonged to someone I knew.

365
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:04,623
I kept it as a reminder.

366
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:08,661
Good or bad reminder?

367
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,166
Good.

368
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,670
Of something bad I did.

369
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,171
You did something bad?

370
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:22,774
Yeah.

371
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,248
Did anyone get hurt?

372
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:29,981
I don't think so.

373
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,184
But you feel bad.

374
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:38,919
Yeah, I feel...

375
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,623
I-I don't know how to explain.

376
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:46,160
Guilt.

377
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:49,201
You feel guilty.

378
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,479
Guilt is good.

379
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:04,689
It reminds us to do good.

380
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,186
That's why I kept the cross.

381
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:39,816
Drive around. Stay close.

382
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:42,690
I'll call, don't pick up the phone.

383
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:46,995
Meet me over there, past the entrance,

384
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,260
within five minutes of the phone call.

385
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:51,964
Okay.

386
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,131
Okay.

387
00:45:27,692 --> 00:45:29,091
What the fuck, man?

388
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,854
- Dominic!
- Holy fuck!

389
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:34,592
You messed up. Stay put.

390
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:37,327
What... What do you...
What do you want?

391
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:41,895
You killed a family with your Porsche.
Do you remember?

392
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:46,771
Do you remember?!

393
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:50,211
- Yes, yes, yes, yes...
- I-I remember.

394
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:52,841
Just don't... don't... don't do anything.

395
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,554
Stand up.

396
00:45:56,621 --> 00:45:59,249
Wait, no, don't... Just don't kill...

397
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:01,792
Jesus Christ!

398
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:04,486
- Stand up!
- Okay... I didn't do anything!

399
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:10,792
Do you want...
Do you want my car?

400
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:12,835
Take it, man, it's yours.

401
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:24,032
- What happened?
- Drive.

402
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:27,406
- What did you do?
- Drive, please.

403
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:34,484
- Where's the nearest hospital?
- Are you hurt?

404
00:47:34,552 --> 00:47:37,021
I'm okay. Hospital?

405
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:38,782
There's one a few minutes away.

406
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,483
Take us there, please.

407
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:43,820
Please!

408
00:48:02,513 --> 00:48:03,844
What are you thinking?

409
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:06,349
I'm thinking there's more.

410
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:10,251
I'm thinking
that it's going to escalate.

411
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:13,915
And I'm thinking he's not
sleeping in a hotel somewhere.

412
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:16,049
We need to get everything
on these three people.

413
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,959
Wife's on it.

414
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,929
She should have something for us soon.

415
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:23,795
Isn't your son like a week old?

416
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:28,566
- Nine days.
- Talk about a slave driver.

417
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,698
You met my wife, right?

418
00:48:32,176 --> 00:48:34,201
You know she doesn't rest.

419
00:48:40,885 --> 00:48:42,410
Speak.

420
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:47,851
All right, thanks.

421
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,360
Seems like you're right again.

422
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:52,795
- Where?
- Ibiza Night Club.

423
00:48:52,897 --> 00:48:55,093
Twenty-three-year-old,
shot through the chest.

424
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:57,759
Witness all claim old Asian man.

425
00:48:57,868 --> 00:49:00,269
- All right.
- Wait, boss, there's more.

426
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:03,136
The kid, he's not dead.

427
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,107
He's being transported
to the hospital as we speak.

428
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:09,841
You go to the club, get a positive ID,
take a look around,

429
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,939
- and I'll head over to the hospital.
- Copy that.

430
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:23,286
Can I have a tissue, please?

431
00:49:30,768 --> 00:49:32,202
Thank you.

432
00:50:13,878 --> 00:50:15,846
I'm not going to kill you.

433
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:20,349
Nothing has changed.

434
00:50:21,986 --> 00:50:24,318
Our deal is still the deal.

435
00:50:26,557 --> 00:50:31,586
It wasn't an accident, right?
Me picking you up tonight?

436
00:50:34,565 --> 00:50:36,693
No, it wasn't.

437
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:41,168
I know where you live.

438
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:44,663
I knew your routine.

439
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:52,307
Why?

440
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:01,321
The family that died in your car?

441
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,363
That was my daughter...

442
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:10,196
her husband...

443
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:16,863
and her five-year-old daughter.

444
00:51:21,045 --> 00:51:22,774
My grandchild.

445
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:38,422
You gonna kill me?

446
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:50,473
It was possible... yes.

447
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:56,778
It was your car, your signature
on the witness sheet.

448
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:11,023
I swear, I don't want to kill you.

449
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:13,855
I don't even want to hurt you.

450
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:22,365
Can you give me
a bottle of water, please?

451
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:36,782
Thank you.

452
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:43,357
Drink it.

453
00:52:57,608 --> 00:52:59,633
What changed your mind?

454
00:53:03,781 --> 00:53:05,044
That.

455
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:16,215
I gave that to my daughter...

456
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:26,903
on her 18th birthday.

457
00:54:00,037 --> 00:54:04,702
Anyone who can live
with as much guilt as you do...

458
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:09,873
over making a choice...

459
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:13,115
You had no option.

460
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:20,620
That person has a good heart.

461
00:54:52,923 --> 00:54:54,550
You're going to kill him?

462
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,595
Yes.

463
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:33,664
What kind of fucking place is this?

464
00:55:35,232 --> 00:55:38,202
- Is this you?
- What the fuck do you mean?

465
00:55:38,302 --> 00:55:41,897
Is this one of your business associates?
Did you have some sort of deal go bad?

466
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,029
Fuck you!

467
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,539
Fuck you for even thinking that.

468
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:47,201
How can I not think it?

469
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:49,643
How many times
have you put us in danger?

470
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,340
- Really?
- Yeah.

471
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:54,213
How many times
have you been shot at?

472
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:57,117
How many times has Dom?

473
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:01,883
That's right, none.

474
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:05,055
I have never put us in danger.

475
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:09,656
The life I provide you with,

476
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:13,465
ninety-nine percent of the population
would kill for.

477
00:56:14,638 --> 00:56:17,369
So, I would appreciate some respect!

478
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:24,009
The fact that I let you fuck
your little hussies is respect enough.

479
00:56:25,282 --> 00:56:28,343
What, you think I don't know?

480
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:32,582
You think I'm some farang who's blind
and doesn't know what's going on?

481
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:37,286
Nothing you do goes by me.

482
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:43,424
I can take my son and walk away
with everything you got.

483
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:47,870
I know all your dirty little secrets.

484
00:56:47,938 --> 00:56:50,532
So the fact that I'm still standing here,

485
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:53,201
that's all the respect
you're going to get.

486
00:56:55,012 --> 00:56:57,003
And if my son dies...

487
00:56:58,849 --> 00:57:00,578
I swear to God,

488
00:57:00,684 --> 00:57:04,848
you'll regret the day
that you ever laid eyes on me.

489
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:58,992
He's a lucky boy.

490
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:03,639
The bullet went clean through.

491
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:06,039
All they had to do was clean his wounds
and stitch him up.

492
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,534
He's gonna be okay.

493
00:59:26,163 --> 00:59:30,566
You're fired...
useless piece of shit!

494
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:36,569
You fucking shot my son?!

495
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:39,932
Wait, wait, wait!

496
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:41,602
What is this all about?

497
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:46,105
Listen, anything you want.
I have so much money.

498
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:53,656
Your money paid for everything.

499
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:58,620
Made my son-in-law into a criminal.

500
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:01,896
Covered your son's crimes!

501
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:08,295
Yeah, you understand now.

502
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:12,798
I did it to protect my son.

503
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:15,743
Something any father would do.

504
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,884
Me too.

505
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:30,026
The apple never falls
far from the tree.

506
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:33,190
He's just a kid.

507
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:01,315
You're old enough to kill...

508
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,453
you're old enough to die.

509
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:47,594
- Well, what do you got?
- Hurt boobies.

510
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,433
Like father, like son.

511
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:56,206
I found connections between the cops
and the lawyers in over 20 cases,

512
01:01:56,279 --> 01:02:00,876
from small traffic violations
to much more serious crimes.

513
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:02,385
Example?

514
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,647
Drug and human trafficking,
possession.

515
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,190
You name it,
they worked on it together.

516
01:02:07,257 --> 01:02:10,693
And for every instance,
the defendants walked.

517
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,730
There was only one case
involving the Davis family, though.

518
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:15,059
Okay.

519
01:02:15,165 --> 01:02:18,032
A few months ago,
the son was involved in an accident.

520
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:22,368
Four people died and one was injured,
including a five-year-old girl.

521
01:02:22,439 --> 01:02:24,430
A British family.

522
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:27,374
- Not American?
- No, British.

523
01:02:27,444 --> 01:02:30,607
- The Coopers.
- And the son got acquitted.

524
01:02:30,714 --> 01:02:34,480
Turns out the husband
was the one who was driving the taxi.

525
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:39,215
Paid the driver extra, said he always
wanted to drive in Bangkok.

526
01:02:39,289 --> 01:02:42,782
Got confused,
drove right onto coming traffic.

527
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:45,156
And ran directly into the son.

528
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:47,924
Yeah, that's the official version.

529
01:02:47,998 --> 01:02:50,660
No thanks to our two dead friends,
I'm sure.

530
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,166
Right.

531
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:55,060
Your thoughts?

532
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:58,403
My thoughts are the same.
The law is the law.

533
01:02:58,475 --> 01:03:01,001
Vigilante justice is still homicide.

534
01:03:12,055 --> 01:03:13,284
Drop it!

535
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:16,953
Now!

536
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:22,892
Okay, man, relax.

537
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,299
I'm putting down the gun.

538
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:32,805
Look, I know everything.

539
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:35,469
The son, he killed your family, right?

540
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,611
Son or daughter?

541
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:44,042
My daughter.

542
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:49,558
I understand, but no one
needs to get hurt anymore.

543
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:53,459
Oh, yes, one more person.
Then it's done.

544
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:57,194
The only person
that is gonna get hurt is you...

545
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:00,329
if you continue this.

546
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:01,734
Put down the gun.

547
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:05,172
Come on, man, let's handle this
the right way.

548
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:06,367
The legal way.

549
01:04:06,476 --> 01:04:10,106
Yeah, that didn't work out too well
for my daughter and her family.

550
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:13,275
And that's on us,
and I apologize.

551
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,045
But there's
good and bad everywhere.

552
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:16,380
Yeah.

553
01:04:16,486 --> 01:04:19,854
They were bad people
pretending to be good.

554
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:21,788
You are good doing bad,

555
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,451
and two wrongs
don't make it right, man.

556
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,494
Nothing will make this right,
not even this.

557
01:04:25,562 --> 01:04:28,293
- So why are we doing this?
- Because I can.

558
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,856
Because no one else did.

559
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:35,666
Don't.

560
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:38,203
I don't want to shoot you,

561
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:40,606
I don't want to shoot her,
but I will.

562
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,109
Stay there.

563
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,382
Go, go, go!

564
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:53,718
Go.

565
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:00,753
No!

566
01:05:00,864 --> 01:05:02,389
Kai!

567
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:05,264
No, fuckin' stay there!

568
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:07,029
Kai, you're not gonna shoot me.

569
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:09,162
- I will shoot you!
- Let her go.

570
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:11,901
I'm not letting her go.
I'm not letting her go!

571
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:14,102
Kai, please let her go.
She didn't do anything.

572
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,336
I don't want to hurt her!

573
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:18,109
I don't have a gun. Kai, calm down.

574
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:20,581
That's not you,
you're not that type of man.

575
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:23,345
- They're already dead.
- Stay there!

576
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:27,254
Kai, they're all dead.
Let her go, please.

577
01:05:27,357 --> 01:05:30,088
- I'm begging you.
- I'm gonna shoot you.

578
01:05:30,193 --> 01:05:31,752
I'm gonna shoot you.

579
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:32,919
I'll shoot you.

580
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:35,225
Kai, let her go!

581
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:39,098
You want to shoot me, then shoot me,
but you fucking let her go now!

582
01:05:39,202 --> 01:05:41,569
That's not you, Kai!

583
01:05:41,638 --> 01:05:44,300
Let her go! Okay?

584
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:47,433
I'm a father, just like you.

585
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:51,640
Just like you, I'm a father, I understand,
but please, just let her go.

586
01:05:52,649 --> 01:05:54,447
Please.

587
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:58,351
Kai... Kai, listen to me.

588
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:01,658
Let her go.

589
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:14,398
No!

590
01:06:15,939 --> 01:06:19,569
That's on you! That's on you!

591
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,413
No!

592
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:29,111
Help! Help me!

593
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:31,483
Officer down! Two down!

594
01:06:31,588 --> 01:06:33,989
Come on, bro, hang in there,
hang in there.

595
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,618
I didn't kill her, right?

596
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:39,958
No, you didn't, she's good.
She's going to make it. Okay.

597
01:06:57,914 --> 01:06:59,507
Fuck!

598
01:08:44,988 --> 01:08:47,320
Fuck.

599
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:16,282
This is a surprise.

600
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:17,547
Where are you?

601
01:09:18,588 --> 01:09:19,953
I don't know.

602
01:09:20,023 --> 01:09:22,151
There are cops everywhere.

603
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,456
Yeah, I know.

604
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:27,861
Didn't go quite as well as planned.

605
01:09:28,865 --> 01:09:30,299
Send me your location.

606
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:33,461
They don't know my car, I'm close.

607
01:09:33,536 --> 01:09:35,129
I'll come pick you up.

608
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:40,038
All right.

609
01:09:40,143 --> 01:09:42,373
Park in the alley.

610
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:44,037
I'll see you when you pull up.

611
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:30,018
Stay low.

612
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:48,572
Thank you.

613
01:10:54,217 --> 01:10:55,810
Where are we going?

614
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,285
You're bleeding, we need to fix you.

615
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:01,484
I'm fine.

616
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:06,394
Bullet went through.

617
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:09,762
- How do you know?
- I felt it.

618
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:12,267
But I can't go to a hospital.

619
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:14,770
I'm serious.

620
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:18,467
The detective, he's good.

621
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:21,976
It won't take him long before he figures
out who the last target is.

622
01:11:22,078 --> 01:11:23,705
And the last target himself?

623
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:27,709
He's gonna know what's going on
in the next hour...

624
01:11:28,718 --> 01:11:30,379
and disappear.

625
01:11:31,988 --> 01:11:35,117
We're not going to the hospital,
don't worry.

626
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:36,988
It's not too far away.

627
01:11:56,546 --> 01:11:58,036
Thank you.

628
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:21,328
How are you holding up?

629
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:25,668
Better.

630
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:33,540
You did your best.

631
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:35,984
I heard everything.

632
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:39,288
Kid was 29.

633
01:12:42,058 --> 01:12:44,049
He shot a nurse.

634
01:12:45,061 --> 01:12:46,995
She was 24.

635
01:12:53,002 --> 01:12:54,663
He's not a kid.

636
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:58,037
There's another target.

637
01:13:00,176 --> 01:13:03,339
I know. That's why I'm here.

638
01:13:06,449 --> 01:13:08,440
You remember the accident?

639
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:12,112
There was one person
who was injured, didn't die.

640
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:15,715
Her name was Vanida Hoffsted.

641
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:18,260
She was a Grab driver.

642
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:20,386
The girl that testified at the trial.

643
01:13:20,463 --> 01:13:21,521
Yeah.

644
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:23,965
Earlier tonight,

645
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:28,435
she picked up someone
from On Nut Road around 8:00 pm.

646
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:33,566
Two hours later,
dropped him off on Silom Road.

647
01:13:33,676 --> 01:13:35,701
Near the law offices?

648
01:13:38,114 --> 01:13:40,276
Well, where is she now?

649
01:13:40,383 --> 01:13:42,579
She turned her app off after that.

650
01:13:42,685 --> 01:13:45,848
She was driving a new Volvo.
I have the plates.

651
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:47,686
We can track her.

652
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:50,055
It'll show up if she's on the road.

653
01:13:50,126 --> 01:13:53,562
- Put everything on it.
- I already ordered it.

654
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:56,528
Of course you did, babe.

655
01:14:00,136 --> 01:14:02,901
- You saw the photos.
- Stop.

656
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,265
I know you're a good-hearted person...

657
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:10,004
but he's still
a cold-blooded murderer.

658
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:13,243
He never was one.

659
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:16,684
He served in the military;
two tours, 40 years ago.

660
01:14:18,154 --> 01:14:21,784
After that, not even a single blemish.

661
01:14:21,857 --> 01:14:24,349
Not even a traffic violation.

662
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,121
He's still a murderer.

663
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:29,794
He's also a father.

664
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:31,731
Just like you.

665
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:36,962
What are you trying to say?
I should just drop everything?

666
01:14:37,073 --> 01:14:40,566
No, but I know you.

667
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:44,011
You just watched your young partner
get shot and die.

668
01:14:44,113 --> 01:14:46,411
You're operating
on emotions right now.

669
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:50,909
I'm just here to give you some balance.

670
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:57,988
You're a good man, like him.

671
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:01,992
I don't want to see you do a bad thing.

672
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:05,365
Two wrongs don't make a right.

673
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:08,864
I gotta go work.

674
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:15,701
Look at him.

675
01:15:21,384 --> 01:15:22,909
Now look at me.

676
01:15:26,389 --> 01:15:28,380
You're a good cop, babe.

677
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:34,558
But remember, you're a father now,
first and foremost.

678
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:38,625
Then a husband, then a cop.

679
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:47,373
- I love you.
- Ditto.

680
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:21,203
Oh, my God.

681
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,232
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

682
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:50,638
Uh, do you have
some saline or some alcohol

683
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:52,104
- or something first?
- Oh, right, yes.

684
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:53,642
Oh, fuck.

685
01:16:55,211 --> 01:16:57,646
- All right. Oh, thanks.
- Sorry.

686
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:01,907
Oh, my gosh, that's a lot of blood.

687
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:14,091
Okay...

688
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:20,466
Are you ready?

689
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:23,468
Okay, this is gonna hurt.

690
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:50,466
Why'd you come back?

691
01:17:52,535 --> 01:17:54,128
Sorry.

692
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:08,050
I had a chance to correct
the wrong that I did.

693
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:11,953
So I made a choice.

694
01:18:16,392 --> 01:18:20,158
You said we live with the consequences
of our own choice.

695
01:18:22,398 --> 01:18:24,492
I made a bad one before.

696
01:18:27,403 --> 01:18:31,465
You didn't have a choice.
I know that now.

697
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:36,235
Ow.

698
01:18:36,345 --> 01:18:39,337
Okay.

699
01:18:46,522 --> 01:18:51,016
They gave me two million baht...
and this car.

700
01:18:57,566 --> 01:19:00,558
They told me to say
that I wasn't the one who was driving.

701
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:05,330
That our car hit the other car.

702
01:19:10,346 --> 01:19:12,280
If I didn't take the offer...

703
01:19:13,716 --> 01:19:16,276
I believe that they were
probably going to kill me.

704
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:19,477
Yes.

705
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:22,288
They would have.

706
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,060
I spent most of my money
on my brother.

707
01:19:28,397 --> 01:19:31,799
Paid in advance for his hospital expenses.

708
01:19:32,968 --> 01:19:35,062
There's not much left now.

709
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:44,272
Well, turn around,
you've got one more to go.

710
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:55,585
Ooh.

711
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,355
This is gonna hurt more.

712
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:10,303
All right, last one. Take a deep breath.

713
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:21,346
Thank you.

714
01:20:22,518 --> 01:20:24,816
It's gonna leave a big scar.

715
01:20:25,854 --> 01:20:28,516
It's okay. It's a good reminder.

716
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:31,020
Of what, tonight?

717
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:36,121
Of you. Jack of all trades.

718
01:20:45,274 --> 01:20:48,335
I actually have one more reason
why I came back.

719
01:21:00,289 --> 01:21:02,690
I started driving two years ago.

720
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:08,326
Before this, I used to work
in hotels and restaurants.

721
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:14,799
I meet a lot of foreigners
everywhere I work.

722
01:21:17,005 --> 01:21:22,910
All the foreigners,
they see me, they like me.

723
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:27,778
They offered money
for me to sleep with them.

724
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:33,714
But I never take it.

725
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:37,784
You understand?

726
01:21:45,534 --> 01:21:51,405
You're the first man
that I've met... in my life

727
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:53,134
that's showed me respect.

728
01:21:55,811 --> 01:22:01,648
Who actually gave me
respect for what I do, my work.

729
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:04,151
Not for what I look like.

730
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:13,261
That's why I came back.

731
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:27,140
That's the nicest thing anyone
has said to me since... my wife.

732
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:31,973
It's the truth.

733
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:35,641
Makes it nicer.

734
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:42,320
Stay here.

735
01:22:54,736 --> 01:22:55,897
Hold this.

736
01:22:58,607 --> 01:23:02,635
There's $4,000 cash in this bag.

737
01:23:04,947 --> 01:23:06,312
It's yours.

738
01:23:08,116 --> 01:23:09,743
Do you know Bitcoin?

739
01:23:11,353 --> 01:23:12,684
Bit... coin.

740
01:23:12,788 --> 01:23:15,120
Yeah, I think so.

741
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:17,090
You know it's money?

742
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:19,253
Like electronic money.

743
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:22,491
I read something online,
but I'm not sure.

744
01:23:22,564 --> 01:23:26,125
Okay, it's not hard to find out about.

745
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:29,364
Inside that bag is a hard drive.

746
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:33,540
My life savings.

747
01:23:33,642 --> 01:23:37,636
One-million, three-hundred
and eighty-nine thousand dollars.

748
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:41,309
It's yours.

749
01:23:43,252 --> 01:23:45,744
- No, no, no, no, I cannot take this.
- No, no, no. Listen to me.

750
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,323
- No, no, I cannot. No.
- Listen to me. Listen to me.

751
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:50,984
I converted it to bitcoin.

752
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:53,722
I didn't know what else to do.

753
01:23:53,829 --> 01:23:58,426
Uh, I was thinking, maybe
I could donate it to charity afterwards,

754
01:23:58,534 --> 01:24:01,834
but there is no afterwards for me.

755
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:04,832
What do you mean?

756
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:10,911
I mean, the last guy
is different from the others.

757
01:24:11,013 --> 01:24:13,345
He's much more dangerous.

758
01:24:13,415 --> 01:24:14,712
Much smarter.

759
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:16,410
Better guarded.

760
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:19,547
So you think you cannot win?

761
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:23,752
It was never about winning for me.

762
01:24:25,093 --> 01:24:29,690
Even if I survive, I'll go to prison.

763
01:24:29,765 --> 01:24:31,699
I should go to prison.

764
01:24:32,868 --> 01:24:35,200
But I can't go there, you understand?

765
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:43,005
I understand.

766
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:49,374
So you must take this.

767
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:55,183
Because if you take this, you win.

768
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:59,721
And if you win, I win.

769
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:05,390
You take your brother
and you get some passports.

770
01:25:06,702 --> 01:25:10,297
And you take him to some country
that doesn't speak Thai,

771
01:25:10,405 --> 01:25:12,373
if that's what you really want.

772
01:25:14,576 --> 01:25:15,737
Okay?

773
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,811
Okay.

774
01:25:33,862 --> 01:25:35,193
Thank you.

775
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:42,769
You're welcome.

776
01:26:02,524 --> 01:26:04,014
Who is this man?

777
01:26:06,862 --> 01:26:08,387
He's Japanese.

778
01:26:09,965 --> 01:26:13,162
- Like Yakuza?
- No.

779
01:26:14,403 --> 01:26:15,893
But he works with them.

780
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:20,040
He works with anyone
who can pay his price.

781
01:26:20,142 --> 01:26:23,373
Which is... very high.

782
01:26:23,478 --> 01:26:24,968
To do what?

783
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:28,612
To solve problems.

784
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:31,012
Like?

785
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:35,820
Like, if you kill someone

786
01:26:35,891 --> 01:26:38,189
and you need to get rid of the body.

787
01:26:38,293 --> 01:26:42,821
If you get arrested
for drunk driving, killing a family...

788
01:26:43,832 --> 01:26:45,630
he can fix it.

789
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:51,301
He's a really bad man, then.

790
01:26:52,908 --> 01:26:54,808
One of the worst.

791
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:58,506
A type of person who can do
a lot of bad things

792
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:00,639
and not get dirty for it.

793
01:27:02,818 --> 01:27:05,344
Well, you seem to know a lot about him.

794
01:27:10,759 --> 01:27:12,193
I hired him.

795
01:27:13,395 --> 01:27:15,159
What?

796
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,698
He arranged everything for me.

797
01:27:16,765 --> 01:27:21,225
The bag, the gun,
the phone, everything.

798
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:28,202
Oh, well, you're really smart, Mr. Kai.

799
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:31,193
Don't go. Make a choice.

800
01:29:33,134 --> 01:29:35,660
Take me and my brother to Hawaii.

801
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,732
We can go fishing.

802
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:48,008
That would be nice.

803
01:29:49,417 --> 01:29:54,014
Fishing with you...
and your brother.

804
01:30:03,531 --> 01:30:04,862
Good luck...

805
01:30:08,303 --> 01:30:09,793
Khun Fha.

806
01:32:14,662 --> 01:32:16,027
Hey!

807
01:32:19,267 --> 01:32:21,736
Hey, you motherfucker!

808
01:32:23,171 --> 01:32:25,196
You got all these guys
fighting for you,

809
01:32:25,273 --> 01:32:26,707
you can't do it yourself?

810
01:32:27,909 --> 01:32:30,708
Huh? One guy.

811
01:32:30,779 --> 01:32:32,838
One guy!

812
01:32:32,914 --> 01:32:37,215
Huh? You fucker! Come out!

813
01:32:37,285 --> 01:32:38,548
Come out!

814
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:42,524
You, deal with me, old man!

815
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:43,989
Tough guy!

816
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:46,026
Come here, fuckhead!

817
01:32:46,094 --> 01:32:47,220
Huh?

818
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:49,819
You want me to come inside?

819
01:32:49,898 --> 01:32:52,833
I'll fucking come inside.
I'll find you.

820
01:33:06,748 --> 01:33:08,341
Hold on a second.

821
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:17,281
You're really aggressive.

822
01:33:17,392 --> 01:33:19,019
You've got nice hair.

823
01:33:21,362 --> 01:33:25,196
I admire you, I really do.

824
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:27,428
You know, it's impressive
what you've done here tonight.

825
01:33:27,535 --> 01:33:29,560
Well, I'm not finished yet.

826
01:33:29,637 --> 01:33:31,628
And I'm only getting started.

827
01:33:34,576 --> 01:33:38,479
As you know, I don't usually
involve myself personally in anything.

828
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:42,448
I like to manipulate things.

829
01:33:43,651 --> 01:33:45,642
But I'm really gonna enjoy this.

830
01:33:48,823 --> 01:33:51,690
It's been a long time
since I killed anyone.

831
01:34:04,138 --> 01:34:06,505
You shot a 22-year-old boy.

832
01:34:08,276 --> 01:34:09,869
That's cold-blooded, dude.

833
01:34:09,978 --> 01:34:13,346
Yeah, well...

834
01:34:15,049 --> 01:34:16,676
I'm not done yet.

835
01:34:16,784 --> 01:34:19,151
You Hawaiian man.

836
01:34:20,388 --> 01:34:22,652
They certainly don't make 'em
like you anymore.

837
01:34:24,726 --> 01:34:29,357
You're pissed at me because I helped
some rich parents get their son off.

838
01:34:29,464 --> 01:34:30,954
I didn't kill your family.

839
01:34:31,032 --> 01:34:33,467
They'd be dead if I stepped in or not.

840
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:36,402
So is this all worth it?

841
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:40,335
Yeah.

842
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:42,673
It's worth it.

843
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:44,975
Maybe.

844
01:34:46,548 --> 01:34:48,209
I took my shot.

845
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:52,842
Now you take yours.

846
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:29,553
Come on!

847
01:35:42,837 --> 01:35:45,169
Ow, fuck!

848
01:35:46,541 --> 01:35:48,100
Shit.

849
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:52,235
Goddamn.

850
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:55,814
Kai!

851
01:35:59,454 --> 01:36:00,944
I should just shoot you.

852
01:36:01,956 --> 01:36:03,390
Kai, Kai...

853
01:36:03,458 --> 01:36:05,893
It's me.

854
01:36:07,562 --> 01:36:08,961
Who the fuck are you?

855
01:36:09,964 --> 01:36:11,728
Who the fuck are you?

856
01:36:14,335 --> 01:36:15,632
You're the cab driver.

857
01:36:16,838 --> 01:36:18,932
She's not involved.

858
01:36:21,142 --> 01:36:23,736
Wait, you actually care about her?

859
01:36:23,811 --> 01:36:25,336
She took bribe money.

860
01:36:25,446 --> 01:36:30,782
Yeah, you didn't give her a choice.

861
01:36:30,852 --> 01:36:33,321
True. Details.

862
01:36:34,656 --> 01:36:36,146
Let her go.

863
01:36:36,257 --> 01:36:38,919
How the fuck
are you still standing?

864
01:36:39,927 --> 01:36:41,326
Please...

865
01:36:42,430 --> 01:36:43,795
let her go.

866
01:36:48,503 --> 01:36:50,198
I'm gonna have to say no.

867
01:36:51,606 --> 01:36:53,233
But I'm gonna be a nice guy.

868
01:36:54,409 --> 01:36:56,138
I'm gonna give you a choice.

869
01:36:57,412 --> 01:36:59,471
Who do I shoot first?

870
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:11,925
Sorry.

871
01:37:14,462 --> 01:37:15,987
Me too.

872
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:25,666
Her.

873
01:37:28,309 --> 01:37:30,334
Wise choice.

874
01:37:52,834 --> 01:37:54,495
Is this on me too?

875
01:37:57,238 --> 01:37:59,172
I'm sorry about the cop.

876
01:38:01,275 --> 01:38:03,039
And the nurse.

877
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:11,079
She has all the evidence
to clear my family's name.

878
01:38:12,086 --> 01:38:13,451
Please do it.

879
01:38:17,959 --> 01:38:19,757
I held her hostage.

880
01:38:21,195 --> 01:38:23,186
I threatened her brother.

881
01:38:25,066 --> 01:38:27,034
I forced her into this.

882
01:38:30,872 --> 01:38:32,704
Please, call an ambulance.

883
01:38:34,308 --> 01:38:35,571
I already have.

884
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:37,874
I'm dead.

885
01:38:39,313 --> 01:38:40,610
You know that.

886
01:38:45,219 --> 01:38:46,880
I know I don't deserve it...

887
01:38:48,589 --> 01:38:50,455
but I have a request.

888
01:39:31,265 --> 01:39:32,664
Thank you.

889
01:43:17,913 --> 01:43:22,913
