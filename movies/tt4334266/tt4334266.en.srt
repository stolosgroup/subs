Look, I ain't got no problem.

219
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:25,319
No problem with you.

220
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,037
You're a Bridge person.

221
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:42,753
We're just out here
looking for plates, that's all.

222
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,716
That's right.

223
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:49,885
Looking for plates.

224
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,560
Honey, stay back.

225
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,529
Does your kid eat people, too?

226
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:13,534
I'm just trying
to live out here,

227
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:14,952
same as you.

228
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:18,080
Ain't easy for me neither.

229
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:37,474
Look, we the same, we are.

230
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:39,893
No, we ain't.

231
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:41,770
We ain't the same.

232
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,357
We both Bad Batch, right?

233
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:47,192
We ain't the fuckin' same!

234
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:48,360
Do you hear me?

235
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,163
Please.

236
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,623
Just let us go.

237
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:03,959
Yeah, I did that.

238
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:06,295
Begged.

239
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:07,921
Pleaded.

240
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,507
Just like you're doing.

241
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,765
Tell me what you want.

242
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:19,099
I'll do it.

243
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:25,439
So, tell me
what you want me to do

244
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,149
- and I'll do it.
- Shut up.

245
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:33,864
Just tell me what you want...

246
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,657
There's fuckin' nothing
you can do.

247
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:55,125
You kind of stink, kid.

248
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,336
You want me to take
your socks off?

249
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:09,514
My name's Arlen.

250
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:11,850
What's your name?

251
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,150
Look, no one cares
about you now.

252
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:25,947
I could have just left you
out there in the desert.

253
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:29,785
Is that where you wanna be?

254
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:31,495
Hmm?

255
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,085
Now, you like this bunny,
don't you?

256
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,382
Do you wanna keep him?

257
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:55,352
Then, you got to do
exactly what I say.

258
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:22,355
That dead woman over there.

259
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,566
There was... a kid was with her.

260
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:27,152
Did you see this kid?

261
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,238
Did you see her?

262
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,160
Did you see her?

263
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:40,248
You better start talking,
old man.

264
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:46,880
Did you see her?

265
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:52,469
What you want?

266
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,269
Keep it steady.

267
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:51,523
Nice straight line.

268
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:55,694
Let me see.

269
00:44:58,279 --> 00:44:59,489
That's good.

270
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:04,077
A little bit more down here.

271
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:23,948
Yeah, baby.

272
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:37,337
Come on, baby! Do that move!

273
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,671
Move it down.

274
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:45,970
Dang, baby!

275
00:46:46,763 --> 00:46:48,389
People of Comfort,

276
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:50,141
good evening!

277
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,605

Give us The Dream!

282
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:08,493
Make some noise

283
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:10,829
for the one and only!

284
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:18,461
The Dream!

285
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:31,724
Come on, Dream!
Change my life!

286
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:36,020
He looked at me!
He looked at me!

287
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:37,856
- We love you!
- I love you, too.

288
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:42,527
Heal my life with The Dream!

289
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:47,574
I've been wanting
to dream all my life!

290
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:51,327
Come on now, Dream!

291
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:58,459
I love you, Dream!

292
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:05,425
I've got a question.

293
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:08,928
Why are we out here?

294
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:10,471
Just what are we doing
in the middle

295
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:12,515
of the goddamn desert tonight?

296
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:15,685
Jimmy! Jimmy!

297
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,354
That's right. That's right.

298
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:20,398
You want that music
only Jimmy can make.

299
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:28,698
Let me tell you
something about Jimmy.

300
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,076
You know why Jimmy's here?

301
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,828
- Why?
- Jimmy!

302
00:48:33,912 --> 00:48:36,915
- Why?
- He's Bad Batch.

303
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,374
Yeah, yeah!

304
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:40,168
Bad Batch, fucker!

305
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:43,129
Nonfunctioning
member of society.

306
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,048
That's what they told him.

307
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:47,342
That's right.

308
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,178
All of us here,

309
00:48:50,762 --> 00:48:52,180
we weren't good enough.

310
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:53,973
Smart enough.

311
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:55,600
- Yeah!
- Young enough.

312
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,477
- Healthy enough.
- You're right!

313
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,853
Wealthy enough.

314
00:48:59,354 --> 00:49:01,230
Sane enough.

315
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:04,400
Freaks.

316
00:49:05,944 --> 00:49:07,695
Parasites.

317
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:10,490
Bad Batch!
Motherfucking Bad Batch!

318
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:12,575
This here is the Bad Batch.

319
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:15,244
Bad Batch, bitches!

320
00:49:15,328 --> 00:49:17,956
We ain't good. We're bad.

321
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:20,708
Yeah, yeah,
that's right, Bad Batch!

322
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:22,835
Yeah, Bad Batch.

323
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:26,673
That's right.

324
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:29,300
We're bad, baby!

325
00:49:30,093 --> 00:49:32,220
Now, there's only one rule here,

326
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:34,806
and it's this.

327
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:38,309
It's time to wake up.

328
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:41,771
It's time to find... The Dream.

329
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:43,021
The Dream!

330
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:51,614
All glory to The Dream!

331
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:59,372
We're a Bad Batch,
motherfuckers!

332
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:01,582
Bad Batch, motherfuckers!

333
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:26,000
Yeah!

334
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,879
Yee-haw!

335
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,427
- Yeah.
- What's wrong with that?

336
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:45,853
Is this your rabbit?

337
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:46,663
<i>Where is she?</i>

338
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:48,666
<i>She was just right here?</i>

339
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:50,084
<i>That kid.</i>

340
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:52,461
<i>She was right here a second ago.</i>

341
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:54,714
<i>She was right here a second ago.</i>

342
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:56,382
<i>She's got to be here somewhere.</i>

343
00:52:56,465 --> 00:52:58,176
<i>Where did that kid go?</i>

344
00:52:58,259 --> 00:52:59,719
<i>I lost her.</i>

345
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:01,846
<i>That kid. I hope she's okay.</i>

346
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,598
<i>What did I do?
She's got to be here.</i>

347
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,183
<i>I know she's got to be here.</i>

348
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,643
<i>She's got to be here somewhere.</i>

349
00:53:09,145 --> 00:53:11,689
<i>What did I do? What did I do?</i>

350
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,067
<i>Where did that kid go?</i>

351
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,992
Hey, you guys seen a little girl?

352
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:31,959
Hey, you seen a kid?

353
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:39,050
<i>What am I gonna do now?</i>

354
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:47,016
<i>I hate this place.</i>

355
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,852
<i>What is this place?</i>

356
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:51,896
<i>This place.</i>

357
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:54,607
<i>What is this place?</i>

358
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:56,651
<i>What is this place?</i>

359
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:06,911
<i>Here's what you do.</i>

360
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:09,247
<i>Okay, here's what you do.</i>

361
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:12,041
<i>Go somewhere. Go far away.</i>

362
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:13,876
<i>You go far away.</i>

363
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,086
<i>Somewhere. Leave Comfort.</i>

364
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:16,796
<i>Leave Comfort.</i>

365
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:19,131
<i>Just go for a walk.</i>

366
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:22,677
<i>Just go for a walk.</i>

367
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,140
<i>Somewhere. Anywhere.</i>

368
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:05,136
<i>Wow.</i>

369
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:08,723
<i>It's so big.</i>

370
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:10,308
<i>Wow.</i>

371
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:13,602
<i>So big.</i>

372
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:18,357
<i>Wow.</i>

373
00:55:18,441 --> 00:55:19,984
<i>It's so big.</i>

374
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:22,069
<i>Wow! It's so big.</i>

375
00:55:22,153 --> 00:55:26,157
<i>It's pretty, so pretty.</i>

376
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:31,579
<i>Is that what
it always looks like?</i>

377
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:35,374
<i>Doesn't always look like that.</i>

378
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:03,110
<i>Wow.</i>

379
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:39,373
<i>Thought it was
pretty at first, but...</i>

380
00:57:41,459 --> 00:57:44,044
<i>now, I'm not so sure.</i>

381
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:52,303
<i>I don't even really know
what it is.</i>

382
00:57:59,185 --> 00:58:01,270
<i>Do you?</i>

383
00:58:36,889 --> 00:58:38,390
<i>You're big.</i>

384
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:47,483
<i>Strange, isn't it?</i>

385
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:50,736
<i>Here we are</i>

386
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:54,573
<i>in the darkest corner
of this Earth,</i>

387
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:58,786
<i>and we're afraid
of our own kind.</i>

388
00:59:55,968 --> 00:59:57,511
<i>Hmm.</i>

389
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,628
You know where you are?

390
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:48,687
You are a long way from Comfort.

391
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:50,814
And without this,

392
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:53,067
you go nowhere.

393
01:01:23,222 --> 01:01:25,057
Did you see a kid
look like that?

394
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:34,525
Did you see her?

395
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,819
No.

396
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:49,581
I'm going
to take you to Comfort,

397
01:01:49,665 --> 01:01:51,250
and you will go inside

398
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:53,001
and find her for me.

399
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:18,318
Listen to me good.

400
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:24,825
I don't care
about nothing or nobody

401
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:26,952
except that little girl.

402
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:32,499
And I'm going to kill you

403
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:34,334
if you don't find her for me.

404
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:37,713
Comprende?

405
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:44,261
Mm.

406
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:49,326
Vámonos!

407
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:50,828
I'm thirsty.

408
01:03:51,787 --> 01:03:54,331
This make you more thirsty.

409
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:58,752
We got guns at the wall.

410
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:00,838
They'll shoot if they see you.

411
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:03,757
Mm.

412
01:04:08,387 --> 01:04:09,555
So what?

413
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,390
That's your kid?

414
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:15,811
What if I can't find her?

415
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:20,858
You will find her.

416
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:40,187
Trade you for that leg.

417
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:23,522
I'm being friendly, dude.

418
01:06:24,523 --> 01:06:26,316
I can just keep it all
for myself.

419
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:27,985
It's up to you.

420
01:07:05,022 --> 01:07:06,398
Wait!

421
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:07,733
No!

422
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:16,700
Mm!

423
01:07:18,577 --> 01:07:20,579
Fuck.

424
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:22,581
Mm-hmm.

425
01:07:25,917 --> 01:07:27,127
No.

426
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:29,379
No, no, no, no! No!

427
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:46,146
Let me go!

428
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:48,982
Aah!

429
01:09:09,146 --> 01:09:10,564
Vámonos!

430
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,400
Would you turn around,
please?

431
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:41,464
What's your deal?

432
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:44,009
How come
you're in the Bad Batch?

433
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:50,974
Gang related?

434
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:57,689
Drug related?

435
01:12:03,111 --> 01:12:04,696
Illegal.

436
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,157
No papers.

437
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:12,162
You a Mexican?

438
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:17,125
Cubano, from Havana.

439
01:12:23,548 --> 01:12:25,467
I heard of Cuba.

440
01:12:26,301 --> 01:12:28,178
That's in the tropics, right?

441
01:12:29,304 --> 01:12:30,597
Near Hawaii?

442
01:13:06,091 --> 01:13:07,801
Here is Cuba.

443
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:11,096
I am born here, in Havana.

444
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:14,766
I come with a boat to America
when I'm 16.

445
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:17,185
To Miami.

446
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:18,560
Miami.

447
01:13:18,937 --> 01:13:20,271
What did you do there?

448
01:13:20,688 --> 01:13:22,816
Like, what did you do in Miami?

449
01:13:25,235 --> 01:13:26,736
A lot of thing.

450
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:28,822
I make tattoos,

451
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,782
construction.

452
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:31,991
I do this, that.

453
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:33,326
No big deal.

454
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:37,622
I got this one when I was 13.

455
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:40,500
And this.

456
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:54,013
See this one?

457
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:58,059
It's from the first boy
I ever loved.

458
01:13:58,435 --> 01:14:00,186
He was a musician.

459
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:03,356
We both got matching ones
at the same time.

460
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:09,320
And this one,

461
01:14:09,404 --> 01:14:10,780
5040.

462
01:14:13,992 --> 01:14:15,326
What's your number?

463
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:22,375
Come on.

464
01:14:23,168 --> 01:14:24,335
What's your number?

465
01:14:32,177 --> 01:14:33,595
What's the big deal?

466
01:14:35,889 --> 01:14:37,807
Just show me your number.

467
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:10,465
Your kind,

468
01:15:11,049 --> 01:15:12,342
you're evil.

469
01:15:13,885 --> 01:15:15,178
That's what you are.

470
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:16,513
Evil.

471
01:15:20,308 --> 01:15:22,227
You don't see things
how they are.

472
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:25,396
You only see things
how you are.

473
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:26,773
I don't care.

474
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:28,942
I hate you.

475
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,527
Get it?

476
01:15:33,488 --> 01:15:35,198
I hate all of y'all.

477
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:42,288
No problema para mí.

478
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:44,249
It's okay.

479
01:15:56,594 --> 01:15:58,680
Doesn't change nothing for me.

480
01:16:00,098 --> 01:16:02,475
Doesn't change nothing for you.

481
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:20,285
Ohh.

482
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:28,459
Ohh!

483
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:45,184
Come on. Come with me.

484
01:16:45,268 --> 01:16:46,728
Come on.

485
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:01,034
Let's go, man. I'm getting
the fuck out of here.

486
01:17:07,624 --> 01:17:09,626
Come on.
Hurry the fuck up.

487
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:16,424
Let's go now.

488
01:17:31,064 --> 01:17:32,398
Open up.

489
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:37,487
Close it up.

490
01:17:40,365 --> 01:17:42,575
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's going on?

491
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:43,660
What's your number, fool?

492
01:17:43,743 --> 01:17:45,244
5828.

493
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:47,038
Been out in the desert
two days, man.

494
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:48,206
I need some food.

495
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:49,957
Are you guys gonna help me
out or what?

496
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:51,542
What's up
with the white girl, man?

497
01:17:51,626 --> 01:17:54,170
Found her ass out there
with one of them Bridge people.

498
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:55,380
All right, kick back, homey.

499
01:17:55,463 --> 01:17:57,023
- Thanks, man.
- Welcome to Comfort ese.

500
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:58,383

Excuse me.

Have you seen this kid?

547
01:25:51,272 --> 01:25:52,314
No.

548
01:25:52,398 --> 01:25:54,066
You seen this kid?

549
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:55,860
No.

550
01:25:55,943 --> 01:25:57,736
Excuse me, sir.

551
01:25:58,195 --> 01:25:59,780
Have you seen this kid
anywhere?

552
01:25:59,864 --> 01:26:00,781
Uh-uh.

553
01:26:00,865 --> 01:26:02,408
No?

554
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:05,619
Can you look out
for her, please?

555
01:26:12,168 --> 01:26:13,270
Oh, he ain't
ever gonna be wasted.

556
01:26:13,294 --> 01:26:15,254
Hey, have you guys
seen a little girl?

557
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:18,132
I ain't seen shit, man.

558
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:27,516
I wish they'd stop
making pennies.

559
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:30,186
I hate pennies.

560
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:31,353
I hate 'em!

561
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:32,563
Hey!

562
01:26:32,646 --> 01:26:34,648
- I keep losing things.
- Hey.

563
01:26:34,732 --> 01:26:36,817
Don't wanna be a loser.
I wanna be a finder.

564
01:26:36,901 --> 01:26:39,069
Finder finds things.
Loser loses them.

565
01:26:39,486 --> 01:26:41,280
Yeah. I need to find a kid.

566
01:26:41,363 --> 01:26:42,531
A little girl.

567
01:26:42,781 --> 01:26:44,033
Yeah.

568
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:46,243
- She's about this tall.
- Yeah.

569
01:26:46,327 --> 01:26:47,661
- You've seen her?
- Yeah.

570
01:26:47,745 --> 01:26:49,246
- Where?
- Hey, you wanna play

571
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:50,331
with my puzzle?

572
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:53,959
You wanna play?

573
01:26:55,211 --> 01:26:57,379
No, I'm not gonna play
with your puzzle.

574
01:26:57,463 --> 01:26:59,506
- Thank you.
- I'll call you later.

576
01:32:10,776 --> 01:32:12,402

Yeah.

That's the economy of Comfort

01:33:48,832 --> 01:33:51,793
See, you can catch
more flies with honey.

591
01:33:53,629 --> 01:33:55,797
But who wants flies?

592
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:03,680
Remind me your name again,

593
01:34:03,764 --> 01:34:05,140
Sweetheart.

594
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:07,684
It's Arlen.

595
01:34:10,145 --> 01:34:12,272
Let me ask you
a question, Arlen.

596
01:34:12,773 --> 01:34:14,941
When you shit here in Comfort,

597
01:34:15,025 --> 01:34:16,568
your shit goes away.

598
01:34:16,652 --> 01:34:18,153
That accurate?

599
01:34:18,236 --> 01:34:19,655
I guess.

600
01:34:19,738 --> 01:34:21,156
You shit.

601
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:23,075
It leaves.

602
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:25,452
You know why it leaves?

603
01:34:27,704 --> 01:34:29,164
Um...

604
01:34:30,832 --> 01:34:34,753
because the toilet
takes it someplace?

605
01:34:35,796 --> 01:34:37,464
Yes, it does.

606
01:34:39,424 --> 01:34:41,301
Takes it where it takes it...

607
01:34:43,053 --> 01:34:44,805
because of me.

608
01:34:49,017 --> 01:34:51,311
'Cause I hate the idea

609
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,855
that my sons and daughters

610
01:34:53,939 --> 01:34:56,566
would have to stew
in their own shit.

611
01:35:00,529 --> 01:35:02,656
Cows stand in their shit.

612
01:35:04,908 --> 01:35:06,827
They stand in their shit...

613
01:35:07,953 --> 01:35:09,996
'cause they're cows.

614
01:35:10,372 --> 01:35:12,457
Pigs stand in their shit...

615
01:35:13,166 --> 01:35:15,043
'cause they're pigs.

616
01:35:18,046 --> 01:35:19,756
Some misbehaving humans

617
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,550
been making hamburgers
out of my sons

618
01:35:21,633 --> 01:35:22,968
and daughters.

619
01:35:24,094 --> 01:35:26,012
We are not cows.

620
01:35:27,139 --> 01:35:29,391
We don't stand in our shit.

621
01:35:30,809 --> 01:35:32,352
Reason we don't...

622
01:35:33,437 --> 01:35:35,814
is because
I won't let that happen.

623
01:35:37,274 --> 01:35:39,151
I got each and every toilet
in Comfort

624
01:35:39,234 --> 01:35:42,362
taking that shit
from all your little asses

625
01:35:43,029 --> 01:35:44,281
and sending it down the pipes

626
01:35:44,364 --> 01:35:45,699
till it reaches a place

627
01:35:45,782 --> 01:35:48,076
where no one thinks about it

628
01:35:48,827 --> 01:35:50,245
and no one smells it.

629
01:35:51,288 --> 01:35:52,998
Ain't that nice of me?

630
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:08,972
But you don't like it here,

631
01:36:10,056 --> 01:36:11,641
do you?

632
01:36:16,605 --> 01:36:18,064
No, I just...

633
01:36:20,984 --> 01:36:23,320
Costs a lot to be here.

634
01:36:24,905 --> 01:36:27,157
Cost you an arm and a leg.

635
01:36:30,243 --> 01:36:32,370
Where would you rather be?

636
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:48,512
It's all right.

637
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:06,530
You know what I see
when I look at you?

638
01:37:08,073 --> 01:37:10,700
A sailboat out in the sea...

639
01:37:12,619 --> 01:37:14,454
with no wind.

640
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:22,337
What is it you want, Arlen?

641
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:25,757
If you could have one thing,

642
01:37:26,174 --> 01:37:27,425
anything,

643
01:37:28,510 --> 01:37:30,011
what would it be?

644
01:37:31,096 --> 01:37:31,930
Anything?

645
01:37:32,013 --> 01:37:33,849
Anything at all.

646
01:37:39,062 --> 01:37:40,647
A time machine.

647
01:37:43,066 --> 01:37:44,442
Why?

648
01:37:45,777 --> 01:37:47,279
So I could go back.

649
01:37:47,654 --> 01:37:49,739
Fix things.

650
01:37:50,949 --> 01:37:52,367
Make it better.

651
01:37:55,287 --> 01:37:57,414
All the things you've done

652
01:37:58,540 --> 01:38:00,333
have put you right here,

653
01:38:01,167 --> 01:38:02,669
on this couch,

654
01:38:02,919 --> 01:38:04,588
in this room,

655
01:38:04,671 --> 01:38:06,506
with me.

656
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:13,930
Close your eyes.

657
01:38:17,684 --> 01:38:19,185
Close them.

658
01:38:28,737 --> 01:38:31,323
What do you really want?

659
01:38:37,412 --> 01:38:40,248
I wanna be the solution
for something.

660
01:38:50,175 --> 01:38:52,010
You know what this is?

661
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:54,429
It's a tomato.

662
01:38:57,182 --> 01:38:58,600
First,

663
01:39:00,518 --> 01:39:02,270
it was a seed.

664
01:39:04,105 --> 01:39:06,107
You take care of a garden,

665
01:39:06,733 --> 01:39:09,027
and it takes care of you back.

666
01:39:09,444 --> 01:39:10,987
You feed it,

667
01:39:11,529 --> 01:39:13,490
it feeds you.

668
01:39:13,865 --> 01:39:15,325
Few things in this world

669
01:39:15,408 --> 01:39:16,910
operate like that,

670
01:39:17,243 --> 01:39:18,954
fair and square.

671
01:39:21,998 --> 01:39:24,334
It just needs a place to grow.

672
01:39:29,965 --> 01:39:33,551
It grows and grows.

673
01:39:35,345 --> 01:39:37,097
Then it comes out

674
01:39:37,847 --> 01:39:39,808
and it's part of the world.

675
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:43,687
Because you know what
The Dream really is?

676
01:39:46,314 --> 01:39:47,607
It's life.

677
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:49,734
Life is The Dream.

678
01:39:51,277 --> 01:39:53,196
The only dream.

679
01:40:08,461 --> 01:40:10,213
I want The Dream.

680
01:40:10,922 --> 01:40:12,674
What dream is that?

681
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:14,926
This one here.

682
01:40:16,594 --> 01:40:18,388
Like they have.

683
01:40:33,486 --> 01:40:35,780
Make up a room for our guest.

684
01:42:06,287 --> 01:42:08,123
Is everything okay?

685
01:42:27,392 --> 01:42:30,436
Hey. I'm sorry.

686
01:42:32,355 --> 01:42:34,440
I guess I'm just a bit nervous.

687
01:42:34,524 --> 01:42:36,025
That's okay.

688
01:42:36,401 --> 01:42:37,819
Can you come in for a second?

689
01:42:39,028 --> 01:42:41,114
Yeah, of course.

690
01:43:04,304 --> 01:43:06,598
Is this really necessary?

691
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:15,773
Come here, kid.

692
01:43:16,983 --> 01:43:18,234
We're going.

693
01:43:21,196 --> 01:43:22,655
Bring her down!

694
01:43:23,323 --> 01:43:25,825
You wanna see it all over
your fucking walls?

695
01:43:54,646 --> 01:43:55,897
Come here.

696
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:01,819
Promise me something.

697
01:44:03,529 --> 01:44:05,615
Take care of this rabbit.

698
01:44:06,366 --> 01:44:08,284
Come on.

699
01:44:09,994 --> 01:44:11,621
Yeah.

700
01:44:12,622 --> 01:44:14,332
When we're out
and clear of the wall,

701
01:44:14,415 --> 01:44:15,416
I'll let her go.

702
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,335
Come here.

703
01:44:17,877 --> 01:44:19,504
Let's go, kid.

704
01:44:20,338 --> 01:44:22,882
I'm real disappointed
in you, Arlen.

705
01:44:24,717 --> 01:44:26,636
Real disappointed.

706
01:44:36,896 --> 01:44:38,356
Once we're out,
I'll let her go.

707
01:44:38,439 --> 01:44:39,732
I swear.

708
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:55,123
Yo, check this shit
out right here, homes.

709
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:57,458
- Open it, Nacho.
- Open the gate, homes.

710
01:44:57,542 --> 01:44:58,751
Open it!

711
01:45:02,088 --> 01:45:03,172
Come on.

712
01:45:06,884 --> 01:45:08,261

713
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:12,181
